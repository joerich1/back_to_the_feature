ROLL CREDITS AND THEME MUSIC
DISSOLVE TO

EXT A FOREST CLEARING - EARLY MORNING

The crust of an old snowfall still covers the frozen ground
and the bare icy branches of the trees glisten dully in the
early morning light

CUT TO

INT TV STUDIO - SAME TIME

PHIL CONNORS is standing in front of a blank green wall
gesticulating animatedly at some invisible images on the wall
talking a mile a minute (MOS) He looks completely crazy as he
points at nothing and winks to an unseen audience

CUT TO

EXT WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA - SAME TIME

CREDITS CONTINUE as we streak across the winter landscape
flying over fields and farms small towns and hamlets railroad
lines and interstates coalyards and factories until we cross
the Allegheny River and follow it to the southwest

CUT TO

INT TV STUDIO - SAME TIME

Phil continues pointing out features on the blank wall but
from a new angle we can see that he s looking at a monitor out
of the corner of his eye which shows the chromakey insert hes
pointing to — a national weather map

CUT TO

EXT NEAR PITTSBURGH - SAME TIME

The country towns turn to suburbs traffic on the roads gets
heavier and finally we see the skyline of Pittsburgh and the
confluence of the Allegheny with the Monongahela and the Ohio

We zoom into a tall building in the downtown area and

DISSOLVE TO

INT PHIL CONNORS OFFICE - MORNING

We dont see anyone at first but the office itself speaks
volumes about its inhabitant— team pictures of the Steelers
from the Franco Harris-Terry Bradshaw glory years a framed
memorial portrait of Roberto Clemente a local Emmy award
statue an erasable weather map and mountains of personal junk
on the desk “windowsill and every other available surface

As the CREDITS END we notice a sleeping figure on the small
sofa buried deep under a pile of coats and a stolen airline
blanket

GIL HAWLEY Executive Producer of the Action News sticks his
head in the door

HAWLEY
Christ what a pit Phil

The sleeping figure rouses himself and looks out at Hawley
Its Phil the Channel 9 Action News weatherman

PHIL

(sleepy)
What

HAWLEY
Its February first Phil You
know what tomorrow is

Phil sits up andthinks hard Hes in his mid-thirties smart
rugged-looking perhaps a little too full of himself but
clearly a guy with a lot of personality

PHIL
(catching on)
Oh no Not again

He jumps up and exits the office with Hawley right behind him
PHIL
Forget it Im not going

INT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Hawley pursues Phil through the office suite of the Channel 9
Action News from the look of it a typical big city local
news operation A logo on the wall identifies the station as
WPGH - Pittsburgh

Phil ducks into the studio
INT STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

Hawley follows him in and catches up with him at the weather
corner of the Action News set Phil starts putting weather
stats up on a chart

PHIL
Get away from me Im working

HAWLEY
So whats the outlook We gonna
get that blizzard

Phil shakes his head and points to the chart which is headed
Phils Phorecast with a cute caricature of himself drawn nex
to the title

PHIL
No way All that moisture coming
up from the Gulf is going to miss
us completely and take a dump on
Harrisburg

HAWLEY
(with authority)
Good ‘cause youre going up to
Punxsutawney to cover the
groundhog story tomorrow morning
and I want you back here in time
to do the five

PHIL
Jesus Gil give me a break will
you I covered the goddamn
groundhog last year and the year
before that

HAWLEY
And youll do it next year and
the year after too When I
worked in San Diego I covered
the swallows coming back to
Capistrano for ten years ina
row

PHIL
You shouldve killed the guy who
made you do that

HAWLEY
I wanted to do it
PHIL

Then you shouldve killed
yourself I dont want to get
stuck with the groundhog for the
rest of my life
HAWLEY
Its a cute story He comes out
he looks around he wrinkles up
his little nose he sniffs around
a little he sees his shadow he
doesnt see his shadow— its
nice People like it

PHIL
Many people are morons

HAWLEY
Just do it

PHIL
What11 you give me

Hawley looks across the studio and sees RITA HANSON enter a
very attractive segment producer in her late twenties

HAWLEY
(to Phil)
Ill give you Rita
(calls her over)
Rita could you come here for a
second I got a little job for
you

Rita is relatively new to the station but very competent
personable humorous self-assured and very pretty— in short
a genuine princess though Phil is too self-absorbed at this
point to realize it

PHIL

(teasing)
You cant send Rita out on a
story like this Shes just a
cub a pup still wet behind the
ears ook at her Her ears are
sopping wet This needs a
Woodward or a Bernstein Its a
big story People need to know

RITA
(intrigued)
Whats the story
HAWLEY
The Punxsutawney Groundhog

Festival

Gil if it iM an right with you
Id rather follow-up on the
nurses strike
HAWLEY
You can do the nurses when you
get back Just take the squeaky
Wheel here up to Punxsutawney and
get him back in one piece Okay

RITA
Yeah okay

Hawley exits leaving Phil and Rita alone in the studio She
Knows Phil mainly by his reputation and it isnt good Still
she finds him appealing in an odd way

PHIL
(pleasantly)
You Know this could be extremely
interesting

RITA
Ive never done a weather story
before Whats Punxsutawney
like

PHIL
Oh its an enchanted place A
magical world Its the
Constantinople of the whole
Western Appalachian-Susquehanna
Drainage system

RITA
Do you always joke

PHIL
About 70 to 80 of the time
Inside Im actually a very shy
and sensitive person

RITA
A lot of people around here think
youre not very sincere

PHIL
Tell me the names of these
people

RI
I1l line up a crew and
transportation If you dont
feel Like driving we can all go
up in the van together

PHIL

man
RITA
(exiting)
Nice attitude

PHIL
Nice face
(calls after her)
Why dont you ride up with me

RITA
No thanks

STEPHANIE DECASTRO an attractive dark-eyed dark-haired
correspondent glares at Phil from across the studio

INT PHILS OFFICE - LATER

Phil is in his cluttered cubicle talking on a headset phone
while he reviews cassettes of his groundhog spots from the pas
two years on a small monitor As he talks he stuffs a number
of personal items in an overnight bag all the time watching
himself on the TV monitor

PHIL

(on the phone)
They dont really think of me as
a weatherman around here More
of a personality but with the
credibility of a first-class
broadcast journalist Once you
look at my tape I think youll
see what they mean

Stephanie enters and stands in the doorway looking at Phil for
a long moment There is something vaguely off-center about
this woman not quite FATAL ATTRACTION but still a little
scary

STEPHANIE
(bitterly)
I just want to Know one thing
did I do something wrong or are
you just tired of me or what I
have to know

Phil sighs

PHIL

(on the phone)
Dan can I call you back Ive
just been handed something and I
better get on it

(he picks up some

papers and rustles

them for effect)
OKay thanks
He takes off the headset

privacy

-7-

PHIL

(kindly)
You didnt do anything wrong
Stephanie and Im not tired of
you Its just that I dont have
time for a real relationship
right now I told you that the
first time we went out

STEPHANIE
(getting close)
Everybody says that at the
beginning of a relationship

PHIL
(gently pushing her

awa
Im different I really meant
it Things are really starting
to move for me now Im not
going to be doing the weather for
the rest of my life I was just
talking to the CBS guy abouta
network job I want that This
is just the beginning for me I
cant waste any more time

STEPHANIE
Are you saying our relationship
was a waste of time

PHIL
Our relationship We went out a
total of four times And only
twice did anything happen It
was fun but dont see that as
a big commitment

STEPHANIE
(closing in again)
I had our charts done My
astrologer says were extremely
compatible There may even be
some past lives involvement here

PHIL
See So weve already done this
Lets move on Next case

STEPHANIE
You know whats wrong with you
Phil Youre selfish You dont
have time for anyone but
yourself

gets up and closes the door for
PHIL
Thats what Im trying to tell
you You dont want to be with
me You can do better Look
Stephanie if I ever said or did
anything to mislead you Im sorry
for that but right now I have to
do this groundhog thing and I
dont have a handle on it yet

He throws some papers and his datebook into a briefcase and
puts on his jacket

PHIL (CONT )

He pats her on the shoulder and brushes past her leaving het
standing there with a malevolent look on her face

I wonder what the weathers going
to be like for all the
festivities

overcast high today in the low
30s dropping to the low 20s
tonight but Im predicting that
all that moisture coming up from
the Gulf is going to miss us and
dump some locally heavy snow
possibly blizzard conditions with
travel advisories in the
Harrisburg area and maybe as far
east as Philadelphia

dirt enclosed by a rail fence walting for the big moment Fo
a cold gray dawn there is the atmosphere of a festival here

An area close to the mound is roped off for news reporters and
cameras Rita stands there a pocket of genuine beauty in this

most famous weatherman the
groundhog who as legend has it
can predict the coming of an
early spring

Rita turns to Larry This is impressive— so far so good

A Groundhog Club Official kneels at the burrow and
ceremoniously knocks on the small wooden door then opens it
and retreats

PHIL
And heres the big moment weve
all been waiting for Lets just
see what Mr Groundhog has to
say

The groundhog sticks his head out looks around steps out of
the hole and runs over to the other side of the mound about
as far away from the cameras as he can get

PHIL
Hey Over here you little
weasel

Larry zooms in as far as he can but the best he can manage is
a close-up of the groundhogs back The groundhog stands there
a moment his body casting a tong shadow then he lets out a
squeak and runs back into the hole

PHIL
Great shot huh folks Well
that was certainly worth the
trip Now well be hearing from
Mr Buster Greene President of
the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club

will interpret for us

BUSTER
He came out and he saw his
shadow Sorry ladies and
gentlemen but it looks like its
going to be a long winter

The crowd lets out a good-natured Awwwwww in disappointment

PHIL

(sarcastic to camera)
Well thats it Sorry you
couldnt be here in person to

really fails to capture the
excitement of thousands of people
gathered to watch a large
squirrel predict the weather and
I for one am deeply grateful to
have been a part of it

Larry cuts the camera

Everybodys here on Gobblers
Knob waiting in the cold for the
appearance of the most famous
groundhog in the world
Punxsutawney Phil whos going to

this we can expect

The Groundhog Club Official Knocks on the groundhogs door
then opens it and retreats

Phil takes a deep breath and makes his first experimental
prediction recalling the previous day

PHIL
My forecast is were going to see
the groundhog peek its head out
of its hole look around a little
bit then hes going to come out
scamper over to this general
area look at the crowd for a
second make a little burping
noise and run back into the
ground

RITA
(whispers to Larry)
Thats it Im going to kill
him

Phil Looks at his watch

PHIL
Okay And here we go—

Phil points to the hole and Larry zooms in

The groundhog sticks his head out looks left looks right
steps out of the hole and runs away from the press pool
directly over to Larrys camera As he stands there his body
casts a long shadow The groundhog looks right into the
camera lets out a squeak and runs back into the hole

Rita and Larry are completely amazed as the crowd cheers the
brief appearance of the groundhog Larry pans back to Phil

Phil just stands there speechless staring at the groundhog
burrow

RITA
(hisses)
Phil

Buster Greene the Groundhog club official walks onto the
mound and hushes the crowd exactly as before

BUSTER
He came out and he saw his
shadow Sorry ladies and
gentlemen but it looks like its
going to be a long winter

Again the crowd lets out a good-natured Awwwwww in
disappointment

Larry pans back to Phil just in time to see him walking away i
a fog without signing off Then he pans back to Rita

wood splintering and glass breaking

INT PHILS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Phil has demolished just about all the furniture and woodwork
in the room He rips off the last of the wooden moldings with
the crowbar then crosses to the mirror over the demolished
sink

Phil stands there staring at his image in the mirror trying
to figure out whats happening to him He starts breathing
heavier as if gather ing courage then just when we think he
going to cut off his ear or something he raises an electric
barber clipper and shaves a bald stripe up the middle of his
head He studies his new look for a moment then smashes the
mirror with his sledgehammer

Then he opens the cans of paint dips the two big brushes into
the cans and starts slapping bright red paint onto the walls
madly feverishly splashing himself and everything else in the
room with it

As a final touch he grabs the bed pillows and rips them open
then shakes them all around the room creating a storm of
feathers

Finally Phil falls exhausted on the bed From outside we can
hear outraged hotel employees pounding on the door

We pan over to the clock radio the only undamaged object in
the room Feathers drift down past the face of the clock whict
reads 559 AM The time changes to 600 the radio clicks on
and I Got You Babe starts playing as we pan back to Phil
sleeping on the bed

He opens his eyes jumps out of bed and looks around No
paint no feathers no damage Everything is as clean and tid
as the day he checked in

He races over to the unbroken mirror and looks at himself Hi
hair is completely restored as if it had never been shaved

The song ends and the deejays come on Phil says every word

wonderment

In fact the groundhogs
legendary ability to predict the

Higher temperatures trigger
hormonal changes in the
testosterone levels of male
groundhogs which may in fact
wake them from hibernation and
send them out to battle with
other males for mating rights
So the truth is theyre not
looking for their shadows
theyre looking for groundhog
chicks

And so began my final lifetime
and ended the longest winter on
record I would find myself no
longer able to affect the chain
of events in this town but I did
learn something about time You
can waste time you can kill
time you can do time but if you
use it wisely theres never
enough of it So youd better
make the most of the time youve
got

A car skids on the ice and smashes into a tree Phil and Rit
rush over to help but the driver waves that hes okay Rite

Larry never got through the
blizzard so none of my groundhog
reports ever made it on the air
But Rita and I— we lived happily
ever after

Phil and Rita walk off together

Across the street Larry is trying to get rid of Ned Ryerson
who is doggedly trying to sell him insurance

NED
But Phil told me you were his
accountant

LARRY
Look I told you Hes nuts

Larry keeps trying to walk away but Ned wont leave him alone

NED
Let me just tell you about single
premium life—

Finally Larry slugs Ned and storms off leaving Ned
floundering in a snowbank

Phil and Rita walk on as we pull up and away from Main Street
revealing the whole of Punxsutawney and the snowy countryside
that embraces it

THE END
