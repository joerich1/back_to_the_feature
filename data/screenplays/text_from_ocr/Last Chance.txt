1 EXT OLD DEMPSEY MANSION

Clint looks at the house

BLACK SCREEN (PLACED THROUGHOUT FIRST SCENES )

MALE VOICE (VO)
I know what you want to say
Youre sorry Have regrets
Youre tired of the badgering
The pestering

(incredulous )
You cant just fucking wake up
one day and forget about it
-Pretend it isnt there
When something becomes a part
of you
-Like your arms and legs an
appendage you cant live
without Its there forever
Forever
It was there when you were
born
(beat)

Before you were born
This is your last chance to
deal with it

2 EXT OLD DEMPSEY MANSION

Clint continues to look at the house

3 INT OLD DEMPSEY MANSION STAIRWELL

A door SQUEAKS within the dark stairwell FOOTSTEPS
descend WATER dripping from somewhere below Water
hitting water

A PAIR of shoes descend a couple of steps

A startling BANG from above

CLOSE ON
Clint as he stands on the steps Checks behind him up
the steps towards the sound

BLACK SCREEN

MALE VOICE (VO)
Dont worry about them One
generation after another
Still moved by what we did to
those girls

MALE VOICE (VO)
(reminiscing)
Those girls So sweet
Remember They know youll do
it again
(beat)
So do you

Clint forgets about it Continues down the dark wet
stairwell into
4 EXT PARK DAY
Several TEENAGERS surround CLINT (30s) threatening
CLINT
I didnt do anything It
wasnt me
They close it One throws a punch
TEENAGERS beat him Clint lying on the ground in a
fetal position Trickle of blood from his nose He lets
out a silent scream
BLACK SCREEN
MALE VOICE (VO)
Time has a funny way of hiding

things Making them disappear
(beat)
Gives us the false sense of
change when none exists

5 INT OLD DEMPSEY MANSION BEDROOM

Moving boxes here and there The tops forced over
bent Taped haphazardly like a child did it

A plain unmade bed against one wall

Clint stands in front of a wall mirror Cracked and
broken Cant tell whether it is day or night outside
the room Windows covered by old blankets

Putting on a button-up shirt Clint shows off his
extensive BURN SCARS Scars covering most of his torso
and arm Runs his hand across them

BLACK SCREEN

MALE VOICE (VO)
Youre fucking disgusting
Look at you You look like
lunatic Who would want you
Im the only one ever there
for you

BEDROOM

On the empty night stand a medicine bottle HALOPERIDOL
across the front with instructions

Clint does his best to tape up a moving box Goes to
another Stops Takes out several newspaper clipping
and old photos The headline on one newspaper cover
reads Distinguished surgeons 16-year old disabled
son suspect in gruesome murder

A photo of the crime scene below the headline The OLD
NEON COKE SIGN in the background The old mansions
basement

Takes the old newspaper piece lights it with a lighter
throws it in a metal trashcan allowing it to burn
Next a small trophy and a couple of first place
ribbons Childhood memories They too go into the
wastebasket Several Polaroid PHOTOS are next Shows a
FATHER and MOTHER and two young sons one older and
bigger than the other in baseball uniforms

Clint stares at the photos Emotionless

TWO TEENAGERS throw stones at the house breaking a
window They run away

At the restaurant through the back window of the
vehicle The winter cold begging to come in

Clint still sitting checking his rear-view
THE BACKGROUND blurry

A unidentified RED CAR crosses within the view of the
back window and parks out of frame
Through the windows of the restaurant the waitress
grabs a jacket leaves She exits and crosses the

BLACK SCREEN

21 EXT RURAL ROAD DAY

The old Mercedes cruises through an rural two-laned
street Mostly farmland surrounding it
22 INT MERCEDES NIGHT

Clint drives Checks the rear view every now and then
Something up ahead causes him to panic

CLINT
Shoot Shoot Shoot

Road Construction Slowing traffic in front of him
Several WORKERS waving flags Clint pulls right next to
one of the FLAGMEN So close the guy could stick his
head in the window if it were open

Clint avoids eye contact

Finally past Clint checks his rear view again Leaving
the road annoyance behind Turns his head to get a look
into the back seat

THE WAITRESS

Bound and gagged lying on her side She squirms
Muffled BREATHING through the duct tape Fear in her

eyes

The old Mercedes drives along a similar rural two-
laned road

23 EXT ROAD DAY

The Mercedes pulls around

Clint sits in the drivers seat Tire iron in hand
Checks the rear view The waitresss face

MALE VOICE (VO)
At least cover the back seat

CLINT
Im so tired of feeling like
this I hate who I am

Clint breaks down

CLINT
Why did you kill those people
I hate you I hate you Why
What did I do

Clints cries for help turn to anger He grabs the
steering wheel and shakes it violently as if trying to
pull it out of its place

CLINT
I can control you Theyre
wrong Wrong I choose to
listen to you Follow your
suggestions My will over your
instinct
(crying)

CLINT

I just wanted to do right Be
good Thats all I ever wanted
from you Let me know Id done

hold of yourself

Clint grips the handle of the tire iron Prepares
himself The womans scared face in the mirror

MALE VOICE (VO)
Get on with it

CLINT
It will never end You will
never leave me alone

MALE VOICE (VO)
Oh for fucks sake Do it
You poor excuse for a
BAM Without hesitation Clint takes the tire iron and
bangs it against his own head Does it again BAM
Killing the voice

Blood runs down his temple from beneath his winter hat

Clint sits there a moment Gets his bearing
A UNEXPECTED RAP on the window breaks the tension
Startled Clint turns to look

Through the drivers side glass A POLICEMAN about the
same age as Clint waits Taps the window with the
antenna of a RADIO Motions for Clint to roll the
window Clint does reluctantly

The cold air rushes in

CLINT
Hi Oscar

The policeman leans down gets a good look into the
car at Clint Notices the trickle of blood down the
side

POLICEMAN
Everything okay here Are you
injured

CLINT

F-fine Everything is fine
The Policeman holds his gaze on Clints face for what
feels like forever He then moves line of sight
throughout the front seat Holds on the tire iron a
moment

He slowly scans towards the back seat

POLICEMANS POV

Shows an empty back seat He scans the length of the
backseat Nothing there

BACK TO SCENE
Clint stares straight ahead Waits for the Policeman to
visually move through each corner of the Mercedes
Finally back on Clints face

POLICEMAN
You know this aint a place to
be hanging out Wheres your
brother You want me to call
him

CLINT
(quick)
No

POLICEMAN
Everything okay at home
Everything okay with your
brother

CLINT
Yep

POLICEMAN
Things can get real tough out
here Man like you Being in
prison and all Shame what
happened to you back then
Sorry if I was ever mean to
you

Nothing from Clint Hes avoiding the familiar
Policemans stare

POLICEMAN
Good to have you back in any
case Just take care of what
ever you need to take care of
But do it back at home Not
safe out here right now Till
things cool off for you
Clear

CLINT
Clear

POLICEMAN

Clint rolls the power window
The policeman walks towards his waiting police cruiser

Clint watches the Policemen walk towards the rear of
the Mercedes get in his running vehicle

24 EXT OLD MANSION NIGHT

Clints Mercedes pulls to the curb

25 INT OLD MANSION BASEMENT

Clint goes into the basement

26 INT OLD MANSION BASEMENT

An overhead light gently swings from the middle of the
room Beneath it a table with the naked outline of a
womans body The shadows obscuring her torso and face
YELLOW LEG WARMERS on her legs

On a smaller table a pair of hands unrolls a bundled
white roll Within it metal instruments Saws metal
scalpels other cutting devices within smaller pockets

The persons identity hidden within the dark shadows

MALE VOICEKEVIN
What took you so long

CLINT (0S)
Nothing

MALE VOICEKEVIN
I was going to start without
you

Clints voice coming from the stairwell His shoes
visible in the light He descends the steps slowly

Kevin reaches over and pushes the towards the
stairwell illuminating Clint coming down the steps He
lets it go it swings back and forth over the womans
naked figure

CLINTS POV
Kevin sits over the small table inspecting his tools

CLINT
I dont want to do this Kev

MALE VOICEKEVIN
Remember our first girl
Coffee colored hair A hint of
red in her cheeks from the
cold

FLASH OF IMAGES
Of a womans flowing hair rosy cheeks
Clint takes a moment to reminisce

MALE VOICEKEVIN
Touch of perfume

Clint inhales closes his eyes taking in the imagined
smell

MALE VOICEKEVIN
Fifteen years Ive waited for
this moment For our time
together Were a family
again little brother Isnt
it great

Clint puts his hands on his ears Squeezes his eyes
closed

CLINT

MALE VOICEKEVIN
Its okay little brother
Dont be ashamed of what we
did

CLINT

MALE VOICEKEVIN

You could have stopped it
anytime you wanted But you
didnt

CLINT
Youre wrong

MALE VOICEKEVIN
You cant just wake up one day
and forget about it Pretend
it isnt there

Clint approaches the table slowly

MALE VOICEKEVIN
This is who we are little
brother

Kevin pulls a sharp instrument a curved knife Runs a
sharpening stone across it

CLINT
I suffered in that place
for you

MALE VOICEKEVIN
I suffered the fifteen years
you did for both of us little
brother I was alone like
you Believe me I suffered
immensely

Clint moves around the table towards his brother who
continues sitting Runs his hand the short end of the
table Inspects the peaceful face of the unconscious
waitress

MALE VOICEKEVIN
We are together again
finally Like a family

Clint calmly walks right up to Kevin Standing within
arms reach now

CLINT
I dont want to do this Kev

Clint turns to look at his brother They are now face
to face except Clint standing over his older brother

MALE VOICEKEVIN
You cant change it little
brother Youre a convicted
killer

CLINT
It wasnt me

MALE VOICEKEVIN
Its in your blood Same as
mine Instinct versus will
Instinct wins every time I
love you Clint You are
everything to me

They stare at each other a moment The swaying overhead
light behind them The outline of the girls body
beneath it

CLINT
I dont want to do this Kev

Kevins demeanor changes in an instant Possessed by an
unseen evil

MALE VOICEKEVIN
You gonna fucking cry again

Without emotion Clint swings the crowbar hitting
Kevin in the side of the head instantly splitting his
skull spilling blood

Kevin falls to the ground With a contained fury Clint
hits Kevins body multiple times Blood splatters his
face with each THUD

The swinging stops as suddenly as it began Clint just
stands there Stares at Kevin unmoving

BLACK SCREEN

MALE VOICE (VO)
You cant just forget about
it

(beat)
MALE VOICE (VO)

It is there forever It was
there when you were born

MALE VOICE (VO)
Before you were born

THE END
