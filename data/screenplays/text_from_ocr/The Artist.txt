THE ARTIST

Written by

Michel Hazanavicius

Silent film illustrated musically with some title cards to
indicate the dialogues with actors whose lips move when they
speak although we never hear their voices The images are in
black and white in format 133

TITLES

The letters of the titles come up on a title card typical of
the 1920s Elegant motifs around the edge of the frame and
in the background there are geometrical shapes reminiscent

of the light beams of a film premiére Behind is a stylized

town The titles end in a fade to black On black the date

appears on the screen 1927

INT LABORATORY - DAY

In a futuristic 1920s laboratory a man in tail coat and
bow tie is being tortured Ultrasound is being piped into his
ears Its incredibly painful Hes screaming

Title card
Im not telling I wont talk

His torturers cold men of science in white coats gradually
increase the volume The pain seems unbearable the volume
reaches level 10 (maximum) the man passes out

INT CELLS and CORRIDORS - DAY

Guards wearing long leather overcoats throw the man into a
cell

As the man is lying there on the ground a dog wiggles
through the bars at the window The dog a Jack Russell
jumps on top of the man - visibly his master - and begins to
lick his face The man opens one eye When he sees his dog
he cant help cracking a smile

The man now on his feet looks in pain Despite the pain he
motions to his dog who begins to bark in lively fashion

Outside the cell the guard looks curious about the noise He
goes to the door opens the spy flap and finds himself face
to face with the man eye to eye just a couple of inches
apart The man moves his eyes in such a way that he
hypnotizes the guard Superimposed on the screen a spinning
black and white spiral until the dazed guard take his keys
opens the door and releases the man and his dog

The man (the hero thus) imprisons the guard without harming
him then runs over to the guards desk His ears are still
causing him pain but he opens a drawer and takes out his
belongings a top hat which he snaps open and a mask which
he puts over his head to conceal his eyes

We catch up with the masked man walking down corridors He
suddenly stops copied by his dog who follows him like his
shadow The man on his guard has spotted another guard
where two corridors meet

With a look he orders his dog to move forwards into the
guards line of sight The guard looks over at the animal
Using his fingers the hero pretends to shoot his dog The
dog collapses plays dead The guard increasingly curious
gets to his feet He slowly approaches the motionless dog
When he comes close he is attacked from the side by the hero
who quickly puts him out of action with a mere punch

The masked man then rushes to another cell and releases a
young female prisoner She too is wearing evening dress As
she is thanking him he staggers and clutches his ears in
pain Shes concerned

Title card
Can I help you in some way

He refuses

Title card
No I dont get helped I give the help around here

He composes himself She casts him an admiring glance Then

in view of the urgency of their situation they escape at a
run

his gun and goes out onto the air field only to find the

EXT AIRPLANE - NIGHT

A little later in the night still at the controls the man is
fighting not to fall asleep Behind him the women is sleeping
the dog is lying in her arms Suddenly she is awoken by
explosions happening close by Pandemonium The man doesnt
understand it either he tries to pick up altitude but quickly
notices that the explosions are in fact pretty and

inoffensive He consults a calendar dial on the control panel
that shows it is July 14th immediately understands and

bursts into laughter

Title card Weve arrived welcome to France

As the music picks up the tune of The Marseillaise the
airplane flies away through the exploding fireworks

The words The End appear on the screen

INT WINGS MOVIE THEATER LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

From the moment they parked the car onwards we become
absorbed by whats happening around the screening of end of
this film

Behind the screen weve seen the actor who plays the hero -
his name is George Valentin - closely studying the reactions
of the audience He was standing close to his dog motioning
to it not to make a noise The dogs name is Jack

In the same area weve also seen the lead actress Her name
is Constance Gray She too looks tense and is latched onto
the arm of a pleasant-looking man who is chewing anxiously on
a cigar The man looks rich but a little weak Hes surely
the producer

INT MOVIE THEATER LOS ANGELES - NIGHT 10

In the house much of the audience is open-mouthed excited
immobile and often wide-eyed

In the pit a symphony orchestra plays to accompany the film Now that the film is ending and the last note is
sounding the cast anxiously awaits the audiences verdict
which after two or three seconds of silence bursts into
thunderous applause to the great joy of the actor and the
people around him especially the actress and the producer
who kiss each other on the lips

Two theater hands bring down the curtain The lights come on George Valentin comes onto the stage
and acknowledges the audience they are cheering for him He
is so happy he dances a few tap steps to express his joy then
he acknowledges the orchestra before finally motioning to
someone in the wings to join him Jack the dog trots over in
response The crowd laughs and cheers George waves to the
dog Jack waves back then waves at the audience the people
are loving it

In the wings Constance is fuming with rage but on stage
George is pretending with his fingers to pull at the dog who
fakes death Thunderous applause again

Behind the actress the producer cant hold back a smile and
this enrages the actress still more

Suddenly George hamming it up remembers something hed
forgotten and asks someone from the other side of the wings
to join him Its Constance She comes over smiling to the
audience and says something to George with a smile

Title card Ill get you for that

She waves but we can tell that her smile is set between her
teeth She isnt feeling comfortable George motions firing a
gun with his fingers but she does not fall down merely
casts him a very funny glance George looks at his fingers
not understanding why they dont work anymore then mimes
throwing them away behind him as though theyve become
useless Constance stalks back off into the wings in
annoyance but the audience is ecstatic Once in the wings
the actress sticks up her middle finger at George and
exaggeratedly mouths so he can read her lips Put this up
your ass George grinning broadly responds by clapping his
hands in applause then leaves the stage executing a few
more dance steps as he does so The audience is delighted

As he comes off stage George gets soundly told off by
Constance but still grinning he motions towards the
audience who are still asking for more The producer
although delighted by the successful reception makes a weak
attempt to calm the actress down As for George he returns
to the stage the audience roars He pretends to want to
leave the stage and mimes bumping into an invisible wall
just as hes leaving the stage George holds his nose the

audience goes wild Constance gets even madder and while
George carries on clowning about the producer too breaks

into a beaming smile Hes probably realized that George has
the audience on his side Constance furious storms off She
is followed by the producer who is trying to placate her
although it looks like hes got his work cut out for him

EXT MOVIE THEATER LOS ANGELES - NIGHT 11

Outside we are in front of a typically American movie theater
decked out with all the accessories of a grand premiére The

entrance is lit up there are crowds gathered on the sidewalk
cops are guarding the red carpet with a cordon of bodies etc

George comes out causing the crowds mainly young women to
press forwards - and the photographers flashes to spark into
life The cops are struggling to maintain control of the
situation as George poses for the photographers and waves at
his many fans

In the crowd a young woman right at the front is staring at
him in rapture She drops her bag and as she bends to pick it
up a swell in the crowd pushes her underneath the arms of the
policeman in front of her out of the crowd and into George
She stares at him more in love than ever delighted to be
there The police wait for someone to give orders George
doesnt quite know what to do Nobody moves The young woman
finally bursts out laughing which after a moment of shock
causes George to laugh too thus placating the cops and tacitly
signaling to the photographers that they can take pictures of
the scene The flashes seem to lend the woman self-confidence
who in a very carefree manner begins to clown about in front
of them George is delighted at the sight by the whole scene
and realizing this the young woman steals a kiss Flash The
image becomes static then dissolves into the printed picture
on the front page of The Hollywood Reporter newspaper along
with three other pictures of the scene and the headline WHOS
THAT GIRL

INT GEORGE and DORIS HOUSE - DAY 12

The very same newspaper is being read by an elegant woman
sitting at a sumptuous breakfast table We are in the large
dining room of an ultra-luxurious Hollywood villa All around
her are magnificent furniture superb paintings and objets
dart including a beautiful trio of monkeys one hiding its
eyes one with hands clasped to its ears and the third
obscuring its mouth George comes into the room and kisses

his wife She responds with cold indifference You could cut
the atmosphere with a knife The woman hands George the
newspaper He knows whats up but tries to laugh it off She
doesnt find it funny is as cold as stone and barely looks
at him She is obviously extremely annoyed with him George
picks up his dog and puts it on the table Jack drops his
head to one side and his big eyes implore seem to implore her
forgiveness Its the exact expression of someone asking to
be loved but Doris is implacable She gets up walks away
and does not turn back Left on his own George has a closed
expression on his face He seems unhappy to have hurt his
wifes feelings Then he realizes that Jack is on the table
in a ridiculous pose and signals to him to get down The dog
obeys George looks at the paper the cause of his problems

EXT HOLLYWOOD STREET BUS - DAY 13
Thirteen white letters placed on a hillside
HOLLYWOODLAND

Below in town a bus

INT BUS (DRIVING) HOLLYWOOD - DAY 14

Inside the full bus is the young woman from the day before Her
name is Peppy Miller She is proudly holding The Hollywood
Reporter with her face on the front page and is more or less
discreetly making suggestive glances hoping that someone
recognizes her But the people around her - from working and
middle class backgrounds - are visibly on their way to work and
remain impervious to her game

She - carefully - puts the paper away in her bag in which four
or five copies of the newspaper are already carefully tucked
away then gets off the bus at the next stop

EXT KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DAY 15

She goes through the main gates of Kinograph Studios and
heads towards where they hire extras

In a courtyard fifty-odd people are waiting some sitting on
wooden crates others standing There are mums with kids
guys with animals men dressed as cowboys etc Peppy is
among them sitting next to a man of about sixty who is
dressed in a highly stylized fashion His job is obviously
that of a butler Peppy proudly shows him the picture in the
16A

newspaper The man leans to take a closer look unfolds the
newspaper sees the headline smiles and then folds it back
up again and returns it to Peppy text-side-up highlighting
the headline Whos that girl

Peppy is a bit annoyed to have been put in her place but
deep down she knows hes right Nobody knows who she is She
puts the newspaper away

A man who visibly works for the studio some assistant or
other comes into the courtyard climbs on a crate and makes
an announcement

Title card Contemporary film Five girls who can dance

All the men who had pressed forwards turn on their heels
leaving the assistant surrounded only by women The man says
something to one girl who begins to dance He motions to her
that its ok and she heads off towards the wardrobe section
He does the same with a second girl and she gets hired too
Then its Peppys turn She puts a lot of energy into a few
top class tap steps impressing the guy to such an extent
that he smiles admiringly then signals that shes hired

Full of self-assurance that her lucky day has come Peppy
heads off towards wardrobe too swinging her hips as she
pauses in front of the butler

Title card The name is Miller Peppy Miller
She finishes with an exaggerated wink before walking on
leaving behind the impassive butler
INT GEORGE and DORIS HOUSE - DAY 16A

In the lobby George is preparing to leave the house He
waves at the huge full-length portrait of himself waving and
smiling whilst wearing a tuxedo He looks great in the
painting and George is delighted to see and to wave to
himself

EXT KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DAY 16

Later George in a luxurious car driven by his chauffeur
arrives at the Kinograph studios with his dog The guard at the
entrance smiles broadly at them and waves
17 INT KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DRESSING ROOM CORRIDORS - DAY 17

As he walks towards his dressing room everyone smiles at him
Hes not always fooled by these signs of respect and apes a
few smiles himself

18 INT KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - GEORGES DRESSING ROOM - DAY 18

In his dressing room wearing a tailcoat and top hat George
is finishing putting his make up on He has a white face and
dark lips and eyes His chauffeur is signing autographs for
him on full length photographs of himself (George) with his
dog George says to him

Title card Go and buy a piece of jewelry for my wife A nice
piece to make it up to her

The chauffeur nods Having finished his mask up George
picks up a photo looks at it closely and then writes on it
As he leaves the dressing room we see the photograph Hes
written Woof Woof on it and signed it with the paw print of
a dog

19 INT KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - RESTAURANT DECOR SET - DAY 19

Were on a film set the crew is setting up a shot The
director is unhappy with a screen positioned behind a bay

window and he sends it off

Title card Remove that screen and bring me another one On
the double

Two hands pick up the screen and carry it away George
arrives on set everyone smiles at him He sits down on the
chair which bears his name The producer whom we saw the
previous day at the premiére arrives His name is Zimmer and
hes flanked by - and followed around at every moment by -
two secretaries and two assistants One of them hands him The
Hollywood Reporter and Zimmer before hes even come to a
halt talks to George as he shows him the front page He is
visibly upset George looks a lot more relaxed he says hello
and vaguely tries to reassure him But Zimmer persists still
pointing at the newspaper

Title card Because of this childish nonsense theres
nothing about the film before page 5

Behind George the two set hands come back with a new screen
of sky scenery and wait standing just next to George As
they are holding it there is a three foot gap underneath
While the producer is talking to him Georges attention is
drawn by a lovely pair of womens legs that have come to
stand behind the screen the top half of the body being
hidden by it George acknowledges the sight with a smile and
is about to bring his attention back to the on-going
discussion when his attention is drawn away again by a
noise that of the tap steps the female legs are making
presumably as a warm up George smiles in recognition and
responds with a few tap steps of his own The womens legs
instantly stop seem to think a moment and then answer back
but with a jump in the complexity of the steps A tap
dialogue ensues between the two pairs of legs until the set
hands - the path before them now cleared - pick up their
screen of scenery and walk off with it The screen moves away
and as it disappears reveals that the upper body belongs to a
young woman She pulls a face meaning Here I am And of
course its Peppy except that she immediately realizes who
she is dealing with - visibly she wasnt expecting this at
all - and feels completely ridiculous and uncomfortable

Her joyful expression gradually becomes one of abject
apology but George is roaring with laughter

After a short pause Zimmer makes the connection He checks
the front page of the paper and recognizes her

Then he begins shouting at her and all she can do is lower
her head unable to reply He gestures that shes fired and
for her to get out and she starts to go completely
distraught Shes just made a couple of steps when George
stops her and tells her to come back Everyone is surprised
most of all him Zimmer cant believe it and so doesnt
respond at first

Theres bad feeling between them as though neither wanted

this sudden conflict but like it had always been there

tangible Everyone on the set seems to be waiting for Zimmer

to react but to their surprise after a long moment of

hesitation he walks away without saying a thing Peppy looks
at George gratefully smiling but seems a little preoccupied

as though she might have made a mistake

Everyone on set gets back to work

20 INT KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - RESTAURANT DECOR SET - DAY

Theyre about to start shooting The director is showing

George what he has to do The scene is happening in a cabaret
restaurant George has to cross a dance floor but each time he
is stopped by a guy ringing a bell to signal it is time to
change dancing partner George finds himself dancing with

Peppy one moment and in the arms of a very fat man the next
the director finds the gag hysterical The scene is shot
several times from three different angles Each time George
dances with Peppy and each time the nature of their rapport
changes To begin with they are happy and laughing but then
with time less so Then they become embarrassed and then
things get worse We start the sequence again and again to the
sound of the clapperboard counting the number of takes but the
eroticism between them is the only thing that stands out from
the scene every thing else goes unnoticed Ultimately no
flirting or suggestiveness has gone on just the very obvious
beginning of feelings between them that they find disturbing
Its probably love

INT KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DRESSING ROOM CORRIDORS - DAY 21

Later on in the dressing room corridor Peppy holding an
envelope goes up to Georges door She knocks waits for a
reply then enters Theres nobody there She hesitates not
sure whether to leave or stay

INT KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - GEORGES DRESSING ROOM - DAY 22

Finally she goes into the room and places the envelope
addressed to George Valentin on the dresser Then she
attentively looks around the dressing room She looks at the
objects and photos and notices hanging from a coat stand
Georges jacket on a hanger and his hat which sits on a hook
above it The way the clothes are disposed looks like Georges
silhouette except that the clothes are empty She goes over
strokes the jacket and little by little brings George to life
through his clothes

She puts her right hand into the sleeve and touches her own
waist As its Georges sleeve she makes it look like his arm
has come to life as though George has come to life Even more
so since her left hand is stroking the jacket as though George
were inside She takes pleasure from the embrace and when
George comes into the room she slowly removes her hand without
any rush George sees her they look at each other He closes
the door but doesnt go over to her instead going over to the
mirror He looks at her she at him He motions to her to
approach She does He stares at her face for a while before he
speaks

Title card If you want to be an actress you need to have
something no one else has

He takes a make-up pencil and draws a beauty spot above her
upper lip She looks at herself in the mirror and smiles She
likes it She turns towards him and quite naturally folds
into his arms The dog watches them curiously with its head
leaning to one side They are probably about to kiss when
Georges chauffeur comes into the room and catches them
George swiftly moves aside and there is a moment of
discomfort The chauffeur unwraps a parcel and takes out a
large and beautiful pearl necklace George is intrigued by
the necklace and turns away from Peppy She understands that
George has his own life that their embrace was just a stolen
moment and slowly leaves looking back at George as she does
so He does not look at her She leaves the room Once he has
studied and necklace and is satisfied George turns back
towards Peppy but she is no longer there The chauffeur exits
the room

When he is alone George looks at himself in the mirror His
expression shows that he things he is the stupidest man in
the world He mimes shooting himself in the temple with his
fingers but its the dog which collapses into its play-dead
pose

INT GEORGE and DORIS HOUSE - DAY 23

The next morning hes having breakfast with his wife The
atmosphere is still dreadful but this time hes not making any
effort either He disdainfully watches Doris eat She is
cutting up strawberries using a knife and fork George watches
her smiles and continues to watch Except its not Doris hes
watching Instead its Peppy whos tucking into her food and
talking and laughing vivaciously George is with her with an
expression of love on his face Hes laughing with her when
suddenly reality bites Hes still sitting opposite Doris
and shes staring at him because she doesnt understand why he
is laughing She visibly finds him ridiculous He stops
laughing and breakfast carries on as normal

INT GEORGE and DORIS HOUSE - DAY 24

middle-ages thugs in a tavern He kills two of them but
unfortunately loses his epee when fighting the third But when
the third man attacks George merely dodges with a sleight of
body and puts his attacker out of action with a right hook
Calm restored he smiles and waves in brotherly fashion to a
mysterious man who is trying to hide underneath his long cape
The man stands up throws aside his cape and reveals himself to
be Napoleon He puts his bicorne hat back on and warmly
thanks an astonished George Napoleon says something to him
and George respectfully bows walks away from him still bowing
then turns and runs Once out of the decor he bumps right into
a worried-looking Zimmer who is followed by his loyal
assistants George is in a playful mood Zimmer tells him

Title Card I want to show you something Right now

George seems astonished that Zimmer is leaving the set and
not filming but agrees Napoleon walks past them very
imperially and gestures royally to a technician to bring him
a chair The technician doesnt miss the chance to remind the
man that he is only an extra and not Napoleon

INT SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY

The screening begins

INT VOICE TEST STUDIO - DAY

On screen we see a card that indicates its a sound shooting

tests it delighted to be there Cut We see her again the
microphone has disappeared and she acts out a scene Its a
monologue Her acting is terrible very theatrical but the
audience can hear her It is however awful In the screening room the audience seems stunned by
what they seehear They are fascinated They then begin to
congratulate each other and slap Zimmer on the back Zimmers
pride seems to grow by the second

George who at first seemed very surprised slowly begins a

snigger which gradually has become a belly laugh when the
actress earnestly ends her monologue

When the lights come up George is laughing uncontrollably
way beyond the bounds of mere mockery as his sincerity is
obvious The people present are embarrassed and Zimmer is
deeply put out George still laughing leaves the room
waving an apology with his hands as he goes but also
pointing to the screen to explain why hes laughing Zimmer
feels even more humiliated Fade to black on his face

INT KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - GEORGES DRESSING ROOM - DAY 33

from within the film itself One second later George realizes
that the object made a noise He moves it again the object
makes a noise again George is worried He tries another object
and obtains noise again His dog barks and we hear it He gets
up (chair makes a noise) and says something to his dog but no
sound comes out of his mouth when he speaks He realizes

Outside in the deserted courtyard a feather eddies towards

the ground carried by the breeze George is watching it drift
to the ground when suddenly a gust of wind sends it soaring
back into the sky George follows it with his eyes and notices
a man crossing between two sets He looks like some kind of set
hand or assistant a working man in any case George calls to
him The two men draw close and George asks him whats
happening The man takes the days newspaper out of his pocket

and hands it to George before walking off George reads

storms into Zimmers office

INT KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - ZIMMERS OFFICE - DAY 43

Zimmer is in a meeting with some men They are probably
engineers in view of the attention being given to the plans
lying on the desk Everyone is surprised by Georges rude
entry The engineers seem embarrassed but Zimmer smiles and
politely asks them to leave as though asking for their
understanding As they head for the door some of them drop
their heads so as not to meet Georges eyes whereas others
look him right between the eyes but without any love lost This
exchange causes a strange unpleasant feeling within him He
seems embarrassed Its perhaps due to the rudeness of his
eruption into the office but its more likely due to the looks
hes been given For the first time for ages he has not been
looked at how a star is normally looked at - with respect
desire and admiration - but like any ordinary man is looked at
or worse still how a superfluous man is looked at

As George realizes that his status has just changed Zimmer
invites him to sit down Then speaks to him in a friendly
manner

Title card We belong to another age you and I George
Nowadays the world talks

He talks to him looks a little embarrassed while George
takes it on the chin not knowing how to respond

Title card People want to see new faces Talking faces

George reaches deep down into himself and makes an effort to
bring up a smile

Title card Paramount will be delighted They still want me

Zimmer responds with a pursing of the lips that is more

damning than any counter argument could be As though hes
telling George he can always give it a go George understands
whats happening Zimmer is sorry

Title card Im sorry The public wants fresh blood And the
public is never wrong

George gets to his feet

Title card Its me the people want and its my films they
want to see And Im going to give them to them

Zimmer nods with another pursing of the lips as though he
cant wait to see that George seems very sure of himself

Title card I dont need you Go make your talking movies
Im going to make them a beautiful film

As George leaves in disgust his eyes are drawn to an
advertising feature representing the new faces of Kinograph
Studios Among the medallion framed young portraits George
recognizes that of Peppy Miller He glances up at Zimmer

Title card Fresh blood

The two men exchange a last glance then George exits

INT KINOGRAPH STUDIOS SECRETARYS OFFICE - DAY 44

meets the gaze of the engineers waiting in the secretarys
antechamber he puffs up his chest and walks tall out of the
office

INT KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - STAIRS - DAY 45

Going down the stairs from the offices he passes a laughing
Peppy who is accompanied by two young and charming men perfect

above of him She has a beaming smile and is truly delighted to
see him He is delighted too although his mood is very
different

Title card (him) How are you

Title card (her) Fantastic Ive been given a lead role

He nods we see in his eyes that hes terribly happy for her
They look at each other she laughs

Then she fumbles in her bag for something with which to note
down her telephone number on a piece of paper It takes a
while and is a little chaotic she apologizes but he visibly
takes a lot of pleasure out of watching her She finally gets
the number down and hands it to him telling him to call her -
to really call her In response he casts a glance over to the
young men waiting for her higher up the stairs and she

She looks at him flirtatiously Then she gestures again for
him to call her and he nods even though we think that he
probably will not do so She leaves and he watches her go
before beginning his decent once more Once at the top she
turns back to call out to George he too has turned to look
She smiles at him breaks into a few tap steps for old times
sake then blows him a kiss

He catches the kiss with a smile pretends to make it
disappear in his other hand like a magician then shows her
the inside breast pocket of his jacket as proof that hes
keeping it safe and warm She laughs loudly and goes on her
way He watches her walk away with admiration in his eyes
She vanishes and Georges smile takes on a note of
melancholy and then he leaves too

board that shows hes both the films producer and director
The film is called Tears of love and it tells the tale of an
English adventurer - played by himself - accompanied by a young
woman an old man who looks like a professor and who is
probably the father of the young woman and lastly an African
tribe represented as savages and whose humanity remains to be

proven

We see George in the various stages of preparation writing re-
writing directing acting signing a lot of checks but also
leaving very early in the morning to set up shots with his
collaborators etc He looks fulfilled like he truly believes
in what hes doing despite the tiredness hes feeling His dog
has a role in the film too doing tricks George looks very
happy very committed He takes a supple branch feeds it
through the sleeves of a womans blouse and by holding the two
ends of the branch out in front of him dances with the
imaginary woman Everyone around him is happy and laughing
Hes not shooting a comedy however its obviously a drama of
some sort from what we see of the set and the way the actors
play their role

Then appear on screen the mock ups of posters they are shown
on the set to George

He chooses the one in which he is most prominent its a poster

depicting a cutesy melodrama and bears the release date

His position and demeanor are exactly like when he was watching
the screening of Tears of Love from the back of the room with
the verdict of failure in the air

Hes looking a little unsteady on his feet probably due to the
hip flask hes necking that seems to contain liquor The
objects go under the hammer one by one We see the three
monkeys go by notably hear no evil speak no evil see no
evil Two buyers especially are raising the prices by bidding
against each other a distinguished and reserved-looking man
and a lady of a certain age who looks a bit severe to the
point of bigotry They dont seem perfectly comfortable but

INT GEORGES HOUSE - DAY 91

The Zorro sequence is being screened on a wall in Georges
apartment George is watching himself slumped in an easy
chair His sluggish attitude and listless air are in sharp
contrast with the image of himself projected by the film

Then the image jumps and goes white George gets up still half-
smashed His shadow is clearly delineated on the white screen

He sees it looks it up and down and then starts to look at it
sideways

Title card Look what youve become
He carries on shouting at it obviously very annoyed with it
Title card You were very nasty And stupid And arrogant

He doesnt even want to look at it anymore He looks
disgusted Suddenly his shadow separates itself from him and
moves independently from him As he shouts at it it lowers
its head and doesnt reply

He carries on as though its normal until his shadow walks
off with its head bowed He watches it go trying to
understand whats happening but its gone and hes still
there He begins to holler

Totally smashed he starts to violently throw film reels
against the wall as he hollers The cans split open and the
film bursts out all over George is becoming more and more
frenzied The floor is now covered in cans and film He
stops dripping with sweat Worriedly he looks around for a
moment Then he strikes a match takes a second to consider
what hes about to do and throws the match into the middle of
the reels

Theres madness in his eyes as he watches the fire take hold
We can see his pleasure at seeing the flames spread But hes
very quickly overrun The reels burst into flames in an
instant and give off lots of smoke Jack is panicking and
barks incessantly Suddenly George seems to lose it He
doesnt know what to do anymore and although the fire is
spreading quite spectacularly around him he runs to where
the reels and films that he has not opened are and begins
throwing them frantically over his shoulder as though hes
looking for one in particular The ever-increasing denseness
of the smoke however is making the task almost impossible
On the floor below the smoke Jack flees the room and runs
off while George suffocates but continues to struggle with
the cans of reels

EXT GEORGES HOUSE - DAY 92

is getting ever lower and is slowly covering his face Jack barks louder and louder The policeman feels
uncomfortable A woman is watching the scene inquisitively
Not knowing what to do the cop motions to the dog to be
silent and threatens it with two fingers just like George
miming a pistol Jack collapses and plays dead The cop has
no idea whats happened he crouches down and touches the dog
to see if its all right Jack wakes up and goes to leave but
stops immediately to show the cop he wants to take him with
him The cop still doesnt understand its the woman who
tells him what he must do The cop seems to understand has a
moment of doubt and then starts following the dog Jack
encourages him to go faster but the cop resists to begin
with Little by little though as though realizing the

of the film in front of the window We see random photograms
run by Its the only sequence they ever shot together years

room Peppy is close on her heels She comes into the room in
her nightgown When he sees her George smiles and she rushes
over to the bed and puts her arms tight around him She is
terribly moved but when she releases him from her arms to talk

looks at her watch and realizes she needs to hurry

Title card Ive got to go I have to be on set for nine
oclock

George smiles kindly at her She returns the smile but we can
tell that maybe reality has just reminded them that she is
working and he is not They exchange a last glance before
she leaves the room

George now alone gets up with some difficulty He picks up
a pile of folded clothes from an armchair Its his jacket
and pants both half burned On the floor his shoes are in

the strange pervading atmosphere His curiosity is spurred by
a convoluted object that is covered in a thin cloth A ray of
light surges into the room The door has opened and standing
against the daylight is a maid

the set we saw the previous day and Peppy seems to be trying
to convince Zimmer of something She seems to be describing a
film poster or the facade of a movie theater shed love to see
He doesnt seem too enthusiastic from the looks of the negative
shakes of his head and his apologetic air as he listens to
Peppy She finally stops talking and gives him a determined
look Zimmer uncomfortable and sorry calmly replies

Title card George is a silent movie actor He belongs to the
past Today hes a nobody

As Zimmers speaking she removes her accessories and hat
Zimmer is so intrigued he stops talking

visibly isnt sure hes understood properly She drives her
point home

Zimmer still isnt sure hes understood He just looks at
her

Title card Im blackmailing you get it

Even when shes blackmailing shes still pretty and Zimmer
looks at her totally at a loss but at the same time its
obvious that hes going to back down The people around them
are listening in on their conversation and seem to be waiting
for his decision Theres an element of déja-vu to the
situation and Zimmer who already backed down a few years
before gives in

Title card And why not
She smiles at him picks up the screenplay with delight and

leaves As he moves away she whistles at him He turns round
and she vigorously blows him a kiss

INT PEPPYS CAR (DRIVING) - DAY 108

The screenplay lies on the front seat of a car The camera
pulls back its Clifton who is in the driving seat

INT PEPPYS HOUSE - GEORGES BEDROOM - DAY 109

George is lying in bed when his former chauffeur comes in At
first hes delighted to see him but this turns into
astonishment and he seems to ask the man a question The
chauffeur answers

Title card I work for Miss Miller now

George visibly doesnt know what to think and although he
remains pleasant becomes somewhat reserved Its as though
something has come between them The chauffeur places the
screenplay on the bedside table George seems to greet it
with mistrust certainly not with enthusiasm

The chauffeur also has a box of cakes with him that he puts
on a plate for George George doesnt want any its all too
much

Before he leaves the chauffeur overcomes his habitual
reserve for the first time and says to George

Title card Shes been good to you Shes always looked out
for you

The chauffeur leaves without trying to convince George
further as the other looks on full of pride and doubt

EXT PEPPYS HOUSE - DAY 110
From the window we see the chauffeur get into the car and
drive off We recognize the car as being the one that belonged
to George At the window George watches him leave Then he seems
to have an idea or more exactly an intuition

INT PEPPYS HOUSE - STOREROOM - DAY 111
George goes into the room thats full of sheets He goes

straight over to the object with the bizarre shape and lifts up
the sheet Underneath he finds his former objet dart the

three monkeys hear no evil speak no evil and see no
evil He thinks for a moment then pulls of another sheet to
reveal a piece of furniture Once again its a piece that used
to belong to him and we recognize it from having seen it at the
auction room

After taking off several other sheets George realizes that

she bought everything he had put up for sale furniture
paintings objets dart souvenirs etc He rips off sheets

one after the other and the objects appear even down to his
suits and tuxedos He continues and discovers the painting
depicting him in a tux waving and smiling George looks
stunned at the sight of himself looking so full of life Hes
interrupted by the same ray of light which surges into the room
once more This time at the door are the butler and the maid

George walks towards them when he sees them The closer he gets
to them however the more his expression tightens We realize
that the butler is none other than the distinguished-looking
man who purchased everything at the auction and that the maid
is the woman who was bidding against him to raise the sale
prices George is looking at them as he leaves the room He has
recognized them but doesnt say anything to them He walks
off still shocked by what hes just realized

INT PEPPYS HOUSE - GEORGES BEDROOM - DAY 112

EXT BEGGAR STREET - DAY 114

George is in the street wearing his burnt suit and damaged
shoes He is shirtless With Jack by his side he walks along
the sidewalk There are a few other people walking along About
twenty yards ahead of him a man is begging He holds out his
hand to passers-by George approaches and when there are no
other passers-by between him and George the beggar glances at
him and lowers his hand He doesnt raise it as George
approaches George stops in front of him and looks at him but
the beggar motions to him to scram George continues on his
way For that moment at least he has become one of them

He buttons up the collar of his suit in an attempt to hide the
fact that he doesnt have a shirt then heads off and loses

himself in the crowd Some distance later he stops to check
his reflection in a shop window The image he sees is that of a
bum Its even more striking because the in the window there is
a young male mannequin wearing a tux top hat and white scarf
The image of the mannequin and that of George are superimposed

A cop comes up to George and begins talking to him ina
friendly manner He speaks but we dont know what about There
is not Title card George visibly has no idea what the cop is
talking about The cop seems to be talking about nothing
important just chatting He talks and talks George
doesnt understand what hes saying and doesnt understand
why hes talking to him Hes lost

Title card What did you say

The cop smiles carries on talking then stops He thinks
hes talking to a madman He doesnt persist merely sizes
George up and once hes decided that hes harmless the cop
walks off George totally bewildered by the incident seems
to lose his grip on himself a little more

INT PEPPYS HOUSE - DAY 115

Peppy gets home in the evening arms laden with flowers Shes
happy

She quickly goes up the stairs and into Georges bedroom Hes

that he has left She drops the flowers

INT GEORGES BURNT HOUSE - DAY 116

George goes into his house that has been disfigured by the
fire The flames have changed everything and the atmosphere
here again seems ghostly and sad

George sits down in an armchair in the darkness Jack sits down
facing him He wags his tail and it thumps on the ground

INT PEPPYS HOUSE - STOREROOM - DAY 117

In the room with all the sheets Peppy is with the maid The
maid seems to be telling her what happened with George how he
removed all the sheets etc Peppy listens with an inscrutable
expression on her face Then suddenly overcome by a terrible
thought she rushes outside

EXT PEPPYS HOUSE - DAY 118

She runs out of the house and over to the car but the
chauffeur isnt there She honks the horn to call him but
theres no response She honks the horn again then not
wanting to wait any longer and seeing the keys on the
dashboard she gets behind the wheel starts the engine and
pulls off in a series of kangaroo hops Its obvious that she
doesnt know how to drive all that well but still goes at full
speed - more or less successfully Just as she passes through
the gate the chauffeur turns up Too late He sees her drive
away

EXT PEPPYS CAR (DRIVING) - DAY 119

Peppy is driving as fast as she can through town but shes
pretty reckless and almost causes an accident

INT GEORGES BURNT HOUSE - DAY 120

Outside Georges house the wind is slamming one of the
shutters with the regularity of a metronome George takes a
gulp of liquor then puts down the glass opens a cardboard box
and takes out a pistol that he places on the table in front of
him He picks up the glass for another gulp Jack doesnt like
what he sees He barks As for Peppy shes speeding along totally ignoring
even the most basic of road safety requirements George puts down his glass and picks up the pistol
Jack isnt happy at all He barks and bites Georges trouser

leg pulling on it Peppy speeding along George puts the pistol into his mouth Jack is barking
like mad George still in the same position closes his
eyes

Title card BANG

George is in the same position He still has the pistol in
his mouth Visibly hes heard a BANG from outside because
he takes the pistol out of his mouth and looks out the
window

EXT GEORGES BURNT HOUSE - DAY 121

Outside we see Peppys car has rammed into the gate and is
still shuddering Peppy didnt brake in time but she doesnt
care She jumps out the car and runs into the house

INT GEORGES BURNT HOUSE - DAY 122

She rushes into the living room and stops for a moment to look
at George George awkwardly tries to hide the pistol behind
him She bursts into tears

Title card I feel so awful I only wanted to help you To
take care of you

He seems to reply that no its not her fault shes got
nothing to feel bad about He opens his arms towards her
still holding the pistol and the gun fires itself
Fortunately no one is hurt but the incident makes Peppy
laugh and between sobs and gasps of laughter she throws
herself into Georges arms They hug for a long time Peppy
says into his ear

fq

Title card Youve got so much that no one else has

And into her ear George replies

fq

Title card No Im nothing but a shadow No good for
anything but silence

Peppy doesnt reply She just holds him tighter still and
closes her eyes Jack is sitting close by watching them and
wagging his tail

Outside the shutter is still slamming and the car is still
shuddering Peppy opens her eyes Visibly shes had an idea

Jack wags his tail and thumps it on the ground The shutter
slams The car shudders Peppy smiles at George

Title card I know what you have that no one else does
Peppy moves away from George and motions to him to listen
The shutter slams Jacks tail thumps The car shudders Peppy

does a few tap steps George doesnt understand

Peppy starts again with a beaming smile waiting for his

response George does a few tap steps himself basic ones
without any great enthusiasm She smiles at him and does a
few more complex steps that are a lot livelier He smiles
back finally understanding the golden gift that he has in his
feet He looks at Peppy lovingly with a beaming smile on his
face

INT KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - ZIMMERS OFFICE - DAY 123

Music suddenly begins to play and we see feet dancing in
another decor Except that from now on we actually hear the
sound of the tap steps We pull back to find Peppy and George
in Zimmers office Theyre dancing for him Little by little
Zimmer is convinced by them and when they finish their
demonstration he has a broad smile on his face

INT STUDIO - PEPPY and GEORGE - DAY 124

We find Peppy and George on a film set still dancing The
piece of jazz they are dancing to has gone so crazy that now
everyone wants to get up and dance They are dancing a tap
number facing the camera in a décor representing a stylized
New York The choreography is incredible in the grand style
of the old Hollywood musicals and they finish with a knee
slide that brings them right up to us with big smiles on
their faces The music stops on a powerful blast from the
brass instruments that leaves everyone bursting with energy
In the ensuing silence Peppy and George stay exactly where
they were facing the camera with the smile stuck on their
faces It goes on for a little too long they are out of
breath

Then they look at someone off-shot They are facing a film
crew (from their era of course) The director smiles Zimmer
sitting next to him seems ecstatic The director speaks and
we hear what he says
