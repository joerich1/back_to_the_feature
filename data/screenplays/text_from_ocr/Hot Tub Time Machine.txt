Hot Tub Time Machine Theme
Lyrics by Josh Heald
Music by Def Leppard Styx Journey Poison or Whitesnake

Water cranked to a hundred and three

Got my tunes my snacks my booze my skis

(Got the) freshest moves you ever seen

When Im soakin in my Hot Tub Time Machine

When youre going back to the 80s

And you might be fuckin some ladies

You bring your button fly jeans and some sweet hair gel
Want blow All you gotta do is yell

(Yeah youre) lookin real smooth (and youre) lookin real

When youre soakin in your Hot Tub Time Machine
Yeah
Hot Tub - Time Machine
Hot Tub - Time Machine
Cmon
(Sweet guitar solo - 16 measures
Relaxed as hell when youre goin through time
Thats the 54 jets workin on your spine
(Yeah) you gotta be loose and you gotta be lean
When you roll up in your Hot Tub Time Machine
Yeah your shirts a little psychedelic
And youre lookin kinda like Tom Selleck
Yeah the chicks are wetter than the Everglades
But double bag your dude dont wanna get AIDS
Just listen right up consider me your dean
In the college of the Hot Tub Time Machine
Yeah
Hot Tub - Time Machine
Hot Tub - Time Machine
Yeah

Lily goes into the CLOSET

ADAM
Sweetie
She comes out a moment later with a CARDBOARD BOX which she
empties onto the BED About FIFTY PORNO MAGAZINES spill out
ranging from TITS MONTHLY to BLACK ASS

ADAM (CONTD)
How did you know where I hid my
treasure
Lily carefully picks up a BROCHURE from the pile holding it
by the corner not wanting to touch it

LILY
Explain this
From ADAMS POV we see the brochure
-- A ski brochure featuring Jennie on the cover
ADAM
OK You caught me I
occasionally reminisce about
Jennie OKeefe

LILY
Thats gross

(THEN)
Whats occasionally

ADAM
(without missing a beat)
About two hours ago when you were
on the phone with your mother

LILY
Jesus Tell me how Im supposed to
let you go to your bachelor party
and not be a basket case

ADAM
What are you so worried about

LILY
Im worried that youre still
thinking about this girl

ADAM
Baby the girl in that picture was
nothing more than a crush I could
never get her and theres no
possibility Ill ever be with her
She was a total stranger
Lily gets a CURIOUS LOOK on her face

LILY
So youre into strangers

ADAM
Well not the creepy your mom was
in an accident now come with me
kind But yeah the hot lady in
the supermarket kind of stranger
You have to admit - its kinda hot

LILY
So youre saying if you and I
didnt know each other it would be
pretty hot if we fooled around

ADAM

fucking incredible

Lily smiles seductively as Adam starts to get it

ADAM (CONTD)
Wait a minute Are you
suggesting yes YES
Adam excitedly heads for the door

ADAM (CONTD)

OK Ill go down the hall You get

into character

(points at her)

This fucking rules

Adam leaves the room and Lily REMOVES HER SHIRT talking
sexy

and slowly building the fantasy

LILY
Oh Im all alone in this big house
Cheerleading camp just ended and I
need to get out of these sweaty
clothes

ADAM (0S)

Love where youre going with this

baby Keep it up

She unbuttons her pants and SLIDES DOWN HER JEANS

LILY
Mmmm My panties are so tight

against my firm naked body

ADAM (0S)
You should probably take them off

LILY
Are you gonna let me do this

ADAM (0S)

Sorry Continue You were just

about to take off your panties

She slowly slides out of her panties kicking them away Now
shes TOTALLY NAKED She continues to role play

LILY
It feels so good to be so naked I
hope no one can see me
Just then a BLACK MAN (late 30s handsome J Crew) saunters
through the bedroom door holding a coffee and all riled up

BLACK MAN
OK so this asshole in front of me
at the donut place is -- WHOA

Lily covers up and SCREAMS

LILY
Get out of here
He SPILLS the coffee on his hands and their rug as he turns

BLACK MAN
Fuck Ow Im sorry Ill clean
it up Thats gonna stain though

LILY
Just leave
He heads for the door just as
Adam comes in wearing a MAILMAN hat and NOTHING ELSE

ADAM
Special delivery for -- Jesus
Christ
The black man doesnt know which way to look He covers his
eyes and drips coffee as he blindly steps toward the door

BLACK MAN
(NOT LOOKING)
Just tell me when Im in the clear

CUT TO
EXT ADAMS HOUSE - DAY

Adam wheels his suitcase down the front path of this modest

well-kept suburban home as a recovered dressed
embarrassed

and somewhat shell-shocked Lily follows with a small bag

They both stop 10 yards short of a RANGE ROVER where the

black man NICK waits in the car waving

LILY
I cant wait for you to come back
and marry me Wow thats crazy
Adam looks almost like it just hit him

ADAM
Yeah
(REALIZATION)
Wow
LILY

Tell me again I have nothing to
worry about

ADAM
Babe look at Nick
In the car Nick air drums to whatevers on the radio

ADAM (CONTD)

and Ill twist my ankle getting off
the ski lift

LILY
OK Have an awesome bachelor
party Not too awesome
(hands him bag)

I got you something

Adam looks in the bag

ADAM
Sandwich Thanks
He puts it in his BACKPACK She looks like she was expecting
a different reaction but she lets it go He kisses her

LILY
Let me see your phone
He takes it out

ADAM
I told you Ill call you when--
She snatches it out of his hands Adam looks confused as
she pockets the phone

LILY
Despite my anxiety Im not gonna
be one of those women who wants an
update every ten minutes Even
though I do want an update every
ten minutes
Adam smiles Lily looks a bit trepidatious

LILY (CONTD)
Just make sure whatever happens
youre back for the rehearsal
dinner

(SHOWING CONCERN)
I totally trust you

ADAM
You should Im a lame-o

LILY
Well at least youre a cute lame-o

disgusting display of affection A FLASH goes off
From the car Nick holds up his iPhone

INT NICKS CAR - DAY - DRIVING

NICK
Gentlemen welcome to Havenhurst

ADAM

EXT HAVENHURST MAIN DRAG - AFTERNOON

The car winds through the main thoroughfare Rather than a
quaint ski town this place resembles a suburban nightmare
with STRIP MALLS and CHAIN RESTAURANTS Its the exact
opposite of the fun town we saw in Adams photos

The guys look out the windows wearing bummed expressions

JACOB

INT PINE VALLEY INN HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

The guys walk silently behind a MIDDLE-AGED BELLHOP (PHIL)
who struggles to wrangle their bags on a shaky hand truck
His job is made more difficult because he only has ONE ARM
He grunts and curses his way down the hall on the slow and
laborious journey But when Adam tries to pick up a bag

PHIL

leaving the guys outside their room

NICK
Gentlemen in this room lies the
beginning of our awesome weekend

like mold and there is nothing redeemable about the place

ADAM

the situation -- presently the dirty old room

JACOB
What the hell is with this place

EXT PINE VALLEY INN PATIO - NIGHT

Lou Adam and Nick all have HUGE SMILES as they gaze at
the
tub They each hold a TON OF BOOZE

Jacob looks indifferent and a little turned off by it all
Lou strips down to his underwear and CLIMBS IN

LOU
Oh my god The water is perfect

He POURS A VODKA and SLAMS IT BACK
Adam climbs in with Lou pouring his own drink

JACOB
I really dont see the appeal
Its like a glorified bath

NICK
Jacob Son The hot tub is the
whole thing You ski all day
Then you hit the town get trashed
and lure some fine ladies back to
the lodge for some good old
fashioned tubbin
Nick CRACKS A BEER and pats Jacob on the back

NICK (CONTD)
So the towns dead Fine we skip
that part and go right to the tub
Trust me If theres fun to be
had the tub is a good start
Nick gets in

NICK (CONTD)
Yes Its amazing
Now its just Jacob outside the hot tub The other three
guys are already starting to look more energized and happy
splashing around After another beat of consideration

JACOB
Fuck it
Jacob strips down and gets in As he submerges he actually
starts to loosen up a bit and smiles

LOU
Well

JACOB
Im not convinced this is anything
more than a bath but its nice
HIM

NICK
Hit him with some bubbles

ADAM
Coming right up
Adam CRANKS A KNOB As the BUBBLES comes to life we begin a
TUBBIN MONTAGE over Reel 2 Reals I Like to Move It

-- In the tub the guys DRINK like fish pouring various
combinations of VODKA RED BULL MOUNTAIN DEW BACARDI and
anything else they can get their hands on

-- Jacobs LAPTOP is propped on the edge of the tub playing
BETTER OFF DEAD Every so often one of our guys takes a
drink playing a game the rules of which only they know
-- Adam takes a big bite of the SANDWICH Lily gave him

-- Nick uses his iPhone to take video and pictures

More drinking games The guys wear funny HATS and roll

dice on a PIECE OF WOOD Adam has to drink some tub water
-- The guys keep reaching into ADAMS BACKPACK for MIXERS
-- Nick Adam and Lou LAUGH Then Lou lifts up Jacobs
head which he has been FORCIBLY HOLDING UNDER WATER Jacob
coughs and spits out water and looks pissed Then he smiles
and helps submerge Nicks head in the same way

-- Slam Another bottle of vodka killed Crush Another
empty Red Bull his the patio

-- A BEAR eats some DORITOS that have been left on a PICNIC
TABLE Yards away in the tub the guys laugh and taunt it
-- Lou BLEEDS from where the bear has obviously SCRATCHED

across the chest Still he dances in the tub

-- Just for an instant (did we see that) the guys are 3
BLACK GUYS and ONE WHITE GUY before changing back

-- The guys wear their SNOWSUITS in the tub Adam very
dangerously jumps in attached to a SNOWBOARD

-- The CUTS get QUICKER and QUICKER as hands reach into the
backpack More vodka More Dew More Red Bull More
Bacardi The cuts SPEED UP and INTENSIFY until finally in

BRILLIANT FLASH OF LIGHT we

EXPLODE TO
all

THE SUN RISING JUST ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN PEAKS
EXT PINE VALLEY INN PATIO - DAWN
As the light of a new day spills into Havenhurst we find

four of our guys PASSED OUT in the hot tub the water calm
A KITTEN licks Lous face Its adorable Until

Lou JOLTS AWAKE and PUKES ON THE KITTEN sending it FLYING
This wakes up everyone and they stir to life inspecting the
carnage mostly hangover-related

NICK
Oh my god I wanna die

JACOB

Adam reaches in his backpack taking out two choices

ADAM
Red Bull or Fresca
Jacob takes the Fresca as Lou inspects the CLAW MARKS

LOU

Adam starts listening a little more closely as some of

Lous

logic actually makes some sense

LOU (CONTD)
Its time to start facing the fact
that we may not be going home And
if thats so then we owe it to
ourselves to make the best life we
can for ourselves
The guys listen intently as Lous speech reaches a
passionate climax

LOU (CONTD)
Because I dont want to be that

crowd claps Our guys are confused and upset

NICK

SANDY

OK we dare Lou to put a Twizzler

LOU
You son of a bitch Have you ever
played this game before Its

Lou nevertheless grabs a TWIZZLER from the snack bowl and
shoves it down the back of his pants His face contorts
uncomfortably and he is almost on the verge of tears

LOU (CONTD)

Lou sits down and Michelle consoles him

MICHELLE

Blaine takes off down the mountain like a professional
skiier which he pretty much is Adam looks toward Jacob
who demonstrates the proper CROUCH Adam slowly picks up
speed starting at about one mile per hour

Blaine looks back and cant believe how easily hes gonna
coast to victory

ADAM
Here goes nothing
Instead of weaving back and forth Adam just stays in the
crouch PICKING UP SPEED He recklessly PASSES BLAINE
despite the many TREES and OBSTACLES on the course
He BEARS DOWN AND TRAVELS LIKE A BOLT OF LIGHTNING

Blaine finds the guts to alter his STYLE skiing more
recklessly too He begins catching up to Adam

Blaine skis up next to Adam - theyre both going full force

BLAINE
You cant beat me I was born on
this mountain

ADAM
I was born in a hospital like a
normal baby
Adam bends down and picks up even more speed NARROWLY
MISSING trees and rocks Blaine tries to keep up
Adam has the finish line in his sights when he rolls the
dice once too often His SNOWBOARD GETS SNAGGED on a rock
and Adam TUMBLES TO THE GROUND

The SNOWBOARD FLIES OFF INTO THE AIR

Cut TO

Phil stands against a SHED as a GUY THROWS A HATCHET at

the victory in the bag

But instead of stopping Adam picks up speed as he TUMBLES
LIMB OVER LIMB like a snowball going down the mountain
With 50 YARDS to go Blaine bears down and tries to catch
Adam Its gonna be close

At the FINISH LINE Adams CRUMPLED BODY passes the line
first Blaine pulls up pissed off to lose the race

Adams momentum carries him forward another 50 yards where
he SMASHES INTO A DECK and finally comes to a stop

And I cant wait any longer
(listening to himself)
And Im totally cool with it
Adam smiles feeling the rush of knowing hes ready But
then he sees how sad Jennie is He moves closer to her

LOU

LOU

ADAM

nose thing But no it was just a
murder I didnt suffer
