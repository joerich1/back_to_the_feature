Shooting Script 1940
AN OKLAHOMA PAVED HIGHWAY in daylight

At some distance hoofing down the highway comes Tom Joad
He wears a new stiff suit of clothes ill-fitting anda
stiff new cap which he gradually manages to break down into
something comfortable He comes down the left side of the
road the better to watch the cars that pass him As he
approaches the scene changes to a roadside short-order
RESTAURANT on the right side of the road From it comes the
sound of a phonograph playing a 1939 popular song In front
of the eatery is a huge Diesel truck labeled OKLAHOMA CITY
TRANSPORT COMPANY The driver a heavy man with army breeches
and high-laced boots comes out of the restaurant the screen
door slamming behind him He is chewing on a toothpick A
waitress appears at the door behind the screen

WAITRESS
When you be back

DRIVER
Couple a weeks Dont do nothin you
wouldnt want me to hear about

We see him climbing into the cab of the truck from the right
side Getting behind the wheel he is releasing the handbrake
when Tom appears at the drivers seat window

TOM
How about a lift mister

DRIVER
Cant you see that sticker

He indicates a No Riders sticker on the windshield

TOM
Sure I see it But a good guy dont
pay no attention to what some heel
makes him stick on his truck

After a moment of hesitation the driver releases the brake
DRIVER
Scrunch down on the running board

till we get around the bend

As Tom scrunches down on the running board the driver throws
the truck into gear and it moves
The scene dissolves to the CAB OF THE TRUCK It is day and
Tom is seated beside the driver who is surreptitiously
eyeing him trying to confirm some suspicion--an inspection
which Tom ignores at first

DRIVER
Goin far

TOM
(shaking his head)
Just a few miles Id a walked her
if my dogs wasnt pooped out

DRIVER
Lookin for a job

TOM
No my old man got a place forty
acres Hes a sharecropper but we
been there a long time

DRIVER
(after a curious glance)
Oh

Cautiously the drivers eyes drop to Toms feet We see
TOMS SHOES They are prison shoes--new stiff and bulky

Curiosity is in the eyes of the DRIVER as they shoot a swift
glance at Tom TOM is looking straight ahead with the dead-
pan look that prisoners get when they are trying to conceal
something The DRIVERS eyes take in Toms hands and the
stiff coat

DRIVER
Been doin a job

TOM
Yeah

DRIVER

I seen your hands You been swinging
a pick or a sledge--that shines up
your hands I notice little things
like that all the time

(After a pause)
Got a trade

TOM

(evenly)
Why dont you get to it buddy

( )

DRIVER
(uneasily)
Get to what

TOM
You know what I mean You been givin
me a goin over ever since I got in
Whynt you go on and ask me where I
been

DRIVER
I dont stick my nose in nobodys
business

TOM
Naw--not much

DRIVER
(a little frightened)
I stay in my own yard

TOM
(without emotion)

Listen That big nose of yours been
goin over me like a sheep ina
vegetable patch But I aint keepin
it a secret I been in the
penitentiary Been there four years
Like to know anything else

DRIVER
You aint got to get sore

TOM
(coldly)
Go ahead Ask me anything you want

DRIVER
I didnt mean nothing

TOM
Me neither Im just tryin to get
along without shovin anybody around
thats all
(after a pause)
See that road up ahead

DRIVER
Yeah

TOM
Thats where I get off

( )

With a sigh of relief the driver puts his foot on the brake

The TRUCK stops and Tom gets out He look at the uneasy driver
contemptuously

TOM
Youre about to bust to know what I
done aint you Well I ainta
guy to let you down
(confidentially)
Homicide

The driver throws the truck into gear He doesnt like this
at all

DRIVER
I never asked you

TOM
(as the truck moves
away )
Sure but youd a throwed a fit if I
hadnt tol you

He looks indifferently after the truck and then starts on
foot down the dirt crossroad A wind has begun to blow

The scene dissolves to the roadside under a WILLOW TREE in
daylight The wind is still blowing Sitting on the ground
his back against the tree Casy a long lean man in
overalls blue shirt and one sneaker is fixing something
on the other dirty sneaker To the tune of Yes Sir Thats
My Baby he is absent-mindedly singing

CASY
Mmmmm hes my saviour Mmmmm my
saviour Mmmmmmmmmm my saviour now
(looking up as Tom
comes down the road)
Howdy friend

Carrying his coat under his arm TOM wipes his face with his
cap as he cuts off the road to acknowledge the greeting

TOM
Howdy

He stops grateful for the momentary relief of the shade
CASY

Say aint you young Tom Joad--ol
Toms boy

( )

TOM
(surprised)
Yeah On my way home now

CASY
Well I do declare
(Grinning)
I baptized you son

TOM
(staring)
Why youre the preacher

CASY
Used to be Not no more I lost the
call
(Reminiscently)

But boy I sure used to have it

Id get an irrigation ditch so
squirmin full of repented sinners I
pretty near drowned half of ‘em

(Sighing)
But not no more I lost the sperit

TOM
(with a grin)
Pa always said you was never cut out
to be a preacher

CASY
I got nothin to preach about no
more--thats all I aint so sure o

things

TOM
Maybe you should a got yourself a
wife

CASY

(shakes his head sadly)
At my meetins I used to get the
girls glory-shoutin till they about
passed out Then Id go to comfort
‘em--and always end up by lovin
em Id feel bad an pray an
pray but it didnt do no good Next
time do it again I figgered there
just wasnt no hope for me

TOM

I never let one go by me when I could
catch her

( )

CASY

But you wasnt a preacher A girl
was just a girl to you But to me
they was holy vessels I was savin
their souls

(Fervently)
I ast myself--what is this call the
Holy Sperit Maybe thats love
Why I love everybody so much Im
fit to bust sometimes So maybe
there aint no sin an there aint
no virtue Theres just what people
do Some things folks do is nice
and some aint so nice But thats
as far as any mans got a right to
say

TOM

(after a moment
figuring there is no
percentage in
continuing this
philosophical
discussion pulls
out a flask which
he extends )

Have a little snort

CASY

(holding the flask)
Course Ill say grace if somebody
sets out the food--

(shaking his head)
--but my heart aint in it

(He takes a long pull)
Nice drinkin liquor

TOM
Ought to be Thats factry liquor
Cost me a buck

CASY
(handing back the
flask)
Been out travelin around

TOM
Didnt you hear It was in the papers

CASY
No I never What

( )

TOM
I been in the penitentiary for four
years
(He drinks)

CASY
Excuse me for asking

TOM
I dont mind any more Id do what I
done again I killed a guy at a dance
We was drunk He got a knife in me
and I laid him out with a shovel
Knocked his head plumb to squash

CASY
And you aint ashamed

TOM
(shaking his head)
He had a knife in me Thats why
they only gave me seven years Got
out in four--parole

CASY
Aint you seen your folks since then

TOM
(putting on his coat)
No but I aim to before sundown
Gettin kind of excited about it
too Which way you going

CASY
(putting on his sneaker)
It dont matter Ever since I lost
the sperit it looks like I just as
soon go one way as the other
(Rising)
Ill go your way

They pause at the edge of the shade squint up at the sky
and then move off

The scene
daylight

dissolves to the SURFACE OF A DIRT ROAD by

Leaves are scuttling across it The top soil begins to fly

up It is

not a hard wind as yet but it is steady and

persistent Toms and Casys feet walk into sight

( )

TOM
Maybe Mall have pork for supper I
aint had pork but four times in
four years--every Christmas

CASY
Ill be glad to see you pa Last
time I seen him was at a baptizin
an he had one a the bigges doses
of the Holy Sperit I ever seen He
go to jumpin over bushes howlin
like a dog-wolf in moon-time Finly
he picks hisself out a bush big as a
piana an he let out a squawk an
took a run at that bush Well sir
he cleared her but he bust his leg
snap in two They was a travellin
dentist there and he set her an I

wasnt no more Holy Sperit in your
pa after that

TOM
(worriedly)
Lissen This winds fixint to do
somepin
CASY
Shore it is It always is this time
a year

Tom holding his cap on his head with his hand looks up

The TOPS OF THE TREES are bending before the wind TOM AND
CASY continue walking

CASY
Is it fur

TOM
(still looking back)
Just around that next bend

TOM AND CASY are almost being blown along and dust is rising
from the road

CASY
(lifting his voice
above the wind)
Your granma was a great one too
The third time she got religion she
go it so powerful she knocked down a
full-growed deacon with her fist

( )

TOM
(pointing ahead)
Thats our place

The JOAD CABIN is an ancient bleak sway-backed building
There is neither sign of life or habitation about it

CASY
(looking back)
And it aint any too close either
We better run

A DUST STORM like a black wall rises into the sky moving
forward TOM AND CASY are running but looking back over
their shoulders as the DUST STORM nears Dust rises from the
ground to join and thicken the black wall

TOM AND CASY are seen racing down the road to the cabin the
wind whipping up the dust The two men smack open the door
and slam it shut after them The screen begins to grow dark
as the storm sweeps over the land It becomes black

In THE CABIN it is black too but the sound is different

In addition to the sound of the wind there is the soft hissing
of sand against the house

TOMS VOICE
Ma Pa Aint nobody here
(After a long silence)
Somepins happened

CASYS VOICE
You got a match

TOMS VOICE
There was some pieces of candle always
on a shelf

Presently after shuffling about he has found them and lights
one He holds it up lighting the room A couple of wooden
boxes are on the floor a few miserable discarded things

and thats all Toms eyes are bewildered

TOM
Theyre all gone--or dead

CASY
They never wrote you nothing

TOM
No They wasnt people to write

( )

From the floor he picks up a womans high button shoe
up at the toe and broken over the instep

TOM
This was Mas Had em for years

Dropping the shoe he picks up a battered felt hat

TOM
This used to be mine I give it to
Grampa when I went away
(To Casy)
You reckon they could be dead

CASY
I never heard nothin about it

curled

Dropping the hat he moves with the candle toward the door
to the back the only other room of the cabin He stands in

the doorway holding the candle high

In the BACK ROOM the scene moves from Tom at the door across

the room to the shadows where a skinny little man sits
motionless wide-eyed staring at Tom His name is Mule

MULEY
Tommy

TOM
(entering)
Muley Wheres my folks Muley

MULEY
(dully)
They gone
TOM
(irritated)

I know that But where they gone

Muley does not reply He is looking up at Casy as he enters

TOM
(to Casy)
This is Muley Graves
(To Muley)

CASY

( )

TOM
(impatiently)
All right you remember the man then

(angrily)

(After a pause)
Everbody but me I aint gettin

TOM

MULEY

(Impatiently Tom

listens to the storm)
Thats some of what done it--the
dusters Started it anyway Blowin
like this year after year--blowin
the land away blowin the crops
away blowin us away now

TOM

(angrily)
Are you crazy

( )

MULEY
(simply)
Some say I am
(After a pause)
You want to hear what happened

TOM
Thats what I asked you aint it

MULEY is seen at close range Not actually crazy Muley is a
little touched His eyes rove upward as he listens to the
sound of the storm the sough of the wind and the soft hiss
of the sand Then

MULEY
The way it happens--the way it
happened to me--the man come one
day

The scene dissolves to MULEYS DOORYARD It is a soft spring
day with the peaceful sounds of the country Seated in a
three-year-old touring car is THE MAN a city man with a
collar and tie He hates to do what he is doing and this
makes him gruff and curt to hide his misgivings Squatted
beside the car are Muley his son-in-law and a half-grown
son At a respectful distance stand Muleys wife his
daughter with a baby in her arms and a small barefooted
girl watching worriedly The men soberly trace marks on the
ground with small sticks A hound dog sniffs at the
automobile wheels

THE MAN
Fact of the matter Muley after
what them dusters done to the land
the tenant system dont work no more
It dont even break even much less
show a profit One man on a tractor
can handle twelve or fourteen of
these places You just pay hima
wage and take all the crop

MULEY

But we couldnt do on any lessn
what our share is now

(Looking around)
The chillun aint gettin enough to
eat as it is and theyre so ragged
wed be shamed if everbody elses
chillun wasnt the same way

( )

THE MAN
(irritably)
I cant help that All I know is I
got my orders They told me to tell
you you got to get off and thats
what Im telling you

Muley stands in anger The two younger men pattern after
him

MULEY
You mean get off my own land

THE MAN
Now dont go blaming me It aint my
fault

SON

Whose fault is it

THE MAN
You know who owns the land--the
Shawnee Land and Cattle Company

MULEY
Whos the Shawnee Land and Cattle
Comp ny

THE MAN

It aint nobody Its a company

SON
They got a presdent aint they
They got somebody that knows what a
shotguns for aint they

THE MAN
But it aint his fault because the
bank tells him what to do

SON
(angrily)
All right Wheres the bank
THE MAN
(fretfully)

Tulsa But whats the use of picking
on him He aint anything but the
manager and half crazy hisself
trying to keep up with his orders
from the east

( )

MULEY
(bewildered)
Then who do we shoot

THE MAN
(stepping on the
starter)
Brother I dont know If I did Id
tell you But I just dont know whos
to blame

MULEY

(angrily)
Well Im right here to tell you
mister aint nobody going to push
me off my land Grampa took up this
land seventy years ago My pa was
born here We was all born on it
and some of us got killed on it and
some died on it And thats what
makes it ourn--bein born on it and
workin it and dyin on it--and not
no piece of paper with writin on
it So just come on and try to push
me off

The scene dissolves to the BACK ROOM The sound of the storm
is heard again as Tom and Casy watch Muley

TOM
(angrily)
Well

MULEY
(without emotion)
They come They come and pushed me
off

We see MULEY at close range

MULEY
They come with the cats

TOMS VOICE
The what

MULEY
The cats--the caterpillar tractors

The scene dissolves to a MONTAGE OF TRACTORS tractors
looming over hillocks flattening fences through gullies
their drivers looking like robots with goggles dust masks
over mouth and nose--one after the other crossing and
recrossing

As if to convey the impression that this was an invasion of
machine-men from some other world

MULEYS VOICE
And for ever one of ‘em ten-fifteen
families gets throwed outa their
homes--one hundred folks with no
place to live but on the road The
Rances the Perrys the Peterses
the Joadses--one after another they
got throwed out Half the folks you
and me know--throwed right out into
the road The one that got me come a
month ago

The scene dissolves to MULEYS FARM We see the backs of
Muley and the two younger men standing shoulder to shoulder
watching a lumbering tractor headed straight toward them It
is at some distance Muley holds a shotgun His son has a
baling hook The son-in-law has a two-by-four Behind them
is their cabin Frightened and huddled together are the
women and children The roar of the tractor comes closer

MULEY
(shouting)
You come any closer and Im gonna
blow you right outa that cat
(He lifts his shotgun)

The TRACTOR continues to lumber along its driver goggled
and black of face where his dust mask doesnt cover MULEY
lifts his shotgun to his shoulder and aims

MULEY
I tol you

The TRACTOR stops The driver takes off his goggles and dust
mask Like the others hes a country boy His face is sullen

Muley is lowering his shotgun There is a surprise in his
face as he recognizes the driver

MULEY
Why youre Joe Daviss boy

He moves forward followed by his son and son-in-law in the
TRACTOR Davis is wiping his face as they walk toward him

( )

DAVIS
I dont like nobody drawin a bead
on me
MULEY

Then what are you doin this kind a
thing for--against your own people

DAVIS
For three dollars a day thats what
Im doin it for I got two little
kids I got a wife and my wifes
mother Them people got to eat Fust
and ony thing I got to think about
is my own folks What happens to
other folks is their lookout

MULEY
But this is my land son Dont you
understand

DAVIS
(putting his goggles
back on)
Used to be your land Blongs to the
compny now

We see THE WOMENFOLKS A small girl pulls her mothers dress

GIRL
Whats he fixin to do ma

MA
Hush

Back to the TRACTOR AND THE MEN

MULEY
(grimly)
Have it your own way son but just
as sure as you touch my house with
that cat Im gonna blow you plumb to
kingdom come

DAVIS
(contemptuous 1y )
You aint gonna blow nobody nowhere
First place youd get hung and you
know it For another it wouldnt be
two days before theyd have another
guy here to take my place

And the tractor roars into slow motion again

( )

We see the HOUSE AND TRACTOR The womenfolks scamper out of
the way as the tractor heads for a corner of the house It
goes over a ramshackle fence and then a feeble little flower
bed Muley and the two younger men walk along Breathing
hard frightened and desperate Muley is shouting warnings
at Davis but the roar of the tractor drowns his voice The
dog barks excitedly snarling at the tractor THE WOMENFOLKS
stand watching terrified but dead pan until a cry bursts
from Muleys wife

WIFE
Dont Please dont

The little girl begins to whimper

MULEY
Im tellin you

The TRACTOR moves across the yard nosing a chair out of the
way and with a rending of boards hits a corner of the house
knocking a part of the foundation away The corner of the
house sinks MULEY lifts his shotgun aims it holds it and
then slowly lowers it As he stands looking at what has
happened his shoulders sag He seems almost to shrink

The scene dissolves to MULEY once more in the back room of
Toms old home as the sound of the storm continues

MULEY
(dully)
What was the use He was right There
wasnt a thing in the world I could
do about it

TOM
(bewildered)
But it dont seem possible--kicked
off like that

MULEY
The rest of my fambly set out for
the west--there wasnt nothin to
eat--but I couldnt leave Somepin
wouldnt let me So now I just wander
around Sleep wherever I am I used
to tell myself I was lookin out for
things so when they come back
everthing would be all right But I
knowed that want true There aint
nothin to look out for And aint
nobody comin back Theyre gone--
and me Im just an ‘ol graveyard
ghost--thats all in the world I am

( )

Tom rises in his agitation and bewilderment

MULEY
You think Im touched
CASY
(sympathetically)
No Youre lonely--but you aint
touched
MULEY

It dont matter If Im touched Im
touched and thats all there is to
it

TOM

(still unable to grasp

it all)
What I cant understand is my folks
takin it Like ma I seen her nearly
beat a peddler to death with a live
chicken She aimed to go for him
with an ax she had in the other hand
but she got mixed up and forgot which
hand was which and when she got
through with that peddler all she
had left was two chicken legs

He looks down at Muley

MULEY
Just a plain ‘ol graveyard ghost
thats all

His eyes are dull on the floor The sound of the dust storm
continues strongly

The scene dissolves to the EXTERIOR OF THE CABIN at night

It is several hours later and the sound of the storm has
faded out Now all is silence as first Tom then Casy and
finally Muley steps out of the cabin and looks around There
is still a slight fog of dust in the air and clouds of
powderlike dust shoot up around their feet All three men
have wet rags tied over their mouths and noses

TOM
Shes settlin

CASY
What you figger to do

( )

TOM
Its hard to say Stay here till
mornin’ an then go on over to Uncle
Johns I reckon After that I dont
know

MULEY
(grabbing Tom)
Listen
(Faint sound of motor)
Thats them Them lights Come on
we got to hide out

TOM
(angrily)
Hide out for what We aint doin
nothin

MULEY
(terrified)
Youre trespassin It aint you
lan no more An thats the
suprtendant--with a gun

CASY
Come on Tom Youre on parole

A CAR approaches at some distance the headlights moving up
and down as the car rides a dirt road

A PART OF THE COTTON FIELD Muley leads the way

MULEY
All you got to do is lay down an
watch

TOM

(as they lie down)
Wont they come out here

MULEY
(snickering)
I dont think so One come out here
once an I clipped him from behin
with a fence stake They aint
bothered since

THE EXTERIOR OF THE CABIN The car stops A strong
searchlight flashes on and goes over the cabin

MAN
(in car)
Muley
(After a pause)
He aint here

The car moves on

TOM CASY AND MULEY lie flat listening to the sound of the
car going away

TOM
Anybody ever ‘tol me Id be hidin
out on my own place

He whistles as the scene fades out

DRIED CORNSTALKS seen by daylight fade in The cornstalks
their roots blown clean and clear of the earth lie fallen
in one direction This is what has happened to farms that
were once rich and green Then Uncle Johns cabin comes into
view It is just after sunup The air is filled with country
sounds--a shrill chorus of birds a dog barking in the
distance The cabin is of the same general appearance as the
Joad cabin but even smaller Smoke curls from the chimney

We see a PLATTER ON A TABLE inside the cabin The platter
is filled with sidemeat Over the scene comes Ma Joads
voice

MAS VOICE
Lord make us thankful for what we
are about to receive for His sake
Amen

As she speaks a mans scrawny hand reaches forward and sneaks
out a piece of sidemeat

Five people are seated around the breakfast table on chairs
or boxes They are Pa Grampa Granma Noah and Uncle John

Two children Ruthie and Winfield stand to the table because
there are no more chairs Their heads are all bent as Ma
standing with a fork in her hand between the table and the
stove ends the grace Heads lift and there is a bustle as

Ma turns back to the frying pork on the stove and the others
truck into their food Granma points a spiteful finger at
Grampa

( )

GRANMA
I seen you--You et durin grace

GRAMPA
(indignantly)
One little ole dab--one teeny little
ole dab

RUTHIE AND WINFIELD though they are shoveling it in are
grinning at Grampa

RUTHIE
(in a snickering
whisper to Winfield)
Aint he messy though

GRANMA
(viciously)
I seen him--gobblin away like an
ole pig
GRAMPA

Whynt you keep your eyes shet durin
grace you ole

NOAH is solemnly studying a handbill Over his shoulder the
HANDBILL can be read 800 PICKERS WANTED--WORK IN CALIFORNIA

We see NOAH AND UNCLE JOHN

NOAH
(who is a half-wit)
Whats it say again

JOHN
Says plenty work in California--
peaches Eight hundred pickers needed

Noah frowns at the print

GRAMPA

(who has mush on his

mouth)
Waitll I get to California Gonna
reach up and pick me an orange
whenever I want it Or grapes That
theres somethin I aint never had
enough of Gonna get me a whole bunch
a grapes off a bush and Im gonna
squash ‘em all over my face and just
let the juice dreen down offen my
chin

( )

GRANMA
(in a feeble bleat)
Puh-raise the Lawd for vittory

GRAMPA
(expanding)
Maybe I get me a whole washtub fulla
them grapes and jest sit in ‘em and
scrooge around till they was gone
(Sighing)
I shore would like to do that

RUTHIE AND WINFIELD are snickering Ruthie has smeared her
face with mush She pulls Winfield around to see

RUTHIE
(whispering)
Look Im Grampa

She begins to slobber in mimicry Winfield snickers At that
instant Ma enters unobserved and without a word give Ruthie
a fine wallop Nobody else pays any attention to the slap as
Ma a bucket in her hand moves on toward the door We see

her now in the BACKYARD first at the door then moving toward
the well She stops dead still her eyes gazing outward

TOM is looking at the household goods piled around the yard
to be taken to California Casy is in the background Then
Tom looks up and see Ma (out of the scene) His face softens

He moves toward her

MA

(softly--her eyes

closed)
Thank God Oh thank God

(In sudden terror as

he approaches )
Tommy you didnt bust out didya
You aint got to hide have you

TOM
No Ma Im paroled I got my papers

With a sigh and a smile and her eyes full of wonder she
feels his arm Her fingers touch his cheek as if she were
blind Swelling with emotion Tom bites his lip to control
himself

MA
I was so scared we was goin away
without you--and wed never see each
other again

( )

TOM
Id a found you Ma

CASY with great politeness turns his back to the scene and
keeps well away from it

TOM now looks around at the dusty furniture piled around the
yard

TOM
Muley tol me what happened Ma Are
we goin to California true

MA
We got to Tommy But thats gonna
be awright I seen the hanbills
about how much work they is an

(Breathlessly)

Did they hurt you son Did they

TOM
(puzzled)
Mad Ma
MA

TOM
(gently)
No Ma I was at first--but not no

MA
(not yet quite
convinced)

Sometimes they do somethin to you
Tommy They hurt you--and you get
mad--and then you get mean--and they
hurt you again--and you get meaner

TOM
(grinning)

( )

MA

SON
(She loves him with
her eyes)

At the DOOR Pa is staring toward
them his mouth open

PA
(almost to himself)
Its Tommy
(Then shouting inside)
Its Tommy back
(Heading for Tom)
Whatd you do son--bust out

INSIDE UNCLE JOHNS CABIN all but Granma are staring toward
the door Then all but Granma scramble to their feet headed
for the door

WINFIELD AND RUTHIE
(in an excited chant)
Toms outa ja-ul Toms outa ja-ul

GRAMPA
I knowed it Couldnt keep him in
Cant keep a Joad in I knowed it
from the fust

The children and Grampa scramble out first followed hurriedly
but less rowdily by Uncle John and Noah Granma aware only
that there is some excitement looks interestedly after them
but decides against any activity

GRANMA
(vaguely)
Puh-raise the Lawd for vittory
(she resumes eating)

In the BACKYARD the prodigal son mother and father proudly
beside him is having his hand wrung by Grampa who vainly
tries to button various buttons of his shirt as always The
two children jump up and down excitedly but are too shy to
force themselves into the reception

GRAMPA
(to Pa)
You know what I alays said Tom1l

bull through a corral fence Cant
keep no Joad in jail

( )

TOM

(grinning)

Howya Noah Howya Uncle John

NOAH AND JOHN

Fine Tommy Glad to see you

GRAMPA

(to anybody )
I was the same way myself Put me in
jail and Id bust right out Couldnt

hold me

As Tom chucks the two children under the chin the rattling
roar of a jalopy causes all to turn to look

NOAH
(confidentially)
Bust out
TOM

(shaking his head)

Parole

The roar increases

A home-built TRUCK comes around the corner

of the house Once a Hudson sedan the top has been cut in
two and a truck body constructed It is driven now by Al
and on the front seat with him are Rosasharn and Connie The
arrival as the truck moves into the yard increases the
excitement and the scene is a little incoherent with the
talking and shouting and the noise of the jalopy

AL AND ROSASHARN

Hi Tom Howya doin

TOM

(surprised and pleased)

Rosasharn

Hi Rosasharn Howya Al

GRAMPA

(wildly)
The jailbirds back The jailbirds

OMNES

down )

TOM
(patiently)

AL
(let down)

ROSASHARN

Heho Tom
(Proudly)
This is Connie my husband

TOM
(shaking hands)
If this dont beat all
(Chuckling)
Well I see you been busy already

ROSASHARN
(gasping)
You do not see either--not yet

At the whoop of laughter that goes up from all

she turns in

a fine simulation of maidenly mortification and throws

herself into Connies arms hiding her face against his chest

After a moment of surprise a slow happy fatuous grin begins

to broaden his face He beams whereupon their delight
increases the men roaring and jeering and slapping their
legs the women making modest efforts to suppress their

amusement

OMNES
Lookut his face Ysee his face
Lookut Rosasharn Yever see anything
like her face when Tom said it Look
around Rosasharn Lets see it again

( )

An automobile horn sounds sharply Their laughter halted as
though cut by a knife they look off A TOURING CAR has
stopped in the road by the house the engine still running

One man drives the other talks

MAN
Hey Joad John Joad

In the BACKYARD the people are silent their faces without
expression as all gaze toward the touring car

MAN
Aint forgot have you

JOHN
We aint forgot

MAN
Comin through here tomorrow you
know

JOHN

I know We be out We be out by sunup

The touring cars engine is still heard after the men drive
off The Joads watch the car their heads turning their
eyes following expressionless

The scene dissolves to the BACKYARD just before dawn Now
and then a rooster crows A couple of lanterns light the
scene as the man load the truck It is nearly done the body
piled high but flat with boxes and more tied on running
boards Al has the hood open and is working on the motor

Noah Casy Uncle John Connie Pa and Tom are at various
tasks They talk as they work

TOM
(to Pa)
How you get all this money

PA

dollars all tol Shucked out seventy-
five for this truck but we still

TOM

hood)
Shell probly ride like a bull calf--

but shell ride

PA
Reckon we better begin roustin ‘em
out if we aim to get outa here by
daylight How about it John How
you boys comin
(He casts a critical
eye over the truck)

INSIDE THE CABIN Ma sits on a box in front of the stove

The fire door is open and the light shines out The room
itself has been pretty well stripped with only trash and
discarded things left In Mas lap is a pasteboard shoebox
and she is going through the meager treasures stored in it
to see what must go and what she can take with her Her eyes
are soft and thoughtful as each item brings a memory but
not sad Occasionally she smiles faintly She pulls out a
letter looks at it starts to throw it into the fire then
puts it back in the box Her hand pulls out a PICTURE
POSTCARD We see it in Mas hand It is a picture of the
Statue Of Liberty Over it Greetings from New York City

She turns it over It is addressed Mrs Joad RFD 254
Oklahomy Territory In the space for a message Hello honey

Willy Mae

MA after a moment of studying it throws the card into the
fire She lifts the letter again puts it back She pulls
out a worn NEWSPAPER CLIPPING We see it in Mas hand The
headline is JOAD GETS SEVEN YEARS

MA drops the clipping into the fire Rummaging around she
pulls out a small CHINA DOG We see it closely as before

On it is printed Souvenir of Louisiana Purchase Exposition--
St Louis--1904

MA studies the dog smiling remembering something that it
meant in her life Then she puts in in a pocket in her dress

( )

Next she pulls out some pieces of cheap jewelry one cuff
link a babys signet ring two earrings She smiles at the
ring then pockets it The cuff link too The earrings she
holds for a moment longer then looks around to make sure
nobody sees then holds them to her ears not looking into
any kind of a mirror just feeling them against the lobes of
her ears as once perhaps she wore them Her eyes are grave

TOM
(from the door)
How about it Ma

MA
Im ready

Tom disappears Ma looks at the earrings and then at the
contents of the box She lifts out the letter again and looks
at it Then without drama she drops it into the fire She
watches it burn Her eyes are still on the flame as she calls

MA
Rosasharn honey Wake up the chillun
Were fixin to leave

The flame dies down

In the BACKYARD it is grey dawn There is a thrill of quiet
excitement as they all stand around the loaded truck hats
on putting on coats The ones missing are Ma Rosasharn
the children and Grampa Pa is in charge

PA
(as Ma comes out of
the cabin)
Wheres Grampa Al go git him

GRANMA
(trying to climb in
the front seat)

Tom easily lifts her up the step The two children come
running out of the house chanting

RUTHIE AND WINFIELD

GRAMPAS VOICE

All turn In a CORNER OF THE HOUSE Al is pulling Grampa gently
but firmly the old man holding back and furious He flails
feebly at Al who holds his head out of the way without
effort

AL
He wasnt sleepin He was settin
out back a the barn Theys somepin
wrong with him

GRAMPA
Ef you dont let me go--

Al permits Grampa to jerk loose and sit down on the doorstep

( )

The old man is miserable and frightened and angry too old
to understand or accept such a violent change in his life

Tom and Pa come up to him The others watch solemnly from
their places in the truck

TOM
Whats the matter Grampa

GRAMPA
(dully sullenly)
Aint nothin the matter I just

(after a pause)
--but its mine

TOM
(after a silence)

cabin with him)

Grampa his eyes hurt and hunted and frightened and
bewildered scratches in the dirt

GRAMPA
(loudly)
And cant nobody make me go either
Aint nobody here man enough to make

All watch him worriedly
INSIDE THE CABIN

TOM
Either we got to tie him up and throw

(after thought)
Reckon we could git him drunk

TOM

TOM

PA
(watching)

Ma is already pouring coffee into a can as GRAMPA is seen

GRAMPA

(mumbling defiantly)
If Muley can scrabble along I can

(Suddenly sniffing)

GRAMPA

He drinks the coffee Pa and Tom watch him He notices
nothing He takes another dram of the coffee

GRAMPA

(amiably)
I shore do like spareribs

( )

He drinks again

The scene dissolves to the TRUCK It is just after dawn Pa
Tom and Noah are lifting Grampa into the truck He mumbles
angrily but is unconscious of what is happening

PA
(fretfully)
Easy easy You wanta bust his head
wide open Pull his arms John

GRAMPA
(mumbling)
Aint a-goin thas all

PA
Put somepin over him so he wont

(Looking around)

(A chorus of responses)
Awright Al letta go

The engine rattles and roars shakily Grinning with
excitement Pa sits down and pats Grampa clumsily

PA
You be awright Grampa

The truck starts to move heavily Casy stands watching it

CASY
Good-by an good luck

PA
Hey wait Hold ‘er Al
(the car stops)
Aint you goin with us

CASY
(after a pause)
Id like to Theres somethin
happenin out there in the wes an
Id like to try to learn what it is
If you feel you got the room

He stops politely Pa looks from one face to the other in
the truck--a swift silent canvass--and though no one speaks
or gives any other sign Pa knows that the vote is yes

PA

(heartily)
Come on get on plenty room

( )

OMNES
Sure come on Casy plenty room

Quickly he climbs aboard The truck rattles into motion again

PA
(excitedly)
Here we go

TOM
(grinning)
California here we come

As they all look back the deserted CABIN is seen from the
departing truck

Now we see the FAMILY IN THE TRUCK as it snorts and rattles
toward the road--a study of facial expressions as the Joad
family look back for the last time at their home Connie and
Rosasharn whispering giggling and slappings are
oblivious of the event Ruthie and Winfield are trembling
with excitement But Toms and Pas smiles have disappeared
and all the men are gazing back thoughtfully and soberly
their minds occupied with the solemnity of this great
adventure

In the FRONT SEAT OF THE TRUCK Al is driving Granma is
already dozing Ma looks steadily ahead

AL
(grinning)
Aint you gonna look back Ma--give
the ol place a last look

MA
(coldly shaking her
head)
Were goin to California aint we
Awright then lets go to California

AL
(sobering)
That dont sound like you Ma You
never was like that before

MA
I never had my house pushed over
before I never had my fambly stuck
out on the road I never had to
lose everthing I had in life

She continues to stare straight ahead The TRUCK is lumbering
up onto a paved highway

The scene dissolves to a MONTAGE Almost filling the screen
is the shield marker of the US Highway 66 Superimposed on
it is a montage of jalopies steaming and rattling and piled
high with goods and people as they pull onto the highway
to indicate as much as possible that this departure of the
Joad family is but part of a mass movement of jalopies and
families The signs of towns on US Highway 66 flash past--
CHECOTAH OKLAHOMA CITY BETHANY

This dissolves to a HIGHWAY It is late afternoon The Joad
truck pulls of the paved highway and stops The men leap

down quickly from the truck all but Pa who lifts Grampa in
his arms and then lowers him slowly gently into Toms arms

In TOMS arms Grampa is whimpering feebly

GRAMPA
Aint a-goin aint a-goin

TOM
S all right Grampa You just kind
a tard thats all Somebody fix a
pallet

With a quilt pulled from the truck Ma runs ahead as Tom
carries Grampa toward a clump of woods back off the highway

The others get down soberly from the truck all but Granma
who is dozing Cars pass-a fast car passing a jalopy Tom is
letting the old man down gently as Ma adjusts the quilt on
the ground Death is in Grampas eyes as he looks up dimly
at them

GRAMPA
(a whisper)
Thas it jus tard thas all jus
tard
(He closes his eyes)

The scene dissolves to an insert of a NOTE It is written
awkwardly in pencil on the flyleaf of a Bible Toms voice
recites the words

TOMS VOICE
This here is William James Joad
dyed of a stroke old old man His
folkes bured him becaws they got no
money to pay for funerls Nobody
kilt him Jus a stroke an he dyed

A GRAVE at night In the clump of woods lighted by two
lanterns The Joad tribe stands reverently around an open
grave Having read the note Tom puts it in a small fruit
jar and kneels down and reaching into the grave places it
on Grampas body

TOM

I figger best we leave something
like this on him lest somebody dig
him up and make out he been kilt

(Reaching into the

grave)
Lotta times looks like the govment
got more interest in a dead man than
a live one

PA
Not be so lonesome either knowin
his name is there with im not just
a old fella lonesome underground

TOM
(straightening up)
Casy wont you say a few words

CASY
I aint no more a preacher you know

TOM
We know But aint none of our folks
ever been buried without a few words

CASY

(after a pause)
Ill say em--an make it short

(All bow and close

eyes)
This here ol man jus lived a life
an jus died out of it I dont
know whether he was good or bad an
it dont matter much Heard a fella
say a poem once an he says All
that lives is holy But I wouldnt
pray for jus a ol man thats dead
because hes awright If I was to
pray Id pray for the folks thats
alive an dont know which way to
turn Grampa here he aint got no
more trouble like that Hes got his
job all cut out for im--so cover
‘im up and let im get to it

( )

OMNES
Amen

The scene fades out
HIGHWAY 66 in daylight fades in an Oklahoma stretch
revealing a number of jalopies rattling westward The Joad

truck approaches

In the FRONT SEAT OF THE TRUCK Tom is now driving Granma is
dozing again and Ma is looking thoughtfully ahead

MA
Tommy

TOMMY
What is it Ma

MA
Wasnt that the state line we just
passed

TOM

(after a pause)
Yesm that was it

MA
Your pa tol me you didnt ought to
cross it if youre paroled Says

TOM
Forget it Ma I got her figgered
out Long as I keep outa trouble
aint nobody gonna say a thing All
I gotta do is keep my nose clean

MA
(worriedly)
Maybe they got crimes in California
we dont know about Crimes we dont
even know is crimes

TOM
(laughing)
Forget it Ma Jus think about the
nice things out there Think about
them grapes and oranges--an ever body
got work--

GRANMA

(waking suddenly)
I gotta git out

( )

TOM
First gas station Granma--

GRANMA
I gotta git out I tell ya I gotta
git out

TOM
(foot on brakes)
Awright Awright

As the truck slows to a stop a motorcycle cop approaches
after them Looking back Tom sees him bearing toward them

He looks grimly at Ma

TOM
They shore dont waste no time
(As Granma whines)
Take her out

COP
(astraddle his
motorcycle)
Save your strength lady
(to Tom)
Get goin buddy No campin here

TOM
(relieved)
We aint campin We jus stoppin a
minute--

COP
Lissen I heard that before--

GRANMA
I tell ya I gotta git out

The cop looks startled puzzled but Tom shrugs a disclaimer
for responsibility in that quarter

TOM
(mildly)
Shes kinda ol--

GRANMA
(whimpering)
I tell ya--

COP
Okay okay

( )

GRANMA
(triumphantly)
Puh-raise the Lawd for vittory

As Ma helps Granma out the other side Tom and the cop
exchange a glance and another shrug at the foibles of women
and then look studiedly into space

The scene dissolves to a MONTAGE superimposed on the marker
of US Highway 66 an assortment of roadside signs flashes
by Bar-B-Q Joes Eats Dr Pepper Gas Coca Cola This
Highway is Patrolled End of 25 Mile Zone Lucky Strikes
Used Cars Nutburger Motel Drive-Inn Free Water We Fix
Flats etc

A HAND-PAINTED SIGN reads CAMP 50 It is night We hear
the sound of guitar music In the CAMP GROUND a small wooden
house dominates the scene There are no facilities the
migrants simply pitch makeshift tents and park their
jalopies wherever there is a space It is after supper and a
dozen or more men sit on the steps of the house listening to
Connie play a road song on a borrowed guitar The music
softens the tired drawn faces of the men and drives away
some of their shyness In the dark outside the circle of
light from the gasoline lantern on the porch some of the
women and children sit and enjoy the luxury of this relative
gaiety The proprietor sits tipped back in a straight chair
on the porch

We see the JOAD TENT Behind their truck a tarpaulin is
stretched over a rope from tree to tree Granma lies asleep
on a quilt stirring fitfully Ma sits on the ground at her
head fanning her with a piece of cardboard Rosasharn lies
flat on her back hands clasped under her head looking up
at the stars The music comes to them pleasantly

ROSASHARN
Ma all this will it hurt the
baby

MA

Now dont you go gettin nimsy-mimsy

ROSASHARN
Sometimes Im all jumpy inside

MA
Well cant nobody get through nine
months without sorrow

ROSASHARN
But will it--hurt the baby

( )

MA
They use to be a sayin A chile
born outa sorrowll be a happy chile
An another Born outa too much joyll
be a doleful boy Thats the way I
always heard it

ROSASHARN
You dont ever get scairt do you
Ma
MA
(thoughtfully)

Sometimes A little Only it aint
scairt so much Its just waitin
an wonderin But when sumpn happens
that I got to do sumpn--

(simply)
--Ill do it

ROSASHARN
Dont it ever scare you it wont be
nice in California like we think

MA

(quickly)
No No it dont I cant do that I
cant let mself All I can do is
see how soon they gonna wanta eat
again Theyd all get upset if I
done anymore n that They all depen
on me jus thinkin about that

(after a pause)
Thats my part--that an keepin the
fambly together

As the music ends we see a GROUP ON THE PORCH STEPS The men
murmur approbation of Connies playing

PA
(with quiet pride)
Thas my son-in-law

FIRST MAN

PA

As they talk a SECOND MAN standing on the edge of the group
begins to grin bitterly He is much more ragged than the
others

SECOND MAN

The GROUP turns to look at the Man

PA
(with dignity)
No we aint got no money But theys

The Man begins to snigger and then to laugh in a high
whinneying giggle which turns into a fit of coughing All of
the men are watching him

SECOND MAN

SECOND MAN

(With wild bitterness)
Heart-failure--an their little
bellies stuck out like a pig-bladder

He looks around at the men trying to control his emotions
and then he walks away into the darkness There is an uneasy
silence

FIRST MAN
Well--gettin late Got to get to
sleep

They all rise as at a signal all moved and worried by the

Second Mans outburst TOM PA AND CASY move away worry on
their faces

( )

PA

CASY

PA
(worriedly)
How can you tell

The scene dissolves to a MONTAGE superimposed on the shield
marker of US Highway 66 and the rattling Joad truck the
signs of towns flash by AMARILLO VEGA GLENRIO

The TRUCK is seen on the HIGHWAY It is now mountain country--
New Mexico Then it is seen at a GAS STATION It is a cheap
two-pump station hand-painted dreary dusty Huddled next
to it is a hamburger stand In front of the hamburger stand
is a truck labeled NEW MEXICO VAN AND STORAGE COMPANY The
Joads are piling out of their truck Directed by Ma Noah
lifts Granma out The two children scamper around shrieking
because their legs have gone to sleep Al is preparing to
put water in the radiator Pa takes out a deep leather
pouch unties the strings and begins calculating his money
as the fat proprietor advances

FAT MAN

Mae shrugs at the truck drivers to indicate what shes up
against while Bert mashes his hamburgers savagely with the
spatula

MAE
Come in

Pa and the two children come in as Mae opens a drawer and
pulls out a long waxpaper-covered loaf of bread The children
have been drawn to the candy showcase and are staring in at
the goodies

MAE

( )

PA

Taking out his pouch Pa digs into it feels around with his
fingers for a dime as he apologizes

PA

But when he puts the dime down on the counter he has a penny
with it He is about to drop this back in the pouch when his
eyes fall on the children staring at the candy Slowly he
moves down to see what they are looking at Then

PA
Is them penny candy maam

The children look up with a gasp their big eyes on Mae as
she moves down behind the counter

MAE
Which ones

PA
There them stripy ones

Mae looks from the candy to the children They have stopped
breathing their eyes on the candy

( )

MAE
Oh them Well no--thems two for a
penny
PA

Well give me two then maam

He places the penny carefully on the counter and Mae holds
the sticks of candy out to the children They look up at Pa

PA
(beaming)
Sure take em take

em

Rigid with embarrassment they accept the candy looking
neither at it nor at each other Pa picks up the loaf of
bread and they scramble for the door At the door Pa turns
back

PA
Thank you maam

The door slams Bill turns back from staring after them

BILL
Them wasnt two-for-a-cent candy

MAE
(belligerently)
Whats it to you

BILL
Them was nickel apiece candy

FRED

Both reach in their pockets but when Fred sees what Bill
has put down he reaches again and duplicates it As they go
out of the door

BILL
So long

MAE
Hey wait a minute You got change
comin

BILLS VOICE
(from outside)
Whats it to you

( )

As Mae watches them through the window her eyes warm Bert
walks around the counter to the three slot machines a paper
with figures on it in his hand The truck roars outside and
moves off Mae looks down again at the coins

MAE
(softly)
Bert

BERT
(playing a machine)
What ya want

MAE
Look here

As he looks we see the COINS ON THE COUNTER They are two
half-dollars

MAE
(reverently)
Truck drivers

There is a rattle of coins as Bert hits the jackpot In his
left hand on the machine is a paper with three columns of
figures on it The third column is much the longest He scoops
out the money

BERT
I figgered No 3 was about ready to
pay off

The scene fades out

The ARIZONA BORDER in daylight fades in It is in a gap in
the mountains and beyond can be seen the Painted Desert A
border guard halts the Joad truck He is not as tough as his
words indicate just curt and matter-of-fact

GUARD
Where you going
TOM
(who is driving)
California

GUARD
How long you plan to be in Arizona

TOM
No longern we can get acrost her

( )

GUARD
Got any plants
TOM
No plants
GUARD
(putting sticker on
windshield)
Okay Go ahead but you better keep
movin
TOM

Sure We aim to
The truck rattles into movement

The scene dissolves to a MONTAGE superimposed on the shield
marker of US Highway 66 and the Joad truck Signs flash
by FLAGSTAFF WATER 5 A GAL WATER 10 A GAL WATER 15 A
GAL and finally NEEDLES CALIF

In the foreground their backs turned the Joads stand on
and about their truck looking in a long silence at what can
be seen of California from Needles Their silence is
eloquent

The faces of the Joads are blank with dismay for this is an
unattractive sight indeed

PA
(finally)
There she is folks--the land a milk
an honey--California

CONNIE
(sullenly)
Well if thats what we come out
here for

They look at each other in disappointment

ROSASHARN
(timidly to Connie)
Maybe its nice on the other side
Them pitchers--them little poscards--
they was real pretty

TOM
(rallying them)
Aw sure This heres jus a part of
it Aint no sense a gettin scairt
right off

( )

PA
Course not Come on lets get goin
She dont look so tough to me

The Joads and the landscape are seen again Then the scene
dissolves to the BANK OF A RIVER The camp at Needles is on
the bank of the Colorado River among some willows We see
the man of the family sitting chest-deep in the shallow
waters talking occasionally ducking their heads under
reveling in this relief In the background are the towering
mountains

TOM
Got that desert yet Gotta take her
tonight Take her in the daytime
fella says shell cut your gizzard

out
PA
(to Al)
Hows Granma since we got her in the
tent
AL

(lazily after a

silence)
Like to jus stay here myself Like

all life long lazy as a brood sow
in the mud

( )

They look

TOM

(looking up at the

mountains )
Never seen such tough mountains
This heres a murder country just

(Thoughtfully)
Wonder if well ever get in a place
where folks can live thout fightin
hard scrabble an rock Sometimes
you get to thinkin they aint no

up as a man and his grown son stand on the bank

MAN

MAN

TOM

They start to shuck off their clothes THE MAN

PA

TOM

MANS VOICE
Panhandle come from near Pampa

PA
(in surprise)
Can you make a livin there

MANS VOICE
Nope

The man and his son sit down in the water

excluding

( )

MAN
(continuing)
But at leas we can starve to death
with folks we know

There is a long silence among the Joads as the man and his
son splash water over their heads

PA
(slowly)
Ya know youre the second fella
talked like that Id like to hear
some more about that

TOM
Me an you both

The man and his son exchange a glance as though the Joads
had touched on the deadliest of subjects

SON
(finally)
He aint gonna tell you nothin about

PA

If a fellas willin to work hard

MAN
Listen mister I dont know

(Sullenly)

But a fella dont know everthing

There is a disturbed silence as the Joads study the man but
he obviously has no intention of saying anything more Finally
Pa turns to his brother

PA
John you never was a fella to say

( )

The scene

dont get a job well set on our
behins Thats all they is to it

TOM
(laughing)
Uncle John dont talk much but when

(He spurts water out
of his mouth)

dissolves to a GAS STATION at night The Joad

truck loaded with goods and people is last gas and

servicing

before the desert Two white uniformed boys handle

the station A sign reads LAST CHANCE FOR GAS AND WATER
Al is filling the radiator Tom is counting out the money
for the gas

( )

TOM
(laughing)

(He climbs into the
drivers seat)

MA AND GRANMA are seen lying on a mattress in the TRUCK

Granmas eyes are shut Actually she is near death Ma keeps
patting her

MA
(softly)
Dont you worry Granma Its gonna
be awright
GRANMA
(mumbling)
Grampa Grampa I want Grampa
MA

The truck moves off
We see the GAS STATION again with the truck pulling away
The First Boy a lad who knows everything stands looking

after them shaking his head His assistant is cleaning up
the pumps

FIRST BOY

SECOND BOY

being couldnt stand it to be so
miserable

( )

FIRST BOY
Just dont know any better I guess

NOAH is seen hiding behind a corner of the GAS STATION

Peering out he sees that the truck has gone He turns to
walk away into the darkness

The scene dissolves to a RIVER BANK at night and Noah is
once more seated in the shallow water splashing looking up
at the mountains content

The TRUCK is rattling along US Highway 66 across the
desert in the night In the DRIVERS SEAT Tom is driving
Al and Pa are by his side

AL
What a place Howd you like to walk
acrost her

TOM
People done it If they could we

AL

TOM
(after a pause)
Well we aint out a it yet

RUTHIE AND WINFIELD huddle together in THE TRUCK eyes wide
with excitement

RUTHIE

WINFIELD
(trying to see)

RUTHIE

RUTHIE

MA AND GRANDMA are seen again The old woman lies still
breathing noisily Ma continues to pat her

MA
(whispering)
S awright honey Everythings gonna

Then we see the TRUCK still churning along Highway 66 by
night CASY is asleep in the truck his face wet with sweat

CONNIE AND ROSASHARN are huddled together damp and weary

ROSASHARN
Seems like we wasnt never gonna do
nothin but move Im so tard

CONNIE
(sullenly)

ROSASHARN
(fearfully)
You aint--you aint sorry are you

ROSASHARN
(pleadingly)
But we can still do it honey

CONNIE
(sullenly)

Her eyes widen with fright as he avoids meeting her glance
MA AND GRANDMA lie side by side Mas hand is on Grandmas

heart The old womans eyes are shut and her breathing is
almost imperceptible

( )

MA
(whispering)
We cant give up honey The familys
got to get acrost You know that

JOHNS VOICE
Everthing all right

Ma does not answer immediately Her head lifted she is
staring at Granmas face Then slowly she withdraws her hand
from Grandmas heart

MA
(slowly)
Yes everthings all right I--I
guess I dropped off to sleep

Her head rests again She lies looking fixedly at the still
face

The scene dissolves to an INSPECTION STATION near Daggett
California at night Obeying a sign that reads KEEP RIGHT
AND STOP the Joad truck pulls up under a long shed as two
officers yawning come out to inspect it One takes down
the license number and opens the hood The people aboard the
truck bestir themselves sleepily

TOM
Whats this here

OFFICER
Agricultural inspection We got to
go over your stuff Got any vegetables
or seed

TOM

OFFICER
Well we got to look over your stuff
You got to unload

MA gets down off the truck her face swollen her eyes hard
There is an undercurrent of hysteria in her voice and manner

MA
Look mister We got a sick ol lady
We got to get her to a doctor We

(Almost hysterically)
You cant make us wait

( )

OFFICER
Yeah Well we got to look you over

MA

(Pulling him to the
truck)
Look

The officer lights his flashlight on Granmas face

OFFICER
(shocked)
You wasnt foolin You swear you

MA
No I swear it

OFFICER
Then go ahead You can get a doctor
at Barstow Thats just eight miles
But dont stop Dont get off
Understand

Ma climbs back up beside Granma

TOM
Okay cap Much oblige

The truck starts

MA
(to John)
Tell Tom he dont have to stop
Granmas all right

The TRUCK moves away on Highway 66

The scene dissolves to the TEHACHAPI VALLEY by day Taking
it from the book there is a breath-taking view of the
valley from where Highway 66 comes out of the mountains
This is the California the Joads have dreamed of rich and
beautiful the land of milk and honey It is just daybreak
with the sun at the Joads back They have pulled off the
side of the road and stopped just to drink in the sight
They are looking almost reverently at the sight before them
as they climb stiffly out of the truck

AL
Will ya look at her

( )

PA
(shaking his head)
I never knowed they was anything
like her

One by one they climb down

TOM
Wheres Ma I want Ma to see it
Look Ma Come here Ma

He starts back MA is holding to the rear of the truck her
face stiff and swollen her eyes deep-sunk her limbs weak
and shaky

TOM
(shocked)
Ma you sick

MA
(hoarsely )
Ya say were acrost

TOM
(eagerly)
Look Ma

MA

(Her knees buckle and
she sits down on the
running board)

TOM

TOM

MA
(after a pause)
Granmas dead

TOM

(shocked)

(nodding)

I was afraid theyd stop us an
wouldnt let us cross But I tol’
Granma I tol her when she was dyin’

no chances on bein stopped

With the valley for background Ma looks down on it

MA

(softly)
So its all right At leas shell
get buried in a nice green place
Trees and flowers aroun’

(Smiling sadly)
She got to lay her head down in
California after all

The scene fades out

A TOWN STREET by day fades in Down a town or small city
business street with quite a bit of traffic comes the Joad
truck being pushed by the Joad men At the wheel aiming at
a corner gas station is Rosasharn frightened and
uncertain with Ma beside her on the front seat In the back
Ruthie and Winfield are delighted with this new form of
locomotion

Crossing the street a policeman falls into step with Tom

POLICEMAN
How far you figger you gonna get this
way

TOM

Right here We give out a gas
Wheres the bes place to get some
work aroun here

(pulling out the

handbill)
Dont matter what kin either

(stopping her wearily)

Okay maam lets dont go into it

POLICEMAN

(about to leave)
Pop that just aint up to me

(Grimly he points to

the handbill)
But I dont min tellin you the
guy they ought to lock up is the guy
that sent out them things

( )

He strolls away the Joads looking concernedly after him
just as the gas station attendant comes briskly to them after
disposing of the other car

ATTENDANT
(brightly)
How many folks

AL
(after a pause)
One

The attendant regards him in disgust

The scene dissolves to HOOVERVILLE by day A large migrant
camp a typical shanty town of ragged tents and tarpaper
shacks jalopies and dirty children A dozen or more children
pause to watch as the Joad truck lumbers down a dirt incline
from the road and stops at the edge of the camp in front of
one of the most miserable of the shacks The Joads regard

the camp with dismay

TOM
(shaking his head)
She shore dont look prosperous
Want to go somewheres else

MA
On a gallon a gas
(as Tom grins at her)
Lets set up the tent Maybe I can
fix us up some stew

The truck moves into the camp through a lane of children

The scene dissolves to the JOAD TENT In front of it Ma is
on her knees feeding a small fire with broken sticks On the
fire is a pot of stew Ruthie and Winfield stand watching

the pot About fifteen ragged barefooted children in a half-
circle are now around the fire their solemn eyes on the pot
of stew Occasionally they look at Ma then back at the

stew

Presently one of the older girls speaks

GIRL
(shyly)
I could break up some bresh if you
want me maam

MA

(gently)
You want to get ast to eat hunh

( )

GIRL
(simply)
Yes maam

MA

( )

MA

(to Ruthie)

(looking helplessly

at the children)
I dunno what to do I got to feed
the fambly Whatm I gonna do with

She is dishing the stew into tin plates The childrens eyes
follow the spoon and then the first plate to John He is
raising the first spoonful to his mouth when he notices them
apparently for the first time He is chewing slowly his
eyes on the children their eyes on his face when Tom and
Al enter

JOHN
(standing up)

(Handing plate to Tom)

TOM

JOHN

TOM
(to the children)

The children retreat a step but no more and then look
wonderingly at him

MA

( )

MA (CONTD)
(smiling to the
children)

Look You little fellas go an get

But they aint to be no fightin

(dishing plates for

Ruthie and Winfield)
I dont know if Im doin right or
not but--go inside everbody stay
inside

(the children are

back)
They aint enough All you gonna get
is jus a taste but--I cant help
it I cant keep it from you

She goes in the tent hurriedly to hide the fact that tears
have come into her eyes The children pounce on the pot
silently too busy digging for the stew to speak

INSIDE THE TENT they have all finished their stew already

MA
(bitterly)
I done fine Now nobody got enough

At the ROAD a new coupe drives off the highway and into the
camp and stops It contains two men One gets out

A GROUP OF MEN are squatting in a half-circle the usual
pattern for conversation but they are silent now as their
eyes fix on the man approaching He is a labor agent

OUTSIDE THE JOAD TENT the men are looking in the direction
of the group They start to walk toward it

AT THE GROUP OF MEN The agent wearing a flat-—brimmed
Stetson and with his pockets filled with pencils and dog-
eared booklets looks down at the silent men All of the men
in the camp are approaching slowly silently The women give
their anxious attention in the background Among the men who
walk up is FLOYD a grimly disappointed young man

AGENT
You men want to work

PA

( )

AGENT
Tulare County Fruits opening up
Need a lot of pickers

FLOYD

AGENT

FIRST MAN

FLOYD
(quietly)
All right mister Ill go You just

AGENT
(ominously)

FLOYD

(pulling out a handbill)
you aint one a the guys that sent
these things out

AGENT
(tough)
Listen Smart Guy Ill run my
business my own way I got work If
you wanta take it okay If not
just sit here thats all

( )

The squatting men have risen one by one Their faces are

expressionless because they simply dont know when one of
these calls is genuine or when it isnt Floyd addresses

them

FLOYD

Twicet now Ive fell for that line
Maybe he needs a thousan men So he
gets five thousan there an hell
pay fifteen cents a hour An you
guysll have to take it ‘cause youll
be hungry

(facing the agent)
F he wants to hire men let him
write it out an say what hes gonna
pay Ast to see his license He aint
allowed by law to contrack men without
a license

AGENT
(turning)
Joe

The other man gets out of the COUPE He wears riding breeches
and laced boots carries a pistol and cartridge belt and
there is a deputy sheriffs star on his brown shirt He smiles
thinly and shifts his pistol holster as he starts toward the
group THE MEN are watching the deputy approach

FLOYD
(angrily)
You see If this guy was on the level
would he bring a cop along

DEPUTY
(entering)
Whats the trouble

AGENT
(pointing at Floyd)
Ever see this guy before

DEPUTY
Whatd he do

AGENT

DEPUTY
Hmmm
(MORE )

( )

DEPUTY (CONTD)

(giving Floyd a looking

over)
Seems like I have Seems like I seen

(sharply)
Get in that car

TOM

DEPUTY
Open your trap again and youll go

AGENT

(to the men)
You fellas dont wanta lissen to
troublemakers You better pack up

The men say nothing

DEPUTY

Might be a good idea to do what he
says Too many of you Okies aroun
here already Folks beginnin to
figger it aint maybe safe Might
start a epidemic or sumpn

(after a pause)
Wouldnt like a bunch a guys down
here with pick handles tonight would
you

As the agent gets into the coupe FLOYDS thumbs hook over
his belt and he looks off away TOMS look away is an answer

His thumbs also hook over his belt

DEPUTY
(to Floyd)
Now you

He takes hold of Floyds left arm At the same time Floyd
swings smacks him in the face As the deputy staggers Tom
sticks out a foot and trips him Floyd is already running
through the camp The deputy fires from the ground There is
a scream A WOMAN is looking down at her hand the knuckles
shot away

The COUPE is seen as the agent steps on the gas to get away

( )

As Floyd gets in the clear the DEPUTY sitting on the ground
aims his pistol again slowly carefully Behind him Casy
steps up gauges his distance and then kicks him square in
the base of the skull The deputy tumbles over unconscious

Tom picks up the pistol

CASY
Gimme that gun Now git outa here

Go down in them willows an wait

TOM
(angrily)
I aint gonna run

CASY
He seen you Tom You wanta be
fingerprinted You wanta get sent
back for breakin parole

TOM
Youre right

CASY
Hide in the willows If its awright
to come back Ill give you four high
whistles

As Tom strides away there is the distant sound of a siren
Casy empties the gun and throws cartridges and gun aside

The men aghast have been standing back worried and excited
and apprehensive They wish nothing like this had happened

The women have gathered around the wounded woman who is
sobbing Now at the sound of the siren everybody begins to
move uncomfortably toward his tent or shack Al looks
admiringly from Casy to the unconscious deputy

Everybody has disappeared into his tent but Al and Casy The
siren draws nearer

CASY
Go on Get in your tent You dont
know nothin

AL
How ‘bout you

( )

CASY
(grinning)
Somebody got to take the blame
They just got to hang it on somebody
you know

(Shrugging)
An I aint doin nothin but set
around

AL
But aint no reason--

CASY
(savagely)
Lissen I dont care nothin about
you but if you mess in this your
whole fambly lible to get in trouble
an Tom get sent back to the
penitentiary

AL
Okay I think youre a darn fool
though

CASY
Sure Why not

Al heads for the Joad tent and Casy kneels down and lifts
the deputy He wipes his face clean The deputy begins to
come to An open car curves off the highway stops in the
clearing and four men with rifles pile out The deputy sits
rubbing his eyes and Casy stands

SECOND DEPUTY
Whats goin on here

CASY
This man a yours he got tough an I
hit him Then he started shootin--
hit a woman down the line--so I hit
him again

SECOND DEPUTY
Well--whatd you do in the first
place

CASY
I talked back

Two of the men have helped the deputy to his feet He feels
the back of his neck gingerly

( )

CASY
Theys a woman down there like to
bleed to death from his bad shootin

SECOND DEPUTY
(to assistant)
Take a look at her
(to Deputy)
Mike is this the fella that hit
you

DEPUTY
(dazedly)
Dont look like him

CASY
It was me all right You just got
smart with the wrong fella

DEPUTY
(shuddering)
Dont look like him but maybe it
was I aint sure

SECOND DEPUTY
Get in that car

With a deputy on either side of him Casy climbs in the back
seat The sickish deputy is helped into the car The other
man comes running back

MAN
(proudly)
Boy what a mess a 45 does make
They got a tourniquet on Well send
a doctor out

The car starts CASY and two deputies beside him are revealed
in the back seat Casy sits proudly head up eyes front On
his lips is a faint smile on his face a curious look of
conquest

DEPUTY
(angry at the whole
business)
But what you gonna do Must be
thousands of em around here sore
and hungry and living in them dumps
What you gonna do about ‘em

( )

SECOND DEPUTY
You gotta hold ‘em down Hold ‘em
down or theyll take over the whole
country Thats all you can do

DEPUTY
(grimly)
Well they aint gonna take over my
country I been livin here too long
for that Maybe some a the boys better
drop around tonight and give ‘em
something to think about

Casy sits with eyes front AT THE WILLOWS screened by trees
or brush Tom looks off at the car taking Casy away Starting
at a sound he withdraws into the brush as the scene
dissolves

IN FRONT OF THE JOAD TENT at night Ma stands facing Pa and
Al Rosasharn lies on a pallet her face in her arms while
Ruthie and Winfield look on wide-eyed at the family
quarrel

PA
(to Ma)
Leave him alone Ma--Als just billy-
goatin around--

AL

MA
You dont know no girls around here

They stand staring at each other in silence

At the EDGE OF HOOVERVILLE Tom is heading for the Joad tent
warily glancing around constantly but not running for
that would draw attention to him

IN FRONT OF THE JOAD TENT again

PA
(helplessly)

As she gets ready for whatever IN THE SHADOWS twenty
feet away from the tent Tom whistles softly

TOM

darkness )

There is a silence that stops Tom in his rush of preparation

MA

(angrily)

ROSASHARN
(uncovering her face)
Tom I jus dont feel like nothin

TOM
Maybe hell be back Well leave

(He pats her awkwardly)

The scene dissolves to HOOVERVILLE at night The jalopies
are lumbering up on the road one after the other as the
migrants scatter before the

TOM
Threatened invasion

IN THE JOAD TRUCK Tom is helping Rosasharn into the front
seat beside Ma The others are aboard except Al Tom hands
Al a wrench

TOM
Just in case Sit up back an if
anybody tries to climb up--let ‘im
have it

PA
(from truck)
I aint got nothin in my han’

TOM
(to Al)

(He gets into the
drivers seat and
starts the truck)

In the FRONT SEAT of the truck Tom drives Ma sits in the
middle Rosasharn on the other side

ROSASHARN
(hopefully)
Maybe Connie went to get some books
to study up with Hes gonna be a
radio expert ya know Maybe he
figgered to suprise us

( )

MA
You promised Tommy

TOM
Im a-tryin Ma Honest I am

MA
You gotta keep clear Tom The
famblys breakin up You got to

TOM
Whats that--detour

As he slows down the truck we see that half of the ROAD is
blocked with boards and red lanterns a group of men swarm
around the Joad truck as it stops A leader leans in Toms

window

LEADER
Where you think youre goin

In the FRONT SEAT of the truck Toms hand reaches for the

jack-handle on the seat at his side but Mas hand clutches
his arm in a steel grip

Toms arm
on tight

TOM
Well--
(then in a servile
whine)
were strangers here We heard
about theys work in a place called
Tulare

LEADER
Well youre goin the wrong way
an whats more we dont want no
more Okies in this town We aint
got work enough for them that are

trembles as he tries to pull it away but Ma holds
TOM

Which way is it at mister

( )

LEADER
You turn right aroun and head north
An dont come back till the cottons
ready

TOM
Yes sir

The TRUCK turns around In the FRONT SEAT Tom is almost
sobbing with anger as he maneuvers the truck around

MA
(whispering)
Dont you min Tommy You done good
You done jus good

The TRUCK is going back down the road as the scene fades
out

A MONTAGE fades in superimposed on growing fields hand-made
signs flash by NO HELP WANTED KEEP OUT--THIS MEANS U NO
WORK NO HELP WANTED

Then we see the JOAD TRUCK pulled up off the paved highway
and jacked up while Tom and Al fix a puncture Ma is seated
in the front seat with Rosasharn Pa and Uncle John are
puttering about worriedly

MA

(thoughtfully)
Sumpn got to happen soon We got
one days more grease two days

(Looking at Rosasharn)
An Rosasharn we got to remember

A BUICK ROADMASTER which has been speeding toward them stops

suddenly Driving it is a husky man named Spencer whose

( )

As they snap into action to get under way again the scene
dissolves to the FRONT SEAT Al driving with Ma and Tom
beside him They are all smiles their faces glowing with
excitement

MA

(excitedly)
Fust thing Ill get is coffee cause

( )

AL

gonna save up an go in town an get

movin pitchers ever night Cowboy
pitchers

The scene dissolves to the ENTRANCE OF THE HOOPER RANCH in
daylight A gravel road leads from the paved highway to the
big wire gates which are enclosed Along the side of the
paved highway are parked a dozen jalopies the migrants
sitting soberly in them Fifty or sixty other migrants line
the gravel road and the junction with the paved highway

Five jalopies are in line waiting to enter the gates And
the scene is overwhelmingly policed There must be ten
motorcycle cops around Six are dismounted and strolling to
keep order among the migrants along the road Three their
motorcycles roaring flank the line of five jalopies As the
Joad truck drives up we see the FRONT SEAT Tom Al and Ma
are beholding the scene with bewilderment

AL
What is it a wreck

COP
(on motorcycle)
Where you think youre going

TOM
Fella named Spencer sent us--said
they was work pickin peaches

COP
Want to work do you

TOM
Sure do

COP
Pull up behind that car
(Calling)
Okay for this one Take em through

TOM
(the truck moving)
Whats the matter Whats happened

COP

Little trouble up ahead but youll
get through Just follow the line

( )

The motorcycle escort forms around the line of six cars and
a deafening din is raised of motorcycles sirens and an
inexplicable blowing of horns on the jalopies At the same
time as the gates open and the six cars start through
flanked by the motorcycle cops the migrants begin spasmodic
shouts but what they say cannot be understood As the cars
move slowly Tom and Al in the FRONT SEAT are puzzled and
worried at the demonstration

AL
Maybe the roads out

TOM
I dont know what these cops got to
do with it but I dont like it
(looking out)
An these here are our own people
all of em I dont like this

AT THE GATES the heckling from the bystanders is spasmodic
not continuous as the six jalopies in line pass through the
gate into the Hooper ranch Two men stand beside the gates
with shotguns They keep calling

MEN
Go on go on Keep movin

The Joad truck passes through the gates IN THE HOOPER RANCH
the six jalopies are halted at the end of a camp street The
houses are small square blocks set in line One a little
larger is a grocery store Casually about are men in pairs
with metal stars on their shirts and shotguns in their hands

Two bookkeepers are already passing down the cars and jotting
down information

BOOKKEEPER

BOOKKEEPER

He moves to the next car The Joad truck starts

AT HOUSE 63 as the Joad truck pulls up two deputies
approach They look closely into each face as the Joads pile
out One of the deputies has a long list in his hand

FIRST DEPUTY

(The deputies walk

away )

( )

TOM
They sure do want to make us feel at
home all right

Ma and Rosasharn step inside the house It is filthy A rusty
tin stove resting on four bricks is all the one room contains

Ma and Rosasharn stand looking around at it Finally

ROSASHARN
We gonna live here

MA
(after a moment)
Why sure It wont be so bad once
we get her washed out

ROSASHARN

MA

OUTSIDE a clerk with glasses appears pushing a cart loaded
with three-gallon buckets

CLERK

MA
(at the door)
Six
(To Tom)

With their buckets they shuffle away toward the peach trees--

Tom Pa Uncle John Al and the two children struggling
with the enormous containers

The scene dissolves to the INTERIOR OF HOUSE 63 at night a
lantern lighting the scene Sitting wherever they can the
Joads have finished their supper of hamburgers And grateful
they are too for the meat

TOM
(wiping his mouth)

MA

TOM
(laughing)
Okay I be back a little later

MA
You be careful Tommy Dont you be
stickin your nose in anything

TOM
(leaving)
Okay Ma Dont you worry

IN THE RANCH STREET There is a faint moonlight but not
much and little sound from the other houses as Tom strolls
down the street

NEAR THE GATE beyond cars pass As Tom approaches the gate
a flashlight plays on his face suddenly and a guard rises
from a box

GUARD
Where you think youre going

TOM
Thought Id take a walk Any law
against it

GUARD
Well you just turn around and walk
the other way

TOM
You mean I cant even get outa here

GUARD
Not tonight you cant Want to walk
back--or you want me to whistle up
some help and take you back

TOM
I11 walk back

The guard watches him as he walks back and then douses his
flashlight

At a SECTION OF WIRE FENCE watching his chance moving
silently Tom drops on the ground on his back gets his
head under the bottom wire and pushes himself under and
outside Rising he crosses the paved highway

AN EMBANKMENT across the road from the wire fence Tom
clambers down it moving quietly He picks his way down the
shallow ravine

A TENT there is a light inside and there are the shadows of
figures In the background beyond the tent is the
silhouette of a small concrete bridge spanning a small
stream Following a trail Tom enters and approaches the
tent (The opening is away from him) IN FRONT OF THE TENT
a man sitting on a box looks up suspiciously as Tom enters
His name is Joe

TOM
Evenin

JOE

TOM

Franks head sticks in the door His voice is an excited
whisper

FRANK
Turn out that light an come outside
Theys sumpn here

Quickly Casy turns the light down and out He gropes for the
door followed by Tom and the other man

IN FRONT OF THE TENT

CASY
(softly)
What is it

FRANK
I dunno Listen

There are night sounds but little else to be distinguished

CASY
Cant tell if you hear it or not
You hear it Tom

TOM
(softly)
I hear it I think theys some guys
comin this way lots of ‘em We
better get outa here

JOE
(whispering)
Down that way--under the bridge span

Casy leads the way softly THE BRIDGE SPAN is seen from the
stream as Casy Tom and the other man wade carefully toward
it

UNDER THE BRIDGE it is almost black as they creep through
the culvert Just as Casy and Tom step out from under the
bridge on the other side a blinding flashlight hits them
lighting them like day

VOICE
There they are Stand where you are

Halted uncertain they stand as three men with stars on
their coats and pickhandles in their hands slide down the
EMBANKMENT Two of them hold lighted flashlights

DEPUTY
Thats him That one in the middle
the skinny one Chuck Alec Here
they are We got ‘em

There are faint responses from a distance CASY AND TOM are
alone The others have fled The deputies approach their
lights on Casy and Tom

CASY
Listen you fellas You dont know
what youre doin Youre helpin to
stave kids

DEPUTY
Shut up you red--

He swings the pickhandle Casy dodges but the stick cracks
his skull He falls face down out of the light The deputies
watch for a moment but Casy doesnt stir

SECOND DEPUTY
Looks like to me you killed him

DEPUTY
Turn him over Put the light on him

Bending over their bodies hide Casy
TOM seen close is breathing hard his eyes glistening

DEPUTYS VOICE
Serves him right too

As the deputies straighten up Tom steps forward grabs the
pickhandle from the man who felled Casy and swings The
blow strikes the deputys arm sending his flashlight flying
and the scene is in semi-darkness as Tom swings again There
is a grunt and a groan as the deputy goes down Then all is
confusion Backing away swinging the pickhandle Tom bolts

( )

splashes a few yards through the stream turns and gains a
better start by throwing the pickhandle at his pursuers

They duck and Tom disappears into the night The other men
rush through the scene in pursuit

THE SECOND DEPUTY is seen bending over the body of the man
Tom laid out

SECOND DEPUTY
Wheres that flash

THIRD DEPUTY
Here

The light flashes on the mans face

THIRD DEPUTY
(awed)
Boy hes good and dead You see
that fella that done it

SECOND DEPUTY
I aint sure--but I caught him one
across the face and believe me I
give him a trade-mark he aint gonna
be able to shake off easy

TOM is seen crashing through the bushes his face bloody
The scene fades out

THE EXTERIOR OF HOUSE 63 fades in It is day Ma comes down
the street with a bundle under her arm and enters the house

INSIDE HOUSE 63 Rosasharn sits by the window as Ma enters

MA
Anybody ask anything

ROSASHARN
Nom

MA

Stand by the door

Rosasharn takes her post at the door as Ma kneels on the
floor beside Tom puts down the rag bundle and gets a basin

Tom who is under a quilt is with his back alone visible

She speaks softly guardedly as she bathes his face

( )

MA

The TRUCK keeps moving along
Then it is night and the TRUCK is still making distance

On a COUNTRY ROAD in grey dawn with a deafening clank
under the hood the Joad truck pulls to a stop off the side
of the road Al is driving Asleep in Toms arm in the front
seat Ma stirs awake as Al turns off the ignition and gets
out He lifts the hood

TOM
Shes hottern a heifer

AL

MA

TOM
Dont know--but its bettern this

As Al starts the truck the scene dissolves to a weather-
beaten wooden sign PERMANENT CAMP NO 9 DEPT OF
AGRICULTURE

We see the GATE TO THE GOVERNMENT CAMP a wide gate ina
high wire fence with a caretakers shack to one side of the
gate The caretaker stands beside his shack as the Joad
truck swings off the road hits an unnoticed rut that
bounces the whole truck off the ground and stops

CARETAKER
(mildly)
You hit ‘er too fast

In the FRONT SEAT Al leans angrily out of the drivers window

Tom is keeping his face away from the caretakers line of
vision

AL
Whats the idea of that

CARETAKER
(chuckling)
Well a lot a kids play in here You
tell folks to go slow and they liable
to forget But let ‘em hit that hump

Al starts climbing out Pa jumps down from the truck

AL

bewilderment Tom climbs out of the truck

TOM
Take ‘er on down Al Ill sign

PA

TOM
Youre tootin were gonna stay
(He follows the
caretaker into the
shack)

INSIDE THE SHACK Tom enters warily alert for any
indication that either his name or his scar may have been
learned and telegraphed here But the caretaker obviously
attaches no significance to either The shack is bare but
for a cot a table a chair and an electric light The
caretaker is seated at the table pen in hand a soiled
ledger open when Tom enters

CARETAKER

Joads descend

AL

CARETAKER

TOM

Goodnight

As he exits we see the GOVERNMENT CAMP with Tom coming out
amazement still on his face As he walks
slowly down the main camp street we share the revelation of

of the shack

the place to him

It is nearly daylight Roosters crow in

the distance The street is neat and orderly in a military
way its cleanliness in sharp contrast to anything he has

known before

Inside the tents people are stirring

In front

of one tent a woman is cooking breakfast A baby is in her

arms

TOM

Good mornin’

WOMAN

Mornin

As he walks on Tom draws a breath of exultation As he
moves on looking around we see the EXTERIOR OF SANITARY
UNIT NO 4 a cheap frame building the purpose of which is
pretty obvious Ruthie warily alert lest she be caught is
peering in the door She looks a long time and then she runs
out of the scene

WINFIELD is seen asleep in a quilt on the ground when Ruthie
enters and rousts him out

RUTHIE
(in an excited whisper)
Git up I got sumpn to show you

WINFIELD
(sleepily)
Whatsa matter

RUTHIE
(tugging him)
Its them white things made outa
dish-stuff like in the catalogues

He stumbles after her
THE EXTERIOR OF SANITARY UNIT NO 4 Ruthie is putting on a

bold front as she leads Winfield into sight but she is still
alert for interference

RUTHIE
Come on Aint nobody gonna say
anything

WINFIELD

Wont they ketch us

He follows her into the unit big-eyed with excitement and
apprehension There is a silence Then

RUTHIES VOICE
Thems where you wash your hans

ANOTHER SILENCE THEN

WINFIELDS VOICE
Whats these

RUTHIES VOICE
(uncertainly)
Well I reckon you stan in them
little rooms--an water come down

( )

ANOTHER SILENCE THEN

WINFIELDS VOICE
(excitedly)
Jes like in the catalogues aint

RUTHIES VOICE
(proudly)
I seen em bfore you did

WINFIELDS VOICE
Whats this

RUTHIES VOICE
(in alarm)
Now dont you go monking--

There is the sound of a toilet flushing It is a cheap toilet
and it is a loud flush which eventually ends in a long
refilling of the tank just as loudly There is a paralyzed
silence Then

RUTHIES VOICE
Now you done it You busted it

WINFIELDS VOICE
I never--

Terrified Winfield comes dashing out of the unit but Ruthie
grabs him just outside the door Beginning to cry he
struggles to get away

WINFIELD
Lemme go I didnt go to do it

RUTHIE
(fiercely)
Keep quite will ya Shet your mouth

WINFIELD
(weeping)
I never knowed it All I done was

refilling of the
tank)

WINFIELD

He nods quickly Then Ruthie begins to
she fancies is an innocent nonchalant
casually Sniffling a little Winfield
innocent walk and yawn indeed

The scene dissolves to a DITCH Alongside the ditch are some
lengths of concrete pipe Tom and the two Wallaces are in

the ditch Tom and Tim picking Wilkie

TOM
(exulting)
If this dont feel good

WILKIE
(chuckling)

Waitll about ‘leven oclock

THOMAS
(angrily)

Well the association dont like the
government camps Cant get a deputy

a warrant But if there was a big
fight and maybe shooting--a bunch
of deputies could go in and clean
out the camp

(Unfolding a newspaper)
Like last night Lissen Citizens
angered at red agitators burn another
squatters’ camp warn agitators to
get out of the county

TOM
(sick of the expression)
Listen What is these reds

TOM

THOMAS

talked myself into trouble but youre
folks like us and I like you

TIM
(extending his hand)
Nobody wont know who tol We thank

(Grimly )
An they aint gonna be no fight

They shake hands

The scene dissolves to the GATE TO THE CAMP at night It is
Saturday evening the night of the dance Glaring electric
lights hang over the open gate Parked jalopies line the
highway as the invited guests small farmers and migrants
from other camps and their families arrive to be greeted
and checked by a committee of three men

COMMITTEE MAN
Evnin maam Whod you say invited
you

GUESTS
Mister an Mizz Clark they ast us

COMMITTEE MAN
Yes maam Come right in maam

There is an air of eager anticipation of gay celebration

and everyone is in his or her best--the men in clean washed
overalls clean shirts some with ties their hair damp and
slicked down the women in their nicest Through the gate
inside the camp can be seen the outdoor dance floor brightly
lighted with the camp musicians already tuning up and around
the dance floor scores of wide-eyed children

INSIDE THE GATE TO THE CAMP we see Wilkie and a dark-
complexioned man named Jule standing among a group inside
watching the arrivals They watch sharply eyeing everyone
listening to every credential As his employer Thomas
comes through the gate with his wife Wilkie grins and
greets him with a handshake

WILKIE
Hidy Mr Thomas Hidy Mizz Thomas

THOMAS
(sotto voce)
You watching out aint you

WILKIE
(grinning)
Dont you worry Aint gonna be no
trouble
THOMAS
I hope you know what youre talking
about

(He moves away Wilkie
grinning after him)

We see the DANCE FLOOR and after three pats of the foot to
get the tempo the home talent dance orchestra swings into
music

INSIDE THE JOAD TENT Rosasharn dressed in her nicest sits
gripping her hands together the music seeming to bring her
to the verge of tears

ROSASHARN

Ma

(Ma turns from drying

dishes )
Ma I--I cant go to the dance I
jus cant Ma I cant hardly stan
it with Connie not here--an me
this way

MA
(trying to cheer her)
Why honey it makes folks happy to
see a girl that way--makes folks

ROSASHARN
(miserably)
I cant hep it Ma It dont make
me giggly an happy

Drying her hands Ma sits beside Rosasharn and takes her in
her arms

MA

(tenderly )
You an mes goin together--jus

But you an me were gonna hear the
music an see the fun

ROSASHARN
An you wont let nobody touch me

MA
No--an look what I got for you

Smiling mysteriously Ma fishes in a pocket in her dress and
brings out the envelope of her treasures From it she produces
the earrings and holds them up in front of Rosasharns wide
eyes

( )

MA

(softly)
I used to wear these--when your pa
come callin on me

(Then as she puts

them on Rosasharns

ears)
Youll look pretty in em tonight

They smile at each other proud in the luxury of ornaments

Down the road from the GATE a touring car with six men pulls
of the pavement and stops Three men get out They are
bareheaded and dressed similar to the other migrants They
stroll down the highway toward the gate The other men
deputies sit watching them

WITHIN THE GATE

WILKIE
They tell me youre half Injun You
look all Injun to me

JULE
No jes half Wisht I was full-
blooded Govmentd be lookin out

The three men stroll past Wilkie and Jule whose eyes follow
them

JULE

WILKIE

( )

JULE

Wilkie moves after them

We see the DANCE FLOOR The musicians are at it and the
fiddler is calling turns

FIDDLER
Swing your ladies an a dol ce do
Join hans roun an away we go

Swing to the right an a swing to the lef Break now break--
back to back

Well in front among the older folks and children who surround
the floor are Ma and Rosasharn clinging close A young man
stops in front of them

MA
(quietly)
Thank you kinly but she aint well

As Rosasharns eyes drop Ma bends toward her a shy smile
on her face

MA
Maybe you wouldnt think it but
your pa was as nice a dancer as I
ever seen when he was young
(With a little sigh)
Kinda makes me think a ol times

The three men stroll into sight and stand watching the
dancing One glances at Ma and Rosasharn but does not speak

Ma has smiled back at him

WILKIE AND JACKSON are seen removed somewhat from the dance
floor they are peering in the direction of the three men

JACKSON
I seen em before Worked at

Gregorios with em But I never ast
em

( )

WILKIE
Awright Keep your eye on ‘em Jus
keep em in sight thats all
(He moves quickly
away )

We find ourselves INSIDE TIM WALLACES TENT The five
members of the central committee Tim Wallace chairman
look grave as a 15-year-old boy reports

BOY
I seen em Mr Wallace A car with
six men parked down by the euclyptus
tree an one with three men on the
main road They got guns too I

TIM

(He stops as Wilkie

enters followed by

Tom)

WILKIE
Theyre here We got em spotted

There is a grim pause at this news Tims eyes go hard
TIM

(to Tom)
You sure you got everthing ready

( )

TOM
(calmly)
Aint gonna be no trouble

TIM
(worriedly)
You aint to hurt them fellas

WILKIE
(grinning)

TOM

TIM

Wilkie makes a mocking military salute as he and Tom exit
The committee men look worriedly after them

FIRST MAN
Mighty sure a themselves looks like

TIM
All I hope I hope they dont kill
nobody

In front of the JOAD TENT dressed to kill is Al ready for
the festivities He wears a tight-fitting wool suit a tie
on his shirt yellow shoes and his hair is damp and slicked
down He rubs his hands together in anticipation as he
strolls in the direction of the dance floor

At ANOTHER TENT a blonde girl sits on a box as Al enters

Casually he throws open his coat revealing a vivid striped
shirt This is designed to stun his quarry

( )

AL
Gonna dance tonight
(The girl
ostentatiously ignores
him)
I can waltz

GIRL
(aloofly)
Thats nothin--anybody can waltz

AL
(shaking his head)
Not like me

A fat woman thrusts her head out of the tent

WOMAN
You git right along This here girls
spoke for Shes gonna be married
an her mans a-comin for her

Shrugging Al winks at the girl and moves on stepping and
moving his shoulders and snapping his fingers in time to the
music a very gay fellow indeed The blonde girls eyes follow
him Then she turns and glances cautiously toward the tent

ON THE DANCE FLOOR we see Ma and Rosasharn as Tom enters
and stands between them This is during a pause between
dances and only a few couples stand on the floor waiting for
the music to begin again We also see the three men very
casually looking around--but no more casual looking than
Wilkie standing just behind them idly whistling

TOM
(grinning)
Shes gettin prettier Ma

MA
(as Rosasharn hides
her face)

Girl with a baby always gets prettier

The music starts again once more the dancers move onto the
dance floor The three men exchange a glance and step casually
to the edge of the dancing space one in the lead They survey
the scene but for the moment make no further move The
atmosphere is tense

TOM
(softly)
Excuse me Ma
(MORE )

( )

TOM (CONTD)
(He moves quietly out
of the scene toward
the three men)
AL taking the blonde girls hand
steps onto the dance floor

Encircling her waist they begin to dance They are a smooth
rhythmic couple who move as one being

AL
Well you said anybody can waltz
Howm I doin

BLONDE GIRL
Dont hold me so tight

AL
(tongue-in-cheek)
Why I aint hardly touchin you

BLONDE GIRL
(squirming)
Youre ticklin me

AL
(grabbing her still
closer)
That comes from not holdin you tight
enough

BLONDE GIRL
(complaining but loving
it)

Now I cant breathe

At this moment the leader of the three men (the other two
directly behind him) enters the scene

LEADER
Ill dance with this girl

AL
(angrily)
You an who else

Behind the three men a solid wall of migrants are closing in
quietly Tom and Wilkie in the middle

LEADER

Dont gimme no argament--
(MORE )

( )

LEADER (CONTD)
(A shrill whistle
sounds in the distance)
--you little--

His fist goes back his left hand reaches for Als collar

At the same instant Tom grabs him Wilkie claps his hand
over the leaders mouth at least fifteen other men have
similarly collard the other two invaders and they are all
lifted bodily There is not a sound as the three men held
in iron grips are whisked from the dance floor and into the

crowd

Two touring cars have stopped in front of the closed GATE

and the deputies have drawn guns

DRIVER

Open up We hear you got a riot

CARETAKER

Riot I dont see no riot Whore

you

DRIVER
Deputy sheriffs

CARETAKER
Got a warrant

DRIVER

We dont need a warrant if its a

riot

CARETAKER

Well I dont know what you gonna do
about it because I dont hear no

riot an I dont see no riot

an

whats more I dont believe they is

no riot
(Waving toward the
dance floor)

Look for yourself

As the deputies puzzled and uncertain

look toward the DANCE

FLOOR we see the music the dancing the gaiety continuing

as if nothing had happened
WITHIN THE JOAD TENT at night several hours later the tent
is black Tom strikes a match From a piece of wood on the
ground or floor he selects one from several cigarette butts
and lights it While he is doing so he lifts his head
suddenly and listens

In the CAMP STREET we catch sight of legs walking the ground
lighted from a flashlight Two pairs of the legs wear state
policemens leather leggings The third pair are the
caretakers They stop behind a car The flashlight plays on
the license plate One of the state cops leans down to copy
the license number in a booklet Then they move on

TOM has lifted the edge of the tent a trifle enough to see
out by flattening his head on the floor The LEGS are now
seen at the Joad jalopy The light is on the license plate

The cop leans over and copies the number They move on

TOM lowering the edge of the tent sits up Quietly he pushes
aside the piece of carpet that covers him He is wearing his
clothes We see the policemans CAR at the caretakers hut

The two policemen get into the car

CARETAKER
You got no right to arrest anybody
without a warrant you know

FIRST COP
Well have a warrant--just as soon
as we check with headquarters

The car drives off leaving the caretaker looking somberly
after it

WITHIN THE JOAD TENT his cap on fully dressed for travel
Tom is tieing the ends of the carpet into a shoulder bundle

Rising he slings it across his shoulder As he tiptoes toward
the door

MA
Aint you gonna tell me goodbye
Tommy

For a moment he looks into the darkness in her direction
TOM

I didnt know Ma I didnt know if
I ought

( )

She has risen pulling the quilt around her He takes her by
the hand

TOM
Come outside

They go out Tom leads Ma around BEHIND THE TENT to a SECTION
OF WIRE FENCE There is a bench there Tom leads Ma to it
and sits her down He sits beside her

TOM
They was some cops here Ma They
was takin down the license numbers
It looks like somebody knows sumpn

MA
(softly)
It had to come I reckon soon or

fence)

MA

MA

( )

He walks away She stands looking after him Hes leaving
her forever--she knows it She lifts her hand and waves She
tries to smile TOM turns waves smiles His lips form the
words Good-by Ma Then he strides away into the darkness

The scene fades out

The JOAD TRUCK fades in It stands loaded in front on the
Joad tent while Al Pa Uncle John Ma and the little
fellas pile in the last article in a fury of excitement
Beyond in the background another jalopy is being prepared
for travel with the same feverish haste It is day

AL PA JOHN

(from the other truck
gaily)

Other jalopies in the background are being readied for leaving--
an excited hopeful exodus on a new report of work

AL

MA

PA
(beaming)

Ma comes out of the tent supporting Rosasharn tenderly For
the plumpness has gone from the girl and she is thin again
her face drawn and unhappy her eyes swollen with weeping
and suffering

MA
(softly)
Try to be strong honey Someday
itll be diffrent--someday youll

( )

MA (CONTD)

PA

MA

AL
(in the drivers seat)

PA
(as he and Ma climb
in the front seat)
Let ‘er go Gallagher

The truck wabbles into motion Al races the engine It
nearly crashes another wheezing jalopy at the corner When
it turns the corner we see the GATE and a line of loaded
jalopies that ride out to the highway The caretaker waves
and the migrants wave back

CARETAKER
Good luck to you Good luck

THE JOADS

never gonna see it no more

her hand on one of Pas and pats it

MA
Woman can change bettern a man Man
lives in jerks--baby born or somebody
dies thats a jerk--gets a farm or
loses one an thats a jerk With a
woman its all one flow like a
stream little eddies little
waterfalls but the river it goes
right on Woman looks at it like
that

AL
(at the jalopy ahead)
Look at that ol coffeepot steam

PA
(thinking of what Ma
says)
Maybe but we shore takin a beatin’

( )

MA

(chuckling)
I know Maybe that makes us tough
Rich fellas come up an they die
an their kids aint no good an
they die out But we keep a-comin
Were the people that live Cant
nobody wipe us out Cant nobody
lick us Well go on forever Pa
Were the people

(She says this with a simple unaffected conviction)

The TRUCK steaming and rattling and churning passes the
Chevrolet and Al leans out of the window and waves a jeering
hand at it As the Joad truck pulls in front we see Ruthie
and Winfield laughing with excitement over the triumph Even
Uncle John shares the general satisfaction Grinning he
waves As the truck moves away along the road all three and
beaming and waving Further along the truck passes a sign on
the side of the road It says NO HELP WANTED

The scene fades out

THE END
