CLOSE ON the anxious sweating frightened face of DREW
MacLEOD 17 running to save her life Think Dustin
Hoffman in Marathon Man -- someone something -- is after
her but UNSEEN

She glances fearfully behind at her mysterious pursuer
her BREATHING becoming more labored

Cutting through a deserted park she leaps a bench

Above her the thin morning sun has only begun to lighten
the leaves

Around the corner shes back on a sidewalk lined with
beautiful homes all quiet at dawn the only noise her
racing FOOTSTEPS and quickening BREATHS

effort hurdles a hedge jumps the stairs and makes the

INT MacLEOD HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING
Drew stands before the mirror perfecting perfection In
a tasteful suit hair just so she opens the drawer

which is hyper-organized everything in a little
labeled nook She pulls out tweezers and we see beneath
where it says tweezers
She leans into the mirror very close spots a stray
eyebrow hair plucks it Pulling back she raises her
other eyebrow Huh Now theyre not even

( )

She leans in again and plucks one from the other eyebrow
Uh-oh This is like when your mom cuts your hair and
keeps cutting to get it even until youre shaved She
reaches for the other side but suddenly catches
herself and stops Deep breath Lets not get too
psychotic
She dunks the tweezers in the alcohol jar then replaces
them
Checking her teeth she spots a stuck bit Grabbing her
WATER PICK she begins cleaning her teeth

Breakfast

Drew turns on her heel and EXITS When Parker sets her
Blackberry down we get our first glimpse of
HER SIDE OF THE BATHROOM which resembles a post-

apocalyptic toiletry landscape Theres a very clear
line of demarcation on the counter like the demilitarized
zone separating the Koreas

Parker reaches among the rubble for her toothbrush but
notices another message on her Blackberry

Hellooo Warren

Distracted Parker drops her toothbrush which bounces
off the counter and PLOPS into the toilet
ON THE TOILET BOWL -- there it is slowly sinking
Parker is stone-faced She looks to her sisters side of
the counter where a fresh brush sits in the flowered
holder Shes considering shes reaching then

brushes with a finger and spits

NT MacLEOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
Drews seated napkin on lap eating granola and studying

Not wanting to draw his attention the Girls shuffle off

Parker leads her into traffic HORNS BLARING as they
weave their way across On the far side a HORSE
CARRIAGE pulls away from the curb and at the last minute
Parker spots a fresh pile of
HORSE SHIT which she manages to leap Drew
however ISNT GOING TO MAKE IT OVER She closes her
eyes
PARKER
Jump
Drew stumbles wrong-foots the takeoff but somehow
manages to get across it to the curb For just a BEAT
we see her surprised face Hm I did it
Then they see Bennie crossing in traffic huffing and
puffing after them and not seeing the pile which he hits
in full stride slips on and PLOPS INTO on his ass
This gives the girls the opening they need and they ditch
inside some revolving doors

dashes down the hallway

puckering his bum
She watches him waddle up the stairs BUT AS HE EXITS HE
PASSES WILLIAMSON AND THE UN SECURITY GUY IN THE
DOORWAY
Drew sees them Uh oh The only thing she can do to
make herself inconspicuous is to drop into the Canadian
Reps chair and turn her back on them like shes one of
the Assembly members She sits up shuffles the files
around

Glancing furtively to either side she sees that everyone
else is wearing the TRANSLATION EARPHONE She puts one
on

ANGLE ON THE DETECTIVE

This is when the CHINESE REP stands furious and points
an accusatory finger at Drew

How do you defend such a position
The world is waiting to hear
These are fighting words The Assembly grows SILENT
Drew wishes she could BEAM HERSELF somewhere off planet

I promise you though my missing
the deadline seems to suggest
otherwise my studies would never
suffer on account of my being
unorganized This was and I
think anyone who knows me would
vouch for this a complete
anomaly
(MORE )

PARKER (CONTD)
I was so thrown when my sister
asked Bernard to the dance that I
simply failed to post the schedule
request and seeing it already
checked off on my to-do list I
over-looked it until after the
deadline had passed

PROFESSOR SPAULDING
Ms MacLeod I recall your
application being one of the
strongest we received Not seeing
your name on the interview list
surprised me I assumed of
course that youd changed your
mind
PARKER
No Not at all This program is
my number one priority
PROFESSOR SPAULDING
Yes well Im sure you can
appreciate that with so many
applicants for so few spaces there
must be rules to govern the
selection process
A FUSS from the OUTER OFFICE interrupts them and suddenly
the door bursts open and Drew BURSTS IN
DREW
Professor Spaulding I cant
apologize enough for barging in
like this
The Professor is not only thrown by the interruption but
by Drews particularly bizarre barefoot look
PROFESSOR SPAULDING
No Please It looks like Im
taking the red-eye now anyway
Drew shuts the door and then is startled when she gets a
face full of Parker already there
DREW
Parker
PARKER
(worried wink)
Hi Parker

( )

DREW
What are you doing
PARKER

(dont blow it)

Oh the Professor and I have had a
wonderful talk about how important
this program is to me and how it
was my sister Drew who screwed
things up

PROFESSOR SPAULDING
Im having a little trouble
following this

DREW
You were being me

PROFESSOR SPAULDING
(to Drew)
Would you like to sit down

Seeing her plan to help Drew go awry poor Parkers lip

trembles

PARKER
When I saw them take you to
jail

PROFESSOR SPAULDING

PARKER
I didnt think youd make it
I knew I wouldnt be any good at
it but I figured at least there
was a chance

DREW
(beat)
Thats sweet
PARKER
Youre not mad
DREW
No
PARKER
Im so sorry for today

DREW
Its okay But lets talk about
it later
PROFESSOR SPAULDING
Please Go right ahead
PARKER
Thank you
DREW

Parker consider just for a
moment whether this is the
appropriate time and place

PARKER
Okay I considered What I want
to say is I didnt purposefully
set out to ruin your day but that
doesnt mean Im not a little
jealous

DREW

Jealous

PARKER

Im not like you I dont have

your intensity your focus your
PROFESSOR SPAULDING

Fashion sense
PARKER
I just mean maybe even if I
dont intend to maybe that
jealousy you know gets in the
way sometimes
DREW
You mean subliminally youre
undermining me
PARKER
I dont know if Id get that
technical about it But yeah
DREW
Well thank you for saying that
PARKER
Youre welcome
(beat)
Arent you going to confess now
( )

DREW
Confess what
PROFESSOR SPAULDING
Theres got to be something Like
how you lost your shoes

PARKER

How youre secretly jealous of me
DREW

Why would I be jealous of you
PARKER

Oh let me see Because I dont
have a stick up my butt Because
I know how to have fun Because
Im spontaneous and creative and
men are all my love slaves

Drew stops ponders this deeply

DREW
Nope
Then she smiles only a teensy bit
DREW

Well maybe about the love slaves
This is the first moment in a long time when the sisters
share a smile Drew turns to the Professor
DREW
Professor Im Drew MacLeod
PROFESSOR SPAULDING
Are you certain
DREW
I wanted more than anything in the
world to be a part of your
program I still do But I
failed I didnt follow the
rules And honestly before
today I didnt know how I was
going to live with that How to
live with failure Im not good
at it I havent done it much
But today I realized that Ive
lived in fear of it too long

(MORE)

DREW (CONTD)
I hope my application was a strong
one and I came here today to ask
your indulgence and to place my
name back into consideration If
you wont Ill understand
Better yet Ill get over it
Maybe I shouldnt be in such a
hurry after all Maybe it would
be best for me to just take
this
Drew takes her DAYBOOK from Parker and drops it in the
wastebasket
DREW
and lighten up
Parker looks horrified at the sight of Drews daybook in
the trash and fishes it out
DREW
Thanks for your time Sorry if
