EXT WILDERNESS - NIGHT

RUMBLES in the

IN

Mist Dark trees Dripping vines An ENGINE
distance
The full moon shimmers on a puddle A FROG SPLATS

splashing a one man pup tent
INSIDE THE TENT

LUKEs eyes pop open disoriented realizing hes fallen
asleep reading by flashlight Hes nineteen still slightly
awkward and unaware hes growing handsome

He listens as the ENGINE RUMBLES LOUDER closer

He peers out through the tent flap Glaring head lamps ROAR
toward him Scrambling out of his sleeping bag he HURLS
himself against the side of the tent as

OUTSIDE

an RV CAMPER nearly plows down the tent skidding to a stop
in the mud

Stillness
Luke extricates himself from the tent He runs to

the driver-

eyed

side window of the RV

She nods yes

EXT LANGFORD UNIVERSITY - MORNING

Students crisscross on bikes in front of the quadrangle
The huge round headlights and muscular front grill of an old
SEMI-TRUCK RUMBLES up to the curb Its the cab only like
the sliced-off front of a train engine

Luke hops down startling his friends KEENAN and JANINE
passionately making out on the sidewalk

Twenty brainy and athletic Janine adjusts her glasses the
only remnant of a bookish past as she thoughtfully

Lukes massive truck

JANINE
Its remarkable Sort of retro I
thought you were gettin a pickup

LUKE
I changed my mind

Hoping for a more enthusiastic response he turns to Keenan
who climbs up and peeks inside the cab Hes rugged
streetwise perpetually bemused -maybe Ed Norton and Bill
Murray had a son

KEENAN
Its awesome Its pleather

LUKE
Fuck you You think its stupid

Janine stares at him

LUKE (CONTD)
What

She shrugs trying to put her finger on it and when Luke
rolls up his T-shirt sleeves she grins

LUKE (CONTD)
What

JANINE
Oh my God You got laid
Finally Who is she

Luke glares at Keenan

KEENAN
I didnt say a word I swear You
know Janine Shes got X-ray

Camping A total stranger

JANINE
I knew that whole waitin to meet

JANINE
Could find something to call me
other than what every guy in the
world would say

KEENAN
Sweetheart Babe
Aphrodite
Janine sneers At a loss Keenan grabs her and kisses her

passionately
She walks off rolling her eyes but secretly loves it
Keenan climbs up into the cab

KEENAN (CONTD)
So this is gonna be like your car

LUKE
Look I know its dopey But dont
you recognize it Its painted and
the mufflers switched out -but

Keenan looks around with fresh eyes He reaches an arm way
up under the glove box and GRINS pulling out a small stash
of weed

KEENAN
Ten years A little dried out

EXT COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY

The truck barrels along through the trees Luke and
Keenan

INT ROAD RAGE GARAGE - DAY

A small run-down service garage crammed with tires tools
and discarded car parts

Lukes truck idles in the service bay billowing smoke

MAX nineteen lean in overalls with shoulder-length hair
and edgy eyes wipes his greasy hands on a rag

Dripping with masculinity he swaggers around the truck
chewing gum wielding a pneumatic torque-wrench which he
occasionally REVS for emphasis

MAX
I can do the gasket for twenty
bucks But new T-sprocks for this
thing Two three hundred maybe

LUKE
Shit Can I hold off on that

MAX
No skin off my ass But a few
days weeks your whole
transmission could blow

LUKE
Ah Jeez I shouldnt got this
Max considers sets his baseball cap on the truck fender and
SIGHS

MAX
Four hundred seventy-five
horsepower Twenty-eight inch
wheels Its a classic Let me
dig around out back Maybe we got
a used set

LUKE
Thatd be great Thanks

Max disappears through a squeaky door at the back
Luke picks up a rag and wipes fingerprints off the fender
He sits impatient for Max to return

He examines Maxs cap tries it on He picks up the torque-
wrench swaggers about trying to look macho in the manner
of Max

He spins around and REVS the wrench catching sight of
MICHELLE twenty watching him from out front in jeans and

shirt with warm confident eyes

Luke swallows wide-eyed a deer in headlights He sets
down the torque-wrench

LUKE (CONTD)
Its not my wrench Its my truck

MICHELLE

HIGH FEVER and PASSES OUT slumping to the ground

BEHIND THE DUMPSTER - LATE NIGHT

Lukes eyes open dilated disoriented Hes lying on the
ground shirtless among bits of garbage

He watches bleary-eyed as a MOUSE peers at him from inside
an empty milk carton The mouse runs over and sniffs at a

canteloupe which triggers Lukes memory

He GRABS his chest relieved to find its back to normal

He stands dizzy surveying the dark locked restaurant and

staggers across the deserted parking lot toward his truck

He looks around for the source of the sounds glances over
RIGHT SIDE VIEW MIRROR
in its reflection a leering male stripped to the waist

MALE VOICE (0S)

The HEAD LAMPS of an oncoming car FLASH at him

As he glances out the driver-side window MUSIC BLARES from
the passing car

INSIDE THE CAR
A glimpse of what might be an ORGY of BODIES intertwined

The FEMALE DRIVER - GRINS MANIACALLY UP at Luke as the CAR
HORN SCREAMS by

Michelle leans against the shower wall staring at the spray
of water upset

Steam rises filling the bathroom
She begins SINGING longingly
MICHELLE
IT wanna know how to go
To the inside of love

Washing herself
behind the shower curtain
the timbre of her singing voice mysteriously shifts
As her hand turns the shower faucet it changes
MICHELLE (CONTD)
Im outside of love
To the side or above

I cant find my way with you

A glimpse of her shoulder behind the shower curtain grows
more muscular

and her voice begins LOWERING IN PITCH
as MICHELLE BECOMES MAX

MAX
Must be a special view
Finding a me with a you
On the inside of love

Max steps out of the shower and towels off in the mirror

INT ORLANDOS BED and BREAKFAST - NIGHT

A persistent KNOCK on the door Sydney pulls on a robe over
a pair of mens boxers wiping sleep from her eyes She
swings the door open

Luke stands outside in POURING RAIN

SYDNEY
Oh honey Come in

BY THE FIREPLACE
Sydney pours hot tea

LUKE
Youre one too Why didnt you
tell me

SYDNEY
I didnt want to confuse the issue

LUKE
So its true what you said You
really know I wouldnt change
unless I wanted to

SYDNEY
Maybe some part of you

LUKE
What part How much of me I
mean for it to work Half More
than half What if it was only a
tiny bit -a thought

SYDNEY
I dont know But I believe there
may be thousands of Zs out there
millions for all we know go their
whole lives without even knowing
they are one Nothing ever
Luke nods

happens You couldnt keep it from
happening

LUKE
I love being with Michelle How
come I cant control it when shes
around

SYDNEY
I think whatever part of yourself
you deny just gets bigger and
bigger until it takes you over

sadly

LUKE
You think I dont really want to be
a man

SYDNEY
I think for some making it stop is
more important than knowing who you
are It was for me

LUKE
Maybe for me too

SYDNEY
Right now youre Morphescent The
key is to have sex with another Z
You become Adulmorphic Your
gender locks You cant just
change anytime you want

LUKE
Another 2

SYDNEY
Thats why I came all the way out
here

LUKE
And why you keep tryin to get me
in the sack

SYDNEY
Thought maybe I could save you some
distress But you say youre not

attracted to me For it to work
both of us have to be into it

LUKE
That wont be a problem

SYDNEY
Okay then
LUKE
Tonight
SYDNEY

Not right now Okay Tonight

EXT CEMETERY - MORNING

Morning dew Acres of empty grass Luke sits at the top of
a hill by his dads grave

LUKE
Remember that Christmas when Keen
and me accidentally set the
Scofields house on fire

He stares up at the sky

LUKE (CONTD)
And that burning shingle drifted
over and lit up the Robertsons
place The whole town was ready to
lynch us and we snuck back home
Two AM you were up drinkin
coffee

He tugs out hunks of grass

LUKE (CONTD)
I thought you were gonna kill us
But you just looked me right in the
eye and said Son theres
leftover pizza in the fridge

A tear rims his eye

LUKE (CONTD)
That was the coolest thing anyone
ever said Dad Im in such
trouble

LUKE (CONTD)
I feel like if I let this thing in
its all over But I dont know
what else to do Guess you cant
figure out who you are until you
accept who you might be

INT ORLANDOS BED and BREAKFAST - DAY

Department store shopping bags and boxes are strewn across
the bed

Sydney checks herself out in the full-length mirror A
mans
gray tuxedo jacket over lingerie

INT LUMBER MILL - DAY

The giant work floor of the abandoned mill Sunlight beams
through holes in the roof

Max on roller blades practices guiding the hockey puck
along the floor

He stops when he notices the figure watching him from
outside
the giant metal doors

Luca in the blue dress on roller blades hockey stick in
hand

MAX
Youre about the last person I
expected to see

LUCA
I can show you a few moves if you
want

MAX
Yeah What the hell

LATER

Luca demonstrates hockey technique expertly guiding a
hockey

puck through an obstacle course of broken equipment timber

and sawdust piles

All the while she dodges Maxs attempts to steal the puck

Max finally gets it which riles Luca She hip checks Max
They swerve to avoid a pipe crash-landing on top of each

other on a sawdust pile

They bust out LAUGHING

LUCA
Not bad

MAX
Youre better than Luke

LUCA

I taught him everything he knows

Luca pulls away from Max suddenly self-conscious that Maxs

leg is on top of hers

Awkward from the broken connection
sky through a hole in the roof

MAX
I thought you left town

LUCA
Had to come back

MAX
Good

LUCA

they gaze up at the blue

Whered you learn to speak Italian

MAX

Just tourist stuff Ill have the
spaghetti bolognese How much

for a room

LUCA
Have you been

MAX
Little Italy In New York

Someday though Want to go with
me

Max leans over and KISSES Luca She responds tentatively
at
first

then as she grows more confident
her face REDDENS she GASPS

Luca pulls back self-conscious confused She brushes
sawdust off her dress stands

LUCA
Look this was a mistake

MAX
Yeah Of course I know

Looking up Luca sees Keenan staring at them from across
the

floor incredulous
Keenan exits out through the giant doors

LUCA
Oh Jesus

MAX
Are you and he

LUCA
Huh

MAX
Its really none of my business

LUCA
No Im sorry I shouldntve
come here

Max stands brushes off the sawdust

MAX
Please dont say youre just
visiting That you need to
leave Im the one who needs to
leave
Max skates off across the giant shop floor

EXT LUMBER MILL - DUSK

The Semi Truck is parked alone in the middle of the asphalt
From inside the cab the blue dress flips over the rolled
down window

ACROSS THE PARKING LOT

Keenan leans against a tractor rolls his eyes and twists
open another beer which he gulps

AT THE TRUCK

Luke hops down from the truck cab wearing Langford U sweats
and a T-shirt

Keenan sits on the running board

KEENAN
I mean what the FUCK is goin on

Keenan downs his beer pensive He crushes the can and
hurls

KEENAN

LUKE
I had to be sure I am now Come

Suddenly uncomfortable sitting so close to Luke Keenan
stands

LUKE (CONTD)

Keenan rides off leaving Luke shell-shocked

INT SYDNEYS BED and BREAKFAST - NIGHT
Sydney wears a stunning black silk evening gown
Small Greek statues now adorn the room

LUKE
I guess I really did need to face
it head on in order to see

SYDNEY
It was courageous

LUKE
Girls are just I dont know
Its a different energy Theyre
soft and warm they can make a guy
feel complete

SYDNEY
And multiple os Actually male
Zs have multiple os too Been so
long I nearly forgot

LUKE
Cool

SYDNEY
Okay to be honest Im relieved

being certain

Sydney pops a cork and pours herself and Luke glasses of
champagne A toast

SYDNEY (CONTD)
To womanhood

LUKE
To manhood

They drink
LUKE (CONTD)
So how does this work
SYDNEY
We just do it And it just
happens
AT THE BED

Luke and Sydney begin undressing

SYDNEY
Do you like this dress

LUKE
Sure Looks great on you Man
dresses Even without everything
else dresses are reason enough
right there to stay a guy

Sydney takes this in considers

SYDNEY
Stay a guy Let me get this
straight You didnt decide to be
a woman

LUKE
No Of course not What

Sydney realizing her mistake regroups Plan B

SYDNEY
Just testing you Hold on a
moment Theres something I
forgot

She retrieves some ROPE

LUKE
Whats that for

SYDNEY
Youve never done it with another
Z Trust me you need to be tied
down

LUKE
Does it hurt

SYDNEY
On the contrary

BEDSIDE TABLE - LATER

The alabaster eyes of a small Greek Statue stares blankly in
the direction of the CARNAL SOUNDS coming from the bed OFF
SCREEN

SYDNEY (0S)
Just let yourself go completely

LUKE (0S)
Wow this is intense

SYDNEY (0S)
When two Zs do it the lateral
hypothalamus gets completely
overwhelmed

LUKE (0S)
OH MAN

SYDNEY (0S)
Cellular fission kicks in and

well you can go Zytusional
LUKE (0S)
Unbelievable

The chiseled eyes of a two-foot Statue of David blankly
stare

LUKE (0S) (CONTD)
Oh no Whats happening

Lukes voice begins RISING IN PITCH
HALF-LUCA (0S)
What have you done
(Luca)
NOOOOO
The SOUNDS ESCALATE growing increasingly more INTENSE
culminating in the extraordinary never before heard

SOUND OF ZYTUSIONAL CLIMAX

LUCALUKE AND SYDNEY (0S)
CEUUUEeeeeeeeenees

Silence

MIRROR - LATER
A great-looking bare-chested guy with Sydneys hair appears
in reflection MALE SYDNEY

Behind him still strapped to the bed is now Luca a GAG in
her mouth

Male Sydney carries a phone while fussing with his hair in
the mirror

MALE SYDNEY

Male Sydney clicks the phone off

MALE SYDNEY (CONTD)
You can have all my clothes Oh

Anna Felucci pumps
(reconsiders)

Male Sydney returns to dressing a ribbed tank beneath a
gray
Italian tux

MALE SYDNEY (CONTD)
Okay I wasnt completely honest
with you but I never lied either
It stopped That is what you
wanted Youre Adulmorphic now
The only way to switch is to do it
with another Z

He gazes at Luca a pang of guilt He sits on the bed
speaks softly

MALE SYDNEY (CONTD)
I know you dont believe me but
this is the right thing for you
Eventually youll figure that on
your own But I could tell it was
just gonna take way too long

Luca stares distraught

MALE SYDNEY (CONTD)
Oh for Chris sake Being a woman
doesnt make you any less of a man

The entire bed LURCHES back and forth as Luca struggles

Male Sydney winces pangs of guilt which turn to anger

LATER

His eyes GO WIDE

He pushes the window open a little whispers

KEENAN (CONTD)
Hang on a sec Look Im sorry

Keenan climbs on top of Luca starts untying her hands
straddling her

KEENAN (CONTD)

With Herculean effort Keenan struggles to hold back
tears

KEENAN (CONTD)

She glances back sad and angry
Luca watches her go distraught and then RUNS
ATOP A GRASSY HILLSIDE

Luca collapses on the ground overlooking Polly Wogs

Janine and Keenan run up a few yards behind They sit
nearby catching their breath unsure what to say

Luca gazes up at the moon

POLLY
Girl trouble Boy trouble

shrugs

POLLY (CONTD)

Max nods

She sinks

dawn

sets up a new rack

MAX
Whats the point It never works

of broken hearts But eventually
I found him

the cue ball in a corner pocket

POLLY (CONTD)

Scratch Then he died
MAX

Sorry
POLLY

Everything reminded me of him So
I came here half way round the
world to forget Then created this
place just like the one where we
met

MAX
He cant handle this Us He
cant handle who he is

POLLY
You being a guy too

MAX
Or him being a girl

Pollys confused but presses on

POLLY
Everyones terrified But once you
really know someone and they know
you it makes you whole

MAX

No one wants to know who I really
am

POLLY
Youre so sure

MAX
Its impossible He was the one
person I thought could understand
But no its impossible

Max puts the cue stick down and moves off Polly calls
after

POLLY
Its worth finding out
EXT ROAD RAGE GARAGE - LATE AFTERNOON

Luca moves off as Max removes his boot and his sock
MAX

Luca stares at Max and then down at his ankle at the
TATTOO

OF A GREEN BIRD
Max meets her eyes
and it finally dawns on Luca

standing in shock and now putting it all together
she LUNGES for him nailing him to the ground kissing him

She RIPS Maxs T-shirt as they fall to the asphalt knocking
over oil cans

Passion Unbridled
IN THE PARTS YARD

Luca manhandles Max shoving him against a pile of huge
tires as Maxs face transforms

BY OLD RADIATORS

Michelle slams back onto the crabgrass She pulls Luca
toward her as Lucas face transforms into Luke

BY DISCARDED TRUCK CHASSIS
Luke and Michelle roll on the crabgrass kissing

TRANSFORMING as they roll into Luca and Max and Michelle

and
Luke and Luca -or was that Max

Michelle bites her lip embarrassed releases him
LUKE (CONTD)
