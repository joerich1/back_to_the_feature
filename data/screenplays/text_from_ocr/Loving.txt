EXT SMALL FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 1
Crickets A spring night in rural Virginia

MILDRED seems nervous Her eyes cast down She’s
beautiful A slender light skinned black woman High

cheekbones hint at a mix of Native American ancestry

She picks her head up and takes a deep breath Her big brown
eyes are soft in the light of the front porch

MILDRED
I’m pregnant

RICHARD listens He’s a white man with close cropped
blonde hair and a dark neck burned from working outside

He takes in the information

A smile breaks across his face revealing a mouth full of
crooked teeth He quickly draws his lips over them
swallowing the smile He’s shy self-conscious of the teeth

He begins to nod a more reserved smile coming through

RICHARD
Good That’s real good

At this Mildred’s shoulders drop with relief

They sit close to one another on the front steps of a one-
story wood planked house

It’s 1958 They are young but a rural working life makes
them seem older than their years

Richard takes her hand She leans into him

An ominous SOUND grows in the distance A rumbling like
thunder It builds

EXT DRAG RACING STRIP - DAY 2

The chassis on an early 50’s Chevy rocks back and forth as
gas charges through the idling motor

VIRGIL continues to rev the car as he steals a glance at
his competition another bulked up American machine primed to
explode off the starting line

Virgil is a mustached black man with thick eyebrows He
wears a bowler hat and clinches a toothpick in his teeth He
catches the OTHER DRIVER’s eye a white man Virgil smiles
A Man snaps a rag into the air

Tires smoke Rubber streaks the asphalt as the cars light
out down the strip

Richard pops off the hood of a parked car and tracks the
race He’s part of a GROUP gathered on the dirt swath that
borders the track

Mildred is with her sister GARNET a woman of similar
features and beauty The Group of seven is made up of blacks
and whites Most hold cans of beer All follow the race

The two cars race neck and neck their chrome bumpers
straining for the lead Virgil’s car manages to pull ahead

Standing by Richard are RAYMOND a thick-necked black man
who is easy to smile when not sweating a race and PERCY a tall man who watches more than he talks At Virgil’s car
taking the lead Raymond’s hand comes up

RAYMOND
There goes

The other Driver leans into the wheel as if to aid his
chances but it doesn’t help

Virgil manages a car length lead as he tears across the
finish line He yells and punches at the roof

Richard’s arm flies up but he’s silent Raymond lets out a
whooping sound before swinging out his massive palm which
Richard meets with a slap The Group cheers behind them

Richard walks back to Mildred but on his way

RICHARD
Timing’s still off ‘bout two
degrees

RAYMOND

Looked fine to me
(to Percy)
What you think

PERCY
I think we won

Mildred runs up and gives Richard a big hug
B4

EXT DRAG RACING STRIP - DAY - LATER 3

Virgil and Percy stand in front of the other Driver and his
CREW all white as the Driver counts a stack of cash out and
places it in Virgil’s outstretched bowler hat

VIRGIL
Now that’s just fine right there I
told them ‘bout ya’ll that you boys
have ya’ll’s yes keep on now you
boys have a fast car right there
but ya’ll is fine to let us race
wit you

Virgils words come out in a jumble making their meaning
nearly imperceptible though their intention is clear

The money counted Virgil sets the cash filled hat on his
head and nods at the other Driver He cuts a smile at Percy
before they turn back to join their own group

The disgruntled men rest against their beaten car Their
attention is not on Virgil’s collection but rather on
Richard and Mildred across the track

Richard holds Mildred close kissing her proudly The Crew
just stares across at them visibly seething

EXT SHOTGUN SHACK - NIGHT A4
A hillbilly house party in full swing

A few cars come and go but most are parked in an array
around the yard People spill out of the tiny house

INT SHOTGUN SHACK - NIGHT 4

The shack is brimming with bodies thick smoke and booze
Laughter and shouts fill in amidst fast paced fiddles banjo
and upright bass pounding out a bluegrass stomp

The crowd is mostly black though a few whites are mingled
throughout Many look to be Native American

Richard his arm around Mildred clutches a beer and
struggles to shout his point into Raymond’s ear An
inaudible reply from Raymond brings a red faced gut laugh
from Richard Percy looks over to see what was so funny

Virgil bumps through the crowd half dancing while carefully
balancing his jar of clear liquor He bows the drink to
Mildred but Garnet’s hand swoops in to take it
Garnet wags a finger before taking an eyebrow raising sip at
the stout stuff She eyes Mildred who smiles back at her

Virgil pulls Garnet up to dance not forgetting to reclaim his
drink He proceeds to dance in a way that spreads the crowd
Mildred nudges Richard

They laugh watching their friends dance happy in this place

EXT BUILDING SITE - DAY 5

Mortar is thrown onto a brick and buttered with a jointer
before another brick comes down on top It’s a rhythmic
task done with precision

Richard stands in front of a growing wall amongst several
OTHER MEN laying brick at a bustling job site

BRICKLAYER
Damn Richard Slow down

Richard smiles to himself He finishes out his course of
bricks and quickly gathers his tools Walking away

RICHARD
All right now

BRICKLAYER
Where you goin’

Richard doesn’t answer He moves toward a collection of cars
parked nearby

EXT UNCULTIVATED FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON 6

A light breeze moves through full summer leaves shading a
hillside Grass bends in a low-lying field down below

Richard’s feet move heel to toe counting out a length
Still in his work clothes he pauses and stares out at the
field down below before finally turning to Mildred

Time has passed since seeing her last A growing belly shows
six months of her pregnancy She watches him curiously

RICHARD
Do you like it

MILDRED

RICHARD
Right here This spot
MILDRED
You mean this field
RICHARD
Yeah
MILDRED

This field not a mile from my house
that I’ve been knowin’ all my life

Richard breaks away and faces the lower field again

RICHARD

MILDRED
Richard stop this I don’t know
what youre sayin’

RICHARD

Mildred is speechless Her eyes wander over the ground as if
seeing it for the first time She barely notices Richard
move close taking her hand

Her eyes finally meet his He looks serious
RICHARD (CONTD)
Mildred
EXT GROVE - EVENING 7

Feet rushing through tall grass dodging in and out of limbs
and brambles

Mildred as best she can carrying the extra weight darts
through a grove of trees
EXT TOBACCO FIELD - EVENING 8

The tobacco field is vast bordered on one side by a thicket
of trees and falling off to a horizon on the other

The sun is quickly setting behind the field but a DOZEN
PEOPLE black and white still toil there They slouch over
the plants weeding grass from between thick green leaves

Mildred emerges from the thicket of trees moving fast She
rushes into the field weaving between rows

Garnet barely straightens before Mildred has grabbed her by
the hand and pulls her away from her work

GARNET
What’s this now

Garnet is led out of the field back into the trees

EXT GROVE - EVENING 9

Fireflies have begun to rise in the grove Mildred is tucked
against a tree in the midst of a whisper to her sister

MILDRED
Said he’d bought it for me And
then he asked me to marry him

GARNET
No he didn’t

MILDRED
Yes

Mildred’s hand covers her mouth trying to contain her
excitement

GARNET
Right out in the field Oh Lord
that man might be crazy When you
gonna do it

MILDRED
He didn’t say Soon though
Before the baby comes

Garnets eyes move upward as she takes in a long breath She
seems troubled

GARNET
He’s gonna take my sister from me

MILDRED
No We’ll be right down the road

Garnet takes Mildred’s hand and holds it to her face
Mildred smiles which leads her sister to as well They
giggle at one another as evening takes hold

Chickens peck the morning dew in the yard around a tin roofed

very pregnant WHITE GIRL out of the front door

RICHARD

Richard grabs the young Girl’s hand to help her down the
porch steps On the ground she heads to the pickup

under the hood of their Chevy race car parked inside

Richard snags a roller board and wrench from the corner and
slides on his back under the front end

below They work in silence for awhile Then

RICHARD

Raymond takes this in but doesn’t stop working

RAYMOND
You sure about that

RICHARD

Raymond lifts the part out and carries it to a table

RAYMOND
Hold on stay under there

Raymond returns with another piece that he drops under the
hood Richard with no need for explanation grabs the piece
and starts to affix it to the car

You need a witness

RICHARD
No I was gonna ask her Dad to
come with us

As they continue to work Virgil enters the barn He
immediately finds Raymond’s sandwich He picks it up and
smells it

Rich is gonna take Mildred up to
DC to get married

Virgil takes a bite With a full mouth
VIRGIL

String Bean That don’t make no

handcuffs and unlocks the communal cell

his face He tries to see down the hall to Mildred but
can’t

answer that isn’t coming He brings his hand up to his face
to cover his hurried breathing

Stuck he begins to gather himself He turns to the large
open cell Shadowy FIGURES line the walls and pace around
the windows Mostly drunks one mumbles in the corner

Richard backs into an open spot on the wall by the door He
leans there keeping his eyes on the room

but I met with the Judge this
morning and I was able to work out
a deal that I think is fair

FRANK BEAZELY is a polished small town lawyer

Judge Bazile is a friend but he is
not a fan of your particular
situation If you all plead
guilty the judge is willing to
suspend any prison time

Mildred lets out an audible sigh of relief Richard takes
her hand and nods at Frank

RICHARD
Well do it

FRANK BEAZELY
Now in exchange for suspending the
jail time you and your wife
unless of course you choose to
dissolve the marriage will be
forced to leave the state

RICHARD
Leave the state What’s that mean

FRANK BEAZELY
It’s exactly what it sounds like
You will not be allowed to remain
in the state together Richard
youll be allowed to return for
work and Mildred can visit but
the two of you are never allowed to
be in the state at the same time
and certainly aren’t allowed to be
here together

MILDRED
For how long How long will that
last

Frank chews on his cheek reluctant to give the details

FRANK BEAZELY
Twenty five years

Mildred is stunned Richard’s jaw goes slack with disbelief

RICHARD
That can’t be right

FRANK BEAZELY
Look you got a year in state
penitentiary which I remind you
could have been up to five years at
the maximum you got a year in

state on the other That’s an easy
choice

teeth

Donald exits as he pulls the mended shirt over his head

MILDRED (CONT’D)
Theyd like to help with our case

RICHARD
We can’t afford a lawyer

MILDRED
They said they wouldn’t charge us

This stops Richard He’s paying attention now but looking

skeptical

MILDRED (CONTD)
Were going to see him on Thursday
His name is Cohen

Richard gives a faint nod Mildred smiles and exits to the

children’s room

Richard processes what may have been an ambush

Polished shoes tap along a linoleum hallway

BERNIE COHEN is a dapper man in a suit and hat

He

carries a briefcase and walks with a confident stride

He enters a glass door

INT LAW OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 104
A SECRETARY sits at a desk just inside the law office

SECRETARY
Yes

Bernie walks to a connecting hall but turns back on his way
BERNIE COHEN
My clients are Mr and Mrs Loving
Could you send them down when they

arrive

SECRETARY
Certainly

Bernie finds the third door There is a name plate there
reading “JACK GREEN”

Cohen slips the plate out of its holder and places it in his
jacket pocket From the same pocket he produces a plate of
his own and slides it into the slot on the door

It now reads “BERNARD COHEN” He enters

INT DC LAW OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 105
The office is tidy and nicely furnished

Bernie immediately goes to the desk and begins gathering up a
collection of frames containing pictures of the other

lawyer’s family

He goes behind the desk and places the frames in the top
drawer He lays out a pad and pen from his briefcase

There is a KNOCK at the door

Cohen takes a seat in the desk chair and readies himself

BERNIE COHEN
Come in

The door opens and Mildred enters followed by Richard
Bernie immediately stands and comes around to offer his hand

BERNIE COHEN (CONT’D)
Mrs Loving

MILDRED
Yes

BERNIE COHEN
So nice to meet you Please have
a seat

He turns to Richard and they shake hands

BERNIE COHEN (CONT’D)
Bernard Cohen It’s a pleasure

Richard sits staying quiet Bernie takes note of his
demeanor as he goes back behind the desk

BERNIE COHEN (CONT’D)
Thank you for coming in today So
as we discussed on the phone the
ACLU would like to take on your
case I was actually a charter
member of the ACLU here in Virginia
which is why they assigned me to
you The bottom line is we want
to get you all some relief

MILDRED
That’s very generous Thank you

BERNIE COHEN

I took the liberty of contacting
the courthouse in Bowling Green and
have started a file for you Now
the first step is to appeal the
sentence in Caroline County That
will be our fastest route into
Federal Court The problem is

RICHARD
Federal court

BERNIE COHEN
Yes the goal is to try and get the
Federal Court to hear this case so
we can get

RICHARD
‘Scuse me but I don’t understand
Federal Court

BERNIE COHEN
Well I see it as the best route

RICHARD
Can’t you just go talk to Judge
Bazile I mean we aren’t hurtin’
anybody Can’t you just go tell
him that

BERNIE COHEN
I don’t think

RICHARD
Just talk to him Tell him if he
lets us back in the state we won’t
bother anybody

Bernie takes a moment recalculating his approach

BERNIE COHEN
Look I do not think this is going
to be resolved in Judge Bazile’s
court or probably any other court
in the state of Virginia for that
matter I believe this is a court
battle that could possibly go all
the way to the highest court in the
land

Richard looks at him blankly Bernie gets specific
BERNIE COHEN (CONT’D)
It is very likely that this case
could go all the way to the Supreme
Court

Richard’s eyebrows raise incredulous He slumps back in his
chair It’s a dismissive posture

Bernie looks puzzled by this unsure of his next move

MILDRED
We’re listening

Seeing an ally in Mildred he starts back in with his focus
toward her

BERNIE COHEN
Our problem is that in order to
appeal the judgment of conviction
we would’ve needed to do so within
60 days Now given that it’s been
five years since that conviction
we have to find a way to get this
case back into the courts Are you
following

Mildred nods with a pleasant smile Richard gives a nod

BERNIE COHEN (CONT’D)
I’ve given this some thought and I
have a somewhat unorthodox idea on
how to do this but in order to get
this back into the stream of the
courts given that you are
currently on probation my
suggestion would be for the two of
you to return to Caroline County
get re-arrested and then we will
have an avenue for our appeal

Richard looks at him as if his face is on upside down

RICHARD
You want us to get arrested again

BERNIE COHEN
Yes It’s an idea I of course
would be there to bail you out

Richard looks to Mildred She catches his eyes but then
looks down She tries to keep her smile

RICHARD
We aren’t gonna do that

Bernie chews on this realizing his misstep

BERNIE COHEN
Right That’s notI can see how
that was a bad idea I understand
Look I need to do some more
thinking on this first issue but
again bottom line we’re gonna get
you all some help

Mildred smiles at him and stands She reaches her hand out
across the desk

MILDRED
We appreciate you We really do

Richard stands and shakes Bernie’s hand but is quickly out
the door Mildred follows
The door shuts and Bernie is left alone
He leans back in the chair and let’s out a breath He tosses
his pen down displeased with his performance

A portion of it reads

“We haven’t heard anything from you for so long we had
given up hope”

INT BERNIE COHEN’S LAW OFFICE - DAY 127

He mouths a collection of the words

Bernie puts the letter down frustrated He thinks for a

try to set a meeting

INT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITYANTIEAU’S OFFICE - DAY 128
A SECRETARY knocks at an office door

Come in

The Secretary enters and finds CHET ANTIEAU sitting ina
high backed chair talking with PHIL HIRSCHKOP a baby-
faced man with dark hair wearing a neat blue suit

PHIL HIRSCHKOP
I’d never seen anything like it
No matter how many times I go down
there I find something that
surprises me

ANTIEAU’S SECRETARY
Excuse me

The Secretary sets a note down in front of Chet who gives it
a glance

CHET ANTIEAU
Oh yes please bring him back

The Secretary exits

CHET ANTIEAU (CONT’D)
This is good timing I want you to
meet a former student of mine He
called about a case you may find
interesting

PHIL HIRSCHKOP
Sure what’s it about

At that moment Bernie Cohen is shown into the room He
enters with a smile and a hand extended to Chet

BERNIE COHEN
Hello Professor thanks for seeing
me

Chet stands to shake

CHET ANTIEAU
My pleasure You came at a good
time Bernie This is Phil
Hirschkop he’s a brilliant civil
rights lawyer

Phil scoffs at this

CHET ANTIEAU (CONT’D)
Is it all right if he joins us

BERNIE COHEN
Please It’s nice to meet you

PHIL HIRSCHKOP
(shaking hands)
You too

Bernie takes a seat in the open chair

CHET ANTIEAU
So what’s the problem
BERNIE COHEN
Well I’m a bit stumped The ACLU
referred this case to me concerning
an interracial couple that was
married in DC They were arrested
for living together in Virginia and
the judge suspended their prison
sentence under order that they
leave the state for 25 years I
filed a motion to vacate the
judgement with Judge Bazile the
original trial judge in Caroline
County but he’s stonewalling me
He’s had my motion under advisement
for months and I feel like he
could keep it that way until he
retires Of course the ACLU sees
this and I agree as a potential
contender to repeal anti-
miscegenation laws nationwide I
just need to get the ball rolling
as it were

Chet looks over to Phil whose eyebrows are raised

PHIL HIRSCHKOP
That’s a remarkable case

BERNIE COHEN
I’m stuck

EXT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY - EVENING

Bernie and Phil walk through the campus continuing what has

been a very long conversation

BERNIE COHEN
But that may not solve the issue

PHIL HIRSCHKOP
It’s a very delicate situation
because by appealing you open up
the possibility of sending both of
them to prison I think regardless
you file the 1983 motion explaining
your complaint It’1l force
Bazile’s hand and get you in front
of a federal three-judge panel

Phil checks his watch

PHIL HIRSCHKOP (CONT’D)
Look I’m catching a plane to New
York tonight I’11 work up a draft
on the plane and find you Monday

BERNIE COHEN
That’s great That’s just great
Thank you

PHIL HIRSCHKOP
Bernie if you don’t mind me
asking how much experience do you
have with constitutional law

BERNIE COHEN
Some

Bernie takes a moment then amends

BERNIE COHEN (CONT’D)
Very little

PHIL HIRSCHKOP
You realize this case could alter
the constitution of the United
States

BERNIE COHEN
I do

Phil smiles at him

PHIL HIRSCHKOP
I’11 call you on Monday

Phil walks away Bernie takes a deep breath left alone with
the ivy under the tower of Healy Hall

Bernie sits behind the desk in his office as Phil in a chair
on his left reads from a file

PHIL HIRSCHKOP
(reading)
Almighty God created the races
white black yellow malay and
red and he placed them on separate
continents

Mildred and Richard listen from wing chairs facing them
Richard is slouched in dirty work clothes

PHIL HIRSCHKOP (CONTD)
And but for the interference
with his arrangement there would be
no cause for such marriages The
fact that he separated the races
shows that he did not intend for
the races to mix

Phil looks up from the paper and smiles at the Lovings
PHIL HIRSCHKOP (CONT’D)

I know it sounds strange but this
is really wonderful
Richard squirms in his seat not convinced

PHIL HIRSCHKOP (CONT’D)
By issuing this ruling Judge
Bazile has really given us a road
map to the Supreme Court

MILDRED
I’m sorry I’m confused He ruled
against us again

BERNIE COHEN
That’s right but now we’re allowed
to appeal this ruling to the state
From there if they rule against
you we’ll have a chance at the
Supreme Court

Richard just stays quiet Mildred nods politely

MILDRED
That sounds wonderful

BERNIE COHEN
Now a little bit of housekeeping
LIFE Magazine contacted us about
sending a photographer out to you
all Keeping the possibility of
the Supreme Court in mind I think
it’s a fair idea to raise the
profile of your case but I of
course want you all to be
comfortable with it

Mildred looks over to Richard who shrugs

MILDRED
That will be fine

BERNIE COHEN
Okay great We’1ll set that up

Mildred raises out of her seat and shakes Phil’s hand

OVER THE IMAGE

TEXT

Loving v Virginia made the prohibition of marriage based on
race unconstitutional The Supreme Court stated that
marriage is an inherent right

TEXT

Seven years after the Court’s decision Richard Loving was
killed by a drunk driver Mildred never remarried and lived
the rest of her life in the home Richard built for them
TEXT

Though shy of press and ever reluctant to be called a hero
Mildred was interviewed shortly before her death in 2008
She spoke of Richard saying “I miss him He took care of

me”

As wind passes through the leaves that look out over the
lower field Mildred walks over to join her family
