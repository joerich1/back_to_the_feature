FADE IN
INT SENATE HEARING ROOM - CAPITOL BLDG - DAY

Blinding in their white uniforms naval flag officers sit
in the audience showing their support for THEODORE HAYES
a 50-year-old civilian This is his confirmation hearing
Reading from prepared material

HAYES
last few years have brought many
advances in the interests of women
in naval service particularly in
the land-based maritime specialties
Whats more the Navy has instituted
special sensitivity courses with an

eye on --

DEHAVEN
Whoa whoa whoa Land-based
maritime specialties Gimme a

second here to de-euphemize that

At the center of a dais LILLIAN DEHAVEN leans back to
ponder the ceiling of the hearing room Her plaque card
reads CHAIRPERSON -- SENATE ARMS COMMITTEE DeHaven is a
tough-hided old Southern belle Scarlett OHara at 60

In her arsenal she carries conversational hand-grenades --
and shes apt to pull a pin at the slightest whim

DEHAVEN
Would that be anything like
typing Restocking the
cupboards That sort of thing Mr
Hayes

CHUCKLES from the packed gallery The flag officers go
stone-faced Hayes forces a smile

HAYES
Hardly the case Senator

DEHAVEN
Well Im just an old dame without
much time left so youll pardon me
if I jump right in here before they
discontinue my blood-type I am
deeply concerned over the Navys
seemingly incontrovertible attitude
toward women in the military Case
in point

On cue aides begin distributing reports to other members
of the dais Hayes gets a copy too And it jars him

DEHAVEN
The Lark Report

HAYES
Madam Senator this is an internal
document of the US Navy I must
seriously question whether --

DEHAVEN
(to others on panel)
The Navys conclusion regarding the
crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft
carrier Female aviator it just so
happens

(to Hayes)
Youre familiar with this report and
its conclusion am I right

HAYES
I was one member of the investigating
commission

DEHAVEN

Yes I see your signature right here
-- twice the size of everyone
elses And your conclusion was
pilot error hmm

HAYES
Im really not prepared for any kind
of in-depth review of --

DEHAVEN
Id like to think our next Secretary
of the Navy would be prepared for
anything Mr Hayes

A humorless smile Shes roasting his nuts over an open
fire and everyone knows it

HAYES
The commission concluded that the
aviator in question failed to
execute a proper approach to the
carrier

DEHAVEN

That aside for the moment Im
struck by the tenor the ill-spirit
of your report the degrading
remarks by other aviators
innuendo about her performance in
unrelated situations even a
reference to her sexual activity the
weekend prior

(closing report)
In my seven years on this committee
Ive never seen a downed aviator
treated like this Never Im
deeply disturbed by this report Mr
Hayes Not just what it bodes for
women in the military -- but for
your own confirmation as well

INT CORRIDOR - CAPITOL BLDG - DAY

Heading for her office DeHaven is escorted by a small
PRESS RETINUE

DEHAVEN
a full 35 percent of all jobs in
the US military are still to this
day off-limits to women And
thats simply gotta change

PRESS 1
What about those who say women
arent suited for all jobs That
theyre physically weaker they
have less stamina

DEHAVEN
Sure And were gonna hog the
bathroom too

DEHAVENS AIDE catches up pulls her aside

DEHAVENS AIDE
White House boys want a private
meeting

DEHAVEN
Ill act surprised

INT DEHAVENS OFFICE - CAPITOL BLDG - DAY

Shoes dumped on her desk DeHaven changes out knee-high
stockings while devoting one ear to

WHITE HOUSE 1

to reassure you that he has
every faith in the ability of Mr
Hayes to guide the Navy into the
next century The task as the
Administration sees it is to
acknowledge changing realities
without losing traditional values

A beat DeHaven looks between the two WHITE HOUSE boys --
1 young and eager 2 older and cagier

DEHAVEN
Zat it Ten minutes nothin on
the table Sweetcakes you best go
back to the President and tell him
to open up the phone book and start
lookin for his next nominee

White House 1 looks spanked Taking over 2 pops a
briefcase An inch-think report appears before DeHaven

WHITE HOUSE 2
Administrations plan for 100
percent integration If female
candidates measure up in a series of
test cases the President will
support full integration within
three years time

Surprised -- maybe even startled -- DeHaven flips through
the report absorbing by osmosis

WHITE HOUSE 2
Its your gender-blind Navy
Senator Surely youre not going to
balk now

DEHAVEN
Well its just that askin you all
to integrate the Navy is like
sending a man to do a womans job
(a beat)
How do you propose to handle the
Combat Exclusion Laws

WHITE HOUSE 2
Keep narrowing the definitions
Keep redefining

WHITE HOUSE 1
We got around it in Saudi Arabia

DEHAVEN
By calling women Honorary Men
Ingenious

WHITE HOUSE 2
Cmon Senator Presidents pitchin
right down the center of your plate
If women measure up to men theyve
got the job You going to take a
swing Or step out of the box

DeHaven riffles the edges of the report thinking it over
Thinking light years ahead

EXT CAPITOL BLDG - DAY
Buttoning up topcoats the White House boys move down
marble steps to reach a pair of limousines Hayes and two

FLAG OFFICERS wait

HAYES
Well

WHITE HOUSE 2
(shaking hand)
Congratulations Mr Secretary

INT HAYES LIMOUSINE - DAY

Inside the moving car

HAYES
So she picks the women we pick the
programs Seals

FLAG OFFICER 1
Id go Special Reconnaissance

Every bit as tough -- and we have a
60 percent drop-out rate among the
men

HAYES

Then I suggest we start there

FLAG OFFICER 1
Doesnt matter who she picks No
woman is going to last one week in a
commando training course And I
dont care who it is

EXT POTOMAC RIVER - WASHINGTON DC - DAY

Winterscape Dotted with ice floes the Potomac wends
through the capitol city banks iridescent with snow
morning water calm Theres an almost hallowed beauty to

it all Soon we pick out

A spot of day-glo Coming out of the mouth of morning
Overtaking the floes

CLOSER on JORDAN ONEIL She pushes her flat-water kayak
downriver paddling hard and clean making good time
Gliding through the graceful arches of the Arlington
bridge she passes

Cars overhead Grid-locked by snow conditions

In seconds Jordan paddles clear leaving the traffic
behind as she heads toward the Washington Monument
Something BURRS from a life-vest pocket She rips through
velcro to free a cell phone

JORDAN
Lieutenant ONeil

ROYCE (VO)
Gotta situation here Where are
you Stuck in traffic

JORDAN
(checking dive watch)
Not due in for 22 minutes sir
Watcha got

INT SITUATION ROOM - NIC - DAY

ROYCE
All right stand by were going to
switch over to COMSAT

A TACTICAL OFFICER reroutes the call via defense
satellite cryptography flashing on terminals Lieutenant
Commander ROBERT ROYCE joins other Intel officers at a
conference table Theyre pouring over weather charts
navigation logs high-altitude NRO video

TACTICAL OFFICER
Voice-system now secure

ROYCE

(into speaker)
Okay fresh stuff Lost a NATO
plane over the Sea of Japan ELB
signals leads us to believe the
pilot is alive and has made his way
to the North Korean shore near a
fishing village Tamyung

JORDAN (VO)
Do we know its him using the
beacon Not a decoy
ROYCE
Signals received only sparingly in
such a pattern that leads us to
conclude it is a downed aviator
trying to conserve his batteries

JORDAN (VO)
Chances of recovery

ROYCE
Youre the analyst for East China
ONeil Analyze

EXT POTOMAC RIVER - WASHINGTON DC - DAY

Riding the current Jordan blows a troubled sigh as
accesses the file of her brain Drifting past the
Jefferson Memorial

JORDAN
North Korean beaches are the best
protected most heavily monitored in
the world The civilian population
is so propagandized that it acts as
an Early Warning system Extraction
team has to be small and silent --
Id go with Seals over Delta Force
Problem is dont want to hold a
conventional sub off-shore for
target practice Wheres The Polk

INTERCUTTING
ROYCE
Halfway round the world So thats
the problem -- we can get the team

in just not out

JORDAN
(an inspired beat)
Unless you Whiskey Run

ROYCE
Blank faces here ONeil

JORDAN
Quick-hit technique used by Capone
Rigged a getaway car with running
boards and handles All his guys
had to do was jump on and take a
ride Check the files -- DPRK-57 --

she
I doped it out as a contingency
plan Seal Team infiltrates picks
up the package links up with
recovery sub But dont waste time
opening and closing hatches They
just grab the periscope and hang on
for neutral waters

A dubious beat

ROYCE
You expect the extraction team to
ride the sub bare-back Is that
correct ONeil

JORDAN
Only four minutes to neutral waters
sir Why not

Silence on the radio Theyre discussing her scenario
privately During Jordans kayak reaches the junction of
the Potomac and the Anacostia rivers On the far bank
lies

Naval Intel Center (NIC) bristling with communication
antennae

Jordan stares at the complex waiting for a response

ROYCE
All right sending the
recommendation across the river
Royce out

The phone goes dead
JORDAN

No thank you sir
EXT SECURITY STATION - NIC - DAY
Bundled in topcoat and scarves military and civilian
employees transit a security station on their way inside
Presently Jordan appears -- wearing a wetsuit and
balancing a collapsed kayak on her head She flashes a
photo-badge and double-times inside

INT CORRIDOR - NIC - DAY

Jordan exits a locker room Smoothing out her Khaki
uniform she heads down a broad corridor with cipher-lock
doors Falling in step

ROYCE
That was good headwork lieutenant

JORDAN
Thank you sir We hear back from
the Pentagon

ROYCE
(scoffing)
Probably hear back from CNN first

JORDAN
Hate this part Just sweating it
out on the sidelines

ROYCE
Intel has its own glory lieutenant
-- no matter how subtle

Now they reach

INT BULLPEN - NIC - DAY

A circular chamber Dominating the ground floor is the
bullpen a hive of cubicles an computer stations On the
second floor are executive offices ringing the bullpen

ROYCE
By the way Ill need that option
paper by 11-hundred today so I can
review it with Admiral Hanover And
do we have any of that breakfast tea
around here

JORDAN
(with a look)
Is this my glory sir

On the upper walkway a frazzled NIC SECRETARY
appears She spots Royce and Jordan below

NIC SECRETARY
Excuse me but I have Senator
DeHaven on the line for you

ROYCE
Jesus God what now
He bounds up the stairs toward his office

NIC SECRETARY
Im sorry sir no -- she asked to
speak with Lieutenant ONeil

Royce turns back and gives Jordan a hall-of-fame look
Oh really

INT DEHAVENS OFFICE - CAPITOL BLDG - DAY

DEHAVEN
(into phone)
So everyone I talk to says youre
top drawer with silk stockings
inside

JORDAN (VO)
Thank you maam Um may I ask
what this is regarding

DEHAVEN

(reading file)
High-school pentathlete ROTC

honors top marks in Basic
Training and as it just so
happens a constituent of my home
state of Virginia Oh the things
Ill do for one extra vote

INT BULLPEN - NIC - DAY

On the phone Jordan glances around Co-workers mull
within earshot Those out of earshot post E-mail memos on

Jordans computer Moving up in life I want a full
report Dont tell her who you really voted for
DEHAVEN

Lieutenant ONeil I am prepared to
nominate you for the Navys Special
Reconnaissance program Should you
accept youll ship out to Coronado

testosterone festival Complete the
course and youll have a fast
ticket to any assignment you want

INTERRCUTTING the two

JORDAN
Coronado

DEHAVEN
California

JORDAN
I know that sir Maam Its just
that Beggin your pardon
Senator but do you understand

that this involves combat training

DEHAVEN
This is just a test case ONeil
But if it works out -- if you work
out -- it could well change the

Navys official policy on women in
combat Or actually its official
non-policy Now whos your
immediate superior there

JORDAN
Captain Dwyer Technically

DEHAVEN
My office will fill him in and help
expedite Look forward to meeting
you at the proper time Jumping off
now

JORDAN
Uh question maam

DEHAVEN
Yes dear
JORDAN
Would I be the only one The only
woman
DEHAVEN
Therell be more to follow -- but

of a very large litter And your
success would mean a lot Jumping

The line goes dead Jordan hangs up catatonically

Beyond stands a clapboard rental house

INT JORDANS HOUSE - NIGHT

Its not so much furnished as equipped -- scuba gear and
wetsuits in the mud room life vests on coat racks a
training bag and boxing gloves hanging in the living room
In the kitchen we find

A naked man Hes steeping tea

JORDAN (0S)

and three brothers -- so I know how
to fight What scares me are the
sexual politics I dont want to be

Snow builds on a window sill Facing Jordan the man
slides into the tub

ROYCE
So whyre you even considering it
Are you

JORDAN

Royce massages her feet

ROYCE
Well youre doin shit-hot at

JORDAN
Royce Were the same age we
started the same time -- and now

youre sitting in the upperdecks
while Im still down in the bullpen
What does that tell you about the
Navy

ROYCE
(shaking head)
Shes haze grey and underway

JORDAN
You need operational duty to really
advance you need combat training
to go operational yet combat
training is off-limits to people
with tits Im topped out at Intel
Forget the glass ceiling -- Im
beating my head on a big brass
ceiling

ROYCE
So dump on me

JORDAN
This has nothing to do with you

ROYCE
(getting out)
Well guess I dont even need to be
here

JORDAN
Get your dick back here It has
everything to do with you

ROYCE
Youre such a ball-breaker
sometimes Especially at night

JORDAN
Sorry But after our days
(a thoughtful sip)
So if I try this thing if I ship
out to Coronado what happens
here

ROYCE
Ill try to keep the door open If
you wash out I make it so that --

JORDAN
Wai wait What happens if it
works Four months of training
three years of operational duty
What then

ROYCE
(blowing a sigh)
I dont feel like doing an option
paper on the rest of my life
Jordan Maybe we should just let it
happen

JORDAN
Which is guy-speak for

ROYCE

(conceding)
Sounded lame as soon as it came out
of my mouth But Im trying to be
honest okay Three years is a long
time Dont ask me to predict how
Ill feel then Jordan because I
dont know And either do you

JORDAN
You know right up until you said
that -- I thought I did know

Wounded she gets out

ROYCE

JORDAN
Thank you Royce It was shaping up
like such a tough call -- and then

you go and make it so goddamn easy
Really thank you so much

She punches into a robe and leaves Royce considers
drowning himself in the tub

certain amount of pain

Dismissed

Another smile another phantom gesture on the back of her
chair If Jordan was expecting a fight the bell never
sounded She rises salutes -- then turns back at the
door
JORDAN
Sir I just want you to know Im
not here to make a statement I
dont want to make men look foolish
All I care about is completing the

Other eyes quickly lock in on

Jordan Across a grass courtyard she walks the ground
floor of an identical building trying to match key number
to room number Every door is open every room empty
Soon she feels the presence of

The men Theyre disgorging from their rooms -- ten
twenty thirty of them -- all buffed and cut These guys
are what Hitler saw in his dreams

Jordan picks up her pace Where the hell is her room
On all three levels of their building the men shadow
Jordan en masse Not hooting Not leering Just
assessing

Jordan finds her room at the far corner of the building

Shes got the entire floor to herself With a last look
over her shoulder Jordan vanishes inside

Dead-ass tired Jordan slides her tray down the line
piling on food that means nothing more than raw calories
She heads for

A table of trainees one spot open Seeing her coming
the guys shift position Suddenly the table is full

ENGLAND
Better look elsewhere ONeil

Jordan glares None of them meet her eyes She wheels
around -- and now all eyes are on her watching her ass
walk away FEATURE Slutnik the walking sperm bank

Half a night Lord just gimme half
a night to set her straight

Jordan tries another table This one too becomes
abruptly full As Jordan leaves HOLD on Miller Hes a

They look at her with blank faces No understanding No
compassion

EXT BOQ - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Jordan walks in a bathrobe toweling her hair dry She
fishes for keys at her door
VOICE

smoking He leans into the light so she can see his face
Its Wickwire the mid-30s lieutenant who doubles as class
officer Hes dangerously handsome
WICKWIRE

Theyre more afraid of you

JORDAN
Well now I feel so much better

WICKWIRE
It was made clear before you came --
harassment equals career suicide
Cant say anything good so they
dont say much at all To your
face anyway

JORDAN
Whose orders were those
WICKWIRE
It was made clear
(getting up)
Anyway stay ballsy First weeks
hell then it levels out Until
SERE training anyway Thats
hell-and-a-half

JORDAN
And how do you know that

WICKWIRE
Made it to Week 10 last time

JORDAN
I didnt know they let you try

A faint grin from Wickwire before he shadows back across
the courtyard that separates the two BOQ buildings
Back across no-mans land

INT JORDANS BOQ - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Two beds Matching lockers A desk a chair a mirror
All overwhelmingly dull

Jordan drops the robe off her shoulders to take inventory
of her body Both sides of her neck are bruised from the
phone-pole run Her back and thighs are sand-burned
Mirror cuts abound Shes already a mess

Jordan uncaps some cologne Its a vestige of her old
life shes not going to surrender She sniffs Savors
Dabs Looks back in the mirror

And breaks out laughing Its like dropping a rose ina

EXT OBSTACLE COURSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

An explosion of sand England and Wickwire belly-flop
into a sand pit and speed-crawl under barbed wire Clear
they gain their feet and blitz toward

The rolling logs They balance-beam their way to

The rope climb Racing to the top they reach a platform
and fling themselves down onto

The high poles They land awkwardly losing their wind
and their grip tumbling into the sand pit below before

Racing for the finish The Chief thumbs a stopwatch

go for the slide-for-life

Wickwire dusts off and starts back for

fighting cock Jordan lines up beside him and psyches up
for the first obstacle -- and eight-foot sheer wall

INSTRUCTOR JOHNS
Hang on here

He grabs something off a truck and positions it at the
base of the wall Its a little two-step platform

SNICKERS MOANS from the guys Cortez can barely contain
his disgust

CORTEZ

Cortez blurs away Jordan starts a step late
Cortez takes the wall clean Eschewing the two-step
Jordan jumps right over it -- but jumps too far out

because of it She takes the wall awkwardly

INTERCUT the others as they break rank to follow eager to
see Cortez blow her off the course

CLASS
Lesgo Cortez LESGO GO GO

Cortez belly-flops into the sand pit -- and snags going
under the barbed wire

CORTEZ
Shit of a saint

Catching up Jordan clears the wire without a hitch and
leads going into

The rolling logs They both tight-rope across nimbly and
bound on toward

Rope climb Jordan starts up at a decent clip -- but
Cortez comes from behind like a chimp on white sugar
doubling her speed

CLASS
Take her take her here Cortez
lookit that monkey-man go hoo-

yah hoo-yah
Cortez reaches the top platform Now hes faced with
The high poles Hes seen others land sideways and pay

the price Trying another way Cortez takes a flying
leap
And WHUMPS down with legs astraddle He tried to cushion
the landing with his hands -- and failed magnificently
His balls took the brunt

Jordan WHUMPS down beside him with legs astraddle -- and
shoots Cortez a Hey no problem look She rolls off the
poles

And drops to the pit below Cortez lands right behind
Now its a flat-out sprint for

The finish line He takes her at the tape

on your gonads and line up again

resent your perfume however subtle

offend your goddamn fragile

integrating -- despite the rhetoric

It seems the men couldnt get used
to the sight of women blown open and
their viscera hanging from tree
limbs Israeli men would linger
over wounded females -- often to the
detriment of the mission often
endangering their own lives They
dont use women anymore

JORDAN

got it for

For pulling a 210-pound man out of a
burning barrack in Saudi Arabia

rescue another man hes a hero
But when he tries to rescue a woman
hes gone soft

THE CHIEF
Could you have pulled that 210-pound
man clear lieutenant

She cant say yes She wants to but cant

THE CHIEF
Females in combat situations impact
unit cohesion Men fight better
without women around And that is
an historical fact

JORDAN
It also seems like a problem with
the mens attitude sir So maybe
you should be sniffing around their

See me sir

The CO and XO are both here

(uncomfortable)

I dont know of any delicate way to
say this lieutenant so I wont
try Claims have been made that you
have engaged in fraternization -- of
the same-sex variety Specifically
that you were

seen leaving the apartment of
another female officer at such a
time and in such a manner as to
suggest conduct unbecoming

JORDAN
(a beat laughing in
relief)
Sir if someone is suggesting that
Im a lesbian theyre wrong

The C0Os face remains grim He isnt relieved

JORDAN
Theyre very wrong And Id like to
know where you got this information

On the C0Os nod the XO opens an adjoining office
Wickwire enters Hes stiff as a groom on a wedding cake

WICKWIRE
Im sorry ONeil But as class
officer its my obligation to
report all violations

JORDAN
This is insane Youve got no
proof

(from report)
You were seen leaving Ensign
Blondells apartment at
approximately 0-200 whereupon
physical affections were exchanged
in public

We hugged

In addition you have been seen
frequenting the base exchange the

Wickwire exits

JORDAN
Sir I just want you to know that
this is either a gross mistake --
or someones vindictive bullshit
In no way did anything happen
between Ensign Blondell and myself
Were just friends

X0O
So youre saying the charges have no
validity whatsoever

Jordan opens her mouth to confirm -- and hesitates
realizing where this might be headed What the collateral
damage might be

JORDAN
Im saying were just friends

co
I find this as distasteful as you
lieutenant But if its on my desk
its on my shoulders Theres going
to be an inquiry -- it will not be
quick and it will definitely not be
pretty You should prepare
yourself

JORDAN
Sir please if theres any way to
do this without dragging everyone
through the mud

co
I dont see how ONeil Dismissed

Jordan moves to the door Again she makes eye-contact
with Blondell Now we understand why shes so scared
Theres a witch-hunt brewing

Sir If tomorrow I was not under
your command would the inquiry

still go forward

Im not sure what --

Would you have the discretion to end
it right then and there

Shes offering her own head on a silver platter -- and the

talk but now is scarcely --

Did you set me up Did you set me
up just to see me fail

Absolutely not

DeHaven glances back at the doors to the Senate chamber --

DEHAVEN
Wickwire was there to help To be
my eyes on the inside to make sure
you were getting a fair shot At
least that was the intent

JORDAN
What changed

DEHAVEN
Should probably ask him that

JORDAN
If I have to ask again Senator
Ill be asking in front of cameras

Its a threat DeHaven doesnt appreciate The Senate
DOORKEEPER appears

DOORKEEPER
Madam Senator Your esteemed
colleagues are requesting --

DEHAVEN

Two seconds Walter

(answering Jordan)
In 1981 the Supreme Court was
asked to rule on the issue of women
in combat positions The Court
cited the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws
as a legal foundation for keeping
women ineligible That decision
held for all these years -- until
the White House 10 days ago moved
to have the Exclusion Laws voided
To demolish that legal foundation

JORDAN
So Isnt the President jumping on
your bandwagon

DEHAVEN
What he did was light the bandwagon
on fire Because he knows what I
know -- that American families are
not prepared to put their daughters
in harms way

JORDAN
You dont know that

DEHAVEN
In face I do Roper Harris
Gallop -- they all come back the
same

JORDAN
What are you saying That a womens
life is more valuable than a mans
That a womens death hurts a family
more

DEHAVEN
Im saying its not going to happen
Not when the President is set to
turn this into a third-rail issue
should I choose to ever campaign
against him He will fry me six
ways to Sunday for sending daughters
and young mothers off to war -- and
quite possibly for bringing them
back in body bags

Jordan shakes her head in disbelief She has met the
enemy -- and she is us

JORDAN
You were never going to let women
serve in combat You always had a
safety net Or thought you did

DEHAVEN
Jordan I dont expect you to fully
understand this -- but sometimes

theres more to be gained from the
fight than the victory

JORDAN
So the rhetoric gets you headlines
But the reality gets you in trouble

DEHAVEN

The reality is this We send far
too many men off to war I dont
need to compound the problem with
women

(off Jordans look)
Can you honestly tell me you wanted
that life Squat-pissing in some
third-world jungle with --

JORDAN
I wanted the choice The chance to
prove myself my skills my work
me Thats how it shouldve been
DOORKEEPER
Madam Senator once again I must --

DEHAVEN
Just hold the goddamn clock Walter

Not happy about it the doorkeeper reaches into an alcove
grabs a broom he keeps around for just these occasions
He enters the chamber

INT SENATE CHAMBER - CAPITOL BLDG - DAY

and moves behind the rostrum Holding the broom by

And uses the broom handle to turn back the Senate clock by
three minutes

good on that Come work for me I
can always use a hard-charger on my

too

DEHAVEN

Ive had no direct communication
with him since this whole thing
began And thats quite verifiable

JORDAN
Im sure it is

DEHAVEN
Youll think about my offer

JORDAN
You know I wonder what the SecNav
would think about it If I spoke
with him
DEHAVEN
Well I spoke with Mr Hayes this
morning myself -- and told him the
deal was off No more test cases
He was only too happy to oblige
(dangerously low)
Dont play politics with me little

darlin Youd be up way past your
bedtime
DOORKEEPER
(distraught)

Madam Senator please

DEHAVEN
Ill call you in a few days

EXT CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

50 feet down the helo lies canted on a reef shelf

INT CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

Wedged into a tortured maze of hydraulics and equipment
we find the Chief operating out of an air-pocket near the
windscreen The pilot is dead impaled on his cyclic
stick head submerged The co-pilot is still alive
barely The Chief struggles to keep the mans head up as
he keys a survival radio

THE CHIEF
Got one other heartbeat here looks

JORDAN

(into radio)

EXT CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY
Again the Chief goes below water He finds a small breach
in the fuselage sticks the flare launcher through
and pulls the trigger

With a MAGNESIUM FLASH the flare launches

INT CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

ONeil Our airs gonna crap out as
soon as we get down there You know

JORDAN
So I guess we get one shot at it

INT CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

Swimming in his own blood the Chief starts to fade away
losing consciousness But then through the cockpit
windscreen

A hazy orb of light above him The orb grows and grows
until it resolves into a flare carried by his would-be
savior Jordan

THE CHIEF
Whyd it have to be her
EXT CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

Reaching the downed Helo McCool and Cortez wedge their
oars under the fuselage and leverage hard until

An opening appears

Jordan and Flea swim into the breach

INT CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY
and surface inside the wreckage

JORDAN
Chief sir still with me

CHIEF
(unbuckling co-pilot)
Take him first Once hes clear

JORDAN

orders and start doing exactly what
I say because thats the only way
were all getting out of here Now
hows your vest check out Still
good

EXT CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

McCools air craps out He abandons his oar and swims for
the surface That leaves only

Cortez struggling mightily to keep the escape route open
He knows his mini-tank is running on empty -- and it
scares the bejeezus out of him

INT CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

JORDAN
Flea take the pilot up slow feed

Cortezs air goes dead He gives it three more seconds
eyes riveted on the underside of the helo knowing they

have to come out right fucking absolutely

NOW Jordan appears with the Chief Flea is at their
heels with the co-pilot

Cortez drops his oar as if it were radioactive and swims
for the sky

The HELO BOOMS back down onto the reef

Jordan yanks the cord on the Chiefs vest It inflates
instantly One arm raised Jordan streaks for the
surface

EXT OCEAN - DAY

and Supermans into daylight with the Chief They
covered 50 feet in four seconds

Doing a 360 Jordan spots
Seafox One coming their way
Jordan waves like a shipwreck victim

Not slowing Seafox lowers a recovery rig into place
Theyre wasting no time on the pick-up

Remembering the last time she tried this Jordan gets a
death-grip on the Chiefs vest

THE CHIEF
(growling)
ONeil

JORDAN
Shut up sir Im concentrating
The recovery loop comes at her like a big brass ring

SEAFOX THUNDERS past Jordan plunges her free arm through
the loop

And suddenly theyre gone whisked away by the boat

Throwing a rooster tail a mile long Seafox pivots on the
water and heads back to base

All buffed and polished and wearing their dress whites
the former trainees erupt with ONE GREAT HOO-YAH What
began as a class of 100 now ends with just 40

Sitting among the families and friends we find Royce
smiling through his fears Not far away sits Blondell
No one claps louder

Jordan trades high-fives and fierce hugs with crewmates
Pyro finally manages to take her aside

INSTRUCTOR PYRO
Lieutenant I was asked to give you
this

Its a small case Jordan opens it to find a medal of
bronze and blue enamel

JORDAN
The Navy Cross

INSTRUCTOR PYRO
believe he earned it for saving a
mans life in Saudi Arabia He
wanted you to have it He was very
clear on that point

JORDAN
I was looking for him earlier
but

INSTRUCTOR PYRO
The Chief was granted early
retirement as of 17-hundred
yesterday By 18-hundred he was
gone Out of the Navy

JORDAN
(knowing better)
Just a coincidence

INSTRUCTOR PYRO
Maybe its not my place to speculate
on his private thoughts But I
think the Chief knew that his way --
his world -- had come and gone

Jordan nods understanding

DeHaven Shes holding a press conference trying to turn
piss into wine -- and doing a pretty good job

DEHAVEN

of course we always prefer
peace to war But if were going to
war give women a piece Give them
the choice to defend their country
And if the President doesnt like
that idea -- if he wants to continue
to deny women their equal rights --
then Ill be happy to step out back
with him any time anywhere

Jordan approaches Spotting her the PRESS PLEADS for a
photo-op with both women

DEHAVEN

Letting silence be the ultimate expression of scorn
Jordan walks right past DeHaven

Look Its not like youd be
completely out of reach And maybe
we could call in a few favors get
you stationed at Norfolk instead of
Coronado There are ways of dealing
with these things -- I mean if
people are so inclined
JORDAN
(warily)
Which is guy-speak for

ROYCE
Yes Jordan -- Ill wait for you no
matter how long

Finally the right answer

EXT AIR STATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

START TIGHT on Jordans face Even beneath the camouflage
paint we can see her exhilaration PULL BACK to find her
in a line of commandos boarding an IDLING C-130 Shes
embarking on her first mission KEEP PULLING BACK until
weve lost her completely -- until shes just one soldier
among many indistinguishable from the rest

FADE OUT
