FADE IN

DRAWER POV Two men stare down at the camera which is

looking up through a small
breaks waist-length with the pair looming over it

KALYPTO is a younger
expression

rectangular depression that

unkempt man with jaded eyes and a bored
He wears shabby clothes and cultivates a

permanent five oclock shadow to go with his shaggy uncombed

hair

WILSON is a middle-aged thug His expression as he stares
down at the mystery depression is bewildered

WILSON
That has got to be the single
weirdest freaking thing I have ever
seen in my life I mean seriously
That beats the hell out of David
Copperfield

KALYPTO
Yeah I can see youre absolutely
filled with childlike wonderment
Can we hurry this along New
Zealands playing for their second
World Cup in an hour I dont want
to miss the first scrum

WILSON
Scrum Is that like a curse

KALYPTO
No Its rugby

WILSON
You watch rugby

KALYPTO
What about it

WILSON
Nothing Its just Thats so
normal I mean--

KALYPTO
Normal What exactly do I look like
to you

WILSON
No its just that I thought

KALYPTO
What
WILSON
Well That you youre like--

KALYPTO
Spit it out

WILSON
« « a demon S

KALYPTO
Just make your deposit man

WILSON
Sorry

KALYPTO
Yeah

Wilson carefully places a bulging velvet sack inside the
depression His expression turns apprehensive

WILSON
Its not going to evaporate in
there or anything Youre sure
Theres like a half-a-million
dollars sitting in that bag my
friend

Kalypto reaches inside his shirt He pulls out a necklace
hidden beneath it Keys dangle from the chain keys of
varying sizes and description He detaches one and hands it
to Wilson

KALYPTO
Hold onto this key When you need
me again itll know And dont
worry so much Theres nothing in
this world that can screw with my
mojo Okay

Wilson examines the key then stares back down at the
depression

WILSON
I dont see a lock here

KALYPTO
Does this seem like the time to be
so literal

WILSON
Well I guess not but--
KALYPTO
Think of it as a charm if that
helps you

WILSON
Yeah all right Cool
COP (0C) S
You two Freeze Police
Kalypto and Wilson turn away toward the voice

CUT TO

EXT INDUSTRIAL ROAD - CONTINUOUS

The two stand in the middle of a long deserted road
surrounded by warehouses There is nothing between or in
front of them Whatever they were peering inside of whatever
Wilson placed the sack into it has apparently disappeared
into thin air

KALYPTO (VO)
My name is Kalypto I open drawers

(beat)
Its a lot more complicated than it
sounds
FADE TO
STRANGER THINGS TITLE SEQUENCE
CUT TO

MONTAGE

Everyday drawers are opened Desk drawers chest of drawers
file cabinets a cold storage drawer in a morgue a public
storage unit etc

KALYPTO (VO)
Its just a simple concept taken to
a very complex extreme thats all
Im not a magician or some kind of
warlock I dont know what the hell
I am anymore really other than
Im not mortal
INT SQUAD CAR - DAY

Kalypto sits hands cuffed behind his back in the back of a
police squad car as it speeds through the city streets

KALYPTO (VO)
Ive been around a long time And
as long as Ive been around Ive
been an opener Maybe youve always
been able to play the violin Or
maybe youve always been able to
make weird noises with your mouth
Whatever

Kalypto shifts He uses his teeth to pull the necklace he
wears out from under his shirt He bites down on a small one
not unlike a handcuff key and detaches it from the necklace
He cranes his neck and drops it over his shoulder and behind
his back Catching it he frees one of his hands slowly and
as quietly as he can

Kalypto removes his necklace He sorts through his pockets
for various personal effects

The squad car slows to a halt ANGLE through the windshield
The traffic light at an intersection turns red Outside we
see a DISTINCTIVE SIGN or ADVERTISEMENT (well come back to

this)

KALYPTO (VO) (CONTD)
The point is there are these small
S empty pockets in space and time
and Ive always had the ability to
open and close them

He waves his hand deftly A black paper-thin slate unfurls
above his lap seemingly from thin air It is a small
horizontal rectangle that remains there perfectly suspended

Kalypto has opened a drawer

He drops his personal effects They tumble into the blackness
of the slate but do not fall through the bottom and come out
the other side With another wave of his hand the slate
furls back into nothingness closing the drawer

Kalypto slips his hands behind his back and re-cuffs them
The squad car rolls on
KALYPTO (VO) (CONTD)
And as far as I or anyone else
knows thats my purpose For
whatever its worth Which aint
much believe me

All the drawers and cabinets that were pulled open are closed
in the same order each SLAMMING home with authority

END MONTAGE ON SLAMMING JAIL CELL BARS

INT JAIL CELL - DAY
Kalypto sits looking too tired to be pissed

GUARD
You got anybody you can call

KALYPTO
Nobody I want to admit this to

CUT TO

INT JAIL CELL - NIGHT

Kalypto sits alone in a drab county holding cell lost in
thought Its been hours

PAN (0C)
The being who opens Universal
drawers trapped in a man-made box
Oh the irony

Kalypto looks up Standing outside the bars is PAN male
around the same age as Kalypto Unlike Kalypto however Pan
is well-groomed and impressively attired He wears a large
medallion around his neck on a platinum chain

As the camera pans Pan is suddenly inside the cell with
Kalypto

PAN (CONTD)
(looking around inside)
I dont know The neighborhood S
isnt that good but I guess you
cant beat the rent

KALYPTO
How did you know I was here Pan
PAN
Oh everyone knows Kal

KALYPTO
Everyone What the hell Pan You
guys can traverse the celestial
veil travel to dimensions beyond
Human imagining and yet you got
nothing better to do than sit
around bagging on me

PAN
What can I say This world is a
dreary one And yet here we are
confined seeking entertainment as
we can

KALYPTO
Yeah I know Youve got to walk
your beat Thats one thing we all
have in common

PAN
So you want me to get you out of
here

KALYPTO

What will it cost me
Pan laughs
PAN
If I need to squirrel something

away Ill call you

KALYPTO
Go to hell

PAN
We can if you want

Pan smiles mischievously

INT CORRIDOR - LATER

A portly GUARD trudges up the corridor of the cell block
checking each cell through its door Halfway through his
rounds he stops performing a double take through one door
particular

Kalyptos cell is empty

in
The guard gets on his radio

GUARD
Uh I got problem on six

EXT SIDEWALK - NIGHT
We see the DISTINCTIVE SIGN from before S

PAN (V0O)
Might I make an observation

KALYPTO (VO)
No

PAN (V0O)
I feel springing your lower-echelon
ass from the hoosegow entitles me

Pan and Kalypto enter the frame already talking

KALYPTO
(sarcastic)
Really You feel entitled Youre a
door opener and you feel entitled
Thats that is shocking Im

shocked An arc-lancer with a sense
S of entitlement Now Ive truly seen
everything

Kalypto moves away his back to Pan He looks around and
WAVES a HAND A drawer slowly opens in front of him

KALYPTO (CONTD)
Make your damn observation already

Kalypto dips his hand inside and pulls out his necklace of
keys

PAN

Youre not happy Youre
discontent Theres a deep-seeded
misery within you that has extended
to all things Kalypto

(beat)
Youre freaking depressed is what
Im saying

Pan waves a hand and a tiny white hole tears in the space
above his hand - a little rubber ball drops into his palm
KALYPTO
You open a door to my soul or
something

As Pan talks he tosses the ball lightly away from him
gets further away it disappears into another tiny white
portal After a moment another portal opens and the ball

flies out toward him
Hes playing catch with himself

PAN
No its more your secondhand
clothes poor sense of personal
hygiene and choice of
companionship Present company
excluded obviously

KALYPTO
That was out of my hands I was
doing what Im supposed to do

PAN
Please

Pan tosses the ball and it disappears for good

PAN (CONTD)
You were caught stashing stolen
goods from a jewelry heist for
gods sake It belittles us all

KALYPTO
Look we were dealt different
astral hands here all right You
open doorways to other worlds I
open drawers The only people who
need drawers opened are people with
something to hide Its not like I
have a choice of clientele This
isnt a business I go where Im
needed And if you havent noticed
this world hasnt exactly become
less jaded with age Secrets lies
stolen shit Its piling up out
there

PAN
Those are limitations youre
imposing upon yourself my friend
You used to be fun you know that
Way back when It was all a game
Cosmic hide-and-seek

as it
Another of Pans tiny portals appears over Kalypto and the
tiny rubber ball drops into his hand Kalypto looks at it
hands it back to Pan

KALYPTO
The game got old Pan

PAN
Well you were tolerable to hang
out with at least

KALYPTO
Yeah well

One of the keys on Kalyptos necklace begins to glow

PAN
Youre being summoned

KALYPTO
No shit

Pan turns and strides away

KALYPTO (CONTD)
Pan

Pan stops turns

KALYPTO (CONTD)
Thanks for getting me out

Pan grins drops into an overly-low bow
Light FLASHES on Kalyptos face and when it recedes -
PAN IS GONE

But in that same burst of light the rubber ball BOUNCES
across the street rolls and hits Kalyptos feet

KALYPTO (CONTD)
-Yyou flashy bastard
EXT CHEAP MOTEL - NIGHT

Kalypto walks across the pavement looking for the right
door He holds the key as a sort of subtle divining rod

Turns left - turns more right and stops in front of a door
Knocks

The door is ripped open

WILSON
Hey

Wilson stands nude but for a towel wrapped around his waist
He is just out of the shower cast in the light from an open
motel room door

WILSON (CONTD)
What took you so long man Ive
been working that key mojo you gave
me for like an hour Cmon in here
Quick

INT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Wilson enters followed by Kalypto The room is disheveled
Empty liquor bottles and strewn clothes both male and
female litter the furniture The beds sheets and comforter
are piled high atop the mattress

KALYPTO
How did you get out of jail so
fast

As Wilson answers he goes back into the bathroom

WILSON
Hey I could ask you the same
question right Me I had the law
firm of Goldman Goldberg and
Green on retainer Now Im not
one to pigeonhole an entire
culture you understand but leave
it to a trio of Jews to get you
bail with a half a dozen priors in
your jacket Know what Im saying

Wilson re-enters wearing a pair of sweat pants and an old T-
shirt

KALYPTO
Thats one way to do it I suppose
(beat)
So You rang

WILSON
Yeah I got a different kind of
stash job for you

(MORE)

WILSON (CONTD)
Nothing you havent done a million
times Im plenty sure but this is
all new to me

KALYPTO
What are you talking about

Wilson grabs a handful of the comforter and tears it away
with all the flourish of a magician pulling a tablecloth from
beneath a china setting

A FEMININE HAND

with long manicured fingernails falls over the edge of the
mattress BLOOD rich red and arterial has spread to the
four corners of the bedsheet The body soaking in it
possessed pleasing curves and a mess of blonde curls The
woman must have been very attractive before she was
butchered

WILSON
Meet Lila I need you to stash her

for me S

ACT ONE BREAK

INT WILSONS HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Blood pools around LILAS dead body

Kalypto is livid His initial shock quickly mutates into
horror

KALYPTO
What have you done

WILSON

What I think every man really wants
to do when a relationship ends
badly

(beat)
Maybe I went overboard But there
were special circumstances in this
case

KALYPTO
What the hell are you talking
about Why

WILSON
Bitch dimed me She was the only
one who knew about our meeting

KALYPTO
What did you do

WILSON
Well I didnt end things amicably
thats for damn sure

Wilson lies down on the bed beside Lila completely
undisturbed by her condition He angles his face close to
hers

WILSON (CONTD)
I probably couldve let that go
But she wouldnt even say she was
sorry Just kept denying it I
cant abide people who wont admit
their mistakes Especially women
Drives me nuts You know what Im
saying

Kalypto meanwhile has regained some composure

KALYPTO
I guess so

Wilson stands

WILSON
So listen at first I was thinking
you could sock this bad boy away
for me

Wilson opens one of the motel rooms dresser drawers and
removes a bloody knife store at the bottom of a clear plastic
bag He holds it up in front of Kalypto

WILSON (CONTD)
Hard to make any kind of solid case
with no murder weapon right But
then when I really started kicking
it around it occurred tome
why not just stash the bitchs
body the sheets the whole fucking
mattress if necessary You can open
a drawer big enough for me right

The words dont seem to be registering with Kalypto almost
as if he cant quite force the concepts they express into the
receptors of his mind

WILSON (CONTD)
You all right there Can you do
that

KALYPTO
What

WILSON
Stash the body in one of your
little dead pockets Only this
would be a big dead pocket
Emphasis on big and dead

KALYPTO
You want me to open a drawer
for what For her body For a
person

WILSON
Yeah Is that a problem

KALYPTO

WILSON
Whats wrong Dont tell me this is
your first stiff

KALYPTO
Ive seen death Centuries of it
But what youre asking me here
isnt thats not my purpose
I dont contribute

WILSON
Whatever man Theres gotta be a
first time for everything Can you
accommodate me here or not

KALYPTO
I cant--
WILSON
You know man Ive got to be
honest with you here Your whole S

demeanor is starting to worry me I
mean at this point where were at
now youve really only got two
choices Youre either an
accomplice or a witness

Wilson opens the bag reaching inside and withdrawing the

knife

He examines it meaningfully and then points its razor

tip at Kalypto

WILSON (CONTD)
Im pretty sure youre close enough
to immortal that taking you out
would be tough But you are flesh
and blood And that means you feel
pain the same as Lila there did
You know what Im saying

KALYPTO
Yes I just need to work out the
logistics Its a tall order You
know

Wilson seems placated He slips the knife back inside the
plastic bag

WILSON
Yeah sure no problem Just you
know she aint getting any fresher
and check-out is at noon tomorrow
so lets make this thing happen
soon all right

KALYPTO
I hear you

WILSON
Good deal Youre my man Or
whatever you are You know

Kalypto only nods

EXT MOTEL PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

Kalypto exits Wilsons motel room He half-staggers aimless
and disoriented for a few feet and then abruptly VOMITS

As he stumbles off we enter the motel WINDOW of the next
room over -

CUT TO

INT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Cartoons play silently on the shoddy television set of a
cheaply-furnished motel room ALAN FEATHERSTONE early-to-mid-
thirties kneels in front of his son SETH who is slight and
perhaps eleven years old

ALAN
Do you remember the story of S
Abraham and Isaac Seth

Seth doesnt answer his father His attention is drawn
instead to the open bathroom door of the motel room Nothing
is visible inside but the sink mirror the curtained tub
and other fixtures Yet Seths expression is one of dread

ALAN (CONTD)
Hey Seth Look at me buddy
(angrily)
Look at me Seth

Seth looks at his father Alan forces a calm back over
himself

ALAN (CONTD)
Do you remember the story of
Abraham and Isaac From Sunday
school when you were smaller

SETH
Yes sir
ALAN
Good Thats good Can you tell it
to me
SETH
Isaac was Abrahams son And God
S told Abraham to take him to a

mountain As a burnt offering But
Abraham didnt want to do it

ALAN
Thats right Because he loved
Isaac He loved his boy his only
son more than anything in the
world Just like I do So what
happened then

SETH
Abraham took Isaac to the mountain
to kill him But the Angel of the
Lord appeared and told him not to
Because he knew then Abraham loved
the Lord And they killed a ram
instead

ALAN
Yes The Lord gave Abraham a ram to
sacrifice in place of Isaac

(MORE)

ALAN (CONTD)
Because he knew Abrahams love for
him was so great But the sacrifice
had to be made Thats what fathers
do And sometimes its not easy
Sometimes God doesnt give you a
ram

We move inside the bathroom past the curtain of the shower
LISA FEATHERSTONE is bound and gagged and curled up at the
bottom of the tub Her wrists are tied together as are her
ankles She struggles against the nylon cord binding them
but it holds firm

ALAN (CONTD)

I know you love Mom I love Mom

too But shes sick Seth Her soul
S is sick And shes forcing me to

make a big sacrifice so you and I

can be together Shes forcing me

One day youll understand that I

promise

Giving up on trying to free herself with sheer force Lisa
strains her neck above the rim of the tub and searches the
confines of the bathroom frantically with her eyes They
settle on the mirror hanging above the sink She stares at it
meaningfully for several moments then looks at the door A
plan has formulated behind her eyes

Shifting her weight she struggles to get up to her knees
while not making any noise Stretching her body over the edge
of the tub she extends her bound arms toward the door
directly behind Alan Finally reaching it she quickly shuts
the door and depresses the knobs cheap locking mechanism

The sound of it SLAMMING home draws Alans attention sharply

ALAN (CONTD)
(to Seth)
You stand right here Dont move a
muscle You hear me

Alan stands and walks to the door of the bathroom He tries
the knob with no success

ALAN (CONTD)
Lisa Unlock the door honey Dont
do this now

On the other side of the door Lisa flops roughly over the
tubs edge onto the floor Winching she grips the edge of
the sink and uses it to boost herself up to a standing
position Balancing carefully with her ankles still tied
together she pulls a fresh towel from the motel rack

Alan begins POUNDING on the other side of the door

ALAN (CONTD)
Lisa open this door right now

Lisa wraps the towel tightly around her hands Bracing
herself she SMASHES the mirror above the sink with her
linked fists It SHATTERS raining jagged pieces into the
basin below

The sound only enrages Alan

ALAN (CONTD)
What the hell are you doing Lisa
What is that Dammit unlock this
door Unlock it now

Lisa selects a long pointed piece of broken mirror and uses
it to hurriedly cut the bonds around her ankles and wrists
Free of them she yanks the gag from her mouth

Seth has crept from the bed behind his father

ALAN (CONTD)
I told you not to move

Seth freezes fear and tears fighting for space on his face

ALAN (CONTD)
Its okay Seth Thisll all be
over in a minute

Alan BUSTS OPEN the door with one violent kick He steps
inside the bathroom with murderous intent only to be stabbed
in the shoulder by Lisa striking from a blind corner and
wielding her broken piece of mirror like a blade

Alan HOWLS in pain He stumbles backward from the bathroom
and falls bleeding in sudden torrents down his shirt

ALAN (CONTD)
You bitch Im going to kill you -

Lisa darts past him grabbing Seth by the hand and pulling
him frantically out of the motel room

ALAN (CONTD)
Dammit Lisa Seth Im not a bad
man Seth I just want to protect
you

EXT MOTEL PARKING LOT — CONTINUOUS

Lisa hand-in-hand with her son charges out of the motel
room and two flee across the parking lot

A moment later Alan appears in the doorway soaked in his
own blood and insane with rage He attempts to run after her
but hes in too much pain He collapses SCREAMING the names
of his wife and son with the same fury

INT BAR - DAY

A key GLOWS on Kalyptos necklace He drops it on the bar
ignoring it

KALYPTO
This one wants me to hide a body
for him

Kalypto and Pan sit at a stained wood bar with tall pints of
beer in front of them Pan drinks heartily while Kalypto
merely nurses his

PAN

As I said before you sleep with

the pigs you wake up in shit S
KALYPTO

You said it more poetically last

time
PAN

Well its becoming clear my poetry
is wasted on you I learn from my
mistakes Unlike you

KALYPTO
Thats very friendly of you

PAN
Kal were not friends I talk to
you because its better then
spending forever not talking at
all But if you keep it up Ill
S just go disappear and leave you to
your whining

KALYPTO
Thanks

Pan downs his drink

PAN
Im going to help you I dont
know why because you dont deserve
it but Im going to anyway

KALYPTO
How are you going to help me

PAN
This is not a problem you can solve
with talking You have to do
something

KALYPTO
Yeah what do I have to do

Pans medallion starts to glow

PAN

Oh this is perfect The timing is
too perfect -

(he slides his medallion

under his shirt)
You have to take an interest It
isnt going to find you you have
to find it

KALYPTO
What

PAN
Im talking about charity work

EXT PARK — SUNSET

Lisa sits beside Seth on a park bench She surveys their
surroundings with constant alarm She is stroking and
fiddling with a talisman much like the one Pan wears

SETH
Its going to be okay isnt it He
can get us away like he did
before Where Dad cant find us
this time

Lisa tries to smile convincingly for her son

LISA
Yeah baby its going to be okay

SETH
I shouldve done something Back
there I shouldve protected you

Lisa consoles him

LISA
Its not your fault Seth None of
this is

Suddenly the wind picks up blowing through the trees and
bushes and tossing the fallen leaves around the bench Lisa
and Seth stand cautiously watching the strange happenings

The ARC begins to open a curtain of magnificent light
ascending from the ground directly in front of them The
ethereal doorway shines A figure begins to emerge from it
It stands there arms outstretched ceremoniously bathed in
the arcs radiance

Lisa and Seth stand in irrepressible awe and dread Seth
subtly steps in front of his mother

Pan steps from it The top of the arc descends closing the
doorway and snuffing out its light Kalypto is left there in
its wake standing behind Pan As Pan moves aside Lisa spots
Kalypto and eyes him suspiciously

LISA (CONTD)
(to Pan)
Who is he

PAN
Oh just another traveler like
yourself Lisa Theres nothing to
fear

LISA
Nothing to fear He found us again
Alan He almost how does he
keep following us You sent us to
that other place And then
back here He wont stop

PAN
I am not the only being on this
plane with my kind of power Lisa
and your husband is a very
determined man That kind of
obsession can bypass many barriers

LISA
Ive given you everything I have to
give And you promised you could
get us away from him

PAN
And I did Twice Can you truly
rest the blame on my shoulders
Lisa For this man who is your
husband

LISA
Im sorry

Pan enfolds her in his arms like a priest and holds her
His voice is a soft whisper

PAN
Thats all right

Kalypto has to lean in to hear her soft reply

LISA
We need to get away from him for
good Ill do anything Just please
help us

Pan releases her

PAN
of course my dear Of course I
will Be at this address at
midnight tonight The stroke of S
mind you Not a second before or
after Ill have everything
prepared

Pan gives her a small card Lisa takes it She leads Seth off
hurriedly The immortals watch them depart

KALYPTO
What did I just witness here

PAN
Its thrilling isnt it The
desperation The willingness The
instincts both maternal and
survival Mortals are such complex
and yet utterly predictable
creatures

KALYPTO
That woman was scared out of her
mind And the kid he looked
shell shocked

PAN
Both are entirely warranted Her
husband the boys father is quite
mad Violently abusive obsessed
with them both Dogged Equally
willing and instinctual Equally
fascinating creature

KALYPTO
Whats your stake in it

PAN
They may be tiny lives Kal but
they need my help And its
something to do Youll find the
years pass faster if you dont
spend them thinking about yourself
all the time

KALYPTO
Doesnt it seem like itd be
easier to be mortal You could
tell yourself there was a reason
for it all if you didnt have to
live to see there wasnt one

PAN
They are worrisome little
creatures But theyll figure
themselves out in the end - or
theyll die and then they wont
have to worry about it And
neither will we

Pan shrugs as a key on Kalyptos necklace begins to glow

KALYPTO
Son of a bitch

Similarly Pans medallion glows

PAN
(grins)
It never ends Think about it
Kal Charity work

KALYPTO
(studying the glowing key)

I had an offer earlier and Ive
S been thinking about it ever since

Maybe the only way any of this has

a reason is if it has an end So

I suppose the question isdo you

know ifcan we die

He looks up Pan is gone

KALYPTO (CONTD)
Son of a bitch

EXT MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT
Kalypto walks across the dingy parking lot of a motel

A muffled BLAST draws his attention to one of the motel room
doors An intense WHITE LIGHT suddenly shines through the
seams in the door jamb a light not at all unlike that of the
arc Pan opened

This realization is not lost on Kalypto

KALYPTO
(to himself)
What the hell

When the light has dissipated he stealthily approaches the
door MUFFLED VOICES can be heard from inside the room
Kalypto peers through the edge of the window shade

ANGLE through the window Pan stands in front of the bed
magnanimously obscuring a figure seated there He is
speechifying After a moment he steps aside

Another man is seated on the foot of the bed He is
shirtless His wounds have been hastily bandaged

It is Alan Featherstone
ACT BREAK
Kalypto presses his ear to the door jamb
ALAN
I have to find them Tonight
Wherever theyre going Look at

what she did to me Shes got my
son

PAN
I have to say Im beginning to
seriously question your devotion

Alan
ALAN S

How can you say that Ive been
nothing but penitent in your
presence

PAN
I told you Alan desire alone
doesnt open doors to that which
you want most Doors that traverse
all mortal boundaries Doors to
other worlds It takes total
commitment Total devotion You had
them back in your custody Youd
reached the end of your journey
And you let them slip away Im
beginning to think my efforts were
wasted on your plight

ALAN
I didnt let them do anything Look
at me

PAN
What Do you honestly think losing
a few cups of blood and shedding
some flesh amounts to a sacrifice
Let alone a sacrifice worthy of the
divinity Ive bestowed on you
Twice no less Do you think these
arcs just fall out of my blessed
ass son

ALAN
Please Ill do whatever you say

PAN
You must deliver her to me Alan
Thats the only way now Thats
what I require

ALAN
Whatever it takes Just help me
find my son again Please help me
find him Youre the only one in
this world who can help me I need
your grace Please

PAN
Deliver her unto me Make the
sacrifice worthy

ALAN
I will Thank you I wont fail
this time I swear

Pan hands him a card like the one he gave Lisa

PAN
Be there at 1205 sharp Not one
minute before or after Do you
understand

ALAN
Yes Lord

Kalypto stands back from the door obviously in shock

The blinding white light of another celestial portal once
again seeps through the motel room door and then dissipates
Pan has apparently departed

alypto stares down at the door to Wilsons apartment and
hen inside the room Alan is gone but on the bed is a
Bible and a wicked-looking knife

Kalypto backpedals away from the door numb He treks slowly

to the center of the parking lot and stares up at the sky at
the hangmans moon his dead gaze darting from star to star

Its as if he is searching for something among the celestial

bodies that define the heavens S

Whatever it is Kalypto eventually seeks it out Or it seeks
him out A new calm washes over him Perhaps a sudden
catharsis And it brings tears to his eyes

EXT STREET CORNER - MOMENTS LATER

An everyday pay phone Kalypto walks past it determined a
man on a new mission out of frame We stay with the corner
After a moment he walks back into frame He to it and takes
the receiver out of its cradle He dials 9-1-1 and waits for
the operator

KALYPTO
Yeah Im at a motel on the corner
of Babylon and Talmont
(beat)
Thats right
(MORE)

KALYPTO (CONTD)
I just heard a woman screaming next
door and a mans voice and things
breaking It was horrible
Something bad has happened to her
I think you should send the police
Its room 114

He starts to hang up the phone - pulls it back again -

KALYPTO (CONTD)
(improvising terribly)
I think he said his name was
Wilson

He hangs up the phone

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT

Lisa and Seth wait in the darkened heart of a dead end alley

SETH
Its spooky here cS)

LISA
Its all going to be okay baby
Were leaving this bad place soon
Were going to go somewhere your
Dad cant find us

SETH
He always finds us

LISA
Not this time I promise Okay

A celestial arc OPENS tall and bright before them bathing
Lisa and Seth in its radiance Pan steps ceremoniously from
the rectangular field of immaculate light S

Lisa stands to face him taking Seths hand in hers once
again

LISA (CONTD)
Is it time

PAN
It is

LISA
He wont be able to follow Youre
sure this time

PAN
Those kind of absolutes dont
exist Lisa Not in this Universe
Now you and Seth should hurry The
door will close soon

LISA
Where will it take us

PAN
Somewhere beautiful And safe

KALYPTO (0S)
Just like in the brochure right
Pan

The three of them turn toward the opening of the alley as
Kalypto enters it

PAN
Kal What are you doing here

KALYPTO
Playing the game

PAN
(to Lisa)
You need to go Now I cant keep
the arc open much longer

KALYPTO
What he means to say is that Im
ruining the time table for his
rabbit hunt

PAN
Kal

LISA
(to Pan)
What is he talking about

KALYPTO
A five minute head start Lisa
Thats what he wanted to give you
Just to make it sporting enough

LISA
Five minutes Until what
ANGLE ON the street Alan storms the alley entrance

the small congregation including Lisa and Seth

KALYPTO

How do you think your husband has
been able to follow you and your
son wherever these doors take you
Did he acquire a mastery of
interdimensional portals overnight

(to Pan)
Is this what you call charity
work

PAN
My friend here is confused Lisa
Hes something of a trickster
thats all

KALYPTO
Im not the one with the satyrs
name old buddy

PAN
Kalypto youre making a terrible
mistake Now why dont you take a
deep breath followed by a few
steps back and we can talk about
this later

KALYPTO
What over a couple of brews where
you tell me how it is Im done

being comic relief Pan Youve had

enough amusement

PAN
This isnt about you and your
inferiority complex you twit Its
about this woman and her innocent
little boy here Who are currently
running out of time

KALYPTO
By whose watch dickhead

PAN
Im warning you Kalypto

ALAN
Lisa

He spots

All heads turn toward him Lisa immediately steps in front of

Seth
PAN
(to Lisa)
Hurry Through the door Now Im
trying to save you and your child
you miserable woman Take him
through the door

Lisa looks at him then at the tall shining arc

S LISA

No No more running

PAN
Dont be a damn fool

LISA
No

Pan relents disappointed The radiant arc folds in upon
itself and blinks out

ALAN
(to Pan)
You found them

LISA
(to Pan)
You son-of-a-bitch

ALAN
Give him to me Lisa Seth buddy
come here
Seth picks up a piece of discarded wood from the alley

SETH
No

Pan removes himself casually from the situation leaning
against the alley wall and shaking his head

PAN
What a waste

ALAN
Come here Seth

SETH
No

LISA
Stay away from us

ALAN
Give me my son damn you

Kalypto steps between Alan and his terrified family

ALAN (CONTD)
Who are you

KALYPTO
Just another celestial hustler

ALAN
Get out of my way

KALYPTO
Not angelic enough for you I
guess
ALAN
(to Lisa)
Who is he The new guy youre
screwing

Alan cocks his fist and drops Kalypto with a brutal right
hand to the face Kalypto motions with his hand A thin black
slate appears beside Alan It is suspended horizontally in
midair waist-level with him This drawer is tall and wide
enough to accommodate a man

Alan stares into the apparent nothingness

ALAN (CONTD)
What the hell is that

Kalypto picks up a piece of rebar lying on the alley floor
and stands

KALYPTO
Its a coffin in space asshole

Alan turns toward him Kalypto swings the piece of rebar as

if hes wielding a folded katana It strikes Alan across the
jaw sending him sprawling backwards into the seemingly paper-
thin depths of the drawer Kalypto has opened His body does
not pass through it It does not fall from the bottom
Instead it disappears into the blackness of the slate

A second later the slate disappears as well
Kalypto stares at the space the drawer occupied a satisfied

S expression on his face Hes unprepared when Pan grabs him
from behind and hurls him to the hard pavement

He straddles Kalyptos prone form and begins pummeling his
face with closed fists

PAN
You have completely fallen from any
S form of grace recognizable to our
kind you piddling little box
jockey

KALYPTO
Yeah I heard all about your
goddamn grace I dont know what we
were put here to do anymore but
its not to run these people around
like rats in a maze so we can get
off when were having a slow
century

Kalypto tries to break free of him but Pan shoves him back
down with authority and holds him there

PAN
You know better than anyone the
places I can send you Kal I can
open the door to endless hells I
can toss your sorry ass into a
dimension made of teeth dripping
with shit

KALYPTO
Pan youre a —

Pan BASHES him in the face again

PAN
Do you know what you are Kal In
the rank and file of the Universe
in the pecking order of its
locksmiths youre just a
secretary You file the tiny
forgotten things the useless
bullshit that not even the lowliest
creatures could possibly have use
for What do you think of that

Instead of denigrating him Pans words seem to inspire
Kalypto His opens his hands held fast to the filthy ground
A new drawer opens above Pans head this one the length and
breadth of the mans shoulders It is not an ordinary
drawer however It is a raging wormhole of light that
collapses inward

S KALYPTO
I think youre absolutely right
Pan

Pan looks up As he does the drawer implodes decapitating
him His head is not severed it is swallowed disappearing
with the drawer There is no blood no gore no apparent
wound It is as if his head and neck have simply been erased
from existence

The summoning charm that hung around his neck drops on
Kalyptos chest a moment before Pans headless corpse
collapses on top of him He rolls it off of himself and sits
up Lisa and Seth are staring at him in abject shock and
horror Seth is crying Kalypto looks back at them with
sorrow and uncertainty

KALYPTO (CONTD)
Its okay Its going to be okay
now For both of you

Lisa begins sobbing as well

LISA
Nothing is okay Its never going
to be okay

Kalypto is at a loss He can only sit there watching Lisa
and Seth hold each other and cry together He looks at Pans
headless body blankly at first Then some sudden meaning
some realization seems to come to him

KALYPTO
Lisa

LISA
What

KALYPTO
Do you believe that do
you that believe a man well
maybe not a man but close enough

S for our purposes do you

believe he could take all of a
persons pain and darkness and bad
memories and put them in a tiny
little drawer and shut it tight so
that they could never hurt anyone
again

LISA
No But I think the world would be
a much better place if that were
possible

KALYPTO
S Maybe it would be
(to himself)

Maybe it would be

FADE TO

EXT PUBLIC PARK - DAY

Its the kind of perfect spring day that seems like a dream
or a postcard from Somewhere Else The sunlight is too
ethereal for the real world the people too bright and

shining and happy S

Lisa and Seth picnic on the green grass They are all smiles
and laughter as they enjoy the day Theres no hint of the
violence or terror that has filled their past

Suddenly a shadow is cast over the both of them a mans
shadow tall and broad through the shoulders Lisa and Seth
stop what theyre doing They look up

Alan stands there looming over the both of them
He smiles

Lisa and Seth return the smile Alan kneels upon the grass
and kisses his wife Lisa kisses him back willfully and
enthusiastically Seth looks on embarrassed and happy and
not at all afraid Alan joins his family and the three
picnic together in peace

Kalypto sits in the shade under a tall tree watching them
from a distance He has cleaned himself up His hair is
combed Hes clean-shaven His clothes arent as ratty or
worn But more than any of that his eyes arent as wearied
anymore The spectre that haunted his face is gone

He smiles too
After a moment more of watching them Kalypto rises from his

spot beneath the shade of the tree He lingers then walks
away into the sunlight into a better world

FADE OUT
