INT COURTROOM DAY

Lenny begins to pan the jury as the Judge
gives his instructions

LENNYS POV THE JURY

THE JUDGE
The defendant is charged with
violating section 3116 of the
California Penal Code which
provides Any person who
knowingly speaks any obscene
song ballad or other words
in a public place is guilty of
a misdemeanor

In hispanning Lenny has just passed a Lady in a

Flowered Dress who is looking at him and not at the

Judge He pans back to her and notes her look of
obvious distaste

LENNY

Ughn-oh

146 CONTD CoNTD 146
ANOTHER ANGLE - JUDGE

Who has stopped a moment to frame his explanation
as best he can for the layman Lenny scribbles
furious notes and keeps shoving them t his
Attorney

JUDGE
Nowobscene means to the
‘average person applying
contemporary standards of the
community The dominant appeal
of the matter being to arouse
prurient interestwhich is a
morbid or shameful interest
in nudity sex or excretion which
goes substantially beyond the
limits of such matters and is
matter that is utterly without
redeeming social importance
Now sex and obscenity are not
synonymous In order to make
sex obscene it is necessary
that the portrayal of it must
be done in such a way that
its dominant tendency is to
corrupt the average adult
