Tenth draft - July 1204
FADE IN
EXT OCEAN BEACH NORTHERN EUROPE 500 AD -- DUSK 1

CAMERA swoops along a shimmering black sand beach mountains
rising in the further distance

FINDING in the middle distance EIGHT WARRIORS galloping on
HORSEBACK armed with spears swords shields netting
torches

DOGS race along at their sides

At the head of the troop rides a grizzled mid-aged WARRIOR
grimly determined his face obscured by his battle mask

The warriors race on riding to beat the devil home
EXT MEADOW -- DUSK 2

With the sun gone below a ridge of barren hills the darkness
is quickly retaking the ground bleeding out from the
crevices of rock the moss a stream twisting through the
emerald meadow

in the middle distance of which GOATS and SHEEP amble
about

Beyond them rocky outcrops give way to a dark and shifting
sea and the low RUMBLE of surf

Into the foreground there slowly shifts a huge stooped
FIGURE Erect hed be nearly seven feet tall and is twice
the mass of an average man covered in hair - much of it
greying Immense arms lead to massive hands the tough nails
tools for a brutal existence

His face - or what can be made of it in the falling light -
has a leatherish quality It also betrays age as does a
noticeable limp this is a gigantic nocturnal primate - a
troll who has seen better days

He scans the meadow puzzled He CLUCKS his tongue a couple
of times GRUNTS out a name of some sort

FATHER
Grrruhnellll

He twists his head to one side raises his nose and sniffs
the wind wary for a moment then the moment passes

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 2

He shuffles forward a few more steps still searching worry
now edging in He CLUCKS his tongue again --
and hes slammed from behind by something --

-or as it turns out someone his small child - GRENDEL -
who promptly tumbles past his father CACKLING at the prank

From the distance comes the sound of a DOG BARKING

The father snatches at Grendel He misses tries again and
it becomes a little chase

Finally the father scoops up Grendel and berates him in with
several low guttural words - a primitive tongue with echoes
of Old Norse

Grendel responds by grabbing his fathers nose and twisting
it laughing The father then laughs too

But once again the father grows wary Holding Grendel close
he sniffs the air More BARKING DOGS

then the far-off SHOUTS of HUMANS
The father urgently swings Grendel up onto his shoulder and -
fear overcoming his infirmity - with great strides he crosses
back out of the meadow toward the rock outcrops
EXT BEACH -- CONTINUOUS 3

The troop of warriors race along

till the lead warrior pulls up eyeing the rocks to either
side He sniffs the breeze considers

the others waiting on his judgement

then he abruptly jerks his horse toward a break in the
rocks leading up into a meadow

the other warriors following
EXT WILDS -- CONTINUOUS 4

Grendels father is moving as best he can but one hip is
giving him trouble and his wind is quickly going on him

Grendel stares back over his shoulder his face now betraying
the same fear his father feels

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 3

They scramble over rock twist along moss paths then down
into a stream then up the bank up past massive
boulders the sound of the DOGS and HORSES edging ever
closer

EXT SHORELINE CLIFFS -- CONTINUOUS 5
The two trolls emerge into view of the sea Grendels father
rushes up to the cliff edge and verballygesturally directs
Grendel to descend

Grendel starts down a few feet before turning and meeting his
fathers fierce gaze He gestures to Grendel to continue
down Grendel does but steals a glance back up to find

-his father turning to meet their pursuers Grendel climbs
back up to the cliffs edge to see

-the warriors charging in on horseback Several dismount
and take positions on the periphery

The lead warrior continues forward Now we see hes
significantly older than the rest there are years of these
sort of battles in him And yet the fire is still in his eye
- even as it meets the trolls

The other warriors hold back waiting on their leaders move

The troll scowls back a snarl escaping

The lead warrior unfazed even spurred on by the challenge
charges forward and flings a leather bag at Grendels father

The bag - hitting - bursts apart throwing liquid pitch over
him As other warriors rush forward with torches

Grendel twists back down into the rocks terrified
There come the SOUNDS of a vicious FIGHT above the ROARS
of his father the warriors SHOUTS and the BARKINGWAILING
of dogs the NEIGHING HUFFING and STOMPING of the
horses
A dog flies past over the cliff to the rocks below
Then a sudden WHOOSH a terrifying SCREECH

and Grendels father staggers off the cliff stuck with
spears wrapped in netting and engulfed in FLAMES

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 4
5

His body twists down and SLAPS onto the rocks below where
it lies motionless burning until the first wave washes
in extinguishing the flames
Grendel gasps as

-TORCHES drop through the air on either side continuing
down to the rocks below - the warriors seeking confirmation
of the kill

Their CHEERS of celebration wash down over Grendel and he
looks up to see

the lead warrior peering down into the dark a spear
raised ready to throw his figure silhouetted against the
torch-lights

What Grendel does not see

is the warrior nudge up his battle-mask

REVEALING the wild battle-eyes of the Danish king - HROTHGAR
50 His ferocious gaze softens turns to puzzlement
Hrothgar squinting makes out

the tiny troll figure of Grendel nestled in the rocks

Hrothgar is clearly torn He gulps in a breath His hand
tightens in grip on his spear his mind racing

Grendel buries his face in his arms
Finally Hrothgars puzzlement shifts to decision He wipes
the troll-blood from his eyes Pity overtakes him His

spear-arm drops and he turns away

Grendel burrowed into the rocks steals a glance up to
find

the warrior gone from the cliffside the sounds of the
hunt-party diminishing

But the sound is replaced by Grendels own sobs
EXT SHORELINE -- DAY 6

Grendel comes warily down the stony beach gaze sweeping
about in search hands dragging an old sword

Finally his gaze falls on what hes been searching for

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 5
6

the CORPSE of his father washed up in the rocks He
fights back sobs and struggles to dislodge it but the
corpse is too heavy

He resolves himself then raises the sword and swings it
down repeatedly onto the corpses neck

Exhausted and crying he takes up the severed head - a great
weight for him - and cradles it in his small arms

DISSOLVE TO
INT GRENDELS CAVE 15 YEARS LATER -- EVENING 7

ON the desiccated HEAD of Grendels father positioned in a
crude alcove-shrine on either side of which small smudges
burn

The fires have somewhat preserved the head the eye sockets

are empty and the flesh is gone from the face but the skin
has dried and tightened the long wild hair remains matted

over and beyond the great brow the yellow teeth clenched in
eternal gringrimace

Sea-shells stones and dried flowers are placed around the
head

REVEAL Grendel now an adult squatting down near a larger
fire-bed of embers gaze fixed on his fathers head his
own thoughts clearly melancholic

A breath rolls through him like a shudder He rises
revealing his stature hes huge with powerful limbs the

scale of his father but with none of the infirmity He

starts up a rocky path toward the faint light of the cave

entrance

EXT GRENDELS CAVE SHORE CLIFFS -- EVENING 8

Grendel emerges out onto the cliff edge and stares down at
the crashing water on the rocks below

-menace rising in his glassy-gaze he squats down

-snatches up a fist-sized rock and smashes himself once in
the forehead

Blood streams down from his brow and across his face He
licks the blood as it reaches his lip Grunts a bitter
SIGHLAUGH at his wretched state Blinks through the blood
at

the sun edging down into the sea

He wipes the blood over his cheeks chin brow - a battle-
mask in the making

EXT ABOVE THE DANISH VILLAGE PERIMETER -- EVENING 9
With the light fading from the sky

-the sounds of a CELEBRATION LAUGHTER MUSIC drift up
from the village

A CROWD of VILLAGERS circle about

-SNORRI 60s who lifts a blood-stained pine-branch from
the opened chest of a slaughtered ram lying on a rock

Hrothgar 60s now goes down on one knee before him Though
greying he wears his added years as well as any warrior-king
could
Snorri touches Hrothgars forehead with the blood
SNORRI

Hrothgar much-loved King of the

Danes under Odins eye I blood you

lucky on all paths that leave this

hall
A CHEER from the crowd
Hrothgar rises smiling and turns to his grand hall

His radiant wife - WEALHTHEOW 40s - hands him a clay jug

Hrothgar pulls the cap from it with his teeth and pours wine
out across the steps As it splashes down

HROTHGAR
May all those who cross these steps
find a happy heart
More CHEERS rise up from the villagers

Hrothgar draws his sword and smashes the jug sealing the
blessing

-and as the villagers line up to be - in turn - blooded
by Snorri Snorri bursting out in resonant SONG

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 7

REVEAL THE LS POV as that of Grendel rising over a rock in
the foreground His expression is solemn He sniffs the air
deeply

A shudder runs through him at the sound of the song the
rising of a mission in his gaze and in his blood

EXT DANISH VILLAGE PERIMETER WALL -- NIGHT 10
With some RAUCOUS drunken ROARS and HOWLS echoing through the
village and - at some distance - REVELLERS making their
swerving way back to the longhouse

a lone torch-lit GUARD moves along a boulder ridge spear
in hand grinning at the drunks But then an ANIMAL HOWL

rises rom the darkness beyond to which he turns

GUARD
Come near here yshitbrain wolves
youll get a mouth of spear

Theres movement in the stones below just beyond the
boulders just out of sight The guard peers over

Nothing for several beats but then a strange BREATH-LIKE
sound on the wind

GRENDEL
Speee-arrrr

The guard takes the torch from the holder in the stone holds
it out into the darkness trying to figure whats below

Several small stones hit him in the face and he jerks back
in surprise

GUARD
(wary mutter)
What the
The guard throws the torch down into the darkness

Something large deftly shifts out of sight to one side

Theres a scratching of nail on stone as something climbs up
the boulder

GUARD
Olaf Pal

The guard swings his spear toward the sound but without his
torch he cant see much Then again theres silence

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 8
10

The guard moves to the edge his spear high ready to stab

-- but from the side a large dark LIMB swings out the hand
slapping the guard in the face The thin CRACK of bone
snapping

The guard drops shudders briefly then his body goes still

OMITTED 11

INT MEAD HALL -- MORNING 12

LIGHT bleeds in with the CREAKY opening of the huge door
REVEALING

the nights carnage broken benches the BODIES of several
slain warriors blood splashed about

ANGLE BACK ON Hrothgar standing stunned in the doorway
with UNFERTH 30 a sturdy and well-scarred Danish warrior
to one side and AESCHERE late 60s Hrothgars peer to the
other Hrothgar with Aeschere at this side determinedly
edges forward over the slippery wood

Unferth - hungover and bloodstained - an awkward step
behind

HROTHGAR
Where were you when all this --
UNFERTH
(awkward)
Asleep Id Id had some
beers
AESCHERE

No others saw what happened

UNFERTH
None who can speak

HROTHGAR
(through his teeth)
What fucking thing would dare --

But his words end and his steps slow

Hrothgar stunned crosses the floor past the dead fire-pits
to a slumped FIGURE on the throne at the far end of the room

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 9
12

Its the guard from the wall one hand clutching his spear as
in readiness his hood hanging over his face

Hrothgar edges up takes up a spear and with its point
lifts the guards hood - gasps - and jerks back

Rolling off the shoulders - where his head should be - is a
bloody head-sized stone It hits the floor with a great
THUMP and rolls across it coming to a stop at Hrothgars
feet

ON Hrothgars face his horror giving way to a grim
realization

FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN

EXT OPEN WATER ISOLATED BEACH -- DAY 13
CAMERA slowly sweeps over sea-water coming to rest

ON BEOWULF 30 or at least his head seeming to eerily
bob on a plank of wood on the surface of the water

The odd wave splashes over him his eyes closed face
betraying no life then suddenly a long SIGH of exhaustion -
and relief

His eyes flicker open he blinks and slowly edges in toward
land his neck shoulders torso inch-by-inch revealed

-watched by a lone FISHERMAN on the beach mending his nets

Beowulf delirious pushes aside the wooden plank limps up
onto the sand trailing seaweed his shins and thighs
burdened by lamprey EELS attached to his flesh

He wears a battle-weathered leather tunic shredded tweed
pants a baldric-strap tying his sheathed sword to his
back

His body though battered and scarred is obviously one of
great power His wobbly-kneed stagger still manages the
grace of the warriorathlete returning from a struggle which
nearly killed him

FISHERMAN
Gday

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 10

13
BEOWULF
Gday Id owe much to know my
whereabouts
FISHERMAN

Fish Beach but likely Im the
only one who names it that

(off Beowulfs look wry)
Where I get fish

The fisherman goes to his fire-pit and takes from it a
smoking stick

BEOWULF
I mean whos your king

The fisherman looks back across the land considers it

FISHERMAN
Well yknow how these things go

As he talks he indicates various directions and movements
with his stick

FISHERMAN (CONTD)
Late as a couple years ago I think
it was a Hathobard Swedes rolled
in pushed them out Hathobards
came back pushed them out - then
they got pushed out by Geats
Wulfings showed up

(beat sighs)

Sig Skullsplitter of the Hathobards
was spilling blood this way last
spring But then he got sick from
sleeping with the sheep Swedes
came back

BEOWULF
(hint of worry)
Its Swedish land then

FISHERMAN
I wouldnt bet a fish on that
Hygelac the Geat then lay a beating
on the Swedes

(beat)

I had a boatload of Wulfings wash
up But they were just corpses
Stunk to Valhalla

(MORE)

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 11 13
FISHERMAN (CONTD)

Had to letm dry out a week then I

put the whole little crowd to flame

- not knowin what they died of eh

(beat shrugs)
Yeah Ill be guessing this is Geat
land for now

Beowulfs relief is apparent

FISHERMAN (CONTD)
Sleep with that canya

BEOWULF
Being a Geat
(nods)
Im Beowulf

By Beowulfs look its clear he expects his name to
register but - just as clearly - it doesnt

FISHERMAN
Beowulf what the Eel Meal

The fisherman nods to Beowulfs eel-infested shins Beowulf
looks down gets dizzy and drops to the sand where he sits

BEOWULF
Youve not had another wash up
Like myself name of Breca

The fisherman shakes his head As Beowulf talks the
fisherman methodically starts poking and singeing the eels
with the stick they unclasp from Beowulfs bloodied flesh
and drop to the sand where they squirm till the fisherman
whacks them dead

BEOWULF (CONTD)
We were out hunting whale the other
day Storm came up and ate our
boat Breca bet he could beat me
to shore I lost sight of him in
the swells

The fisherman tries to fathom this

FISHERMAN
So this is just you coming in now

Beowulf nods The fisherman gives a dubious look

BEOWULF
Yever swum in the open sea

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 12 13

FISHERMAN
Leave that to my boat

Beowulf stares a beat at the fisherman

BEOWULF
Am I right to think you mock me

The fisherman considers Beowulfs grim manner and his sword
He starts to gather the eels and throw them in a pot

FISHERMAN
Cant see much life in that
(beat)
You do this a lot

BEOWULF
I take what comes

FISHERMAN
Good Then youll have no qualms
if supper tastes like you

Beowulf stares The fisherman gives a battered-tooth grin
EXT FISHERMANS HUT -- NIGHT 14

The fisherman pokes at his fire while Beowulf nibbles at a
plate of the cooked eels

FISHERMAN
So whats it like being a hero
Quelling things with axes and that
sword of yours in - what - a
kinda bloody madness

Beowulf chafes slightly

BEOWULF

In truth I dont get all that mad
FISHERMAN

Thats all Ive heard of your sort
BEOWULF

You should hear what they say about

fishermen

They trade a wry grin The fisherman stirs the fire

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 13
14

FISHERMAN
So a hero eh A hero for
supper Dont my shit shine

The fisherman notices Beowulfs squeamishness with the eels

FISHERMAN
(eyeing Beowulfs plate)
Eat up Be yourself

And the fisherman cackles at his joke
EXT FISHERMANS HUT -- DAY 15

Beowulf and the fisherman stand before a rack of dried fish
The fisherman is packing some in a small pouch which he then
hands to Beowulf Beowulf claps him on the shoulder

BEOWULF
Im in your debt

FISHERMAN
(shrugs)
Im in the fishes
(grim to the water)
One o these days theyll come for

theirs

BEOWULF
Good luck May Aegir keep you from
hunger

FISHERMAN

Good luck with your killing things
I guess you thank - who - Thor

BEOWULF
Thats uh not all I do --

FISHERMAN
No Im sure ypiss and shit just
like the rest of us Gotta say

(off his look)
Hitting things with axes Youghta

BEOWULF
Daneland

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 14

find

a smoldering ruin of a HUT a few SHEEP about

FISHERMAN
Ch yeah word from the whale-road
they got one unhappy troll on the
loose there

BEOWULF
(dismissive)
Id think the Danes could handle a
troll

FISHERMAN
Guess the first eighty thought so
too

BEOWULF
(jolted)
Eighty
FISHERMAN

Well yknow how these things go
Some say twenty some say two
hundred

BEOWULF
Two hundred

FISHERMAN
Yeah it bent my brain too
thinking that many Danes could even
hold a sword

BEOWULF
(sharp)
I know the Danes Theyve bloodied
seas

The fisherman reads the ferocity of Beowulfs emotion

FISHERMAN
Eh Im just a fisherman

Beowulf looks out over the water torn

EXT PATH RUINED HUT -- DAY

looking MEN are eating at a fire-pit

He edges forward eyeing the smoke

They eye him warily

Beowulf strides along a sheep trail crosses over a ridge to

FIVE rough-

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 15
16

FIRST MAN
Dragon came in the night

BEOWULF
(playing surprise)
Dragon
FIRST MAN

Never heard of dragons

BEOWULF
Oh Ive heard Just always
thought they were tales
(glancing around)
And it left without the sheep
(off their looks)
Just seems odd from what Ive
heard of dragons to leave a
sheep

They offer shrugs

BEOWULF (CONTD)
So who are your people
(off their looks)
I know most Geats And this being
Geat land --

FIRST MAN
Whats it to you

Beowulf then spots some movement further back behind a
woodpile

His hand slides to the hilt of his sword

The first man fixes on the magnificent hilt - a sword of some
renown He eyes Beowulf with more concern

FIRST MAN (CONTD)
Thats some sword You have a
name

BEOWULF
I dont know yours you likely
wont know mine Beowulf

The others react - looks shooting amongst them - a name they
know and fear

Furtively they reach for their own weapons

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 16 16

BEOWULF (CONTD)
Maybe your dragon came back
And Beowulf edges up the slope toward the shed
-till he spots a MAN on the ground humping something
As Beowulf nears he makes out

-the limp arm of a woman extended over the rock and only
jerking with the thrust of the man

The scenario becomes immediately clear to him the burned
hut the dead woman

He draws his sword and directly advances on the bandit
group

-all of whom now brandish weapons - though defensively
The first man stumbles back his movement putting the lie to
his words

FIRST MAN
Go now you can go with your life

BEOWULF
This is my life
(ironic mutter)
A bloody madness

And he charges forward swinging his blade immediately
slashing the first man to the ground

A second man comes and after a couple of traded sword-
strokes Beowulf grabs the others sword-arm and then cuts
him down too

A third man comes at Beowulf who blocks his sword-swing
grabs the wretch by the throat and crushes it in his hand

The last two from the fire-pit group now have clearly
panicked expressions Nonetheless they come at him with
their swords

Beowulf routinely meets their strokes then snatches hold of
one throws him into the other then decapitates both ina
stroke

The headless clutching corpses then shudder to the ground

Beowulf turns and marches up the slope

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 17 16

The necrophile having just secured his pants starts
scrambling up the slope WHINING fear

Beowulf follows for a few beats - and gaining ground - then
heaves his sword into the air

It sails some distance before descending and catching the
necrophile in his leg He tumbles to the ground SCREAMING

Beowulf strides up to him pulls his sword from the leg
NECROPHILE
(a plea)
She was dead

BEOWULF
Yeah She was

And Beowulf swings his blade down upon the wretch
EXT HUT -- LATER 17

Beowulf places the dead woman - wrapped with care in a wool
blanket - into a shallow grave

Blood is splattered over his face and clothes but the
wildness has left his eyes now he looks only weary

The CRACK of a branch behind him and Beowulf twists about
ready to fight

-but finds a CHILD 6-7 face tear-streaked fear in his
eyes

CHILD
Are you a dragon queller

Beowulf considers shrugs

CHILD (CONTD)
You quell children

Beowulf shakes his head The child eyes his mother

CHILD (CONTD)
She might be scared here with these

men
BEOWULF

Dont worry Crowsll come for

them

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 18
17

CHILD
Then shell be alone

BEOWULF
The godsll watch over

CHILD
They didnt before

Beowulf cant argue He continues gently covering the body
the child approaching and helping to pat down the earth on
the grave

EXT HEIGHT OF LAND -- DAY 18

Beowulf comes up over a ridge on foot leading a HORSE on
which the child sleeps Beowulf smiles his gaze finding

EXT GEAT MEADOW SHORELINE -- DAY 19

a group of tents and SEVERAL DOZEN GEATS cooking fires
sending smoke to the skies MUSIC and LAUGHTER drifting up to
the hills

Its an annual gathering place - large standing stones set in
a great circle and

-across a black beach to the water A COUPLE of LONGSHIPS
lie at anchor

EXT GEAT MEADOW FIREPIT -- DUSK 20
With a LONGSHIP silhouetted in the background

-Beowulf sits almost central at a firepit - opposite his
king - HYGELAC 50s - surrounded by a cluster of Geat

warriors

the great standing stones looming over them like
guardians the firelight already throwing wild shadows

Among the Geat warriors is BRECA 30 almost as sturdy as
Beowulfand beside him HONDSCIOH late 20s Beowulfs
best friend and sitting to Beowulfs right

In Beowulfs lap the exhausted child is curled asleep in
spite - or because - of the raucous warrior band

All of them have been - and are still - drinking and eating

A short distance away a group of Geat WOMEN are LAUGHING
and TALKING among themselves

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 19
20

THORKEL 30 the Geat poet stands before the men with his
harp playing a powerful melody His manner is serious self-
absorbed ignoring the questionable attention of some of the
others His voice rises resonant hypnotic

THORKEL
In a game to gut boredom Great
Beowulf and Breca

Hondscioh rolls his eyes snorts derision Beowulf smiles at
him

THORKEL (CONTD)
-hoisted their hopes on the
seething sea

HONDSCIOH
Only cause they lost their sail

Breca casually smacks Hondscioh hard in the arm Hondscioh
mockingly plays great pain Grins from some but Thorkel is
undeterred

THORKEL
The whale-road white as the tongues
of trolls

BRECA
(at Hondscioh
appreciative)
Hear that The tongues of trolls

HONDSCIOH
Arses more like

This time both Beowulf and Breca raise their hands to strike
Hondscioh who winces duly preparing for the hits which -
this time - do not come

THORKEL
The two fire-hearted friends fought
on Steel-shirts a goad to
gruesome things That crept up
from their water-worlds --

HONDSCIOH
Hold it there
(to Beowulf and Breca)
Youre in the boat
(off their looks)
Things are going at you while
youre still in the boat

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 20
20 20

Beowulf shrugs eyes Breca Hondscioh follows his look

HONDSCIOH (CONTD)
Breca You tell Thorkel that

BRECA
Hondscioh next time youre alone
on open water just remember not to
drink it --

BEOWULF
---again

The roars of LAUGHTER stir the child Beowulf rises and
carries the child to a bed of furs nearby

HONDSCIOH
Any fish with any smell would sniff
you two and heave

LAUGHTER

HONDSCIOH (CONTD)
Next time you tell a tale Thorkel
try to sift the sheepshit out

THORKEL
I sing what Im told

HYGELAC
The song might well be stronger
than the bones its built upon

Nods from the cluster Thorkel is clearly miffed

THORKEL
They bring me giants Ill sing of
giants I can only work with the
bones Im given

Breca fires a look at Beowulf - who furtively indicates - no
nothing more happened no thugs were killed

HONDSCIOH
You want bones well bring you
bones Troll-bones

A hint of seriousness slips over the group Hygelac eyes
Beowulf

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 21

20 20
BEOWULF
Hrothgar would cross the water for
us

Looks shift about drifting generally back to Hygelac who
broods

HYGELAC
I know he would Ive had no
better neighbour-king Its just
that by the sounds of this thing

BEOWULF
--its never met a Geat

There is fierce pride in Beowulfs gaze and proud nods from
the others Hygelac looks at Beowulf torn

HYGELAC
I wont keep you home to frighten
fish And if you can
(indicates Hondscioh)
find Hondscioh a wife Our
sheep cant take much more

LAUGHS all round - mostly from Breca Hondscioh gamely
shrugs

21 EXT GEAT HARBOUR -- DAY 21

A LONGSHIP is being loaded Beowulf watching over the
process He glances across the dock and sees

-a row of human HEADS appearing to be sitting on a
board amongst them Hondscioh Breca and Thorkel One of
the heads moves starts speaking

Beowulf recoils a step then relaxes seeing the illusion

-the cluster of MEN standing by the boat their bodies
blocked by the dock

Beowulf strolls over to the group Hondscioh is holding a
harp in one hand holding off a reaching Thorkel with the
other

THORKEL
Give it

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 22
21

HONDSCIOH
What - you plan to sing the thing
to death

Breca snatches the harp from Hondscioh hands it to Thorkel
Hondscioh fires a dirty look at Breca who smirks

THORKEL
(to Beowulf re Hondscioh
warning)
He puts one hand on my harp

HONDSCIOH
Beowulf were gonna need some
extra shields
(off Beowulfs look re
Thorkel)
For our ears

THORKEL
(to Hondscioh)
---I warn you - youre a dead man

Hondscioh gives a mock-shudder Breca and Beowulf trade a
grin Thorkel does not placing his precious harp in a
rabbit-skin bag

And the loading continues
EXT OPEN WATER BEOWULFS LONGSHIP MOVING -- DUSK 22

Beowulf is slumped at the side of his LONGSHIP as it cuts
through the water TWELVE GEATS are with him including
Breca Hondscioh and Thorkel the sail doing all the work

One man is feeding the hearth fire on which meat is cooking

THORKEL
Say this thing makes meat of any
man it finds

BRECA
Danes say Danes who ran Ive
also known Danes wholl say they
fought off Attila when he wandered
North

HONDSCIOH

(wry)
Brecas right Danes cant even
swim after fish

BRECA
Walrus Hondscioh and next one I
catch its tusk goes up your arse

HONDSCIOH

Worse things

Laughter from the group
And they sail on

A glass-still channel of water in which dozens of ICEBERGS
stand seeming to exude a blue-white light

PUSH IN FIND a small boat - an Irish CORACLE - drifting

-in the aft of which a man in ragged monks cloak - BRENDAN
40s - is sprawled his ratty sail catching the bit of
breeze his hand draped over the rudder He appears weak and
sick his eyes those of a madman fixed with suspicion on the
looming ice figures

BRENDAN
(slurred Irish mutter)
woe betide you beasts of ice
ogre troll - I dont wary much

He raises one skinny arm like a weapon

BRENDAN (CONTD)
For I bring the burning sword of
Christ To cleave you thus and
thus and thus

And he strikes out his arm in the symbol of the cross
before his energy leaves him and his arm drops

BRENDAN
Fine then Hold your tongues
but dunna think I dunna know your
methods and your manner They say
you lie more below than above and
on a whim will swing your ice-blue
asses up at God Yesssss well do
as you must

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 24
23

He rises clutching the mast pointing accusingly at the
icebergs

BRENDAN (CONTD)
-but hear this vow I will melt
you and drink you down and piss you
out upon these shores and -yes -
you may freeze up and walk again
but only as a Christian thing

And he LAUGHS like a maniac then loses his balance falls
hits his head on the edge of the coracle - in the process
knocking himself out And the coracle drifts as before but
now in quiet peace

EXT DANISH SHORELINE BLACK BEACH -- DAY 24

CLOSE ON Brendans weather-beaten - and unconscious - face
complete with a scabbed-over gouge in his forehead

A stone hits his cheek he winces his eyes fluttering but
staying closed

Brendan mutters incomprehensibly twists sideways resuming
a fitful sleep

REVEAL SELMA 30 standing on a pebble beach several feet
from the run-aground coracle Though her battered and simple
clothes suggest poverty theres strength and intelligence
apparent in her Also wildness and a fierce beauty

She looks over Brendan and his simple possessions

She sees a small sack opens it and brings out a handful of
silver crosses on chains She considers them a moment is
putting them back when

UNFERTH
Selma

Selma turns to see
Unferth - on the shoreline ridge on HORSEBACK

UNFERTH (CONTD)
Yleave him as he lies

As Selma steps back from the coracle

-Unferth gallops down beside them

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204

SELMA
Whatever else Im no thief

UNFERTH
I didnt say ywere He might
carry sickness Ybring it to
land we all could die

Selma studies Unferth a beat with vague contempt

SELMA
By sickness eh Wouldnt that be
welcome
(off his look)
Already looking out for our people
Youre not king yet much as you
dream it

Unferth lets it go Looks over Brendans garments

UNFERTH
What sort of man

SELMA
Celt A priest

UNFERTH
How can you tell

SELMA
(sardonic)
By knowing Yever leave this
land you might know things too
(looks over Brendan)
Needs mostly water maybe fruit

UNFERTH
Fruit

Selma considers the water and her eyes faintly glaze

SELMA
But theres others coming a
boatload of spears

- 25

Unferth glances up and down the shore with evident concern

UNFERTH
Slavs No We killed those
yesterday

Selma shakes her head

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 26 24

SELMA
(eryptic)
These ones swim in blood
EXT ICEBERG PASSAGE -- DAY 25

WIDE ON the iceberg passage through which the longship
glides

There is no conversation now all the warriors moved instead
by the eerieness of the light

--some trying to draw warmth from the hearth fire
cS of Beowulfs hand dangling over the edge of the boat
ON his face as he closes his eyes
A small wave washes up across his arm

and from the water a creature-like HAND reaches up and
fiercely snatches hold of his wrist

Beowulf twists around rips his hand free
-only to find its been tangled in a rope from the ship

-but in the inky water below a play of light something
seeming to descend back down to the dark depths

Beowulf repositions his hand on the hilt of his sword
OMITTED 26
INT HROTHGARS CHAMBERS -- NIGHT 27

Hrothgar is creakily putting on his mailshirt Though only
months have passed since the trolls first attack these
months weigh on Hrothgar like many years Too much grief-
driven drink too many sleepless nights have brought him the
dull and watery gaze of a lost man

Wealhtheow his wife enters and looks troubled by Hrothgars
action

HROTHGAR
Who ever heard of a kingdom laid to
waste by a stinking troll
(off her look)
I cant game more men against this
thing

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 27

27 27
WEALHTHEOW
Then dont Its only in the
night
HROTHGAR
So then - Im king - but only by
day

Hrothgar sneers spits on the floor

HROTHGAR (CONTD)
Fuck that

Wealhtheow without missing a beat snatches up a shirt and
throws it to him Hrothgar catches it turns it in his hand

WEALHTHEOW
One troll outside is plenty

She nods to the spit clean it up

Hrothgar throws the shirt down on his spit rubs it with a
foot

HROTHGAR
Maybe it needs the blood of a king

Hrothgar takes up a cup of beer has a gulp then Wealhtheow
comes to him and gently takes the cup away He looks back at
her with mixed emotions

WEALHTHEOW
Dont let beer blur your wits

HROTHGAR
You called it he

WEALHTHEOW
Women seek a death for a loss
They get their blood-worth and
settle This has the blood-lust of
a man

HROTHGAR

Which I have to quell or Im
already dead

(off her look)
If Odin sent this thing to bring my
end so be it If not then
hell steer my sword

(beat)
My dear I miss the stars

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 28 27

Wealhtheow gently strokes his cheek Her eyes glaze with
tears but her hands move down and help tie the straps of his
battle-gear

Hrothgar meanwhile takes up his battle-mask helmet - and
stares into the hollow eye-sockets as if at a ghost

EXT DANISH VILLAGE PERIMETER-- NIGHT 28

Hrothgar moves out from the torch-lit rock perimeter a
massive two-handed sword turning in his adrenalined grip
His eyes fight the darkness and his fear

HROTHGAR
(shouts)
Troll I call you out

Nothing Hrothgar takes several steps further

HROTHGAR (CONTD)
Troll

A sudden rise of WIND and Hrothgar twists about - as though
Grendel had taken wind-form but the gust passes silence
resuming

WITH A GUARD on the boulders watching Hrothgar in the middle
distance facing out into the darkness

WITH Hrothgar staring out catching Grendels scent on the
air Hrothgars intensity returns eyes scanning the
periphery

HROTHGAR (CONTD)
(shouting)
Meet me in the light if you have
the guts Or fight me now You
hairy creep

The guard shakes his head at Hrothgars pathetic state

GRENDEL
(throaty mutter Troll
accent)
Creep creep

The guard swings about spear in hand his gaze rising up and
fixing in terror

--on Grendel several yards along the boulder from him also

watching Hrothgars performance Grendel grins shakes his
head

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 29
28

The guards mouth drops open but his voice utterly fails
him

Grendels grin shifts to grimace as an arm swings up
WITH Hrothgar as he takes one or two more hesitant strides
out into the darkness sniffing the air sensing something

his intensity returning

PEBBLES skid to one side of him Hrothgar wheels ready to
strike but another silence follows

A shadow crosses Hrothgar He wheels

-to meet a large shape descending through the air which
tumbles in a limp heap ending at Hrothgars feet the CORPSE
of the dead guard his neck neatly snapped

WITH Grendel watching with grim amusement from twenty feet
away one with the boulder he stands beside as

-Hrothgar charges forward into the darkness SCREAMING
swinging wildly and blindly with his sword

After several seconds of striking nothing he stops - catches
his breath - scanning around but nothing suggests any
shape

Finally there comes a CLICKING NOISE and then - almost a
LAUGH

WITH Hrothgar wheeling on the sound making out the massive
shape which he charges toward only to find on arrival
that the shape is the boulder

-and Grendel is nowhere to be seen

CLOSE ON Hrothgar staring helplessly out and then up to the
brilliant stars A sad smile comes and tears fill his eyes

EXT DANISH VILLAGE PERIMETER -- DAY 29

Wealhtheow urgently comes along the path passing VILLAGERS
who are subdued all looking toward

-Hrothgar who sits hunched over on a small rise facing
the wilds the dead guard lying beside him

Wealhtheow hurries up to Hrothgar looks him over with
concern

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 30
29

WEALHTHEOW
Are you wounded

HROTHGAR
The thing wouldnt fight It
spared me to witness this

A shudder rolls through him and he lets out a gasp eyeing
the corpse Another jerking shudder

Wealhtheow glances back sees the villagers watching and
whispering

WEALHTHEOW
(under her breath)
Then get up off your arse with
your thanes in sight This is no
ground for a king

HROTHGAR
(caustic dazed)
Oh youre wrong For a king
whos had his balls hauled up his
guts its the ground For all
the broken-bone wretches Ive flung
to death --

WEALHTHEOW
And Valhalla

Hrothgar considers the terror in the face of the dead guard

HROTHGAR
I dont know Is that the look of
a man going happily up to the
feast or down to the worms

WEALHTHEOW
You talk like a madman

HROTHGAR
No - just the Danish king of
daylight

WEALHTHEOW
Get up now or do we bury you
here

HROTHGAR
Is that your wish

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 31 29

Wealhtheow slaps him hard across the face - surprising
herself
HROTHGAR (CONTD)
(ironic)

With your thanes in sight

WEALHTHEOW
Whose wife would you have me be

Wealhtheow stares evenly at him He sighs shrugs
Wealhtheow turns and strides back up into the enclosure

EXT FIELD BEYOND THE DANISH VILLAGE -- DAY 30

Selma is picking berries The sound of a HORSE approaching
She turns to find

-Wealhtheow there Wealhtheow dismounts approaches
SELMA

(nodding to a spot)
Watch yourself

WEALHTHEOW
You think Ive lost feel for the
ground

SELMA

Theres brambles there bog
there Last thing I needs a dead
queen on my hands

WEALHTHEOW
Youve had worse and Ive been far
far less - dead or otherwise

Wealhtheow sits down on a rock while Selma keeps picking A
long silence

WEALHTHEOW (CONTD)
Selma should I fear for my
husband

SELMA
If youve got nothing better to do

WEALHTHEOW
Sweet dont play the bitch with
me I dont ask much and I dont
ask often No one dares dirty your
name around me

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 32
30

SELMA
(ironic)
Nor yours around me

They trade the hint of a smile
SELMA (CONTD)
(beat)
Hrothgar dies happy in his
sleep

WEALHTHEOW
Thats a lift

SELMA
Take them where we can eh

Wealhtheow smiles nods A silence

WEALHTHEOW
I could find a place for you
inside

SELMA

We chose our beds a long time back

The women share a look Wealhtheow nods Selma continues
with her berries

EXT DANISH VILLAGE -- DAY 31
A funeral pyre burns with the corpse of the guard

ON Hrothgar sitting on a rock a short distance off
polishing his sword with a cloth

BRENDAN
Thats one shiny sword

Hrothgar turns to find

-Brendan shuffling toward him Hes a bit of a sight in
his dark and ratty monks wool cassock hollowed eye sockets
and fierce - almost unblinking - gaze plus a wonky and
unpredictable gait

BRENDAN (CONTD)
Im told youre the Danes king
(off Hrothgars stare)
Northumbria wishes you well

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 33
31 31

HROTHGAR
Celt Youre a ways away

BRENDAN
I am but safe with the sword of
Christ Father Brendan

Brendan bows slightly his large crucifix swinging forward

HROTHGAR
I see aman I see a staff
(re the crucifix)
I see a weapon for killing toads
(off Brendans shrug)
Christ eh Ive heard of him He
ever have much luck with trolls

BRENDAN

Im under the thought they never
crossed paths

(off Hrothgars dismissive

look)
But if youre willing to bow before
Christ you shall feel the blessing
of his great strength

HROTHGAR
My gods dont ask me to bow

BRENDAN
Nor should they dare if they
wont protect you

This stings Hrothgar His hand squeezes the hilt of his
sword but he resists striking Brendan Brendan remains
unperturbed

He eyes the pyre as the guard is lifted upon it A guard
begins to blow on a horn - calling the villagers to the
burning

BRENDAN (CONTD)
To face Gods foes is an honour
Ive come to drive this evil out

HROTHGAR
With your stick

BRENDAN
With the fire of Heaven

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 34 31

HROTHGAR
If your heavens on fire ybetter
look to that

Brendan gets a furious look and starts to pace before
Hrothgar Hrothgar in spite of himself is a bit impressed
by Brendans intensity

BRENDAN
Leave me on a dish for the troll
then Leave me and if I dont see
mans dawn I shall see Gods I
shall see Gods

Brendan gazes fiercely at Hrothgar a moment his eyes blink
repeatedly then he collapses on the ground

Unferth strides up checks Brendan his breathing his eyes

UNFERTH
Hes asleep

All Hrothgar can manage is a sigh a shake of the head at the
grim farce his life has become

EXT DANISH SHORELINE BLACK BEACH -- DAY 32

Beowulfs longship edges into the shallows of a black
beach stone promontories rising high on either side

He and half his men jump down into the water and - guide-
ropes in hand - haul the boat up upon the stones

As the men in the boat begin passing over their battle-gear
to those in the water

they turn to the sound of a NEIGHING HORSE
and see ERIK a coast-guard come galloping down through a

break in the rock and pull up in the stones just out of
spear distance

ERIK

Hold there
BEOWULF

As you wish Is this land Dane
ERIK

It is and youre not So

unless youre ripe for a shower of
arrows youll tell who you are

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 35
32 32

Hondscioh gives a great amused laugh at Eriks threat Erik
unamused lifts from his hip a horn

ERIK (CONTD)
Two blows of this and fifty men
will be on these cliffs before
youve strapped your ring-shirts

HONDSCIOH
Fifty birds maybe

ERIK
(a threat)
Is that then your word

BEOWULF
Im Beowulf --

The name registers sharply with Erik

ERIK
Beowulf the Geat

BEOWULF
(nods)
We come as friends to Hrothgar

Erik looks over their equipment and over Beowulf - trying to
mask his awe

ERIK
We welcome friends Bring what you
need Ill have men look to your
ship

Erik blows ONCE on his HORN the powerful and eerie sound
echoing off the cliffs

HONDSCIOH
One blow is good news

ERIK
One blow is good

Hondscioh winks good-naturedly Erik glances at Beowulf who
shrugs

33 EXT OPEN GROUND -- DAY 33
Beowulfs troop loaded with their weaponry - shields

swords axes spears - walk across the even ground led by
Erik with his horse

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 36
33

Moss-ridden rock rises on either side boulders and irregular
ridges suggesting menacing shapes frozen for now

EXT DANISH VILLAGE -- DAY 34

As Erik and the Geats come up over a rise and into sight
of

-the Danish village Erik rides up ahead to

a GUARD at the break in the rocks who after a moment with
Erik waves them in

The Geats continue forward scanning

-VILLAGERS clustered around a couple funeral pyres The
villagers stare back - listless forlorn dead-eyed - at the
Geats

HONDSCIOH
(low to the other Geats)
By Thor theyve got the spark of
cows

BRECA
How bout that one

Beowulf and Hondscioh follow Brecas gaze

to Selma coming from the opposite direction carrying her
baskets Shes a jolt of vigor and beauty especially set
against the dregs through which she moves

Beowulf finds her studying him with interest he edges up to
Erik

BEOWULF
Whos the one with the baskets

ERIK
Selma A witch The happy would
keep a boat-length from her

HONDSCIOH
(lascivious)
Happiness isnt everything

ERIK
She sees peoples deaths

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 37
34

HONDSCIOH
(wry disappointment)
Wouldnt you know

And they continue on

EXT DANISH VILLAGE MEAD HALL -- MOMENTS LATER 35
The Geats come up to the great hall - a magnificent wood and
stone structure three stories high Below the eaves is hung
the great pair of bucks antlers and around these are ornate
wood carvings

The Geats are obviously impressed

BRECA
Thats one beer-hall eh Hondscioch

Before Hondscioh can respond

ERIK
If you like to drink with ghosts

As the Geats consider this a commotion rises behind them
They turn to see

a Cluster of men striding toward them the commotion
coming from the older man at the center who is GROWLING
impatience Unferth at his side muttering explanations

As they near Beowulf recognizes the old man as

Hrothgar who is half-drunk and just roused from sleep
Hrothgar seeing Beowulf strides clear of his own retinue

Beowulf struggles to mask his surprise at the kings wretched
appearance

HROTHGAR
By the gods My little Beowulf
(derisive nod to his
retinue)
No one tells me anything

He comes up to Beowulf and gives him a great hug then
holds him at a short distance looking him over grinning

HROTHGAR (CONTD)
I somehow think of you as smaller

BEOWULF
I was eight when I left

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 38
35 35

HROTHGAR
Youve grown

Smiles all around

BEOWULF
Im sorry We didnt mean to wake
you

HROTHGAR

Wake me Im a grief-crippled

king half-drunk in the middle of

the afternoon Whats to wake
(beat eyes welling)

By the gods its good to see you
(beat)

Perhaps Odin too has woken from his

slumber

WIDE ON the group Hrothgars guards to one side the
impressive band of Geats opposite all joining in SMILES

As Hrothgar leads them into the hall the Geats pass
-Brendan who stands to one side beatific smile on his
face apple in hand He locks gazes with Hondscioh as they
pass and blesses the group with the sign of the cross
Hondscioh forces an awkward smile nods continues past

36 EXT GRENDELS CAVE SHORELINE CLIFFS -- EVENING 36
CLOSE ON a humans dried-out HEAD on a cliff-edge facing
inland Several similar-size rocks sit in close proximity
The head is almost down to bone with some skin and a ratty

scalp of hair

Another rock rolls up toward the head but comes to rest
before it reaches it

Silence then another rock tumbles up toward the head gets
that much closer but stops as well

A snarling EXPLETIVE in Troll-tongue

GRENDEL
Yahhhg

REVEAL Grendel the rock-thrower as he takes his stance

once more MUTTERS reassurance to himself then heaves a
third rock toward the head

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 39
36

This rock crashes into the head knocking it over the cliff
GRENDEL (CONTD)
(high-pitched giddy yelp)
Heeeee

He struts about chest swelling then settles his gaze -
and sigh - on the sunset

EXT MEAD HALL -- EVENING 37
The mead hall glows with a profusion of TORCHES - both inside
and out - stunning against the twilight the great warm haven
it was meant to be

LAUGHTER and MUSIC from within

INT MEAD HALL -- CONTINUOUS 38

The benches are full of warriors and earls one side the Geat
troop on the other the Danes

On the Danes side there are considerably more women than
men the women talking between themselves flirtatiously
eyeing the revved-up Geats

ON Breca scanning several women his mouth falling open with
nerve-stunned lust Hondscioh beside him reaches over and
nudges his mouth closed

Between the two groups the fire-pits burn

LAUGHTER and talk compete with a MUSICIAN playing a HARP a
SECOND with a bone FLUTE a THIRD playing a BODHRAN

Hrothgar sits at one end of the room Beowulf nearest him

Theres abundant food and jugs of beer being delivered to the
warriors by teenaged ATTENDANTS

Wealhtheow passing behind Beowulf leans in to hin
indicates the numerous women

WEALHTHEOW
If a Geat were seeking a wife this
room would hold better hope than
most

BEOWULF
So many --

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 40
38

WEALHTHEOW
Widows
(off Beowulfs look)
Widows far too early

Beowulf nods glances across the group and his gaze meets

Unferth who is fixed on him with an ugly look Unferth
takes a long draught from his drink clearly well on the way
to drunk

Wealhtheow reluctantly pours beer from a jug into the drunk
Hrothgars cup With some effort he stands

AESCHERE
Ho

And the room goes silent

Hrothgar looks about eyes watering He smiles but as
quickly gets overwhelmed with emotion Catches a huge
breath The grief and fear and hopelessness wash over his
face He clears his throat but nothing follows

He scans the group shrugs apologetically LAUGHS - but its
nothing the others can join in on

Wealhtheow gently puts a hand on his shoulder whispers
something in his ear He nods and lowers himself back to his
seat

Wealhtheow turns to the assembly

WEALHTHEOW

With my king I welcome you all
Too many days weve drunk to forget
the night and what it brings But
today we drink to what the days
brought - thirteen swords against
our curse Thirteen men to swell
our weary

(soft suggestive)
-walls

Wealhtheow turns to Beowulf and fills his cup

WEALHTHEOW (CONTD)
Well never forget this gift

And she moves along the row of Geats pouring into each cup

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 41 38

Beowulf rises and he too finds himself a bit emotional His
gaze drifts over the group as he speaks

BEOWULF

Ill say this once this is no
gift coming here is the least I
can do Danes you sheltered me as
a child Some of you here are old
enough to remember To the rest I
say only I come as a brother

(beat)
These others with me made their own
minds We mean to bring an end to
this fiend --

UNFERTH
(loud mutter)
As others vowed

WEALHTHEOW
Unferth

BEOWULF
By your will dear queen were
wiser in knowing the hearts of
those whove tangled with the
thing

A brief silence through which Unferth and Beowulf lock gazes

AESCHERE
(sharp eyeing Unferth)
Those are dead

UNFERTH

I dont brag of wrestling with it
nor of being able to kill it

(beat)
The troll broke down these doors
with twenty Danish warriors
sleeping inside What gives
thirteen Geats better hope

HONDSCIOH
We wont be sleeping

UNFERTH
No - more likely bragging of your
fights with cod-fish

A coldness sweeps through the room the Geats on edge
Aeschere rises livid glaring at Unferth

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 42 38

AESCHERE
If you dont know what this man has
done youll shut your hole or have
it shut for you If you do know
then so much the worse

Hrothgar glances over blinking up out of his fog

BEOWULF
(to Unferth)
So friend - unscathed amidst all
this death - should we guess youve
steered your way clear of bragging

Unferth gets a wild look rises from his seat hand to his
sword-hilt But just as suddenly Hrothgar has risen this
time with fury

HROTHGAR
Unferth Sit or see your guts ina
dish

Unferth looks suddenly puzzled the beer fogging his head
Finally he sits

Hrothgar eyes the Geats struggling for focus

HROTHGAR (CONTD)

Forgive us forgetting the ways of
kin Beowulf if you do as you
vow theres nothing you can wish
for that wont be yours - if I have
any weight in it

(beat)
Now before the dark must sharpen
us again songs and beer

As an attendant reaches to pour into Hrothgars cup he
covers it with his hand shakes his head

The musicians begin again and the attendants bring more
beer conversations rising up all around

EXT FIELD BEYOND THE DANISH VILLAGE -- EVENING 39

The far-off sound of LAUGHTER from the hall drifts over the
field

And a dark silhouette rises in the foreground Grendel

slowing at the sound He listens with puzzlement - which
shifts to irritation

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 43
39

He shakes his head categorically

GRENDEL
(firm mutter)
Na-na-na-na na-na-na-na

--and he lopes off toward the distant lights his stride
lengthening arms swinging landscape streaming under his
feet

EXT MEAD HALL BALCONY -- EVENING 40

As the Geat warriors below and inside set up their equipment
preparing for an attack - with a drunken Unferth watching
them suspiciously

-Beowulf and Hrothgar stand on the open balcony looking
out on the falling dark Hrothgars mood is grim in spite
of the RAUCOUS men below but hes more clear-headed

HROTHGAR
Since it began weve had Saxons
Swedes even Slavs coming to
see how weak we were

Beowulf studies Hrothgar a long beat

HROTHGAR (CONTD)
I know I look like walrus shit
Comes of fighting things you cant

Hrothgar manages a weak smile Beowulf clasps Hrothgars
shoulder

BEOWULF
All bad dreams end Well see you
in the morning for herring and egg

HROTHGAR
Herring and egg

As Beowulf turns toward the battlement a desperate look
crosses Hrothgars face struggling with the things he cant
say

BEOWULF
If theres anything you need to
tell me about it now would be
the time

Hrothgar fights a shudder Beowulf again takes hold of his
shoulder steadies him Hrothgar clenches Beowulfs hand

40A

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 44
40

HROTHGAR
Ill stay here amongst you
Beowulf shakes his head
BEOWULF
Well bring you the head Throw it

in with the herring and egg

They trade smiles Hrothgar studies Beowulf sees his steely
resolve For the first time in ages Hrothgar risks hope

INT MEAD HALL -- NIGHT 40A
PAN OVER the thirteen Geats some lying on mats on the
floor some on benches one or two slumped back in sitting
position against the walls all with weapons at the ready
All alert and waiting

all except Unferth who lies back snoring loudly

Beowulf sits at the foot of the empty throne staring into
the embers of the fire-pit his great sword in his hand

EXT DANISH VILLAGE MEAD HALL -- NIGHT 41
Brendan is kneeling at the bottom of a slope leading up to
the mead hall He is facing the wilds and quietly PRAYING
in LATIN

The huge shape of Grendel edges into the light headed on a
line from the rocks - through Brendan - to the hall

Brendan sniffing the air visibly tenses but continues in
prayer eyes closed

Grendel - still yards away - slows to a stop and takes his
own long sniff of Brendan Clearly it puzzles him a man-
smell hes not met before

As Brendans prayer increases in breathiness

Grendel curves off and around him then onward up to the
hall

INT MEAD HALL -- CONTINUOUS 42

An ember POPS and its followed immediately by the CREAK
of straining timber

Beowulfs gaze swings to the doors

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 45

EXT MEAD HALL -- CONTINUOUS 43

Grendel leans toward the doors sniffing - and even more
puzzled by the smells from inside

INT MEAD HALL -- CONTINUOUS 44
From outside the sound of Grendels SNIFFING

The warriors swing up from their beds adrenaline of battle
rushing in - but theyre cautious to not betray their

readiness - all eyes are open all mouths closed

Some men remain squatting others stand weapons drawn in
preparation

EXT MEAD HALL -- CONTINUOUS 45

CLOSE ON Grendel holding his forearm horizontally against
the door seeming to test its strength

Grendels head then slumps forward forehead resting against
the arm Grendel closes his eyes

INT MEAD HALL -- CONTINUOUS 46

There then comes a longer CREAK and a gentle - yet enormous -
pressure on the bolted doors from outside a great SIGH

Beowulf sword at the ready edges to the door Hondscioh
and Breca at his side

Theres a silence the warriors apprehension building
-then a prolonged TRICKLE sound

Beowulf looks down and immediately jerks back a step
avoiding

CLOSE ON a liquid - Grendels urine - pooling under the
door

Beowulf gives his men a look they all move forward as
Beowulf angrily throws off the locking timber and swings
open the door swings back his blade

-to find only darkness and the staggering stench of the
trolls piss-mark

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 46

EXT MEAD HALL -- NIGHT 47

ON Brendan eyes closed still praying as a huge SHADOW -
thrown by the mead hall torches - passes over him

a THROATY SNICKER from the passerby and then he is gone
Brendan lets out a sigh but does not open his eyes
EXT DANISH VILLAGE MEAD HALL -- DAY 48

ON BLACKSMITHS turning glowing pokers against the stained
wood of the great doors burning off Grendels urine

Beowulf Hondscioh and Hrothgar amongst others watch from
one side Hrothgar is puzzled but relieved

HROTHGAR
Worse things than a bloodless dawn

BEOWULF
He let us rest the worse for
him

HONDSCIOH
He ever leave men alive in the
hall

HROTHGAR

Since it began
Hrothgar shakes his head
The three men trade a look Beowulfs drifting gaze finds
Brendan a short distance off sitting on a rock - almost
indiscernible among the boulders surrounding him Hes

chewing on an apple studying the others

Beowulf strides down to him Hondscioh and Hrothgar
following

BEOWULF
Priest where did you spend the
night

Brendan considers him a moment then nods to the spot where
hed been praying

BEOWULF (CONTD)

You didnt move at all through the
night

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 47
48

BRENDAN
(considers shrugs)
Up once to piss but

Beowulf gives a dubious look

BRENDAN (CONTD)

(wry rhetorical)
Why was such a daft wretch spared

(beat fervent)
Demons wise enough to know a
messenger of God To touch my
cloaks to bring Gods very fire
and storm upon its head

HONDSCIOH
Thats not what he asked

Brendan stares back at Hondscioh a beat then - ignoring him -
turns to Hrothgar

BRENDAN
Wise king you must know the name
of Clovis

HONDSCIOH
The Frank

BRENDAN
(faintly condescending)
The Frank yes Yes the Frank
(beat intense)
The Christian sword over land ten
times what the Danes hold dear

BEOWULF
Hes dead
BRENDAN
Did I say he was a god
(beat)

Hes dead yes ten years now --
but not before he saw Gods grace
the Visigoths of Aquitaine the
Romans under Syagrius Burgundians
Alamans all fell before him And
all because he had Gods ear

Beowulf

and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204

HROTHGAR
If I recall he also had a thousand
swords neighbours gone soft on
wine and pig no ice on his rivers -

HONDSCIOH
And no fucking trolls

HROTHGAR
And no trolls

BRENDAN
My skinny hand can only bless But
trust me - this thing shall meet
its end in striking me or those
of mine

Brendan shuffles off The three share a look

BEOWULF
Madness has its wonders

UNFERTH
(throaty)
The Celt sat straight in the path
of the thing and was not
touched

- 48

The three turn to see a haggard hungover Unferth approach

HONDSCIOH
(mutter)
The dead do walk

BEOWULF
(to Hrothgar)
The Celt held no sword Perhaps
the thing hates weapons

HROTHGAR
But your men were armed

Hondscioh fixes on Unferth and his sword

HONDSCIOH
Others here in arms have been
spared

Unferth gives him a threatening look

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 49
48 48

UNFERTH
Ive waited for Odin to bring me my
death He hasnt

HONDSCIOH

(wry)
In his wisdom

Unferth trembles with indignation sensing insult but
theres little to take hold of He turns and strides away

HROTHGAR
There walks one of my toughest
fighters He still is with men
but the troll stole his spine

Beowulf broods a beat

BEOWULF
Do you know where the thing makes
its home

HROTHGAR

We followed a blood-trail once
took us to the foot of cliffs

49 EXT FLOODPLAIN LEADING TO CLIFFS -- DAY 49
With the steammist burning off the water

Erik leads Beowulf and the Geats - on horseback - down
the black sand beach DOGS running ahead

to a wall of daunting cliff at the bottom of which the
dogs sniff and howl

Beowulf Hondscioh and Breca consider the challenging climb

ERIK
This is where the blood trails led
HONDSCIOH
Not much known to daylight climbs
up that
BEOWULF

Which is why he gets his rest

Beowulf starts up through the rocks

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 50
49

HONDSCIOH
I tell you this troll must be one
tough prick
(off Brecas look wry)
Do this climb every night after
supper

And the others proceed to follow Beowulf
EXT CLIFFS -- LATER 50
The Geat troop is edging up the rocky bluff but warily the
warriors struggling to gauge the shadows which shift with the
shifting mist
THORFINN 20s wiry and vigorous leads the way now
--with Beowulf and Hondscioh just a bit back of him
Hondscioh eyes Erik
HONDSCIOH
You want to blow your horn now I
wouldnt mind those fifty bows you
bragged of
ERIK
I could bring the bows But the

men are gone

Beowulf gives Hondscioh a look but his gaze then fixes
on

Thorfinn who stepping up takes hold of a jutting hunk of
driftwood for support

BEOWULF
This is too high up for driftwood
(warning)
Thorfinn
As Thorfinn stops and turns Beowulf urgently scans around
There comes the SOUND of shifting rock just above Thorfinn

The piece of wood comes free in his hand he loses his
footing and tumbles back

From a ridge just above him there swings down a great rack of
curved white spikes

Thorfinn scrambles to the side just missing impalement

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 51
50

-before the rack lodges in the rocks on either side

Beowulf and Hondscioh - swords drawn - edge up to the
whalebone barrier

They scan through the steadily increasing FOG
HONDSCIOH
(wry)

Little high up for a whales ribs

They each take hold of a side of the contraption but it does
not budge

BEOWULF
This is sharpened bone

HONDSCIOH
---and rigged to swing
(to Erik)

What are we fighting here

ERIK
A thing beyond our ken

OMITTED 51
EXT ROCKY PASSAGE -- DAY 52
The Geats stride along a cleft between a sea of glacial
boulders They are moving quickly - though warily - but

there is more ferocity than fear in their eyes

The rocky outcrops suggest figures looming between the moss
and mist and stone

OMITTED 53
OMITTED 54
EXT BOULDERS GLACIER -- MOMENTS LATER 55

ON brawny hands seeking grip in the top of a boulder They
do - and with a GRUNT of effort

-Beowulf pulls himself up into view
His expression - that of the hunter on the scent of prey -
loses its fierceness shifting abruptly to that of a man lost

at sea

As Hondscioh and Breca come up on either side of him

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 52
55

the three gaze out over
-a massive glacial plain rising up for several miles

BEOWULF
Were out of our world

The three consider the magnificent - if eerie - rippled ice
on either side of which rise only boulders

EXT RIDGE WATERFALL -- DAY 56
ON GRIMUR a misfit Dane standing in the river down from

the waterfall being baptized by Brendan HOWLING out
indecipherable Latin

ON Hrothgar sitting on a rock overlooking a waterfall and
facing down to the pool below the falls his eyes watery
face wet Some yards back of him stands his HORSE

The Geat troop appear on the ridge Beowulf at the head
Beowulf nears and

--Hrothgar - startled by the approach - wheels about sword
in hand Orients himself Wipes the misttears from his

face Forces an awkward smile

HROTHGAR
I was off in a dream

BEOWULF
Wish I could bring a better one

Hrothgar scans their ranks sees all intact

BEOWULF (CONTD)
This things smart as a man

HROTHGAR
Were it less itd hang on my wall

BEOWULF
Have you ever tried to trap it

HROTHGAR
Ten men waited one night Ready
With nets swords spears It went
through them like salmon

BEOWULF
Yet it didnt try us

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 53

HROTHGAR
(weary smile)
Perhaps you smell off

Beowulfs gaze drifts to the water below the falls

ANGLE DOWN ON curious VILLAGERS scattered along the

riverbank also watching

-Brendan in his cloak standing with Unferth now who is
naked to the waist in the middle of the swirling stream

Brendan SCREAMING his LATIN against the roar of the falls
takes up a handful of water and splashes Unferth in the sign

of the cross
Hrothgar and Beowulf consider the ritual

HROTHGAR (CONTD)
Baptism they call it Unferth

feels hes fallen from the gaze of

eur gods

BEOWULF

Did Unferths king give him this

freedom
(off Hrothgars shrug)

You dont fear he has an eye on

your throne

HROTHGAR

I know he does My sons are dead

BEOWULF
From the troll

HROTHGAR
(shakes his head)

One to fever one to Wulfings one

to an iceberg turning
(beat)

To sit in blood isnt every mans
wish If this Christ can stiffen
Unferths heart whats the harm

As Unferth wades back toward the shore
Beowulf sees Hrothgars despondency

BEOWULF
They swim only out of fear

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204

HROTHGAR

Still they swim

The two consider the dilemma
EXT FIELD BEYOND THE DANISH VILLAGE -- DAY
Selma is alone in the field picking herbs

BEOWULF
Dusk soon eh

Selma turns sees Beowulf some yards off She fights
intrigue

SELMA

Beowulf momentarily thrown struggles up a grin

SELMA
Ch I am But my parents were
killed by Wulfing raiders

BEOWULF
(bright)
My father too
(corrects himself)
--not killed I mean but a feud
with the Wulfings brought us here

SELMA
(flat)
It happens I guess you werent
made a whore

A silence He gets her point Selma continues with picking

plants
BEOWULF
Im told you know of things to
come
SELMA

Thats a wide sea

BEOWULF
of the deaths of things

SELMA
Seeing that everything living dies
you still give me the sight of

Not of yourself

BEOWULF
In some things Id rather be blind

(off his look)

I say he dies you likely live I
say he lives

She throws him a look A silence She relents

SELMA
By Grid youre the lamest blood-
mighty Ive met
(off his look beat)
The death of the troll will cost
dear both the Geats and Danes as
it bloody well should

BEOWULF
Why as it should

SELMA
The Danes have done their doom on
him And you come here to kill

BEOWULF
We game our lives coming here To
help the Danes You said youre
Dane

SELMA
Im not a killer

Beowulf grabs hold of her arm his anger rising But she
stares back at him gives no physical resistance only her
eye

BEOWULF
(a warning)
Many men wouldnt hold themselves

SELMA
Oh so youre a soft-heart too

Beowulf catches himself releases her arm and steps back
SELMA
Some men end up torn to bits And
eaten Their heads used for
bowling

Beowulf scowls thrown by the weirdness of her warning

BEOWULF
Bowling

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 57
57 57

SELMA
Rolling a ball against standing
cups or - I dunno - skulls The
Saxons play it But youre just a
worm-eaten northern shit so I
guess you wouldnt know

Beowulf stares hard at her but her gaze is more than a
match

Theyre interrupted by Hondscioh and Breca riding up on
horseback Beowulf breaks eye contact with Selma glances at
Hondscioh

HONDSCIOH
The days going down If we want
to be ready

Beowulf nods and starts back toward the village

SELMA
Careful with what you dont
understand

Beowulf turns eyes her a beat then continues on with his
boys

Once out of Selmas earshot Hondscioh catches Brecas eye
grins

HONDSCIOH
Thats one spooky Danish girl

BEOWULF
Yever heard of bowling
(off their looks)
Something the Saxons do

BRECA
Wouldnt trust a Saxon as far as I
could throw him

HONDSCIOH
Yever met a Saxon

BRECA
Knew someone who did

Hondscioh gives a SNORT of doubt And the men continue on

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 58

EXT DANISH VILLAGE -- DUSK 58
Beowulf Hondscioh and Breca walk back through the village

and find the villagers in an improved mood There are
CONVERSATIONS in the pathways mild LAUGHTER

They pass the blacksmiths forge

The SMITH grins waves a red-hot axe-head held in tongs He
gives a forearmfist of solidarity and rams the axe-head
down into the water bucket - bursting STEAM

The three Geats continue on
-coming upon

-Grimur who is whimpering cornered into a section of the
barricade holding up his arms to protect his bleeding head
from stones thrown by a cluster of KIDS

HONDSCIOH
Ho

The kids wheel stones in hand Seeing who it is they have
a quick MUTTERING conference but back off a bit One kid
steps up

KID
Grimurs got a troll-heart He
brought Grannel here

BEOWULF
Grannel

KID
The troll

GRIMUR

(through bloody mouth)
Im a Dane and a Christian

KID
Your mother screwed trolls

GRIMUR
You little prick

Wild-eyed Grimur staggers at the kid who drills him in the
head with a stone

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 59
58 58

Grimur screeches falls to the ground groaning and holding
his head

As the kid moves to give Grimur a kick Beowulf steps between
them He eyes the kids harshly but the kid is as wild-
eyed as Grimur

KID
(tremulous )
Grannel killed my brothers

And Beowulf sees the rage in the child He places his huge
hand on the kids trembling shoulder Indicates Grimur

BEOWULF
This wretch didnt But well get
the one that did

The kid meets Beowulfs eye He calms turns leads his
group away

59 EXT MEAD HALL BALCONY -- DUSK 59

As the Geat warriors prepare their troll-watch in the hall
below

-Beowulf approaches Hrothgar on the balcony

BEOWULF
I didnt know this thing had a
name
(off Hrothgars look)
Even the children know him -
Grannel

Hrothgar gives a disinterested shrug
BEOWULF
Has this thing - this Grannel -
killed any children

Hrothgar thinks a moment shakes his head

BEOWULF
Women
(off Hrothgars headshake)
Old men or men without war-gear
HROTHGAR

What - youre thinking he fights
with a clean heart

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 60

BEOWULF
I just --
HROTHGAR
(flaring)

He kills the strongest first He
shows us he can kill the strongest
And who cares if he spares the
children - theyll die anyhow
without their fathers

A silence

BEOWULF
My wits still war with how this all
began

HROTHGAR
(shrugs)
Hate for the hall I can only
guess The night we finished
building it the foul creep came
We hadnt seen a troll in
fifteen maybe twenty years

BEOWULF
So nothing was done to this troll
itself

HROTHGAR

(faintly irked)
Beowulf Its a fucking troll
Maybe someone looked at it the
wrong way

BEOWULF
(beat soft)
Some Dane

Hrothgar studies Beowulf with faint suspicion

HROTHGAR
Who hands you this Selma
(off Beowulfs look)
Shes been alone in the wilds too
long Her heads full of spiders
laps full of moss

BEOWULF
Its said she sees things

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 61 59

HROTHGAR
The crazy do
(beat)
Listen I never begged anyone to
come here and take on our fight I
dont hold you here --

BEOWULF
We came to help

HROTHGAR
Then I beg you dont saddle my
heart with talk of why a troll does
what it does

Hrothgar eyes the dimming horizon Turns squeezes Beowulfs
shoulder and starts down the steps back into the hall

Beowulf scans the ground the darkness creeping from the
rocks but his heart remains unsettled

INT MEAD HALL -- NIGHT 60

then another TAPCLATTER - this one from the other side
As the men spread themselves about the space

there comes a FLURRY of things HITTING and BOUNCING off
the ROOF

Beowulf takes up a torch indicates for Hondscioh to open the
door

As Beowulf cocks back his torch-hand ready to throw it
Hondscioh and Breca throw open the doors
to find nothing there but the dark
The band led by Beowulf nonetheless charges forward

Hondscioh edges up beside Breca

rest of his crew He stares into the dark

With FOG hanging over the village

Beowulf wanders along brooding on the peacefulness of the
morning

-Danes seeming to be going about their business

He comes up to a firepit where Thorkel - harp in hand - is
facing a small group of fascinated CHILDREN

THORKEL
Oer the night the warriors
waited Sword and shield in ring-
wrapped grip Then the fiend of
bog and brine Crept to those
doors of ten mens weight Bade
it creak with breath alone But
then smelt God amongst the men
Hardly had they hoisted steel
Than the things rank guts gave

Beowulf crosses the hall toward him

-Hrothgar breaking from his stupor

HROTHGAR
I built this hall to be my home
Not the stinking grave of my
people Maybe it should just burn
down

A silence Beowulf considers the handsome hall

BEOWULF
I dont know what else we can do
He comes here throws his stones
pisses goes If I knew what
steers his mind --

EXT EDGE OF VILLAGE -- DAY 69B
Beowulf walks along the edge of the village looking over
some Geats making adjustments to their weapons
one mending his jerkin
»another whittling a fish from wood
He passes an old shed only to find

-Thorkel on the other side having sex with a young Danish
WIDOW

Beowulf watches a moment more than he otherwise might
briefly transfixed before Thorfinn turns and sees him

Beowulf turns away

-continues on over to a field

»-where Breca and Hondscioh are practicing sword-play

But the two of them are in very different worlds Breca is
fighting with spectacularly flashy great swings of his great
blade whereas Hondscioh seems lost in thought - matter-of-
factly blocking Brecas strokes but making no advances on
his own

Breca stops indicates Hondscioh to Beowulf

BRECA
Hes already fighting like a Dane

Hondscioh had a bad dream

Beowulf glances at Hondscioh giving this more respect than
Breca is willing to Hondscioh shakes his head dismissive

BEOWULF
(to Breca)
And yours were good

A trading of swordstrokes Breca shrugs

BEOWULF (CONTD)
Here with the smoke of the dead

Breca gets the shot Takes a heavy swing at Beowulf which
Beowulf blocks

BRECA
I dont see fear helping us

HONDSCIOH
Dont you fucking start --

BEOWULF
Fear eh

And Beowulf takes a couple fierce swings at Breca under
which Breca staggers back

The two stare at each other a beat - fire in their eyes
And Breca strides forward swinging his blade as to cut
through trees Beowulf - seeing the power - keeps back till

Breca has spent some of his emotion

Then Beowulf counters knocking Breca back till he tumbles
over some uneven ground

Beowulf stands over him his blade raised

BRECA
Careful you dont drop it

with suspicion

EXT SELMAS HUT -- EARLY EVENING 71
Selma is cooking at her fire-pit

Beowulf rides up surprising her but she quickly masks it

SELMA

How did you find me
BEOWULF

Most Danes seem to know the way
SELMA

Most dont have the guts these

days

She studies his face sees a wildness in his eye resigns
herself

She puts down the utensils turns her back to him spreads
her legs slightly hikes up her skirt and bends over against
a railing offering herself

Beowulf struggles with his urge
SELMA (CONTD)
Theres butter in the bowl if you
need it

Beowulf averts his eyes

BEOWULF
I wondered if you threw the stones

Selma straightens up drops her skirt

SELMA

Then the gods will bring me back

Its both a warning and a promise
SELMA
So No thoughts at all for my

now

Selma sits on the floor leaning over the rune-stones as she
shakes them throws them and then considers

Beowulf sits opposite transfixed by what the V in her
neckline reveals of her chest

Beowulf watches a moment - in obvious awe - then rushes to
his horse and mounts it But in turning to mount the
horse he finds

-the figure already lost from view

Nonetheless he edges off in pursuit

EXT WILDS ROCKFACE -- CONTINUOUS 74
Beowulf rides along though cautiously due to the mist
Shapes can be vaguely made out suggestions of movement
but theyre unresolved indefinite - keeping Beowulf on his

guard

There comes a weird unsettling LAUGH then the sound of
FALLING SCREE to one side

-and Beowulf veers off the trail

coming to a slope which leads up to a more sheer rock-
face At his feet dust from the stone-fall is only starting
to settle

Selma rides up beside him Beowulf gives her a wary look

BEOWULF
Was this in the rune-stones

Selma shakes her head - but in exasperation not
confirmation

Beowulf dismounts and starts up the scree-ridden slope

SELMA
Thats less than wise

BEOWULF
(hint of suspicion)
So your stones say

SELMA
They dont need to Most could
see to climb shifting scree at
dusk in mist unless of course
youre a hero

You can leave or meet your doom
(beat)
Youre not Dane Thats why you
still breathe

WITH Grendel

BEOWULF
Im blood-bound to Hrothgar

GRENDEL
(to himself mocking)
-blood blood blood

Grendel gathers up some stones from between his feet He

GROWLS out a terse phrase to Beowulf

WITH Beowulf looking to Selma for translation

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 71 74

SELMA
Says thats your burden

Beowulfs temper frays he raises his sword at the rock-face

BEOWULF
My burden is your stinking life

A silence then the handful of stones come down upon
Beowulfs helmet infuriating him more

BEOWULF
Come down here I swear Ill hammer
these stones right up your hairy
arse

A long MUTTER and Selma tries her hardest not to laugh
Beowulf stares at her impatient for the translation

SELMA
He says that might help Hes had
a hard time shitting since the last
Dane he ate

The sound of shifting scree and Beowulf raises his
sword eyeing the mist for a discernible shape But
nothing comes A silence

SELMA
Hes gone

BEOWULF
Why wont he fight me

SELMA

Why should he Youve done nothing

to him
Selma turns her horse and starts back down the path Beowulf
looks - from her - back up into the darkening rock-face
perplexed
EXT SELMAS HUT -- EVENING 75
Beowulf rides into the camp to find

--Selma stirring up the embers of her firepit

Beowulf dismounts edges over to her

BEOWULF
What was he doing at your hut

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 72
75 75

Selma gives a faintly contemptuous look but its met by
Beowulfs own look - one carrying a scary volatility

SELMA
I forgot Youre the great Geat -
welcome to women wherever you go
Swimmer of oceans able to kill
five Swedes in a stroke of his
great blade

BEOWULF
I only came to help the Danes find
peace

SELMA

Im Dane Im at peace Not that
I always was

(beat)
When Alvis Three-Legs died in my
bed some - like Unferth - claimed
I killed him with a drink They
burned my hut drove me to the
wilds Then theyd only come
around to maybe spill some seed

BEOWULF
Unferth too

SELMA
Unferth leading

BEOWULF
They still come

SELMA
Not since Grendel

BEOWULF
Grendel What sort of name --

SELMA
Means grinder

BEOWULF
of bones

SELMA
Of teeth He was born with bad
dreams

Beowulf gives a skeptical look Selma shrugs believe it or
not

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 73 75

SELMA (CONTD)
Nothing I say will help you kill
him

Beowulf studies her - sees the challenge - and her witchy
beauty in the falling light

SELMA (CONTD)

Keep to the path Try not to fight

with the moss
Selma crosses the threshold into the hut lights a lamp then
takes off her cloak She turns in the doorway and her
breasts shift noticeably beneath the worn-thin cloth of her
blouse She stares back at Beowulf a beat then closes the
door
The sound of a WOODEN LATCH falling into place

Beowulf both stunned and aroused turns and mounts his
horse eyes the falling dark

EXT PATH APPROACHING VILLAGE -- EVENING 76
Beowulf rides along warily

-while above in the boulders Grendel scrambles smiling
keeping pace

INT MEAD HALL -- NIGHT 77

ON Beowulf sitting before the fire-pit staring into the

Around him all the Geat warriors sleep For the first time
seeming peace

Beowulfs gaze is fixed on the great doors on which shadows
gently shift suggesting figures ghosts

With sunlight streaming in through the smoke-hole

-Hrothgar leans forward against the wall pissing into a
bucket

He winces eyes closed sweat on his forehead Finished he
looks down and - as quickly - jerks his gaze away

HROTHGAR
(tremulous whisper)
Fuck me

He takes up the bucket starts out of the room when

-Wealhtheow comes in with a pitcher and cups She
immediately sees his state She looks to the bucket but he
pushes past her Panic rises in her

WEALHTHEOW
Hrothgar

HROTHGAR
Its age Nothing more

WEALHTHEOW
Stay

Hrothgar puts the bucket out of the room turns back to her

WEALHTHEOW
(persuading herself)
You dont go in pain You go in
peace Happy

HROTHGAR

Happy

(forced laugh)
Well then Im not going
anywhere today

(beat)
Who says this Selma

(off Wealhtheows silence)
Odin wishes me no peace

(long beat)
She said I die happy

Wealhtheow nods Hrothgar shakes his head trying to fathom
the thought

80 EXT DANISH VILLAGE -- DAY 80

CLOSE ON a hnaftafl board Norse chess-like game with Breca

dozen light players surrounded by a besieging force of twenty
dark players a light king-figure in the center of the board

WIDEREVEAL Beowulf and a few Geats standing nearby
watching

HROTHGAR
So long as the king wins the day

The Geats turn to see Hrothgar shuffle up with an amiable
grin

HONDSCIOH
Always my Lord

Hrothgar pats Beowulfs shoulder leads him away from the
others

HROTHGAR
So another bloodless night
(off Beowulfs nod)
Well for you at any rate

Beowulf ponders the cryptic comment Hrothgar makes sure
none of the others are close enough to hear

HROTHGAR
Im pissing it

BEOWULF
(after a puzzled beat)
Blood

HROTHGAR
(nodsshrugs)
Its come and gone over the months
(forced grin)
Im turning to a woman Or a dying
man

Beowulf gathers his words

BEOWULF
Last night I talked with him

Hrothgar looks at him not getting the sense

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 76

BEOWULF (CONTD)
Grendel

HROTHGAR
(stunned)
You talked

BEOWULF
If you can trust what Selma says

Hrothgar considers this a long beat

BEOWULF (CONTD)
He stayed above me in the rocks
But it was a voice speaking
words He only wants Danes He
blames you for something

Hrothgar almost chokes on this

HROTHGAR
He blames me Of all the shit
(fierce mutter)
What the fuck they think --

Hrothgar stops himself A silence

HROTHGAR (CONTD)

There are coves north of here no
Dane even dares to go How much
land does one mouth need Whats
he think - hes a fucking troll
Caesar - with rights to everything
he looks upon

(indicating the mountains)
We roamed the seas I will say
that But up there that rock and
ice we never found the need to go
I didnt go knocking down his door

The two men brood on this a beat Hrothgar sighs to
calmness

HROTHGAR (CONTD)
Word on the waves is I die happy
(off Beowulfs look)
No gods I know have offered me
that No Mine just offer beer a
fish here and there and friends
to burn

knows more

WIDEREVEAL Brendan raising a handful of water and touching
Hrothgars in the sign of the cross MUTTERING LATIN as he

As Brendan turns back to the shore
Hrothgar remains and turns to the deeper water
HROTHGAR
(a mutter)
Bless me or be done and drown
me in blood

WIDE ON many DANES on the shore watching the ritual

CLOSE ON Beowulf and Hondscioh watching with clearly mixed
emotions

HONDSCIOH
Great Now we get a pissed-off
Odin

BEOWULF

Or maybe no one up there at all

Grimur approaches healed but still showing the scabs

from his wounds and edges up to Beowulf
GRIMUR
I owe you for sparing me from those
stones I can lead you to the Dane-
killers cave
Beowulf is stunned by the offer
BEOWULF
Grendel
(off his nod wary)
Why didnt you before
GRIMUR
I feared all things its wrath
my death

He holds up a cross on a chain around his neck

GRIMUR (CONTD)
No more

Grimur gives a happy smile Beowulf masks his ambivalence
EXT ISOLATED SHORELINE BEOWULFS LONGSHIP MOVING -- DAY 83

Beowulfs ship moves along the shore Grimur scanning the
rocks

As Beowulf looks out over the open water

GRIMUR
There

Beowulf turns to see

-Grimur pointing to a break in the rocks The helmsman
leans against the rudder and the boat turns toward it

EXT GRENDELS CAVE -- DAY 84
Grimur leads the crew up over treacherous rocks towards

«-an entrance in the cliffside They light up torches go
in

INT GRENDELS CAVE -- CONTINUOUS 85

As they edge into the darkness

their torches flicker and HISS in the oozy damp
Hondscioh takes several steps forward
and the ground goes out below him As Hondscioh falls

--Beowulf lunges forward and grabs his cloak the others
behind Beowulf grabbing hold of him to keep him secure

They pull Hondscioh back up from the fathomless dark below
HONDSCIOH
(to Grimur)
I guess you didnt know that was
there

GRIMUR
I swear - by Christ --

HONDSCIOH
Lets leave Christ out of this

Hondscioh takes a torch and throws it down into the dark

After only a few seconds it hits rock and skitters onto damp
ground which it briefly illuminates before CRACKLING out

BRECA
(to Beowulf)
Not far but well need ropes
hooks more torches
EXT GRENDELS CAVE -- MOMENTS LATER 86

As the troop exits the cave

-Breca turns back undoes his pants and pisses across the
rocks at the entrance

LAUGHTER from almost all the Geats
Beowulf manages a smile until his gaze meets

-Grimur whose face betrays worry at this act Grimur
turns and hurries down the rocks towards the beach

EXT BEACH -- MOMENTS LATER 87
As the men near their waiting ship

-Beowulf sensing something hangs back but does not turn

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 80

He kneels down appears to adjust a leather thong on his
shoe Abruptly he wheels around to see

»-a small FERAL child - dark and hairy - staring back as
though frozen by being seen Their gazes hold several beats
before the child slips from sight behind boulders

Beowulf glances back towards his company all of whom were
oblivious to the sighting Beowulf turns back to the
rocks

-catches his breath gaze scanning over the forbidding
scape

EXT DANISH SHORELINE BEOWULFS LONGSHIP MOVING -- DAY 88

The men are buoyant - again all but Beowulf and Grimur at
the rear of the boat who scan the shore

THORKEL
-8o they came to the cave of the
killer But found it fled their
weaponss work Undone by dark and
the slime of slope Hondscioh
nearly fell to Valhalla --

HONDSCIOH
Lets uh let this sad tale
sleep

BRECA

Hondscioh shows up - great Odin and
the others ask how he died and
Hondscioh goes - I uh fell
ROARS of LAUGHTER from the group Hondscioh eyes Thorkel

HONDSCIOH
You better find a better line

As Breca at the boats bow leans back pulling hard on his
oar

-a huge creature HAND rises out of the water bronze arm-
ring flashing in the light grabs Breca by the hair and
starts yanking him over

His oar slams into the other in front of him alerting the
men

Thorfinn beside him snatches hold of his legs

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 81
88

The tug is strong and Brecas head dips below the surface
As Beowulf rushes the length of the boat

-Hondscioh nearer Breca grabs an oar and rams it
repeatedly down into the water below Breca

The creature - hit - loosens its grip and shifts under the
boat a mass of long tangled head-hair trailing till it
disappears below

The men haul the unconscious Breca back onto the ship

to find bleeding gouges in his shoulder and a tear in his
scalp

Beowulf spear in hand stares down into the water ready to
strike

but theres nothing more to be seen
INT MEAD HALL -- NIGHT 89
As the Geats are bedding down

Breca - bandaged and grinning - sits before the fire

BRECA
Even the trolls want my beautiful
hair
THORFINN
I think he wanted you for more than
that
LAUGHTER
HONDSCIOH

Great Breca the Troll-house
Pisser Id be more careful where
I wave my spear

BRECA
Id piss in his mouth if he dared
to show it

Best be ready to do more than that

The mood shifts all eyes turning to Beowulf

90 EXT DANISH VILLAGE MEAD HALL PORCH -- NIGHT 20

Beowulf sits just outside the door waiting listening to the
SOUNDS of the night -- wind old songs the sea laughter
His eyelids grow heavy He drifts off

-into a vision of the feral boy standing before him The
child hands him a huge sword which Beowulf takes

The boy then opens his shirt exposing his tiny chest He
looks from the sword to Beowulf and nods go on

Beowulf - heavy-eyed - watches him a beat blinks jolts
awake to

91 EXT DANISH VILLAGE MEAD HALL PORCH -- DAY 91

Beowulf and his warriors are loading their weapons as well
as ropes poles and iron hooks onto the ship

Unferth rides up on a horse Beowulf considers him coolly

BEOWULF
Seems Grendel doesnt mind killing
Christians so long as theyre
Dane

UNFERTH
Can another sword help

Beowulf studies him a beat Walks up to his side

BEOWULF

Hrothgars told me about you and
trolls

(off Unferths

embarrassment)
You back me up you back me up
Fall away on me Ill kill you
myself

With thrown-down torches lighting them from below
the warriors descend by ropes into the cavern
INT GRENDELS CAVE -- MOMENTS LATER

The apprehensive warriors armed with swords shields
spears edge through the damp stinking place

Animal and fish carcasses are scattered about
Each DRIP of water makes someone turn

Some simple tools a pile of wood and a fire-pit but
the torches reach the corners of the cave no Grendel

Beowulf slumps back against a wall sighs - relief and
frustration tangled in a mess in his head

Hondscioh comes upon a small alcove and discovers within
it

CLOSE ON the desiccated HEAD of Grendels father

as

Hondscioh stares in a mix of horror and wonder then takes it
up by the long braided hair holds it out before the others

to see
HONDSCIOH
Look Our friend Grendel doesnt
come from mist and shit alone
As the warriors all watch fascinated
-Hondscioh throws the huge head into the air then - as
falls - he smashes it through with one great swing of his

axe

Eyes wild he then smashes the sections into even smaller
pieces

He stops catches his breath

it

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 84

HONDSCIOH (CONTD)
(soft)
I curse you and all your kin
He looks up and finds Beowulfs troubled gaze Theres
something terrible in what hes done - and they are both
terribly aware
EXT GRENDELS CAVE -- DAY 96

The men finish piling dry grass and sticks around a great
hunk of driftwood in the cave entrance

Unferth moves forward torch in hand
UNFERTH
(fanatical)
For all whove died by the demons

Beowulf trades a glance with Breca who is this madman

after which Unferth throws the torch upon the pile

The men watch the fire rise quickly up around the wood the
smoke twisting down into the cave

EXT DANISH SHORELINE BEOWULFS LONGSHIP MOVING -- DAY 97

EXT SELMAS HUT -- DAY 98
Selma is chopping firewood as

-Beowulf rides up and dismounts His aspect is grim

Selma struggles to mask her apprehension

SELMA
So is it done

BEOWULF
He wasnt in his cave
(beat a demand)
How does he die

Selma gives an ambiguous shrug keeps chopping wood

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 85
98

Beowulf moves toward her and she wheels the axe raised and
ready to throw Beowulf stops

SELMA
Unless your teeth can catch an
axe

Beowulf softens his manner

BEOWULF
I led my men into this not
knowing If Id known Idve come
alone I see doom hanging over
some of them now Doom I brought

Selma considers his concern lowers the axe
SELMA
You found the cave
(beat hesitant)
Thats where I see him dying

BEOWULF
And he wasnt there

SELMA
Would you sit in your cave and wait
for killers who knew the path to
your door
A silence Beowulf slumps back against a fish-drying rack

BEOWULF
What do you know of Christians

The question catches her off-guard She considers a moment

SELMA
Theyre looking for a father

BEOWULF
Whats wrong with Odin

SELMA
Odin gets drunk Wrecks the house

Beowulf nods As she puts down the axe and reaches for
wood

--Beowulf lunges forward and grabs her by the arm

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 86 98

BEOWULF
Take me to Grendel

SELMA
What - ythink I can sniff him
down

BEOWULF

Maybe not but he can sniff you
Beowulf steers her over to his horse grabs a rope and binds
her arms to her sides Selma gives minimal resistance
seeming more bored than anything with the exercise

Beowulf lifts her onto her own horse grabs its reins mounts
his horse and leads them off down the trail

EXT ROCKFACE -- DAY 99

Beowulf and Selma arrive at the rockface up which Grendel
previously lurked Beowulf dismounts turns to the rockface

BEOWULF
Whats the way up from here

SELMA
Straight but youd need claws

Beowulf looks at her darkly circles
Selma gives him an ever-so-faintly-contemptuous look

SELMA
Then again heroes --

He turns on her volatile barely in control She almost
snarls

SELMA
You hit me Ill be the one --

She stops herself but Beowulfs heard enough to wonder

BEOWULF
One to what

Selma looks away

Beowulf takes out his knife He looks like he could do
anything with it For the first time she looks unsure

But he pulls her around and cuts the lash from her wrists

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 87
99

SELMA
I cant stop his death from
coming nor can I hurry it

BEOWULF
He needs to know I know he was
wronged But if he comes to us
again theres nothing I --
SELMA
(ironic)
Youre warning him
Beowulf studies her a beat then remounts his horse
BEOWULF
Careful which side you end up on
Youre a long way from the village

SELMA
Youre a longer way from home

Beowulf eyes her a beat then turns and rides off
INT GRENDELS CAVE -- DAY 100

Through the smoky cave Grendel comes staggering coughing
squinting through the stinging haze

He drops to his knees continues along

Finally his extended hand comes upon the now-empty alcove
He twists about hands then desperately searching the nearby
ground

One hand clutches something brings it up into his sight

CLOSE ON one half of the facial portion of his fathers
skull

Grendel gasps brings the piece to his face sniffs it and
his eyes go hard

He emits a long HOWL - an eerie mix of sorrow and rage
EXT SHORELINE GRENDELS CAVE -- DUSK 101
Grendel eyes wet sits and KEENS banging two rocks against

each other in a hypnotic rhythm his hands bloodied in the
process

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 88

He comes to the end of his song and his hands drop wearily
to his sides He heaves the bloody rocks into the sea

-wipes the blood from his hands across his face - in
warrior-mask

-then turns and fixes for a last time on the setting sun
INT MEAD HALL -- NIGHT 102
With Hondscioh asleep on the next bench over

--Beowulf lies on his tired eyes on the rafters edging to
sleep

EXT DANISH VILLAGE PERIMETER -- NIGHT 103
The silence of the night

PAN DOWN the outer stone perimeter to a GUARD impaled on
a wooden spike

And Grendel continues through the boulders the blood caked
heavy on his face his eyes wide almost trance-like

INT MEAD HALL -- CONTINUOUS 104

A long silence then the very faint sound of BREATHING on
the other side of the doors

The oak doors begin to creak with an awesome and steady
pressure As the doors bend in

-Beowulf twists toward them Theres resignation on his
face his fate shall now come He takes his battle breath

BEOWULF
Wake up men or never again

Theres the sudden CRACK of splitting wood and the doors
securing beam snaps apart

The warriors leap up taking hold of weapons
The doors fly open and Grendel - silhouetted - charges in
Beowulf no weapon in hand rushes toward him

-but Grendel as quickly shifts into the darkness

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 89
104

As Beowulf turns frantically about fearful for his men
searching out the form through the confusion of them
scrambling for their weapons

Grendel shifts past him snatches up the still-blinking
Thorkel - sniffs him - not what Grendel is looking for

Grendel flings him to one side
-reaches and snatches up the next one - Hondscioh
As Hondscioh struggles to get his sword in play Grendel
pulls Hondsciohs other hand to his face sniffs him once to
make sure
GRENDEL
(soft in Old
NorseIcelandic)
For my father
then deftly snaps his neck

ON Beowulf turning just in time to see and his horror
gives way to fury

As Beowulf charges towards him

-Grendel twists around and throws Hondsciohs corpse at
him knocking him down

As Beowulf struggles out from the grim embrace of his dead
friend

Grendel reaches for Breca but a sword swings down and
slashes Grendel across the upper arm Grendel seething
turns to find

-Unferth there bringing back his sword for another swing

UNFERTH
By Christ demon you shall die

But before he can swing his sword

-Grendel backhands him sending him flying against the
outer wall

Grendel reaches again for Breca but his arm is waylaid

CLOSE ON a fierce handgrip upon his wrist

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 90
104 104

He turns and sees the wild-eyed gaze of Beowulf as
Beowulfs other hand grabs Grendel by the hair and tugs back
his neck
A spear thrown by a Geat slams against Grendels chest but
bounces off Beowulf tugging Grendel into the torchlight
only then sees

-the iron-mail-shirt binding Grendels torso

Grendel stares into Beowulfs face Theyre frozen for a
moment

theres almost sadness - wonder - in their looks

then Grendel throws back his arm - Beowulf still attached -
and the two tumble back against the wall

They wrestle across the floor tumble over benches through

tables

the other Geat warriors circling weapons raised to
strike
But the target is impossible to fix on the two figures -

Grendel and Beowulf - twisting about as one

Finally Grendel smashes Beowulf against the wall and gets
free of one of Beowulfs hands

He turns toward the door meaning to escape but finds

a massive fishing NET dropped across the exit and
between it and him a cluster of strong and determined Geats
standing with spears and shields levelled at him

-but worse than that Beowulf is still holding on

Grendel smacks Beowulf again against the wall forcing
Beowulfs grip to loosen Grendel tugs free

and scrambles up the wall like a monkey to the second
floor

Beowulf with blood gushing from his face runs up the stairs
after him

Grendel finding the upper balcony door bolted smashes at it
till it starts to give way

But then Beowulf is once again upon him

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 91 104

With one hand Grendel smashes at the door the other
struggling to throw off Beowulf

Grendel charges the door with his shoulder and it gives way
bringing them out into

EXT MEAD HALL BALCONY -- CONTINUOUS 105
-the night

As Grendel dragging Beowulf struggles to the railing
-Beowulf frees one of his hands long enough to snatch hold

of a hanging rope which he then deftly knots about the wrist

of Grendels already-gouged-and-bleeding arm

Grendel swings wildly back with his other arm but Beowulf
avoids it though he lets go his grip

Grendel snarls then vaults over the railing

-but drops only a few feet before the rope snaps taut his
full weight wrenching down on the shoulder joint A
sickening POP as the arm dislocates from the socket He
SCREECHES pain

ON Beowulf wincing at the scream

CLOSE ON the shoulder muscles already cut continue to
shift and TEAR from the strain

and he twists in the air suspended several feet above the
ground

Beowulf brings up a spear is trying to line it up fora
death-throw

-but Grendel continues to twist too wildly
EXT DANISH VILLAGE MEAD HALL -- CONTINUOUS 106

As the Geat warriors spill out through the doorway they are
just as quickly mesmerized

-by Grendel twisting above them

Several warriors hurl their spears up at him One or two
ricochet off his mailshirt one lodges in his hip

Grendel wrenches the spear out of his flesh in turning
fixes on

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 92
106

Beowulf leaning wounded on the balcony torn gaze fixed
on Grendel
Grendel manages something most resembling a shrug then
fiercely jams the spear point back in - this time at the

muscle and sinew of his distended shoulder

The spear-gouge does its work the flesh finally shreds the
arm tearing off from the shoulder

and Grendel drops in a heap to the ground
The warriors freeze staring
Grendel struggles to his feet turns on them - SCREECHES -
then with his other hand clasped across the pouring wound
charges through the standing warriors - bowling several over -
and continues off into the darkness
-those left standing too mesmerized to pursue him
EXT MEAD HALL BALCONY -- MOMENTS LATER 107
Beowulf also bleeding profusely undoes the rope
EXT DANISH VILLAGE MEAD HALL -- CONTINUOUS 108
--and the gory trophy of the ARM drops to the ground
The warriors edge up to it in awe
EXT WILDS -- NIGHT 109
Grendel staggerweaves on through the night weakening with
blood-loss his breaths coming in gasps the ROAR of the
sea rising
EXT BEACH -- CONTINUOUS 110
Grendel comes through rocks out onto the pebble beach He
staggers forward tumbles to his knees rises staggers
several blind steps more until his feet reach the water

and only then does he let his legs come to rest

Hes almost falling as he stands blood draining into the
water

He stares up into the starry sky - knowing its the last time

- blinks desperately struggling to focus A kind of wonder
sweeps over him relief a sad smile

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 93
110

-he shudders eyes close bloody hand drops to his side
and he falls into the surf

-his body limp cradled by the waves
Something then shifts through the water to one side of him

Another arm - much like his - breaks the surface reaches up
takes hold of Grendels shoulder and pulls him down below
the water

EXT DANISH VILLAGE MEAD HALL -- DAY 111
As a couple of warriors carry Hondsciohs body out

-Beowulf surrounded by Breca and several other Geats
watch from their horses

Hrothgar approaches eyes Hondsciohs corpse

HROTHGAR
Now you truly know our loss

Beowulf edges out of hearing of the others

BEOWULF
You only gave us half the tale

HROTHGAR
The other half would dull your
sword

Beowulf dismounts eyes Hrothgar evenly

BEOWULF
That troll didnt give a shit about
us not until we wronged him He
killed one He couldve killed
more He killed the one he held in
blame

The same cliffs from the opening sequence

Hrothgar raises up his battle-mask holds up his torch peers
down into the rocks and sees

CLOSE ON the face of the tiny troll-child - Grendel -
shuddering with fear staring up

Hrothgars breath catches in his throat He stares a moment
more

-then he heaves his torch off the cliff as far out in the
sea as he can

DISSOLVE TO
EXT MEAD HALL -- DAY 113

Hrothgars expression echoes that of the memory one of
puzzlement but now deepened with guilt and regret

HROTHGAR
None of the others saw the child
(beat shrugs)
I couldve quelled it there and
then but weakness stopped my
spear

BEOWULF
Or kindness

HROTHGAR
Then its the hardest kindness I
know

Hrothgar reaches under his shirt and brings out a Christian
crucifix and his Thor-hammer pendant - each on its own silver
chain Considers them both

HROTHGAR (CONTD)
And now all gods run from me as
though I were the death itself

Hrothgar turns and walks toward the mead hall entrance
Beowulf following

So what had the father done Why
did you kill him

Hrothgar continues toward the hall brooding on the question
He stops in the shadow of the doorway struggling

And then he continues in

HROTHGAR

The pathetic pettiness of Hrothgars answer sweeps over him
before he speaks it

HROTHGAR (CONTD)
He took a fish

Hrothgar looks to Beowulf then gazes up to the central
rafter

onto which several Danes are mounting Grendels arm
roping it up then driving spikes through it to hold it to the
beam

WIDEREVEAL the hall full of Danes and Geats drinking and
feasting in celebration

and beside Beowulf a pile of gifts a great gold banner
a glimmering mail-shirt an ornate sword

Its a raucous party a vent for the fear thats hung over
these people a loud celebration of the relief they now feel

WITH a half-drunk Unferth leaning in to Brendan who - though
also tipsy - is tiring of Unferths confession

UNFERTH

awkwardly accepts the gesture

Tears start streaming from Hrothgars eyes
HROTHGAR
(between laughs)

I tell you I tell you if he

ever comes here again Ill send

out a batch of squirrels Thatll

slow him

More hysterical laughter and tears and gradually the mask
of humour falls and Hrothgar is reduced to tearful
gasps the fear climbing back into his eyes

Beowulf pats his shoulder

BEOWULF
Its over now The trolls dead

Wealhtheow comes up sees Hrothgars state
WEALHTHEOW

Grendel is methodically thrusting into Selma from behind
She is crying quietly gasping her eyes wide in confusion

Grendel climaxes with little apparent emotion - just a few
breaths heavier than previously - then he places Selma back
on her bed face-down and pulls the blanket back up over
her

Selma remains where she is in shock but no longer crying
only softly panting from the effort and the fear as it ebbs
away her eyes wide

--and as Grendels breathing also softens there comes the
CREAKING steps of his exit

shimmering in the flicker of fire-light Her beauty He

He staggers back a step more stunned than offended

BEOWULF
Where did that have its birth

SELMA
You thinking you can tie me up and
drag me like a dog
(beat)
Dont forget I know how you die

Beowulf is jolted Almost as much as when she rises up to
him and kisses him - hard

They tentatively reach for each other

She abruptly pulls him to her driving her face along the
sides of his throat feeling his hair against her cheek

He kisses her face and she swings her mouth to his - kisses
him hungrily

As their hands explore each others bodies

Selma works her way across his chest - the first time shes
had this control in years - if ever at all

BEOWULF

Been a while

her breasts are discernible beneath her hide-shift as is her
wild and grizzled mane its Grendels mother - the SEA-HAG
Shes the same genesis as Grendel slightly smaller - but
with greater vengeance Bronze snaking arm-rings encircle
her powerful forearms

She edges between the sleeping warriors more cautious than
her son till her eyes alight on

-Grendels arm nailed to the rafters

Grief is quickly overwhelmed by fury She tears the arm down
off its spike As she turns

the WARRIOR nearest to her stirs and looks up She grabs
him by the throat SHRIEKS and throws him into the fire-pit

As the warriors now struggle out of sleep she strides
purposely for the door her sons arm clutched under her own

As she nears the door Aeschere steps in front of her sword
drawn blocking her path

Beowulf makes his way along the murky channel the ceiling at
most a foot above the water in many spots entirely

submerged

the only light filtering up through the water from the
cave

A wash of water smacks him against the rock

He gulps water - chokes - gasps for air

Clinging to an outcrop he regains his breath Continues on
The ceiling now descends a foot into the water

But - through the murk - he can make out some form of BLUISH
LIGHT bleeding through the water from beyond the next rock

He steels himself takes the deepest breath he can then
dives down into the water legs furiously kicking

INT SEA-HAGS ICE-CAVE -- CONTINUOUS 140
Beowulf bursts up out of the water

into an ice-cave through one wall of which the outside
light faintly glows

Cautiously he edges out of the water onto the sand

Against one wall is a pile of treasure gilded weapons
shields and the skeleton heads of humans

He continues on into the semi-dark of a rock passage and
almost stumbles over

-Grendels corpse The arm-socket wound has been sealed
with pitch but too late for Grendel Blood saturates the
sand

A few feet away lies the great torn-off arm
Beowulf turns the head by its hair peers into the face

-when a SHRIEK comes from behind He wheels

and the Sea-Hag is upon him

She wildly claws at him with one hand while trying to stab
him with the knife she holds in the other

Beowulf breaks free of her swings with his sword but it
hardly cuts through the walrus-hide

She strikes out and her fingernails tear across his ribs He
falls into the water and she leaps upon him

They wrestle twisting under the surface

then rise Beowulf having slipped behind her and taken
hold of her hands

She lurches backwards smashing him against the rocks

As his grip loosens she swings him partway in front of her
slashes down one arm with her knife and his blood pours
from the wound

Beowulf stumbles clear of the Sea-Hag eyes

--a giants sword in the treasure pile of which he takes
hold

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 111

The Sea-Hag rushes toward him
-and he only has time to swing the blade upward
Slashing across her neck and face

She SCREECHES pain twists about eyes going blind and
collapses into the water

-blood gushing from her and staining the water
--as Beowulf collapses in the sand
Beowulf trudges back to Grendels corpse stands over it

-when he hears a sound - a living GASP - from behind him
He wheels around

-but the Sea-Hag lies where she was half her body in the
water the other half in the sand

Beowulf leaves Grendel edges past the fire-pit toward the
darker recesses of the cave Edging around a rock he
sees

the GLIMMER of a blade and raises his own prepared to
strike As he moves another step forward hes confronted
by

CLOSE ON the feral boy hiding in the rocks holding a
dagger out at Beowulf terror in his tear-ridden eyes

-but the boy then charges wildly slashing with his dagger
Beowulf shifts clear of the charge

and the child continues over to the body of Grendel where
he wheels around squats down dagger extended protecting
the corpse

Beowulf studies him a beat Beowulfs sword still raised

BEOWULF
Your father

Its unclear if its a challenge or only confirmation

The child sensing its the former swallows then defiantly
nods preparing to be attacked

Beowulf eyes still frenzied blinks through the blood on his
face Shakes the dizziness from his head

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 112 140

Wipes the blood from his eyes with his arm and now clearly
sees the childs fear

He stares dully a long beat his mind twisting around on
itself Finally he softens sighs lets his sword drop to
his side

Then you can be proud

The two study each other a beat
-then Beowulf turns starts back toward the water
A GASP to one side of Beowulf He twists around to find

-the Sea-Hag eyes blood-blinded trudging slowly toward
him He raises his sword point held outward

The Sea-Hag slows to a teetering stop several feet from him
Her bloody hands vaguely explore the air before her

Beowulfs expression softens

and in that moment one of her hands snaps out and grabs
hold of the extended blade

Beowulf transfixed holds his ground

The Sea-Hag then - incrementally - edges forward till the
blade-point touches her abdomen She lets out a painful
breath

And then teeth clenched she edges forward again

She lets out a GASP as the sword penetrates her skin

Her head falls back the wild hair shifting off her face
revealing features of fierce beauty

Beowulf - overwhelmed and transfixed - lets go of the sword
and shifts out of the way

The Sea-Hag continues forward Finally the sword-hilt meets
the wall of the cave She feels the resistance

-drags in a breath

then pushes forward the sword moving through her and
emerging out her back

She sighs staggers a couple steps then falls back dead
into the water

Thorkels tale is shit

Beowulf and Grendel - 10th dr - Berzins - July 1204 - 118
149

Beowulf looks across to the shore and sees through the
fog

the feral child following along the rocks

Beowulf watches as

the child comes to the end of the rocky spit The fog
clears enough to reveal on the rocks several feet above
him

--Selma standing driftwood in hand also watching them go

CLOSE ON her face and the ghost of a smile

The fog thickens mother and child disappearing into the
land

Beowulf blinks his eyes now watering He wipes them looks
again

-but theres nothing visible but rock and water
Beowulf turns his grim gaze back to the sea

BEOWULF
By Odins will

Unexpectedly to Beowulf a chorus of voices of the other
Geats rise in the prayer

UNISON
let us find our way home

Beowulf looks out over the others all of whom are fixed on
him

He nods and turns his gaze
-back out on the sea
FADE OUT

END END END
