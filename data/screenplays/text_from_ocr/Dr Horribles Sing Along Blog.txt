PENNY
Ok we’re hoping to open up a new location soon expand
our efforts There’s this great building nearby that
the city is just going to demolish and turn into a
parking lot but if we get enough signatures

DR HORRIBLE
Signatures «pfftx«

PENNY
Yeah

DR HORRIBLE
I’m sorry go on

PENNY
I was saying um maybe we could get the city to donate
the building to our cause We would be able to provide
250 new beds get people off the streets and into job
training so they could buy rocket packs and go to
the moon and become florists You’re not really
interested in the homeless are you

DR HORRIBLE
No I am But they’re a symptom You’re treating a
symptom and the disease rages on consumes the human
race The fish rots from the head as they say So my
thinking is why not cut off the head

PENNY
Of the human race

DR HORRIBLE
It’s not a perfect metaphor but I’m talking about an
overhaul of the system Putting the power in
DIFFERENT hands

PENNY
I’m all for that This petition is about the
building

ARISE AND SING
SO YOUR WORLDS BENIGN
SO YOU THINK JUSTICE HAS A VOICE
AND WE ALL HAVE A CHOICE
WELL NOW YOUR WORLD IS MINE

CHORUS
(EVERYTHING YOU EVER)

DR HORRIBLE
AND I AM FINE

DR HORRIBLE

NOW DR HORRIBLE IS HERE
TO MAKE YOU QUAKE WITH FEAR
TO MAKE THE WHOLE WORLD KNEEL

CHORUS
EVERYTHING YOU EVER

DR HORRIBLE
AND I WON’T FEEL
