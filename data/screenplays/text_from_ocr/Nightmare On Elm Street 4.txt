A BLACK SCREEN

As the MAIN TITLES begin two sounds are heard The first is
the low moaning WIND The second is a slow SCREECHING
Its the kind of noise that makes you grit your teeth

FADE IN
EXT ELM STREET - DAY

GRAY SURFACE FILLS THE SCREEN At first its hard to
recognize this rough indistinct surface But when a CHILDS
HAND drags a piece of colored chalk ACROSS THE FRAME we
realize that were seeing a very close view of a CONCRETE
WALKWAY

EXT ELM STREET - DAY

A SERIES OF CLOSE SHOTS FOLLOW THE MOVEMENTS of the tiny hand
as it proceeds to lay out an intricate CHALK DRAWING on the
walkway

For a while we are too close to identify the image that is
being created But as THE CAMERA PULLS BACK we see a
youthful artists representation of a two story HOUSE

The CAMERA TILTS UP revealing a LITTLE GIRL in white dress
Shes holding a handful of colored chalk Behind her sits
the ELM STREET HOUSE

As the TITLES END we
EXT ELM STREET - DAY

The trees lining this residential street are bare and they
sway in the breeze thats blowing their dead leaves across
the sidewalk

KRISTEN a beautiful but pensive-looking blonde teenager is
walking slowly towards the ominous house Although her face
shows signs of fear she is moving with resolve

EXT ELM STREET HOUSE - DAY

Kristen stops and looks down at the angelic little girl who
has been creating the childish drawing of Freddys house
Kneeling down beside her Kristen takes a closer look at the
colorful chalk sketch

It has an almost exaggerated cheerfulness And although
awkwardly rendered it makes the house look new and the yard
well-tended The idyllic sidewalk illustration looks nothing
like its subject which has peeling paint boarded-up
windows and is horribly run-down

LITTLE GIRL
(looking up)
Hello

KRISTEN
Do you live here

LITTLE GIRL
(sadly)
Nobody lives here

KRISTEN
Wheres Freddy

LITTLE GIRL
(giggles strangely)
Hes not home

Just then the child lifts her hand away from the picture
What Kristen sees makes her gasp A crudely drawn but
easily recognizable image of FREDDY KRUEGER is visible behind
one of the windows

There is a CRACK of LIGHTNING and drops of rain start to
sprinkle down on to the girl and her drawing

EXT ELM STREET HOUSE - NIGHT

Kristen glances up at the sky Rain trickles onto her face
Then after a second she looks back down at the sidewalk
THE LITTLE GIRL IS GONE Kristen scans the area but the
child is nowhere to be seen

Rain is splashing down on the chalk illustration Not only is
the image washing away but as the colors blend together
they form a liquid that looks just like BLOOD

Kristen hears a CREAKING NOISE coming from the direction of
the house She turns and stares at the menacing structure
The front door is SLOWLY OPENING Somehow Kristen seems
unsurprised by this And as though drawn by an
uncontrollable urge she turns toward the house With
thunder and lightning crashing above her she walks
deliberately toward the open door

INT ENTRANCE HALLWAY - NIGHT

As soon as Kristen enters the house she hears VOICES behind
her Its CHILDREN SINGING a strange nursery rhyme

CHILDRENS VOICES (0S)
One two Freddys coming for you

Kristen spins around and looks back through the open door
EXT FRONT YARD - NIGHT - KRISTENS POV

standing out in the yard that was empty a moment before are a
dozen very young CHILDREN Dressed in their Sunday best
they are staring at Kristen as they continue to sing

CHILDREN
Three four better lock the door

INT ENTRANCE HALLWAY - NIGHT

The front door SLAMS SHUT with a bang Kristens determined
expression dissolves and she reaches back for the doorknob
It turns without resistance and the door opens with ease

Kristen rushes through the doorway but instead of finding
herself outside she is in

INT A DUPLICATE ENTRANCE HALLWAY - NIGHT

Kristens eyes widen as she compares her surroundings with
the dusty decaying room that is visible on the other side of
the still-open door They are exactly the same

Before she can take another step the door slams shut again
And this time when she tries to open it its locked solid

KRISTEN
(muttering)
Calm and cool Im calm and cool

She moves down the hall finds an open door steps through
INT DARK ELM STREET LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Kristen walks in the old floorboards creaking under her
feet She looks at the walls They are lined with eerie
paintings of children playing in graveyards Rainwater drips
down from the ceiling

When FLASHES OF LIGHTNING illuminate the room Kristen
catches sights of an old and dusty couch in one corner A
couch with a distinctive RED AND GREEN STRIPED LINING

Another bolt FLASHES Kristen is horrified to see
silhouetted on one of the walls the shadow of a hand with
long knife-like fingers

So frightened that she can barely breathe Kristen turns to
the LARGE WINDOW across the room

ANOTHER FLASH lights up the dark room and Kristen relaxes
It isnt Freddy outside the window Its only a tree branch

Relieved Kristen starts over toward the window But before
she reaches it there is a sudden massive CLAP OF THUNDER
and the entire window EXPLODES into the room

A huge gust of WIND roars in through the shattered window
and blows Kristen off her feet

INT FREDDYS BOILER ROOM - NIGHT
Kristen tumbles down a set of heavy metal chute that has just
appeared out of nowhere and lands on the concrete floor of a
very large dark Boiler Room She scrambles to her feet and
looks around terrified like a trapped animal

KRISTEN
(under her breath)
Hes not here hes dead Hes not here
hes dead Hes

Just then Kristen hears the unmistakable SOUND of Freddys
knives scraping against a nearby metal surface

KRISTEN (contd)
(crying out)
No Kincaide Joey Help me

INT KINCAIDS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kincaid is sitting at his desk his head drooped down over an
open copy of an illustrated sports magazine A harmless-
looking MONGREL is sleeping at his feet

Suddenly Kincaids chair BEGINS TO SHAKE He lifts his head
in surprise just as he suddenly flies from the chair and
sails through the air straight towards a wall in his room

But instead of piling into the solid surface Kincaid sails
right through it and DISAPPEARS into the void

INT BOILER ROOM - NIGHT

Kincaid falls into the Boiler Room crashing through a pile
of rusty pipes and boilers As soon as he catches his
breath he looks up and sees Kristen He quickly jumps to
his feet and starts to yell at his friend

KINCAID
Awww shit Kristen not again

Kristen motions for Kincaid to LISTEN as the SCREECHING
continues

Kincaid unimpressed shows Kristen that its merely the
metal arature of a boiler attachment SCRAPING against a
railing

KINCAID (contd)
You are one spooked chick

Before Kincaid can say another word Kristen holds up her
hand FOOTSTEPS are echoing out of the shadows behind them

KRISTEN
Shh

They both spin around just as a FIGURE lurches toward them
Kincaid gasps and Kristen screams But a moment later thy
each let out big sighs Its JOEY Kincaid covers his fear
with cool nonchalance

KRISTEN (contd)
Joey thank God I thought

JOEY
Thought what Of dragging us in here

KINCAID
Yeah cut it out Youre puttin a dent
in my beauty sleep

They both glare at Kristen Theyre pissed

KRISTEN
(in a halting voice)
Its Freddy Hes here I heard him

KINCAID
Chill out KristenFreddys dead
buried and consecrated We won
remember

KRISTEN
(shaking her head)
Hes back to get us

JOEY
Now way Kincaids right Fred Krueger is
history cmere

He leads her around the Boiler Room He makes her touch
pipes and then positions her in front of the large furnace

JOEY (contd)
Look The pipes are cold the boiler is
cold see for yourself

He swings open the iron door on the furnace Kristen moves
close to look in the black void There isnt even the glow

of an ember inside She turns away

KRISTEN
I dont know

ALL AT ONCE a howling BEAST leaps out of the furnace Its
Kincaids dog Kristen has managed to pull it into her dream

with its master

The terrified animal clamps its jaws around Kristens arm
and knocks the screaming girl down to the floor

INT JOEYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Joey wakes up with a start and tries to re-orient himself
His sudden movements cause his waterbed to slosh back and
forth like crazy

INT KINCAIDS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kincaid jerks his head up off his desk and glances around
his room with an expression of relief Then he hears a
WHIMPERING sound and looks down

His dog is staring up at him with uncomprehending eyes
There is BLOOD around the animals mouth

INT KRISTENS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kristen throws her covers off and jumps up out of bed Shes
breathing hard and her arm is BLEEDING Grabbing a T-shirt
off a chair Kristen wraps it around the wound

She sits back down on her bed She looks really scared

FADE OUT
FADE IN
EXT ALICES HOUSE - DAY

The morning sun is rising behind the broad-limbed trees that
shade a collection of unassuming homes Its a peaceful
neighborhood Just the kind that Freddy used to like

A girl pulls up in front of one house Shes driving a VW
Rabbit Convertible

Its Kristen She wears a long sleeve shirt but a bulge
reveals where her arm is bandaged

EXT ALICE AND RICKS HOUSE - DAY

Kristen quickly walks to the side door of a modest house
After ringing the bell she glances out at the sidewalk When
Kristen turns back a STERN-LOOKING MAN is standing in the
open doorway Although probably not much over forty DENNIS
JOHNSONS face shows a lot of wear too much scotch too much
work Hes dressed for work and is preparing to leave but
his hangover is self-evident

KRISTEN
How are you Mr Johnson

Johnson ignores her

KRISTEN (contd)
Thats nice

Johnson turns away His daughter ALICE shows up at the door
slinking warily by her father In a definite contrast to
Kristens easy beauty Alice is not especially well put
together And yet theres something about this shy-looking
girl that suggests that she might be incredibly attractive if
she had any confidence

ALICE
(low)
Hi KristenRickll be out any second

Kristen looks in the doorway at Johnson who is holding a
tomato-juice and spices hangover delight Kristen makes a
face Alice turns as Johnson looks up

JOHNSON
(to Alice)
You going out dressed like that

ALICE
(defensive)
Whats wrong with me this time

KRISTEN
(embarrassed)
Uhh Ill just wait outside

JOHNSON
No its okay Maybe you can help her

Johnson pours a shot of Vodka into his morning concoction and
SLAMS the door shut leaving the two girls alone on the front
porch Kristen is about to console Alice when they HEAR a
RUSTLING sound above them RICK Alices brother is
shimmying out of an upper floor window

He reaches for a nearby tree and with surprising grace he
maneuvers to the ground and lands smiling in front of the
girls He gives Kristen a quick kiss

KRISTEN
Something wrong with the stairs

RICK
Avoid-all-contact-day

KRISTEN
What

RICK
When dads popping aspiring like popcorn

its avoid-all-contact-day

Johnson suddenly reopens the door and reaches for the morning
newspaper He stares at the kids

JOHNSON
Waiting for a limo

Rick grabs his fathers face and gives him a big noisy kiss
on the cheek

RICK
(mock Ricky Ricardo)
Okay honey Im off to the club

The girls chuckle as Johnson becomes embarrassed and SLAMS
the door on the kids

EXT SPRINGWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Springwood High doesnt look particularly inviting but how
many high schools do STUDENTS are arriving on foot on
bikes and in a variety of motor vehicles

Kristen Rick and Alice pull up in Kristens VW Rabbit
Convertible and park They step onto the sidewalk and cross
along beside the STUDENT PARKING LOT They stop beside an
ATTRACTIVE GIRL who is leaning against a car listening to
the blasting radio inside

The girl DEBBIE STEVENS is one well put together item A
tough but smart girl from the wrong side of the tracks
trying to compensate for her roots with defensive spunk
sexy and she knows it

DEBBIE
Alright anybody have trig this semester

Alice Rick and Kristen shake their heads no

RICK

DEBBIE
I had a conflict Homework or Dynasty

Debbie eyes him too
DEBBIE
(appreciative)

JUMP CUT to Dan standing directly in front of Alice Shes
in a more confident seductive pose She looks him up and
down and flashes a Lauren Bacall smile

ALICE

She puts a hand on Dans waist He grows nervous and
awkward as if hes the shy one now

DAN
(stammers )

EXT SCHOOL - DAY (BACK TO REALITY)

RICK (0S)
Earth to Alice

Alice snaps out of it Dan is suddenly back where he was
walking away with a group of his friends

RICK (contd)
You spacing again

ALICE
(hush-hush)
Rick please

DEBBIE
Alright I think I see salvation

A battered and sputtering VESPA SCOOTER is zipping towards
them through the parking lot The BLACK GIRL riding the
scooter looks a bit nerdy with thick glasses and short hair
but makes up for it with a hip sense of style Her scooter
has been souped up with a few home-made gadgets and
attachments

As soon as SHEILA KOPECKY reaches them she hops off her
bike and unstraps the pile of books and papers from the
back Tons of SMOKE pour out the back of it

DEBBIE (contd)
(bats smoke away)
How can you ride that health hazard
Its no wonder you have asthma

SHEILA
Asthma is an inherited condition If you
read a book now and then you might know
something

DEBBIE
Speaking of books isnt trig your
favorite
Sheila stares at Debbie a beat

SHEILA
Dynasty again huh Girl get a VCR

Sheila pulls out her asthma inhaler and sticks it in her
mouth She takes a few puffs A cocky obnoxious BLACK JOCK
walks by and comments to Sheila

JOCK
Yo baby youre sucking on the wrong
nozzle

Sheila is embarrassed and falls short of managing a retort
Debbie steps in between Sheila and the jock and does it for
her

DEBBIE
Hey needledick I bet youre the only
male in this school suffering from penis
envy

The jock stares in confusion not quite understanding the
insult Our group cracks up and pats Debbie on the shoulders
as the jock walks off

SHEILA
Alright I owe you one

Debbie suddenly stops laughing and lets out a disgusted GASP
A huge ROACH is crawling around her books She shakes the
book until the bug falls off then grinds it under her foot
a little too enthusiastically

RICK
Supergirl I think its dead

The group gets their stuff together and heads for class
INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

STUDENTS are moving through the hallway that cuts through the
center of Springwood High

Kristen is standing against one wall spinning the dial on
her locker Rick can be seen a dozen lockers down from her

Kristen gets the locker open grabs a couple of her books

then slams it shut But as the locker door swings away it
SUDDENLY REVEALS the faces of Kincaid and Joey just inches

from Kristen They startle the hell out of her

KRISTEN
Higuys

KINCAID
Hi guys Hi guys Thats all you

Kristen studies her two angry friends for a moment then
speaks up in a firm voice

KRISTEN

KINCAID

Listen little sister we know you got

KINCAID

Kristen wants to believe but she cant because

KRISTEN
Then what about this

Kristen pulls up her sleeve and reveals the blood-stained
bandage on her forearm

KINCAID
That dont mean dick My dogs like me
Drag him into a crazy dream and he gets
wild

The guys see Rick approaching

KINCAID (contd)
(jokingly trying to change the
subject)
Here comes your boyfriend Cant he give
you a good nights sleep

Rick arrives in time to hear Kincaids comment

RICK
We dont kiss and tell How ‘bout you

Kincaide starts to mount a comeback but Joey pulls him away
Kristen watches them disappear into the crowd

RICK (contd)
Those guys are kind of spooky
KRISTEN
Then you must think Im a total freak

Rick ponders this

RICK
I go back and forth

Kristen is not amused

RICK (contd)
Lighten up No one died

Rick strokes her cheek Kristen forces a weak smile
INT KINCAIDS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kincaid is getting into bed His night time attire consists
of a T-shirt and a pair of sweat pants

As the sleepy young man settles between the sheets a FORCE
begins to slowly open the door behind him It SQUEAKS as it
inches open Kincaid is on alert After a few moments of
suspense Kincaids mangy dog shoves the door the rest of the
way open and trots into the room

The mutt hops up onto the bed and circles a couple of times
When it finally lies down Kincaid shoves it over a bit

KINCAID
Come on Jason move over

The dog and his master adjust their positions then Kincaid
reaches over and turns off the light

CLOSE ON KINCAID

His eyes slowly shut The room is still But suddenly a
SCREECHING SOUND wakes him

INT CAR TRUNK - NIGHT

Kincaid opens his eyes Its too dark for him to see much
so he reaches for the light on his bedstand But instead of
finding a lamp his hand slams against a metal surface

He tries to move around but bumps his head on something low

KINCAID
Yo open this sucker up

He pounds on the metal above It moves just enough to reveal
a thin crack of blue light He continues to mutter to

himself in confusion

He pounds a few more times starting to panic when the metal
above his head finally pops open
EXT JUNKYARD - NIGHT

Kincaid sticks his head out of the trunk of a wrecked car and
looks around Hes in an ominous auto graveyard

KINCAID
This aint my dreamland KRISTEN IF
YOU HERE IM GONNA POUND YOUR ASS

Kincaid looks around No ones to be seen

KINCAID (contd)
(calling)
Kristen Hey Kristen
(beat then sheepishly)
Kristen

He collects himself and puts on a badass walking gait When
he hears a low GROWLING Kincaid looks down A few feet away
from him is his dog It has an odd expression on its face

KINCAID (contd)
Jason

EXT CAR BOX CANYON - NIGHT

The dog is furiously digging below the back of an imposing-
looking OLD CADILLAC Some strange instinct seems to have
overpowered the animal

The boy rushes forward and tries to stop his dog But its
no longer acting like a friendly pet and it turns and snarls
at him viciously

Kincaid stops and stares in disbelief as the dog lifts its
leg and PISSES FIRE onto the spot where its been digging

A FLAMING STREAM runs along the ground and a moment later
the earth RUMBLES and starts to CRACK OPEN along this line of
fire Shafts of light erupt out of the crack

Its job complete the dog howls and runs off into the night
Kincaid watches it disappear between the stacks of cars then
steps forward and looks down into the SMOLDERING PIT

EXT FREDDYS GRAVE - NIGHT

Down at the bottom of this freshly formed crevice a pile of
BONES is forming itself into a HUMAN SKELETON They click
together like a machine gun put together by an experienced
soldier

And as if that isnt creepy enough a body is quickly
REGENERATING
FLESH appears on the bones Cartilage knits the joints and
muscle swells within the OOZING TISSUE that is forming all
over the body Its the antithesis of decomposition

When BURNED SKIN forms over the flesh and clothes reverse
their rot and cover the skin there is no longer any doubt
whos rebirth we are witnessing

EXT CAR BOX CANYON - NIGHT

Kincaid watches in horror as the sinister figure rises from
the grave FREDDYS BACK

Freddy raises his right hand and with a flick of his wrist
extends the long shiny BLADES at the ends of the fingers
(like switch blades)

FREDDY
You shouldntve buried meIm not
dead

Kincaid doesnt hesitate for another second Before Freddy
even starts to move toward him the terrified dreamer turns
and runs He finds the opening where he entered and madly
squeezes himself back through it

EXT LABYRINTH OF CARS - NIGHT

Kincaid starts to weave his way through the maze of piled-up
cars

He turns a corner and pauses to catch his breath He looks
around Theres no sign of Freddy Breathing hard he turns
around at the piles of cars around him The expression on
his face tells us hes got an idea

ON FREDDY

He round the corner and stops theres no Kincaid He looks
around confused He HEARS the SQUEAK of metal

ON KINCAID

Whos on top of a pile of cars Hes straining with his
super dream-strength to push the top car off the pile He
succeeds

The car topples down onto Freddy squashing him flat A
victorious Kincaid jumps down onto the roof then hood of the
car

KINCAID
Take that mutha-fucker

Kincaide jumps to the ground As soon as he lands the cars
around him go wild HORNS HONK lights flash windshield
wipers wipe
Suddenly before Kincaid can react cars start to pile in
around him He spins around to watch as he is quickly boxed
in by piles of cars which come crashing in

Kincaid is boxed in like a trapped mouse The HORNS on the
cars around him HONK and headlights flash at him

There is no way out Hes completely trapped in a space not
much larger than a single car

Suddenly Kincaid hears a SCRAPING NOISE right behind him
Freddys claws are SCRAPING a windshield

He spins around and finds FREDDY standing just inches away
with his knives raised

Freddy brings his blades down and jams them into Kincaids
chest

KINCAID (contd)
(gurgling)
Kiss my ass Ill see you in hell

FREDDY
(smiling)
Tell them Freddy sent ya HAHAHAHA

Freddy pushes the knives farther and farther into Kincaid
The tips of the sharp blades POP out of the center of
Kincaids back ONE AT A TIME ACCENTED BY CRUEL SOUND FX

FREDDY (contd)
One downtwo to gohahahah

INT KINCAIDS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kincaids eyes shoot open and he clutches his chest in agony
His dog wakes and nuzzles up to his dying master but the boy
is oblivious to the dogs tender attention

With his final breath Kincaid tries unsuccessfully to call
out Kristens name

INT KRISTENS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kristen is sitting in bed with her knees drawn to her chest
Holding her breath shes listening The room is silent It
must have been the wind tickling the chimes outside her
window that drew her attention

She sighs and reaches for the can of hi-caf Cola thats
sitting beside her

She takes a final swig then tosses the can in the waste
basket where it joins a number of other empties

Kristen rummages through the drawer in her nightstand and
grabs some cigarettes and matches She gets out of bed
crosses to the window and slides it open

She slumps into the chair beside the window and lights a
match by striking it against her thumbnail Very cool She
lights the cigarette and takes a deep drag

EXT ALICES HOUSE - NIGHT

Alice can be seen by the kitchen window A sliver of light
creeps out of the garage along with a THUMPING NOISE

INT GARAGE - NIGHT

Rick is involved in a series of interesting exercises Hes
kicking and sparring with a suspended bodybag doing martial
arts spins between returns He wears an oriental bandana
around his forehead

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Alice is standing at the sink in front of the kitchen window
finishing up a stack of dishes She looks up when headlights
sweep across her face

EXT ALICES HOUSE - NIGHT

ALICES POV

A car is swerving into the driveway It makes an awkward
approach and knocks over a garbage can thats positioned
well off to one side

INT GARAGE - NIGHT

Rick stops his exercises and steps away from the opening
electric door The car jerks into the garage and Johnson
climbs out As he walks uneasily to the house he takes a
quick nip from the bottle hes brought home Johnson becomes

self conscious when he sees his sone watching him

JOHNSON
First one of the day scouts honor

He shuffles by Rick
INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Johnson comes in and crosses to Alice Rick follows as far
as the doorway but holds his position there

JOHNSON

ALICE

RICK
But we gave up As usual

Alice takes a salad bowl out of the fridge and places it in
front of her father as he sits down at the table Johnson
stares at the salad in disbelief

JOHNSON
(disgusted)
You call this vegetation a meal after a
ten hour work day What the hell am I
A rabbit Christ Alice cant you try
to think a little more

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT (DAYDREAM)

Begin daydream Alice suddenly SMASHES the salad off the

daydreamer to wake up Its long

Johnson gets up and heads out

JOHNSON (contd)
Hell with this

JOHNSON (contd)

INT ALICES BEDROOM - NIGHT

Alice stands before a mirror that is virtually covered with
photos She seems lost in though and doesnt see Rick step
into the room

RICK

purpose

ALICE

ALICE

Alice takes a picture from the mirror an old black and white
of two little children herself and Rick much younger with a
woman A picture of happier times Crossing to sit on her
bed

ALICE (contd)
Do you ever wonder how things would be if
Mom were alive

RICK
(teasing)

ALICE

RICK

EXT JOEYS HOUSE - NIGHT
Establishing shot of house
INT JOEYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Posters of rock groups and girls line the walls The camera
pans them slowly tilting down past a particularly
provocative poster of a sexy bikinied babe CAMERA reaches
the LED display of a stereos VU meter which is hitting all
the red peaks But we can barely hear any music

The CAMERA FOLLOWS a headphone cord away from the stereo
passes some gorgeous pin-up POSTERS on the wall and then
finally reveals Joey stretched out on his waterbed He has
his TV hooked up to his stereo and is watching MTV which he
HEARS through the headphones

Theyre rocking out to a tune that spills out of his
headphones Hes also flipping through the latest issue of
Rolling Stone His eyes slowly shut

The magazine drops to his chest

ALL AT ONCE a rocking motion starts to make Joey rock back
and forth Something is causing waves within the waterbed
Joey snaps to He notices that the girl in the slutty poster
has vanished leaving only her photographed background Joey
has no time to be puzzled however as he rolls over and pulls
back the sheets on the bed

To Joeys surprise and delight a beautiful NAKED GIRL is
staring up at him from INSIDE HIS WATERBED

Not just any girl but the GIRL FROM THE POSTER Her hair is
floating around her face and shes pressing her body up
against the inside of the clear plastic Her voice cant be
heard but it looks like shes mouthing Joeys name

JOEY
What a great bed

Entranced Joey spreads his arms out over the girl and tires
to hug her Hes in heaven She starts to slowly drift away
from him DROPPING DOWN into the water until her features are
no longer clear

SUDDENLY the swimming figure bobs back up to the surface of
the bed But its no longer a beautiful girl ITS FREDDY
Our old pal smiles up at Joey and the blades of his knives
push against the surface of the vinyl mattress

Joey cries out but before he has time to react Freddys
arms rip up through the plastic and grab a hold of the boy
As water gushes all over Freddys demonic face pops up
behind him

FREDDY
Hows this for a wet dream

JOEY
Noooo Kristen Help

Freddy pulls Joey back down beneath the surface of the bed
and holds him under Joey thrashes but its hopeless

FREDDY (0S)
Two down One to go Hahahaha

CAMERA moves back around the room to the LED meter watching
as it dies down to nothing

INT KRISTENS BEDROOM - NIGHT
Kristen is sitting on her window seat finishing off another
cigarette She blows smoke out the window then uses the

butt to light a fresh cigarette

INT JOEYS BEDROOM NIGHT

Joeys MOTHER comes in to say goodnight

MOM
Joey are you asleep already Joey

She gets to the bed

MOM (contd)
Cmon give your mother a kiss

She pulls down the covers to reveal Joey in the bed She
screams

Joey is floating motionless INSIDE THE WATERBED His face
pressed up against the unbroken vinyl surface his hair is
billowing back in the still-swirling current and his eyes
are open in an eerie death stare

INT KRISTENS BEDROOM - NIGHT
A gentle breeze is blowing in the window and Kristen closes
her eyes for a few seconds as she lets the fresh air wash

across her tired face

Suddenly the wind dies away and the soft sound of the
tinkling chime ABRUPTLY STOPS Kristen opens her eyes and

stares out the window The night air is absolutely still

The leaves have stopped fluttering and the wind chime hangs
motionless in the tree

She hears someone calling her so she gets up and goes out
EXT FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

Kristen comes out and starts to walk slowly away from the
door She is listening to the FAINT SOUND that is wafting
through the air but she isnt really sure just what it is

As Kristen steps away from the house the CAMERA MOVES with
her in a CONTINUOUS SHOT So when she turns and heads back
the CAMERA is still following her And what Kristen sees
makes her scream

EXT ELM STREET HOUSE - NIGHT

Her home is now gone Standing in its place is the decaying
ELM STREET HOUSE Kristen spins around

INT WEIRD THIN SPACE BETWEEN WALLS WITH CHAIN CURTAIN

Shes in a long weird thin space between the walls She
passes through a chain curtain and moves further in the
corridor is filled with WAILING and STRANGE SOUNDS

INT WEIRD THIN SPACE BETWEEN WALLS WITH CHAIN CURTAIN

Kristen tries to navigate through the thin space She
SCREAMS and starts running as arms begin bursting out of the
sides of the corridor She ducks as they grab for her
Theyre Freddy-arms each one weilding his deadly claw

The arms force her down the next segment of the corridor As
she looks ahead she sees shes been led straight to Freddy
He LAUGHS

KRISTEN
I knew youd be back

FREDDY
And then there were none

Freddy charges towards her She turns and runs but suddenly
Freddy is right in front of her She stops cold and

concentrates

FREDDY
Elm Streets last brat
Freddy steps forward and raises his blades Hes about to
strike Trapped Kristen raises her hands in a final futile
attempt at self-defense

But before Freddy can swing his deadly blades down at her
Kristens outstretched arm suddenly BURSTS INTO FLAME She
screams and then we CUT TO

INT KRISTENS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Freddys last brat line ECHOES a few times before FADING
out as Kristen comes awake

Kristen jumps out of the chair as FLAMES shoot out of her
wastebasket Her cigarette has started a small fire She
grabs her can of soda and pours the rest out onto the fire
putting it out She nurtures a small burn on her hand

She turns to the window and cries out under her breath

KRISTEN
Joey Kincaid

EXT SCHOOL STEPS - MORNING

Its right before school starts the grounds are deserted
save for Kristen She sits alone on the steps rocking
herself slightly Shes looked better Shes nervous and
agitated

She reaches into her pocket and withdraws a cigarette She
takes out a match ignites it by striking it against her
thumbnail and lights the cig After a deep inhale she blows
smoke into the morning air

Alice appears

ALICE

Alices eyes

ALICE
My mom taught me when I was little Did

ALICE
No really its a fable The ‘guardian

Alice laughs

KRISTEN
I used to bring people into my dreams

Alice doesnt know what to make of this

ALICE

KRISTEN
When I used to have nightmares I

search party

INT BRYSONS CLASSROOM - DAY

A teacher a young hip man named BRYSON writes on the board
as the final stragglers come in Kristen and Alice enter
meeting Rick whos there already

Kristen takes on look at the roomful of STUDENTS and all the
blood drains from her face She isnt looking at the
students who are there She is staring at TWO EMPTY SEATS

Kristen starts to tremble a MURMURING begins deep inside her

and builds to a tortured CRY as she shakes her head no

Kristen starts to back away Her knees are getting weak
The other students are mesmerized by the outburst Some of
them are glancing over at the empty seats

RICK
What is it

KRISTEN
(screaming)
Oh God He killed them

Rick takes hold of her arm but shes really losing it now
and she pulls herself away from him with all her strength

The momentum of this violent move throws her off balance and
she falls back slamming against the door She strikes her
head slumps to the floor knocked out
INT SCHOOL NURSES OFFICE - DAY

A SCHOOL NURSE is passing an ampule of smelling salts under
Kristens nose She shakes her head then opens her eyes
The Nurse leans down over her and smiles

As Kristens sense of focus returns she looks up at the
Nurse with an expression of extreme urgency

KRISTEN

NURSE
You just stay put You need rest

KRISTEN
You dont get it hes after me

NURSE

The woman turns and sets down the smelling salts Her back
begins to bleed blood soaks through her white uniform

Everyone in the car has been leaning in towards Kristen
engrossed in her story Rick grows uncomfortable with the
crowding as if he had a strong aversion to tight spaces
which we would like to telegraph for later exploitation

RICK
Hey cmon Give me some room I hate
tight spaces

Those in the back seat back off Kristen speaks up

KRISTEN

Alice is staring at the house She suddenly speaks almost
to herself

Elaine impatiently HONKS the HORN again

KRISTEN

Rick leans in and gently kisses her
RICK

They are near the curb Alice stops as something on the
walkway catches her attention There are traces of a chalk
drawing on the concrete Alice bends down and runs a finger
across its surface

RICK (0S contd)
Alice

She looks up to Dan and Rick She starts to join them
Before she goes she turns and looks back down The drawing
is gone She stares at the walkway a beat before joining
Dan Rick and Debbie

INT KRISTENS DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Elaine is silently watching her daughter eat You could cut
the tension with a knife Finally Elaine speaks up

ELAINE
Something the matter with the cuisine

KRISTEN
Well Mom Ill tell ya when two of your
friends die the same day you let me know
what it does to your appetite

ELAINE
Youre just tired Dont think I havent
noticed your not sleeping That has to
stop honey

Kristen quickly stands but shes dizzy She grabs a hold of
the table to steady herself then sits back down again

KRISTEN
(concerned)
Whats wrong with me

ELAINE
Your distraught Itll help

Theres a straightened tone in her mothers voice that is
making Kristens eyes open wide Shes starting to
understand whats happening

KRISTEN
Oh GodNoWhatd you do

Kristen grabs her glass and pours the last of her milk out
onto the table Theres a grainy sediment remaining in the
bottom of the glass

When Kristen stands again shes unsteady on her feet She
tries to brace herself on the back of her chair with one
hand and when she does this she loses her grip on the empty
milk glass and it falls and shatters on the floor

With a wobbling gait Kristen lurches away from the table
Kristen stumbles around grabs her mothers purse and dumps
its contents on the counter Fumbling around she finds a
half-full container of prescription capsules She turns and
throws it at Elaine Pills fly everywhere

ELAINE
Im sorry honey but

KRISTEN
(screaming)
Sorry Sorry that you and your tennis
pals torched this guy whos now after me
In case you havent been keeping score

LAST COURSE

ELAINE

KRISTEN
Mother youve just murdered me Take

ON DESERTED BEACH

Wearing club med beach wear Kristen is lying on a towel ona
beach that runs along the edge of a broad lake The sun is
high and the sky is blue

KRISTEN (contd)
(softly to herself)
Thanks Alice

She slowly glances around the beach Down near the water a
LITTLE GIRL is building a SAND CASTLE

When the child turns and looks at her Kirsten sees that its
the same little girl that she saw drawing a picture on the
sidewalk

JUST OFF THE SHORE

The glassy surface of the water is unexpectedly broken by FIN-
LIKE OBJECTS that rise up and slice through the surf At
first it looks like a shark but as it gets closer we can
clearly see that it is FOUR BLADES in ascending height

ON THE BEACH

Kristen looks back at the Sand Castle but the little girl is
gone She does not notice the fins

MOVING WITH THE FINS
They turn and head straight for shore directly in line with

the Sand Castle and Kristen beyond it When they reach the
shore they continue straight on cutting THROUGH THE SAND
now instead of the water
ON THE BEACH

The knife-like fins move through the sand and enter the front
of the Elm Street Sand Castle At this point the sand
castle CHANGES INTO A SAND CASTLE OF THE ELM STREET HOUSE
then EXPLODES revealing

Freddy squinting against the harsh sunlight Freddy pops on
a pair of Ray-Bans He smiles as he steps forward and stands
over Kristen his backlit form is towering above her

FREDDY
Time to turn or else youll burn

Kristen is sunken halfway into the sand preventing escape

Freddy raises his claw as if to attack Kristen and the shadow
of the claw BURNS BLISTERS onto her otherwise pale skin

Freddy saunters over unaffected by the quicksand He
watches the girl struggle and laughs when her screaming mouth
fills with sand as she SINKS BELOW THE SURFACE

INT ELM STREET HOUSE - UPSIDE DOWN DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Kristen appears hanging upside down on all fours on the
ceiling of the room Shes disoriented She starts to get
some kind of bearing and starts crawling towards a wall

She makes it and struggles to reach a door She crawls down
the wall and manages to open the door She flings herself
through it

Kristen is horrified to discover that she is back in the
boiler room The place is really strange now Theres a fire
and steam all around

She realizes shes standing on a catwalk high above the room
She looks around and sees that Freddy is standing in front of
a furnace watching her with a grin on his face

With a defiant cry Kristen runs at Freddy She does a
series of cartwheels and throws herself at her tormentor

crashing into him

Caught off guard Freddy stumbles backwards and falls onto
the grating

FREDDY
Do it til ya dizzyhahahahaha

KRISTEN
We beat you before

FREDDY
But youre all alone
Freddy advances on the terrified girl
FREDDY (contd)
Hey Kristen Why dont you call in some
help

Freddy closes in Kristen struggles not to drag anyone in

KRISTEN
NeverIm the last

Freddys almost on top of her

FREDDY
Reach out and touch someone

Freddy raises his claw to slash Kristen She panics and ona
reflex calls for

KRISTEN
ALICE

Suddenly Alice comes crashing down ON TOP of them Kristen
is enraged

But Freddy is happy

FREDDY
How sweet Fresh meat

Kristen suddenly SLAPS Alice HARD across the face

KRISTEN
Come on Wake up and get OUT It was
a mistake oh God Im sorry

Nothing happens Kristen starts to back up taking Alice with
her Freddy pulls open his shirt and reveals the TORTURED
FACES of the souls of his previous victims

KRISTEN (contd)
(stepping forward)
Leave her alone

Freddy grabs Kristen and as Alice reacts in utter horror he
throws her into a nearby wall in which appears a burning sea
of flames

Kristen writhes as she burns

As the flames finish off the doomed girl a BLAST OF ENERGY
shoots out of the steaming furnace and slams into Freddy

His body crackles he arches his back and seems to grow as he
CONTORTS and PULSATES
FREDDY
NOW NO ONE SLEEPS AHHHH

He starts to advance on the terrified Alice As Kristen
roasts to a fiery death she calls out to Alice

KRISTEN
(pained)
Youll need my power

A second bolt of energy flies from Kristens body inside the
furnace and SLAMS into Alice causing her to glow and shake

Freddy closes in for the kill and is about to slice into
Alice

KRISTENS SMOLDERING FACE pushes out and emerges onto
Freddys chest

INT ALICES BEDROOM - NIGHT

Alice sits bolt upright in bed screaming She takes a few
breathes gets her bearings then walks towards her vanity
She stares at the mirror

One of the pictures on it is new Its a snapshot of a
beaming Freddy and a terrified Kristen down in the boiler
room Freddy smiles for the camera Alice stares at it
She turns it over

Theres an inscription on the back It reads FREDDY AND
KRISTEN HELL 1988 The picture suddenly BURSTS into flames
and disintegrates startling Alice She looks back at the
mirror The hole the picture has left on the reflective
surface allows Alice to see a portion of her face Her
reflection is subtly altered more enhanced

Rick bursts in

RICK
You alright

ALICE
(barely a whisper)
Kristen
She grabs him and pulls him out of the room

EXT KRISTENS HOUSE - STREET - NIGHT

Rick and Alice pull up to Kristens house and get out of
Ricks car

INT KRISTENS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Rick Alice and Elaine enter the room The bed is in a blaze
of FLAMES The last of Kristen is just a CHARRED ARM

EXT SCHOOL - DAY

Rick is sitting on a bench wearing dark sunglasses The
oriental bandana ties tightly around his forehead Hes in
mourning Seated around him are Alice whos dressed a bit
like Kristen Debbie and Dan Silence surrounds them Each
is respectful of Ricks mood

DAN
Hey man were all sorry

RICK
She knew she was gonna die

DEBBIE
You mean it was like suicide

Dan cuts in not letting Debbie finish her sentence

DAN
I thought it was an accident Smoking in
bed

ALICE

It was no suicide It was not an
accident It was Freddy and hes coming
back for seconds thirds and fourths

DEBBIE
Come on Freddys not real She couldnt
have been serious

DAN
I mean you cant really believe that

ALICE
I was there in the dream He took her
It was awful It was awful

DAN
In her dream

Alice gets up and abruptly walks away from the bench Rick
takes off his glasses and watches his sister go
RICK
Somethings very wrong here

DEBBIE
What

RICK
For a minute shewell reminded me of
Kristen

DAN

Werent they close
A beat

RICK
Not that close

INT GIRLS RESTROOM - DAY

Alice stares at her reflection for a few moments She studies
it She leans in real close to the mirrors surface

She takes out a cigarette sticks it in her mouth and lights
it by striking a match against her thumbnail eerily
reminiscent of Kristen

She takes a drag and COUGHS violently She quickly stamps it
out She looks into the mirror

ALICE
I dont smoke
(beat)
Kristen what did you do to me

Sheila enters the restroom heads for a faucet next to Alice
and immediately splashes her face with cold water Alice
watches her She gets a look at Sheilas tired face

SHEILA
Ohhhhbaby I am dead on my feet

ALICE
We have matching luggage

SHEILA
What

Again reminiscent of Kristen Alice points to a spot under
Sheilas eye

ALICE
Youve been up all night

SHEILA
That obvious huh
ALICE
Then you saw him too

SHEILA
Saw who I was up all night cramming for
this physics test and I was putting this
little baby together Look

Sheila reaches into her purse and withdraws a small neat
looking gadget not unlike a joy buzzer only this means
business She squeezes it and it emits a HIGH-PITCHED WHINE

SHEILA (contd)
You know how Debbies afraid of bugs I
made this for her Ultra high sound
waves Makes ‘em run screaming their
antenna off

Sheila collects herself and starts to leave

SHEILA (contd)
See ya in class

She exits leaving Alice alone in the rest room
INT PHYSICS CLASSROOM - DAY

The STUDENTS are sitting at their desks waiting for the
dreaded exam Sheila starts to wheeze a little but she
takes a hit off of her aspirator and that settles her down
She looks exhausted

While the TEACHER places test papers face down in front of
each of the students Sheila checks out her CLASSMATES
Alice and Rick are there and so is Dan

When the teacher finally gets to Sheila he drops the test in
front of her giving her a little slap on the back

The teacher glances up at the clock above the blackboard
then turns to the students

TEACHER
Alrightyou have forty minutes Good
luck and go to it

Test papers are turned over The examination has begun
Concentration scribbling thinking cheating satisfaction
and despair Its all there

Sheila is staring at her paper She holds her eyes open
wide They slowly shut for a second She recovers and
opens her eyes wide again She stares back at the paper
INT PHYSICS CLASSROOM - DAY (DREAM BEGINS)
ON THE TEST

The equations dance about on the page like acrobats Sheila
blinks in confusion yet they still move She takes a look
around All the other students are working including Alice

Sheilas pen is poised over her paper her eyes get heavy
her head droops forward but she again snaps to with a start

She shakes her head and looks down at her test Sheila puts
her pencil to paper and tries to fill in an answer but no
writing appears on the paper

Blinking again the equations on the page start to dance
Slowly the letters start to form words again They spell out
LEARNING IS FUN WITH FREDDY

Sheila shakes her head and looks around Then she looks down
at her page where a drop of blood splatters Her pen is
leaking blood

Alice awake turns and notices Sheilas troubles No one
else in the classroom reacts

Sheila tries to clean the blood with her hand making an even
bigger mess Then HER HAND PUSHES RIGHT INTO THE DESK She
struggles to free it but shes pulled even further

Suddenly she pulls it free looks around relieved The
tension mounts then suddenly a mechanical beastie type claw-
thing jumps out of the desk and grabs hold of Sheilas arm
She yells

Alice turns and sees Sheila struggling Alice starts to rise
when a bar shoots out across her lap and straps her in She
struggles to help Sheila But all the other students are
calmly involved in the test

Sheila looks forward at the teachers desk Freddy sits at
the table peeling an apple with a claw

FREDDY
Schools out

Finally Sheila pulls her arm free but the bar slips around
her waist entrapping her

Freddy heads down the aisle

Sheilas breathing all but stops She tries to scream but
can only choke and wheeze

FREDDY (contd)
Suck me sidewaysSave your breath
Freddy yanks Sheila to him and kisses her hard on the mouth
and begins to suck literally drawing the air from her lungs

The Freddy-created-vacuum is intense Sheilas ribs are
drawn into themselves and CRACK IN HALF Her body is
imploding as her insides life essence is sucked completely
dry

Young skin now cracked and peeling brown The rind you throw
away Freddy lets go of Sheilas shell and it drops to the
desk with a dusty THUD

FREDDY (contd)
Sorry you fail

Freddy turns to the terrified Alice He walks over
screeching his talons on the blackboard

INT PHYSICS CLASSROOM - DAY (BACK TO REALITY)

Suddenly Freddy is gone and Sheila is lying across her desk
choking for air while the teacher and students gather
around Alice fumbles with Sheilas inhalator forcing it
into her mouth but

Sheilas head just droops to one side Dead

Alice is suddenly hit by a JOLT She recovers after a shaky
moment

Sheilas home-made zapper falls out of one pocket and falls
on the floor Alice quickly scoops it up

Rick Dan and Debbie surround her Alice starts to freak

ALICE
Didnt you see it He was here

They all stare at her strangely Rick leads her carefully
from the classroom supporting her exhausted body The other
students file out

STUDENT
The test wasnt that bad

EXT SCHOOL - DAY

Schools been let out for the day and dozens of STUDENTS are
standing around the parking lot watching the paramedics lift
a nylon sheet-covered body into a waiting ambulance

Sheilas friends watch in silence as the vehicle pulls away
A BURP OF SIREN to part the crowd of teens

DEBBIE
(fighting tears)
Asthma attackwhat 17-year old has a
fatal asthma attack She was gonna be a
doctor

ALICE
It was Freddy

DEBBIE
Enough of that crap

ALICE
I saw it It was my dream I brought
Sheila in

A horrible realization dawns on Alice

ALICE (contd)
Oh God I brought her in like Kristen

Rick tries to help touches

RICK

Alice breaks free leaves

ALICE
No dont I gave Sheila to him and now

DAN

INT ALICES BEDROOM - NIGHT

Alice empties her pockets on her vanity table She comes up
with Sheilas gadget She begins to tinker with it she
hefts it sizes it up She sets it down and looks up at the
mirror

She hesitantly reaches out and pulls another photo off the
mirror revealing more of her reflection

Its a picture of her and Sheila she puts it down Alices
image is prettier stronger

She HEARS A NOISE from downstairs and leaves her room to
investigate

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT (DREAM)

Alice enters the kitchen
ALICE

Alice flicks on the lights She gasps Her father is
sitting at the table He looks up at her smiles warmly

JOHNSON

Alice shrugs

ALICE
Its not your fault

JOHNSON
Nah Ive been using that excuse since
your mother died

He crosses to the fridge opens the door and bends down to
take a look The door blocks Alices and our view of him

JOHNSON (contd)
But I promise honey Ill make things
better for you

The fridge door SLAMS shut revealing Johnson

JOHNSON (contd)
Now if I could only kick the habit

Hes holding an oversized martini glass His face looks like
the worst case of alcoholic deterioration Blood seeps from
burst blood vessels in his eyes his nose is red and lined
and warped

Hes wearing Freddys sweater He takes a swig off the huge
Vodka bottle He vomits up blood as he speaks

JOHNSON (contd)
(Freddys voice)
Wheres dinner

bursts in and hits the light

RICK

ALICE

picks it up

RICK

Edison This looks like Sheilas

ALICE

RICK

Kristen

Alice looks sympathetically at her brother

ALICE
I miss her too She gave me her ability
but I dont know how to use it I can

Alice looks straight at her brother

ALICE (contd)
Freddy lives in my dreams Rick Like he

RICK

ALICE

RICK
Then well stay up together
INT CRAVE INN - NIGHT

Alice is standing behind the diners counter Adding up the
nights receipts near the cash register Her waitress
uniform is spotted with stains evidence of a hard day

She finishes up the receipts and closes the cash register
She then pours coffee grounds into a cup of black coffee as
if it were sugar She stirs it halfheartedly and drinks it
down

Dan suddenly walks in and heads for the counter about to
place an order to go He sees that its Alice behind the
counter and is surprised

DAN
Hey how ya doin

Alice looks up From the look of her shes not doing that
well Dan is taken a bit aback by her appearance

DAN (contd)
Havent seen you around lately

ALICE
Ive been working double shifts

DAN

ALICE
Look you know why you just dont

Dan looks around and leans in to her
DAN
No offense or anything but its kind of
hard to swallow
ALICE

with
Alices eyes well up She begins to come unraveled
ALICE (contd)
I dont know what to do I cant stop
it Why doesnt he just kill me

DAN
How long have you been awake

ALICE

Dan lets this sink in Alice becomes embarrassed and self-
conscious under Dans scrutiny

ALICE (contd)
Dont you understand Every time I

DAN
Alright lets assume this whole thing is
true Why does Freddy all of a sudden
need you

ALICE
Kristen was the last child left of the
people who killed Freddy Maybe Freddy

Dan and Alice are both silent for a moment They look at
each other Dan reads the mix of emotions on Alices face
guilt shame anger exhaustion Hes about to say something
when a sudden voice calls out Dans date a pretty and
polished CHEERLEADER TYPE appears at the door

GIRL

Alice is struggling to stay awake in a back row of the class
At the front a typical high school lecturer drones on in

boring monotone

We hear the words from Alices point of view as they distort
as she gets closer and closer to falling asleep
LECTURER
Every society dating back to the
ancients has had theories regarding
dreams what they mean how to control
them Aristotle believed that during
sleep you soul roams free What it sees
are dreams Skilled dreamers control
what they see There is a theory that
there are two gates your soul can enter
one a positive gate the other a
negative The dreammaster guards the
positive gate and protects its sleeping
host There are fewer theories about the
negative gate

of the walls and the doors change

The elevator comes to sudden halt Rick is thrown to the
ground by the impact He gets up and looks around as the
door opens into

INT CHINESE LIVING AREA - DAY

A pristine clean Chinese room (a la living quarters in

He scans the room suspiciously then more calmly

Suddenly out of nowhere Rick is hurtled backward as if
kicked by an invisible opponent

RICK
What the

Freddys voice is heard

FREDDY (0S)
A true warrior Rick-san needs no eyes

Rick is kicked again and floored He stands now angry He
flails around at the air then is hit again

RICK
Come out and fight me you chicken shit

Freddys laugh is heard

FREDDY (0S)
Ninja warriors have calm Find your
balance Rick

Rick is hit again and thrown back against a screen which
breaks He stands up slowly with ultimate concentration He
turns quickly as if with radar Suddenly he kicks back at the
air and connects A resounding thump is heard He
progresses forward in a series of karate moves all of which
connect soundly and quickly with the invisible force

RICK
Too wimpy to show yourself Krueger
Well hows this for balance

With extra strength Rick kicks out in the air He connects
hard and suddenly Freddys glove appears out of thin air and
lands on the floor as if kicked off by Ricks power

Rick stops and stares at the glove on the ground He laughs
victoriously

RICK (contd)
Hahaha You superhero How you gonna
get me without your weapon Youre dead
meat

Rick looks down as Freddys laugh resounds through the room

of the diner

Suddenly the front doors are blown off their hinges and wind
picks up It whistles as the air becomes thick with dust and
debris

there are no customers to be seen A single WAITRESS is
standing behind the barren counter

Alice walks across to the counter and settles onto a stool
The waitress steps over and slides a tattered menu in front
of her Alice studies the woman for a moment Something
about her is familiar It makes the girl uneasy

In her sixties the waitress looks like shes worked every
day of her life Her hair is streaked with gray and there
are deep pockets under her eyes She seems to be the kind of
person whose life has passed her completely by

WAITRESS
Whatll it be

Alice doesnt answer

WAITRESS (contd)

Cmon honey I dont want to be here

Alice notes the waitress name badge ALICE

She walks over to the mirror on the vanity table Her eyes
travel over the tokens shes collected form her friends

She starts to power up She takes Sheilas gadget which
shes improved and hangs it around her neck She takes
Debbies studded bracelet and SNAPS it around her wrist

Lastly she takes Ricks oriental bandana and ties it like
Amazonian around her forearm She hoists the gun She likes
her reflection in the mirror Somethings very different
The pills are starting to take effect Alice grabs her
forehead

She looks back at the mirror Shes strong confidant ready
to accept her destiny

With forceful determination she tears the rest of the
pictures off her mirror What she sees makes her GASP

INT ALICES BEDROOM - NIGHT

ON THE REFLECTION
Its Alice alright but everythings turbo-charged Shes
leaner meaner her clothes are tighter more battle-like
Everythings accented The gadget around her neck is now a
super high-tech amulet The bracelet has spikes instead of
studs and seems to be made of shining titanium

This is no high school girl This is no dream warrior This
is the dream master ancient guardian of the gate of good

dreams Alice speaks to her reflection

ALICE
Now I lay me down to sleep

The reflection speaks back

ALICES REFLECTION
The master of dreams my soul Ill keep

ALICE
In the reflection of my minds eye

ALICES REFLECTION

ALICE

Alice looks at the shotgun which remains the same in the
reflection Next to her supernatural image it doesnt seem

an impressive weapon

ALICE (contd)
Save it for Rambo

She tosses the gun aside and notices the clock on her vanity
table Its 15 seconds to ten

INT OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

Suddenly Dan starts to choke

He opens his eyes and sees the doctor standing over him

ALICE

Alice and Dan turn around and run for the doors Just as
they get to them Freddy throws them open from the other
side

On instinct Dan leaps in front of Alice to confront Freddy
He grabs Dans fist holds his arms out and slashes Dan
Once twice across the chest Blood spurts but its only
superficial damage

Alice grabs the sharper of the the surgical instruments and
turns on Freddy

ALICE (contd)
I1l mail your guts back to hell

Alice starts to hurl the instruments at Freddy Kung Fu style
with blurring speed and accuracy Rick would be proud

Alice nails Freddy once a dozen times in the space of a few
seconds Freddy doubles over sharp instruments sticking out
of every part of him Alice advances on him and delivers a

massive sharp kick to Freddys balls Freddy makes a SOUND
that banshees would flee from
Alice grabs Dan and the two plunge through the doors
INT KALEIDOSCOPE HALLWAY - NIGHT

Dan and Alice run into the hallway But its no hallway
its a huge rotating cylinder It looks like a hallway but
its spinning Dan and Alice immediately become dizzy

At the end of the hallway theres a large wall-to-wall
sheet of colorful lights It gives the impression that Dan
and Alice are trapped within a huge kaleidoscope

They careen down the hallway and go crashing through the
colorful lights which turn out to be stained glass

Dan and Alice CRASH through a stained glass window without
the gurney and land with such tremendous force that even
after hitting the floor they dont stop They skid along the
floor out of control

Keeping Dans hand in one hand Alice reaches out and SLAMS
her spiked bracelet into the floor The spikes dig in and
serve as her break They SCREECH across the floor smoke
rises from the grooves they make Alice digs in deeper and
they manage to come to a stop in a pile of broken stained
glass

They stand up just as Freddy appears

FREDDY
Welcome to wonderland Alice Hahahaha

Dan leaps at Freddy Freddy slashes him across the chest
superficially but theres plenty of blood

ALICE

spurt wildly from his chest

TV then he starts to fade

DAN

She reaches for him but hes gone his echo remains for a
moment

INT RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT

Dans beginning to regain consciousness The doctor stands
over him

DOCTOR

Relax son It was rough but we pulled

you out
DAN

(urgent)

Put me back under Please Put me back
DOCTOR

What the hell Just a while ago you

were screaming not to be put under

DAN
Well I changed my mind

INT CHURCH - NIGHT

Alice crouches into a fighting position (a la Rick) as
Krueger advances finger-blades flashing

Alice leaps and delivers a perfect kick to Freddys face
knocking him back

Alice lands on her feet as Freddy lunges for her

Alice jumps over a church pew as Freddy slashes at the air

Alice whirls and kicks Freddy again and again and again
Just pounding him

But Freddy laughs at the blows

FREDDY
(contemptuous )
You think you got what it takes I been
guarding my gate forever hahaha

Freddy grabs Alice by the ankle and whirls her around like a
rag doll and tosses her away

Alice is thrown the length of the church and CRASHES into the
confessional booth splintered wood and cracking bones
Alice sinks heavy among the debris She doesnt move
Freddy advances on her Going in for the kill Just when
hes close enough Alice springs up She was playing possum

She reaches out and PUNCHES a hole in the wall behind the
debris of the confessional She pulls out several crackling
electric cables She looks bizarre and powerful framed for a
moment in the blue light of the sparkling electricity

She rips off the gadget from around her neck and aims it at
Freddy Freddy LAUGHS at her and it

Alice shoves on of the electric cables into the center of the
gadget It HUMS and BUILDS and GLOWS until a LOUD
incredibly powerful LASER BOLT shoots out of it and hits
Freddy square in the chest

A stunned Freddy looks at his mid-section Quite frankly
its missing Theres only a gaping smoking hole through
which Alice can see the rest of the church

Alice throws the smoking gadget and cable to the floor She
has no time to savor her temporary victory however

Freddys playing fill in the blanks with himself The
charred hole in his mid-section begins to fill in Ina
matter of seconds hes whole again

He laughs and starts to advance on Alice Frustrated she
grabs a huge cross which she handles easily then charges
him

Freddy raises the cross On one pass she tears open
Freddys sweater revealing the faces of the souls trapped
within Freddy She gags at the sight

Freddy seizes the moment and grabs the cross He tosses it
away

Freddy SMACKS Alice across the face He grabs the back of
her head and throws her over him across the church and into
the altar He advances on her

FREDDY (contd)
I am eternal

Alice is looking pretty bloody She tries to fend off Freddy
but he smashes her into the opposite wall She crumples in
pain beneath the broken stained glass window she came in
through

Freddys coming for her His tongue wiggling like a demented
Wile E Coyote about to grab the Road Runner

The kids in the choirs SING OUT
CHILDREN
For in the reflection of my minds eye

The sun rises behind the window the children are standing in
front of The light hits the wall and works its way to
Alice and the floor Freddy steps into it as he advances

ALICE
(remembering)
Let evil see itself

Alice looks down and sees a large piece of stained glass
She sees her reflection in it unbruised pretty the true
her She scoops it up and holds it in front of Freddy

The chorus of ghostly kids complete the rhyme with Alice

ALICE AND KIDS
And it SHALL DIE

Freddys about to slice into Alice he raises his arm

Light hits Freddy off the glass like a BLAST He looks at
Alice and sees himself reflected in the glass He SCREAMS

We PUSH IN on Freddys SCREAMING reflection right into his
mouth

INT FREDDYS BODY - NIGHT

We ZOOM down into Freddys innards which are made up of
struggling dead kids The souls all trapped and hanging
inside Freddys body start to break free as they SCREAM and
CRY

INT CHURCH - NIGHT

We travel through then emerge out of FREDDYS EYE We PULL
BACK to reveal that Freddys entire body is pulsing and
ripping from within

ALICE
LET THEM OUT

The trapped souls begin TEARING THROUGH FREDDYS BODY flesh
and blood erupting in all directions

Freddys sweater stretches and rips apart Freddy doubles
over as his HEAD BULGES All the tiny bodies inside him
surge upwards A tiny hand smashes through one eye

Finally Freddys head EXPLODES and the freed souls pour out
The force SHATTERS the glass in Alices hands She
straightens up and watches as the souls swoop around her
before ZOOMING out the broken window

ALICE (contd)
Youre dead

Alls quiet except for a steady wind that blows the shell of
Freddy Krueger and his hat down the church aisle

And out the door The double doors SLAM SHUT

INT CHURCH - NIGHT

Alice stands alone Shes no longer dressed like dream
master Having fulfilled her mission shes now just normal

Alice again but retains the newfound beauty and confidence

Alice stands frozen for a moment then regards her quiet
surroundings

ALICE
Rest in hell

DISSOLVE TO
EXT PARK - DAY
Dan and Alice are walking through the park arms around each
other From the look of their healing bruises its some

weeks later

FADE TO BLACK
