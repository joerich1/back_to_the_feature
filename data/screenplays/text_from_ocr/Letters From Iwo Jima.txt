INT IWO JIMA CAVE -— DAY 1

A dark but large cave in the depths of the Motoyama
Mountains of Iwo Jima The hand carved walls show
striations of pick axes from many years past

A PHOTOGRAPHER makes notes on his clipboard and takes
flash pictures of labeled artifacts laid out on the
floor -- a dust covered BOOT a rusted and dented
CANTEEN

A group of JAPANESE EXCAVATORS wearing hard hats with the
words “Association of Iwo Jima” emblazoned on them
carefully dig the floor with shovels

The dirt is thrown into wooden boxes with rhythmic
THUMPS and carried out to be sifted

Drenched with sweat and their faces red with exertion
the excavators wither under the humid heat

EXCAVATOR 1
How did those soldiers dig out
these tunnels in the first place
Exhausted Excavator 1 has to pause

EXCAVATOR 1
Lets get a rotation in here

He starts to leave

EXCAVATOR 2
Wait a minute

His shovel hits something which looks like a LEATHER
SATCHEL

The two Excavators take a closer look and carefully dig
around the artifact

EXT IWO- JIMA BEACH - CLOSE ON VARIOUS SHOVELS - DAY
(JUNE 1944)

as they pierce the black sandy dirt of the beach They
dig in and lift

The voice of PVT KATSUHIRO SAIGO in his thirties reads
a letter

2

SAIGO (V0)
To Hanakg We soldiers dig We
dig all day We dig holes where we
are to stand when battle comes
Holes just big enough to stand in
Not wide enough to move forward or
to move back Holes where we are
expected to fight and stay in
until we die for die we most
likely will

PULL BACK TO REVEAL —-

An entire beach lined with trenches and SOLDIERS digging
The sun beats down on their sweat-drenched backs

SUPERIMPOSE IWO JIMA ISLAND JUNE 1944

Other soldiers maneuver artillery pieces into position or
work on constructing bunkers and pillboxes -- buried huts
for housing machine guns and antitank weapons

SAIGO (V0)
Hanako now I know what it feels
like to dig my own grave

Saigo wipes his face dirtied with the black sand He has
an unrefined look but with kind eyes and an energetic
demeanor He’s seen enough in life to either make him
wise or a wise-ass

A FLAG of the Japanese Navy and Army bearing the sun motif
with banded rays flutters on the beach encampment

Overhead a PLANE approaches the island

INT PLANE HEADED TOWARDS IWO - DAY 3

LT GENERAL TADAMICHI KURIBAYASHI fifty-three staunch
and tall with an air of regality sits on a bench of the
supply plane

KURIBAYASHI (V0)
Today I head for my post where my
men are stationed To avoid
detection by the enemy I take a
supply plane and the hour of my
arrival remains unannounced My
heart is as strong as that of
General Kusonoki who gave his life
for Japan 650 years ago at the
Minato River

Kuribayashi looks out a window as the plane descends
e

KURIBAYASHI (V0)

I hope you and the children are
well I’m sorry I wasn’t able to
attend to the kitchen floor before
I left Make sure to have Taro
take care of it as those drafts
may give you a cold

As the plane approaches Iwo Jima the island materializes
below like a large brown pork chop The distinct dome-

shaped volcano Mt Suribachi rises up out of the South

end

EXT BACK ON IWO JIMA BEACH 4

The black-sanded beach is busy with the activity of
soldiers

The men dig at different intervals from one another
PVT KASHIWARA digs in the hole next to Saigo’s

SAIGO
Damn this island The Americans
can have it

He continues digging as he mutters

SAIGO
Nothing grows here it smells
it’s hot there are too many damn
bugs and there’s no water

KASHTIWARA
This island is part of Japan’s
sacred homeland

SAIGO
There’s nothing sacred about this
island

CAPTAIN TANIDA late twenties and sharply dressed walks
along the trenches inspecting Kashiwara sees him and
tries to warn Saigo

KASHIWARA
Hey Saigo Hey

Saigo ignores Kashiwara as he continues grumbling

SAIGO
We should just give this island to
the Ameritans and then we can go
home

CAPTAIN TANIDA
What did you say soldier

Saigo finally sees the Captain and puts his shovel down

‘Salutes

SAIGO
Sir I said if we beat the
Americans then we can go home

Captain Tanida looks at Kashiwara

CAPTAIN TANIDA
You there Is that what he said

Kashiwara seems helpless There is a moment of
hesitation

KASHIWARA
Yes sir

EXT AIRSTRIP - DAY

ADMIRAL OHSUGI forties waits patiently on the beach
along with his OFFICER STAFF MEMBERS

Finally the war-torn plane drones in for a landing It
lands safely on the landing strip

Kuribayashi steps off onto the tarmac LT FUJITA
twenties Kuribayashi’s personal aide follows behind
hin

They makes their way to Ohsugi and exchange salutes
ADMIRAL OHSUGI

Welcome General Kuribayashi I’m
Admiral Ohsugi

They bow politely

KURIBAYASHT
How long have you been waiting
here for me

Ohsugi checks his watch

ADMIRAL OHSUGI
Three hours sér

KURIBAYASHI
Sorry to hear They wouldn’t
allow me to wire my arrival after
what happened to Admiral Yamamoto

ADMIRAL OHSUGT
I understand sir

Kuribayashi turns to Lt Fujita

KURIBAYASHI
This is my aide Lieutenant
Fujita

Admiral Ohsugi and Lt Fujita bow to each other
Ohsugi touches his stomach and grimaces

KURIBAYASHI
What’s the matter Admiral You
don’t look very well

ADMIRAL OHSUGI
Oh it’s nothing sir The water
here does not agree with me

KURIBAYASHI
Sorry to hear that

Ohsugi motions the way

ADMIRAL OHSUGI
This way to your quarters

KURIBAYASHI -
Admiral I want to make a round of
the island first

ADMIRAL OHSUGI
Shall I fetch a jeep

KURIBAYASHI
No lets walk Walking’s good
for the health It might be just
what you need Ohsugi

He chuckles but Ohsugi does not look pleased

They walk together while the members of the staff walk a
respectful 3 paces’ behind

Kuribayashi stops in front of a view of the cone-shaped
volcano MT SURIBACHI on the South end of the island
oS

KURIBAYASHI
I could see it from the plane
Mt Suribachi That’s the first
place the Americans will want to
take Ohsugi

BACK AT THE BEACH

Captain Tanida quickly finds a stick and whips Saigo and
Kashiwara with it The two grimace with the pain

Tanida doesn’t notice when Kuribayashi and his entourage
pass by behind him

CAPTAIN TANIDA
You no good peasants Scums

Kuribayashi approaches Captain Tanida who immediately
stands at attention and stops beating Saigo and
Kashiwara

KURIBAYASHI
Captain what are you doing

CAPTAIN TANIDA
These soldiers were conspiring
with unpatriotic words sir

Kuribayashi looks over at the haggard looking soldiers

KURIBAYASHT
I see And Captain do you have
such an excess of soldiers that
you can put two of them out of
commission

Captain Tanida is hesitant

CAPTAIN TANIDA
No sir

KURIBAYASHI
Then stop beating them Deny their
lunch rations instead

Ohsugi and Tanida look at each other miffed
KURIBAYASHT

A good captain uses his brain not
just his whip

6

CAPTAIN TANIDA
Yes sir ’

KURIBAYASHT
And what is all this

CAPTAIN TANIDA
This Trenches sir

i KURIBAYASHT
Why are the men digging trenches
here

Tanida looks to Ohsugi once again for support

CAPTAIN TANIDA
This is where the Americans are
expected to land sir

Kuribayashi looks at the men digging

KURIBAYASHI
Have them stop immediately

CAPTAIN TANIDA
But sir

KURIBAYASHI
If you had studied Tarawa you
would know that concentrating our
defenses at the beach would be
futile

Captain Tanida is hesitant Kuribayashi gives him a firm
look Captain Tanida turns towards the soldiers

CAPTAIN TANIDA
Stop digging

The men stop and look up surprised
Kuribayashi turns to Captain Tanida
KURIBAYASHI

And Captain make sure these men

get proper breaks They look like

they’re from Mars
EXT ALONG TRENCHES — LATER
The soldiers sit on the sand eating out of their mess

kits All except Saigo and Kashiwara who watch them
hungrily

Kashiwara rubs his stomach

- “© KASHTWARA
Just aS well My stomach’s been
bothering me anyway

A soldier on water duty comes by with a pitcher and they
are allowed a tiny cupful which they take gratefully

SAIGO
A toast to General Kuribayashi A
fine commander

Kashiwara drinks as well

SAIGO
Mmmmm Better than sake

PVT NOZAKI another soldier in his thirties comes to
join them

NOZAKI
I heard he lived in America Maybe
thats why he doesn’t want us
digging trenches Maybe he likes
the Americans

SAIGO
No stupid He studied the
Americans so now he knows how to
beat them

NOZAKT
I heard from someone in the 204th
that another general was supposed
to command the island but he
didn’t want the job so Premier
Tojo gave it to Kuribayashi
instead

SAIGO
You hear a lot of things Nozaki
but your ears are full of wax

Nozaki brushes him off

SAIGO
Anyway you can’t trust anyone
from the 204th They’re part of
the Navy I think this Kuribayashi
must be a superb general Look
were not digging those damn
trenches in the sand anymore are
we

ADMIRAL OHSUGI
41 Zekes and 13 bombers

KURIBAYASHT
Is that all

ADMIRAL OHSUGI
We sent 66 planes to reinforce the
fleet at Saipan

Kuribayashi looks grave

KURIBAYASHI
We will have to rely on support
from the Combined Fleet

He turns his attention to defense maps

KURIBAYASHI
These are your defense plans

ADMIRAL OHSUGI
Yes sir

KURIBAYASHI
And what about the army troops
Where will they be stationed

Ohsugi hesitates

ADMIRAL OHSUGI

You haven’t coordinated your
plans

ADMIRAL OHSUGI
Col Adachi prefers that we do not
interferewith each-other’s chain
of command

KURIBAYASHI
This is no time for childish
games Admiral This is war

Ohsugi feels the sting
Kuribayashi sighs and goes back to looking at the map
KURIBAYASHT
This will not work You are
concentrating all your efforts on
the beaches Move the artillery to
higher ground
LT ITO
But sir we just had them moved
down to the beaches

A BICYCLIST rides through the main street ringing his
bell

Captain Iwasaki yells at the Bicyclist as he passes them
by

CAPTAIN IWASAKI
You there

The Bicyclist halts

CAPTAIN IWASAKI
You should not be riding right in
the middle of the street like
that What if there were an air
raid or a military convoy coming
through here

The Bicyclist looks frightened He bows in compliance

BICYCLIST
I’m very sorry sir

CAPTAIN IWASAKI

The Bicyclist complies Officer Iwasaki turns to
Shimizu

CAPTAIN IWASAKI
Remember Shimizu as Kempeitai

- CAPTAIN IWASAKI
Be quiet

The Journalist stands up

JOURNALIST

He takes out his wallet and lays out his cash on the
table Shimizu looks at the cash disgusted

SHIMIZU
Do you think we can be bribed
How dare you insult us

14

CAPPAIN IWASAKI
Shimizu Ill find the articles

Shimizu nods in compliance and strong-arms the

their turn at hitting a bulls-eye

Kuribayashi stands watching from a distance

Another is slow to aim

CAPTAIN TANIDA
Faster

16

Kuribayashi continues to watch disappointment
registering on his face
nn

When it’s Saigo’s turn he aims his rifle At the last
minute he jerks his gun His shot is way off the mark

Captain Tanida storms up to him and shouts in his ear

CAPTAIN TANIDA
Saigo are you blind Cant you
see the target Even my 6 year
old could shoot better than you
do

Saigo bows his head in apology

CAPTAIN TANIDA
Do it again

Saigo fumbles He aims his rifle and once again his
shot is way off the mark

Captain Tanida hits the back of his head

CAPTAIN TANIDA
Youre an embarrassment -You’re a
poor excuse for a soldier
Tonight you will clean the boots
of your entire troop Go to the
rear

Kuribayashi turns to Lt Fujita

KURIBAYASHI
Better they should learn to clean
their guns properly rather than
their boots

EXT MOTOYAMA VILLAGE - DAY W7

General Kuribayashi with a company of army soldiers
marches through the local village Ever his shadow Lt
Fujita marches alongside him

It’s a small town with a dusty main street a bar
general store and single-story houses bedecked with
banners

Children women and grandparents run out to greet the men
with Rising Sun flags and cheer them on

Kuribayashi notices-a collection of idle TANKS in the
village with a few ARMY MECHANICS working on them

17

KURIBAYASHI
What are thosetanks doing here

LT FUJITA
Those are out of commission sir
They are waiting for parts

KURIBAYASHI

picture of a car America is
filled with cars I have to be

direction Even my maid has a
car Japan has a lot of catching

LT FUJITA
Yes sir
EXT CAMPGROUNDS -— NIGHT 20

Saigo is busy cleaning stacks of shoes Kashiwara
approaches him with his own boots

KASHIWARA
Saigo I know that you must be a
better shot than that after a year
and a half

all been taken down turning the city from colorful to
monochromatic

Only bits of litter remain scattering in the wind

Saigo and other members of his troop tear down a school
house collecting the wood into piles

Captain Tanida inspects another nearby structure

CAPTAIN TANIDA
We can use the wood from this one
as well

All the men stop when they hear the sound of a GALLOPING
HORSE They turn to see BARON TAKEICHI NISHI tall
handsome and gallant riding with gusto towards them

SAIGO (V0)

Hanako we have a celebrity in our
midst Do you remember Baron
Nishi the Olympic gold medalist
in horse jumping He has just
arrived from Tokyo and is
stationed here as Commander of the
26th Tank Regiment

The men watch as he rides full speed and hurdles over a
-fence A study in grace-and agility

The men CLAP Baron Nishi smiles and salutes them as he
rides on

CAPTAIN TANIDA
Get back to work men

Baron Nishi nearly mows Captain Tanida over as he gallops
away

SAIGO (VO)
Lieutenant Colonel Nishi is very
handsome so Im sure the rumors
of his womanizing skills must be
true but there are no women left
on the island to woo He is
friendly with the troops and
sometimes talks casually among
them Strange for a Lieutenant

SOUND CROSSOVER TO

EXT IWO JIMA BEACHES - DAY 24

Kuribayashi walks along the sand with his walking stick
He stops when he sees Baron Nishi approaching sand
flying from his horses heels

24 24

Baron Nishi dismounts his horse his spurred boots
CLINKING as they hit the ground He salutes Kuribayashi

General Kuribayashi walks up to Baron Nishi and they
shake hands like Westerners

KURIBAYASHI
Lieutenant Colonel Nishi I used
to be a cavalryman myself you
know

BARON NISHI
Yes of course I’ve been looking
forward to serving under you One
who understands horses the way I
do

KURIBAYASHI
Those were the days when soldiers
could ride in on horses Not
these mechanized contraptions

Kuribayashi admires the horse

BARON NISHT
I could send for another horse and
we could ride together General

KURIBAYASHT
I’m afraid my riding days are
over Nishi But tell me about
this famous horse of yours that
you won the Olympics with

BARON NISHI
My stallion Uranus

» He pulls out a picture of Dranus a stallion of Anglo-
F Norman stock and shows it to Kuribayashi

KURIBAYASHI
PThat’s a fine horse

BARON NISHI
The Italians thought I was doing
them a favor getting rid of him
to me No one could tame the
beast but I told them If that’s
a really headstrong horse it’s
just the one for me a headstrong
Tan’

They share a laugh

24 24

KURIBAYASHI
I’m dying for some news from the
mainland on the war effort We
mostly just hear what they filter
on the radio broadcasts

BARON NISHI
I understand It’s hard to know
what’s really going on these days

KURIBAYASHI
Dine with me tonight And if you
have brought any sake back with
you that would be a double
welcome

BARON NISHI
I think that can be arranged sir

25 INT OFFICERS QUARTERS - NIGHT 25

Kuribayashi and Baron Nishi sit at a table with cups of
sake before them

The COOK enters and serves them plates of fish and rice
He then continues to place empty plates on the table

KURIBAYASHI
Is that still really necessary

COOK
Regulations sir

Baron Nishi looks at Kuribayashi questioningly

KURIBAYASHI
I have told our cook that all
officers will have the same
rations and food as our men

The Cook looks flustered

COOK —
It is not right Officers should
not eat the same food

KURIBAYASHI
Apparently military regulations
dictates that officers must be
served at least three dishes

25

COOK
That’s right At least three
dishes This is a travesty sir
I am very ashamed

The Cook finishes placing the empty dishes

KURIBAYASHT
So as a compromise I told him he
could bring out empty dishes

The Cook bows and exits

KURIBYASHI
He’s a stubborn son of a bitch I
had to give in to him

Kuribayashi and Nishi LAUGH Kuribayashi jovially pours
another cup of sake in Baron Nishi’s cup

KURIBAYASHI
We will defeat the enemy this
time Nishi It will be different
from past island battles

BARON NISHI
I’m sure it will be sir

KURIBAYASHI
After all Iwo Tou is part of
Japanese soil

Kuribayashi sips his sake

KURIBAYASHI
When the enemy arrive we will
contain them and then our
Combined Fleet will take them out
Blast them back to America

Baron Nishi turns grave and is silent for a moment

BARON NISHI
General there is no longer any
Combined Fleet

KURIBAYASHI
What do you mean

BARON NISHI
I guess you haven’t heard about
what happened with Operation A-Go
ten days ago

(MORE) 25
BARON NISHI (contd)

Most of Admiral Ozawa’s carrier

planes and float planes were

destroyed off the Marianas We

still have some scattered naval

forces but theré will be no

striking power from the air or

sea for that matter

Kuribayashi looks dark then laughs

KURIBAYASHI
You must be drunk This island is
under the jurisdiction of the city
of Tokyo We’ll get our support

BARON NISHI
If you want my honest opinion the
best thing to do would be to sink
this island to the bottom of the
sea

Baron Nishi takes a large gulp of the sake Kuribayashi
is speechless his jovial mood wiped out

KURIBAYASHI
And yet you still came

BARON NISHI
Well I figured your men were
going to need all the tanks I
could bring

This brings a light smile back

INT PLANNING ROOM - NIGHT 26

Kuribayashi looks over the strategic plans He slowly
removes all air attack force plans from the table model
He stands over the table in grave contemplation then
angrily pulls strategic PLAN PAPERS off the wall

EXT IWO JIMA BEACH - DAY 27
Kuribayashi strides along the beach with Fujita behind
him

KURIBAYASHL
This beach is wide Yes the
enemy must land here They have
no alternative

Kuribayashi rushes the beach Fujita watches him

perplexed

SORE

27
KURIBAYASHI
Fujita

LT FUJITA
Sir
KURIBAYASHI
Run along the beach there
LT FUJITA
sir
KURIBAYASHI

Like you’re one of the Americans
Go on Which direction would you
take

Fujita contemplates for a minute then rushes up towards
the airfield

Kuribayashi quickly takes up a position and aims his
walking stick at Fujita pretending to shoot moves
around looks for another vantage point

He looks at the surroundings measuring where the best
positions would be

KURIBAYASHI
Okay come from the other side

Fujita complies Kuribayashi takes up another position
and mock shoots him again

EXT SLOPES OF SURIBACHI DAY 28
Kashiwaraand Saigo stare in awe at the beach activity

KASHIWARA
I think your general is a bit
nuts

Captain Tanida strides up the slopes barking commands

CAPTAIN TANIDA
Break time is over Back to work

The men get up immediately Kashiwara suddenly bowls
over from a cramp Saigo looks at him concerned

SAIGO
You don’t look so good Are you
all right

28

KASHIWARA
It’s fine UOgt the damn water
I’m sure But I really need to

go

He quickly makes his way to a discrete location behind
the mountain

EXT MOTOYAMA HILLS - DAY 29

Kuribayashi walks along the hillside with a gaggle of
Officers struggling to keep up with him

Admiral Ohsugi aging 57-yéar-old COLONEL ADACHI and MAJ
GENERAL SATO are among them

Finally Kuribayashi comes to a stop and turns to the
officers

KURIBAYASHI
Our strategy will be to take a
defensive position and use the
terrain to our advantage We will
build caves and tunnels in the
mountains place our artillery
along this ridge and Suribachi

COL ADACHT
What about the beaches

KURIBAYASHI
The men will have a clear view of
the beaches from Suribachi and
Motoyama There is no need to
fortify the beaches

GENERAL SATO
General Kuribayashi you must
understand that the trenches are
the first line of defense We must
resume work on the beaches

KURIBAYASHI

General do you know how many cars
America produces in a year Five
million Pive million cars
General The American forces and
their technological advancements
should not be underestimated The
Americans will cross the beaches
eventually and the soldiers’ lives
will be needlessly wasted there

29 29

COL ADACHT
It’s inevitable that men will die
But I’ve never heard of an island
operation without a line of
defense at the beaches

KURIBAYASHT
And how long did our guns last
along the beaches at Saipan and
Guam Will you please show me
just how effective the beach
pillboxes at Tarawa were

The officers are silent for a moment

GENERAL SATO
So we build tunnels and caves in
the mountains

ADMIRAL OHSUGI
It will be a futile waste of time
The men cannot dig through a
mountain Besides what kind of
war is fought in caves

GENERAL SATO
The strategy should be to force
the ships in for a heavy air
attack

ADMIRAL OHSUGI
I agree That makes the most
sense We will have support from
our Combined Fleet

Kuribayashi is quiet for a beat

- KURIBAYASHT
We can no longer count on our
Combined Fleet

ADMIRAL OHSUGI
What do you mean
KURIBAYASHI
The Combined Fleet has been
broken

The officers look at each other with gravity 29

KURIBAYASHT
Whats more “Iereceived an order
on the wire this morning that all
our remaining planés are to be
sent back to Tokyo to defend the
mainland

GENERAL SATO
We wont be able to last five days
without air support

KURIBAYASHT
We will hold the island as long as
possible no matter the outcome
Once the Americans take Iwo Tou
they will have a clear route for
their bombing runs But if we can
draw out the battle hold this
island for at least 20 days the
Americans will think twice about
attacking Japan

EXT RAIN COLLECTION SITE DAY 30

RAIN comes down in torrents a tropical storm in the
midst of the heat

Tarps that have been put up to collect the water fill up
with the rain

Soldiers transfer the water from the tarp into buckets
and haul them to camp

EXT IWO JIMA AIRSTRIP DAY 31
Another rainy day on the island
SUPERIMPOSE DECEMBER 1944

Shimizu steps off an air carrier along with other
soldiers He looks around him carrying his pack

SHIMIZU (V0)
To mother today I am to join my
new unit I know you have been
wondering about my transfer This
is something I cannot discuss now
but I will explain to you some
day

INT TROOP’S CAVE DAY (DEC 1944)

The soldiers lie on their bedrolls reading books

writing letters or mending their uniforms Even though
it’s winter the men are stripped to their undershirts

and try to fan themselves in the heat

Saigo reads a BOOK with pictures of Egypt on the cover

Saigo shows Nozaki a page from the book

SAIGO
Look at this picture

NOZAKI
That’s some fancy castle

SAIGO
You know who that castle was made
for Somebody who was already
dead

NOZAKI
They must have had a lot of money
back then to make a castle like
that for a dead person Why are
you reading a book about Egypt
anyway We’re never going to war
over there

SAIGO
(ignoring)
Well be lucky if we even get a
hole in the ground when we’re

dead

NOZAKI
Dont talk about that It’s bad
luck

Shimizu enters the cave Despite the rain his uniform

still looks crisp and clean

NOZAKI
Here comes the new recruit

SHIMIZU
Is this the 312th

SAIGO
That’s right

Saigo continues reading his book

32
NOZAKI -
I’m Nozaki This is Saigo
SHIMIZU
Shimizu Yoichi
NOZAKI
You can put your bedroll there

Shimizu

He points to an empty space Shimizu is about to put his
bedroll down but Saigo tries to prevent him

SAIGO
Theres another empty space at the
back end of the cave

NOZAKI
(to Shimizu)
Don’t mind him His friend
Kashiwara just died That used to
be his spot

Shimizu methodically puts his bedroll out where
Kashiwara’s spot used to be

SAIGO
But we are all going to die
That’s our plan isn’t it

SHIMIZU
If it serves the country it is a
death of honor

SAIGO
Kashiwara died of honorable
dysentery
NOZAKI

Where are you from Shimizu

SHIMIZU
From Kanagawa-ken

NOZAKI
Kanagawa-ken Ozawa is from there
aren’t you

OZAWA a young soldier in his twenties nods his head

OZAWA
Thats right Where did you
train Maybe we were at the same
camp

pais

etre - 32

Shimizu is hesitant

— samrzu
No I trained in Tokyo

NOZAKI
I trained in Tokyo too What
camp was it

Shimizu is hesitant again

SHIMIZU
The Koho Kimmu Yoin Yoseijo

Everyone becomes silent Shimizu turns to continue
unpacking his bedroll

Nozaki quickly leaves his vicinity and sidles up to
Saigo

NOZAKI
Why do you think they put a
Kempeitai in our unit

SAIGO
Hes not wearing the white arm
band He’s not Kempeitai

NOZAKT
He went to the Kempeitai military
academy

SAIGO

Maybe he flunked out
Nozaki notices a holstered PISTOL on Shimizu’s belt

NOZAKT
He acts like a Kempeitai And
look at his holster That’s not
standard issue And are riflemen
even supposed to have pistols
He’s been put here to spy on us

SAIGO
Why would he spy on us

NOZAKI
Maybe it’s those letters youve
been writing I think you should
be careful what you say Saigo 32

Saigo looks worried They watch Shimizu He sits down
and pulls out a small mixror checks his closely cropped
hair He jumps up suddenly with a YELL

A CENTIPEDE crawls on him

Nozaki and Saigo try to suppress their smirks

Shimizu looks embarrassed He stomps on the insect
angrily

EXT CAMPGROUNDS - DAY 33

The soldiers line up for their lunchtime rations They

each get a bowl of soup with weeds floating in them

SAIGO
Weed soup again

They look over towards Shimizu who stands behind them in
line

NOZAKI
Kuribayashi’s conserving our food
supplies for the battle

Saigo and Nozaki sit down

Shimizu sits slightly apart from the rest of the men He
looks at his soup trying to suppress his shock He digs
in and eats without comment

Saigo looks at Shimizu and then back into his soup

SAIGO
Well be dead before the Americans
even get here And you would
think with all my war effort
contributions we should be eating
kasutera cakes or sandwiches

NOZAKI
What

SAIGO
I ran a bakery shop in Tokyo with
my wife We sold kasutera and
ampan cakes back when we could
still get sugar

Saigo motions towards Shimizu

33

SAIGO
His kempeitai brethren used to
come in and take what they wanted
Said it was for the war effort

NOZAKI
We ran in to those types at our
clothing store as well

SAIGO

When we started making sandwiches
they took those too And when we
ran out of meat and just had
bread they still came Finally
they took our baking equipment for
themetal and we were out of
business

(a beat)
I should have been a fisherman

NOZAKI
It must be hard on your wife
without the shop and without a
husband

Hanako brightens when she hears this

END OF FLASHBACK

EXT MOTOYAMA CAVES -— DAY 36

The sound of PICK AXES CLANGING against STONE WALLS

emanates from a complex network of multilevel caves and
tunnels in the Motoyama mountainside

36

Saigo Nozaki and Shimizu work -in a separate area where
sulfurous HOT STEAM risegfrom the rocks They wear GAS
MASKS to protect themselves

The mountain is like a busy anthill where men dig
remove cart and carry

Baron Nishi still wearing his spurred boots directs his
men on camouflaging tanks in gunner positions

“Kuribayashi looks at his plans comparing the work to his

map

He remains unnoticed by Admiral Ohsugi and Lt Ito as he
walks behind them

ADMIRAL OHSUGI
This is ridiculous Why waste
time digging these impossible
caves when they are all going to
die anyway

LT ITO
At least he has conceded to the
pillboxes on the beaches

Kuribayashi continues to walk on

INT OFFICER’S QUARTERS - NIGHT 37

General Kuribayashi sits at his desk writing a memo
Admiral Ohsugi enters

ADMIRAL OHSUGI
You wanted to see me sir

KURIBAYASHT
Yes Admiral

Kuribayashi continues writing and Admiral Ohsugi has to
wait patiently Finally Kuribayashi looks up

KURIBAYASHI
Admiral Ohsugi you have been
looking quite pale these days

ADMIRAL OHSUGI
‘It’s the water It has never
agreed with me

KURIBAYASHT
I think you need to go back to
Tokyo to recoup

Kuribayashi hands him the memo

Admiral Ohsugi look at it and is momentarily speechless

KURIBAYASHI
I have just commissioned Admiral
Ichimaru to take your place

-ADMIRAL OHSUGI
General the island won’t last
more than five days without fleet
support Im not alone in
thinking the cave work is
futile

Kuribayashi stands up from the table angered

KURIBAYASHI
The cave digging may be futile
Maybe the stand on Iwo Tou will be
futile Maybe the whole war is
futile But will you give up
then What will we tell the
people of Japan Admiral Ohsugi
we will stay and hold this island
until we die until every last
breath of us is expired If my
children can live to see one more
day of a free Japan that would be
worth the one more day that we
suffer instead of surrender So
don’t tell me that the cave work
is futile

He sits back down Admiral Ohsugi looks defeated
ADMIRAL OHSUGI
Im sorry General I was
mistaken

KURIBAYASHI
You are dismissed

Admiral Ohsugi turns and walks out

EXT HORSE PEN - DAY

Fresh from a ride Baron Nishi fondly brushes his horses

coat

BARON NISHI

EXT CAMPGROUND - DAY 7 39
Admiral Ohsugi walks in the direction of the airstrip
Behind him his AIDE follows carrying his bags

General Sato sees him on the way They stop and salute
each other

GENERAL SATO
Its true then I didn’t believe
it when I heard

Admiral Ohsugi tries not to show his humiliation

ADMIRAL OHSUGI
I’m glad to be gone from this
island

GENERAL SATO
We may have had our differences
but I’m truly sorry to seé you go

Admiral Ohsugi starts on his way again then stops

ADMIRAL OHSUGI
General Sato it’s up to you now
I hate to say it but Kuribayashi
belongs back behind a desk at the
Imperial Palace not commanding a
war

Baron Nishi emerges from the horse pen and overhears the
two talking

General Sato nods

GENERAL SATO
I understand There are many of
us whose sentiments are with you

Ohsugi continues on

EXT OUTDOOR INSTRUCTIONAL HUT - DAY 40

Saigo Shimizu and Nozaki sit in a hut for an
instructional lecture with Captain Tanida speaking

The Americans are likely to land
here

He points to the South beach on a map of Iwo

40 40

CAPTAIN TANIDA
Cross fire positions will be here
here and Here

He points to Motoyama and Suribachi

CAPTAIN TANIDA
Now to be truthful we will
likely be outnumbered by the
Americans in troop size and air
5 and naval support But we have a
great advantage Can anyone tell
me what that is

The soldiers look at each other at a loss still trying
to digest the fact that they will be outnumbered in all
aspects

Finally Shimizu stands up

SHIMIZU
The Americans are weak-willed and
inferior to Japanese soldiers

CAPTAIN TANIDA
Very good Shimizu Why is that

SHIMIZU
They are not as disciplined and
let their feelings interfere with
their fighting

CAPTAIN TANIDA
That is correct

Saigo and Nozaki give each other looks distrustful of
Shimizu

Q Captain Tanida displays a picture of a uniformed American

medic
CAPTAIN TANIDA
Here is the uniform of an American
medic He should be your target
for Americans will risk the lives
of many soldiers to save this one

to keep an eye on your commanders

KURIBAYASHI
Thank you for your concern Nishi
but I have it under control
Admiral Ohsugi is gone and I trust
General Sato and Colonel Adachi
will keep things in order

Baron Nishi looks unconvinced
ADMIRAL ICHIMARU the new naval officer walks into the
command hut His right leg has been injured from a
previous war wound and he limps as he walks in
ADMIRAL ICHIMARU
Admiral Ichimaru reporting for
duty sir

As they watch the SAND EXPLODES before them in black
plumes The men cover their heads from the falling
debris

A BOMB disintegrates the instructional tentthat the men
have just escaped

Yamazaki in the distance sitting upright He approaches

him

confirming what they fear

KURIBAYASHI
For 5000 years no foreign army
has desecrated the land of Japan
All of you must fight like
Nipponjin In the name of our
fathers who held back the Russian
Marauders at Port Arthur and
Mukden and our forefathers before
that who fought against the
invasions of the mongols over 600
years ago I ask each of you to
defend this island to the Limit of

Nozaki picks up a similar belt He looks around the
room Some of the other soldiers have similar belts

He looks at Shimizu

NOZAKI
Doesn’t look like Mr Kempeitai
has a thousand-stitch belt does
he

SAIGO
Maybe he thinks it will clash with

believe in superstitions anyway

Shimizu finally picks up a similarly stitched belt

EXT MT SURIBACHI MORNING 59
Saigo carefully navigates around the base of Suribachi

He comes to a crag and dumps the filthy contents of the
bowl

Saigo looks up to see the ARMADA OF SHIPS -- an imposing
mass of 485 ships converged around the island

The sight of the enormous fleet causes Saigo to drop the
bowl It tumbles down into a crevice

SAIGO
No

Saigo reaches down into the crevice tries to retrieve
the bowl but can’t reach it

SAIGO
Damn

Suddenly a WHISTLING NOISE causes Saigo to run for
cover A BOMB EXPLODES sending sand flying in the air

PUFFS OF WHITE SMOKE off the ships convey that a SHOOTING
BARRAGE has begun

‘Dark FIREBALLS and GEYSERS of black sand and rubble ERUPT

over the landscape

Saigo crawls back towards the crevice and tries to reach
down again without success He looks up to the Heavens

laughing aren’t you You think
this is funny oe

Saigo looks around and findsa STICK He‘fishes down in
the crevice and catches the bowl on the end of the stick

Cateftlly carefiily he raises the stick balancing the
bowl on it

A BOMB EXPLODES in the sand yards away from him But
determined Saigo manages to keep it steady

At last he pulls it up and takes it with relief then
runs for the caves

As he runs a BOMB SHELL falls in his path

Saigo drops into the sand still holding the pot bracing
for the explosion but nothing happens

Saigo slowly gets up and stares at the dud He looks to
the Heavens

houses lit with lanterns offering
toasted mochi cakes and warm
amazake to passersby All along
the river tiny white houses lit
with candles It’s really
something you ought to see The
pure white snow the river the
warm glow of the candles

No it’s just a letter
He reads through it

OKUBO
What does it say

Saigo Shimizu and other soldiers in the cave stop to
listen to what the letter says

BARON NISHI

Its from his mother

(translating)
‘I have mailed you a couple of
books to read I hope you’ like
them Yesterday the dogs dug a
hole under the fence They ran
all the way down the neighborhood
and terrorized the Harrisons’
roosters before we found them’

108

Baron Nishi smiles at this

- ® BARON NISHI
‘Dont worry about us Just take
care of yourself and come back
safely Remember what I said to
you -- always do whats right
because it is right I pray for a
speedy end to the war and your
safe return’

The soldiers are silent
Suddenly a BARRAGE of SHELLING and GUNFIRE ERUPTS
The men quickly go to their posts

They FIRE at the advancing Americans with MACHINE GUNS
and RIFLES

Baron Nishi directs his men at the front

empty except for a roll of bandage

The medic covers Baron Nishi’s eyes with a strip of
bandage

-Lt Ito stares into the sky He has had two days to

contemplate life beyond the war

A lone SEA BIRD flies overhead small and fragile making
its way through the remnant smoke of bombardments up
into the darkening blue sky

A change comes over Ito and he starts to CRY

At last he gets up He unstraps the bomb from his back

and leaves it

He makes his way to a naturally formed cave and sits
there on the ground CRYING

He wants to live

JAPANESE PLANES can be heard

He smiles as he sees the cargo planes approach bearing
the unmistakable emblem of the red sun His smile turns
to dismay when one by one the planes are shot down

EXT PACIFIC OCEAN -— NIGHT 113

GUNNERS on ships quickly home in on the lumbering

Japanese planes and let out an ALL-OUT ASSAULT sending

the supply planes careening into the Pacific in horrific

fireballs

Kuribayashi anguishes as he watches the life-saving
supplies drop into unreachable zones

EXT NEAR FRONT LINE 116

Soldiers spot the supplies parachuting At first they
CHEER loudly

But as they land the soldiers soon realize they are
irretrievable

A few brave souls make a mad dash out towards the
supplies but are easy targets and are immediately GUNNED

quickly move out towards the well holding two metal
canisters each

SAIGO
Theyve got to make it

NIGHT FLARES light up the sky

The soldiers make it to the well without incident They
quietly fill their containers with the precious water

Saigo licks his lips

Back at the sand bank the soldiers continue to look out
for signs of the enemy but all seems peaceful

Successful they begin hauling the containers when a
bright WHITE LIGHT spots them and freezes on them

They try to duck down but its difficult with the
containers

Suddenly the area explodes with RAPID FIRE
The two soldiers are gunned down

The men in the sand banks return fire but they are
outgunned

The METAL CANISTERS are RIDDLED with BULLETS and the
precious water seeps into the ground

Saigo rolls over

SHIMIZU
I have been thinking about what
Lieutenant Colonel Nishi said
That I’ve never even met an
American It’s true I dont
know anything about the enemy

Shimizu looks towards the cave ceiling

SHIMIZU
I was taught that the American
soldier is weak but he is not I
was told that they are savages
but that American who died -- his
mother writes the same things that
my mother would write

SAIGO
I guess we’re all just soldiers
doing our job

SHIMIZU
I want to do my duty to my country
and my God but I don’t want to
die for nothing

Saigo is silent

SHIMIZU
What do you think Saigo Tell me
what you think

SAIGO
People tell us we serve God by
dying a valorous death on a
battlefield I don’t know much
but if you ask me I think God
would be more pleased if we lived
to experience the world He
created You’re still young
Shimizu

A appreciate all the beautiful
shades of orange that change with
each minute-of each dusk You
Havent been to enough village
festivals to taste their local
flavors and to discern the subtle
differences in their obon dances
You haven’t been with a woman long
enough to recognize her curves and
valleys and to hear the sound of a
baby’s heart beat--your baby’s
heart beat beneath the skin of her
belly Shimizu you haven’t even
begun to experience life to know
what you are sacrificing

Tears stream down Shimizu’s cheeks

SHIMIZU
Saigo will you surrender with me

Ne a new bounty in the soil outside of the naturally formed

Do you have family back home

SAIGO
Just my wife and a little baby
girl born last summer I haven’t
seen her yet

KURIBAYASHI
Funny Saigo I have just realized
that the irony of being a soldier
is that what compels us to do our
duty is our families and it is
likewise the thought of our
families that makes it difficult
to fulfill it

KURIBAYASHI

‘No end to this marching forever
and ever

In life we are separated from one
another

Parted by a thousand and ten
thousand li

Each a different corner of the
sky

The road so long so perilous

Who knows when we shall see each
other again’

Saigo listens quietly Tears begin to run down his face

Sorry sir

Yankee military boots will soon
tread on our motherland However

acted as honorable warriors of the
Imperial Empire fighting to the
last “No one is to return from

night was over they wished me
well and though I’m glad to be
going home I felt a bit sad to
say Goodbye Then I had to make
the long drive back to my
apartment If you were here
Taro I would put you in the
passenger’s seat And Yoko and
your mother would be in the back
