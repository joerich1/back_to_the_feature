FADE IN

1 TALL GRASS BLOWING GENTLY IN A BREEZE - DAY - (OPTICAL)

The sound of children playing running through the
grass as one boy (ARTIM 12) pokes his head out we
see by his facial skin pattern that hes an alien his
cloths are simple homespun As other alien children
pursue him in a game of tag into the rocky foothills we
BOOM UP to reveal a breathtaking view of a rural
community along a vast sparkling lake mountains rising
in the backgroundsome odd-like livestock graze

on the hillside

2 A FARM - LONG SHOT

A woman uses a bike pump to get well watera man works
the soil in his fields wipes his brow waving to --

3 A WOMAN (ANIJ 38)

whose beauty immediately captivates us as she strolls
past the farm the wind barely jostling her close cut
curly hair She takes us to a busy outdoor farmers

market at the edge of a hand-constructed village set
against a natural rock face barrier These are the Baku
people and from the opening shots we can feel the simple
charms of this beautiful place and who would blame us
for wanting to be there to escape a life like this
where people seem to have all the time in the world to
chat with neighbors taste a piece of fresh fruit and
enjoy the day Anij nods hello to people including
SOJEF (male 42) the community leader she smiles as a
vendor slices a piece of fruit for her

4 NEW ANGLE - ANIJ - (OPTICAL)

From the point of view of the rock face behind the
village Although we may not realize it yet we are

watching through a window now slightly discolored
pulling back to see a mysterious figure in an isolation
suit standing incongruously beside her his suit glowing
with a green force field None of the Baku are aware of
him as he takes readings with a sophisticated sensor
device built into his suit Now our pullback reveals
were inside a duck blind Low lighting levels A bi-
level gallery of Starfleet officers and members of an
alien race (the Sona) observe the peaceful village scene
like sportswriters at the ballpark

VARIOUS ANGLES

move in and out of the main viewing room with PADDS

Outside several other cloaked figures move among the
unknowing Baku

ANGLE - THE RANKING SONA OFFICER (GALLATIN 60)

Inside the duck blind Like all Sona his face is
stretched like a rubber band about to snapthey look
like victims of three too many cosmetic surgeries He

but with superhuman strength he tosses them aside with
ease Meanwhile Baku people unaware of the fight
greet their children back happy theyre safe

17 EXT MARKET - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL) - ANGLE ON ARTIM

as he moves to Sojef his father

SOJEF
It must have been some kind of
odd electrical storm

But as Sojef speaks Artim turns to see the floating head
of Data DECLOAKING in mid-air barely a yard away as he
removes his helmet the boy yells jumps back
falling as Data makes eye contact with him The Baku
scatter Sojef pulls the boy away to safety

DATA
Secondary protocols active

We notice a slashing burn wound on Datas neck as he
fights off an invisible force again we hear a ripping
crunch and a green force field sputters briefly -- a Sona
man in a torn isolation suit partially DECLOAKS as he is
slammed to the ground unconscious Data rips off the

rest of his suit revealing himself picks up a weapon

from the unconscious Sona aims it at the rock face

18 INT DUCK BLIND - (OPTICAL)

The observers dive for cover as he points the weapon this

way But Data fires it to the left of the window
EXT ROCK FACE - (OPTICAL)

And then fires again to the right and again above
each hit knocking out generators

finally the rock face shimmers like a computer image
breaking up and disappears revealing the high-tech

stations behind it

CRUSHER
A year And the Federation
Coucil decided to make them a
Protectorate already
PICARD
In view of our losses to the Borg
and the Dominion the Coucil
feels we need all the allies we

As the turbolift doors open we see much activity can
hear music coming from the party Picard puts ona
brighter face As they exit

PICARD communique from Admiral
Then you were made for Dougherty

LA FORGES COM VOICE (CONTD)
Its about Data

INT BANQUET ROOM

Maybe thirty Starfleet officers most human but a few
Bajorans Trills and Borians peppered about a small
group of musicians play a festive tune The crowd moves
back as their Captain enters and Troi escorts him to
REGENT CUZAR 50 and her delegation of about eight
extremely short aliens shes at least a foot shorter
than he is

PICARD
Yew-cheen chef-faw Regent Cuzar
Welcome aboard the Enterprise

CUZAR
Captain Picard may I welcome you
in the time-honored tradition of
my people

An aide steps forward and she takes an alien headpiece
from him and reaches up to put it on Picards head

Picard has to make himself shorter to make it work the
other aliens throw tiny seeds over Picard and Cuzar (like
rice at a wedding) Picard smiles trying not to show

how silly he feels

CUZAR
We are so honored to be accepted
within the great Federation
family
(excusing him)
Please I know you have other

guests to greet

PICARD
We have a dance later I believe

CUZAR
I look forward to it

One of her misters escorts her away Picard turns to
Troi -

PICARD
How are we supposed to dance
Her head will be in my

Hes interrupted by GEORDI LA FORGE who approaches
looking concerned holding a PADD hands it to Picard

LA FORGE
Excuse me sir Admiral
Doughertys aboard the Sona ship
in sector four-four-one Hes
requesting Datas schematics

TROI
Is something wrong

LA FORGE
The message doesnt say

PICARD

(concerned)
Data should have been back by
now They were only scheduled to
observe the Baku village for a
week

(to Geordi)
Set up a secured com-link to the
Admiral in the anteroom

Geordi acknowledges moves away a Bolian science
officer grabs Picard by the arm

BOLIAN OFFICER
Captain Hars Adislo we met at
the Nel Bato Conference last

chance to read my paper on
thermionic transconductance

As Picard reacts smiling with no recollection

A MONITOR -- INT ANTEROOM OFF BANQUET ROOM - (OPTICAL)

Admiral MATTHEW DOUGHERTY 69 a confident charismatic
officer is transmitting from a Sona ship
DOUGHERTY
Hes not acknowledging any
Starfleet protocols not
responding to any of our hails

We pull back to see were in a small room off the
reception Picard faces the monitor (hes removed the
headpiece) Geordi observes A Starfleet Ensign stands
guard just outside the door to make sure theyre not
disturbed

PICARD
You have no idea what
precipitated his behavior

DOUGHERTY
(shakes his head)
And now hes holding our
people hostage down there

PICARD
The Enterprise can be at your
position in two days Admiral

DOUGHERTY

Thats probably not a good idea
Your ship hasnt been fitted for
this region there are
environmental concerns

PICARD
What kind of concerns

DOUGHERTY
We havent fully identified the
anomalies yet Theyre calling
this whole area The Briar
Patch it took us a day to reach
a location where we could get a
signal out to you Just get me
Datas schematics Ill keep you
informed

(Picard acknowledges)

The screen returns to a starfield

PICARD
Send him the schematics

Geordi acknowledges

PICARD
Ensign

ENSIGN

(moving inside)
Sir

PICARD
Report to the galley and tell the
chef to skip the fish course

The Ensign gives a puzzled reaction but an order is an
order He exits Geordi gives his Captain a curious
look

PICARD
I want our guests to depart as
quickly a etiquette allows
Ill ask Worf to delay his return
to DS9 so he can join us Were
going to stop by sector four-four-
one on our way to the Goren

system
LA FORGE
(understanding)
They are in opposite

directions sir

PICARD
(dry)
Are they

La Forge smiles leaves Picard takes a beat to collect
himself and we may sense how the clutter in a Captains
life may wear him down He puts the alien headpiece back
on with sullen eyes then restores his diplomats face
and returns to the reception

women use powder and heavy but carefully applied make-up
to obscure their faces Sona costumes are made of
expensive fabrics with latinum chains and exquisite
jewels as accessories suggesting a wealthy culture that
values materialism Sexy female attendants from various
alien races dressed provocatively work with laser tools
to repair cracked raw skin off Sona faces We move to

here but such are the demands of alien alliances

RUAFO (CONTD)
Your Federation procedures have
made this mission ten times as
difficult as it needed to be

DOUGHERTY
Our procedures were in place to
protect the planets population
from unnecessary risk

RUAFO
Planets population Six hundred
people You want to avoid
unnecessary risks Next time
leave your android home

He motions to the girls to finish up presses his

personal comlink answering the call

RUAFO

chair)
Lie down Admiral The girls
will take twenty years off your
face

DOUGHERTY
Another time

Ruafo studies his own face in the mirror

RUAFO
Your self-restraint puzzles me
Admiral You continue to deny
yourself every benefit this
mission has to offer

DOUGHERTY
I prefer to wait until we can
share the benefits with all the
people of the Federation

PICARD (OC)
Tea Earl Grey Hot

The tea appears as we pull back to reveal Picard studying
a PADD he reaches out for the tea without his eyes
ever leaving his reading walks across the room and
sits at a dining table that has stacks of various work
materials more PADDS charts and graphs and maps a
half-eaten salad sits in front of him and in a move
that would challenge the worlds greatest juggler he
pokes a fork of salad into his mouth with one hand as he
sips his tea with the other finding a spot to prop the
PADD so he can still read and now his mind asking a
silent question reaching over to grab a chart and as he
pulls it over he also spills the salad plate splashing
gorgonzolla dressing over his jacket sighs a chime
at the door

PICARD
Who is it

RIKER (OC)
Commander Riker

Picard looks at himself shrugs what the hell

PICARD
Come

Riker enters with a PADD eyes drawn to Picards stained
jacket

PICARD
Im the casualty of a working
lunch
Picard takes off his jacket and as the scene

continues he changes

PICARD (CONTD)
Ive been going over the few star
charts we have of this Briar
Patch Its full of supernova
remnants false vacuum
fluctuations

Riker looks at the star chart brushes it off

RIKER
Â« and gorgonzolla cheese

PICARD
We wont be able to go any faster

than one-third impulse in that
muck

RIKER
(handing him the PADD)
Nothing dangerous turned up in
the astrometric survey

PICARD
So where are the âenvironmental
concerns the Admiral was talking
about

RIKER
(shrugs)
The only unusual readings were
low levels of metaphasic
radiation from interstellar dust
across the region

TROI
Weve downloaded all the files on
the duck blind mission as well as

intelligence reports on the
Sonta

PICARD
(including Riker)
You have two days to become
experts Mister Worf your job
and mine will be to find a plan
to safely capture Data

Worf holds up a modified tricorder

WORF
Ive already modified a tricorder
with one of his spare actuation
servos Its operational range is
only seven meters but it should
shut him down

(appreciating his
initiative)
Its good to have you back Worf

TROI

(off her computer)
The Sona discovered an M-class
planet with humanoid life six
months ago Turned out its in
us to get approval for a
sociological study The
Federation Council suggested it
be a joint mission

RIKER
Why was Data assigned

TROI
Environmental concerns again
An android could be safely
exposed to the elements during
the installation of a duck
blind
LIBRARIAN (CO)

Sssshhh
They turn to see -- a middle-aged prune-faced woman at
desk looking sternly at them Troi goes back to her
reading but seems distracted sees a paper notepad on

the desk rips off a shred and during the following
exchange starts to press it between her thumb and
forefinger into a little ball Whispering now --

RIKER
I dont see anything to suggest
the Sona have any interest in
sociology

TROI
What are they interested in

RIKER
Wine women and song

TROI
You should feel right at home
with them

She throws the ball of paper and hits Riker on the side

of the head he turns but shes looking innocently at
her screen he rolls a little paper ball himself
RIKER

Nomadic collectors of precious
metals jewels

TROI
(joking)
Hmm I should feel right at home
with them
RIKER
Youre in luck it says here

theyve taken women from several
races as indentured servants

Just as hes about to throw his paper ball back at her

he sees the librarian staring at him Riker caught
sheepishly turns back to his computer a beat
RIKER
(reacts)

Look at this

She stands leaning over Rikers shoulder to see his
computer putting one arm on the desk

RIKER (CONTD)
The Sona have been suspected of

producing mass quantities of the
narcotic ketracel-white their
ships are rumored to be equipped
with isolytic subspace weapons
outlawed by the Second Khitomer
Accord

ANGLE EMPHASIZING HER BREAST

as it rests gently on his upper arm and hes deeply
aware of that breast touching him

TROI
Why would we be involved with
these people

RIKER
Good question

They exchange a brief glance that has nothing to do with
the Sona As his eyes return to the computer scrolling
she casually plays with hair at the nape of his neck

RIKER
You havent done that in a long
time

TROI
What

RIKER

What youre doing to my neck

TROI
(flirtatiously)
Was I doing something to your
neck

He pauses his scrolling as he comes to something
curious

RIKER
It says here that some form of
genetic damage has apparently
prevented the Sona from

procreating
TROI
No children
RIKER
If thats true theyre a dying

race

Suddenly a tiny ball of paper hits Riker
RIKER
Hey

He turns to see an alien ensign looking too innocently at
his computer The librarians eyes fix on Riker and

Troi obvious troublemakers Troi points to Riker

TROI
He started it

Riker reacts starts to leave Troi follows

RIKER
I didnt do anything I swear it

an eyebrow we hear nothing he moves forward to
La Forge and Perim

PICARD
When was the last time we aligned
our torque sensors

PERIM
Two months ago sir

PICARD
They dont sound right

La Forge and Perim react work the controls exchange a
look at the results

When I was an ensign I could
detect a three-micron mis-

Ruafo and I have decided to send
in an assault team

PICARD
Sir Commander Worf and I have
been working on several tactical

dangerously violent Captain
Considerable damage was done to

crew is at the mercy of those
people on the planet

PICARD
If our first attempt to capture
Data fails I will terminate him

I should be the one to do it
Im his Captain And his friend

Dougherty pauses to consider but Ruafo wants none of
Picard

RUAFO
It isnt safe for you to remain
in this area

DOUGHERTY
Hes right Our shields have
been upgraded to protect against
the environmental anomalies

PICARD
We havent noticed any ill
effects

The Admiral studies him a long beat is sympathetic to
Picards position

DOUGHERTY
All right You have twelve
hours Captain Then I want you

The hostages are sitting at wooden tables with the Baku
having lunch the Sona quietly keeping to themselves at
separate tables To the side Artim and friends play a
game (TBD) that displays extraordinary hand-eye
coordination well beyond human abilities

ANGLE - PICARD TROI AND CRUSHER

and several engineers enter the village on foot phasers
drawn their faces curious at the picnic before them
the hum of conversation fades for a moment it almost
seems that the hostages are sorry to seem them
Gallatin and the Starfleet lieutenant move to Picard

PICARD
Are you all right

LIEUTENANT
Weve been treated extremely well
by these people

The children have resumed their game Troi observes them

with keen interest Picard notices
PICARD
Counselor
TROI

They have an incredible clarity
of perception Captain Ive
never encountered a species with
such mental discipline

Sojef Anij and several of the Baku including another
village leader TOURNEL move toward them

SOJEF
My name is Sojef Captain

PICARD
Jean-Luc Picard my officers
Doctor Crusher and Counselor
Troi

SOJEF
Would you like something to eat

PICARD
No were here to rescue them

SOJEF
As you wish But I would ask you
to disarm yourselves This
village is a sanctuary of life

Picard measures the request then holsters his
phaser the rest of the away team does the same
PICARD

(to Crusher and Troi)
Prepare to transport the
hostages to the ship

CRUSHER
They should be quarantined
before joining the ships
population

Picard nods They move off with Gallatin and the
Lieutenant The work crew moves to disassemble the duck
blind

PICARD
(to Sojef)
We were under the impression they
were being held against their
will

ANIJT
Its not our custom to have
guests here at all let alone
hold anyone against their will

Picard makes eye contact with Anij her tone is not
harsh but we can sense an inner strength in this woman

SOJEF
The artificial lifeform would not
allow them to leave He told us
they were our enemies and more
would follow

ANIJT
Are you our enemy

SOJEF
Anij

PICARD
My people have a strict policy of
non-interference with other
cultures In fact its our Prime
Directive

ANIJ
(dry with a smile)
Your directive apparently doesnt
include spying on other cultures

PICARD
If I were in your shoes Id feel
the same way after what happened
(beat)
The âartificial lifeform is a
member of my crew Apparently
he became ill

TOURNEL

There did seem to be a phase
variance in the positronic matrix
that we were unable to repair

Picard reacts not the sort of thing one expects to hear
from someone in a place like this

ANIJT
I believe the Captain finds it
hard to believe that wed have
any skills repairing a positronic
device

SOJEF
Our technological abilities
arent apparent because weve
chosen not to employ them in our
daily lives We believe when you
create a machine to do the work
of a man you take something away
from the man

ANIJT
(dont take us
lightly)
But at one time we explored the
galaxy just as you do

PICARD
You have warp capability

ANIJT
Capability yes But where can
warp drive take us except away
from here

Clearly establishing that she and her people have very
little interest in life beyond their world Picard

allows himself to take in this glorious setting a
humming bird hovers briefly nearby it is the kind of
paradise that would appeal to any contemporary man trying
to escape the clutter of his life if only for a brief
respite and at least to that extent --

PICARD

I understand

In the background the Starfleet hostages embrace their
hosts as they say farewell

PICARD

I apologize for our intrusion

Shes sitting on the sofa making some notes on a PADD
when the door chimes

Come in
(Riker enters)
Hi

RIKER
Got a minute I need a little
counseling
(off her surprise)
First time for everything Do
I lie down or what

TROI
Whatever makes you comfortable

Riker lies down only he winds up with his head on her
lap looking up at her

TROI
This isnt one of the usual
therapeutic postures

RIKER
But its comfortable

TROI
Why dont you try sitting up

RIKER
Or you could try lying down

TROI
Youre in quite a mood today

He finally sits up stealing a kiss along the way she
rises shocked but not upset

TROI
Do you really need counseling or
did you come down here to play

Riker is on his feet now approaching her She retreats

RIKER
Both
(off her look)
I think Im having a mid-life
crisis

TROI
(retreating)

I believe you

RIKER

Im not sleeping well

TROI
Doctor Crusher has something
thatll take care of that

She allows him to catch her

RIKER
What I need I cant get from
Doctor Crusher

(inches away)
Counselor do you think its
possible for two people to go
back in time to fix a mistake
theyve made

TROI
On this ship anything can
happen And usually does

He closes the gap between them kisses her deeply

TROI
Augh
RIKER
Augh
TROI
I never kissed you with a beard
before

She pushes him out the door

RIKER
I kiss you and you say âaugh

She hits the panel and the door slides closed in his
face a tiny grin comes to her face

INT ENGINEERING CORRIDOR - MOVING WITH PICARD and
LA FORGE

La Forge has a headache hes trying to work through
shows Picard several burned components

LA FORGE
I took these out of Datas neural
net they contain memory
engrams

PICARD

Do you know how they were
damaged

he
LA FORGE
By a Sona weapon
(off Picards look
Theres no doubt about it sir
Thats what made Data
malfunction

PICARD
The Sona reports claim they
didnt fire until after he
malfunctioned

LA FORGE
I dont believe it happened that
way

PICARD
Why would they fire at him
without provocation

LA FORGE
All I know is that he was
functioning normally until he was
shot Then his fail-safe system
was activated

PICARD
Fail-safe

LA FORGE
His ethical and moral subroutines
took over all of his basic
functions

PICARD
So youre saying he still knew
the difference between right and
wrong

LA FORGE
In a sense thats all he knew
The system is designed to protect
him against anyone who might try
to take advantage of his memory
loss

PICARD
And yet he attacked us And told
the Baku we were a threat
Why is the unspoken question on Picards face
ANGLE

They reach a door with a significant security system in
place Geordi hits several panels Picard notices his

eye discomfort

PICARD

Its nothing Im just tired

The door slides open to reveal a closet-sized space with
Data mounted on the wall in a diagnostic device Geordi
touches a panel which activates Data

PICARD
Youre aboard the Enterprise

LA FORGE
Youve had a serious malfunction

his nose should pant and his lip
should curl

PICARD
From the mission

DATA
I was in an isolation suit
collecting physiometric data on
Baku children My last memory
is going into the hills
following a boy

EXT VILLAGE - DAY - (OPTICAL)

Artim is playing with a tiny palm-pet a colorful cross
between a caterpillar and a jellyfish that crawls over
his hand and between his fingers as Sojef moves over
with Picard and Data the boy looks at Data with fear
in his eyes Data cant help but notice

SOJEF
Artim do you remember where you
were on the day of lightning
when the artificial lifeform
appeared to us

ARTIM
In the hills by the dam

PICARD
Can you show us

Artim puts his pet in a pocket (or it can have its own
little pouch on Artims belt if he has no pockets) and
leads the way Several Baku including Anij and Tournel
curiously follow As Picard makes eye contact with her
she moves over

ANIJT
Havent you disrupted our lives
enough

She says it gently but honestly

PICARD
I understand how you feel We
just want to retrace Datas
movements that day

ANIJ
Why

PICARD
(a cautious reply)
I dont like to leave questions
unanswered

ANIJT
(evenly)
Then you must spend your life
answering questions

She moves away Picard watches her she doesnt look
back

ANGLE ON DATA

Who notices Artim still glancing at him with fear To
reassure him --

DATA
There is no need for concern I
am operating within normal
parameters now

ARTIM
Youre what

DATA
I am better

The androids manner only seems to frighten Artim more
Before Data can say anything else Sojef comes and leads
him away giving Data a cool smile that says in effect
I dont want any artificial lifeform talking to my son
Data reacts After a thoughtful beat moves to walk with
Picard

DATA
I believe the boy is afraid
of me

PICARD

Its nothing personal data You
have to remember these people
have rejected technology And
you

DATA
I am the personification of
everything they have rejected

PICARD
Until this week that young man
probably never saw a machine let
alone one that walks and talks

DATA
And I do not believe I made a
very good first impression
It clearly bothers Data to be the object of fear The
boy glances over his shoulder once more at the android

looks quickly away

PICARD

enchanted by the natural beauty the antithesis of

They come to a brook Artim hops on one foot across
rocks in the water and without stopping to think Picard
does the same thing looking like a little boy then
notices a curious look from Data which makes him collect
himself and adjust his jacket Anij glances over at
Sojef with concern The others cross in adult fashion

EXT PLANET SURFACE - DAY - LOOKING DOWN TO SEE A SMALL

Data is having trouble with is tricorder

DATA
Tricorder functions are limited
due to heavy deposits of

Curious there appear to be
strong neutrino emissions coming
from the lake

Staying with Data s he follows the tricorder to the edge
of the lake a brief pause and then in a Harold
Lloyd sort of moment he steps into the lake up to his
ankles pauses again to look at the tricorder and then
disappears under water

it is conceivable I was shot
to protect the secret of its
existence

to deceive the Baku

transported en masse A week
later maybe a month youve been
relocated on a similar planet

We may notice a look in Anijs eyes - she knows why but
doesnt intend to say Picard and Data dont notice her

shadows of the village hologram and then another and
another the shots hit walls revealing portions of the

find a new home a home that
would be isolated from the
threats of other worlds

regenerates the cells in our

It may not last after we leave
If not I just wanted before we
go
(beat)
Ive never actually seen a

sunrise

Picard considers him a long beat and they turn to see -

THE SUN - (OPTICAL)

cracking the horizon turning the lake red

PICARD AND GEORDI

bathed in the sunlight Picards face looking younger
contented in the new sun

THE SUNRISE - VARIOUS SHOTS

the silhouette of an eagle-like bird coasting a foot
above the water the morning breeze brushing the red-

tinged field of tall grass

GEORDI

A tear rolls down his cheek
WIDE - (OPTICAL)
as the sunlight cascades over the village and hills and

if we werent sure this place was magic before we
certainly know it now

EXT SPACE - THE FOUR SONA SHIPS (OPTICAL)

INT READY ROOM (OPTICAL)

Dougherty and Ruafo enter Ruafo is furious --

RUAFO
Am I to understand youre
not releasing my men Captain

Picard at his desk working looks up makes strong eye
contact with his guests

PICARD
(quietly)
I found the holoship

That stops Rutafo He looks at Dougherty who realizes
some damage control will be necessary

DOUGHERTY
Ruafo why dont you let the
Captain andl

Ruafos face is so tight it seems its going to break

RUAFO
No

and it does -- a crack opens up from his forehead to
his chin and blood dribbles out of it

RUAFO (CONTD)
This entire mission has been one
Federation blunder after another
You will return my men or this
alliance will end with the
destruction of your ship

He exits Dougherty measures Picard for a beat

DOUGHERTY
Youre looking well Jean-Luc
Rested

PICARD

Your Briar Patch turned out to
be more hospitable than I
expected

DOUGHERTY
(nods)
Thats why we put chromodynamic
shields in place - so our people
wouldnt feel the effects from
the metaphasic radiation

PICARD
Â» Or understand that they were
participating in the outright
theft of a world

(beat)

I wont let you move them
Admiral Ill go to the
Federation Council

DOUGHERTY
Im acting on orders form the
Federation Council

PICARD
(reacts beat)
How can there be an order to
abandon the Prime Directive
DOUGHERTY
The Prime Directive doesnt
apply These people are not
indigenous to this world They
were never meant to be immortal
Well simply be restoring their
natural evolution

PICARD
Who are we to decide the next
course of evolution for these
people

DOUGHERTY

There are six hundred people down
there Well be able to use the
regenerative properties of this
radiation to help billions

(beat)

The Sona have developed a
procedure to collect the
metaphasic particles form the
planets rings

PICARD
A planet in Federation space

DOUGHERTY
Right We have the planet and
they have the technology -- a

technology we cant duplicate
You know what that makes us
Their partners

PICARD
Our partners are nothing more
than petty thugs

DOUGHERTY

(dismissing that)
On Earth petroleum once turned
petty thugs into world leaders
Warp drive transformed a bunch of
Romulan thugs into an empire We
can handle the Sona Im not
worried about that

PICARD
Someone probably said the same
thing about the Romulans a
century ago

DOUGHERTY
With metaphasics lifespans will
be doubled an entire new

medical science will evolve
(beat)
I understand your Chief Engineer
has the use of his eyes for the
first time in his life would
you take his sight away from him

PICARD
There are metaphasic particles
all over The Briar Patch Why
must this planet be

DOUGHERTY

(interrupting)
The concentration in the rings is
what makes the whole damned thing
work Dont ask me to explain
it I only know they inject
something into the rings that
starts a thermolytic reaction
After its over the planet will
be unlivable for generations

PICARD
Delay the procedure Let my
people look at the technology

DOUGHERTY
Our best scientific minds already
have We cant find any other
way to do this

PICARD
Then the Sonta can establish a
separate colony on this planet
until we do

DOUGHERTY

It would take ten years of normal
exposure to begin to reverse
their condition Some of them
wont survive that long

Besides they dont want to live
in the middle of The Briar
Patch who would

PICARD
The Baku

Picard and Dougherty look at each other a long beat
PICARD

We are betraying the principles
upon which the Federation was

founded this is an attack on
the very soul of the Federation
(beat)

This will destroy the Baku
Just as cultures have been
destroyed in every other forced
relocation throughout history

DOUGHERTY
We are only moving six hundred
people Jean-Luc

PICARD
(beat)
How many people would it take
before it becomes wrong A
thousand Fifty thousand A
million

Dougherty has taken this as far as he intends to

DOUGHERTY

Im ordering you to the Goren
system File whatever protests
you wish to By the time you do
this will be all done

(moves to exit)
Im also ordering the release of
the Sona officers

Hes out Picard sits at his desk for a long beat

130 INT BRIDGE

Worf at Conn Data at Ops Riker at command they look
up at Picard as he comes out of the Ready Room
PICARD

crosses to the turbolift Before he gets in he turns

sitting his head locked in position by an apparatus a
female attendant actually giving him a facelift in front
of our eyes the device stretching his face ever
tighter as she snips off skin by one ear with a laser in
a bloodless surgery that heals his wound

RUAFO
Gallatin So the righteous
Starfleet Captain finally
released you Did you encounter
any problems on the surface

GALLATIN
(acknowledges)
No sir But it wasnt easy
being among them

RUAFO

Im sure Just dont forget what
they did to us

(Gallatin nods)
Well have them rounded up in a
day or two we neednt bother
with the Federation holo-ship
any more Just get the holding
cells ready

Gallatin acknowledges leaves To the attendant -

RUAFO
Im going to miss these little
flesh-stretching sessions of
ours my dear

As she pulls up his other ear

INT YACHT COCKPIT - (OPTICAL)

Picard out of uniform works a transporter and cases of
military supplies MATERIALIZE on a loading platform that
will lower into the cargo hold of the yacht he studies
a translucent geological scan of the surface that we will
hear more about later

DATA (0C)
Re-routing the transport grid to
avoid detection was wise sir
but the transporter is rarely
used after oh-two-hundred hours

Picard turns to see Data Troi Crusher La Forge Worf
and Riker have entered the hatch All but Riker and
Geordi are out of uniform

TROI
Taking the Captains yacht out
for a spin

WORF
(examining the cargo)
Seven metric tons of ultritium
explosives eight tetryon pulse
launchers ten isomagnetic

RIKER
You must be planning on doing
some hunting

PICARD
Go back to your quarters
(no one moves)
Thats an order

No one moves

RIKER
No uniform No orders

Geordi with his normal eyes moves forward

LA FORGE
How could I look at another
sunrise knowing what my sight
cost these people Captain

Picard looks at them with appreciation

DATA
I feel obliged to point out that
the environmental anomalies may
be stimulating certain rebellious
instincts common to youth that
could affect everyones judgment
Except mine of course

CRUSHER
Okay Data what do you think we
should do

Data looks to everyone considering a beat picks up a
phaser rifle activates it

DATA
Saddle up Lock and load

The family united looks to their Captain for
instructions Picard looks to them with deep affection

PICARD
They wont begin the procedure
while the planet is inhabited
So our job is to keep the planet
inhabited

He looks at Riker and La Forge knowing that his first
officer and chief engineer must stay with the ship

PICARD (CONTD)
Go back and put a face on whats
happening here Make the Council
see the Baku Its too easy to
turn a blind eye to the suffering
of an unfamiliar people

Riker and La Forge acknowledge Picard takes an extra
moment to look perhaps for the last time into the eyes
of his first officer with affection

PICARD

Theres a short letter I left you
all just some sentimental
nonsense the computer will
bring it to your attention at oh-
four-hundred Id just as soon
you delete it

RIKER
Fat chance Ill post it on
every monitor on the ship

Picard grins with nice embarrassment then with a serious
look to Riker --

PICARD
Well hold out as long as we can

Riker understands theyre counting on him Picard hits a
panel and the weapons sink into the yacht

as the non-uniformed officers move to take their posts
Riker takes Troi in his arms kisses her good-bye The
others react in surprise

DATA
Apparently the environmental
anomalies are also stimulating

Worf shuts him up with a hard look Data gets the
message sits in a cockpit chair and quietly begins to
work

EXT SPACE - THE YACHT - (OPTICAL)

INT SONA SHIP TACTICAL ROOM - (OPTICAL)

Ruafo watches a realistic simulation of a space
procedure on a monitor a small but sophisticated
injector assembly sailing into the planets rings begins
to fire charges that start a thermolytic reaction (we see
only the early stages here) Gallatin enters with a
PADD

RUAFO
The injector performs perfectly
in every simulation

GALLATIN

Sir as the Enterprise left
orbit one of their support craft
went down to the surface

(Ruafo reacts takes

the PADD)

It appeared to be the Captains
Yacht Five persons on board

RUAFO
Were not waiting until
morning take the shuttles and
get everyone off the surface
tonight
Gallatin starts to leave pauses as --
RUAFO
Gallatin if Picard or any of his
people interfere eliminate
them
EXT VILLAGE - NIGHT - (OPTICAL)
On a door opening as we hear a bell ringing the
face of Artim fills the screen his eyes scared and
as we reveal his point of view of the village its a
stunning sight -- Tournel pulling on the warning bell in
the square hundreds of people moving with urgency

supplies are being packed onto the backs of llamas
Worf Data and Troi are unpacking the cases of military
supplies that have already been loaded from the
(unseen) yacht Picard is going over charts with Anij
and Sojef near-by
VARIOUS BAKU
(ad lib)
What is it Whats going on
Whats happened Is something
wrong

TOURNEL
Were leaving the village
take only what you need Bring
food we may not be back for
days

Artim jumps with a start as a slim high-tech device on a
stake suddenly lights up like a Christmas tree beside
him sees Data who just activated it

DATA

It is a transport inhibitor It
will help prevent Sona ships
from beaming anyone off the
surface

Artim overwhelmed and still scared of the android backs
away from Data without responding and moves toward his
father Picard is showing Anij and Sojef the translucent
geo-scans we saw on the yacht

PICARD
these are the veins of
kelbonite running through the
hills the more concentrated
the deposits the more trouble
theyll have with their
transporters our route will
keep us close to these
deposits as possible

Artim moves beside his father holds onto him

PICARD (CONTD)
When were forced away by the
terrain well use transport
inhibitors to compensate The
mountains have the highest
concentrations Once were
there transport will be
virtually impossible

ANIJT
There are caves in those
mountains

PICARD
(acknowledges)
We can hold them off a long
time once we get there
(beat)
But they will not make it easy to
get there

Worf and Data move over
DATA

Captain Ive activated transport
inhibitors around the village

PICARD
Good Lets begin to move these
people out

WORF

Should I distribute phasers to
the Baku sir

PICARD
No Well be responsible for

but as the ships continue to pass over and the
DEMATERIALIZATIONS in the same gap continue suddenly
Sojef is beamed away

ARTIM
My father

His voice is lost in the cries of the scared people who
surge even harder forward toward the protection of the
next inhibitor and now the boy is thrust to the ground
As he falls the little palm-pet slips out of his
pocket Artim desperately tries to save him from being
stepped on finally snatches him in his hand But now
the crush of people threatens to trample the boy and its
a reminder how scary it can be to be small Suddenly an
arm reaches down and scoops him up and as we follow
Artim up we can see its Data who has rescued him
their eyes connect briefly as Data carries him forward
in the pushing crowd

GALLATIN
Theyre following the kelbonite
deposits using the
interference to block our
transporters

RUAFO
Recommendations

DOUGHERTY
Take me down Let me talk to
Picard

RUAFO
Talk we should send down an
assault team and take them by
force

DOUGHERTY

That is not an acceptable option
If people get hurt all the
support we have in the
Federation

RUAFO
Federation support Federation
procedures Federation rules
look in the mirror Admiral
the Federation is old in the
last twenty four months its
been challenged by every major

power in the quadrant -- the
Borg the Cardassians the
Dominion they all smell the

scent of death on the Federation
Thats why youve embraced our
offer because it will give
your dear Federation new life
Well how badly do you want it
Admiral Because there are hard
choices to be made now If the
Enterprise gets through with news
about their brave Captains
valiant struggle on behalf of the
defenseless Baku your
Federation politicians will
waver your Federation opinion
polls will open a public debate
your Federation allies will want
their say need I go on

Dougherty takes a deep breath knows Ruafo is right
Gallatin hates the idea of a violent assault gives
Dougherty the other option hes desperately seeking --

GALLATIN
There is an alternative to an all-
out assault Isolinear tags
would allow our transporters to
lock on to them

RUAFO
Wed have to tag every one of
them that would take time

and we dont have it The
Enterprise is only nineteen hours
from communications range with
the Federation

DOUGHERTY
Ill order Riker to turn around

RUAFO
Picards first officer Do you
really believe hell listen

Ruafos clearly lost faith in the Admirals ability to
control the situation Doughertys jaw tightens

RUAFO
My ships are capable of
intercepting the Enterprise

before it reaches the perimeter
I could send them to escort
it back but Commander Riker
might not want to come

And we slowly push into Dougherty as he steps across his
self-imposed moral line

DOUGHERTY
Send your ships

Dougherty tries to digest the knot in his stomach

EXT PLANET SURFACE - DAWN (MATTEOPTICAL)

Deep into the foothills now much steeper terrain
feeling the power of the mountains near-by seeing the

their way up its almost biblical in scope with Picard
and Moses leading the way

ANGLE WITH DATA AND ARTIM - (OPTICAL)

Theyve been walking silently for some timeArtim
struggling inside to reconcile what hes been taught
about machines and the experience hes had with Data

ARTIM
My father told me I shouldnt
talk to you

DATA
I understand

ARTIM
I dont

They exchange a glance Artim sighs troubled

ARTIM
Not everyone here agrees with
him I mean you know about
machines There was even a
big fight about it once
(beat)
Do you like being a machine

DATA
(considering)
I aspire to be more than I am

ARTIM
I know why
(off Datas look)
So people like us wont be afraid
of you any more

DATA
(a beat)
Perhaps that is true

The boy is obviously tired from miles of walking
uphill

ARTIM
Dont you ever get tired

DATA
My power cells continually re-
charge themselves

ARTIM
I cant imagine what it would be
like to be a machine

Data studies him (and it should be noted that his
responses are a deliberate attempt to enlighten Artim
give the child a new perspective on what it means to be
an android)

DATA
Perhaps it would surprise you to
know that I have often tried to
imagine what it would be like to

be a child

ARTIM
Really

DATA
Really

ARTIM

(with fatigue)
For one thing your legs are
shorter than everyone elses

DATA

But they are in a constant state
of growth Do you find it
difficult to adapt

(off Artims

perplexed look
A childs specifications are
never the same from one moment to
the next I am surprised that
you do not trip over your own
feet

ARTIM
Sometimes I do
DATA

My legs are eighty-seven-point-â
two centimeters They were
eighty-seven-point-two
centimeters the day I was
created They will be eighty-
seven-point-two centimeters the
day I go off line My operation
depends on specifications that do
not change

(beat)
I cannot imagine the
experience of growing up or even
tripping over my own feet

Artim is seeing the artificial lifeform in a whole new
light now which is exactly what Data intended

ARTIM
But youve never had adults
telling you what to do all the
time or bedtimes or having
to eat food you dont like

DATA
I would gladly accept the
requirement of a bedtime in
exchange for knowing what it is
like to be a child

ARTIM
(considering)
Do machines ever play

DATA
I play the violin and my chess
routines are quite advanced

ARTIM
No I mean
He tries to find a way to explain gets an idea -- pokes
him with a finger
ARTIM

Youre it
And he starts to run away

DATA
Im what

Artim frowns stops

ARTIM
Chase me
DATA
For what purpose

ARTIM
Because youre it And if you
tag me then Im it

DATA
But I can run much faster than
you I am capable of exceeding

forty-seven meters per second

ARTIM
(sighs walking back)
Data havent you ever just
played for fun
DATA
Androids dont havefun
ARTIM
Why not
DATA
(beat)
No ones ever asked me that
before
ARTIM

If you want to know what its
like to be a child you need to
learn how to play

As Data considers

zipping scarf in a breeze that plays in his ears like a
natural flute his breath becomes more even as he
relaxes into this altered state and he feels

WORF
Negative Hes established a
security field around the control
room

PICARD
Is there any other way to disable
the injector

Gallatin thinks then calls up
ANGLE (OPTICAL) - COMPUTER DISPLAY SHOWING THE
INJECTOR ASSEMBLY

isolating the section that we saw launched into the rings
in the simulation

GALLATIN
Wed have to remove the ignition
matrix directly from the injector
assembly but in less than two
minutes that injector is going
to be launched into the rings

RESUME

WORF
Sir I volunteer to

Picard moves toward a transporter station starts to
Remove his jacket

PICARD
Denied Commander I have no
intention of informing your bride
that youre not coming home

The countdown is at 141

INT COLLECTOR - (OPTICAL)

The weird cavernous room is left with a skeleton of
structured elements now that all the sails are fully
unfurled it almost reminds of the support foe an old-
time roller coaster -- a cobweb of crisscrossing pipes

and conduits and planks

RUAFO - (OPTICAL)

in a control area safely removed from the injector
working controls the digital display moving back from
135 he doesnt immediately see --

ANGLE - PICARD - (OPTICAL)

MATERIALIZING near the injector This is not an area
built for manned operation so Picard has to make do

with the structural elements

hes been beamed to a platform a few yards from the

injector and now he has to crawl across what is
essentially a plank on his back under the injector
assembly

ANGLE (OPTICAL) - LOOKING DOWN ON PICARD

moving across the plank the dark recesses of the vast
chamber below him he slides into the assemblys grill

with many open spaces

ANGLE FAVORING HIS POV - THE IGNITION MATRIX - (OPTICAL)
where another digital display shows the countdown at
119he takes a Sona tool out of a pouch on his
costume goes to work still lying on his back he
inserts the tool and removes the panel cover to expose
the interior of the ignition matrix

WITH RUAFO (OPTICAL)

as an alarm goes off on his consolehe reacts

switches off the forcefield and goes out to look up at --

HIS POV - PICARD (OPTICAL)

working on the injector

WIDE - (OPTICAL)

as Ruafo climbs toward Picard

PICARD

knows hes running out of time now he works on

removing an interior safety screen that shields the

components it finally slips off and falls clanging as
it hits structural elements below the countdown hits
109

RUAFO - (OPTICAL)

climbs

PICARD - (OPTICAL)

reaches in to pull out the ignition matrix but a small
forcefield blocks his hand he frowns examines the
security sensors begins to disconnect them

RUAFO (OPTICAL)

starts to cross a plank toward Picard their eyes
connect

ON THE INJECTORS GRILL - (OPTICAL)

Picard succeeds in defeating the security system the
forcefield fritzes off the countdown at 47 he

reaches for the component but Ruafo gets there first
lunges at Picard seconds before he can complete his
task They grapple across the grill and Picard slips
through one of the openings

ANGLE EMPHASIZING THE FALL - (OPTICAL)

Picard barely catching himself by grabbing on to the
grill

RUAFO

scrambles onto the assembly reaches Picard and starts
to uncurl

PICARDS FINGERS

holding onto the grill trying to force him to let
go
PICARD - (OPTICAL)

grimaces looks to see

THE DIGITAL DISPLAY HITS 20

RESUME - (OPTICAL)

The ignition matrix engages and the nitrogen flow that
follows throws Ruafo slightly off-balance Picard
knowing its now or never releases one hand and grabs
Ruafo by the neck and yanks his head down hard against
the grill stunning him Picard pulls himself up and
moves quickly into the blinding nitrogen toward the
detonation circuit again

he literally disappears for a brief second as Ruafo
comes back at him again the countdown at 10 Ruafo
pulls him away from the controls 05 Picard leaps
for the plank he crawled over on Ruafo looks at

HIS POV - THE DETONATION CIRCUIT

and its gone

RUAFO

reacts looks at

PICARD

on the plank who holds up the circuit for him to see

PICARD
Looking for this

THE DIGITAL DISPLAY - 000

TWO SHOT PICARD AND RUAFO - (OPTICAL)

perhaps no more than a foot apart but an instant
later Ruafo slides away with the injector as its
launched a protective forcefield zaps into place as it
enters space Picard watches as it moves toward the
rings

EXT COLLECTOR - CONTINUOUS (OPTICAL)
As we saw in the simulation the injector continues to
move toward the rings

INT INJECTOR - ANGLE THROUGH THE FORCEFIELD - (OPTICAL)

to see the rings getting closer and closer and as we
burst into them the bright colorful metaphasic dust
and gases swirling around us like a hurricane

RUAFO - (OPTICAL)

begins to change growing younger and younger face-
lift falls into middle-age then taking on the Baku
facial skin pattern as he reaches young adulthood then
adolescence then childhood White out

EXT VILLAGE - DAY

The Baku returning from the hills Troi waves from a
distance and we move to see Riker standing with Worf
(back in uniform) waving back

WORF
Have I mentioned the
unanticipated rewards Ive
discovered in a permanent
relationship

RIKER
Permanent that sounds like a
long time Worf

WORF
(with irony)
Life is short Commander

Worf leaves Riker to think about that and as we move
away with him he takes us to Gallatin watching the
children play tag in the high grass with a personal
longing

ANGLE TO SEE PICARD ANIJ AND SOJEF - (OPTICAL)
walking slowly observing Gallatin Anij is almost fully
recovered Picard is back in uniform

SOJEF

I wish there was a way to bring
them back home

PICARD
Ask them

SOJEF
Im afraid theres too much
bitterness on both sides

They pause as they notice Crusher escorting a young Baku
woman returning from the mountains she tries to
recognize Gallatin were too far away to hear what is
said but the woman embraces Gallatin as a mother
embraces a lost son and Crusher looks over and smiles
to Picard before she leaves the couple alone Anij
looks to Picard realizing --

ANIJT
Mother and son You arranged
this

PICARD

I thought it might begin the
healing process

Sojef considers Picard shakes his hand with a unstated
but deep appreciation for all that this offlander has
done He moves away to join Gallatin and his mother
Anij looks to Picard with love

ANIJT
What am I going to do without
you

Picard reacts slightly surprised that she has
anticipated that he has to go

PICARD
These are perilous times for the
Federation I cant abandon it
to people who would threaten
everything Ive spent a lifetime
defending

PICARD (CONTD)
Im going back to Earth to
slow things down at the
Federation Council

She nods she knows

PICARD
But I have three hundred and
eighteen days of vacation time
coming I plan on using them

ANIJT
Ill be here

Worf moves over
WORF
Captain the Ticonderoga has

moved into orbit

QUARKS VOICE
Worf
They turn to see a Ferengi (QUARK) approaching ina
bathing suit with a beach umbrella and two barely dressed
Dabo girls

WORF
What are you doing here Quark

QUARK
The same thing everyone else in
the quadrant is going to be doing

here as soon as I build the
greatest spa in the galaxy
(sotto)

these people dont have any
religious thing about casinos do
they

PICARD
There arent going to be any spas
on this planet

QUARK
Do I know you

PICARD
(ignoring the
question)
This world is about to become a
Federation protectorate which
will end any and all attempts at
exploitation by people like you

QUARK
Explain to me how five thousand
time-share units right there
along the lake would be
exploiting anyone

PICARD
Mister Worf have this
uninvited offlander and his

quests beamed to the Enterprise
Well deposit them at Deep Space
Nine

WORF
Must you sir

Worf takes Quark away by the scruff of his beach shirt
his disappointed babes follow trailing away --

QUARK
Youll hear from my Nagus

Theyre gone
ANIJT
Do you really think your mighty
Federation would be interested in
protecting six hundred people

PICARD
The mighty Federation could
learn a few things from this
village

He kisses her The signature humming bird appears
sweeping up in the breeze and hovers briefly in front of

them and as he takes her hand to his cheek

slows its wing movements becoming more fluid and
gentle as the moment extends
308 ANGLE ON TROI CRUSHER WORF LA FORGE AND RIKER

prepared to transport
LA FORGE
Wheres Data
309 ANGLE - THE HIGH GRASS

a shot like our opening shotexcept the head that
peeks through the grass this time is Datas and as we
widen we see he has taken Artims earlier advice and is
playing tag with all the kids

CRUSHER
(calling)
Data Its time to go
Data stands up straight as he hears the voice looks at
Artim a long beat and this is a kids moment

underplaying the sentiment the way kids would

DATA
I have to go home now

ARTIM
Bye

Data nods

DATA
Bye

Artim smiles as Data joins the others
ARTIM
Dont forget -- youve got to
play a little bit every day

Data acknowledges

RIKER
Good advice

Riker takes Trois hand suggesting perhaps a new
permanent commitment Picard moves to join the others
presses his combadge
PICARD
Enterprise seven to beam up

Energize

Picard exchanges a final look with Anij as they
DEMATERIALIZE
