wall Nikolai eyes it and frowns

Its just a map with NO MARKINGS ON IT AT ALL There are
drawings of rivers and territories but no words or symbols

NIKOLAI

A Pylawnka map Old Soviet spy trick
The map is split into three parts on
three separate pieces of microfilm
One contains the topography

(points to projection)

contains the symbols The only way
the map makes sense if you have all
three on top of one another

did you find in the book

Something rather interesting

Alex grabs some papers out of the hollowed-out Brothers

EXT SIBERIAN WASTELAND 1968 -- DAY

TITLE CARD Siberia Soviet Union February llth 1968

The barren tundra goes for miles in every direction A
thicket of trees sit off in the distance Its eerily quiet

GEORGE (VO)
The legend is that a British Mi6é
agent Blue Jay had gotten wind
that the Soviets were developing a
new superweapon dubbed Prometheus
Something big A game changer

A young HENRY PAXTON aka BLUE JAY emerges from behind a
tree in all-white camouflage He was already a nerdy Brit
with glasses and a moustache

GEORGE (VO) (CONTD)
The legend is true but no one ever
realized that he had two other agents
with him

TWO OTHER AGENTS emerge from the snow behind him
One is a young GEORGE Hes a charmingly handsome young man
with a devilish grin He plays with a TOOTHPICK that he

twirls around his finger and sticks into his mouth

GEORGE (V0O) (CONTD)
There was me - codename Raven

The second figure is a beautiful young Russian woman SPARROW
Her long blonde hair accents her porcelain skin

GEORGE (VO) (CONTD)
And a Soviet double agent - codename
Sparrow A real fox

The three eye one another and nod

GEORGE (VO) (CONTD)
We had tracked Prometheus to a top
secret bunker in Siberia and were
ordered to destroy it

The three eye a HATCH hidden beneath some snow
INT UNDERGROUND LAIR 1968 -- MOMENTS LATER

A gigantic sleek UNDERGROUND LAIR is filled with metal beams
that curve into a metal HAMMER and SICKLE adorning the wall

The room is lined with 60s-era computers and lab equipment -
beakers filled with chemicals test tubes etc SCIENTISTS
wearing labcoats frantically go over charts and diagrams

DR ZARIPOV a stern Russian man in an officers uniform and
white labcoat studies a large MAP OF THE WORLD which takes
up an entire wall On the map the Soviet Union is colored
in bright red and all of the other countries in pale grey

The MAIN DOOR opens and Zaripov turns around - his eyes widen
Two SOVIET SOLDIERS walk in their hands up in the air
The THREE SPIES machine guns drawn lead them in

GEORGE (VO)

Gaining access inside was the easy
part - it was once we were inside
that we ran into a snag

George heads over to Zaripov and eyes him He then points
to a gigantic METAL DOOR lining one wall

GEORGE (CONTD)
Let me guess - Prometheus is behind
Door 1

DR ZARIPOV
The most powerful weapon the world
has ever seen For decades men have
tried to create it but it took MY
genius to bring it to-

GEORGE
I get it its amazing Whats the
code to the door

Zaripov thinks for a moment George COCKS HIS GUN
DR ZARIPOV

(quickly)

George sighs heads over to the keypad and prepares his
finger

GEORGE
Lets hear that again Slower

DR ZARIPOV
3855301-

Sparrow suddenly notices something

AN OLDER FEMALE RUSSIAN SCIENTIST slowly reaches for A LEVER
ON THE WALL Something is written in Russian above the lever
Sparrows eyes widen She knows what that lever does

The WOMANS HAND GETS CLOSER

SPARROW
Stop

BLAM - Sparrow fires SHOOTING THE WOMAN Everyone looks
over confused

The woman falls back RIGHT ONTO THE LEVER pushing it down
WEE OOH WEE OOH - A SIREN blares and RED LIGHTS FLASH

A scientist uses this distraction to open a drawer in his
desk Theres a GUN INSIDE

The scientist grabs the gun and

BLAM BLAM - Starts shooting at the spies who duck down
behind a desk

A GREEN GAS SUDDENLY EMITS FROM THE AIR CONDITIONING VENTS
The gun-wielding scientist who stands near the vent waves
his hand through the gas

The scientist suddenly DROPS DEAD

SPARROW (CONTD)
Nerve gas

The three spies take a deep breath The SOLDIERS and
SCIENTISTS start dropping like flies

The MAIN DOOR to the room begins to SLOWLY CLOSE

BLUE JAY
(holding breath)
Mmpff Mmmpffff

The gas begins to completely fill the room The three spies
all holding their breath run through the pile of bodies and
head for the door

Its only got a few inches to go

EXT SIBERIAN WASTELAND 1968 -- DAY

The vast tundra still sits calm and silent

WHAP - A hatch door hidden in the snow FLIES OPEN
Sparrow climbs out followed by Blue Jay and George all
GASPING for breath George closes the hatch behind him

Sparrow points a gun at the hatch door lever and BLAM -
blows it off Theres no way to open the door now
BLUE JAY
What the hell are you doing

Sparrow kneels down and covers the hatch door with snow

SPARROW
Hiding the place

BLUE JAY
Hiding Our mission was to destroy
Prometheus not hide it

SPARROW
Theres no time This place is now
toxic for weeks and we cant allow
the wrong spy plane to spot us just
standing out here

BLUE JAY
So what then Youre just going to

leave the worlds most powerful weapon

just sitting out here

SPARROW
Thats exactly what were going to
do because no one will ever find it

She gestures around her Theres nothing in every direction

GEORGE
But there must be someone in the
Soviet ranks who knows where this
place is

SPARROW

No there is not The project was
so top secret that including myself
there were only five people in
government who knew its whereabouts

(beat)
And I spent the last week personally
removing them from the equation

George eyes her with growing admiration He takes out a

TOOTHPICK and begins to play with it

GEORGE
What about the map

Sparrow reaches into her bra and takes out a MICROFILM

three eye it

SPARROW
We all agree that this weapon is too
powerful for ANY one nation to hold
alone - yes

The

They eye one another They nod

SPARROW (CONTD)
Then let us also agree that none of
us will ever return alone We will
never be able to find this place
unless we are together And we will
only come back if we have the
opportunity to destroy it

With seriousness she hands them each a piece of the
microfilm

They all think for a moment and nod

then thousands if not millions of
innocent people could potentially be
killed This woman

(points to Miri)
Means nothing in the grand scheme of
things

Rick gives Miri a look

RICK
And youre okay with this

MIRI
Comes with the job

RICK
Well pardon me for trying to save
your life

BAM - The train suddenly JOLTS and STARTS MOVING They
all look around

INT ENGINE ROOM -- NIGHT

Alex stands at the controls He grabs the accelerator and
PUSHES IT ALL THE WAY DOWN The train SPEEDS UP

He heads for a BOX on the wall which he opens to see filled
with WIRES He locates a particular wire and YANKS IT OUT

He closes the box and heads out
EXT TRAIN TRACKS IN POLISH COUNTRYSIDE -- NIGHT
Nikolai and his men watch the train take off

Alex jumps off of the engine and rolls in the snow One of
the thugs helps him up He gives Nikolai a nod

The train reaches the TRACK SWITCH and CURVES INTO THE FOREST
instead of going straight It picks up speed fairly quickly

INT DINING CAR -- NIGHT

The passengers all look around feeling the train speed up
Miri looks out the window

MIRI
Weve changed tracks

George immediately reaches for the EMERGENCY BRAKE cord
and YANKS IT Nothing happens

Miri continues to look out the window The train passes a
sign that reads GROZBA - MOSTOWY M AUT

MIRI (CONTD)
Oh no

RICK
What did that mean

MIRI
Danger - Bridge is out

George immediately rushes to the window and undoes the clasps

GEORGE
Get everyone to the back of the train

Miri turns away and looks to all the other passengers

MIRI
Everyone to the back Now

George opens the window and without hesitation CLIMBS OUT
disappearing into the darkness

RICK
Where are you going

Rick runs to the window and looks up just in time to see
Georges feet disappear over the top of the train He thinks
for a moment

RICK (CONTD)
Here goes nothing

He climbs out
INT ROOF OF THE TRAIN -- CONTINUOUS

and pulls himself on top of the speeding train He looks
around to see George heading to the front of the car

George eyes the gap to the next car and JUMPS
LANDING ON THE OTHER SIDE

GEORGE
AHH

George COLLAPSES and clutches his leg in pain

Rick rushes atop the speeding train He reaches the front
of the car eyes the gap

RICK
Well if he could do it then you can
do it
He JUMPS
Landing right next to George He YELLS to be heard

RICK (CONTD)
Are you okay

GEORGE
(wincing)
Im fine

RICK
Have you done this before

GEORGE
Not this model train

RICK
I cant believe I just did that

Rick glances up

RICK (CONTD)
Uh oh

Theres a TUNNEL ONLY A FEW FEET AWAY Rick DUCKS DOWN ON
TOP OF GEORGE straddling him as the roof whizzes by mere
inches above them

They finally pass through the tunnel George eyes Rick lying
on top of him

GEORGE
Now this is awkward

Rick rolls off of George and helps him up George limping a
little Together they head towards the front of the train

They reach the ENGINE CAR Rick spots SOMETHING AHEAD He
tapes George on the shoulder and points George looks to
see a long twisty track that ends at a BRIDGE

But the BRIDGE ONLY EXTENDS A HUNDRED FEET AND BEYOND THAT
IS DESTROYED Below it is a DEEP ROCKY RAVINE

GEORGE (CONTD)
We should probably hurry

George drops down into the engine room Rick follows
INT CABOOSE -- NIGHT

The passengers are now all crammed into the caboose Theyre
worried Miri stands amongst them trying to keep her cool

INT ENGINE ROOM -- NIGHT

George and Rick stand before the large control panel covered
with hundreds of dials switches and gauges

George heads to the box on the wall and opens it up He
eyes the bundle of ripped wires

GEORGE
They cut the brakes

RICK
Then what do we do

GEORGE
(thinks)
I know We derail it

RICK
Excuse me

GEORGE
If we pick up enough speed then
when we hit that curve well fly
right off the track causing the first
five or six cars to flip but leaving
the back of the train unharmed

RICK
What about us

GEORGE
We jump

RICK

This is a terrible idea

GEORGE
Well its the only one weve got

George pushes down the accelerator with all of his might
Hes struggling in pain Something occurs to Rick

RICK
Why dont we just detach the engine
from the rest of the train

George thinks for a moment He gives Rick a look

GEORGE
Thats much smarter

Rick smiles proud
EXT GAP BETWEEN ENGINE AND TRAIN -- NIGHT

The door flies open and the two run out Rick leans over
the edge and looks forward to see the BRIDGE APPROACHING
George eyes the floor beneath them

GEORGE
There should be a red lever on the
bottom of the connection All you
have to do is pull the lever and
then remove the pin

RICK
By all YOU have to go you mean all
I have to do

GEORGE
Yep

Rick sighs and begins to climb down George grabs his legs

Rick hangs below the train as it speeds along The ground
rushes by right underneath him

Rick eyes the ground a bit shaken He snaps out of it and
spots the RED LEVER on the connection He reaches for it

But its JUST OUT OF REACH

RICK
Lower

George lowers Rick down Ricks fingers are MERE INCHES
FROM THE LEVER

The train HITS THE TURN at top speed and ROCKS BACK AND FORTH

George LOSES HIS GRIP and RICK FALLS Rick GRABS A POLE as
George GETS HOLD OF HIS LEGS AGAIN

RICK (CONTD)
Watch it

GEORGE
Sorry

Rick reaches over and GRABS THE LEVER He twists it and the
connection makes a sound

George glances ahead The BRIDGE IS 100 YARDS AWAY

GEORGE (CONTD)
Make it snappy

Rick looks over and grabs the pin He grips it and pulls
It DOESNT BUDGE

RICK
The pin is stuck

George looks over again The bridge gets closer

GEORGE
Unstick it

Rick grips the pin and PULLS with all of his might The pin
SLOWLY PULLS OUT Very slowly

George looks over The bridge is about 25 yards away

GEORGE (CONTD)
Rick

BAM - The Pin YANKS OUT sending the engine car SPEEDING
OFF ON ITS OWN George GRABS RICK and PULLS HIM UP ON THE
LEDGE of the second car

The two watch as the engine shoots forward reaches the
bridge and SAILS OFF OF THE BRIDGE disappearing

BOOOM - The engine SMASHES into the ravine and EXPLODES

The momentum of the train continues the rest of the cars
HEADING TOWARDS THE BRIDGE George and Rick eye one another

The train slows down but it still creeps towards the edge
Theyre about twenty feet away fifteen feet

Rick closes his eyes He cant stand to watch

Ten feet five feet

The train stops

Rick opens his eyes The train car sits RIGHT ON THE EDGE
Rick peers over to see a several hundred foot drop with the

destroyed engine at the bottom

RICK
Whoa

EXT TRAIN BRIDGE -- LATER

The train still resting on the bridge is now surrounded by
dozens of POLICE CARS and RESCUE VEHICLES POLICEMEN and
PARAMEDICS help passengers off and tend to their wounds

Miri stands amongst them and searches the crowd She seems
fairly displeased She looks over and spots TWO FIGURES
traipsing through the snow towards a ROAD in the distance

MIRI
The bastards ditched me

EXT ROAD IN POLISH COUNTRYSIDE -- NIGHT

George and Rick are the figures and they head up to the
small road where the occasional truck passes Rick seems a
little excited almost like hes coming off of a high

RICK
I mean when you see it in movies
theres always fire but not THAT
much fire

George sticks his thumb out to hitchhike
GEORGE
We made it out alive and thats the
important thing

RICK
So where are we going next
GEORGE
We arent going anywhere Youre
headed to Paris to finish out this
computer trip like you planned

RICK
And what about you

GEORGE
Im finishing what I started

RICK
Alone Youre dumping me

GEORGE
No offense Rick I needed you to
get to Europe and youve fulfilled
that purpose Youre not made for
the rest Theres going to be
violence guns maybe some sex
Its a mission that requires grit

RICK
I have grit I just proved it I
just saved YOUR ass on that train

GEORGE
Yes you did and I thank you

RICK
And Im a technological whiz if you
havent noticed An area in which
you are seriously lacking

GEORGE
You are enjoy your conference

Rick passes him to walk in front determined

RICK
Im coming with you End of story

George lets out a smile that Rick cant see

GEORGE
But a few ground rules 1) Im
right about everything 2) No
sleeping with CIA Agents especially
ones named Miri 3) Im always
right about everything

RICK
I question your logic but will agree
to the terms

GEORGE
Good So if you must know were
going to a small town in Russia named
Iznoski to look for Svetlana Volkova

RICK
Who

GEORGE
Sparrow

He shows off the OBITUARY from the newspaper Certain letters
are circled

RICK
I hate to break it to you but Im
pretty sure this means shes dead

GEORGE
No thats code Old spy trick
Fake your own death and leave a code
in your obituary to lead friends to
your hiding spot

He points to the circled letters

GEORGE (CONTD)
See it spells out Iznoski

RICK
Cool

GEORGE

Im not a gambling man but if Nikolai
Morosov was able to find Blue Jay
then theres pretty good odds that
hell find her If that happens
then all bets are off

(spots something)
TRUCK

George starts waving his arms because a large TRUCK
approaches The truck stops and the DRIVER eyes them

GEORGE (CONTD)
Roo byezh

The driver thinks for a moment then points to the back
George nods to Rick and heads for the back George and Rick
reach the back to see

INT BACK OF THE TRUCK -- CONTINUOUS

- MIRI waiting for them She sits amongst loads of CRATES
MIRI
Oh hey guys Long time no see

Rick lets out a little smile George is not thrilled

holds up a CELL PHONE and looks to George
MIRI (CONTD)
Theres someone who would like to
speak to you
George eyes the phone for a moment and grabs it
GEORGE
(into phone)

Hello Messonnier

INT CIA HEADQUARTERS -- DAY

Miri

A gigantic room is filled with dozens of viewscreens and

maps There are CIA EMPLOYEES everywhere milling about

DIRECTOR MESSONNIER a skinny man in his seventies sits on
a desk and sips a cup of coffee as he looks over the screens

with a phone to his ear
For the rest of the scene we cut back and forth

DIRECTOR MESSONNIER
Hello George

GEORGE
Hows your wife She still thinking
about me

DIRECTOR MESSONNIER
Shes still thinking about the
promotion that I got over you

GEORGE
Oh yeah congratulations on that
And go fuck yourself

DIRECTOR MESSONNIER
Grandson Really

GEORGE
You do what you have to

DIRECTOR MESSONNIER
So youre out looking for Prometheus
I knew you never blew that thing up
like you said Well I hope you like
company because my agent isnt going
to leave your sight until that weapon
is safely in US custody

GEORGE
What Reception out here is really
bad

George THROWS THE CELL PHONE into the woods

MIRI
Hey Those are expensive

George starts to climb into the truck He looks to Rick

GEORGE
Never trust Theo Messonnier EVER
Especially if he says Trust Me

RICK
Got it thanks Ill keep that in
mind for when it NEVER comes up

The truck takes off George shoots Miri an annoyed look

GEORGE
Scoot over

Miri moves over equally as annoyed George opens up one of
the crates and looks inside

GEORGE (CONTD)
Come to daddy

He pulls out a bottle of VODKA
INT BACK OF TRUCK -- LATER

Miri now lies asleep George and Rick lean back bundled
up and pass the half-empty bottle back and forth Rick
listens to a story that George is telling

GEORGE
» SO then I said look Fidel
Ill tell you EXACTLY where you can
put those missiles

RICK
You did not

GEORGE
Did too He was pissed

RICK
I wish you would have told me you
were a spy years ago That way we
could have like hung out more

GEORGE
Glad to know Im not so boring
anymore

RICK

Hey give me a break - werent you
trying to be boring You should
consider it a compliment

GEORGE
I actually grew to like Antiques
Roadshow

George laughs to himself and takes a swig

RICK
So what exactly is it Prometheus

George grows very serious

GEORGE
Its a laser

RICK
Really Like a laser laser

GEORGE
During the cold war we were all
working on directed-energy weapons -
us The Soviets The Chinese
everybody But a laser presents a
huge problem You fire it and it
goes in one direction - forever

George pretends to fire a laser gun He then uses his other
hands to form a straight line away

GEORGE (CONTD)
So unless youre looking right at
the target a laser is fairly useless
as a long-range weapon Until Dr
Boris Zaripov came around

RICK
Wasnt he the bad guy from Bullwinkle

GEORGE
He was the brilliant Soviet scientist
who designed a machine that could
force a laser to arc So instead of
shooting straight up into space you
could have it curve over the surface
of the earth and land at any desired
coordinates you wished

He fires the laser beam finger again this time curving over
the top of his other hand and landing on the other side

GEORGE (CONTD)
Boom

George opens his fist A buzzed Rick is enthralled

RICK
Its the Death Star
(beat)
There was this movie-

GEORGE
I know what the Death Star is

Rick leans back his mind a bit blown

RICK
We gotta destroy that thing

GEORGE
Ive spent the last twenty years
mowing the lawn watching game shows
and playing Scrabble with retired
accountants who had no idea I could
kill them with my bare hands And
all that time I was thinking about
Prometheus But now Ive been given
the second chance And this time
Im not gonna screw it up

George takes a swig from the bottle and stares out at the
night sky Rick just watches him

GEORGE (CONTD)
Were almost there

RICK
Should I wake up Miri

GEORGE
Shes just pretending to be asleep
Arent you darling

Rick looks over to Miri who waits for a moment then opens
her eyes She sits up and looks to the bottle of vodka

MIRI
May I

GEORGE
Get your own

EXT ST PETERSBURG STREETS -- DAY

The historic city is hustling and bustling on this December
morning A BLACK SUV speeds down the street It doesnt
seem to have much concern for traffic laws

INT BLACK SUV -- DAY

Kaamen drives the SUV with Nikolai in the passenger seat
They listen to Russian punk music

Suddenly a WHITE VAN pulls out from an alley and BLOCKS THEIR
PATH Nikolais eyes widen Kaamen SLAMS ON THE BRAKES and

Suddenly ANOTHER WHITE VAN blocks them from behind

The doors to the van in front of them open MEN wearing all

The dark dingy basement is filled with boxes and rats
This room could be anywhere

NIKOLAI a HOOD over his head sits handcuffed to a chair in
the center of the room

A FIGURE WALKS up and REMOVES THE HOOD Nikolai looks up to
see MR MAHMOUD a MIDDLE EASTERN MAN in his fifties

NIKOLAI
I knew it was you

MR MAHMOUD
You knew it was me or you were hoping
it was me and not the Americans

NIKOLATI
The Americans would not have taken
me to such fine accommodations

MR MAHMOUD
Today is the deadline Where is our
weapon

NIKOLAI
Today is the official deadline
Yesterday was the earlybird deadline
and tomorrow is the late deadline

MR MAHMOUD
I still do not understand the purpose
of three deadlines A deadline should
be a deadline The members of the
Red Dawn are starting to worry that
we have wasted a lot of time and
money on you I am here to remind
you that if the weapon is not
delivered as promised then

Mr Mahmoud takes out a KNIFE and HOLDS IT UP

MR MAHMOUD (CONTD)
You get the idea

Nikolai stares him down Mr Mahmoud puts the knife away

MR MAHMOUD (CONTD)
Have you found the map

NIKOLAI
The first two pieces

MR MAHMOUD
And the third

NIKOLATI
The third will come to me

EXT IZNOSKI RUSSIA -- MORNING

Snow blankets the small town Several very old buildings

and shops sit near a church in what appears to be town square
Theres not a single person in sight

A TRUCK pulls into town - a different truck than before

this one filled with sheep George Rick and Miri hop out
of the back The truck drives off and George waves

They look around This place is dead

RICK
So where do we find Svetlana Volkova

smoke coming out of the chimney

GEORGE
That looks like a good place to start

INT IZNOSKI BAR -- NIGHT
The bar is PACKED with the entire population of the town

all drunken Russians toasting and laughing The stereo blasts
Russian pop radio

Rick George and Miri step in and closes the door behind
him Everyone turns and immediately eyes them For a moment

Everyone goes back to their business unconcerned with them
They head to the bar and wait eying the rough-looking
Russians all around him Rick gives them awkward smiles A

scary RUSSIAN BARTENDER walks up behind the bar

George gestures over Rick thinks for a moment and then
walks over to the Tall Russian He TAPS HIM ON THE SHOULDER
The guy turns around Hes a MEAN-looking man

RICK
How about you apologize to the lady

GEORGE
(in Russian subtitled)
My grandson says you should be treated
like a woman

The Russian grows confused and a bit angry He steps closer
to Rick

MIRI
(to George)

GEORGE
Hmm my Russian is a little rusty
(to man in Russian
subtitled)
You should be pushed around like a
whore
WHACK - The Tall Russian PUNCHES RICK IN THE FACE

Rick falls onto a table KNOCKING IT OVER The inhabitants
of the table stand up and start YELLING at the Tall Russian
One of them PUSHES THE TALL RUSSIAN He pushes back

A BAR ROOM BRAWL BREAKS OUT

Within seconds everyone is PUNCHING KICKING PUSHING and
BREAKING BOTTLES LEFT AND RIGHT Someone grabs a stuffed
bear head off of the wall and tosses it across the room
Another man gets shoved into the jukebox breaking it

George and Miri stand in the middle of all this George
looks to Miri

GEORGE (CONTD)
Want another shot

MIRI

Rick holding his nose scurries across the floor He stops
and looks up to see the TALL RUSSIAN STANDING OVER HIM

The Tall Russian reaches down and PICKS RICK UP He pushes
him against the wall and starts to roll up his selves ready
to pulverize him

VOICE (0S)
Hey

The Tall Russian looks over to see a OLDER RUSSIAN WOMAN
sitting by the fireplace She sips on a martini and reads a
copy of The Brothers Karamazov Shes incredibly sexy

INT SVETLANAS COTTAGE KITCHEN -- DAY

A fireplace crackles in the cozy wooden cottage Shelves
are covered with dozens of NESTING DOLLS

Rick sits in a chair in the kitchen with his hand on his
nose Svetlana stands and wipes blood off of his face
Miri fills a towel with ice

SVETLANA
You got off easy I have seen Igor
put men in hospital with one punch
And Russian hospitals are terrible

RICK
Im thanking my lucky stars

Svetlana takes Miris hand with the towel and PRESSES IT ON
RICKS FACE Rick winces

SVETLANA
(to Miri)
You hold this here

Svetlana heads out of the kitchen area and closes the door
Rick smiles to Miri

RICK
Thanks
MIRI
No problem Thank you for defending
my honor
RICK
(jokingly)

I will never do that again
She laughs
INT SVETLANAS COTTAGE
George stands by the fire and eyes the nesting doll
collection He picks one of the dolls up and opens it up -

theres a THROWING STAR inside He laughs

Svetlana takes her coat off to reveal a sexy outfit
underneath She walks over to George and gives him a look

GEORGE
It was forty years ago

SVETLANA
And that makes it all right

GEORGE
It was complicated I was called
out on a mission and-

SVETLANA
In the middle of the night

GEORGE
You knew how the business worked

SVETLANA
And if you remember correctly we
were going to leave it

GEORGE
I remember all too well Svet But
it was complicated If I

disappeared with a Soviet Agent never
to be heard of again then

She puts his finger on his lips to shut him up She doesnt
want to hear any more He eyes her finger as she traces it
along the side of his face

A TEA KETTLE over the fireplace begins to WHISTLE She takes
the kettle off of the fire and pours a couple of cups

SVETLANA
What brings you to my Iznoski Is
it what I think it is

She hands him a cup of tea and then takes a seat seductively
crossing her legs He quickly checks them out and then shifts
his gaze back to her face

GEORGE
Blue Jay was killed a few days ago
and his piece of the map stolen
Now theyre coming after yours

SVETLANA
And yours

GEORGE
Theyve already got it

She gives him a look

GEORGE (CONTD)
Long story

SVETLANA
So you need to find it first and
destroy it Sounds like fun

GEORGE

Do you still have your piece
SVETLANA

Not exactly
GEORGE

What does that mean

SVETLANA
After the gas attack on Prometheus
in 68 the KGB was convinced that
there was a mole within the
organization

GEORGE
There was You

SVETLANA
Yes but they didnt know that

INT SVETLANAS APARTMENT 1969 -- NIGHT

The small Soviet-era apartment is small and grey Svetlana
sits on the couch and reads a book

SVETLANA (VO)
They had to find the mole so they
sent soldiers to every agents home

The door KICKS OPEN and an ARMY OFFICER enters with SOLDIERS
Svetlana argues with the officer as the soldiers start
grabbing all over her possessions and putting them into boxes

SVETLANA (VO) (CONTD)
Under orders from the Kremlin they
collected all of our possessions in
search of any evidence of treason

The soldiers search through papers clothes books etc -
then dump them into boxes

SVETLANA (VO) (CONTD)
They took everything I had My
clothes my books my family photos
They said the items were now all
property of the state

GEORGE (VO)
And the map Did they find the map

Svetlana looks to her bathroom A soldier takes items out
of cabinet searches them then tosses them in a box

SVETLANA (VO)
They did but they didnt realize -
because I hid it in the one place
that no MAN would ever look

The soldier takes a DOUCHE BAG out of the cabinet

He eyes it for a moment unsure of what it is Another
soldier LAUGHS and POINTS AT HIM saying something in Russian

The first soldier realizing what hes holding tosses the
it at the second as if it were a hot potato The second
swats it away onto the floor
The officer SCREAMS at them The soldiers regain their
composure One of them grabs it off of the floor and tosses
it into the box They continue with their work
INT SVETLANAS COTTAGE -- CONTINUOUS

George continues to listen to Svetlanas story

GEORGE
You hid top secret microfilm inside
of a

SVETLANA

We call it a svéloch It is for-

GEORGE
I know what its for

SVETLANA
Obviously it was the perfect hiding
place because it was never found I
ended up framing someone else as the
mole and all was right with the world

GEORGE
So where is it now

INT MOSCOW -- DAY

The Kremlin City sits beautiful on the snowy day Red Square
is still decorated with Christmas lights

EXT LUBYANKA SQUARE -- DAY

A gigantic yellow brick building THE LUBYANKA sits in the
heart of Moscow GUARDS stand in front with machine guns

Across the street is a HOTEL Svetlana George and Miri
stand on the balcony of a room

INT MOSCOW HOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

The three eye the building and we can see that Rick sits at
a desk behind them with a LAPTOP

SVETLANA
The Lubyanka Former headquarters
to KGB and current home of Federal
Security Service of the Russian
Federation

GEORGE
Same sneaky bastards different name

SVETLANA
During The Cold War we used to joke
that The Lubyanka was the tallest
building in Moscow - because you
can see Siberia from its basement

George and Svetlana laugh Miri doesnt really get it

MIRI
Ah cold war humor

George shoots her a look

GEORGE
Oh are you still here

MIRI
Look I know you dont want me on
your little caper team but Im gonna
point out that this building is
massive Do you have any idea where
thesvoloch would be

SVETLANA
No clue Everything confiscated
during the mole hunt was locked away
in a-

RICK
Its in sub basement 7 Room 15

They all look at him He flips his laptop around to show a
SCHEMATIC of the building Svetlana studies the screen

SVETLANA
Smart boy youve got
GEORGE
Howd you do that
RICK
It would take me SO long to explain
it to you
GEORGE

(to Svetlana)
I dont suppose you still have any
connections inside

SVETLANA
Afraid not
(MORE )

SVETLANA (CONTD)
When the wall came down everyone I
still knew in the KGB was dismissed
or shot Sometimes both And not
necessarily in that order

GEORGE
So Ill just do the old flower-
delivery-man specialty

SVETLANA
Those days are long gone George
Now they do background checks and
retinal scans on EVERYONE - even
janitors and deliverymen If you
want in that building you need to
have the clearance to be there

Everyone gives Miri a look

MIRI
You do realize that if I am caught
breaking into the Russian Security
Headquarters it will spark an
international incident and undo years
of diplomatic relations right

GEORGE
Yeah But I also realize that youre
a spook like me and getting credit
for pulling off such a daring feat
would be worth the risk

She thinks for a moment He makes sense

MIRI
Okay even if we somehow get hold of
Ms Volkovassvdloch how are we
supposed to find Prometheus Wed
only have one part of the map

George reaches into his coat which is lying on the floor
and pulls out his GLASSES CASE He opens the case and reveals
the THICK BLACK GLASSES he wore on the train

GEORGE
Remember these I wore them on the
train 1962 Shuron Ronsirs A
classic but with a twist

He point to a tiny dot on the bridge

GEORGE (CONTD)
A pinhole-sized Polaroid camera

He SNAPS the Glasses in half to reveal that theres a tiny
CAMERA inside He pulls out full-size POLAROID PICTURE from
one of the arms and SHAKES IT He hands to her

The image is of the MAP that Nikolai projected on the wall
inside the train car

MIRI
Well Ill be damned

GEORGE
Hes still got it

Miri thinks this over for a moment The others wait
MIRI

You know I cant go to Messonnier

GEORGE
Better to ask forgiveness than
permission

MIRI

What about gear Weapons Vehicles

GEORGE
Not a problem sweetheart

She gives him a look

A THUG with a machine gun leans against the snowcat and smokes
a cigarette He yawns

Rick hides amongst the trees He takes out the tranquilizer
rifle and positions it He peers through the scope

look just as Rick DUCKS DOWN They see no one

They all have their back turned

He tries to get a clear shot at Nikolai Theres a pole in
the way He steps further into the room

George turns and sees Rick A huge smile crosses his face
Rick smiles back

Rick gestures at Nikolai and then to his gun George nods
He raises the gun aims it at Nikolais back and

The click noise causes Nikolai to turn around and see Rick
standing there George closes his eyes and shakes his head

look

RICK

GEORGE
Did you not see what was in there
Rick NOTHING All the people who
sacrificed their lives to protect

be standing right here right now

GEORGE
And thats a good thing

Rick kneels down and looks him in the eye
RICK

worlds highest-ranking and lethal
terrorists are about to show up
