Trouble in Paradise

SEQUENCE A
FADE IN NIGHT

MED SHOT DOOR OF A HOUSE
A cheap residential district The house has no architectural
character it is not certain where we are Near the entrance
door is a garbage can full

A dog is nibbling at some of the garbage We hear whistling
footsteps A garbage man comes into the picture He shoos
the dog away Without pause in whistling he lifts the
garbage can and followed by camera goes to the end of the
block which is only a few steps Now we discover we are in
Venice In the background is a major canal and a typical
bridge--romantic background Gondolas are passing In the
foreground at the sidewalk is the garbage gondola piled
high with garbage The man dumps his load leaves the empty
can on the sidewalk gets in the gondola and paddles away
with the grace of a gondolier Now in a beautiful tenor
voice which is quite a contrast to the garbage he starts
singing a passionate Italian love song

LONG SHOT A GONDOLA

Two tourists Husband and wife They are in a sentimental
embrace In back is the gondolier Camera follows gondola
a few seconds coming closer

ANOTHER GONDOLA

Camera shoots down Gondola is covered by a typical little
canopy so that gondolier cannot see the passengers Camera
cuts canopy on one side so that we dont see at first who
is paddling In the gondola seat is a woman in evening gown
lots of jewels She lies in the arms of the gondolier They
kiss Camera moves up and discovers who is paddling the
boat It is the husband of the lady who is having such a
good time with the gondolier Husband is in tuxedo and
straw hat smoking a long cigar He is enjoying it like a
child with a new toy

HUSBAND
Darling

WIFES VOICE
Yes sweetheart

HUSBAND
What a canal

SIDEWALK
in front of the hotel Camera shoots down from the hotel on
the sidewalk including part of sidewalk and canal The
water reflects the electric-lighted name of the hotel At
sidewalk is moored a gondola in which are four people A
man climbs out starts to sing the others in the gondola
playing accompaniment We hear a romantic Italian song
irresistible The four look up to the hotel windows
expecting coins

HOTEL ROOM INT

photographed against the open window In the background is
the canal Through the window we hear the street singers
Near the window is a table where five men are in a poker
game not listening to the music We hear over the music
the rattling of the chips After a few moments the noise of
the chips stops and the singing comes through more clearly
Casually one of the men cards in hand walks to the window
closes it and returns to game

ANOTHER HOTEL ROOM CLOSE SHOT

telephoning

WOMAN
Uh-huh Uh-huh

During the scene we hear the same street singers The woman
annoyed by the singing closes the window

are heard On the bed in the foreground is a woman lying
in her chemise and crying In the background sitting on
the arm of a chair which is by the open window is an
elegantly dressed man Evening clothes overcoat hat
walking stick Annoyed by the crying and by the outside
music he gets up and slams the window shut with a bang

FRANCOISS HOTEL ROOM MED SHOT

In the background is an open window with French doors
leading to a little balcony This room is on the other

side of the hotel looking out on a side canal Close
outside the window we see trees The same music is still
audible but much fainter Near the window is a desk The
drawer is open and all the papers are scattered on the
floor At the other side of the window is a trunk open
all the drawers out and the contents thrown around Room
looks as if it has been rifled For a little while we hear
nothing but the faint music Then we hear the door buzzer
There is no reaction The buzzer rings again Suddenly from
behind the camera a man comes into the picture He is ina
tuxedo His back is to the camera so we cannot identify
him He goes quickly to the window jumps from balcony to a
tree and climbing down disappears Buzzer rings again

Camera goes toward the tree to a very big close-up of a
little branch We see on this little branch a false
moustache We hear the man reach ground and receding
footsteps as he hurries away Again we hear a little
fainter the buzzer

EXTHOTEL MED SHOT

On wall in moonlight We see shadow of tree and of man as
he reaches the ground In silhouetted shadow we see him
take off moustache and sideburns and toss them out of the
picture

are two Italian dames obviously disreputable One is
pushing the buzzer They speak in Italian but their
emphasis and pantomime make the following clear to English-
speaking audiences Girl No 1 brought Girl No 2 to see the
gentleman of room 253 Girl No 1 rings again Girl No 2
complains to Girl No 1 that she should have known better
than to have brought her here and wasted her time Girl

to his feet But still under the influence of dope he
falls As he falls he drags with him from nearby little
table a tray with glasses making a loud noise

(The window frame in the following moving shot across
windows outside will be done with a miniature hotel
building)

Camera swings swiftly along the hotel front around the
corner of the hotel and up to the third floor It stops at
a little balcony Behind the balcony leaning against one
of two open French doors stands Gaston in a tuxedo
smoking a cigarette looking romantically into the night
We see in the room a waiter setting a dinner table for

GASTON

Eighteenth century

MARIETTE
(getting it impressed)
Yes

GASTON
Early eighteenth century I should
say around--seventeen thirty

MARIETTE
Right

GASTON
(examining headboard)
Beautiful specimen

MARIETTE
It is beautiful But I got a little
tired of sleeping in antiques so I
gave it to my secretary

GASTON
(specially interested as
he learns this is not
Mariettes room)
Oh
(He wants to hear more)

MARIETTE
This used to be my secretarys room

GASTON
(with affected nonchalance)
I see
(Going very close to
headboard touching woodwork
with expert hand)
She must have been very happy here

MARIETTE
(with a smile)
Too happy Thats why I discharged
her

GASTON
(his eye caught by carving
on one of the posts)
Isnt that wonderful
(He turns to Mariette)
You see madame--
(He stops noticing
something on the wall)

thousand francs--in your safe--at
home

MARIETTE
(worried)
You think thats too much

GASTON
(emphatically)
No Not enough
(With the air of a banker)
In times like these when everything
is uncertain every conservative
person should have a substantial
part of his fortune within arms
reach

MARIETTE
(nodding with the gravity
of a woman accepting her
bankers advice)
That sounds sensible
(She goes out of the picture
thinking it over)

Tell me Msieu Laval what else is
wrong

GASTON

were your father--
(with a smile)
which fortunately I am not--

MARIETTE
(coquettish)
Ye-es
GASTON
And you made any attempt to handle
your own business affairs I would
give you a good spanking--in a
business way of course

MARIETTE
(complete change of
expression businesslike)
What would you do if you were my

secretary

him in a guarded whisper about flirting He answers and
apparently says something that makes her laugh disarming

GIRON
(in a cutting voice)
Msieu Laval you seem to be
avoiding my questions

GASTON
And you Msieu Giron seem to be
disturbing my examination of this
report

GIRON
Examination Msieu Laval what are
you insinuating I have enjoyed the
confidence of this family for more
than forty years How long have you
enjoyed Madames confidence Three
weeks I believe

GASTON

Two weeks and three days

GIRON
(nastily)
Um-hum

GASTON
(very softly)
Are you insinuating anything Msieu
Giron

GIRON
(With equal softness
and a sudden smile)
No not at all

GASTON
(beaming)
Well thats fine Then you are not
insinuating that I am avoiding
questions And I am not insinuating
that you wont let me examine this
report

GIRON
(continuing the friendly
note with an innocent
chuckle)
I was only asking if you are related
to the Lavals of Marseilles

GASTON
(even more friendly)
And I was only asking you if you
would let me examine your report
without interruption

GIRON
(like a man about to
make a new friend)
I dont see why any man should get
excited when he is asked about his
hometown

GASTON
And I dont see any reason for any
man getting nervous when somebody
checks over the figures of his
report

GIRON

(sudden change enraged)

Are you insinuating that this is
not an honest report

GASTON
(With vigor)
I am only insinuating that you are
nervous

GIRON
(furious)
Nervous Why should I be nervous

GASTON
(With deadly sincerity)
I dont know Msieu Giron
Outraged Giron picks up the batch of papers shakes it in
Gastons face

GIRON
Are you trying to say that there
is anything in these figures to
make me nervous

Gaston pauses and we see his suspicion has become a
certainty

No not at all

Girons hand drops it in desk locks desk and puts key in
his pocket Giron is speechless frightened to his heels

jeweled pin on her bosom then her bracelets and rings

GASTON
(ironically)
It would be a terrible scandal

GASTON

Yes Giron Chairman of the board of
Colet and Company Honorary

eloquently says no)

register to keep out of jail But

another meaning)

DISSOLVE TO

INT TAXICAB MOVING AT NIGHT ALONG PARIS STREETS

Close shot of Gaston and Lily There is a strained silence
between them Gaston smiles toward her He is trying to

make up but she sits frozen He smiles again anticipating
the surprise he has in store for her He reaches for the
pearls in his pocket A look of dismay crosses his face--

the pearls are not there He looks in all his pockets cant
find them Suddenly with suspicion he looks sidelong at
Lily She responds to his look with a triumphant smile From
her bosom she brings forth the string of pearls and holds it
up He is amazed cant figure it out She reaches behind and
brings forth a handbag which we recognize as the one
originally stolen from Mariette and she drops the pearls
into the bag Gaston is now smiling with admiration yet he
looks sly As Lily drops in the pearls she glances into the
bag Her expression changes Something is missing She looks
suspiciously toward Gaston Nonchalantly he draws from his
inside breast pocket the precious bank notes and slips them
too into the bag They smile at each other Together forever
they embrace and kiss
FADE OUT

Trouble in Paradise

Most any place can seem to be a paradise

While you embrace just the one that you adore
There neednt be an apple tree with magic powers
You need no garden filled with flowers

To taste the thrill of sweet greed hours

Gentle perfume and cushions that are silk and soft
Two in the gloom that is silent but for sighs
Thats paradise while arms entwine and lips are kissing
But if theres something missing

That signifies

Trouble in paradise

Colet Colet Colet and Compagnie

Are makers of the best perfume

If you and your beloved cant agree
Permit us to suggest perfume

Cleopatra was a lovely tantalizer

But she did it with her little atomizer
Well make you smell like a rose

Every nose in Paris knows
