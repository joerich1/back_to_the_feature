and uncomfortable as they fan themselves

Delilah and Samuel arrive at the altar
MINISTER
Who gives this woman in marriage

SAMUEL

Samuel kisses Delilahs cheek puts her hand in Kelvins
He takes a seat next to Mirabelle

MINISTER
Dearly Beloved we are gathered
together here in the sight of God to
join together this Man and this Woman
in holy Matrimony If any man- or
woman- can show just cause why they
may not lawfully be joined together
let him- or her- now speak or forever
hold their peace

Marney has a COUGHING fit A murmur ripples through the
crowd Delilah scowls at her

CHUCK

BEST MAN
But hes standing all the way over
here

BUCK
Shut up

Kelvin and Delilah face each other

MINISTER
Kelvin wilt thou have this woman as
thy wedded wife to live together

her punch for a third time only this time Delilah trips on

her train and collapses She CLONKS her head on the stage

GUEST

Mirabelle faints Delilahs out like a light The Minister
stoops down to assist He peers up at Kelvin but hes gone

The bridegroom leaves with his entourage

Mirabelle holds smelling salts under Delilahs nose

DELILAH
(opens her eyes)
Yeckh what is that Get that thing

MIRABELLE
A little gratitude would be nice

Delilah sits up Nearly everyone has left It begins to
sink in The Wedding That Never Was

Charlene and Marney sit in the first row looking despondent
Samuel approaches Delilah kneels down next to her

SAMUEL
Are you alright Honeybee Let me
help you up

MIRABELLE
Leave her be She needs to do it
herself
Samuel backs off
DELILAH

(slowly stands)
What happened

MIRABELLE

left you The one wearing the tuxedo

DELILAH
Thanks Momma That helps

SAMUEL
I think Delilah could do without the
snide remarks right now

MIRABELLE
What do you know about it Do you
know what went into putting on this
wedding day

SAMUEL
I think I do I paid for it

MIRABELLE
Thats just marvelous And what did
I invest Nothing at all right
Only the fancy wedding invitations
and the registry and that Godforsaken
rehearsal dinner --

SAMUEL
I just think --

MIRABELLE
Those God-awful programs and the
fittings and the million alterations
on those bloody hoop skirts and the
guest list and the thank you cards --

SAMUEL
Dont you think --

MIRABELLE
And the photographer and the
videographer and the caterer and
the minister and the florist and
the band and that fat slob chauffeur
brother of yours AND a five thousand
dollar cake that nobody ate

SAMUEL
Yes but this wasnt Delilahs fault

Mirabelle huffs and storms off Samuel watches her leave
He takes a seat dizzy and disconcerted

Delilah turns to her sister and Marney

DELILAH
This isnt really happenin’ right

MARNEY

A hint of a smile appears on Charlenes face She looks
away trying to hide it

DELILAH

CHARLENE

DELILAH
Then why are you smilin

CHARLENE

Samuel gives her a pained look Delilah sits next to Marney

DELILAH

says

DELILAH

MARNEY
You could do that But thatll just

n battery Its not worth it

DELILAH
How could he do that to me

MARNEY
Honey men like Kelvin are a dime a
bakers dozen Crying over somebody
like that well thats just foolish
if you ask me You can do better

Delilah spies the wedding cake in the corner of the tent

MARNEY
I swear to you

Delilah charges at the cake like a belle out of hell She
flails at it stirring up a whirlwind of icing

DELILAH
(mocking Kelvin)
You been doin some thinkin huh
You couldnt think up a brain fart
Ill give you somethin to think
about

Strawberry mousse splatters all over her hoop skirt as she
punches away Samuel buries his head in his hands

Delilah snatches the figurine of Kelvin atop the cake and
flings it into the trees

DELILAH
Smallest pecker Ive ever seen

Marney raises her eyebrows confused by the comment Delilah
looks down at herself thoroughly covered in cake Perhaps
a moment of clarity Then shamelessly she licks herself

Mirabelle and Charlene pop back into the tent They get an
eyeful of Delilah going to town on the cake Her indulgence
verges on pornography

MIRABELLE
(aghast)
Oh my word

CHARLENE
(salivating)
Oh my word

INT MACINTOSH ESTATE - DELILAHS BEDROOM -- DAY

Delilah still in bed Pizza boxes have joined the empty
ice cream containers on the floor One box half-eaten
sits squarely on Delilahs wedding dress

Her alarm clock goes off Delilah flings it across the room
She returns her face to the pillow and shuts her eyes

Slowly her eyes open again They focus on a
FRAMED PICTURE

INT TANDYS KITCHEN -- DAY

Tandy sits at the table watching Good Mornin Savannah
She appears lost and disappointed Her breakfast untouched

INT ARENA - RING -- NIGHT

A sold-out CROWD looks on as Delilah battles GLADYS THE
GRAVEDIGGER 36 spiky blonde hair the bizarro Delilah

Delilah throws three lightning lefts- each of them strikes

Gladys returns fire with a straight right that clears
Delilahs sinuses She adjusts her headgear

A one-two combination from Delilah throttles Gladys but
shes late returning to guard and pays for it in spades

Delilahs rhythm turns haphazard again Gladys sees that
shes off balance and capitalizes with a mean left hook

The BELL Hank sets down a stool and goes to work applying
Vaseline Romeo waters down Delilah

HANK
Youre doin good youre doin good

ROMEO
Kick her ass Delilah This ones
got no sense of style whatsoever

Tandy takes her sweet time entering the ring

DELILAH

TANDY

What are you asking me for Dont

ass kicked Or do I need to draw
you a map

DELILAH
What am I doin wrong

TANDY
If you wanna forget everything we
talked about thats your business
Im not your boss and youre not my
secretary

The BELL

DELILAH
Whats with you

Coming full speed ahead is Gladys Right cross POW

Delilah falls back against the turnbuckle She bobs and
weaves like mad trying to evade the flurry of punches

Then Delilah GROWLS at Gladys Her opponent steps back
Delilah struts out of her corner like a cat on the prowl

Gladys swings and misses Another one misses Delilahs
full-on into her box step throwing rapid jabs as she goes

When Gladys tries for a right hook Delilah sidesteps When
she lunges forward Delilah drops back out of harms way

Just when Gladys thinks shes got a read on her Delilah
switches genders on her box step Not only does Gladys miss
but she leaves herself wide open Delilah CONNECTS with a
left hook that sends her opponent spiraling down to the mat

DELILAH
Oh my God

Outside the ring Romeo jumps up and down high-fives Hank

As the REFEREE counts Gladys slowly rises to her feet
Delilah beams with confidence swaggers as she throws
everything but the kitchen sink at her opponent Gladys
tries to shield herself from the barrage The BELL

Hank and Romeo storm the ring

HANK
I knew you could do it

ROMEO
(hugs Delilah)
She looked just like you Except
older fatter and on crack

DELILAH

He turns to face Abby raises his fists

Abby through his eyebrows An evil grin spreads out over
his face

They move in a circle Tommy throws a few weak punches
thinking it will intimidate Abby It doesnt

He decides to go for the stomach Mistake Abby catches
Tommy with an UPPERCUT that brings him to an upright position
This sets her up nicely for a ONE-TWO that drops him on his
ass The Buddies double over laughing

BUDDIES
(chanting)
ABBY

ABBY
Come on Get up Bubbalicious

Tommy is more staggered than hed like to admit He cant
quite make it to his feet

A final crowd-pleaser Abby reaches into her shirt and undoes
her bra The Buddies jump about like theyre auditioning
for Springer

Abby approaches Tommy from behind and manages to clasp the
bra around his enormous torso

ABBY
Youre gonna need a bigger cup size

She unloads a LEFT HOOK that spins her ex-fiancé like a top
Down to the mat The Fans GO NUTS
DELILAH
(standing over him)
Capeesh
A Trumpeter plays TAPS as the Referee counts down Kelvin
Hes OUT

Team Delilah rushes the ring

Charlene places a pageant tiara atop her sisters head

CHARLENE
No sense having it collect dust

They hug Samuel ruffles Delilahs hair

SAMUEL
Im proud of you

DELILAH
Thanks Daddy You too

Meanwhile Hank and Romeo stir the Fans into a frenzy
chanting DELILAH DELILAH Even Slice joins in

Delilah turns and Tandy KISSES her full on the lips

TANDY
I mean Congratulations
DELILAH
(blushes )

Thanks

As she waves to the crowd Nate and Abby enter the ring
Nate taps the Minister on the shoulder

Kelvin begins to snap out of it just in time to see Nate
get down on one knee in the center of the ring with mike in
hand The crowd goes APESHIT

It dawns on Delilah to turn around and see what all the hubbub
is about Her eyes POP

NATE
Miss Delilah will you marry me
(brandishes the ring)

DELILAH
DEED I WILL

Nate slides the engagement ring onto her

FINGER

It covers the mark left by the old one She beams
They kiss Confetti fills the air surrounding them
FADE OUT

THE END
