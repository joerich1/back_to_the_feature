EXT NEAR A MOON OF SATURN SPACE

Its war in space the way its really fought
silent flameless When a ship is hit

theres a brief flash of light and debris

sprays in all directions but thats all

Earths ships are blocky a ragtag thrown-
together jerry-built fleet that was assembled
in a panic after the brutal first encounter
The aliens did not try to communicate one
of their ships showed up and started scouring
the surface of the Earth When it was
finally brought down the aliens were found
to be about a meter in height bodies antlike
in structure but covered in fur to retain
body heat The scientists called them
Formicines the military calls them
Formics and everybody else calls them
Woolly Ants or Ants or Woollies or any
number of other names in other languages
They all mean the same thing The ones who
want to kill us the ones we have to kill

EXT FLAGSHIP SPACE

One of the few new sleek Earth ships

INT ADMIRALS BRIDGE

The busy headquarters of a computer-age war
Officers scurry on urgent errands most
wearing headsets with heads-up displays and
small one-handed computer keypads on their
belts like drive-up-window workers at
McDonalds

The center of the room is the Simulator a
three-dimensional representation of all the
ships that the computer is tracking Earth
ships are in bright green Formic ships are
in bright red Missiles and lasers are
represented in white dots and streaks
Admiral SAKATA a Japanese-American
with several aides and subordinates
including Commodore OCASEY stands
watching as the battle progresses

EXT NZF WAITANGI SPACE
A large contingent of retrofitted cargo ships

is hidden behind a moon of Saturn absolutely
still taking no part in the battle Then a

small port in the Waitangi opens anda
single missile fires

INT ADMIRALS BRIDGE

The Simulator shows a single white missile
coming from the group of reserve cargo ships
Sakata immediately notices it points

SAKATA
Who fired that missile

An AIDE punches something on his keyboard and
responds in only a second

AIDE
The Waitangi sir Captain Mazer
Rackham

SAKATA
I want his executive officer to
take command of the Waitangi and
put Rackham under arrest
immediately

OCASEY
I had Rackham in training He told
me once that a soldier should obey
not the words but the purpose of
the order

SAKATA
My purpose was to keep my reserves
concealed and he just revealed
their position

AIDE
His exec reports that as soon as he
fired that missile Rackham placed
himself under arrest

OCASEY
Thats Rackham

SAKATA
Were in combat Therell be no
trial He is to be executed as
soon as he can be transferred to
another ship

INTERCUT between simulator and actual ships
and missiles The single missile erupts into

twenty differently targeted

SAKATA (VO)
No He used a multi-warhead Why
didnt he just put up a neon sign

The warheads disperse We follow one which
goes for a while then suddenly changes
course and heads straight for a small
insignificant-looking Formic ship

The Formic ship continues to fire toward the
main Earth fleet never responding in any way
to the warhead coming up from behind The
warhead goes up the rocket nozzle

The Formic ship is silently obliterated One
moment its there the next its just
sparkling dust

All firing from all Formic ships stops
immediately

INT ADMIRALS BRIDGE

Admiral Sakata is the first to realize what
is happening He holds up one hand to
silence the buzz of conversation and points
at the display with the other

AIDE
Theyve stopped firing

OCASEY
Theyre not retreating either

Undefended now several more Formic ships
blow up

SAKATA (cont)
Cease firing Everybody

Several aides speak into their mouthpieces
and punch keys All firing stops from the
Earth fleet

SAKATA (cont)
I want a boarding party on one
Formic ship If its a trap be
prepared to blow the thing up

EXT FORMIC BATTLE CRUISER SPACE

A dozen Remora-class landing pods whirl
around the Formic cruiser and attach to it
INT REMORA LANDING POD

A dozen marines in space suits watch as a big
laser carves through the surface of the
Formic ship like butter When its
completely severed from the hull the disc
that was cut out flies up to attach to a
magnet on the drill The marines dive
headfirst through the hole weapons ready

INT FORMIC BATTLE CRUISER

The marines fire at the first few Formics
that they see but none of them fire back A
marine walks up to one sitting at a console
and shakes him The Formic topples over

INT ADMIRALS BRIDGE

Dr IMANUJAM in civilian clothes is
reporting to Admiral Sakata OCasey and
other top officers Aides watch nervously
occasionally responding softly to chatter on
their headsets

IMANUJAM
Some Formics were still alive but
they did not respond in any way
They all died within hours

SAKATA
What was it chicken pox

IMANUJAM
Our best guess is that the entire
hive was controlled by the will of
a queen When she was killed the
whole hive died

OCASEY
Dr Imanujam do you know when the
hive queen was killed

Imanujam leads them to the Simulator display
then turns to an assistant also in civilian
clothes

IMANUJAM
Play it back for them

We replay Rackhams missile killing the
Formic ship All Formic firing stops An
AIDE listens intently to headset
OCASEY
Looks like weve identified the
hero of our great victory sir
Unless hes already been shot

SAKATA
I dont care who plays the hero
We have to know how he figured out
which ship was the hive queen

AIDE
They want to know if Rackham is
still under arrest sir

SAKATA
Bring him here immediately

Sakata strides away from the group OCasey
follows talks privately to him

OCASEY
So What do you want to bet Mazer
Rackham is in command when the
Formics launch their next invasion

SAKATA
The nearest Formic planet is
thirty-five lightyears away The
commander of the human fleet in the
next invasion probably hasnt been
born yet

ESTABLISHING SHOT FUTURE GREENSBORO DAY

A swanlike shuttle glides high over the green
surface of Earth We drop down see a city
amid dense forest and patches of rolling
farmland a few high spires rising above
transparent domes We zoom close to a glass
bubble projecting from the tallest spire

INT CONFERENCE BUBBLE DAY

MR WIGGIN and MRS WIGGIN are
seated across a small table from Dr DELOGER
and two men in International Fleet (IF)
uniforms with no insignia of rank On the
other side of a glass partition CHILD PETER and CHILD VALENTINE are playing

DELOGER
Peter and Valentine scored among
the ten most talented children
weve ever seen

MR WIGGIN
So why did you reject them for
Battle School

DELOGER
Valentine is too compassionate for
command We dont believe she
could ever send men to die

MR WIGGIN (dryly)
Why do I suspect that isnt Peters
problem

DELOGER
It isnt bad that Peters
aggressive But hes also impatient
and ruthlessly ambitious He would
endanger the lives of his men

MR WIGGIN
Hes too naughty shes too nice

MRS WIGGIN
So youll leave us alone to raise
our family in peace

DELOGER
We want to give you a waiver to
have a third child

(Beat)
If you sign in advance that we get
him if he tests positive for us

MRS WIGGIN
But what if he turns out as
unsuitable as the other two

DELOGER
You raise three children in peace

The Wiggins turn to look at Child Peter and
Child Valentine just as Peter pushes
Valentine and knocks her down She doesnt
fight she just sits up and turns her back on
him He gives her another shove with his
foot then settles down to play with the toys
she had been playing with

DELOGER
Or at least as much peace as they
let you have

DeLoger pulls out various papers and puts
them in front of the Wiggins to sign

INT CLASSROOM DAY

ENDER WIGGIN sits at a desk ina
traditional classroom traditional except
that the teacher MISS PUMPHREY is
demonstrating a point about the pyramids by
peeling layers from a large hologram at the
front of the room Ender is the youngest and
smallest in the class by a couple of years

CLOSE on the back of Enders neck A tiny
red-blinking machine the monitor sits under
the hairline just to the right of the spine

A tiny folded note lands on Enders desk He
unfolds it

NOTE Hey Third Let me copy

Ender glances back at STILSON who threw
the note Stilson looks as innocent as can
be

Miss Pumphrey suddenly touches her ear
listens and walks to Enders desk where she
retrieves the note looks at it

PUMPHREY
Mr Stilson

Pumphrey is about to lecture him but
something in her earpiece interrupts her
She hands a hall pass to Ender

PUMPHREY
To the school doctor Apparently
Mr Wiggin youre having a medical
emergency

Ender gets up leaves

EXT BREEZEWAY DAY

All the classrooms open into a garden-like
breezeway As Ender passes GRAFF male and
ANDERSON female officers responsible for
Battle School are heard in voiceover

ANDERSON (VO)
What are you doing

GRAFF (VO)
Ender Wiggin is ready

INT SCHOOL MEDICAL CENTER DAY

THE MONITOR LADY greets Ender with a
phony medical smile as he enters

MONITOR LADY
Andrew I suppose by now youre
just absolutely sick of having that
horrid monitor Well I have good
news Its coming out today

Ender reaches up to touch the monitor

MONITOR LADY (cont)
It wont hurt a bit

THE DOCTOR enters all bustle and cheer

DOCTOR
Climb up and lie on your tummy

Ender climbs up on the examining table

DOCTOR (cont)
For a few days youll have a
feeling of something missing But
that feeling will quickly pass

He attaches the extractor a machine as big
as Enders head and flips it on It whirrs
as tiny metal arms and tentacles go out and
probe under the skin inside the bone
Suddenly Enders back arches his mouth agape
in agony Convulsions

DOCTOR
Get me the muscle relaxant

The monitor lady dives for a blackjack-like
injector already waiting on the counter The
doctor whacks it against Enders bare arm

In moments Ender goes still The doctor
affixes a bandaid to the back of his neck as
Ender wakes

MONITOR LADY
There now Andrew Are we all
right
Ender sits touches the bandaid at the back
of his neck

ENDER
Does this mean I failed

INT CLASSROOM DAY

Ender comes back into class Everyone is
taking a test at their desks Stilson
notices the bandaid the lack of a monitor
In a mock sports announcer voice he intones

STILSON
Third-boy strikes out

Ender doesnt turn around But everyone else
looks

EXT WIGGIN FRONT YARD DAY

In a row of smallish but well-kept-up houses
a large tree has scrap lumber nailed to it a
ladder up to a treehouse Ender carrying a
nearly-empty backpack trots along the
sidewalk and up the front walk toward the
door

ANDERSON (VO cont)
Colonel Graff it never works to
advance a child ahead of schedule

GRAFF (VO)
Have you ever tried it with Ender
Wiggin

ANDERSON (VO)
Battle School has been functioning
for more than forty years Youve
been in command less than a month

GRAFF (VO)
Is there a trial period
ANDERSON (VO)
No but theres a learning curve

Ender pauses at the corner of the house
peels the bandaid off his neck He walks
along the side of the house to the door and
goes inside

GRAFF (VO)
Do you know what orders I received
when I was made commander

ANDERSON (VO)
No sir

GRAFF (VO)
Then you dont know everything yet

PETER drops from the treehouse goes to
the bandaid picks it up grins Then he
drops the bandaid to the ground again and
grinds it savagely under the heel of his
shoe

INT WIGGIN KITCHEN DAY

VALENTINE is making cookies Ender
comes in and dips a finger into the batter
Valentine slaps at his hand but he gets a
taste into his mouth Then he grimaces

VALENTINE
Yeah well if youd asked I would
have told you its nothing but
sugar and shortening and eggs

Ender dips again methodically and this time
makes a show of savoring the dough

VALENTINE
Im going to puke

ENDER
Its a boy thing

VALENTINE
Its a perverted wacko circus geek

thing

Ender takes a bow to imaginary applause She
sees the back of his neck Touches the spot

ENDER
Oh yeah They bounced me today

She hugs him delighted
VALENTINE
Oh Ender Mom and Dad have been
so worried they were afraid they
were going to lose you

ENDER
(Bitterly)
So its a good thing I failed

VALENTINE
Let some other kid go up into space
and play army

PETER (OS)
So everybody guessed wrong about
Ender

Peter enters carrying a fearsome Formic
mask He smiles benignly

PETER (cont)
Now we can play together all the
time

Peter holds up the mask Ender tries to hide
his dread of whats coming

PETER (cont)
Lets play astronauts and formics
Since youre never going to be an
astronaut you have to be the
woolly ant

VALENTINE
Leave him alone

Peter sweeps the mixing bowl from the
counter spilling the dough out onto the
floor

PETER (mock friendly)
Valentine you silly goof you
better clean that up before Mom
gets home

Valentine tries to pretend its all a joke

VALENTINE
Just for that Peter no cookies
for you

PETER (savagely)
Theyre all for widdo Endo so him
doesnt feel so baddums about
getting bounced from the pwogwam

He grabs Ender by the hair and puts the mask
over his face

PETER (cont)
Look Hes so scary The monster

Ender tries to shove the mask away

ENDER
I dont want to play

Peter shoves him brutally across the room
Ender falls against the wall

PETER
You play whenever I say You got no
angels watching over you now

VALENTINE (yelling)
The whole time he wore that thing
you hated him because he still had
a chance Now hes out a loser
just like me Just like you

Peter bends down scoops up a double handful
of batter

PETER
And they said you were the nice

one

He smears it all over the front of
Valentines clothing

PETER (cont)
If hes not better than us hes
got no reason to exist
He turns to Ender pulls him to his feet and
drags him toward the stairs

INT ENDERS AND PETERS BEDROOM DAY

Peter shoves Ender into the room Ender rips
the mask off

PETER
Put it on

Ender frisbies the mask across the room

PETER (cont)
Just how stupid are you

He grabs Ender and drags him to the mask
PETER (cont)
Put it on

Valentine appears in the doorway as Ender
struggles to get free

VALENTINE
Im calling Mom

PETER
Tell her that Enders being a
disobedient little brat

Peter flips Ender onto his back presses a
knee into his belly Ender gasps struggles
like a bug on a pin

VALENTINE
Ill call Father

PETER
Hes never in

Peter presses harder Ender breathes in
short little gasps that dont get enough air

PETER (cont)
I could kill you like this

VALENTINE
Youre not a murderer

PETER
No Im an exterminator The law
is two children per family We
never needed him

VALENTINE
This isnt funny

PETER
You cant stop me from killing him

VALENTINE
Youd never get away with it

Enders hand reaches a softball lying on the
floor He smacks Peters head with it
Peter shrugs off the blow

PETER
Ill tell them I didnt mean to do
it Ill cry

Tears come to his eyes While still pressing
on Enders stomach he sobs absolutely
believably
PETER (cont)
I didnt know it would hurt him
He was laughing It was part of
the game I would never hurt
Ender I loved him so much

Its terrifying to Valentine how believable
he is

PETER (cont)
They were sure right about you
You wouldnt fight even to save
your baby brothers life

In reply Valentine kicks at Peters face
He lets go of Enders shoulders and catches
her foot twists her leg knocks her off her
feet

PETER (cont)
You are both so stupid

With his arms free Ender punches Peter

solidly in the groin Peter swings at Ender
Ender dodges As Peter writhes on the floor
in pain Ender grabs a baseball bat from the
floor and prepares to hit Peter in the head

ENDER
Dont make threats Peter It
gives the other guy a chance to
strike first

Valentine catches the end of the bat
stopping him

VALENTINE
No Ender

PETER
Do it Ender Beat me till my
brains splash out

Ender tugs at the bat

ENDER
Its him or me

VALENTINE
Hes your brother Ender

A voice from downstairs

Valentine rushes to the door

VALENTINE

Footsteps on the stairs Peter speaks
rapidly softly
PETER

Valentine When youve forgotten
all about this Therell be an
accident and well all cry me
loudest of all and then at the
grave youll remember today and
youll wonder for a minute and
then youll say No not Peter
Hes not a murderer

VALENTINE
If you hurt him Ill kill you

PETER
You My gentle sister Valentine

ENDER
Bullies like him are all cowards

Ender and Peter gaze steadily at each other
Both are expressionless Master chess
players assessing each other

Mr and Mrs Wiggin enter the room Mrs
Wiggin goes straight to Ender kneels scoops
him into a vast embrace Mr Wiggin lifts
the hair on the back of Enders neck looks
at the tiny mark

MR WIGGIN

INT WIGGIN FRONT ROOM DAY

Ender gets to the door as the bell rings
again He pulls it open Standing there is
GRAFF in full dress uniform a
recruiting poster with a Mona Lisa smile

GRAFF
Hello Ender

FADE TO
Mr and Mrs Wiggin sit on the sofa with
Ender between them There are tears on her
cheeks

MRS WIGGIN
We thought it was all over

GRAFF
Only the waiting is over

Mrs Wiggin turns her face away weeping
silently

MR WIGGIN
But hes barely nine years old

GRAFF
You agreed before he was born

ENDER
I didnt

GRAFF
Mr and Mrs Wiggin will you
excuse us please

It takes a moment to realize that he expects
them to go They rise and comfort each other
out the door

ENDER
Why did you let me think I failed

Graff ignores his question
GRAFF
Would you really have smashed in
your brothers head with that bat
ENDER
What answer will get me out of

Battle School

Graff leans close to him
GRAFF
Who stopped the formics when they
invaded fifty years ago

ENDER
Mazer Rackham

GRAFF
Where is he now

ENDER
Dead I guess

GRAFF
So wholl stop them next time

Enders defiance fades into serious thought

GRAFF (cont)
I hope we have the greatest
military commander the world has
ever known to outthink them
outfight them destroy them before
they scour humanity off the face of
the Earth

ENDER
Im just a kid

GRAFF
Whats inside you Ender What can
you become What if youre the
only hope

Ender studies Graffs face

ENDER
Do you say this to all the kids you
recruit

GRAFF
No I tell them not to come
Because theres no turning back
We take your childhood You might
never see your family again

(cont)

GRAFF (cont)
But if you come to Battle School
maybe youll have something to do
with keeping them alive

ENDER
I guess its what I was born for

Graff studies him a moment longer then
stands up

GRAFF
On your feet soldier

Ender stands up They face each other in
silence

EXT WIGGIN FRONT YARD DAY

The family all but Peter are kissing and
hugging Ender good-bye Graff stands beside
a limo at the curb watching

ANDERSON (0OS)
After growing up in that family
how stable is he going to be

Graff talks softly into a tiny palm-held
mouthpiece The other half of the phone is
worn like a hearing aid

GRAFF
Therapy is your job

Ender pulls away from his family heads down
the walk Graff holds out his hand Ender
reaches out at first like a child to hold
on then like an adult to shake hands

Graff clasps Enders hand when Valentine
bursts from the family group and runs partway
down the walk

VALENTINE
I love you forever Ender

Graff ushers Ender into the back seat of the
car and closes the door As Graff walks
around the car Peter drops down from the
treehouse and runs to the car window

ENDERS POV

Peter leans close to the glass staring at
Ender Ender stares back The car pulls
away Peter is left behind

ESTABLISHING SHOT SPACEPORT NIGHT

Several heavy cargo rockets and two passenger

shuttles on the tarmac The ground opens up
and spits out a hoverbus

EXT SHUTTLE NIGHT
The hoverbus rises thirty feet up to where
the horizontal-takeoff shuttle sits like a
plane on the tarmac A bridge appears in the
air between the doors of both a force field
you can stand on Children ages 11-13 file
across the bridge Ender crosses early
clearly the smallest of the children Soon
after him come SEBASTIAN (French 11) and

ALAI (Senegalese-French 11) (Though some
have accents all the children speak fluent
English)

ALAT

Just like on television

SEBASTIAN
Look theyre letting babies in

ALAT
No hes our instructor

They laugh

INT SHUTTLE CABIN NIGHT

Ender is coming up the center aisle Their
laughter rings in his ears Graff points to
his seat As Ender slides into place

ENDER
Youre coming with us

GRAFF
I have to or Ill lose my job

ENDER
What is your job

GRAFF
Commander of the Battle School
Think of me as the principal with
the power to shoot deserters

Graff goes back to pointing out seats to
students Ender identifies which harness
straps are his and fastens himself in
Sebastian and Alai end up in the next row
back

SEBASTIAN
Look Our instructor

He raps Ender on the head with his knuckle
Ender winces tries to duck away but the
harness wont let him

SEBASTIAN (cont)
Did you hear that Empty

He raps Ender again

SEBASTIAN (cont)
A church bell An empty bottle

Several other kids laugh nervously

SEBASTIAN (cont)
I know A septic tank

He raps again The laughter is more open
But Alai reaches out a hand as if to restrain
Sebastian The joke has gone on long enough
Sebastian shrugs him off

SEBASTIAN (cont)
Im only trying to get knowledge
out of the head of our instructor

GRAFF
Eyes front

At once the kids face Graff at the front of
the shuttle

GRAFF (cont)
I thought you were told to enter
the shuttle take the seat you were
given and strap in Why is it
that only Ender Wiggin the
youngest of all knows how to obey
an order

SEBASTIAN
(defensive)
I didnt think it was an order

Other kids nod murmur their agreement

GRAFF
What did you think it was

SEBASTIAN
An instruction

GRAFF
If youre really that dumb I wonder
how you find your butt to wipe it

Sebastians face reddens but he doesnt look
away

GRAFF (cont)
Youre in the IF now children
The International Fleet All
instructions are orders All
suggestions are orders All hints
and wishes and secret yearnings of
a superior are orders

SEBASTIAN
How do we know whos our superior

GRAFF
Every human being in the IF
uniform is superior to you

SEBASTIAN
Even if they

Graffs fingertips press against Sebastians
lips

GRAFF
The only appropriate answer when a
superior vilifies you is Yes sir
Or if youre really pissed off
you can add Thank you sir

He removes his fingers from Sebastians lips

SEBASTIAN
Yes sir Thank you sir

GRAFF
You can dish it out cant you
Sebastian But you cant take it

SEBASTIAN
I thank you sir

GRAFF
Little Ender Wiggin he can take it
without complaint Guess who looks
more like a soldier to me

Ender glances at Graff then looks straight
ahead furious

ENDER
(Quietly)
Thank you sir
Everyone is rocked backward as the shuttle

starts to move

EXT SHUTTLE NIGHT

The shuttle is towed to its starting place at
the end of the runway The engines are
fired

INT SHUTTLE NIGHT

The acceleration presses them back into their
seats

EXT SHUTTLE CHANGEOVER

The shuttle rises past the knife edge of the
Earths shadow and suddenly it is in bright
sunlight A huge fuel tank section peels off
the bottom of the shuttle Small rockets
maneuver the shuttle toward a high orbit

INT SHUTTLE SPACE

Graff walks down the aisle Some of the kids
are nauseated by weightlessness One starts
vomiting Graff helps him

The moment Graff is behind them Sebastian
tries to smack Enders head again The
harness restrains him He unfastens it
grips the back of Enders seat and raps the
top of his head but hard this time all his
anger and humiliation in it Ender recoils
in real pain

SEBASTIAN
I still say its empty

Alai grabs at Sebastians clothes as
Sebastian makes a fist and prepares to hammer
it into Enders face

Ender reaches upward grabs the hand that is
holding Sebastian in place and yanks forward
and down Propelled by Enders pull and his
own hammering motion Sebastian at once spins
upward ass-over-teakettle and yells in pain
as he bounces off the ceiling breaking his
arm

Graff arrives quickly snatches him deftly
out of the air

GRAFF
You unfastened your harness
soldier

Sebastians only answer is to yell again in
pain
GRAFF (cont)
Furthermore you attacked an enemy
without taking into account the
possibility that he might defend
himself Do you know what we call
commanders who do that

A Japanese kid nearby pipes up

SHEN
Stupid

GRAFF
We call them heroes On the
monuments over their graves

Graff lifts Sebastians writhing body up by
the good arm like a captured toad being shown
to a science class

GRAFF (cont)

Dont you get it yet Everybody on
this shuttle qualified as one of
the thirty or forty smartest kids
on Earth out of three hundred
million kids your age And who do
you think tested highest of all
Could it be the one whos entering
Battle School a year ahead of his
age group Could it be the one
that this bully decided to pick on

With his free hand Graff is pointing at
Ender Everyone looks at Ender with varying
degrees of loathing resentment jealousy or
awe Ender has no friends in this launch
group now and he knows it He looks away
lonely and afraid

EXT BATTLE SCHOOL STATION SPACE

Earth is moon-sized in the distance When
the shuttle spins in synch with the station
it is drawn inside

desq a flat computer with a holographic
display on its top surface When Ender
touches it words appear in the air above it

the back wall Shen comes walking up to
them

SEBASTIAN
What do you want thief

SHEN
Just that Im sorry I knew it was

Alai gives Shen a nod and a little salute
Shen walks away

Look Shen wiggles his butt like a
girl when he walks
Utterly mortified Shen hurries down the
aisle which only makes things worse
Everybody is looking at his butt

Ender sees whats happening then starts
typing on his desq

CLOSE ON SHEN

Shen reaches his bunk sits on it then
slides in keeping his butt out of view

Alai is struggling not to laugh as he
deadpans

ALAT

SEBASTIAN
Get away from my bunk Alai

ALAT

SEBASTIAN
Some friend you are

Sebastian walks away from him down the
aisle looking at each kid he passes daring

them to meet his gaze Most look away like
junior chimps submitting to the alpha male
But Ender meets his gaze without expression

SEBASTIAN (cont)
It wasnt enough you broke my arm

Sebastian shoves Ender rocking him back on
the bunk

SEBASTIAN (cont)
The most brilliant kid on Earth

Sebastian prepares throw a punch Alai
arrives in time to catch his arm

ALAT
You already got Graff and Dap on

Sebastian lets Alai drag him back to his own
bunk Shen comes to Enders bunk sits

INT OBSERVATION DECK DAY

Graff wearing an undershirt is seated at a
table cluttered with communications devices
papers his desq and whatever parts of his
uniform hes not wearing at the moment
including his shirt He is watching his
desq which is showing a brown bear standing
on a table before an evil-looking giant

INT LAUNCHIE BARRACKS DAY

Ender is playing the fantasy game on his
desq which shows the same scene

ENDERS DESQ

Ender-Bear is offered two drinks by the
giant

GIANT
Choose right and you wont die

Ender-Bear chooses the one that looks like
milk in a glass drinks it At once he turns
to powder and collapses in a pile as the
giant laughs

INT OBSERVATION DECK DAY

Graff shakes his head Ender-Bear arrives
again before the Giant who presents two
different drinks

GRAFFS DESQ

Ender-Bear chooses the steaming teacup and
drinks He bursts into flame as the giant
laughs A BUZZER sounds

WIDE

Graff looks up sees a light blinking beside
the door He puts a finger on an unmarked
spot on the table and the door opens
ANDERSON 30 a woman in a majors uniform
enters

GRAFF
What have I done now

She glances down at Graffs desq Ender-Bear
drinks from a loving cup inflates like a
balloon and pops

ANDERSON
Ender went straight to the giants
drink didnt he

At once the giant offers another choice
Ender-Bear drinks a green liquid and turns to
stone The giant picks him up and crushes him
to gravel in his fist

GRAFF
It took him maybe five minutes

ANDERSON
Has he done anything else

GRAFF
How many ways can one bear die

ANDERSON
Its a sign of despair
Loneliness Self-destructive
tendencies The giants drink is a
marker for attempted suicide

GRAFF
You dont make a great commander by
coddling him
ANDERSON
Is there some scientific basis for
this special training program
youre creating for Ender Or are
you just pulling wings off
flies to see what they do

Annoyed Graff looks back down at his desq
Ender-Bear has turned into a fly and is
swatted by a giant flyswatter

ANDERSON (cont)
Ouch

Graff drums his fingers on the table She
leaves

INT LAUNCHIE BARRACKS FLASH SUIT MONTAGE

A cart filled with flash suits bursts through
the door

Flash suits are tossed into the arms of the
kids

Straps are tightened around arms legs
torsos Helmets go on heads boots on feet
gloves on hands

The dao or lightgun does not look like an
assault weapon It slides onto the back of
the hand with a cord running into the
control unit that nests in the fingers We
see daos being slid into their slots fingers
closing over the controls and test shots
being fired only faintly visible in the
bright light of the barracks

dao Vietnamese for weapon

All the launchies are lined up daos on their
favored hand (ten percent of them are on left
hands instead of right) They break into a
simultaneous jog

INT CORRIDOR DAY

Dap stands beside the door The line of
armed launchies emerges Ender is shorter
than the others Sebastians arm is ina

cast the sleeve cut from his flashsuit

INT LAUNCHIE BATTLEROOM ENTRANCE DAY
The launchie line reaches the end of a
corridor The end wall is a forcefield
steely brown but with continuous swirling
and deforming of subtle colors in mandelbrot
patterns Then when Dap presses a button on
his hook the door dilates instantaneously
Inside is a large space dimly lighted

DAP
Welcome to the battleroom
children

INT BATTLEROOM NIGHT

The children enter gingerly becoming
weightless the moment they pass the
threshold They cling to handholds and move
hand-over-hand along the wall near the
floor trying to keep their body movements
under control Legs are useless

DAP (VO)
The moment you enter the battleroom
youre in freefall There are
handholds on all the walls
including the floor and ceiling

NEAR ENDER

Ender lets go with one hand Still clinging
to a handhold with the other he pushes off
with his feet Immediately he flips around
the fulcrum of the handhold and his body
smacks into the wall Shen is amused

SHEN
What are you trying to do kill
yourself

ENDER
Try it The suit keeps you from
hurting yourself and you can
control your bouncing with your
legs like this

Ender flips himself over again and again
with amazing rapidity That annoys Shen who
immediately flips himself just like Ender

but too hard He bounces back yelping

Ender gets his legs under him and squats over
a handhold as if he were trying to lift the
wall hes standing on Then he pushes off
launching himself across the room

WIDE
Ender flies across the room He tries to
catch himself against the other wall but
theres no way he rebounds at an oblique
angle At the next wall he catches himself

NEAR ALAT

Alai and Sebastian gather themselves for a
leap

NEAR SHEN

Shen seeing them launches first but
clumsily

WIDE

Three more kids fly across the room in three
random directions

DAP (VO)
Battle School is centered around
the war games in the battleroom
When you graduate from launchie
barracks you will be assigned to
an army

During the voiceover we see kids collide in
midair spinning off crazily Some try
gymnastic moves One kid throws up When
they get flashed by a dao their arms or legs
or whole bodies freeze in awkward positions
the lights on the suits going dark in the
area where they were shot

DAP (VO)
Someday you might even command one

NEAR ENDER

Ender glides quickly along the wall
handhold-to-handhold Shen follows till he
sees that theyre heading toward Alai and
Sebastian

SHEN
What are you doing They hate us

ENDER
The formics are the only enemy

SEBASTIAN
Look Its God and his favorite
butt

ENDER
What happens if four guys are out
in the middle and they push off
from each other

ALAT
I dont know

ENDER
(grinning)
Neither do I

ALAT
Lets find out

Alai grabs Sebastians good arm pulling him
away from his handhold With his other hand
he grasps Ender and Ender seizes Shen

ALAT

(To Ender)
So we all put our feet together and
push off

ENDER
One guy pushes off from the other
three Sebastian

ALAT
Youre smallest Youll go faster

ENDER
Sebastian is strongest

Sebastian gets foot-to-foot with the other
three holding on to their feet with his good
hand Then he pushes off They move a
little but he rockets away at nearly full
speed

ALAT
Salaam Ender

INT CORRIDOR DAY

The launchies pour out of the battleroom
running along the corridor Ender Alai
Shen and Sebastian come out as a foursome
running down the corridor like Ben-Hurs
chariot horses When Alai jumps up to touch
the ceiling the others do it too Ender is
too short to touch it trying too hard he
falls in a heap The others laugh but
Sebastian and Alai drag him to his feet and
bring him along
FANTASY GAME

Ender-Bear stands before the giant He
drinks from an eyedropper His fur falls
off Then his skin sloughs off exposing
bloody muscle

GRAFF (VO)
Who programmed the game to do that

ANDERSON (VO)
The game is self-altering

The muscles peel off revealing the skeleton
The organs spill out of the belly

GRAFF (VO)
Why were those images in the game

The bones separate and fall into a pile

ANDERSON (VO)
A biology animation The fantasy
game can pull anything from the
system

Ender-Bear drinks from a demitasse He turns
into a fish and the giant guts and debones
him

GRAFF (VO)
Sick

ANDERSON (VO)
The game Or the child

Ender-Bear stands before the giant again
But he does not drink Instead he kicks
over one glass Then the other The giant
starts pounding the table with his fists
trying to crush Ender-Bear

ANDERSON (cont VO)
Hes not trying anything that
hasnt been done before

Ender-Bear leaps up onto the giants beard
For a moment the giants animation freezes
while Ender-Bear continues to climb up onto
the giants face

GRAFF (VO)
Has anybody tried this

ANDERSON (VO)
It wont work Thats what its
for To see how soon they learn to
cut their losses and move on

Ender-Bear plunges his paw into the giants
eye and burrows in flinging out eye-stuff
like cottage cheese The giant waves its
hands ineffectually then opens its mouth in
a silent scream and keels over backward

ANDERSON (VO)
This violates the whole purpose of
the giants drink

INT LAUNCHIE BARRACKS NIGHT

Ender is the only one awake in the darkness
He sits on his bunk hunched over his desq
The giant is lying on its back Ender is
sweating panting as if he has just finished
a race

GRAFF (VO)
Surprise surprise The games
supposed to break Ender but Ender
broke the game What happens now

ANDERSON (VO)
(shaken)
I have no idea

In the game on Enders lap Ender-Bear climbs
out of the giants eye He turns toward the
giants ruined face

ENDER
Im sorry

FANTASY GAME

Ender-Bear looks around The giants corpse
lies on its back in a meadow surrounded by
forest

ENDER (VO)
I didnt mean to kill you I just
you wouldnt let me by

A bat flies up lands on the giants nose
GAME BAT
How did you get here Nobody comes

here

ENDER (VO)
I killed the giant
The bat flies up and away

GAME BAT
Welcome to Fairyland

Ender-Bear comes upon a playground in the
woods with children swinging and sliding and
climbing the monkey bars Ender-Bear tries to
join in the game The children see him
point at him start to shout

GAME CHILDREN
A bear A bear

The children all run to the edge of the
woods Ender-Bear is left alone Then one
by one the children transform into huge
wolves that slink around the edges of the
playground Ender-Bear tries to move off in
another direction But he is surrounded
The wolves leap on him

INT LAUNCHIE BARRACKS NIGHT

Ender slams his hand down in the middle of
the desq The game goes away He is
trembling as he puts the desq away

GRAFF (VO)
I thought this game was supposed to
help the kids

ANDERSON (VO)
It isnt therapeutic its
diagnostic

Ender throws himself back onto his pillow and
lies there staring at the ceiling clenching
and unclenching his fists

INT ANDERSONS QUARTERS NIGHT

Andersons quarters are designed to do double
duty as office and berth She sits on her
bed and Graff sits in the guest chair both
hunched over Andersons desq on a small table
between them replaying the game

GRAFF
So whats the diagnosis

ANDERSON
Theres no literature on this It
never happened before
GRAFF
Something you dont understand

ANDERSON
And that makes you happy

GRAFF
You never understood Im happy
you finally realize it

Anderson blows up

ANDERSON
I have always understood more than
you Youre so busy training the
commander that you dont realize
what youre doing to the child

GRAFF
Hes smarter than any of the people
who made up this Battle School He
sees right through your plans The
only way to stay ahead of him is to
take blind leaps into the dark

ANDERSON
Thats not science

GRAFF
Thats right Science deals with
laws with generalities Were
trying to create an exception

ANDERSON
Why Science works

GRAFF
I hope youre wrong because
science tells us we have no chance
of beating the formics in the end

Anderson is stunned

GRAFF (cont)
Of course that information is so
classified that if you even think
it in front of someone else you
could be shot

(beat)
I wish youd stop fighting me
Major Anderson I wish youd help

Graff leaves Anderson hugs her knees
thinking

INT LAUNCHIE BARRACKS NIGHT

Ender is asleep a child after all one fist
clenched up near his face

Dap comes and stands by his bunk in the
darkness Wakes him gently Hands hima
uniform Blinking Ender gets up looks at
the uniform realizes what it means

ENDER
What about Alai Shen Sebastian

Dap puts a finger to his lips

DAP
Each in his own time

Ender starts to dress full of misgivings

INT SALAMANDER BARRACKS DAY

The soldiers of Salamander army are just
getting dressed Some of them are still in
bed Its a sloppy barracks And not a
happy one BONZO sits on the first bunk
by the door surrounded by soldiers

The door opens Ender stands there in
Salamander uniform

BONZO
Por todos los santos

PETRA ARKANIAN a girl with close-
cropped hair and no sign of puberty steps in
front of Ender

PETRA
How did you get a Salamander Army
uniform

Ender holds up a piece of paper

ENDER
Orders

Petra reaches for them Ender holds them
back
ENDER (cont)
Im supposed to give them to Bonzo

Madrid

The room falls silent
PETRA
Not BAHN-zo BONE-so Aqui
hablamos espaxol

ENDER
Are you BONE-so

Some nervous laughter from other kids

PETRA
Im Petra Arkanian The only girl
in Salamander Army With more
balls than any boy in the barracks

This is greeted with hoots of derision
Bonzo comes up behind Petra pushes her
contemptuously out of the way and reaches
for the order slip

BONZO
What are they doing to me
L grimas de Cristo Mboto

MBOTO a lanky African kid slides off his
upper bunk

MBOTO
Sir

BONZO
Theyve transferred you to Eagle
and this is your replacement

Mboto tousles Enders hair and chuckles

MBOTO
Good luck

Without a backward glance Mboto leaves

BONZO
How old are you

ENDER
Nine

BONZO
Youre not even supposed to be in
Battle School

PETRA
He mustve got lost on his way to
ground school

BONZO
Calla-te Putra
(To Ender)
I dont know what the teachers
think theyre doing but Im not
going to keep you Im trading you
as fast as I can even though Ill
probably have to trade away a good
soldier to do it

ENDER
What do I do in the meantime

BONZO
Nothing You understand me Just
stay out of the way

ENDER
But I can train with you right

BONZO
I said nothing Nada Compreende

ENDER
Yes sir

BONZO
You sleep in the back You stay
out of my sight I deserve more
respect than to have them send me a
soldier like you

PETRA
Maybe its an honor Maybe they
thought you were the best commander
to train an underage kid

BONZO

(to Petra)
Ive already tried to trade you
away but nobody wanted you

PETRA
You couldnt train anybody

Bonzo slaps her across the face Petra
glares at him

BONZO
You going to report me

She sullenly shakes her head Bonzo turns
Ender

BONZO
Last bunk on the left You dont
use your desq You dont wear your
flash suit You dont exist

to
Ender walks down the long aisle between
bunks The soldiers stare at him or look
away
