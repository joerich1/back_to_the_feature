down the sidewalk carrying a paper bag The streets are wet
and empty We turns up an alley and midway through knocks on
a door We see the peep hole open An eye looks straight out
and squints with bewilderment then looks down and sees the
young boy The peep hole shuts and the door opens The boy

at him with an unpleasant scowl

The boy makes his way through the dark where some men pass by
arguing An overweight hooker sits on a stool chewing gum and
staring at the boy A drunk man is asleep and snoring quite

walks into a small smoke-flilled room

QUICK
Besides leaving New York shauld
be a last resort I aint afraid
