OVER BLACK we hear the sounds of a TURNTABLE turning on
We hear a NEEDLE drop The record plays a SONG

The SONG is pure innocent and simple the kind of
thing great singer-songwriters are made of

TEXT

“The following is kind-of based on a true story a little
bit”

The words are lifted away in a haze of CIGARETTE SMOKE

INT CHIME IN MAGAZINE OFFICES - DAY We listen to the song as we pick up snapshots from an
office of an early 70’s music magazine

- Cigarettes are smoked indoors everywhere Smoke wafts
over cubicles everywhere

- Women wear mini-skirts Really “mini” mini-skirts

- Music POSTERS and SIGNAGE line cubicle walls Hendrix
Dylan Simon and a Jew-fro’d Garfunkel

- A poster of a young RICHARD NIXON Someone has drawn a
MUSTACHE on Nixon’s face as well as a “SPEECH BUBBLE”
which reads “I’m an asshole”

- We hone in on a SINGLE CIGARETTE A hand places it in
an ASHTRAY The now-empty hand removes the needle from
the record player (stopping the song)

VOICE (0S)
Well it’s a hell of an albun
Kid People are gonna freak

The album goes into a SLEEVE and gets placed on a table
The album’s cover bears only a simple title Danny
Collins

The cigarette gets picked back up and the “voice” takes
his place behind a desk His other hand picks up a
DICTAPHONE
VOICE (0S) (CONTD)
(re recording)
This cool

SECOND VOICE (0S)
Sure

He hits RECORD A PACK OF CIGARETTES are held forward

( )

VOICE (0S)
Smoke

SECOND VOICE (0S)
No thanks

The pack is pulled back REVEALING for the first time
OUR INTERVIEWER GUY DELOACH His style is of the
day and his manner that of a hippie who thinks he knows

everything about anything worth knowing

DeLoach leans back in his seat He takes a long drag on
his cigarette as he studies the YOUNG MAN opposite him

ON THIS YOUNG MAN
Throughout we see him only in FACELESS SNAPSHOTS

- Long hair very much of the era

Open collared shirt A hairless chest
- A single gold cross on the hairless chest

- Those few facial features we can make out are boyish
untouched by well anything

DELOACH
Jesus H you’re a baby What are
you sixteen

YOUNG MAN
Twenty-one

DELOACH
Jesus H
(beat then)
Well the album’s gonna be massive
Kid Who got you there

YOUNG MAN
I’m sorry

DELOACH
Your influences Who do you dig
Who makes you hard

YOUNG MAN
(uncomfortable)
Oh well I--
DELOACH
Hold on

DeLoach picks up the recorder speaks into it
( )

DELOACH (CONTD)
June 30th 1971 Guy DeLoach with
Danny Collins for Chime Mag
(then)
More than anything it’s your
writing You write like fucking
Lennon man

DANNY
Oh well that’s thank you
DELOACH
He’s clearly an influence here
no
DANNY

Yeah I mean I guess he’s the
one who makes me the hardest

A beat DeLoach LAUGHS shakes his head

DELOACH
Jesus H Well you’re going to be
huge Kid I know the real thing
when I hear it and you’re it

Danny doesn’t say anything DeLoach raises a brow

DELOACH (CONT’D)
Kid look at me I’ve been a star-
maker and a star-fucker for a very
long time and I’m telling you
You Are Going To Be
Huge Richer than richer famous
as shit more women than you know
what to do with And I’m telling
you this and I’ve got to ask why
are you sitting there staring at
me looking like that information
scares the living shit out of you

Danny leans forward full-frame for the first time

DANNY
Because it does

YEARS LATER
EXT THE GREEK - EVENING 3

The large marquee outside the famous theatre bears only
four words

Danny Collins Sold Out

OMITTED 4

INT BACKSTAGE - MEANWHILE 5
A sign on the dressing room door reads HEADLINER In

the distance we hear a dull thumping ROAR THUMP

THUMP THUMP A distant crowd awaits their star

INT DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 6

A HAND fingers a CROSS

The cross dangles from a chain half buried in a patch of
gray chest hair The cross is removed placed on a table

The cross OPENS like a coffin and dumps a line of
COCAINE on a table

A NOSE comes into frame snorts some

AT THE MIRROR

Preparation for show time

- GRAY HAIR STRANDS are darkened with HAIR COLORER

- A GIRDLE is strapped over an undershirt

- PLATFORM SHOES are stepped into providing an extra
five inches of height

INT TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER 7
From behind we TRACK our hero as he marches through the
bowels of the arena in his platform shoes - his steps are
wobbly not exactly in a straight line

He passes some GIGGLING GIRLS nods at them He passes a
few “backstage” types including a familiar ROADIE

ROADIE
Break a leg Danny

( )

DANNY
(from behind)
Just tell me whose

The Roadie LAUGHS as Danny moves on The CHANTING CROWD
grows closer

AT THE STAGE CURTAINDOOR

From behind we watch as he pauses One deep breath
One crack of the neck each way Then

He gives a THUMBS UP to someone off to the side The
curtaindoor opens as he steps out onto the stage in
front of 20000 adoring fans

Needless to say they go completely bat-shit

ON STAGE

We stay behind Danny as he strolls forward takes the
mic and greets his fans

DANNY
Thanks for coming Los Angeles
It’s good to be home
The crowd ROARS approval

DANNY (CONTD)
I think you might know this one

Danny turns to his BAND NODS and

LIGHTS BLAST ON Everywhere The crowd ERUPTS

Our CAMERA SWEEPS over the crowd revealing in full
DANNY COLLINS for the first time since he was twenty-one

He’s still a striking man but the years have definitely
left their mark

He wears an impeccably tailored but boldly colored
outfit And those platform shoes Equal parts Rod
Stewart and Neil Diamond

There are instruments everywhere but Danny’s not
playing any of them

This is over-the-top spectacle but not caricature
The music the act it’s cheesy without being cartoony
campy without being completely void of melody

It’s pretty clear that the stadium isn’t the only thing
that has sold out

( )

Danny has clearly led off with his biggest hit akin to
Sweet Caroline (equally catchy almost as good) Sweet
Caroline is a good reference actually mainly because
from the first note (and especially the chorus) the
audience is SINGING ALONG in a call and response fashion
(TWO VIDEO SCREENS even cue the audience to sing their
part with bouncing-ball karaoke-esque prompts)

The CROWD (older) eats it all up A WOMAN sings his
chorus “Hey Baby Doll” while also wearing a “Hey Baby
Doll” T-shirt ANOTHER WOMAN holds up a sign that reads
“This Granny Loves Danny”

ON DANNY

During the song he mingles with women in the front row -
he kisses one woman’s hand blows a kiss to another He
makes a show out of giving one woman his SCARF

Danny takes in

THE CROWD

AN OLDER COUPLE arm and arm SING the response part of
the song back at him They’re singing way too hard

THREE OLDER WOMEN sit quietly in their front row seats
eating RED VINES and mouthing words along lifeless

A GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE sings along with energy but
they’re LAUGHING They’re not laughing with Danny

ON DANNY

He’s seen it all a thousand times It no longer fazes
him

He pivots with a little shimmy keeps performing

INT DRESSING ROOM - HOURS LATER

Danny SLUMPS in a chair his dressing room has
transformed into the site of an after-party Danny
fingers an expensive scotch (and his cross) as he does
his best to stay awake

TIM a thirty-something comes into view through Danny’s
scotch glass

TIM
Mr Collins do you think I could
bother you for a quick picture
(before Danny can
answer )
Just real quick my mom will die--

TIM (CONTD)

Tim the cell-phone-photo-seeker takes his leave Frank
shakes his head walks over to Danny

FRANK
It was a good show Kid

DANNY

Frank tilts his head takes Danny in

FRANK
Hey Sylvia Plath You okay

DANNY

That’s all Frank needs to hear He stands

FRANK
Alright everyone sorry but my guy
needs a little rest

No one really listens

FRANK (CONTD)
LISTEN UP YOU LEECHES IT’S TIME
TO GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE

DANNY
Frank let ‘em be--

FRANK
No Danny I can name three people
in this room and that’s about
three more than you can
(to room)
DID I STAMMER I SAID GET THE FUCK
OUT

The mumbling crowd begins dispersing Once they’re gone
Danny and Frank sit in silence for a moment Then

FRANK (CONTD)
Birthday’s not till tomorrow Kid
Got a few hours till the state
mandated depression has to set in

( )

This hangs

Danny nods

DANNY
You see the Golden Girls sitting
in the front row Eating
liquorice the entire time

FRANK
Can’t choose your fans Danny

DANNY
Three of them Each of them older
than the next Made one pack of
liquorice last the entire show
Just sat there gumming it for two
hours

there Frank tries cheering him up

FRANK
New billboard went up on Sunset
for the album You should check
it out on the way home

Staring off into space Frank STANDS

FRANK (CONTD)
Alright enough of this crap

It’s your birthday tomorrow
that’s your big problem Pregnant
women in Africa feeding half
their village from their
titties those ladies have
problems Not you

Danny smiles weakly

He stands

DANNY
No I know You’re right

FRANK
‘Course I’m right I’m always
right So go home to your
stunning half-your-age fiancé
who’s throwing you the massive
surprise party tomorrow that I
didn’t just tell you about Then
come tell me and the sore tittied
African ladies about all your
problems

DANNY
Okay

goes to exit Frank’s voice stops him
FRANK

It was a good show Kid Really
( )

Danny turns about to say something then thinks better
of it He simply replies

DANNY
Yeah

CUE SONG Working Class Hero (TBD) by John Lennon

IE DANNYS MERCEDES - LATER

It’s a preposterous car for anyone let alone a man in
his sixties Silver on the outside leather everywhere
on the inside it’s a spaceship on wheels

Inside Danny exhausted does everything he can to keep
his eyes from closing as he navigates Los Angeles
traffic

INT DANNY’S MERCEDES - LATER

Danny eases the car up to the GATE of a MANSION He
tries using his “clicker” It doesn’t work He SIGHS
TOOTS the horn

In the booth of the guardhouse stands a DOORMAN
currently talking on a HOUSE PHONE This is MARTY
(40s) Marty holds up a finger (Be with you ina
second”)

Danny parks waits After a beat Marty hangs up and
approaches Danny SIGHS lowers the window

MARTY
We gotta get that fixed for you
Mr Collins Good show tonight

DANNY
It was thanks

MARTY
Calling it early No after-party

DANNY
Little tired Just looking to hit
the sack so

He motions at the gate Marty doesn’t take the hint

MARTY

DANNY
Same as always
(then)
(MORE) ( )

11
DANNY (CONTD)
I really gotta hit the sheets
Kid
Marty nods

MARTY
Have a good night Mr Collins

Marty walks toward the gate hits a BUTTON It opens
revealing SHANGRI-LA Is this a home or a “Four

Seasons” Danny literally has to cross a “bridge” to get

to his home

INT MANSION FOYER - MOMENTS LATER 12
Danny ENTERS the house

DANNY
I’m home

No response Danny heads toward the tall staircase
looks at it SIGHS - then turns around and gets in

An ELEVATOR which carries him upwards

OMITTED 13

INT MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 14
A bed fit for a king Fireplace Huge flat-screen

DANNY
Babe

VOICE (0S)
I’m in the shower

Danny walks into

INT MASTER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 15
A female figure (masked by steam) showers The shower is
roughly the size of Rhode Island Danny walks past the

Danny heads into his ADJACENT WALK-IN CLOSET (filled to

the brim with high-end men’s clothing in bold patterns)

and begins hanging his jacket He calls back

DANNY (CONTD)

SHOWERING WOMAN

( )

ll 15

DANNY
Always doing busywork

SHOWERING WOMAN
It’s a big house Running it
keeps a girl busy
(then)
Ill be out in a minute I’m just
finishing shaving

DANNY
Okay
(then realizing)
Oh Hon

Danny turns back toward the shower The door to the
shower opens revealing

SOPHIE She’s Danny’s fiancé She’s very young
very hot and very naked

And she’s currently shaving her pubic hair with a
disposable pink razor (shaving cream covers the region)

DANNY (CONTD)
Jesus Sophie

SOPHIE
What

He shakes his head thrown by the sight and turns to go
Then he stops remembering

DANNY
Oh yeah the kid out front can
you do something about him I
don’t need a half hour of chitchat
every time I pull into my house

SOPHIE

He’s just trying to impress you
DANNY

Yeah well he’s failing

(then)
Okay I’m gonna go write

SOPHIE
Okay Baby
(then realizing)
Wait write who

DANNY
Just Sophie please watch what

(MORE) ( ) 15
DANNY (CONTD)
(then)
Don’t wait up alright

He EXITS the bathroom She calls after him

SOPHIE
Seriously Baby Who are you
writing

No reply Sophie SHRUGS continues her grooming

INT DANNY’S HOME STUDIO - LATER 16

It’s a great space A PIANO sits dead center It’s
obvious however that the room is not used often

ON THE WALLS

Covered in PLATINUM ALBUMS and framed copies of Danny’s
records The cover art on the albums tells a story -
from that first SIMPLE ALBUM to the “look” he’s developed
over the past decade or two (same typeface posing
etc)

Danny ENTERS the room looks around and spots what he’s
looking for a BOX OF EMBOSSED STATIONARY PAPER He
carefully opens the box Grabs a sheet It’s blank
They’re all blank

He looks until he finds a fancy MONTBLANC-esque pen
He takes it out looks at it sits at the piano and takes
his time perfectly setting the pen and paper into
“writing position”

Danny begins playing a simple melody A few chords The
beginning of something simple melodic and gentle

He pauses puts on his glasses Thinks for a beat
then smiles He grabs his pen and just then

Catches sight of himself in the studio mirror

ON HIS REFLECTION

An old man in a silly suit wearing platform shoes and
reading glasses trying to write something original after
what’s clearly been a long hiatus from just that

ON DANNY

Realizing He stops unwilling to go further You can
see it in his eyes What’s the point He puts down the

pen leans back and closes his eyes

He falls asleep sitting up

INT DANNY’S MERCEDES (IN FRONT OF MANSION) - NEXT DAY 17

Danny pulls up to the house Sophie holds leftovers in
her lap she’s dressed in something super revealing
Danny wears something that makes him look like a mid-60’s

pimp
You can imagine the looks they got at the restaurant

SOPHIE
Good birthday brunch Baby

DANNY
(nodding)
Good birthday brunch

She kisses his cheek He smiles at her

DANNY (CONT’D)
So how many people are inside

SOPHIE
Dammit Fucking Frank

Danny SIGHS
DANNY
Honey you can’t surprise a man my
age You want to give me a heart
attack or something

She motions at her ring finger

SOPHIE

DANNY

SOPHIE

Sophie reaches into her purse pours a line of coke on
the dash bends forward and does some

SOPHIE (CONT’D)

Danny EXITS the car

FROM OUTSIDE THE CAR

Danny heads toward the house We hold there a beat then
Sophie exits the car and scampers after him (attempting

to fix her dress as she scampers)

INT MANSION - MOMENTS LATER 18
They ENTER the house to a huge

CROWD
Surprise

The main living area is full of GUESTS Danny feigns
shock looks to Frank front and center Frank motions
to him “act surprised”

DANNY
No way Are you kidding me
(to Sophie)

You did this

But Sophie’s already hopped up barely listening rubbing
her nose and sniffling Danny covers her behavior by
hugging her The CROWD AWWWWES

DANNY (CONTD)
(putting on a show)
Don’t you all know you don’t
surprise a man my age You could
have given me a heart attack

Everyone LAUGHS Someone CUES Danny’s MOST FAMOUS SONG
(the one we saw him open the concert with)

DANNY (CONTD)
I think I know this one

LAUGHTER Danny couldn’t be more miserable but he’s had
decades of experience performing And boy can he
perform As WELL-WISHERS descend on Danny we launch

14a

INT MANSION - LATER

A PARTY MONTAGE (CUE SONG TBD John Lennon’s “Whatever
Gets You Through The Night”)

( )

19

As Danny goes through the motions in snapshots

- He watches OLDER MEN ogle YOUNGER WOMEN frolicking in
his pool

- He and Frank watch as TWO YOUNG GUESTS ransack his wine
cellar

- He OPENS gifts relishes in receiving a bottle of
SCOTCH with a ribbon around it

- He DOES COKE in the bathroom alone

- He watches two IDIOTS pour vodkawhite wine in his Koi
pond

- At one point he spots Sophie chatting with Marty
outside (the doorman) He watches as she hands him some
CASH

- He receives the gift of a SCARF from a FAMOUS FRIEND
He places it in a pile of identical boxes (everyone has
gotten him scarves)

- By the time evening descends on the party we pull away
from the festivities ending on Danny’s familiar shoes
But this time the shoes are empty

EXT MANSION - NIGHT 20

The party has pretty much cleared out day has turned
into night Danny (socks no shoes) and Frank (his
Manager we met him before) sit on Danny’s luxurious roof
deck Danny holds his recently gifted bottle of scotch
(still with ribbon now half empty)

Opposite them Sophie is passed out on a love seat As
usual she’s hanging out everywhere

FRANK
She’s like a young Jackie O

Danny CHUCKLES shakes his head

DANNY
I look absurd with her

FRANK
Yes you do

A beat She begins to snore drunkenly

DANNY
We have to make her sign a prenup

( )

Yes

Another beat

FRANK

DANNY
I’m way too old to be putting this
much shit up my nose

FRANK
Yes you are

DANNY
Jesus don’t give me all the good
stuff at once Frank You’re

FRANK

What do you want me to say No

standing next to a coked up
teenager who can’t keep her
nipples covered for more than five
minutes Prenup Who needs a
prenup I mean sure you’ve been
through three wives already but

real deal Oh look I can see her
vagina again

Danny smiles

DANNY
Cute

FRANK

Frank STANDS

FRANK (CONTD)
Okay so I got you a birthday
present and it cost me a fortune
so do me a favor and upside down
the frown for five minutes huh

Frank smiles bends and picks up a wrapped GIFT Danny
starts unwrapping Frank explains excitedly

FRANK (CONTD)
I know how fanatical you are about
Lennon so I started futzing
around on the internet Ebay
Lennon memorabilia that kind of
stuff

Wrapping paper is off Danny starts removing ribbons

( )

20 20

FRANK (CONTD)

I get in touch with this one guy
a collector say I’m looking to
get you something special

Frank takes a deep breath

FRANK (CONTD)
Holy shit I’ve been holding this
in for three months now
(then)
Danny wait hold on

Danny stops opening the gift

FRANK (CONTD)
You remember doing an interview
when you were a kid Something
called Chime Magazine Fella
named DeLoach

DANNY
(confused)
Yeah Maybe
FRANK

I don’t know what you’d said to
the guy - you mentioned Lennon
doesn’t matter Point is Lennon
read it And he wrote you a
letter

Danny lowers the box confused

DANNY
What Frank what the hell are
you talking about

FRANK
John Lennon wrote you a letter
Pal In 1971 He sent it to you
at the magazine care of this
DeLoach guy DeLoach smells money
- handwritten letter from John
Lennon and all - so he holds onto
it never tells you DeLoach
died he’s not the point The
point is he sold the letter to a
collector Can you believe this
shit

DANNY
I’m not following this Frank

FRANK
Open the box just open it
( ) 20

Danny does slowly Frank has had the letter framed and
matted beautifully

ON THE LETTER
It’s small handwritten Very personalized

FRANK (CONTD)

A handwritten letter to you from
John Lennon written in 1971 Can
you fucking believe it Read it

Danny is still processing He reads out loud slowly

DANNY
Dear Danny Collins Yoko and I
read your interview Being rich
and famous doesnt change the way
you think It doesnt corrupt
your art Only you can do that
So what do you think about that
Danny Collins Stay true to your
music Stay true to yourself
The rest will follow My phone
number is below Call me we can
discuss this We can help Love
John

FRANK
Crazy right I’ve been sitting
on this thing for months
As Frank continues rambling excitedly we PUSH in

ON DANNY

He’s just staring at the letter Reading it over and
over His world has clearly just rotated on its axis

A letter from your hero meant to be delivered to you
when you were twenty-one Warning you of all the things
you wound up doing and now regret Forty years too late
Can you imagine

CUE SONG Imagine (TBD) written by John Lennon
Everything SLOWS as Danny looks around the deck The
imagery conflicts with the beautiful song his fiancé
belching and half-conscious The hangers-on passed out
everywhere His preposterously lavish mansion

Sad horrific irony

The song carries into

A25

INT DANNY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 21
Danny lies there holding the letter still staring at it
It’s 545 AM and he hasn’t slept He’s slowly
unraveling He gets up whispers to Sophie
DANNY

I’1l be back late
She waves a hung-over arm at him
INT DANNY’S MERCEDES - EARLY MORNING 22
Danny drives through Los Angeles The Sunset Strip home
to the Roxy the Whisky Have you ever driven down
Sunset when there’s not a soul in sight It’s surreal
The whole time the letter sits next to Danny on the
passenger seat Haunting him
Danny pulls the car over EXITS
EXT SUNSET STRIP - CONTINUOUS 23
Danny walks to the curb Looks up Just stares We cut
WIDE revealing what he’s staring at
HIS GIANT BILLBOARD Danny stands in front of it
miniscule in comparison taking in the ridiculous picture
of himself winking atpointing at camera - the oversized
portrait a symbol of every bad decision he’s ever made
And that does it
Slowly ever so slowly a smile creeps over his face
He cracks his neck coming to terms with a decision and
He gets back in the car and races off Full speed now
EXT MANSION GATE - MOMENTS LATER 24
The Mercedes turns toward the gate But then the car
keeps going
EXT MANSION - MOMENTS LATER A25
Danny pops out from behind the “bridge” He’s entered

( ) 39

HOPE
Because when you were on the TV
Daddy said “Shut it off

really fast and then Mommy said
“Tom” and Daddy said “No” and
that was that

Samantha starts to say something but then starts talking
into the phone (he’s gotten on the line) As she talks

The question’s delivery catches Danny by surprise

DANNY

it

DANNY

Maybe I hope not
Samantha leans back thinks for a moment Then

SAMANTHA
My husband is the best man I’ve
ever met Solid Kind Funny

MARY (CONTD)
Mr Collins

DANNY
(head still down)
Yes

MARY
Wonder if you could help me with
something When a famous musician
starts getting fall-down drunk at
a hotel bar and you’re the
manager of that hotel is there a
protocol on how to handle the
situation We’ve had a shortage
of famous fall-down drunk
musicians here lately and I’ma
bit out of my depth

Danny finally opens his eyes looks up

DANNY
I had a bad day

MARY
Okay

He points at his glass

DANNY
That’s just water

MARY
Yes but that’s because the ice
melted

Danny nods He suddenly looks very vulnerable

DANNY
Please don’t be mean to me I
really did have a bad day
She nods SIGHS

this hotel

DANNY

Apparently not

Danny takes in Mary She’s back looking off into space
These are two very lost souls

DANNY (CONT’D)
Why’d you have a bad day

MARY
Oh because I work with a bunch of
well-meaning but remarkably dim
twenty-somethings who are just
passing time until they go back to
school And one of them screwed
up the computer system and it took
me half the day to reprogram every
reservation manually

Her drink is delivered she takes a sip
( ) 44

MARY (CONT’D)
You

Danny takes a sip bracing himself Then

DANNY
I tracked down my grown son who
Id never met before Met him
his wife my granddaughter Then
he told me quite emphatically to
fuck off and die

She processes this then
MARY
EVERY reservation each one had to
be reprogrammed manually I hope
I made that clear

Danny LAUGHS Mary leans forward serious

MARY (CONT’D)
Can I ask you a question

DANNY
Not if it’s about why I’ve never
met my son until today

MARY
Shit That was my question

They sit there for a long beat then turn back to the

DANNY

( )

MARY
I was just trying to be funny

DANNY

MARY
(completely gone)
We did split up at the worst time
possible but I don’t think she
hates me Oh maybe she does I
don’t want any more tequila

appealing

started back in the fancy studio of his mansion before
he’d received Lennon’s letter

But now it has words

Danny starts to sing the music is simple the melody
and lyrics wrenching

DANNY
It’s spring in my mindBut the
autumn leaves they fallAs I’m
walking byI collect them all

Danny stops looks up

MARY
Keep going keep going

DANNY
That’s as far as I got

Mary looks confused

DANNY (CONT’D)

lame attempt to get you to my
room

MARY
Jesus Christ

Mary shakes her head stands

DANNY
Come on Stay I’m an old man
with ten scotches in him The
odds of anything risqué happening
here are very very slim

MARY

Danny bends down confused

DANNY
You don’t want my music

Samantha explains pointedly

SAMANTHA
Tom explained to Hope the other
day how you’re a musician and how
some musicians go door to door to
sell their music

DANNY
Ohhh Okay

SAMANTHA

(still explaining)
But we weren’t interested in
buying any music Much the same
way some people aren’t interested
in buying Girl Scout cookies
Doesn’t mean we’re rude just that
we weren’t interested in buying
any music

DANNY
No I get it Possibly more
complicated an explanation than
required for a seven year old but
okay

Hope spots the bus

HOPE

TOM

Because you can’t afford it

Tom steps forward he’s had enough

TOM
You know what--

SAMANTHA

Tom

Tom goes quiet then

TOM

fucking business please

Behind them their nosy LANDSCAPING NEIGHBOR slips out of
frame

Samantha motions towards Danny to continue Danny takes
the opportunity

DANNY
People wait two years to get an
interview You have one in two
hours

Samantha looks at Tom Tom says nothing

DANNY (CONTD)
Just give me one day to do
something good for you Then I’m
gone forever You’1l still go to
heaven ‘cause you’re so damn
tolerant and I’1l still go to
hell because you can’t buy
redemption Everyone wins

Tom looks at Samantha She clearly wants this He
shakes his head There’s no stopping this train

The TOUR BUS sits outside

INT NEW COMPASS SCHOOL - LATER 54

The family stands in the middle of the school staring
It’s awe-inspiring

HOPE
This is a school

SAMANTHA
I’m not sure Baby

A MAN (40s) ENTERS in workout clothes This is the
HEADMASTER RYAN KURTZ He’s reading from a CLIPBOARD

KURTZ
Sorry to keep you waiting And
sorry I’m dressed like Jack
LaLanne I’m elastic-only on the
weekends I’m Dr Kurtz the
headmaster here--

TOM
Tom Donn--

KURTZ

Holy cow you really are Danny
Collins

Kurtz beelines for Danny Tom continues introducing
himself even though Kurtz is no longer listening

TOM
(to no one)
--Tom Donnelly my wife Samantha
our daughter Hope my balls are
in my wife’s purse if you’re
lucky you can meet them later

Samantha smiles smacks him Danny shakes Kurtz’s hand
KURTZ
Wow seeing you in person is way
different than talking to you on
the phone

DANNY
Good to meet you Doc

Kurtz turns to Tom

KURTZ
And you must be Hope

( )

54 54
TOM
(not that amused)
Tom

Kurtz feigns confusion turns toward Samantha

SAMANTHA

Kurtz smiles
KURTZ
Let me show you guys around
Were only half speed during our
summer camp programs but you can
still get a sense of the place

They follow him off Danny holds still unsure what to
do

KURTZ (CONTD)

Danny hesitates looks toward Tom Tom exasperated
throws up his hands in defeat

Hope runs ahead excited

Samantha keeps her eye on Hope as she talks to Kurtz (who
reads Hope’s paperwork as he walks)

SAMANTHA
When first grade started she
really started having trouble

TOM
We’ve had her working with a
private tutor once a week and I do
exercises with her every night
She has a really hard time
focusing retaining information--

DANNY
(interrupting)
It’s been a real struggle

Tom looks at Danny shocked by his chutzpah Kurtz
lowers the clipboard looks at Samantha and Tom

KURTZ
Most schools try to train children
like Hope to fit into their
systems We prefer to tailor a
program to fit the childs needs
(to Danny)
We call that our IEP

TOM
And that’s--

DANNY
Individualized Educational
Program right IEP

They all look over at Danny glasses on studiously
reading notes from his stationary pad

KURTZ
You’ve done your homework Mr
Collins

Kurtz leads Samantha into the next room We hang on
Danny who smiles proud of himself

You having fun

excited

final pair those belonging to Hope She is mesmerized
watching a ROOMFUL of ballet students dancing in unison

He parents are watching her

SAMANTHA
And so this whole place is just an
elementary school

KURTZ
(confused)
Elementary and middle We’d carry
Hope until 8th grade then wed
place her in--

TOM
I’m sorry I’m sorry We live
over an hour outside the city
How would she even--

DANNY
She’ll have a driver Every day
to and from school Everything
will be taken care of through
college It will be in writing

KURTZ

A more formal interview is
required obviously But
considering Mr Collins’ generous
donation and what I see in Hope’s
records I suspect the interview
will go well

(then)
I don’t usually come in ona
Saturday if you catch my drift

He smiles at Danny turns back to Tom and Samantha

KURTZ (CONTD)
You have a lot to discuss But
trust me you want this This can
change the course of Hope’s life

ON DANNY AND TOM

Alone Father and son facing off No one speaks It’s

a Mexican standoff Finally - surprisingly - it is Tom
that makes the first move

Silence

TOM
(serious)
You are a ridiculous man

This hangs there

TOM (CONTD)

I have spent my entire life trying
to become the kind of man you
aren’t I am exhausted You have
no idea how exhausting that has
been

Danny thinks explains

He pauses

Silence

DANNY
When I met your mother I was
strung out on God knows what
When I found out I tried to send
her money She refused it Over
the years I always wanted to find
you but

DANNY (CONTD)

My life was extreme The drugs
Women Travel I didn’t think
much of myself I thought you
were better off with a normal
life And then by the time I

realized I don’t know I don’t
know how I allowed it to go this
long

Tom finally leans forward

TOM
What you did today - your slate is
clean with me But that’s as far
as this goes

DANNY
I want to be a part of your life
TOM
No I can’t handle that right
now
DANNY

I can’t just walk away from this
TOM

Well you’re going to have to

because it’s just not a good time--

Not a good time what does that
mean not a good time--

TOM
I’m sick

It comes out quickly strongly and unintentionally

car goes silent

TOM (CONTD)
Shit

Danny is lost

DANNY
What the hell are you talking
about What do you mean you’re
sick

Tom shakes his head He doesn’t want to do this
Finally he gives in

TOM
It’s what Mom died
(beat then)
It’s in the blood It’s pretty
bad

Danny looks stunned A long silent beat as he
processes Then

DANNY
Are you fucking kidding me

Tom looks up surprised

DANNY (CONT’D)
I just met you I mean youve
got to be fucking kidding me

This hangs there awkwardly Danny takes a breath
regroups

DANNY (CONT’D)
Okay obviously that was not a
great reaction I’m sorry

who should be sorry After all

DANNY
Wait wait wait hold on she

Are you insane

TOM

Do you remember a few years ago we
were watching that thing on ESPN
about Mike Tyson And they were
saying how even though he’d made
like twenty million a fight he’d
blown it all and now he could
barely afford to feed the pigeons
on his roof

Danny processes this Then childlike asks

Well not quite but I’ve been
going over things with Bill and
youre not quite where you think

Tom and Samantha share a look still hesitant

But Danny

DANNY (CONT’D)

FROM BEHIND we watch Danny make his way toward the

ON HIS FEET

No more platform shoes Brown loafers have taken their
place

Simple and unadorned Center stage Danny sits

He leans into the microphone

DANNY

BACK TO DANNY

Suddenly frozen He just sits there playing the same
melody over and over again watching the CHANTING CROWD
His adoring granddaughter His son He knows what they
want from him
We watch it happen just like that - in an instant all
progress lost There’s too many people He’s too old
He can’t just change it up suddenly He knows what they
want and he has to give it to them He’s been doing it
for too many years to stop now
Slowly he stops playing His eyes are glossy

He turns to his band NODS They quickly pick up their
instruments

Danny stands as PHIL quickly scurries over behind the
piano

Danny grabs his microphone and forces a smile

DANNY (CONT’D)

He announces sadly

DANNY (CONTD)
I think you know this one--

The band launches into Danny’s MOST FAMOUS SONG The

He turns to go Danny calls out

DANNY
Yes keep judging me Tom you’re
great at that When you finish -
you know being so perfect and
honorable - maybe you should talk
to your wife about what you did in
“Delaware”

As soon as he says it he regrets it Tom freezes
Samantha (pushing Hope out the door) stops confused

SAMANTHA
Huh

Tom glares at Danny Samantha looks at Tom it’s too
weird not to comment on

SAMANTHA (CONTD)
What’s he talking about

Tom turns to her She looks at him expectant He knows
it’s over

TOM
Well talk at home okay

He leads his family out the door but not before turning
back towards Danny

He trails off The message is clear Nothing left to
say And with that

father The man saved my life
got me stone-cold sober and he

The point my boy is that he’s
always been better to others than
he has been to himself What you
do with that is up to you My
waters will keep coming no matter
what

silence And just then

The door OPENS Their heads jolt up and we
FADE TO BLACK
THE END
But not before we hear over black
DOCTOR SILVERMAN (0S)

Okay Tom so here’s where we
are

A NOTE TO THE READER

In 1971 John Lennon read an interview in a small music
Magazine The subject of the interview was a twenty-one
year old musician named Steve Tilston In the interview
Tilston admitted wondering if future wealth and fame
might one day hinder his ability to write powerful songs

And so John Lennon wrote Steve Tilston a letter

In the letter Lennon offered Tilston advice and
friendship as well as his home phone number

Steve Tilston did not receive the letter until 2005 He
was nearly sixty years old at the time
