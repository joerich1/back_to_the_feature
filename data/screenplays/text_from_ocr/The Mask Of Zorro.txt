FADE IN
On an apparently black screen We hear the voice of DIEGO

DIEGO (VO)

In 1822 General Santa Anna of
Mexico successfully overthrew the
Spanish rule Mexicos long war
for independence was won The
last Viceroy of Alta California
had been recalled to Spain
Realizing his days of power were
at an end the Viceroy ordered all
prisoners executed

(beat)
The spirit of justice demanded a
champion

A KNIFE BLADE pokes through the black screen from the other side
It cuts out one hole Then a second --
A PAIR of EYES peek through Childs eyes dark and watchful

JOAQUIN (0S)
Whats going on Alejandro Let me see

INT WAGON - DAY

The black screen is in fact the canvas side of a wagon
Crouched inside hiding are two boys They are

JOAQUIN MURIETTA ten years old on his way to manhood A great
older brother gentle with and protective of

ALEJANDRO MURIETTA eight Despite his age Alejandro is the
natural leader of the two although neither knows it

Alejandro moves over so he peeks out one eye hole Joaquin peers
through the other

WHAT THEY SEE

THE TOWN SQUARE Whitewashed walls and terra cotta the SUNSET
leaching color creating an almost black-and-white look Thronged
with people milling restlessly on the edge of where a crowd
becomes a mob

Order is kept by dozens of SOLDIERS standing sternly at arms
They keep a perimeter in the form a large semi-circle in front of
the VICEROYS BUILDING A six-man FIRING SQUAD sets up Three
bound PRISONERS await their fate

ON THE BOYS

ALEJANDRO
Hes not going to come

JOAQUIN
Should we move closer

Suddenly light spills across the two boys
UNDERTAKER (0S)
Hooligans What do you think
youre doing Get out of here
An UNDERTAKER glares in at them holding up a flap of canvas He
wears a black suit as severe as his expression Its his wagon

evidenced by the three empty coffins inside

ALEJANDRO
We should move closer

He slices the canvas and the two dive out into the square
EXT TOWN SQUARE - DAY

The boys scramble around and among the legs of onlookers moving
closer to the semi-circle

JOAQUIN
Where is he

ALEJANDRO
I dont see him

JOAQUIN
Hes got to come Hes very brave

On all fours they slip past a group of UNIFORMED SOLDIERS

ALEJANDRO
Yes but hes also very smart

The boys crawl past a MAN in ROUGH HOODED CLOAK his sandalled
feet visible --

He reaches out and grabs them (gently) by the ears It is FRAY
FELIPE an out-of-place scowl on his round jovial face

JOAQUIN
(horrified)
Fray Felipe

FELIPE
Do you suppose youre parents --
God-rest-their-souls -- would

approve of you two being here
(leans closer worried)
Theres going to be trouble Get
back to the mission -- now

He gives them a little push Abashed they move away aware of
Felipe watching them But as soon as he turns away --

Alejandro grabs Joaquin yanks him down Back on all fours
Joaquin leading they crawl back through the crowd Suddenly
Alejandro is cut off bumping into the knees of a MAN in a ROUGH
HOODED CLOAK Sure hes caught he looks down --

Beneath the monks robe are SHINY BLACK BOOTS WITH SILVER SPURS
And the SILVER TIP of a SCABBARD
Alejandros eyes go wide He looks up --

ANGLE - LOOKING UP Beneath the monks hood a mask a dashing
mustache the flash of a smile Its ZORRO He puts a finger to
his lips Shhh

Alejandro wheels scrambles back to Joaquin

ALEJANDRO
Joaquin Hes here Hes here

JOAQUIN
Zorros here

ALEJANDRO
(a finger to his lips
a la Zorro)
SHHHH Hes right over there --

He points --
The monks robe lies discarded on the ground

Alejandro looks around in wonder amazed at the disappearing
trick Joaquin grabs his hand heads for a ladder

JOAQUIN
cmon

Alejandro is dragged along he barely avoids running into --
DON LUIZ an older man tall and thin with an elegant goatee
He pushes through the crowd reaches the entrance to the
Viceroys Building Soldiers meet him with a challenge

DON LUIZ

Don Luiz The Viceroy sent for
me

INT VICEROYS BUILDING - DAY
Don Luiz moves down a hallway his face pale eyes taking in all
the activity He dodges servants as they rush past roll up
tapestries hurriedly pack household items etc Soldiers carry
heavy crates out moving with a sense of urgency

INT VICEROYS BUILDING - 2ND FLOOR STUDY - DAY

The door is ajar Don Luiz steps into the study which has been
cleared out quickly Shelves emptied drawers left open Papers
scattered about

A balcony opens off the room Looking out over the square is a
darkly handsome man with the eyes of a snake He wears an
understated military uniform and stands utterly still This is
RAFAEL MONTERO Viceroy of Alta California

DON LUIZ
I hoped it wasnt true Youre
returning to Spain

MONTERO

I am the Spanish Viceroy after
all -- and California is no longer
part of Spain

(bitter)
Santa Annas troops are already on
their way to take control of the
presidio

DON LUIZ
The Dons are worried How will
we fare under Mexico Ruled by
peasants

MONTERO

Who will squander this land the
same way Spain has California is
richer than anyone can imagine

(smiles )
Anyone but me One day Don Luiz
I will return And all of our
plans will see fruition

DON LUIZ
Know that we will always remain
loyal to you And will strive to

keep California at least a
little civilized
MONTERO

A hard thing in this land of
savages
He catches the eye of the firing SQUAD LEADER

MONTERO (CONTD)
Begin the execution

IN THE SQUARE Alejandro and Joaquin scramble across a roof
Below them the Squad Leader draws his sword

SQUAD LEADER
Preparén
(he raises his sword)

Apuntén

The crowd is still Alejandro and Joaquin search for Zorro
prisoners stand straight meeting death with honor

The Squad Leader is about to slash his arm down --

SQUAD LEADER
Disparen

Fingers tighten on triggers --

With a CRACK the fall of a whip wraps around one of the rifle

barrels -- and yanks it sideways into the next sending it

The

sideways and so on like dominoes so that all the rifles are

pointed at the SQUAD LEADER --

SQUAD LEADER
No dispdéren No disparen --

Too late -- the soldiers FIRE The Squad Leader crumples --

The whip-wielder leaps nimbly into the square an apparition in

black sword drawn Alejandro spots him first --

ALEJANDRO
Zorro

The crowd sees him People point a cry rises up

CROWD
EL ZORRO VIVA EL ZORRO

Zorro reaches the prisoners Three quick slashes free them

Several of the soldiers reload Others draw their swords attack

Zorro --

Zorro fights with graceful economy anticipating all attacks

As the freed prisoners make their escape Felipe upends a wagon

of barrels The barrels roll free blocking and tripping
soldiers The CROWD has erupted some of the peasants try to
block the soldiers who club them down --

Zorro parries two soldiers swords into a wheel of the overturned
wagon spins the wheel their swords are wrenched away

ON MONTERO AND DON LUIZ
DON LUIZ
Trust Zorro to spoil a good

execution

MONTERO
I was counting on it

He takes a candle from a sconce light a torch strapped to the
balcony rail The torch FLARES to life --

ON ALEJANDRO AND JOAQUIN as they look up see the signal --

-- as do several SOLDIERS who emerge onto the wood balcony
below the boys taking up positions to fire at Zorro

ALEJANDRO
Look

JOAQUIN
An ambush Weve got to warn
Zorro --

Alejandro is ahead of him Theres a large loose brick on the
roofs edge He strains to shove it off Joaquin joins him --

The stone SMASHES down on the soldiers taking them out
Zorro turns at the noise sees the soldiers -- then spots the
boys Other soldiers start firing at him Zorro dives away

SMASHES through the door of a building --

Alejandro and Joaquin peer over the roofs edge Like the
soldiers they wait for Zorro to reappear --

Black-gloved hands drop onto their shoulders They spin --
It is Zorro He has almost magically appeared behind them

ZORRO
My thanks to you gentlemen

He removes a MEDALLION from around his neck It has an intricate
design several circles within the large circle with various
lines of radii intersecting
ZORRO

Here A symbol of my gratitude
But youll have to share it

He holds it Its a ceremonious moment

The Medallion gleams

Alejandro reaches for it but too late -- Joaquin takes it
ZORRO
Now -- if youll excuse me

And he steps off the roof onto an
then onto --

MONTEROS BALCONY Zorro holds his
flinch Behind him Don Luiz fades

throat

ZORRO

overhang

blade on Montero who does
back fingering his own

You were willing to kill those men

to trap me

MONTERO

Id have killed a hundred men --

if I could be sure that
them was you

ZORRO
You should have learned
No innocent will die as

one of

by now
long as

Im alive to rescue them Three

men Three cuts

Lightning-quick he makes THREE QUICK CUTS on
Montero slaps a hand up covering them

ZORRO
A souvenir of your days
California
(beat)

in

Good-bye Montero And good

riddance

He whistles --

A HUGE BLACK STALLION gallops into the square

Monteros neck

Zorro leaps

from the balcony onto its back Soldiers scramble as Zorro
gallops through them up a flight of exterior stairs --

Silhouetted against the setting sun low on the horizon Zorro
horseback leaps from rooftop to rooftop then

is gone

ON ALEJANDRO AND JOAQUIN watch in awe as he disappears With

leaps to a canopy

not

on

the
feeling of ceremony Joaquin lifts the medallion drapes it
around his neck Alejandro reaches out to touch it lightly
reverently

ON THE BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE SQUARE Montero lowers his hand
from his neck On the palm is the bloody IMPRINT of a backwards
Z mirroring the one on his neck

Montero clenches his hand into a bloody fist
EXT SECRET CAVE - NIGHT

A waterfall cascades over stone Zorro rides up dismounts
smoothly Removes the horses tack and saddle pets him

ZORRO
There you go Tornado Take the
rest of the night off

Tornado snorts gallops away Saddle over his shoulder Zorro
climbs a path disappears behind the waterfall --

INT DE LA VEGA HACIENDA - HALLWAY - NIGHT

A large GRANDFATHER CLOCK swings aside on oiled hinges It is a
secret doorway cave wall visible beyond DIEGO DE LA VEGA steps
out Mid-thirties a dashing and handsome man

INT DE LA VEGA HACIENDA - ELENAS ROOM - NIGHT

Diego steps in quietly A striking view through the window
distant cliffs above the moonlit ocean A large stand of
manzanita just outside But Diegos eyes are on the small
occupant of a crib beneath the window sill--

DIEGO
Hello darling Elena Do you want
to hear what your father did
tonight It is quite the hair-
raising adventure --

In the crib is ELENA DE LA VEGA almost two A sleeping angel --
with funny-looking spiky hair Diego dotes on her

DIEGO
(re her hair)
Oh youve heard it already

ESPERANZA (0S)
She doesnt understand a word you
say She just likes the sound
of your voice
Standing in the doorway is ESPERANZA She wears a simple dress

accented by a yellow pafuelo -- a full-length silk scarf If
Elena grows up to resemble her mother at all (and she will)
will break a thousand hearts Diego slips an arm around
Esperanzas waist

DIEGO
Someday shell listen to my
stories thats all I ask

INT DE LA VEGA HACIENDA - SALA - NIGHT

Exposed oak beams Elegant furniture and filled bookshelves
by candlelight Diego and Elena enter

ESPERANZA
All I ask is you be around to tell
them

More fear is in her tone than she intended Diego notes it

DIEGO
Esperanza

She gestures one moment Shuts her eyes gathering herself
She looks at Diego in control of her fear now

ESPERANZA
Diego I love you and I love
you for what you do But
I can smell the gunsmoke on you
(wryly)
And youre not getting any younger --

DIEGO
(pulls her close)
I assure you My bones arent brittle yet
ESPERANZA
Not all of them anyway
A passionate kiss -- Suddenly the door CRASHES open a

she

Lit

soldiers full weight behind it Other SOLDIERS spill in behind

him

ESPERANZA
Madre de Dios --

Montero strides in A blood-stained bandage is around his throat

DIEGO
Viceroy -- this is my home What
do you want here
(re the bandage)
Did you cut yourself shaving

MONTERO
Glib as ever de la Vega I have
come to settle things between us

DIEGO
There is nothing between us

MONTERO
You are a betrayer de la Vega
You have stood against me -- and
your fellow Dons -- for as long as

I can remember

DIEGO
Only when you were wrong Which
has been as long as I can
remember

MONTERO
Youve secretly funded General
Santa Anna and his craven rebels
-- Dont deny it

Montero regards Diego coldly

MONTERO (CONTD)
You have many powerful friends in
Spain as well as Mexico But none
will seek revenge for the death of

Zorro
Esperanza and Diego stare at him And then -- they laugh

ESPERANZA
Believe me Rafaél -- if he were

Zorro Id be the first to know

DIEGO
No actually I would --

Montero stares at Esperanza He shakes his head
MONTERO
You chose badly Esperanza You

gave your love to the wrong man

Her eyes blaze She returns his gaze levelly
ESPERANZA

There was never any choice to

make

Diego steps between them

Glares at Montero

DIEGO
I think youre dizzy Montero
From loss of blood perhaps

MONTERO

For fifteen years Zorro has been a

thorn in my side
suspected you
never had any proof

From beneath his jacket he produces a black cape and mask --
Holds them up to a SERGEANT

imitations of Zorros

MONTERO
Find these somewhere
(nods his head)
And kill him

A soldier grabs for Diego
from the soldiers belt

Diego

DIEGO
Now you choose
house Or
(a deadly smile)
Actually

MONTERO

Montero

Ive always
de la Vega

I just

poor

evades him slides the sword

SLAMS the soldier hard into a wall

Leave my

theres no choice there

Everyone knows that Diego de la

Vega has no affection for the
fight
He attacks engaging Diego -- who is of course Zorro Montero
smiles at Diegos skill

MONTERO
You really are Zorro

DIEGO
Affection and ability
different things

This time Diego attacks forcing

A soldier sword drawn moves to

arent you

Montero back

attack Diegos back --
Esperanza grabs a broom and trips him The Sergeant is drawing
his pistol Esperanza shoves the bristles into his face knocking
him back then smacks the pistol away

A second soldier moves toward Diego and Montero who continue
their duel blades FLASHING in candlelight

A third soldier moves toward Diego --

The Sergeant finds his lost pistol takes aim at Diego --
Esperanza leaps to defend Diego from the third soldier --
The Sergeant FIRES --

The SHOT freezes the room The next sound is --
ESPERANZAS GASP --

Diego and Montero watch in horror as she crumples to the floor

The Sergeant aghast still holds the smoking pistol

As one Diego and Montero lunge their blades piercing the
Sergeants heart The Sergeant falls back against a standing
candelabra It topples setting curtains ABLAZE

Diego drops his sword leaps to Esperanza He cradles her in his
arms her blood staining his shirt

DIEGO
Oh Esperanza Esperanza

Montero moves closer stands over him staring down in horror at
Esperanza He is genuinely stricken oblivious to the flames
growing around them

MONTERO
(soft to himself)
You deserved better You would

have loved to see Spain

A BURNING BEAM CRASHES down separating the two men Diego throws
himself back as FLAMES ERUPT HIGHER --

DIEGO

Elena

He scrambles toward her room WOOD CREAKS --
-- Diego turns as a section of WALL FALLS INWARD He throws up
his arms in defense --

THE SCREEN GOES BLACK

EXT DE LA VEGA HACIENDA - NIGHT
Diego lands hard he comes to slowly Firelight illumines his
face He raises his hands -- they are chained He is in a cage on
a wagon with several other prisoners His eyes focus and he
gasps --

-- through the bars he sees his hacienda ENGULFED IN FLAMES

DIEGO
Elena ELENA

SOLDIER
Shes still inside

Diego snaps a look at him his rage building He rattles the cage
bars lets loose an almost animal howl --

DIEGO
Montero DAMN YOU TO HELL
MONTERO I will find you and kill
you --

The Soldier RINGS his sword off the bars

SOLDIER
Shut up The Viceroy didnt get
out either
(to the driver)
Take him away Youll rot in the
dungeons at Talamantes de la
Vega Youll die there

The wagon starts forward with a jerk Diego stares at the BURNING
HACIENDA He collapses back draws his knees up to his chest
defeated

Rain begins to fall

DIEGO
I am dead all ready
(a whisper)
Esperanza Elena

The Soldier watches the wagon disappear

From the Hacienda comes the sound of the ROOF COLLAPSING And
then SHOUTS --

A FIGURE appears runs OUT OF THE FLAMES Cloaked in a smoldering

carpet Soldiers gather round him --

eS Te

The figure throws back the carpet from his face leaves it
wrapped around him like a cape It is MONTERO

SOLDIER
Viceroy Youre all right --

MONTERO
Wheres de la Vega

SOLDIER

others

Montero is livid This is not what he intended

MONTERO
No Get him back here Ill kill

A SCOUT steps forward

SCOUT
No time sir There are Mexican
troops just over the hills
Theyll see the fire --

MONTERO
Damn

Montero stares in the direction Diegos wagon went Considers his
course of action
MONTERO
Damn him Lets go

There comes the soft sound of a BABY CRYING Montero throws the
carpet all the way off --

In his arms is ELENA He cradles her protecting her from the
rain
MONTERO
Shh nifia Shh Ill take care

(pulls her close)
You should have been mine and now

The rain POURS down extinguishing the FLAMES of the burning
hacienda Smoke pours across the huge full moon

SLOW DISSOLVE TO

EXT ROAD - DAY - TWENTY YEARS LATER

CLOSE ON THE MEDALLION Hanging from the neck of JOAQUIN
MURIETTA twenty years older Intense earnest -- and in trouble
Also around his neck is a ROPE tying him to --

-- ALEJANDRO MURIETTA trailing behind Handsome despite his
unkempt hair and shaggy beard Their hands apparently tied behind
them they are prisoners of --

THREE-FINGERED JACK a powerfully-built man the rough look of a
bounty hunter Only three fingers on his left hand the bones of
the other two jut from his hat band On horseback he leads the

brothers by the rope

They crest a hill In the distance is a WATERING STATION -- a
small produce shack with a horse trough and feed bins

Jack grins gives the rope a yank Alejandro and Joaquin exchange
a defeated glance trudge forward --

EXT WATERING STATION -- DAY

CLOSE ON A POSTER WANTED THE MURIETTA BROTHERS Passable
drawings of Joaquin and Alejandro

The poster is being nailed to a post by CORPORAL LOPEZ a bandy
cock soldier He is watched by the OWNER his little GIRL an OLD
MAN and a FARMER

Three SOLDIERS loiter guarding a horse-drawn wagon Their horses
drink and the soldiers help themselves to produce -- to the
Owners disgust

FARMER
The army should be capturing these
bandits -- instead of just nailing

up wanted posters People have
been disappearing --
(worried)
I havent seen Jose Gonzales in weeks

OWNER
Hes right There are more and more disaparecidos all the time
Farmers Indians -- even woman and children No ones safe
LOPEZ
(shrugs)

A few peasants disappear what
does it matter These Muriettas
actually dare to rob cabelleros
and soldiers

FARMER
The only ones with any money

OLD MAN
Zorro could capture them Zorro
could find the disappeared ones

GIRL
Whos Zorro

Lopez rolls his eyes
LOPEZ

You peasants Have to have your
little stories about Zorro

He picks up a tomato lazily bites into it

OLD MAN
(to the girl)
Zorro was a great man -- a
champion He protected us He
would stop the disappearances if
he were here

OWNER
He would make people pay for the
food they ate

Lopez backhands him -- suddenly and violently

LOPEZ
These are taxes To pay the
soldiers who do protect you

He kneels beside the Girl addresses her like a kindly uncle

LOPEZ (CONTD)

Ill tell you who Zorro was
Zorro was a crazy man who wore a
mask Do you know what that makes
him A bandit And if he showed
himself around here wed treat
him just like any other bandit

(a tomato-red smile)
Wed hunt him down and kill him

FARMER
Or get someone to do it for you

He points Everyone looks where hes pointing At JACK leading
ALEJANDRO and JOAQUIN coming up the road

The soldiers raise their rifles warily Lopez gestures for them
to wait as Jack draws near

JACK
I heard soldiers came through here
every week I think I got some
people you want to meet

FARMER
(looking at the poster)
Its them Its the Murietta
brothers

Lopez examines the brothers Squints at the poster Jack
dismounts crowds forward everyone trying to see the poster

ALEJANDRO
So -- how much is the reward
(Lopez glares at him)
Just asking

JOAQUIN
(boastful)
Well these soldiers are
delivering the army payroll That
sounds about right

LOPEZ
Ha The rewards two hundred
pesos

ALEJANDRO
(aghast)
Two hundred pesos For each of
us

Joaquin reaches up tears down the poster looks at it

JOAQUIN
For both of us

ALEJANDRO
Thats insulting
(to Jack)
If I were you I wouldnt accept
it You worked too hard to catch
us

Lopezs eyes widen -- he finally notices that Joaquins hands are
free holding the poster He points --

LOPEZ
Hey -- youre not tied up
A ‘click -- Lopez is looking down the barrel of Jacks pistol

he freezes But the soldiers are startled into action Two rush
at Jack --

Alejandro steps to one side drops to his knees --
ALEJANDRO
Joaquin Down

Joaquin drops to his knees The rope between them is taut
Alejandro keeps a grip on the rope leaving some slack around his
neck -- but Joaquin doesnt He is choked yanked over as the
soldiers trip over the rope

Alejandro slips the rope off his neck jumps the two downed
soldiers subdues them --

The third soldier takes aim at Alejandro Joaquin draws a sword
-- an old tarnished spadroon -- from where it was hidden in
Jacks bedroll He dives knocks the rifle aside as the soldier
FIRES the shot going wide

The soldier attacks Joaquin with his bayonet -- and disarms him
easily His sword goes flying

JOAQUIN
Hey

Joaquin grabs the rifle barrel and yanks it away -- then swings
it like a bat clocking the soldier

Its over in seconds and Lopez is still staring down Jacks gun
barrel The onlookers are a little stunned by it all

JOAQUIN
(rubbing his throat)
Damn it Alejandro -- next time

warn me

Alejandro doesnt look up Hes too busy going through the
unconscious soldiers pockets

ALEJANDRO
Next time

Jack gun still on Lopez picks up the Wanted Poster

JACK
Look at this Im not on here
(to Lopez)

Im Three-Fingered Jack How hard
is it to remember that

(holds up his hand)
Three fingers See
Three-Fingered Jack

Now Alejandros loading food into a basket as he makes the
peasants turn their pockets inside-out Hes not impressed

ALEJANDRO
Maybe you shouldnt make an issue
of it Jack

JACK
Im a member of this gang I want
a little respect

The Old Man brings Joaquin his sword Joaquin takes it makes a
few swipes

OLD MAN
Are you supposed to be Zorro

JOAQUIN
(flattered)
You think I look like Zorro

OLD MAN
No

Joaquin deflates Alejandro chuckles tosses the basket of food
into the wagon climbs on

OLD MAN (CONTD)
Zorro wasnt a bandit He just used to wear a medallion like
yours thats all

JOAQUIN
Go away

He climbs up on the wagon beside Alejandro

JOAQUIN (CONTD)
Lets get out of here

He tries to ignore Alejandros grin Alejandro flicks the reins
The wagon moves

LOPEZ
Captain Love will have your heads
for this

Jack still has his gun on Lopez He raises his hand -- Lopez
cowers back -- but Jack just displays his fingers

JACK
Remember Three-Fingered Jack

LOPEZ
Ill remember

He mounts his horse smiles ‘thank you Waves daintily spurs
the horse Follows the wagon away leaving behind unconscious
soldiers excited onlookers and an angry Lopez

EXT HILLSIDERAVINE - DAY

The wagon driverless horseless careens down the hillside
SMASHES into the ravine

Jack wielding a pry bar SNAPS OPEN a strongbox lock
Joaquin strips off the lock throws back the lid --

The box is filled with GOLD INGOTS The outlaws gasp
Alejandro lifts one out Turns it in his hands

JACK
Were rich
(to Joaquin)
We can keep it right

JOAQUIN
Half Half we give to the mission

ALEJANDRO
Dont start that Whatve they
ever done for us

JOAQUIN
Fray Felipe raised us -- taught us

ALEJANDRO
And we turned out so well That
gold is ours We should just take
it and run

JOAQUIN
Dammit Alejandro --

ALEJANDRO
This isnt some army payroll
This is something else --
something big Theyll hunt us

disaparecidos

JOAQUIN

Elena and Old Salt exchange shocked glances

I cant imagine what shed be

MONTERO (0S)
Neither can I -- but I cant find
her anywhere else

Elena makes a decision Tosses the Old Salt her sword grabs up
a traveling cloak -- and wriggles out through a porthole

The Old Salt strikes a nonchalant pose -- realizes
the swords He stashes them reassumes his pose --
as the CAPTAIN finds him

CAPTAIN
We are looking for Don Monteros

ELENA

MONTERO
No matter I must go ashore

ELENA
Why Father Whats wrong

MONTERO

Nothing dear Nothing that need

Montero looks away out across the water lost in thought
INT TALAMANTES PRISON - DAY

A TORCH blazes Montero carries it trailed by the Warden and
several guards

The cell block is all wet stone and rusted iron bars Narrow
shafts of sunlight are swallowed by the oppressive darkness

MONTERO
His name is Diego de la Vega He
must be here

WARDEN
Im sorry sir but we dont keep
records Prisoners have no need
for names And only the dead
leave Talamantes

Montero shoves the torch between the bars of a cell Only then do

we see the prisoner inside blinking painfully at the light
Its not Diego

Montero moves to the next cell not Diego The next Not Diego
The next The next

A prisoner lies on the ground unmoving Eyes staring Flies
buzzing -- hes dead And hes not Diego Montero moves on

WARDEN
Get a coffin Bury him

One of the Guards -- ORDAZ -- unlocks the cell door The other
two stay with Montero and the Warden

Montero moves faster checking one cell after another one face
after another recognizing none of them

In one cell a prisoner sits huddled in the shadows Montero
shoves the torch in --

CLOSE ON THE PRISONERS EYES Reflecting the torch light
It is DIEGO Twenty years older Diego has been ravaged by time
Bearded gray hair face heavily lined -- none from laughter One

leg is manacled the chain bolted into the wall

Montero peers at him No recognition He moves on throwing the
cell back into darkness
But Diego has recognized Montero He steps out of the shadows
staring after him

Diego watches Montero continue down the block the Warden and the
other two guards trailing

MONTERO
You must be right Warden He
must be dead

Diego grabs the bars rattles them in anger
DIEGO
(a whisper)
Hes alive

A SCRAPE from down the hall Diego sees

ORDAZ dragging a rough wooden coffin to the dead mans
cell Diegos eyes narrow --

DIEGO
Guard

His voice is just a raw croak Ordaz looks up

ORDAZ
I thought you were dumb

Diego motions him closer Ordaz moves warily

ORDAZ (CONTD)
I been here ten years Whats so
important you have to talk now

DIEGO
(still hoarse)
The man that man is looking for
- I know who he is

ORDAZ
Who

DIEGO
(shakes his head)
Youll get a reward I want some
too Better food More of it

Ordaz thinks it over

ORDAZ
If its worth something to Don
Montero itll be worth something
to you

Diego nods reluctantly Ordaz checks for listeners moves close
to the bars Lowers his voice

ORDAZ (CONTD)
Who is it

DIEGO
Me

He whips the rope belt from his pants loops it around the
guards neck yanks his head into the bars with a CLANG Ordaz
fights -- Diego CLANGS him again And again

Ordaz slumps unconscious Diego grabs Ordazs key ring unlocks
his cell door drags the Guard inside

He smiles as he tries one of the keys on his manacle It doesnt
work He tries anther No good Then another and another each

more frantically --

None of the keys fit Crushed Diego drops the key ring

He searches Ordaz Finds a dagger his boot tries to fiddle the
lock with it digs at the ring in the wall -- useless

Diego feels defeated Then his gaze falls on --
-- Ordazs POWDER HORN

Diego pours black powder into the manacles keyhole Packs it
with the dagger Uses a strip of Ordazs tunic as wadding

He wraps more of the tunic around his manacled foot to protect
it A pouch on Ordazs belt holds shot and flints Diego strikes
one of the flints against the dagger

The wadding smolders Diego blows it to life The makeshift fuse
burns quickly Diego hauls Ordazs body between him and the
manacle as a shield --

THE POWDER EXPLODES with a flash blowing open the manacle --

Diego strips the now-BURNING wrap off his foot teeth gritted
screaming a silent scream His foot is blackened and bloody But
the toes are all still there He wriggles them thankfully

A large chunk of metal juts from Ordazs chest Diego shoves him
aside without remorse He stands Winces at the pain from his
foot Looks down at Ordazs At his BOOTS
INT TALAMANTES PRISON - NEW ANGLE - DAY

The two other Guards with a BURIAL DETAIL of four prisoners go
into the dead mans cell The coffin lies there shut tight No
body

SECOND GUARD
Wheres Ordaz

THIRD GUARD
Who cares You four -- haul that
out of here

The prisoners move to lift the coffin --
It is heavy They struggle The Prison Guard snaps a flail

THIRD GUARD
Put your backs into it

They haul the coffin up and carry it through the door into the
corridor They carry it past --

DIEGOS CELL Where a prisoner huddles in the shadows ORDAZ the
dead guard His feet are bare

EXT TALAMANTES PRISON - DAY

The prisoners sweaty with exertion lower the coffin into a
freshly-dug shallow grave They spade dirt in on top of it --

EXT TALAMANTES PRISON - NIGHT
The graveyard The white crosses glow in the light of the moon

The fresh grave There is the sound of wood SPLINTERING The dirt
SHIFTS Moves CAVES IN --

Diegos hand clutching the dagger shoves out the dirt

Diego hauls himself out of the coffin out of the earth He gasps
for air draws deep cleansing breaths He looks back into the
coffin at the body Crosses himself

He rises His leg buckles Diego grabs one of the wooden crosses
Uses it as a crutch he limps from the graveyard

DISSOLVE TO
EXT COASTLINE - BEACH - NIGHT
A rocky cove spectacular in the moonlight A campfire burns just

short of the treeline Joaquin and Alejandro lay on bedrolls
Three-Fingered Jack stands watch
JOAQUIN
- Ive always wanted a horse A
black one And a silver trimmed
saddle and silver stirrups
People will see me and say
‘There that must be a great man

Three-Fingered Jack leaves his post comes toward the fire

JACK
I know what Im going to do with
my share Im going to Frisco
Ill sip amontillado buy the most
beautiful women and smoke
cigarettes How ‘bout you Alejandro

ALEJANDRO
I couldnt hope to match the
grandeur of your dreams

JOAQUIN
Oh come on Tell us again about
the magnificent hacienda the love
of a sweet dark-eyed seforita who
calls you Don Alejandro

ALEJANDRO
You keep your horse Joaquin
Ill keep my sefiorita --

There is a CRACK from the darkness The three freeze and then
Alejandro dives for his gun --

-- but stops short a BAYONET in his face freezing him A
soldier stands over him

The camp is quickly circled by soldiers some with lanterns some
on horses all with guns leveled

A man on a superb buckskin horse looms out of the darkness
CAPTAIN HARRISON LOVE His posture is perfect his gaze intense
A dueling scar on his left cheek He wears a small sword a saber
hangs in a scabbard from his saddle First last and always he
is a soldier He has a Texas accent

Love gazes down imperiously a wanted poster in his hand

LOVE
So The infamous Murietta
Bandits
(nods to Jack)
And you must be Three-Fingered
Jack

He displays the poster Its a new one with three drawings
Joaquin Alejandro and a three-fingered hand Jack slips his
hand behind his back

JACK
Maybe maybe not

LOVE
am Captain Harrison Love of the
First Dragoons of California And
you are my prisoners

(mocking)
Truth to tell I expected more of
a fight
ALEJANDRO

f you insist

Alejandro kicks away the rifle pointed at him Grabs two burning
logs and virtually throws the campfire at the soldiers SHOTS are
FIRED --

Soldiers scatter as Loves horse rears back Jack grabs his
pistol SHOOTS a soldier Joaquin dives for his sword He runs a
soldier through --

A soldier reloads his breech-loader from a cartridge pouch
Alejandro shoves a burning log at the pouch IGNITING it He
pushes the soldier into two others --

The cartridges EXPLODE taking all three out --

ALEJANDRO
Scatter

He grabs one of the soldiers swords The outlaws run SHOTS
follow them --

LOVE
You two -- secure the strongbox
The rest -- after them

He spurs his horse after Joaquin the soldiers following --

EXT WOODS - VARIOUS - NIGHT

ON ALEJANDRO who heads uphill He breaks into a clearing where
an ARMED SOLDIER turns and sees him

Alejandro brandishes his sword with a flourish
The Armed Soldier grins pulls his pistol
Alejandro looks distressed at the sight of the gun He flinches
raising his sword as the SHOT is FIRED --

The SOUND of bullet hitting steel Alejandro looks his sword is
broken But he is okay He grins --

Now the Armed Soldier looks distressed He tries to re-load his
pistol -- Alejandro hurls the sword hilt at him hitting him in
the head He grabs the soldiers LANTERN takes off

A RIDER and a SOLDIER on foot turn and look Alejandros LANTERN
bobs in and among the trees They follow

ON JOAQUIN running down a rock-covered slope into a spill of
moonlight He pulls up short a deadfall blocks his way He
unsheathes his sword turns A SHOT ricochets nearby he dives
for cover Another SHOT kicks rock chips into his face

ON JACK who is chased along the shore One soldier braces his
rifle on a piece of driftwood FIRES --
Jack crumples shot in the leg Soldiers converge

ON ALEJANDRO who comes to the edge of a steep hill He sees
Joaquin below on the rocky slope Sounds of pursuit near

The Rider gestures they split up The Soldier creeps toward the
bobbing LANTERN He steps around a tree pistol leveled

The LANTERN hangs from a bobbing tree branch

SOLDIER
Its a damned trick --

He turns -- too late Alejandro hits him hard knocks him out
Grabs the pistol and rifle extinguishes the lantern

ON JOAQUIN pinned by rifle fire One soldier moves closer -- and
has a clear shot at Joaquin He draws a bead --
-- and a SHOT kills him --

ON ALEJANDRO who looks up from the sights of his stolen rifle
smiles

ON JOAQUIN as another soldier charges forward bayonet at ready
Joaquin parries the thrust -- but the bayonet impales him in the
thigh He cries out clubs the man down

Love reins up

Joaquin stands there sword drawn waiting
Love smiles Draws the heavy saber from its scabbard

Joaquin doesnt like the looks of this He dodges left but
his leg betrays him --

Loves horse sidesteps in half-pass cutting him off
Joaquin tries again --

Love backs the horse up its body blocking Joaquin off Hes
playing with him a cat with a mouse

Love swings his saber at Joaquin who barely parries in time the
heavy blade knocking him off-balance He falls backward

Love advances The horse rears draws its front legs in -- a
levade It kicks out with its front legs smashes Joaquins sword
from his grasp It lands in the deadfall out of sight

LOVE
You are not worthy of that blade
Murietta

Loves face gives no hope of mercy Joaquin gambles he feints
then dives rolls beneath the horse comes up on the other side

Loves buckskin pirouettes the spin giving impetus to Loves
blade slicing through the air toward Joaquins neck --

-- and suddenly THE MEDALLION IS SAILING FREE
It lands in a crevice stained by Joaquins blood

ON ALEJANDRO his eyes wide in shock

ALEJANDRO
Joaquin JOAQUIN

Furious he breaks from his hiding place toward Love --

ALEJANDRO
Damn you you bastard DAMN YOU

He FIRES the pistol --

Love doesnt flinch The bullet barely misses him hits a tree
behind him He draws a handkerchief from his sleeve wipes his
blade his eyes never leaving Alejandro

ALEJANDRO
Ill kill you

Several mounted soldiers join Love Jack still alive is slung
over the saddle of one Alejandro pulls up short
The soldiers take aim --

Alejandro leaps for the Rider who was hunting him knocks him off
his horse Swings across the saddle in a trick-riding mount He
reins the horse around stares down at Love

ALEJANDRO
I will see you dead Love

RIFLE FIRE tears up the tree beside Alejandro He wheels the
horse disappears into the woods

ON LOVE as he gestures for his soldiers to pursue
LOVE

Go capture him
(to one soldier)

You -- bring this ones body
(sharp)

And take special care with the

head

EXT BAY - BEACH - MORNING

Monteros ship lies at anchor Longboats row toward shore The
beach is undeveloped -- no buildings or docks -- but full of
activity VAQUEROS stack cured cattle hides Trappers traders
set out their wares

A small knot of CABALLEROS wait away from the others They are
powerful dons dressed in their silver-trimmed finery

The first longboat hits the beach Montero steps out of it DON
LUIZ elderly now one eye milky with cataracts steps forward He
carries a dark wood alcaldes cane

DON LUIZ
(loudly)
The Viceroy is returned

Some cheers from the gathering people on the beach and a number
of frowns But the cabelleros applaud step forward Among them
DON HECTOR who resembles a bulldog DON AGUILAR a bow-legged

dandy

HECTOR
Welcome back to California Don
Montero

MONTERO
Don Hector Its been a long
time Don Aguilar Don Ramon

(smiles warmly)
Luiz

DON LUIZ
Rafaél

They embrace

MONTERO
You look comfortable holding the
alcaldes cane Don Luiz

Don Luiz regards the silver-handled cane in his hand It
distinctive -- polished but still retaining the natural
and curves of the wood

DON LUIZ
The alcaldes job is difficult --
but it does seem to suit me

BYSTANDER
(a little too loudly)

Ha -- the alcaldes as crooked as
his cane

Don Luiz spots him raises his cane angrily --

DON LUIZ
How dare you --

MONTERO
Wait Don Luiz
(to the Bystander)
Youre unhappy with the way youre
being governed

is
twists

The Bystander screws up his courage -- and tells the truth

BYSTANDER
«- Yes

Montero turns addresses a TRADER drawing in listeners

MONTERO
And you -- you feel ill-served by
your government Neglected

TRADER
Except at tax time

MONTERO
(laughs)
Of course Tell me Don Luiz --
are you carrying out the edicts of
Mexico

LUIZ
As best I can --

Montero plays to the crowd an impromptu stump speech
MONTERO
Thats the problem You are being
ruled by a government in absentia
You have no representation No
voice in your own futures

There are nods murmurs of agreement One man is not smiling as
he pushes through the crowd --

DIEGO

He stares fiercely at Montero murder in his eyes He moves
toward the front He still uses his make-shift cane

MONTERO (CONTD)
Thats what led to the formation
of the Republic of Texas The
Republic of New Mexico Perhaps
it is time for Californios to take
the reins of the destiny of
California

The crowd begins to buzz about the idea With a smile Montero
moves on surrounded by the dons

HECTOR
Its a heady idea isnt it An
independent California

DON LUIZ
Was General Santa Anna willing to
listen to our proposal

MONTERO
Santa Anna will listen to
anything as long as it ends with
the sound of change in his
pockets
(its great news)
He has agreed to our proposal

The Dons are happily surprised

MONTERO (CONTD)
Hell be arriving at the end of
the month

DON LUIZ
My God thats wonderful
Wonderful news
HECTOR
You are a miracle worker Don
Montero

Montero glances down the beach --

Captain Love rides toward them at full gallop A BURLAP BAG hangs
from his saddle holding something basketball-sized

Love dismounts even as the horse is slowing Diego is cut off he
changes course through the crowd frustrated

Love strides to Montero grasps his hand

MONTERO
Harrison I was wondering where
you were

LOVE
Don Montero Good to see you
sir

DON LUIZ

On your recommendation Captain
Love has taken command of the
presidio He has done an
excellent job ridding the pueblo
of its less desirable elements

ON DIEGO moving closer A small motion and something drops from
his sleeve into his hand a DAGGER

MONTERO
When you wrote to me of the
lawlessness in California I knew
it called for a strong hand

Love rests his hand on the burlap bag hanging from his saddle

LOVE
And a sharp sword
(humbly)
In fact I believe it is safe to
say that there is nothing and no
one to fear in all of California

ON DIEGO who nears his target intent on Monteros back --
ELENA disembarks from a second long boat As she moves up the

beach a scent catches her attention She investigates plucks a
bloom from a manzanita bush
Diego draws his arm back the blade glinting --

ELENA (0S)
Father

As one Diego and Montero turn --
Recognition shock fills Diegos face
Smiling Elena hurries toward them
Diego stares frozen as his daughter approaches --
DIEGO
(a whisper)

- Dios Mio

-- but then Elena goes past Diego to Montero Diego follows her
with his eyes feeling the pain and loss of two decades

MONTERO
Gentlemen Allow me to present my
daughter Elena

Hector bows Don Luizs expression betrays him hes startled by
the claim But he accepts it and bows

DON LUIZ
I am honored Seforita

Diego watches his heart breaking
Love takes Elenas hand Their eyes meet

LOVE
Elena -- your beauty is always
welcome Particularly in this
barbarous place

MONTERO
It would be welcome anywhere

ELENA
Father please -- his compliment
was flattering enough But thank
you for leaping to my defense
(kisses his cheek)
What would I do without you

The dagger drops from Diegos hand His eyes show realization he
cannot kill Montero He stumbles fades into the crowd

ELENA
Father what is this flower It
smells very familiar

LOVE
Thats manzanita But you must be
mistaken about its familiarity
Its native to California

Elena frowns puzzled Don Luiz ushers them all up the beach

DON LUIZ
Come with me Don Montero Ive
had your hacienda prepared for
your arrival

Love nearly steps on something --
The abandoned DAGGER He picks it up examines it Glances
suspiciously into the crowds

CUT TO

EXT COASTLINE - ROCKY SLOPE - DAY

The site of Joaquins death Empty Quiet Alejandro appears
exhausted He ties his horse to the deadfall -- and sees
Joaquins sword Stares at it a long moment

DRIED BLOOD stains the rocks where Joaquins body lay Alejandro
kneels beside the spot A FLASH OF LIGHT catches his eye
Sunlight glints off of something

THE MEDALLION
Alejandro picks it up -- and cant hold back his tears Alone
on the rocky slope he cries his body hunched in mourning

EXT TOWN SQUARE - CANTINA - DAY

The cantina is a glorified lean-to open view to the street and
town square Diego steps in goes straight to the
plank-and-barrel bar Tosses coins down in front of a greasy
BARTENDER

DIEGO
Tequila

The Bartender pours Diego gulps it Gestures for another The
Bartender pours Diego nurses this one

ALEJANDRO (0S)
More whiskey

Alejandro is sitting at one of the tables Bleary-eyed Joaquins
sword is on the table wrapped in a blanket
The Bartender carries a bottle over Alejandro looks up Lifts
his glass waiting

BARTENDER
Money first

Alejandro shrugs digs in his pockets Comes up empty The
Bartender shakes his head in disgust starts to move away

Alejandro grabs his arm

ALEJANDRO
How about this

He displays the MEDALLION The Bartender appraises it

BARTENDER
Silver

ALEJANDRO
(hes not sure)

Sure

The Bartender considers Pours Reaches for the medallion --

A HAND closes around it Diegos He takes it from Alejandro

BARTENDER
Hey --

Diego hands him some coins The Bartender thinks about saying
something but Diegos gaze discourages him He moves away

DIEGO
Where did you get this

Alejandro doesnt look up

ALEJANDRO
It was my brothers Hes dead

He drinks Stares at the sword
ALEJANDRO (CONTD)
(to himself a vow)
And the man who killed him will

die by his sword

Diego regards the young man through narrow eyes He pulls back a
corner of the blanket looks at the sword

DIEGO
You seek revenge

ALEJANDRO
Go away

Alejandro turns his chair away
DIEGO
Be careful young man Revenge

can have a very high cost

Suddenly Alejandro sits bolt upright staring Diego follows his
gaze --

CAPTAIN LOVE rides across the square reins up Dismounts Takes
the bag from his saddle Pauses to speak to a soldier

Alejandro rises He grabs the sword walks away from the table
without a backward glance

EXT TOWN SQUARE - DAY
Diego catches up to Alejandro

DIEGO
Dont be a fool

Alejandro shoves him aside Grips the swords handle

DIEGO (CONTD)
Do you even know how to use that

thing

ALEJANDRO
The pointy end goes in the other
guy

Diego grabs Alejandro by the elbow in a come-along hold
Alejandro tries to shake him off but cant Diego twists
Alejandros arm pulls him into an alley --

EXT TOWN SQUARE - ALLEY - DAY

Diego swings Alejandro against a wall

ALEJANDRO
What the hell are you doing

DIEGO
Saving your life

ALEJANDRO
Get out of my way

He tries to push past Diego Diego jabs him in the chest with
cane assumes a fencers stance

DIEGO
Get through me

Alejandro stares at him in disbelief Then shrugs shakes the
blanket off his sword Swings to knock the cane aside Diego

deceives the blade -- theres no contact though Diego barely
moved Alejandro tries again -- again Diego deceives him

Angry Alejandro attacks a series of brute-strength slashes

his

Diego parries with little effort They disengage Alejandro looks

at him with respect He tries a straight thrust --

Diego parries then envelopes Alejandros blade disarming him

The sword flips into the air --
Diego trips Alejandro with his cane catches the sword --

Alejandro finds himself flat on his back sword tip at his
throat He stares up at Diego amazed

DIEGO
Deception parry envelopment
(presses the tip into
Alejandros throat)
Would you care to see a thrust

ALEJANDRO

(swallows )
No please

Diego drops to a knee beside Alejandro
DIEGO
You want to kill that man I can

teach you

Alejandro narrows his eyes peering at the old man

ALEJANDRO
A bargain has two sides whats
mine

DIEGO

If you prove yourself an apt
enough pupil I may have need of
you But until then -- no more
questions unless they concern the
sword Understood
Alejandro considers Decides

ALEJANDRO
If it means Ill be able to kill
that bastard Anything

Diego nods then hauls Alejandro to his feet Diego extends the
sword to Alejandro

DIEGO
A fine weapon It should be
better cared for
ALEJANDRO
(hell do anything)
Ill clean it

Diego nods satisfied

DIEGO
Come along

ALEJANDRO
Where are we going

DIEGO
Thats a question

He moves away Pause Takes the medallion from his pocket
DIEGO (CONTD)
Here Take better care of this
too
He tosses it back to Alejandro who catches it Holds it for a
moment Then slips it around his neck follows Diego

EXT SECRET CAVE - NIGHT

Diego disappears behind the waterfall Alejandro gives it a wary
once-over then follows

INT SECRET CAVE - NIGHT

A short passage gives way to a huge cave Lit by moonlight
through the waterfall it has a strange otherworldly look

A torch FLARES to life lit by Diego Alejandro gasps

Diego stands on a forty-by-forty marble dais in the middle of the
cave Alejandro mounts the steps staring in awe
The dais surface is inlaid with an intricate design several
circles within a large circle with various lines of radii
intersecting It is the same design as on the medallion although
the one on the floor is more complex

Alejandro lifts the medallion from inside his shirt The two
designs match although the one on the floor is more complex

ALEJANDRO
Are you Zorro
DIEGO
I told you -- no questions

Alejandro surveys the cave There is a cot and meager supplies
There is a rack of swords a grinding wheel an armorers bench
Zorros saddle partly restored

ALEJANDRO
What is this place What are we
doing here

DIEGO
I can tell youre going to be an
obedient student
(he considers sighs)
When you were a child Rafaél
Montero was the Viceroy of
California Do you remember

ALEJANDRO
Yes

DIEGO
He has returned That can only
mean ill for the people of
California

ALEJANDRO
How much worse can it get

DIEGO
Montero counts among his
confidants the alcalde Don Luiz --
and Captain Harrison Love
(beat)
Much worse

ALEJANDRO
And you are going to do what

DIEGO
We We will find out what has
prompted his return We will
discover the truth And we will
stop him

ALEJANDRO
(sure of it now)
You are Zorro

DIEGO
No Im just an old man
(sharp)
Now get up here

Alejandro starts at the command -- but obeys Diego takes
Alejandros sword uses it as a pointer

DIEGO

This is the training circle of the
Spanish Sword School as
prescribed by the masters Carranza
and Narvaez This circle is your
world your very life Whatever
occurs within this circle is
crucial to your existence
Outside of it

(beat)
There is nothing outside of it

ALEJANDRO
But Love is --

DIEGO
There is nothing outside of it
As your mastery of the sword
increases your circle expands --
your world becomes larger
Alejandro is a bit skeptical -- but doesnt care

ALEJANDRO
When do we begin

DIEGO

We have begun

Alejandro reaches for his sword Diego holds it away

DIEGO
What are you doing

ALEJANDRO
If Im going to learn swordplay
Im going to need a sword

Diego stares at him Shrugs Hands him the sword

DIEGO
Very well Show me a lunge

Alejandro complies Badly His front foot is too far forward
Diego WHACKS it with his cane

DIEGO
Too wide move your foot back

Alejandro drags the foot back his heel SQUEAKING on the floor
Unsatisfied Diego WHACKS it again Alejandro drags it back a bit
more Diego nods

DIEGO
Turn your knee out Out
(he whacks the knee)
Straighten up --
(whacks his side)
I want a lunge not a remise

He walks around Alejandro inspecting And then Diego reaches out
with his cane and taps Alejandro lightly in the chest

Alejandro cant hold the lunge Almost in slow motion he
topples The sword CLATTERS across the floor Diego picks it up
Looks down at Alejandro

DIEGO
Ill keep this until you need it

INT SECRET CAVE - VARIOUS

Alejandro stands with his feet on two parallel lines Diego SNAPS
his fingers cueing Alejandros advances and retreats Diego
stops Points Alejandros stance is now too wide He returns his
feet to the lines Diego resumes snapping

Alejandro exercises lunge from a squat return again Diego
works on the sword at the foot-operated grinding wheel Alejandro
stops Rub his sore thighs Diego stops grinding -- but doesnt
turn No matter Alejandro resumes the drill Diego resumes
grinding

CLOSE ON Diego and Alejandro staring grimly at one another

circling slowly as if locked in duel corps a corps A WIDE SHOT
reveals the two men embraced dancing along the radii

The footwork drill again but now Diego snaps a whip at
Alejandros feet prompting his advances and retreats Diego
stops points Again Alejandros stance is too wide

Alejandro advances and retreats A length of cord now binds his
feet keeping his stance correct

Diego CRACKS the whip Following a radius Alejandro retreats on
a circle he turns executes a fleche advances on another
circle turns executes a balestra Stops A quick silent prayer
-- and looks at his feet

His stance is perfect He grins Diego WHACKS him with his cane

DIEGO
Never look at your feet Dont
think about your feet

ALEJANDRO
You seem pretty occupied with
them

Diego ignores the barb He holds the spadroon out

DIEGO
Lets see if youre ready for the
sword

Alejandro takes it examines it in wonderment Diego has cleaned
up the sword sharpened it It shines
Alejandro practices a few swipes

DIEGO
No no no Not like that

He tries to reposition Alejandros hand on the hilt

DIEGO
Dont hold it too loosely -- but
dont crush it either Hold it
-- hold it the way youd hold a
woman

Alejandro tries to adjust his grip Gives Diego a sidelong
glance Hes not getting it Diego watches him fumble

DIEGO
(exasperated)
Hold it the way youd hold

yourself

Alejandro immediately grips the sword correctly

DIEGO
(not surprised)
Perfect
(beat)
And now we begin with the parry
primero It evolves naturally
from unsheathing the sword

He demonstrates with his cane Alejandro attempts it -- wrong --
and gets WHACKED for his trouble Diego shakes his head

DIEGO
This will take a lot of work

EXT ESTATE - DAY

Monteros hacienda Huge palatial Bell towers rise above
fountains and archways surrounded by manicured gardens

INTEXT ESTATE - COURTYARD - DAY
Montero and Don Luiz walk through a grand tiled courtyard
Stairs lead to an overhanging gallery On one wall PAINTERS fill

in the rough outlines of a map of North America

A huge round table dominates the courtyard A WOODWORKER carves a
design into the tabletop a stylized bull and bear

DON LUIZ
Every cabellero in California has
agreed to attend the junta And
the governor as well

(fishing)
Does the house meet with your
approval
MONTERO
Yes -- if the work is done on

time I would prefer not to
include laborers on the guest list

Through an archway Montero spies Elena on horseback riding at
full gallop He smiles -- but it becomes a look of dismay She
rides astride the horse rather than sidesaddle

MONTERO
ELENA

The joy drains out of her face She reins the horse up Montero
strides toward her Don Luiz trailing

MONTERO (CONTD)
That is not a proper way for a
lady to ride

ELENA
Yes Father

MONTERO
If you dont care about my
feelings at least have the
courtesy not to offend Don Luiz

ELENA
Im sorry My apologies Don
Luiz

Montero glares at her sternly She turns so she sits sidesaddle
adjusts her skirts primly Montero nods She urges the horse
forward in a sedate trot

DON LUIZ
A daughter can be trying at times

MONTERO
They are women after all
(a sigh)

I keep hoping shell find a
suitable husband

DON LUIZ
Perhaps Captain Love

MONTERO
Captain Love has his merits but
- truth be told Id prefer she
meet a more cultured Spanish
gentleman

EXT TOWN SQUARE - SIDE ALLEY - DAY
ON ALEJANDRO slumped in the back of small mule-drawn wagon Hat
low on his face Clean-shaven now Even so hes clearly not a

gentleman

Around the corner there is a commotion men yelling the whinny
of a high-spirited horse

LOVE (0S)
Be careful you idiots

That gets Alejandros attention He leaps from the wagon goes to
investigate

EXT TOWN SQUARE - DAY

Three Indians are wrangling a horse A HUGE BLACK STALLION It
rears and bucks They can barely hang onto the riatas around the
horses neck Alejandro stays in the shadows Love and Corporal
Lopez watch the Indians

LOVE
They know nothing about handling a
horse Are you sure theyre
Indians
(Lopez shrugs)
Apaches Now they know horses
Fierce warriors too Too bad
there arent any Apaches in California
LOPEZ
(he doesnt mind)
Yes sir A real shame
Love shakes his head strides away -- toward Alejandro
Alejandros fists clench -- hes ready to get his revenge right

now

DIEGO
(from behind)
I told you to wait in the wagon

Alejandro looks back at him Love passes without a glance at the
pair

DIEGO
Havent you learned anything If
hed spotted you --

ALEJANDRO
He didnt even look at me

DIEGO
Good thing too Youd be
reunited with your brother if he
had

ALEJANDRO
He wont recognize me -- without
my beard --

DIEGO
The beard has nothing to do with
it Its your anger Your
hatred It marks you as an enemy

Alejandro doesnt want to hear it Diego is insistent

DIEGO (CONTD)
You can never give anything away
Show your opponents only what you
want them to see

ALEJANDRO
Hell I want him to see hell

Diego grabs Alejandros shoulders turns him toward the square
where the Indians wrestle with the horse

DIEGO
Look at that horse At its eyes
Your eyes are like that -- fiery

violent You cannot let your eyes
betray you Ever

Alejandro nods impatiently -- hes got it He watches the horse
Corporal Lopez snaps a whip at the Indians

LOPEZ
Take it to the cuartel Ill
break it myself

ALEJANDRO
A magnificent animal
(baiting Diego)
He looks like Zorros horse
doesnt he Maybe his bloodline

DIEGO
(cant help but smile)
If the stories of Tornado are
true therere probably whole
herds of black horses out there

Diego walks away Alejandro moves to follow -- and something
catches his eye a peddlers stand with a display of brightly
colored silk cloth But Alejandro is only interested in one
thing

A black scarf

EXT CUARTEL - NIGHT

A military barracksstablescorral Lights in the barracks
windows

A SHADOWY FIGURE moves toward the cuartel Suddenly the figure
whirls freezes a RIDER bears down on him --

The rider reins up short ELENA She is shocked Before her is
ALEJANDRO In his version of the ZORRO outfit Striking They
stand there staring at each other A palpable electricity
And then he SMILES It startles her

Zorro lifts a finger to his lips Shhh
Elena narrows her eyes unsure

Her horse whinnies shuffles nervously Zorro catches its bridle
-- and makes the Shhh gesture to the horse as well
Elena cant help but smile at that

Zorro grins up at Elena
ZORRO
Be careful Seforita There are
dangerous men about
He tips his hat Then slips into the darkness
Elena watches him go and toys with the neckline of her dress

a little warm She catches herself doing it She feels ashamed
Angry with herself she urges her horse forward --

-- toward the small mission that stands across the square the
church doors open

INT STABLES - NIGHT

In a stall are the three Indians from the town square chained
to the stable wall They look scared defeated The stable door
CREAKS open -- and Zorro slips in

OLD INDIAN
A bandit breaking into jail

INDIAN 2
What more could they steal from
us

OLD INDIAN
The Night Ghost has returned
Zorro is here to save us

Zorro sees their predicament shakes his head

ZORRO
Sorry -- Im just here for a
horse

He spots the black stallion Zorro takes bridle and reins from a
peg on the wall enters the horses stall The horse is finicky
but Zorro murmurs to him fits the reins over his head Spies a
saddle thrown over the stable wall

OLD INDIAN
Please sefior They are going to
make us disaparecidos

INDIAN 2

Hes not Zorro Hes just a horse
thief

Zorro saddles the horse talking softly in his ear Leads him
from the stall Then he tries to mount

The horse EXPLODES bucking wildly --

Several stalls are SMASHED open horses running out The black
horse leaps out the door Zorros head hits the frame

EXT CUARTEL - NIGHT

The horse BUCKS violently Incredibly Zorro hangs on The horse
is searching for an exit Too much fence He sees the lighted
windows of the cuartel Heads for them

ZORRO
Whoa WHOA

Corporal Lopez cocks and uncocks a pistol and swigs tequila as a
SOLDIER bandages Lopezs bleeding leg

CORPORAL LOPEZ
Im going to kill that horse

SOLDIER
What will you tell Captain Love

CORPORAL LOPEZ
The truth -- it hurt a leg It
had to be shot

He hears a noise tilts his head listening
Suddenly THE HORSE CRASHES through the window taking a good
part of the wall with it

PANDEMONIUM as soldiers scurry for safety --
Zorros head cracks against the roof beams as the horse bucks

It spins knocking tables and chairs into soldiers --
Lopez dives beneath a bunk --
Zorro finally flies off lands face-to-face with A STRONG BOX --
the one the Muriettas previously stole The lids ajar the gold
ingots are visible

Zorros eyes go wide He grabs a few ingots stuffs them into
his pockets He wants more He glances around -- spots a lariat
Loops it a few times around the strong box --

A shot rings off the box Soldiers move toward Zorro --

Zorro grabs pistols from racks on the wall FIRING and dropping
them with lightning speed even as he ties the rope off on the
horses saddle horn Zorro leaps on --

The horse starts BUCKING AGAIN It rears and spins -- and gets

caught between two support beams Behind them a soldier raises a
pistol --

Zorro sees him draws his sword but cant reach the soldier
The horse sees him too --

-- and KICKS smashing the soldier backwards

The horse twists cracking the support beams freeing itself
The BEAMS CREAK -- and then GIVE WAY --

EXT CUARTEL - NIGHT

-- the building is COLLAPSING AROUND THEM as Zorro and the horse
leap out the door --

-- which is too low Zorro is knocked backward off the horse He
rolls to his feet in time to see --

THE HORSE galloping away dragging the strongbox behind him

ZORRO

He glances back soldiers pick their way out of the debris as
broken lanterns set it afire They spot him He RUNS --

Zorro grabs him puts a hand over his mouth Felipe struggles --
than sees his assailant clearly for the first time

ZORRO

He removes his hand Felipe isnt angry far from it

FELIPE
If that mask means what it used to

He pulls shut the outer doors bars them

FELIPE (CONTD)

you than theyve been to me

INT CHURCH - CHAPEL - NIGHT
A modest chapel Pews altar crucifix

FELIPE
Ill try to send your pursuers off
chasing phantoms

ZORRO
They may not like that

FELIPE
The Lord will grant us shelter
from adversity

From outside comes the sound of pursuit Banging on the exterior
door

FELIPE (CONTD)
But a good hiding place cant
hurt

He exits hurriedly shuts the chapel doors behind him Zorro
glances around the chapel Spots --

THE CONFESSIONAL Its a cloth-roofed floor-to-ceiling job that
almost reaches the choir loft Zorro slips into the

father-confessors side He sighs leans his head back --

since my last confession

ZORRO
How many sins could you have

He can see only her

Oh the fourth commandment I
thought you said um a
different one

ELENA
I try to behave properly -- the
way my father wants me to But

ZORRO
Please Go on

ELENA
When I was young I sought out the
company of Gypsies I learned
to hunt -- and fence --

And I hate to ride sidesaddle
(this is the hardest)

And just now I saw -- there was
a man

Shes shifted behind the screen -- now only her lips are visible
She smiles excitedly
ELENA (CONTD)
I think he was a bandit
ZORRO
Really Black mask that sort of
thing

Yes And he looked at me -- I
mean when I looked at him
Padre I felt like I was on fire

Zorro is happily astonished -- and knows how she feels

ZORRO
You felt like the ocean was
roaring in your ears

ELENA
Yes -- exactly --
ZORRO
Like you couldnt draw a breath

ELENA
Yes

He leans forward his forehead against the screen

ZORRO
And you wondered how that face
would look laughing or
sleeping or bathed in the soft
glow of moonlight

ELENA
(a whisper)
Yes
(suddenly aware of
whats been said)

Who are you

There is a commotion outside the chapel doors

LOVE (0S)

Zorro pats the horse gently on the neck
ZORRO
We make an excellent team

THE INDIANS hurry past him
OLD INDIAN
Thank you -- I knew you wouldnt

ZORRO
Think nothing of it

A final wall falls over Lopez still beneath the bunk realizes
he is exposed He looks up at Zorro

CORPORAL LOPEZ
Who -- Who are you

Zorro cant resist He draws his sword Lopez flinches With a
fluid stroke Zorro carves aZ on an adobe wall

He looks at Lopez expectantly Lopez examines the Z puzzled

INT SECRET CAVE - MORNING

Diego paces on the dais Turns at the sound of --
ZORRO on the black horse rides into the cave Diego gasps --
its like seeing a ghost

DIEGO
What the hell were you thinking
Did I give you permission to go
out And dressed like that --

Alejandro strips off his mask slips off the horse

ALEJANDRO
I needed a horse
DIEGO
Youre a fool --

Alejandro yanks the rope dragging the strong box into the cave
He snaps it open revealing the gold ingots

ALEJANDRO
I got the horse I got the gold
I got away Hell I even rescued
some Indians

Diego looks at the gold genuinely shocked He picks up several
ingots thinking Turns to the seething Alejandro

DIEGO
Good work

Alejandro wasnt expecting that

ALEJANDRO
Thank you

DIEGO
Montero is convening a junta of
the dons next week You are going
to be there

ALEJANDRO
And how are you going to make that
happen Im no don

(angry)

I am tired of waiting It will
not be a particularly satisfying
revenge to watch Love die of old
age I could have killed him
tonight Im ready

DIEGO
Youre right

ALEJANDRO
DIEGO
You are no don

He takes something from a table --

DIEGO (CONTD)
Ive made you a swordsman Now I
must make you a gentleman
He holds out something to Alejandro
A FORK

Alejandro looks at it Stares at Diego Then resigned he
reaches out and takes the fork holding it in his fist

DIEGO
Dont hold it like that Like
this
(manipulates

Alejandros hand)
This will take a lot of work

EXT CUARTEL - MORNING

Montero and Love inspect the still-smoldering wreckage of the
building Soldiers round up horses salvage what they can

LOVE
The priest aided him From now
on hell be ministering to a
whole new flock of lost lambs
(musing)
How could one man cause so much
destruction

Montero comes upon the Z slashed into the wall He freezes
wide with shock and fear

LOVE
Oh yes that He called himself
Zorro The fox

(appraising the Z)
Just a bit ostentatious

Montero reaches out and touches the Z feeling the scarred
clay He withdraws his hand It is shaking He clenches it

MONTERO
Find him Find the man who did
this and kill him
(at Love)
I want him DEAD

Love takes a step back from him Soldiers stare at the outburst
Montero unconsciously rubs his neck where the scar of the Z is
hidden

MONTERO

And get that letter off
the wall

He spins and leaves Love glances at the Z -- then back at
Montero curiously

EXT ESTATE - DAY 58

Guests arrive women in coaches husbands riding beside them
their horses bedecked in decorated tack and saddles Servants
trail behind them Grooms provide Old World valet parking

The guests move along a carpet of red and yellow flowers to the
entrance where they present their invitations and are greeted by
Montero and Elena

The GOVERNOR a sour little man and his wife arrive

MONTERO
Governor Its an honor
Pleasant journey I hope

GOVERNOR
No thanks to that damned horse
All I want is chair with a very
thick cushion --

Something is causing a stir at the far end of the carpet The
arriving guests part allowing Montero and Elena to see --

ALEJANDRO Don Alejandro Wearing silver-trimmed cabellero
finery astride Tornado also in spectacular tack Dashing
Behind him Diego arrives on a donkey

Alejandro dismounts enjoying the impact hes making As they
move down the carpet he and Diego confer surreptitiously

DIEGO
Remember -- youre the son of
Bartolo Castillo

ALEJANDRO
Theres no chance his real son
will show up is there Or dad
himself for that matter

DIEGO
No Bartolo has been dead for
years And he and his wife had no
children

Alejandro stops short Diego covers the pause by brushing
Alejandros jacket

ALEJANDRO

Then how the hell is this going to
work

DIEGO
He did have many mistresses Just
behave as Ive taught you Youll
win Monteros confidence
(nudges Alejandro forward)

ALEJANDRO
Great What about my confidence

DIEGO
Stop worrying Im certain that
if you want to you can be one
charming bastard

They reach the vestibule A servant holds out a hand for
Alejandros invitation He ignores him strides to Montero

ALEJANDRO
Good evening Don Montero I am
Don Alejandro Castillo y Garcia

Alejandro takes Monteros hand dips one knee and inclines his
head in greeting Montero is surprised -- then beams

MONTERO
I havent seen that in years --
The formal greeting of the Spanish
Court --

ALEJANDRO
My late father was a stickler for
etiquette

MONTERO
And who was your father

ALEJANDRO
Don Bartolo Castillo

He holds his hand out imperiously to Diego who places a land
grant document in it

ALEJANDRO

(a rote introduction)
My servant Bernardo

Ive just arrived from Spain -- by

California That it could be a
land of opportunity -- for a man
of vision

MONTERO
And youre a man of vision

Montero cocks an eyebrow smiles Diego is pleased and proud

Alejandros performance

DIEGO
Youre not here to sample every

ALEJANDRO
Good help is so hard to find

ELENA
My father has asked me to invite
you to his table

ALEJANDRO
Splendid

He takes her arm She allows it She leads him to a table where
Montero sits with Don Luiz Hector and Love and the Governor
One of those party conversations that drifts between seriousness
and levity

Alejandro and Elena arrive in time to hear

HECTOR
Hes not a threat How could he
be Hed be an old man by now

MONTERO
As old as I am Don Hector

Hector stammers Montero and the others laugh Alejandro helps
Elena into her chair Love doesnt like that

MONTERO

Don Luiz Don Hector the Governor
- And this is Captain Love
Captain Love is in command of the
presidio

ALEJANDRO
Pleased to meet you Captain
Strange for an American to command
a Mexican presidio

LOVE
These are strange days we live in
sir

ALEJANDRO

Sir I like that The manners
are the only thing Ive ever
admired about the military I
have no taste for it otherwise

LOVE
Our loss

(returns to the topic)
As I was going to say -- this may
not even be the same man After
all a mask never ages

ALEJANDRO
Ah -- were discussing the
theater A comedia de capa y
espada perhaps

DON LUIZ

No Were discussing Zorro

ALEJANDRO
Really Fox-hunting eh All
those noisy dogs --

LOVE
(smirks)
This is a man who calls himself
Zorro
DON LUIZ

Twenty years ago he helped
agitate the peasants to revolt
against Spain

Alejandro looks down at his table setting --
It is a VAST ARRAY He is bewildered Considering it all he
reaches for a piece of bread draws the butter closer

HECTOR
Maybe hell convince them to help
us throw off Mexico

Alejandros hand hovers over several different knives without a
clue as to which is which

MONTERO
And then hed just set them
against their new rulers He is
an anarchist -- nothing more

Alejandro gives up he pushes away the butter and bites into the
roll resigned to munch it dry

ELENA
I wonder would the people
embrace Zorro if there wasnt a
need for him
Theres a slight awkwardness Women should be seen

MONTERO
Elena

ELENA
(ignoring the rebuke)
Some of the servants seem
well jubilant about his return

MONTERO
Ill dismiss them immediately
(laughter)

not heard

Diego has returned with Alejandros wine He stands behind

Alejandros chair --

ELENA
They believe Zorro is one of their
own That hes their protector

Alejandro looks up sharply Hes never considered th
also looks at Elena -- but then looks away
LOVE
Fairy tales to be expected

when you talk to people beneath
your station

Diego sets the wine in front of Alejandro Alejandro
arm spilling the wine on his table setting

ALEJANDRO
You idiot Clean these and return
them to their places
(to the table)
Excuse him

at Diego

jostles his

Alejandro shoots Diego a plea with his eyes Diego realizes what
Alejandro is asking for He wipes the silverware with a napkin

returns them to their places

DIEGO
The butter knife at the top The
soup spoon here Salad fork
here bread knife entrée fork
desert fork --

The conversation continues over him The Governor we

ighs in

readjusting the big soft cushion under him as he speaks

GOVERNOR
I believe that those who govern
must always hold themselves above
the people they rule So as to
determine whats best for them

ELENA
Im not so sure Theres
something to the idea that people
can govern themselves

Shes gone too far The men dont know what to say Monteros
embarrassed He chuckles tries to cover the faux pas

MONTERO
A womans grasp of politics What
can I say

Diego rights the wine glass whispers in Alejandros ear

DIEGO
(sotto)
And the napkin goes in your lap
not tucked in the front of your
shirt

Alejandro gives him an angry glance shoos him away

ELENA
What do you think Don Alejandro
Are the people capable of guiding
their own lives

Alejandros on the spot He considers his answer
ALEJANDRO
I think that sheep will always

need shepherds

Elena scowls at him Alejandro picks up his soup spoon --
actually gives it a happy glance -- and begins to eat

DON LUIZ
Well spoken

GOVERNOR
Absolutely

Montero appraises the young man smiles Love doesnt like it
LOVE

Enough of this Were at a party
Elena -- would you care to dance
He offers her his arm Elena gives Alejandro

ELENA
Yes Absolutely

a final glare

She puts her hand on his arm -- but Montero removes it

MONTERO
Im sorry darling but I need a
few moments of Captain Loves
time Perhaps
(to Alejandro)
Don Alejandro would you indulge

Alejandro was enjoying the soup One last sip --

She considers a protest -- but Alejandro
already leading her away

ALEJANDRO

ON ALEJANDRO AND ELENA As she grudgingly allows him to lead
to a spot among the waltzing couples

ALEJANDRO
Give me a chance senorita Im

ELENA
What does that mean

ALEJANDRO
(spreads his hands)
I have no idea

Shall we

He opens his arms to her A moment and then she accepts They
begin to waltz

ON MONTERO -- who is leaving the ballroom Don Luiz in tow
Montero glances once back at Alejandro and Elena smiles -- and
then exits

Diego watching him darkly follows

INT ESTATE - HALLWAY - DAY

The music is softer distant Diego moves down the empty hallway
Pushes open a heavy wood door Glances in --

INT ESTATE - STUDY - DAY

Books empty chairs a table On the wall is a portrait of
Montero and a ten-year-old Elena He can barely stand to look at
it He pulls the door closed starts up the hall --

INT ESTATE - HALLWAY - DAY

SOUNDS of FOOTSTEPS approaching Diego reverses direction
smoothly ducks back into the study --

INT ESTATE - STUDY - DAY

-- and pulls up short Standing in the previously empty study are
Montero and Don Luiz looking down examining a map

DON LUIZ
If Santa Anna ever learns the
truth --

MONTERO

(angry at Diego)
What do you want

Diego gapes Where did they come from But he watches as Don Luiz
folds the map protectively puts it in an oilskin pouch

DIEGO
I uh The kitchen For more
morcilla --
Diegos eyes sweep the room No other doors or windows

MONTERO
Its on the other side of the
dining hall Go

DIEGO
Muchas gracias sefior

Diego bows and backs away
INT ESTATE - BALLROOM - DAY

Alejandro and Elena waltz together beautifully The song ends
Light applause from the dancers The orchestra begins a fandango
Elena turns away He catches her arm

ALEJANDRO
It would be a shame to quit now
We seem to be in step Elena

ELENA
Footwork and spirit are not the
same thing

ALEJANDRO
Does that mean youre afraid you
cant keep up

He strikes a stance -- throwing down the gauntlet A moments
consideration and then she takes up the challenge

This dance is much hotter than the first Alejandro dips Elena
pulls her close She gasps at the contact -- then returns it
sensually They become more bold more erotic with complete
disregard for the other dancers The other dancers step aside
leaving the floor to Alejandro and Elena

Love looks on in disgust

Diego comes back into the ballroom -- and stops short He sees
the way Alejandro is dancing with his daughter -- and doesnt
like it

Montero and Don Luiz come in behind him -- and Montero also stops

short Hes not too happy at what he sees either

Montero and Diego wear the exact same expression that of a
protective father
DON LUIZ
Shocking

Both Montero and Diego snap a look at him Then Montero pushes
Diego aside moves toward the couple

A crescendo the dance ends with them tightly embraced breathing
hard barely within decorum

ALEJANDRO
You see Elena We arent so
different Not at heart

ELENA
So now you know my secret You
can keep a secret cant you

ALEJANDRO
Im getting better at it

He spots Montero coming his way He disengages from Elena
immediately becomes the height of propriety

ALEJANDRO
Thank you for the dance seforita

Shes surprised at his change in behavior He turns -- and runs
into Montero feigns surprise

ALEJANDRO (CONTD)
Don Montero You startled me --
need to catch my breath Your

daughter is a very -- spirited --
dancer
Monteros anger -- at Alejandro at least -- subsides

MONTERO

She does have a problem with
boundaries at times

Elenas eyes blaze She cant believe that Alejandro is foisting
the blame onto her -- and Montero is buying it She shoves

Alejandro aside strides from the floor

MONTERO
I apologize if you were offended

ALEJANDRO
Completely unnecessary sir

Montero accepts the absolve gratefully He claps a hand on
Alejandros shoulder

MONTERO
Don Alejandro join us in the
courtyard Theres something I
want to share with you

ALEJANDRO
What

MONTERO
A vision

Alejandro cocks his head -- then smiles
INTEXT ESTATE - COURTYARD - SUNSET

ANGLE - FROM ABOVE looking down on the huge round wooden table
the bull and bear carved beautifully into its surface

Select dons take seats of honor around the table Other dons
Alejandro among them stand in the torchlit courtyard Montero
stands beneath the mural hidden by a curtain

MONTERO
Governor fellow dons of
California Two decades ago
Spain abandoned you Left you
stranded in a sea of barbarism as
surely as if California was the
island for which it was named
(fondly)
But we can recall the golden years
of El Camino Real The fiestas
the bull and bear fights Mules
weighted with casks of mescal from
Baja
(slams his fist on the
table)
And we were the masters Not
Mexican peasants Us

MONTERO (Contd)

Montero pulls a cord The curtain drops away --

Unveiled is the completed map of North America -- showing the new
COUNTRY OF CALIFORNIA Applause and cheers

MONTERO (CONTD)
Once again we will be the silver
dons The lords of New Iberia

Some of the younger dons cry Viva Montero and Viva
California Alejandro draws a breath -- this is unbelievable

DON PERALTA rises shakily White-haired refined the oldest --
and most respected -- man in the room

DON PERALTA

The old Spanish ways are already
being lost And the United States
- we have long feared its
westward expansion They are a
nation of slavery They will
suppress the holy Catholic faith

(nods)
Don Monteros plan is our only
course

The dons applaud as Peralta settles back into his chair DON
COTA a severely-dressed reactionary reproaches Montero

DON COTA
Are you proposing revolution
Have you forgotten how Santa Anna
reacted to Texas independence
(ticking them off)
The massacre at San Antonio de
Bexar The massacre at Goliad --

Love steps forward
LOVE

(off Cotas rhythm)
-- the massacre at San Jancinto

But wait -- there was something
different about that one

TV

LOVE (Contd)
(snaps his fingers)
Thats right Texas won We
routed the Mexican Army and
captured Santa Anna himself

CRIES of approval at this Montero holds up his hands

MONTERO
Talk of revolution and massacres
is unnecessary Our secession
will be a bloodless one
Gentlemen -- we are going to buy
California from Mexico

The dons react to this with murmurs of surprise
INT ESTATE - HALLWAY - EVENING

Diego eavesdrops outside the doors to the courtyard He is
startled by Elena who comes up behind him

ELENA
Bernardo

DIEGO
Senorita -- I

He trails off face-to-face with her alone for the first time
She looks at him concerned

ELENA
Whats wrong Bernardo You look

as though youve seen a ghost

Diego lowers his head assuming a subservient role -- but also
avoiding meeting her eyes

DIEGO
Im sorry Seforita -- I must

I have to go

He hurries away down the hall Elena watches him go curious
about his reaction

INTEXT ESTATE - COURTYARD - EVENING
Torches now light the courtyard Don Cota still isnt satisfied
MONTERO
Mexico owes fifteen million pounds

to England They have debts to

DON COTA

Santa Anna has already accepted
He arrives in two days time to
sign the treaties and take
delivery of his payment

And Santa Anna is not a man who
cares for I0Us

ALEJANDRO
Except for the ones he writes
himself of course

LAUGHTER from the room One don thumps Alejandro on the back

MONTERO

Quite right Don Alejandro Some
of you have apprehensions --
understandably

(considers an idea)
Very well We will select a
representative party Meet me
here tomorrow at dawn and I will
lay all your doubts to rest

DON LUIZ
(sotto)
Is this wise

MONTERO
(waves him off)
Don Inez of course Don Cota
-- Don Peralta Don Aguilar

Governor

His eye falls on Alejandro who spreads his hands in a ‘how about
me gesture

MONTERO

And Don Alejandro -- would you
like to join us

ele
ALEJANDRO
Its why Im here

EXT MOUNTAINS - CANYON - GOLD STRIKE - DAY

ANGLE ON a line of horse-drawn COACHES coming over a rise
Black tarps have been nailed over the windows Soldiers drive
them Love and Montero accompany them on horseback

The lead coach stops Montero pulls the door open The Governor
is the first out sweating blinking in the sunlight

GOVERNOR
Finally I dont appreciate this
lack of trust Don Montero --

He shuts up looking past Montero Behind him the representative
party climbs out of the coach just as awed Alejandro is the
last out He stares --

Below the coaches is a narrow canyon the location of a busy gold
strike

Sluices bleed water from a tiny stream leaving the riverbed dry
A series of elaborate WOODEN PLATFORMS and SCAFFOLDINGS have been
constructed allowing access to mines that delve into the canyon
walls

The sluices quarries and mines are worked by MEN IN CHAINS

Men in chains crush stone Men in chains cart stone out of the
mines carry it down ladders in slings on their backs Men in
chains run the huge smelting pots and the gold ore lift -- a
large pulley-and-counterweight device that lifts the gold up out
of the valley

Alejandro steps down from the step joins the other dons staring
down taking it all in

MONTERO
Gentlemen This is the means
with which we will realize our
dream

ALEJANDRO

Gold Youve discovered gold
MONTERO

The Indians did actually -- but
they had no idea of its value

EXT DRY RIVERBED - DAY

Love addresses the dons as they climb down a stairway onto the
floor of the canyon They pass several chained INDIANS crushing
stone into slurry and running it through sluices

DON LUIZ
Since the days of Father Serra
the savages have traded gold for
food and clothing Don Montero
always believed we could find the
mother lode

LOVE
It was just a matter of persuading
the savages to help us

Alejandro scowls he can imagine how they were persuaded

DON COTA
How much is there

A PRISONER stirs a hopper of hot embers used in pouring gold
ingots He pauses exhausted -- and is CLUBBED back to work by
one of the many guards

LOVE
At first we were picking it up off
the ground Now its a matter of
digging and blasting

The Governor stares at the workers in chains their guards

DON PERALTA
These people this is slavery

LOVE
All these men are law-breakers
sir sentenced to hard labor

Alejandro scans the terrain He notices something moves casually
toward it In the mud is --

A CHILDS FOOTPRINT Tiny beside Alejandros boot He looks at
Love coldly the mystery of the ‘disappeared ones explained He
rubs out the print with his boot

ALEJANDRO
So This is the future of California

MONTERO
Exactly

Alejandro looks toward the workers -- and his eyes widen One of
the workers is staring at him Starved unshaven dirty it takes
a moment for Alejandro to recognize him --
It is THREE-FINGERED JACK

MONTERO (CONTD)
Gentleman -- We Spanish came to
the New World searching for El

Dorado
(beat)
And now

Jacks eyes widen
around -- but where can he run
Quickens his pace

He has seen Alejandro

We have found it

Alejandro glances
Jack steps toward Alejandro

mouth opening to shout something --

SOLDIER (0S)

FIRE BELOW

An EXPLOSION rocks the valley

fire erupting from a tunnel

the

blast covering the sound of Jacks shout --

WHITE SOUND as the blast ECHOES
wild-eyed criminal with a pick

Love smoothly draws his pistol

Love FIRES
yards away from Alejandro
back

Jack crawls forward
And then he dies

NORMAL SOUND fades back in Alej
corpse He reasserts control
The Governor shaken

MONTERO
(apologetic)

Blood blossoms on Jacks chest
A soldier FIRES his rifle into Jacks

To the visitors Jack is justa
running toward them --

Alejandro moves to stop him --

Jack stumbles still

an arm reaching for Alejandro --

andro stares in horror at Jacks

His gaze is unreadable
looks to Montero for an explanation

We cant allow any of the

prisoners to escape

of course

If word got out that California
was a land of gold

GOVERNOR
People from all over the world
would come

MONTERO
Yes That mustnt happen -- not

until it is our country

GOVERNOR
(hes sold)
Of course

DON COTA
I think I underestimated you Don
Montero Im in We all are

The other cabelleros nod and murmur assent

MONTERO
Thank you
(to Alejandro)
And you my fellow gachupin What
do you think

Alejandro raises an eyebrow Takes in the workers the guards
the dead man lying a few feet away

ALEJANDRO
Why a man would have to be crazy

to protest this

Montero smiles slaps Alejandros back Alejandro and the others
head back to the ladders that lead up to the coaches

Love examines JACKS BODY Glances at his OUTSTRETCHED ARM his
HAND with only THREE FINGERS

It POINTS DIRECTLY at ALEJANDRO now walking away Love watches
Alejandro suspicious now his frown deepening

EXT MOUNTAINS - CANYON - LATER

The coaches rumble away out of view as we DROP DOWN TO --
The valley floor as the body of Three-Fingered Jack is dragged
through the dirt by guards Past large rocks Around a bend

Past cage bars set into the ground --

-- where a child is staring out the LITTLE GIRL from the
Watering Station Her father THE OWNER pulls her back

MINE GUARD
Everyone -- back to work

Cage doors are opened and dozens of other workers are released
-- women children old men They are roughly shoved along

FOLLOW THE BODY as it is dragged down the valley then
unceremoniously dropped near where a MAN digs in the dirt

MINE GUARD
Another one for you Father
Better hurry up were getting
ahead of you

The Guard laughs The man looks up turns --
It is FRAY FELIPE He glances at the body

FELIPE
- te vas a eir a infierno --

The Guard WHIPS Felipe who crouches down PULL BACK as Felipe
returns to his work shoveling dirt onto a newly-dug grave Two
branches form a makeshift wooden cross

We

CONTINUE PULL BACK from Felipe and RISE UP to reveal the valley
floor -- it is nearly covered filled with dozens perhaps
hundreds of the makeshift crosses

INT ESTATE - STABLES - DAY

Diego combs Tornado Elena leads her horse in Diego looks up at
her -- then away Elena notices Diego she hands her horse off to
a groom and approaches

ELENA
Good afternoon Bernardo

DIEGO
Seforita

She strokes Tornado admiringly Diego wishes she would go away

ELENA
A magnificent animal

DIEGO
I have to finish grooming him
for my master

ELENA
How long have you served Don
Alejandro

DIEGO
Sometimes it seems interminable

Elena laughs surprised Diego immediately realizes his gaffe
tries to cover

DIEGO (CONTD)
Im sorry -- I speak out of place
ELENA
Dont worry Bernardo He wont
hear if from me
(beat)
There is something about Don
Alejandro that makes me believe he

is a man of character but it
certainly isnt in the way he
acts

DIEGO

Don Alejandro is a fine man
and he is constantly improving

Diego combs Tornado harder His words come with difficulty

DIEGO (CONTD)
But sometimes sometimes
circumstances prevent a person
from saying the things that
need to be said The things he
most wants to say

Elena considers this She picks up the brush and begins grooming
the horse beside Diego

ELENA
I think I understand Ive
felt that way

DIEGO
Have you

Almost against his will Diego regards her -- for too long
Shes aware of his gaze He cant help saying it

DIEGO
You look like your mother

Elena snaps a look at him puzzled at his familiarity

DIEGO (CONTD)
(recovering)
-- I imagine I see very little
of Don Montero in you

ELENA
(laughs)
I think hed prefer I was even
more like her She was very
obedient and always appropriate

DIEGO
Is that how he describes her But
not you Growing up you had
trouble with rules

ELENA

You have to ask Yes I was a
terror I was always

(smiles at a memory)
When I was little I hated wearing
shoes My duena would take her
eyes off me for an instant and
somehow Id have lost another
pair

(shakes her head)
I was a very willful child

DIEGO

That must have been something to
see

They share a moment a smile

DIEGO (CONTD)
What happened to your mother

Elena looks away A painful memory but one shes learned to deal

with
ELENA
She died just after I was born
I never knew her and my father

rarely speaks of her

Elena really appraises Diego Somethings been
she cant keep it inside any longer

ELENA
Bernardo -- last night I wanted
to ask you Have we ever met
In Spain perhaps

DIEGO
I havent been to Spain in
since before you were born

ELENA
Im sorry -- its just your
voice seems so familiar

bothering her

and
DIEGO
My voice

ELENA
Yes The sound of it I swear
Ive heard it before

DIEGO
It may be I just have one of
those voices
Elena considers it Finally shrugs non-comittally
ELENA
I suppose Well its very

pleasant Good day Bernardo

DIEGO
Vaya con Dios Sefiorita

She moves away toward the door Diego cant stop himself --

DIEGO (CONTD)
Senorita

She turns back to face him

DIEGO (CONTD)
Perhaps you are more like your
mother than you realize

Shes surprised She beams

ELENA
Gracias Bernardo

She exits Diego lets the comb drop from his hand Leans his
forehead against Tornado

EXT ESTATE - FRONT GATE - DAY
The dons in a celebratory mood emerge from the coaches head

for the house Alejandro is the last one out his mood is much
less ebullient

Diego waits with Tornado and his donkey Alejandro goes to him
As he checks the cinch of his saddle

ALEJANDRO
Hes discovered gold A lot of
it
Diego is surprised -- but believes it

DIEGO

Gold

(nods thinking)
Hes going to buy California from
Santa Anna -- using gold that
belongs to Santa Anna

(a mirthless laugh)
Its exactly what Id expect from
Montero

ALEJANDRO

Hes got people in chains --
working the mines He says
theyre criminals

(shakes his head)
I saw a childs footprint And my
friend Jack --

(his voice falters)
Jack was there as well

(grim)
I think I have found the
disaparecidos
DIEGO
I think that it is time for
Zorro to make another appearance
Tonight

Alejandro gives him a questioning look Before he can say

anything --

LOVE
Don Alejandro

Love comes up behind him Trailing Love are two
them POX-SCARRED and huge
LOVE
Id like a word with you

ALEJANDRO
Yes

LOVE
Not here At the cuartel

ALEJANDRO
Very well Ill meet you there

LOVE
I have a coach waiting Lets all

soldiers one

of
go together

Its not a request Alejandro takes in the huge Pox-scarred
Soldier Smiles shrugs

ALEJANDRO
If its that urgent Captain how
can I refuse

He and Diego exchange a look and then Alejandro follows the two
soldiers away Tornado snorts Love glances at him -- then does a
double-take Shakes his head moves away

EXT TOWN SQUARE - DAY

Elena moves through the square She passes a row of stalls where
Indian artisans display their wares

A very old INDIAN WOMAN tugs on Elenas skirt Smiling she
presses a yellow pafiuelo into Elenas hands

ELENA
Thank you Its beautiful

The Old Woman says something in her native tongue touches Elena
gently on the shoulder

Elena tries the pafuelo on (It is similar to the one Esperanza
wore in the opening of the movie) Elena smiles delighted with
it

ELENA

How much

Elena looks up but the Old Woman is gone Elena searches sees
the Old Woman back behind her stand speaking with a young INDIAN
GIRL Elena approaches

ELENA
How much does this cost

The Indian Girl speaks to the Old Woman who shakes her head
INDIAN GIRL
It is a gift she says In honor
of your mother
Elena is taken aback
ELENA

Tell her she must be mistaken My
mother died long ago in Spain
The Indian Girl translates The Old Woman makes a dismissive
gesture Speaks emphatically indicates Elenas face

INDIAN GIRL

She says there is no mistaking the
daughter of Esperanza and Diego de
la Vega She worked for your
mother on the de la Vega Estate

(smiles )
She says your eyes are your
mothers eyes

Elena holds the scarf out her hand trembling

ELENA
Im sorry I cannot accept this --

The Old Woman waves a hand at Elena and disappears into the back
of the stand

Elena watches her go shaken twisting the scarf in her hands
EXT DE LA VEGA HACIENDA - SUNSET

All that is left are charred overgrown ruins Elena climbs
toward them a carriage waiting on the road behind her

Elena steps into the center of what is left of the hacienda She
takes a deep breath A sudden impulse and she turns --

-- and faces what was her nursery room the spectacular view of
the distant coastline She steps into the room Beyond the
broken remains of the window is a tall bush -- manzanita

She leans down hesitantly Then breathes in its scent --
Elena slumps sits on the broken remains of a wall buries her

head in her hands Finally she lifts her head and looks around
questioning still unsure

INT CUARTEL - DAY

The Cuartel is in the midst of reconstruction Alejandro is
shoved into a chair at a desk Love sits across from him A water
pitcher and two glasses are before him

LOVE
I know your secret

ALEJANDRO
Would you care to share it with
me
Love takes one of the glasses but ignores the wine He fills it
from a container in his desk drawer out of sight from Alejandro

LOVE
Did you know that ancient warriors
would cannibalize their slain
enemies In order to absorb their
essence Their eyes in
particular were most sought
after To see through the eyes of
an enemy was a valuable thing

Love sips from his glass regards Alejandro with hooded eyes

LOVE (CONTD)
And its in a mans eyes that you
can find the true measure of his

soul
(takes another sip)

Where are my manners Would you

care for a drink

Love brings the container up suddenly and shoves it across the

table It rotates as it slides --

-- Alejandro is looking at the pickled HEAD of JOAQUIN MURIETTA

In the jar the lid off

Alejandro is startled -- but thats all No anger in his eyes

LOVE
Perhaps a different vintage

Love slides a second smaller jar forward
THREE-FINGERED JACKS three-fingered hand

ALEJANDRO
Interesting taste you have
(nods at Joaquin)
Who was he An irate husband
maybe

LOVE
An enemy He has a brother out
there somewhere Who will share
his fate

Alejandro remains unfazed In fact --

ALEJANDRO
Well I wish you luck

It contains

-- he picks up the jar containing Joaquins head

ALEJANDRO
To your health

-- and DRINKS BRINE from it His eyes never leave Loves Love
narrows his eyes at him

LOVE
You may not be Muriettas brother
-- but you are more than you
pretend to be

ALEJANDRO
Am I Maybe someday Ill see what
I look like through your eyes
Captain Love

With that Alejandro pats his lips with his handkerchief rises
saunters out

EXT ESTATE - HILLSIDE - NIGHT
CLOSE ON Alejandros eyes He looks out at --
The Estate Serene under the bright stars He and Diego survey it

from a secluded vantage point Tornado is tied to a tree A
canister of kerosene sits to one side

DIEGO
There must be a secret room off
the study Search it -- somewhere
in there they have a map of the

mine

(off Alejandros look)
Im certain Its all the proof
we need of Monteros treachery

ALEJANDRO
Montero What about Love
(seeing it)
He kept my brothers head In a
jar He
(he falters)
He is a monster

DIEGO
Alejandro -- Listen to me There
is more at stake here than your
revenge California must not fall
under Monteros rule We must
expose him his true nature to
everyone who loves and respects
him

(beat)
Please

Alejandro considers his words
He ties on the ZORRO MASK Calming down

ALEJANDRO
Yes very well

Diego squeezes his shoulder questioningly Alejandro
okay
DIEGO
Go over the wall at my signal

ALEJANDRO
Whats the signal

DIEGO
(smiles)
Youll know

EXT ESTATE - OUTER WALL - NIGHT

Zorro moves silently from shadow to shadow Crouches
him several SOLDIERS patrol the estate perimeter

INTEXT ESTATE - COURTYARD - NIGHT

nods

Ahead

of

Montero and Love sit at the table Before them is the oilskin

pouch Spread out is the map to the mines Love gazes at the

wall at the huge map of North America above them

LOVE
How long until we turn toward
the United States

MONTERO
There will be a gold rush of
course Well have population and
wealth enough to raise an army

LOVE
(anticipating it)
How far do we go

Montero makes a sweeping gesture across the large map

MONTERO
All the way to the east coast
Harrison Just think of it as
(he grins)
Manifest destiny

Love raises a wine glass in a toast Starts to drink --
Suddenly SHOUTS are heard Cries of FUEGO ring out --

EXT ESTATE - GATE - NIGHT
Monteros stricken expression is lit by a burning glow --

Across the valley is a huge BURNING Z OF FLAMES It takes up an
entire hillside white smoke billowing into the black sky

MONTERO
(to himself)
- its happening again

Behind him Love shouts orders Horses THUNDER past as soldiers
ride to investigate --

EXT ESTATE - OUTER WALL - NIGHT

Zorro sees the burning Z grins The soldiers in front of him
move away from their posts Zorro slips over the wall

INTEXT ESTATE - COURTYARD - NIGHT

Zorro moves quickly to the courtyard He sees papers on the
wooden table Goes to investigate

It is the map Zorro cant believe his good fortune He moves
toward it -- hears Love approaching

LOVE (0S)
Back to your posts Immediately

Zorro curses under his breath slips into the shadows --
INT ESTATE - STUDY - NIGHT

Zorro backs into the study crouches He notices the portrait of
Montero and Elena

Suddenly SOUNDS of FOOTSTEPS approaching Zorro looks around
searching the room He runs his hands along the wall Pulls on a
bookshelf VOICES can be heard now --

An idea hits him

He goes back to the portrait Adjusts it --

A soft click A bookshelf swings away from the wall A secret
passage lies beyond -- from within comes the shimmer of gold --
INT ESTATE - ROOM OF GOLD - NIGHT

Zorro moves into the room awed Stacks of GOLD INGOTS GOLD
CONQUISTADOR ARMOR One wall stacked with STRONGBOXES like the
one stolen earlier -- enough gold to buy a country

Central to it all is the portrait of a woman Surrounded by
golden splendor lit by candles the room is almost a shrine

ZORRO
Elena

But it is not Elena Its her mother The lower right corner is
burned away but the name plate is still there Esperanza de la
Vega Zorro frowns

He examines the armor touches the helmet leaving it askew

Outside from the study approaching VOICES can be heard
Zorros head snaps up He looks around for a way out --

INT ESTATE - ROOM OF GOLD - MOMENTS LATER

ON MONTERO AND LOVE as they enter --
The room of gold is EMPTY Zorro has disappeared Montero
carries the oilskin pouch that contains the map

MONTERO
Santa Anna will be here at dawn
We cannot risk discovery

LOVE
The mine is nearly played out
Weve found no new veins in
months We could destroy it

MONTERO
Yes Destroy it Better safe
than sorry

LOVE
And the slaves

MONTERO
(brusque)

No survivors

LOVE
Always a good policy

Montero puts the pouch inside an ornate chest Our ANGLE favors
the gold conquistador armor -- is Zorro hiding there

Love has noticed the askew helmet on the armor He frowns

Love moves to it Pulls out his sword Oh no Swings the sword
hard through the neck CHOPPING OFF the helmet It CLATTERS to

the ground -- the armor is EMPTY
LOVE
As you say better safe than
sorry

He scans the room suspiciously Follows Montero out

TILT UP We see Zorro hidden in the shadows of the ceiling
holding himself spread-eagled between two beams He drops to the

floor opens the chest Grabs the oilskin pouch --

INT ESTATE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Zorro slips out of the study Hears Loves voice
LOVE (0S)

I want the house and grounds
searched Twice

Love comes into view with several soldiers Zorro backs away
around a corner into hiding He stuffs the oilskin pouch into

his shirt looks up --

A mirror is opposite him Zorro curses as he sees Loves

reflection just as Love spots him --

LOVE
There he is

Next to Love a Soldier takes aim FIRES Zorros image SHATTERS
of course as the bullet hits the mirror Love rolls his eyes at

the Soldiers stupidity slaps him

LOVE
After him

The chase is on Zorro bolts heads UP A WIDE FLIGHT OF STAIRS

Love and the soldiers after him He turns a corner --

-- and comes face-to-face with Montero Monteros eyes go wide
horrified at the sight of ZORRO a specter from the past He

staggers puts a hand out to the wall

Zorro spins and leaps to a window--

INTEXT ESTATE - COURTYARD - NIGHT

Zorro sidesteps a Soldier chasing him out the window

goes over the edge but manages to grab onto the sill
hands He makes a convenient ladder

the Soldier
with both

Zorro climbs down him holding onto his ankles but cant quite
reach the next balcony With his sword Zorro cuts the Soldiers
belt His pants drop catch on his ankles Hanging from the
pants Zorro swings to the balcony --

-- where another Soldier appears Zorro leaps down to a wooden
crossbeam which supports a bell above the courtyard The Soldier
jumps onto the beam after him --

Zorro is knocked off-balance he hooks a leg spins around the
beam comes back up the other side and hits the soldier The
soldier falls off the beam --

-- into the hanging bell with a CLANG Zorro leaps to the

bellpull rope slides down to the tabletop More Dragoons appear
from all sides --

Zorro fights them the table his circle His style is fluid more
flamboyant than Diegos He dodges spins meeting all attacks

INT ESTATE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
Love helps Montero to his feet

MONTERO
Zorro -- its Zorro

LOVE
He has the map --

MONTERO
You must stop him Kill him

Elena comes into the hallway in her nightgown hair
sleep-tousled
ELENA
Father Whats happening

MONTERO
Lock yourself in your room Now

He and Love hurry down the stairs Elena does not return to her
room She looks out the window sees --

EXT ESTATE - COURTYARD - NIGHT

Zorro is in danger of being overwhelmed as more Dragoons keep
coming Several take aim with rifles --

Zorro leaps for the bell pull -- lifts himself up into the bell
as a VOLLEY of SHOTS ricochet off RINGING it loudly --

Zorro drops down A little wobbly he swings on the bell pull
rope out over a soldiers head kicking him His boots hit the
wall leaving bootprints on the map-mural He back-flips to the
ground dashes out around the side of the house

INT STABLES - NIGHT

Zorro dashes inside Horses whinny nervously He slouches against
the wall --

A soldier comes out of a stall pistol pointed at Zorro

SOLDIER
Dont move

Zorro isnt happy to see him He looks to heaven --
-- then BANGS his fist against the stall The nervous horse
KICKS the soldier across the stable knocking him out

The FRONT DOORS close Zorro whirls --

Elena a robe wrapped around her is there They look at each
other
ZORRO
Good evening Sefiorita

ELENA
I saw you come in here

ZORRO
You should be careful There are
dangerous men about

ELENA
You lied to me You pretended to
be a priest

ZORRO
You lied to Captain Love You
pretended I was a priest

She scowls Moves toward the soldier

ELENA
Youve stolen something of my
fathers I cant let you leave

Zorro laughs He moves toward her toward the doors --

Elena draws the soldiers sword levels it at Zorro
ZORRO
Oh please

He continues toward the door --

She ATTACKS -- practiced deadly Surprised Zorro evades must
draw his sword to defend himself He leaps away from her
Considers

ZORRO
I dont have time to give you a
fencing lesson

ELENA
Youre the one who needs to learn
a few things

She engages him blades dancing --
-- a SLASH cuts his shirt He fingers the cut Then he salutes
her -- and attacks seriously

Lightning parry-ripostes --
Her robe is slowing her down She slips it off quickly

Zorro slices her nightgown exposing the smooth curve of her left
hip
ZORRO
You should have parried primero
instead of séptimo

She sneers and moves in again This time he cuts to her right
shoulder The strap of the nightgown falls away we see bare
shoulder the swell of her breast

ZORRO
And your tercera parry is too low
Youre not catching the strong of
the blade

Elenas incensed The duel renews She grabs up her robe She
uses like a cape as they fight parrying thrusts snapping it
across his face to divert him

A quick series and the sleeve of Zorros shirt drops away
exposing well-muscled arm shoulder and chest

Another exchange and Zorro finds himself backed against a stack
of hay bales Elena catches his blade in her robe -- twists it

disarming him sending his sword across the room

Theyre both stunned at this development Then Elena grins --
Zorro backrolls onto the hay bales (losing his hat) --
-- then leaps over her --
-- she slashes at him --

He lands Dismayed he examines a gash in his pants along the
inseam about three inches below the crotch

ELENA
You should have parried séptimo

He glares at her Grabs up his sword

She lunges at him He parries swipes at her head --
She ducks --

He steps on her hair She cant straighten up She glares up at
him through her hair

Elena slashes at his legs He leaps over her blade --

She snaps her head up her hair free --

-- he lands and she spins leg out taking his feet out from
under him He goes down flat on his back She attacks --

Zorro parries her attack using his spurs and boots Sparks fly
He catches the blade between crossed spurs rolls wrenches the
sword from her

She grabs up his sword faces him Both are breathing hard
sweating their clothes in a state of dishabille He weighs her
sword in his hand -- its lighter He smiles re-engages --

Zorro envelopes her blade (actually his sword) and snaps it into
the ceiling -- where it sticks

He puts her on point She never takes her eyes off him as he
moves toward her backing her toward the hay bales

She leans back -- her face is illumined by a shaft of moonlight
through a high window

ZORRO
I wondered what you would look
like bathed in moonlight
Beautiful

ELENA
(a husky whisper)
Ill scream

ZORRO
No doubt
He kisses her She does not resist Their lips part He stares
into her eyes Leans in again Shes ready for another kiss --

-- he retrieves his hat Puts it on touches the brim
ZORRO
As I said -- Good evening
Sefiorita
He tosses her sword so it sticks in the ceiling grabs his own

leaps to a ladder then to the loft and out

Elena watches him go breathing hard perhaps a bit disappointed
The doors burst open Montero follows several soldiers
MONTERO

Elena What are you doing out
here Was Zorro here

ELENA
Yes I fought him -- then he
left
(suddenly incensed)
He left

Montero rushes to a window Elena pulls her sword from the
ceiling (she must jump several times to reach it) joins him

MONTERO
Could you tell who he was Was he
an old man

ELENA
Oh no he was young Very
vigorous
She thinks about that -- then slashes the air angrily with her

sword Montero looks at her puzzled

MONTERO
You know how to fence

Elena stops looking angry starts looking guilty
EXT ESTATE - NIGHT

Zorro reaches the high exterior wall Spots a ladder leaning
against it makes for it soldiers after him

He clambers up A soldier stabs at him Zorro twists the ladder

over parrying the blade with the side rail Hanging from a step
he kicks a second soldier coming at him The first soldier stabs
again Zorro flips the ladder parrying again Kicks the man in
the face climbs up to the wall

NEAR THE STABLES Love grabs a LIEUTENANT as he rushes by

LOVE
Take a company on horseback Ford
the river block the bridge in
case he escapes --

LIEUTENANT
Yes sir

AT THE FRONT GATE Zorro battles a guard Their swords cross
lock -- Zorro picks the man up hangs him on the post of the
gate kicks him He swings away --

And Zorro turns parries a thrust from another guard Behind him
the gate swings back toward Zorro as he fights The hanging
soldier readies his sword stabs at Zorro --

-- who dodges just in time the hanging Soldier runs through the
soldier Zorro was fighting

Zorro turns One Rifleman is left standing his ground
desperately re-loading Zorro strides toward him The Rifleman
moves quickly powder wadding tamp ball tamp He raises his
rifle to shoot --

Zorro is right there He puts his sword into the barrel The
Soldier pulls the trigger -- the rifle BACKFIRES knocks him
flat Guards call out -- hes been spotted Zorro spins races
through the gates

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Alejandro rushes past trees Dives into the cover of a bush
Quiets his breathing SOUNDS of pursuit all around

LOVE (0S)
I want his head Shoot to kill

From behind Alejandro comes a RUSTLE He spins Staring straight
into his eyes is --

A FOX

Alejandro stares back The fox crouches as soldiers move past
It too is hiding SOUNDS of the soldiers FADE The fox stares
at Alejandro It is a strange silent defining moment a moment
of destiny for Alejandro
And then as suddenly as it appeared the fox leaps away
Alejandro turns from it his eyes thoughtful serene

EXT ESTATE - DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

In the distance SHOUTS from soldiers sounds of MANY HOOFBEATS
approaching Zorro steps onto the road WHISTLES for Tornado who
appears out of the woods Relieved Zorro moves toward him

ZORRO
No time to waste lets go --

At the word go Tornado takes off -- but Zorros not yet astride
him He grabs for the riata hanging from the saddle is dragged a
few yards The riata pulls free and Zorro tumbles into the
undergrowth

CORPORAL LOPEZ (0S)

I hear him Hurry -- hes getting
away

ANGLE - ZORRO on the ground as a troop on horses -- led by the
hapless Corporal Lopez -- THUNDER toward him chasing Tornado

As they race past Zorro casts his riata at a branch overhead
Runs swings out --

-- onto the last horse of the troop knocking the soldier off
EXT WOODS - MOVING WITH HORSES - NIGHT

as Zorro leaps to the next horse knocks its rider off Leaps
again knocks that rider off too One at a time he takes them
out working his way to the front

In the lead Lopez rides hard along the embankment of a raging
river He finally catches sight of Tornado -- and sees he is

riderless

CORPORAL LOPEZ
Where is he

He twists looks back over his right shoulder cries out --

His company is gone Following him is a THUNDERING HERD of
RIDERLESS HORSES an eerie sight

Lopez looks over his left shoulder --

Theres Zorro pacing him grinning at him He punches Lopez in
the face knocking him off his horse -- but Lopez catches himself
on his horses neck --

Ahead is a fallen tree coming up fast Zorro sees it --

He steps off his horse onto the back of Lopezs horse across to
Tornado into the saddle and spurs the black stallion Tornado

LEAPS over the fallen tree

Lopez still hanging from his horses neck looks over his
shoulder sees the tree approaching His horse leaps --

THUD and Lopez is gone
EXT BRIDGE - NIGHT

Ahead is a high bridge Tornado thunders across pulls up --
On the far side are seven Dragoons on horseback sent by Love
to cut Zorro off

Tornado wheels --
Behind them are four more Dragoons Zorro draws his sword

ZORRO
(to Tornado)
Well which is it going to be
Seven on that side four on the
other

Tornado wheels toward the seven
ZORRO
Sure Whats a few extra
soldiers more or less --

Tornado wheels back toward the four

ZORRO
Make up your mind

Tornado moves skittishly his ears back his eyes wild He does
not like this situation And then he lunges forward --

ZORRO
Hey Whoa WHOA

Tornado LEAPS from the bridge They plummet spectacularly down
SPLASHING into the churning river below

The soldiers look down with awe and respect

LIEUTENANT
That is the bravest man I have
ever seen
Murmurs of agreement --

EXT RIVER - NIGHT

Coughing Zorro screams at Tornado as they flail in the rushing

water
ZORRO
Stupid stupid horse Youre
crazy Dont ever do that

Tornado climbs up out of the rushing water Shakes himself off

Zorro pulls himself up onto a rock

ZORRO
I cant believe you did that

Tornado snorts at him as if to say ‘it worked didnt it
Cursing Zorro crawls onto shore

INT SECRET CAVE - NIGHT

The map is rolled open on the dais Alejandro and Diego stand
the cave floor Alejandro traces a river with his finger

ALEJANDRO
This is the canyon here There
were at least ten guards -- but we

can handle them

He heads across the dais for the exit Diego doesnt move

ALEJANDRO (CONTD)
Once the prisoners are free
they1l join the fight --
(he looks back)
What are you waiting for We have
to get moving

DIEGO
No

Alejandro is puzzled Diego doesnt meet his eyes

DIEGO (CONTD)
Montero is deceiving Santa Anna
To save his dream -- his precious
Republic of California -- he will
do whatever I want
(he looks up)
The mine must remain a secret

on
Alejandro stares at Diego aghast

ALEJANDRO
But the prisoners will die

Diego slams his hand on the dais

DIEGO
If the news of the mine gets out
Ill have no leverage over
Montero

He rolls up the map steps up and past Alejandro

DIEGO (CONTD)
Our bargain is complete Youve
discovered the truth Youre free
to take your revenge on Love

Alejandro cuts in front of Diego blocking his path
to the two men they enact a duel on the circle

ALEJANDRO
You told me that the circle would
expand my world would get
larger It has
(beat)

There is more at stake here than
just revenge

DIEGO
Would your brother agree with that

That cuts Alejandro -- but he knows the truth

ALEJANDRO
I am no longer certain killing
Love is the best way to honor

Joaquin

(accusing)
You said this was about saving
California -- the people of

California They believe Zorro is
their protector --

Diego laughs a sharp bitter laugh

DIEGO
I tried that Protecting people
I couldnt even protect my family
My whole life was destroyed My

Unbeknownst

Hearing it

wife was killed And my daughter --
(an effort to say it)
My daughter was stolen from me

it suddenly becomes clear to Alejandro

ALEJANDRO
Elena Elena is your daughter

DIEGO

Yes And with this --

(the map)
I will force Montero to tell her
the truth She will be lost to
him -- just as she was lost to me
Thats what I dream about Thats
the only circle I give a damn
about

The two men stare at each other Finally

ALEJANDRO
You think Montero will give up his
daughter for the sake of his
dream

DIEGO
Yes I know him I know him as
well as I know --
(cuts himself off)

ALEJANDRO
Yourself
(beat)
I ride to the mine

Diego grabs Alejandro by the collar

DIEGO
Santa Anna will be here ina
few hours When he finds out the
truth there will be a blood bath
Elena could be killed

ALEJANDRO

Then that gives you something to
do Save her

(quoting)
No innocent will die as long as
Zorro is alive to rescue them

(lets it sink in)
Too bad youre dead
He shoves Diego away The old man sprawls to the ground

DIEGO
Youre a fool Do you think
thats all this has been about
To make you a hero The protector
of the people

Alejandro heads for the exit
DIEGO (CONTD)
(vehemently)
You are mine I forged you as my
weapon

Alejandro turns holds Diegos gaze

ALEJANDRO
No You taught me to be Zorro

He leaves Diego is alone in the middle of the dais in the
center of the circle Lost Searching for his course

EXT DRY RIVERBED - MORNING

Love oversees several GUARDS as they force SLAVES into a small
gated tunnel on the canyon floor

There isnt much room the slaves are packed tight with more to
come

GUARD
Theyre not going to be very
comfortable all of them crammed
in like that

LOVE
Dont worry It wont be for long

Thats when the Guard notices EXPLOSIVES are being laid at the
tunnel entrance and on the slope above The implication is clear
- the slaves will be buried alive

Love strides to the ore lift nimbly leaps on t as it rises --

EXT MOUNTAINS - CANYON - GOLD STRIKE - MORNING

A load of gold ore is moved from the platform hoist onto a
wagon Love sits astride his horse

SOLDIER
Thats it The final load

LOVE
Ill escort it to Montero personally

We gradually become aware of another person in the scene Zorro
He sits astride Tornado horse and rider completely motionless
in the shadow of a boulder Watching

CLOSE ON Zorros sword hand He grips his sword tightly

LOVE
As soon as the prisoners are
confined explode the charges
Dont delay

SOLDIER
Yes sir

CLOSE ON Zorros eyes behind the mask

ZORRO
(to himself)
The cost is too high

He relaxes his grip on the sword The wagon moves forward Love
gallops away never knowing the danger he was in

Zorro dismounts silently Gestures for Tornado to stay put As
the soldiers turn away Zorro hops nimbly onto the lowering
platform as it drops out of sight

EXT DRY RIVERBED - MORNING

Fray Felipe clings to a post refusing to move into the tunnel
He is whipped by a SADISTIC SOLDIER

FELIPE
(in Latin)
- forgive us our trespasses as
we forgive those who trespass
against us

SADISTIC SOLDIER
Oh shut up Gods not going to
answer your prayers

Of course thats when Zorro appears behind him a dark angel
Felipes eyes widen

SADISTIC SOLIDER (CONTD)
He sure never answered mine
The soldier raises his whip turns Zorro gives him a smile
ZORRO
Next time you can ask Him in
person

The soldier slashes the whip at Zorro who runs him through

Zorro offers his hand to the priest helps him up

FELIPE
You really are Zorro arent
you

ZORRO
Help the others Get them out of
here

Felipe nods Zorro pulls open the gate to the tunnel Slaves
spill out climbing up the scaffolding and ladders to freedom
One of the soldiers setting explosives spots them

SOLDIER
Its Zorro Get him

Soldiers scramble toward Zorro The fuse line spool to the powder
kegs is dropped

Zorro moves with grace and economy taking on two then three
then four soldiers at once

He kills two of them -- but a GRINNING SOLDIER pins his blade
disarms him Zorro backs away from him onto the ore lift
platform The Grinning Soldier pursues him onto the lift backed
by a SECOND SOLDIER --

Suddenly Zorro shoves the ore car off the lift with his leg
rolling off himself in the opposite direction

The Soldiers grin fades -- as the platform shoots up into the
air taking the Soldier with it Zorro scoops up his blade
parries a thrust from the Second Soldier Zorro shoves him back

-- directly beneath the counterweight of the ore lift as it
plummets down the soldier is crushed Zorro turns away as behind
him with a scream and a THUD the Grinning Soldier drops down to
the ground fallen from above

Zorro climbs the scaffolding leaps off knocking a soldier down
Punches him --
But another soldier sneaks toward Zorro coming at him from
behind bayonet raised --

The little GIRL sees him She breaks away from the others
Bravely climbs a ladder onto a platform Kicks the ladder over
The ladder falls --

-- and collars the attacking Soldier around the neck Zorro grabs
the ladder and helps the Soldier along -- into another Soldier
They run each other through

Zorro looks up at the Girl who meets his gaze bravely He takes
off his MEDALLION slips it over her head

ZORRO
Thank you Senorita

GIRL
Are we going to die

ZORRO
No No one is going to die

Zorro hands her down to others who climb out of the canyon He
spins back to the fight guarding the escape rout as the last of
the slaves climb to safety

A Soldier glances at a huge smelting hopper filled with hot
embers gets an idea He gestures to another Soldier

They grab the edge of the hopper slowly TILT IT OVER It falls
and glowing EMBERS wash toward Zorro --

Zorro sees the hot embers coming dives out of the way avoiding
a wild swipe at his head by another Soldier Flailing the
Soldier loses his balance falls backwards into the burning
embers SCREAMING

A small rivulet of embers makes its way to the fallen fuse roll
The FUSE FLARES -- then IGNITES

Soldiers flee Zorro climbs the scaffolding ore-life structure
racing to safety --

A MASSIVE EXPLOSION A LANDSLIDE the entrance to the tunnel is
buried The mining scaffolding crumbles a good half of it
slamming to the ground

Zorro clings to a rope hanging in mid-air He looks over 111
The only person still on the scaffolding is Fray Felipe -- anda

FINAL SOLDIER battling him Felipe wards off sword thrusts with
a piece of wood
Zorro pushes off swings across to a platform near Felipe The
Final Soldier sees Zorro turns away from Felipe

ZORRO
(to Felipe)

Get to safety Go
Zorro guards the way as Felipe climbs to safety
Zorro and the last soldier duel FLAMES licking at the
scaffolding below parts of it crumbling beneath them as they
fight Zorro dispatches him quickly he plummets to his death
EXT MOUNTAINS - CANYON - GOLD STRIKE - MORNING
Felipe reaches a high ledge helped up by other freed slaves He
looks down into the canyon at the duel below crosses himself
says a silent prayer --
EXT DRY RIVERBED - MORNING
The mining scaffolding is consumed by blazing flames Zorro races
along a platform leaps into space just as the entire structure
crashes to the ground
Zorro clings to the side of the canyon beneath an overhang He
digs his knife into the dirt wall for better purchase but its
clear he cant hang on long
EXT MOUNTAINS - CANYON - GOLD STRIKE - MORNING

The Girl raises an arm points

GIRL
Look

EXT MOUNTAINS - CANYON - GOLD STRIKE - MORNING

Tornado appears on the ledge above Zorro Throws his head
forward his reins drop down within Zorros reach Zorro grabs
them -- Tornado backs away pulling Zorro to safety

EXT MOUNTAINS - LEDGE - MORNING

A CHEER rings out from the onlookers Felipe shakes his head in

disbelief grinning like a fool

FELIPE

She said he was my father

The two men stare at her

Montero finally finds his voice

MONTERO

Ridiculous He

must have paid her

to tell you lies

(to Diego

)

Is that why you came here For

revenge

Diego shakes his head slowly

DIEGO

Theres a proverb When you seek
revenge dig two graves One for
your enemy One for yourself

MONTERO

If thats so

- you did twice as

much work as you had to
(to the soldiers)

Lock him up in

the stables Keep

him under guard And be careful

The soldiers grab Diego roughly Haul him from the courtyard

DIEGO

The longboat hits the beach Santa Annas horse leaps to shore
Other boats are landing they are chockfull of Santa Annas honor
guard in bright crimson uniforms

out in pain The soldiers bunch up behind him

POX

how come you got captured

DIEGO
I needed a sword

Diego grabs the hilt of Poxs sword -- and swings the scabbard up
between the Privates legs doubling him over
Pox yanks away from Diego Moves to draw his sword --

Diego simply CATCHES POXS ELBOW and SHOVES IT BACK
re-sheathing the sword Pox tries to draw again and Diego
repeats the trick Smiles

Pox lets go of his sword and just swings a roundhouse at Diego
Diego ducks the punch --

-- and draws Poxs sword Pox finds the point at his throat

DIEGO
This one will do

He steps forward quickly clocks Pox with the pommel He yanks
the second soldier to his feet Sword at his back he shoves the
soldier toward the house

INTEXT ESTATE - COURTYARD - MORNING
Montero checks to make sure the map is still in the pouch

ELENA
Why would he want revenge on you

MONTERO
Because he hates me Because
because Esperanza chose me over
him Hes never forgotten it

My mother lived here in
California You told me --

Montero spins on her She steps back startled
MONTERO
Elena -- enough We will finish
this discussion later
He takes her elbow escorts her toward the stairs

business is concluded

The Private appears in the archway

MONTERO
What are you doing here
The private walks stiffly to the table near the pouch

MONTERO
I ordered you to the stables

Diego hidden behind the Private slams the Privates head down
on the table The Private slumps to the floor

DIEGO
He didnt make it

He takes the pouch heads for the door Montero cuts him off

MONTERO
Youre not going anywhere

DIEGO
Im going to deliver this to Santa
Anna and see if I can prevent the
consequences of your actions
Once he sees the mine for himself

MONTERO

(he draws his sword)
No
Diego considers -- then slips the pouch into his belt

DIEGO
This time Im armed

MONTERO
No matter

He attacks They engage begin to feel each other out Despite
their ages and despite Diegos bad leg their blades are

lightning quick

The duel moves toward Elena She scrambles toward the Private
draws his sword -- and then his pistol as well

Montero slips Diego has an opening He advances SLASHES --
Another sword -- not Monteros -- STOPS Diegos blade inches from
Monteros throat Diego whirls responds to the new threat A
quick exchange of thrusts and parries --

Diego freezes He is fighting ELENA Diego is incredulous

ELENA
Stop Both of you --
And then Montero attacks Diego jumps aside barely avoiding
deadly thrust Montero slashes at him then suddenly stops

Smiles looking over Diegos shoulder

Captain Love strides into the courtyard Without hesitation
draws his pistol aims at Diego --

ELENA
No

Elena leaps in front of Diego --
-- Diego and Montero see whats coming --
-- Love pulls the trigger --

The pistol MISFIRES Montero and Diego realize how near a thing

it was -- a near-repeat of Esperanzas death twenty years
earlier Love just shrugs

LOVE

Hangfire Lucky

Love drops the pistol draws his sword -- and attacks Diego

Diego must now defend himself against both men He moves to the

stairs keeping one opponent in front of the other

LOVE

Their duel resumes Zorro SLASHES Loves cheek Another SLASH
angling off the first And then a third making a Z Love
ignores the blood And then ZORRO makes a FOURTH CUT

On it is the BLOOD IMPRINT of an M Love looks up at Zorro
Alejandro strips off his mask

ALEJANDRO

Love attacks He locks Alejandros blade with his corps a corps
He slashes his gauntlet across Alejandros eyes Alejandro
staggers fighting blind Love slashes his leg --

Alejandro goes down to one knee Love steps on his blade
Alejandro looks up Love smiles prepares the killing blow --

Alejandro slams his fist down on Loves foot With a yelp Love
takes his weight off the foot -- and Alejandro yanks his other
leg out from under him Love tumbles down the stairs

Diego disarms Montero He holds Montero at swords point

Diegos arm is tense trembling

ELENA
Please -- dont

Diego hesitates Elena steps close to Montero Montero grabs her
around the neck grabs her pistol puts it to her head Elena
gasps in shock Diego steps forward --

MONTERO
Drop your sword

No hesitation -- Diego does it His sword clatters to the floor
Elena stares at him Montero sneers

MONTERO
You fool -- I wouldnt have hurt
her
Diego looks from him to Elena His eyes say it all -- a fathers

love for his daughter

DIEGO
I couldnt take that chance

Elenas eyes widen She knows in her heart who her true father
is Montero turns the pistol toward Diego cocks it --

ELENA
No

She shoves Monteros arm as he FIRES --
-- the bullet HITS Diego in the arm spins him to the floor

Montero twists Elena around glares into her eyes -- shoves her
down He strides toward Diego picks up his fallen sword

MONTERO
Youll die by the sword after all

Alejandros eyes clear He sees
Montero -- aiming the swords point at Diegos heart --

Alejandro flashes across the room his sword SLASHING down He
cuts deep into Monteros arm Monteros sword flies away
Alejandro shoves him back against the gallery railing

DIEGO
(a warning shout)
Alejandro --

Love runs at Alejandro He spins parries Loves sword --

-- Loves momentum drives the thrust into Montero Monteros eyes
go wide Love CRASHES into Alejandro who SLAMS into Montero --

Both Alejandro and Montero break through the gallery rail
Monteros body falls THUDS onto the table below

Elena gasps Stares down in horror --
Montero lies in the center of the table Alone

Alejandro hangs from the edge of the gallery He hauls himself
up so hes lying half-on half-off the floor Love steps on his
back driving out his breath

Love raises his sword above his head targets Alejandros neck --
From behind him comes a SCREAM -- ELENAS SCREAM
Love turns --

Elena swings a saber at him two-handed The blades edge chops
hard across Loves neck axing in edge first It sticks imbedded
in his throat He falls backwards --
-- and down face-down toward the floor between TWO CHAIRS the
sword still wedged into his throat --

The sword hilt impacts on the arm of one chair
The tip of the blade imbeds on the arm of the other

Loves BODY hits the floor Followed by his HEAD Severed in the
fall eyes staring into the hereafter

The SWORD remains bridged between the two chairs

N THE GALLERY -- Elena flinches at the sight But she still
reaches down to help Alejandro up He gathers her in his arms

DIEGO
In honor of our past association
long ago I would like to

request leniency for this pueblo

It would go hard on the people if

you mete out this harsh justice

Santa Annas eyes flare His voice is grim

SANTA ANNA
I understand your concern for the
people But what of these men
They tried to take what is mine
Why should I be lenient

Diego limps to the wagon just outside the archway

DIEGO
Because you can afford to be
Because it is yours your
