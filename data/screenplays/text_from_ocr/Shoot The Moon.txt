Mr Dunlap your insistence on

This Christmas the children will

As for you Mrs Dunlap to deny
the father the right to take the
children to school three times a
week seems an unnecessary hardship
If he so wishes and he is the only
father they have right now why
shouldnt he enjoy that privilege
Do you understand Mrs Dunlap
