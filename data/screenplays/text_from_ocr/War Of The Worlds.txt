NARRATOR

No one would have believed in the early
years of the21st century that our world
was being watched by intelligences greater
than our own That as men busied themselves
about their various concerns they observed
and studied Like the way a man with

a microscope might scrutinize the creatures
that swarm and multiply in a drop of

water With infinite complacency men

went to and fro about the globe confident
of our empire over this world Yet

across the gulf of space intellects

vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded
our plant with envious eyes And slowly
and surely drew their plans against

us

INT HARLANDS HOUSE - BASEMENT - DUSK - CONTINUOUS

Harland walks up to the lantern hanging on the wall and
at Ray and Rachel His face half lit looks medieval

clothes he wears

Harland grabs the lantern and carries it over to where

Rachel are huddled shivering in their damp clothes

HARLAND

(to Rachel) You all right

Rachel does not respond most likely due to shock

HARLAND

(to Ray) And what about you

Ray looks up at him and looks at the lantern He is

muttering Robbie very quietly

Harland moves a wheel barrel as rats are seen scurrying
on the floor The army platoon has gone far enough over

that gunfire can no longer be seen or heard

RAY

(while Harland moves the wheel barrel)
(to Rachel) There you go Is that

Harland is watching them through fallen out boards in
the wall
RACHEL
(about ready to cry) What do you think

Harland sits down on the stairs to listen to their
conversation

He begins sharpening a shovel with a file

RAY

her) And shes in grandmas kitchen

RACHEL

Sing me Hushabye Mountain

Rachel turns over (her back to Ray) because she
realizes that

it is a lost hope to get a song out of him Ray thinks
fora

moment and remembers an old nursery rhyme he was
taught

RAY

(begins to sing) Im not bragging baby
So dont put me down Because Ive got

forehead Harland
taps two glasses together and says

He pauses and begins chuckling at his own joke

HARLAND

Hah Dead set on Living

Harland walks back over to the place where the
conversation first
started

RAY

Thank you for taking us in

Ray lies down next to Rachel as Harland finishes
HARLAND

Were not going to be exterminated

The ground starts shaking from robots walking around

outside
Ray gets back up just as BOOM A small piece of the

corner of
the basement collapses from all the vibration

HARLAND
(with shotgun at side) Its okay Come
on I wanna show you something

They both are waling towards a window

HARLAND

Were gonna fight them Ray They gotta
have a weakness Come on take a look

Ray and Harland see two robots spraying vine like

strands out
of a hole on the bottom of the ship onto the ground

HARLAND

Somehow they killed a few of these things
in Osaka Thats what I heard You telling
me the Japanese can figure it out but

we cant

Ray goes over to Rachel and picks her up to take her

somewhere
else

HARLAND

We can do it We can get em We can
figure it out

Ray puts the now wide awake Rachel in a chair

RAY
Stay right there
Ray opens up a window guard to see two robots skimming

the ground
almost as if they are tilling up the soil He now

understands
that robots do this on a regular basis
RAY
I have a daughter Why did you bring
us here
HARLAND
To fight em together Ray
Now well be the ones coming up from
underground When the time is right

staying
with an insane man
HARLAND
Were right under their feet Ray Right

INT HARLANDS HOUSE - BASEMENT - NEAR DUSK
Ray looks at the mysterious red plant that is growing
wildly

He feels it and them snaps a piece of it off of a pipe
He examines
are beaming

of a wall

over

board

with Rachel

that to

him They

it closely as he walks over to the window where lights
in and out as the robots work He takes another piece

and studies that one

Ray hears a hovering craft over his head A light flows
the roof boards that streams down to the other end of a

hall in the basement Harland is sitting on the stairs

HARLAND
You miss your mommy I had a little
girl nearly your age You know if anything
happens to your daddy Ill take care
of you

Ray is very angry that Harland is saying things like

his daughter

Rachel

Rachel runs towards him and he points to stand beside

both stare at Harland on the stairs in dismay

RAY

(distinctly angry but not yelling)

You dont have anything to say to her
do you understand If you want to talk
to somebody or ask somebody a question
you ask me

HARLAND

(also angry at Ray) What exactly is
your plan Ray I know what Im gonna
do How about you You gonna sit here
wait for them to come get you Is that
your plan

Harland walks around to different parts of the basement
doing
miscellaneous things

HARLAND

Maybe you want to get caught Couple
of days hiding in a basement too much
for you I bet Youll probably turn
yourself right in

The robots outside stop moving All the rumbling stops

RAY

Listen It stopped

HARLAND

(paying no attention) Maybe youll be

okay Maybe youll get lucky and theyll
train you as their pet You know train

you feed you teach you how to do tricks

RAY

(yells) WILL YOU SHUT UP AND LISTEN

Pieces of wood fall from the hole as a robot camera
comes floating

down into the hole Ray hides behind the stairs The
camera eye

opens and lights turn on for it

Rachel is hiding as well The camera looks around the
couch

Ray moves as to not be seen by it moving around the
couch It
sees a rat and quickly follows it for a few seconds

Ray and

Harland exchange looks as Ray runs toward Rachel to
hide with

her

The robot continues checking out the basement Harland
grabs

an axe to cut off the camera from its limb Ray shakes
his head

no to get him to stop Ray silently does expressions to
convince

him not to

Harland goes towards ray so they can hide together
Harland almost

makes it before he thuds against a cabinet full of
glass containers

which clang together The robot hears this and turns
around toward

the noise They run to a different spot

Robot gets closer

Ray puts a mirror in front of the doorway to trick the
robot

into seeing another robot The camera looks over the
mirror and

sees nothing

It turns around just as Rachels boot slides making
a noise

The robot views into the boot that is hanging out It
looks behind

the mirror to find just a boot sitting there Ray
Rachel and

Harland are in the middle of the basement A sight of
relief

comes as the robot camera exits out of the hole

Now the actual aliens come into the basement Harland
turns the

lantern out and runs to hide The aliens look around
the basement

They look at smell and touch various different things
throughout
different parts

aliens

both

around

the gun
forces

his grasp

from a box

him just

The aliens

and says

the basement Ray Rachel and Harland scurry to

of the basement

Harland loads his gun and aims it to fire at one of the

but the gun is pulled back by Ray

RAY

(dead silent) Give me that

Ray and Harland are in a silent fight for the gun They

have their hands on it The aliens continue looking

Ray and Harland are both sweating bullets fighting for
Still silently Harland pins Ray against the wall and

him down to the ground to try and break the gun free of

The aliens are seen taking and smelling a photograph

Ray lets go of the gun and Harland jerks it away from
as the vibration like noise is heard from the robot

scurry out through the open hole

Harland comes down to Ray now sitting on the floor

HARLAND

You and I I dont think we are on
the same page
INT HARLANDS HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY

The vines ray looked at are growing at a phenomenal
rate along

the concrete slab under the window Robots are spraying
a red

mist out of the back of their ships Ray holds his hand
in the

mist that is entering the window After a moment

Ray retracts
his hand and turns it over to reveal what appears to be

blood
HARLAND
RAY RAY Rayttt Raylill
RAY
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN QUIET
Harland turns around and his whole face is covered in
spots of

blood

They both turn back around then Harland runs Ray

watches a man
being set down fighting to be let go A needle like

object comes
down and stabs the man It then pumps the blood out of

him Ray
has a horrified look on his face

HARLAND
(repeats for about 2 minutes) Not My

Blood

Ray realizes they will have the same fate if he keeps
yelling
Then the robots stop because they hear him Ray runs
to Harland
who is digging some sort of hole

RAY

Stop it Stop it You gotta stop it
You gotta be quiet or theyll hear you

HARLAND

(with an insane expression and tone)
They drink us

RAY

Please theyll hear you

HARLAND

Then they spray us like a fertilizer

RAY

You gotta be quiet

HARLAND

Drink US and

RAY

Theyre gonna come back down here

Harland has mentally lost it now

HARLAND

Then they spit us out all over their
goddamn red weeds
RAY

(no longer whispering) Do you understand
what Im gonna have to do I cant let
my daughter die because of you

Harland pays no attention to him
HARLAND
This tunnel will get us to the city

Ray grabs him by the arm just as he hits ray in the

forehead
with a shovel Ray releases his grip and lies on a dirt
pile
next to Harland
HARLAND
Were the resistance Ray They cant
occupy this country Occupations always
fail Historys taught us that a thousand
times This is our land
Ray runs up the stairs of the room to Rachel standing
calmly
in the middle of the basement
HARLAND
(continues) We eat it we breathe
it only we can live on it They cant
survive here Ray They werent built
for it
Ray hugs Rachel because he knows what he has to do
Harland goes on saying odd things as Ray gets Rachel
prepared

for what he has to do

Ray puts a black cloth over Rachels eyes which makes
her breathing

go erratic

Harland stops and sees Ray standing in the doorway

of boats that are waiting

Rachel releases her hands and takes off the blindfold

sitting on the stairs

Rachel sits in his lap and puts his arms around her

sit there in silence

INT HARLANDS HOUSE - BASEMENT - DUSK

Ray and Rachel are sleeping on the couch As we view
Rays face we find that Rachel is wide awake for some

She sits up and

RACHEL

(screams) AHHHH

A robot camera is 1 away from her face Rachel runs to
still screaming as ray hits the camera with his hands

hits the ceiling and shakes its self off of debris

Ray begins blasting the axe he had in hand into the

camera attachment

over and

line Rachel screams as he hits the line Over and
over Rachel runs up the basement stairs Ray continues
hitting

it and it finally pulls away The camera still
attached by a

hair hits some wood planks and is pulled out of the
hole

Rachel

No response for a few seconds then Rachel lets off a
gut wrenching
scream

RAY
RACHEL (to himself) Oh my god

He runs up the stairs to search for her in the house

grabs the car and flips it causing it to roll about 3

RAY

(screams) AHH

Now in the car lying upside down he hears Rachel

looks and Rachel is standing at the top of a hill

The robot centers above her and begins to grab her with

Ray runs towards her to try and do what he can to stop
RACHEL

(screams) AHHHHH

NO NO NO

The robot blasts through a building Ray is right

behind the
foot He runs into an army vehicle and finds a belt

full of grenades
He takes on off removes the pin and throws it at the

robot

HEY

It hits the robots shields and the robot turns right

around
It eyeballs Ray for a moment and picks him up by a
grabbing claw

RAY

(screams in pain) AHHH

He is thrown into a cage with about 30 other people in
it as
well The gate closes on the top as he is thrown in

The camera
shows he is in one of two cages People scream and cry

in confusion
Ray spots Rachel sitting on the side of the grate

RACHEL
He goes towards her just as the door opens it makes a

sound

and a grabbing claw comes out of a hole on the robot
Ray falls

down (luckily) it grabs another person and sucks him
into the

ship The same happens in the other cage

RAY

(reaching Rachel) Rachel (no response)
Rachel

She seems to be frozen

Rachel

RACHEL

Dad

Ray goes to speak just as BOOM The grate shifts
tossing all

the people around and the door opens to take another
person up

Ray ducks down with Rachel but this is noticed by the
grabbing

claw He is swept up by it Rachel holds on to his neck
to go

with him But then Ray sees his belt of grenades He
prigs Rachels

hands off of him and grabs the grenades A soldier sees

this
and latches onto Rays arm
SOLDIER 2
Pull me Pull me
People all start latching on to the soldier and begin
heaving

him and Ray down They loose ground until more people
join

Ray is let loose by the clamp and they all fall back

into the

cage Ray spits out two grenade pins out of his mouth
This is

seen by the soldier

SOLDIER 2
EVERYBODY DOWN

Hardly anybody gets down as the inside of the robot
explodes

We can see the robot exploding on the inside It breaks
doors

and fluid stars spilling out of it The robot releases
its cages

and they fall into a tree Splitting open People
promptly climb

out

Once the robot falls to the ground Rachel looks at Ray

ina

way that meant how did you do that

Boston City Limits - Freeway - Day

Ray walks with Rachel down the road as soldiers are
ushering

them to keep moving The crows are now eating the red
plant

which appears to be dying rapidly Ray picks up a
piece of
dead plant

RACHEL

What happened to it
Ray crumples the plant in his hand It turns to dust
and blows

away

Its dying

Watching the dust they walk along to find a robot
lying half
struck into a building

RAY

NARRATOR

From the moment the invaders arrived
breathed our air ate and drank they
were doomed They were undone destroyed
after all of mans weapons and devices
had failed by the tiniest creatures

that God and his wisdom put upon this
earth At the toll of a billion deaths
man had earned his immunity is right

to survive among this planets infinite
organisms And that right is ours against
all challenges for men do not live

nor die in vein

FADE OUT TO BLACK

THE END
