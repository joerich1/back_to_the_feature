CUT IN

FROM SOMEONE’S HD CAMERA

We’re outside at a theme park It’s Grad Nite so all the
park-goers are just-graduated high school seniors

Something is very wrong

It’s nighttime All the electrical power is out Everyone
is waiting in darkness for the power to come back on

KID 1 and KID 2 are on a balcony viewing area

KID 1
That have a light

KID 2 (0OS)
(operating the camera)
What the camera Yup it does

Kid 2 flips on the camera’s light Blinding white light hits
Kid 1 in the face he has to shield his eyes

KID 2 (0S) (CONT’D)
Sorry sorry

Kid 2 angles the camera away down at the crowd of energy-
wracked seniors on the walkway below

The camera light acting as a beacon in the darkness the
seniors cheer at and flip off the camera as Kid 2 gets a
sweeping panoramic shot of the madness

FUNNY KID BELOW
(yelling out at the camera
light)
The Second Coming of Jesus
The crowd chuckles a perfect tension breaker

CRACK-THWOOOOOOM-BOOOOOM

Kid 2 jerks the camera up at the night sky a crystal-clear
starfield

A MASSIVE DISC-SHAPED CRAFT is falling out of the sky It’s
engulfed in flames And it’s headed straight for the park-
goers

Fun’s over Undeniable panic sets in
KID 2 (0S)
Go-go-go-go-go

Kid 1 Kid 2 and everyone in sight set off running in
disparate directions

The camera’s mic is blown out by the high frequency din of
what sounds like the very world coming to an end

A blinding flash fills the frame an explosion

The camera falls out of Kid 2’s grasp the worldangle
tipping sideways

FREEZE IMAGE
The ‘Pause’ icon pops up so the tape has paused

Then the ‘Rewind’ icon pops up and suddenly the tape we’re
watching starts to rewind

We catch non-linear glimpses of strange events and unfamiliar
faces but luckily the tape rewinds fast enough to not have
to worry about context right now

The ‘Stop’ icon pops up the tape stops

Then ‘Play’ is pressed so that we’re at the

START OF TAPE

EXT TRACK and FIELD BRONSON HIGH - DAY

FROM DARREN’S HD CAMERA

CUT - to indicate time lapses within a scene

The lens cap of the camera is taken off so it takes a few
seconds for the angle to come into focus and the light levels

to automatically adjust

The camera’s currently pointed down at the field’s freshly-
cut grass

DARREN ARENDS the camera’s operator is 17 years old and
from what we can hear quite an affable young man

The Cheerleaders speak into camera emotional and sweet as
can be

to the entire school Can’t wait
to see you again

each other for emotional support Whoever this Autumn is
she’s obviously a sensitive subject

Darren is filming a HIPSTER AFRICAN-AMERICAN kid whos
holding up an Odd Future skateboard for the camera

HIPSTER AFRICAN-AMERICAN

He hops on the skateboard and tries to grind a nearby bench
but then proceeds to accidently flip forward and eat shit on
the pavement

Darren runs to help the kid the camera flailing wildly at
his side

and well be hitting up Fro-Yo City
again in no time

Her face crumples up in an expression of tearful angst as
she turns her head away in embarrassment

Darren zooms in on her Not disrespectfully but definitely
in the mode of capturing a rare moment of vulnerability

As he steps in closer for a better shot (now he’s being
disrespectful)

On Nannie who’s milling about on the other side of the

saying It looks as though they’ve agreed to sit next to
each other on the bus

They look thrilled

Then Raul shows up He sneaks up behind Nannie places his

her

A large man one of the FACULTY CHAPERONES addresses the

EXT PHANTASMA WILD WORKS THEME PARK - NIGHT
FROM DARREN’S HD CAMERA

Standing in front of PHANTASMA a haunted maze attraction
Darren has perched his camera up on a wall so that he’s
framed in the shot

He backtracks looking up at the camera until he reaches the
stone statue of a Grim Reaper character

The Grim Reaper’s skeletal hand is outstretched in a neck-
choke articulation Darren giggling to himself slides his
neck inside the statue’s grip

It looks like the Grim Reaper has a deathly hold on Darren

Darren plays it up for the camera widening his eyes for
effect and pretending to choke out his final breaths

Someone walks up behind Darren and waits to say something

MALE
Darren

Darren turns around and immediately recognizes the person

DARREN
(shocked)
Erik

This male is ERIK ANDUJAR the point of contention between
Darren and Nannie The one presumably responsible for
Autumn’s accident

Erik’s wearing a hoodie with the insignia of another local
high school

ERIK
Didn’t want to interrupt your
improv sesh-

DARREN
No it’s fine Hey man

ERIK
Didn’t expect to see you here

DARREN
About to say the same

ERIK
Uh-huh

There’s too much to say in this moment a river of emotion
behind sparse words

Yet there’s an air of comfort between the two a salvageable
familiarity living within the husk of a broken friendship

ERIK (CONTD)
Should we talk Or can we talk
Id like to catch up maybe if-

Just then a THUNDEROUS SONIC BOOM rocks the park

Darren and Erik instinctively duck down as if the sky was
falling on their heads that’s how loud the boom is

ERIK (CONTD)
-hell was that-

Everyone around them looks up at the sky where a fast-
approaching screech of sound trails above Darren runs and
hops up at the wall to retrieve his camera

CUT

Darren’s filming the night sky a vast crystal-clear
starfield

We hear the jittery excited voices of hundreds of park-goers
all conjecturing at the same time everyone scanning the
skies for the source of the boom

That distant whining screech gets closer and louder

ERIK (0S) (CONT’D)
Maybe it’s a train outta control

the sounds as they ascend higher and higher

She was just filming her dangling feet the people on the

hurriedly adjusts the angle

They just heard the sonic boom like everyone else in the

Darren films Erik’s stunned expression

ERIK
That was excessive

swinging contest with Disney World

Darren angles the camera back up at the stars trying to
capture the now-impossible-to-capture fighter jets

CUT
Another boom

This sounds farther away much farther Perhaps miles away
Yet another boom and then a crackle

The pop-pop-pop of echoey gunfire
Darren knows what this all sounds like but he is too afraid
to say it aloud It sounds like the kick-off to a violent

military skirmish

EXT DEIMO’S DROP WILD WORKS THEME PARK - SAME

FROM NANNIE’S SMARTPHONE CAMERA

Their car is finishing its last couple of meters of ascension
before completely stopping

The ride and impending drop aren’t what’s ruffling them at
the moment

Nannie’s trying to zoom in on something happening a few miles
away right on the horizon out in the real world

The low-light conditions give the shot a low-fi fuzzy
quality hard to see

The flash-bang of explosions
The flared streaks of gunfire hailing upward from below
Shapes military planes moving in on a sizable target

Nannie’s filming a ground-to-air-to-air battle

What those fighter jets and military units on the ground
are firing at is as of yet unclear

NANNIE (0S)
(sheer panic)
Is this real Can’t be real

Then snapping them back to their immediate surroundings the
ride fulfills its thrill-seeking promise and suddenly drops

The ride-goers scream bloody murder

Whether the screams are from the actual ride or from what
they’re seeing on the horizon is up to interpretation

They fall ten stories straight down reaching a maximum
negative g-force speed of fifty mph Intense

As the car rockets back up to the top for another go-around
we notice Wild Work’s electricity start to flicker brown
out

Entire power grids across the city extinguish at punctuating
intervals

The car jerks to an unexpected stop freezes near the very
top

straight for the park-goers

Darren Erik and everyone in sight set off running in

The alien disc-shaped craft continues to spiral out of
control in the sky falling down to earth blue-and-orange
plumes eating at its underside

The alien craft has been irreparably damaged by military
attack

Fighter jets are right on its tail blasting the alien craft
with percussive missile hits

The UFO is now a thousand feet up in the air and rapidly
descending about to hit ground

Nannie’s hand uncontrollably shakes as she films what she

A solid tidal wave of concrete fire detonated detritus and

alien craft’s damaged non-man-made exterior

Tiny figures on screen teenagers run for their lives Away

people that swings back and forth at extreme angles

Even though the power’s out the momentum of the swinging
ship hasn’t ceded

The ship continues to swing high from one end to another
out of control

Kids are screaming terrified it won’t ever end

Were viewing this from the on-ride perspective of Thuggish
Kid 1 and his buddy Thuggish Kid 2 the guys who gave trouble
to Darren earlier

Things start to jump onto the pirate ship

They’re human-shaped except they move like insects They’re
some sort of hybrid resultant of the transmutative gas that
came out of the downed spacecraft

Darren inadvertently kicks the camera as he leaps over it
pulling Erik by the arms sending downward jabs at the
animal

angle
We see the animal in full view
It’s not an animal It’s a human A kid 18 years old His
skin transmutated by the alien poison that shot out of the
crashed craft
He no longer is completely human

HeIt is THE CRAWLER

Its skin bubbles Its eyes rolled back to luminescent
whites

It crawls on all fours its arms and legs bent in unnatural
ways like a spider-crab

The Crawler is projectile-vomiting acidic bile at Erik
attempting to melt down Erik’s skin and bone for consumption

Erik yells bloody-murder a splash of acid melting through
his corduroy pants

Darren sends a vicious kick to The Crawler’s head

It BRAYS back at Darren pissed
Darren pulls Erik’s slashed and beaten body away from The
Crawler the human-alien hybrid menacing its way forward

unafraid

Darren has less than a second to figure out how to ward off
the monster

Just as The Crawler kowtows at its joints readying to leap
up at Darren for the kill Darren jumps out of frame

We lose sight of Darren for half a moment

The camera picks itself up operated by Darren again as the
light attached to the front of the camera flips back on

The blinding white light hits The Crawler in its hellacious
face revealing the mottled features of what was once a baby-
faced teenage boy

The Crawler hisses at the light freaked

They make it just barely holding onto the maintenance
ladder safe for now

The drop car comes back to life re-ignited by the wave of
resurgent electrical power and DROPS STRAIGHT DOWN as it’s
designed to do

If Raul and Beatriz had been on top of it just a millisecond
later they’d be tumbling fifteen stories down to their
deaths

Erik turns the camera lens on himself

His face is bloody and scratched He’s okay for now
Actually he’s barely powering past the trauma of getting
attacked

ERIK (CONTD)
(looking up at the ride)
Should we try to follow Darren up
there

Jessica shows up in frame just behind Erik

JESSICA
Nope
(re Erik’s injuries)
We don’t know what that thing was
what if you’re infected or-

ERIK
I’m not anything and that was not a
thing

JESSICA

Then what was it

ERIK
Crack-head spider-dude whatever

JESSICA
What if it comes back With more
of ‘em like a horde of freaks

ERIK
(facetious smile)
No worries we got the Army on our
side Anyways if you could ditch
the John Carpenter poppycock
that’d be a real booster

JESSICA
Who’s John the carpenter Look
youre bleeding and stuff Be
careful is all I’m saying

ERIK
Be careful How ominous of you
(beat thinking)
I say that right Oh-mih-nus

Erik’s handing the camera over to Jessica who’s reticent to
film at birthday parties let alone a moment like this She
just holds it uncomfortable not trying to capture anything

Emerging from the exits of Deimo’s Drop are Darren Nannie
and Beatriz

Beatriz is holding onto Nannie for support her knees weak
and spirit drained

Darren escorts the two of them slow and vigil

Erik crosses over to meet them happy to see they made it
Darren makes eye contact with him waves him off so the girls
have their space

The camera tilts up as Jessica fumbles with the buttons

JESSICA
-you turn this off

EXT WALKWAY WILD WORKS THEME PARK - NIGHT

The camera’s back in Darren’s possession he sets it on a
bench He fiddles with its light dimmer than it’s suppossed
to be

Erik picks up the camera again turning the lens on himself
His pallor is starting to look odd if the swaths of blood
weren’t odd enough

ERIK
(into camera)
Dude Darren you can sock me later
for this but like I said lawsuit
Gotta film everything for the
record Sorry

Erik reverse-angles the camera walks past Jessica who
stares icicles at Erik

ERIK (0S) (CONT’D)
What

JESSICA
I know we just met like a few hours
ago but

ERIK (0S)
I don’t wanna hear it

Erik moves on already annoyed with her

JESSICA

choice buddy

CUT

Erik gives a respectful distance zooms in on Nannie
consoling an emotionally wrecked Beatriz who’s on her knees
weeping

Raul her twin brother is assuredly dead
CUT
Darren stands by the two girls unsure what to do or say

We hear the rising thwock-thwock-thwock of helicopter blades
getting near

The camera scans the skies searching for the copter Noise
pollution is a hindrance in this moment

CUT

A patrolling Black Hawk is now RIGHT ABOVE THEM its
searchlight blasting them white hot

Their hair and clothes litter and tree branches tousle
wildly in the wind of the military copter’s downdraft

YOU DO NOT COMPLY YOU WILL BE SHOT

The Black Hawk veers off catching up to another group of
stragglers in the distance shouting out the exact same
orders

The angle lands on Darren who’s coming at Erik fast
fearful

ERIK (0S)
Why I got this-

DARREN
We’re going

EXT CENTRAL HUB WILD WORKS THEME PARK - NIGHT
Darren is operating the camera again

Darren Nannie Erik Jessica (still holding cowboy teddy
bear) and Beatriz are walking together heading back towards
the entrance of the park

The camera’s bouncing about willy-nilly Darren tapping
fruitlessly at its external light which won’t turn on

DARREN (0S)

Erik thinks about it

ERIK
(sincere)
Yeah me too

CUT

Erik’s walking away from Darren crossing over to Nannie and
Beatriz who’re arm in arm mutually tacit and somber as they
move forward

Darren whispers at Erik failing to be discreet
DARREN (0S)

-DONT Stop it Erik it’s not the
time what are you-

Erik gives a quick turn to Darren not stopping He’s really
doing this

ERIK
Got to do this ssshhh

Erik and Nannie haven’t seen each other in months and it’s
not like Nannie’s expected to just be nice to the person
responsible for putting her best friend in the hospital

Screw it Erik goes up to Nannie

He marches alongside her for a while hesitant to speak at
first ungainly

Nannie doesn’t make eye contact Understandable

ERIK (CONTD)
Hey Nannie

No reply

ERIK (CONTD)
Just so you know things aren’t
that good for me anymore Maybe
it’s what you want to hear I
mean it’s what I wanna say ‘cuz

sorry If I could say it a jillion
times and get water-boarded or
something to prove how sorry I
really am then I’d do it So

say Tonight Right now Sorry

No reply
The tension is wicked so Erik goes for the tension breaker
ERIK (CONTD)
Grad Nite jeeez More like Bad

Even Erik gets the douche chills from his own joke

Nannie and Beatriz walk a little faster trying to keep ahead
of Erik their unwelcome intruder

ERIK (CONTD)
Nannie wait up

Just saying her name seems to stir her something fierce

NANNIE

ERIK
I know that this sucks all

anything at all saying hi or-

NANNIE
Say hi then

THWOOOOOOOM-BOOOM

The aerial camera quickly pulls out a GIANT FLASH distorting
the video signal

The chopper now about a mile away from Wild Works is rocked
by the shock-wave of the missile hit

The video signal settles allowing us to see what is

ostensibly a fiery thick-smoked mushroom cloud (non-nuclear)
forming over the heart of the theme park

EXT CARNIVAL GAMES WILD WORKS THEME PARK -— CONTINUOUS

Don’t you freakin’ dare stop
filming dude Keep filming

Darren tilts the camera up to the night sky where the
gargantuan mushroom cloud is towering above them

FLAMING DEBRIS and chunks of concrete hail down all around
them

Darren latches onto Nannie pulling her by the arm not
letting go even a little bit

NANNIE
WHERE’RE WE GOING

DARREN (0S)
KEEP-TO-ME KEEP-TO-ME

A piece of flaming metallic material whistles past their
heads

A separate group of kids fifty meters ahead of our guys
become victim to the metallic debris

Two males are lanced straight through their torsos cutting
them into buttery pieces and a female catches on fire and
falls forward dead

Darren chooses not to film this in its entirety we get the
gist as he forces the camera off-kilter running at the same
time

CUT

Darren and Nannie slide under the awning of a games tent
ducking for cover

In the mayhem of the explosion and ensuing hail of debris
theyve lost track of Erik Jessica and Beatriz

They begin calling out desperate

Wide angle on the damaged alien ship spewing smoke and
charred ember from the missile’s point of impact The ship’s

not as damaged as one would expect

The top of the alien ship a rotating chrome dome activates
and rises up

It’s protruding upward fifty feet high like the periscope
of a submarine

Its rotation intensifies into a fast spin a warring pinwheel
unlike anything ever seen by human eyes

Flashes of light cyan-hued so bright they scorch the
corneas of onlookers

Suddenly ALIEN PROJECTILES shoot out of the top goops of
fire thrust in every direction 360 degrees like high-
pressure water out of a wild garden hose

It’s an extra-terrestrial cluster bomb attack

What look like jumbo artillery shells the size of humans
ALIEN PODS metallic and iridescent arc across the sky and
land in various spots throughout the theme park

EXT RECREATIONAL AREA WILD WORKS THEME PARK - SAME

FROM DARREN’S HD CAMERA

Darren and Nannie are running panting hand in hand

We hear the booming echoes of alien projectiles hitting
ground across the many acres of Wild Works

Then the unnerving whine of an incoming projectile sounds
like what you might hear in the microseconds before a rocket
blows you up

Just thirty feet away one of the alien pods lands with a
TREMOROUS THUD

Darren yanks Nannie down on instinct
CUT

They’re tucked behind some bushes under heavy foliage
decent hiding spot

Nannie looks into camera disgusted by it

NANNIE

DARREN (0S)
This is significant What we’re
seeing is significant

Still keyed up on adrenaline Nannie tries to catch her
breath

An agonizing HISS mechanical sounding

DARREN (0S) (CONTD)

CUT

The camera’s peeking past the bushes angled on the nearby
Alien Pod

The hissing sound is coming from the pod it’s opening
nitrous emissions shooting out

Its hyper-advanced gears are working a clockwork mechanism
from a distant world

NANNIE (0S)
Let’s run let’s run now like now
like-

DARREN (0S)
NO stop moving
NANNIE (0S)
No college no parties I’m gonna
die-

DARREN (0S)
Look-look-look

Triangular doors on the pod slide open revealing an open maw
of black nothingness Could be empty probably isn’t

The camera zooms in on it

We see movement Slight something awakening from its
slumber

Then the screams begin

Human screams from all around the park as things start to
come out of those pods

And the particular thing coming out of its pod in front of
Darren and Nannie is and can best be described THE BUBBLE-
GUM SLUG

The Bubble-Gum Slug is a vile alien creature

Imagine your everyday garden snail sans the shell grown to
a height just below your chest plate

Its backside is taken up by a spherical patch of ultra-thin
membrane
That membrane is red and veiny and when it fills up with
acidic snot it expands into an organic bulgy balloon like

blowing a bubble with a piece of gum (hence the name)

Except when that bubble pops the acidic snot explodes
everywhere

The red membrane is rejuvenative so the Bubble-Gum Slug
keeps on blowing up that acidic bubble a tireless killing
force

It moves with viscous undulation yet unlike an earthen
snail it moves fast It moves hungry

And it’s moving straight at Darren and Nannie
DARREN (0S) (CONTD)
Yup now we run-
EXT OUTDOOR DANCE TENT WILD WORKS THEME PARK -— JUMP CUT

We catch snippets of kids getting attacked by a menagerie of
alien creatures

It’s brutal frantic a paralyzation of the senses

Made all the more surreal by the HIP HOP MUSIC blasting over
the loudspeakers fog machine and laser effects still going

The end of the world as a dance party

GWAAAR-SLOOOOOSH

The Bubble-Gum Slug LEAPS OUT of the blanket of manufactured
fog gurgling angry vocalizations its red membrane starting

to engorge into an acidic balloon

It goes for Nannie

Darren without a millisecond of hesitation drops the camera
and protects his girl

The camera’s on its side on the dance floor askew
Darren kicks at the alien slug grabs a folding chair and

thwacks it in the cranium repeatedly with heroic purpose and
youthful vigor

Darren wants to kill this thing more than he’s ever wanted to
kill anything a bloodlust entrenched in the deepest parts of
our survivalist DNA

Nannie leaves frame for a few seconds re-enters frame

She’s bear-hugging one of the loud speakers holding it up
music blaring long wires attached

The speaker is super heavy so she struggles to carry it
over legs buckling

Meanwhile Darren is about ready to tap out against Bubble-
Gum Slug

Darren’s fallen on his butt scooting away from the creature
as it comes at him spittle and goo sloshing over Darren

Bubble-Gum Slug chomps at Darren’s feet its multi-rows of
serrated teeth bared full primed for the kill

Then Nannie catches up to them finally

She drops the immense loudspeaker directly on top of Bubble-
Gum Slug The alien’s acid bubble bursts onto itself
melting through its own skin

Sparks and smoke out of the speaker Bubble-Gum Slug
immolates into a BALL OF BLUE FIRE

The Bubble-Gum Slug is no more

Nannie is exhausted sweating thrilled Darren’s only
alleviated convinced he was just about to meet his Maker

Nannie jumps up and down hollering at the dead alien
monster pumped

NANNIE
YES YES YES WE KILLED YOU

A flash in the sky an explosion

Darren runs for the camera reaches down and snatches it back
up

CUT
Darren is panning the sky
An alien projectile looking like an amber comet with its
thick chemical trail streaking past dark clouds enters

frame

We follow the projectile in jittery close-up until BOOM it
collides with a Black Hawk

The Black Hawk spins out of control aflame

Darren and Nannie step back unsure of where this helicopter
might end up crashing

Nannie points at something off-screen unnerved

NANNIE
Sky Tours it’s right there dude-

On cue Darren whip-pans over to the large free-standing
tower in the distance

It’s Sky Tours a 30-story tall attraction with an
unencumbered 360-degree viewing deck at its very top

The tower’s crown has in giant flashing LED-lit letters
“GRAD NITE 2015”

And the careening Black Hawk is on a collision course with
it

expressionless in its terror

They’re crying screaming praying to God
These are their last moments alive and they know it

The Black Hawk in a complete tailspin teeters dangerously
close

Then just when the helicopter disappears below frame a
moment of hope the deck’s plexi-glass barrier explodes
inward

A shattered tail rotor flies at camera an airburst of frame-
enveloping fire

She says it in that stern but sweet way Catches Darren off-

he’s turned his attention over to Nannie

Her face says it all the fear and vulnerability

EXT PHANTASMA WILD WORKS THEME PARK - NIGHT

Darren keeps at Nannie’s backside as they snake up Phantasm’s
entry ramp

The entrance to the indoor haunted maze is done in the facade
of a decrepit Victorian-style manor replete with giant oaken
double-doors

A GUTTURAL ROAR spooks them

Darren turns the camera toward something on the other side of
the gate the auto-focus takes a few seconds to adjust

Kids are being chased by THE SLIPSHOD a tentacled alien
beast with a long wiry snout that serves as a quick-jab
stinger

Its stinger finds a SPIRITED GIRL with a painted-on mask
representing her school colors

The stinger goes straight through her neck puncturing it
clean The Slipshod flinging her body high into the air with
the flair of a triumphant predator

If Darren and Nannie weren’t moving fast enough before they
sure are now

Kids jump the gate cutting Darren and Nannie off in their
rush to get inside to safety

Darren doesn’t notice it at first he’s busy running his ass
off but the couple of kids just ahead of them seeking refuge
inside the attraction should look familiar

One of them is Gilbert senior valedictorian and Darren’s bus
buddy

INT PHANTASMA WILD WORKS THEME PARK - SECONDS LATER

Gilbert and a few of his student council compatriots are
pushing up against the double-doors closing it off from
anyone else trying to get in

excited

Kids trapped on the outside start pounding on the double-
doors shouting to let them in desperate

against the door)

haphazardly by his thigh as he squeezes past Gilbert to try
and open the doors

Gilbert blocks Darren fists clenched ready to fight to
prevent anyone else from getting in

survive above all others

That’s it Gilbert’s getting slugged

Darren charges Gilbert the camera slaps wildly by their hips
in the scuffle

Darren knocks Gilbert back with a clean punch to the jaw who
falls onto his posterior punch-drunk

Darren’s at the double-doors all clear as he pulls them
wide open letting in the desperate stragglers

It’s Erik Jessica and a handful of other kids who bum-rush
their way inside Phantasma’s entryway

ERIK

Jessica casts her eyes downward taciturn Erik looks to
Darren shaking his head somberly

It’s hard to say something like that out loud But it’s
clear Beatriz didn’t make it

becoming an emotionally wreck she takes it in stride her
defense mechanism

The maze is a labyrinthine series of hallways with spooky
paintings and artifacts up on the walls and animatronic
ghosts and monsters that pop out at you

Darren’s at the rear of the group filming what he can using
the camera’s flip-out LCD screen for illumination

JESSICA
I don’t like scary rides like this
NANNIE
(sidles up next to
Jessica)

Me neither It’s not really a ride
though We just walk ‘till it’s
over

Jessica the cowboy teddy bear still in her possession hugs
it tight for comfort Nannie takes heed of the plush toy

NANNIE
Where’d you get that

JESSICA
What The bear

NANNIE
I think that might be mine

JESSICA
Oh Someone dropped it I guess
You can have it

Jessica offers the teddy to Nannie Nannie recognizes the
fear in Jessica’s eyes and declines

NANNIE
It’s yours don’t worry about it

Jessica nods thank you

NANNIE (CONTD)
Beatriz named it Clint Eat-wood I
mean you don’t have to name it
that but it’s kinda funny ‘cause
he’s chubby and all

Every time something pops out of the wall scaring each
gender equally Erik gets pissed He’s embarrassed to admit
the simulated scares are actually getting to him

An animatronic ghost lunges at Erik Erik yelps a bit
sounds like a squeal He tries to play it cool

ERIK
A puppet with a bedsheet How
scary

Nannie rolls her eyes beyond irritated with the guy
DARREN (0S)
Never really took you for a

squealer Erik

NANNIE
I did

DARREN (0S)
(stifling a laugh)
Or a jumper

ERIK
Oh come on It’s called flight or
fight It’s a natural response to
things coming at your face

NANNIE
Things coming at your face is that
something you have a lot of
experience in

Nannie’s passive-aggressive jokes take a toll on Erik His
embarrassment turns to anger

Erik punches at the ghost rips its springy body into base
sections He launches what’s left of the animatronic across
the hallway steaming mad

NANNIE (CONTD)
Uh-oh someone’s drinking their
morning Muscle Milk

Erik stands up to Nannie

ERIK
Can I say what I’m thinking

NANNIE
Thinking hmm You allowed to do
that during the week or is it more
a weekend treat for you

Darren positions himself in-between Nannie and Erik senses
how out of control this could get

DARREN (0S)
Hey remember that time we were
trying to survive an alien
invasion Let’s get back to that

Even Jessica gets in on the action puts a reassuring hand on
Nannie’s shoulder

JESSICA
(to Nannie)
Maybe this isn’t the greatest time

NANNIE
(to Jessica eyes locked
on Erik)

NANNIE (CONTD)
The greatest time is something my
best friend in the world wouldn’t
know anything about She’s hooked
up to machines in a hospital bed
while the guy responsible for
putting her there gets to go out
and celebrate Grad Nite with roller
coasters and over-priced churros
Princess Erik gets the fairy tale
ending and a girl named Autumn
gets the nightmare

Erik is flattened by this he steels himself accordingly

ERIK
not fair that’s not fair

Nannie scoots closer to Erik teasing him with a cocky
“bring-it-on” smile

NANNIE
You obviously got jumbo nards
coming to Wild Works all guilt-
free So use ‘em Say what you’re
thinking

ERIK
I think you wish I were dead That
Id been killed tonight Or or-

make out in the dim lighting Jet black liquid is pouring
out his nostrils
It’s not blood It’s something else entirely

What is thi- The hell-

TONIGHT I HATE MY LIFE-

Eeeeeaaaaagggh

A Shrieking Zombie Bride drops from the ceiling glow-in-the-
dark and swipes the top of Jessica’s head with its tattered
overflowing gown

Jessica looks into camera deadpan

JESSICA (CONTD)
- was I saying something

Beat

Thwooom Jessica’s plucked clean out of frame up toward the
ceiling She’s being hoisted up by The Crawler the alien-
human hybrid

JESSICA (CONTD)
DARRRRREEEEEEEEENNNNN

The Crawler SNAPS Jessica’s neck killing her It carries
Jessicas limp body up a wall past the rafters and through
a clawed-out hole in the roof

CUT

Up ahead glowing red exit signs

Darren’s sprinting as are Nannie and Erik Erik’s having
the most trouble doing so out of the three

Doesn’t matter as long as they’re moving they’re surviving

Behind them the shrill echoes of The Crawler screeching
braying Threatening to catch up to them in an instant

Coming up are the exit doors

Darren picks up speed now flanking Nannie and Erik the
camera all herky-jerky

EXT THE EATERY WILD WORKS THEME PARK - NIGHT

Darren’s filming seven newly-arrived Black Hawks as they
hover over Wild Work’s central hub Rappelling ropes are
dropped from the helicopters as soldiers ready to enter the
heart of the park

Hyper-real imagery only seen in video games

Military helo’s in the sky explosions going off giant
ferris wheel and roller coasters ablaze

NANNIE (0S)
Get in here Darren come on

The angle tilts down where Nannie’s signaling at Darren to
follow her into the cafeteria-style eatery

INT THE EATERY WILD WORKS THEME PARK - MOMENTS LATER

Darren and Nannie are hiding out beneath the table of a
booth Erik’s under a table directly opposite their booth
They lie in wait exhausted

We hear the sounds of battle outside the eatery It’s
getting louder and more intense

CUT

Darren gently zooms in on Erik who’s got his eyes closed and
is praying silently to himself

NANNIE (0S)
(sotto to Darren re
filming Erik)
Don’t be disrespectful

Darren zooms out turns the camera on Nannie Her face is
almost right up to the lens they’re huddled so tight

DARREN (0S)
(sotto to Nannie)
You were gnawing his nuts off an
hour ago now you care

Nannie smirks enigmatically She doesn’t have to answer
that

NANNIE
What do we do next

It swiftly dawns on Darren the answer

DARREN (0S)
I think I uh might know

NANNIE
What What say it-

DARREN (0S)
You pick up one of those little map
brochures

Nannie mulls it over reaches into her pockets then finds
it A crumpled map brochure the sort theme parks give out
to visitors upon entry

Darren lays the camera down on the tile floor

We watch as Darren unfolds the brochure into a spread an
illustrated map of the entire park

EXT UH-60 BLACK HAWK HELICOPTER - NIGHT

FROM A SOLDIER’S HELMET CAM

We’re seeing the first person POV of an unknown unnamed
SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIER as he rappells down a rope from the
side of the helicopter

He’s descending rapidly fifty feet in about three seconds

EXT CENTRAL HUB WILD WORKS THEME PARK —- CONTINUOUS

The Soldier touches ground detaches his cable grip poises
his burst-fire ASSAULT RIFLE

His team’s already on ground waiting for him Seven
soldiers total they venture forward Weapons aimed

INT THE EATERY WILD WORKS THEME PARK - NIGHT
FROM DARREN’S HD CAMERA

Darren’s pointing out on the map where he was able to sneak
into the park earlier

DARREN
-there the storage area

NANNIE
How though

DARREN
Perimeter fence it’s not too high
We hop over it leads right into a
residential street

NANNIE
And you already did this Snuck
in

Darren shrugs his shoulders “yep”

NANNIE (CONTD)
Why

DARREN
(re camera)
Security would’ve park-blocked me

Nannie uses her pointer finger and thumb to measure on the
map the distance between where they’re presently at the
eatery to the storage area It’s not an easy trek

NANNIE
I dunno like could we even make
it that far without you know

DARREN
(sullen)
Yeah I know

Darren studies the map considers a shortcut There’s one
major obstacle in the way of getting to the storage area and
it’s a water ride

Woodchip Rapids an American Frontier-themed river rafting
ride

DARREN (CONTD)
(lost in thought)
gonna get wet definitely

Nannie furrows her brow pinches Darren’s chin and lifts his
head so they’re making eye contact

NANNIE
Uh who’s getting wet

Darren points it out to her on the map

DARREN
See Woodchip Rapids See this main
part of the river Storage area’s
kitty-corner to it It’s right
there easy So

NANNIE
We jump the river

DARREN
We can’t jump it river’s too wide

Nannie deflates her anxiety getting the best of her

NANNIE
I know you’re gonna say we have to
swim across it but for like five
seconds can we pretend you’re not
gonna say we have to swim across
it

Darren’s not looking at Nannie anymore His eyes are trained
on something off-camera

DARREN
Erik

Darren scoots forward under the table accidently knocking
the camera so it’s facing the rest of the room

We see Erik standing his back to us As still as a tree

NANNIE (0S)
Lay low Erik what are you doing

DARREN (0S)
Erik

Erik’s not responding he’s not moving Then a boyish timbre
calls out presumably from Erik The voice morphs into an
inhuman growl

Erik turns around revealing his face

The black goo has metastasized molding Erik’s facial
features into a sinister rictus His eyeballs are missing

his eye sockets brimming with thumb-sized orange-hued worms

He opens his mouth wide jaw muscles ripping apart an alien
battle cry

Erik’s no longer Erik he’s an alien-human hybrid

ErikIt doubles over hisits spine convexing unnaturally
until INSECT-LIKE WINGS sprout out of the skin of hisits
back

ErikIt is THE GLIDER

Its wings ramp up for flight then it ascends off its feet
hitting the ceiling at first eventually crashing out a
broken window

The Glider is gone outside

Darren immediately reaches for the camera turns the lens on
himself and Nannie

They’re just sitting there gaping out of breath adrenaline
spiking What in the name of Satan’s army did they just
witness
DARREN (CONTD)
(freaked)
I vow to become an alcoholic for
the rest of my-

Gunfire just outside

EXT THE EATERY WILD WORKS THEME PARK - SAME

FROM A SOLDIER’S HELMET CAM

In the style of a first-person shooter

The Special Forces Soldier and his team are surrounded by
alien creatures They’re firing at-will hitting and killing

what they can

It’s much too overwhelming for the soldiers even for highly-
trained killers such as themselves

Soon our first-person POV is the only one left standing
The other soldiers are dead except for us (the unknown
unnamed Special Forces Soldier)

We’re attacked from the side

Our perspective becomes blurred wild We hear the Soldiers
bones snap his screams of agony

A speck of blood hits the lens of the helmet cam

The Soldier stops screaming stops moving Our perspective
freezes we’re stuck looking up at the night sky

The alien predators leave him there dead
Except he isn’t dead not yet

SOLDIER (0S)
Help

We hear the Soldier choke through a throatful of blood He’s
fading fast

SOLDIER (OS) (CONT’D)
HELP please

A laborious beat of helplessness

Then voices hushed human They’re approaching us somewhat
familiar

MALE VOICE (0S)
-c’mon just help me then

FEMALE VOICE (0S)
This is yonkers we’re gonna-

MALE VOICE (0S)
-get his arms I got his legs

The male and female enter frame It’s Darren and Nannie and
they assist the Soldier in getting him to safety

Darren’s got him by the legs Nannie by the arms We’re
dragged twenty feet over blacktop before entering the doors
of the eatery

INT THE EATERY WILD WORKS THEME PARK - CONTINUOUS

The Soldier’s arm enters frame he grabs Darren by the
shoulder urgent

SOLDIER (0S)
-gun fire a gun you know how to

DARREN
(shaking his head)
No Not at all-

NANNIE
I do

Darren looks to Nannie confounded

DARREN
You do

NANNIE
(ignoring Darren to
Soldier)
I’ve handled weapons before
Sergeant I mean nothing this
big but-

SOLDIER (0S)
-sfine here-

Without hesitation the Soldier hands his assault rifle over
to Nannie Nannie cocks the weapon confident

Darren’s equal parts impressed and scared shitless

DARREN
‘Kay Cool

SOLDIER (0S)
(coughing violently)
-my helmet take it s’got visual
targeting display night
vision

Nannie reaches in to unclasp the dying Soldier’s helmet She
picks it up fits it over her head Once it’s adjusted to a
reasonably comfortable position we are

FROM NANNIE’S HELMET CAM
She looks down at the Soldier His torso is a gored mess

SOLDIER (CONTD)
- they’1l bomb the park the
whole place no survivors

Nannie exchanges a glance with Darren startled by the
Soldier’s warning

NANNIE (0S)
Wh- When-

SOLDIER
«-- Soon Go get

The Soldier takes his final excruciating breaths waving them
off direly their protector

SOLDIER (CONT’D)
«-- go now Go LEAVE-

EXT WOODCHIP RAPIDS WILD WORKS THEME PARK - NIGHT
Nannie’s assault rifle is aimed at the ready

Nannie and Darren are at the edge of a controlled FAST-
MOVING RIVER the aforementioned obstacle standing in-between
them and the park’s storage area (ie an escape from Wild
Works)

DARREN
Let’s just jump now let’s not even
think about it

NANNIE (0S)
No dude Water’s moving too fast
well get swept or-

DARREN
Or what We don’t have time for
anything else

NANNIE (0S)
Like I’m not going out Natalie
Wood style I’m just not-

Glrreeeeuuuaaasshk

We (Nannie) see movement in the treetops where the sound
came from An alien monster is stalking them daring them to
inch closer

Nannie raises the assault rifle FIRES

The trees explode with burst-fire rounds The monster sails
off a tree down onto the grass coming straight at Nannie
and Darren

DARREN (0S)
The boat jump

Nannie whips her head around sees what Darren’s referring
to

An automated raft boat as part of the ride is drifting down
the river close enough to hop into

Darren jumps first landing sloppily He’s on the raft boat
beckoning Nannie to follow suit

The monster only gets closer its talons pounding against wet
grass

NANNIE (0S)
Oh god whatever

Nannie hurls herself over the barrier rapid waters just
below her We fall through the air colliding onto one of
the seats on the raft boat

She’s now alongside Darren safely on the boat

The monster’s kept at bay above them unwilling to get
anywhere near the water

The raft boat continues down the river until it enters the
indoors section of the thrill ride It’s a faux mining
mountain and it’s mostly in complete darkness

INT MINING MOUNTAIN WOODCHIP RAPIDS WILD WORKS THEME PARK -
CONTINUOUS
Again in the style of a first-person shooter

The night vision kicks on Nannie bears the assault rifle in
frame like a true soldier albeit she’s trembling a bit

The raft boat goes through the motions as if it’s any ole’
night at the theme park Twists and turns and sudden drops
Water splashing the seats

In the darkness we hear the clatter and clucking of alien
creatures They’re inside the mountain they can be
anywhere

Nannie waits for the first sign of movement And when she
sees that first sign she engages in ALL-OUT GUNFIRE

Burst-fire rounds plink off the mining set Creatures are
shot wounded They’re coming out of the darkness from all
angles

Chk-FTHOOM Chk-FTHOOM Chk-FTHOOM

Nannie is firing with great fervor the assault rifle’s
percussive blasts reverberating harshly indoors

Darren is cowering down on the raft protecting his head as
hot shell casings land atop his back

The assault rifle clicks empty

NANNIE (0S)
I’m out shit

The ride is over we’re outside again
EXT DISEMBARKING STATION WOODCHIP RAPIDS WILD WORKS THEME
PARK -— CONTINUOUS

Their raft boat slows to a crawl as it sidles up next to a
disembarking station

Darren gets out first lends a hand to Nannie

As Nannie steps up on solid ground she’s blind-sided thrown
twenty feet landing on her stomach

The helmet cam loses fidelity starts to crackle and buzz
from the force of impact

Nannie turns over the wind knocked out of her incapable of
vocalizing anything other than a pained gasp
We see what’s attacking her
It’s THE HUNCHBACK GOBLIN it’s really an alien of course
But to the human eye goblin would be the best descriptor for
it

The goblin is hopping its way toward Nannie its salivary
glands drooping like snot out of its open maw

Nannie prepares for the end for an insufferable death

Then another alien creature swoops in landing atop the
goblin killing it Saving Nannie

The Glider aka Erik
The GliderErik gawks at Nannie an oddly sympathetic beat

There’s something very human about the way it stands there
although it isn’t quite human anymore

The Glider takes off into the air leaving an emotional
Nannie and a bewildered Darren

Darren helps Nannie up

DARREN
Was that

NANNIE (0S)
I think
(beat)
Yes

Darren unclasps Nannie’s helmet

DARREN
Let’s get this off-
EXT POLICE CHOPPER ABOVE THE CITY - NIGHT
FROM AN AERIAL CAMERA
We crash-zoom in on two B-2 STEALTH BOMBERS as they hurtle
over Wild Work’s airspace dropping a ticker tape parade of

CLUSTER BOMBS

The bombers’ primary target is the crashed extra-terrestrial
spacecraft

However huge swaths of the park are instantly ignited like a
gasoline-drenched matchbook

EXT STORAGE AREA WILD WORKS THEME PARK - NIGHT
FROM SECURITY CAM
Grainy black-and-white soundless

Darren and Nannie hand-in-hand are running dodging debris
There is no escape not even at the edge of the park
They’re walled in by fire

They run into a storage unit for cover

INT STORAGE UNIT WILD WORKS THEME PARK - MOMENTS LATER
FROM DARREN’S HD CAMERA

Darren and Nannie together on the dingy floor Sweaty
bloody out of breath

Darren sits the camera opposite them so they’re both in
frame

DARREN
(into camera)
Hey Autumn I set out to give you
the virtual Grad Nite experience
Here we are Nuts huh

Outside an explosion

DARREN (CONTD)
(to Nannie)
Wanna say something to her

Nannie appears to muster courage braving the camera as
though it was Autumn herself sitting there

NANNIE
(into camera poker-faced)
Yeah tonight blew Like big time
Never again You lucked out
Autumn Trust me

Outside another explosion bigger

DARREN
(into camera)

It could’ve went smoother
(MORE)

DARREN (CONTD)
Other than that Id say it was
well worth my 145 bucks Two
tickets aka half of my entire
savings

Darren probes Nannie with a withering stare

NANNIE
What You offered to pay your
fault

CUT
Darren and Nannie forget the camera for a while

NANNIE (CONTD)
You know UCSB has this thing the
first week of classes All the
freshmen get to dress like their
favorite characters dance and get
blitzed around a humongous bonfire
‘till like six in the morning
Right on the beach They call it
“Bonfire of the Insanities”

DARREN
Get outta here really

Outside another explosion the biggest yet
DARREN (CONTD)
Can I come visit my very cool girl

at her very cool school sometime

NANNIE
Hell yeah son

They bump fists snuggle tighter ready to die
The storage unit vibrates shifting on its foundation of wood
palettes Fire is creeping into the storage unit the

aluminum walls buckling under intense heat

The camera is vibrating falling over heat waves distorting
the lens

The concrete beneath the storage unit’s foundation splits
open what is seemingly an EARTHQUAKE in full effect

Mammoth blasts of PULSATING AIR knock out the flames
entrenching the storage unit as easily a child would his
birthday candles

Intense ultraviolet rays bounce off the camera lens in
conjunction with the HEAVING BOOMS of a great terrible
machine attempting to start up

These are sounds akin to the space shuttle lifting off at
Cape Canaveral

The concrete splits open wider tipping the camera over

Our perspective free falls through the air before landing on
a bed of muddy gravel streams of dirt and mesh hitting the
camera from above

We see water rushing past the gravel down a pitch black
tunnel

WE ARE IN

INT UNDERGROUND WATER MAIN WILD WORKS THEME PARK -

Entering from the top of frame Nannie’s legs dangle as
Darren lowers her into the tunnel

NANNIE
Slower slower-

DARREN (0S)
Let go it’s not that deep-

NANNIE
Don’t you let me go wait wait-

Nannie’s feet dip into the deluge of water she gains ground

She’s ducking her head and making room for Darren as he’s
now lowering himself down

Darren’s on his feet the water drenching his jeans

Darren and Nannie scoot closer to camera away from the
opening in the ground

There they wait hunched over in the tunnel listening to the
furious dissonance of what they presume is the world coming
to an end

Outside above ground a sternum-punching POP a WHOOSH and
then all is silent For the first time in many hours

All we hear are shrill breaths the babble of water

EXT WILD WORKS THEME PARK - MORNING

The sun’s just up and Darren’s panning the camera along the
devastation of the theme park It’s unbelievable

A place of amusement reduced to a place of annihilation

We zoom in on Wild Work’s central hub on the MASSIVELY EMPTY
CRATER where the extra-terrestrial spacecraft once lay

DARREN (0S)

Nannie doesn’t buy it climbs up a railing to get a better
view

down like he’s a patient escapee
