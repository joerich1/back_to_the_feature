DETERMINED”

FADE IN

INT KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT 1

CLOSE ON KATE HANNAH -- late-20s pretty and wholesome and
oh yeah piss drunk She stands on a tiny

KARAOKE STAGE

in the far corner of a half-empty dive bar

Kate holds a MICROPHONE and dances as she SINGS a bad karaoke
version of “SONG TO BE DETERMINED” What Kate lacks in talent
she more than makes up for with charm and enthusiasm

At a table near the stage is --

-- CHARLIE HANNAH Kate’s husband late-20’s scruffy but
handsome also pretty damn drunk He enthusiastically claps

and points to Kate making up a cheering section along with --

-- OWEN HANNAH -- Charlie’s younger brother early-20s --
who sings along with --

-- the small but energetic CROWD
Kate begins to ramble between verses -- and gleefully points
to Charlie and Owen For the moment this drunk girl is the

Queen of Karaoke

LATER
Kate finishes the song and drunkenly tumbles off the stage to
join Charlie and Owen

CHARLIE
That was so good baby

KATE
Bullshit

CHARLIE
I’m serious You sing like an angel
-- a drunk angel

Owen and Kate LAUGH

KATE
If you were writing about my
performance for your blog what
would you say

CHARLIE
Id say that uhmy wife is the
sexiest most amazing woman alive

KATE
That would be such a shitty article
-- nobody would read it

Kate and Charlie laugh and kiss -- and then Kate glances at
Owen and makes a puppy dog face

KATE (CONTD)
(to Owen)
Awwe need to find you a lady
Owen

OWEN
Yeah -- I’ve been trying to flirt
with the bartender butI can’t
tell

Owen motions to the --
-- FEMALE BARTENDER early 20s

KATE
She’s hot What can’t you tell

OWEN
She looks like she could kick my
ass No way would she go for a guy
like me
KATE
You’re being a little girl -- just
go talk to her

OWEN
(clearly shy)
I don’t knowforget about it

KATE
(not going to take “no”
for an answer)
I’1l take point -- follow me

Kate stumbles to the bar Charlie and Owen follow Kate puts
her arms around Owen and gets the attention of the bartender

KATE (CONTD)
I want to buy a gimlet for me and a
double-shot of whiskey for my
brother-in-law ‘cause he’s had a
hard week

FEMALE BARTENDER
‘Kay

The bartender quickly pours the drinks

FEMALE BARTENDER (CONT’D)
That’s fifteen

KATE
Wait -- don’t you wanna know what
happened to him

The bartender rolls her eyes and checks around the bar to see
if there are other customers It’s pretty dead -- so she
listens

FEMALE BARTENDER
(unenthused)
What happened

KATE

He just got back from England --
because he went there for a girl A
preppy bitchy girl Diane
Courtthat was her name He loved
her so much that he went with her
because she had a fellowship or
something He gave up being a
kickboxer A kickboxer

(sad)
And she dumped him
The bartender sizes up Owen The trio waits with anticipation
to hear her response which is --

FEMALE BARTENDER
(to Owen)
You kickbox

OWEN
(caught in the headlights)
Yeah

Andthat’s all Owen’s got

KATE
(jumping in)
And he teaches kids at the
kickboxing studio Oh they’re so
cute

The bartender glances back to Owen

OWEN
(finally)
A lot of ‘em don’t have parents --
soit’s kinda more than just a
teacherstudent thing

(beat)
I know it sounds silly but I feel
responsible for them -- like
(emotional)

-I could be their parent
Kate slides down the bar to Charlie
KATE
(hushed)
I think I got him laid

CHARLIE
Yeah

KATE
She seems totally game

CHARLIE
Sure she just didn’t want to get
into your pants

Kate rolls her eyes

KATE
I think I’m done for the night
CHARLIE
Yeah

Owen wanders over dejected

OWEN
She’s seen “Say Anything”

CHARLIE

KATE
No -- he needs to keep working it
You guys stay here

CHARLIE

not score I want to go to bed with
you and
(whispered into Kate’s
ear)
--you know

KATE
Ill be home when you get there We
can “you know” then

OWEN
(to Charlie)
Yeah man -- you don’t have a job
to wake up for in the morning or
anything

CHARLIE
Writing is a job Not having to
report to an office only makes work
harder

(to Kate)
Baby you drank a lot I think Owen
should take us home -- you’re too

drunk to drive

KATE
So’s Owen
(suddenly focused)
I’m not that drunk Besides you
know I focus when I drive -- it
sobers me up

CHARLIE

Kate kisses Charlie and hugs Owen

KATE
(to Charlie)
I love you baby I’1ll be waiting
for you in a nice warm bed You

brother laid -- and don’t talk to
any other women

Beat

CHARLIE
That sounds like two missions

KATE
No it’s just one
CHARLIE
(to Owen)

It kinda sounded like two right

OWEN
(nodding)
It did

Kate grins and slowly backs away towards the door

KATE
(really fast)

Kate is animatedly telling a story to the two guys -- who’re
still smoking crack

KATE
(mile-a-minute fast)
-’cause I feel like I understand
what it’s like to be homeless ya
know I mean if you didn’t know
me if we hadn’t connected tonight
you might think “There’s some
upper-middle-class NPR listening
self-congratulatory insulated
lazy liberal bitch Probably never
had to worry about anything” But
that’s not true at all I grew up
oor man Single mother
McDonald’s used to have one day a
week where they sold 29 cent
hamburgers and another day where
they had 39 cent cheeseburgers My
mom and me would go there and she’d
get twenty burgers -- that was the
limit probably set up for folks
just like us -- and then she’d put
‘em in the freezer and we’d
microwave ‘em for dinner throughout
the week

classroom Through the glass she sees --

-- Mr Davies He notices Kate and smiles (the concerned
smile you give someone right after they’ve publicly
embarrassed themselves)

Kate mouths the words --

KATE
(silent)
Thank you

-- and gestures “come here”

Mr Davies gestures to the class that he’ll be right back --
before he walks out to talk to Kate He’s got a slightly
nervous demeanor -- somewhere between “I never became
comfortable talking to women” and Asperger’s

MR DAVIES
Is everything umokay Mrs
Hannah

KATE

Yeah wellI’m really embarrassed
-- but I feel a lot better And I
just wanted to say thank you

drinking

Kate gives Charlie a dirty look

CHARLIE (CONTD)

KATE
The drinking led to the crack-
smoking The drinking leads to
everything stupid I do

where AA meets)

Kate LAUGHS

KATE

CHARLIE
Remember when I was shit-faced and
took that Q and A pamphlet from
there

KATE
(laughs)
Holy shit And we answered “yes” to
like every question and at the end
it was like “If you answered ‘yes’
to any of these you’re an
alcoholic”

Kate smiles and nods

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
Hey --

to new chicks but there are lots
of women here who can help you out

KATE
(confused)
Okay
(beat)
Do I just sit wherever

DONOVAN
The meeting already started so just
try to find a spot anywhere

Kate drunkenly stumbles to the back of the room saying
things like “sorry” and “I like that jacket” as she takes a
seat next to two very CLEAN CUT WOMEN

As the woman at the podium continues to speak the women next
to Kate quietly try to welcome her

LILY
Are you new

KATE
To this Yeah Why’s everyone
whispering

SHANA
Its hard huh

KATE
I guess

LILY
Everything’s going to be fine
You’re home

Kate doesnt respond -- just looks around with the fear
anyone would have if they felt they had just accidentally
joined Jim Jones’ church

LATER
The room is COMPLETELY FULL -- with over ONE-HUNDRED PEOPLE
The tattooed man stands at the podium
TATTOO MAN
Not to embarrass anyone but so
that we may get to know you better -
- is there anybody here in their

first thirty days of recovery

Several PEOPLE scattered throughout the room stand up and
introduce themselves as alcoholics

Kate stands up
KATE

little drunk right now
People burst into LAUGHTER
KATE (CONTD)

Do you want me to talk about my
childhood or something

TATTOO MAN
(painfully polite)
You know Kate we actually ask
that you don’t share if you’ve had
a drink or any mind-altering
substance in the past 24 hours

KATE

(not listening)
I can -- I kinda hate my dad and
don’t talk to him And my momoh
manI don’t even know where to
start She’s like stuck in the
80’s and kind of a metalhead Her
last boyfriend called himself a
drummer but really just gave drum
lessons to little kids and --

TATTOO MAN
(tries to shut Kate up)
Welcome Kate
(forces a smile)
It gets better

KATE
(not picking up the hint)
I like drinking is the thing I
mean I don’t want to say you guys
are wrong or anything

Kate nervously LAUGHS

Some of the PEOPLE in the crowd look embarrassed for Kate

TATTOO MAN
Thank you -- we’re all here to
help We do have to move on

though
The woman next to Kate gets her to sit back down

LILY
Don’t worry sweetie -- there’ll be
plenty of time to tell your story

A young woman -- AMBER 22 -- approaches the podium

AMBER
Hey Im Amber alcoholic I cant
really believe that its been five
years I mean my life was a mess
back then Now Im back in school
I have an amazing man I love my
parents -- its crazy

KATE
(way too loud)
How old is that girl Can she even
go to bars
(to Amber)
How old are you Amber

SHANA
Be respectful

Kate seems surprised at being chastised

AMBER
(gaining intensity)
Umokay Its because I did the
work I got down on my knees and
prayed every night I went toa
meeting everyday

KATE
Everyday

AMBER
It wasnt easy but Ive gotta say
I owe everything to AA Well AA --
and God of course

The whole room APPLAUDS
LATER

Everyone is standing holding hands and saying the SERENITY
PRAYER

EVERYONE
God grant me the serenity to accept
the things I cannot change --
courage to change the things I can -
- and wisdom to know the
difference

KATE
AMEN

Everyone turns and looks at Kate
KATE (CONTD)
(embarrassed)

OkayI think I’m good

Kate quickly leaves the meeting as clumsily as she arrived

EXT KATE and CHARLIE’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT 22
Kate chugs frozen Margarita straight from a PITCHER

KATE
So much for that

Kate and Charlie stand in their backyard which is criss-
crossed by WHITE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS and has some old LAWN
FURNITURE

They drunkenly play CROQUET

CHARLIE
Was it a bunch of old biker guys

KATE
No it wasI dont know
Enthusiastic people A lot of
really ENTHUSIASTIC PEOPLE

CHARLIE
Yuck -- I hate enthusiasm Im

Charlie thinks for a moment

CHARLIE (CONT’D)
I can’t really imagine never
drinking I guess I don’t have to
though --
(beat)
-- you’re the one with the problem

Kate nods in agreement
CHARLIE (CONT’D)

to have to drink

KATE

CHARLIE
(sincere)

Charlie leans in to kiss Kate They make out for a moment
and then Kate

BITES Charlie’s lip Charlie pulls back shocked Kate
grins mischievously

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Oh no you didn’t

Charlie lunges at Kate who dodges him and LAUGHS Charlie
dives and playfully tackles Kate They begin to wrestle in

the grass -- it’s cute and loving but perhaps a little too
intense
INT KATE and CHARLIE’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 23

Kate and Charlie are making out on the bed Kate starts to
unbutton Charlies shirt As it turns out Charlie’s
extremely drunk (and its apparent in his movements and
voice)

CHARLIE
Are you trying to have some sex

Kate removes Charlies pants and takes off her clothing She
climbs on top of him and --

-- they start having sloppy drunk sex

After a few beats Kate notices that Charlie isnt moving
She looks down to discover that --

-- he’s passed out

Kate pauses for a momentthen continues to ride her
unconscious husband

INT KATE and CHARLIE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 24
Kate drinks what’s left in the TEQUILA BOTTLE as she
drunkenly searches the fridge counter and cupboard for more
booze She finds a few sips here and there at the bottom of a
couple BEER BOTTLES -- but she seems frustrated that there
isn’t more alcohol in the house

A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Kate puts on her slippers robe and --

EXT STREET - NIGHT 25

Kate drunkenly rides a BICYCLE down the street (still in her
robe and slippers)

INT CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT 26
Kate tries to open the LOCKED glass fridge where the BEER is
kept After several attempts she gives up and grabs TWO
BOTTLES OF WINE from a shelf

Kate sets the bottles on the counter

The CLERK -- a tired looking man in his 30’s -- looks at Kate
with pity
CLERK
You know I can’t sell you this
Kate
An ELDERLY MAN -- shopping for frozen food -- glances over at
Kate
KATE
What You can’t tell I’m 21 Come
on -- I’m in here all the time You
know me
CLERK

Yes I do Kate And I know you’re
old enough -- but it’s too late

The clerk holds up his WATCH (which reads 245)
KATE
C’mon -- we can just pretend it’s

before two

Kate reaches down and tries to rewind the clerk’s watch

CLERK
(not amused)
Stop it
KATE

It’s just a little wine I’m not
driving or anything

CLERK
I don’t think so Sorry

Kate gives him a big flirty smile
KATE
Come on dude -- I’1ll let you have

a sip if you want

Kate tries to do a “sexy” dance

CLERK
It’s the law I can’t sell alcohol
after 2 am You know that

KATE
Why don’t you give it to me then
That wouldn’t hurt anything A gift
-- because were friends

CLERK
I could lose my job

Kate doesn’t have anything to say back -- so she glances at
the Elderly Man in the frozen food section

KATE
(to the elderly man meant
to be a whisper but way
too loud)
You distract him okay

The elderly man puts up his hands not wanting any part of
it
CLERK
Look -- why don’t you get a bottle
of water or a coffee or something
instead

KATE
Water or coffee Fuck you What --
just cause I won’t suck your dick

CLERK
(had enough)
Oh my god Okay enough -- you
gotta go

Kate doesn’t budge

CLERK (CONTD)
Seriously Kate You should go

KATE
Fuck you Fuck you Fuck you

Kate is hysterical and her eyes are starting to fill with
tears

KATE (CONTD)
This is bullshit
(beat)
I have to pee

Kate runs down the aisle and tries to open the bathroom door -
- but it’s locked She hides from view and then squats down
and begins to pull up her robe

CLERK
What the fuck are you doing

KATE
(caught)
I didn’t mean to Sometimes I just
have to pee really really bad
CLERK
(frustrated)
Get outta here NOW
KATE
(pleads)
C’moncan’t we drink together

The clerk clearly isn’t going to budge Kate nods resigned
and then

»-grabs a BOTTLE OF WINE and dashes out the door

EXT LA RIVER — DAWN 27

Kate is passed out on the concrete bank of the Los Angeles
River The empty bottle of (screw top) wine is next to her

Kate pauses when she realizes her back is wet She looks down
at the bed which is --

Mr Davies)

butts

ROCHELLE (0S)

the neighborhood’s changed After
Mr Baker passed away and the kids
put Mrs Baker in a home the
people that moved in oof

Rochelle walks in holding a tray with THREE GIN AND TONICS

ROCHELLE (CONTD)
It’s like they don’t even
understand the concept of birth
control in their country

Rochelle hands Charlie a glass and then goes to Kate and puts
a drink on the table in front of her

ROCHELLE (CONTD)

(confides)
If you ask me I think it’s a meth
house

Theyve always got those little
five year old twins “playing” in
the yard but I’m pretty sure
they’re the lookouts

touched her drink)
What’s wrong honey Think I forgot
how to mix ‘em

KATE

Rochelle tears up with joy

ROCHELLE (CONTD)

Oh -- that’s so exciting I’m gonna
be a grandma

-- an abandoned Christmas-themed amusement park (with giant
ginger bread houses plastic Christmas trees etc) in the

middle of the woods Creepy and nostalgic at the same time
Looks like the set of a Christmas horror film

Kate holds Charlie’s hand as she leads him around

KATE
This place shut down a decade ago
and then there was a fire and now
it’s basically abandoned

Charlie seems totally impressed by the weirdness of the
place

KATE (CONTD)
We came here every year the week
before Christmas

(MORE )

KATE (CONTD)

And then I worked here in high
school -- selling hot chocolate
And they had real reindeer too
They kept ‘em over there

Kate points at the remains of a PEN

My mom worked here when she was
younger I think everyone who grew
up around here worked at Santa’s
Village at some point

Charlie just nods and listens -- he’s in awe of this place

This is what I think of when I
think of Christmas
(long beat)
Thanks for coming up here with me

CHARLIE
Of course
KATE
I’m sorry my mom’s so awful

moment And then Charlie asks --

Did you ever hook up with guys when
you worked here

KATE
Huh
CHARLIE
You know -- sneak off with a co-

worker and do it against a pine
tree or something

KATE
Umno

CHARLIE
I mean if I were a teenage boy
working with a stone cold fox like
you I’d totally want to hook up
with you here Likein the ginger

A little girl -- ISABEL -- raises her hand
KATE
Yes
ISABEL
Mrs Hannah -- shouldn’t you be
more fatter
KATE
What
ISABEL
‘Cause of the baby My mom got real
fat
KATE

(taken off-guard)
Well”Shouldn’t you be fatter”
is the correct way to ask that
question

Kate goes back to the board -- clearly wanting to move on

KATE (CONTD)
Now one day when you’re very old
and wise fourth graders you’1l
learn about multiplication and --

ISABEL
Mrs Hannah -- Shouldn’t you be
more fat

All the students look at Kate She’s on the spot Flustered

KATE
Well I

Kate searches for something to say Anything But then she
blurts --

KATE (CONTD)
-I’m not going to have a baby

CLASS
OOOH

Kate immediately looks like she wishes she could take it
back

KATE
See -- I was pregnant but it
wasn’t my time I suppose

Another little girl -- WINNIE -- jumps in
WINNIE
Mrs Hannah -- did you kill the
baby
KATE
WHAT No -- of course not
WINNIE

‘Cause my mom says that when you
kill a baby you go to hell and you
can’t even go to church to ask god
for forgiveness

The students begin to WHISPER to each other
Another boy -- TOBY -- asks --

TOBY
Mrs Hannah -- are you going to
hell

KATE

No I didn’t kill my baby Okay
listen kids -- we shouldn’t be
talking about this But

(beat)
-sometimes women get pregnant and
then early on -- before it’s even a
baby -- they stop being pregnant

WINNIE
Because a doctor murders it

KATE

No -- not because a doctor murdered
it

(beat)
It’s called a miscarriage That
means it wasn’t my plan -- it’s
just what happened

(composes herself)
Does anyone want to ask me any
questions

The class nods but seems silently freaked out

KATE (CONTD)
Let’s get back to subtraction -- or
addition Or both

MR DAVIES
Well that was bound to happen at

MR DAVIES (CONTD)
But I had no idea how pro-life
little Winnie Reddy is

(beat)
Remind me to wear my “May the fetus
you save be gay” T-shirt to the
next banana split night

Kate half-laughs

MR DAVIES (CONTD)
And just think the kids got a
lesson about life and death that
nobody planned on I mean you’re
years ahead of the standard
curriculum for uh third graders

KATE
Does it matter that I lied That I
was never pregnant

MR DAVIES
You want me to answer that as a
friend or as someone who takes the
twelve steps very seriously

Kate shrugs

MR DAVIES (CONTD)

Well the good thing is that it’s
all over now Principal Barnes will
think you’re a martyr for losing a
baby

(beat)
The kids won’t ask about it anymore
and as long as you don’t toss your
cookies again you won’t have to
deal with it

KATE
(long beat)
And the bad news

MR DAVIES
You lied To your boss -- anda
bunch of small children Who trust
you And rely on you to help them
differentiate right from wrong

God Kate -- come on What else

were you supposed to do

KATE
Well I feel like a piece of shit
for lying

CHARLIE
It’s not that big a deal Jesus Is
this what those meetings teach you
To make drama out of nothing

KATE
It’s not nothing I lied to little
kids and to my boss because I can’t
take responsibility for my actions

CHARLIE
Why don’t you go and tell the
Principal that you were never
pregnant That the reason you puked
is because you smoked crack all
night Would you feel better about
yourself then

KATE
I’ve been thinking about doing
that actually
(thinks about it)
Yeah I think I would feel better
about myself

CHARLIE
Fine Do it then I guess you
don’t need a job

KATE
I could be like you -- I could stay
home drinking all day and never do
anything responsible

CHARLIE
(hurt)
I never do anything responsible
What about buying this house that
we live in Or the food that we’re
eating

KATE
Having rich parents doesn’t make
you responsible I think it’s
pretty much done the opposite

Charlie looks stunned

CHARLIE
Oh I’m sorry that I have a family
that supports us -- and not the
other way around

KATE
What the fuck is that supposed to
mean

CHARLIE

Nothing Kate But you can’t be mad
at me because my family has helped
us out You should be grateful we
don’t have to struggle

KATE

I wouldn’t care if we struggled
with money I’ve struggled with
money my whole life

(beat)
Id rather worry about where my
next meal is coming from than if I -
- in some drunken stupor -- married
a man who just wants to party and
meet bands

What the fuck are you talking
about

KATE

I’m talking about you being a baby
A selfish baby

CHARLIE

understand you But it’s hard
Youre different and maybe it’s
good that you’re different Maybe

but no words come out until she musters --

KATE
Thank you

Kate stands defeated and leaves the Principals office

Mr Davies takes Kate’s box of things from her

MR DAVIES

Kate throws her arms around Mr Davies and begins to --

-- full-on SOB

Mr Davies seems flustered and a little scared but tries to
comfort Kate

sits at the bar

The bartender gives Kate her drink Kate immediately downs
it

KATE (CONTD)
Can I have another one

BARTENDER
Sure -- you gotta pay for the first
one though Eight bucks

Kate puts a TWENTY DOLLAR BILL down
The bartender pours her another shot
LATER

Kate has clearly been drinking for awhile -- she’s curled up
at the bar nursing her BEER

BARTENDER (CONT’D)
Look Miss -- I don’t wanna be a
downer or anything ‘cause I take it
youve had a bad day but um I
think you need to go home

KATE
Why
BARTENDER
Cause you’re pretty drunk -- and

it’s four pm

Kate points to an old CRUSTY MAN at the other end of the bar

KATE (CONTD)
You’re not kicking him out

BARTENDER
I’m just trying to be a pal
KATE
Stop it -- you aren’t my pal I

I start fighting and stop fucking --
and sober I get fired Isn’t that

(beat)

some crack

BARTENDER
Lady you’re done

KATE
You think I’m above smoking crack
‘Cause I’m not And are you really
gonna tell me you’re not a little
attracted to me

Kate leans across the bar trying to look “seductive” -- but
she just looks like she might fall off her bar stool

BARTENDER
No

KATE
Just a teensy bit

BARTENDER
Not in the slightest

KATE
Wellyou might want to consider
investing in glasses buddy ‘Cause
I’m aa stone cold fox And I’m
smart And I’m

Kate begins to cry

KATE (CONTD)
«a good person

NO I’m not I’ve got friends
They’1l pick me up

BARTENDER
You do that

KATE

about me
The bartender takes a long look at Kate -- as though he’s

trying to size up if she’s insane

BARTENDER
Hope that works out for you

KATE
Can’t believe my luck I just want
to get drunk and a bartender won’t
let me
(beat)
Life is stupid

Kate stands up -- almost falling over -- and glares at the
bartender

KATE (CONTD)
You hear me Life is FUCKING
STUPID

Kate goes over to the old man at the end of bar winks at
him then picks up his drink and chugs it

Charlie calmly tries to move Kate off of him

CHARLIE

KATE

Charlie -- who’s creeped out now -- forcefully pushes Kate
off
CHARLIE

and begins picking up HOUSEHOLD OBJECTS and throwing them at
Charlie

KATE

shit on Fucked up family fired
from my job -- this marriage
Nothing’s wrong with me What’s

something and I can’t stay sober
because of you

CHARLIE
Youre blaming other people for
your problems
Kate picks the tequila bottle back up takes a sip then --
-- runs at Charlie and tackles him to the ground
CHARLIE (CONTD)
Stop it You’re acting like a
freak

Kate rips Charlie’s SHIRT --

-- and holds the bottle over his head while straddling him
as if she’s about to hit him with it

CHARLIE (CONTD)
No What’s wrong with you

Kate holds the bottle in the air and looks hard at Charlie
She begins to weep

KATE
I can’t be sober and be with you

Kate gets a flash of anger again and just as it seems like
she’s about to hit Charlie with the bottle she --

-- upturns the bottle and begins to chug the tequila

Charlie tries to yank the bottle away but Kate holds on
tight With the bottle at Kate’s lips -- and tequila pouring
down her chin -- the couple wrestles for control of the
bottle

off”

those slogans They all sound like
bumper stickers But I have to

big asshole Well unless you want
