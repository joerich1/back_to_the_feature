CHYRON -- ATLANTA 612 AM

EXT SOMEWHAT SEEDY TWO-STORY HOTEL IN ATLANTA -- PRE-DAWN

Its still more night than day as we look down on the HOTEL
ATLANTA The lit sign for the HOTEL ATLANTA may be the only
source of light as we hear a metallic rattle

EXT HOTEL ATLANTA -- SECOND FLOOR -- PRE-DAWN

We follow the metallic rattle to a door The rattling stops
and we watch the knob slowly turn

Tight on a feminine arm with a tattoo that announces hope
We pull back to find that both arms are employed in the
pulling of what looks like a large suitcase

NICOLE MAGGEN a beautiful but tired woman finishes pulling
the suitcase that we now surmise to be a folded-up massage
table out of the motel room With her bra in one hand and
the rickety table resting against the wall of the exterior
2nd floor hallway of the motel she assesses her situation

She digs in her purse lights a cigarette and continues
digging in her purse She finds a beat-up candy tin She
opens it and quickly sorts through a collection of burnt
foils heroin foils looking for residue Nothing

She now finds and holds up the 100 bucks she just made She
flips open her cheap phone and makes a callshe thinks
better of it and hangs up

EXT HOTEL ATLANTA -- PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER

NICOLE forces the clumsy table into the hatchback of a 1988
time

Toyota Tercel and slams it shut

INT 1988 TOYOTA TERCEL -- PARKING LOT -- SAME TIME

We hear the electronic ring of her cheap cell phone on
speaker phone mode The phone rests on the passenger seat
We pull up to find NICOLE slumped with her head resting on
the steering wheel She is exhausted and irritated

NICOLE
(as the phone rings)
Dont pick updont pick up
dont pick up

A MAN answers with music in the backgroundYo NICOLE
quickly picks up the phone

NICOLE (CONTD)
Its Nic do you have any Good
morning to you too Youre what
Well where are you guys shooting
today Where Text me the
address You have someOkay

She hangs up the phone and catching herself in the rearview
she tries to smile

CHYRON -- ORLANDO 714 AM

EXT AMERICAN VALUE SUITES - HOTEL -- ORLANDO -- MORNING

The sun would be rising if the sky wasnt swirling with grey
clouds We see the American Suites Hotel and recognize it as
a decent commuters hotel near the airport in Orlando The
sound of a clock radio breaks the calm of our picture

INT AMERICAN VALUE SUITES - HOTEL -- ORLANDO -- MORNING

Through the clock radio we loudly hear two morning drive-
radio personalities spewing nonsensical patter

An attractive YOUNG WOMAN wrestles free of the covers and
gets out of bed She crosses naked through the room as a

cell phone starts ringing

Back to the bed as WHIP WHITAKER rises into frame and
inhabits the room like a lazy ape at the zoo WHIP wears his

40 some years of life experience like a medal Smoke hangs
in the air and empty beers a pint of vodka and two empty
carafes of cheap hotel wine clutter the table as WHIP
snatches up his phone and answers

VOICE
For the love of Christ Lookjust
holdHOLD ON

He aggressively drains the last four inches of beer from a
clear bottle and cracks the last fresh one that bobs in the
hotel ice bucket

The naked YOUNG WOMAN bends over to pick up her clothes

We witness her ass as a tanned glass vase with a perfect
crack down the middle Whip smiles taking it all in

WHIP
(into the phone)
Ive been up since the crack a
dawn What check Tuition How
much does it cost to go there

The YOUNG WOMAN has re-lit the last half of a joint and is
puffing it to life as WHIP is beckoning with his large
hands

The YOUNG WOMAN looking more like a stripper by the second
hands the joint to WHIP who takes a masterful drag WHIP
shakes his head in violent disapproval to what he hears on
the phone He exhales in anger as he shouts into the phone

WHIP (CONTD)

NO NO NO You decided he needed
private schoollemme talk to
nuckles Hes not Tellem the
hone works both ways Oh hes my
on because you need a tuition
heckthats great Deana Im
lad you tracked me down in Orlando

ven like the fucking school No
ve never seen it Yeah I wonder
hy not too I gotta 9 oclock
light sit tight till I get back
o Atlanta How am I a liar

hat No Ill call you

StmheHonMQQA YWD

WHIP hangs up and continues to make quick work of the last
beer as he stares through his thoughts and out the window

YOUNG WOMAN
Was that your wife

WHIP
That was my ex-wife But you
Trina you could be my second or
third wife if youd just Cmere

The YOUNG WOMAN we now know as TRINA smiles seductively

TRINA
Whip dont even joke about that
Our flights at 9 lets hit it

TRINA is still naked but she holds a navy blue skirt and a
white blouse as she hands WHIP his pants WHIP cant help
but pat that perfect ass as TRINA tries to skip away

ON THE RADIO We hear the opening bars of a familiar rock
anthemJOE COCKERs Im Feeling Alright

WHIP
Yeah Im feelin a little light-
headed I shoulda ate somethin’

WHIP leans over the motel table picks up a soda straw
thats
been cut in half He efficiently sniffs up a line of coke

INT AMERICAN VALUE SUITES HOTEL-ORLANDO-HALLWAY-MORNING

WHIP wears his pilot Blues and carries his hat as he strides
confidently down the hallway JOE COCKER continues to wail
perfectly narrating the heros swagger that WHIP maintains
while passing bad light fixtures and ornate wall paper

EXT AIRPORT SOUTHJET TARMAC - AIRPLANE - MORNING RAINING

WHIP leans against the landing gear of the JACKSON-
RIDGEFIELD
88 PASSENGER JET -- He takes a swig from a small bottle of
mouthwash -- gargles then spits the green foam on the
tarmac WHIP wipes fatigue from his face as he stashes the
mouthwash in his pocket then quickly completes his visual
walk around He looks at the sky again as he steps on to the
jet way ladder His foot slips sending his shoe SPLASHING
in
to a puddle

WHIP
Son of a bitch

Whip shakes the rain out of his shoe as he continues up the
stairs

INT ORLANDO AIRPORT TERMINAL - JETWAY -- DAY

WHIP enters the jetway from the exterior door at the
entrance
of the plane TRINA is greeting a MAN and his SON

WHIP
Morning Miss Marquez

TRINA
Morning Captain Whitaker

WHIP waits as TRINA politely parts the stream of folks to
allow WHIP to enter the plane

INT AIRPLANE GALLEY -- MOMENTS LATER

WHIP exchanges a look with a MATURE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
MARGARET THOMASON She cant help but smile

MARGARET

WHIP

The girls laugh at the familiar exchange

takes a huge hit

the nose between the lights of the runway

Ridgefield JR-88 accelerates directly into a huge black
cloud He begins to dip the nose level to the ground

EVANS
Why are you leveling off sir

WHIP
Id like to spend less time in this
shitty air Kenny Is that alright

WHIP pushes the 17-year-old Jackson-Ridgefield JR-88

into a huge black cloud He begins to dip the nose towards

WHIP starts to hum the Joe Cocker song again as he cranes
his

head up close to the windscreen -- looking intently at the

dark sky

WHIP (CONTD)
Cmon sweetheart show me the sun

Suddenly we see a beam of light breaking through the black
clouds -- 12 oclock high A God ray

WHIP (contd) (CONTD)
Finally daylight

WHIP banks the plane hard lifting the nose -- pointing it
directly at the crack in the darkness He shoves the
throttles to full power

The plane is banking rising and accelerating

INT PASSENGER CABIN - DAY
The screaming passengers go quiet with the strange new
development The shaking has eased from a 10 to a 5

INT COCKPIT - DAY
Whip keeps the plane climbing steeply The Vertical Speed
Indicator shows were ascending 2000 feet per minute The
altimeter spins up past 12000 ft

The murky grey outside becomes lighter and brighter until
suddenly in a dramatic reveal

WE BREAK THROUGH THE CLOUDS
Instantly the air becomes perfectly smooth

Whip levels off and maneuvers between the two towering cloud
walls -- smooth as silk

Gliding over the fluffy white clouds and through the
shimmering rays of the sun -- it feels like WHIP just flew

the JR-88 into heaven

A joyous CHEER ERUPTS from the passenger cabin

WHIP pulls the power back and switches on the auto-pilot
EVANS is cheery almost giddy

EVANS
Glad thats over

WHIP however is very shaky and beaded with sweat

on yet another candy tin that springs open NICOLE fixes her
stare at the hypodermic needle resting inside

INT CABIN - GALLEY - DAY

WHIP exits the lavatory drying his hands with a towel He
looks down the aisle to see TRINA far down the cabin TRINA
sees WHIP comes back up the aisle and stands with her back
to him watching the passengers

WHIP opens a bottle of orange juice and takes a big swig He
then pours half of it in the sink WHIP places the open
juice bottle on the liquor cart reaches up and grabs the
cabin mic to address the passengers

WHIP
Folks this is Captain Whitaker
If you look up Im here in the
galley I will wave to you

WHIP steps into the aisle so the passengers can see him
WHIP waves with a calm smile that would put anyone at ease

WHIP (CONTD)
Good Morning I apologize for the
bumps but Florida just doesnt
seem to like us Georgians Must be
the beatin the Bulldogs put on the
Gators last fall

Titters of laughter from the passengers as WHIP moves the
half step he needs to put himself behind the liquor cart

WHIP (CONTD)
Stretch out and relax The air
might stay a little cranky so Im
gonna ask that you sit tight if you
can with your seat belts fastened

We now watch from behind WHIP as his free hand reaches into

the top drawer of the liquor cart and pulls three small
vodka

bottles out

WHIP (CONTD)
We wont have beverage service but
the girls will walk through with
water and snacks and Ill have you
in Atlanta in about 40 minutes
Thank you

WHIP puts the mic to its hook Alone in the galley and out
of view he quickly empties the vodkas into the orange juice
bottle and replaces the cap Whip shakes the juice as he
whos

she

of

tosses the little empties into the galley trash Whip takes
a healthy pull from the spiked juice downing nearly half

WHIP knocks on the cockpit door MARGARET emerges and WHIP
disappears in to the cockpit
INT NICOLES APARTMENT -- ATLANTA -- DAY

Framed photos on a bureau show Christmas around the tree
with Mom and Dad and a girl whos 8 and a boy

heroin in a spoon)

Another photo depicts an 8 year-old girls birthday party
(In the reflection of this photo see wee Nicole tying off)

A last photo shows NICOLE and her mom They are
both wearing kerchiefs We can see that her mom is gaunt and
has no hair under her kerchief (In the reflection of this
photo we see the needle injected into her arm)

A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE is placed in front of that picture Next
to the photos is a small CD station that NICOLE taps to life
and turns up The opening bars of Michael Fitzpatricks
Medication begin to play

We pull wide to see NICOLE pull the bra from her arm that
used to tie off with Her face is pure happiness
Clothes and a peach crate filled with camera equipment join

suitcase on its side that acts as a coffee table NICOLE
picks up her camera and admires it before putting it down

She picks up the cigarette she had staged pre dope fix and
reaches for the lighter She laughs and hums pulls out gum
a brushShes holding the brush when the first heavy wave
of narcotic death washes over her She leans back and uses
the wall for support Medication is hitting its chorus

NICOLE
Oh man

She puts her arms out at her sides euphoria A slow sloppy
smile breaks across her face She exhales slowly She

reaches for the now burning cigarette when the second wave

heavy drugs hits NICOLE looks up with fear
sinks

NICOLE (contd) (CONTD)
Oh no oh no oh no

She reaches for the little bag of coke that KIP gave her
Next she grabs her phone flipping it open As she tries to
dial it she crumbles to her knees NICOLE somewhat controls
her fall to the ground but her eyes are fading The little
bag of coke falls from her fingers

Theres no way to stem the tide of the oncoming overdose
NICOLEs arms stretch out in a frozen reach as her body

to the floor On her back like a girl making angels in the
snow as her eyelids flutter she slips away

INT COCKPIT - DAY

WHIP is now passed out in the seat next to EVANS He has two
approach plates (charts) folded and tucked between his
sunglasses and eyes creating a makeshift sleeping mask His
lower jaw hangs open as his head bobs in deep sleep

Margaret leans in through the cockpit door talking to Evans

MARGARET

EVANS maintains a military posture as he monitors the
progress The flight is smooth and the sky appears clear
EVANS

BANG THE PLANE SUDDENLY PITCHES SIDEWAYS
Instantly the autopilots Shut-Off SOUNDS
WHIP jolts awake and pushes up his sleeping shades

Evans quickly throws the EMRG FUEL DUMP switch

The airplane bucks and drops violently -- A chorus of
terrified SCREAMS ERUPTS from the main cabin

Whip pulls on his yoke with all of his strength and the dive
shallows out a bit

nod

WHIP (CONTD)

Whip releases back pressure from his yoke pushing it

forward
-- the plane noses downward 20 degrees
WHIP (CONTD)

MORE TERRIFIED SHRIEKS come from the back Margaret quickly
disengages then re-engages the large red handle
Whip pulls back on his yoke The plane pitches up
WHIP (CONTD)

some power
Evans pushes up the throttles Whip gingerly applies
pressure

to his stick His face fills with worry
WHIP (CONTD)
I dont know It feels like the son
of a bitch wants to nose over

Then suddenly WHAP Whips yoke flies out of his hands
and
SLAMS forward

The plane banks right and drops Margaret SCREAMS

WHIP (CONTD)

attitude and speed

WHIP pushes both of his feet forward stretching his body to
get leverage as we can see him pulling on the yoke trying
to
get the plane out of the dive its in
Evans is starting to lose it

EVANS
Oh Lord were descending at 4700

EVANS
Oh Lord Jesus Were inverted

WHIP reaches over and pulls the throttles back He suddenly
seems strangely calm comfortable with his fate

WHIP
Were level We can maintain
altitude like this

MAIN CABIN -- WE WATCH OVER TRINAS SHOULDER AS SHE HANGS
TRINA struggles to stay in her seat as she looks at the
passengers hanging She watches as a YOUNG BOY loses his
grip and flops to the ground

TRINA unhooks and flops to the ground We follow her as she
runs on the ceiling of the cabin towards the BOY She gets
there and starts lifting him towards his FATHER

of a TV with no sound

TELEVISION -- NEWS - NO SOUND -- GRAINY CELL PHONE FOOTAGE

A news show runs a loop of eye witness cell phone footage of
the plane turning over and crashing belly down

A MAN who has been watching the TV turns to see that WHIP is
awake The MAN turns off the TV gets up and approaches
WHIPs bedside WHIP knows him

WHIP
Charlie Anderson

CHARLIE ANDERSON is a late 50s former military pilot who
carries that familiar air of Texas comfort and entitlement

CHARLIE
How you feelin Whip Initial
reports look like you pulled some
move up there kid You saved a
lot of lives

WHIP is moved by the first realization of survival

WHIP
How many

CHARLIE moves close to deliver the news

CHARLIE
102 souls on board including the
flight crew and 96 of them
survived the crash Six people
died 2 crew 4 passengers
WHIP
4 passengers Are the rest badly
hurt Whod we lose on the crew

A NURSE enters the room CHARLIE nods to her

CHARLIE
Listen protocol is the NTSB has to
make the first contact with you and
the agent is here Let me go get
him

CHARLIE ducks out of the room WHIP is alone and still
getting his bearings He goes to scratch his head and
catches sight of his left hand Its swollen and sore --his
wrist is bandaged with a splint-brace He now looks at both
of his hands in wonder

WHIP hears a muffled conversation that gets clearer as do
the

images of MANY PEOPLE entering the room A POLICE OFFICER

accompanies a DOCTOR and TWO NTSB AGENTS

An NTSB AGENT holds a small voice recorder towards WHIP

NTSB OFFICER 1
Captain William Whitaker Nod if
you can hear me and understand me

(WHIP NODS)
Im Craig Matson from the NTSB and
Im required as the lead on the Go
Team to make an initial contact
with you after a major incident
like the one you had today

WHIP nods as his senses are getting sharper

NTSB OFFICER 1 (CONTD)
You are in a hospital in South
Atlanta Are you aware that you
were piloting a plane that went
down

(WHIP NODS)
I have a doctor here who can
explain your medical situation

WHIP offers a thumbs up gesture The DOCTOR steps in
DOCTOR

Im Doctor Kenan and the good news
is that you are in good condition
You did suffer a concussion which
is the reason you have a bit of
blurred vision and a headache You
have numerous lacerations around
your left eye Were going to leave
the patch on for a few days as a
precaution But it seems your eye
is OK MRIs show strained tendons
in your left knee and ankle but you
didnt break any bones

You have some deep bruising in your
left thigh and you have a few torn
ligaments in your left wrist
Nothing serious So as soon as we
clear you from the concussion and
you feel well enough -- you can go
home That could be a day could

be 3 days Okay

WHIP quietly nods The DOCTOR leaves and WHIP begins to
study his body His left leg is wrapped his left wrist has
a splint-brace --

NTSB OFFICER 1
I wont ask too much of you
tonight but as I said the NTSB is
required to make initial contact
How much do you remember about the
flight

WHIP looks at the NTSB OFFICER and slowly speaks

WHIP
I remember everything until the
crash

WHIPs voice is failing him as his throat is sore and dry

NTSB OFFICER 1
Okay Mr Whitaker thats fine I
am required to inform you that this
incident did result in the loss of
life
(checks an index card)
The most current information states
that of the 102 souls on board we
lost 6 2 crew members and 4
passengers 59 people were treated
and released 37 people remain in
the hospital and 3 of those cases
are listed as critical

WHIP
Who on the crew died

NTSB OFFICER 1
Two flight attendants
(checks a note card)
Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez

WHIP tries to exhale as the loss of TRINA sinks in

NTSB OFFCIER 1
The rep from your Pilots Union
Mr Anderson will act as our
contact for you Its important to
follow your Unions guidance on
press and media The pilots union
works closely with the NTSB So
Im gonna head out Good luck Mr
Whitaker

WHIP nods as the NTSB OFFICER leaves with the police and
other officials in tow CHARLIE returns to WHIPs side

WHIP
I knew Trina Marquez We spent
some time together

CHARLIE

Apparently she wasnt strapped in
A survivor reported that she was
assisting a kid

CHARLIE tries to put a reassuring hand on WHIPs shoulder

WHIP

Broken collar bone cuts banged
up but shes okay Shes here

bad shot to the head Theyre

WHIP starts to weep as he needs to begin the long process of
expressing this trauma

CHARLIE

WHIP nods as he wipes his eyes on his heavily bandaged hand

CHARLIE (CONTD)

gratitude to the brave men and
women on the flight crew

WHIPs pain meds He fishes out the two pills and stares at

HARLING casually tosses the pills down his gullet and
expertly swallows them without water He grabs WHIPs

HARLING puts his hand on WHIPs forehead in an attempt to
reassure him A quiet moment before HARLING slips out

INT HOSPITAL ROOM -- 11 PM -- SAME EVENING

WHIP wakes up in a cold sweat He is breathing heavy as he
scans the room LIGHTENING FLASHES from outside the window
Thunder RUMBLES

WHIP looks to the night stand where we see a pack of

gum has been chewed through WHIP uses his hands to get to
the edge of the bed He roots through the duffle bag that
HARLING left and finds a pack of smokes and a Bic lighter
still in its package

Determined to smoke WHIP eyes a WHEEL CHAIR that has been
placed next to his bed Leaning against the wheelchair is a
medical cane

INT HOSPITAL -- QUIET HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

Wearing his Happi Coat (or robe) WHIP limps in to the empty
hallway with the use of his cane He checks the quiet

corridor as he begins his quest

INT HOSPITAL -- FIRE DOOR -- 1138 PM

The door swings open and no one appears to be on the other
side Now WHIP fights to push the heavy door open again to
slip through A hand grabs the door and holds it WHIP
walks into the sanctity of the stairwell

INT HOSPITAL STAIRWELL -- SAME TIME

We find the owner of the helping hand was NICOLE who returns
to a quiet spot along the wall of the stairwell as she
demurely smokes a cigarette
WHIP
Thank you

WHIP leans his cane against the wall and carefully pulls a
pack of smokes from his pocket

WHIP (CONTD)
I didnt think anyone would have
the same devious thought about
using the fire stairs to have a
smoke

NICOLE smiles and looks down awkward around men when she is
not loaded She drops her cigarette which we see was barely
smoked as she maneuvers to leave

WHIP (CONTD)
Dont go Ill be quiet

He offers her a cigarette she takes it
WHIP (CONTD)
We dont have to talk Be nice to

just smoke with someone

And they do They sit in silence as the stairwell fills up
with smoke After a long beat

NICOLE
Were you on the plane

WHIP studies her shes beautiful in an exhausted way

WHIP
Yeah I was Were you

Nicole shakes her head

NICOLE
Where were you sitting

WHIP

Up near the front

Again it falls silent as we let them smoke and think in the
sanctity of the fire stairs

A VOICE breaks their silence

VOICE (0S)
which

Tobaccos but an Indian weed
Grows green in the morn cut down
at eve It shows our decay We are
but clayI love the smell of
Nicotina in the morning Smells
likevictory

We hear a metallic rattle and WHIP and NICOLE look to the
stairs

VOICE (CONTD)
Dont flee dear comrades Really
wait for me please

A GAUNT YOUNG MAN makes his way to their landing He is
dressed in a hospital gown and carrying an IV pole on

hangs a small bag of clear liquid The mans hair has
completely left him His skin is gray Eyes hollowed from
his battle with cancer

GAUNT YOUNG MAN
Can I bum a smoke

WHIP offers him a cigarette He takes it and fires it up
with a lighter he keeps stowed in the pocket of his gown

GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONTD)
I should quit my cancer might get
cancer

NICOLE

WHIP looks at the ground as the GAUNT YOUNG MAN studies him

GAUNT YOUNG MAN

GAUNT YOUNG MAN laughs

WHIP

GAUNT YOUNG MAN

fucker if you dont believe in God

The GOD topic has silenced the stairwell

GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONTD)

As soon as you realize that the
random events in your life are
Godyou will live a much better
life You spend your life
believing that you have all the
control over what happens
Bullshit The plane youre flying
goes down Out of your control
God gives you cancer I have no
control over that Did God give me
cancer You bet your ass God gave
me cancer You think if I begged
for cancer God would have given it
to me

Nobecause I assure you I have
begged for God to take it away -
and guess what I have no control
over that
GAUNT YOUNG MAN smokes the cig to the nub and rubs
remains against the smooth concrete wall

GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONTD)

Can I get another smoke Whats
wrong with you honey Youre
beautiful do you know that Do I
scare you People either have to
pretend they dont see me or
theyre drawn to me Its funny
because people see me as being
close to the other side -- they
feel like I have power or wisdom
They think I have the answers Who
knows Maybe I do Death gives

you perspective I lived my life
so indecisive in a haze But now
that Im dying everything is so
clear It all makes sense somehow
Im sorry but I cant get over how
beautiful you are Look at your
arm you an addict

NICOLE looks at him She nods

GAUNT YOUNG MAN (CONTD)

The GAUNT YOUNG MAN leaves clanging away with his IV

NICOLE wipes away her tears we see her hospital bracelet as
well as her track marks

NICOLE steps on her cigarette and puts the nub in her
pocket

She begins to leave WHIP stops her

NICOLE laughs

to the crash site immediately

WHIP
They find the flight data

HUGH
An initial report shows alcohol in
your bloodstream at a level of 24
In the US

driving countries in the world --

number over 08 And by driving I
mean a car

They all digest the information as the WAITRESS delivers the
cinnamon rolls She leaves Its still quiet

WHIP

the night before I flew And
whatThat made the tail of the
plane explode

CHARLIE

EXT CRASH SITE -- DAY
A REPORTER gives a lead in at the crash site

CRASH SITE REPORTER 1

Kevin its still chaotic here at
the site Apparently a small
ministry was conducting services
near to where the plane came down
So the scene here is a mix of
survivors and first responders I
was able to catch up with an actual
passenger moments ago

A YOUNG SHORT HAIRED BLONDE MAN GIVES HIS ACCOUNT

PASSENGER 1
We were in a nose dive and people
were screaming and yelling and then
the plane turned upside down and we
had to hold on to our seat belts to
keep from falling out of our chairs
-- I saw one kid fall to the floor
and this flight attendant picked
him up and handed him to his
dadI didnt see her again

CRASH SITE REPORTER 1

More details and more reports of
the casualties are continuing to
fly around I can tell you that
there appears to be many many
survivors Thats all I have for
now Kevin

Another reporter has a passengers account

CRASH SITE REPORTER 2
Rebecca surviving passengers are
being put in ambulances police
cruisers and even first responder
vehicles and they are being taken
to local hospitals for treatment
Some of the injured appear serious
and its safe to assume at this
point that there are at least a few
fatalities Lets roll the tape of

over massaging his leg WHIP exhales

WHIP (CONTD)

NICOLE
Its throbbing because the blood is
having a hard time getting back to

dressed

EXT CRASH SITE -- OBSERVATION SCAFFOLDING -- DAY

WHIP joins HUGH on a rectangular platform on top of a two-
story scaffolding frame The platform provides a perfect
view of flight 227s final resting area We see the awesome

devastation that 50 tons of metal flying at 140 miles an
hour

can do to a hillside

HUGH
You can see the initial impact
sheared the right wing clean off
If only the left wing had come off
at impact I think everyone would
have walked off that plane

WHIP
The left wing partially pulled away-

HUGH
It snapped but stayed connected to
the airframe So it whipped back
towards the plane hit the fuselage
in front of the tail If you were
sitting in the last 6 or 7 rows on
the left side it was like being
hit by a train

WHIP
I drank a lot the night before that
flight I drank that morning too
and I used coke to straighten up

HUGH
I know its in the toxicology
report
WHIP
But thats not the reason this
happened
HUGH
I know
WHIP looks at HUGH expecting him to finish his thought HUGH

holds his look for a beat before changing thoughts

HUGH (CONTD)
The John the Baptist Pentecostal
Mission

We hear voices a low murmur that gets louder chanting
WHIP looks to the top of the hill to see

PENTECOSTAL MASS IN PROGRESS

A MINISTER in a dark purple cloak calls from the new
testament as the CONGREGATION responds in unison

MINISTER
He will wipe away every tear from
their eyes and death shall be no
more neither shall there be
mourning nor crying nor pain
anymore for the former things have
passed away -- Revelation 214

There are at least 50 people sitting in white folding chairs
at the foot of the hill A small brook babbles behind them

WHIP continues to take in the bizarre scene

HUGH
They helped pull survivors out of
the wreckage Now they come out
here every day and have a mass 30
minutes prior to the crash And
then they sit in silent prayer for
10 minutes at 942which is when
you went down

WHIP is overwhelmed by the magnitude of the crash field and
the WORSHIPPERS WHIP looks back at the crash site to see

NTSB INVESTIGATORS

Inside the crash site a small group of INVESTIGATORS with
NTSB jackets following the lead of a CONFIDENT WOMAN HUGH
answers the question in WHIPs mind

HUGH (CONTD)
Ellen Block shes the head of the
investigation for the NTSB Shes
the one thats gonna ask the tough
questions

WHIP
Whyd you bring me here

HUGH
I needed you to see this

WHIP
You trying to scare me
HUGH
I need to know that you can handle
all this

WHIP continues to stare at the awesome dent in the earth

HUGH (CONTD)
Listen clearly There was a
mechanical issue with the plane
but what you and I know Is that
this was an act of God Im gonna
fight to get the NTSB to place act
of God on the probable causes
list

WHIP
Whos God would do this

Its quiet before HUGH makes his case

HUGH
So heres the deal Avington Carr

sideand hes got big friends in
Washington He wants to sit down

INT CARRS OFFICE - ATLANTA BASEBALL STADIUM -- DAY

A huge office with a glass wall that looks out over the
diamond We are high above the outfield if GOD was a
baseball fan this would be his office We now meet AVINGTON
CARR a very righteous and self-satisfied wealthy southern
gentlemen

MR CARR

I never wanted that fuckin
airline Neither did my brother

CARR scans the room reading faces holding court

MR CARR (CONTD)
It was my father that wanted it I
like baseball

Ornate wood furniture helps to announce the political feel
of MR CARRs world Presidential photos and commendations
pepper the walls Its quiet

HUGH LANG
I like baseball

Everyone looks to HUGH as it gets oddly silent We get our
first look at LEN CALDWELL the president of the pilots
union LEN tries to wrest some control and exude some
confidence

LEN CALDWELL
Everyone in Georgia likes baseball

MR CARR

Yeahso whats the deal Lenny

Is your union gonna survive this

one More importantly How big a

check you think Im gonna have to
write

LEN CALDWELL
There were 6 fatalities on the
PLANE-

HUGH LANG

The 2 crew members dont get
settlements like the passengers
Thats a workmans comp claim part
of the union contract -- they do a
dangerous job and they know it

MR CARR
Youre the lawyer for the pilots
union

LEN CALDWELL
No this is Hugh Lang the attorney
we brought in to handle the
criminal side of Captain Whitakers
situation

MR CARR

Yes and what is Mr Whitakers
situation NTSB is up my ass with
a flashlight We had to give them
access to everything

(shakes his head)
And everyone is curious about
Captain Whitaker

Through a glass wall we see
WHIP SITS ON A COUCH READING A MAGAZINE IN A RECEPTION AREA

CHARLIE
I flew with him Hes a great
pilot

MR CARR
Is he a drunk

CHARLIE
Hes a heavy drinker Should I
bring him in

Everyone steals glances at WHIP as CARR continues to
dominate

MR CARR

In a minute Alright so lets get
down to it Lenny What does the
union plan to do about this blood
test that says Whitaker was high on
booze and coke This guys a real

peach

HUGH
Im gonna kill the toxicology
report

(feels eyes of disbelief)

It was done incompetently The

last time the toxicology equipment
they used was calibrated was in
June of 2009 which is 18 months
past code Their log that should
clearly state who labeled the blood
vials and when is very incomplete
And they arent sure who stored
them They used a preservative in
the vials that has in some cases
caused blood to ferment and
register higher in an alcohol test
Thats what Ive done so far I

can handle this

MR CARR

I like this guy Lenny He makes me
wanna go out and sniff a few lines
and fly a jet

LEN CALDWELL
Mr Carr were gonna fight to push
all the fault on Jackson
Ridgefield the manufacturer

MR CARR

Oh and you think theyre gonna just
open their check book and buy us
all lunch Good fucking luck
Whats my exposure Jim

CARRS BUSINESS GUY
The awards to the families could
kill the airline

MR CARR

Fuck the airline The insurance
companies can have the goddamm
airline I just dont want them to
come sniffing in my other pockets

LEN CALDWELL
Speaking for the pilots union We
dont want your airline to go away
We enjoy your contract with us and
we will protect Captain Whitaker
and in turn protect your airline

MR CARR

Thats sweet Mr Caldwell but if
the NTSB leaks that toxicology
report showing my pilot was flying
that plane drunk Were all
fucked

CHARLIE
So far weve been lucky
MR CARR

Lucky Are you that goddammed
dumb You think theyre waiting
for a light news day to splash the
headline Drunk coke-addled pilot
crashes a plane

EVERYONE goes quiet as CARRs anger commands silence

MR CARR (CONTD)

My brothers in DC on his knees at
the foot of the throne begging for
forgiveness And so far its
working

Theyve got their boot on the neck
of this girl Ellen Block runnin
the show for the NTSB and she is
pissed Can you handle that

HUGH cant stifle a laugh They look to him

HUGH LANG
Trust me Im gonna kill the
toxicology report Thats my job

CARR looks to his lawyer who nods

CARRS ATTORNEY
I wish you luck but were still
sorting out the best way to go
forward legally We might split
from you and go it alone

CARR stands to signal the end of the meeting HUGH stands to
stop him

HUGH LANG
To go it alone Without us That
would be what the French call a
big fucking mistake

MR CARR
Does Whitaker know hes going to
jail

HUGH LANG
I havent had a client go to jail
yet
his

MR CARR

Hes going to jail He belongs in
jail You bet your ass hes going
to jail the question isis he
gonna die in jail

HUGH LANG
Youre wrong Mr Carr

manslaughter is life in prison

itself out in slow tragic fashion WHIP motions to his

as if he is smoking He freezes and then steps forward and
trips in to the coffee table Whip falls to the ground

NICOLE checks WHIPs face to see his eyes partially opened
but passed out NICOLE goes to the bedroom and returns with
a blanket that she covers WHIP with She also places a
pillow under his head making sure that his head is titled

bottles and straighten up

candor of the speaker as she joins the room in laughter

BARRY makes eye contact with a STERN LOOKING OLD TIMER
BARRY holds up a loose leaf binder and addresses the man

AA SPEAKER 1 (CONTD)

Dont worry Ed I got the format

me the stink eye Let me get back
to the format

(reads from the format)

Im Barry Im an alcoholic

THE ASSEMBLY
(IN UNISON)
Hi Barry

AA SPEAKER 1
Are there any other alcoholics
present

WHIP glances around to find himself in a sea of raised-
handed
alcoholics A few look at WHIP with no judgement

AA SPEAKER 1 (CONTD)

I like meetings that have us all
identify Because it makes me tell
the truth about who I am It
reminds that I never ever told the
truth I lied about everything
My whole life had been a lie And
I was told that I would never get
sober if I kept lying

WHIP is very reserved poker-faced

AA SPEAKER 1

I mean lyings what Im good at
If I know anything in this life
its how to lie especially about
my drinking

We pan the faces and everyone seems immediately connected
Except WHIP who leans over to NICOLE

WHIP
I gotta go Okay

(NICOLE NODS)
Can uh
(points to Sheila)

NICOLE
Yeah Sheila She can take me back
to work
SHEILA
(extends her hand)
Im Sheila

WHIP shakes her hand before quickly escaping as if from a
fire We stay close on WHIPs face as he walks out BARRY
continues his pitch

AA SPEAKER 1

Like I said I would lie about
everything It didnt matter what
it was My whole life had been a
lie A series of lies strung
together by me And when I drank
t was worse What I came to
understand was that my lies were
illing me And that remains the
great fact for meMy lies will
ill me

apart

EVANS
I remember everything until we
crashed I know what went on

WHIP
What are we talking about

EVANS
I dont know Captain Whitaker what
are we talking about

WHIP
I just wanted to get a sense from
you what you thought caused the
crash

EVANS
Was it the fact that you got on the
plane drunk from the night before

WHIP goes white and drops his head

EVANS (CONTD)
The NTSB is coming back tomorrow to
finish taking a deposition from me
about the events on the flight

WHIP
You think youd be alive without me
on that plane

The flight was pre-ordained Ive
prayed on it Captain Vicki and I
have prayed on it Theres only
one judge --

VICKI EVANS

Praise Jesus

EVANS
And he has a higher plan for you

its loss of life is also a
celebration of life
EVANS begins to mist up with sincere inspiration

EVANS (CONTD)
Nothing happens in the Kingdom of
the Lord by mistake

VICKI EVANS
Praise Jesus

EVANS
Captain will you pray with me

WHIP stares into EVANS eyes and sees a believers
conviction EVANS reaches out his hand to WHIP

WHIP slowly moves out of his chair and kneels at the side of
EVANS bed WHIP takes EVANS hand and bows his head as he
reaches for VICKIs at the same time Its quiet before

he holds her tighter and tighter

INT WHITAKER FARM -- KITCHEN -- EARLY MORNING

NICOLE is dressed and sitting at the kitchen table Past
NICOLE we can see WHIP lying in bed

She has all her possessions in a crate and a duffel bag at

her feet She finishes a handwritten note and places it
down NICOLE picks up the note and begins to reread it

She hears a car in the driveway -- she picks up her stuff
and

takes one last look at the sleeping WHIP She leaves

careful not to make a sound

EXT WHITAKER FARM -- FRONT DOOR -- EARLY MORNING

NICOLE quietly exits the house carrying a crate of her
stuff She has a duffel bag of clothes over her shoulder as
she makes her way to SHEILAs car that we see parked at the
beer

top of the driveway far from the house

INT WHITAKER RANCH -- BEDROOM -- LATER SAME DAY

WHIP stirs wakes up and looks around WHIP walks around
looking for NICOLE He finds the note and reads it The

reality of her disappearance sets in
window and stares out at the barn

and he moves to the

WHIP returns his look inside the house and he sees the big
book of AA on the table near where the letter was left WHIP

picks it up and throws it across the

room He then grabs the

back of a chair and tosses it against the wall

After wiping photos off of the wall he picks up an empty

bottle and fires the bottle at a shelf on the opposite wall
The bottle explodes and WHIP stops as he realizes he came
within an inch of shattering a framed photo of he and his

son

We hear the antiquated ring of the OLD HOUSE PHONE WHIP

relaxes his shoulders as the ringing

Whip is now drawing heavy breaths as
answered by the old machine

WHIPS FATHERS VOICE

Youve reached the Whitaker Crop
Dusting Company flying lessons and
plane rides Please leave a message

The beep concludes

CHARLIE
(speaking to voice mail)
Hey Whip if youre there

WHIP snatches the phone of the hook

WHIP

the ringing phone is

EXT NTSB HANGAR -- RAINING -- DAY

WHIP sits in his car Rain pounds the windshield as we
him expertly add vodka to a half-full bottle of orange
WHIP gives the bottle a shake before taking a long drink

WHIP takes another drink before re-capping the bottle and
stowing it in the glove box WHIP gets out and we watch him
walk in the rain towards the door of the hangar A SECURITY
GUARD meets him and takes him inside

INT NTSB HANGAR -- THE REMAINS OF FLIGHT 227 - DAY

WHIP is now alone in the huge brightly lit hangar He sees
the plane

The JR-88 has all of its pieces laying as close together as
possible Like the skeleton of a T-Rex in a museum The
sight is awesome breathtaking WHIP walks closer to the
twisted wreck and stops WHIP is overwhelmed by the sight
and as he is about to leave

CHARLIE steps out of the passenger door and calls down to
WHIP

CHARLIE
Heres our guy Cmon

WHIP walks towards a ramp that leads up to the hole in the
plane where the door used to be CHARLIE stands at the top
of the ramp Suddenly HUGH steps out of the plane

HUGH
Captain Whitaker weve won

WHIP doesnt move as HUGH starts down the ramp

HUGH (CONTD)
This is what we call in my
profession a walk over

CHARLIE
Theyve scheduled the hearing Its
in 10 days

CHARLIE and HUGH reach the bottom of the ramp

HUGH
But these hearings can be tough
You just need to stay sharp and on
course and answer the questions
correctly Its no longer a
question of your condition but the
condition of the plane

This picks directly at the scab of WHIPs guilt

HUGH (CONTD)
Ive had an Act of God
successfully added to the list of
probable causes

WHIP
Look its simple I flew a broken
plane

CHARLIE

You got it Thats right

WHIP
And what about my toxicology
report

HUGH

(trying to stay calm)

I killed it They have no physical
proof that you were intoxicated on
that plane And no eye witness
claims But theres a problem

This stops WHIP cold

HUGH (CONTD)
Because of the turbulence at the
beginning of the flight and then
the crash there was never any
drink service on the flight But
they found two little vodka bottles
in the galley trash bin There was
no physical evidence found on the
bottles no DNA no finger prints
But both the bottles were uncapped
and empty The only people who had
access to those bottles and could
have drank them were the flight
crew Margaret Evans and Camelia
Satou all had clean tox reports
That leaves you and Trina Marquez
to

They let that land WHIP nods

WHIP
Okay I seewhere this is going
Thats funny that they found two

bottles
HUGH
Why
WHIP
Because I drank three Ones
missing

HUGH explodes in frustration

HUGH LANG
When I met you I couldnt believe
what a flip drunk arrogant
scumbag you were

WHIP
Fuck you too Hugh

HUGH LANG
But I did the research and heard
the analysis from the experts Im
in awe of what you did

WHIP
Can I go now

HUGH gets big as he has to add the final piece of credence
the coronation

HUGH LANG
THE NTSB AND THE FAA TOOK 10
EXPERIENCED PILOTS AND PLACED THEM
IN SIMULATORS THEY RECREATED ALL
OF THE EVENTS THAT LED TO THIS
PLANE FALLING OUT OF THE SKY

HUGH is so loud and emotional even WHIP lends focus

HUGH LANG (CONTD)
Do you know how many were able to
safely land these broken planes

Everyone waits for the response as HUGH acknowledges the
debris around them
HUGH LANG (CONTD)
Not one Every pilot crashed and

killed everyone on board

WHIP
Yeah So

HUGH
You have no capacity to accept the
responsibility for the miracle you
performed and the lives you saved

WHIP
Great Im going home

WHIP pulls out his cigarettes and frees a smoke from the
pack

HUGH LANG
Do you want to go to prison Im
trying to save your life

CHARLIE steps between them as this exchange spirals

WHIP
What fucking life Dont kill
yourself on my account Hugh

WHIP starts to walk away

HUGH

WHIP wears boxers and a tee shirt with a towel around his
neck He looks to the clock -- 207

WE WATCH HIS SUIT BE PULLED FROM THE WARDROBE BAG

WHIP lays the suit out neatly on the couch separating the
shirt which he hangs from a light fixture to relax any
creases

WHIPS ROOM -- LATER YET AGAIN

The room is dark A soft wind RATTLES the window sash
WHIP lies on the bed He sighs sleep is alluding him and
the anxiety of tomorrows events on no sleep has his head
spinning He hears a metallic click He stays quiet to
listen for itthere it is again An annoying click
The clock reads 343--

He sits up and switches on the LIGHT He rubs his eyes and
goes to the table and sees the file folder laying there As
he is about to pick it up he hears the metallic click again
He goes to investigate

HOTEL ROOM CONNECTING DOOR -- SAME TIME

The connecting door is unlocked WHIP arrives and waits He
now watches as the connecting lock-bolt CLICKS against the
frame -- the door swinging in a draft He looks up to see
the culprit -- a heating vent WHIP flips the vent closed

Whip now pushes the door with his finger opening it a few
inches Nothing Darkness

WHIP
Hello Anyone

Whip enters

INT CONNECTING HOTEL ROOM -- SAME

The room is vacant The bed is made The drapes are pulled
open

WHIP walks quietly on the carpet towards the window The
night is clear Quiet Whip takes in the city lights

WHIPS POV --

Among the glass and steel office buildings Whip spots a
church spire A simple cross is perched on top

Whip looks at the church deep in thought

Then suddenly

We HEAR A HUM THE GENTLE HUM OF AN ELECTRIC MOTOR
WHIP turns from the window and scans the room

Its the MINI-BAR refrigerator -- HUMMING to life

Whip stares at the gleaming black box The WHIR of the motor
seems to get LOUDER Calling Whip Beckoning him
us

twists

Whip looks at the fridge His face is blank His eyes tell
nothing Then

Whip steps toward the box

CLOSE ON THE MINI-BAR Whip swings open the door

WHOOSH -- OUR DARK SCREEN LIGHTS

COLORS SPARKLE as a cadre of tiny liquor bottles GLOW like
jewels in a chest

WHIP stares at the glimmering gems for a long long time -

vodka gin wine bourbon The bottles SHIMMER -- AMBER
CRYSTAL EMERALD RUBY

WHIP reaches for a frosted vodka mini bottle -- he gently
pinches the neck of the bottle and lifts it out of the

fridge He holds up the mini vodka and considers it

Now Whip slowly removes the stopper and smells the White
Whiskey He looks at the bottle once more then slowly

the tiny cap back on

With a look of solemn resignation Whip places the frosted
mini bottle on top of the fridge and walks away

WE STAY CLOSE ON THE BOTTLE The CAMERA FOCUSES on the small
bottle as a small droplet of condensation runs down its side

-- ever so slowly slowly Then suddenly

WHAP In a flash WHIP SCOOPS THE VODKA OUT OF FRAME

INT THE ST JEROME HOTEL - ELEVATOR DOORS - MORNING

The ELEVATOR DOORS open and HUGH and CHARLIE step out and
head down the hallway

We follow our guys as they approach WHIPs room finding
OFFICER EDMONDS exactly where we left him -- in front of
WHIPs door

EXT THE ST JEROME HOTEL - HALLWAY - WHIPS DOOR - DAY

OFFICER EDMONDS stands up as CHARLIE and HUGH approach

CHARLIE

OFFICER EDMONDS

CHARLIE knocks on the door and checks his watch as he waits
for WHIP to answer CHARLIE cocks his head knocks again

CHARLIE
I think your pilot overslept

HUGH
You didnt let any girls in there

OFFICER EDMONDS
No sir not a soul No one came in

They all wait awkwardly as HUGH checks his watch and knocks
on the door More silence

OFFICER EDMONDS (CONTD)
I have a room key

CHARLIE takes the room key and lets himself in

INT THE ST JEROME HOTEL -- WHIPS ROOM -- MORNING

CHARLIE carefully enters WHIPs room He is spooked by the
silence HUGH joins him as they take in the room The bed
looks slept in and the room service dinner tray rests
politely on the dining table but WHIP is nowhere to be

HUGH LANG
Did he disappear

CHARLIE tentatively walks around the empty room the
bathroom the closet until he finally sees the adjoining
room door He turns to HUGH with a surprised look

CHARLIE
Whip Hello

CHARLIE knocks on the slightly opened adjoining door No
response so CHARLIE lightly tosses the door open
INT ADJOINING ROOM -- SAME TIME

CHARLIE looks in to find the scene of the crime Smoke still
hangs in the air and empty bottles and cans cover every
surface in the room HUGH joins him

HUGH
Where is he

CHARLIE

CHARLIE closes his eyes and says a silent prayer as he heads
for the bathroom
BATHROOM -- ADJOINING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

CHARLIE is stopped by the sight of WHIPs lifeless body
wedged between the tub and the toilet

CHARLIE
WHIP WHIP

CHARLIE turns WHIP over to see his non-responsive face HUGH
arrives and freaks out

HUGH
Is he dead

CHARLIE
I DONT KNOW

HUGH
IS HE DEAD

WHIP
Yes Im dead

CHARLIE shows immediate relief that WHIP is breathing
OFFICER EDMONDS has joined them

OFFICER EDMONDS
Should I get an ambulance

CHARLIE
Yes

HUGH
Waitjust wait Charlielets

The two stare at each other and realize they are both
breathing heavily from the shock and stress of their
predicament

CHARLIE
Get him to the bed
(to the Officer)

Can you wait outside and dont let
anyone in here Thank you

EDMONDS leaves CHARLIE and HUGH drag WHIP out of the
bathroom and flop him on the bed HUGH explodes

HUGH

Son of a bitch You worthless
motherfucker what a waste I

HUGH grabs at WHIPs collar and WHIP actually sits up and
reaches for HUGH a nice sign of life from WHIP

CHARLIE
WOAH WOAH WOAH Enough

CHARLIE pulls HUGH away from WHIP who falls back on the bed

CHARLIE (CONTD)
What time is it

HUGH

INT THE ST JEROME HOTEL -- ELEVATOR BANK -- SAME TIME

The elevator opens and we see HARLING step from the elevator
with his knapsack over his shoulder Teva sandals
sunglasses

INT THE ST JEROME HOTEL -- WHIPS ROOM -- MORNING

WHIP has a towel around his neck as he tries to sip coffee
CHARLIE sits opposite him at the small table by the window

The door bursts open and HARLING storms in

HARLING MAYS

HARLING places a leather doctors bag on the table An
anxious CHARLIE reaches for the bag which sets HARLING into

frenzy
HARLING MAYS (CONTD)

YOU DO NOT TOUCH THE MERCH
MOTHERFUCKER

Its quiet as HARLING gives orders
HARLING MAYS (CONTD)

Everyone except Whip and myself
take three steps away from the

table

As they step away HARLING now pulls a beautiful silver-
framed mirror from his bag and a blue coke grinder

calmly
but sternly delivers orders
HARLING MAYS (CONTD)
I need three things
(focuses on Charlie)
Two glasses of water a credit card
and a hundred dollar bill
CHARLIE
All I have is a twenty
HARLING MAYS

coco puff

HARLING Tosses a pack of smokes to CHARLIE
CHARLIE
A what
HUGH takes the smokes from CHARLIE and pulls out a
cigarette

he

HARLING stops grinding opens the lid and pours out a nice
smooth pile of coke He begins a masterful ballet of cocaine

manipulation

HUGH
Millions of dollars hang in the
balance

HUGH is removing the last quarter of an inch of tobacco from

the end of the cigarette

CHARLIE
They hang on the consumption of a
300 dollar bag of cocaine

HARLING uses the credit card to groom the coke into neat

piles and lines He has a system

WHIPs head sags as he again appears ready to pass out

HARLING MAYS
Okay Whip just two small whiffs
firstone on each sidejust a
primer
out

Using the mirror as a tray HARLING holds the rolled up 20
dollar bill just above the line of coke WHIP slowly manages
to place his face in position to ingest the coke Its tense
as his head wobbles He finally zeroes in and snorts the
first line HARLING quickly switches nostrils WHIP sniffs
the other side

HARLING MAYS (CONTD)
Atta boy head back now Swallow
Water chief you Water

CHARLIE puts the glass of water to WHIPs mouth WHIP
drinks

HARLING MAYS (CONTD)
(snaps his fingers)
Coco puff

HUGH hands HARLING the cigarette with a slightly hollowed

tip HARLING leans over the coke with the cigarette in his
mouth and hoovers up a small pile sucking the coke through
the cigarette

HARLING sits up careful to keep the cocaine in the end of
the cigarette He tips it up and lights it

HARLING MAYS (CONTD)
Little coco puff buddy Cmon
banana man Whos the banana man

WHIPs head levels a look to Harling with a smile that leads
us to believe that he is actually making a rally

HARLING MAYS (CONTD)
Good man focus up big dog Heres
the train comin to you

HARLING takes a puff and holds it as he extends the cocaine
cigarette to WHIP WHIP is more nimble now as he cocks his

head in acceptance of the cigarette WHIP takes a drag and

holds it

HARLING MAYS (CONTD)

(still holding the smoke)

Keep it down big dog banana boats

WHIP finally exhales the smoke HARLING does too WHIP
smiles
WHIP
The banana boat is here

HARLING MAYS

WHIP

HARLING gathers his things stands and hugs WHIP

HARLING MAYS

WHIP

HUGH and CHARLIE are quiet as they watch the strange but
sincere drug-fueled emotion pass between two old friends
HARLING eyes CHARLIE before handing him a baggie

HARLING MAYS
Theres a gram in here you paid

just before we see WHIP step out of the hotel room and

a relatively steady strut down the hallway Deja Vu
Sunglasses on WHIP is backed by HUGH and CHARLIE who flank
him from a few steps behind Further back we can see that
OFFICER EDWARDS also exits the room wearing latex gloves
carrying a large plastic garbage bag that obviously holds

evidence of the debauched night or the mornings

CHARLIE
Morning

We watch as a small trickle of blood escapes from WHIPs
nostril HUGH pulls a handkerchief from his pocket hands
to WHIP

HUGH
Your nose

WHIP accepts the handkerchief and wipes his nose WHIP sees

blood on the cloth and tilts his head back

We now see that there is a mirrored ceiling to the elevator
WHIP tries to study his reflection in the ceiling as he

the hankie to his nose WHIP begins to wobble and CHARLIE
helps him regain his balance

INT THE ST JEROME HOTEL-ELEVATOR LOBBY-MOMENTS LATER

Our TRIO walk as tall as they can towards the hearing room

HUGH
Im gonna head in and tell Ellen
Block that were here
HUGH hustles off as CHARLIE pulls close to WHIP

CHARLIE
Youre gonna make it Remember if
they ask about your drinking its
totally acceptable to say I dont
recall

WHIP wheels on CHARLIE and unloads with focused anger

WHIP

Do not tell me how to lie about my
drinking Ive been lying about my
drinking my whole life

As we disappear in to WHIPs weary eyes we hear the
distinctive sound of a jetliner screaming through the air

INT THE ST JEROME HOTEL - BALL ROOM - NTSB HEARING-DAY

On TWO LARGE SCREENS we watch the grainy cell phone footage
shot by a witness of SOUTHJET FLIGHT 227s final moments in
the sky ACCOMPANYING the Video is the REAL AUDIO of the
cockpit voice recording

The room has a dais where the NTSB board members sit A
large blue curtain is the backing for the round NTSB shield
that hangs above the proceedings A large drop down screen
will show images graph and text as needed by the NTSB

A confident woman ELLEN BLOCK approaches carrying a file
which she lays on the podium

ELLEN BLOCK
Those are difficult images to
watch For the record Im Ellen
Block Hearing Officer for this
hearing Captain Whitaker good
morning

We see WHIP who looks rough but stable in his witness chair

WHIP
Morning

ELLEN BLOCK
What was captured on that video is
that the aircraft was ina
follow

relatively stable glide just prior
to the moment of impact

However according to the data we
retrieved from the cockpit data
recorders at exactly 934 after
flying 27 minutes without incident
the transponder recorded a loss in
altitude in excess of 4800 feet per
minute in what is considered a
full pitch nose down attitude
Then at 942 according to the data
recorders a decision was made to
invert the aircraft The NTSB has
created animated simulation that I
would like to play at this point

ELLEN points to the screen
An NTSB animation shows the plane pitching down and we

it through the inversion of the plane while listening to the
real audio of the flight crew

The animation has a split screen that also shows the
instruments and printed text of whats being said

We hearWhats your sons name Why The black box
I love you Trevor Be a good boy Mommy loves you What
are we doing Why would I trim down Were gonna roll

it Ready Here we go Ive got control

That last statement seems to echo as the presentation stops
and the lights come back up We return to the hearing in
progress

ELLEN BLOCK (CONTD)

That audio is tragic and
compelling I chose to play that
part of the cockpit recording to
highlight a key moment aboard
flight 227 wherein you say Were
gonna roll it here we go Ive got
control You made a very
conscious decision to invert the
airplane to roll the plane upside
down Is that correct

WHIP
Im not sure it was conscious It
was more of an instinct
ELLEN BLOCK
What led to that decision

WHIP is clearly struggling in his chair The coke got him
there but it may start to fail him soon

WHIP
I dont recall

ELLEN BLOCK
Let me quote from an investigative
summaryFrom 934 until 942 the
events on the aircraft areagain
I quote bold and remarkable
By inverting the plane Captain
Whitaker arrested the descent and
allowed the aircraft to level off
enabling him to glide the aircraft
away from any populated areas and
allowing him to execute a forced
landing in an open field

We hear a smattering of applause as the facts of his actions
are remarkable

WHIP
I heard a metallic bang We
pitched nose down No control

WHIP looks ashen as the booze and chemicals are still
coursing through his exhausted frame

ELLEN BLOCK
You had no idea what was wrong with
the aircraft

WHIP
There was a lot of things wrong
with that aircraft

WHIP glances towards HUGH and CHARLIE who are poker-faced

ELLEN BLOCK
As I said before you can add any
details you like to any comments I
make Do you remember any thing
else that was out of the ordinary
Did you feel the flight crew was in
their best shape

WHIP takes a minute to digest this question
WHIP
Yes

ELLEN BLOCK
It was raining very hard the
morning you took off wasnt it

WHIP
There was some convective activity
in the area However my first
officer and I discussed the
conditions on the field and
determined that we were safely
within our visibility and crosswind
minimums

ELLEN BLOCK
Yes first officer Evans testimony
confirms the same

WHIP goes quiet as ELLEN BLOCK looks at him over her
glasses
seeing if he has any reaction WHIP smiles

ELLEN BLOCK (CONTD)
I want to show you something

HUGH is frozen in a steely gaze CHARLIE seems to hold his
breath

ELLEN BLOCK (CONTD)
Nothings happening

ELLEN points her remote at the projector but it doesnt
work

ELLEN BLOCK (CONTD)
This remote is not working
Apologies I can do it manually

She shrugs and heads down onto the stage closer to WHIP
where
she can advance the slides by touching the projector

We now see a screen where a slide is showing a long metal
screw the size of a trombone

ELLEN BLOCK (CONTD)
This is the jackscrew on the tail
assembly which articulates the
last

horizontal stabilizer--also known
as the elevator As you can see
the threads on this screw are

almost entirely gone

Substandard thread life is how we
reported it This part was
suggested as a maintenance
replacement in January of 2010 It
was never replaced

This had 1200 additional hours of
flight on it It finally failed

AN ANIMATION SHOWS THE TAIL ASSEMBLY

We watch the elevator acting as a wing on the tail that goes
up or down and makes a plane get lift or descend

ELLEN BLOCK (CONTD)
Our investigators have concluded
that the jackscrew snapped and the
elevator was frozen in a fixed
position locking the elevator ina
down position which forced the
plane into a dive The loss of the
elevator was and I quote our
report a catastrophic event from
which recovery was improbable and
stable flight impossible

Everyone goes quiet as those words resonate ELLENs tone
changes as she understands how hard this is for some people

to hear as they think of their loved ones spending their

living minutes on this earth in sheer terror

It is deathly quiet in the ballroom Even the PRESS are
silent

ELLEN BLOCK (CONTD)

Again I quoteFrom 934 until
942 the piloting decisions made by
Captain Whitaker were bold and
remarkable The fact that Captain
Whitaker commanded that the
aircraft stay inverted while
descending to an extremely low
altitude shows a miraculous
intuition that in this instance
saved 96 lives
A genuine applause spreads from the hearing room ELLEN

BLOCK allows this moment to happen

WHIP is fading dazed and uncomfortable with the unexpected

adulation He stands up

WHIP

I appreciate that

The room gets quiet as WHIPs demeanor seems terse

WHIP stares at ELLEN white with sweat and chemicals

We see

HUGH grind his jaw as this line of questioning has him on

tilt

ELLEN BLOCK
Mr Whitaker I want to talk about
the days leading and hours leading
up to the accident But before I
do I want to remind you that you
are under oath and any testimony
that you give here today will be
considered admissable in any
subsequent hearings or criminal
proceedings do you understand what
that means

WHIP nods

ELLEN BLOCK (CONTD)
Captain Whitaker for the record I
need you to verbalize your answer

WHIP
Yes I understand

ELLEN BLOCK
On the three days leading up to the
day of the accident -- Tuesday
October 11th Wednesday October
12th or Thursday October 13th of
2011 -- did you consume any alcohol
or other intoxicating elements

WHIP takes his time

WHIP
No I did not

HUGH AND CHARLIE
Sit stone faced in the second row feeling the relief of
months of hard work

ELLEN BLOCK continues with a rote posture

ELLEN BLOCK
On the morning of the accident
Friday October 14th did you
consume any alcohol or ingest any
chemicals or drugs that may have
impaired your ability to perform
your job

WHIP
No I did not

ELLEN wraps up this line of questions

ELLEN BLOCK
Mr Whitaker do you now or have
you ever had a problem with alcohol
dependency alcoholism or drug
addiction

WHIP waits for her to look at himthis takes a while

WHIP
No

HUGH maintains a poker face CHARLIE appears relieved

ELLEN sorts through her notes one last time

ELLEN BLOCK
ay Mr Whitaker were about
one
She refers to her notes)
ue to the severe turbulence during
he early part of the flight you
sked the flight crew to suspend
he beverage service on the plane
Is that correct

toa toeao

WHIP
Yes I suspended the drink
service

ELLEN BLOCK
Are you aware that our
investigators found two single-
service Vodka bottles in the galley
trash bin

Slides now show the TWO SMALL VODKA BOTTLES in evidence

WHIP
Yes

ELLEN BLOCK
There were 5 crew members on board
the flight who would have had
access to the beverage trolley
Less than an hour after the
accident blood was taken from each

of the crew members Yourself

A SOUTHJET CORPORATE PHOTO OF WHIP pops on to the large
monitors After ELLEN references a member of the flight
crew their photo pops on to the monitors

ELLEN BLOCK (CONTD)

First Officer Evans flight
attendant Margaret Thomason and
posthumously from Camelia Satou and
Katerina Marquez

KATERINA MARQUEZ PHOTO does not pop up on the screenyet

ELLEN BLOCK (CONTD)

A toxicology analysis was performed
and three of these tests came back
negative one was disqualified for
technical reasons

Hugh smiles -- satisfied

ELLEN BLOCK (CONTD)

And one tested positive for
alcohol It registered a 17 blood
alcohol level Are you aware of
that

WHIP
I am now

ELLEN BLOCK
Miss Marquez was not only a
colleague but you knew her outside
of work Correct

WHIP
Outside of work Not really

ELLEN BLOCK
Did you know Miss Marquez had a
drinking problem

WHIP
No I did not

ELLEN BLOCK
Did you ever see her drink to
excess

WHIP
No I did not

ELLEN BLOCK
Did you know that she was twice
treated for alcohol addiction The
last time was 16 months ago and
paid for by SouthJet Airlines

WHIP
No I did not

A picture of Trinas beautiful smiling face FLASHES UP ON
THE
BIG SCREEN

ELLEN BLOCK
Is it your opinion that Katerina
Marquez drank the vodka on the
plane

WHIP smiles at the photo of TRINA as if she can see him He
then shakes his head to snap from the memory of her great
spirit He gets serious as he bears his look down on ELLEN

WHIP
Can you repeat the question

ELLEN BLOCK
Your opinion Captain Is it your
opinion that Katerina Marquez drank
on that flight

Whip shakes He runs his trembling hand through his hair

WHIP
Im sorry My what
ELLEN BLOCK
Since her toxicology report is the
only toxicology report that is
admissable in this hearing and she
in fact tested positive for
alcohol is it your opinion that
Katerina Marquez drank those 2
bottles of vodka on the flight

Whip drops his head and MUTTERS SOMETHING INAUDIBLE

ELLEN BLOCK (CONTD)
Im sorry Mr Whitaker I couldnt
hear you What did you say

WHIP
I SAIDGod help me

A confused MUMBLE rises in the room Whips response
flusters ELLEN for a moment but she recovers quickly

ELLEN BLOCK
Yes well However is it your
opinion

Whip cuts her off

WHIP
(EXCESSIVELY LOUD)
ITS MY OPINION
(lowers his voice)
Its my opinion
Trina DID NOTdrink the vodka

ELLEN BLOCK
Excuse me Mr Whitaker

WHIP
(softly to himself)
She saved that boys life

ELLEN BLOCK
Captain Whitaker can you speak
LOUDER-

WHIP
(LOUD AGAIN)
I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT SHE DID NOT
DRINK THAT VODKA

Whip stops His whole body trembles his face tightens

He
looks right at ELLEN
WHIP (CONTD)
because I did I drank the
vodka
The crowd gasps unsure of what they just heard

CHARLIE rockets out of his chair

CHARLIE
OBJECTION

NTSB OFFICER 2
Please be seated sir This is not a

court room

Now CHARLIE returns to his chair to find that HUGH is gone
CHARLIE looks around for HUGH no sign Hes vanished

WHIP leans close to the microphone

WHIP
I drank the vodka bottles on the
plane

ELLEN BLOCK
Mr Whitaker in light of that
remark would you like to
readdress

WHIP
You dont have to readdress
anything I DRANK THE VODKA

ELLEN BLOCK
On the three nights before the
accident October 11th-

WHIP
On October 11th 12th and 13th and
14th I was intoxicated I drank
alcohol on all of those days I
drank to excess

Chaos erupts further as REPORTERS outnumber SECURITY Flash

bulbs pop repeatedly and large lights are aimed at the
fracas

on stage as video is taken of the bizarre melee

ELLEN BLOCK
Mr Whitaker on the morning of
OCTOBER-

WHIP
I was drunk Im drunk right now
Miss BlockIm drunk right
(Whip finally breaks down)
Im drunk now because
Because Im an alcoholic

We have pushed into a tight shot on WHIPs face as the sound
in the room fades away We stay tight on WHIPs face as he
lets the moments unfold

Suddenly the noise cuts to silence WHIP is looking at the
assembly WHIP wipes tears from his eyes We hear WHIPs
voice as the dialogue pre-laps the image of his face

WHIP (VO)

That was itI was done Its as
if Id hit my life long limit for
lies

A new angle shows WHIP speaking these words

WHIP
I could not tell one more lie And
maybe Im a sucker Because if I
had just told one more lie I could
have walked away from that whole
mess and kept my wings and my false
sense of pride and most importantly
I would have avoided being locked
up here with all of you nice folks
for the last 13 months

We hear laughter as we pull out from WHIP to realize that he
is in fact wearing a white penal jumpsuit and leading an AA
meeting in a Federal Prison

WHIP (CONTD)
It looks like I will serve every
day of the remaining 4 plus years
of my sentence And thats fair
I betrayed the public trust I
did Thats what the judge
explained to me I had betrayed
the public trust The FAA took my
license And thats fair The
chances of me flying again are slim

of

to none And I accept that

INT MCRAE FEDERAL PENITENTIARY -- GEORGIA -- DAY

A large room houses an AA meeting for about 50 inmates
wearing white jumpsuits WHIP continues his story

WHIP
Ive had time to think about all of
it Doing a lot of writing Ive
written letters to each of the
families that lost loved ones on my
flight Some were able to hear my
apology some never will
Ive also apologized to all the
people who tried to help me along
the way but I couldnt or wouldnt
listen like my wife I mean my ex
wife
(he gets emotional)
and my son Again some were
able to forgive mesome never
will

(COLLECTS HIMSELF)
But at least Im sober and Im
grateful for that

Whip gives it to us straight

WHIP (CONTD)
And this is gonna sound really
stupid coming from a man whos in
prisonbut for the first time in
my lifeIm free

We hold close on WHIPs face as we hear the metallic clang

prison doors shutting On the sound we cut to

INT FEDERAL PENITENTIARY -- CELL -- DAY

We pan across the concrete cell wall looking at a small
personal photo collage We see a photo of NICOLE and SHEILA
and a few other AA FOLKS surrounding WHIP who sits in front
of a birthday cake in the common room of the prison We see
a photo of WHIPs DAD as an airman We ultimately land ona
photo of NICOLE We recognize it as the photo WHIP took on
the porch of the Whitaker Farm
We pan down to find WHIP writing in a journal A GUARD comes
to the front of his cell

GUARD
Whitaker you got a visitor

WHIP looks at the GUARD and nods before taking a last glance
at the photo of NICOLE
EXT FEDERAL PENITENTIARY -- GUEST YARD -- DAY

WHIP sits at a lone picnic table in a fence-enclosed
courtyard He checks his watch and looks up

WHIP stands and walks towards us towards his visitor As he
gets closer we see a smile break across his face A smile we
havent seen since he first saw NICOLE We reverse to see

WILL -- WHIPs 17 year old son stands next to a GUARD

GUARD
You have 40 minutes

WHIP
Knuckles youre looking good
(BEAT)
I sent you something for your
birthday
WILL

Yeah I got it

Another beat as they cant find a way in to a conversation

WHIP
This is a real surprise a great
surprise I havent seen you-

WHIP chokes up WILL nods Its intense WHIP motions to
the table and they both sit WILL pulls out a notebook

WILL
College counselor thought I should
come and interview you

WHIP

WILL

applications
WHIP studies him and laughsWILL nods and tries to smile

WHIP
Listen Will it means everything to

amazing kid and you deserve great
things

Again WHIP has to tamp down his emotions

WILL
