VISUAL NOTE

The flashbacks of trauma will be shot at 15fps and there will
be a “roar” over these scenes animal andor machine-like

EXT SCHOOLHOUSE - MORNING 1

A BOYS FEET WALK ALONG A THIN FENCE AARON balances on
a fence We follow him as he walks along the fence all the
way along a path that leads to a barn We follow him around
the barn and the pen where a couple of YEARLINGS graze He is
followed in complete silence by a group of about 14 BOYS
who walk on the ground beside him watching his every move
wondering if he will fall

Beside them walks the SCHOOL TEACHER AUGUST who watches him
silently willing him not to fall
Blue Rev 2

AARON manages to walk the entire length of the fence around

the paddock until its end When he is done he hops down and
the boys erupt in rapturous applause as August watches them

closely

August looks off into the distance where he sees a GROUP OF
MEN coming towards the boys looking stern

AUGUST (VO)
The attacks were originally
attributed to ghosts and demons

EXT ROAD - MORNING 2

A GROUP OF 7 WOMEN walk along a dusty road A WIND picks up
They hold onto their hats

INT CHURCH - MORNING 3
DOZENS OF MEN bow their heads on the floor in silent prayer

AUGUST (VO)
When the women woke up feeling
drowsy and in pain their bodies
bruised and bleeding many believed
they were being made to suffer as
punishment for their sins
Many accused the women of lying for
attention or to cover up adultery

CUT TO

EXT FIELD - SUNSET (ONE WEEK PRIOR TO THE VOTE) 4

Ona Salome Salome’s 3 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER MIEP and August
sit in a field They stare out over the fields at Miep
playing in the soy field

SALOME
Hundreds of times All of us

Salome watches Miep They all stare in silence at her for a
while WE FOLLOW MIEP her fragile little body as she
creates a path through the soy field as we hear the adults’
conversation low in the background
Pink Rev 3

ONA
They said we were dreaming
But then we realized that we were
dreaming one dream and it wasn’t a
dream at all

We come back to August’s face tears streaming out of his
eyes He tries to quickly wipe them away Salome looks at
him she looks away We go with Miep deeper into the field

SALOME (0S)
They told us that it was Satan Or
the result of wild female
imagination

OVER MIEP WALKING INTO THE DISTANCE WE SEE THE FOLLOWING
TEXT

“WHAT FOLLOWS IS AN ACT OF FEMALE IMAGINATION”
OVER BLACK
ONA (VO)

I’m glad you’re back August It’s

good that you came back
INT SALOMES KITCHEN - NIGHT 5
NEITJE hunches over a drawing SALOME MARICHE MEJAL ONA AGATA and GRETA AUTJE watch her as she draws
Salome points to three separate drawings as Neitje tells her
what they signify Salome points to a drawing of a field with

clouds over it

NEITJE
“Do nothing”

Salome points at a drawing of a man and a woman knives drawn
towards each other in battle

SALOME
“Stay and fight”

Salome points to a drawing of a horse it’s back to us

SALOME NEITJE
“Leave”

Salome pats Neitje’s shoulder approvingly
Salmon Rev 4

EXT DILAPIDATED BARN - MORNING 6

August holds a gun in his hand He seems to be walking in
circles in the field unsure what to do

AUGUST (VO)
I have been in love with Ona
Friesen for most of my life This
morning she found me having lost
my faith in everything

We are behind Ona walking towards him on the path She sees
the gun by his side

ONA
August

He is startled and tries to hide the gun

ONA (CONTD)
Where are you going

AUGUST
Nowhere

Ona smiles at him She thinks for a moment She comes very
close to him her face very close to his

ONA
Early this morning I saw a squirrel
and a rabbit

A pause

AUGUST
Oh

ONA
The squirrel charged the rabbit
Just as the squirrel was about to
make contact with the rabbit the
rabbit leapt straight up into the
air Then the squirrel turned
around and charged the rabbit from
the other direction and the rabbit
leapt into the air and the squirrel
missed

August looks at her bemused

ONA (CONTD)
They were playing
Salmon Rev 4A

AUGUST
Is that so

ONA
Maybe I wasn’t meant to have seen
them playing It was very early in
the morning and I was the only one
roaming around

AUGUST
But you really saw that

ONA
Yes I saw it with my own eyes

Ona watches him closely for a long time She takes August’s
arm and pulls him with her

ONA (CONTD)
We need you

AUGUST
What do you need me for

ONA
We need you to take the minutes of
our meeting

She walks away She looks behind her to make sure he
follows He does
EXT FIELD - MORNING 7

NETTIEMELVIN dressed as a man plays a game of tag
with a group of 13 children of varying ages including JULIUS Cherry Rev 5

We follow the children closely in their game and feel their
sweat and excitement We drift up to the sky a flock of
birds going by

INT HAYLOFT - EARLY AFTERNOON 8

The Women (Agata Greta Ona Salome Mariche Autje Neitje
Mejal Scarface Anna and Helena)take off their socks and
shoes Some wear plastic sandals with white socks The
younger women Neitje and Autje wear torn canvas shoes with
white socks rolled down around their ankles Mejal and Autje
have rope burns on their ankles The older women wear sturdy
leather sandals

AGATA (VO)
We must honour our service to each
other We must represent it Just
as the feet of the disciples were
washed by Jesus at the Last Supper
knowing that his hour had come

The Women wash each others feet They wash the feet of the
person sitting to their right They take time they do it

slowly August looks at the ground not wanting to impose

himself

As the women finish washing each others feet they murmur
“God Bless You” to each other Neitje and Autje try to
suppress giggles

AUTJE
(To Neitje giggling and
whispering )
Stop You’re tickling me

NEITJE
(in a solemn grown up
voice)
God Bless You

This makes Autje laugh even harder She tries to hide her
face in her sleeve August sits down at a table and writes in
a notebook We hear what he is writing as WE TRAVEL SLOWLY
OVER THE FACE OF EACH WOMAN sitting in silence waiting for
the discussion to begin

AUGUST (VO)
At this moment in time most of the
men are gone from the colony
(MORE)

Cherry Rev 6

AUGUST (VO) (CONTD)
All of the able bodied men
excluding those in wheelchairs the
elderly and me the schoolteacher
left yesterday for the city to post
bail for the imprisoned attackers
leaving the women free to talk
openly with one another

We hear on the soundtrack the THUNDEROUS SOUND OF BOOTS

FLASHBACK TO

EXT COLONY ROAD - DAWN 9

We see endless pairs of TALL BLACK BOOTS walking quickly in
the dirt They make a thunderous almost other-worldly noise
The MEN OF THE COLONY including PETERS ELDERS and KLAAS
(Mariche’s husband) gather buggies in a convoy The WOMEN
including Mariche Agata Salome Mejal help load them up
The Women for the most part keep their heads down avoiding
eye contact The Men stand with their horses looking at the
women who stand there across from them Peters eyes them
monitoring

PETERS
We will be back in two days

AUGUST (VO)
When they return in 24 hours the
women will be given the opportunity
to forgive these men guaranteeing
everyone’s place in heaven

The Men get into their buggies and ride off The Women watch
them go left in a cloud of dust behind the horses and
buggies A TREMENDOUS SOUND as they rumble off leaving the
women behind We see them from above the distance between
the men and women becoming greater

INT HAYLOFT - EARLY AFTERNOON 10
We continue to land on the face of each woman one by one

AUGUST (VO)
My name is August Epp Two months
ago I returned from the outside
world to this colony where I was
raised

(MORE )
Cherry Rev AUGUST (VO) (CONTD)
I am now the colony schoolteacher
and I have been asked to take the
minutes of the meetings because the
women are functionally illiterate
having had very little education

We land on Ona who watches August writing tenderly

6A

Yellow Rev 7

AUGUST (VO)
Ona Friesen asked me if I would
take the minutes and as I had
nothing to do but kill myself and
as I have been in love with her for
most of my life and would do
anything for her I agreed

August looks up at Ona he smiles lightly at her He then
returns to his writing The Women set themselves up in a kind
of haphazard circle

INT BARN - MORNING 11

The WOMEN OF THE COLONY (we see over a hundred of them here)
take turns in a crudely built ballot box Some murmur to each
other Coffee is served at a table with summer sausage and
buns

AUGUST (VO)
A vote was held earlier this
morning

The women take turns marking the paper with Neitje’s
drawings by writing an “X” next to one of the drawings We
follow SCARFACE JANZ as she puts an “X” next to the “Do
Nothing” picture So do ANNA and HELENA ( 16) We watch
as the women all mark down their votes Ona Mejal Mariche
Agata Autje and Neitje Greta thinks for a long moment and
then votes

OMITTED 12

OMITTED 13

Double Pink Rev 8

INT HAYLOFT - EARLY AFTERNOON 14

The Reimers sit roughly on one side and the Friesens sit on
the other The Janz family sit further in the corner There
is a table fashioned out of a piece of plywood laid across
hay bales Their chairs are milking buckets Neitje draws a
portrait of Scarface Janz and her girls

AUGUST (VO)
As the vote was tied between the
option of Staying and Fighting or
Leaving representatives of two
families of women the Reimers and
the Friesens have been tasked with
deciding whether or not to Stay and
Fight or Leave while the rest of
the women tend to the work of the
colony They have invited
representatives of the Janz family
to be part of the conversation
though they voted to do nothing
They are meeting in Earnest
Penner’s hayloft as he is senile
and rarely comes in

Scarface takes a deep breath and begins
SCARFACE JANZ
It is part of our faith to forgive
We have always forgiven those who
have wronged us Why not now

SALOME
Because now we know better

SCARFACE JANZ
Better than God You know better
than God

ANNA
Our Lord requires us to forgive
Salome Or do you believe yourself
mightier than he

SCARFACE JANZ
We will be excommunicated forced
to leave the colony in disgrace if
we don’t forgive the men And if we
are excommunicated we will forfeit
our place in heaven

HELENA
How could any of you live with the
fear of that

Agata looks at Helena softly
AGATA
What else are you afraid of Helena

Tell us We want to hear

Agata moves towards Helena and sits on an overturned milk
pail at her side holding her hand

HELENA
(quietly)
We can only do what we have
learned
GRETA
Speak up Helena We can’t hear
you
HELENA
(louder )

We have only domestic skills How
are we supposed to survive out in
the World if we are excommunicated

ANNA
We are unable to read or write
Weve never even seen a map

Agata nods sympathetically

AGATA
These are all legitimate fears How
can we address them

Agata looks around at the women inviting them to speak

SALOME
Shouldn’t we be concerned about
more than just our survival
Helena Is what we have lived
worth preserving

SCARFACE JANZ
These questions themselves are
blasphemous

There is a long silence

GRETA
Alright No more blasphemous
questions I want to talk about my
horses Ruth and Cheryl

FLASHBACK TO

15 INT GRETA’S HORSE BARN - EARLY MORNING 15

Greta lovingly tends to her team of old horses RUTH AND
CHERYL She brushes them looks into their eyes smiles
tenderly She breaks contact a sadness coming over her She
gives them a final pat as she walks away

GRETA
Alright We’ll go

16 EXT ROAD - EARLY MORNING 16

Greta drives her buggy along the road with her old horses
Ruth and Cheryl We see from Greta’s POV Ahead of them a
ROTTWEILER APPEARS and barks Ruth and Cheryl begin to bolt
Greta struggles to keep them on the road

Cherry Rev 11

GRETA (VO)
When Ruth and Cheryl are frightened
by Dueck’s Rottweilers on the mile
road that leads to the church
their initial instinct is to bolt
These horses don’t organize
meetings to decide what they will
do They run

On Greta’s POV of Ruth and Cheryl’s manes flying in the wind
as they bolt into the field

CUT BACK TO

INT HAYLOFT - EARLY AFTERNOON 17
Agata laughs

AGATA
But Greta we are not animals

GRETA
We have been preyed upon like
animals Maybe we should respond
like animals

ONA
Do you mean run away

SALOME
Or kill our attackers

Mariche makes a soft scoffing sound

FLASHBACK TO

EXT SHED - 2 DAYS EARLIER - AFTERNOON 18

Salome runs shrieking with a scythe at a shed We see
through the slats as THE 5 MEN INSIDE yell for help and try
to back into the corner of the shed Salome breaks the lock
She slashes at one of the MEN with her scythe She is pulled
away by PETERS along with a FEW OTHER MEN She is pushed to
the ground We see the blood from the man on her face PETERS
looks around breathless He puts his face in his hands at
the end of his rope When he looks up he has made a
decision

Yellow Rev PETERS
Go Go to the city Get the police

The other men look questioningly at Peters

PETERS (CONTD)
For their own protection These men
need to be taken to jail in the
city

CUT BACK TO

INT HAYLOFT - EARLY AFTERNOON

AGATA
In my lifetime I have seen horses
confront angry dogs and try to
stomp them to death Animals don’t
always flee their attackers They
can fight back and they can run
away

She inhales deeply

AGATA (CONTD)
Either way it’s a waste of time to
try to establish whether we are
animals The men will be coming
back from the city after they pay
the bail for our attackers Soon

SCARFACE JANZ

The only important thing to
establish is whether we forgive the
men so that we are allowed to enter
the gates of heaven

Salome laughs loudly She stands up and goes to the south
doors and throws them open

MARICHE
Laugh all you want Salome But we
will be forced to leave the colony
if we don’t forgive the men And
how will the Lord when He arrives
find all the women if we aren’t in
our colony

Cherry Rev SALOME
If Jesus is able to return to life
live for thousands of years and
then drop down to earth from
heaven to scoop up his supporters
surely he’d also be able to locate
a few women who-

Agata makes a quick gesture to silence Salome Scarface

shakes her head appalled

AGATA
Let’s stay on track-

Salome moves quickly back towards the circle of women

SALOME
Alright I’1l stay on track I
cannot forgive them I will never
forgive them

MEJAL
I can’t either

Autje nods
MARICHE

But we want to enter the gates of
heaven when we die

Agata and Greta nod Everyone is silent for a while They

sit thinking

ONA
Are we asking ourselves what our
priority is To protect our
children or to enter the kingdom of
heaven

Salome makes a sound of frustration She kicks a bucket

Greta goes and retrieves it and sits back down

MEJAL
No That is not what we are asking
That is an exaggeration of what we
are discussing

ONA
What are we discussing then

AGATA
We will burn that bridge when we
come to it

Salmon Rev SCARFACE JANZ
We have everything we want here

Salome shakes her head

SALOME

SCARFACE JANZ
Want less

Salome looks at her and laughs out loud

SCARFACE JANZ (CONTD)
Does entering the kingdom of heaven
mean nothing to any of you After
all we have suffered

ANNA
Are you really willing to give up
what we have always lived for

ONA
Surely there is something in this
life worth living for not only in
the next

SCARFACE JANZ
Are you abandoning your faith

AGATA
(to Scarface)
We cannot stand by and do nothing
when our children are harmed

SCARFACE JANZ
(to Ona Agata and Salome)
How are you protecting your
children from harm if you turn your
back on God And how will any of
you survive If you stay and fight
you will lose Or if you leave

HELENA
Where will you go

Scarface stands to leave Agata steps towards Scarface

AGATA
(to Scarface Janz)
All I know is that we cannot do
nothing
(MORE )

Salmon Rev 14a

AGATA (CONTD)
By doing nothing we are not
protecting our children who were
given to us by God to protect and
nurture

Cherry Rev 15

SCARFACE JANZ
We will not be damned to hell with
you

AGATA
That is your decision and we must
respect it

Scarface takes Helena’s hand in hers and motions to Anna to
follow Autje crosses the room and lightly touches Helena’s
hand As Scarface pulls her way Autje grabs for it one more
time and then lets go Anna looks back making eye contact
with Mariche but follows her mother and Helena Mariche
pushes her milk pail back the edge scraping on the floor
taking her mother’s attention But she does not leave with
the Janz women There is silence after the Janz family
leaves Agata addresses the group

AGATA (CONTD)

We must decide now whether we will
stay and fight or leave These are
the options in front of us We will
not do nothing

Autje goes and sits behind her family and Neitje joins her
grabbing her hand

EXT BARN - AFTERNOON 20

The sun is slightly lower in the sky

INT SCARFACE JANZ’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON 21

Scarface Janz sits quietly at her spotless kitchen table her
adult children and their children running around doing chores
behind her She looks out the window looking haunted

After some time Anna and Helena enter and sit beside her
Anna is shaking They sit in silence for a long time We
follow Scarface Janz as she walks through her house and out
her front door She stands and stares at the hayloft in the
distance She turns away and looks at the horizon

Anna looks down at the kitchen table breathing hard trying
to contain her panic Helena puts a hand on her mother’s arm
INT HAYLOFT - AFTERNOON 22

The remaining women sit in silence Autje swings from a beam
above the women The silence is broken by Greta
Cherry Rev 15A

GRETA
I believe the only solution is to
flee
Blue Rev SALOME
Is this how we want to teach our
daughters to defend themselves By
fleeing

GRETA
Not fleeing but leaving I am
talking about leaving

Salome continues as though she hasn’t heard Greta

SALOME
Id rather stand my ground and
shoot each man in the heart and
bury them in a pit than flee And
I’1l deal with God’s wrath if I
have to

ONA
(gently)
Salome Aunt Greta is talking about
leaving not fleeing The word
“fleeing” wasn’t what they meant

Mariche shakes her head indignant

MARICHE
Please forgive my mother for using
the wrong word It is a sin so
outrageous that Salome must take
it upon herself to rectify for the
sake of all humanity

AGATA
“Leaving” and “fleeing” are
different words With different
meanings They each say something
about us

Agata notices August watching
AGATA (CONTD)
August what do you make of all
this Do you have an opinion too

Agata goes to August and puts her arm around his shoulder

AGATA (CONTD)
Well August

August thinks for a while

Cherry Rev 17

AUGUST
I think I think that it is
possible to leave something or
someone in one frame of mind and
arrive elsewhere in another
entirely unexpected frame of mind

MARICHE
We are already aware of this

ONA
We are aware of many things in our
hearts But it is good sometimes
to have them said out loud

MEJAL
I want to stay and fight

Everyone stares at Mejal her assurance She takes a sharp
inhale of breath

MARICHE
Won’t we lose the fight to the men
and then be forced to forgive them
anyway

ONA
Is forgiveness that is forced upon
us true forgiveness

A bit of straw falls from Autje’s swinging into Mariche’s
hair She looks up at Autje

MARICHE
Autje

MEJAL
Behave yourself Can’t you hear the
rafter creaking Do you want the
roof to cave in

August looks up smiles to himself Mejal reaches for her
pouch of tobacco and rests her hand lightly on it Autje gets

down and she and Netje play a clapping game with their hands
hidden beneath the table

Greta takes her false teeth out She taps them on the plywood
and pops them back in

SALOME
I want to stay and fight too
Salmon Rev Everyone looks at Salome

MARICHE
Of course you do No one is
surprised that you do All you do
is fight Is this how we are to
decide the fates of all of the
women of this colony Just another
vote where we put an X next to our
position I thought we were here to
do more than that

SALOME
You mean talk more about forgiving
the men and doing nothing

MARICHE
Everything else is insane But none
of you will listen to reason

SALOME
Why are you here then Why are you
still here with us if that is what
you believe Leave with the rest
of the do-nothing women

GRETA
She is my daughter and I want her
here with us

AGATA
I believe we are capable of hearing
opinions other than our own Or how
can we expect anything to change

Everyone is quiet respectful of Agata and Greta

AUTJE
(whispering to Neitje)
This is never going to end

NEITJE
(whispering to Autje)
Well be dead and they’11 still be
talking

AUTJE
(whispering)
Or worse We might have to live
through it

Neitje and Autje are in a body language contest of who can
convey their boredom the best

Cherry Rev 18A

Autje pretends to shoot herself in the head by inserting a
rifle into her mouth then slumping over on her milk pail

Ona gets a large roll of butcher paper from the corner and
hands it to August

ONA
August I think you should make
lists of the pros and cons for both
options Staying and Fighting or
Leaving And write large Post it
on the wall

MEJAL
Why We can’t read it

ONA
No But we will keep it here as an
artifact for others to discover
Cherry Rev 19

SALOME
(tenderly)
Yes A discovery

Mejal helps Neitje and Autje post a large piece of butcher
paper to the wall and he writes on it Then they continue to
post the pages August has already written on the wall Mejal
looks down at her hands which are trembling

ONA
I think the first heading should
read as follows Staying and
Fighting Beneath that write Pros

AGATA
Who will go first

The Women begin to talk very rapidly asserting their ideas
August puts his hand up gently

AUGUST
Forgive me Please excuse me
Forgive me May I request that you
take turns speaking so that I can
understand what each of you is
saying It takes me a few seconds
to transcribeI’m a little behind
here I have to catch up

MARICHE
Shall we put up our hands As
though we are children in your
schoolhouse

AUGUST
I apologize

SALOME
We won’t have to leave

AUGUST
Excuse me

MARICHE
Write it down Under pros Salome
has had a brilliant idea

MARICHE (CONTD)
(theatrically mocking
Salome)
“If we stay we won’t have to
leave”

Salome glares at Mariche August writes this down

NEITJE
(shrugging half hearted)
We won’t have to pack

August writes this down as well

MEJAL
We won’t have to figure out where
were going or experience the
uncertainty of not knowing where we
are going We don’t have a map

Salome scoffs

SALOME
That’s absurd The only certainty
well know is uncertainty no
matter where we are

ONA
Other than the certainty of the
power of love

Salome turns to face Ona directly

SALOME
Keep nonsense like that to
yourself Please

MEJAL
Why couldn’t that be the case that
the only certainty is the power of
love

SALOME
(shouting)
Because it’s meaningless
Especially in this fucking
situation

AGATA
(commanding)
Stop it Now I mean it

They are quiet Salome bites slivers off her fingernails and
eats them Mejal grimaces in disgust as Salome spits out the
nails

MEJAL
That is disgusting Truly

Neitje and Autje begin to braid their hair into one long
braid that connects them

AGATA
Neitje Autje Do you have
something to add to the list

NEITJE
We won’t have to leave the people
we love

GRETA
We could bring loved ones with us
if we leave

MEJAL
How What does that mean We move
the whole colony What can that
possibly mean

ONA
(gently)
Several of the people we love are
people we also fear

AGATA
We could create the possibility of
a new order right here in a place
that is familiar to us

SALOME
Not simply familiar A place that
is ours

MEJAL

Do we need to write the cons Isn’t
it obvious that we must stay and
fight

GRETA
Cons We won’t be forgiven

August writes CONS on the paper

MARICHE
We don’t know how to fight

SALOME
I know how to fight

The others ignore Salome

MARICHE
We don’t want to fight
GRETA
There is the risk that conditions
will be worse after fighting than
before

Ona raises her hand

ONA
May I speak

AUGUST
Please

ONA

Would it be a good idea before we
list the pros and cons of staying
and fighting to talk about exactly
what we are fighting for

SALOME
It’s obvious we’re fighting for
our safety and for our freedom from
attacks

ONA
Yes But what would that mean to
us Perhaps we need a statement
which describes what we want the
colony to be like after winning the
fight Perhaps we need to know more
about what we are fighting to
achieve not only what we are
fighting to destroy

MARICHE
Why don’t we talk about reality
instead

AGATA

Because our reality is an old one
And we are talking about creating a
new reality

Autje and Neitje put their heads down on the table miming
boredom and exasperation Neitje rests her head on her arm
Her voice is muffled

NEITJE
(plaintive)
Are we staying or going
AGATA
Ona Please tell us more about the
statement you are thinking about

ONA
Men and women will make all
decisions for the colony
collectively Women will be allowed
to think Girls will be taught to
read and write The schoolhouse
must display a map of the world so
that we can begin to understand our
place in it A new religion taken
from the old but focused on love
will be created by the women of the
colony

Mariche creases her brow dramatically

ONA (CONTD)
Our children will be safe

Greta has closed her eyes and is smiling

GRETA
“Collectively” You sound like
August’s mother

August looks up He and Ona look at each other

MARICHE
Ona You are a dreamer

ONA

(calmly)
We are women without a voice We
have nothing to return to Even the
animals of the colony are safer in
their homes than we women are All
we have are our dreams So of
course we are dreamers

Mariche scoffs

MARICHE
Would you like to hear my dream I
dream that people who speak
nonsense who have no grasp on
reality are not put in charge of
making statements

Ona smiles with genuine appreciation Agata clears
throat

her

Buff Rev 24

AGATA
The statement Ona described sounds
good to me We can add to it over
time For now it will declare what
we women see as the future of the
colony whether we are here or
elsewhere Are we agreed

Greta raises her arms into the air The women nod some half-
heartedly Neitje’s eyes roll in their sockets as her head
snaps back and her jaw drops open Autje laughs Greta
shushes her Ona opens a window Neitje walks over to the
packing paper pulling Autje along with her with their braids
still attached and begins to draw illustrations beside
August’s words

GRETA
What will happen if the men refuse
to meet our demands

ONA
We will kill them

Autje and Neitje gasp And then smile tentatively Autje puts
her face in her hands trying not to laugh Neitje jabs her
with her elbow to make her stop Mejal perturbed takes out
her tobacco and rolling papers Agata stands up and puts her
arms around Ona

AGATA
(whispering)
No Ona No

Agata looks at the others while she gently cradles her
daughter

AGATA (CONTD)
She is only joking

Salome shrugs

SALOME
Maybe not

Agata pokes Salome in the shoulder Neitje draws a woman
killing a man

MARICHE
What if the men who are in prison
are not guilty

AUTJE
Mother
Buff Rev MARICHE
Yes I know Autje

AUTJE
Then why are you asking-

NEITJE

We caught one of them I saw him

FLASHBACK TO

23 EXT NEITJE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT - TWO WEEKS AGO 23

A din like a roar Neitje waits by her bedroom window Autje
behind her They hears something and Neitje sticks her head
out of her bedroom window She sees a YOUNG MAN creeping up
a ladder a LARGE SPRAY CAN in his hands He looks back up at
her She screams Autje does too He scrambles down the

ladder
ONA (VO)
Only one
SALOME (VO)
Yes Only one But he named the
others
CUT BACK TO
24 INT HAYLOFT - AFTERNOON 24

MARICHE
But what if he was lying

There is silence for a while

SALOME
But the point-

Mariche sighs

MARICHE
We must consider this

SALOME
No That is not our responsibility
Because we aren’t in charge of
whether or not they are punished
We know that we’ve been attacked by
men and not by ghosts or Satan as
we were led to believe for so long
We know we have not imagined these
attacks that we were made
unconscious with cow tranquilizer
We know that we are bruised and
infected and pregnant and terrified
and insane and some of us are dead
We know that we must protect our
children Regardless of who is
guilty

AGATA
Alright Salome thank you please
sit down
Goldenrod Rev 26

She tugs on Salome’s sleeve Agata takes a breath and strokes
Salome’s hair and gently urges her back to the milk bucket
She murmurs words to her as she sits beside her calming her
stroking her hair Neitje draws two braids ( like hers and
Autje’s) intertwined

AGATA (CONTD)
Shall we move on

MARICHE
But if there is any chance that the
men in prison are innocent
shouldn’t we be joining forces to
secure their freedom

ONA
It is possible that the men in
prison are not guilty of the
attacks But are they guilty of not
stopping the attacks Are they
guilty of knowing about the attacks
and doing nothing

MARICHE
How should we know what they’re
guilty of or not

ONA
But we do know We do know that the
conditions have been created by men
and that these attacks have been
made possible because of the
circumstances of the colony And
those circumstances have been
created and ordained by the men

MARICHE
But wait aren’t you suggesting
that the attackers are as much
victims as the victims of the
attacks That all of us men and
women are victims of the
circumstances from which the colony
has been created

Ona is quiet for a long time

ONA
In a sense yes

MARICHE
So then even if the court finds
them guilty or innocent they are
after all innocent
Double Blue Rev ONA
Yes I would say so

MEJAL
The elders called them evil

ONA
But that’s not true

SALOME
It’s the elder’s quest for power
that is responsible

ONA
Yes because they needed to have
those-

SALOME

Those they’d have power over

MEJAL
And those people are us

AGATA
And they have taught this lesson of
power to the boys and men of the
colony and the boys and men have
been excellent students

MEJAL
But don’t we all want some type of
power

ONA

Yes I think so But I’m not sure

AGATA
The only thing we can be sure of is
that time is disappearing

AUTJE
But we caught them We caught
them

SALOME
Yes

MARICHE

Yes you did

The women look at the girls somewhat in awe

Double Blue Rev 27A

AUTJE
Then why are you making it so
complicated

NEITJE
(to herself)
It’s very very boring

ONA
We could ask the men to leave

MEJAL
Is that a joke

SALOME
Are you crazy Ona

Agata puts her hand on her chest

AGATA
No no
GRETA
Ask the men to leave

AGATA
None of us have ever asked the men
for anything Not a single thing
not even for the salt to be passed
not even for a penny or a moment
alone or to take the washing in or
to open a curtain or to go easy on
the small yearlings or to put your
hand on the small of my back as I
try again for the twelfth or
thirteenth time to push a baby out
of my body Isn’t it interesting
that the one and only request we
women would have of the men would
be to leave

The Women break out laughing They can’t stop When one stops

for a moment they quickly resume laughing in a loud burst
setting everyone else off It is contagious and out of

control Finally Agata calms

AGATA (CONTD)
It’s not an option They wouldn’t
leave

The others agree saying “No”

GRETA
Asking the men to leave is not an
option I’d like you to imagine
Ruth and Cheryl-

AGATA
Oh no not again

Ona has not stopped laughing
ONA

Please stop I’m afraid I’1l go
into labour

They laugh harder Mariche tries not to laugh but looking at

August makes her splutter

MARICHE
Look August is still taking the
minutes

This sets them off into new hysterics August watches Ona as

she laughs Agata slaps August on the back
Buff Rev 29

AGATA
You must think we’re all lunatics

AUGUST
I don’t And it doesn’t matter what
I think anyway

ONA
Do you think that’s true That it
doesn’t matter what you think

August blushes

ONA (CONTD)

How would you feel if in your
entire lifetime it had never
mattered what you thought

AUGUST

But I’m not here to think I’m here
to take the minutes of your
meeting

ONA

But if in all your life you truly
felt that it didn’t matter what you
thought how would that make you
feel

August considers this So do The Women Ona looks around a
new thought occurring to her

ONA (CONTD)
When we have liberated ourselves
we will have to ask ourselves who
we are

They sit in silence Neitje draws a picture of the women
laughing

Neitje and Autje are stifling giggles Mejal plays with the
smoke in her hand Salome stares wistfully out of the South-
facing door towards the hills past the soy fields WE
FOLLOW HER GAZE out the window traveling past the women A
long pause as we look in silence at the landscape MIEP in the field plays with a strand of grass looks up at the
sky

SALOME
Will we be done by suppertime I
have to give little Miep her
antibiotics

Goldenrod Rev 30

GRETA
Where did you get antibiotics

AGATA
She walked She walked for a day
and a half to the mobile klinic
With Miep on her back

Agata stays perfectly still after mentioning Miep mouthing
the words to a verse from Psalms She is very still
predatory Everyone is silent at the mention of Miep

CUT TO

EXT ROAD - MAGIC HOUR - TWO WEEKS EARLIER 25

VERY WIDE on Salome looking exhausted small in the
distance She walks down a long dusty road We stay close on
her profile occasionally moving back to see the face of her
sleeping daughter resting on her shoulders We see them from
behind as they become specks on the crest of the hill in the
distance

We hear Agata’s voice almost a whisper softly praying

AGATA (VO)
The Lord is gracious and
compassionate slow to anger rich
in loving kindness and forgiveness

CUT BACK TO

INT HAYLOFT - EARLY AFTERNOON 26

SALOME
I have to hide the antibiotics in
Miep’s apple sauce or she won’t
swallow them

The Women nod Agata remains perfectly still mouthing the
words to the prayer

AGATA
The Lord is gracious and
compassionate slow to anger rich
in loving kindness and forgiveness

Greta goes over to Agata and pulls up a stool beside her She
takes Agata’s hand and joins her in the recitation

Cherry Rev 31

AGATAGRETA
The Lord is gracious and
compassionate slow to anger rich
in loving kindness and forgiveness

August looks around at the silent women Greta opens and
closes her eyes Mariche comes over and sits beside her and
strokes her hand

GRETA
I’m not crying I’m moisturizing

Agata begins to sing The other women join hands and sing
Ona harmonizes beautifully Neitje and Autje roll their eyes
and shake their heads

THE WOMEN
Work for the night is coming
Work through the morning hours
Work while the dew is sparkling
Work ‘mid springing flowers

Greta winces and she removes her false teeth again She puts
them down on the plywood

GRETA
(whispering to Mejal)
Forgive me They are too big for my
mouth

Mariche stares at the teeth on the plywood The hymn
continues over

FLASHBACK TO

INT GRETA’S BEDROOM - DAWN - ONE YEAR EARLIER 27

Greta opens her mouth blood comes out She looks down at her
hand which has her bloody teeth in it

CUT BACK TO

INT HAYLOFT - EARLY AFTERNOON 28

Neitje and Autje look mortified by the singing and look
downwards Greta puts her teeth back in and walks over to
Autje and pats her hand encourages her to sing Autje
reluctantly obliges

Tan Rev 32

AGATA
Well Let’s take a break

Autje slips down the ladder and out of the hayloft We watch
The Women slip down the ladder one by one A few continue to
hum the hymn which we hear over the next few scenes

EXT PADDOCK - MID-AFTERNOON 29

Neitje braids Autje’s hair

EXT BARN - MID-AFTERNOON 30

Mejal lights up a cigarette leaning on the fence She stares
up at the barn Then she looks out toward the field where she
sees in the distance the CHILDREN playing tag in the soy
fields MELVINNETTIE is watching over the children Autje
joins Mejal much to her chagrin They keep watching
MELVINNETTIE

MEJAL
Don’t say a word about my smoking
Honestly

AUTJE
Is she always going to be like this
now

MEJAL
Like what

AUTJE
Like a man Is Nettie always going
to be a man now

MEJAL
I think she always felt she wasn’t
a woman What happened to her just
made itfinal

EXT SHED - MORNING - FIVE DAYS EARLIER 33

MelvinNettie still covered in blood but silent now sits
with his back to the shed He speaks without looking back
between the slats where we see pieces of the men inside

NETTIEMELVIN
Is my brother listening
MAN
He is
NETTIEMELVIN

Hello little brother I don’t know
if it was your baby or one of your
friends But I think it was likely
yours Because there was something
wrong with it Small as a bun but
with everything intact I loved it
I think Isn’t that strange I
won’t speak of it or anything
else Ever again

Slowly NettieMelvin gets up and walks away a resolve on
his face

NettieMelvin bandages a cut on a LITTLE GIRL’S knee Mejal
and Autje continue to watch

AUTJE
But-

MEJAL
But what

AUTJE

She doesn’t speak anymore

MEJAL
She speaks to the children I think
they call her Melvin

Mejal shrugs Mejal stomps out her cigarette Autje stares at
it

MEJAL (CONTD)
I mean it Not one word about my
smoking

Autje walks off

EXT BARN - AFTERNOON 35

Autje walks to the pump with a pail and pumps it vigorously
August sits nearby looking out at the fields He stands up
awkwardly They are silent for a time August clears his
throat

AUGUST
You know during the second world
war in Italy civilians would hide
in bomb shelters Volunteers were
needed to power the generators that
provided electricity They rode
bikes When you were swinging from
the rafter earlier it reminded me
of this You would have been the
perfect volunteer If we were in a
bomb shelter

AUTJE
Where would I ride the bike to in
such a small space

AUGUST
Ah yes Well the bike would be
stationary

Autje smiles and ponders this for a moment

AUTJE
I have to get the water to the
yearlings

She looks back at him smiles

AUTJE (CONTD)
Watch this

She swings the pail of water around in a complete circle
without spilling a drop August smiles awkwardly

AUTJE (CONTD)
I’1l bet you didn’t learn how to do
things like that when you went to
University
Salmon Rev August shakes his head

AUTJE (CONTD)
Only facts about stationary
bicycles in far off places

August looks down nods

AUTJE (CONTD)
I suppose I shouldn’t be too sad
then That I won’t ever go

They look at each other for a long moment trying to read
each other

AUTJE (CONTD)
Why were you forced to leave

AUGUST
My mother questioned things

AUTJE
She questioned God

AUGUST
Not God Power The rules that are
made in the name of God She
encouraged others to question
things too

AUTJE
Like Aunt Ona

AUGUST
Yes Ona knew her well

AUTJE
Did she die

August nods

AUGUST
But sometimes listening to all of
you speaking today I can hear her
so clearly

AUTJE
Why did the elders let you come
back

AUGUST

I went to university So I could
serve a purpose and teach the boys

Salmon Rev 35A

AUTJE
Too late

There is a silence

36A

Goldenrod Rev 36

AUGUST
I want to help And I don’t know
how
Autje shrugs
AUTJE

You came back for Aunt Ona didn’t
you The way you look at her is
funny I don’t know why she won’t
just marry you You both say so
much that doesn’t make sense

Autje breaks the gaze and runs to the horses

INT MARICHE’S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON 36

We hear over the next few scenes a distant sound of a
megaphone and a truck rolling by The sound of “California
Dreaming” coming out of a tinny truck radio gets louder as
Mariche tends to her many children (There are 8 of them)

Mariche looks up unsettled
LOUDSPEAKER (0S)
I am here to collect data for the
2010 census
Mariche ignores it She redirects the children who are
fascinated and going towards the windows to look for the
source of the foreign sound and see the truck going by

EXT MARICHE’S HOUSE 36A

The census truck goes by the house and down the road

INT GRETA’S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON 37

is still

EXT CHICKEN COOP - AFTERNOON 40

Agata collects eggs She looks up as she hears the voice
booming nearby She pays little attention

INT GRETA’S HORSE BARN - AFTERNOON 41

Autje pours water into the horses’ trough while Neitje feeds
hay to Ruth and Cheryl A wooden trailer loaded with hay
bales sits near the barn

Autje and Neitje hear the Census Truck approach They turn
watching the truck stop by the side of the road They look at
each other and smile then leave the pail and hay behind as
they gravitate towards the music

EXT WASHHOUSE LATE AFTERNOON 42

Mejal sits under laundry light pouring through white
dresses She braids one of her daughters’ hair tightly as
other children play around her and another daughter washes clothes in an outdoor sink She hears the loudspeaker
and similarly ignores it

INT HAYLOFT - LATE AFTERNOON 43

August sees out the East Barn doors in the distance the
truck stopped Autje and Neitje approach it They stand
there listening “California Dreaming” still plays out of
the radio The girls are looking into the driver’s side of
the truck bopping ever so slightly to the music We see the
drivers face in the side mirror the girls in the foreground
We don’t hear their words but it is clear they are flirting
and so is he Eventually the truck drives away “California
Dreaming” continues to play over

INT HAYLOFT - LATE AFTERNOON 44

August is in the hayloft alone He looks at the empty milk
pails the hay bales a small bird flying in the rafters It
feels empty without the women here He sings “California
Dreaming” faintly to himself
Green Rev 37A

He hears a gentle clatter as the Women all make their way
back up the ladder with food baskets They take their
places murmuring to each other serving each other food and
instant coffee
Cherry Rev 38

Neitje slowly and subtly opens the large barn doors facing
East A few of the women notice and give her a curious look
Mariche has brought with her a pair of men’s overalls to
mend Salome looks around as she and Mejal serve coffee to
the group Ona brings coffee to August

SALOME
Where is Autje

Neitje shrugs silently and sits down

AGATA
Well We must begin without her

Salome looks at Mejal who sits beside her

SALOME
Were you smoking

MEJAL

Is that any of your business
GRETA

Please
AGATA

We must decide this afternoon about
staying or leaving

Suddenly Autje climbs the ladder We hear HYSTERICAL MOANS
before we see Autje appear at the top of the ladder

AUTJE
I can’t live a second longer Life
is too cruel

Autje sways and moans then runs to the window and FLINGS
HERSELF OUT THE WINDOW headfirst

The WOMEN SCREAM They all sprint and hobble to the window
to find Autje sitting placidly atop a stack of hay bales on a
flatbed truck which has been positioned just under the
window Neitje laughs uncontrollably

MARICHE
Autje Wait until I get ahold of
you

GRETA

I could have had a heart attack

Ona laughs hard in appreciation while the others shake their
heads and strive to contain any sign of approval
Cherry Rev 38A

Mejal tries hard to contain her laughter but keeps
sputtering which makes Ona and the younger women laugh even
harder Mariche does not look amused
Cherry Rev 39

When it dies down Autje looks around at all of the women
her face serious

AUTJE
Excuse me Excuse me The Census
taker just told us that one of our
men is planning to return late
tonight He is coming to get some
old horses to auction

GRETA
Ruth and Cheryl

NEITJE
They need more bail money for the
attackers

Greta lifts her arms into the air She stumbles back to her
seat Agata sharpens her gaze They all clamber hastily back
to their seats for the meeting Autje climbs back up into the
hayloft and takes her seat as well

MARICHE
Tonight

Autje nods

MARICHE (CONTD)
Which man

AUTJE NEITJE
Father Your Klaas

Mariche makes the smallest of small sounds

MARICHE
(quietly trying to absorb
this)
Oh

AGATA
So Time is of the essence
Everyone get back to your seats
Cherry Rev 40

The Women ALL TALK AT ONCE in an uproar August struggles to
write to keep notes of all they are saying in the din of
noise Ona looks at August He looks down at what he has
written It says “Talking at once All talking at once” He
clears his throat out of nervousness Mariche glares at him

MARICHE
Are you trying to call us to order

AUGUST
No No Please forgive me

MARICHE
Why are you here Why is my
presence questioned when there is a
man-

GRETA
Pros for leaving

August writes “LEAVING” on the brown paper Neitje and Autje
post up what he has written so far Neitje adds more
illustrations of the women the men the boys Autje puts up
her hand

MEJAL
(half-heartedly)
We will be gone

GRETA
We will be safe

MARICHE
Perhaps not But the first is most
definitely a fact that if we leave
we will be gone

Mariche looks around at the group

MARICHE (CONTD)
Do we really have time to state the
obvious over and over

Mejal rolls her eyes

GRETA
Add to the list this We will not
be asked to forgive the men
because we will not be here to hear
the question

AGATA
Yes Autje
Pink Rev 41

AUTJE
We will see a bit of the world

There is silence August seeing no one else is speaking
begins to write on a new piece of paper Neitje and Autje get
back to rebraiding their hair together

AUGUST
Let’s move on to the Cons of
Leaving

MARICHE

We the women will decide what
happens in these meetings Not a
two-bit failed farmer who must
teach You have been invited here
You have been invited here to
listen to what we have to say and
to write it down Nothing more
Just Listen

Greta erupts She stands up shouting

GRETA
Mariche Klaas is returning soon
and you are wasting time Klaas
will return to your home for just
long enough to take his animals in
order to sell for bail money that
will see the rapists return to the
colony and he will lay his hands on
you and on your children and you
as always do nothing but fire
away at us all like a Gatling gun
with your misdirected rage What
good does that do

The Women are silent Mariche is shaking staring at her
mother

AUGUST
I would like to apologize for
wrongly attempting to nudge the
proceedings That is not my place

The Women say nothing Mejal watching August lets out a
burst of laughter

GRETA
Mejal

MEJAL
I’1l stop

NEITJE
We don’t have a map We don’t know
where to go

Autje and Neitje sway back and forth a gentle tug of war
with the braid that connects them

AUTJE
(laughing)
We don’t even know where we are

The girls laugh together

Miep Salome’s daughter climbs up the ladder to the loft
Greta turns to Neitje and Autje

GRETA
Hush Put your hair away

The girls untangle their braids Miep looks frightened and
goes to her mother She snuggles in to her

MIEP
I hurt

Agata watches Miep trying to contain her grief August looks
down Salome holds Miep and strokes her hair whispering to
her kissing her Miep has buried her face in her mothers
lap We hear but don’t see her cry Ona puts her arm around
Salome’s shoulder as she holds Miep

GRETA
(watching Miep almost to
herself)
There are no Cons of Leaving

Ona looks up at Greta then back down to Miep and nods
gently Neitje draws a picture of Miep sleeping on the
butcher paper beneath August’s words

NettieMelvin climbs the ladder and appears She mimes that
he is sorry for the interruption

AGATA
Not to worry Nettie

Agata begins to sing “Children of the Heavenly Father” and
the other women join in Autje and Neitje roll their eyes as
the other women’s voices soar Miep snuggles into her mother
Ona smiles at August He smiles back August looks down
closes his eyes and listens to their voices

Blue Rev 43

He stares at Miep who is drifting to sleep as the singing
drifts to humming

MARICHE
If we do leave the colony how will
we live with the pain of not seeing
our brothers and our sons again
The men

FLASHBACK TO

INT SCHOOLHOUSE - MORNING 45

August looks out at the faces of his students his young men
Some look up at him attentively Some laugh and roll their
eyes at him We track along their faces slowly getting to
know the pores of the skin of each one of these young boys

GRETA (VO)
Time will heal Our freedom and
safety are the ultimate goals and
it is men who prevent us from
achieving those goals

MARICHE (VO)
But not all men

ONA (VO)
Perhaps not men but a way of
seeing the world and us women
that has been allowed to take hold
of men’s hearts and minds

NEITJE (VO)
So if we leave if we leave I
will never see my brothers again

AUTJE (VO)
Who will take care of them Of them
all

CUT BACK TO

INT HAYLOFT - LATE AFTERNOON 46

Neitje and Autje look suddenly full of grief This hangs in
the air They are all lost in their own thoughts Miep lies
sleeping in Salome’s arms

Double Pink Rev 44

GRETA
We can’t know if we will stay or
leave before we resolve these last-
minute concerns

ONA
I wouldn’t call the future of our
relationships with the boys and men
we love “last-minute concerns”

Ona glances in August’s direction He catches it He looks
out the window at the sun getting lower in the sky Cows can
be heard mooing in the distance Dogs are barking for their
dinner

The women watch Miep as she falls asleep in Salome’s arms We
hold close on each woman’s face watching Miep sleep and we
feel the lowering light move across each of their faces
Neitje draws pictures of the boys on the packing paper The
light dims over the images as she draws them

EXT FIELD - MAGIC HOUR 47
We see the sun lower in the sky We hear a cow moo We hear

INT HAYLOFT - MAGIC HOUR 48
CLOSE ON Miep sleeping MelvinNettie gently picks her up
out of Salome’s arms and takes her out of the hayloft The

Women watch in silence as she is taken down the ladder

ONA
I need some water

She goes down the ladder and outside August follows her
awkwardly The women watch in silence and then laugh as soon
as he is down the ladder

EXT FIELD - MAGIC HOUR 49
MelvinNettie watches the children play while cradling Miep
still sleeping in his arms He looks down at her tenderly
EXT PUMP - MAGIC HOUR 50

behind He pumps water into a bucket looks around for
something to pour it into

Double Pink Rev 44a

He cups water into his hands for her to drink from She
pauses for a moment and then drinks from his hands He takes
another scoop of water and she takes another drink She wipes
her mouth and holds her stomach Children play in the
background
Blue Rev 45

They stand close together staring at each other in silence
for a long time Tears appear in August’s eyes Ona quickly
wipes them off his cheek August turns away ashamed

They are silent Ona goes to speak and then stops herself
She holds his gaze for a long time She puts her hand lightly
on his face

ONA
It’s good to have you with us
August To remind us of what is
possible Because it’s easy to
forget

Ona holds her stomach feeling ill

AUGUST
I am so sorry Ona

ONA
One day I would like to hear those
words from someone who should be
saying them

Ona looks out across the field towards where the children are
playing

ONA (CONTD)
Why does love the absence of
love the end of love the need for
love result in so much violence

AUGUST
Ona

Ona shakes her head
AUGUST (CONTD)

Ona I could take care of you and
your child I want to I-

Cherry Rev 46

He stops himself

ONA
I know August You don’t have to
say the words

They are silent for a while

ONA (CONTD)
If I were married I would not be
myself And so the person you love
would be gone

AUGUST
Your child-

ONA
If we stay and don’t win the fight
my child will be given to another
family here Maybe even to the
family of my attacker If we stay
and we don’t win the fight

AUGUST
You won’t let that happen

ONA
No No I won’t

August nods Ona is silent for a long time processing
something August nods understanding that she is coming to a
decision Ona nods and walks away determination in her
steps

INT HAYLOFT - MAGIC HOUR 51

Shadows fall now across the women’s faces Agata and Salome
light lanterns Neitje and Autje are still conjoined by the
hair Neitje has drawn a picture of a woman leaving towards a
buggy and reaching out for her son who is behind her August
and Ona enter

GRETA
August We want to discuss options
for the men and the older boys if
the women decide to leave

SALOME
Which is a waste of time because we
are not leaving
Salmon Rev 47

August takes up his pen and begins recording their
conversation

MARICHE
The men should be allowed to leave
with the women if they wish

Salome laughs So does Mejal

MEJAL
Then what on earth is the point of
us leaving

GRETA
They could be allowed to join the
women later when the women have
established themselves and are
thriving

AUGUST
(writing it down)
Should we add thriving as a
collective literate community

MARICHE
Literate is your word Not ours We
don’t need your university language
to make our plans

August nods continues to write

AGATA
Put it in We know what it means
Continue

GRETA
Young boys simple minded boys of
any age Cornelius who is confined
to a wheelchair will accompany the
women

August writes quickly The Women stare at August and at the
document that they can’t read

MARICHE
I vote for the first option They
should leave with us if they wish

There is a din of noise as all The Women object to this
Mariche crosses her arms
Yellow Rev MEJAL
The first option is ridiculous and
should be crossed off the list

Mejal rolls a cigarette between her fingers as she speaks

MARICHE
Why are some ideas written down and
considered and others crossed out

MARICHE (CONTD)
(to herself)
I want to leave

She throws the dregs of her coffee to the floor

MARICHE (CONTD)
Id like to strangle myself

ONA
But Mariche it’s possible that all
the men would choose to leave with
us Then all wed be doing is re-
creating our colony with all of
its dangers elsewhere wherever we
end up

AGATA
And the men would most definitely
leave with us because they can’t
survive without us

Greta laughs

GRETA
Well not for longer than a day or
two

SALOME

There is no possibility of the men
leaving with us Whatever we
decide And we have not decided to
leave I would like to remind
everyone of that

Mejal is openly smoking now Salome looks irritated Mejal
makes a big show of waving the smoke away from Salome

Cherry Rev 49

AGATA
Clearly these are unrealistic
ideas And how are we to leave at
all if we have never been allowed
to even see a map of the world

AUGUST
I can secure a world map for you

The Women looked shocked

AGATA
Where on earth would you get a map
August

AUGUST
I also have a map of this specific
region

GRETA

That will do We aren’t planning to
travel the planet

ONA
Perhaps we are Did you know that
the migration period of butterflies
and dragonflies is so long that it
is often only the grandchildren who
arrive at the intended destination

August watches Ona admiringly Autje and Neitje try to
suppress laughing at Ona Mejal nods Ona looks straight at
August now Some of The Women nod and ponder this

AUGUST
So Yes so

The Women laugh

ONA
Perhaps if we went beyond where
the map shows us we could create
our own map as we go
Green Rev 50

The Women turn their attention to her mystified

GRETA
Now that is a unique idea

SALOME
So now you want to leave Ona

The sisters look at each other for a long moment
Ona suddenly vomits into the milk pail beside her

GRETA
Oh

Agata brings her legs down from the milk pail they have been
resting upon and walks to Ona She strokes her back and pulls
the loose strands of hair from her forehead into the
kerchief

ONA
I’m fine

Ona looks at Salome
Mejal begins to breathe heavily Her hand is on her chest

GRETA
What now

AGATA
Are you alright Mejal

Mejal nods her head vigorously

SALOME
She’s having one of her episodes

Salome goes to Mejal She holds her hand and whispers softly
in her ear Greta indicates to The Women to pray The Women
bow their heads

GRETA
Please God Restore Mejal’s
equilibrium

Mejal rocks on her milk pail Salome positions herself behind
her ready to catch her as she tumbles off her fall broken
by Salome’s arms Mejal lies in the straw her body quite
rigid Salome lies down beside her and continues to whisper
inaudibly into her ear and to hold her

INT MEJAL’S ROOM - MORNING - ONE YEAR EARLIER 52

ON MEJAL’S LOWER LEGS as she stands up out of bed Blood
drips to the floor ON MEJAL’S FACE as she looks down
hearing the blood droplets hit the floor with what sounds
like a CRASH Mejal is quiet for a long time Then she begins
to scream a primal animal scream which continues over

Agata’s prayer

AGATA (VO)
Almighty Father in all humility
and supplication we ask Thee for
Thy abundant kindness this moment

AGATA (VO) (CONTD)
We beseech Thee have mercy on our

Salome continues to hold Mejal

AGATA
Please in your beneficence heal

envelop her in your strength and
everlasting love and please drive
out the sickness that afflicts her
now

CUT BACK TO

The Women continue to bow their heads they are holding hands
now Salome has discreetly covered Mejal’s ears Salome looks

up at Ona

SALOME
(whispering)
Take the cigarette out of her
pocket

Ona reaches into Mejal’s pocket and fishes out a cigarette
Mejal smells the smoke that Salome is putting underneath her
nose She rouses She takes a deep breath

They help her back to her place at the table They are all

MEJAL
Alright Help me up

silent for a while watching Mejal closely trying to
recalibrate

AGATA
Praise be to God

MARICHE
Why is it only Mejal who has these
sudden-

SALOME
Be quiet

MARICHE
We were all attacked Not all of us
draw so much attention to
ourselves
Cherry Rev 52

MEJAL
Attention What attention I talk
less than all of you put together
How have I offended you

MARICHE
You have these “attacks” You
smoke Why Why is it so much
harder for you than for us We were
all attacked All of us And the
rest of us are all able to get
through a day without-

GRETA
We are wasting time by passing this
burden this sack of stones from
one to the next by pushing our
pain away We mustn’t do this We
mustn’t play hot potato with our
pain Let’s absorb it ourselves
each of us Let’s inhale it let’s
digest it let’s process it into
fuel

Mejal opens her mouth several times to speak

GRETA (CONTD)
Speak Mejal We are listening

MEJAL
They made usthey made us
disbelieve ourselves That was
worse than

They are all silent for a long time Salome catches her own
tears and then Mejal’s Mariche looks away Salome kneels in
front of Mejal She touches her hair tenderly

SALOME
Mejal

GRETA
Perhaps Mejal’s episode was brought
on by the thought of us creating
our own map

NEITJE
But I will draw it if we need-
Cherry Rev GRETA
Not a fear of the do-it-yourself
map making But of what it means
that we are masters of our own
destiny That we would be setting
off into unknowable space

AGATA
Yes It makes sense that one would
panic

Mejal blows smoke rings

MEJAL
I am not panicking

AGATA
Yes But panic in this case would
be understandable

MEJAL
But I’m not

ONA
Klaas when he returns may take
horses or livestock that we will
need along the way

SALOME
Along the way We’re not leaving
You are changing your mind Ona

Ona takes a deep breath and looks at her sister

ONA
I don’t believe that is a sin is
it

Salome puts her head in her hands
MARICHE
How will we be forgiven for all

this
(MORE)
Cherry Rev 54

MARICHE (CONTD)
How will we be forgiven if not by
the elders whom we have disobeyed
and who if we leave we will never
see again It will leave us
unforgiven with black hearts and
unable to enter the kingdom of god

GRETA
Perhaps there will be other elders
or men of God that will be able to
forgive us our sins Ones we
haven’t met yet

SALOME
We do not have to be forgiven by
the men of God for protecting our
children from the depraved actions
of vicious men who are often the
very same men we are meant to ask
for forgiveness If God in the
book of Matthew asks Let the
children come to me and do not
hinder them then mustn’t we
consider it a hindrance when our
children are attacked If God is a
loving God He will forgive us
Himself If God is a vengeful God
then He has created us in His
image If God is omnipotent then
why has He not protected the women
and girls of this colony I will
destroy any living thing that harms
my child I will tear it limb from
limb I will desecrate its body and
I will bury it alive I will
challenge God on the spot to strike
me dead if I have sinned by
protecting my child from evil and
by destroying the evil that it may
not harm another I will lie I
will hunt I will kill and I will
dance on graves and burn forever in
hell before I allow another man to
satisfy his violent urges with the
body of my four-year-old child

Ona moves to her sister and hugs her

AGATA
(softly)
No Not dancing Not desecration

Mejal goes to Salome and takes her in her arms Neitje draws
Salome dancing on a grave
Cherry Rev 55

MEJAL
Salome

She holds out her cigarette for Salome to take a drag

AGATA
I suggest that we think of what is
good “Whatever is true whatever
is honourable whatever is just
whatever is pure whatever is
pleasing whatever is commendable
if there is any excellence and if
there is anything worthy of praise
think about these things and the
peace of God be with you”

The women bow their heads and say the words along with Agata
Salome stays quiet thinking intently and breathing hard

THE WOMEN
Whatever is true whatever is
honourable whatever is just
whatever is pure whatever is
pleasing whatever is commendable
if there is anything worthy of
praise think about these things
and the peace of God be with you

Salome looks at her mother vulnerable

SALOME
I will become a murderer if I stay
What is worse than that

Agata nods There is silence for a long time as the women
watch Salome closely Agata gets up she walks to the window
stares out at the sunset Salome looks down Mariche paces
The women recite the verse again mostly to themselves As
the women recite the verse Ona walks over to where August
sits writing to catch up She peers over his shoulder She
points at the letters

ONA
I know what these are These are
letters But what are these

AUGUST
They are commas They signify a
short pause or a breath in the
text

Ona smiles then inhales
Tan Rev AUGUST (CONTD)
There is also a butterfly called
the comma

ONA
Is that so

Mariche rolls her eyes

AUGUST
Yes It’s called the comma because-

ONA
No Let me guess Because it flits
about from leaves to petals only
briefly stopping on its way
Because its journey is its story
never stopping only pausing only
moving

August smiles and nods Ona punches the palm of her hand in

victory

She goes back to her seat Finally Agata turns from the

ONA (CONTD)
Aha

window and walks slowly back to her seat

AGATA
Salome there is nothing worse than
being a murderer If you will
become a murderer by staying in the
colony side by side with the men
who are responsible for the attacks
then you must to protect your own
soul and to qualify for entry to
heaven leave the colony

Mariche frowns

MARICHE
We are not all murderers

ONA
Not yet

Ona looks at her mother
Tan Rev 57

AGATA
I have done what the verse from
Philippians instructed which is to
think about what is good what is
just what is pure and what is
excellent And I have arrived at an
answer Pacifism Pacifism is good
Any violence is unjustifiable
By staying here we women would be
betraying the central tenet of our
faith which is pacifism because
by staying we would knowingly be
placing ourselves in a direct
collision course with violence
either by us or against us

Agata holds back tears

AGATA (CONTD)
This colony is the only home I’ve
ever known and I don’t want to
leave But by staying we would be
inviting harm We would be in a
state of war We would turn this
colony into a battlefield

ONA
We cannot become murderers And we
cannot endure any more violence
That is why we must leave

All the women watch Salome as she nods her head gently Greta
raises her arms Mariche makes a noise of objection Mejal
takes a long haul off her cigarette She exhales and nods

MEJAL
Let’s shake a leg then

Ona suddenly feels a kick which startles her She puts her
hand to her belly Mariche looks up

ONA
I’m also thinking about the verse
from Philippians and I’m thinking
about what is good Freedom is
good It’s better than slavery And
forgiveness is good Better than
revenge And hope for the unknown
is good better than hatred of the
familiar

MARICHE
What about security and safety and
home and family

(MORE )

Salmon Rev 58

MARICHE (CONTD)
What about marriage and love

ONA
I don’t know about those things
any of them Except for love And
even love is mysterious to me And
I believe that my home is with my
mother with my sister and with my
unborn child wherever they may be

Ona touches her belly lightly Mariche stares at Ona’s
pregnant belly

MARICHE
Will you not hate that child That
child is the child of a man who
inspires violent thoughts in you

FLASHBACK TO

INT ONA’S BEDROOM - SUNRISE - 7 MONTHS EARLIER 54

Ona wakes up she can barely move her arms and legs She
looks down sees blood stains on the bed A din like a roar
again

ONA

Agata rushes in She looks around at the bed and clasps Ona
to her

ONA (VO)
I already love this child more than
anything
CUT BACK TO
INT HAYLOFT - TWILIGHT 55

Ona speaks clearly and calmly

ONA
He or she is as innocent and
lovable as the evening sun
And so too was the child’s father
when he was born

Agata makes a small noise
Agata shakes her head Salome looks at her closely

Cherry Rev ONA (CONTD)
Are you crying

strokes her head

MARICHE
(to Ona)
If you are saying that forgiveness
is better than revenge aren’t you
saying that we must stay here and
forgive the men

ONA
We cannot forgive because we are
forced to But if there is
distance perhaps I can begin to
understand how these crimes may
have occurred And maybe from that
distance I can pity these men and
perhaps forgive them And even love
them

Salome

A moment of silence as they absorb what Ona has said

Ona seems

AGATA
And so we must leave in order to
have that distance

ONA
Not fighting But moving on Always
moving Never fighting Just
moving

to be in some kind of trance

MARICHE
Snap out of it

SALOME
You snap out of it Mariche

MEJAL
All of you snap out of it and

Mejal jabs at the window at the darkening sky outside They
stare for a moment at the coming night

GRETA
I want to tell another story about
Ruth and Cheryl

Several of The Women groan Neitje and Autje fall backwards
in boredom

CUT TO

EXT ROAD - MORNING 56

We see Greta looking far down the road in front of her
driving her horses forward as she rides in the buggy TIGHT
ON the back of the HORSE’S HEADS we see their direction
moving erratically then finding focus and going straight as
Greta speaks

GRETA (VO)
I was always frightened of the
northern road out of the colony So
many gullies on either side of the
road that are so deep And it’s so
narrow The buggy used to lurch
side to side Ruth and Cheryl were
simply following my commands on the
reins but they were jerky and
frenetic It was dangerous It was
only when I learned to focus my
gaze far down ahead of me down the
road and not on the road
immediately in front of Ruth and
Cheryl that I started to feel safe

The buggy goes by the camera we CRANE UP to see Greta
getting smaller and smaller disappearing into the distance
the sun setting over the colony

GRETA (VO)
Leaving will give us the more far-
seeing perspective we need to
forgive

INT GRETA’S KITCHEN - MORNING 57

Greta sits with her one year old grandchild on her lap
feeding her porridge Every now and then she gives her a
little jostle making her laugh uproariously

GRETA (VO)
Which is to love properly and to
keep the peace according to our
faith

Goldenrod Rev 61

INT GRETA’S KITCHEN - MORNING 58

Greta plays a hide and seek game with her granddaughter
getting down on all fours and hiding behind doorways Greta
is childlike magical to her granddaughter

GRETA (VO)
Therefore our leaving wouldn’t be
an act of cowardice or abandonment
It wouldn’t be because we were
excommunicated or exiled It would
be a supreme act of faith a step
towards love and forgiveness

CUT BACK TO

INT HAYLOFT - TWILIGHT 59

The Women are silent considering this Neitje draws a buggy
way in the distance

GRETA
Leaving is how we demonstrate our
faith We are leaving because our
faith is stronger than the rules
Bigger than our life

This hangs in the air

Greta grimaces and moves her hand slowly in front of her
face

GRETA (CONTD)
I am sorry But I think I might be
dying

Some of The Women rise in alarm from their seats Mejal
looks directly into Greta’s eyes She laughs She removes
Greta’s eyeglasses and shows them to the group

MEJAL
Mother You are not dying Your
glasses need cleaning

Greta laughs relieved Mejal cleans her glasses on her dress
and hands them back to her

GRETA
I thought the lights were going
out
Buff Rev 62

Agata hoots The Women other than Mariche laugh and laugh
Agata struggles for breath Autje posts the picture of Ona
and her baby on the wall

MARICHE
What are you laughing at We can’t
leave It would be better to stay
and fight than leave

ONA
Do you really mean that you want to
stay and NOT fight Because when
was the last time you had the
strength to stand up to the
aggression of Klaas to protect
your children or to get out of
harms way

Mariche is enraged She rises ignoring Salome and looking at
Ona

MARICHE
Who are you to tell me what kind of
wife and mother to be when you are
neither one yourself You area
spinster a lunatic A whore An
unwed mother

August writes as fast as he can nervously watching Ona
Salome rises from her milk bucket

SALOME
Ona was made unconscious and raped
like the rest of us and now is
pregnant as a result How dare you
call her a whore Mariche are you
not afraid your own sweet boys will
become monsters like their father
because you do nothing to protect
them or yourself-

AUTJE
(softly)
Stop

SALOME
(Continuing without
stopping)
Nothing to educate them nothing to
teach them the horror of their
father’s ways the sickness

Greta lets out an involuntary laugh Mariche turns to face
Ona

MARICHE
How dare you pass judgement on me

Ona meets Mariche’s gaze

ONA
It wasn’t judgement It was a
question

Agata leans over to whisper to Ona

ONA (CONTD)
I am sorry Mariche I am sorry
that what I said hurt you

MARICHE
Fuck it off

Mejal laughs

GRETA
Sit down Mariche

Mejal and Salome share a cigarette Agata continues to stroke
Salome’s arms and hair

NEITJE
(whispering)
It’s “fuck off” I think

The others nod in agreement Autje and Neitje laugh Neitje
draws Mariche yelling at Ona pointing a finger

ONA
I am sorry I am saying sorry not
just to leave the hurt behind but
because I feel truly that I
should not have said something
harmful
Buff Rev 64

Mariche watches her somewhat calmed but still guarded and
waiting to pounce

ONA (CONTD)
And Mariche I am sorry because you
don’t need or deserve more harm

MARICHE
Who are any of you to pretend I
have had a choice

Mariche notices Autje who is watching her carefully

Autje nods softly

GRETA
I am also sorry Mariche

Mariche looks up at her mother quickly startled

GRETA (CONTD)

Because Mariche I couldn’t - I
didn’t try to protect you or your
children from Klaas All this time
And what you say is true You had
no choice You forgave him again
and again as you were told to As
I told you to

Mariche sits down taking in her mother’s words She looks
around at the group Salome looks up at her quickly then
looks away nodding in agreement with Greta tears in her

eyes Mariche speaks softly almost to herself

MARICHE
It is not only the men and boys who
have been excellent students

Mariche takes the overalls she has been sewing off her lap
and puts them to the side

SALOME
Yes All of us have been infected
by a poisoned way of thinking

MARICHE
And so you have judged me For what
I have endured

Agata nods gently looking at her Autje comes over to
Mariche and sits on the floor beside her puts her head in
her lap Mariche touches her hair softly
Buff Rev AGATA
I think Mariche I think that we
are all very sorry What you have
been required to endure with your
violent husband was a

64A
Double Pink Rev 65

GRETA
A misuse of forgiveness

MEJAL
Is there such a thing Is there a
forgiveness that is not good

AGATA
Perhaps forgiveness can in some
instances be confused with
permission

Mariche looks up to see her Mejal touches Mariche’s hand
Seeing their acknowledgement something in Mariche softens
She puts her head down She appears to be breathing fully
for the first time She stares at the floor

ONA
Perhaps it will also be a difficult
task to forgive each other and
ourselves after all that has
happened

Mariche nods at her mother tears in her eyes Greta holds
Mariche close

Suddenly NettieMelvin climbs the ladder holding Julius
Reimer Mariche’s son (5 years old) He looks stunned and
upset

GRETA
What in heaven’s name

NettieMelvin thrusts Julius into Mariche’s lap He points at
the boy’s nose gesticulating expressing bewilderment

AGATA
Nettie Please Be reasonable Make
an exception and tell us what is
happening There are only women in
this loft Nettie

August remains very still NettieMelvin is silent pondering
the request Julius turns his face into Mariche’s chest and
howls

MARICHE
(urgently)
What has happened to him

Julius points to his nose
Cherry Rev 66

AGATA
Nettie Be realistic What has
happened to Julius Please Just
speak this once

JULIUS
My nose There is a cherry pit in
my nose

Mariche presses on one of Julius’ nostrils

MARICHE
Blow Now Blow Julius

Julius blows the cherry pit out and Mariche runs her fingers
down his nose and the cherry pit comes out Ona inserts two
fingers into her mouth and whistles The Women stop talking
and look at her

ONA
If Julius has put a cherry pit up
his nose it means he has been
eating cherries or he has at
least been near cherries

The Women look at her silently a realization dawning

ONA (CONTD)
We have no cherries in the colony

MARICHE
(realizing)
Klaas sometimes brings them back
from the city

AGATA

Who gave you the cherries Julius
JULIUS

Papa
MARICHE

Papa is home now

JULIUS
No I saw him out on the road He’s
collecting animals

Mariche looks pale She looks up at MelvinNettie who nods

Agata steadies her gaze and is still Salome rushes to the
window cursing
Cherry Rev 66A

MARICHE
(to Julius)
If you see him again you can tell
him that we are all quilting

JULIUS
Isn’t that lying
MARICHE
No It’s something else Go now

Go with Nettie
Salmon Rev 67

Julius nods Melvin takes Julius’ hand and takes him down the
ladder

GRETA
Have we made a decision Are we
leaving

She looks at each woman and they each silently in their
own way agree Mariche is still

AUTJE
Yes

GRETA
We are leaving because-

AUTJE
We know why we are leaving We are
leaving because we cannot stay

Everyone looks at Autje taking this in Mariche beckons to
Autje Autje sits beside her and Mariche puts her arm around
her

NEITJE
What happens when we become hungry
Or afraid

ONA
We are not animals Hunger and fear
cannot be our guide

MEJAL
Should we not have more perspective
than animals

AGATA
Animals have perspective Remember
The dragonflies They set out
knowing that they will not see the
end of their journey but their
children will

MEJAL
Please for the love of Joshua
Judges Ruth can we start talking
practically

Agata smiles and twists her body from side to side in
delight

AGATA
I like that “For the love of
Joshua Judges Ruth”

down She sneaks up behind him then grabs his waist and

they leave with us

Tan Rev 69

AGATA
Surely we can’t be afraid of boys

Ona looks at August

ONA
August You’re the boys teacher
What is your feeling about this Do
boys of this age pose a threat to
our girls and women

August stops transcribing He puts his pen down and thinks

AUGUST
Yes Possibly Every one of us
male or female poses a potential
threat Thirteen and fourteen-year-
old boys are capable of causing
great damage to girls and women
and to each other

CUT TO

EXT SCHOOLHOUSE - MORNING 62

As we hear August’s voice we see the boys of the schoolhouse
racing They scrum around the victor and shove each other -
at first playfully and then more aggressively

AUGUST (VO)
It is a brash age They are
possessed of reckless urges
physical exuberance intense
curiosity that often results in
injury unbridled emotion
including deep tenderness and
empathy and not quite enough
experience or brain development to
fully understand or appreciate the
consequences of their actions or
words They are similar to the
yearlings young awkward gleeful
powerful They are tall muscular
sexually inquisitive creatures with
little impulse control but they
are children They are children and
they can be taught

INT SALOME’S KITCHEN - MORNING 63

We are close on Aaron He looks into the camera staring
silently inscrutable Two smaller children play in the
background

AUGUST (VO)
I believe that with direction firm
love and patience these boys are
capable of relearning their roles
as males in the colony I believe
in what the great poet Samuel
Taylor Coleridge thought were the
cardinal rules of early education
“To work by love and so generate
love To habituate the mind to
intellectual accuracy and truth To
excite imaginative power” He said
“Little is taught by contest or
dispute everything by sympathy and
love”

We now see Salome sitting across the table from Aaron
looking at him tenderly She puts her hand on his cheek He
moves away embarrassed He smiles at her awkwardly then
gets up and leaves her there the table shining clean in
front of her

Neitje has drawn pictures of the boys next to August’s
writing In some of the illustrations they do work in some
they are violent in some they study at school

AUGUST
I believe those boys should be
allowed to leave with the women
providing the women choose to
leave

MARICHE
It was a yes or no questionYou
shit like any other man why don’t
you talk like one
Cherry Rev 71

Mejal laughs Mariche catches herself shakes her head and
smiles

MARICHE (CONTD)
Sorry

SALOME
I won’t leave Aaron

AGATA
I would like to make a proposal We
must protect all of our children
Not only our daughters All boys
under the age of fifteen and the
ones that require special care must
accompany the women

SALOME
How do you mean must

ONA
What if they refuse If they don’t
want to leave

MARICHE
We can’t carry teenagers on our
backs

AGATA

We will try to influence our sons
But we cannot force them and they
may refuse it is true

NEITJE
But that would be very sad

AGATA
Let’s talk about our sadness after
we have nailed down our plan
August you would stay here to
teach the boys who remain

August nods Ona looks at August They share a long moment in
silence Agata watches them watching each other

NEITJE
What’s the point in trying to teach
them Fifteen-year-old boys still
believe that throwing horse turds
at the girls while we do the
milking shows their love

Autje laughs
Cherry Rev 72

AUTJE
But a boy who truly loves you will
intentionally miss when he throws
the shit or not throw it with
quite as much force

Mejal and Salome shake their heads

SALOME
My most hopeful dream for my four
year old girl is that one happy day
a boy will intentionally miss
hitting her with a clump of shit

MEJAL
Yes The day every mother dreams
of the hope that gets us through
the darkest hours

Autje glances out the east door She suddenly gets up and
goes to it

AUTJE
He’s here

Mariche looks as though she will be sick

MARICHE
Klaas

The other women rush to the east door They see in the
distance Klaas leading two horses walking away from them

GRETA
He has Ruth and Cheryl

They move to hide themselves away from the windows until he
is out of sight

sleeps on the floor Neitje and Autje kneel down beside them
waking each of them up gently talking to them They are
bleary eyed and don’t seem interested in what she has to say

MEJAL (0S)
I am worried about the women who
have voted to do nothing If Klaas
or any other man has returned
there is a high risk that these
women will inform them that we are
plotting

stares at her shaking her head almost imperceptibly There
is an endless silence

subdued in her movements watching each one of them closely
She looks across the field and sees Klaas beckoning to her
from the doorway of their house Her shoulders slump Greta
approaches her

GRETA
Don’t go Stay with me tonight Or
I will go with you

MARICHE
If I don’t go home it will draw
attention to all of us I must

about to change

She gives Greta a small smile Mariche heads towards the
house

She rolls up the map August points to a constellation of
bright stars

AUGUST (CONTD)
Do you know of the Southern Cross

Ona nods

AUGUST (CONTD)
You and the women can use the
Southern Cross for navigation If
you clench your right fist like
this-

He takes her hand and shapes it into a fist He holds it up
against the stars Her arm is rigid fist clenched like a
freedom fighter

AUGUST (CONTD)
Now align your first knuckle with
the axis of the Cross
He holds her hand her wrist

Agata puts her feet into Ona’s lap and Ona rubs them Ona
quietly sings “On the Old Rugged Cross” Agata sings every
word or two although she seems to be fighting for breath
August watches Ona and she watches him watching her Salome
is braiding Neitje’s hair and tugging tightly

NEITJE

in a sling fashioned from a feed bag Autje has a bruise on
her cheek in the shape of four fingers and a thumb Greta
rushes to Mariche takes her in her arms The rest of the

the house late and then he went to
the barn and found we had taken the
horses

SALOME
Did you tell him what we were
planning

Mariche nods Salome puts her head in her hands

AUTJE
She did But it was because he
wouldn’t stop hitting me and she
was trying to distract him

MARICHE
Yes But I also told him because I
suddenly felt very

The women take this in

MARICHE (CONTD)
I don’t think he believed me And
if he did I don’t think he’1l
remember He’1ll be passed out in
the barn all morning I’m sure

She turns to Autje and Neitje

AGATA
So Yesterday was a day for
talking Today is a day for action
When Klaas wakes up he may go to
the city to alert the other men We
have decided to leave before that
happens Is that accurate

The Women nod

AGATA (CONTD)
We have ruled out the option of
staying because-

MARICHE
I thought today was a day of
action not talk

The other women laugh watch Mariche closely and are silent
giving her space with her ravaged face this morning We can
hear animals lowing in the distance There is a hint of
light in the sky

We have decided that we want
that we are entitled to three
things

Mariche looks on the wall at August’s notes and Neitje’s
drawings She stares at a drawing Neitje has made of
children playing

MARICHE
We want our children to be safe

Mariche has begun to cry softly and is finding it difficult
to speak She looks up at a drawing on the wall of a woman
kneeling in prayer

MARICHE (CONTD)
We want to be steadfast in our
faith

She looks up at a drawing of a woman looking off a book in
her lap

MARICHE (CONTD)
We want to think

GRETA
Yes

Mariche looks down trying to stop the tears so that she can
continue speaking

Agata claps her hands and holds them together in midair

down the ladder in a chain August watches them especially
Ona He moves quickly towards the ladder to catch a glimpse
of her as she goes Ona looks back at them

AUGUST
Where is Aaron

SALOME
He is in the buggy waiting

AUGUST
You convinced him to leave

Salome doesn’t respond hands him the spray can August
stares at it

SALOME
Here You may need this For
protection

August’s eyes widen as he stares at the spray can and begins
to understand

AUGUST
Did you have to-

SALOME
Yes It’s just as though I had
picked up a sleeping child in the
night and carried him away from a
house that was on fire

AUGUST
Is it

SALOME
He’s coming with me He’s my child

August nods looking unsure

I broke the rules I did I broke
the new rules already Maybe I’ve
broken everything And we havent
yet begun I sprayed Scarface Janz
also She was planning to go to the
city to tell the men

Does she know how to get there

SALOME
No of course not

So it was an idle threat

SALOME
But I was afraid

Klaas too But he wasn’t awake yet
so he won’t remember being knocked
out Just like we didn’t

Salome goes to leave

SALOME (CONTD)
Goodbye August and good luck

AUGUST
Please take care of Ona and her

He comes back to the ladder and hands it to Salome

Why do you have a gun August
AUGUST

Because

AUGUST
But you’re not fleeing

That’s right We’ve chosen to
leave

AUGUST

But not Aaron
Salome is quiet for a moment She looks at him

SALOME
I will have to live with that

AUGUST
Don’t come back Don’t ever come
back any of you

Salome laughs She nods
SALOME

some of the sheets of paper from the walls

He hands her what he has gathered so far

AUGUST
Please give these to Ona

SALOME
But she can’t read them

Double Blue Rev 101

She pushes his hand with the papers in it back at him August
looks at her beginning to understand

Salome descends the ladder leaving August with the
notebooks

August goes to the north doors and opens them We see him
stand there in a WIDE FRAME WE MOVE QUICKLY TOWARDS HIM and
we see what he sees He watches Salome running away one
last time from the barn He can catch a glimpse of the
convoy of buggies lining up beside the wash house

EXT WASH HOUSE ROAD - MORNING 99

We run with children through the field obliviously carefree
in a wild game They approach the road and are ushered
towards buggies by the women WE MOVE QUICKLY ALONGSIDE THE
CONVOY AS MANY BAGS AND SUPPLIES ARE LOADED children are
passed up Women get inside A flurry of activity as last
minute barrels and cases are loaded in Among them we see
Mariche and her children Ona Agata Salome Mejal and
Greta Anna frantic runs alongside the convoy holding
tight to Helena’s hand as they run bags in her handlooking
scared Autje grabs Helena’s hand and helps her into a buggy
with Neitje Anna sighs with relief and follows her in

There is a commotion at the front of the convoy One of the
buggies behind Autje’s gets stuck with the wheel of the buggy
in front Neitje Autje and a GROUP OF WOMEN spontaneously
leap out and help to move the buggy into the correct
position The buggies begin to move
