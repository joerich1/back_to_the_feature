FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT
IN A SMALL TOWN TO THE NORTH OF BOGOTA COLOMBIA

EXT HILLSIDE BEHIND A SMALL BUILDING — DAY

The landscape is a poor neighborhood of narrow unpaved roads
etched into the side of a hill overlooking a small Colombian
town The buildings are all low - one and two-story — made
of poured concrete and cinder-block with lines of laundry
stretching from one to the other

In back of a building MARIA 17 with black wavy hair and
dark eyes is making out with JUAN 19 and skinny as a rail
Their lips are absolutely locked

Juan puts one hand behind her waist and presses her up
against the wall As he moves from kissing her lips to her
cheek Maria opens her eyes - looking rather unenthusiastic
Juan buries his face in her neck but Maria is staring up at
the pattern of a TV aerial at the top of the building

(NOTE ALL DIALOGUE IS IN SPANISH)

JUAN
Lets go to your house

MARIA
I don’t want to go to my house

JUAN
Where do you want to go then

MARIA
I dont know Someplace else

Maria gazes up at the top of the building and smiles

MARIA (CONTD)
How about up there

JUAN
(looks up)
On the roof Why do you wanna go up
there
MARIA
Why not Come on It’s not that
high
JUAN

What are you crazy

( )

MARIA
(fixes him)
See how you treat me You’re a drag

JUAN
Let’s not get started with this OK

MARIA
If I go up there will you follow me

JUAN
(reticent)
If I go are we gonna do it up there

Maria smiles She turns and takes a good look at the back of
the building She puts her foot on a rock and pulls herself
up to a first-floor window-sill She finds a small ledge and
continues to scale up

Juan looks sure she won’t make it up Maria concentrates on
what shes doing - never looking down

She pulls herself up to a second-floor window but then gets
stuck about six feet below the roof

JUAN (CONTD)
Come down We’1ll go to your place

Maria places her foot on a very small protrusion and pushes
up - she SLIPS but grabs the edge of the roof just in time
and pulls herself up Juan stares up in disbelief
MARIA
(smiles looking down)
Come on Your turn

JUAN
No way

MARIA
Come up - I have something to tell you

JUAN
Come down

MARIA
No

Beat Juan looks around at a loss for what to do
JUAN
You know what then I’m taking off

( )

MARIA
(exasperated)
Then go Im not coming down

JUAN
Fine You can come down the same way you
went up - alone I’11 see ya

Juan starts to walk away down the hill

Maria watches him go down toward a small isolated town
ringed by mountains

CUT TO

INT BEDROOM — BEFORE DAWN

In a small bedroom with lime-green walls and two single beds
Maria lies ASLEEP with her walkman next to her pillow On
the wall above her are torn-out magazine pictures of various
teen idols salsa stars and a pink cartoon teddy-bear
Maria’s mother JUANA calls from the other room

JUANA (OS)
Maria Get up

INT BATHROOM — BEFORE DAWN

A precarious electric water-heating element mounted on the
shower-head with wires sticking out of it shifts into the
On position Maria puts her head fully under the water
INT KITCHEN MAIN ROOM — BEFORE DAWN

PACHO one year old is CRYING on his back on a tattered
couch in the main room of the small house Maria’s sister
DIANA 19 stands over him pressing down on his stomach
ROSITA Maria’s grandmother moves to and from the cramped
kitchen setting out cups of hot chocolate and rolls JUANA
40 is already dressed and folding laundry

DIANA
His stomach is hard I’m really worried

Maria comes in combing her hair

MARIA
What are you doing

( )

DIANA
He hasn’t shit in like two days He’s
really constipated

MARIA
Whatever He’ll go when he goes Don’t
worry about it

JUANA
Maria don’t brush your hair in the
dining room please

MARIA
He’s cranky because he’s got someone
kneading his stomach like a ball of
dough
(tickling Pacho)
Isn’t that right Huh Isn’t that
right

Maria picks Pacho up and holds him over her head She throws
him and catches him

DIANA
(taking him back)
You’re scaring him

JUANA
Give him to me

ROSITA
(setting down hot chocolate)
Maria sit

Juana takes the baby and gives Diana a blanket

JUANA
Mama will you fix a tea for him
MARIA
Those teas aren’t gonna do anything for
him
ROSITA

Take him to the doctor this afternoon

DIANA
No Grandma I don’t trust that guy

MARIA

(gets up)
He doesn’t need to go to the doctor The
kid is fine

( )

Maria goes into the kitchen and opens the fridge

ROSITA
What are you looking for

MARIA
I don’t know I don’t feel like bread
I want something else

Maria cuts a piece of pork sausage for herself

ROSITA
That’s your breakfast

EXT ROAD — DARK MORNING

Maria Juana and Diana walk along a dark dusty road before
dawn The only light comes from the windows of other houses
they pass

They turn onto a PAVED STREET and stop at an arbitrary spot
on the sidewalk and wait with several other people There’s
a minimum of ambient morning light it’s cold people huddle

A creaky old SCHOOL BUS lumbers up and everyone files on -
except for Maria Juana kisses Maria’s cheek and gets on

JUANA
See you later honey

The bus pulls away and Maria continues to wait

INT MOVING BUS (ANOTHER) — VERY EARLY MORNING

Maria sits by the window with BLANCA also 17 but heavier-set
than Maria The bus lurches along The seats are full of
other people (mostly women) but there is no conversation -
only the sound of the driver’s tinny radio

Blanca has her head on Maria’s shoulder Maria stares out at
the passing farmland and cows

EXT PLANTATION GATEHOUSE — LATER

Maria and Blanca get off the bus and merge into a small sea
of people who funnel through a tall steel gate past a
uniformed guard with steel-toed boots and a shotgun On the
other side the grounds are landscaped and spotless
INT CHANGING ROOMS — CONTINUOUS

Maria Blanca and about two dozen other women put on blue
jumpsuits over their clothes along with thick rubber boots

INT EATING ROOM — CONTINUOUS

In a large room with long wooden tables and benches about a
hundred workers eat breakfast There is a din of
conversation At one table Blanca eats a roll as Maria
interrogates her

MARIA
So did you meet him

BLANCA
I waited by the plaza but he never came

MARIA
Are you kidding He didnt show up

BLANCA
Well it wasnt a real date He said he
might be there

MARIA
(laughing)
How long did you wait

BLANCA
Dont laugh

MARIA
Im not laughing How long did you wait

BLANCA
It doesnt matter He wasn’t really my
type Anyway You see that guy over
there

They both turn and look at a GUY in a green jumpsuit sitting
two tables away He makes eye contact with Blanca and SMILES

BLANCA (CONTD)
He smiles at me like all the time

The two of them GIGGLE uncontrollably
INT BATHROOM — LATER

Maria stands at the basin of the plantation bathroom She
splashes water on her face and rinses her mouth

INT FLOWER PLANTATION — LATER

In a vast greenhouse rows and rows of tall pink-rose plants
extend into the distance A space-man wearing a thick rubber
suit a rubber face mask and a rubber head-covering walks
through spraying a fine mist of chemical fumigants onto the
flowers Elsewhere in the same greenhouse women clip roses

This is a high-volume flower plantation MARIA works in the
warehouse — an immense hangar with a high roof and about
eighty workers all in blue jumpsuits There are flowers
everywhere - bundles of reds yellows oranges and violets

The whole place is a hive of activity some workers guide
large carts on a rail-system into the warehouse some measure
and classify the roses into bundles some place the bundles
in large boxes for shipment abroad It is a tightly
regimented operation

Maria wears thick rubber gloves and stands in front of a
splintering plywood board Next to her is a huge bunch of
100 red roses One by one she takes the roses examines the
quality of the buds measures the length and then with a
quick violent jerk she pulls them over an open blade to
strip off the thorns Its a tedious repetitive action

She is one in a line of twenty people doing the same work

She catches a thorn in her thumb and stops to examine it
through the hole in the tip of her glove Her skin is dotted
with thorn scars She’s sweating profusely and she wipes her
forehead with her sleeve

A SUPERVISOR walks from station to station tallying each
worker’s output on a clipboard

In another aisle about twenty feet away Blanca has the job
of bundling roses She sets down corrugated paper and then
one by one carefully arranges and wraps the flowers staples
the bundle shut and labels it - then starts all over again

Maria stares at the supervisor who is now several stations
up She has paused in her work again and is watching
everything else in the room with a removed critical stare
She continues to perspire and looks physically ill She
raises her hand trying to get her supervisor’s attention

( )

As the supervisor happens to look up he sees Marias hand in
the air sighs and makes his way back to her

SUPERVISOR
What is it

MARIA
Can I go to the bathroom

SUPERVISOR
Again

MARIA

I dont feel well

SUPERVISOR
Youve already been twice this morning
Youre under by four bins this hour
three last hour How are you going to
catch up if you keep going to the
bathroom

He stares at her expectantly

MARIA
Please Ill be quick

SUPERVISOR
Do you know what its like for me always
having to look over your shoulder Maria
You think its fun for me I have eighty-
four workers in this section and everyone
else puts their head down and does their
job But with you its like this
constant game of tug-of-war just to get
you to make quota At this point I

All of the sudden Maria VOMITS directly on the flowers
splattering her supervisor slightly

SUPERVISOR (CONTD)
What the hell is wrong with you This
is disgusting Look at this What the
hell

Maria doesn’t dare look up at him
SUPERVISOR (CONTD)
Look at these flowers What are you
gonna do about these Huh What are you

gonna do

She just stares at the flowers blankly

( )

SUPERVISOR (CONTD)
(exasperated)
Pick those up

Maria scoops up the bundle of flowers in her arms - vomit and
all With Blanca and the rest watching the supervisor leads
her over to a large BASIN

SUPERVISOR (CONTD)
Set them there

Maria sets the flowers on a cart He picks up a HOSE with a
spray nozzle and twists it until it shoots a fine mist

SUPERVISOR (contd)
(passing her the hose)
Wash them off

Maria picks up a rose and sprays it off

SUPERVISOR (CONTD)
Be careful with the bud

MARIA
But they’re already ruined

SUPERVISOR
I don’t care Wash them

MARIA
I need to go to the bathroom

SUPERVISOR
(really pissed)
You want to go to the bathroom then you

can go on your lunch break Or you can
go right now and keep walking out the
door

(he stares her down)
I want all these flowers clean And when
you’re done you’re gonna go back to your
station and make up the bins you owe me
Understood

The supervisor marches off leaving Maria there - fuming

EXT TOWN STREETS — DAY

Maria sits on a park bench and picks at her lunch as a group
of kids her age dressed in school uniforms passes by She
makes eye contact with one but they move on past She checks
the time

EXT STREET — AFTERNOON
In town Maria walks up the street

JUANA (OS)
Maria

Maria sees her mother at a small store buying fruits and
vegetables She crosses over to her

Juana pays for the two bags of groceries and puts a few coins
of change in her pocket She picks up the bags and the two
of them walk on in silence

INT PHARMACY — CONTINUOUS

It’s a small place with the drugs on the wall behind the
counter Diana watches as a WOMAN removes foil-wrapped
TABLETS from a box and counts them out Juana enters
trailed by Maria

JUANA
Is everything OK

DIANA
It’s 9600 Do you have any money

JUANA
(to Maria)
Lend your sister the money

MARIA
Why do I have to pay for it
DIANA
It’s for Pacho He started vomiting
MARIA
So Where’s your money
JUANA
Maria
MARIA

I give up practically all of what I make
and Diana doesn’t put in any of hers
And now I’m supposed to pay for Pacho’s
medicine too

( )

JUANA
Maria don’t start Give your sister the
money

Juana glares at her daughter Maria finally digs into her
pocket and hands over the money

JUANA (contd)
You can keep the extra nine-thousand six-
hundred when you get paid at the end of
the month I don’t know why everything
always has to be so difficult with you

Maria watches Diana pay And then as if trying to get back
at them she says

MARIA
Well there’s not going to be a next
paycheck Because I quit
JUANA
What When
MARIA
Today
JUANA

What happened

MARIA
They wouldn’t let me go to the bathroom

JUANA
At all

MARIA
It’s not just that I don’t like the way
they treat me So I quit

JUANA
What are you going to do

The woman behind the counter looks very uncomfortable

DIANA
You’re really fucking stupid

MARIA
Why don’t you shut up

DIANA
Don’t tell me to shut up

( )

MARIA
You don’t know how they treated me

DIANA
You could have put up with it You’re an
idiot

MARIA
(overlapping)
Why do I have to put up with it Why am
I always the one to put up with it all

DIANA
(overlapping)
-Why don’t you think of the family for
once

JUANA
Enough Quiet both of you
(beat)

your job back

MARIA

DIANA

MARIA

At least it’s a decent job

MARIA
Oh please what’s decent about it

JUANA
Maria You have to go back

MARIA
Didn’t you hear me I’m not going
back I’m not

With that Maria storms out of the pharmacy and leaves them
standing there

EXT PLAZA — EARLY EVENING

Maria sits by the plaza fountain with Juan and Blanca and a
group of about five other girls and guys crowded around
Juan’s got a BOTTLE of aguardiente and everyone is laughing
except Maria who hasn’t shaken her bad mood

BLANCA
(laughing)
You should have seen the look on the
supervisor’s face He was completely

covered in it

JUAN
This deserves a toast

Juan pours a shot for Maria in a little plastic cup

JUAN (CONTD)
To Maria Because she kicks ass

She sips it winces and then swallows the rest in one gulp

SMASH CUT TO

EXT OUTDOOR FIESTA — NIGHT

A small rocket whizzes into the air and EXPLODES On a side-
street off the plaza there’s a small fiesta going on - with
a little band of a dozen local guys (in uniform) playing a
slightly sloppy but very energetic salsa - and a crowd of
about forty people of all ages - some dancing some watching

Maria and Blanca dance up a storm together - Maria dancing
lead She’s a very good dancer very lively and quite sexy
Most of all she just has a good time - giggling and laughing
with Blanca Juan and the guys are sitting on the curb
working their way steadily through the bottle of aguardiente

The music stops and all the dancers fan themselves off - Juan
walks among the band members pouring each a shot of liquor

MARIA
(to Blanca)
Hey there’s your boyfriend

Blanca follows Maria’s gaze and sees the SMILING GUY from

work talking with a FRIEND Sure enough he makes eye
contact with Blanca and smiles

( )

BLANCA
(giggling and turning away)
Oh my god

MARIA
You have to dance with him

BLANCA
No way

Hearing that Maria grabs Blanca’s wrist and leads her right
over to the Smiling Guy and his Friend

MARIA

Hi
SMILING GUY

Hi
MARIA

I’m Maria This is Blanca
BLANCA

(beet red)

Oh my god

SMILING GUY

FRANKLIN
Hi

Unlike Felipe Franklin is dressed stylishly with a hip
shirt designer jeans and a gold chain Next to him Felipe
looks downright meek

MARIA
Blanca wants you to ask her to dance

FRANKLIN
Go for it

FELIPE
(smiling)
Do you want to dance

BLANCA
OK

Felipe leads Blanca out into the dance area as the band

strikes up Maria watches them dance and then walks over to
Juan

( )

MARIA
Juan I want to dance

Juan is clearly too drunk to dance and more interested in his
guy friends He takes her in his arms and mock dances
drunkenly in a circle laughing She breaks away annoyed

MARIA (cont’d)
What’s wrong with you

JUAN
(drunk )
What why
She walks away and stands watching Blanca and Felipe
FRANKLIN
(out of nowhere)
Wanna dance

Maria considers it glances toward Juan

FRANKLIN (cont’d)
What do you say

MARIA
-Sure

Franklin leads her out and the two of them dance The more
she dances the more into it Maria gets - looking over at
Juan occasionally - as if she were dancing to spite him
EXT TOWN — DAY

Maria walks the dirt road down the hill and into town

She walks by several store fronts looking occasionally
inside Her gait is slow and not particularly determined
INT MUSIC SHOP — DAY

Maria steps into a small music shop - basically just a glass
case with various CD’s and racks full of cassettes on either
wall A MAN catalogues boxes of music as Latin rap plays on
a small stereo He nods at Maria - they seem to recognize

each other She takes a tape off the wall and examines it

MARIA
How much is it

( )

MAN
(turns the music down)
Fifteen thousand two hundred

Maria puts it back on the wall She watches the man work

MARIA
You have a lot of work

MAN
I have to catalogue everything keep
track of what I sold what I didn’t

Maria contemplates asking him for a job but the store is
obviously a one-man operation

women talk quietly in the pews She kneels down crosses

request

with mopeds and motorcycles JUAN is squatting next to a
mechanic watching him work

cross the street to

Juan each take an arepa and a Coca-cola Juan pays and takes
the change

( )

They walk over to the park and sit on the grass and eat

They don’t have any conversation at all while they eat - they
just chew in silence At a certain point Maria stops and
watches Juan take another bite - he’s absorbed in chewing

MARIA
I have something to tell you

EXT BOGOTA STREETS BAR - DAY

Bogota is loud and chaotic - buses clog the streets horns

With Maria’s arms around his waist Franklin weaves in and out
of city traffic and pulls up in front of a bar ona
sidestreet in an uncertain neighborhood

INT BAR — DAY
Its a dimly-lit place with a pool table at the back and
tables along the wall opposite the bar It’s filled almost

entirely with MEN all older Maria looks rather
uncomfortable as she follows Franklin in

( )

FRANKLIN
You want something to drink
(to the bartender )
Give me a beer and a soda for her
(to Maria)

a minute

He leaves Maria at the bar and heads to the back table where
a MAN sits with the only other WOMAN in the place Franklin
shakes the mans hand and points to Maria Maria sips her
soda

Franklin comes back over and waits with Maria A moment
later the woman at the far table gets up She makes very
definite eye contact with Maria as she walks out

FRANKLIN (CONTD)
Come on

Franklin introduces Maria to JAVIER a well-groomed man of
about 60 with a gold chain an ironed shirt and a cane
leaning up against the table He effects an incredibly
paternal tone calming but also intimidating

JAVIER
Sit down

Maria sits opposite him Franklin pulls up a third chair

JAVIER (cont’d)
So you’re a friend of Franklin’s And

-No no no No strings attached

Maria stares at the money on the table

EXT STREET BUS STOP — LATER

Maria walks across the busy street and stops at the bus stop
Among the people waiting for the bus Maria recognizes the
WOMAN who was sitting at Javiers table in the bar A moment
later the BUS rolls up and they all get on

INT BUS — CONTINUOUS

Maria sees a free seat next to the WOMAN She sits The
woman recognizes Maria but neither of them says anything

( )

MARIA
You were in the bar right
(no response)
My name is Maria

The woman glances at Maria then looks away

WOMAN
I’m Lucy

LUCY looks to be about 24 Shes dressed nicely — not fancy
just more stylish than Maria But from the way she carries
herself and talks shes clearly from the same class as Maria

MARIA
Do you work for Javier Is it hard

LUCY
(not making eye contact)
Its not easy but its not too difficult
either How old are you

MARIA
Seventeen I said eighteen though

LUCY
(looks at Maria)
You just have to be prepared and know how
to do it right

Maria takes this in

INT MARIA’S HOUSE — DAY

Maria comes home Diana is folding clothes at the table
Maria walks right past her toward the kitchen

DIANA
Where have you been

MARIA
I went to the city to ask Jessica to find
me work

DIANA
(following Maria)
And

MARIA
And nothing It’s none of your business

( )

DIANA
Don’t tell me it’s none of my business

MARIA
It isn’t

DIANA
You didn’t find anything You’d tell me
if you found something You have to go
back to the plantation and ask for your
job back

MARIA

No I don’t

DIANA
It’s not fair to mom You know how hard
it is for her and now you’re making
things even worse

MARIA
Get off my back

DIANA
(getting emotional)
Don’t tell me to get off your fucking
back Pacho got a hundred and six fever
today

MARIA
He’s your kid

DIANA
I know he’s my kid So

MARIA
So he’s your responsibility

DIANA
(yelling)
We’re all equal in this house We all
have to pull our weight You have to get
a job

MARIA
Well I already got one

DIANA
What job Cut the shit

Maria stares at Diana She then reaches into her pocket and

pulls out the money Javier gave her Diana’s eyes widen
Maria peels off a few bills and throws them down

( )

MARIA
At least I put in my share

Maria storms out of the kitchen and into her room where she
flops onto her bed fuming She SLAMS the door

EXT STREET A NEARBY TOWN — DAY

Maria walks up the street in another town slightly bigger
than her own She knocks on the door of a concrete house
slightly nicer than her own The door opens and it’s LUCY

LUCY
Hi

INT LUCY’S HOUSE — DAY

Lucy’s house is nice - spacious though vacant-feeling with a
large table and chairs and a relatively new hi-fi Maria
sits alone Lucy comes in from the kitchen with a small bag —
full of GRAPES She sits

LUCY
Here
(hands Maria a grape)
Hold it in your mouth

Maria puts it in her mouth and holds it there
LUCY (cont’‘d)
Just hold it Let it slide to the back
All the way Now open your throat

Maria gags — then bites into the grape and swallows it

LUCY (CONTD)
You have to practice with the grapes

Lucy passes her the bag of grapes Maria picks one out

MARIA
You can swallow that

Lucy puts a grape in her mouth and swallows it whole Maria
stares in horrified awe

LUCY
You cant eat anything for the last
twenty-four hours Your stomach has to
be totally empty Theyll lie about how
many you have to swallow

( )

MARIA
How many will it be

LUCY
For someone your size maybe sixty or
seventy pellets

MARIA
Oh my god

LUCY
Be glad youre little Big guys swallow
like ninety or a hundred Make sure

theyre well wrapped If even one of
them opens up inside you youll die Not
as fast as cocaine Cocaine will make
your heart explode immediately Heroin
takes longer but you still die unless
you get the right medicine

Maria’s eyes widen

LUCY (CONTD)
Wear nice clothes Nothing flashy just
something nice - so you don’t look like a
peasant They may ask you questions in
the airport Javier will tell you what

to say
MARIA

How many times have you done this
LUCY

- Two

MARIA

And it went OK
LUCY

---Im still here

(beat)
The first time I did it I thought I
wanted to go see my sister She lives in
New York I haven’t seen her in four
years But then I got there and I
realized What am I going to tell her
How am I going to explain how I got here
I love her but were really different
you know She would kill me if she knew
I was doing this The second time I did
it I went and saw where she lives but I
couldn’t knock on the door

( )

MARIA
What is America like

LUCY
--Straight Everything’s in perfect

squares

INT BATHROOM — MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

Maria stands in front of the mirror and places a grape in her
mouth She tries to swallow it and GAGS She tries again
She looks very nervous - almost on the verge of tears

EXT YARD — DAY

In the yard behind her house Maria is washing laundry by
hand Blanca sits watching her

BLANCA
So how’s that thing

MARIA
What thing

BLANCA
Your job What do you have to do

MARIA

(fixes her)
I told you not to talk about it

Maria goes to hang a sheet Blanca watches her a beat and
then opens her purse and pulls something out

BLANCA
Maria Maria look at me

Blanca puts a GRAPE in her mouth

Maria finally looks over
She

Maria stares at her in shock as she tries to swallow it
gags and spits it out

MARIA
What the hell are you doing

BLANCA
I’m going to be a mule I talked to

Franklin and he arranged it

MARIA
(looks at Blanca)
You what

( )

BLANCA
You heard me Why not

MARIA
Because you can’t you won’t make it

BLANCA
Well I’m doing it I already told them

MARIA
Blanca what the hell

BLANCA
It’s five thousand dollars Maria Do

figured it out It’s like ten million
I can buy my family a house with that

MARIA
You can’t go

BLANCA
You know what I don’t need your
permission I can do what I want

MARIA
Do you realize what youre saying
Blanca you have to tell them you’re not

BLANCA
No Anyway I can’t now I already

Blanca looks trapped Maria turns away annoyed

MARIA
--Do you know what you’re going to tell
your family

BLANCA
Do you

INT BEDROOM — EVENING

JUANA
I don’t understand You’re going all the
way to Chiquinquira To work as a
secretary

CUT TO

( )

Juana stands in the doorway of Maria and Diana’s bedroom
watching as Maria folds clothes and puts them into a small
suitcase Diana sits on her own bed

MARIA
I already told you

JUANA
Well tell me again

MARIA
I got it through Blanca’s aunt

JUANA
But you don’t know anything about working
in an office

MARIA
(crossing away from her mother)
What you don’t think I’m smart enough

JUANA
I didn’t say that

Juana sits at the foot of Maria’s bed She glances to Diana
clearly distraught - then watches Maria continue to go
through her clothes

JUANA (contd)
I just don’t understand why you have to
go so far away Maria

Maria finally looks at her mother They share a beat They
both clearly feel uncomfortable but Maria buries her
uncertainty with a distant resolve

EXT PLAZA — MID-MORNING

Her hair pulled back and her face made up Maria is dressed
in a nice blouse and skirt — clearly her nicest outfit - as
she walks down into town carrying her suitcase

She sits on a bench on the edge of the town square She
looks to the center of the plaza and sees JUAN with his
bicycle standing amongst friends He turns and they make eye
contact After a moment of hesitation he rides over

MARIA

(stands awkward)
Hi

( )

JUAN
Hi
MARIA
How are you doing
JUAN
Fine You
MARIA
OK
Pause
JUAN

I need my tapes my back

MARIA
-Sure

She opens her walkman ejects the tape and hands it him
Then she goes into her bag and pulls out a handful of tapes
She gives him all but one which she puts back in her bag
MARIA (cont’d)
(beat)
Do you want the walkman back

JUAN
That was a present

They stare at each other

JUAN (CONTD)
You look nice

MARIA
Thanks

Just then FRANKLIN rides up on his motorcycle and stops

Maria looks enormously uncomfortable Juan and Franklin look
at each other but no-one makes any attempt at introductions

JUAN
(finally)
I gotta go

MARIA
Ill see you later

Juan gets on his bike and rides off with the tapes in one
hand Maria watches him go

( )

FRANKLIN
(breaking her moment)
You ready

He gets her suitcase and puts it on the back of his
motorcycle Maria gives a final look at Juan as she climbs
on

EXT MOVING MOTORCYCLE COUNTRYSIDE AND CITY — CONTINUOUS
Franklin and Maria ride with Maria’s suitcase strapped to the
back of the bike - along the road and then into the city He
weaves in and out of traffic and finally pulls over at
EXT INT PHARMACY — CONTINUOUS

-a perfectly ordinary pharmacy in the middle of the city
Franklin accompanies Maria inside and nods hello to the
PHARMACIST behind the counter The pharmacist disappears

into the back The two of them wait

MARIA
And Blanca

FRANKLIN
She’s in another place

The sliding door-display case suddenly rolls open - revealing
the pharmacist standing behind it expectantly Franklin
passes him Maria’s suitcase

FRANKLIN (CONTD)
(reading her nervousness)
Don’t worry Everything’s gonna be fine
He gives her a kiss on the cheek She hesitates before
turning away from him and follows the pharmacist into the
back
INT PHARMACY BACK ROOM — CONTINUOUS

The pharmacist leads Maria into a small stark room with a
table a few chairs a sink and a small bed in the corner

( )

At the other end of the table is a YOUNG MAN in his 20s
Hes got various paraphernalia spread out in front of him a
BOX OF SEVERAL DOZEN RUBBER SURGICAL GLOVES a pair of
SCISSORS a ROLL OF PLASTIC WRAP a DIGITAL SCALE a small
box of DENTAL FLOSS a BOTTLE OF SALAD OIL a SMALL BOWL and
two bags of HEROIN

He transfers a precise amount of heroin from the scale into
the severed finger of a latex glove which he then places
into a HAND-OPERATED PRESS pumping the lever and packing it
down into a dense one-inch capsule

The pharmacist steps out of the room as Maria sits and
watches the young man entranced

SERIES OF JUMP CUTS

He cuts the fingers off several of the rubber gloves He then
slides the heroin capsule into a rubber finger and packs it
all the way down into the bottom

He takes the finger full of heroin and stuffs it inside a
second rubber finger — then another and another until its
been buried in SIX LAYERS of rubber fingers

He breaks off a piece of DENTAL FLOSS and ties it shut like a
rubber balloon He then trims off the excess dental floss
and the excess rubber

He sets the pellet down — a snug little thumb-sized package
— and begins making another

The pharmacist re-enters the room breaking Maria’s trance
He hands her two small PILLS and a cup of water

PHARMACIST
This will stop your bowels

She puts the pills in her mouth and swallows them The
pharmacist then raises a bottle of RED LIQUID with a tube and
an atomizer attached

PHARMACIST (cont‘d)
Open you mouth

As he sprays the liquid into Maria’s throat JAVIER steps in
and sits down at the table with her The pharmacist finishes
and leaves the room

Javier pulls the SMALL BOWL over to him and pours it full of

SALAD OIL He takes one of the pellets and dips it in the
oil completely covering it

( )

He passes it to Maria and she puts it in her mouth She
tries to swallow it but GAGS

JAVIER
Relax

She puts the pellet back in her mouth and sets it deep in her
throat with her fingers

JAVIER (CONTD)
Dont put your fingers in so much

Maria starts to gag again

JAVIER (CONTD)
Did you practice with the grapes

MARIA
Yes

JAVIER
If you cant do this well stop now

MARIA
No really I can do it Just give me a
second

Maria looks nervous She puts the pellet in her mouth and
holds it there

JAVIER
Just let it slide down

She tilts her head back and the pellet goes down She looks
very relieved

MARIA
See

JAVIER
Good

He dips another pellet in oil and holds it out to her

AN HOUR LATER - Maria paces around the room The young man
packs up his stuff as Maria and Javier continue to work

JAVIER (CONTD)
How do you feel

MARIA
How many is it so far

( )

JAVIER
Twenty-three

Maria presses her stomach

JAVIER (CONTD)
Here Lay down on the bed

She lays down Javier places his hands on her stomach

MARIA
What are you doing

JAVIER
They have to settle properly

He massages her stomach manipulating the pellets inside
The door opens and the PHARMACIST brings in a bowl of SOUP

JAVIER (CONTD)
Have some soup

Maria gets up and sits at the table She takes a spoonful of
soup with great trepidation It hurts going down

PHARMACIST
Do you want more anesthetic

Maria shakes her head No Javier places another pellet in her
bowl She gets it on her spoon along with some soup and
stares at it

A FEW HOURS LATER - the room is illuminated by early
afternoon light Maria sits at the table with her head down
Javier is holding out a pellet

JAVIER
One more

MARIA
How many

JAVIER

Sixty-two Come on

She stares at him hatefully before taking the pellet She
swallows it slowly but without gagging

JAVIER (CONTD)
Good Ill be right back

He turns and leaves the room

( )
4l

Maria takes a beat alone She goes to her things and removes
from her purse a toothbrush and a small tube of toothpaste
She goes to the sink and brushes her teeth She rinses and
spits and then catches sight of herself in the mirror

Javier comes back in sits at the table and removes from his
wallet a wad of AMERICAN MONEY - 20-dollar bills She sits

JAVIER (CONTD)
(hands her the money)
This is eight hundred dollars

Maria stares at the money Never in her life has she held
this much

JAVIER (cont’d)
When they ask you how much youre coming
to America with tell them eight hundred
dollars Just say youve been saving up
(handing her papers)
This is your ticket Round trip - one
week This is your passport and visa

She stares at them - fascinated He writes something on a
piece of PAPER and passes it to her

MARIA
(reads mispronouncing)
Motor Lodge 46

JAVIER
That’s the name and address of the hotel
where you say you’re staying Do you
remember why you’re in America

MARIA
Im on vacation

JAVIER
(testing her)
And how long are you here for

MARIA
One week

JAVIER
Who bought this ticket

MARIA
A friend of mine

JAVIER
Where

( )

MARIA
At a travel agency on Plaza Bolivar

JAVIER
Where do you plan to stay in America

MARIA
I’m going to stay in a hotel

JAVIER
Which hotel

MARIA
(reading)
Motor Lodge 46

JAVIER
Good How are you feeling

MARIA
Like hungry but full - it’s weird

JAVIER
You can drink on the plane but don’t eat
or it’ll make your stomach release acid
Don’t talk to anyone on the plane Even
the stewardesses spy for the DEA Once
youve been passed through Customs youll
come out through an electric sliding
door On the other side of that therell
be someone there to meet you

MARIA
How will I know who it is

JAVIER
Theyll know you If theyre not there
for some reason call this number

He takes back the paper and writes a TELEPHONE NUMBER on it

JAVIER (CONTD)
The key is to stay calm and act like
nothing’s wrong But if you do get caught
just keep quiet

(he leans in)

If you give them any information well
leave you to rot in there while we go to
your house and have a chat with your
grandmother your mother your sister
and little Pachito Same thing if any of
whats in your stomach disappears along
the way

(MORE )

( )

JAVIER (CONTD)
We know exactly how much each one of
those 62 pellets you’ve got weighs Do I
make myself clear

He glares into her eyes The effect is chilling

INT AIRPORT X-RAY CHECK POINT — AFTERNOON

Maria puts her purse on the conveyor belt and steps through
the metal detector One guard scans her up and down with
HANDHELD METAL DETECTOR and another then pats her down As
Maria stares straight ahead she suddenly sees something odd
BLANCA - dressed vampy with cleavage and lipstick - browsing
perfume at the duty-free shop They make brief eye contact

CUT TO

INT AIRPLANE CABIN — LATER

Maria gazes out the window as the plane picks up speed She
crosses herself and mutters a Hail Mary She closes her eyes
as her back is pressed up against the seatback and the plane
becomes airborne For the first time in her life she is off
the surface of the planet flying She stares out and
watches with fascination as the world shrinks away below her

CUT TO
The fasten seat belt sign is turned off with a soft CHIME

The woman next to her (Carolina) undoes her seat belt and
gets up

Maria looks over at the people on the other side of the
aisle When she looks forward she is surprised to see LUCY
getting up and making her way to the aisle

Maria unbuckles her seatbelt and then approaches Lucy who is
getting a pillow and a blanket out of the overhead bin

MARIA
(hushed)
I didnt know you were going again

LUCY
I didnt either It just happened

MARIA
You know we’re not the only ones

( )

LUCY
Thats how it works They send a bunch
of us so if one gets stopped it makes it
easier for the rest to slip through

MARIA
Oh

A STEWARDESS suddenly passes behind them They are both
immediately silent Lucy moves back to her seat

CUT TO

Maria looks through the IN-FLIGHT MAGAZINE at all the
pictures a spread on Disneyland a photograph of a
businessman in a chic officeand then the MAP OF THE WORLD
with all of the airline’s flight paths indicated

The DINNER CART is maneuvered slowly down the aisle
Carolina pulls her airplane headphones out of one ear

CAROLINA
Its about time Im starved

The stewardess approaches

STEWARDESS
Chicken or beef

CAROLINA
Chicken

STEWARDESS
For you

MARIA

-Chicken please
The stewardess turns to get the trays

STEWARDESS
Here you are

And now Maria finds herself staring at a perfectly delicious
looking tray of steaming hot food The woman next to her
unwraps her fork and decides to strike up conversation

CAROLINA
Do you go to the United States a lot

MARIA
Well

( )

Maria cuts off a piece of chicken and puts it in her mouth
She chews but doesn’t swallow Her neighbor is more
interested in talking than in listening

CAROLINA
I go every year to visit my daughter
She married an American and they’ve got a
beautiful house on Long Island Of
course I think the children should be
the ones to come to Colombia to visit
their grandmother instead of the other
way around

The woman TALKS and TALKS - oblivious to whether Maria is in
fact eating or not

Maria carefully spits her food out into her napkin

CUT TO

LATER -

Maria is reaching up playing with the buttons and nozzles -
trying to figure out how to control the air The seats next
to her are empty

Suddenly BLANCA is standing in the aisle She looks over
her shoulder and quickly sits down in the empty seat next to
Maria

MARIA
What the hell are you doing

BLANCA
I saw you talking to that woman before
Who was she

MARIA
(hesitates)
Shes you know

BLANCA

You see that woman

Maria leans forward and spots a woman (CONSTANZA) sitting one
row back on the aisle

BLANCA (contd)
I met her before through Franklin
(beat)
So what were you two talking about

( )

MARIA
She said if one of us gets stopped at
Customs it creates a distraction for the
others to pass

BLANCA
So who’s going to go first

MARIA
I don’t know Whoever

BLANCA
I don’t want to go first I’11 wait and
see what happens to her

MARIA
I thought we were supposed to go right
through without waiting

Beat

BLANCA
--I feel like when I’ve got my period

MARIA
--I feel like I need to go the bathroom

CAROLINA (0S)
Excuse me

Carolina is standing in the aisle looking annoyed

BLANCA
(getting up)
Sorry

As Carolina settles back into her seat Maria places her
pillow under her ear and closes her eyes

CUT TO

LUCY - she sits in her seat dabbing her forehead with a
napkin The cabin lights are dimmed the in-flight movie
playing Maria wakes up Carolina has fallen asleep with
her headphones on

Maria lifts her shirt and presses her abdomen in discomfort
She unbuttons her pants trying to relieve the pressure

She climbs over Carolina and moves to the aisle CONSTANZA
looks up at her as she passes

INT AIRPLANE LAVATORY — CONTINUOUS

Maria locks the LAVATORY door and the lights come on She
pulls down her pants and sits on the toilet As she contorts
her face we hear the TINKLE of urine on metal

INT AIRPLANE CABIN — CONTINUOUS

LUCY is sweating profusely still dabbing herself with a
napkin She doesnt look well She gets up and maneuvers to
the aisle

INT LAVATORY — CONTINUOUS

Sitting on the toilet Maria suddenly has a look of PANIC in
her eyes Desperately she grabs paper towels from the
dispenser

IN THE PLANE CABIN — Lucy walks slowly down the aisle She
sees Blanca The two of them lock eyes but Lucy keeps
walking

IN THE LAVATORY — Maria holds her hand under cold water in
the sink Shes rinsing off TWO PELLETS

She opens her purse and removes her tube of TOOTHPASTE

PLANE CABIN — Lucy comes to the back of the plane and waits
by the lavatory looking sicker all the time

LAVATORY — Maria squeezes toothpaste onto the second pellet
smears it on and takes a beat She puts the pellet in her
mouth tilts her head back and swallows She then looks at
herself in the mirror and tries to compose herself

PLANE CABIN - Maria comes out of the lavatory face to face
with LUCY Lucy looks desperate — sweating nervous

LUCY
I dont feel well

MARIA
What are you going to do

Lucy has a blank nervous look on her face
MARIA (CONTD)
Calm down As soon as we arrive we’re

going to get you to a doctor You’re
going to be fine

( )

LUCY
(pulling it together)
I know I know
(beat)
Thanks

Maria heads back up the aisle - past Blanca - to her seat
casting a glance over her shoulder as she sits

CUT TO

The STEWARDESS works her way down the aisle with a stack of
YELLOW CUSTOMS CARDS She gives them to Maria and Carolina

Maria reads the card and gets to a blank space for an ADDRESS
where she plans to stay in the US She reaches into her
pocket for the paper with the name of the hotel but she can’t
find it She searches all her pockets and then in her purse
but the paper is nowhere

She looks over to copy her neighbor’s answer but Carolina
finishes writing and tucks the card away

Maria gets up and walks forward to the middle Emergency Exit
and turns to look at Lucy Lucy looking still worse
notices Maria and gets concerned She glances over her
shoulder gets up and makes her way over to Maria

LUCY (contd)
(hushed)
Ive been thinking about telling the
stewardess Im sick They could get me a
doctor

MARIA
But youll end up in jail once they find
out whats wrong with you

LUCY
But Ill be alive

MARIA
(hesitates)
Dont Just wait
Lucy looks thankful to Maria for supporting her
MARIA (CONTD)

--I lost the name the hotel Do you
have it

( )

LUCY
No I always give them my sister’s
address
(beat)

Do you have a pen

Maria gives her a pen - Lucy tears off a corner of her ticket
envelope

LUCY (CONTD)
(scribbling)
Its my sisters address in Queens New
York

CUT TO

NEW YORK SKYLINE AT NIGHT Blanca looks out her window Lucy
meanwhile touches up her make-up trying to hide how sick she
is Maria looks out her window playing nervously with the
crucifix on her necklace

INT AIRPORT CORRIDORS — NIGHT

Lucy comes off the plane amid Constanza and other passengers
Maria walks down the same corridor Blanca follows Maria

INT BAGGAGE CLAIM CUSTOMS AREA — CONTINUOUS

Maria stands by a large baggage carousel with other
passengers from the plane She spots Blanca and Constanza at
various points across from her Lucy stands about ten feet
away from her - looking sick but doing her best to keep her
nerves under control

There are about FIFTEEN CUSTOMS INSPECTORS across the room —
men and women — looking bored talking among themselves as
they wait for passengers to come through

Bags tumble down the chute - some huge some swathed in
plastic wrap They get clogged on the carousel Three
AIRPORT BAGGAGE HANDLERS unknot them Passengers struggle to
pull their luggage off and head through Customs Blanca takes
her bag off and lingers — as if waiting for a second bag

Lucy pulls a SMALL RED SUITCASE off She looks at Maria —
and then steps to the short line by the first two inspectors

Maria looks down but there’s no sign of her suitcase

Lucy — nervous and sick — hands her yellow card to the
inspector He gives her a quick look and waves her through

( )

Everyone breathes a sigh of relief

Lucy makes eye contact with Maria from the other side — and
then passes outside through a sliding electric door

Constanza steps up to an inspector The inspector asks her
something and then points to the secondary inspection point
She looks mortified as she takes her bag over to be checked

Blanca sees this takes her bag and proceeds directly to
Customs Maria looks desperate for her bag to come around

Blanca gets at the end of the line at Customs At last Maria
grabs her bag off the carousel She begins to move toward
the line but before she even gets there she is stopped by a
roaming INSPECTOR - a tall man with a buzz cut

INSPECTOR
(in English)
Hello May I see your passport ticket
and declaration card

Maria stares at him blankly

INSPECTOR (CONTD)
(repeating in Spanish)
May I see your passport ticket and
declaration card

Maria — containing her fear — hands over her documents The
inspector looks at them

INSPECTOR (contd)
Where are you coming from today

MARIA
Colombia
INSPECTOR
And where are you traveling to
MARIA
New York
INSPECTOR

Are these all your bags

MARIA
Yes

The inspector takes a beat

( )

INSPECTOR
Would you mind coming with me

Maria follows the inspector as they go directly to the
inspection counter opposite Constanza Maria looks over and
sees Blanca being waved right through

INSPECTOR (CONTD)
Place your suitcase on the counter
Open it please

Maria does so The inspector puts on a pair of RUBBER
GLOVES opens it up and begins to check its contents piling
up Maria’s clothes

Throughout the inspector invokes a strangely casual
friendly tone

INSPECTOR (CONTD)
What’s the purpose of your stay

MARIA
Vacation

INSPECTOR
How long will you be here

MARIA
One week

The inspector feels all the sides of the suitcase

A SECOND INSPECTOR - a Latina woman - walks up and watches as
the first agent continues his inspection

INSPECTOR
Only a week No more
MARIA
No
INSPECTOR

Where will you be staying

MARIA
-With my friend

INSPECTOR
Where does your friend live

The inspector finds a pair of shoes and checks the soles —
bending them looking closely at the heels

( )

Maria looks beyond him at the opposite counter and watches
CONSTANZA answer questions - the contents of her suitcase
piled up

INSPECTOR (CONTD)
(looking up repeating)
Where does your friend live

MARIA
New York

INSPECTOR
Is she coming to pick you up today

MARIA
-No

INSPECTOR
And how are you going to get there

MARIA
Uh In a taxi

INSPECTOR
And this is all your luggage

MARIA
Yes

He finishes going through her things and takes another look
at her paperwork

INSPECTOR
Thank you very much Sorry to bother
you Have a good stay in New York

Maria still nervous re-arranges the clothes in her suitcase
and is starting to shut it when the second agent speaks up

FEMALE INSPECTOR 2
(in English)
She looks nervous
(to Maria)
You look nervous

INSPECTOR
(translating)
She says you look nervous

MARIA
-No I’m not

( )

FEMALE INSPECTOR 2
(in Spanish)
Why do you look so nervous

MARIA
But I’m not

The second inspector stares at her hard Maria shifts her
gaze nervously from one to the other as if looking for help
from the first inspector

INT INTERROGATION ROOM — CONTINUOUS

The male inspector and female inspector lead Maria into a
sterile little room — about eight by eight - bare except for
the counter and a wooden BENCH The female inspector stands
behind her

FEMALE INSPECTOR 2
Place your hands on the wall Higher
Open your legs Don’t take your hands
off the wall

Maria does as she says The inspector pats Maria down — the
arms the back the breasts stomach crotch and legs front
and back

FEMALE INSPECTOR 2 (CONTD)
Please have a seat

Maria sits down on the bench

INSPECTOR
Give me both your shoes please

Maria does as he says The inspector checks each carefully
and then pierces the sole of one with a sharp awl as the
Female Inspector continues questioning Maria

FEMALE INSPECTOR 2
Maria Alvarez Is that your name

MARIA
Yes

FEMALE INSPECTOR 2
How old are you

MARIA
Eighteen

( )

FEMALE INSPECTOR 2
Is this your first time in this country

MARIA
Yes

FEMALE INSPECTOR 2

MARIA
With my sister

The Female Inspector looks at the first Inspector

FEMALE INSPECTOR 2
But before you said you were going to
stay with a friend Which is it with
your sister or with your friend

MARIA
With my sister

The male inspector sets her shoes aside

INSPECTOR
If we call her would she confirm that
you’re coming to visit

MARIA
--She doesn’t know I’m coming I was
going to surprise her We haven’t seen
each other in four years

FEMALE INSPECTOR 2

MARIA

( )

FEMALE INSPECTOR 2
How much did it cost

MARIA
-Like five hundred dollars

FEMALE INSPECTOR 2
Youre not sure

The inspectors look at each other

INSPECTOR
Tell me Maria what do you do in
Colombia

MARIA

Dethorning roses

FEMALE INSPECTOR 2

States

MARIA
No

FEMALE INSPECTOR 2
Do you want to know what I think I think
you’re bringing drugs into this country

MARIA
No

( )

FEMALE INSPECTOR 2
We have seen cases of people who carry
drugs inside their bodies Are you
carrying drugs in your stomach

MARIA
No

FEMALE INSPECTOR 2
(beat)
I want you to prove it to me I want you
to take an X-ray

She stares at Maria but Maria doesn’t flinch She then goes
to the counter and takes a sheet of paper from a stack

FEMALE INSPECTOR 2 (CONTD)
Please sign this document permitting us
to perform an X-ray

She gives Maria the form

MARIA
I don’t read English

INSPECTOR
It’s there in three languages

Maria reads the form takes a beat and then signs it
(printing her name like a child) The inspectors watch her
carefully

INSPECTOR (CONTD)

(playing the good cop)
Maria listen I’m going to be straight
with you If we do this X-ray and you’re
carrying drugs then we’re going to see it
immediately In that case it would be
much much better to tell us now That
way we can tell the judge you cooperated
and you’ll get less time in jail

FEMALE INSPECTOR 2
If you make us take the X-ray and you are
carrying then you’ll get ten years in
prison Minimum

INSPECTOR
Please Maria tell us the truth We
can’t help you if you don’t help us

MARIA
»I’m not carrying anything

The two inspectors look at one another trying to decide what
to do

INT BATHROOM — CONTINUOUS

In a tiny white-tiled institutional bathroom the female
inspector hands Maria a PLASTIC CUP

In front of the inspector Maria hikes up her skirt sits on
the toilet and pees into the cup

INT MEDICAL FACILITY — MAIN AREA
Maria sits in a corridor waiting

A door opens CONSTANZA steps out followed by another
inspector who sits her down opposite Maria

The two of them stare at each other Constanzas eyes are
puffy and red Shes clearly been crying

Through the open door Maria can see in a white-coated
TECHNICIAN examining an X-ray with another inspector He
takes out a pen and points to something There are scores of
pellets clearly visible in Constanza’s stomach and
intestines

The inspector takes the X-ray and walks over to Constanza
He handcuffs Constanza and leads her down the hall

Maria looks absolutely petrified Thirty feet away the two
inspectors that accompanied her are discussing something with
another white-coated technician They turn and look at Maria
and shake their heads — something is wrong

They walk toward Maria conversing with each other IN ENGLISH
FEMALE INSPECTOR 2
(in English)
What do you think
INSPECTOR
(in English)
Given the circumstances
Maria tries to glean what they’re saying They stare at her
INSPECTOR (CONTD)

(to Maria in Spanish)
Do you know that you’re pregnant

( )

MARIA
-Yes
(beat)
Will the X-ray hurt my baby

INSPECTOR
We don’t X-ray pregnant women

FEMALE INSPECTOR 2
But we can detain them

She says nothing

INSPECTOR

MARIA
»-The truth is a friend bought it for

MARIA
Franklin He’s my boyfriend He’s the

father of my baby

INSPECTOR
And he gave you the eight hundred
dollars too

MARIA
Yes for the baby

FEMALE INSPECTOR 2
(testing Maria once more)
--And does he know you swallowed drugs

MARIA
But I didn’t
(beat)
I’m not carrying drugs I’m just here to
see my sister I haven’t seen her in four
years I swear

The inspectors stare at each other trying to make a decision

INT AIRPORT ARRIVALS TERMINAL — LATER

Maria steps through the sliding door and into the waiting
area with her suitcase There are a small number of people
waiting on the side of the ropes Maria walks slowly through
them scanning the crowd for her contact No-one approaches
her

EXT AIRPORT TERMINAL — CONTINUOUS

Maria carries her bag out to the curb to look around She
sees a row of PAY PHONES and walks over to them She’s
contemplating what to do when suddenly her elbow is grabbed
from behind

A TALL GUY (WILSON) pulls Maria along taking her suitcase in
his other hand He drags her into the street where a VAN is
waiting He opens the sliding door throws her inside and
slams the door shut behind her

INT VAN — CONTINUOUS

Totally spun around Maria finds herself sitting next to LUCY
and BLANCA There are TWO GUYS (CARLOS and WILSON) in the
front - they look very YOUNG not more than 20 and have a
very nervous quality

CARLOS
(to Maria)
What happened to the other one

MARIA
They arrested her

CARLOS

Wilson starts the engine and pulls away fast Maria looks at
Lucy clearly ill and then at Blanca
INT HOTEL ROOM — CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)

The door opens - Wilson enters and flips on the light The
room is spare - two queen-sized beds and a TV

He sets down Lucy’s suitcase and goes to shut the blinds

while the girls enter Carlos sits in a chair sets down a
PLASTIC BAG and begins emptying his pockets

( )

CARLOS

here until you shit everything out

Maria and Lucy sit together on the edge of the bed Blanca
also sits

MARIA

He reaches into the bag and throws down FOIL PACKS OF
TABLETS

Lucy grabs for one of the foil packets greedily

BLANCA
What are they

CARLOS
A laxative To speed things up

LUCY
(standing)
I have to go to the bathroom

CARLOS

He removes a small box from the plastic sack and passes Lucy
two RUBBER GLOVES

( )

CARLOS (contd)
Don’t use the toilet I don’t want
anything accidentally going down the
drain And don’t forget the toothpaste -
I don’t want to be smelling your shit

over to the bed and makes himself comfortable

counts them through the plastic Wilson lies on the bed
watching TV Maria lies on her bed also watching Carlos
sits over by the window rolling himself a joint

Lucy squats at her suitcase folding a shirt - moving slowly -
Maria keeps one eye on her one on the TV She glances at
Wilson

Lucy sits on the chair and takes a deep breath

Without blinking Wilson clicks the remote a few times and
lands on something else a news report (in Spanish) about
crowds of people flocking to see an apparition of the Virgin
on the side of a tree As the news report ends Wilson
crosses himself kisses his crucifix and tucks it under his
shirt

Blanca crosses the room causing Maria to notice that Lucy
has dozed off sitting up

MARIA
Lucy Lucy Lucy

INT HOTEL ROOM — BATHROOM — MOMENTS LATER

In the bathroom Maria holds Lucy’s head under COLD WATER in

long moment in silence Maria strokes her hair

INT HOTEL ROOM — NEXT MORNING

CLOSE-UP on Maria sleeping We hear the sound of HUSHED
AGITATED VOICES off screen movement - there’s a shaft of
light as the bathroom door opens and then closes Maria
rolls over and opens her eyes a crack slow to adjust

In MARIAS POV — we see the two guys — one of them appears to
carry LUCY in his arms Maria sits up a little rubs her
eyes and refocuses

And in another snippet of MARIAS POV — we see the two guys
carrying Lucy ARGUING in a panicked whisper as they leave
the hotel room and shut the door behind them

Maria is totally unsure of what shes seen in her half-
sleeping-state She sits up in bed The room is strangely
quiet - the two guys are gone Lucy is gone Only Blanca lies
next to her asleep She gets up and goes to the bathroom

speaks into a headset) He finishes and looks in the rear-

SPEEDING OFF down the street leaving the two of them
standing there

They watch as it disappears around the corner Maria grabs
her bag and walks back over to the building but Blanca
continues to stand by the side of the street angry

As Maria tries the buzzer again an INDIAN WOMAN comes out of
the building and she catches the door

MARIA (CONTD)

The two of them stare each other down Blanca folds her arms
refusing to go in Finally Maria exasperated turns and
goes inside

Blanca grabs her suitcase and begins to carry it up the
street

INT BUILDING STAIRWELL — CONTINUOUS

Maria alone carries her suitcase up the staircase

She stops at the window and stares out then sits on the

sister’s apartment TEARS well up in her eyes She begins to
cry - BAWLING and TREMBLING like a baby - alone and abandoned
at the end of the long hallway

Maria quickly unbolts the door and opens it But instead of
Lucy WILSON and CARLOS from the hotel burst in and pin Maria
against the wall One of them rips at her shirt to reveal
her stomach The man opens his KNIFE and aims at Maria’s
belly which suddenly appears NINE MONTHS PREGNANT He
plunges the blade into her stomach PELLETS pour out of her
by the hundreds onto the floor and inside each one is little
fetus

IN BED Maria wakes suddenly from the NIGHTMARE to the sound
of the door closing and FOOTSTEPS She pretends to be asleep

He notices her lying there and then moves to the mattress
Maria opens one eye to see him take off his shirt and then

Carla looks at Maria - annoyed Maria looks back - caught

his 50s overweight - with a very friendly demeanor

There are about 6 CUSTOMERS crammed in there including an

people they don’t check papers so
carefully and they pay minimum wage

BLANCA
(suddenly)
Thank you for your help don Fernando

EXT ROOSEVELT AVENUE - LATER

Maria walks up the boulevard in an angry confused haze The
street is full of people Hispanic Chinese Indian She
peers into various shop windows a cheap jewelry store a
laundromat a Colombian coffee shop a Korean manicure shop
an electronics store She sees a Mexican guy at a corner
bodega unpacking flowers from a box that says “Product of
Colombia”

She buys an oblea from a street vendor As she sits and eats
it she looks across the street She notices a pregnant woman
coming out of a storefront with a sign - in English and in
Spanish - “WOMEN’S CLINIC”

INT MEDICAL CLINIC WAITING ROOM — CONTINUOUS

MARIA

I dont know Is it a big problem

DOCTOR

DOCTOR (CONTD)

Its important that you be very careful

a cigarette to your baby

She fiddles with the knobs on one of the monitors and begins

to pass the hand unit over Marias belly

Maria is entranced by the image of her baby on the screen
The doctor hits a few keys on the computer

blood is flowing well Im just going to
take a few measurements

MARIA
But everything’s OK right It looks
healthy

DOCTOR

room fills with the sound of the baby’s HEARTBEAT - Maria is
overwhelmed by it

printer in the exam room Maria sits up buttoning her top
button The doctor hands her the print She stares at it
for a moment — then smiles as tears come to her eyes

(on her way out)

behind a pile of papers

MARIA
Hello

DON FERNANDO
Come in

MARIA
I just wondered if you had any news

DON FERNANDO
Sit downI made a call to the Newark
morgue and they had some information

He turns to the fax machine and finds a fax in the pile

DON FERNANDO (contd)
They received the body of a woman
yesterday found in an abandoned field
under the expressway about two miles from
that hotel

MARIA
The body

DON FERNANDO
(carefully)
Her stomach was sliced open - they think
she was a mule They faxed me this
information and a picture of her face

( )

He hesitates before showing it to her It is indeed a poor
quality scratchy image of LUCY - her eyes closed her jaw
slack Maria GASPS

MARIA
Ay dios

DON FERNANDO

I’m sorry

(beat)
I have an undertaker I work with He’1l
go and get her and take care of
everything so that she can be sent home
to her family for a proper Christian
burial I need to know her name and
address back home

Maria is too choked up to speak

DON FERNANDO (CONTD)
(beat)
What is her name

MARIA
-Lucy Diaz

DON FERNANDO
Carla’s sister

MARIA
Yes but Carla doesn’t know She doesn’t
even know Lucy was doing it Lucy wanted
to come visit her

Carla leans back on her bed trying to get comfortable
There’s a BABY CRIB in the room which Maria admires Pablo is
in the kitchen

This is nice

CARLA
Hell probably sleep with us to start but
we saw it on sale

(MORE )

( )

CARLA (contd)
(beat)
What did don Fernando tell you

MARIA
WellHe said maybe he could find me
something sewing shirts

CARLA
What was the name of the place

MARIA
I don’t know

CARLA
(calling to Pablo)
Pablo what was the name of the place
where your friend worked sewing

PABLO (OS)
Frank and Sons I think

CARLA

(to Maria)
That’s it If it’s Frank and Sons tell
him to keep looking for something else
They treat you terribly and then they
don’t pay for weeks and weeks

(beat)
I asked about a job for you where I work

MARIA
You did

CARLA
They can’t guarantee work right off but
if someone calls in sick then they call
you and then eventually if someone quits
they might give you a regular job

MARIA
(starting slowly)
»-Carla I don’t really need a job

I’m going back home
Carla actually laughs Maria is taken aback
CARLA
You’re not going back child I know how
you feel When I first got here believe
me that was all I thought about

(MORE )

( )

CARLA (contd)
I remember on my grandmother’s birthday I
called home and I remember I could hear
everyone in the background yelling and
laughing and playing music and I remember
I was standing there on the street
holding the phone with tears streaming
down my face And my sister was asking
me ‘Hey how’s America Is it wonderful
How is your job’ And she’s talking
about how much she wants to come and be
with me And all I wanted was to tell
them how much I missed them and how hard
it was here but then I thought Who am I
to complain about how hard life is here

But it gets better trust me The best
moment of my life here - was when I got
my first paycheck Oh my god I will
never forget going into that office and
sending money home for the first time
You have no idea Your heart feels so
big so enormous like you can’t keep it
in your chest After a whole life of not
being able to do anything suddenly you’re
able to help and then you know they’re
counting on you back home looking up to
you and that keeps you going

Carla can’t hold back tears

But the real reason I stay is for my son
He’1ll have so many more opportunities
here I hate to say it but I can’t
imagine bringing up my baby in Colombia
now - not with the situation being what
it is It pains me to say it but it’s
true

Maria stares at her - not daring to say anything tears
welling up in her eyes

There’s a KNOCK on the front door

PABLO (0S)
I’1ll get it

CARLA
That must be your friend

determination in her eyes
