INT BATHROOM - DAY 1
A small potted plant a Ginkgo tree sits in a Japanese urn

MAYA (VO)
I know that many people believe in
fate and trust me there are times
I wish I was one of them

Pan off to the open door of a bathroom where MAYA DAVILLA
42 pretty fit stands under a running shower

MAYA (VO)
I tend to think our lives are
shaped by a series of choices one
decision leading to another and
another

INT BATHROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER 2
Maya combs out her hair in the mirror

MAYA
As far as I can tell it’s the
journey through all these decisions
that paints the clearest portrait
of who we really are

a candle on it

Maya sits at the vanity hair extensions in blowing on her
nail polish

TREY
You look hot

MAYA
I need to look professional

TREY
You do Relax okay Everybody
there loves you

MAYA
You need a bachelors degree to be a
manager

TREY

I’d argue fifteen years experience
is worth ten degrees not to
mention the Bernie Millman seal of
approval

MAYA
Thank you
(smiles he always knows
what to say)
We need to move your car

She heads out

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME 4

neighborhood streets

MAYA
To stand out in the big box

things differently

Maya stops at a light and looks over as a Mercedes SL pulls
up next to her She admires the car even as the business
woman in the front seat snaps orders into a phone then peels
away as the light changes

INT BODACIOUS BODEGA - DAY 7

Maya enters still rehearsing under her breath She grabs a
wrapped ham and egg from a spot beneath a small plastic palm
tree bearing a faded sign that reads MAYA’S HandM

MAYA
Thanks Justin

JUSTIN
(behind the counter)
You got it babe

EXT BODACIOUS BODEGA - DAY 8

Maya crosses the street and sits on a wooden city bench
beneath a tree Her world seems to slow as she eats
meditatively

forth across the pommel of the left arm rest before folding
the sandwich paper and with a deep breath--

MAYA

Kilimanjaro and only drink Rose

JOAN
Oh Them

MAYA
System’s rigged Doesn’t it
bother you that just because you

way
MAYA

had a chance

tables As a boy my favorite
stories were--

Maya rolls her eyes Arthur clocks it

ARTHUR (CONT’D)

Ms Davilla a minute

(steering her away)
I’m aware you wanted this position
and what’s more I sincerely believe
you deserved it For me this is
just a springboard into corporate

hard look at any policies that keep-—
out someone with your

(searching for the word)
--temerity

MAYA
Temerity

ARTHUR
It means spunk

MAYA
I know

ARTHUR

Yes Your ideas while rough still
have merit

MAYA
What’s rough about them

ARTHUR

But when you roll your eyes at me
you are trivializing a team
building exercise that I’m trying
to implement And that divides us

(then )
I don’t want to be the despot ruler
forced to replace old regimes
Youre my right hand and we’re all
at the same table

He beckons her back to the group
ARTHUR (CONT’D)
As I was saying I’d like us to

ZOE (mid-20s) cooly professional as she shakes Maya’s hand

ZOE
One of our best sellers

ANDERSON
Not anymore

22 22

MAYA
And not in the tri-state area

ANDERSON
Why do you think that is Maya

ZOE
It’s more of a seasonal--

MAYA
People only buy what they need

ZOE
People don’t know what they need
until they see it

MAYA
If people needed their floors to
smell like cherries I wouldn’t
have had to RMA thirty-six unsold
cases back to your distributor

HILDY
Development kicks off the new
quarterly cycle today so your

MAYA
What cycle

HILDY
It was men’s grooming but they
switched it to skin care at the
last second

MAYA
(“because of me”)
You’re kidding

HILDY
I don’t want this to sound like
anything but constructive advice--

MAYA
Shoot

Everyone takes their seats as Zoe enters

HILDY
(to Maya)
That’s “she who”
MAYA
Zoe right
HILDY
President of Global Skin and Personal
Care
MAYA
(I’m fucked” )
Oh wow

Zoe hits a button on an iPad and dozens of skin care
products appear on the four interactive screens behind her

ZOE
Some of you have already heard our
new mandate from on high
(audience mutters)
To replace our existing moisture
line with an organic alternative

The mutters turn to complaints as Zoe meets Maya’s eyes with
a hard stare - clearly the change wasn’t Zoe’s idea

MAYA
(“I’m really fucked”)
Oh wow
CHEMIST 1

It’s already all natural

( )

SI 37

ZOE
It needs to be more so

CHEMIST 2
By the end of this quarter Not
possible

RON
We’re not talking one hundred
percent green Just greener

More groans Until Anderson enters
ANDERSON
From the shrieks of wild
enthusiasm I take it Zoe’s just
broken the news

He takes Zoe’s hand and pecks her cheek

MAYA
Are you kidding me He’s old enough
to be her--
HILDY
Father Because he is
MAYA
(really really fucked”)
Oh wow
ZOE

(to Anderson)
You want to run this

ANDERSON

No no I just wanted to pop in and
formally introduce our newest hire

(he looks to Maya)
Maya Vargas is an extremely
accomplished consultant and the
new skincare direction was
partially based on her feedback
Maya

Maya stands briefly to small cold applause Then--

RON
Sir I think it’s an inspired idea
End of the quarter is aggressive
but we’re up to the challenge
aren’t we folks 37

He turns to the people in the audience eyebrows raising
sharply to compel their response which comes

ANDERSON
Excellent

RON
We’ll get to brainstorming though
it would be helpful to hear Maya’s
game plan

MAYA
Sorry

ZOE
Yes Maya Tell us where you think
the existing skin-care line falls
short

MAYA
Oh it’s not fully I don’t want
to offend

ZOE
(challenging)
How about you consult

MAYA
Okay
(then)
I think it’s a rip-off

People stir Hildy shifts slightly away from Maya

ZOE
Is that right

MAYA
I mean respectfully the company
was skewered when you tried to
convince people that Novalis was
some new hair growth product and it
came out that it was repackaged
shampoo

Zoe stiffens Ron is offended Anderson is intrigued
MAYA (CONTD)
They felt scammed So to repeat the
pattern

RON
--It’s not the same

37 37

MAYA

It’s close enough You don’t want
your consumers to lose faith in
you

(before he can speak)
I’m just saying aim higher You
can’t say “all-natural” on the
front of the bottle then have a
list of parabens and other
chemicals on the back--

FELIX HERRMAN 48 bald bespeckled and confident in his 25
years as a white-coated chemist

FELIX
All comfortably within FDA
guidelines

MAYA
People don’t want to “probably not”
get cancer from skin cream

RON
Launching an entirely new product
line is almost triple the cost of
evolving an existing one

MAYA
Ok I come from a different world

ANDERSON
Which is why we asked you to join
this one
(paces for several beats)
Why don’t we see who’s right

ZOE
I beg your pardon

ANDERSON
Zoe and Ron’s group will thread the
needle on profitably organic-—ifying
the current line And Maya and
Hildy will cook up something new

HILDY
Oh Christ

ANDERSON
All green Within our profit
margins Three months May the best
woman win

( ) 37

Zoe glares at Maya for a moment before she follows Anderson
out protesting as she exits

Maya sits back in her seat as Hildy and Ron exchange
exasperated looks

a plate filled with mashed potatoes

MAYA
So you went from MIT to
developing cat food

CHASE
Maybe I like cats

ARIANA
(to Maya)
Or maybe Felix exiled him

CHASE
Maybe Felix is an ass-—panda

Ariana catches his eye pointing to her face He’s got a glob
of potato above his lip He wipes the wrong spot

MAYA
Well he joined up with Zoe

Ariana shakes her head points again Chase wipes smearing
the potato across his lip like a pencil-thin mustache

CHASE

Everyone joined up with Zoe
MAYA

Except you Is that because of

Felix

Chase just shrugs

ARIANA

So here’s your chance to beat his

punk ass

She reaches across and wipes the potato from his face Both
he and Maya are startled

MAYA
So telling him I’m screwed up
because I gave my baby up for
adoption when I was seventeen is
gonna fix everything

JOAN
Oh right - it’s way better to lug
your past around like a cross and
bury your self-esteem in your
career than ever forgive yourself
for things that happened when you
were practically a child

Maya drops into the couch conflicted

JOAN (CONTD)
Uh oh Look what I’ve done I’ve
put you in a funk and I havent
even made you mad at me for jumping

HILDY (CONTD)

And it needs to fill a hole in the
market

ARIANA (0S)

It needs a ‘wow’ factor

CHASE
Why are you in the hall

HILDY
It’s not important

The ‘wow’ factor or the reason
she’s in the hall

MAYA
I think we need to be IN the

looking at sell throughs rates of
returns if we’re going to find a
hole in the market

HILDY
That’s going to eat up a lot of
time and we only have twelve weeks

MAYA
Your dad isunique

ZOE
He is that He’s brilliant and
competitive to the point of
occasional insanity but it’s made
him who he is

She trails off Maya reading her concern

MAYA
You worry about him

ZOE
I worry about some of his
decisions

Maya smiles at the reference

ZOE (CONT’D)
Especially since my mother passed
away

MAYA
I’m so sorry

ZOE
Six years he hasn’t been on a date
or a single vacation although I
finally talked him into selling the
apartment But still he’s always
on me about having more of a life
outside of work and yet he can’t
see the same about himself

MAYA
I lost my parents young My
grandmother raised me until she
died After that I ended up
bouncing around foster care which
wastough

ZOE
Is that why you never married or
had kids

MAYA

When you come out of that there’s
a lack of confidence that’s
implanted in you and you’d never
risk making someone else feel as
unwanted as you did

54 54

ZOE
Which makes all of your
accomplishments that much more
impressive

Maya accepts the kindness but cringes inside at the lie

ZOE (CONTD)

MAYA

Joan pulls out her phone and starts searching for a number

JOAN
Okay I’ve got an idea Remember
Dilly’s carpool friend Kevin Chow
from computer camp

MAYA

JOAN

Chinese clientele Fluent in
Mandarin

MAYA
And how does that help me
JOAN

If this works you will owe me big

time

MAYA
Really feel for any swelling
(then in English)
But I feel badly we’re leaving
everyone out of the conversation
I’m sure your English is better
than my Mandarin

JIANG
I suspect it might be

ZOE
We would love to schedule a tour
for you and your colleagues to
visit our facilities first hand

RON
But of course we have to wait until
the deal is closed due to the
proprietary nature of RandD

ZOE
As long as there is a signed a non-
disclosure agreement I’m perfectly
comfortable allowing Mr Jiang to
tour

RON
You may not be aware Zoe but that
directly contradicts company
policy I’m sure Mr Jiang can
understand that

A tense beat at the table Jiang looks at Maya
JIANG
(In Mandarin)
Tell me Im having a tough time
dealing with Ron I like everyone

at FandC but I find him arrogant
Whats his problem

ZOE
Ron’s only happy when someone else

So hows your project coming

MAYA
Honestly Slow Wish I didn’t open
my big mouth

ZOE
Yeah a hundred percent organic is
tough I took a run at it a few
years ago I still have a lot of
data at my dad’s place I moved out
a few months ago but if you don’t
mind helping me dig for it the
research might save you a few
headaches

MAYA
(taken aback)
That actually would be very
helpful

ZOE

It’s the least I can do for you
making Ron look like a dick

Off Maya’s smile

Zoe pulls out a FADED ENVELOPE Maya’s face goes white
recognizing it She looks up at Zoe in disbelief

ZOE (CONT’D)

“I will always watch over you”

She looks up at Zoe with tears in her eyes Zoe swallows
hard Tears fill her eyes as well

MAYA (CONTD)
Oh my god

ZOE
You’re my mother aren’t you

Maya backs away overwhelmed by more than twenty years of
fear and guilt surging through her

ZOE (CONTD)
I just found out myself

It’s several moments before Maya can begin to compose herself
and almost involuntarily she steps to Zoe and hugs her hard
feeling Zoe’s shoulders and head with her hands

MAYA
Oh my god

Tears stream down Zoe’s face at Maya’s primal reaction They
part then--

MAYA (CONTD)
How

ZOE
My dad I’m completely pissed at
him For years after my mom
died I tried to find you It was
just a series of dead ends I sorta
gave up But apparently he didn’t

of you

MAYA
You don’t have to

ZOE
Oh yes he does

ANDERSON

We used to say Zoe got her spirited
streak from her mother now we know
that was only half true

(Maya laughs)
When Zoe started looking for you I
didn’t know if it was healthy or
not but she wasn’t exactly asking
my permission After a while she
gave up and

(to Zoe quelling his

emotions)
--something went out in you I
know what your mother would have
said “Fix it Andy” so I kept the
feelers out

(to Maya)
And suddenly almost magically
there you were online formidably
so I had no idea if you’d want to
have contact with Zoe and I
couldn’t risk her being rejected
so after reading your resume I

ZOE
Manipulated us

ANDERSON

(he gestures mea culpa)
One day god willing you’1ll
understand the lengths a parent
will go to for their child’s
happiness Besides for all I knew
Maya could have been a serial
killer

MAYA
Well you still haven’t seen what’s
in my basement

ANDERSON
(chuckles then)
I did lie though To both of you

idea He wanted me to cheat the

repackaging shampoo as a hair growth
product But I wouldn’t do it

MAYA
So he let you keep your job if you
kept quiet but sent you to
Siberia
(off Chase’s painful nod)
So why didn’t you quit

MAYA
When I was a little girl my grandma
gave me this potted plant and told
me this story After we dropped the
bomb the military sent a team to
Japan to make sure the radiation had
depleted The only thing they found
that hadn’t been destroyed was one
single living tree

CHASE
Still wondering about your alcohol
intake Should you be driving

MAYA
The leaves were already growing
back A month later it flowered
The citizens built a temple around
it and the soldiers took clippings
from it One of those soldiers was
my grandpa

She pulls onto a familiar street and parks the car

CHASE
Okay What kind of tree was it

MAYA

The Japanese call it gin kyo which
means silver apricot

INT MAYA’S OFFICE - NEXT MORNING 103

HILDY
And this will undoubtedly set you
back a bit but as the ancient
proverb says “Man makes plans and
then the Big Man takes a poop on
them” N’est pas

ARIANA
I don’t think that’s how it goes

MAYA
So youre leaving us for Ron

HILDY
It’s not because everyone thinks
you’re delusional to try and invent
a whole new product with three
weeks to go It’s just Ron
values me Plus when his assistant
DE got colitis it just seemed
too good to be true

As Hildy goes to the door she turns for one final comment
when Ariana interrupts

Ariana SLAMS the door in Hildy’s face

ARIANA (CONT’D)

INT LAB - DAY 104

A Chemist carefully grinds leaves before feathering them into
a mixer filled with a churning green emulsion

CHASE

First we emulsify the leaves and
mix them with different base
compounds

(re a thermometer)
Then we give it a few hours to see
if it’ll homogenize And then we
begin the ultra-violet light tests
to see if it works

MAYA
What if it doesn’t

TECHNICIAN
Youre screwed

ARIANA
It ain’t over ‘til it’s over

MAYA
(smiles reminded of Trey)
That’s right How long could this

take

taps her shoulder She startles awake

With everyone wearing glasses now Chase flips a switch and

Interested to see what you got

MAYA

I think you’1l be impressed
RON

Haven’t been so far

I’m not fond of liars Maya

Maya stares him down what does he know

RON (CONT’D)
Everything checks out but it
doesn’t add up

(then)
I really don’t care how you got
here Maria Vargas Because the one
thing you and I both know is that
you don’t belong

He walks away Off Maya we--

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING 113

Filled with technicians executives assistants Members of
the BOARD sit in the front row

ANDERSON
I’ve tasked two teams with two
different challenges Zoe’s team
set out to create an slightly more
organic alternate to an existing
product line while Maya’s task was
to create a completely new one A
totally green line Zoe

Zoe steps forward Hildy passes out test results

ZOE
Thank you If a picture is worth a
thousand words then these test
results should be priceless You
asked us to re-purpose one organic
line we made you two Skin care

She pulls a sheet off a line of products then nods to Ron

RON
And make-up

113

Ron pulls a sheet off a second line of products
Anderson like everyone is impressed

HILDY
What can I say we’re over
achievers

Ariana and Maya exchange a look as people pore over stats

ANDERSON
Are these numbers right

RON
Yes With a minimal cost we made
our products six percent more
organic than our previous line

ZOE
We estimate we can raise our price
per unit by four percent and
increase our annual skin care
revenue by twenty-three million

The room applauds Hildy takes this in satisfied

ANDERSON
Very impressive Zoe Ron and

Hildy jumps up

HILDY
Hildy Ostrander Thrilled to be
part of all this

ANDERSON
Okay then
(turns to Maya)
Maya Your ball

Maya steps up

MAYA
Well my partners Chase Iskowitz
Ariana Ng--
(Hildy rolls her eyes)

--and I have challenged ourselves
to think outside the box And in
keeping with that theme we’d like
to move our presentation outside

Zoe Ron and the rest of the board look confused

EXT CENTRAL PARK - DAY 114

A display table covered with a table cloth has been set up
underneath a FLOWERING TREE with a big desk top computer
screen The board members as well as Zoe’s team watch
intrigued as they stand adjacent to the road

Before Maya begins Ariana leans in to Maya and whispers-—-

ARIANA
Everything’s ready

MAYA
(quietly concerned)
Okay But I still don’t think we
need--

ARIANA
--please Every great presentation
needs a ‘wow’ factor Trust me

Maya looks at Ariana then Chase She smiles with her
reassurance and nods Maya then turns to the group--

MAYA
We’re standing here beneath this
tree for a very special reason
Sometimes the simplest answers to
complicated questions are right in
front of us Consumers are always
looking for something natural and
real but they are confused by the
amount of choices out there

She nods to Ariana who cues the graphics on the screen

MAYA (CONT’D)
Words like Paralyzed””Confused”
“Lost” kept popping up in our
research I’m sure youll all agree
that we don’t want to be caught
holding the bag with thirty-four
percent of the inventory when the
crash comes

RON
What crash

MAYA
The one that’s already happening
People feel ripped off We use one
bar of soap for our whole body why
is our face sub-divided

( )

114 114

Zoe looks intrigued

RON
Uh because we can make more money

A few board members laugh Zoe bristles at Ron’s sarcasm

MAYA
I think FandC has an opportunity to
double our market share by giving
people what they want and what they
need one organic product that does
it all And that product comes from
this very Ginkgo tree

She uncovers a small jar on the table with a simple Ginkgo
leaf logo

MAYA (CONTD)
All-In-One Ginkgo Cream

Anderson looks very impressed Maya cues Ariana as--

MAYA (CONTD)
It’s a revolutionary idea that we
think--

Chase pulls back the table cloth so that Ariana can reach
into a cage filled with doves

MAYA (CONTD)
--is really going to take off

Ariana and Chase grab several of the cute birds

MAYA (CONTD)
--and signify a new era in skin
care

Ariana and Chase release the doves that start to fly out into
the park then circle the tree

MAYA (CONTD)
--filled with the hopes and dreams
of every woman to look rejuvenated
while being protected by a product
that will naturally and delicately
care for their beauty

The doves swoop back over the group and out to the road where

a TRUCK drives by and SMACKS into them in an explosion of
white feathers

Off the horrified looks from the board--

ARIANA
Oh

out to be a good idea and we got

MAYA

Thank you Zoe Anderson Thank you
for giving me a chance Not
everyone in corporate America does
that There are people out there
who were never given an opportunity
because they couldn’t afford the
right college and never got that
degree that would open the door
And you’re right Zoe maybe I did
get where I am today because I
wasn’t afraid to tell the truth
Even if it hurts
