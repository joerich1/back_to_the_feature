I SAW THE LIGHT

BLACK SCREEN A SONG

“ another love before my time
made your heart sad and blue and so
my heart is paying now for things I
didn’t do

AS THE DEEP BLACK TURNS SMOKY GREY we are

Somewhere in southern Alabama Sometime past midnight Some
time around 1950 And though it’s impossible to clearly make
out details it feels like what it is a sweaty HONKY TONK

Camera floats like a moth around the beautiful and hypnotic
face past the dark haunted eyes of a 27 year-old man who
somehow even in this first moment feels like hes at least 20
years older HIRAM “HANK” WILLIAMS born in a speck of a town
poorer than is imaginable

Glimpses of his ever present cowboy hat A small stately
Stetson His fancy western suit sweat stained collar and
missing rhinestones Not because he can’t afford to fix them
he just doesnt have the time Hank is burning through the
days and nights with a fever that will scorch you

The voice is confident and ancient and yet supple like a
child But mostly it is so damn personal that every person
who hears it thinks it belongs to them And of course it is
sad Sadder than anyone has ever heard The song is “Cold
Cold Heart”

HANK

“In anger unkind words are said
that make the tear drops start
How can I free your doubtful mind
and melt your cold cold heart”

The strains of Hank’s lament play under the opening of the
next scene and then as speaking voices come up it dies out

73 MILES SOUTH OF MONTGOMERY
ANDALUSIA ALABAMA DECEMBER 151944
EXT TEXACO STATION - NIGHT

A light rain A SERVICE BAY In the BG a YOUNG ATTENDANT

HANK a handsome lanky 22 year-old holds a cowboy hat He
stares into the eyes of AUDREY MAE SHEPHERD GUY 23 A good-
looking blonde with a hard side and a wicked smile

BOYETTE

Hank nods smiles Boyette’s greased-stained hands pick up a
sheaf of papers and flips through them

BOYETTE (cont’d)
Hmmm couple more little Justice

Audrey takes a long look at the papers before answering

AUDREY

Erksine’s surname

BOYETTE

order right

AUDREY
They definitely are Mr Guy and I
took care of that You’1ll take

She squeezes Hank’s hand in reassurance He squeezes it back
Their faces reveal a couple deeply in love

BOYETTE

I see that Just 10 days ago huh

(sets the papers aside

picks up a Bible)
Well to the business at hand Just
because the ceilings arent vaulted
and the windows arent stained
glass doesnt mean that this union
is any less sacred Now before I

and wife is there anyone here
who has an objection if so go
ahead and speak your peace

The attendant enters

ATTENDANT

Laughter

By authority vested in me for the
County of Covington state of
Alabama I declare you husband and
wife You may embrace

Which Hank does Long and hard

INT KITCHEN - LILLIE WILLIAM’S BOARDING HOUSE - MONTGOMERY

Good sized kitchen as befits a BOARDING HOUSE likely built in
the late 1890’s Large table a lot of linoleum some smoke
wafting about and Audrey at the stove

AUDREY
(singing)
“ By a stream upon a meadow
Under clouds white as snow
I dreamt about you baby
Even though you let me go”
(takes a drink from a
beer)
Whatya’ think

Hank stretched out between two chairs boots off reads a
Ranch Romance PULP COMIC BOOK A five year-old girl LYCRECIA
(Audreys daughter from her first marriage)sits on his lap
trying to grab the comic But Hank is actually reading and
liking it They tussle for it

A plain pocket-sized overstuffed NOTEBOOK lies open next to
him There’s an empty beer bottle on the table and hes
drinking from another

Hank doesnt answer instead takes a swig

HANK
How long it’s been since Lycrecia
saw her daddy

AUDREY

Hes gonna stop by next week when
she’s at mommy and dads

(back to singing)
“ My heart is oh so heavy
And my tears no longer glow
I dreamt about you baby
Even though you let me go” So

HANK
It’s fine baby

AUDREY
Fine

HANK

Yeah fine

As she puts a plate of overcooked collared greens on the
table a MAN 50ish walks into the kitchen

AUDREY
(rough)
Who are you

MAN
Raymond Wallingford I’m a new
boarder are you Miss Lillie
AUDREY

(nods towards Hank)
Do I look like his mother

MAN

Wallingford spins quickly exits

fella

Hank sets Lycrecia aside keeps reading the comic Hes
really enjoying it Laughs as he takes a bite

AUDREY
How’s the stew

HANK

Gets up grabs another beer from the fridge stumbles over a
bottle and walks out the back door and down wooden steps to
the yard

HANK

EXT BOARDING HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

AUDREY (0S)
(from inside)
You think youre so high and mighty
and it’s all you Well I got
ambition too and YOU quit
goddamn acting like I can’t sing

Hank lights a cig his back to the door Suddenly one of his
boots nails him in the back He calmly bends down and picks
it up The other one sails out He just puts it on and moves
out of range

HANK
(calling out)
Yeah thats a helluva song Audrey
now why dont you work on your
sense of humor

INT ROADHOUSE CLUB - NIGHT

Decent crowd Music is number three on the list of important
things in a joint like this 1) illegal liquor 2) fighting
then music

HANK (0S)
(POSSIBLY HONKY TONK BLUES
HERE INSTEAD)
“And well go honky tonkin’ honey
baby honky tonkin’ honey baby
Well go honky tonkin’ around this
town

Camera SNAKES THROUGH THE CROWD that has the air of danger
that comes after midnight on a state highway in the middle of
the summer Heavy smoke parts REVEALING creased faces and
dirty fingernails sandpaper hands cup beers and coke bottles
filled with cheap clear whiskey

HANK (contd)
When you and your baby have a
falling out
Call me up sweet mama and we’ll go
stepping out and
Well go honky tonkin’ ‘round this
town ”

These are young rugged farmers and factory workers in their

20s watching their women eat up Hank while they stroke
their girl’s thighs

HANK ON STAGE He wears a Stetson a regular suit anda
loosened tie Behind him is a version of his band the
DRIFTING COWBOYS Through the years the name would always
stay the same but the players would change 20 times For now
DON HELMS 20S on pedal steel guitar and LUM YORK 20S on
bass JERRY RIVERS 20s and one other player (considering
Sammy Pruitt)

Hank hunches over the microphone all 150 pounds of him As
he sings his knees buckle his hips thrust For these days
it’s unique Visceral And the sexuality cannot be denied He
yodels a WOMAN shrieks Rest of crowd laughs at that

IN THE WINGS is Hank’s MOTHER LILLIE 40’s intense
formidable and nearly as tall as her 6 foot son She wears a
simple black dress and ARGUES with Audrey They don’t now
and never have liked each other

Lillie FLIPS THROUGH the last bills of “tonight’s take Then
actually starts counting the crowd

AUDREY
How much we got there Miss Lillie

LILLIE
I’m under no obligation to you

AUDREY
Right that goes both ways he’s
drinking like a fish tonight

LILLIE
You think so

ON HANK Finishes the song glimpses over at the two of them
Nods for Audrey to join him She’s pleased Lillie’s not

AUDREY
Don’t worry Lillie Hank will hand
it over to me before we even get
home

LILLIE
Id be careful little girl that’s
a tinder box out there

Hank grabs a coke bottle full of liquor off the floor Nearly
falls as he does Big swig then drapes his arm around
Audrey He kisses her cheek she leans into him They roll
into “BLUES COME AROUND” together

A SCARY GUY stands up in the crowd

SCARY GUY
Hey Williams you sound like a
billy goat So does she

Hank ignores him

AUDREY

Hank shakes his head at her She knows better The Man’s WIFE
pulls him back to his seat

SCARY GUY
So you hidin’ behind a woman
You hear me you you skinny little
shit

Hank stops shares a look with Audrey a quick glance at
Helms then to the heckler

HANK
No I can’t hear you

Starts the song again GUY stands up again

SCARY GUY
every morning when my wife
wakes up she’s listens to you on
the damn radio if she’s listening
tomorrow mornin’ I’m gonna beat the
hell out of her

Hank casually nods Audrey to step away She hesitates but
does

HANK
(smiles)
Well partner why dont you just
turn the damn thing off thats

why they put knobs on it

Audience laughs The GUY explodes CHARGES the stage pushes
people out of the way Hank shows no fear just carefully
sets down his guitar goes straight for the LEG OF DON’S
STEEL GUITAR

Crowd SCATTERS the SCARY GUY trips almost falls gets to
the stage jumps up and dives for Hank He just barely grabs
Hank’s PANTS LEG and pulls him to the floor But as Hank goes
down he WAILS on the SCARY GUY with the steel guitar leg It
all gets bloody Now Lillie wades in with her fists pumping
as Don and Lum try to separate them

INT LILLIE’S BOARDING HOUSE BEDROOM - DAWN

Only a touch of morning light Hank snores heavily His
pillow is spotted with blood He has a Band-Aid on his cheek

Hank now barely visible in the backseat Hat pulled over his
eyes

HANK

this

LILLIE

INT FRED ROSES OFFICE - DAY

FRED ROSE

mid 40’s slight widows peak a keen visage that

has no trouble holding an intense gaze That said his smile
when revealed is warm There’s a piano in the office He
sits on swivel desk chair looking straight at us

Fred is being interviewed by a reporter WHO WILL NEVER BE
SEEN ON CAMERA His voice will be intelligible but muffled

FRED ROSE
Since youre asking me I think
basically it’s impossible to
understand why or what happens when
an artist or performer captures
people’s imagination The drums
start to beat and the message moves
across the mountains Of course
there’s no shortage of managers or
publishers or press for that
matter explaining why so and so is
hot or proclaiming this fellow is
going to be a star That’s an
opinion (beat)and I’m familiar
with a lot of them

INTERVIEWER
But you obviously thought Hank had
something

FRED ROSE
Yes I did It would have been hard
not to

(MORE)

JUMP CUT

JUMP CUT

FRED ROSE (contd)
When he first came to see me he
played some of the songs he’d
written and some other folks
material too (Takes a beat)
Actually I believe Audrey his
wife had been calling here quite a
bit pushing me to see him
Anyway I offered him a contract
right then and there as a song
writer Twenty dollars a song I
believe

INTERVIEWER
and to be clear you’re a song
publisher here in Nashville

FRED ROSE

Yes (laughs) I was originally a
song and dance man from St Louis
via New York but yes Roy Acuff
who as you know has been a big Opry
star for quite some time we
have a company

(thinking smiling)
I really liked Hank right off
Maybe it was because he didnt give
a darn whether you liked him or
not

INTERVIEWER
Don Helms says you’re the only one
who he’d really listen to about his
music

FRED ROSE
Let’s put it this way he would
listen to me That doesnt mean he
heard

INTERVIEWER
Did you see or rather what did you
know about his problems

FRED ROSE
All Ill say is as a young man I
was personally no stranger to
similar troubles myself

EXT ALABAMA ROAD - LATE AFTERNOONDUSK
A ‘42 Plymouth rolls across a country bridge

FRED ROSE (V0O)

So I told him I was a Christian
Scientist which he was not likely
not to know and we assert that
humanity is spiritual rather than
material That that faith has
helped me through some dark times

and he should call me if he
needed me

royalties

DON
Officially a paid songwriter

HANK
That’s right so I suggest you
address me as Mr Hiram Williams

Audrey leans over tips up his baseball type cap

DON
Where the hell did “Hiram” come
from

HANK

My old man Got it from King Hiram
in the Book of Kings And then
misspelled it on the birth
certificate Put in an extra “I”
That’s why they used to call me
“Harm”

AUDREY
Boy Lillie never mentions your
daddy at all like he never
existed

HANK
Well she put him in the Veterans
Hospital in Pensacola when I was
six War injury from France or
something but some cousin told me
it was from a truck accident at the
lumber yard Anyway he was messed
up and that was about it for us
after that well I was pretty
much my own daddy

Audrey takes a beat strokes his temple

Silence from everyone as they stare past him

“thanks”

HANK

your fur coat and answer the

A beat as Hank watches her disappear

HANK

Then he kicks a chair halfway down the hall

This all echoes as “They’ll Never Take Her Love From Me” or
an Alt - begins to play underneath

EXT PENSACOLA FLORIDA MOTEL - DAY

Hank unshaven beat sits on a MOTEL BALCONY overlooking the
ocean in PENSACOLA eighty miles south of Montgomery The
winds gust sun washes his face sand blows whitecaps

In his hand is a half crumpled letter As he reads it and
this is clearly not the first time Fred Rose’s voice comes

up

LETTERFRED ROSE (VO)
“Dear Hank I feel kinda let down
today after receiving your call
‘cause I knew you were drinking
again and Hank that is something I
refuse to go for because it only
proves a man’s weakness

The hard sun sinks heavy as it nears the water

LETTERFRED ROSE (VO)
if you want Audrey back get a
haircut and buy a new suit wash
your face and throw that damn
whisky bottle out the window

He drops the letter stumbles to the bed sits unsteadily
But Fred’s voice still resonates

LETTERFRED ROSE (V0O)
If you think you want to straighten
out and let me take care of
business as I have been doing sign
the enclosed contracts have them

notarized
(MORE)

LETTERFRED ROSE (VO) (contd)
If you feel sorry for yourself and
keep drinking then just tear them
up and forget the whole deal”

He closes his eyes The screen goes DARK WITH THEM

When he opens his eyes he’s staring into an ANIMAL HIDE

The FUR COAT he gave Audrey but wrapped around a NAKED WOMAN
of 25 She pulls it open leans down kisses his pained
forehead Hands him a sweating beer bottle

PENSACOLA WOMAN
Why dont we spread this little fox
over there and have a lay down

Hank smiles takes a sip Then the bottle DROPS from his
hand slowly spilling over the sheets

“Why Don’t You Love Me or ALT” fades out

Shaking For the first time we notice his hair is thinning

the bench sits a young girl lost in her own thoughts

Hank paces looks out the front window waiting Turns to the
receptionist rubbing his freshly shaved face

Boston Baked Beans Hank half smiles at the candy looks
behind Don then they stare at each other Don noticeably
uncomfortable

A BANKER enters behind him carrying an envelope Hank
continues reading without acknowledging the man

which come into his hands ”

Banker hates listening to this Hank finally sets them down

BANKER

BANKER

this in PULL BACK he stands in front of a Coke machine He
puts in a dime takes the Coke from the machine As he tries
to pop the bottle cap another scream The bottle drops to

INT HANK and AUDREY’S APT JUNIOR’S ROOM - NIGHT

Hank walks down a dimly lit hallway towards the weeping of
his son

He enters the baby’s tiny bedroom Gently lifts him out of
the crib he shares with a giant Teddy Bear No chance this
stops the crying Hank holds him close and strokes his head

HANK
(softly)
Oh little one come on now
Bocephus Daddy’s here it’s
alright it’s alright

In the muted light his baby against his shoulder Hank’s

youth is suddenly so apparent He’s just another 26 year-old
father trying to calm his little one and probably can’t

Hank slowly lowers himself to the floor leans against the
wall and starts doing what he was born to do slow and oh
so gently as a lullaby

HANK (contd)
I wandered so aimless life filled
with sin
I wouldn’t let my dear savior in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in
the night
Praise the Lord I saw the light

But Hank has to smile because this has absolutely no effect
on Junior

Then he looks up as Audrey has JOINED him in singing the
next refrain Together they serenade their newborn

Audrey in her robe stares down at them with true affection
She reaches for the baby Hank carefully hands him to her

HANK (contd)
Well he was sleepin’ pretty good
there for a few days I guess
they finally put the batteries in

Audrey manages a sleep deprived grin and pats Junior’s back
He begins to calm After a moment

HANK (contd)
He sure likes his mama

She just smiles He puts his arms around both of them then
after a beats whispers

HANK (CONT’D (contd)

BURSTS THROUGH

and we’re proud to give a
rousing welcome to the “Lovesick
Blues” boy Hank Williams

CRASH INTO
INT RYMAN AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

From the REAR OF THE STAGE looking out Hank framed from the
back silhouetted against the packed former church

Tennessee hot and humid Half the people are fanning
themselves with fans advertising a Funeral Parlour

Working people their families with them Mopping the sweat
straining to see Folks are asking each other “Who”

For a moment Hank is motionless The tension builds

His lanky frame hunches over the mic He slowly settles the
guitar strap around his neck He stretches out his left arm
holds the guitar stiffly away from his body Then with force
and magnetism he strikes the first chords

On top of it comes the BEAUTIFUL TWANG of the STEEL GUITAR -
cuts straight to the heart of every soul there

HANK
“ I gotta feeling called the
bluuuuuuues oh Lawd since my baby
said goodbye
Lawd don’t know what Ill
doooooo0o0o all I do is just sit and
sigh
That last long day she said goodbye
Well Lawd I thought I would cry
Shed do me shed do you
Shes got that kind of lovin
Lawd I love to hear her
When she calls me sweet daddy”

SHOUTING now Screams from the girls even the women Hank
smiles Genuine Too long in coming

And then it’s over He doffs his hat to an audience that is
clamoring for more

Not sure what to do Hank looks backstage Searches the faces
of the Opry regulars who ALL seem to be watching He finds
smiles laughter approval

ON FRED who takes this in as well Opry bosses JIM DENNY
and HARRY STONE stand next to him Nod in respect RED FOLEY
the ANNOUNCER steps out raises his hand to stop the
applause Doesnt work And so the pedal steel TWANGS once
more and leads into an encore

DISSOLVE TO

40s He is listening to

A record that’s playing but the song is SPOKEN as a ‘poem’
Hank recorded these recitations as LUKE THE DRIFTER

HANK

(spoken with minimum

accompaniment)
“You’1l meet a man just like me
along life’s busy street
With shoulders stooped and heads
bowed low and eyes that stare in
defeat
For souls that live within the
past where sorrow plays all the
parts
For a livin’ death is all thats
left for men with broken hearts”

FRANK like Fred Rose is being interviewed by the reporter
we never see on camera Come in mid sentence

FRANK WALKER
We didnt and neither did Fred
want to put these recitations out
under Hank’s name Not really
jukebox material So we compromised
and he released several songs under
the pseudonym of “Luke the
Drifter”

REPORTER (0C)
How did they do

FRANK WALKER
They didn’t sell well but they
seemed to offer Hank emotional
relief Fred said “They were
almost apologies”

REPORTER (0C)
Could you tell us who you are

FRANK WALKER
Frank Walker I run MGM Records and
I signed Hank Williams to a
contract two years ago in 1947
(MORE)

FRANK WALKER (contd)
Hank’s first record for us was
“Move It On Over” Our second
session he recorded “I Saw The
Light”

money selling records and writing
songs several years now of
more than 100000 dollars

smiling laughing sweating smoking

His blurred gaze drops to the floor He leans on the mic The
crowd starts clapping He looks back at Don who is not sure
what to play then turns back to the crowd

HANK
You know friends I wonder how many
homes are broken tonight just how
many tears are shed by some word of
anger that never should have been

said

(struggling)
Hmmm folks hey do any
of you out there know my very good
friend Luke the Drifter well

Luke wrote these words

Audience is now both captivated and confused

HANK (contd)
Id like to tell you a story of a
family I once knew
Well call ‘em Mary and William and
their little girl Sue
Now Mary was just a plain mother
and Bill well he was just a usual
Dad and they had their family
quarrels like everybody else But
neither one really got mad
Then one day summin happened it
was nothing of course but one word
led to another and the last word
led to divorce

The band just stares along with everyone else And Hank just
drops his head stops his drugged preaching and stands there
totally alone

friend maybe been too reluctant
to speak up about some things hard

HANK (cont’d)
You know my Uncle told me that
Grant was drunk every afternoon by
300 but he still took

HANK
See ya

Hank climbs slowly out and walks towards the entrance

INT NASHVILLE GENERAL HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING

Audrey sleeps A half-eaten tray of food next to her No

You dont have a damn clue

He tries to make sense of this He’s swimming
AUDREY (cont’d)
You did this to me Hank Williams

Youre the bastard caused me to
suffer like this

HANK
What are you saying

AUDREY
Youre barely here Youre barely
even a father now and you can’t
handle being more of one

HANK
My god what did you do You
can’t you can’t do that without
me

AUDREY

It’s done We got nothing
You and I got nothin’

Hank squeezes his eyes shut so hard so pained hoping when
he opens them he’s not even here The flowers lay across his
lap

INT FRED ROSES OFFICE - DAY
Another time same Interview style -

A RECORD is carefully placed on a turntable The NEEDLE drops
on “Cold Cold Heart

For 15 SECONDS Just the simple glory and crippling heartache
only Hank could render

HANK
“Another love before my time made
your heart sad and blue
And so my heart is paying now for
things I didn’t do ”

From the spinning record to Fred’s face

“In anger unkind words are said
that make the tear drops start
How can I free your doubtful mind
and melt your cold cold heart”

FRED ROSE
What a truly powerful song If I
was a betting man which I’m not
Id say three times a week we get a
request to record it Tony Bennett
for one did a heckuva rendition
» you probably know that

REPORTER
Did Hank enjoy other performers
doing his songs

FRED ROSE
He loved it If he came across a
jukebox with a Tony Bennett
version he’d play it over and
over

REPORTER
Well to say the least it’s a very
sad and painful song Where do you
think that came from

FRED ROSE
Being an artist doing the
writing the composing the real
work that itself can be pretty
painful But I can’t really say
family’s have pain men and
women cause each other pain
there’s physical pain but
turning it into a poem like that I
don’t know

REPORTER
You think he enjoyed his success

FRED ROSE
I dont believe it mattered much to
him He wanted the Opry and he got
it But beyond that whether a song
was number one or fifty he
cared a lot more about just doing
what he wanted to do

REPORTER
And the money The Wall Street
Journal had his earnings at 150
thousand last year

FRED ROSE
People like money Some a lot more
than others Some it’s a way to
keep score He was fine just not
having to think about it He didnt
do what he did for money

JUMP CUT

FRED ROSE (contd)
The thing with Hank he couldnt
stop writing he couldnt stop
working Whatever he had inside him
he just had to get it out and
of a body that was as frail as a
baby’s

straw

JAMES DOLAN
No of course not It’s very
popular

HANK
Uh huh

JAMES DOLAN

minds You do what I do get where
I am you see plenty of that
People thinking they’1l make a nice
pie with a slice of me

JAMES DOLAN
Well I’m only looking to give

I write and sing because thats
what I do Not much choice really

JAMES DOLAN
As an artist

HANK
Your word

Drink arrives Hank takes a swig Looks past Dolan to see
Sammy and Don watching him

JAMES DOLAN
But you are offering your fans
something What would you say that
is

HANK
Mr Dolan everybody has a little
darkness in them They may not like
it don’t want to know about it
but it’s there I show it to them
They touch it but they don’t
have to take it home with them

JAMES DOLAN

Do you think that’s what they
expect from you

HANK
They expect I can help their
troubles I know because they write
me and tell me about them If their
husband dies and they’re left with
eight starving kids They write If
their sweetheart done them wrong
They write I dunno know but I
reckon they think Im some sort of
red cross

Nolan laughs Hank half-smiles takes another swig

HANK (contd)
Folk music hillbilly it’s
sincere Nothing phony Man sings a
sad song he knows the ‘sad’

JAMES DOLAN
Right
(writes this down then)
Let me see how to put this
theres well a lot of speculation
about the hard lives that western
or folk singers live

HANK
What do you mean hard

JAMES DOLAN
Well more like the women whiskey

HANK
If you’re getting at something
then get at it

Dolan’s gaze goes to the whiskey in Hank’s hand With Hank
staring straight through him Dolan thinks about it

JAMES DOLAN
There are a lot of rumors Mr
Williams that you have struggled
with alcohol

HANK
Didnt know you were in the rumor
business

JAMES DOLAN
I don’t mean to offend you

HANK
- but since you obviously are
why don’t you just say they’re all
true every one of them make it
easy

JAMES DOLAN
That’s not what I do Mr Williams

HANK
Mr Dolan you can do whatever you
wanna do but I’m done doing this

Hank gives him a hard smile stands and still HOLDING HIS

GLASS walks slowly past Dolan out of the bar and into the
street Behind him Don and Sammy stand Out of focus they

approach Dolan

EXT 47TH STREET - NIGHT

Hank walks - now a reflection against wet taxi windows and
shiny hoods

He drains the glass then sets it precariously on a taxi
roof A horn blasts A driver SHOUTS It echoes Hank stares
towards the mid town lights

FADE OUT

EXT TENNESSEE WOODS - DAWN

SOUNDS of dogs BARKING Cold ground fog rises from the damp
leafy forest floor

INTO FRAME TWO DOGS Black LABS Excited on a scent They
reach the edge of woods move into a harvested cornfield
Flat barren The SUN crests a distant hill It bathes the
scene in a morning glow A VOICE calls out

JERRY RIVERS (0S)
Yes Zeke whoa Zeke yes boy

One of the dogs stops SITS

Clete Clete No No

Jerry runs hard after him CAMERA FIGHTS IT’S WAY through the
trees picks up Jerry and dogs THEN SWINGS BACK to find Hank
chasing Jerry jumps a small RAVINE and keeps on going
disappearing out of sight

Suddenly the woods are strangely still save the baying of
the hounds After a beat Jerry comes running back

JERRY RIVERS

Jerry approaches the ravine cautiously slowing down and then
he sees Hank LAYING still on the ground Jerry almost afraid
to ask Half jokes

The pain is excruciating

first simple chords of his new song And without even rising
from his chair and with more agonizing emotion than is
imaginable he begins to sing

HANK
“Your cheatin’ heart
will make you weep
You’ll cry and cry
and try to sleep
but sleep won’t come
the whole night through
Your cheatin’ heart

When tears come down
like the fallin’ rain
You’1ll toss around
and call my name
You’1ll walk the floor
the way I do

Your cheatin’ heart
will tell on you”

many difficult things in front of

perform the most difficult task I
have ever done

A SINGLE SPOT hits the solitary microphone

From behind the curtain come the powerful voices of the
WHOLE CAST as they begin SINGING

CAST
“IT wandered so aimless life filled
with sin
I wouldnt let my dear Savior in
Then Jesus came like a stranger in
the night
Praise the Lord I saw the light”

The curtain FOLDS BACK revealing the cast still in shock
washed in pain but singing with all their hearts They
remain at the rear of the stage while the SINGLE LIGHT stays
on the microphone in the front

ON THE CROWD

As this impossible news sinks in Gradually family by
family strangers and friends all begin to stand and as
they come to their feet many sobbing they join in the
singing The auditorium now rings fully with the beauty and
power of Hank’s words

EVERYONE
“Just like a blind man I wandered
alone
Worries and fear I claimed for my
own

Then like the blind man that God
gave back his sight

Praise the Lord I saw the light
I saw the light I saw the light
No more darkness no more night
Now I’m so happy no sorrow in
sight

Praise the Lord I saw the light”
