Based on a true story
FADE IN

INT FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

Mostly shadows illuminated by a lanterns flame But we can
make out the dusty floor the bucket of water with a rag
hanging over the edge

We drift across the room to a bed an ANSTADT RIFLE
standing beside it a FRESH STAR fully carved in its stock

As we move up past the rifle we begin to hear 0S
WHISPERS we keep rising to the SHAPE OF A YOUNG BOY
shivering violently under blankets

and MANS HANDS stroking the boys sweat-soaked hair
trying to comfort him Then the shadowy face of HUGH GLASS
leans into the frame presses against the little boys ear

GLASS
(whispering)
Not yet not yet not yet

DISSOLVE TO

EXT UPPER MISSOURI RIVER1820S - EVENING

As we FLOAT WITH A LEAF DOWN THE CURRENT past a FLATBOAT
BEACHED ON A SANDBAR as DISTANT VOICES seem to rise around
uS

--because beyond the flatboat are TWENTY-FIVE MEN of the
Rocky Mountain Fur Company making camp along the shore
some pitching squares of canvas for makeshift rooftops
others stacking HUNDREDS OF BEAVER PELTS and ANIMAL FURS for
hauling a few Men laughing and singing a circle of
others form a ring around a couple of WRESTLING TRAPPERS
calling out their bets as the Trappers grapple

while nearby several MEN have formed a MAKESHIFT BAND
scratching out a song with fiddles washboards and
harmonicas as a few Trappers dance along passing a bottle
of whiskey among them

This camp is full of life because these are some of the first
men to ever see this untouched wilderness men with a whole
new world just waiting for them to claim their share

And one of the dancing Trappers is JOHN FITZGERALD (30s)
solid and thick a WOLFSKIN CAP flopping on his head as he
locks elbows with another TRAPPER swinging him to the music
The song ends the Trappers CHEER Fitzgerald tosses that
fur cap into the air with several others revealing a STRIP
OF OLD SCALPED SCAR running along one side of his head

And as the caps float back to the earth like snowflakes
CAPTAIN ANDREW HENRY (20s) appears beyond them dressed
in a buckskin jacket with long fringe thick belt pulled
tightly around his waist with two pistols and a knife hanging
from it He stands out among the others like an imposter
pretending to be a member of some exclusive club

HENRY
Fitzgerald you and the rest help
with the fires

The excitement fades from Fitzgeralds eyes replaced with
resentment He watches Henry walk away then grabs his
wolfskin cap from the dirt throws it over his scarred
head and rolls his eyes to MACE BOONE

FITZGERALD
Yes sir Captain

EXT CAMP - EVENING

Fitzgerald and Boone gather a few scraps of wood look over
to Henry pulling off one of his gloves to examine the BLOOD-
FILLED BLISTERS lining his palm

FITZGERALD
Likely got a splinter Can’t
figure what to do without Mama here
to pull it out for him

Boone chuckles spits in Henry’s direction
BOONE
Need a doc Captain
Henry looks up sees Fitzgerald and Boone grinning at him
HENRY

Gather more wood

Fitzgerald waits for Henry to turn then gives his back an
exaggerated salute

FITZGERALD
(under his breath)
Shame my Pap was a broken down
drunk Else he could’ve bought me
a Captain’s job too
Boone snickers Fitzgerald stomps his boot onto a branch
easily snaps it into two easy-to-carry pieces

FITZGERALD (contd)
We got a plan for these fires
Captain or are we roastin’ berries
all the way up to Fort Union

HENRY
Glass and the others will be back
with some game Fitzgerald Just
make sure you have the fires ready

FITZGERALD
My supper’s in the hands of a injun-
lover a peach-fuzz kid and a half-
wit dummy Hell my belly feels
full already

Fitzgerald’s boot CRACKS another branch and when it does
we hear the EXPLOSION OF A GUNSHOT

CUT TO

EXT WILDERNESS - EVENING

And a CLOUD OF SMOKE surrounding the LONG BARREL OF AN
ANSTADT RIFLE

The smoke fades and at the other end of the rifle we see the
worn face of HUGH GLASS one eye still closed as the
other calmly stares down that barrel

VOICE (0S)
Shit fire you got him Mr Glass

Glass lowers the rifle as JIM BRIDGER boyish face
that looks even younger races past with PIG GILMORE (40s)
fat and filthy shuffling right behind

BRIDGER (CONT’D)
Got him square as a barn door

Bridger and Pig trot through the trees to a fallen ELK Glass
walks after them graceful in this world his rifle so
comfortable in his hand it’s like he was born with it there

BRIDGER (contd)
Gonna be a load to haul back to
camp

PIG
Have to split it up I reckon
GLASS
Bridger and me’1l take the tail
Pig you haul the rest

And Fitzgerald was right about Pig being a little slow
because he just nods along pulls out his knife to cut the
tail off for Bridger then stops catches himself
looks up at them grinning back down

PIG
Thats clever Hugh

GLASS
Worth a try anyways

But then Glass notices something his smile fades as he
steps over the elk his eyes locked on the ground beside it
He runs a finger over the dirt touches a broken twig

BRIDGER
‘Nother close by

Glass doesn’t answer studies the track feels the nearby
brush inhales the scent from his hand Bridger and Pig
watch him exchange a confused glance

And then in a flash of movement Glass is racing away

PIG
Hugh

Glass just keeps running Pig and Bridger chase after him

CUT TO
EXT CAMP - EVENING
The men building fires laughing enjoying themselves
Boone on the outskirts gathering branches

CUT TO
GLASS - TEARING THROUGH THE WOODS
-dodging trees leaping over fallen logs loading his

Anstadt as he runs
BRIDGER AND PIG - CHASING AFTER GLASS

--but not as gracefully Bridger trips slams to the
ground scrambles back to his feet to continue on

CUT TO

BOONE - CARRYING AN ARM-LOAD OF WOOD INTO CAMP

seeing other men playing cards He stops along the edge
of camp drops the wood to the ground

BOONE
No rule says I’m the only one
that’s gotta gather this shit

The other men don’t even notice Then an ARROW WHIZZES
THROUGH THE AIR from behind Boone THWACK it hits him in
the back of the neck erupts out the front of his throat

Boone stands frozen confused reaches up and grabs the
bloody arrow finally drops to his knees And that’s when
a TRAPPER looks up sees Boone on his knees holding that
arrow his mouth open like a dying fish

And beyond Boone are THIRTY ARIKARA WARRIORS CHARGING THROUGH
THE TREES FEATHERS RISING FROM THE MOHAWKS SPLITTING THEIR
SHAVED HEADS FACES PAINTED FOR BATTLE

TRAPPER
‘REE

WHOOSH AN ARROW SAILS INTO THE TRAPPER’S CHEST sending
him flying backward The camp explodes into chaos men
YELLING grabbing for weapons stumbling over each other
as they duck behind trees

HENRY - PULLING THE PISTOLS FROM HIS BELT
taking nervous aim at the attacking figures

The Arikara leader (ELK’S TONGUE) animal bones braided into
his mohawk a NECKLACE OF HUMAN EARS around his neck heads
the attackers pouring into camp arrows flying knives
and hatchets swinging

And this is a massacre the Arikara wading through the
trappers stabbing clubbing scalping This once
peaceful world is filled with a sickening mix of war cries
and screams of death

HORSES AND MULES break loose of their ties take off in all
directins

Fitzgerald rises up from behind a log aims his rifle
BOOM takes down one of the warriors He starts reloading
as ANOTHER WARRIOR charges him draws back his knife
Fitzgerald pours the powder but knows he isn’t going to make
it in time The Warrior leaps toward him

--BOOM and it’s like the Warrior hits an invisible
wall flies back to the ground very dead Fitzgerald
spins sees Glass and his Anstadt right behind him

GLASS
GET TO THE BOAT

Fitzgerald takes off but hes a skilled fighter flips
his rifle around swings it like a club across a WARRIORS
head WHACK swings again TAKES OUT ANOTHER WARRIOR
buries his knife into an ATTACKERs belly

GLASS (cont’d)
THE BOAT CAPTAIN

Henry shoves a TRAPPER toward the water An arrow drives
into the Trapper’s leg he goes down Henry lifts him but
several more arrows bury in the man’s back he falls dead

Bridger and Pig join Glass splash into the river SHOOTING
back at the attacking Arikara

A WARRIOR LEAPS FROM THE SHADOWS tackles Bridger to the
shallows pins him underwater raises his hatchet high to
slam down just as Glass dives into him knocking the
Warrior off Bridger Glass and the Warrior wrestle in the
surf until Glass finally overpowers him stabs his knife
deep into the Warrior’s stomach

Bridger kneels in the shallows frozen in shock

GLASS (cont’d)
Go

Pig drags Bridger to his feet they swim toward the boat
ARROWS hiss into the water all around them

Glass pulls his pistol BAM shoots an oncoming
WARRIOR spins after the others joins them as they near
the flatboat

A final TRAPPER charges down the shore after them SEVERAL
WARRIORS pursue him
TRAPPER
WAIT
He aims his pistol over his shoulder as he runs pulls the
trigger CLICK pulls it again CLICK But he’s too
scared to stop his finger CLICK CLICK CLICK

THUD as a hatchet buries in his back He crashes face
first into the shallows

Elks Tongue straddles the dying man grabs the Trapper by
the hair and CUTS OFF HIS LEFT EAR then holds it up to
Glass and the others as he SCREAMS HIS WAR CRY

Glass and the men shove the flatboat off the sandbar Arrows
dart past them drive into the wooden boat They scramble
aboard as the current carries them away

Pig reaches over the side pulls the frantic WILLIAM ANDERSON
up onto the boat Fitzgerald and Glass grab LONGPOLES
shove them against the river’s bottom to pick up speed

Henry stands on deck watching as Elk’s Tongue yanks a DYING
TRAPPER’s head back by his hair to peel away his scalp
Henry drops his eyes can’t watch The TRAPPER’S SCREAM
ECHOES OVER HIM

EXT MISSOURI RIVERFLATBOAT - LATER

Quiet and dark the battle long over The flatboat floats
with the gentle current The NINE SURVIVING TRAPPERS are
scattered around the deck Glass digging an arrow out of
MURPHY’s shoulder Fitzgerald poling on one side with
Anderson on the other STUBBY BILL and Pig standing patrol
with their rifles Bridger doctoring a badly WOUNDED
TRAPPER and Henry standing at the front of the flatboat
staring off blankly

FITZGERALD
What’s the plan Captain

Henry’s still lost in those screams

FITZGERALD (contd)
Captain What the hell do we do
now

Henry snaps out of his stare turns to the men obviously
doesn’t have an answer

ANDERSON
We’re just floatin’ farther from
Fort Union
Henry’s eyes instinctively look to Glass

GLASS
The Missouri’s no good Not if the
‘Ree’s running it

FITZGERALD
So we just float the hell down to
Mexico or wherever else this
current takes us

GLASS
We get safe outta range then track
another course up on land

FITZGERALD
Add weeks to the trip

BRIDGER
Better that than endin’ up scalped
on the side of the river

FITZGERALD

Shut up boy you don’t get no say
in this

(back to Henry)
And in case you hadn’t noticed
Captain we’re seventeen men short
of what we were

(off the wounded trapper)
Eighteen before long

HENRY
I understand our situation Mr
Fitzgerald We do like Glass
said put some distance between
us and the Arikara then chart a
course to Fort Union

FITZGERALD
Like Glass says Shit now were
trustin him to stay alive

PIG
He’s the company scout

FITZGERALD
Scouted us right into a pack a
Ree Maybe his years livin with
the Pawnee makes him forget what
side hes on
PIG
Looked to be on your side when he
saved your hide back there

Fitzgerald throws a deadly glare at Pig

FITZGERALD
I didnt need savin by Glass or
nobody else We clear on that you
simple sonofabitch

Pig tries to hold Fitzgeralds glare cant looks back
to the passing shores shoots a quick glance to Glass who
gives him a nod Thank you And thats enough to make Pig
smile proud of himself

EXT WILDERNESS - NIGHT

A small campfire glows in the night A DOZEN FRENCH TRAPPERS
are scattered around the camp talking laughing

--enough that they dont notice the shadows silently
approaching from the trees around them

-Elks Tongue and several of his Arikara warriors

Finally one of the Trappers spots Elks Tongue freezes in
mid-sentence as the others turn to his stare

But this is no attack this is a business transaction
Elks Tongue tosses a STACK OF SCALPS at their feet the
scalps we saw them take from Glass company earlier

TOUSSAINT (40s) the leader of this bunch forces a nervous
smile throws a glance to his rifle well out of reach

TOUSSAINT
(all his dialogue is
spoken in French)
You had a good hunt
(off the scalps)
These are all English Americans

Elks Tongue just stares back doesnt understand

TOUSSAINT (contd)
No French here

Toussaint taps his own chest points to the other trappers

TOUSSAINT (contd)
No French We dont pay for French

Elks Tongue shakes his head says something in Arikara
that Toussaint and the rest of us dont understand not
until he holds out his hand

TOUSSAINT (cont’d)
(to a TRAPPER)
Pay the savage
(to Elks Tongue)
You want to eat You want food

Toussaint pantomimes eating Elks Tongue shakes his head

The Trapper digs out some coins blankets liquor
gives them to Elks Tongues Warriors

TOUSSAINT (contd)
Only kill English and American
This land is for you and us We
work together

Elks Tongue points to one of the Frenchmens HORSES tied in
the trees

TOUSSAINT (contd)
(shaking his head)
No horses We need them

Elks Tongue points again

TOUSSAINT (contd)
I told you last time They arent
part of the trade

One of Elks Tongues Warriors moves to the horse begins
stroking it checking its teeth like a new owner

TOUSSAINT (contd)
Tell your man no horse

But Elks Tongue isnt telling his man anything

TOUSSAINT (contd)
(to a Trapper)
Get him away I dont want that
animals stink on my pony

As the Trapper moves toward the Warrior

ELKS TONGUE
(in broken French)
Its your smell that covers our
land

and everyone freezes because Toussaint and his Men are
shocked by Elks Tongues use of their language And Elks
Tongue suddenly seems smarter more dangerous especially

with the way hes looking at Toussaint right now
ELKS TONGUE (contd)
(still in French)
We take your horses

And Toussaints pretty smart too smart enough to see this
deal has turned bad fast and that he and his Men dont
stand a chance against Elks Tongues Warriors

So Toussaint forces a thin smile motions his Trapper back

TOUSSAINT
Business is business

The French can only sit there and watch as Elks Tongues
gang disappears into the night with their horses

EXT MISSOURI RIVERFLATBOAT - NIGHT

ANGLE ON THE BADLY WOUNDED TRAPPER NOW DEAD

as hands push the body over the side of the boat It
splashes into the water floats downstream

We PULL BACK see that the flatboat is beached along the
bank of the river Glass Bridger and Pig watch the body
drift away

PIG
Reckon its better than lettin the
Ree find him take his ears
Glass nods turns away
BRIDGER
Thank you for what you done back
there
GLASS
Youd have done the same for me
BRIDGER
(nods hopeful)

Yessir

Glass Bridger and Pig approach the others all gathered
around Henrys map spread out on the ground

HENRY
Tryin to set a course

Glass runs his finger along a THIN BLUE LINE
GLASS

Best course is to hike west to the
Grand then follow it up to Fort

Union

FITZGERALD
On foot It’ll be winter before we
get there

ANDERSON

Unless we come across a post
trade for some horses

GLASS
No posts that far over

FITZGERALD
So if we do this we do every step
on our own feet

Henry considers this a beat then

HENRY
Then that’s what we’ll have to do

More GRUMBLING from Fitzgerald and Anderson as they start
gathering whats left of the supplies for the journey

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Shadowy figures moving through the trees not a word
spoken And then we see Glass leading the group eyes
cutting into the dark searching for any danger

Pigs off to one side of Glass Henry the other with
Fitzgerald leading the rest right behind And theyre all
exhausted only the fear of what else might be hidden in
these trees is keeping them awake

EXT WOODSSTREAM - LATER
Slivers of moonlight bleed through the canopy of trees
shine over Anderson Stubby Bill and Murphy as they crouch

beside the stream filling their canteens

Henry and Pig are studying that map Bridger stands in the
shadows keeping watch

Glass sits at the base of a tree cleaning his Anstadt
rifle polishing down the TATTERED STAR CARVED INTO THE
STOCK

Fitzgerald takes a gulp from his FLASK watches Glass with
mean drunk eyes

FITZGERALD
You treat that Anstadt sweeter than
any woman Glass

STUBBY BILL
Thats cause there aint no woman
that can stop a ‘Ree from three
hundred feet

ANDERSON
I knew a particular big-breasted
redhead in Boston that might come
close

The others manage a nervous laugh Glass doesnt react
just keeps working on the Anstadt Fitzgerald walks to
Glass reaches down and grabs the barrel of the Anstadt

FITZGERALD
Lemme see whats so special bout
that shooter a yours

Glass holds firm

GLASS
Workin’ on it

FITZGERALD
Well you can stop workin on it
and lemme have a look like I said

Fitzgerald gives another tug but Glass’ grip only grows
tighter His eyes roll up to Fitzgerald make it clear he
isn’t giving up his rifle And they hold that stare just as
hard as they’re holding Glass’ gun

FITZGERALD (contd)
You got hired into this outfit so
you work for us Or did you forget
your place

GLASS
Best I can tell my place is right
where I want it on the smart end

of this rifle

Fitzgerald realizes the barrel he’s holding is aimed his
direction while Glass’ hand seems suddenly very close to the
trigger But Fitzgerald’s pride won’t let him lose this tug
of war Which means this thing’s about to turn real ugly

FITZGERALD
Any of you boys wonder how it is
them Ree got the drop on us
when Glass here was supposed to be
lookin out for just that

HENRY
Thats enough Fitzgerald We need
to keep movin

FITZGERALD
(to Glass)
Makes me think maybe youre gettin
a cut on all them scalps they sell
to the Frenchies

Fitzgerald uses his free hand to pull off that fur cap of
his shows off his wide hairless scar

FITZGERALD (contd)
How much did you get for this Or
for my wifes

And that flask of whiskey has just helped give us a glimpse
into where some of Fitzgeralds rage comes from

HENRY
Goddammit Fitzgerald I said
that’s enough

Fitzgerald keeps his grip on the rifle another moment then
shoves the Anstadt barrel back at Glass

FITZGERALD
To me you aint no whiter than them
Ree

Fitzgerald spits to the ground a few feet away from Glass
Glass isnt biting goes back to his rifle So Fitzgerald
walks back to the others spots Bridger looking at him

FITZGERALD (contd)
Whatta you starin at boy

Bridger drops his eyes locks them on the ground until hes
sure Fitzgerald has lost interest Then he glances back
up sees Glass watching him just for a moment before he

goes back to the Anstadt

EXT WOODS - LATER

The group pushing through the darkness dried leaves
crunching under their boots

Glass and Henry are out front Henry throws a glance back to
Fitzgerald bringing up the rear with Anderson

HENRY

Fitzgeralds just testing you
Same with me since we left St
Louis Not sure Ive passed many
so far Especially todays

(beat)
Maybe I should’ve had us make camp
further up river

GLASS
The tracks I saw those ‘Ree had
been on us for a while They’d have
gone as far north as it took

Henry nods hopes that’s true
GLASS (cont’d)
Youre a good man Captain Soon
as you realize that these others
will too
Henry likes hearing that still isn’t sure it’s true
HENRY
Its a different world than Boston
But my father he thought this
would be good for me

Henry thinks about that a beat then shakes away the memory

HENRY (contd)
Where are you from originally

GLASS
Pennsylvania

HENRY
Long way from home

A BEAT then
GLASS
Stopped bein a home for me a while

back

Henry can sense he shouldnt dig deeper

HENRY
So you ended up out here with the
Pawnee

GLASS

Not by choice They grabbed me
while I was trappin the Arkansas
I figured it was to kill me but
turned out they were just curious
Nothin savage about ‘em I ended
up stayin with em a year or so
Till the Ree took their land
pushed ‘em north

HENRY
And youve just wandered alone
since

GLASS

Havent found a place I belong
Another quiet beat then

HENRY
How much experience have you had
with the Arikara

GLASS
Enough to know to stay outta their
way And that once theyve got
your scent theyre not easy to
shake loose

HENRY
And our chances of makin it up to
Fort Union

GLASS
A smart man would always put his
chips on the Ree

Thats not the answer Henry wanted to hear He peers into
the darkness ahead
EXT WILDERNESS - MORNING

The sun is just rising up over the horizon

EXT WILDERNESS - DAY

Thick with trees Henry leads the men single file through
the woods

STUBBY BILL
Shouldn’t we have hit the Grand by
now

HENRY
We’ll reach it soon enough Glass
said to keep this course

FITZGERALD
Its always Glass said So why is
it I don’t see him ‘round nowheres
then

PIG
On account he’s up ahead makin’
sure it’s clear and you get to
keep your ears

Fitzgerald throws Pig an angry glance

FITZGERALD
Or he’s run off left us to find
our own way

BRIDGER
Mr Glass wouldn’t do that

FITZGERALD
You aint got no idea know what
your savage-lovin Mr Glass might
do And thats the problem

EXT WOODS - DAY

Glass moves slowly through the brush almost gliding
subtle twists and turns to avoid branches and leaves
careful not to leave his scent behind And his eyes cut
through the trees as he moves digging for any sign of
movement

He spots something at his feet crouches down running his
finger over the SMALL ANIMAL TRACK in the dirt

OS RUSTLING snaps his head up to the TREMBLING OF
BUSHES growing harder whatever’s in there is coming
toward Glass He calmly raises his rifle presses the
stock firmly against his shoulder closes one eye as he
takes steady aim down the long barrel

to the shapes rumbling out of the brush TWO BEAR CUBS
playfully wrestling

Glass lowers the Anstadt looks past the cubs for something

else but the woods are empty A SUDDEN FEAR FILLS GLASS’
EYES
-he spins right into the GIANT GRIZZLY SWINGING ITS PAW

AT HIM hitting him across the side of the neck The
animal’s razor claws tear into Glass’ throat as the force
sends him flying through the air

Glass sails into a thick tree the CRACK OF HIS LEG
SNAPPING against the trunk The rifle falls from his hand
The Grizzly lets out a massive ROAR charges Glass Glass
crawls to the Anstadt grabs it has just enough time to
tilt the rifle toward the bear BOOM

-hits the bear slowing the animal but not enough to
stop its attack

CUT TO
HENRY - HEARING THE BLAST
HENRY
UP AHEAD
Henry takes off at full sprint The other men follow
CUT TO

GLASS - AS THE BEAR LEAPS ON TOP OF HIM

tosses Glass aside with a powerful swing Glass hits the
ground with a PAINFUL THUD He starts CRAWLING AWAY pulling
the KNIFE from his belt as the bear rises up like a giant
behind him swings tears its claws across Glass’s back
shredding deep into his flesh

Glass is fighting for his life now flailing with the
knife slicing it across the bear’s paw as it whips past
him The wound slows the bear enough for Glass to start
crawling again

But the Grizzly doesn’t give Glass the chance ROARS is
on him in a flash a BLUR OF CLAWS AND FANGS tearing
across Glass’ chest

Glass drives his knife into the bear again deep trying
to tear through the layers of flesh to something more vital

CUT TO

HENRY - LEADING THE CHARGE THROUGH THE FOREST

CUT TO

GLASS AND THE GRIZZLY - FIGHTING THIS EPIC BATTLE

-locked in a death grip tumbling along the ground

trading violent blows Glass’ blade versus the Grizzly’s
claws and fangs snapping small trees as they roll over

them toward the edge of a steep embankment

- and ROLL DOWN spinning over and over each ROARING
AT THE OTHER Glass pounding the knife into the bear again
and again as they fall neither willing to surrender as
they careen down the slope at a dizzying pace then SLAM TO
THE BOTTOM WITH A CRUNCH

The forest falls still Glass hidden somewhere beneath the
massive animal both deathly motionless

EXT WOODS - DAY

Bridger’s the first to reach the battleground sees the TWO
FRIGHTENED BEAR CUBS SCURRY AWAY He follows the bloody
ground and crushed underbrush to the top of the slope
looks down to the mass of flesh at the bottom

BRIDGER
Christ Almighty

Henry Pig and the others reach the edge

HENRY
Glass

No answer And all they can see is the bear so they scan
the trees

PIG
HUGH

Still nothing So Bridger takes off down the slope losing
his balance but rolling back to his feet He reaches the
bear sees GLASS’ MANGLED ARM STICKING OUT FROM BENEATH IT

BRIDGER
He’s down here

Bridger uses all his strength to push the bear off as the
other men scramble down But Bridger can’t budge the massive
carcass not until Stubby Bill and Pig join in shove the
animal over revealing the bloody mass that is Hugh Glass

-his throat is torn wide open stomach and chest a
gruesome design of gashes and cuts His right leg is twisted
in a horrible angle

Bridger’s legs give out he drops to a knee and vomits

MURPHY
Oh Jesus

STUBBY BILL
He’s tore to pieces

The men stare down at Glass’ corpse

ANDERSON
Least he took that Grizz down with
him

FITZGERALD

Wished he’da done it without firing
his rifle If there wasn’t no ‘Ree
around before there will be now

And that’s all Pig can stand he TACKLES FITZGERALD they
roll to the ground And in a flash Fitzgerald is on top
raining punches down on Pig turning his face into a bloody
mess Henry and Anderson grab Fitzgerald drag him off

HENRY
THAT’S ENOUGH

Then somehow GLASS GASPS this horrible GUTTURAL MOAN

STUBBY BILL
Holy Christ

Henry and Bridger fall to their knees beside Glass Glass
looks up at the men tries to focus through the blood and
pain His breathing is just a GURGLING WHEEZE bubbles
forming along the deep gashes in his throat with each gasp

HENRY
Get me some water

Stubby Bill tosses Henry his canteen Henry empties it over
Glass’ throat his chest The water hits the wounds and
immediately transforms to blood

BRIDGER
Oh Jesus Jesus

Glass lifts a trembling hand to his throat feels the
gaping wound His eyes widen in horror He COUGHS the
air splashes blood up from the open wounds

HENRY
It’s okay Hugh
(pushing Glass’ hand away)
You’re going to be fine

Henry spins his head away from Glass

HENRY (contd)
(whispers )
I need some rags before he bleeds
out

Pig whips a shirt from his bag shreds it

HENRY (contd)
And your whiskey

Pig tosses a bottle to Henry Henry pours it over the
gashes The BURNING PAIN arches Glass he CRIES OUT in
that same HORRIFIC MOAN

HENRY (contd)
Hold him down Bridger goddammit

Bridger throws his weight against Glass’ shoulders

HENRY (contd)
The rest of you spread out scout
a circle around us Fitzgerald you
and Anderson take west and north
Murphy and Bill south and east
Watch for anyone that might’ve
heard that shot

And for the first time Henry seems like a leader of men
firm in complete control just as Glass said he would
be So the men hurry off to their positions

PIG
What about me Cap

HENRY
Get down here and help me tie off
these wounds best we can

Pig shakily joins Henry in wrapping the wounds The blood
keeps seeping out soaking the rags

PIG
It won’t stop bleedin’

HENRY
Shut up Pig
(to Glass)

Were fixing you up Hugh

Glass is like a shredded rag doll dazed eyes staring up at
them as they work on his wounds wrap the rags around his
throat across his chest and stomach

Bridger stares down at Glass with tears in his eyes

BRIDGER
I’m sorry Mr Glass I’m sorry

Henry glances down to the PUDDLE OF BLOOD spilling out over
his knees oozing out from beneath Glass

HENRY
Roll him over easy

They gently push Glass onto one side revealing DEEP JAGGED
GASHES running across the width of Glass’ back Henry stares
at the open flesh ready to panic again but he doesn’t
Instead he looks to Pig

HENRY (contd)
Get me the kit We need to stitch
his back up

BRIDGER
What about the rest

HENRY
He’s losing more blood back here
(off the throat)
And I don’t know what to do with
that yet

Pig digs out a thick needle and spool of black thread
hands it to Henry Henry grabs the whiskey bottle

HENRY (contd)
I’m sorry for how this is about to
burn Hugh

Henry pours the whiskey over Glass’ back And the pain must
be excruciating because Glass lets out a HORRIBLE WAIL

CUT TO

EXT WOODS - CONTINUOUS

Fitzgerald and Anderson standing watch together in the trees
Glass’ scream erupts through the trees and they both
immediately crouch down to a knee out of sight to anyone
out there that might have heard that

ANDERSON
They’re torturin’ the bastard

FITZGERALD
And riskin’ gettin’ the rest of us
killed in the process Proper thing
would be to end it for him quick

ANDERSON
‘Less he could pull through

FITZGERALD
You seen what that grizz did to
him Glass’ll be dead inside a
hour We all will be if he keeps
screamin’ like that

EXT WOODS - LATER

SERIES OF SHOTS

HENRY BRIDGER AND PIG WORKING OVER GLASS Bridger and Pig
pressing the skin on Glass’ back together as Henry sutures
the wound

HENRY CLEANING GLASS’ SHREDDED THROAT

BRIDGER AND PIG HOLDING GLASS DOWN AS HENRY SNAPS GLASS’ LEG
BACK IN PLACE the pain is too much Glass passes out

FITZGERALD PEERING BACK THROUGH THE TREES to Henry
doctoring Glass Fitzgerald shakes his head in anger
turns back to the darkening forest

EXT WOODS - EVENING

Glass rests unconscious on the ground Two branches act as a
splint on his leg A blanket covers his body the stitches
stretch to hold his throat together

Henry crouches a short distance away from him rinsing his
hands under a canteen Bridger and Pig stand beside him

BRIDGER
What now

HENRY
We wait
(to Pig)
Go tell the others were making
camp here for the night

Pig nods hustles off Henry glances back to Glass

HENRY (contd)
Does he have any kin you know of

BRIDGER
Never mentioned none

Henry looks beyond Glass to the bear sprawled on the
ground its claws and fangs soaked with Glass blood

HENRY
Have the men gather wood but make
sure it’s dry We don’t want much
smoke when we cook that grizzly

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

And what’s left of the grizzly its fur cut away slabs
of flesh butchered from its skeleton

A fire burns at the center of camp a chunk of meat roasts

above the flame The men sit around the fire Murphy
reaches up tears a strip of meat from the roast tossing
it in his mouth The men are silent the pall of Glass’

attack still hanging over them

Bridger rises walks to the Grizzly crouches down over
it grabbing the animal’s enormous paw It dwarfs his own

hand as he examines the massive claws Bridger pulls out

his knife stretches the claws out to their full length

and CUTS THEM OFF AT ITS BASE

FITZGERALD (0S)
What makes you think you earned a
claw boy

Bridger turns with a start ONE OF THE CLAWS FALLS TO THE
DIRT Bridger sees Fitzgerald standing over him meat in his
hand his lips shiny with the grease

FITZGERALD (contd)
You didn’t take that grizz down

BRIDGER
It ain’t for me

Bridger carries another claw around Fitzgerald to the
sleeping Glass Pig’s already crouched beside him Bridger
lifts Glass’ small leather POSSIBLES BAG from beside the
Anstadt rifle drops the claw inside throws a look back
to Fitzgerald

Pig holds his palm out just above Glass’ mouth

PIG
I can feel some air outta his
mouth Maybe Captain sealed up his
throat proper huh
(off Bridger’s silence)
Whatta you figure his odds are
Jim

Bridger stares down at what’s left of Glass
BRIDGER
Long
EXT CAMP - NIGHT

The fire has burned down to nothing The men sleep scattered
about Murphy keeps watch just outside of camp

Glass lies there awake eyes wide open a living corpse
And his breathing is just as labored as before raspy
blood-soaked strains
Fitzgerald tosses and turns listening to Glass’ gurgling
FITZGERALD

You ain’t doin’ him or us no

favors Captain lettin’ him suffer

that way
Henry’s awake but doesn’t answer He’s holding his pistol
in his hand as he stares at Glass thinking the same thing
Fitzgerald just said But he doesn’t move not yet

Bridger sits beyond him attaching the BEAR CLAW TO A THIN
LEATHER STRAP a future necklace

EXT CAMP - MORNING

ANGLE ON GLASS

-awake staring upward shivering beads of sweat
covering his face those same weak breaths

CUT TO

GLASS POV

-on the morning sky the sun pouring in through the
treetops until a SMALL FIGURE steps into the bright
sunlight stands over Glass and all we can make out is the
silhouette

GLASS

-blinks tries to focus on the figure

GLASS POV

on the silhouette as it begins to clear the FACE OF
A YOUNG BOY staring down scared
BOY
Shes sick again Pa
And then we see Glass the Glass of years ago looking up
from beneath a broken wagon axle He raises up sees a

farmhouse sitting alone in the middle of a beautiful wide
open Pennsylvania valley

BOY (contd)
Sounds worse this time

Glass stands strides toward the house

INT FARMHOUSE - DAY

Glass WIFE is on her hands and knees in the corner of the
room COUGHING hard like its taking every ounce of
strength she has

The door opens and a square of sunlight pours in over her
then Glass shadow as he enters moves to her kneels
down touches her head and she knocks his hand away

WIFE
No Keep back Hugh please

Glass hesitates a moment then strokes her hair again His
wife turns and we see her face deathly pale a trickle
of blood on her lips shes dying

Glass pulls her against him holds her close squints
back into the doorway of sunlight the small shape moving
closer growing larger leaning down reaching toward

him and BECOMING PIG

PIG
Lookin better Hugh

And then we realize were back in camp with Glass barely
hanging onto life staring up at Henry crouching beside
Glass squeezing Glass hand

PIG (contd)
Gonna be fine

Then we see Bridger kneel on the other side of Glass press
a WET RAG to Glass head Henry stands beside him

Fitzgerald Anderson Murphy and Stubby Bill sit huddled a
few yards away watching

ANDERSON
Fever’s hit Won’t be long now

FITZGERALD
I seen a bad one drag on days

ANGLE ON GLASS
-eyes still open he can hear every word
FITZGERALD (0S) (cont’d)
Insides shut down flesh starts

to spoil and turn Ain’t no way for-

HENRY (0S)
Quiet Fitzgerald

FITZGERALD
--points a stick at Glass
FITZGERALD
(to Henry)
We keep sittin’ here watchin’ him
die only gives the ‘Ree more
chance to run up on us
Henry doesn’t answer just keeps staring down at Glass
BRIDGER
He’s burnin’ Cap Water turns to

boil as soon as it touches him

Henry considers this then

HENRY
Pig take Anderson and scout ahead
Grand should be just west of here
Find us the best route

Pig nods grabs his gear He and Anderson take off Henry
turns walks over to Fitzgerald and Stubby Bill

HENRY (contd)
(whispers )
You two can start digging a grave

Fitzgerald tosses the stick away

FITZGERALD
Least it’s a step in the right
direction

EXT CAMP - LATER

Fitzgerald is covered in dirt and sweat standing knee deep
in Glass’ grave Stubby Bill stands over him

FITZGERALD
Any coyote digs that deep deserves
the meal

He takes Stubby Bill’s hand pulls himself out spots Pig
and Anderson walking back into camp

ANDERSON
Found it Cap

PIG
No more than a mile or so out
(for Fitzgerald to hear)
Right where Glass had us headed

Henry looks to Bridger still doctoring Glass

HENRY
We could build a litter Haul him
with us

ANDERSON

Its rocky and steep goin
Henry looks to Pig for an honest answer
PIG

Marshy on the other side We could
try it but

FITZGERALD
I signed on as a trapper not a
goddamn mule

BRIDGER
(to Henry)
Shape he’s in I don’t see no way

he’d make bein’ drug

Henry nods his mind racing for a solution He turns
squints out ahead of them their trail home He stares at
it a long beat then lowers his hand back to that pistol
pulls it from his belt and turns to Glass

HENRY
Lay that rag over his eyes Mr
Bridger
The other men all drop their heads except for

Fitzgerald he’s ready to see this end

BRIDGER
But Captain

HENRY
Do it

PIG
Lets hang on a minute Cap

HENRY
(to Bridger)
Now

Bridger doesnt want to but follows orders reaches to
fold the wet rag down over Glass’ wide open eyes And Glass
must know what’s happening because his eyes roll up to
Bridger’s then to the Anstadt resting beside him His
lips try to form a word his fingers dig into the dirt
beside him clawing toward that Anstadt

toward that stock with the old carved star

PIG
He wants his rifle

Henry hesitates a beat then nods Bridger grabs the
Anstadt rests it in Glass hand

PIG (contd)
(tears in his eyes)
Here ya are Hugh

ANGLE ON GLASS HAND

feeling its way down to the stock pressing his palm
against that worn star carving
Bridger just watches him then reaches back out to the rag

CUT TO

GLASS’ POV - ON BRIDGER

the boy looking away as he pulls the rag over our eyes
everything goes black

HENRY (0S)
Step clear Mr Bridger

A LONG AGONIZING BEAT in the dark waiting for that gunshot
then

BACK TO SCENE

Henry standing over Glass pistol aimed down His hand
trembles slightly

Pig turns away presses his hands over his ears
Bridger takes a few steps back stares at Henry

Henry struggles to steady his aim until finally it calms
because he’s thought of something else His arm drops to his
side

HENRY (contd)
There’s a seventy dollar bonus from
the Rocky Mountain Fur Company to
the two men that stay with Glass
see this through

BRIDGER
I’1l stay with him money or not

PIG
Same here

Fitzgerald snorts a stifled laugh Bridger shoots him a
look but even Henry knows Fitzgerald is right Bridger and
Pig would never survive this alone

HENRY
Is there a third

Henry looks to the others they all drop their eyes not
interested

FITZGERALD
Three won’t stand much chance
against a party of ‘Ree Captain
And seventy dollars won’t buy me a
new setta ears

HENRY
A hundred then

Still nothing from the others

BRIDGER
They can have my share too

FITZGERALD
If Pig feels the same Ill lag
back with em I don’t mind
fallin’ a day or so behind for
three hundred dollars

Pig looks to Bridger who nods so Pig nods too
HENRY
But Glass is to be cared for until
Understood
FITZGERALD

(nods to Bridger)
I’1ll let the young doctor do his
job

Henry hesitates doesn’t like this but knows it’s the best
option left

HENRY
The rest gather your gear
Bridger reaches down lifts the rag from Glass’ face
Their eyes meet Bridger gives Glass a nod

EXT CAMP - LATER

Henry and the others are loaded and ready to leave Henry
pulls Bridger aside

HENRY
As long as necessary And a proper
burial when its time He’s earned
that

Bridger nods Henry turns leads the men into the trees
toward the Grand toward Fort Union

EXT CAMP - DUSK
Bridger and Pig crouch beside Glass changing his bandages

Fitzgerald steps in lifts Glass Anstadt from beside
Glass

FITZGERALD
Ill take first watch

PIG
You shouldnt use that

FITZGERALD
Trust me Dummy he ain’t gonna be
needin’ it tonight

Glass is helpless to move can only watch Fitzgerald
disappear into the trees

Glass eyes drift back the glowing embers the light
blurs

becomes the FAINT FLICKER OF A GLOWING LANTERN resting
in a dusty window Outside the window theres a fresh
grave we might even be able to make out the name Elizabeth
Glass on the wooden headstone as we move closer to the
window through that twitching flame

-and see TWO DARK SHAPES inside the larger figure
sitting beside a bed the smaller one lying in it Its
Glass and the Boy

INT HOUSE - NIGHT

TIGHT ON A RIFLE GLASS ANSTADT resting across the
Boys lap as Glass hands carve a STAR into the fresh stock
with a knife The lantern flame shimmers over them

The Boys hands join in small and frail as they brush the
wood chips away

BOY (0S)
(tired weak)
I like the star

GLASS (0S)
So everybody1ll know its yours

Glass hand digs away more of the design Some 0S COUGHING
from the Boy The small hand runs over the carving almost
caressing it Then it flinches in pain

GLASS (0S) (contd)
Careful

A BEAD OF BLOOD forms on the little boys nicked finger
drops down onto the rifle runs along the newly carved
design before it’s finally ABSORBED INTO THE FRESH WOOD

The two pair of hands continue working on the rifle together

BOY (0S)
When can I try it out

GLASS (0S)
Soon as you feel up to it

A long quiet beat just the scrape of the blade against
wood the small hands mimicking the movement of the large
ones Then
BOY (0S)
Will you look after it for me till
then

Glass hands stop carving maybe even tremble just a
bit And before he can answer

PIG (V0)
Youre cheatin Jim

CUT TO

EXT CAMP - DAY

Glass lying on the ground his eyes open that same
labored breathing as he looks across camp

Glass thinking all just killing time waiting for
Glass to die

EXT WILDERNESS - DAY

Pig somewhere in the woods setting up a small snare trap

EXT CAMP - DAY

Bridger and Pig kneel on each side of Glass easing some
broth into his mouth cleaning his wounds

Pig throws a nervous glance to Bridger who shakes his
head dont listen to him
EXT WILDERNESS - DAY
Anderson stands on a ridge scouting a course He waves back
to Henry and the others They follow after him Behind
them a THIN LINE OF SMOKE rises from the trees
EXT CLEARING - DAY

A DEAD PACK MULE engulfed in flames A SCALPED TRAPPER lies
in the dirt beside it Hes missing his LEFT EAR

Beyond the Trapper several Arikara Warriors dig through

canvas sacks pulling out supplies Elks Tongue stands over

EXT WILDERNESS - EVENING

From high above the sun is sinking over the trees

EXT WOODSRIVER - EVENING

Bridger walks toward the rushing water carrying empty
canteens

EXT WOODS - EVENING

Pig pulls a dead raccoon from his snare trap

EXT CAMP - EVENING

Fitzgerald sits bored against a tree eyes locked on Glass as
he twists a knife in his hands flipping it point first
into the dirt grabbing repeating

FITZGERALD
When are you gonna die Glass

-twist flip thwack and never pulling his eyes off
Glass

FITZGERALD (contd)
Like you shoulda done days ago

Fitzgerald sits in silence as if he’s waiting for an answer
Finally he snaps the knife from the dirt stands and walks
over to Glass crouches down studies Glass red

Fitzgerald holding that knife tip against Glass’ throat
Glass just staring up at him helpless
FITZGERALD
Be easier on us all if you’d take
that last breath
The two men hold a stare that knife just floating above
Glass skin until Fitzgerald finally pulls it back
grabs a bloodstained rag from beside them wads it up

FITZGERALD (contd)
I could help ya with that if you’d
like Muzzle ya right now end

Nobody’d ever know you give up

Fitzgerald moves the rag over Glass’ nose and mouth holds
it there just inches above
FITZGERALD (contd)
You just gimme a blink if you want
me to do it

Glass locks his eyes on Fitzgerald’s both men unblinking

A DROP OF BLOOD hangs from the rag finally falls lands
on Glass’ lips

Fitzgerald almost smiles waiting for the inevitable as
Glass stares back fighting the urge to blink but theres
no chance he wins this battle And he finally does
-and Fitzgeralds eyes roll up to make sure theyre alone

Then he STUFFS THAT BLOODY RAG INTO GLASS MOUTH

Glass struggles against it but he can barely move this is
going to end quickly

FITZGERALD (contd)
Easy now

And Fitzgerald is emotionless about this killing almost
like hes putting down a piece of livestock

-as Glass struggles weaken slow its almost over

until THWACK the butt of a rifle smacks Fitzgerald
across the head knocks him to the dirt dazed

-as Pig drops down beside Glass tries to hold his rifle
on Fitzgerald as he tugs that rag out helps Glass

PIG

Fitzgerald moves toward them

PIG

But Pig barely has his rifle aimed before FITZGERALD FLINGS
HIS KNIFE INTO PIG’S CHEST He freezes stunned the
rifle slips from his hands

FITZGERALD
I told ya to shut up

And Fitzgerald is on Pig in a flash pulling that knife
out

FITZGERALD (contd)
But you stupid sonofabitch wouldnt

Glass struggles to reach for Pig to stop Fitzgerald from
murdering his friend but whats left of his body barely
moves

CUT TO

GLASS POV

on Fitzgerald with the knife in his blood-soaked hands
finishing Pig off

FITZGERALD looks around for Bridger eye contact with
Glass his mind racing

He grabs Pigs arms drags him out of the camp hides his
body in the brush hurries back in slings Pigs rifle

and that dead raccoon deep into the trees kicks dirt over
the spilled blood on the ground

-goes back to Pig’s body kneels down over him With the
knife he cuts off Pig’s ears and a piece of scalp then
hides them in a small hole covers it with dead leaves

Then sets his eyes back on Glass the only witness
staring back So Fitzgerald starts for him

BRIDGER (0S)
Breathin changed

Fitzgerald spins sees Bridger entering camp dropping
the canteens He hesitates a beat then shakes his head

FITZGERALD
Hadnt noticed

Bridger moves over to Glass kneels down and Glass grips
Bridgers arm tries to speak can barely open his mouth

BRIDGER
Easy Mr Glass Hes hot as fire

Bridger pours some water over a rag rests it across Glass
head

BRIDGER (contd)
Thisll help
(to Fitzgerald)
Where’s Pig

FITZGERALD
Figured he’d joined up with you

Bridger shakes his head scans the forest

Fitzgerald just slides back down against that tree starts
shaving a stick with that knife that just gutted Pig He
watches Glass and Bridger deciding his next move

EXT CAMP - DUSK

Glass awake watching Fitzgerald poke at the small fire
with a branch Bridger stands at the edge of camp squinting
out into the darkness

BRIDGER
Pig

FITZGERALD
Quiet kid goddammit Bring the
whole Ree tribe on us

BRIDGER
He shoulda been in by now
FITZGERALD
Dummy dont know front from back
half the time You shouldnta let

him wander out alone

BRIDGER
He was just checkin’ his snares

Bridger walks deeper into the trees just past that brush
where Fitzgerald hid Pigs body

Fitzgerald watches regrips that branch and we notice
its been shaved to a JAGGED POINT

But Bridger just turns back

BRIDGER (contd)
Did you go out to look for him

FITZGERALD
(off Glass)
Already got my hands full nurse-
maidin’ one No time for another
Bridger scans the forest again then slides down to the
ground next to Glass rocks back and forth nervous for
his friend

Fitzgeralds eyes drift to Glass the men hold a look

EXT WILDERNESS - NIGHT
From high above the trees The world is silent peaceful

CUT TO

BLACK
--the sound of FRENZIED BREATHING
FITZGERALD (VO)
(panicked whisper)

Bridger Get your ass up

Dim light fills the frame then we see FITZGERALD’S FACE
right in front of us

FITZGERALD (CONT’D)
‘Ree
BRIDGER - SCRAMBLES UP FROM THE TREE HE WAS LEANING

wipes the sleep from his eyes

Fitzgerald gathers his bag starts throwing in food and
Bridger is scared out of his mind does the

supplies

BRIDGER

FITZGERALD
Keep quiet There’s twenty of ‘em
at least Down at the creak but
comin’ this way

BRIDGER
Oh shit Whatta we do

FITZGERALD
We run Now

BRIDGER
Wheres Pig

FITZGERALD
Not our worry no more

BRIDGER
We gotta find him

FITZGERALD
If he ain’t already gutted and
scalped he’1ll find us

same grabs for his rifle standing near Glass

Bridger freezes in his panic he’d forgotten all about
Glass And now the wounded man’s eyes stare up at him
understanding perfectly what’s happening

BRIDGER
What about Mr Glass

FITZGERALD
He’s on his own same as you and
me

BRIDGER
I can’t leave him

FITZGERALD
Then I’m talkin’ to a dead man

Bridger’s frozen doesn’t know what to do So Fitzgerald
suddenly GRABS GLASS BY THE ANKLES starts dragging him
across the ground Glass GROANS IN PAIN

BRIDGER
Wait

But Fitzgerald isnt waiting he pulls Glass to that grave
he dug and ROLLS GLASS BODY INSIDE

Glass hits the bottom with a painful THUD
FITZGERALD
Now we done what was asked of us
(hard to Bridger)
Move

Bridger stares at the open grave a moment then fear sends
him running after Fitzgerald

as Glass lies there INSIDE HIS OWN GRAVE
CUT
GLASS’ POV - OUT OF THE GRAVE TIGHT AND CLAUSTROPHOBIC

JUST THE NIGHT SKY ABOVE AND THE SOUND OF HIS PAINFUL
BREATHS

TO

DISSOLVE TO

EXT WILDERNESS - MORNING

Cold and grey Fitzgerald crouches beside a small fire
warming his hands WHISPS OF SMOKE rise into the sky

FITZGERALD
We ran the better part of the
night Had to gain some ground on
Henry and the others

BRIDGER
Pig won’t know to catch us

FITZGERALD
He’1l have to

Bridger sits at the base of a tree his mind replaying the
desertion of Glass over and over He notices the smoke

BRIDGER
Best douse that smoke before them
‘Ree spot it

FITZGERALD
We put enough distance between us
and them And it’s too damn cold
to go without one

BRIDGER
All we know they hoofed it through
the night same as us

FITZGERALD
A dozen ‘Ree can’t make the time us
two did

Bridger looks back to the trees

BRIDGER
We shouldn’t a left him back there

Fitzgerald doesn’t respond And then Bridger considers
something stares at Fitzgerald a beat before

BRIDGER (contd)
It was twenty earlier

FITZGERALD
What

BRIDGER
When you woke me you said you’d
spotted twenty ‘Ree

FITZGERALD
A dozen twenty I was a little
too spooked to count feathers
Hell one ‘Ree was too many

Fitzgerald empties his canteen over the fire killing the
flames Bridger stares at the water pouring out

BRIDGER
What was you even doin’ down at the
creak in the middle of the night
(beat)
Id already brought plenty a water

Fitzgerald doesn’t answer Bridger tightens his grip on his
rifle slowly rises

BRIDGER (contd)
Answer me

FITZGERALD
Don’t start questionin’ me on
accounta you feelin’ guilty ‘bout
leavin’ your half-breed buddy
behind

Bridger musters up all the courage he can aims his rifle
at Fitzgerald

BRIDGER
ANSWER ME OR I BLOW YOUR DAMN HEAD
OFF
Fitzgerald stares back at Bridger and his rifle eyes

taking in everything a snake sizing up its prey Then
Fitzgerald stands takes a step toward the boy

FITZGERALD
What’re you askin’ Why it was you
turned your back on Glass Let him
die to save your own sorry skin
(beat)
‘Cause you was scared shitless
that’s why

BRIDGER
The ‘Ree did you see ‘em
(off Fitzgerald’s silence)
DID YOU SEE ‘EM

FITZGERALD
(moving closer)
Not a one

Bridger CRIES OUT starts to pull the trigger when
Fitzgerald’s hand flashes out grabbing the barrel and
shoving the butt back into Bridger’s face THWACK

The force of the blow knocks Bridger back to the ground but
Fitzgerald holds his grip on the rifle barrel flips it
around to aim it at the boy Blood drips down Bridger’s head
as he stares up at his rifle pointed down

FITZGERALD (contd)
I just needed to spur you on Pig
was lost and Glass was dead either
way There weren’t no point in us
waitin around to die too

Fitzgerald lines the barrel up at Bridger’s head his
FINGER TIGHTENS ON THE TRIGGER

FITZGERALD (contd)
So that there is the answer to your
question

And Fitzgerald PULLS THE TRIGGER AND BRIDGER SQUEEZES HIS
EYES SHUT IN FEAR THEN CLICK Bridger opens his eyes
sees Fitzgerald grinning down at him

FITZGERALD (contd)
And the next time you aim to kill
somebody boy best remember your
gun won’t fire without a flint

Fitzgerald tosses the rifle back at Bridger and turns away
Bridger’s face flushes with rage and humiliation he
charges Fitzgerald from behind tackles him to the
ground starts pounding Fitzgerald with punches

But it’s only a moment before Fitzgerald is in control
HEAD-BUTTING Bridger off of him tossing him away then
KICKING BRIDGER IN THE STOMACH AGAIN He grabs his
knife is ready to finish Bridger off

but Fitzgerald is smart enough to know that out here two
are safer than one even when one is just a kid He starts
walking away

BRIDGER
I’m goin’ back for him

FITZGERALD
Far as we ran you couldn’t find
Glass nor your dummy with dogs and
amap And I don’t believe you
want to ‘Cause after leavin’ him
to die I doubt he’d be too happy
to see you now

Fitzgerald digs at the dirt with the knife covers the
fire’s remains

FITZGERALD (contd)
And just so we’re clear If you
try to backtrack without me
knowin’ or ever get so guilty you
feel the need to tell somebody

Fitzgerald looks at Bridger hard evil
FITZGERALD (contd)

I’1l have no choice but to gut you
from nuts to nose

Fitzgerald stares his point home then shoves the blade into
his belt and stands

FITZGERALD (contd)
Now let’s go

Bridger wipes the blood from his face then throws one last
glance behind him before following Fitzgerald

EXT CAMP - MORNING

Empty and quiet no sign of life until GLASS’ HAND RISES
BETWEEN THE LOOSE BRANCHES His fingers dig into the earth
pulling himself up from the hole a dead man climbing out
of his own grave

He rolls out to the ground arches in pain when his back
hits the cold hard surface

Glass lies there shivering regaining what little strength he
has then rolls over glances around the camp his eyes
settle on the blanket

He starts dragging himself again with that one good arm
six inches at a time across the dirt finally makes it
to the blanket wraps it around him

Glass rests there in the center of camp unable to move
his eyes scanning the surroundings no food no water
and he’s wide open in this clearing an easy target for any

predator So he grabs his Possibles bag and GUNPOWDER HORN
and drags himself toward the cover of brush

And every movement takes all the will Glass has a push
with his good leg followed by a pull with his healthy arm
inch by inch foot by foot sweat pouring down his face
as he finally reaches the cover of the trees continues
on dragging himself across the forest floor ina
desperate hopeless crawl for survival

But finally it’s too much for Glass the fever and pain
overwhelm him He collapses falls unconscious

DISSOLVE TO

EXT WILDERNESS - NIGHT

From high above the forest the tree tops sway in the
breeze

EXT WILDERNESS - DAY

Glass dragging himself again his hands are torn and bloody
from clawing his weight

He stops unwraps his small leather Possibles bag dumps
it to the ground revealing it contents flints a straight
razor his map and a LEATHER NECKLACE WITH THE SIX-INCH BEAR
CLAW attached Glass grabs the razor cuts SEVERAL THIN
STRIPS FROM THE BLANKET and wraps them around his hands

He shoves the rest back in the bag and does the only thing
he can do start crawling again push with his healthy
leg pull with his good arm

EXT WILDERNESS - LATER

Glass dragging himself up a steep slope over rocks the
jagged edges catching the wounds tearing the primitive
stitching The gashes rip wider blood oozes down leaving
a crimson trail dripping down the rock behind him

And we TIGHTEN ON THE BLOOD UNTIL IT BECOMES DARK AS NIGHT

INT FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

BACK WHERE WE FIRST OPENED shadows illuminated by that
lanterns flame The dusty floor the bucket of water with
a rag hanging over the edge the Anstadt Rifle leaning
beside the bed that FRESH STAR COMPLETED IN ITS STOCK

Then we see Glass more clearly this time holding his
Son in his arms leaning close his face pressed to his
Sons ear

GLASS
(whispering)
Not yet not yet not yet

CUT TO

EXT WILDERNESS - NIGHT

And Glass lying beneath a cluster of brush shivering
bleeding conscious but delirious staring up at the
sky WHISPERING THOSE WORDS HIS WOUNDS WONT LET HIM SAY
over and over as a TEAR SLIPS FROM THE CORNER OF HIS EYE

EXT WILDERNESS - DAY

Glass pulling himself along the ground stopping because he
hears something RUSHING WATER

Glass digs his fingers into the ground with new energy
pulls himself toward the sound up over a ridge and
there it is at the bottom of the ridge

THE GRAND RIVER WATER Glass crawls down toward it

EXT GRAND RIVER - DAY

Glass at the river’s edge cupping handfuls of water and
rubbing it over his parched lips withstanding the pain to
gulp it down

Glass cups more water to his mouth but with each drink he
feels the water leak from a hole in his throat run down
his neck He leans out over the surface to check his
reflection sees the swollen stitched-together throat

He fights off the urge to vomit pulls the razor from the
leather bag and cuts more strips of blanket soaking them in
the river then cleaning his wounds

He runs a finger up to his shredded throat around the
open wet hole He cups another handful of water to his
mouth strains to swallow then feels the liquid GURGLE OUT
OF THE HOLE

Glass shoves the cloth against the wound tries to press
the flesh together no good He dumps out his Possibles
bag stares at the meager contents He picks up one of the
flints looks to the powderhorn

EXT GRAND RIVER - LATER
ANGLE ON A SMALL CLUMP OF DRIED GRASS

as Glass SPARKS one of the flints ignites the grass
As the fire grows Glass pours a handful of GUNPOWDER from
the horn and RUBS IT ALL OVER THE HOLE IN HIS THROAT

He lifts several small blades of burning grass a miniature
torch And only then do we realize what he’s about to do

because he stares at the flame a beat then raises it toward

his gunpowder-covered throat

The flame nears the black powder and LEAPS OFF THE GRASS
igniting the powder and SETTING GLASS’S NECK ON FIRE

Glass falls back to the ground in agony TRIES TO SCREAM
but his burning shredded vocal chords won’t allow him

The gunpowder sizzles and burns the flame spreads
Glass’ flesh sears melts and the pain is too much for
Glass he passes out

The smoke from his neck rises up into the blue sky
fades

and then the clouds begin to drift fast too fast
racing across the sky

«as we GLIDE BACK DOWN TO

GLASS - at the water’s edge drinking touching his
charred melted throat no leaks He slurps back more
then opens his Possibles bag pulls out the GRIZZLY CLAW
NECKLACE stares at it a beat then slips it over his head

He drags out a WORN MAP spreads it on the ground then
throws a glance around him fingers the point on the blue
line a rough guess of his location

ANGLE ON THE MAP

Fort Union at the top far north Other smaller
outposts south but not nearly as far away

Glass gazes north up the Grand as if he can see Fitzgerald
and Bridger just ahead of him Then he looks back down to
his reflection in the water battered and scarred He
touches his leg all but worthless for now his one good
arm It’s clear he’s not ready to take revenge on anyone

So Glass shoves the map back into the bag ties it around
his arm with the powderhorn and blanket then grabs a THICK
FALLEN LOG and labors it into the river

Glass crawls in behind it deeper until the current grows
strong enough to carry the weight of his mangled body
downstream Glass drapes his healthy arm over the log and
starts floating letting the river do the work

EXT GRAND RIVER - DAY

Winding through the open prairie Glass hangs onto the
log floats with the gentle current past a HERD OF ELK
grazing along the riverbank The animals dont even notice
Glass

EXT CAMP - DAY

Elks Tongue stands over Glass empty grave several
Warriors watch him study the scene the rags crisp with
dried blood the scattered remains of supplies Then Elks
Tongue notices a SINGLE BEAR CLAW resting in the dirt He
picks it up

EXT GRAND RIVER - NIGHT

Dark the moon hidden behind clouds A heavy mist hangs
over the river Glass is draped across the log eyes
closed letting the slow current carry him south But then
his eyes open because he hears something a LOW RUMBLE

Glass looks to the river banks too foggy to see anything
clearly The RUMBLE GROWS LOUDER He peers ahead too
dark to see much just ANOTHER SPLINTERED LOG floating in
front of him its one jagged branch rising up in the air

But then THE LOG VANISHES Glass squints through the fog
scanning the surface But it’s gone the water’s empty
that LOW RUMBLE GROWS EVEN LOUDER

Glass looks to the water beside him a BRANCH GLIDES PAST
AT A HIGHER SPEED And now Glass knows what’s coming but
it’s too late because the world suddenly turns upside
down as Glass tumbles over the edge of a TWENTY FOOT
WATERFALL

He spirals downward crashes into the rushing current
He’s washed forward with the suddenly violent rapids They
pull him under the surface then toss him GASPING back out

The river carries him blindly through the mist tossing
turning SLAMMING HIM INTO A HUGE BOULDER CRACK he
spins off swept away headfirst the foaming water sucking
him down the rocky gauntlet

He tumbles over more boulders his Possibles bag snaps
loose Glass makes a grab for it but is suddenly flipped
down another set of falls

The Possibles Bag is lost in the raging river

Glass sinks beneath the surface then floats back up as the
rapids calm spit Glass to the gentle shallows His body
drifts face-down toward shore

And just when we’re sure Glass has to finally be dead his
arm reaches up from the water his hand clamps onto the
muddy bank and drags his body out of the river

Glass collapses unconscious to the ground his body shrouded
in that mist

EXT GRAND RIVER - DAY

TIGHT ON THE LEFT SIDE OF GLASS’ FACE the right still
pressed into the muddy bank The sun beats down then
SHADOWS APPEAR BOUNCE ACROSS HIM something is standing
over Glass

And then a VULTURE’S HEAD DROPS INTO FRAME

latches its beak onto Glass’ cheek tugs at it
stretches it Glass’ eyes pop open we PULL BACK to see
THREE VULTURES surrounding Glass’ body pecking and clawing
at his battered wounds

Glass swings his good arm knocking one of the vultures away
He tries to cry out but only that PRIMITIVE HISS ERUPTS from
his throat

The vultures dance away from his flailing aren’t willing
to give up their meal so easily dart in for quick attacks
on his flesh

Glass grasps a branch swings at the birds beating them
back The vultures give up the battle fly away

Glass crumbles back to the ground squints up into the
sun the SILHOUETTES OF THE VULTURES CIRCLING ABOVE HIM
waiting for him to die

Glass glances to a ridge just a few hundred yards away

At the base of the ridge a GIANT BOULDER has broken free
creating a partial cave Glass starts crawling toward it

And if it’s possible he looks even closer to death now than
when he started this journey

EXT CAVE - DAY
No more than ten feet deep but enough to hide from

predators Glass slides as far back in the recess as he
can collapses against the rock wall

INT CAVE - DAY

Glass gathers loose sticks and grass into a small pile
begins sparking rocks together to build a fire

INT CAVE - LATER

The fire burns beside Glass as he TEARS A SINGLE THREAD of
cloth from the tattered blanket then feeds it through a tiny
hole in a JAGGED NEEDLE-SIZED SLIVER OF SHARPENED ROCK a
man-made needle and thread

Glass goes to work on the open wounds of his chest
piercing his skin with the rock wincing with pain as he
tugs the thread through the fresh hole in his skin pierces
the other side of the wound then pulls the flesh tightly
together before repeating the excruciating process all
over again pierce pull pierce tighten

EXT GRAND RIVER - NIGHT

The moon’s glow reflects off the water

INT CAVE - NIGHT
ANGLE ON GLASS’ HAND

-holding a small sharp stone and SCRATCHING LETTERS INTO
THE CAVE’S ROCK WALL

WE PAN DOWN TO THE GROUND still listening to the
SCRATCHING OF THE ROCK as we glide across the dirt reach
the fire its flame warm and strong

We TIGHTEN ON THE FIRE until WE’RE INSIDE IT and then WE
PULL BACK

-and we see the fire has long died away just black ash
The OS SCRATCHING has silenced We glide back across the

cave floor to Glass unconscious on the ground And above
him on the wall we see what he had been scratching

“Robbed and left to die by Fitzgerald Killed Pig to If
find him kill for Hugh Glass”

We hold on those words a beat then

DISSOLVE TO

EXT WILDERNESS - DAWN

Still dark and misty Bridger asleep beneath a thick cover
of trees An OS GUNSHOT springs his eyes open then
ANOTHER SHOT and ANOTHER

Bridger looks around sees Fitzgeralds gear but no
Fitzgerald Bridger scrambles to his feet

EXT SMALL CAMP - MORNING

TWO INDIAN PONIES prance anxiously pull at the ropes that
secure them to trees

And then we see why theyre jumpy Fitzgeralds standing
over the bodies of TWO DEAD CROW INDIANS gathering their
weapons He looks up sees Bridger standing in the mist
staring at the scene shocked

FITZGERALD
Theyda done the same if theyd
found us first

Bridger doesnt respond just watches Fitzgerald pull his
knife crouch over one of the bodies

FITZGERALD (contd)
Gather the horses We might even
survive to Union now

Then Fitzgerald moves the blade toward the Crows head
pulls the long black hair back

FITZGERALD (contd)
(to the dead body)

Be grateful I kilt you first
EXT GRAND RIVER - DAY
DROPS OF RAIN dot the surface THUNDER RUMBLES the rain
grows heavier
EXT CAVE - NIGHT
Rain pouring gullies of water run down the ridge spewing
over the mouth of the cave But inside Glass doesn’t
stir lying there just as we last saw him

EXT GRAND RIVER - DAY

Rain coming down in buckets The river’s swollen and
flooded raging

EXT WILDERNESS - NIGHT

Clouds drift across the moon the storm has ended

INT CAVE - DAY
TIGHT ON GLASS’ FACE eyes closed He looks dead

BOYS VOICE (VO)
Not yet Not yet

Glass eyes suddenly spring open

EXT CAVE - DAY

Glass crawls out of the crevice shields his eyes from the
sun as he takes in the scene

The river has sunk back to normal leaving the banks battered
and muddy The water is thick and brown with all the flooded
earth it pulled up

Glass uses all his strength to rise up to his knees then
higher onto his healthy leg He braces himself against a
tree He’s still crooked and hunched over but for the first
time since the Grizzly attack he looks more like a man than
an animal He bends down picks up a BROKEN TREE BRANCH

EXT GRAND RIVER - DAY

Glass limps along the bank beside the brown water stirred
up from the flood He moves along the washed-out area
searching for food grabs some plants tears them from
the ground to chew on the roots

He continues on spots a DEAD SNAPPING TURTLE drowned in
the flood frozen on its back Glass kneels down to pick up
the turtle sniffs it As he does he spots something
across the river a DEER staring back at him

Glass slowly raises his IMAGINARY RIFLE takes careful aim
at the deer pulls the trigger If only he had his Anstadt

But then the deer’s head snaps to something beyond Glass
Glass follows the animal’s eyes turns to the ridge and
sees FIVE ARIKARA WARRIORS STANDING AT GLASS’ CAVE

Glass drops flat to the ground behind a tree uprooted in the
flood He looks back across the river THE DEER IS GONE

INT CAVE - DAY

Elks Tongue stands at the wall staring at the words Glass
etched into the rock He picks up a piece of shredded
cloth sniffs it then says something to the Warriors

EXT GRAND RIVER - DAY

Glass inches his head up over the tree to Elks Tongue
now outside the cave studying the tracks

Glass’ eyes jump to the soft dirt along the river HIS
FOOTPRINTS an obvious trail leading right to him He
throws a glance around nowhere to run even if he could

So he starts backing into the river on his stomach feet-
first dragging a small branch over the tracks around him
wiping them away as he moves And his eyes are locked on the
Arikara watching to see if they spot him

But they haven’t yet and Glass keeps sliding backward
five feet off shore only three feet deep in the murky
water and sludge But if he goes any further the current
will catch him pull him into the next set of violent
rapids and make him a clear target

The Arikara follow the tracks down from the cave

Glass sinks neck-deep into the water the Arikara keep
coming near the river So Glass drops beneath the surface

CUT TO

UNDERWATER —

And Glass’ eyes spread wide searching the muddy water He
grabs a LARGE ROCK rolls onto his back and places the
rock on his stomach its weight holding him firmly to the
river bottom

EXT GRAND RIVER - DAY

ANGLE ON THE ARIKARA WARRIORS following Glass’ tracks to
the edge of the river looking out over the brown river

CUT TO

UNDERWATER —

Glass pressing his head back against the bottom staring up
through the cloudy water to the FIVE SHADOWS STANDING ONLY
A FEW FEET AWAY

EXT GRAND RIVER - CONTINUOUS

Elks Tongue and the others unknowingly standing just
above Glass looking back to the tracks scanning the
water But the surface is empty and the river’s too thick
with mud to see anything below

But they keep looking and we’re waiting for Glass to
explode from the river gasping for air But he doesn’t
and they keep scanning for what seems an eternity until
finally Elks Tongue turns the Warriors follow him back
toward the cave

Behind them Glass’ face inches to the surface pulls in
some oxygen watches as they fade into the trees

Then Glass rolls the rock away starts moving deeper into
the river fighting the current to grab rocks and
boulders pulling himself to the other side

EXT PRAIRIE - EVENING

Glass limps slowly across the rolling prairie He’s weak
starving isn’t going to make it much further He drops to
his hands and knees

And then he feels something the ground almost trembling
under his hands He watches his hands quiver with vibration
A RUMBLE BUILDS Glass strains to hear looks to the crest
of a hill labors up the gentle slope toward the sound

EXT PRAIRIEHILL - EVENING

Glass reaches the crest looks over the other side to a
HERD OF BUFFALO THUNDERING ACROSS THE PRAIRIE

An incredible site hundreds of massive creatures their
hooves tearing up the earth leaving a cloud of dust behind
them

Behind the herd a PACK OF WOLVES FIGHT OVER A FALLEN
BUFFALO

Glass lies in the high grass watching the wolves SNARL AND
SNAP over the remains And he eyes that buffalo the
closest he’s been to food in days

He scans the ground for a weapon nothing And then his
eyes settle on some DEAD SAGE BRUSH He grabs them along
with some sticks rocks pulls them into a pile

EXT PLAINS - NIGHT

The five wolves rest around the downed buffalo their snouts
bloody from the meal Suddenly one of the wolves’ heads
snaps up bares its teeth SNARLS

And then we see what the wolf is growling at Glass
limping out of the shadows toward the animals holding a
BURNING SAGE BUSH IN EACH HAND like giant FLAMING HANDS
clawing in the night

The wolves jump to their feet unsure of what’s approaching
They growl at Glass But Glass keeps coming doing his
best to YELL more like GROWL back at the wolves He swings
the flaming brush tossing glowing sparks through the air

The wolves spread out instinctively surrounding Glass But
Glass singles out each one charges waving the flames
driving each wolf back

Four of the wolves back away but the leader holds its
ground even moves toward Glass only a few feet away
SNARLING bloody jaws ready to attack but still not sure
what its up against

Glass shakes the flames at the wolf it SNAPS AT GLASS’
ARM Glass swings the other slams the fiery plant across
the wolf’s head

The wolf YELPS leaps back starts to run away but turns
back makes another charge at Glass But Glass is ready
throws the flaming ball of sage at the wolf then clubs it
with the other The animal’s fur begins to burn

The frightened wolf has had enough rolls on the ground
then spins to join the rest of its pack They run a safe
distance then stop keeping a watch on Glass

Glass drags the burning sage bushes along the ground
igniting the grass and brush creating a foot-high flaming
wall between him and the wolves

He stretches the flame into a circle a fiery ring surrounds
the fallen buffalo

The wolves have seen enough turn race away from the
flames

As the grass around him burns Glass drops the sage plants
attacks the buffalo remains tearing away bloody chunks of
flesh from the carcass and shoving them into his mouth a
starving animal that’s finally found food

EXT PRAIRIE - NIGHT

From high above the prairie Glass and the buffalo at the
center of that glowing ring of fire

EXT PRAIRIE - DAY

The wind’s gusting bending the high golden grass over on
its side Glass moves slowly across pulling his collar up
to shield his face from the cold winds He spots something
in the distant sky ahead a THIN LINE OF BLACK SMOKE
Glass picks up his pace hope spurring him on

EXT BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - DAY

The charred skeletal remains of a tribe’s village just
black posts where tee-pees once stood a half-burned log
lodge still smokes sending that black line into the sky

Glass limps through the graveyard of structures all signs
of life in this village long gone He searches a basket
pulls out a BLANKET wraps it around his shoulders

INT LODGE - DAY

Glass steps into the smoky warmth of the lodge black and
empty He slides down to the floor unwraps strips of
roasted buffalo from what’s left of his blanket He starts to
take a bite when SOMETHING DARTS PAST THE DOORWAY TO THE
BACK ROOM The OS SHUFFLING OF FEET

Glass freezes he isn’t alone He rises grabs a
splintered post like a spear eases toward the doorway
raises the post to swing

--and sees the SMALL PUPPY standing in the back room The
dog takes off around a crumbled wall Glass follows it

INT LODGEBACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Glass limps across the room turns the corner of the
crumbled wall and sees the dog slide to a stop beside an
ANCIENT ARIKARA WOMAN huddled in the corner her bony arms
outstretched in front of her in weak defense And her eyes
are SOLID WHITE the old woman is blind She CRIES OUT A
CHANT over and over her death chant as she waits for this
stranger to kill her

Glass stands frozen confused He tries to speak but his
throat still won’t let him He crouches down in front of the
old woman reaches for her hand but she flails him away

He grabs her again gently just holds it until she
calms studying the woman her hollow face all skin and
bones she’s obviously dying

He pulls the strip of buffalo meat from his pocket pushes
it into the woman’s hand She immediately jerks it to her
mouth and that’s when Glass sees the WOMAN HAS NO TEETH
she can’t eat

Glass turns to an old pot tipped over on the floor

EXT BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - DAY

Glass carries the pot toward a nearby stream The dog
scurries out behind him follows Glass to the water

INT LODGEBACK ROOM - DAY

The pot boils over burning logs Glass dips a cup in
pulling out a warm broth He carries it to the woman still
sitting in the corner takes her hand placing the cup in
it for her She gulps the liquid back

Glass goes back to refill the cup The old woman MUMBLES
SOMETHING we can’t understand over and over as Glass
brings the cup back to her He tries to ease it into her
hand but the woman pushes it away slides her hand up
Glass’ arm to his face patting it MUMBLING THOSE SAME
WORDS thanking Glass

EXT BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - EVENING
Glass carries several blankets toward the lodge The puppy

trails behind him biting at one of the corners hanging on
as Glass pulls him across the dirt

INT LODGE - EVENING

Glass enters the back room with the blankets stops when he
sees the old woman slumped over to the floor her white eyes
frozen open in a lifeless stare the cup of broth spilled
beside her

The dog scampers over starts licking up the wet remains of
the broth

EXT BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - NIGHT

Glass has stacked several burned posts into a crude pyre at
the edge of the village The woman lies atop the pyre
covered in the blankets he gathered for her

EXT DISTANT RIDGE - CONTINUOUS

THREE INDIANS sit on horseback watching Glass walk away from
the pyre

EXT BURNED ARIKARA VILLAGE - NIGHT

As Glass and the dog walk across the village something
else appears beyond them

-THOSE THREE INDIANS GALLOPING TOWARD THE VILLAGE FAST

Glass hears them turns knows it’s too late to run so
he just stands there The dog’s seen enough darts away

Glass watches the Indians ride into the village their
braided hair and dress is different than the Arikara we’ve
seen earlier because these are SIOUX WARRIORS and Glass
knows it

The Sioux surround Glass on horseback stare down at him
The lead warrior (SPOTTED HORSE) (30s) poised and strong
points to the pyre says something to Glass

Glass tries to answer can’t touches his scarred throat
Spotted Horse slides gracefully off his horse The other two
warriors (THREE FEATHERS and RUNNING FOX) do the same
close in on Glass

Glass stands firm Spotted Horse questions Glass again And
again Glass touches his throat holds his jacket out from
his sides no weapons Spotted Horse studies Glass hard
spots Glass’ necklace the grizzly claw hanging from it

He examines the enormous claw then nods to Glass’ stitching
and scars

SPOTTED HORSE
Griz-—lee

Glass hears the familiar word nods Three Feathers SNIFFS
GLASS says something to Spotted Horse

Spotted Horse walks around Glass spots the BLOOD STAINS
along the back of Glass shirt Spotted Horse pulls out his
knife

Glass is confused holds up his hand as he takes a step
back But Three Feathers and Running Fox grab Glass
secure him as Spotted Horse raises the knife

Glass GROWLS A PLEA but Spotted Horse slices the knife
down Glass’ back just cutting open his shirt

»and revealing a MASS OF WHITE WORMS MAGGOTS COVERING
GLASS’ BACK

The three warriors exchange glances they’ve obviously
never seen anything like this Glass sees their reaction
tries to pull away but Spotted Horse SLAMS THE BUTT OF HIS
KNIFE against Glass’ head

Glass drops to his knees crumbles unconscious to the dirt

Spotted Horse says something to the others they drag Glass
toward the horses throw him over the back of Three
Feathers horse then ride out of the village

EXT SIOUX VILLAGE - NIGHT

Dozens of glowing campfires dot the prairie along with a sea
of tee-pees their willow poles fanning against the night
sky Animal hides and painted designs decorate the various
tee-pees and lodges SIOUX CHILDREN laugh and play about the
village freeze when they hear Spotted Horse and the other
riders splash across the stream

The warriors ride into the village Glass’ body still tossed
over the back of Three Feather’s horse The children race to
them

ANGLE ON GLASS regaining consciousness eyes blinking
trying to focus

CUT TO

GLASS’ POV - FROM THE BACK OF THE HORSE

to the children’s eager faces swarming around him

Spotted Horse - YELLING SOMETHING at the children they
back away from Glass fall into line behind the riders

Sioux MEN and WOMEN watch as the procession moves past to
a tee-pee set away from the rest its hide walls decorated
with wild lightning bolts and buffalo and vaguely human
figures circling the sun

An OLD MEDICINE MAN gnarled and leathery a DEAD RAVEN tied
in his long hair his naked chest painted with red and black
stripes steps out of the tee-pee He eyes Glass as Three
Feathers and Running Fox carry him inside

Suddenly the Medicine Man begins CHANTING

CUT TO
A FLURRY OF IMAGES ACCOMPANIED BY THE MEDICINE MAN’S VO
CHANTING

LEATHER STRAPS SNAPPING AROUND GLASS’ WRISTS AND ANKLES
stretched tight

Glass naked on his stomach at the center of the tee-pee
his arms and legs outstretched secured to wooden stakes in
the ground The infected wounds exposed

The Medicine Man CHANTING waving burning sticks in the
air

A THICK LIQUID BOILING IN A POT the Medicine Man’s twisted
hand reaching a gourd container in filling it with the
steaming mixture

The liquid POURING OVER GLASS’ BACK

GLASS’ FACE arched to the sky twisted in horrible pain
He SCREAMS THAT HORRIBLE GROWLING CRY

MORE IMAGES even faster the CHANTING more frantic
A SIOUX WOMAN (WAKI) staring down
HANDS pouring HOT OIL over Glass wounds

The Medicine Man dancing chanting shaking sticks lined
with RATTLESNAKE TAILS

The moonlight shining through the tee-pee illuminating the
images of the buffalo and dancing shapes

The LITTLE BOY (Glass Son) standing over Glass just
watching him

Waki gently pouring fluid into Glass’ mouth

The Medicine Man holding the SEVERED HEAD OF A SNAKE
lightly sinking the fangs around the wounds on Glass’ throat

GLASS EYES wide open rolling up white into his head

AND THE CHANTING STOPS the world goes dark

EXT YELLOWSTONE RIVER - DAY

Cutting through the open prairie Snow-covered peaks touch
the sky in the distance

Fitzgerald and Bridger dressed in furs ride the two horses
bareback across the prairie They rise up a steep slope
reach the top and spot the cluster of log buildings inside a
massive thirty-foot tall wooden fence Fort Union

Bridger smiles relieved

FITZGERALD
“Bout goddamn time

Fitzgerald gives Bridger a stern gaze

FITZGERALD (contd)
And we’re understood on

agreed

Bridger doesn’t respond Fitzgerald doesn’t like that

FITZGERALD (contd)

tossin’ it away when he was as good
as dead already Shit all we did
was skip the funeral

Bridger keeps riding away Fitzgerald follows behind

INT FORT UNION - DAY

Like a small town surrounded by a log wall The main TRADING
POST BUILDING is busy TRAPPERS SIOUX all with things to
trade But most of the life is in the FORT UNION SALOON next
door crowded with customers downstairs and just as busy
in the whores’ rooms upstairs

A small village of tents rests off to the side of the
buildings holding the overflow of traffic

INT ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - DAY

from him The others Anderson Murphy and Stubby Bill
crowd the room behind them

FITZGERALD
We figure Pig musta wandered too
far got turned around or jumped

by some ‘Ree Me and the kid

Fitzgerald looks to Bridger for confirmation Bridger
manages a slight nod

HENRY
What about Glass

FITZGERALD
I won’t pretend to been his friend
but I respect any man that fights
the way he done

HENRY
And the grave

FITZGERALD
We had those extra days so we went
deeper covered it in rocks To
keep the scavengers off him

HENRY
Any sign of hostiles

FITZGERALD
Not a one

The words are like a punch in the gut to Bridger He can’t
take the pain opens his mouth to speak but Fitzgerald
beats him to it

FITZGERALD (contd)
Truth is I was worried ‘bout ‘Ree
and ready to get movin’ but
Bridger here argued to stay and
make a cross for the grave

Bridger’s head snaps to Fitzgerald don’t make this worse

FITZGERALD (contd)
So that’s what we did

Stubby Bill reaches up gives Bridger a pat on the back
But to Bridger it feels like a red-hot blade

HENRY
Glad to hear you pulled your
weight Mr Bridger I knew you
would

FITZGERALD
More than his share Captain

And now Fitzgerald has snared Bridger into his lie Bridger
drops his eyes to his feet

HENRY
Speaking of shares

Henry turns to a SAFE resting against the wall Fitzgerald
watches as Henry spins the dial locks in the combination
then pulls the latch The safe door swings open

-revealing STACKS OF CASH

Fitzgerald’s eyes lock on all that money Henry pulls out a
handful starts counting them out onto the desk

HENRY (contd)
Am I to assume the agreed
arrangement didn’t change

FITZGERALD
Fortunate for me it did not

HENRY
Well thank you both for your
courage and honor

Fitzgerald swipes up his pile of bills Henry drops a couple
bills in front of Bridger

HENRY (contd)
Youre owed something for what you
did

Bridger stares down at the bills a beat then turns leaves
them there as he pushes his way out of the office Henry
looks to Fitzgerald

FITZGERALD
He’s beat hisself up most of the

flap of the tee-pee limping out into the midday sun and
shielding his eyes He looks like a man that hasn’t seen the
light of day for weeks

Glass adjusts to the brightness stares in wonder at the
scene And then we see what Glass is looking at and
understand his reaction

the entire village is blanketed in snow The Sioux VILLAGERS
move about wearing heavy skins and furs

A WOMEN’S OS VOICE turns Glass

to WAKI the woman from the images walking toward him
bundled in fur She says something else we can’t
understand points to Glass’ feet Glass looks down to

the speck that is Hugh Glass alone at the center walking
north

But you can barely tell if it’s day or night through the
blizzard Fitzgerald Anderson Bridger Murphy and Stubby
Joe trudge through the storm in their snowshoes finally
reach the bunkhouse

INT BUNKHOUSE - EVENING

Anderson shoves the door closed against the wind latches

it The men look worn and battered wind-burnt faces
icicles in their beards

ANDERSON

BRIDGER
We gave him our word to honor a
promise That counts for
somethin To some folks anyway

Its clear Bridger is talking straight to Fitzgerald And
Fitzgerald throws Bridger a glare wants to throw more but
Bridger’s returning the stare hard so Fitzgerald
decides he’d better not push it

FITZGERALD
You hadnt lived long enough to
preach to me boy Come to me
after lifes spit in your face
took away all you ever had Then
Ill let you cry honor from your
pulpit

The bunkhouse goes silent Fitzgerald turns his look on the
others

FITZGERALD (contd)
What about the rest of ya

The others trade glances no takers
FITZGERALD (contd)
Rather keep slavin it for Henry
huh Least we should push to up
our pay

FITZGERALD (contd)
Jesus Not much backbone in this

STUBBY BILL
No stoppin you from goin Fitz

Thats a challenge And Fitzgerald never backs down from one
of those He grabs his gloves starts strapping his
snowshoes back on

FITZGERALD
Itll only be on my interests I
argue for

Fitzgerald walks out leaves the door wide open for the
cold wind to pour over the others Anderson scurries over
shoving it closed

INT ROCKY MOUNTAIN FUR COMPANY OFFICE - DAY
Fitzgerald enters sees Henry working at his desk

FITZGERALD
I need to talk to you Captain

HENRY
(without looking up)
What is it this time Fitzgerald

But Fitzgerald doesnt answer not right off because he
just spotted the SAFE DOOR CRACKED OPEN behind Henry
STACKS OF MONEY visible inside

Henry looks up at Fitzgerald snapping Fitzgeralds focus
back
FITZGERALD
Wanted to ask about my contract
Henry stands up carries the papers to the door
HENRY

to tend to

FITZGERALD
Yes sir Captain

Henry walks out as Fitzgeralds eyes drift back to that
safe

EXT WILDERNESS - EVENING

Glass crouches beside a stream cupping handfuls of water to
his lips He HEARS 0OS MOVEMENT looks up

to Spotted Horse just across the stream sitting on his
horse holding a spear and wearing Glass Grizzly Claw
Necklace And hes leading a PAINT MARE behind him loaded
with a BEAR HIDE COAT

SPOTTED HORSE
Need horse ride to Yoon-yun

EXT WILDERNESSCAMP - NIGHT

Tucked under the rooftop of trees Glass and Spotted Horse
are crouched beside a fire-bed no flames no smoke
just warmth Glass is wearing the Bear Hide

Spotted Horse pulls off his own BEADED CHESTPLATE holds it
out to Glass

GLASS
Youve already done plenty for me

SPOTTED HORSE
Bring luck in hunt

Glass nods takes the chestplate slipping it on

GLASS
Thank you

SPOTTED HORSE
Spend life hunting enemy Enemy
win

GLASS
It will be over soon

Glass and Spotted Horse hold a look Then Spotted Horse
looks to the Grizzly Claw

SPOTTED HORSE
Was big griz-lee

GLASS
Yes

Spotted Horse smiles And thats when the ARROW BURSTS
THROUGH THE FRONT OF HIS CHEST

-and Glass looks up sees SEVERAL DARK SHAPES RUSHING
THROUGH THE TREES TOWARD THEM

Spotted Horse reaches for Glass crumbles over just as
theres an OS SNAP BEHIND GLASS

Glass spins in time to see an ARIKARA WARRIOR SWINGING A
HATCHET

Glass dives scooping up Spotted Horses spear driving it
into the air shoving it through the Warriors stomach

The dark woods suddenly ERUPT IN WAR CRIES Arikara appear
from all sides

Glass tears the knife from Spotted Horses sheath
scrambles up races toward the Paint Mare as ARROWS PIERCE
THE AIR ALL AROUND HIM

Glass swings up onto the Paint Mare spots ELK’S TONGUE
leading the charge the necklace of ears hanging around his
neck And Elk’s Tongue’s eyes are locked on Glass almost
like he remembers him

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

Glass hanging onto the paint mare as she gallops through the
trees the animal’s nostrils spread wide pulling in all
the oxygen it can

Glass glances back sees SHAPES BEHIND HIM HORSES
ridden by Elk’s Tongue and a DOZEN OTHER WARRIORS

Glass digs his heels into the horse squeezing every ounce of
speed from her legs pushing her toward the clearing up
ahead throwing another glance back then looking in
front of him and realizing it isn’t a clearing at all

it’s the edge of the world
The paint mare explodes from the trees then runs out of
ground because she’s just galloped off the side of a

cliff

The horse sails downward toward a thick forest of trees its
legs flailing for something to stand on

Glass grips the horse’s mane hanging on for what seems an
endless fall

The mare SLAMS LEG-FIRST INTO THE TREE-TOPS with Glass still
on her back The Paint Mare SQUEALS as she smashes through
the snow-covered trees carrying Glass with her

CUT TO
EXT FOREST - CONTINUOUS
And the horse comes crashing through the branches the
massive limbs slowing her fall snapping off as her body
hits and twists tosses Glass away
Glass sails through the air hits a slope and tumbles down
into a stream of icy water
Sinks below the surface a moment long enough that were
sure he has to be dead until he rises from the water

drags himself up to the snowy ground collapses
shivering staring up through the trees

to Elk’s Tongue and his Warriors peering down from the top
of the cliff with no way to get to Glass Finally they
turn disappear

EXT WOODS - NIGHT

Glass moves shivering through the trees his body soaked
clothes beginning to ice over body convulsing from the
cold

when he finds the DEAD PAINT MARE twisted on the forest
floor

Glass grabs the loose blanket from the snow shakily wraps
it around himself But its worthless in this frigid night
air Glass is going to freeze to death

He stares at the dead horse a beat then pulls the knife

back and SLAMS IT INTO THE HORSE’S STOMACH begins slicing
the mare’s belly open His hands shake so much he can barely
control the knife

Blood and organs spill out staining the snow Steam rises
from the remains Glass keeps on cutting turning his head
from the smell as he pulls out whatever doesn’t ooze out on
its own emptying the carcass

Glass peels off his wet furs then does what we didn’t think
was possible he begins crawling feet-first into the
horse’s hollow belly holding its ribs up so he can slip
inside curling up SQUISHING IN deeper deeper
until only his head remains outside of the horse

Glass wraps the blanket around his face and head doing
everything he can to survive

DISSOLVE TO

EXT WILDERNESS - MORNING

The dead horse its fur white and icy Glass’ blanket-
wrapped head still protruding from the seam in its stomach
And nothing’s moving the whole world looks frozen stiff

until Glass’ head shifts the CRACKING OF FROZEN FLESH
as he lifts the upper half of the mares belly It’s like a
cocoon tearing open He rolls out of the carcass hitting
the ground and squinting up into the warmth of the sun

The horse’s blood covers his clothes He slides the frozen
fur back over himself then gazes up at the sun for
direction starts walking Alone in the middle of
nowhere again

EXT OPEN COUNTRY - DAY

From high above the small shape of Glass making his way
across the snowy ground heading toward TWO DISTANT SHACKS

EXT FORT TALBOT - DAY

A makeshift town on the banks of the Missouri Two
ramshackle structures the General Store and a tattered
livery stable

INT FORT TALBOTGENERAL STORE - DAY

More like a saloon that sells a few supplies A gang of
TRAPPERS drink and play cards A RUNTY MAN stands behind the
counter watching them

--until the door blows open and in steps Glass The men
stop what theyre doing watch him limp silently to the
wood stove pants stained with the mare’s blood ice
frozen in his beard

TRAPPER 1 SNORTS A LAUGH The Runty Man eyes the SIOUX
CHESTPLATE as Glass warms his hands his face Finally

FAT TRAPPER

And that’s when Trapper 1 grabs for Glass and the
chestplate but in a flash of movement that catches them all
off-guard Glass has is own knife pulled and JAMMED UNDER
TRAPPER 1s CHIN Everyone freezes

GLASS (cont’d)

Then Glass slides Trapper 1s PISTOL from his belt aims
it at the other men

GLASS (cont’d)
And this shooter here All made
good by Captain Henry and The Rocky
Mountain Fur Company

EXT FORT TALBOT - DAY

The snow pours down on the Runty Man and the trappers as
they stand outside rifles aimed into the distance

RUNTY MAN
Shoot him goddammit

TRAPPER 2
I can’t get a clear look

RUNTY MAN
Shoot ‘em both

The Runty Man snatches one of the rifles BOOM fires a
wild shot past the riders

CUT TO

GLASS - GALLOPING AWAY ON HORSEBACK

with Trapper 1 sitting backward on the horse behind him
Glass has the pistol jammed into his ribs and keeps glancing
back to the men growing smaller behind him

Finally Glass shoves the man off the back of the horse
Trapper 1 tumbles into the snow

The RUMBLE OF DISTANT GUNSHOTS too far away to reach
Glass who just keeps racing north

CUT TO

THE RUNTY MAN - WATCHING GLASS ESCAPE

RUNTY MAN
Get after the bastard

The trappers exchange glances don’t move

TRAPPER 2
It’s cold as hell Cees

The Runty Man glares at the trappers

EXT OPEN COUNTRY - EVENING

EXT FORT UNION - NIGHT

Thick with fog and silent as death The moon fights its way
through the mist sending an eerie glow over the fort

EXT FORT UNIONBLOCKHOUSE - NIGHT

Stubby Bill sits dozing in a chair his rifle across his lap
OS CRUNCHING getting louder loud enough to nudge
Stubby Bill awake

He sits up peers over the wall but can’t see anything in
the fog just hears the CRUNCHING MOVING CLOSER
FOOTSTEPS IN THE CRISP SNOW

CUT TO

STUBBY BILL’S POV

on the blanket of fog hanging in the air that same
CRUNCHING as a SHADOW APPEARS growing clearer a FIGURE
walking leading a horse behind him appearing out of the
mist like a ghost GLASS

STUBBY BILL - STARES DOWN IN SHOCK

-sure his eyes are betraying him But then Glass looks
straight up at Stubby Bill and there’s no doubt

STUBBY BILL
Jesus Christ

INT BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT

Dark and quiet just snoring rattling the silence
Suddenly the door kicks open SLAMS into the wall and
there’s GLASS’ SILHOUETTE FILLING THE DOORWAY HOLDING THAT
STOLEN PISTOL AT HIS SIDE

GROANS from the awakened men hands moving through the dark
for oil lamps turning them bright until the room’s
fully lit and they all see Glass standing there eyes
floating across the room searching for a target

The men just stare back at him like they’re all part of the
same dream

Except for Bridger who’s propped up in his cot like he’s
been waiting all night waiting every night for Glass to
appear in that doorway

BRIDGER
I’m sorry

The other men just watch in silence not sure what the hell’s
going on

Glass holds his stare on Bridger’s face a face that’s
haunted him kept him alive
GLASS
You took everything I had left

me to die

Glass walks toward Bridger each step of his feet on the
wood floor is like the thud of an executioner’s drum

MUMBLING from the other men as they watch this ghost reach
Bridger stand over him

BRIDGER

(beat)
But every day since I’ve wished I
had

A long beat then

BRIDGER

Glass flinches almost like he didnt want that to be true
BRIDGER (contd)

But I didnt know that til later

Bridgers face suddenly looks very young just a boy’s a
scared boy not the face Glass had pictured in his mind for
so long And suddenly Glass seems almost ashamed sad
even
GLASS

GLASS

Glass considers that a moment then walks out

track him that is a fact

So Fitzgerald spins takes off Glass will have to catch
him first

EXT WILDERNESS - DAY

Open country No cover to hide anywhere Fitzgerald is off
his horse leading it up an icy slope

And then DISTANT GUNSHOTS SCREAMS echoing around him
Fitzgerald peers back into the distance no way to see

where its coming from but those SCREAMS are definitely
real

And for the first time Fitzgerald looks truly frightened
as if those screams have haunted him for years

His eyes dance around he spins searching for an
attacker but hes all alone

So he hurries up the slope swings onto the horse and digs
his heels into the horses ribs gallops over the snow

EXT FORT TALBOT - DAY

At least what was Fort Talbot now just charred
smoldering wooden skeletons burned to the ground

And the scalped one-eared corpses of the Runty Man and
Trappers are strung up on posts like gruesome scarecrows

Glass and Henry sit on their horses looking at the scene
the tracks heading south

HENRY

disappearing

He spots something in the distance the slightest of glows
Glass eases off his horse wraps the reins around a branch

EXT WILDERNESS - NIGHT

Henry’s already off his horse leading it through the
trees searching as he walks
94

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

Glass moves silently through the darkness rifle poised to
aim and fire just like the first time we saw him
perfectly comfortable in this world

His eyes shine in the darkness drifting back and forth
picking up everything

He reaches the glow the remains of a campfire The
slightest bit of dying smoke rises into the air Glass
crouches down studying the surround ground HOOF-PRINTS
blended in with the other tracks

EXT WILDERNESS - NIGHT

Henry’s horse is making too much noise with each step He
stops walking wraps the reins around a tree walks back
around the horse

-AND THERE’S FITZGERALD STARING AT HIM Glass’ Anstadt
aimed and ready to fire

FITZGERALD
Didn’t figure an important man like
yourself to be away from your stove
on a night as cold as this
Captain You lost

Henry just stares back at Fitzgerald and that rifle His
eyes drift to his own rifle still strapped onto his saddle

HENRY
I’m here to save your life

FITZGERALD
Is that right Well I done told
you boys I don’t need savin’ by
nobody

Henry knows he’s only got one chance he makes a grab for
the rifle

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

Glass running his fingers across the tracks Suddenly an

OS GUNSHOT EXPLODES IN THE DISTANCE Glass spins to it
races back through the trees toward his horse

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

Glass at full gallop through the woods veering between
trees ducking branches

EXT WILDERNESS - NIGHT

Glass charges from the forest spots Henry’s horse standing
in the trees tears through the snow toward it leaps off
the still-moving animal in a fluid slide hits the ground
with his rifle ready

and sees HENRY’S BODY face-up in the snow

Glass drops to a knee scans the darkness as he slides
over to Henry

and we see he’s a bloody mess a GUNSHOT WOUND in his
chest leaking out onto the snow HIS HEAD SCALPED LEFT
EAR SLICED OFF

GLASS
You shouldn’t a come

As Glass looks at Henry he notices something takes Henry
by the chin and tilts his head And HENRY’S RIGHT EAR HAS
BEEN CUT OFF AS WELL

Sioux Left ear of whites

Glass looks up from Henrys corpse squints out into the
forest

EXT WILDERNESSCLEARING - NIGHT

Glass on horseback leading Henry’s horse behind him across
the snow-covered meadow Henry’s fur-covered body is draped
over the saddle

EXT FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT

A thick layer of ice covers the narrow river thinning just a
bit at the center Glass kneels near the middle chopping at
the thick ice to get to the water beneath He makes a
hole dips his canteen down into it glancing around into
the darkness

Then Glass turns stares up a slope into the dark forest
beyond like he knows what’s waiting for him there

He walks to the horses tied in the trees at the base of the
slope Henry still laying across the saddle of his horse in
his bloody furs

Glass SNAPS A BRANCH FROM A FALLEN TREE looks back up that
slope

EXT WILDERNESS - NIGHT
OUR POV FROM DEEP IN THE FOREST

watching from a low angle in the shadowy brush as Glass
appears up over the distant slope riding through the
trees with Henry draped over the horse behind

The forest is quiet just the CRACKING of crusty snow and
branches under the horses’ hooves

Then BOOM as the ANSTADT BARREL WE HADN’T SEEN BESIDE US
FLASHES IN THE NIGHT

and Glass tumbles off his horse

The horses prance around nervously then settle and then
FITZGERALD RISES FROM THE BRUSH BESIDE US eases toward the
horses reloading the Anstadt as he moves

He reaches Glass face down in the snow his furs covering
him

And Fitzgerald has that rifle aimed ready for Glass to
suddenly roll over firing

but Glass doesn’t move Fitzgerald nudges him with his
boot then rolls him over

and instead of Glass we see HENRY’S LIFELESS FACE HIDDEN
BENEATH THE FURS and that BROKEN BRANCH sticking up along
his back

ANGLE FROM BEHIND HENRY’S HORSE

-On the REST OF THE BRANCH RIGGED TO GLASS’ SADDLE to hold
Henry upright

--and then what we thought was Henry flung over the second
horse MOVING the bloody fur-covered arm lifting a
rifle the head rising up it’s GLASS taking aim

as Fitzgerald realizes what’s happened spins with the
Anstadt

to Glass laying across the horse rifle dead set on
Fitzgerald BOOM BOOM both rifles explode

Fitzgerald goes flying backward into the brush

Fitzgerald’s wild shot hits Henry’s horse sending it rearing
up tossing Glass to the ground

But Glass is on his feet in a flash reloading as he
charges into the brush

--but FITZGERALD IS GONE

Until the flash of movement behind Glass he turns as
the butt of the Anstadt whips through the air WHACK
clubs him across the head sending him tumbling down the
slope to the frozen river

Fitzgerald swings the Anstadt back over his BLOODY SHOULDER
snatches up his knife and charges down the slope to finish
Glass off

EXT FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT

Glass lies on the ice barely conscious Blood oozes down
his head over his eyes He wipes it away to see
Fitzgerald barreling down toward him

Fitzgerald dives in attack but Glass kicks up his leg
sending Fitzgerald flying over SLAMMING into the frozen
river his head CRACKING THE ICE

Glass rips the knife from his belt moves after Fitzgerald
his feet slipping and sliding under him

Fitzgerald rises to his feet the men charge like two wild
animals crash into each other knives flailing

They roll along the ice blades glistening slicing through
furs across flesh this battle is just as violent as
Glass bout with that Grizzly

Fitzgerald thrusts his knife down plants it through the
back of Glass’ hand pinning it to the ice Glass CRIES
OUT drops his own knife to pull Fitzgerald’s out

As he does Fitzgerald kicks Glass in the face sending him
sailing back sliding to the center of the river

The thin ice around him splinters cracks Glass looks
up sees Fitzgerald stalking toward him HOLDING BOTH
KNIVES now Glass is trapped

--until he pounds his elbow down on the weakened ice it
begins to give he pounds it again Fitzgerald speeds up
to get to Glass in time raises one of the knives just
as Glass shatters the ice drops beneath the surface

Fitzgerald rushes after him but the ice cracks under his
feet forcing him back

CUT TO

UNDERWATER

and Glass just below the ice floating with the current
His fingers search for a hole but there’s nothing

CUT TO
CUT TO
FITZGERALD
making his way down the river peering through the ice
searching for Glass He spots something stops leans
close to make out the shape it’s GLASS’ FEET

Then suddenly GLASS’ FIST EXPLODES THROUGH THE ICE AT
FITZGERALDS FEET grab Fitzgerald’s leg pulling him down

Fitzgerald crashes to the ice it splinters around him
gives away and he sinks into the icy water but the
ANSTADT STRAPPED AROUND HIM CATCHES ON THE ICE holds him
against the current

Glass drags himself from the water stands stares down
at Fitzgerald trapped in the hole his face looking up at
Glass through the ice Glass lifts one of the fallen
knives stands over Fitzgerald

FITZGERALD
(through the water and
ice)
Help me

(off Glass’ stare)
Glass please

Glass hesitates a beat staring at him just as he did with
Bridger that night in the bunkhouse And then Glass leans
down grabs the Anstadt to pull Fitzgerald up

Except Glass SLICES THE BLADE ACROSS THE STRAP OF THE
ANSTADT

sends Fitzgerald floating away under the ice as Glass
holds on to the Anstadt

CUT TO

FITZGERALD

careening under the surface pounding at the ice as he
drifts until his swinging slows stops his dead body
drifts away

EXT FROZEN RIVER - NIGHT

Glass stands on the ice blood dripping down his face
holding his Anstadt He begins to tremble not from the
cold but from finally reaching the end of this journey He
looks at the rifle and his eyes begin to fill with tears

Then a NOISE from across the river

and Glass looks up sees ELK’S TONGUE standing on the
opposite side of the river staring back at Glass

And Jesus we thought Glass might make it through this but
then shapes appear on each side of Elks Tongue a DOZEN
ARIKARA WARRIORS all ready for a massacre

Glass and Elk’s Tongue exchange a long stare until finally
Glass SCREAMS OUT

GLASS
I am Mato Wicasa I have killed
whites and I have killed Arikara
and I have killed grizzly AND I
WILL KILL YOU

Elk’s Tongue doesn’t move just stares back at Glass
soaked in blood and water Then Glass CRIES OUT at the
warriors again

GLASS (cont’d)
COME ON

But the Arikara don’t attack don’t move at all until
Elk’s Tongue finally just gives Glass the SLIGHTEST OF NODS
then turns they disappear back into the trees

Glass watches the Arikara fade into the night He looks down
to that Anstadt in his hand the CARVED STAR he allows
the faintest of smiles

then Glass legs weaken he drops to his knees on the
ice He looks down spots the MATTED BLOOD on his furs
isnt sure whose blood it is Then he pulls the furs back
from his stomach reveals the LARGE CRIMSON STAIN SPREADING
OVER HIS SHIRT

Its Glass blood and theres a lot of it

Glass eases back until hes just sitting there on the icy
river staring across into the trees

The world seems suddenly peaceful like Glass has it all to
himself until OS FOOTSTEPS CRUNCHING in the forest
behind Glass He doesnt turn toward it

CUT TO
POV FROM THE WOODS BEHIND GLASS
Slowly moving through the trees easing toward Glass
still on the river
GLASS - Sitting there with his rifle hearing the
FOOTSTEPS but hes too weak to move too weak to fight

anymore

The FOOTSTEPS ARE CLOSE RIGHT ON US a FIGURES SHADOW
moves over Glass Glass just keeps staring straight ahead

And then the Figure sits down beside Glass and we see its a
BOY THE BOY FROM THE BED GLASS SON

Glass looks at the Boy smiles

The Boy returns the smile then reaches down runs his
small hand over the rifle

ANGLE ON THE ANSTADT

and the small hand running its finger along the outline of
that carved-out star And then Glass hand dropping into the
frame taking the small hand and holding it

CUT TO

POV FROM ACROSS THE RIVER
on Glass sitting alone on the ice holding that rifle

FADE OUT
