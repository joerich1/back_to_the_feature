Above them loom the ruins of the Stone Table overgrown with

curious Peter circles his horse around the pole

EDMUND
What is this

SUSAN
Tis’ a treeof iron

PETER
But if you look upon it there is a
lantern set atop What purpose is
this

LUCY
By likelihood it was placed here
when the trees were fewer

Peter dismounts reaching out to touch the pole

PETER
By the Lions mane it works upon
me strangely

LUCY
Tt runs in my mind also As if in a
dream

SUSAN
Or a dream of a dream

The others climb off their horses letting them graze
Edmund peers into the dark wood

EDMUND
Did anyone see in which direction
our noble prey did go

A cold wind blows

SUSAN
Perhaps it did go home Perhaps the
Great Wisdom comes innot
catching it But going where we
have soft beds and hot food wont
we then learn all the more
aboutthe comforts of home

Edmund and Lucy share an eye-roll

Just then

THE WHITE STAG bursts from the brush

scramble after it on foot into the woods

SUSAN’S HORN hangs from her saddle left behind
