distance cuts across the great desert plain and points out

We were on the radio

MOHAMMED

NEWSCASTER (VO)
Although authorities say it could
have been a foiled robbery the
American government claims they are
certain it was a terrorist attack
Minister Hassef Hazal has said that
in our country terrorist cells have
been eradicated that Morocco is a
peaceful country and that one act of
vulgar banditry followed by
superficial evaluations such as the
US intends to place upon it cannot
ruin the image the economy and the
pacifist reputation of our country
American Ambassador Ken Jones
however insists that it was a
terrorist attack on American citizens
that it merits a full investigation
and that the guilty should be
punished So far the attack has not
been attributed to any known terrorist
organizations
