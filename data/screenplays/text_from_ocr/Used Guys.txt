INT A KITCHEN - EVENING
Close on a CAKE as icing is piped onto it spelling out

“6 YEARS
HERES TO 60 MORE”

The sound of the front door GLEN good-looking thirtyish
dressed Dockers casual looks up from the cake and smiles

INT A DINING ROOM - EVENING

An elaborate dinner is spread on the table Candlelight A
single rose in a slender vase Smooth jazz plays softly

Glen places the cake on the sideboard as ANGELA a smartly
dressed businesswoman walks in She frowns at the table

ANGELA
What’s all this

Glen takes her coat and hands her a glass of wine

GLEN
Oh nothing Just a little something
I whipped up Glen‘’s famous lasagna
Some nice wine And a mocha cake
that a certain someone I know goes
crazy for

He goes and puts his arms around her--

GLEN (CONTD)
After that there’1l be some
champagne chilling by your bubble
bath And Ill be on hand to rub
your feetor whatever else needs
rubbing

Angela notices the writing on the cake and realizes--

ANGELA
It’s April 19th I totally forgot

He winks at her
GLEN
Sure you did Probably just slipped
your mind
He winks again Angela looks at him

ANGELA
Yeah It did
GLEN
So that’s probably why you didn’t
make any special plans or anything

Smiling coyly he grabs a suitcase from the hallway-

GLEN (CONTD)
So I shouldn’t have packed a bag for
any kind of tropical getaway I
shouldnt have packed anything sexy

He holds up a pair of BOXERS decorated with teddy bears
holding hearts

ANGELA
Glen we should probably talk--

GLEN
Sorry I was putting away the
laundry and I found the tickets
Looks like someone’s planning a
little fun in the sun--

ANGELA
Glen I’m not going with you

Glen stops his smile frozen on his face

GLEN
Oh I um Youre going with
someone else

ANGELA
Yes

GLEN
Awoman Female friend

Angela takes a deep breath

ANGELA
No

GLEN
Oh Okay I see Well I
understand Sometimes a woman needs
tohave experiences Experiment
Temporarily

ANGELA
It’s not temporary Glen

Glen’s frozen smile now looks panicked
ANGELA (CONT’D)
I’m sorry I was going to tell you
tomorrow It’s just--
(she sighs)
I’ve been thinking about it and with
my new job and everythingI think
I’m ready to move on

GLEN
Move on

ANGELA
Im going to try somebody new

Glen looks like he’s been hit by a truck

GLEN
ButI don’t understand Why

ANGELA
I don’t know Glen You’re a great
guy But you can be a little
emotionallyintense

GLEN
Intense

ANGELA
And you do have a few littleweird
things You know Your trips to the
bathroom at night

Glen laughs nervously--

GLEN
What are you talking about

ANGELA

Come on Glen When you live with
somebody for six years you know all
their secrets Don’t worry I’m not
gonna tell anyone

(she smiles)
There’s a woman out there And
you’re gonna be just what she’s
looking for

(trying for a joke)
Hey At least you’re already packed

INT THE BATHROOM DAY

Glen looks listlessly at his reflection as a menu of options
appears on the mirror He makes his selection--
“ROSEMARY HENNA NO MASSAGE”

A clear plastic helmet lowers down over his hair A quick
BLAST of soapy water fills the helmet A BLAST of clear
water Then a BLAST of hot air The helmet lifts up His
hair is soft and blow-dried

Glen sighs
EXT ANGELAS HOUSE — DAY

An affluent suburban neighborhood Redwood homes with solar
panels and organic curves Angela walks briskly to her hydro-
cell pod car Glen trudges after her with his duffel bag

He takes one last look at the house and notices curtains
shifting in the neighboring houses MEN look out furtively
then quickly disappear

INT ANGELAS POD CAR —- DAY

Angela’s pod car glides silently past curved graceful
buildings that blend with the natural landscape

GLEN

(quietly)
The lasagna’s in the fridge

ANGELA
Thanks Glen

GLEN
Put it on six for three minutes
Otherwise it gets all rubbery

ANGELA
Okay

GLEN
Don’t cover it ‘cause--

ANGELA
OKAY

Glen stares out the window Close on his eyes A flicker of
anger

CREDIT SEQUENCE

Close on another set of EYES Angrier Fiercer Wilder
It’s an APE

THE PRIMEVAL FOREST A family of APES The angry FATHER APE
stands in front of a MOTHER APE and her BABY preparing to
ward off a predator He looks down and sees a massive BONE
lying on the ground An idea forms in his primitive brain

A male NARRATOR speaks-—

NARRATOR (V0)
For most of human history it was
men not women who were responsible
for civilization’s greatest
achievements

The Father Ape picks up the bone and wields it like a club

A RUMBLING NOISE The Ape drops the bone and they all leap
away in terror as a BULLDOZER crashes through the jungle
splintering the trees Behind it a HIGHWAY under
construction

NARRATOR (VO) (CONTD)
it was men who created the most
efficient way to resolve disputes

By the end of the 21st Century the
world strained under the weight of
men’s achievements

Rapid-fire images of mayhem and destruction
NARRATOR (VO) (CONTD)
But men came through one more time
Providing a ray of hope to a troubled
world--

A TV ad A pickup hoops game A STUDLY GUY does a slam
dunk shattering the backboard Two ENVIOUS GUYS gasp for
air as he jumps into his Ferrari with two gorgeous BABES

STUDLY GUY
to the Envious Guys)
See you next week ladies

The Ferrari peels away

ENVIOUS GUY
How does he do it

A giant PLASTIC BOTTLE of blue liquid SLAMS down filling the
screen Its label reads—-

ANNOUNCER
MAXADE Get it up Get it on

Images of men all around the world drinking Maxade

NARRATOR (V0O)
A joint venture of the soft drink and
pharmaceutical industries Maxade
promised bigger muscles thicker
hair and longer-lasting erections
Within a year it was the best-selling
beverage in the world Maxade
delivered everything it promised
But it had one unforeseen side
effect

A morgue full of bodies lying under sheets Pup tents over
each of their groins

NARRATOR (CONT’D)
The Maxade death rate was ninety-
seven percent But guys still said
it was worth the risk

A massive cemetery Freshly dug graves Grieving women

In six years most of the world’s
male population died off The Age of
Man was over

biologists who studied bees Bee
colonies are remarkably peaceful
cooperative and stable They’re also
run by females In the lowly
honeybee the Forsters saw the
future

HELEN FORSTER peers through her bifocals and reads a speech
with the passion of an early Suffragist-

HELEN FORSTER
The only hope for mankindis
womankind

The all-female CONGRESS bursts into applause

NARRATOR (VO)
The Forster Twins founded Pacifica a
worldwide gynocracy ruled by women

A shot of the EARTH seen from space Zoom in toward what
was once California Through the clouds-

Clean green suburbs A shining CITY CENTER In the
distance lush rolling countryside stretches to the sea

NARRATOR (VO) (CONTD)
For four hundred years Pacifica
thrived A world free of war
poverty and pollution Completely at
peace

Zoom in on ANGELA’S POD CAR gliding down a manicured street

NARRATOR (VO) (CONT ’D)
As for men it looked like they
didn’t have a purpose anymore They
weren’t needed for hunting They
weren’t needed for wars They
werent even needed for reproduction--
genetic technology allowed women to
reproduce without using sperm But
the Founding Mothers realized that
men could still be useful So they
came up with a unique solution

Angela’s pod car drives into a parking lot Looming above a
sign reads “MANCO”

INT MANCO — DAY

A massive dealership full of all different kinds of CLONES
Glen stands on the gleaming showroom floor staring up at the

David why don’t you tell her a
little about yourself

The DAVID stands up Physically perfect His tailoring
impeccable His hair charmingly tousled He flashes a
thousand-watt smile Glen shoots him a dirty look

She laughs delightedly

DAVID
(an impish smile)

me

Fiddling absently with a POLO MALLET Glen swings--

A CRACK The David goes down clutching his knee Angela
winces but the Saleswoman doesn’t notice

SALESWOMAN
Are you trading in your Glen

ANGELA
Yeah I bought him six years ago
He’s good as new

She hands the Saleswoman Glen’s paperwork and a blue KEY

SALESWOMAN
I probably can’t get you a lot for
him Frankly the only people buying
Glens anymore are old ladies who want
them for housekeeping Were selling
them for half price just to get them
off the floor Women just want more
excitement these days

She signals to a SERVICE-WOMAN in a jumpsuit

SALESWOMAN (CONT’D)
You are gonna love your new David

Angela casts a quick glance at Glen as the Saleswoman leads
her away Glen meets her eyes Silently begging for a
reprieve She turns away The Service-Woman comes over-

topsyturvy

A GRAY-HATRED GLEN and an ELDERLY WOMAN sit by a roaring
fire She puts her arm around him-

with the same placid expression Then we see our Glen His

INT MANCO PREP ROOM - DAY

A DEER sips peacefully from a clear stream completely
unafraid of the nearby humans

INT A GROCERY STORE — DAY

An ultra-bright spotless grocery store stocked with organic
produce Glen pushes a shopping cart Jake walks alongside

GLEN

--80 she said “It’s time to go to
bed” So I went to the couch But
then I thought maybe she means it’s
time to go to bed So I put on my
special underwear But I think she
thought that I had actually gone to
bed So that’s when I walked in on
her And basically the whole thing
went downhill from there

Jake gives him a “What the hell’s wrong with you” look

GLEN (CONTD)
I dont know Maybe its just me
Maybe she doesn’t think it was such a
disaster

JAKE
No she does JI heard her telling

GLEN
Where are we going

They stop in front of a MOUND of earth covered in leaves
JAKE
A private refuge that holds the
ancient secrets of manhood
He reaches out and we see--

The mound is really a camouflaged TARP Jake whips it aside--

JAKE (CONTD)
Behold

A shaft of sunlight pierces the forest canopy illuminating a
oncemighty GMC VAN circa 1981 An airbrushed mural of an
Indian brave on horseback graces its flank

Reverently Jake throws open the back doors Stained shag
carpet Jumper cables A skull bong

JAKE (CONTD)
This ancient chariot probably
belonged to some sort of high priest
back in the Age of Man

He climbs in

GLEN
It smells weird

JAKE
Get in here

INT THE VAN DAY
Glen and Jake are hunched up in the back of the van--

JAKE
Four hundred years ago guys didn’t
worry about sex Why ‘Cause they
knew what they were doing And they
recorded their knowledge in a sacred
text Read it Learn from it And
I promise your worries will be over

He reaches under the seat and hands Glen the sacred text-

It’s a worn and faded PENTHOUSE MAGAZINE Reverently Glen
opens it His eyes go wide-

GLEN
Whoah

EXT THE PARK — LATER
Glen and Jake step out of the woods
JAKE
The sacred knowledge is yours now
Use it wisely

Glen nods

looking It lands perfectly in a recycling bin

MICHELLE

Glen gives an insinuating smile--

GLEN

She eyes him uneasily

GLEN (CONTD)
Do you like your pizza hot Michelle

MICHELLE
Um Yeah

GLEN

MS CONNOR (CONTD)

Michelle weve discovered a defect
in your Glen

MICHELLE
Yeah I know He has facial hair

Ms Connor and Holiday exchange a look

MS CONNOR
Im afraid it’s a little more serious
than that

HOLIDAY

We genetically modify all our clones
Take away bad thingsheart disease
body odor aggression And we
increase good things--sexual
performance obedience loyalty

MS CONNOR
But when the cloning process was
first developed the Founding Mothers
realized there was a flaw in the
system At some point—-and nobody
could say when--the process would
fail completely And a man would
come along who didn’t have any
modifications Hed revert to his
original state

MICHELLE
What are you saying

MS CONNOR
For all intents and purposes Glen
isa natural man

Michelle stares at them flabbergasted--

MICHELLE
Howhow do you know

HOLIDAY
MedLabs got a strange reading from
your health scanner yesterday

Dr Gant wheels a SCREEN of flexible polymer in front of
Michelles abdomen Light flickers and an image appears-

Suspended in Michelle’s abdomen a tiny glowing SPECK

MICHELLE
What is that

MS CONNOR
There’s a baby growing inside you
Michelle

MICHELLE

A STEVE in a cowboy hat gallops by on horseback A bunch of
GUYS laugh heartily around a massive grill

A ‘69 Firebird rumbles by Lynyrd Skynyrd blaring from the
speakers A LARRY is driving a can of beer in his hand

Beyond the strip rolling prairies give way to majestic
mountains God’s country After a lifetime of Pacifica
it’s incredible Glen and Jake look around amazed-

army honchos tested the megabomb
here Had a little more pop than
they anticipated Now the whole
place is a no-woman’s land They’re
afraid to come here because of all
the “radioactivity”

(in a high-pitched voice)
Ooh Nuclear radiation I’m so
scared

Carl and Linus crack up Glen and Jake follow Carl and Linus
down Main Street

drunken signal they start BLASTING away at cans of gasoline
scattered around the range The cans EXPLODE

swaying drunkenly as he and Linus face off Linus tags him
in the face once twice Some primal switch gets flipped in
Glen‘s brain He hauls off--

And SMASHES Linus in the jaw Linus goes down Glen stands
there eyes blazing as the crowd goes nuts Jake jumps into
the ring pumping his fist--

JAKE
Yeah YEAH

Glen decks Jake in the face Jake goes down Glen raises
his hands in the air and ROARS at the crowd--

Carl swallows his mouth suddenly dry
CARL
Umwell no I think you just need

in front of Glen

JAKE

starts to roll forward

The Mustang tips over the edge and careens down the hill
toward them gathering speed It bounces off a boulder

MEDICAL ASSSISTANT (CONTD)
Come on Get back in line with the
others It’s not gonna hurt

Glen glances helplessly at Jake and Michelle still hidden
He steps out and looks around in astonishment --—

A HUNDRED GLENS fill the vast chamber The Medical Assistant
guides Glen gently into line

Ms Connor and Dr Gant stand on a platform nearby

The Glens file into a sunken AMPHITHEATER and sit facing a
huge plasma screen Glen sits down nervously and leans over
to a GLEN wearing a sweater (call him SWEATER GLEN ) --

GLEN
What’s going on

SWEATER GLEN
It’s a sperm test They think one of
us might be the Rogue Glen

Suddenly padded harnesses clamp down over their chests
Glen looks down in alarm as a SUCTION DEVICE rises up between
his legs He looks to his left-

Another Glen (call him BALL-LESS GLEN) sits there placidly
reading Plato’s Republic No harness No suction device

GLEN
Why doesn’t he have to do it

SWEATER GLEN
They already cut off his balls

GLEN
What

SWEATER GLEN
It was a mistake The machine gave a
false positive

GLEN
Thats terrible

BALLLESS GLEN
Terrible Or the most wonderful
thing that ever happened to me

He closes his book and smiles placidly--

BALL-LESS GLEN (CONT’D)
Did you know that the average male
thinks about sex twenty-five times
every hour Not me I’m finally
free Free to concentrate on the
higher things in life Truth
Beauty The nature of existence

He smiles Glen and Sweater Glen stare at him in horror

SWEATER GLEN
(whispering to Glen)
You just have to hope that little red
light doesn’t go off

Glen looks down at the RED LIGHT on the suction device
between his legs

Suddenly the lights dim SEXY MUSIC kicks in

SWEATER GLEN (CONT’D)
Here we go

On the huge screen WOMEN IN BIKINIS wash a car The Glens
stare transfixed A faint HUM-

Glen stares in terror as the suction device glides toward his
crotch He looks at the screen--

SEXY LADIES jump on trampolines Have pillow fights Suck
Lollipops-—-

GLEN
(muttering furiously)
Not sexy not sexy not sexy--

SWEATER GLEN
Resistance is useless You gotta
just go with it

The suction device snakes inside Glens pants--

GLEN
Oh boy

A faint SUCTION SOUND Glen’‘s eyes cross slightly--

On the screen a SEXY SCHOOLTEACHER stands by a desk She
vaises a RULER in the air The Glens tense in anticipation--

She SLAPS the ruler down The Glens all climax at once with
the funny Glen YELP Glen’s face contorts trying to hold
back But he can’t He climaxes too also with the YELP

The screen goes dark A beat
Glen’s red light BLINKS on He winces--

DR GANT
We have a positive

Balli-less Glen gives Glen the thumbs-up Two MEDICAL
ASSISTANTS hustle him over to the platform

Ms Connor appraises Glen-

MS CONNOR
So youre the one the Founding
Mothers warned us about A real man
Somehow I expected more of
abarbarian

GLEN
What makes you think men are
barbarians

Suddenly Jake steps out wild-eyed waving his crossbow
Hes gone Apocalypse Now surgical tubing tied around his
forehead--

JAKE
Back off fuckos I got a crossbow

MS CONNOR
What’s going on
(seeing Michelle)
Michelle what are you doing here

Jake looks cockily at Ms Connor--

JAKE
You had a pretty good plan And it
almost worked too But you forgot
about one thing The Jake Factor

MS CONNOR
You cant stop us all with one arrow

Jake looks around desperately at the MEDICAL ASSISTANTS--
Then aims the crossbow at Glen’s crotch
JAKE
One move and the Sperm King gets it
right in the crown jewels

GLEN
What

Everybody stares at Jake confused

MS CONNOR
It seems like a painful way to do it
But okay

JAKE

(realizing his mistake)
Everybody hold on I gotta think

A TWANG as Jake accidentally pulls the trigger--
A THUNK The entire room winces

JAKE (CONTD)
Oops

Glen looks down--
His crotch is pinned to the wall He stares aghast-—-

Then pulls the arrow out Theres a hole straight through
his pants but the boys are intact

GLEN
What the hell’s wrong with you

Suddenly the doors burst open--

Holiday steps in The QC Inspectors right behind her They
surround Glen aiming their glob guns at him

Unnoticed Susanna Meadows and her Camerawoman slip onto an
OBSERVATION DECK overlooking the room Susanna gestures to
the Camerawoman to start filming

HOLIDAY
It’s over Glen You’ve been
recalled

Glen looks around There’s no way out

GLEN
Listen I’m not gonna hurt anybody
I just want to be with Michelle

MS CONNOR
Glen you know we can’t allow that

GLEN
Why not I love her

Michelle looks at him amazed

GLEN (CONTD)
Nobody messed with my genes to make
me love her I just do I love
everything about her The way her
hair smells The way she sniffles
when she sleeps Her bad singing

MICHELLE
My bad singing

GLEN
I’m saying I love it

MICHELLE
Unbelievable

He takes her by the shoulders--

GLEN
Michelle I love you

Michelle stops She looks at him her eyes shining Claire
blinks back tears The Glens look at Glen and Michelle the
embodiment of the dream they didn’t even know they had

On the Observation Deck above Susanna Meadows whispers to
her Camerawoman--

SUSANNA MEADOWS
This is great television

MS CONNOR
Glen your whole existence was a
mistake
Suddenly Michelle realizes-—-

MICHELLE
What if it wasn’t a mistake
109

Everybody looks at her

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
What if the Founding Mothers were
smarter than we thought What if
they did it on purpose To give us a
chance to decide for ourselves

On TV screens all around Pacifica the question hangs in the
air Women and their Men watch transfixed

Ms Connor looks at Michelle suddenly less certain

MS CONNOR
You won’t live happily ever after
Michelle Men and women will always
be at war

MICHELLE
I know But if we have no one to
fight with we’re all gonna die of
boredom

Michelle steps between Glen and Holiday--

MICHELLE (CONT’D)
You can have his balls when you pry
them from my cold dead hands

Glen frowns

An urgent stirring among the Glens Suddenly Ball-less Glen
stands up--

BALL-LESS GLEN
(chanting)
Riot Riot Riot

The Glens get hesitantly to their feet--

GLENS
(meekly)
Riot Riot Riot

BALL-LESS GLEN
Don’t just say it Do it

The Glens start rioting Glen style They run around
timidly letting out half-hearted yells shaking tables and
gently picking up chairs and putting them on their sides

BALL-LESS GLEN (CONT’D)
No You have to actually break
stuff

The Glens nod-—

AND START TRASHING THE PLACE QC Inspectors duck for cover
as chairs fly and scientific equipment SHATTERS They fire
their glob guns covering several Glens in sticky blue goo
Claire grabs a glob gun from a QC INSPECTOR--

CLAIRE
Excuse me I need to borrow this

She fires sticking the QC Inspector’s feet to the floor

CLAIRE (CONTD)
Thank you so much

She hands the glob gun to Jake--

CLAIRE (CONTD)
There’s a helicopter on the roof

She kisses him on the cheek

CLAIRE (CONT’‘D)
Good luck

Glen Jake and Michelle head for the door Holiday cant get
a clear shot through the rioting Glens She turns to Ms
Connor--

HOLIDAY
Lock down the room

Ms Connor reaches for a button on her control panel
Michelle turns to face her her eyes imploring Ms Connor
hesitates her finger over the button-—-
Glen Jake and Michelle race out the open door
HOLIDAY (CONTD)
(to Ms Connor)

What the hell are you doing
INT A STAIRWELL - DAY
Glen Jake and Michelle race toward the roof Jake turns to
fire a few rounds from his glob gun at the OC Inspectors hot

JAKE

Ill be okay I’ve been in way worse
scrapes than this

GLEN
Jake-

JAKE

care of ‘em

Glen falls silent Jake looks him right in the eye-

JAKE (CONT’D)
Tell your kid about me

They look at each other Nothing needs to be said Then
Glen turns and heads for the helicopter

INT THE HELICOPTER - DAY

Glen and Michelle jump in They both start jabbing at the
touch screen trying to figure out the controls-—-

MICHELLE
No It’s all automatic--
GLEN
I know I’m trying to--
MICHELLE
Youre doing it wrong--
GLEN
Honey Just let me figure this out

Okay
Michelle pokes one of the controls The rotors start up

GLEN (CONTD)
Fine You drive

From the roof Jake shouts—

JAKE
And if you see Kelly ask her if this
is how a self-centered person would
act ‘Cause I‘d be very interested
to hear what she has to say

EXT THE ROOF - DAY

Holiday bursts onto the roof with the QC Inspectors They
look up to see--

Jake facing them with his glob gun They freeze

Susanna Meadows and her Camerawoman slip onto the roof behind
the QC Inspectors The NEWS CAMERA rolls--

ALL AROUND PACIFICA people watch the face-off white
knuckled

Jake stands at the edge of the roof The interior atrium
five hundred feet below He stares coolly at Holiday a
slight smirk on his lips

JAKE
I know what youre thinking Did he
fire six shots or only five Well to
tell the truth in all this
excitement I kinda lost track
myself So you gotta ask yourselves
one question Do I feel lucky

Holiday tenses

JAKE (CONTD)
Go ahead Make my day

Holiday makes a move Jake pulls the trigger--
An ineffectual squirt of blue goo drips from the gun

JAKE (CONTD)
Guess it was six

Behind him the helicopter lifts off

HOLIDAY
Damn it

The QC Inspectors watch as the helicopter soars into the air
Jake smiles

ALL AROUND PACIFICA Women and Men watch the helicopter lift
into the air--
The emotions come pouring out Women leap to their feet
cheering Men and Women embrace

ON THE ROOF a QC INSPECTOR peers at the helicopter through
the sights of her glob gun

QC INSPECTOR
If I take out the rear rotor I can
force an emergency landing

HOLIDAY
Do it

Jake watches the QC Inspector take aim She fires--

And Jake dives He takes the GLOB right in the chest The
force of it knocks him backward--

Over the edge of the roof
INT THE HELICOPTER DAY
Glen looks down to see Jake tumble over the edge--

GLEN
Jake

INT DEPARTMENT OF REPRODUCTION - DAY

Jake plummets in slow-mo through the interior atrium of the
egg-shaped building He looks around--

Hundreds of WOMEN stare open-mouthed pressed against the
glass of their office windows watching him fall He gives a
little smile He’s going out in a blaze of glory after all
Then he’s gone

INT THE HELICOPTER — DAY

Glen turns away blinking back tears as the helicopter soars
off into the setting sun

balanced on her boots She puts down her beer--

Ext GLENDALE - DAY

Glen strolls down the road carrying his BABY in a homemade
Baby Bjorn

Glendale is high in the mountains Glen once admired from
Mantopia Wildflowers Simple cabins A MAN and a PREGNANT
WOMAN work together in their garden On a front porch
Claire bickers with a LARRY about how to hang a bird feeder
Two DAVIDS walk by arm in arm They wave to Glen

The pod bus pulls to a stop Umberto lends a hand as MEN and
WOMEN climb off

UMBERTO
Welcome everybody Don’t a-leave

Suddenly Glen stares in disbelief--

A JAKE steps off the bus and looks around

GLEN

(he gestures to Glen)
This guy’s a legend

Michelle gives an ironic smirk

MICHELLE

JAKE 950
So Michelle what do you do

MICHELLE

be impregnated

Glen sighs exhausted Jake 950 can’t believe his ears--

JAKE 950
(to Michelle)
You’re okay with that

MICHELLE
It took some getting used to but
Glen’s the only guy who can do it

She takes Baby Jake into the kitchen Jake 950 turns to

Glen incredulous--

JAKE 950
Bro that is the sweetest deal I’ve
ever heard of

GLEN
Actually it’s not as great as it
sounds-

JAKE 950

myself now Society needs me

Michelle rolls her eyes Glen shakes his head
EXT GLENDALE - DAY
Glen Jake 950 and Michelle walk out of the cabin

Close on Baby Jake in Michelle’s arms And the Narrator from
the beginning comes back--

NARRATOR (VO)
So that’s the story of how my parents
met I guess you could say they
started a revolution Ten years
later men got the same rights as
women all over the world Except in
Mantopia which continued to be ruled
by a woman I wish I could say my
folks lived happily ever after--

We rise up into the air over Glendale
NARRATOR (VO) (CONTD)
But it wasn’t that simple They
didn’t always get along and I spent
a lot of time in therapy working it
all out But they got a lot right
They taught me that men and women are
never gonna understand each other
and that’s okay They taught me that
love is a mess but it’s the best you
can hope for And they taught me
never to ask what goes on in the
Barn

EXT A BARN GLENDALE — DAY
SEXY MUSIC shakes the walls of the barn
INT THE BARN -— DAY

Glen and Jake 950 sit in padded chairs suction devices
between their legs On a screen SEXY WOMEN jump on
trampolines

GLEN
Not exactly what you had in mind is
it

JAKE 950
Nope

The suction devices move forward A SLURPING SOUND
JAKE 950 (CONTD)
But it’s still pretty god damned
good

Glen and Jake tense as the SEXY SCHOOLTEACHER raises her
ruler As she SLAPS it down--
