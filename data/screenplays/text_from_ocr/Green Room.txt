FADE-IN

INT CONVERSION VAN - DAWN 1
LOCAL RADIO quietly rattles through blown speakers

Four YOUNG MEN lie contorted within sound asleep

A muted sunbeam cuts through their hanging breath and finds
PAT (20s a doe-eyed vandal) in the rear cargo hold

He blinks awake and sits up grasping for equilibrium

He turns and wipes the fogged porthole window behind him

THROUGH THE PORTHOLE

BATTERED GREEN STALKS tight against the glass

TIGER (CONT’D)

with white stenciled ‘COWCATCHER’ logos and two GIRLS

TIGER (CONT’D)

Making his way across the half-stunned pit Werm glances up
at the stage amused

Behind him EMILY (20s) with a Chelsea hairdo crosses paths
with Daniel who discreetly passes her a FOLDED NAPKIN and
disappears into the crowd

Her eyes meet Pat’s and he is struck She flips him off
AMBER (20s) lights a cigarette steering her back on course

TIGER (CONT’D)
Ten guys jump one what a man
You fight each other the police state
wins
Stab your backs when you trash our halls
Trash a bank if youve got real balls

A bottle SMASHES on stage Sam and Pat share nervous smiles
Tiger flubs some lyrics Reece drums too fast to notice

TIGER (CONT’D)
You still think swastikas look cool
The real Nazis run your schools
Theyre coaches businessmen and cops
In a real fourth reich youll be the
first to go

Pat searches for the Emily but Werm’s pack is gone
He finds Daniel arms crossed at the exit watching him
Pat joins Sam off-mic for the chorus

TIGER SAM PAT

shrugging acceptance Sam and Pat TUNE DOWN their guitars
and the tone goes evil

POP PAT HITS DARCY IN THE EYEBROW THE SMALL CALIBER ENTRY
WOUND EJECTS A STEADY ARC OF BLOOD

DARCY FIRES the 454 RUGER BOOM IT’S A CANON

The Presa BARKS on the run-line Darcy slumps to the ground
as Amber and Pat approach guns raised

They watch him fade lower their weapons

EXT THE RESIDENCE - DRIVEWAY - MORNING 130

Amber and Pat are seated on the gravel heads resting against
the bumper of Clark’s truck

They see the shape

The wounded PIT (JD) BLOOD SOAKED AND GNARLY

It stalks up the driveway towards them

Amber and Pat raise their guns CLICK CLICK CLICK

All three of them on their last leg the PIT (JD) limps past
sniffs out Clark’s body and curls up next to it

The Presa Canario whimpers from its tethered line
Pat and Amber slump back quiet takes hold
The van’s RADIO barely audible

PAT
I know what it is

AMBER
(eyes ahead)
What what is

PAT
My desert island band

Two beaten half-assed warriors in the late summer breeze

AMBER
Tell somebody who gives a shit

CUT TO BLACK
