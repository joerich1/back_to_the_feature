come out of Kevins moms tummy
And we waited and waited but he
wouldnt come and we kept waiting

“OKhes not gonna come out on
his own so we got to go get him
And well

Fleury stops checks in with Miss Ross

RONALD FLEURY (CONTD)
Can I tell this story

MISS ROSS
Go for it

RONALD Fleury
So they take her and put her on a
special bed and they give her some
medicine so she doesnt feel any
pain then they take out this tiny
little knife and make a tiny little
cut right here in her tummy

The kids are mesmerized

up out of that belly And it was
him His head And I looked down at

him and screamed Kevin And he
looked down at me and screamed

The kids are howling

CUT TO
EXT AN UNKNOWN ROOFTOP - LATE DAY

A Muslim family sits together at a table under a tented-
canopy 32 year-old MAN nervously chewing on a toothpick and
his 8 and 15 year-old SONS The 8yo leans his weight into an
old MAN hunched and obscured by his grandson - this is his
Grandfather He gently rubs the Boys head with an ancient
left hand The Boy finger-paints in Arabic script right to
left getting paint on the table Read the translation There
is no God but Allah

The Grandfathers face is down obscured by his shumagh the
head-wrap worn by some Muslim men Never a clear view of his
face His 32 year old Son and eldest Grandson sit next to
them the Son talking quietly on a cell phone chewing that
toothpick eyes set on something in the distance A Security
Gate three hundred yards away the entrance to some sort of
compound The Compound looks like a walled-off subdivision
most of which we can see from this high up

The landscape is foreign Scrub desert Ten miles beyond on
the horizon the shimmer of a modern skyline Surreal
monolithic shapes made more so by the heat

Muted yells-claps-screams waft in from that Compound now
Catches the youngest Grandsons attention Eyes lift up from
his painting the yells-claps-screams are coming from a
softball game mostly visible behind the Compounds reinforced
walls that extend a mile in each direction Played on the
only stretch of green grass visible from this vantage

KINGDOM 81806 6

EXT COMPOUND MAIN ENTRANCE - LATE DAY

Sounds from the softball game much louder now just over the
walls Security perimeters two checkpoints deep before you
get to the main gate A maze of concrete Jersey-barriers to
slow all entering vehicles give machine-gun emplacements
flanking the entrance plenty of time to shred those vehicles
if need be Middle-Eastern Police platoons 500 lbs lift-
gates to dissuade any vehicle that just tries to ram through

SERGEANT HAYTHAM a lean 27 year-old Middle-Eastern
Policeman in-command of the Entrance Sweats through his

uniform A late-model Range Rover with blacked-out windows
queues up All the windows roll down just a single portly
White WOMAN behind the wheel her INFANT CHILD in a car-seat
in front Two other Uniformed Officers mirror-scan the bottom
of the Rover

A brief exchange as Haytham checks his ID

DRIVER
How are you today Sergeant

HAYTHAM
Sun is shining Wind is blowing
How bad can I be doing

DRIVER
I like that Sun is shining

A tight smile from Haytham

The other Officers are checking the inside of the Rover now
They nod to Haytham Haytham hands the ID back to her
Windows rolls up Lift-gate goes up Range Rover pulls away
navigating the zig-zag jersey barriers

INT COMPOUND - NEXT MOMENT 10

Stay with the Range Rover as it moves deeper into the
complex Think middle-class Phoenix suburb circa 1960 stucco
homes sandwiched between dormitory style apartment blocks
concrete and rock where grass should be

The Range Rover passes a tank with a caged SOLDIER on top
sitting behind a fifty caliber GUN A Police Land Cruiser
parked in the middle of the road is the last of the security
Official markings emergency lights in the grill

EXT UNKNOWN ROOFTOP - SAME MOMENT 11

The Son studies the compound through binoculars while the
youngest Grandson squints to study the softball game
Interest cut with jealousy More muted cheers float Behind
and above him his Grandfathers voice rough as sand to his
32 year-old Son in Arabic

GRANDFATHER (0C)

Hang up the phone If theyre not
ready now no words will change it

EXT COMPOUND SOFTBALL DIAMOND - NEXT MOMENT 12

Another Middle-Eastern POLICEMAN takes in the motley
competition half-smiling half-smirking at a plump-pink
White Man cheering on his plump-pink 9 year-old Son sliding
into third

Safe Clapping and Hoots The PITCHER an older White Man in

his middle forties visibly frustrated A 25 year-old African-
American Batter steps to the plate now Pitcher turns to his

Fielders

Ready for my knuckle-curve

The Batter just stays focused as the Pitcher tosses a high-
lob Batter smacks the ball a mile high deep to left The

A 14 year-old Indian girl sprints underneath the fly-ball
sets up catches it juggles it drops it

We pick up different families on the grass nearby A young
WOMAN helps her five year old DAUGHTER untangle a yo-yo A
black COUPLE doing a crossword puzzle together the wifes
head on her husbands lap

EXT UNKNOWN ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT 13

The muted reaction to the dropped ball The whole Family

save the youngest Grandson intently focused on two Officers
walking up to that Police Land Cruiser parked in the middle
of the road well inside the compound no blinks now

The youngest still enthralled by the softball game the
cheers the running the shorts and t-shirts We see his
Grandfathers left hand stop rubbing the Boys head and move
to the Boys temple placed like a blinder so he cant see
whats about to happen In Arabic

GRANDFATHER
Dont stop watching the game

EXT INSIDE THE COMPOUND WALLS - NEXT MOMENT 14

Noises from the softball game close again Track these two
Officers on foot walking toward the Police Land Cruiser ala
shift change nonchalant but quick

INT POLICE LAND CRUISER - SAME MOMENT 15

The Driver eyeing the two approaching Officers something off
about them Uniforms wrinkled one with a full beard Driver
turns to his Partner in Arabic

DRIVER
You have a copy of the duty rost-

-POP-POP-POP before the Driver finishes The Officers on foot
rapid-firing 9MM pistols The Driver and Passenger hit
multiple times instantly crumble lifeless in their seats
before anyone has time to process the sounds link them to an
attack The two firing ‘Officers move low-fast like
professionals rip the fresh bodies from the Cruiser jump
in The new Passenger rips an AR-15 rifle off the center
console The new Driver lays rubber into the Compound

EXT UNKNOWN ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT 16

The youngest Grandson wide-eyed startled watches as every
member of the Security Details in and around the Compound go
prairie dog search with necks extended eyes wide -- what
the fuck was that The Boy tries to turn his head away from
the game to look for himself Grandfather just pushes his
head back to the game voice harder now in Arabic

GRANDFATHER (0C)
I said keep watching the game

EXT COMPOUND MAIN ENTRANCE - SAME MOMENT 17

Haytham instantly sprints toward another nearby Police Land
Cruiser as most everyone else ducks In Arabic

SERGEANT HAYTHAM
LOCK DOWN

Then points at the Officer in the Drivers seat

SERGEANT HAYTHAM (CONTD)
MOVE

EXT COMPOUND SOFTBALL DIAMOND - SAME MOMENT 18

Game forgotten Parents up screaming for loved ones moving
fast toward the parking lot The Middle-Eastern Officer that
has been watching the game hustles onto the field next to
the Pitcher waves people toward him Gathering but sporadic
gun-fire in very near distance

WATCHING OFFICER
(accented English)
COME TO ME FOLLOW ME

People immediately flocking around the authority figure
CUT TO

The 14 year-old Indian Girl running in more puzzled than
scared why is that Cop wearing a jacket in this heat

BACK TO

The Officer rips a yellow gun-shape from his jacket pocket
The Pitcher sees it instinctively tries to rip it away from
him Gets a handful of collar pulls as violently as he can
shreds the front of the Officers coat a white linen vest
with a bulge in-front underneath the jacket

EXT UNKNOWN ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT 19

The youngest grandsons wide-eyed face Then we see the
Grandfathers right-hand slide down the other side of his
youngest Grandsons face coming to rest on his other temple

making sure hes still watching the Softball diamond now The
Grandfathers right hand missing an index and middle finger

KINGDOM 81806 10

EXT COMPOUND SOFTBALL DIAMOND - SAME MOMENT 20

Panic The Officer swings the yellow gun-shape what we now
realize is an electric drill crudely modified into something
else bashes the Pitchers face with it Those that had
gathered have turned are sprint-stumbling away

The Officer closes his eyes depresses the drill trigger

vanishes before we comprehend the massive release of blue-
black chaos expanding in an ever-wider sphere Immediate

surroundings dissolve players parents stands cars the
light standards surrounding the field and parking lot

EXT CINDER-BLOCK CONCESSION STAND - SAME MOMENT 21

Located behind straight-a-way center field at the nexus of
four fields We see it from profile as shock-wave and
shrapnel blast the structure another Officer hiding behind
it staggers out now sprawls ugly balance fucked from a
blown inner-ear He also wears a jacket and holds a modified
yellow plastic power drill Moves uneasy toward screams in
the nearby parking lot

EXT SOFTBALL DIAMOND PARKING LOT - NEXT MOMENT 22

The off-balance Officer stops over a 30 year-old African-
American woman pinned under a Toyota She hyperventilates
her bare leg and open-toed sandal kick at air The Officers
breathing calms the sight of exposed skin as divine
reassurance CLOSE-UP the vented rear of the drill as the
144 volt motor sparks blue A second blue-black explosion
that shreds the parking lot as cars smash into one another
desperate to escape

EXT ADJACENT STREET - NEXT MOMENT 23

Panicked women walking dogs Frozen A Police Land Cruiser
with bullet-scarred windows roars around the corner Stops
near the women They smile cavalry to the rescue Then a man
with leans out the window with an AR-15 point-blank
staccato Tracers exit bodies drill asphalt The Land

Cruiser rolls spraying passing homes indiscriminate

INT JACKED LAND CRUISER - NEXT MOMENT 24

Tearing through the streets Passenger firing at all signs of
life Sits back for a lightning-quick re-load Leans back out
-- before he can begin firing again-

KINGDOM 81806 11

EXT COMPOUND STREET - SAME MOMENT 25

-another Police Land Cruiser from nowhere hammers their
Drivers side Vicious The Passenger is launched out his
window head-first into the curb Both vehicles smoke-
screech Momentary pause after the a massive collision

Then Sergeant Haytham 9MM in-hand falls from the Second
Land Cruiser Stalks bloody to the Passenger side of the
jacked Land Cruiser still slowly rolling backwards leaking
all its vital fluids its snapped drive-shaft leaving a
groove in the pavement And Sergeant Haytham empties his clip
into the interior while walking along side

The Officer Haytham told to move rips himself from the
Passengers side of their vehicle bleeding profusely
screaming something unintelligible into his handheld radio
EXT UNKNOWN ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT 26
Just the youngest Grandsons horrified eyes he had no choice
but to see it all carnage painted permanently His face
still held tight between his Grandfathers hands In Arabic

From the craters looks like they
used a High Explosive possibly
military grade cant fit that much
TNT into a vest 20 30 pounds of
PETN they got it Semtex or C-4
they could get it The third there
God knowsthat crater looks like
a plane dropped a 500-pounder

RONALD FLEURY
Obviously a secondary blast after
the initial devices used to lure
first responders to the scene
Dont know anything about where or
what it was yet

GRANT SYKES
This is how they do it

ADAM LEAVITT 34 years-old sought-after Investigator
Theres a constant intense grind to this guy a mind and
mouth incapable of quiet He paces around the room then

I already know the answer but any
chance in Hell we get to go over
there use our hands

RONALD FLEURY
If you already know the answer
Adam why ask the question

stops drawing

SYKES
Were not seeing this kind of
planning and execution anywhere
elsethese aint hot-wired
artillery shells waiting for
Humvees to roll by

(pointing at the screens)
These hits are coordinated
planning timing and big broad-
daylight balls-

JANET MAYES

Yeah So did they all happen
during daylight

Another great question Fleury looks over to AGENT 1 on his
immediate right an egg-head type with a big binder in front
of him Everyones eyes follow Agent 1 flips quickly
through the binder back-and-forth searching Fleury crosses
his name off of his roster Then

AGENT 1
Yes At least the first parts of
the attacks

Everyone smells it thats big -- more proof these attacks
are being carried out by one very skilled Terror Cell

JANET MAYES
We had two othersNorth of Riyadh
and the oil thing What was that

ADAM LEAVITT

Yeah south of Jeddah Same thing

Yup

RONALD FLEURY
This is not new in concept It is
new in scope Its bigger Very
sophisticated Command and control
was flawless They found the
largest kill zone they could and
they did it they did it by being
patient

ADAM LEAVITT
Any rumors or confirmations of
uniforms being used in the other
two attacks

Fleury circles Mayes name on the ERT roster

AGENT 1
(from memory)
No I know this is the first for
that

Thats “worst case scenario’ if
youre still asking for my stab
Sir A crew who can build bombs
this big with this level of eyes-
on control and detonation

LEAVITT
Anyone take credit

Fleury checks from his notes

FLEURY
Abu Hamza Saudi Al-Qaeda Bin-
Laden-wanna-be We know he was in
Afghanistan then moved to Iraq
Now he seems to have come home
Hes clearly becoming increasingly
active

turning up the volume over there

Sykes studies Leavitt with what is best described as
substantial skepticism Fleury circles Sykes name on his
roster

JANET MAYES
They cant afford to appear as if
they are losing any kind of
control They lose control over
their country their peoplethen
they risk losing control over the
oil They wont let us in No way

Fleurys POV His open folder on the podium A memo
printed on Department of State letterhead Pulls the memo
reads it aloud calm laced with rage

RONALD FLEURY

From the State Department one hour
ago “We are in agreement with the
Saudi security assessment that any
additional American presence on
Kingdom soil represents reckless
risk Therefore it is the Secretary
of States position that only after
the situation has been evaluated
and contained should the Federal
Bureau of Investigation activate

His POV The Officer from the second Land Cruiser that rammed
the fake and killed those inside Sergeant Haytham slab-
cuffed and being worked over hard buy a couple of thick-
fisted SAUDIS Silent tears roll off his cheek left ear
split ghastly A MAN standing far right of him beats him the

distinctions blur easily Malik gives a “hold-up signal The
following exchange in Arabic

were dressed as Saudi Police We

terrorist named Abu Hamza

GIDEON YOUNG
Go on

Fleury continues

RONALD FLEURY
A Shooter crew served as
distraction After the initial
attack there was a lull to allow
Saudi Emergency Teamsand our own
attachesto collect Then a
secondary blast was triggered
aimed at those first responders So
they targeted families and rescuers
with one attack

(mildly sarcastic)

I think thats a clear signal that
their definition of “Enemy is
expanding

MARICELLA CANAVESIO

Ill go first if thats okay
Maricella
(off her ‘yeah sure nod)
First Im sorry about Fran Manner
Gideon Young remembers nods along solemnly

DIRECTOR GRACE
As we are about Rex Burr

ELLIS LEACH
I met with Prince Thamer at the
Saudi embassy fifteen minutes after
I heard this mornings news After
speaking with Thamer I advised we
withhold additional US personnel
because a big part of the religious
justification for these bombs is
the presence of current US
personnel More boots on Saudi soil
make an already combustible
situation more so I know thats
not the answer you want but

Motions to Maricella the floor is yours

MARICELLA CANAVESIO
My two cents The Saudis havent
asked for FBI help Sounds like
theyve done just the opposite If
we force the issue that could
further anger an utterly important
ally that shares a 1000-mile long
border with Iraq

GIDEON YOUNG
(to Grace and Fleury)
Its all rock-solid logic

DIRECTOR GRACE
(beat)
We would just like to be on record
as saying we think we should go
ASAP-

And please let me know if theres
anything else we can do for you

RONALD FLEURY
Sir how would you imagine it looks
viewed through an FBI agents eyes

GIDEON YOUNG
Pardon me

RONALD FLEURY
Im interested in how you think
this situation is viewed through
our eyes

the meeting isnt ending

GIDEON YOUNG
Its some variation on vengeance
When one of your own is killed
Agents lose their analytical powers
- kind of a greatest strength
greatest weakness thing

RONALD FLEURY
If I wanted vengeance Id have
whispered “Rex Burr into Elliss
ear right when we walked in
(beat)

Eyes migrate to Fleury --

RONALD FLEURY (CONTD)
This isnt Terrorism maam Its
just Serial Murder

MARICELLA CANAVESIO
Whats the distinction

KINGDOM 81806

Fleury cant keep his mouth

instantly perturbed

RONALD FLEURY
To call this massacre an act of
terrorism that implies a
specific political agenda To me
these killings are so futile and
unbalanced that they feel utterly
sociopathic- more like Charles
Manson than Osama Bin Laden

Fleury looks to Mayes She clears her throat Delivers the
following with utter precision

JANET MAYES

(beat fuck it Go)
Al Qaeda lost the first phase of
this war so a new zero-sum phase
has begun if you wont join us
well let loose the truly talented
Murderers Abu Hamza He will
kill so many of you that the
resulting humiliation of the Saudi
Royal Family will cause an exodus
a rebellion both Because the
Royal Family simply cannot protect
you or yours any longer

Fleury studies Janet with solid respect He gives Janet a
subtle nod Nice work

RONALD FLEURY
When she says talented shes not
talking about the walking-bombs who
can sneak past any and all
security nor the hi-jackers tough
enough to take an airliner Were
talking about the Man who teaches
them how

JANET MAYES

--the operational commander who
organizes trains plans
encourages That is who were
fighting

RONALD FLEURY

If we dont get inside Saudi Arabia
within 36 hours there is no chance
we catch the killer responsible for
Al-Rahmah None

KINGDOM 81806

ELLIS LEACH
Okay I believe it all So doesnt
your team in that country represent
the kind of target one of these
“Masters would die for Trade ten
of their own for one of you

RONALD FLEURY
To not engage these criminals out
of fear for our personal safety is
just another way of saying “uncle

Fleury takes another deep breath

Beat

Young stands

RONALD FLEURY (CONTD)
Ill say it another way Evidence
starts to go cold after twenty four
hours If we cant get in now we
will not find the man or men
responsible for this crime We
couldnt do it at Khobar we
couldnt do it in Yemen we have
barely scratched the surface in
Iraq And we are on verge of not
doing it here They are getting
stronger we are getting weaker I
just lost a very good friend and I

Leavitt and Grant stand back Quiet

GRANT SYKES

Hole is the case See theres
evidence down in that hole You
understand evidence Little things
that are clues Clues can be very
helpful to a fella when hes trying
to solve a crime

COLONEL AL-GHAZI
I understand that

GRANT SYKES
Glad to hear it So can we get in
there

COLONEL AL-GHAZI
No

Sykes holds Al-Ghazis gaze Smiles

GRANT SYKES
OK

Fleury is taking in the entire crime scene He notices a four
story building half a mile off the perimeter

He watches Al-Ghazi rip at a chunk of floorboard wedged into
the mud bag it himself search for someone to give it too
Nobody Sets it down Stands wipes his hands hard on his
pants Fleury could swear the dirt stains are intentional
trying to feel like hes doing something

So Sergeant Haytham speaks English

FLEURY
Were any of these shooters your
men

SERGEANT HAYTHAM
No

Fleurys thinking looking into the car Searching the
horizon he spots a distant apartment building providing a
view of the crime scene

KINGDOM 81806

FLEURY
They got into the compound
Somehowtook control of this
vehicle Im guessing they didnt
politely ask whoever was in this
car if they could take it fora
little ride

Fleury gets in the car checking out ballistic shreds in the
back of the passenger seat headrest

AL-GHAZI
No they didnt There were two
officers in the car Both were
executed

FLEURY
I understand that Those men were
your men-—

SERGEANT HAYTHAM
-- they were They were Police

FLEURY
Im sorry

Al-Ghazi offers the slightest of nods to Fleury

contact with a YOUNG SAUDI behind the 50 caliber

familiar apartment off in the distance

EXT AL-RAHMAH - SECURITY STATION CAR PARK - LATER

picks up some broken glass from the ground

FLEURY
The car was parked here

AL-GHAZI
Yes

FLEURY
Backed in

AL-GHAZI

Yes
Fleury studies the scene

FLEURY
They were attacked from the front
Must have assumed the killers were
fellow officers Have any of
these men been identified

COLONEL AL-GHAZI
Not yet We will check certain
neighborhoods It is likely that
the four men prayed at the same
Mosque

JANET MAYES
The same Mosque is enough to
identify them link them to a cell

COLONEL AL-GHAZI
Yes If the Mosque is in Suweidi

Fleury

TIA
ADAM LEAVITT
Suweidi

KINGDOM 81806

JANET MAYES
Suweidi is a known militant
stonghold Al-Qaeda could recruit
from storefronts

On Fleury he looks back at the homes then up and around

locks on the OBSERVATION BUILDING in the distance

FLEURY
Can we go to check out some of
these surrounding buildings

COLONEL AL-GHAZI
Why

FLEURY
Seems reasonable that the Planner
had to observe and based on Hamzas
past history its consistent that
he would want to video the attack
Is that true Is that accurate

COLONEL AL-GHAZI
That is true

RONALD FLEURY
Well in order to video in order
to observe you need a view

Fleury points to one particular building

FLEURY
That building sees all three crime
scenes

Al-Ghazi looks up to the building Back to Fleury

COLONEL AL-GHAZI
(beat)
Its outside the walls-

ADAM LEAVITT
-cmon now This is insane we got
enough security to invade Suweidi
let alone that building-

He

COLONEL AL-GHAZI
-no you dont

FLEURY
(to Al-Ghazi respectful)
Could you ask
(MORE)

KINGDOM 81806 77

FLEURY (CONTD)
Were already seeing the crime-
scenes individually -- why not all
at once

COLONEL AL-GHAZI
Any answer will take-

FLEURY
-time I understand

Fleury speaks slowly and clearly now like hes cementing his
words in his own head as he speaks them

FLEURY (CONTD)
You have to ask the General then
the General would ask the Prince
Does it go higher or is that is
the Prince the end of the chain

Al-Ghazi hesitates cant help but be charmed Fleury clearly
knows when to step-on or lay-off the gas Hes smooth and
HIGHLY EFFECTIVE Al-Ghazi nods ‘yes to the strange half-
question

FLEURY (CONTD)
Well be at the Community Center

The SANG Officer in-charge steps to Al-Ghazi In Arabic

SANG OFFICER
This is unacceptable

KINGDOM 81806 79

COLONEL AL-GHAZI
Its cleared with General Abdul-
Malik We have five minutes here

SPECIAL FORCES OFFICER
We were told they must remain in
the vehicles

COLONEL AL-GHAZI
That is not true

SPECIAL FORCES OFFICER
They must stay in the Toyotas-

COLONEL AL-GHAZI
-report me then when you get in-
touch with the General-

-Officer reaches down from nowhere and hammers Al-Ghazi open-
handed as Al-Ghazi tries to step past Collective shock

In that breath Haytham punishes the Officer with a left-
cross knees buckle before he comprehends what hit him
Haythams kick follows catches the Officer in the sternum as
he hits ground

Al-Ghazi shakes it out trades blows with the SANG second in-
command

Leavitt moves catches a rifle butt to the shoulder after two

steps Fleury aims drills the Soldier that butted Leavitt
instant night-night Another SANG steps up Fleury throats
him knee caps him and grabs his weapon before the dude hits
the ground

Fleury can obviously fight all the above happens in four
seconds

Then a knock-it-off gunshot aimed at the sky pops one-foot
from Janets head We hear what she hears one half-second of
the shot then the big ring On her knees immediately hand
over her ear In response heavy-caliber gunfire flies group
flinch-n-crouch The warning shots from a 50-caliber mounted

The Humvee now slides to stop ten feet from the fracas
General Abdul-Malik out of the passenger seat in Arabic

Humvees backseat break him down face first in the dirt
cuff him lock him in the vehicle

A disagreement

The General grabs the Officer by the back of his head an
abusive Dad Walks him to the side

Al-Ghazi looks back down at Janet at Leavitts bruise at
the man Fleury knocked out Angry Impressed fought
alongside him Haytham hasnt moved an inch not even when
the General came chin raised to an entire platoon say when

Look for yourself

Al-Ghazi takes the camera from Fleury He lines up the same
shots we saw posted on Leavitts computer clearly a match
This is where they shot the video

Another long moment Al-Ghazi looks at the table discarded

trash

the Capri Sun containers the candy wrappers

Formed the plan up here saw
everything he could hit

Way too pretty a plan to have been
fully hatched on just one visit He
came here a couple times

Al-Ghazi quiet for a long while Then he reciprocates

COLONEL AL-GHAZI
The man who did this is a Saudi -
this place this neighborhood if
foreigners were up here someone
would say something

Fleury looks over to the two dozen LOCALS peering out with
suspicion at them on the rooftop

FLEURY

What have you seen so far of our

When I bull-rush our hosts youll know it In his quiet calm-

kilometers from the compound you
will find a rooftop where the
attacks were planned Ive seen
that the person in this room born

protective

DAMON SCHMIDT
They arent protecting anyone
Theres no conspiracy Theyre just
terrified Finally The Saudis have
finally seen the Monsters they
helped create because those
Monsters have come home And if
Saudis dont catch Saudi Monsters
thats the end

Fleury opens his mouth to interrupt

DAMON SCHMIDT (CONTD)
(right through Fleurys
attempt to speak)
And that end could come double-
quick if they let the US Shaytan
catch those Monsters for them
(Fleury silent gets it)
Because thats what the Saudi on

keeping the Royal Family upright is
American evil

from that stacks of bagged evidence two dozen evidence
containers

Sykes clambers out of the hole streaks of re-animated mud
where sweat streams out of his hairline mad-dashing for his
chin A chunk of metal in one hand something small in the
other a marble He drops it in the appropriate cannister
then steps to a chunk of metal one half of an alternator

Sykes stares down at the pieces of completely mangled metal
He studies a piece of twisted half-melted iron Thinking

He walks over to a second larger piece of twisted metal
Starts trying to fit the two pieceslike a puzzle

hand one of the GUARDS unloads in her direction - a full
guttural Arabic assault No idea what hes saying but its
obvious hes furious Haytham starts firing back This is an
un-translated argument We sense that the guard is doing more
than expressing his displeasure regarding Janet This seems
to be personal Janets getting very nervous A frightening
display Then Haytham turns

HAYTHAM
You cannot touch any Muslims

Janet takes a breath as the Police hard-eye her

continues the translation

COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONTD)
The Man who made War on Al-Rahmah
is someone my age -- this kind of
skill is learned over decades

Talal looks at Fleury now speaking directly to him through
Al-Ghazi

COLONEL AL-GHAZI (0C) (CONTD)
A Man who can plan the mass-murder
of women and children then go home
at night to his own and sleep
soundly That kind of Man is
supremely difficult to catch

RONALD FLEURY

How does he know he slept soundly

Colonel Al-Ghazi hesitates then relays Fleurys question
Talal stares eyes touched by war-blood-atrocities committed
Someone who believes hes going to Hell

Al-Ghazi and Talal speak in Arabic about the detonator

Al-Ghazi looks to Fleury translates

COLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONTD)
He says that there are several ways
to get American military equipment
like this detonator but not many
men in Saudi Arabia that know how
to get them

FLEURY
How do they get them

COLONEL AL-GHAZI
Usually smuggled from Iraq by
corrupt soldiers working with the
Americans

Could Hamza get this equipment

Al-Ghazi asks Talal

COLONEL AL-GHAZI
Without question Yes he could

Al-Ghazi steps toward the approaching crowd they see his

larger mass then the topper-

-AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE from somewhere Glass-dirt-metal bursts

Fleury looks up just the roof of an old Mercedes on the
median dirt kicked up behind them running behind lines of
stopped-wrecked traffic now The barrel of a rifle held high
out the window like a taunt Accelerating for another opening
to finish the job

Scared motorists devolve into terrified motorists Many have
abandoned their vehicles to sprint into the desert the rest
go smash-em-up derby-folly 50 panicked drivers aiming for
the same spots Fleury snatches an M4Al from the stack
dropped by Haytham up to his shoulder hustling toward the
next break in traffic The Mercedes is approaching at 80 MPH

Fleury flips a switch on the left side of the rifle just
forward of the handle full-auto Takes a deep measured
Snipers breath eases the stock snug aimpoint up to his
right eye and without hesitation lets loose the entire clip
perfectly one heartbeat before the Mercedes hits the gap
The right side of the Mercedes shreds just as it appears
Fleurys clip gone in a flash yet more rounds still hit the
Mercedes Al-Ghazi four feet away firing his own salvo from
a knee Something bright red pops against the drivers side
window now the Mercedes rip-slides to a stop Commotion
inside Wild half-aimed shots back at us
