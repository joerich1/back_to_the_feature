By the time master Geppetto made
Pinocchio he had already lost a
son

FADE IN

EXT THE HILL - DUSK

CRICKET (VO)
Now this was quite a few years
before my time but I learned the
story and then it became my
story

Some autumn leaves are blowing by

Small hill by a pine forest and RED birch trees AUTUMN A
lonely figure standing by a wooden grave marker This is
GEPPETTO Able-bodied and in his mid-seventies but sorrow
ages him A shock of white hair- matching his unruly beard-
haloing his strong noble face

He is consumed by grief He kneels by the grave brushes off
the snow

Embedded- and framed- by the wooden grave marker there is a
photograph of a beautiful boy of TEN Carlo And the
inscription on the grave reads

CARLO MY ANGEL Gone back to heaven February 1916

CRICKET (VO)
Geppetto lost Carlo during the
Great War They had been together
only ten years-
(beat)
-but it was as if Carlo had taken
the old man’s life with him

Geppetto looks at the photograph and smiles a tremulous
smile A tear rolls down his cheek

CAMERA pushes on the photograph We transition to

EXT GEPPETTO WORKSHOP - TREE (THE PAST) - DAY

Cold WINTER day CARLO swings in a tree swing Looks up at
planes passing overhead Jumps off the swing He rushes back
to the house pretending to be an airplane
CARLO
(airplane sounds)

INT GEPPETTO WORKSHOP - DAY
The workshop is a WARM wonderland of toys and marionettes

Everything is hand-carved doors furniture shelves
utensils

CARLO

GEPPETTO
Yes

CARLO

GEPPETTO

CARLO
Guess

GEPPETTO

I have no idea

CARLO
I saw some planes

GEPPETTO
Oh did you Good

Geppetto is carving a puppet Carlo tries to steal a look

CARLO
What is it you’re making this time
Papa

GEPPETTO
Guess

CARLO

A soldier A magician A witch

GEPPETTO
No no no no no no no Youll
have to wait and see Carlo All
good things require patience

-DRAG WOOD BACK TO THE HOUSE
-FEED THE FIRE TOGETHER

CRICKET (VO)
They wanted for nothing all they
needed was each other’s company

-HAVE A MODEST BUT ABUNDANT MEAL TOGETHER CROSS THEMSELVES
AND EAT

GEPPETTO
(quietly praying)

INT GEPPETTO BEDROOM - NIGHT

Carlo is in his hand-carved bed decorated with Italian fairy-
tale pictures Light snow falls outside a window

Geppetto reads Carlo a fairy tale

GEPPETTO
And the old witch warned the little
hedgehog- do not tell lies or your
nose will grow and grow- up to
here

Geppetto extends his finger out from his nose to demonstrate
it growing Carlo’s eyes sparkle still immersed in the
story

CARLO
His nose would grow

GEPPETTO

Lies my dear boy are found out
immediately because they are like
long noses- visible to all but the
teller of the lie

(beat)
And the more you lie the more it
grows

They both laugh as Geppetto encompasses Carlo in the blanket
tickling him through the fabric

CARLO
(yawns )
Sing me Mama’s song so I can sleep
please Papa

GEPPETTO
Alright
Geppetto grabs his accordion and starts playing a sweet
LULLABY

He clears his throat and then begins
GEPPETTO
(singing)
My Son My son You are my
shining Sun My moon My stars
My clear blue daylight sky

Carlo closes his eyes and what follows is a series of
vignettes over different seasons
-GEPPETTO PUSHES CARLO ON A SWING

CARLO
Higher Papa Higher

GEPPETTO (SONG) VO
And if you looked at me today my
heart would heal so fast And if

you held me right away I’d be
complete at last At last

-GEPPETTO TEACHES CARLO TO CARVE MARIONETTES

EXT BUTCHER’S SHOP
Geppetto installs a pig-doorbell on the BUTCHER’S SHOP

GEPPETTO
Try it

Carlo pulls the strings to test it out
He’s paid with sausages and HAM

GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
Thank the ladies

The BUTCHER SISTERS laugh at how excited Carlo is How cute
Geppetto walks Carlo up to the school and gives him a book

GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
For you

CARLO
(small gasp)
For me
GEPPETTO
For you Carlo

Waves goodbye to Carlo as he heads off to SCHOOL Carlo joins
happy kids

GEPPETTO (SONG) VO (CONT’D)
You are my favorite favorite
thing Better than Sunset- Better
than spring You bring me joy You
make me sing In the morning and
the evening too You are everything
to me and I love you

spread out before him Carlo flies a kite nearby giggling
with childish glee as it dances upon the wind
GEPPETTO (SONG) VO
My Son My Son You are my golden
Sun

-GEPPETTO AND CARLO CHOP DOWN A TREE

As it starts to fall Geppetto lunges forward to quickly pull
Carlo out of the way
GEPPETTO
(stuttering)
Watch out Carlo

-CARLO LOOKS FOR A PERFECT PINE CONE
GEPPETTO
(speaking)
When one life is lost another must

grow

CARLO
How about this one

Carlo shows him a scraggly-looking pine cone
GEPPETTO
(speaking)
No- no- no- no Carlo It has to be
perfect- complete See This one’s
missing some of its scales

Carlo nods examining the imperfect pine cone

Good night my son
EXT TOWN STREETS - DAY
WINTER -- February 1916

Snow still lingers around town Geppetto and Carlo go by
dragging a WOODEN CART filled with the paints and tools
Geppetto is well groomed Carlo sits on the back of the cart
proudly wearing his new brightly colored clogs

CARLO
I love my new shoes Papa
GEPPETTO
I’m very glad Carlo
CARLO
We’re going to church first right
GEPPETTO
Oh yes yes

Carlo spots a stray dog on the side of the road

CARLO
Hello there little dog

We see the town a BEAUTIFUL village with turn-of-the-century
buildings peppered amongst Medieval hamlets and workshops
The spirit of the town is LIVELY Geppetto and Carlo wave to
people as they travel through town

STREET SWEEP WOMAN

it A few people bustle about in front THE DOCTOR AND HIS
WIFE pass by and greet them

DOCTOR
Buongiorno

GEPPETTO
Buongiorno Dottore

THE TOWN PRIEST awaits Geppetto on the steps

TOWN PRIEST
Ahh Carlo Geppetto

The Priest reaches out and shakes Geppetto’s hand to welcome
him

Carlo runs ahead and sees the nearly finished Crucifix

INT CHURCH - EVENING

Geppetto still painting Carlo looks up from his SCHOOL BOOK
CARLO
It looks great Papa Is it almost
time to go home

GEPPETTO
Almost Send up a little more red
for me

CARLO looks in Geppetto’s COMPLEX TOOLPAINT BOX and passes a
paint jar using a bucket

CARLO
Oh I forgot to show you what I
found

GEPPETTO

What is it my boy

CARLO
Youll seeTa-da

Carlo has hidden a PINE CONE in the bucket

GEPPETTO
(laughing)
The PERFECT pine cone It still has
all its scales

CARLO
I thought I could plant it myself
and watch the tree grow And then
carve toys for myself- like you do

Geppetto laughs proud

GEPPETTO
I think that’s as good an idea as
any boy ever had Carlo

Geppetto tosses the pine cone down to Carlo He fumbles and
bats it around several times before safely securing it

CARLO
Isnt it

A low rumble drones above their heads

CARLO (CONT’D)
What’s that sound Papa

Geppetto listens

CARLO (CONT’D)
Is it a plane

Geppetto grows concerned but shakes it off He climbs down
the scaffold- agile- nimble

GEPPETTO
Gather the tools- quickly We’ll go
home to a warm fire and hot soup

CARLO
Can we have some hot chocolate too

GEPPETTO
(distracted)
Sure sure

CARLO
It seems like a hot chocolate sort
of daydoesn’t it

GEPPETTO
Oh yes yes yes Fa-fine

Geppetto isn’t listening His attention is on the ominous
sounds outside He heads towards the exit of the church
Carlo starts to follow him

EXT CHURCH - NIGHT

Geppetto stands at the foot of the church and looks up in the
sky

CARLO
Papa what is it

GEPPETTO
Nothing I’m sure it’s nothing
but

CARLO

Oh wait my pine cone
Carlo returns to collect his pine cone

The sky is peppered with planes going to war Bombs explode
in the distance

CRICKET (VO)
It was later said that Geppetto’s
little town was not even a target-
that these planes were heading back
to base and simply let go of their
bombs to make their ballast
lighter

One of the planes- THE BIGGEST ONE-
-Releases 3 large bombs
THE BOMBS FALL- whistling-
-heading for the ground-
GEPPETTO
(gasps)
Carlo
Geppetto runs back to the church-

Inside the church Carlo finds his missing pine cone

-But it is too late The bombs hit the church and burn the
frame Debris flies everywhere

Geppetto falls to the ground His ears ringing
All he can see is fire
Something lands near him Carlo’s perfect PINE CONE

GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
No Carlo

Geppetto passes out

CAMERA TRACKS INTO THE BURNING CHURCH

CUT TO

EXT THE HILL - DUSK

Geppetto plants the pine cone by Carlo’s grave and cries A
few MOURNERS keep their distance

Then they move away leaving Geppetto alone with his grief
Two men hammer the headstone into the ground

DISSOLVE TO

INT CHURCH

CRICKET (VO)
Geppetto never left his side- and
that was that He worked very
little he ate even less
(MORE )

CRICKET (VO) (CONTD)

and the Church’s crucifix remained

unfinished
-The bombed out church- the broken maimed crucifix examined
by the angry Town Priest He begins to pray
EXT THE HILL
-Geppetto in the WINTER cleaning Carlo’s grave
-Geppetto in the SPRING laying flowers on the grave

-Geppetto in the SUMMER telling stories with puppets

-Geppetto in the FALL singing a song with his accordion

INT GEPPETTO WORKSHOP - THE YEARS PASS

CRICKET
The years passed the world moved
on but Geppetto did not

Geppetto DRINKS alone in his cold lifeless bedroom He
stares at Carlo’s old SCHOOL BOOK and a few other mementos
He passes out asleep

FADE OUT

FADE IN

EXT THE HILL - SUNSET
SPRING -- Saturday APRIL 9 1939
A PINE TREE has grown out of Carlo’s grave Storm clouds

CRICKET (VO)
And this is where I come in

CAMERA discovers SEBASTIAN J CRICKET A somewhat elegant
cricket but still a cricket He hops along the grass uphill-
carrying a CANVAS BAG AND A SUITCASE in one arm and a
LEATHER-BOUND VOLUME AND A KNAPSACK tucked under the other

CRICKET (VO)
Y’see I was a writer- and for years
Id been looking for the ideal
conditions to set my illustrious
fascinating life-story to paper
Until at long last I found it

The Cricket approaches the grave and looks UP-
- To a nook in the pine tree

CRICKET (VO)
My sanctuary HOME

INT NOOK - SUNSET

It begins to rain outside but the nook is spacious and dry
The Cricket examines the space- standing on its own two hind
legs- like a proud homeowner He is making it “cozy”

CRICKET (VO)
HERE I could write my memoirs And
what a tale it would be I had
lived in a barrister’s fireplace in
Sardinia sailed on the Adriatic in
a fishing boat Nested one Perugian
winter with an acclaimed sculptor

Cricket takes a portrait- places it on a knot in the nook and
then displays his inkwell and quill

He writes the title of his book
CRICKET
“Stridulations of My Youth”
By Sebastian J Cricket
Then

The Cricket looks out the nook

EXT THE HILL - SUNSET
Geppetto sprawled beside grave bottle in hand in the rain

GEPPETTO
(weeping)
I dreamed of you CarloI
dreamed you were right back here
with me My son

The Cricket watches Geppetto crying by the grave

CRICKET
Oh dear

GEPPETTO
If only I could have you back
here I’m so sorry

CRICKET (VO)
I watched the old man weep and it
moved me And it turns out that I
wasn’t the only one watching him

The Cricket looks into the woods

FROM THE WOODS
THE WINGED FIGURE watches Geppetto

CRICKET
In my many wanderings on this
earth I’ve learned that there are
old spirits living in the
mountains in the forests

The Cricket and her make eye contact
CRICKET (CONT’D)
Who rarely involve themselves in
the human world-

The GLOWING EYEBALLS fade into the bark of the trees

CRICKET (CONT’D)
But on occasion They do

GEPPETTO

I want you back Carlo- right
herewith me

GEPPETTO SLAMS HIS FIST AGAINST THE TREE
GEPPETTO
Why won’t you listen to my prayers
Why
A deluge of rain pours down from the branches
The Cricket takes one last pitiful look at furious Geppetto
as he marches away stumbling- shakes his head and goes back
inside
INT NOOK - NIGHT
Cricket sits down and starts to write again-
CRICKET

Ahh where were we Ah yes
Perugia

when--
His handwriting shakes- wavers The whole nook shakes

CRICKET (CONT’D)

Whoaaah What in my antennae-

Oooof

EXT THE HILL - NIGHT
From Cricket’s POV inside the nook we see Geppetto using an
axe to chop down the tree Lighting THUNDER
INT NOOK - SAME
The Cricket’s world SHAKES with every hack of the axe
causing him to lose balance He scrambles to keep his papers
safe
GEPPETTO (0S)
I will have him back I’1ll make

Carlo again

CRICKET
WuhhHey

GEPPETTO
Out of this accursed pine
EXT THE HILL - NIGHT
Rain pours down Wind whirls Lightning THUNDER CRACKS

Geppetto hacks the tree with an axe

INT NOOK - NIGHT

C-c-crack Tree falls Cricket goes weightless (ref Magnolia
ambulance scene)

CRICKET
ahhhahaha

It lands HARD His papers strewn all over

EXT THE HILL

Geppetto drags a piece of the trunk back towards-

EXT GEPPETTO HOUSE
-His house
CRICKET
(Gasps)
INT GEPPETTO WORKSHOP

The Cricket pops out of the tree like a submarine captain
dizzy from his journey He is inside the workshop

He follows Geppetto in his drinking binge stumbling drunk
and retrieving sharp carving instruments

SHINK A bark spud slides across surface almost decapitating
Cricket

CRICKET
What on earth Nooo

He narrowly escapes and hides in a cuckoo clock

As Cricket watches with morbid fascination camera adjusts to
reveal a TINY MAN standing right behind him Wait no it’s
just a wooden peg doll from the cuckoo clock Phew

HE almost kills the Cricket as the clock strikes the hour

CRICKET (CONT’D)
Oww Ohhh Oooh

Geppetto looks at a picture of Carlo (one ear visible in
photo) He witnesses Geppetto carve Pinocchio- furiously
Vehemently
CRICKET (CONT’D)
It’s a house of horrors
(gasps and covers his eyes)

He finishes one beautifully carved ear little curls of hair
on one side of his head He touches the ear tenderly

He cries at the sight He prays- to no one in particular

Geppetto hammers some nails Attaches a carved hand Hinges a
knee Places the head on the neck joint

We see an unfinished basic puppet sketched but crude

PINOCCHIO

GEPPETTO
I I will finish you tomorrow

Geppetto stumbles to the stairs

GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
Yes tomorrow

But passes out halfway up the steps- slides down and slumps
on the floor

A glowing eye blinks into view in front of Geppetto It
inspects him

Cricket watches curiously Another eye floats in to inspect
Cricket

CRICKET
Shoo Shoo Shoo Shoo Shoo

Cricket sees eyes are swarming all around Pinocchio

CRICKET (CONT’D)
Hey Get away from there Go away
Bugger off

Cricket jumps to Pinocchio trying to scare away the eyes

CRICKET (CONT’D)
No no no no no This is my
home No trespassing Go go go
go Get away from here Go Go
away Go away

Eyes drift away

CRICKET (CONT’D)
Yes that’s right

The eyes begin to form a FIGURE The FIGURE DISPLAYS its
wings (covered with eyes in place of feathers) and reveals
the benign face of a PALE WOOD SPRITE The face has clear
similarities to Carlo’s mother’s face but is simplified and
statuesque

CRICKET (CONT’D)
Now what

The Cricket watches as the Pale Figure approaches Pinocchio
CRICKET (CONT’D)

(in awe)
Whoa

WOOD SPRITE
Little wooden boy May you rise
with the sun and walk the earth

CRICKET
Excuse me- Can I help you

Unnervingly the FIGURE half turns ALL EYES ON THE CRICKET
WINGS FLUTTERING

CRICKET (CONT’D)
This is my home we’re talking
about

He hops towards the Wood Sprite

CRICKET (CONT’D)
(harrumphs )
May I ask- Who on earth are you

WOOD SPRITE
On Earth A Guardian I care for
the little things the forgotten
things- the lost ones

CRICKET
Well I am Sebastian J Cricket
HOMEOWNER And I have every right
to be consulted about your schemes
and machinations regarding my
property

WOOD SPRITE
Well since you already live in the
heart of the wooden boy perhaps
you can help me

CRICKET
Help you what

WOOD SPRITE
To watch over him guide him to be
good

CRICKET
I’m not a governess madam I am a
novelist- a raconteur- currently
immersed in writing my memoirs

WOOD SPRITE
Well in this world you get what
you give Take on this
responsibility and I will grant
you one wish

CRICKET
And that could be anything
Anything at all

Cricket scratches his antenna with his hind leg

CRICKET (CONT’D)
The publication of my book Fame
Fortune

WOOD SPRITE
Anything

Cricket looks to Pinocchio who lays in the corner half in
shadow limbs akimbo

CRICKET
Hmm maybe I CAN help I’1ll try my
best and that’s the best anyone can

do

(beat)
Hehe that’s rather clever isn’t
it

Cricket turns back to Wood Sprite who touches the puppet
with her GLOWING RIGHT HAND

WOOD SPRITE
Little wooden boy Made of pine- We
shall call you Pinocchio- may you
rise with the sun and wander the
earth and bring joy and company to
that poor heartbroken man- be his
son- fill his days with light- so
he’1l never be alone

The Cricket is perched on Pinocchio’s nose ZAPPP He is
electrocuted by the Wood Sprite’s magic He falls to the
table

She then fades away

The light fades away as well

INT FIREPLACE - MORNING

Geppetto wakes up at the bottom of the stairs Through the
fog of sleep we hear faint footsteps and clattering

He looks around hungover but curious of the sounds

He notices The Puppet is gone

He notices The picture of Carlo knocked over and covered in
wood shavings

He looks under the workshop table Nothing

He hears more noise Reacts quickly and bumps his head on the
table

Clattering It’s coming from above A ladder leads to an
attic crawlspace over the workshop

GEPPETTO
Who goes there

Geppetto grabs an AXE from the ground and moves cautiously
GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
II’m warning you II have a

weapon

He climbs the ladder and enters the attic

INT ATTIC - MORNING

Suspenseful horror movie sequence Geppetto pops his head
into the dim attic

In the dark corner is a strange unnatural writhing-and-
rattling THING Geppetto approaches trepidatiously As his
eyes adjust he sees there is something ALIVE in the attic

The THING steps into the light like Frankenstein revealing
its grotesquely lit face it is PINOCCHIO

PINOCCHIO
Good morning Papa

Pinocchio is alive

GEPPETTO
ARRRRRGH

Geppetto screams in absolute horror

GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
W-what is this What kind of
sorcery

PINOCCHIO
You wanted me to live You asked
for me to live

GEPPETTO
Who- Who--are you

PINOCCHIO
My name is Pinocchio I’m your son

Geppetto frantically holds the axe

GEPPETTO
You’re not my son Don’t come near
me

Sebastian J pops out of Pinocchio’s chest

CRICKET
The boy is telling the truth
Master Geppetto

GEPPETTO
Arrrgh It’s full of cockroaches

Geppetto recoils

The old man backs up in terror hitting his head on the low
ceiling tripping backwards through the crawlspace door
hitting his chin as he falls down

INT GEPPETTO WORKSHOP - MORNING

»and landing on the hard floor of the workshop The axe
tumbles from his hand

Pinocchio descends the ladder with disjointed inhuman
movements he’s not yet in full control of his body (ref a
baby’s weird twitchy movements floppy wooden puppet)

Geppetto flat on his back tries to pull himself further
away from this monstrosity

Pinocchio starts to look around the room in wonder He picks
up the axe and looks at it with curiosity

He gasps and runs off giggling as he sees something else of
interest

Having lost interest in the axe he tosses it aside Luckily
this time Geppetto is able to catch it before it strikes him

PINOCCHIO

(gasps )
WowWhat is this
Another g
bottles

Pinocchio
glee

Pinocchio

Geppetto

asp as Pinocchio sees a row of glinting empty
He rushes over

PINOCCHIO (SONG) (CONT’D)

PINOCCHIO

chases him trying to calm him- picking up after
stian stays inside the nook- holds on for dear life

GEPPETTO (SONG) (CONT ’D)

GEPPETTO (SONG)

PINOCCHIO (SONG)

Pinocchio smashes with the hammer shattering all the

bottles

GEPPETTO (SONG)
Oh no No Ugh

PINOCCHIO (SONG)
Everything is new to me
To me

GEPPETTO (SONG)
Ca-Careful

Pinocchio grabs a broom and swings it around dancing with it
like Fred Astaire

Cricket inside the nook hangs on for dear life

Pinocchio climbs up and swings from the ceiling In his
enthusiasm he knocks some knives off a shelf They come
dangerously close to stabbing Geppetto but he manages to
leap out of the way as they pierce the ground all around him

GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
Ahh sharp Sharp Ahhh

PINOCCHIO (SONG)
The world is rich with funny words
They ring like bells those tiny
words
They glow they shine they dance
in my mind
Like a chorus line those silly
words of mine
La la eee dooo

What do you call it call it

GEPPETTO (SONG)

Pinocchio begins running around again clutching the bedpan

GEPPETTO (SONG)
Oh dear oh dear Well alright
alright that’s enough That’s
enough Ohhh Don’t Don’t No No
You have to stop

PINOCCHIO (SONG)
Everything is new to me

Geppetto stares disgusted at his unholy creation
Geppetto throws a blanket over Pinocchio- yodelling

Then nervously runs and pushes Pinocchio- blanket and all-
into a closet

Closes the closet door Locks it Pinocchio BANGS loudly
trying to escape

PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
That was so much fun Papa

GEPPETTO
You’re not my son
(beat)
What is wrong with you
It’s quiet He stares at the door apprehensively

PINOCCHIO
I’m sorry

Geppetto opens the door slowly to look inside

Pinocchio sits in the corner A glove is stuck on the end of

his nose He makes for a ridiculous figure and for a moment
Geppetto’s heart begins to soften

GEPPETTO
I--uh
(searching for the words)
Just stay here- don’t come out

The CHURCH BELLS ring Backs away from the door

GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
Time for Church-

Trying to pretend like it’s a normal day he heads to front
door

PINOCCHIO
Church I wanna go to Church
Church Church Church

GEPPETTO
Stay there You- you understand

Opens the front door and closes roughly behind him
Pinocchio continues to bang on the locked closet door

PINOCCHIO
Church Church Church Church

SMASH Pinocchio BURSTS out of the closet- yelling

PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
Church

CRICKET
No no He told you to stay-

PINOCCHIO
(sing song)
I’m going to church I’m going to
church I’m going to church

Pinocchio continues to head towards the door
CRICKET
No no no Please stop you must

obey your Papa

PINOCCHIO
“Obey”

CRICKET
To do as you are told

PINOCCHIO
But I don’t want to obey
CRICKET
Well you must try your best and
that’s the best anybody can do

MUSIC SWELLS as if in the start of a musical number Cricket
sings oh ever so briefly with a perfect baritone voice

CRICKET (CONT’D)
My dear father loved to say---

Pinocchio opens the door slamming it into the Cricket
crushing him and cutting off his song

PINOCCHIO
I’m going to church I’m going to
church
Pinocchio opens the door and leaves
CRICKET
Ugggh

Geppetto is filing off the excess nose from Pinocchio
Pinocchio is fidgeting And yodeling

Cricket watches from a ledge while tuning a tiny fiddle He
waves at Pinocchio

GEPPETTO (CONT’D)

PINOCCHIO
Papa- Why did my nose grow today

GEPPETTO
You lied Pinocchio And a lie is-—
plain to see as your nose And
PINOCCHIO
And the more you lie the more it
grows Is that it
Pinocchio extends his finger out from his nose to illustrate
Geppetto is startled- how does Pinocchio know that
GEPPETTO
That- yes- that’s it-

A KNOCK on the door Geppetto goes to answer Lightning
illuminates The Town Priest and The Podesta (in Fascist
Regalia) More lightning illuminates

As Podesta I must ensure that this
“puppet” of yours poses no threat
to our community

GEPPETTO
Oh no no nothing like that

PINOCCHIO
Ooh is that--hot chocolate

The Podesta stares at Pinocchio with bewilderment

CANDLEWICK
You’re a puppet You’ve never eaten
anything in your life

PINOCCHIO

(to his guests)
He really is a charming boy

TOWN PRIEST
Podesta watches over the town’s
moral well being you understand
His authority cannot be questioned

PODESTA
That’s right- and I wont be
mocked

Pinocchio sits down puts his feet close to the fire and
proceeds to IMITATE CANDLEWICK’s EVERY GESTURE as he sips
chocolate noisily Candlewick sees this as a challenge

(As the adults talk Candlewick and Pinocchio continue their
game of “copy cat”)

GEPPETTO (0S)
I will do just as you wish You

PODESTA
So what about this wooden boy Will

CANDLEWICK

Hey try to get closer to the fire-
to get warm

PODESTA

Candlewick

GEPPETTO

Geppetto screams and grabs the puppet he dashes back and
forth around the room and finally sinks the legs into a
bucket of water

PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
Awwww look what you did Papa You

PODESTA
This is what you get with an
undisciplined mind You must send

this child to school

GEPPETTO

Cricket watches from above considering what the Podesta has
said Perhaps school would be good for the boy

It’s raining Geppetto closes the upstairs window

GEPPETTO

PINOCCHIO
(imitating)
Oh what a day What a day

GEPPETTO
Hahaha Time for bed

Geppetto lifts Pinocchio off of his bed and carries him over
to the bed that belonged to Carlo

PINOCCHIO
You know Papa I liked my old
legs And I liked them on fire

GEPPETTO
Pinocchio if you go to sleep- I1l
make you a new pair of legs in the
morning

The Cricket pops out and watches as Geppetto tucks him in

PINOCCHIO
Just like the old ones

GEPPETTO

(chuckling)
Better than the old ones
PINOCCHIO
Better Can I have cricket legs
Papa Can you make me four of them

Geppetto gets into bed

Good night Papa

GEPPETTO
Good night my--
GoodnightPinocchio

For a moment it was as if Pinocchio WAS Carlo

Pinocchio sees the Cricket

PINOCCHIO
Sebastian-

CRICKET
Yes Pinocchio

PINOCCHIO
Who’s Carlo

CRICKET
Carlo was a boy Geppetto lost him
Many years ago

PINOCCHIO
Where did he put him How can you
lose a whole person

CRICKET
I mean he he died Pinocchio
He’s no longer alive

PINOCCHIO
Is that a bad thing

CRICKET
Yes it’s a great burden for a
father to lose a child so young

PINOCCHIO
What’s a burden

CRICKET
It’s something painful you must
carry even though it hurts you
very much

Long beat as Pinocchio closes his eyes
The Cricket smiles and goes back home
CRICKET (VO)
I wrote a lot that night
INT NOOK - SAME
CRICKET
I had so much to say- not about my
own life for a change but about
imperfect fathers and imperfect
sons- and about loss- and love
The Cricket is writing on a small “desk”
CRICKET (VO)
And for that one evening at least
we were all of us blissfully

oblivious

He intensifies the flame in an oil lamp

EXT STREETS MAIN PLAZA TOWN - DAWN

Geppetto pulls his cart as they head for the church A NEW

ARM for the CRUCIFIXION is in tow

Pinocchio is excited about his new legs They are in

PINOCCHIO

You were right Papa These legs
are much much much much better
than the old ones

(beat)
Ha look at me I can walk
backwards hup And- and- jump
forwards hup I couldn’t do it

Geppetto strains as he pulls his heavy cart- he’s old He
briefly looks at Pinocchio smirks then shakes his head

rolls his eyes and continues ignoring the wooden boy

On a building nearby- a wild gnarly monkey SPAZZATURA
hangs a banner

“COUNT VOLPE’S MAGNIFICENT MARIONETTES”
Spazzatura hears voices and looks below

PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
Ooooh Papa Can you see this He
looks just like me

From above Spazz watches Pinocchio as he goes by The monkey
is amazed at the sight of the living puppet Cricket sees
Spazz gazing at Pinocchio and gasps

CRICKET
What is that

GEPPETTO (0S)
Pinocchio C’mon Hurry up Hurry

GEPPETTO

They round the corner and head towards the church Spazz has
been following them the whole time

Spazz runs away-

EXT PERIPHERY STREETS - EDGE OF TOWN - SAME
He runs down the town streets-

And heads for a set of ROMANESQUE ruins-

EXT ROMANESQUE RUINS - SAME

There a CARNIVAL is setting up around Count Volpe’s puppet
theater

There’s a MERRY GO ROUND and COTTON CANDY VENDING CARTS and
ticket booths and the FREAK SHOW cart and a GIRAFFE AN
ASTROLOGER’s cart and a--

BARREL MAN
Stupid monkey

Spazz runs past and under a few of the carts and knocks on
the door of an ornate beautiful one

INT COUNT VOLPE LIVING HEADQUARTERS - SAME

A Baroque paradise of rotting suede and leaf of gold and
garish lamps somewhat like the church’s red interior

This is Count Volpe’s Palace And at its center in a throne-
like chair sits COUNT VOLPE himself an elegant sleek
trickster- SATAN himself-

COUNT VOLPE
(grumbling)
I’m coming

Full of rage Volpe kicks open the door with a Tex Avery-like
explosion knocking Spazz to the ground

COUNT VOLPE (CONT’D)
What is it What are you doing
here I told you to put up posters
and draw big crowds This carnival
is going to pot And you Can you
not see how desperate the situation
is

Spazz tries to communicate Count Volpe lifts his SILVER CANE
threateningly

COUNT VOLPE (CONTD)
A WHAT

Count Volpe is intrigued
COUNT VOLPE (CONTD)
A “living puppet” Are you

absolutely sure

Spazz continues to gesticulate

COUNT VOLPE (CONT’D)
This could get us to the top again
This could make us kings again

EXT CARNIVAL - SAME

As if from nowhere we see Spazz playing a small violin Count
Volpe begins to sing

COUNT VOLPE (SONG)
We were a King once
Can we be king twice
We were bathing in milk
Played for diamonds and silk
Once
But we want it twice

Volpe prances down the steps and grabs Spazz spinning and
twirling him half dance partner half child’s top

COUNT VOLPE (CONT’D)
My show was a magnet for the crowd
No one could resist Volpe’s crown

He bounds out of the puppet wagon

COUNT VOLPE (CONT’D)
Now the little ones
Now the married ones

He hoists up the TWO-HEADED PERFORMER then hugs the FAT LADY
and MANGIAFUOCCO together

Volpe steals a magazine from one of the CARNIVAL WORKERS

CARNIVAL WORKER 3
Hey
(He trails off cursing in
Italian)

COUNT VOLPE
Prefer Garbo
Gardel Valentino
La voce di Caruso
Jazz on the radio

He rips out the pages highlighting the stars of the day He
tosses them aside one by one

Volpe ties Spazz to a bunch of balloons and releases them in
the air He grabs a rifle from the shooting gallery and
shoots them down before he floats away

COUNT VOLPE (CONT’D)
You were the Kings once
Mon Dieu was it nice
You were knights of the night
Full of glory and might
Once
So let’s get it twice

Volpe and Spazz stick their heads through holes and pose in a
large carnival cutout board

Volpe leaps from post to post as the CARNIVAL WORKERS hammer
them in

sometimes afraid of things they
don’t know- but they’ll get to know
you- and like you And- and for
that

Are you ready for school

Pinocchio nods excitedly

GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
Then I have something I’d like to
give you Ta-da

Geppetto reveals a schoolbook It is CARLO’S old book
name “CARLO” emblazoned on the front

PINOCCHIO
I love it Papa I love it I love
it

Pinocchio is overwhelmed with joy

PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
What is it

GEPPETTO
It is a schoolbook a very
special schoolbook one which
belonged to a very special boy

Was he a very good boy Papa

GEPPETTO
Yes he was

PINOCCHIO
-And you loved him very much

Pinocchio embraces Geppetto- it is a simple but desperate hug-
immensely moving True gratitude the way only a child can

dispense it

PINOCCHIO
Then I will be just like Carlo I
will obey and go to school and I
will be the very very best at
whatever they do there I’1l1 make
you proud

Pinocchio promptly turns and marches out of the church

CRICKET
Don’t listen to him Pinocchio You
promised your Papa you would go to
school

PINOCCHIO
Oh yeah I promised my Papa I’d go
to school See He gave me Carlo’s
book

Pinocchio holds up his book with pride Count Volpe gently
takes it and mockingly admires it

COUNT VOLPE
CARLO’S book Yes yes A classical
canonical work

Count Volpe tosses the book to Spazz who is not ready for
it It hits him just as he is about to pounce on Cricket

COUNT VOLPE (CONT’D)
I can see you are intrinsically an
intellectual But banal book-
learning cannot compare to
witnessing the wide world with
one’s own eyes from atop the
glorious stage

Volpe lifts Pinocchio up spinning him around This causes
Cricket to be thrown off him and onto the ground Volpe
places Pinocchio on a ledge overlooking the entire town

PINOCCHIO
Wow

Spazz takes this opportunity to try and crush Cricket with
the book He narrowly misses

CRICKET
Ahh Wha Gahh Whoa Dear sir

COUNT VOLPE
You shall see ALL the nations of
the earth for yourself as they bow
at your feet

PINOCCHIO
My brand new feet
They move

CRICKET
No No Wait You have to go to
school

PINOCCHIO
Oh- Can we do it tomorrow

COUNT VOLPE
Regretfully no for today is the
only day that our cacophonous
carnival will visit your vicinity
But if you must go to school then
you must go to school

away

COUNT VOLPE (CONT’D)
Come Spazzatura we must find
someone else to eat all our ice
cream and popcorn and hot
chocolate

PINOCCHIO
Hot chocolate

CRICKET
Oh no

Spazz lunges at Cricket but he again manages to avoid him

Cricket jumps up and down desperate to get Pinocchio’s

attention

COUNT VOLPE
Yes of course All the hot
chocolate you can drink And all
the games you can play

PINOCCHIO
Oh boy Oh boy Maybe it’1l be
okay if I’m a little bit late for
school

COUNT VOLPE
Yeah perfectly fine No one will
even notice

CRICKET
Don’t listen to him Pinocchio Wah

(smacking Cricket away)
Ah we have one last detail to take
care of

He produces a LONG LOOOOONG contract- which strikes Cricket
as it unfurls knocking him down the stairs

COUNT VOLPE (CONT’D)
Sign here- here and here Need a
pen

Spazz crushes Sebastian with the book He cackles with glee

PINOCCHIO

Perfect I will now make you burn

They practically scoop Pinocchio off the ground as they push
him along towards the carnival

Who are you I feel as though
youve been here before

I am Pinocchio I’m a boy and I
think I’m dead

DEATH
Ah yes I see The wooden
boywith the borrowed soul My
sister’s folly

Light fades slowly revealing a beautiful Sphinx with a

silver mask identical to the Wood Sprite’s (Again subtly

reminiscent of Carlo’s mother’s face) This is DEATH

DEATH (CONT’D)
The sentimental fool She gave you
life Pinocchio- when you were not
supposed to have it- NO more than a
chair or a table should As a
result You cannot truly- truly-
die

PINOCCHIO
Oh boy oh boy- Andand that’s
GOOD right

DEATH

Well- it means that you are not-
nor will ever be- a real boy like
Carlo

(beat)
The one thing that makes human life
precious and meaningful you see
is death

Death reaches down and grabs a handful of sand

PINOCCHIO
Oh

DEATH
Don’t get me wrong- you will die
Many many times-

She lets it flow through her fingers

She taps the plinth she lays upon activating a set of
increasingly large hourglasses

DEATH (CONT’D)
(clears throat)
This being one of them But they
are not REAL deaths Just waiting
periods There are rules you see
despite my sister’s disregard for
them

She sets down the first one- a tiny hourglass

DEATH (CONT’D)
We will both have to wait for the
sand to run out
(beat)
You will stay here with me a
little longer each time you cross-
until the end of time

The sand has almost run out

PINOCCHIO
And then After that sand runs out

DEATH
I will simply send you back Every
time

to ask you ONE thing--
Ahhhhhhh

Pinocchio steps in

PINOCCHIO
Hey Stop that

Count Volpe turns

PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
Don’t hurt him anymore

COUNT VOLPE
This does not concern you
Pinocchio You’re a star Go
rehearse your steps

Spazz whimpers- he is MOVED by Pinocchio’s defense of him

PINOCCHIO
I DEMAND that you stop You said
it I am the STAR of this show and
I won’t have my co-star treated
this way

Count Volpe scowls Pinocchio is offended

PINOCCHIO (CONTD)
And what is this I hear about my
Papa not getting any money I might
just go home right now and ask him
Whuddaya think about that You can
perform for Il Dulce yourself

Pinocchio starts to walk away but Count Volpe grips Pinocchio
with his cane The mood turns very grim Count Volpe’s eyes
flash with evil

COUNT VOLPE
I think you misunderstand our
relationship my little fire
hazard I am the puppeteer you are
the puppet I am the master and
you are the SLAVE

He pulls out his cane SWORD- directs it at Pinocchio
COUNT VOLPE (CONTD)
And you will do as I command until
your wooden body rots and I use you
to warm my furnace

Count Volpe slashes at Pinocchio with his sword slicing the
tip of his nose off

Pinocchio cries our in terror

COUNT VOLPE (CONT’D)
You may have NO strings- but I
control you You obey me Capiche

As Volpe exits the carnival tent he snaps his fingers and
summons Spazzatura

COUNT VOLPE (CONTD)
Spazzatura

Spazz follows and climbs up onto his shoulder He looks back
pitifully at Pinocchio as they walk away

EXT OCEAN - DAY

He reels up the fishing rod revealing Cricket at the end
being used as bait

CRICKET

A fish leaps out of the water chomping at Cricket Geppetto
is quick to react and manages to grab it

GEPPETTO

Podesta Candlewick and the FASCIST YOUTH from the camp
stand at attention giving the Roman salute and holding up
signs for Il Duce

COUNT VOLPE
Ahh Your Excellency I wrote this

Mussolini ignores Volpe and instead looks at the poster
announcing Pinocchio

MUSSOLINI

Mussolini continues on into the theater leaving Volpe
expectant and standing alone

INT BACKSTAGE PUPPET THEATRE - EVENING

Spazz is sweeping looking miserable licking his wounds
Pinocchio motions to him from across the room

Count Volpe enters backstage as Pinocchio and Spazz finish
conspiring in hushed tones

Eat your boogers your slime

Volpe stands on the side of the stage clutching the script
Baffled He is so nervous he takes a bite out of it

A giant POOP MARIONETTE drops down from the catwalk and
begins dancing alongside Pinocchio

Mussolini is not happy Candlewick laughs uproariously But
his smiles fades under the gaze of the Podesta

PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
Like a bag of poop magnificent and
free
You are farting farting in the
men’s lavatory
You’re a poop We are young
Eat caca Big baby
Eat caca We are strong

SPAZZATURA

A giant Mussolini backdrop flies in But this time it is
vandalized and insulting

Pinocchio flushes himself twirling down an oversized toilet

Song ends The kids go wild Count Volpe is so nervous he
takes a bite out of the script Everyone waits to see
Mussolini’s reaction
Mussolini quietly turns to his Right Hand Man

horrible thing to say to a boy

DEATH
Life can bring great suffering And

wagon)

A HUGE BEAM OF LIGHT inundates the paddy wagon Spielbergian

Pinocchio squints trying to see

EXT YOUTH CAMP - NIGHT

TWIN SEARCHLIGHTS focus on-

-The paddy wagon enters through the gates of an imposing
brutalist edifice in the vicinity of a cliff It’s a
monstrosity imposing like a castle or a prison

TWO MORE SEARCHLIGHTS crisscross the sky looking for enemy
planes

INT YOUTH CAMP - NIGHT

They all follow the Podesta down a long corridor It ends at
a balcony overlooking a large open courtyard below

Nationalistic music swells (EJA EJA ALALA) like a tidal
wave as we reveal the training of several dozen kids
Stabbing with bayonets climbing under and above obstacles
etc

Pinocchio and Candlewick look at each other like “whoa”

PINOCCHIO

But my Papa said war is bad

CANDLEWICK
That’s ‘cause he’s a coward

PINOCCHIO
A coward My Papa

CANDLEWICK
Well-- he’s afraid of war isn’t

Pinocchio turns- whispers

PINOCCHIO
Y’know all fathers love their
sons But sometimes fathers feel

despair- like everyone else- and
they say things they only THINK
they mean in the moment But with
time they learn that they never
really meant it at all And they
may even call you ugly things- like
a burden or a coward but
inside they love you

Candlewick is silent He takes it in Gets serious

CANDLEWICK
Are you scared Of dying

PINOCCHIO
Me Naaaah I died a couple times
and it was alright There’s rabbits
and card games and a LOT of sand
BLUE sand

Candlewick can’t help but laugh with relief at Pinocchio’s
ridiculousness

CANDLEWICK
(chuckling)
You’re so weird

PINOCCHIO
No weirder than you pal

They throw pillows at each other laughing
Beat as they settle in to sleep

CANDLEWICK

INT YOUTH CAMP - DAY

Standing on the open battlefield Podesta stands before all
the boys explaining the rules of the game

PODESTA
-And as with all great empires
the destiny of Italy will be forged
in the strength of its youth Today
you get your first taste of war
You will form two teams

Candlewick and Pinocchio look to one another very proud-
encouraging each other THE PODESTA HANDS OUT TWO FLAGS ONE
is a BLACK CROSS with RADIANT LIGHT against a RED BG
(Pinocchio’s) and the other one is THE BUNDLE OF ARROWS
(Candlewick)

Candlewick exchanges a look and a half smile with his father
It is not returned in kind

PODESTA (CONTD)
In the center of the battlefield is
a tower

The Podesta continues to address the assembly

PODESTA (VO)
The first team to place their flag
at the top of the tower wins And
remember no matter who is on the
other team THEY are your enemy

Podesta places his hands on BOTH Pinocchio and Candlewick

PODESTA
(sotto voce)
May the best man win and bring
glory to his team and honor to us
all

The Podesta’s speech becomes VO as we cut to the tower then
to kids splitting into yellow and red teams preparing their
guns loading their grenades with confetti

PODESTA (CONTD)
The rifles are loaded with paint
and the grenades confetti Mark
your kill boys

After receiving their guns the group takes off for battle
leaving Pinocchio behind

PINOCCHIO
Hey Watch it W-wait

Kids settle into their trenches with expectant grins on their
faces maybe some are goofing off a little

We see Pinocchio and Candlewick on their respective sides
ready for the horn

The horn sounds

KIDS
Eja Eja Alala

WAR begins

Candlewick and Pinocchio exceed expectations Podesta is
pleased to see it going so well

Scenes of war Short action sequence with Candlewick and
Pinocchio commanding their groups It’s fun Pinocchio sees
Candlewick and waves still oblivious

PINOCCHIO
(giggling)
Hi
A boy of Pinocchio’s side gets shot with red paint

CONFIDENT BOY
Argh

Candlewick and another boy laugh at the sight when suddenly
BAM The other boy is hit with a ball of yellow paint

LAUGHING BOY
Heheha Awww

Candlewick looks briefly shocked to see his friend hit but
quickly recovers

CANDLEWICK
C’mon boys Let’s go

The kids dash out of the trenches from both sides
KIDS
Let’s go Charge Watch out Go
go go Yah

Pinocchio races to the tower under a hail of gunfire

CANDLEWICK
Faster Follow me

Candlewick follows with his team

Candlewick and Pinocchio BOTH make it to the tower avoiding
being shot etc--

Pinocchio tosses his gun to one of his teammates

PINOCCHIO
Catch this

They climb and race to the top dodging paint etc-- they
near the top

Podesta looks on from afar

They frantically struggle with one another to see who can get
their flag up the pole

They are fighting for real A tug of war ensues with the
flags as they try to dislodge the other

With one huge tug they both tumble to the ground on opposite
sides of the tower
THE SEARCHLIGHTS backlight them both

Then They suddenly realize the absurdity of what theyre
doing exchange a look and burst into laughter

They come together and shake hands BOTH flags are placed
together and raised up the pole

CUT TO

INT YOUTH CAMP - CONTINUOUS

Candlewick and Pinocchio proudly approach the Podesta who is
now sipping tea with the Priest at a table near the edge of
the battlefield

PODESTA
You’re both here- why

CANDLEWICK
We both won Father

PODESTA
Oh is that so And how did you
come to that conclusion may I ask

PINOCCHIO
It was a tie

CANDLEWICK
We both climbed up fast

Podesta sips calmly

PODESTA
Very good then Candlewick

Podesta takes his own REAL handgun and puts it on the table
PODESTA (CONTD)
(to Candlewick)

Pinocchio and Candlewick shuffle nervously

CANDLEWICK

The Podesta ignores what is happening all around him

PODESTA
I told you to SHOOT THE PUPPET

BOMBS EXPLODE around them Illuminating all with fire
Candlewick looks down at the gun and considers

CANDLEWICK

No I will not let you do this All
my life Fatherjust trying to
please you But I never will You
were right I’m thin and weak- and
flimsy-- just like the wick of a
candle Always afraid But even
then- with all the fear I feel- I
can say “no” to you I can do that

(beat)
I’m not afraid to say no Are you

PODESTA
You filthy coward

Podesta rips the gun from Candlewick’s hand He grabs
Candlewick by the neck lifts and propels him backward

PODESTA (CONTD)
Yes you are weak You are no son
of mine

Podesta tosses him in a ditch like a piece of trash
Pinocchio chases after trying to protect his friend

PINOCCHIO
Candlewick

PODESTA
Puppet on your feet

From atop the ditch Podesta has now turned the gun on
Pinocchio Pinocchio stands and approaches defiant

PODESTA (CONTD)
Time for the final lesson

Pinocchio turns to look at Candlewick still on the ground
Candlewick stares back frozen and afraid

PODESTA (CONTD)
And now you will know what it is to
truly serve the Fatherland

A shot rings out Podesta is struck directly in the eyes by a
blotch of yellow paint

PODESTA (CONTD)
Arggh

He stumbles back disoriented and temporarily blinded
becoming caught in the netting

From behind Pinocchio Candlewick emerges holding the gun
Podesta claws at his eyes furious and struggling to see

He hears a noise and pauses Slowly looks up A BOMB FALLS
The Podesta struggles to free himself There is no escape

It kills Podesta and throws Pinocchio over the parapets

Pinocchio lands on the ground half a mile away His back is
on fire

Candlewick rushes out of the camp calling out Bombs falling
all around him Kids running and screaming Chaos

CANDLEWICK

On the opposite side of the camp Pinocchio veers into
oblivion as we see

Pinocchio wakes up

PINOCCHIO
HUHHH Candlewick

Pinocchio is tied to a post Spazzatura and Volpe stand
nearby

Reveal Pinocchio is tied up Count Volpe is preparing a huge
bonfire

They are by the side of a cliff

In the distance THE YOUTH CENTER and searchlights criss-
crossing the sky BOMBER PLANES release their fiery cargo

COUNT VOLPE
Bonjour mon étoile

PINOCCHIO
No Where’s Candlewick

Spazz stands by Count Volpe - but looks conflicted

PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)

COUNT VOLPE

poor thing I have forgiven him
But you You squandered everything
Count Volpe points his SWORD directly at Pinocchio

COUNT VOLPE (CONT’D)
Give me that torch Spazzatura

Spazz hesitates anguished for Pinocchio

COUNT VOLPE (CONTD)
Spazzatura Errr give me that

Volpe SNATCHES the torch from Spazz and SMACKS him with it
for good measure

COUNT VOLPE (CONTD)
You mangy ape

PINOCCHIO

Burn bright like a star

PINOCCHIO

Volpe lets out a sinister laugh

PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
Please HELP Help Ow Help

And then SPAZZ THINKS AND THINKS AND-

MAKES A DECISION- Leaps off of Volpe and up to Pinocchio He
gets Pinocchio OUT of the fire DRAGS him to safety Flaming

He heads for the cliffs
Volpe chases Spazz cane sword in hand He corners them
But Spazz is afraid
The fall is too big- too scary
COUNT VOLPE

How could you do this to me And

for a puppet You loathsome lusus

naturae

Count Volpe raises his sword

COUNT VOLPE (CONT’D)
You will betray me no more

And then Spazz jumps and bites Volpe on the face

They tumble back and fall down screaming simultaneously
Down-

Down-

Pinocchio looks over the edge- Volpe smashes on the rocks and
Spazz plunges into the water below

PINOCCHIO
Spazzatura

Pinocchio calls out for Spazz still trying to free himself
from the ropes Suddenly another bomb goes off nearby

A seagull passes overhead Spazz tracks it with his eyes

Then they see-

EXT DOGFISH
-a MYSTERIOUS ISLAND

PINOCCHIO

Spazz celebrates happily dancing and pounding on the water

As they are about to go ashore the island rises up out of
the water again This is no island This is THE DOGFISH

PINOCCHIO (CONT’D)
Swim

They paddle with all their might They are swallowed

INT DOGFISH TUBES

They travel through gross tubes Pinocchio gets hit by sharp
teeth and stuff Spazz using him as a shield

INT DOGFISH

They are finally spat out of an ulcer waterfall

Ugh-- Spazz covered in goop completely grossed out

They look up and watch with horror as the tunnel they were
spat out of closes behind them

Pinocchio tries to find another way out but it’s all just
gross fish parts They wade through muck

They look over a precipice and see a dilapidated lighthouse
and the wreckage of a ship There appears to be a small fire
burning off in the distance

Spazz points They head towards it

Spazz is excited for the heat and starts to warm himself by
the fire

Just then they hear a the faint sound of someone singing off
in the distance

Pinocchio shushes Spazz straining to hear
GEPPETTO (SONG)
And if you look at me today my
heart would heal so fast

Pinocchio and Spazz look at each other

PINOCCHIO
Papa Papa

Pinocchio rushes towards the sound sloshing around on planks
of wood

Spazz follows
GEPPETTO (SONG)
And if you held me right away I’d
be complete at last At last

They leap up on the ship and run towards the bow And there
they find Geppetto fishing using Cricket as bait

PINOCCHIO
(shushing Spazz)

Geppetto drops his rod to hug Pinocchio Cricket lets out a
joyous laugh

Pinocchio leans against Geppetto who puts his arm around
him

After youre feeling better we’ll
go right home okay

GEPPETTO

No Pinocchio There is no escape
from this dreaded beast He comes
seeking the warmth of the sun
every decade or so

(beat)
It will soon sink back to the
depths of the darkest coldest
ocean where it dwells and- it will
drag us with him

As Geppetto is talking Cricket stares ahead watching the
smoke from the fire float up and out through the blowhole
Out Out

CRICKET
(laughing)
Oh my God this is it Follow me
Hahaha

GEPPETTO
Follow you where

CRICKET
Up to the lighthouse and freedom

They get up from the fire and dash off trying to keep up
with an excited Cricket They all clamber up to the very tip
of the lighthouse the highest vantage point Cricket perches
on the rail

CRICKET (CONT’D)
The blowholes We can climb out
through them

He points but they are still some distance away

GEPPETTO
But we’ll never reach it It- it’s

his ear

super huge spanning the gap between the lighthouse and the
blowhole Cricket reaches the other side

GEPPETTO
Hahaha that that’s it
CRICKET
Climb now Everybody climb Hurry

Come on

Geppetto gingerly makes his way onto the nose bridge and
starts carefully working his way across Spazz jumps forward
and runs leapfrogging Geppetto and quickly scurries to the
opposite side

GEPPETTO
What are you

As Geppetto continues the branches twist and turn he can
barely hold on

GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
Ooh--oh oh oh--steadywhoa

way forward

GEPPETTO
(trying to balance)
Ehhh--whoa--ahh--my word--oh dear

The nose is rocking and shaking all over the place so much
so that it SNAPS clean off of Pinocchio’s face He lunges
forward quickly to grab a hold of it before it falls

GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
Whoa--hold it--oh Wahh

It’s more steady now and Geppetto manages to make it the rest
of the way across They laugh and celebrate Pinocchio
secures the branch on his end and starts to make his way
across

GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
That’s it Don’t look down
Pinocchio Look at me Look at your

He is halfway when the whole thing twists and rotates
flipping Pinocchio upside down He clings on for dear life

PINOCCHIO
Ahh--Ahhh

As it swings around it almost hits Geppetto and Spazz inside
the blowhole as well

GEPPETTO

Walls around them begin to shake

INT DOGFISH

The branch continues to slip Pinocchio is hanging trying to
keep his grip as the whole thing keeps shifting He finally
manages to right himself but it’s too late The end of the
branch slips from the rail and begins to fall

Pinocchio sprints up the branch as it begins to drop
desperately trying to reach Geppetto and the others

PINOCCHIO
NoNoooo Ahhhh Ahh

He reaches the end and leaps launching himself into space as
the branch plummets below him

GEPPETTO

With a CLAP Geppetto is able to reach out and grab
Pinocchio’s wrist at the last moment

Off in the distance everyone else scrambles onto a makeshift
raft

BAMM The Dogfish reemerges from the depths MORE STEAM THAN
EVER coming from its orifices EYES RED GROANING IN FURY

Pinocchio sees the Dogfish swimming up towards him and knows
hes about to be eaten once again

PINOCCHIO

off in the distance the Dogfish surfaces Clinging to his
tooth we see Pinocchio The chain of the mine is wrapped
around it

PINOCCHIO
Papa Papa

The Dogfish spots the raft and turns towards it menacingly

GEPPETTO
It’s coming for us Quick
Spazz seeing what’s happening jumps back in the sea

CRICKET
Cmon Spazzatura you can do it

Spazz acts as an outboard motor He pushes till it hurts
They start speeding up

They head away- the Dogfish gaining rapidly

Pinocchio looks out from the mouth and sees that the Dogfish
is headed straight for his friends

His eyes quickly search around What can he do

He tracks the chain to the end of the Dogfish’s gullet An
idea dawns on Pinocchio

Pinocchio leaps off the tooth and into the water gushing
through the Dogfish’s mouth He tries to swim towards the
mine

The Dogfish barrels forward with ferocious speed towards the
raft

Pinocchio is swept towards the mine but the current is too
strong

He grasps desperately for the mine but misses and is carried
over the edge

Spazz and Geppetto are paddling with crazy determination

CRICKET (CONT’D)
Yes faster Spazzatura

GEPPETTO
Hold on

The Dogfish gains on our heroes and is ABOUT TO SWALLOW THEM-

Suddenly we see Pinocchio With monumental effort he swims up
the waterfall

He grabs the side of one of the firing pins barely hanging
on

The mouth of the Dogfish opens wide It is right on top on
them

CRICKET
Oh my God this is it

With his last ounce of strength Pinocchio pulls himself up
by one arm and detonates the mine

Gulp Beat BOOOMMMMMM

The Dogfish EXPLODES

Our heroes are thrown asunder by a tidal wave
THE RAFT BLOWS UP

GEPPETTO HITS THE WATER AND SINKS UNCONSCIOUS

Pinocchio pops out of the coffin

PINOCCHIO
No Not Now

CUT TO

INT LIMBO

Pinocchio stands before Death who is setting down a HUGE
hourglass

PINOCCHIO
Send me back now Please I need
to go back to save my Papa

DEATH
You know the rules Pinocchio

Long pause as Death considers Pinocchio

DEATH (CONT’D)
All the sand must fall before you
can return

PINOCCHIO
There’s no time He’s dying

DEATH
Rules are rules And if we BREAK
them--

She taps the glass of the timer with her claw very
deliberately

DEATH (CONT’D)
--There are dire consequences

Pinocchio knows she is trying to tell him something but
doesn’t quite understand He steps closer to the glass timer
DEATH (CONT’D)
If you were to go back now- so soon-
you would become mortal
(beat)

You might save Geppetto But you

will die Pinocchio And it will be

your last life

PINOCCHIO
I don’t care- send me back
(beat)
Do it
He looks at Death
DEATH
Not me wooden boy Break the
rules Break them If you’re sure
She TAPS the glass again This time a small crack appears
Pinocchio turns back to the timer and--
SMASHES IT The sand scatters
All the timers behind Death instantly burst
A portal opens on the ground behind Pinocchio
Death and Pinocchio bow to each other in acknowledgment
DEATH (CONT’D)
Now go to your father child And

make the most of it

Pinocchio takes a running leap and dives through

EXT OCEAN - DAY

Pinocchio shoots out of the water He is missing an arm and
part of his leg-- now just stumps

He falls back in then rises to the surface and GASPS for
breath He’s alive He has a chance to save Geppetto

PINOCCHIO
Papa
His missing limbs make it hard for him to swim but he
reaches Geppetto and gets him on his back With ALL HIS MIGHT

he heads towards the shore struggling choking

PINOCCHIO (CONTD)
Papa

He pushes Geppetto to shore

We do not see Pinocchio

EXT BEACH - DAY

Spazzatura drags himself out of the ocean The beach is
covered in MINES from the ocean The ocean is now pristine

The Dogfish is nowhere in sight
Spazz is utterly exhausted but RELIEVED He made it Land
Something wriggles in Spazz’s mouth He coughs up Cricket
CRICKET
We- we made it Hahaha I can’t

believe it

GEPPETTO (0S)
COUGH COUGH

Cricket and Spazzatura look over

Geppetto and Pinocchio have washed up on the beach
Geppetto rises and spits up ocean water

Pinocchio does not PINOCCHIO IS INERT

Geppetto rushes to Pinocchio

GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
Pinocchio My boy myboy

Geppetto kneels over Pinocchio’s limp destroyed body and
raises his head out of the water His eyes are lifeless dots

GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
Wake up Pinocchio Like last time
Get up You’re fine You- you-

Spazz and Cricket rush to Geppetto When they see they know

Pinocchio is dead His body moves gently with the tide

Tears in his eyes Geppetto desperately tries to reanimate
Pinocchio

GEPPETTO (CONT’D)
You are here my dear son can’t
you see me You’re-- youre alive
youre so free I need youmy
son

Geppetto weeps
The Wood Sprite appears beside them

WOOD SPRITE
Master GeppettoI only wished to
bring you joy

Geppetto looks to see the Wood Sprite too grief-stricken to
be amazed by the sight of her

GEPPETTO
And you DID You DID bring me joy--
(embracing Pinocchio)
--such terrible terrible joy
Please Bring him back to me

WOOD SPRITE
To save you he became a real boy
And real boys don’t come back

GEPPETTO
I know that I know but

Then the Cricket stands up FURIOUS

CRICKET
It’s not FAIR In this world you
get what you give remember And
this boy gave-- why he gave
everything he could

The Wood Sprite looks at them both Considers

CRICKET (CONT’D)
You said if I should perform my
duties and make Pinocchio a good
boy- guide him into doing what is
right you would concede me one
wish

WOOD SPRITE
I did And did you accomplish this
task

CRICKET
OKAY Fine So maybe I didn’t do so
great Maybe I messed up a little-
or a lot- but- Well I tried my
best and that’s the best anyone can
do PINOCCHIO taught me that I
mean I taught it to him and then
he taught it straight back at me
And- You know why Because- because
he was GOOD

Everyone is touched by the Cricket’s words
The Wood Sprite nods

WOOD SPRITE
Well then noble Cricket Choose
wisely

CRICKET
Well gosh darn it I wish him
back to life

The Wood Sprite places her hands on Pinocchio He begins to
glow

WOOD SPRITE
Very well then Little wooden boy
made of pine- may you rise with the
sun and wander the earth- be his
son- fill his days with light So
hell never be alone

GEPPETTO
PINOCCHIO- my child- I was trying
to make you someone you were not
So- don’t be Carlo or anyone else
Be exactly who you are I- I love
you exactly as you are

And so Pinocchio awakes
PINOCCHIO
Then I will be Pinocchio And you
will be my Papa Will that do

GEPPETTO
That will do

The Wood Sprite fades away

They all begin to laugh and celebrate
The Cricket watches feeling a little emotional himself

CRICKET
Oh- life is such a wonderful gift

The Rabbits look around confused Cricket breaks into song
Credits roll over song

CRICKET (SONG) (CONT’D)
My dear father loved to say
Hop to the top of a day
The drops are easy to swallow
My dear father loved to say
Mop your tears and mend your
sorrows
To not drown your soul wishing for
better tomorrows
You want to think bright
You want to think right
A star falling down down down
Doesn’t break the night
You want to think bright
Whatever you do
Shadows brings you down down down
Dimming all the light
As you try to climb
For life has a funny way of going
‘round and ‘round
On a ride it goes one day side to
side one day upside down
Down down

You can make it right

Well worth a good fight

And if some days have downs and

lows

Open your arms to better tomorrows

A floating tune is in the air

(whistling)

The simple things you care to share

(whistling)

A trace of light a flock of

sparrows

Anything high you dare to follow

Open your arms to better tomorrows

Tomorrows

You want to think bright

You want to think right

To let your heart sing sing sing

On a summer night

You want to think bright

Whatever you do

When the strings go zing zing

zing

Fly high with the band

Just get up and swing

(whistling)

You can make it right

Well worth a good fight

And if some days have downs and

lows

Open your arms to better tomorrows

CRICKET (SONG) (CONTD)
Watercolors in May painting a
purple sky
A pen a line a river

Strokes on a mandolin playing a
gentle sigh

These are the simple things that
matter

You want to think bright

You want to think right

And let your heart sing sing sing
On a summer night

You want to think bright

Whatever you do

Teeny bells go ding ding ding
Laughing in the wind

A kite on a string

For life has a funny way of going
‘round and ‘round

On a ride it goes one day side to
side one day upside down

Down down

And you make it right

And your heart is bright

So let the world know how it goes
Open your arms to better

Open your arms to better tomorrows
