The WORKERS on the field freeze Little Cecil stares in
shock at his father’s body twitching against the cotton a
chunk of his head in the dirt A fly lands on Cecil’s brow

house waving his gun around

THOMAS

counter The hunger in his eyes blood mixed with white
frosting against his black skin are a site of the macabre

hungry

Then a VOICE calls out from across the room

SHAKES from nerves He grips the cup with the other hand to
stop the rattling and carefully sets it down on Ike’s desk
Ike steps forward his presence overtakes the room

send troops to the South Ever It

HERBERT BROWNELL
Sir if the Federal government
doesn’t enforce Brown then who
will The South must comply with
the law

IKE

to adjust that’s all

edge He quickly takes out a napkin and dries the saucer

HERBERT BROWNELL
I understand Mr President but if
Faubus continues to block the negro
children then what do we do We
must enforce the Constitution

Cecil places a cup of tea in front of Sherman Adams trying
to be as obsequious as possible

SHERMAN ADAMS

grabs his tray and hurries out of the room

listening Senator Kassebaum turns to Ronnie with urgency

Apartheid
