Wait --

In deep shadow the RED THING observes with bright
eyes veined with streaks of burnt sienna

Broom slowly fishes a BABY RUTH candy bar from his
Peeling back the wrapper he slowly waves the candy
THING shrinks back

Broom bites into the candy and chews noisily smacking
lips Offers the candy again This time out of the
comes a small FACE not very different from the stone
around it

The creature extends its right arm its solid stone
tiny runes engraved around the thick cylindrical

Four articulated stone fingers wiggle reaching for the
chocolate

in a cracked bone-dry bed of mud Liz lies on the

Hellboy slowly comes to He is chained to a massive

wooden

yoke He takes notice of his surroundings a large
church-

like space surrounded by funeral niches and statues
holding

swords High columns flank huge mechanical gears An
SOLAR

SYSTEM MODEL takes the place of an altar
Off to one side Ilsa uses a hammer to destroy the
timers on

the explosive belts

Next to the main nave Myers is tied to a stone pillar

Under
his feet a blood channel leading to the immense stone
slab
bought from Lapikov
Liz lies at Grigorys feet Hes dressed ina
ceremonial
robe and holds his leather book open His back to
Hellboy
he faces a mural of the angel Abbadon holding a key
GRIGORY
And I looked and beheld an Angel
and in his hand the key to the
bottomless pit
Hellboy tenses rage building The yoke creaks but
doesnt
bend

peasant boy in Tobolsk And now the

that they might at long last enter

You are the key The right hand of
doom

Hellboy studies the stone sculpture its three HAND

What did you think it was made for
Open the locks

Hellboy stares at his huge right arm as if for the
first

Ilsa kicks Myers in the face

The open dome above reveals the moon An eclipse is
beginning

In exchange for her life then open

If you want her back

BEHEMOTH The size of a house --

Hellboy -- head smoking -- writhes in the grip of the
tentacle It suddenly throws him toward the ceiling

As he arcs back down ABM -- he cracks the floor wide
Next to him the rosary and the EXPLOSIVE BELTS He
grab them The tentacle slams down blocking his way
The vibration sends the belts down into the crack They
off a small ledge and land further down Far below
cogwheels and gears

Hellboy manages to pull a steel sword from the closest
statue

Hellboy stands up and swings the sword for all hes
FWAP He cuts clean through the tentacle The tip hits
floor rolling into the crack

From out of Behemoths stump a mass of wriggling

He wraps them around his stone arm
