SCOTT
Well hes the head of an evil
organization that has aspirations
for world domination

JERRY SPRINGER

a giant egg and stuffed inside a Big
Boy rocket with his cat Mr
Bigglesworth

JERRY SPRINGER
Really Well we have a surprise for
you Scott Lets bring out

Dr Evil enters
Lower Third Chyron WANTS TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD

DR EVIL
Hello Scott Im back

SCOTT
I cant believe youd do this to me
on national television

DR EVIL
They offered me a free makeover

JERRY SPRINGER
Dr Evil weve seen a lot of the
fathers here today open up to their
sons sons to the fathers Is there
anything youd like to share

DR EVIL
Share

JERRY SPRINGER
Yes dont you have any secrets

DR EVIL
OK I have a vestigial tail

Everyone is a little grossed out
DR EVIL

Its more of a nub really The spine
just goes on a little longer than it
should Also Ive dabbled I mean
perform fellatio once and youre a
poet twice and youre a homosexual
I remember once I was being fisted
by Sebastian Cabot- but heres where
the story gets interesting He was
lactose-intolerant He could eat red
meat all night long but one sip of
milk and it was gastric hell And I
remember we were caught in fragrance
delicto by Henry Kissinger and you
can imagine my humiliation at having
Hank hear me say Mr French no
teeth One of my greatest
disappointments is that I never became
a song and dance man I could have
been a quadruple threat kind of
like a despotic Ken Barry Dancer
singer actor and I would possess
nuclear weapons the latter being
the most threatening of the four I
once sat on a bus and tried to will
myself a menstrual cycle All I ended
up with was a sense of failure anda
mild neuralgia in my incisor teeth
and perhaps a grudging respect for
the weaker sex I love toe cleavage
For the most part I distrust dogs I
slept in a horse once It was quite
roomy On second thought it was the
Ritz I named my left testicle piss
and my right testicle vinegar I
wrote Its Raining Men or so the
Christmas babies told me Oh yes I
also made a Marzipan voodoo effigy
of The Fonze while I was in coma
after smoking some Peruvian prayer
hash but who at the end of the day
can honestly say they havent done
that

The Springer audience is stunned slack-jawed and for
once
quiet

KLANSMAN
What are you some kind of freak

SCOTT
Shut up jagoff

Studio audience whoops at this
KLANSMAN
Ill kick your ass punk

Crowd goes crazy

DR EVIL
No one talks to my boy that way

Dr Evil charges at Klansman and starts to bitch slap

him
Security men with headsets on rush in to separate
them
DR EVIL
Im OK Im OK
There is a BEAT then Dr Evil CHARGES the guy again
knocking
him down
DR EVIL
Come Scott lets go to daddys new
evil lair
EXT WORLD HEADQUARTERS BUILDING - DAY
We pan up a modern office building The camera reaches
the
top of the building and we see a giant STARBUCKS LOGO
and
the words Starbucks World Headquarters
INT STARBUCKS BOARD ROOM
The penthouse boardroom is adorned with Starbucks
paraphernalia large logo clear canisters full of
beans
and a large world map with a little logo everywhere
there is
a Starbucks
Around a large table are Dr Evil Number Two (bandaged
and
lightly spotted with soot) Frau Scott and a couple of
NEW
HENCHMEN A Starbucks employee serves everyone steaming
hot

coffee products

NUMBER TWO
Dr Evil as the legitimate frontman
of your organization I seized upon
the opportunity to invest in a small
Seattle-based coffee company several
years ago Today Starbucks is a far-
flung empire with 2000 outlets
worldwide

DR EVIL
Oh good Number Two I do enjoy a
good cuppa joe

NUMBER TWO
If I may continue I believe if we
shift our resources away from world
domination and focus on providing
premium quality coffee drinks we
can increase our gross profits
fivefold

Dr Evil takes a sip of cappuccino leaving a WHITE
FROTHY
MILK MUSTACHE on his upper lip

DR EVIL
Right Perhaps youve confused me
with someone who gives a shit Might
I remind you that I run the show
here I demand a little respect

NUMBER TWO
(indicating Dr Evils
milk mustache)
Dr Evil I think you--

DR EVIL
Silence I will not tolerate your
insolence Remember what happened
last time

FLASHBACK (FOOTAGE FROM FIRST MOVIE)

reinstating me after our little
misunderstanding
DR EVIL
Frau Farbissina Wie gehts is einen

We see Frau She looks a little more masculine than
before

FRAU
Zehr gut Herr Doctor

DR EVIL
How are things

FRAU
I have come to embrace the love that
dare not speak its name To my right
is my lover

We see a severe-looking German woman with one
continuous
eyebrow

FRAU
Her name is Unibrau I met her on
the LPGA Tour

DR EVIL
Right on Welcome Unibrau

Dr Evil takes another sip of cappuccino making the
frothy
milk mustache even larger

FRAU
Doctor you have a milk mustache

DR EVIL
(wiping it off
embarrassed)
Oh I know I know

NUMBER TWO
Dr Evil Id like to introduce the
Greek assassin Oedipus
We see a swarthy Greek army guy
DR EVIL
Welcome to my private army Oedipus

Excited

OEDIPUS
I could give a shit

DR EVIL
Kiss your mother with that mouth

OEDIPUS
Yes

DR EVIL
Of course you do

Dr Evil begins to press a button labelled Oedipus on
his
control panel but Number Two interrupts

NUMBER TWO
(clearing throat)
Dr Evil as you know the rate at
which you liquidate henchmen far
exceeds our ability to replace them

DR EVIL
I have so few pleasures left to me
Number Two The key to life is to
rotate your vices One day its
executions another day its creamy
French cheese Its like frickin
heroin

NUMBER TWO
Well Dr Evil perhaps I have the
answer While you were frozen we
began a program to clone you

DR EVIL
Cool

NUMBER TWO
We had a few glitches but I think
youll be pleased with the results

FRAU
(shouting)
Send in the clone

MUSIC dramatic sting We see the shadow of an
approaching

figure The shadow looks like Dr Evil only much
larger and

scarier

NUMBER TWO
He is identical to you in every way
except he is one-eighth your size

We see that the source of the shadow is a MINIATURE DR

EVIL
just like the creepy mini-Marlon Brando in The Island
of Dr
Moreau He mimics Dr Evils mannerisms including
holding
his tiny pinky to his tiny mouth
DR EVIL
Breathtaking I shall call him Mini-
Me
(to clone)
Mini-Me you will sit to my right
Mini-Me sits down in a miniature version of Dr Evils
command

Evils

Mes

No

Tired Gentleman I have a plan As
you know the most powerful man in
the world is the President of the
United States But he is just that-
aman subject to temptations of the
flesh like any other man Heres
what we do we make it seem that the
President has had extra-marital
oral relations with- and this is
the kicker-

DRAMATIC STING SNAP ZOOM TO DR EVIL

DR EVIL

Dr Evil gloats So does Mini-Me

NUMBER TWO
(clearing his throat)
Uh-hem

DR EVIL
What that already happened

Number Two nods

DR EVIL
This is ri-goddamn-diculous Oh well
how about a frickin time machine
Does the president have a time
machine Have I been scooped on that

NUMBER TWO
No not that Im aware of

DR EVIL
Alright time machine it is As you
know every diabolical scheme Ive
hatched has been thwarted by Austin
Powers And why is that ladies and
gentlemen

SCOTT
Because you never kill him when you
get the chance and youre a dope

Mini-Me hops upon the table and tries to push the
Scott
Evil button on Dr Evils control panel

Frau SQUIRTS him with a water bottle Mini-Me glares at
Scott
and GIVES HIM THE FINGER

DR EVIL
No because Austin Powers has mojo

NUMBER TWO
Mojo

FRAU
Yes mojo The mojo is the life force
the essence the libido the right
stuff

DR EVIL
Its what the French call a certain
I dont know what

SCOTT
If youve got a time machine why
dont you just go back and kill Austin
Powers when hes a baby or something

DR EVIL
No no no
NUMBER TWO
(interrupting)

Dr Evil wouldnt it be easier to
use your knowledge of the future to
play the stock market We could
literally make trillions

DR EVIL
(smug laugh to himself)
Why make trillions when we could
make
(pause)
Billions

NUMBER TWO
Excuse me

DR EVIL
Why think small is all Im saying

SCOTT
A trillion is more than a billion
numb-nuts

DR EVIL
Zip it Unveil the time portal

A wall panel opens to reveal a Stargate-like wall of
shimmering energy

DR EVIL
Ladies and gentlemen I give you the
time portal As you know Austin
Powers was frozen in 1967 Therefore
I time travel to 1969 two years
after he was frozen Security will
be lax and Ill strike when he is
totally helpless

First I take Austin Powers mojo Then I begin my
domination
of the world

SCcoTT

As Dr Evil walks to the center of the room chairs

How are you baby

My chakras are aligned and I am ina
perfect state of equipoise

AUSTIN
Good on ya I dont know what that
means but it sounds fab
FELICITY
Guru we need some advice

GURU PITKA
Hold your horses and any other beasts-
of burden I must lead my disciples
in meditation and then I will help
you

The Guru walks to the front of the room and the
disciples
sink to their knees

DISCIPLES
Ahhhhhh

GURU PITKA
My name is the Guru Pitka I ama
spiritual teacher and I have combined
many disparate disciplines into a
unified movement of human potentiality
and equipoise that I learned from my
guru the late Guru Shastri a chaste
man who died mysteriously of a disease
that strangely had all the hallmarks
of syphilis He would say to me
Sparky love is all life is breath

DISCIPLES
Ahhhhhh

GURU PITKA

Now perhaps you are wondering where
I got the nickname Sparky Well
when we were young we used to play a
game called Stinkmop We would
urinate into a bucket dip a mop
into it and play tag I did not
care for Stinkmop and a very wise
old man said to me oh lighten up
Sparky and I dont know the name
kind of stuck

DISCIPLES
Ahhhhhhhh

GURU PITKA
Now the reason I am a spiritualist
instead of a therapist is that
therapist often becomes the rapist’
and that will not help us attain
HERE

ME

TAUGHTS

BUT

Guru holds up a card that says

potentiality Now what is
potentiality It is the ability to
achieve those goals that we wish to
achieve for ourselves People often
say to me that they feel nowhere
and I am going to change that to
Now here

The guru holds up a card which says NOWHERE

DISCIPLES
Ahhhhhhh

GURU PITKA
And you have many assumptions about
your goals but when you assume
You make an ass out of u and
me

Guru holds up a card which says ASSUME ASS -

DISCIPLES
Ahhhhhhh

GURU PITKA
The being or that which we call
ourselves is not the tinker It

is not the taughts It is the Gap
between the tinker and the taughts
We are not our mind we are not our
body we are the Gap

THE GAP with the familiar Gap font

DISCIPLES
Ahhhhh

GURU PITKA

(rapid fire)
The heart of the matter is that you
are the heart of the matter There
is no I in team Beer before
liquor never sicker Dont take a
wooden nickel If your pipe is short
and your pump is weak you better
stand close or youll piss on your
feet He who goes to bed with itchy
bum wakes up with smelly finger

Finally the path to spiritual
awakening requires the death of ego
