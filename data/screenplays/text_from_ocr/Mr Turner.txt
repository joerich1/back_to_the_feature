shutters Light streams into the room Hannah brings him a
small glass of sherry which he drinks She helps him to
open the shutters and to move a work table

A bustling market TURNER SNR passes by the stalls
inspecting the wares as he goes

He enters a butcher’s shop

for him

Turner’s house

In the kitchen Hannah pounds some

ingredients with a mortar Turner Snr puts down his
The pig’s head is visible

TURNER SNR

listening to the old man and his son

In Turner’s studio

TURNER SNR
Youre home Billy boy

TURNER
Hey Daddy

They hug each other

TURNER SNR

where Turner is preparing some watercolours

TURNER SNR
How was your crossing

TURNER
Set fair on departure lumpy in the
middle

TURNER SNR
Did you sail from Rotterdam

TURNER

No Dieppe Night coach from
Brighton proved to be an heinous
travail

TURNER SNR
How so

TURNER
It was stuffed full of yacking and
cackling females Pox-ridden
harridan as broad in the beam as
the old Victory at Trafalgar

TURNER SNR
Were your travels productive

TURNER
Exceeding refreshing old Daddy
Amsterdam had a gander at the
Rembrandt Militia Company Antwerp

TURNER

Bronchials still rattling

He was wheezing last week
TURNER SNR

Shh

TURNER SNR

bladder
TURNER
Gawd’s truth That brigand still
robbing us is he

TURNER SNR
You’re in need of a shave

TURNER
Well be that as it may Daddy
Presently Im gonna throw myself
into the arms of Morpheus

Turner leaves the room and goes upstairs Hannah hovers for
a moment then leaves The old man attends to some
paperwork

Turner’s house Turner Snr bears a very large canvas through
the hall and into the studio

In the kitchen Hannah watches as Turner Snr shaves the pig’s
head

Turner Snr carries a jug of hot water up the stairs and
enters Turner’s bedroom

Turner is asleep on his bed fully clothed His father
pinches his toe He wakes up Church bells chime in the
distance

A little later Turner Snr is shaving his son

TURNER SNR
I took a trip down west Exeter
last week
TURNER
How fares the old uncle

TURNER SNR
Bearing up considering

TURNER
Considering what

TURNER SNR

Well his age living alone
Here’s the thing He wants to
arrange a family gathering

They both roar with laughter

Father and son are eating at the kitchen table Hannah sits
nearby watching them The cooked pig’s head sits on a large
plate

TURNER SNR
Will you take some more cheek

TURNER
Cast us another morsel

Turner Snr serves his a slice of pork Hannah gives him some
vegetables

HANNAH
Missing your button Mr Billy

Turner inspects his coat Hannah scratches the back of her
neck which is a little inflamed

A darkened room in Turner’s house hardly lit - only a couple
of candles Turner Snr shows three middle-aged people into
the room and ELEGANT LADY and GENTLEMAN and a long-haired
bespectacled ARTISTIC-LOOKING MAN

TURNER SNR
Be so kind as to enter the
vestibule The darkness is to a
purpose I shall return by and

by

He goes out closing the door behind him The gentleman
whispers something to the lady Long pause Then Turner Snr
returns He moves round them

TURNER SNR
Madam Gentlemen

He stops by some double doors which are closed

TURNER SNR
Behold

Turner’s brightly-lit art gallery is revealed

TURNER SNR
Three steps down Pray view at
your leisure

The trio step down into the gallery and begin to peruse the
paintings Turner Snr hovers near the door

Turner is in his studio painting at an easel He stops and
goes to the wall he opens a very small door about the size
of a small book and looks through a tiny peep-hole into the
gallery Turner Snr smiles slyly at him as the potential
customers inspect the goods

A little later Turner is still painting in his studio

His father is relaxing in the drawing room reading his
newspaper and smoking his pipe There is a loud knock on the
front door He looks up

On her way to the front door Hannah closes the door of
Turner’s studio

In the drawing room Turner Snr listens to the following
which we only hear So does Turner in his studio He is not
pleased

SARAH DANBY
Good day to you Hannah

HANNAH
Good day to you Aunt Sarah

SARAH DANBY
And how are you faring

HANNAH
Very well thank you Are you

SARAH DANBY

home

HANNAH

SARAH DANBY

SARAH DANBY now bursts aggressively into Turner’s studio
accompanied by her two adult DAUGHTERS one of whom holds a
newborn baby

SARAH DANBY
Good day to you sir

TURNER
And a very good day to you Mrs D

He continues to paint

SARAH DANBY
And how do we find you on this fair
morning

TURNER
Exceedingly preoccupied madam

SARAH DANBY
‘Twas ever thus You’ve always
been preoccupied You’re too
preoccupied for your own good sir

TURNER
Nothing comes from nothing madam
SARAH DANBY
And we have had nothing from you
sir Evelina Georgiana come and
greet your father

EVELINA
Good day Father May I present my
child to you

SARAH DANBY
Your granddaughter

EVELINA
Rosalie Adelaide

SARAH DANBY
Your only surviving grandchild
Georgiana cease your dithering

The younger daughter who has hovered by the door comes
forward tentatively

TURNER
May I suggest Mrs D with the
utmost respect that you withdraw
to the drawing room

Turner Snr enters

TURNER SNR
Good day to you Mrs Danby Would
you care to step this way

SARAH DANBY
Good day to you Mister Turner
(To Turner)
And will you be gracing us with
your presence in the withdrawing
room sir

TURNER
Hmm

SARAH DANBY
I sincerely hope you will And
pray do not keep us waiting We
have our own lives to lead Come
along daughters

EVELINA
The vapours in this room are most
noxious to a child’s lungs

The women all sweep out Turner Snr exchanges an
understanding glance with his son then leaves closing the
door behind him As he does so Turner angrily kicks a stool
across the studio

In the drawing room Evelina has sat down holding the baby
Sarah and Georgiana stand by the sofa Hannah hovers
Turner Snr enters

TURNER SNR
Ladies pray sit yourselves
Sarah if you please

SARAH DANBY
I shall be seated William when it
suits me and not before

TURNER SNR
So be it She’s a pretty little
thing

EVELINA

SARAH DANBY
We are surviving as best we can
under the circumstances

TURNER SNR
And what circumstances might they
be

SARAH DANBY
Straightened circumstances sir
But we manage to keep body and soul
together no thanks to your
ungrateful son

Turner walks out of the room Sarah gets up and shouts
after him

SARAH DANBY
How dare you take your leave of me
Billy Turner You insult me as
you have always insulted me
Billy

A street Turner gets into a two-horse coach A coachman
holds the door open for him then closes it and clambers up
onto the back of the coach There are two coachmen at the
front One of them is driving The coach leaves

Now the coach wends its way through the beautiful English
countryside

It arrives at a stately home

Later Sunset Across an expansive meadow towards the house
comes an elderly gentleman with his dogs This is LORD
EGREMONT and the house is Petworth Turner watches him from
the steps Lord Egremont arrives the dogs disperse and the
two men walk through a couple of rooms A piano is being
played somewhere nearby

LORD EGREMONT
Good evening William

TURNER
Felicitations of the evening to
you Your Lordship You faring
well

LORD EGREMONT
Bit breathless Been up to the
farm Watch the sunset Say
goodnight to the milkmaids

TURNER
Any further consideration as to
mechanicalising the thresher

LORD EGREMONT
You can’t beat the old oxen

TURNER
Is that so Your Lordship

LORD EGREMONT
Indeed We had a ploughing
competition last spring between
teams of horses and teams of oxen

TURNER
And the victor

LORD EGREMONT
The horses

TURNER
Well the ox is a sluggish beast

LORD EGREMONT
Yes but strong

TURNER
With the added benefit when it
comes to the end of its natural
working life it makes a very
succulent dish

LORD EGREMONT
Unlike the horse

TURNER
Good for glue

A STOUT AFFECTED FELLOW has been hovering in the background
He now approaches them

MANNERS
Your Lordship A very good evening
to you sir

LORD EGREMONT
Good evening Manners

MANNERS
Mr Turner Are we not blessed by
the heavens to witness so glorious
a crepuscular time of day

He leaves them

LORD EGREMONT
Imbecile

Turner and Lord Egremont now inspect a pair of Turner’s
landscapes that have clearly been painted specially for the
permanent positions they occupy in the room

TURNER
Continuing satisfaction as to the
arrangement Your Lordship

LORD EGREMONT
I think we have successfully
achieved the correct effect
William

TURNER
Thank you

They move on passing a wigged footman who is seeing to the
candelabra on the mantelpiece

LORD EGREMONT
Good evening Nat

FOOTMAN
Good evening My Lord

They now pass A LADY playing the piano

LORD EGREMONT
Good evening Miss Coggins

MISS COGGINS
Your Lordship Mr Turner

Turner and Lord Egremont arrive at two more of Turner’s
paintings set in the wall

LORD EGREMONT
How’s your Father faring William

TURNER
Bearing up Your Lordship Very
gracious of you to inquire We
thought we’d lost him this last
winter a very harsh one He came
through He’s a hardy old cove

LORD EGREMONT
Excellent See you at dinner

TURNER
Indeed

After a momentary pause Turner joins Miss Coggins standing
near the piano until she finishes playing

TURNER
Exceedingly beautiful

MISS COGGINS
You are too kind

TURNER
I’m familiar with the melody
but

MISS COGGINS
Herr Beethoven The Pathétique

TURNER
I possess a rare fondness for Henry

TURNER

In thy breast Remember me

(Pause)
A song of lost love

MISS COGGINS
Indeed

TURNER
I thank you

MISS COGGINS
Thank you Mr Turner

TURNER
Madam

He leaves discretely Miss Coggins is overcome with

emotion

Elsewhere in the house two slightly hysterical YOUNG LADIES
rush up a staircase stopping at the top by a doorway They
giggle at something going on in the room which they then
enter Watched by a stout MIDDLE-AGED LADY sitting near

him Turner is painting at an easel
them

The young women join
LADY STUCKLEY
Mr Turner I have often pondered
might there be a distinction

between the way you paint a sunrise

as opposed to a sunset

TURNER
There is indeed Lady Stuckley
‘Cause one is going up whilst the
other is going

FIRST YOUNG LADY
the other is going down

SECOND YOUNG LADY
Eliza do hush

LADY STUCKLEY
And might it also be determined by
the angle of the light

TURNER
Well it’s weather vapour wind
frangibility and such like

SECOND YOUNG LADY
Eliza look at his nails

FIRST YOUNG LADY
Shh

TURNER
Whilst you Goddesses are
languishing in the Kingdom of
Hypnos I am up before the lark to
witness Helios popping his head
above the parapet with the only
benefit that the sunrise is not
afflicted with diminishing
light

He spits on the canvas One of the young ladies laughs

whilst the other turns away in disgust

Still at Petworth Turner leads a bespectacled man into a
room where a third man is looking at a painting The men

are HAYDON a painter and CAREW a sculptor

Carew speaks

with an Irish accent The painting is “Saint Sebastian
comforted by an Angel” by Gerard Seghers Turner slaps Carew

on the back
TURNER
Carew

CAREW
Turner I’m by way of observing
poor Saint Sebastian here

HAYDON
The artist is not known to me

TURNER
Flemish Uncommonly capacious rump
on the cherub

HAYDON
It might have gained in potency
with an increase of arrows

TURNER
Well yon celestial fellow’s
tugging them all out

HAYDON
I can hardly bear to look upon it

CAREW
The pain on his face The mark of
resignation in it

HAYDON
‘Tis a willing sacrifice is it
not

TURNER
‘Twas not how the poor soul
perished He was brought back to
full health by a good Samaritan
Then the heathens cudgelled him to
death and deposited him in a sewer

HAYDON
I would question the veracity of
that telling

TURNER
No good deed goes unpunished

At this Carew promptly leaves

HAYDON
What a curious fate is mine Last
month in the King’s Bench Prison in
the company of debtors

(MORE)

HAYDON (CONTD)
This month a guest of quality rank
and fashion

TURNER
Rejoice Haydon You find yourself
in a veritable bacchanalia His
Lordship keeps a very fine wine
cellar Be sanguine Fill your
boots

HAYDON
Might I ask you to loan me some
money Turner

TURNER
I beg your pardon

HAYDON
I’m in dire and pressing need of
one hundred pounds

TURNER
Out of the question

HAYDON
My landlord he’s a good man a
patient man but he will not wait
forever I need to pay the wine
merchant my colourman

TURNER
And your dear wife Mrs Haydon
she faring well

HAYDON
Mrs Haydon is presently with
child

TURNER
Well you have my hearty
congratulations Haydon

HAYDON
Congratulations are not in order
I’m in torment

TURNER
I’m not unsympathetic to your
impecunity Haydon Therefore I
can advance you fifty pounds

HAYDON
Turner if one hundred pounds will
not spare me from this predicament
what in Jesu’s name can fifty
pounds do

TURNER
Then you are refusing to accept the
fifty pounds

HAYDON
It is damned inadequate

TURNER
I wish you good day sir

Turner leaves Haydon hesitates for a moment then follows
him to the doorway to the expansive meadow

HAYDON
Turner My word is my bond I may
not yet be an Academician but I am
a gentleman I have a painting
presently with the King at Windsor
I’m assured he will buy it from me
for five hundred guineas or more
Furthermore I have another fine
painting in mind a companion
piece which he is most certain to
purchase in addition

TURNER
Who has made these assurances

HAYDON
The King’s private secretary
Knighton

Turner grunts

TURNER
I can furnish you with five pounds
this morning

HAYDON
Five pounds Fifty pounds is not
sufficient Five pounds is
tantamount to an insult

TURNER
Sir I beseech you brook your ire
If you attend my residence at
London I will loan you fifty
pounds

HAYDON
In addition to the five

TURNER
Mr Haydon you are exceedingly
tiresome

HAYDON
I am gratified I humbly accept
the fifty pounds Might I find you
at the same address I may swim

Haydon strides off purposefully JONES LESLIE and BEECHEY
join Turner they all watch Haydon recede into the distance

JONES
‘And the spirit immediately drove
him out into the wilderness’

LESLIE
A tormented soul for sure I
sympathise but he attributes all
of his failures to anything other
than his own behaviour

BEECHEY
Indeed

LESLIE
His complaint with life is as
absurd as that of a spoke in a
wheel railing against the motion
that it must of necessity partake

TURNER
I concur He suffers the fate of
Tantalus He reaches for the
fruit the branch moves When he
stoops to drink the water goes
down

BEECHEY
If only he would consider the
wishes of his public rather than
pursuing his own peculiar
convictions It would be his
salvation

LESLIE
And yet my dear Beechey as his
personal troubles increase so the
quality of his painting suffers

BEECHEY
But still the man can paint

LESLIE
For sure He can paint a Haydon

JONES
The return of one prodigal is worth
more than gold

BEECHEY
An essential quality for a
prodigal sir is humility

TURNER
He is a cracked pot He’s heading
for a fall

He goes off into the house

LESLIE
Gentleman are we as one

BEECHEY
Sadly I cannot give him my
support He is not of our temper

JONES
Alas the Academy does not have
need of Haydon so much as Haydon
has need of the Academy

They leave Haydon is still visible on the distant horizon
striding towards the lake

Exterior Petworth House A moonlit night Bright lights
in the house Two men stroll along the terrace A piano is
playing inside

In the large candle-lit room a concert is being given to a
large enthusiastic audience Turner is sketching

The first of the two young ladies we saw earlier is singing a
song by Rossini (in English) She is accompanied by Miss
Coggins

Lord Egremont enters Everybody stands including Turner
but he beckons them all to sit The songs ends to much
applause

The Second Young Lady enters the room and rushes over to her
friend They giggle together

A YOUNG MAN gets up and speaks

YOUNG MAN
With Your Lordship’s permission
ladies and gentlemen our next
offering we hope is of a somewhat
more playful nature

LORD EGREMONT
Playful as you wish

YOUNG MAN
Thank you

He picks up a clarinet and proceeds to play it badly The
First Young Lady and Miss Coggins are put out Turner winces
in an amused way

FIRST YOUNG LADY

(Singing)
I’m a poor simple girl
So excuse me sir pray
I am just one and twenty
the first of next May
I never do harm
but I tend to my farm
Im up early and late
and though humble my state
I dont envy my betters
but bear ‘em good will
And I’m called Pretty Kitty -
Pretty Kitty
Pretty Kitty
The maid of the mill
I have lovers in plenty
Come hither to woo
If they will be so teasing
pray what can I do
Im good-tempered
and kind and a youth to my mind
Who is open and free
would be happy with me -
But they all are so stupid
that none of them will
Pop the question to Kitty -
Pretty Kitty -
The maid of the mill

All have been much amused throughout the course of the song
although to Turner’s wry amusement a SMALL ECCLESIASTICAL
MAN ran out in disgust at the “lovers in plenty” Loud
applause at the end

On a steamer at sea Turner his bag on his shoulder picks
his way through the passengers A FIDDLER plays a nautical
tune Turner goes up some stairs to the upper deck He
stands by an UNHAPPY YOUNG COUPLE The youth is trying to
coax his grumpy partner She is having none of it and
leaves The embarrassed young man tips his hat at Turner
and follows her Turner watches as the Fiddler concludes
Applause The Fiddler bows

Now Turner is at a busy seaside town on the seafront
Passing fish and vegetable vendors and many folk out
strolling or chatting he stops by a small house and
inspects it He reads a card in the window An ELDERLY MAN
is sitting on a stool smoking his pipe

TURNER
Good day to you sir

MAN
Good day to thee

TURNER
You be a lodgings then

MAN
It be yes

TURNER
(Indicating an upstairs
room)
This chamber ‘tis available

MAN

TURNER

Taking his time the man gets up and goes into the house He
calls to a woman who is beating a rug in the back yard
Turner looks out to sea

MAN

MRS BOOTH stops beating the rug and comes to the front door

MRS BOOTH

TURNER

TURNER

MRS BOOTH

Now all my linen is freshly aired

lay a fire for you should you
require Now sir my terms is one
guinea for the week with no meals

Turner gives her a bank note

MRS BOOTH

TURNER
‘Tis my reference and deposit
MRS BOOTH

too much
TURNER

A few minutes later she climbs the stairs holding a bowl

TURNER
Yes

MRS BOOTH

TURNER
Indeed
MRS BOOTH

welcome to join Mr Booth and I in
our kitchen

TURNER
I would not wish to impose madam

MRS BOOTH

She goes out Turner proceeds to unpack his work materials

Later Turner sits at the table by the window in Mrs Booth’s
parlour looking out to sea He is eating his supper Mrs
Booth enters with a jug

MRS BOOTH

TURNER

She pours the beer

MRS BOOTH

TURNER

Mmm
MRS BOOTH

Oh good Some folk do find
shackles too salty for their taste

TURNER

Mrs Booth giggles

Turner skips along a wide empty beach

Later Dusk In Mr and Mrs Booth’s kitchen Turner sits at
the table Mr Booth by the fireplace Mrs Booth brings in
two glasses of sherry and gives one to Turner

MRS BOOTH
It did there

MR BOOTH
Led me back to chapel

TURNER
Humans

MRS BOOTH
Humans can be dreadful cruel I
watch them boys down there in the
sands whipping them poor donkeys
Mind you you’re better off being a
donkey than them wretched souls on
the slave ships So are you
familiar with Margate Mr Mallard

TURNER
As a boy

MRS BOOTH
You come here on your holidays
then

Pause

TURNER
Schooling two years

MRS BOOTH
Oh yes Margate be famous for its
schools

TURNER
Coleman’s

MRS BOOTH
Mr Coleman I do remember he up
there by the Dane

TURNER
Back of the old town I lost two
dear friends

MRS BOOTH
I am sorry
TURNER
Scrofula
MRS BOOTH
Oh yes Terrible sickness
MR BOOTH
Aye
TURNER

Long time ago

Sadness

Another busy London street

A LADY knocks at Turner’s front door Hannah opens it

LADY
Good afternoon

HANNAH
Good afternoon madam

MRS SOMERVILLE
It is Mrs Somerville -

HANNAH
Yes You are expected

MRS SOMERVILLE
Thank you most kindly
(She enters)
What an elegant residence

In Turner’s drawing room Mrs Somerville is sitting with
Turner Snr

TURNER SNR
Have you come far Mrs Somerville

MRS SOMERVILLE
Oh yes indeed All the way from
Chelsea I took the steamer to
Westminster about an hour

TURNER SNR
Was the river busy

MRS SOMERVILLE
Extremely You can see the whole
world on the Thames

Turner enters

TURNER
Mrs Somerville

MRS SOMERVILLE
Good afternoon Mr Turner

TURNER
My apologies if I have forced you
to wait upon me

MRS SOMERVILLE
Not at all I have enjoyed a most
pleasant interlude with your
father

TURNER
You find yourself well

MRS SOMERVILLE
Passing fair thank you And you
TURNER
Indeed Doctor Somerville
likewise

MRS SOMERVILLE
Oh yes he’s much engaged in
administering to the poor veterans
Well now it’s a beautiful sunny
day Just perfect for our
experiment I have everything I
need here in my wee bag

TURNER SNR
Are we going to witness an
explosion

MRS SOMERVILLE
Goodness me no I hope not

TURNER
I’m astounded you have all your
paraphernalia contained in yon
small pouch

MRS SOMERVILLE
Indeed it is Mr Turner
Everything except God’s good
sunlight

TURNER
Daddy Mrs Somerville is a natural
philosopher

TURNER SNR
Is she now

TURNER
Mathematician astronomer
geologist

MRS SOMERVILLE
The universe is a wondrous thing
is it not Mr Turner

TURNER SNR
It is to be sure

MRS SOMERVILLE
The planets and the stars The
oceans and the tides The clouds
and the air Mountains volcanoes

TURNER SNR
The tides be subject to the effect
of the moon

MRS SOMERVILLE
Quite so The mysterious force of
gravity It is my strong belief
that all things on this earth are
connected Nothing exists in
isolation

TURNER
Indeed

TURNER SNR
The rain falls the sun shines and
the onions grow

MRS SOMERVILLE
Oh yes

TURNER
Daddy likes to affect the pretence
of being a dunce He is in fact a
man of high intellect He taught
me to read and write

MRS SOMERVILLE
Is that so

TURNER SNR
Education is an important thing

MRS SOMERVILLE
It is indeed most important for
everyone I myself am presently
engaged in the tutoring of my
children

TURNER
That is indeed commendable

Hannah has entered with the tea tray

MRS SOMERVILLE
Which is a privilege that was not
afforded to me I am an
uneducated self-taught Scotch
woman

TURNER
Mrs Somerville you are what you
are as are we Daddy
TURNER SNR
True

Hannah gives Mrs Somerville a cup of tea

MRS SOMERVILLE
Thank you And what was your
profession Mr Turner

TURNER
Daddy was the finest barber in
Covent Garden

TURNER SNR
I had some success in the business

TURNER
Wigmaker He was a master of the
razor and the brush

MRS SOMERVILLE
You’re the master of the brush now
Mr Turner

Hannah gives the old man his tea

TURNER SNR
My little lad could draw afore he
could read and write

TURNER
Sat in the corner of the shop
scratching away with the chalk and
charcoal

TURNER SNR
Id stick his pictures in the
window

TURNER

And sell ‘em all of ‘em

TURNER SNR
For two or three shillings apiece
on occasion

MRS SOMERVILLE
Do you have children yourself Mr
Turner

TURNER
I do not Mrs Somerville

Hannah and Turner Snr barely exchange looks

A little later in Turner’s studio Turner and his father are
assisting Mrs Somerville as she organises her experiment
Hannah looks on

MRS SOMERVILLE
Thank you Mr Turner Have you
ever seen a prism

TURNER SNR
I have not

She produces one from her bag

MRS SOMERVILLE
There it is

TURNER SNR
That is a thing of beauty

MRS SOMERVILLE
Shortly you shall witness a rainbow
passing through it

She places it on the window frame

TURNER
Sir Isaac Newton Daddy

MRS SOMERVILLE
Gentlemen might I request that you
close the shutters please

The proceed to do so
TURNER
Daddy Tell us when to cease Mrs
Somerville
MRS SOMERVILLE
We need to create an aperture to

strengthen the colours There

TURNER
Daddy

They stop closing the shutters

MRS SOMERVILLE
Let us put the paper in place

TURNER
Daddy some tacks for Mrs
Somerville

MRS SOMERVILLE
No no tacks Mr Turner The
metal could contaminate the
experiment A wee nub of wax
Paper

Taking the wax from a small tin she attaches a sheet of
paper to an easel they have placed on the table Then she
tears off a tiny corner of paper

TURNER
And what is the purpose of the
small piece of paper

MRS SOMERVILLE
I shall cover the bottom half of
the needle so that it is not
exposed

She now takes a hammer out of her bag Then she conceals the
needle in a piece of cloth

TURNER
And what is it you are about now
Mrs Somerville

MRS SOMERVILLE
You’1l have to wait and see won’t
you

TURNER
Daddy I wager that is the first
time you’ve witnessed a hammer
being produced from a lady’s
reticule

TURNER SNR
For certain ‘tis

Mrs Somerville now hammers the folded cloth vigorously
TURNER

You have the arm of a blacksmith
Mrs Somerville

MRS SOMERVILLE
There now That has thrown all
those wee particles into chaos

TURNER SNR
Particles into chaos

TURNER
Mrs Somerville what is the element
contained within the violet light
such as magnetises the material

MRS SOMERVILLE
That is what as yet Mr Turner I
do not know

TURNER
The majesty of mystery

MRS SOMERVILLE

Indeed Now let us allow nature
to take its course Although we
will have to adjust the position of
the easel from time to time

TURNER
Indeed As mighty Apollo moves
across his heavenly tract

MRS SOMERVILLE
Yes

Moments later The Turners show Mrs Somerville into their
gallery

TURNER SNR
Three steps down Mrs Somerville

TURNER
Take care

MRS SOMERVILLE
Oh my goodness me Mr Turner I
am quite overwhelmed

TURNER
Do as you wish View as you wish

Mrs Somerville looks at two paintings of ships
MRS SOMERVILLE
Oh my These are breathtaking
are they not My dear late father
would have much appreciated them

TURNER
A naval man I believe

MRS SOMERVILLE
Indeed he was a vice admiral

TURNER SNR
We have ‘The Battle of Trafalgar’
over here

TURNER
Was he there your father

MRS SOMERVILLE
No he was at Camperdown

TURNER SNR
Lord Nelson’s flagship ‘The
Victory’
They look at the painting

MRS SOMERVILLE
Indeed

TURNER
It’s a sketch for the painting
Commissioned by the King

MRS SOMERVILLE
Is that so

TURNER
Two years in the making He didn’t
like it

MRS SOMERVILLE
Did he not

TURNER
TURNER SNR
Too good for him

They laugh

MRS SOMERVILLE
Two years It takes me only half
an hour to paint a picture

TURNER SNR
So you are an artist Mrs
Somerville

MRS SOMERVILLE
I don’t think we can quite use that
term in the presence of Mr Turner

TURNER
Nevertheless Daddy Mrs
Somerville is a fine
watercolourist

MRS SOMERVILLE
You flatter me What an epic
storm

TURNER
Rock crushing a house in
Switzerland Calais sands women
digging for bait I don’t care for
that much

MRS SOMERVILLE
My What have we here

TURNER
It’s Hannibal crossing the Alps

TURNER SNR
Do you see the elephant

MRS SOMERVILLE
An elephant

TURNER SNR
He’s in there somewhere

MRS SOMERVILLE
Are you teasing me Mr Turner

TURNER SNR
By no means madam Can you find
him

Mrs Somerville scrutinises the painting very closely

MRS SOMERVILLE
Well no I cannot

TURNER SNR
There he is

He points out the tiny elephant in the distance She laughs

TURNER
Daddy’s little jest

MRS SOMERVILLE
‘Tis a terrifying scene

TURNER SNR
The elements dwarfing the
elephants

TURNER
Hubris

Back in the studio Hannah watches from a distance as Mrs
Somerville with the aid of the needle floating in a bowl of
water demonstrates her experiment to the Turners

MRS SOMERVILLE
There Shall I make it do a wee
dance So the end of the needle
that was exposed to the violet
light has produced a magnetic north
pole

TURNER SNR
Like a compass

MRS SOMERVILLE
Exactly so Whereas Mr Turner
had I done the same experiment
using the red end of the spectrum
this needle would not have been
magnetised I have from time to
time attempted it with the green
and the blue and it has succeeded
on occasion but not consistently

TURNER
Colour is contradictory

MRS SOMERVILLE
Well is it Mr Turner Colour is
absolute

TURNER
Sublime but contradictory yet
harmonious

MRS SOMERVILLE
You are a man of great vision Mr
Turner The universe is chaotic
and you make us see it In natural
philosophy nothing can ever be
proved only disproved

TURNER
The purity of your prism the
contamination of my palette
Natural light blackness White is
the power of good black is the
devil

At the Royal Academy The lecture theatre Turner addresses
a full house Mostly men a few women Turner Snr sits on
the front row next to an ELDERLY MAN with an ear trumpet

TURNER
Transparent bodies depend so much
upon what is opposed to them
having no colour that they take
every on e offered Water often
possesses colour but colour is not
imparted to its reflections or
refractions like a coloured glass
when everything seen is vitiated by
that colour Even the purest
mirror gives a tone to the sky and
as the colour is increased it
destroys all the colour of nature
by its by its own dullness
while water often seems to
challenge the sky for
brightness and when possessing
colour

Turner Snr coughs

TURNER
its reflections of objects
appear more possible

(MORE )

TURNER (CONTD)
In short their effects are like
their qualities One repels the
immediate ray

Turner Snr continues his coughing which gets worse His
neighbour pats him on the back

TURNER
the other absorbs it The one
transparent while the mirror is
opaque How can they appear the
same

He looks concerned about his father

Turner is painting in his studio Through the wind ow he
can see his father outside in the yard chopping wood Hannah
takes a chamber pot to the outside lavatory The old man
stops his labours He is obviously unwell Turner looks
concerned

Later Turner Snr is mulling (grinding) yellow paint Turner
is at work on the same canvas as in the previous scene

TURNER
Daddy cease your labour Go and
sit in your chair

TURNER SNR
I can’t leave this

TURNER
Itll keep for the half-hour Go
and peruse your newspaper

The old man takes no notice Then he accidentally drops a
palette knife on the floor Turner goes over and picks it

up

TURNER
Do not stoop Go and rest your
bones

The old man looks at his son defiant but helpless

Turner walks briskly down another bustling London street

Turner’s house In his workshop Turner Snr is stretching
canvas He is coughing badly This gets worse he stops
working and staggers out of the room

Turner enters his house and without having taken off his
hat and coat he rushes upstairs to his father’s bedroom
Comforted by Hannah the old man is sitting on the side of
the bed inhaling steam from a bowl

TURNER
What’s occurring

HANNAH
He’s struggling

TURNER
Are you rattling Come on bring
it up

Later Turner Snr is lying in bed He is rambling Turner
sits by him Hannah hovers in the doorway

TURNER SNR
No indeed not sir I shall I
shall tell her I will tell her I
ought to have told her afore
Years ago

TURNER
Who do you speak of Daddy

TURNER SNR
Afore they took her away
Eastertide the good Lord took her
from us We did not do right by
her Poor woman

TURNER
She was a lunatic We didn’t have
no choice Daddy She made our
life a living hell

TURNER SNR
She was your mother curse her
Show her due respect boy The
bitch
Pause

TURNER SNR
My little lad

TURNER
Daddy

Turner Snr dies Tears well up in Turner’s eyes

Fraught Hannah comes and stands near Turner

In small boat by a river bank Turner is fishing with a rod
and line He sits still sad and reflective

Some rough outdoor corner of London Turner strides past men
and women of all ages and classes mostly sitting They look
as though they are waiting for something

Turner ascends a rickety wooden staircase passing a couple
of men

He enters a brothel The BROTHEL KEEPER a middle-aged
woman is sitting on a sofa A YOUNG WOMAN sits in the
corner

BROTHEL KEEPER
Good afternoon sir

TURNER
Good day to you madam

BROTHEL KEEPER
It’s been a long while ain’t it

TURNER
Yeah

BROTHEL KEEPER
May I offer you a refreshment

TURNER
No thank you kindly

BROTHEL KEEPER
Champagne No mind sir I regret
all my lovely girls are occupied
But we do have young Eliza here
who I do not believe you’ve had the
pleasure of previous She has a
pleasing countenance when she
smiles

PROSTITUTE
Good day sir

TURNER
Good day to you miss

BROTHEL KEEPER
Show the gentleman to your chamber
dear

PROSTITUTE
It’s this way sir

Turner follows her out

In a corridor they pass a fully-clad man and two half-dressed
women

Then in her room the Prostitute stands with one foot on the
bed She is wearing a red stocking

Turner puts his bag down The Prostitute shows him her bare
bottom

TURNER
Very fine

PROSTITUTE
I do extras

She raises the front of her skirt

TURNER
No no no no Remove the bodice
(She does so)
Expose your breasts
(She starts to take her
breasts out)
No no No Lay upon the bed

She lies on her back and complies with Turner’s instructions
as he manoeuvres her into position

TURNER
Part your legs Crook your knee
Right arm as thus Hand upon the
head No As in despair

He goes to the end of the bed and checks her pose Then he
gets a chair and places it in the same position Having
checked the pose again he takes a pencil and sketchbook from
his bag and starts to draw her Pause

TURNER
Eliza or Liza

PROSTITUTE
Eliza Or Liza

TURNER
Your age

PROSTITUTE

Twenty-two sir

TURNER
Twenty-two

Turner now breaks down Uncontrollable tears grow into a
painful howl of despair Without breaking her pose the
prostitute watches him

PROSTITUTE
Would you like something to drink
sir

TURNER

(Still crying)
No thank you miss Now expose
your breasts

She sits up and starts to undo the laces of her corset
Turner continues to draw her

Hannah is in her bedroom sitting by the window She reads a
book with a magnifying glass

Turner is painting ‘Death on a Pale Horse’

In the drawing room Hannah returns her book to a glass-
fronted bookcase and chooses another book Turner joins
her Then he takes her from behind the two of them standing
up fully-clothed pushing against the bookcase It is over
quickly He leaves Her face shows pain and joy

Silhouetted against the sky Turner strides along a cliff

top In the distance a tiny ancient chapel perches on a hill-
top A pack of wild horses emerge from nowhere and follow
Turner as he descends over the cliff top
Now as the sun sets over the
drawing the view

And on yet another cliff top
of birds fly by

Margate the sea front

Turner makes his way past the

sea Turner sits on a hillside

Turner watches the sky A flock

bustling marketeers and

townsfolk He arrives at Mrs Booth’s house and knocks at the
door After a few moments she answers She is dressed in
black
MRS BOOTH
Good day sir
TURNER
Madam
MRS BOOTH

MRS BOOTH

Oh Mr Mallard

TURNER

MRS BOOTH

They go in

A little later In her parlour Mrs Booth is putting out a
pot of tea as Turner is coming down the stairs He has taken
off his jacket He comes into the room

MRS BOOTH
Mr Mallard Everything
satisfactory in your chamber

TURNER
Most agreeable

MRS BOOTH

MRS BOOTH
Now that I do remember Mr
Mallard And will you take a
biscuit

TURNER
No thank you madam I purchased
a potato on the boat

MRS BOOTH

TURNER
It was somewhat turbulent

MRS BOOTH
I shall leave you to take your
refreshment

TURNER
Madam may I apprehend you with my
condolences

MRS BOOTH

TURNER

the loss of your dear departed man

MRS BOOTH

TURNER

MRS BOOTH

TURNER
A life-saver

MRS BOOTH
Aye He did save many a life but
in the end he could not save his
own We never did find him poor
soul My boy were eight year old
when he did lose his father

TURNER
I was eight when I lost my little
sister
MRS BOOTH
I am sorry Well ‘tis the way of
things
(Pause )

You still making your nice little
pictures Mr Mallard

TURNER
(Amused)
Mmmm

MRS BOOTH

Back in London Turner enters busily through his front door

things Hannah comes in

HANNAH

HANNAH

He doesn’t reply She shrugs and goes out picking up his
umbrella as she goes and putting it in the hall stand

His bag on his shoulder Turner ascends a grand staircase
and enters a large hall the walls of which are covered with
paintings Men mostly in hats and coats are standing or
sitting or up ladders adding the finishing touches to their
paintings This is Varnishing Day at the Royal Academy

Turner moves into the corridor where Carew Soane and
Stothard are inspecting a marble portrait on a plinth

TURNER
Carew This your man

CAREW
‘Tis he

TURNER
Sports an elegant nostril does he

SOANE
Splendid nostrils

Thank you kindly

STOTHARD
(Brandishing his ear

What did you say

TURNER
Elegant pair of nostrils Mr
Stothard

STOTHARD
Oh yes Yes indeed

Carew laughs uproariously Turner moves on

A few minutes later in the main gallery The Academicians
stand about chatting quietly Constable sitting on a
stool continues to apply red paint to his canvas

Armed with a paintbrush Turner walks briskly up to his own
grey picture puts a bold red blob right in the middle and
leaves

The Academicians gather round the painting Constable gets
up astonished

SHEE
Why on earth would he go and do
that

EASTLAKE

I believe Mr Turner knows well
enough what he’s doing

SHEE
You think so He’s ruined a
masterpiece

JONES
I think not

General consternation and reaction Carew laughs
uproariously Constable puts on his coat

CONSTABLE
He’s been here and fired a gun

He storms out of the gallery The following is mixed in with
general murmur whilst just as Constable leaves Haydon
enters and looks round the whole exhibition Carew
continues to laugh

SHEE
No no

BEECHEY
John you must not upset yourself
like this

SHEE
The man’s impossible I mean why
would he go and destroy a perfectly
good painting

ROBERTS
Sheer mockery

MAN
My sympathy’s with Constable

BEECHEY
He’s got a damn fine picture here
and he’s made a damn mockery of it

EASTLAKE
There’s method in the madness
gentlemen

SHEE
If that is method it is pure
madness

MAN

But what is it

SHEE
Do stop that prattling laughter
Mr Carew

Carew doesn’t stop laughing
CALLCOTT

I wager we’ve not seen the end of
this

SHEE
He may surprise us yet

In the corridor Haydon bumps into Turner who is just coming
out of the ante-room

TURNER
Haydon Hey

Turner returns to the main gallery Watched by all and

using his forefinger his thumb and a cloth he turns the red
blob into a buoy

SHEE
Ah Mr Turner

BEECHEY
We were just wondering if

CALLCOTT
I said he wasn’t finished

MAN
It’s a buoy

SHEE
Bravo Bravo

General celebration and applause Turner gives them all a
sardonic look and leaves

In the ante-room we are looking at a painting of a donkey

PICKERSGILL
Can you explain your rendition

HAYDON
It needs no explanation sir ‘Tis
our Redeemer’s conveyance into
Jerusalem plain as day

PICKERSGILL
Blasphemy

Turner has returned

TURNER
You faring well Mr Haydon

HAYDON
This will be the finish of me

He storms out

TURNER
Fifty pounds

Turner shakes his head and shares the moment with Soane who
is adjacent

Haydon marches into the main gallery He goes up to Leslie
who is standing with Eastlake and Callcott

HAYDON
Thank you sir Thank you sir for
your charity

LESLIE
Haydon

HAYDON
You have been most kind Most kind
in your placement You have
finished me You might as well have
taken my painting and put it in the
outhouse Better yet taken it out
of this building and thrown it in
the Fleet

A crowd gathers Much of the following dialogue overlaps

SHEE
Please lower your voice Mr
Haydon

LESLIE

Haydon I am hard hard set to
understand your indignation

SHEE
Mr Haydon

HAYDON
And as as for you as for you

HAYDON (0S)
His his pictures look as if they

Academy floor

HAYDON

SHEE
This would be one of the many
reasons why you were never accepted

Soane and Pickersgill join the group around Haydon

HAYDON

quarter of a century doing
everything in his power to malign
me

SHEE

PICKERSGILL
At least my work does not represent
self-portrait as ass

SHEE
Mr Pickersgill

HAYDON
Give me those

Haydon knocks Pickersgill’s hat off A general struggle

ensues

HAYDON
Unhand me

SHEE
Remove this man

HAYDON
(shouting)
You swines You swines

Turner quietly leaves the gallery

SOANE
Mr Haydon sir with deep regret I
must inform you that I am on my way
to the porters unless you feel free
to leave of your own volition

HAYDON
Shh shh

SOANE
Please sir

HAYDON
Stretch me no longer on this rough
world I am done with you

He makes his way through the crowd and leaves

General discussion and hubbub

A little later in the ante-room Watched by a large group
of amused and enthralled Academicians Turner works further
on his painting ‘Staffa’ vigorously stabbing the canvas
with his brush wiping it with a cloth spitting at the
painting and blowing brown powder at it

In a rocky mountainous landscape Turner walks and climbs
and stops to survey the scene

At Margate Turner wends his way through the busy vendors and
passers by on the seafront He arrives at Mrs Booth’s house
where she is cleaning her windows He makes her jump with
surprise They exchange greetings and enter the house

In Mrs Booth’s parlour Turner is seated on the sofa Mrs
Booth by the window They are drinking sherry
MRS BOOTH
Hmm Tis nice to have a bit of
company for a change So you had a
good walk then Werent too chippy
up there by Reculver

TURNER
Somewhat blowy and the wind did
kick up some white horses

MRS BOOTH
Can do this time of year In
summertime though tis a lovely
calm spot for a picnic up there by
the Two Sisters But in wintertime
I have known the whole of Marine
Terrace down here without a pane
of glass left in the entire place
Oh the glaziers do get rich

TURNER
(laughs)
Hmm

MRS BOOTH
When Mr Booth and I moved in here
we had the whole place polished up
spick and span ready for our first
visitors and the wind did blow and
the sea come up We had broken
glass everywhere It were terrible

TURNER
Mrs Booth would you be so kind as
to look out of the window

MRS BOOTH
Where What am I looking at

TURNER
From the tip of your nose to the
bridge to the curve of your brow
you put me in mind of a Greek
sculpture Im familiar with of
Aphrodite goddess of love

MRS BOOTH
No No ones ever said that about
my nose before This old snout

TURNER
Hmm

MRS BOOTH
Truth to tell my eyes arent so
good these days so when I do look
in the looking-glass I be glad I
cannot see so well

TURNER
When I peruse myself in the looking-
glass I see a gargoyle

MRS BOOTH
Now you be fishing for
compliments and my old Ma used to
say them that fish for compliments
dont get none Besides tis
whats within a person that do
matter I do not know you Mr
Mallard and Im sure there be
things about you that are beyond my
understanding But I believe you to
be a man of great spirit and fine
feeling

TURNER
Mrs Booth you are a woman of
profound beauty

MRS BOOTH
Mr Mallard I am lost for words

TURNER
Hmm

A long pause A charged moment

Later Holding a lantern Mrs Booth climbs the stairs She
carries Turner’s boots

MRS BOOTH
Good night Mr Mallard sir Ive
cleaned your boots foree Theyre
by the door here

She puts them outside his door which he opens
TURNER

Mrs Booth I thank you for a most
convivial evening

MRS BOOTH
I do thank you too sir

Turner pulls her towards him They kiss

She takes him by his hand and leads him into her bedroom and
closes her door

Next morning Turner leaves Mrs Booth’s house As he walks
along the seafront the sun rises over the bay

Dusk On a ship in the pouring rain A MARINER is tying
Turner to the mast with a long rope

MARINER
(shouting)
If I may be so bold as to say
mate as I see it youre a loose
cannon rolling round the deck

Turner laughs

Now a snowstorm rages It is night Turner absorbs the full
force of the experience

Mrs Booth’s parlour Turner is sprawled on the sofa a
DOCTOR is listening to Turner’s chest as he inhales and
wheezes

DR PRICE
And out

Turner coughs
DR PRICE
Cover yourself up Good man Well
Mr Mallard is suffering from
bronchitis

MRS BOOTH
Oh there

DR PRICE
For which we prescribe the three
Bs bed balsam and broth

MRS BOOTH
Oh

DR PRICE
To be administered in this case by
the fourth B the admirable Mrs
Booth

Mrs Booth laughs

DR PRICE
Thank you Now Mrs Booth if you
would be so good as to come up to
the house after four I shall have
the balsam prepared

MRS BOOTH
Indeed I shall sir

DR PRICE
Good day Mr Mallard Rest the
body sir and the soul shall find

solace

MRS BOOTH
I do thank ye Doctor Let me show
ye out

DR PRICE

Good day to you Mrs Booth
Mrs Booth sees Dr Price out

MRS BOOTH
Good day to you sir

Turner coughs heavily into his handkerchief

In his studio Turner is painting “Snow Storm - Steam-Boat
off a Harbour’s Mouth”

Now he enters his gallery A middle-aged man and a young man
are looking at a painting - “Slavers throwing overboard the
Dead and Dying - Typhoon coming on” They are JOHN RUSKIN
and his FATHER

TURNER
Gentlemen

RUSKIN
Ah Mr Turner My father and I
are marvelling at this glorious
work Er might I be correct in
remembering that we had the good
fortune of viewing it at the
Academy last summer

TURNER
Indeed

RUSKIN
Well I must say it is no less
impressive on its second viewing
Perhaps even more so Is it not
Father

RUSKINS FATHER
Indeed so I recall it provoked
much heated and stimulating
discussion long after our viewing

TURNER
It did not sell

RUSKINS FATHER
Indeed not

TURNER
No Mr Ruskin

RUSKINS FATHER
Im astonished

RUSKIN
But it is a masterpiece

TURNER
Thackeray reviles it
RUSKIN
How so
TURNER
Sublime or ridiculous he says
RUSKIN
Well perhaps he should make up his
mind
TURNER

He has a sharp and cynical tongue

RUSKIN
There is no place for cynicism in
the reviewing of art

TURNER
Hmm tis of no consequence
RUSKIN
Quite
TURNER
It is purchasable
RUSKIN
Enticing
RUSKINS FATHER
Perhaps
TURNER
(indicating)

Typhus epidemic amongst the cargo -
slaves Die on board - no
insurance Sling em in the drink -
drowned dead - cash

RUSKIN
I am struck by the column of bright
white placed precisely off centre
here applied over the darkened
background impasto contrasting with
the scarlet and ochre hues in the
upper left corner which in turn
contrasts with the presence of God
revealing to us that hope exists
even in the most turbulent and
illimitable of deaths

Hannah has sat down During the above speech she yawns and
scratches herself

TURNER
Bluebottles

HANNAH
Eh

TURNER

Up in the muslin Knock ‘em out

HANNAH
Well I didnt put ‘em there

She gets up and goes out

RUSKIN
Would it not sit splendidly above
the fireplace in the library
Father

RUSKINS FATHER
Er it would but I fear it may be
beyond our purse John

RUSKIN
No

TURNER
Im sure some arrangement can be
come to sir

Hannah returns holding a large stick from which she draws a
sword

HANNAH
Mind your heads

She pokes the ceiling drape with the sword

TURNER
Youre just Youre just knocking
‘em up and down Scrape ‘em out
No look Now youve just knocked
it over there

Bemused the Ruskins watch this operation

Margate Turner sketches boats outside Mrs Booth’s house
She arrives with a shopping basket and joins him for a few
moments

Mrs Booth is sweeping her front doorway Turner comes down
the stairs They both look out at the view

MRS BOOTH
There Tis a nice day foree

He kisses her

TURNER
Au revoir madame

She giggles Turner leaves immediately reappearing going
the other way

TURNER
Tother way

He disappears A woman passes

MRS BOOTH
Morning Mrs Stokes

MRS STOKES
Morning

Turner and Mrs Booth walk down some seaside steps in Margate

Suddenly Turner collapses Mrs Booth rushes to his rescue

Turner is in bed in Mrs Booth’s house Dr Price is
unbuttoning Turner’s shirt watched by Mrs Booth who is
standing at the end of the bed
TURNER
Dr Price Mrs Booth has summoned
you here under false pretences

MRS BOOTH
Shh Let the doctor do his work

DR PRICE
Breathe in

Turner does so and coughs

DR PRICE
Breathe out

Turner does so

DR PRICE
Have you been exerting yourself
unduly Mr Mallard

TURNER
No more than is usual sir
DR PRICE
Remind me again what is your
profession
TURNER

Master of Chancery

DR PRICE
Breathe in

Turner does so

DR PRICE
Forgive me sir but I beg to
differ Breathe out

Turner does so

DR PRICE
I suggest that you are Mr Turner
the illustrious painter and I am
greatly honoured to make your
acquaintance

TURNER
Hmm

DR PRICE
My apologies to you both but rest
assured that my discretion can be
relied upon

As the doctor turns his back on them to attend to his bag

Turner and Mrs Booth exchange startled looks
of consternation

DR PRICE

Now allow me to examine your eyes
The eyes of a master Open wide

(He inspects Turner’s eye)
Hmm-mm Look up Hmm Mr
Turner you are suffering from a
disorder of the heart There is no
immediate cause for concern Mrs
Booth but he will have to be
careful

MRS BOOTH
Oh dear

DR PRICE
Live moderately sir and you shall
enjoy a long and fruitful life
Exert yourself unduly and you will
go to an early grave

MRS BOOTH
Oh dear There now

TURNER
Hmm

and mouth words

In Turners house Sarah Danby and Evelina stand in the
drawing room They are dressed in black Hannah stands with
them Enter Turner He joins them hands clasped behind his

back They all remain standing Pause

SARAH DANBY
Good day sir

TURNER
Hmm

SARAH DANBY
Have you nothing to say to me
TURNER
I am most sorry for your loss

EVELINA
Our loss Father

SARAH DANBY
Your own dear daughters funeral

EVELINA
Indeed

TURNER
I did not find myself in the city

SARAH DANBY
As ever sir painting your
ridiculous shipwrecks

TURNER
Hmm

SARAH DANBY
Have you no feelings Speak

Long pause

SARAH DANBY
Come Evelina there is nothing
here for us

Sarah sweeps out She now has a walking stick and is
limping Evelina accompanies her followed by Hannah

Alone

Turner sobs

A steamer glides through the sea Turner stands at the

stern

Night

surveying the view

Mrs Booth and Turner are in her bed

MRS BOOTH
Youre tired my dear

TURNER
Hmm

MRS BOOTH
Tis too much of a strain for you
these days trawling back and forth
on that old steamer every time you
wants to see me And even when
they finish building that new
railway we none of us do know what
lies ahead I have bethought me of
a plan and heres what we must do
If you will find a little house for
us somewhere by your beloved River
Thames but not too far from London
Town with good solid wooden
floors nice bright light for you
to work by then I will buy the
lease I can sell this house I
think we would be happy The two
of us

Sunset on the River Thames The HMS Temeraire is being towed
by a steam tug

Turner Stanfield and Roberts are in a small boat being
rowed by two men The artists are swigging beer from stone
bottles

TURNER
There she is

STANFIELD
The saucy ‘Temeraire’

TURNER
Going to her death I fear

ROBERTS
Shes served her time

STANFIELD
The auctioneers hammer has struck
that final blow

TURNER
Indeed

STANFIELD
If not for her the ‘Victory’ might
never again have seen our shores

ROBERTS
Aye nor the body of Lord Nelson

TURNER
The little saviour of Trafalgar

STANFIELD
They say five thousand oaks went
into making that ship

ROBERTS
Now shes destined to be reduced to
five thousand tables and chairs

TURNER
To be sat on by five thousand fat
arses

Roberts Stanfield and Turner laugh
STANFIELD
Gentlemen a toast Raise your pot
of grog To the fine fighting
‘Temeraire

They all raise their drinks

TURNER
The ‘Temeraire’

ROBERTS
‘Temeraire’

TURNER

Heres to her
They drink

ROBERTS
A ghost of the past

TURNER
No Rabbie The past is the past
Were observing the future Smoke
Iron Steam

STANFIELD
Shed make a fine subject for you
to paint Turner

TURNER
Oh is that so Stanny I shall
cogitate upon it Thank you
Yeh yeh

The others laugh

In his studio Turner is working on ‘The Fighting Temeraire’
Hannah enters

HANNAH
Its that Mr Haydon

Turner growls

HANNAH
Hes brought a cold blast of air in
with him

She goes out Turner continues working

A few minutes later Turner enters his drawing room where
Haydon is waiting

TURNER
Mr Haydon To what do I owe the
honour of your presence this
morning

HAYDON
I trust that this is not an
inconvenience to you Turner

Turner growls

HAYDON
Now will you accept ten pounds

TURNER
Ten pounds sir

HAYDON
I wish to be free of the debt It
weighs heavily upon me

TURNER
Sir you owe me fifty pounds

HAYDON
Manchester Leeds Newcastle I
have been giving my lecture
(MORE)
HAYDON (CONTD)
Edinburgh Fair city Only in
London is my genius not
appreciated Consider this as a
statement of intent

TURNER
Mr Haydon pray be seated

HAYDON
I had rather not I do not wish to
prevail upon your time more than is
necessary

TURNER
And I prevail upon you sir to
take a seat

HAYDON
Well where would you have me sit

TURNER
Wherever you wish

HAYDON
Will this suffice

TURNER
Indeed Mr Haydon do you still
find yourself in a position of
impecuniousness

Haydon has sat down

HAYDON

Impecunity Turner that has been
my constant state these thirty
years

(Looking round)
You are most well-appointed here I
do not recall the last time we had
as much coal in our scuttle as
that I fear we shall be burning
our furniture this winter

TURNER
Does Mrs Haydon find herself
faring well

HAYDON
She does not She has not
recovered I fear that she may
never do so

Pause

Hannah registers this She is standing by the door

TURNER
What ails her sir

HAYDON

We have buried five children
TURNER

Indeed
HAYDON

Paddington Old Churchyard They
remove the soil extract the
coffins dig the hole deeper then
re-inter the coffins with another
atop Five times she has had to
suffer that indignity

TURNER
Tis pitiable

HAYDON
It is pitiable Turner You have
never had to endure the loss of a
child

TURNER
I have not sir

HAYDON
A dying child tis a potent
subject for a painting is it not
And what is your present endeavour
Turner

TURNER
Marine piece

HAYDON
A marine piece Do not you tire of
boats and the fiery firmament

TURNER
I do not sir

HAYDON
(Laughing drily)
Sometimes I consider it might make
a better course for me were I to
set light to the house
(MORE)

HAYDON (CONTD)
with my wife my surviving children
and myself within it Then they
would no longer be saddled with me

TURNER
Your pain is your own sir Do not
inflict it upon your loved ones

HAYDON
Will you take my ten pounds

TURNER
I will not sir You are free of
your debt

HAYDON
Free How so

TURNER
Tis expunged

HAYDON
Er - no sir I do not come here a
seeker after charity or pity

TURNER
You have neither charity nor pity
nor debt

HAYDON
I do not wish it in such a
circumstance

TURNER
Mr Haydon I am much preoccupied
Me damsel be so kind as to escort
the gentleman into the street
Good day to you sir

HAYDON
This does not sit well with me
Turner

Hannah shows Haydon out of the front door He stumbles down
the steps

HAYDON
Damn his eyes

Hannah watches him go then closes the door

Turner and Jones arrive at a large well-appointed house
Turner raps on the door with his umbrella

In the hall of the house which is the home of the Ruskins
FOOTMAN opens the door

TURNER
Turner and Jones

Ruskin’s Father bustles into the hall to greet them

RUSKINS FATHER
Mr Turner Captain Jones Its a
pleasure to see you

TURNER
Mr Ruskin

JONES
Good evening to you

RUSKINS FATHER
I trust you had a pleasant journey

TURNER
Indeed You find yourself well
sir

Now there are two footmen They take the guests’ coats
RUSKINS FATHER
I do indeed thank you Pride of

place Mr Turner

He is referring to ‘Slavers’ which now hangs on the wall
They all turn to look at it

TURNER
Oh

JONES
Ah splendid

RUSKINS FATHER
As though the house was built
around it

Turner mutters politely

RUSKINS FATHER
Please come through Come through
They all proceed through a doorway Turner gestures for
Jones to go first

TURNER
Jonesy

In the Ruskin’s drawing room Turner Jones Roberts
Stanfield John Ruskin and his father and MOTHER are all
sitting in a formal circle

RUSKINS MOTHER
My good husband is of the opinion
that the gooseberry prefers the
colder climate whereas I consider
that all fruits benefit from the
warmth

JONES
My dear late mother always insisted
that both the gooseberry and the
rhubarb favour the colder climes of
our victorious isles

RUSKINS FATHER
I do not doubt that the gooseberry
for its preference may enjoy the
warm However I am convinced that
a cold start promotes the more
vigorous specimen

RUSKIN
Are we not to take as empirical
evidence our many expeditions to
the warmer climes of the
Mediterranean where we do not
exactly encounter an abundance of
gooseberries

RUSKINS FATHER
(laughing)
Ha Indeed

ROBERTS
Exactly so I did not myself savour
many gooseberries in Jerusalem

RUSKINS MOTHER
Ah the Holy City Mister Turner

ROBERTS
And yet we do enjoy fine
gooseberries in Scotland do we
not Mr Ruskin

RUSKINS FATHER
Aye and no better a cold start
than a good Scottish sun

Stanfield and Roberts laugh

ROBERTS
Exactly that

STANFIELD
Surely regardless of how cold the
start of the life of the gooseberry
might be it is almost certainly
destined for a warm ending

JONES
To which we have all borne witness
in Mrs Ruskins excellent
gooseberry pie

A general murmur of agreement

RUSKINS MOTHER
I thank you Captain Jones

STANFIELD
Hear hear

RUSKIN
May I propose as a topic for
discussion the question as to the
depiction of the seas and the
oceans in pictorial art

Turner groans

RUSKIN
Now I I appreciate that I am
honoured to be in the presence of
two of our most distinguished
marine painters Mr Turner and Mr
Stanfield Not to forget er
Captain Jones and Mr Roberts of
course whose er realisations are
confined to mere naked terra firma
exemplary though they are

TURNER
Hmm

RUSKIN
Erm My point being that alas I
find myself harbouring a perhaps
rather controversial opinion
regarding the long deceased Claude

JONES
Indeed

RUSKIN
I am afraid so Captain Jones I
must confess that I find his
rendering of the sea rather
insipid dull and uninspiring

STANFIELD
That is an extremely bold
statement young Mr Ruskin

RUSKIN
Thank you very much

TURNER
Claude was a man of his time

RUSKIN
My point exactly Mr Turner but
that time is now long past When I
experience a modern masterpiece
such as yours I am struck by the
clarity with which you have
captured the moment Take for
example your ‘Slave Ship Slavers
Throwing Overboard the Dead and
Dying - Typhoon Coming On by
which I have the good fortune to be
greeted every morning on my way in
to my meagre breakfast The impact
of the foaming brine incarnadine
consuming those unfortunate Negro
slaves never ceases to quicken the
beat of my heart Yet when I gaze
upon a work of Claude I find myself
enduring nothing more than a mere
collection of precise brushstrokes
which instil in me no sense of awe
whatsoever let alone the sea

JONES
Preposterous I do beg your
pardon Mrs Ruskin

Mrs Ruskin nods
TURNER

Claude Lorrain was a genius
JONES

Quite so
RUSKIN

I sense an excess of modesty in
Mr Turner and there is no need
for such humility

STANFIELD
Mr Ruskin sir to conjecture upon
the matter of seascape painting is
one thing but to stand amongst the
elements and to experience and to
interpret what one sees that is
something quite other

JONES
Hear hear

ROBERTS
Quite

RUSKIN

Well that is as it may be

TURNER
Claude painted from the land
looking at the sea becalmed by the
harbour

RUSKIN
Oh indeed

RUSKINS MOTHER
‘Bless the Lord oh my soul who
layeth the beams of his chambers in
the waters and walketh upon the
wings of the wind

RUSKIN
How apt Mother

RUSKINS MOTHER
Thank you John When my son was
but a small boy he was overheard
to remark that waves of sea are
indeed lovely to watch but they are
always ‘coming or gone never in
any taken shape to be seen for a
second

RUSKIN
(Joining in)
For a second
(Laughs )
I find myself marvelling at my own
wealth of perception even at the
early age of four

RUSKINS MOTHER
Quite so

TURNER
Mr Ruskin can I pose you a
somewhat conundrous question

RUSKIN
Ah please do Mr Turner

He gets up and proceeds to the window where he stands
expectantly

TURNER
To which do you find yourself the
more partial a steak and kidney
pie or a veal and ham pie

The other artists laugh uproariously

RUSKIN
I must confess Mr Turner that I
find myself quite unable to answer
your question with the precision
that I would wish

Somewhere in the countryside a railway train races past a
fascinated Turner the engine belching its steam high into
the sky

In his studio Turner is painting ‘Rain Steam and Speed -
The Great Western Railway’ Hannah enters and gives hima
glass of sherry Then she examines the painting for a few
moments A little baffled she looks at Turner then leaves

At the Royal Academy at the foot of the grand staircase Sir
Martin Archer Shee the President bows to the young QUEEN
VICTORIA

SHEE
Your Majesty

The Queen and Shee ascend the stairs followed by PRINCE
ALBERT and a SMALL ENTOURAGE A few minutes later they are
in the main gallery The Queen and Prince Albert are
inspecting paintings

She stops by one canvas

QUEEN VICTORIA
Terribly flat Dull

PRINCE ALBERT
Its rather dark isnt it

QUEEN VICTORIA
Hmm-mm

PRINCE ALBERT
Sir Martin

SHEE

SHEE

Shee turns to Callcott and Eastlake behind him

EASTLAKE

Shee turns back to Albert

SHEE
MR John Ferneley sir

PRINCE ALBERT
Ah Mr Ferneley

QUEEN VICTORIA
Hmm Ah

Queen Victoria turns spots a painting and reacts She walks
towards it

She stops by it It is one of Turner’s paintings
(‘Whalers’)
She shakes her head Albert joins her

QUEEN VICTORIA
Turner

PRINCE ALBERT
He is clearly losing his eyesight

QUEEN VICTORIA
And this one is vile

Victoria moves to the next Turner (‘Sunrise with Sea
Monsters’)

PRINCE ALBERT
Ah unglaublich

QUEEN VICTORIA
Was ist das

PRINCE ALBERT
Ich weiB es nicht

QUEEN VICTORIA
A dirty yellow mess

They move on followed by their entourage Turner is

revealed in an adjacent doorway having overheard the Queen
and the Prince’s conversation Horrified he leaves

In another gallery somewhere two middle-aged GENTLEMEN ART
CRITICS are looking at Turner’s work

CRITIC
It is a truly frightful piece

Another CRITIC joins them

CRITIC 2
It is indicative of mental disease

CRITIC
It is wretched and abortive

The Third critic bursts out laughing The others turn to
him

CRITIC 3
Sad

Now two LADY CRITICS are looking at Turners work
LADY CRITIC
Mr Turner seems to have taken

leave of form altogether

LADY CRITIC 2
Hmm

LADY CRITIC

He has on former occasion chosen to
paint with cream or chocolate yolk
of egg or currant jelly

LADY CRITIC 2
(Laughing)
But here he uses his whole array of
kitchen stuff

LADY CRITIC
Eggs and spinach

LADY CRITIC 2
No Soap suds and whitewash

They both laugh

In a popular theatre to the raucous delight of the audience
a music-hall sketch is being performed A GROUP OF MEN AND
WOMEN stand looking in the window of an art dealers A
BAKERS BOY appears with a tray of jam tarts on his head

BOY ACTOR
Jam tarts Jam tarts
Fresh jam tarts

He goes over to the shop window Much hubbub from the stage
crowd

Then the Baker’s Boy accidentally spills the tarts over the
painting on display and runs off The audience laughs

Turner is standing at the back of the circle He laughs too
An actor playing the Art Dealer enters (ACTOR 1)

ACTOR 1
Where is that wretched bakers boy

ACTOR 2
His fate I fear he wont enjoy

ACTRESS 1
He will indeed the lad destroy

ACTOR 1
Aha I have an inspiration

ACTOR 3
Whats that

ACTOR 4
Were filled with fascination

ACTRESS 2
What is he doing

ACTOR 2
And why is he doing it

Actor 1 is doing something to the ruined painting

ACTRESS
Whatever hes brewing well soon
be viewing it

ACTOR 1
A masterpiece I here present
which Mr Turner has just sent

The painting is now covered with broken jam tarts The
audience laugh uproariously Turner is horrified The group
of actors recite in chorus

ACTORS
While mostly blessed with good
intent
we have our doubts
But whos this gent

A fashionably dressed elderly actor enters

OLD ACTOR
Ye common throng and hoi polloi
I am a rich and cultured boy
My wealth derives from tricking
knaves
and selling coffee tea and slaves
My house is full of things of
beauty
- paintings sculpture and other
booty
I like to drink and gourmandise
But what is this that greets my
eyes

He has spotted the ruined painting now covered with the jam
tarts

ACTOR 1
It is the latest thing in Art

ACTRESS 1
It looks like bits of old jam tart

Turner watches grim faced

ACTOR 1
Tis Mr Turners latest piece
which placed above your
mantelpiece -

OLD ACTOR
Oh cease your costermonger sounds
Ill buy it Heres a thousand
pounds

He produces a wad of bank-notes with an elaborate gesture
The audience boos

ACTOR 1
Oh sir I thank you in my humble
way

OLD ACTOR

Dont grovel Send it round today
He exits

ACTOR
Ill do so sir without delay

ACTORS
Rejoice Hurrah Hip hip
hooray

The Old Actor returns

OLD ACTOR
Though ignorant of art and taste
Im filled with boundless glee
for whats good enough for
Turner
is good enough for me

He exits followed by all the other actors except Actor 1
who goes into his shop The audience cheers and whistles and
claps Turner leaves much disturbed

In the empty corridor of the theatre a lone young usher
stands briefly as Turner passes him on his way out of the
theatre

At a dinner party somewhere Turner is sitting at a large
table amongst many FELLOW DINERS He is very drunk A
BUTLER fills his glass but Turner gestures to him to fill it
more Then he eats a desert very sloppily

Indistinct overlapping snippets of conversation can be heard
from unseen and half-seen ladies and gentlemen Some
characters we have met can be discerned - Captain Jones and
John Ruskin in particular

Some snippets

design that my imagination could
suggest and he promised to write a
poem

Very sage Captain Mr Ruskin I
fail to see wherein lies the

charity in misleading people as to
the amount of talents they possess

Well talent is something that lies
dormant and needs to be drawn out
in the right circumstances

Yes if one has the opportunity to
have it drawn out

My wife Effie er I am still
waiting for her talents to arise
and be drawn out

I’m sure that talents can be
crushed as much as they may be
drawn out

Ah precisely

Perhaps it is the duty of the
husband to draw out any such
talent

Plutarch who said Painting is
silent poetry Are you
interested in poetry at all

A young woman (RUSKIN’S WIFE) sitting next to Turner now
smiles politely at him He gestures to her

TURNER
Sublime Loneliness Solitude
Ti Tis not the same

RUSKINS WIFE
Indeed not Mr Turner

TURNER
It will come Mrs Ruskin it will
come Love

They share a moment

Early morning Turner is asleep fully clothed on his old bed
in his house Hannah enters and puts down and cup of tea
beside him Then she leans over him and looks at him He
snores and turns onto his back She opens the curtains
Turner wakes up

TURNER
Oh What is the hour

HANNAH
Five-and-twenty to seven

Turner mutters sits up and moves to the foot of the bed
with great effort Hannah brings him his tea

TURNER
Thank you

HANNAH
The suns up in all its glory

TURNER
I must get on

He takes a sip of tea and gives her the cup and saucer
Then he puts on his shoes Hannah lingers He stands and
starts putting on his coat Hannah puts down the teacup and
helps him on with his coat

HANNAH
Dont you want your breakfast

TURNER
No thank you kindly Are you
faring well

HANNAH
Yes Thank you And yourself

Turner puts on his hat

TURNER
Hmm Yes yes

He picks up his bag

HANNAH
Will I be seeing you tonight

TURNER
Unlikely

HANNAH
Tomorrow

TURNER
No

HANNAH

Oh I might as well stop changing
the bed sheets in here

Pause

TURNER
Hmm

Turner leaves the room Hannah sits on the bed forlorn

Outside Turner and Mrs Booth’s new house in Chelsea

Lots of

people pass to and fro Some distance from the house Turner
sits sketching on a jetty Mrs Booth comes out of the house

with a broom She calls to Turner

MRS BOOTH
Mr Booth

Turner turns They wave at each other She goes indoors
Turner picks up a piece of bark stands stiffly and walks

towards the house

Mrs Booth comes out again She nods to a PASSING WOMAN

MRS BOOTH
Good day to you

Then as Turner nears she goes back into the house
follows her

MRS BOOTH
Tis warmer now

TURNER
Sultry day

They are now both inside She closes the front door

MRS BOOTH

She takes Turner’s hat off his head and hangs it up

MRS BOOTH

TURNER
Bit of drift bark
MRS BOOTH
Ooh Hmm

She takes the bark and puts it down Then she helps him off
with his coat

TURNER
Sticky Horrid parched

They go through to the kitchen where Turner sits at the
table Mrs Booth pours him a drink

A busy London street A sign announces that the shop that
Turner now enters is a Daguerreotype Institution He
examines the shop window and enters

Inside he is greeted by a young fresh-faced man CORNELIUS

CORNELIUS
Good morning sir

TURNER
A very good day to you sir

CORNELIUS
Nice day sir

TURNER
Hmm-mm

Turner looks at small daguerreotype portraits on the wall
The photographer MAYALL enters

MAYALL
Ah Good morning sir

TURNER

MAYALL
(laughing)
At your service Mr Booth Now if

yourself comfortable

TURNER

time

MAYALL
(laughing)

Turner hesitates then climbs a few steps to a raised
platform

TURNER
I denote from your brogue that you
hail from the Americas

MAYALL
From the fine city of
Philadelphia sir

TURNER
Philadelphia Tis on the eastern
coast is it not

MAYALL

MAYALL

TURNER
Indeed

MAYALL
Then I should recommend the hat on
sir

TURNER
Hmm

MAYALL

Now if I might deploy this
device

He proceeds to place Turner’s neck into a steadying clamp

TURNER
Hey What is this heinous
implement

MAYALL

Merely a gentle holding brace sir

TURNER
Puts me in mind of a surgical
instrument Does it hurt

MAYALL
Not in the slightest I assure you
So if I may

TURNER
Hmm

Mayall adjusts the brace

MAYALL
Not too uncomfortable for you Mr
Booth

TURNER
Hmm

MAYALL

Thank you sir
TURNER
What is the significance of the
looking-glass
A mirror on a stand is beside Turner Mayall adjusts it
MAYALL
It is to illuminate your good self

sir

Light from the mirror falls on Turner’s face
TURNER
As the sun upon a lake

MAYALL

Most droll Mr Booth Most droll

He laughs and starts humming

TURNER

What is concealed behind the small

brass cap An optic

MAYALL
Oh yes sir a glass lens

Mayall opens the cap revealing the lens

TURNER
As a telescope

MAYALL
Not unlike a telescope sir
you Cornelius

He takes a large drape from Cornelius

TURNER
It is prismatic

MAYALL
I fear not sir It is an
achromatic lens

TURNER
Achromatic

MAYALL
Now let me peruse you

Mayall puts the drape over his head

TURNER

Thank

Why are you shrouded in the manner

of a condemned monk

MAYALL

I am simply shutting out the light

Mr Booth Ah splendid sir

TURNER

The image you create is not of

colour For why

MAYALL
I am afraid that is a question we
have yet to answer sir It isa
mystery Thank you Cornelius

He has taken off the drape and has positioned himself behind
the camera Cornelius inserts the plate

TURNER
And long may it remain so

MAYALL

Now if I may ask you to focus your
gaze here on the flowers and we are
almost ready Thank you
Cornelius

(hums )
Now I will require your absolute
stillness for the next ten seconds

Turner holds the pose

MAYALL
And we begin

He takes off the lens cap looks at his pocket watch and for
ten seconds hums the tune of the Chorus of Hebrew Slaves from
Verdi’s ‘Nabucco’

MAYALL
(laughing)
And there we have it
TURNER
Tis done
MAYALL

It is finished sir

TURNER
I fear that I too am finished

MAYALL
Oh come come sir

He laughs

TURNER
Hmm

In the Chelsea house Mrs Booth examines the now mounted
daguerreotype portrait of Turner

He adopts an exaggerated parody of his pose

In Mayall’s shop Turner and Mrs Booth are sitting side by
side posing for the camera Mrs Booth is petrified
Throughout the scene we look only at Turner and Mrs Booth

TURNER

question

MAYALL

to capture a rainbow Hmm

TURNER

Niagara Falls is a natural
phenomenon that I have long desired
to witness

MAYALL
Is that so sir
(to both)
Now madam sir if I may ask you
to fix your gaze here upon these
beautiful flowers Thank you
Cornelius

TURNER
The Niagara Falls Soon painters
will go about the world with a
box like a tinker instead of a
portfolio under their arms

MAYALL
Well Im Im sure they will

TURNER
Hmm
(growls) (exhales)

MAYALL
Now if you are comfortable madam
sir we may proceed

They hold their poses Mrs Booth is terrified

In Turners gallery which is now very untidy Strewn about
the floor are buckets and bowls to catch drips A large
wealthy-looking middle-aged WELL-DRESSED GENTLEMAN is
inspecting paintings

Hannah appears with a glass of sherry which she gives him

GILLOTT

HANNAH

She gives a drink to Turner who is standing nearby

nib from steel and making money

things that give me pleasure And

Turner chuckles Pause

GILLOTT

In their Chelsea house Turner and Mrs Booth are in Turner’s
studio He is painting ‘Norham Castle Sunrise’ whilst she
is washing out his paintbrushes Suddenly Turner recites
one of his own poems He turns and performs it to Mrs Booth
pointing his brush at her

TURNER

will
It is anxious each wish to fulfil
But I prithee dear Molly be

He points his brush at her Amused she continues cleaning
brushes

She laughs Turner advances towards her

TURNER
To the centre of where love lies
between
She laughs
TURNER

A passport to bliss is thy will
Yet I prithee dear Molly be still

MRS BOOTH

light
With my kisses Ill hide em I

Yet prithee dear Molly be still
MRS BOOTH
(joining in)
Yet prithee dear Molly be still

TURNER
By thy bosom so throbbing with
truth
Its short heavings to me speak
reproof
By the half-blushing mark on each
hill

Oh my Molly dear Molly be still

Mrs Booth continues to giggle and laugh Turner fondles her
breasts from behind her They both laugh

He nestles his chin on her shoulder Then his attention is
caught by his painting and he returns to it Mrs Booth
watches him shakes her head and resumes cleaning his
brushes

At the Royal Academy Varnishing Day again but many years
later Turner examines three Pre-Raphaelite paintings which
are hanging together

They are ‘The Woodman’s Daughter’ by John Everett Millais
‘Mariana’ also by Millais and ‘Chaucer at the Court of
Edward III’ by Ford Maddox Brown

Turner is highly amused by these offerings and chortles
until he coughs

In Turner’s London house which has now become extremely
cluttered and untidy Turner enters the hall muttering to
himself He takes off his coat and throws it on a table
Then he goes into his studio and picks up a canvas He
returns to the hall puts down the canvas then takes another
coat from the coat-stand puts it on along with his hat and
picks up the canvas and his umbrella

A busy day - people horses hustle and bustle Turner
carrying the canvas approaches his house A WOMAN NEXT DOOR
is selling drinks to two boys from a stall Turner arrives
at his house He hesitates for a moment

Mrs Booth is in the kitchen polishing the silver at the
table Turner enters with the canvas

He suddenly gasps and appears to choke

Turner’s house Hannah arrives at the table on which Turner
has thrown his coat One of her cats is sitting on it

HANNAH

She shakes the cat off the coat The cat has soiled it

HANNAH

She feels something in the pocket She takes it out It’s
an envelope out of which she slides a letter Then she
looks at the envelope more closely It is addressed to
Turner at his Chelsea address She ponders this for a while

Chelsea Turner is in bed He is very ill Mrs Booth

Turner sighs Dr Price sits on the bed Pause The doctor
sighs again

DR PRICE

DR PRICE

Dr Price puts on his hat and walks off Mrs Booth surveys
the scene then goes in

As Dr Price moves away he passes two women one of whom has
her face largely covered by a cloth We soon see that this
is Hannah She is with a YOUNGER WOMAN COMPANION Outside
the house next door to Turner’s the neighbour (the seller of
drinks) and ANOTHER WOMAN watch Hannah and her friend as they
pass

Arriving at Turner’s and Mrs Booth’s house they stop
Hannah has the envelope with her

HANNAH
Number six

She looks up at the house for a moment Then she turns away

HANNAH

HANNAHS FRIEND

The two women exchange looks

Turner is in bed He is staring feverish hallucinating
Mrs Booth comforts him

MRS BOOTH
Shh shh shh shh shh

Turner pushes her off

TURNER
(frightened)
Aaah
MRS BOOTH

She comforts him again

Another day Mrs Booth is looking out of the bedroom window
Turner is in bed

MRS BOOTH
Poor wretched soul

Turner throws back the covers

MRS BOOTH
She be drowned dead

TURNER
Hmm

MRS BOOTH

There The suffering she must have

Turner gets out of bed and joins her at the window

MRS BOOTH
If there be a God he be a cruel
one

Turner picks up a sketch book which is beside her

MRS BOOTH
What are you doing

TURNER
I have to sketch her

He leaves the room

MRS BOOTH
Get back into bed now Joseph
Mallord William Turner

He proceeds down the stairs

MRS BOOTH
No no no no no no There be no
shoes on your feet

She follows him

Outside a young woman lies on the river bank She is dead -
drowned A POLICEMAN scuttles about ANOTHER POLICEMAN
crouches by the corpse Turner arrives on the jetty whilst
Mrs Booth tries to put his coat around his shoulders He
starts to sketch the body but he is weak He mutters to
himself Mrs Booth tries to pull him away He tries to
resist He is in pain

MRS BOOTH
Oh there Let me take you in

Turner mutters
MRS BOOTH
There No Come in You can finish

that later

She helps him back towards the house Neighbours have
gathered round They watch him go

Turner is in bed asleep Mrs Booth sits at his bedside
looking towards the window Dr Price sits on the other side
of the bed

Silence

Turner surfaces a little He groans Mrs Booth turns to
him

TURNER
Me damsel
Mrs Booth smiles warmly at him
TURNER
(clearly)
The Sun is God
He laughs And then he dies
Dr Price gets up and checks Turner’s pulse Mrs Booth
buries her head in Turner’s arm The doctor gently closes
Turner’s eyes

Silence In the distance the sound of a flock of geese

Long pause

Now in silence we see Turner sketching silhouetted against
an enormous setting sun

Some time later Mrs Booth is cleaning the window of her
front door She polishes vigorously for a while Then she
stops and reflects Warm tender memories tinged with
humour and sadness She resumes her task

And now in Turner’s old house Hannah is ill and frail She
emerges from the gallery muttering Slowly she shuffles
into Turner’s studio She is weeping A sad lost soul

SLOW FADE TO BLACKOUT

NOTE

Hannah’s skin disease (psoriasis) which is marginally
evident in the early part of the film gradually deteriorates
over the years By the end it is palpably severe
