OVER BLACK

Held for a beat in the darkness and silence a series of
written TEXT appears upon the screen

In 1959 Pope John the XXIII assembled
the Second Vatican Council The Catholic
Church had not assembled an ecumenical
council in nearly 100 years

Between 1962 and 1965 the Council also
referred to as Vatican II issued 16
documents

The aim of these documents was a broad
relaxation of the Church with an eye
towards projecting a more welcoming
image

The words then fade leaving only a hollow empty space
Before piercing through the void we begin to hear a
VOICE A young girl no more than 19 years old
whispering so softly and intimately

SISTER CATHLEEN (VO)
So many people settle for a love that
doesn’t ask much of them that they don’t
have to make any real sacrifices for I
didn’t want that I wanted an ideal love
that asked everything of me That I would
have to sacrifice everything for

Her voice too fades just as an echo of distant MUSIC
begins to fill in - Requiem Pie Jesu Gabriel Fauré -
gradually rising encircling and imbuing the atmosphere
with a quality as solemn as soaring

FADE UP

EXT COURTYARD COLONNADE - DAWN

Rays of light and sunshine pierce in little pockets
through the courtyard of this 20th Century version of an
ancient monastery A BELL begins to chime in the
distance awakening the day

We are now moving down a long exterior walkway following
a massive expanse of big black billowing fabric that
seems float along the floor as soft as waves in water
Blue Rev (mmddyy) 2

PULLING BACK we realize we’re actually following behind
a faceless NUN from this particular monastery of women
THE SISTERS OF BELOVED ROSE She seems to move with a
strange sense of urgency the hem of her habit dancing
behind her

REVEREND MOTHER (0S)
Our father who art in Heaven hallowed
be thy name Where are you

INT CHAPEL - MORNING

Now inside the order’s sacred chapel we drift through
the space on our own- Revealing a panoramic resplendence
of vaulted MURALS the immaculate ALTAR OF CHRIST silk-
like streams of soft and hazy light that drip in through
windows above

At the same time and all alone within the shadows the
same NUN has moved to the floor in the middle of the
chapel lost herself in prayer She whispers

REVEREND MOTHER
Where are you Where are you Where are
youWhy are you doing this to us
Now when I need you most

But we’re suddenly jolted by the abrupt and jarring SOUND
of a

INT NOVITIATE DORMITORY HALLWAY - MORNING
ANGLE ON an OLD WOODEN CLAPPER

As we now find ourselves inside the long central hallway
of a small dormitory for girls known as the “Novitiate”

We follow behind as another NUN SISTER GENEVIEVE 47-
Gradually makes her way down the hall clapper in hand
It’s 5 am and she is loudly ‘clacking’ beside the door of
each and every girl that is housed here It’s her job to
awaken them all make sure they’re never late for Mass

INT NOVITIATE DORMITORY VARIOUS CELLS - MORNING

Moving one by one into a number of the private rooms
called “Cells” that make up the dorm A variety of YOUNG
WOMEN- Sisters CHARLOTTE EMILY CANDACE - Are suddenly
JOLTED awake once the clapper lands at their door They
all quickly bolt from their beds shake off the
drowsiness and hurry to the floor to pray
INT SISTER CATHLEEN’S NOVICE CELL - MORNING

Before in one room in particular containing no more than
a simple metal frame BED and an ICON OF CHRIST along the
wall we find SISTER CATHLEEN - A stunning and ethereal
young novice of only 19 Cathleen’s also already wide
awake eyes wide open and staring straight at the door

As the sound of the clapper then reaches Cathleen she
too hurries from her bed to the floor

A gentle call then emanates in from the hall

SISTER GENEVIEVE (0S)
Benedicamus Domino

With Cathleen and all her fellow novices calling back

NOVICES IN UNISON
Deo Gratsias

MOMENTS LATER Cathleen begins to undress out of her
nightgown and into her WHITE VEIL NOVICE HABIT For the
brief moment that she’s also left NAKED and unclothed we
notice how awkwardly she holds her nightgown to her body
struggling to climb into one garment while still
clutching the other Clearly the shame of her nudity
makes her so uncomfortable even when she’s all alone

CLOSE ON Cathleen’s face as she at last pins on her VEIL
so effortlessly without the benefit of a mirror Right
before our eyes she’s transformed from a girl to a nun

INT NOVITIATE DORMITORY STAIRCASE - MORNING

Now the entirety of the NOVITIATE some 15 young women in
total all rapidly descend the dormitory staircase one by
one No more than a flurry of passing feet and floating
veils

EXT CONVENT - MORNING

The sound of the BELL chimes even louder as the same
group of novices now wordlessly walk in two tight lines
through the hazy morning light of the courtyard They are
moreover such an exquisite looking procession almost
military-like in their lock and step unison They seem to
all move together like a balletic flock of birds
Somewhere tucked into the line we also observe Cathleen
demonstrating such composure in her ‘Custody of the
eyes’ With arms softly crossed along her stomach and
each hand hidden in the opposite sleeve With eyes
perpetually lowered and locked in a blink-less downward
gaze

Beat

SISTER CATHLEEN (VO)
I was 17 years old when I first came to
the convent 18 when I entered the
Novitiate

INT CHAPEL - MORNING

Back within the chapel the ENTIRE COMMUNITY OF ROSES
have now gathered for the daily ritual of MASS As a
PRIEST stands at the altar back to the congregation we
watch his HANDS begin to carefully lay out his
ACCESSORIES for the service

At the same time as we also peer through the pews to see
the room packed to the gills with over 200 nuns all
ranging in ages from 16-100 Moving all around and
through them from one pew to the next we look deeply
into so many of their still and solemn faces The
collective sense of reverence and rapture so palpable
you can almost taste it

PRIEST (0S)
Mea Culpa mea culpa mea maxima
culpaBaptistam sanctos Apdstolos
Petrum et Paulum omnes sanctons
Oremus

And suddenly all is silent dead silent A silence so
rich deep and voluptuous it creates its’ own presence
in the room Such a powerful silence that is broken only
by the occasional COUGH or BREATHE before

SISTER CATHLEEN (VO)
And I’m sure a lot of people could
probably never understand it Never
understand why someone so young with
their whole life in front of them would
want to give it all away to God

We then slowly begin to PAN across the faces of all the
Novices all knelt together in a line before altar-
Noticing how shockingly young and innocent they all are
Most of these girls all now in their final stages of
training to be nuns are barely even out of high school
CATHLEEN (VO)
They think of nuns today and all they
see is a bunch of old women Women who
couldn’t find husbands Women who for
whatever reason just couldn’t make it in
the outside world So ran off toa
monastery to escape everything

We then finally land on Cathleen just as her eyes glance
up with such longing at the altar She just stares
straight up at it while all other heads around her are
bowed

CATHLEEN (V0O)
What they don’t understand though is
beneath everything else We were women
in love

Cathleen then finally closes her eyes giving herself
over to prayer She whispers

SISTER CATHLEEN
Oh Lord I adore you You’re all I could
ever want

FADE OUT

OVER BLACK
A new TITLE now appears on the screen
10 YEARS EARLIER

Just as the sound of some iconic feeling 1950’s POP SONG
begins to drift in together with that of a far off
distant TRAIN HORN

FADE UP

RURAL TENNESSEE VARIOUS - DAY

Music from a local Tennessee radio station plays through
the background as we come to a quaint series of tableaus
of the rural South as it once was the lost and forgotten
feeling of a great American heartland We see great wide
open farms the quietude of suburban streets church
steeples towering high above

At the same time we begin to hear the echo of a CHURCH
BELL
EXT LOCAL CATHOLIC CHURCH - DAY

It’s Sunday morning with the church bell ringing calling
this small Tennessee town to Mass An exterior of the
local clapboard CHURCH reveals a small stream of arriving
locals smiling and greeting each other along the way

Before A CAR pulls up and

NORA HARRIS - Cathleen’s somewhat hard scrabbled
though deeply loving and devoted mother Together with a
much younger CATHLEEN - Both step out into the
parking lot

Nora looks around for a moment checks the car mirror for
any lipstick in her teeth before she finally glances up
at the church with a noticeable air of skepticism and
anxiety

NORA
Come on honey let’s give this a whirl

At the entrance Nora and Cathleen are then suddenly
stopped by some husky wide-grinning MAN in his 50s
Already seeming a bit “over friendly” for Nora’s taste

CHURCH USHER
Why Nora Harris I don’t believe it Is
that really you

Nora turns feigns surprise

NORA
Oh yeah Hey Rob how you been You been
good

CHURCH USHER
(turning to Cathleen)
Yes Ma’am I most certainly have But
wait a minute now please don’t tell me-
Is this really Cathleen

NORA
Yeah can you believe it growin’ up so
fast

He then bends down to Cathleen squeezing her cheeks
CHURCH USHER
Hey pretty lady now you know you’re not
allowed to grow up that fast Soon you’1l
be taller than me

He turns back to Nora
CHURCH USHER (CONTD)
Gotta say I’m a little surprised to see
you here Long as I’ve known you I
don’t think I’ve ever seen you within 500
yards of Sunday worship

NORA
Yeah well don’t get your hopes up I’m
not here to be saved or nothing Just

figured it was about time Cathleen had a
chance to see for herself what

religion’s all about- Or ‘supposed’ to be
about Besides we were a little bored

CHURCH USHER
All right good enough for me Why don’t
you come on in we’ll find you a seat

Nora and Cathleen then follow the man inside

LOCAL PRIEST (0S)
Blessed be God and the Father

INT LOCAL CATHOLIC CHURCH - DAY

Entering mid-sermon a LOCAL PRIEST stands addressing a
small but packed house Nora and Cathleen squeezed into
the crowd

LOCAL PRIEST

Because although you have not seen him
you still love him Although you don’t
know him you still believe in him You
feel his presence all around you without
knowing his name and you rejoice with an
indescribable ecstasy For if there’s
one thing we know it’s that God’s love
is unconditional

Seemingly woefully unimpressed Nora glances at her
watch She then glances at Cathleen surprised by how
riveted and attentive her daughter seems Young Cathleen
just stares in wonder in much the same way we saw her
stare before

EXT HARRIS HOUSEHOLD - DUSK
A hush of evening falls over this quiet rural street

somewhere along the poorer more neglected part of town
No bigger than a trailer sits the Harris’ little house
INT HARRIS HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT

Inside their cramped little home Nora and Cathleen sit
together at the kitchen table A cigarette dangling from
Nora’s mouth as she spoons out veggies on their plates

NORA
Really wish you’d eat more honey you
know I worry about you sometimes

Nora reaches to push away the hair from Cathleen’s face

NORA (CONTD)
So did you like going to that church
today

CATHLEEN
Yeah I did

NORA
Really What’d you like about it most

CATHLEEN
I don’t know I guess I just thought it
was peaceful

NORA
Peaceful Huh Yeah I guess it was kind
of peaceful

CATHLEEN

What kind of Church was it again
NORA

Catholic
CATHLEEN

Are we Catholic

NORA
No we’re not really anything I suppose
Truth is I don’t particularly believe in
religion myself think it’s a waste of
time But once you get older you can
make up your own mind

A sudden GLARE of HEADLIGHTS then floods the kitchen
windows together with the SOUND of a CAR pulling up
Nora’s eyes quickly turn and we notice the change of
expression
EXT HARRIS HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT

Just outside the house the figure of a youngish MAN hops
out of an old PICK-UP TRUCK starts heading for the front
door with a bit of a wobbly step

INT HARRIS HOUSEHOLD - NIGHT

And now CHUCK HARRIS 35 - Nora’s deadbeat husband and
Cathleen’s barely present father - Finally comes through
the door Not only that but right from the moment he
enters we can already tell there’s no place this guy
less enjoys being than home

Chuck heads straight for Cathleen hugging and kissing
her It’s unclear if he’s drunk or not

CHUCK
Hey hey Hey baby how’s my girl how’s
daddy’s little girl What did you do
today baby huh Did you have a good day
today

CATHLEEN
Daddy Where were you We were waiting
for you for so long Where were you

All while Nora just stares with daggers in her eyes

NORA
A fair question Where you been Chuck

Chuck just looks at her and shrugs his shoulders It’s
not a question he cares to answer

CHUCK
Huh What do you mean by that Nowhere in
particular Just out that’s all

NORA
Oh Cause we’ve been sitting here all day
waiting on you You never heard of a
phone or

CHUCK
Nora please I’m home And yes I’ve
heard of a phone

NORA
(under her breath)
Great youve heard of a phone Chuck
Great Chuck that’s just great
Chuck heads to the fridge to grab a beer Then finally
turns back to Nora it’s clear things are about to get
unpleasant

CHUCK
What do you want me to say Something in
particular you’d like to hear me say
Tell me what it is I don’t give a fuck
I‘ll say it

NORA
I don’t know I guess I just want you to
be a man that’s all Be a fucking father-
Maybe learn how to sacrifice a little

CHUCK
Oh gimme a break you serious with that
I am a man Christ’sake I was out now
I’m home Look at me here I am HOME
So just drop it leave me alone

NORA
Drop it Seriously You know what
just Fuck you Chuck

CHUCK
Fuck me No fuck you Nora You know how
tired I am of this shit Every single
time I gotta hear this all this shit
Well I’m sorry I’m not the person you
want me to be I’m fucking HOME

NORA
Not the person I want you to be Not the
person I want you to be No cause
you’re not even CLOSE You’re the
WORST you hear me THE WORST

CHUCK
I was out THAT’S ALL You know what
forget it I can’t fucking stay here

Chuck then SMASHES his plate down on the floor heading
back for the door While Nora herself jumps from the
table suddenly SCREAMING and wildly chasing after him

NORA
Where do you think you’re going You’re
leaving again You can’t do that You
can’t keep leaving us whenever you want
You have a daughter for Christ’sake I
hate you you hear me
Finally the door SLAMS leaving Cathleen all alone The
little girl just sits in utter silence as her parents
yell cry and scream at each other outside Beat

EXT ABANDONED ROAD - AFTERNOON

It’s now 5 years later 1957 as we hold on an old and
dusty road deep in the middle of Tennessee farmland Far
in the distance we also just make out the sight of TWO
FIGURES moving toward us Too hazy to see their faces
all we really see is their BIG BILLOWING BLACK CLOTHING

EXT HARRIS HOUSEHOLD - DAY

The late summer sun blazes as a now older Cathleen - 12
years old - Stands beside Nora helping her mom as they
hang a load of laundry together

Fussing with a clothes pin Nora’s eyes then slowly do a
double take noticing the bizarre sight of these two
ELDERLY NUNS- Sisters GLORIA AND ELEANOR both 50s -
Making their way straight up to her house

NORA
Excuse me Hey there Can I help you
Sisters

One of the sisters turns and smiles The other just nods

SISTER GLORIA
Are you Mrs Harris

NORA
Yes

SISTER GLORIA
My name is Sister Gloria this is Sister
Eleanor We’re from Our Lady of Blessed
Sorrows the Parochial School just up the
road You know it

Bewildered Nora just looks at Cathleen then back at the
nuns

NORA
Uh yeah Yeah I think I know the
one you mean

INT HARRIS HOUSEHOLD LIVING ROOM - LATER

A LITTLE LATER in their family living room Nora
scrambles to lay out her best tea seat for the Sisters
While Cathleen sits quietly beside her mother just
staring at the nuns in awe

SISTER ELEANOR
We’re very proud to say that it’s the
nuns sisters like us that built the
Catholic school system in this country
Brick by brick

Nora smiles as she pours them both tea

NORA
That’s nice

SISTER GLORIA
Your little one is so lovely by the way
May I ask how old

NORA
Huh Oh Cathleen’s 12 Just getting
ready to start middle school actually

Nora finally sits down glancing quietly at a small
PAMPHLET on the table A brochure for the Sisters’
school

NORA (CONTD)
Look I appreciate your coming by Sisters
I do But truth is we’re just not that
religious I mean we try to go to
church when we can you know like
everybody else But the truth is my
husband Cathleen’s father he left us
awhile back So it’s just me taking care
of the two of us and

SISTER GLORIA
I’m so sorry to hear that Mrs Harris
God cherishes your strength

SISTER ELEANOR
Of course that can’t be easy One
thing you should know though our doors
are open to everyone practicing and non-
practicing alike

SISTER GLORIA
Our first priority is just to provide an
exceptional education Doesn’t every
child deserve that

Nora looks at the brochure again She then turns to
Cathleen still staring mesmerized at these strange women

NORA
Well how much does it cost I don’t know
if we can really afford a fancy school
like this

The two sisters just look at each other and smile

SISTER ELEANOR
That’s just it right now we’re offering
full scholarships On a first come basis

EXT BLESSED SORROWS - DAY

The first day of school has arrived Along the well
groomed grounds tons of excitable young TEEN and PRETEEN
GIRLS bound about the campus in their BLESSED SORROWS
uniforms

INT BLESSED SORROWS CLASSROOM - DAY

Inside a small traditional 1950s classroom- A billow of
fabric then comes drifting along the floor winding
through a row of school desks

Two girls in the back giggle and pass notes at the same
time as an OLDER NUN TEACHER in full habit stops dead
center glances around at them all

NUN TEACHER
Silence girls silence So I have a
question for all of you- How many in this
room were baptized Catholic

As the majority of girls then immediately shoot up their
hands Cathleen just looks at the ground

NUN TEACHER (CONT’D)
Don’t worry this isn’t a judgement on
anyone’s background The reason I ask
is because I’m wondering if any of you
know what the difference is- Between the
Catholic religion and all other
religions Protestants Baptists Jews

A few girls giggle others roll their eyes and yawn
Before the Teacher finally goes to the board and slowly
writes out “LOVE AND SACRIFICE”

NUN TEACHER (CONT’D)
Love and Sacrifice Of course there are
many different ways that people choose
to show gratitude to their Lord But I
believe what differentiates the Catholic
religion from so many other religions
is the full extent we’re willing to go to
demonstrate our passion Because if
there’s one thing we all know for sure
there’s just no such thing as true love
without sacrifice

Seated in back Cathleen looks up intrigued As if
something about this strange notion appeals to her

EXT BLESSED SORROWS - DAY

It’s recess hour on another day Though as all the other
girls run and play Cathleen just sits by herself against
a tree Somewhat of a loner

Another teacher a rather attractive young nun of roughly
30 then gradually approaches SISTER MARGARET- Not only

one of the ‘cooler’ teachers at school but a woman whose
very presence exudes an ocean of understanding

SISTER MARGARET
Hey there How come you’re sitting all
alone You don’t want to join the others

Cathleen suddenly looks up

CATHLEEN
(shyly)
Huh They’re all talking about their
boyfriends I don’t have a boyfriend

SISTER MARGARET
Oh no Me neither I’m told they’re
overrated

Cathleen laughs Sister Margaret winks sweetly and sits
down beside her

SISTER MARGARET (CONT’D)
I’m Sister Margaret by the way You’re
Cathleen right I haven’t had you in my
class yet but I’ve noticed you

CATHLEEN
(surprised)
You have

SISTER MARGARET
Sure I noticed you because you’re shy
like me You seem to like to be by
yourself a lot To think a lot

CATHLEEN
(self-conscious)
I guess so

SISTER MARGARET
It’s okay I like to be by myself and
think a lot too

Cathleen just stares at her for a moment

CATHLEEN
You do About what

SISTER MARGARET
(thoughtfully)

Probably seems stupid but mostly about
God Whenever I’m alone I like to sit by
myself and just contemplate him wonder
about him even love him inside my
mind I know a lot of girls at this
school find that quite silly

Cathleen looks at Sister Margaret so captivated

CATHLEEN
I don’t think it’s silly

SISTER MARGARET
You don’t Well thank you for that

They both laugh Sister Margaret then quickly stands back
up reaches a hand down to Cathleen

SISTER MARGARET (CONT’D)
Come here I want to show you something
Can I show you something

INT BLESSED SORROWS GENERAL CHAPEL - DAY

Now inside the school’s tiny chapel votive candles
illumine the altar highlighting a tiny WOODEN HOUSE and
a HALO of GOLD LIGHT A TALL STATUE OF CHRIST looms
proudly in the corner

The door to the chapel then opens with Sister Margaret
quietly leading Cathleen inside and into a pew Sister
Margaret stares at the altar in a strange sort of
reverential silence then whispers to Cathleen

SISTER MARGARET
You see that little light in there
That’s his light God’s light And the
statue behind that’s the savior of
course Jesus Christ

Cathleen just takes it all in

CATHLEEN
I know who they are But why are you
showing this to me

SISTER MARGARET
Just because someone likes to be alone
doesn’t mean they don’t sometimes still
crave intimacy

CATHLEEN
But you really think God and Jesus are
real Like real the way other things are
real

SISTER MARGARET
Of course I do More than do Because I’m
married to them silly Didn’t you know
that all nuns are Brides of Christ

Cathleen now looks at her so confused

CATHLEEN
Huh What do you mean But why I bet you
could’ve married anyone you wanted to

SISTER MARGARET

(blushing a little)
Oh I’m not so sure about that And
either way I doubt any other
relationship would’ve been quite as
fulfilling It’s twice as hard to love
God as anybody else Which for me means
my love is twice as worthy

Another SCHOOL BELL chimes in the distance

SISTER MARGARET (CONT’D)
Ooops I gotta go Got class

Sister Margaret then gets up looks down at Cathleen

SISTER MARGARET (CONT’D)
Well come on you coming

Cathleen thinks it over turns back to Margaret sweetly

CATHLEEN
If it’s okay by you Sister maybe I’‘1l
stay a bit If that’s okay

Margaret nods then quietly heads out Cathleen waits
turns again towards the statue and the flame

INT BLESSED SORROWS GENERAL CHAPEL - EVENING

MUCH LATER now the chapel is completely dark and
seemingly empty That is except for Cathleen who
continues to just sit all alone in the pews unable to
take her eyes off the altar

She pauses a moment then puts her hands together and
starts to pray It’s clear she’s never done this before
but it seems to come naturally

DISSOLVE TO

INT BLESSED SORROWS GENERAL CHAPEL - EVENING

Before in the exact same position and as if the prayer
itself had never ended we see a much OLDER Cathleen-
Sitting in the same very pew with the very same rapt look
on her face Though now it’s 1962 and Cathleen 17

An OLD WOMAN seated in a front then starts to walk out of
the Chapel nodding and smiling at Cathleen as she
passes who nods and smiles back

OLD WOMAN
‘Night Cathleen

CATHLEEN
See you later Miss Williams

INT HARRIS HOUSEHOLD LIVING ROOM - EARLY MORNING

It’s well before the crack of dawn as Cathleen wanders
through her house trying not to wake Nora She’s then
suddenly startled to discover a STRANGE MAN by himself in
their living room in the middle of pulling up his pants

Shocked Cathleen just lowers her eyes tries not to look
at the man as she passes

CATHLEEN
Hi

Clearly startled this guy can’t wait to get out of
there

NORA’S ONE NIGHT STAND
Oh hey how are you

INT HARRIS HOUSEHOLD KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

We hear the sound of the front door SLAM as Cathleen
then enters the kitchen surprised to discover Nora
there just staring out the window smoking a cigarette as
she watches him go

CATHLEEN
Who was he
Nora turns startled
NORA
Huh Oh just a friend of mine that’s
all
CATHLEEN

(under her breath)
Another one

Nora just looks at Cathleen and frowns Beat

NORA
What are you doing up so early anyway

CATHLEEN
I set my alarm early so I could go to
Mass before school

Slightly taken aback Nora tries not to show judgement

NORA
Oh Oh okay You need a ride
CATHLEEN

No it’s okay Thanks though

Cathleen then starts to head back down the hall before
Nora thinks it over and calls out to her again

NORA (0C)
Hey Cathleen

She comes back stopping in the threshold

CATHLEEN
Yeah
NORA
You’re not ummmm Getting too into
God and all that are you

CATHLEEN
Huh What do you mean

NORA
I don’t know I guess I just mean there’s
more to life than you know praying and
going to church and all that You do
know that right honey

CATHLEEN
(unconvincing)
Yeah of course I know

INT BLESSED SORROWS GENERAL CHAPEL - DAY

In the Chapel again Cathleen returns to her daily
practice of just sitting in church meditating in the
pews We hold on her like this for a LONG moment Before
gradually a feeling comes over her and she slowly turns
almost as if called by something to look toward the
STATUE OF CHRIST

Barely even blinking Cathleen then rises from the pews
and begins to walk straight to the statue

Moments later as she now stands face to face with it she
looks straight into Christ’s eyes while his seem to look
back at hers and almost as if she and the statue are
sharing their own secret conversation Cathleen takes a
deep breath tears begin to well in her eyes

INT BLESSED SORROWS TEACHERS OFFICE - DAY

Sitting across the desk from Sister Margaret in her
office Cathleen seems almost breathless as she tries to
explain

CATHLEEN
I decided something today Sister I
decided I want to give myself to God I
want to be married to God like you I
want to be a nun

Sister Margaret looks shocked for a minute then smiles

SISTER MARGARET
Really You’re serious I didn’t
realize you’d even been thinking about it
so seriously Cathleen

CATHLEEN
I was in the chapel the other day
praying like I always do when suddenly
this feeling came over me Something I’ve
never felt before Like this presence all
around me telling me telling me

Sister Margaret continues looking at her searching her
eyes

SISTER MARGARET
Telling you to be a nun

CATHLEEN
I think so

Sister Margaret smiles

SISTER MARGARET
So many girls your age pray and pray for
a vocation that never comes If it really
was His voice calling you consider
yourself very lucky

Cathleen just smiles starting to blush

SISTER MARGARET (CONT’D)
Youre such a passionate girl you remind
me of myself at your age I’m happy
for you Cathleen I think you’re making
the right decision

INT HARRIS HOUSEHOLD LIVING ROOM - DAY

Later in the night Nora and Cathleen are now alone in
their living room Cathleen just watches as Nora paces
back and forth seeming about to explode

NORA
A nun What are you talking about a
nun That’s just fucking crazy Cathleen
where is this even coming from

CATHLEEN
I knew you wouldn’t understand It’s fine
if you don’t understand
NORA
It’s not that I don’t understand it’s
just that it’s the stupidest thing I’ve
ever heard You’re telling me you want
to go throw your life away in some
convent and you expect me to understand

CATHLEEN
But it’s not throwing my life away It’s
not throwing my life away

NORA
You think I wanted this You think I
wanted to be a single mother like this
I did the best I could I tried

CATHLEEN
What does that have anything to do with
it This decision doesn’t have anything
to do with that It just has to do

NORA
With what Jesus Christ what the fuck
Cathleen What does it have to do with
What is this all about

Cathleen suddenly looks like she’s about to cry

CATHLEEN
I’m in love okay I’m in love And I
really don’t care if you understand it or

not

NORA
In love With who with what I don’t
get it

Now Cathleen just stares at the ground in silence before
it all suddenly dawns on Nora

NORA (CONTD)
With God Oh my God you’re in love with
God But I don’t get it that doesn’t
even make any sense

CATHLEEN
Mom I’m sorry but I was called and I’m
going to be a nun and there’s nothing you
can do to stop me I wish you could just
be happy for me

But Nora just stares at Cathleen baffled Before her
voice then suddenly gets much much much quieter

NORA
Cathleen youre a 17 year old girl
You don’t know anything about religion
and you for sure don’t know anything
about love You want to know what I
think I think you’re about to make the
biggest mistake of your life

Still barely holding back the tears Cathleen just stares
at Nora for a long time She then turns and walks
straight out of the room Feeling completely lost from
her daughter Nora shakes her head Beat

FADE OUT
OVER BLACK

Returning to the black we again hear the sound of a far
off and tolling BELL As if calling us somewhere

INT CHAPEL - DAWN

Before back within the hushed confines of the chapel of
the Sisters of Beloved Rose the same faceless Nun sits
knelt before the altar consumed again in her intimate
secret prayers

REVEREND MOTHER
Why are you doing this Why are you doing
this I don’t understand it Someone
gives you their whole life makes every
kind of conceivable kind of sacrifice
And this is what I get

EXT CONVENT GROUNDS - DAWN

Along the lush and manicured grounds of the convent a
set-up that looks a lot more like a posh boarding school
than some cold isolated monastery - A whole community of
NUNS wander all throughout busying themselves about
their day And it really does feel like a whole world in
and of itself A secret society of women on their own
that couldn’t be more self-sufficient or self-contained

INT CONVENT MEETING ROOM - DAY

At the same time inside the convent’s large and well
appointed meeting room a group of about 20 YOUNG GIRLS
most of them fresh out of school all sit around
whispering and waiting
As a matter of fact these are all the order’s new
POSTULANTS including Cathleen who’ve just arrived to
begin the first stage of their training as nuns

Lingering around the front keeping an eye on them all
are also 3 older sisters- SISTER MARY GRACE 30 SISTERS
ANNE and KATE 27 - They try and keep the room quiet
giving an occasional “Shhhhh”

Before all out of nowhere the room falls silent And just
as none other than REVEREND MOTHER MARIE SAINT CLARE 56-
A frank tough as nails clergy woman of the old style
who occasionally lets her under developed emotions get
the better of her- Finally enters Reverend Mother
quietly makes her way to the front of the room flanked
by her most loyal lieutenant Sister Genevieve Her mere
presence so halting and domineering as to already put
the fear of God in these girls

Now Reverend Mother just stands at the head of the room
looking over all the girls She remains DEAD SILENT for
such a strangely long time no one quite sure why

Before finally another BELL chimes at which point
Reverend Mother immediately relaxes and smiles

REVEREND MOTHER
Good afternoon all of you My name is
Reverend Mother Marie St Clare You can
call me Reverend Mother or simply Mother
if you prefer that instead I’m also
the Mother Superior or Abbess of this
particular Order of Sisters of Beloved
Rose I myself have been a Rose nearly 40
years now Meaning some 40 years ago I
first walked through those gates as a
Postulant- same as all of you- Now 40
years later I’ve not once set foot
outside those gates since

She pauses looking around at all the girls We watch
Cathleen’s eyes lower trying to avoid her gaze

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
So what is my role my job here
exactly Well as far as all of you
are concerned- You might consider me like
the voice of God around here Meaning
that unfortunately since God can’t be
here to run this convent Himself- My
voice will serve as a stand in for His
And whenever you hear this very voice
speak from my mouth- You can expect it’s
on behalf of his wishes
She pauses again making sure they all heard it

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
Now during the next 2 and a half years of
your training to become nuns here I
personally will be separating the wheat
from the chafe determining which of you
actually belong As opposed to which are
simply the victims of a childish
imagination And that’s because here
in this room in this monastery- God is
not a fantasy to us Not a daydream not
a fantasy And he’s certainly not your
invisible best friend either To the
contrary God is work Hard work The
work of a very special kind of love
youre all going to be trained in

Turning to look at all the girls we see a multitude of
intimidated faces

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
So youll be spending your first 6 months
as postulants After that and for those
of you who make it- You’1ll be invited to
take your very first vows in your first
temporary marriage to Christ- And enter
the Novitiate However and as a rule
we make a point never to discuss the
Novitiate until we’ve been through it
ourselves So for now youll just have
to wait

Cathleen looks up so curious by the notion of the
Novitiate As all the girls are

REVEREND MOTHER(CONT’D)
Finally let’s talk about silence for a
moment Because we observe two types of
silence here Regular Silence and Grand
Silence Now during regular silence if
you find you need to speak for whatever
reason That’s permissible However and
starting at 9pm each night when you hear
that last bell signifying the start of
Grande Silence That means you - Don’t
Talk Period

We hear a general nervous MURMUR throughout the room

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
Are there any questions

The room is then deadened nobody daring to speak Before
some brave young girl in the back raises her hand

However and instead of calling on her Reverend Mother
just looks at the girl blankly for an extremely long
time Beat It’s awkward

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
Put your hand down sister postulants
don’t have questions And you are free to
go home

She then turns backs to the group as a whole

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
Now when you return to your cells later
this evening

INT POSTULANT DORMITORY MAIN HALL - DAWN

Gazing down the empty hallway in the Postulant dormitory
all is quiet- Before suddenly SISTER ANNE together with
SISTER KATE take the same wooden CLAPPER and start
clapping and rattling all the way down the hall

INT POSTULANT’S CELLS - MORNING

A couple of the new POSTULANTS- Sisters SISSY and EVELYN-
immediately jolt from sleep practically falling out of
bed and straight onto the floor They then fumble through
their prayers fighting back the intermittent slew of
sighs and yawns

INT CATHLEEN’S CELL - MORNING

Meanwhile in Cathleen’s cell she herself is already wide
awake fully dressed in her new POSTULANT UNIFORM and
waiting on the edge of her bed As if so determined to
not be late she literally stayed up all night

Cathleen adjusts and readjusts herself a couple times
before the clapper then finally makes its way to her
door Now she too drops and heads for the floor
Blue Rev (mmddyy)

INT NOVITIATE DORMITORY STAIRCASE - MORNING

Almost afraid to look back at them Sister Mary Grace now
leads a sleepy clumsy confused and out of step
procession of all these girls down the staircase in the
postulant dorm They all keep tripping and stumbling over
each other while Mary Grace just shakes her head

INT CHAPEL ANTEROOM - MORNING

As the procession at last reaches the entrance to the
chapel Mary Grace pauses them all silently indicating
that it’s time to put on their veils All the girls then
start digging in their pockets at once hurrying to get
the veils out fast struggling to figure out how to tie
them

INT CHAPEL - MORNING

With the entire community of Roses there and waiting the
full Postulant precession finally enters the chapel
every head turning and looking at them curiously

Mary Grace leads them all to their assigned pews each
girl stopping to genuflect before the altar before taking
their seat All while Reverend Mother sits in her own
pew watching each girl carefully

MOMENTS LATER Mass has begun with the Priest softly
whispering

PRIEST
Oreta Glory be to the Father to the
Son the Holy Spirit

The entire congregation then lowers heads to pray Except
for Cathleen who can’t help but steal a glance toward the
altar where all the Novices are now receiving communion
Cathleen watches in awe then returns to prayer

EXT REFECTORY - DAY

An endless line of NUNS stand outside the convent’s
refectory (dining hall) with the entire community
waiting to enter for lunch single file

As each woman then steps to the front of the line we see
Reverend Mother herself perched beside the door so
formally and perfunctorily greeting every sister as they
pass

NUN IN LINE
Good afternoon Reverend Mother Praise
the Lord

REVEREND MOTHER
Now and forever God Bless Sister

And so on and so forth We then slowly PAN back to the
far end of the line to see Cathleen just waiting her
turn

INT REFECTORY - DAY

A little LATER inside the dining hall rows upon rows of
old wooden tables trace the room’s perimeter where each
group of sisters all sit according to rank

At the same time the entire room stands waiting in
silence While Sister Genevieve provides the community a
reading before the meal

SISTER GENEVIEVE
Totally love Him Him who gave Himself
totally for your love He Christ is the
splendor of eternal glory The brightness
of eternal light The mirror without
cloud

We again hold on Cathleen as she continues to listen and
pray

INT CONVENT MEETING ROOM - DAY

All together in a tight circle the entire group of new
postulants surround SISTER MARY GRACE- Whom we ourselves
now recognize to be an incredibly warm kind almost
progressive feeling young woman To such a point in fact
it’s hard to reconcile how her personality conforms to
that of a nun

Mary Grace just smiles at all the girls trying to make
each one feel welcome All while her two main
subordinates Sisters Anne and Kate who themselves seem a
lot less welcoming stand behind and watch

SISTER MARY GRACE
I haven’t really had a chance to formally
introduce myself yet But I’m Sister Mary
Grace and I will be your Postulant
Mistress for the next 6 months Perhaps
even your Novice Mistress after that
(MORE )

SISTER MARY GRACE (CONTD)

Oh and these are Sisters Anne and Sister
Catherine Kate Both first year
professed both just took their final
VOWS

(she smiles toward the girls)
We’re so very proud of them
Anyway all of us all 3 of us are really
just here to help guide you as you start
to adapt to our way of life here And
I’m sure it’s all going to feel very
different at first That’s okay that’s
normal I know when I first came here
everything seemed so strange I didn’t
think Id ever truly make it as a nun
But please don’t worry Just do the best
you can I’m sure you’re all going to do
great

We notice reactions of all the girls they all seem so
comforted by her even a bit enamored

SISTER MARY GRACE (CONT’D)
So the first thing we should go over is
the schedule Postulants usually have
the same schedule everyday And really
the most important thing is you pay
close attention to the bell Because
really everything we do here all day
long all comes down to the bell

Mary Grace smiles once more as the sound of another BELL
is heard At the same time as music drifts in

MONTAGE UP

EXT COURTYARD - MORNING

Following behind a faceless nun we pick up Sister Anne
as she crosses quickly looking up toward the steeple as
the bell continues

SISTER MARY GRACE (0S)
So the first bell you’1l hear each
morning is the 5am bell

INT SISTER CANDACE’S ROOM - MORNING

Alone in her cell Sister Candace so intensely and
passionately whispers her morning prayer to Christ

SISTER CANDACE
Oh Lord through the immaculate heart of
Mary I offer you my prayers works and
sufferings throughout this day

SISTER MARY GRACE (0S)
That’s the bell that let’s us all know
it’s time to get up get dressed get
ready for morning Mass

INT SISTER CHARLOTTE’S ROOM - MORNING

As Charlotte too kneels by the side of her bed saying
the same prayer soon the two sisters’ voices are joined
Followed by more and more voices creating an ongoing
chorus of collective whispered prayer

EXT COURTYARD - MORNING

A single line of NOVICES march together through the
morning light and all in such perfect military
precision towards the chapel

INT CHAPEL - MORNING

As the whole community is gathered again for Mass the
priest FATHER LUCA begins to recite the service in
LATIN

SISTER MARY GRACE (0S)
Mass begins once Father Luca arrives
Father always keeps his back to us the
whole time and he always reads the
liturgy in Latin

Turning into the pews we then see sisters Emily Evelyn
and Candace all sharing the same LatinEnglish
TRANSLATION BIBLE - The poor girls are desperately trying
to figure out what Father Luca is actually saying

EXT REFECTORY - AFTERNOON

A small group of NUNS stand completely silent and staring
up towards the steeple and bell Once the bell finally
rings again they all turn to each other and start
laughing and chatting away

SISTER MARY GRACE (0S)
After daily chores youll hear the third
bell of the morning That’s how you’1l
know that Grand Silence is over

EXT REFECTORY - AFTERNOON

The same long line of nuns stand single file outside the
dining hall Each sister stopping to formally greet
Reverend Mother before entering inside for lunch

INT REFECTORY - AFTERNOON

Again in the refectory all the sisters stand before
their plates silently listening to the morning reading

SISTER MARY GRACE (0S)
As you probably noticed all our meals
begin with a reading And even though
it’s after Grand Silence we do try and
remain as quiet as possible during
meals

At the same time and as the reading continues we notice
one young NOVICE strangely step away from her table
slowly walk to the center of the room and lay herself
prostrate on the floor

SISTER MARY GRACE (0S)
(CONTD)
Oh and sometimes you might see some of
the novices doing their own penances in
the refectory Probably best to just
ignore it at least until you’re novices
yourselves

EXT CONVENT GROUNDS - AFTERNOON

Somewhere along the convent grounds another group of
NOVICES all struggle together to carry an enormous SIX
FOOT WOODEN CROSS all lunging one leg in front of the
other across the courtyard It is an unbearably arduous
looking task

SISTER MARY GRACE (0S)
Everyday after the 3pm bell is when we
have our lessons together

Blue Rev (mmddyy) 31

INT CLASSROOM - AFTERNOON

As all the postulant sit behind small wooden desks in the
convent classroom Mary Grace wanders through all the
desks teaching them all SIGN LANGUAGE

SISTER MARY GRACE
As you probably remember Reverend Mother
made it very clear that we are not to
speak during Grand Silence So let’s
practice a little of our sign language
shall we

The girls then all quickly open the little SIGN LANGUAGE
BOOKLETS on their desks with Mary Grace looking over all
their shoulders helping them all

EXT COURTYARD - DAY

Another BELL before we look out to the courtyard and see
all the postulant girls take off in flight Running like
kids laughing and chasing each other in a game of tag

At the same time Cathleen somewhere off from the others
sits alone in the colonnade and reading the bible She
hears the joyful SHRIEK of all her postulant mates
playing turns and looks for a moment then immediately
goes back to her studying

INT SISTER CANDACES ROOM - CONTINUOUS

We then return once more to Sister Candace and her
ceaseless repetitious but deeply passionate praying We
hold on her like this as the music gradually fades

HARD TO BLACK

FADE UP

INT REV MOTHER’S HOUSE HALLWAY - MORNING

Inside a long hallway within the Motherhouse we follow
the billowing habit of another faceless NUN

INT REVEREND MOTHER’S OFFICE - SAME TIME

Alone in her private office Reverend Mother sits at her
desk reading scripture to herself Before suddenly
there’s a knock at the door and Sister Genevieve peeks
her head in a small PACKAGE in her hands
Blue Rev (mmddyy) 32

SISTER GENEVIEVE (0S)
Excuse me Reverend Mother sorry to
bother you But you just received another
package from the Archdiocese

Reverend Mother then looks up a bit surprised

REVEREND MOTHER
May I have it please Sister

Genevieve hands her the package as Reverend Mother
carefully unpacks a large stack of DOCUMENTS from a small
ENVELOPE

As she then slowly starts glancing over all the papers
it becomes clear that there’s something rather sensitive
about the content of these documents Reverend Mother
looks back up at Genevieve

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
Thatll be all thank you Sister

Waiting for Genevieve to leave she starts flipping
through the papers again- Clearly unnerved by whatever it
is she’s reading This package is a problem

EXT RURAL GROUNDS - DAY

A beautiful sunny afternoon as all the postulants lay
together in a field of grass surrounding Sister Mary
Grace Sister Evelyn also in the midst of explaining

SISTER EVELYN
My mother always said at least one child
should be sacrificed Even though I come
from a big family I’m still the only girl
of 5 brothers so I guess it was pretty
obvious which one of us was gonna end up
becoming a nun I’m happy about it
though I’m just so proud to be here
showing all my devotion I don’t care how
hard it’s supposed to be I just can’t
wait til’ we all get into the Novitiate
and get to wear those white veils

Some of the other girls smile and nod as Mary Grace
turns back to the group

SISTER MARY GRACE
Thank you sister Okay who’s next

Sister Emily then immediately raises her hand

SISTER EMILY
Well as for me I had two cousins and
one older sister that all chose the
Sisterhood So in a way I guess you
could say it’s kind of in my blood
Matter of fact my great aunt was even
once named Mother General for the whole
entire state of Texas

Emily smiles proudly as many of the other girls look
impressed

SISTER EMILY (CONT’D)
Pretty much as far back as I can
remember all I wanted was just to follow
in all their footsteps
(somewhat in jest)
Who knows maybe even one day die young
and become a saint

There’s a bit of laughter through the crowd even Mary
Grace can’t help but laugh She glances around again
before her eyes land on Cathleen

SISTER MARY GRACE
And what about you Sister Cathleen Did
you always know you wanted to be a nun

Cathleen looks self-conscious

SISTER CATHLEEN
Me No I mean I wasn’t actually
raised in the church so

Now all eyes turn and everybody stares at Cathleen

SISTER CANDACE
What What do you mean you weren’t raised
in the church Aren’t you Catholic

SISTER CATHLEEN
I don’t know No I guess not in the same
way everyone else is

SISTER CHARLOTTE
Well what are you even doing here then

A bunch of the other girls start giggling

SISTER MARY GRACE
(scolding)
Shhh Sister Candace please Ladies
come on

SISTER CATHLEEN

(so shyly)
No it’s okay it’s okay I went to
Catholic school so that’s where I first
learned about the sisterhood I never
planned on being a nun I just I just
thought it seemed like such a beautiful
idea to be able to spend my whole entire
life devoted to love I just thought a
life like that seemed worth every
sacrifice

A few girls continue to snicker while others seems quite
taken if not admiring of Cathleen’s sincerity

INT REVEREND MOTHER’S OFFICE - MORNING

Seated across from Reverend Mother in her office Mary
Grace waits awkwardly in silence- All while Reverend
Mother’s attention is completely buried in the same stack
of DOCUMENTS we saw before In fact Reverend Mother
barely even looks up as she asks her

REVEREND MOTHER
(under her breath)
So how are the new postulants Any I
should be thinking about sending home

SISTER MARY GRACE
Huh No it’s the opposite actually

She pauses to see if Reverend Mother might give up some
of her attention Not finding it she continues

SISTER MARY GRACE (CONT’D)
I’ve really been so impressed with them
as a group They all seem so excited and
full of energy So passionate about
really discovering their relationships
with Christ I’d be lying if I were to
say their enthusiasm didn’t make me a bit
jealous

At this Reverend Mother seems to glance up but only
briefly

REVEREND MOTHER
Well that’s good

SISTER MARY GRACE
Sorry what is that you’re reading
Reverend Mother finally slides the documents to the side
turning more directly to Mary Grace

REVEREND MOTHER
This It’s a memorandum Sent over by the
Archdiocese the other day Regarding
something called Vatican II

All while Mary Grace just looks at her confused

SISTER MARY GRACE
Vatican what What is that

REVEREND MOTHER
From what I understand our Pope’s
suddenly gotten it in his head to try and
turn himself into some sort of
“reformer” He’s organized some new
council in Rome- Bishops Cardinals
Theologians- To discuss how the church
needs to change be more in step with the
new era of the 1960s

SISTER MARY GRACE
Really Meaning what exactly

REVEREND MOTHER
Meaning I guess he thinks we’ve all
grown a bit outmoded

Mary Grace suddenly looks a bit excited by this

SISTER MARY GRACE
Really wow But that’s a good thing
though don’t you think The church
hasn’t reviewed any of its practices in
over a 100 years maybe longer Isn’t
it a good thing

All while Reverend Mother just looks at her so steely

REVEREND MOTHER
Really You think the church needs to
change Are you questioning me

SISTER MARY GRACE
(caught off guard)
You No of course not Mother I just

REVEREND MOTHER
I guess I disagree I happen to think the
church is perfect exactly the way it is

Mary Grace looks towards the papers again
SISTER MARY GRACE
Well what kind of reforms are they
talking about exactly Is that what’s in
the memo Can I see

Reverend Mother quickly slides the documents out of
reach

REVEREND MOTHER
It’s really not important I guarantee
you this will all blow over very soon
Certainly nothing for you to concern
yourself over Mary Grace

She then finally shoves the documents in a drawer
smiles

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
You were saying about the new
postulants

INT POSTULANT CLASSROOM - DAY

The Postulants all stand gathered around Sister Anne in
the midst of demonstrating “how to walk” to them As she
speaks we also notice that Sister Anne like Sister

Kate is a bit meaner and less tolerant than Mary Grace

SISTER ANNE
Everybody pay attention I’m going to
show you how we walk It’s called
‘Custody of the eyes’

Sister Anne then begins to walk in a straight line
demonstrating the specific posture to perfection

SISTER ANNE (CONTD)
You put your hands inside your sleeve
like this Always go slowly gracefully
never ever in a hurry Most important
is you keep your eyes down Make sure
youre always looking straight ahead at
the floor in front of you

SISTER CANDACE
Why

Sister Anne then stops dead in her tracks turns and
glares at Candace

SISTER ANNE
Excuse me

SISTER CANDACE
Why do we have to walk like that I mean
what if we can’t see where we’re going

A few GIGGLES erupt from the group

SISTER ANNE
Shhh Not that it’s your place to
question anything sister But it’s a
part of our discipline We keep our eyes
down to show God how focused we are on
always giving him our full attention

Anne then looks around motioning to Sisters Emily and
Charlotte

SISTER KATE
You two come here

The two girls look at each other then immediately hurry
over

SISTER KATE (CONTD)
And stand face to face

Emily and Charlotte then stand face to face

SISTER KATE (CONTD)
Now both of you look each other in the
eyes

Reluctant at first the girls do as their told At first
just looking then gradually staring more directly and
intimately into each other’s eyes It’s tense and
uncomfortable

SISTER KATE (CONT’D)
What just happened

SISTER CHARLOTTE
I started thinking about her

SISTER EMILY
Yeah I started thinking about her too

SISTER KATE
Exactly We’re not supposed to think
about each other We’re only supposed to
be think about God Because even though
this is a community we’re not here for
each other We are here only for God

We hold on Cathleen quietly taking it all in
EXT REFECTORY COLONNADE - DUSK

The sun begins to set over the convent as we find
Cathleen alone in the courtyard so diligently
attentively practicing her Custody of the Eyes Her
concentration is almost spooky as we hear her voice
whisper in

SISTER CATHLEEN (0S)
I love you God I love you so much more
than I ever thought I could love anything
in my life I love you so much more than
myself even

INT SISTER CATHLEEN’S CELL - EVENING

Before we find Cathleen all alone in her cell knelt on
the floor beside her bed so intimately praying out loud

SISTER CATHLEEN
Thank you Lord for letting me be here
Thank you for letting me love you like
this Thank you for letting me feel you
so close to me

As she continues to whisper we notice her breathing
become heavier and heavier A strange intensity to it

INT FAMILY RECEPTION AREA - AFTERNOON

Inside the convent’s family waiting area Nora sits
beside a number of other PARENTS all very wholesome
looking married couples She seems nervous already her
first visit since Cathleen left home Not too mention
being the only single parent doesn’t help

A DOOR at the back of the room then opens as another set
of PARENTS step out A NUN on duty then motions to Nora
that it’s her turn to enter

INT PRIVATE ONE ON ONE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

As she’s now brought into the adjoining room Nora looks
up surprised to see a large METAL GRATE running down the
center of the room with Cathleen there waiting on the
other side It’s an eerie sort of set up not unlike what
you might expect to find in a prison

Cathleen and Nora smile awkwardly between the grate it’s
a strange sort of reunion both of them having missed
each other so much neither of them knowing quite what to
say They sit down

NORA
Wow this is the first time I’ve seen you
in your ‘outfit’

SISTER CATHLEEN
I know Do you like it

NORA
(hesitantly)
You look like a real nun

SISTER CATHLEEN
I do thanks But I’m not a real nun
yet Not yet

NORA
(indicating the grate)
What’s with this by the way This thing
here It’s like a prison or something

SISTER CATHLEEN
Nothing It’s just the way they do it A
symbol of our enclosure

NORA
Enclosure What’s that supposed to mean

SISTER CATHLEEN
Nothing Never mind

Beat

NORA
So how are you You like it here How is
it are you happy

Cathleen smiles

SISTER CATHLEEN
I am yeah I don’t know how to
describe it but I am happy I feel like
I really belong here

Now Nora looks disappointed this is clearly not the
answer she was hoping for

NORA
I guess that means you’re planning on
staying then

(MORE )
NORA (CONTD)
You plan on staying on to take those vows-

What’s it called again the nova novi--
2

SISTER CATHLEEN
Novitiate It’s just a temporary vow we
take for two years to find out if we
really ready to be married to God for
forever But Mom I’m pretty sure I’m
going to be here my whole life

Now Nora just can’t take it anymore
NORA
Jesus Christ Cathleen what the hell did
I do wrong

SISTER CATHLEEN

Mom please You promised
NORA
Sorry I’m sorry sorry I just still

don’t understand what you’re doing here

SISTER CATHLEEN
It’s okay you don’t have to I’m just
happy to see you

NORA
I’m happy to see you too

Beat

SISTER CATHLEEN
Anyway how have you been

NORA
Fine good I picked up a couple extra
shifts at work recently just trying to
keep busy I guess I don’t really know
what else to do with myself you know I
mostly just miss you so much

Cathleen suddenly looks a bit struck by this like she
didn’t quite realize it would hurt so much

Beat
SISTER CATHLEEN

And what about Dad You heard anything
from Dad
NORA

(surprised)
Youre father Not really Your grandma
called Said he’d been sick or something
Maybe that’s why you probably haven’t
heard from him You want me to track
him down see if he’1l come visit I’m
sure he wants to see you

Cathleen thinks about it then shakes her head

SISTER CATHLEEN
It’s okay don’t bother I’1l just pray
for him it’s fine Anyway I kind of
have to go now

NORA
(instantly heartbroken)
What what do you mean you have to go We
have ten more minutes

SISTER CATHLEEN
I know but it’s kind of a busy day so
Maybe we can spend more time together
next time

Cathleen then begins to get up

NORA
Wait Wait Cathleen can you just
wait

Cathleen pauses just looking at her

NORA (CONTD)

Can I Can I just touch your hand for a
minute Just for a minute if that’s
okay

Nora then moves her hand up along the grate holding it
out for Cathleen Cathleen thinks about it a moment just
looks at her sadly

SISTER CATHLEEN
I’m sorry mom but we’re really not
supposed to touch like that I’m sorry
I really have to go now though

NORA
Okay but Cathleen Listen I love you
okay

Cathleen barely pauses before heading out the door

SISTER CATHLEEN
It’s good to see you Thanks for coming

She then walks straight out leaving Nora completely
crestfallen by the encounter

EXT CONVENT GRAVEYARD - AFTERNOON

Far off
Candace
chasing

MOMENTS
some of

Beat

along the convent grounds Sisters Sissy and
race around through a CEMETERY laughing and
each other like overactive schoolgirls

LATER they wander together Sissy pausing to read
the grave stones

SISTER SISSY
Cant believe all the sisters that died
here You think we’re going to die here
too

SISTER CANDACE
That’s the point isn’t it I want to die
here I want to die here cause I know
it’s the closest place on earth to get to
Heaven

SISTER SISSY
I guess I just didn’t realize it was
really going to be like this

SISTER CANDACE
Like what

SISTER SISSY
That we’d really be spending our whole
entire lives here never ever going home
again We won’t even be able to go to our
parents’ funerals

SISTER CANDACE
Who cares they’1ll be dead already so
it’s not like they’1l notice Don’t you
think just knowing he knows we’re here
for him knowing we’re so much more
special to him than anybody else- Don’t
you think that makes it worth it

SISTER SISSY
(unsure)
I guess

SISTER CANDACE
Well why’d you want to come here then

Sissy suddenly looks a bit embarrassed

SISTER SISSY
Audrey Hepburn

SISTER CANDACE
Huh What are you talking about

SISTER SISSY
Audrey Hepburn I wanted to be a nun
because of Sister Gabrielle in The Nun’s
Story She was just so perfect and holy
and beautiful and everything I just
wanted to be like her

INT CHAPEL - EVENING

All alone in the back of the darkened chapel we find
Sister Mary Grace lost in thought Looking more closely
she seems a bit stressed if not silently stricken by
something She tries to pray but for some reason just
can’t Tries to pray again but still can’t Finally she
just stares off into space searching for the answer to
something

INT POSTULANT HALLWAY - EVENING

Along the floor of the Postulant hallway Cathleen and
Sister Sissy now sit together whispering

SISTER SISSY
I guess i’m just not sure if I really
feel it you know

SISTER CATHLEEN
Feel what

SISTER SISSY
My relationship with him whatever we’re
supposed to feel Like I can’t tell if
he’s really there and I’m really
communicating with him or if it’s all
just all in my head

Cathleen stares into Sissy’s eyes so compassionately

SISTER SISSY (CONT’D)
You feel him right What does he feel
like to you

SISTER CATHLEEN
I don’t know Just like a presence
that’s all Like a really warm and
comforting presence Like falling asleep
in a parents’ arms

SISTER SISSY
RM says we can’t fake our relationship
with him because even if no one else
does he’1l1 still know and he’1l shun us
for it But what if I’m faking and I
don’t even realize

SISTER CATHLEEN
Don’t worry I don’t think you are

SISTER SISSY
How come

SISTER CATHLEEN
Because if I can feel him here with me
right now that means he must be here
with you too

INT CHAPEL - MORNING
The entire community of Roses is once again gathered for

Mass The priest beckons all the sisters to pray as we
watch a sea of black heads all bow at once

INT SISTER MARY GRACE’S CELL - NIGHT

Later in the evening Mary Grace returns to her cell

Carefully removing her veil she shakes loose all her
tangled hair then plops down on a chair staring
vacantly into space

She remains frozen for a long moment before she then
slowly reaches a hand down to pull up the bottom of her
habit moves her hand between her legs and begins to
masturbate She does it all very rapidly mechanically
almost as if all she wants is to get it over with as soon
as possible As if the shame of the act is something she
can actually out race by doing it fast enough

Finally reaching a climax she drops her head down
breathing heavily Her eyes drift off and stare at the
floor and for a second it almost looks like she might
cry This is a woman in a lot more secret pain and
confusion than even she herself realizes

INT REVEREND MOTHERS OFFICE - DAY

All alone in her office Reverend Mother sits talking on
the phone in what appears to be a very tense call

REVEREND MOTHER
(into the phone)
Yes thank you for calling Yes I
understand Right well It’s not
that I wasn’t going to respond

We then notice her eyes glance angrily across the desk
toward that same stack of Vatican II documents She
shakes her head

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
Of course I understand the historic
nature Right Peace be with you

Reverend Mother then slams down the phone clearly not
happy with the result of the conversation

EXT CONVENT WALKWAY - DAY

It is sometime early afternoon as we again hear the SOUND
of a BELL although now it seems to have taken a somewhat
ominous slightly foreboding tone

As Reverend Mother then walks alone through the
courtyard she passes by one of the Postulants walking
in the opposite direction who softly whispers to her in
passing

SISTER SISSY
Morning Reverend Mother Praise the Lord

Reverend Mother just routinely replies as she continues
on

REVEREND MOTHER
Now and forever God bless

But then Reverend Mother suddenly stops Just halts on a
dime turns right back around and looks at the girl dead
on Beat

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
I’m sorry did you just speak Did I just
hear you speak What’s your name

As we now turn we see that the girl in question is in
fact Sister Sissy just looking up at Reverend Mother
totally bewildered and shocked

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
(in sign language)
What’s your name

Sissy is speechless

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
What Is Your name

SISTER SISSY
Im I’m Sister Sissy

REVEREND MOTHER
Sister Sissy

SISTER SISSY
Right Sissy

REVEREND MOTHER
Well tell me something Sister Sissy
youre a postulant correct - What have
you been doing lately Besides getting
fat showing up late to Mass and running
your mouth during Grand Silence

SISTER SISSY

(terrified)
I I didn’t realize it was Grand
Silence They told us to count all the

bells before noon I counted 3 bells

REVEREND MOTHER
Do you understand what silence means Was
it not properly explained to you When
you hear the bell for Grand Silence that
means silence And silence means you-
Don’t Talk It means you - Shut Your
Mouth

SISTER SISSY
(utterly terrified)
But Reverend Mother You’re
talking

Now suddenly Reverend Mother’s anger level jumps two

fold
REVEREND MOTHER
That’s because I’m reprimanding you
Sissy I am reprimanding you right now

All while Sissy is now on the verge of tears

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
Listen to me Jenny

SISTER SISSY
It’s Sissy

REVEREND MOTHER
What

SISTER SISSY
My name is Sissy not Jenny

REVEREND MOTHER

(in rapid sign language)
I don’t care I don’t care what your name
1is

(speaking out loud)
It doesn’t make the least bit of
difference to me Listen I want you to
get down on your hands and knees

(in sign language again)
Start crawling from here all the way to
the end of this corridor Say as many
Hail Mary’s as you can ‘til you reach the
end

SISTER SISSY
Huh1I

REVEREND MOTHER
(in sign language)
Now Right now
(out loud)
Get on your hands and knees Sister

Sissy then gets down on her hands and knees starts to
crawl along the floor while reciting softly

SISTER SISSY
Hail Mary full of Hail Mary of

REVEREND MOTHER
Wait a minute are you talking Why are
you still talking Why are you still
talking

Sissy looks up terrified as Reverend Mother bends down
starts signing like crazy right in front of her face

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
(in sign language)
Why are you still talking

Sissy just looks at her

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
(in sign language)
Then say the prayer in silence Say the
prayer in silence In
(speaking out loud)
SILENCE SILENCE SILENCE

We watch Sissy continue to crawl across the ground
saying the prayer in silence tears streaming down her
face

INT CHAPEL - EVENING

It is early evening as we again find Mary Grace alone in
the chapel again not praying but just staring vacantly

Suddenly the doors open Cathleen enters as Mary Grace
immediately turns somewhat startled

SISTER CATHLEEN
Oh sorry Sister I didn’t realize you
were in here

SISTER MARY GRACE
That’s okay How are you Sister Cathleen
You can come sit down if you like

Hesitant at first Cathleen then goes and sits in the pew
behind Mary Grace Mary Grace turns and smiles at her

SISTER MARY GRACE (CONT’D)
How’s everything been going for you
sister

SISTER CATHLEEN
Good thank you Sister

SISTER MARY GRACE
And what about the others Are the others
still upset about Sister Sissy being sent
home

SISTER CATHLEEN
I think they mostly understand Even
though everybody misses her I really
miss her

Mary Grace just nods empathetically

SISTER MARY GRACE
Do you often come to the chapel to pray
by yourself

SISTER CATHLEEN
Sometimes I guess now that first vows
are coming up I wanted just to spend
more time communicating with him making
sure he’s okay with me being a Novice

Sister Mary Grace laughs sweetly

SISTER MARY GRACE
I’m pretty sure he’s okay with it

SISTER CATHLEEN
You really think so

SISTER MARY GRACE
I have a feeling he really wants you here
Cathleen His light shines all around
you I think you’1l make a great nun

Cathleen smiles so brightly at this nearly blushing

SISTER CATHLEEN
Thank you Sister That means so much

Mary Grace tries to accept the compliment but looks a
bit guilt ridden There’s a subtle pause as she then gets
up from the pew looks down at Cathleen so tenderly

SISTER MARY GRACE
Do me a favor though just make sure it’s
what you want too Because your wants
matter too Do you know what I mean by
that

Cathleen just looks at her and nods even though it’s
clear she has no idea what it means Mary Grace then
walks out leaving Cathleen so helplessly confused

INT SISTER EMILY’S ROOM - DAY

All alone in her cell Sister Emily is knelt on the floor
praying

SISTER EMILY
Lord please forgive for all the mistakes
I’ve made so far as a postulant I didn’t
focus enough on my prayers this morning
and I rushed straight to Mass Because
I just wanted to be with my friends And
I’m sorry sometimes if it seems like I
pay more attention to my friends than I
do you I’m hoping to change that
Blue Rev (mmddyy) 50

INT CHAPEL - AFTERNOON

It is Choir practice as Sister Mary Grace sits in the
pews watching all the postulants go through their
chanting of the DIVINE OFFICE

POSTULANTS IN UNISON
You shall speak to him and put the words
in his mouth and I will be with your
mouth and with his mouth and will teach
you both what to do

Before suddenly Sister’s Anne Kate and Genevieve come
bursting into the chapel everybody immediately stopping
and turning They then each go and whisper into the ears
of two of the Postulants Marianna and Theresa Both
girls seem so frightened so confused before they
quietly and obediently follow Anne Kate and Genevieve
out

All the while Mary Grace just watches the whole thing
confused trying to figure out what the hell is going on
She finally gets up and walks out of the chapel herself

INT MOTHERHOUSE HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

Outside the door to Reverend Mother’s office Mary Grace
waits and paces unsure if she should enter

The door to the office then opens with the same two
girls Theresa and Marianna both racing out both
hysterically crying

Mary Grace moves to comfort them but then thinks the
better of it as Reverend Mother also emerges The girls
disappear down the hall leaving the two older nuns
alone

SISTER MARY GRACE
What was that all about What just
happened

REVEREND MOTHER
Nothing I’m sending those girls home

SISTER MARY GRACE
Who Theresa and Marianna But why

REVEREND MOTHER
Is that their names Frankly I was told
their relationship was veering toward
something inappropriate

(MORE)
REVEREND MOTHER (CONTD)
That they were starting to become a bit
too intimate with each other

SISTER MARY GRACE
“Too intimate” By who

Reverend Mother just stares at Mary Grace not exactly
pleased with the sudden line of questioning

REVEREND MOTHER
It doesn’t matter who The point is they
clearly don’t belong here and they
needed to be sent home

Beat We see Mary Grace slowly become more defiant

SISTER MARY GRACE
But they’re just young girls away from
home for the first time They’re probably
just friends seeking comfort in each
other

REVEREND MOTHER
Seeking comfort in each other is that
what we all do around here now By the
way are you questioning me again

SISTER MARY GRACE
Questioning you No I

REVEREND MOTHER
Are you questioning my judgement

SISTER MARY GRACE
No Mother I’m just

REVEREND MOTHER
So why don’t you tell me Mary Grace- How
exactly are those girls supposed to make
it their whole lives deprived of any
form of physical affection - When they
can’t even make it 6 months

Mary Grace just stares at her wondering how defiant she

can really be

SISTER MARY GRACE
(under her breath)
Honestly I don’t know Because I don’t
know how anybody does that

Now Reverend Mother suddenly looks shocked and PISSED

REVEREND MOTHER
Excuse me

SISTER MARY GRACE
What I mean is it’s only natural to want
to Because you can’t just cut it off
You can’t pretend it’s not there

REVEREND MOTHER
Cut what off Pretend what’s not there

SISTER MARY GRACE
Forget it

Reverend Mother is silent for a long moment weighing her
words carefully She then moves closer to Mary Grace

REVEREND MOTHER
You know there have been moments
recently here and there when I’ve
started to get the feeling you just don’t
want to be here anymore As if everything
we do requires some sort of interrogation
from you

Mary Grace just stares at the floor shaking her head

SISTER MARY GRACE
Maybe I don’t know Maybe that’s true

Before suddenly Reverend Mother’s anger level jumps big

REVEREND MOTHER
Seriously What is your problem exactly

SISTER MARY GRACE
I don’t know I don’t know what my
problem is Maybe a part of my problem is
you

REVEREND MOTHER
Me

SISTER MARY GRACE
Because I just don’t understand what
youre doing anymore- I don’t understand
your motivations

REVEREND MOTHER
Don’t you God is my motivation God is
my reason and motivation for everything I
do I do everything for him Everything

SISTER MARY GRACE
But that doesn’t necessarily mean youre
really doing what he wants Honestly do
you really think any of us know for sure
what he wants from us

REVEREND MOTHER
Oh I believe I do

SISTER MARY GRACE
Well I think it’s wrong for you to keep
us in the dark about Vatican II Whatever
changes are happening whatever’s in all
those documents you keep hiding If it’s
really going to effect us then we all
deserve to know

REVEREND MOTHER
No you don’t And it’s not going to
effect us Nothing is going to effect us

SISTER MARY GRACE
Then why can’t you just tell us what’s
really going on

REVEREND MOTHER
Because I don’t WANT to And I don’t have
to I don’t have to and I don’t want to

SISTER MARY GRACE
Oh you know what okay FINE FINE
FINE FINE MOTHER

REVEREND MOTHER
THAT’S RIGHT FINE IS RIGHT FINE IS
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT MARY GRACE FINE

Now suddenly they’re both silent Both so shocked by what
has just occurred

Beat

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
(in sign language)
I think I’m going to go pray now I’m
going to go to the chapel and pray

Mary Grace looks at her one more time then just turns
and walks away
INT SISTER MARY GRACE’S CELL - DAY

Later in the night Mary Grace is curled up on the floor
of her cell crying hysterically It’s such a deep and
guttural weeping that goes on and on painful to listen
to Beat

SISTER MARY GRACE (0S)
I know this isn’t our normal hour
together but I just wanted to call you
all in here to let you know something

INT POSTULANT CLASSROOM - DAY

All the Postulants are now gathered in the study room
staring up at Mary Grace who stands at the head of the
room looking back at them all so sadly and tenderly

SISTER MARY GRACE
I wanted to let you all know that I’ve
decided I’m going to be leaving the
convent I’m so sorry I won’t be here
to see you all take your first vows

The room falls silent All the girls look so shocked

SISTER EMILY
What But what do you mean Where are you
going

SISTER CHARLOTTE
It’s because of Reverend Mother isn’t it
She wants to take you away from us

Mary Grace just looks at them overwhelmed by their
devotion

SISTER MARY GRACE
No it’s not because of her It’s not
because of anything I’m just not sure
this life is for me anymore I’ve been a
Rose since I was 16 years old I’1l
always love this place The place where I
grew up But I’m not meant to be here
anymore

They all look so sad a few begin to cry

SISTER MARY GRACE (CONT’D)
As for Reverend Mother I know it’s hard
to understand But I promise all she
really wants is for you to be the best
nuns possible

(MORE )

SISTER MARY GRACE (CONT’D)
To serve God in the best way possible
with the most dignity I know it may
not seem like it but she does care

SISTER EVELYN
Are you still going to be a member of the
church After you leave I mean

Mary Grace pauses for a long beat unsure how to answer

SISTER MARY GRACE
Yes I’1l always be a member of the
church the church is my family And you
all my sisters that I’ve lived here with
day in and day out- You’re my family
too

She now looks at them so tenderly

SISTER MARY GRACE (CONT’D)
I want each and every one of you to know
that I love you with everything in my
heart

We hold for a beat on Mary Grace’s face then slowly

FADE OUT

FADE UP

INT REFECTORY - AFTERNOON

As another reading is taking place we go to a CLOSE UP
on Reverend Mother staring off into space seeming more
consumed and distracted than ever in her own thoughts

SISTER GENEVIEVE

(at the pulpit)
We become what we love and who we love
shapes what we become Imitation is not a
literal mimicking of Christ rather it
means becoming an image of the beloved
An image disclosed through
transformation

MOMENTS LATER the room has fallen silent with everybody
sitting down to eat including Reverend Mother

Before suddenly there is the sound of a loud and strange
sort of COMMOTION
VOICE (0S)
Clear the way please Please clear the
way Clear the way

At first not quite sure what’s going on suddenly
everyone in the room turns to look at once- Just as a
much OLDER NUN roughly 70 charges into the dining hall
completely NAKED and seeming like she’s on some sort of
mission She is also wildly waving her hands in the air
ranting and raving and trying to get everyone’s
attention

NAKED NUN
There’s a new era coming sisters Oh yes
a new era and a new wind is about to
start blowing in here You hear me

Moving to the postulants table ALL the girls try and
hold it in before they instantly break out in laughter
While all the older nuns just stare in shock crossing
themselves and shaking their heads

All the while Reverend Mother just watches the whole
thing with an oddly restrained quietly infuriated
expression

NAKED NUN (CONTD)
Listen to me Because there will come
a time very soon VERY SOON SISTERS
When all your cathedrals will suddenly
come crumbling to the ground And
these trappings and clothing too will
go falling away to the ground And
it’ll be just us sisters Just us and
Him All of us once again naked before
God

As the old naked nun then finally finishes her rant
starting to head back out as Genevieve and Kate
immediately bolt after her trying to cover her

Turning back to the postulants still all so amused- We
hold on Cathleen just watching and half smiling Before
gradually her smile begins to shift into something else
Far more perplexed pensive disturbed

Beat At the same time as music begins to fill in

EXT CHAPEL ENTRANCE - AFTERNOON

Along a separate entrance to the chapel a large CROWD of
about 40 PEOPLE stand waiting to go inside

Blue Rev (mmddyy) 57

These are all the PARENTS of the various postulants as
well as various seculars and locals come to witness the
postulants very first CLOTHING CEREMONY

INT CHAPEL - SAME TIME

An even larger crowd starts to overflow into the chapel
before sooner or later we see Nora there too She is all
dressed up though perhaps a tad inappropriately not too
mention wearing a bit too much make up

As Nora then wanders to find a seat moving in and out of
more people- She accidentally bumps into none other than
Reverend Mother

NORA
Excuse me sorry

The two woman exchange a quick glance Reverend Mother
looking Nora up and down Nora continues on

INT CHAPEL CHANGING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Inside a hidden atrium to the Chapel is a scene of utter
PANDEMONIUM and CHAOS The entire group of our now some
17 postulants hurry to change into their official and
formal WHITE WEDDING DRESSES assisted by a small trio of
OLDER NUNS And these girls couldn’t be more excited

INT CHAPEL ANTE ROOM - LATER

Again in the Chapel Ante Room we see all the girls
clothed in their WEDDING DRESSES scurrying to quickly
get into line

INT CHAPEL - MOMENTS LATER

The music then begins to grow louder harkening the
feeling of something so divine and exalted

Somewhere amidst the pews Nora pushes up on her toes
leaning her head over shoulders then turns her head to
see

The entire immaculate procession of new brides Cathleen
and her fellow postulants all dressed in gowns and
veils so slowly and deliberately to make their way down
the aisle Such a stunning and beautiful procession

We also hold on the face of each girl as they pass
peering into each of their eyes through the veil as
they all maintain their Custody so regally and
exquisitely

MOMENTS LATER all these budding brides are finally knelt
together in a line at the altar A celestial light
outlining and silhouetting them bathing them almost

The back turned Priest then recites

PRIEST
Virginum custos et pater sancte Ioseph
cuius fideli custodiae ipsa Innocentia
Christus Iesus et Virgo virginum Maria
commisa fuit te per hoc utrumque
carissimum pignus Iesum et Mariam obsecro
et obtestor ut me ab omni immunditia
praeservatum mente incontaminata puro
corde et casto corpore Iesu et Mariae
semper facias castissime famulari Amen

Somewhere in the Nuns’ pews Reverend Mother lowers her
head to pray as does everybody else Nora doesn’t realize
what’s going on at first but then sees everyone praying
and finally does the same

Cathleen kneeling in the line beside the others makes
the sign of the cross along her chest

Before the entire congregation is suddenly hushed as
Sister Emily stands alone with the Priest upon the altar
Emily gently genuflects down to kneel before him
gracefully bowing her head as he lifts her veil Emily
and the Priest then look straight into each others eyes

PRIEST (CONTD)
Sister Emily what is it you desire

SISTER EMILY
With the help of God I have come to know
in this community
CUT TO
Sister Charlotte now knelt before the Priest
SISTER CHARLOTTE
Both the difficulty and the joy of a life
completely devoted to him
CUT TO

Sister Candace knelt before the Priest

SISTER CANDACE
My desire is to be allowed to make
perpetual profession within this
community

CUT TO
And finally Sister Cathleen

SISTER CATHLEEN
I seek to become a temporary Bride of
Christ for a year and a half and to
persevere in all my undying love

The traditional WHITE VEIL NOVICE HABIT so precisely
folded in a large cloth square is then handed by young
ALTAR BOYS into each girl’s arms (The final symbol of
their transference from Postulant to Novice)

Moments later all the brides lay on the floor in a row
together as a large BLACK CLOTH baring a single GOLD
CROSS in its center is rolled over them and all their
bodies (Symbolizing their now death to the outside
world)

INT CHAPEL CHANGING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Back in the atrium the group of new Novices still in
wedding dresses are now all lined up anxiously awaiting
something

As we move slowly down the line from one girl to the
next we then discover that what they’re all waiting for
is to have all their hair shorn off by an older SCISSOR-
WIELDING NUN

Many girls also can’t help but tremble and shake as they
lower their heads to be met by the blunt scissor

Finally Cathleen comes to the front on the line bends
down before the scissors

HAIR CUTTING NUN
Ready

SISTER CATHLEEN
Yes thank you Sister

Just as CHUNKS AND CHUNKS of Cathleen’s own HAIR fall in
SLOW MOTION to the floor

INT CHAPEL - AFTERNOON

A sudden shift in music as the entire crowd in the
chapel rise again and look toward the aisle to see

The new group of Novices changed out of their wedding
dresses and re-clothed in their NEW NOVICE HABITS Coming
down the center aisle in procession again

As we look into Nora’s eyes we also see a tinge of deep
sadness realizing her daughter has now turned a corner
she may never turn back from

MOMENTS LATER the Novices all kneel again before the
altar

PRIEST
Ora pro nobis Sancta Dei Genetrix

NOVICES IN UNISON
May we be worthy of Christ’s love

Finally they begin to make their procession back out We
hold on Cathleen as she momentarily breaks custody of the
eyes looking everywhere in the crowd for Nora

Once she finally finds her Cathleen and Nora then
sweetly lock eyes Cathleen shyly smiles at her mom who
immediately smiles back Nora doing her very best to make
her daughter believe she’s happy for her

EXT RURAL CONVENT GROUNDS - DUSK

We hear a shrill sound of LAUGHING before looking over a
field to see the entire group of new Novices dancing
around a BONFIRE They are redressed back into their
WEDDING GOWNS euphoric with laughter dancing and
singing having the time of their life

SISTER EVELYN
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW GOD

SISTER EMILY
I’M MARRIED TO JESUS CHRIST

They all continue to laugh and twirl around the fire like
little girls reminding us again how ridiculously young
they still are

INT NOVITIATE DORMITORY HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

Looking down the long hall in the Novitiate dorm we see
all of the Novices just standing outside their rooms and
watching in total shock At the same time as Sisters Anne
and Kate go in and out of each room so violently
removing and then SMASHING all the girls’ MIRRORS

We see all these pieces of broken mirrors thrown down
into PILE ON THE FLOOR

SISTER CANDACE
Why are they taking our mirrors away

The others just keep watching and shrug Beat

REVEREND MOTHER (0S)
The Novitiate as I am sure youve all
heard many times

EXT COURTYARD - DAY

In the courtyard the new Novices walk toward the chapel
in perfect unison moving as one like some elite and
highly trained unit of an army

REVEREND MOTHER (0S)
Is commonly understood to be the most
grueling and demanding period in any
nun’s life And let me assure you
youre experience wont be any different

At the same time as a couple of ‘new’ Postulants who
happen to be walking in the Novices path jump to move
out of the way

INT NOVICE ASSEMBLY ROOM - EVENING

Inside a dimly lit and chillingly silent room all the
novices are now all crouched on their knees facing each
other in one large circle

Reverend Mother is also there walking through and amongst
all the girls looking down at them so intimidatingly

REVEREND MOTHER
It is now when all your so called
vocations will be tested to their
limits It is also about learning to be
perfect

(MORE)

REVEREND MOTHER (CONTD)
Because and I hope you’d all agree our
Savior deserves no less from each of you -
Than the gift of a perfect wife

Reverend Mother finally moves to a chair at the head of
the room sits down and stares at them all

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
So each week we’ll be meeting in this
room for an exercise called ‘Chapter of
Faults’ I myself will also always be
here with you during every ‘Chapter’
And one thing I can assure you we don’t
ever leave this room until the Chapter is
finished

Peering around at all the girls we see how completely
terrified they all already are

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
Let’s get started

Reverend Mother then looks around for a moment before
she finally turns and looks directly at Sister Evelyn

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
You Sister

SISTER EVELYN
Me Evelyn I’m Sister Evelyn

REVEREND MOTHER
Evelyn can you come here to the center
of the room here please

Without raising her eyes Evelyn shuffles across the
floor on her knees stops dead center in the middle of
the circle

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
Now if you wouldn’t mind Sister- I want
you to think about it for a moment and
then I want you to carefully list out
every single fault you’re aware in
yourself in front of all your sisters

Evelyn is clearly completely baffled and confused by
these instructions

SISTER EVELYN
I’m sorry what I don’t understand
REVEREND MOTHER
You don’t understand What don’t you
understand Are you perfect

SISTER EVELYN
No I don’t know What do you mean

REVEREND MOTHER
I mean are you a perfect person A
perfect human being A perfect nun

SISTER EVELYN
No I’m not perfect

REVEREND MOTHER
Well wouldn’t you like to be perfect
Don’t you think it’s important to always
at least try to be perfect

SISTER EVELYN
Yes I mean yes if I could

REVEREND MOTHER
Okay so what do you think it is Sister
Evelyn that most stands in the way
between you and perfection

SISTER EVELYN
My My My faults I guess

REVEREND MOTHER
Correct Because there’s really no way
for any of us to achieve perfection in
ourselves is there Without getting rid
of all our faults first

SISTER EVELYN
I guess so

REVEREND MOTHER
You guess what sister

SISTER EVELYN
Yes I mean yes Mother I agree

REVEREND MOTHER
So let’s hear it Tell us your faults

More closely on Evelyn her body begins to tremble a bit

SISTER EVELYN

I’m untidy What I mean is I’m messy
Like sometimes when I look around my
cell with all my clothes all over the
floor I feel like I’m such a slob and I
need to do better I space out a lot
too they used to call me ‘space cadet’
in school because I spaced out so much

REVEREND MOTHER
Woah woah woah Hold up hold up

Evelyn pauses just halts mid sentence

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
Leaving clothes on the floor Lack of
concentration or ‘spacing out’ as you
call it- While I agree these are all
points of weakness in you- As far as
faults go they’re also quite
superficial and not going to get us very
far in this process Let’s start again
and this time I want you to fully examine
your conscience tell us everything you
do on a daily basis to fail our Lord
Christ

We peer again at all the others from one face to the
next as all of them grow more frightened and disturbed

Beat

SISTER EVELYN
The ways I fail I fail Christ

A long silent pause as Evelyn slowly begins to cry

SISTER EVELYN (CONT’D)
Theres part of me that wonders if I’m
good enough to be here If I deserve to
be here or deserve anything good that
happens to me I want to be good to be
pure and good But I don’t know if
that’s who I really am on the inside And
sometimes my thoughts inside don’t always
match how I act on the outside And
sometimes I feel like I’m ugly and bad
inside And I know Ive let people
down before too I’ve let my parents down
before my ma and my dad But I dont
want to let him down Mother I don’t want
to let Jesus down I dont want to fail
him ever And I just hope he knows
that I can do better if he lets me

Evelyn then stops shaking uncontrollably and crying

REVEREND MOTHER
(more softly)
Okay okay Thank you Evelyn That was
very brave of you thank you

SISTER EVELYN
(almost inaudible)
Thank you Mother

As Evelyns body finally relaxes we see the tiniest hint
of a smile on her face more relief than anything else

REVEREND MOTHER
Now for your penance I’m going to assign
you 10 Hail Mary’s this week And Id
like you to fast all day Friday

SISTER EVELYN
Yes Mother thank you Mother

Evelyn then starts to shuffle back to her place in line

REVEREND MOTHER
Wait a minute where are you going

Evelyn stops freezes completely confused

SISTER EVELYN
I’m sorry I thought I was done

REVEREND MOTHER
Done No you’re not done Did you hear
me say you were done Come back here

Still halted Evelyn finally shuffles back to the center
just Reverend Mother turns to the group at large

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
Now that Evelyn’s been brave enough to
share some these faults in herself with
all of us- I’d like to open it up to the
rest of you Can I have a volunteer
please to help point out any additional
flaws they too have observed in Evelyn

Longer Beat Everybody is dead silent completely caught
off guard unsure what to do

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
Someone please speak weve already
established she’s not perfect
Continued silence no one wants to talk

Beat

SISTER CANDACE
I saw her smile

REVEREND MOTHER
(turning to Candace)
What

SISTER CANDACE
Just now when you said she did a good
job I saw her smile Like she was
pleased with herself like it was all a
joke to her

Reverend Mother turns again to Evelyn

REVEREND MOTHER
Evelyn is that true

Evelyn just continues to stare at the floor trembling

SISTER EVELYN
No I mean how would she even know what
I did if she hadn’t broken Custody of
the Eyes to look at me

Before suddenly Candace yells at her

SISTER CANDACE
I didn’t You’re vain

With Evelyn yelling back

SISTER EVELYN
You did You’re a liar That’s a fault
too

REVEREND MOTHER
Quiet Evelyn your turn is over you
don’t speak anymore More importantly
if you really had the nerve to mock this
process- That’s pathetic What kind of
nun do you plan on being if you can’t
even get through a moment of self-
examination without gloating This is
called the sin of pride and I’m going to
correct it in each of you starting with
you Sister Evelyn In addition to your
other penance I want you to use the
Discipline on yourself

There’s a long silent overwhelmingly tense pause
Moving from face to face we see how traumatized the
girls are Terrified to speak again Evelyn then finally
asks

SISTER EVELYN
The what

INT NOVITIATE DORMITORY STAIRCASE - DAY

A quiet empty stairwell as Evelyn Charlotte and Candace
all sit together on the stairs Evelyn is also
hysterically crying both girls just looking at her

SISTER CHARLOTTE
Was it really that bad

Evelyn just shakes her head

SISTER EVELYN
What do you think

SISTER CHARLOTTE
You don’t have to stay here you know
none of us do you could leave anytime
you wanted

SISTER EVELYN
And do what Tell my parents and everyone
back home that I failed at being a nun

Clearly guilt ridden by her prior accusations Candace
then turns to Evelyn so empathetically

SISTER CANDACE
Sister I’m so sorry I’m so sorry for
the things I said I don’t think you’re
vain at all

Evelyn herself turns to Candace sweetly
SISTER EVELYN
It’s okay Sister I know I don’t think
youre a liar I’m sorry too
INT REFECTORY - DAY
With the entire community once again gathered for the

afternoon meal suddenly Sister Genevieve stands and
begins clinking her fork on a glass addressing the room

Blue Rev (mmddyy) 68

REVEREND MOTHER
Sisters may I have your attention
please As of today we have a new member
Sister Emanuel joining our community
Sister Emanuel was previously a member of
the Sisters of Christ in New Hampshire
But as she felt the culture of the Roses
was more suited to her religious needs
she’s decided to transfer here She’1l be
joining as a second year Novice

At the Novice table all the girls immediately turn and
look towards the podium a mutual air of shock

Following their gaze we then see a very beautiful
devout looking young woman of 24 standing beside Sister
Genevieve - SISTER EMANUEL

Cathleen too then casually steals a glance at the new
sister although doesn’t seem to show much interest

INT CHAPEL - AFTERNOON

Inside the dead silence of the Chapel all the new
novices are lined up at the foot of the Altar given a
special communion by Father Luca And as we slowly PAN
across moving from one girl to the next one open mouth
to the next- a strange sort of tension begins to build

EXT RURAL CONVENT GROUNDS - AFTERNOON

On a sunny afternoon Sister Cathleen and Sister Emily
sit alone together in a tall field of swaying grass

SISTER EMILY
It just gets to me you know Like I just
think of how young we still are All the
things we could be doing if we weren’t
stuck in here in the Novitiate All my
friends back home they’re all just doing
normal teenage stuff- Going to drive-in
movies going roller skating watching
the fireworks on the 4th of July going
on dates with boys Even

SISTER CATHLEEN
Even what

Emily pauses for a moment afraid to even say the word
Blue Rev (mmddyy) 69

SISTER EMILY
(she whispers it)
You know Sex

Cathleen just looks at her shocked then immediately
starts blushing

SISTER EMILY (CONT’D)
You can’t tell me you’ve never thought
about it Everybody does even nuns they
just never talk about it

SISTER CATHLEEN
But how do you know that How do you know
nuns think about it

SISTER EMILY
Because everybody does It’s normal More
normal than you think

SISTER CATHLEEN
But I don’t think about it

Emily just looks at her
SISTER EMILY
You never kissed a boy before you came
here nothing like that
Cathleen shakes her head

SISTER CATHLEEN
Did you

SISTER EMILY
Once It was nice actually I bet youd
like it too
Cathleen suddenly blushes even harder
SISTER CATHLEEN
I don’t know It’s like Reverend Mother
says our bodies are just a distraction
They’re both silent again Emily stares off seeming
suddenly ashamed

INT REFECTORY - DAY

Music begins to drift in as held alone in a single
frame Sister Candace gives a reading before the meal
Blue Rev (mmddyy) 70

SISTER CANDACE
Let him kiss me with the kisses of his
mouth For your love is better than wine
your anointing oils are fragrant your
name is oil poured out on me therefore
virgins love you Draw me after you let
us run

INT NOVICE ASSEMBLY ROOM - EVENING

Returning to another Chapter of Faults the room is dead
silent as Reverend Mother just looks around at all the
girls her eyes moving from girl to girl Her eyes then
finally land on Cathleen

REVEREND MOTHER
Sister Cathleen

Stunned Cathleen is momentarily frozen Before she
finally shuffles across the floor to the center of the
room

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
What faults would you like to share with
us this evening Cathleen

Cathleen pauses It takes her a long time

SISTER CATHLEEN
Sometimes Sometimes wish that I could
be more loved back What I mean is I
wish I knew for sure that we all knew
for sure that he really loves us back as
much as we love him I wish I could
feel it more

There’s a long pause everyone waiting on Reverend
Mother’s reaction to this But this time Reverend Mother
seems softer more tolerant

REVEREND MOTHER
(consolingly)
Don’t wish for things you shouldn’t
sister Because that means you’re
questioning God’s will

INT SISTER CATHLEEN’S NOVICE CELL - NIGHT

Alone and in her cell at night Cathleen is now knelt on
the floor in her nightgown and praying
Blue Rev (mmddyy) 71

SISTER CATHLEEN
Thank you so much for everything today
Lord for showing me how to be a better
Novice I’m so sorry for ever questioning
or doubting you

MOMENTS LATER Cathleen undresses out of her habit and
into her nightgown And again for the brief moment that
she finds herself nude she struggles to hide her own
body from herself

INT SISTER CATHLEEN’S NOVICE CELL - NIGHT
MUCH LATER the room is now shrouded in darkness

As Cathleen is also deep asleep she gradually begins to
toss and turn in bed somewhat restless until it
gradually mutates into something else entirely

Still deep in sleep Cathleen unconsciously begins to
breathe somewhat heavily then slowly moves her hand
between legs beneath the blanket clearly aroused
masturbating without knowing It goes on for a minute or
two as she remains asleep the whole time

Before Cathleen then suddenly jolts up and awake
completely startled Breathing so heavily and desperately
she just looks down at her hands We then move in on her
face and eyes her terrified expression It’s literally
as if she has no idea what just happened but only knows
it’s bad

EXT CONVENT GROUNDS - MORNING

Gazing at the cloister from a distance the first MORNING
BELL begins to chime

INT SISTER CATHLEEN’S NOVICE CELL - MORNING

Seeming as if she has been up all night and so wracked
with guilt and worry- Cathleen is knelt beside her bed
struggling to pray

SISTER CATHLEEN
(whispering)
I’m so sorry Lord I’m so sorry I’m so
sorry I’m so sorry
Blue Rev (mmddyy) 72

INT CHAPEL - MORNING

In the midst of morning Mass the novices are all seated
together in their pews As the Priest then beckons the
entire congregation to pray we focus on Cathleen who’s
still so distracted she forgets to lower her head Seated
beside her Sister Charlotte notices and gently nudges
her Cathleen looks up confused Charlotte then shoots
her a look like “Everyones praying”

INT REFECTORY - DAY

Inside the refectory the entire community all eat in
silence Except for Cathleen who simply stares down at
her plate of food as if it disgusts her As if not eating
might somehow absolve her secret crippling guilt

Across the table Sister Emanuel happens to glance at
Cathleen and then down at her plate She seems to be the
only one who notices

As a Postulant then finally comes around to collect
everyone’s plate Cathleen hands hers over full and
untouched

INT REVEREND MOTHERS PRIVATE CHAPEL - AFTERNOON

Inside Reverend Mother’s small private chapel she kneels
on the floor deeply praying There’s then a KNOCK at the
door with Sister Genevieve peeking her head

Reverend Mother turns confused

SISTER GENEVIEVE
Excuse me Mother sorry to bother you

REVEREND MOTHER
What is it

SISTER GENEVIEVE
The Archbishop is here to see you

Now Reverend Mother’s face suddenly looks a bit panicked
she clearly wasn’t expecting this

REVEREND MOTHER
What What do you mean he’s here He’s
here now

SISTER GENEVIEVE
Yes I’m afraid so
Blue Rev (mmddyy) 73

INT MOTHERHOUSE RECEPTION ROOM - AFTERNOON

A WIDE SHOT from across the enormous room as we see the
silhouette of a man waiting by himself Reverend Mother
then hurries into the room to greet him

MOMENTS LATER they are seated across a small table from
one and other a tea set placed between them ARCHBISHOP
McCARTHY is also so exquisitely powerful and composed
while Reverend Mother actually seems a bit nervous and
fidgety

ARCHBISHOP
So how are you Marie You well You seem
a bit on edge

REVEREND MOTHER
Do I Maybe it’s just because I havent
been in the presence of a man in awhile
It’s unusual for me

The Archbishop laughs out loud at this While Reverend
Mother just looks confused she doesn’t know what’s
funny

ARCHBISHOP
Do you know why I’m here

REVEREND MOTHER
No I do not

ARCHBISHOP
You have no idea why I’m here

REVEREND MOTHER
I don’t no

ARCHBISHOP
Let’s put it like this- I’ve been hearing
a lot recently about how this order in
particular is having difficulty
embracing some of the changes put forth
by the Second Vatican Council Vatican
II Now you tell me is that accurate

Suddenly Reverend Mother seems even more fidgety

REVEREND MOTHER
Right Vatican II Accurate to a point
Some changes we’ve adopted Others we
havent

ARCHBISHOP
And would you care to elaborate on that
Blue Rev (mmddyy) 74

REVEREND MOTHER
(growing defiant)
Not really To be perfectly honest most
of the memos I’ve received from your
office only used the word “suggestion”
In regards to all these ridiculous
reforms we’re suddenly supposed to

ARCHBISHOP
How amusing I think you’re the only one
who missed the subtext there For most of
us the word “suggestion” is understood
as synonymous with “obligation”

REVEREND MOTHER
Maybe I’m just not that attuned to
subtext My apologies Are we done here

Reverend Mother begins to get up but he makes it clear
she better sit back down

ARCHBISHOP
No we’re not done What exactly are
you having the most difficulty with Why
don’t you lay it out for me

REVEREND MOTHER
I have no difficulty with it I just
happen to disagree with it All of it
Not to mention it’s a bit of a slap in
the face that the sisters weren’t given
any voice in the matter

The Archbishop laughs again and she again doesn’t know
what’s so funny

ARCHBISHOP
You really expected them to have a voice
the sisters

REVEREND MOTHER
Were a part of this church too

ARCHBISHOP
Marie come on

REVEREND MOTHER
With all due respect I just don’t think
you really understand what this is going
to do to us Because it’s going to ruin
us If we were really to embrace all
these changes- I guarantee you it’1l
destroy the very institution of Catholic
nuns as we know it
Beat The Archbishop is still not moved

ARCHBISHOP
Now are you still encouraging all your
Postulants and Novices to perform extreme
penances on themselves All that old
medieval stuff Because that’s gotta
stop

Reverend Mother just shakes her head

REVEREND MOTHER
I never asked any of my girls to do
anything for God that I wouldn’t do
myself

ARCHBISHOP
Like I said it’s gotta stop And as
for the rest of Rome’s recommendations- I
just hope you’ll keep an open mind try
to see them all together as part of a
larger theme The theme is change
adaptation spiritual evolution Do me
a favor just try and open your mind to
this Otherwise I may “suggest” we find
a replacement for you

The Archbishop then slowly rises and starts to head for
the door But just as he reaches it he turns back

ARCHBISHOP (CONTD)
You know you really should smile more

REVEREND MOTHER
Excuse me

ARCHBISHOP
You should smile more women are so much
prettier when they smile

Reverend Mother just glares

REVEREND MOTHER
I’m not a woman I’m a nun

ARCHBISHOP
Is there a difference

And now she glares at him even harder

REVEREND MOTHER
There used to be

INT NOVITIATE ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

Yet another “Chapter of Faults” as all the Novices kneel
in silence with Sister Emily in the center

SISTER EMILY
I never thought I’d say this but there
are times when I question if God is
real It’s so horrible I know But
what scares me to think is what if he
doesn’t really exist

Turning to Reverend Mother we see how completely checked
out she seems as if her thoughts are literally miles
away

SISTER EMILY (CONT’D)
What if he’s just something we all made
up one day then everybody started
believing it All the things we do for
him everything we all put ourselves
through how we push ourselves and push
ourselves to live only in his image If
it ever turned out that God didn’t really
exist- Then who would we all be doing it
for

Turning back to Reverend Mother it takes a moment for
her to even realize Emily has finished Everybody waiting
on her word she finally checks back into the present

REVEREND MOTHER
Sister Emily you seem to like to come in
here week after week making the same
pathetic confessions of your wavering
faith Again and again and again
Frankly I think we’ve all grown tired of
having to listen to this ongoing saga of
your complete and utter spiritual
wretchedness For your penance I’m
assigning you no penance at all Why
bother it’s a complete waste of my time

At which point Reverend Mother just gets up and walks
straight out of the room leaving all the girls in shock

Beat Everybody just looks around

EXT CONVENT GROUNDS - AFTERNOON

A large clothes line is hung with a small group of
Novices busying themselves doing laundry
Glancing across the courtyard Sister Emily then happens
to notice Sister Emanuel walking by herself head down
minding her own business

Emily shoots a look over to Sister Candace as the girls
start whispering

SISTER EMILY
I just don’t understand who she is or
what she’s even doing here

SISTER CANDACE
Apparently the S0C’s weren’t strict
enough for her I guess she came here for
all the extra self punishment

SISTER EMILY
Are you serious Does she really think
she’s that holy

They both giggle out loud then stop themselves

INT REFECTORY - AFTERNOON

Back in the dining hall and while everyone around her
eats Cathleen just stares down poking and picking at
another PLATE OF FOOD Emanuel again seems to be the
only one that notices

Cathleen then happens to catch Emanuel looking at her
who quickly turns away It’s awkward

INT REV MOTHER’S HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

Looking down the long hallway Cathleen sits alone on the
bench outside Reverend Mother’s office waiting

We move in CLOSER on her clearly anxious expression
Then to her HANDS fussing and fidgeting in her lap

Finally the door to Reverend Mother’s office opens with
Reverend Mother peeking out She turns to Cathleen

REVEREND MOTHER
You can come in
INT REVEREND MOTHER’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Cathleen and Reverend Mother now sit across the desk from
each other Reverend Mother stares at her curiously

Blue Rev (mmddyy) 78

REVEREND MOTHER
What did you want to see me about
sister

Cathleen can barely even get the words out

SISTER CATHLEEN
I was just wondering if If I could use
the Discipline just for the night

Caught off guard Reverend Mother then slowly looks up
and much more directly at Cathleen

REVEREND MOTHER
The Discipline Why

SISTER CATHLEEN
If it’s okay with you I’d rather not
say

REVEREND MOTHER
It’s not okay I can’t just give it to
you without knowing what you want it for
first

A long pause Cathleen struggles so hard to think of what
to say

CATHLEEN
No I know I broke Grande Silence
twice this week I was also

uncharitable to one of my sisters when I
didn’t mean to be

Now Reverend Mother looks at Cathleen with more interest
as if actually noticing her for the very first time

REVEREND MOTHER
That’s what you want to punish yourself
for

Cathleen nods Reverend Mother continues to look at her

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
Honestly

Cathleen nods again Reverend Mother then opens a drawer
removing the small knotted WHIP from her desk She slides
it across to Cathleen

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
Be careful it’s not a toy

Cathleen slowly takes it begins to get up
Blue Rev (mmddyy) 79

SISTER CATHLEEN
Thank you Mother

Keeping her eyes on Cathleen Reverend Mother watches her
leave with intensified curiosity

INT SISTER CATHLEEN’S NOVICE CELL - NIGHT

Knelt by herself on the floor Cathleen slowly and
meticulously begins to pull her habit over her head She
stares at the floor for a long beat clearly so utterly
terrified about what she’s about to do

Finally she reaches down and grabs the Discipline off the
floor takes a deep breath and begins to whip herself

She hits herself very very hard CRACK CRACK CRACK
And with each and every crack we can hear her muffled
yelps and moans of pain And yet she keeps going just
gritting her teeth and trying to get through it

Cathleen whips herself about 10 times then finally
stops

HARD TO BLACK

FADE UP

EXT CONVENT GARDEN - AFTERNOON

On a beautiful sunny afternoon Cathleen sits on a bench
by herself reading the Bible Suddenly Sister Genevieve
then walks across the courtyard to her

SISTER GENEVIEVE
Excuse me Sister but your Mother’s here
to see you

Cathleen then looks up staring at Genevieve confused
SISTER CATHLEEN
What What do you mean Why would my

mother be here it’s not visiting day

Sister Genevieve looks around to see if anyone’s
watching She whispers something into Cathleen’s ear
INT HALLWAY —- DAY

Following behind Genevieve Cathleen starts towards the
main nun’s door of the Family Room but then Genevieve
stops her motioning elsewhere

SISTER GENEVIEVE
It’s okay Reverend Mother said youre
allowed to use the other door today

Cathleen then follows her through the alternate door

INT FAMILY RECEPTION ROOM - DAY

As Cathleen enters she immediately sees Nora standing
there and waiting wearing an odd expression And we can
tell Cathleen’s not happy about it

She slowly walks to her mom with Nora at once trying to
hug her But instead Cathleen freezes

NORA
Is there somewhere can we talk I got
something I gotta tell you

SISTER CATHLEEN
(motioning to Genevieve)
It’s okay she already told me

Confused for a moment Nora then turns and glares at
Genevieve She takes another step toward Cathleen

NORA
No one knew he had it Guess it had been
a few years now and he just kept it to
himself And I know he wasn’t ever much
a father to you honey but it’s probably
still kind of a shock That’s why I came
I didn’t want you to be alone

SISTER CATHLEEN
But I’m not alone And you really didn’t
have to come

Taken aback Nora looks at Cathleen like she barely
recognizes her

NORA
What is that supposed to mean I came
here for you It doesn’t upset you to
hear your dad passed away

Cathleen just shrugs her shoulders

NORA (CONTD)
(searching Cathleen’s eyes)

Wait a minute what’s going on here What

the hell is going on I’m serious

Cathleen What is this

SISTER CATHLEEN
Nothing’s going on Mom I’m sorry you’re
upset okay

Nora then gradually begins to get angry but it’s an
anger masking a much deeper concern

NORA
Well I’m sorry you’re not What the hell
is going on And why have you lost a
bunch of weight

Cathleen just looks at the floor averting Nora’s gaze

NORA (CONT’D)
You look really thin How much weight
have you lost Why are you so thin

CATHLEEN
Mom I’m fine Please I haven’t lost
that much weight

NORA
How much weight have you lost What’s
going on they don’t feed you in here
Let me see your hands show me your arms

Nora then reaches to grab Cathleen’s arm at the same
time as Cathleen immediately and violently jerks it back

CATHLEEN
I’m fine okay I have to go now I’m
sorry about Dad I really am I’1l pray
that God meets him in grace okay

NORA
What You have to go now

Cathleen stares at her hard

CATHLEEN
I’m sorry I have to go okay

She then immediately turns and leaves not looking back
for a second

NORA
Cathleen What Cathleen Cathleen

But she’s gone once again leaving Nora in a complete
state of shock and feeling more distanced than ever from
her daughter

Nora then turns again to Sister Genevieve who’s been
standing there the whole time

NORA (CONTD)

Excuse me what’s the name of that Mother
Superior lady woman who runs this
place

SISTER GENEVIEVE
Reverend Mother You mean Reverend
Mother

NORA
Yeah her Can you take me to her please

INT REVEREND MOTHERS OFFICE - DAY

Reverend Mother sits behind with Nora across from her
All while Nora wears an almost explosive expression

REVEREND MOTHER
How are you Mrs Harris I don’t think
weve met

NORA
(not skipping a beat)
I’m fine Just want to know what’s going
on with my daughter that’s all

REVEREND MOTHER
I’m sorry what do you mean by that

NORA
Look Miss

REVEREND MOTHER
Mother

NORA
Excuse me

REVEREND MOTHER
It’s Mother Reverend Mother I’m not a
Miss or a Mrs for that matter

Nora just glares

NORA
Lady I’m not calling you Mother
Beat

REVEREND MOTHER
Mrs Harris I understand youve had a
loss in the family and I just want to
express

NORA
Save it You do know I haven’t seen my
daughter in nearly 6 months- I came here
today to tell her about her Dad and I
barely even recognize her She looks
completely different like she’s lost 20
pounds I want to know what you’re
doing to her in here

REVEREND MOTHER
Me What I’m doing This is about her
weight her body isn’t that a bit of a
superficial topic

NORA
Are you blind Have you seen her lately
She looks like she’s dying

REVEREND MOTHER
Please calm down

NORA
Like she’s dying I said I want to know
what’s going on in here

Reverend Mother just looks at Nora takes a long beat

REVEREND MOTHER
Honestly with all due respect Mrs
Harris in a sense you did bring your
daughter here to die You brought her
here to die to the outside world be
reborn again in Christ’s love She’s
just going through a process that’s
all For whatever it’s worth I do
understand how hard it is for any parent
to give their child to God

NORA
Oh really do you And that’s because you
have children your own

Calm and cool as ever Reverend Mother then looks Nora
straight in the eyes

REVEREND MOTHER
No I’m afraid I do not But neither do
you anymore either

Reverend Mother stares and Nora stares back both so
enraged it’s like they could almost get in a fist fight
Nora then slowly rises not taking her eyes off her

NORA
Okay well just so you know and with all
due respect to you Miss Whatever-the-
fuck you want to be called by I didn’t
‘bring’ my daughter here I didn’t
‘bring’ her here at all But if I ever
come back and see her like this again- I
will take her out of here

Nora heads for the door but turns back once more

NORA (CONT’D)
You got that- Mother

She SLAMS the door behind her We hold on Reverend Mother
in a complete state of shock The pressure starting to
get to her

INT REFECTORY - EVENING

As Cathleen looks down to her plate to see a large hunk
of highly unappetizing meatloaf staring back at her we
can tell how incredibly difficult this is for her

We then notice Sister Genevieve across the room staring
straight at her watching her like a hawk Cathleen fully
aware she’s being watched

Ever so slowly Cathleen then finally begins to eat She
does so deliberately one bite after another One bite
after another One bite after

Before all out of nowhere Cathleen suddenly starts
gagging and grabbing at her stomach literally doubling
over She gets up to try and excuse herself but
immediately falls to the floor coughing and dry heaving
as her stomach tries to force her food back up All the
other novices instantly rush over to try and help

HARD TO BLACK

FADE UP
Blue Rev (mmddyy)

EXT CONVENT - EVENING

We watch a small group of Professed Sisters suddenly run
for cover as a heavy rain falls over the convent

INT INFIRMARY - NIGHT

Inside a small infirmary room we come to a CLOSE UP on
Cathleen fast asleep little sheets of rain from the
window outside reflecting over her face

After a moment a vague shadow then passes over her face

Now Cathleen suddenly jolts awake shocked to see none
other than Sister Emanuel standing over her She stares
at Emanuel for a long moment unsure if she’s dreaming

SISTER CATHLEEN
(in sign language)
What are you doing here

SISTER EMANUEL
(in sign language)
I didn’t mean to wake you Reverend
Mother asked me to check on you

Cathleen just looks at her Slowly propping herself up in
the bed

SISTER CATHLEEN
(in sign language)
Reverend Mother

SISTER EMANUEL
Yes And it’s okay we don’t have to
sign it’s not Grande Silence yet

Cathleen tries to roll over a bit but winces clearly her
stomach is still hurting her

SISTER EMANUEL (CONT’D)
Are you hungry Maybe you should eat
something They asked me to bring you
soup from the dining hall Hold on

Emanuel then walks across the room grabbing a small bowl
of soup she left by the door and hands it to Cathleen

SISTER CATHLEEN
Thank you Sister

Cathleen sits up further and they look at each other
Cathleen then closes her eyes to pray and Emanuel waits

Blue Rev (mmddyy)

SISTER CATHLEEN (CONT’D)
So you’re from the S0OC’s right What
happened you didn’t like it there

Emanuel suddenly looks a bit self-conscious as if she
doesn’t particularly like answering this question

SISTER EMANUEL
It’s not that I didn’t like it I just
thought it would be better for me to be a
Rose Thought it would be easier

SISTER CATHLEEN
Easier But aren’t Roses so much
stricter

SISTER EMANUEL
Sometimes when things are stricter that
makes it easier I mean for me I guess

SISTER CATHLEEN
I wouldn’t know All I ever wanted was to
be a Rose

SISTER EMANUEL
Youre really good at it aren’t you

SISTER CATHLEEN
At what

SISTER EMANUEL
Being a nun What I mean is it just
seems to come so naturally to you

Cathleen pauses as if she’s never given it much thought

SISTER CATHLEEN
Not always But I know I want God’s love
and if being a good nun is what it takes
for me to deserve God’s love then

Beat Emanuel thinks about it for a moment

SISTER EMANUEL
I admire you

SISTER CATHLEEN
What Me

SISTER EMANUEL
I admire your devotion How much you seem
to feel What you’re willing to go
through All the passion you feel it
seems so real with you

FH
Blue Rev (mmddyy)

SISTER CATHLEEN
Isn’t it with you too

Emanuel is about to answer before suddenly another BELL
begins to chime This one indicating the actual start of
Grande Silence

SISTER EMANUEL
(in sign language)
That’s Grande Silence I better go

Cathleen looks a bit disappointed but doesn’t show it
now watching her leave

SISTER CATHLEEN
Sister Emanuel

Emanuel turns

SISTER CATHLEEN (CONT’D)
(in sign language)
Thank you for coming

SISTER EMANUEL
(in sign language)
Youre welcome

INT CONVENT GROUNDS - MORNING

Yet again we watch all the novices in their silent
exquisite and disturbingly precise procession make
their way through the convent grounds towards morning
Mass

INT REVEREND MOTHER’S OFFICE - MORNING

Alone in her office Reverend Mother stares silently out
the window just watching the Novices with an oddly sad
expression We then look down to the window to another
mysterious and ominous ENVELOPE placed in front of her

INT CATHLEEN’S INFIRMARY ROOM - AFTERNOON

With her head resting sideways on the pillow Cathleen
slowly opens her eyes and looks across the room to see
Emanuel on the floor praying Cathleen just watches for a
moment oddly fascinated Before Emanuel turns and
Cathleen pretends she wasn’t watching

SISTER CATHLEEN
How long was I asleep for

Blue Rev (mmddyy)

SISTER EMANUEL
Not long You look better today Are you
feeling better

SISTER CATHLEEN
I think so A little

SISTER EMANUEL
Did you sleep well

Beat

SISTER EMANUEL (CONT’D)
Do you want me to help you change out of
your nightgown You’ve been wearing that
one for a few days now

Cathleen suddenly looks panicked it’s an awkward
question that she’s not quite sure how to respond to

SISTER CATHLEEN
Oh umm that’s okay I can do it myself

Understanding what she means now Emanuel looks
embarrassed

Emanuel then goes to the closet to find a nightgown She
hands it to Cathleen as Cathleen turns her body around so
she’s not facing her as she changes

Beat

SISTER EMANUEL
Maybe it’s a weird question- But why did
you do it Why did you starve yourself
like that make yourself sick Did you do
it for Christ

Cathleen looks caught off guard embarrassed She’s also
still partially unclothed

SISTER EMANUEL (CONT’D)
Sorry it’s none of my business

Cathleen finishes putting the nightgown on

SISTER CATHLEEN
You can turn around now it’s okay

Emanuel turns then goes and sits on the edge of the bed

SISTER CATHLEEN (CONT’D)
I thought I was doing it for Christ and
to be a better nun

Blue Rev

(mmddyy )

SISTER CATHLEEN (CONT’D)
But maybe I also thought if I made myself
starve on the outside somehow I wouldn’t
feel myself as much starving on the

inside

Emanuel just looks at her curiously

SISTER EMANUEL
But what are you starving for on the

inside I mean
Cathleen is speechless for a moment

SISTER CATHLEEN
I don’t know

SISTER EMANUEL
It really isn’t any of my business

SISTER CATHLEEN
It’s okay I’m just not used to talking
to other sisters this way

SISTER EMANUEL
What way

SISTER CATHLEEN
Just This way

SISTER EMANUEL
I know what you mean it’s kind of the
hardest thing about being a nun for me

SISTER CATHLEEN
What is

Emanuel looks at the ground for a moment then back up at
Cathleen

SISTER EMANUEL
Friendship

INT REVEREND MOTHER’S OFFICE - MORNING

Back in Reverend Mother’s office she finally reaches for
the envelope and opens it Inside is a small TWO PAGE
LETTER which she then begins to read

Watching her eyes read over the letter line by line
it’s as if each line makes her more and more upset even
devastated by whatever the letter is telling her
Blue Rev (mmddyy)

Reverend Mother then puts the letter back in the envelope
and just stares out the window before she at last begins
to pray

INT INFIRMARY - AFTERNOON

Back in the infirmary we hold a tight CLOSE UP on
Emanuel as she reads out loud to Cathleen

SISTER EMANUEL
Let not your hearts be troubled Believe
in God believe also in me In my
Father’s house are many rooms If it were
not so would I have told you that I go
to prepare a place for you

At the same time we begin to PUSH IN on Cathleen her
face and eyes as she listens Expressionless for a long
time all out of nowhere Cathleen begins to cry -
Completely confusing Emanuel

SISTER EMANUEL (CONT’D)
What’s wrong What happened Did I do
something wrong

Cathleen just stares at her through her tears barely
able to communicate Emanuel looks so confused not
knowing what to say

SISTER EMANUEL (CONT’D)
I don’t understand I don’t understand I
don’t mean to upset you

A beat passes with Emanuel totally frozen before
Cathleen gradually seems to regain herself

We then happen to notice Cathleen’s HAND fall along the
top of the bed with Emanuel’s eyes accidentally looking
toward it

They are silent for a beat Cathleen sniffling before
Emanuel looks at her so compassionately then almost
involuntarily reaches her hand over to gently hold
Cathleen’s

But then in an almost knee jerk and spontaneous reaction
Cathleen immediately YANKS her hand away

Silence It’s so awkward both of them so shocked
speechless and deeply uncomfortable
Blue Rev (mmddyy)

But then Cathleen gradually lays her hand back down
Before slowly tentatively exploringly inching her
fingers back across the fabric to touch the edges of
Emanuel’s fingers With each of their eyes turned
completely away Emanuel too gradually allows her fingers
to intertwine with Cathleen’s Until finally they are
fully holding hands Beat

Now all out of nowhere it’s Emanuel who suddenly jumps up
off the bed violently yanking her hand away panicked

SISTER EMANUEL (CONT’D)
Sorry That was a mistake I’m sorry Im
really sorry Don’t tell anyone please
That was a mistake

Cathleen tries to hide her shock and shame

SISTER CATHLEEN
No it’s my fault I’m sorry

SISTER EMANUEL
It’s okay I’m sorry I have to go now
okay

SISTER CATHLEEN
Okay I’m really sorry Sister

Emanuel then immediately rushes out of the room leaving
Cathleen alone and in shock

INT INFIRMARY HALLWAY - NIGHT

In the hall just outside the infirmary we watch Emanuel
start to hurry away Crying she at first walks then
suddenly picks up the pace to a run

INT REVEREND MOTHERS OFFICE - DAY

Returning to Reverend Mother she sits alone at her desk
with the huge STACK OF VATICAN II DOCUMENTS in front of
her just staring at them and staring at them

Then suddenly in a fit of wild emotion she begins to
grab all the papers and wildly throw them across the
room It’s as if she doesn’t even know what’s come over
her but can’t stop herself She’s so hurt and so angry

Blue Rev (mmddyy) 92

INT COURTYARD - DAY

As a heavy rain begins to fall we turn to find Sister
Emanuel now crawling by herself against the cold stone
ground She is literally soaked to the bone praying out
loud as she enacts her own penance desperate to punish
herself as much as possible

SISTER EMANUEL
Lord make me an instrument of Thy peace
where there is hatred let me sow love
where there is injury pardon where
there is doubt faith where there is
despair hope where there is darkness
light where there is sadness joy O
Divine Master grant that I may not so
much seek to be consoled as to console
to be understood as to understand to be
loved as to love Love love love
love love love

FADE OUT

FADE UP

NT REFECTORY - DAY

In the middle of the afternoon we find ALL OF THE ROSES
oddly gathered and waiting for something They all
whisper to each other looking around seeming as if they
have no idea what’s going on or why they’re there

At last Reverend Mother then enters from the front She
looks around for a beat slowly heads to the podium

As we watch Reverend Mother now standing there in front
of the entire group of Roses essentially her whole world
for so many years upon years we see how truly pained and
conflicted she is about what she’s about to do She takes
a deep sigh then looks up at them all so tenderly

REVEREND MOTHER
Sisters I have an announcement I
apologize this has taken me so long But
there is something very important I’ve
been meaning to discuss with all of
you I imagine by now at least a few
of you have heard of something called
Vatican II In a nutshell there have
been an ongoing series of meetings taking
place in Rome over the past 3 years

(MORE )

ee HF HH FH
Blue Rev (mmddyy)

REVEREND MOTHER (CONTD)
Meetings which have been principally
concerned with the current state of our
church And with certain revisions the
Pope and others felt necessary in order
to insure the survival of the church

We pan around to see the reactions of the utterly
confused community

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
For myself I could not be more pleased
with the results of Vatican II Or even
with the brave new direction in which the
church is now going Pope John XXIII was
nothing but visionary in terms of
Umm Ummm

Everybody still just looks around not quite sure where
any of this is going Reverend Mother just shakes her
head

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
Well let’s not belabor this I’m just
going to read you this memo from the
Archdiocese regarding a number of new
reforms that we will all be adopting as
of immediately

Reverend Mother then clears her throat pulling out the
same LETTER we saw her holding before She slowly
deliberately begins to read straight off the page

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
“From now on please be advised that
Priests are no longer required to read
the liturgy in Latin and should face the
congregation during Holy Mass All
Catholics are further encouraged to
embrace the idea of full and complete
religious tolerance While we may not
share the same beliefs as others we will
honor and respect each and every
individual’s belief as their own not
persecute others on the basis of their
beliefs Please be advised also that
all nuns and women religious cloistered
and non cloistered are no longer
required to wear the traditional
religious habit as a symbol of their
lifelong matrimony to Christ In fact
they’re now free to wear what they
want”

Blue Rev (mmddyy)

At this many of the sisters look around at each other a
mutual air of shock “What did she just say”

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
Regarding the culture of more extreme
abnegation and self-punishment still
prevalent in many of our communities
today- Please be advised that according
to the council this is no longer
understood to be the appropriate path to
follow for all those seeking greater
union with Christ It is no longer
acceptable to view any acts of suffering
self-punishment or extreme sacrifice -
as an act of love or way to gain favor
with our Lord We as Catholics need to
learn to understand love in a different
way Finally from here forward and in
the eyes of both the church and God
alike the status of all nuns will be
reduced as equal to that of any regular
practicing Catholic While the choice to
enter the convent remains one’s own this
does not necessarily make nuns any more
‘beloved’ or ‘special’ in God’s eyes

We hear a few GASPS through the room before everyone is
suddenly silent Total devastation A few sisters then
begin to cry

All while Reverend Mother just looks at them all so
sadly compassionately Perhaps more than anything else
maternally Like a Mother that feels she’s failed and let
her children down

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
I’m so very sorry sisters Enjoy the rest
of your day
INT INFIRMARY - NIGHT
Back in the infirmary it is now very late at night

Cathleen tosses and turns in bed for a moment then sits
up staring pensively off into the darkness

INT CHAPEL - NIGHT

With the world hushed and the entire convent gone to
sleep suddenly the doors to the chapel are PUSHED RIGHT
OPEN Reverend Mother charging inside and heading
straight for the altar

ee HF HF HF HF HF HF

Blue Rev (mmddyy) 95

MOMENTS LATER Reverend Mother now lays herself across
the foot of the altar staring up so desperately at the
ICON OF CHRIST that looms above Seeming like a woman
who’s lost all footing in the world She begins to
whisper to God to herself to whatever’s out there that
might still hear her

REVEREND MOTHER
Where are you Where are you What
happened to us You were always there
for so long right there next to me I
could feel you with me together with me
all the time My darling husband Then
one day you start leaving me Leaving
me and leaving me all alone to face this
on my own

Reverend Mother gradually begins to cry perhaps for the
first time in 40 years

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
I bet you think that means I’ve lost
faith in you too Because that’s what you
want You want me to lose faith to stop
believing in you so I’m the one who
leaves you first And then you don’t have
to worry about my pain Well guess
what I’m not doing it I made a
commitment to you 40 years ago and
whatever else happens even if you don’t
want me anymore even if you decide to
turn your back on me and leave me
forever I’m still not losing faith
Because you’re all I have and I need
you Everything is just so much harder to
face without you My Darling husband

She then rolls over on her back laying prostrated and
staring up at the ceiling looking everywhere for him
Hoping whatever she said might somehow bring him back

INT EMANUEL’S CELL - LATER

In the darkness of her tiny cell Emanuel lays fast
asleep before there’s a knock on her door and she wakes
up

Emanuel then walks half asleep to the door only to find
Cathleen standing there in the doorway staring right back
at her

They just stand there like that for a long time
Breathing so heavily Cathleen whispers in a shaky voice
Blue Rev (mmddyy)

SISTER CATHLEEN
Is it okay

SISTER EMANUEL
Youre not supposed to be here

But Cathleen doesn’t move just stays where she is

Emanuel goes back to her bed and sits with Cathleen
following and sitting on the other end of the bed from
her They are dead silent for a long beat

SISTER EMANUEL (CONT’D)
What do you want from me

Tears well in Cathleen’s eyes so confused by her own
emotions she doesn’t know how to express it Long pause

SISTER CATHLEEN
Do you remember Do remember before
when you asked what I was starving for

Emanuel turns away and looks at the floor

SISTER CATHLEEN (CONT’D)
I just want you to comfort me that’s
all I just want you to comfort me
Please Will you please comfort me
sister

Emanuel looks at her again tears welling in her own
eyes

SISTER EMANUEL
I can’tdo that

SISTER CATHLEEN
Please please Please just comfort me
Please just comfort me

They turn to face it each other fully now

SISTER CATHLEEN (CONT’D)
Just comfort me please comfort me
Comfort me Comfort me Comfort me

Unable to stop herself Cathleen then slides across the
bed so that her face is only inches away from Emanuel’s
She is fully crying now Emanuel quietly panic stricken

SISTER EMANUEL
Shhhh don’t cry Okay okay I will
I’1l comfort you okay please just stop
talking stop crying

Blue Rev (mmddyy)

SISTER CATHLEEN
Please please please

Emanuel reaches her hand up and into Cathleen’s mouth
gently pushing her fingers all around and in between her
lips Cathleen let’s her forehead fall to rest against
Emanuel’s now breathing even more heavily

SISTER CATHLEEN (CONT’D)
(barely audible)
Please just comfort me Please just
comfort me Please just comfort me
Please just comfort me

They then gradually begin to kiss At first so timidly
as if it is possibly the first time for both of them
Then a little more freely Then more intensely Then more
passionately Then more and more passionately Cathleen
unable to stop crying as it happens

SISTER CATHLEEN (CONT’D)
I just want you to comfort me Please
please please Just comfort me
Please just comfort me

INT REVEREND MOTHERS OFFICE - DAY

Before we again find ourselves back in Reverend Mother’s
office with she and Cathleen sitting directly opposite
each other

Cathleen is clearly very nervous silent for a long time
unable to look at Reverend Mother for fear of being found
out Beat

REVEREND MOTHER
I take it you’re feeling better

SISTER CATHLEEN
I am yes thank you

REVEREND MOTHER
Even though I wouldn’t recommend it- I
appreciate the devotion you showed
starving yourself for Christ

Cathleen just looks at the ground

SISTER CATHLEEN
Thank you Mother

REVEREND MOTHER
Well there aren’t going to be any
surprises A few bumps here and there
but you’ve mostly been exceptional in
your training here I really believe
you belong here with us Sister doesn’t
that make you happy

Oddly expressionless Cathleen just nods

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
You don’t seem happy

SISTER CATHLEEN
(unsure)
No of course I am I’m happy

Reverend Mother stares at her almost compassionately
Almost as if longing for some connection with her

REVEREND MOTHER
I don’t know how much you’ve heard about
Vatican II

Cathleen looks up surprised

SISTER CATHLEEN
Not much Just some things I’ve heard
here and there from some of the others

Reverend Mother tries to think of how to say it growing
even more emotional and confessional

REVEREND MOTHER
You know when I first came here when I
first came to this convent all those
years ago now I had nothing

Cathleen looks again Unsure how to handle her sudden
candor and intimacy

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
Nothing No home no family no one to
look after me Nothing And the
church the church was the only thing to
ever hold me The only thing to ever
embrace me The church gave me my life
my work my community even my
identity

Cathleen just stares at her a strange moment of
connection as if they both understand each other more
deeply than they thought

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
Don’t you see Now Vatican II wants to
take all that away Vatican II wants to
invalidate all that for all of us
saying none of it matters That nothing
we do matters anymore But then my
question is - What is it that really does
still matter

Reverend Mother just stares at Cathleen who stares back
at her We hold on them looking at each other like this

EXT CONVENT COLONNADE - AFTERNOON

We hear the sound of the mid afternoon bell as Cathleen
is now walking by herself back through the colonnade At
the same time and coming in the opposite direction is
Sister Emanuel

Cathleen and Emanuel then cross in the middle all while
both maintain such rigidity in their ‘Custody of the
Eyes’ it’s hard to tell if they even see each other

Then suddenly Cathleen stops turns and looks at Emanuel

SISTER CATHLEEN
Sister

Emanuel turns and looks at her too but with such vacancy
in her eyes such total absence it’s hard to tell if she
even recognizes her

SISTER EMANUEL
Yes Sister

They continue to look at each other As it’s gradually
clear Emanuel has no plans to knowledge her Emanuel then
turns and walks away Beat

SISTER CHARLOTTE (0S)
So many things have changed since we were
postulants I know that when I first
had my vocation that it was real it was
a real vocation

INT NOVITIATE ASSEMBLY ROOM - EVENING
We again find ourselves in another Chapter of Faults

Sister Charlotte on the floor confessing before the
group

SISTER CHARLOTTE
That it was really truly his voice
speaking to me I just don’t know
anymore if this is really what he was
calling me for Maybe he doesn’t need me
here anymore Maybe he wants something
else for me Maybe he never meant for me
to be a nun in the first place and
doesn’t care what I do He just wants me
to live my life and be a good person and
be happy Or maybe not

Reverend Mother is oddly calm She just stares at
Charlotte for a moment then shrugs

REVEREND MOTHER
Okay fine thank you sister For your
penance say 3 extra Hail Marys before
bed each night Do it quickly if you
like

Still staring at the ground Charlotte waits a beat then
shuffles back to her place Reverend Mother looks around
the room

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
Sister Cathleen come forward please

Cathleen looks up before she too shuffles to the center
of the room

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
Sister Cathleen do you have any
accusations you’d like to make against
yourself Any new faults you want to
share with us

Beat Cathleen is silent

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
Cathleen did you hear what I said
Faults - Do you have faults for us

SISTER CATHLEEN
Yes sorry I do I want to accuse
myself to accuse myself of of

But Cathleen seems so conflicted barely able to get any
words out Nearby Emanuel looks mortified

SISTER CATHLEEN (CONT’D)
I want to accuse myself of Accuse
myself of Having feelings

REVEREND MOTHER
Feelings What kind of feelings

SISTER CATHLEEN
Feelings I’m not sure I was supposed to
have Like wanting to be with another
person In a way that made me feel

REVEREND MOTHER
Feel what

SISTER CATHLEEN
Wanted Comforted Loved and I wanted
someone to touch me and to make me feel
something Something more than God can
give me

The whole room is silenced We again hold on Emanuel’s
face Reverend Mother looks angry

REVEREND MOTHER
More than God can give you what is that
supposed to mean

SISTER CATHLEEN
I don’t know

REVEREND MOTHER
(genuine shock)
What does that mean Explain yourself
Sister

Emanuel starts to tremble Cathleen just shakes her head

Silence

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
Explain it

SISTER CATHLEEN
But I don’t know how to explain it I’m
accusing myself of being intimate with
someone another sister and of feeling
love for her

A state of mutual shock then falls over the room

SISTER CATHLEEN (CONT’D)
And it I don’t think it was a sin
because it didn’t feel like a sin It
didn’t feel like a sin It felt more like
the way we’re supposed to feel

Cathleen seems like she’s about to cry her body shaking
and trembling yet somehow she won’t allow herself

REVEREND MOTHER
I don’t understand Were you intimate
with someone in this room Who Call her
out Call her out right now

We turn to Emanuel again she can barely take it

SISTER CATHLEEN
No Mother I’m not going to do that I
made my accusation like you asked Just
want my penance I just want my penance

REVEREND MOTHER
Cathleen what EXACTLY did you do And
with WHOM did you do it

Emanuel continues to remain stone faced

SISTER CATHLEEN
I’m not saying who Mother I just want to
do my penance Give me my penance

REVEREND MOTHER
I want to know who

Cathleen is still on the verge of tears but still won’t
cry

SISTER CATHLEEN
I just want to do my penance I just want
my penance I want to do my PENANCE

REVEREND MOTHER
You want your penance Cathleen

SISTER CATHLEEN
Yes Mother I do

REVEREND MOTHER
YOU WANT YOUR PENANCE CATHLEEN

SISTER CATHLEEN
YES MOTHER I DOOOOOOOOO

REVEREND MOTHER

OKAY THEN I WANT YOU TO CRAWL ACROSS THE
FLOOR TO EVERY SISTER HEAR AND BEG US
ALL FOR YOUR PENANCE

Cathleen is frozen Now she all at once begins to cry
hysterically

REVEREND MOTHER (CONT’D)
IF YOU REALLY WANT YOUR PENANCE THAT BAD
BEG FOR IT

Her body shaking like a leaf Cathleen then throws
herself onto her knees Weeping and crying she starts to
crawl along the floor stopping at the feet of each of
her sisters begging them all so desperately

SISTER CATHLEEN
I just want my penance Please give me my
penance I just want my penance I beg
you for my penance I just want my
penance I just want my penance I just
want my penance I just want my penance
I just want my penance I beg you I’m
begging you Please I beg you for it

All while Reverend Mother just watches along with the
others everyone in a mutual state of shock Some of the
girls are now crying others trembling and shaking
others just hoping it will all to be over soon

Before eventually Cathleen seems to totally collapse
literally imploding into herself like no more than a
frightened trembling ball on the floor

We then HOLD on Sister Emanuel one last time before she
at last begins to cry too

EXT REFECTORY - AFTERNOON

Looking at the line of sisters now waiting to enter the
dining hall we see how utterly emptied and diminished
the community has become As if nearly half the community
has disappeared in the blink of an eye

We hold briefly on Reverend Mother’s expression still
standing at the door still formally greeting each sister
as they pass - She tries to put on a brave face but it’s
clearly she’s broken inside

At the back of the line Sisters Emily and Evelyn also
whisper to each other

SISTER EMILY
Where is everyone

SISTER EVELYN
Gone

SISTER EMILY
Gone What did you mean gone
Blue Rev (mmddyy) 104

SISTER EVELYN
Didn’t you hear they all left Because
of Vatican II

INT CHAPEL SIDE ROOM - DAY

With the now only few remaining NOVICES all gathered in
the chapel atrium beside a small RACK OF AWAITING WEDDING
DRESSES suddenly Cathleen Evelyn and Candace hurry in

Fussing with the dresses Sister Anne looks up and glares
at them

SISTER ANNE
You 3 are late Is everyone here now Who
wants to be fitted first

Sister Anne hands Cathleen her dress as Sister Emily
randomly goes over to the rack starts looking over all
the dresses and counting to herself

SISTER EMILY
Why are there only 5 dresses Where’s
Sister Emanuel’s

SISTER ANNE
(nonchalant)
Sister Emanuel’s dress won’t be needed
anymore because Sister Emanuel has left
She’s not going to be taking vows with
the rest of you anymore

Suddenly they all turn just staring at Anne in shock

SISTER CHARLOTTE
Left What do you mean she left Where
did she go

Anne just looks annoyed

SISTER ANNE
I have no idea She just left that’s all
I know My guess is she just didn’t want
to be a nun anymore

As the others all look around at each other in disbelief
We turn to Cathleen who’s already off-kilter state of
confusion has just amplified tenfold

EXT CONVENT GROUNDS - DUSK

Night falls over the Convent as we hear the sound of the
Grande Silence BELL ring out over the landscape

INT SISTER CATHLEEN’S NOVICE CELL - EVENING

Alone in her room Cathleen is knelt down upon her floor
softly and intimately praying A halo of light outlines
her face

SISTER CATHLEEN
Lord dear Lord I wish I knew what I
don’t know if this is something I need to
figure out on my own Or if I should be
waiting for some kind of sign from
you If you want me to stay I’1l
stay But I can’t figure it out I
can’t hear you anymore and I don’t know
if it’s because you stopped speaking or
I somehow stopped knowing how to
listen Or maybe the voice I heard all
this time wasn’t ever even yours

She then pauses trying so hard to listen for him Just
trying and trying and trying to no avail

MOMENTS LATER Cathleen again begins to carefully undress
out of her habit preparing to change into her nightgown
All in the same meticulous and ritualistic fashion we’ve
seen before

Reaching down for her nightgown however suddenly the
small CROSS that has hung on her wall all this time
falls onto the floor Almost like magic or perhaps this
is the sign she asked for

Cathleen just looks at the cross with a vacant
expression Before she drops all of her clothes suddenly
standing stark naked

Cathleen walks naked across the room to pick up the
cross lays it on her dresser then walks out of frame

Music drifts in

INT CHAPEL - DAY

We hold tightly on Nora jut as her eyes look all around
clearly anxious and uneasy about something PULLING BACK
we see Nora is also wedged in amidst a SMALL CROWD of
people inside the church

All dressed in Sunday best moving and bumping into each
other trying to find seats As Nora again moves down the
center aisle she notices Reverend Mother somewhere
across the chapel just as Reverend Mother notices her
too They both avoid eye contact

INT CHAPEL ANTE ROOM - SAME TIME
The remaining group of second year novices a mere 5 in
total are all lined up and clothed in their wedding

dresses They wait to have their veils attached

Cathleen makes her way to the head of the line as an
elder sister reaches up to attach her veil too

INT CHAPEL - DAY

Music fills in even louder as the ceremony has finally
begun

With the doors to the chapel opening all the novices
make their way toward the altar all in perfect single
file keeping such exquisite custody of the eyes just as
weve seen them before Nora turns to look at Cathleen a
somewhat sad yet resigned expression in her eyes

The procession then all kneel together before the altar
softly bathed in a radiant sort of light that outlines
their bodies like a halo

For the very first time with his faced turned and looking
directly at the congregation the Priest then begins

PRIEST
Guardian of virgins and father Saint
Joseph to whose faithful custody
Innocence itself Christ Jesus and Mary
Virgin of virgins was committed

We hear someone whisper in the audience

CONGREGATION (0S)
Is he speaking English

Before we turn to Reverend Mother sitting near the
front staring at the altar as if the very sight of the
Priest facing her is like a stab in the heart

PRIEST
I pray and beseech thee by each of these
dear pledges Jesus and Mary that being
preserved from all uncleanness I may
with spotless mind pure heart and a
chaste body ever serve Jesus and Mary
most chastely all the days of my life
Amen

Eventually we discover Cathleen knelt down amongst her
sisters eyes hidden from beneath her veil

PRIEST (CONTD)
Let us begin the ceremony

The entire room falls silently as the first in line
Sister Evelyn then moves to genuflect down and kneel
before the Priest He reaches down to her veil

PRIEST (CONTD)
Sister Evelyn what is your desire

Looking into the pews we also see EVELYN’S PARENTS
anxiously craning to see their daughter on the altar And
from the expression they hold even we can feel the
intense pressure on this child

Evelyn waits a long beat then

SISTER EVELYN
With the help of God I’ve come to know
in this community both the difficulty and
joy of a life completely devoted to him
My desire is to make permanent profession
within this community and to wear the
holy habit of the Clare

PRIEST
And what is it you seek

SISTER EVELYN
(shaky)
I seek to take the vows of chastity
poverty and obedience To give my life to
God for all eternity to be married
forever to our Lord Jesus Christ

The Priest makes the sign of the cross over her forehead

PRIEST
Bride of Christ you are now professed

But Sister Evelyn remains completely frozen She looks so
terrified Before she finally returns to her place
Once Evelyn is gone the Priest motions to Cathleen and
she too moves forward taking Evelyn’s place

The Priest lifts Cathleen’s veil stares into her eyes

PRIEST (CONTD)
Sister what is your desire

Beat Cathleen then pauses for a very long time before
speaking She wears an almost unreadable expression

SISTER CATHLEEN
With the help of God I’ve come to know
in this community both the difficulty and
joy of a life completely devoted to him
My desire is to make permanent profession
in this community and to wear the holy
habit of the Rose

Nora shakes her head defeated Reverend Mother just
lowers her eyes and begins to pray

PRIEST
And what do you seek

Cathleen again pauses Staring at the ground so lost in
thought consumed in emotion trying to figure it all
out She looks up again trying to answer the question

SISTER CATHLEEN

What do I seek What do I seek I
seek

She then suddenly stops just staring straight at the
ground paralyzed the entire room left in silence

Long Beat Enduring silence

SISTER CATHLEEN (CONT’D)
What do I seek What do I seek

Long Beat Enduring silence The Priest stares at her so
confused

SISTER CATHLEEN (CONT’D)
I seek I seek

Everybody continues to just wait the whole room held on
a pin

Cathleen then finally looks up again staring at the
Priest as he stares right back at her

Before a strange new aura a new sense of self of
conviction of peace and understanding gradually awakens
in her eyes Cathleen smiles she understands it now

HARD TO BLACK

A long silence is held in the vacuum before we hear
Cathleen’s final whisper

SISTER CATHLEEN (0S)
(CONT’D)
I seek something more

The faithful BELL then chimes once more At the same time
as one last series of TEXT appears on the screen

In the years that followed Vatican II
the Church witnessed a mass exodus of
nuns on a scale it have never seen
before

90000 nuns renounced their vocations and
left their convents

THE END
