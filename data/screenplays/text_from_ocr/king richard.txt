RICHARD WILLIAMS A tall powerfully-built black
man with broken teeth a graying beard and a lifetime of
rejection and resentment

Richard stands in the pro shop in his TENNIS ATTIRE when
a TENNIS PRO arrives with a SHOPPING BAG

TENNIS PRO
Grounds crew threw out most of
‘em Got a few here but they look
pretty dead

RICHARD
They not dead to us

Richard looks in the bag It’s filled with RATTY OLD
TENNIS BALLS Richard takes it thankfully and without
shame heading out with his bounty as we hear --

RICHARD (VO)
Where I grew up in Louisiana
Seedy Grove Tennis was not a
game peoples played We was too
busy running from the Klan But
here it is

EXT PALOS VERDES COUNTRY CLUB - VARIOUS SHOTS - MORNING

Richard’s garbled Louisiana drawl continues as he strolls
the manicured grounds collecting stray balls as he goes
He plucks them from trash as WHITE CLUB MEMBERS play

RICHARD (VO)
when I’m interested in a thing
I learn it How it works How the
best people in the world do it
That’s what I did with tennis and
the girls

INT RICHARD’S VW BUS - DAY

Richard’s now at the wheel listening to a homemade tape
as he drives to another club through postcard LA

BUD COLLINS (VO)
If you look at the biggest
servers Sampras Lendl
Connors You’ll see the break of
their wrists is like a smack
Like a high-five That’s what
you’re looking for when you hit
it That pop

Richard practices as he drives in his van which is a
character itself

Part mobile tennis clinic part mobile home it’s filled
with schoolbooks cassette tapes audiobooks on parenting
and self-help like RICH DAD POOR DAD along with a
ridiculous accoutrement of tennis shit Drill cones
Broken rackets Milk crates filled with hundreds of
collected USED BALLS Like Richard it’s charming and
one-of-a-kind

RICHARD (VO)
Now all we need is a club

EXT FANCY TENNIS CLUB - DAY

We now understand we’ve been hearing a sales pitch which
Richard is giving to an UNINTERESTED PRO at another fancy
club He hands him a HOMEMADE BROCHURE

RICHARD
For training And Clinics The
whole deal Everything the girls
need to go from prodigy to pro
EXT ANOTHER FANCY TENNIS CLUB - DAY

Richard’s presentation continues to BUD COLLINS the
Bob Hope of tennis listening graciously poolside

RICHARD
I wrote me a 78-page plan for
their whole career before they was
even born

Bud laughs quite amused and --

EXT ANOTHER FANCY TENNIS CLUB - DAY

Richard continues at another FANCY CLUB following a very
DISMISSIVE PRO

RICHARD
It was 1977 and I had watched this
tennis match and I seen them give
this girl - Virginia Ruzici -- 40
thousand dollars for four days
work and since I knew I’d only
made 52000 all year I knew I
was in the wrong business Went
home that night told the wife we
need to make two more kids

OFF the DISMISSIVE PRO just fucking flabbergasted and --
RICHARD (PRE-LAP)
So that night I wrote up the plan
EXT ANOTHER FANCY TENNIS CLUB - DAY
Richard’s now cornered ANOTHER BAFFLED PRO at practice
RICHARD
One for Venus One for Serena
Covered their tennis Educations
Foreign languages Everything
And now that plan says it’s time
for us to come see you so you can

help turn them into champions

He hands the pro the brochure and --

EXT COUNTRY CLUB - POOLSIDE - DAY

Bud flips through it too A HOMEMADE PAMPHLET FULL OF
NUMBERS GRAPHS and CHARTS The girls’ “FUTURE
EARNINGS” Bud reads it in disbelief as --

( )

RICHARD
Now I know what you’re thinking
This family is from the ghetto
How they going to pay old me

EXT ANOTHER FANCY TENNIS CLUB - DAY
Richard’s on the court with the Baffled Pro
RICHARD
Well don’t you worry ‘bout that

We’re not here to rob you We’re
here to make you rich

EXT FANCY TENNIS CLUB - DAY
The Uninterested Pro hands the brochure back to Richard

UNINTERESTED PRO
You ever think about basketball

EXT COUNTRY CLUB - POOLSIDE - DAY
-- and Bud hands it back too

BUD COLLINS
Best of luck to ya

RICHARD
OK You making a mistake but I’m
gonna let you make it Them pants
look expensive

BUD COLLINS
Oh they are

EXT ANOTHER FANCY TENNIS CLUB - DAY

-- and finally the Baffled Pro returns Richards
pamphlet as well with some last words of advice

BAFFLED PRO
If I had a dollar for every crazy
parent who told me their kids’11l
be number one I’d be a rich man

RICHARD
You look pretty rich to me

BAFFLED PRO
Well there you go

( )

The Baffled Pro serves His STUDENT returns it Richard
can’t help but pipe in

RICHARD
You need to open up your stance a
little more Your stance too
closed

Off Richard’s frustration heading off the court back to--

EXT COMPTON CALIFORNIA - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

A different world A diverse working-class neighborhood
made infamous by gangs drug wars and NWA

Richard’s bus drives past the Compton Swap DandK Donuts
Louis Burgers Liquor stores on the corners Cops on the
streets Lowriders booming the latest tracks of the day

And right in the heart of it we meet --

EXT WILLIAMS’ HOME (COMPTON) - DAY

TWO young BLACK GIRLS (8 and 9) lugging PHONE BOOKS from
their front lawn

Both are adorable in braids and glowing smiles The
TALLER one carries THREE BOOKS The LITTLE one not to
be outdone carries FOUR barely seeing over the top

VENUS (TALLER GIRL)
Serena what are you doing Those
books are bigger than you are

SERENA (LITTLE GIRL)
No they’re not I can do it I
can carry more than you

VENUS
And break your back while you’re
at it

SERENA

Wanna bet
The little one takes off running her sister letting her
win as they race around dropping phonebooks into their
neighbors’ yards These are VENUS AND SERENA WILLIAMS

Venus is nine but already tall regal selfless and
preternaturally self-possessed

( )

Serena is eight and a rascal She’s confident
irrepressible and has an insatiable need for attention
More than all else though she idolizes Venus

Winded Serena reaches their neighbors’ house first where
A MIDDLE-AGED BLACK WOMAN greets them in a housecoat
Her name is MS STRICKLAND

MS STRICKLAND

Girls

SERENA
Told you I’d win Hi Ms
Strickland

Serena hands her a phone book

MS STRICKLAND
Thank you Now you need to go
tell your father to stop working
you so hard Seen y’all practicing
in the rain That man is crazy

On cue Richard steps out of his bus parked behind them

RICHARD
Hey girls Go head back in the
house Tell your sisters we
leavin’ in a few minutes We’1l
deliver the rest of them books
later

The girls do as instructed as Richard crosses to Ms
Strickland’s fence

RICHARD
Not gon’ tell you again Do not
talk to them kids

MS STRICKLAND
Excuse me they came on to my
lawn And somebody’s gotta as
hard as you working ‘em

RICHARD

They work as hard as they need to
to stay off these streets I’m in
the champion-raisin’ business

Got a book about it bout to come
out soon Maybe I give a copy to
your daughter Remind me which
corner she working on again

MS STRICKLAND
Get off my property

( )

ORACENE
Richard leave that nosey woman
alone

He turns to see his wife ORACENE “BRANDI” WILLIAMS A tall funny private hardworking woman in SCRUBS in
the driveway of their SMALL GREEN STUCCO HOUSE

Richard starts walking over to her still calling back

RICHARD MS STRICKLAND
Stop talking to my kids Got those booty hugging
shorts You need some
bigger shorts

Richard returns to his house giving Oracene a kiss

ORACENE
You know she just trying to rile
you up I gotta get to work

RICHARD
Think you riling me up with them
little nurse shoes on You know I
love these little nurse shoes

ORACENE
(laughs)
Get these girls off to practice
The laundry’s all done and I
talked to Tunde’s teachers about
those AP classes she wanted

RICHARD
All right Have a good day

They kiss again and Richard heads to his van now filled
with his 5 DAUGHTERS Venus Serena YETUNDE (Tunde)
16 and a scholar ISHA 13 and an athlete And LYNN
12 and a princess Oracene waves goodbye from her car

ORACENE
Keep turning those hips if you
want to get power

Before she can go Serena runs out of the van to give her
one more hug They are close Richard calls out --

RICHARD
Come on now Slow walker’s a slow
thinker
INT EXT RICHARD’S VW BUS (MOVING) - MOMENTS LATER

Richard’s at the wheel Five girls piled in back doing
homework and joking Tunde’s deep in a schoolbook

LYNN
Tunde dang you’re a nerd Why
you doing homework on a Saturday

TUNDE
‘Cause I wanna get an A You
should try it with your B-PLUS

Her other sisters laugh continuing to pile on Lynn as --

VENUS
Where we practicing today Daddy

SERENA
Yeah Where we practicing

RICHARD
At the club And Serena stop
saying everything Venus say

LYNN
Hope they don’t steal our balls
again

ISHA

Lynn you probably told them to do
it so we wouldn’t have to
practice

The sisters laugh

RICHARD
We got us a van full of balls
And you don’t need to be worrying
about what other folks is doing
anyway You need to worry about
what you doing We out here
getting great That’s what we need
to be worried about You
understand that

ALL THE SISTERS
Yes Daddy We do

RICHARD
All right

Then Richard lays on the HORN as they drive past a
cemetery A ritual of Richard’s

( )

RICHARD
Say hi to the peoples that’s gone

ALL THE GIRLS
Hi to the peoples that’s gone

The girls all wave as they pass by the tombs before they
finally arrive at --

EXT EAST COMPTON PARK - DAY (VARIOUS SHOTS)

A small municipal park which Richard lovingly ironically
has dubbed EAST COMPTON HILLS COUNTRY CLUB

Basketball courts Concrete playgrounds (which the LOCAL
GANGS use as their personal drug bazaar)

RICHARD
Who’s ready to work

In clown-car fashion the whole Williams gang unloads
tennis gear from the bus TWO OVERSIZED TENNIS BAGS for
Venus and Serena each bigger than them as they approach

TWO of the worst-kept TENNIS COURTS you’ll ever see
Nets sagging Surface pockmarked with gunfire littered
with dime bags and liquor bottles

Impervious to it all Venus and Serena begin their
unorthodox business of warming up

Richard carries his milk crates of balls and dumps them
inside a locked SHOPPING CART already full of used balls

Richard uses this cart as his ball basket to feed

We can see Richard guards his cart with a makeshift
padlock almost as old and rusty as he is Charming

The three older girls help Richard unload and set up
CONES for his drills as Venus and Serena jog laps

RICHARD
Stay up on your toes you make too
much noise

They keep at it while Richard methodically cleans the
courts sweeping up the Baggies and bottles with a BROOM
chatting up PARK WORKERS and VAGRANTS like the mayor of
Compton An apostle to the world’s WEIRDOS and OUTCASTS

A 45-year-old BLACK MAN walks by calling out

( )

OLD PATRON (BLACK MAN)
King Richard Don’t get much rest
ever do ya

RICHARD
Don’t nothin’ come to a sleeper
but a dream

When the cleaning is done Richard pushes the girls in
the shopping cart full of balls as they laugh and --

Venus and Serena throw FOOTBALLS and toss BROKEN RACKETS
from the baseline as far as they can in a peculiar drill
Richard’s concocted It looks unusual and --

Richard continues prepping hanging up HOMEMADE SIGNS

“If you fail to plan you plan to fail”
“You are a winner”
“Be humble -- Say Thank you”

Finally they are ready to practice Richard calls out
placing four balls into a pyramid

RICHARD
First drill Whoever hit that --
one dollar

They hit ball after ball at the target as Isha Tunde
and (a very bored) Lynn shag balls at the fence

RICHARD
Yes Yes that’s good power
Serena Williams There you go
Great power Venus Williams
Speed that racket head up There
you go

They are out here for hours all working their asses off
but whatever they do Richard instills them with
confidence and fun and we see it

There’s something intangible here Even at 8 and 9 the
girls’ athleticism tenacity and drive are
stratospheric When Venus just misses the target --

RICHARD
OH Almost Venus Williams
Almost Venus Williams Very good

Venus steps up again an incredibly diligent student and -
BOOM -- she nails it exactly

( )
ll

RICHARD
There you go There you go
Yes you keep that stance open or
I’m gon’ come down there and
tickle you

Their practice continues for hours with Richard’s nonstop
encouragement

RICHARD
Get to it Get to it Yes very
good Don’t wait for that ball
Go get it Good depth there
Good depth Don’t get too
excited This is your game Make
sure you controlling that ball on
every shot

Richard watches as they rally while Tunde sits on a milk
crate doing homework by the fence Behind her a GROUP
OF YOUNG MEN play basketball on the court and --

SAME SCENE - A SHORT WHILE LATER
Richard stands at the fence as the girls serve

RICHARD
Get all the way up to that cotton-
picker All the way up to that
cotton picker There you go
Yes yes Yes Venus Williams

Venus thunders a final empathic serve to end the day

RICHARD
Come on in here
(once they join him)
That’s a very very good day
today You did good work

(then)
Venus Williams who is your best
friend
VENUS
You Daddy
RICHARD
Serena Williams who is your best
friend
SERENA

Venus then you

( )

RICHARD
laughs)
Unbelievable That’s unbelievable
Give your Daddy a kiss

The girls plant two on his cheek as Richard now spots

Tunde at a distance head in a book doing her best to
ignore a tall good-looking 18-year-old boy who calls
himself ROC chatting her up through the fence

RICHARD
to Venus and Serena)
Go and get all the balls up --

The girls hop to it as Richard watches Roc chat up Tunde

ROC
How you doing I’m sorry What’s
your name
(off her silence)
You don’t gotta act like that yo
We just trying to talk to you

Richard calls out from afar
RICHARD
Tunde Pick your things up get
your sisters go ahead to the bus
ROC
Tunde that’s your name Hey the
homie said he wanna talk to you
Tunde you ain’t gotta be acting
like that love
Tunde tries to ignore him as she heads off the court
ROC
Don’t drop your backpack baby
Hold on to your shit

Richard wraps out but his dander is up eyes focused on
Roc laughing with his boy in the park and --
EXT EAST COMPTON PARK - TENNIS COURTS - LATE AFTERNOON

Practice complete the girls are already in the van as
Richard exits the court hearing --

Roc still hollering at Tunde from the park

( )

ROC
Yo Tunde The homie’s still
right here

Richard’s seen enough He heads over to the men

RICHARD
Young man I asked you a couple
times That girl there is only 16
years old She’s out here to
work Just leave her alone

ROC
I’11 talk to whoever I want homie

RICHARD
Just leave these girls at peace

With that Richard walks off Roc follows but a boy TD
steps in

TD
Yo Roc come on Leave his old
ass alone

ROC
(still at Richard)
Yo what up You feel like you
better than us or something homie
Hey homeboy I know you hear me
talking to you

He catches up with Richard who turns to face him

ROC

What’s up homie You got something

you wanna say
RICHARD

I done said what I wanna say

Just mind your business She not

interested in you

Richard starts to move toward the bus when --

CRACK Roc sucker-punches him hard in his stomach A
vicious body-blow that takes out his wind and then --

BOOM Roc hits him hard in the face dropping Richard
again

Hunched on all fours and gasping Richard watches as Roc
retreats laughing and mocking him to his friends --

( )

ROC (0S)
See your Daddy now Tunde Keep
your old ass at home

Richard musters the strength to get back to his feet

Beaten but not broken Richard gathers his pride licks
his wounds and he heads off to the bus

INT EXT RICHARDS VW VAN - DUSK

Richard drives home face already swelling Everybody is
quiet Tunde checks on him from the backseat

TUNDE
Daddy are you ok

RICHARD
That wasn’t nothing

SERENA
You did really good out there
Daddy but next time you swing
remember to keep your stance open

Despite his pain Richard laughs

RICHARD

That’s funny That was funny
When I was your age I used to
have to fight every day If it
wasnt the Ku Klux Klan or police
or the white boys from the next
town somebody was always beatin’
on me for something And I didn’t
have no daddy to stand in their
way

(beat)
This world ain’t never had no
respect for Richard Williams but
they gonna respect y’all They
gonna respect y’all

The girls listen quite solemn as --

EXT WILLIAMS’ HOME (COMPTON) - NIGHT (LATER)

They finally arrive home 1117 East Stockton Street
Their quaint green stucco one-story house marred by
black graffiti where -- Richard pulls up

They exit the VW to see the lights of a COMPTON PD
CRUISER flashing past the NEIGHBORS all watching

( )

MS STRICKLAND
Somebody oughta call the cops on
you

MS STRICKLAND yells from across the street

VENUS
Daddy what’s happening

RICHARD
Nothing Junior Go ahead in the
house

Richard regroups following his girls inside into --

INT WILLIAMS’ HOME (COMPTON) - NIGHT

-- the tiny well-kept home where the five girls barrel
inside with their book bags and tennis gear giving hugs
to their mom still in her nursing uniform just come
home from work busy finishing dinner Family chaos

ALL THE GIRLS
Hi mom Hey mom

ORACENE
Hey girls Dinner’s ready How

SERENA

LYNN
(sarcastic)

Before Oracene can process that her daughters start
setting up for dinner

TUNDE

If we eat fast enough we probably
have time for the talent show

SERENA
Hold on I’m going first I

LYNN

In unison her sisters all chime in together singing --

ALL THE SISTERS
Because the greatest love of all --

( )

SERENA
What’s so funny It’s a good song

They crack up laughing as Oracene brings out the food

ORACENE
You all go wash up

The girls run off to the bathroom leaving the parents
alone for a moment in the kitchen

ORACENE
What happened

RICHARD
That same boy was sniffin’ ‘round
Tunde

Oracene hands him a bag of FROZEN PEAS from the freezer
Richard takes it grateful Pressing it to his face

RICHARD

Oracene watches concerned as he returns to the girls now
fixing plates at the table

RICHARD
Ok girls Half hour finish your
homework then get to bed

TUNDE
(noticing the bag)
Daddy are those peas
RICHARD
Yeah you like peas Who wants
some peas

The girls laugh as Richard goes Oracene following into --

THEIR VERY SMALL BEDROOM

-- where Oracene arrives in the doorway regarding
Richard still sore from his beating starting to change
out of his tennis clothes for a shower His SECURITY
GUARD UNIFORM hangs on the door

ORACENE
Something has to change

RICHARD

She laughs

ORACENE

The parents laugh listening to Serena singing at the
top of her lungs She’s no Whitney Houston Richard
then grabs the uniform --

RICHARD
I gotta get to work

-- and kisses her on the way to the bathroom passing the
girls signing in their room --

RICHARD
You gon’ shake up this world

INT HOUSE (COMPTON) - GIRLS’ BEDROOM - LATER

Talent show is over The girls in their pajamas are
playing charades in their cramped little bedroom when
Richard -- showered and changed into his SECURITY UNIFORM
-- appears in the door

RICHARD
10 o’clock girls Time for bed

The girls finish their game and file into their beds

RICHARD
You all wrote in your journals
Made your plans for tomorrow

Ok

ALL THE GIRLS
Ok

RICHARD
All right You girls go to bed

ALL THE SISTERS
Goodnight Daddy

Richard shuts the lights off and leaves We STAY a
moment with the girls the two sisters in bed and --

EXT SWAP MEET (COMPTON) - NIGHT

It’s late when Richard’s bus rumbles into a bleak Compton
strip mall and parks outside a local swap meet where --

INT SWAP MEET (COMPTON) - AISLESOFFICE - NIGHT

Richard walks down the aisles as merchants close their
shops for the evening before he finally arrives at --

A cluttered little office Richard unlocks the desk
drawer removing a PISTOL which he holsters on his belt
And then Richard sits down exhausted

For a moment it looks like he might fall asleep but he
fights the urge Instead he turns on a light takes out
his things and gets down to work

Not billing or paperwork for his security job but
tennis MAGAZINES ORDER FORMS Even the HOMEMADE now
legendary 78-PAGE PLAN (we heard about earlier)

( )

Richard combs through his research and opens a copy of
WORLD TENNIS MAGAZINE AN INSTRUCTIONAL ARTICLE A PHOTO

VIC BRADEN -- the legendary portly tennis coach smiling
on the pages The title “THE MAN WHO MADE TENNIS FUN”

Richard studies the pages and writes down Vic’s name as --

RICHARD (PRE-LAP)
-- as you notice Vic uhh --

INT LA COUNTRY CLUB - VIC BRADEN’S OFFICE - DAY

Were close on a SMALL TV playing a HOMEMADE VIDEO Venus
and Serena wearing jeans hit on the ratty court as
Richard narrates 0OS

RICHARD (0S)
-- hopefully they have very good
form And uhhh and you can see
that the serve looks very good
hopefully

Abruptly the video cuts to find Venus wearing a long fur
coat in the middle of spring

RICHARD (0S)
Raise you hand Serena

Serena waves

RICHARD (0S)
Venus Williams

Venus waves The tape FREEZES over a moment

RICHARD (0S)
Uhh we have your tape ‘Tennis
Our Way’ and we’ve been viewin’
it However the tape says you’ll
be good by Friday Guess what
Vic we got good by Tuesday
That’s how good your tape is

Pull out to reveal we’re watching this in --
VIC BRADEN’S OFFICE
Behind his desk VIC BRADEN (60s) watches dumbfounded

in awe completely speechless as Richard standing in his
office before him mouths along with the tape

( )

RICHARD (ON THE VIDEO)
These girls is looking for some
coaching and we think you’d be
great so you want to relax take
it easy and get a chance to see
some real good tennis players

RICHARD
Ok That’s it

The video ends Vic takes a beat to digest what he saw

VIC
I guess you made this yourself

RICHARD
Yes I did yes When the girls
were young I had bought me a
camcorder And I would film
myself in the mirror asking
questions and doing things like
that And then when they got
older I did it with them I call
that their media training

VIC
Oh I see That’s very
industrious

RICHARD

Well I’m a businessman Vic
Vic nods looking for the softest way to explain this --

VIC
This deal that you’re asking for
all this for free Richard no
one’s taking that bet Tennis is a
technical sport Probably the
most and if you haven’t grown up
around the game then --
(taking Richard in)
It’s like the violin It takes
hours and hours a day year after
year of expensive expert
instruction just to hold the thing
right And even then even for a
family with unlimited financial
resources the chances of
achieving the kind of mastery and
success you’re talking about --
with one kid let alone two --
well that’s like asking someone
to believe you got the next two
Mozarts in your house
(MORE )
( )

VIC (CONTD)
It’s just very very unlikely
I’m sorry That’s just my two
cents Maybe you’1ll prove me
wrong

Vic offers his hand Richard takes it just gutted and --

EXT EAST COMPTON PARK - TENNIS COURTS - LATE AFTERNOON

With nowhere else to turn they are back on the courts
Venus and Serena hitting in the glow of the streetlights
as Richard looks on for once saying nothing looking
very wrung out We PUSH IN ON him simmering as we hear -

RICHARD (PRE-LAP)
Dear Heavenly Father Jehovah
God We thank you for this food

EXTINT FAST FOOD RESTAURANT - MAGIC HOUR

As seen THROUGH the window the entire Williams clan
five girls two parents sit at a booth praying before
their meal

RICHARD
We ask you to bless the hands of
the people who prepared this food
Thank you for this opportunity as
a family to come together And we
ask you to please please don’t
let nobody get fat from eating all
this food In Jesus name we pray
Amen

THE WHOLE FAMILY
Amen

And they dig in chatting animatedly as they go except
for Richard His thoughts far away Oracene clocks him

ORACENE
Youre not eating

RICHARD
Actually I got some - uh - got
some work I got to do so -- you

all ride home with your mother

ORACENE
Everything ok You all right

( )

RICHARD
Everything great Yeah it’s
fine Y’all bring my food home
when you come

Richard gets up from the table and heads for the door

ALL THE GIRLS
Goodbye daddy

RICHARD
Goodbye

Richard goes The girls joking about who’s going to eat
his food while Oracene watches him concerned and --

EXT EAST COMPTON PARK - TENNIS COURTS - NIGHT

Standing alone on the dark empty courts Richard swats
balls with a racket taking stock of his life His
dreams utterly unreachable and at that very moment --

ROC
Hey where’s Tunde at homes

Richard’s aware of Roc TD and TWO OTHER GANG MEMBERS
getting out of their LOWRIDER and approaching the courts

ROC
Did I stutter nigga

Richard hopes to avoid this So does TD Roc’s friend

TD
Roc yo Let’s roll That chump
Chauncey’s at Swap We bounce
now we can smoke him Leave this
old dude alone

But Roc doesn’t budge Steps into Richard’s space

ROC
Know what my daddy taught me How
to smoke a blunt and how to smoke
a bitch nigga too I’m real good
at both

Then Roc pumps like he’s gonna hit Richard who naturally
flinches He tries to walk away

ROC
Scared homie huh Tell Tunde me
and the homies might come by later
and run on a train on her

( )

BAM -- that’s the last straw Richard hits him with the
racket and Roc goes down as Richard wails him again
CRACK CRACK CRACK A few more shots before --

TD jumps in throwing Richard to the ground and -- WHAM
The guys all surround him stomping the absolute shit out
of him until --

ROC
Get the fuck out the way

The flurry of kicks stops and Richard peers up from the
ground to see --

Roc looming above him a GUN in his hand He puts it to
Richard’s temple

GANG MEMBER 3

Smoke that fool dawg Smoke him

homie He came to disrespect you

in our hood

Roc stills the gun The muzzle right above Richard and --

ROC

Don’t nobody give a damn about

you homeboy Nobody

And then Roc pulls the gun away The misery seemingly
over until --

BOOM Roc rears back and hits Richard with the gun
LIGHTS OUT Richard’s unconscious on the ground as --

Roc and his boys trash his shit Smash his cart
scattering his ball on the court that roll by Richards
motionless body like waves on the shore as we --

FADE OUT

FADE IN ON

INT EXT RICHARDS VW BUS (MOVING) - NIGHT

Back at the wheel Richard cruises through Compton
busted up and bleeding searching for the gang as we see -

THE GUN (from his office drawer) on the passenger’s seat

RICHARD

Venus backhand We’ll hit some
down the line alright

( )

RICHARD
That’s good Paul that’s how I
usually start with them too
That’s real smart

PAUL
(unbelievable)
Good Alright ready

Paul begins a standard drill Both girls on the baseline
Serena on the deuce court Venus on the ad hitting
backhands

Paul feeds from a basket as we’ve seen Richard do
Forehand Serena Backhand to Venus Again and again
They both hit the ball well but Paul betrays no
reaction Simply picks up the intensity and pace

He feeds them further out wide forcing them into the
alleys Serena hustles all out chasing down every ball

PAUL

All right Really nice Great
job

(then to Serena)
Why don’t you go grab some water
I wanna hit with your sister
Venus you wanna try something a
little different Start in the
middle okay

Serena steps off (reluctantly) as Venus steps to the T

PAUL
I want you to get every ball I’m
not gonna say where it’s going
But don’t stop until we’re done

Paul now begins to feed a much more intense drill moving
Venus side-to-side from forehand to backhand He hits a
drop shot then a lob moving her all over the court and -

Venus just runs her ass off ripping some great shots but
missing some others She’s balletic and ferocious and
her intensity’s clear but --

It’s still not clear what Paul thinks Richard doesn’t
know either watching nervously when --

The drill finally comes to an end as Paul feeds a ball
into the alley which Venus flies to retrieve sliding
into a split that leaves all the men wincing

Her shot bounces long but the effort’s incredible The
hopper finally empty Venus bends over exhausted

( )

Everyone stands there in silence Richard Serena
Even Sampras and Mac until Paul finally speaks --

PAUL
Girls come here and talk to me a
second

RICHARD

Hustle Hustle
The girls jog to the net no idea of his reaction

PAUL
Let me ask you both something
What do you want out of this I
know what he wants but what about
you

The girls look at each other It’s Venus who speaks up

VENUS

Many times as anyone’s won it

PAUL

You think you can do it
VENUS

PAUL

And what about you Who on the
tour do you want to play like

SERENA

The girls run off to collect the balls as Mac and Pete

start to return to the court

PAUL
You taught ‘em all this

RICHARD

Paul considers A mask Leaving Richard just hanging

PAUL
What are you doing Richard What
are you doing

RICHARD
Talkin’ to my daughter something

Again -- Venus’ heads on a swivel

PAUL
No Nothing wrong with that but
you want me to fix her stance and
I can’t do that if you keep
telling her to hit open

something that’s not broke You
been hollerin’ at the girl all day

stance How she supposed to get

PEOPLE have come out to watch --

TOWERING BLONDE (Jamie) who looks like she’s 17 The
best player she’s faced

Jamie hits the corners well running Venus back and forth
until Jamie drills a backhand down the line which --

Venus stretches to reach hitting a short cross-court
forehand that makes Jamie’s mouth water

Three feet inside the line Jamie steps into it tee-ing
up a rocket and rips a cleanly struck forehand that
should be a down the liner winner only --

The ball clips the tape -- pops up in the air -- and
drops the ground on Venus’ side of the net A fortunate
fluke that still should be Jamie’s point but --

Venus is an athletic marvel who has trained for this
moment and -- already sprinting across the baseline
towards the ball’s intended path --

Venus jams on the breaks stops on a dime and flies to
the net getting her strings under the dying ball just an
inch off the ground and --

-- carves a wicked cross-court slice backhand just out of
Jamies sprinting reach It’s a masterful play

The CROWD can’t believe it Jamie can’t either but
unlike other girl’s Venus has vanquished Jamie does not
explode or complain She raises her racket to Venus
tapping it with her hand in a gesture of praise

Richard is surprised by her composure and grace and --

As Venus and Jamie shake hands at the net accepting
their FIRST (Venus) and SECOND PLACE TROPHIES --

Richard takes a photo of the whole family with Jamie
both girls holding their trophies

VENUS
Nice meeting you

RICHARD
You did real good You should be
very proud of yourself
Richard watches his family celebrate excitedly while
Jamie head held high walks off stoically with her
parents and her runner-up trophy

A moment of quiet dignity that effects Richard deeply

END MONTAGE

INT RICHARD’S VW BUS - DAY

Richard drives home still uneasy His family is piled
in the back passing around the trophy giddy for Venus

SERENA

The girls laugh and cheer for Venus from the back seat
Oracene smiles on Richard does not

SERENA

ISHA

looked like she was 18 and Venus
still whooped her anyway
Most of the family laughs but Richard’s reaching a boil

( )

RICHARD

stop all that bragging

Oracene cuts him a look

LYNN

proof

RICHARD

Alright now I done said what I’m

RICHARD
I’m listening to them I know what
bragging sounds like

ORACENE
She’s just happy

RICHARD
Junior won That girl lost
Everyone did their best I don’t
wanna hear no more about it

ISHA
(can’t help herself)
If that was that girl’s best she
needs to practice some more

That gets a few laughs but not one from Richard who
spots a BODEGA ahead pulls into the lot Steaming

INT EXT RICHARDS VW BUSBODEGA - PARKING LOT -
CONTINUOUS ACTION

RICHARD
All right big shots Here’s five
bucks Go practice getting me

( )

The girls take the money step out of the van and run

off toward

the store unaware that --

As soon as they’re out of the car Richard throws the van
back in gear and drives off down the street

ORACENE
Richard Where are you going

RICHARD
They wanna brag let ‘em brag how

The girls finally return catching up with the car

( )

VENUS

RICHARD

The girls pile in eyes rolling afraid of what’s coming

INT WILLIAMS’ HOME (COMPTON) - AFTERNOON

A few minutes later the girls are sitting glumly on the
couch as Richard stands by the TV

RICHARD

ORACENE

RICHARD

ORACENE

And she gets up and walks out leaving Richard alone as --

THE SOUND OF POURING RAIN BEGINS THUNDERING OVER --

EXT EAST COMPTON PARK - TENNIS COURTS - NIGHT

Where Venus and Serena practice with Richard in the rain
They’re soaked The court’s slippery but just like
Richard’s hoped they’re having a blast It looks fun

RICHARD

heavy so you can’t let them hit
the ground cause they not gon’

Richard feeds them and the half-volley in the rain

RICHARD

Venus and Serena laugh playing into the night and --

EXT EAST COMPTON PARK - A SHORT WHILE LATER

Practice is done So is the rain Richard leads his
daughters back toward the van All sopping wet

RICHARD
Well at least don’t nobody have
to take no bath tonight

Just then TD and two other gangsters pull up the van in
their black lowrider Everyone freezes Richard places
himself in between the men and his daughters readying
for a fight but TD looks at Venus --

TD

trophies home to Compton

Off Richard and the girls surprise --

EXT WILLIAMS’ HOME (COMPTON) - NIGHT

OFF the officers realizing they got a bad lead --

EXT WILLIAMS’ HOME (COMPTON) - NIGHT

A short time later Richard and Oracene are united on
their porch watching the Sheriffs pull away revealing Ms
Strickland watching from her lawn then disappearing
inside Oracene’s already heading that way

RICHARD

EXT CALIFORNIA U - JUNIOR OPEN - COURT 2 - MOMENTS

Richard hurries through the grounds to another COURT
where a small crowd has begun to gather

( )

He can’t see it yet but the POP coming off the balls
doesn’t sound normal Not at this age It’s FEROCIOUS
He arrives as the crowd APPLAUDS to see

Serena playing a match Richards first instinct at
being disobeyed is to physically pull her off the court
but Oracene arriving there too stops him

ORACENE
May as well let her finish

Richards slowed for a moment as -- he watches Serena
race around the court finally let off the leash

She’s in a cross-court rally Four cross-court backhands
until BANG Serena rips the fifth up the line Winner

SERENA
Cmon

Serena smiles There’s magic even Richard can’t deny but -

When Serena spots her father in the crowd -- the music
stops The magic over Believing she’s in trouble
Serena starts off the court when --

INT WILLIAMS’ HOUSE (COMPTON) - EVENING

Several weeks later Venus is at the table with a copy
of The New York Times reading from the article aloud
The headline reads

“TENNIS STATUS UNDEFEATED FUTURE ROSY AGE 10”

VENUS

(reading)
‘At a time when tennis prodigies
seem to be surfacing every week

Californian Venus Williams

(as everyone cheers)
Last weekend Williams captured
her 17th singles title in less
than a year by winning the age-12-
or-under Southern California

ISHA

Dang Venus You’re famous
SERENA
(reading in a huff)
This doesn’t even mention me once

Serena scowls in disbelief as we look over to Oracene and
Richard distracted by a NEWS STORY ON TV

( )

NEWS REPORTER (VO)
the investigation into Police
brutality in Los Angeles CNN’s
Robert Vito has the story but
first this word of caution Some
of you might be disturbed by the
violent nature of the pictures
contained in this piece

The footage is of course THE BEATING OF RODNEY KING

NEWS REPORTER (VO)
It appears to be a group of Los
Angeles police officers beating
the suspect with nightsticks and
kicking him as other officers look
on George Holiday who works for a
drain company and taped this

The parents watch this disturbed when the PHONE RINGS

SERENA

She stomps off to the KITCHEN Oracene turns to Richard

ORACENE

ON THE TENNIS COURT NANCY REAGAN is surrounded by a
group of INNER-CITY KIDS who have been bused in for the
event -- well really for the photo-op Venus and Serena
among them

NANCY REAGAN
I was at a clinic in Oakland when
a young girl asked me But what

thinking I said Just say no

The crowd claps PHOTOGRAPHERS snaps pictures And we --

LAND ON RICHARD watching the exploitation incredulously
from the TRELLIS in a crowd of very self-satisfied BLUE
BLOODS He’s at the ball but he’s the entertainment

Paul stands at his side with a different perspective

PAUL
It’s pretty remarkable Richard
Your girls are standing with the
First Lady of the United States
You did that

Off Richard quite skeptical and --

EXT RIVIERA COUNTRY CLUB - DAY (LATER)

Richard sits under the trellis trying to watch Venus and
Serena play an exhibition against TWO NOTABLE PROS when -

Paul arrives with TWO SMARMY SUITED HUCKSTERS

PAUL
There’s the man Richard this is
George MacArthur and Laird
Stabler

RICHARD
George Laird

LAIRD a blue-blood agent sticks out his hand Richard
shakes clocking GEORGE a sixty-year-old man who looks
and dresses like a Kennedy

LAIRD
George is the head of the agency
right there

RICHARD
We got the big boss I can tell by
the cigar

( )

LAIRD
Heck of a girl you got there
Just incredible Love to help you
take her to the next level

A waitress approaches as they all sit

WAITRESS
Can I get you anything

GEORGE
Usual

GEORGE

Thanks for coming Richard What
do you think of the club

RICHARD
Yeah it’s real great We
appreciate everyone taking off
their hoods before we came in
(enjoys watching them
freeze then)
I’m kidding We’ve been here a
couple times

They exchange a look -- this guys is nuts Nevertheless --

LAIRD
Well Richard first of all we
just wanna congratulate you on the
great job you’ve done so far I
mean honestly it’s incredible

RICHARD
It’s incredible

AT THE COURT CROWDS APPLAUD as the MATCH wraps up

GEORGE
I’m sure you know but Laird
here is the best He discovered
Capriati when she was 10 Mary
Pierce too And we believe Venus
can be bigger than both

RICHARD
I’m sorry You said two times
already that it’s incredible Why
is what we did so incredible

Laird is confused

( )

LATRD
I just mean with your resources
and experiences --

Paul jumps in trying to salvage this

PAUL
Richard I think he’s just saying
that you’ve done an incredible job
with the girls --

RICHARD
Hold on Hold on Paul That is a
full grown adult man He don’t
need you to say what he said If
you were going to say what he
said you coulda said it back at
the house We coulda saved
everybody the trouble of coming to
this meeting Now I done asked
this man a simplified question He
overemphasizing how incredible it
is what we did I see all these
white kids around here and he
ain’t saying how incredible that
is Let him answer the question

PAUL
Ok that’s why we’re here We’re
here to ask questions

RICHARD
Why is it so incredible what we
did

LAIRD
I’m sorry -- I certainly did not

mean any offense Mr Williams
I’m very sorry I just meant with
your background --

RICHARD

My background Of course what you
mean is our race

(Laird is silent)
That’s ok We get it Little black
girl in an all-white sport that’s
why we picked tennis Little
ghetto Cinderella Ghetto-rella

This is going sideways fast George steps in to save it

GEORGE
Well Richard that’s exactly what
were talking about
(MORE )
( )

GEORGE (CONTD)
We think Venus could be
inspirational to a whole group of
people who frankly as an
industry we have not done enough
to reach Venus could open a lot
of doors and we’d like to help her
do it

RICHARD
(baiting them)
So what are you offering

LATRD
Whatever you need Shoes
Coaches Rackets --

RICHARD
Rackets They offering rackets We
wouldn’t even be sitting here if
you hadn’t seen what they’d done
with their rackets

LAIRD
Yes Fair enough

RICHARD
C’mon You sure you’re the best

LAIRD
I don’t know he said it
GEORGE
Richard can I be frank
RICHARD
You can be whoever the hell you
want
GEORGE

What Venus needs now is more court
time The right training and
tournaments and exposure That’s a
hundred grand a year easy but
that’s what our agency does You
sign with us and we’ll help you
carry that burden Let us take it
from here Let us make this a sure
thing You don’t want to risk all
that do you Richard

Beat Richard farts Everyone’s frozen
RICHARD
I think I’m gonna go get in the
pool We’ll talk later

( )

And Richard gets up and exits leaving Paul on his own

LATRD
Lovely to meet you

GEORGE
What the hell was that

EXT RIVIERA COUNTRY CLUB - POOLSIDE - DAY

Still quite hot Richard searches the club for his girls
Finally he spots them

BY THE POOL where we see a decadent spread of hamburgers
and French fries

Wrapped in a t-shirt and towel Venus and Serena eat with
a few WASPY GIRLS from the club They’re having the time
of their lives

Richard arrives with a head full of steam

RICHARD
What you all doing

VENUS

SERENA

RICHARD
Where’s the food I packed for you

SERENA
Don’t worry It’s all on our tab

RICHARD

All the food here’s for free

RICHARD

time Get up lLet’s go

Embarrassed the girls comply leaving their friends and
following their father who’s caused quite a scene and --

( )

They follow Richard through the event toward the exit
hurrying to keep up confused by what’s happening as
Richard keeps steaming --

SERENA
Daddy what’s wrong

RICHARD
- Sittin’ at the country club
with your legs crossed eatin’ a
burger on a tab like you’re Queen
of Sheba Never take anything

EXT WILLIAMS’ HOUSE (COMPTON) - LATE AFTERNOON (SAME
DAY)

The girls are playing tag in the backyard Serena’s
wearing Richard’s RED UNDERWEAR pulled up over her pants
chasing after her sisters --

VENUS

They run off screaming through the yard passing Richard
and Oracene who greet a very frustrated Paul

PAUL

The hell was that back there

RICHARD

PAUL
Not doing any of what

RICHARD
We not signing with these agents
We not playing no juniors We
ain’t going to do none of it

This is a bomb And it’s news to Oracene too but she
hides her surprise and her anger for now

PAUL
Have you lost your mind Venus is
63-0 you pull her out of Juniors
now you’re going to ruin her
Those girls need to play matches
or they’re going to die on the
vine

( )

RICHARD
Look I’ve heard all the risks
but the Junior circuit’s worse
than the ghetto Kids cracking up
Burning out Their parents oughta
be shot

PAUL
What are you talking about Your
daughters are fine

RICHARD
Yes they fine now but we sign
with these agents you heard ‘em --
they gon’ to race them up the
ladder Nationals Internationals
-- they don’t need all that
pressure They’ll play matches
when they’re pro but right now
they need to be kids

PAUL

There won’t be any pros And even
if there were you don’t sign with
an agent how are you going to
afford all their training till
then

RICHARD
Let me worry about that

PAUL
(to Oracene)
Did you know about this

Oracene holds her tongue and from a distance we can see
like Oracene hears the news for the first
time She’s not pleased

Venus who

PAUL
Richard don’t do this Every
American player who’s ever done
anything got good following this
path Mac Traci Agassi Pete
This window you’ve got is so small

RICHARD

(MORE )

( )

RICHARD (CONTD)
So I’m thinking we just gonna
pause right here and then when the
time is right we just gonna walk
right through the front door

Paul laughs Can’t really argue with that but --

PAUL
I don’t understand You have no
frickin’ clue You are pissed off
because some guy insulted you
today so now you wanna walk away
You are the most stubborn person I
ever met in my life And I coach
McEnroe

RICHARD
We appreciate everything Paul
but this part of our relationship
is done And we will no longer
require your services any more

Venus listening nearby can’t believe what she hears

PAUL
Richard -- no good coach’11l take
them for free if they’re not
playing juniors

RICHARD
You did remember And I think
you a pretty good coach

Paul laughs resigned Nothing to do now but leave

PAUL
I just pray you don’t screw this
up

RICHARD

We appreciate your prayers Paul

That’s it The end of an era Paul exits saying
goodbye to Venus on the way out

PAUL
See you at Wimbledon kid

He gives her a high five leaving Venus with her sisters
considerably shaken as --

We stay on Richard and Oracene who is understandably
upset Aware of Venus’s pain To Richard --

( )

ORACENE
Are we a team

RICHARD
Are we a team We’re a family

ORACENE
So we’re a team And you don’t
think that was a decision you
should have discussed with me
Discussed with Venus

For once Richard has nothing to say

ORACENE
Richard my faith dictates that I
stand by your side but don’t
mistake my silence for agreement
You do that again and I will not
stay quiet Don’t make me look
like a fool

RICHARD
Who made a fool out of you

ORACENE
You You made a fool out of me

And Oracene walks leaving Richard alone as we cut to --

RICHARD

That’s why we’re here Nothing is
impossible for Rick Macci But if
you can’t do it we can go talk to
Nick --

Macci is furious realizing he’s been played Venus
distracted from her match watches the argument wary

MACCI
(livid)
You might have mentioned all this
in Compton

RICHARD
I might have I guess But then
you might not have made the
greatest decision of your life

For Richard the conversation’s over Starts to head off

RICHARD

ball for a serve and we --

MATCH CUT TO

EXT RICK MACCI TENNIS ACADEMY - COURTS 14 AND 15 -
(THREE YEARS LATER)

BOOM A strong 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL smashes the serve out
of the air as we reveal --

It’s Venus pulverizing the ball like a pro In the three
years that have past she’s grown a foot and is now
muscled and lean She has a mouth full of BRACES and new
BRAIDS in her hair

Serena’s here too serving on the next court She’s 13
and strong Sporting BRACES as well They are powerful
athletes not little kids anymore

Macci stands at their side rocking a new 90’s style
while PROS return the girls’ serve

MACCI
Come on Use your legs Get low
You need to explode into the
court Bang

She crushes another serve Another ace

MACCI

There you go Holy smokes Whatd

wanna get in front of that Let’s
go again

(to his assistant)
Hey Barry This time rifle one at
her I wanna Penn 1 tattoo on her
forehead

(to Venus)
That’s one way to get sponsored

Venus laughs then crushes the serve crashing the net
taking a LOW VOLLEY out of the air continuing to close
as the PRO feeds a HIGH HARD VOLLEY right at her head
that Venus with excellent footwork puts away

MACCI
Alright Come here That wasn’t a
good practice Know why

VENUS
Cause it was excellent

( )

MACCI
Exactly

Macci gives her a high-five It turns into a hug In the
time that has passed these two have grown close Macci
then notices --

MACCI
Who’s your old man got booked for
today

Richard (3 YEARS OLDER AS WELL and LOOKING WELL KEPT)
riding outside the courts in his very own GOLF CART with
a suited JEREMY SCHAAP-like reporter while a CAMERAMAN
films them

ON THE BALCONY OUTSIDE THE CLUBHOUSE Macci can see a
CAMERA CREW setting up for a sit down interview

VENUS
ESPN maybe I think I’m getting
interviewed next

MACCI
Think there’s enough film in that
camera for both of you

OFF Richard enjoying the spotlight as we hear --

ESPN REPORTER (PRE-LAP)
Youve faced a lot of criticism in
the last three years since you
pulled your daughters out of
Junior Tournament tennis

THE PATHWAY BETWEEN CENTER COURT AND COURT 14 - LATER
Richard is now walking with the reporter and cameraman

ESPN REPORTER
Youve been called controversial
overbearing a self promoting
distraction How do you respond to
all that

RICHARD
Peoples can think what they want
but I know that when somebody come
to me and tell me how good my
daughter is that she should be
playing matches the only reason
they see good is ‘cause they see
money that could go in their
pocket

( )

ESPN REPORTER
But you’ve certainly said a lot of
provocative things You’ve said
tennis parents should be shot You
said you’re brokering a deal to
purchase Rockefeller Center

RICHARD
Truth is I’ve got so many
businesses now I hardly think
about tennis

ESPN REPORTER
And you’re not concerned all that
is holding them back Most top
prospects their age like Martina
Hingis for example are about to
turn pro but your daughters
havent played a match since 1991

RICHARD

No we been pushing them forward
Venus’ speaking four languages
Most of ‘em fluently almost How
many languages you speak

(off his stunned

silence)
Exactly Not even good at this
one Look Ive been broke all my
life and Venus doesnt want to be
poor but nobody going to push our
daughter into anything

(Richard “breaks”

from the interview)
What’d you think of that last one
Maybe we should try that again I
liked your other take best

The Reporter dumbfounded They arrive outside Court 14

where Venus practices with Macci

RICHARD
Junior You got an interview
Cmon Let’s go

ON COURTS 14 AND 15 - SAME

Venus hears puts away a last serve

MACCI
Are you kidding Come on We got
another two hours You walk out

Richard yells out

Starts packing up

( )

Venus just shrugs knowing it’s not really her call and
keeps packing up as Rick looks to Richard displeased

RICHARD
Sorry Rick Showtime
MACCI
It’s always showtime isn’t it

Richard
Macci just throws up his hands and --

MACCI
Hey Meek Let’s go I know someone
wants to be here

ON THE CLUBHOUSE BALCONY OVERLOOKING COURTS - LATER

Venus now sits calm and collected with the Reporter for a
sit down ON CAMERA interview Richard watches behind
the monitors

ESPN REPORTER
Do you want to turn pro

VENUS

ESPN REPORTER
A lot of people are excited to see
how youd do against players like
Seles Do you think you can beat

VENUS

confident

Venus smiles

VENUS

VENUS

( )

ESPN REPORTER
But you haven’t played a match it
almost 3 years

RICHARD
Alright Hold it right there if
you don’t mind And let me tell
you why

And suddenly Richard steps out from behind the equipment
and gets straight in the Reporter’s face and his frame

ESPN REPORTER
Richard we’re doing an interview--

RICHARD
What she has said -- she said it
with so much confidence the first
time but you keep going on and
on

ESPN REPORTER
But we can’t keep interrupting
If you want to try and finish --

That is not going to happen Richard towers above him

RICHARD
You’ve got to understand that
youre dealing with an image of a
14-year-old child And this child
going to be playing when your old
ass and me gonna be in the grave
When she has said something we
done told you what’s happening
You’re dealing with a little black
kid And let her be a kid She
done answered it with a lot of
confidence Leave that alone

The Reporter is silent His trousers probably wet
Richard is frothing but --

We END ON Venus who’s attention has drifted off toward --
CENTER COURT below her where Venus can see there’s a buzz
in the air ALL THE OTHER COACHES AND KIDS at the

academy have surrounded CENTER COURT A MATCH UNDERWAY

off Venus intrigued --

EXT RICK MACCI TENNIS ACADEMY - COURTS 14 AND 15 - A FEW
MOMENTS LATER

Serena is SPARRING with Macci holding a punching bag

MACCI

Pow Serena sneaks in a blow when Macci’s attention is
turned by Venus’ return

MACCI

ORACENE

Scared that the world will look at

(beat)
And you think they might be right

Richard finally quiets and Oracene knows she’s hit him
close to the bone She takes a moment Comes to him

( )

ORACENE
I have never thought that about

EXT RICK MACCI TENNIS ACADEMY - TENNIS COURTS - NIGHT

POP POP POP Venus is alone on the court hammering
forehands against the ball machine Letting out her
frustration in a fury -- Boom Boom Boom Boom --
until she sees

Richard approaching the court

RICHARD
You hit them balls any harder you
gon’ break ‘em in half

Aware what he’s doing Venus doesn’t engage Just
continues to hit Trying her teenager best to ignore
him But he won’t let her do it Instead --

Richard picks up a racket and steps on the court He
turns off the ball machine and just like old times
begins to feed her from the basket

Venus is pissed She draws her hand across her face
(like Richard does in his moments of stress) and takes
her place on the baseline bristling with frustration

Richard feeds her a ball and Venus -- BOOM -- blows it
past him on the court It’s a challenge Richard feeds
her another and -- BANG -- Venus fires it back him so

fast he has to duck out of the way

Richard’s starting to realize He feeds again and again
and each time that he does --

Venus hits the shit out of the ball with more fury and
grace then he’s ever seen in his life and it’s clear
she’s not still just a kid on that court back in Compton

By the time Richard stops Venus’ eyes spill with tears

RICHARD
What You think you should play

( )

VENUS
I don’t know why you won’t let me
‘Less you think I’m not ready

Richard waves her forward and they stand like opponents
on opposite sides of the net

RICHARD

When I was a little boy I grew up
in Shreveport One day my father
took me to town He gave me this
money to pay this white man for
something Back in them days
black folks wasn’t allowed to
touch white peoples So I went to
give the man this money and I
accidentally touched his hand and
he start beating on me He knocked
me down His friends come over
they all start stomping on me
beating on me And I look up and
see my father in the crowd and he
took off running Left me there
with these grown men beating on
me

Now I haven’t been no great
daddy But I’ve never done nothing

be hard for anybody But for you

down

long rally but it ends when Venus -- very tight short
arms a backhand into the net

attuned to a change and --

On the next point Venus pockets the first serve into the
net and carves in a slow second which --

BOOM -- Vicario blasts it off the court for a winner A

But it doesn’t feel quite like she’s leading

The crowd can sense blood Macci can too And two very
quick games later --

Venus is serving again trying to regain her composure

but her mojo is gone Vicario’s taken it She’s waiting
on the other side of the net with a scowl

( )

Venus tosses her serve smacks it clean but Vicario’s
there -- winding up salivating ready to knock the cover
off the ball and --

WE COULD FREEZE IT RIGHT THERE Because Venus doesn’t
win another game for the rest of the match

IN THE TUNNEL Richard watches Vicario take control
winning point after point and game after game

CHAIR UMPIRE
Game Vicario
(again)
Game Vicario
(finally)
Second set Vicario

Venus never stops fighting taking a nasty fall on the
court rising back to her feet but knows the moment has
passed

IN THE TUNNEL Richard hurts for his daughter Knowing
it’s slipping a way His eyes turn to the exit as --

ON COURT Vicario moon-balls her way through another long
rally that Venus finally ends sailing a backhand long

Venus shakes her head in disgust Feeling frustrated and
alone until Venus looks up in surprise to see --

In the stands there’s her father -- taking the empty
seat beside Oracene for the rest of the match Watching
not running

Venus understands So does Oracene She takes Richard’s
hand and together they support their daughter as --

In what feels like no time the score reads 6-2 3-6
0-5 Venus is serving but it’s match point Vicario
After the return Venus sails a forehand long and like
that it’s all done She has lost

Just like that dignified girl back in juniors Venus
walks graciously to the net and shakes Vicario’s hand
It’s a moment of chivalry and Richard is proud only --

The rug still has been pulled out The crowd is
applauding but the bubble’s been burst The defeat feels
enormous They bet the house and they lost

HOLD ON Richard clapping stoically applauding his
daughter but knowing she’s hurting and --

INT LOCKER ROOM - OAKLAND COLOSSEUM ARENA - NIGHT

Once she’s inside the door’s closed her disappointment
pours out like the 14-year-old kid that she is Her
parent arrive cloaking her in their arms as she cries

VENUS
I shoulda won tonight All the
deals the respect You were
counting on me

RICHARD

Don’t you worry about those deals
I bet outside out that door the
hallway’s full of fools just
fighting to hand you a check but
that’s not what’s important

(beat)
Look at me You just went toe to
toe for two hours with the best
player in the world and you made
her knees shake and you did it
with grace You don’t have respect
for yourself now you ain’t gon’
never have none You’re a
champion Venus Williams and the
whole world knows it Walk out
with your head up

(finally)
I have never been more proud of a
person in my whole life

Venus smiles for her father’s sake but she’s holding
back tears afraid he isn’t right and --

RICHARD
Let’s go

Richard grabs Venus’ bag and they head for the door but --

VENUS

RICHARD

VENUS
No I got it

Richard understands He hands Venus her bag and she
carries it herself out into --
