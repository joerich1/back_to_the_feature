INT DALTONS CELL - UNDETERMINED

Pan right to left across a cream-painted cinder block wali
Various items taped to the walt A page from Playboy a
handwritten calendar bible quotations on scrap paper a
check ist We pan left to the adjacent wall and stop in an
ECU of DALTON RUSSELL 36 white with ten days of beard

AS WE PULL BACK

DALTON
My name is Dalton Russell Pay strict
attention toe what say because choose
my words carefully and never repeat
myself

He wears no shirt A tattoo on his chest says “Murder wil
out Certain it will not fail - Chaucer He reads a small
worn Bible wears white light cotton drawstring pants and
sits up on a mattress with his back to the wall

DALTON (CONTD)
l’ve tofd you my name Thats the ‘who’
The ‘where’ could most readily be
described as a prison cell But there’s a
vast difference between being stuck’in a
tiny cetl and being in prison And am
not in prison The ‘what’ is easy
Recentiy planned and set in motion
events to execute the perfect bank
robbery Thats atso the ‘when’ As for
the ‘why’ beyond the obvious financial
motivation its exceedingly simple
Because can Which leaves us only with
the ‘how’ And therein as the Bard would
tell us lies the rub

that box that you don’t even want your
closest aides knowing about Thats not a
problem for me If dont need to know
whats in there just tell me that
don’t need to know But if you tel me
its a bunch of old basebal cards and
find out it’s launch codes for nuclear

missiles well at that point we no

Two there was an American working for a
bank in Switzertand Now don’t need to
tell you that when you lift up a rock
you find a bunch of slime getting fucked
over by a Swiss banker And Ima thief
Theyve been profiting off of the world’s
misery for centuries and theyre proud
of it And certainly this period in
history was rife with opportunity for
people of such tow morals Peopte like
this one American He used his position
to enrich himself while alt around him
people were being stripped of everything
they owned tortured starved murdered
and burnt in ovens or buried alive Then
he used some of his blood money to start
a bank Now in the case of the Swiss
hey thats just who they are But the
idea that an American would do that
collaborate with the enemy for financial
gain that offends me personally

make a difference And the only real

We catch glimpses of the opposite wall to the teft of him

evidence of a hastily constructed facade

the ‘why’ beyond the obvious financial
motivation it’s exceedingly simple
