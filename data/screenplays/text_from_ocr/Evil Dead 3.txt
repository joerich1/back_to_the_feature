1 GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE - CLOSE-UP - A MANS DESPERATE FACE 1
This is Ash mid twenties square jaw firmly set and a pair of
haunted eyes which dart about quickly in fear Ash speaks to
the CAMERA with urgency

ASH
Why would you say that I am
insane I wouldnt say that Ive
lost my mind simply because Ive
heard the voices and seen the
godless things moving in the
woods If anything I think more
clearly now than ever before I
know now that there is such a
thing as a living Evil A dark
and shapeless thing that lives
not in the spaces we know but
between them In the Dark In the
night And it wants the exact same
thing as you and I a chance at
warm life on this Earth It
doesnt care that is already had
that chance once Now listen
closely because there isnt much
time Listen and believe because
its all true

ASH (VO)
I first saw the damn thing at that

in human flesh and inked in human
blood It contained bizarre burial
rites prophesiesand
instruction for demon
resurrection It was never meant
for the world of the living
