The SONG is BARBARA ANN

CAMERA PANS across our BEACH BOYS LOOKALIKES -- all is as it
should be -- till we reach the DRUMMER The YOUNG KEITH MOON

MOON does not thrash his kit but plays an easygoing beat

For he is in his fantasy a BEACH BOY And his drum kit is
ELEVATED at the FRONT and CENTRE of the stage

KEITH
I should have been a BEACH BOY
No question I loved that music above
all others That and the Calfornia
LIFESTYLE Sun Sand Surf And

year old lad from Wembley want
But oo did I end up with

ever seen on a riser on stage

This is KEITH at 25 Its 1971 The BAND as KEITHs drums
proudly state is THE WHO
The scene plays without dialogue Well hear the dialogue later

KEITH obviously out of it alternately PLAYS LIKE A MANIAC and

SLOWS TO A CRAWL The GUITARIST of THE WHO -- PETE TOWNSHEND --
screams something at him The BASS PLAYER -- JOHN ENTWISTLE --
shakes his head stoically plays on The SINGER -- ROGER DALTRY -

- concentrates on tossing his MICROPHONE over the audience and
reeling it back in with panache

KEITH glares resentfully at the back of DALTRYS HEAD

KEITH VO
Instead I had this other bloke
forever stood in front of me Nothing
personal -- but I hated staring at
every one of his golden curls I should
have been in front of HIM I hated
being behind ANYONE Hated it hated
it DID NOT LIKE IT AT ALL

Flailing KEITH PASSES OUT ON THE DRUMS TWO MEN rush him from
either side and JAB HYPODERMIC NEEDLES INTO HIS ANKLES Cortisone

Beneath a poster of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN KEITH puts a BBC
SOUND EFFECTS RECORD on his grampohone turntable He carries the
TURNTABLE to the window and points the SPEAKER at the PAVEMENT

below where an unsuspecting OLD LADY hobbles

KEITH lowers the needle The sound of an approaching EXPRESS

The OLD LADY hits the pavement looking frantically around for the
TRAIN

KEITH VO

BUGLE An enormous OLD RADIO blares out The Goon Show --

the immortal comic antics of PETER SELLERS SPIKE MILLIGAN HARRY
SEACOMBE and MICHAEL BENTINE

Through a WALL HATCH to the KITCHEN we see KEITHS MUM preparing
TRIFLE by mixing tinned fruit cocktail and tinned custard

KEITH watches this even more depressed

The sound of PETER SELLERS VOICE in the character of HERCULES
GRITPIPE-THYNNE can be heard

In the background we hear a SONG not yet composed --
BORIS THE SPIDER
KEITHS MUM goes out of frame And a CARTOON SPIDER -- big
black hairy mean with the FACE of PETER SELLERS -- descends on
a sticky string to KEITHs eye level
SPIDER
(voice of GRITPIPE-THYNNE )
Pssst Lad Boy Attention

KEITH stares at the SPIDER dropping the bugle

SPIDER
Like it here do you

KEITH wordlessly shakes his head
SPIDER
Fancy a chance to get out of
Wembley -- never to return
KEITH wordlessly assents
SPIDER
Ill bet youd do anything to
get out wouldnt you
KEITH NODS more vigorously
SPIDER
Anything at all In return for
Fame Fortune Young ladies
THE LOVE OF THE MASSES
KEITH JUMPS TO HIS FEET IN INCREDIBLE EXCITEMENT

A PARCHMENT PAPER and QUILL PEN descend from the ceiling by
another STICKY THREAD

SPIDER
Sign here

KEITH grabs the PARCHMENT eagerly and starts to read --

SPIDER
Dont read it lad Just sign

KEITH nods feverishly signing the PAPER which is WHIPPED from
his hands and DISAPPEARS the same way it came

SPIDER
Be seeing you Need anything else
for now

KEITH looks at him then dares to WHISPER --

KEITH
Scare me mum

The SPIDER nods scuttles through the HATCH
A WOMANS PIERCING SCREAM is heard

completely calm

A MONSTER WAVE approaches KEITH whos never been on a board
before watches as the other SURFERS paddle and SHOUT at him to do
the same

KEITH starts to paddle -- then the WAVE catches him and picks him
up -- hes hanging onto both sides of the board --
SURFERS
Stand up man Stand up

KEITH stands up

And for a TRANSCENDENT MOMENT HE IS SURFING
Standing atop his board in a great funnel of water

Then he sees the CORAL REEF approaching -- bales out --

For a second KEITH is submerged then he surfaces rests happily
on the sunlit water

He opens his eyes and SEES HIS SURF BOARD HURTLING OUT OF THE SKY
TOWARDS HIS HEAD --

He dives again --

The BOARD whacks him underneath the water

hands on the SOFA takes KIMS HANDS And looking soulfully into

her eyes begins to SING

KEITH

PAUL
Why was BUDDY HOLLYs life so great
Because it was so short Because
it was - along with RICHIE VALENS
and the BIG BOPPERs - so tragically
snuffed out at such an early age
What is our fascination with these
great artists - JANIS JIMI JIM -
who passed away so young in the
prime of their musical greatness
Never giving us - their fans - a
chance to LOSE OUR FAITH IN THEM

Bar-bar-bar Bar-bra Ann
Bar-bar-bar Bar-bar-bra Ann

A SPIDER runs across the TELEVISION SCREEN

KEITH leaps out of bed flailing madly at it with a rolled-up
magazine

A KNOCK AT THE WINDOW

KEITH turns snarling But sees the face pressed to the window
of PETER SELLERS in a long blond hippie wig waving a BOTTLE

KEITH
(eyes fill with hope)
PETER SELLERS

He runs and THROWS THE WINDOW OPEN
PETER SELLERS climbs into the room limping as if he were the

BRITISH AIR FORCE OFFICER from DR STRANGELOVE This convulses
KEITH

SELLERS
Thanks awfully Keith old chap
Strings gone in my gammy leg
again

KEITH falls back on the bed watching SELLERS rapt
Maybe now everythings going to be all right

SELLERS
(accent of LA BEACH BUM)
Party party Moonie Get us a couple
of glasses wouldja

KEITH happily fetches two glasses then remembers hes not
drinking He laughs at himself sits on the floor beside SELLERS

hands him one glass clutches his pills

SELLERS pours himself a drink and toasts KEITH

SELLERS
Cheers
KEITH
(takes a pill)
Cheers

KEITHS FACE CONVULSES WITH LAUGHTER --

CUT TO --

SAME LATER

TEARS OF HILARITY roll down KEITHs face as PETER SELLERS
entertains him with nonstop patter and brilliant character
changes

ANGLE ON SELLERS --

CAREENING ROUND THE ROOM on a chair mimicking STRANGELOVE --

Bumping into HARRY NILSSONs surviving vases and knick-nacks
a la INSPECTOR CLOUSEAU --

Holding out his glass for KEITH to fill --

KEITH rapt pops yet another HEMINEVRIN PILL

SELLERS
Im a controversial figure My friends
either dislike me or hate me I can

be difficult impossible loathsome
but at my best UNAPPROACHABLY GREAT
Sure you dont want a drink

KEITH is completely out of it on the PILLS
KEITH

No no fine Cheers
(he pops another one)

SELLERS
Why am I great I often ask myself
that question And wait What

is this
ANGLE ON AN OLD ROLLED-UP PARCHMENT CONTRACT --
-- which SELLERS pulls from his Hippie Purse

SELLERS
Why Its the CONTRACT which I signed
all those years ago selling MY SOUL
in return for IMMORTAL FAME

SELLERS dangles it in front of KEITH

When KEITH reaches for it SELLERS snatches it back opens it
and reads

SELLERS

But just a minute This isnt MY
contract This is YOURS Keith
Signed Wembley 1961

(shivers )
I would have done anything to get
out of Wembley too Did your mother
have one of those HATCHES

(KEITH nods)
Lets check out the small print here
Hmmm didnt do as well as me on
that clause Dont like the look
of that Still you got what you
wanted didnt you

KEITH beams expansively

KEITH
Yeah the LOVE of EVERYONE

SELLERS
Well their attention anyway

They both dissolve into giggles

KEITH yawning crawls into bed begins to fall asleep

KEITH

Cant quite stay awake

Come back tomorrow night All right
SELLERS

Oh Ill be seeing you
HOLD ON KEITHS MOONLIKE FACE
Totally blissed out

KEITH VO

I finally had everything

Id got out of Wembley

Peter Sellers was my friend
IN HIS SLEEP

KEITH reaches for the HEMINEVRIN BOTTLE and pops two more pills

He snores noisily

SAME MORNING

ANNETTE enters warily carrying a T-BONE STEAK on a tray

The BEDROOM WINDOW is open There is no other indication PETER
SELLERS was ever there

ANNETTE
Keith Breakfast

KEITH wakes groggy from the PILLS

KEITH
Great Thanks love
He tucks into the MEAT still half asleep

KEITH
Fancy a Chinese later

ANNETTE
Sure Keith Chinese would be great

Having devoured the MEAT KEITH pops another HEMINEVRIN
down with orange juice ANNETTE heads for the door

KEITH
Annette

ANNETTE
Yes Keith

KEITH

Would you say that I was still
the best Keith Moon-style drummer
in the world

ANNETTE
Yes Keith of course

KEITH smiles settles back on his pillow

CUT TO --

She doesnt notice -- though we do -- that KEITH is staring

sightlessly at the ceiling His breathing has stopped

HE IS DEAD
