EXT A SYCAMORE TREE - DAY - FIVE YEARS AGO

A beautiful huge sycamore tree at the top of a hill somewhere
outside Seattle in one of the computer suburbs near Redmond

A moving truck is coming up the hill followed by an SUV

EXT LOSKI HOUSE - STREET - DAY

The moving truck pulls up in front of a very pleasant house
with a neat manicured front lawn and some pretty flowers
It’s one of the larger houses on the street

BRYCE LOSKI 8 gets out of the passenger side of the moving
van He’s already handsome for good His father RICK gets
out of the driver’s side Bryce and his father dress
similarly

The SUV pulls into the driveway and Rick’s wife PATSY LOSKI
and their daughter LYNETTA 12 get out Patsy is trim
blond cheerful pert the kind of woman who is always a
little too pulled-together

POV LOSKI HOUSE - FROM THE UPPER FLOOR OF THE HOUSE ACROSS
THE STREET

The four Loskis walk up the front walkway to their new house
and stand there staring at it Then Bryce turns to look at
the house across the street and we hear

JULI (V0O)
The first day I met Bryce Loski I
flipped

EXT BAKER HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET - DAY

In the upper window we see JULI BAKER 8 looking out the
window across the street She’s a tomboy freckled
adorable

JULI (VO CONT)
Honestly one look at him and I
became a lunatic

She throws open the window and shouts across the street

JULI
Hi

The Loski family turns to look at the Baker house across the
street
flippedldmay21 2

It’s one of the smaller houses on the street and it’s as
eccentric a house as the Loski house is conventional It’s
not exactly ramshackle but the lawn needs cutting there’s a
Santa Claus on the roof there are several whirligigs in the
front yard and an old Toyota in the driveway The climbing
rose needs pruning A dog is sitting on the front porch and
he wakes up and barks in a kind of half-assed way as Julie
throws open the window

JULI
(shouting)
Hey hi I’m Juli Baker

PATSY
Bryce how nice I think she’s
exactly your age

LYNETTA
(up to Juli re Bryce)
I’m Lynetta This is my brother
Bryce Say hi peabrain

BRYCE
Lynetta zip it

JULI
Welcome to the neighborhood It’s
a great neighborhood You’1l love
it

On Bryce

BRYCE
(voice over)
All I ever wanted was for Juli
Baker to leave me alone

JULI
I’1l be right down

Juli slams the window shut

Rick Loski is looking at the Baker house at the Christmas
decorations on the roof

RICK
What are we going to do about those
Christmas decorations

PATSY
I thought you liked the Christmas
decorations
flippedidmay21 3

RICK
When we bought the house it was
Christmas I had no idea they kept
them up all year

Rick starts toward the moving van
RICK
How are we ever going to sell this
house if the house across the
street has Christmas decorations
all year
PATSY
We’re not selling this house We
just bought it
INT MOVING VAN - A FEW MINUTES LATER
Bryce and his father are in the moving van unloading boxes

Juli pops up She’s carrying her soccer ball

JULI
Here I am I love moving

BRYCE (VO)
Who loves moving

JULI
I’m great at moving

BRYCE (VO)
I found out later she’s great at
everything Absolutely everything
She climbs in agile as a monkey and begins moving boxes
RICK LOSKI
Hey those are valuable

EXT TRUCK - A SECOND LATER

Rick deposits Juli out of the truck and onto the ground

RICK LOSKI
Your mom’s probably wondering where
you are

JULI

She knows where I am
flippedldmay21 4

She picks up her soccer ball kicks it elaborately in the
air drops it on the back of her foot flips it back up into
the air and catches it

JULI

(to Bryce)
I have two older brothers Matt and
Mike who look like twins They
have no interest in kids our age
If they seem like they’re
interested in you they’re not
they just want to torture you
Some day you’1l be grateful to me
for this tip

BRYCE (VO)
How was I going to get rid of this
girl

RICK LOSKI
(to Bryce)
Bryce isn’t it time for you to
help your mother

BRYCE
Sure thing

Bryce jumps off the truck

BRYCE (VO)
I couldn’t believe it Dad to the
rescue He didn’t like her either
I mean what a show-off And my
own dad was putting the ditch play
in motion

Bryce starts toward the front door of his house But Juli
follows

JULI (V0O)
It was weird I started to follow
him --

BRYCE (VO)

I heard her coming after me but I
couldnt believe it --

Bryce looks over his shoulder sees Juli just behind him
JULI (V0)

I guess you’d have to say I was
chasing him up the walkway --
flippedldmay21

BRYCE (VO)
Maybe it just sounded like she was
chasing me I mean she couldn’t be
chasing me could she Why would
she be chasing me

JULI (VO)
I was just trying to stop him so
maybe we could play a little before
he got trapped inside --

BRYCE (VO)
-- and she blasted right past me
grabbing my arm --

Juli passes Bryce grabs his arm and stops him

JULI (V0O)
-- and the next thing I know he’s
holding my hand looking right into
my eyes --

Hold on them
On Bryce looking at Juli
On Juli looking at Bryce

JULI (V0)
My heart stopped It just stopped
beating I mean his eyes

BRYCE (VO)
I tried to shake her off but she
just clamped on tight

JULI (V0O)
They were gorgeous And they were
staring straight at me

BRYCE (VO)
She looked so sappy I couldn’t
believe it

JULI (V0O)
I almost got my first kiss that
day I was sure of it

BRYCE (VO)
If my mother hadn’t come out of the
door at that moment --
flippedldmay21 6

JULI (V0O)
If his mother hadn’t come out
there’s just no telling what might
have happened --

Bryce’s mother comes out the front door and looks at the two
of them

PATSY
Well I see you’ve met my son

Bryce untangles himself and shoots straight into the house
ROLL CREDITS

END CREDITS

EXT SAME STREET
FOUR YEARS LATER

Bryce is now 12 years old He’s mowing the lawn sitting on
the very latest version of an electric lawn mower

BRYCE (VO)
It’s four years later and guess
what Nothing’s changed The only
real difference is that Grandma
died mom’s mom so Grandpa moved
in

We see the front porch of the Loski house Sitting on it is
CHET DUNCAN Patsy Loski’s father a man in his early
seventies On the table next to him is a Tom Clancy book and
a copy of the newspaper but Chet isn’t reading he’s just
sitting there

We see the Baker house It’s slightly shabbier than it was
and there are more Christmas decorations The grass is
longer than ever

BRYCE (VO)
And meanwhile I’ve still got my own
personal stalker --

Up in the Baker window we see Juli who’s now 12 too She
looks out the window at Bryce who’s mowing the lawn

JULI
Hey Bryce Good work

Bryce goes on mowing
flippedldmay21 7

Julis father ROBERT BAKER pulls his battered pick-up truck
into the driveway A painted sign on the side of the truck
says Robert Baker general contractor MATT and MIKE Juli’s
older brothers who are both 16 but not twins get out of the
truck with their father and start into the house

BRYCE (VO)

My dad had this idea that if we did
a really great job on our front
lawn it might inspire the Bakers to
clean up their yard but guess
what it didn’t

PATSY
Dinner everybody

Bryce turns off the mower and starts into the house past his
grandfather

INT LOSKI HOUSE - DUSK

The Loski family is at the dinner table Food is being
passed Lynetta now 16 lots of eye makeup takes a tiny
portion Bryce helps himself Rick is eating spaghetti No
Grandpa

PATSY

LYNETTA
Could be

She breaks up a tiny piece of a pasta strand and puts it into
her mouth chews it slowly

PATSY
(calling to her
grandfather who’s still
outside)

Her father shakes his head no

EXT LOSKI HOUSE - NIGHT

On Bryce listening through the wall to a barely-audible
fight between his parents

PATSY

the same situation --

PATSY
I am not sending him to a home --

RICK
He hates me

PATSY

About EIGHT KIDS are standing under it waiting for the
school bus Bryce joins them A beat Four of the kids are
girls including SHELLY STALLS another seventh grader who is
hanging around with her friends They’re all in tank tops
and jeans and lots of accessories Most of them are wearing
I-Pods

Hi Shelly

ALL THE OTHER GIRLS
Hi Bryce

JULI (SHOUTING)
The bus is three blocks away

Everyone looks up Juli is sitting about halfway up the
sycamore tree She can see the road

JULI
Two and a half

Everyone stares at each other and shrugs Typical Juli

Juli starts to shimmy down the tree There’s a spiral slide
halfway down and Juli puts her arms out into the air as if
she’s flying She lands on the ground just as the bus is a
block away

JULI
(to the group)
Here’s the thing about sycamore
trees you almost never find them
all bunched up together They are
individual They do not need
company

The bus stops and everyone starts to get into it

INT BUS -— CONTINUOUS
Bryce sits down in the bus with his friend GARRETT

Juli sits right in front of him with her friend DARLA
flippedldmay21 10

DARLA
Hey Jules --

JULI

Hey Darla Bryce do you realize
that tree could be a hundred years
old easily Which means it could
practically be the oldest thing in
this entire town

BRYCE (VO)
Here’s the deal I always tried to
ignore Juli but she always ended
up sucking me in

JULI
It could be two hundred years old

BRYCE
I seriously doubt that

JULI
Well it could

On Bryce determined to ignore Juli

JULI
(continued)
It could
BRYCE

That tree is an ugly mutant tangle
of gnarly branches

DARLA
Bryce Loski how can you say that
about a tree

JULI

He can’t help it He’s visually
challenged

(she pulls a sycamore leaf

out of her notebook)
A lot of people confuse the
sycamore leaf with a maple but it’s
not

She hands the leaf to Bryce

JULI
Keep it
flippedldmay21 11

INT CLASSROOM - DAY
In front of the class is the teacher MISS BRUBECK

MISS BRUBECK
The science fair is in six weeks --

Juli is sitting behind Bryce

Every so often Juli leans forward and takes a sniff
Bryce’s hair

MISS BRUBECK
-- and good science projects take
time

Shelly Smalls looks over at Juli leaning forward to
Bryce

BRYCE (VO)
Here’s something I forgot to
mention On top of everything
else she liked to sniff me --

JULI (V0)
His hair smelled like watermelon --

BRYCE (VO)
And she thought I didn’t know she
was doing it --

JULI (V0)
So I would just lean over very
subtly and I swear to God he never
even knew I was taking a whiff --

Juli notices at Shelly Stalls is staring at her She stops
sniffing Bryce’s hair Shelly smirks at her and rolls her

eyes at her friend MIRANDA

MISS BRUBECK
Shelly do you have some problem
with the science project

SHELLY
No Miss Brubeck

MISS BRUBECK
So please have your projects in
mind by next Monday

The bells rings

Everyone is filing out of the room Juli is gathering up her
things

MISS BRUBECK
Do you have a science project
Juli

JULI
No But I will

MISS BRUBECK
Of course you will

JULI
Although I wish I knew what it was

MISS BRUBECK
I have a friend who has chickens
I could get you fertilized eggs
and you could hatch them --

JULI
What if they die

MISS BRUBECK
Well if you document it you’1l
still get an A if that’s what you
care about

JULI
I don’t care about getting an A

Miss Brubeck looks at her

JULI
Okay I do

Miss Brubeck smiles at her

INT BAKER HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK

Juli’s mother TRINA is cooking dinner She’s tall and
pretty wearing jeans and a pullover sweater Juli is making
a salad which she puts on the table

As Mike Matt and Robert come into the kitchen

JULI
I might hatch chickens for the
science project Miss Brubeck can
get me eggs --

TRINA
Why don’t you just grow beans
JULI
That’s like a third-grade thing
MIKE
Make a volcano
MATT
Volcano dude
JULI
Volcanos are so lame They are so
“boy”
ROBERT

I could help you make an incubator

JULI
You could

TRINA
Something smells funny in here Do
you smell something funny

MATT
Nope
INT LOSKI HOUSE —- NIGHT

Dinner Rick Patsy Lynetta Bryce and Patsy’s father Chet
Chet is not saying anything

BRYCE
Whatever I do I am not doing the
volcano thing
flippedldmay21 14

LYNETTA

Why don’t you do plants
BRYCE

Plants
LYNETTA

You plant two sets of plants and
one of them you talk to and the
other one you don’t talk to and
then you see which one grows more

BRYCE
Oh sure Me talking to plants
RICK
What’s wrong with the volcano
thing
LYNETTA

It is so lame

INT BAKER BASEMENT - NIGHT

There are six eggs in a hygrometer labeled Abby Bonnie

Clyde Dexter Eunice and Florence

Juli is watching her father paint a landscape
is filled with painter’s supplies

ROBERT
A painting is all about light of
course it’s also about
composition and about whatever
youre painting but it’s the light
that makes a painting more than the
sum of its parts --

The basement

On Robert painting His brush dips into the oil paints and
onto the canvas dappling light into the landscape

INT LOSKI KITCHEN - MORNING

Lynetta is getting ready to go to school Rick is pouring
coffee Patsy reading the paper Bryce eating breakfast

LYNETTA
Okay Here’s another idea You
put celery in red ink
flippedldmay21 15

BRYCE
Which proves what

LYNETTA
(as to an idiot)
The ink turns the celery red
proving that a plant sucks up
moisture It’s like putting a
flower in water

BRYCE
So why not just put a flower in
water

LYNETTA

Why I bother helping you I will
never know I know build a
computer

PATSY
What’s the Baker girl doing

BRYCE
She is hatching eggs

RICK
That girl loves to grandstand

EXT SKY - DAY

A beautiful blue kite is flying in the sky
flippedldmay21 17

Juli and Darla walk home from school They’re kicking a
soccer ball down the block When they get to Darla’s house
Darla peels off with the soccer ball

Julie continues on and looks up to see the kite
It crashes into the top of the sycamore tree
On Juli looking up at the tree

JULI (V0)
I always knew the sycamore tree was
the greatest tree ever It hada
built-in slide almost a complete
spiral and it was great to ride it
down But I’d never been to the
top until the day the kite got
caught up there

Juli starts to climb the tree
Inside the tree as she gets higher and higher

She looks up and there’s the kite flashing through the
branches

She looks down and realizes she’s way up in the tree

Now she looks out and sees Bryce He’s looking up at the
tree

JULI (V0)
And then it turned out to be
Bryce’s kite

BRYCE
Hey you don’t have to get that --

JULI (V0)
I can get it --

BRYCE
It’s too high you’ll fall --

JULI
I can get it --

She shinnies up higher She looks around Higher than she’s
ever been
flippedldmay21 18

BRYCE
Hey it’s okay I can get another
kite Juli you’re making me
nervous
Juli gulps

JULI
No problem

She reaches out for the kite But the string is tangled
She untangles it For a moment she almost loses her balance

BRYCE
Break the string

Juli reaches out to break the string and grabs the kite

And suddenly she’s on top of the tree looking out

Juli’S POV The view is heart-stopping A gorgeous sky in
blues and violets fluffy clouds she could float away on
sunlight dappling the tree-tops and roofs

ON JULIANA on top of the tree turning her head to see the
world from every angle The light changes every which way
she looks

WIDE SHOT A young girl at the top of a giant sycamore tree
CLOSE ON Juli elated

Juli looks into the incubator

One of the eggs is starting to hatch

JULI

INT AUDITORIUM - SCIENCE FAIR - NIGHT

As Bryce with his parents walks in carrying a large
cardboard tray with a mound of sand piled onto it This is a
volcano

BRYCE (VO)
But not Juli It’s a miracle she
didn’t turn up at the science fair
in a chicken suit

At least six other boys have also made volcanos One of the
boys lights a match The top of his volcano starts to
sputter Imitation lava flows down the side

No one is looking at that volcano or at Bryce

Nor are they looking at Shelly Stalls’ science project which
is a study of how long lipstick stays on your mouth in
comparison to lip gloss There are fifteen large photographs
of Shelly’s lips Shelly stands there

SHELLY
Hi Bryce

She puckers her lips at him
But Bryce is looking over at a crowd of people

They’re looking at Juli and her incubator Tiny fuzzy chicks
and two little eggs cracking open

BRYCE (VO)
Listen to this she actually
managed to time it so the last two
eggs hatched during the fair
A baby chick emerges from the shell
THE ENTIRE GROUP OF SPECTATORS AWWWWWWWW

Juli stands on stage in front of a row of judges She has

her incubator and a huge bulletin board with photos and
diagrams She has a laser pointer

BRYCE (VO)

(with disdain)
And yes that is a laser pointer
To light this diagram or that part
of the incubator or this section of
the chart and talk about how
unbelievably exciting --

Bryce eyes narrowed watches
JULI
(to the judges)
It was unbelievably exciting --
BRYCE (VO)
-- it was to watch eggs grow for

twenty-one days

ON THE AUDIENCE watching Juli’s parents and Matt and Mike
so proud Juli’s friend Darla watching too

BRYCE (VO)
And guess what

The audience bursts into applause

INT SCIENCE FAIR - AN HOUR LATER

BRYCE (VO)
That’s right She won first prize

JULI
And I want to thank mom who is such
a great supporter my amazing Dad
who helped me build the incubator
and my brothers who did nothing --
The audience laughs

On Bryce not laughing

So that’s how we wound up with
chickens
(continued)
flippedldmay21 23

HOLD ON THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE

EXT BAKER YARD - DAY - A MONTH LATER
Six chickens in the front yard

JULI (VO CONT)

But what none of us thought of was
that six chickens scratching for
bugs not only gets rid of bugs it
also tears up grass So pretty
soon there was nothing whatsoever
left of our yard

(continued)

We see there’s almost no grass left in the yard

Across the street we see Bryce mowing the perfect Loski
lawn

JULI (VO )
And I’m sorry to say this but
chicken feed attracts mice
(continued)

We see Matt and Mike setting out some very simple
mousetraps

JULI (VO )
So my brothers decided as long as
weve got mice might as well get a
snake Snakes love mice

INT BAKER HOUSE - DAY

BRYCE
That’s the name of the band

PATSY
What kind of parents would let
their children name a band
something like that It’s vile
flippedidmay21 29

RICK
Their house is worth more because
they’re across the street from us
and our house is worth less because
we’re across the street from them

They all look at the carton of eggs Patsy picks one up
turns it around

PATSY
What if you cracked it open and
there was a chick in it

LYNETTA
Ewwww

She puts it back into the carton

BRYCE
I’m having cereal

RICK

To be perfectly honest I’ve never
been entirely sure how an egg gets
fertilized

(he laughs)
I know I should know I know
roosters have to be involved
Birds do it bees do it but how do
they do it

PATSY
Do they have sex with the hens

RICK
Well they must

He shrugs
A pause at the table

PATSY
They must

A beat
Chet looks up from his newspaper
CHET
As with all birds there has to be

mating for fertilization to occur
(continued)
flippedldmay21

Chet is speaking Everyone is riveted

CHET (CONTD)
Although it’s not particularly
romantic The rooster picks a hen
usually on the basis of proximity
grabs her by the back of the head
climbs on her back and you can
pretty much figure out the rest
The whole thing takes about 15
seconds give or take and as far as
anyone can tell the only
satisfying thing about the
encounter as far as the hen is
concerned is that afterwards she
fluffs up her feathers

(beat)

In any case there are no roosters
at the Bakers I will swear to it
If there were roosters we would
know You can hear roosters

LYNETTA
Cock a doodle doo

CHET
Exactly

PATSY

(so pleased that he’s
finally said something)
Grandpa

Chet goes back to his newspaper

BRYCE
I’m having seconds on cereal

BRYCE
Well it’s easy to find out if there
are roosters Just ask Lynetta to
ask Juli’s brothers

PATSY
What are their names again

BRYCE
Matt and Mike Or get Lynetta to
get Skyler to ask them

LYNETTA
Shut up Bryce

LYNETTA
Haven’t you noticed I haven’t been
going down there jerk

BRYCE

PATSY
Did something happen with you and
Skyler

LYNETTA

EXT LOSKI BACK YARD - NIGHT

Rick and Bryce are putting golf balls Chet is on the back

EXT ALLEY BEHIND BAKER HOUSE - DAY

As Bryce and his friend GARRETT come down the back alley to
the fence behind the Baker house

They look over it

A mess Much worse than the front yard There’s a makeshift
chicken coop and a few old pieces of lawn furniture Champ
the dog is asleep

EXT BAKER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Juli opens the back door and comes out of the house She’s
carrying a basket to gather eggs

GARRETT

INT LOSKI HOUSE - NIGHT
Back at the dinner table

BRYCE

touch them so don’t even ask

RICK
Why’s that

BRYCE
There’s poop all over the place

LYNETTA
Gross

BRYCE
Chicken turds everywhere

Lynetta stands up and leaves the table

LYNETTA
You expect me to eat after this

PATSY
Lynetta You have to eat
something
flippedldmay21 33

LYNETTA
No I don’t

She leaves the room and sticks her head back in

LYNETTA
Does the word salmonella mean
anything to you

She splits again

On Chet looking at Rick

Bryce

PATSY
Do you think the eggs could have
salmonella

BRYCE
Theyre probably packed with it
One bite --
(he grabs his neck and
pretends to gag to death)

RICK
I can’t believe you didn’t just ask
her You are afraid of that girl

BRYCE
She just bugs me She bugs you
too

RICK
Just take back the eggs and tell
them we don’t eat eggs Tell her
were allergic to them or
something

PATSY
Well that would be a lie You want
him to lie

RICK
That’s not the point The point
is he spies on someone’s yard
instead of asking a simple
question

RICK
(to Chet)
What is it

Clearly he thinks Rick is bullying
flippedldmay21 34

CHET
Nothing

Chet looks back down at his plate

(back to Bryce)

you to look that girl square in the
eye

red face who’s jumping up and down
like Rumpelstilskin --

Looking down at the crowd looking up into the tree we see
the owner who looks furious

And judging from my recent
introduction to him the
environment is not at the top of
his list of priorities --

going to see this view if he cuts
down the tree --

she’s flying

I just believe that the tree
belongs to all of us When

day then it’s not just one
person’s tree it’s everyone’s

Why are you throwing them away
flippedldmay21 54

BRYCE
Does the word salmonella mean

BRYCE
My mom doesn’t think it’s worth the
risk

The garbage truck arrives in front of the house and empties
the trash bags into the back of the truck

Juli is just standing there stunned as the noise of the
garbage truck makes conversation temporarily impossible

The truck pulls away

BRYCE
So that’s basically it

neighborly look at your yard It’s

I kept hoping Juli would soften up
a little but she just cut me dead -

Juli and some friends walk past Bryce who looks after her as
she walks down the hall

JULI (V0)

thinking about Bryce ‘cause it
gave me a lot of extra time to
focus on the important things like
school --

We see the eighth grade homeroom teacher MISS SIMMONS

Miss Simmons picks a stack of yellow papers off her desk
fans herself and says

MISS SIMMONS
It’s time to vote for basket boys

She starts passing out the papers

GARRETT
(sarcastically)
Who wants to be a basket boy

MISS SIMMONS
You do Garrett It’s an honor to
be a basket boy We’re electing
twenty boys from the class --

GARRETT
I do not want to be one of them --

MISS SIMMONS
Well you should Basket boys are
a tradition that has helped support
this school since it was founded
in 1983 It’s why we have flower
beds It’s why we have shade trees
and apple trees Visit another
school sometime and you’ll begin to
realize what a little oasis our
campus is

BRYCE
All this from the sweat and blood
of basket boys --
flippedldmay21 76

MISS SIMMONS
What did you say Bryce

BRYCE
Nothing Miss Simmons

SHELLY
(loud whisper)
I’m voting for you Bryce

MISS SIMMONS
Bryce some day when your children
go to school here you’1ll
understand

Bryce rolls his eyes at Garrett

He looks at the ballot

He looks over at Juli

She’s ignoring him and looking straight at her ballot

JULI (V0O)
I read down the list There were
158 names and twenty of them were
going to be basket boys and
auctioned off like sides of beef to
pay for some flowers But I
realized that to me there had only
ever been Bryce But I certainly
wasn’t going to vote for him I
just couldn’t What if I didn’t
choose anybody What if I just
turned it in blank

MISS SIMMONS
And don’t even think about not
voting or you will get detention

JULI (V0)
So I voted for the boys who weren’t
jerks or clowns but were just
nice Like Jon Trulock who was
really sweet --

We see Jon Trulock again

never done so much as toss a
baseball around with your own
grandson

BRYCE
Take it easy Dad

RICK
(to Chet)
Have you ever talked to Bryce
Been to his room Have you ever
sat on your own grandson’s bed and

You know why the Bakers haven’t
fixed up the yard until now
flippedlidmay21 80

RICK
Why Sure They’re trash

David At Greenhaven
RICK
And
CHET
And it’s very expensive to keep him
there --

Well that certainly explains
everything --
PATSY
Rick --
RICK

That’s the reason they never kept
the yard up They’ve got two
perfectly healthy boys over there
who could have mowed the lawn all
these years Just because theres
a retarded relative someplace

Rick stops suddenly aware that everyone is looking at him
horrified

CHET
I was engaged to be married to
someone named Geraldine McCarthy
oh yes they’d sent out the
invitations and they even had one
of those bridal showers deals I
remember someone gave us a big
plate from Marshall Field with
asparagus painted on it that was
the idea you used the plate just
for asparagus God forbid you
should put a string bean on it
Geraldine got so angry at me when I
broke off the engagement and she
had to return all the presents
including the asparagus plate but
I couldn’t help myself because I’d
met Renee and I couldn’t very well
get married to anyone else once I
did Of course then I had to
prove to Renee I was worthy of her
because I’d wasted all that time
with Miss Asparagus Plate

BRYCE
How did you do that
CHET
A grand gesture I made a grand
gesture
They come to a stop
CHET

Renee would have sat up in that
tree all night long

At the other end Bryce is shooting with some boys

He looks over and Juli dribbles toward the basket and leaps
into the air

Juli’s hair flows backward as if it’s windblown she looks

exactly as she did in the newspaper as if she’s on top of
the tree

INT LIBRARY - ANOTHER DAY
Bryce leans on his elbow and pretends to read but manages to
contort himself practically into a pretzel to watch Juli as
she moves around the library
FROM THE STACKS

Juli goes over and huddles in the stacks with Darla

The boy is positively lost in
Loveland Look at him

JULI
Look at him Shoot me first

Darla literally turns her that direction
Bryce has his hands over his eyes with his fingers slightly
separated so he can stare at Juli Quickly he closes his

fingers and looks down at his book

Darla cracks up

JULI

I have to go dinner there tonight
DARLA

I bet you’re the dessert girl

Mmmm mmmm
JULI

(laughing but horrified)
Stop it

She looks at Bryce who’s still watching her now from
underneath his book

Panic They both look away Bryce pretends he’s really
stretching

JULI
I’1l just tell my mom I can’t go
It’s just completely out of the
question

RICK
Oh the music thing

LYNETTA
Dad your sarcasm is not
appreciated

RICK
(to Robert)
How do you feel about that Robert

ROBERT
I learned a long time ago that I
have very little power over my
children So if they want to try
the music thing they try the music
thing --

gear for digital

CHET
Digital is weak don’t you think
You lose too much of the waveform

Everyone stares at Chet

BRYCE and JULI
(at the same time)
I’m sorry

They’re embarrassed

JULI
I shouldn’t have said that about
not being friends Your mom made
such a nice dinner

BRYCE
I shouldn’t have said anything
about your house I mean it’s your
house it was really rude and I
didn’t realize why it was such a
mess

Juli looks at him puzzled

BRYCE (CONT’D)
I mean your Uncle

JULI
My Uncle

BRYCE
Because you know it costs so much
where he’s staying and you couldn’t
afford to keep the yard up

Because of Greenhaven and
everything

JULI
Oh man oh man that is so
completely --

She’s almost inarticulate --
flippedldmay21

BRYCE
What did I do now

JULI

in things being all perfect and
manicured

Uncle David being here And then
Bryce figured out this stupid
explanation

ROBERT
Maybe Chet got confused

JULI
Not possible Chet would never
ever come up with anything like
that It’s Bryce Aaaaaaah

PATSY
He doesn’t have go anywhere

PATSY
(shouting from the stairs)

flippedidmay21

JULI
Tea Okay

INT KITCHEN - A FEW MINUTES LATER

As Trina puts the kettle on Juli paces back and forth

JULI
I mean I was over him Totally
over him

TRINA
I know

The phone rings
TRINA
It’s probably your dad
(answering)
Hello Hello Bryce

On Juli frantically shaking her head no

TRINA
She is not available I’m
sorry I will absolutely tell her
you called
She hangs up
JULI

Calling me Now he’s calling me
I’ve lived across the street from
him for five years and he’s never
once called me

Trina starts to smile
JULI
This is not funny I could end up

like Mrs Loski

TRINA
I don’t think so

JULI
Why not

flippedidmay21 119

TRINA
Because Bryce is not his father
And by the way Patsy’s having a
very hard time -- she’s been over a
couple of times this week to talk
things over I’m giving you
peppermint

She hands Juli a cup of tea

TRINA (CONTD)
My advice to you is don’t speak to
Bryce ever again --

JULI
I’m not going to Ever

TRINA
Good Because you might turn out
to be wrong about him And then
you might have to marry him

JULI
Mom I’m only thirteen

TRINA
That’s my point honey This is
not about marrying the boy Why
don’t you listen to what he has to
say Don’t be so sure about him
People change Especially when
they’re young

INT LOSKI HOUSE - SAME TIME

Bryce worked up into a frenzy is pacing in front of his
grandfather who is waiting patiently Bryce stops pacing

BRYCE
I can’t tell you

CHET
Fine Don’t tell me

BRYCE
I tried to kiss her at that stupid
Basket Boy lunch I tried to kiss
her

His grandfather starts to smile
flippedidmay21

CHET
You did

BRYCE
I was like possessed But she ran
away She won’t talk to me

CHET
Maybe she thinks it’s all a little
sudden

BRYCE
But it’s not

CHET
It’s not

BRYCE

No I mean it all started with
that dumb newspaper article which I
finally read and I don’t know
I’ve been crazy ever since She
doesn’t look the same she doesn’t
sound the same she’s just
different

CHET
Maybe you’re the one who’s
different

BRYCE
But she doesn’t know I’m different
How’s she going to know She’1ll
never know

CHET
Big problem

BRYCE
I need a grand gesture That’s
what I need A grand gesture
What was yours you know with
Grandma What’d you do

CHET
I gave her a key chain that said “I
love Chet” on it

BRYCE
Youre kidding

flippedlidmay21 121

CHET
I am kidding I did give her a key
chain that said “I love Chet” but
that wasn’t the grand gesture
I made her a bookshelf Renee
loved books She was a book-a-
night girl When you talked to her
and she was reading she didn’t
hear a thing you said And all her
books were just stacked up
everywhere or on terrible shelves
made of raw planks and bricks So
I took a class and I learned all
about dowels --

BRYCE
Dowels --

CHET
And I made her a bookshelf with not
one nail in it It was pine I
knew what I had to do The idea
popped into my head in a second and
I couldn’t believe it took even a
second it was so obvious

On Bryce He knows what he has to do

EXT JULI’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Bryce shows up in Juli’s front yard with a shovel and starts
digging

BRYCE (VO)
I had to ask Juli’s dad for
permission I mean you can’t just
dig a giant hole in someone’s front
yard without getting permission

A LITTLE LATER

The hole is dug Bryce is dirty and sweating There’s a big
pile of dirt and a bag of fertilizer

BRYCE (V0)
And thank god for the twinkle
lights or I wouldn’t have been able
to see a thing

LATER Bryce pushes a wheelbarrow carrying a baby sycamore
tree its roots all wrapped in burlap from his backyard over
to Juli’s
flippedlidmay21 122

BRYCE (VO)
It took me half the night and I was
worried the whole time that Juli
would wake up --
LATER

The tree is in the hole Bryce is shoveling dirt around the
roots

BRYCE
But luck was on my side

CUT TO

THE SUN STARTING TO RISE

INT BAKER HOUSE - MORNING

Juli comes downstairs

INT BAKER KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Matt and Mike and Juli’s parents are in the kitchen Matt
and Mike look at each other in a really goofy way Trina

covers her mouth to keep from smiling Robert buries his

face in the newspaper

JULI
What’s going on

Everyone shrugs

JULI
What is it

They all look at each other
ROBERT
You might want to take a look out
front --

Matt and Mike nod Trina is bursting

MATT
Out front

MIKE
Front yard
flippedlidmay21 123

MATT
Where to be

Juli starts out of the room

The family all stands to watch her

INT BAKER HOUSE ENTRY - CONTINUOUS

Julie walks to the front door

EXT BAKER HOUSE - DAY
As Juli comes out the front door

In the yard is the sycamore tree Bryce planted Hanging on
it by a ribbon is a card

JULI (V0O)
I knew the minute I saw it from
the shape of the leaves from the
texture of the trunk that it was a
sycamore tree
(continued)

As Juli looks at the card and we see Bryce’s handwriting
“For Juli from Bryce”

On Juli as she starts to tear up for moment wipes her eyes

JULI (VO )
I guess there are times in your
life when you realize that you’ve
been absolutely wrong about
someone and it makes you so happy
that you were wrong so blissfully
and amazingly happy you can’t even
believe it --

(continued)

She looks over at Bryce’s house
He’s in the window He waves
She waves back
JULI (VO )
I mean look at that tree Some
day it is going to be the most

amazing magnificent tree
(continued)
flippedldmay21 124

Juli starts to walk toward Bryce’s house
JULI (VO )
A hundred years from now it’ll be
miles in the air
(continued)

Bryce comes out the front door of his house and walks toward
Juli

JULI (VO )
And some day I bet that some kid
will climb it and it will change
her life the way it changed mine
Bryce and Juli meet in the middle of the street
They lean toward each other to kiss

Just before they actually kiss crane up to the light

THE LIGHT FILLS THE FRAME

HOLD ON THE LIGHT

And then magically

Branches grow up into the frame from the bottom spindly at
first getting stronger and leafier and more bountiful until
the branches of the sycamore tree fills the frame

PULL BACK

MANY YEARS IN THE FUTURE

The sycamore is now fully grown A YOUNG GIRL begins to
climb the tree We see flashes of her as she climbs to the

top and sunshine streaks through the branches

FADE OUT
