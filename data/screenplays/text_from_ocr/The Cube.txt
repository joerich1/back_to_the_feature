At first we see an eye Closed and slowly it opens up and looks
around Later we get a full view of a man lying on the floor

in a strange-looking room 4 walls 1 ceiling 1 floor 6 sides
just like a cube There is a kind of door on each side Each
door has a handle On the walls are weird-looking pictures
They doesnt seem to look like anything seen before The man

stands up in the middle of the room The camera pans around him

Then he makes some sounds and opens a door in one of the walls

As he looks in to the open door he sees a new room like the one

he is located in but the light in the new room is blue He
turns around and the door closes by itself Then he opens the
door in in the floor Under that door theres a new room
excatly like the first but in this room the light is red

The door closes He opens a new door in one of the walls

The light in there is red He looks back and then crawls into
the new room As he lands on the floor in the new room it makes
a loud sound and then the door closes behind him He takes one
step and then there is a loud sound The man stands still
Slowly he begins to bleed and slowly his body begins to fall
apart As the last parts of his body hits the floor we see

a sort of trelliswork First it moves to the floor and

afterwards it is being folded up
A man lies on the floor A door is open beside him Slowly

we see a hand trying to find something to hold on to A man

crawls up from the hole

QUENTIN

Hey

Quentin closes the door in the floor He sits down beside the

man lying on the floor and tries to wake him

QUENTIN

Hey

Quentin stands up and opens a door in one of the walls He
looks into a new room Red light He closes the door again

The man from before is now awake We hear a sound from one of
the other doors in the walls Quentin stands beside the door
preparing to attack whatever that comes out from there As
someone looks out Quentin grabs her by the neck throws her
to the floor and tries to beat her until he realises that
it is a lady The lady screams and sits down in a corner

of the room

QUENTIN

Im sorry Its alright Im not gonna hurt you

HOLLOWAY

What do you want

QUENTIN

I thought you were

HOLLOWAY

What

QUENTIN

I dont know

We hear a loud sound and everybody in the room looks around
As the sound stops someone screams for help Quentin opens
a door real fast As the camera switches to a new angle we
see a girl in a red room screaming for help When she sees

Quentin she walks towards him

QUENTIN

STOP

LEAVEN

What what

QUENTIN

Its ok come here

Quentin helps Leaven into the room where the others are
located Holloway helps Leaven out but not good enough
because Leaven falls and drops her glasses Leaven sits up

against a wall and Quentin comes towards her
QUENTIN

Its ok calm down evrythings gonna be fine

HOLLOWAY

What was in there

QUENTIN

Just give me a minute to figure things out

HOOLOWAY

Why are you afraid of that room

QUENTIN

QUENTIN
How many people are in this thing Listen We cant go

climbing around in here

HOLLOWAY
Why not

QUENTIN

Theres traps

HOLLOWAY

What do you mean traps

QUENTIN

Ubitraps I looked into a room down there and something almost cut my

head off

The old man crawls down to the others while Quentin talks

about the traps Leaven breathes heavily

HOLLOWAY

Holy God holy holy God

The old man sits down and begins to untie his shoe Leaven

suddenly hugs Quentin Holloway sits down beneath Worth
HOLLOWAY

Are you alright Mister Worth

QUENTIN

Alright

WORTH

I hit my head

HOLLOWAY

Let me take a look at that Its ok Im a doctor it doesnt

look bad

QUENTIN

What the hell are you doing
QUENTIN

Hey old man

The old man Rennes throws his boot into the room An
incinerator quickly burns the boot Rennes pulls the boot
back and then the door closes Rennes drops the boot on the

floor

RENNES

Motiondetectors integrated in the walls Tough to spot

LEAVEN

Oh God oh God oh God

QUENTIN
Wait a second Lets all just relax for a minute

QUENTIN

Alright I attend to agree
LEAVEN

Shouldnt we wait here To see if anybody comes

WORTH

No one is gonna come

QUENTIN

Theres a way in here so theres gotta be a way out We can avoid the

traps using the boot Holloway is it What do you think For an exit

HOLLOWAY

Ok

QUENTIN

It cant be that simple

RENNES
t aint gonna be that simple Take a look around Take a
good long look around see it Coz I got a feeling its

looking at us

LEAVEN

Leaven blinks with her eyes several times Quentin sits down

beneath her

QUENTIN
Leaven we can do this We just have to stay calm and work
together as a team Theres gotta be a lot of people

looking for us on the outside Im a cop alright

LEAVEN

Youre a cop

QUENTIN

Yeah Im gonna get you out of here I promise but you

gotta be with me on this one

LEAVEN

Ok
Rennes opens a new door waiting for Quentin to give signal

QUENTIN

Boot it

Rennes throws the boot nothing happens

RENNES

Clean

Through several times of boot-throwing we see other rooms with
other colors on the walls On the way to a new green room
Leaven notice some numbers in the passage between two rooms A

loud sound is to hear

HOLLOWAY

That one sounded closer

RENNES

Its mechanical Seems to come at regular intervals
QUENTIN

Maybe its the ventilationsystem

RENNES

No bets

HOLLOWAY

No kidding Im boiling

Leaven looks at the numbers again 566 472 737 Above these

numbers are some others 476 804 539

QUENTIN

What is it serial numbers

HOLLOWAY

Room numbers theyre different in each room

WORTH

Oh great so theres only 566 million 400000 rooms in this thing

HOLLOWAY
Thered better not be We have about three days without food and

water before were too weak to move

LEAVEN

They have to feed us dont they

QUENTIN

Holloway

HOLLOWAY

Oh we have heat stress physical exhaustion ie dehydration

headaches dizziness disorientation confusement Mental process

The body eventual begins to break down its own tissue

RENNES

Suck on it Keeps the saliva flowing

Again the boot lands in a new room This time its red
QUENTIN

What

RENNES

The air seems dry in there

HOLLOWAY

Trapped

RENNES

Molecular chemical sensor

QUENTIN

Why the hell didnt the boot set it off

RENNES
The boots not alive It detects hydrogen-sulfide extruded from

the skin

QUENTIN

How come you know so much about sensors Renz

RENNES

RENNES

so far is cause I need your boots If youre not smarting up
Im gone like that No more talking No more guessing Dont
even think about something which is not right in front of ya
Thats the real challenge you gotta save yourselves from

yourselves

Rennes jumps into the new room We hear a click
RENNES

Merde

Rennes gets acid in the face He screams and the door closes

In the other room the door begins to open

QUENTIN

Get him out

Rennes head is partly dissolved He screams quietly because
he has blood in his mouth The others scream too They lay him
in a corner After a little while they look to him again

Hes dead most of his head his been dissolved

QUENTIN
So it was electrochemical or whatever right And he missed it

The Wren Thats great thats fucking great
Quentin turns the corpse of Rennes around with a foot

QUENTIN

Alright Its time to reassess this place

HOLLOWAY
Ive been over it again and again why would they throw

innocent people in here Are we being punished

LEAVEN

Ive never done anything to deserve this

QUENTIN
Forget about all that You cant see the big picture from in
here So dont try Keep your head down Keep it simple

Just look look at whats in front of you

WORTH

Thats what he said

QUENTIN
Start with us We got an escapeartist and a cop
Theres gotta be a reason for that Youre a doctor Holloway

That gives you a function a reason right
HOLLOWAY
No it just makes me go Why me and not one

of the ten million other doctors out there

LEAVEN
There is nothing else My parents are these people

it

thinking

WORTH

One down four to go

QUENTIN

Why dont you tell us what your purpose is Worth

WORTH

Ive wondered that myself Im just a guy I work in an
officebuilding doing officebulding stuff I wasnt
actually bursting joie de vivre before I got here Life

HOLLOWAY

I cant stand that attitude

LEAVEN

Because hes right

QUENTIN

QUENTIN

Kids Three of them I havent made my piece yet

my strength comes from You people find yours wherever you

QUENTIN

Leaven your glasses You dont need them

LEAVEN

QUENTIN
Well they took off her jewelry but they must have put

these on you If nothing is random why are they here

Quentin opens a door in the wall We see three numbers

582 434 865 On the other side theres the numbers 149 413 568
QUENTIN

Leaven what do you read in school Math

HOLLOWAY

LEAVEN

149

Leaven opens a new door The numbers we see are 645 372 xxx

-649

LEAVEN

Primenumbers I cant believe I didnt see it before

QUENTIN

See what
LEAVEN
It seems like if any of these numbers of prime then the room is
trapped Ok 645 645 thats not prime 372 no 649

Wait 11 x 59 its not prime either So that room is safe

QUENTIN
Wait wait wait How can you make that decision based on one

LEAVEN

HOLLOWAY

QUENTIN

Leaven you beautiful brain Boot it
QUENTIN

Ok out of the way

LEAVEN

Brains before beauty

LEAVEN

SAFE Primenumbers Primenumbers Primenumbers Primenumbers

The camera pans around for some time First we see the numbers

656 778 462 then we see Leaven thinking

LEAVEN

How long have we been in here

QUENTIN

Nine or ten hours
HOLLOWAY

How do you know

QUENTIN

5 o clock stubble the last thing I remember was shaving

WORTH

The group crawls into the new room Shortly afterwards they are

in a green room with everyone looking down in a new room

LEAVEN

This one is trapped too

HOLLOWAY

We have to backtrack

QUENTIN

Not yet

LEAVEN

Oh no
Everyone looks up on the door the Quentin looks at Leaven

LEAVEN

Read them to me

Quentin takes of his shirt Leaven is ready to hold it

HOLLOWAY

What are you His coatrack Oh please

Quentin begins to crawls up to the door As he wants to open

the door he says

QUENTIN

Its stuck

As Quentin opens the door a guy falls down and almost hits
Leaven Quentin jumps down and the new guy stands up

KAZAN

This room is green

QUENTIN

Holloway

HOLLOWAY

Hi there

KAZAN
This room is green

HOLLOWAY

Yes it is

KAZAN

I wanna go back to the blue room

QUENTIN

Is it shock or what

HOLLOWAY

I think hes mentally handicapped

KAZAN

I like the blue room

QUENTIN

Jesus Christ

LEAVEN

He almost broke my neck

HOLLOWAY

Hey there are you all alone Do you wanna hold my hand

KAZAN

Butter first then honey Kazan Butter first then honey

LEAVEN

How did he survive

KAZAN

I wanna go back to the blue room

HOLLOWAY
Theres lots of blue rooms Well find another one to you

real soon

LEAVEN

This is just way too bizarre

HOLLOWAY

Will you just worry about your own numbers

HOLLOWAY
Go on Ill look after him

LEAVEN

Safe obviously Since he almost fell on my head

HOLLOWAY

Shall we go for a walk Kazan do you wanna go for a walk

As Quentin begins to crawl up to the door Kazan gets

terrified He hits himself with the one hand on his head

HOLLOWAY

Erm Quentin Lets not make him do the climbing thing right away

QUENTIN

Holloway

KAZAN

Holloway
The screen fades and next time we see something is in a new

room where Kazan opens a new door

HOLLOWAY

Could they have taken us all the way to New Mexico

QUENTIN

What are you talking about Holloway

HOLLOWAY

Im talking about Where do you hide something this big It has at

least got to fill something

HOLLOWAY
Im sorry to shake your foundations Quentin but you have no idea

where your tax-dollars go
QUENTIN

Free clinic doctors

HOLLOWAY
Only the military industrial complex can afford to build something

this size

QUENTIN

Holloway whats the military industrial complex Have you ever been

there Im tellin you its not that complex

HOLLOWAY

And how would you know from where you are

QUENTIN

What do you think these establishments is Its just guys like me
Their

desks are bigger but their jobs arent They dont conspide they
buy boats No

this place is Remember Scaramanga The bad guy in The Man With The
Golden Gun

Its some rich psycos entertainment
HOLLOWAY

Is that what you think

LEAVEN

Clear

HOLLOWAY

Ok youre a cop Single bullet theory Right on

As Holloway lands in the new room she starts to lose her

breath It seems like shes being choken

LEAVEN

Gas

QUENTIN

Holloway Get back here
HOLLOWAY

Its ok I just swallowed my button

LEAVEN

I hate this I hate this

QUENTIN

Your boys having a conniption sitting there

LEAVEN

Its like crÃ©me without coffee

WORTH

She needs a break

QUENTIN

She can do it
Holloway crawls into Kazan and makes him touch her hair And

then back to the other room

WORTH

They dont look prime to me

QUENTIN

Is that your two bits worth Worth

WORTH

Of course its what is worth

QUENTIN

Well

LEAVEN

Well hes right Not prime
LEAVEN

STOP In front of you

A lot of wires or whatever is being shot down from the ceiling
and the slowly surrounds Quentin rotates and Quentin
just jumps away before he gets split up into several pieces

But it wasnt without pain Quentin gets cut on one of his legs

HOLLOWAY

What is it

QUENTIN

SHUT UP

LEAVEN
I dont know what happened it wasnt prime

HOLLOWAY

Quentin hold still

QUENTIN

Somebody stop that rackets

HOLLOWAY

Worth

QUENTIN

Leave the boots

QUENTIN

And shut the fucking door
QUENTIN

I had a feeling about that fucking guy He knew about that trap

LEAVEN

But these numbers arent prime

QUENTIN

Then your numbersystem failed but he knew

HOLLOWAY

Knew what How could he know

QUENTIN
Youre the paranoid think about it His only function so far is

to kick us when were down

HOLLOWAY

So he has a bad attitude So you think that makes him spy

QUENTIN

Trust me on this its my job to read people like an x-ray

The door opens and Worth comes in with Kazan Worth holds him

for his eyes
WORTH

He doesnt like red rooms

Worth makes Kazan sit by himself

WORTH

So what happened

QUENTIN

Pmfh you saw what happened

HOLLOWAY

Quentin

LEAVEN

I guess the numbers are more complicated than I thought

WORTH

Maybe they mean nothing at all

LEAVEN
No it means theyre more involved the works for us up to now have
just

been bad I just need more time with them

HOLLOWAY

We need to rest anyway

QUENTIN

Well thats handy like if there was nothing fucking else we could do

The camera fades Next time we see Leaven writing some numbers on a
piece of metal

HOLLOWAY

Are they telling you anything

LEAVEN

Theyre not Tarot-cards Do you have any idea on how many variables I

have to consider before I can decide from numbers this size They
dont reveal

themselves right away
QUENTIN

Theyre like people

LEAVEN

Oh gross

HOLLOWAY

Erm not here honey over in the corner

HOLLOWAY

Well hes just peeing

QUENTIN

Jesus Christ

LEAVEN
Excellent Now it totally reeks in here

QUENTIN

And you find this all pretty funny dont you

QUENTIN

Whats your fucking problem Worth Even Holloways holding up better
than

you Get over there and help her with him Thats your job
babysitter

WORTH

Jawohl Kommandant

QUENTIN

Somebody has to taka responsibility around here
WORTH

And that somebody has to be you

QUENTIN

Not all of us have a luxury of playing nihilists

WORTH

Not all of us are conceded enough to play hero

QUENTIN

Its the will to live everybodys got it Worth even you especially
you

hiding behind that cynical front

WORTH

The will to live Thats the warm coasy feeling deep inside Thanks

artner Im a new man
Pp

QUENTIN

Arh poor Worth Nobody loves me If thats the chip on your
shoulders

then why did you lug it all this way Why didnt you just lie down and
die
QUENTIN

Do it Show us you have some backbone and jump into the sushimachine
Be

a man

QUENTIN

Thought so

WORTH

Fuck you Quentin I dont wanna die Im just being realistic Do you

think they just builded this thing so we could just walk out of it

QUENTIN

Do you think they would lay clues if there wasnt a way out
WORTH

You think we matter we dont

QUENTIN

Put us out of your misery so we can get on and get out of here

WORTH

Oh youre not getting out

QUENTIN

Yes we are

WORTH

There is no way outta here

QUENTIN

Got ya

HOLLOWAY

How Do you know
QUENTIN

Answer the question Worth

HOLLOWAY

Oh God

QUENTIN

Who are you

WORTH

I am the poison I designed the outer shell

HOLLOWAY

What

WORTH

The shell the sarcophagus

LEAVEN

You builded this thing

WORTH

Not this part the exterior I dont know anything about the numbers
or
anything else in here I was contracted to draw plans for a hollow
shell A cube

LEAVEN

A cube Why didnt you tell us

HOLLOWAY

For Gods sake Worth You knew what it was

WORTH

No

QUENTIN

Worth Youre lying

WORTH

Not first

HOLLOWAY

Whos beyond it

WORTH

I dont know
QUENTIN

Who hired you

WORTH

I didnt ask I never even left my office I talked on the phone to
some

other guys like me Specialists working on small details Nobody knew
what it was

Nobody cared

QUENTIN

Bullshit You knew from square one Look at him hes up to his
eyeballs

in this thing

HOLLOWAY

No Quentin Thats how they stay hidden You keep everyone separated
so

the left hand doesnt know what the right hand is doing The brain
never comes out in

the open
QUENTIN

Whose brain

HOLLOWAY

Its all the same machine right Pentagon Multinational
coorporations

The police If you do one little job You build a widget in Saskatoon
The next thing

you know its two miles under the desert the essential component of
a deathmachine

I was right All along my whole life I knew it I told you Quentin
Nobodys ever

call me paranoid again We gotta get out of here and blow the lid of
this thing

WORTH

Holloway you dont get it

HOLLOWAY

Then tell me please I need to know

WORTH

Its maybe hard for you to understand but theres no conspiracy
Nobody
is in charge Its a headless blunder operating under the illusion of
a masterplan

Can you grasp that Big brother is not watching you

QUENTIN

What kind of fucking explanation is that

WORTH

Its the best youâ€™re gonna get I looked and the only explanation I
can

come to is that there is nobody up there

QUENTIN

Somebody had to say yes to this thing

WORTH

What thing Only we know what it is

QUENTIN

We have no idea what it is

WORTH

We know more than anybody else I mean somebody might have known
sometime before they got fired or voted out or sold it But if this
place ever had a

purpose then it got miscommunicated or lost in the shuffle This is
an accident a

forgotten propetual public worksproject Do you think anybody wants
to ask

questions All they want is a clear conscience and a fat paycheck I
mean I lead on

my desk for months This was a great job

QUENTIN

Why put people in it

WORTH

Because its here you have to use it or admit its pointless

QUENTIN

But it is pointless

WORTH

Quentin Thats my point
HOLLOWAY

What have we come to Its so much worse than I thought

WORTH

Not really just more pathetic

QUENTIN

You make me sick Worth

WORTH

I make me sick too Weâ€™re both part of the system I drew a box - you

walk a beat Its like you said Quentin is Keep your head down keep
it simple just

look at whats in fron of you I mean nobody wants to see the big
picture Lifes too

complicated I mean lets face it The reason were here is its out
of control

HOLLOWAY
Is that how were ruining the world

LEAVEN

Daah Have you been on glue all of your life I felt guilty for
ruining

the world since I was like seven God If you need someone to
blame throw a rock

WORTH

Now I feel better

HOLLOWAY

Thats why you stayed with us To confess

WORTH

Still looking for someone to bust Quentin

HOLLOWAY

Quentin Quentin STOP IT
Leaven grabs Quentins arm

LEAVEN

We need him

QUENTIN

What for

HOLLOWAY

Have you gone absolutely mad Hes the only one who knows nything
about

the place

LEAVEN

Worth

WORTH

Hi
LEAVEN

So theres this outer shell

WORTH

Yeah

LEAVEN

And its a cube like this

WORTH

I assume so

LEAVEN

Are there any doors

WORTH

Theres one door

LEAVEN

Where

WORTH

Wherever the doorguy put it

outside

Six guesses and its sealed from the
LEAVEN

What are the dimensions of the outer shell

WORTH

434 feetsquare

LEAVEN

May I

HOLLOWAY

Come on Side over

LEAVEN

14 by 14 by 14

WORTH

The inner cube cannot be flushed by the shell There is a space

LEAVEN

One cube
WORTH

I dont know It makes sense

LEAVEN

Well the biggest the cube then can be is 26 rooms heigh 26 rooms
across so 17576 rooms

HOLLOWAY

17576 rooms Oh God that makes me queasy

LEAVEN

Descartes

LEAVEN

Leaven you are a genius

QUENTIN

What
We see three numbers 517 478 565

LEAVEN

Cartesian co-ordinates of course coded Cartesian co-ordinates They
are

uses in geometry to plot points on a three-dimensional graph

QUENTIN

In English Slower

LEAVEN

Bonjour these numbers are markers a grid-referance like altitude
and

longitude on a map The numbers tell us where we are inside the cube

QUENTIN

Then where are we

LEAVEN

It works Ok all I have to do now is add the numbers together The X
co-ordinate is 19 Y is 26 rooms So that places us seven rooms
from the edge

QUENTIN

Alright lets go

WORTH

Just out of curuiosity I mean dont hit me again or anything But
what

are you gonna do when you get there

QUENTIN

Maybe we can get the door open

WORTH

Wrong

HOLLOWAY

What we need to do is figure out how we get around the traps

QUENTIN

Im dealing with that Holloway Im looking for practical solutions
here

HOLLOWAY
Well you havent found any yet

QUENTIN

We cut the risk with the numbers and the boot Worth will go in first

HOLLOWAY

No he wont Quentin we take turns

QUENTIN

Relax

The camera fades The first we see is someone nervous playing with
hishers button

QUENTIN

Is there room for two in there

QIENTIN

Whats the matter
LEAVEN

These co-ordinates 14 27 14

QUENTIN

What about them

LEAVEN

Well they dont make sense Assuming the cube is 26 rooms across
there

cant be a co-ordinate larger than 26 If that was right then we
would be outside

the cube

Leaven looks up and looks around

LEAVEN

No not outside the cube

QUENTIN

I guess that means were not having dinner
The camera fades First we see the group opening the door in the
floor

KAZAN

Trap trap trap TRAP

We see a blue room Just after Kazan says trap the last time A lot of
spears come

out from the walls until the room is filled with spears In the end
the spears go

back again

KAZAN

TRAP

The spears come again and goes away in the end

QUENTIN
(Whispers) Its soundactivated BOOOH

The spears come and goes away They close the door

QUENTIN

Lovely

LEAVEN

How come the sound of the door-opening didnt set it off

QUENTIN

Must be reat to ignore it

HOLLOWAY

So thats it The edge is surrounded by traps

LEAVEN

Well I guess we have to backtrack and try somewhere else

QUENTIN

Who knows how many detours well have to take I say we cross the
bitch
HOLLOWAY

Right

QUENTIN

How many boots do we have left Holloway

They look at Kazans feet Just one boot left

QUENTIN

Get it off him We know how it works we just have to be quiet

WORTH

Pretty fucking quiet

QUENTIN

Im glad youre on sight Worth because youre up

QUENTIN

And hes not coming
HOLLOWAY

Of course he is

QUENTIN

No way

HOLLOWAY

Youre not leaving him behind

QUENTIN

Hes unpredictable When we get to the edge we can come back for him
but

he will get somebody killed here Am I right

HOLLOWAY

Shame on you Will you look at yourselves What have you turned into

They may have taken our lives away but were still human beings
Thats all weve

got left

LEAVEN

Well come back for him
HOLLOWAY

Thats a lie and you know it

WORTH

Hell be quiet

Quentin opens the door and puts Worth down there He hangs in the
ceiling by himself

now with a boot in his mouth He crawls down the wall Meanwhile we
hear something

nearby As its no longer is to hear Worth opens a door nothing
happens and crawls

in Leaven is up next Afterwards Holloway Next is Kazan As Leaven
is in Worth and

Holloway stands on the floor Kazan crawls in the ceiling and
afterwards he crawls

the wrong way Holloway goes to get him Suddenly his pants are stuck
in the handle

on the floor Holloway tries to unloose it Next up is Quentin Now
all is in except
Quentin He is on his way In the floor the door is opening So
Quentin hurries up

and arent safe as the handle stops turning He waits to be speared
Nothing happens

Now we hear a gigantic echo

QUENTIN

Third time Holloway tries to swing over to the shell theres a big

rope as Holloway

is falling The others graps Quentins feet as he is almost out fo the
room too

HOLLOWAY

KAZAN

WORTH

Sssh Come on Kazan Kazan will you please stop doing that

QUENTIN

Leaven you gotta be strong sweetheart

LEAVEN

Dont even talk to me

QUENTIN

We gotta get down to the bottom Itll be easier to get on to shell
from
there Its a long fucking way with only one boot But we gotta do it
before we get

too weak You gotta keep cracking the numbers Leaven

LEAVEN

I cant think anymore

QUENTIN

Sure you can Its your gift

LEAVEN

Its not a gift its just a brain

WORTH

Let her sleep for a while We havent slept for fucking hours

QUENTIN

Ok one hour

WORTH

How the fuck are you gonna know how long an hour is

QUENTIN
An hour is as long as I say

The group go to sleep In the background weird music is to hear After
a little

while we see someone taking the boot away from Worth Then we see a
hand holding

Leaven for the mouth Then Quentin is bending towards Leaven and
afterwards we see

him carry Leaven The next we see is a door closing

LEAVEN

What are you doing

QUENTIN

We have to make it down to the bottom Therell be quiet there and you

can concentrate

LEAVEN

Do you just wanna leave them
QUENTIN

Theyre traps We are the key I get us down there You think us out

Believe in me Try to see what I see how my mind works THRASH When
I look into

someones head like a fucking x-ray I looked through the walls I
dreamed him at his

desk designing everything He cant let you solve the puzzle There
is a purpose We

are the purpose The cube is us

LEAVEN

Quentin

QUENTIN

We fit like numbers A man and a woman Two halves of the equation I

take you down The perfect key
QUENTIN

Ill slip you on the lock

QUENTIN

Leaven Its time to go down

Quentin tries to catch her Meanwhile a door is being opened Worth
comes jumping

hitting Quentin to the floor Kazan enters the room too The door
closes

QUENTIN

Get away from her Leaven theyre fucking spys Him the retard
Holloway had outside information about my family She went too far

LEAVEN

You dropped her

WORTH

Just go Quentin

LEAVEN

Give us the boot you pig

Quentin turns around and suddenly hits Worth with the boot Then he
walks towards

QUENTIN

You dont want the boot

Then Quentin again hits Worth several times Afterwards he opens the
door in the

floor
QUENTIN

You wanna come with us Worth Down the hatch

Quentin throws Worth down the hole in the floor As Worth hits the
floor he starts

laughing

QUENTIN

What the fucks with him

The others crawl down to Worth He lies on the door on the handle As
the camera

switches angle we see a corpse with the face down Quentin turns the
corpse with his

foot Its Rennes Quentin drops the boot

QUENTIN
How does he

WORTH

(laughing) Its The Wren the old Renster

QUENTIN

How could

WORTH

(laughing) Weve been going in circles

QUENTIN

That cant be

QUENTIN

Where are we

LEAVEN

I dont know

QUENTIN
Where are we

LEAVEN

You figure it out You havent done anything All you do is freak out

YOU MURDERER

QUENTIN

You were right Worth There is no outta here

QUENTIN

(crying) Get away from me
WORTH

Wasnt Rennes killed in that room

Worth opens the door to were Rennes was killed Theres nothing All
we see is black

Its the edge the shell

WORTH

How come theres nothing out there

QUENTIN

You see an edge

WORTH

We were not at the edge before Wheres the room that killed Rennes

QUENTIN

Fuck off

Quentin throws the boot after Worth but the boot does not him its
being thrown out
of the room

WORTH

Oh that was good

QUENTIN

What difference does it make Were dead anyways

WORTH

HEY Listen to what Im saying There was a room there before We
havent

been moving in circles the rooms have

LEAVEN

Of course

QUENTIN

The rooms

WORTH

That explains the thunder the shaking Weve been shifting the whole

time
LEAVEN

Its the only logical explanation Im such an idiot

WORTH

What are you on to Leaven

LEAVEN

Give me a minute The numbers are markers point on a map right

WORTH

Right

LEAVEN

And how do you map a point that keeps moving

WORTH

Permutations

QUENTIN

Permu what
LEAVEN

Permutations A list of all the co-ordinates the room passes through

Like a map that that tells you where the room starts how many times

it moves and

where it moves to

QUENTIN

The numbers tell you all that

LEAVEN

I dont know Ive only been looking at one point on the map which is

probably the startingposition All I saw
before it

started to move

QUENTIN

Ok so its moving How do we get out

LEAVEN

27 I know where the exit is

was how the cube looked like
QUENTIN

Where

LEAVEN

Stay away from me

WORTH

Back off Quentin

QUENTIN

I just wanna know dont you wanna know

LEAVEN

You remember that room we passed through before the one with the

co-ordinate larger than 26

WORTH

What about it

LEAVEN

That co-ordinate placed the room outside the cube

WORTH

A bridge
LEAVEN

Right but only in its original position

QUENTIN

What are you talking about

LEAVEN

Look the room starts off as a bridge then it moves its way through
the

maze which is where we ran into it but at some point it must return
to its

original position

WORTH

So the bridge is just a bridge

LEAVEN

in a short period of time This thing is like a giant

combinationlock when the rooms are in their startingposition ht elock
is open But

when they move out of the linement the lock closes
WORTH

Well the size of us It must take days to complete a full cycle

QUENTIN

So when does it open

LEAVEN

Dont We find its original co-ordinates by adding the numbers the

permutations is found by subtracting the numbers Its it The room
moves to 0 1 and

-l on the x-axis 2 5 and -7 on y and 1 -1 and 0 on z

QUENTIN

And what does that mean

LEAVEN

You suck in math Ok I need the roomnumbers around as a
referencepoint
WORTH

666 897 466

QUENTIN

567 898 ok

LEAVEN

Yes

QUENTIN

And 545 Did you get that

WORTH

656 778 462

LEAVEN

Thats enough X is 17 y is 25 and z is 14 Which means this room
makes

two more moves before returning to its original position

WORTH

Do we have time

LEAVEN
Maybe

QUENTIN

Then lets go

WORTH

Can you work out the traps in the system

QUENTIN

Fuck the traps lets get to the bridge

WORTH

Well you threw out our last boot you fucking idiot

LEAVEN

Technically I can identify the traps

WORTH

Technically

LEAVEN

First I thought they were identified by primenumbers but theyre not

Theyre identified by a number that are the power of a prime
QUENTIN

Ok so

WORTH

Can you calculate that

LEAVEN

The numbers are huge

QUENTIN

But you can right You can

LEAVEN

I have to calculate to numbers of factors in each set Maybe if I had
a

computer

QUENTIN

You dont need a computer

LEAVEN

Yes I do

QUENTIN
Figure it out

LEAVEN

Yes I do

QUENTIN

Im not dying in a fucking ratmaze

LEAVEN

Look No one in the whole world could do it mentally Look at the

number

567898545 Theres no way I can factor that

567 Its

astronomical

KAZAN

Two Astronomical

WORTH

What did you say

KAZAN

Hes giving us the factors

KAZAN

Astronomical

QUENTIN

Youre telling me Tell-A-Son boy is a genius

LEAVEN

By those numbers the room should be safe

QUENTIN

Theres only one way to find out
LEAVEN

Dont

WORTH

Safe

QUENTIN

Kazan my man

QUENTIN

Whats the numbers boy Right here Look here Make him do it

LEAVEN

Kazan we gonna do some numbers ok We like to do numbers right

LEAVEN

We see Kazan in a red room Hes terrified Then we see Worth entering

Then we see

Worth in the ceiling of the red room with Kazan

WORTH

Kazan opens the door Meanwhile the room starts to move As Kazan is
outside the

room Quentin grabs his t-shirt As he is just halfway out he cant
move anymore

Worth holds Quentins leg Quentin gets split up in two parts
Afterwards we see the

room move Theres blood on the inner cube In the room again we see
Worth crawl

towards Leaven Halfway he stops moving he dies The last we see of
the movie is

Kazan looking at the inner cube before he turns around and disappears
into the

bright white light
