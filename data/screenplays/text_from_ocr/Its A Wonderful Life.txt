to our dear friend Peter Bailey

POTTER
Mr Chairman Id like to get to my
real purpose

MAN
Wait just a minute now

POTTER
Wait for what I claim this
institution is not necessary to this
town Therefore Mr Chairman I
make a motion to dissolve this
institution and turn its assets and
liabilities over to the receiver

UNCLE BILLY
(angrily)
George you hear what that buzzard

LAWYER
Mr Chairman its too soon after
Peter Baileys death to discuss
chloroforming the Building and Loan

MAN
Peter Bailey died three months ago
I second Mr Potters motion

DR CAMPBELL
Very well In that case Ill ask the
two executive officers to withdraw

Dr Campbell rises from his seat George and Uncle Billy
start to collect their papers and leave the table

DR CAMPBELL
But before you go Im sure the whole
board wishes to express its deep
sorrow at the passing of Peter Bailey

GEORGE
Thank you very much

DR CAMPBELL
It was his faith and devotion that
are responsible for this organization

POTTER
Ill go further than that Ill say
that to the public Peter Bailey was
the Building and Loan

Everyone looks at him surprised

UNCLE BILLY
(trying to control
himself)
Oh thats fine Potter coming from
you considering that you probably
drove him to his grave

POTTER

Peter Bailey was not a business man
Thats what killed him Oh I dont
mean any disrespect to him God rest
his soul He was a man of high
ideals so-called but ideals without
common sense can ruin this town

(picking up papers

from table)
Now you take this loan here to Ernie
Bishop You know that fellow that
sits around all day on his brains in
his taxi You know I happen to
know the bank turned down this loan
but he comes here and were building
him a house worth five thousand
dollars Why

George is at the door of the office holding his coat and
papers ready to leave

GEORGE
Well I handled that Mr Potter
You have all the papers there His
salary insurance I can personally
vouch for his character

POTTER
(sarcastically)
A friend of yours

GEORGE
Yes sir

POTTER
You see if you shoot pool with some
employee here you can come and borrow
money What does that get us A
discontented lazy rabble instead of
a thrifty working class And all
because a few starry-eyed dreamers
like Peter Bailey stir them up and
fill their heads with a lot of
impossible ideas Now I say

George puts down his coat and comes around to the table
incensed by what Potter is saying about his father

GEORGE
Just a minute - just a minute Now
hold on Mr Potter Youre right
when you say my father was no business
I know that Why he ever started
his cheap penny-ante Building and
oan Ill never know But neither
ou nor anybody else can say anything
gainst his character because his
hole life was Why in the twenty-
ive years since he and Uncle Billy
tarted this thing he never once
hought of himself Isnt that right
Uncle Billy He didnt save enough
money to send Harry to school let
alone me But he did help a few people
get out of your slums Mr Potter
And whats wrong with that Why
Here youre all businessmen here
Doesnt it make them better citizens
Doesnt it make them better customers
You you said Whatd you say
just a minute ago They had to
wait and save their money before
they even ought to think of a decent
home Wait Wait for what Until
their children grow up and leave
them Until theyre so old and broken-
down that they Do you know how
long it takes a working man to save
five thousand dollars Just remember

POTTER

(laughs)
George now thats just what I like
so much about you

(pleasantly and

smoothly)
George Im an old man and most
people hate me But I dont like
them either so that makes it all
even You know just as well as I do
that I run practically everything in
this town but the Bailey Building
and Loan You know also that for a
number of years Ive been trying to
get control of it or kill it But
I havent been able to do it You
have been stopping me In fact you
have beaten me George and as anyone
in this county can tell you that
takes some doing Take during the
depression for instance You and I
were the only ones that kept our
heads You saved the Building and
Loan and I saved all the rest

GEORGE
Yes Well most people say you stole
all the rest

POTTER
The envious ones say that George
the suckers Now I have stated my
side very frankly Now lets look
at your side Young man twenty-

seven twenty-eight married
making say forty a week
GEORGE
(indignantly)

Forty-five

POTTER

Forty-five Forty-five Out of which
after supporting your mother and
paying your bills youre able to
keep say ten if you skimp A child
or two comes along and you wont
even be able to save the ten Now

if this young man of twenty-eight
was a common ordinary yokel Id
say he was doing fine But George
Bailey is not a common ordinary
yokel Hes an intelligent smart
ambitious young man — who hates his
job - who hates the Building and
Loan almost as much as I do A young
man whos been dying to get out on
his own ever since he was born A
young man the smartest one of the
crowd mind you a young man who has
to sit by and watch his friends go
places because hes trapped Yes
sir trapped into frittering his
life away playing nursemaid to a lot
of garlic-eaters Do I paint a
correct picture or do I exaggerate

Potters hand feels like a cold mackerel to him In that

moment of p

hysical contact he knows he could never be

associated with this man George drops his hand with a

shudder He

peers intently into Potters face

More people come in The place becomes a bedlam Shouts of
Gangway - gangway as a new bunch comes in and pours out

stands there overcome and speechless as he holds Zuzu As he
sees the familiar faces he gives them sick grins Tears
course down his face His lips frame their names as he greets
them

breaking point)

As various members of the family bring out a punch bowl and
glasses Janie sits down at the piano and strikes a chord

She starts playing Hark The Herald Angels Sing and the
entire crowd joins in the singing We see a SERIES OF SHOTS
of the various groups singing the hymn and some people are
still coming in and dropping their money on the table Carter
the bank examiner makes a donation the sheriff sheepishly
looks at George and tears his warrant in small pieces In

the midst of this scene Harry in Naval uniform enters
accompanied by Bert the cop

Once more the crowd breaks into cheering and applause Janie
at the piano and Bert on his accordion start playing Auld
Lang syne and everyone joins in

CLOSE SHOT

George still holding Zuzu in his arms glances down at the
pile of money on the table His eye catches something on top
of the pile and he reaches down for it It is Clarences

copy of Tom Sawyer George opens it and finds an inscription
written in it Dear George remember no man is a failure

who has friends Thanks for the wings Love Clarence

MARY
(looking at book
Whats that

GEORGE
Thats a Christmas present froma
very dear friend of mine

At this moment perhaps because of the jostling of some of
the people on the other side of the tree a little silver
bell on the Christmas tree swings to and fro with a silvery
tinkle Zuzu closes the cover of the book and points to the
bell

ZUZU
Look Daddy Teacher says every
time a bell rings an angel gets his
wings

GEORGE
(smiling)
Thats right thats right

He looks up toward the ceiling and winks

GEORGE
Attaboy Clarence

The voices of the people singing swell into a final crescendo
for the

FADE OUT

THE END
