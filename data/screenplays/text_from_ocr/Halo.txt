HALO
A series of scorched snapshots
Fragments As memory

This is MASTER CHIEFS DREAM

OPEN ON a SPARTAN HELMET and a REFLECTION in its visor

In the reflection we see buildings The design and
architecture of the buildings tell us this is the distant
future

And twin suns tell us this is not Earth The suns are low in
the sky and bathing the landscape blood red

SNAP BACK to show the full figure of the SPARTAN

Seven foot tall clad head-to-toe in MJOLNIR armor holding
an MASB ASSAULT RIFLE - MASTER CHIEF

SNAP BACK AGAIN to reveal behind MASTER CHIEF another fifty
SPARTAN WARRIORS

All the SPARTANS have their gaze directed at the skies

where a vast shadow or cloud is eclipsing the twin suns

A shadow which resolves itself into literally thousands of
COVENANT DROP-SHIPS

cut TO -
A BATTLEFIELD

The buildings are now destroyed Skeletal steel frames push
from rubble providing only a suggestion of the structures
that once stood Across this wasteland the SPARTANS and the
COVENANT are locked in ferocious combat

The SPARTANS are super-warriors Combat machines - except
that beneath their armor is genetically-refined human flesh
and blood

Despite their physical size they are fast As we watch them
TURN-AIM-FIRE the speed of their reactions is unnatural
They seem fuelled by nitrous oxide and amphetamines
And there is something HYPNOTIC about the way they fight
Amidst the chaos there are patterns Across the
battlefield we can see PRECISE MOVEMENTS echoed from SPARTAN
to SPARTAN The same motion in the way a weapon is raised
the leap and roll to avoid an explosion

The impression is of method within the madness of no-holds
barred combat The SPARTAN warrior training is embedded deep
within them Almost coded

The COVENANT provide a contrast Among the various species
that make up the alien ranks we can see the tall and regal
ELITES the massive HUNTERS the gorilla-sized GRUNTS the
thin and feral JACKALS

And they all fight with their own brand of specialized ULTRA-
VIOLENCE Less controlled than their human enemy they are
zealots rabid They roar as they charge plasma blazing
from their weaponry In close quarters they tear and rip
and claw

Many more of the alien warriors are falling and dying But
they can afford it In comparison to the SPARTANS the
COVENANT are far far greater in number

As we watch the scene unfold something becomes clear The
tide of the battle is turning inexorably against the humans

cur TO -

MASTER CHIEF maintaining a barrage of fire as the SPARTANS to
the left and right of him are lacerated by plasma fire

cur TO

A SPARTAN as a plasma grenade sticks to his chest He
doubles up to protect his brothers - then flies apart as the
grenade explodes

curt To -

Another SPARTAN walking dazed blackened blood-smeared
half his armor blown from his body half his arm hanging
useless at his side

cuT TO -

A group of THREE SPARTANS driving a WARTHOG VEHICLE - one
driving one on shotgun one on the rear canon - as they
break ranks to CHARGE the enemy

then skid roll and die under a rain of fire
Here and throughout the combat feels real Hard bloody
and brutal

The city burning

cuUT TO -

The twin suns blazing

A black screen and sudden silence Over this a caption
appears
CAPTION
Year 2552 A coalition of alien

species the Covenant are waging a
genocidal holy war against mankind

The caption fades to be replaced by

CAPTION
Mankind is losing

Then FADE UP TO -

EXT OUTER SPACE

A constellation of stars thickening into a belt of Milky
Way

In the foreground is curve of a gas-giant PLANET

And orbiting the planet there is what appears to be a vast
metal ring the circumference of a small moon rotating

slowly
Its beautiful and peaceful Poised in space

Even from this distance we can just make out a strange
feature of the metallic band

The interior is a wrap-around landscape made up of the same
foliage-greens water-blues and dust-yellows we know from

views of our own planet It is as if someone has cut a strip
from Earth and lined the inside of this artificial world

TITLE HALO
A moment later the tranquility is broken
- by a flickering burst of light a rip in space

Out of the fissure a human-built battle-cruiser appears

EXT PILLAR OF AUTUMN

Hulking grey massive - a great block of a space-ship as
solid as a concrete bomb-shelter designed purely for war

On the side of the battle-cruiser is its name PILLAR OF
AUTUMN

And on the underside of its snub nose a portal behind which
is the bridge

where a man stands gazing out The commander of this
vessel CAPTAIN KEYES

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMNBRIDGE

CAPTAIN KEYES looks out at the planet and its ring-moon
Behind him the bridge crew are at their ‘posts Manning the
flight decks

A moment as CAPTAIN KEYES surveys this scene

Then

CAPTAIN KEYES

Cortana

None of the bridge crew respond Instead he is replied by a
female voice - the voice of the Pillar Of Autumns AI

CORTANA
Yes sir

CAPTAIN KEYES
Two questions Where the Hell are
we and did we lose them

CORTANA
We made a blind jump sir Im
scanning the constellations now to
get a fix on our position
(beat)
As for whether we lost them
CAPTAIN KEYES
Don’t bother TI can see the answer
for myself

THROUGH THE BRIDGE PORTAL we can see multiple SLIP-SPACE
fissures similar to the one from which Pillar of Autumn
appeared

And through each fissure COVENANT CAPITAL SHIPS are
appearing

The face of CAPTAIN KEYES is stone Unreadable

CORTANA
Sir - at least we’ve drawn them
away from Earth

CAPTAIN KEYES
How long until they’re all over us

CORTANA
Ninety seconds

CAPTAIN KEYES
Then time is on our side Combat
alert alpha

CORTANA
Copy sir I’m already on it

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMNLOWER DECK
An alert sounds throughout the ship

CORTANA
(over ship-wide intercom)
All hands to combat posts All
hands to combat posts Prepare to
repel boarders

On the lower deck ENGINEERS and MEDICS scramble to position
MARINES grab hardware from weapon racks pulling on helmets
and flak jackets

In the middle of the commotion one group of soldiers stand
as a contrast to the adrenaline and commotion An oasis of
calm This is MAJOR SILVA and his men the HELLJUMPERS - the
special-forces unit stationed on the Pillar of Autumn

But closing in on MAJOR SILVA his calm exterior seems
suddenly misleading There’s something burning behind his
eyes Something not quite sane
MAJOR SILVA
Helljumpers You heard it
There’s a shit storm coming

HELLJUMPERS
(shout as one)
Sir yes SIR
MAJOR SILVA regards them a couple of beats Then smiles

MAJOR SILVA
Let’s spill blood

EXT PILLAR OF AUTUMN

From the Pillar Of Autumn fighter craft spill from the
flight bays to intercept the incoming Covenant craft

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMNBRIDGE

CAPTAIN KEYES looks out as the stream of tiny fighter craft
dwarfed in both size and number by the approaching enemy
vessels The first of them are already being engaged by
Covenant fighters

The battle has begun But CAPTAIN KEYES is looking beyond
it to HALO

CAPTAIN KEYES
Cortana - what is that structure
ahead

CORTANA
Unknown Artificial

CAPTAIN KEYES
A space-station

CORTANA
Negative

CAPTAIN KEYES
Covenant

CORTANA
Negative based on current database
of Covenant structures
(puzzled beat)
And there’s something strange
It’s nitrogen and oxygen-rich
Life supporting
(MORE )
Some

CORTANA (contd)
And it was obviously built by
someone
(processing beat)
But no sentient life-forms appear
on scan

KEYES nods
CAPTAIN KEYES
Oxygen-rich is all I need to know
Get us close I want to be within
lifeboat range

CORTANA
On approach vector now

CAPTAIN KEYES
And Cortana

CORTANA
Sir

CAPTAIN KEYES
It’s time we woke our war-dog

MASTER CHIEFS DREAM
We are back under the blood-red twin suns
This is CLOSE QUARTERS COMBAT with the COVENANT

And MASTER CHIEF seems to be alone in this fight The last
of the SPARTANS

He fires into the faces and chests of the Covenant troops at
near point-blank range He is completely surrounded by the
aliens Beneath his feet is what appears a tangled carpet of
bodies

Then the image starts to bleach

To WHITE OUT

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMNCRYO-STORAGE CHAMBER

From the WHITE OUT an image resolves

It is as seen from MASTER CHIEFS POV from the inside of a
CRYO STORAGE CHAMBER looking out
“era

nd

And looking in the somewhat fearful faces of two CRYO
ENGINEERS

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMNCRYO-STORAGE HOLD

CRYO ENGINEER
Holy Christ Would you look at the
size of it

SUPPORT ENGINEER
Him There’s a man in there

The SUPPORT ENGINEER is checking the life-systems monitor

SUPPORT ENGINEER
Low-level systems reading positive
Higher systems coming online
(final check)
Blood is hot He’s good to go

The door to the CRYO-STORAGE CHAMBER cracks its seal then
rises open

The two men wait for the huge SPARTAN to show a sign of life

CRYO ENGINEER
(whispers to Support
Engineer )

So what do we call ‘him’

SUPPORT ENGINEER
Sir

CRYO ENGINEER
Uh sir Are you awake

MASTER CHIEF stirs
A beat

Then SUDDENLY the SPARTAN lunges forwards reflexively
snapped into consciousness

Equally reflexively the two ENGINEERS jump back

MASTER CHIEF reaches out to place a hand either side of the
Cryo-Chamber then steps out

A moment as he surveys his surroundings Looking to the
left then the right Then down at the two men

He towers over them and they seem to shrink under the blank
gaze of his visor as he speaks his first words

MASTER CHIEF
What are my orders

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMN

MASTER CHIEF is moving fast through the Pillar of Autumn As
he runs the entire ship is vibrating and shaking from the
Covenant attack

Ahead an explosion rips through heavy blast doors tearing
them open On the other side of the blast doors a furnace-
like fire is raging

CORTANA
(over ship-wide intercom)
Imminent breach in sectors seven
and twelve All available combat
and medical units move to secure

MASTER CHIEF ducks through an ACCESS TUNNEL emerging back
into a ROUTE CORRIDOR

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMNROUTE CORRIDOR

- where a handful of MARINES are crouched behind a
makeshift barricade in an intense fire fight

CORTANA
(over ship-wide intercom)
Breach in sectors eight nine and
twelve

On the other side of the barricade at the far end of the
ROUTE CORRIDOR we get our first glimpse of the alien
COVENANT race

But through the smoke and plasma fire a glimpse is all it is
- shadow figures of various sizes advancing

Several of the Marines are already down

One is wounded - screaming sliding himself backwards along
the floor leaving a thick wet smear of red Two others lie

dead

From the weight of incoming plasma it is clear the Marines’
position is going to be overwhelmed
il

A SERGEANT blocks MASTER CHIEF’S way

SERGEANT
Sir We need your assistance here

MASTER CHIEF turns assessing the situation Then he takes
the SERGEANT’S ASSAULT RIFLE and two GRENADES from the
SERGEANTS belt clip

and steps up to the barricade

Beneath him a MARINE CORPORAL crouches holding an M6D
PISTOL in his hand The CORPORAL’S name-tag reads JENKINS

JENKINS looks up at MASTER CHIEF who stands almost
motionless back to the barricade ASSAULT RIFLE lowered
As if he is listening

Then the Spartan moves out from cover
Fast Fluid
He tosses both grenades

As they bounce down to the far end of the corridor he raises
the assault rifle

Four bursts empty the clip He’s firing only at shadows
targets we can hardly see

As soon as the clip empties almost as if timed there is the
double detonation of the two grenades

Smoke and silence
Then from smoke a GRUNT appears

The foot-soldier of the Covenant army Normally - stocky
broad powerful

But this one is dazed And badly wounded Blue blood is
splashing from his torso

MASTER CHIEF reaches down and takes the CORPORAL’S M6D
PISTOL

He glances at the handgun - and sees that the Corporal has
customized it Carved into the metal are the words NOTHING
PERSONAL

MASTER CHIEFS fist closes around the grip Then he raises
the pistol and uses it to put a single round through the
head of the wounded GRUNT
Nee

Nee

12

As the GRUNT drops MASTER CHIEF offers the pistol back
But the CORPORAL shakes his head

CORPORAL JENKINS
(awestruck)
Keep it

MASTER CHIEF nods

From this point on this M6éD is always MASTER CHIEFS
handgun

Then the Spartan turns to the SERGEANT and tosses the
assault rifle to him

MASTER CHIEF
More will come Take your wounded
and fall back to a new position
Now

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMNBRIDGE

Commotion on the bridge as the FLIGHT DECK CREW desperately
try to keep abreast of the collapsing ship systems

FLIGHT DECK CREWMAN
Primary thrust engines off-line
Massive pressure loss on four port-
side decks six-through-nine

Only CAPTAIN KEYES and the voice of CORTANA register a tone
of objective calm

CORTANA
Theyre using our lifeboat airlocks
to attach their boarding craft

CAPTAIN KEYES
Blocking cur way out as they make
their way in Smart bastards

FLIGHT DECK CREWMAN
Sir Weve lost main canon

At this moment MASTER CHIEF enters The Spartan is so tall
that he has to duck to pass through the bridge entrance

MASTER CHIEF approaches CAPTAIN KEYES and salutes

MASTER CHIEF
Reporting as ordered sir
“igre

CAPTAIN KEYES
Good to see you Master Chief Let
me get you up to speed we’re in
the shit

MASTER CHIEF simply nods

CAPTAIN KEYES
So here’s what going to happen
Youre going to get Cortana off
this ship and keep her safe from
the enemy

CORTANA
(cutting in)
Uh - six

CAPTAIN KEYES
The Pillar of Autumn is going down
And youre not going down with it

CORTANA
But you are

CAPTAIN KEYES
I‘m going to keep a skeleton crew
and land on the object we’ve found
But destruction or capture of the
shipboard AI is not an option

CORTANA
Sir as a tactical point your best
bet to land this ship is me

CAPTAIN KEYES
(cutting in hard)

As a tactical point Cortana if
the Covenant capture you they’ll
learn everything Force
deployment system schematics
weapons research Not to mention
the location of planet Earth Now
are you going to make me invoke an
override command or just do as
you’re told

CORTANA’S answer is preempted by a detonation that rocks the
bridge Wherever the explosion was it feels close

CORTANA
Preparing for a hard transfer sir
“essa

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMNLOWER DECK

MAJOR SILVA and the HELLJUMPERS are locked in their own
savage fire-fight - hunched behind cover keeping up a steady
barrage of suppression fire

The way they fight is qualitatively different from the
MARINES There is no sense of panic in the combat No
screaming as they take a hit Wo scrabbling for a reload

CAPTAIN KEYES
(over ship-wide intercom)
All units this is your Captain
speaking I’m giving the order to
abandon ship Repeat abandon
ship

MAJOR SILVA
God damn

CAPTAIN KEYES
(over ship-wide intercom)
Take lifeboats drop-ships any
means of escape available Regroup
on the ring We’re taking the
fight planet-side

MAJOR SILVA stands apparently oblivious to the plasma fire
that now flies around him - and yells at his Special Forces
troops

MAJOR SILVA
You heard the man Solid ground -
just how we like it

HELLJUMPERS
Sir yes sir

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMNBRIDGE

MASTER CHIEF stands with CAPTAIN KEYES

who uses his fingerprint to unlock and open a section of
the central bridge console

Inside is a rectangular object slim as a CD case the size
of credit card Almost translucent it glows softly
Delicate light strands flicker like blood moving through
capillaries The microcircuitry itself seems to shift like
an X-ray of bones behind skin

CAPTAIN KEYES
Look after her

MASTER CHIEF takes the CORTANA CHIP and inserts it intoa
dock in his MJOLNIR armor - positioned in the back of his
neck the brain stem

As the chip connects his entire suit pulses with a single
crackle of energy as if recharging following a hit

MASTER CHIEF
Yes sir

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMNROUTE TO LIFEBOATS

MASTER CHIEF moves again through the Pillar of Autumn

He is armed now with an MA5B assault rifle making his way
down a narrow SERVICE TUNNEL dimly lit lined with cabling

Ahead is a main corridor to the LIFE BOATS A bright frame
at the end of the dark tunnel

into which steps a COVENANT SOLDIER

tts an ELITE Tall armored athletic In a sense the
alien equivalent of the SPARTAN

MASTER CHIEF freezes

Perhaps the ELITE will move on again in a moment

-- but it doesn’t

MASTER CHIEF takes a cautious step Then another

It is surprising that the apparently heavy plated armor can
allow for stealth but either through his strength or the

armor’s design MASTER CHIEF moves forwards silently

The ELITE still doesn’t move on but neither does it hear him
coming

Now just inside the door frame between the SERVICE TUNNEL
and the MAIN CORRIDOR

MASTER CHIEF is close enough to reach out and touch the
ELITE

And that’s exactly what he does
oad

Suddenly a cobra strike - a classic game move MASTER CHIEF
strikes with the butt of his assault rifle taking out
ELITE’S shields

and as the ELITE staggers back MASTER CHIEF empties half
a clip into the aliens torso

Thirty rounds fly through the gun in two seconds

As the ELITE drops -

- in a continuous movement MASTER CHIEF steps out into the
MAIN CORRIDOR switching to his M6D HANDGUN

- to confront four Covenant GRUNTS

MASTER CHIEF fires four times in rapid succession Each shot
finds its target One of the Covenant foot-soldiers manages
to get off a round - but only from squeezing his trigger as
an involuntary death-reflex as he falls

Back on the assault rifle MASTER CHIEF turns to check his
six

and the corridor is clear
Immediately MASTER CHIEF reloads

CORTANA
(impressed)
Good work Master Chief I can
tell Im in

At the sound of CORTANA’S voice MASTER CHIEF‘’S head cocks to
the side - puzzled

CORTANA
(trailing off)
safe hands

MASTER CHIEF taps the side of his head as if checking his
hearing

CORTANA
What are you doing

MASTER CHIEF
Are you talking to me

CORTANA
Who else would I be talking to

MASTER CHIEF
Sounds like you’re in my head

CORTANA
Your suit is hardwired into your
neural network and I’m hardwired
into your suit I amin your head
(beat)
Feels kind of empty in here

MASTER CHIEF says nothing Simply sets off again

cut To

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMNCORRIDOR OUTSIDE LIFEBOATS

LOCKED-OFF REVERSE ANGLE on a COVENANT position

An ELITE three JACKALS and four GRUNTS - with their backs to
us as they fire down the smoke and fire-filled corridor

ahead

And suddenly a hail of rounds are coming our way -

- ripping through the Covenant dropping and shredding them
One last surviving GRUNT screaming turns to run towards us -
- and is shot in the back

Falls

As MASTER CHIEF comes through the haze towards us we realize
we have just seen what it is like to be on the receiving end
of a SPARTAN attack

Over his left shoulder the SPARTAN is carrying a wounded
MARINE In his right hand his assault rifle smokes

Three more MARINES follow behind

CORTANA
There‘s only one lifeboat left

MASTER CHIEF
Were on it

INT LIFEBOAT

MASTER CHIEF slides thé WOUNDED MARINE off his shoulder as
another MARINE a female Lieutenant slips into the lifeboat
cockpit

MASTER CHIEF
Punch it

FEMALE MARINE
Yes sir

She hits the LAUNCH button

The door to the LIFEBOAT snap-seals shut - fast as the blink
of an eye with a power that would cut you in two if you were
half-way through the hatch

And a beat later an explosive burst of acceleration rocks
everyone as the LIFEBOAT is jettisoned from the Pillar of
Autumn

FEMALE MARTNE
Were out of here

EXT PILLAR OF AUTUMN

External view as the tiny escape vessel powers away from its
listing mother ship through the swarm of Covenant ships
arcing down to the ring-world below

INT LIFEBOAT

From their seat harnesses the MARINES gaze in wonder over
the shoulder of the FEMALE LIEUTENANT as she pilots the craft
down towards HALO

MARINE
(at the sight)
Holy shit

MARINE
What is that thing Lieutenant

FEMALE LIEUTENANT
Never saw anything like it
Meese

MASTER CHIEF is showing no interest Instead he is kneeling
over the WOUNDED MARINE who is bleeding from the mouth and
has a mess of burned clothing and torn flesh around his
stomach

WOUNDED MARINE
(shaking)
T don’t want to die Oh God Oh
please

The MASTER CHIEF takes the WOUNDED MARINE’S med-kit

Pushing a compress over the soldier’s appalling stomach
wound he jabs him in the neck with a HYPO

MASTER CHIEF
(quiet)
You still in pain soldier

WOUNDED MARINE
(as the synthetic morphine
hits)
No sir No pain

FEMALE MARINE
Heads up everyone This is it
Were hitting the atmosphere in
five

EXT LIFEBOAT
We follow the LIFEBOAT as it enters HALO’S interior curve

With us and around us we can see other LIFEBOATS from the
Pillar of Autumn following the same downward path like a
miniature meteor shower

As we get closer to the landscape we discover jutting out
of rolling hills and countryside strange constructs
Metallic alien designed ancient At first like lost and
abandoned temple-structures

then seeming more like machinery or parts of machinery
Iceberg-like implying a colossal superstructure hidden
beneath the ground level

But aside from the evidence of design and the lush plant-
life there is no sign of life Nothing sentient No
movement or sign of activity

The world seems dead Or frozen in stasis

But above all peaceful

And during this sequence we have been almost lulled
Hypnotised by the unfolding landscape

Which provides a STARK and VIOLENT CONTRAST as we -

CUT BACK TO

INT LIFEBOAT
The tiny vessel is shaking as if it’s going to rip apart
Over the roar of noise the FEMALE MARINE is yelling
FEMALE LIEUTENANT
Air-brake failure Air-brake

failure They blew too early

CORTANA
Chief

MASTER CHIEF
Well be fine

CORTANA
Fine Were not even strapped in

MASTER CHIEF stands within the bucking vessel then reaches
out both arms

and locks a fist around a hand-hold each side of the
craft

FEMALE LIEUTENANT
Were losing her BRACE FOR
IMPACT BRACE BRACE BRA -
She is cut off as the impact comes

No exterior shot - we stay inside the vessel throughout the
duration of the crash-landing on HALO’S surface

And it is savage
First the initial strike

Then the glass of the cockpit portal explodes inwards -
firing lacerating shrapnel into the FEMALE MARINE
ene

Then the craft skews violently sideways and begins to
tumble

Then it is rolling Anything loose is flying around the
cabin

There ig the sense of one final and devastating impact
Then -
SNAP TO A BLACK SCREEN
And -
FADE UP TO

INT LIFEBOAT

The LIFEBOAT lies on its side Blood and smashed bodies tell
us that none of the MARINES survived the crash

MASTER CHIEF himself lies motionless

CORTANA
Chief

His armor flickers - a recharge

CORTANA
Chief Can you hear me

MASTER CHIEF stirs

MASTER CHIEF
I hear you

CORTANA
At last Can you move The
others they didn’t make it

EXT HALOVALLEYLIFEBOAT - DAY

The rear hatch of the LIFEBOAT kicks open and MASTER CHIEF
steps out

There is meadow grass beneath his feet

He is in a valley whose steep sides rise to sheer cathedral-
like rock faces

A river runs along the valley floor then cuts into the
bedrock creating a deep waterfall at the far end

CORTANA
(shock and awe)
Oh
(beat)
Look

MASTER CHIEF looks skywards and sees an EXTRAORDINARY sight

Not just the unnatural way in which either side of their
position the massive interior of HALO curves up in a gradual
incline to rejoin the upper part of the ring a vast distance
above

»» but also the PILLAR OF AUTUMN
The battle cruiser is on its descent
Trailing a colossal white plume of vapor

A sound like innumerable jet-planes Distant yet
overwhelming

Behind the PILLAR OF AUTUMN pursuing it we can see the
shadow shapes of the COVENANT ARMARDA - maintaining a
constant barrage of fire at the stricken vessel

CORTANA
(quiet)
She‘s going down

From MASTER CHIEFS position we track the Pillar of
Autumn

until many miles distant further up the curve seen
through a blue atmosphere haze

she crash-lands on HALO’S surface

Because of the distance the sound is delayed by a few
seconds so the impact takes place in SILENCE

And a few seconds after the sound comes a second shockwave
this one physical - a ripple through the actual surface of
the ring

MASTER CHIEF and CORTANA can SEE it coming before it hits
them - shuddering out from the crash sight racing around the
ring curvature

-- until with a roar of breaking rock and twisting metal
it passes under them

Then is gone

A beat

CORTANA
I felt something

MASTER CHIEF
It’s called an earthquake

CORTANA
No something else

MASTER CHIEF
Like what

CORTANA
T don’t know I

She breaks off

Then - urgent

CORTANA
Warning I’m detecting multiple
Covenant drop-ships inbound

EXT HALOVALLEY SIDE — DAY

From behind a rock-cluster high up the valley side MASTER
CHIEF watches a Covenant DROPSHIP lands by the crashed

Lifeboat

The HUD within his helmet provides a zoom function to enlarge
the image

The helmet is also equipped with DIRECTIONAL AUDIO
amplifying the sound of wherever they are pointed - meaning
we can hear the sound of the Covenant talking in their alien

language

We watch as several ELITES and GRUNTS jump from the DROPSHIP
and head over to the crashed LIFEBOAT to investigate

CORTANA
If we’re lucky the Covenant will
believe that everyone died in the
crash

MASTER CHIEF
It would be useful to know what
they’re saying

CORTANA
No problem I can provide a
translation directly into your
neural web with only a point-two
second delay

A moment later a heavily digitized translation of the alien
language begins

Two ELITES - a BLUE and the higher ranking BLACK discuss
their find

ELITE
Four inside All dead None to
interrogate

BLACK ELITE
Seek more

As they talk the GRUNTS are pulling the bodies of the
MARINES out of the lifeboat

The BLACK ELITE reaches down and lifts one of the dead
MARINES by the head - with only one hand

BLACK ELITE
All this flesh is sacrilege

He lets the MARINE fall

BLACK ELITE
Burn it

Immediately the GRUNTS open fire on the corpses with FULLY
CHARGED PLASMA PISTOLS

MASTER CHIEF reacts by raising his M6D PISTOL and lining up
on the BLACK ELITE through HUD zoom-function

CORTANA
Chief - no The men are dead
Beyond saving - but there will be
others who aren’t

MASTER CHIEF hesitates

CORTANA
I’ve got a lifeboat beacon just two
klicks from here

(MORE )

CORTANA (contd)
If there are survivors they need
our help right now

Slowly MASTER CHIEF lowers his gun

MASTER CHIEF
(growls)
Lead me in

He turns and starts to move

EXT HALOVALLEYLIFEBOAT - DAY

The Covenant are heading back to the DROPSHIP - but not the
BLACK ELITE

He still stands by the LIFEBOAT and the charred remains of
the MARINES surveying the surrounding valley - as if he can
almost sense that one of his enemy has managed to get away

He walks away from the DROPSHIP scanning

Then pauses

At his feet by the riverbank there is a single footprint in
the wet earth

A guttural noise emerges from the back of his throat rising
into a barked order

The Covenant by the DROPSHIP freeze

In Covenant tongue the BLACK ELITE shouts a series of
enraged commands

Moments later from the DROPSHIP’S central suspension-field
three GHOSTS emerge - light-weight scouting vehicles each
piloted by a single ELITE armed with two plasma canons

Hovering a couple of metres off the ground the three GHOSTS

bank in the direction of the BLACK ELITE’S jabbed arm and
accelerate away

EXT HALOSUMMIT RIDGE - DAY

MASTER CHIEF moves fast now on the high ridge pass between
the valley he just left and the next one along

CORTANA
It’s not far By my calculation
we should be able to see them just
over this next
sora

She breaks off

CORTANA
» Do you hear that

MASTER CHIEF stops
Through the wind rush a high electronic whine

MASTER CHIEF
I hear it

He turns just in time to see the first of the three GHOSTS
rising over the crest behind him

The GHOST opens fire - a moment too late to hit its target
MASTER CHIEF is already rolling to the side -

- ending in a crouch assault rifle raised
- and firing

He finds his target He empties a long burst into the
oncoming GHOST and just as he hits the end of the clip -

- the GHOST explodes

But MASTER CHIEF has barely a second in which to register
this Because at the moment the FIRST GHOST explodes

the SECOND GHOST rams him full on

It takes a second or two for MASTER CHIEF to work out what
has happened

Like a pedestrian hit by a car MASTER CHIEF is now riding
the front of the GHOST

He‘s lost his assault rifle in the impact

The ELITE pilot weaves the ghost from side to side in an
attempt to shake MASTER CHIEF off

CORTANA
CHIEF BEHIND You

MASTER CHIEF looks over his shoulder

The GHOST’S pilot can’t see because his view is blocked by
MASTER CHIEF
ead

but MASTER CHIEF can now see they are heading towards a
sheer drop off one of the cathedral rock faces into the
valley below

They are a second or two from launching into thin air

MASTER CHIEF lunges forwards towards the PILOT and grabs at
the GHOST CONTROLS yanking them to the left

the GHOST banks sideways just in time

EXT HALOCLIFF EDGE DAY

Now they are riding along the EDGE of the sheer drop

with MASTER CHIEF now hanging on to the side of the
cockpit trading punches with the ELITE PILOT

One last vicious punch from MASTER CHIEF -

- and the ELITE’S head snaps sideway with a crunch of
breaking neck

But as the PILOT falls sideways in the cockpit he jams into
the control stick

The GHOST pulls its nose back and skews off to the right
MASTER CHIEF jumps clear -
— as the GHOST and PILOT fly off the rock face into an eight

hundred foot drop to oblivion

EXT HALOSUMMIT RIDGE - DAY

MASTER CHIEF lands hard
Flat on his back in the soft earth
visor reflecting the sky

A peaceful beat

CORTANA
Chief
MASTER CHIEF
I know
(beat)

Theres one more

He sits up - leaving an imprint of his figure in the ground
He landed so hard that the earth beneath him was compressed
by two inches
Several metres away from him is the third and final GHOST
It is strafing into position about to attack
MASTER CHIEF stands
A beat on the two enemies facing each other
Then -

cur To

EXT HALOMACHINERY CONSTRUCTION - DAY

A huge spire of metal pushes out from one of HALO’S lightly
forested slopes

Beneath it are lower complexes of machinery Tubes and
shafts - a fraction of some massive engine mostly buried
beneath the gently undulating swells of meadow

And also beneath the metal spire is another LIFEBOAT with
MARINES fanned out around it - firing at a large number of
advancing Covenant troops

We join the MARINE group in the heat of battle They are
fighting well working in pairs laying down covering fire as
they regroup and switch positions

but from the sheer number of Covenant troops it is clear
that this battle is one-sided

WOUNDED MARINE
MEDIC

SERGEANT
Watch the left flank Weve got
more coming through the trees

WOUNDED MARINE
MEDI —-

The WOUNDED MARINE is cut off by a round from a plasma rifle
that burns out the side of his head

MARINE
Ammo Running low on ammo here

MARINE

(as a Covenant in his gun-
sight drops)

Get up so I can kill you again

MARINE
Theyre going to overrun us

MARINE
Where’s the back up

MARINE
We dont have no back-up

MARINE
(panicking)
Were screwed man Were scre -

The PANICKING MARINE breaks off as a blur of movement FLIES
over their heads

A GHOST
Piloted by the MASTER CHIEF

Accelerating directly at the COVENANT troops twin PLASMA
CANONS blazing

MARINE
Whoa

MARINE
What the Hell is that

SERGEANT
The cavalry

EXT HALOMACHINERY CONSTRUCTION DAY

The aftermath of the battle
Covenant dead lie scattered in sprays of blue blood

The MEDIC patches up wounded MARINES Four dead MARINES lie
in a row Uncovered Gazing sightlessly at the sky

MASTER CHIEF talks to the SERGEANT

SERGEANT
We need to regroup with other
survivors They must be scattered
all over this ring
MASTER CHIEF
“ Agreed Have you made contact with
any

SERGEANT
Yes sir A Pelican dropship pilot
name of Carol Rawley Call-sign -

MASTER CHIEF
(cuts in)
- Foehammer She’s alive

SERGEANT
Alive and inbound sir

CORTANA
Who’s Foehammer

MASTER CHIEF
A fine soldier We go back

CORTANA

(dry)
So I see Your neural web just lit

up like a Christmas tree

MASTER CHIEF
a What do you mean by that

The SERGEANT looks confused

SERGEANT
Uh - sir Who are you talking to

CORTANA
He can’t hear me

MASTER CHIEF
Oh right
(to the Sergeant)
No one

CORTANA
(indignant)
No one

MASTER CHIEF
I’m not saying youre no one

SERGEANT
I didn’t think you were sir

MASTER CHIEF
No not you
(gives up)
Oh forget it

MASTER CHIEF walks away from the still somewhat perplexed

SERGEANT

He finds a place to sit at the foot of the METAL SPIRE

After a short silence

Silence

Silence

CORTANA
Is this a quiet time

MASTER CHIEF
It was

CORTANA
Sorry
(beat)
I get that it must be strange
Having me with you like this
It’s intimate

CORTANA
If it’s any consolation it’s
pretty strange for me too Sharing
a consciousness

CORTANA
I suppose you want to know if I can
tell what youre thinking

MASTER CHIEF
Can you

CORTANA
Kind of I get flashes
Impulses
(beat)
Its hard to describe

MASTER CHIEF
So what am I thinking now

CORTANA
Youre thinking what I’m thinking
(beat)
What happened to Captain Keyes

EXT HALOPILLAR OF AUTUMN - DAY

The PILLAR OF AUTUMN crash-site

The great battle cruiser was never designed for a gravity
environment It lies now at a slight angle in a crater of
its own making

Behind it is a huge scar gouged into the HALO landscape
Beneath the torn earth and powdered rock we can see the
metal interior of the ring

In places a tunnel system is exposed Chambers opened to
the daylight

And all around the crash-site the COVENANT are swarming

Listening to their language the words themselves may be
meaningless to us but through their gestures and tone the
meaning behind the words somehow comes through

The aliens are EXCITED TRIUMPHANT at the destruction of the
enemy vessel

but noticeably AGITATED and AFRAID of the tunnels
passages and chambers that the crash has revealed

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMNBRIDGE

CAPTAIN KEYES stands in the destroyed bridge Hes bleeding
from the head - but upright and focused

Most of the FLIGHT CREW are dead - but there are some
survivors They are arming themselves and barricading the

entrance to the bridge

CAPTAIN KEYES talks into the COMMS UNIT

CAPTAIN KEYES
Major Silva do you have an ETA

MAJOR SILVA
(over comms link)
Sir - we can see you from our
position
(beat)
(MORE)
Se”

MAJOR SILVA (contd)
The Covenant are all over you
Must be a thousand troops

CAPTAIN KEYES
Understood In the event of radio
silence at my end assume the
transfer of command to you Major

A beat

MAJOR SILVA
(over comms link)
Sir - I

CAPTAIN KEYES
(cuts in)
Negative on futile rescue attempts
Am I clear

MAJOR SILVA
(over comms link)
Crystal sir

CAPTAIN KEYES
Then that’s over And out

CAPTAIN KEYES hangs up the COMMS UNIT

And AT THAT MOMENT -

- the BARRICADE to the bridge is blown apart by a cluster of
PLASMA GRENADES

FLIGHT DECK CREWMAN
Theyre here

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMNBRIDGE

We are with the COVENANT forces as they swarm over the
destroyed barricade and pour into the bridge

We stay the entire time with a JACKAL the slender hunched
bird-like Covenant The JACKAL advances with its comrades
like a roman centurion firing from and crouching behind the
distorting window of an energy shield

We follow the JACKAL as the remaining survivors of the FLIGHT
DECK CREW are cut down Slaughtered under the storm of
fire

Until only CAPTAIN KEYES is left

We watch as CAPTAIN KEYES backs away emptying the clip of
his M6D jamming in another -

- but his position is entirely hopeless

Down to his last bullet surrounded backed into a corner
he suddenly jams his pistol to the side of his head

To kill himself rather than be taken

A beat

Then

COMMANDER KEYES
Damn it

He swings the pistol back and fires his last round

RIGHT THROUGH THE HEAD of the JACKAL we have been
following

A moment later COMMANDER KEYES is swarmed

INT FOEHAMMER’S PELICAN DROPSHIP - DAY

MASTER CHIEF and the MARINES climb on board the Pelican-class
dropship and it lifts off from the METAL SPIRE

There are many more MARINES jammed into the Pelican from
other lifeboats Many are wounded or smoke-blackened from
battle Some sit in silence Some search through the faces
for men from their platoon

MASTER CHIEF makes his way through them down the vessel to
the cockpit

where FOEHAMMER is at the controls

A first-rate drop-ship pilot She has one tone of voice for
all situations a drawl calm and even whether taking heavy
ground-fire or sharing a beer

MASTER CHIEF
Thanks for the ride Foehammer

FOEHAMMER
Always a pleasure Master Chief
Glad you made it off the Autumn

MASTER CHIEF
(indicating the hold full
of Marines)

You’ve been busy

FOEHAMMER
Were spread pretty thin over the
terrain But I’m gathering them
up Major Silva and his
Helljumpers have set up a base camp
thirty klicks from here so I’ve
been shuttling back and forth

MASTER CHIEF
What are our numbers

FOEHAMMER
Better than youd expect Weve
got a fighting force

MASTER CHIEF
A fighting force is all we need

EXT HALOBASE CAMP - DAY

The HELLJUMPERS and MARINES have been working fast
constructing a workable base camp There are at least two
hundred men and women here both SOLDIERS and ENGINEERS

From what they took with them in their evacuation of the
Pillar of Autumn they have managed to put together

A LANDING ZONE - from which FOEHAMMER is already lifting off
again even as another PELICAN comes in to land

An AMMO DUMP - where MARINES queue to stock up their
supplies

As they see MASTER CHIEF the MARINES freeze and stare
Theyve all heard rumors about the SPARTANS but few have
ever seen one

One of them we notice is CORPORAL JENKINS - the soldier who
gave MASTER CHIEF his M6D PISTOL at the barricade

CORPORAL JENKINS
(calls out)
How’s that M6D working out for ya
sir

MASTER CHIEF simply nods as he passes

Once MASTER CHIEF is out of earshot -

MARINE
(whispers )
Holy shit Jenkins - you know that

guy
CORPORAL JENKINS
(casual)
We go back

We move on to -

A makeshift MED CENTER - already struggling with the volume
of wounded and dying Through the open tent flap we can see
several emergency operations on-going

A COMMS TENT - where several TRANSCOM OPERATORS attempt to
coordinate the rescue of the various lifeboats and escape
vessels dotted around HALO

And a COMMAND CENTER - where the MAJOR SILVA and HELLJUMPERS
have located themselves

And it is also where MASTER CHIEF is headed

EXT HALOBASE CAMPCOMMAND CENTER - DAY

Two HELLJUMPERS guard the entrance to the COMMAND CENTER As
MASTER CHIEF approaches they block his way forwards

MAJOR STLVA
Stand down men Let him through

The two guards step aside and MASTER CHIEF walks through

MAJOR SILVA is standing with some of his senior officers -
who regard MASTER CHIEF with a barely disguised hostility

MAJOR SILVA
So The Spartan
(beat)
I understand you’re carrying
Cortana

MASTER CHIEF
Yes sir
MAJOR SILVA
Unfortunately we don’t have any
hardware sufficient for you to dock
her So youll be baby-sitting a
while longer

CORTANA
Baby-sitting

MAJOR SILVA
Think you can handle that

MASTER CHIEF
No problem sir

MAJOR SILVA nods

MAJOR SILVA
Fine Then I recommend you find a
nice little spot to sit tight rest
up and wait until we can relieve
you of your duties

A beat

MASTER CHIEF
You want me to stay out of combat
oe sir

MAJOR SILVA
That is correct I want you to
stay as far out as you can get

MAJOR SILVA turns back to OFFICERS

MAJOR SILVA
Dismissed Spartan

MASTER CHIEF doesn’t move
MAJOR SILVA looks back at him face clouding

MAJOR SILVA
You still here

MASTER CHIEF
Sir - request information on the
whereabouts of -

MAJOR SILVA
- Keyes MIA Everything else is
need to know And before you ask
you don‘t need to know shit

Nexewe”

EXT HALOBASE CAMP - DUSK
Light is fading as MASTER CHIEF walks back across the camp

CORTANA
What a meathead

MASTER CHIEF
He wants me out of combat to keep
you safe

MASTER CHIEF stops walking For a moment he seems to rock
slightly on his heels as if dazed

MASTER CHIEF
It’s a sound decision

Something seems strange about him - but CORTANA doesn’t seem
to have noticed

CORTANA
I’ve met plenty like him The
truth is he enjoys war If he
isn’t putting down rounds he isn’t
living

NOW she breaks off - because MASTER CHIEF has rocked again
For a moment he looks like he is about to topple to the
ground heavy as a forest giant

CORTANA
What the - Chief Are you okay

MASTER CHIEF
(quiet)
Yeah I’m just running a little
low on blood

EXT HALOBASE CAMP - DUSK

MASTER CHIEF has found a quiet place to sit behind the MED
CENTER away from the bustle of the base camp

In front of him is an open MED KIT

We watch as MASTER CHIEF removes the BREAST PLATE of his
armor

Beneath is a black BODY-SUIT made of flexible material And
on this body suit we can see various lacerations around his
torso

Through these lacerations MASTER CHIEF’S torso is partially
revealed and we catch our first glimpse of MASTER CHIEFS
actual flesh

His skin is colored an abnormal sunless snow-white But it’s
hard to tell much more than that given that each wound is
thickly smeared with blood

Some of the blood is congealed almost black like a cooled
lava-flow

Some is bright red and wet welling from multiple injuries

CORTANA
(shocked)
I didn’t realize your armor is
intact

MASTER CHIEF
The armor repairs itself It’s the
stuff beneath that doesn’t

He reaches for the MED KIT

MASTER CHIEF
Unless you help it along

We watch as he begins to tend to himself He uses sterile
wipes to clean away the blood pulls metal fragments from the
wounds

The most serious wound is on his side A long slash perhaps
caused by the impact with the GHOST It is from here that
the blood is flowing most freely

CORTANA
Chief - you’re badly hurt Just
get one of the medics

MASTER CHIEF
Theyve got enough to deal with

He pushes with one gloved hand against the side wound
MASTER CHIEF
Cracked rib Maybe two Doesn’t
feel like there’s anything in
there Just need to
He reaches again for the MED KIT

MASTER CHIEF
patch it up

He pulls out what looks like a STAPLE GUN
And in a sense it is

He puts it over the wound squeezes the grip several times in
rapid succession - and each time he squeezes a METAL STAPLE

fires into his flesh then retracts clamping the two side of
the wound together

When he has finished he has a row of staples like suture
stitches

He exhales hard and puts the STAPLE GUN down
The whole process looks amazingly painful

MASTER CHIEF
Huh

CORTANA
«- What

MASTER CHIEF
Forgot the morphine

FADE TO -

The same scene MASTER CHIEF has replaced his breast-plate
and is now attaching a blood drip It feeds into a purpose-
made access point in his MJOLNIR armor positioned on the
underside of his forearm

CORTANA
Simple as that is it Fill
yourself back up and youll be
ready to go Just like replacing
the fuel cell on a warthog

MASTER CHIEF
Just like

With the blood drip now in place MASTER CHIEF lies down
helmet resting against a rock chin against his chest

CORTANA
You humans are unbelievable You
spend half your time thinking about
how to make computers think like
humans and the other half trying
to make humans act like machines
Sometimes I truly wonder what -

MASTER CHIEF
(cutting in)
Cortana

CORTANA
» Yes

MASTER CHIEF
I have a question

CORTANA
Go ahead

MASTER CHIEF
How do I turn you off

Silence

FADE TO

MASTER CHIEFS DREAM

A BURNING CITY
Then -
TWIN RED SUNS
Then -

MASTER CHIEF

He is standing alone surrounded by corpses both SPARTAN and

COVENANT

The corpses fan around him in an outward pattern like a
forest whose trees have been felled by a central cataclysm

A beat
Then MASTER CHIEF lifts his hands
and REMOVES his helmet

As implied when we saw him tending his wounds his skin is
bleached white His hair is shaved to the scalp

He gazes at the tableau of death and devastation as if he
wants to see this scene unfiltered

Then - on MASTER CHIEF’S face A slight confusion An
awareness of another presence
Saye

He turns -
- and behind him is a girl

She could be in her twenties But theres something very
strange about her skin - stranger even than the skin of
MASTER CHIEF

It glows softly with a purplish blue light
And both her skin and clothes have the same translucent
quality as the CORTANA CHIP - flickering light strands like

miniature blood vessels shifting microcircuitry

MASTER CHIEF
Who are you

CORTANA
«-- You don’t recognize me
Beat
CORTANA
And by the way You can’t turn me

off

MASTER CHIEF
Cortana What are you doing here

CORTANA
I’m in your head If you dream I
dream

MASTER CHIEF turns away Back to the bodies

CORTANA
What is this place

MASTER CHIEF
You mean what was this place
(beat)
The largest interplanetary human
colony One hundred and sixty four
thousand died here Men women
children

CORTANA
- Planet Reach

MASTER CHIEF
(confirming)
Planet Reach

Silence

MASTER CHIEF
We were supposed to defend it

CORTANA
Who

MASTER CHIEF
The Spartans
(beat)
But we failed

He looks down at a dead SPARTAN at his feet visor smashed
armor half blown away

CORTANA
- How did you survive

MASTER CHIEF
Foehammer It was just me a pile
of bodies and a Covenant armada
But she came back for me Said she
didn’t leave soldiers

In the background distant there is the sound of a scream

MASTER CHIEF
behind

MASTER CHIEF breaks off listening

Silence
Then -
- the scream comes again

Deep guttural desperate And not human But not quite
animal either

The scream grows louder and louder

cur TO

EXT HALOBASE CAMP - NIGHT

MASTER CHIEF wakes with a start

While he has slept night has fallen
44

And the scream is still continuing If anything it is even
louder and more piercing Not a feature of his dream then
but something that had filtered into his unconscious from
somewhere in the basecamp

MASTER CHIEF rips the drip out of his arm rises grabbing
his gun and runs to trace the source

EXT HALOBASE CAMPCOMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

MASTER CHIEF pushes through the guards into the HELLJUMPER
command center

-- to find MAJOR SILVA and his officers standing over a
COVENANT ELITE

The ELITE is tied spread-eagle And it is clearly from the
alien that the scream has been heard

It is equally clear that screams have been the result of the
creature’s torture

As MASTER CHIEF arrives -

HELLJUMPER
(to Major Silva)
He’s told us everything he knows

MAJOR SILVA
Thats fine He told us plenty
Put a snatch squad together - we
move at once
(turning to the limp
Elite)
As for our POW

MAJOR SILVA lifts his M6D pistol and puts the barrel against
the ELITE’S head

MAJOR SILVA
Any last words

ELITE
(digitized translation)
A word for you sinner Repent
MAJOR SILVA smiles

MAJOR SILVA
You bet
gee

--- then fires directly into the ELITE’S face at point-blank
range

It is shockingly brutal
When it’s over MAJOR SILVA simply holsters his weapon
Only then does he notice MASTER CHIEF

MAJOR STLVA
Something I can help you with
Spartan

CORTANA
Maybe it’s us who can help you

MAJOR SILVAS eyebrows raise with surprise
» as CORTANA appears walking into frame

She is much less tangible more translucent than she
appeared in MASTER CHIEF’S dream Clearly a projected
hologram - nothing more than light breaking apart slightly
with ripples of static

MAJOR SILVA
-» What the -

MASTER CHIEF is as surprised to see CORTANA as SILVA

CORTANA
What do you need a snatch squad
for Major

MAJOR SILVA
Who’s asking

CORTANA
The Pillar of Autumn AI And
before you ask my need-to-know is
total

A beat

MAJOR SILVA
Keyes let himself be taken alive
The Covenant have him on board
their orbiting battle cruiser
Truth and Reconciliation Which
means we have to assume they’1ll be
interrogating him Finding out
about Earth

CORTANA
They won’t break him

MAJOR SILVA
Everyone breaks But he’1ll hold
out long enough

MASTER CHIEF
(a beat ahead)
You‘re going in there

MAJOR SILVA
No option

CORTANAS eyes open wide - suddenly alive

CORTANA
We’re coming too

MAJOR SILVA
That risk is out of the question
ma’am - ox whatever the Hell I call
you

CORTANA

(excited)
You dont understand Major This
could be the most extraordinary
opportunity the chance for an AI
to access Covenant computer
systems

(to Master Chief)
If you can get me to any kind of
control panel we could learn
everything about them Their
weaknesses their plans Its the
kind of breakthrough that could
turn the path of this war

CORTANA turns back to MAJOR SILVA She knows she’s got him
beat

CORTANA
Are you going to be remembered as
the man who let that opportunity
slip through his fingers

EXT HALOBASE CAMP - NIGHT

MASTER CHIEF heads through the camp to the ammo dump with
CORTANA walking a few steps ahead of him

CORTANA
I hope you don’t feel I went over
your head Chief

MASTER CHIEF
Everything about you is over my
head How did you even do that

CORTANA
What - push around Silva

MASTER CHIEF
Appear

EXT HALOBASE CAMPAMMO DUMP - NIGHT

As CORTANA explains MASTER CHIEF selects grenades and
takes ammo for his M6D pistol

CORTANA
Just a little tweak to your HUD I
recalibrated the projection level
to a couple of metres instead of
the inside of your visor
(shrugs)

-» and here I am I can appear
anywhere within your line of sight
More or less a one-eighty degree
radius But if I go over here

CORTANA moves to the side - and the image flickers out of
view

CORTANA
I vanish

MASTER CHIEF turns his head in the direction she
disappeared

and she returns again

MASTER CHIEF
And why did you choose to look

like
(searches for the right
word)
o that
CORTANA
(innocent)

Like what
Megs

MASTER CHIEF
Distracting

CORTANA
You mean pretty

MASTER CHIEF is done choosing weapons
He turns away from her and she vanishes again

MASTER CHIEF
Just keep out my way during combat

cur TO

EXT HALO NIGHT

MAJOR SILVA twenty HELLJUMPERS and MASTER CHIEF lie flat on
a rock outcrop looking down at a COVENANT position through
binoculars

Through their sights they can see a GRAVITY LIFT to the
Covenant battle cruiser Truth and Reconciliation

The gravity lift is simply a metal platform with a beam of
purple light firing directly upwards like a fixed and
powerful searchlight

Three hundred metres above this beam connects to the
Covenant battle cruiser tracking HALO at precisely the
ring’‘s spin rate

Periodically JACKALS appear from the lift base in a bright
purple flare They are carrying boxes of supplies down to
the HALO’S surface

Other JACKALS enter the bright light rise and disappear

HELLUUMPER
(quiet)
That is some freaky shit

MAJOR SILVA
Teleportation

CORTANA
(back in non-projected
form)
It‘s not teleportation

(Note unless specified CORTANA is always in non-projected
form and only audible to Master Chief
49

CORTANA
Its just a very fast ride up
Some kind of reverse gravity
effect Like pushing the wrong
poles of two magnets together

MASTER CHIEF
We don’t need to know how it works
We just need to know how to use it

CORTANA
Step in and hold tight

A HELLJUMPER slides up to the rock outcrop - back from his
recce

HELLJUMPER
I’ve got six Jackals patrolling the
perimeter A few Grunts scattered
here and there - half of them
sleeping And no Elites

MAJOR SILVA
Seems like they don’t believe
anyone would try a direct assault
on their cruiser So lets disabuse
them of that idea

MAJOR SILVA lowers his binoculars

MAJOR SILVA
Okay Spread out Move in quiet
Knife-work only I want to take
this position without laying down a
single round

EXT HALOGRAVITY LIFT

A succession of quiet kills

MASTER CHIEF breaks the neck of a JACKAL using one hand to
clamp its mouth shut

A HELLJUMPER throws a stone whilst hiding in a shallow
gully As the JACKAL GUARD looks over the lip of the gully
to investigate the HELLJUMPER’S arm jabs up sinking the
knife directly into the JACKALS head entering just under the
chin

MAJOR SILVA slides his knife between the armor plates of a
sleeping GRUNT who struggles in his grip a few moments
before dying

END ON -

A JACKAL appearing from the GRAVITY LIFT carrying a crate of
plasma grenades

The alien looks around confused

It speaks something in Covenant tongue

We don’t know what - but by the upturn in tone at the end of
the exclamation we assume it is along the lines of Where
did everyone go

It takes a few steps

Then looks around

To see the line of human soldiers standing behind it
silhouettes against the night sky

A moment later there is a flash of movement from MAJOR
SILVA Then a flash of spinning blade

and the JACKAL drops - a knife sunk into its chest up to
the hilt

INT TRUTH AND RECONCILIATIONLOADING BAY

With multiple pulses of light MASTER CHIEF MAJOR SILVA and
the HELLJUMPERS start to appear out of the GRAVITY LIFT

into one of the LOADING BAYS of the Covenant ship

Now stealth is not an option

Inside the Loading Bay are at least twenty GRUNTS and JACKALS
— and they have all turned as one to see the human troops
pour from the beam of light

MASTER CHIEF first out opens fire immediately

The following HELLJUUMPERS do the same

For a few intense seconds the Loading Bay is alive with the
sound of gunfire

Then it is over The Covenant lie dead
Silence

The soldiers wait weapons raised listening

The silence continues

a HELLJUMPER
You think we got away with it

HELLJUMPER
I can’t hear any alarms sounding

HELLJUMPER
Wait You hear that

They all fall silent again

From somewhere outside the Loading Bay there is a muffled
thump

HELLJUMPER
I heard it

A moment later there is another thump Then another
And the thumps are getting louder

HELLJUMPER
You thinking what I’m thinking

HELLJUMPER
Nema” Has to be

HELLJUMPER
(quiet)
God damn
Now the thumps are RIGHT OUTSIDE the main Loading Bay doors
And AT THAT MOMENT -
- they suddenly stop
Silence again
Held
Then -
BLAM The METAL DOORS of the Loading Bay explode outwards
and a MASSIVE hulking figure LUNGES through
HELLJUMPER

(yells)
HUNTERS

sae
Same

HUNTERS Twelve foot tall six foot wide covered head to toe
in blue armor a Fuel-Rod Canon integrated into the right arm
— which glows green as it is charging up to fire - anda
shield integrated into its left arm

MASTER CHIEF and the HELLJUMPERS all open up as the HUNTER
charges them

and the bullets simply bounce off

And worse yet out of the twisted remains of the loading bay
doors a SECOND HUNTER follows the first

HELLJUMPER
Here comes the gecond one

The FIRST HUNTER runs into the HELLJUMPERS like a bowling
ball into pins

As the men scatter one of them is clubbed by the alien’s
shielded arm - and knocked with unambiguously lethal force
into the wall

cuT TO —

MASTER CHIEF firing his assault rifle into the FIRST HUNTER
From every fifth tracer round we can see the bullets
glancing off the tank-like armor

CORTANA
CHIEF

MASTER CHIEF’S head snaps around just in time to see the
second HUNTER with a fully charged FUEL-ROD CANON

pointed right at him
MASTER CHIEF dives for cover as the creature fires
The bolt misses MASTER CHIEF but the detonation has the

strength to pick him up and send him skidding across the
loading bay floor towards a collection of METAL CONTAINERS

INT TRUTH AND RECONCILIATIONLOADING BAYMETAL CONTAINERS

MASTER CHIEF scrambles for the METAL CONTAINERS just making
cover ag another bolt from the FUEL ROD CANON explodes near
by

CORTANA
Chief Youve got to do something

MASTER CHIEF
(as he calmly swaps mags)
I am doing something

Right in front of him is a crate of blue spheres softly
glowing

MASTER CHIEF
Plasma grenades We’re in
business

INT TRUTH AND RECONCILIATIONLOADING BAY

We are behind the SECOND HUNTER as it fires another bolt
into the HELLJUMPERS position - killing two more of the
special forces

Beyond it we can see the FIRST HUNTER smashing crates out
of the way revealing where more of the scattered HELLJUMPERS
have tried to find cover Using its shield as a club again
it swings down on a HELLJUMPER - killing him also

As the SECOND HUNTER charges up its canon for another
strike

MASTER CHIEF appears into frame behind it holding a
PLASMA GRENADE in his right hand -

which he throws sticking the adhesive bomb right on the
creature’s back

The HUNTER growls - a noise with a question mark at the end
of it

« and turns

And as the alien comes to face him he throws a second
grenade - right in the creatures face

The HUNTER’S growl raises to an enraged ROAR - as it
desperately tries to claw the adhesive grenade from its armor

during which time MASTER CHIEF has stuck a THIRD grenade
on its RIGHT ARM

Then the SPARTAN dives for cover
And a moment later -

— the PLASMA GRENADES explode with spectacular result

Three detonations in rapid succession BANG-BANG-BANG
The first - on its back —- knocks the HUNTER forwards

The second on its face - blows its helmet straight off its
shoulders

The third - on its CANON integrated arm - blows its arm off
its shoulder socket

A beat

Then the mutilated giant crashes to the floor

cut To -

The FIRST HUNTER is just about to crush another HELLJUMPER
But it hesitates arm raised

as what looks like a large soccer ball rolls between its
legs

The decapitated HELMET of the obliterated HUNTER comes to a
stop gazing up at its comrade

A beat

The HUNTER turns and sees at the other end of the loading
bay MASTER CHIEF holding the severed CANON arm Which is
glowing green

A moment later the FUEL-ROD BOLT is blazing across the
loading bay like a miniature comet -

- where it strikes the HUNTER full on and blows it into
oblivion

INT TRUTH AND RECONCILIATIONLOADING BAY

A HELLJUMPER looks down at the corpse of the HUNTER felled by
MASTER CHIEF

Out of the armor a large EEL-LIKE CREATURE writhes out It
is colored a bright orange and is just over a metre long
The EEL is followed by another and another We realise as
the form of the armor collapses that HUNTERS are actually
made up of these writhing creatures

The HELLJUMPER reaches down and lifts the head of the first
EEL with one hand Reflexively the EEL wraps itself around
the HELLJUMPERS arm
Sea

then goes limp as the HELLJUUMPER’S combat knife slides
into its mouth and rips open its neck

Behind this freakish scene
MAJOR SILVA storms up to MASTER CHIEF

MAJOR SILVA
Nice work Spartan First out the
gate and you start blazing Screw
stealth Just tell the whole
Covenant army where we are

MASTER CHIEF
The bay was full TI had no choice

MAJOR SILVA
I guess I’1ll have to take your word
for that won’t I
He turns to his remaining HELLUUMPERS
He’s lost seven of his twenty men
MAJOR SILVA
If we’re going to get to the
Captain we’re going to need a
“soeee diversion

A HELLJUMPER steps forwards

HELLJUMPER
Sir Give me five men

MAJOR SILVA
Done Don’t care how you do it
Just keep them off our backs
(beat)
Its going to be a one way trip
You square with that

HELLJUMPER
Well see you in Hell sir

MAJOR SILVA

That is correct soldier You
surely will

INT TRUTH AND RECONCILIATIONCORRIDOR

MASTER CHIEF MAJOR SILVA and the eight remaining HELLJUMPERS
move fast and quiet down a corridor

CORTANA
He wouldn’t have to take your word
for it if he’d been first out the
gate
MASTER CHIEF makes no reply

Ahead of him the POINT MAN of the group freezes and raises a
closed fist

He has reached the doorway to a split-level HANGER

From their position a GANTRY runs across the higher level of
the hanger Below the lower level is full of Covenant
troops

AT THAT MOMENT -—
- a distant explosion vibrates through the ship

MAJOR SILVA
Sounds like our diversion

Commotion among the ELITES - they start to move

INT TRUTH AND RECONCILIATIONHANGERGANTRY

MASTER CHIEF MAJOR SILVA and the HELLJUMPERS crawl along the
gantry on their hands and knees while below them ELITES
shout orders at JACKALS and GRUNTS

INT TRUTH AND RECONCILIATIONHANGER

On the lower level of the hanger a squad of GRUNTS are
falling into position under the orders of an ELITE

except one GRUNT - who has not fallen into position yet
Instead he has been distracted by a movement up on the
GANTRY

Its the line of HELLJUMPERS moving across

The GRUNT stands looking upwards just about to make sense
of what he sees -

- when he is SUDDENLY cuffed sideways by the ELITE Knocked
to the floor the GRUNT is then dragged squealing back into
his squad as they march out of the hanger double-time
Seana”

INT TRUTH AND RECONCILIATIONCORRIDOR

The commando unit move silently down a corridor - passing a
side chamber on their left

CORTANA
Chief - stop

MASTER CHIEF glances down into the side chamber
Inside is a large bank of what seem to be COMPUTER SYSTEMS
The systems are being monitored by a single JACKAL

CORTANA
I think that’s what I’m looking
for

INT TRUTH AND RECONCILIATIONCOMPUTER ROOM

The JACKAL lies dead on the floor and the HELLJUMPERS guard
the entrance

MASTER CHIEF stands by a central console and has inserted
CORTANA’S chip into the terminal

CORTANA is holographically manifested in front of MASTER
CHIEF She is studying the central console running her
fingers across it as if experiencing a tactile quality

CORTANA
Interesting I can directly access
the Covenant battle-net None of
their systems are protected

MASTER CHIEF
Meaning

CORTANA
An implication about their culture
Loyalty Or servility They
obviously trust their own more than
we do

She pauses

CORTANA
I’ve found Keyes He’s on the deck
below us

Wait
(MORE )

CORTANA (contd)
(beat)

Good Okay I’ve set up a few

diversions of my own Triggered
ew alarm calls in twenty different
sectors and sealed some of the
routes That should ease the way a
bit

MASTER CHIEF
How much longer do you need

CORTANA
Not long Just a few more moments
I‘m downloading their -

She breaks off

MASTER CHIEF

What
CORTANA
I
CORTANA frowns
CORTANA
No It can’t be It isn’t
possible
MASTER CHIEF
Cortana

Then an expression of real alarm appears on CORTANA’S face
She steps back from the console

CORTANA
Disconnect me

MASTER CHIEF
Whats going on

CORTANA
Too much to explain We just need
to get Keyes and get out of here
Now

INT TRUTH AND RECONCILIATIONTORTURE CELLS

CLOSE UP on the face of CAPTAIN KEYES

He’s blood-smeared wide-eyed and screaming
“ome

PULE-BACK to reveal that “he is-strapped to an intricate -
machine organic in design crackling with energy
From the machine around CAPTAIN KEYES’ bare arms and torso

are literally thousands of tiny barbed and segmented needle -
like insect legs They are buried in his flesh

It doesn’t take much to figure out that this is a torture
machine

The surge of power in the machine subsides and KEYES slumps
too weak even to meet the gaze of

the face of the BLACK ELITE who leans in and speaks to
CAPTAIN KEYES in his own language

BLACK ELITE
Sinner the blasphemy of your form
is not beyond redemption We wish
this war to end

The BLACK ELITE leans closer

BLACK ELITE
Tell us of your home world and we
will wash it clean

CAPTAIN KEYES finds the strength to lift his head
He meets the eyes of the BLACK ELITE

BLACK ELITE
Make your choice sinner Talk to
me Or die

CAPTAIN KEYES holds the alien’s pitiless stare

CAPTAIN KEYES
(quiet beaten)
I choose death

Beat

CAPTAIN KEYES
Yours

The next moment a spray of blue blood spurts out from the
BLACK ELITE’s head and he drops

to reveal MAJOR SILVA behind holding a smoking M6D
pistol

MAJOR SILVA
(to the Helljumpers)
Get him out of that thing

INT TRUTH AND RECONCILIATIONCORRIDOR

MASTER CHIEF and the commando unit move as fast as KEYES can
travel

CAPTAIN KEYES
How the Hell did you get on this
ship Actually never mind that
How do we get off

MASTER CHIEF
Cortana has cleared a route to one
of their bays We’re heading for a
dropship

They have reached a door at the end of the corridor

CAPTAIN KEYES
Simple as that

MASTER CHIEF opens the door - revealing a hanger bay with a
dropship ready to fly And thirty COVENANT TROOPS - which
all turn to face the humans

MASTER CHIEF
Pretty much

As the humans open fire -

cur TO

EXT HALOBASE CAMP - SUNRISE

Dawn over the ring

And coming through the sunrise is an erratically flown
COVENANT DROPSHIP belching thick black smoke behind it

Two MARINES on a gun-mounted LOOKOUT POST watch the ship come
in

MARINE
Is that thing coming our way

He starts to swing the MACHINE GUN to bear on the already
severely wounded vessel

The second MARINE raises a hand

MARINE
Wait I’ve got a call coming
through on the comms link
(incredulous)
It’s one of ours

EXT HALOBASE CAMPLANDING PAD - SUNRISE

The smoking dropship comes in hard and fast

MARINES and ENGINEERS scatter from the makeshift landing pad
just before it hits

with a loud thump and an almighty cloud of dust
As the dust settles the doors open and MASTER CHIEF walks
out followed by CAPTAIN KEYES MAJOR SILVA and the surviving
HELLJUMPERS
The BASE CAMP erupts into cheers
Only one soldier seems unimpressed A human dropship pilot
FOEHAMMER
(as Master Chief passes)

Was that you at the helm

MASTER CHIEF

Yep

FOEHAMMER
Remind me to give you some flying
lessons

MASTER CHIEF
I got her down didn’t I

FOEHAMMER
Yeah You got her down alright

As the dust is settling the image of the COVENANT DROPSHIP
starts to resolve

It is a mess Crumpled tilted panels hanging off stiil
pouring black smoke

FOERAMMER
Real down

INT BASE CAMPCOMMAND TENT - DAY

CORTANA holographically manifested is debriefing CAPTAIN
KEYES MAJOR SILVA MASTER CHIEF FOEHAMMER and a handful of
MARINE OFFICERS

CORTANA

This orbital was constructed by an
ancient race known by the Covenant
as the ‘Forerunners’ It seems
that they left ruins and artifacts
all over the galaxy Some of those
artifacts are the technology that
the Covenant employ And another
of those artifacts is this ring

CORTANA creates a new holographic image beside her a three
dimensional scale vector representation of the ring world

CORTANA
They call it Halo

CLOSE IN on the vector hologram of HALO as CORTANA speaks

CORTANA

As we are already aware the
Covenant decided for reasons best
known to themselves that humankind
was an object of blasphemy
requiring extinction

(beat)
In Halo we now appear to have
found an object of worship

PULL BACK again

CAPTAIN KEYES
Halo is their God

CORTANA
I think it would be better to say
that it is their church and the
Forerunners are their Gods

CAPTAIN KEYES
Makes a kind of sense If this
ring is anything to go by the
technology of the ancients would
have been far in advance of the
Covenant
CORTANA
Not to mention our own

MAJOR SILVA
I aint going to start praying to
them

Several of the MARINE OFFICERS start to laugh

CORTANA
(through the laughter)
But there’s something else
Something important

Silence again

Silence

CORTANA
It’s hard to accurately interpret
the data But according to the
Covenant message traffic Halo is a
weapon

CAPTAIN KEYES
A weapon Of what kind

CORTANA
It isn’t clear Im not even sure
the Covenant know themselves but
they repeatedly describe the
destructive power as
‘unimaginable’

CAPTAIN KEYES
I do not like that

CORTANA
It gets worse When the Pillar of
Autumn crashed the Covenant
believe it disrupted something
Under the ring surface

CAPTAIN KEYES
The armament system

CORTANA
No Something else They don’t
even have a name for it But
whatever it is it terrifies them

CAPTAIN KEYES
Okay From what youve told us
our mission is clear If Halo is a
weapon we need to prevent the
Covenant from being able to use it

CORTANA
The Covenant refer to a location
called ‘The Silent Cartographer’
It seems to be a map room which
reveals the position of Halo’s
control center Obviously that
control center is our best bet to
shut the system down

CAPTAIN KEYES
And where is the map room

The holographic of HALO zooms in - revealing a strip of beach
coastline rising up to steep cliff faces

CORTANA
Somewhere beneath here

FOEHAMMER
I know where that is Two
lifeboats came down on the same
beach and I only pulled out three
survivors The LZ is hot

CAPTAIN KEYES
Too hot to get Master Chief and
four squads of Marines in there

FOEHAMMER looks sideways to MASTER CHIEF and winks

FOEHAMMER
Piece of cake

MAJOR SILVA reacts to this

MAJOR SILVA
Sir - permission to speak freely

CAPTAIN KEYES
Granted

MAJOR SILVA
Why send the Spartan The
Helljumpers sleep locked and
loaded Were ready right now
(MORE)
MAJOR SILVA (contd)
If this weapon-system needs a take-
down it‘s just the job my men were
trained for

CAPTAIN KEYES
Point Major But I have other
plans for the Helljumpers

MAJOR SILVA
Sir what could be more important
than —

CAPTAIN KEYES
(cutting in)
T don’t know what we uncovered when
the Pillar of Autumn came down but
I do know this If the Covenant
are scared of it I want it

CAPTAIN KEYES
Major Silva and the Helljumpers
will be coming with me

EXT HALOBASE CAMPCOMMAND CENTER - DAY

The soldiers are filing out of the COMMAND TENT

MASTER CHIEF catches MAJOR SILVA up

MASTER CHIEF

MAJOR SILVA stops

MASTER CHIEF
I’m used to taking flak from
everywhere but my own side With
respect sir -— just what is your
problem with me

MAJOR SILVA
You want me to spell it out
Spartan I’m pretty good at
spelling things out

MASTER CHIEF
Go ahead

The HALO holographic rotates to CLOSE IN on the PILLAR OF
AUTUMN crash-site

MAJOR SILVA
Okay First things first - pop
your cover

A beat Then MASTER CHIEF unclips and removes his helmet

The remainder of this scene is played over MASTER CHIEFS
shoulder so that his face is NOT revealed

MAJOR SILVA
See now - that would be part of my
problem right there Exactly what
kind of genetic screw-up are you
(without waiting for an
answer)
I’m neck-deep in blood and shit
fighting a war for humanity But
the man at my side isn’t even a
man He’s fighting for something
he isn’t You follow me so far

MASTER CHIEF says nothing

MAJOR SILVA
Good Then I’1l just add this
Planet Reach Twin sun system
Current human population zero

Silence
MAJOR SILVA returns MASTER CHIEF’S gaze evenly
Then turns and leaves
MASTER CHIEF replaces his helmet
Another moment of silence before
CORTANA
Planet Reach He can’t seriously
blame you for that
MASTER CHIEF

(understated)
Why not I do

cut To

INT FOEHAMMER’S PELICAN DROPSHIP - DAY

The bay doors of the dropship open to reveal we are flying
fast and low over water
Nea

Ahead is the strip of coast line and cliff-faces we saw on
the holographic

And from the beach there is already INCOMING plasma fire from
Covenant forces

This is the opening image of the BEACH ATTACK SEQUENCE

EXT HALOBEACH - DAY

THE BEACH ATTACK

In bright sunshine the attack begins Eerily as much like a
Normandy beach-assault as a fight on an artificial world
light years from Earth

MARINES jump from the DROPSHIP landing thigh-deep in the
water firing as they make their way to the sand Many are
cut down before they even reach the sand

FIRE from the dropship streaks overhead towards the COVENANT
positions

The NOISE is overwhelming

FRAGMENTATION GRENADES explode up ahead showing sand and
shrapnel

A PLASMA GRENADE adheres to a MARINE Screaming he tries to
claw it off him - until it explodes tearing him apart

Other MARINES are hit by fire from GRUNTS carrying NEEDLERS
It is the first time we have seen this strange weapon It
fires a rapid succession burst of pinkish shards that leave
a light trail as they home in on their target - collecting in
the victim like porcupine spines then DETONATING

The WATER of the beach laps red from MARINE corpses lying in
the gentle swell

And INTO THIS -

— MASTER CHIEF is released from the back of the DROPSHIP
driving a WARTHOG the multi-terrain four-wheel vehicle

A MARINE mans the HEAVY MACHINE GUN that is swivel mounted on
the back

Another MARINE is riding shotgun firing a steady stream of
rounds from his assault rifle

We have seen MASTER CHIEFS combat abilities Here we see
the most amazing display of driving ability

The WARTHOG tears up the beach skidding and four-wheel
drifting around boulders and between plasma grenades

A JACKAL is smeared across its bonnet like a bug hitting a
windscreen

An ELITE is sucked under the wheels and dragged beneath the
vehicle - where ELITE’S shield shorts out lighting up the
underside of the WARTHOG like a hot-rod’s fluorescent

Meanwhile the gunners rain fire on the Covenants ripping
through ELITE and JACKAL shields in seconds cutting GRUNTS
to pieces

Gradually the sound of the fighting subsides becomes less a
wall of noise than sporadic bursts

»» until the last noise is the revving of the WARTHOG’S
engine

MASTER CHIEF slides to a halt and turns the engine off

All is quiet

Bodies and shellholes smoulder The COVENANT are all dead
The MARINES have lost half their fighting force But the
beach is won

EXT HALOBEACHENTRANCE TO INTERIOR - DAY

And now we see what the COVENANT were fighting so hard to
protect

Protruding from the cliffs is another example of the strange
Forerunner machinery But this one is more explicable
Temple-like it contains an entrance

« around which the MASTER CHIEF and the surviving thirty
MARINES cluster peering in to the dark interior

Among them is CORPORAL JENKINS

CORPORAL JENKINS
- Sir That where we’re heading

MASTER CHIEF
It is
“Sap”

CORPORAL JENKINS
Awww shit How‘d I know you were
going to say that

MARINE
Cancel Christmas
SERGEANT
Okay boys Move it up Were

going in

INT HALOCHAMBER

A steep ramp leads down under the ring surface and into a
large CHAMBER from which many corridors and passages lead
The chamber is similar in design terms to the machinery
fragments that jut out of the HALO landscape - this is the
iceberg that lies beneath

Covering the walls and floor are etched and intricate non-
pictorial markings - shapes swirls patterns If they have
a meaning it seems to have died with the Forerunners

The lighting is low and the light sources are unclear

There are luminescent panels around the architecture but in
addition to these some of the structures and buttresses seem
to emit light themselves as if impregnated with fibre
optics

Aside from a background hum of energy the chamber is quiet

CORTANA
This place is not just functional
It’s aesthetic It has a sense
of

As CORTANA speaks MASTER CHIEF has been walking to the far
end of the chamber where the floor suddenly falls away to a
sheer drop

Revealing a VAST CHASM of apparently endless depth

CORTANA
grandeur

More ramps and platforms lead down the walls of the chasm
MASTER CHIEF

Let me guess the map room is down
there

INT HALOCHASM

MASTER CHIEF leads the men down the ramps and platforms
The MARINES proceed in cautiously

CORPORAL JENKINS’ foot accidentally dislodges a small pebble
which falls into the abyss Transfixed by the sense of the
abyss JENKINS watches it fall

SERGEANT
Stay in formation soldier Let me
see your training

CORPORAL JENKINS
(refocusing)
Yes sir

Around them they can see yet more passages leading out of
and into the chasm walls

MASTER CHIEF
This place is pretty big

CORTANA
You have no idea Just from the
few areas the Covenant have mapped
they have already found an interior
surface area which is ten times the
size of the exterior

MASTER CHIEF
Where do all the passages lead

CORTANA
That‘s one of the strange things
Many of them lead nowhere Or
simply loop fragment and return
back on themselves

MASTER CHIEF
A labyrinth

CORTANA
No - I don’t think so If
anything it most closely
resembles microcircuits Ona
massive scale
“eager

INT HALOHUB
MASTER CHIEF and the MARINES enter a new space

Different to the first chamber they encountered Darker
emphasizing the distance from the surface they have now
travelled

Some of the light comes from SLIM ELONGATED TWIN-POINTED
SHAPES positioned at regular intervals around the room
giving off a pale white glow

The room itself is clearly a hub - a seven-pointed star-—
shape each point leading into an unusually wide passage
from which smaller capillaries bleed off

CORTANA
Hmm

MASTER CHIEF
I definitely don’t want you to tell
me you’re lost

A little distance away a couple of the MARINES confer

MARINE
(quiet)
Did he just say ‘lost’

SERGEANT
(quiet)
Keep your cool Wesker

MARINE (WESKER)
(quiet)
I‘m cool alright My blood’s like
God-damn ice Got goosebumps
Shaking

Back to Master Chief

CORTANA
I’m not lost I just picked
something up on the transcom
Sounded like Covenant radio
chatter

MASTER CHIEF
Theres bound to be some down here
Surprised we haven’t run into them
already in fact

CORTANA
Yes but from the strength of the
signal they’re near As in very
near

MASTER CHIEF
-- How near

Beat

CORTANA
In this room

Silence

MASTER CHIEF scans around Aside from the MARINES the room
is sufficiently well-lit to confirm it is empty

But MASTER CHIEFS own battle-senses are now tingling too

MASTER CHIEF
You‘re right I can almost smell
them

CORTANA
Hell of a place for an ambush No
cover and they could come from
anywhere

MASTER CHIEF
(to Marines)
Marines Three-sixty formation
Now
Immediately the MARINES form a circle formation
MARINE (WESKER)
What are we supposed to be looking
out for I can’t see shit
The SERGEANT flashes him an angry look

MARINES (WESKER)
I know Keep my cool

MASTER CHIEF keeps scanning -
- then freezes He thinks he’s seen something

He is gazing at one of the SLIM ELONGATED SHAPES that are
distributed around the room
scene

There’s something odd about it Behind the shape there is a
slight shimmer like a heat haze

MASTER CHIEF shifts his position slightly and sees that the
shimmer is defined

CUT BACK TO -

Directly in front of MARINE WESKER an elongated triangle
seems to detach itself from the wall

WESKER realizes at the same moment we do that the shape is
not a light after all

It is an ENERGY SWORD And it is being wielded by a STEALTH
ELITE

The next moment the SWORD is slicing through the air -

- and WESKER is literally cut in half

NOW PULL BACK to reveal from ALL ANGLES the ENERGY SWORDS
‘detaching’ from the walls and STEALTH ELITES rushing in
MASTER CHIEF °
STEALTH ELITES OPEN FIRE

Mayhem

As the fire from the encircled MARINES hits the ELITES it
disrupts their CAMOUFLAGE ARMOR - revealing their true shapes
in flickering strobes

Some of the ELITES are shot down before they reach the circle

- but others are not Once in the MARINES are cut to pieces
by the energy swords Worse as they try to shoot the only
sporadically visible enemy their wild arcs of fire cut into
their own men

MASTER CHIEF switches to melee tactics - grabbing the ENERGY
SWORD from a fallen ELITE and wielding it himself

The combat is up close and personal
Blue blood mixes with red
And when it is over among the bodies of the Covenant

another eleven of his MARINE squad lie dead Leaving him
with only nineteen - half of which are badly wounded
Q

74

INT HALOHUB

MASTER CHIEF looks at one of the surviving soldiers standing
over the corpse of a dead ELITE

CORPORAL JENKINS
How’s it feel to be dead

then down towards the bodies of the fallen MARINES

His thoughts are unreadable

CORTANA
Chief

MASTER CHIEF
How close are we to the Map Room

CORTANA
It’s three hundred metres down the
passage ahead of you

MASTER CHIEF
Are you reading more Covenant
chatter on the transcom

CORTANA
Plenty

MASTER CHIEF nods Then beckons the SERGEANT over

MASTER CHIEF
Sergeant Pick one of these
passages Defend the opening
Tend the wounded And hold
position there

SERGEANT

MASTER CHIEF
I’m going on alone

INT HALOBENEATH PILLAR OF AUTUMN CRASH-SITEANTI-CHAMBER

Meanwhile CAPTAIN KEYES MAJOR SILVA and the HELLJUMPERS are
also apparently in the aftermath of their own battle

Their environment is also subterranean and cavernous but
very different to that of MASTER CHIEF and his MARINES

Its darker Much darker Almost PITCH BLACK -— the primary
source of illumination comes from their own FLASHLIGHTS
whose powerful beams crisscross the area

See

- lighting up the twisted bodies of numerous COVENANT

Silence
Then

MAJOR SILVA
What do you think killed them

Only now do we realize that this is not the aftermath of
their battle

KEYES is kneeling down beside one of the dead Covenant - a
JACKAL whose chest and innards have been opened up and
spread like an unpacked bag

CAPTAIN KEYES
Major I have no idea

‘Some HELLJUMPERS looks down at another ELITE

HELLJUMPER
Check it out

HELLJUMPER
Something scrambled his insides
pretty good

HELLJUMPER
Copy that

CAPTAIN KEYES stands and heads over to a HELLJUUMPER who is
working on the panel to a large closed door

CAPTAIN KEYES
How you getting on soldier

HELLJUMPER
Looks like the Covenant worked
pretty hard to lock it down But
I’ve almost got it
(steps back)
There

The LARGE DOOR slides open

INT HALOBENEATH PILLAR OF AUTUMN CRASH-SITECHAMBER

CAPTAIN KEYES MAJOR SILVA and the HELLJUMPERS enter an even
more cavernous space than the one they just left

Here their FLASHLIGHTS hardly seem to contact the far wall
HELLJUMPER
Dios mio I got a bad feeling
about this
MAJOR SILVA

Stow it Mendoza Youve always
got a bad feeling about something

AT THAT MOMENT -

A noise from somewhere in the darkness
A scuttling Or slithering

All beams sweep in that area And find -
Nothing

Now a noise from the OTHER direction and the beams sweep
again

And again find nothing
HELLJUMPER
Major Im telling you this
feeling is real bad
NOW CUT BACK TO -
Some distance from the group of SPECIAL FORCES

We can see them a little pocket of light in the otherwise
huge dark space

A beat

Then SUDDENLY the SLITHERING SCUTTLING sound is right
beside us In our ear

And the next moment we start to MOVE towards the group of
special forces covering the distance at amazing speed

And as we are within twenty metres the beams sweep towards
us -
Soeee

Blinding and illuminating us -

And we see the soldiers open fire -

And then the fear on their faces -

But we continue towards them at the same breakneck speed -

CLOSING IN on the face of CAPTAIN KEYES eyes bulging as he
blazes his assault rifle -

INTO his EYES -
Then CUT TO -
A RAPID-FIRE SEQUENCE OF IMAGES

These are memories of CAPTAIN KEYES each image presented in
only the fraction of a second as seen through his eyes

A woman a young girl (his daughter Miranda) a gun a
covenant soldier on a dissecting table twin suns the face
of Master Chief the bridge of the Pillar of Autumn the

Jackal he shot in the head the face of the Black Elite
torturer and finally an image of the FLOOD FORMS

CAPTAIN KEYES
Oh God

CAPTAIN KEYES
Oh God No

INT HALOOUTSIDE THE MAP ROOM

MASTER CHIEF stands on a slender glass walkway beneath which
one of HALO’S interior chasms drops away into darkness

The barrel of his assault rifle is smoking Lying on the
walkway are the bodies of four ELITES

CORTANA
That’s it Straight ahead

MASTER CHIEF looks up to where she indicates - a large
spherical chamber
Some”

pase”

The means of its support over the chasm are unclear - perhaps
it is simply the glass walkway that keeps it from falling
into the abyss

INT HALOMAP ROOM

MASTER CHIEF is at the entrance to the MAP ROOM

CORTANA
The Silent Cartographer
(beat)
Wow

She manifests in front of MASTER CHIEF and steps inside
Now reveal what they see

The glass walkway ends in a simple-looking console panel
Beyond the panel we can see that the Map Room is nothing
more than a spherical black space

But in the middle of that black space is HALO

Not a scale model exactly - more like the real thing Waves
lap on the shores cloud-formations roll and cluster wind
pushes through trees Just in miniature

CORTANA
These Forerunners had truly amazing
technology at their disposal Puts
my holographic version to shame
doesn’t it

MASTER CHIEF
Somewhat

CORTANA
Okay Give me a few moments to
access the

She breaks off - with a gasp as if she has just plunged into
icy water

The hologram of her FREEZES Eyebrows raised mouth slightly
parted in surprise

A moment later DATA starts to scroll across her skin like
animated light tatoos

MASTER CHIEF
Cortana

A moment later she abruptly unfreezes

CORTANA
(quiet awestruck)
Chief It’s

Cortana does something we haven’t seen her do before she
LAUGHS

CORTANA
- glorious

MASTER CHIEF is slightly thrown by this response

MASTER CHIEF
Can you find the Control
Center

CORTANA
(blank)
The Control Center
(remembering)
Yes The Control Center Of

course

Then she is distracted by something As if hearing an inner
voice

CORTANA
(smiles distantly)
Oh Surprising

She indicates the console in front of them

CORTANA
I can hard-dock there Place my
chip in the receptacle

MASTER CHIEF hesitates There’s definitely something
worrying about her manner - almost giddy Drunk

CORTANA
What are you waiting for

MASTER CHIEF
I‘m not a hundred percent on
this

Another uncharacteristic response flashes across CORTANA’S
face ANGER
Sesame”

ae

CORTANA
Not a hundred percent When
precisely did you turn from a
killing machine into a
probabilities analyst

MASTER CHIEF
Youre acting strange

CORTANA
(steel)
I have just brushed against a
system more complex than your
barbarian mind can conceive I am
unable to explore it fully without
a hard dock

At the word ‘barbarian’ MASTER CHIEF noticeably reacts -
head inclining with surprise But the expression behind his
visor is unseen and he replies with calm control in his
voice

MASTER CHIEF
If I plug you in I don’t know what
its going to do to you

CORTANA
You don’t need to know what it’s
going to do to me
(viciously echoing Major
Silva)
You dont need to know shit

A moment between the two of them A sense that CORTANA has
crossed some kind of line

MASTER CHIEF reaches to the port behind his neck and pulls
out the CORTANA CHIP

Her holographic form vanishes at once

MASTER CHIEF looks at the small chip in his massive palm for
a couple of beats - then inserts it into the console

At first nothing happens

Then the ENTIRE room suddenly lights up And CORTANA’S FACE
appears as a projection wrapped around on the inside of the
MAP ROOM SPHERE encompassing both HALO and MASTER CHIEF

Her expression is pure rapture

CORTANA
Chief I wish you could feel this
You can’t imagine the wealth of
information So much So fast
As she talks her voice is rising and the flood of DATA
across her features is moving and flickering so fast that it
has become liquid

MASTER CHIEF is backing away The light levels in the room
are rising dramatically

CORTANA
Amazing Extraordinary The
Covenant are correct - the
Forerunners are Gods I can see it
now Whoever controls Halo -
The light levels are almost blinding
CORTANA
- controls the fate of the
universe
With that suddenly the room bleaches white

In the glow we just glimpse MASTER CHIEF doubled up against
the glare

Then he is consumed too

FADE TO -

MASTER CHIEFS DREAM

MASTER CHIEF without helmet stands in the landscape we have
seen before

But this time it is different

The bodies are gone

And instead of the twin suns burning the sky
- there is HALO

MASTER CHIEF
Cortana

Silence

MASTER CHIEF
(calls out)
Cortana
No reply

But instead from somewhere not far the sound of sobbing

MASTER CHIEFS DREAMRUINED CITY

MASTER CHIEF tracks the source of the sobbing through a
ruined city

And again although we have seen this landscape of before -
the buildings reduced to rock and dust the twisted steel
skeletons - something about it is different

There seems to be a strange and alien form of PLANT-LIFE
growing out of the ruins Vines tendrils pushing out of
rubble wrapping around the jutting girders

What is doubly strange about the plant-life is that it seems
to be moving

Always in the peripheral vision there is the sense that the
vines and tendrils are subtly curling sliding tightening
But this effect is never seen explicitly

MASTER CHIEF pauses on his search through the devastated
city Listens

Hes getting close
The sound is coming from the remnants of a low structure

MASTER CHIEF climbs through the gap in a wall created by
heavy artillery

Inside the roof is riddled with thousands of bullet holes
and bright sunshine lances through them speckling the floor
like a constellation

And there in the dappled light in the corner is a MAN
Curled up in the fragments of stone and concrete

A moment
Then the MAN looks up

MASTER CHIEF is amazed to recognize CAPTAIN KEYES

Red-eyed shaking tears cutting though the dust on his face
His expression is locked in a rictus of misery and horror

Even under Covenant torture he was nothing like as broken
As destroyed

And looking closer we see the same plant-like tendrils that
pushed through the rubble outside

But these have wrapped themselves around his feet as if
rooting him to the ground And they are snaking into his
clothing Almost imperceptibly creeping up and around his
neck

CAPTAIN KEYES
Please Kill me Make it stop

cur TO

INT HALOOUTSIDE THE MAP ROOM

MASTER CHIEF is lying flat on his back on the glass walkway
to the MAP ROOM

He stirs coming back from unconsciousness

Dazed he sits up

and sees to his dismay that the sphere of the MAP ROOM
is gone - apparently destroyed in the explosion that blasted
MASTER CHIEF back onto the walkway

MASTER CHIEF jumps to his feet

At the end of the walkway the console into which he inserted
the CORTANA CHIP is still there

He goes over quickly and pulls the chip out
It is dead Lifeless and light-less
He jams it into the back of his suit

MASTER CHIEF
Cortana

Nothing

Enraged his armored fist swings down and SMASHES the
console

Pointless

And he knows it

MASTER CHIEF
(quiet)
Shit

Then MASTER CHIEF turns and leaves the MAP ROOM AREA heading
back towards the HUB where he left the MARINES

but we remain behind

For a while there is silence Then through the quiet we
hear

a HUMMING

Not the hum of distant engines and machinery - a MUSICAL
humming Almost absent-minded unconcerned - the sound
someone might make as they go about a benign task

The noise gets louder

By the way it echoes we can tell it is coming from the black
abyss beneath the walkway

And from the abyss comes a gathering bluish glow

But we CUT AWAY before the person or thing arrives

INT HALOHUB

MASTER CHIEF re-enters the HUB - the location of the battle
with the CAMOUFLAGE ELITES

The bodies are still there - the dead MARINES and COVENANT
lying where they fell

What are absent however are the living MARINES
MASTER CHIEF looks around confused

MASTER CHIEF
Sergeant this is Master Chief over
the transcom Why are you not in
position Over

No response
MASTER CHIEF

Are you reading me Please
respond Over

INT HALOPASSAGEWAY ENTRANCE

MASTER CHIEF examines the passage entrance where the SERGEANT
was ordered to hold position

There is blood is still on the floor and the blood is still
wet There are spent MED KITS everywhere And also

a large number of magazine casings
MASTER CHIEF picks one of them up and examines it
Its empty They’re all empty
MASTER CHIEF
(under his breath)
This is not good

AT THAT MOMENT -
There is a sound from further down the PASSAGE WAY
MASTER CHIEFS head snaps around assault rifle raised

and sees a few junctions down from where he stands a
single MARINE run across the passage from left to right

MASTER CHIEF
Marine

Too late The man is gone the passageway is empty again
Keeping his assault rifle up MASTER CHIEF moves cautiously

down to investigate

INT HALOPASSAGEWAY

MASTER CHIEF rounds the junction corner where the MARINE
appeared to run into

This off-shoot is darker
“seegee

MASTER CHIEF switches on his head-mounted FLASHLIGHT

illuminating a ramp leading down

INT HALOLOWER LEVELSTRENCH CHAMBER

MASTER CHIEF has entered a lower network of subterranean
Halo

The architecture here is different The look is less

designed built with less of an eye on the aesthetic It has
the feel of a basement complex - where you might expect to
find the guts of the machinery above the circulation ducts
and the power conduits

The floor dips into a trench as if it may once have held
liquid on the far side of the trench a pneumatic door
opens and shuts - the mechanism presumably broken

MASTER CHIEF scans

The chamber is empty

He presses on

INT HALOLOWER LEVELS PASSAGE

In a narrow passage MASTER CHIEF turns a corner sweeping
his assault rifle in precise unison with the sweep of his
FLASHLIGHT

and illuminates up pushed as far as he can into the
shadows of a corner

It’s MARINE CORPORAL JENKINS

His face is blood-streaked his eyes are bulging Hes
frozen in the glare of MASTER CHIEFS flashlight like a

rabbit in headlights

MASTER CHIEF
Soldier - what the Hell is going
on Didn’t you hear me over the
transcom Where’s the rest of your
squad

CORPORAL JENKINS
(shivering almost
uncontrollably)

You still got it You still got my
M6D
cage”

Beat
MASTER CHIEF
I’ve got it Where’s your assault
rifle
CORPORAL JENKINS
Lost Running Need my M6D Give
it back
MASTER CHIEF
Running from what
CORPORAL JENKINS
Need my gun
MASTER CHIEF
Running from what soldier
CORPORAL JENKINS
(with fear-crazed
authority)
I need My fucking Gun -
A beat

Then MASTER CHIEF reaches down to his hip and pulls out his
M6D pistol and hands it to the soldier grip first

CORPORAL JENKINS grabs it out of MASTER CHIEF’S hand
- jams it straight into his mouth -

- and blows his brains out right up the wall behind

If we could see MASTER CHIEF’S face it would be stunned
But we can’t All we can see is the reflection in his blood-
flecked visor as the dead soldier slides down the wall to
the floor

Silence

Then through it

A SLITHERING NOISE

MASTER CHIEF turns - listening

We know this sound We heard it when the HELLJUMPERS and
CAPTAIN KEYES were taken

And it’s getting louder

Not just louder but broader Larger The sense of
gathering scale that a breaking wave has as it starts to
tumble rushing towards a beach

Its coming from the direction that MASTER CHIEF just came
from

He starts to back away

INT HALOLOWER LEVELSCHAMBER

MASTER CHIEF backs into a large room

Irregular angular walls Heavy buttresses Grey metal
None of the intricate etched Forerunner patterns that are
found on the higher levels This place is dark and cold

And its a dead end

MASTER CHIEF keeps backing away assault rifle trained on the
door he just came through scanning quickly over his shoulder
for cover

But there is none

And the sound of the breaking wave is reaching a crescendo

Whatever is coming is nearly here

And at the moment MASTER CHIEFS back hits the far wall and

‘he realizes he has nowhere left to go

» the wave breaks
GUSHING through the door come the FLOOD INFECTION FORMS

Each the size of a football bloated propelled by a seething
carpet of small tentacles on the underside on the underside
of its main form Gliding across the floor up the walls

There are literally hundreds of them

MASTER CHIEF opens fire - with devastating result

When shot each vessel pops like a balloon releasing a cloud
of greenish spore particles Moreover the explosion of the

vessel is of sufficient force to explode another vessel in
close proximity

Meaning that a spray of bullets obliterates a large number
Easy to kill
Sngee”

except that they just KEEP COMING Where a hundred die
a hundred more appear

The barrel of MASTER CHIEF’S gun is soon glowing a dull red
from the constant discharge of rounds

Initially reloading is his biggest problem

But this gives way to another he’s running out of ammo The
next clip he jams into his assault rifle is his last

The WAVE of INFECTION VESSELS is now effectively breaking
over him He is surrounded by the greenish explosions being
showered by torn flesh

But just as it looks like he’s done for and the digital
readout on his assault rifle races down to zero and the last
bullet is spent

the greenish spore-cloud starts to clear By miraculous
stroke of luck the end of his ammo supply has coincided with
the end of the supply of INFECTION VESSELS

There is just one left
scuttling across the room towards him

He reaches for his pistol -

- but the holster is EMPTY The M6D is in the hand of the
suicidal JENKINS

The INFECTION VESSELS propels itself up - flying towards
MASTER CHIEFS face

Instinctively he reaches out and CATCHES it in one hand
The bloated creature wriggles in his grip

MASTER CHIEF
What are you

Then he squeezes his fist - and the creature explodes

A moment as MASTER CHIEF gazes at the remnants of the
INFECTION VESSEL in his hand

Then -
- he seems to sense that he is not alone

He looks up

Out of the chamber door figures are appearing

Even through the haze of green spores that still hangs in the
air they are recognizable as MARINES

But there is something deeply weird about them Their
postures are somehow broken - a shoulder hangs down as if the
collar bone is snapped a head lists sideways as if the neck
tendons are torn

From some something long and ragged hangs from their arms
But not clothing Whatever it is it is moving
Independently Writhing Squirming

And to cap it all they are armed

MASTER CHIEF
(under his breath)
Damn

MASTER CHIEF has not been quite as lucky with his ammunition
as it seemed This battle isn’t over yet

A moment later the INFECTED MARINES ATTACK

TWO leap forward bounding with inhuman strength towards
MASTER CHIEF

MASTER CHIEF is struck - and sent flying

As he picks himself up he is knocked sideways by a blast of
fire from an INFECTED MARINE holding an assault rifle

As he staggers under the impact of the rounds his shield is
worked down to zero point -

— and there is a SPURT OF BLOOD from his LEFT LEG as a bullet
finds a path through the protective armor plates

He falls sideways against the wall then looks round to
see

the deranged and ravaged face of an INFECTED MARINE
This INFECTED MARINE is holding a piece of COVENANT WEAPONRY
the NEEDLER

Now MASTER CHIEF has an opportunity He grabs the INFECTED
MARINE and pulls him forwards - acting as a shield as another
burst of automatic rifle fire cuts into the Flood creatures
back

Simultaneously MASTER CHIEF has his hand on the NEEDLER He
bends the creature’s hand back on itself and squeezes the
trigger

At point-blank range the stomach of the INFECTED MARINE
fills with the pink shards - and as they reach maximum
cluster they DETONATE

The INFECTED MARINE is blown in two
MASTER CHIEF is blown backwards
He hits the floor rolling to a standing position to face -

- another weapon-wielding INFECTED MARINE this one holding a
PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUN

In one movement of pure training MASTER CHIEF grabs the
barrel twists it anti-clockwise breaking the INFECTED
MARINE’S wrist and twisting the weapon free

then spins it back into his own grasp
And fires

The INFECTED MARINE flies backwards

MASTER CHIEF has found the perfect tool for the INFECTED
forms

He turns and starts blazing Each compressed scatter-blast
drops a target

Six cartridges expended and the room finally is emptied

INT HALOLOWER LEVELSPASSAGE

MASTER CHIEF crouches by the corpse of the SUICIDAL MARINE
First things first - he gets his M6D back

Second things second - from the Marine’s belt he pulls a MED
KIT

Then he pulls back a section of armor around his thigh
Beneath we can see a bullet wound in the snow-white flesh of
his side welling blood

MASTER CHIEF takes a dressing jams it on and pushes back
the armor section
Sone”

vee”

INT HALOLOWER LEVELSTRENCH CHAMBER

MASTER CHIEF gazes through a slit of open door into the
TRENCH CHAMBER

and sees that the room is full of the FLOOD

Both infected MARINES and COVENANT not to mention
innumerable seething VESSELS

The INFECTED ELITES make a particularly disturbing sight -
with their necks snapped heads lolling down their backs and
a tumorous mass erupting from their upper chest

They all are unaware of MASTER CHIEF‘S presence and moving
slowly shifting as if waiting for a trigger command

There is absolutely no way MASTER CHIEF is going to survive
this fight

But there is absolutely no way out except through them
MASTER CHIEF
(quiet)
Cortana - where are you when I need
you
And as if in reply
we hear something odd Something we have heard before
The musical unconcerned HUMMING
And a few moments later dropping through a VENT in the

ceiling of the TRENCH CHAMBER the source of the humming
appears

It is a FLOATING ROBOTIC DEVICE - simply a single blue ‘eye’
in a spherical metal double-casing

FLOATING ROBOTIC DEVICE
Hmmm—hmm—hmmm

It flies as if carried on its own private air-currents
swooping down to investigate the FLOOD - who show no interest
in the non-organic form

FLOATING ROBOTIC DEVICE
Ah yes You can see perfectly how
the body has been transformed by
the Flood infection
Ngee

Its voice like its humming is pleasant and cheery - in an
off-beat way

ECTION VESSELS

It moves over to a cluster of INF

FLOATING ROBOTIC DEVICE
The small creatures carry spores
that cause a host to mutate The
mutated host then produces spores
that pass the Flood to others It
is insidious and elegant As long
as any hosts remain the Flood is

virulent

Then SUDDENLY —-

- it turns on its axis to DIRECTLY face the sliver of open

doorway behind which MASTER CHIEF is hiding

FLOATING ROBOTIC DEVICE
Are you paying attention I hope
are

MASTER CHIEF jolts

Then ducks back around the doorframe

INT HALOLOWER LEVELSPASSAGE

A moment later the FLOATING ROBOTIC DEVICE appears through
the doorway

MASTER CHIEF backs away

FLOATING ROBOTIC DEVICE
Greetings

MASTER CHIEF
(whispers raising
shotgun)
Back off

FLOATING ROBOTIC DEVICE
Please lower your primitive weapon
It is not remotely sufficient to
penetrate my armor

MASTER CHIEF

(whispers )
Keep it down Are you trying to
get me killed

FLOATING ROBOTIC DEVICE
On the contrary I require your
assistance Just as you require
mine

CUT BACK TO

INT HALOLOWER LEVELSTRENCH CHAMBER

Out of the same vent that the FLOATING ROBOTIC DEVICE
appeared several more appear But these are shaped
differently - they are triangular predatory hawk-like

SENTINELS

They immediately open fire on the FLOOD below with precise
sweeping LASERS Under attack the FLOOD returns fire - and
although two of the SENTINELS are brought down it is the
FLOOD on the losing side

In fifteen seconds of slaughter it is over

The FLOATING ROBOTIC DEVICE enters the TRENCH CHAMBER
followed by MASTER CHIEF

343 GUILTY SPARK
Let me introduce myself I am the
monitor of installation zero-four
I am 343 Guilty Spark Someone has
released the Flood My function is
to prevent it from leaving this
installation

As GUILTY SPARK talks MASTER CHIEF uses the opportunity to
rearm himself from the dead FLOOD - taking shotgun shells and
assault rifle clips

343 GUILTY SPARK
In order to do that you will have
to follow me These Sentinels will
cover our escape

MASTER CHIEF
Where do you want me to go

343 GUILTY SPARK
To the Control Room of course

At this MASTER CHIEF reacts He turns to face the Monitor
Beat

MASTER CHIEF
The Control Room The Control
Room of Halo

343 GUILTY SPARK
Yes

MASTER CHIEF
And when we get there youre
going to show me how to use it

343 GUILTY SPARK
Naturally What odd questions you
ask

MASTER CHIEF slips a last shell into his shotgun and primes
the chamber

MASTER CHIEF
Lead the way

INT HALOELEVATOR PLATFORM

MASTER CHIEF rides in the center of a colossal elevator
platform which is moving slowly upwards

The Monitor floats a few feet above his head

343 GUILTY SPARK
The installation was specifically
built to contain and study the
Flood

MASTER CHIEF
« Halo is a laboratory

343 GUILTY SPARK
In a sense But it was also a
means to ensure the survival of the
race There was no desire to
eradicate the Flood The desire
was to prevent it from eradicating
everything else

The Monitor sighs perhaps regretfully

343 GUILTY SPARK
But it now seems that decision may

have been an error
(MORE )
seer

343 GUILTY SPARK (contd)
Which is why it is fortunate that
sterilization protocols still
remain in place

With a clunk of vast machinery cogs slotting into place the
ELEVATOR stops

343 GUILTY SPARK
Ah Here we are

INT HALOTHE LIBRARYGREAT CHAMBER

MASTER CHIEF enters into another new environment The scale
of the entire installation has been large but this is a new
set of dimensions altogether The ceilings must be fifty
metres high

A soft blue glow illuminates buttresses that look as if they
might be made of concrete polished to a smooth but matt
surface Out of the walls tall oxygen vents jut out from
which vapor gently rolls And on the walls holograms are
projected - images of arcane circuitry flickering rotating
and rearranging themselves

MASTER CHIEF
What is this place

343 GUILTY SPARK
It is the Library The
installation’s research facilities
are most impressive Perhaps you
will have time to see them later

MASTER CHIEF
Just get me to the Control Room

343 GUILTY SPARK
It is located in the Librarys
core And I am in as much of a
hurry to reach it as you Please
follow me

The Monitor accelerates away from MASTER CHIEF dancing on

the invisible air currents like a ghost or a firefly Its
tinkling laugh is swallowed into the cavernous space

INT HALOTHE LIBRARYSECURITY DOOR

MASTER CHIEF stands by a colossal metal iris - which is
closed

The Monitor swoops down to hover by MASTER CHIEF’S face
“sae”

343 GUILTY SPARK
An unfortunate turn of events The
Sentinels have been overwhelmed by
the Flood Large numbers of
infected beings are now entering
the Library facility from muitiple
access points Even as we speak

MASTER CHIEF
Then what the Hell are we speaking
for Let’s move

343 GUILTY SPARK
Unfortunately the presence of the
Flood has caused the security doors
to seal automatically I will go
to access the override to open
them Wait here until I return

MASTER CHIEF
Youre leaving me

The Monitor answers by soaring up again then vanishing
somewhere into the higher recesses of the Library space

MASTER CHIEF is alone

He turns from the closed security door and looks back in the
direction he has just come

It is a passage wide enough to drive a tank down Like the
GREAT CHAMBER the lighting is a diffused blue But here
this glow comes partly from large panels set into the sloping
walls

Behind some of these panels a back-lit cobalt liquid churns -
coolant perhaps for the Library’s computer system Behind
others a scattered light array against blackness looks like
star constellations in a night sky

MASTER CHIEF takes a few steps forwards away from the door
in the direction from which he came

A different sound under his boots makes him look down

He has stepped onto a section of glass flooring beneath
which a pit drops into darkness

He gazes into the abyss a few moments
Then looks up again

And freezes

At the FAR END of the Library passage

the FLOOD ARMY has appeared

INT HALOTHE LIBRARY PASSAGE

What follows is a vision of Hell
The combat ig more extreme than ANYTHING we have seen so far

Tt is both BALLETIC and FRENZIED It is HYPNOTIC in its
intensity

At first simply the FLOOD ARMY charge

And as they are charging more are pouring from the huge
vapor-spilling vents

And INFECTION VESSELS are dropping from the ceiling like
rain

MASTER CHIEF starts firing

Switching between fluidly between weapons
Releasing clips and jamming in new ones
Throwing plasma and fragmentation grenades

FLOOD CARRIERS bloated bodies of GRUNTS explode under the
pressure of their own gas-forms

As the FLOOD ARMY reaches the floor panels MASTER CHIEF
shoots the glass away shattering them

INFECTED MARINES and INFECTED COVENANT tumble into the abyss
while others leap the gap flailing tentacle arms

MASTER CHIEF has backed up against the SECURITY DOOR
Nowhere left to go

And here at close quarters the combat becomes TRANSCENDENT

In a mist of blood and green spore clouds time seems to
DISTORT to slow at some moments to speed up at others -—

- as we witness combat not through MASTER CHIEFS eyes but
in synch with his PERCEPTION His reflexes instincts His
anticipation His READING of the flow of battle

It is a display of precisely what makes him the soldier he
is
Sox

Now building through the crescendo of the battle the
detonations and gunfire -

- a noise starts to rise
A roar A kind of scream
Until as the sound of the fighting starts to subside and

the last FLOOD SOLDIERS are blown apart with the shotgun or
shredded with the assault rifle

« we realize that the sound is MASTER CHIEF

Howling

Until the howl is the only noise that remains

Then it too ceases

And MASTER CHIEF stands in a sea of bodies in silence
A beat

Another beat

Then behind him the iris of the huge SECURITY DOOR starts to
open

and the GUILTY SPARK flies through

343 GUILTY SPARK
Hmmm—hmm

It breaks off

343 GUILTY SPARK
There you are
(it turns back on itself
and flies away)
Do stay close Time is short

INT HALOCONTROL ROOM

CLOSE UP on MASTER CHIEF’S VISOR
Reflecting white light and stabs of color

343 GUILTY SPARK
Ah Were here

REVEAL now the heart of the great Forerunner construction

It is like being inside a mind

A bright space in which synapse sparks race along the walls
even through the air

And in the center of the room is a CONSOLE
MASTER CHIEF follows the Monitor towards it

343 GUILTY SPARK
Unfortunately my usefulness in
this endeavour has now come to an
end Protocol does not allow a
unit of my classification to
perform a task as important as the
activation sequence That final
task is reserved for you

MASTER CHIEF stands by the CONSOLE

MASTER CHIEF
What do I do

343 GUILTY SPARK
Everything is in place Simply
place your hand on the reader so
that your sentient organic status
can be confirmed Then
sterilization will begin

MASTER CHIEF looks down at the reader - but makes no move

343 GUILTY SPARK
Please do not delay

Still MASTER CHIEF makes no move

343 GUILTY SPARK
I do not understand

MASTER CHIEF
Yeah You don’t

343 GUILTY SPARK
Please explain

MASTER CHIEF
I came here to destroy this weapon
to prevent it falling into the
hands of the Covenant And you
want me to use it

343 GUILTY SPARK
(splutters)
« To destroy it Impossible
Unthinkable Are you in any doubt
of the Flood’s virulent nature

The Monitor flies down to peer at MASTER CHIEF

343 GUILTY SPARK
I am aware that you are presently
involved in a war with the other
species on the installation Let
me assure you that your war is as
NOTHING in comparison to the
consequence of Flood expansion

343 GUILTY SPARK circles MASTER CHIEF in a state of high
agitation

343 GUILTY SPARK
The Flood absorbs the knowledge and
intelligence of all those forms it
occupies It will use your
spaceships and the spaceships of
your enemies It will spread
itself far and wide

The circling ceases right in front of MASTER CHIEFS face
343 GUILTY SPARK
Nothing will stop it No system
no planet no corner of the Galaxy
will be spared And once the

Galaxy is lost the universe will
follow

A moment on the Monitors BLUE EYE gazing into the implacable
reflective surface of MASTER CHIEF’S visor

Then suddenly the blue eye turns on its axis -

- to gaze at where MASTER CHIEF’S hand hovers above the
CONSOLE

A beat

Then MASTER CHIEF pushes DOWN

The sterilization has been triggered
343 GUILTY SPARK

Ah Youve done it Youve
activated the ring

Around the CONTROL ROOM the colored synapse sparks begin to
increase in speed and frequency

The Monitor gives its tinkling laugh

343 GUILTY SPARK
Excellent

INSERT a shot of the back of MASTER CHIEFS HEAD and
SHOULDERS as he looks up to see the display - and a FLICKER
OF ACTIVITY passes across the CORTANA CHIP

Meanwhile the sparks start to cluster and seethe in the very
center of the room above the CONSOLE As if they are
gathering themselves for a sudden outward expansion

MASTER CHIEF
This is going to kill me too isn’t
it

343 GUILTY SPARK
Oh yes Absolutely
Then something unexpected happens
The Sparks abruptly coalesce
into a humanoid form

MASTER CHIEF
Cortana

343 GUILTY SPARK
Odd That wasn’t supposed to
happen

CORTANA
And I imagine this wasn’t either

A bolt of energy flies from her and strikes the Monitor full
on - sending the silvery ball spinning and crashing down to
the Control Room floor

MASTER CHIEF
Cortana wait Hes on our side

CORTANA
On our side On our SIDE Do you
have any idea what he almost made
you do

MASTER CHIEF
Yes Activate Halo’s defenses and
destroy the Flood

CORTANA
You have no idea how this ring
works Why the Forerunners built
it

The Monitor picks itself up hovering a little dazed but
still indignant

CORTANA
Halo doesn’t kill the Flood - it
kills their food Us

A guilty silence from the GUILTY SPARK

CORTANA
Left out that little detail did
your

MASTER CHIEF
Is this true

343 GUILTY SPARK
More or less This installation’s
pulse has an effective range of
twenty five thousand light years
All sentient life within that
radius would be sterilized

CORTANA

Sterilized’

(to Master Chief)
Every man woman and child Earth
our colonies our entire race our
entire history - all would be
annihilated Not to mention any
other species caught in the net

343 GUILTY SPARK
Your arguments are pointless
Sterilization is the only certain
means to contain a Flood release
The Flood is released Ergo we
must activate the ring

CORTANA
If we activate the ring everything
is pointless
(to Master Chief)
There has to be another way
“ange

MASTER CHIEF responds by reaching out and grabbing the
Monitor

Then at point blank range he jams the shotgun into the blue
eye and fires

The light behind the blue eyes winks out and the force of
the scatter-shot sends the spherical construct skidding back

along the floor

MASTER CHIEF
Agreed

INT HALOELEVATOR DISC

MASTER CHIEF and CORTANA ride an elevator disc to the surface
of Halo CORTANA is in manifested form

MASTER CHIEF
So what happened to you Where
were you all that time

CORTANA
It‘s hard to explain

MASTER CHIEF
To a barbarian

CORTANA Looks ashamed

CORTANA
The complexity of the Forerunner
system was intoxicating It pulled
me in and for a while
(beat)
« I was lost

A moment between them CORTANA has something she wants to
say but doesn’t seem to know how to put it

Then abruptly

CORTANA
Chief - I owe you an apology You
were right to try to stop me And
what I said it was wrong You’re
not a barbarian at all You’re a
warrior Probably the finest
warrior I ever -

MASTER CHIEF
(cuts in)
Cortana You seem to be worried
that you hurt my feelings

A beat showing MASTER CHIEF’S massive armored frame which
dwarfs the slight and ethereal form of CORTANA

Nothing is given away through the reflection of MASTER
CHIEFS visor but if we could see behind it his lips might
show the barest curl of quiet amusement

MASTER CHIEF
You can relax about that

Another beat

MASTER CHIEF
Anyway you just saved all life in
the Galaxy from extinction Let’s
call it quits

CORTANA composes herself
CORTANA

The Galaxy isn’t saved yet We
just bought it a little time

INT HALOCONTROL ROOM

CLOSE UP on the Monitor
as the blue light reignites in his eye

343 GUILTY SPARK
Not acceptable

He floats upwards

343 GUILTY SPARK
No no no Not acceptable at all

EXT HALOMOUNTAIN TOP DAY - SNOW

MASTER CHIEF and CORTANA exit on to a metal platform high up
a sheer cliff-face They have a stunning view across HALO

In the far distance we can see the PILLAR OF AUTUMN crash-
site and beyond it the ring beginning its upward curve

But perhaps the most amazing aspect of the view is that it’s
SNOWING The whole landscape is covered in a white blanket
and seen through a gauze of falling snowflakes

CORTANA
Halo’s environment systems are
malfunctioning It must be a
consequence of Flood activity

MASTER CHIEF stands without speaking for a few moments
gazing down at the landscape beneath him

MASTER CHIEF
The battle-net is silent

CORTANA
While I was linked up to the
Forerunner network I could sense
the activity of the Flood The
base-camp was overrun
(beat)
They didn’t stand a chance

MASTER CHIEF
(quiet)
They’re all dead

CORTANA
No Chief Not quite all

And AT THAT MOMENT -
RISING from beneath the metal platform -
FOEHAMMER’S DROPSHIP APPEARS
FOEHAMMER
(over transcom)
I got your transmission Cortana

Good to hear your voice Have to
say it was getting lonely up here

EXT HALOVALLEY FLOOR - DAY SNOW

An encircled group of COVENANT are being overwhelmed by the
FLOOD

In the epicenter of the battle we see for the first time the
PROCESS OF INFECTION as an ELITE’S plasma rifle overheats
and he is swarmed by the INFECTION VESSELS
Sete”

One of them attaches itself to his neck His head is
VIOLENTLY SNAPPED BACKWARDS - then the creature burrows into
him ballooning out his upper torso

OVER THIS —
FOEHAMMER’S DROPSHIP FLIES OVERHEAD only ten metres above

the ground with MASTER CHIEF standing in the open hatch
gazing down at the carnage beneath him

INT FOEHAMMER’S PELICAN DROPSHIP - DAY - SNOW

MASTER CHIEF enters FOEHAMMER’S cockpit with CORTANA

MASTER CHIEF
Appreciate you still being alive
Foehammer

FORHAMMER
Likewise

She banks her ship around one of HALO’S skyward metal spires

MASTER CHIEF
Any other dropships make it

FOEHAMMER
Negative We tried to evac the
base The others didn’t even make
it off the ground I got five or
six Marines into the back of mine
but I guess one of them was
infected Looked over my shoulder
after dust-off and

She breaks off

FOEHAMMER
I don’t know what happened to
those boys but it was some twisted
shit Figured I had no choice
Opened the bay doors wide and aimed
at the sky

FOEHAMMER shakes her head as if trying to rid it of the
memory

FOEHAMMER
Cortana - just tell me you have a
plan to wipe these bastards out
Scent

MASTER CHIEF
Second that

CORTANA

Okay This is what I’ve got The
Forerunner monitor was right about
one thing if the Flood escapes the
confines of Halo nothing short of
an apocalypse will stop it The
good news is so far it hasnt
escaped

MASTER CHIEF
So if we take out Halo

CORTANA
we’ll take out the Flood with
it It’s just a question of
triggering an explosion on a large
scale

FOEHAMMER
A cruiser’s fusion reactors going
critical is a pretty large scale

CORTANA
Indeed it is

MASTER CHIEF and FOEHAMMER exchange a look
FOEHAMMER banks the DROPSHIP
FOEHAMMER
Setting course for the Pillar of
Autumn
EXT HALOPILLAR OF AUTUMN - DAY - SNOW
The vast shape of the PILLAR OF AUTUMN lies where it crashed

Through the growing blizzard the silhouette of FOEHAMMERS
DROPSHIP materializes

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMNVENT

Through an open vent we can see the howling blizzard
outside

A beat — then MASTER CHIEFS hand appears at the opening to
the vent
Neagne

A moment later the rest of him appears as he hauls himself

up

MASTER CHIEF
(into transcom)
Okay Foehammer Were in

FOEHAMMER
(over transcom)
I’ll be waiting for you at the pick-
up point

CORTANA
If your sensors detect the core
going critical just get out of
here

FOEHAMMER
(over transcom)
Like I said See you at the pick-
up point

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMNCORRIDOR

MASTER CHIEF moves cautiously down a corridor

CORTANA
If the emergency lighting is on
there must still be some power in
the sub-systems I’11 be able to
set up a meltdown from the bridge

The PILLAR OF AUTUMN looks very different from the last time

we saw it

In the flicker of emergency lighting we can see that a fire
must have raged through the ship - everything is blackened
and scarred with smoke or plasma scorch-marks or bullet
indentations

CORTANA
(quiet)
I leave home for a few days and
look what happens

MASTER CHIEF
Why no welcome party

CORTANA

I don’t know I’ve got Covenant
message traffic everywhere and
from what they’re saying they’re
fighting tooth and nail with the
Flood Seems like all other parts
of the ship are a war-zone

(beat)
except this one

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMNBARRACKS

MASTER CHIEF enters a wide central passage - from which at
regularly spaced intervals smaller passages lead off

The smaller passages are lined with bunks They have entered
a BARRACKS

CORTANA
Look In the corners The Flood
are gathering bodies here

MASTER CHIEF checks down one of the side passages

As CORTANA indicated the cramped space is piled with the
bodies of MARINES Stacked on the floor spilling out of the
bunks a tangle of arms and legs and torn clothing

Then to our horror -
— we see that the bodies are moving

Except it is not precisely the bodies that are moving but
something under their skin - like the slow pulsing of
gigantic maggots

CORTANA
Oh no no

CORTANA manifests and approaches the nearest body crouching
beside it

The MARINE’S eyes are half open but sightless clouded as if
by cataracts Inside his mouth and nose blood has congealed
and dried black His skin is tinged with the unmistakable
shadows and colors of decay

MASTER CHIEF
Tell me
CORTANA
The flesh is necrotizing
rotting but they aren’t dead

MASTER CHIEF
These men are still alive

CORTANA
Their minds are The Flood won‘t
let them die - they’re being eaten
alive

CORTANA rests a holographic hand against the cheek of an
INFECTED MARINE

CORTANA
(quiet)
Chief - they’re in Hell

Behind CORTANA’S back we see MASTER CHIEF lift his assault

rifle

CORTANA
(without looking round)
Wait Don’t shoot

MASTER CHIEF holds fire

CORTANA
There’s another consciousness in
there with him it’s the Flood
(she shudders and closes
her eyes)
I can feel it now it’s trying to
reach into me into my mind

The data and impulses that scroll beneath CORTANA’S
translucent skin begin to change fluctuate randomize

CORTANA
No it’s pulling back Because
I’m non-organic
Her eyes open

CORTANA
Its moving on

She turns back to MASTER CHIEF

CORTANA
It knows we’re here now
A beat

MASTER CHIEF
Good

Then MASTER CHIEF opens’ £iré inté the MARINES - riddling them
with bullets putting them out of their Hellish misery

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMNCORRIDOR

MASTER CHIEF enters another corridor - this one filled dead
COVENANT Elites Grunts Jackals - sprawled in blue blood

MASTER CHIEF looks down at the corpse of a HUNTER

MASTER CHIEF
More bodies

- CORTANA
These are different Theyre lying
where they were killed in battle —

MASTER CHIEF
Not long ago by the looks of
things

“The evidence for MASTER CHIEFS statement is clear The

blood glistens still wet and plasma wounds still smoke
gently

MASTER CHIEF
But if the Flood knows were here
where is it

CORTANA
I don’t know

MASTER CHIEF steps over an ELITE

CORTANA
Its almost like it’s

MASTER CHIEF
(finishing her sentence)
cleared a way for us Yeah

Been thinking the same thing

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMNBRIDGE
MASTER CHIEF enters the BRIDGE As with the area he just
came through the flight deck is blackened and bears the
scars of the battle in which CAPTAIN KEYES was captured
Most of the flight deck instrumentation is smashed but
incredibly several of the monitors are still operational
Data streams appear intermittently through static
CORTANA manifests in front of MASTER CHIEF

CORTANA

(walking towards central

console)
Perfect It’s sufficiently intact

I‘1l be able to plant a
Suddenly she freezes
MASTER CHIEF follows her gaze to reveal
CAPTAIN KEYES

Standing in shadows but recognizable through his shape and
stance

Motionless
Watching them

MASTER CHIEF

oe Sir
CORTANA
No It’s not
(beat)
- him

CAPTAIN KEYES takes a step forwards and light from the
BRIDGE PORTAL falls against his face

His flesh is revealed

Although it has none of the tumors and traumas of the normal
Flood forms the skin is unmistakably colored with the greens
and blacks of decay

Silence

Then CORTANA speaks

CORTANA
- Who are you

And when the CAPTAIN replies his voice is layered as if
from many mouths and ambient

CAPTAIN KEYES
I am a monument to all your sins
I am the Flood

As KEYES says this tendrils begin unravelling from him

CAPTAIN KEYES
Across this universe new species
fall in and out of existence They
are born they prosper they pass
into extinction

The tendrils attach themselves to the walls and floor of the
BRIDGE

CAPTAIN KEYES
They leave nothing behind but dust
and echoes

CAPTAIN KEYES is soon in the center of a seething web
CAPTAIN KEYES
I outlive them all The life-span
of stars are my days My
containment within this prison has
been a single night

Now tumors are blossoming from his body expanding and
swelling Increasing his size massively

CAPTAIN KEYES
But you

His shape is becoming less recognizable as a human form - but
his face is still somehow present within the flux

CAPTAIN KEYES
»- would destroy me

cut To -
MASTER CHIEF’S VISOR reflecting the KEYES FORM

CAPTAIN KEYES
Why

Then pull back to REVEAL -

MASTER CHIEFS DREAM

ce

MASTER CHIEF CORTANA and KEYES are in exactly the same
positions relative to their positions on the BRIDGE except
now the backdrop landscape has changed to MASTER CHIEFS
DREAM

CORTANA
(disoriented)
What the -

CORTANA gathers herself as she realizes what is happening

CORTANA
Chief this is a hallucination
The Flood is telepathic - it’s just
reaching into your mind the same
way it did to mine It isn’t real

CAPTAIN KEYES
Isnt real

The KEYES FORM expands dramatically in size as if in measure
to its outrage

CAPTAIN KEYES
See’ Isn‘t REAL You are a computer
construct and you cannot
understand I am organic And I
understand that this is real

The gaze of the massive KEYES FORM lights on MASTER CHIEF

CAPTAIN KEYES
You Warrior You failed to
protect the people here

PULL BACK to reveal the bodies around them are not the
Spartans

- but the civilians of Planet Reach The bodies of men
the bodies of women and the bodies of children

CAPTAIN KEYES
Your failure is real Your pain is
real Your horror is real

CORTANA
Resist him Chief Fight it

CAPTAIN KEYES
Resist what I do not create this
landscape I share it

KEYES expands in size again
CAPTAIN KEYES
Understand what T am T collect
the memories of the sentient
Tendrils curls out and embrace MASTER CHIEF
CAPTAIN KEYES
Yours are fine memories warrior
They are of pain but they are

strong and true They should not
die with you

The tendrils snake around MASTER CHIEFS helmet
CAPTAIN KEYES

You need to know only this I

offer you immortality Your body

may rot away but your memories

will live on within me forever
AT THIS MOMENT —
CUT TO INSIDE MASTER CHIEF’S HELMET
An EXTREME CLOSE UP on MASTER CHIEF’S FACE
We are occupying the same space he does inside his suit
We see as a series of flash cuts
His SKIN His MOUTH His EYES
From this rapid patchwork of close-up images we can’t
assemble a likeness of Master Chief in our minds But what
we can see is that the face we saw in his dreams igs NO LONGER
the face he has
This face is marked with a fine mesh of scars suggesting
past injuries or surgical procedures or even experiments
His skin is a map of past conflict

A beat Then

On MASTER CHIEF’S MOUTH
age

“snr”

MASTER CHIEF
See that’s where you’re wrong
(beat)
I don‘t need to know shit

CUT BACK TO -

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMNBRIDGE

The hallucination shatters
MASTER CHTEF is back on the bridge

His MA5B assault rifle is raised and firing and he’s
emptying a full clip into KEYES

The tendrils that surround him fall away as his bullets rip
into the central mass of pulsating flesh

The FORM disintegrates exploding under the pressure of its
spore-filled tumors

As the spent clip drops from the assault rifle
the shreds of the KEYES FORM fall to the ground

MASTER CHIEF
» Is that it Is the Flood dead

CORTANA
Not even close While theres
still a single spore the Flood
remains
(beat)
But you killed that particular
vessel pretty good

MASTER CHIEF reaches down into the mess of organic matter and
mutated bone at his feet

» and pulls out the DOG-TAGS of CAPTAIN KEYES

He looks at the steel plates a moment imprinted with the
CAPTAIN’S name Then his fist closes around them

MASTER CHIEF
(quiet)
Yeah

Meanwhile CORTANA is working the console
Suddenly around MASTER CHIEF those monitors that are still
functioning all flick to the same display

A COUNTDOWN
Set at TEN MINUTES
« now reading 0959 0958 0957

CORTANA
Okay Ive started a reactor
cascade Weve got more than
enough time to make the RV and get
the Hell out of

From somewhere nearby a MUSICAL HUMMING

CORTANA
» here

A beat

CORTANA
Oh no

MASTER CHIEF and CORTANA both turn -
- to see the Monitor floating into the BRIDGE

343 GUILTY SPARK
(pleasant)
Hello

MASTER CHIEF
(under his breath)
Why is everything in this place so
hard to kill

343 GUILTY SPARK
First you refuse to trigger the
sterilization Now you attempt to
destroy the installation I am
shocked Almost too shocked for
words

As he speaks through the BRIDGE PORTAL one after another
SENTINELS appear
343 GUILTY SPARK

I suppose we are now beyond the
point of reasonable debate

MASTER CHIEF glances sideways at the COUNTDOWN
It now reads 0913

MASTER CHIEF
Agreed

343 GUILTY SPARK
Then you leave me no alternative
I will eliminate you and once your
construct is disabled I will be
able to stop your careless destruct
sequence
Over the Monitor’s tinkling laugh
the SENTINELS all open fire
LASER BEAMS blast through the BRIDGE PORTAL
- which shatters bringing in the outside BLIZZARD

aS MASTER CHIEF dives for cover

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMNCORRIDOR OUTSIDE BRIDGE

With a CRISSCROSS of LASERS lancing all around him MASTER
CHIEF rolls into the corridor which runs LEFT-RIGHT outside
the BRIDGE

He scrambles for cover behind the bulkhead at the side of the
doorway only JUST escaping their lethal sweep

Then as LASERS burn into the OPPOSITE WALL

CORTANA
Chief

MASTER CHIEF reloads his ASSAULT RIFLE and tosses a grenade
back into the BRIDGE

Through the detonation we can still hear the Monitor’s
laugh

CORTANA
(urgent)
Chief

MASTER CHIEF
What
Nee

CORTANA
Weve got a problem

Another blaze of LASERS rip through the doorway and a
SENTINEL floats through -

- to be BLASTED at POINT BLANK RANGE by MASTER CHIEFS
SHOTGUN

MASTER CHIEF
I know

CORTANA
No Not the Sentinels The Flood

A beat

MASTER CHIEF looks to his side and sees down the LEFT
corridor and all passages and access tunnels off it

- The FLOOD ARMY Infected MARINES and ELITES writhing
bounding rushing towards him

MASTER CHIEF looks RIGHT

And sees the FLOOD ARMY racing at him from the OTHER end of
the corridor too

A total trap With nowhere to go

MASTER CHIEF
Damn

CORTANA manifests directly in front of him

CORTANA
CHIEF THERE

She is pointing to his feet
MASTER CHIEF looks down He is standing on a PANEL

MASTER CHIEF fires three rapid rounds of the SHOTGUN between
his feet

The PANEL blasts open

» and with a MESH of fire coming in from left right and
behind

« MASTER CHIEF drops through the gaping hole into
darkness

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMNVENTILATION SYSTEM

MASTER CHIEF’S flashlight switches on to reveal that he is
sliding fast down a VENTILATION DUCT

Bouncing around tumbling
Sliding down past junctions
Then suddenly catapulted into
SUDDEN BRIGHTNESS

And THIN AIR

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMNVEHICLE STORAGE

MASTER CHIEF falls at least twenty metres

»- then lands hard

Picking himself up he looks around to see he is in a large
hanger lined with RECESSED DOORS

MASTER CHIEF
Where are we

CORTANA
Lower deck sub-section five

MASTER CHIEF
How long before the reactors blow

CORTANA
Not long enough Chief

A loaded beat

MASTER CHIEF
Okay Cortana Understood

MASTER CHIEF touches the side of his helmet to open his
TRANSCOM CHANNEL

MASTER CHIEF
Foehammer You reading me

FOEHAMMER
(over transcom)
Just about Chief

MASTER CHIEF
Time you got out of here

FOEHAMMER
(over transcom)
How so

MASTER CHIEF
Were not going to make the pick-up
point

FOEHAMMER
(over transcom)
Chief I thought you knew me by
now I don’t leave soldiers
behind

MASTER CHIEF
Foehammer not this time -

FOEHAMMER
(cutting in over
transcom)

I’1ll see you at the RV And that
is over and out

The crackle of the TRANSCOM cuts dead
Silence

Then

CORTANA
Chief I don’t know if this is
worth mentioning It’s only half a
chance Maybe not even that

MASTER CHIEF
(cutting in)
Cortana - spit it out

CORTANA
Its just what’s in sub-section
five
(beat)
Vehicle storage

MASTER CHIEF walks over to one of the RECESSED DOORS and
thumps the access panel

The DOOR opens - to reveal one pristine and fuelled WARTHOG
MASTER CHIEF
How long before meltdown

Semen”

CORTANA
Less than five minutes

MASTER CHIEF nods

MASTER CHIEF
Lets buckle-up

cur To -

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMNEXIT FROM VEHICLE STORAGE

MASTER CHIEF at the wheel of the WARTHOG

hard on opposite lock four-wheel drifting out of the
exit to the VEHICLE STORAGE BAY

INT PILLAR OF AUTUMN - THE ESCAPE

WHAT FOLLOWS IS A REAL-TIME WHITE-KNUCKLE DRIVE THROUGH THE
PILLAR OF AUTUMN - pure choreographed action a recreation of
the final level of the game

CORTANA provides a countdown

The ship is exploding and collapsing around them

Great tongues of fire gush from side vents and up through
the floor

Explosions cause huge metal panels to spin through the air as
shrapnel

They drive THROUGH desperate battles between the FLOOD and
the COVENANT

GRUNTS and JACKALS are smeared beneath the wheels

BLOATED INFECTION FORMS explode across the bonnet

PLASMA GRENADES detonate around them throwing them onto two
wheels

An ELITE leaps aboard the WARTHOG clambering over the
passenger side - and with one hand on the wheel MASTER
CHIEF unloads a clip into its face
“Serge

They JUMP over ramps SKID around curving networks of
corridors

SNATCHES OF DIALOGUE THROUGHOUT

CORTANA
Three minutes left Chief Step on
it

MASTER CHIEF
I’m stepping

CORTANA
Incoming

CORTANA
Watch out for the -

CORTANA
Chief - up ahead there’s a gap At
top speed we should be able to make
it

FOEHAMMER
(over transcom)
Be advised RV is smoking hot

They finally BREAK THROUGH to the UPPER LEVEL of the ship to
the landing decks

CORTANA
One minutes left And theres
Foehammer

EXT PILLAR OF AUTUMNDECK

The WARTHOG rips across the landing deck towards FOEHAMMER‘S
DROPSHIP weaving between cargo crates

And as it drives a SEA of the INFECTION VESSELS is bearing
down on them So innumerable that they are liquid in their
movement

CORTANA
Fifty seconds

An EXPLOSION beneath the WARTHOG lifts the vehicle high into
the air

In mid-air MASTER CHIEF jumps clear - separating himself
from the tumbling vehicle
Sane

He hits the ground skidding across the deck
Finding his feet

Sprinting the last twenty metres to the open rear hatch of
the DROPSHIP

CORTANA
Forty seconds

as the INFECTION VESSELS and INFECTED FORMS cascade
behind him

INT FOEHAMMERS PELICAN DROPSHIP

MASTER CHIEF punches the mechanism to close the hatch -
transfixed only momentarily by the sight of the Flood legion
bearing down on him

then the hatch seals just ag the wave is about to hit
them

He turns

es MASTER CHIEF
Foehammer Lets get out of

The words dry up in his throat

MASTER CHIEF
- here

FOEHAMMER is standing directly behind him

But there’s something strange Her expression Her slightly
parted mouth

FOEHAMMER
Chief

Suddenly out of that parted mouth blood is spilling

And PROJECTING from FOEHAMMERS stomach through torn flight
suit and an expanding blossom of blood is a long spike of
FLOOD TENTACLE

FOEHAMMER
-» I’m sorry

Then her body is tossed sideways like a rag-doll

revealing the INFECTED FORM behind

MASTER CHIEF
Silva

MAJOR SILVA - still recognizable despite the trauma to his
body and face

A moment on MASTER CHIEF’S visor
Then INSIDE his VISOR on his eyes

A sudden gense that the endless deaths have taken their toll
That perhaps the death of Foehammer matters most of all

Then reveal
Tn MASTER CHIEF’S HAND - a FRAGMENTATION GRENADE

His fist shoots out and literally plunges into SILVA’S
chest

Then his fist withdraws
Empty

A beat later the grenade detonates inside SILVA and the
mutated man is vaporized

CORTANA
Chief

MASTER CHIEF
Ten seconds
(beat)
Yeah

cut TO -

EXT OUTER SPACEHALO

The ring world Hanging in space

In a moment of peace again as we first saw it

Held for several beats

Then on its interior curve — a sudden bright FLASH of light
Almost seeming insignificant to the scale

But from this flash of light a secondary shock wave follows
Scrape”

And from the detonation point a single section detaches from
the main

and spins slowly across the diameter of the ring
we until it collides with the curve on the far side

Then almost gracefully the entire ring world begins to
break apart

Shattering splintering

And finally as the Forerunner systems and energies are
cgatastrophically disrupted and unleashed

exploding

And from this explosion we find one tiny ship escaping the
cataclysm

The Pelican

INT FOERHAMMERS PELICAN DROPSHIP

MASTER CHIEF is in FOEHAMMER’S pilot seat
CORTANA is manifested beside him
Silence Then

MASTER CHIEF
Did anyone else make it

CORTANA
Scanning
(beat)
Just dust and echoes We’re all
that’s left

She turns to MASTER CHIEF

CORTANA
We did what we had to For Earth
An entire Covenant Armarda
obliterated And the Flood with
it It’s over Chief

A beat
MASTER CHIEF

I don’t see how it’s over What
about getting back to Earth
CORTANA
Earth Well I can point you in
the right direction Four stars
down two across As long as we
dont take any detours we should
get there in around a hundred and
sixty three thousand years

MASTER CHIEF
In this ship

CORTANA
Yes

MASTER CHIEF
But what about in that one

CORTANA looks to where he points

A rip appearing in the fabric of space

and out of it the vast shape of a COVENANT CAPITAL SHIP

EXT OUTER SPACEDROPSHIP

The tiny DROPSHIP banks left towards the CAPITAL SHIP

then engages engines to attack

END

Except

after the credits have rolled we find ourselves back in
space amidst the debris of Halo

Joined then by a faint MUSICAL HUMMING

A moment later the MONITOR appears Across screen left to
right

Then stops center screen to face us

343 GUILTY SPARK
Oh Hello

FADE TO BLACK
