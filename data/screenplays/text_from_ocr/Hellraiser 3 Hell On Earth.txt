EXT DERELICT STREET TWILIGHT
Night is falling in a forgotten part of the city

The street-lights are a joke - three out of four are dead
Only a large moon and some cloud-streaked stars illuminate

dark and derelict street

Once the hub of an industrial area now the buildings are
abandoned the sidewalks choked with litter and debris

are boarded-up windows are glassless walls are graffitied
At various points several BUMS warm their hands at trash-
fires

street Heard OFF is the sound of a smooth and powerful
engine

ANGLE ON STREET
Down this boulevard of decay and despair drives an
incongruously expensive car - a Range Rover A rich kid is

going shopping

The car cruises the ruins until it pulls up outside the only
open store on the block

ANGLE ON STORE

A dim light bulb shines within - the only indicator that the
store is still trading Its windows are grimy its door
defaced Above the door - barely legible through the

dirt of city years - a sign CARDUCCIS ANTIQUES AND CURIOS

ANGLE ON CAR

The side door opens - helped on its way by the kick of an
expensive leather boot - and JP MONROE steps out

JP is 24 rich handsome and spoiled His hair is slick

designer-grease his slim frame is wrapped in a 600 leather
jacket

For a moment he surveys the store and casts contemptuous
glances up and down the ruined street He shows no anxiety

being in this twilight part of town Cocooned in the
confidence of wealth hes never felt threatened in his

Satisfied hes in the right place he walks confidently

INT CARDUCCIS ANTIQUES NIGHT

The store itself looks like an antique - old wood panelling
is

50s

share

shelving Victorian display cases and faded wallpaper It
grimy dusty and dimly-lit - and apparently unattended

It is packed with merchandise - shelves and aisles overflow
onto the floor making the place a maze to walk through

The stock is a strange surreal mix Discarded items from

wax dolls and (a specialty of the store) items of

ANGLE ON JP

He wanders through the merchandise casting appraising

at some items Some he even runs his hands over - grimacing
the dust and grime they leave on his fingers But his
suggests he is looking for something specific

Near the rooms center is an old hoarding from the dead days
vaudeville and travelling shows It is tall and broad and
leaning against something behind it

ANGLE ON HOARDING

- which is colorfully and garishly decorated and full of
hyperbolic come-ons to long-dead punters

YOU WILL BE AMAZED THEY SHOULDNT BE ALIVE FREAKS OF

AN EDUCATIONAL SHOW FOR ALL THE FAMILY PRESENTED UNDER THE

its

door

REVEALED is a six-foot tall black rectangular pillar

in beautifully detailed 3-D carvings all in the same matt-
finish as the pillar itself The pillar is extremely

as if a New York avant-garde sculptor has interpreted a

Pole for jaded modern tastes The carvings are of dead
copulating skeletons filigree-patterned boxes and faces
One of these faces - recognizable to the audience but not to
- is the ossified visage of PINHEAD the demon from the

two HELLRAISER pictures

ANGLE ON JP

- as he leans in to study this face already fascinated by
calm cruelty and promise of dark wisdom
A voice OFF startles him

BUM
You want it

JP whirls round in shock A BUM is standing close to him
ANGLE ON BUM
He has long matted black hair and a similarly greasy beard
His eyes are a piercing excited blue Otherwise he is
indistinguishable from those we saw on the street outside -
ragged tatty clothes features blackened with grime
ANGLE ON JP

- as he glances round the store and past the bum to the

beyond has this character just wandered in from the street

Is it yours

The Bum smiles shaking his head knowingly

BUM
No Not mine Yours

JP nods still a little uncertain

JP
How much do you want for it

BUM
Whatever you think its worth

JP digs a hand into his back pocket and pulls out a wad of
cash Without counting or checking he proffers it

The Bums hand flies out and siezes JPs pressing the money
between their palms making the exchange into a handclasp

In the background OUT OF FOCUS is Pinheads face on the
pillar

BUM (OFF)
Enjoy

The FOCUS switches so that the hands in foreground BLUR and
Pinheads frozen face becomes SHARP as if he is silently
watching this deal take place

INT HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM NIGHT
BLACKNESS Voice OVER

JOEY
Its a mystery to me

SMASH-CUT to full-frame VIDEO IMAGE image of JOANNE
SUMMERSKILL standing and looking directly into camera as

we are watching a TV broadcast In shot behind her is a

hospital Emergency Room - no patients no staff just beds
intensive-care equipment

Joanne - or JOEY as she prefers to be called - is 23 years
old an attractive and clever brunette with a quiet sadness

in

her eyes that she usually manages to keep almost hidden

Dressed in the stylish but sedate garb of a TV newsperson
she

holds a microphone marked with the logo of her station W-
QOY

Her direct address to the unseen TV camera continues

JOEY
Most nights this inner-city Emergency
Room would be a chaos of blood and panic
and grace under pressure But tonight
as you see its like Death took a
holiday Its a mystery to me A
mystery how those assholes at
Assignments knew it This is Joey
Summerskill for W-QQY Emergency Room
No story Really really pissed off

Despite the nature of her last few words Joey has
ironically

kept up the manner and delivery of a newscaster Now she

breaks mood looks away from the camera and with a
dismissive

wave of the hand begins to walk out of shot

JOEY
Ah break it down Doc Its a bust

CUT TO WIDE

- to reveal that we are not watching a broadcast at all but
are in the ER in real time As well as Joey the room

contains
her cameraman (DOC FISHER) and an ER NURSE

Doc - a 45 year old with a weight problem a nicotine
addiction and a cynical attitude - lowers a shoulder-
mounted
Video camera and watches Joey walk to a water-cooler against
a

wall His expression is a mix of exasperation and sympathy
crushes

He

The Nurse is a middle-aged woman of Asian ancestry She has
puzzled expression as she addresses Doc
NURSE
She can talk like this on television

She can say this thing This assholes

Doc replies but keeps his eyes on Joey as he crosses to her

Doc
No sweat sweetheart Its for the
European satellite Joey rein it

in kid They couldntve known
Joey sucks angrily at water from a paper-cup and then
and bins the cup like an act of revenge

JOEY
I know I know But its just so
neat isnt it The first gig that
isnt cute kids or diet gurus and its
taken away from me

boc
Yeah well like you said - its a
mystery But thats all it is
Mystery Not malice What you think

Doc

go by your place

JOEY
Youd lose the money-shots No Ill
catch a bus Or a cab Dont worry
about it Go

Doc
OK Be careful And lighten up Story
of your life could be right round the
corner

JOEY
That is the story of my life

With a rueful smile Joey watches Doc leave

Joey and the Nurse exchange glances - Joeys impassive but
vaguely friendly the Nurses a little disapproving if the
cameras gone what the hell are YOU still doing here

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR NIGHT

Joey makes her solitary way along a medium-length corridor
that has two sets of double swing doors at either end one

giving on to the ER the other toward an exit Joey is
for the latter her mood sad and defeated
ANGLE ON EXIT DOORS

Suddenly - SMASH - the doors burst open from the other

ANGLE ON CORRIDOR

The mood is suddenly fast and urgent as a gurney is wheeled
rapidly through the doors
pushing

is

them

long

buried

RAPID-

Two PARAMEDICS both male both about Joeys age are

the gurney at a run and talking rapidly to each other They
completely ignore Joey and also ignore the TEENAGE GIRL who

running beside the gurney
The girl - TERRI - is 18 or 19 She is a pale-faced blonde

dressed as if for a Desperately-Seeking-Susan party and is
keeping up a stream of chatter as if rehearsing excuses

As Joey flattens herself against the corridor wall to let

pass it is neither the paramedics nor Terri that get her
attention It is the BOY on the gurney

ANGLE ON GURNEYBOY

The teenage boy lies flat on his back semi-conscious his
eyelids fluttering his breathing shallow

Horribly shockingly dangling from his face and body are

heavy chains that drag and rattle along the corridor floor
There are at least sixteen of them and they seem firmly

in his skin
ANGLE ON CORRIDOR
The DIALOGUE as the gurney is rushed to the ER doors is

FIRE and OVERLAPPED the Paramedics responding only to each
other and ignoring the two girls comments and questions

TERRI
It wasnt my fault It wasnt my fault

PARAMEDIC 1
10 milligram IV Valium stat How the
fuck did this happen

TERRI
It was outside I wasnt even with him

PARAMEDIC 2
You ever see anything like this before
TERRI
He must have stolen it

JOEY
Whats going on

PARAMEDIC 1

Yeah sure Five times a fucking day
Just push

Once the gurney has passed her Joey runs along behind it

TERRI
It was off the statue In the club

JOEY
What happened to him

PARAMEDIC 2
Think theyll get him back

TERRI
Its nothing to do with me
PARAMEDIC 1
Worst case of status Ive seen Even
money at best
The foot of the gurney slams into the ER doors and the
Paramedics slide it rapidly through
JOEY
Wait Ima reporter Tell me where he
was
ANGLE ON ER THROUGH DOORS
The Nurse and a middle-aged DOCTOR are seen through the
doors
preparing emergency equipment The Doctor already has
fibrillator pads in his hands
The Paramedics follow the gurney through and turning
rapidly

push the doors closed from the inside

ANGLE ON CORRIDOR
Joey and Terri are alone excluded from the ER activity

Joey
turns to speak but Terri is already halfway to the other
doors
Joey runs after her
JOEY
Hold on Hold on please I need
talk to you
TERRI
(over her shoulder)
Its nothing to do with me I wasnt
even with him
Joey catches up with her a couple of yards short of the
doors
She grabs at her arm to slow her down
Terri turns snatching her arm away in a sudden moment of
fierce
anger She backs toward the doors making gestures of
dismissal and denial with her hands
TERRI
Look lady I told you Its not my
problem I was just there
JOEY
Where

TERRI
Under The Underground Can I like GO
now
JOEY
Under the Underground Whats that
Where is
Suddenly the conversation is interrupted by a shatteringly
loud SCREAM agonized and terrified coming from the ER
Both girls freeze but then their reactions are very
different

Joey turns instantly and runs back toward the ER Terri
doors

in

force

watches her for a beat and then heads through the other

The SCREAM continues a howling horrible sound
Joey reaches the ER doors and throws them open And freezes

terrified shock

INT EMERGENCY ROOM NIGHT
THE DOCTOR
- is on the floor as if flung there by some powerful

The fibrillator pads are still in his hands and his

expression

muttering to herself and making the gesture of the cross

ANGLE ON TABLE

The Boy is on the emergency table Its him thats

His body is arched tight in shock eyes and mouth wide open
Hes wired up to an ECG and the MONITOR shows a heartbeat
should be measured on the Richter scale

The chains - all still connected to his face and his body -—

rigid and tight being pulled straight up into the air as if
tugged taut by invisible hands

The boys skin is stretched and pulled at those points where
the chains are connected to him and it seems horribly

that his flesh will burst if the pressure continues

The scene is held for a terrible frozen moment Then

suddenly

the chains drop the scream stops and the boys body
slumps

There is a massive ELECTRICAL SURGE The ECG flat-lines
before

it and the other monitors go haywire sparking and
spluttering

CUT TO WIDE
The lights in the room flicker and strobe

The fibrillator pads arc angrily The Doctor flings them

away

ELECTRIC ENERGY seems to run along the slumped chains and
they

disappear as if dissolved in some impossible electric
meltdown

Lighting and machinery return to normal (ECG still flat-
lining)

and the medical staff stare thunder-struck at the dead boy

For the first time the other people in the ER become aware
of

Joeys presence in the doorway

DOCTOR
Whos that Get her out of here

The Nurse heads for the doors Joey is already backing

away

ANGLE THROUGH DOORS INTO CORRIDOR

- as Joey backs away an expression of numbed shock on her
face The doors close over blocking her out

CLOSE on flickering neon light in the bus cabin
ANGLE ON JOEY
- glancing at the light from her seat
JOEYS POV - VARIOUS ANGLES
The bus is almost deserted Three other passengers - A
BAG LADY and A WINO - are spread out around the interior
seem lost in worlds of their own but their vacant alienated

stares highlight Joeys isolation and tension Fear has
entered her life

The bus moves through the neon-lit loneliness of downtown
streets

ANGLE ON JOEY

- her face lit by reflected store-signs and street-lights
lost and distant as if she is submerged in some dream-sea
memory and sadness
INT TV STATION EDITING SUITE DAY
A wall of TV monitors each monitor showing Joey sitting on
couch with a painfully thin older woman - BRITTANY VERTUE
Brittanys probably 50 but her face is as tight and smooth
surgery can make it She is dressed in the standard uniform
the health-avatar brightly-colored leotard over black

Joey has a big paperback book - BEYOND HUNGER THE BRITTANY
VERTUE GUIDE TO HOLISTIC DIETING - which she holds to

She smiles and turning to face Brittany crosses her legs

The image freezes And replays Joey crosses her legs
editing

And again And again

BRAD

(over)
See This is what I mean Your
technique is all wrong

CUT TO WIDE
Joey (in real time) is sitting in an easy chair in the
suite looking at the wall of monitors

BRAD a techie in his late-twenties and DOC FISHER are in
swivel chairs immediately in front of the video console

All three are drinking coffee Doc is smoking a cigarette

JOEY
(guardedly)
What do you mean

BRAD
I mean hardly any thigh Im telling

Doc chuckles in a half-friendly half-sleazy way

JOEY
Fuck you

JOEY

Doc
Ah give her a break

Doc leans over and stops the tape

BRAD

He swivels his chair round to face Joey

BRAD
Cmon Joey Im just trying to help

JOEY
Yeah Well you just struck out It
may be a surprise to you Brad but I

BRAD
Right Like last nights doozie

JOEY

BRAD
And I believe what you say But this is
TV No pictures no story

Doc
Yeah too bad I had to go and

BRAD
and cover something on Planet Earth
See you gotta remember Joey this is a
LOCAL station As in local to this
galaxy

Joey slams her coffee mug down and stands up

JOEY
Theres a story out there

BRAD

INT UNDER THE UNDERGROUND NIGHT
CLOSE on a screaming male face twisted as in pain or fury
PULL BACK rapidly to REVEAL the face belongs to the lead
of THANATOS He is on a nightclub stage with the rest of
band all of them dressed in that shit-poor-white-trash-on-
look favored by all such rich young businessmen with
A tatty banner across the back of the stage proclaims UNDER
THE UNDERGROUND PRESENTS THANATOS
The SCREAM ends replaced with the roaring thunder of drums
guitars as Thanatos kick into some thrash-metal
The dance-floor of the club is packed with KIDS dancing to
incredibly fast incredibly loud music
Many of the kids favor the same look as the band but its
exclusive college types are there too along with some -
and female - sporting the glitz-meets-sleaze look of Terri
The club itself is of course dimly-lit and the basic decor
black Where it is distinguished from hundreds of others is
the bizarre sculptures and pieces of artwork that hang from
ceiling and walls all in tones of black silver and gray
VARIOUS ANGLES ON SCULPTURES

A pair of male and female heads Bonsai-like trees grow out

every orifice - eye-sockets nostrils ears and mouths

A human arm with the skin and flesh of its upper half peeled
open and pinned out to reveal inside - instead of bone and
sinew - an entire miniature metropolis beautifully

A black bird cage containing a fetal skeleton

VARIOUS ANGLES ON CLUB

Kids also crowd the bar and the tables on the outskirts of
dance floor It is a hot sweaty faintly aggressive
atmosphere - people jostling for position shouting to be

heard etc etc

The camera finds Joey - incongruous by dress and demeanor —
pushing her way among the crowd

The music is too loud and overpowering to hear Joeys voice
it is clear as she moves through the confines of the club
she is approaching various people and enquiring after Terri
FOUR KIDS AT A TABLE

- shake their heads and shrug
A PUNK

- stares blankly and blinks
TWO BIMBOS

- giggle purse their lips shake their heads
JOEY

- catches sight of a blonde figure moving across the dance
floor and pushes through the crowd to follow She taps the
figures arm but as it turns she realizes it is a man —

Joeys mouth moves and this time she seems to get some
response The Glitter-Rocker mouths a name

Joey cant hear him She hands him a business card and a
He scrawls a name on the back of the card and Joey nods her
thanks as he moves on
CLOSE ANGLE ON CARD
- as Joey reads the name Terri on it She flips the card

reveal her name and number and writes Terri - Please

ANGLE ON BAR

- as Joey pushes to the counter and hands the card to a
who looks at it nods and puts it beneath the counter
ANGLE ON EXIT

- as Joey makes her way out
ANGLE ON DANCE FLOOR
Camera moves into the tightly-packed throng on the dance
making its way slowly toward the previously unseen center
The crowd parts slightly to reveal in the direct center of
floor the tall black pillar from the opening sequence
The pillar is mounted on a plinth and spins as the clientele
dance around it It seems very in keeping with the decor of
the club but even so it is a strong unsettling presence

The pillar has been mounted upside down so that it looks

odder than our first glimpse of it Near the bottom the
inverted face of Pinhead black and frozen can be seen

The camera begins to spin around the pillar in contrary
to the pillars own movement and as it does so draws

closer

and closer making for a disorienting vertiginous image

As this happens the raucous sound of the band Thanatos
begins

to fade into a whirl of ECHO and to be replaced by a
whirring

spinning sound which we only recognize fully as we

CcuT TO

EXT DENSE JUNGLE DAY (JOEYS DREAM)

The screen is filled with dense jungle foliage

The chugging spinning sound is now identifiable as the sound
of

Helicopter blades one element of a SOUND MONTAGE conveying
the

sense and feel of a Jungle War Helicopters in flight
machine

gun fire distant explosions confused shouts and cries

A POV camera pushes its way through the lush humid
greenery

The camera seems to be searching for something glancing
this

way and that shoving leaves and tall grass aside

Voices begin to emerge clearly from the SOUND MASS off-
screen

as if the unseen seeker is getting nearer to his or her
goal

SOLDIER 1
(off)
Call for a Medi-Vac

SOLDIER 2
(off)
Dont die man Dont fucking die

The dialogue prompts a more furious effort on the part of

the

POV camera Pushing frantically through the obscuring
foliage
it finally gains a clearer view and stops looking ahead

In a tiny clearing ten feet from the camera still
partially
obscured by the jungle two camouflage-clad SOLDIERS lean

over

the prone body of a third It is unclear due to distance
but

there is a lot of blood on the Soldiers body and uniform

A new sound joins the SOUND MONTAGE - a persistent
rhythmic

ringing sound The other elements die away until only this
is

left and we recognize it as the sound of a telephone as we

INT BEDROOM JOEYS APARTMENT NIGHT

Joey jerks upright in bed as the ringing continues
Confused

and disoriented her eyes fly around her darkened bedroom as
if

shes trying to understand where she is and what is
happening

Finally she registers the phone and leans toward her

bedside
table to pick it up
ANGLE ON BEDSIDE TABLE
- favoring the luminous display of an alarm clock next to
the
phone Its warm green figures show the time is 235
JOEY

God This better be birth marriage or
death
ANGLE ON JOEY

- as she picks up the handset and puts it to her ear

JOEY

Uh Hi Is this er Joanne

JOEY

Bit of a culture clash here)

JOEY
No No Its fine Come now I was

INT MAIN ROOM JOEYS APT NIGHT

CLOSE on the front door of the apartment as it opens to
Terri leaning against the doorframe

Clad identically to how we last saw her Terri clutches a
stuffed leather bag containing all her worldly possessions

TERRI
Hi Howre you doing

Not waiting for either reply or invitation she moves

CUT TO WIDE

- as Terri walks past the dressing-gowned Joey and heads
straight for Joeys sofa and sprawls on it laying her bag

the floor beside her

TERRI
You got anything to drink

Joey closes the door raised eyebrows registering her slight
disapproval at Terris cavalier attitude Her voice

is polite
JOEY
I put some decaf on Er make

yourself comfortable

TERRI
Right

Joey walks past Terri and through to her kitchen from where
hear the sound of COFFEE BEING POURED

Terri looks around at Joeys room

VARIOUS ANGLES ON ROOM

The large and spacious room suggests that even if Joey is
dissatisfied with her job shes at least being paid enough

make it bearable The room is very ordered very neat but
the

taken

stops short of being prissy
A very large picture window takes up all of one wall At
moment of course the drapes are closed Another wall is

up by a huge shelf unit packed with books videos and CDs
Joeys obsession with getting the whole story seems to be
true of her personal life as well as her professional

ANGLE ON TERRI
- having finished her quick examination she calls out

TERRI
So what was your bad dream

Joey re-enters carrying two mugs of coffee

JOEY
What

TERRI
Your dream You said you were having a
bad dream

JOEY
Oh yeah

She hands one coffee to Terri and sits opposite her

JOEY

TERRI
What is it

JOEY
Why are you so interested

TERRI
Sorry
JOEY

Terri pauses

Oh right Did he used to

Joey waits

cigarette

letting herself catch up with Terris good-

but marginally strung-out personality She looks around the
room as if trying to remember where there are cigarettes

JOEY
Uh yeah Yeah somewhere Wait a
minute

Joey crosses to the big shelf-unit and pulls out a concealed
pack of cigarettes a Zippo lighter and an ashtray from

a shelf of videos We notice that the videos are THE WORLD

WAR volumes 1 thru 26 She brings the smokes to Terri

TERRI
Great Thanks You gonna have one

JOEY
Im trying to quit

TERRI
Oh go on Have one Fuck it You
think youre going to live forever

She smiles and proffers the pack to Joey who shrugs smiles
and takes one Terri picks up the Zippo and sparks it A

FLAME leaps out of the lighter producing an instant of

from Terri

Joey pulls the lighter back from Terri and

the lid extinguishing the flame Terri draws a book of

from her pocket shakily attempts to light her cigarette

JOEY
Sorry It was my fathers Its
temperamental

TERRI

Its okay Its just someone burned me
once
Joey takes the book of matches from Terris hands and lights
both cigarettes Terri takes a long fearful look at the
burning flame and then takes a deep calming drag of her
cigarette

TERRI
Wanna know how I look at it Way I see
it is you give up right Three

days later you get hit by a fucking
truck and you know - you just KNOW -
that your last thought as you go under
those wheelsd be Jesus H Christ I
coulda smoked another three packs

She lays the book of matches down Joeys eyes go to them
ANGLE ON MATCHES

Black letters on the dark-grey cover UNDER THE UNDERGROUND
ANGLE ON JOEY AND TERRI

Terris eyes flick to the match-book and her mood changes
becoming subdued and a little sullen

TERRI
Oh You wanna talk about that stuff

JOEY
Yes I do Terri something awful
happened to that boy I have to find
out what it was

TERRI
But I dont know anything Really I
just came out of the club and the kid
was already in the street He

JOEY
Did you know him

TERRI
No Id seen him in there a few times
before He was just a punk Id never
like danced with him or anything
Anyway he was a thief He mustve
taken it from the statue

JOEY
Taken what

at it before he passed out and

JOEY
Wait Wait The chains Where did the

chains come from

TERRI
Thats what Im trying to tell you

Terri rummages in her bag getting hold of something

TERRI
He said they came out of this

She holds her hand out and the camera TRACKS in to meet it
ANGLE ON TERRIS HANDBOX
Resting on her palm is a black cube about 4 inches square

has the same matt-black carbonized look as the pillar and is
recognizable as one of the carvings we saw on it

There is fine filigree pattern-work over each of its
and to audiences familiar with the HELLRAISER movies the

is recognizable despite its black coating it is the Lament
Configuration the puzzle box that opens the doors to Hell

There is a stubby shard of material protruding from one side

CUT TO WIDE

The club is empty The dim lighting of working hours has
replaced with the sickly gleam of one or two fluorescent
and the club has that eerie not-quite-right look that all

places have when subjected to a harsher light

Two WORKERS are in the final stages of clearing the nights
debris - emptying trash into big black plastic bags wiping
down tables and bars etc

Work completed they head to the main exit

One of them hits the light switches so that the fluorescent
clarity is again replaced by the more appropriate dim

His co-worker grins and they let themselves out

A beat Another door opens into the club and JP Monroe —

Suddenly jarringly there is a quiet but distinct SQUEAK
seems to come from within the hole
JP starts back a little a small expression of anxiety on
normally supercilious face He glances to right and left
a grip and leans forward again
ANGLE ON PILLARHOLE

- as again the noise comes Is it a squeak - or is it

creaking shifting of hidden machinery hidden chains

JPs hand moves tentatively into shot approaching the hole
Slowly slowly it reaches wrist-deep into the blackness

Some small drops of blood stand out bright red on the

of the pillar The sizzling noise is coming from them
Suddenly the drops draw together magically into one large
of blood - already larger than possibility would allow

it gets wierder the blood suddenly dissipates into six or
seven little rivulets that begin to run down the pillar

mess

The streams of blood dont simply fall straight They seem
follow some pre-gouged pattern running down the pillar

the blackened organic contours of the carvings

They all culminate at the point of Pinheads chin - and then
separate again running over his frozen black face along the
carved scar lines that make a matrix across his features

When every canal line on the demons face is filled neatly

blood a BLUE LIGHT seems to glow from within the pillar
through Pinheads face giving it temporarily the blue tone

had enjoyed in (un)life

CLOSE on his awe-struck face - bathed in reflected blue

ANGLE ON PINHEAD

vanishing with it leaving the same frozen implacable
as before but charged now with a waiting power

CUT TO WIDE

Joey in her dressing-gown stands in the doorway with a
shocked expression on her face

Terri in an oversized mans shirt stands by the stove
a fish-slice and smiling nervously

TERRI
I figured Id make breakfast

JOEY
Right Thats er thats nice
of you Terri Can I ask Is it always
this exploratory

TERRI

Ha I dont know yet First time
Kitchen virgin thats me

Joey nods slowly crossing to a cabinet and taking out some
instant coffee

JOEY
Ill boil some water

TERRI
Ill do it

JOEY
No No thats OK I like to I love
boiling water Its a specialty of
mine Why dont you go watch cartoons

Joey watches Terri walk out of the kitchen sighs in relief
and grabs the kettle
INT MAIN ROOM JOEYS APT

Joey sits drinking her coffee as Terri walks round the
room
with hers

TERRI
This is great And its yours You

JOEY
The bank owns it But Im working on
it

TERRI
Jeez Ive never owned anything I
havent even had a room of my own since
I was fifteen years old

JOEY
How have you

TERRI
Guys Sometimes friends Mostly guys

Terri walks past Joeys TV set (sound down cartoons
playing)

ANGLE ON TV

The Box is on top of the TV In the warm light of morning
it
seems innocuous and harmless like just another ornament

DIFFERENT ANGLE

- as Terri walks on pausing by the shelves of books

TERRI
Wow Lotta books You read all these

JOEY
No I buy them to impress people Of
course Ive read them

TERRI
Cool I read a book once It was like

BOY

his

all these people discovering who they
used to be You know like
reincarnation It was really good You
ever read that

JOEY
I dont think so But its a
fascinating subject Did you

But Terri has already moved on She is by the big picture
window The drapes are now open

TERRI
Great view Great view Look at this

Joey stands and walks to join Terri
JOEY
Actually Im pretty familiar with the
view

GIRLS POV - THROUGH WINDOW

Joeys apartment is on a high floor and her window overlooks
many lower buildings giving a view of the city beyond

JOEY
(off)
but it is good You know over to
the left you can

TERRI
(looking to right and pointing)
Whos that
On the flat roof of a nearby building a RETARDED TEENAGE

sits motionless in an old rusty deck chair next to a small
Jerry-built pigeon coop Its door is open and it is empty

The boy is some distance from the girls but his solitude

stillness and the empty coop beside him lend the scene an
atmosphere of sadness and loss

As Joey tells his story we INTERCUT between the POV of the

roof and the girls at the window

ANGLE ON JOEY

- as she realizes she has a wounded pigeon of her own

JOEY
I dont know his name I saw the
whole story A wounded bird was on his
roof I could hear its cries from here
He went straight to it I couldntve
Id be frozen between pity and fear
But he wasnt Its pain spoke directly
to him He picked it up Nursed it
Fed it And it got better Everyday
hed watch the pigeon Everyday the
pigeon would watch him I saw him learn
Learn that there was one more thing he
had to do to make the rescue complete
And one day just as afternoon became
evening he leaned over opened the
cage and walked away Didnt look
back But he heard the sound of its
wings

TERRI
And he still sits there

JOEY
Every day

TERRI
Maybe he thinks itll come back

JOEY
No He knows it wont It was his
final act of love and part of him knows
that and part of him doesnt yet

TERRI
Bullshit He shouldve kept it Itd
live longer Its dangerous out there
People get hurt

JOEY
What I wasnt talking about I
Do you want to stay You want to stay
here for a while
Terri shrugs gives a nervous smile

Joey crosses to the TV picks up the Box and weighs it in

her
hand
JOEY
OK OK Its a done deal But look -
you have to help me Ive got to solve
this thing Ive got to know whats
going on
Terri follows across the room and sits on the sofa
TERRI
But I dont know whats going on
JOEY
Maybe not But you know more than I do
You know something about this box
Something about a statue
TERRI
Yeah I found it I knew held like it

JOEY

TERRI

JOEY
Its Saturday morning Lets go

shopping

EXT DERELICT STREET DAY
Joeys Mazda 323 drives down the street

The daylight street is still creepy but in a different way
No

bums no trash-can fires nothing It has the feel of a
ghost

town as if nothing has breathed here for years

ANGLE IN CAR
Joey at the wheel has a disbelieving look on her face

Terri smoking flicks ash through her wound-down window

JOEY
Jesus Are you sure this is the street

TERRI
Yeah Happening isnt it

JOEY
What on earth were you doing down here

An evasive silence

JOEY
Terri

TERRI
Buying some drugs alright

JOEY
Oh Terri

TERRI
For somebody else alright Not for me
I dont do that shit anymore

JOEY
Then you shouldnt even be around it

You know its

Joey brings the car to a halt outside the antique store
Terri scrambles out of the passenger door

TERRI
Yeah See I told you it was here

CLOSE ANGLE ON JOEY

- as she looks at Terri from behind her face worried for

her

new and screwed-up friend

INT CARDUCCI’S ANTIQUES DAY

Joey and Terri enter the store

The store is different its selection of merchandise
reduced

The 50s and 60s junk hardware is still there along with
some

of the more mundane Victoriana but it seems more normal -
none of the odd items of punishment memorabilia are there

Also because it is daylight the store seems merely old
interesting and musty not creepy or odd

There seems to be no-one in attendance
ANGLE ON GIRLS
- as they walk through the store
MAMA

(off)
Can I help
The voice startles the girls and they jump around to face

the

counter as MAMA CARDUCCI moves into view from beneath it

Mama an ancient and slightly eccentric Italian-American
woman

eyes the girls with the suspicion of somebody who hasnt had
a

customer in decades Not aggressive just surprised

JOEY
Yes Thank you We were wondering

Terri show her the box

Terri removes the box from her purse and holds it up

MAMA
No Sorry Not interested Not for my
customers Have you tried

JOEY

No No you dont understand Were

MAMA
Everything sold as is No guarantees
No returns

JOEY
No We want

MAMA
I took back everything bought on a whim

TERRI

Lady will you shut the fuck up and give
her a break

A sudden silence Both Mama and Joey stare at Terri in
surprise

Mama looks back at Joey

MAMA
Quite a mouth So whats the problem
You tell me You I like

Joey smiles Terri raises her eyes to heaven Mama waits
JOEY
Thank you This came off a statue

A pillar We wondered if you knew
anything about the piece About where
it came from

Mama squints at the box as if trying to recognize it

MAMA
Oh yeah Yeah That thing Ugly
Real ugly I sold that

Mamas eyes scan the store

MAMA
Never mind Im glad its gone Made
the store feel strange Whod make such
a thing

JOEY
Fine Fine But can you tell us

MAMA

A shaft of sunlight throws a square of light on the wooden
floor a few yards in front of the shelves
Joey takes up a big bulging manilla folder from the shelves

begins to look through it

JOEY
Terri check out the other folder

Terri still holding her purse and the box looks around for
somewhere to put them All the shelves are full She lays

them on the floor in the square of sunlight and joins Joey

the shelves grabbing up the second folder

TERRI
What am I looking for

JOEY
God knows Anything Contacts Clues

Terri opens up the folder and begins to pace the floor as
flicks through the contents
TERRI
Jesus Youre gonna pay her for this

Joeys hand reaches a large envelope Scrawled in hand

it is the phrase DR CHANNARD - PERSONAL PAPERS Joey draws
the contents out and begins to sift through them

The first item is a dusty black-and-white photograph of an
officer in English Army uniform circa 1920 Joey blows the
dust from the photo

The next photo is that of a beautiful young woman Joey

COTTON KIRSTY CASE NO 5719

ON BOX

The sounds of the girls flicking through papers is heard OFF
and then FADES as something strange begins to happen

Suddenly the dust around the box begins to move as if blown
an invisible wind It is drawn up so that it forms an
impossible spiral in the air Spinning like a miniature
hurricane it hovers over the box The sunlight seems to

brighter Is it just reflections on the metalwork designs

is the box itself glowing and shining

It is a diagram like a designers drawing or plan And it

CLOSE ANGLE ON JOEYS FACE
- as she realizes what she is looking at
JOEY
(softly)
Alright

Joey turns folder in hand to look at the box on the floor
compare it to the diagram
Joey gasps

The miniature tornado of spiralling dust suddenly disappears
inside the apparently sealed box as if sucked down into it

As if on cue the shaft of sunlight disappears behind a
as the last particle of dust disappears into the box
Joey mouth open in shock lets the folder drop from her

The sound of its splayed contents hitting the floor alerts
Terri who walks back round from the other shelf unit

Terri looks at the dropped contents and then up at Joey

Joey is in mid-conversation on the phone

JOEY
Yeah yeah yeah No its
important that I speak to What No

Joey slams the phone down

She stares at the papers at the scratch pad takes a deep
breath and punches out a number on the phone

This time Joeys voice is different

Another night in Under The Underground

Kids dance

Customers jostle at the bar

Couples neck in shadowed corners

Loud Metal music blasts out from speakers next to the

sculptures on the walls and ceiling

The center of the dance-floor is packed
The pillar is missing
ANGLE ON BAR

Sitting alone at a bar stool - though surrounded by tightly-
packed customers - is SANDY a very pretty teenage girl

is the same basic type as Terri blonde frail young Too
young in fact to be legally in a club like this

Sandy stares at her empty glass - and stares at it wistfully
enough to suggest she doesnt have the money to get it
refilled She is trying to keep up a cool impassive face

her eyes betray her basically vulnerable character

REVERSE ANGLE

Sitting at the opposite end of the bar his eye-line
he is looking at Sandy is JP Monroe
The bar-stool beside JP is occupied by a TEENAGE BOY who has

his back to the bar and is talking to a GROUP of his

JP has a speculative predatory look on his face Without
shifting his gaze he raises his hand and within seconds the

CLOSE on Sandy as a full glass is placed in front of her
alongside the glass is a beautiful long-stemmed red rose
Sandy looks surprised at the drink and then smiles in

at the rose She raises her eyes and looks across the bar
JP returns the smile

He turns to the Boy beside him and murmurs something

The boy glances round as if ready to argue with whoever is
speaking to him On recognizing JP however he vacates the
seat without an argument and stands to join his friends

JP looks back across the bar at Sandy and gestures at the
stool beside him an attractive welcoming smile on his face
Sandy gets up and carrying the drink and the rose makes
way across to sit beside JP

ANGLE ON JP AND SANDY

The deafening music playing in the club means that they have
lean in close to hear each other speak

JP
Welcome

SANDY
Youre JP Monroe right

JP
Uh-huh

SANDY
And this is your club Great club I
really love it here Great club

JP

SANDY

SANDY

and keep it behind the bar And I award
it to a woman of exceptional beauty

SANDY
Oh come on Therere lots of girls here
who look better than

JP
Dont do that Dont put yourself down
If you have a quality be proud of it

While talking and without taking his eyes off Sandy JP
gestures at the barman and their glasses

JP
Let it define you Whatever it is
Most of the roses die behind the bar
This is the first Ive given out for
nearly a month

INT JPS PRIVATE ROOM NIGHT
The music OFF from the club is dull and muffled

JPls private room is the size - and shares the general
appearance of - an expensive studio apartment

His room looks like an annex to his club - black walls

fittings artworks of elegant cruelty - show that JPs taste
for the bizarre is not just professional

Camera explores the room as the sound of BREATHING grows

ANGLE ON PILLAR
- now the right way up it stands in a corner of the room

usual it looks jarring and impressive but it doesnt really
seem out of place in JPs room

The Breathing OFF becomes mixed with MOANS and SMALL CRIES

JP and Sandy both naked are on the bed making love Well
maybe Sandys making love JPs having sex

It is a selfish phallocentric scene concentrating on JPs
concern only for his own gratification It may be an erotic
sight but its not a pretty one

JP is on top He has hold of both Sandys wrists in one of
hands and his body is working away rhythmically He is
upright looking down at her No kissing

CLOSE on JPs face - his eyes open staring down at Sandy
CLOSE on Sandys face - her eyes closed half in pleasure
in shame

SMASH-CUT TO PILLAR

CLOSE on Pinheads face Suddenly horribly the monsters
eyes fly open and his frozen face stares down at the lovers

BLUE LIGHT seems to pulse from within the pillar lending

to Pinheads face

Pinhead continues to watch the love-making until it comes to
climax

As JP GROANS out his orgasm and collapses forward onto

body Pinheads eyes close The BLUE LIGHT disappears and

pillar is just the pillar again

Joey enters the darkened room - and then stops a few feet
the door

Terri - lit only by the moonlight through the blinds - is
on one side of Joeys bed fast asleep Apart from her
which she has kicked off she is fully dressed

Joey approaches the bed and watches her sleeping friend her
face sympathetic affectionate and troubled

Joey reaches over takes one of the pillows from the other

of the bed and lays it at the bottom end

She slips off her shoes shrugs off her jacket and -
delicately carefully - climbs on to the other side of the

JP on his bed in his shorts enjoying a post-coital
blows smoke-rings at the ceiling and all but ignores Sandy

Sandy has put some of her clothes back on and is wandering
around the room admiring it and chattering

SANDY
So cool

She approaches the pillar leans in close closer

nothing happens
SANDY
Radical

She walks on to look at a painting on one of the walls
ANGLE ON PAINTING

Its a painstakingly rendered but crudely imagined piece
The
kind of crap youd buy in a Melrose gallery

Perhaps its called Biker Crucifixion Night-time

somewhere
rural A Hells Angel arms outstretched and stripped to the

waist is tied to a tree by cruelly-tight barbed wire
wrapped

around his body At the foot of the tree his biker friends

WIDER ANGLE ON SANDY AND PAINTING

SANDY
Wow Youve got great taste This
well this really says it you know
Its really dark
ANGLE ON JP

Still staring at the ceiling JP pulls a pained face - like
hes heard this embarrassing shit a hundred times

SANDY
Dont you think

JP
Mmn-hmnn

Sandy turns to look at JP troubled by his unresponsiveness

SANDY
Do you mind me talking about your stuff

JP
Unh-unh

A beat Sandy stares at JP JP stares at the ceiling
the

distract

SANDY
If it bothers you just say so

JP sighs
JP
It doesnt bother me Im just not
interested
SANDY

Oh Like Im not an interesting person
JP blows a smoke ring at the ceiling

Sandy walks back across the room to stand at the foot of the
bed ( And yes fright fans this does put her in front of

pillar - though hopefully the blossoming argument will
audience attention)

SANDY
But you gave me a rose

JP
And tomorrow Ill give one to somebody
else Get dressed Get out

SANDY
You shit Who do you think you are

Sandy is waving her arms to illustrate her point and
through her last line has turned to indicate the pillar
Suddenly - BAM BIG SCARE MOMENT - two blackened arms fly

from the center of the pillar and grab Sandys gesturing

The BLUE LIGHT burns from within illuminating Pinheads
as his eyes open filled with demonic glee and hunger
An impossible WIND begins to whistle through the room as if
echoed glimpse of a storm in Hell
Sandy screams in mortal terror
JP jumps from the bed cigarette falling to the floor He
backs away to the opposite wall face shocked scared
JP

Pinhead smiles sardonically

PINHEAD
Not quite

Pinheads arms pull Sandy tight against the pillar and his
face stifling her scream

JP flattened against the far wall watches in horror as
held tight against the pillar suffers a horrible death
Sandys life-force is sucked from her Drawn into the

It is a matter of seconds only but in those few seconds -

The wind keeps blowing through the room
Finally a dry lifeless husk she is dropped to the floor

The Blue Light fades from within the pillar The wind
disappears

The pillar is again black and stationary But its contours
different more rounded It looks more organic as if

its raw material into new alignments new configurations
pillar seems to be in a process of becoming And the
suggestion is that what it is becoming is Pinhead
Pinheads head arms and torso now protrude from the

They are not completely free and - now that the eating of
Sandy is concluded - seem incapable of independent movement

there is plainly a lot more of him than there was before
Even though the blue light has faded Pinheads face is
noticeably different It is blue-tinged and more fleshy in
appearance Capable of movement And speech

ANGLE ON JP

JP

Appetite sated Desire indulged You
saw the working of the world in

That had nothing to do with the world
Not this one anyway

On the contrary It has everything to

How uncomfortable that word must feel on

black bag He glances round the all-but-deserted street and
enters the club

INT JPS PRIVATE ROOM DAY

CLOSE on Pinheads face in repose back to its statue-like
state

The sound of the door OFF opens the monsters eyes

JP enters closing the door behind him

He doesnt look at the pillar He stays by the door and
his eyes on the long black bag he has brought in with him

He unzips it His manner is that of a man who has made a
decision and is not about to listen to contrary argument

PINHEAD
(off)
Another offering
JP doesnt respond He draws a double-barrelled shotgun
the bag cocks it and loads it

JP turns to face the pillar drawing a bead on Pinhead

Pinheads expression is wearily amused

PINHEAD
Im touched That is the gun you used
to kill your parents

JP visibly staggers as Pinhead lets slip this knowledge
Pinhead smiles

PINHEAD
I understand Their fortune was so
tempting their affection so
conditional What else could you do

JP
Fuck you

He pulls the double trigger
A massive BLAST resounds around the room but thats about
the 30 ott six is absorbed magically into the pillar

PINHEAD
Thank you Now shall we talk sensibly

JP lets the useless gun fall from his hand

PINHEAD
Dont flee from yourself If you have a
quality let it define you Cultivate
it It is you By helping me you will
help yourse

JP
What What are you talking about Why
should I help you

PINHEAD
Because you want to Youve always
wanted to Look at your pictures Look

at your sculptures Look at those
tawdry representations and then

Imagine Imagine a world of the body as
canvas The body as clay Your will
and mine as the brush and the knife

Oh I have such sights to show you

Its working JPs eyes are glittering with excited

JP
What are you

PINHEAD
A dark star rising I was bound to
anothers system by a soul I once
possessed A friend relieved me of that
inconvenience Now Im free Born
again of Blood and Desire
JP
Hey thats what makes the world go
round

Pinhead raises an amused eyebrow at JPs little joke

PINHEAD
You see were not so dissimilar

JP
But how in Gods name

PINHEAD
God My God was diamond and black
light And I was his Dark Pope All
that is changed A terrible beauty is
born With a place at my right hand for
aman of your tastes

JP cruises the room contemplating this

JP
How do we start

It has already begun
INT TV STATION EDITING SUITE NIGHT
ANGLE ON MONITORS

Many screens fill the frame all of them crackling with

snow

CUT TO WIDE

Joey is alone at the control desk She has a video tape in
her

hand and feeds it into the master machine

She looks up at the still-ghosting monitors and then presses
a

few buttons on the console

The snow is replaced by blackness on every monitor with a
time

code ticking away at the bottom of each screen

JOEY
(softly)
Alright Lets see what we got here

The blackness on the monitors gives way to multiple images
KIRSTY the girl in the picture in the antique store

The video image is primitive shot with a non-professional
camcorder and is a simple medium long-shot of Kirsty

in a simple white smock sitting in a hospital room
Kirsty addresses the camera directly though occasionally
up to the side as if speaking to an unseen doctor
INTERCUT through Kirstys monologue between A single

image the wall of monitors and the watching and listening

listening Looks back to camera) I saw
it open I opened it I saw what came
out I dont know what else to call

Or come through the box from somewhere

chastised for kidding around Nods

When the image returns Kirsty is smoking a cigarette to

calm her

Solving the puzzle means opening the
box Opening the box means opening
doors And there are some doors you
dont want to open And it may be
metaphorical to you Doctor but you
havent had some blue-faced bastard come
at you with hooks and chains It isnt
delusion it isnt psychosis Its

Long drag on the cigarette) Maybe not
this reality but there are others

There is a conviction in the telling which is working on

becomes puzzled and she crosses the room to flick ona

She wanders back to the TV looking at the box

It looks different Its edges are more sharply defined
shard where it was broken from the pillar is smaller
The detailed metal-work has some color back and is shining

Sometimes I think shes wierder than me

Terris voice trails off as she continues to look at the

She rubs her thumbs over the designs TRACKING IN

and just as Kirsty finishes her last line (The cenobites

No jungle no trees or grass The ground is baked mud
disfigured with deep trenches re-inforced by wooden slats

despite what the audience knows about it - it still seems
inanimate a black frozen carving disturbing but harmless

Also in there stuffed away at the top of the closet is an
radio - a big old wood-and-wire-grille valve driven beauty
which the lilting music is coming

At some stage in its life part of its casing was smashed
and the pulsing orange light is its flickering vacuum tubes

Its an old mains-powered model and its mains cord dangles

anything except the paranormal

She stares at the radio with the same kind of trapped
fascination with which we have seen characters in the

Her fingers are drawn to the tuning dial as if to a puzzle

She plays with the dial moving through various stations

She stands up slowly and crosses to the drapes The camera
rises and TRACKS in as she walks framing those drapes like
curtains in a theater

With one strong gesture Joey sweeps the drapes open And
gasps

Instead of neighboring roof-tops and a view of the city
is looking directly into the interior of a Quonset hut
It is the image from her TV set though full-size full-
and apparently real

At the far end Elliott sits cross-legged on the floor In
front of him on the floor is the puzzle box

Elsewhere in the hut A camp-bed on which lie a gun-belt and

Officers peaked cap And an old-fashioned radio - the same
radio that is still in Joeys room

CLOSER on the elements in the hut as we (and Joey) realize
that everything in there is frozen in time There is no
movement no sound
Wonderingly (but carefully) Joey stretches her arm out
her When her arm reaches the threshold of the Quonset hut
disappears into the space once occupied by window glass
She pulls her arm back sharply with an intake of breath
she even takes a half-step backward

At the far end of the Quonset Hut behind Elliott a door

Joey looks from the door back to the frozen Elliott

JOEY
Thanks I think

Joey crosses to the door and opens it She walks through

EXT FLANDERS FIELD DAY

Joey walks out onto the World War One battlefield of her
recent dream She stands there - an incongruous vulnerable
figure in her nightdress and robe - amidst the corpses the

trenches and the distant plumes of smoke

JOEY
Whats going on Is this a dream

She glances back at the door of the hut she has just left
JOEYS POV - THROUGH HUT DOOR
Within the hut the frozen Elliott still sits
ANGLE ON JOEY

- as she turns from looking into the hut and gasps her
wide in shock

Standing on a hillock framed against the grey battlefield
skies is Elliott

Joey walks toward him
Elliott stands calmly and smiles at Joey

ELLIOTT
Joey How kind of you to come

A beat Joey (and the audience) take in Elliotts

presence as she and he stand amidst the corpse-strewn

JOEY
Wait wait You you have to help
me I dont understand Am I dreaming
this

ELLIOTT

You have to help me You will
understand And no youre not

dreaming Do you know where we are
JOEY
Its I dont know First World War
right
ELLIOTT
Correct The fields of France And
many dead flowers Oh Forgive me
My name was Spenser Elliott Spenser
Captain

He extends his hand

Joey - slowly and nervously - puts her hand out to shake
his

JOEY
Joey Summerskill

Elliott smiles understandingly as he releases her hand

ELLIOTT
Well done Brave girl Youve probably
never shaken hands with a ghost before
am I right

JOEY
Captain Spenser Elliott I What
the Hell is going on

ELLIOTT
Hell is precisely what is going on
Joey And we have to stop it I
because of a special obligation you
because youre the only person who can
help And because you know what is
right and just and true Will you
walk with me a while

He gestures with his hand and they begin to walk

ELLIOTT
There were days in this war days right
on top of each other when the newly
dead were numbered in the tens of
thousands They called it the war to
end all wars Though it didnt You
know that There were more wars More
dead Your fathers war Your dream
search for your father led you here To
me Joey we need to talk

Elliott does nothing dramatic - he doesnt clap his hands or

snap his fingers - but somehow magically he and Joey
without

moving or changing position are back in the Quonset hut

INT QUONSET HUT

The frozen Elliott is still sitting on the floor before the
box The mobile Elliott gestures at his frozen self as he
speaks to the bemused Joey

ELLIOTT
The war pulled poetry out of some of us
Others it affected differently This is
me a few years later Were in India
by the way and its 1921 I was like
many survivors Lost souls with nothing
left to believe in but gratification
Wed seen God fail you see So many
dead For us God too fell at
Flanders We adjusted to the loss And
if we mourned we mourned in silence
Thousands drank themselves to death
Others went further I went further I
thought I was a lost soul But until
this frozen moment I didnt even know
what the phrase meant

JOEY
And what is this frozen moment

Joey

ELLIOTT
The cusp of my life What I was what I

am what I will be past present
future all bound here at this timeless
moment of decision I was an explorer

of forbidden vices and pleasures
Opening the Box was my final act of
exploration of discovery

JOEY
And what did you discover

ELLIOTT
Something bad

JOEY
And why are you back Why are we here

Again no signal from Elliott but the background changes
magically once more

EXT FLANDERS FIELD DAY
Elliott is once again framed dramatically on the hillock
standing close

ELLIOTT
Because something worse is coming

(a beat)

I opened the Box Joey I found the
monster within it And it found the
monster within me For decades I served
Hell with no memory of my former life
until a friend released me You saw
her

JOEY
Kirsty Cotton Yes But if your
soul was freed why are you back

ELLIOTT
Because - monster as I was - I was bound
by Laws The protocol of Hell The Box

Lovingly

had to be opened to let me out The
truly innocent were safe Thats no
longer true The shell of the beast has
been fleshed What I was is out there
Joey In your world Unbound
Unstoppable

JOEY
What will he do What does he want

ELLIOTT
Hell do what he does best But hell
do it unfettered He wants to walk the
Earth forever indulging his taste for
all the myriad subtleties of human
suffering

JOEY
What can we do

ELLIOTT
I like you Joey You ask all the right
questions There is something we can do

but it will require great courage

JOEY
I dont know

Elliott reaches out and strokes her cheek Gently

We see in Joeys eyes that there is a response there
response beyond the comradely

ELLIOTT
Joey you walked through your window
from one reality to another Youre
stronger than you think

JOEY
Then tell me what to do

ELLIOTT
This is his first night on Earth He
wants to close the door behind him
Like all Lieutenants he covets command
Theres a gateway to Hell through which
he can be taken back He has to destroy
it

INT UNDER THE UNDERGROUND NIGHT
Lights flash Music pounds Kids dance Its a wild night
Under The Underground and its about to get wilder

The source music (thrash metal) builds and builds as if
heading for a climax And then the climax comes

ANGLE ON DOOR TO JPS ROOM

The door BLASTS open explosively from within The pieces of
the shattered door FLY across the dance-floor accompanied

chunks of plaster and brick from the door-surround

VARIOUS ANGLES (QUICK CUTS)

Flying wood and masonry hit people

One chunk SMASHES into the DJ console bringing the music to
scratching screeching end

Various SCREAMS are heard OFF through the ensuing silence
In the confusion kids scramble for the main doorway Is it

bomb Is it a street-gang attack
The Main Doorway SLAMS supernaturally shut bolts flying

into
place untouched by human (or inhuman) hand
Confused and frightened faces turn back to look at the
source
of the explosion
ANGLE ON DOORWAY TO JPS ROOM
Lit from behind by blinding beams of BLUE LIGHT Pinhead
emerges through the doorway Slow Elegant Terrifying
Pinhead surveys the scene before him and the terrified and
awe-
struck crowd look back at him
For the most part the crowd are stunned into silence but
there
are a few murmurs from them
CROWD
(ad-lib)
Oh My God
Jesus Christ
What the FUCK

Pinhead scans the club
He looks at the terrified humans The cruelly beautiful
artworks The humans The artworks The humans The

A small smile forms on his face Hes just had an
entertaining
idea

INT MAIN ROOM JOEYS APT NIGHT

The view through the big picture window is entirely normal
again the cityscape by night
Suddenly Joey seems to appear behind the glass -

translucent

like a reflection - and comes through the window into her
apartment solidifying as she steps in

Her hands are at her head and she staggers forward a few

steps

Its as if the enormity of her trip thru realities has just
hit

her She falls forward onto the floor of her room
unconscious

FADE OUT

FADE IN

- as the ringing of a phone grows in volume

Joey raises her head bleary-eyed and glances round the
room

trying to locate the source of the noise that has woken her

She crawls the few feet to the phone and snatches at it
The

trying

hand-set falls and she has to gather it up from the floor
Maneuvering herself into a sitting position she speaks

JOEY

A fist slams into Eddies face

The Elder Cop at the change in his partners tone looks

Standing in the center of the alley at its far end light
coming from behind him so that he is unclear is Pinhead

(Calm Expecting obedience)
You fuckoff

He turns back to Eddie

ELDER COP
Get your head outta your stinkin ass
and look at me boy

YOUNGER COP
(still looking down alley)
Hey

Pinhead is moving up the alley towards the action
Elder Cop shoves Eddie away

ELDER COP
(to Eddie)
Get lost

Eddie doesnt waste time with questions Hes gone
The Cops straighten up and start walking to meet Pinhead

Pinhead advances- still in the shadows still just a black
shape moving forward

ELDER COP
I have the distinct impression I told
you to fuckoff Unless I miss my guess
youve just disobeyed an officer of the
law

Pinhead emerges into the (dim) light in the alley

PINHEAD
I am the Law

Cops halt in shock at this awesome presence both of them
instinctively drawing their guns And both instinctively
beginning to back up

ELDER COP
Youre one butt-ugly son of a bitch and
youre about to dead meat

PINHEAD
I am the son of eternal night and you
are about to discover pain has no
ending
Well thats enough of a direct threat for any officer of

the

law Both cops fire their guns Once Twice Three
times

Pinhead keeps walking He spits out the bullets that his
body

has absorbed

YOUNGER COP
Oh shh

They empty their guns - useless - and then they turn and run

down the alley And then stop short There is a sudden
wall

of impenetrable blackness in front of them as if the world

simply comes to a stop four yards from their feet

The cops turn terrified to look back Instinctively they

spread apart - each walking near to opposite walls

The younger cop is standing beneath a fire escape He
glances

up as if he might be able to jump up to safety No Too
high

Pinheads head flicks upward as if in a gesture of command

Suddenly the Fire escape ladder zooms downward with
impossible
speed and force

The Younger Cop doesnt even have time to scream The
ladder
smashes right through his body impaling him

His corpse stands there twitching and shuddering wrapped
around the ladder

Elder Cop stares in terror at his partners fate

ELDER COP
No No No No No No

Pinhead stands very still and speaks very calmly

PINHEAD
Curb your tongue

The Elder Cops body starts to move involuntarily His
movements are jerky and spasmodic as if his mind is trying
to
new-

control

open

panicked

makes

along

distance

fight what his body is trying to do
Pinheads head moves through various positions His face is
calm showing no particular pleasure at what he is doing but

only a fascinated concentration as if experimenting with

found skills

The Elder Copts shaking puppet-like hands draw his handcuffs
from his belt

His eyes show terror Everything else is beyond his

He raises the cuffs to head level and springs one of them

His mouth suddenly jerks open and his tongue protrudes

The fear in his eyes increases

He moves the open cuff over his tongue Hes making
moaning noises as if trying to scream

SLAM He drives the cuff closed right through his tongue
And SCREAMS (as best he can)

Pinhead looks beyond the Cop to the wall of blackness and
another commanding gesture with his head

A Chain flies from the darkness and wraps itself around the
other cuff

The chain pulls taut and then suddenly retracts into the
darkness hauling the Cop off his feet and dragging him

the alley into the blackness

The Cop screams and moans all the way until he is enveloped
into the darkness and then the sounds suddenly stop dead

one of the pins from his skull
The pin is horribly long and sickeningly the last few

arent metal at all but some kind of infernal worm - dark
slimy and befanged

Pinhead presses the worm against his palm and it instantly
burrows through his flesh pulling its pin-tail behind it

repeats the operation with the other palm

He turns his palms out to show the Priest in a blasphemous
parody of Christs stigmata

PINHEAD
I am the Way

The Priest rushes up to the altar to Pinhead

PRIEST
Youll burn in Hell for this

The Priest reaches him Pinheads hand is on his throat
instantly squeezing silence from him

PINHEAD
Burn What a limited imagination

The choking Priest kicks and struggles as Pinhead forces him
his knees before him
Pinhead towers over the Priest He smiles
With his free hand he gouges out a piece of his own flesh
the decorative wounds on his chest He holds the bloody
of meat up

Joey closes her door and switches on the light The mood is
suddenly different after the frenzied drive across town

very still very slow very quiet

Perhaps its too quiet Joey moves into the room slowly
clutching the Box in her hands and glancing round Her

makes the mood suddenly creepy Is the monster already in
house

Very slowly very carefully Joey begins to move round her
apartment Hardly breathing making no sudden movements

checks her doors The kitchen empty The bedroom
empty The bathroom empty

Joey stands back in the center of her main room facing out
her big picture window Slowly she lets out a big breath

then draws an equally slow one in Maybe its alright
maybe the monster isnt here maybe

Magically eerily slowly the Box begins to rise from

Joeys

hand Her eyes stare in horror as it ascends through the
air

JOEY
Oh shit

Maybe theres one place she hasnt checked Swallowing

nervously Joey tilts her head up and back her eyes rising
up

in their sockets

The camera tilts low low lower taking in a wider

view of the room and its ceiling and the ascending Box

And the audience screams

Like a spider or a lizard Pinhead is flat against the
ceiling

arms stretched out for balance his face staring down at
Joey

Joey throws her hands to her mouth and screams

Pinhead angling down feet first floats elegantly to the
floor

to stand facing Joey The Box lands in one of his
outstretched

hands He holds it out to show Joey and then suddenly

closes his powerful hand on it apparently crushing it

He flings the remnants from him and they land on Joeys
floor -

Chunks and splinters of wood whirring and spinning
machinery

of gold and silver and scores of tiny writhing worms

Suddenly a khaki-uniformed arm moves into shot and grasps
Pinheads hand arm-wrestling style

WIDER ANGLE (WITH OPTICAL FX)
Elliott literally pulls Pinhead through from one reality to
another - we see parts of the monster appearing and
disappearing in front of the Hut wall as if glimpsed through
tears in reality Its like a tug-of-war which Elliott wins
Suddenly Pinheads there on the floor of the Quonset hut
And his other self - Elliott - still has hold of his hand
Pinhead throws a glance around the Hut He recognizes it
and the frozen figure at the top end perched before the Box

Joey runs around then to the far wall - just in time because
now the pyrotechnics start

Elliott tightens his grip and (with a nice series of
CLOSE-UPS of these two alternative selves) the life-forces
Elliott and Pinhead begin to erupt

VARIOUS ANGLES ON THE THREE SELVES - PINHEAD ELLIOTT AND
SEATED OFFICER

The essences of Pinhead and Elliott - drawn from their

as sweeping glowing spitting arcs of BLUE LIGHT - crackle
the air of the Hut like a miniature electrical storm

Until they suddenly lock together in one more powerful arc
which flies at the body of the seated Officer and disappears

inside him in a BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT

And suddenly as vision returns there is only the seated
officer (and at the far end of the room Joey)

And almost as suddenly the frozen scene comes to life
The radio near the camp bed is playing

A bead of sweat falls down the Officers face as he reaches
forward to pick up the Box

The Officer apparently completely unaware of Joeys
begins to work the Box
As the process works through we INTERCUT CONSTANTLY BETWEEN

1) The Officers hands and the movements of the Box here in
the Hut in 1921

2) EXACTLY MATCHING movements of the Box back on the floor

Joeys apartment in 1992 Moving on its own linked across
years to its earlier self

3) Joey watching the movements in the Hut

hear me can you Its 1921 Im not

Suddenly small patterns of BLUE LIGHT arc across the Box
shocking the Officer who drops the Box and then stares in

shock

and fascination as

On the floor the box begins to open

The Officer kneels up and leans over the Box

And the chains fly Shooting up from within and hooking

themselves cruelly into the Officers face and chest

She crosses the floor without glancing down at it Why
should

she Everythings over But we notice even if she
doesnt

register this before
Joey opens the kitchen door

Pinhead is framed in the doorway

Behind him instead of her kitchen is the black space of

full of shadowy pillars and chains

Oh no kiss of welcome after 70 years
Joey backs away shaking her head in shocked denial
Pinhead moves forward very leisurely
PINHEAD
This will be so good Joey You loved
him didnt you I can feel him inside
weeping for you He can watch through
the centuries as we discover the things
that make you whimper
Joeys mood breaks and she turns and rushes for her front
door
She reaches it throws it open and screams

JP Monroe is in the doorway - but hes only just
recognizable

Hes now a CENOBITE - blue-skinned scarred mutilated and

decorated with metal and leather

Pinhead and JP are advancing across the room toward Joey and
Terri Joey only has seconds to act

JOEY
Wanna light you bitch

Joey pulls her fathers Zippo from her pocket and sparks it
as she swings it through the air close to Terris face

A huge FLAME shoots out of the Zippo (as in the earlier

and scours across Terris face

Terri howls in terror throws her hands to her face and
Box flies from her hands

Joey catches it spins it closes it

An arc of BLUE LIGHT zaps across to Terri and shes gone
Still in one movement swinging on her heels Joey twists
box again

And another Arc of LIGHT zaps JP away
