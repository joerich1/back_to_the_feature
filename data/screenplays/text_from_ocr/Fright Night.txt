FRIGHT NIGHT

Written by

Marti Noxon

EXT SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD -- NIGHT

FADE UP
Moving through a tract development The houses are like
Mexican food -- the basic elements are all the same just

mixed differently

A gloomy night no moon And a slightly ominous pattern
emerges

Green thriving lawns and meticulously tended homes abut
brown yards and porches littered with old newspapers and
pizza joint flyers

Each third or fourth house is FOR SALE or worse seemingly
abandoned This area is in danger of becoming a ghost town
A deep commanding voice pierces the silence

VOICE (0S)

Defy reason Defy everything you

know

Now we move in on one of the homes Not the nicest on the
block but inhabited Lights on in the windows

INT SUBURBAN HOMEVARIOUS -- NIGHT

Inside the house A middle-class family lives here The
living room is empty but the TVs on

ON THE TELEVISION

A commercial for PETER VINCENT A Las Vegas institution
hes a magician whose show is all Gothic horror-movie
imagery

Peters wiry hot -- a rock and roll bad boy Hes cutting a
girl up with a chain saw And grinning like a mad man

TELEVISION ANNOUNCER
Peter Vincents FRIGHT NIGHT
The family DOG is up on the coffee table eating whats left
of a fast food burger and fries still in the box

TELEVISION ANNOUNCER (CONTD)
Somethings moving in the dark

Also on the table -- a role-playing game in progress
Magic the Gathering Elves and Wizards

TELEVISION ANNOUNCER (CONTD)

Only at The Hard Rock Nightly

Wednesday Through Sunday

Now we hear what at first sounds like a MUFFLED ARGUMENT
coming from another room

DISTANT VOICE
Get off her
More voices yelling something being thrown An ugly
domestic scene
We creep down a dark hall toward a cracked door light seeps

through the opening -- it SLAMS OPEN and ADAM 17 crashes
toward us

Hes nice-looking a little nerdy -- and hes in a blind
terror

We get a glimpse of the horrible scene behind the door A
teen girls room -- the sound of flesh ripping

We see a pale arm on the ground shaking violently as if
something is tearing and tugging at the body attached to it
We bolt away with ADAM who we now see is blood splattered
as he races UPSTAIRS A PHONE CRADLE is ripped out of the
wall which Adam nearly falls over

INT SUBURBAN HOME -- UPPER LANDINGBEDROOM -- NIGHT
ADAM RACES INTO HIS PARENTS ROOM Another horrible glimpse

- his mothers body splayed across her frilly bed

Blood on pale pink sheets

ADAM goes to his FATHERS SIDE OF THE BED and now we see
Adams fathers body His father was reaching for A GUN hed
hidden under the bed

ADAM gets down under the bed desperately reaches for the
gun Its just beyond his grasp

ADAM
Come on come on come on
He gets it But the GUN HAS A GUN LOCK Adam has to dig in
his dead fathers pockets for his keys Adam starts to cry
bikes

ADAM (CONTD)
Come on come on
He finds them struggles to unlock the gun with shaking
hands
THE BED IS TURNED OVER in one violent throw Adam is
exposed We see only a hint of the creature that looms over

HIM --
Brutally strong veins dark and visible under the skin
Human but not quite
Adam reacts in horror He knows hes dead
HEs RIPPED OUT OF FRAME as we hear

DISC JOCKEY (0S)

were looking at a nice day here
in Clark County hitting a season
low of only 89 degrees

EXT SHADOW HILLS - DAY

MUSIC starts under the DISC JOCKEY as we LOOK DOWN FROM HIGH
ABOVE at the SAME suburban neighborhood as before

In the daylight it seems nice Charming even

Pocket parks decorate almost every corner and kids ride

in the street Mothers unload groceries Neighbors chat

DISC JOCKEY (0S)

-so get out there and enjoy this

beautiful Wednesday people

We SWOOP CLOSER and find that RADIO comes from a passing
MINIVAN with those cutesy stick figure family decals on the
rear window

The FOR SALE SIGNS and brown lawns dont seem nearly so
foreboding now

We SWOOP UP AGAIN and see beyond Shadow Hills past the WALL
that encompasses it -- and become aware for the first time
that the community is SURROUNDED BY FLAT ARID DESERT

In the distance we can just make out the glow of Las Vegas
proper It looks like a distant fantasy a land-locked
Pleasure Island
who

across

EXT STREET - DAY

CLOSE ON
The wheels of a DIRT BIKE as it zooms down the street
WIDEN to see CHARLIE BREWSTER who is PUSHING the bike as
fast as he can It STARTS sputters -- then craps out

CHARLIE
(to the bikepissed)
You want me to take you apart huh
Charlies 17 and has the slightly awkward feel of someone

just recently came into his body and good looks
Hes a wry thoughtful kid whos enjoying -- but not quite
trusting -- a sudden surge in popularity

CHARLIE (CONTD)
(still talking to bike)
I will Ill sell you for parts
Dont think I wont--
Charlie stops embarrassed DORIS -- a neighbor -- watches
him talk to his bike Paused as she hauls her trash cans to
the curb
Shes super pretty in a wholesome way -- except for her
ridiculous body Stripper city She nods to the bike
amused

DORIS
Nothing doing huh

CHARLIE
The things got no ambition
(re trash cans)

Can I -- uh give you a hand
DORIS
I got it Thanks
She walks away -- her sweatpants have the word LUCKY

the butt He watches her go appreciatively Doesnt notice
his mom JANE struggling to pull their own cans to the

curb
JANE
Dont leer at the neighbors kid
Jane 40s attractive and frazzled wears a REAL ESTATE
brokers blazer Charlie wheels his bike back to the curb

He and his mom have had an affectionate teasing
relationship

which has only recently started to have more edge

CHARLIE
Shes the one who put a word on her
butt Im just reading it
Jane eyes a LARGE DUMPSTER FULL OF CONCRETE that sits in
front of their NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS YARD

JANE
Is he ever going to move that
thing

CHARLIE

You need to get over it Mom
JANE

(WATCH IT)

CHARLIE

JANE
Amy

CHARLIE

He says this like hes surprised Jane nods Getting it
JANE

and handsome

(THEN)
Getting what you want is stressful
Especially when youre not used to
it More to lose

CHARLIE
Are you reading those books again
The Power of Whatever the Hell
She laughs He glances at the DUMPSTER

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Theyre not working Youre still
flipping out about a big box

Now Jane moves to the open garage and starts loading OPEN
HOUSE SIGNS into her trunk Charlie stands there She
shoots him a look -- then he helps her load

JANE

convince people to move in not
join the legions leaving town--

CHARLIE

JANE

The guy moves in and puts a giant

trash can in his yard When the

Perrys lived there--

Charlie has heard this before Its a common refrain

fq

CHARLIE

The Perrys were the greatest
neighbors ever But they moved I
thought you were happy their place

fq
JANE
(back on the neighbor)
Hes not digging a pool Where do
you think all that concretes
coming from

CHARLIE
Youre spying on the guy now

JANE
Hes thirteen feet from our house
Thats not spying thats

A BEETLE CONVERTIBLE pulls up AMY drives and her two hot
friends CARA and BEE sit in the back

AMY

JANE
Hi honey Hi girls
ANY 16 is a stunner And shes as cool as she is beautiful
-- the girl every other guy in school would die to be with

But Charlie is And he cant believe his luck Which puts
him off his game She makes him feel like hes always
playing catch up

Charlie moves toward the VW Jane calls after him

JANE (CONTD)
Oh hey -- Ed called Again

CHARLIE

JANE

Im tired of making excuses
Charlie If you dont want to talk
to him would you please tell him

CHARLIE
Kinda defeats the purpose
He gets to AMY and the girls Amy glances at the dirt bike

CHARLIE
Wow No faith

AMY

Amy calls his bluff and starts to drive off Charlie grabs
his backpack and RACES after her

CHARLIE
No hey stop--
She laughs stops the car Charlie tries to jump in and she
drives again

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Come on Hey--
Charlie runs and finally dives into the back headfirst The
girls are laughing

ON JANE
Watching them drive off gone in a cloud of teen spirit

Ed gripping his duffle bag nervously skates down a
residential street Houses here are spaced far apart and the

the lock gets it open and runs into the backyard
EXT BACKYARD -- NIGHT

Ed races for the back gate--

AND SUDDENLY JERKS TO A STOP

Jerry has him by the back of the CROSS hes wearing

Eds lifted WAY off his feet by the CHAIN until hes
choking

on it the cross directly under his neck

JERRY looks away as he SNAPS the chain off Ed and HURLS the

cross into the neighbors POOL

Ed falls to the ground watches the cross sink in despair

Jerrys standing over him Smiles a little We get just a

flash -- he suddenly has MORE TEETH sharper in rows Its

chilling

JERRY
Bit off more than you can chew
Shaking terrified Ed brandishes the STAKE

ED
Well see man I know my shit
But Jerry doesnt appear to be afraid He looks at Ed with
actual sympathy

JERRY

Eds shaken -- but still grips the stake Holding on
ED

Eds room is a shrine to comic books horror and fantasy

Theres an art table where Ed has been working on some

and looks at them Theyre fantastic

He looks at the photos on the wall -- including a few
pictures of Ed Charlie and Adam when they were friends

and thinner -- with really bad acne Not cute WAY not

ON CHARLIE
Ouch Best not to dwell He turns and sees--
PETER VINCENTS FRIGHT NIGHT POSTER on a wall Charlie
takes it in laughs a little
Then Charlie examines a WHOLE WALL devoted to Eds
investigation of Jerry Maps news reports vampire lore
printed off the internet books etc

If you didnt know the difference youd say its just more
of Eds fictional world

Charlie stares at it all for a beat Then shakes his head
Its all a fantasy -- nothing more

CHARLIE
This is crazy
He starts to take off But sees that Eds computer is on --
and one file stands out THE JERRY DIARIES
Charlie gives in to his curiosity -- clicks it open -- finds
a bunch of Quicktime files
He opens one Stops

Listening and watching intently Keeping sentry

A short while later Charlie moves cautiously into Jerrys

backyard Hes wearing ALL BLACK and his dads old winter
gloves He looks at his iPhone
ON THE PHONE -- a diagram How to pick a lock

Charlie steels his nerves At Jerrys back door he clumsily
tries to pick the lock After a moment or two he realizes
he has no idea what hes doing

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Crap
He walks away from the door frustrated Then turns and
impulsively tries to KICK IN the DOOR with his foot Nothing
happens
Then something occurs to Charlie He goes into the garden

Charlie finds a FAKE ROCK Turns it over It has a KEY in
it Charlies like -- duh
He puts the key in the back door lock It opens

INT JERRYS HOUSE - NIGHT

Charlie moves through the first story of the house Hes
cautious on edge

At first the place seems totally unremarkable A typical
guy pad Lots of inexpensive furniture bad art a salt
water fish tank

At every turn Charlie expects something or someone to jump
out at him Its unbearably tense

INT JERRYS HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS -- NIGHT

Charlie looks upstairs Moves through a plain white hallway
finds an open door that leads to Jerrys office where he
keeps an EXTENSIVE LIBRARY

On one wall hangs a TAPESTRY that looks very old decorated
with a strange INSIGNIA Charlie takes a picture of it with
his phone

Charlie tugs on the door Locked

DORIS
Please No Dont go

Charlie ducks inside one of the CELLS across from Doris
moves behind the door

JERRY steps into the hallway walks right by Charlies

place Pauses near him

The door is ajar Was it that way before Charlie holds his
breath

Jerry moves to the CELL and retrieves DORISs half-alive

from it
Charlie cautiously looks through the crack in the door

DORIS (CONTD)
-no God no please
The door to Doriss cell open Charlie can see PART of
Doriss body and face
Jerry is mostly obscured bent over Doris -- holding her
Charlie watches helplessly horrified

DORIS (CONTD)
Please please dont kill me
Doriss body TENSES and starts to jerk as Jerry TUGS AND
RIPS AT IT SAVAGELY Its clear hes FEEDING ON HER
although we cant see his face
Doris screams then starts to cry Its stark and REAL and
terrifying
It seems to go on and on Doris weakens her head lolling to
one side her light fading
A small stream of blood spreads across the white pavement
In the position shes in she is eye to eye with CHARLIE
She sees him smiles weakly Then mouths something -- too
weak to make much sound

DORIS (CONTD)
Cha Cha
CHARLIE is petrified Doris gets it -- smiles a little
grimly puts a finger to her lips Silence
After what seems like an eternity Jerry is satisfied He
tosses Doris aside and stands away from her
Charlie DUCKS behind the door as Jerry emerges and casually

tiny

wipes a spot of blood from his mouth

Then Jerry LOCKS DORIS back into her cell Pockets the key
and moves off toward the stairs After a moment hes gone
The sound of a TV starts in Jerrys living room Something
banal like The Real Housewives of Orange County

Charlie knows this is his moment With shaking hands he
retrieves his iPhone and pulls up the HOW TO PICK A LOCK
screen

Charlie looks through the window in Doriss cell Shes
breathing -- alive

Charlie whispers to himself as he uses a bobby pin and a

screwdriver on the lock

CHARLIE
Please Please
The bobby pin slips Drops Charlies losing it Steadies
himself Tries again

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Come on
The tension is unbearable Charlie can hear JERRY moving
downstairs

CLICK
The lock slides open Charlie breathes with relief Then he
grabs Doris and BOLTS
Charlie SLIPS in a pool of blood left behind from Jerrys
feeding but he manages to stay on his feet
He pushes Doris ahead of him to a BACK STAIRCASE
His PHONE drops out of his pocket he has to double back --
every moment counts Doriss barely aware of whats
happening let alone where she is

INT JERRYS HOUSE -- STAIRWELLENTRY -- DAWN

A moment later Charlie and Doris emerge downstairs near
the entry hall They can see the front door -- and hear
Jerry moving in another room

Charlie looks around trying to get oriented

JERRY emerges -- almost sees them Charlie ducks into a
hiding spot and grabs Doris covering her mouth
stop

A long beat as Jerry returns to the living room with a beer
Settles in a chair facing away from the door

Charlie considers his options Says almost silently

CHARLIE
Same floor plan
He grabs Doris and bolts for the kitchen

INT JERRYS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- DAWN

A back door Leading out Charlie and Doris race for it

gratitude and relief manages--

Doris looks up at him her EYES TURNING BLACK her veins
going gray A first ray of pure sunlight hits them

CHARLIE REACTS
Horrified In shock

his Renfield Funny if you--
Ed starts to VIBRATE HORRIBLY his WHOLE BODY moving so
impossibly fast hes little more than a BLUR
Then he BURNS UP FROM THE INSIDE OUT
Charlies paralyzed -- in a world of hurt
Amy grabs him Pulls him out of the room

AMY

INT PETERS PENTHOUSE -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT

JERRY VAMP-FACED and recovering from the holy water sees
AMY and CHARLIE running up ahead

He sprints after them Charlie sees him and TOPPLES A GIANT
FIGURINE in his path as well as cabinets etc

They slow Jerry down enough to get slightly ahead

AMY

OVER HERE--
She flings the door to the stairwell open and they RACE DOWN

THE STAIRS
INT PETERS PANIC ROOM -- NIGHT
Peter sits huddled in a corner ashamed and shaking

The SECURITY CAMERA flicks through different rooms until it
lands on his dead cousin ARTHUR
CASINO

Its like Peters looking at his own mutilated corpse
OFF PETER terrified

INT CASINO -- NIGHT

Amy and Charlie emerge from the stairway
They find themselves ON THE FLOOR of a HARD ROCK TYPE

which is on the bottom of the building where Peter lives
Amy slows as they fold into the crowds Relieved

AMY

a dark corner etc Its loud chaotic

AMY

CHARLIE

Now Charlie sees JERRY some distance behind them now moving
toward them in the crowd They meet eyes
Charlie grabs Amy scans for someplace to hide He spots a
nightclub -- REFLECTIONS
The outside walls are all mirrored like a brightly lit
diamond

ON JERRY
Behind them in the crowd he sees them slip into the club
INT REFLECTIONS - NIGHT

he dance floor is PACKED All writhing bodies and sweaty
bandon

harlie sees JERRY enter look around for them The best bet
o get lost is to dive into the crowd

harlie leads Amy through the throngs of people -- the
ifferent levels of the club are like a maze Glass
taircases lead to mirrored balconies

hopped-up DJ climbs up on a balcony starts throwing t-
hirts into the crowd

Charlie cant see Amy instead sees HIMSELF over and over
again in a series of mirrors -- the infinity effect

Its dizzying disorienting

THEN HE SEES JERRY a shark moving in and out of the crowd
disappearing behind mirrored columns reemerging

Charlie also sees that JERRY DOESNT REFLECT in the mirrors
around them Instead the crowd parts as if by magic

Jerrys heading straight toward--

AMY

spinning looking desperately for Charlie

CHARLIE (CONTD)

Charlies frantically pushing toward her But the CRUSH of
people makes it nearly impossible to gain ground

CLOSE ON AMY
As a HAND slips into hers She turns relieved to find--

JERRY
Holding her with a firm grip

AMY
No No
Amy STRUGGLES and CRIES OUT as JERRY PULLS HER away from
CHARLIE toward ramp that leads to another dance floor
Jerry laughs throws her over his shoulder

AMY (CONTD)

night in Vegas

GUY
Go get her man
AMY sees her fast-moving reflection in the mirror -- she
appears to be FLOATING above the people

AMY
Help me Help
CHARLIE can SEE HER but cant get to her The crowd is
indifferent to her cries

exposes his brutal rows of TEETH for just an instant

JERRY (CONTD)
Come on
He grips her harder sways with her to the music Leans
close to her ear seductive
His predatory skills in high gear

JERRY (CONTD)
You just need a taste Youll see
It can be like a dream
Jerry draws a nail over his wrist draws a line of blood He
puts his mouth over the cut bloodying it
He forces her into a DEEP KISS She struggles mightily --
but then her body relaxes as if shes been sedated

JERRY (CONTD)
Thats it Good girl
JERRY looks up sees CHARLIE coming toward them
But Amys altered now Staring into Jerrys eyes like a

PETER

CHARLIE
You call this surviving If you

PETER
I know I wont I never could --

This stops Charlie

PETER (CONTD)
I told myself I probably made it

easier to believe in monsters

CHARLIE
Made what up

PETER
The vampire who killed my parents

Charlie reacts Surprised but now it all makes
Peter continues haunted--

PETER (CONTD)
I didnt collect all this stuff for

CHARLIE
So do it Well go in at dawn

PETER (CONTD)
You think Im a coward Im just a
realist
Moment of hesitation for Charlie Has he been affected by
Peters words Then--

CHARLIE
So you bail on people erase them

(THEN)
I dont want to make it to
tomorrow not if youre the kind of
man I have to be
A moment Peter is full of self-loathing but resolved
Charlie turns to leave

PETER
Wait
Peter takes something from his luggage A stake carved from
WHITE WOOD He hands it to Charlie

PETER (CONTD)
Blessed by Saint Michael Killa
vampire with it -- its supposed to
turn his victims back If Amys
changed you can still save her

CHARLIE

(RE STAKE)
If its for real

PETER
Who knows whats for real any more
Charlie takes the stake Starts to go Peter stops him--

PETER (CONTD)
Theres no guarantee hell be
asleep during the day Hes
housebound not hibernating
CHARLIE
Ill figure it out

PETER
No you need a plan To stake him
you have to get close -- hes

stronger than you

CHARLIE
Holy water

PETER
Slow him down Wont stop him

(THEN)
Torch him youll have a few good
minutes before he really goes up
Believe me a vampire on fire isnt
thinking clearly

CHARLIE
But if hes on fire how do I get
close enough to stake him

A beat
PETER

CHARLIE
(POINTED )

You just worry about yourself
With that Charlie leaves
Off PETER Disgusted with himself

INT HOSPITAL - NIGHTDAY

Charlie sits by Janes bedside Shes still comatose
We move closer and see that Charlies drawing a MAP OF
JERRYS HOUSE on some scrap paper -- laying it out from
memory as best he can
He GLANCES at the clock as it ticks toward DA
As Charlie plots he talks to Jane -- his silent confidante

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Those rooms upstairs thats
probably where hes got Amy
I get her out assuming shes--

(NOT DEAD)
Then I have to get him on the
ropes
He thinks Then looks up an idea occurring Jane lies

there peacefully

CHARLIE (CONTD)

More energized Charlie stands and gathers his things
He stops contemplates his mother for a moment -- regretful

CHARLIE (CONTD)

CHARLIE stands on the front lawn contemplating the houses

He wears fireproof clothes has stakes and crosses strapped

to him holsters made out of duct-tape

Slung over his shoulder is the spray canister And he holds

He swallows hard scared but determined

INT JERRYS HOUSE -- FIRST FLOOR -- DAY

CLOSE ON WET FOOTPRINTS
Widen to find Charlie cautiously moving through the house
The blacked-out windows give the place a gray stifled air

him to jump out and go for his throat

He takes the stairs up to the second floor two at a time

another roomstorage area

ON CHARLIE
As he sees something Stops
A MOUND of dirt Like a grave

Peter looks at him

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Flame retardant
Theyre standing over the grave now Both nervous
Charlie nods to Peter Peter does his best to hold the
shotgun on the grave as he pushes the dirt aside with his
free hand Hes shaking

After a moment Peter UNCOVERS PART OF THE BODY Then he
moves up toward the face

Charlie douses the body with liquid from the canister
CHARLIE (CONTD)

nearly overtaken by a wide mouth filled with razor-sharp
teeth Her eyes are crazed and blood-red

Its gruesome and terrifying

Charlie sees THE STAKE at the lip of the hole Dives for it
Amys on him in a flash She throws him to the ground Hes

Peter gets up painfully moves to help
Raging and desperate -- Charlie and Jerry continue to

Finally Jerry pulls Charlie down with him --rolls on the
ground as they fight Trying to put out the flames

Jerry starts to DISINTEGRATE -- hes about to EXPLODE into
bits Charlies stake is now ON FIRE

CHARLIE

NO
A last desperate attempt He can see Jerrys HEART about to
burn away

HE STAKES JERRY

AMY suddenly SCREAMS - shes burning inside DYING Or so it
seems The vampire is being burned out of her

PETER cries out too reacting less violently But in pain
JERRY
Still burning looks down as the STAKE OF SAINT MICHAEL in
his CHEST Right through the heart

He starts to SHAKE VIOLENTLY -- faster and faster just like
Ed did -- becoming little more than a macabre BLUR
For a moment -- Jerrys human form hangs in the air
JERRY
Blow me

THEN HE BLOWS INTO A MILLION PIECES

ON CHARLIE AND PETER

Thinking fast PETER tackles CHARLIE -- who is still in
flames They tumble into one of the open graves

DIRT pours in around them extinguishing the fire

ON AMY
Transformed and healed Herself again She rushes to the
edge of the open grave

ABOVE THE OPEN GRAVE
Peter pulls Charlies mask back Charlie is burned
unconscious
