OUT OF DARKNESS
Fade up 8 title card

In 1883 the voicano on the Indonesian island
of Krakatoa erupted showering the world
with dust As this debris fell slowly to earth
it led to a number of strange atmospheric
effects In 1888 the city of London
witnessed increasingly bizarre sunsets -
green and blood red skies Contemporary
accounts describe it as an unusually
lightless year In retrospect it seems
entirely appropriate

Whoosh The screen erupts in orange and red flame We pull back to reveal -

A STREET VENDOR

fires up a brazier starting to roast chestnuts and squirrels over the flames Unsean
by him two urchins crouch under the barrow trying to capture some of the
warmth Its dusk - a blood red sky turns to purple as night falls

Silhouetted against it is a grim and awful church The massive portico and tower are
deliberataly out of proportion designed to instill a sense of fear in those who enter
its name is Christchurch and it stands in the heart of Whitechapel

This is the armpit of London - grim Victorian tenements dark alleys and lanes 8
filthy pub on every corner The streets are crowded with the poor and desperate
Scores of prostitutes ranging in age from the early teens to the late 40s work the
sidewalks and alleys looking for trade

4 SHOP WINDOW

throws a wedge of light across Dorset Street Several prostitutes look in at the
cheap bonnets and shoes Among them is a woman in her early 20s - shes poorly
dressed shy looking Her face is beautiful - she has auburn hair that falls to her
shoulders and large bright eyes Her name is Mary Kelly Like the other women she
is tired and hungry - trying to make a living the only way she can

An unshaven bear of 8 man approaches Under his jacket he wears a feather apron -
hes a butcher Despite his appearance several of the women put on their most
attractive smiles None of them can afford to be choosy

The butcher eyes the women up and down appraising them Then he sees Mary
anc smiles

MARY
Theres a lane ‘round the back - you do

The Butcher looks around - a narrow alley leads between two tenements

BUTCHER
Its dark is it

MARY
Dark enough

He smiles at her - then reaches up and rings an imaginary bell

BUTCHER
Ding Ding All aboard

Mary turns and leads him into the afley

A SADOLE MAKERS YARD

Mary and the Butcher move through the shadows behind the tenements - a
workshop and stables form a courtyard Alleys and passageways run off of it
Another prostitute enters the courtyard In her 30s with raven hair and eyes like jet
she looks sassy - a half open blouse and a pert bonnet tied under her chin This is
Annie Chapman - Dark Annie to her friends

MARY
Hello Annie -

Dark Annie cant see clearly in the gloom She comes forward peering -

MARY
It’s Mary Mary Kelly

DARK ANNIE
Hello Mary Hows tricks If youre going
to Dutfield Yard be careful - theres a
drunk fallen down in the doorway

MARY
Thanks Annie

As thay go their separate ways we crane up the slums behind the tenements
stretch forever - a maze of allays broken down hovels and towering walls

DARK ANNIE

steps into a covered passageway littered with garbege Smiling she starts to play
hopscotch over the trash

DARK ANNIE
One two buckle my shoe Three four
shut the door

A man steps into frame Silently he watches Dark Annie from behind In his hand
he carries a knife Annie skips forward into -

A MARKET YARD

Its deserted now - empty barrows and wagons line the walls blocking the only exit
Dark Annie curses at having to retrace her steps She turns - straight into the man
He slashes with the knife It cuts straight across her throat - her bonnet flutters to
the ground

Annie keeps staring at the man Oh hes good with the blade - hes cut the bonnet
clean off her chin and not even scratched the skin He pulls her face close to his
Hes 8 young man - dead eyes and a4 cruel smite

He jerks her head back laying open her throat and breasts A sound behind Annie
She rolls her eyes back - two men emerge from the shadows and stand at back of
her One of them is obviously the leader This is McQueen

THREE PENNIES

are thrown to the ground We are in Dutfield’s Yard a small and shadowy area next
to a warehouse Mary bends and picks up the money The Butcher pulls aside his
apron getting ready to take her A sound in the shadows sort of like a gasping -
Annie staggers into the yard clutching her blouse across her chest

DARK ANNIE

THE RINGERS

is a down-at-heel pub on the corner of Dorset and Crispin Streets Its real name as
it still is today - is The Britannia The nickname comes from the proprietors - Walter
Ringer and his wife Annie lies on a couch a sheet draped from the rafters gives a
little privacy from the drinkers The wound across her chest has just been bandaged

The toca Doctor washes the blood and iodine from his hands Two policemen Mary
and several other more experienced prostitutes watch -

DOCTOR LEWELLYN
tl heal well enough She just needs
to bathe it every day - no doubt thatll
come as quite a shock Ive left some
laudanum for the pain

He packs his equipment into his bag Annie reaches in to her purse and drops a
couple of pennies in his hand - thats all the money shes got The Doctor looks at
the other women waiting They all contribute - Mary pulls out the three soiled
pennies and hands it over

DOCTOR LEWELLYN
Glad to be of service Good night ladies

He steps through the sheet The senior policeman turns to Annie -

SERGEANT
I need to get a staternent from you

DARK ANNIE
What - and itll be my throat thats cut
tomorrow No thank you Sergeant
Theres laws down here in the East End
but theyre not made by coppers

Several of the other prostitutes nod in agreement

SERGEANT

One of the women laughs This is Polly Nichols Shes s good hearted woman in her
late 20s A crooked smile gives her a cock-eyed impish look -

He picks up his jacket turns and walks out

A MAGNIFICENT HOUSE

it’s a grand Nash-designed terrace in Belgravia - all pillars and balustrades Through
a huge window we see a sparkling chandelier -

IN THE DRAWING ROOM

are about thirty people - men in black tie the women in satin and jewels its after
dinner and the butler serves drinks and cigars A man near the fireplace turns and
takes a brandy balloon Hes in his early 30s handsome a little out of his depth in
such glittering company But theres a strength about him a cool intelligence in his
eyes that makes you feel if there was trouble youd want him on your side This is
Fred Abberline

On the other side of the room is Sir Charles Warren the Commissioner of Police He
is in his 60s gray-haired strong in appearance but weak in character He is talking
to a big elderly woman dressed in layers of cream silk She looks like a galleon in
full sail -

LADY ROSSIE

something Tell me what brings a man
like him to the attention of the Police

Good God no

SIR CHARLES
I dont recommend it There’s seventy
thousand people crammed into five
square miles Unemployment is over
sixty per cent - and that’s among the
men There’s nothing for the women
Nothing at all not unless you count
Starvation of a profession which good
manners precludes me from mentioning
The Black Hole of Calcutta - its here in
the heart of London Imagine the son of
man that has brought at least some order
to it Thats Inspector Abberline Hes an
outstanding officer mlady

LADY ROSSIE
smiling

Apparently so And now youre going to
turn him loose on us wicked dowagers
of Belgravia Of course this place is full
of crime too but as everybody knows -
up here we at least have the good taste
to keep it behind closed doors Dont you
think your inspector may be a trifle bored

SIR CHARLES
shouldnt think so Mr Abberlines very
ambitious - this is a wonderful opportunity
for him He’s already an inspector at
thirty-four - who knows at this rate hell
have my job before he’s done

LADY ROSSIE
Then its just as well he works hard -
thats a high bar for anyone to clear

Sir Charles gives a little bow acknowledging the compliment

LADY ROSSIE
When does he start

SIR CHARLES
Not for a couple of months but thought
we should get him acclimatized The air
up in the Wast End can be quite rarefied

AT THE FIREPLACE

Abberline is with a group about to play cards One of the men shuffies the two
packs - nonchalantly he fires the cards from one hand to the other fans them in
mid-sir cuts them and fans them again Hes in his late 30s - rich and arrogant
This is the seventh Ear of Pembroke - Duchy to his friends He speaks to Abberline -

DUCHY
Would you care to shuffle Im sorry
cant recall your name

ABBERLINE
Abberline Fred Abberline dont know any
tricks can play thats about all

DUCHY
Surprising would have thought a
member of the constabulary would have
known a lot more tricks than us fess
worldly people think youre being shy
Come on - dazzie us

Before Abberline can answer a middle-aged man who has spent his life with the
bottle interrupts Pouring himself another cognac he speaks to the Ear -

WILLY
Leave it off Duchy What would you
know about “the constabulary” anyway

DUCHY

(evenly)
Youre quite right of course Willy - Ive
never actually met a policeman before

He turns back to Abberline His smile is even more patronizing than his words -

WILLY
Light me up will you Frederick

He puts a large Havana in his mouth and points at a glowing taper lying in the
fireplace The two men look at each other The other members of the group watch
Among them is the hostess She is 29 very beautiful and quite spoilt - ten years
previously she inherited a fortune Her name is Lady Jane DUrbanville and right
now her eyes are totally on the handsome Abberline

A beat - then Abberline turns and reaches for the taper So - he gives in Duchy
smiles and leans forward with the cigar waiting for the light

ABBERLINE
Actually there is one trick know

DUCHY
Really You must show us -

Abberline knocks back his entire glass of cognac - and spits A stream of liquor
arches towards the cigar Abberline touches the glowing taper to it - the liquor
bursts into flame It looks like Abberline is breathing fire The stream of fiame lights
the end of the cigar and dias The rest of the group stere in amazement - then Lady
Jane claps and cheers The others join in Duchy touchas his singed forehead -

DUCHY
Those were my eyebrows

ABBERLINE
Sorry The tricks a bit like me guess - it
needs a little refinement

WILLY
Damn fine trick it you ask me Far better
than that crap with the cards

Lady Jane catches Abberline’s eye - they smile at one another And Lady Jane
keeps smiling - long enough for Willy to note her interest in Abberline

A ROW OF CARRIAGES

is drawn up in front of the mansion - the guests are leaving Lady Jane stands at the
drawing room window Only a few intimate friends remain She watches Abberline
get into Sir Charles’ coach Willy takes Lady Janes hand -

Its funny though he said his father was
the doctor at High Wycombe When
Was young my family had a place there
Damned if can recall the doctor having
8 son

LADY JANE
You were probably drunk thats why

Another woman has been listening She turns to Lady Jane -

VIOLET
How could you Jane You heard Willy -
he said he was just a child You didnt
become a drunk until much later did
you darling

WILLY
No Janes right Im afraid realized
very early drinkings like sport - you
have to start very young if you really
want to achieve anything

Lady Jane laughs but her eyes are still on the coach

MILLERS RENTS

is a collection of hovels built around a courtyard just off Dorset Street Its fate at
night the pubs have closed and the courtyard is crowded with men and women
The landlord - an unshaven pig of man - stands outside collecting money for an
overnight stay in a tiny room Mary and Polly accompanied by another prostitute
from The Ringers are supporting Dark Annie They shuffie towards the landlord
Mary looks in her purse -

MARY

Mary and the other prostitute - Liz Stride - look equally shocked Liz - known as
Long Liz because of her height - grew up in Sweden and speaks with an accent

Mary is about to answer but she sees three men approaching She falls silent The

INSIDE THE BASEMENT

teveal a group of policemen watching Abberline firing at a makeshift target Hes
still got his coat on - hes just arrived at work The gun is 8 jong-barreled revolver
deadly accurate and beautifully made He hands it to one of the uniformed officers -

ABBERLINE
Where did you get it Constable

CONSTABLE
We took it off an American seaman lest

probably on a freighter right now
practicing his French

He turns to the door He sees the Sergeant at his locker - hes just finished the night
shift and is getting ready to leave

Abberline joins him - together they walk out the door and along a corridor

ABBERLINE
Whats on the blotter - anything should
know

middle of the room canvasses on the walls Its mid-morning - the front door opans
and a man enters Hes in his early 30s - well-dressed sophisticated cold This is
Walter Sickert and hes a painter - in time a famous one As he takes off his hat
and coat he sees an envelope that’s been pushed under the door

He picks it up rips open the flap and starts to read the letter Though we dont see
the words his face becomes increasingly grim -

SICKERT
What the hell Mary

At last he lays it down He walks to the window and stares out thinking Then he
comes to decision

SICKERT
Anyway wash my hands of it

He tugs on a bell-pull and a moment later a manservant enters -

SICKERT

immaculate hedges An elderly man - beautifully dressed distinguished powerful -
walks down an avenue of white jonquils This is Lord Hailsham and Cliveden is his

HAILSHAM
Forty years was a soldier Sir Charles
I saw men with great skill and learning on

bravery but you know the quality came

different ways we both serve the Kingdom
We would pay any price rather than see
harm come to it wouldnt we

SIR CHARLES
Yes certainly Lord Hailsham

HAILSHAM
So it is with deep regret must tell you that
I have received a letter a very worrisome
letter It deals with matters of great
delicacy Some woman is trying to trade
information for money Somehow she has
learned things and now like a ghost out of
the past they come back But like most
ghosts the only thing to do is fay it to rest

Hailsham takes Marys letter out of his jacket pocket snd gives it to Sir Charles

tenements the sky glows red from the fire at the docks It looks like hell Polly heads
towards it She starts to sing -

POLLY
Green grow the rushes-o

She turns into -

She turns and looks in the window - the blind is drawn

NETLEY
Go on girl - open the door

She turns the handle and swings the door open All she can see is a pair of
expensive doe-skin shoes - then Gull leans forward out of the darkness and smiles
at her

GULL
Would you like grape Polly

POLLY
Ooh do love ‘em i never csn afford

She steps into the carriage

GULL

RATCLIFFE DOCKS

The fire has burned the warehouses to the bones - the brick walls stand like
skeletons amid the flames People have crowded around the docks watching the
fire-trucks and bucket brigades

The coach is parked in a quiet cul-de-sac hard up against a building The door
handle jerks as Polly tries desperately to open it Slam Her head is rammed up
against the window Her eyes are glazed she tries to scream but somehow she
doesnt seem able to manage it Gull puts his soft mouth close to her ear -

A flash of steelt Gull drives a long double-edged knife down towards her throat -

GULL
The God who punishes blackmailers
and traitors - thats the God love Polly

At the last moment Gull looks away - he cant even watch it himself Polly screams
and jerks Gull feels the blade hit flesh and bone He slumps relieved - the
anticipation is always worse than the reality He looks back - Polly is staring at him
wide-eyed terrified The blade has missed her throat and sliced into her collarbone
For a moment they just stare at one another then Gull lifts up the bloody knife and
plunges it at her throat again This time she can’t avoid it

ON TOP OF THE COACH

Netley sits in the drivers seat rocking as the coach sways with the fury of what is
happening inside Netleys too scared to even look down - he stares straight ahead
watching the fire turn the sky blood-red

BRADY STREET

Netleys coach is parked in an unlit street He and Gull stagger along beneath the
weight of something wrapped in the canvas tarpaulin They turn inte Bucks Row
narrow alley Gull stumbles and falls He picks himself up and moves on but hes
limping - hes sprained his ankle They up-end the tarpaulin Pollys body slides to
the ground Netley looks at her blood-soaked clothes -

NETLEY

Polly moans ever so slightly Shes still alive Netley revolted looks at Gull -

GULL
Dont stare at me Men have always
reserved the most extreme punishment
for crimes like hers Now lay her out
Netley Pull up her petticoats

Netley rolls her over onto her back He looks down at his hands - theyre covered in
blood He turns and walks away -

Gul opens the leather attache case Fitted inside are a range of instruments - it’s a
portable amputation kit He takes out a knife with a hooked end its called a
crooked bistoury He kneels between Pollys legs and runs his hand up the flesh of
her thighs He’s sweating - he loosens his collar He grabs hold of her underpants
and slowly pulls them down

Natiey looks at Gulls face The mans lips are moist his eyes glistening He stabs
the crooked bistoury towards Pollys stomach Netley cant watch All we hear is a
gasp from Polly

A POLICE CARRIAGE

travels fast down a dark leafy street It stops in front of a big house that has been
turned into a middle-class lodging house The Sergeant from Bishopsgate leaps out
of the carriage and hurries up the steps -

A SUITE OF ROOMS

The embers of a fire glow in the hearth - we glimpse a study a sitting room a
bedroom Theres a loud knock on the door Abberline atone in bed sits up He
picks up his watch - its almost 3am Another knock - louder more insistent
Abberline swings out of bed and goes for the door

POLLY’S BODY

lies spread-eagled in the grime of Bucks Row Her dress and petticoats are back in
place Abberline - unshaven hair still tousied from sleep - and the Sergeant make
their way through curious onlookers Doctor Leweliyn is waiting for them

DOCTOR LEWELLYN
There are two major knife wounds The
first hit her collarbone and deflected
doubt it would have killed her The
second cut her throat from ear to ear
Its so deep it damn near cut her head off

Abberline kneels beside the body Pollys skirt and bodice ere covered in blood but
none of the rest of her clothing appears out of place Abberline takes her clenched
right hand Gently he folds back the fingers - lying in her palm is a grape

residents of Bucks Row Through an open door we see into -

He sits at his desk - grim haggard Pollys blood-stained dress has been pinned to
the wall The Sergeant enters He hands Abberline a copy of a newspaper - the
mornings “Hlustrated Police News” On the front page is the photo of Abberline
kneeling over the body

SERGEANT

A SMALL GRAVEYARD

A huge crowd has gathered pushing forward trying to get a glimpse of Pollys
cheap wooden coffin It stands next to an open grave minister leading the small
group of mourners through the burial service Mary and the other three prostitutes
stand at one side Liz tries but she cant stop crying

Abberline and the Sergeant stand on a small hillock shocked at the size of the

will be turnad loose on the bear Abberline disgusted keeps walking He passes -

THE STEPS OF CHRISTCHURCH

A group of street urchins chase each other through the derelicts camped on the
steps Its an old game with a new twist - a stockily-built boy has a piece of rag tied
around his waist and a pointed stick like a knife in his hand He yells -

previously known as The Elephant Man

A half-naked man - his lower torso covered by a hospital gown - steps out of the
shadows His face is terribly deformed - a bulbous forehead flaps of gray wrinkled
skin and a thick stump of bone like a tusk protrudes from his upper jaw

Several socialites including Lady Jane stifle a cry others laugh Abberline stares at
them taken aback they should gawk and laugh so freely at someone less fortunate
He looks at Lady Jane - she’s all rapt attention fascinated by Merrick Then she
turns and smiles brightly at Abberline -

LADY JANE
Arent you glad we came

She takes his arm and leans closer against him

Waiters are serving drinks at a reception following Or Treves’ lecture Several
gristocrats write out drafts on their banks contributing to the Doctors cause

help of a cane He takes Lady Janes hand and she kisses him on the cheek -

LADY JANE
What ever have you done to yourself

GULL

LADY JANE

Mister Frederick Abberline Perhaps
youve read about Mr Abberline - hes
investigating that murder in Whitechapel

Gull looks anew at Abberline The two men shake hands

GULL

newspapers have a lot of theories -
what about the police

ABBERLINE
Information Sir William but nothing you
could dignify with the term “theory” Not
yet anyway

GULL
Yet That indicates confidence Inspector
Im reassured already How many murders
have you investigated

ASBERLINE
Thirty maybe more
GULL
And how many have you solved
ABBERLINE
All of them
GULL

murderer can long evade capture Not
unless hes extraordinarily clever of
course Tall me inspector -

LADY JANE
tf you will excuse me - should have at
least one word with the freak dont want
it getting around Im a complete coward

The men bow as Lady Jane withdraws

GULL
So tell me - confidentially - hes not just
some slash and stab merchant is he
this Whitechapel killer

ABBERLINE
Why do you say that

- GULL

The Coroners report in The Times listed
the womans injuries it didnt say explicitly
but it seems to me professionally

speaking he disemboweled her

ABBERLINE
Professionally speaking Are you a doctor
Sir Willian
GULL
Surgeon
ABBERLINE

Youre right - thats exactly what he did

GULL

A lot of peopte wouldnt appreciate how
difficult that is It takes a substantial
knowledge of anatomy - and in the dark
blood everywhere his heart probably
pounding - the closest thing could

equate it to is the work of one of those
‘ fine battlefield surgeons Of course for
all we know thats how he sees himself
aman on a battlefield of his own

and evil of course

Naturally its just speculation - who
could really know what goes through
the mind of such man Im probably
making a fool of myself For all) know
right now the police are arresting a
butcher

ABBERLINE
Not at all Were looking for a wealthy and
intelligent man He travels by carriage
and that probably means an accomplice
He can afford grapes - theyre out of
season Sir William two shillings a pound
down Spitalfields’ market and thats a lot
of money in anyones language -

GULL
Grapes Inspector What have they got
to do with it

ABBERLINE
t found one in the womans hand spent
hours trying to fathom why she didnt cry
out - surely somebody would have heard
her Then realized - he fed her grapes
But first he brushed them with laudanum
She was drugged thats why she didnt
scream

Gull stares at him impressed -
GULL
Obviously your reputation is well
deserved Mr Abberline

Before Abberline can even shrug it off Lady Jane returns flushed with her boldness
at speaking with Merrick

inspector and puts out his hand -

GULL

his eyes off of Abbertine

speaks 80 close to the ear of the bartender we cant catch what she says The
bartender indicates a table in the corner -

McQueen is holding court Several young women obviously prostitutes sit with
Geordie and the Old Nichol Street boys Mary approaches them - shes frightened
but shes damned if she’s going to show it McQueen turns and looks at her

‘McQUEEN

punters like with Annie But kill Polly

Mary looks into his eyes and knows its the truth She trembles shaken by it -

McQUEEN

woman would miss dealing with Tom
McQueen God whats the fucking

He pushes Mary aside He and Geordie head back into the pub

A SPRIG OF GRAPES

lies on the ground in a narrow passage-way just off Dorset Street From ahead we
hear voices - Dark Annie has found herself a customer She leads Gull towards a
dark and deserted yard at the back of a row of tenements

DARK ANNIE
(laughing sort of high)
Look at me staggerin will you Youd
think was drunk

GULL
We can stop here if you want

wt
wee GS Sh 4C eS CERAMICS Peete

DARK ANNIE
No Im just tired or something Everything
seems like its floating It feels nice

GULL
Excellent Annie - thats excellent

They keep walking entering -

THE YARD

Dark Annie props herself against a tall fence Gull puts down the leather briefcase
Annie turns to face him She touches his face -

DARK ANNIE
Youre a handsome man
(she laughs)
I just wish your nosed stay still thats all

GULL
Are you ready Annie

DARK ANNIE
Gettin’ all bothered are you
(she grabs his crotch)
Gawd - its hard enough isn‘t it

He strikes her hand away Gulls mask of civility drops - he grabs her by the
shoulder and spins her around But Annie drugged and disoriented laughs-

DARK ANNIE
Ooh - want it doggie-style do you

Gull slips his fingers sround her throat He starts to tighten them - she gasps and
tries to tear free but the drug seems to have sapped her strength In the first
murder Gull was nervous but now he starts to find pleasure in his work He
strangies her with one hand while the other goes to her bodice He rips open the
buttons exposing her breasts His hand slides towards them Annie fights for air -
her eyes buige Gull smiles

THE YARD NEXT DOOR
Aman comes out the back of the adjoining tenement This is Albert Cadosch a

carpenter heading out early for work He unzips his fly and starts to pee He sees
nothing - but from next door he hears a cry
vee SS FS ole CER Mes ras

DARK ANNIE No

Cadosch listens - a couple of whimpering sounds - then he decides what it is

CADOSCH
Fuckin’ whores Why dont you do your
business somewhere else

He turns and walks back inside

THE YARD

Annie fights for her life Her fingers tear at Gulls expert stranglehold but shes
growing weaker by the moment Her eyes roll back in her head and her body shakes
as she goes through the death rattle Gull lets her crumple to the ground He turns
opens the briefcase and selects a long pointed knife -

GULL
Now Ill give you some artistry Mr
Abberiine

INSIDE THE MORGUE

Its 430 am still dark outside Abberline watches as Doctor Lewellyn pulls back the
sheet from a body revealing the face Abberline turns to the Sergeant -

ABBERLINE

SERGEANT
Yeah Annie Chaprnans her name

ABBERLINE
What about the injuries - similar

DOCTOR LEWELLYN
Worse He laid open the abdomen
severed the intestines and put them
over her shoulder The uterus the
womb and its attachments were
removed including -

ABBERLINE
All right George
We 6D SD dese Teer matics fats

He turns away He rubs his eyes - hes weary drained

ABBERLINE
Jesus Where do you even stam with
a man like this

He looks at them Silence Nobody can answer

OUTSIDE THE MORGUE

reporters and sightseers ali over the place - Whitechapel’s rumor mill has been
spreading the news for the last hour The reporters surge forward as Abberline
comes out the front doors They yell questions but Abberiine grim-faced shoulders
his way through An ugly murmur rises up from the crowd - women shout abuse at
Abberline They want the police to do something - two murders in a couple of days
Abberline stares at them - he knows they’‘re frightened but still hes shocked He
gets into a waiting cab The driver cracks his whip The horses push through

INSIDE THE RINGERS

Mary Kelly has been crying Its about 9am - there’s only a few hard-core drinkers in
the pub She sits alone pale and frightened Walter Ringer puts a glass in front of
her and fills it with gin He puts out his hand for payment -

MARY
Im skint Mr Ringer Can you put it
on the slate

He goes to take the drink away - then he looks at her face

RINGER
Just this once ‘cos of Dark Annie thats
ail You pay me tomorrow you hear

She nods her head Unseen by Mary Abberline comes through the front door and
looks around He sees Mary in the corner and makes his way towards her Mary
picks up the glass but her hands trembling Before she can get it to her mouth
liquor splashes onto the tabie

MARY
to herself)
Damn - get a grip

ABBERLINE (0S)
1 knew a man with a problem like that

r

Py

Mary turns She tries to smile - she really is pleased to see him He pulls up a chair

ABBERLINE
He drank himself into an early grave
but you know what he used to do

She shakes her head - no Abberline leans close and drapes his handkerchief around
the back of her neck One end he puts in her left hand the other he wraps around
the glass of liquor He clamps her right hand around it -

ABBERLINE
Now pul down your left hand

The hangkerchief around her neck acts like a pulley The farther she pulls down with
her left hand the higher her right hand and the glass rise up It gets it to her mouth
without spilling 8 drop Despite her troubles she can’t help smiling

ABBERLINE
See works like a charm Of course the
man learned it from was an alcoholic -
thats why he couldnt hold a glass
What about you

MARY
You heard about Annie Chapman

Abberline nods Mary starts to say something but she cant - tears fill her eyes

ABBERLINE
Theres a writer called Oscar Wilde - hes
got 3 play on now One of the characters
says “to lose one parent may be a
misfortune to lose both looks like
carelessness” You could say the same
about friends Whats going on Mary

She looks at him not sure how far she can trust him Their eyes meet - Abberline’s
dont waver Shes tempted to unburden herself but then she thinks better of it -

MARY
Nothing Working girls stick together
They have to - were sort of outcasts
arent we guess a lot of girls knew
both of ‘em

He reaches into his coat and gives her three one pound notes

ABBERLINE

stay off the streets Thats a start

She stares at him for a moment unbelieving -

MARY
I can’t take this Fred

ABBERLINE
Course you can Now go on

MARY
But why are you doing this

ABBERLINE
I told you could help didnt i

Mary looks at him The money could be a life-saver - lixerally She puts her arms
around his neck and kisses him Men turn and look Abberline gently disentangles
her arms She takes hold of his hand -

MARY

He squeezes her hand turns and leaves

head down Dorset Street He sets off himself - then stops and looks back Mary has
been stopped by 8 man - shes smiling at him tucking the hair back from her
beautiful eyes Abberline can’t help it - hes angry and jealous He turns and keeps
walking not wanting to ses how the mans proposition is resolved

A SQUAT STONE BUILDING

The ground rumbles with a fast approaching roar It’s night - through a tall iron
tailing a train flashes by Abberline crosses a courtyard and enters the heavily barred
front door of the building These are the offices of the Special Branch

INSIDE THE BUILDING

A police constable sits behind a security grill Abberline stands on the other side He
opens his wallet and shows a gold crest - the badge of his rank

ABBERLINE
(mumbling)
inspector Adderly here to see Mister
Kidney

The constable barely looks at the name (Adderly and Abberline are close anyway) -
he recognizes the crest as genuine He indicates a clock on the wall -

CONSTABLE
It’s dinner time Superintendent
Kidneys not back yet sir

ABBERLINE
(smiling)
And the bastard said he had a big job
on - a big job with a knife and fork
obviously He said to wait in his office

Abberline makes a show of remembering and heads towards the stairs

THE COURTYARD

Three men head towards the stone building Ben Kidney the senior man is in his
40s Dressed in a fine gabardine coat theres an air of sophistication to him But
its his eyes that give him away - they are hard and cruel With him are Tom Press
in his 20s and a brutal-looking man called Garret Brack - also members of the
Special Branch The light from a candle flickers in a third-floor window

TOM
Somebodys working late

Kidney follows the direction of his gaze

KIDNEY
Whoever it is Im gonna take their
bails off How many times have told
‘em - you can’t use an open light in the
file room One day theyll burn the
whole shitbox down

IN THE FILE ROOM

Abberling is working fast searching through the racks of files that line the walls
Screech Abberline jumps - then he realizes it’s the whistle of a train on the tracks
right next to the building The smoke from its engine visible through two tong
windows at the back of the room throws strange shadows across the walls

THE FRONT DESK
The constable unlocks the security grill admitting Kidney and the two other men

Abberline reacts - his early warning system has been triggered

THE CORRIDOR

Kidney is in a heap on the floor tripped by a thin wire stretched across the darkened
corridor He scrambles up mouth twisted in anger

THE FILE ROOM

Abberline searches furiously He stops at a file On the top - “Crook Annie Mary”
He rips the file out of the cabinet It contains a single sheet of paper - an official

document like an admission form Printed across the top are the words

Marylebone Workhouse

THE CORRIDOR

There are two doors into the file room Kidney motions to Press and Brack - they
approach one door Kidney takes the other Simultaneously they burst in -

THE FILE ROOM

Kidneys eyes search the shadows - the intruder could be anywhere He draws a
gun Slowly he moves forward - screech Kidney jumps - then realizes its just the
train whistle

He looks at one of the tall windows - smoke from the trains locomotive spills
through a tiny crack at the top Someone hasnt closed it properly Kidney motions
to Press and Brack They close in on one window Kidney on the other

OUTSIDE THE BUILDING

Abberline dangles between the two windows his hands gripping the iron gutter
nothing supporting his feet The railway tracks are fifty feet below He watches the
shadows inside the room They move closer - smash Fists come through the glass
on either side of him He only has second to think - Kidney’s head is out the
window the gun rising his finger on the trigger Abberline looks down - train
Carriages hurtte along the tracks Kidney’s finger tightens Abberline drops Kidney
fires - misses Abberline plunges down -

THE ROOF OF THE TRAIN

He hits the roof of the carriage and tumbies - towards the edge His hand grabs an
iron conduit on the roof He lies there spread-eagied on top of the speeding train

IN THE FILE ROOM
Kidney leans out the window watching the figure of the man grow smailer

KIDNEY

The train disappears into a tunnel

These are the Coroners’ reports on the
two murders was hoping you might be
able to help in regard to the weapon

GULL
The weapon inspector

ABBERLINE
Yes If you look at the report on the first
murder it says the wounds were so
deep they were probably done with an
ax dont think thats possible - theres
fot enough room to wield an ax ina

carriage

GULL
Of course not The Coroners reports -
fascinating

He picks up the file and starts to read Abberline studies the man - the arrogant
face the soft flesh the expensive clothes He glances at Gulls doe-skin boot
resting on the stool Its obviously hand-made - pressed into the heel is the
bootmakers persona mark a three-turreted castle Gull lays the file down -

GULL
t certainly wasnt an ax ft seems from
the wounds it was a long double edged
blade One has to wonder how these
Coroners get the job

ABBERLINE
l often think that myself So in a confined
space without much force behind it the
weapon would have to be incredibly
sharp wouldnt it You were saying
before this is probably 8 man with a
substantial knowledge of anatomy -
think you mentioned a battlefield surgeon
What sort of weapon do you think a man
like that would use Sir William

GULL
Well thera‘s a number of possibilities
of course being double edged narrows
it down The word “battlefield” brings at
least one instrument to mind
dee CO FS ab ath CORRE MRED Paes

He smiles as he reaches into his drawer and pulls out the long double-bladed knife
he used to kill Polly He hands it to Abberline -

GULL

Its called a Liston knife named after

- and brilliant surgeon in the Crimean War
Because there was no anesthetic he
had to carry out amputations as
quickly as possible He designed the
knife so that he could have a leg “on
the sawdust in under a minute
Naturally cant say its the weapon but
it does fit our criteria - about ten inches
long double-edged serrated two
Narrow ridges to fold back the flesh and
drain away the blood Its a beautiful
instrument surgically speaking of
course

Abbefline turns the instrument over in his hands -

ABBERLINE
Every surgeon would have one

GULL
Yes Theyre standard issue in 8 portable
amputation kit But even if Im right im
afraid it doesnt do us much good
inspector - you can get them at any
medical supply shop Apart from that
the army must have thousands of them

Gull takes the knife back and returns it to the drawer

ABBERLINE
But its a start - a Liston knife Thank
you Sir William as always youve been
and great help

Abberline gets up shakes Gull’s hand - then stops He makes out he has just
remembered -

ABBERLINE
Oh there was one other thing Stupid
of me almost forgot - do you
femember 3 woman by the name of
Annie Crook
vee 6S

Fy 0G eG CERRD MIES Fae

He looks straight at Gull watching for his reaction Gull’s eyes flicker for moment
his hand goes to straighten his tie then he changes his mind A beat

GULL
Annie Crook-such a common name
No cant say do Why

ABBERLINE
h’s nothing really she seems to have
some small connection to one of the
women involved it turned out she was 3
patient of yours was wondering if you
knew anything about her

GULL
A patient of mine - where

ABBERLINE
Here at Guys

GULL
A lower class woman was she

ABBERLINE
Yes suppose she was

Gull smiles acting as if the mystery is solved -

GULL
Like most surgeons do a substantial
amount of pro-bono work perform
mine at Guys You could hardly call
such peopie patients - just do the
surgery on the list Naturally don’t
know anything about these people

ABBERLINE
Naturally Still hope you don’t mind me
asking Goodnight Sir William

GULL
Goodnight Inspector

He watches Abberline go For the first time despite his arrogance he feels uneasy

He looks at Lady Jane to

THE PAGES OF A BOOK

LADY JANE
What do you say he “lied” about

ABBERLINE
There was a young woman a working
class girl he operated on He said he
didnt recall her

LADY JANE
Why would he He must have had
thousands of patients can hear it in
your voice - youre not even sure
yourself are you

ABBERLINE
Of course you doubt there are always
doubts But Ive been in the force fifteen
years know what saw

LADY JANE
And why would he lie about it

ABBERLINE
t dont know Theres someone else
involved - an aristocrat He calls
himself Albert Victor - but that sounds
like two first names

see if the name means anything to her -

LADY JANE
Dont took at me - Im sure dont
know

ABBERLINE

Theres a book isnt there - it lists
knignts and lords

LADY JANE
Earls viscounts marquis and dukes

He is searching the pages of a huge book The door opens -

LADY JANE

ABBERLINE

He leans back in the chair and rubs his eyes Hes so tired he can barely see

LADY JANE
Have you thought - maybe Albert
Victors a completely invented name

ABBERLINE
Yes have but its what the woman
who loved him used Its all Ive got

LADY JANE
What - and she didn’t remember
anything else

ABBERLINE
Just that she had a daughter She went
down the rabbit hole and the wicked old
queen said “off with her head”

LADY JANE
“Alice in Wonderland” - thats helpful

But Abberiine barely hears her - he’s following a thought

ABBERLINE
She remembered her daughters name
wonder why couldn’t her mind hold
onto something else

Lady Jane looks at him lost She shrugs

LADY JANE
Im sorry Fred - its too late for
children’s stories Im going to bed

ABBERLINE

The street at the front of Bishopsgate Police station is coming to life A cab draws
up and Abberline looking exhausted gets out He goes up the front steps and into
the station A constable behind the desk looks up

CONSTABLE

The Sergeant and several other cops watch as Abberline reads aloud parts of a
handwritten letter

ABBERLINE
“1 am down on whores and shant quit

PALACE ROAD

runs from the gates of Buckingham Palace to the Houses of Parliament The street is
lined with sightseers Uniformed police keep them back as ranks of ceremonial
troops pass by - the Household Cavalry the Life Guard the tmperial Dragoons

A cheer goes up for the Queens gold-encrusted State coach The dour old woman
dressed in her perpetual black sits alone waving at her subjects Following close
behind are dozens of other coaches carrying members of the Royal Family and the
countrys lesding noblemen

In the second rank is a magnificent vehicle trimmed in gold Driving it - ramrod
straight and dressed in finery - is a man we recognize John Netley

IN THE CROWD

Abberline and Mary push through to the front The coaches are approaching the
gates to the Houses of Parliament Abberline points out Netley’s coach (they cant
see the drivers face because the footmen and postillions block him from view)

ABBERLINE
The second coach Look at the man
inside look at his face understand

Mary neds her head - yes She steps out onto the road The coach draws abreast of
them Inside a man sits alone Its Albert Victor He turns -

Mary looks through the window The man starts to wave at what he thinks is an
enthusiastic subject Then he stops - he and the woman have seen each other
before a year ago in a basement apartment Mary stares at him He looks back
Then the coach is gone passing through the gates and into the forecourt of the
Houses of Parliament

ABBERLINE
Was it him Mary

MARY

Who is he

Abberline feels his stomach turn as the truth is confirmed

ABBERLINE
Albert Victor Prince Edward Albert
Victor Christian Grandson of Her
Majesty the Queen Heir to the throne

Mary stares at him - God what has she brought down on herself All around them
the crowd is dispersing Abberline speaks softly -

ABBERLINE
I cant see all the threads Mary - not
half of them shouldnt think - but the
Special Branch ere involved sos the
Queens surgeon and the Prince

He looks at her hoping shell volunteer something but she doesn’t

hand clamps across her mouth He slashes the knife down from her breasts to her
knees cutting apart her dress and petticoats laying bare her stomach and crotch

“The Juwes are not the men who
will be blamed for this for nothing”

Lying underneath it is a piece of blood-soaked apron and not far sway the slashed
and gutted body of Kate Eddowes Police are milling about everywhere Abberline
and the Commissioner himself Sir Charlies Warren look at the graffiti -
ABBERLINE
Of course it could have been on the
wall before the murder - theyre mostly
Jewish people living in this building

SIR CHARLES
Wash it off

Abberline looks at him unbelieving -

ABBERLINE
Sir Charles - it may be evidence it
should be photographed

SIR CHARLES
Thats not a mis-spelling of Jews Its
got nothing to do with synagogues Its
8 word only a Mason would use Like
everything to do with the Freemasons
its meaning is secret

ABBERLINE
Thats even more reason we should
keep it

SIR CHARLES
No Its probably someone trying to discredit
the Masons A lot of powerful men are
members of the society dont need them
asking why that was allowed to happen
Come to that we dont need every rabbi in
London asking the same thing

The two men look at each other - Abberline obviously doesnt agree

Grim-faced Abberline nods his head in agreement He turns and walks away Sir

SIR CHARLES
its my responsibility Fred

Charles watches him go Theres a sadness in the Commissioners eyes - he knows
just how compromised he is

KATE’S BODY

is lifted onto a stretcher and carried to the back of an ambulance A constable has
almost finished scrubbing the graffiti from the wall Abberline moves slowly almost
alone near where her body lay On the ground are a couple of buttons

He bends to look at them - probably torn from Kate as the killer ripped her bodice
off He starts to stand - then he sees one of the cobblestones is missing A thin film
of blood has flowed into it covering the mud Pressed into it is the perfect imprint
of a man’s heel

Abberline pulls out a white handkerchief and presses it into the hole Carefully he
lifts it out Traced in blood is an impression of the heel print In its center is the
bootmakers mark - a three-turreted castle

ABBERLINE
Gull

We hold on him - totally alone staring at the truth The wind starts to rise moaning
and sighing through the tenements It carries over to -

THE SIGN

out the front of Mrs Finnanes boarding house Its the early hours of the same
morning the house in darkness nothing stirring We crane up to a window -
INSIDE A BEDROOM

Mary is asleep The few possessions she has are scattered around the room - a
couple of dresses hanging from hooks on the wall 8 photograph of a family
standing in front of a broken-down Irish cottage a small glass perfume jar

A LONG AND LONELY ROAD

The death carriage travels fast foam flying from the horses’ mouths Netley cracks
the whip - heading for the boarding house Inside Gull looks at his watch Its
350am

THE REAR OF MARYS BOARDING HOUSE

Gull carrying the leather case mounts a flight of exterior steps He opens a door
and steps into a -

CORRIDOR

A candle in a glass bracket casts a shifting faltering light Silently Gull makes his

way past the numbered doors He stops in front of number 14 and tries the handle
Locked

INSIDE MARYS ROOM

The point of the Liston knife slides between the edge of the door and the frame It
flicks up the latch Without a sound the door opens Gull slides in and closes it
behind him Click He locks it He puts the bag down on the floor and crosses to the
bed in the darkness its a jumble of blankets and pillows He takes hold of the bed
clothes and draws them back The bed is empty

A rustle of movement behind him He spins raising an arm to fend off the blow
Theres nothing there - just the wind through a crack in the window hitting the
dress hanging on the wall Gull looks around - the room is empty

A NARROW LANEWAY

The death coach is parked in the shadows Netley is in his seat Theres blood on
his overcoat a smear of it across his face - he looks shattered He glances up at the
second floor of the boarding house Through the window of room 14 he sees a
candie moving back and forth Whats Gull doing Is it over - that fast

INSIDE MARYS ROOM

Gull lifts up Marys underwear and holds it to his face catching the smell of her
body He casts it aside and picks up the photograph - a dirt poor Irish family
Theres five children - all boys except for a beautiful girl aged about twelve Its
unmistakably Mary Gull puts it down and takes up the perfume bottle Its called
“Wild Roses” He takes out the stopper - and curls his nose in disgust

Crash Something metallic hits the ground deep within the house Gull turns
listening -

IN THE KITCHEN

Mary is at work She curses as she picks up a large cauldron of water shes
dropped It’s four in the morning and shes alone getting the kitchen ready for the
day It’s a sequence of inter-connected rooms - food pantry scullery china room
bread ovens A fire roars in the hearth Mary picks up the cauldron end puts it on
the gfate to boil

THE DOOR
into the scullery opens and Gull - his frock-coat buttoned carrying his leather bag -

enters He listens Nothing He walks between the wooden benches passes the
pantry and enters the heart of the kitchen

Its hard to see - pots and pans heng from racks a series of benches and half-walls
shadows playing from the firelight From a nook near the fireplace the sound of
movement Gull silently unclips the leather bag - he has the Liston knife close at
hand He walks forward

NEXT TO THE BREAD OVENS

Three cats circle a rat theyve trapped One of the cats pounces grabs the rat by
the neck and shakes it A second cat turns - Gull is standing looking at them This

was the noise he heard The adrenaline runs out of him He relaxes A voice behind
him -

MARY (0S)
What are you doing

Gull startled spins - Mary’s come in from the courtyard She holds two buckets
shes filled from the water pump She looks at Gull’s distinguished face takes in his
frock-coat and the leather bag - and smiles

MARY
Im sorry Doctor - didnt mean to
startle you

Gulls seen her before or version of her - in the photograph He drinks her in with
his eyes - the lustrous hair the fine features the soft swell of her breasts The
others were nothing compared to this

GULL
What a lovely scent youre wearing
It smells like wild roses

MARY
Thats exactly what it is Can i help
you

GULL

Yes Ive been looking for someone
Would you care for a grape

Out of his pocket he takes a bag of grapes He walks up to her offering the grapes
Mary reaches out and takes one Gull is now within striking distance Mary lifts the
grape to her mouth

Gulls hand hidden from her is coming up - he’s going to grab her throat and close
off the cerotid artery Not to kill her but enough to make her helpless He wants to
enjoy this His lips are dry he runs his tongue along them Mary doesnt notice -
shes looking past him

Gull is caught between the two women He barely misses a beat -

He picks up his bag looks once more at Mary and goes Mary catches the look -
there’s something about it as if someone just walked across her grave

THE FIRST LIGHT OF DAY

streams through a window and into the kitchen The place is bustling - cooks and
maids are getting breakfast ready for the lodgers

Mary looks up from scrubbing down a bench - she sees Abberline standing in the
doorway He has come straight from the crime scene One look at his face and she
knows something terrible has happened She goes to him

Mary feels her knees weaken - she leans on a bench She tries to be strong but
tears fill her eyes Abberline takes her arm and guides her out of the kitchen into -

THE DESERTED DINING ROOM

Mary sits down at one of the long tables Abberline takes the page from The Star”
out of his pocket - the one that shows the women at Pollys funeral He lays it
down in front of her

ABBERLINE
There were five of you and now theres

Marys face is turned away but she shudders - shes starting to sob

ABBERLINE
(gently)
Do you want to tell me now

Silence A baat Then she looks up

MARY
Youre right there were the five of us
but it was my idea so have to take
the blame

She stops to collect herself trying not to cry She goes on -

MARY

Albert Victors relationship with Annie

he got he was at the house You only

her third in line to the throne Jesus But

MARY
Thats the point Fred - she wasnt
illegitimate Over a year ago before
she was pregnant Annie Crook and
Albert Victor went to a tiny church in
Sussex The only witnesses were
two farm workers On an afternoon
late in July they were married

ABBERLINE

This is the Kingdom youre talking
about Mary A thousand ysars of
power No wonder theyre killing
People She would have been Queen
As monarch Albert Victor becomes
head of the Church of England - the
marriage couldnt be dissolved

(he pauses)
You said you were desperate

MARY

was that somebody was willing to go
to a lot of trouble to keep it quiet got
to thinking they might pay us to do the
same So wrote a letter -

She looks even deeper into his eyes He leans forward and kisses her She kisses
him back - not matter what else happens she’s thankful shes found this She puts

watches them He tosses his grooming brush to another kid pulls on his jacket and
sets off in pursuit

kit He plunges the instrument down It slices through the pillow and into her face
She screams - a scream of prima pain Not even the pillow can muffie it entirely
The cry carries over -

A CAT

in an upstairs room catches the sound It jumps from a table onto a bed waking an
elderly woman She sits up - another cry or was it Again she listens - nothing

MARYS ROOM

Shes still alive - a rasping breathing comes from beneath the blood-soaked piliow
Gull turns to the amputation kit and selects his favorite - the Liston knife He pulls
aside the tengle of blankets - her body is completely unmarked Not for long - he
makes two ritualistic cuts across her breasts She jerks from the pain but theres no
strength to it Gull holds her down with one hand on the pillow

He looks at the naked bleeding body - hes sweating his breathing fast and
shallow
ew tee be mee

He positions himself between her legs and raises the knife above her stomach He
slides it through her flash and lays open the abdominal cavity Blood sprays Theres
a reflex spasm then she lies still Completely still

ABBERLINE

is in the back of the fast-traveling cab In his hand are the tickets to Ireland

MARYS ROOM

Gull has banked the fire into a roaring blaze - the iron kettle hanging sbove it is
starting to melt The walls around the bed are covered in blood We barely glimpse
the body but we see that it is terribly mutilated - at least one arm has been severed
and what is left of the face is a mask of blood

Gull walks to the fire with his instruments He pushes the Liston knife and the
crooked bistoury into the flames purifying them The heat threatens to scorch him
but he is so euphoric he barely notices

THE DEATH COACH

is almost obscured in the fog and rain Netley sees Gull approaching - he looks
exhausted but his eyes are shining bright He seems to stagger as he opens the
coach door

NETLEY
Are you ail right sir

GULL
Perfectly have come through the fire
I have stood in the Sea of Tranquillity
and seen the five rings of Saturn He
is risen” thats what the good book
says isnt it “He is risen

As he gets in he turns and looks once more at Netley His voice is gentile -

GULL
saved the best for last Our great
work is finished Youve done your
duty Go home Netley

Netley straightens himself up and snaps the reins The coach heads into the
darkness

A CORRIDOR

in the boarding house The elderly woman from upstairs holding a lantern comes
down the stairs She heads towards the open door of a bathroom then stops She
lowers the lantern - a bloody footprint on the floor Then another - she follows them
to Marys door It stands ajar She pushes it open and looks into the room She
screams

THE CAB

turns into the strest in front of Gardeners Court Abberline sees police an
ambulance and a throng of people gathered outside the boarding house

ABBERLINE
No

He hurls the door open scrambles out and runs -

THE CORRIOOR

outside Marys room is packed The local police try to bring some sort of order
Abberline pushes through to a bluff-faced cop

ABBERLINE
(anguished)
Where is she

The cop inclines his head indicating the room Abberline looks inside - the blood
splattered walls the crumpled form covered by a bloody sheet The world reels

cop
Theres a bag by the wash-stand Its got
a few things in it - a woman by the name
of Mary Kelly

But Abberline barely hears He steps inside the room The cop disinterested turns
away Abberline looks - the dress Mary was wearing the last time he saw her is
hanging in the closet On the table is the photograph of her family in Ireland He
reaches down and picks up a silk ribbon a woman uses to tie her bonnet He runs
the fabric - her fabric through his fingers

Slowly he goes to the bed As hard as it is he has to look at her He takes hold of
the sheet and draws it back His eyes go to her face But it’s not really a face any
more - just 3 mutilated and bloody mess We push in on him - the anguish and fury
overwhelm him Hes going to kill Gull Conspiracy or not he’s going to kill him

BROOK STREET

The houses in the street are in darkness - all except for number 74 Gas lights
illuminate the entrance to Gull’s home A cab pults up in front

IN THE ENTRY HALL

A butler - dressed but obviously roused from bed - crosses the marble foyer and
opens the front door Abberline stands on the threshold The butler looks the
disheveled figure up and down but before he can say anything Gull - freshly bathed
and scented - appears at the top of the stairs He and Abberline look at each other
Gull comes forward calm and pleasant -

GULL
can only assume its official business
that brings you out at such an hour
Whats happened Inspector

ABBERLINE
No not official - personal

Gul cant miss the anger in Abberlines voice but hes completely composed He
smiles -

GULL
Then only hope can be of help Do
you mind the study Inspector Given
the hour think we can allow ourselves
a little informality don’t you

Abberline is so wound up he barely makes sense of what Gull is saying Gull ushers
him into -

THE STUDY
A fire still burns in the hearth Gull takes a taper and starts to light the lamps

GULL
if you can tell me Inspector -

ABBERLINE
(interrupting)
You left something behind in Mitre Square

For a fraction of a second it makes Gull pause but then he covers it continuing his
task

GULL
Thats strange - dont recall ever being
in Mitre Square

---ABBERLINE
Its where Kate Eddowes was murdered

GULL
Kate Eddowes Really

Abberline says nothing At last Gull turns and looks at him - Abberline is holding out
the white handkerchief Gull stares at the bloody heel-print of the three-turreted
castle A beat - then he laughs

Abberline says nothing

It stops Gull in his tracks

GULL
Who would have thought it - the
vanity of hand-made shoes A poorer
tan might have passed completely
unnoticed Its hard not to appreciate
the irony of it isnt it

GULL
So is that why youre here inspector -
to arrest mo Because if you are
think should explain a number of
things to you It could save you
substantial embarrassment -

ABBEALINE
I know about Prince Edward

GULL
So - the question about Annie Crook
wasnt just an idle inquiry then should
have realized Weil stand corrected
Inspector - your reputation may be
deserved after all As you know about
the Prince theres no need for me to
say anymore is there You must
understand perfectly the favor and
protection in which Her Majesty holds
me

tee
ABBERLINE
Perfectly Sir William But Im not here
to arrest you

He draws the revolver out from under his jacket

GULL
Now understand - its justice you want

ABBERLINE
I wasnt sure you even knew the word

GULL
Oh know it But Im afraid youre bound
to be disappointed You wont find justice
at least not here Inspector

ABBERLINE
There you go again - another under-
estimation What do you call an
execution

He raises the gun and points it straight at Gull

GULL
And theyll hang you for it Theyll say
you murdered an innocent man ls
that the justice youre looking for
Five women dead and the man who
knows the truth strung up at Newgate
Will that restore your faith

ABBERLINE
S doubt it - but itll do for now

From outside very faint the sound of a carriage stopping Neither Abberline or Gull
pay it any mind Abberline cocks the hammer The doctor stares straight down the

barrel

GULL
did my duty thats all 1 was a loyal
servant of the Crown If its justice
youre looking for what about them
Shouldnt they be brought to account
But they wont be wil they It’s only
you that will be punished But go ahead
throw your life away In the end it
wont change a thing

ABBERLINE
Good night doctor Ill bs looking at your
face want to see the bullet hit

His finger starts to squeeze the trigger He looks along the barrel straight at Gulls
eyes Behind the doctor a flicker of movement For a moment Abberline racks
focus - he is looking through a set of french doors Someone is hurrying up the front
steps - its a woman She turns and looks into the study It’s Mary

GULL
What is it Inspector Lost your nerve

Mary walks up to the french doors Abberlines hand on the gun starts to shake

GULL
You cant do it can you Deep inside
you believe in the law -

Abberline wrenches his eyes away from mary he looks at Gull as if seeing him for
the first time Abberlines fist smashes out The butt of the pistol crashes into Gulls
fleshy cheek Crunch The sound of breaking bone and teeth Gull crumples
unconscious

Abberline goes to the doors and unlatches them Mary takes 8 step towards him and
he opens up his arms Shes real - he’s holding her They kiss - but only for a
moment Abberlines mind is racing He bustles her out along the front terrace

ABBERLINE
I don’t know what happened but he
thinks he murdered you Youre dead
Mary And in killing you hes given you
back your life Youre free Mary

MARY
But wont somebody identify -

ABBERLINE
Ive seen the body Believe me - they
cant
Mary shudders The cab Mary came in waits at the curb They hurry towards it
Abberline gives directions to the driver but we dont hear what they are

INSIDE THE CAB

Abbarline climbs in and slams the door shut The driver snaps the reins - the cab
takes off Abberiine turns and looks at her -

ABBERLINE
How Mary how

MARY

supper By the time came back my
pocket had been picked told the
landlady d lost my money - but she
wouldnt let me keep the room if

He pulls one of the steamer tickets and a bunch of banknotes out of his pocket He
thrusts them into her hand

ABBERLINE

Not like that should have thought of it
before Im going to kill him with my

The cab stops in front of the huge Victoria railway station Abberline looks up at the
station clock - its five minutes before the hour

ABBERLINE
Hurry

She tooks at him -

MARY
Promise me Fred

ABBERLINE
I promise

She reaches out her arms and kisses him And then again She gets out of the cab
and walks towards the station He watches her go

ABBERLINE’S OFFICE

dawn is poking through the window Abberline sits at his desk several files in front
of him On top of one we see the title

The Whitechapel Murders
aka
Jack the Ripper

A knock at the door A young constable puts his head in

CONSTABLE
Theres a gentleman here to see you
sir He says he has an appointment but
he wont give his name

Abberline gets to his feet The door swings open Ben Kidney of the Special Branch
walks in Abberline puts out his hand -

ABBERLINE
Mr Kidney It was good of you to
come
KIDNEY

1 hope its worth it Inspector don’t like
being woken for nothing

Abberline closes and bolts the door Kidney notes it - hardly anything escapes his
attention - but says nothing

ABBERLINE
(think youll find it worthwhile It
concerns the Whitechapel murders
As you may know their investigation
has been my responsibility

KIONEY
Im aware of that

Abberline sits down behind his desk He pauses as if weighing the burden of what
he is about to say He speaks quietly -
Even Kidney as inscrutable as he is sits forward His cold eyes stare straight at

Abberline

ABBERLINE
During the course of my inquiries
have come across a name Its an
alias Mr Kidney - dont know who the
person is - but he calls himself Albert
Vieror

KIDNEY
Where did you hear this name

ABBERLINE
From Sir William Gull Which is why
I called you - my inquiries indicate that
on at least two occasions he has told
people that the murders are somehow
connected to a person of great rank
thought you should know of this

KIDNEY
Did Sir William elaborate

ABBERLINE
No But to be honest havent pursued
it Im a loyal officer Mr Kidney - Im sure
there are some areas areas no
investigation should blunder into If there
is any truth to what Sir William says
thought the thing to do was to put it in the
hands of those best equipped to deal with it

KIDNEY
That was exactly the right thing And youre
sure he said nothing else

ABBERLINE
Not that know of

KIDNEY
Vil take care of this Well have a talk to
Sir William

He gets to his feet and shakes hands with Abberline

I dont think so Mr Kidney im afriad
decided some time ago to seek
opportunities elsewhere

KIDNEY
Thats a shame

He walks to the door he’s about to open it - then stops He turns back -

KIDNEY
m sorry - didnt ask you What made
you come to me

ABBERLINE
That was the easy part spoke to 3
friend asked him - “Who will help the
widows son”

Kidney smiles warmly

KIDNEY
Good day Inspector

ABBERLINE
Good day Superintendent

BROOK STREET

Its the morning of the same day Gull leads Lord Hailsham and Kidney across the
foyer and into his study He closes the door and speaks to Hailsham -

GULL
1 was going to call on you this morning
- weve got a problem

KIDNEY
We certainly do

Before Gull can say anything theres a noise behind him He turns - Tom Press
Garret Brack and several other members of the Special Branch come through the
doors A look of confusion panic crosses Gull’s face He spins back to Hailsham -
Kidney is waiting for him He grabs Gull’s arm and drives it up behind his back - the
doctor cries out in pain Tom Press has the handcuffs on before Gull even realizes

A middle-aged man stands nervously in front of Queen Victoria

VICTORIA
As a surgeon Sir Richard are we right
in saying that the removal of the thyroid
gland can have devastating effects on
memory

SIR RICHARD
Thats quite right Your Majesty

VICTORIA
And there are medical conditions which
would lead a doctor to perform such an
operation

SIR RICHARD
Most certainly ma’em

VICTORIA
Even under unusual circumstences a
doctor could find ethical reasons for
undertaking such an operation - am
I right Sir Richard

SIR RICHARD
There can be no higher ethical reason
than the opportunity to serve Queen and
country ma’am

Victoria inclines her head and smiles acknowledging his loyalty
