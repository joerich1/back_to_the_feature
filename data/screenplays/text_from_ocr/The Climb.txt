almost hitting Mike

MIKE (CONT’D)
Hey HEY

Mike gets out of his saddle and takes off pedaling hard

KYLE MIKE (CONTD)
What are you doing Hey asshole

Mike races down the road after the car

The CAMERA stays with Kyle who rides at a slower pace down
the road still out of breath and processing the information
As Kyle comes around a bend in the road his eyes fix on
something happening in the distance

He approaches and the sound of two men screaming gets louder
Kyle slows his bike to a stop

The yelling turns to grunting

The CAMERA swings behind Kyle to reveal Mike being thrown to
the ground by the DRIVER of a car that is now pulled over on
the shoulder of the road

Kyle does nothing

The driver pushes Mikes face in the dirt

DRIVER DRIVER (TRANSLATION)
Espece de Pignouf You hooligan

Mike flails trying to break free
The driver punches him in the ribs

Mike gets a hold of the drivers leg and pulls him to the
ground

They wrestle

The CAMERA continues moving up the road passing the window
of the car where a LITTLE BOY with blonde hair sits in the
passenger seat

The little boy gets out of the car

BOY (0S)
Papa

The driver gets the upper hand
He looks up to see the little boy standing outside the car

BOY (CONTD) BOY (TRANSLATION) (CONTD)
Ca va Are you okay

The drivers voice becomes soft and paternal

DRIVER DRIVER (TRANSLATION)
Oui mon poussin Rentre dans Yes my chickadee Get back in

longtemps

The little boy gets back in the car and closes the door

The CAMERA continues moving slowly down the road as Mike
struggles beneath the man

The driver stands letting go of Mike He turns and walks
back to his car

He gets in and takes off down the road passing the CAMERA

Mike rolls on the ground groaning in pain Kyle stands
beside him watching

Kyle walks to the edge of the road and stares down He
carefully walks down the embankment

Mike sits up
Kyle climbs back onto the road carrying Mikes bidon

KYLE

INTERLUDE

EXT CEMETERY - DAY 4

Mens voices sing the Ricky Van Shelton version of the hymnal
I SHALL NOT BE MOVED sung a capella

The CAMERA looks at the sky and trees moving through a
lightly wooded area The CAMERA still moving drops to
reveal its a cemetery

The CAMERA stops a tractor scoop bucket drops down into the
frame The CAMERA moves down with the bucket as it tears into
the ground digging a grave

A CEMETERY WORKER continues to sing I shall not be moved
near a dug grave The CAMERA moves around the dug grave to
reveal five more WORKERS singing while resting and eating
They are all wearing GREEN JUMPSUITS that read Eternal
Hills Cemetery

END OF INTERLUDE

EXT CEMETERY - FUNERAL - DAY 5
A PRIEST speaks in front of a group of mourners

PRIEST
For the Lord himself will descend
from heaven with a cry of command
with the voice of an archangel and
with the sound of the trumpet of
God

BEEP BEEP BEEP

A LOUD BEEPING NOISE of a tractor in reverse can be heard in
the distance He pauses to let it pass

The beeping stops

PRIEST (CONTD)
And the dead in Christ will rise
first

It starts again BEEP BEEP BEEP

The CAMERA leaves the priest and wanders past the mourners
toward a tractor moving in reverse in the distance

The tractor stops

The CAMERA turns to find a man in the distance walking
toward camera As he gets closer we see it is Kyle He wears
a suit

PRIEST (0S) (CONT’D)
Then we who are alive who are
left will be caught up together
with them in the clouds

As Kyle gets closer the CAMERA begins leading him back in
the direction of the funeral

PRIEST (0S) (CONTD)
To meet the Lord in the air and so
we will always be with the Lord
Therefore encourage one another
with these words Amen

GROUP (0S)
Amen

Kyle enters the crowd of mourners

He walks past a girl who notices him and nods As he passes
she whispers to the guy next to her

PRIEST
And now her husband Michael would
like to say a few words

Kyle watches on His face is stern emotionless

MIKE (0C)
Thank you all for coming Thank you
father for the beautiful words
Its strange hearing them because I
know that she didnt really believe
in heaven

The CAMERA turns to reveal Mike is giving the eulogy

MIKE (CONTD)
She was more into the idea of
reincarnation but this all happened
so fast and I didnt even know
where to begin finding a priest who
would talk about reincarnation So
I just went with the basic package
that they sold me at the funeral
home

He gets choked up

MIKE (CONT’D)
But thank you father for being
here Im sorry Ava

He stares at the coffin Beside the grave is a framed picture
of Ava

MIKE (CONTD)
I think I fucked this up Can we
just get it over with

Mike grabs a shovel and lifts some dirt Hes about to throw
it on the grave when a CEMETERY WORKER in a green jumpsuit
reaches out and grabs the shovel

CEMETERY WORKER
Sorry you cant do that Its a
Union cemetery

MIKE
Im burying my wife

CEMETERY WORKER
I understand but if youre not
Local 365 you cant touch the
equipment

MIKE
Its a fucking shovel
ANOTHER CEMETERY WORKER steps closer

Mike tries to pull the shovel away from the man but he
doesnt let go Instead he rips it from Mikes hands

MIKE (CONT’D)
Fuck you

The priest calls out to Mike

PRIEST
Michael Its okay

MIKE
Okay Sorry father

Mike turns away then quickly lunges for the shovel ripping
it from the workers hands

The worker goes after the shovel but Mike swings it keeping
him at a distance

MIKE (CONTD)

Back up Stay back Im gonna throw
some dirt on this grave and then
Im gonna go home

CEMETERY WORKER
Put the shovel down

MIKE
NO

Mike swings the shovel wildly to keep the cemetery worker
back He accidentally hits the large glass framed picture of
Ava It shatters and goes crashing to the ground

MIKE (CONT’D)
Oh no Ava

Mike turns around and the two cemetery workers grab and
wrestle him to the ground

The CAMERA turns back to Kyle who watches on The crowd does
nothing

Kyle rushes toward the fight

KYLE
Hey

Kyle pulls one of the men off of Mike

He grabs Mike by the hands and pulls him away from the other
man dragging Mike across the cemetery lawn to a safe
distance

The CAMERA follows them Kyle lets go Mike rolls onto his
stomach and lies face down on the grass Kyle watches on

KYLE (CONTD)
Hey Its okay Come on

Kyle reaches down and lifts Mike up by the chest from behind

Mike stands Kyle lets go and he immediately falls back to
the ground

KYLE (CONTD)
Okay come on Lets get up

from behind

person who gets it How special she
was How amazing but also
frustrating she could be You know

point we had six dogs living with
us And one of them really didnt
like me Id wake up in the middle
of the night to go to the bathroom
and Gus would just growl at me I
mean these arent like normal
rescues these are like street
dogs But thats the thing we
built this life together and it
wasnt perfect but it was ours And
it worked She was patient and
loving Everyone talks about how
when you get married the sex gets
worse but it just got better
like so much better

The CAMERA comes around to reveal they are within earshot of
the funeral crowd who are listening

KYLE
Hey lets just come here

Kyle leads him away from the crowd out of earshot

MIKE
Sorry

KYLE MIKE (CONTD)

Kyle walks away

Mike is left standing alone
Kyle steps back in front of Mike

Mike stands holding the shovel The CAMERA stays with him
A tractor roars to life in the background

CEMETERY WORKER (0S)
Hey Get off that tractor

KYLE (0S)
Make me

The cemetery workers run toward the tractor They pass Mike
Mike walks back to the grave site

BEEP BEEP BEEP The sound of the tractor echoes across the
cemetery mixed with the sound of men yelling at Kyle

Mike jams the shovel into the ground and pours dirt onto the
grave

He digs it into the ground again

INTERLUDE

INT SPIN CLASS - DAY 6

Then we see Kyle He does not move to the rhythm Sweat pours
from his face and he looks like he might pass out at any
moment

Kyle flicks his hand up to wipe the sweat pouring from his
forehead His sweat whips into the face of the woman riding

I hit puberty super late plus my
birthday was in March so I was
young for our grade Also I think
John Rizzi was doing Taekwondo
because he knew how to block and
stuff And I remember laying there
at the edge of the woods after the
bell had rung and I could taste the
blood from my nose And I remember
Kyle standing there

(MORE )

MIKE (0S) (CONTD)

He was taller than everyone and he
helped me up and we walked inside
together And after that when Rizzi
or anyone else messed with me Kyle
would just stand near me and theyd
leave me alone And thats how we
became best friends

MARISSA
Wow
MIKE
Hes the best person there ever
was

and second pews It moves toward grandma who is still
singing It then moves across the faces of Kyles family
members as they watch

The MUSIC comes to an end and a PRIEST begins speaking

reads holy vows
