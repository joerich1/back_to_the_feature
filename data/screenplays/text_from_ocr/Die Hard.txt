An Emory freight truck turns off Olympic into the underground
parking garage of Nakatomi

INT PARKING GARAGE

It goes down the ramp and passes Argyles black limo The
drivers seat is EMPTY

INT LIMO - SAME

Argyle sits in the back seat hidden from the outside world by
the tinted rear windows He is making a drink from the bar
with the TV on and his rap music blasting from the cassette
player oblivious to the truck passing behind him

INT PARKING GARAGE - SAME

The Emory truck stops in front of the service elevator on the

next level down As the truck idles the uniformed driver
makes a note on his clipboard

unclenching his toes

MCCLANE

tension decline)
Son-of-a-bitch It works

Holly sits on the desk here watches him remove his jacket tie
shirt etc Begin to wash up in the private bath

HOLLY
What are you doing

MCCLANE
Its a long story You know I
think that Ellis has his eye on you

HOLLY
Thats okay
(pause)
I have an eye on his private
bathroom

McClanes face shows his relief (or rather his attempt not
to show any)

HOLLY
So where are you staying This
all happened so fast I didnt even
ask you on the phone

McClane finishes drying his face and steps to the bath doorway

MCCLANE
Well Cappy Roberts retired out
here a couple years ago He said I
could bunk with him

HOLLY
OhWhere does he live

MCCLANE
Ramonano Pomona thats it

HOLLY

not huge but the kids would love to
have you at the house

McClane fixes her with a look
MCCLANE
They would huh

HOLLY
(beat honest)
I would too

They lock eyes for a moment but its an intense moment that
says a lot about how they still feel about each other

Just then a man and a woman both a little tipsy open the
door to the office see that its occupied and beat a hasty
retreat The interruption temporarily dents the mood Holly
tries to smile But for McClane its the last frustration

HOLLY
Ive missed you

MCCLANE
Especially my name You must miss
it every time you write a check When
did you start calling yourself
Ms Gennero

HOLLY
(caught)
This is a Japanese company you know
They figure a married woman shes on
the way out the door

MCCLANE
Sure Its unnerving I remember
this one particular married woman
she went out the door so fast there
was practically a jetwashI mean
talk about your wind chill factor

HOLLY
Didnt we have this same conversation
in July Damn it John there was

an opportunity out here -- I had to

take it --
MCCLANE

No matter what it did to our marriage --
HOLLY

My job and my title and my salary did
nothing to our marriage except change
your idea of what it should be

MCCLANE
Oh here it comes One of those
meaningful relationship conversations
I never shouldve let you get those
magazine subscriptions --

HOLLY

You want to know my idea of a marriage
Its a partnership where people help
each other over the rough spots --

downand when theres an up well
hell a little Goddamn applause or
an attaboy wouldnt be too bad
(quietly)
I needed that John

McClane stands silhouetted against the window In the distance
he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto

Avenue of the Stars

Suddenly the red light on the first truck goes out then on the

second McClane watches in disbelief The trucks slow and
turn down separate side streets heading for home

MCCLANE
(realizing)
Son of a bitch

Just then the elevator bell rings and we HEAR the ELEVATOR DOORS
OPEN A figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his machine

gun drawn We MOVE WITH HIM FROM the elevator area until he
reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire
floor McClane is gone

ON MCCLANE

under a desk He takes in his options

HIS POV

The feet of Tony They move slowly in his direction McClane
Looks down the aisle next to the windows It leads to a series
of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path
if he can make it past Tony

TONY
He moves steadily toward the area where we saw McClane

TONY

The fire has been called off my
friend No one is coming to help
you You might as well come out
and join the others

(fingers the trigger

of his machine gun)
I promise not to hurt you

Moving more confidently he steps up to McClanes desk then
around it and fires a blast into the space It is empty As
the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another
SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near

the cubicles

Tony heads toward the noise Sensing a trap he moves past
each cubicle carefully checking each office until he reaches
the doorway of the last one The sound is just around the
partition He tenses then spins into the cubicle

TONYS POV

A radial arm saw spins noisily
TONY

grins at his nervousness He moves to turn it off not
realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane

steps INTO FRAME behind him McClane shoves his pistol barrel
against Tonys temple

MCCLANE

Tony doesnt McClane cocks his Beretta Tony watches him
calmly

TONY
You wont hurt me

MCCLANE
Yeah Why not

TONY

Because you are a policeman There
are rules for policemen

MCCLANE
Yeah My Captain keeps telling
me the same thing

McClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head Tony
REELS then swallows worried for the first time

MCCLANE
Lets go

Suddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES but the
big mans momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends
his pistol into the hall

Tony fires his machine gun but McClane kicks him into the desk

He locks his arms around the big mans neck in a hold that
sends Tony reeling into the hall McClane holds on as they
slam through several plastic board partitions They careen
across the hall into the stairwell door opening it and crash
into

STAIRWELL LANDING

then down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below
For a moment both men lie still McClane still holding onto
Tonys neck releases it and the mans head flops sickeningly
to the side

For a moment McClane just looks at the dead man Then slowly
methodically he begins to SEARCH HIM He turns all his pockets
inside out looks at his clothing labels stares long and very
hard at a California drivers license with Tonys picture on

it He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND
coming from somewhere attracts his attention

He rises moves cautiously to the source

the boots off

MCCLANE

He yanks off the boots and tosses them into the garbage Then
he pulls the body up and sets it down on a secretarys chair
He starts to push it along when he gets an idea and moves to

We notice hes got the dead mans machine gun and that a wooden
desk ruler protrudes from McClanes back pocket

The elevator doors close and the car starts down After its
dropped only half a floor McClane forces the doors open with
his fingers -- stopping the car between floors

Using the ruler he blocks open the inside doors then opens the
outside doors of the floor above (31st) with his fingers and
pulls himself up onto the carpeted floor then up onto the roof
of the car Once on the roof of the car he reaches over the

holes inches from his face show how close Karl came to nailing
him Sweat covers his face drips silently onto the aluminum

Karl listens patiently for sound Just then the two other
terrorists return

FRANCO
Nothing

Karl hesitates a moment fighting his instincts before finally
turning to go Suddenly the duct McClane is in GROANS slightly
under his weight Karl stops and looks up at the matrix of
aluminum duct work trying to single out the source of the
sound He steps back into the room and raises his rifle
Holding it upright he presses the barrel up into the belly

of McClanes air duct feeling for weight -- the weight of a
body

137 INSIDE THE AIR DUCT

McClane sees the indention of the barrel pressing into the
aluminum fifteen feet away There is a pause and another
three feet closer He can hear Karls footsteps on the
concrete -- moving slowly below the duct

138 ON KARL

His eyes are fixed above him on the air duct He presses the
barrel up again Still nothing

139 ON MCCLANE

Silently he moves his hand slowly draws his Beretta The
next indention presses up six feet away McClane points his
gun downward and waits
140 KARL 140
stops directly below him The barrel starts up and just
touches the duct under McClane when Franco returns to the

A crowd watches as the front doors of the building open We
SEE McClane who holds up Holly and in turn is supported by
SWAT men As REPORTERS start shouting questions McClane
breaks free of his entourage and holding Holly pushes into
the crowd

MCCLANE
(calling out)
Al Al you here --

The crowd eddys and surgessuddenly Powell is there and
McClane knows its him They stare at each other ten feet
apart and then theyre grinning extending their hands But
somehow a shake isnt enough and theyre embracing each other
like men whove lived through combat togetherwhich in fact
is the truth

Easily as crusted in dirt and blood as McClane he holds his
machine gun

EXT BUILDING

As the crowd panics trying to escape Karl locks eyes with
McClane and levels his gun McClane throws Holly to the
ground and grabs the dumbstruck Robinsons sidearm

But he doesnt get off a shot -- a lone gunshot stops Karl --
knocking him back through the doorway McClane looks back to
see Powell still sighting down the barrel of his 38

His hand is rock steady He sees McClanes look
