DISSOLVE TO

THE CORNFIELD - DUSK

It is dusk on a spring evening The sky is a robins-egg
blue and the wind is soft as a day-old chick Ray

Kinsella is working in the cornfield when a voice -- like
that of a public address announcer -- speaks to him
THE VOICE

If you build it he will come

Ray looks up and around but sees nothing that could be the
source of this sound All around him are empty fields

He stands quietly for a few moments then goes back to
work

THE VOICE
‘If you build it he will come

‘Ray jerks his head in all directions to see where-this

voice is coming from but again he sees nothing unusual
just the furrowed fields and a few hundred feet away
the massive old farmhouse with a sagging veranda on three
sides On the north veranda is a wooden porch swing where
Annie and Karin sit sipping lemonade and dreaming

RAY
(calls)
Annie what was that

ANNTE
(calls back)
What was what

RAY
That voice

ANNIE
What voice

Just now Like an announcement

Annie confers briefly with Karin then calls back to Ray

ANNIE
We didnt hear anything

RAY

Ray thinks for a second then shakes it off trying to

dislodge that thought from his mind and gets back to work

THE VOICE
‘If you build it he will come

Again he bolts upright and looks around Again he sees
nothing This is beginning to bug him He calls

RAY
Okay you mustve heard that

ON THE PORCH

Annie and Karin lock at each other and exchange a shrug
Annie extends her arms palms upward and calls to Ray

ANNIE
Sorry Come on Dinner

Annie leads Karin inside

-IN THE FIELD

Ray looks all around him with an Okay fellas whats the
joke look on his face But there is no one there He
puts down his tools and walks toward the house

RAY

INT DOCTORS OFFICE - DAY

Ray is plugged into some weird-looking contraption having
his hearing examined Then the Doctor shines a penlight
into his eyes shrugs and starts putting his gear away

DOCTOR
Well I cant find anything wrong I
could recommend a shrink but hey
people hear things all the time I
heard a voice once I was still living
with my parents then They worked in
the circus so I was raised in the
circus and I was training to be a
clown This one day Im putting on my
little red nose and I hear a voice
tells me to go to medical school Here
I am

Ray is not sure if he should ignore this or run

cuT TO

FARM SUPPLY STORE - DAY

Farmers are loading up with seed fertilizer and other
farmer stuff This is the kind of place where people also

RAYS FARM -— DAY

Ray is out in the fields again hard at work A breeze
picks up He stops for-a moment cocks an ear and looks
around All he sees are the empty fields Insects make
the only sounds He goes back tc work Then

THE VOICE
‘If you build it he will come

ll

He throws his tools down angrily and looks all around but
there is no apparent source of the voice Ray is pissed

RAY
All right who are you and what the
hell do you want from me

All he hears is a faraway echo

THE VOICE
If you build it he will come

This is serious Ray shakes his head and repeats the words
to himself

RAY
If you build it

As he thinks about these words some unexplained impulse
causes Ray to turn his head deliberately toward a portion
of the cornfield between him and the house

FLASH CUT

A BASEBALL FIELD

For the briefest of moments the dreamlike image of a
baseball field at night illuminated by floodlights flares
in over the lawn Standing on the edge of the field is
the figure of a man with his back to us Before we can see
anything else the image disappears

RAY

Rays eyes widen

RAY
»-he will come

FLASH CUT

THE MAN AND THE FIELD

The dream image flares in again this time closer to the
man He stands in the middle distance silhouetted by the
lights and we see he is wearing a uniform of some kind
He starts to turn slowly towards us but before we can see
his face the image disappears

20

CLOSE ON RAY

Rays mouth opens He half-laughs as if to say This
cant be But whatever is in his mind wont go away

RAY
he will come

FLASH CUT

THE MAN

Now we see him in head-andshoulders He has the muscular
neck of an athlete As he slowly turns we start to see a
bit of his weathered face before the image flares out

RAY

Wheels are turning inside his head He is trying to figure
all this out In the distance a bell is ringing He
looks 0S

EXT HOUSE - DUSK

Annie is on the veranda ringing the dinner bell hanging by
the front door

ANNIE

HER POINT OF VIEW - THE FIELDS
We see Ray emerge slowly from the fields the twilit sky
changing colors behind him
THE VERANDA

Annie leans against a post lazily watching Ray approach
She likes how he moves and how he looks

ANNIE
Hiya cutie

Ray climbs up the steps accepts her Kiss and instead of
following her into the house pulls her down with him onto
the swing He takes-her hand and looks into her eyes

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Ray and Annie in their pajamas brushing their teeth

getting ready for bed

ANNIE
You know what amazes me No one could
ever get you to believe in astrology
or ESP or reincarnation or heaven or
any of that stuff But thisI think
this shows real personal growth Ray

RAY
Thank you

Annie smiles but sees that Ray is troubled She hugs him

ANNIE
Oh sweetie I hope you know that even
though I make jokes Im going to visit
you every month wherever they put you

He offers her a weak smile and exits

INT RAY AND ANNIES BEDROOM - NIGHT
It is dark For a few seconds it is quiet Then

RAY
Did you know Babe Ruth copied his swing

ANNIE
If I did Id forgotten it

Ray sits up in the dark

RAY
I always felt cheated I never got to see
him play He was supposed to be so
graceful and agile So to actually get
to see him play againto let him play
again to right an old wrong

He shakes his head in wonder just to think of it
turns on the light

ANNIE
Wait a minute Bosco Are you actually
thinking of doing this

Annie

i

L

and

RAY

No
(then)

I mean I cant think of one good reason

why I should but

(takes a breath) i

Im thirty-eight years old I havea

wife a child and a mortgage and Im i

scared to death Im turning into my

father

ANNIE
Whats your father got to do with this

Ray tries to picture his father in his mind He speaks
softly but the words obviously have a great deal of
meaning for him

RAY
I never forgave him for getting old i
By the time he was as old as I am now
he was ancient He must have had
dreams but he never did anything about
them For all I know he may have even
heard voices too but he sure didnt
listen to them The man never did one
spontaneous thing in all the years I
Knew him Annie Im scared that thats
what growing up means Im afraid of
that happening to me And something
tells me this may be my last chance to
do something about it

(looks at her)

I want to build that field Do you
think Im crazy

She looks at him with great understanding

ANNIE
Yes

He smiles wanly She touches his face lovingly
ANNIE
I also think that if you feel you really
have to do thisthen you should do it
They hold each others gaze and Ray cannot remember when
he has loved her so much He takes her in his arms
Outside their window the field of corn lies waiting

curT TO

- THE CORNFIELD - DAY

Stalks of corn wave slowly in the breeze A bee buzzes
near one The light is yellow Suddenly the stalks bend
violently to the ground as Rays tractor plows them under

ON THE TRACTOR

Ray drives Karin rides shotgun holding the large detailed
diagram Ray has drawn of the ballparks dimensions

RAY
Ty Cobb called him the greatest left
fielder of all time His glove was
Calied the place where triples go to
die

HIGH ANGLE

The tractor turns to plow under more corn and we can see
the size of the area Ray has staked off with marker sticks

KARIN (V0)
Could he hit

RAY (VO)
Lifetime 356 average Third highest
in history

Karin whistles

ANOTHER ANGLE

By the side of the road an old man and woman stand and
watch these neighbors plow under their corn They look at
each other as if to say Could it be Communists

KARIN (VO)
Whyd they called him Shoeless Joe

SEEDING THE FIELD - DAY

It is days later an area the size of a baseball field has
been plowed under and Ray is seeding it

RAY (V0)
When he was still in the minors he
bought a new pair of spikes and they
hurt his feet About the sixth inning
he took them off and played the outfield
in just his socks The other players
kidded him called him Shoeless Joe and
the name stuck

WATERING THE GRASS - NIGHT-

We can see roughly where the grass has been planted and
where the dirt will be smoothed out for the base paths
Ray stands stock-still in the moonlight water hose in

hand patiently misting the baby grass little Karin at his

side

RAY (V0)
Then in 1919 his team the Chicago
White Sox threw the World Series

KARIN (V0)
Whats threw

RAY (V0)
They iost it on purpose Gamblers paid
them to

SIDE OF THE ROAD

Now dozens of families stand to watch silent and
dumb-eyed at what has obviously become a daily spectacle
among the townspeople Some snap photos

RAY (V0)
Except Shoeless Joe

SMOOTHING OUT THE FIELD - DAY

Ray smooths out the base paths with a large roller as
Annie and Karin follow behind with rakes On either side
of the base paths the infield and outfield grass is
growing

RAY (VO)
Nobody could prove anything one way or
another but he was the one guy who
probably wasnt in on it

INT HARDWARE STORE - DAY

Ray Annie and Karin wait as the cashier totals up their
load of lumber and hardware

RAY
I mean if he was supposed to be throwing
it how do you explain the fact he hit

first time that a crowd of spectators -- employees and
customers -- has been watching him and whispering among
themselves They look at him as if he had two heads i

Ray turns his attention back to writing a check for his
purchases He deadpans to Annie

RAY

ANNIE

(equally deadpan)
Remlak wont like that

RAY
Thats his problem And tell him to

RAY

THE LIGHT STANDARD - NIGHT

Atop the aluminum-painted poles an array of store-bought
floodlights switch on flaring against the blue-black sky
In this sharp white light the grass glows parrot green
cool as mint soft as a cashmere blanket Annie and Karin
watch as Ray puts down the clean white bases which pick
up the light like little moons on a cold clear night

RAY
My father said he saw him years later
playing under a made-up name in some
tenth-rate league in Carolina Hed put
on fifty pounds and the spring was gone
from his step but he could still hit
Dad used to say no one could hit like
Shoeless Joe

Ray is smiling wistfully
ANNIE
Thats the first time Ive ever seen you
smile as you mentioned your father
Ray considers that

KARIN
How come

ANNIE
Come on you Bed time

Annie hoists Karin on her shoulders with a grunt and the
three climb their way down the bleachers Rays hand
steadies Annie as she takes one of the steps

RAY
Careful

Moonlight butters the Iowa night They walk along the side
of the field and Ray stops He looks at the field

onto the porch and flicks the switch shutting off the
floodlights over the field

Annie lowers her head against his chest and goes back to
sleep Outside the trees are fully leafed

DISSCLVE TO

The trees are almost bare now and theres a Halloween
pumpkin in the front window of the house The cornstalks

while Ray sits in the standswaiting

Ray opens his eyes and turns to see Karin kneeling on the
kitchen counter looking out the window Ray and Annie
exchange a quick glance and Ray walks to the window

EXT THE WINDOW 48

Seen from outside as Rays head appears and looks out
He sees something out there and just looks at it

i

RAYS POINT OF VIEW

There is a Man standing on the edge of the baseball field
He is wearing a baseball uniform An old-fashioned one

INT HOUSE

Ray turns to Annie She locks out and nods thoughtfully
Annie stays very calm in emergencies

ANNIE
Well put up some coffee You go ahead

Ray takes a breath and steps out onto the veranda The
night sky seems close enough to touch

EXT HOUSE

On the porch wall Ray finds the switch holds his breath
flicks it and the floodlights sputter to life

THE MAN
steps onto the field on his uniform is a large S with

an O in the top crook an X in the bottom and an
American flag with forty-eight stars on his left sleeve

RAY

walks through the swirling ground mist toward the field

RAYS POINT OF VIEW

Moving closer to the field we see the Man standing out in

left field Feet spread wide body bent forward from the
waist hands on hips he waits

RAY

Rays mouth is dry He reaches home plate and picks up one
of the bats lying beside the pail of hard balls The back
of his neck tingles Then he picks up one of the balls

IN THE OUTFIELD

The Man spreads his feet pounds his small old-style
glove and waits to field the ball

AT HOME PLATE

Ray tosses the ball a few feet into the air and swings at
it And misses His face reddens he clears his throat
and tries again This time he connects

THE ‘FIELD

He has hit a grounder that would be easily fielded by a
shortstop had there been one but it bounces through and
falls into left field The Man runs in for it scoops it
up cleanly and throws it back to the plate

Ray is thrilled He hits another ground ball and this
too is fielded cleanly Then another which the Man
deftly short-hops Ray hollers out to him

RAY
Hows the field play

THE MAN
Its good The ball bounces true

Ray smiles with pride He tosses up another ball gives
it his best swing and is thrilled to see he has actually
lofted one into the air But into center field The Man
sprints across the outfield and makes a lovely catch in

“short center Instead of throwing the ball in the Man

runs it in loping toward home plate Rays heart thumps

RAY
Hi

The Man nods at him takes the bat and tests it to feel
its weight

RAY
Ray Kinsella

THE MAN
Joe Jackson

Ray is thrilled to hear the words spoken It is Shceless
Joe Jackson after all who stands not five feet away from
him trying out all the bats now Ray isnt quite sure if
he should talk or ask questions or just stand there
Finally he cant help himself

RAY
I bet its good to be playing again
huh

SHOELESS JOE
It was like having part of me amputated

ree ESD RE RS ISD ee RECT EON

Joe looks over at Ray now his dark eyes evincing the pain
his steady voice tries to conceal

SHOELESS JOE
Ive heard that old man wake up and
scratch itchy legs thatve been dust for
fifty years That was me Id wake up
in the night with the smell of the
ballpark in my nose and the cool of the
grass on my feet The thrill of the
grass

He has found the bat he likes

SHOELESS JOE
Can you pitch

RAY
(with false
modesty)
Yeah Im not bad

Joe hands Ray the bucket of balls Ray can barely contain
his excitement as he races to the mound He stands on the
rubber and faces Joe at the plate

RAY
Dont we need a catcher

SHOELESS JOE
Not if you can get it near the plate
we dont

Ray smiles takes a breath and starts his windup during
which he says aloud to himself

RAY
I am pitching to Shoeless Joe Jackson

He makes a pitch Its not a very good one and Joe’ has
to step across the plate to make contact but his swing is
graceful compact and effortlessly powerful He drives the
ball against the fence

Ray watches it with wonder and when he turns back Jackson
is gesturing with the bat for him to make the next pitch
Ray makes the standard pitchers gesture for a curve ball

RAY
See if you can hit my curve

He goes into an elaborate windup throws it it does not
curve much and Jackson whistles it right by Rays ear

oscar neopranneemncnrensenntn

RAY
Yes he can hit the curve

SHOELESS JOE
Stick with fast balls kid

RAY
You bet

Ray makes another pitch and Jackson hits a line drive down
the third base line Then a smoker down the first base
line Ray is mightily impressed

RAY
Wow

SHOELESS JOE
Damn this feels good Put it right
here huh

Joe holds the bat out low over the plate and Ray pitches
it reasonably close to that spot Jackson hits it out of
the park and beams Ray brightens up with remembrance

RAY
Right you were a low ball hitter

SHOELESS JOE
Oh man I did love this game You know
Id have played for food money It was

the game the sounds the smells You
ever held a glove or a ball to your
face

Ray smiles as he walks in from the mound

RAY
Yeah

SHOELESS JOE
And it was riding the trains from town
to town And the hotels with brass
spittoons in the lobbies and brass beds
in the rooms And it was the crowd
getting to their feet when the ball was

Joe laughs and walks to the outfield Annie puts her arm
around Ray and snuggles her head against his chest

Nearby brook water splashes softly in the darkness a frog

into the fence

THE FIELD

Karin and Ray sit on the bleachers eating peanuts while
Shoeless Joe and his seven teammates practice (Three
including Shoeless Joe are in the outfield two more in
the infield one pitches one catches and one bats)

The men are all in their twenties or thirties but show the
sheer enjoyment of returning after an absence of sixty-five
years to the game they love -

Ray directs Karins attention to thé left fielder

RAY
Watch Joe Watch his feet as the
pitcher gets the sign and starts to
itch A good left fielder knows what
pitch is coming and he can teil from
the angle of the bat where the balls
going to be hit

At the sharp crack of the bat Shoeless Joe whirls takes
five loping strides toward the fence turns again reaches
up and the ball smacks into his glove

Karin cheers One of the players good-naturedly boos

Ease his pain over and over again while an Irate Mother
has the floor holding up a novel

IRATE MOTHER
and I say smut and filth like this has
no place in our schools

A large portion of the audience applauds Annie whispers
snarlingly to Ray

ANNIE
Fascist Id like to ease her pain

Ray is still lost in thought

PRINCIPAL
Mrs Perkins the book you are waving
about is hardly smut It is considered
by many critics as the classic novel
about growing up in the 1960s

ANNIE
(whispers to Ray) ‘
I read it four times Funniest book I
ever read

IRATE MOTHER
Its pornography

PRINCIPAL
The Supreme Court said its not And
its author Mr Mann ---

ANGRY FATHER
-- is sick

PRINCIPAL
Terence Mann is a Pulitzer prize-winner
and was widely regarded as the finest
Satirist of his time

IRATE MOTHER
Well I think hes a pervert and quite
probably a Communist too

The crowd murmurs its assent

ANNIE
(to Ray)
What planet are these people from

Ray looks as if he is starting to realize something

ANOTHER PARENT

(reading from

notes)
The so-called novels of Terence Mann
endorse promiscuity godlessness the
mongrelization of racés and disrespect
to high-ranking officers of the United
States Army And thats why right-
thinking school boards all across the
country have been banning this guys
shit since 1969

RAY
(to himself) i
Terence Mann

IRATE MOTHER
You know why he stopped writing books
Because he masturbates

ANNIE
(to Ray)
I cant take this anymore

RAY
(very interested)
‘Terence Mann

Annie stands and smiles disarmingly

ANNIE

(very reasonably)
Excuse me madam but youre speaking
of something about which you dont know
squat Terence Mann was a warm and
gentle voice of reason during a time of
great madness He coined the phrase
Make Love Not War When others were
chanting Burn baby burn he was
writing about love and peace and
understanding He hélped define an era
And a generation And he helped us
laugh at ourselves I cherished every
one of his books and I dearly wish hed
write more And if you had experienced
even a little bit of the Sixties you
might feel the same way too

IRATE MOTHER
I experienced the Sixties

ANNIE
No I think you had two Fifties and
moved right on to the Seventies

IRATE MOTHER
Oh yeah Well your husband plowed under
his corn and built a baseball field

The crowd-oohs and aahs

ANNIE
Now theres an intelligent response

IRATE MOTHER
The weirdo

Ray is so excited at his revelation that he really wants
to leave immediately He tugs Annies sleeve

he is cautioning her not to get embroiled in trouble

angry finger at the woman

well as stairs to the apartments above it

There are half-a-dozen mail boxes on the wall Ray checks
the names He smiles

INSERT- MAILBOXES

All but one have immigrant names The first one reads

Ray turns to the storefront door Instead of a buzzer
there is a long wire with a weight on its end hanging from
a hole at the top of the door Next to the wire is a
handwritten note taped to the door which reads you
better have a goddamn good reason for ringing this bell

Ray laughs This guy is great He pulls on the wire on
the other side of the door a bell rings

Ray has to struggle to control his nervousness He takes

a breath He hears footsteps inside approaching the door

Ee cannot help but smile with delight at the thought of
meeting one of his cultural heroes

The door opens Terence Mann is menacingly huge He
glares at Ray and roars

MANN
Who the fuck are you-

Ray is momentarily taken aback but he figures maybe the
guy is joking so he just smiles and plunges ahead

Now get the fuck out of here

And he slams the door shut again Ray is flabbergasted
He is thinking furiously Then he notices that in slamming
the door the latch has not locked in place He thinks
makes up his mind and quietly opens the door i

Mann has returned to work his back to the door
Ray enters the loft his left hand in his jacket pocket i
When he is halfway across the loft he clears his throat
Mann spins around

MANN
Now youve pissed me off

RAY
Okay hold it right there

He juts his pocketed hand forward as if he had a gun in
his jacket

RAY
I was hoping I wouldnt have to do it
this way

MANN

RAY

RAY

little while then - what are you

Mann has found a crowbar among his tools and is advancing
toward Ray

MANN
Im going to beat you with a crowbar
till you go away

Understandably this makes Ray nervous

RAY
Whoa Wait You cant do that

MANN
(still advancing)
What are there rules Theres no
rules

Mann is almost to him now the crowbar raised above his
head

RAY
Youre a pacifist

Mann stops He thinks He lowers the crowbar

RAY

Mann sits tensely beside Ray who drives with his right
hand while his left hand remains in his pocket
substituting for a gun

MANN
You do this often

RAY
No Its my first time So be gentle

Ray laughs nervously and is embarrassed to see Mann not
sharing the humor

RAY
You used to have a sense of humor

MANN
Things used to be funny

Ray pulls up at an intersection He has to choose between
left and right Behind hin cars are honking Ray doesnt
have a clue which way to go He sighs
RAY
Im sorry This is really humiliating
Which way is’ Fenway
Mann shakes his head then tilts it to the left

RAY
Thank you

Ray makes the turn and heads off down the street

MANN
Youre really inept at this arent you

Ray grins sheepishly and nods Mann laughs

MANN
I mean youre like a total bumbler

Ray chuckles his reluctant acceptance of the truth

MANN
‘Bozo the Kidnapper

RAY
(no longer so
amused)
Okay okay

After a few moments Ray decides to break the ice

RAY
Can I ask you a question Something

Mann nods Hes been asked this question a million times

MANN
No I never slept with her

SECTION SEVENTEEN 92

Ray and Mann emerge into the sunlight and walk down the
aisle toward the field

RAY
God this place is so beautiful

The grass is so green you can almost smell it Looking
around the old ballpark they see only about twenty or
thirty die-hard fans in the stands for batting practice
a half-dozen players are grouped around the batting cage
as one player hits to several others in the field A few
sportswriters and other civilians stand near the dugouts

Ray and Mann stop at the first row right behind the Red
Sox on-deck circle lean on the railing and talk

RAY
It could be 1912 out there for all this
place has changed Babe Ruth stood on
that very mound as a pitcher long before
anyone knew he could hit home runs
Same mound

Why are we here Ray
RAY

THE GAME - NIGHT 93

The game is in progress Ray and Mann are in their fifth
row seats They do not speak

At one point Ray becomes suddenly and strangely aware that
something is about to happen He looks at Mann who is just
watching the game Then he looks at the scoreboard

THE SCOREBOARD 94
Fenway Park has a sophisticated scoreboard that flashes
pictures of the batter and pitcher and can show instant
replays of some of the action

Right now the display is replaced by an oddly glowing
message The sounds of the stadium the game and the
crowd fade out

There is only the message

Lifetime Statistics

The message does not just glow it pulsates It looks
almost otherworldly phosphorescent clearly unlike
anything ever seen before on a ballpark scoreboard

RAY AND MANN 5

Ray looks around him The sounds of the game return and
from the unconcerned faces of the people near him he
realizes that no one else can see the message He opens
his program and starts writing it down Mann notices this
but cannot see what Ray is writing

Then Ray hears The Voice

THE VOICE

Mann looks at Ray curiously trying to read this new
attitude

program -- at the handwritten legend of Moonlight Graham
who played one game fifty-seven years ago but did not get
to bat - and follows Mann out of the ballpark

Ray puts the car in gear makes a wide turn and starts to

he appears tense almost frightened

Near Chisholm the land is getting ever weirder It looks
like a pasture rooted and rerooted by giant hogs It has
been split and gutted greenery has grown back but at
weird and unnatural angles

And there were times when children
could not afford eyeglasses or milk or
clothing Yet no child was ever denied
these essentials because in the
background there was always Doctor
Graham Without any fanfare or

EXT CHISHOLM RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT 112

Ray walks by the old movie theatre which sits at the edge
of a residential street The Godfather is playing He
neds at an elderly man who passes him on the street He
passes a darkened house and notices there is a sign of some
kind in its unlit front window He takes another two or
three steps before he has to stop to take a better look at
the sign

THE SIGN
It takes a second to make out the image in the dark but

it is a head shot of Richard Nixon Above it says Four
More Years Below it reads Re-Elect The President

RAY

is puzzled He turns and looks at the theatre marquee

THE THEATRE MARQUEE

Under the letters that spell out The Godfather are
smaller letters that read Nominated for 10 Academy
Awards

RAY

frowns He says the word to himself

Nominated

Ray now looks at the car parked nearest to him

THE CAR

It is an old Mustang The annual tag on the license plate
reads 1972

RAY

looks’ around

HIS POINT OF VIEW

All the cars on the street are pre-1972 And still walking

down the block away from him is the elderly man Ray passed
moments earlier

The man is about sixty-five years old stooped a little
but the body is still lithe an athletes body He is

They enter the hallway of the old school the smell of
varnish and chalk almost palpable

Bottom of the eighth and we were way

most of a month but hadnt seen any
action Just then old John McGraw
points a bony finger at me and says

my glove and ran out onto the field

They reach a varnished door with an opaque glass inset and
enter Doc Grahams office

Doc seats himself behind a cluttered desk and motions Ray

chewing

It hits the back of the sofa a few feet from Ray and hangs
there like a white fly

RAY
I was warned about you

DOC GRAHAM
Anyway one inning later the gamé was
over and so was I

RAY
And what was that like

DOC GRAHAM
It was like coming this close to your
dreams and then watching them brush
past you like a stranger in a crowd

Ray nods and a look of understanding begins to appear on
his face He looks out the window focused on faraway

DOC GRAHAM

Except at the time you dont think
much of it Hardly anybody recognizes
the most significant moment of their
life when theyre happening Back then
I just figured thered be plenty more

Now let me ask you a question Ray
- Kinsella What makes that half-inning
so interesting that you come all the way
from Iowa to ask me about it sixty-five
years later

and

Ray chooses his words carefully

RAY
I didnt really know till just now But
I think its to ask you if you could do
anything you wanted toif you could
have a wish

DOC GRAHAM
Ahh

Doc nods his understanding He smiles wryly takes a new
piece of paper and bites off a little section

DOC GRAHAM
And are you the kind of man who could
grant me that wish

RAY
I dont know Im just asking

Doc leans his left elbow on the desk and rubs his forehead
thoughtfully with a palm as if it were an eraser that
could erase the years and take him back to 1929 and the
Polo Grounds in New York

DOC GRAHAM
I never got to bat in the major leagues
Id have liked the chance -- just once

-- to stare down a big league pitcher
Stare him down and then just as he goes
into the windup -- wink Make him
wonder if I know something he doesnt
Thats what I wish for The chance to
squint my eyes when the sky is so blue
it hurts to look at it and to feel the
‘tingle that runs up your arms when you
connect dead-on The chance to run the
bases stretch a double to a triple and
flop race-first into third wrapping my
arm around the bag Thats my wish Ray
Kinsellathats my wish

Ray begins to smile Graham is staring intently at hin
DOC GRAHAM
Is there enough magic floating around
in the night out there for you to make
that wish come true

RAY
What would you do if I said Yes

DOC GRAHAM
I think I might actually believe you

RAY
There is a place where things like that

happen And if you want to go there
I can take you

Docs eyes start to glisten and he offers an embarrassed
smile as he wipes away a tear

DOC GRAHAM
If it means leaving Chisholm

He shakes his head no Ray is surprised

RAY
I understand but I think youre
supposed to come with us

DOC GRAHAM
This is my most special place in the
world Ray Once a place touches you
like this the wind never blows so cold
again You feel for it like it was your
child I cant leave here

Ray cannot believe the man wont leave Chisholm for his
dream

RAY
But your wish

DOC GRAHAM
Itll stay one I was born here lived
here and Ill die here Thats okay
Ill have no regrets

RAY
But sixty-five years ago -- for five
minutes -- you came this close
holds up two
fingers

It would kill some men to get that close
to their dream and never touch it
Theyd consider it a tragedy

DOC GRAHAM
Sonif Id only gotten to be a doctor
for five minutesnow that would have
been a tragedy

Those words fill up the room and Ray sinks back against
the couch

It is later that same night and Ray has been recounting
his experience with Doc Graham to Mann who appears quietly

troubled

RAY
And then I figured maybe were not
supposed to take him with us So now
I dont know why the hell we were
supposed to come here

MANN
Maybe it was to find out if one inning
can change the world

RAY
Did it

MANN
It did for these people If hed gotten
a hit he mightve stayed there

Your wife called before She wants you

I asked the bank if we could miss a

paper now and he says if we dont sell
to them theyll foreclose Ray we
dont have the money

As they turn onto the highway near the lake a Teenager
with a dufflebag appears on the side of the road his arm
raised in a hitchhikers stance Ray pulls the car over
to the side of the road

Archie sleeps in the backseat

MANN
Im dying to ask him if he has a

the minors

MANN
Maybe we can give it to him

RAY
Funny the way he described towns
finding you a job so you can play on
their teamthey havent done that for
years My Dad did that for a while
But that was in the Twenties

MANN
What happened to your father

RAY
He never made it as ball player so he
tried to get his son to make it for hin
By the time I was ten playing baseball
got to be like eating vegetables or
taking out the garbage so when I was
fourteen I started to refuse Can you
believe that An American boy refusing
to have a catch with his father

MANN
Why at fourteen

RAY
Thats when I read The Boat Rocker by
Terence Mann

MANN
Oh God
RAY
I never played catch with him again

MANN
What was the awful thing you said

RAY

I said I could never respect a man whose
hero was a criminal

MANN
Who was his hero

RAY
‘Shoeless Joe Jackson

Mann considers this all very carefully

MANN
You knew he wasnt a criminal

Ray nods

MANN
Then whyd you say it

RAY
I was seventeen

Mann nods with growing understanding

MANN
So this is your penance
RAY
Ioknow I cant bring my father
back
MANN
SO the least you can do is bring back
his hero
Ray nods
MANN

Well now we know what everybodys
purpose here isexcept mine

Ray looks at him He hadnt thought of that After a few
moments Ray points to something in the distance

POINT OF VIEW 130

Something down the road in the midst of all this flat
farmland is glowing in the night

It is an illuminated baseball diamond in a cornfield

RAY AND ANNIES FARM - NIGHT 131

Ray turns the Datsun into the long driveway and with a
rumble crosses the metal cattle guard that keeps livestock
from escaping to the roadway

He eases the car to a stop in front of the house and as
the three men unfold themselves from the car Karin bolts
from the back door of the house a blur of white blouse and
pink pedal pushers She flings herself into Rays arms
and hugs his neck in unrestrained joy

KARIN
Daddy

Then Annie appears too They kiss while Mann and Archie
wait to be introduced Finally Mann clears his throat

RAY
( (beaming)
Karin AnnieThis is Terence Mann

MANN

KARIN
Hiya Terry

Annie steps forward wiping some curls from her eyes with
avhand that has recently been immersed in flour She
smiles wipes the hand on the thigh of her jeans and
shakes his hand

ANNIE

132 EXT BASEBALL FIELD NIGHT 132

Ray and Annie walk silently with their arms around each
other as they lead Mann Archie and Karin to the bleachers

Manns eyes widen as several of the players shout greetings
to Ray

SHOELESS JOE

MANN
Its a pleasure to meet you

SHOELESS JOE
Pleasures mine
(to Ray)
Ray I hope you dont mind but we got
tired of just having practices so we
brought another team out with us so we
could have some real games

He points to the visitors bench and indeed there are
a dozen or so more old-time baseball players in old-time
baseball uniforms

RAY
I dont mind Whered they come from

SHOELESS JOE
(chuckles)
Whered we come from Man you wouldnt
believe how many guys wanted to play
here We had to beat em off with a
stick

ARCHIE
(from the
bleachers)
Hey thats Mel Ott And Carl Hubbell
Those are the New York Giants

SHOELESS JOE
With a couple of Cardinals and As
thrown in for good measure Ty Cobb
wanted to play but none of us could
stand the sonofabitch when we were
alive so we told him to stuff it
(to Archie)
Hey are you Graham

Archie quickly scampers down the bleachers onto the field
shakes Joes hand and runs to the dugout

MANN

RAY
Its more than that Its perfect

cUuT TO

133 THE GAME

The White Sox are in the field the Giants at bat A Giant
hitter bunts and the runner on second takes third despite
a close throw

Mann Ray Karin and Annie are in ‘the stands Mann keeping

score
MANN
Does he get a hit for that
RAY
Karin
KARIN
Um no The batter was trying to
sacrifice
RAY

So how do you score it

KARIN
Fielders choice

RAY
Very good

i

Mann is impressed He lifts Karin up from her seat on the
row below them and places her next to him to help him

MANN
You better sit here

Karin beams Ray taps Mann and points to the plate

RAY
Look

Archie Graham now wearing a Giants uniform -- drops one
of the two bats he has been swinging in the on-deck circle
and advances on the plate slashing the air with a
brand-new bat the color of vanilla ice cream He plants
himself in the batters box then cocks the bat the top
end of it trembling as if he were stirring something and
waits for the pitch”

The pitcher looks in for his signs Archie stares back
As the pitcher goes into his windup Archie winks at him

There is a moment of confusion and then anger on the
pitchers face and when the ball speeds to the plate it
is aimed right at Archies head He dives out of the way
and hits the dirt hard The Catcher chuckles through his
mask

CATCHER
Good thing for you that wasnt his
fastball

Archie digs in again at the plate but backs up just a
little Now his look to the pitcher is one of
determination

ARCHIE
Come on lets see your fastball

The pitcher smiles winds up and throws Very fast And
right at Archies chin Again he has to dive out of the
way This time however he gets right up and immediately
appeals to the Umpire

ARCHIE
Hey ump how about a warning

UMPIRE
Sure Watch out-you dont get killed

Both benches laugh at that Archie holds up his hands to
call time and steps out of the batters box The on-deck
batter Mel Ott comes over

oTT
Okay kid first two were high and
tight where do you think the next ones
going to be

ARCHIE
Either low and away or in my ear

ott
He dont want to load the bases Look
for low and away

Archie nods and starts to walk back to the plate

oTT
But watch out for in your ear

Archie takes his place in the batters box again He still
looks determined but a little less cocky The next pitch
is a curve that looks as if its heading right for him
But he holds his ground and when the ball breaks down and
away he steps in snaps the bat forward and hits it

The ball sails in a high arc to right center The center
fielder backs up a couple of steps lopes a few strides to
his left and makes the catch

Archie is out but the runner on third tags up and scores
As Archie curls across the diamond from the first baseline
to the Giants bench he hears cheering

In the stands Ray Annie Karin and Mann are giving him
a standing ovation In return he touches the brim of his
cap a ballplayers cool resporise to adulation

MANN
(laughs)
‘Look at that Mr Cool

But when Archie gets to the bench he cant contain himself
anymore He leaps up and lets out a cheer of pure joy

DISSOLVE TO

THE FIELD - LATER

The game has ended and players are rough-housing and
joking as they slowly make their way to the door in the
outfield fence Ray and Mann are talking to some of the

- players over the fence

MANN
Where do you go when you walk through
that door What do you do

RAY

He spots Archie jogging off the field

RAY
Hey slugger congratulations

ARCHIE

disappearing through the outfield door Ray nods
understandingly

RAY
Good game Archie
ARCHIE

MANN

Good night kid

Ray Karin Annie and Mann watch Archie jog towards the

rest of the players When he reaches the fence he turns
back to them

ARCHIE
Mr Kinsella

Ray turns toward him Archie looks as if he knows more
than hes saying

ARCHIE
Thank you for bringing me here I
couldnt have wished for anything more

Ray recognizes there may be more behind those words than

just a teenagers pleasure But he decides not to ask any
questions

RAY
I know Youre welcome

Archie runs through the door in the fence and vanishes

Mann and Karin eat their country breakfasts at one end of
the table while at the other end Annie and Ray sit in

Either way we lose the farm Maybe we
can make it a condition of the sale that
they keep the field up
ANNIE
Forget it Theyre buying up single
farms all around us make it one big
farm First thing theyll do is plow
under your field
Ray just sits there letting that sink in

Ray and Mann walking

MANN
I dont have a lot of money Ray but
maybe I could pitch in a little

RAY
Fine You can put in twenty bucks for

reason you were supposed to find me was

RAY
More likely its that youre supposed
to start writing again About this

Manns expression suddenly turns to one of indignation

MANN
One thing has nothing to do with the
other i

RAY
Im not sure I agree with that

MANN
Youre not only stubborn youre stupid

RAY
That I wont argue with

Annie emerges from the house and calls to Ray

dog and Annie an Ray snuggle together to watch the game

ANNIE
Everything is so perfect here

RAY
Whatever I have to do to save this
place Ill do

ANNIE
I know

Suddenly Ray snaps his head to the side as one does to
pick up a distant sound

RAY
Hes here

They look and see Marks car heading up the gravel lane
He parks the car at the eage of the field and the game
stops as he walks right across it completely mindless of
the players Since he doesnt sea any of them a few
actually have to move out of his way He approaches the
bottom of the bleachers

RAY
Youre interrupting the game Mark

Mark shakes his head sadly at the thought that these
otherwise sensible relations have lost their minds

MARK
Ray its time to put away our little
fantasies and come down to earth

RAY
Its not a fantasy Mark Theyre real

Mark obviously doesnt see anyone on the field

MARK
(emphatically)
Whos real

RAY
Shoeless Joe Jackson The White Sox

Ray smiles savoring the moment

Okay this is all fascinating but the
fact remains that you dont have the
money to bring the mortgage up to date

Theyll walk out to the bleachers and
sit in shirtsleeves in the perfect
evening or theyll find they have i
reserved seats somewhere in the i
grandstand or along one of the baselines
wherever they sat when they were
children and cheered their heroes
Theyll watch the game and it will be
as if theyd dipped themselves in magic
waters The memories will be so thick
theyll have to brush them away from
their faces

hand to her to wait His eyes are on young Archie Grahan
YOUNG ARCHIE GRAHAM 150
As Graham gets closer his features begin to change and
his step slows He reaches the end of the fence -- around
which no player can pass and when he emerges from the
shadows on the bleachers side he is no longer young

he delivers a series of sharp blows between her shoulder
blades with the heel of his other hand

Annie honks again Ray waves her to him Mark cannot
believe what he is seeing

Suddenly Karins diaphragm expands as she sucks in air
Doc reaches around and pries her mouth open releasing a
sizable piece of hog dog and bun

As he turns her over we can see the blueness disappearing
from her face as she continues to breathe deeply Doc
peels back each eyelid in turn stares at the pupil for a
few seconds and lets the eye close

DOC GRAHAM
Shes okay I dont think the fall
really hurt her just the dog in her
throat Shell be coming around in a
minute or two

RAY
(sighs deeply)
Thank you Doc

Doc looks deeply into Rays eyes

DOC GRAHAM
No son -Thank you

It just now sinking for Ray what Doc Graham has sacrificed

to save the child Ray looks to the field and then back
at the Doctor

RAY
Oh my God you cant go back

DOC GRAHAM
Its okay
(nods knowingly)

MARK AND ANNIE

and cannot explain it

The Catcher is now walking toward Ray

door in the outfield fence

John starts to walk off toward the door in the outfield
fence

RAY
Hey

John turns back Ray is holding a ball

RAY
You wanna have a catch

John closes his eyes for a second and when he opens them
there is the hint of moisture Does he know Ray is his

son

JOHN
Id like that

Ray tosses him the ball picks up a glove lying there and
puts it on

They throw the ball back and forth
And as we pull up higher and higher we see a father and son

bathed by white floodlights and car headlightson the

silent satiny green of a baseball diamond at the edge of
a cornfield

FADE OUT
