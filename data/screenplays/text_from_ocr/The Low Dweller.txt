It will be time to set out soon to hunt and eat and fatten
But not yet

THE LOW DWELLER

EXT SHAGBARK TREE - NIGHT

and there’s a pie-eyed man at the base late twenties sturdy
and thick-wristed His eyes are dark brown but the Liquor’ Ss
in him and they’re barely open now

This is the low dweller CHARLIE ‘SLIM’ HENDRICK

POLICE SIRENS fill the air Distant but encroaching

There’s not a mark on him to explain the blood on his shirt -
it’s not his He stirs a bit as if nudged and his eyes raise

SLIM’S POV

across the rural dirt road a weathered farmhouse sits vacant
on the land An aged ‘For Sale’ sign peeks above the brown
summer overgrowth The Gray Fox saunters away

The SIRENS close in and throw their blue-red lights onto the
trees and the tall grass and finallySlim

And then from the sky MAYFLIES FALL In sheets Weightless
thin-winged insects

DEPUTY MULBY NOLAN late twenties approaches cautiously with
YOUNG DEPUTY in tow Guns drawn Nolan’s strapping virile
and at a modest twenty-seven already earmarked for Sheriff

DEPUTY NOLAN
Slim Slim tell me what’s goin’ on

YOUNG DEPUTY
Speak up you sumabitch

Young Deputy advances on Slim

The Mayflies twitch on the ground

DISSOLVE TO

A DEAD DOG — MORNING — SUMMER

on the edge of a wheat field It’s not pretty blood and
flesh like the sun and heat have been at it for days and now
the maggots and fleas and buzzards have taken over

ACROSS THE RURAL HIGHWAY ROAD through the heat-haze the
high barbed wire perimeter fence ofa prison disrupts a
Cloudless blue sky

WRITTEN WORDS
Four years later 1985 Lowlands

Guards escort Slim towards the gate They remove the
handcuffs and the gates open and Slim steps out not joyous
or doleful he just steps out and squints from the sun and
regards the dog a moment

Slim’s head slumps and his eyes are wearied and fading and
blood paints his hand covering the bullet hole in his side

Slim

We HEAR FOOTSTEPS NEARBY Nolan guiets his breathing Slim
lifts his head slightly

SLIMS POV

looking out a window to the land flanking the home And
suddenly the darkness is light-flooded land Gold and warm
with tall wheat

And and now Raymond is there walking the field And there
there’s Jonah the old man and hes talking to his Godson

And Gabby his love enters with folded starched sheets
pulled from clotheslines

They are talking something of great interest but little
importance

Darkness falis once again

SLIM
Stares blankly outside the window Nolan nudges Slim

ON A GORGEOUS FIELD OF WHEAT - SOME YEARS LATER

THE SUN LAY ON THE WHEAT and warms it A sea of gold The sky
is blue and endless All is quiet

Ben comes into view now eight hair the color of barley He
walks about aimlessly letting the wheat heads tickle his
open palm He turns now to -

SLIM

walking the field his field earnestly checking the beards
and kernels At peace

BEN
Dad
SLIM
What is it
BEN
It’s hot
SLIM

You wanna go inside
(Slim looks up Ben nods)
Come here
Ben walks towards Slim and Slim the man with the black-eyed
dog inside him takes the boy into his arms and we watch as
they approach the weathered farmhouse painted and
refurbished

Brady sits on the porch Swing beside Leeny her head ‘resting —
on his shoulder

BRADY
Goin’ in already

SLIM
He’s tired

Slim walks inside the home

And soon very soon it will be time to harvest
But not yet

FADE OUT

THE END
