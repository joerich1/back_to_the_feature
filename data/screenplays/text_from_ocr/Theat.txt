EXT FOREST - DAY

The forest is green and still Morning birds chirp to the new
day and sunlight squeezes through the cracks of the leaves

SHANNON BROOKE tall and skinny jogs down a trail Her
hair tied back tosses itself side to side and she mouths
to the music she listens to

She jogs downhill towards a stream and watches the water run
downstream as she jogs by

Shannon stops at a tree and rests She pops open her water
bottle and squirts some in her mouth Her cell phone rings

SHANNON
(Into phone)
Hello
TERRI (VO)

Hey You’re awake
Shannon begins to walk on the trail

SHANNON
I’m jogging

TERRI (VO)
When did you start

SHANNON
Just last weekend

TERRI (VO)
Cool maybe I can start joining you
when I’m able to get off my ass

SHANNON
Yeah That’ll be great I found
this perfect trail and the view is
amazing

TERRI (VO)
Well I want to see this so you’re
going to have to help me get up
early Any way I tried calling the
house phone but nobody answered so
that’s why I’m calling your cell

SHANNON
Tom is probably still asleep and
Ashley is starting to sleep in
later

(MORE)
SHANNON (CONTD)
She’s only seven and is already
starting to act like a teenager
What’s up

Shannon walks out of the forest and to her car

TERRI (VO)
I was just calling to see if you
wanted to hang out later today
Maybe go to that Fastball concert
tonight

SHANNON
Oh yeah that sounds like fun

TERRI (VO)
And we can get a few drinks
afterwards

SHANNON
Sounds like a plan

TERRI (VO)
Awesome Just give me a call
whenever you’re ready and I can
come pick you up I’m bringing
Erica along if that’s alright

SHANNON
Yeah sure Girl’s night

Shannon steps inside her car

TERRI (VO)
Great I’ll see you later Bye

SHANNON
Bye

Shannon hangs up and starts up her car The car pulls out
onto the road

INT CAR - DAY

Shannon turns on the radio Nothing but commercials and
morning talk shows emit from the radio She puts on a CD and
country folk music emits from the speakers

EXT CAR - DAY

The music continues
The car continues traveling through the country Pine trees
tower overhead

The car passes by a vast lake Ducks fly over the surface of
the water

Deer slowly walk to the edge of the lake and begin to drink
from it

Reflections of pine trees and mountain glide over the
windshield of Shannon’s car and disappear as she pulls out
onto the highway

The car travels towards a large neighborhood

EXT NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
The car heads for a house Two police cars and an ambulance

sit in front of it the siren lights flash off the front of
the house

EXT HOUSE - DAY

Shannon pulls her car into the driveway and quickly gets out
A POLICE OFFICER stops her

POLICE OFFICER
I’m sorry you can’t come through
here—

SHANNON
No I live here Ashley

ASHLEY (0S)
Mom

ASHLEY BROOKE small and thin still in her pajamas runs
over to Shannon She squeezes tightly to her mom

SHANNON
Are you okay What happened

Shannon picks up Ashley and holds her

ASHLEY
Dad wouldn’t wake up

The police officer walks up to Shannon He rubs his eyes

POLICE OFFICER
Mrs BrookeIt’s your husband
Shannon tries to speak but barely anything comes out She
turns away from the officer and begins to cry

Shannon falls to her knees and squeezes Ashley tightly who
begins to cry also

Behind them paramedics push a stretcher out of the front
door with a body beneath a white sheet

The police cars begin to disappear The ambulance dissolves
into nothing and the police officers paramedics and
neighbors disappear with the vehicles

Shannon remains on her knees but instead of crying she hugs
Ashley

EXT HOUSE - DAY
SUPER Five Months Later

A backpack sits on Ashley’s back A school bus pulls up in
front of the house

SHANNON
I love you

ASHLEY
I love you too

SHANNON
Have fun at your last day of
school

ASHLEY
Okay

Ashley pulls away from Shannon’s hug and waves to her as she
runs to the bus

Shannon stands up and watches Ashley get on the bus She
waves as the bus leaves
EXT COFFEE SHOP - DAY

It’s a small corner coffee shop A few empty tables sit
outside

Shannon and TERRI COHEN with an athletically built body
and short hair that reaches halfway past her neck walk over
to a table and sit
TERRI

-And the bastard sat next to me
with two drinks in his hands and
was like

(Deep man voice)
“Hey how you doin’”

(Normal voice)
And I just stared at him

SHANNON
You stared at him

TERRI
Didn’t say a word

SHANNON
Then what did you do

TERRI
I told the bartender to cancel my
order took both the drinks from
his hands and went and sat back
down with Erica

Shannon laughs

SHANNON
No way

TERRI
Seriously men are so

Shannon’s laugh fades away Terri trails off and takes a sip
from her coffee

TERRI
Except for Tom He was a great guy
You were lucky

SHANNON
YeahHe was

TERRI
Once again Shannon I am so sorry
I didn’t call much after what
happened I’m just not well with
dealing with stuff like that

SHANNON
It’s fine I completely understand
TERRI
I kept on staring at the phone
every day and I just really wanted
to call but I never knew what to
say and I just end up making things
awkward any way

SHANNON
Terri it’s fine Everything is
okay I mean I still have cards
from people that I haven’t read
yet

TERRI
How’s Ashley doing

SHANNON
She’s doing fine She doesn’t seem
to be as bothered about it now I’m
a bit worried that she doesn’t seem
phased by it that much anymore

TERRI
You don’t need to worry She’s a
great girl you know that

SHANNON
Of course I do she’s my daughter

They chuckle

TERRI
He was so young though It’s hard
to think that stuff like that
happens in your thirties

SHANNON
His family has had a line of heart
attacks He’s had two before in
less than two years I guess it’s
reasonable that there could have
been worse ones to follow

TERRI
That’s still unbelievable

SHANNON
It kinds of makes you wonder how
precious life is huh

TERRI
You got that fucking right

She holds up her coffee cup
TERRI
To life

Shannon can’t help but smile She lifts up her cup

SHANNON
(Unenthusiastically)
To life

They cling coffee cups and take a drink

TERRI
Oh hey okay so the reason I
wanted to hang out today was well
to spend time with you and all but
also

She pulls out a pamphlet from her bag and slides it across
the table

TERRI
This

Shannon picks it up

SHANNON
What is it

TERRI
It’s a brochure about hiking the
Appalachian Trail

Shannon is dumbfounded

SHANNON
You’re serious

Terri nods excitingly
SHANNON
You want to hike on the Appalachian

Trail

TERRI
And I want you to come with me

SHANNON
All of it

TERRI
As much as our hearts desire

SHANNON
I don’t know what to say
TERRI
Come on it’1ll be fun We both love
the outdoors and the wilderness
You always strive to find the best
views youre not afraid of heights
or travelling on dangerous grounds
it’ll be awesome

Shannon looks through the pamphlet

TERRI
The stuff in there is nothing like
what you’ll see if you actually
went there Tens of thousands of
people walk it every season so it
must be good

SHANNON
And risk our lives by facing
dehydration freezing nights
possible bear attacks poisonous
snakes poison ivy breaking a
bone falling from cliffs catching
diseases and possibly getting
lost not to mention over a hundred
other hazards

TERRI
Well sure

Shannon sets the pamphlet down and thinks for a moment

SHANNON
Have you walked it

TERRI
No which will make it even more
adventurous for the both of us
Come on It’1ll be so much fun

Shannon looks down at the pamphlet

SHANNON
What about Ashley

TERRI
Send her to your mom’s place Just
think about itLeave all your
problems behind for a while and
come hike on this trail with me

SHANNON
I don’t know It’s kind of early
after what happened
TERRI
It’s early but I want you to keep
away from the fact that he’s gone
This will help Think of it as
therapy

SHANNON
I guessBut still

TERRI
I’ve been planning it for a few
months now I have lists and
everything we need It’ll be fun
You and me in the wilderness
Ashley will be with your mom you
can take off work—I’m sure they’1l
understand if you say you need a
vacation because of what
happened

Shannon bites her lower lip

SHANNON
When do you plan on leaving

TERRI
Youre coming Oh my God awesome
I swear you won’t regret it I’ve
already researched as much as
possible and I’1l print out stuff
for you to look over

SHANNON
That sounds great but when do we
leave

TERRI

Well go shopping this weekend for
everything we need and I was
planning on leaving in about a
month or so
Shannon nods She smiles and holds up her coffee cup

SHANNON
To the AT

Terri holds her cup up

TERRI
Now that’s the spirit To the AT

They cling coffee cups

INT AIRPORT - DAY

TERRI
Sorry Diane but this is supposed

SHANNON

EXT TAXI — DAY

A plane flies over head towards the airport the engines

scream

A taxi drives away from the airport

INT TAXI - DAY

Terri and Shannon sit in the back Shannon flips
dozens of papers printed off the Internet

TERRI
This is going to be a real blast
We arrive in Springer Mountain
spend the night in a hotel and
wake up early and begin our trip
along the Appalachian Trail

The TAXI DRIVER looks in the rearview mirror

TAXI DRIVER
You’re hiking the trail

TERRI
Yeah Have you been on it

through

TAXI DRIVER
Nah but I’ve driven a lot of
people to Springer Mountain so they
could hike it Are you going to do
the whole thing

TERRI
As much as we want

TAXI DRIVER
Earl Shaffer He was the first
person to hike the entire trail in
one trip I’ve known many people
who try also but they end up
dropping out I drove this one guy
there he lasted about a week His
wife was so angry because he spent
all that money on equipment so she
forced him to go on it again and I
was his driver again

Shannon looks at one of the pages she’s holding

SHANNON
(From the paper)
What are we going to do about our
bags and stuff Like our food

TERRI
What about it

SHANNON
Bears It says that bears usually
sniff around at night and it’s one
of the causes for bear attacks

TERRI
We tie our food back to a rope and
swing it over a branch high up in
the trees

SHANNON
(Reading)
Apparently American Black Bears
are able to climb up trees and get
to food tied in trees

TERRI
So well tie it to the end of the
branch A small branch Their
weight will probably cause it to
break and it’1ll run off scared

SHANNON
Yeah and we’ll have to clean up
the mess

TERRI

Just don’t worry about a thing
I’ve researched everything we
needed to know—

SHANNON
(Questionable)
Everything

TERRI
Trust me I’ve hiked before in
other places it won’t be much
different here

Shannon smiles and looks out the window at the open country

INT HOTEL - ROOM - DAY

The door opens and Terri and Shannon struggle to walk in with
their large hiking bags on their back

Terri faces away from one of the beds and falls backwards
onto the bed and lays on her bags

TERRI
Oh yeah that’s much better

Shannon does the same

SHANNON
Oh my God you’re right

Both of them are out of breath Shannon struggles to sit up
She moves herself across the bed towards the phone on the
desk

TERRI
How about we hit the bar before
tomorrow One last drink

SHANNON
Let me call my mom first

She types in a number as Terri stands up and walks into the
bathroom with a change of clothes

SHANNON
(Into phone)

DIANE (VO)
Oh great Glad you got there

SHANNON

DIANE (VO)

me

SHANNON

talk to Ashley

DIANE (VO)
Yeah one second

A brief moment of silence through the phone then Ashley
crackles through

Background rock music the sound of a pool stick hitting a
pool ball people walk around with beers in their hands

Terri and Shannon sit at a two-person table each with a beer
in front of them

SHANNON
So why didn’t Erica come on this
trip too Doesn’t she like this
kind of stuff also

TERRI
She does but nothing was happening
between us I mean there was a
moment here and there but things
just faded away

SHANNON
You two finally broke up

TERRI
Yeah we both figured out that
nothing was happening so we decided
to move on

SHANNON
That sucks I’m sorry

TERRI
Oh it’s fine Just another reason
why I’m taking this hike To take
some weight off my shoulders

SHANNON
Except that’s not possible with
those thousand-pound backpacks on
our shoulders

TERRI
Oh Jesus those are going to be a
pain in the ass

SHANNON

And you know what else is
TERRI

What
SHANNON

The fact that I think those two
guys over there might be checking
us out

Terri looks over and sees two men staring at them She looks
back at Shannon tries to hold in her laughing but she can’t
help it

She bursts out laughing and Shannon snorts our her laugh

INT HOSPITAL - ROOM - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

The sound of a heart monitor beeping echoes through the
silent room

Shannon sleeps in a chair next to a hospital bed her head
resting on the bed In the bed is TOM BROOKE buzzed
head beard his face already beginning to wrinkle

Tom’s eyes slowly open He looks around the room and grasps
his surroundings Tom takes in a deep breath and looks at
Shannon

He lifts his hand up and softly caresses her hair She slowly
wakes up and sees Tom awake She smiles

Tom smiles back For a moment they stare at each other with
the heart monitor beeping in the background

TOM
Where’s Ashley
SHANNON
She’s at my sister’s house
TOM
Helen
SHANNON
No Rachel Helen moved remember
TOM
Oh rightI guess I forgot because

of
(He checks himself)
--whatever happened to me

SHANNON
You had a heart attack

Tom looks at her for a second and then sighs and rests his
head on his pillow Shannon sits up

SHANNON
Tom this is your second one in two
years—
TOM
One and a half
SHANNON
Yeah and I’m getting really

worried

Tom holds Shannon’s hand

TOM
There’s nothing to be afraid of
Shannon

SHANNON

I don’t know what to do
TOM
Hey if it’s my time to go then
let it be but I’m still here
okay

SHANNON
But what’s going to happen if the
next one is worse

TOM
Like I said let it be These
things happen and for my case
it’s going to happen a lot It runs
in my family

SHANNON
I know but—

TOM
You don’t know when they’re going
to happen No medicine or treatment
will keep them from coming

A tear rolls down Shannon’s cheek

SHANNON
But what am I going to do with
Ashley

TOM

Just take care of her protect her
That’s what mothers do The father
is there to protect the family as a

whole

SHANNON
But what if something happens to
me

INT HOTEL - ROOM - DAY
Terri shakes Shannon awake

TERRI
Wake up Wake up wake up wake up

Shannon groans

TERRI
Come on Let’s hit the trail

EXT TRAIL — DAY
BEGIN MONTAGE

Terri and Shannon walk the trail both with walking sticks
Shannon looks up at the large trees that seem to bend over
them and cover up most of the sky

Other hikers trail behind them or pass them

They walk up to a fallen log and Terri tries her best to get
over She throws one leg over and the tries her best to get
the other one over

Terri falls to the ground landing on her backpack The two
laugh and Terri takes her backpack off She stands up and
helps Shannon over

Shannon ends up falling also

The two walk over to a cliff exhausted They stare at the
view of the mountains

They continue to walk the trail Their conversation is
inaudible Shannon whacks the foliage with her walking stick
as they walk along the side of the trail

A bird flies onto a tree branch and watches Terri and Shannon
walk further down the trail

END MONTAGE

EXT TRAIL —- LATER

The sun sets and the sky turns a golden yellow with multiple
layers of reds pinks and purples

Terri and Shannon set up their tent a few yards away from the
trail

SHANNON
How far do you think we walked
today

TERRI

Who knows I don’t really like to
think about that stuff I like to
make it a surprise

Shannon wraps one corner of the tent around a stake

TERRI
Did you know that there’s not a
single map of the Appalachian Trail
that has every single small town or
camp post and whatnot labeled on
it

SHANNON
Oh yeah

TERRI
Yeah It’s kind of hard when you
have a 2174-mile long trail not
to mention the distance changes
every time that stretches through
fourteen states

SHANNON
Yeah well it’s hard to travel
even a mile of the trail with all
this crap on our backs

TERRI
You got that right The sleep
tonight is going to be nice

EXT TENT - NIGHT

It’s very dark Barely any light can squeeze through the
trees Crickets chirp and other various animal noises echo
through the vast area of woods

Another noise emits from inside the tent It’s a low noise
like growling Or more like snoring

INT TENT - NIGHT

Shannon opens her eyes and turns over only to come face to
face with Terri who the snoring is coming from

She takes her arm out of her sleeping bag and plugs Terri’s
nose A few seconds go by and Terri begins to cough She
swats at Shannon’s hand and turns over

TERRI
(Mumbled)
-SOrry

Shannon smiles A branch outside snaps The crickets go
quiet Shannon’s smile fades quickly

She sits up and stares at the side of the tent Another
crack this time on the other side of the tent near Terri

Leaves rustle and something brushes up against the side of
the tent

Shannon covers her mouth Whatever’s outside gets off the
tent and everything goes quiet again

Shannon shakes Terri

SHANNON
(Whispered)
Terri Terri wake up

Terri groans

SHANNON
(Whispered)
No I’m serious I think
something’s outside our tent

TERRI
It’s just the wind

SHANNON
Oh shut up we both know it’s not

EXT TENT - NIGHT

The zipper slowly moves upward It’s very loud in the silence
and it stops midway

SHANNON (0S)
Sh Be quieter

The zipper runs up this time more slowly Terri crawls out
of the tent with a flashlight She turns it on

Shannon follows with a flashlight also She turns hers on and
waves it across the trees and ground

The two spend time looking around the tent and in the woods
Terri sighs

TERRI
There’s nothing here

SHANNON
Something rubbed up against the
tent

TERRI
Well whatever it was it’s gone

SHANNON
What if it was a bear

TERRI
Well it knows we’re here now Good
going

They huddle together and walk towards the trail their
flashlights pointed straight in front of them

A branch cracks above them and before they can look up a
Black Bear falls to the ground with the branch

hannon and Terri scream and jump back Shannon falls over
till screaming and Terri tries to help her up The Black
ear scrambles to its feet and runs off

wnn

At the end of the broken branch is a large bag of food Terri
begins to crack up

SHANNON
Oh my God

TERRI
Holy shit That scared the shit out
of me

Terri cracks up some more

TERRI

You should have seen your face
SHANNON

I’m sure it looked a lot like

yours
Shannon shines her light on the bag of food
SHANNON
Well you were right about the
branches breaking
TERRI
See I told you I have everything

planned out

SHANNON
Jesus I almost had a heart attack

Terri laughs as she helps Shannon up

TERRI
Come on let’s get back to bed

SHANNON
What about the food

TERRI
Just stick it under the tent or
something If a bear tries to get
under there we’ll bash its fucking
head in

EXT TENT — DAY

The tent collapses as Terri and Shannon undo the stakes and
pull out the poles Terri folds the tent up and ties the
poles together

Shannon gathers her things together and opens up the food
bag

SHANNON
What’s for breakfast

TERRI
I put some trail mix in there and
some apples for the first day

SHANNON
Whatever sounds good to me

She pulls out the trial mix and two apples

TERRI
I still can’t help but laugh about
last night

SHANNON
Yeah well we’re lucky that bear
didn’t get our food

TERRI
Oh lighten up It’s nature You
never know what to expect

SHANNON
Youre damn right Poison ivy
ticks spiders snakes bears
dehydration broken bones

Shannon tries to get her backpack on She struggles and falls
over Terri laughs

BECKY TURNER very fit with a lot of muscle spiked
hair in nothing but a sports bra and pants walks through
the foliage to the two

Behind Becky is JONAS HERRING whose very fit body is
seen under his long sleeve shirt shorts and short spiked
hair

Like girlfriends and stuff Or
considering you’re case Shannon a
husband or something like that

Shannon looks at her for a moment then resumes looking at
clothes

SHANNON
Something like that

Becky frowns looks at Terri and forces a smile

Shannon walks over to a very large map of the Appalachian
trail that hangs on the wall She tilts her head and looks at
it

Jonas walks over to her He looks at her then at the map
and tilts his head also

JONAS
It’s a big map

SHANNON
Where are we

Jonas points at the bottom of the map

JONAS
Right there

SHANNON
Are you serious

JONAS
Yeah

SHANNON
Weve been walking for six days and
that’s how far we’ve gotten

JONAS
It’s a 2170-mile long trail what
we traveled is like half a
centimeteror something

Jonas pulls out his soda and opens it up

JONAS
God it’s been ages since I’ve had
one of these

He walks off to look at clothes Shannon continues to stare
at the map

EXT STORE - DAY

Terri and Becky walk out of the store and sit down on a
bench

BECKY
Did I say something wrong in there
Shannon seemed kind of weird

TERRI
Try not to mention anything about
husbands or fathers or anything

Becky opens her mouth to say something but stops and nods

BECKY
Alright

They sit there for a moment Terri looks around the town and
watches people walk by

TERRI
I’m really glad you guys let us
come along with you

BECKY
It’s no problem Some times it’s
better to walk the trail with more
people

TERRI
Yeah I love being on outdoor trips
with Shannon We’ve been friends
for probably nine years I love her
to death

BECKY
Same with Jonas and me He’s such a
crazy guy and he’s really fit I
always offer him the opportunity to
hike the AT and he always comes
I’m glad I’m with him because we
always meet crazy people on the
trail

TERRI
I’ve read that in a book about this
trail I think it was called a Walk
in the Woods or something

BECKY
I heard from people who walk the
trail that the author exaggerates a
lot of stuff in that book that
people aren’t like how the people
in the book are on the trail

TERRI
Which is why I’m glad we ran into
each other We just clicked—

Becky quickly moves in and kisses Terri Becky stops and
pulls back She touches her lips

BECKY
I’m sorry

Terri moves in and they kiss again this time more
passionately
INT STORE - DAY

Shannon stands at the counter and purchases a snack and a
bottled water Jonas stands next to her

JONAS
Oh oh look

Shannon looks over and sees Terri and Becky kissing She lets
out a little gasp

Reco looks over and sees the two kissing also He narrows
his eyes a bit

JONAS
Aw that’s really cute

Reco looks at Jonas He clears his throat

RECO

Shannon searches through a fanny-pack around her waist

conversations

A HIKER passes by them walking in the opposite directions

She turns the lantern off

INT TENT — DAY
Terri snores as she faces away from Shannon Shannon’s eyes
slowly flicker open She sits up and sees Terri snoring and
rolls her eyes

She crawls towards the door of the tent and unzips it

EXT TENT — DAY
She stops as she unzips the tent door and stares at the
ground A dark thick liquid puddles up in front of her She
dips her finger in it
Red stains the tip of her finger It’s blood
She follows the trail of blood towards another puddle this
one larger than the one in front of her tent Drops of blood
splash into the puddle
Shannon looks up She gasps and covers her mouth
SHANNON

Oh my God

A beaver hangs from a tree branch by its tail The stomach as
been ripped open and intestines hang out The throat as been
slit blood drips from it Flies swarm around the carcass

BECKY
Jesus Christ

SHANNON
Where’s Jonas

TERRI
Did he do this

BECKY

Jdonas God damn it what the
fuck
BECKY

Hey Look Jonas would not do
something like this He’s against
the killing of animals

TERRI

this

BECKY

he’s missing and that beaver is the
least of my problems If something
happened to him I want to find him
right away We’ll go to the next
town and try to find him and see if
anyone’s seen him

She looks at their tent

at their tent Blood soaks into the front of it

The sky is a bright blue Only a few clouds fill up the sky
Birds fly overhead

SHANNON
Oh yeah like really

waiting until a crisp fall day

EXT TRAIL —- LATER

sky The clouds are dark and gray and threaten to rain

BECKY
The next town isn’t for the next
five miles so let’s keep walking

EXT TRAIL —- LATER

The sky is even darker but only because it’s almost evening
time

BECKY (0S)
Jonas

TERRI (0S)

EXT TRAIL - NIGHT

A lot of lightning Roaring thunder The trees bend far in
the strong wind The trail gets muddy as rain pours out of
the sky

The three run across the trail towards a shelter

BECKY
In there Hurry

INT SHELTER - NIGHT

The three run inside soaking wet They quickly drop their
stuff on the floor

A man sits in the corner his face unseen He stands up gets
his backpack on He startles Shannon and she screams The man
walks out of the shelter and into the rain

TERRI
Fucking weirdo

BECKY
I guess the rain doesn’t bother
him huh

Becky pulls out a lantern and sets it on the floor She turns
it on Shannon pulls hers out also and turns it on

TERRI
God it’s fucking freezing

SHANNON
Here

Shannon hands Terri on of her long sleeved shirts Terri
quickly puts it on Becky and Shannon put on sweat shirts
also

Terri walks over to an upside down tuna can suspended by a
short nylon cord She taps it

TERRI
What’s this

BECKY
It’s a mouse trapeze

TERRI
Come again

BECKY
You hang your food bags to keep the
rodents from getting them

Terri stares at it and taps it again
TERRI

It’s nice to know I might have rats
crawling all over me while I sleep

BECKY
Yep Especially when it’s raining
like this

TERRI

Oh that’s real encouraging
Shannon walks over to the opening of the shelter

SHANNON
God it’s raining buckets I hope
Jonas is alright

BECKY
He better be I’m going to kick his
ass when we find him He knows not
to run off like this

SHANNON
Do you think he’s hurt

BECKY
I don’t try and think about that

INT SHELTER - LATER

Terri sleeps and again snores Becky and Shannon lay on
their sleeping bags It continues to poor down rain outside

SHANNON
So how did you and Jonas meet

BECKY
In college at The University of
North Texas Great school with a
great music program theater
program they had weekend camping
trips it was awesome

SHANNON
My sister went there She said it
was awesome And the townNot so
much

BECKY
Oh Denton Fucking boring The
only time it might be interesting
if there were murders circling the
city or if some I don’t know sci-
fi creature came from space and
started terrorizing the people

Shannon laughs

BECKY
Anyway we met on a kayaking trip
during one of the weekend camping
deals He was standing next to me
when this douche was hitting on me
and I kept on telling him to go
away After I told the guy to fuck
off five hundred times Jonas was
like “Dude if she doesn’t want
you then leave her alone I’m gay
and even I wouldn’t want to fuck
you”

SHANNON
No way

BECKY
Yeah But that was before Jonas
found out I was lesbian

SHANNON
It seems like you two get along
really well

BECKY
Yeah we became friends instantly
I’ve never made a friend that fast
in my life To tell you the truth
I’m really a shy person

SHANNON
You didn’t seem shy when we first
met

BECKY

Because Jonas was with me He’s a
crazy guy and is always nice enough
to walk up to people and say “Hi”
Which influences me to do the same
thing

Shannon nods

SHANNON
So do you guys ever receive
anycrap I guess about
yoursexuality Sorry if that’s
kind of awkward or whatever

BECKY
Oh no it’s completely fine Um
kind of sort of people don’t
throw things at us or anything if
that’s what you mean

Shannon laughs

SHANNON
No of course not

BECKY
Jonas has had it a lot harder than
me Kids would make fun of him
beat him up When he was sixteen
his parents found out he was gay
and they kicked him out of the
house He’d stay with friends in
their sheds or in their basements
or backyards until their parents
found out he was there Then they’d
tell him he couldn’t stay
Fortunately he was friends with
this kid who had hippies for
parents They thought it was
fantastic and so they became his
parents

Shannon snorts and Becky laughs

BECKY

Seriously I’m so glad he didn’t
become one of them Hippies are so
annoying but it was great for him
They paid for almost everything
They accepted him immediately fed
him practically made him their
child

Becky sighs and looks out into the rainy woods

BECKY
Jesus I really hope he’s okay

SHANNON
He told me he’s hiked at a lot of
places so he knows a lot about
survival

(MORE )

SHANNON (CONTD)
I’m sure he’s fine don’t let it
keep you up We need to sleep

Shannon takes a gulp of water from her water bottle Thunder
rumbles through the sky

BECKY
Terri told me not to mention this
and you don’t have to talk about it
if you don’t want to but what
happened to your husband

Shannon stops drinking her water She sets the bottle down

INT HOSPITAL - ROOM - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

A tear rolls down Shannon’s cheek

SHANNON
But what am I going to do with
Ashley

TOM

Just take care of her protect her
That’s what mothers do The father
is there to protect the family as a

whole

SHANNON
But what if something happens to
me

Tom holds on to Shannon’s hand

INT SHELTER - NIGHT

Shannon fumbles with her water bottle She opens her mouth to
speak when there’s a loud bang on one of the walls

Shannon and Becky turn their heads to the back wall

BECKY
What was that

Another bang The two jump at it Terri groans as she wakes
up

There’s another loud bang One of the bungee cords from the
mouse trapeze falls off its hook The tuna can falls to the
floor with a loud clatter

TERRI
What’s going on

Becky and Shannon stand up It becomes silent

A loud scratching comes from the back wall It begins to move
towards the side that Becky and Shannon are on There’s
another loud bang on the roof of the shelter

BECKY
God damn it Jonas if that’s you
I’m kicking your ass

The scratching moves onto the side that Becky and Shannon are
on Shannon walks over to the opening of the shelter when the
scratching stops

Shannon looks around the opening towards the side that was
being scratched on Nobody’s there She steps back into the
shelter

SHANNON
There’s nobody there

Shannon walks over to Terri’s side and checks the outside of
the shelter Nobody’s there either

She looks back at Becky and shakes her head
Becky shoves her boots on and walks out of the shelter on her
side Shannon watches her disappear behind the shelter She

looks back on her side

She watches Becky appear from behind the shelter Becky runs
back inside the shelter

BECKY
Nothing there I guess it was a
tree branch or something
Shannon turns and watches Becky take her shoes off
Suddenly a man jumps down from the roof of the shelter He
throws a black bag over Shannon’s head and pulls her out of
the shelter
BECKY
Shannon

EXT TRAIL - NIGHT

The man drags Shannon along the muddy trail She kicks and
screams but they are only muffled by the bag

Becky runs out of the shelter only to have another man
hiding behind her side of the shelter smash her across the
face with a large bulky tree branch

Blood sprays from Becky’s mouth as she falls to the ground
unconscious The man drops the branch and quickly grabs her
body and pulls her into the woods away from the shelter

Shannon continues to kick and scream as the man pulls her by
her wrists

Terri runs up from behind the man with the large branch that
the other man had

She swings the branch at the man and knocks him to the
ground Terri continues to hit the man with the branch as
Shannon tears the bag off of her head

The other man runs over and tackles Terri to the ground The
branch flies from her hands Shannon jumps to her feet and
runs down the trail the opposite way

TERRI
Shannon Run

The other man gets off the ground and puts the black bag over
her head

Shannon looks behind her and sees the black bag cover Terri’s
head

SHANNON
Oh my God

She looks behind her again and sees the first man drag Terri
away while the man who tackled Terri runs after Shannon

Shannon screams and tries to run faster The first man shouts
something and the man that chases Shannon slows to a stop He
watches her run and runs back over to the other man

She continues to run down the trail when she slips on a mud
puddle and falls face first into the muddy trail She
attempts to get up but her feet slide on the trail

She finally grasps ground and gets on her feet again
Shannon runs over to a tree and quickly climbs it She climbs
onto a large branch and sits against the tree while she sits

on the branch

She begins to cry Lightning flashes off of her and thunder
rolls through the woods

EXT SHELTER - NIGHT

Becky’s tied up unconscious body sits in a wheelbarrow She
sways her head side to side

The two men carry Terri’s body towards the wheelbarrow The
black bag is still over her head and her hands are tied
behind her back her legs tied together

They drop her body on top of Becky Terri cries underneath
the black bag

EXT SMALL CABIN - NIGHT

One of the men pushes the wheelbarrow towards the cabin The
other follows behind them

They push the wheelbarrow up to the porch They grab Terri’s
body and carry her into the cabin A few moments later they
walk out and carry Becky’s body into the cabin

INT CABIN - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Terri’s body lays on the floor against the wall She squirms
on her stomach and continues to cry beneath the bag

Becky’s body is tossed next to Terri’s

The two men’s faces are finally revealed One of them is
Reco the store cashier

The other man pulls his hood off

EXT TRAIL - FLASHBACK DAY - DAY

A Hiker passes by Shannon and Jonas walking in the opposite
directions

HIKER
Hello

SHANNON JONAS

The hiker looks behind him as he passes the four

INT CABIN - BATHROOM - NIGHT

The man turns out to be the hiker from before FRANKIE
CHRISTY kind of chubby buzz cut a scar on his left

He sighs and looks at the two women

RECO
But everything happens for a
reason

FRANKIE

Frankie leaves the bathroom

FRANKIE
(Under his breath)
Bastard

Reco watches him leave and walks over to Terri She continues
to sob beneath the black bag

Reco caresses Terri’s face She gasps and moves her head
away but he continues to caress her face

EXT TRAIL - NIGHT

Shannon sits on the branch drenched with rain She brushes
her matted hair out of her face and her tears are mixed up
with the rain

She looks back down the trail and sees the shelter with the
lanterns still lit Nothing at the shelter moves

Suddenly lightning strikes a nearby tree Shannon screams
and loses her balance but quickly grabs onto the branch She
dangles from the tree

The tree the lightning struck begins to crack The wind
pushes it over towards Shannon She sees the tree fall
towards her and screams

The tree hits her and she slips from the branch She screams
as she falls to the ground but her screams come to an abrupt
stop when she hits the hard ground floor

The tree topples over her body and Shannon becomes hidden

EXT TRAIL - MOMENTS LATER

A beam of light shines on the trail Frankie walks out from
behind the shelter and walks down the trail He swings his
flashlight from side to side in the woods up in trees

The rain begins to die down Thunder rumbles through the
area Trees crackle as the wind blows them sideways

Frankie walks further down the trail He looks behind him at
the shelter then in front of him He shines his lights on
footsteps and begins to follow them

He stops at the fallen tree and shines his light on it The
tree lays on the trail almost halfway covering it The
footsteps end at the tree Shannon was at

He kicks at the fallen tree and then shines up at the tree
right at the spot where Shannon sat

FRANKIE
Where the hell are you

Frankie shines his light back on the fallen tree stares at
it for a second then continues on down the trail
INT HOSPITAL - ROOM - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

A tear rolls down Shannon’s cheek

SHANNON
But what am I going to do with
Ashley

TOM

Just take care of her protect her
That’s what mothers do The father

is there to protect the family as a
whole

SHANNON
But what if something happens to
me

Tom holds on to Shannon’s hand

TOM

SHANNON

TOM
If anything does I just want you
to fight your way to the finish
And I’1l be there right next to
you Don’t let anything get in the
way and I know you won’t let
anything get between you and
Ashley

Shannon squeezes Tom’s hand tighter

TOM
You just gotta fight

Shannon sniffs and she hugs Tom

EXT TRAIL — DAY

Dawn arrives as the sky slowly gets brighter The sky is
overcast and causes the woods to look gray A small fog clogs
up the vision There’s no more rain

The fallen tree sits on the trail It jumps and becomes
still It jumps again and a hand pokes through the branches
and leaves

The tree jumps once more and Shannon crawls out from beneath
it She struggles to get out and takes in a deep breath

Shannon coughs covered in mud and soaking wet with no shoes
on She crawls out of the tree and onto the trail She lays
on her back and coughs some more

She stares up at the sky The trees tower over her An eagle
lets out a loud cry and floats above her She rolls over onto
her stomach and struggles to her feet

Shannon begins to walk but stumbles side to side like a
drunken woman She collapses next to a tree and breaks down
crying

She sniffs and stands back up and stumbles down the trail

EXT SHELTER —- DAY

Shannon stumbles over to the trail and walks inside but
stops All the bags are missing The lanterns are gone the
floor is bare

Shannon stumbles backwards and loses her balance as she walks
off the edge

She falls on her back and yelps in pain She arches her back
and grits her teeth flips over onto her stomach Her arms
shake as she gets onto her hands and knees

Shannon looks next to her and sees wheelbarrow tracks She
follows them and the tracks lead her to the foliage next to
the shelter

She stops at the plants and looks onwards The tracks lead
her deep into the woods

EXT WOODS - DAY

Shannon stumbles through the foliage and between trees Bird
calls echo through the vast forestry Shannon shivers her
chin trembling

She stops and takes off her wet sweatshirt She wraps her
sweatshirt around her waist and continues to walk

Shannon comes upon a large hill and begins to carefully walk
down it She steps on sharp jagged rocks and gasps

She grabs her foot and gasps in pain Shannon looks down at
it Blood stains her hands and sock She takes deep breaths
and makes her way down the hill

She comes to the middle of the hill when she steps on loose
sticks and rocks They slip beneath her feet and she falls on
her side

Shannon begins to roll down the hill She screams and rolls
into a tree with a sickening crunch She falls past the tree
and tries to grab it

She keeps a grip on the tree but soon begins to slip Her
hands start to bleed from the bark that scratches up her
palms

Her hands slip from her grip and she slides down the hill
She reaches the bottom and rolls to a stop on her back

Shannon’s face is scratched and her body is bruised She
coughs her throat dry She rolls onto her stomach and throws

up

She gets onto her knees and wipes strings of slobber and
throw up from her mouth Shannon yelps and looks at her
finger

Her eyes grow wide when she sees her finger bent in a
different direction She calms down and takes deep breaths

Slowly she grabs her finger but retreats her other hand and
yelps She takes another deep breath and grabs her finger
again

Softly she counts to three with each deep breath and pops her
finger back into place

Shannon screams bloody murder Her screams echo through the
woods A flock of birds escape from a tree near her

Shannon cries as she holds onto her finger and doubles over
Tears flow from her eyes and drool drips from her mouth but
she could care less

She looks up at the sky

SHANNON

(Deep breaths)
Jesus ChristGod please let me

get out of here

She takes more deep breaths and slowly gets to her feet
Shannon looks at her finger and tries to bend it

She flinches in pain as she moves it but is able to bend it
all the way

Shannon looks over to the sound of flowing water She begins
to walk towards it

EXT RIVER — DAY

A large river flows quickly Sharp jagged rocks sit in the
middle of the river which cause deadly rapids

Shannon pushes her way through the trees and bushes until she
sees the water She rushes over to the river bank and falls
to her knees

She cups her hands and begins to gulp down water like there’s
no tomorrow Her hands shake as she drinks the water It
drips down her cheeks and chin

She stops and allows time for it to flow down her throat She
coughs then gags and tries to keep everything in She
shivers and turns away from the river

She throws up again this time mostly water so it’s clear

She takes deep breaths and turns back to the river and drinks
some more water

She finishes one last gulp and takes a breather Across from
her a baby moose and its mother walk up to the river bank
and start drinking

Shannon watches the two drink the water She coughs The
mother moose looks up and stares at Shannon while the baby
moose continues to drink

Becky Terri

Shannon walks down the river She stops when she sees smoke
rise up from behind the trees She looks through the trees
and sees a small cabin

She steps into the river and carefully begins to cross
Shannon reaches the middle of the river and almost loses her
balance

She stops to ground herself and then continues on

UNDERWATER

Shannon’s feet walk across smooth river rocks Her feet kick
the rocks and the river takes the rocks downstream

She steps on a pile of rocks and they move beneath her feet

THE RIVER

Shannon loses her footing and falls underwater She quickly
pops her head out of the water before rapids push her back
underwater

Shannon pushes herself up and she grabs onto a large rock
She is able to hold on and pulls herself up onto the rock
She takes a deep breath and steps back into the water

She makes it across to the other side of the river Shannon
walks a bit upstream and walks into the woods The cabin is
just in sight

EXT CABIN - DAY

Shannon runs out of the woods and into an open area She sees
the old small cabin Smoke rises out of the chimney

SHANNON
Hello

She walks towards the cabin but stops when she sees her
backpack along with Terri and Becky’s

SHANNON
Oh my God

The door opens Shannon quickly runs over to a pile of
chopped logs and hides behind it She looks around the pile
and sees Reco and Frankie walk over to an old pick up truck

Reco opens the driver side door and searches for something
Frankie rests on the hood of the truck and they have an
incomprehensible conversation

Reco pulls out a shotgun and slams the door shut Shannon
gasps and puts her back against the pile of logs

She slowly leans back over and watches them again

RECO

RECO

Frankie walks over to the pile of wood Shannon presses her
back up against the pile again

He picks up an axe on the side of the pile Shannon closes
her eyes and tries to stay calm

An axe comes down on one of the pieces of the wood Shannon
squeaks and covers her mouth

Frankie steps on the piece of wood and pulls the axe out of
it He raises the axe up again and slams it down on another
piece of wood right next to Shannon’s head

She falls to her side and covers her head and mouth

over the place

FRANKIE

Frankie shoves Reco back Reco tackles Frankie to the ground
and they start fighting and cursing Shannon scrambles to her
feet and runs over to the side of the cabin

She hides behind two trash cans and the wheelbarrow and
watches Reco and Frankie continue to fight

Frankie pushes Reco off of him

FRANKIE
Get the fuck off of me

Reco stands up and stares at Frankie

RECO
You better not fuck anything up

Frankie coughs and sits up Reco helps Frankie up and brushes
the dirt off of him

RECO
Now clean up that mess you made
Keep a look out for that girl

Reco walks away and Frankie brushes off the dirt on his
pants He walks over to the woodpile and begins to pick up
the wood

Shannon crawls away from the trash cans and wheelbarrow
towards the other side of the cabin She crawls under a
window Shannon stands up and presses herself against the
cabin wall

Reco pulls Terri’s body out of the bathroom He comes back
moments later and pulls Becky’s body out

Shannon looks back at Frankie and makes sure she’s hidden
She looks back inside and sees Reco walk into the bathroom

She moves away from the window as he looks outside He lifts
the toilet lid and unzips his pants Shannon quickly makes
her way to the other side of the cabin

She quickly moves around the corner just as Frankie grabs the
wheelbarrow He looks at where Shannon was standing takes
the wheelbarrow and pushes it to the woodpile

Shannon looks around the corner and watches him push the
wheelbarrow to the woodpile She moves down the side of the
cabin and stops at another window

Inside she sees Terri with the black bag still on her head
and Becky on the floor in the kitchen Becky’s face is
covered with dry blood

A white sheet sits on the table with a giant lump underneath
it

Reco appears as he walks into the kitchen Shannon hides
behind the wall of the cabin but slowly peeks through the
window

Frankie grabs her face again but Terri spits in his face

He wipes the spit off of his face and looks at it He slaps
her Shannon covers her mouth as she watches

Terri looks at him in disbelief Frankie slaps her again
this time harder Again he slaps her He continues to hit
her harder and harder his hand turning into a fist
Shannon’s eyes are wide her mouth still covered

a small table There are no keys on it She silently searches
through the drawers

Keys are nowhere to be found on the desk She walks over to
the kitchen counter and looks there but there’s nothing

Shannon walks over to a coat hanger next to the door Two
coats hang on the wall She checks the pockets of one coat
Nothing

She checks the pockets of the other coat She pulls out a
pocket knife and sticks it in her back pocket She looks out
the door at the truck

EXT CABIN - DAY

Shannon steps out onto the porch The wood creaks beneath her
feet She looks over at the woodpile where Frankie stacks the
wood up from the wheelbarrow

His back faces her and she runs to the truck She hides
behind it just in time as Frankie notices a piece of wood on
the ground

He walks over to it and faces at the truck He picks up the
wood and walks back over to the pile

Shannon quietly opens the truck door and checks the ignition
The keys aren’t there She pulls down the sun visor and the
keys drop onto the dashboard

but doesn’t turn them

She leaves the door open and checks for Frankie He continues
to stack the wood

She runs back to the porch

open and Shannon puts her index finger to her mouth

BECKY

Shannon presses her finger harder to her mouth Shannon picks
Becky up and begins to drag her towards the cabin entrance
EXT CABIN - DAY

Shannon drags her out onto the porch She drags her across
the ground and towards the bed of the pick up truck Becky

groans as Shannon tries to set her in the bed

Shannon looks over at the woodpile Frankie is gone She
looks around the area but can’t find him anywhere

She quickly walks to the porch and is about to walk into the
cabin when Frankie appears at the porch

FRANKIE
What do you think you’re doing

Shannon jumps at his voice when she sees him He begins to
run at her She jumps off the porch to the truck

Before Shannon can reach the truck door Frankie tackles her
and pins her down

TERRI

Reco runs out onto the porch and sees Frankie on top of
Shannon He curses to himself and runs inside

A moment later he runs out and grabs Shannon’s hands He
ties the rope around her wrists

grabs Becky

She tries to scream but is disoriented from the blow she
took to the head earlier

INT CABIN - KITCHEN - DAY

SHANNON
(Quietly)

RECO

RECO
Was that a beg to be kept alive
After you came in here to try and
save your stupid friends Why are
you begging for us not to kill you

shit in the first place Did you
always believe that you were
smarter than us Smarter than a
couple of guys who live in the
woods

FRANKIE
Also known as “rednecks”

RECO
Will you shut up

SHANNON
Why are you doing this

RECO
I’m actually curious to know what
your answer is Why do you think
were doing this

SHANNON
We didn’t do anything We are just
hiking the trail like everyone
else We’re on vacation like
everyone else

RECO
That doesn’t answer my question
Why do you think we’re doing this

SHANNON
Please just let us go I have a
daughter

RECO
(Mocking)
“Please I have a daughter”—Answer
the damn question
Shannon begins to cry

SHANNON
I don’t know I don’t know

Reco sighs

RECO
And I bet you’re wondering why we
chose you out of all the other
hikers out there too huh

Shannon continues to cry She turns away from him

RECO
Look at me when I talk to you

She doesn’t look at him He slams his fist on the wall right
next to her face She flinches

RECO
Look at me

She forces herself to look at him

RECO
Why am I doing this Why am I doing
this I saw those two fucking
dikes out in front of my store
exposing their homosexuality in
public They are full of sin by
making love with the same sex They
are killing unborn children by
being homosexuals

Shannon pulls out the pocket knife from her back pocket and
begins to slowly cut the rope

RECO
Their bodies are impure and are a
sin as a whole in the eyes of our
Lord Jesus Christ and our Father of
Heaven I am following the Lord’s
word and cleansing the world by
exterminating those who carry out
sin through homosexuality For
that they are going to the depths
of Hell where they will experience
pain and suffering for all
eternity

Terri begins to cry

TERRI
Oh God please don’t

RECO
The Lord has called for me to do
so and I will follow his word
SHANNON
That’s not true

RECO
Oh really Why not

Shannon sniffs and calms down

SHANNON
Who are the real sinners

RECO
What are you talking about

SHANNON
It’s not her fault that she falls
in love with the same sex It’s
nobody’s fault It’s how she was
born That’s how God made her

RECO
She is a mistake

SHANNON
Like hell she is you mother
fucker You were not called to kill
her or Becky If you kill her you
will go to Hell and experience pain
and suffering for all eternity
because it is an even bigger sin to
kill someone You are not
fulfilling God’s word you are
destroying it by killing an
innocent person

RECO
She is not innocent She is an
impure being who must be rid of
this world before she causes any
more sin I am going to save
everyone who is against
homosexuality some time and I am
going to save her the embarrassment
of the feeling of prejudice

SHANNON
There’s no prejudice this stuff is
in every single continent You
can’t stop it

RECO
I can with the Lord’s help
(To Terri and Becky)
(MORE)

sin

Reco sits Becky up by pulling on her hair She yelps He
pulls her head back by her hair and puts the knife to her
neck

SHANNON
Wait no

TERRI

Becky begins to cry Shannon begins to cut the rope around
her wrists furiously

TERRI
Please don’t do it

Terri looks away

RECO

Frankie kneels next to Terri and holds onto her head He
faces her head towards Becky and pulls her eyelids back so
she can see

TERRI
Stop let me go

SHANNON
Don’t do it Stop Just let her go

BECKY
No Please I don’t want to die

Reco digs the knife deep into her neck and slides it across
Her neck splits open and blood sprays out like a waterfall

Terri screams and Shannon watches eyes wide open Becky
gurgles on her blood Reco digs the knife deep into her neck
again and slices it open once more

Terri tries to look away but Frankie holds her head in
place

RECO
Don’t look away

Reco throws Becky’s dying body on Terri Blood sprays from
Becky’s neck onto Terri

Shannon finishes cutting the rope off of her hands She
breaks free and grabs a nearby coat hanger next to the cabin
entrance

She screams as she picks up the coat hanger and smashes it on
Reco’s head He falls to the ground and she smashes it on his
head again He becomes unconscious

Frankie runs over but Shannon smashes the coat hanger on
him too He stumbles back and falls to the ground

Shannon drops the coat hanger and pulls Becky’s body off of
Terri who cries as she watches Becky roll off of her Blood
begins to pool around the table

Shannon uses the pocket knife to cut the rope off of Terri’s
wrists She gets it cut off and Frankie gets to his feet He
grabs Shannon and pulls her back

She swipes the knife at him and cuts his arm open He screams
and retreats as he holds onto his arm Blood squirts from
between his fingers

Shannon stands up and Frankie looks up at her She slices at
his neck and cuts it open Blood begins to drip out

Terri unties her feet and crawls away She turns Becky over
She doesn’t move

TERRI
Oh God

Frankie stumbles back He holds onto his neck and then looks
at his hand It’s covered in blood

FRANKIE
You bitch

Frankie steps on Becky’s blood and slips He falls backwards
and lands on the table The legs break and the table tips
over The object beneath the white sheet falls to the floor

The sheet pulls off and Jonas’ body rolls out on the floor
onto his back

Shannon screams
His body is pale and bruised His neck has been sliced open
his penis and testicles have been cut off his eyes have been

pulled out of their sockets

SHANNON
Oh God

Frankie stumbles to get up but he slips on Becky’s blood
Shannon stares at Jonas’ body and covers her mouth

She runs over to Terri

Shannon pulls her back Terri tries to reach for her
TERRI
No
EXT CABIN - DAY
Shannon and Terri stumble out of the cabin

SHANNON
In the truck Hurry

Terri limps to the passenger side as Shannon climbs into the
driver seat She turns the keys in the ignition but the
truck refuses to turn on

Shannon continues to start the truck but fails They see
Frankie step out of the cabin his clothes soaked in blood

SHANNON
Start you piece of shit

Frankie runs up to the driver side Shannon locks the door as
he pounds on the window

FRANKIE
The truck is fucking under repairs

anywhere

Frankie smears his blood on the window

FRANKIE
Get out of the fucking truck

He winces in pain and touches his neck

FRANKIE
You bitch I can’t believe you cut
my fucking neck open

He goes to the bed of the pick up truck and pulls out a tool
box He pulls out a tire iron and walks back to the driver
side and begins to hit the window

Shannon and Terri scream

The window shatters and Frankie reaches inside the truck
Shannon pushes his face back He grabs her hair and pulls her
towards the window Shannon screams

She shoves her thumb into his eye He screams and retreats
from the truck Frankie closes his hurt eye and crawls back
through the window He unlocks and opens the door

Shannon kicks the door open and knocks him to the ground
She grabs the tire iron Frankie sits up and she smashes his
face with the tire iron Blood and teeth spray from his

mouth He falls to the ground and screams in pain

Shannon and Terri begin to run away from the cabin towards
the river

EXT WOODS - DAY

Shannon runs through the trees while Terri limps behind her
and slowly lags behind

SHANNON
Come on Run

TERRI
I can’t run fast enough Wait

Terri falls to the ground Dirt and leaves poof up into the
air Shannon looks behind her and sees Terri on the ground

EXT CABIN - DAY

Frankie sits up and picks up one of his teeth He squeezes
his hand around the tooth into a fist

EXT WOODS - DAY

Shannon runs over to Terri and tries to help her up but
Terri falls back on the ground

SHANNON
We have to keep moving We have
to—

Shannon looks back at the cabin and sees Frankie running
towards them with the axe in his hand

SHANNON
Oh my God Terri Get up

Shannon pulls Terri up to her feet and they start stumbling
towards the river

They’re only halfway through the woods when Frankie gets
ready to strike as he runs towards them Shannon looks back
and sees the axe above his head

Shannon pushes Terri down to the ground and dives out of the
way as he swings the axe down towards the ground

He faces Shannon and holds the axe above his head Shannon
moves out of the way as he brings the axe down to the ground
She stands up and tackles him

Terri stands up and stumbles out of the way as the two fight
on the ground Frankie gets on top and punches her in the
face Her lip splits open

Frankie stands Shannon up and pushes her into a tree

He walks over and pulls the axe out of the ground Terri runs
up and pushes him but she’s too weak to even move him a few
feet She falls to the ground

Terri pulls herself across the ground and cries Frankie
walks around her and dangles the axe above her

Shannon rests against the tree too tired to do anything She
watches on

SHANNON
Don’t do it Please

Terri continues her attempt to crawl away and pleads to
herself Frankie holds the axe over her

SHANNON
No

He brings the axe down on the back of her neck Blood sprays
on the axe and on her clothes She stops crawling He brings
the axe down again Her neck snaps she stops moving

Blood sprays on nearby trees and on the grass He brings it
down again and the axe completely decapitates her Blood
sprays on his face and he stumbles back

Terri’s body twitches Shannon watches on in horror Frankie
turns to her

Shannon gasps and stands up Her legs become shaky and she
falls forward She begins to crawl away on her hands and
knees

Frankie also tired and out of breath slowly walks after
her

Shannon nears the riverbank She begins to crawl over rocks
She looks at them as she crawls towards the water

Frankie walks closer to her and gets his axe ready He raises
it up but then Shannon turns around and throws rocks at him
They hit his stomach and chest and he backs away

FRANKIE
Stop

She continues to grabs rocks and throw them at him and he
tries to block them with his hands

She throws a large rock and it hits him in the face He drops
the axe and stumbles back screaming in agony He holds onto
his face and falls on his back

Shannon grabs a large flat rock and stands up She quickly
walks over to him and falls to her knees

Frankie takes his hands away from his face and sees her
holding the large flat rock above his face

FRANKIE
No

She brings the rock down on his face with a sickening crunch
His body jolts

She takes the rock up and he gurgles on his blood Blood
flows from his nose and eyes She smashes it on his face
again

His legs twitch violently and she hits him more times each
time with a harder blow Blood flings off the rock every time
she brings it over her head

His face becomes a mushy pulp of meat and blood

The grass turns red her pants turn red and blood sprays on
her face and clothes She slams the rock down on his face one
last time and keeps it there

Shannon quickly gets to her feet and tries to run towards the
river

EXT RIVER — DAY

She runs into the water and almost loses her balance as she
runs across

Shannon falls on her hands and knees but is able to keep
ground She stands up and takes another step She loses her
balance and falls

This time she can’t grab onto a rock The rapids pull her
downstream She hits numerous rocks and yelps at each blow
she takes from them

She falls down a small dip and submerges beneath the white
rapids Shannon comes up for a breath of air but immediately
goes back under

UNDERWATER

Shannon slams her back into a large rock which forces her to
scream underwater She takes a breath and begins to cough

THE RIVER

Shannon comes up out of the water and coughs as water spews
from her mouth

She takes in a deep breath before going under more rapids

Shannon pops out of the surface of the water one more time
She tries her best to swim towards the bank

She falls down another dip and hits a rock face first Her
head starts bleeding and her head falls backwards and her
eyes roll upwards

She floats down the river disoriented double-vision The
water becomes calm as she reaches smooth waters

EXT RIVER —- LATER

Shannon’s body lays on the bank of the calm river An eagle
flies above her and lets out a loud cry

Shannon moves her head to the side

TOM (VO)

Shannon wake up

She rolls over onto her back and her eyes slowly flicker
open

She touches the gash on her head and looks up at the overcast
sky

She sits up and stares at the river She takes a look at her
surroundings Her stomach gurlges and she gags Shannon rolls
onto her hands and knees and throws up

Shannon breathes deeply and clutches her stomach her face
contorted from pain She stands to her feet

She looks upstream and sees a person walking on the opposite
side of the river She waves her arms in the air

SHANNON
Hey Hey I need help over here

The person looks at her She stops waving her arms when she
realizes who it is
The person is Reco with the blood-covered axe in hand

SHANNON
Oh my God

She runs into the woods as Reco runs down the bank

EXT WOODS - DAY

Shannon stumbles through foliage and trips over logs and
branches

Shannon runs down the dirt road towards the house

EXT HOUSE - DAY

Shannon runs up to the front door She pounds her fist on it

SHANNON
Hello Is there anyone in there
Somebody help me Please

She runs over to a window and bangs on it

SHANNON
Hello

Shannon runs back to the front door and shoves her shoulder
into it The door won’t budge She continues to try and break
the door open but fails to do so

She looks back at the woods and sees Reco run out He looks
to his right at the stretch of dirt road and then at the
house

Shannon gasps and runs down the porch steps She runs around
the back of the house and up the porch steps of the back
door

She listens as the sounds of cars speeding down a highway

sees a car pass in the distance

SHANNON
Hey Hey over here Help

More cars pass through the trees

Somebody help me

She trips and falls again into some bushes Shannon lifts her
head up and sees Reco walking through the woods

She quickly rolls on her back and stays flat on the ground
She breathes heavily and tries to calm herself down

A snake begins to slither up her leg She doesn’t seem to
notice until the snake slides onto her chest She gasps and
tries to remain still

The snake slides up to her face She squirms and grabs the
snake and tosses away

Shannon scrambles to her feet and backs away from the snake
She turns around and begins to run

The head of an axe slides out from behind a tree catching
Shannon at the neck She flips over onto her back

Shannon attempts to breath but only coughs violently and
sputters Reco walks out from behind the tree and stares at
her Shannon stares back

RECO
I’m sorry are you unable to
breathe

He kicks her in her side She grabs her side and curls up in
the fetal position He kicks her again this time in her gut

She wheezes as she tries to breathe

him

He screams in her face

RECO
Survival of the fittest

He holds the axe up and slams it down on Shannon’s leg She
screams in pain as the blade digs deeps into her skin and
muscle

Reco jiggles the axe in her leg and causes the skin and
muscle to rip Blood gushes from her leg

Shannon grabs her leg and continues to scream

SHANNON

ready for another blow

RECO
Youre lucky I forgot my shotgun

A branch snaps and Reco looks up A baby Black Bear hangs
onto a branch above them It cries before the branch breaks
off the tree

The bear lands next to Shannon and Reco Shannon covers her
face and rolls away She yelps at her leg The bear rolls
into Reco and knocks him to the ground

The bear cries again and Reco jumps to his feet

RECO
God damn it

He kicks the bear It growls and cries louder He kicks it
again this time in the head Its cries echo through the
woods

RECO
Get the fuck out of here

The bear runs off It limps as it runs away
Reco picks up his axe and walks over to Shannon

RECO

(To himself)
Lord give me the strength to
spread and fulfill your word and to
exterminate those who sin by having
same sex marriages Please bless
this poor woman’s soul and please
watch over Frank

(To Shannon)
And I just want you to remember
everything happens for a reason

He holds the axe up above his head but stops when there’s a
loud growl and snarl behind him He brings the axe down and
looks behind him

A seven-foot tall female American Black Bear stands behind
Reco It stands up on its hind feet and roars at him

Reco’s eyes grow wide He holds up his axe but the bear
swipes its paw at him His body flies across the ground his
axe falls from his hands

He stands up as the bear charges at him The bear tackles him
and he screams as it begins to claw at his body and face

The claws rips at his face and four gashes split open Blood
sprays on the grass and plants The bear bites at his throat
and rips it open

Reco chokes on his blood

The bear picks him up with her paws and throws him across the
ground He spits out blood and rolls onto his back The bear
walks over and bites down at his stomach

His entrails spill out onto the ground The bear pulls the
intestines out with her paw then bites down on Reco’s head
Her teeth sink deep into his skull

She shakes her head and Reco’s neck snaps The bear drops his
head and begins to sniff his body

She rolls his body over onto his stomach She rolls him over
again back onto his back

Shannon struggles to stand up She uses a tree for support
but she falls as she puts weight on her injured leg

The bear turns to her She looks at it and lays down on her
stomach very still The bear begins to walk to her and begins
to sniff her

Shannon’s breathing becomes shaky as the bear continues to
sniff her It uses its nose to nudge her and she lets out a
small scream

The bear continues to nudge her sniffs her face and
finally backs away

The baby bear walks up to its mother and snuggles against
her and they turn and begin to walk away Shannon continues
to stay still until the bear’s footsteps are no longer heard

Shannon breathes hard and deeply her breathing very shaky
She sits up against the tree and wipes her forehead

Shannon watches the bear and cub leave and looks back at
Reco’s mutilated body She gags and turns away

Shannon tries to stand up again using the tree for support
She is able to keep her balance and she begins to limp
towards the highway

Police cars speed down the highway with their lights and
sirens on Shannon waves her arms towards them

SHANNON
Over here Hey

More patrol cars speed after the first one

SHANNON
Over here Please

She falls and yelps She tries to stand up but can’t Shannon
begins to cry as she stares at the highway The passing cars
seem so close She reaches out to them

SHANNON
PleaseOver here

She continues to cry

A moment later she gets on her hands and knees and begins to
crawl her way towards the highway

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

A car passes by the woods Shannon appears out from the
woods She crawls out next to the highway and collapses

A HITCHHIKER with hiking gear and a hiking backpack walks
backwards along the shoulder of a highway

He turns back around and sees Shannon on the side of the
road He walks up to her and notices her injuries

HITCHHIKER
Oh my God what happened

SHANNON

A car appears on the highway and nears the hitchhiker and
Shannon

HITCHHIKER
Wait there’s a car coming this

The hitchhiker walks out onto the middle of the road and
waves his arms in the air

The car begins to slow down

HITCHHIKER
I think they’re slowing down

The car pulls to the side of the road The hitchhiker runs
over to the driver side and talks to the driver of the car

Shannon stares up at the overcast sky The clouds begin to
dissipate and the sun shines down on Shannon She closes her
eyes

SUPER Three Days Later

A heart monitor beeps in the silent hospital room Shannon
lays in the hospital bed asleep

Ashley and Diane sit in a chair asleep Ashley sleeps in
Diane’s lap

Shannon’s clean and showered but her face is decorated with
bruises Her lip is stitched up her leg wrapped with
bandages her cuts cleaned

A shadow looms over Shannon and a hand touches her arm She
begins to wake up Tom’s face comes close to hers He kisses
her on the cheek

TOM
You did good She’s okay
Shannon smiles

TOM

Tom backs away Shannon turns over to see him but he’s gone
There’s nothing there but a large window

She looks back at the sleeping Ashley and smiles a little

She sits up and looks around the room and out the window It
rains and she has a great view of the Appalachian Mountains

She holds the bed comfort control and presses the up button
Her bed bends into a sitting position and she lays back

Shannon grabs a TV remote and turns the television on It’s
the news

INSERT Television screen
A NEWS ANCHOR sits at her desk and looks at the camera

NEWS ANCHOR
Good morning I’m Christen
Halloway Our top story this
morning police officials were
finally able to talk to the victim
of a quadruple homicide while she
was taking a vacation with three
other friends on the Appalachian
Trail 33-year-old Shannon Brooke
was kidnapped with three other
friends while hiking by two men who
were later identified as 30-year-
old Reco Newman and 29-year-old
Frankie Christy

Two pictures show up on the screen of Reco and Frankie

NEWS ANCHOR
Both the convicts were killed the
same day Shannon was found Christy
was killed near a small cabin the
two men lived in and Newman was
attacked and killed by an adult
American Black Bear Terri Cohen
Becky Turner and Jonas Herring
were also victims to the homicide
and unfortunately were killed

Three pictures show up of the three other victims
HOSPITAL ROOM

Shannon’s eyes water up

TV SCREEN

NEWS ANCHOR
Shannon had told officials that the
killings were hate crime-related
that the two men’s reason that they
killed the three hikers was because
they were homosexuals and that
they quote “were told to follow
the word of the Lord and
exterminate those who sinned
through homosexuality”

HOSPITAL ROOM

Shannon looks away from the TV and out the window Lightning
rips through the sky and thunder rumbles through the
mountains

TV SCREEN

NEWS ANCHOR (0S)
This event has sparked much
controversy around the country as
those who support gay rights
protest against those who deny the
rights of same sex marriages or
homosexuality altogether But this
isn’t the first time a hate crime
related to homosexuality has
occurred on the Appalachian Trail
Let us not forget the murders of
Julianne Williams and Lollie Winans
who were victims of a double
homicide in 1996 where authorities
considered anti-lesbian prejudice
as a possible motive for the brutal
attack

BACK TO SCENE

The news anchor’s voice echoes as she continues her story
while Shannon stares out the window

Lightning flashes again Shannon closes her eyes

FADE OUT
Thunder rumbles through the blackness
