SUPER MAIN TITLES

Over a grimy concrete wall creeping by We emerge

EXT RUNOFF TUNNEL - EARLY MORNING

A gaping hole in the concrete side of a freeway On the
embankment beside the hole BRENDAN FRYE squats

hunched His dark eyes behind thin glasses watch the
shallow stream of water which flows into the tunnel

THE WATER
not more than six inches deep Just beneath the surface
young womans pale blue arm in gaudy bracelets bats

the edge of her body like a docked boat A pebble plinks
into the water beside it1

TITLE CARD OVER BLACK 2 DAYS PREVIOUS
INT LOCKER CAGE - DAY

A single locker That same arm bracelets and all slips
note through the slats then leaves quickly

As the cage empties a lone figure slumps to the locker
Opens it The note falls to his feet

The figure is Brendan He unfolds the note (folded ina
triangle) -- 1230 PICO and ALEXANDER

A STREET SIGN
Pico and Alexander2

A WRIST WATCH
1243 Brendan looks up from the watch
EXT STREET CORNER - DAY

He sits on the curb of a wide suburban street eats
lunch

from a brown bag and watches a phone booth on the
corner He

shows no surprise when it begins to ring Brendan goes
to

the phone and puts the receiver to his ear Silence for
a

moment then a thin female voice from the phone

Originally Dode was later revealed to have been hiding
above the tunnel

The street names were changed in production to match
existing streets (we couldnt
afford to create custom street signs)

VOICE
(over phone)

BRENDAN

EMILY
(weakly)

BRENDAN
Slow down now what

EMILY
You gotta help me Brendan I think tug-
On

With a sharp breath the line clicks dead just as a black
mustang roars by Brendan drops the receiver and spins

out

of the booth

There another pay phone up the hill -- empty

Brendan turns to the black mustang far down the street
A

mans hand drops a cigarette butt from the driver side

window1

The mustang turns the corner gone

Brendan walks after it finds the cigarette butt on the

street Still smoking

A pale blue arrow is printed on the filter

In the distance the class bell rings

EXT SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

The high school is open air - the hallways are alleyways

between buildings A short kid with eyeglasses the size
of

Because of the orientation of the street this was all
flipped when we shot it and the

hand came from the passenger window The dialogue in the
ending field scene was

changed to match causing mass confusion for about half an
hour on set

Volkswagen headlights sits against the wall Brendan enters
leans on the wall beside him

EXT LOCKER CAGE - DAY

Empty Locker 239 is open its door swinging gently in the
wind

EXT BACK OF GYM - DAY

Brendan sits against the massive building flipping through
loose papers He finds two photographs one of Emily hugging
him the other of Emily with a beautiful sharp-eyed girl at
a party drinks in hand

Sorting more papers he finds a red card with a sequined
mask on the front The bottom edge has been torn off

A huge chunk of brown building Brendan strides towards it
INT SCHOOL THEATER - CONTINUOUS

Drama people sit on the floor facing the stage Brendan

The dog pops up again Kara pulls him down and nuzzles his

BRENDAN
About Emily Kostich

She stops nuzzling a little too quickly

KARA

He breaks into a trot Kara smiles at Brendan

BRENDAN
Still picking your teeth with freshmen

KARA
Guess youre up from the underneath
then The whole Jerr thing blown over
Lucky strikes you and your partner get
bulled you come up clean But I guess
you were always the brains of the
outfit1
One of many instances of an allusion to the Jerr

backstory most of which were

trimmed back in the editing process for clarity The author
has threatened to write it as

a stand alone short story but probably never will so ina
nutshell when Brendan and

Emily were still an item she started hanging out with Jerr
a small time dealer Brendan

didnt approve so he partnered up with Jerr then ratted him
out to Trueman Emily

found out and that led to their breakup on the field which
we see in a flashback

BRENDAN
Wheres Emily

KARA
Sometimes I wonder why I dumped you

BRENDAN
(standing to go)
God

KARA
I dont know where shes at Brendan

INT BACKSTAGE OF THEATER - CONTINUOUS

The play is seen in shadow-play through the backdrop

Brendan slips in through an exit door crosses the backstage
area and enters the dressing rooms
INT DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Cramped and empty Pictures of Kara with friends are stuck
in the mirror Brendan roughly searches drawers bags

LAURAS VOICE

Buzz 42 at the gate Nine oclock But

Brendan hangs up He folds his hands under his chin and
stares at the phone perfectly still The clock on his desk

says 453
DISSOLVE

Brendan at his desk tapping away at Tetris
DISSOLVE
TO

The desk is empty Tetris paused A shower runs behind an
ajar door in the background

EXT STOCKTON COVE GATE - NIGHT
An imposing private community gate Brendan coasts up on
his
bike and ditches it in the bushes He checks the call
box
directory 42 -- DANNON
Using the call box as a hand hold he hops the gate and
walks
briskly up the street
EXT STOCKTON COVE STREET - NIGHT
Shiny cars line the curb Party noises come from an
upscale
two story house Brendan takes a short breath then
strides

up to the front door
INT LIVING ROOM

Large and clean with a two story ceiling and a railed
staircase at one end Fifteen or twenty clean people

some

in costumes mill about in cliques Brendan comes in as
if

he doesnt mind who sees him coming in He gets a couple
odd

stares but no one stops him

With non obtrusive confidence he cuts through the crowd
to

the beer keg in back and draws half a cup

INT PARLOUR - SAME

Richly adorned crowded lit with bright pools of light

Brendan drifts in and stands in the back deep in
shadow

The music comes from a baby grand piano set against one

wall Laura Dannon leans against it She wears a red

imono and is striking against the velvet black piano

Lauras kid sister 11 years old with glasses sits at
the

piano playing All I do is Dream of You

Laura sings lovely and soft but with strength1

Brendan watches from the back his face obscured in
shadow

but his eyes gleam Through the darkened window behind
him

a match flares up and someone standing outside lights a

cigarette

Laura finishes the song The room applauds and she
ruffles

her kid sisters hair
Brendan ducks out and into

By the time we got around to production this had changed to
Someone to Watch Over
Me but the publishing rights proved too expensive (ie
not free) We chose the Gilbert
and Sullivan song which besides being lovely was also in the
public domain (ie free)

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME

Brad Bramish the jock who was kissing Laura in the parking
lot sits slouched on the couch in a dense crowd He holds a
cup and speaks much too loudly to a guy named Biff at his
elbow

BRAD
If the coach wants to play me Ill play
but I cant put my best game in if Ive
got to worry about whether Im going to
be in there Halftime last game coach
is pissed I ran it on a pass play out
on the field he says to me you gotta
think about the team and you gotta you
now and if you run that ball again
youre out and I said to him you gotta
let me play Im out there let me play
and hes saying no youre out and I
ept saying Let me play Let me play
Let me play just right in his face-

BIFF
He was

BRAD

Just Let me play Let me play Let me
play No you gotta No let me play
Let me play Let me play

Brad hunches forward his face swollen purple yelling that
over and over Tom steps in front of Brendan blocking his
line of sight

Brendan scans the rest of the room His eyes catch on Laura
leaning against a divan Her bright sharp eyes cut through
the room straight into Brendan

He wags his eyebrows at her

She looks away quickly Brendan turns back to Brad still
shouting let me play Tom stands between them

BRENDAN
Tom

Brad falls silent Most of the room follows suit Tom turns
around Brendan smiles good naturedly

BRENDAN (contd)
Could you step aside please Im
trying to follow Brads story and its
difficult when I cant see his face

The room watches Brendan Tom mumbles something and steps
aside Brad stares at Brendan stupidly Brendan flashes a
dopey grin and tips his glass

BRAD
(stumbles)
He doesnt give me a play to make what
can I do you know

He falls into awkward silence Biff starts babbling

Brendan looks at Brad who is staring back at him

Brendan then slowly drags his gaze over to Laura staring at
him too her eyes slightly amused Brendan cocks an eyebrow
The slightest hint of a smile takes the corner of her mouth

and she wags her eyebrows once at him

Brendan glances back at Brad looking at Laura now not
amused at all

Brendan stands to go Biff chatters on Brad cuts him off

BRAD (contd)
Hey Hey What are you doing here

BRENDAN
Leaving
BRAD
Oh yeah
BRENDAN
Uh huh Unless your anecdotes got a 2nd
act
BRAD

Why dont you leave

BRENDAN
(leaving)
Thats what I was doing

INT DARK ROOM

With a lit wet bar at one end Brendan goes to the bar puts
ice in a glass and cracks it with liquor
LAURA
(OS)
Whiskey

Brendan pauses glass touching his lips

BRENDAN
Jameson
He downs half of it
LAURA
I like a man who knows what hes
drinking
BRENDAN

Thats a pretty sick thing to be
attracted to

LAURA
Brads not a good guy to get on the
wrong side of

BRENDAN
Uh huh

They stare at each other in silence She studies his face
The broken light of the bar makes her features seem liquid

LAURA
Fearless flyer Quit your yappin and fix
me one
and slips out a sliding glass door
He fills another glass with whiskey and cuts his with water

EXT BACK PATIO - NIGHT

Brendan joins Laura hands her a drink Suburban lights fill
the valley below Laura sips her drink

LAURA
Ill never get through all this

BRENDAN
Uh huh
She sips more

LAURA
I knew your old partner Jerr since grade
school Tough break How long were you
two joined up before your operation got
the sting

BRENDAN
A few months Could have helped himself
out by turning me in but he took the
heat He was a good guy Solid

LAURA
Was he

BRENDAN
You knew him

LAURA
Yeah I did So why are you here tonight

BRENDAN
Im looking for Emily

LAURA
She wasnt invited

BRENDAN
She had an invitation

LAURA
Well like you said Ive got to work on
that Ems been AWOL for a good month
nobodys seen her

BRENDAN
I saw her yesterday

LAURA
Nearly nobodys seen her So what did
she tell you

BRENDAN
(winces)
Score 0 for finesse

LAURA

Listen youre scratching at the wrong
door I wasnt with Emily enough to know
details of what she was in I just got
wind of the downfall and I didnt get
any details of that except that it was
bad So now that were showing some
cards

BRENDAN
If you havent got a finger in Ems
troubles whyd her name get me into
your rather exclusive party

LAURA
Keep up with me now I dont know but
it sounded like you did and a bodys
got a right to be curious Now Im not
so sure

BRENDAN
Well Ill put that body to bed I dont
know a damn thing about whatever
troubles and that works for me I just
want to find her

A long beat Laura studies Brendans face then seems to
come to a decision

LAURA
Coffee and pie

The words hang in the air a moment A look of recognition
from Brendan

BRENDAN
Coffee and pie oh my

LAURA
And you didnt hear it from me

He sips his drink A voice calls from the glass door
Another girl Laura flashes Brendan a look and goes to her
They have quick quiet words and the girl leaves Laura
turns back to Brendan

LAURA (CONTD) (contd)
Will you wait here for me

BRENDAN
Sure

LAURA
Youll stay right here and wait -- Ill

be five minutes

BRENDAN
Yes

The moment she leaves Brendan runs across the lawn and hops
the fence into the neighbors yard

EXT SIDE OF HOUSE
Brendan runs to the edge of the neighboring house and peeks

around Laura comes out the front door cuts across the
lawn and sidewalk and trots out into the street Brendan

begins to follow but a noise from behind the fence stops
him - a match being struck

Brendan creeps towards the fence and peers through a
splintered hole

BRENDANS POV - THROUGH THE FENCE

A brightly lit window in the side of Brads house and
through the window the party

A dark figure wearing a long coat and broad rimmed hat all
inky black The figure smokes a cigarette and watches the
party absently stroking his cheek

Brendan steps back - SNAP A twig

The figure freezes Then making no noise at all it spins
to face Brendan a towering black form against the window

The glowing cigarette falls to the grass
A metallic glint and a clicking sound not unlike a gun

Brendan throws himself backwards onto the grass A beat
Through the hole the black of the figures cloak whips away

Brendan hesitates then hops the fence

EXT SIDE OF BRADS HOUSE - SAME
Brendan lands on his feet No black figure to be found

The cigarette still smolders on the ground Hand rolled
plain paper

Brendan gazes through the window catching his breath Then
he breaks the trance and creeps towards the street

EXT FRONT LAWN - NIGHT

Peeking around the house Brendan sees Laura cut across the
lawn and trot into the street Using parked cars as cover
Brendan follows

EXT STREET

Between cars Brendan sees a lanky kid in baggy jeans and
engineer boots with a clean shaven head leaning against a
black Mustang Laura goes to him and speaks quickly

The dark figure in the hat emerges from the shadows Laura
says something to him Grunting something angrily he gets
in the car with the bald kid and peels off

Laura turns and slowly walks towards the house

When she is gone Brendan stands throws a look back at the
house and walks off down the street towards the guard gate

EXT BACK PATIO

The two drinks where Brendan left them Laura takes hers
and drains it The suburban lights twinkle like stars

EXT CARROWS PARKING LOT - DAY

The sun rises over Carrows family restaurant a squat
structure backed against the weedy edge of the runoff tunnel
ravine

A banner from 1973 in the window - Coffee and Pie oh my

A pack of six pale stoners slump against the rear dumpster

Their beady eyes follow Brendan in sync as he approaches

He goes to the nearest one

Silence and blank stares

stoner

BRENDAN
Wheres Dode

STONER 1
Dunno bra

BRENDAN
Dode

STONER 2
Uh uh

Brendan moves to the next one

A thin head pokes from around the dumpster

Brendan steps around the dumpster
wall thin and delicate in dusty black

DODE
Hey Brendan Maybe you shouldnt be
here

lips muffled intelligence

BRENDAN
Kara told me you know where Ems at

DODE
Uh huh And why are you looking for Em

BRENDAN
She asked for my help

DODE
Uh huh Listen man Ive got plenty on
my plate without dealing with some
jilted ex

BRENDAN
Its not about that

DODE
Whatever its about act smarter than

Brendan calmly moves to the next

Dode slumps against the
Slivery eyes

pale

BRENDAN
Where is she

DODE
Shes with me and right now thats the
best place for her Leave the low life
to the low lifers and dangle

BRENDAN
Youre on the bright side of dim Dode

DODE

The 5 big

Brendans
spinning
dumpster

DODE (contd)
Heel it now dig

stoners appear behind Brendan threatening Dode
head away to light a joint

fist slams into his face sending the joint
Brendan slams Dodes frail frame against the

The 5 stoners stand in the exact same position deer in the
headlights One makes a half hearted motion to intervene

BIG STONER
Back off

BRENDAN
Throw one at me if you want hash head
Ive got all five senses and I slept
last night that puts me six up on the
lot of you

BIG STONER
Just easy-

Brendan slams Dode into the wall

BRENDAN
(to Dode)
Wheres Em

DODE
(deliberate)
Shes with me She was tight when she
called you man Came to and freaked
She told me to shake you if you came by
Said youd only make things worse

Brendan covers how shaken he is by this statement fairly
well He drops Dode

STONER 1 (0S)
Put him down man

DODE
Deal with whatever this aint about and
drop it

BIG STONER

(to Brendan)
Nothing more here bra

BRENDAN
Tell Emily I want to see her Tell her
if she still wants my help or not thats
her business but I want to hear it
straight from her

DODE
She dont -

Brendan walks away

BRENDAN
Today She knows where I eat lunch

When Brendan is a safe distance away the biggest stoner
shouts with conviction

BIG STONER
And stay out punk

EXT SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS
Brendan hides behind a tall clump of bushes

A moment later Dode hustles away from Carrows Brendan
follows
LATER

EXT STREET - EARLY MORNING

The sun is rising as Brendan tails Dode through the twisty
suburban streets

Brendan takes cover as Dode stops by a white hatchback

A girl gets out of the car and embraces Dode Her wrist is
adorned with the same cheap plastic bracelets as the dead
girls arm Dode speaks quickly to her she nods and speaks
back He hands her a slip of paper which she tucks into a
brightly colored address book and slips in her jacket
pocket They embrace again Dode walks off and the girl gets
in her car

Brendan stumbles after the car but it is quickly gone He
watches it go then follows Dode back towards school

EXT SCHOOL THEATER - MORNING

Dode slumps into the front door of the brown building
Brendan watches him from a distance eyes thoughtful After
a beat he turns and walks off into the thickening crowds of
students

FADE OUT
FADE UP
EXT BACK OF SCHOOL - MIDDAY

Brendan eats lunch alone on a concrete wall beside a long
empty utility road behind the school

Reclining on the wall reading Lord of the Flies He
raises his eyes and sits up suddenly

Off in the distance on the utility road a tiny figure
approaches stumbling Brendan jumps and hits the ground
running towards the figure

Meet the girl with cheap bracelets the girl Dode spoke to
the dead girl Emily He catches her just as she stumbles
and falls and carries her into the shade of a covered
His

hallway

EXT SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Emily and
she looks
sniffles

She taps her shoes together lightly

She turns

Brendan sit in silence She is very pretty
bad Too much makeup not enough sleep She
speaks to her shoes

EMILY
I must have sounded pretty crazy on the
phone Yesterday

EMILY (contd)
It was dumb I got paranoid over a
really stupid thing I was high I went
crazy for a little bit but now you have
to forget about it Please Thats how
you can help me now forget about it

her weak eyes to Brendan for the first time

stare is unwavering searching She pushes on

She looks

EMILY (contd)
Brendan I know youre mad at all these
people cause you think I went away from
you and went to them But youve got to
start seeing it as my decision stop
being angry because where I want to be
ats different from where you wanna be

BRENDAN
(angry)
Who fed you that line Em

EMILY
And stop picking on Dode Hes a good

BRENDAN
The Carrows rat

EMILY

(strained anger)

Yeah what are you Eating back here

A beat She taps her clogs One has a hole worn through the
sole Her face contorts seizes up and she is sobbing

EMILY (contd)
Im sorry Brendan

She buries her face in his shoulder He has a hard time
speaking

BRENDAN
Youve got to come back to me Em

EMILY
No No Never Im sorry Never I cant

She embraces him enveloping him in her jacket His face

a frozen mask

EMILY (contd)
Let me go

As she pulls away he mechanically slips an address book
her jacket pocket

He watches her as she walks away

INT CLASSROOM

Brendan sits in the back flipping through the address
The teacher drones on about the significance of the

head in Lord of the Flies1
THE ADDRESS BOOK

Illegible scribbles names numbers nothing that stops
search - then the note Dode gave her a corner of loose-

paper which looks like this

Brendan studies the paper intently

EXT SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

The Brain studies the paper Busses pull into the

lot behind them Brendan is distant lost in thought
THE BRAIN

Hm Do you know anything else about
this

Our one and only scene in a classroom was moved to
Brendans lunch spot to save us

a location change The degree to which the lack of classroom
time in the film has been

commented on has always bemused the author who cannot for
the life of him

remember a single interesting thing that happened in a
classroom in high school

BRENDAN
(shakes his head)
Mm

THE BRAIN
Slim pickings Whyd you let Dode fly
when he came back to whose-her-name at
the theater

BRENDAN

(shrugs dismissively)
Kara Its their turf I couldnt hear
them without being seen and that would
only biff their play Best to know its
there let it ride and see what comes of
it

(touches the paper)
But anyway

THE BRAIN
Hm Well if this is what I think it is
it didnt come straight from Dode less
hes playing out of his league
(beat)
I can only give you my best guess

BRENDAN
Yeah

THE BRAIN
When the upper crust does shady deeds
they do them in different spots around
town I know under the piers one down
by the bike trails in the state parks
another Theres alot of them The pitch
is theyve got little symbols for each
one and thats how they tell each other
the place so word wont get around So
this might be that

BRENDAN
But Dode wouldnt know it

THE BRAIN
This is upper crust Dodes pie pan
grease

Brendan studies the symbol

BRENDAN
Call anything up

THE BRAIN
How many places start with A Or if
its a shape or just a random symbol
Anyway even if you figured it out what
good could you do Shes smart she
knows the play shes gunning to square
things
BRENDAN
Yeah
THE BRAIN
You said her business was none of yours
so shes alright forget it now Go
home sleep
INT BRENDANS BEDROOM - NIGHT
Sparsely furnished Brendan plays Tetris on his computer
staring off into space His moms voice calls Good night
and the hallway light turns off
LATER

1030 by the clock radio on Brendans nightstand The slip
of paper rests beside it Brendan lies in bed staring at
the symbol on the paper His eyes tense

THE SYMBOL

Growing larger burning with a searing intensity then

folding into darkness Water rushes overhead over concrete
concrete with a hole in it -- the runoff tunnel just for an
instant then back underwater screaming Brendan choking
screaming plunging upwards A woman with no face falls from
the darkness and kisses him her long hair sweeping around
him then pulling away As the last strands slide off his
face he wakes up with a start

The clock says 346 Brendan drips with sweat breathing

raggedly He takes the paper and a pencil from the
nightstand and shades the symbol to look like this

FLASH CUT - The runoff tunnel lining up perfectly with the
now shaded symbol

BACK TO BRENDAN

His eyes turn uneasy as he removes his glasses and clicks
off the light

EXT BRENDANS HOUSE - DAWN
Brendan walks off into the hazy pre-dawn light

EXT EDGE OF RAVINE

Brendan stops at a high wall of weeds listening to the low
gurgle of moving water Slowly robotically he pushes
through

EMILYS BODY

Face down bobbing gently in shallow water Bluish white
Red foam clings to her

EXT RUNOFF TUNNEL

Silently as if lowered by a string Brendan sinks down
squatting in the mud His lungs empty in one choppy breath
He pulls his glasses off sluggishly

EMILYS ARM

Lifeless pale
BRENDANS FACE

A contorted frozen mask eyes wet

EMILYS HAIR

Stringy flowing gently in the water

BRENDANS EYES

Dazed drifting then suddenly snapping to attention
A noise From the tunnel

Brendan freezes The inky blackness of the tunnel mouth
opens like a vacuum silent but then -

The scrape of a shoe against concrete then echoing
footsteps running away

Brendan springs like a cat sprinting into the tunnel

INT TUNNEL

Nearly pitch black 2 sets of running footfalls Brendan is
chasing running full speed into the blackness heart
pounding - we almost dont notice that Brendans are now the
only footfalls

Brendan notices He stops Silence in the darkness except
for Brendans breath and someone near

SLAM Brendan takes a fist in the cheek and goes down An
inky black figure steps from the shadows and kicks him in
the stomach Brendan curls on the ground the figure over
him

FIGURE

(low whisper)
Your little Em

The figure runs off Brendan raises his head painfully - the
figure is silhouetted briefly against the distant bright end
of the tunnel then is gone

EXT RUNOFF TUNNEL - EARLY MORNING

Emilys body is still there Brendan crawls out of the

tunnel and collapses in the shallow water beside the body
He rests his head on his arm eyes on Ems hair

EXT CAMPUS - EARLY MORNING

Cold and barren nearly empty Brendan limps across the
barren lawns

EXT PHONE BOOTHS

A line of phone booths on campus Brendan nearly collapses
against one He dials still in a stupor

VOICE ON PHONE
Saint Clement police

Brendan stares into space eyes burning

VOICE ON PHONE (contd)
Saint Clement police hello Hello

Brendan hangs up
EXT LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

Early morning mist below a squat brick building

INT LIBRARY

Warmly lit sheltering the few souls scattered here and
there at tables The Brain sits at one of them reading an
impossibly large book He watches curiously as Brendan
approaches him

THE BRAIN
Hey Brendan

Brendan falls into a chair The Brain looks him over

THE BRAIN (contd)
Youre up early

BRENDAN
(thick distant)
I couldnt sleep

THE BRAIN
(nods back to his book)
Find Emily

Brendan breathes out softly

THE BRAIN (contd)
You alright

BRENDAN
Yeah What are you here for zero

THE BRAIN
Nah I gotta take the early bus cause
the others dont run by my street

BRENDAN
Bad break

THE BRAIN
Eh Time to reads nice So whats the

THE BRAIN
Cant raise her

BRENDAN
No I cant

THE BRAIN

BRENDAN
Now I dont know I guess its I

Brendan takes a long moment He stares down at his glasses
wet with condensation

BRENDAN (contd)
Brain I cant let her go I was set to
but I cant I dont think I can

THE BRAIN
You think you can help her

BRENDAN
No

THE BRAIN
You think you can get the straight
maybe break some deserving teeth

BRENDAN
Yeah I think I could

THE BRAIN
Well

Brendan rubs his forehead

BRENDAN
Kara tried to rope me She came right
out and asked She was scared Tell me
to walk from this Brain Tell me to
drop it

THE BRAIN
Walk from it Drop it
(grins)
Youre thick as what-all Brendan
BRENDAN
Yes I am

Brendan cleans his glasses He looks Brain in the eye
his mannerisms come back into focus

BRENDAN (contd)
Id need you to Op Like on Jerr but
that was cake to this And unlike Jerr
theres not much chance well come out
clean Twenty four seven on this one
You okay to op for me again

The Brain barely smiles

THE BRAIN
What first tip the bulls

Brendan puts on his glasses stands to go

BRENDAN
No bulls would gum it Theyd flash
their dusty standards at the wide-eyes
and probably find some yegg to pin
probably even the right one But theyd

and
trample the real tracks and scare the
real players back into their holes and
if were doing this I want the whole
story No cops not for a bit

THE BRAIN
So what first

BRENDAN
I dont know Your mom still have the
cell

THE BRAIN

In her car

BRENDAN
Borrow it for a few days get me the
number
(stands to go)
Wait for my word and cover for me first
period Im going to be a little late

EXT BASKETBALL FIELD - DAY

A vast field of asphalt segmented by a dozen basketball
courts outlined in cracked paint1 Brendan trudges

across

it his steps heavy He stops and stands very still
staring

at the ground for a beat then raising his eyes to

THE HORIZON

Flat gray pin straight Brendans voice starts
speaking

rapidly confident and clear

This describes the location at my school that the

showdown scenes were originally

written for Between when I wrote the script and when we
shot it however the school

expanded and built portable classrooms on the basketball
field and so we reluctantly

moved these scenes to the football field

edgier

goateel

BRENDAN (0S)
Yeah it was personal Jerr spooked some
decent gees and ran around some what was
straight with him but Im nobodys bull
runner This wasnt a business sit But
yeah I bulled him Got in tight
partnered up and sent him over
PAN AROUND to reveal BRENDAN He looks different
more alive wearing different clothes and a thin
keeps talking directly at us
BRENDAN (contd)
Id bull the lot of them Em Id burn
down the whole party if they tried to
play you again Jerr and whoevers next
I want to keep you safe
An ARM swings into frame wearing cheap plastic
and pale blue fingernail polish It slaps Brendan hard
the face He catches it Emily wrenches her arm away

stumbles backwards onto the pavement

Brendan grabs her sleeve She twists away He grabs her
shoulder grabs her waist she resists and suddenly

are struggling with violent pent up intensity until
shout she breaks away and falls to the ground
A beat Gulls cry in the distance
EMILY
You cant keep me safe Brendan Im in
a bigger world now and you cant hide
me from it and you cant beat it Not
if I dont want you to
Brendans face looks lumpish while Emilys is strong
stands and walks off into the distance across the
field

BRENDANS FACE

Watching her go It is back to present day pale clean
he

peer
forward

the

slips

shaven sullen His eyes are cold with resolve

EXT RUNOFF TUNNEL - EARLY MORNING

Brendan sloshes down into the water Without delicacy
lifts Emilys body and pulls her back into the tunnel

INT RUNOFF TUNNEL

Which Joe would not even consider thank god

Pitch back Brendan lays the body down Two beady eyes
at him from the darkness - he freezes The eyes hop
- a gull The two watch each other for a moment then

gull squawks and flutters out the bright mouth of the
tunnel Brendan follows it without looking back at the
body1

EXT CROWDED HALLWAY - DAY
Brendan and the Brain lean against a wall The Brain
him a piece of paper

THE BRAIN
Theres the cell number

BRENDAN
Keep it on vibrate

THE BRAIN
(pats his jacket pocket)
Yeah

BRENDAN

BRENDAN
Make Ems troubles mine Im going to

THE BRAIN

A very early draft held on the tunnel after Brendan left
and revealed a dark figure

(Dode) creeping away from the top of the tunnel causing the
pebble described on page

1 to plink into the water

BRENDAN
Or bad brick

THE BRAIN
No
BRENDAN
Tug

Tug that might be a drink
BRENDAN

BRENDAN

The Pin yeah

THE BRAIN
The Pins kind of a local spook story
You know the Kingpin
BRENDAN
ve heard it

THE BRAIN

Same thing Supposed to be old like 26
lives in town

All apologies to Frisco Farr who the author did actually
go to school with and who

was neither a druggie nor ‘real trash but was a great guy
who simply had a very cool

sounding name He is now (the author was horrified to learn)
practicing law

BRENDAN
Jakel runner right

THE BRAIN
Big time maybe Ask any dope rat
where their junk sprang theyll say they
scraped it from that who scored it from
this who bought it off so and after
four or five connections the listll
always end with the Pin But Ill becha
you got every rat in town together and
said show your hands if any of themve
actually seen the Pin youd get a crowd
of full pockets
BRENDAN
You think the Pins just a tale to take
whatever heat

THE BRAIN
(shrugs Beat)
But whats first

BRENDAN
A show of hands

INT BACKSTAGE OF THEATER

Brendan strides past forest scenery and drama geeks
through
another door and into sunlight

EXT BACK OF THEATER - DAY
Kara smokes a cigarette Brendan leans beside her

KARA
(annoyed)
Hey Brendan Here for the show

BRENDAN
No

KARA
Would you go then honey cause Ive got
this headache

BRENDAN
Try smoking like a chimney Ive heard
that helps

In an admittedly paltry concession to clarity this was
changed to “Dope runner in post
production

Brendan grabs the pack of cigarettes

BRENDAN (contd)
Isnt this Dodes brand

Kara snaps her head towards him a flash of anger She
catches herself and smiles cooly

KARA
You dont know Dodes brand

BRENDAN
Oh I do now

Angry again Kara snatches the pack from him

BRENDAN (contd)
Im going to start shaking things up
Give me the story and you might miss the
bite

KARA
The story about what

BRENDAN
Alright

He turns and walks away

KARA
The story about what

BRENDAN
I dont want to play games if youve got
a headache Get me if you want to spill
it but I cant guarantee safe passage
after tonight

KARA
I dont know what-
At the stage door not slowing

BRENDAN
Tell the Pin that Brad was my calling
card and I need words

KARA
Brad Bramish
Through the door and into the theater

INT BACKSTAGE OF THEATER - CONTINUOUS

He spins to see Karas face just before the door closes
Shes worried

EXT CROWDED SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
The Brain walks out of a classroom and Brendan swings behind
him

BRENDAN
(fast and low)
Tail Kara through lunch Shes got
rehearsal but shell blow early She
goes home drop her else wait for my
call

The Brain turns and Brendans gone

EXT PARKING LOT - LUNCH

Brendan wanders through the thick lunchtime crowd towards a
cluster of 3 or 4 flashy luxury cars set aside at the far
end of the lot

Brad Bramish sits slouched in the front seat of his
convertible front door open A small crowd hangs about
Brad his crony Biff at his elbow

BRAD
Thats all Im saying is put me in the
game and Ill do what needs to be done
but they dont put me in what needs
doing dont get done and dont come
crying to me man Get off my grill man
you didnt put me in dont come to me
if you didnt let me play

BIFF
They didnt

Brendan scans the rest of the cars His eyes catch on Laura
Dannon sitting in another convertible off to the side Her
bright eyes cut through the crowd straight into Brendan

He wags his eyebrows at her She looks away Brendan walks
into Brads direct line of view and obviously leans against

one of the cars

BRAD
Hey What are you doing here

BRENDAN
Listening

BRAD

Uh huh

BRENDAN
Alright you got me Im a scout for the
Gophers

BRAD
(not amused)
Oh yeah

BRENDAN
Of all things yeah Been watching your
game for a month but that story just
now clenched it Youve got heart kid
How soon can you move to Minneapolis

A few snickers around the crowd but nowhere near Brad

BRAD
(flat with anger)
Yeah

BRENDAN
Cold winters but theyve got a great
public transit system

BRAD
Yeah
BRENDAN
Yeah
BRAD
Oh yeah
BRENDAN

Theres a thesaurus in the library

BRAD
Who invited you

BRENDAN
To the parking lot Well gee I kind of

BRAD
I think youd better leave then
BRENDAN
No Im having too good a time

BRAD
Just the same

Brendan smiles slightly and very deliberately crosses his
legs Brads face tenses

BRAD (contd)
Maybe you want to go someplace more
private

BRENDAN
With you

Brad says who else by lifting his arms

BRENDAN (contd)
(as if hes been asked to the
movies)
Sure

Brendan stands and walks off Brad follows and the rest of
the crowd trails after him

He leads them behind a parked VW van and turns to face Brad
People gather around in a wide circle

Brendan pulls his jacket off as Brad hangs back mumbling

BRAD
You know whats good for you youll just
beat it Beating a small frye wont win
me anything and its not going to do you
any good-

Laura pulls up in her convertible behind Brad watching

In the next moment Brendan cuts Brad off by putting his fist
in his face

Brad grunts but doesnt lose ground Brendan throws his
short stocky frame into Brads larger one and tenderizes his
midsection with jabs

Brad tags Brendan in the ribs then smacks the palm of his
hand into Brendans face shoving him back onto the

pavement

He comes at Brendan with his big fists clenched

Brendan kicks Brad full force in the shins

Brad tumbles and Brendan comes up fast connecting hard
with the point of Brads chin Brad gets his balance fast
and before Brendan can throw another he throws one himself
then another both into Brendans stomach Brendan pulls
back and kicks Brads shin where he had kicked it before
Brad roars and hits Brendan very hard in the face

Brendan bounces back like a rubber ball and throws his
weight into a square punch right into Brads nose

The sound of eggs breaking and Brad falls backwards like a
board

He stays down holding his face

Brendan staggers back breathing hard and looks up at the
small crowd Some stare at Brendan some at Brad but nobody
seems about to do anything Brendan runs his sleeve over his
face and walks unsteadily off pushing past the last few
people rushing over

STRAGGLER
Hey is there a fight

BRENDAN
Yeah

He throws a last look at Laura who meets his gaze and
drives off

EXT SCHOOL PARKING LOT SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

Brendan walks away from the lot towards the school Laura
pulls up beside him in her car

LAURA
Hey

Brendan ignores her and b-lines for the school Laura brakes
hard parking by the curb
EXT SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Brendan limps down the hallway Laura appears behind him
trotting to catch up
LAURA

LAURA

BRENDAN
Go away

Silence behind him He stops turns wearily She looks
genuinely hurt

BRENDAN (CONTD) (contd)
Look I cant trust you You ought to be
smart enough to know that I didnt
shake the party up to get your
attention and Im not heeling you to
hook you Your connections could help
me but the bad baggage they bring could
make it zero sum game or even hurt me
so Im better off coming at it clean

LAURA
I wouldnt have to lead you in by the

hand-

BRENDAN
I cant trust you Brad was a sap you
werent you were with him and so you
were playing him so youre a player
With you behind me Id have to tie one
eye up watching both your hands and I
cant spare it

LAURA

He turns and walks away She doesnt follow
EXT SCHOOL PAYPHONE - AFTERNOON

Brendan slumps against it receiver to his ear licking a
bruised lip He wears dark glasses

THE BRAIN

BRENDAN
Keep him off And keep your specs on - I

THE BRAIN
Okay

Brendan hangs up and turns sluggishly

A lanky kid with a short shaved head and engineer boots
punches him in the face

Brendan hits the pavement The lanky kid is over him ina
split second beating his face and body with short heavy

blows

Flashes of the lanky kid - a shiny scar shaped like a thin
OUT

IN

triangle runs down the side of his face

After a brief silent thrashing the kid walks off with
several other blurry figures A car peels out and roars off
oSs

Brendan lies still The class bell rings very distant Legs
criss cross before his eyes each blurring the world a bit
more until it is completely smeared

EXT SIDEWALK - LATE AFTERNOON

Bordering a supermarket Brendan trudges along Suddenly he
stops Parked in the supermarket parking lot is a black
mustang

EXT PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON

The sun hangs low Brendan approaches the car and walks
around it slowly He peers inside A tuft of paper pokes out
from under the seat He pulls the door handle locked

Brendan picks up a broken chunk of concrete from the ground
waddles over to the car and holds the chunk above his head
ready to drop it through the window

He stops His eyes catch something in the distance

The lanky shaved-head kid whose name is Tugger Coming
towards him fast

Brendan stands there for a moment then lets the chunk fall
to the ground He casually leans against the car removes
his glasses puts them in a hard case and puts the hard case
in his pocket

Tugger hits him like a train and throws him across the
pavement Tug turns back to the car and takes out his keys

them at

Brendan gets up and comes towards Tug his face stiff Tug
turns and pops him once squarely in the mouth Brendan falls
to his knees

While Tug unlocks the door Brendan stands up woozily
Grunting Tug spins and grabs Brendans jacket pushing him
back while he slaps him hard in the face back and forth
three times When Tug lets go Brendan drops like a stone
catching himself on his hands and knees The car door slams

The mustang drives about a hundred yards out into the
parking lot spins around and stops facing Brendan Its
motor purrs deeply Brendan begins to limp towards it
doggedly head up eyes fixed

A crackling roar and short squeal of tires spit the mustang
forward It comes straight at Brendan rumbling like a tank

Brendan stops walking and stands very still eyes steady
The gap between him and the car closes in no time at all

It speeds past him not six inches to his left brushing the
edge of his jacket Brakes squeal behind him Brendan turns
and lopes towards the mustang idling about fifty feet away

He stops at the window Tugger eyes him curiously with
some respect

BRENDAN
I want to see the Pin

TUGGER

(nods slightly)
Yeah I guess you do

EXT STREETS

Twisty and narrow The black mustang flies through
impossible speeds roaring past like a bullet

Tug is putting a tape in the deck eyes down Behind
the trunk pops open then pulls down out of sight just
looks back up

INT TRUNK OF MOVING MUSTANG
Brendan holds the trunk about three inches open just

to see which street signs pass by Loud music plays

The car zooms on

BRENDANS POV

Through the ajar trunk The mustang slides to a stop

an elaborate wooden mailbox carved as an eagles head
Brendan closes the trunk

EXT FRONT OF HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

A small one story house slightly run down Tugger
trunk and drags Brendan out covering his eyes with a
slams the trunk and goes inside

When they are gone the broken trunk drifts open

INT BASEMENT HALLWAY

A very dim narrow hall with a steep stairway at one
dark doors down the length of it and a lit door at the
end Tugger drags Brendan down the stairway drops him

goes into the lit room
Unfortunately Mr Taylor flatly refused which given

the context was probably wise

Brendan lifts his head painfully Surrounding him in the
darkened doorways are dozens of boys some dressed like
Tugger others dressed in black

Tug pokes his head out

TUGGER
Alright

Arms pop out of the darkness and drag Brendan towards the
lit room

INT KINGPINS DEN

A small room amazingly messy Clothes strewn about groves
of empty bottles precarious piles of books The overall
impression though is not of jumbled chaos but of a nest
comfortably woven and very worn in

A slim figure with wispy hair sits facing the wall ata
small desk writing under a green bookkeepers lamp

Brendan is shoved into the center of the room Tug and his
clones slump against the surrounding walls Brendan watches
the thin figures back For a beat the only noise is the
scratching of the thin mans pencil Then he sighs and
swivels around

Mid to late twenties Sallow features tired eyes His
clothes are so richly black it is difficult to make out
specific items -- he is just one inky black mass from the
neck down and eyebrows up

BRENDAN
You the Pin

PIN
Yeah
(beat of silence)
So now Im very very curious what youre
going to say next

BRENDAN
Maybe Ill just sit and bleed at you

The Pin shifts in his seat bored

The Pins

The world turns on its side as Tugger pushes Brendans head

down into

PIN
Helled if youre gonna go breaking my
best clients noses and expect me to
play sandbag Anyway youve been
sniffing me out before then sniffing
for me like a vampire bat for a horse

with a nick on its ear he can suck on
They do that

(Brendan blinks)
So now you got Tugger to bring you here
which he never does and you got me
listening so Im curious what youve
got to say that better be really really
good

BRENDAN
Call Ms Dannon in from the hall first
she oughta hear this

PIN
(amused)
No dice soldier Would have been a neat
trick though

BRENDAN

(shrugs then slowly)
I was going to make up some bit of
information or set up some phony deal
anything so youd let me walk Then I
was going to go to the vice principal
and spill him the street address of the
biggest dope port in the burgh

eyes shoot to Tugger who doesnt flinch

TUGGER
He knows zippo

BRENDAN
1250 Vista Blanca the ink blotter at
the desk in the den in the basement of
the house with the tacky mailbox

TUGGER
You gonna do what now

The Pin walks towards them One of his shoes is twice the

size of the other

PIN
No good soldier

The cronies around the room begin cackling Tugs face is a

mask of rage Brendan cant breath His

PIN (contd)
Alright let up

But Tug doesnt let up Brendans world

face swells

grows hazy the

cackling laughter reverberates then a clean voice pierces

the din

LAURA
(OS)
Tug stop

Tugs face breaks for a moment and he lets go Brendans

head lolls to the side Laura stands in
Brendan sees Tugs knuckles and a flash
moment as Tug hits him in the face The
spills out across the frame leaving us

FADE UP

SMALL DARK ROOM

the dark doorway

of white for a split
Pins black body
in black

Brendan wakes up curled on a mattress on the floor A bare
light bulb hangs from the ceiling Tugger sits five feet
away watching him like a hungry dog Brendan stares back at

him through thick glazed eyes

BRENDAN
Where are my glasses
(Tugger grins)

Hell with ya then Which wall

in

s the door

Tug points amused Brendan heaves himself up and Tug

shoves him back down
Brendan winks at him stands and lurches towards the door
again

Tugger grabs his shirt and slams him into the wall but
freezes when he hears a door latch click Sneering he drops
Brendan back onto the mattress and sits against the opposite
wall

Sounds of a door opening and closing come from the darkness
Light footsteps clack on the cement floor Suddenly Tug
vanishes -- the rooms darkness just seems to swallow him

The thin whispery voice of the Pin speaks softly

PIN
Sorry about this kid but what the hell
with what you said before

His disembodied face appears a few feet about where Tug had
sat

PIN (contd)
Where you were at with all of us and
the Tug a fist away youve got to use
your nut Allay the situation So yeah
youre not scared of me I got it but
Im also thinking youre a little nuts
now so youve got that trade off with
your standing But nuts isnt all bad
so maybe it was a good play I dont
know

He is standing in front of Tug His black clothes and broad
rimmed black hat blend perfectly with the dark room such
that his face seems to bob about in space Brendan stifles a
cough

PIN (contd)
So Laura talked me down Lets get you
upstairs back with the living

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Brendan sits at a breakfast table eating cornflakes The
kitchen is on the first floor of the Pins house or rather
the Pins mothers house She is a soft old lady in a pastel
cotton dress currently bent over the fridge mumbling
MOTHER
I thought we had orange juice Brendan
Im sorry How about Tang or thats
more like soda isnt it or not soda but
it hasnt got any juice in it it cant
be very fortifying

BRENDAN
Waters fine maam thanks

MOTHER
Now just a moment we have apple juice
here if youd like that or milk
though youve got that in your
cornflakes I dont know if drinking it
as well might be too much

BRENDAN
Apple juice sounds terrific

MOTHER
Its country style

BRENDAN
Thats perfect

She shuts the fridge Tugger and the Pin sit behind her
looking comfortably bored The Pin a sharp black hole
against the soft yellow kitchen eats oatmeal cookies with
small delicate bites

MOTHER
Ill even give it to you in a country
glass howd that be Boys

TUGGER
Im fine Mrs M

PIN
Thanks mom

The Pin kisses her on the cheek
MOTHER

Okay well Im going to go um do

She shuffles out

PIN
(to Brendan)

So hows bout we take another snap at

hearing your tale

BRENDAN

I dont know It starts out same as

PIN
Were cooled off

BRENDAN

Yeah well your muscle seemed plenty

The Pin grins thinly uncomfortable

PIN
Looky soldier-

BRENDAN
The ape blows or I clam

TUGGER
(stands violently)

So clam Whatve you got I cant beat
out of you back in the basement

The Pin and Brendan are perfectly still
other

PIN
Give us a few minutes Tug

watching each

Tug turns to him but Pin keeps his eyes on Brendan

PIN (contd)
Ill call you if whatever

Beat Tug stomps off slamming the narrow door hard behind

him The Pin goes back to gnawing his cookie

PIN (contd)
So

Brendan sets down his spoon

BRENDAN
About a year ago I had a small time
dealing partnership with Jerr Madison
Know him

PIN
Till he took the fall for you

BRENDAN
Yeah well I didnt ask him to but he
was a straight player I got out clean -
almost Nothing on my official record
but the VPs play it like I owe them one
When I made it clear I wasnt playing
their hound dog well they didnt like
it They keep calling me in badgering
me

PIN
Gee thats tough

BRENDAN
I dont like being told whose side Im
on So now they think Im on your trail
Im in a nice spot to know their
movements and feed them yours

PIN
I gotcha

BRENDAN
You havent got me yet

PIN
What price

BRENDAN
Considering the benefits my services
could yield I dont think thats
unreasonable

PIN
And what are your services exactly just
so I can be specific on the invoice

painfully

BRENDAN
(shrugs)
Whatever serves your interests

The Pin stands

PIN
Fair enough Ill have my boys check
your tale and seeing how it stretches
well either rub or hire you Youll
know which by end of the day tomorrow

Brendan stands but doesnt follow as the Pin opens the
narrow door Tugger went through and descends the dark stairs
behind

PIN (contd)
Were done

The moment the Pin vanishes into the basements murk Laura
comes up out of it She takes Brendans hand

LAURA
Ill drive you back
INT LAURAS CONVERTIBLE MOVING - SUNSET

They zig zag though the twisty suburban streets Brendan
stares sullenly into space

BRENDAN
Just drop me at school
(they take a hard turn)
How long was I out

LAURA

Half an hour It took all of it for me
to cool the Pin down

BRENDAN
(flatly but sincerely)
Thanks
They drive on in silence

EXT SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DUSK

Lauras convertible stops and Brendan climbs out
He studies her face for a moment

LAURA
You trust me now

BRENDAN
Less than when I didnt trust you
before If you can tell me your angle in
this maybe I can

LAURA
Come here1

Brendan leans on the car his face close to hers

LAURA (CONTD) (contd)
Im on the in top level of the tower
and I know everyone but I dont know
all what goes on I knew Em when she
tried to get with me and Brad and I
liked her She was smart But she wasnt
us and it didnt work When she left
she took some souvenirs dirty habits
she wasnt strong enough to control and
a connection to the Pin to keep them
going With me

BRENDAN
So far

LAURA
A few months go by and the next I hear
the Pins raging over a situation with
some certain junk Em was partial to and
the downfalls coming on Ems head

BRENDAN
You think Em scraped the junk off the
Pin

Not to weasel in a plug but the original version of this

scene (shot as written)

is on the

deleted scenes section of the DVD Available at fine

retailers everywhere

LAURA
I dont know but whether she scraped or
copped or just ran her tab around the
world and into her own back it must
have been grand Ive never seen the Pin
so hot

BRENDAN
This all helps but its not what I
asked Whats your angle in all this

LAURA
I dont know Im usually pretty sharp
but maybe I see what youre doing for

Emily trying to help her And I dont
know anyone who would do that for me

BRENDAN
Now you are dangerous

Throwing the car in gear she peels out and leaves him
standing alone in the fading evening light

INT BACKSTAGE

Brendan pushes through the gloom past forest scenery
deeper and deeper until he comes to a door

INT WOMANS DRESSING ROOM

Hazy and cramped Everything blends into the color of flesh
No walls are visible it is all billowy piles of costumes
Brendan pushes in Kara sits at the mirror putting on
eyeliner

KARA
(sing song)
Brendan Brendan Brendan

BRENDAN
Wheres Dode flopped
(she makes a face)
I know you two are cozed up so youll
tell me or you wont

KARA
Oooh getting feisty
(giggles)
Last time we talked you were giving
ultimate-tims

BRENDAN
It worked You went to Laura didnt

KARA
All part of your plan

BRENDAN

KARA
I feel so cheap and used

BRENDAN
Gol I must seem a real cad Sometimes I
just hate myself

Kara grins dreamily

KARA
Whatever happened to us Brendan

BRENDAN
Wheres Dode flopped

She turns to face him

KARA
We were a pair and a half for a few
months werent we Sometimes I miss
having someone I can talk to You ever
miss having someone I guess you must

Brendans face is a mask

BRENDAN
I need to hear Dodes tale about Emily
Its important

KARA
(darkly)
You better be sure you wanna know
whatcha wanna know

Brendan stands coughing

BRENDAN
Uh huh Lauras working with me now and
Ill have the Pin and Tug in my corner
soon The sooner I get the truth from

Dode or the truth about Dode from you
the safer youll both be No Pass it on
to Dode anyway Maybe hell have the

sense to get out from under you before
he gets hurt

KARA
You didnt did you

Brendan leaves without looking back
INT BRENDANS ROOM - NIGHT
Brendans at his desk on the phone

THE BRAIN
(on the phone)
So what happens now

BRENDAN

Now we wait for the Pins answer Unless
his crew spotted VP Trumans social call
this morning itll be yes Id give us
7030 If were in I get under his skin
and see whats what You stick to Kara
keep your specs peeled for Dode and stay
away from Laura

The Brain is quiet for a beat

THE BRAIN
I think shes with us Brendan

BRENDAN
(too sharp)
Ill let you know when she is

A beat of silence

THE BRAIN
Okay

Brendan gently replaces the receiver and sits for a moment
in silence

EXT LOCKER CAGE - MORNING

The class bell rings and the cage quickly empties Brendan
limps in opens his locker A note falls to his feet It is
folded into a star He pulls it open TWELVE THIRTY PICO and
ALEXANDER

He fishes the old note out and compares them - different
handwriting

The locker cage is now empty and silent except for the
steady sound of heavy footfalls Brendan looks up from the
notes

A lug with a lumpish face is coming towards him He wears a
black trenchcoat over bulbous shoulders and his black hair
comes down over his eyes like a sheepdogs

BRENDAN
You the Pins

No answer The lug keeps coming

BRENDAN (contd)
So whats his answer

Closer not slowing Brendan tightens his hand into a fist
Then CLICK and a long slender switchblade gleams in the
lugs right paw

Brendan jumps back as the lug swipes the blade at his torso
Before the lug winds up for another slash Brendan is
running

EXT CAMPUS SQUARE - DAY

Brendan runs through the empty campus square the lug
follows

EXT SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

Wind rushing sweating the lug very close Their footsteps
clatter on the cement Brendan swings around a corner
doubles back and stops with his back to a wall - hes lost
sight of him

Brendan sweats listening The lugs footsteps echo through
the hallways coming from all directions at once Then it
seems clear - hes down the hall on Brendans right
Brendan dashes left Wrong The lug looms over him his
knife hand flashing Brendans jacket shoulder tears open

and the white filling inside turns red He stumbles back
blindly gets his footing and scrambles out of reach

Brendan sprints away down the hall gaining about thirty
feet on the lug before turning the corner

Brendan drops to a sitting position
THE LUG AROUND THE CORNER

Running fast

BRENDAN

Kicks his shoes off and clambers to his feet The lugs
footsteps are impossibly loud

THE LUG
Just about to round the corner
BRENDAN

On his socked feet running silently back towards the corner
The lugs footsteps crash like symbols as they both come
around the same corner in opposite directions at full speed

Brendan slides like a baseball player tangling his legs
into the lugs The lug pitches forward with frightening
momentum He hits the halls metal handrail with his arms
and head A hollow gong reverberates through the hallway
and the lug falls like a puppet with his strings cut

A wallet with a couple of twenties and a student ID (CHUCK
BURNS) three hash pipes fifteen joints a baggie of weed
and a large brownie in another baggie

Brendan leaves it all on him and staggers off
EXT CAMPUS PAYPHONE - DAY

Brendan breathes heavily into the phone

BRENDAN
Chuck Burns big lug with hair like a
sheepdog

THE BRAIN

(on the phone)
Yeah I know him I just cant pin him to
any crowd Hes definitely not muscle
for anyone He taps the Carrows crowd
but doesnt hang with them If youve
got a guess I could check it out-

BRENDAN
The Pin If hes with the Pin
everythings kablooie and I gotta blow
the burgh

THE BRAIN
Ill check it Im in third now-
Brendan spots the Pins Cady pulling into the parking lot

BRENDAN
Never mind If I dont call by three
call in the bulls

Brendan hangs up and begins walking at a normal pace along
the sidewalk

The cady pulls up beside him and he stops walking The door
swings open and a voice comes from inside

VOICE
Get in

With no perceivable hesitation he does
INT CADILAC - DAY

Brendan sits beside the Pin The windows are tinted and the
car is very dark The seats are pink vinyl The car lurches
forward

Brendan and the Pin are silent for a beat not looking at
each other

BRENDAN
So

PIN
So Tangles

A stocky kid in the front seat turns and reaches into his
jacket For a moment he stays like that hand in his jacket
eyes on Brendan Brendans face is placid
Tangles pulls out an envelope and drops it in Brendans lap

PIN (contd)
Thats what youll get every week for
your services Less of course theres a
specific job involved in where you get
sliced in with my crew Square

BRENDAN
Yeah

Silence The Pin holds his hat in his hands fingering the
rim

Eight oclock
The car stops
EXT CAMPUS PAYPHONE - DAY
Brendan climbs out of the car on the exact spot they
picked
him up The Cady drives off Brendan checks his watch
BRENDANS WATCH
1232 A phone begins to ring
EXT PICO and ALEXANDER - DAY
Brendan looks up from his watch and answers the
payphone

holding the receiver to his ear in silence

VOICE
(on the phone)
I know what you did I saw what you
did1
The voice is low and garbled filtered through
something

BRENDAN
So

VOICE
Anyone I tell it would ruin you some
way And Im going to tell someone

BRENDAN
Are you making an offer

VOICE
Maybe Or maybe Ill just do you in

BRENDAN
Hire another hash head to blade me

Originally the source of this call was supposed to be a
mystery but during post
production we decided it was one layer too many and
identified the caller as Dode
Brendans first line was overdubbed in post to say Dode
instead of So

VOICE
Dont need no blades shamus I just
gotta squawk

BRENDAN
What do you want

VOICE
Just to see you sweat

CLICK Brendan replaces the receiver and stands still fora
moment Then he inserts a coin and dials

THE BRAIN
(on the phone)

Brendan

BRENDAN
Yeah

THE BRAIN
You alright

BRENDAN
Yeah Im fine Keep digging on the
Burns lug but the main thing is to find
Dode He set up whatever Emily walked
into its getting more and more urgent

EXT BEACH - NIGHT1

A bonfire burns about a hundred feet off Figures jump
through the blaze to thrash music The Pin and Brendan
wander towards us on the dark beach

I gotta lay something out Youre coming
into a certain situation and Im
bringing you in sort of because of it

If ever you want to witness a look of pure horror shoot a

micro budget feature film and

tell your cinematographer that there will be an extended
scene on a beach at night

Turns out its difficult to light up a beach without very
large and expensive equipment

Who knew Shooting at sunset proved a fortunate and less
horror inducing solution

(beat)
I didnt tell Tugger to hit you for the
Brad Bramish thing Laura and I I
decided I oughta hear what you were
gunning for before I made an enemy Tug
just did it though He was hot and he

The waves crash Behind them with no warning at all a
train shoots by Tug stands with his hands jammed in his
pockets flashing lights and gleaming metal streaking and
squealing behind him

Brendan compares the two notes from his pocket with Lauras
- distinct handwriting on each

TRUEMAN

EXT THE PINS HOUSE - DAY

The bird of prey mailbox looms ominously Brendan knocks on
the front door No answer He presses lightly on the screen
door and it gives

INT KITCHEN - SAME

Empty Brendan crosses the warped linoleum and gently opens
the narrow basement door He descends into inky gloom

INT BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME
Deathly still and silent Barely breathing Brendan goes to
the lit doorway at the end of the hall

INT PINS DEN - SAME

Empty Brendan floats through the room like a ghost to the
Pins desk

Slowly then with greater confidence he rifles through it -
papers and trinkets meaningless

He reaches beneath the desk knocking it gently with his
knuckles Quickly he removes the top drawer and reaches down
into the desk frame

Brendan draws out a stack of hundred dollar bills two inches
thick He pulls out another Another Another Thumbing the

stacks -- pure hundreds
Something creaks in the hallway

Brendan freezes Silently he replaces the money and drawer
his eyes on the doorway He creeps towards the door on the
balls of his feet

INT BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME

Still empty Brendan creeps towards the stairs passing
other doorways all open but for one He stops for a moment
listening - silence

INT STORAGE ROOM - SAME

Brendan enters the room - pitch black but for a small high
window Brendan pulls the curtains aside A beam of sunlight
spills just enough light to reveal a figure in the dark
Brendan jumps back and his reflection in the large mirror
jumps as well

A white bird nesting in the window flutters into the dark
room

Brendan walks the large mirror into the beam of light
reflecting it around the room like a flashlight More junk
a mattress then a strangely bare corner with a single white
lump in it The white bird stands behind the lump its dark
eyes caught in the bare light

The bird flies out the window

Brendan goes to the white lump a small brick of white
powder White chalky residue patterns the floor -- there
were other bricks there before

Behind Brendan in the mirror something moves Someone
else in the room

Tugger He throws Brendan across the room then heaves him
into a wall

TUGGER
What with the poking genius Maybe
youre poking for your bull friends

BRENDAN
Dont be a sap I cant even face up at
school the VPs so hot for me

TUGGER
Yeah well Maybe youre looking to make
good

BRENDAN

Pins played not to gum it but just so
when its tail jams in my back Ill know
who to bill for the embalming

TUGGER
You oughta ask him what you wanna know

BRENDAN

Tug loosens his grip Brendan gasps for air

BRENDAN (contd)
When a gee Im paid to side with wont

nervous Makes me angry

Tug draws back a bit

TUGGER
Yeah well Thats understandable

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Tug sets a country glass of orange juice in front of
Brendan He paces

TUGGER

TUGGER
Ah yeah There were problems with that

BRENDAN

TUGGER

He stops thinking harder than hes used to His scar
reddens slightly then he jerks out of his trance

TUGGER (contd)
(quickly)
It disappeared Someone skimmed it We
started raising hell with all the likely
suspects and whatayaknow it came back
But it came back bad One of ours took a
dose off the top and it laid him out

BRENDAN

TUGGER

Brendan throws the car into drive and they jerk forward
EXT STREET CORNER - DAY

The mobile customer you have called is

Brendan slams the phone down violently and walks back
towards the car His legs quiver and a coughing fit hits

Hacking and spluttering he falls to his knees Lauras arms
wrap around him except it isnt Laura its Emily Brendan
spins backwards into

DARKNESS

Emily kissing his mouth her hair around him but it isnt
her hair its Lauras Brendan shoots upwards

INT LAURAS CAR STATIONARY - DAY

He holds her shoulders A beat then her face registers
resignation

EXT BASKETBALL FIELD - DAY

A flat plane of pebbly asphalt with a dozen basketball
courts faintly outlined across its surface Brendan stands
crooked watching the barren horizon The wind blows
bitterly and the sky is dark

Then a speck Coming towards Brendan across the field
Brendan slumps towards it Closer Still a dark dot Closer

Brendans face snaps into recognition

BRENDAN
What are you doing Dode

Dode grins He holds a newspaper

BRENDAN

DODE
I loved her And I woulda loved the kid

Brendans face is empty Dode walks stiffly away Brendan
puts a hand on his shoulder but shrinks back in a coughing
spasm Dode grabs Brendans wrist and hits him in the face
Brendan hits the pavement

EXT HEAVEN - DAY

Bright clouds sharp light Emily flies towards us glowing
then dimmer her wings splutter out the clouds turn gray
and we are looking at Emilys picture in the newspaper
article
EXT BASKETBALL FIELD - DAY

Brendan pulls the newspaper off his face lying in a fetal
position Dode is nowhere to be seen

Slowly painfully Brendan hoists himself up He coughs and
splutters barely able to keep his footing

He limps across the field Every step is agony The wind
blows against him The black field seems impossibly long
still he keeps limping forward towards the ravine

EXT RUNOFF TUNNEL - DAY
Brendan slides down the embankment landing on his feet

Gathered around the drain tunnel entrance are Tugger the
Pin five of Tuggers flunkies and Dode in the middle
Everyone looks at Brendan

A long silence Brendan clears his throat

BRENDAN
Whatd I miss

More silence

PIN
Dode here says Emily Kostich is dead

Nobody reacts to that Brendans face is placid

BRENDAN
Oh yeah

PIN
Yeah He says he knows who did it He
says he knows where the bodys at
(beat of silence)
And he says he wants more money than I
think the informations worth
BRENDAN
That so Dode
(to the Pin)

So walk Whats the info have to do with
you anyways
DODE
Plenty

PIN
Plenty he says

BRENDAN
Uh huh And he wants cash on the nail
Hes a pot skulled reef worm with more
hop in his head than blood Why pay for
dirt you cant believe

DODE
Youll believe this

BRENDAN
(shrugs)
Maybe you will

DODE
Youll believe it cause its someone
close to you Real close

The Pin looks up at Brendan whose face is loose and

nonchalant
BRENDAN
Maybe its hot but its Dode you cant
trust it
DODE

Real close

Tuggers eyes are locked on Dode his scar the color of raw
liver Brendan laughs and turns away

BRENDAN
Im getting my shoes wet for this Let
him milk you if you want

PIN
(to Brendan)
Stay
(to Dode)
Its still too much

DODE

No its not You wont complain when you
hear it

Tugger twists a stick in his hands Brendan watches him

curious
BRENDAN
(murmurs)
So maybe you should
DODE
You had her against the wall with the
brick -
PIN
I know my business Its still too much
DODE
(with growing confidence)
Its not cause thats not why she was
killed and its real important to you
cause the person who killed hers real
close and cause hes got a lot to lose
and he knows if I dont bury him by
spilling to you I spill to the bulls and
bury him for real and hes really
really scared - she had a kid in her and
he couldnt stand -
Tugger springs like a cat He grabs Dodes hair and
knees
his face

Brendan stumbles towards them

BRENDAN
Tug its alright

Tug has Dode on the ground kicking his stomach and chest

PIN
Tug stop

Tug backs off Dode raises his head
Tug pulls the gun from his jacket
Brendan yells slips and falls into the shallow water

Tug levels the gun at Dodes head and fires one shot The
back of Dodes skull comes off

The rapport reverberates through the black tunnel behind

OUT

IN

them and birds fly out Dode remains upright for a moment
then falls limp into the water

The Pins face is stupid lifeless Tug turns to him gun in
hand

PIN (contd)
(thickly)

Tugger fires - dirt kicks up and the Pin scrambles back
Brendan crawls towards Tug yelling for him to stop

Tug fires twice more both misses and the Pin is away
Distant sirens

Brendans vision blurs He stumbles and falls into the
shallow water

THE FAN

Spinning dizzily from Brendans POV Then the fan is still
and the room is spinning then the fan then the room
Brendan clamps his eyes shut A door creaks open

BRENDAN
(croaks)
Go away

Laura floats across the room to him Her hair falls around
him Brendan shrinks back She puts a pale hand on his
clammy forehead Brendan tries to speak but cannot

He fingers slide over his face She pulls off his glasses

Her hands all over his face Brendans throat contorts ina
hard swallow His eyes are wet

Her hair her hands all warm and gentle touching him

LAURA

Brendan breaks In silent sobs first then shivering with an
almighty release he cries like a baby in her arms

BRENDAN
Alright stop

Her smoke drifts into the fan
LAURA

I wasnt serious but we could go for
awhile Just until everything clears

Brendan watches the smoke She stubs the butt out in an ash
tray on the table and curls against his chest

Stretching his arm across the table he nonchalantly spins
the ash tray around with his finger

His glasses lay on the table Through the left lens the
cigarette is magnified Pale blue arrow on the filter

Lauras arm stretches across his chest He looks at it then
up at the fan spinning

Crowded with tense looking punks half dressed like the Pin
and half like Tugger The Pins mom is shuffling about
pouring them milk

INT BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME

Several more punks from both camps crowd the hall and more
lean in the darkened doorways Brendan passes through
quickly

INT PINS DEN - SAME

The Pin at his desk flanked by two of his boys Tug sits in

Fine Tangles

BRENDAN
Johnny go with him
They go

Tug just stares at Brendan then tosses his hands up
slightly and turns away

They all wait

CRASH from the next room Everyone freezes More breaking
then scuffling and shouting

The two punks look at their bosses then run out Tug starts
to follow but Brendan holds him back

The noise through the wall grows tremendous a full brawl
The ceiling pounds and shudders with footfalls and bodies
hitting the ground

Then from not too far away a gunshot
The Pin stands and goes towards the door but Brendan shouts

BRENDAN (contd)
No

and slams it shut A few tense seconds

Another gunshot Footfalls then Tangles falls through the
door his chest red The Pin bends over him

TANGLES
(gasping)
The brick its gone The bricks gone

Tangles stops gasping
The Pin stands eyes blazing at Tug

PIN
Make peace huh Talk it out Get your
boys in my den soes you could snag it
under my nose

Tugs scar is fiery red He coils his body snarling

TUGGER
Alright

BRENDAN
No thats not-

PIN
Was it bad Tug Snag it so I dont
know or sell it off to flat the war
odds

BRENDAN
(shouts)
Pin think about it-

grabs

TUGGER
Alright I did all that
Tug blows past Brendan like a train and slams the Pin into
the ground with his fist He punctuates his words with hard
straight blows into the Pins face

TUGGER (contd)
I cut the brick I stole the money I
faked a peace I snagged your junk I
did it all

He pulls the gun

Brendan shouts and throws himself on Tugs arm wrenching it
sideways The gun clunks onto the carpet

The Pin flips Tug over and for a moment Brendan is caught
between them hit and torn rolling over the gun Tug

it Brendan grabs his wrist and the gun goes off firing
into the ceiling Plaster sprays

Brendan screams thrashing wildly and manages to slip out
of his bloodied jacket and out from between the two

The Pin is on top pinning Tugs gun hand to the carpet
straining to keep it there

Brendan leaps to his feet staggers then winds up and kicks
Tug in the wrist with all his strength

A terrible crunching popping sound Tug roars Brendan takes
the gun from his limp hand

PIN
Do him

Brendan backs off a few steps The Pin strains to keep Tug
down

PIN (contd)
Do him now

Brendan stumbles back Tug roars flips the Pin over and
beats his face mercilessly

Brendan stumbles out into the hall

INT BASEMENT HALLWAY - SAME

Empty From the darkened doorways and the thin ceiling
relentless sounds of fighting

Brendan walks backwards as if in a trance eyes glued to the
Pins door Inside wild shadows splay across the walls and
the Pin shouts Brendans name

Light flashes from another darkened doorway and the wall
beside Brendan splinters Brendan spins on his heel and
fires three shots into the darkness which falls silent

He turns the gun back on the Pins doorway

With a spray of sparks the doorway turns dark They broke
the lamp

The dark doorway looms up before Brendan inky black
Horrible sounds come from it blows breaking bone screams
The Pin screams Brendans name over and over calling for
help Pleading Brendan steps back

fq

Time slows down Brendan drops the gun

t thunks on the carpet

n one motion Brendan kicks the gun down the hall into the
Pins doorway turns and runs into the room where he found
the brick

INT STORAGE ROOM

Dark Brendan runs through clawing past dark fighting
shapes running like a man possessed He breaks through the
darkness and heaves himself up through the small window

EXT FRONT OF PINS HOUSE - NIGHT

Brendan scrambles out slips on the grass and hits the
ground hard

Two sharp gunshots come from the house
Everything is suddenly still Brendan stands slowly

He notices a light from the Mustang - the trunk has drifted
open
ouT

IN

Inside a pale blue arm lies tangled in black plastic Blue
fingernails Cheap plastic bracelets

Brendan shuts the trunk solidly then walks off down the
street and vanishes into the inky night

A moment later police cars pull up sirens blaring lights
turning the dark streets bright as day

FADE

FADE

EXT SCHOOL PAYPHONE - EARLY MORNING

The morning is cold and clammy Brendan slumps against the
payphone

BRENDAN

THE BRAIN
No Stayed there till six thirty then
walked to school

BRENDAN
But she came straight to school from
Tugs
THE BRAIN
Yeah

BRENDAN

She there now

THE BRAIN
Yeah Not with me but here

BRENDAN
Alright Tell her I wanna meet up on the
basketball field in half an hour then
go home and get some sleep

THE BRAIN
Alright
Brendan hangs up then pauses lost in thought

EXT SIDE OF GYM - LATER

Brendan sits against the massive gym building writing ona
piece of looseleaf paper

EXT ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - LATER
Brendan slips the paper under a door stenciled VP Offices

EXT BASKETBALL FIELD - LATER

Cold barren Wind whistles softly and jangles the metal
mesh basketball nets like windchimes

Brendan stands crookedly hands in pockets eyes trained on
the cold black horizon A speck appears Brendan waits for
it bracing himself against the wind

Laura She puts her arms around him a warm embrace Brendan
draws back

LAURA
(softly)
Did you see it all With Tug and the
Pin

Brendan looks at her a moment

BRENDAN
No I took your advice and didnt go

LAURA
(confused)
No
BRENDAN
What happened

Laura looks at him strangely a little uneasy

LAURA
The papers say six dead three around
the house one girl in the trunk of
Tugs car and the Pin and Tug

Brendans face is frozen in an ambiguous frown

BRENDAN
Yeah
LAURA
Tug tried to shoot his way out when the
police got there They tied him to Dode
too Same gun And the girl

BRENDAN
Huh
LAURA
Well good thing you werent there

BRENDAN
Yeah

Lauras face softens a bit

LAURA
You think the girl was Emily

BRENDAN
Probably

Laura embraces him again and doesnt let go

LAURA
You loved her

BRENDAN
(distant)
Yeah I did

LAURA
You did all this cause you loved her
And now its finished
(tightens her embrace)
I love you
BRENDAN
No

Laura pulls back looks at his face It is a mask

LAURA
What

BRENDAN
No its not finished Tug pulled the
trigger on Em and he got the fall but
the bulls coulda found that out without
me
Laura pulls back more

BRENDAN (contd)
I set out to know who put her in the
spot who put her in front of the gun
That was you angel

LAURA
(drifting back further)
What are you talking about

BRENDAN
It was you What you want the whole
tale You want me to tell it to you

LAURA
(bewildered)
Tell it to me

BRENDAN
Alright from the top You had your
fingers in Brad Bramish for appearances
and to keep him buying from the Pin who
you were hooked with Emily came to you
and Brad you saw her for what she was
an insecure little girl trying to get
in She goes on the backburner
Meanwhile maybe youre getting bored
maybe just greedy so when the Pin
scores big with the bricks you take your
shot You hook one take half and cut
it back to size but you cut it bad
Maybe accidentally maybe to down the
Pins operation doesnt matter You put
it back but poor Frisco doses off it
and lands in a coma

(voice strengthening)
So now the Pins fuming maybe hes
jealous of Brad so he comes to Brads
crowd looking for blood or at least a
scape You know trouble Theres going
to be a war over this And theres
Emily She trusts you She wants in
Its duck soup

LAURA
(murmurs)
No

BRENDAN
You frame her for the bad brick then
you cut her loose You turn on your heel
and bite her in the throat Last week on
the payphone Pico and Alexander she
saw something she was scared of Tugs
car driving by the Pin driving but she
wouldnt have seen the Pin No she was
across the street angel She saw the
passenger side She saw you She saw you
and ran like she saw some devil

Lauras face is very still quivering

LAURA
Brendan why are you-

BRENDAN
And she took the hit Dode hid her away
but the Pin was on to her tracked her
down told her to meet him that they
would make good Gave her a time anda
place And sent Tug Just to get the
straight But maybe you had talked Tug
up or maybe he just blew a fuse but Em
sprung it on him that she had her kid
and he did what anyone could count on
Tug doing - he hit her She took the hit
for you You let her take it

LAURA
Stop it

BRENDAN
Thats the tale

LAURA
Stop it

BRENDAN
Youre going to tell me its not

LAURA
Its not

BRENDAN
Look at me

She crumples against him looking him straight in the eye

LAURA
You know me Ive only helped you How
can you - It isnt true

She sobs through a tensed straight face Brendan holds her
stare but his eyes are distant

BRENDAN
I hope it isnt I want you to have been
on my side all along not just trying to
get me under your thumb like Brad and
the Pin and Tug

LAURA
No-

BRENDAN
But I think you knew that meeting was
going to blow up I think that was your
final play But I hope Im wrong I hope
everything I wrote in the note I dropped
at Gary Truemans office this morning is
wrong About your and Brads involvement
in the Pins runnings I hope you didnt
steal the brick last night In your
purse

LAURA
(breathes)
I didnt
BRENDAN
Thats good That means you didnt let
me walk into a slaughterhouse You
didnt lead Tug and the Pin and their
crews to the slaughter And when Trueman
reads the note takes my cue and
searches your locker he wont finda
damn thing

Something changes in Lauras eyes
EXT LOCKER CAGE - INSERT

Trueman and several other men force Lauras locker open
From its dark interior the chalky white brick falls out
spins through the air and shatters silently on the locker
cage floor

EXT BASKETBALL FIELD - SAME

A moment of silence between them The basketball nets
jangle

Laura steps back She looks as if she has been punched in
the face

LAURA
(murmurs)
Brendan dont

BRENDAN
(gently)
Its done

Her face does strange things subtle contortions
She watches his eyes He doesnt look at her Her voice
shakes

LAURA

Done Well Thats most of it 9 out of
10 I told Em to tell Tug it was his
Told her it would soften him up She
said she wished she could keep it but
she didnt love the father I was going
to drive her down the next day wed
found a doctor Most wouldnt She was
starting to show 3 months You know

whose kid that makes it or have you
known all along

Slowly steadily she straightens up Her figure takes back
some dignity She steps towards him deliberately Closer
Right up against him

She brings her head to his puts her lips to his ear
breathes warm breath and says two words The first is

LAURA (contd)
Mother-

the second is low guttural and lost to the whistling wind
She turns and walks briskly away

Brendan watches her go across the dark barren field of
asphalt

Metal jangles Brendan turns to see the Brain hopping a
chain link fence Brendan turns his eyes back on Laura

BRENDAN
You get your straight

THE BRAIN
Yeah I wouldnt have-

BRENDAN
Stalright

THE BRAIN
Yeah well Chuck Burns came to The
knife guy Spilled it all to the bulls
guess Brad Bramish hired him On his
own just a grudge thing

BRENDAN
(nods slightly)
Fits You did good Brain Go sleep

THE BRAIN
Yeah you too

The Brain starts to walk away but turns back

THE BRAIN (contd)
Whatd she whisper to you

BRENDAN
She called me a dirty word

THE BRAIN
Alright you dont have to tell me
Thick

BRENDAN

As what-all

Brendan stands alone on the asphalt field watching
Laura until she reaches the end of the field and walks
off behind a twisted chain linked fence

The first period bell rings and Brendan walks back
towards campus

FADE OUT
