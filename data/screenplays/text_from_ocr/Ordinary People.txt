great believer in psychiatry

DR BERGER
Okay

CALVIN
I know what happens here is only
between you and him andI like
that I respect that
Andhes better I can see
that I am not trying to put you
down I just dont believe in
psychiatry as a panacea for
everybody

DR BERGER
Neither do I

Calvin laughs

CALVIN
I wish I knew what the hell I was
doing here

DR BERGER
Well you said you thought you
could shed some light on some
things What did you mean by that

CALVIN
I dont know actually Im not
sure I think I meant in terms of
Conrad You see I knew something
was wrong even before he tried
to to kill himself But I
thought that Its clear that
hes very smart Hes been an A
student ever since he started
school and naturally I thought
that intelligent people could
work out their own problems

DR BERGER
But you still feel responsible

CALVIN
Yeah sure I do Its hard not to
It was luck It was just luck
that I happened to be there when
he tried it I could have been at
a meeting We both couldve been
away It was luck

DR BERGER
You think of yourself as a lucky
man then

CALVIN
No No No I used to I used to
think that I was a lucky person
before the accident

Mmm I guess the whole of life is
nothing but an accident is it
What happens to you I should do
with it

DR BERGER

That sounds more like the
philosophy of a drifter than a tax
attorney

CALVIN
Yeah Maybe maybe I am drifting a
little I can see myself and I

can see the two of them drifting
away from me and I just stand
there watching

DR BERGER
What would you want to do about
that

sides of this fence

that didnt cry at the funeral you
