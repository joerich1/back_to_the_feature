OTTO
Project flows will continue to
place upward pressure on gross
margins in the third fiscal
quarter The solution my friends

development

Dark-suited Thugs BURST into the conference room scanning
the crowd

increase ROI in the long run

The Thugs rapidly exit the conference room and continue down
the hallway

(to the Board Members)
Sorry to interrupt

Hannah slips down the shades from her forehead In one fluid
gesture she lights her next cigarette with her last one

INT SKYSCRAPER - DAY

We FAST FORWARD through a familiar looking office building
FLY PAST familiar looking elevators ZIP past familiar
looking cubicles and conference rooms and SKID TO A STOP in
a spacious corner office

INT OFFICE - DAY
And here we see A THIRD VERSION OF OTTO a neurotic writer

We are now in an ordinary world as opposed to the stylized
world of the previous scenes

In contrast to the slick handsome Otto the real life Otto
has thick Woody Allen glasses and a frazzled expression

Ottos book agent shuffles papers around his desk where a
chrome name plate announces his name MIKE KIM

MIKE
I dont understand the pages
Youre giving me two versions of
one story I need one good novel
not two bad ones

OTTO
I cant decide between making the
male empowered or making the female
empowered Only one of them can
drive the story-

MIKE
-The dialogue I mean do people
really talk that way

OTTO
-Its a genre piece-

MIKE
-Thugs in zuit suits purple
Cadillacs-

OTTO
-Its called style-

MIKE
-And dont you think its a bit
self-referential Otto its
embarrassing I feel like Im
reading the diary of your personal
fantasies
OTTO
What are you talking about

MIKE
Calling the main character Otto
Cmon Sometimes I think you need
a therapist more than a book agent
the way youre constantly referring
to yourself in your writing

OTTO
Hah hah

MIKE
And whats with this Hannah
character Do you have a thing for
my assistant

OTTO
What No That characters not
based on your assistant at all
Hannahs a pretty name

MIKE
Right Well you cant keep going
on with this duality Otto Youre
going to need to pick one version
Its a shit or get off the pot
situation

OTTO
I know I know you need a book
sale Well I need to give up
teaching fourth graders before I
hang myself from the monkey bars

MIKE
Otto youve never made this
company a red cent Now I believe
in your talent but I cant keep
you on the roster here forever and
you know that Youre a dinosaur
Otto - I mean Jesus Christ you
still write on a typewriter

Otto stands up and paces in circles around the office

OTTO
I cant afford better My landlord
- the mobster - hes shutting off
power to my apartment

MIKE
Your landlords a mobster Thats
what I love about you Otto
imagination

OTTO
What imagination He conducts
business out of a flooring supply
warehouse - its got to be a drug
front I have to deliver my rent
in unmarked bills

MIKE
I dont see where this is going-

OTTO
Mike Im on the verge of total
ruin here - I cant survive the
summer on what they pay me and I
cant go back to teaching in
September I hate it I hate it it
withers my soul

MIKE
Let me call you a waah-mbulance
If youre feeling impoverished
welcome to writing Go channel it
into your art

OTTO
Im telling you Mike I cant
sleep at night Im filled with
existential dread I cant do it
Mike I cant do it -

MIKE
Otto choose one version of your
story and write it fast The
partners are reviewing our client
roster next week I have to
justify keeping you in our stable

Otto fishes a pack of cigarettes out of his pocket
clumsily lights one up

MIKE (CONTD)
Otto you dont smoke Jesus are

OTTO
Yeah Im - I have no idea how Im
going to - I just - Im scared that
I - I feel like I - Yeah Im fine

and

MIKE
(gently)
Otto starting a writing career

absolutely incredible

Otto nods his head lost in his thoughts

Are you alright Are you alright

Mikes words dissolve and fade as we --

OTTO
Listen don’t worry I’ve thought
about this situation a million
times before If we start to run

a tennis ball

OTTO
Better than the stink of
suffocation

HANNAH

HANNAH
So Ill smoke a quarter of the
cigarette and we’ll clam bake

OTTO
(coughing)
No way Think of the second hand

Otto SWATS the cigarette from Hannahs mouth It lands on
the trunk floor in a patch of spilled motor oil which
promptly IGNITES

HANNAH

Hannahs cloth skirt smolders and then CATCHES FIRE

HANNAH (CONTD)

casually dressed and looks a little frazzled from the office

Hannah pulls out a cigarette

HANNAH

Otto is shocked but nods his head in meek acquiescence

OTTO
Been a long day

Hannah exhales filling the elevator with a plume of smoke

HANNAH

OTTO

Ottos eyes water from the cigarette smoke

HANNAH

pants looks as cool and confident as a rock star

EDEN
I suppose youre wondering why I
havent killed you

OTTO (OPPOSITE)
The question had crossed my mind

EDEN
The truth is I just want to talk
And you two arent easy to get a
meeting with

HANNAH (OPPOSITE)
Youll be meeting with my legal
team as soon as we get out of here

OTTO
Who are you

EDEN
I work for the US Government I’d
flash you a badge but my agency
doesn’t formally exist Those
pages you were after are being sold
to the highest bidder We cannot
allow those pages to fall into the
wrong hands

HANNAH
What pages are you talking about
EDEN
The pages locked in the top floor
of the LaSalle building that you
were attempting to break into
before our agents intercepted you

HANNAH
Riiight
(to Otto)
Does she know Im a litigator

OTTO
What do you need us for

EDEN
We would go in and seize those
papers ourselves however we cannot
get any dirt on our hands

OTTO
Because your agency doesn’t exist

EDEN
Exactly The both of you have
ample skills to do the job for us

OTTO
Who do you think we are

EDEN
One of you is a top spy for another
government agency that isnt
supposed to exist An agency I
have no authority over

OTTO
And the other

EDEN
Is the most successful bank robber
in America

Hannah and Otto look each other up and down

HANNAH
You expect us to believe this

EDEN
(shrugging)
In a word Yes I need you to do
this job for me

OTTO
If you need us why were your boys
shooting at us

EDEN
They were protecting the documents
Then we realized you could be of
service to us

Otto shakes his head

I don’t see the angle in this

Neurotic writer Otto sits across from his psychiatrist The
chrome nameplate on his desk announces his name DR ABE
BARD Everything about Dr Bard and his office is similar to
Ottos agent Mikes

Dr Bard rifles through Ottos manuscript Otto reclines on
the psychiatrists sofa

DR BARD
The pages are confused jumbled as
if you have a split personality
This is all about your inability to
get a woman You either want to be
more Alpha like your Otto
character or find an Alpha female
like Hannah who will do all the
work for you

OTTO
Why do you feel this way

DR BARD
Everyone has two personalities
their persona who they like to
think of themselves as and their
ego who they really are The goal
of every self-actualized person
and the purpose of psychoanalysis
is to bring these two people into
harmony

OTTO
According to whom

DR BARD
Carl Jung Jung believed he
himself had two personalities

OTTO
Tell me more about this

DR BARD
Your writing is becoming more and
more fractured disjointed

OTTO
And how does this make you feel

DR BARD
It makes me worried about what this
means for your personality

OTTO
Have you heard of Esprit
d escalier

DR BARD
Staircase wit You only think of
the perfect comeback after the
dinner party when you’re heading
down the stairs

OTTO
Right

DR BARD
I see This is why you want to be
a writer To have all the time in
the world to examine the
possibilities and think of the
perfect line

like speed chess and I just want
to play chess

So how is the writing Is it
flowing

OTTO

Oh yeah I worked really hard
today I’m exhausted

Otto compulsively rearranges the salt pepper ketchup and
napkin holder

Budgen Every night theyd meet at

So how is assisting

HANNAH

Endless monotony

OTTO
So why do it

HANNAH
I want to be a lit agent

OTTO
Thats terrific But why I have
a hard enough time dealing with
myself I cant imagine having to
deal with ten of me on a daily
basis

HANNAH
I love writers The feeling of
bringing new art to the public eye
and helping artists realize their
dreams What could be better

HANNAH (CONTD)
Besides I like reading I need
more adventure in my life and
writers give me that

OTTO
I need less adventure in my life
Thats why I write about doing
things instead of actually doing
them
HANNAH

Assisting is alright But I want
better than alright I want GREAT

and two souls I have two eyes
that see two different sides of the
world I read two books at the
same time side by side and date
one girl while pining for another
I see two sides of every argument
I stare at menus for two hours
I’m too vain to be stingy but too
frugal to spend too I have two
personalities one too light and
one too dark they’re too strong to
agree too much and too head strong

My roommate at Exeter applied for a
job at the CIA - it’s the most
extensive background check you can
imagine They interview your
friends from middle school If you
so much as smoked weed in summer
camp you don’t get hired That’s
why the CIA is completely
ineffective it’s run by
uncreative rule-following Beaver

his Armani tie and rolls up his shirt sleeves He rolls his

Hannah regards him quizzically

Finally Otto raises his fists in a fighting stance He nods
to the circling thugs who ATTACK

In an amazing display of martial arts pleated Otto holds off
the storm of henchmen using the steel manacle to BLOCK AND
PARRY the lethal swipes of SWITCH BLADES and IRON PIPES

As the TYPEWRITER KEYS CLACK frustrated thugs LEAP after
Otto and Hannah only to have WHIRRING METAL SAW BLADES and
STEAMING HOT GLUE PRESSING MACHINES gruesomely materialize at
the last possible instant

Otto and Hannah dive and roll through MASSIVE CARPET MATTING

And suddenly all is quiet Otto and Hannah GASP FOR BREATH
The warehouse floor is now littered with unconscious bodies

Hannah is stunned

HANNAH
I drink when I’m under pressure

She takes a pull from a hip flask and grits her teeth Then
she drags long and hard on the cigarette

Hannah notices Ottos stare and begrudgingly offers him the
flask

HANNAH (CONTD)
Want a squirt

Otto stands slack-jawed in amazement

The cluttered warehouse office is dominated by exposed
dangerous-looking furnace equipment Hazard signs adorn gas
pipes DANGER - FLAMMABLE
HANNAH
Weve gotten this far Well find

Behind Big Neds oak desk is an office safe locked tight

OTTO

Hannah reaches into the safe and produces BRICK AFTER BRICK
OF HEROIN

OTTO

tell everyone

Hannah shakes her head in shock and nervously stuffs the
heroin back into the safe

HANNAH
Alright Im agreeing with you We

Hannah and Otto rifle through mounds of papers and bills on
Big Neds desk At last Hannah grabs a frayed stack of
typed pages and holds them in the air with triumph

OTTO
My manuscript Youre an angel

Hannah tucks the pages under her arm

HANNAH
Time to go

BIG NED (0S)
Dont move I want to remember you

Otto and Hannah slowly turn around arms raised in the air

BIG NED (CONTD)

Big Ned and a menacing HENCHMAN step into the room

BIG NED

OTTO

Hannah flicks her lighter from her pocket holds the pages
high in the air and LIGHTS THEM ON FIRE

HANNAH (CONTD)
(to Big Ned)
You want ‘em come and get

Hannah twists a dial on one of the exposed gas pipes and
tosses the lit bundle of pages toward the screaming BURST OF
GAS

BIG NED
No

Big Ned LUNGES TO SHUT THE FIRE-SPITTING GAS VALVE his
flunky pulling him back to safety

Hannah jerks her manacle dragging the slack-jawed Otto
toward the window

HANNAH

The gas tanks CATCH FIRE as Hannah pulls Otto toward the
window Big Ned drops his gun and races for a fire
extinguisher

EXT WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

-Otto grips the window ledge white-knuckled with terror
Hannah points to a MOVING FORK-LIFT

OTTO
No way

HANNAH
Hurry

HANNAH LEAPS FOR THE FORKLIFT Otto dragged along by his
manacle

Inside the GAS TANKS EXPLODE

Otto and Hannahs feet sail through the air and TOUCH DOWN ON
THE FORKLIFT They scramble and LEAP FOR A SECOND FORKLIFT
As the warehouse BELCHES FIRE Hannah and Otto leap onto a
mountain of rolled carpets

They flop from Persian to Persian down the pile and roll
onto the asphalt ground as peacefully as rolling into bed

Otto and Hannah scramble to a safe distance as new explosions
ROCK THE BUILDING ABOVE

Otto and Hannah collapse on pavement in each others arms

OTTO
Oh my God That was completely
messed up Are you alright
Youre burning

Hannahs skirt is ON FIRE Otto SMACKS at her legs and butt
BEATING out the flames He continues to pat and grope after
the flames have been extinguished

HANNAH
Alright thank you That’s enough
thank you

OTTO
Right

Ashes lilt gently to the ground like falling snow

OTTO (CONTD)
Well you said you like writers
because they bring more adventure
to your life

Hannah is covered in ashes she picks bits of charred dry
wall from her hair

OTTO (CONTD)
Are you alright Are you alright

HANNAH
Ive been kidnapped set on fire
and thrown out a window

Hannah grins broadly Sirens sound in the distance

HANNAH (CONTD)
Im better than alright Im
GREAT

Hannah pulls Otto into a kiss Fiery and passionate Otto
is AMAZED

The fire rages from the office windows sending plumes of
smoke into the sky WAILING FIRE TRUCKS AND POLICE CARS
surround the warehouse

OTTO
You blew up my landlords building

Otto and Hannah watch a dazed Big Ned SPRINT from the
building cradling an arm load of heroin bricks Ned runs
smack into a squadron of police officers spilling bricks
everywhere

The surprised officers tackle Big Ned to the ground
HANNAH
I think were off the hook for that

one

Firemen surround the flames police officers chase down the
coughing HENCHMEN who stumble from the smokey building

OTTO
We should probably get out of here
before were noticed

HANNAH
Second that

Another EXPLOSION rocks the complex Shards of debris STRIKE
the ground around them

Otto looks up at the warehouse wistfully
OTTO
My book All that work up in
smoke Well thats that I guess

Hannah looks at Otto and looks up at the building The whole
top floor is engulfed in flames

HANNAH
Well it’s a good thing I’ve got the
pages

OTTO

Hannah pulls the manuscript from her jacket
HANNAH

Otto slowly grins He cant stop staring at the check in his
hands

INT ELEVATOR - DAY
Otto waits for the elevator doors to close For the first
time we see him smiling and confident Without his glasses

At the last moment before the doors shut the real life
Hannah steps into the elevator

OTTO
Hannah
HANNAH
Oh hi

Hannah in a sharp blazer is dressed professionally now
She reaches to tap the close door button but pauses

HANNAH
Youre not going to freak out in

OTTO
(grinning)

Hannah fishes a cigarette out of her purse thinks better of
it and puts the cigarettes away

OTTO (CONTD)
Been a long day

HANNAH

directions but this was the best
possible version

OTTO

Otto still holds his paycheck in his hands beaming with
confidence
