1 EXT THE STAMPEDE TRAIL - DAY

SUPER
Tuesday April 28th 1992

WIDE-SHOT A vast snow-blanketed wilderness that sits
beneath the icy summits of the highest mountain range in
North America This is BIG Alaska

A beat up 4x4 pick-up enters very small into the upper
left corner of frame on an unkept snow-packed road and
comes to a stop A figure exits the passenger side and
moves around the front of the truck We can just make
out the rifle sticking out of his backpack We HEAR a
very distant Thank You as the figure walks away from
the road and away from the truck seemingly into nowhere

DRIVER
Hey

The figure with backpack and rifle henceforth BACKPACK
stopping in his tracks turns around in the direction of
the truck

DRIVER (CONTD)
Come here

BACKPACK walks back to the truck As he approaches the
drivers door we

CUT IN TO TIGHT SHOT over the back-packed shoulder onto
the DRIVER
DRIVER (CONTD)
(referring to items we see
sitting on dashboard)
You left your watch your comb your
change

We STAY on the DRIVER as BACKPACK speaks

BACKPACK
Keep it

DRIVER
I dont want your money And I already
have a watch

BACKPACK
If you dont take it Im gonna throw it
away I dont want to know what time it

is what day it is or where I am
(MORE)

BACKPACK (CONTD)
I dont want to see anybody None of
that matters

The driver reaches behind the seat of the truck pulls
out an old pair of rubber work boots

DRIVER
(handing him the boots)
Take em

There is a pause as Backpack considers accepting the
boots

DRIVER (CONTD)
If you make it out alive give me a call
and Ill tell you how to get the boots
back to me

We can feel over Backpacks shoulder that he has taken
the boots and is putting them on but we STAY on the
driver

BACKPACK
Hey do me a favor will ya Take a
picture of me

Backpack hands him an Instamatic camera and starts
walking backwards We PULL BACK with him And he
maintains his back to us When he stops we CONTINUE
until he is FULL-FRAME head-to-toe from behind posing

CUT TO
CU driver
CLICK He snaps the shot
Backpack re-enters frame in an OVER-SHOULDER Driver
hands him the camera
DRIVER
You gonna be alright
BACKPACK
Ill be better than that
(Ill be who I am)
As Backpack exits the frame we SLOWLY ZOOM past the
concerned face of the driver onto the loose change the
comb and the watch on the dash

Throughout the ZOOM the SOUND of FOOTSTEPS CRUNCHING THE
SNOW FADE into the distance

BACK TO
ORIGINAL WIDE-SHOT

We see the small form of the truck and the smaller form
of the Backpacker walking away from the truck until the
Backpacker has exited the frame The truck takes a BEAT
turns around in the snow and accelerates back into the
direction from which it came As the truck exits frame

DAY

SUPER
May 1990

The crowd of family and friends and of course students
Assembled on fold-out chairs The broad lawn
INTERCUT CHRIS MCCANDLESS We dont see his face just
feet pounding the pavement at an increasing pace

One by one the names of graduates announced Their
bright young faces capped heads and gowns glide up to
the podium to accept their diplomas

INTERCUT Chris on his run sweatshirt hood over head
Amongst assembled crowd and family we find THE
MCCANDLESS BILLIE mid to late forties with dark
striking eyes WALT a taciturn man early fifties and
CARINE eighteen pretty with her mothers eyes and waist
length brown hair a gold crucifix dangles from her neck
They look around looking for Chris hes nowhere in
sight

INTERCUT Chris in a shower (PHOTO-SONICS) He TURNS INTO
CAMERA the water streaming down his face

From the announcement podium comes the name of their son
and brother CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS The
McCandless family increasingly panicked over Chris
absence when almost magically he appears in full cap
and gown

Disregarding the steps that lead up to the podium
platform the small-framed but athletic CHRIS MCCANDLESS
leaps jubilantly onto the stage in a single bound
frightening Billie a little wince from Walt and Carine
Thats our Chris And just as quickly as Chris has

been handed his diploma he civilly descends the platform
steps

TIME CUT

SLO-MO A ballet of graduation caps float upward into a
frame of blue sky We HEAR Chris voice OVER this image
as we intermittently cut away from the caps against the
sky to focus on his parents

(HIGH ANGLE floating caps in FOREGROUND Walt and Billie
delight upon the caps) An outer glee in sharp contrast
to voice over

CHRIS (VO)
I see them standing at the formal gates
of their colleges
I see my father strolling out
under the ochre sandstone arch the

red tiles glinting like bent

plates of blood behind his head

I see my mother with a few light books at
her hip

standing at the pillar made of tiny
bricks with the

wrought-iron gate still open behind her
its

sword-tips black in the May air

they are about to graduate they are
about to get married

they are kids they are dumb all they
know is they are

innocent they would never hurt anybody
I want to go up to them and say Stop
dont do it--shes the wrong woman

hes the wrong man you are going to do
things

you cannot imagine you would ever do
you are going to do bad things to

children

you are going to suffer in ways you never
heard of

you are going to want to die I want to
go

up to them there in the late May sunlight
and say it
her hungry pretty blank face turning to
me

CHRIS (VO) (CONTD)
her pitiful beautiful untouched body
his arrogant handsome blind face turning
to me
his pitiful beautiful untouched body
but I dont do it I want to live I
take them up like the male and female
paper dolls and bang them together
at the hips like chips of flint as if to
strike sparks from them I say

OVER Chris shoulder he frisbees his graduation cap from
the upstairs window to his parents parting Cadillac on

As they wave goodbye Carine catches the cap from the
backseat window And with a parting smile to her
brother she poses with it on her own head Chris smiles

something other than sadness

In a warm ambient light we SEE a black and white poster
on a barren wall Poncho-clad Clint Eastwood from The

We TILT DOWN a stack of books sitting on the floor -
Tolstoy Stegner Thoreau Jack London and Pasterna
Beside them a campers backpack

Chris sits in introspection at his desk by candlelight
The room is spare supporting his monkish lifestyle But
on the desk before him he counts out 50068 from a bank
envelope He pockets those bills and change then removes
a check for 24000 made out to OXFAM America from the
same bank envelope He scribbles a note These are all

my savings Feed someone with it Signed Chris

pre-addressed Oxford Famine Relief Fund (in Boston)

He pulls his wallet from his back pocket Pulls all the

towns and open highways landscapes and landmarks days
and nights that lead to the Mojave desert in the West

(In contrast to his introspection of the previous night
Chris is buoyant throughout this sequence)

VEGAS NEVADA - SUNSET

(CRANE SHOT) We see Chris stop the Datsun in the middle
of the desert road We (CRANE) DOWN to a close-up
through the windshield Chris looks left Then right
Into the rearview mirror and suddenly turns the wheel
veering the Datsun off the paved highway into the vast
desert

As we CRANE back UP the Datsun moves into the horizon

END PRESENTATION TITLES FADE MUSIC

11 EXT DETRITAL WASH - TWILIGHT 11
ANGLE WEST-FACING
The Datsun sits in the magical pastel twilight just
before darkness slides over the desert It is positioned

at the foot of a wash wall that edges the soup bowl

ANGLE EAST-FACING

The Datsun a yellow speck in the frame Coyotes yap at
the moon Other than that no sound on the desert floor

In the distance voluptuous cumulonimbus clouds boil
upward catching the last rosy glow of the west-setting
sun over the rim of the upper Detrital watershed

We see strobe bursts of lightning followed by muffled
thunder illuminating the thunder clouds from within
Short SERIES OF ANGLES as we MOVE IN on the distant
gullies and ravines starting to run with copious amounts
of water

INT DATSUN - NIGHT 12

Chris McCandless in the same clothes he had been in back
in the rooming house sleeps in the back seat of the
Datsun His head supported by his backpack We begin to
HEAR a rumble But this rumble is not thunder It

rapidly builds into an alarming ROAR The roar grows to

a deafening level Chris awakens

As he peeks up from the backseat looking forward through
the windshield he just barely catches sight of the
leading edge of a flash flood A four-foot high wall of
water mud and debris makes impact with the Datsun
momentarily enveloping it in water Suddenly the car is
SLAMMED against the cliff CRACK Chris sits upright
disoriented

POV As far as the eye can see in the desert moonlight
water has taken over the desert with a flash flood

However theres no panic in Chris face as we observe
him past a new crack in the wet windshield The water
while violent seems to have topped off just above the
wheels Chris gets a slight smile on his face as the
car settles into its new position below the cliff He
returns to sleep

EXT DESERT - DAY 13

What remains of Chris travelling money burns in a pile
beside the Datsun on the sun-lit but muddy desert floor

We follow a very long set of footprints (CAMERA
TRACKINGTRUE VERTICAL) away from the burning cash
through the mud finally tilting up to the footprint
maker Chris Slogging toward high ground

WIDE-SHOT We see the abandoned Datsun nearly a mile
behind Chris as he walks toward us wearing his backpack
He comes very close to camera (only a day or twos
stubble on his face) and as we PAN him 180 we see as
much wilderness before us as we did behind

Chris McCandless speaking to camera holds a microphone in
a shadowy room doing his Geraldo Rivera Its tongue-in-
cheek at best

CHRIS
This is Emory University freshman Chris
McCandless reporting from the vault at
Thompson Hall

He indicates a hatchway in the floor leading to a
brightly lit corridor below

CHRIS (CONTD)
We have just dynamited the hatchway and
are the first human beings to step foot
into this vault in over a hundred years
Somewhere in here lies the secret of the
great beast within us all A beast built
on lies corruption and greed

We HEAR a GROWLING SOUND from behind Chris

CHRIS (CONTD)
And there it is The legendary beast
Mocra

CAMERA quickly PANS to a blanket-wrapped crawling FELLOW
STUDENT in a grotesque Halloween mask

We MOVE INTO CU on the monster growling
QUICK PAN back to Chris

CHRIS (CONTD)
(in mock fright)
Weve got to get out of here quick and re-
secure the hatch while we make a plan of
how to kill the beast
CAMERA SHAKES all over like a bad horror film trying to
stay with Chris as he makes a quick escape down the
hatchway into the University dorm corridor

CLUMSY VIDEO TIME CUT Chris nailing the last nail in
the hatchway from below He climbs down the steps where
he exchanges his hammer for his microphone from an off-
camera source

CHRIS (CONTD)
Well it looks like weve succeeded -

We HEAR the monsters GROWL from above

CHRIS (CONTD)
- at least for the moment in sealing the
beast back into the vault Your humble
reporter Chris McCandless will now
struggle with the journalistic question
of ethics Will he retain his reporters
objectiveness or save the future of human
truth by slaying this awful beast

He gives us a look of vaudevillian puzzlement - what will
he do

CONTINUE VIDEO

We pick up with Chris in a corridor outside a door with a
cheap paper-and-tape label announcing the adjacent room
as the office of Ted Turner

CHRIS (CONTD)
Once again your humble reporter Chris
McCandless

We HEAR OS students commenting on Chris and his video
crew

OS STUDENT
What is this Filmmaking 101

deceit and greed within us all I must
slay it

TED TURNERSTUDENT

(worst acting weve ever

seen)
McCandless how many times have I had to
tell you Ive had to tell you that you
are a journalist and you cant get
personally involved in your casesor
your stories

CHRIS
Ted I know how to kill it And Im the
only one who knows You cant keep
sending me on stories and expecting me to
do nothing I look like some kind of an
idiot

TED TURNERSTUDENT

Behind Chris in the corridor outside Teds office a
PANICKED STUDENT arrives at the door

PANICKED STUDENT

monster is scratching at the hatchway
Hell be out in no time

TED TURNERSTUDENT

Itll mean your job Chris McCandless

CHRIS

Thats it Ted Fire me if you want but

this beast must be slayed
Microphone in hand Chris makes haste The CAMERA RUNS
WITH HIM out the door through the corridor up a set of
steps to the hatchway As he arrives the monster
appears above him in the hatchway crawl space having
pulled off the board Chris had nailed

CHRIS (CONTD)
(into camera)
This is the only thing that can kill the
monster Its gonna be risky but without
great risk there is no freedom So we
will now hear from the famous singer -
Chris McCandless

A piano is PUSHED INTO FRAME beside Chris A YOUNG BLACK
STUDENT pulls a stool in front of the piano and begins to
play Chris begins to serenade the monster
intermittently sharing the serenade directly into camera
as well He bursts into an uninhibited solo of Tender Is
The Night

CAMERA TILTS UP to the monster looking out the hatchway
slowly dying from the song being sung

As the song continues to be sung and the monster
continues to die the AUDIO RECEDES and VIDEO IMAGES GO

CARINE (VO)
When we were little Chris was very to
himself He wasnt anti-social he
always had friends and everybody liked
him - but he could go off and entertain
himself for hours he didnt seem to need
toys or friends He could be alone
without being lonely The secrets our
parents kept though unknown to Chris and
I led to bouts of rage and even violence
between them that we had been forced to
witness since we were very young It
seemed like they never fought without us
I remember the first family meeting to
let Chris and me in on their plans for

getting a divorce They wanted us to
hoose which of them wed live with I
ried my eyes out But the divorce never
appened though the threats and meetings
ever stopped It wasnt long before
hris and I shut off -- we would tell mom
nd dad to go ahead and get the divorce
hris and I just wanted to get away from
heir fights and mom kept promising to
et out and take us with her as soon as
heir company made enough money Dad had
been the young genius that NASA
enlisted to do crucial designs for the
American satellite radar systems that
would be our answer to the Russian
Sputnik And mom and he later started up
a consulting firm combining her get-up-
and-go resourcefulness with his wealth of
knowledge By the time the company
actually made its first million the
careerism and money seemed to erase her
memory of the promise shed made us

addressing Chris

FOREST RANGER
Youre not the character who knocked down

No

Because there was a sign indicating that
camping was allowed by permit only

CHRIS

after a group of rare flower hunters
stumbled upon it in the desert There
were no signs that Chris had intended to
return to it But there wasnt any

Dad you and I have had our differences
over the yearsbut on your birthday I
want to tell you how grateful I am for
all the things youve given me And that
you did it starting from nothing to
working your way through college and
busting your ass to support us kids So

The day after the party Chris left on
his trip and ended up staying away most
of the summer It was nearly three months
before he walked back into our house in
Annandale He had a scruffy beard his
hair was long and tangled and he was
rail thin As soon as I heard he was
home I ran into his room to talk to him
In California hed looked up some old
family friends who still lived there
Hed found out that long after he had
been born our dad had continued a
relationship with his first wife Marcia
in secret

Chris was quiet when he told me this He
said it made his entire childhood seem
like a fiction that the truth had been
dying everyday If something bothered
Chris hed usually keep it to himself
And he made me promise to do the same

(MORE )

CARINE (CONTD)
He never did tell mom and dad that he
knew But Chris measured himself and
those around him by an impossibly
rigorous moral code He loathed what he
considered mom and dads hypocrisy and
resented what they considered guidance
Chris submitted to dads authority
through college but I knew he raged
inwardly the whole time It was
inevitable that Chris would rebel And
when he did he did it with
characteristic immoderation

Walt suddenly collapses to his knees weeping heartbroken
and ashamed on a quiet Annandale street in the shadowless
light of dusk

made some terrible mistakes And to some
extent it seemed Chris was making him

CARINE (VO)

In the nine months since Chris

disappearance my parents went through

enormous changes Guilt was giving way

to pain And pain seemed to bring them

closer My father had humbled

dramatically And what had always been a

sort of curt arrogance the kind of man

who actually thought he could cancel

Christmas had given way to the

vulnerability of a fathers heart Even

their faces had changed It made me sad

that I couldnt share with Chris the new

closeness I felt toward our parents

CHRIS
How old are you Mr Franz

RON
Seventy-nine years old

CHRIS
Seventy-ninesee all due respect but
the real difference between people is the
quality of their soul and not on how long
theyve trudged around like a dip-shit

Ron laughs

CHRIS (CONTD)
But its true

RON
It is No question about that

Ron continues to let Chris vent
CHRIS

The governments the same as my parents
They dont respect anybody Regulation
Regulation Regulation WE cant do

this But THEY can do that I mean the
hypocrisy of the wholeculture Makes
me crazy My father was having children

with two women at the same time and then

has the gall to think that he can be of
some guidance to me Make judgments on
me My mother of course goes along
with all of it Keeps the secret which
of course makes my whole life a fiction
Everything I thought was wasnt

Theyre such fools Fucking idiots

RON
Alex please dont lump me in amongst
your judges And your tyrants But Id
prefer to not hear that kind of language
CHRIS
(realizing his slip)
Sorry I dont usually use that kind of

Cheers

RON
I spent most of my life in the army On
New Years Eve 1957 I was stationed over
in Okinawa My wife and son were here in
the States just driving down the road
when a fellow whod had too much to drink
plowed right into them Killed them
both Anyway you might think that the
last thing in the world Id do is go to
the whiskey but at the time it felt
like the only thing I could do And I
did it hard But pretty soon I figured
I wasnt doing my wife and son any good
mourning them with a bottle So I
pulled myself together and quit drinking
cold turkey And then

Ron spinning his body around points to the photographs
over the sink

much me

(indicating his small

I could ask you the same question
Except I already know the answer

RON
You do do you

CHRIS
I do Mr Franz Youve got to get back
out in the world Get out of that lonely
house of yours that little workshop
and go live on the road

Ron waves him off

CHRIS (CONTD)
Really Youre going to live a long
time Ron You should make a radical
change in your lifestyle The core of
mans spirit comes with new experiences
And there you are stubborn old man
sitting on your butt

Ron after taking one more deep breath sits up and Chris
sits next to him Hes actually pretty happy with
himself He looks out and sees the distant Salton Sea

RON
Im going to miss you when you go

CHRIS
Ill miss you too Ron But youre wrong
if you think the joy of life comes
principally from human relationships
Gods placed it all around us Its in
everything In anything we can
experience People just have to change
the way they think about those things
You ought to put a little camper on the
back of your pick-up and go take a look
at some of the great work gods done out
here in the American west
RON
AlexYoure probably right And Im
going to take stock of that

Chris offers a skeptical glance

A second skeptical glance Which Ron squashes with
genuine sincerity

something with Ron

loveGods light shines on you

In the trees beside the river we find Chris The river
is not yet in sight but Chris starts to HEAR it A
building rumble

As Chris exits the treeline there she is The Teklanika
at full flood Seventy-five foot wide banks replacing
the narrow ice canal of four months earlier Snowmelt
from glaciers high in the Alaska range its opaque
glacial sediment the color of wet concrete And what had
been a distant rumble in the woods now had the volume
and power of a freight train a seventy-five foot wide
one

Chris grabs a hold of a riverside branch and takes one
slow careful step into the river Without mercy WHAM
the river kicks his feet out from under him The branch
he holds SNAPS By some miracle his hands move like
lightening and he grabs a lower sturdier branch below
saving himself from a certain death

We SEE the broken branch catapulted down river and into a
rocky shoot below He pulls himself back onto the bank
drops his pack at riverside and eases to a sitting
position beside it

Chris stumbles to the door of the bus looking up at the
hot sun He has to sit back down on the small bus steps
From his position on the step he leans back into the bus
and is able to grab his water jug He pours it into his
mouth but nothing seems to satiate or hydrate him He
drinks it all It spills over his face and chest

We observe Chris for a moment as the wheels turn inside
his haunted eyes And a curiosity seems to overtake him
He crawls back to his copy of Tanaina Plantlore flipping
the pages one by one until he arrives at the photograph
identifying the wild potato root and the word edible
beside it He reads the page to its conclusion and as
almost an afterthought turns the page to see if there
might be more

The word -
POISON

jumps off the page at him

The book describes the tiny green seeds of the potato
root and warns that those with

lateral veins such as those invisible on the leaflets of
wild sweet peas are poisonous

leading to partial motor paralysis

A SUBTLE DRUM (HEART)BEAT BEGINS OVER

Chris plops himself down into the middle of the bus He
shakes his head as if trying to say something and then
considers his rifle and abundant ammunition But taking
his own life to avoid the agony of starvation is not an
option for him No no no dont do this to me The
frustration builds enough adrenaline in him to scream
out

He does but with a low gurgled animal sound He shakes
it off and looks to his copy of Doctor Zhivago for
distraction Thumbing through the pages he focuses his
eyes on the page -

ANGLE The page what he reads
CHRIS (V0) (OC)
And that an unshared happiness is not

happiness

Chris steals his pencil from within the pages of the
book scribbling across the page
CHRIS (V0) (0C)
(CONTD)
HAPPINESS ONLY REAL WHEN SHARED

He flips backwards a couple of pages to where he had
written the quote

CHRIS (VO) (0C)
(CONTD)
CALL EVERYTHING BY ITS RIGHT NAME

He tears the back cover off the book and scratching the
pencil across its blank side writing these words
quickly as if in panic

I HAVE HAD A HAPPY LIFE AND THANK THE LORD GOODBYE AND
MAY GOD BLESS ALL

And now these words arrive slowly as we HEAR Chris
repeating
CHRIS (0C) (CONTD)
(with a weak voice)
Call everything by its right name

The drumbeat increases as he signs the note
CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS

We move from the page back up to Chris We see that he
has put on his eyeglasses to strengthen the vision of his
weakening sight He removes them folds them and lays
them by his side His body begins to tremble His eyes
dance wildly

The drumming intensifies

Chris takes one last look out the window The sun is
covered by a well-defined and puffy cloud

His arm nearing spasm reaches up to the bunk grasping at
the blue sleeping bag made by his mother

With great suffering and shattering trembles he forces
his body to defy its agony and pushes it into the
sleeping bag

SKYWARD the cloud obscuring the sun

Drumbeats ESCALATE - BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM

TOTAL SILENCE

Chris looking at the sky a cathartic tear falls from his
left eye Another from his right as the obscuring cloud
clears the sun

Chris The LAST AIRY EXPULSION OF HIS BREATH

His open face as the clearing light of the sun shines in
his eyes It is a face of peace love a face of true
deep serenity

The eyes joyously open and the corners of his mouth ease
into the subtle smile of euphoric wisdom

Thats the way he settles to stillness looking directly
into our camera

And he died alive
He made it He lived He loved

Cat Stevens Miles from Nowhere plays OVER

As we PULL AWAY from Chris face through the bus window
and up into the sky -

We drift further and further away above the stunted
trees and the shimmering roof of the bus like a tiny
white gleam in a wild green sea grows smaller and
smaller

REPRISE IMAGE of truck driver taking picture of Chris in
scene 1

Then its him

The smiling STILL IMAGE we saw taken in the first scene
from behind but now we are seeing it from the front and
it is the image of the real Christopher McCandless on the
edge of the Stampede Trail As it takes over the screen
we ZOOM SLOWLY into his smiling face And then these
words appear superimposed over it
Dedicated to the memory of Christopher Johnson McCandless
February 12 1968 - August 18th 1992

As those words dissolve these words appear

On September 19 1992 Carine McCandless flew with her
brothers ashes from Alaska home to the eastern seaboard
She carried them with her on the planein her backpack
