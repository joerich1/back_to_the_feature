From a BLACK SCREEN
--we’re in the middle of a confidential conversation

ANDY (VO)
The screen says it’s an
unimplemented trap but the dialogue
box is wrong it’s a system error

JOANNA (VO)
When did it happen

ANDY (VO)
About 10 minutes ago we’ve been
working it

JOANNA (VO)
An unimplemented trap

ANDY (VO)
It’s a system error

INT AUDITORIUM - MORNINGCONTINUOUS 1

We’1ll get our bearings in a moment but right now we’re in the
middle of a conversation taking place on a stage between
STEVE JOBS JOANNA HOFFMAN and ANDY HERTZFELD--all late-
20’searly 30s

JOANNA
So what’s the upshot
ANDY
It’s not gonna say “Hello”
STEVE
It absolutely is gonna say “Hello”
ANDY
It’s nobody’s fault (it’s a system
error)
STEVE
(over)

You built the voice demo

ANDY

ANDY

STEVE
How bad are you saying

ANDY
It’s pretty bad

STEVE
I don’t know what that means

ANDY
It means (the demo is more than
likely gonna crash)

JOANNA
(over)
You have to keep your voices down
Joel Pforzheimer is sitting out in
the house

STEVE
I don’t care if--who’s Joel
Pforzheimer

JOANNA
GQ He’s been shadowing you for a
week did you notice

STEVE
Alright

JOANNA
Just look like everything’s fine
he’s sitting out in the house

We reveal the 2600 seat house which in 40 minutes will be
filled to capacity We’re at the launch of the Mac
STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915 4

There are hundreds of seats with “Reserved For” signs on them
for the various Apple teams--Macintosh” “Apple II” “Lisa”--
as well as hundreds of members of the press--”New York

Times” “Newsweek” “Wall Street Journal” “Financial Times

of London” “Le Monde” etc JOEL PFORZHEIMER is out there
credentials around his neck and he gives a small wave to
Steve and so are 50 or 60 ENGINEERS DESIGNERS and MARKETERS
who are observing the rehearsal from various vantage points

Way in the back is CHRISANN BRENNAN 31 and her daughter
LISA BRENNAN 5 who’s tucked in a big coat

STEVE JOANNA and ANDY are standing in front of a giant
screen showing a slide of the Mac JOANNA is a beautiful
brilliant dryly-funny Polish immigrant who speaks with a
slight trace of an accent ANDY is a sweet cherubic young
guy--if you put a bow and arrow in his hands he’d look like
Cupid Nobody has slept for days

STEVE
(to ANDY)
Alright what are your guys saying

ANDY
Some kind of race condition but we
havent been able to track it down

yet

STEVE
Is the synthesizer sampling fast
enough

ANDY

No so the rates are off and it
keeps crashing

JOANNA
(to STEVE)
It’s 20 seconds out of a two-hour
launch why not just cut it

STEVE
We can’t cut it

JOANNA
Yeah you just (cut it)

STEVE
(over)
Two days ago we ran a Super Bowl ad
that could’ve won the Oscar for
Best Short Film
(MORE )
STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915 5

STEVE (CONTD)
There are more people who can tell
you about the ad than can tell you
who won the game

JOANNA
I understand but the ad said the
Mac was gonna save the world it
didn’t say it was gonna say hello

ANDREA CUNNINGHAM a 26-year-old publicist for Apple calls
from the back--

ANDREA
We’re gonna open the house in five

STEVE
(calling back to ANDREA)
Don’t open the house
(to the house)
Were taking a quick break

ANDY

Part of the problem is--
STEVE

--what
ANDY

We can recompile but if it’s a
hardware problem we can’t get into
the back

JOANNA
Why not

ANDY
(to STEVE)
You want to tell her or should I

STEVE
(to ANDY)
Don’t start with me man

JOANNA
Why can’t he get into the machine

ANDY
(to JOANNA)
You need special tools

JOANNA
What kind of special tools just
take a screwdriver
STEVE JOBS -

Shooting Script 031915

ANDY
He didn’t want users to be able to
open it you need special tools

JOANNA
(to STEVE)
Is this for real

STEVE
There are a hundred engineers
walking around here none of them
have the tools

ANDY
In fairness not many of them were
issued the tools

STEVE
What about you

ANDY shrugs--

ANDY
I left them at the office it was
3 AM and--

JOANNA
Oh Jesus Christ--cut “hello”
STEVE
No
JOANNA
What’s the first rule of a launch
STEVE
It’s not gonna crash
ANDY
It just did
STEVE
(calling out to the house)
Andy
ANDY
Which one
STEVE

The other Andy you’re right there
why would I (be calling out into--)
STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915 7

JOANNA
He needs to talk to you

ANDREA CUNNINGHAM the 26-year-old publicist calls back--

ANDREA
Yeah

STEVE
(to ANDREA)
The exit signs have to be off or
we’re not gonna get a full
blackout

ANDREA
Weve spoken to the building
manager and the fire marshal

STEVE
And

ANDREA
There’s absolutely no way they’re
letting us turn the exit signs off

STEVE
I’1l pay whatever the fine is

ANDREA
The fine is they’re gonna come in
and tell everyone to leave

STEVE
You explained to the fire marshal
that we’re in here changing the
world

ANDREA
I did but unless we can also
change the properties of fire he
doesn’t care

JOANNA
Steve--

STEVE
If a fire causes a stampede to the
unmarked exits it will have been
well worth it for those who
survive For those who don’t less
so but still pretty good
STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915 8

ANDREA
Listen--

STEVE

(still to ANDREA)
I need it to go to black real
black get rid of the exit signs
and don’t let me know how you did
it

(to ANDY)
Fix the voice demo

STEVE leaves the stage followed by JOANNA and heads--

INT BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

JOANNA
You need special tools to open the
Mac

STEVE

You knew it was a closed system

JOANNA
I didn’t know literally Jesus

JOANNA opens a door marked “STEVE JOBS” and gives STEVE a
push into--

INT STEVE’S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The room’s been set aside as a place for Steve to chill be
alone and prepare during rehearsals and before the big
presentation

There’s a Mac (the original Mac) on a small table

There’s also a large unopened carton that was recently
delivered

JOANNA
And if you keep alienating people
for no reason there’s gonna be no
one left for it to say hello to

STEVE
It’s not for no reason We blow
this and IBM will own the next 50
years like a Batman villain
Remember the phone company
(MORE)
STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915

STEVE (CONTD)

That’s what Bell was called the
phone company IBM will be the
computer company and in 10 years
they’1l be the information company
and that’s very bad for the human
race so we don’t have time to be
polite or realistic ‘cause if we
are this company’s next product
launch will be held in front of 26
people and a stringer from the
Alameda County Shoppers Guide

JOANNA
We--listen--we haven’t advertised
the voice software We could pull
it out of the demo and no one would
be disappointed Do you want to try
being reasonable just you know to
see what it feels like

STEVE
Okay pull the voice demo

JOANNA
Thank you

STEVE
And then cancel the launch

JOANNA
I see you just (tricked me a
little)

STEVE
over)
You can tell me how unimportant it
is but if the computer doesn’t say
hello then neither will John
Sculley who I promise you agrees
with me

JOANNA
Sculley’s not gonna cancel the
launch ‘cause he’s not insane

STEVE
He’s also not a hack and when it
comes to the Macintosh he’s gonna
do what I ask him to do What is in
this box
STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915 10

JOANNA
Nothing you need to worry about
don’t even open it

STEVE opens the flaps on the box and pulls out an issue of
Time magazine “Machine of the Year” is on the cover with a
picture of a computer It’s a carton full of copies of Time

STEVE
pause)
What the fuck is--why is there a
carton of--who did this

JOANNA
Somebody thought--

STEVE
Who

JOANNA

--doesn’t matter--thought it would
be a good idea to have copies of
that Time cover available at
everyone’s seat It was nipped in
the bud and all the copies are
being taken out of the building--
they’re probably already out of the
building soproblem solved

STEVE
This isn’t a Macintosh

JOANNA
I understand

STEVE
Somebody thought it would be a good
idea to like enthusiastically
hand over copies of Time with a not-
a-Macintosh on the cover at the
launch of the Macintosh What are
they handing out at Hewlett-
Packard a bushel of apples with my
face on them

JOANNA
I’m sure the thinking was--

STEVE
Yeah
STEVE JOBS -

Shooting Script 031915

JOANNA
--that since the computer is Man of
the Year that that’s good for our
business but like I said I’m having
them removed from the building

STEVE
What I’d like you to do with them
is to take them all 2600 copies
and stack them on Kottke’s desk and
tell him Steve says “Happy New
Year to you”

JOANNA
Okay

STEVE
I gave Michael Moritz full access
the whole campus Bandley Apple
II Lisa I gave him Sculley
Markkula I gave him Woz I gave
him everybody Betrayal thy name
is Michael Moritz and Bozo thy
name is Daniel Kottke What should
I call the person who thought it
would be a good idea to hand these
out

JOANNA
I’m not telling you who it was it
was done without malice it’s been
taken care of you have a half-hour
and we have things to talk about

STEVE

Like what
JOANNA

Like a million in the first 90 days--
STEVE

Joanna-—
JOANNA

Twenty thousand a month after that
STEVE

Look--
JOANNA

I’m begging you--

STEVE JOBS -

Shooting Script 031915

STEVE
Those are the forecasts

JOANNA
--because this is my field I am
begging you to manage expectations
out there

STEVE
I’m fanning (expectations)

JOANNA
(over)
We’re not gonna sell a million in
the first 90 days

STEVE
Everyone everyone everyone
Everyone is waiting for the Mac

JOANNA
Maybe but what happens when they
find out that for twenty-four
ninety-five there’s nothing you can
do with it

STEVE stares at her

JOANNA (CONTD)
(pause)
We were competitive at 1500 but
once you replaced the Motorola 6809
with the 68000--

STEVE
--which is what supports menus
windows point and click high res
graphics--

JOANNA
Yeah ‘cause everyone needs
rectangles with rounded corners

STEVE
Coach lands on the runway at the
exact same time as first class

JOANNA
(beat)
I don’t have the first fucking idea
what that means but this is how it
got to 2500

STEVE JOBS -

Shooting Script 031915

STEVE
Okay--

JOANNA
Which is the price point on the PC
which can do a lot more

STEVE
Who’s gonna want a PC once--what
idiot is gonna want--if I need to
tell you there’s a spot on your
shirt I point to the spot I don’t
say there’s a spot 14 centimeters
down from the collar and 3
centimeters to the right of the
second button while I try to
remember what the command is for
club soda that’s not how a
person’s mind works

JOANNA
If the goal was ease of use maybe
you shouldve given it some memory

STEVE
You can complain about memory or
you can complain about price but
you can’t do both at the same time
Memory is what costs money And I’m
glad you’re telling me your
feelings about the Mac now because
we have a half-hour left we can
redesign it

JOANNA
I’m just asking you to (manage
expectations)

STEVE
(over)
Look at their faces when they see
what it is They won’t know what
they’re looking at or why they like
it but they’1l know they want it

JOANNA
Not instantly When people heard
“Rite of Spring they tore the
chairs out of the theater they
didn’t buy the record

STEVE JOBS -

Shooting Script 031915

STEVE
“Rite of Spring happens to be the
most revolutionary and provocative
symphony of the last century

JOANNA
Yes exactly but Igor Stravinsky
didn’t say he was gonna sell 20000
units a month

STEVE
It was 1913 there weren’t--I don’t
know why we’re talking about
Stravinsky when--
(holding up Time)
--I’ve been properly sodomized by
Dan Kottke in Time magazine

JOANNA
Look obviously--let me say this--
obviously Daniel didn’t think he
was doing anything wrong

STEVE

By talking to Moritz about it
JOANNA

Yeah
STEVE

What does that mean

JOANNA
You said--when you told me the
story you said “Dan did Michael
Moritz ask you if I had a daughter
named Lisa” and Dan said “Yeah”
and you said “What did you tell
him” and Dan said “Yes” My point
was that he answered you simply and
honestly because he didn’t think
he’d done anything wrong

STEVE
(pause)
Except Joanna except--I dont
have a daughter named Lisa
(beat--picking up the
magazine)
And this story is now about how I’m
denying paternity and took a blood
test
(MORE)

STEVE JOBS -

Shooting Script 031915

STEVE (CONTD)

And that’s why there’s a picture of
a--I don’t know what the fuck that
is--that’s why there’s a picture of
a PC on the cover instead of a
picture of me and the Mac

(beat)
I don’t know what to tell you I
was supposed to be Time magazines
Man of the Year and then Dan Kottke
was born

JOANNA
(beat)

Well

STEVE
What

JOANNA
She’s waiting for you

STEVE

JOANNA
Chrisann

STEVE

JOANNA

They’re out in the hall They’ve
been sitting in the back of the
auditorium since seven this
morning she wants to talk to you

STEVE
How did she get in

JOANNA
Who was gonna stop her

STEVE
I’m not having a session with her
right now

JOANNA
We issued 335 press credentials for
the launch Steve you piss off
Chrisann and she’s gonna stand in
the lobby and give 335 interviews
and you pal will be longing for
the halcyon days of Dan Kottke

STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915

STEVE
(pause)
Lemme get this over with But don’t
leave you’re gonna stay here

JOANNA
I’m not

STEVE
No there’s less chance of a scene

JOANNA
I find this all excruciatingly
personal and I’m not staying

STEVE
I don’t want to be in a room alone
with Chrisann Come on this is me
and you

JOANNA
Fine

STEVE goes to the door opens it and steps out into--

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

LISA

LISA

(pointing to the top of an
imaginary globe)

LISA
(to JOANNA)
My dad named a computer after me

STEVE
I’m not your--

STEVE stops himself and sees the looks coming from both
CHRISANN and JOANNA

STEVE (CONT’D)

(pause)
That actually--do you know what a
coincidence is Lisa Like if you
met someone if you made a new
friend and her name was Lisa too
that would be a coincidence Lisa
stands for “Local Integrated System
Architecture” L-I-S-A It’s a
coincidence

JOANNA
(pause)
You about done

STEVE
Yeah
JOANNA
(to LISA)
Come Let’s make that computer say
hi

LISA’s still absorbing the “Lisa” information

STEVE JOBS -

Shooting Script 031915

CHRISANN
Go ahead Lisa

LISA
So it was the other way around--I
was named after the computer

STEVE
Nothing was named after anybody
it’s a coincidence

JOANNA
Come on hon

JOANNA and LISA exit

CHRISANN
What’s the matter with you

STEVE
What’s the matter with you Why
are you telling her these things
Why are you still telling her I’m

CHRISANN
A judge told her youre her father--

STEVE
No he didn’t

CHRISANN
--and where the hell do you get off
telling Time magazine that I’ve
slept with 28 of the men in
America

STEVE
That’s not remote--

CHRISANN

CHRISANN
(picking up the magazine)
It’s right here

STEVE JOBS -

Shooting Script 031915

STEVE (CONTD)
I believe it’s a training facility
for paid assassins

CHRISANN
“Jobs insists”--I’m quoting--

STEVE
I didn’t invent math

CHRISANN
28 of the male population of the
United States could be the
father’”

STEVE
I wasn’t saying you’ve slept with
28 of American men I was using an
algorithm based on the blood test
which said there was a 941 chance
that I’m the father

CHRISANN
Youre trying to publicly paint me
as a slut and a whore

STEVE
Believe me I’m not trying to
publicly do anything with you

CHRISANN
Two-million people read Time how
am (I supposed to--)

STEVE
(over)
It would’ve been more if they’d put
me on the cover but Dan Kottke
(decided to kidney punch me and--)

CHRISANN
(over--stopping him)
I applied for welfare yesterday

STEVE
I’m sorry

CHRISANN
I said I applied for welfare
yesterday The Time article said
your Apple stock is worth 441
million dollars And I wanted to
ask you how you felt about that

STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915 21

STEVE
WellI feel like Apple stock is
being dramatically undervalued
This would be a good time to get

in
CHRISANN
Your daughter and her mother are on
welfare
STEVE
Chrisann--
CHRISANN

We’re living in a hovel in Menlo
Park We can’t pay the heating
bills she sleeps in a parka Your

CHRISANN
Because as reported by Time

CHRISANN
--all of them exactly nine months

ANDY
No It’s got a one in six chance of
working

STEVE
Goddammit

It should be noted there are a number of people--YOUNG
ENGINEERS--standing around and witnessing Steve beat up Andy

ANDY
We’re not a pit crew at Daytona
this can’t be fixed in seconds

STEVE
You didn’t have seconds you had
three weeks The universe was
created in a third of that time

ANDY
Well someday you’1l have to tell us
how you did it
STEVE JOBS -

Shooting Script 031915 23

JOANNA can’t help a smile and small laugh STEVE looks at

her

STEVE
Here’s what I’m going to do I’m
going to announce the names of
everyone who designed the launch
demo--I’m gonna introduce everyone
and ask them to stand up The bag
was designed by Susan Kare the
Macintosh font that’s scrolling
across the screen was designed by
Steve Capps the starry night and
the skywriting was Bruce Horn
MacPaint MacWrite Alice down to
the calculator and then I’m going
to say the voice demo that didn’t
work was designed by Andy
Hertzfeld

ANDY laughs a little for a moment but STEVE stares at him and
ANDY realizes he’s serious The others are looking down and
trying to make themselves look busy but there’s no saving

Andy here

ANDY nods

ANDY
Steve--

STEVE

Five in six is your chance of
surviving first round of Russian
roulette and you’ve reversed those
odds so unless you want to be
disgraced in front of your friends
family colleagues stockholders
and the press I wouldn’t stand
here arguing I’d go try to get
some more bullets out of the gun

(beat)
Do it Andy

to his team that they should come with him and get

back to work As the team starts to walk away STEVE sees one
of the engineers take a diskette out of his shirt pocket and
a light bulb goes off in his head

STEVE (CONTD)
Stop You What size shirt do you
wear

ENGINEER

STEVE
What size--does anyone know what
size shirt he wears Does anyone
know what size shirt I wear

JOANNA
Does anyone know where the closest
psychiatrist is

STEVE
The disk fits in your pocket--I
need a shirt with a breast pocket
I can take it out on stage

ENGINEER
A shirt

STEVE
The disk
(to JOANNA)
I need a white shirt in my size
with a breast pocket

JOANNA
Yes Which one of the no stores
that are open at 845 do you want
me to have someone run to and
return from in 15 minutes

STEVE
Go out in the lobby find someone
my size who’s wearing a white shirt
and tell them I’1l trade them for a
free computer and they get to keep
my shirt

JOANNA
Does it have to be a white shirt
is blue okay

STEVE
No the Mac is beige I’m beige
the disk is blue and the shirt has
to be white Andy

STEVE looks at ANDY and mimes rolling the cartridge of a
revolver and sticking it to his own head along with sound
effects ANDY and his team take off as STEVE heads back into--

LISA
I tried to get it to say hello but
it’s shy

STEVE didn’t even notice she was there He takes a breath and
smiles

STEVE
Yeah

CHRISANN points to the Mac that’s sitting on a table--

CHRISANN
So that’s it

STEVE
That’s it

CHRISANN
(pause)
I don’t get it

STEVE
I know

CHRISANN
What are people going to do with
it

STEVE

(for Chrisann’s benefit)
Lisa how old are you now

CHRISANN
You know how old (she is)

STEVE

STEVE
It’s a computer Can I borrow your
hand for a second

STEVE puts his hand on top of LISA’s and demonstrates the
mouse

STEVE (CONTD)
Point that arrowand click You
don’t have to but if you want you
can play with it Nothing you can
do will break it so just do
whatever you want with it

CHRISANN
What are you doing

While STEVE and CHRISANN continue LISA becomes engaged with
the computer She can hear her parents of course but the
computer and what she’s doing with it become a welcome
distraction

STEVE
I’m paying you exactly what the
court ordered me to pay you

CHRISANN
385 a month

STEVE
I’m not the one who decided on that
amount

CHRISANN

And I’m asking you how you feel--if
you feel alright if it feels
alright to you--that your daughter
and her mother--

STEVE
She’s not--

CHRISANN
--your daughter who’s sitting
right there--and her mother are on
welfare while you’re worth 441
million dollars for making that

STEVE
(pause)
I’m proud to say that Apple donates
free computers to underfunded
schools and we’1l be doing more of--
STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915 27

CHRISANN
What

STEVE

worth of computers to schools

What does that (have to do with--)

STEVE
(over)
Imagine an underprivileged kid who
has their favorite teacher with
them 24 hours We’re minutes away
from being able to do that

CHRISANN
In your head was that an answer to
my question

STEVE
Tell me the question again

CHRISANN
I wasn’t the one who sued you for
child support San Mateo County
sued you

STEVE
No let me explain what happened
‘cause I have plenty of time right
now

There’s a knock on the door and ANDREA opens it--

ANDREA
Excuse me you have a visitor

STEVE (WOZ) WOZNIAK sticks his head in the door WOZ is
amiable He’s not looking for trouble and while he’s an
undisputed genius he doesn’t have Steve’s anger or Steve’s
polish

WOZ
I just wanted to say good luck Hey

CHRISANN

(pause)
I can’t really wait for you to come
up with the metaphor man

WOZ
Yeah so listen I wanted to ask you
a favor

STEVE
Yeah

WOZ

Can you acknowledge the Apple II
team in your remarks

STEVE
(pause)
I can not

WOZ
Just an acknowledgement have them
stand up
STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915

STEVE
We’re launching the Mac

WOZ
Itd be a morale booster Just a
mention so they can get a round of

applause

STEVE
Woz--

WOZ
Just a mention

STEVE
Can we stick a pin in this for a

WOZ
Sure yeah

STEVE

STEVE goes back into--

INT STEVE’S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

STEVE
(to CHRISANN)
I didn’t take the DNA test
voluntarily I took it because the
board was worried you were going to
sue me

CHRISANN
What are you talking about

STEVE
The board Was worried you were
going to sue me before the IPO

STEVE JOBS -

Shooting Script 031915

STEVE (CONTD)

The members of the board
individually believe that you’re
deranged Chris They were worried
that you were going to sue me
before the IPO and endanger the
stock price Fourteen of the
greatest minds in business were
literally weighing the possibility
that you could affect the economy
So I took a blood test which I
obviously wouldn’t have done if I
didn’t think it would prove
conclusively and for all time that
I am not--

(he mouths--“her father” )
--and frankly I think telling her
otherwise is child abuse

CHRISANN
You skipped over the part where the
test proved (that you’re the)--

STEVE
(over)
The test didn’t prove (anything)

CHRISANN
(over)
A 941 chance that--

STEVE
Would you like to be put ina
casket and buried if there’s a
941 chance that you’re dead

CHRISANN
(pause--smiles)
Steve let’s not be ridiculous And
if I wanted to embarrass you if I
wanted to embarrass Apple and if I
wanted to extort money from you
it’s not like I’d have to invent
anything Humiliate me all you want
but you don’t need to look far to
see living reminders that I’m in

found out a fraction of one thing
a small fraction of one symptom of
your progressing Narcissistic
Personality Disorder The boards
right to be scared of me

STEVE without looking at it takes the Mac that Lisa’s been
working on by the handle and turns it around so Chrisann can
see the screen and puts it forcefully back on the table
Lisa’s made a painting The kind of thing only a parent could
love but a painting

STEVE
(without having to look at
it)
That
CHRISANN
What
STEVE

You asked me what people are going
to do with it They’re gonna do
that

There’s a KNOCK on the door and JOANNA enters with a white
shirt

JOANNA
One of the engineers

STEVE
Thank you

STEVE starts to take off his shirt

LISA
Do you like it

STEVE
Sorry

Then STEVE looks at Lisa’s painting which he hadn’t seen when
he turned it around for Chrisannhe’s seeing it for the
first time and he almost involuntarily stops unbuttoning his
shirt

LISA
(pause)
It’s an abstract

STEVE can’t help but let out a laugh and smile at that
There’s an emotion happening inside of him he doesn’t quite
understand

STEVE
(pause)
You used MacPaint

STEVE keeps looking at the screen then glancing at Lisa
STEVE (CONTD)
Push that key and the “S” at the
same time

LISA does as she’s told as the “SAVE” box comes up

STEVE (CONTD)
Now type your name

She does “L-I-S-A B-R-E-N-N-A-N”

STEVE (CONTD)
Do you know which box says “Save”

LISA points to the right box

STEVE (CONTD)
Right Go ahead and click on it

She does
After a moment STEVE continues changing his shirt

STEVE (CONTD)
(pause--then to CHRISANN)
I’1l put some money in your
account And I’1ll buy you a new
house someplace near a decent
school

CHRISANN

LISA

This hits STEVE and CHRISANN in two different ways but it
hits them both

LISA (CONTD)
(pause)
On the computer

CHRISANN
Lisa wait for me in the hall
please

LISA starts to put on her coat which is a little bulky and
tough for a kid--

CHRISANN (CONT’D)
You can put on your coat in the

hall

STEVE
Bye Lisa

LISA
Bye

CHRISANN

In the hall Lisa now

STEVE
I do like your painting

But LISA didn’t hear him--she’s already out the door

STEVE (CONTD)

CHRISANN exits

JOANNA

STEVE’s tying his tie

STEVE
Woz wants me to acknowledge the
Apple II team

JOANNA
(pause)
You must be able to see that she
looks like you

STEVE
I don’t want to insult Woz I just
think it’s backward-looking at
exactly the wrong moment

JOANNA
I know you heard (what I said)

STEVE

(over--he means this)
I heard what you said Joanna
We’re about to do this thing--at
941 the planet’s gonna shift on
its axis nigh and forever The two
most significant events of the 20th
Century--the Allies win the War and

me for not being a better father to

you could also say you’re gonna do

then not do it you good with that

WOZ
Can I tell you something

STEVE

now

WOZ
After the meeting in Maui the Apple

down and you know why

All
STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915 38

STEVE
Because the Apple II wasn’t
mentioned even once

WOZ
The Apple II wasn’t mentioned even--

It wasn’t an oversight

If you embarrass these people
you’re gonna see a brain drain at

well be able to hear his opening remarks without paying much
attention to them

he’s supposed to wait backstage

He sees a welcoming sight--the first one of the day It’s
JOHN SCULLEY SCULLEY’s a handsome and easygoing man about 20
years older than Steve He’s got a bottle of wine and two
glasses STEVE smiles and walks over to him as the opening
remarks continue in the background

STEVE hugs SCULLEY and they speak quietly--

‘Cause I hear you’ve been worse

It’s nine in the morning

SCULLEY
This is a ‘55 Margaux

SCULLEY starts pouring two glasses--

SCULLEY (CONTD)
Is it my imagination or have you
started to dress like me

STEVE
It was a bad idea to have Markkula
open with quarterly reports
Instead of having Markkula open we
could have just dropped water on
the audience

SCULLEY laughs a little--

STEVE (CONTD)
You know just big 10000 gallon
tanks of cold water dropped from
the ceiling save Mike some money
on index cards

SCULLEY

I think it’s a good board but if
you want me to push ‘em out one by
one we can talk about that

STEVE
I want you to push ‘em out all at
once Through a window if it’s the
nearest exit The looks on their
faces when we showed ‘em the spot

SCULLEY
I couldn’t see their faces ‘cause
they were banging their heads on
the table

STEVE
Some of them were frozen like
they’d just seen “Springtime for
Hitler”

SCULLEY
My highlight was the silence that
was broken by “It’s supposed to be
a play on the Orwell book right”
Yeah the spot’s called “1984”

The “1984” ad starts playing on the screen--we’re seeing it
from behind--and as soon as it starts the CROWD ROARS

We paid skinheads I have skinheads
on my payroll

STEVE
(beat)

Not currently I don’t think but--
SCULLEY

Why
STEVE

They had a look he wanted
SCULLEY

The skinheads
STEVE

Yeah
SCULLEY

‘Kay let’s keep that to ourselves
‘cause it might offend some of our
customers

STEVE JOBS -

Shooting Script 031915

STEVE
Which ones

SCULLEY
All the ones who aren’t skinheads

STEVE
My point is they didn’t get it

SCULLEY
They did not

STEVE
They didn’t get it they didn’t
like it they tried to pull it
they were wrong we were right and
that boardroom is a big bowl of
scares-the-living-shit-—outta-me

SCULLEY
I’m running your pass blocking on
the board Who else knows

STEVE
Who else knows what

SCULLEY
That we paid terrorists to be in
our TV commercial

STEVE
John--

SCULLEY
They were wrong about the ad but
it’s a good board they’re good
people

STEVE
Their only problem their problem
is that they’re people
Peoplethe nature of peopleis
something to be overcome

SCULLEY

SCULLEY
Youre not surrounded by enemies

We’re almost there About two more
minutes of quarterly reports

They listen to Markkula’s remarks a moment

STEVE
(pause)
Chrisann came and she brought Lisa

SCULLEY
I had a hunch

STEVE
I’m going back and forth on the
Dylan I might quote a different
verse

SCULLEY
What are the choices

STEVE
“For the loser now will be later to
win” which is what we have now

SCULLEY
Or

STEVE
“Itll soon shake your windows and
rattle your walls”

SCULLEY
No

STEVE
Why

SCULLEY

We’re leading a geek revolution and
not the French Revolution what
else

STEVE (CONTD)
And don’t criticize what you can’t
understand Your sons and your
daughters--”

SCULLEY
“--are beyond your command” I just
lost a hundred bucks to Andy
Hertzfeld He said you’d change it
to that verse We’ve got 45 seconds
left and I want to use it to ask
you a question Why do people who
were adopted feel like they were
rejected instead of selected

STEVE
That came out of nowhere

SCULLEY
“Your sons and your daughters are
beyond your command Your old road
is rapidly aging So go fuck
yourself ‘cause my name is Steve
Jobs and the times they are a-
changin’”

STEVE
I don’t feel rejected

SCULLEY
You sure

STEVE
Very sure

SCULLEY
‘Cause it’s not like the baby is
born and the parents look and say
“Nah we’re not interested in this
one” On the other hand someone
did choose you

STEVE
It’s a song about progress

SCULLEY
It’s about destroying the past

STEVE
As long as clocks work the past
will destroy itself by being the
past

STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915

SCULLEY
No you have to consciously get rid
of it or the past will be the
present as well

And STEVE’s so happy that someone’s articulated this--

STEVE
Yes Yes I was (testing you)--
SCULLEY
(over)
Yeah
STEVE

Thats exactly--see--that’s
exactly what--you’re the only one--
God--that’s what I meant You’re
the only one who sees the world the
way I do

(beat)
What inspired Hertzfeld to make
that bet

SCULLEY
He was warning me that being your
father figure could be dangerous
I can start replacing the board
with more Steve-friendly members

STEVE
(pause)
It’s having no control

SCULLEY
You’re the company you have
control
STEVE
I wasn’t talking about the company
(beat)

You find out that you were out of
the loop when the most crucial
events in your life were set in
motion As long as you have
controlI don’t understand people
who give it up

(beat)
He said being a father figure to me
was dangerous

SCULLEY
He didn’t mean anything by it

STEVE
Keep your hundred bucks I’m
sticking with the first verse

SCULLEY
Good

STEVE
What the hell did he (mean by
that)

SCULLEY
(over)
Nothing
(beat)
I’m proud of you

He doesn’t get weepy but that always means a lot to STEVE

STEVE
Thank you boss

But this isn’t Bob Dylan’s version--it’s a woman singing and

BILL TAHILL (INDUSTRY EXPERT)
The insistence by Steve Jobs that
it have what’s called end to end
control which is a way of saying
that it’s not compatible with most

STEVE’s alone on stage in a pool of light His hair’s a
little shorter now and his haircuts cost a few hundred bucks
But the real difference is a lighthearted air--an easy sense
of humor

On a beautifully lit table sits a black cube shrouded in a
black cloth and next to it sits a vase of flowers Slides
change on the screen in back of Steve to accompany what he’s
saying

GEORGE
I think we want sharp focus

STEVE
It looks like I’m Steve the
Magnificent

GEORGE
You can’t see it from your angle

STEVE
I’ve seen it from every seat in the
building and from too many of them
does it look like I’m about to
produce a silk scarf Don’t take it
personally I’m just not a fan of
the circus aesthetic

GEORGE
(calling out)
Alright let’s hold here
(to STEVE)
We’re gonna have to go up and re-
focus the instruments

STEVE
(pointing up)
Just one--the 30’s fine

JOANNA’s walked on stage and is of course four years older

JOANNA
While we’re holding there are well-
wishers in the VIP room

They start heading off stage--

STEVE
I like the circus I love the
circus but why does it still look
like that

JOANNA
And Woz is here

STEVE
Those performers are unbelievable
They have mastered incredibly hard
albeit not very useful skills--I
don’t know what the hell goes on in
the Ukraine--and it should be
presented in a more--I’m gonna
revolutionize the circus

JOANNA
Why are you in a good mood

STEVE
I’m always in a good mood

JOANNA
John Sculley’s here too

STEVE doesn’t like hearing that and he takes his frustration
out on the door as he pushes it open and they walk into--

32 INT CATACOMBS OF OPERA HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 32

JOANNA
It’s nice that he’s here

STEVE
No more blue tents with yellow
stars no more costumes and
transvestite make-up--a black
stage white light and I’1l be
perfectly honest I’m back and forth
on clowns you know why

JOANNA
And Andy Hertzfeld You have to see
them they want to pay their

respects

STEVE
Not one of them has ever made me
laugh

JOANNA

You have to see them anyway

STEVE
I was talking about clowns you
unassimilated commie

JOANNA
Look--

STEVE
If they really wished me well
theyd keep it to themselves

JOANNA
Can I tell you something

STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915 64
32

STEVE
I don’t think they do wish me well
but I’m alright with that I’m over
Apple I got over the Mac and Woz
and Sculley the same way you get
over your high school sweetheart
Build a new one

JOANNA

Can I tell you something
STEVE

Yes
JOANNA

You said you wouldn’t compete with
them and you designed a computer
specifically for the education
market which they putatively own so
I think it’s cool they’re here

STEVE
They’re suing me

JOANNA
Still it was nice they came

STEVE
They’re not being magnanimous they
want it to look like an amicable
divorce History doesn’t remember
Joe DiMaggio kindly for dumping
Marilyn

JOANNA makes a suppressed but loud sound while shutting her
eyes and shaking her fists at God

STEVE (CONTD)
What’s your problem

JOANNA
I don’t know but I’m sure it can be
traced back to you You know I’m
the one who has to explain you to
people 100000 to Paul Rand for a
corporate logo when we didn’t even
know what our company made A
650000 mold for the Cube because
God forbid the angles are 901
instead of 90

STEVE JOBS -

STEVE
I forbid the angles be 901 instead
of 90 That box could be on display
at the Guggenheim and you’re
forgetting about the number of
coats of paint

JOANNA

On the Cube or the factory As if
customers are out there thinking
“You know I’d buy that thing except
I’m not sure I like the color of
the walls at their plant in Fort
Worth”

STEVE
Youre very funny for someone with
no imagination

JOANNA
Don’t give them a reason to say to
the press you have a chip on your
shoulder will you do that for me

STEVE
I don’t have a chip on my shoulder

JOANNA
(trying not to laugh)
Okay but don’t give them a reason
to say you do

STEVE
I don’t

JOANNA
That’s the right attitude

STEVE
It’s not an att--

They’re gonna call me back in a
minute to look at the light

JOANNA’s starting to try to figure something out
JOANNA

Okay Who do you want first

STEVE
Bring me the face of Steve Wozniak

STEVE walks into--

33 INT STEVE’S OPERA HOUSE DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 33

--where he walks to a small refrigerator and takes out a
bottle of water He turns around and--

STEVE
Aagh

STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915 67
33

--reacts to the sight of LISA now nine years old who he
clearly didn’t know was in the room

LISA is studiously measuring the sides of the NeXT Computer
the black cube with a plastic ruler She has a Sony Walkman
on her waist with the headphones around her neck

LISA
Hang on
STEVE
I thought you went to school
LISA
Hang on
STEVE

You were supposed to go to school
an hour ago I thought you left

LISA
I didn’t wake up my mom on time
this morning It’s happened before
too I wake up with the alarm and
then I get dressed and eat
breakfast but then sometimes I
forget to see what time it is after
that

STEVE
(pause)
Why doesn’t your mom just set her
own alarm clock

LISA
It’s one of my chores

STEVE hates hearing this but doesn’t want to get into it

STEVE
(pause)
Well I don’t understand what that
has to do with why you’re still--
where’s your mother

LISA
She went to find a pay phone

STEVE
An hour ago she said--

LISA raises her hand
STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915 68

STEVE (CONTD)
You don’t have to raise your hand

LISA

You said it was off by a little
STEVE

It is
LISA

I just measured it

STEVE looks at her a second and then goes to the door and
pops his head out looking for help--

STEVE
(calling)
Joanna
LISA

Exactly a foot on all four sides

STEVE
There are six sides but you’re not
supposed to be here right now

LISA
We know if four sides are equal to
each other the other two are equal

as well
STEVE
What grade are you in
LISA
Fourth
STEVE
You’re nowhere near taking
geometry
LISA

It’s just logic

STEVE
The top bottom right and left are
about a millimeter shorter than the
front and back

LISA
They’re not I measured them

STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915

STEVE
Lisa I’m kind of an expert in
design and that’s a 20 cent ruler
you think there’s a chance it could
be off

LISA thinks about it a moment

LISA
pause)
If I had another ruler I could
measure the ruler but I really
doubt (it’s off)

STEVE
When your mother--
LISA
‘Cause it’s a ruler
STEVE
(beat)
--comes back you have to go to
school
LISA
Why is it off
STEVE
Did you hear what I just said
LISA
Yes
STEVE

‘Cause sometimes it seems like you
just keep saying what you want
without listening

LISA
I’m listening

There’s a silence for a moment

STEVE
Is there something you need

LISA
No

Another uncomfortable silence

STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915 70
33

LISA (CONTD)
(pause)
Why isn’t it a perfect cube

STEVE
You’ve asked me before

LISA
I forgot what it is

STEVE
It’s an optical anomaly To the
human eye a perfect cube doesn’t
look like a cube so we made it
roughly a millimeter shorter than a
foot on two sides

LISA
What’s an anomaly

STEVE
You’ve asked me that before too I
don’t know why you do that

LISA doesn’t really know what to saybecause she’s nine

STEVE (CONTD)
(pause)
It’s an exception something that
doesn’t fit a pattern

There’s a knock on the door--
STEVE (CONT’D)
You have to go to school
(calling)
Come in

JOANNA opens the door and she and WOZ enter--

JOANNA

I think you two have met
STEVE

Hey man

Hello old friend

STEVE
You look well

STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915

WOZ
This can’t be Lisa
STEVE

STEVE
Insanely great

WOZ
You know this is the first time
ever we haven’t played for the same
team It’s like you’re releasing
your first solo album I appreciate
your inviting me to the launch

STEVE
I just want to wipe the slate
clean

WOZ

That’s exactly what I want That’s
why I came backstage I want you to
know I’1l be out there with you

STEVE JOBS -

Shooting Script 031915

STEVE
Any chance I could get you to go
out there instead of me

WOZ
I love you Steve
STEVE
I love you too Woz
WOZ
You know--some things were said--
STEVE
They were
WOZ

They were
(pause)
I’m clumsy at this I guess--

STEVE
They were said in public

WOZ
(beat)
Yeah

STEVE
They were published You knew you
were talking to a reporter from
Fortune right You weren’t
tricked

WOZ

STEVE
(pointing)
Watch your step

WOZ
Look I don’t even remember exactly
what I said I know it was--

STEVE
(no problem)
“Steve can be an insulting and
hurtful guy”

WOZ
Yeah

STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915 74
34 34

STEVE
(no problem)
“TI look forward to a great product
and I wish him success--

WOZ
Yeah

STEVE
(problem)
“--but his integrity I cannot
trust” Wait here a second

They’re backstage now and STEVE walks onto the stage where
there’s a new pool of light waiting for him We stay on WOZ
backstage for a moment who now understands that Steve’s
version of wiping the slate clean and his are two different
things

GEORGE COATES calls from out in the house--

GEORGE
Good

STEVE looks at the floor at the edges of the pool of light--

STEVE
Good Where do you want to pick it
up

GEORGE

The thesaurus

STEVE
A word that’s sometimes used to
describe me--

GEORGE
Hold please they’re not cued up

STEVE
Weve got about 10 minutes before
we have to clear the house

GEORGE
I doubt we’re starting on time

STEVE
I promise you we are

GEORGE
We still have to get through--
STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915 75
34 34

STEVE
We make computers we’re--I’ve had
this conversation before--we’re
starting on time

The giant screen behind Steve is showing the NeXT desktop as
STEVE demonstrates the thesaurus feature

GEORGE
Go ahead

STEVE
A word that’s sometimes used to
describe me is “mercurial”

GEORGE
Hold for laugh

STEVE

Let’s look at the dictionary
definitions

(scrolling to it)
“Of or relating to or born under
the planet Mercury”

(scrolling down)
I think the third one is what they
mean

STEVE glances offstage where he sees that LISA is now
watching a few feet from WOZ

STEVE (CONTD)
“Characterized by unpredictable
changeableness of mood”

GEORGE
Hold for laugh

STEVE
If we scroll down the thesaurus
though we see the antonym is
“saturnine” By simply double-
clicking on it we immediately look
that up in the dictionary and here
it is “Cold and steady in moods
Slow to act or change Of a gloomy
or surly disposition”

GEORGE
Hold for laugh
STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915 76
34 34

STEVE
So I don’t think “mercurial” is so
bad after all

GEORGE
Let’s jump to 141

STEVE
Gimme just a second

STEVE walks to the wings--

STEVE (CONT’D)
(to LISA)
It’s against the law for you not to
be in school

LISA
My mom said I could watch

STEVE
Where is she

STEVE leads LISA and WOZ back into--

35 INT CATACOMBS - CONTINUOUS 35

LISA
Why did mercurial end up not being
a bad word

STEVE
Do you remember asking me that the
night before last when you were
having dinner at my house

LISA
I forgot the answer

STEVE
The word that was the opposite of
mercurial was bad which meant
mercurial was good

LISA
I don’t get it

STEVE
I think you do get it

LISA
I don’t
STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915 77
35 35

STEVE
‘Cause we also talked about it when
you came to the rehearsal last
week

LISA
Why aren’t the angles straight

STEVE
The angles

LISA
On the Cube

STEVE
The angles are straight

LISA
I meant why aren’t they straight on
other things

STEVE
Why does it feel like you’re
working me

LISA
I’m not

STEVE
Woz Why aren’t the angles straight
on other things

WOZ

(to LISA)
When the manufacturers make things
with 90 degree angles they cheat
the angle a little bit--89 91--so
that it’s easier to get the object
out of the mold Like getting a
cake out of a pan But on your
dad’s new computer he insisted the
angles be exactly 90 degrees

LISA
Why

WOZ
He’s a perfectionist

LISA
Cool
STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915 78
35 35
STEVE
Some people don’t mean cool when
they use that word
WOZ
(to LISA)
I did

STEVE opens the door to --

ago
CHRISANN
She wants to watch her father’s

Wait in here I’1l be right back

LISA
(to CHRISANN)
I saw the thesaurus

STEVE closes the door behind her and stands alone in the hall
with WOZ--

STEVE
Were you pressured to do it

What do you mean

STEVE looks aroundthen WOZ follows him through a double-
door marked “Authorized Personnel Only” and into--

slowly

STEVE JOBS -

Shooting Script 031915

STEVE
Check it out It’s the orchestra
pit for the San Francisco Opera

WOZ
Was I pressured to do it

STEVE
I once met Seiji Ozawa at
Tanglewood Thunderous conductor
Ungodly artfulness and nuance And
I asked him what exactly a
conductor does that a metronome
cant do Surprisingly--

WOZ
--he didn’t beat the shit out of
you

STEVE
(laughing at Woz’s joke)
That’s right No he said “The
musicians play their instruments I
play the orchestra”

WOZ
That feels like something that
sounds good but doesn’t mean
anything

STEVE
Markkula Sculley did they ask you
to slag me off in the press

WOZ
I had reason (to be angry)

STEVE
(over)
Did they

WOZ
Absolutely not

STEVE
But they asked you to talk

WOZ
Apple was under siege you’d just
left the company somebody had to
talk to the press

STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915 80

STEVE
(old time producer)
I’m right here Woz the company
left me

WOZ
I begged you I begged you The
Apple II accounted for 70 of
revenue what’d you think was gonna
happen You didn’t care enough
about the Apple II or the Lisa

STEVE
Let’s be really clear I didn’t
care at all about the Apple II or
the Lisa

WOZ
I wasn’t pressured to do it What I
said to the press was an honest if
tempered reflection of what I

believed

STEVE
Woz

WOZ
Yeah

STEVE

What the fuck is on your wrist

WOZ
You want to know

STEVE
I literally can’t wait

WOZ
Everyone’s going to be wearing this
in 10 years It’s a Nixie Watch
made using Nixie tubes

WoZ is showing STEVE his watch It’s a chunky thing that
gives a large digital read-out of the time The thing is that

(over)
I came here ‘cause you’re gonna get
killed Your computer is going to
fail You had a college and
university advisory board telling
you they need a powerful
workstation for 2 to 3 thousand
youve priced NeXT at 6500 which
doesn’t include the optional three
thousand-dollar hard drive which
people will discover isn’t optional
because the optical disk is too
weak to do anything and the twenty
five hundred dollar laser printer
brings the total to twelve-thousand
dollars and in the entire world
you are the only person who cares
that it’s housed in a perfect cube
You’re gonna get killed and I came
here to stand next to you while
that happens because that’s what
friends do that’s what men do I
dont need your pass We go back so
don’t talk to me like I’m other
people I’m the only one who knows
that this guy here is someone you
invented I’m standing by you
‘cause that perfect cube that does
nothing is about to be the single
biggest failure in the history of

demonstrate itself

youve built is a black cube

The Apple II is the only thing
making money

STEVE
That’s because we keep selling it

SCULLEY
(pause--this is awkward
and hard)
I can’t diagram that logic but--

STEVE
We keep making it so people keep--
the Mac needs to sell for 1995

SCULLEY
There is no market research telling
us the Mac is failing because it’s
overpriced It’s telling us that
people don’t like it because they
think it doesn’t DO anything it’s
closed end to end We didn’t know
it wasn’t what people wanted but it
isn’t they want slots they want
choices they want options The way
we buy stereos mix and match
components

STEVE
John listen to me Whoever said
the customer is always right was I
promise you a customer

SCULLEY
My job is to make a recommendation
to the board

STEVE
You thought it was dark

SCULLEY
(beat)
They thought it was--it had
skinheads in it but that’s (not the
point)

STEVE
(over)
She was liberating them

SCULLEY
Liberating the skinheads

STEVE
The ad didnt have anything to do
with fucking skinheads We used
them as fucking extras Nobody even
knows they were skinheads

SCULLEY
I’m saying the board--

STEVE
You invented lifestyle advertising
and “our brand” was my brand

STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915

SCULLEY

We showed a lot of happy people
drinking Pepsi we didn’t say the
world was gonna come to an end if
you bought a Dr Pepper And we
showed the product We showed it
being opened we showed it being
poured being consumed--

STEVE
You think the secret to your
success was not assuming people
knew what they were supposed to do
with a can of soda

SCULLEY
I didnt kill the ad Steve Im
the only reason it made it on the
air

INT STEVE’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
STEVE
If we drop the price and (double
the budget) --

SCULLEY

QUICK CUT TO

Steve You can’t drop the price and
double a budget The only way to do

that is to take money out of the
Apple II and--

STEVE
The Apple II should embarrass you
It embarrasses me If you had any
pride at all--

SCULLEY
It doesn’t embarrass the
shareholders Steve (the share) --

STEVE
(over)
I don’t give a shit about--the
shareholders are your problem
that’s why I hired you so I don’t
ever have to hear about--

STEVE JOBS - Shooting Script 031915

SCULLEY

The shareholders are my problem and

the board represents the
shareholders That’s how it
works

STEVE
(figuring it out)

You’re doing both You’re moving me

off the Mac and phasing it out

SCULLEY
Yes

STEVE

CUT BACK TO

Woz and I offered to put up our own

money and you’re the only reason
the ad was on the air

SCULLEY
Yes

STEVE
How do you figure

SCULLEY
Wed bought three spots in the
Super Bowl--two 30’s and a 60--for
six-hundred thousand and after we
screened it the board wanted that
money back and they asked me to
sell off the spots ChiatDay sold

off the two 30’s but not the 60 and

I let it be known to Lee Clow that
if he didn’t try very hard to sell
the last spot I wouldn’t be

unhappy And that’s how the ad got

on the air Maybe remember that the

next time someone tells you you
were brilliant to only run the ad
once

INT STEVE’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Youre really talking about killing
the Mac

SCULLEY

myself

SCULLEY

Don’t do that

STEVE
I am doing that

SCULLEY
You can’t

INT BALCONY LOBBY - SAME TIME

STEVE
You sure it wasn’t Lee Clow who
dragged his feet selling the 60

SCULLEY
At my direction Steve you think
he would have done that on his
own Taken it on himself

STEVE
Yes I think he would have done
what it took to save it from you

SCULLEY
I was the only thing protecting it

STEVE
You didn’t want the ad because you
were trying to kill the Mac two
months before it launched

SCULLEY
You are fucking delusional

in various different dress--some from an evening out STEVE
stands to the side while SCULLEY addresses the board --

SCULLEY
We’re losing market share and the
Mac is losing money Our only hope
is the Apple II which is stagnating
because of it’s soon-to-be-obsolete
DOS Users are already rigging
their machines to run with the CPM
operating system that’s been built
to run on Intel I can’t put it
more simply than this--we need to
put our resources into updating the
Apple II

STEVE
By taking resources from the Mac

SCULLEY
It’s failing that’s a fact

STEVE
It’s overpriced

There is no evidence--

driving the bus we’ve lost
hundreds of millions in value and
I’m the CEO of Apple Steve that’s

STEVE
But before that you sold carbonated
sugar water right I sat ina
fuckin’ garage with Wozniak and
invented the future because artists
lead and hacks ask for a show of

Alright wellthis guy’s outta

hand in my resignation tonight But
if you want me to stay you can’t
have Steve He’ll have to sever any
connection to Apple Settle him

You’ve done an outstanding job over

‘cause none of them and none of
their editors and none of the
editors’ publishers to this day
have any idea that you forced it
That you forced the board even
after I told you exactly what
they’d do Which is exactly what
they did Unanimously

STEVE
I don’t have any trouble
remembering that John because of
it being the worst night of my life
and I forced a vote because I
believed I was right I still
believe I’m rightand I’m right
I bled that night and I don’t
bleed But time’s done its thing

The thing is when they sent it up
they didn’t know yet how they were
gonna get it back but they felt
like they were close enough that in
the eight years it was gonna be up
there they’d figure it out They
didn’t So after eight years it
lost its orbit and came crashing
down in a thousand-mile swath
across the Indian Ocean Little to
the left little to the right and
somebody coulda gotten hurt

I really wanted to build a computer
for colleges The technology just
didn’t catch up as fast as I needed
it to And you know we’re outta
money But then Apple stopped
innovating and I saw something
better Joanna I know schools
aren’t gonna buy a 13000
dictionary with good speakers you
know I know that But Apple will
‘cause Avie Tevanian is gonna build
exactly the OS they need And
they’re gonna have to buy me too

Close one This was almost
embarrassing for me

ANDY
I understand how--

STEVE
I’1l wire you the money today

ANDY
I understand how you feel and I do
apologize I do but let me tell
you my thinking

STEVE
I can’t even think of an
appropriate analogy to describe
(what you did)

ANDY
I knew you guys would fix things
you always do but in the meantime
if the money wasn’t there she’d
miss a semester of school

STEVE
Yeah

ANDY
And she’d have to tell her friends
why And she needed things she
needed socks

also consider--Chrisann’s a friend
outside of what you and I--outside
of our (relationship)

STEVE
So you’re like a family advisor

ANDY
Im a family friend

STEVE
Then you probably know Lisa’s been
seeing a therapist

ANDY
Yeah

STEVE
For many years

ANDY
Yeah

STEVE

Without my knowledge

ANDY
That really wasn’t my business

STEVE
I’m fascinated by what you think is
and isn’t your business

STEVE JOBS -

Shooting Script 031915

ANDY
Lisa’s been going to a therapist
and she likes it and would love for
you and Chrisann to go with her

STEVE
And the reason you know that is
that you’re the one who recommended
the therapist

ANDY
I know a guy he specializes in--

STEVE
No I mean you’re the one who
recommended that she see a
therapist

ANDY
I--you know what it was a while
ago and I don’t remember how the
whole--who said what to--

STEVE
You told Chrisann that Lisa should
see a therapist

ANDY
Steve you’re stigmatizing--it’s
not--my thing was how can it hurt

STEVE

Let’s find out
ANDY

Chrisann is my friend
STEVE

What was the reason you gave
ANDY

Chrisann why Lisa should see a
therapist

STEVE JOBS -

Shooting Script 031915

ANDY
I don’t remember We were talking
and I said--it was pretty much what
I just said that it certainly
couldn’t hurt

STEVE
You didn’t say Lisa needed a strong
male role model

ANDY

(pause)
I did

(pause)
I think it’s a miracle she’s not
robbing banks with the Symbionese
Liberation Army There is no reason
in the world why she should be
nice But she is So I helped
Because somebody had to

STEVE

I’1l wire the money to you this
afternoon

ANDY gets up and heads to the door

ANDY
You threatened me a long time ago

STEVE

ANDY

once

STEVE
People are attracted to people with
talent and people without it find
that threatening Maybe you should
see a therapist It certainly

As a matter of fact I was destroyed
by the Apple II and its open system

developed a grand total of no new
products

this company’s ever made I’m sorry

You came a half-inch from putting
this company out of business now

letting you keep your job You get
a pass

WOZ
When people used to ask me what the
difference was between me and Steve
Jobs Id say Steve was the big
picture guy and I liked a solid
workbench When people ask me what
the difference is now I just say
Steve’s an asshole The things you
make are better than you are
brother

I once asked Paul McCartney what

Beatles and you know what he said
The drumming

WOZ

No it was John

WOZ has waited years to say this and for all those years he
hoped he wouldn’t have to

WOZ
Maybe one day you’ll make something

little box of garbage more than
youve ever made in your life

STEVE holds a moment nods and heads over to JOANNA who’s
clocked this whole last exchange

JOANNA
He didn’t mean it

STEVE

JOANNA

The hallway’s a little crowded now with Apple employees
lining the walls including JOANNA They’ll serve as an escort
backstage but right now coming down the hall toward STEVE--

--is LISA At 19 she’s a beautiful young woman with a
striking resemblance to her father She’s wearing a coat and
has the same headphones around her neck that we saw her in
when she was nine She’s nothing like a stereotypical
teenager--she’s without affect and only uses irony in very
small doses We’re aware that she’s ill at ease and self-
protective and uncomfortable

She walks down the hallway which is lined with “Think
Different” posters that have a picture of the iMac

STEVE watches her walk toward him--he’s too worn out now to
have a real confrontation with her but he’1ll be slowly forced
into it He takes his arm to move her to the side of the
corridor and he does his best to speak privately while almost
surrounded by people

STEVE
(speaking quietly in
Lisa’s ear)
I’m paying your tuition Are you
crazy Of course I’m paying your
tuition

infection

STEVE

She’s had the same sinus infection

LISA
I’m gonna take care of my mother
I’m sorry if that angers you

STEVE
It does anger me ‘cause you’re a
kid and it’s not your job to take
care of your mother

LISA
Is that how yours died

This just went to the next level and JOANNA’s just seen
that

JOANNA
Guys step away please and give them
some room

Everyone creates a little more space but total privacy is
really impossible right now

When your mom is 90 and can’t feed
herself you can take care of her

it’s worth twice that much today
and she sold it for two magic rocks
and a bowl of soup

LISA
It was her house

STEVE

It was her money which you make her
beg for

Andy and asking him for the money
That was so off-the-charts over

And then sells them for a fraction
of what she paid And she does it
with money I gave to her for you--

JOANNA
Steve

STEVE
You came to me hysterical when you
were (13 asking if you could live
with me)--

LISA

I wasn’t hysterical

asked you

piece of journal--you were never

supposed to read that--

LISA

I had two different Harvard
statisticians try to reverse
engineer the equation you came up
with to prove that 28 of American

men could be my father

STEVE
Honey--

LISA can’t help but raise her voice a little She’s not

I

someone who likes dramatics but she’s upset now There’s no
way the others are going to be able to avoid hearing this

LISA

My mother may be a troubled woman

but what’s your excuse
(beat)

That’s why I’m not impressed with
your story dad It’s that you knew
and you didn’t do anything about it

and that makes you an

unconscionable coward And not for
nothin’ but “Think” is a verb
making “Different” an adverb
Youre asking people to “Think

--where the energy of the audience is louder The STAGE
MANAGER is waiting as is the WOMAN at the PA microphone

STEVE and LISA stand there a moment

STAGE MANAGER
On your cue Steve

LISA
Are you nervous

STEVE shakes his head “no” He takes a moment and then nods a
little to the STAGE MANAGER--I’m ready let’s go”

STAGE MANAGER

The AUDIENCE begins CLAPPING in anticipation--

Go Cue l

On the giant screen the “Think Different” commercial starts
playing to THUNDEROUS CHEERS from the AUDIENCE We’1ll HEAR it
but NEVER SEE IT

We HEAR the audio as “Both Sides Now” continues The famous
audio only serves as background What we’re watching is
everyone--everyone but STEVE--taken by the ad STEVE’s taken
by other things he’s remembering One of them’s Lisa

VOICE OVER
Heres to the crazy ones The
misfits The rebels The
troublemakers

STEVE’s standing in the dark next to LISA listening to these
words We MOVE IN SLOWLY on his face as he prepares to go on

VOICE OVER (CONTD)
The round pegs in the square holes
The ones who see things
differently

And we start to INTERCUT with various people out in the
house which is packed with 2600 eager people--ANDY
HERTZFELDWOZ taking his seat

VOICE OVER (CONTD)
Theyre not fond of rules And they
have no respect for the status quo
You can quote them disagree with
them glorify or vilify them

AVIE TEVANIANANDREA CUNNINGHAM

VOICE OVER (CONTD)
About the only thing you cant do
is ignore them Because they change
things They push the human race
forward

JOANNA slips in the backwith SCULLEY

VOICE OVER (CONTD)
And while some may see them as the
crazy ones we see genius

And were backstage on STEVE and LISA again as “Both Sides
Now continues over Is the song regretful like Lisa said or
does Steve still have a chance to fix himself

Because the people who think
theyre crazy enough to change the
world are the ones who do

STEVE
(whispering to LISA)
You remember that painting you did
here on the original Mac

LISA thinksand then shakes her head “no”
STEVE (CONT’D)
(whispering)

I do

And LISA hears this and then wipes a tear from her eye with
her sleeve

The AUDIENCE goes crazy as the PA WOMAN says into the
microphone--

PA WOMAN
Ladies and gentlemen Steve Jobs
