INT MAX’S HOME - EVENING

Black screen Echoing through a house we hear A BOY BARKING
and A DOG YELPING

The picture comes up and a raggedy black dog tears down a set

of stairs toward us

MAX eight years old and wearing a white wolf suit jumps
down the stairs tumbling toward the camera growling and
chasing the dog For some reason Max is holding a fork

He jumps to the bottom of the stairs tucking and rolling
screeching a feral war-cry and follows the dog off-screen

Max chases the dog under the dining room table and closes in

He leaps and grabs the dog and howling and somersaulting
they wrestle happily together until the screen freezes

CUT TO
TITLE CARD WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE
EXT SNOW-COVERED SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Maxs legs protrude from a hand-dug opening in a large snow
embankment - a remnant of the morning’s snowplows

He crawls out and stands over it surveying his creation A
proud and crooked grin spreads across his face

He runs off toward his house wanting badly to tell someone
about it

INT EXT MAXS HOME - DAY
Max runs up to the window and taps on the glass Inside is

his sister Claire 14 talking on the phone with great
intensity

We see only Max’s eyes peering over the window sill

MAX
(muffled through the glass)
Hey Claire Wanna see something
great

Claire is too involved in her phone call to pay Max any
attention

CLAIRE
Who else was there

( )
WTWTA Revised November 21 2008 (Buff) pg 2

MAX
(trying again)
It’s an igloo

CLAIRE
And

MAX
I made it

Claire doesn’t respond Her phone call is very important to
her

CLAIRE
(responding to the intrusion)
Yeah my brother No I can’t
We’re supposed to go to my dad’s
that weekend

MAX
The snowplows left some snow across
the street and I dug a hole into
it

CLAIRE

Max go play with your friends
Max is crushed He walks off dejected
INT IGLOO - DAY

Max sits resting in his igloo deep in thought He exits the
igloo with a makeshift flag -- a plastic bag tied to a birch
twig He marches over to a nearby wooden fence and barks
orders to it

MAX
You Go that way You Go that way

The fence isn’t responding Max kicks it

MAX (CONTD)
Don’t talk to me like that You’re
just a fence Go play with your own
fence friends Now move out

He runs to his fort and carefully secures his flag to the
top He adjusts it two or three times to make it just right -
Max is something of a perfectionist

Just then Max watches as a car pulls into his driveway Max
sees a group of teenage boys and girls get out of the car and
lope into his house

8A

WTWTA Revised November 21 2008 (Buff) pg 3

Max gets an idea He jumps into his igloo and scoops up all
of his snowballs He can’t carry them all so he hurriedly
rolls them out the entrance

He runs across the street to his house closer to his prey
carefully balancing his ammunition on his coat kangaroo
style He hides behind the neighbor’s low fence

He waits excitedly organizing his arsenal while stealthily
peering over the fence He watches the teens while they’re
inside his house Meanwhile he makes more snowballs

The teenagers come outside with Claire Max holds a snowball
giddy with anticipation He waits until they’re close enough
and then jumps up and unleashes his projectiles His aim
isn’t so good but he has the element of surprise on his
side A few snowballs hit the teenagers and when they see
that it’s him they laugh and start throwing snowballs back
The fight is on

As Max is reloading a large mound of snow is dumped on his
back The boys are close now on the other side of the fence
It’s time to retreat Max bolts He runs across the street
giddy -- the thrill of battle

He gets to his fort just in time and dives inside He slides
into his little cave - nervous and happy He’s safe

But the boys are upon him Through the fort’s entrance he
sees them approach

An arm comes through the side searching for Max Max squirms
out of the way his eyes wide with alarm

Then there’s a sickening crunch from above Another crunch
They’re on the roof Max looks up The ceiling caves in

Max is trapped in a world of cold white

He claws his way out of the top and we see his face red
wet with snow and tears He’s cold and humiliated

The two boys see how upset Max is They pull back feeling
awful They walk back across the street

A horn honks - everyone is waiting The boys run back to the
car

Max hurt and shamed looks for Claire among the teenagers
He finds her Max and Claire lock eyes Claire looks worried
and feels bad for Max Max hopes that Claire will come over
to help and comfort him - even to stick up for him

( )

WTWTA Revised November 21 2008 (Buff) pg 4

But she doesn’t She turns away to talk to someone in the
car The car with Claire in it drives away

Shaken and raw Max runs to the house
INT MAX’S HOME - LATE AFTERNOON (CONTINUOUS)

Max enters his house covered in snow and runs upstairs into
Claire’s room

Max rips off his hat and gloves and throws them on the floor
He jumps up and down on Claire’s bed dumping snow
everywhere On her dresser he sees an elaborate valentine
that he made her out of popsicle sticks and construction
paper It says “To Claire Love Max” He grabs it and tears
it to pieces

As he calms down he realizes what he’s done He picks up the
pieces of the valentine and walks to his room

CUT TO
INT MAX’S BEDROOM
Max lays in bed silent worried On the dresser next to his
bed is a globe an antique lit from within Max reads the
inscription on a small brass panel on the globe
TO MAX OWNER OF THIS WORLD Love Dad
He hears high heels clicking in the kitchen below Max looks
forlorn wishing he hadn’t done what he’s done His mom’s
footsteps echo through the house getting closer to the
stairs
MOM
(calling out)
Hey I’m home
We hear her walking upstairs She enters the room and sees
Max under his covers She sits down on his bed and kisses his
head She’s wearing her work clothes - a wool skirt and white
cotton blouse

MOM (CONT’D)
Hey

Max doesn’t answer

MOM (CONT’D)
What’s wrong

Max looks up

( )

WTWTA Revised November 21 2008 (Buff) pg 5

MAX
Claire and her stupid friends
smashed my igloo

MOM
Oh

MAX
And she didn’t do anything about
it

MAX (CONTD)
I’m sorry honey
(with a sly smile)
I would have done something about
it

The guilt overtakes Max
INT CLAIRE’S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

He brings his mom into Claire’s room Water squishes
underfoot

MOM
Max what have you done

She leaves the room and comes back with a stack of towels
They both drop to their knees to soak up the mess

MOM (CONT’D)
(under her breath)
Oh my god

INT MOM’S OFFICE AREA — NIGHT (LATER)

Max’s mom works at home at night in a room at the rear of the
house Overlooking the backyard it’s a room used for many
purposes Outside the snow has turned to rain and it’s
coming down silver streaks outside the window

Mom is typing on her computer an older model while talking
on the phone to a co-worker Max enters the room tentatively

Feeling a bit guilty about earlier Max wants to make up with
his mom He fiddles with a few things in the room circling
his mom without overtly asking for attention

Mom still not paying any mind to Max looks anxious - but
more than that simply tired and worn out As she continues
her phone conversation we catch only glimpses of her from
Max’s point of view

MOM

(hiding her exhaustion with

warmth )
No I don’t want to bother you
just just quickly can you tell
me exactly what Mr Lasseter didn’t
like about the report
--Well what am I suppose to do
No I’m just tired and there’s been
some stuff here at home So what
can I do to fix this

Max trying to make her smile adopts the posture of a robot

She looks over to him He continues walking robot-style and
turns his head to smile at her not noticing he’s about to
walk into the wall He falls down to comic effect His mom
buries a laugh and puts her finger to her lips telling Max
to shush Max grins Success

MOM (CONTD)

(into the phone)
I know I know I uh but I
better get started if I’m gonna
turn it in in the morning

He plops himself on the floor under her desk and looks at his
mom’s feet She’s taken off her shoes but is still wearing
her tights Max tugs gently on the tights over her right toe

MOM (CONTD)

(now a bit more upbeat)
No I hear you I hear you This
will be the last time I promise
okay Thanks

She hangs up and smiles down at Max
MOM (CONTD)
(softly)
Hey
MAX
(almost inaudibly)
Hi

MOM

MAX
Ummm Sure

This is a game they play together Max looks around trying
to think of a good one to tell her She opens a new page on
her computer and starts typing his dictation

MAX (CONTD)
Okay there were some buildings
There were these really tall
buildingsand they could walk
Then there were some vampires One
of the vampires bit the tallest
building and his fangs broke
offthen all his other teeth fell
outthen he started cryingand
then all the other vampires said
Why are you crying Aren’t those
just your baby teeth And he said
No those are my grown-up
teethand the vampires knew that
he couldn’t be a vampire anymore
so they left him

Mom finishes typing and smiles proudly and sadly at Max

Max smiles

MAX (CONTD)
The end

back at his mom 25-27

INT SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

The classroom is a familiar one - Formica furniture and a
chalkboard large windows The branches of nearby trees touch
the glass when the wind surges

Maxs teacher male is short and thin bearded and wearing a

cardigan

TEACHER

(warming to his subject)

the sun is the center of our
solar system It’s the reason all
the planets are here Its warmth
gives us sunlight makes our planet
liveable Of course the sun won’t
always be here to keep us warm It
like all things will die and
when it does first it’1ll expand
enveloping all the surrounding
planets including Earth before
consuming them rapidly

(now almost cheerfully)
The sun after all is just fuel

burning ferociously and when it
runs out of fuel well

lived will someday be gone

Mom and boyfriend toast
Max watches in disgust Mom picks up a dirty plate and
hurries back toward the kitchen Passing Max she growls

Max follows her into the kitchen

33 INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 33
His mom is cooking Max enters the kitchen and drags a chair

over to the counter lazily It scrapes loudly on the floor

MOM

Shhh

Max starts sniffing around He looks down his nose at all the

food examining it Mom is too frazzled to pay attention He
gets up on the chair and assesses the work his mom is doing
At the moment she’s boiling water in a pot

( )
WTWTA Revised November 21 2008 (Buff) pg 10

MOM (CONTD)
Hey shhh
MAX
(pointing to something on a
plate)

MOM

Max rolls his eyes and moves on dissatisfied imperious He
fiddles with things on the counter He picks up a bag of
frozen corn

MAX
Frozen corn What’s wrong with

He drops the package loudly on the counter

MOM
(firmly trying not to lose
her patience)
Frozen corn is real And get off

MAX
(yelling more or less in his
mom’s face)
CLAIRE GET YOUR STUFF OFF THE
DINING ROOM TABLE

MOM
(urgently under her breath)
Max don’t pull that now

Instead of retreating Max leaps to stand on the counter He
stands there hovering over her in his animal costume

They stare at each other

surprise she chases him When they pass in front of the
boyfriend the boyfriend takes notice of the escalating
volume and urgency

35 In the front hall she catches him grabs him and holds him 35
roughly

MOM

Max What’s wrong with you

Max thrashes around in his mom’s grip He kicks and squirms
and losing all control he suddenly bites his mother’s arm
She shrieks She drops him on the floor He falls down ina
lump She steps back holding her arm in pain
MOM (CONTD)

(completely enraged)

OW Max you bit me That hurt

Max is shocked by what he’s done instantly realizing that

Close on Max we see that though he’s not sure what this
means these words have hit him hard

Max turns to see the boyfriend entering the foyer
As Mom is still in pain the boyfriend hesitates - he’s
unsure if it’s his place to get involved He stands
BOYFRIEND
Connie he can’t treat you like
that

Mom turns to Max

MOM
Max what is wrong with you Why
are you doing these things
MAX
You’re doing things
MOM
You’re out of control
Max looks at everyone His mom the boyfriend
MAX -

It’s not my fault -

This is the last straw with Max He turns red with rage and
runs out of the house into the night His mom runs out the

door after him

36 EXT STREET - NIGHT 36
MOM -

Max Max -

Max tears down the street

MOM (CONTD) -

Max -

37 She follows him for a block but quickly loses ground 37-
Max cuts across yards and down an embankment Now he’s free

He runs toward the forest in the distance where the road

ends and the trees begin

38 EXT NEARBY FOREST - NIGHT 38

Max still high from the run and still breathing hard comes
into the forest

38 38

He reaches a small clearing around a fallen tree where he
has a few possessions stashed Max grabs a large stick and
stomps around hitting things violently

The wind blows louder whipping the leaves around in a fury
Max feeling the nights power howls into the sky
39 He finds himself at the shore The stars are out and the 39

moon is reflected on the placid water

A boat floats Max looks around to see if anyone is there
The boat isn’t tied to anything and starts to drift away
Max rushes toward it and grabs the loose rope attached to it
He pulls the boat back slowly He looks around again
wondering if the boat has an owner if anyone’s watching He
stands before the boat the trees swaying violently around

him

Max steps into the boat
The vessel slowly drifts away

40-42 Max allows the boat to drift watching seriously and 40-42
intentionally as the land grows more distant

43 The boat cuts quickly through the sea 43
Max looks past the bow toward his destination There is
nothing but open water

44 EXT OCEAN - DAWN 44x
A pale early light paints the ocean pink We see a wide wide
shot with Max and his boat a tiny speck in the vast ocean

45 On board we see Max look around at the horizon line In 45
front of him no signs of the city Behind him is just water
and sky No land in sight

46-55 He settles in for a long journey 46-55
Max sails in and out of nights and days He’s hungry and
thirsty Rain comes and goes He’s cold and wet and exhausted
-- and it seems he’1ll never see land again
Finally after many days off the bow of the boat he sees a
landmass and within it a bright glow

56 Cut Night He’s closer now The island is in sight A great 56
black mound in the sea with an orange glow - a fire - in the

middle

WIWTA Revised November 21 2008 (Buff) pg 14

EXT ISLAND - NIGHT

Landing on the beach is rough-going The surf is thundering
and Max’s boat is tossed about like a toy

When he’s close enough he jumps from the boat gasping from
the water’s cold He gets his bearings and pulls the boat
ashore He stands and assesses the island

Beyond the beach and the bluffs above he sees a forest with
a large fire raging The flames ebbs and flow bursting
periodically like a growing bonfire

There are sounds of chaos in the distance audible even from
the beach Max wet and cold knows his only chance at
survival is to climb the cliffs and move toward the warmth of
the fire

Max skulks through the foliage like a cat This is a truly
dangerous muddy forest - wild primal and unpredictable As
the sounds get louder Max comes upon a clearing

Through the trees Max sees an enormous fire Around it are
ten large huts made of interlocking branches Max stays low
A huge creature appears in silhouette backlit by the fire
Hiding in the grass Max watches enthralled

Max studies this creature as he walks around crushing one of
these huts with his enormous arms This beast is CAROL --
huge striped and with two horns atop his head

CAROL
That’s it Tear em all down Tear
‘em down Come on We’ve got a few
more to go over here
(beat)
Is anyone going to help me

JUDITH
Who said that we didn’t like them

JUDITH is female with two horns and one prominent at the end
of her huge snout Her voice is sardonic and sharp-edged

IRA
We liked them They were nice

IRA is close to Judith and has a huge oval nose and sad
eyes He speaks like a tired old man

CAROL
But I know what I’m doing

From far away Carol hears a sound It sounds like a small
animal growling

Carol looks around to see what this noise is It’s getting
louder Everybody looks around to see what it is

Suddenly Max bursts into the scene flying through the side
of a hut He startles everybody Wildly he swings a huge
stick around destroying everything in his path

JUDITH
Ira what is it

IRA
I don’t know

JUDITH
Doesn’t smell like anything

Carol watches Max excited by what he sees but also unsure
about who or what this thing is

As Max is smashing stuff he exchanges glances with Carol
Max hurls himself into one of the huts and lands on the

ground in a comic thud Carol approaches Max looms over him

and sniffs him Max is nervous but sniffs Carol back They
growl at each other Carol laughs

CAROL
(to the others)

See this guy gets it

huts He smashes it and creates a large hole Inside the hut

Max is surprised to see a large and menacing bull-like

creature THE BULL Max is frightened and backs off When he
turns around he bumps into Douglas who looms over him

DOUGLAS

Hey what are you doing

Oh he’s probably got those little
bird bones

backed into a corner He has to do something

IRA

The Wild Things continue to close in on him He arches his
back and lets out a voice much greater and more commanding
than we could ever expect

Why

Max is acting like he’s casting a spell on them

The Wild Things freeze in their tracks All is silent Carol

There’s a split second when Max can’t believe it worked But
there’s still tension

Max continues trying to stare the Wild Things down

MAX
Because you can’t eat me You
didn’t know that so I forgive you
But don’t try it again

Why not

They wear horn hats and they’re

fortress They tried to cave in the
roof but I’d made it too strong I
told them to be still but they
didn’t I conquered them I had to
make their heads explode And then
they realized I knew all the
secrets to the world And then you
know what happened They made me
their king

Carol has been listening intently and nodding during Max’s

story

Wow

You were a king I knew there was
something special about him I told
you guys

The other Wild Things are trying to take this all in
overwhelmed with all of this new information

So wait you exploded their heads

femur and gives it to Carol

Max runs up a small incline to a clearing on top of a cliff
He circles a tree dragging his claws on it The Wild Things
do the same but their claws shred the bark off of it

They all run up to the cliff howling with Max Because Max
is standing close to the edge and they’re careless they
almost knock him off the cliff with someone’s hip Carol
immediately catches Max and places him back on the ground
It’s comic but also reminds us that there’s danger still on
this island

Together Max and the Wild Things stand at the edge of the
cliff howling into the air over the vast ocean below

destination Carol’s standing in the entrance It’s an

Up ahead Carol looks around to make sure no one has followed
them and disappears inside

moment then steps inside

The room is large a studio of some kind It’s messy but
full of projects Max enters and slowly walks around taking
everything in

On the main worktable an entire city is laid out almost

20 feet long and six feet tall - buildings shaped like
mountains and hills in an organized almost grid-like format
Carol scurries about preparing his creation anxious about
what Max will think

The details are immaculate and painstaking It looks like it

and drops them They land with a huge and satisfying crash
atop a great pile of other trees

Carol and Douglas are trying to determine the placement of
the foundation Ira stands nearby on a small pile of rocks
being the place-marker Carol is holding Douglas like a

watches Carol Carol is scratching the ground anxious and
restless It scares Max

INT FORT SITE - MORNING

The sky is overcast Max is inside the fort pacing out
dimensions drawing an outline of something on the wall

Carol walks up and notices Max’s markings on the wall

CAROL
Hey Max What’s that

MAX
Um Well I was thinking we
needed a place where the king is
secret Like a secret chamber for
the king

Carol looks at the fort tilting his head

CAROL
Well I don’t understand What

MAX
Well you know like a like a
small place With a door that’s not
so big

When Carol begins to understand the implications here his
feelings get bruised

CAROL
(pondering)
I don’t know
(studying the fort)
I just didn’t picture it with
secret doors
(pause as he collects his
thoughts and thinks of a way
out of this)
What if it were a big place with
big secret doors

MAX

at him with sand pouring out of his shoulder

The rest of the Wild Things are shocked But it becomes clear

that this kind of thing isn’t unprecedented

Carol is crying hysterically as he chases Max toward the -
forest both of them at full speed Max darts through a low -
small opening in the dense forest - too small for Carol to -
fit through Carol crashes head first into the trees -

The forest is too dense Carol grinds to a halt stuck in the -
trees Max ploughs on rushing through the dense woods
Carol watches him escape -

Max continues through the woods He breaks through the -
foliage onto a forest path -

108 Max runs down the path The sound of Carol yelling echoes in 108
the distance Max is looking back trying to see where Carol
is and runs full-speed into KW

KW

Cmon C’mon Cmere

KW has a look of desperation on her face and Max spends a
split second trying to read it Carol is getting closer

She grabs his arm and yanks him off the path
Carol runs by growling ferociously Hes terrifying now
without any trace of the more civilized or charming Carol

Now hes pure id a raging animal

KW (CONTD)
Get in get inside

MAX
What

KW has her mouth open and is indicating that Max should
crawl into her

KW
Get in Crawl inside my mouth
I’1l hide you

The growling of Carol gets louder Max realizes that he has -

no choice He starts tentatively to crawl into KWs
mouth Once he’s half-way in she swallows him whole
109 Max lands inside of KW where there are some rocks and sticks 109-

and “Richard” the raccoon Richard is hanging out eating -
some twigs He and Max make eye contact -

He turns defeated and walks off -
Close on Max He feels for Carol -

KW breathing hard walks into a small dark clearing
covered with fallen trees and pools of liquid -

KW -
(repeating Carol) -
Can you believe him -

MAX -
He doesn’t mean to be that way -
KW He’s just scared -

KW
(softening somewhat)
Well he only makes it harder And -
it’s hard enough already -

MAX
(thinking about his own -
behavior)
I know (beat) But he loves you -
Youre his family -

KW thinks about this for a minute

KW
Yeah I guess
MAX
I can’t breathe that well in here
Can you get me out

Close on Max Finally a big hand reaches in and retrieves
Max taking him toward the light KW tilts her head back
and draws him out of her throat After hes been extracted
they sit together exhausted

Max looks up at her seeing how hard it is for her Then he
looks down contemplating this a new thought enters his

head
MAX (CONTD)
I wish you guys had a mom -
KW says nothing seeming to acknowledge the truth in this

by the destruction
On the floor amid the wreckage Max sits and begins to work
He takes pieces of the debris and splinters of wood and
begins to arrange something on the floor though we dont see
what exactly it is -
EXT CLIFF ABOVE FORT 104A -
Max runs toward the fort As he approaches he looks over and -
sees Carol and Douglas sitting together Douglas stands
excusing himself so that Max and Carol can talk There’s a

stick attached to Douglas’s shoulder where his arm should be

DOUGLAS

Max

Douglas walks off patting Carol on the back affectionately
as he goes

CAROL
(as if this question might
answer it all)
So whatever happened with you and
the Vikings

Well in the end I had to leave

shallow water
INT CAROLS STUDIO - DAY 113

Carol storms into the workshop still upset Carol stops -
short noticing Maxs gift on the floor below him His rage
quickly dissipates as he sees a heart made of the debris from

the studio a heart much like that which Carol made for Max
earlier Inside the heart is the letter Cc -

Carol takes it all in and sits down before it He traces the 114

outline of the heart with his claw Hes utterly overcome
He begins to weep

Standing in the water KW lifts Max into the boat As he
stands on the bow they embrace

KW
Don’t go I’1ll eat you up I love
you so

Max hugs her goodbye and is now ready to sail off

As theyre pushing the boat into the water we hear a great
rustling through the forest They all look up

Carol comes running from the forest onto the beach but slows
down as soon as he and Max lock eyes

Max looks at him warily Carol respecting this stops at a
distance from Max Carol looks down standing as if his hands
were in his pockets wanting to say something but not
knowing what

Max begins to drift into the ocean Max and Carol look at
each other as Max continues to float away

Carol walks toward the boat across the beach wanting
desperately to do or say something eventually walking past
the other Wild Things and wading waist-deep into the ocean
Max watches conflicted Their eyes have been locked the
entire time Carol looks so sorry but doesn’t know what he
can possibly say Max watching Carol - who is now up to his
chest in the ocean - emits a sad mournful gentle howl

MAX
Aroooooo

We can almost hear Maxs voice cracking Carols spirits lift
- he sees this as a small sign of Maxs forgiveness

CAROL
(mournful in return)
Arooooooo
There are a few moments when Max and Carols howls overlap as
Max drifts into the sea Finally the other Wild Things join
in all howling sorrowfully in concert to their departing
friend KW howls goodbye too

lights are still on He runs toward it until he gets a few
houses away when he slows down to a jog then a walk
