FADE IN

From the BLACKNESS before the first images we hear a young
womans tortured SCREAM muffled by her own will We see her
mouth open in agony her face beaded with sweat Her name
is ANNE and she is Queen of France She lies in

A ROYAL BEDCHAMBER

The royal DOCTOR kneels at the foot of her bed her own royal
mother grips her hands

On the opposite side of the huge bedchamber and separated

from the queens bed by an artistically painted screen are
royal ADVISORS sweating and anxious for any word to take to
their king They wince as the Queen moans again in the pain
of childbirth

Her fingers claw out for help but her Doctor ignores her
need to be touched and comforted he is concerned only for
the baby Only her PRIEST FATHER BELLES sits at her head
stroking her hair gently and rapidly whispering prayers

DOCTOR
The head is born One arm the
other arm it is a boy

The advisors disregarding the Queens privacy scurry around
the screen to see the doctor lift the beautiful baby wet
with birth The mother -- the Queen -- is still in agony
yet she struggles to lift her head

ADVISOR 1
I shall tell the king

ADVISOR 2
I shall tell him

They hurry for the door But their race to be first to bring
this great news to the King is interrupted as the Queen emits

another cry it surprises the doctor

DOCTOR
Mlady

He kneels again to examine the Queen

DOCTOR
Another It is another
The joy vanishes from the faces of the advisors They look
gravely at each other as they hear a second BABYS CRY

SMASH TO
A DARK COURTYARD - NIGHT

A door groans open in a hidden corner of the palace courtyard
and into the darkness steps a dashing figure His face is
hidden in shadow but we know from the silhouette of his
cloak and plumed hat that he is a MUSKETEER

He carries an OBLONG BASKET

A carriage is just rattling onto the flagstones of the
courtyard The Musketeer steps into its interior with a
sharp word to the driver --

MUSKETEER
Away

The whip CRACKS and the carriage plunges into the night
TIME DISSOLVE
EXT ESTABLISHING THE ISLAND FORTRESS PRISON - DAY

On a gash of rock thrusting upward from the sea along the
southern coast of France stands an island fortress a prison
like an Alcatraz of the Mediterranean Just off a coastline
renowned for its beauty the fortress is horrible and
foreboding As we SUPERIMPOSE

TWENTY-TWO YEARS LATER

INT THE FORTRESS PRISON

With the camera as our moving POV we survey the prison It
is a horrible place dungeons where prisoners lie in their
own filth corners where jailers rut with unresisting captive
women long twisting corridors lined with cells from which
prisoners whimper or moan in madness Up a long winding
staircase our POV moves we push through the barred window of
a cell It is somewhat cleaner than the rest of the places
weve seen but still a prison We PAN the cell

And we see a man A MAN IN AN IRON MASK It is terrifying
to think of anyone imprisoned in this way We push in on his
eyes They are blue childlike

A greasy jailer -- the prisoners KEEPER -- puts his face to
the barred window of the door and speaks with bored cruelty

KEEPER
You dead yet

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
No Keeper

DISSOLVE TO
EXT ESTABLISHING PARIS - DAY
SUPERIMPOSE
PARIS
EXT PARIS STREET - NIGHT

Through the narrow streets of the old city gallops a dashing
figure his cloak flying behind him and catching the
moonlight his horses hooves clattering along the
cobblestones as he dodges the beggars living in the filthy
shadows He is a magnetic sight riding the horse as easily
as if they were racing across an open field and not through a
cluttered street and guiding the stallion as if its grace
and power came not from the animal but from the rider
Sitting lightly in the saddle is

DARTAGNAN

famous Musketeer Captain of the Kings Royal Bodyguard He
is still handsome at mid-life still erect unambiguous in
his courage and his loyalty

He rides past a knot of angry beggars moving through the
streets breaking windows and scavenging for food When they
see dArtagnan some throw rocks at him They sail by
dArtagnans head he ducks them with the fluid grace of a
boxer dodging punches and keeps on riding

OUTSIDE THE CATHEDRAL

DArtagnan rides into the courtyard of a grand old residence
beside Notre Dame Cathedral Priests are dispensing food to
beggars gathered in the courtyard As dArtagnan reins his

horse to a stop the wretched people stare with contempt at
the royal symbols on his uniform But dArtagnan is not a
man anyone would be quick to confront as he dismounts and
moves toward the doorways the people part for him

He pauses as he sees parked to one side of the old
residence a big rickety carriage DArtagnan smiles

DARTAGNAN
Porthos too

DArtagnan hears drunken feminine giggles echoing down the
staircase of the tower above him

INT PRIESTS RESIDENCE - A STAIRWAY - DAY

Four people are moving up a winding stairway three are
women bosoms spilling from their gaudy dresses the fourth
is PORTHOS the former Musketeer now a nobleman of great
wealth and even greater girth He and the women are drinking
wine as they stagger up the stairs the women towing Porthos
like rowboats tugging a ship to dock Porthos is not so
drunk that his hands fail to find pleasant places to grip
their bodies as they walk and giggle

PORTHOS
Ah ha Here we are Aramis
Porthos is here

They reach a doorway Porthos kicks it open staggers back
and begins shoving the women inside

INT A PRIESTS APARTMENT - DAY

The first of the partying women tumbles inside she stops
short at what she sees The second and third stumble in
after her and they too stop dead still sobered by what they
see Then with a great roar Porthos barrels in

PORTHOS
Aaaaaaaramis Porthos is --

He stops dead in his tracks From the POV OF PORTHOS AND THE
WOMEN we see ARAMIS Always the most theological of the
Musketeers and ruthlessly brilliant he is still lean and
powerful And still handsome or at least he would be but
now he kneels before a single candle at a private altar
wearing sackcloth and ashes in penitent prayer
PORTHOS
Sorry my dears You would have
enjoyed it too Hes hung like a
donkey

WENCH 1
So are you

PORTHOS
Really I havent been able to see
it for fifteen years Go on now
leave His Holiness alone Ill
bring you back tomorrow when hes in
a better mood

He whacks their bottoms herding them out then swaggers to
Aramis heaving himself to a seat beside his praying friend

PORTHOS
Please revel with me Aramis I need
my spirits lifted Im old Im
weak my strength is gone --

ARAMIS
Be quiet you fat fool Cant you
see Im praying

PORTHOS
I just said youre praying Are you
deaf too I know youre blind
because if you had seen the tits
that just walked out of here youd
have tears in your eyes

ARAMIS
(trying to ignore him)
There are more important things than
tits

PORTHOS
Really If you can name me one
thing one single thing that is
more sublime than the feel of a
plump pink nipple between my lips
I will buy you a new cathedral

Aramis is still trying to pray but rises to the bait

ARAMIS
Forgiveness

PORTHOS
Forgiveness

As if in reply Porthos lets rip an enormous rolling fart

PORTHOS
(beat)
Forgive me

Aramis fingers clamp down on the rosary beads as he tries
to keep praying

PORTHOS
Am I forgiven

Aramis abruptly backhands his huge friend Porthos reels
backwards landing in a chair

PORTHOS
I observe your forgiveness isnt
sweeter than a plump nipple

ARAMIS
Cant you see Im praying
goddammit

Porthos raises a foot and kicks the bishop in the balls
Aramis staggers back and grabs a chair to throw it Porthos

picks up the whole table -- just as dArtagnan enters

PORTHOS AND ARAMIS
DArtagnan

Porthos tosses the table aside and bear hugs dArtagnan

PORTHOS
How are you you skinny little pup

Aramis sets the chair down in embarrassment

ARAMIS
A simple theological discussion

DARTAGNAN
Aramis -- the King wishes to see
you
ARAMIS
Still you serve him loyally --
though people hurl rotten eggs at
his royal emblem

Aramis lifts dArtagnans cloak as evidence near its hem
sure enough is the remnant of a broken egg

DARTAGNAN
I see your mind is sharp as ever
The King said Right away Cut

deep and hard my friends

PORTHOS
Deep and hard DArtagnan

DArtagnan clasps Porthos hand then that of Aramis and
leaves as Porthos shakes his head

PORTHOS
We were all Musketeers once eh Oh
I forgot For the poor the ones
you were praying for

He hands a purse to Aramis Surprised even touched Aramis
reaches for it Just as he takes the money Porthos throws a
haymaker but Aramis sees the sucker punch coming and ducks
Suddenly the two old warriors are circling again

PORTHOS
I wonder how Athos is doing

INT A SMALL HOUSE - DAY

ATHOS stands at the dressing table in a modest room dressed
in a dark plain coat he too is a former Musketeer -- gray
haired and handsome intensely intelligent with a hard crust
of manners masking seas of emotion He opens a small wooden
box and digs through medals of heroism he finds what hes
looking for just as his son RAOUL enters RAOUL is in his
mid-twenties he wears the uniform of a soldier in the French
Army He is nervous pacing looking at every angle in the
mirror

RAOUL
Do I look all right

ATHOS
None of the ladies will be able to
take their eyes off you

RAOUL
I care only about Michelle Should
I ask her when we first arrive
Or or when were leaving I
could ask her in the carriage -- but
it is more romantic at the palace
I get so confused

ATHOS
Perhaps this will help

He hands Raoul the simple gold ring he took from the box

RAOUL
Mothers ring I cant take this

ATHOS
She died giving you to me And I
want to die knowing it is one the
finger of the women my son loves

They embrace Athos eyes mist but he smiles

ATHOS
Now go and bring back your fiance

ESTABLISHING - THE ROYAL PALACE - DAY

The Palace glows golden in the Parisian sunshine Carriages
deposit guests for the lavish party in the royal gardens

EXT THE ROYAL PALACE - GARDENS - DAY

Attractive young adults strut about in the extravagant attire
of Louis XIVs France the men like peacocks the ladies in
gowns that seem to squeeze their entire bodies up into their
bosoms They laugh and smile and strike courtly poses
pretending to talk with each other -- but all eyes are on the
doorway through which the king is about to come

JUST BEYOND THAT PALACE DOORWAY

KING LOUIS the Fourteenth is having his wardrobe adjusted by
a flock of tailors He is twenty-two and would be quite
handsome except for the total self-absorption Hes
checking himself in a full length golden mirror as two of his
advisors PIERRE and CLAUDE try to speak with him

PIERRE
Your Majesty I know it is aa
festive time but before --

KING LOUIS
The blue sash No the burgundy

PIERRE
before the party begins --

KING LOUIS
The party has already begun -- so
why are you delaying me

PIERRE
We do not wish to delay you
Majesty but as your advisors we
feel it is our -- our --
CLAUDE
our duty
PIERRE
Yes It is our duty to let you
know there are riots in Paris
LOUIS

Riots My people live in the
worlds most beautiful city their
king has the grandest palaces on
earth Why should they feel
anything but pride and contentment

PIERRE
Well yes of course Majesty and
Im sure they are content except
that well they are starving

LOUIS
Sometimes the poor do grow hungry
But why would they riot about it

As he says this a replica of the Matterhorn made of fruits
and meringues is carried past the window by a team of chefs

PIERRE
Majesty We have more than enough
food set aside for your birthday
celebration next week If we
distributed some of that we would
have time to gather more before --

LOUIS
Aramis I have been expecting you
(to the tailors)
We are satisfied that will do

The tailors and advisors withdraw as Aramis -- still in his
simple priests robe -- strides forward and bows to the kind

ARAMIS
Your birthday celebration your
Majesty

LOUIS
Next week This is a mere garden
party -- and I wish to join it so I
will be brief I am experiencing
resistance from the Jesuits

ARAMIS
Well perhaps you should speak
with them your Majesty

LOUIS
I have demanded it -- and common
priests present themselves Can you
imagine the arrogance Common
Jesuit priests try to act as my
equals and they refuse to reveal
the names of anyone else in their
order No one can keep secrets like
the Jesuits can and the identity of
their leader is the darkest secret
they hold Even the Pope himself
does not know who leads the Jesuit
Order in France He suspects the
Governor General of Jesuits whoever
he is is angling to become Pope
himself

ARAMIS
How can I serve you in this

LOUIS
Perhaps you can find out who this
secret leader of the Jesuits is
You are now a priest but you were
once a Musketeer serving the throne
of France a throne ordained of God
Can you accept this mission and
keep it private

ARAMIS
If I find out the identity of this
Jesuit rebel I will kill both him
and the man who told me

LOUIS
Once a Musketeer always a
Musketeer eh

Aramis bows and Louis turns back to his mirror There are
mirrors everywhere in his palace and he loves his
reflection adorned as he is all in golden cloth like fabric
from the sun Aramis leaves and the advisors return

LOUIS
Ah yes the riots We have food
stocks on the wharves right now no

PIERRE
That food has spoiled That is why
it was not shipped to the army

LOUIS
Exactly why it should be given away

PIERRE
What an excellent idea your
Majesty

EXT PALACE GARDENS - DAY
Among the guests are Raoul and MICHELLE a stunningly
beautiful young woman Michelle is awed by the richness all

around them while Raoul sees only her He holds the ring

MICHELLE
Isnt it glorious

RAOUL
Michelle

But just as he starts to speak trumpets blast and the King
steps through the doors and out into the lavish gardens the
party goers give him a rousing ovation Raoul returns the
ring to his jacket to wait for another moment

Everyone watches the King who begins guzzling wine and
telling jokes to his sycophants who howl at the Kings
witticisms Then Louis catches sight of Raoul and Michelle
and lowers his voice to his FRIENDS

LOUIS
Who is that

FRIEND 1
Raoul son of Athos

LOUIS
Not the soldier you idiot

FRIEND 2
Her name is Michelle

The king is transfixed
DARTAGNAN

is presiding over a huddle of fresh faced young Musketeers
directing them to their positions around the gardens like
secret service agents protecting a president He leaves
them and quickly moves to the King

DARTAGNAN
Your Majesty

LOUIS
What is it dArtagnan Assassins
falling from the sky now

The sycophants laugh loudly

DARTAGNAN
The plans for use of the maze were
not disclosed to me

LOUIS
I decided it this morning

DARTAGNAN
Then you must allow me to stay close
to you so that --
LOUIS
I am King dArtagnan I will
change my mind as I wish and I will
enjoy my banquet as I wish

DARTAGNAN
But I deployed the Royal Guards
according to your previous --

LOUIS
Let us play a game dArtagnan let
us pretend I am King and you are
Captain of my Musketeers Let us
behave as if my wish is law And my
wish is to enjoy this party

DArtagnan bows sharply as the young sycophants chuckle
DArtagnan retreats then looks back to Louis and follows his
gaze to the tender young beauty who caught his eye
DArtagnan recognizes Raoul son of his friend Athos

RAOUL AND MICHELLE

As the guests mix and mingle Raoul tries again

RAOUL
Michelle I Ever since I returned
Ive been wanting to speak with you
about about --

A gaunt SERVANT interrupts presenting a tray of delicacies

SERVANT
Monsieur Mademoiselle

RAOUL
No Thank you -- Michelle I --

They are interrupted by the SQUEAL of a piglet squirming in
the hands of the kings dwarf who holds the fat little
animal above his head and runs among the startled guests

LOUIS
It pleases us to announce an
entertainment for our guests A
contest of agility and cunning

He takes the pig from his dwarf the pig is clean and
perfumed a colorful fake horn tied onto its head
LOUIS
Behold our unicorn Whichever of
our guests captures the unicorn
shall win its treasure

With this announcement the King produces a diamond the size
of a pecan suspended from a ribbon the guests gasp at its
richness The King ties the diamond around the pigs neck

RAOUL AND MICHELLE
Michelle is amazed at this

MICHELLE
I have never seen a diamond so
large

It almost makes Raoul ashamed of the modest ring hidden in
his hand

LOUIS
Into the maze All of you
Disperse I command you

The dwarf releases the pig poking him through a tiny break
in the hedge the critter skitters as only a pig can eluding
the first laughing lunges of the guests

THE PIG CHASE is a merry melee as the maze becomes a tangle
of confusion LOUIS climbs to a platform above the top of
the ten foot hedge that forms the maze From his perch he
looks down on all the action and calls encouragement

LOUIS
Are you men or mice

MICHELLE squeals as the pig scurries by and Raoul dives for
it He almost has the pig then it kicks free

RAOUL
The pendant will be yours

With that he races after the pig
MICHELLE tries to follow this way that way through the

maze Then she stops face to face with the King entering
through a gate hidden in one of the mazes dead corners
LOUIS
Michelle isnt it

Speechless she nods

LOUIS
I would have said it was impossible
but I believe the excitement of the
chase has made you even more
beautiful

MICHELLE
Sire I --

LOUIS
You blush You do not wish to be
beautiful to your King

Her eyes go still she understands what is happening

FROM BEHIND THE GATE we see dArtagnan watching as Louis
tries to seduce the young woman Even as dArtagnan watches
the pig comes rooting through the hedge with a deft movement
dArtagnan catches the animals leg and lifts it with the
sureness of the farm boy he once was The pig is quiet and
comfortable in dArtagnans hands

DArtagnan watches as the King approaches Michelle and she
allows him to touch her cheek The king leans to kiss her
Michelle does not move

WHHEEEKKKK The pig sails over the gate and hits the ground
running right at Louis feet it sets him dancing

The spell of the kings royal attention is shattered as the
pig scrambles away Michelle backs away

LOUIS
Wait Michelle I --

Too late he sees the shadow of the man looming above him
leaping down onto him from the observation platform It is
the servant who offered the tray to Raoul and Michelle he
has armed himself with a knife from the carving table and is
diving now to plunge the blade into the kings throat

The king is helpless frozen The assassin leaps falling
toward the king and is impaled on the sword of dArtagnan
springing through the gate to save his king
Michelle screams the king gasps and the assassin drops
mortally wounded They stare down at him now the would-be
assassin gurgles words through his agony

ASSASSIN
Feed your people

Party guests having heard Michelle scream are running in to
find them Michelle rushes off to find Raoul several
people are coming up

ASSASSIN
Your people starve Feed --

The king snatches out his own dagger and imperiously cuts the
throat of the dying man to stop these offensive words The
king looks at his stunned subjects

LOUIS
A pitiful madman nothing more
Come let us continue our chase
Where is our unicorn

The King prances away It takes the guests a moment but
they know that only gaiety will please their King and off
they go again laughing as if nothing happened

DArtagnan stands still as the young Musketeers under his
command come rushing up with swords drawn

YOUNG MUSKETEER
Captain

Seeing the dead assassin their eyes fill with admiration

YOUNG MUSKETEER
You are the best --

DArtagnan cant even listen with a last glance at the King
he turns quickly and walks away

INT FORTRESS PRISON

The Man in the Iron Mask sits on the floor A key rattles in
the lock and his keeper shuffles in carrying food

KEEPER
Food moron
MAN IN THE IRON MASK
Thank you Keeper

Not watching what hes doing the bulbous keeper trips on
something and stumbles dropping the food The prisoner
jumps to his feet concerned

KEEPER
Look what youve done

He picks up the tray and slings it at the prisoner

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
Im sorry Keeper

The keeper looks for what he tripped on -- a worn Bible He
snatches it up and grabs a hunk of pages from its middle

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
No Keeper its my only book

Hearing the pleading in the prisoners voice the keeper
looks squarely at him -- and rips out the pages

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
What number did you tear out

KEEPER
Eh

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
What number on the first page

KEEPER
Two-thirty-seven

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
Two-thirty-seven And the
descendants of Japeth are these
Obediah Zebulon Hezekiah

As the prisoner rattles off the names of Biblical genealogy
the jailer gawks at the pages in his hand

KEEPER
Youve memorized

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
What was the end page
As the keeper is speechless the prisoner looks for himself

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
Six-two-one Though I speak
with the tongues of men and angels
and have not love I am but a
clanging cymbal or --

The Keeper staggers in shock the prisoner bubbles with joy
MAN IN THE IRON MASK
Were playing Keeper A game
Take another page any page Keeper

and I are playing a game

And the prisoner takes the keepers fat hands in his own and
begins to dance and sing

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
A game a game were playing a --

The keepers left arm goes rigid and he clutches his chest
with his right hand he drops upon the stone floor

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
Keeper

The prisoner approaches the jailer the man is stoned dead
MAN IN THE IRON MASK
No No Keeper please you

cannot die Youre my only friend

The prisoner tries to wipe his eyes but he cant get at
them inside the mask He edges to the open door

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
Help Someone Keeper is dead

He slumps down beside the open door and weeps
INT PALACE - DARTAGNANS ROOM - EVENING
DArtagnans room is spartan a cot and weapons laid ona

plain table It has a single small window and dArtagnan
stands at it now looking out into the Palace garden below
The guests have all gone home the party pavilions have been
cleared away And now in the blue dusk a solitary lady
walks She is Anne of Austria the Queen Mother the lady we
saw in the opening

Now twenty years later she is a slim frail figure Her
clothes are drab and simple like the dress of mourning she

walks in silence watched at a distance by nun attendants

She glances up and sees dArtagnans form in the window
When he sees her looking he pulls away from the window

INT PALACE CORRIDOR - EVENING

DArtagnans room is along the same corridor as the Royal
Apartments DArtagnan sits at the small table going over
paperwork Through his open door he sees that Anne and her
attendants are filing along in the corridor and he rivets
his eyes back to his work

IN THE CORRIDOR

Anne reaches the door to her apartment and looks back to
where dArtagnans door is open

INT DARTAGNANS ROOM
The Queen Mothers ATTENDANT appears at dArtagnans door

ATTENDANT
She wishes a word with you

INT THE CORRIDOR

DArtagnan approaches the Queen Mother and bows

DARTAGNAN
Mlady

ANNE
I understand you saved my sons life
today

DARTAGNAN

God smiled upon us

ANNE
And you were not hurt
DARTAGNAN
No Mlady

ANNE
That is good

Without a change of expression on her still beautiful but sad
face she enters her room

INT DARTAGNANS ROOM - EVENING

DArtagnan returns to his room just as a young LIEUTENANT of
Musketeers (Andre) arrives with two of the Royal Guards

LIEUTENANT
Duty lists of the day Captain

DARTAGNAN
Thank you Andre

They hand him the list and salute again to leave
DARTAGNAN
Wait There is an entry here --
Messenger sent by King to residence
of Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort
Why was that

The young Musketeers try not to smirk

LIEUTENANT
Well Captain

INT ATHOS APARTMENT - NIGHT
Athos sits alone playing a haunting melody on a violin It
is a sad tune played with feeling he stops as he hears a

KNOCK at his door and opens it to --

ATHOS
DArtagnan

DARTAGNAN
Athos my friend

They embrace with deep affection -- friends who have shared
each others darkest times

DARTAGNAN
Its been too long

ATHOS
Life is too long Except when we
have our friends Look at you
Youre still a boy Sit sit Ill
open a bottle of wine

DArtagnan takes one of the wooden chairs by the meager
fire The whole place is modest at best

DARTAGNAN
Thanks but not for me

ATHOS
You cant drink with a friend you
havent seen in months

DARTAGNAN
I have ordered a drill of the Royal
Guard for midnight and must be
clear-headed for it

ATHOS
Midnight Mon dieu Driving the
youngsters hard eh

DARTAGNAN
They must stay sharp There was an
attempt on the Kings life today

ATHOS
Another How many times have you
saved his life in this year alone
Three Four

DARTAGNAN
I heard your playing

ATHOS
I was feeling sorry for myself
Raoul is getting married he
proposed today I love that boy
beyond all measure Ive spent
everything I own to give him
education and opportunity Now he
has complete happiness and I mope

A cloud passes dArtagnans face he has something to tell
Athos

DARTAGNAN
Athos

But whatever it is that dArtagnan wants to say is
interrupted by the sound of someone climbing the stairs As
Athos face brightened with the arrival of dArtagnan now it
glows as he jumps up to welcome his son

ATHOS
That must be Raoul Raoul Look
dArtagnans come to visit
Whats wrong You look awful

RAOUL
Michelle she -- The king has
invited her to come live in the

palace
Athos is stunned dArtagnan witnesses this with agony

ATHOS
But -- are you sure

RAOUL
We were at her door I was just
taking the ring from my pocket for
the third time today when a young
Musketeer brought the invitation for
her to become a lady-in-waiting for
the Queen Mother

ATHOS
Michelle cannot possibly accept

RAOUL
She cannot possibly refuse Her
family is poor they have even less
money than we do And along with
the invitation the King sent the
diamond pendant from the piglet

ATHOS
Piglet -- What are you --

RAOUL
Never mind Papa it doesnt matter
now She loved me once I want to
die remembering that

ATHOS
Die What

RAOUL
I have rejoined the army and asked
to resume my commission at the head
of the troops of General Fromberge

ATHOS
Fromberge At the front No

RAOUL

It is already done I have just
stopped at Mothers grave to say
goodbye before coming to tell you

ATHOS
Raoul no You cannot do this No
matter how your heart is broken --

But Raoul stops him with an embrace

RAOUL
Goodbye father I am sorry

ATHOS
Raoul --

Raoul breaks away and runs from the room Athos so joyful
moments before holds his head as if his brain might erupt

ATHOS
This cannot be Everyone knows the
Queen Mother is a recluse and the
ladies-in-waiting are but
mistresses for the king

DARTAGNAN
If the young woman truly loves
Raoul --

ATHOS

Shes a woman dArtagnan From a
poor family You may still be young
enough to believe love conquers
everything but I am old and hard
and Ive seen too much Even when
kings are hunchbacks they have any
woman they desire because power
seduces even more than love

DArtagnan is silent and even ashamed Athos realizes

ATHOS
You knew this was happening You
knew and thats why you came

DARTAGNAN
I fear I know our King I came to
try to bring you hope

ATHOS
What hope is there A wartime
commission cannot be vacated except
by the king and what chance is
there of that Fromberge is on the
battle line and Raoul --

DARTAGNAN
I have dispatches a message to
Fromberge requesting that Raoul be
kept far from the fighting

ATHOS
Raoul is everything to me

DARTAGNAN
I know

ATHOS
Oh my friend

Athos grips dArtagnan in gratitude and desperate hope

DARTAGNAN
I will also speak with the King for
he is surely unaware of the problems
his invitation to Mademoiselle
Beaufort has caused

ATHOS
You trust his character more than
anyone else does

DARTAGNAN
Raoul is hurrying to the front so I
must hurry too

ATHOS
Save my son dArtagnan

They embrace once more and dArtagnan leaves
EXT PARIS STREETS - DAY

Magnificent public buildings -- palaces and cathedrals --
grace the citys skyline but here in central Paris all is
squalor On a narrow filthy street beggars bother the
sullen city peasants who are weak with hunger themselves

But interest perks up when two soldiers drive up in a wagon
and one of them Lieutenant Andre announces --

LIEUTENANT
Here is food the gift of your
loving King on his birthday He
gives to himself by giving to you
in that he loves you so much

Slowly at first the paupers stand and shuffle forward As
the soldiers begin handing out foodstuffs -- bread cabbages
tomatoes eggs -- those nearest the wagon begin to jostle
each other and a large crowd gathers quickly

LIEUTENANT
No need to fight there is plenty
for all

Its looking like a holiday celebration until a RUFFIAN
breaks open a loaf of bread and wrinkles his nose

RUFFIAN
This stuff stinks It is rotting
The King gives us rotten food

He hurls the moldy bread back at the soldiers Other paupers
sniff the food and its stink set off an explosion of anger
they throw food at the soldiers Then a paving stone
crashes through a shop window and suddenly its a riot with
the mob overwhelming the soldiers and dragging them down the
streets in the direction of the palace

DARTAGNAN riding toward the palace himself turns a corner
and sees the mob coming And they see him the elegant
dashing Musketeer on the prancing stallion
And at that moment two more soldiers race out of a side
street fleeing a similar mob coming from another direction
DArtagnan understands everything at a glance the second
pair of fleeing soldiers reach him in panic

PANICKED SOLDIER
Back toward the palace We cannot
hold them off We will fire a
volley into them

DARTAGNAN
No Run to the palace and close the
gates But do not fire

The two new soldiers race away dArtagnan waits calmly on
his horse as the mobs from both directions converge on him

THE MOB seeing the dashing Musketeer wait so confidently for
them slow up but the ruffian urges them on

RUFFIAN
o the palace

Come on

DArtagnan sits calmly in their way He doesnt even draw
his sword though members of the mob grab the reins of his

horse Some of the mob recognize him and murmur
MOB
Its dArtagnan Le Generale de
Musketeers
The mob hesitates -- for the name dArtagnan means heroism

and patriotism to all of them

RUFFIAN
One Musketeer cant stop us

DARTAGNAN
Stop you You are Frenchmen are
you not I am one of you

RUFFIAN
The King is a Frenchman but he is
not one of us

DARTAGNAN
Citizens of Paris Give ear to me
RUFFIAN
Well give you their ears

With that he draws a dagger from his filthy shirt and puts it
to the ear of the young Lieutenant who is already bloody from
being dragged through the street

DARTAGNAN
Wait -- and listen I beg you
RIOTER

They give us garbage not fit for
rats They think we are garbage

With that one of the rioters hurls a moldy beet at
dArtagnan who draws his sword in a slick liquid movement
he cuts the vegetable from the air

The display of expertise is startling Someone else throws a
head of lettuce dArtagnan slices it in half and as the
pieces fly he skewers one with the point of his sword

DARTAGNAN
Im on my way to a salad Doesnt
anybody have any endive

The mob laughs at this panache and the amazing display of
swordsmanship that lies behind it Someone tosses more
lettuce and dArtagnan divides and skewers this one as well
This time the crowd applauds

DARTAGNAN
A tomato

Can he do it Someone fires a tomato right at his head and
sure enough dArtagnan spears it Then with a victorious
flourish he takes a bite of it His face contorts with the
taste and he spits the pieces out the crowd is hushed

DARTAGNAN
You are right It is rotten I
will speak to the King myself You
have my word

The mob is completely won over by dArtagnan the ruffian
angry that his riot is fizzling raises his knife again over
the soldiers but now the point of dArtagnans sword flicks
to the ruffians neck
DARTAGNAN
And you will release those men --

for they serve France and you
RIOTERS

Three cheers for dArtagnan

Hurrah Hurrah

The soldiers who moments before were about to be ripped apart
now stand and look at dArtagnan in gratitude and awe The
mob has forgotten them they see only dArtagnan as he rakes
his blade clean returns it to its scabbard reins his horse
around and slowly rides away escorting the soldiers back
toward the palace

INT PALACE - NIGHT

DArtagnan strides into the long hallway leading to the royal
apartments As he reaches the door to the kings rooms he

finds a knot of royal advisors -- among them Pierre and
Claude -- gathered outside the kings door
CLAUDE

We already know about the riots

DARTAGNAN
Does he know

PIERRE
We will tell him when it is

CLAUDE
Convenient

Blocked by the advisors dArtagnan leaves them turning down
one hallway and then another he reaches the Hall of Mirrors
and touches the golden frame of one mirror at its corner the
mirror becomes a door revealing a secret passage within the
walls DArtagnan steps through and the portal closes again
leaving no trace of its existence

INT PALACE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Within a bed whose tapestried posts stretch to the sixteen

foot ceiling the king is making love the YOUNG WOMAN lying
beneath him is doing her best to sound sincere

YOUNG WOMAN
Oh yes So good Ooo wonderful
Marvelous Fan-tas --
Louis climaxes with a grunt She tries to sound pleased

YOUNG WOMAN
Oh Louis that was incredible It
was better than ever before It --

LOUIS
Im hungry

He hops up throwing on a silk robe embroidered in gold

YOUNG WOMAN
I will have food brought

LOUIS
I like to eat alone

He moves to what appears to be a wardrobe standing against
the far wall and opens its door revealing a secret
staircase hidden within the thick walls of the palace

LOUIS
By the way youll be moving
tomorrow

Leaving the girl without another word he moves down the
concealed stairs

INT THE KINGS BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

Louis reaches the bottom of the stairs disguised behind a
similar wardrobe in his own bedroom He steps out -- and is
startled as the lifesize portrait of Louis XIII on the other
side of the room opens to admit dArtagnan

LOUIS
Aaa DArtagnan These passages
were constructed for the Kings
security not so you could step from
my fathers portrait and startle me

to death

DARTAGNAN
It is for your security that I have
come your Majesty -- for the

security of your honor
LOUIS
I already know about the riots
dArtagnan I heard them out there
whispering Some fool gave the
order to distribute rotten food I
will deal with it tomorrow

DARTAGNAN
Then there is one more thing of an
even more personal nature

LOUIS
A personal nature

DARTAGNAN
Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort She
is betrothed to Raoul the son of
Athos the Musketeer who has served
France through many tribulations

The King begins to eat from the food laid out on the table

LOUIS
Betrothed I think not

DARTAGNAN
In his mind anyway and soon enough
in hers She had written him many
letters of love

The King pokes at his food

LOUIS
Miss Beaufort has accepted our
invitation By this we can only
suppose that she wishes to come --
as we wish her to be here

DARTAGNAN
Your Majesty has had many women --

LOUIS
That is my desire and my desire is
what should concern you not the
sentiments of some commoner

DARTAGNAN
It is not Raouls heart alone that
concerns me It is yours I know
you find women compliant --
especially the poorer ones like
Michelle But do they love you Do
you love them What about a queen
to love A son of your own

LOUIS
What quaint notions dArtagnan
But they contradict my father who
picked his queen when he was old
and only then to bear me

DARTAGNAN
There is more to love than he knew
or that you know

LOUIS
You dare criticize my father Or
lecture me

DARTAGNAN

Not criticize -- plead Love Love
your people and you will not bear
to see them hungry Love women and
they will love you Love yourself
and --

LOUIS
That is enough You are a good
servant dArtagnan but you forget
your place

DARTAGNAN
At least help Raoul

LOUIS
Silence I order you

DARTAGNAN
Order Fromberge to keep him in
safety It is the least you can do
to protect your own honor

LOUIS
I will consider it Now leave me

DARTAGNAN
Thank you your Majesty
DArtagnan bows steps to the lifesize portrait of Louis
XIII touches a hidden button on its frame and moves into the
secret passage the painting reveals as it swings open

CUT TO
CLOSE ON PIERRES FACE

He is sweating exceptionally pale as he tries to project
his voice past a huge lump in his throat

PIERRE
And I only say that the
rotten food was all my fault
and I take full responsibility
and beg the forgiveness of you all

He steps back having accomplished something terrifically
difficult and glances toward

THE KING

who steps to his advisor and shakes his hand whispering
quietly

LOUIS
Well done Pierre It will be good
for your soul that you have taken
responsibility for your errors And
dont worry I will look after your
family

Pierre can only nod He takes two steps kneels crosses
himself and places his head between two upright rails of

THE GUILLOTINE

The King Pierre and other attendants are standing on a
platform before a crowd of Parisians The blade drops
Pierres head hits the basket the crowd cheers

The King raises his hands to quiet the crowd

LOUIS
Do not rejoice -- but know that your
King does not tolerate blunders that
hurt his beloved people More food
is on its way and my advisors tell
me the new harvests are sure to be
bountiful

He shoots a glance at his advisors and they are pale from
the display theyve just witnessed

LOUIS
And I have new joys to announce to
you Today we decree a fresh glory
for Paris and for all of France
The laying of the foundations to
expand Versailles and make it truly
a palace of the sun

The advisors all applaud furiously but from the crowd there
is almost no reaction at all the triple ranks of soldiers
surrounding the square discourage any protest and as the
King leaves the platform the crowd begins to melt away

NEAR THE PLATFORM
Aramis watching the crowd disperse hears behind him --

VOICE
Aramis

Aramis turns to see the King who moves up alone

ARAMIS
Your Majesty

LOUIS
How goes that favor I asked of you

ARAMIS
I grow closer to my target your
Majesty

LOUIS

You bring me the heart of the Jesuit
General and you will have a palace
of your own

The King moves away followed by his fawning advisors
INT THE FAVORITE MISTRESS PALACE ROOMS - DAY
A young Musketeer ushers Michelle into the palace bedroom

previously occupied by the Kings last mistress The
Musketeer leaves her alone frozen in the center of the room
awed by the opulence Her eyes play over the details

-- The handcarved richly upholstered furniture beneath her
fingertips

-- The carved figures of cherubic angels gleaming with gold
upon the posts of the bed

-- The murals on the walls and ceiling

Her reverie is interrupted by a HANDMAIDEN who bustles in
carrying a magnificent dress

HANDMATDEN
After your bath put on this it is
the Kings favorite color That
letter on the desk came here for you
this morning

She tosses the dress onto the bed and is gone Left alone
Michelle lifts the letter and recognizes the writing

MICHELLE
Raoul

She opens the letter and reads quickly
MICHELLE

The army Oh Raoul dont despair
I will always be faithful

She interrupts herself as her eyes fall on the gorgeous
dress She looks around at the sumptuous palace apartment
and gazes again at the murals painted above the bed

They depict naked gods and goddesses in Olympian orgies

CUT TO

CLOSE - STEAMING WATER POURED INTO A TUB

The Handmaiden has prepared a 17th Century bathtub for
Michelle and now retires

HANDMATDEN
If you need me further just ring

As the handmaiden leaves exiting frame we PUSH IN on one of
the murals on the wall The eye of one of the figures there
is no longer the painted eye it was before but is a real
human eye disguised by the mural

THE KING IN THE SECRET PASSAGEWAY

is spying on Michelle

THE KINGS POV

as Michelle undresses and steps into the bath Louis catches
tantalizing glimpses of her richly sensual body in the soapy
water and it stokes his desire

INT PALACE - MICHELLES NEW ROOM —- DAY

Michelle stands before the mirror staring at herself
breaktakingly gorgeous in her new dress She stares for a

long time surprised at her own beauty

She reaches to a vase of roses and pulls one out blotting it
around her neck perfuming herself with its fragrance She

looks into the mirror at her eyes In guilt for what she
is already feeling she lifts Raouls letter to read it
again Then she gasps -- the King stands right before her
MICHELLE
Sire I -- How did you --
LOUIS

How did I get in Youre new here
and will soon learn many secrets
What is that

MICHELLE
Nothing

LOUIS
A letter May I see

He takes the letter she has no resistance against him The
King reads his eyes hardening suddenly but then he smiles

LOUIS
From Raoul He urges you to guard
your honor -- as if it could be in
any danger from your king
MICHELLE

Raoul is in love
LOUIS
Enough of this our dinner waits

Tossing the letter aside he offers her his arm She takes
it and allows him to escort her from the room

INT PALACE - THE HALL OF MIRRORS

The hall is alive with glorious light fiery gold frames
surrounding silvery mirrors blazing with reflections
Musicians line the length of the hall and when Louis and
Michelle appear at the far doorway they begin playing for the
couple as they parade past Michelle is speechless as Louis
smiles at her awed innocence

INT ROYAL DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Louis leads Michelle into a towering room surrounding a
magnificent table decked out with candelabra and sumptuous
delicacies -- set for just two

THE DINNER

Louis and Michelle sit opposite each other attended by a
dozen servants Michelle stares at her plate

LOUIS
The food doesnt please you

MICHELLE
Its lovely Its just

LOUIS
This is more than you are used to
Your mother is a seamstress your
father is dead You have three
younger sisters two of whom suffer
from consumption Dont look so
surprised Kings know such things

MICHELLE
I we are humble people

LOUIS
Wait no Do not be ashamed The
straits of your family need not be
permanent It is a simple matter to
have them brought to one of my
country estates where they may have
fine meals and physicians to look
after them

MICHELLE
You would do that your Majesty

LOUIS
My dear Ive already done it

She rushes to him and throws herself at his knees weeping in
gratitude Louis smiles as if embarrassed

LOUIS
Please darling that isnt
necessary We are friends now
Mademoiselle needs wine

A servant quickly approaches with wine the goblet at
Michelles place is quite large and he pours it full

INT MICHELLES BEDROOM - NIGHT
Louis leads Michelle back to her room shes a bit unsteady

from the wine but she grows alert as she notices him closing
the door behind her He stares into her eyes

LOUIS
You are beautiful You know you
are

MICHELLE
Sire I --

LOUIS

If you dont want to be so
appealing why did you touch the
rose to your skin Where was it
Here

He touches his lips to her throat She gasps but then pulls
away She glances at the letter on the writing table

LOUIS
What is it Raoul If he really
loved you he would have proposed
marriage He didnt did he

He sees her hesitation and uncertainty Hes smooth gentle
LOUIS
You have never known love until you
have known the love of a king

He kisses her for a moment she seems frozen and then she
yields Never having doubted that she would Louis pulls
the gown from her shoulders She doesnt resist

INT THE FORTRESS PRISON

The old Jailer carrying a torch that barely pushes back the
darkness leads another guard up the winding stairs

JAILER
Its a jolt at first so brace
yourself

INT CELL OF THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK

The Man in the Iron Mask lifts his head as a key rattles into
his door The door opens admitting his old Jailer anda
NEW KEEPER The New Keeper is just a younger version of the
old one -- greasy fat and cruel

NEW KEEPER
Ugh He looks orrible

The Man in the Iron Mask rises and takes a step forward the
new keeper recoils and raises his club threateningly

NEW KEEPER
Stay back

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
I frighten you Its okay Keeper
was scared of me too at first

NEW KEEPER
Scared

The New Keeper steps forward and clubs the Man in the Iron
Mask in the shoulder then kicks him as he falls

NEW KEEPER
Scared of you Not me Ill kill

him if he gets near me

The New Keeper strides out The Man in the Iron Mask pulls
himself to his knees his eyes visible through the slits of
the mask look sadly at the old Jailer

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
I miss Keeper I miss him so much

JAILER
Moron

The jailer leaves the cell locking the door behind him
INT A BATTLEFIELD COMMAND TENT

Raoul has just received orders from General Fromberge who
sits at a map table Raoul salutes and follows a young staff
officer from the tent As Raoul leaves the General
withdraws from his leather field pouch a royal letter --
parchment with blue and gold seals Fromberge touches the
edge of the parchment to the candle and burns the letter

EXT TRENCH - DARKNESS

Two men move along a deep trench the siege works of 17th
century siege warfare One of the men is Raoul carrying a
musket in his new uniform he looks out of place among the
dirty battle weary men they pass He is following the STAFF
OFFICER who is no older than himself but whose eyes are
already dead while Raouls are wide and wild

The trench is deep as a grave by crouching both men keep
their heads below the surrounding ground Thick smoke rolls
over their heads we cant tell if it is day or night From
all around come sounds of battle with the sporadic fire of
muskets and the rumble of cannons officers shout orders in
the distance wounded men nearby whimper for water and the
officer leads Raoul by them as if they did not exist

H

he young Staff Officer stops at a bend in the trench

STAFF OFFICER
Here

Without another word he goes back the way he came Raoul
grips his musket and looks around him he finds himself among
several dozen stark eyed men manning the forward curve of the
trench He has little time to wonder what will happen next
A horn trumpets close by and with a shout the French
soldiers clamber out of their breastworks

For an instant Raoul hesitates in pure terror then joins
the charge with a shout of his own --

RAOUL
Mi-cheeelllll --

On the stone wall looming above the French soldiers orange
blossoms of fire -- the muzzle flash of primitive cannons --
penetrate the smoke and the ground at Raouls feet explodes
hurling him backwards He covered barely a few feet and
falls almost exactly where he started
Dead

CUT TO
CLOSE - THE DOOR OF ATHOS ROOMS - DAY
A gloved hand raps on the door Athos opens it to a military
messenger who shoves at him a single sheet of paper rolled
and tied with ribbon
INT ATHOS ROOM - NIGHT

The message slams onto the table as Athos staggers upon it
his legs buckling beneath him in shock and grief

INT DARTAGNANS ROOM - DAY
DArtagnan is working at his desk as the Lieutenant enters

LIEUTENANT
Sir a casualty report came

DArtagnan looks at the paper the Lieutenant hands him

DARTAGNAN
No no no

He sags for a moment then grabs his cloak and sword

INT EXT MUSKETEERS GATE OF THE PALACE - DAY

The Musketeers Gate is close to the stables where the
Musketeers train and keep their horses DArtagnan hurries

from the Palace and snaps an order

DARTAGNAN
Saddle my horse
The grooms jump to work several young Musketeers nearby stop
their training noticing their Captains agitation

DARTAGNAN
Hurry --

But then dArtagnan sees Athos coming riding furiously
through the Musketeers gate DArtagnan steps out to meet
him as Athos reins in his horse and jumps from the saddle

DARTAGNAN
Athos my friend --

Athos marches to the palace door dArtagnan cuts him off

DARTAGNAN
Athos please

ATHOS
Get out of my way

DARTAGNAN
(grabbing him)
Athos I beg you --

Athos punches dArtagnan with furious strength knocking him
aside The young Musketeers reach for their weapons but
dArtagnan is up quickly throwing himself in front of Athos
again blocking the doorway into the palace

DARTAGNAN
Where are you going

ATHOS
To kill the king

At this the swords of the young Musketeers sing from their
scabbards Athos wears a sword but he has not drawn it

DARTAGNAN
Athos I know life means nothing to
you at this moment but I will not
let you kill yourself

ATHOS
The King killed my son

DARTAGNAN
The cannons killed Raoul The
cannons and love But not the King

A YOUNG MUSKETEER steps up

YOUNG MUSKETEER
Ill kill the old man for you
Captain if you dont wish to --

Athos spins striking like a rattlesnake his sword whipping
from its scabbard and slicing off the arrogant young
Musketeers ear He flicks anothers sword from his grasp
then brings the the point of his own blade up beneath the
chin of a third shoving him back

ATHOS
Come on All of you

DArtagnan tackles Athos from behind and pins him face down
to the hay For a moment Athos bellows in rage --

ATHOS
Coward Fight me Fight me

Emotion spills up into Athos throat and he begins to sob
ATHOS
He killed my son dArtagnan He

killed my son

DArtagnan dying inside still grips Athos Athos grows
quiet and the young Musketeers drift closer

DARTAGNAN
Get back all of you

DArtagnan stands and Athos rises still holding his sword
He looks at dArtagnan a long beat then sheathes his sword

and turns to his horse The young soldiers move to him

DARTAGNAN
Let him go

Athos mounts his horse and with a last glance back at
dArtagnan he gallops away

INT KINGS BEDCHAMBER - DAY

The King has just climaxed in his lovemaking and lies spent
upon Michelle His rest is interrupted by a KNOCK at his
door The King scowls

LOUIS
What
VOICE
Your Majesty it is Andre

Louis groans and pulls on a robe Michelle whispers --

MICHELLE
Shall I leave

LOUIS
No you may wait behind the screen

Michelle rises and slips behind a painted dressing screen as
Louis goes to the door and admits the young Lieutenant

BEHIND THE SCREEN Michelle lifts a jeweled hand mirror and
appraises her face she begins brushing her long hair She
can hear the conversation

LIEUTENANT
I would not have disturbed you
Majesty but you ordered me to keep
you informed --

LOUIS
Yes yes go on

LIEUTENANT
Athos the former Musketeer has
just fought with several of your
guard at the Musketeers Gate

Behind the screen Michelle pauses at the mention of Athos

LOUIS
Did they kill him

LIEUTENANT
No He cut an ear from one of the
men no one else was hurt Captain

dArtagnan allowed him to leave
Athos was upset about the death of
his son at the front
CRASH From behind the screen comes the sound of the mirror
shattering as it drops to the floor It startles the
Lieutenant but the King goes on

LOUIS
Who was Athos seeking Tell me
Did he try to enter the palace

LIEUTENANT
He did -- but Captain dArtagnan
blocked his way

LOUIS
You may go Lieutenant

The Lieutenant moves back to the door

LIEUTENANT
Do you want Athos arrested your
Majesty

LOUIS
Not by you I will order dArtagnan
to do it

The Lieutenant leaves and Louis moves behind the screen to
see Michelle stagger and grip the dressing table her bare
feet step onto the broken glass of the mirror yet she is
oblivious to the cuts Louis sees this and grabs her

LOUIS
My dear The glass --

He pulls her to the couch and draws a blanket about her
cuddling her as she begins to shake

MICHELLE
Did you know about Raoul

LOUIS
I did not want to upset you It was
tragic I did everything I could
for him I ordered him positioned
in a spot of complete safety far
from the fighting But he
disregarded my wishes and charged
into danger

He cuddles her as she weeps
LOUIS
I will order a Mass for his soul
It will guarantee his place in
Heaven

MICHELLE
Oh Louis Louis

She clings to him in her grief
EXT NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL - DAY

The great cathedral rises next to the monastery where Aramis
resides We PAN DOWN and PUSH IN on the cobblestones between
the two structures as if penetrating to --

SUBTERRANEAN PASSAGES
Aramis leads Porthos through tunnels twisting descending

PORTHOS
Aramis is this the way to hell

ARAMIS
Hell may be our destination dear
Porthos but not this trip

They reach an iron door and move through it into
A GORGEOUS SECRET CHAPEL

Candles illuminate masterpiece frescoes The place is
breathtaking

PORTHOS
Where are we

ARAMIS
Jesus of Nazareth found the holy
among the profane If we are to
have a place of private prayer
where better than here beside the
channels where the shit and the
garbage run to the river

Porthos notices niches in the walls he looks closely and
sees the face of a corpse enclosed behind glass
PORTHOS
Mother of God

ARAMIS
It is also a place of burial

PORTHOS
A tomb Were in a tomb

ARAMIS
Catacombs Very holy

Porthos looks as if the bodies could resurrect at any moment
-- then jumps out of his skin as the door opens

PORTHOS
Yaaaahhh

A hooded figure looking like the Grim Reaper enters

ARAMIS
Relax you big fool its
dArtagnan

And sure enough the hooded figure whom we now see has been
led in by a little monk is dArtagnan Aramis nods to the
monk who leaves quickly Before dArtagnan can ask
anything Porthos jumps again the back door has opened and
monks usher in Athos who freezes as he sees dArtagnan

ARAMIS
Its all right DArtagnan was the
one who warned us that hed been
given an order for your arrest
Here you have sanctuary -- does he
not dArtagnan

The escort monks disappear closing the chapel door so that
the four Musketeers are left to sit at a small table the
monks have set up Athos and DArtagnan opposite each other

ARAMIS
Look at us We are old men now But
once we were young And when we saw
injustice we fought it

DARTAGNAN
We have grown wiser with age Now
we know that some problems cannot be
settled with a sword

ATHOS

And some problems
without one

cannot be settled

ARAMIS

Well here is the
the King has
the identity

of Jesuits

of t

and kill him

problem at hand

ordered me to discover

he Governor General
As our

English rivals have left the

Catholic Church

Louis has struck on

a plan to dominate the whole of

Europe by uniting
and making himsel

Church and State

f head of both He

has already picked the Pope
the Jesuits who put God above
throne or papacy stand in his way

Only

PORTHOS
But -- doesnt God ordain both Pope
and King

ARAMIS

So they tell us But what are we to
believe when the king is a tyrant
and the Church meant to stand for
all those oppressed has become the
tool of oppression When no

conscience is tolerated No
dissent no objection

PORTHOS
It is a weighty problem Aramis --

but perhaps you should leave it to
this secret General of the Jesuits
whoever he might be

ARAMIS
Easy to say but hard to do For
what I am trying to tell you is that
I am the Governor General of Jesuits
in France

A stunned silence

ATHOS
What do you propose to do
ARAMIS
Replace the king

DARTAGNAN
I cannot hear this

PORTHOS
It cant be done

ARAMIS
It can I know the way

ATHOS
I am with you

DARTAGNAN
No Stop --

ARAMIS
I will need you all All for one
One for all

DARTAGNAN
(jumping up)
You -- You cannot ask me to betray
my king I have sworn to him

ATHOS
It is honor you serve and when the
king is dishonorable you are removed
from your oath of honor

DARTAGNAN
An oath is an oath precisely because
it cannot be removed

ATHOS
Why do you follow him dArtagnan
I know you have put service above
your own life but why does this
King deserve such loyalty He is a
monster He executes ministers for
his own blunders with their
families hostage so they take the
blame He has no honor

DARTAGNAN
No man is all bad or all good I
believe -- I must believe -- that
Louis can learn And perhaps I can
help him

Athos leaps up from the table and glares at dArtagnan

ATHOS
Whatever the plan I am in it
The next time we meet one of us

will die
He storms out of the rear door of the chapel

ARAMIS
Porthos see to Athos wont you

Porthos follows Athos Aramis and dArtagnan are left alone

ARAMIS
I have heard many confessions
dArtagnan But even if I were not
a priest I could tell your heart
has a secret weight and it is
hurting you to carry it alone

DARTAGNAN
The secret I carry I cannot share
Not even with God
DArtagnan moves to the door
DARTAGNAN
I cannot betray Louis I will

defend him with my life

ARAMIS
I know God go with you

DArtagnan leaves Aramis alone in the secret chapel
EXT THE MONASTERY - NIGHT
Aramis leads Athos and Porthos out of the catacombs

ARAMIS
This way

They move into a moonlit courtyard of the monastery A
hooded Jesuit standing guard steps from the shadows then
recognizes Aramis and admits the trio to the monasterys
forge where more hooded Jesuits are working in secret
heating iron red hot in the bellows furnace

ATHOS
What are they doing

ARAMIS
Making the key to the throne

PORTHOS
They are very large keys

One of the blacksmiths uses tongs to remove something red
from the fire he hammers it in a shower of sparks and
plunges it into water Aramis pulls the result from the
water and shows it to Athos and Porthos

It is an iron mask

EXT A CARRIAGE - FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

The carriage rolls through the long sweep of the French
countryside traveling fast

INT THE CARRIAGE - NIGHT

The three Musketeers -- Aramis Athos and Porthos -- have
been traveling for some time Porthos is asleep snoring

ATHOS
Porthos sleeps and you plot Dont
you think its time you told me what
it is you are plotting

ARAMIS
Soon enough Here we are

Kicking Porthos feet to wake him Aramis opens the carriage
door and they step out

EXT FRENCH COAST - NIGHT

Lying just off the coast is the forbidden island where the
imposing fortress prison rises on the promontory off shore

ATHOS
The Prison of Belle Sur
ARAMIS
Come we have a boat waiting

As hooded Jesuits appear from the shadows to guide them
Athos and Porthos glance at each other Porthos shrugs

EXT AMONG ROCKS AT THE BEACH - NIGHT

The guides lead the Musketeers down a hilly path to a long
boat hidden among the large rocks that dot the coast
Sitting next to the boat is a scrawny little man in priests
garb at his feet is a long narrow bundle about the size of
a mummy with a rope tied at either end

The guides drag the boat across the sand into the surf
Aramis throws off his cape and strips down almost naked
Hes still fit and hard With the guides helping him he
lifts the bundle by its ropes and ties it around his waist

ATHOS
What is that

ARAMIS
A body

ATHOS
I see that is a body But where did
you get it

Aramis ignores the question and the guides dress him in
priests garb With the robes spreading over the big bundle
added artfully to Aramis waist it appears he is a very fat
priest the wig and false beard the assistants give him adds
to the illusion of Aramis as a wild reclusive monk

The sun is beginning to come up over the mountains
PORTHOS
He gets one day of confession each

year Today is the day

ATHOS
Who does

PORTHOS
Best not to ask Shouldnt even

talk about it

Aramis steps onto the boat The little priest who first
joined them gets in too along with a couple of rowers

ATHOS
What do we do now

PORTHOS
I dont know about you but I plan
to wait here

The rowers pull the boat toward the fortress prison
INT FORTRESS PRISON - DAY

The pink light of the new day barely penetrates the gloom of
the prison The boat carrying Aramis and the little priest
reaches the gate of the prison which reaches to the water
line As Aramis steps out GUARDS meet them

HEAD GUARD
Who is this then

The little priest remains in the boat slumped over One
GUARD speaks to the little priest in Italian and the little
priest seems barely able to left his head Aramis answers for
him in Italian and the guard translates --

GUARD
He says hes the replacement

Aramis rattles off more Italian

GUARD
He says it is only one day a month
when the prisoner gets confession
and the little one is too sick to
move The big one doesnt speak
French either

HEAD GUARD
Then lets get it done

The head guard gestures to let them pass
INT CELL OF THE MAN IN THE IRON MASK
The prisoner has used the torn Bible to make all sorts of

amazing origami invented from his own head He looks up as
he hears the door open and sees Aramis the priest
MAN IN THE IRON MASK
My confession day But where is the
other one

Aramis says something in Latin -- the first words of the
ceremony of absolution -- as the guards lock the door behind
him and move off down the corridor

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
I know you dont speak my language
-- but is the other one all right
Please tell me he is not dead too
or I will have lost everyone

Aramis goes on mumbling Latin mechanically for the sake of
the retreating guards The Man in the Iron Mask is desperate
for someone to talk to

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
I tore my Bible Or someone else
did But it was all right Let the
words of my mouth and the
meditations of my heart be
acceptable in Thy sight Oh Lord our
God and My Redeemer

Aramis has stopped talking and stares transfixed at this
sight of the prisoner in the iron mask

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
Im sorry Youre never seen me
before I must frighten you

Aramis puts his finger to his lips

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
What are you doing Why do you --

Aramis clamps his hand over the mouth hole and whispers --

ARAMIS
I am a friend here to help you

Aramis hurriedly removes his robes revealing the bundle

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
What --

ARAMIS
It is an escape To freedom

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
Freedom

He says it as if the concept is beyond him Aramis undoes
the bundle revealing the limp body

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
Wh-- He is dead Who is he

ARAMIS
He is you

Aramis uncovers the head of the body It is covered in a
mask identical to the prisoners

INT PRISON CORRIDOR - CELL
The Guards are sharing a bottle of wine when they hear --

ARAMIS
Hey Hey

GUARD
What now

INT CELL

The guards enter to find the Man in the Iron Mask slumped on
the floor Aramis looking like the fat priest again stands
over him spouting Italian as one GUARD translates --

GUARD
He says he just fell stone dead as
he was reading him the Mass

HEAD GUARD
I never thought the bugger would
last this long But how could he
just keel over and --

Aramis rattles off more Italian and suddenly the guard who
understands it stops examining the body and backs off

GUARD
He says the prisoner has the fever
just like the little priest does
HEAD GUARD
Plague They brought plague in
here Get him out of here Now

Aramis rattles off a protest in Italian

GUARD
No no last rites Get away

EXT PRISON - DAY

Aramis climbs into the boat as he sits down his belly stirs
but the guards dont see it -- they are using poles to push
the boat away into the sea

EXT THE COASTLINE - DAY

Athos and Porthos stand as the boat reaches the shore and
tucks in among the rocks Sheltered from the view from the
prison Aramis steps from the boat and removes his robes

The prisoner dangles tied wrist and ankle from around
Aramis neck

ATHOS
My God

Athos Porthos and the others gawk at the sight of the Man

in the Iron Mask as Aramis loosens the ropes As they back
away from him he sees the sky Endless blue -- and bright
He shields his eyes

ARAMIS
Its all right Take your time

Aramis helps him up and turn him slowly around to face
The fortressprison in the distance
THE PRISONERS POV FROM WITHIN THE MASK A vast vista -- the

sky the sea and the prison on the island in the middle of
it all The prisoner falls to his knees and weeps

ARAMIS
Athos He needs a gentle hand

Athos moves over hesitantly and puts his hand on the
shoulder of the Man in the Iron Mask who holds his hands
against the mask as if to further hide his shame
INT THE PRISON - DAY

The guards are standing in the cell looking down at the body
now wearing the mask the man they think was their prisoner
The guards are quiet alone

GUARD 1
You ever wonder who he was

GUARD 2
No Yes But I never asked -- and
you better not either

They wrap the body still in its mask in a weighted sack
EXT PRISON - DAY

The prisons WARDEN GENERAL stands at the wall of the
fortress high above the sea and watches as his guards throw
off the body wrapped in canvas weighted with stones As the
corpse makes a long fall and crashes into the sea the Warden

writes a message on a royal scroll

THE UNSEEN PRISONER IS DEAD

The Warden seals the scroll and hands it to a messenger
EXT COUNTRY ESTATE - NIGHT

A carriage pulls into a country estate isolated among vast
woodlands silver in the moonlight Mysterious servants with
shielded lanterns converge on the carriage as it stops

INT CARRIAGE - NIGHT

Athos reaches for his sword but Aramis stops his hand

ARAMIS
Jesuits

EXT MANOR HOUSE COURTYARD - NIGHT
Aramis emerges quickly whispering directives to the Jesuits
Athos helps the Man in the Iron Mask from the carriage his

head shrouded by a cloak

Aramis has a blacksmith waiting almost before he realizes it
the Man in the Iron Mask finds his head placed on an anvil
but as the hammer rises he begins to scream

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
No Please

ARAMIS
What is wrong We only mean to free
you from the mask

But the prisoner is shaking and Athos understands why

ATHOS
Prison was horrible but it was his
home Hes been torn from it by
strangers Hes frightened
exhausted -- and the mask is
familiar Let him rest in it
tonight and remove it tomorrow

ARAMIS
Excellent Athos You have a keen
sense of this man

ATHOS
His plight is obvious isnt it

Athos angry with Aramis arrogance and insensitivity leads
the Man in the Iron Mask toward the house then Aramis spots
Porthos looking downcast

ARAMIS
And why are you so glum

PORTHOS
I expected action There was no

killing no fighting I was useless

In deep depression Porthos climbs out and shuffles off
Aramis sighs shakes his head and walks to the house

INT MANOR HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT

Athos helps the Man in the Iron Mask onto the bed the eyes
behind the slits in the mask are darting frightened

ATHOS
Are you hungry

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
Just water

Athos pours a cupful from the water pitcher on the bed table
but when he tries to help the prisoner drink the liquid
spills as the cup bumps the mouth hole

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
This way

The prisoner manipulates the cup in the way he must to get a
drink then falls back to the pillow

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
This place I once lived ina
country house I had guardians --
an old man and woman And tutors
But no friends Then when I was
twelve they came and took me to the
prison

ATHOS
Who came

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
A man in black I never saw his
face He took me to the cell A
blacksmith came and they put me into
the mask For days I shouted What
have I done Why do you do this to
me But no one heard so I just
stopped shouting

ATHOS
And you never knew why

las

RISONER

I thought there is something
about my face that men do not want
to see Something that makes them
cruel But then I realized they
were cruel even when I was wearing
the mask I knew there must be some
other reason but I could not think
what it was

ATHOS
What is your name

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
The old man and woman called me
Phillippe

ATHOS
Phillippe Rest now

Athos moves to the door

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
Thank you for your kindness

Athos nods pauses a moment and leaves
INT A DARK APARTMENT IN PARIS - NIGHT

The lock rattles and the door swings open DArtagnan
enters lifting a lantern to throw light on the dark room
It is Athos apartment the one he visited earlier now he
finds it empty devoid of clues He stands there alone

He turns to leave then glimpses a familiar painting hanging
beside the door Lifting his light he studies the portrait
Athos Aramis Porthos and himself -- four Musketeers beat
friends in their prime Together then inseparable

DARTAGNAN
My friends Where have you gone

He lowers the lantern and leaves
CUT TO
THE MESSAGE FROM THE PRISON

INT PALACE - KINGS STUDY - DAY

The King reads the message rerolls it thinks a moment and
hands the scroll to Claude

LOUIS
Take this to my mother

THE MESSAGE

is again passed this time into the hands of the Queen
Mothers eldest nun-attendant and then into the hands of the
Queen Mother herself The Queen is in her private rooms and
for the first time we see her with her hair down She
accepts the scroll opens it and reads

Her eyes fill with pain grief guilt emotions she hides

INT DARTAGNANS ROOM - NIGHT

DArtagnan returns from his ride to Athos place He looks
down at the Queens door He checks the clock on the wall
it is a few minutes past nine He enters his room moves to
the window and waits there to catch a glimpse of her

INT COUNTRY MANOR HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - NIGHT

Aramis is digging into a hearty meal while Porthos only
stares at his plate

ARAMIS
See There is plenty of food in the
country But the King keeps it
going to the army instead of --

Athos marches in all business

ATHOS
He is sleeping Now see here
Aramis its time you told us --

He breaks off as a voluptuous serving girl leans over to
spoon food onto Porthos plate her breasts jiggle below his
nose and she gives him a smile

PORTHOS
I have no appetite for food I am
wasting away Say goodbye to
Porthos for he is gone Even women
dont interest me now

The girl moves to whisper with two other serving girls who
seem fascinated with the roguish Porthos their giggles and
winks make Porthos even more morose he tells his friends
PORTHOS
I tell you a secret I sleep with
three women at once not because my
appetite is so great but because
now it take three to excite me

Porthos heaves himself to his feet and shuffles off Aramis
sighs having heard all this before Athos sits down

ATHOS
Who is he Aramis

ARAMIS
Tomorrow

ATHOS
Tonight Right now We steal a man
from a royal prison we hide ina
country chateau among an assortment
of saints and sluts such as only you
could provide and still you wish to
tell me nothing

ARAMIS
You seek facts when it would be
better to seek truth

ATHOS
You are not my priest Aramis You
would not be even if I had one

ARAMIS
You are bitter Athos You are torn
by grief not only for Raoul but
for dArtagnan whom you love and
now treat as an enemy

ATHOS
He who is not with us is against us

ARAMIS
Those are the words of a broken
spirit My spirit is whole I have
trusted dArtagnan with my deepest
secrets and I will never believe
he is my enemy

ATHOS
Then you are a fool -- a fool who
has never lost a son What gives
you the right to judge me to play
God with the lives of others Is it
because you are so much holier than
everyone else

ARAMIS
There is that of course -- but
mainly it is because I am so much
smarter than everyone else

They are interrupted by Porthos bloodcurdling SCREAM

ARAMIS
Porthos

He draws his sword and runs for the outside
EXT MANOR HOUSE - NIGHT

Aramis and Athos rush through the courtyard surrounded by
moonlight and trees confused about where Porthos is Then
they hear bellowing SCREAM OF PAIN from the latrine

Swords drawn they bang into the latrine to find Porthos
just finishing urinating

PORTHOS
Kidney rocks It hurts when I pee
It hurts when I shit Im just a
fat old fart with nothing to live
for any more Im going to hang
myself as soon as Im sober

They watch him shuffle toward the main house

INT THE PALACE - THE QUEEN MOTHERS ROOM - NIGHT

she bolts from her room through the outer room where her

attendants sit and into the corridor

The eldest nun follows her
EXT PALACE GARDEN - NIGHT

Anne rushes through the evening toward her little chapel in
the palace garden she is a tragic romantic sight her long
hair flying behind her as she runs

IN HIS ROOM DARTAGNAN

has been standing at his window for his nightly glimpse of
Anne Now he sees her not with her retinue of nuns but
running to her chapel clearly distraught

INT EXT PALACE GARDEN - GARDEN CHAPEL - NIGHT

Anne reaches the door and finds a few nuns and an old priest
praying in the little chapel She staggers forward to the
altar and falls to her knees there The nuns and the old
priest seeing the Queen Mother so distraught stand silently
and file out leaving her in solitude

ANNE
Oh God I -- Forgive me

DARTAGNAN
Mlady

She whirls to see him the sight of her face bursting with
emotions she has kept buried draws him nearer

DARTAGNAN
What --

ANNE
No stay back Stay back

He freezes in his tracks she holds her hands out toward him
as if warding off a blow Hes desperate to move to her she
sees it on his face

ANNE
DArtagnan

Her emotions break all her resolve to keep him away she
rushes into his arms They clutch each other in an embrace
they have denied for many years They kiss hungrily

DARTAGNAN
Mlady if anyone sees it is
death
ANNE
If I dont kiss you I die anyway

DARTAGNAN
I cant bear to see you cry What
is wrong

ANNE
Nothing Nothing

She draws back he tries to hold her But the thoughts of
answering that question makes her stiffen

ANNE

Nothing This didnt happen I

procession she walking ahead he trailing like a proper
commoner several feet behind
INT PALACE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

open the door for her and she keeps her eyes lowered But
before he can let her go he must whisper

DARTAGNAN
Anne I know I know that to
love you is treason against France
But not to love you is treason

against my heart
ANNE
Then we will both die traitors

dArtagnan

With those whispered words hanging in the air she enters her
room And dArtagnan moves alone back to his

INT MICHELLES BEDROOM - NIGHT

The King is trying to make love with Michelle -- but she
isnt responding He stops exasperated

She says nothing He tries kissing her again

LOUIS
What is wrong

She begins weeping uncontrollably and turns from him

MICHELLE
Raoul Oh Raoul

LOUIS
Listen my darling Raoul was
a a good friend And now he is

dead and that is very sad but --

MICHELLE
Well burn in hell Both of us

The King stands hes had enough of this

LOUIS
No my love You will burn in hell
for your sins But I will not --
for I am King My position is
ordained by God

He snatches the gold coverlet from her bed to cover his naked
body and stalks to his stairway the embroidered coverlet
trails behind him like a regal train in a royal procession
Leaving her weeping he moves down into

INT THE KINGS BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

The King angrily stalks around his bedroom too agitated to
sleep He grabs food from the table by the window and
starts to pop a grape into his mouth when he stops He sees
something out the window it stops him dead cold

It is a man standing in the gardens wearing an iron mask

EXT GARDENS - OUTSIDE THE KINGS WINDOW - NIGHT
The apparition ducks into the shadows
INT PALACE - DARTAGNANS ROOM - NIGHT

DArtagnan is sitting on his cot thinking of all that has
just happened when he hears the kings shouts of alarm

LOUIS VOICE
Help

In an instant dArtagnan is reacting snatching up his sword
and racing out into the corridor toward the Kings room

INT CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The guards outside the Kings room find the door latched from
within and they dont know what to do DArtagnan running
up never slows down he crashes into the doors

INT THE KINGS BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

The King whirls as the doors explode inward and dArtagnan
barrels through

LOUIS
Out there Look Out there He --

The garden is empty

DARTAGNAN
I just left the garden it was
empty What did you see

LOUIS
It was nothing A nightmare
nothing more Go away I --

DArtagnan guides his guards out but glances back to see the
King ashamed and worried DArtagnan tells his men --

DARTAGNAN
Check the garden

EXT GARDEN - OUTSIDE THE KINGS WINDOW - NIGHT

An old Jesuit priest slips back into the garden chapel where
the nuns have returned to pray He kneels at a back pew
tucking the iron mask deep within his robes The young
Musketeers who move through the garden glance into the
chapel see only the normal piety and move on The old
priest crosses himself bows his head and smiles

CUT TO
CLOSE - PHILLIPPES EYES THROUGH THE SLITS OF THE MASK

They are frightened As we PULL BACK we see the Iron Mask
in an OVERHEAD POV Phillippe is lying on his back his
head resting on an anvil Athos stands close by lending
support Aramis and Porthos look on A blacksmith stands
over Phillippe He positions the point of his chisel against
the lock of the mask It takes several ringing hammer blows
-- which we experience from a POV WITHIN THE MASK -- before
the lock breaks

Athos as gently as he can pries open the iron mask
PHILLIPPES FACE

is a wretched sight overgrown with a matted tangle of hair
and beard and with a deathly pallor

Phillippe sits up lifting his head out of the mask He
looks at the Musketeers watching them for their reactions
At first they are frozen then there is recognition awe

Phillippe sees a cooling bucket beside the forge and looks
down into THE SURFACE OF THE WATER at his REFLECTION

PORTHOS
Aramis Athos He looks exactly
like exactly like

ARAMIS

I will answer all your questions
But first soap water and a razor

INT THE MANOR HOUSES MAIN DINING ROOM - DAY

Aramis and Porthos are sitting at the table when Athos ushers
in --

PHILLIPPE CLEANED UP
The change in him is remarkable and his face so identical to

the Kings that Porthos actually jumps Phillippe takes a
seat opposite Aramis and looks around wary vulnerable
ARAMIS
Yes Identical

Aramis eyes are aflame as he looks across at Phillippe

ARAMIS
The greatest secret of life is who
we truly are Now I must give you
that secret which has been kept
from you your whole life It began
on the night when Louis was born

PORTHOS
I remember that night DArtagnan
was drunk the only time Ive seen
him that way The three of us were
reveling remember Athos

ARAMIS
But I was on duty

IN FLASHBACK

We see the shadowy Musketeer we saw in the opening moving up
the dark steps of the palace We see now it was Aramis

ARAMIS VOICE
I was summoned to the royal
apartments Arrange a carriage
they told me and wait by the door
of the stables

INTERCUT FLASHBACK
We see images of that night as we saw in the opening

ARAMIS VOICE

They brought a baby from the back of
the palace into the black carriage
I had waiting They had given the
driver instructions about where it
was and I was ordered to make the
whole journey with the blinds of the
carriage drawn

In the flashback we see the young Musketeer Aramis his face
shielded in shadow handing a living bundle over to someone
at one of the back doors of a large country house

ARAMIS VOICE
I carried that baby into the
countryside to a chateau like this
one And there I left him

ARAMIS IN THE PRESENT

ARAMIS
I have never forgotten that night
or what I carried

PORTHOS
I dont understand What does this
have to do with You carried a
baby somewhere its unusual but --

ARAMIS
Not just a baby Porthos I carried
the child of the king

PORTHOS
The child of the king is the
king Louis

ARAMIS
No not Louis

PORTHOS
Athos do you understand this He
confuses me --

ARAMIS
I carried the kings child The
queen had twins that night and one
of them was sent away in secret

PORTHOS
But why

ARAMIS
Because the old king had a twin as
well and through his whole reign
his brother fought him for the
throne Then he had two heirs not
just sons but twins So he decided
that one be put away as if he never
existed You Phillippe

Phillippe is pale We DISSOLVE TO a flashback of
Phillippes early education in the country house

ARAMIS VOICE
The old king ordered you be educated
and well treated but your identity
kept from you and all those around
you

The FLASHBACK moves to the palace matching the narration --

ARAMIS VOICE
On his death bed he revealed your
existence to Louis and your mother
Your mother had been told by her own
priest that you had died at birth
Somehow she blamed herself for ever
believing it and she wished to
restore your birthright But now
Louis was king

We see in FLASHBACK Louis wearing his new crown plotting

ARAMIS VOICE
A priest even a Pope he could kill
without hesitation but he was
afraid to kill you for his whole
claim to power rests on the sanctity
of royal blood So he had you
hidden in a way that only a monster
could devise I know for it was I
who took you to prison and the Iron
Mask Someday I will ask your
forgiveness But not until we have
restored to you what is yours

We are in present time again All eyes are on Phillippe

PHILLIPPE
Restored

ARAMIS
We will replace Louis with
Phillippe No one but the King
himself -- and now we -- knows
Phillippe even exists All we have
to do is switch them

ATHOS
Switch That is your plan It is
ludicrous

ARAMIS
I have it all worked out

ATHOS
Physical resemblance is but one
small thing Louis has an
arrogance a manner --

ARAMIS
Those can be adopted --

ATHOS
And people close to him who --

ARAMIS
Do you think I have not considered
that I have a plan -- and you may

rest assured that it is brilliant

ATHOS
It is not just our lives you risk
with this conceit of yours It is

Phillippes as well

ARAMIS
Yes and he has a choice

Aramis stops thundering at Athos and turns to Phillippe

ARAMIS
What about it Phillippe All that
time in prison all that time you
suffered was it for nothing You
memorized the entire Bible or so
your priest told me An act of
survival of defiance of courage
Your years within the mask have
given you reserves of strength that
others could not imagine Your home
was a dungeon and now you may be a
king if you have the heart to make
it so Do you have the heart

Phillippe stands shakily and faces them

PHILLIPPE
I will try
Phillippe walks -- nearly wanders -- from the room

ARAMIS
You see A king

Athos with a glare at Aramis follows Phillippe
EXT MANOR HOUSE GARDENS - DAY

The gardens are sun drenched bursting with the beauty of a
French summer Athos finds Phillippe there sitting alone

ATHOS
Recent hours have been a shock

PHILLIPPE
Perhaps not as much as you might
imagine When tutors answered every
question except those about who I
was When I was imprisoned in a way
no other man had ever been I knew
there was something different about
me But a king

ATHOS
Phillippe there is something I
hope you understand Terrible
cruelty has been used against you
And you must understand that you
did nothing to deserve it

PHILLIPPE
here is wrath in me I have
earned to hide it Those years in
he cell I dreamed that freedom
ould someday just happen the way
he mask happened Now I am free
nd with each free breath I feel the
rowing desire to make someone
uffer for all I lost Look at
his all this that for ten years I
could not see What if I become a
king -- a king no different from my
brother

tTHQPtEtHH

ATHOS
The desire for vengeance can be a
poison
PHILLIPPE
What is its antidote

ATHOS
I suppose it is to remember there
are many people who have never been
in a prison who pass such beauty
every day and never see it

Phillippe reaches to a flower plucks it and smells it He
looks around at the beauty of the garden taking it all in

Athos looks around too then Athos realizes Phillippe is no

longer looking at the garden but at him

PHILLIPPE
You look so sad Is it something I
have done

ATHOS
It is something I have done -- or
did not do

PHILLIPPE
What is that

ATHOS
I did not share beauty with

someone who is no longer here for
me to share beauty with

Before Phillippe can pursue this Athos turns businesslike

ATHOS
We have much to do wed best get
started Now suppose you were to
walk into a garden as a king
INT MANOR HOUSE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Aramis is having dinner he calls toward the kitchen

ARAMIS

Athos enters and sags into a chair his energy spent

ARAMIS
How is he
EXT

ATHOS
Resting hes had a long day
Aramis --

ARAMIS
(calling out)
More wine

ATHOS
You must reconsider this plan
Phillippe is like a child he --

ARAMIS
You can do it

ATHOS
In a year maybe two I could teach
him enough to --

ARAMIS
Three days

ATHOS
Three days

ARAMIS

The King is having a ball a
masquerade ball It is the perfect
opportunity and perhaps our only
one At any time Phillippe could be
discovered and what then Remember
France Remember the poor

Remember Raoul More wine Where
are those serving girls

CHATEAU - NIGHT

As Aramis and Athos are downstairs arguing
window of a candlelit bedroom

INT

We PAN from the window to the bed

CHATEAU BEDROOM - NIGHT

we PAN UP to the

where Porthos is making

love -- or trying to We see his huge bare broad back

blotting out all view of his partner

He grunts then roles

over in despair -- revealing not one but three serving girls

lying beneath him

nearly smothered by Porthos bulk

jammed side-by-side like firewood all
PORTHOS
Its no use My sword is bent

SERVING WOMAN
Itll be all right Youre just
taking a while to get started

PORTHOS
No its dead I am useless

Porthos heaves himself out of bed

EXT CHATEAU - NIGHT

While Aramis and Athos are visible through the window
arguing and gesturing Porthos -- still naked -- walks across

the moonlit courtyard to the barn

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

ATHOS
Phillippe -- hes very bright hes
perceptive but he is in such
turmoil --

ARAMIS

You grow fond of him Thats good

ATHOS
Dont play God with me Aramis I --

Athos interrupts himself as he glimpses the naked Porthos
moving across the courtyard toward the barn

ARAMIS

Go on
ATHOS

But -- what is Porthos doing
ARAMIS

Going into the barn naked -- or so

it appears

We INTERCUT Porthos in the barn with Aramis and Athos in the
house

IN THE BARN
Porthos alone within the barn finds a thick plow rope and
fashions a noose

IN THE HOUSE

ARAMIS
Now You were saying

ATHOS
But -- what is he doing
ARAMIS
About to hang himself I should

think
IN THE BARN

Porthos throws one end of the rope over the central beam of
the barn and ties the other end off He shoves a milking
stool up below the noose climbs onto it and fits the noose
around his neck NOTE When we see him in full view it is
only from behind -- and this angle is a sight to behold

IN THE HOUSE
Aramis detachment only aggravates Athos excitement

ATHOS
Hang himself

ARAMIS
Hes threatened to do it its been
building up in him for months

ATHOS
We must stop him

ARAMIS
Come now Athos if Porthos is
determined to end his life then he
will certainly manage to find the

opportunity
ATHOS
But -- but --
Athos jumps up and makes for the door -- but Aramis hooded

helpers at a signal from Aramis bar his way
IN THE BARN
Porthos grave with drama utters his last words
PORTHOS

Adieu cruel life Farewell to

useless Porthos
He steps off the stool
His great weight drops The rope snaps taught The beam it
is tied to snaps like a twig -- right in the place where it

has been sawn nearly in half already

Porthos falls unencumbered and slams butt first into the
floorboards of the barn cracking them

ARAMIS AND ATHOS
can hear the crack from where theyre sitting

ARAMIS
I sawed the main beam in half

IN THE BARN

The chain reaction has just begun The broken floorboards
buckle and the barns walls deprived of their central
support fall in on each other

IN THE FRONT ROOM

Athos and Aramis watch wide-eyed as the whole barn completely

collapses around the unfortunate Porthos Athos gives Aramis
a look

ARAMIS
Im a genius -- not an engineer

They jump up and run out The commotion draws others too --
especially the three wenches Porthos had been trying to bed

THE COLLAPSED BARN

Its a tangle of debris -- and from the size and weight of
the pile it looks as if no one could live through the
collapse For a moment the whole pile lies silent then
suddenly it bursts apart and Porthos emerges exploding with
anger

PORTHOS
Aramis You did this didnt you
You knew I would try hanging myself
and you sawed the beam Admit it
Admit it by God ADMIT IT

Porthos eyes are bulging hes terrifying in his fury And
he holds one of the broken barns timbers like a giant club
ready to bash in Aramis brains Aramis is totally casual

ARAMIS
Well of course I knew it Porthos

Porthos stands there blinking

ARAMIS
Youve been moping for months Now
that youve gotten the idea of
killing yourself out of the way you
can stop boring me and start being
useful to me Now get some rest

PORTHOS
Well Well Okay

Porthos starts back toward the house Then one of the
serving girls heading back inside sees in one of the upper
windows -- the face in the Iron Mask She SCREAMS --

WENCH
AAAAAAHHHHHHH

Phillippe shies back from the window now but its too late
everyone has seen him Aramis with cold intellectual
curiosity quietly observes the womens reaction even as his
hooded helpers scurry from the shadows to calm the frightened
locals

ATHOS
Poor Phillippe

ARAMIS
The mask is terrifying especially
when unexpected Do you notice

ATHOS
All I noticed was that Phillippe
feels even more like an animal
Athos hurries in Aramis looks at Porthos

ARAMIS
See Porthos -- secrets are hard to
keep We dont have much time

INT PHILLIPPES BEDROOM - NIGHT

Athos enters to find Phillippe in a corner of the bedroom
slumped and ashamed in the darkness holding the mask

PHILLIPPE
Ive worn this mask so long I
couldnt sleep without it

ATHOS
I will sit with you I cant sleep
either

Athos settles into a chair as Phillippe lays the mask aside
on the table and closes his eyes Athos looks toward the
flames of the fireplace and in their dancing shadows he sees
the face of Raoul Phillippes voice interrupts --

PHILLIPPE
Athos Thank you for being my
guide back into the world

Athos had not thought of it that way Phillippe closes his
eyes again and falls asleep

INT PHILLIPPES BEDROOM —- MORNING

Light falls on Athos face it is dawn He hears the whinny
of horses and looks out the window to see a carriage about
to leave Reacting quickly he hurries out quietly

EXT CHATEAU - MORNING

Aramis and Porthos are already loaded into the carriage as
Athos runs up

ATHOS
Where are you going

ARAMIS
Paris There is still much to do
Well be back soon Be ready

ATHOS
But Aramis -- Phillippe can learn
in time but --

ARAMIS

He can learn to be Phillippe in
time But first he must learn to be
Louis and for that he has two more
days

ATHOS
What youre asking is impossible

ARAMIS
I offer you the perfect revolution
A revolution without bloodshed
without any loss of life even
without treason for he too is the
son of the King

ATHOS
But --

ARAMIS
You said youd do anything Athos
anything to replace this King So
do it

Aramis motions to the driver who snaps the reins and drives
the horses away

Athos wide-eyed and alone watches the carriage roll away
He turns back toward the house and sees Phillippe looking
out the window -- without the mask

INT MANOR HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

Athos and Phillippe are having breakfast

ATHOS
No wait do not hold your goblet
that way With a king it is so

He shows him pinching the goblet between thumb and
forefinger as the other three fingers extend daintily

ATHOS
It is not to be dainty Servants
have touched the Kings goblet so
he will touch it as little as
possible

Phillippe tries it and the goblet slips from his fingers
crashing onto his plate and spilling onto everything

PHILLIPPE
I am so sorry Forgive me I --

ATHOS
No Do not be sorry Never be
sorry The King cares for nothing
and for no one There are no
mistakes when you are King What
you do is right for every person A
King has contempt for everyone

PHILLIPPE
Is that the king of king you wish me
to be Or do you say this because
of your son

ATHOS
How did you know --
PHILLIPPE

Porthos told me

For a moment Athos can say nothing then he shoves back from
the table and storms from the room

INT COUNTRY MANOR HOUSE - ATHOS ROOM - NIGHT

Athos is pacing in his room all alone rehearsing the things
he wants to say to Phillippe

ATHOS

I am not I am not angry with you
You understand Good Now as to
acting like a king we wish you to
be a good king But at first at
first you must pass as Louis and
Louis is cold and cruel So you
must stop looking at people with
such softness It is not Kingly
The eyes of a King say that all he
cares about is himself and your
eyes -- how do I tell him this --

You eyes ask so much You
shouldnt care about me about my --
about

Athos voice breaks his body sags

ATHOS
Oh Raoul my son my son

Athos weeps
INT MANOR HOUSE - DAY

Phillippe sits alone in the parlor he looks up as Athos --
his face washed no sign of grief -- marches in

ATHOS
Come we have much to do

MONTAGE - ATHOS TRAINING PHILLIPPE

-- They practice sword fighting Athos being sure that
Phillippe knows Kingly posture

They rehearse holding court with Athos showing Phillippe
how to sit in a chair like a King on his throne and then
Phillippe trying it with Athos then playing the roll of a
courtesan paying homage

-- They rehearse courtly dancing and as they stumble both
of them feeling embarrassed and ridiculous they laugh

EXT PARIS STREET - NIGHT

Aramis carriage rattles to a stop the hooves of the horses
sounding hollow on the cobblestones They are near the same
area where the riots occurred now at night everything
looks deserted Aramis steps from the carriage

ARAMIS
Coming

PORTHOS
What use am I

ARAMIS
We go someplace dangerous
PORTHOS
Why didnt you say so

Porthos steps out with him and Aramis leads the way down a
dark spooky alley

EXT PARIS BACKSTREETS - NIGHT

They walk through the murky darkness of Paris backstreets

PORTHOS
It is good to be out on a mission
again We are out on a mission

arent we
Aramis grunts non-committally lost in thought

PORTHOS
Youre right Tell Porthos nothing
He needs to know nothing for he is
useless

Just as he says this a sinister form steps from the shadows
and blocks their way He holds a knife Another ROBBER with
a sword rises from a doorway beside them

ROBBER
Your money or your life

Aramis looks bored Porthos stands blinking in surprise
Then a third robber steps up behind them cocking a pistol

THIRD ROBBER
Make it quick old man

PORTHOS
Old Old Youre all trying to
rob us because you think were old

The man with a sword steps forward to hack Porthos down but
Porthos spins slapping the pistol making it BOOM but miss
he kicks the swordsman in the groin then smashes his head
against the alley wall he backhands the gunman The robber
with the knife tries to run Porthos snatches a barrel from
the street and hurls it into the fleeing robbers back he
falls in a heap

Porthos fury has just begun He picks the fallen gunman up
by the throat slams him stomach down across a broken alley

cart and with one sweep of his mighty hand Porthos snatches
down the mans pants

PORTHOS
Old Ill show you old

Porthos snatches the pistol from the cobblestones We see
the shock and terror on the robbers face as he feels
something shocking happen behind him
PORTHOS
Lets see you rob somebody with your

pistol there

ARAMIS
Come on

Aramis acting as if nothing happened leads Porthos away
PORTHOS
I have to tell you something I
love Paris

Aramis has found what hes looking for a filthy brothel

ARAMIS
Here we are

Aramis leads Porthos inside
INT BROTHEL - NIGHT
Sleazy whores lounge around women at the very bottom of

life They stir and try to look more appealing as the two
well dressed gentlemen enter

PORTHOS
Aramis These are these are
whores

ARAMIS

So was Mary Magdalene and our Lord
loved her

PORTHOS
Did she have tits like that

A greasy disgusting PIMP shuffles over
PIMP
What do you want White Black
Both

ARAMIS
No We want you Father Belles

The pimp reacts with fury drawing a pistol
PIMP
Get out Now I will kill you
where you stand

Aramis slowly falls to his knees before the pimp

ARAMIS
Bless me Father for I have sinned

The pimp -- the former Father Belles the same man we saw as
the priest who prayed with the Queen at the royal birth in
the opening -- shoves his pistol at Aramis face

PIMP

Dont Get out

ARAMIS
I have sinned And no other
priests assurance of forgiveness
can mean as much as yours Tell me
that I can be forgiven no matter
what I have done

Aramis eyes are hypnotic staring deep into the fallen
priests soul Porthos is bug-eyed certain Aramis head is
about to be blown apart

PORTHOS
Hes going to kill you Aramis

ARAMIS
Then let him kill me if all my
faith is wrong

He stares at the pimp The pimps finger trembles on the
trigger

ARAMIS
I have come to help you make it
right I have come to take you
home

The pimp shakes convulsively he drops to his knees bows his
head and weeps

Aramis carriage rattles through the dark streets we play
these secret movement sequences with an ominous Jack-the-
Ripper quality The carriage pulls into

then Porthos -- but the appearance of the pimp surprises the

cathedral priests They cross themselves

PRIESTS

Crossing themselves they embrace the prodigal priest one
MONK kneels before Aramis

MONK
You have made a miracle

ATHOS
But --

ARAMIS
It presses us but it is good for us
too Louis whims make him more

vulnerable We are less ready but
so are his guards

PORTHOS
DArtagnan unready

ATHOS
At a ball everyone watches the
King

ARAMIS
But what if something extraordinary
happened Something so unusual that
all the attention went to someone
else Someone whose confirmation of
Phillippe the King would never be
questioned

PORTHOS
Who

ARAMIS
The Queen Mother Anne

And Aramis leans forward to tell them his plan

He slides open the partition window between them

ANNE
Father Belles --

He taps a silencing finger to his lips

ANNE
They told me you were dead

FATHER BELLES
I was I see you are still a woman
of faith I have come back to ask
you if you believe that one lie can

poison your whole life and one
truth can put it back together
again

Anne stares at the eyes of the priest back from hell
INT PALACE - KINGS ROOM - DAY

As Louis tailors outfit him in a dazzling gold peacock
costume complete with a jeweled mask at the end of a wand
he amuses himself by looking out the window at the beautiful
young women arriving early for the ball

LOUIS
It shall be interesting tonight

DArtagnan enters looking concerned

DARTAGNAN
Your Majesty This ball with an
open invitation to the nobility of
Paris -- we have no way of
checking --

LOUIS
You will protect me as you always
have dArtagnan

Through the window Louis sees more beautiful young women

LOUIS

By the way Claude -- inform
Mademoiselle Beaufort that she will
be moving from her rooms --

He looks up to see that Michelle has entered through the open
door behind him

LOUIS
Never mind it seems we have already
told her

But Michelles appearance brings him up short It is not the
cruel brush-off she is already harshly different her eyes
are red from crying her lips are tight in anger
MICHELLE
Murderer Murderer

She holds a letter crushed in her hand

MICHELLE
I wrote Fromberge Under your seal
I wrote as you demanding to know
why he disregarded my order to keep
Raoul from danger He writes back
But your Majesty Your last letter
ordered me to put him in front of
the cannon

She hurls the crumpled letter into his face Everyone is
frozen silent She staggers toward Louis as if to attack
him then falls to her knees weeping No one helps her

Except dArtagnan He kneels hugs her shoulders helps her
to her feet and guides her toward her room But dArtagnan
looks back once toward Louis

LOUIS
Hysterical woman

CLAUDE
Sire misuse of the royal seal --

LOUIS
Shell be gone tomorrow

As dArtagnan and Michelle move out they pass Anne coming
in Anne and dArtagnan exchange a look he remembers to
give her a respectful nod but she moves past into the
Kings dressing room Louis is surprised

LOUIS
Mother --

ANNE
May I speak with you Alone

LOUIS
I am preparing for a ball

ANNE
We havent visited in three years
And we should have privacy
Exasperated Louis waves his attendants away

LOUIS
What is it mother

ANNE
I wish to discuss your brother

LOUIS
He is dead By Gods choice There
is nothing to discuss

ANNE
First they told me he had died at
birth Then your father admitted he
was alive but well cared for in
secret But the message that told
of his death said he had been a
prisoner

LOUIS
I am King Mother And I do not
wish to discuss this with you

ANNE
He was my blood -- and I demand to
know what happened to him

LOUIS
Why would you ask now You never
asked before

ANNE
Because I have dreamed of him Not
as the baby they took away but as a

man
LOUIS

You have prayed too much Your mind

is weak

Avoiding her stare Louis lifts a plaster bust of his father
its eyes like the sightless pupils of Greek gods

ANNE
I believe in dreams Louis They
are our souls speaking to us from
that world beyond our eyes And
that son I never saw in daylight was
standing in the moonlight of my
dreams And he wore an iron mask

We see her from a low angle from a POV behind Louis -- and
we see the plaster bust burst upon the marble floor

LOUIS
It -- it doesnt matter Mother He
is dead now Dead

ANNE
Yes Dead Two nights ago The
night of my dream

And the night of Louis dream Anne begins to walk out
LOUIS
If if he was wearing an iron mask

in your dream then how could you
know he was your son

Louis smiles he thinks he has her

ANNE
Then you did do it Louis You did
put your brother in an iron mask

All the blood is gone from Louis face Anne walks from the
room past Louis waiting tailors He snaps at them

LOUIS
I have a ball to attend

They rush in As they scurry about dressing him in gold
Louis composure returns he stares at himself in the golden
mirror likes what he sees and smiles

EXT ROAD - NIGHT

Aramis carriage pulls off the road and into the trees The
Musketeers and Phillippe pile out to find another much
grander carriage there waiting Aramis ushers them into it

PHILLIPPE
Whose carriage is this

PORTHOS
It was mine But since you are
about to be the king it is yours
The new carriage lurches away
INSIDE THE NEW CARRIAGE
are bundles of elaborate clothes

ARAMIS
Phillippe first

They begin to dress Phillippe in a masquerade costume

ARAMIS
Remember Phillippe nobility is
born in the heart

ATHOS
Hold your goblet with two fingers

PORTHOS

And make love as if you dont care
The way Kings do And fart whenever
you wish

Aramis tucks a note into Phillippes pocket

ARAMIS
Remember all you have to do is get
through tonight Smile and nod a
lot and if you get stuck just wave
and announce Continue In the
morning you hand this note to
dArtagnan pardoning Athos and
instructing that he Aramis and
Porthos be brought to the palace as
your advisors And all is well

Phillippe nods everyones nervous Aramis grabs more
clothes and hands them out

ARAMIS
Now the rest of us

EXT THE PALACE - NIGHT

Carriages disgorge guests wildly attired for the masquerade
ball Porthos carriage pulls in among them

INT PALACE BALLROOM - NIGHT
A magnificent masquerade ball is in full swirl the dazzling
light of chandeliers bounces off the gilt ceiling and
sparkles on the jewels of swirling dancers their numbers
multiplied in the polished mirrors that line the walls

The King is dancing and laughing with sexy young ladies
DArtagnan stands to the side of the ballroom ever watchful
ever remote

As the dancers swirl each one wearing a distinctive mask in
the garish style favored by the French nobility of the
1600s we see one particular couple -- a large man with an
excessively large woman They are dancing vigorously and as
they take a break behind a huge pillar they lift their masks
enough for us to see that the man is Aramis and the woman
is Porthos

From the folds of their elaborate costumes they both withdraw
replicas of the iron mask that Phillippe once wore

PORTHOS
DArtagnan watches everything We
have to be lucky

ARAMIS
We will make our own luck tonight
if Phillippe holds up

Aramis peers across the ballroom to where Athos and
Phillippe mix among the revelers using thin sticks to hold
broad masks to their faces Behind the masks we see their
eyes -- Athos intense Phillippes nervous and darting

ATHOS
Stay calm youre doing fine

Then Phillippes eyes go strangely still he sees for the
first time in his life his twin brother the King

PHILLIPPE
My brother

Louis dances the minuet prancing as if he is the center of
the universe but this bliss is broken when one of the
dancers who swirls by him -- it is Aramis -- lifts the
baroque outer mask hes wearing and reveals an iron mask
beneath
The King staggers stopping The sight stuns him confuses
him he looks around but the wearer of the mask has
disappeared among the weaving patterns of dancers Louis
hands dart to his eyes are they playing tricks on him

Seeing his reaction Phillippe whispers --
PHILLIPPE
He knew He knew what they did to
me

The YOUNG BEAUTY dancing with Louis notices him falter

YOUNG BEAUTY
What is wrong your majesty

LOUIS
Nothing I -- continue
Louis rejoins the dancing and then sees on the balcony
above him a different person -- a huge woman Porthos --

who lifts off an outer mask to reveal an iron mask below

LOUIS
There Do you see it

YOUNG BEAUTY
See what Majesty

Porthos has slipped away from the railing when the King looks
back up the young beauty sees nothing and turns back to the
King with a look that questions his sanity

DArtagnan notices the Kings reaction -- though he did not
see the glimpse of the iron mask -- and is just as baffled as
everyone else when the King turns and staggers away

DARTAGNAN
Your Majesty

LOUIS
tired Must lie down

The music splatters to an awkward stop Louis hurries out
leaving his partner abandoned in the center of the ballroom
with everyone staring as if she just ruined the party

DARTAGNAN
Carry on everyone
The music begins again and the party goers not knowing what
else to do politely continue

Athos draws Phillippe away from the ballroom into a side
corridor

AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS TO THE BALCONY
Porthos waddles down stairs and meets Aramis

ARAMIS
Quick to the passages

They hurry in the same direction Athos and Phillippe went
INT PALACE HALLWAY - OUTSIDE THE KINGS BEDROOM - NIGHT

DArtagnan catches up to the King as he is entering the door
of his royal apartment

INT PALACE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

he three Musketeers and Phillippe move quietly up a stairway
and to the door of a room Phillippe whispers

PHILLIPPE
The room of the Kings favorite
mistress

ATHOS

She will be at the ball
INT MICHELLES APARTMENT - NIGHT

The door opens and they move in it is in fact empty though
amess They move to the wall where Aramis after a little
looking locates the levers to open the walldoor to the
Kings secret passageway Aramis enters first the others
follow We half expect Michelle to pop up at any moment but
the Musketeers enter the passage without incident
INT SECRET PASSAGES - NIGHT

Aramis silently leads the others through the secret passage
to the portal into the Kings bedroom

INT KINGS BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

The King is lying on the bed we see him from the POV of
someone approaching him slowly silently When his eyes open
in panic it is too late We see Aramis Athos Porthos
from the KINGS POV as they swarm him

ARAMIS
It is Judgment Day

His fist drops into frame Louis loses consciousness
LOUIS POV

as consciousness returns He see Phillippe in Louis
clothes Aramis Athos and Porthos bow and say

MUSKETEERS
Your Majesty

LOUIS still on his bed now wears Phillippes clothes

LOUIS
Wh-- Wha--

ARAMIS
Dont look so shocked Phillippe
Come youre going back to prison

LOUIS
Phillippe Why do you call me --

Now Louis understands everything He tries to struggle but
instantly Porthos shoves a rag into his mouth

Aramis opens the main door a crack and sees dArtagnan has
entered his room down the corridor through whose open door
he can guard the approaches to the Kings rooms Aramis
shuts the door again and turns to the others

ARAMIS
DArtagnan guards the hallway You
must go back the way we came
Athos puts his hands on Phillippes shoulders

ATHOS
Now your Majesty It is time

Aramis and Porthos bow again to Phillippe -- now dressed and
looking exactly like the King Phillippes mouth is dry he
swallows hard and follows Athos up the hidden stairs

INT MICHELLES BEDCHAMBER

Athos and Phillippe move to the door they stop there and
Athos adjusts Phillippes costume one more time

ATHOS
You know the way

Phillippe nods tremendously nervous

ATHOS
You have your note

Phillippe pats his pocket like a boy being sent off to his
first day at school He surprises Athos hugging him Then
Phillippe opens the door and walks slowly down the hallway
Athos stands at the door and watches him go all alone
Athos whispers though Phillippe cant hear

ATHOS
You have the heart of a king

Reluctantly he shuts the door behind Phillippe
IN THE HALLWAY FOLLOWING PHILLIPPE

as he conducts himself through the ornate corridor down the
gilded staircase and into --

INT BALLROOM - NIGHT
Phillippe enters the ballroom and the reappearance of the
King draws new attention Everyone in the dazzling

ballroom seems to stop and look straight at Phillippe

Phillippe freezes Stares everywhere stares For what
seems an eternity he cant move
But then he raises his hand and says --

PHILLIPPE
Continue

As if by magic the music plays the dancing resumes
Phillippe moves to the throne and takes his place upon it
He seems to have made it people glance -- dancing ladies
young Musketeers old advisors -- but no one gives hima
second look For a moment Phillippe feels safe

And then he sees Michelle her eyes glassy and riveted upon
him She wears her most beautiful gown -- the first one
Louis gave her -- but one shoulder strap dangles sloppily
Her lips and cheeks are awkwardly rouged her hair is mussed
she is drunk She weaves her way to him and curtsies
elaborately

MICHELLE
My gracious noble lord

Phillippes heart is pounding he looks around for help He
can only guess who this woman is The advisors have now
noticed her Claude quickly dispatches orders to keep the
party going along and waves guards over

PHILLIPPE
How are you Michelle

She doesnt react so he must have guessed right but
Phillippe knows nothing of what happened just before the
ball and hes ambushed by her anger

MICHELLE
How should I be I came to give
this back to you

She starts tearing off her dress Claude and the guards
reach her the young Musketeers grabbing her

CLAUDE
Fret not with this your Majesty --

But Michelle fights slapping clawing -- and when one of the
young Musketeers grabs her from behind his arm to her
throat Phillippe jumps up

PHILLIPPE
Stop Youre hurting her
Phillippes face shows something Louis never did
compassion He looks into Michelles eyes

PHILLIPPE
However I have wronged you I will
make amends Whatever the cost

Phillippe could not have said anything more unlike Louis
everyone who heard the remark -- Claude the guards and
especially Michelle -- stare at him in frozen amazement

Phillippe realizes his blunder theyve caught him

The MUSIC STOPS But the attention is not directed at the
throne all eyes shift to the main doorway where Anne has
appeared She is indescribably beautiful she wears a bright
gown her hair is brushed and bejeweled she radiates the
light of a woman who felt old at thirty and who has
discovered at forty that she is more stunning than ever

Her arrival draws even more attention than the reappearance
of the King everyone watches transfixed as she approaches
Phillippe sees her -- his mother He stands on legs that

seem to have no bones His mother

She moves to him her eyes filling with tears When she is
almost to the throne Phillippe falls to his knees before her
and kisses her hand

No one can believe it not from this King Yet the moment
strikes them as beautiful and they applaud happily

Phillippe and the Queen Mother rise and guide each other --
depending on each other for support to a seat he on the
throne she on a seat the servants place beside him

Phillippe gives a wave

PHILLIPPE
Continue

The ball continues the music exuberant Michelle wanders
away like a blind lamb Phillippe and his mother sit side
by side holding hands their reunion passing in private
between their clasped hands and glistening in their eyes

INT THE PALACE CORRIDOR - NIGHT
Michelle alone and forgotten staggers down the corridor
toward the Kings rooms she passes dArtagnans open door

INT THE KINGS BEDCHAMBER - THE THREE MUSKETEERS

are tidying everything up they have Louis gagged and trussed
up hand and foot his eyes flashing hatred

ATHOS
Dont worry your Majesty We have
a prison for you where you can rest
peacefully

Porthos drapes Louis over his shoulder and they move into
the passages Just as they close the portal behind them the
door opens and Michelle wanders in like a zombie Suddenly
dArtagnan is at her shoulder

DARTAGNAN
Michelle --

Then he sees the room is empty he thought Louis was here

DARTAGNAN
Where is he
MICHELLE
In the ballroom But he isnt

the same man
INT BALLROOM - NIGHT
As a minuet ends Claude raises his glass in a toast
CLAUDE
To King Louis And to Anne the

Queen Mother

The guests applaud and reach for wine glasses servants
present Phillippe and Anne with champagne and they sip --

GUESTS
To King Louis and the Queen Mother

Everyone drinks Phillippe suddenly remembers to hold his
glass in his fingertips -- and it slips through his nervous

fingers hitting the floor with a crash

Dead silence everyone is looking Then Anne drops her glass
too -- and everybody does it
part of the celebration

As the music begins again

ANNE
I retire now Wait two waltzes
then retire to your room and spend
the night in safety We have much
to talk about and have the rest of
our lives to do it

PHILLIPPE
Good night Mother

ANNE

as if to break the glass is

Anne leans to Phillippe --

Good night my son

She kisses him on the cheek
She moves to the door

it brings tears to both of them

everyone bowing as she leaves

JUST OUTSIDE THE BALLROOM DOOR

Anne encounters dArtagnan

He stops so taken by the sight

of her that no one seeing them could miss that he loves her

DARTAGNAN

Anne You look --

Remembering himself

he bows deeply

DARTAGNAN

ANNE
DArtagnan

She takes his hand

INT BALLROOM - NIGHT

DArtagnan sees Louis sitting on the throne More baffled
than alarmed he grabs one of the Musketeer guards near him

DARTAGNAN
How long has the King been back

GUARD
Some while Captain

DARTAGNAN
He didnt pass my doorway I was in
my room

GUARD

He mustve Captain there is no
other way here

DArtagnan stands and thinks his mind begins to spin

PHILLIPPE

sees dArtagnan staring at him then calling more guards
over and giving them quick instructions the guards hurry
away Then dArtagnan moves to Phillippe and bows He
looks at him carefully but seems to see nothing unusual

PHILLIPPE
Continue
DARTAGNAN
Sire we have an emergency -- of

security I must ask you to
accompany me

PHILLIPPE
The ball Continue

DARTAGNAN
I must insist Sire

Phillippe stands and follows dArtagnan from the ball
INT PASSAGES TO RIVER - NIGHT
Aramis Athos and Porthos -- carrying Louis -- descend the

secret passages to the foundations of the palace into a
drainage channel leading to the river
They have stashed a boat there they plop Louis into it and
climb in themselves They row toward the archway that is the
exit to the river the moonlit waters of the Seine glow
outside like a beacon of safe escape

But the steel grate of the archway slams down just before
they reach it and blades point at them from every angle of
the darkness A shielded lantern rises and its wick is
turned up revealing

DARTAGNAN

he stands with a small contingent of young Musketeers His
eyes are intense his face in agony

DARTAGNAN
My friends

The only one they can see it dArtagnan They all look at
each other in the small circle of light from the lantern

DARTAGNAN
Only we four the most trusted
Musketeers knew about the passages
meant to keep the King safe Your
Majesty

Phillippe steps out of the darkness his eyes are full of
shame and failure as he looks at Athos but still he holds
on trying to maintain the charade that he is Louis

PHILLIPPE
Yes Why do you bring me here
dArtagnan

PORTHOS

The King Look Its the King
He means Phillippe

DARTAGNAN
Then who is that lying beside you

Porthos turns and looks at Louis -- then reacts as if hes
totally surprised at the presence of this man tied up and
gagged beside him

PORTHOS
Wh-- Where did he come from
Athos grabs dArtagnans arm

ATHOS
If you ever loved me -- if you ever
loved honor or anything else --
then stand now and let it happen

DARTAGNAN
I cannot Athos Dearly as I love
you I cannot

DArtagnan takes his dagger and cuts the ropes that bind
Louis hands and the gag that has kept him from talking
Aramis suddenly backhands Louis knocking him flat on his
back in the boat and pointing to him -- Louis

ARAMIS
This man is an impostor We caught
him trying to impersonate the King
and were just getting rid of him

Louis struggles upright

LOUIS
DArtagnan arrest them all

ARAMIS
Shut up knave

Aramis slaps Louis again and pleads with his eyes that
dArtagnan accept their ruse DArtagnan is dying inside

DARTAGNAN
Before I came here I insisted the
King come with me The real Louis
would never have let me insist

Seeing they are about to be arrested the old Musketeers in
the boat spring into action against their younger
counterparts Athos swats one swordsman with an oar Porthos
seizes the guard who has grabbed a hold of the boat and
flings the man back into two of his comrades Aramis grabs
Louis by the hair and puts his dagger to his throat

ARAMIS
Pull them back dArtagnan

DARTAGNAN
You cant do it

ARAMIS
Pull them back

DARTAGNAN
Everyone back

ARAMIS
Phillippe get into the boat Into
the boat Now

Phillippe obeys

ARAMIS
Open the gate

DArtagnan nods to his men and they open the iron gate
leading out to the river

The boat makes for the opening Just as it is about to reach
it Louis forces Aramis hand

LOUIS
You will not shed royal blood

He kicks at the boat and struggles to stand making the boat
tip wildly and throwing everyone in it all around Aramis
draws the dagger away from Louis throat to keep from killing
him and dArtagnan makes a grab at Louis and drags him onto
the stone floor of the channel

The boat is almost through the opening -- and Louis snatches
at his brother Phillippe

The current outside the gate is rushing by and the boat is
already caught in the current its pulling away and the
Musketeers cant stop it Athos seizes Phillippes legs and
tries to hold him but the pressure of the current is great
and now not only Louis but some of the young Musketeers are
helping hold Phillippe

Phillippes legs slip out of Athos grasp and the boat
flashes downriver

Aramis Porthos and Athos have escaped but Phillippe is
captured looking into the hate-filled eyes of his twin
brother Louis
INT SECRET PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

Louis is angrily climbing through the passageways back up
into the main floors of the palace venting his emotions at
dArtagnan just behind him the young Musketeers with
Phillippe their prisoner follow along further back

LOUIS
I want all these passages sealed
Another stupid idea of my fathers
Seal them all every one

DARTAGNAN
It shall be done your Majesty

LOUIS
Even the bedchamber passages Let
none remain

DARTAGNAN
Yes your Majesty

They reach a doorway and the King bangs through it into his
own bedchamber still spouting anger

LOUIS
I was told this impostor was dead

DARTAGNAN
You knew you had a double

LOUIS
He is my brother

DArtagnan is frozen in surprise Phillippe and his guards
move into the room seeing him in full light wearing Louis
own clothes fans Louis anger he jumps forward and begins
ripping the royal garments off Phillippe

DArtagnan forces himself between Louis and Phillippe

DARTAGNAN
I -- I thought he was but an
impostor who resembled --

LOUIS
My twin Which has kept him alive
Until now
ANNES VOICE
No

They whirl to see the Queen Mother who has entered through
the main door She hurries to the space between her sons
hugging Phillippe then trying to hug Louis

ANNE
Louis please --
LOUIS
My guards are useless Take her

from me

He motions to the young Musketeers to restrain her
reluctantly they grip the arms of the Queen Mother

LOUIS
What had you to do with this
Mother

ANNE

He is your brother

LOUIS
He is nothing now

Louis draws a sword from the scabbard of one of the young

Musketeers -- but dArtagnan steps between him and Phillippe
DARTAGNAN
Your Majesty This man before
you He is royal blood the same

as you To spill it is the one
thing even you cannot do It is
against the laws of God and of
France

LOUIS
Get out of my way

DARTAGNAN
Not once have I ever asked anything
for myself I ask now Forgive
this man this prisoner your

brother

LOUIS
Forgive

DARTAGNAN

Aramis Porthos and Athos too I
know what they have done was a
threat against you -- and yet that
threat has been removed with no
harm coming to your Majesty If
their passions were in error their
spirits have ever been noble
Forgive them

LOUIS
They have plotted against me Me
The embodiment of Gods will

DArtagnan sinks to his knees before the king

DARTAGNAN

Your Majesty Every day of your
life I have watched over you No
angel could have stood a more
faithful vigil I have bled for
you and have prayed every day to
see you become greater than your
office better than the law Show
me now what my faith and blood have
purchased Show mercy

The words cut into everyone Anne Phillippe the young
Musketeers But Louis eyes are cold as he responds --

LOUIS
You take the side of traitors

PHILLIPPE
Please may I speak Mlord I
beg that you kill me I release
you before Almighty God from any
claim of sin in taking my life In
fact I will pray that God reward you
for your mercy to do it But do not
-- I beg you -- return me to the
prison where I have lived so long

Phillippes plea makes Louis pause then smile

LOUIS
DArtagnan you will hunt down
Aramis Porthos and Athos and bring
me their heads or I will have
yours And as for you Phillippe
Back to the prison you shall go and
into the mask you hate

ANNE
No Louis No

LOUIS
Wear it until you love it And die
in it

Anne screams and Louis waves to the guards who draw her
from the room as dArtagnan sags on his knees before the
King he has served so faithfully

Slowly Phillippe lowers his head
INT DARTAGNANS ROOM

DArtagnan returns to his bare room he sits down upon the
bed and drops his face into his hands

Then he hears the sound like a SCREAM but short and
muffled almost like the whelp of a kicked dog He lifts his
head sharply where did that sound come from He is almost
too tired too sad to investigate

Then the King already shaken by the nights events hurries
into dArtagnans room

LOUIS
What was that sound Did you hear
it It came from Michelles room
INT KINGS BEDCHAMBER
DArtagnan enters ahead of Louis They see nothing unusual
and dArtagnan moves up the hidden stairs toward Michelles
apartment

MICHELLES APARTMENT

DArtagnan enters the room and finds it empty -- but the
window is open He moves toward it

INT KINGS BEDCHAMBER
The King is pacing as dArtagnan reappears

LOUIS
Where is Michelle

DARTAGNAN
There

He points to the window Louis shoves open the drapes and
leaps back in horror Michelle has hanged herself outside
Louis window the golden bunting of her bed tied as a noose
around her neck

INT QUEEN MOTHERS APARTMENTS - DAWN

Anne has changed she is tormented but alive with energy
pacing There is a knock at her door and the old nun opens
it to dArtagnan The old nun leaves them alone dArtagnan
moves to Anne and takes her hands to look into her eyes

DARTAGNAN
There were two Not one But two

ANNE
I couldnt tell you You had enough
to carry

DARTAGNAN
Anne The night we had together

I always wanted more But that one
it was enough Enough to make me
love you forever I want you to
remember that and go on As
strong as you are now No matter
what happens

He kisses her She drinks in his love Then he stands and
moves to the door He looks back then stares out

ANNE
DArtagnan --

He looks back once more he seems to want to tell her
something but whatever it is he cant find the words and
with a last loving look at her he walks away

EXT ESTABLISHING THE BASTILLE - NIGHT

A sudden visual establishing the Bastille the horrific
legendary prison of Paris
INT BASTILLE - NIGHT

Phillippe his head covered in a burlap hood is rushed
through the twisting stairways of the prison

INT A CELL IN THE BOWELS OF THE BASTILLE
The guards remove the hood and Phillippe sees the cell

Then he sees the blacksmith there with a new iron mask and
his eyes take on a fresh horror

PHILLIPPE
No Please No

The guards seize him and the blacksmith places the mask over
Phillippes face as he screams They seal the mask with a
small padlock whose key is distinctive and jeweled

INT BASTILLE - LATER

The two guards and the blacksmith are coming downstairs after
completing their work Far above them in the prison tower
the cries of the prisoner echo he sounds like a raving
madman now

The two guards and the blacksmith enter an office at the base
of the tower the BASTILLE JAILER looks up

BLACKSMITH
Pay me quick I want out of here

Soldiers swords drawn appear in the doorway behind them

GUARDS
What --

BASTILLE JAILER
You saw the prisoners face

Understanding the blacksmith raises his hammer toward the
soldiers but he is stabbed in the back by the jailer and
the soldiers skewer the two guards who helped him A soldier
lifts the jeweled key from the hand of a dead guard

THE KEY

is handed to the King by Andre the young Lieutenant Louis
hangs the key around his own neck with a thin gold chain

LOUIS
Now Where is dArtagnan

LIEUTENANT
Out directing the search for the
traitors

LOUIS

When he returns watch him When he
leaves again you tell me

The Lieutenant bows Louis smiles and fingers the key
EXT PARIS STREETS - NIGHT

Squads of young Musketeers gallop along the river and
through the dark streets around it searching

ALONG THE BACK WALL OF NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL three forms
scurry through the darkness Aramis Porthos and Athos
heaving wheezing They duck into a niche of the wall to
avoid capture from another patrol galloping by Then Aramis
unlocks a door in the cathedral wall and they stagger in

INT CATACOMBS

The three Musketeers struggle through the catacombs reach
the chapel and fall gasping to the floor

ARAMIS
Bloody hell

ATHOS
We cant stay here That traitor
dArtagnan knows about this
place

PORTHOS
Can we eat before we go This

excitements given me an appetite

ARAMIS
Bread and wine in that cupboard

Porthos hauls himself to his feet and turns up the wick of
the lantern The rising light reveals a note stuck to the
cupboard with the blade of a dagger
PORTHOS
A note Pinned with a dagger like
the old days

He removes the note and reads

PORTHOS
Phillippe has been removed to the
Bastille to the lower dungeon At
midnight tonight I will order the
guard changed and will delay the
replacements for ten minutes That
should give you ample time Never
have I needed more to say One for
all and all for one DArtagnan

ATHOS
He lures us to capture

ARAMIS
He seeks redemption

ATHOS
Youre a fool

ARAMIS
Perhaps But of dArtagnan I am
certain What he did tonight was
what he told us all along he would
do -- be faithful to his King

ATHOS
So what has changed

ARAMIS
Perhaps he serves a different king

PORTHOS
What choice is there If Phillippe
is in the Bastille then to the
Bastille we will go

ATHOS
You are right But it is a trap

PORTHOS
So what Id rather die covered in
blood than an old man lying in my
own piss

ARAMIS
Then to the Bastille

ATHOS
To the Bastille And death

EXT BASTILLE - NIGHT

The stone walls rising into the Paris night seem to ooze
evil The building looks impossible to get into much less
get out of its doors appear to be solid blocks of wood
encased in stone ramparts

We hear a sharp echoing KNOCK Aramis Athos and Porthos
stand outside the main entrance Athos slumped between the
other two like a beaten captive being delivered to jail

No one answers their knock the three Musketeers exchange
doubtful glance and Porthos knocks again A guard inside
slides open a view port of the massive door

PORTHOS
Open up We have a prisoner

The port shuts bolts rattle and the great door heaves open
The Musketeers glance at each other again and play their
roles Aramis and Porthos dragging Athos inside

INT THE BASTILLE - MAIN COURTYARD - NIGHT

The prison courtyard is murky in the darkness and ringed by
doors leading into mazes of corridors to its dungeons

GUARD
Take him down to level three The

Captain will see to the documents

Aramis and Porthos drag Athos into one of the shadowy portals
surrounding the courtyard

INT BASTILLE - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT
The three Musketeers duck into the inky shadows Aramis cuts
the bonds that hold Athos hands and gives him the extra

sword he had beneath his cloak

PORTHOS
It worked

ATHOS
Its a prison you idiot They
dont expect anyone to try getting
in The problem will come when we
want out

Aramis shushes them and leads them into another quiet
corridor They hear the distant bells of a church then
suddenly they must scramble as a platoon of guards carrying
torches troop up stairs into the corridor the Musketeers
dart like rats into dark nooks as the guards pass the
Musketeers huddle and the bells end their tolling

ARAMIS
Midnight We have ten minutes

They press on deeper into the Bastille

INT PALACE - ANNES ROOM - NIGHT

Anne moves to the window where she starts to kneel for her
nightly prayer but she stops Outside in the garden far
below her window is dArtagnan on horseback waiting Their
eyes connect He has a single rose in his hand Never
taking his eyes from her he places the rose on the stone

bench of the garden and reins his horse away

Then she understands what he was trying to tell her before
in the hallway it was goodbye

EXT PALACE GARDEN - NIGHT

DArtagnan rides away quickly passing -- without seeing --
Lieutenant Andre who has been watching him

EXT PARIS STREETS - NIGHT

Through the night dArtagnan gallops We see his destination
in the distance the Bastille

EXT THE PALACE GATES - NIGHT
The great gates of the palace swing slowly open and out ride
a whole platoon of young Musketeers surrounding Louis

himself on horseback and dressed like a soldier

INT THE BASTILLE - VARIOUS SHOTS
The three Musketeers scramble down a flight of stairs
through another corridor down another stairway They pass
cells wretched prisoners look up but none of them is
Phillippe Then the Musketeers surprise a JAILER

JAILER
Hey

But before the man can say anything else Porthos has crushed
him like a bug against the wall They rip the huge ring of
keys from the jailers waist and take his torch

PHILLIPPES CELL

He lies on the floor he sees the light of a torch coming to
him like sunrise and then he hears a voice --

ATHOS
Phillippe

PHILLIPPE
How did you --

They open the door and release him -- from the cell but not
from the mask He tries to hug Athos

They head back the way they came
EXT PARIS STREETS - NIGHT

Louis and his platoon of young Musketeers ride through the
streets scattering the paupers who sleep there

INT BASTILLE - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT

Back up the stairs through one corridor they start up
the second flight of stairs then stop and scramble back

ARAMIS
(whispering)

Someones coming

They take cover on either side of the corridor and lift

their swords Its a man coming down the stairs with a
hooded lantern they raise their swords to strike --
PORTHOS

DArtagnan
DARTAGNAN
The way is blocked above The
Captain of the Bastille has turned
back from the mission I sent him on
and is in the courtyard with a party
of men

ATHOS
He lies He is here to trap us

DARTAGNAN
I came to see you safely out Check
for yourself

Porthos climbs the stairs to check DArtagnan looks at
Phillippe in the mask

DARTAGNAN
All you have suffered I would
gladly have borne myself to keep it
from you

Athos spits on the floor in derision But Porthos comes
barreling back down the stairway

PORTHOS
DArtagnan is right the courtyard
is filling with soldiers

DARTAGNAN
This way

He leads them quickly down a side corridor the others have
no choice but to follow

A SIDE CORRIDOR

DArtagnan leads them around another corner into a long
corridor at the end of it is a massive door They reach it
and dArtagnan produces a set of keys marked with the royal
seal of the Musketeers he begins unlocking the three
padlocks that secure the door

DARTAGNAN
Once you are through dont stop

until you reach the river

ARAMIS
They will know you helped us if we
go this way

DARTAGNAN
That doesnt matter now

They open the door and as they do they see Louis and his
platoon of young Musketeers arriving outside

LOUIS
There Stop them

ATHOS
Betrayed

The young Musketeers serving the King jump from their horses
and grab for the door but dArtagnan leaps forward his
sword flashing After a second of surprise Athos Aramis
and Porthos jump forward too and there is a brief bloody
skirmish at the door But the young Musketeers have
overwhelming numbers and firearms too protecting Phillippe
the old Musketeers draw back inside and succeed at pulling
the door shut and latching it quickly

ARAMIS
Back the way we came

They race back up the corridor -- the four Musketeers and
Phillippe in the iron mask -- and turn the corner They
reach another inner door pass through it -- and see the

soldiers of the Bastille coming at them

ARAMIS
Back

They retreat and Porthos slams the second door Like all
the inner doors of the Bastille its heavy wood a foot
thick and Porthos seals it with a huger iron bar But
theres nowhere else to run

ATHOS
Trapped

At the far end of the corridor the Kings young Musketeers
have the same keys to the outer door that dArtagnan did and
they are breaking through Louis and two dozen of his
personal bodyguard pour through the door

LOUIS
Charge them
The young Musketeers obediently charge down the corridor

tepping up shoulder to shoulder -- Aramis dArtagnan

thos Porthos -- the four veteran Musketeers meet the

harge first with pistols then with swords a wall between
ouis men and Phillippe The battle in the cramped confines
f the corridor is bloody and fierce the young attackers can
nly get a few men into the fight at any one time and those
ho step before the famous veterans are cut down

Sooraprn

Louis young Musketeers retreat to regroup
AT LOUIS END OF THE CORRIDOR

Louis is furious jumping at Lieutenant Andre who has
dragged a wounded comrade back from the fight

LOUIS
Cowards Twenty run from four

LIEUTENANT
The corridor nullifies our number
And no one has stomach to fight the
Captain

Louis is disgusted by this loyalty -- and he has a solution

LOUIS
DArtagnan

AT THE OTHER END OF THE CORRIDOR

Louis voice echoes down to the veteran Musketeers and
Phillippe in the Iron Mask

LOUIS VOICE
I am not angry with you I knew you
would lead me to them and so you
have Lay down your sword and I
will not punish you I will let you
retire in peace -- to live out your
days in the countryside And I will
give your friends a swift execution
if you surrender now

The words bounce down the long corridor then silence
DArtagnan stands holding his sword staring away from his
friends toward the King and his gang of young Musketeers

ARAMIS
DArtagnan Perhaps you should
accept his offer for we are dead
anyway

PORTHOS
He is right dArtagnan

Athos says nothing but when dArtagnan looks at him he
lowers his eyes in shame for ever having doubted dArtagnans
loyalty and friendship

Phillippe speaks up from behind the Iron Mask

PHILLIPPE
Wait Bargain me to Louis for all
your lives You have done your
best Let me go and let all of you
find peace

DARTAGNAN
No Even if I could give up my
friends I could never give up my
son

This hits them like a bombshell -- and suddenly it all makes
sense dArtagnans loyalty to Louis his dogged hope that he
could somehow influence him toward goodness We see their
stunned faces each in turn Athos Aramis Porthos and
Phillippe

DARTAGNAN
I never had any idea you existed
until they found you And in all
that time I never had a moments
pride as a father -- until now

DArtagnan and Phillippe embrace lost father to lost son

From the heavily barred door to their rear comes a powerful
pounding the Bastilles soldiers are trying to break it
down Time is running out

Aramis looks back down the corridor toward the door to the
outside barred now by Louis and his young guards their long
muskets bristling like spikes and yet that way is the only
possible hope for escape to the outside
ARAMIS
DArtagnan Those are young
Musketeers down there They have
been weaned on our legends They
revere us -- it is an advantage
Why dont we charge them

DARTAGNAN
I trained those men myself They
will stand and fight But if we are
to die let it be this way

He draws his sword and points it into the air Aramis lifts
the tip of his sword to join that of dArtagnan Porthos

does too and then Athos joins them
ATHOS
One for all All for one
PHILLIPPE

If I could have a blade then I
would be please to run with you

DArtagnan gives Phillippe a dagger They look at each
other Then dArtagnan begins to scream The others take up
the shout Then they step around the corner and charge

THE LAST CHARGE OF THE MUSKETEERS

We film it in all its glory a visual feast the Last Charge
of the Musketeers Their capes swirl about time their hair
flies their legs take on new life

At first the young Musketeers at the end of the corridor are
frozen in surprise their youthful Lieutenant is awed by the
dashing beautiful bravery of the thing

LIEUTENANT
Magnificent valor

LOUIS
Shoot them Shoot them

Louis grabs a musket from one of the reluctant soldiers and
fires SSSBOOM With the first explosion of gunfire the
others pull their triggers the powder in their weapons
flashes and crashes
The musket balls fly down the hallway sparking off the stone
walls and floor ricocheting punching holes through the
capes and flesh but still the Musketeers charge like the
young men they once were -- still are in spirit

In the confines of the Bastilles stone corridor the noise is
deafening and the space in front of the guards is filled
with the dense gray smoke of the gunpowder None of them can
see anything beyond it and all is quiet

LIEUTENANT
Draw blades

The Kings Guards draw their swords and wait are all the
old Musketeers dead

Slowly the figures emerge from the smoke -- in SLOW MOTION
walking now no need to run All are wounded but all are
still alive

The Four Musketeers along with Phillippe move slowly and
steadily toward the blades of the young Guards a fight to
the death So be it

But the young Lieutenant will have none of it as one of his
men lifts a sword to plunge it into the chest of dArtagnan
the young Lieutenant bats the sword down with his own

LIEUTENANT
Stop

He steps forward toward dArtagnan but instead of thrusting
his sword he salutes with it

His men follow suit saluting and bowing to the courage of
these men they have grown up wanting to follow

King Louis for the moment is frozen
DArtagnan looks back at Phillippe he has bullet holes in
two different places at the edges of his clothes but he is

unwounded

Then dArtagnan sees Louis with his long dagger leaping at
Phillippe

DARTAGNAN
No
DArtagnan throws himself between the two twins and hurls
Louis backwards then spins to Phillippe

DARTAGNAN
Phillippe

PHILLIPPE
I am unhurt --

Louis bounces off the wall and thrusts back again driving
the blade into dArtagnans back

DArtagnans face jolts he staggers his legs buckle
DArtagnan falls into the arms of his friends

Louis stands holding his bloody dagger everyone staring at
him dArtagnan the old Musketeers the young ones

PHILLIPPE
You Vicious evil

He leaps into Louis overwhelming him in fury wrenching the
dagger from his brothers hand and gripping his throat

DARTAGNAN
Phillippe No Dont He is
your brother

Phillippe releases Louis who falls choking gasping
Lieutenant Andre is surprised by what he just heard

LIEUTENANT
Brother

Phillippe darts to dArtagnan being cradled by Athos Athos
lifts a hand from dArtagnans back it is drenched in blood
DArtagnan is dying

Athos Aramis Porthos none of them can speak They grip
dArtagnan as if through their will alone they could keep
his life from leaking away The young Musketeers stand
transfixed watching their legendary Captain die Phillippe
sags his voice from behind the iron mask is torn by grief

PHILLIPPE
All this time I was a lost
secret But you were hiding all
your loyalty all your love You
were the Man in the Iron Mask
ATHOS
DArtagnan

DARTAGNAN
Shhh All my life this is the
death I have wanted To die among
you One for all and all for

He is gone

Phillippe rises with a slow terrible resolve and moves to
Louis When Louis tries to rise to his feet he finds the
blade of the young Lieutenant Andre pointed at his chest

LIEUTENANT
All my life all I ever wanted to
be was him

He points to dArtagnan Phillippe rips away the key that
dangles around Louis neck

CUT TO
AT THE OTHER DOOR

where the soldiers of the BASTILLES COMMANDER are finally
breaking through working the massive door aside they find --

THE KING with his guards and Aramis Athos Porthos along
with their prisoner in the Iron Mask

LIEUTENANT
We have recaptured the prisoner

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
No no I am your --

A blow in his chest from the Lieutenant stuns the prisoner
and drops him to his knees The King orders the BASTILLE
GOVERNOR --

KING
You will put this madman where no
one can hear his insanity Let him
be fed by a deaf mute But feed him
well and let him have a long life
within the Iron Mask
BASTILLE GOVERNOR
And them

He means Aramis Porthos and Athos

KING
They are my loyal servants

MAN IN THE IRON MASK
No No

But the guards are dragging him to the deepest darkest
dungeon of the Bastille

DISSOLVE TO
EXT LANE OF ELMS - BESIDE THE PALACE - DAY

At the end of a lane of elms where the markers of kings
graves stand clustered royal workmen place a mighty marble
monument stone above the final resting place of dArtagnan

Athos Aramis Porthos and the King -- Phillippe known as
King Louis now -- stand gathered there as Aramis in his
priests garments utters the funeral incantations Aramis
voice breaks as he does so Porthos eyes pour out rivers of
tears Athos grief is beyond weeping

Phillippe holds the arm of his mother She holds the rose
dArtagnan left her

ARAMIS
Amen

Athos moves up between Aramis and Porthos and links them
with his arms

ATHOS
He was the best of us all

Aramis and Porthos move off together to walk the lane of
elms Athos remains by the grave unable to leave

Phillippe pats Annes arm
PHILLIPPE

I will be with you in a moment
Mother
She too moves down the lane of trees touching the tip of the
rose pedals to her lips as the tears run down her face

Phillippe moves up to Athos

PHILLIPPE
After all you have done I must ask
you one more service to your king
I have lost my father And you have
lost your son Let me love you like
a son to a father And I pray you

live for this to love me like your
son

Athos cant speak he can only nod yes Phillippe moves to
join his mother leaving Athos to take one final look down at
the grave Then as Athos moves off to join Aramis and
Porthos we PAN from the name DARTAGNAN on the stone to
the pattern chiseled beneath the name

It is a mask of iron

FADE OUT
