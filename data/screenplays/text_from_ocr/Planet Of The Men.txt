PLANET OF THE MEN
(A sequcl to Planet of The Apes)

Final scene from the first fiim Taylor is in front of
the Statue of Liberty in a state of violent despair Nova
watches him apprehensively then plucking up courage she
touches his shoulder her eyes questioning him mutecly -

TAYLOR

And I believed that I had discovered
anew world This is Earth nothing
more than Earth

Exasperated by Novas air of bewilderment Taylor shakes
ger by the shoulders and points howling towards the
tatue -

The Earth Cant you understand that
all these things could only have
happened on Earth

Nova is badly frightened by Taylors outburst and recoils
from him with a defensive gesture Taylor controls himself
and slightly calmer he shrugs his shoulders and strokes
her hair -

TAYLOR (despondently)

No You dont understand You cant
begin to understand You know nothing

Nova makes a sketchy attempt to smile then suddenly
stiffens her head She listens indicating the surrounding
forest There is a cracking of twigs and before long some
figures emerge through the trees

They are humans They move furtively in leaps and bounds
from thicket to thicket and come nearer little by little
The fears of daius had sone
foundations after all This
junsie tis also inhabited
inhabited by men

He takes a long look around and adds in tones of
derision

Men The creatures of our species
Novai Wot the smallest spari of light
in their eyes Heads that have becone
amass of unconscious molecules

Each time he speaks the nuaans retreat slishtly Then
they advance a little nearer and the citcle narrows around
Taylor and Nova She is beconing nervous

Stop

The men pause momentarily Then -they continue to nove
furtively without walkinz towards Taylor dircetly Singly
their leans appear to have no purpose but the gathering

is generally moving towarcs Taylor It is obvious that

the sound of his voice is causing a feverisin excitencnt
Taylor shaies his rifle and speaks roughly

TAYLOR
I said Stop Stay where you are
An I going to have to ari myself against
my fellow men

Another hesitation then a fresh advance Which looks
ominous Taylor starts to raise nis rifle At that
monent there is a terrific noise of breaking branches and
a wild buffalo enerses from a thicket ana charges towards
the group In the twinkling of an eye everyone rushes
towards the trees and clinbs cut of reach

However one of the women who carries a baby in her arus
is unable to get out of the way of the charging beast
Taylor who has stayed with his gun levelled fires
The burfalo flounders and rolls to the ground Taylor
has shot him in the head The buffalo is still

A long silent scene the woman with the baby stares
intensely at Taylor then at the dew beast The sien
perched in the trees do the sainc A few to start with
then all tozether they decide to climb down

Taylor is now resting on his rifle and waiting in an
attitude of hope

The woman places her baby at the foot of a tree turne
towards Taylor and throws herself face-downvards in front
of him her head in the dust like a grovelling dog

Some of the men follow suit until soon all are prostrate
in froat of Taylor who watches their antics with an
intense curiosity Taylor looks up to the sky as if he
has discovered a lignt His mood of dejection and despair
Slowly lifts

TAYLOR
Perhaps all is not lost
He looks into Novas eyes and smiles She holds his gaz
and in turn tries to siile But her features contract
and her smile quickly changes into a grimace of pain She
pales is shaken by a spasin and also falls to the ground
TAYLOR
Not you

He wants to force her to her fect but realises tnat she
is ill

TAYLOR

But you are unwell ‘What is the
matter

Nova recovers tries to smile again straightens with an
effort points towards the baby at the foot of the tree then
towards her own stomach
TAYLOR
You want to say that a child
(his voien grows steadily more iiapassioned)

A child a son ason
and this you understand

Nova intensifies her grimnaces which becoue more and more
like a human smile For the first time a light of
intelligence shovs in her eyes Taylor straightens he
has reached the height of excitement

TAYLOR

No all is not lost This is a sign from
the sky I dont know what devil has
amused himself by reversing the laws

of nature on this Planet but here there
is a great mission to accomplish

He turns in the direction of the City of Apes
TAYLOR

Zaius I take an oath you will hear
more of me Even if it takes my entire
life I swear that one dey you will

know real men to both of us Zaius

A fairly long silence Taylor contemplates the men prostrate
before hin and presently addresses thea

TAYLOR

Men real men I swear it Listen to
fe you others ‘ie have a long way

to go together a terrible height to
recover ‘Je have already taken the
first steps to-day and now to
start with (shouting) Get yourselves
orf the ground

Stand un

The men take fright and dont move Taylor goes to the
woman with the baby takes her hand and forces her to get
up Slowly one after the other the men lift their heads
and straighten up They avoid Taylors stare He seizes
one of them bodily and forces him to look him in the cye

TAYLOR
Stand up all of you and look at
me Wen have to hold thenselves

upright and look each other in the
eye

poe aaa

Four years later in the City of Apes Zaius office daius
is closeted with one of his orang-outan colleagues
Maximus Sounds are heard from outside as if slogans are
being chanted by large crowds

MAXTEUS

These sort of demonstrations are going
to undermine our rule

ZAIUS (morosely)

I kmow that

MAXINUS
These young intellectual chiapanzees are
umsupportable This is a rebellion
which could establish itself ‘Were
going to haveto do something about it

ZAIUS (pensively)

Yes we have to do something

Outside the noise increases Zaius goes to the window and
lifting a corner of the curtain looks out

Long distance view of street demonstrations A long
procession of apes and brandishing placards

A closer view of a group shovs that they are all young
chimpanzees The slogans are clear and one can read the
various placards Release Zira and Cornelius Down
with Tyranny For a Free Science -

At the head of this group young Lucius is recognisable
he gives a signal

Zaius lets the curtain fall and steps aside from the window
MAXTiUS

Ths situation has done nothing but
deteriorate over tne last four years
Ever since the appearance of that man
Taylor -

ZATUS
That monster with a human face and
the language of apes who has caused
grave defection amongst weak spirits
like Zira and Cornelius Their arrest
hasnt done any good Its the
nephew of Zira that imbecile Lucius
who now propogates heresies and madness

“thy dont you have him arrested too
ZALUS

They would find another to take his
place

Uproar grows outside Zaius and Maximus look out of the
Window again A group of iiounted gorilla police are in
the middle of charging the demonstrators

MATS

Brave gorillas Happily they keep
a cool head They are completely
loyal

ZAIUS

Loyal and stupid Their truncheon

blows only end by provoking more

riots which recommence within the
our
MAXTiUS
So
ZATUS
So I have decided to change my
tactics to provisionally
maxe things peaceful I Am having
Zira and Cornelius brought here
MAXXIS
Youre going to free them
ZAIUS
I would have done that a long time
ago if they had asreed to make a
public admission of their errors
MAXTUS
And they refused
ZAIUS (enraged)

Does that surprise you You still
dont understand intellectuals

HAXILUS
And to-day

ZAIUS
‘Ie will see I have decided to show
them the velvet glove It is the

only way to get the population back
under control

Zalus rings a bell

Presently Zira and Cornelius appear

escorted oy two gorillas Ata sign froia Gaius the
gorillas retire There 1s a silence during which fresh
disturbances are heard from outside
ZAIUS
T hope you are both satisfied with
the result of your tifeories We
are on the brink of a revolution

ZIRA

Scientific theories have never been

the cause of revolution Dr caius

The real provocations are totalitarianism
and unjustified repression

Zaius shrugs his shoulders and adopts a concilliatory tone
ZAIUS

We wont go into that What is past

is past I have brought you here to
give you some good news I am prepared
to release you immediately on the
condition

ZIRA

A condition that we find unacceptable
You have already made sour terns
clear

24 TUS

At least wait to hear what I an

proposing ‘“o you to-cay

br Cornelius you are a reasonable ro
ape and a young intellectual with a bryllen

future ahead of you for whicn I have

high hopes putting aside a few

points over which we differ You

cannot mean to spend the rest of your

life in prison out of sheer stubbornness

CORSELIUS
You may call it stubbornness I call

it my professional integrity I cannot
agree to any denials
ZAIUS

Who said anything about denials
Ian only asking you to keep quiet

Z2IRA

Only To silence the graatest
scientific discovery of our time
Ansver his Cornelius

Cornelius is silent deep in thought The moment he opens
his mouth Zaius cuts in

ZAIUS

Tnere are many other worthwhile
discoveries for an intellectual

such as yourself to make Dr Cornelius
Let me repeat that you may think as

you like It makes no difference to

me Believe your own theories if you
Wish after all isnt that

the basis of all true science to be
scientifically impartial But we must
hear no more talk about this man this
monster in our City of Apes lheep
quiet and the people will forget Believe
me it is in everyones interest

CORVELIUS
Then may I ask you Dr Zaius if you
yourself have really forgotten him Can
I ask you if you have not thought about
him during toe last four years
ZATUS
I have
He is silent for a morient and then speaks in a grave voice
ZAIUS
I have thought about him and I have

no intention of concealing anything
from you to-day On the contrary he
- 10 -

has been brought to my notice

and in a way that I hope will give
you something to think about - as

it would to any reasonable ape who
pelleves in the ruture of the simian
yaée Sit dowa br Coraclius and
you Zira I an goins to show you
everything ‘dhen you know what has
happened over there in the forbidcen
zone the jungle where he lives I am
sure you will be as convinced as I am
that all apes should stay united
one day we ilay all have to face up to
a mortal threat to our race Give me
the dossier Dr iaximus

CORNELIUS

What is it about
Reports received from ny agents
concerning the activities in the
forbidden zone

Zima (scornfully)
You mean your spies

ZATUS
If you prefer read this

Zira and Cornelius bend over a lengthy document Cornelius
reads in a loud voice

CORMMLIUS

Report from the chief of the hunter
gorillas

ZAIUS

He is not a spy as you insinuated

It was after receiving his report that
I attempted to keep better informed

of the situation
- ll -

CORNELIUS (reading)

On finding signs of several large
troups of humans beyoyd the Torbidden
gone we deciced to wake an exception
and take a raiding party over there
Authorisation was asked for and given
by the Chief Council

ZIRA (interrupting)

Given because you hoped that Taylor
woulda be killed during the raid isnt
that so Dr Zaius

Zaius shrugs his shoulders and doesnt reply Cornelius
continues

CORNELIUS (reading)

The raid was being prepared with care
by our best hunters A group of hunans
had been found and surrounded But when
the Beaters started to sound their gongs
instead of rushing in panic as usual
towards the hunters ang the waiting nets
that day the men

Direct view of the raid

Along the forest border a line of gorillas on horseback
are secn they are waiting for the gane

The beaters are seen waking a terrific uproar in the forest
Some brandish clubs the others ring gongs All of then
are screaming and howling They have no firearms

Between the hunters and the beaters are a group of men
At the first sound of the gongs they start to run panic-
stricken from the uproar towards the line of hunters
Then Taylors furious voice is heard
- 12 «

TAYLOR
Stop Come this way

He 4s seen armed with his rifle barring the way of the
running fugitives He waves them impressively tovards
the direction of the noise Nova stays near hin carrying
a baby in her aris

TAYLOR

This way These ones are not
armed

The fugitives hesitate then stop and gather round hin
Taylor starts to walk towards the beaters liova follows
him unquestioningly After some hesitation the men follow
too

TAYLOR (emphasizing his words
with gestures)

Follow behind me And get in order
We are not a herd of cattle

A shot of the mounted hunters waiting slightly puzzled
for the gamc that doesnt appear

A procession of men march hehind Taylor Their apyearance
forming a complete contrast to the panic-driven troup of
previous occasions They walk together tvo or three
bbreast

It is noticeable that some mostly the very young who are
hardly iiore than children pick up sticks and copy Taylors
way of brandishing or carrying his rifle on his shoulder
The uproar of zonss and yells get nearer It is obvious
that many are uneasy out they all continue to march forward
with their eyes fixed on Taylor

a shot of the line of beaters then the meeting of the

two groups The beaters give their favourite war-cries
shaking their clubs Taylor stops calmly in front of them
and leans on his rifle At the sight of the gorillas soe
of the men make a move to run

TAYLOR (yelling)

Stop Stay where you ara
- 13 -

The men obey him Nova tightens her grip on the baby
she holds in her arms The young men carrying sticks
are leaning on them as Taylor does with his rifle

A fresh shot of the beaters shocked by this unexpected
reaction Their stupification is revealed throush the
gradual weakening of their gong-beats Finally the
uproar subsides into a near total silence broken by an
occasional gong-beat each more timed than the last

Another shot of the mounted hunters on the edge of the
forest They are straining their ears and listening in
amazenent to the decrease and final ending of the noise

A Hunter Gorilla
‘that the hell are they doing

A new shot of the two groups beaters and humans face to
face The silence is complete Taylor indicates the borders
of the forest with his rifle and speaks to the beaters

TAYLOR

This is my ‘kingdom I intend to be
left in peace me and fly people I
also intend that in future no-one
is going to distur our country with
this ridiculous yelling and screaming
Is that understood

An astonished silence from the apes Taylor heckons his
men and followed by then crosses tne line of baaters One
of them an enormous gorilla makes a protest and lifts his
club against a man Taylor brinzs up nis rifle and shoots
The apes arm falls to his side inert

TAYLOR

The next time Ill blow your fithy
ape-head off Drop all your cudzgels

He raises his rifle The young men follow suit with their
sticks The apes panic drop their cudgels and gongs and
start to run in disorder towards their horsemen

Nova still holding her baby picks uv one of the gongs
and looks at it curiously She gives it a few awiward and
timid bangs The baby laugns so does Nova and starts

to hit the gong harder
-14-

The youngest boys pick up all the remaining gongs and
copy Nova The last apes rush away terrified At the
sight of them Taylor explodes with laughter

New shot of the horsemen ready for their catch They
hear the sound of the gongs begin again

One Hunter Gorilla
At last theyre getting on with it
About time too
Another

The game wont be long now

Another
Here they come
Terrific noise from the forest All the hunters get their
guns ready and the troup of beaters emerge in a
state of complete panic
A beater

The-man-who-talks the man who
talks is there

The hunters are furious and start raining blows down on
the beaters

At the City of Apes In Zaius office Cornelius is
finishing the report

CORNELIUS (reading)

We came back empty-handed that day
and with one of our beaters wounded

ZAIUS

Id like to bring your attention to
one particular point Dr Cornelius
The woman who followed Taylor was
recognised by one of the beaters It
- 15 -

was the same one who was in
Taylors cage and who went with
him when he escaped Now this
woman carried a baby in her arns
(a pause) Are you beginning to
understand why I consider it a duty
to keep informed of all that is
happening over there

ZIRA

I certainly dont regret that the
hunters returned empty-handed
These raids are always cruel

ZAIUS

And on which subjects are we going

to be able to continue our experiments
How is your medical science going to
progress Dr Zira if men are not
going to let us capture them

Zira shrugs her shoulders without replying Zaius shows
Cornelius another report

ZAIUS

Read this one It is particularly
interesting It was made by one of

my most conpetent agents a chimpanzee
I trust you will not doubt his word

CORNELIUS (reading)

Having passed into the Forbidden Zone
by the evening I reached an area

which bore signs of human occupation
After nightfall I penetrated deeper
into the forest The moon lit ny path
Presently I noticed a strange smell
and I noticed a light through the trees
I crawled towards it It was then that
I witnessed the most amazing sight
- Lo «

Actual shot of the chimpanzee crawling in the forest
towards the light he sees through the trees He soon
comes to a vast clearing well lit by the moon and at
the same time one sees the following scene-

Taylor is in the centre of a circle of men wonen and
children all squatting or reclining on the ground ifova
is next to him By her side is their son SIRIUS who is
now about two years old Taylor is holding a flaning
branch in his hand and is lighting a pile of wood with it
The bon-fire begins to catch light

The flames reach higher illuminating the surrounding
hunans Its obvious that many of them are experiencing
sharp pangs of fear Some avert their eyes and even hide
thelr faces Some others start to run towards the forest
Once again Taylors commanding tones ring out

TAYLOR
Stop Stay where you are

They stop instantly It is apparent that they have become
used to obeying this order

TAYLOR

Watch Men must not be afraid
of fire

He pokes the fire Baby Sirius leaves Nova and zocs to
Taylor who shakes a small burning twig in front of his
face Sirius laughs He grabs a stick himself and waves
it about Hesitatingly Nova goes up and does the same
Taylor bursts out laughing

The children and the very young men in the company draw
slowly closer whilst the more adult stay where they are
Taylor watches tnem as he plays with his son who he has
taken in his arms
TAYLOR
Fire Fire Fire This is fire

Sirius repeats after him burbling at first but then
sounding clearer
- 17 -

sInIus
Fire fire Mire

HOVA (‘she attempts to imitate her son)
Fi Faire Fire

She laughs Taylor turns and speaks to the gathering He
raises his voice and points to his mouth

TAYLOR
Fire Fire FIRS

First the children then the others try to repeat this
together In the end their murmurings become stronger and
their volces ring out over the forest with crowing
enthusiasm

The Company
Fire Fire Fire FIRE

At the same time the children and the young men becone
more courageous and draw closer to the fire In the end
they each take a lighted sticx like Sirius and waving
them they inprovise a sort of dance

Cornelius finishes his recitation in Zaius office
COREALIUS (reading)

That is what I saw over the
border of the Forbidden Zone Men
who did not run away from fire who
were able to articulate a word and
the children of men wno danced rowmid
a fire exactly lixe the cnildren of
apes TI couldnt bear to watch the
scene any longer and I finally took
to my heels
ZAIUS

There you are And you can read

more recent reports They point

to many fresh disturbinz occurrences
Are yow not convinced yet that a

threat is building against the simian
race Do you believe we should wait

for the day when our rule and even

our existence may have to be defended
Do you now think it is a good idea to
spread your theories amongst the people
They can only breed trouble and disorder
I am appealing to your conscience as an
ape Dr Cornelius

Cornelius bends his head wordlessly Zira shrugs her
shoulders furiously

ZAIUS

I have faith in you You are both
free I am sure that you have understood

Ten years later Shot of the amphitheatre in the City of
Apes (p 58 of the script Planet of the Apes) ‘The
atmosphere is reminiscent of a political election which

is precisely wnat is happening They are holding an
election for the hnishest post that of The Minster of
Scicnce Cornelius has had the audacity to set himself us
as opposition candidate to JZaius

The slogans marked on the pennants strung across the
amphitheatre read as follows Vote for Cornelius Science
Knows No Limits Immediate Investigation Of The ihman
Conditions Peaceful Co-Bxistence Between Apes and Men
Cornelius Must Lead Apes and Science

The attendance is pretty sparse the majority being
chimpanzees there is an odd gorilla here and there and a
lot of empty benches

Cornelius is standing on the platform giving a speech
éZira and Lucius are sttting on either side of him
- 19 -

CORUBLIUS

» » For ten years I have kept

silent But to-caywhen my opponents
have started a campaign which can only
lead to a bloody war I believe it to

be my duty to speak with one adm in
mind which is to solicit your support
to oppose this terrible manocuvre It
goes without saying that all apes are
brothers and this is always in the
forefront of my mind (clapping from all
the benches) All apes are brothers
but that is no reason to massacre hwnans
en also have a right to live

A few enthusiastic claps from some chinlpanzees and murmurs
of disapproval from the few gorillas

CORNELIUS

« « » And I will go further We

should without prejudice stretch out
our hands to the humans and help then

to better their miserable condition

It would be a task worthy of apes and
if you give me your trust - if you elect
me as your winister of Science - here in
a phraseis wnat my aim will be

Peace and friendship with iien

The chimpanzecs applaud again but very half-heartedly

The gorillas are dissenting and muttering ansrily amongst
themselves Cornelius leaves the platform and talks to sone
of the chinpanzees in the front benches Other discussions
are going on around the room Snatches of converstaton

are heard

AChinpanzee

All the same hes going a bit too
far Friendship with men Give
them a hand indeed

A Gorilla

Its disgusting He shouldnt be
allowed to speak
- 20 «

Zira moves over to Lucius and talks to him in a low voice
ZIRA

Is this the crowd you hoped to
gather I dont see anyone here
apart from a few of our friends
and one can hardly say that they are
very enthusiastic

LUCIUS
Everything has collapsed That old
eharlatan caius has manoeuvred the
situation with diabolical cunning
The tine for revolution was ten years
ago when you were in prison Then
you were martyrs and I could have
found an army of young apes ready to
overthrow Gaius Since then patiently
and little by little he has broken
the spirit of revolt He has been
broadcasting everywnere how he is for
freedom of thought Ife took some
ostensibly liberal measures He has
given a few honorary posts to one or
two chinpanzces and as they grew
Older my friends allowad themselves
to be appeased The height of his
hypocritical talent is to have allowed
Cornelius to take part in the elections
There is no doubt what the result will
be

ZIRA

Dont you think Cornelius has the slightest
chance of being elected

LUCIUS
None

ZIRA
80
LUCIUS

So war will be declared against

the humans dZaius has been secretly
preparing public opinion over the
last ten years To-day he will have
achieved his wish Look

He points to the almost deserted amphitheatre Cornelius
is alone and the last of his audience hurry through the
exits

The same amphitheatre a few days later another political
meeting is under way this time Zaius is giving his spcech
Assembled rourid him on the platform are Maximus and other
orang-outan colleagues

The audience is far larger and more vociferous than
Cornelius crowd It is evening and the crowd is seen cinly
However the platform of aGarius is floodlit - only the first
few rows are clearly seen and they are filled with a
majority of gorillas and orang-outans

The pennants are far larger and brighter also more nuticrous
than those of the first meeting They read The Planet of
the Apes Belongs to the Apes Humans are Beasts They
Should be Caged Vote for Zaius the Only One Who Can Save
Our Race The Human Nace Must Disappear etc

Zalus speaks solemnly His speech is frequently interrupted
by applause

ZAIUS

Allow an old ape to talk to you
one who has been your Minister of
Science for years now and who asks
for your support again to-day
because he believes it to be his
duty (clapping) Allow me to
tell you to-day the whole truth
without glossing over the danger
which threatens us as some of my
Opponents have done
Thunderous applause Cries of Death to Cornelius
Zaius smiles indulgently and after a moment raises his
arms for silence

ZAIUS

The truth can be expressed in
one sentence A threat of
extinction menaces the Simian
Race You know the cause of this
A monster spewed up from Hell has
appeared on our planet A man
certainly nothinz more than a man
I assert one more time that true
science has proved this fact (clapping)
Only a man my friends but this man
is danzerous ‘This man has managed
to imitate some of our actions By
some freak of nature extraordinary
but not inexplicable he is able to
speak a few words He has got hold of
a rifle and learnt how to use it
Another instance of straishtforward
mechanical imitation a charicature of
our genius I dont nced to
denounce the elucidations of a few
pseudo wen of science who believe
that these are signs of a hidden
conscience (sarcastic laushter and clapping) These
are Obvious exaiuples of the humans
highly developed imitative instinct
But this man relatively superior in
comparison to his fellows has managed
to make the others obcy hin and is
inspiring them to hate our race

A Voice fro the Crowd

How can he inspire them if they have
no soul

Iuttering and grumbling in the audience Two gorillas in
charge start towards the heckler It is Lucius lost in

the crowd Zira is by his side Zaius interrupts with a

hypocritical smile and gestures the two gorillas away
I beg my young heckler to let me
continue ‘When I have finished

I will be happy to listen to any
arguments he has to offer Everyone
here knows how I have always championed
the right of free speech

ZIRA (in an undertone)

Liar

ZAIUS (when things have settled down)

This man has installed himself beyond
the borders of the Forbidden Zone

We have to aduit to-day that there are
more humans over there than we
previously thought He is preaching
revolution azainst us the apes - I
have evidence from a reliable source
Thereforé even tomorrow if we do not
prepare ourselves we could find our
country invaded by these bestial
creatures with no reason in their
heads but with nearts full of hate
It is a human tide which coucs to
submerge us and hich would be the
end of all civilisation on this planet
This is what awaits us

Uproar shouts of indignation that Zaius stills with a
gesture before continuing

ZAIUS

Furthermore the situation is perhaps
even blacker than I have indtcated

In days gone by I was well-informed of
this mans conduct For many months
in fact for some years now none of ny
agents have been able to enter the area
he considers as his kingdom He has
posted sentries who watch the border
day and night Why I ask you
Why if he is not preparing his
2h o
(Zaius cont )

army of blood-thirsty beasts for
the purpose of launching an attack
on our city

Fresh uproar and shouts of consternation

Amongst the men The peaceful atmosphere makes a complete
contrast to the picture invoked by Zaius

Taylor is ploughing a field to show a group of three men
what they have to do He handles the sort of rough wooden
cart still found in many countries The cart is pulled

by a buffalo The harness is made from vines and picces
of wood A small area of the field has already been
tilled

At the end of the field is a strange looking village
composed of huts made out of branches and clay and with
thatched roofs
Sitting in front of ‘one of the huts “is Novaawatching the
ploughing with interest Neither she nor Taylor secm to
have been affected by the thirtcen or fourteen years that
have passed since the beginning
Taylor stops the buffalo and speaks to one of the men
TAYLOR
Its your turn now Gee

The buffalo becomes unharnessed The man was going too
fast

TAYLOR

Stop I told you that you must
press hard with your arms like this

The man tries again a little less awkwardly He manages
to make a rather crooked furrow Taylor who is standing
near the other two men talks to one of them
TAYLOR

I dont see your son John TI
told him to cowe for his lessdn

The Man (speaking with difficulty)
Son John

TAYLOR
I said Where is he

The Han
John there

The man waves his arm in the direction of the forest

TAYLOR (with impatience)

Where TI said wheye You must
speak Do you hear Speak

The Man (with an effort)

In the cave

TAYLOR

That lazy bones I am going to
box his ears

He walks a few stops towards the forest changes nis mind
and calls out -

TAYLOR
Sirius

NOVA (sitting in front of the hut)
Sirius Sirius
Her speech is laboured but far better than that of the
men tilling the field

Long shot of Sirius who sucdenly appears on the threshold
of the hut He is a boy of thirteen who looks mature for
his age He is a handsome lad who radiates health and
energy his face is alert and intelligent ihen he appears
Nova looks at him with delight
Sirius speaks quite normally

SIRIUS

Did you call for me mother

NOVA
Your father is calling you

SIRIUS

Do you want me dad

TAYLOR

You can come and take over this
instruction for me The adults are
hard-headed far nore so than the
young ones but little by little
the idea gets through

SIRIUS

Alright father

(to the labourer) You youve
been told to press hard down
and to walk straight good Lord

Yow furrow is as twisted as a monkeys
leg Now watch

He demonstrates making a perfect furrow Taylor has
returned to the hut for a moment and puts his arms round
Nova They both watch their son with tenderness and pride
- 27

TAYLOR
Ill be back in less than an hour
Nova nods her head showing that she has understood
TAYLOR
You havent asked me where Im going
You must talk to me talk
HOVA

Where are you going

TAYLOR
To punish a lazy boy who is playing
truant from school

NOVA (uncomprehending)
School playing truant

TAYLOR
He has taken a walk to avoid
working He deserves to be taught
a lesson understand
NOVA (smiling)
Nova has understood Nova does not
play truant from school - she doesnt
deserve to be taught a lesson
TAYLOR
Well done

He kisses her and disappears into the forest whilst Sirius
continues to watch the ploughing

Shot of Taylor in the forest He reaches the entrance
of a sort of cave a narrow hole in the rocks He notices
naked footprints on the sandy surface

TAYLOR

He is woll off here always
ready to hide away when theres
a job to do Thats typical of
a man

He passes into the srotto and walks down a dim and narrow
passage The passage opens out into a large underground
room rather reminiscent of some of our prehistoric caves
Piles of rock and stalactites and stalaguites

At the end of the room between two needle-like rocks a
light can be seen which increases as Taylor gets nearer
and which makes the stalactites sparkle

TAYLOR (in a hushed voice)

What on earth can he be doing in
there

He continues to walk carefully The scene at the end of

the room becomes clearer little by little within the circle
of one brilliant light - in contrast with the rest of the
cave The illumination comes from a great many Little

balls of lighted resin which are stuck in the cracks all
over the rock The end of the room is evocative of a church
or temple altar where a religious ceremony is about to

take place

As if to confirm this impression the back of a man 4s scen
he is facing the wall and in the setting loolss like some
kind of priest His movenents are slow and mcasured and

he applies himself to his strange work with intense
concentration

One finally sees that the man (very young fifteen or
sixteen years old) is painting A bold design alrendy
forms part of the mural a design which could be buffalo
or deer-hunting by a group of men armed with bows and
arrows This wall painting resembles those in our
prehistoric caves The drawing (in chalk or charcoal) is
finished The man is in the middle of colouring the
picture Near his feet is a stone melting pot containing
yellow clay which he is applying to the wall with a large
wooden tool

The young man is so deeply absorbed in his work thal he
doesnt hear Taylor arrive Taylor has stopped a few
feet behind him and visibly shaken with emotion He
finally speaks in strangled tones

TAYLOR
Art Art This is Art
The young man turns with a start He looks like a guilty
child caught in the act who tries to avoid being smacked
Taylor gives a shout of joy
TAYLOR
Weve made it Victory Victory

He rushes to the youngster and clasps him in his arms

In the amphitheatre of the apes Zaius 1s finishing his
election speech

ZATUS

e » To conclude before the bestial
instincts which threaten our civilisation
are unleashed I say it would be criminal
not to defend ourselves «and I also say
that the best method of defence in a case
like this is to attack (violent applause)
Now you know my plans It is so that

I may perform this public service that

I ask you to vote for me

Zaius sits down in a thunder of applause Lucius is seen
climbing ontc a bench and shouting
- 30

LUCIUS

I have something to say

Voices
Out Out A chimpanzee has no
right to be here
ZAIUS (smiling)
My young heckler may have his say
We are not afraid of arguments here
LUCTUS
I have to say that humans are not

An outburst of shouting and whistling Some gorillas rush
towards Lucius and he is thrown out of the amphitheatre

ZAIUS (simply)

Of course I never doubted it

Another Orang-Outan
What steps are you going to take
Dr Zaius to carry out your
prograzane

ZAIUS

I am meeting the head of our arny
this evening - Field Marshall Urus
The measures to be taken are his
province

Cheering is taking place outside and is seen fron the
square under Zaius windows

Various Shouts

Long live Urus Long live the army
Long live Zaius

Field Marshall Urus arrives in the square It is possible
to distinguish this enormous gorilla from a distance with
his uniform covered with various decorations and awards
He is on horseback foliowed by various body-guards and
other gorillas on horseback The small group clear a
passage for themselves up to Zaius door greeted by
frantic cheering all the way A crowd of apes are
gathered in the square where loudspeakers are broad-
casting the election results

Fleld Marshal Urus dismounts attended by one of his
soldiers and disappears into Zalus block

In one corner of the square Zira Cornelius and Lucius
have been watching the Field Marshals arrival

CORNELIUS (heatedly)
Zaius hasnt lost much time Even
before the final results are
through hes called in the army
ZIRA
It will mean the extermination of
men
CORMELIUS
Of the majority certainly of
Taylor the most important The
rest will return to their animal
state or end up in our cages
LUCIUS
It is pure genocide a crime against
against humanity
CORMSLIUS

You said ‘humanity Just like Taylor

ZIRA
This crime has to be stopped

CORNELIUS

I did all that I could to oppose
Zaius Apart from a few chimpanzees
I have no following
- 33 «

ZIRA

Then Taylor must be warned what
ds being plotted against him and
his people

CORNELIUS (after a pause)

As Zaius is going to declare a
state of war that would be an
act of treason

Zira is about to reply when her voice is drowned by the
loudspeakers

The Radio

Final and total results of all
sections Population 73192
Voters 65 294

Dr Zaius has 61123 votes

Dr Cornelius 4171 votes

Dr Zaius is elected

The last words are drowned by the shouts of the crowd who
start chanting

The Crowd
We want Zaius We want Zaius

The windows of Zaius office open The balcony is
suddenly illuminated by floodlights Zaius appears
singly in front of a sinall group the three orans-utans
and the Field Marshal are slightly behind him Then
Zalus turns beckons to Urus who comes and stands by his
side Gaius shakes his hand with great ostentation this
causes extra cheering from the crowd

Shot of the three chimpanzees in shadow in the square
LUCIUS (soberly)
Strength allied with tyranny and
injustice If it is a treasonable

act Cornelius I am prepared to
commit it I am going to warn Taylor
- 3 -

I am going with you

CORNELIUS (after a hesitation)

You are both mad but Im
coming too

Zira rushes into his arms whilst the noise about them
gradually abates

Fast moving view of the three apes travelling Cornelius
and Zira in a chariot Lucius on horseback They pass in
front of the scare-crow figures
ZIRA (to Cornelius)
We are entering the Forbidden Zones
Are you sure of what youre doing
There is still time to turn back
CORNELIUS

And you

ZIRA

Iam only risking my freedom
perhaps my life But you you are
sacrificing a great career

CORMELTUS

I am with you and with the spirit
of scientific exploration and discovery
What did you imagine I am dying to
see with my own eyes the amazing sights
that Zaius agents have reported

want to know exactly what that man has
been able to take on over there and

(cont )
(Cornelius cont)

how successful he has been
Sometimes I think the whole thing
is a dream

Ss

IRA

Is that your only reason
Scientific curiosity

CORNELIUS

You know very well that it isnt
Its plain you are never going to
allow me to stay neutral in this
matter

They are passing through the Forbidden Zone They pass
in front of the cave that Zaiug had blocked by blowing
up the entrance They then follow the sate path along
the beach which Taylor and Nova take in the final scenes
of the first film

When they come near to the spot where Taylor discovers

the Statue of Liberty they hear sounds of noisy confusion
which is soon dominated by Taylors authoritative voice
The three chimpanzees stop and listen

ZIRA
Its him

The three chimpanzees continue on foot until they come
in sight of the Statue They stop in their tracks
paralysed with shock

The Statue of Liberty is and the centre of a great hive
of activity Taylor has taken it into his head to raise
the Statue back upright

On the side that the Statue is leaning tree trunks are
being used to prop her up On different levels of an
immense wooden scaffolding a team is seen to be levering
- 36 -

and shifting tree-trunks to stralghten the Statue
little by little For the same purpose on the other
side about a hundred men are pulling on a rope made of
plaited vines lashed around the Statue On this side
a trench has been dug to make the work easier

Taylor is perched on tho top of one set of scaffolding
and directs the proceedings instructing and gesticulating

TAYLOR

A bit more Heave-ho
Heave-ho Easy
Stop Stop

The Statue is a little straighter Taylor climbs quickly
down his scaffolding

Fresh shot of the three apes

A Commanding Voice (behind them)
Stop

The three chimpanzees turn their heads and find themselves
face to face with two young boys (13 to 15 years old)

One has an enormous bow and arrow aimed at them The
other carries a wooden spear at the point of which is a
sharpened stone Lucius makes a defensive move

Boy with the Row

Stop Stay where you are

He speaks slowly but auite distinctly (the phrase is
recognisable as one frequently used by taylor)

ZIRA
He talks

Shot of the working site The workers are sweating and
breathing heavily they are taking a rest and gazing at

the Statue They have not seen the apes neither has
Taylor who has now reached the ground He is giving orders
to a group of four men who are having difficulty lifting

a large stone plaque Taylor is showing them where he
wants it placed at the foot of the Statue
New shot of the three apes who are wary of their captors

Boy with Spear

What are you doing here This is
the country of men

LUCIUS

This one speaks too

CORNELIUS

And many others I am sure (softly)
Things move very fast

Boywith Spear

Apes are not allowed to enter the
country of men Get moving
straight ahead We go over there
the Man Who Speaks will decide your
punishment

With his spear he points to Taylor in the distance The
three apes walk towards the Statue Taylor is engrossed
in the placing of the plaque and doesnt hear thei

approach but groups of workersssee them and shrink away

with repugnance as they pass A general murmuring takes
place

Several Voices
Apes Apes no apes here

The plaque has been placed Taylor who is still unaware
of anything unusual steps back to see the effect By
now Zira is just behind him An inscription is seen
engraved on the plaque it is possible to read it as
Taylor himself recites in ringing tones (It is the
actual inscription that figures on the Statue of Liberty)
- 38

TAYLOR (reading)

Give me your tired your poor
Your huddled megses yearning to breathe fire

The wretched refuse of your t w teeming neshore
Send these the homeless tempest tossed 2d£O Mee

Zira has involuntarily read the last two lines with him
ZIRA
Very beautiful Who wrote that

TAYLOR

The poet Emma Lazarus a few million
years ago

He turns in utter amazement to see the apes
TAYLOR
Zirat And Cornelius and ny
young friend Lucius (to the sentries)

Lower your‘arms you two These are
friends

Boy with Bow
Apes Friends

TAYLOR

Friends Once they saved my life
It is thanks to them that I am
here

The two boys look astonished and a little crestfallen

They lower their weapons clasping them against their
chests

Boy with Bow

How can there be such a thing as
good ape

Mutters (from the crowd of workmen)

Friends Friends Friends with apes
- 39

TAYLOR (raising his voice)

Friends I forbid anyone to harm
them

The muttering dies down The two sentries go back to
their posts

TAYLOR (to the apes)
You must excuse them Its news to them
For a long time now no apes have dared
to come here To what do I owe the
pleasure of your visit
Zira is about to reply but Cornelius breaks in
CORIELIUS
Mostly curiosity but well talk
about that later First let me
congratulate you on the progress you
have made These men appear to
understand what you say
TAYLOR

They understand me

CORUELIUS
And they talk

TAYLOR
Especially the youngsters My best
results have been with the new
generation and I have great faith
in it

LUCIUS

That is certainiy evident
TAYLOR

Now I would like to offer you the
honours of the kingdom I have
created here - with the beings that
you consicer as animals Come

The tnree apes follow Taylor who takes them into the
forest Zira holds Cornelius back for a moment -

ZIRA
Why havent you let him know the
reason for our visit
Theres no hurry Id like to know

a little more about this strange
world where he seems to be king

Taylor walking ahead of the apes comes to a clearing
It is the village already seen alongside the plouzhed
field The hones are wooden huts cemented with clay

Tne roors are thatched The whole is primitive but very
clean The huts are well set out with small gardens full
of plants Sone old men are working in then

ZIRA
Did the saiwe en who used to live
in dens make this village

TAYLOR
The sane But you havent seen
anything yet This is only a
provisional centre We are in the
middle of making something far better

CORTELIUS (anxiously)

Far better
Ul «

TAYLOR

Shortly theyll be able to leave
these hovels and move into the new
city that we are building Come

Taylor takes then back into the forest They shortly

euerge into an enormous clearing aA party of men are

felling trees to enlarge it further They are hacking
away in an inexnerienced and clwasy fasnion but with

great enthusiasm Tne head of this working party is a
young boy between 13 and 15 years old

The first part of the clearing is covered with cultivated
vegetation

The woodiien are stupified to see the apes

The young overseer waves his axe in a menacing manner
Taylor intervenes

TAYLOR

These apes are my friends and my
guests

The Cverseer (sceandalised)
Yriends These apes

The wooden react in the sane way as the vorkmen on the
Statue site Novever they obey Parlor and carry 6n wlth
thelr work giving the apes occasional furtive zlances

TAYLOR (pointing to the cultivated
area)

Tnis area will be large enough for
our vegetables I have to cut
Gown part of the forest

LUCIUS (examining the tools)

Stone hatchets
TAYLOR

Yes stone Yor hunting arrows
tipped with stone ior fishing
hooxs of stone Our tools are still
in the Stone Ase But we are
prosressin frou stage to stage by
leaps and pounds Look at my
plantations

CORNELIUS

IT am looking

LUCIUS (ponderously)

Our evolution came to pass the day
the ape seized his destiny himself
with both hands

ZIRA
And where did you get the seeds fron

TAYLOR (laughing)

From you I make a good thief
We took some fron your fields in the
night

CORRLIUS (rather bitterly)

I dont doubt it And is that all
you have stolen

TAYLOR
- qr rs
Yes so far That was Se most vital
need agriculture is the beginning
of all civilization
N30 6
CORUSLIUS

And this is your awbition
To create a new civilization

Just that a civilization

They have walked across the fields They stop ona small
hill from where the lay-out of the cléaring can be scen

TAYLOR

At the moment this is my most

ambitious undertaking the future
city

Shot of then together showing the distant outline of the
new city

Only tvo buildings have been erected but they are of
lofty dimensions The walls are made witn clay bricks
The roofs are tiled with the same material

The reuaduder is a vast building site full of worlsen
Some of them are piling up bricks and tiles at various
points Others are transportins enorsous tree-trunks and
some are digging foundations

Sone are leying outlines with stakes Jucging from what
is already coupleted they seeu to be making a street
plan The streets run parallel and at right-angles
similar to a miniatuze version of the street plan of

liew Yori closer look shows street hoardings already
erected in some places on these it is possible to read
the names of some of the streets 5th avenuc 5th Street
etc

Taylor shepherds them towards the city talixing all the
time
TAYLOR

Of course were not able to build

any sizv-serapers yet T dont want

to in any case ‘VJelre nowhere near

the ase of concrete Here is our
principal material I was Lucky

enough to find a practically inexhaustible
clay-pit Bricks and tiles With

these and with wood from the forests

one could build a netropolis

Shot of the quavry at tie edge of the city where nen
are fetening clay and making the bricks and tiles Cnece
again the head woriusen is a very young boy The sisht
of the apes provokes the usual reaction Taylor ceals
with the situation as before

A more detafled shot of the work-site shows the organised
and efficient way the different jobs are being directed

- One workaan diss out the clay and shovels it into
another pit nearby
- Another treads the clay down after throwing water over
it to make it more malleable
ea third vorker a wouian this time puts the clay iuto
a mould of wood or of stone which has a shape cut into is
The last vorker on the production Line simply Lays the
nodelled clay in the sun to dry and harden

The young boy in charge goes fron one workman to another
giving instructions by sivns intersversed with a few words
He speaks to a man about tvice his size in a Severe tone
of voice

Head ‘“forlnan
Less water Too long to dry Ive
already told you six times You
will be punished
The man lowers his head and quickly gets rid of the water
ZIRA
Your forenen those that Ive seen

so far all seen to be little more
than children
- US a

TAYLOR
All of then told you that it
is the younger genetation for which
I have the most hope

CORMELIUS
And the elders obey these kids

TAYLOR

As you see ‘Without argument

LUCIUS

Very good strategy Excellent
organisation

Taylor takes them to the largest of the two completed
buildings

TAYLOR
This was the first building erected
in our city ‘which is the way I
wanted it and it is already in use
ZIRA

What is it

TAYLOR

The University This is where the
future teachers of man will learn

CORNELIUS

From you alone
- 46

TAYLOR (smiling)

I have a very valuabl’e assistant
Come and sec

Before entering the University Cornelius stops for a
moment and looks up at the building

CORNELIUS

You certainly have some lofty ideas

LUCIUS

You can never give too much space
to culture

TAYLOR

Never enough in fact But I have
left room for extensions

I think we will catch them unawares
while they are working -

Dont make any noise

They walk further into the building A chorus of young
voices are heard repeating words the effect is
reminiscent of nursery school Down a corridor is a door
leading inte a large room the students hall

There are no benches as yet The students are sitting on
the ground which is paved with bricks There are about
twenty pupils nearly all very young - about eight to
fifteen years old In the last row are a few adults who
scem to be having great difficulty in speaking and writins

They all have clay tablets in front of them (thekind used
in ancient times by the Egyptians or Babylonians) and a

pen consisting of a piece of pointed wood In this scene
the pupils are reciting the sentences written on the tablets
after their teacher

This teacher is none other than Sirius and his serious

expression bordering on severity contrasts strongly with
his youthful appearance He is seated on a stool in front
of a table On this table are several books but he only
refers to them occasionally By the slightly open door
concealed from sight the three chimpanzees watch and
listen with amazeisent Sirius’ speech is faultless
His pupils also articulate pretty well

SIRIUS (declaiming)

To be or not to be that is the question

Chorus of Pupils (repeating)
To be or not to be that is the question

SIRIUS
Whether ‘tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune

The Chorus (looking at their tablets)

Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune

SIRIUS (his voice swelling)

Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And so opposing end them

The chorus recites this rather badly Sirius reacts with
a conic show of authority He sclzes a long stick which
is in front of him and raps several times on the tadle -

SIRIUS

Bad very bud You are bellowing like a

herd of covs These words have great

meaning You must give them some cxpression
(He repeats the lesson putting great
emphasis on some of the words)

Or to take arms against a sea of trouble

And by opposing end them

The class repeats after him stressing the sane words in
a fair imitation

SIRIUS (in a burst of enthusiasia)

- to die Lo sleep
NO MORE
The class recites reproducing Sirius interpretation
At the door Lucius has been following the scene with
growing excitement He bursts into cheers

LUCTUS
Hurrah To die to sleep NO Noni

Uproar breaks out amongst the students at the sight of
the apes Taylor steps forward Sirius caliis his pupils
with a gesture

SIRIUS
Father what is the meaning of this

ZIRA (astonished)
Father

TAYLOR

My son Sirius that most valuable
auxilliary that I told you about

Ee is only thirteen years old but
one Would thins he was at least
sixteen The children develop faster
than they have in tne last couple of
snousand ycars Sirius of all
the anes these are the best I would
like you to be their friends

Zira offers her hand to Sirius he finally taxes it after
some hesitation but his feellaog of repugnance shows ia
his face LucLus also shakes hands while Cornelius ocers
at the tablets shaxing his head and muttering in an
undertone the last few words

CORUELIUS

To sleep Ho more

- ND -

Scene in front of the second house in the new city It
has a gnall sarcen with a few peices of garden furniture
made out of wood tables and rustic benches
TAYLOR

And this is my new home We
only moved in three days ago

ZIRA
We
Nova cones out of the house She is carrying a wooden
broo and a stone bucket containing dust and gravel ‘There
has to be an iinportant change in her manner and her way o
speaking She behaves in the sane way as any present day
housewife At first she only sees Taylor

NOVA

ws

These builders are the limit
The house is ina filthy state
TAYLOR
I have brought company you have
met them before Wova they
are old fricnds Do you remember
NOVA (in tones of comical reproach)
Why didnt you let me know in advance
that you were expecting guests
There is nothing prepared
TAYLOR (laughing)

They wont mind the mess or the
housekeeping
ZIRA

Im afraid we invited ourselves

Its you who must excuse us (offering
her hand) How do you do

I suppose I should call you hrsTaylor

NOVA

Call me Nova If you dont mind
I shall call you Zira

Taylor looxs on smiling as his wife and the female chinpan-
zee start to gossin in a slightly strained fashion Sirius
who has fejoined the party is also strained le stays
alone watching the friendly gathering with an expression
of reproach

ZIRA
Nova I marvel at everything Ive
seen herc Your new home is a real
gen

NOVA (mincing)
Oh Zira its not so very grand
(we only have three servants)
But how unforgivable of me You must
be nearly dying of hunger and thirst
after your journey

LUCIUS
Good gracious no

Nova runs towards the house

ZIRA
Can I do anything

NOVA
Thank you but Sirius will give me a
hand I will only be a inoment

(To Taylor) Darling make them sit
down they must be very tired
- Yl oo

Nova disappears into the house with Sirius Everyone
sits dowm on the benches Zira gazes after Nova
ZIRA

Extraordinary

TAYLOR

Isnt it Rut its during the
last three anys since she moved
into the house that she has made
the most astonishing progress I
ean hardly recognise her myself

LUCIUS (exalted)
Stupendous The greatest scientific
revolution of all time

GONMLIUS (musing)

Stupendous yes

TAYLOR

But men are great egotists Now
tell me what has been happening to
you That old misery daius is he
still around To-day I bear hin
no grudge

The three apes become gloomy Zira who is about to re reply
is interrupted by ‘ova wno re-appears in the doorwa

NOVA (to Taylor)
Darling could you come here for a
Minute Excuse us but the house
is still upside-down
Taylor and Nova disappear The three apes are left aloe
ZIRA (to Cornelius)

Why havent you told Taylor yet what
is going on
- ye

COnwsLIUS

Iam sorry But after seeing
the miraculous emergence of this
race there are moments when I ask
myself if Zaius is not justified in
thinking that there is a terrible
threat here to the simian race

ZIRA
You can see for yourself how peaceful
they are They are only interested
in working and in educating themselves

LUCIUS
Exactly

CORNELIUS

But apart from Taylor and Hova
havent you noticed the looks of hate
these men have been giving us
especially the younger ones

ZIRA
Ve have done a lot that they have to

forgive

LUCIUS

And we will make amends Goodness
and tolerance will come when the hate
is ended

ZIRA

This is a risk we must take We
have to tell hin

CONTLLIUS (after a pause)
So be it Tell hin
- 53

Nova and Sirius come out of the house carrying various
clay plates piled with fruit and vegetables a pitcher
and a bowl They pnt everything on the table Taylor
puts one arm round ijova and the other round Sirius

TAYLOR
Now you know the whole family It
is thanks to these two that I havo
been able to carry out my plans
NOVA
Let us eat Im sorry there is not
much to choose fron
PARIN

Just a minute Taylor Cornelius
has something very serious to tell

you
TAYLOR
Serious

Serious and most urgent It was
not simply curtosity that drove us to
make this journey Taylor

TAYLOR
I thought not

CORNELIUS

Zaius is still in power and is more of
an enemy to you now than ever before
As I speak he has already dealt youa
serious blow He has turned public
opinion against you and is preparing to
start a war against men
A silence follows Sirius who is still very tense frowns
deeply Taylor keeps calm and sits down at the table

TAYLOR (slowly)

I understand I also had no doubt
that this moment would come

The City of Apes In the same amphitheatre as before a
politician is calling for volunteers (the same politician
as on p 58 of the script of film ifol) Wext to hia on

the platform are three uniformed gorillas iew pennants
are floating overhead bearing various slogans Join the
YValient Simian Army The Sacred Duty of the Young is

to Fight There are pictures of a young ape standing

so much But to-day the tine for
sterile discussion is over To-day
we call you to war

Vibrant applause and shouts of To war To wari

Im appealing to-day to the younger
generation and I tell them this the
duty of every young ape old enough to
hold rifle is to join the fight if
they want to see the end of bestiality
on our planet It is your sacred duty
to volunteer to join in the ranks of
our valourous army and to serve under
our great generals who are only waiting
for this opportuaity to show their
heroism and bravery -

Fresh salvos of cheers and clapping The three officers
on the platform stand up and salute A military band
starts to play and the audience joins ina patriotic song
iveryone then stanés up andaaxes for the exits

They form a queue at the door of the amphitheatre where

same our army must be able to finish
off an unarmed rabble without
difficulty

ZAIUS
This rabble has a leader of diabolical
resourcefulness and cunning Wed
better acknowledge this amongst our-
selves and this man must now be on
his guard Zira and Cornelius
have been missing for several days

MAXIMUS

They have betrayed us

ZAIUS (in a rage)
These intellectuals are capable of
all kinds of treason in the name of
what they call their ideals
An usher (a gorilla) enters and announces
USHER

Field Marshal Urus
ZAIUS

Here he comes he asxed to
see me urgently Well take
advantage of the occasion to ask
hin a little more about his plans

Field Marshal Urus makes his entrance This is the first
time he is seen at close quarters He wears a very
gorgeous uniform resplencant with medals He miznt

wear a cap set on his head at an angle He is ina state
of great exciteuent If possible his mask should yive

an expression of great stupidity His stupidity is obvious
every time he opens his mouth

He enters makes a hurried salute and starts to speak

URUS

Excellency I am speaking to you

now as an old and experienced

campaigner I must be brutally

frank
ZAIUS (agitatedly)

Yes Yes I know that

What is it

unus

With all the respect that I owe you
Excellency but with the firmness

that my hish resvonsibilities demand
(a look of exasncration passes betyveen
Zaius and haxinus) I have to say
Excellency that this state of affairs
cannot be allowecé to continue We
cannot postpone onerations any longer
The guns must sound and sound loudly
Any holding back would be considered
as weakness by our soldiers and what is
worse by our enemies

ZAIUS
What are you trying to say
URUS

The effrontery of these men can

be borne no longer Last night
they made anothcr successful raid
on one of our advance canps

ZAIUS

Again (furiously) and naturally
as on previous occasions you were
not on guard

URUS

These brutes use the most wifair
methods They operate at night
Furthermore this time they played
the most infamous trick to deceive
us

MAXINUS
What trick

URUS

They had the cheek to disguise
thenselves as apes Yes ona
previous raid they had stolen sone
of our clothes and

Actual shot of the scene as told by Urus it is night
Two lines of men march silently throuzh the forest one
led by Taylor the other by Sirius Taylors group are
drdssod up in apes clothing Taylor and a fev others
have a complete costume the reuainder are partially
clothed some in shirts the others in trousers Taylor
stops them at the edge of a muddy stream
TAYLOR (in a low voice)
Do the same as I do

He takes a handful of mud and rubs it over his face and
hands The uen who are partially dressed cover the rest
of their bodies with mud The youn taen in Sirius
party who are not disguised cover thelselves all over
with the mud Taylor and Sirius inspect their groups
and correct a few details They are completely trans-
formed Lumps of thick mud alter their features till
they look quite grotesqu3z In the darkness they could
be mistaken for a troup of apes

TAYLOR
Good You know what to do Sirius
You circle the post and you launch
yourselves on my signal Our
objective this time are guns and
ammunition
SIRIUS
Right
The two groups separate Taylors group is seen filtering
through the forest Taylor is imitating the waddling
gait of the apes The others copy him
The raiding party arrive in sight of their post which is
lit by a single lamp Taylor halts the main body of his

group and goes forward with two of his wen A gorilla
sentry spots him

Sentry

Who goes there

TAYLOR
An envoy from the Field Marshal

Sentry

Come nearer - just you
Taylor goes forward waddling from side to side
TAYLOR

I have a message for the head of
this company

The sentry holds out his hand Taylor fells him with one
blow of his truncheon He motions his men over They
come forward and conceal themselves near the door Taylor
raps on the door

Voice fron inside

What is 1t

TAYLOR
A message from the General of State
An NC0 opens the door The men rush through
TAYLOR
Sirius Over here
Sirius party of young men invade the garrison throuzh
the back windows - A scene of complete chaos - Taken
by’ surprise and terrified by their attackers grotesque
appearance the apes are quickly overpowered Two
entrances are smashed in by blows from the spears
Taylor aims his rifle at the head of the garrison who
eries out in terror

Head of the Garrison

Mercy TI surrender

TAYLOR
Drop your guns quickly
The apes obey him and the men gather up all the arns
TAYLOR

Where aré the rifle and anmunition
stores
Head of the Garrison (pointing to a door)

Over there
TAYLOR
The key

Head of the Garrison
But 6 « «

Sirius lifts his spear menacingly The gorilla quickly
hands over the key In an orderly fashion the men load
the rifles and cases of amuunition onto their backs and
disperse into the obscurity of the night - indisn file
Taylor Sirius and a nunber of the yowng boys cover thei
retreat and then disappear in turn

Field Marshal Urus finishes his story in Gaius office

URUS
The height of trickery Could we
disguise ourselves as tien us
And they vanisned into the shadows
the sane way as they appeared
like rats

ZAIUS (foaming with rage)
Ts that all you can find to say
And now they are armed How many
rifles have you let them get away
with

yvaus

Fifty Excellence
ZAIUS

And you have not executed your
Garrison Chief And your
soldiers did not go after then

URUS (sheepishly)

They did try your Lxcellence but

our soldiers are not used to darkness
or to the forest - while these

monsters are as much in their element
as fishes in water They made an
attempt to follow and that cost
the life of one of our men he was
pierced by an arrow we dont know
where it came fron An arrow
Excellency If were going to start
waging var with arrows who can forcsee
where that will lead us That is why
I implore you enough of these
perfidious nocturnal raids The thing
to do is to wage a glorious battle

in the light of the sun Let us launch
a major attack in their own country and
erush them conpletely

ZAZUS

Good That is the wish of us all
Now tell us what strategy you intend
to enploy

URUS (flustered)

Strategy

ZATUS

You and your General of State youve
surely prepared a plan of the battle
- 6 «

URUS

A plan Of course ‘We invade
their territory I will be at the
head of mr cavalry and the moment

we have them in sight we will charge
over them and exterminate the majority
Theres nothing like a cavalry charze
Excellence

ZATUS (softly to iaxtmus)

The cavalry Thats the only thing
he Imows

URUS

And behind us the infantry will

follow our charge occupy the territory
kill the survivors and take sotie
prisoners back to replenish our cages
That is my plan of tattle

ZAIUS

And what will the enemy be doing all
this tine

URUS

Eneny ‘What eneny Ah the

men (He bursts out laughing ilo more
enemies Sxcellence Finished
annihilated

ZAIUS (exasperated softly to
Waxinus )

Stupid brute ‘that do you think
MAXIRUS
I think there is no doubt that he is

the ape that should conduct this
battle After all its only a question (cont
- 65 -
Maximus (cont )
of crushing a few primitive
beinss Fifty rifles in the
hands of inexperitnced creatures
are not going to repcl a serious
attack
ZAIUS (to the other two orang-utans)

Is that your opinion

The Orang-Utans

That is our opinion Excellence

ZAIUS (handing a docwaent to Urus)
Agreed Here is the order to start
operations After all you are
right about one thinz it is time
to make a decisive move

URUS (his hand on his heart)

Thank you Excellency I will
not return until I am victorious

The Marshal salutes and retires his face is radiant The
sound of cheers can be heard from the street as he leaves

ZAIUS
Its not the fifty rifles that
worry me
So
ZATUS

Man has more subtle weapons at
his disposal

The kingdom of men In front of Taylors house is the
apes chariot JZira and Cornelius are taking leave of
Taylor and Nova Lucius is standing slightly to one
side
TAYLOR
Why go back Your fellow apes
will not forgive you
CcoRWLIUS
We must leave you Taylor Weve
done all that we can for you
TAYLOR
Nevertheless you know yourselves
fhat the Right is on our side
CORIZLIUS

My place is amongst the apes

TAYLOR
And you Zira

ZIRA
My place is with Cornelius
Lucius have you decided
LUCIUS
I have decided and I will stay

My place is on the side of freedom
and justice
CORMHLIUS
God grant that you will not
regret it

ZInA

And that this war will ond
quickly in general peace That
is why I am going Taylor It is
towards that end that we must work

CORIELIUS

If we are given a chance to do so
Good luck Taylor Goodbye Nova

Zira clasps Nova in her arms and hugs her with emotion
ZIRA

Isnt Sirius here

NOVA (embarrassed)
He asked me to say goodbye for hin
He is so busy organising our defences

CORNELIUS

And after all in his eyes we will
always be wicked apes in spite of
all our efforts to nelp you Your
younser generation will not accent
a single ape

TAYLOR

I hope too that one day that will
change

CORWELIUS (climbing into the chav

Good luck Lucius
LUCIUS (gravely)
Goodbye Cornelius Goodbye Zira

The chariot starts off and moves out of sisht Nova
Taylor and Lucius watch it go Wova wip away a tear
It is the first time she has been seen to «ry

TAYLOR (to Lucius)

You have no regrets

LUCTUS

None We will perish or triwnph
together

TAYLOR
We will triuiph

LUCIUS

I hope so Listen to me Taylor
Iocan help you I am familiar with
the stupidity and vanity of our
military chiefs Their only weapon
that is of real danger to you is
the cavalry If you can set a trap
to foil the cavalry the victory is
yours The infantry is a poorly
eauipped crowd that would soon
surrender

TAYLC

I will think of sc-thing In the
meantime come and -°cch the training
of our guerrillas

7

Over to the men - preparing a trap Taylor has organised
a great many workers for the job - nearly all the adults
even the old ones and auite a few of the women

They are digsing an enormous trench tvo or three metres
deep with straight steep walls which stretches in a iong
line in front of the plantation In spite of the primitive
tools employed the work is progressing very fast The men
are hollowing the trench with a kind of yick-axe and
throwing the soil into wicker baskets A long line of
women carry the baskets away on their heads and enpty then
in the forest (as the Chinese coolle women used to carry
things some years ago)

A large part of the trench is already hollowed out Soric
other workmen are gathering branches and grecuery to cover
the trench Taylor is there Lucius at his side keeping
an eye on the workers
LUCIUS
Your men are good workers TI never
thought they would be able to get this
far so quickly with such prinitive tools
TAYLOR

They have very capable hands Every-
thing will be ready in two days

Sirius appcars leading a group of boys eacn one carries
a bundle of snarp stakes
TAYLOR
What have you got there

SIRIUS
I had an idea father Look
He jumps into the trench at a point where it is being

eanouflased ana drives a staxe into the bottom the sharp
end pointing upward Taylor doesnt speak
SIRIUS
Isnt that a good idea

LUCIUS
It is cruel

TAYLOR (after another silence)

Ib is cruel But we did not make
this war and we nust win It is
a good idea Sirius Plant your
stakes

Sirius distributes the stakes and allots different parts
of the trench to one boy after another Taylor and Lucius
watch in silence The boys are whispering together

One Boy (pushing another forward)

Go on - dont be afraid Show it
to the-man-who-talks

The Other Boy

I darent

First Bov

Idiot Go on I tell you (he pushes him forward)

TAYLOR

What 1s all this Its you John
Are you still working on your picture

The young man who emerces from the groun is secn to be

the artist who was painting in the cave Now he is seen
more clearly he is a young man of gentle appearance almost
effeminate who speaks shyly in a ver soft voice He is
holding a metallic-looking object about the same size and
shape as an oranze

JOY

For some time Ive been doing some-
thing else (he holds out the object) (cont
John (cont

I made this (he 1s very embarrassed)
but I dont imow if its of any use

TAYLOR
What is 1

JOLT

TI made it out of cartridge cases

used in the exercises Sirius yave
me permission to collect then
Then I melted them over a fire

a very hot fire then I set then in

a mould and put sand in the middle
like we make bricks - Aftervards

I made a hole in the middle and then
let it cool Look its pretty

So I see ‘hat do you think you can
do with 1t

JOHN

First I didn™t really know Then

I had another idea We have a lot

of ammunition Sirius allowed me to
open some cartridges They vere
filled with povder I opened sone
other cases and put the powcer togetner
When I had a lot I filled up ny orange
Look

TAYLOR (he is staring fixedly)
‘Why do you call that an orango
SIRIUS (who has climbed out of
the trench)

I called it that father because it
looxs Lite a fruit Dat I think that
it has possidilities Go on John
What do you do with your orange

JOH (laughing)

Oh I had great fun I had taken
the detonating caps too

TAYLOR

hich you also put carefully to one
side I am sure

JOT

Certainly Everything cau be useful
Then afterwards (he suddenly
speaks with the excitement of an artist
realising the value of his vork)

Later on I dont know why but I

started to lzugh really laugh
because I had an idea which struck

me as being very fumny TI iixcd sone

of She caps with the powder in the
orange and then I hunted around
searched for ages There was something
missing I looked for days and
nights andIfoud ittTI
found it the bark of a certain
tree very Gry which catches fire
quickly I twisted it like a vine

TAYLOR

Affuse

JOH (laughs again)

A fuse I never thought of that name
but its very funy aA fuse yes a
fuse So I made a little hole in the
orange I put in the fuse I set it

(cont )
(John cont )
aliszht and threw it Oh I threw
it very far avay and I stood bchind
a tree because it made a very loud
bang Would you like to seve it

STRIUS

Please father let him give you a
demonstration You will see that
its worth the trouble I believe
its a great invention

TAYLOR (heavily sadly)
I dont doubt it

sINIUS

Theres nothing like an artist for
having ideas It seems quite simple
and no-one thought of it before

TAYLOR (with a sense of overwhelming
despondency)

No-one Sirius Wo-one Go ahead
John Have your demonstration
Artist Show us all the resources
of your art

JOHY (always laughing)

Ill throw it into the trench
that will be best That way there
wont be any risk

A young boy brings John sone lighted sticks John onens
his grenade carefully with a pin He sets light to the
fuse and throws it far away into the interior of the
trench There is a brilliant explosion The men who are
scared at first lift up their heads

JOHN

Its over now We can go and see
Taylor Lucius and Sirius and the artist go to see the
site of the explosion All around the bottom of the
trench is riddled with chips and splinters A fairly
long silence

TAYLOR
How many of these oranges
have you made

JOHN

Twelve But if you give me some
more cartridges I can make a lot
its very simple

LUCIUS (nodding his head)
Simple as he says very simple

And to think we never thought of
such a thing we apes

Two sentries hidden in the rocks (the same ones vho
challenged the three apes) The man with the bow is stretehcd
out on the ground The other is keeping watch
The Watcher (who carries a bow)

Here Come and see

Man with Spear
Its them The apes The enemy
There is a distant cloud of dust and the same time the
sound of horses is heard The first lot of riders is seen
thYough itls not possible to distinguish individuals They
are advancing slowly

Go and tell the man who speaks
Quickly
Man with Sconr

And you

Man with Bow

Ill stay hidden here TI must
have a shot perhaps a straggler

The other hurries across the rocks reaching the forest
and disappears running

pS

Taylor Sirius Lucius and several groups of nen are at

the trench The tran is ready invisible under the foliage
It is possible to cross by making a detour through a thick
jungle Taylor zives instructions to a group of men armed
with bows and arrows a young boy is in charge of the

group

TAYLOR (to the boy)

Do you understand everything

Boy

I understand We stay here crouched

in the busnes our veapous are nidden
When the apes cavalry arrive we get up
as if-we are terrified as in the
past Run about everywhere left

right backwards and forwards

TAYLOR
Good

Boy

Just like we used to Then the cavalry
charges us but they dont see the
trench (he laughs) charge into

the trench Wham pouff (all ourst
out laughing) Then we pick up our gums
- OL -

TAYLOR

—

Perfect And my group nidden in
the forest will join you ab that
point

A female sentry runs uo panting She stops on the far side
of the trench and calls

SENTRY

The apes The army of apes They
have crossed the border

TAYLOR
Did you get here fast

SEWTRY

I ran all the way

TAXLOR

We still have a few hours left
Sirius it is time to lie in wait with
your company You understand your
assignment

SIRIUS

I let all the cavalry go by Then I
attack frou the rear when I hear the
shooting start over here

TAYLOR (takes him to one side)

One last thing Strius I am sure we
will be victorious Once that is
achieved I cont want tiere to be a
senseless massacre Your toys are very
hot-headed Its your duty to keep them
under control
SIRIUS (rolls his eyes)
Ill try to

TAYLOR
You will bring all the prisoners
straight here And to finish with
we will march to the City of Apes
together and make peace Lucius
have you decided - Which group do
you want to join

Lueius points to Sirius and his party of young guerillas
who are preparing to go

LUCIUS
With them TI think my presence
will be of most use

TAYLOR (after a silence)

Its your choice Da you want a gun

LUCIUS (bends his head)
No gun
Sirius and his company march into the forest Lucius
follows them alone at the back The young wen sive hin
some nasty looks Taylor watches them disappear then
he turns to his men
TAYLOR

Everyone to their stations

Thenarmy of apes The head of the colum with Urus and
his generals of state are riding along the beach they
come to the Statue of Liberty
An Officer
What is that

URUS
Ive heard of it Its some
prehistoric monument of no interest
Forward
The groupare passing through the forest
Officer
Where the hell are the devils
hiding I still havent seon any
sign of them
URUS
They have gone to earth terrified
No doubt we will have to smoke then
out
In the forest hidden in the thickets we see Sirius and
some of his inen The leading members of the cavalry pass
in front of them One of the boys raises his rifle
Sirius has to pull him down He mutters
SIRIVS

Are you crazy Youre going to ruin
everything

An Officer (pricking up his ears)
I thought I heard a noise

URUS
What noise

Officer
Sounded like some-one talixing
URUS (shrugging his shoulders)

Youre beginning to act like a
chimpanzee my friend ext youll
be hearing human voices like that
Zira

All the officers burst out laughing

View of the trap Total silence Taylor has disappeared
On the far side of the trench we see the men crouched among
the bushes and their young commander The boy makes a
signal

The Boy

Get ready theyre coming

The head of the cavalry emerge from the forest and draw
nearer Urus Aiscovors the enoriuous clearing he sees
the plantation and the future citv in the distance At
last he sees the men He brandishes his sword

URUS

They are here Take up your
battle positions

The cavalry assemble their lines and prepare their rifles
The boy gives his signal Inmediately the hwnans start
running in all directions lixe mad-men

URUS
I told you so Theyre scuttling like
rabbits ‘Ihat a marvellous spot for a

cavalry charge (he turns to his
troops) Ready to charge

Chorus of Officers

Ready
URUS (facing around and pointing
his sword)

Charge

He breaks into a gallop followed by tie entire cavalry
An extraordinary spectacle of anes making a cavalry cuurge
as they were made in the previous century A few shots

are fired The men appear and disappear anongst the bushes
as if playing hide and seex

Taylor hidden in the forest his rifle ready motions
his men to prepare themselves

Fresh view of the charge Urus his sword in front of him
is the first to reach the trench The branches collapse
The field marshal somersaults and is followed by his
officers of state and then the entire line of cavalry fall
on top of them Complete chaos Shouts frou the apes ond
neighing of horses wounded by the stakes

Different angles of the fight Taylor gives his signal and
starts to fire into the fracas Hore shots fron his group
and hundreds of arrows rain down on the cavalry

Finally we see the painter The nan with the ‘oranves
He is very calmly with great sang froid lishting his
fuse and throwing nis explosives one after another The
explosions punctuate the noise of the battle regularly

The disorder in the trencn has reached its height
Taylor calls his men

TAYLOR
Forward Attack
The two grouns converse on the trench where the horses
and gorillas are trying to escane “Zand to hand fighting

follows with spears truncheons etc The gorillas
are demoralised and getting tne worst of it

Hidden in the forest Sirius and his men are watching the
army file past The cavalry has been gone for some tine
The final chariots pass oy pulling the coes Sirius is

strung up and impatient Finally the noise of the battle
is heard Sirius stands up

SIRIUS

Thats our signal

Same tactics aa Taylor First a volley of shots and
hail of arrows Again and again the boys recharge their
weapons The infantry taken by surprise starts to
disintegrate

SImius

Attack

The whole group throw themselves into the assault

Back to the battle at the trench The trench is craned
with the corpses of monxey and horses There is still a
furious hand to hand fight but it is obvious that the
monkeys have lost the battle
Urus on foot his uniform torn to shreds his heliet and
sword lost is trying t® escape Taylor notices hin
rushes over and holds hin at gunpoint

TAYLOR

——

Surrender yourself

URUS (piteously)
I surrender

Taylor imprisons his arms behind his back and frog-marches
hin to the top of a raised mound

TAYLOR

Order a general retreat Order all
the apes to drop their guns

unus (shouting)

Cease-fire Lay down your arms
Most of the gorillas obey him The men are more difficult
to stop They continue fighting with spears and lances
Taylor intervenes forcefully

TANTOR

Stop You too The apes have

surrendered ‘fe have conquered

them Victory

Some Ken (echoing)

Victory Victory
Soon the vord passes in a chant throughout the corpany
Its now possible to hear in the women and children wo
have been taking shelter in the new city They appear in
the distance and come towards the soldiers chanting

Chorus of lonen

Victory Victory Victory

Nova appears at the head of the column of vonen and comes

towards Taylor vith outstretched arms widlst the cry of
Victory re-echoes throughout the forest

The camera moves over the breadth of the forest as the
eries of Victory” from the centse of the battle becoue
faint in the distance a fresh clamour grows until the
camera comes to Sirius group wnere the noise is even

greater than that of the main battle Sirius coupany is
even wilcer than Taylors men

Yells fron the Povs
Victory Victory

We come quickly into the centre of the fighting which is
becoming a complete massacre Taken by surprise winy of
the apes went cown under the first attack iany trfed to
escape but were surrounded by men vith spears who
accompanied Sirius youn storm-troopcers The spears cariv
them towards Sirius boys who completely out of control
- 68 -

are shooting in successive bursts The apes are jn a pantc

and now scurrying away in confusion like a herd of trapped

beasts

A gorilla officer drops his rifle and raises his aris
Officer

Stop Merey TI surrender

ABoy
No thercy for the apes

Ne shoots him down The same scene is repeated with a
group of four or five other soldiers massed behind un
officer who waves a white handkerchief The boys close
in on him and start firing Lucius watchin3 tnis tries
to intervene

LUCIUS

Stop They have surrendered

ABoy

No prisoners Wo quarter Death
to all the apes

A menacing circle foriis round Lucius He makes another
attempt to stop them

LUCIUS (shouting)

Tama friend you mow that
Your leader the ‘‘an-vho-talks
gave the order no senseless killing

He is interrupted by increasingly threateraing cries
A Boy

Our leader Sirius is our true
leader Sirius speaks better
than the Uan-who-talks And ve
are we not also now the men-who-talk
« « Death to all the apes

Another Boy

One day Sirius told me the only
good ape is a dcad ape death
to all the apes

Lucius cathces sight of Sirius inflamed by the battle
aiming at a gorilla who kneels on the ground

LUCIUS

Sirius its your father your own
father who gave the order

sIniIus

My father hasnt suffered like these
people have I am one of then because
my mother was

He fires on the gorilla This starts off a fresh maszacvre
Lucius who trics to intervene is wounded in turn by a spear
and falls to the ground

His assailant yells

There are no good apes Death to
all apes Victory Victory

As the hunting and massacre of the apes progress a strange
phenorienon takes place Little by livtle they start to
revert to the wannerisms and habits of their past animal
ancestry

For instance ‘We notice two or three gorillas hesitating
in their flight and Gronnine on all fours to continue as
if it were more natural to thei Zney revert to an
upright position after a few bounds

Another svmatom A gorilla to escape from his pursuers
Tuns towcarcas ouc of the trees and starts to clinb out of
reach Then for a feu moments Nis noverients are those
of a real ave He is killed anvway

The fighting dies down the ground is covered with corpscs
Apart from a few apes who escaped to the forest the entire
infantry has been massacred
A Boy
Victory The army is finished
But thats not good enough ‘le
must destroy the city of apes
We must finish off all the apes

bifferent Voices

Hes right To the city Death
to all apes

SIRIUS (with difficulty)
Hy father the lan-who-Speaks

has told us to join him We will
all march to the city together

Cries of Protest

Theres no more need for the lian-who-
Speaks wea are all men who speak
The Man-who-Speaks is the friend of

sone apes he is no longer our leader
Sirius Sirius you are our Chief You
alone are one of us Sirius lead

us to the city of apes Death to all apes

SIRIUS (Cafter a pause)

After all this victory is ours It
is better to finish it off quieily
You are right Byveryone soliow me
To the city of apes

Great cheers and yells With Sirius and the young boys
leading the whole company marches off

The battle field falls into silence Surrounded by corpses
an ape slowly raises hinself on his elbow and watches

the last men disappear It is Lucius He holds his hand
across his bloodied chest and gives a sob

- 91 -

3A

In the other field of battle everything has calmed down

The ape prisoners have been rounded up and are being guarded
by men armed with spears and rifles The apes are docile
and subdued Taylor is pacing up and down ond is vory
agitated Nova watches him anxiously

NOVA
And Sirius
TAYLOR
He should be here The battle has

been over for some time now and he
has won

NOVA

Are you sure

TAYLOR

Positive I know him and he had the
easiest job He is victorious I know
but (hesitantly) This victory
is beginning to worry me as much as

a defeat

NOVA
Why

TAYLOR

He is some-one who knows how to get
over a defeat I am not so sure now
that he knows how to handle a victory
To do that you have to be a saint
or an imbecile like me What can he
be doing He should have joined us
long ago I am going to go over
there

NOVA
Im coming with you
- 92 -

TAYLOR
If you like Perhaps it only needs
his father and mother to make him
see reason (he calls to one of the
boys) Take command of the camp
while Im gone I am going to meet
Sirius No-one must touch the
prisoners Give them something to
eat Only shoot if they try to escape
(he gives the apes a long look) In any
case they wont move They are quite
resigned

a ah

On the battle-field littered with

corpses Lucius is dragging himself

painfully towards the trees
Taylor and Nova arrive at that moment They are on
horseback and are followed by a small escort of armed
men Taylor stops in stypification on seeing the extent
of the carnage There are moans from the wounded

NOVA (with sadness)

Victory

TAYLOR (enraged)
Victory I did not want this

The faint voice of LUCIUS
Victory

TAYLOR
Lucius
He jumps from his horse and runs to Lucius
TAYLOR
Who did this
LUCIUS
The men (he tries to smile)
It is an ancient instinct re-emerging
from the deptns of centuries gone by
TAYLOR

But Sirius

LUCIUS (stretching his aria)

Go quickly and try to stop him
I was not able to

Lucius falls back dead

The City of Apes Zaius is pacing up and down in his
office his hands behind nis back in front of his three
orang-utan councellors
ZAIUS
This field marshal Urus is playing

games with us He must have had a
show-down with the enemy by now

No nevs is good news
The other Crang

What did the last report say

MAXILUS

A triumphant prosression of occupation

ZAIUS

Triumphant They had still not met
with any resistance
Without doubt hecause the enemy

is so terrified that they have

gone into hiding
A noise of horses hooves and general calmouring Zaius
goes to the window A mounted corilla is coming into
sight He is surrounica by a group of passers-by He
leaps off his horse and rushes into Zaius house

ZAIUS

News from Urus at last

It is to announce the victory
A few seconds later the gorilla bursts into the office
A dramatic entrance He is covered in swoat and blood
his clothes are in tatters

Gorilla

They are coming Excellency They

are on their way They are marching

on the city

The same amphitheatre as before the same politician is
making a speech We hear

Politician

« « -While waiting for the news of
complete victory which cant be
long now it is the duty of every
ape

His voice is gradually drowned by shouts of the men
the men ‘Je then sce the politician hesitate stutter
lose face look around him from right to left and finally
jump off the platform and run off - he also runs on all
fours from tine to time

In the temple where the preacher is in the middle of an
analogical sermon the same rusour grows With the sane
result
- 95

Final cut back to Zaius office where exactly the saae
kind of panic and confusion is taking place whilst the
rumour The men The neni is heard from the strects
The two orans-utans also seen to have completely lost
their heads They rush from one side of the roou to the
other like caged animals and also kecp dropping on all
fours

Zaius the only one who has kept calm watches them angrily
and bangs violently on his desk

ZATUS

Behaveg yoursclves like apes
(yelling) Stand up straight

He restores a bit of order Zaius questions the gorilla
ZAIUS
You lie Youve lost your nerve
It is not possible Where is our
cavalry
The gorilla collapses on a chair gasping
Gorilla
Fallen into a terrible trap
Pinned down by thousands of arrows

ZATUS

And Field Marsial Urus

Gorilla

He is captured with the survivors
Allare dead or captured

A fresh outburst of madness from the orang-utans which
Zaius stops

ZAIUS (shouting)
Stand up The infantry
- Yoo s

Gorilla

Taken by surprise No prisoners
there All of them are killed

Tha Oranys
All

Gorilia

Bxcept a few who ran to the forest
and were not shot as they escaped

ZATUS

Covards And you say that
the men are marching towards our
city

Gorilla

The youngest of them They are

the most savage they hate us They
will be here in a few hours if not
sooner

MAXIIUS (the only one apart from Zatus
who has not completely lost
his head)

Excellence the situation is very
serious We are in immediate danger
We must do something

An Orang (maddened)
What to do What to do Our arny

is annihilated There are only a
few police left We are done for
I beg you to keep calm (shouting
again) and stand upright
Have you anything to suggest Dr
Maximus

MAATIVUS

There is only one course open to us
Excellence ‘We must make peace
negotiate

ZAIUS

Do you think that these militants
will negotiate with me with any
of us

MAXINUS

Not with us no But perhaps
with Zira and Cornelius

ZATUS

The traitors that I have ordered to
be shot tomorrow

MAXINUS

They are the only ones who may save
us to-day ixcellency And there
is not a moment to lose

The streets are full of rumours and there is the sound of
istant firing A new shot orf the square where panic has
reached its hishest peak Many of the anes are now
running about on all fours and the cry The men the men
ids interspersed with inarticulate grunting

At the city entrance The arrival of Sirius column
The few policemen who tried to bar the way are beaten
and runn off The men mareh into the city pillasing
everything in their path In the anphithcatre the
politician is waving a white flag in the middle of a
crowd who have taken refuge there He is slaughtered
along with most of the others

The hunt for apes reaches the temple where the preacher
is discovered on all fours under a bench with sone of
his followers The temple is destroyed and the Statue
of Law Giver is smashed

The sacking of the city goes on

Sirius as excited as his men occasionally gives brief
orders We see him perched on the balcony of the
amphitheatre

SIRIUS

Listen to me all of you This
wicked city must be wiped from the
face of this planet Only fire can
purify this foul place so that it
turns to ashes that the wind may
blow away

Different Voices

Raise it to the ground Yes Sirius
is right Fire Fire

The cry of Fire Fire Fire is repeated by all with
enthusiasm reminscent of the earlier scene where they
discovered fire for the first time

The men run here and there collecting all sorts of
furniture and objects from the houses they pillage They
pile everything into a great heap in the amphitheatre
whilst the cry of Fire resounds throughout the city

It is evening the sun is setting and Taylor and Nova are
hurrying forvard on horseback their small escort has
difficulty in kzeping up with them They arrive in siunt
of the city Taylor stops and stares A thick cloud of
smoke starts to curl upwards

Ive come too late

NOVA
And Sirius
They gallop towards the city leaving the men behind

ko
Nieht-fall in the city The amphitheatre is becoze a
furnace which illuminates the the surrounding ruins The
young men and children dance around the fire Smaller fires
are burning round about There are sillhouettes of apes
running in the shadows pursued by men

Perched on top of the pile is the partially broken statue
of tho Law Tiver that the flauca have not yet veachad

Suddenly Zira and Cornelius appear and behinc them a small
troup of chimpanzees Zira shouts to make herself heard

PAGING
Stop We are not enemies We would
like to make peace
ABoy

Who is thés monkey who dares to
raise her voice

He goes forward to hit Zira Cornelius deflects the blow
CONMELIUS

I would like to speak to your leader
He Imows that we have always been your
friends

A few of the men hesitate at his tone of authority

appears

ZIRA

Sirius I once saved the lives of
both your father and your mother

aBo yY

This one is a doctor of Biology
She used to make her experiments on
our fathers and mothers

Another

There are no good apes Death
to the monkcv

CORSLIUS

It was I who out forward the idea
that you vere not animals but
intelligent beings like ourselves
and that you had a glorious past
Because of that the apes have
persecuted me

Shouts (iixed with sarcasm)

It 1s you who are an ugly beast

SIRIUS

There is only one intelligent being
on this planet and that is man

Sirius
- AA -

Echoes in the Crowd
Man Man Wan

The boys advance threateningly closing in around the
chimpanzees One of thea is struck down Taylor and
Nova arrive at a gallop

TAYLOR (leaping from his horse)

Sirius I told you there was to
be no massacre ‘We have conquered
Peace must be made

A Boy

No peace with the apes No peace
until every ape is dead

He strikes a chimpanzce who falls to the ground Taylor
steps between them snouting
TAYLOR

———

I forbid you

Voice in the Crowd

The Han who Spcaxs caunot forbid us
le are all men who speak

I taught you to speak tauzht you
how to thint It was I who raised
you out of your bestial condition
(shouting) It was I who gave you fire
And this this is what you do

Voices
It is Sirius who tauzht us Sirius

who showed us how to fight Sirius

TAYLOR
Sirius ‘What does this mean to say
Sirius looks avay and doesnt reply Silcntly sone of
the boys surrowic Taylor One of them with a quicic
movement takes his rifle Taylor who tries to keep it
is seized and held

SIRIUS

Father you must let us alone
This is our affair

TAYLOR (struggling)

I am not going to let you kill
Massacre my friends Youll have
to kill me first
One of the boys covers Taylor with a gun
NOVA (Anploringly)
Sirius
Sirius turns away the rifle point and hesitates
SIRIUS (to the boys)
Enough (in an undertone to Taylor)

Father we will not kill your friends
the chimpanzees that I promise but

Shouts from the Boys
who have overheard
Sirius wants to capitulate Sirius
is betraying us
sInius
Enough
Sirius climbs onto a bench yelling to be heard
- WS

SIRIUS

The time has come to stop the

massacre (hostile cries) Silence

I am telling you this because we need
prisoners (gradually the silence
returns) We have a great need for
Slaves to work for us ‘Je need trained
animals to amuse our children

ABoy
Slaves Sirius is right

Another Rov

And we need live guinea-pigs for our
scientific experiments

SIRIUS

There are plenty of empty cares
in the city Round up all the
surviving apes and hérd them in

Fresh applause By the light of the conflagration the hunt
for the apes begins The cry goes up Into the cages with
the apes into the zoo with the apes The apes have by
now ¥¥4¥ completely lost their nerve and are trausforucd
into a herd of beasts They all walk on four legs end
mutter unintelligably

ul

An enorious cage is seen by the light of the various
conflagrations A Mast nuaber of apes are being prodded
into this cage Zira and Cornclius ave anongst then

They are already ingde behind bars silently watching the
hunting of the apes outside and the chaos amongst then in
the case - yes even the chimpanzees have started to behave
like animals

Sirius is near the cage Taylor and Nova are also bein
watched closely by a group of boys Suddenly there is a
fresh outburst of noise
lok -«

Shouts
aius Zaius

A group is pushing Dr Zatus in front of them prodding
him with lances

ABoy

We found him as he was about to
escape on horscback What shall we
do with him Sirius

SIRIUS

Our worst cneny A marvellous
specinen of the simian race We
must treat him with great care
(laughing) Keep hin separate in

a specially frightening cage to watch
his downfall Come Im going to see
to it myself

They take Zaius who passes in front of Taylor who is
himself a virtual prisoner Zaius and Taylor exchange
a long look
ZAIUS
I know man better than you Taylor

Zailus receives several blows and is led away Sirius
disappears with the group

CORNELIUS (from the case)
There you are Taylor ‘You have won

The old rule which finished two
thousand years ago is re-established

TAYLOR (in despair)

The old rule Return of the old rule
And it is I and my son (he
buries his face in his hands)
ZIRA

I dont want you to blame yourself
Taylor ‘Je are punished for our
price

ABoy

When is that filthy monkey going to
stop talkins ‘Why has she got the
cheek to stand up lilie a man

We see that Zira and Cornelius are nearly the only ones
left standing uprizht in the cage The others are either
squatting or on all fours

The boy prods Zira with his spear and Cornelius tries to
shield her Taylor gives a yell frees nincelf from his
guards rushes towards the boy and strikes him A shot
rings out Taylor falls to the ground dead Nova throws
herself on hin and hisses hin frantically

A long silence The boys form an awed circle round his
body

One or two (in undertohes)

The Man who Speaks the ian who Speaks
is dead

Another

He deserved to die He betrayed us
Ee was a friend of the apes

The rest stay silently round ifova who guards the hody with
Qn wnapproachable ferocity They take no more notice of
Zira and Cornelius
ZIRA (ina low voice)

I could not have dreampt it would

lead to this I could not have

foreseen such a thing

CORMELIUS

I knew it would happen but I regret
nothing
- 106 -

ZIRKA (pointing to the blazing
city and the corpses)

Did you foresee all this

CORIELIUS

I foresav it and also other
things because that is not
the worst Look

He shows her the interior of the cage where the apes
having lost all their human characteristics are behaving
exactly like caged animals They run about without purpose
on all fours and others shake the bars and stamp their
feet giving littie cries Others are on their haunches

as af it was natural to then

ZIRA (with horror)

You are right This is the worst
part Do you thin do you
believe we will become like them too

CORSLIUS

Iam afraid I can feel old
instincts troubling my head and
paralysing my brain Occasionally
Gira I find it difficult to think

ZIRA

I feel the same I can feel my senses
disolving like a mist (fervently)
We must avoid that at all costs

We must do something and do it now
while we still possess the vestises of
reason In an hour perhaps it will be
too late Animals cannot take decisions

CORIGLIUS (gravely)

I have thought about it
This also I have foreseen
- 107 -
He takes two ampules of poison from his pocket and gives
one to Zira
ZINA (smiling)

Thank you for having also thought
of me

They embrace each other put the ampule into thcir nouths
and bite hard They fall clasped in each others aris

More scenes of madness in the cage illuninated by the
firelisht whilst the head of the Law Giver disfigured
by fire tumbles down into cinders - and Nova half lying
across the body of Taylor watches the scene with an
expression of wild and pitiable bewilderment

The image of the ruined city fades gradually and so does
the noise of yelling humans and shrieking apes

A fresh noise begins which grows louder until we recognise
the sound of children laughing and clapping

The smoke screen clears suddenly and shows a circus arena
illwiinated by spotlights The benches are full of a
happy audience nearly all of them are children

Three oranz-utans are in the arena and a young voman is
introducing them They are iaximus and the tvo collcasucs
of Zaius They are Gressed in ridiculous clothes (as ans
are nowadeys in the circus) Their movements are conpictdy
ane-Like Accompanied by applause we watch them go throuzh
tne usual rontine of a chimpanzee tea party All perforued
with the awiiwardness of aninals dressed up

The audience applaud Their trainer sives each of then and
lump of sugar Apparently satisfied they sit on a ben¢ch
and stay there

The Trainer (female)

And now ladies and gentlemen I have

the pleasure of presenting the greatest
attraction of the century the most knowing
ape of his century I mean the celebrated
zaius
- 108 -

Music The curtains open and Zaius makes his entrance
He is wearing a black dress-coat looking very ridiculous
and on his head sits a top hat Ne is smoking a large
cigar He steps forward with a waddling gait reaches
the middle of the arena removes his cigar and bows to
the crowd Thunderous applause

The Trainer

This ape ladies and gentlemen and
this one in particular has innumerable
talents - he can actually pronounce a
few words Now tell this honoured
audience your name

Silence Then Zaius opens his mouth and makes a visible
effort but he only manages a sort of grunt The trainer
gets angry and hits hin lightly with the whip she is
holding

The Trainer

He must be suffering from indigestion
He is in a bad mood He is sulking
gone on come on You are called

oo ZA oe

ZAIUS (with a terridie effort his
eyes rolling wildly)

Za Zaious

Thunderous applause Relieved the trainer comes up to

him gives him a playful tap on the nose then a lump of
sugar which he devours greedily

The applause continues Zaius looks around him in a
bewildered fashion alone now in the centre of the arena
Then slowly and with the irreguiar movements of a trained

ape he starts to applaud himself also The Screen fades
cut on this last picture
