A BLACK SCREEN

explodes in a beautiful display of fireworks It looks like
fireworks anyway but the patterns are too perfect too
symmetrical

While Frank Sinatra sings How Little We Know and the credits
roll the light show goes on And each time just before the
burst of color and beautifully patterned streaks two tiny dots
of light nothing more than little tingles at opposite ends of
the screen fly slowly toward one another and collide causing
all the beauty and chaos

What are these strange patterns What makes these tingles
intermingle Not even Francis knows

DISSOLVE TO
EXT COUNTRY ROAD DAY

A silver circle spins And keeps spinning on and on around
and around endless hypnotic A WOMANS VOICE comes over

VOICE (0S)
Einstein said The most
incomprehensible thing about the
universe is that it is comprehensible

Pulling back we realize the spinning circle is the shiny chrome
hubcap in the center of a tire

VOICE (OS) (cont‘d)
Hah Maybe to him

The tire is on a police car a cruiser zipping down a country
road as fast as it can lights flashing siren BLARING Door
says SPARKLE CREEK SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT

The car BLASTS past a big old John Deere tractor and barrels
down the country road

INT CAR DAY
The sheriff behind the wheel is KAREN KRAUTHAFER driving like a
maniac rocking back and forth pounding the wheel urging every

bit of power out of her car that she can possibly get

Determined Certain

JAN-29-2081 1556 96 P2
2 01092001

VOICE
Geez look at me Some hurry huh
Where am I headed Whats the rush
Whats so important You tell me

We drift into the car look closely at Karens face A slight
almost imperceptible ripple slithers through the image so faint
it could have been a mistake something wrong with the film
print -- but since we mentioned it here you know it wasnt

VOICE (0S) (CONT’D)
Einstein could understand the universe
but most of us cant even answer this
one simple question --

Suddenly Karen stops rocking sits up straight a confused look

crossing her brow She looks around tries to get her bearings
She speaks

KAREN
Where am I going

ABOVE THE CAR

the cruiser approaches a fork in the road a huge spreading oak
tree planted dead in the middle of it demanding a choice from
drivers right or left this is it make your decision

Karens cruiser slows to a crawl headed straight for the tree
and stops just short of it

INT CAR DAY

Karen just sits there at the wheel puzzled as can be not sure
which way to go Then suddenly for no apparent reason --

-- she bursts into tears Worse than tears horrible wracking
sobs of pain and loss

KAREN
(between sobs)
What is going on

Choking back the emotion she reaches for the radio keys the
microphone

KAREN (cont’ d)
Uh hey Owen

An officious dispatcher answers
3 01092003

OWEN (OS)
Go ahead Unit One Alpha Base reading
you five by five over

KAREN
Hey I know this is like a stupid
question and everything but uh
where am I going

A pause from the other end

OWEN
Say again Unit One Alpha Base is ten
six hundred your last transmission
over
KAREN

Owen talk normal Im serious Im
having a very weird moment here Im in
the car Ive got the --

(switches off the siren)
-- siren on cherries are popping and
all of a sudden Im -- well Im very
upset and I have no idea where Im
supposed to be going Did you send me
somewhere

OWEN (0S)
Nope Last I heard you were at
Stellpflugs ten fifteen minutes ago
Tom and Helen were goin at it pretty
good again

Wiping away tears she keys the radio again Trying to contain
her voice

KAREN
Ill call you back

She signs off hangs up the radio Takes a deep shuddery
breath trying to compose herself

KAREN (cont’ d)
This is ridiculous

She drops the car into gear cranks the tires to the right hits
the gas --

-- and SLAMS into a MAN ON A BICYCLE who has just hit a rock and
gone flying into the air and sailing over her hood He SMACKS
into the windshield ending up face to face with her
4 01092001

KAREN (cont’ d)
OH MY GOD

She whips off the eyeglasses she wears for driving leaps out of
the car --

EXT COUNTRY ROAD DAY

-- and runs around the door to help HOWARD HEYWOOD the
unfortunate man who is peeling himself off her windshield

KAREN
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT

Howard rolls over toward her now lying on his back on the hood
of the car his head against the windshield Hes had the wind
knocked out of him but seems otherwise uninjured

KAREN (cont’ d)
WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR

He turns looks at her blinking disoriented He sits up
Takes a look around to get his bearings Looks back at her

HOWARD
I was meeting someone I think

Suddenly a wave of emotion passes over his face he sits up
fighting back tears Embarrassed he turns slightly away hides
his face in his hands

KAREN
Whats the matter sir

His shoulders heave he takes a deep breath turns toward her
His cheeks are stained with tears

HOWARD
I wish I knew

He slides off the hood of the car embarrassed He picks up his
bike and starts walking away past her down the left fork of
the road limping slightly

She calls after hin

KAREN
What the heck just happened here

EOWARD
I dont have a clue
5 01092001

And he continues away down the road She shakes her head puts
her driving glasses back on gets back in the car and heads
off down the right fork

Rising up above the big old tree thats planted in the heart of
the V we watch as Howard and Karen head off in opposite
directions Separate Alone

CUT TO
EXT KARENS FATHERS HOUSE DAY

Karen parks her squad car in front of a modest house A
contractors truck is in the drive Next to the contractors
truck is a second contractors truck identical in every way
but maybe a year or two newer

Karen isnt in the mood to see it
INT KARENS FATHERS HOUSE DAY

Karen enters the kitchen Her father MITCH a barrel-chested
man in his mid-sixties is stacking beers in the fridge He
glances at a clock on the wall

MITCH
Cutting it kinda close arent you
Kick offs in three minutes

KAREN
You didnt tell me you were having
people over

MITCH
Just Bob and the Germaines

KAREN
Just Bob and the Germaines

Karen looks at a package of sausages on the counter

KAREN (cont’ d)
On your certificate under cause of
death Im writing suicide by tube
steak

MITCH
Theyre just brats They cook down to
almost nothing
6 01092001

MITCH

new season we dont know the status of
Dorseys ankle theres Bretts thumb

KAREN
Does everything revolve around the
Packers

MITCH

Oh yes Even the sun

Karen smiles turns and looks out on the patio at the source of
a hot SIZZLING sound

ON THE PATIO

she sees BOB KUGELMAS JR Karens age engulfed in a cloud of
barbecue smoke as he tends the grill Big solid chunk of a guy

He sees her waves Taps his watch meaningfully

BOB
Two minutes

KAREN

(sighs)
Im gonna take a shower

INT BATHROOM DAY

Karen is in the shower rinsing shampoo out of her hair She
looks down sees the water swirling down the drain

She cocks her head Is something funny about that

She bends down hugs her knees to her chest and stares at it
The water is swirling clockwise
y

7 01092001

Clockwise is like it always does right

INT MITCHS HOUSE DAY

Karen has changed into cutoffs and a T-shirt She stops at the
door to the family room and looks inside Her father Bob
Kugelmas and the Germaines BOOTS and CAROL a sixty-something
couple in pressed jeans and Green Bay Packer sweatshirts are
sitting at a semi-circle of TV trays set up in front of the set

An empty one waits for her a plate of cooked sausage and a beer
sitting on it She cant bring herself to sit there

ON THE TV

Brett Favre scrambles for his life and tosses an underhand
shovel pass to Dorsey Levens who limps around left end for two
and a half

IN THE LIVING ROOM

BOB
Ankles still bothering Dorsey

MITCE
Pulling guard dogged it

BOB
The guard didnt matter outside

song)
“And the farmer hauled another load

They all laugh for some reason
CAROL

KAREN

Hey Bob cmere a sec
9 01092001

Karen walks off Bob gets up to follow glancing back at the set
apprehensively Mitch and Boots lean all the way to the right
to keep a clear view of the TV then as Bob and Karen pass in
front of them they snap back to the left

IN THE HALLWAY

Karen pulls Bob aside

KAREN (cont’d)
Do you wanna go for a walk

BOB

KAREN

A collective GROAN comes from the other room further increasing
Bobs anxiety

BOB (contd)

Karen touches his cheek The poor bastard

KAREN

10 01092001

Bob darts back into the room like a little kid back into the
swimming pool

Cur To

ExT ROAD INTO TOWN DUSK

Karen walks down her fathers street headed toward a cluster of
buildings at the far end the village of Sparkle Creek pop
2626 The sun has set but the sky is dark blue with late
summer light All along the road into town the eerie white
flickering light of television sets spills from the living room
windows of every single house

Games on and everybodys watching We can hear it too
through the open windows echoing down the deserted streets

A HEAVY GUY hurries past Karen carrying a brown paper bag
fresh beer and chips inside Hes walking as fast as his legs
will carry him his face creased with profound concern

KAREN
Hey Tommy

TOM
Ankles still bothering Dorsey

And he keeps moving Karen sighs These are my people
Up ahead is ‘an ice cream stand She heads for it
EXT ICE CREAM STAND DUSK

Karen is at the window of the ice cream stand being waited on
by a TEENAGE GIRL with a vertical wall of teased bangs

KAREN
Mint chip on a sugar cone

Karen takes a look around while the girl goes off to fill her
order

Aman sits at one of the picnic tables bent over a black and
white composition book He writes furiously with great
excitement Sensing Karens presence he turns Its Howard
Heywood

KAREN (cont d)
The idiot on the bike
ii

01092001

It takes him a moment to recognize Karen with her being out of

uniform and all but when he does --

HOWARD

The maniac cop

KAREN

Youre the one who shot out in front of

me
HOWARD

Did I Its kind of a blur
KAREN

You probably have a head injury
HOWARD

Im fine
KAREN

You seem a little out of it

HOWARD
Im like that

Glancing at his notebook Karen sees a page crammed with

indecipherable equations

TEENAGE GIRL
Single mint chip

Karen gets her cone and carries it to a picnic table where she

sits down

Howard tries to get back to whatever it is he was
eyes are drawn to Karen He watches as she takes
her cone She makes a face Takes another lick

There are all different ways people fall-in love
its after years of acquaintance Sometimes its
terrible crisis In Howard Heywoods case after
glimpse of Karen eating ice cream hes a goner

From the houses up and down the block there is a
CHEER fram those watching the game

Karen turns to Howard holds out her cone

KAREN
Taste this
(he hesitates)
(MORE)

doing but his
a lick from

Sometimes
during a
a four second

collective
12 01092001

KAREN (cont’ d)

Go on
he takes a lick)
Does it taste funny to you

BROWARD
Not really

But as soon as she looks away Howard makes a face It DID
taste funny He flips open his notebook and makes some quick
surreptitious jottings We bend down peer over his shoulder
but he SNAPS the book shut just before we can see

Karen tries her cone once more

KAREN
Definitely off

She flips the cone into a trash can

KAREN (cont’ d)
See you around --

HOWARD
Howard
KAREN
Later Howard
CUT TO
EXT MAIN STREET DUSK

catches up to her on his creaky bicycle

HOWARD

He dismounts walks the bike

KAREN

KAREN
I never did understand exactly what it
is you people do up there

HOWARD
Ceramic réd for mag-lev applications
KAREN
Still dont Which way does water
swirl down the drain

HOWARD
Counter-clockwise in this hemisphere
Clockwise in the south

KAREN
Are you sure

BROWARD
I am absolutely positive I got it
wrong on a test once

KAREN
And you never make the same mistakes
twice

HOWARD
That would be illogical Captain

KAREN
Well Mr Spock its my specialty I
divorced the same guy twice and now Im
sorta engaged to him again

HOWARD
(hopeful)
Sort of

KAREN
Its not like I dont have a choice I
have two -- go forward or backward
But both choices are identical

HOWARD
Where K equals Karen KX0 and K-xX0

KAREN
And X is Bob Kugelmas Jr

HOWARD
If thats the name of your ex
14 01092001

They look at

KAREN

zero

HOWARD

KAREN

HOWARD
So if you married him a third time

Kugelmas Kugelmas

KAREN

HOWARD

time At the plant I mean Big
night we might be on the verge of a
kind of breakthrough

KAREN
What is it you people do up there

HOWARD
Ceramic réd for-

KAREN
Just yankin ya Howard

each other He has made her smile

HOWARD
Nice talking to you

KAREN

Bob watches Karen go A thought makes her turn back

KAREN (cont’ d)
Did you remember who you were looking
for

HOWARD
Hom
15 01092001

KAREN
After I hit you you said you were
looking for someone

Theyre walking backwards away from each other the space
between growing larger so they raise their voices
BROWARD
(remembering)
Yeah Huh I dont even know

KAREN
Couldnt have been too important

HOWARD
I hope not

They turn and walk away from each other opposite directions on
the street Up and down the block a collective AWWWW of
disappointment comes from the houses

CUT TO
EXT HIGH ABOVE SPARKLE CREEK DUSK
As the last of the sun disappears over the horizon were high
over the town In the distance we can see the creek that gives
the town its name This place couldnt be lovelier
Faintly (or is it our imagination) a low HUM rises up on the
soundtrack Gets a little higher pitched Like something
accelerating But its quiet barely there
The image quivers
EXT FIELD DUSK

A cow in a field A strange cow a cow turning in a circle

Rising up above the cow we see ten more cows Also turning in
circles

Even higher a total of fifty cows all turning around and
around in circles in the middle of the field

Counterclockwise for the record
16 01092001

INT MITCHS HOUSE NIGHT

Karen has dutifully taken her seat in front of the television
set The others are all in a bad mood Game isnt going very
well

BOOTS
(singing again)
Turn out the lights

BOB
Not necessarily

BOOTS
The partys over

BOB
Two touchdowns and a field goal

MITCH
(shaking an empty beer can)
Carol you up

CAROL
I am not up
BOB
Two touchdowns and a field goal
BOOTS
Dreeeeeeam dream dream dream dream
dreeeeeean
BOB

Could be two touchdowns two two point
conversions and a safety could be
that

Mitch shifts holding his beer can out to Karen

MITCH
Karen you up

Karen buries her face in her hands If shes lucky she will
die soon

A weird shudder passes through the screen a rivple just like
the one we saw in the opening Mitch repeats the words he just
said in the way he just said then
17 01092001

MITCH (cont d)
Karen you up

Exactly as she did before Karen buries her face in her hands

That was weird Didnt anybody notice But theres no time to
think about it because --

Ted Koppels face streaks through the room

TED KOPPEL
- to which Mr Putin replied with a
curt Not interested
Its a strange elongated version of Mr Koppel like a narrow
stretched out beam of Koppel and it comes right through the
front wall slices through the living room and exits the back
wall

Pause
Silence for a moment

CAROL
Thats funny Ted Koppels not on till
ten

A horse race gallops through the roam

ANNOUNCER
Its Mother of Pearl and Lucky Dan
Lucky Dan and Mother of Pearl Mother
of Pearl and woah Nelly here comes
China Dog

Again its weird streaky it comes right through the walls
this time bounces around off the light fixtures before
disappearing up through the ceiling

Panic strikes Which means basically everybody stands up and
looks at each other

Mitch walks over to the TV set and stares at it hands on hips
Be bends down and SMACKS it on the side

All hell breaks loose
Those strange elongated rays zap through the wall in a hundred

different spots bouncing crazily around the room through
people walls furniture you name it
18 01092001

A cacophony fills the room a million different sounds ali
played at once

Karen and the others grab their ears slam their eyes shut and
lunge toward the door to get the hell out of there

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Its even worse outside TOWNSFOLK pour out of their houses and
stagger into a blizzard of sight and sound as if all radio and

television waves suddenly have become visible (which is exactly

what happened)

Karen gropes her way toward the squad car but takes a wrong
turn in the maelstrom and bumps into the neighbors house She
looks through a window --

INTO THE NEIGHBORS KITCHEN

where she sees a MAN and WOMAN wrestling with a microwave oven
trying to get close enough to shut it off because the thing
looks like an electronic porcupine spitting freaky glowing
waves in all directions

Karen ducks ends up falling over backwards as the waves pierce
the walls of the house wash out into the night right over her
head

She lands on her back on the grass looking up at the stars in
the sky Well she would be looking at the stars instead what
shes looking at is

A CYLINDER OF CHAOS

bouncing and waving and emanating and glowing and piercing its
way straight up into the sky as far as the eye can see

BIGH OVER THE TOWN

the same shot we saw before we get a good perspective on the
tower of chaos and we notice the truly strange thing about it

Its in a perfect circle around the town A cylinder if you
want to be 3D about it that rises straight up over the town and
seems to have no top

Outside the circle -- unspoiled Wisconsin natural beauty

Inside the circle where the town is -- a technological hell

CUT TO
(o

19 01092001

INT KARENS SQUAD CAR NIGHT

Karen who has managed to find her way into her squad car is
driving through the mess with her windshield wipers on for
some reason

She reaches down picks up the handset and flicks on the radio
but the moment she does it is as if a swarm of white flashing
killer bees leap out of the receiver and attack her

These killer bees are called static

Raren SCREAMS and flips it off which settles the static
problem but all around her the night air is still filled with
noise and strobing light

Suddenly a WHITE VAN streaks across her field of vision (a real
white van) so close that she has to swerve hard to the right

WHAM

Karen has reached the sheriffs office She slams forward
bounces her head off the wheel THUNKS it into park

EXT SHERIFFS OFFICE NIGHT

Karen climbs out of the car which she has driven directly into
the wall of the sheriffs office She looks around sees the
tail lights of the white van disappearing around a corner
barely visible through the din

She fights her way toward the door
INT SHERIFFS OFFICE NIGHT

Karen BANGS through the door of the sheriffs office OWEN a
seventeen year old kid in a Wu Tang Clan tee-shirt is sitting
at the dispatchers desk chair turned toward the television
hands clamped over his ears still trying to watch the game

Karen and Owen have to scream to be heard over the furious sound
blasting through the office

KAREN
OWEN

OWEN
THEYRE GOING FOR IT ON FOURTH AND
THREE
20 01092001

KAREN
OWEN

OWEN
HOLY GOD THEYRE RUNNING IT

Karen takes a deep breath SCREAMS at the top of her lungs

KAREN
OWEN

This is the exact moment at which it all stops The room
immediately returns to normal From the television set in the
normal manner

ANNOUNCER
First down

Owen claps turns to face Karen

OWEN
Wha sup
KAREN
It stopped
OWEN
(motioning with a twirl of his
finger)

You mean the thing

KAREN
Yeah Owen the thing

OWEN
Hey whats the story with that

BAM Karen opens a locker takes out a hat and gun belt
CcuT TO

EXT MAIN STREET NIGHT

Now wearing the hat and gun belt but still in her cutoffs and
tee shirt Karen comes into the street which is rapidly
emptying of people who are all headed back into their houses
with some urgency Games still on
Com

21 01092001

Karen looks around At the end of the street she sees that
white van again streaking out the mouth of an alley and
disappearing into another alley She jumps in the squad car and
follows

EXT ALLEY NIGHT

Karen watches the van pull out of the alley and into the center
of the town square where it parks behind a statue of a general
on a horse

FOUR TECHNICIANS in biohazard suits climb out Two carry
armored brief cases the other two crowbars They check to
make sure the coast is clear and split off in four different
directions

Karen slips out of her car and watches from the shadow of a
building

IN THE SQUARE

the Technicians with crowbars pry open manhole covers on
opposite sides of the square The other two snap open their
armored cases Commands are quickly entered on miniature
keypads

Two monitoring devices emerge pneumatically from the manholes
each with a rotating satellite dish and a cluster of clear
lenses arrayed in a sphere

The Technicians with crowbars begin collecting samples -- water
from the fountain a spade full of soil A frightened squirrel
is netted and dropped in a cage

More commands are entered The monitoring devices begin to HUM
and the lens cluster spins rapidly The Technicians put on
thick goggles with amber glass

A sharp beam of white light fires between the monitoring
devices rises into an arc then rapidly cuts across the sky in
millisecond slices of light

IN THE ALLEY

Karens jaw drops as the brilliant light reflects off her face
IN THE SQUARE

the briefcases SNAP shut the monitoring devices WHIR back into
the ground the manhole covers BANG back into place
22 01092001

The four Technicians slip off their goggles and head back to the
van heads swiveling making certain they werent seen They
slip into the van BANG the doors shut one after the other

The Driver starts it up hits the headlights --

-- and sees Karep standing in the street in front of them She
points to the badge on her hat walks around to the drivers
window and signals for him to roll it down

He does

KAREN
Would you like to tell me what it is
you think youre doing

The Driver turns looks at the other Technicians they MUTTER
among themselves He turns back to Karen with a carefully
considered response

DRIVER
Were with the cable company

KAREN
Okay Im gonna need you to go ahead
and hop out of the van

Even though shes wearing her gun belt her cutoffs and T-shirt
dont inspire a great deal of respect The Technicians confer
once again then the Driver turns back looks right at her --

-- and hits the gas Karen watches gobsmacked as the van hauls
away She reaches for her gun -- but what Shes going to
shoot them

KAREN (cont’ d)
You little weasels

EXT ROAD OUT OF TOWN NIGHT

Driving now Karen catches up with the van a mile or so out of
town She turns on her warning lights but the van keeps going
She BLOOPS the siren but the van just lumbers along at a steady
OJ on the run kind of pace

She picks up her radio
KAREN

Im heading West on County K in pursuit
of a white van license 2ZEO54
23 01092003

OWEN (0S)
Do you need back-up Over
KAREN

OWEN (0S)
Thats a negative Over
KAREN
So what do you think Owen
EXT TEKCOM NIGHT

The white van pulls up to the security gate of an industrial
park of long and low mirrored glass buildings Karen follows
close behind lights still flashing

The gate opens and the van pulls through but the gate drops
fast right in front of the squad car Karen hits the brakes
and SCREECHES to a halt

She leaps out furious to confront the GUARD in the shack

GUARD
Woah woah woah where do you think
youre goin there Tex

KAREN
Do you see the lights Do you hear
the siren

The Guard checks out her outfit

GUARD
Dont you think youd better get that
car back before somebody notices its

KAREN

of four suspects in that white van
And if you call me Tex one more time
I will cuff you till you bleed

GUARD

24 01092001

MOMENTS LATER

the Guard is in the back of the squad car hands zip-tied to the
cage between the front and back seats

GUARD

KAREN
Close enough Tiger

VOICE (0S)
Say now whats the kerfuffle

Karen turns and sees a man in a suit coming down the driveway
carrying a briefcase a big goofy smile on his face JERRY
CORNDELLs looks fall somewhere between personable and smarny

KAREN
Who are you

JERRY CORNDELL
Jerry Corndell head of public
relations for TekCom Happened to be

huzzarei What seems to be the
problem

KAREN
Quite a few problems Jerry And I
think you guys are the ones causing
them

JERRY CORNDELL
Oh you mean before That was nothing
that was just our boys doing a simple
alpha test of some new equipment And
I believe their official score on that
test was whoops-a-daisy

KAREN —
Sorses ran through our living room

JERRY CORNDELL
You know how when youre listening to
the radio and they say we now
interrupt this program for a test from
the Emergency Broadcast System and you
hear all that static Same thing

microwaves might have gone a smidge

KAREN
Your smile lines get very twitchy when
you lie Jerry

JERRY CORNDELL
(bending down and looking in
the car)
Rupert what in the sweet name of Curly
Lambeau did you do to get yourself
arrested

KAREN
Rupert failed to show respect for the
badge As did the driver of a white
van that just pulled through your
gates I was questioning him when he
drove off then failed to stop for the
lights and siren He went up the hill
and into your facility there

JERRY CORNDELL
That is one hundred percent out of

KAREN

Jerry Corndell stops looks at Rupert who is nibbling at the
plastic zip ties around his wrists He looks back at Karen
Then picks up the phone in the guard shack and punches a three-
digit number

Int TEKCOM LOBBY NIGET
Karen and Jerry Corndell sit in two tiny chairs in the vast
TekCom lobby mostly dark at this hour Two hallways stretch
off into darkness on either side of a reception desk
Jerry Corndell picks up a small tray and holds it out to Karen

JERRY CORNDELL
Johnny Cake

She looks down There are a dozen small lemon cakes wrapped in
plastic on the tray

27 01092001

KAREN
No thank you

Jerry sets the tray down on the table between them They wait
In the distance they hear shoes CLICKING on the floor of the
hall Somebodys coming

Karen starts to stand up Jerry motions her to sit down --
youve got plenty of time

Karen sits The CLICKING goes on Doesnt really get much
louder just CLICK CLICK CLICK as somebody keeps walking There
as a tiny increase in the volume of the clicking

Karen starts to stand Jerry shakes his head Karen sits
The clicking goes on This place is huge

Karen hears a SQUEAKING sound She looks down Jerry is
sliding the tray of Johnny Cakes toward her She scowls shakes
her head Jerry shrugs

The CLICKING gets louder still Jerry stands buttons his coat
motions -- up up

Karen stands and looks toward the mouth of the hallway

Howard Heywood steps out from the back Karen is stunned Sos
he But then he breaks out into an enormous smile

HOWARD
Hey Can you keep a secret

Before Karen can answer Jerry Corndell practically leaps
between then

JERRY CORNDELL
Uh scuse me just one second there
Dr Heywood I wonder if I might just
tug on your sleeve for uno segundo

He hauls Howard off to the side out of Karens earshot

JERRY CORNDELL (cont’ d)
Just exactly what is it you intend to
do vis a vis our young visitor here
sir

HOWARD
Come on Jerry that woman is smart
And shes curious

HOWARD (contd)
We send her away now shell show up
tomorrow with a search warrant and a
video crew

JERRY CORNDELL
Youre not suggesting
HOWARD
Im gonna show her Big Rick

INT CORRIDOR NIGET

Howard leads Karen down one of those impossibly long corridors
Theyre silent except for the sound of his shoes CLICKING and
her sneakers SQUEAKING Jerry Corndell is trotting alongside
with a stack of release forms on a clipboard flipping the aside
one after the other as Karen signs then

JERRY CORNDELL
Sign here initial here just
there one more radiation
waiver there there and there
(whips out a small ink pad)
A thumbprint here

Karen looks over at Howard wondering what shes getting into
As they walk toward a set of elevator doors in the remote
distance --

DISSOLVE TO

-- the far end of the hall They finally reach the double
doors an elevator

Howard slides in a key card and a panel opens revealing another
set of doors these made of glass Howard keys again and they
WHOOSEH open

They step inside and turn around to face the front

Why is there an elevator in a one story

building

POW Their heads disappear as the elevator rockets down into
the earth

EXT TEKCOM NIGHT

The high pitched WHINE of the turbo-charged elevator carries
over to a shot of the outside of the TekCom complex situated on
a low rise from which it overlooks the town of Sparkle Creek

Inspired by the elevator we begin to descend ourselves down
the outside of the building down to ground level --

-- and then below ground level down through the grass down
through the dirt down through the roots and rocks and rodents
and stuff far below ground where mother natures browns and
grays and blacks abruptly give way to --

INT BIG RICK LAB NIGHT
- SPARKLING WHITE

We settle into an underground laboratory complex of staggering
dimension The main room Big Ricks lab is an enormous
underground cavern filled with complicated scientific equipment
and lit by hanging fluorescent lights A STAFF OF FORTY same
dressed in lab coats others dressed in shorts and Hawaiian
shirts moves briskly about tending to the equipment
conferring with one another monitoring the streams of data that
pour across the massive wall current monitor screens that line
the walls

Theres a makeshift basketball court built in one corner of the
lab and a game of three-onthree is underway an interesting
game in that none of the SCIENTISTS ever seems to make a shot
or really get all that close to the rim except for the seven
foot AFRICAN MAN who dunks with great rapidity

At either end of the lab an endless tunnel curves off into
infinity the tunnel on the right arcing to the left and the
left to the right They must meet at some point miles away

As we finally settle down to floor level we find Howard and
Karen in the foreground dwarfed the roof of the cavern five
stories over their heads Karen looks at Howard tries to form
words

KAREN
This is Big Rick

HOWARD
Sort of This is like Big Ricks head
Cmere
30 01092001

He leads her across the lab to the great surprise of everyone
they pass Dont get a lot of visitors in the lab Karen
cranes her neck taking it all in They pass a massive
excavating machine with three rotating heads each the size of a
mini-van Explains the tunnels

Against the far wall of the room there is an enormous suspended
Plexiglas tube a dozen feet in diameter which curves off into
the mouth of the two tunnels at each end There is a huge
control deck nestled up alongside the side of the tube and a
tall flight of stairs leading up to it

Howard leads Karen up the flight of stairs Theres a huge
Swivel chair at the top its enormous back is to us

ON THE CONTROL DECK

Howard leads Karen to the edge of the control deck jammed with
thousands of dials switches and slidey bars Two WELDERS in
silver heatproof suits work on the wiring above bathed in a
shower of sparks

HOWARD
This is Big Rick

From this vantage point Karen can look up and down the curving
tunnels in both directions The tubes are lined by rows of
massive magnets and all the wiring piping and scaffolding
needed to support them

KAREN
What is Rick

HOWARD
An acronym Stands for Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider

KAREN
What is it

HOWARD
Also called a superconducting
supercollider Its just a particle
accelerator when you get down to it

Karen nods thinking Finally

KAREN
What is it
31 01092001

VOICE (0S)
Its a hole in the ground

HOWARD
Conrad

The big black chair spins around revealing CONRAD DAVIES a big
pasty man who hasnt seen the sun in years

CONRAD
Well it is

HOWARD
Conrad co-authored Limits on the
Neutral Penetrating States in a Beam
Dump

KAREN
Huh

CONRAD
Its a tunnel Twenty-six miles in
circumference It encircles the entire
town

HOWARD
Remember five or six years ago when the
Department of Natural Resources said
they had to do all that digging to
redirect an underground river that was
polluting the water table

KAREN
That was you

CONRAD
That was us

BOWARD

Had to keep the whole thing on the QT
the President funded us through a
Department of Energy slush fund Cant
do pure science by committee

KAREN
What kind of science
HOWARD
(like a kid)

Well
(MORE)
32 01092001

BOWARD (cont’d)
The tunnels got two concentric rings
ef five thousand superconducting
electromagnets wrapped in titanium
wire supercooled with liquid helium --

KAREN
You-say super a lot

HOWARD
-- to near absolute zero

KAREN
And why would a boy build something
like that

CONRAD
So we can smash stuff together
(of course)

KAREN
What happens inside the tunnel

HOWARD
Well Pretend youre the nucleus of an
atom of gold

He takes her hand and leans her forward so she can look down
the tunnel as far as she can see Its a dizzying perspective

KAREN
What are you gonna do to me

HOWARD
Were gonna strip you of your electrons
and launch you into the tunnel

KA-BOOM
TAKING THE GOLD ATOMS PERSPECTIVE

we take off down the tunnel Howard talks over his voice
SHOUTING over the sound of our rapid acceleration

HOWARD (0S)
DESPERATE FOR AN ELECTRICAL CHARGE AND
PULLED ALONG BY THE ELECTROMAGNETS YOU
ACCELERATE DOWN THE TUNNEL AT 99998
PERCENT THE SPEED OF LIGHT

Our speed increases the magnets whipping by ZIPPING and
BUZZING as we enjoy the exhilarating blinding speed
(om

33 01092001

IN THE LAB
Conrad interrupts prideful

CONRAD
There are other accelerators around
but theyve only been able to get up to
99995 percent

HOWARD
You know that one they got out at
Brookhaven on Long Island Only got a
four mile circumference

CONRAD
We call that one Little Ricky

HOWARD
Anyhoo

BACK IN THE SIMULATION
were flying along again and Howard is SHOUTING over the sound

BROWARD
SO THERE YOU ARE FLYING ALONG AT NEAR-
LIGHT SPEED AND EVERYTHINGS GREAT FOR
A WHILE BUT WHAT YOU DONT KNOW IS
THAT WE FIRED A SECOND GOLD NUCLEUS
FROM THE OTHER END OF THE TUNNEL AND
ITS HEADED STRAIGHT FOR YOU

HIGH ABOVE THE TOWN

were looking down on Sparkle Creek at dusk Two faint points
of light glowing underground are circling around the perimeter
of the town headed straight toward one another The WHINE of
their respective accelerations continues to build

IN THE SIMULATION

we can see the approaching gold nucleus headed straight for us
in slow-motion

HOWARD (0S)
SUDDENLY FOR A DURATION OF TEN TO THE
NEGATIVE TWENTY-FOURTE OF A SECOND AND
AT A TEMPERATURE HOTTER THAN THE
SURFACE OF THE SUN YOU SMASH
TOGETHER
34 01092001

Slow-motion turns to sickeningly fast motion we collide with
the approaching gold nucleus We explode the two of us into a
brilliant beautiful peaceful shower of infinitesimal
particulate matter

BACK IN THE LAB-

the image of the disintegrating nuclei is playing on a giant”
display screen over the control panel

HOWARD
(enraptured)
And in that moment we have it

Pulling back we see the same image is now on screens all over
the lab

HOWARD (cont’ d)
Captured for our perusal on twenty-four
wall current display screens We have
it

KAREN
Have what

He looks at her completely puzzled as if no question could
come from further out in left field Realizing shes not

kidding

HOWARD
Quark gluon soup

KAREN
A quart of glue soup

HOWARD
Quark gluon soup Up gluons down
gluons muons prions gravitons the
works the juice the goop the star
stuff we are made of a state that
hasnt existed since the instant after
the Big Bang when all matter floated
in suspension at a trillion degrees
Fahrenheit The origin of the
universe the moment of creation

He looks back up at the screens So does she not daring to
break his mood

KAREN
Thats what happened tonight
(om

35 01092001

HOWARD
Tonight was a mistake
CONRAD
My bad All me
BROWARD
Some housing on the niobium wires was
stripped sending out energy into the
UV spectra which as you know is
normally visible only from four to
eight hundred angstroms but tonight
ba broadened its aural and visual activity
all the way down to zero and up to nine
hundred I see said the blind man as

he picked up the hammer and twenty
micron caliper

Everyone around them GUFFAWS inexplicably

Karen raises an eyebrow Howard quieting the group holds out
a hand reassuringly

HOWARD (cont’d)
But its okay now In terms of energy
it was like a mosquito hitting a screen
door Wont happen again

KAREN
Youre sure about that

HOWARD
Well I um I tend to be pretty
right about things

KAREN
But you could be wrong

HOWARD
I dont think I an

KAREN
It sounds to me like youve surrounded
Sparkle Creek and its three thousand
unsuspecting residents with an
experimental device which you cant
control
36 01092001

HOWARD
Oh come on Did you know that before
they tested the first atom bomb there
was a substantial group of scientists
who actually believed the blast would
ignite the entire atmosphere

7 KAREN
And look how well nuclear weapons
turned out

HOWARD
Im not reassuring you am I
KAREN
My job is to be concerned with public
safety
HOWARD

Everyones safe Youre safe

KAREN
Whether were safe or not you have a
responsibility to tell the town These
people have a right to know

Karen SCREAMS he pulls her around in his powerful arms and her
screams turn to giggles as he flips her over onto his lap and
tickles her

the Undersecretary stops at a table with two big urns of coffee
and many plates of Johnny Cakes He takes a cup and a cake

RT THE FRONT

Jerry Corndell walks to a table picks up a sheaf of papers and
hands them to Conrad

JERRY CORNDELL
Dr Conrad Davies here is the director
of our superconducting magnet division
Hes going to hand out a schedule of
when we plan to do our experiments
Although we don’t foresee any more of
the unforeseen we want you to be
ready Also to be on the safe side of
small town USA youll be given an
interference kit which consists of
this --

He opens a square box and takes out a Green Bay Packer helmet
lined with aluminum foil

JERRY CORNDELL (cont’d)
-- and enough aluminum foil from the
good folks at Reynolds Wrap to line all
the south-facing windows of your hames
So check the schedule put on your
helmet line your windows and doors
and youre good as gold Thanks for
comin folks

He turns and starts packing up but there are disgruntled
MUMBLINGS from the crowd behind him

Howard who is hovering near the edge of the stage takes Jerry
by the arm

HOWARD
What are you doing These people have
questions at least let me answer same
of them

40 01092001

I don’t need you getting us in any more
trouble than we already are I11
handle the questions
‘HOWARD
You feel confident with the physics

JERRY CORNDELL
This ain’t about physics my friend
this is about throwing a bucket of
water on the fire of idiocy that rages
inside the head of John Q Lunchpail

He picks up a yellow cushball and heads back to the microphone

JERRY CORNDELL (cont’d)
Now its your turn I’m going to throw
this cushball into the crowd and
whoever catches it asks a question or
makes a comment Then that person
throws it to another person Got it
Let’s go

Jerry chucks the ball into the crowd It caroms off the head of
somebody who wasnt looking and hits an old lady (MRS KNOEBEL)

in the face

MRS KNOEBEL
Oh

JERRY CORNDELL
Little help

Mitch Karens father who is sitting next to her bends down
and picks up the ball

MITCH
What if it isnt safe
HOWARD
Id like to take this one if I-

JERRY CORNDELL

(stepping on Howard’s comment)
If If If a frog had hip pockets
hed carry a gun

(he laughs no one else does)
Is it safe Safer than a Volvo
wagon in the slow lane Toss that
ball

Mitch shrugs and throws the cushball SOME LADY with a frosted
blonde perm catches it

SOME LADY
Is it important to buckle up the chin
strap when we put on the helmet

JERRY CORNDELL
Matter of individual taste and style
Next

She throws the ball Its caught by a guy in an ORANGE HAT

ORANGE HAT
What about ice fishing Are the lakes
still going to freeze over

JERRY CORNDELL
Thick as my head and twice as hard
Next

Orange Hat throws the ball A big hand reaches up and spears
it It belongs to Bob Kugelmas Jr He stands Hes big it

- takes him a while to reach his full height Karen is sitting

next to him

BOB
I got a question How do we know that
the next time you fire up that hog its
not gonna blow us all to smithereens
or burn up the planet or fire us off
into the ninth dimension

There is much murmured assent This is the question on
everyones minds Conrad leans into the microphone too close

(with feedback)
I believe the explosion scenario is the
least likely

This causes some consternation Jerry C elbows Conrad aside

JERRY CORNDELL
Did everyone get a Johnny Cake

BOB
Answer the question
42 01092001

JERRY CORNDELL
Look Im not saying we wont get our
hair mussed But we live in America
If we want to keep watching our big
screen TVs and filling our trucks with
dollar-a-gallon gas we gotta remain
first and best If we’re not at the
forefront of science were at the ass
end of everything Pardon my Swahili
This project is going to put Sparkle
Creek on the map You should all feel
proud You should feel all feel brave
You should all feel smart Now
throw that ball

There are CHEERS anc bursts of APPLAUSE which are picked up by

to sign checks and pass along papers
Now however it has moved to the right

Just hate to see people you care about
making themselves unhappy But its
not like theres anything I can do

(still writing)
Yep
KAREN
Why

He stops writing looks at her smiles broadly

HOWARD
My favorite question

« KAREN
No offense but whats any of this
got to do with the price of milk Why
do it

HOWARD

To know Why are we here Howd it
begin Whats it all mean Is there
one principle underlying every element
property and process in the knowable
universe Sheriff Krauthafer Kugelmas
Kugelmas I am on a quest for nothing
less than a Unified Theory of

Everything

KAREN
Theory of

HOWARD
Everything Theory of Everything

KAREN
Youre ambitious Ill give you that

HOWARD
Ive always liked to take things apart

KAREN
What if you cant put it back together

HOWARD

Thats not how the universe works

See we assume everything ends in

cataclysm because human life is tragic

People die Always thats why we

think of beginnings middles ends
(MORE)
49 01092001

HOWARD (contd)
But cosmic time doesnt march straight
forward the universe loops around and
around itself its buoyant it
inflates it expands and if it
tears it repairs itself Begins
life again

There are all different ways people fall in love This is hers
She looks at him eyes shining smiling at the childlike wonder
with which he can speak

KAREN
Promise me When you figure it all
out dont tell me

HOWARD
Youre not curious

KAREN
Sure But if you know how everything
is going to end youre not living
youre waiting The questions are what

the floor at the base of the rings flick their switches and
the giant hydraulics start to contract sucking the giant metal
ring forward

On the floor we see the giant ring CRUNCH forward slowly
through a well-worn path in the concrete This baby is heavy

the giant blue ring KA-BOOMS into place in the center of the
lab between two equally gigantic magnet rings Its settling
movement is so loud the entire lab trembles with its bassy
finality

SNAP SNAP SNAP-SNAPPITY-SNAP Workers flick huge metal
latches securing the detector in place

A Worker turns and SHOUTS up to the deck

DETECTOR IS UP

ON THE CONTROL DECK

Howard takes a deep breath Jerry C and the Undersecretary
step up onto the platform behind him All eyes are on him
Absolute silence in the lab Finally

HOWARD
Lets bang some stuff together
53 01092001

Conrad enters a sequence of commands on his keyboard then
stands and keys opens a metal box above him Inside there isa
giant lever with big red letters at the top that say ON and
big red letters at the bottom that say OFF

KAREN
You-have got to be kidding me

Howard casts a sheepish look around shrugs

HOWARD
More fun than pressing enter

CONRAD
And

He cranks the giant switch up into the ON position

CONRAD (cont’d)
We are in collider mode

Immediately there is a great WHOOSHING sound all around then
Karen looks concerned takes a step toward Howard

HOWARD
Water through the pipes Cooling

A steady BEEPING sound begins to echo from the walls

HOWARD (cont’d)

millirems of radiation in the
containment area

A loud electrical BUZZ comes from the wiring in and around the
detector

HOWARD (cont’d)

Conrad is entering commands furiously but on the monitors all
around them -- nothing

HOWARD
4to Karen)

You wont see anything yet Not till
the nuclei lose their electrons then
they get really hungry for electrical
charge so when theyre introduced to
1700 electromagnets theyre uh
interested

CONRAD
Stable

HOWARD
Start beam injection from the
Alternating Gradient Synchrotron

CONRAD
Use your words

HOWARD
(realizing)
Sorry Start beam injection please

CONRAD
Much better

He hits a command on his keyboard We dive in close to that key
and suddenly EXPLODE --

INTO THE TUNNEL

where were over the tubes this time flying along on top of
them the endless miles of white piping lined with cable and
tracking instruments racing below us at breakneck speed

Up ahead a bright red pipe merges in from the side like a
freeway on-ramp headed straight toward us and at the very
moment we pass over the intersection point we leap

INSIDE THE TUNNEL

where a bright red beam similar to a laser fires right through
the dead center of the magnetic tunnel stretching off into
infinity

Were POV gold nucleus caught up on the beam as we feed in
from the AGS tube and we blast around that ring almost as fast
as light itself
55 01092001

Up ahead we see the ring straightens out turns slightly to the
left and in that distance we see another beam this one blue
moving in the opposite direction

BACK ON TOP OF THE TUBE

we zoom ahead and see the massive blue curve of the detector
zing We pull up even higher pass over the detection ring and
look down inside it where the two white tubes both open end
revealing two thin transparent Plexiglas tubes that cross in an
X in the dead center of the detector ring

As we look down on it still moving toward it the blue beam and
the red beam collide right at the crotch of the X and as they
Collide we keep moving right down into them right down to

THE SUB-ATOMIC LEVEL

where we see a crazy fireworks show and now we finally
understand those images from the opening But these patterns
are wild haphazard not symmetrical in the least and pulling
back rapidly we realize were back in --

Int BIG RICK LAB DAY

the Big Rick lab and the collision we just saw on the sub-
atomic level is now displayed on the dozens of display screens
all over the walls

There is much GASPING did it work

CONRAD
Negative Negative Glancing blows
only

There are AWWWS of disappointment around the lab Karen turns
to Howard

KAREN
What happened

CONRAD
The molecules have to collide precisely
head to head Otherwise theres
nothing to read

EXT NEW HOUSE DAY
Mitch and Bob Kugelmas are in work clothes tool belts around
their waists pounding nails into the wood frame of a new house

theyre building at the edge of town No helmets and tin foil
for then

BAM BAM BAM The steady pounding of their hammers is
interrupted briefly as Bob glances at his watch sees what time
it is He shoots a worried look over at Mitch who just GRUNTS
dubious of the whole thing and goes back to POUNDING

CUT To
FROM A BLACK SCREEN
a tiny speck of light suddenly explodes into a perfect
symmetrical pattern every color in the rainbow shooting off
every which way Pulling back quickly we see were
IN THE BIG RICK LAB

and were seeing this on one of the dozen wall current monitors
all over the place

Conrad bolts up right out of his chair

57 01092002

CONRAD
WE HAVE BEAM ON BEAM COLLISIONS

A great CHEER rises up from the entire group in the lab Hugs
are exchanged fists pumped in the air Karen smiles taken in
by all the enthusiasm ‘

The Undersecretary looks almost disappointed

Howard is hugged repeatedly and high-fived’ He sees Karen
smiles
HOWARD
You gotta understand some of these
guys have been on this for almost
twenty years and this is it

Just as he did a moment ago Howard grabs her giddily

HOWARD (cont’d)
This is it

CONRAD
Stable data-taking mode

A slight almost imperceptible ripple shivers through the image
like the one we saw and (probably) dismissed in the opening

Howard grabs Karen giddy

HOWARD
This is it

CONRAD
Stable data-taking mode

It was like a visual hiccup and Howard noticed His face
wrinkles up in concern for a moment then he lunges toward a
tabletop and fumbles for a pen and paper on Conrads desktop

HOWARD
Something
CONRAD
(equally puzzled)
Yeah

Around them the display screens are really going crazy
collision after collision brilliant fireworks displays all over
the place
58 01092001

Howard scribbles quickly on the pad of paper a symbol and a
word

00 Loop

(That 00 is supposed to be the symbol for infinity a figure
eight on its side What kind of keyboard doesnt have the
symbol for infinity)

Howard is jostled as the two dozen Scientists rush back to their
monitors

Right in front of him somebody POPS a champagne cork Howard
drops the pen and watches as the cork flies across the room It
sails over the tubs and into the part of the laboratory that
is actually within the perimeter of the supercollider ring

The cork passes into the ring area bounces off the far wall --
-- and floats back out the way it came

But slowly Very slowly Violating several laws of nature
Howards the only one who noticed it

Be gets up from the table walks slowly across the lab ignoring
the frenzy and excitement all around him eyes fixed on the cork
as it drifts lazily through the air back to hin

Howard reaches the very edge of the ring circle The cork
drifts all the way out toward him and the moment it passes out
of the interior of the ring --

-- it drops to the floor at his feet with a soft little THUNK

He bends down and picks it up When he stands Karen is right
behind him big smile on her face

KAREN

Cool Howd you do that
HOWARD
KAREN

Oh no

But she wasnt talking to him she was noticing something behind
him Howard turns around following her gaze Within the ring

we see Boots looking down at us his face horrified Pulling
back we realize why -- his car is floating three feet in the

Boots SCREAMS

Int SUPERMARKET DAY

In the produce aisle of the supermarket fruits and vegetables
rise up into the air So do SHOPPERS and their carts

Mitch turns to see Bobs boots just passing him In fact
everything on the other side of the house is rising up past him
but everything on Mitchs side is still firmly on the ground

MITCH
Holy cheese in rice

Jumping up above them we see why this strange circumstance is
so - the house is built on the edge of town half of it inside
the rings curve half of it outside

EXT ABOVE THE TOWN DAY

Even higher up way high up above the town of Sparkle Creek we
get the big picture Everything inside the tunnels perimeter
is slowly floating up into the sky Everything around it is
completely normal This can only lead us to conclude

INT BIG RICK LAB DAY

HOWARD
Graviton theory is correct

The phones are RINGING off the hook there is much scurrying
back and forth its crisis mode in the lab but Howard seems
thrilled beyond belief

KAREN
What
61 01092001

HOWARD
(talking a mile a minute)

Theres a theory about specific
gravity that it isnt inherent to an
ebjects mass as we once thought but
based on tiny sub-atomic particles
called gravitons and I think weve
just proven it By sending electron-
free neutrinos into light-speed motion
around the ring we inadvertently
sucked all the gravitons within its

perimeter to the very edge which
caused-

Jerry Corndell SLAMS down a phone and finishes Howards
sentence

INT TEKCOM LOBBY DAY

Karen is about ten paces behind Jerry Corndell He races out
the hallway across the lobby of the building and blasts out
the door She follows

EXT TEKCOM DAY

Karen exits the building and sees Jerry Corndell heading toward
the parking lot but as he turns a corner he crosses over into
the interior of the ring --

-- and his pumping legs rise up off the ground He floats
around the corner and tumbles over the parking lot where a
hundred cars are floating away into the sky

Jerry C flaps his arms wildly manages to spin himself over
upside down and grabs hold of two big fistfuls of grass

Hes stuck there for a moment exactly upside down clinging to
the grass He SCREAMS

KAREN
Hold on Im going to help you

Karen still outside the ring still subject to the laws of
gravity searches frantically for something to help her save
Jerry Corndell

She runs to a flagpole unties the rope and starts stripping it
down

EXT MAIN STREET DAY

Those three Old Men are clinging to a clothesline hung up like
upside-down wash

Taking the long view down the street we see a dozen TOWNSFOLK
all upside-down all hanging onto road signs telephone poles
anything to keep them from floating away into space

hand

Corndell is clinging desperately to the grass Karen twirls the
rope and throws it A fraction of a second too late because --

RIP Jerry Corndells grass pulls out of the ground and he
starts to float away He SHRIEKS as he rises tumbling ass over
teakettle until he CRUNCHES into the very tip-top branches of a
tree and sticks there

rope around his waist and looks up into the sky

Bob Kugelmas Jr floats away above hin dangerously high in the
sky

MITCH
HOLD ON BOBBY IM COMIN

Mitch bends his knees steps over the edge of the ring and
leaps as high as he possibly can

Which is quite high considering theres no gravity He takes
off like a rocket blasting straight up into the sky toward Bob

On the ground the rope uncoils fast The other end is tied
securely to a joist It reaches the end of its play and pulls
taut just as --
AT THE END OF THE ROPE
-- Mitchs hand locks around Bobs ankle
Be holds on tight
FROM THE GROUND
we see both of them floating at the end of the rope a hundred
feet off the ground They start hauling themselves down hand
over hand as fast as they can

EXT TEKCOM DAY
Karen hurriedly fixes the end of her rope to a cinder block

Jerry Corndell is clinging to the branches at the top of the
tree by the very tips of his fingers

Karen hurls the block over the gravity border where the once
heavy object zings skyward like a balloon Karen grabs the
other end of the rope stopping its ascent and works to steer
it towards Jerry Corndell who looks relieved that help is on
the way

But then he sees something that makes his face go pale The
branches of the tree are waving
65 01092001

He looks up A group of nearby trees bend toward him bowing
before a strong wind

JERRY CORNDELL
Uh

The wind hits his tree twists him around the branches blow and
bend he loses his grip --

-- well drop to half light speed and

incrementally-

But the Undersecretary bulls right past him flips open the big

a hundred automobiles pile on top of one another in the TekCom
parking lot

The last to fall is her own and its headed straight for the
guard shack She leaps out at the last second and the car
flattens the shack like a pancake The siren SQUAWKS then
dies

Karen takes off running headed down the hill and into town

serpentining her way down the driveway as she dodges more
falling objects from the skies

EXT MAIN STREET DAY

As the last of whatever was up comes down Townspeople slowly
drag themselves to their feet and view their debris-strewn town

Some limp to the center of the street (Nearly everyone will
sport a limp sling or cast for the rest of the movie) They
stand there as the town once again grows quiet

Boots Germaine limps up to join the group Pause

A SCREAM rises up to deafening level coming from directly above
them They all look up see Jerry Corndells face at the top
of Jerry Corndells body which is rocketing down toward the
town at 128 feet per second

They all wince as Jerry Corndells scream is abruptly cut off as
his body disappears behind a row of storefronts and lands out of
sight with a discouraging thud They all turn back and look at
Boots again

EXT NEIGHBORS HOUSE DAY

A garage door opens and Karen backs out on a dirtbike that
survived the chaos She kicks it into gear and takes off down
the street

EXT ROAD INTO TOWN DAY

Driving fast Karen weaves the dirtbike through the littered
street People are jumping into wrecked cars trying to start
them up (which of course they cant)

So they grab the nearest bicycle hop aboard and head the hell
out of town This is real panic in the streets

We roll with TWO GUYS on bikes as they barrel down the road
headed toward the sign that says Welcome to Sparkle Creek

Just as they pass the sign --
-- they disappear

Not all at once but with a wipe their image erased just as
they cross the border out of town

FROM A HIGH ANGLE
69 01092001

we see a half-dozen PEOPLE behind them some on foot still
racing toward the edge of town They slam on the brakes
stopping just short of the border at the edge of town

ankles

Additionally an oversight and review

committee will be brought in to assess
damages and determine compensation

BOB

missing Where the hell are they

UNDERSECRETARY
Its too early to assume that the
people missing have anything to do with
what went wrong with the experiment

BOB
Yeah crap like this happened all the
time before you people got here

Sir there are children present

ANGRY CITIZEN
Not mine They disappeared

into his legs

ANGRY CITIZEN
Is that emotional enough for you

For all we know your loved ones may
have just decided to take a drive into
Sheboygan They could walk through
your door at any moment Lets not
jump to conclusions
74 01092001

A meek little PRIEST with round glasses stands trying to calm
the crowd

PRIEST
Please please if I may Id like to
make a plea for calm There is an
explandnation for this which may give us
greater understanding It seems clear
that weve all been deceived from the
beginning but no one should be held
responsible other than the Great
Deceiver himself Satan In biblical
times the course of action would have
been to anoint Lucifers minions with
holy water

He pauses There is some agreement

hin
75 01092001

HOWARD
(this is for Karen)
I just I cant tell you how sorry I
am If Id had any idea that my work
could have lead to consequences like
these I never wouldve begun I

AGITATOR
(from the back)
Cut to the chase egghead Wheres my
wife

HOWARD
It appears when we went into
emergency shutdown we created a phase
transition around the perimeter of the
collider ring People who crossed over
the border at that exact moment seem to

have-

AGITATOR
DISAPPEARED We know that part Where
are they

HOWARD

If we assume as string theorists have
that there are as many as fourteen
dimensions and as Kaluza suggests
that both gravity and electromagnetism
are associated with ripples in the
fabric of space the missing people may
have been delivered into a yet unseen
and curled up dimension

Theyre listening

HOWARD (cont’d)
Thats just a theory But its the one
I believe in You see I dont think
we live in just a universe I believe
we live in a multiverse where time and
place are as fluid as water where they
move back forwards up down and
through one another This machine is
the only way into those universes
and the only way out Its our only
chance to put things back the way they
were

The crowd is quiet His sincerity is impressive
76 01092001

HOWARD (cont’ d)
Please We cant just pull the plug

Karen finally speaks up

KAREN
Can‘you guarantee that nothing like
what just happened is ever going to
happen with that thing again

HOWARD
Guarantee

KAREN
Yes As in give us your word

HOWARD
(pause)
No I cant

The Undersecretary steps forward

UNDERSECRETARY
All right lets put it to a vote
Those in favor of giving Dr Heywood
another chance please raise your
hands

Not one person raises their hand

UNDERSECRETARY (contd)
Those in favor of permanently
terminating the experiment and pressing
criminal charges-

All hands go up

the place is only lit by the harsh spotlights powered by
generator backup

At the main console Howard slumps in the big chair brooding
Conrad comes in carrying an extra large cup of coffee He
makes his way across the cavernous space finds Howard in his
seat

CONRAD
Hey Howd you get in

HOWARD
Over the fence You
78 01092001

CONRAD
(shows his dirty shirt)
Under Not a climber

Conrad clears his throat looks sad Howard gets up gives
Conrad back his chair Conrad smiles and sits Howard sighs
and plops into the chair next to him

CONRAD (cont’d)
Dont get too down on yourself

HOWARD
Its a catastrophic screw-up At least
one person is dead

CONRAD
Its not like youre the first
theoretical physicist to ever claim
human lives

Howard just looks at him -- thats supposed to help

Conrad continues oblivious shuffling papers cleaning up his
desktop

CONRAD (contd)
This is no time to sit around and sulk
Theres work to do

BOWARD
Didnt you read the signage Were out
of business

CONRAD
Oh please You really think the
Sparkle Creeky-ites are gonna find
their way out of the multiverse without

us
BOWARD
They hate us
CONRAD
Can you blame ‘em
HOWARD
They want to kill us
CONRAD
So Dude were physicists We eat

Fig Newtons
(MORE)
79 01092001

CONRAD (cont’d)
We dont date until were forty We
get wired on Jolt Cola and try to prove
Kerchoffs Law We are hero material
Come on lets get to work my caffeine
is peaking
HOWARD
Howare we gonna work The
Undersecretary cut us off from the main
power grid

CONRAD
He cant cut off our brains can he

He scoops up a yellow note pad from the desktop starts to throw
it in the trash then stops noticing something on it

CONRAD (cont’d)
This yours

He shows it to Howard who glances at it and shakes his head

HOWARD
Nope

Conrad starts to throw it away then looks again

CONRAD
Its your handwriting

HOWARD
(looking more closely)
It is isnt it
We take a look Weve seen it before
00 Loop
Howard wrinkles up his face puzzled
BOWARD (cont’ d)
Infinity symbol Loop Infinite
loop I dont remember writing this

While he thinks he doodles on the pad drawing the infinity
symbol over and over again

CONRAD
Must have been during the test
80 01092001

HOWARD
Im sure I did but Im saying I have
no recollection whatsoever

CONRAD
Weird The opposite ef deja vu What
do you call that

Howard looks at the note pad now filled with a dozen infinity
symbols

HOWARD
Something to think about

INT SHERIFFS OFFICE DAY

The Undersecretary sits at Karens desk on the phone Hes
using a headset his hands folded neatly on the squeaky-clean
desktop in front of him

UNDERSECRETARY
(into phone)
This is no longer a variance This is
an overage

Karen appears in the doorway makes a face can I talk to you
The Undersecretary holds up a finger -- in a minute

UNDERSECRETARY (cont’d)
(into phone)
Youre not listening to me Youre not

listening to me Youre not are you
listening to me Youre not listening
to me

He points to a chatr She sits

UNDERSECRETARY (cont’d)
(into phone)
Im aware of that Im aware of that
Im aware of that Youre not
listening to me This is no longer a
variance this is an overage I think
he knows where I stand

A long pause Suddenly Karen turns and looks at him -- were
you talking to me

But he holds
he must have

81 01092001

KAREN
Sorry what

UNDERSECRETARY
(of his phone call)
I think he knows where I stand
KAREN
Oh Good Well good Listen the
reason I-

UNDERSECRETARY
What can I do for you

KAREN
Well thats what I was about to say I-

up a finger -- be quiet Hes on the phone again

hit some button while she wasnt looking

UNDERSECRETARY
(into headset)
Im aware of that Im aware of that
Im aware of that

Karen drops her head in her hands

Karen turns

She hesitates -- was that into the phone

UNDERSECRETARY (cont’ d)
Have you looked at the variances Have
you looked at the overages Because
this isnt a variance This is an
overage You were saying

hes talking to her again

KAREN
Oh Right A lot of people me
included want to know exactly what you
intend to do next Were going along
with this whole news blackout of yours
we dont want a bunch of TV crews here
any more than you do What we do want
is our people back

UNDERSECRETARY
I understand I understand I
understand

He gestures -- go on
82 01092001

KAREN
Ah Thanks So now that everybodys
had a chance to cool down a bit a lot
of us are wondering if maybe Dr
Heywood wasnt right I mean if we
dont let him continue with what he was
doing how else are we going to fix
this mess —

UNDERSECRETARY
Youre not listening to me

KAREN
Of course I am Im just try-

But of course thet was back into the headset Hes on the
phone again holding up a finger for her to wait

UNDERSECRETARY
Youre not listening to me This is no
longer a variance this-

RIP With one swift move Karen darts forward and yanks the
headset plug right out of the phone

KAREN
Thats a real good way to get your ass
kicked

UNDERSECRETARY

You cut off the directorate sub-head

KAREN
Please answer my question What do you
intend to do with Dr Heywood 3 and the
collider

UNDERSECRETARY
Well

He sits back about six inches You know to be friendly
Convivial

UNDERSECRETARY (cont’ d)
This project which is under my direct
supervision and at the top of my
accountability tree has gone wrong
Wildly spectacularly litigiously
haywire Just this morning it was
assigned a PILR number the size of my
cholesterol count

(he pronounces it pillar)
83 01092001

KAREN
PILR

UNDERSECRETARY
Personal Injury Liability Rating

He tosses a government report across the desk to her She
pushes it aside

KAREN
Cant you just tell me -- what is it
youre doing

UNDERSECRETARY
Ive already pulled the plug Now Im
going to bury the outlet Im bringing
in a DOE demolition crew and a
million cubic yards of cement Im
going to dynamite the lab and bury this
boondoggle once and for all Now
before the lawyers get here

KAREN
Youre covering your ass

UNDERSECRETARY
That will be a fortuitous side benefit
of my actions which are undertaken
solely in the interests of the public
good

KAREN
And if somebody thinks it should stay
open If somebody tries to stop you

UNDERSECRETARY
The pendulous weight of the federal
court system will fall on them like a
cartoon safe The law Sheriff is on
my side You are on my side

Karen just looks at him

EXT ROAD INTO TOWN DAY

Howard rides a bicycle as fast as he can down a lonely road
headed for town
B4 01092001

As he approaches the forkin the road which we saw in the
opening (the one with the big tree in the middle of it) he ZIPS
right past the squad car which Karen is driving in the opposite
direction toward the plant as fast as she can

HOWARD
HEY

INT SQUAD CAR DAY
Karen looks up sees him in her rear view

KAREN
HEY

EXT ROAD INTO TOWN DAY

Howard zips around on his bike Karen zips around in the car
Now they barrel toward each other pass each other once more
(they do not collide) before Howard finally ditches the bike and
goes running up to her

Karen leaps out of the car pulling off the eyeglasses she wears
when she drives They meet right at the fork in the road

HOWARD KAREN
I was on my way to see you I was on my way to see you

They double take at the simultaneous dialogue then try to start
again

HOWARD KAREN
I want you to let me- I think you should-

She gestures you go first

HOWARD
(deep breath)
We think we know what happened Not
why exactly but at least what I
want you to let me activate the
collider one more time And before you
say forget it I think you should know

that-
KAREN
Okay
HOWARD
(surprised)

What about the Undersecretary
y

85 01092001

KAREN
I dont think hell be bothering you

She gestures to the back of her car where the Undersecretary is
literally tied up -- handcuffed to the grill in the back seat
and none too happy about it

Howard looks back at her thrilled

EOWARD
Can I ask why

KAREN
Whats the matter with you cant take
yes for an answer

HOWARD
I just how could you how could
anyone ever trust me again After
everything Ive done your father
Jerry Corndell all those cows

She steps up to him puts her hands on his shoulders looks into
his eyes

KAREN

Dr Heywood Sometimes youve just got

to have a little faith in people
He looks at her overcome --
-- and kisses her Its a big kiss arms around her mouth
pressed hard and she returns it immediately xight there under
the big spreading elm where anybody in the universe could see
then
She pulls back first all conflicted

KAREN (contd)
Im engaged to Bob

HOWARD
Im in love with you

She looks at him moved --

-- and theyre at it again all arms and lips and limbs
intertwined

She pulls back again
She grabs him and kisses him again

86 01092001

KAREN
Stop kissing me
HOWARD
Stop kissing me back
KAREN
Thats beside the point
HOWARD
That is the point
KAREN
I cant have this happen right now

I had everything all figured out and
this time it was gonna work I was
gonna make it work

HOWARD
Theres this story called Flatland
In Flatland they only have two
dimensions No depth ‘Everybodys a
triangle a straight line or a circle
And one day this straight line hes
perfectly happy just living his flat
little life but all of a sudden he sees
this sphere it just descends into his
world And he he had no idea That
anything could be so beautiful Ive
never been in love before I thought I
was a couple times but the truth is I
didnt even notice when they left But
then you come along with your mint chip
ice cream cone and you ruin everything
nothing is the same anymore Im
freezing to death and the quiet is
killing me and Im just lost in all
this empty space I thought I loved but
I dont I love you Sheriff

KAREN
Youre a real pain in the ass

HOWARD
Ill get your father back I promise

KAREN
How

Between breathless kisses

EXT TEKCOM DAY

CLANG A sledgehammer smashes through the padlock hanging over
the front gate of TekCom Karen and Howard throw open the
gates and stand aside The Technicians and Scientists return to
work many on bikes many on foot some in hopelessly battered
cars all streaming up the hill toward the Big’Rick lab

Howards voice comes over the image

HOWARD (0S)
Weve activated the collider twice
Both times in the very instant beam on
beam collisions began a strange
phenomenon occurred

FLASHBACK IMAGE

Were back in Karens house just before the Packer game
started

HOWARD (0S)
It was fleeting it was barely
detectable --

MITCH

Karen you up

That strange ripple passes through the screen and the image
hiccups

MITCH (cont’ da)
Karen you up

ANOTHER FLASHBACK IMAGE

This time were in the Big Rick lab where we see the same
thing happen this time to Conrad

CONRAD
Stable data-taking mode
(ripple)
Stable data-taking mode

Int BIG RICK TUNNEL DAY

In the Big Rick tunnel an endless row of fluorescent lights
light up one after the other Howards voice continues over
Be 01092001

HOWARD (0S)
We skipped back in time three seconds
But within moments it was as if itd
never happened Literally

We follow the row racing down the tunnel and emerging in --
INT BIG RICK LAB DAY

-- the Big Rick lab where the lights are all flickering to life
as the crew gets back to work Howards voice continues

HOWARD (0S)
None of us even remember it

On the main control deck we find Howard Karen and Conrad who
is settling back into his chair

KAREN
Then how do you know it ever happened

HOWARD
Because we checked the Forward Time
Projection Chamber °

He rushes over to a large complex device next to the main
detector His excitement is growing

BROWARD (cont’ d)

(about to explain)
The Forward Time Projection Chamber --

(thinks better of it)
-- is real complicated But the basic
idea is that its a recording device
See everything that happens inside the
collision diamond happens so fast that
we need a special detector that
isolates individual collision events to
within a few billionths of a second so
we can compose individual computer re-
creations later When we checked the
Chamber memory we found this --

ACROSS THE ROOM

hundreds upon hundreds of collision pri-touts have been mounted
on the wall in paisings of two Theyre now in front of then

HOWARD
Doubles Thousands of ther Identical
collisions
89 01092001

CONRAD
Which are impossible
HOWARD
Which are impossible Like two people
having the same fingerprints Or twin
snowflakes But even less likely
CONRAD
By an order of magnitude
HOWARD
By an order of magnitude
KAREN

Then why did it happen

HOWARD
Because the collision threw us into an
infinite loop Plunged us into a
groove in time stuck us there
repeating the instant of impact over
and over maybe a thousand times before
another collision came along and threw
us out of it I knew it the moment it
happened --

Howard grabs the notepad the one on which he scrawled the note
during the experiment earlier and points to it with great
excitement

HOWARD (cont’ d)
I wrote it right here Infinite loop

KAREN
I think Id remember doing the same
thing a thousand times in a row

HOWARD
But you dont thats the point None
of us do I didnt remember writing
this note because the memory no longer
existed The impression was there
briefly it ghosted around in my
synapses for a few seconds just a
lingering electrical charge but then
it faded evaporated into the only
dimension that matters the here and
now
tN

90 01092001

KAREN
How does this help us fix what
happened

HOWARD
I dont want to fix anything I want
to take it so it was never broken in
the first place

KAREN
(sees where hes going with
this)
You want to go back in time

HOWARD
YOU KET YOUR ASS I DO

INT DETECTOR MECHANISM DAY

We crawl over the immensely complicated wiring and circuitry of
the detector mechanism as Conrads voice calls out amplified
throughout the lab

CONRAD (0S)
ROLL THE DETECTOR

BAM BAM The hydraulic pipes PISTON into their floor sockets
concrete GROANS and tiny cracks spiderweb through it as the
massive device begins its roll across the floor of the Big Rick
lab As we move with it Howards voice continues

HOWARD (0S)
We dont want to go back just a few
seconds that wont do us any good We
need days

UP ON THE CONTROL DECK

Conrads panel is lighting up like a Christmas tree as he runs
through his pre-activation checklist Howard continues to
Karen

EOWARD
Three days to be precise And for a
reaction that powerful well need to
generate more energy we figured it at
ten to the eighteenth power

KAREN
By energy do you mean speed
91 01092001

CONRAD
We mean energy

KAREN
I thought speed was energy

’ CONRAD
Speed is speed
KAREN
Then whats energy

CONRAD
Mass

KAREN
Then whats mass

CONRAD
Mass is energy too

KAREN
Mass is energy

CONRAD
Mass is energy

KAREN
Then why not call mass energy in the
first place and have that be the word
for energy and theres no energy but
just mass

CONRAD
(thinks)
Mass is energy

HOWARD
SO LIKE I WAS SAYING

DOWN ON THE MAIN FLOOR

were back aboard the enormous rolling detector which is
creeping toward the collision diamond inside the tunnel overlap
section Howards voice continues

HOWARD (0S)
We have to increase the energy with
multiple collisions each one building
on the last

92 01092001

y

Drawing closer we notice something interesting It looks like
a flywheel fitted right over the center of the exit point of
one of the tunnel tubes There are five distinct areas on it
each a different color

HOWARD (0S) (CONT’D)
Conrads constructed a five-point
flywheel --—

BACK UP ON THE MAIN DECK
Howard goes on to Karen
HOWARD
- with particles of five different

elements each with increasing specific
weights --

BACK INSIDE THE DETECTOR
the first wing of the flywheel is a silvery color

HOWARD (0S)
First is mercury

The flywheel spins rotates a grayish-looking wing over the end
of the tube

HOWARD (CONT’D)
Second is polonium

The flywheel spins three more times each element different-
looking and each corresponding to

HOWARD (0S) (CONT’D)
Then comes radon iridium --

BACK IN THE LAB

CONRAD
But Im opposed to iridium

BOWARD
We know youre opposed to iridium

KAREN
Why is he opposed to iridium

BROWARD
Long story

93 01092001

BACK IN THE MACHINE

the flywheel rotates over to the final element a sinister-
looking blueish substance

HOWARD (0S)
And finally the heaviest element’ known
to man -- ununoctiun

BACK UP ON THE MAIN DECK

Howard is finishing

HOWARD
As each new element collides the
energy will increase By our
calculations the fifth and final
element will give us exactly enough
unstable energy to hurl us back in time
by seventy-two hours Three days

BELOW THEM

BOOM The giant blue ring settles into place in the center of
the lab between two equally gigantic magnet rings The lab
trembles

WORKER
DETECTOR IS UP

ON THE DECK
Karen turns away from the detector looks back at Howard her

mind racing ahead through the consequences of the events hes
just outlined for her

KAREN
But Howard three days ago we wont
have met

HOWARD
I know

Conrad starts calling out the checks with more urgency this
time than before

CONRAD
Vacuum

VOICE (0S)
Check

KAREN

We might never meet well forget that
any of this ever happened

HOWARD
It wont have happened
CONRAD

Howard grabs Karen by the arms

HOWARD
Unless we remember Like when you
first wake up from a dream and you
have those few in-between moments where
you can force yourself to remember to
find that one little clue that tiny
piece of string that can tug you back
into the whole dream But if you wait
too long its gone forever We wont
have much time when we come out of
this We have to see each other pick
a place and meet

KAREN
The tree At the fork in the road
where we met this afternoon

Conrad enters commands wildly The AC power hum begins The
WATER RUSHES through the pipes

HOWARD
(still to Karen)
Maybe we can do it Maybe were not
all doomed to repeat our mistakes over
and over again maybe were not stuck
in an infinite loop Maybe our lives
do belong to us

KAREN
But thats just hope -

HOWARD
Oh That

Conrad flips open the metal box exposing the big ONOFF switch
He turns looks at Howard ‘Everyone looks at Howard

CONRAD
On your word Boss

Howard looks at Karen

HOWARD
You do this one

Karen swallows Puts her hand on the switch

96 01092001

CONRAD
And --

She SLAMS it up into place

CONRAD (cont’d)
- we are in collider mode

EXT COUNTRY ROAD DAY

Qver a rise in the road a long column of white cars and trucks
HUMS over a rise in the road As they WHOOSH past us we see
discrete block lettering on their sides

DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY
Theyre coming
EXT MAIN STREET DAY
A SPEAKER atop the squad car BLARES a message

OWEN (0S)
ATTENTION CITIZENS THE SUPERCOLLIDER

MINUTES

Owen behind the wheel is speaking into the microphone as he
slowly trolls the streets

OWEN (0S) (CONTD)
PERSONAL SAFETY IS YOUR OWN
RESPONSIBILITY LIFE ISNT FAIR
DONT SAY WE DIDNT WARN YOU

He passes the bench on Main Street where the Three Old Guys are
back in their familiar spots now sporting casts and slings and
other signs of damage

They pass a rope from one to another looping it through
themselves and the bench ‘Tying themselves in Wouldnt miss
this for the world either
EXT BACK YARD DAY

Those same kids are in that same swimming pool Their Mother
pokes her head out the door

This time they bolt out of the water and race toward the house
dripping wet

EXT MAIN STREET DAY

Remaining Townspeople run to get the hell off the streets

Doors SLAM Cars pull into garages In seconds the town looks
deserted

INT SHERIFFS OFFICE DAY

In the Sheriffs office the Undersecretary is behind bars on a
chair staring out of the cell like a lizard on a rock

Owen enters to find Bob Kugelmas rifling through desk drawers
Owen strikes a pose puts his hand on the butt of his gun

OWEN
Step away from the desk Sir

BOB
Where are the keys to the cell Owen

OWEN
(still officious)
The keys are on my pull chain Sir

BOB
Stop calling me sir and help me let
this guy out

OWEN

Ive got strict orders from Karen to
keep him here I answer to her

UNDERSECRETARY
No you answer to me I could list the
federal chain of command Do you want
me to list the chain of command

BOB
Dont make him do it Owen it takes a
really long time Karens lost it
shes gonna get us all killed if we
dont stop her
IN

98 01092001

OWEN
I will not disobey a direct order from
my superior Youve seen her when
shes mad

Bob reaches out and grabs the keys from Owen They stretch out
from his belt thing and Bob starts to walk toward the cell
pulling Owen along with hin

OWEN (cont’ d)
Let go of those keys Kugelmas
by BOB
Make me

Owen leaps onto Bobs back and locks his head in a WWF sleeper
hold They commence a-wrasslin

CUT TO

INT BIG RICK LAB DAY

Crazy off-center collisions produce wild patterns on the wall
monitors all around the Big Rick lab

At the controls Conrad stares intently at his screen

CONRAD
Glancing blow indirect not yet

Suddenly his screen explodes in a perfectly symmetrical
pattern as does every other screen in the lab

CONRAD (cont’d)
BEAM ON BEAM

KAREN
(to Howard)
Hey were not gonna have that no-
gzavity problem again are we

HOWARD
Dont be ridic-

WHOMP With stunning suddenness Conrads chair legs splinter
right out from under him and his chair collapses to the floor

As does Conrad As does everyone in the entire laboratory
theyre all slammed to the floor as if gravity were suddenly
ten times stronger than it was two seconds ago (which in fact
it is)
99 01092001

Shelves fall from walls everything drops and nothing bounces
soda cans crumple by themselves the basketball lands and sticks
like a wet muffin

EXT MAIN STREET DAY

On Main Street birds fall Trees bend Car tires POP and
deflate

EXT POND DAY
In a pond two rowboats sink up to their gunwales
ExT TOWN SQUARE DAY

The statue of the guy on the horse flattens the horses legs
going out from under it

INT SHERIFFS OFFICE DAY

Bob is still searching for the right key Owen is still on his
back trying to stop hin

WHAM Excess gravity tears the keys from Bobs hand and they
fall to the floor WHAM WHAM Bob goes down Owen goes
down WHAM The Undersecretary flattens his chair

Bob and Owen meet eyes The keys now lie equidistant between
them With all his effort Owen pulls himself up on his elbows
Then Bob does Its a race to defy excess gravity and fight
their way to the keys -- a very slow race

EXT MAIN STREET DAY

The Three Old Guys lie on their backs on their splintered bench
staring up at the sky as birds rain down around them

OLD MAN 1
My back
OLD MAN 2—
My leg
OLD MAN 3
My bladder
INT BIG RICK LAB DAY

Plastered to the floor as they are its hard to talk their
mouths seem to be part of the concrete But Karen Howard and
Conrad struggle anyway their speech heavily slurred
100 01092001

EOWARD
Plenty of gravity now

Conrad starts dragging himself across the floor he looks like a
whale trying to cross a beach

CONRAD
Gotta change beam path
Ceiling tiles start to pull free they crash around him like
mortars Now the fluorescent lights begin to drop off their
chains tubes SHATTER on the ground as Conrad gets one hand up
on his desktop

On the desktop the hand trembles up into the air a few inches
then SLAMS down on the keyboard

ON THE SCREENS

the collision patterns lose their symmetry go back to the crazy
patterns that were there before

INT SHERIFFS OFFICE DAY
Suddenly freed from the floor both Owen and Bob lunge for the
keys at the same time Bob gets them first and leaps up starts
unlocking the cell door
OWEN
Thats a felony Bob

BOB
And youre in high school stay outta

’ my way
He swings the cell door open wide
INT BIG RICK LAB DAY
In the lab everyone starts dragging themselves to their feet

EXT MAIN STREET DAY

The Three Old Men stand up A few other Townspeople poke their
heads out of doors

OLD MAN 1
All things considered it could have
been worse

OLD MAN 2
Give em a minute

They hear a RUMBLING in the distance and turn The Department
of Energy convoy is on them POUNDING through the streets at top
speed

They slow as they reach the center of town The Undersecretary
hurries up alongside leaps onto the step rail of the lead

truck Bob Kugelmas jumps on too and they ROAR up the hill
headed for the plant

INT BIG RICK LAB DAY
The mechanical voice BOOMS in the lab
VOICE (0S)
Polonium rotation in three two
one
INSIDE THE MACHINE
the flywheel turns HUMMING softly turning away from the
glistening silvery mercury window Another window rotates into
place this one shiny black It CLICKS into place and a
brilliant red beam shoots right through it
IN THE LAB
Conrad spins in his chair
CONRAD
Polonium electrons are stripped and

collisions occurring

Once again the monitors explode with fireworks
102 01092001

CONRAD (cont’d)
now

Everybody freezes Takes a breath For a long moment nothing
Nobody moves not a muscle Finally Karen speaks but she does
it in a strange way her mouth barely moving

KAREN
Is it me or do you feel weird

EOWARD
Weirder than before

KAREN
Oh yes

She moves her arm Something isnt quite right about the way it
moves its robot-like rising straight up like a paper dolls
arms

The entire screen image pivots like a painting hanging on a
center wire As the image flattens out we see what the problem
is

Theyre in a two-dimensional world

The image keeps rotating now becoming almost paper-thin giving
us a sideways view of their world which is all there is It

keeps turning all the way around doing a one-eighty and when
the image fills the screen again were seeing them from behind

Everything in the lab is flattened out including the people
Theres no depth anymore everything looks like photographs cut
out and pasted on the same background

KAREN (cont’ d)
You said there were fourteen
dimensions

HOWARD
I said there might be

KAREN
WELL YOU JUST LOST TWELVE

EXT TEKCOM DAY

Outside the whole town has lost its depth it looks like a
photocollage with no perspective
103 01092001

The DOE convoy moves up the hill of the flattened landscape
an absurd image of cutout trucks and cars that makes us squeal
with delight like little children

INT BIG RICK LAB DAY

Howard rotates toward Conrad showing us his flat side

HOWARD
Conrad Manually rotate the flywheel
CONRAD
You got it Slim

Conrad turns and slithers across the walls like a shadow
heading for his control seat which he then wipes into

CONRAD (contd)
Radon molecules on deck

INSIDE THE MACHINE

the 2D flywheel rotates to another brightly-colored section
The beam shines through turning the entire screen red for a
moment

EXT HIGH ABOVE SPARKLE CREEK DAY

From high above Sparkle Creek we hear the WHINING of the
supercollider reach its peak level

And the entire town disappears

The town really disappears everything within the circles
perimeter is gone leaving only a flat shimmering silvery
mirrored plane All around it the idyllic grasslands are still
there the trees and birds and streams and stuff

At the edge of the shiny plane birds CHIRP The creek BABBLES
A badger peeks his head out of his hole Several DEER prarce
forward grazing One of them noses up to the edge of the
shimmery silver plane and gives it a sniff

But suddenly the deer turns its head and freezes cocking an ear
to the wind Danger is in the air and it aint no hunters

A low RUMBLING sound rises up grows rapidly louder

The deer take off
104 01092001

The image shudders undulates and with an enormous WHOMP the
entire town of Sparkle Creek re-emerges inflating in a split-
second like a balloon at the end of a fire hose

INT BIG RICK LAB DAY

Well everybodys back and theyre all 3D And theyre not
feeling too chatty Karen flexes her fingers pats her hair

Howard clears his throat embarrassed The moment of silence is
punctuated by that mechanical voice

This is gonna be iridium I am deeply
deeply deeply opposed to using
iridium

HOWARD
What Because of the Walker Treatise

CONRAD
Of course because of the Walker
Treatise

KAREN
Whats the Walker Treatise

BOWARD
Its bad science Irresponsible
alarmist doomsday claptrap

CONRAD

(fast like the whole rest of

the movie)
Walker et al conjectured that iridium
collisions could create a roving black
hole which would swallow up not only
our solar system and the Milky Way but
the entire Virgo Supercluster and all
matter in the observable universe
105 01092001

HOWARD
Uh NOT
CONRAD
Of course after a second big bang all
cosmic history could evolve in
pretisely the same manner and we might
end up right back here in this room
but who wants to wait thirteen billion
years
HOWARD
(to Karen)
Dont listen to him Im right about
this
KAREN
God knows you were right about
everything else
HOWARD
Come on even Walker said it was just a
one in seven hundred million chance I
really dont think Im wrong
KAREN
So some purple headed alien whos just
minding his own business is gonna get
obliterated because you cant put your
ego aside
HOWARD
(hurt)
Do you think I have a big ego

INT TEKCOM LOBBY DAY

Led by the Undersecretary the DOE CRISIS TEAM which

includes many uniformed FEDERAL MARSHALS bursts through the
doors of the TekCom lobby and takes off toward the elevators

Int BIG RICK LAB DAY

The argument in the lab is reaching a fevered pitch

INSIDE THE MACHINE

the flywheel rotates Iridium slides up into place Its a
very creepy amber color

The beam shoots through it
IN THE LAB

the screens erupt in a beautiful display Collisions like weve
never seen

Prom across the room a TINY BLACK SWIRLING PINPOINT appears
right in the center of the event triangle where the collision
itself is taking place

It begins to move or rove if you will growing larger as it
does Within a second or two the black spot is the size of a
cue ball

But this little guys got a lotta juice Every single thing in
the laboratory including the air bends toward it stretches
elongates and then with one great slurp all matter in the lab
is sucked into the black spot and swallowed

The entire screen goes black but only for a second as we cut
to --

EXT VIRGO SUPERCLUSTER SPACE NIGHT

Seen from a distance that little black spot fella now pulsing
with a swirling halo of light around it appears in an outer
spiral arm of the Milky Way

Mirroring the process that happened in the lab all light from
all stars in the Virgo Supercluster begins to bend toward it and
is sucked away in an instant leaving a black screen

No sound No light

No movie except for a barely detectable pulsing black spot in
the middle of the screen

113 01092001 KA-BOaM

All that dark and all that quiet is replaced by the biggest
brightest loudest explosion youve ever seen all emanating
from that black little cue ball guy who was pulsing at the
center of the screen the whole time

Out of the swirling gases and birthing stars left in the
explosions wake a legend appears

THIRTEEN BILLION YEARS LATER

In three seconds we see the Milky Way re-form itself we hyper-
zoom toward it right toward that outer spiral arm where --

INT BIG RICK LAB DAY

- Conrads face pleads with us back in the Big Rick lab which
is identical in every way to what we saw before Hes talking
fast the exact same words (and same shot) as we just saw

CONRAD
Walker et al conjectured that iridium
collisions could create a roving black
hole which would swallow up not only
our solar system and the Milky Way but
the entire Virgo Supercluster and all
matter in the observable universe

Howard looks at him skeptical

HOWARD
You know

But this time he really considers it

HOWARD (cont’d)
I could be wrong about this

CONRAD
So bail on the iridium

HOWARD
Yeah better safe than sorry
KAREN
Hey it takes a highly evolved man to

admit when hes wrong

Howard shrugs modestly The mechanical voice speaks up

UNDERSECRETARY
STEP AWAY FROM THOSE CONTROLS

Howard and Karen turn toward them Conrad shoots one quick
glance and knows the score He looks from them to the big
onoff switch in the metal panel

He dives onto his keyboard and starts typing as fast as his
fingers will allow

VOICE (0S)
Ununoctium rotation in fifteen seconds

Howard is grabbed by two Agents and shoved roughly up against

outstretched finger

The voice stops It never says two

CLICK Handcuffs bite into Howards wrists

CRUNCH Karen is shoved onto the floor a foot in her back
SMACK Howards face hits the floor next to hers

Around them the WHOOSE of the water through the pipes ceases
The electric power hum stops The sound of the machine quiets

In the silence of the lab the Undersecretary stands over Howard
and Karen staring down at them officiously
iN

116 01092001

UNDERSECRETARY
Now Im gonna put this thing out of
my misery once and for all

He turns to Conrad whos being held by Agents

UNDERSECRETARY
What do you think I am some local
official A dog catcher a vote

He sweeps an arm out pointing it at the big onoff switch
still clearly in the ON position

UNDERSECRETARY (cont’d)

CONRAD
It is off

He looks at Howard meaningfully

Howards eyes widen He looks at Karen

HOWARD
It is off
KAREN

Fine Ill do it myself

He marches across the lab up the steps to the console and over
to the switch

CONRAD
(under his breath)
You do that

On the platform the Undersecretary puts his hand on the switch
and SLAMS it into the off position He turns to face the

others

INSIDE THE MACHINE

the red beam EXPLODES through the translucent blue creating a
gorgeous diamond-flecked PURPLISH BLAST

BACK IN THE LAB

we see the entire lab from across the room as that familiar
ripple waves through it but this is one is strange bigger
more powerful and distinct than the others The ripple
shudders the image bends and the ripple fades away over a shot

HOWARDS HEAD suddenly leaps up into frame Hes wearing the
clothes we was wearing in the beginning of the movie He looks
around wild-eyed

He reaches in front of Conrad and snatches up the distinctive
note pad on which he doodled the infinity symbols earlier

But now the top page is blank

HOWARD

Conrad sitting in his chair is caln
120 01092001

CONRAD
Well lets not get ahead of ourselves

EXT MAIN STREET DAY

Howard pumps hard riding the bike as fast as he can He rides
down the middle of Main Street which is restored to what it
once was

He sees the statue of the General on the horse now unbroken
He sees the Three Old Guys also unbroken He waves like a
crazy man they nod and smile

Howard turns back and almost hits a guy crossing the street with
a big foamy latte He swerves at the last second

Guy
Wheres the fire Chief

HOWARD
Sorry
He looks back over his shoulder recognizes the guy -- its
Jerry Corndell alive and well Howard SHRIEKS with glee happy
to see Jerry alive points at him

HOWARD (cont’ d)
HAH ZUZUS PETALS

He turns back to the road bears down and pedals even faster

JERRY CORNDELL
Knew hed snap one of these days

EXT COUNTRY ROAD DAY

A FARMER pilots a big old John Deere tractor slowly down a
country road Karens squad car swerves by and passes him at
about ninety miles per

INT SQUAD CAR DAY

Karen drives like a maniac rocking back and forth pounding the
wheel urging every bit of power out of her car that she can
possibly get Determined Certain

Weve seen this before -- it was the opening of the movie

We look closely at Karens face A slight almost imperceptible

ripple slithers through the image so faint it could have been a
printing mistake That ripple

yp

123 01092001

Suddenly Karen stops rocking sits up straight a confused look
crossing her brow She looks around tries to get her bearings

KAREN
Where am I going

EXT COUNTRY ROAD ‘DAY

Howard is pumping hard up a hill He cant see the horizon
beyond it

HOWARD
Dont forget dont forget dont
forget

But his legs are tired hes running out of steam desire
something We rise up and peek

OVER THE CREST OF THE BILL

where we see Karens cruiser approaching a fork in the road the
huge spreading oak tree planted dead in the middle of it

Karens cruiser slows to a crawl headed straight for the tree
and stops just short of it

INT CAR DAY

Karen just sits there at the wheel puzzled as can be not sure
which way to go Then suddenly for no apparent reason --

- she bursts into tears Worse than tears horrible wracking
sobs of pain and loss

KAREN
(between sobs)
What is going on

Choking back the emotion she reaches for the radio keys the
microphone

KAREN (cont’d)
Uh hey Owen

EXT COUNTRY ROAD DAY

Howard pumps hard comes over the rise sees the squad car in
the distance as it starts up backs away

HOWARD
WAIT
124 01092001

He pedals even harder The squad car turns toward the other
fork in the road

HOWARD (cont’d)
DONT GO

Karen hits the gas the squad car ROARS off and Howard lunges
his bike across the grass He hits a rock it sends him flying
into the air he sails over the hood of the car --

-- and SLAMS into her windshield Through the glass we see
Karens eyes widen in shock

She leaps out of the car and runs around to help Howard who is
peeling himself off her windshield

KAREN
Are you all right

Howard rolls over toward her now lying on his back on the hood
of the car his head against the windshield rubbing the back of

his head

KAREN (cont’d)
What did you do that for

Be turns looks at her blinking disoriented He sits up
Takes a look around to get his bearings Looks back at her

HOWARD
I was meeting someone I think

RAREN
Who

Suddenly a wave of emotion passes over his face he sits up
fighting back tears Embarrassed he turns slightly away hides
his face in his hands

KAREN (cont’d)
Whats the matter sir

HOWARD
I wish I knew

His shoulders heave he takes a deep breath turns toward her
HOWARD (contd)

Im having the strongest feeling of
deja vu
125 01092001

YY

KAREN
(surprised realizing it)
So am I

He climbs off the hood of the car

HOWARD
Strange when that happens isnt it

KAREN
Ill say

EOWARD
It always makes me think theres
something I should remember

KAREN
Too bad there never really is

BOWARD
(trying like crazy to remember)
Like waking up from a dream if you
can just get a hold of one thread of
t it

KAREN
Are you sure youre all right

HOWARD
I guess so

She reaches in her shirt pocket takes out the eyeglasses she
wears to drive and puts them on

KAREN
You take care now sir

She starts to turn away

But Howards eyes light up and suddenly he grabs her by the
shoulders and turns her to face him

KAREN (cont’ d)
Hey

He pulls her in close staring at her face We go in close too

to see what hes staring at Its her eyeglasses

( KAREN (contd)
What are you doing
126 01092001

He doesnt answer just snatches them off her face and holds
them up even closer studying the outline of the black frames
That outline leaps out at us its a perfect sideways figure
eight weve seen this shape before

ITS THE INFINITY SYMBOL
Karen unsnaps the holster flap of her gun

KAREN (contd)
Im gonna need you to keep your
distance sir

But he doesnt Instead he grabs her and kisses her

She pulls away

She says nothing for a moment just staring at him squinting
hard trying knowing theres something she has to remember

KAREN (cont’ d)
Do that again

He kisses her again What akiss This time they pull apart
slowly just a few inches breathing each others breath

Her face breaks out in a smile like a sunrise She remembers

KAREN (cont’ d)
(whispers)
Just one more time

And as they fall into the kiss to end all kisses we rise up
above them above the tree that marks the intersection the
point at which the two roads come together Karens voice comes
over once again like it did at the beginning

KAREN (V0) (CONT’D)
To Einsteins supposition that mankind
might one day know all that there is to
know about the universe I say this
Oh Albert

We climb higher and higher above them to see the sleepy town in
the distance and the whole wide world beyond

KAREN (V0) (CONTD)
Wheres the fun in that

FADE OUT
