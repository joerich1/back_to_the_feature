FADE IN

1 EXTCALIFORNIA BEACH — DAY 1

Seagulls squawk and the waves pound but we’re not talking

about Malibu Colony

here This is a fairly rundown beach

area catering to lower-echelon surfers vagrants and
strung out druggies of all ages several of whom stand or
sit on their haunches by a dilapidated old hamburger stand
Over the stand is a faded sign FAT SAM’S HAMBURGERS

A simple but haunting electronic melody plays in the bg

2 INT FAT SAM’S — DAY 2
Seated just inside the stand on a folding aluminum chair is
a chubby man in his late thirties He’s wearing a stained
valor sweat suit and a cap This is Fat Sam He’s a dealer
Seated on the sand next to him is Fletch a rangy man
early thirties in jeans and a Magic Johnson T-shirt
nodding idly on a battered Casio music machine which he
treats lovingly This is the source of the title music
FLETCH

So what do you figure

FAT SAM

thereon which is covered by a sheet except for the mid-

section

and plops it into Fletchs hand Fletch stands there holding
something icky out of frame looking uncomfortably up at the
ceiling the floor anywhere but at the cadaver or at the stuff
in his hand Meanwhile we hear sounds of further incisions and

faint

77 PRICATICE COURT - DAY

Gail Stanwyk is on the other side of the net loading tennis
balls into the automatic serve machine She is in her late

effervescent Fletch steps up to the entrance of the court

approaches Fletch

WAITER

WAITER

The Waiter leaves and Fletch watches as Mrs Stanwyk tries to
return the serving machines serves She swings so goofily that
she cant even get the racket on the ball She has clearly never
taken a lesson in her life and it is doubtful if she will ever
make contact with a tennis ball in this century

MRS STANWYK
Damn I thought I had that one

LETCH

LETCH

He demonstrates a swing She puts on a determined face makes an
awkward step and swings at the next ball missing it completely
and letting the racket fly

FLETCH
There much better

Mrs Stanwyk laughs happily and dodges the machine-served balls
to walk over to Fletch When shes almost up to him she turns
back to the serving machine and points a finger at it as if
addressing a pet dog

MRS STANWYK

I must be having an off day Im really a fabulous player

FLETCH

door Of course it is locked He takes out a credit card
starts to jimmy the lock and actually seems to be making
progress when his credit card snaps in half
FLETCH

Sht

He pockets the broken credit card steps back and looks over the
house for another possible point of entry

120 FLETCHS POINT OF VIEW - AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW

Double-hung Slightly warped so that the upper half does not
exactly true with the lower half

121 FLETCH

looks around to see how to climb up to it

122 MASTER

Theres only one way Climb up the side of the chain link fence
which separates him from the murderous dog Fletch approaches it
warily The dog is practically foaming Fletch reaches out a
hand to get a hold of the fence and the dog just about rips the
fence apart

FLETCH

(in his best Barbara Woodhouse)

Sit-tuh

This has no effect so Fletch backs up a few yards take a deep
breath for courage and makes a headlong running start for the
fence using his momentum to get to the top before the dog eats
him He grabs hold and scrambles wildly for the top He makes
it

FLETCH

Roll over Play dead Good boy

Fletch now grabs hold of the eave on the side of the house and
very carefully pulls himself onto it Its only about ten feet
from there to the vulnerable window but the angle of the eave
is rather steep and the going is treacherous As he makes his
way he keeps a wary eye on the dog who keeps leaping up
seemingly getting closer and closer to taking a giant bite out
of Fletchs backside

FLETCH

You any relation to Doctor Dolan
Now hes at the window He tries to open it but despite its
warped appearance from the ground it is locked Fletch looks at
the lock and cant believe it He sighs He shakes his head He
smashes the window with his elbow

run furiously around the fenced in yard that surrounds the
house

Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago
and never divorced making Stanwyk a bigamist
even in Utah Stanwyk is also traveling with

three million dollars in cash the result of
Gail Stanwyks conversion of Boyd Aviation stock
Mrs Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to
purchase property in Utah but it wasnt a fact
that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout
of Provo

Alan mulls over all this for a few seconds then smiles
wistfully

MR STANWYK
Bravo Mr Fletcher

FLETCH

The thing that really tipped it off for me
was something your wife said to me while we
were in bed together

Stanwyk shoots a surprised look at Gail She returns it with
innocent shrug

MR STANWY

MRS STANWYK

Mr Stanwyk reaches into his desk and pulls out his gun and
levels it at Fletch

MR STANWY

I was already prepared to commit one murder

FLETCH

Whoops

MRS STANWYK

her bravado deflated)

Whoops What do you mean ‘whoops
Dont say whoops

MR STANWYK

I mean by the time your story gets published Ill

enters

CUMMINGS
Greetings everyone

FLETCH
dryly)
hank God the police

FLETCH
Dont ever call me Irwin okay

MRS STANWYK

(to Cummings)

Ive got it all under control
Jerry You can go now

CUMMINGS

(laughs)

Under control You idiot You
didnt know who he was

During the following dialogues Fletch starts nudging the
fireplaces gas lighter jet key with his foot

CUMMINGS

Fat Sam left the beach today So did Gummy

It began to occur to me that some things are
beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of

MR STANWYK
I said Ill take care of it Now a man of your position
shouldnt be a part of whats about to go down So go
home and Ill call you tomorrow

CUMMINGS

What ‘long distance I couldnt help but hear
you say something about Rio Alan Youre not
leaving with the eight hundred thousand dollars
I staked you for the next load are you

FLETCH
Whoa Well you two obviously have a lot to talk
over so well go catch the last ten minutes of Dynasty

Fletch and Gail actually start to leave but Cummings draws his

gun and fires over their heads They dive for the floor landing
on the side of the fireplace Fletch palms a Zippo lighter from

his pocket

MR STANWYK

Jerry youre simply going to have to trust me
Ive got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy
and now youre jeopardizing everything

CUMMINGS
Your foolproof way is going to land my a on
the front page while youre basking in Rio

FLETCH
with your money

Cummings turns his head momentarily to consider what Fletch has
said and Stanwyk takes advantage of the distraction to go for
his gun But he is too slow Cummings shoots once striking
Stanwyk in the chest killing him instantly

Gail screams in horror Cummings turns to Fletch

CUMMINGS
This ones going to be even more fun

FLETCH
(striking the Zippo)
Go ahead Make my evening

Fletch hurls the lighter into the fireplace causing a great
whoosh of flames Cummings throws his hands up in front of his
face and Fletch leaps at him wrestling him to the ground
Cummings is the stronger of the two and just as he starts to

gain dominance over Fletch Gail Stanwyk staggers to her feet
picks up her husbands tennis racket in its wooden brace and
slams it against Cummings head with all her might

The Chief is knocked out
Fletch lies there panting trying to catch his breath He looks

up at Gail still holding the racket and staring at Alans
body Fletch hustles her out of the room

260-A HALLWAY

FLETCH
Im calling the police Then Im
leaving You wait here for them

GAIL

FLETCH

your life back together You dont need me around

chair sipping an exotic drink watching the cavorting lovelies
and playing his battered Casio This is obviously at some very

expensive beach club or hotel as witnessed by the uniformed
servant who brings a telephone

seen each other for awhile and her arrival is a surprise to
Fletch

GAIL

FLETCH
(big smile)
What are you doing here

They start walking down the beach We stay right with them
GAIL

I couldnt sit home and play the mournful
widow anymore and the police didnt need me
so I tried watching a Lakers game on TV

but the announcer talked to fast and I
couldnt understand a lot of what was
happening so I figured if I came

down here maybe you could explain the

rules to me and besides I missed you

FLETCH
No problem

He puts his arm around her as we watch them leave us behind and
walk off down the beach

FLETCH

Basketball of course was invented in France
and is played with a large ball two tongue
depressors anda fish

Fletch ad-libs just like Chevy Chase would as they walk further
away down the beach until we

FADE OUT
