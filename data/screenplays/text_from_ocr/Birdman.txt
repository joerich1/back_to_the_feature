BLACK 1
We hear a clock ticking

FADE IN

INT RIGGANS DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - DAY 1

Close on the brilliant colors of a middle eastern rug the
center of what seems to be a makeshift “meditation” space

We slowly tilt up to discover the back of Riggan Thomson He is in the proper ‘Lotus’ position dressed only in tight
white briefs and he appears to be meditating deeply And if all
this seems a little odd it becomes all the more so when you
notice that he is levitating almost two feet above the floor
His breath is calm and measured in and out in and out

MAN (V0)

How did we end up here
(Beat )

This place is a fucking dump

We begin to slowly move toward Riggans back while his measure
breathing continues We see a clock on the wall ticking

MAN (V0)
Smells like balls

A slight twitch in Riggans neck

MAN (V0)
We dont belong in this shithole

A Skype call shatters the silence Close on his back we follow
Riggan as he walks over to the computer and answers the call

On the computer screen appears Sam in a pair of Levis
and a Led Zeppelin T-shirt She has simple and striking good
looks with an edge in her voice and behind her eyes She
stands in a Korean Deli among the flowers talking to Riggan
through her iPhone

1A

The Korean Store owner stands in the background screaming
at her the whole time

RIGGAN
Sam I cant--

102914 2

SAM
Dad What kind of--

(Turning to Korean)
SHUT UP

(Back to screen)
What kind of flowers did you say you
wanted

RIGGAN
Alchemillas Or something soothing that
smells nice Listen I can‘t--

SAM
It all smells like fucking Kimchi

RIGGAN
Then whatever looks nice Anything but
roses No roses

KOREAN
Flowers dont need you touch They need you
buy

SAM

(Close into the screen)
I hate this job

And the Skype call is over Riggan closes the laptop and leans
forward trying to regain his calm His reflection appears in
the mirror and for the first time we see his face He has a
dark goatee and his hair looks strangely abundant There is a
piece of paper on the mirror with the handwritten phrase “A
thing is a thing not what it is said of that thing”

ANNIE ON SPEAKERS
Riggan theyre starting scene
five We need you on stage

RIGGAN
Shit

Riggan throws on a sweater and stumbles into his slacks He
hurries out
INT HALLWAYS - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 2
through the narrow corridors of the theater There is a lot
of activity as various workers and stage hands appear and
disappear carrying equipment and scenery As Riggan descends the
stairs a Stage Hand- passes by in the opposite direction

STAGE HAND

Mr Thomson

102914 3

RIGGAN
Steve

STAGE HAND
It’s Daniel

RIGGAN
(Already passed)
Okay

Riggan continues on until he arrives backstage He runs into
Jake his producer and friend

JAKE
Hows it going buddy

RIGGAN
Great Itd be even better if I
could get Ralph to stop acting like
he’s in an educational video for
syphilis

The camera moves off of them and onto

INT STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 3

the stage Suddenly we are in the midst of an Americana style
kitchen

Around the kitchen table sit Lesley plain and no nonsense
her simple hairstyle and makeup cant hide how attractive she
is Laura dark exotic the kind of woman who makes every
person she meets feel like shes seducing them And Ralph slightly handsome slightly balding slightly invisible

A half empty bottle of gin on the table they drink from
highball glasses as they chat

LESLEY
He loved me

RALPH
Yeah He loved her so much he tried
to kill her

LAURA

He tried to kill you

LESLEY
No (A beat) Okay well he did
beat me up one night He dragged me
around the living room by my
ankles yelling “I love you I love
(MORE)

102914 4
LESLEY (CONTD)
you bitch What do you do with a
love like that

RALPH
How is that-- That is not love and you know
it Why do you insist on calling it--

LESLEY
You can say what you want but I know what
it was

RALPH

What about you Nick Does that sound like
love to you

Riggan arrives at the table and sits

RIGGAN
Sorry Im late

(Beat In character)
Im the wrong person to ask I didnt
know the man Ive only heard his name
mentioned in passing Youd have to
know the particulars But I think what
youre saying is that love is absolute

RALPH
Yeah The kind of love Im talking about
is The kind of love Im talking about
you dont try and kill people
LESLEY
(Sadly )

It was love Mel To Eddie it was I dont
care what anybody says He was ready to die
for it

RALPH
Ask her what he did after she left him

LESLEY
He shot himself in the mouth But he
screwed that up too Poor Ed

RALPH
Poor Ed my ass The guy was dangerous
LAURA
Howd he screw it up if he shot himself in
the mouth
RALPH

(By the numbers)
He used to carry this twenty-two We lived
like fugitives those days I never knew--

102914 5

RIGGAN
(Breaking character to direct
Exasperated )

Okay Fugitives are on the run Ralph How

many times do I have to-- Fugitives are

scared Give me more of that

Ralph nods He takes a breath and dives in once again

RALPH
(The same but louder)
We lived like fugitives those days

Extremely frustrated Riggan stares out into the auditorium
From his POV we see Jake who is now sitting in the third row
His head buried in his hands tortured by Ralph’s performance
Riggan turns back to Ralph

RALPH (CONTD)
I never knew if he was going to come out
of the bushes or from behind a car and just
start shooting

Riggan watches Ralph act and sees his whole production headed
down the drain Ralph is just that bad

RALPH (CONTD)
The man was crazy He was capable of
anything

The actors all wait for a cue from Riggan who is now staring
up into the lights above the stage Laura finally picks up
Riggan’s cue

LAURA
Christ What a nightmare

RALPH
He used to call me at the hospital and

say
(Over the top)
Son of a bitch Your days are numbered

Silence Ralph looks over to Riggan

RALPH (CONTD)
Too much Little bit I just wanted to give
you a range so you could--

And with that a light comes barreling down from its perch and
crashes into Ralphs head making him hit the floor like a rag
doll Silence

LAURA
Holy shit

102914 6

Lesley and Annie the Stage Manager run over to Ralph
who is out cold Not knowing what to do they stare at him

LESLEY
Is he breathing

Jake runs toward the stage

JAKE
Someone call 911

Riggan slowly backs away from the chaos

LAURA
Is that blood coming out of his
ear

JAKE
(To Riggan )
Where are you going

LESLEY
Okay he’s breathing What did he
have for lunch

LAURA
Did anyone call for help

ANNIE

(Clapping )
Wake up Wake up

Two crew members try to help Ralph

CREW MEMBER
Grab his legs I got the top

JAKE
Dont move him Wait for the ambulance
(Calling out)
For the love of God I could get a black
audience in this theater faster than a
doctor

Riggan heads off the stage and Jake chases after him We
follow them as

INT HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 4
sthey walk through the corridor
JAKE

Where are you going Well have the
understudy ready to rehearse in five--

102914

RIGGAN
Forget the understudy We have to postpone
the preview

JAKE
What are you-- It’s a full house We would
have to refund all the--

RIGGAN
Then do it

A crew member passes in the opposite direction

CREW MEMBER-
Hows Ralph

RIGGAN
He’ll be fine

JAKE
Wait Wait Fuck Wait

RIGGAN

Listen to me It was going to be a
disaster That guy’s the worst actor Ive
ever seen The blood coming out of his ear
was the most honest thing hes done so far

JAKE
Hes not that bad

Riggan stops in his tracks and stares at Jake

JAKE (CONTD)
Okay hes fucking horrible But--

Riggan starts walking again
JAKE (CONTD)
You have the press in your dressing

room in a few hours How are we--

RIGGAN
Ill make something up

Two Technicians hurry up in the opposite direction
RIGGAN (CONTD)
Jake This happened for a reason It wasnt

Riggan enters

INT RIGGANS DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 5

shis dressing room and tries to shut the door Jake still in
the corridor stops it with his foot

JAKE
(Sticking his head in)
Ralphll sue us Hell sue us And hes got
a case

102914 9

Riggan releases the door

RIGGAN
Then make him go away

JAKE
How do you suggest I do that

RIGGAN
Youre my lawyer my producer and
my oldest friend We are going to
make this work Now just get out
there and do what you were born to
do

JAKE
Whats that

RIGGAN
I have no idea But I have faith
Now go away from me

JAKE
Do you think we should--

Riggan slams the door shut on Jake A beat On a television a
segment of E News A busty blond with an exaggerated smile
hosts

BLOND WOMAN
and when we come back an exclusive
interview with Robert Downey Jr who tells
us about the billion-dollar Iron Man
franchise The talented actor invited us
onto the set of Iron Man 3

Riggan slams the tv off his mind racing He sits on a chair

MAN (V0)
That clown doesn’t have half your talent
and he’s making a fortune in that Tin Man
get up

Riggan stares into the mirror in the reflection he catches
sight of a poster from a movie called Birdman 3 The
superhero Birdman (a younger Riggan in a bird costume) wings
widely spread stares directly back at him A hand written
note on the top of the poster reads Thomson break a wing
From the boys at Local 1 Riggan tries to calm himself with a
mantra

RIGGAN

Breathing in I embrace my anger
Breathing out I smile to it

102914 10

BIRDMAN (V0)
Embrace it Kiss it Turn it around and
fuck it in the--
A knock on the door behind him

RIGGAN
Not now

Laura opens the door and sticks her head in

LAURA
Can I come in

RIGGAN
No

LAURA
Okay Two words Shia La Beouf

RIGGAN
Thats three words

LAURA
Its two

RIGGAN
Get out

LAURA

I love you

She closes the door Riggan tries to calm himself down but
Laura opens the door again

LAURA (CONTD)
I take it we’re not going to dinner

anymore
RIGGAN

I dont have an actor
LAURA

I dont have a life
RIGGAN

Laura
LAURA

Fine Whatever
(Goes to leave but stops)

You remember at Joans when you

asked me to come do a Broadway play

with you You said it would be

fun

AS

102914 11

RIGGAN
Go away

LAURA
So far No fun

Riggan closes the door and looks at the Birdman poster

BIRDMAN (V0)
Fun You know what would be fun Getting
the fuck out of here before we humiliate
ourselves That would be fun

Riggan looks at himself in the mirror and begins to pull at
his hair As it comes off his head we discover it was a wig
He turns away from the mirror trying desperately to stay
calm Something catches his eye a vase of roses on the end
of the table A card in them says They didnt have the
whatever you wanted - Sam Enraged Riggan focuses on the
vase It begins to shift Then with a surge of anger
without ever touching it he sends it crashing against the
wall on the other side of the room

The camera pans over the roses scattered across the floor It
hovers over the carpet and around the perimeter of the room
until it finally settles on Riggan now dressed in a casual
blazer

AS

It is later the same day He is sitting on the sofa and on three

chairs in front of him are three journalists

Gabriel a geeky theatre journalist wearing thick glasses and
a thin tie Clara a reporter from an entertainment blog And
Han a polite obese Japanese journalist who sits next to his
translator another Japanese guy

GABRIEL
Why does somebody go from playing the lead
in a comic book franchise to adapting
Raymond Carver for the stage

Riggan tries to remain calm

GABRIEL (CONTD)
I mean as youre probably aware Barthes
said “The cultural work done in the past
by gods and epic sagas is now done by
laundry detergent commercials and comic
strip characters” Its a big leap youve
taken

Riggan shifts nervously

102914 12

RIGGAN
Well Absolutely As you said that
Barthes said Birdman like Icarus
CLARA

Hang on Whos this Barthes guy Which
Birdman was he in

GABRIEL
Roland Barthes was a French philosopher
who--

CLARA

Oh Okay Sure Now is it true you’ve been
injecting yourself with semen from baby

pigs
RIGGAN
What
CLARA
As a method of facial rejuvenation
RIGGAN
Who told you that
CLARA
It was tweeted by (checks her notes)
prostatewhispers
RIGGAN
Its a lie
CLARA
I know But did you do it
RIGGAN
No
GABRIEL

Are you afraid at all that people will say
youre doing this play to battle the
impression that youre a washed-up super
hero

RIGGAN
No I’m not And that’s exactly why
20 years ago I refused to do
Birdman 4

HAN
Birdman 4 You do Birdman 4

Jake opens the door and the camera pans to him

102914 13

JAKE
Okay Thats enough for today
Thank you for coming Were
expecting some great pieces from
you

Riggan stares at the Birdman poster

JAKE (CONTD)
Publicity guys are trying to get
you a Times feature

Riggan stands up and pulls the Birdman poster off of the
wall

JAKE (CONTD)
So Howd it-- Whoa If I were you
I wouldn’t do that

RIGGAN
I don’t want to look at it anymore

JAKE
That was a present from the crew
Dont fuck with those guys they’re
union

RIGGAN
I don’t care

Riggan leaves the poster on the floor facing the wall and
walks to the window He opens it We can hear distant drums
coming from the street

JAKE
So Howd it go
RIGGAN
Great
JAKE
(Worried )

Did they ask about Ralph

RIGGAN
Nope

JAKE

theater and onto

INT STAGE - THEATER - EVENING 7

the stage where she turns some of the stage work lights on
We pan along the stage until we find Riggan wearing the same
clothes as before scanning the empty auditorium

MIKE (0S)
Intimidating Isnt it

dressed with mussed hair and intense eyes

MIKE (CONTD)

RIGGAN
“Im the wrong person to ask I didnt

Mike stares at Riggan hyper-focused

Sam glances at Mike for a second then returns to her phone
Larry begins to help Mike into some pants which given the
situation is very awkward

Lesley enters the room immediately coming face to face with a
naked Mike She doesnt notice Sam who is partially hidden by a
clothes rack She just goes about trying a costume shirt

LESLEY

LAURA
(Unamused but plays along)

She puts her head on Riggans chest We see his mind racing
Laura is moved and confused

LAURA (CONTD)
Are you excited

RIGGAN
Yeah

LAURA

Laura moves slightly away from him and suddenly slaps him across
the face Riggan looks at her confused

RIGGAN
What--

LAURA
Youre not funny

She kisses him intensely on the lips and briefly places his
hand on her belly then moves it up to her breasts After a
moment she backs away

LAURA (CONTD)
First preview tomorrow Here we go

Laura turns and walks away Riggan continues down the
corridor He passes by a Security Guard in front of a small
TV The camera becomes Riggan’s POV and advances until

11 INT BACKSTAGE - THEATER - EVENING 11

we go through the stage door We scan the backstage area to
see the stagehands ready to do their jobs We can feel the
electricity of a first preview

On stage part of the kitchen set from before is visible Annie
stands at her podium calling the cues for the show

ANNIE
(Into her headset)
Cue 34 and 35 Go

102914 30

She turns and looks directly into the camera

ANNIE (CONTD)
Places

RIGGAN (0S)
Okay

Riggan walks on screen wearing his costume carrying a bucket of
ice and a bottle of gin He goes to the opposite side of the
stage and takes his place in the wings He peeks out at the
audience who seem to be watching with interest

Then we pan to the stage to find Mike Lesley and Laura
performing the scene we saw at the beginning around the table
Mike looks comfortable sipping at his drink A half empty
bottle of gin on the table

MIKE
The maniac shot himself right in front of
us I rode with him in the ambulance to the
hospital

LESLEY
I’ll never get that image out of my head
Right before he did it his eyes-- they
were so sad lonely

LAURA
Did you have to treat him

MIKE

I didn’t have to But I did

(Pouring another drink)
He was in bad shape His head swelled
up to like twice the size of a normal
head Id never seen anything like
it And I swear to God I hope I
never do again

Riggan stands near Annie

RIGGAN
He’s good

ANNIE
Hes incredible I think hes
drinking real gin

Riggan looks out at Mike who is refilling his glass

RIGGAN
What

102914 31

A stagehand gives Riggan a bottle Riggan watches and waits
for his cue

MIKE
Ask Nick what real love is Hell
agree with me You watch

LESLEY
Why don’t we just head to the
restaurant

LAURA
Don’t get him started Mel You
havent seen how he’s been lately
Hes been depressed I’m worried
about him He’s been-—

She gently pushes Riggan and we follow him on stage

INT STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 12

where Mike goes to refill his glass with the last of the
real gin Riggan snatches the bottle out of his hands and
gulps the rest straight from the bottle

RIGGAN
Been what (Beat) Ill tell you
what real love is This happened a
few months ago

(Drops bottle on table)
And it ought to make us ashamed
when we talk like we know what
were talking about when we talk
about love

LAURA
Nick for Gods sake Are you
getting drunk

RIGGAN
(Pointed at Mike)

I dont have to be drunk to say

what I think

MIKE
Nobody’s drunk We’re just having a
few drinks

LESLEY
Youve had more than a few

RIGGAN
What are you counting

102914 32

LAURA
Dont you talk to her like that
Don’t talk like a drunk if you’re
not--

RIGGAN

(Exploding )
Shut up For once in your life
Will you do me a favor and shut up
for a minute

(Beat )
Like I was saying Theres this
old couple had a car wreck out on
the interstate Some drunk kid
plowed his dads pick up into their
camper

We begin to hear the underscoring of violins

RIGGAN (CONTD)

Fucking teenager By the time I got
to the hospital the kid was dead
He was off in a corner laid out on
a gurney We took the old couple up
to the 0R They were a mess We
worked like hell on them for most
of the night

Over the speech Mike reaches for the new bottle that Riggan
placed on stage He refills his glass

RIGGAN (CONTD)
When we were done we wrapped them in full
body casts The husband was depressed
Even when I told him his wife was gonna
pull through he was still depressed So
I got up to his mouth hole and asked him
and he told me it was because he couldnt
see her through the eye holes Can you
imagine I’m telling you the mans heart
was breaking because he couldnt turn his
goddamn head and see his goddamn wife

Riggan is doing a good job Lesley and Laura are genuinely
moved Mike notices He sips his drink

RIGGAN (CONTD)
I mean It was killing him Killing him
that he--

MIKE
Im tired of this shit

They all look at Mike In silence

102914 33

MIKE (CONTD)
(to Riggan)
What the fuck is this Water

He hurls the glass against the wall Some laughter from the
audience Riggan stares at him confused He presses on

RIGGAN
It was killing the old bastard

MIKE
Did you just give me water

RIGGAN
Come on Mike

MIKE
Come on what

RIGGAN
Take it easy Youre drunk

MIKE
Of course Im drunk Im supposed to
be drunk This is Carver man The guy
lost a piece of liver every time he
wrote a page If I’m supposed to drink
gin then bring me fuckin gin I mean
you fucked the time period You took
all the good lines for yourself At
least let me--

The audience is now hysterical Dozens of cell phones
pointing at the stage Mike walks toward the apron facing
the audience

MIKE (CONTD)
Oh okay Seriously You people are
pathetic Put the cell phones down and
join the real world Will somebody
please just live in the real world

He crosses to the refrigerator

LAURA
Wheres he going
LESLEY

(Firmly )
Mike cut it out

Mike rummages through the fridge

102914 34

MIKE

Look at this It’s all fake
(Tossing items out of the
fridge)

The milk is fake The butter is fake

Riggan storms off the stage

MIKE (CONTD)
(To Riggan)
Your performance is fake
(He finds some fried
chicken )
Hey Theres chicken Real chicken The
only thing real up here is the chicken
So Im gonna stick with the chicken

The audience laughs harder

MIKE (0S) (CONT’D)
Hey this is good bird man

Riggan charges through the chaos backstage running into a
panicked Annie

RIGGAN
Get Mike out of here

ANNIE
How do you want me to do that

Riggan keeps walking up to

INT HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 13

the hallway Jake chases him

RIGGAN

Riggan comes to a halt and faces Jake

RIGGAN
No You listen to me Get him the fuck out
of my play Did you see him out there

JAKE
It was a preview Nobody gives a shit about
previews Nothing matters until that old
bat from the New York Times is sitting in
that audience on opening night

RIGGAN
Were getting rid of him I’m not going to
stand up on that stage and--

JAKE
Shut up Just shut up for once and
listen to me As soon as we announced he

respected validated remember Thats

director Get him under control

(A beat As a friend)
These are not the nineties anymore

Jake storms away Riggan heads toward his dressing room Out
of nowhere Mike barrels into him pinning him against a wall

RIGGAN
(Startled )
Holy Fuck

Mike presses up against Riggan breathing down his neck After a
painful silence

MIKE
(Like hes possessed)
You were good

RIGGAN
Meet me in front of the theater in
10 minutes

Mike chuckles and slaps Riggan gently on the face before he
disappears into his dressing room Riggan begins walking
again We follow him into

102914 36

INT RIGGANS DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 14

shis dressing room He goes into the bathroom and quickly
washes his face

SYLVIA (0S)
What the hell was going on up there

We pan over to see his ex-wife Sylvia standing in one
corner staring at Riggan She is elegant and simply beautiful

RIGGAN
I didnt know you were here tonight

SYLVIA
That guys an asshole huh

Riggan dries his hands with a towel and comes out of the
bathroom

RIGGAN
What are you doing here

SYLVIA

(Beat )
Riggan You dont have to be a great

RIGGAN

Suddenly Laura opens the door and sticks her head in
LAURA
(Noticing Sylvia)
Oh sorry

She closes the door Awkward silence

SYLVIA
So how is that going Is she and
Sam--

RIGGAN

I don’t wanna talk about it

102914 38

He goes to a small fridge takes out a beer and closes it

SYLVIA
Youre drinking

RIGGAN
Im having a beer

SYLVIA
Okay

He sits and sips in silence for a moment

take out the wig

RIGGAN
So whats going on with you

SYLVIA

Then he begins to

Me Nothing Everythings the same I guess

RIGGAN
I’m thinking about refinancing

SYLVIA

Riggan seems pensive and lost
SYLVIA

Riggan
(Beat )

102914 39

Riggan gently looks up to Sylvia

RIGGAN
I have a chance to do something right And I
have to take it I have to

SYLVIA
Its funny I was sitting here waiting
for you and all of a sudden I couldnt
remember why we broke up

Silence Then as if he hasn’t heard what she said

RIGGAN
The last time I flew here from LA George
Clooney was sitting two seats in front of
me With those cuff links and that
chin We ended up flying through this
really bad storm The plane started to
rattle and shake and everyone on board
was crying and praying And I just sat
there-- Sat there thinking that when Sam
opened that paper it was going to be
Clooneys face on the front page Not
mine (A beat) Did you know that Farrah
Fawcett died on the same day as Michael
Jackson

She smiles sadly She kisses him on the head and goes to the
door

RIGGAN (CONT’D)
Why did we break up

SYLVIA
(Looks him in the eye)
You threw a kitchen knife at me

Riggan is smacked by that memory His eyes on the floor

SYLVIA (CONTD)
and one hour later you were
telling me how much you loved me
(Beat )
Just because I didnt like that
ridiculous comedy you did with Goldie
Hawn didnt mean I did not love you
But thats what you always do You
confuse love with admiration

She smiles sadly He looks at her As Sylvia opens the door
she turns back to Riggan

102914 40

SYLVIA (CONTD)
Its your house so do what you want with
it Just make sure youre there for our
daughter

RIGGAN
I will

SYLVIA
Youre not Farrah Fawcett Riggan

She exits Painful silence until

BIRDMAN (VO)
We should have done that reality show they
offered us The Thomsons That wouldve
been good Crazy druggy wise ass daughter
Milfy wife with the perky tits People would
have watched that

RIGGAN

Riggan stands up and grabs his jacket He opens the door and
goes out to

Riggan walks between crew members Annie interrupts him

ANNIE
The sun bed is here

RIGGAN
What does that mean

ANNIE
It means theres a sun bed out there
being delivered to in here

RIGGAN
Who ordered a sun bed

102914 41

ANNIE
Mike He says it’s for his character
Carvers red necks “people of the
land” Part of his process and that
shit

Riggan cannot deal with this right now He continues walking
until he arrives at a metal door that takes him out to

EXT AN ALLEY WAY - OUTSIDE THE THEATER - CONTINUOUS 16

-an alley way Riggan walks toward the street There is a man
playing drums Riggan finds Mike leaning against a parked car
dazed and looking up at the marquis

RIGGAN
Let’s go Walk

Riggan begins to walk Mike follows

MIKE
Where are we going

RIGGAN
To get you some coffee Have I done
anything to disrespect you

MIKE
Not yet
RIGGAN
I have a lot riding on this play
MIKE
Is that right
RIGGAN
People know who I am and--
MIKE
Bullshit
RIGGAN
Mike--
MIKE

Bullshit People don’t know you They
know the guy in the bird suit They
know the guy who tells those quaint
slightly vomitous stories on Letterman

RIGGAN
Well I’m sorry for being popular but
that--

102914

MIKE
(With irony)
Popular POPULAR Oh God popularity is
just the slutty little cousin of prestige

RIGGAN
Okay I don’t even know what that--
MIKE
My reputation is riding on this play
And thats That is
RIGGAN
A lot
MIKE

A lot Exactly Fuck you Yes This
doesnt work out for you you get to go
home to your studio pals and jump right
back into that cultural genocide you
guys are perpetrating “Theres a
douchbag born every minute” That was
PT Barnum’s premise when he got rich
inventing the circus And you and your
pals know nothings changed and
whatever toxic shit you make people are
still gonna pay to see it But after
youre gone I’ll still be here 111
still be making my living on the stage
Baring my soul Wrestling with emotions
complex emotions

RIGGAN
Right Is that what tonight was about then
(Mocking him) Wrestling with “complex
emotions”

MIKE
Tonight was about making it alive About
making it bleed This isnt the Warner
Brothers lot Riggan This is the city and
this is how we do things

Mike turns and opens the front door of The Rum House

RIGGAN
Where are you going

MIKE
They have coffee in here

He walks into the restaurant Riggan backtracks and we follow

him into

102914 43

INT RUM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 17

The Rum House Mike stands at the bar the bartender
already pouring two whiskeys

MIKE
(To bartender )
Thanks Tommy

Tommy nods and walks away

RIGGAN
(Getting back on point)
People were laughing in our faces

MIKE
(Handing Riggan a drink)
Tonight they were laughing tomorrow

‘em Who cares These are the people who
pay half price to watch us rehearse Stop
fucking caring

RIGGAN
Were doing Raymond Carver This play is a
drama This play is--

MIKE
You dont know what this play is These are
previews This is where we find out what
the play is

Mike points to an Older Woman sitting at the bar She sips a
martini and scribbles in a notebook with a sour expression

MIKE (CONTD)
You see that woman over there The one that
looks like she just licked a homeless guy’s
ass Nothing matters until she writes five
hundred words about us in the New York Times

RIGGAN
Thats

MIKE
Tabitha Dickinson Yes And believe it or
not the only thing that matters in theater
is whether she likes us or not She does
we run She doesnt were fucked

RIGGAN
(Preoccupied )

She does look like she licked a homeless

guy’s ass

102914 44

MIKE
Do me a favor dont get your panties in a
twist over a preview alright And dont tell
me how to do my job Cause this is my town
And to be honest nobody gives a shit about
you around here

LADY (0S)
Youre Riggan Thompson right

Two fat tourists in Mamma Mia t-shirts with a seven year old
kid approach the table

HUSBAND
(Timidly)
Were sorry to interrupt

LADY
Would you mind terribly if we got a
picture

RIGGAN
Of course Its no trouble at all

The Lady shoves her camera into Mikes hands

LADY
(To Mike)
Would you mind

Mike gets up with a blank expression and takes the camera
The Lady pushes the kid into the booth next to Riggan

LADY (CONTD)
(Ordering Mike)
The button right on top there

KID
Who is this guy

LADY
(To his son)
Come on Billy He used to be like Batman

She yanks the kid closer and they squeeze up against Riggan
Mike takes the photo and holds the camera to the lady

LADY (CONTD)
(To Mike)

I think you screwed that one up Take
another one

Mike takes another picture

102914 45

LADY (CONT’D)
(To Riggan)

God bless you darlin’ Youre very sweet

And handsome

She kisses Riggan hard on the mouth Then gets up giddy and
takes her son by the hand As the couple leaves husband shoves
a five dollar bill into Mike’s hands

HUSBAND
We really appreciate it

An agitated Mike takes a sip of whiskey

MIKE
Are we good here Cause I’m gonna go

RIGGAN
See you tomorrow

Mike places the dollar under one of the shot glasses and begins
to walk away but then stops and turns curiously

MIKE
Why Raymond Carver You never told me

Riggan looks at Mike for a second than reaches for his wallet
and produces an old cocktail napkin with some writing on it He
slides it to Mike

RIGGAN
A long time ago I did a play back in
high school in Michigan He was in the
audience He sent this backstage after

MIKE

Thank you for an honest performance Ray
Carver What is this

Riggan looks vulnerable He is trying to make Mike understand
the importance of the napkin to build a bridge between them

RIGGAN
And thats when I knew I was going to
be an actor

Mike cant stop himself from smiling

RIGGAN (CONT’D)
Why is that funny

MIKE
He wrote it on a cocktail napkin

102914 46

RIGGAN
So

Mike slides the napkin back to Riggan

MIKE
He was drunk

Al7 Al7
He walks away and we follow him as he passes by the bar next
to Tabitha Dickinson the Critic

TABITHA
You headed to Hollywood Mike

Mike stops

MIKE
Hollywoods headed here Tabby

TABITHA
(A devilish smile)
Good luck with that

Mike looks directly into her eyes

MIKE
A man becomes a critic when he can not be an
artist in the same way that a man becomes an
informer when he cannot be a soldier

Flaubert right

He flashes his own devilish smile She stares back If she
werent so much older than him youd swear there was sexual
electricity between them

TABITHA
Hes a Hollywood clown in a Lycra bird
suit

MIKE

Yeah And at 8 oclock tomorrow hes gonna
get on stage and risk everything Whatre
you gonna be doing

A standoff

TABITHA
Dont you ever worry that Ill give you a
bad review

102914 47

MIKE
Oh Im sure you will If I ever give a bad
performance

(Beat )
Ms Dickinson

TABITHA
Mr Shiner

Mike smiles and waves over to an obviously nervous Riggan He
goes toward the exit but we stay with Tabitha scribbling on
her notebook Suddenly she raises her eyes and with a dark
expression looks at Riggan who is passing by

We follow Riggan toward the exit Through the window we see him
leave the restaurant Then we pan to a wooden wall and this
wall takes us to

INT HALLWAY - THEATER - LATER 19

the theater hallway Riggan walks through the quiet corridor
until he arrives at

INT GREEN ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 20

the Green Room Sam sits listlessly drawing some lines
across a roll of toilet paper

RIGGAN
Whatre you still doing here

SAM

(Continues scribbling)
Nothing I’m-- Nothing Your costumes are

RIGGAN
Great

SAM

What is that

RIGGAN
Look at me

He examines her eyes then immediately rises scouring

SAM

RIGGAN
(Continuing to search)
You have to be shitting me Where is it

SAM
Could we not do this

Riggan pulls a jar of peanut butter from the trash

RIGGAN
What is this

SAM
That is chunky peanut butter that happens
by the way to have Omega--

102914

Riggan pulls a stubbed joint out of the jar

RIGGAN

SAM
Oh Thats pot

RIGGAN
Dont try to--

SAM

RIGGAN
Listen to me Im trying to do something
thats important

SAM
This is not important

RIGGAN
Its important to me Alright Maybe not to
you or your cynical playmates whose sole
ambition is to end up going viral and who
by the way will only be remembered as the
generation that finally stopped talking to

one another But to me To me This is--
God This is my career this is my chance
(MORE)

102914 50
RIGGAN (CONTD)
to do some work that actually means
something

SAM
Means something to who You had a career
before the third comic book movie before
people began to forget who was inside the
bird costume Youre doing a play based on
a book that was written 60 years ago for
a thousand rich old white people whose
only real concern is gonna be where they
go to have their cake and coffee when its
over Nobody gives a shit but you And
lets face it Dad its not for the sake
of art Its because you just want to feel
relevant again Well theres a whole
world out there where people fight to be
relevant every day And you act like it
doesnt even exist Things are happening
in a place that you willfully ignore a
place that has already forgotten you I
mean who are you You hate bloggers You
make fun of twitter You dont even have a
Facebook page Youre the one who doesnt
exist Youre doing this because youre
scared to death like the rest of us that
you dont matter And you know what
Youre right You dont Its not
important Youre not important Get used
to it

Silence Riggan seems devastated and Sam can see that

Sam (CONTD)
Dad

She looks at him sympathetically but not knowing what to
say exits

After a moment Riggan gets up and heads for the trash can He
digs out the roach grabs some matches and lights it Music
begins to sound He inhales deeply and holds the smoke for a
few seconds and finally exhales He coughs tosses away the
joint and heads out of the kitchen We follow him

INT HALLWAY - THEATRE - CONTINUOUS 21

as he slowly walks until he disappears into the darkness of
the corridor We keep moving forward until we end up
102914 51

A21 INT BACKSTAGE - THEATRE - EVENING A21

backstage We are in the middle of the second preview The
music continues it belongs to the play

Laura is by herself on stage performing the end of a scene She
stands in the middle of a surrealistic forest set at dusk
There is fog and trees A strong artificial wind blows
through Laura’s hair Desolate music

LAURA

(To the audience as soliloquy )
In the days before Nick’s depression really
started to eat away at him he had no idea
I was pregnant And I never intended on
telling him I guess we make choices in
life and we choose to live with them or
not I didn’t want that baby

Three dancers on stage pass by in front of Laura We follow
the dancers backstage where we find Mike and Lesley wearing
pajamas

LAURA (0S) (CONT’D)
Not because I didn’t love Nick And not
because I didn’t love the-- The idea of
it But because I just wasn’t ready to
love myself There’s a certain distance to
it all now A wistful distance
Underscored by a gentle breeze and the
sound of the birds laughing at the
whimsy of it all

A stage hand helps Mike and Lesley into a double bed The
camera slips under the covers with them and stays there

MIKE
(Whispering )
Hey Les
LESLEY
(Whispering )
What
MIKE
Im hard
LESLEY

No youre not Its just that sometimes
you dont consider other peoples feelings

MIKE
No Im hard Feel

102914 52

LESLEY
Oh you gotta be kidding

The stage begins to revolve as we hear

INT STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 22
music through the transition It remains dark

MIKE
Lets really do this Lets fuck

LESLEY
Are you crazy No

Mike rolls on top of Lesley

LESLEY (CONTD)
Cut it out

Mike continues to maneuver himself

LESLEY (CONTD)
Im serious Mike Stop

MIKE
Im Mel Not Mike Mel

A knock on a door

RIGGAN (0S)
Terri Terri

A furious Lesley tries to reposition herself under Mike

RIGGAN (0S) (CONTD)
Terri I know youre in there

The knocking gets louder

RIGGAN (0S) (CONTD)
Terri

Mike lost in his libido has begun to have sex with Lesley
The camera comes out from under the covers and pans to Riggan
who stumbles into what is now the Motel Room set He wears a
mustache and a long wig that makes him look like a wild man
He holds a gun in his right hand A neon Motel sign is
illuminated A clever effect of falling rain is visible behind
the set accompanied by the appropriate sound effect Riggan
is wet because of the rain

Lesley uses Riggans entrance to escape from Mike

102914 53

LESLEY
Ed

Mike hops out of bed unaware of the very noticeable erection
protruding underneath his pajama bottoms

Some laughter from the audience

LESLEY (CONTD)
What are you doing here

Lesley doesnt understand the audience response until she
notices the erection herself

RIGGAN
(To Lesley)

Why I need you to tell me why I lived for

you I worshipped you

MIKE
Listen Ed I know this is hard but--

More laughter Riggan is disturbed but he continues

RIGGAN
(to Mike)
Fuck you Shut up Fuck you

He shoves Mike violently to the floor

(A revelation )

Riggan points the gun at Lesley Then at Mike Finally he puts
the gun to his own head and pulls the trigger PUM And with the
explosion a fake blood mechanism splatters brains onto the
stage Riggan drops to the floor

A blackout The audience applauds politely The curtain falls
We follow Riggan off stage and into

INT BACKSTAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 23

the wings where Annie immediately helps him remove the
bloody and wet wig with the propeller mechanism Laura waits
next to them for their bows Meanwhile a stage hand crosses
behind them and we follow him as he goes on stage to

INT STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 24

reposition some scenery for the curtain call The camera
carries us to the other side of the stage where Mike and Lesley
are in a heated exchange

MIKE
Just keep your voice down

LESLEY

(Furious )

LESLEY

Music begins and the curtain rises The audience applauds as
Lesley and Mike stride onto the stage and take their bows
smiles plastered on their faces

MIKE
-I was in the moment

LESLEY
I told you to stop You fucking animal

MIKE
But You were incredible

LESLEY
What is wrong with you

Lesley starts back for the wings and Mike follows her In the
background we see Riggan and Laura enter from the other side to
take their bows

MIKE

LESLEY

They go back on stage and join Riggan and Laura for the company
bow

MIKE

INT LESLEY AND LAURAS DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS

the dressing room and closes the door Lesley proceeds to
smash everything on her dressing table Then she looks in the
mirror holding a hairbrush

LESLEY
Why dont I have any self-respect

LAURA

Lesley begins to cry Laura hugs her

LESLEY
I’m pathetic You know I’ve dreamt of

Laura kisses Lesley tenderly on the lips Lesley seems
confused A few seconds of silence Then

LESLEY
Do it again

Laura kisses her again A knock at the door They separate
Mike opens the door holding the prop gun

MIKE
(To Lesley)

Lesley hurls the hair brush at his head

LESLEY

Mike points the prop gun at her pretends to fire and

MIKE (CONTD)

He exits the room We follow him

INT HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 27

down the hallway up to Riggans dressing room Riggan sits
at his table picking the brains out of his hair

102914 59

MIKE
(Holding the gun)
Your gun is ridiculous It looks like a
plastic toy And it still has the red plug
in the barrel
(Shows the plug)
You look like a seven year old when
youre holding it Im not threatened
by it at all

He tosses the gun onto Riggans table
MIKE (CONTD)
Have some self respect and get a new one
(Takes a step then turns)
That was a fun crowd huh

We follow Mike to

INT STAIRS - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 28
the stairs He climbs them as he lights a cigarette He goes
through a metal door that takes him out onto

EXT ROOFTOP - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 29

a rooftop The Marquis’ of the other theaters glowing with
the street lamps a classic Broadway view

Mike is surprised to find Sam sitting on the cornice of the
building a good fifty feet above 45th street He goes next to
her looking down at the street

MIKE
I dont think its high enough

Sam turns to him uncomfortable by his presence

SAM
Me neither
MIKE
So what are you doing up here

Mike leans on the railing looking down at the street For a
moment he is somewhere else

him )

She stares into Mikes eyes knowing shes being tested She
leans over the railing and spits down toward the street

SAM
(Taken aback)

MIKE
Thats a second question

SAM

A pause

MIKE

Impressed with his honesty

SAM
That didnt seem to be a problem for you on

MIKE
Nothing’s a problem for me on stage
SAM
I wanna ask another question
MIKE
You just asked--
SAM

MIKE
Go ‘head
SAM

He carefully considers it then moves his face close to hers

MIKE
I would want to pull the eyes out of your
head

SAM

MIKE
And stick them in my skull and then
look out at this street and see it the way
I saw it when I was your age

A29

B29

102914 64

Mike turns and stares out at the street once more Sam stares
at the mystery that is Mike

SAM
Gnight Mike

She walks away and into the building never looking back

A29

Mike stares out into the night We move to his POV The street
Night turns to day Pedestrians begin to walk below

B29

We crawl down the wall until we arrive at Riggans dressing
room window We push in to find

INT RIGGANS DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - DAY 30

Riggan siting with his feet on the window frame staring at
a manila envelope in his hands that reads R MALIBU
REFINANCE DOCS SIGN AND SEND ASAP J Riggan sighs and props
the letter up against the mirror

With a soft knock Laura enters She stands in the doorway with
an odd expression on her face

RIGGAN
What now

Laura lays the Arts section of the New York Times down in front
of Riggan

LAURA
Dont kill the messenger

Riggan picks up the paper His expression immediately changes
Laura watches him sympathetically

LAURA (CONTD)
Hes an asshole

Now we see the cover of the Arts section There is a picture
of Mike lounging on a black sofa his bare feet on a table as
he sips a glass of wine The Title of the article reads
CARVING OUT HIS PLACE IN THEATER HISTORY Shiner says Raymond
Carver is the reason he became an actor Riggan involuntarily
squeezes the paper as he reads on filling with rage

BIRDMAN (V0)
He’s fooling you

102914 65

RIGGAN
Shut up
LAURA
(Confused )

I didnt say anything

RIGGAN
Fuck This is it

(He passes a few pages)
This cant be it

LAURA
Page twelve

Riggan searches desperately for page twelve When he gets
there he finds a huge ad of the new Toyota Camry that almost
fills the entire page and down in the left corner a tiny
press release with the title

Prom Birdman to Carver An aging Action Hero Grasps for His
Youth

RIGGAN
(Reading )
Riggan Thompson better known as the face of
the Birdman films tries not to lay an egg on
Broadway
(Flipping pages)
Wheres the rest of it

LAURA
There is no rest of it

RIGGAN
They didn’t use the photo I sent them

RIGGAN

LAURA

Laura looks at him with fire in her eyes

LAURA
Youre an asshole

She charges to the door and is about to leave when she turns
back to Riggan

LAURA (CONTD)
By the way Im not pregnant So theres
one thing you don’t have to worry about

She leaves slamming the door behind her

Riggan remains still Mike seems to be smirking at him right
through the cover of the Arts section

BIRDMAN (V0)
That pretentious little theater fuck is
stealing your thunder

Riggan charges out of the room and into

INT HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 31

the hallway He walks to Mikes dressing room finds the
door half opened and enters

INT MIKES DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 32

discovering Mike lying in a sun bed His arm is sticking
out of it holding on to a copy of Borgess ‘Labyrinths

Riggan yanks the sun bed open Mike is asleep wearing tiny
sun goggles Riggan slams the lid down on him

102914 67

MIKE
What the fuck is going on
RIGGAN

Get up
MIKE
Back away
RIGGAN

Get up

Riggan slaps Mike on the arm

MIKE
ow fuck that hurts

RIGGAN
So Carver is the reason you became an
actor

MIKE

RIGGAN

This is my play I did the work I raised the
money I arrange the press

MIKE
They called me for an interview I said-- I

the Arts section

RIGGAN
You said the first-- Fuck the Arts section
The first thing that came to mind Right

scene just stare at my massive hard-on
Because thats the truth of the moment

MIKE
You think it looked massive

RIGGAN
Shut up Shut the fuck up You dont get
hard on my stage unless I tell you to

MIKE
Your stage This stage belonged to a lot of
great actors pal But you are not one of
them

Mike storms out of the room Riggan follows him into

102914

INT HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS
the hallway He slaps Mike on his sun burned back

RIGGAN
So you wrote your own lines

He slaps him again

MIKE

little you self absorbed prick

MIKE
Look whos talking

RIGGAN

RIGGAN
Fifty thousand views A cat playing with

(Beat )
Everybody says Mike is so honest (Smacks
him) So truthful (Smacks him again)

MIKE
(Like a child)
Ouch Fuuuuuck Cut the shit

Riggan corners Mike against the wall

RIGGAN
You said in the interview that your father
was a drunk like Carver Is that true
Mike Is it really true

Riggan stares intensely into Mikes eyes Mike looks away

102914 69

RIGGAN (CONTD)
Because my father was My father was a mean
fucking drunk Beat the shit out of us But
we were okay with the beatings You know
why Because at least when he was beating
us he wasnt thinking about taking us out
to his tool shed

Mikes expression changes

RIGGAN (CONTD)
That sonofabitch would smile and say Do
you want to kneel down and unbuckle my
belt Or do you want me to take it off and
use it I learned how to make myself numb
But my sister-- (Holding back tears) My
little sister

Riggan cant go on Mike is horrified

MIKE
Jesus Riggan Im really sorry I

RIGGAN
(Crazy smile)

up) I can pretend too you little dick

Riggan shoves Mike violently

RIGGAN (CONTD)
Dont fuck with me Mike

MIKE
Youre crazy

RIGGAN

You have no idea what Im capable of You
understand me

Riggan pulls the paper out of his back pocket
RIGGAN (CONTD)
Working with Riggan Thomson is like

waltzing with a monkey

He smacks Mike in the head with the paper and begins to jump in
front of him ready to fight

RIGGAN (CONTD)
Let’s go Put your hands up

102914 70

MIKE

(Tauntingly )
Dont you want to go put on your tights and
your-—

Riggan punches him on the face Mike needs a few seconds to
understand what has just happened Then they begin to wrestle
in the hallway Mike breaks free from the headlock

MIKE (CONTD)

What are you gonna do You gonna get rid of
me Huh What do you think my friend
Tabitha is going to write in the Times
after you get rid of me

Riggan stares at Mike paralyzed by the truth Finally he
turns and marches to his dressing room and we follow him

INT RIGGANS DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 34

Riggan slams the door shut and paces in a rage He glares at
a make-up box on the table and points his finger at it and
sends it flying across the room

BIRDMAN (VO)
You are lame Riggan Rolling around
with that third rate actor in an 800
seat shithole like this

RIGGAN

(Whispering )
Breathing in I feel my rage Breathing
out I embrace my mental formations

BIRDMAN (V0)
Youre going to let that poncey theater
fuck threaten you

Riggan continues breathing deeply with his eyes tightly closed
He smiles a tiny artificial smile

RIGGAN
(Whispering )
Breathing in I am calm Breathing out
I ignore my mental formations This is a
mental formation This is a mental form--

BIRDMAN (VO)
Stop that shit I am not a mental
formation I am you asshole

Riggan looks down at the poster on the floor

Riggan points his fingers at a lamp and

102914

RIGGAN
(Whispering )
Leave me alone

BIRDMAN (V0)
You were a movie star remember
Pretentious but happy

RIGGAN
I was not happy

BIRDMAN
Ignorant but charming Now you are a
tiny bitter cocksucker

RIGGAN

his shirt) This is whats left

chest) This (Totally exploding) Im

fucking trivial pursuit question

Riggan sits down exhausted

sends it flying

Riggan points his fingers at a chair and sends it flying

Riggan opens his eyes slowly A sad expression on his face

102914 72

RIGGAN (CONTD)
What part of that dont you get Youre

BIRDMAN (V0)
We are not dead Were--

RIGGAN
Stop saying we There is no we I am
not you Im Riggan fucking Thomson

BIRDMAN (VO)
No Youre Birdman Because without me all
thats left is you A sad selfish
mediocre actor grasping--

Riggan points his finger and sends the poster flying spearing
it on a coat rack piercing Birdman right through the heart
Finally silence Until

BIRDMAN (V0)
What the hell did you do that for I liked
that poster

A confused Riggan looks over to the wall where the lamp on the
floor is creating a shadow of his figure Only in the shadow it
appears as if Riggan is wearing the Birdman costume Stunned
Riggan slowly lifts one arm and in the shadow we see a wing

BIRDMAN (VO)
Its always we brother

The television turns on by itself playing an episode of the
original Birdman cartoon Riggan points his fingers at the tv
and sends it hurling at the shadow Then he proceeds to
destroy everything in his room with his telekinetic powers

We slowly pan to see that behind Riggan Jake stands on the
other side of the half-opened door We push in on Jake
watching in shock The camera turns and becomes Jakes POV

INT HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 35
and now from his view we see Riggan yelling at the shadow

RIGGAN
Fuck you Fuck you

He picks up a chair and throws it down He then picks up the
newspaper from the floor and tossing it all around And now we
understand that he is not using telepathy He has been using
only his hands Completely mad As Riggan turns to pick up
something else he spots Jake on the other side of the door He
immediately calms himself and walks over

102914 73

RIGGAN (CONTD)
Whats up

JAKE

seems about to collapse)

Riggan nods An exhausted sadness in his eyes

RIGGAN

JAKE

RIGGAN

JAKE

laugh) Good one Riggan

102914 74

RIGGAN
I’m starting to believe that this is not

think they’re laughing at me

JAKE
What are you-- Listen Theres a three
block line of people waiting to see you
We are sold out It’s a full house

RIGGAN

RIGGAN
Okay I’l1l be ready

Riggan smiles He has forgotten about his existential doubts
A worried Jake closes the door He walks a few steps and
finds Laura and Lesley They’ve been listening to his

conversation with Riggan

LESLEY
How is he
JAKE
Hell be okay
LESLEY
Poor creature
LAURA

LESLEY
So there is no line of people out there

JAKE
I don’t know Now go and get ready
Thats your job
(He begins to walk)
I’ll better invest in a taco truck or
a strip joint near the airport

Laura leaves We follow Lesley up to Riggan’s dressing room
She knocks on the door Nothing Silence She half-opens the
door and from behind her we see Riggan examining his right
hand He has blood falling from the palm to the wrist

LESLEY
Are you okay

RIGGAN
(Smiles )
Yeah I-- This is nothing Shaving

He cleans his hand against his trousers

LESLEY
I just want to say Im sorry

RIGGAN
For what

LESLEY
I knew what Mike was capable of
and I brought him in anyway

RIGGAN
You did good

Lesley nods A beat

LESLEY
Tomorrows my first opening night
on Broadway

LESLEY
And I want you to know that
whatever happens Ill always be
grateful to you for that

RIGGAN

Me too It’s going to be great Full
house

102914 76

She looks at him with tender eyes Then we follow her along
the corridor until she passes by Mike’s dressing room Mike
half-opens the door and sees Lesley walking by He has a
black eye He waits for Lesley to be completely gone and
then he comes out of his dressing room and we follow him up
the stairs to

EXT ROOFTOP - THEATER - DUSK 38

the rooftop He finds Sam standing on the cornice looking
at the street

MIKE
For fucks sake just jump already

Sam stares out a smile creeping over her face

SAM
How did you know Id be up here

MIKE
I didnt I was just hoping

Silence Mike walks up next to her and stares out as well

SAM
Wheres Lesley

MIKE
Moving on

SAM
smart girl

MIKE

A beat

SAM
Ready for the last preview

(Noticing his black eye)
Who did that to you

Mike smiles No answer
SAM (CONTD)
Could have been anybody I guess
(After a beat)
I’m sort of hoping it was Lesley
He barely says no smiling and lights a cigarette She
understands

102914 77

SAM (CONTD)
Oh don’t tell me

Silence

MIKE
Whats the worst thing he ever did to
you

Sam is surprised by the question She thinks for a moment

SAM
He was never around so

MIKE
That was--

SAM

No That was-- Who gives a shit It
was the way he tried to make up for
it by constantly trying to convince
me I was special (A beat) What
about you

MIKE
My dad

SAM
Yeah

MIKE

He pretended I was his son

She stares him down Silence

SAM

So what happens now
MIKE

I have no idea
SAM

Yeah

A beat

MIKE

He was right though

SAM
About what

MIKE
About your being special Youre hanging
around here trying to make yourself

(MORE )

102914 78
MIKE (CONTD)
invisible behind that fragile little fuck
up routine But you can’t Youre
anything but invisible Youre big And
youre sort of this really great mess a
candle burning at both ends and no
amount of booze or pills is gonna hide
that

Sam tosses Mike’s cigarette over the balcony and kisses him
He leans into the kiss

MANS VOICE
(From below )
Jesus Fuck

She suddenly pulls away

SAM
Its a good thing youre an actor and not a
writer cause that little speech was just
like Oprah Hallmark R Kelly bad

She kisses him lightly one more time and then walks away When
she gets to the door she stops and leans on the frame

SAM (CONTD)
Truth or dare
MIKE
Truth
SAM
No
MIKE
Truth
SAM

No Truth or dare
The slightest smile as she exits through the door and after a
short pause Mike follows
INT HALLWAYS - THEATRE - CONTINUOUS 39

along a darkened hallway They reach a tiny wooden door and
Sam leads the way through it

MIKE
Do you have any idea where youre going

SAM
Absolutely not

102914 79

She continues on until she gets to

INT ABOVE STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 40
the grid above stage where the lights are located We can
see below us the empty seats of the auditorium and the
kitchen set

MIKE
What now

Mike reaches up to kiss her She stops him

SAM
How do you do it

MIKE
What

SAM

How do you go out there and pretend to be
someone else in front of all those people

MIKE
I dont pretend Not out there Just about
every place else but never out there

SAM
Good to know

They stare at one another

MIKE
What are we doing here

SAM
What do you mean

MIKE
I mean what are we doing here

She moves in

SAM
Adrenaline

They kiss The camera begins to drift down toward the stage

RIGGAN (0S)
Fucking teenager

As the camera continues down from the grid we discover an
auditorium full of people staring at the actors on stage

102914 80

RIGGAN (0S) (CONTD)

By the time I got to the hospital the

kid was dead He was off in a corner
laid out on a gurney We took the old
couple up to the 0R They were a
mess We worked like hell on them for
most of the night

We pan along the auditorium back to the stage to find Riggan
Mike Lesley and Laura in the kitchen

RIGGAN (CONTD)

When we were done we wrapped them in
full body casts The husband was
depressed Even when I told him his
wife was gonna pull through he was
still depressed So I got up to his
mouth hole and asked him and he told
me it was because he couldnt see her

through the eye holes Can you imagine

I’m telling you the mans heart was
breaking because he couldnt turn his
goddamn head and see his goddamn wife

LESLEY
(In genuine tears)
Thats terrible (Beat) Perfect
And terrible

She is crushed Laura holds Lesley trying to control her own

emotion

RIGGAN
(Taking this in)
Yeah So I guess what we have to
ask ourselves is What do we talk
about when we talk about love

The lights go to a blackout and the audience applauds as some
scene change music plays As we follow Riggan off stage the
lights are turned on again but now they have an orange mood

Lesley is the only one on stage doing a monologue

LESLEY
Mel and I have been together five
years been married for four But
it was Ed who taught me something
no one else could He taught me
what it felt like to really feel
loved And the terrible thing is
that if something happened to Mel
or myself if something happened to

else soon enough All this-- All of
this love we’re talking about it
would just be a memory Maybe not
even a memory Am I wrong I mean
I don’t know anything And I’m the
first one to admit it

A Dresser waits in the wings to help Riggan with his change

DRESSER
That was amazing

Riggan looks proud Things are finally going well He undresses
to his underwear and puts on a robe and his moccasins as the
stage begins to revolve Laura in costume walks up beside
him Over the following dialogue the kitchen gives way to the
extravagant garden set we saw before

LAURA
(A bit distant)
Its actually going well

RIGGAN
Yeah (A beat) Hey I think we have to
talk

LAURA

(Sad smile)
No We dont

Riggan nods

RIGGAN

Right (Beat) We will eventually
though ‘cause that’s the only way I get
to say I’m sorry I really am

Silence

LAURA
We couldve made good parents

RIGGAN
Horrible We wouldve been just--

LAURA
Awful Would have raised like

102914 82
LAURA (CONTD)
Im not really the housewife type anyway I
thought I could be a mom My body seems to
disagree

The lights come up and Laura walks onto the stage

LAURA(CONT’D-
Backto him
ght-—Thiswas£

Riggan watches her go but something else grabs his attention
We pan across the stage to see Sam and Mike on the other side
They talk and laugh Sam kisses Mike softly Mike playfully
grabs her ass

We pan back to Riggan His expression morphs from broken-
hearted to rage He marches over to a stage hand

RIGGAN
You have a cigarette

The stage hand holds out a pack Riggan takes one

STAGE HAND
You need a light

Riggan snatches the lighter and storms out through the hallway
and out the back door of the theater to

EXT AN ALLEY WAY - OUTSIDE THE THEATER - CONTINUOUS 41

the alley Down at the end we can see the tourists making
their way about the streets Riggan lights the cigarette and
leans back against the stage door trying to calm himself

RIGGAN
Breathing in I calm myself Breathing out
I ease myself

But this is New York City A fluorescent light buzzes above his
head Taxis honk their horns The sound of pedestrians yelling
at one another All fueling his agitation

Riggan checks his watch He pulls one last drag from the
cigarette before he tosses it and turns to head back in only
to realize the door has locked He tries to pull it open to no
avail He begins to knock loudly on the door There is no
response He knocks louder Nothing

He is turning to walk away when he realizes that his robe is
caught in the door He checks his watch again and now is
beginning to panic He tries to tear at the robe but the terry
cloth is too strong for him to rip Frantically he looks around
for an answer No answer No time He pulls the robe off of him

102914 83

and wearing only his underwear and moccasins he charges down
the alley way toward
EXT STREET - CONTINUOUS 42

the street Now rushing down the block in his underwear A
tourist spots him

TOURIST
Hey arent you

RIGGAN
Im sorry I cant really-—-

TOURIST
Riggan Thompson Holy Shit Let me get an

autograph

Riggan marches on as a few more people begin to notice The
Tourist runs in front of him forcing him to stop

TOURIST (CONTD)
Come on man Dont be a dick Let me have
an autograph

The man produces a pen and a magazine from his pocket More
people begin to gather

MAN ON STREET
Birdman

Seeing no other way out Riggan signs the autograph

TOURIST
Dude You fuckin rock

Directly in front of him stand a lady and her two kids

LADY
Can we take one picture

RIGGAN
Are you kidding me

KID 1
Why is he naked

LADY
One picture

KID 2

102914 84

Riggan tries to get past them but a crowd has formed A swarm
of cell phones begin to glow like fireflies

LADY
(To her kids)
Get next to him

RIGGAN
Give me a fucking break lady

The kids run up next to him Even more people crowding around
Riggan puts up his middle finger just as the Lady takes the
shot He shoves the kids aside and moves on

WOMAN ON STREET
He looks so old in person

MAN ON STREET
(From across the street)
You suck

RIGGAN
Fuck you

Riggan pushes through the crowd to get to the lobby The people
begin to chant Dozens of cell phones recording him

CROWD
Bird-man Bird-man Bird-man

Riggan pushes his way through to the lobby doors

INT LOBBY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 43

to be stopped by the vision of Ralph in a wheelchair His
head wrapped in a bandage A man in a suit next to him

RIGGAN

Jesus Christ Whatre you doing here
RALPH

Waiting for Jake This is Mr Roth my

attorney

Riggan continues walking toward the auditorium Ralph and Mr
Roth follow him

MR ROTH
Were pursuing financial remuneration for the
injuries Mr Pinkus suffered while rehearsing
your--

RIGGAN
I have a play to do

102914 85

RALPH

Riggan storms toward the auditorium but is stopped by an old
Usher

OLD USHER
Im sorry sir youre going to have--

Riggan shoves the old lady aside and enters

INT AUDITORIUM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 44

the theater Riggan stands in the back among the audience
He sees the rain falling on the stage The Motel sign is
lit Mike and Lesley are in bed for the motel scene waiting
for the knock on the door With nothing else to do Riggan
yells his line from the back of the auditorium

RIGGAN
Knock knock knock Terri Terri

The audience turns to see Riggan standing in his underwear
They begin to murmur and laugh and point at him

Riggan marches down the aisle He looks haggard and covered
with perspiration

Lesley and Mike confused come out of bed

LESLEY
Ed What are you doing here

RIGGAN
Why I need you to tell me why I lived for
you-- I worshipped you

MIKE
Listen Ed I know this is hard but--

RIGGAN
Fuck you Shut up Fuck you

Giggles from the audience Riggan turns threateningly and points
to an audience member on the aisle who is giggling at him

RIGGAN (CONTD)
Shut up

The guy stops smiling The audience goes silent Riggan arrives

at the apron of the stage Annie from the wings slides the gun
towards him Riggan grabs it and points it at Mike

102914 86

LESLEY
Eddie Please

Riggan climbs onto the stage Exhausted He goes to Mike and
with a last effort pushes him lamely

RIGGAN
Whats wrong with me Why do I end
up having to beg people to love me

LESLEY
Ed Eddie Please Give me the gun

We pan to the wings where Jake is staring in disbelief His
cellphone begins to vibrate and he answers

JAKE
Yeah (A beat) What No no no no no no
no Wait there Im coming out in--

He walks toward the hallway and we follow him

INT HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 45
through the corridor

JAKE
No Wait Wait for me Ill be there in a
second (Beat) What is that a threat
(Beat) What wheelchair (Beat) Wait
Dont hang up Mr Roth we can discuss—-
Hello Hello

He goes out one of the exits and we are left with the silence of
the empty hallway After a few seconds the sound of the gunshot
from the scene echoes through the theater The audience
applauds The camera starts to move forward A few seconds later
Riggan takes over the POV with his bloody long wig and the fake
gun We follow up to

INT RIGGANS DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 46

shis dressing room He puts on a robe He walks to his
refrigerator without acknowledging Sam who is sitting on the
couch scribbling her dashes on the toilet paper once again
Riggan takes out a plastic container of bologna and a jar of
mustard He sits in front of his dressing table peels open the
bologna and opens the jar of mustard Slice by slice he dips
the bologna in the mustard and shoves it into his mouth

SAM
Dad

102914 87

RIGGAN
(Looking up)
Hey How ya doin
SAM
Are you okay
RIGGAN
Why
SAM
I dont know You seem--
RIGGAN
(Eating )

Im good This is good
(Holding out a piece)
You want some

SAM

RIGGAN
Great Great

He continues to eat She tries to fill the odd silence

SAM
So Opening night tomorrow
RIGGAN
Yeah
SAM
Thats exciting huh
RIGGAN
Yeah Well I dont know The previews

have been a train wreck We havent been
able to get through a performance
without a raging fire or a raging
hard-on Im not really sleeping you
know at all And Im pretty much broke
Oh and also this play feels like a
miniature deformed version of myself
that keeps following me around hitting
me in the balls with a tiny hammer
(Beat )
Sorry what was your question

SAM
(Looking through phone)
Never mind Tonight wasnt bad It was
weird But thats sort of cool People
seemed to like it

102914

Silence Riggan notices the toilet paper

RIGGAN
What are you doing Some homework

SAM
No I dont-- When I was in rehab they
made us do this

RIGGAN
Really

SAM
Yeah These dashes represent the six
billion years the planet has existed
Each dash represents 100 years

She unravels the roll and we see that there are thousands
black marks running along the toilet paper She takes the
two panels and tears them off

SAM (CONTD)
And this (Hands them to him) is
supposed to represent the entire time us
humans have been here One hundred and
fifty thousand years Thats it

(Beat )
I guess they were trying to remind us
that thats what all our egos and self-
obsession are worth

Riggan stares at the paper and then at Sam

RIGGAN
(Casually )
I was a shitty father wasnt I
SAM
No You were a-- (She stops herself)

You were fine
He stops chewing and stares out
RIGGAN

Fine Youre right I am just
fine Adorably mediocre

of
last

He smiles to her sadly and then he wipes the mustard from his

face with the piece of toilet paper

SAM
Dad

RIGGAN
What

102914 89
Sam looks at the ruined toilet paper in his hands

RIGGAN (CONTD)
Oh Shit Im sorry

saM

(Smiling )
Its okay You just destroyed the entire
human race in one blow

Riggan looks at her with the saddest of expressions

SAM (CONTD)
Dad (She hesitates) Do you know
youre becoming a trending topic

RIGGAN
Really What does that mean

Sam searches for something on her iPhone and then hands it to
Riggan Riggan looks at the phone and sees a hand-held video of
himself in the streets in his underwear

SAM
350000 views in less than an hour
Believe it or not this is power

Riggan looks at more footage seemingly confused After a
moment the phone vibrates and the video is interrupted by a
text message which reads “Truth or Dare”

RIGGAN
Its for you

She grabs the phone and looks at the screen Then at her
father Riggan is staring at her She looks down

RIGGAN (CONT’D)
Go ahead

SAM
(Hesitant)
Are you

RIGGAN
Go

A sympathetic smile An understanding Sam exits
Riggan stares into the mirror absently His eyes locked on
his reflection trying to find himself in the image Then he

spots a vase with dying roses the same roses he flung to the
ground previously

102914 90

He gets up and goes into the bathroom He pulls off the long
wig and the mustache He washes his face Then he opens a
small bottle and uses the liguid to scrub his goatee The
dark dye begins to run out leaving only white hair For the
first time we see that Riggan has a white beard

He puts on new clothes and comes out of the bathroom He grabs
a beige raincoat and heads out of the dressing room and
into

INT HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 47

the hallway As he passes by Mike’s door he can hear Sam and
Mike Theyre trying to be as quiet as possible but we can hear
them flirting and laughing

He pauses for a moment but continues on After a few seconds
his phone vibrates He looks at it A text from Jake reads
“Have you seen this Awesome” He clicks the attachment and
sees the now infamous video of his underwear escapade in the
street We zoom in until the image fills the screen when we
finally pull away we discover that

INT RUM HOUSE - LATER 48

Riggans video is being played now in a television in the
bar We see the MTV logo on the bottom of the screen and a video
caption that reads “Birdman goes viral 930000 views and
counting” The camera pans to find Riggan sitting at the bar
drunk He is one of the few customers He polishes off his
drink

RIGGAN

Let me have another one
BARTENDER

You got it

The bartender pours another whiskey for Riggan A waiter steps
up to the bar The bartender points to a martini

BARTENDER (CONTD)
(To the waiter)
Thats going over to Ms Dickinson

Riggans head tilts at the mention of the name He looks over to
see Tabitha sitting at a table scratching in her notebook

RIGGAN

(Hands the waiter a bill)
I got it Shes a friend of mine

102914 91

The waiter pockets the money and gives Riggan the drink He
walks it over to Tabitha and places it down in front of her Not
looking up she pulls the drink closer and takes a sip

Riggan sits down across from her She looks up and immediately
recognizes him He takes out the Carver cocktail napkin and
pushes it in front of her She looks at him and then down to
the napkin She reads it in silence

RIGGAN (CONTD)
(Re The napkin )
That was twenty years before I put on that
damned costume

A pause Then she pushes the napkin back toward him

TABITHA
I dont care

RIGGAN
Im just saying when you come tomorrow
night I want you--

TABITHA
It doesn’t matter

RIGGAN
What are you--

TABITHA
Im going to destroy your play

RIGGAN
You havent even seen it I dont-- Did I
do something to offend you

TABITHA
As a matter of fact you did You took up
space in a theater which otherwise might
have been used on something worthwhile

RIGGAN
But you dont even know if its--

TABITHA
Thats true I havent read a word of it
or even seen a preview but after the
opening tomorrow Im going to turn in the
worst review anybody has ever read And Im
going to close your play Would you like to
know why Because I hate you And everyone

Tabitha goes back to her writing Riggan sits for a moment

RIGGAN
What has to happen in someones life
for them to end up becoming a critic

She looks up at him

RIGGAN (CONT’D)

Whatcha writin’ You reviewin’ a play Was
it good Bad Did you even see it Lemme

He snatches the notebook from her

TABITHA
I will call the police

RIGGAN
No you wont Let’s read your review

(He scans the notebook)
“Callow” A label “Lackluster” Label
“Marginalia” Sounds like you need
penicillin to clear that up None the
less label

(Looks to Tabitha)
All labels You’re a lazy fucker
arent you

(Looks one last time at

the notebook )
Epistemological vertigo

Tabitha wants to reach for the notebook but her pride wont
let her Riggan takes a flower from a vase at the center of the
table

RIGGAN (CONTD)

You know what this is You don’t do
you You can’t even see it if you don’t
label it You mistake those sounds in
your head for true knowledge

the notebook)
Well I’m an actor and this play has
cost me everything So you can take
your cowardly malicious shittily
written reviews and shove them up
your (Showing her the wrinkled
page) wrinkly tight ass

Riggan wears a proud smile And suddenly Tabitha begins to
smile with him

TABITHA
You think you’re an actor

(Calls to the waiter)

Eddie the waiter approaches the table

WAITER
Yeah Mrs Dickinson

TABITHA
Give us some Shakespeare

WAITER

Tabitha looks over at Riggan picking the perfect verse

TABITHA

Creeps in this petty pace from day to

A few drunks clap at the beautiful performance Then a powerful
silence rings out for a moment until

TABITHA
Thank you Eddie

WAITER
You got it

TABITHA

(To Riggan A derisive laugh)
Youre no actor Youre a celebrity
Lets be clear on that

Tabitha rises from her seat and grabs her things

TABITHA (CONT’D)
Im going to kill your play

She walks away Riggan sits numb After a moment he reaches
over and gulps down Tabithas entire martini gin pouring out
the sides of his mouth Unaware he slams the empty martini
glass on top of the Carver napkin and gets up We follow him
out onto

49 EXT STREET - CONTINUOUS 49

the street where he walks through the theater district
Tired Drunk Empty Neon lights all around him A crazy old
homeless man passes by in the opposite direction shouting
furiously Riggan keeps walking until he arrives at a bench
with a tree behind Everything is quiet Riggan sits on the
bench lost We begin to tilt up slowly toward a tall tree
We move closer into the branches and the green leaves
Silence

AAQ A4Q

Night turns into day The sounds of the city disappear and
birds begin to sing The branches now caressed by golden shafts
of morning sun Finally we tilt down slowly and find

50 EXT STREET - DAY 50

Riggan still sleeping on the bench He looks like a bum His
raincoat is dirty and wet

102914 95

BIRDMAN (VO)
God You look like shit brother You
get that mongoloid look when youre hung
over dont you

Riggan opens an eye He scratches his hair

BIRDMAN (V0)
Lets go Get up Its a beautiful day

Riggan sits up slowly He is really hung over

BIRDMAN (V0)
Stand up Forget about the times Everyone
else has So youre not a great actor
Who cares Youre much more than that
Fuck You tower over all these theater
douchebags Youre a movie star A Global
force Dont you get it

Riggan stands up and begins to stumble forward We pan around
to find Birdman (a stronger Riggan wearing a cool Birdman
outfit) following behind him

BIRDMAN
You spent your whole life building a
reputation and a bank account and now
theyre both blown So what Fuck it We
make a come back Something huge Take what
belongs to us Take back the spotlight
Magazine covers and billboards Happy meals
with Birdman dolls Remember that Thats
who you are That’s who we are

Riggan just marches on People and cars pass by but nobody
notices Birdman Riggan tries to ignore him

BIRDMAN (CONTD)
Cmon buddy Tell me were going back
to the big leagues Let’s do this
Shave off that pathetic goatee and put
the mask back on Batman my balls
Well start a new franchise Birdman
Phoenix Rising Trust me A billion
world wide Swear to God

AS0 A50

Riggan keeps walking Birdman insistent chases until
suddenly he begins to flutter off the ground

BIRDMAN
Do you hear me You can do anything You’re
an icon

B50

cso

102914 96
Desperate Birdman flies a bit higher around him

BIRDMAN (CONTD)
Youre bigger than life You save people
from their boring miserable lives

The camera pans to the street in front of them People carry
out their everyday routines There is a deli a souvenir shop
a small bank

BIRDMAN (0S) (CONTD)
You make them jump laugh cry
shit their pants All you have to do
is snap your fingers and

B50

Riggan snaps his fingers once twice and the bank suddenly
explodes The sound is so loud that it seems to belong to
another movie The earth shakes People run Dust all over
Fire An unsteady camera pans back to Birdman

BIRDMAN
(Excited )
Thats what Im talking about That is
cool Explosive Big fast loud
(He turns directly to the camera
and talks about the audience)
Look at them They love that shit
They starve for blood and action
not this artsy-fartsy-philosophical
bullshit

c50

We hear a loud roar and the camera pans to discover a huge
alien about to crash a cab against the asphalt Birdman uses his
powerful blow to send the alien flying away

BIRDMAN

And when you shout whooaa
(Riggan shouts Whooaa)

it explodes in the eardrum of

millions Your power is unlimited

Riggan slows down his pace as he starts to listen

BIRDMAN (CONTD)

You glimmered on 3000 screens over 5
continents in 47 countries at the
same time You are ubiquitous Youre
a God You can do it again You can
soar above all of them
D50

E50

102914 97
D50

Riggan suddenly begins to levitate

BIRDMAN
There you go you mother fucker See
Gravity doesnt even apply to you

The camera flies up with Riggan as he floats above the street
There is something magical in his ascension gently impelled by
the breeze A beautiful backlight makes his body glow Birdman
flutters around him

BIRDMAN (CONTD)
Listen to me We gotta go back We have to
do this We have to end it on our terms
With a grand gesture

A strange light suddenly palpitates in Riggans eyes Something
makes sense in what Birdman is telling him

The camera becomes Riggans POV He looks down to see the
people on the street watching him in awe

BIRDMAN (0S) (CONTD)
Well go back We’ll show them how much
theyre going to miss us Flames Icarus
Sacrifice

We tilt up again to Riggans face He has a plan

BIRDMAN (0S) (CONTD)
Lets go back one more time and show them
what we’re capable of You can do it
Youre Birdman Do you hear me Youre

A GUYS VOICE (0S)
Birdman

E50

And as the camera pulls away we discover Birdman is gone and
Riggan is standing on the ledge of a tall building The camera
tilts down and we see that more people have gathered around
and more cars has stopped and they all point at Riggan
worried about the situation

A guy wearing shorts a Bob Marley t-shirt and a robe opens his
window one floor below Riggan and looks up at him

GUY
Dude what are you doing

Riggan looks down at the people on the street far below

102914 98

GUY (CONTD)
You okay buddy Do you want me to
call someone

We pan to a lady on her balcony filming Riggan with her phone

LADY
Is this for real or youre shooting a
film

RIGGAN
A film

The lady looks around but sees nothing

LADY
Oh you people are full of shit

She goes into her apartment

GUY
Im calling 911

The guy goes inside his apartment

RIGGAN
One more time

Now from the door of the rooftop a good neighbor calmly
approaches Riggan

GOOD NEIGHBOR
Hi sir Can I help you You should be
careful

RIGGAN
Sorry Can’t talk Im late
(Murmuring )
Music

Some underscoring music begins to sound The neighbor is now
close to him and helps Riggan step down from the edge on to the
floor of the rooftop

GOOD NEIGHBOR
Are you alright Do you want me to
call someone Do you know where to go

Riggan closes his eyes for a moment as the camera moves slowly
toward him He opens his eyes The music begins to swell Riggan
stands up straight and proud and in a voice that sounds like
Birdman

RIGGAN
Yes I know where to go

F50

G50

AS1

102914 99

He turns and begins to run on the rooftop The music is rousing
As he runs he holds out his arms spreading them wide The
camera runs behind him until suddenly

F50
Riggan jumps and the camera jumps after him He rapidly

falls toward the street toward the asphalt But in his face
there is no fear No He spreads his arms again and

G50
He takes flight soaring high over Manhattan The music becomes
epic There is something beautiful about this broken man flying

like a superhero We fly next to him and we can see below the
spectacular sight that is Manhattan until

EXT THEATER - CONTINUOUS 51

-he finally lands on 45th street and calmly approaches the
theater An Usher acknowledges him with a look of surprise

USHER
Mr Thomson I think you forgot to--

RIGGAN
Stop the music

The music stops

USHER
I beg your pardon

Riggan enters the theater
The confused Usher watches him go by as he points to the
street We pan to see a taxi driver coming out of his car
running like a mad man toward us
We stay with the Usher and the taxi driver as they argue They
take it inside the lobby but we remain out front

A51
Day turns to night igniting the lights of the marquee which
reflect off of the lobby doors We hear wild applause coming

from inside the theater Seconds later the doors of the
theater open and the audience files out for intermission

102914 100

MAN
(Tweeting on his phone)
Its really good

WOMAN
I know I can’t believe it

We begin to move up outside the theater We see the marquee of
the play that reads What We Talk When We Talk About Love
Above the title in smaller print Riggan Thomson and Mike
Shiner Below on a banner Opening Night

We keep climbing until we arrive at Riggans dressing room
window We push in to find

INT RIGGANS DRESSING ROOM - THEATER - EVENING 52
that the room is full of roses and cards Riggan lies on
the sofa hugging a cushion He is wearing the long wig and
mustache for the motel scene

Sylvia appears in the doorway
SYLVIA
Wow that is just NASCAR hot
He smiles at her
SYLVIA (CONTD)
I just wanted to come say hello Its going
great out there Youre so good I mean it
Youre-- I really mean it
RIGGAN
Come here Sit next to me
ANNIE ON SPEAKERS
This is your five minutes
SYLVIA

RIGGAN

SYLVIA
Look at all these roses
SYLVIA (CONTD) RIGGAN
You hate roses I hate roses

She laughs He watches her something odd in his expression

102914 101

SYLVIA (CONTD)
Are you okay You seem-- I don’t know you
seem abnormally calm

RIGGAN
I am calm I’m great I spent most of
the day observing how beautifully this
pile of dirty clothes was lit by the
warm afternoon sun (A tiny smile) So
beautiful

Sylvia teasing him closes her eyes and imitates Riggans
meditation posture

SYLVIA
(Mocking him)
Oh yes God is those purplish light
dots I see between my eyes and my
eyelids

RIGGAN
You know I have this voice that talks to
me and tells me the truth It’s comforting
and scary

A beat
SYLVIA
I’m going to pretend I didn’t hear you say
that
RIGGAN
Okay
SYLVIA

(Changing the subject)
You wouldnt believe the crowd outside
They said some people paid up to 500
dollars a ticket

He sits down

RIGGAN

You wanna hear something funny
SYLVIA

Sure
RIGGAN

Do you remember our last anniversary party
SYLVIA

Seriously Youre going to ruin a nice
moment with that

102914 102

RIGGAN
Do you remember the party

SYLVIA
The party where you fucked Janet Rossbach
in our bed Yeah it rings a bell

RIGGAN
Yeah well Lets skip over that part
for a minute

SYLVIA
Gladly

RIGGAN
After you threw the guests out of the
house and the furniture out of the
window You locked yourself in the

bathroom

SYLVIA
I remember Why are we--

RIGGAN
I drove down to Malibu I sat on the beach
for a while Just staring out at the
ocean

SYLVIA
Riggan

RIGGAN

Until I walked straight into the water
and tried to drown myself

Silence Sylvia stares at Riggan surprised

RIGGAN (CONTD)

I was in up to my chest when I felt the
first one On my back like somebody was
holding a frying pan against me And then
my chest and my legs The water was full
of jellyfish I fought my way out of the
water and I started rolling around the
sand like a maniac crying

Sylvia doesnt know how to react

SYLVIA
You said it was a sunburn

RIGGAN

(Smiling )
And you believed me

102914 103

SYLVIA
To be honest I didnt give a shit

RIGGAN
I love you And I love Sam

SYLVIA
I know

Silence They stare at each other

RIGGAN
I never should have video taped Sams
birth First of all because you and Sam
both look like shit in that video But
mostly because I missed the moment I
should have just been there with the two
of you Present in my own life So Id
have it But I don’t I don’t have any of
it

SYLVIA
You have Sam

RIGGAN
No I dont

SYLVIA
Listen shes just——

RIGGAN
No I understand She needed a father
and she got one shamefully successful
youtube video Pretty pathetic

SYLVIA
(Putting a finger on
Riggan’s lips)
Shhh There are more pathetic things
than that That mustache for example

She kisses him

ANNIE ON SPEAKERS
Places for act two Places

SYLVIA
Riggan

RIGGAN
You should get back to your seat You
dont want to miss whats next

Sylvia lingers for a moment and not knowing what to say she
exits Riggan opens a drawer and takes out a black case He

102914 104

gently opens the lid Inside a revolver He takes some bullets
out of a box and one by one loads them into the chamber as he
does his vocal exercises into the mirror

RIGGAN (CONTD)

Twenty little leopards laughed at two

lofty lions Twenty little leopards

laughed at two lofty lions Twenty

little leopards laughed
He stares at the dressing room door and with his telekinetic
powers he opens it He snaps the cylinder into the gun and
exits out into
INT HALLWAY - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 53
the hallway He paces deliberately gun in hand

A technician goes by in the opposite direction

TECHNICIAN
Break a leg Mr Thomson

Riggan ignores him and continues through to the

INT BACKSTAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 54

backstage area Annie immediately hustles over to him holding

up the brain mechanism He walks right by her

RIGGAN
(Brushing her off)
I dont need it

Annie doesnt seem to understand She stays there holding the
device Riggan takes his place outside the motel door We pan
toward the audience The auditorium is full The audience in
complete silence

Riggan knocks firmly on the door Silence again Then

RIGGAN (CONT’D)
Terri Terri
(Beat )
I know youre in there

He barges through the door and onto
102914 105

55 INT STAGE - THEATER - CONTINUOUS 55

the stage The motel room as we saw it before Mike and
Lesley jump out of the bed

LESLEY
Ed What are you doing here

RIGGAN
(Almost whispering )

Why I need you to tell me why I lived for

you-- I worshipped you

MIKE
Listen Ed I know this is hard but--

Riggan raises one hand to silence Mike Mike looks at him
confused His eyes narrow on the gun There is no red plug

Dead silence An eerie electricity in the theater

RIGGAN
Whats wrong with me Why do I end
up having to beg people to love me

LESLEY
Ed Eddie Please Give me the gun

She begins to cry

LESLEY (CONTD)
Just look at me I was drowning I
was not capable of-- You deserve to
be loved You do

RIGGAN

I just wanted to be what you wanted
(Beat )

Now I spend every fucking minute

praying to be someone else Someone

Im not Anyone

MIKE
Put down the gun Ed She just doesnt love
you anymore

RIGGAN
(To Lesley)
You dont do you

LESLEY

(With sympathy )
No

102914 106

RIGGAN
And you never will

LESLEY
Im sorry

For the first time Riggan turns to face the audience He
smiles the most beautiful insane smile

RIGGAN
I dont exist Im not even here I dont
exist None of this matters

Then he raises a trembling arm and with his eyes full of
tears he aims the gun at Mike

RIGGAN (CONTD)
Pum

But he doesn’t shoot Then he turns and aims at Tabitha
Dickinson who is sitting on the second row

RIGGAN (CONTD)
Pum

Again no shot Slowly Riggan raises the gun toward his own
head suddenly a frightening explosion Blood sprays Riggan
falls We stay with the shell-shocked audience A moment of
tension of uncertainty until

MAN
Bravo

The audience one by one jump to their feet applauding
wildly The sole exception is Tabitha who remains seated a
dazed expression on her face We stay with the audience a few
seconds longer

FADE TO BLACK
The sounds slowly vanish After a moment of silence
BIRDMAN (VO)
You wont be hearing from him

anymore

MAN (V0)
Is he

BIRDMAN (V0)
Hes gone

INT WAITING ROOM - HOSPITAL - DAWN

One of the old Birdman films is playing on a small television
screen that hangs on a corner The scene ends and a Morning
Show host appears Behind him a picture of Riggan and a
caption that reads “Nation in shock” A shot of a candle
vigil in Central park

HOST
What do we talk about when we talk
about Riggan Thomson When we come
back more on the actor who two
nights ago shot himself during the
opening performance of his new
Broadway play

We pan away from the TV to see that the waiting room is
filled with newsmen waiting for something to happen There is
almost no room to breath

We pan to see Jake emerging from an elevator carrying a
newspaper under his arm He walks through the dense mass of
newsmen with a serious expression on his face We follow him
into

INT ROOM - HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

-a room Jake peers in Riggan lies on a bed the bandages
on his nose cover most of his face Sylvia is looking out the
window

JAKE
Is he

SYLVIA
He’s awake

Jake enters the room

JAKE
(Serious )
I thought I lost you buddy Thank
god youre a horrible shot what
the hell happened I was watching
you up on that stage and all of a
sudden you get that goofy look in
your eye and you were just like--

He starts to laugh

SYLVIA
What the hell are you laughing
about He tried to-- What is wrong
with you

102914 108

JAKE
Im happy okay He’s alive My
best friend is alive And he is the
man of the hour

Jake holds the New York Times up in the air

RIGGAN
What is that
JAKE
You did it
SYLVIA
(Coming to them)
You have to be shitting me She

wrote a review

Jake unfolds the newspaper and we see the headline of the
review “The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance”

JAKE
(To Sylvia)
Read it

He hands her the newspaper She begins to read to herself

SYLVIA
I don’t believe this

JAKE
Read it out loud

SAM

Thompson has unwittingly given
birth to a new form that can only
be described as supra-realism
Blood was spilled both literally
and metaphorically by artist and
audience alike Red blood The
blood that has been sorely missing
from the veins of the American
theatre

(Beat To a smiling Jake)
Youre happy about this

She hands it to Riggan

JAKE
Happy Im fucking euphoric This
is the-- This is the kind of review
that turns someone into a living
legend

102914 109

SYLVIA
He tried to-- He shot the nose off
his face

JAKE

Hes got a new nose And if he
doesn’t like that one well get
him another one We can use Meg
Ryans guy Who gives a shit Turn
on the tv There are people praying
for him all over the country
Theyre lighting candles in Central
Park He did it (To Riggan) You
did it The play’s gonna run
forever It’s gonna open in London
in Paris The studios will call
us again We’ll get book offers

SYLVIA
How do you know all that You can
see the future

JAKE
(Euphoric )
Yes

She slaps him in the face

SYLVIA
Did you see that coming You’re so
full of shit Jake

Jake needs a few seconds to recover Then he looks at Riggan
who just sits there in silence

JAKE
Why aren’t you saying anything
This is what you wanted wasn’t it
(Riggan gazes at the
review)
Riggan this is what you wanted

RIGGAN
It’s what I wanted

JAKE
Okay listen You’re gonna get hit
with a “brandishing a weapon”
charge If anybody talks to you it
was an accident and were doing an
internal invest--

A newsman comes into the room and takes a quick picture

102914 110

JAKE (CONT’D)
(Chasing him out)
This is a hospital you motherfucker

Jake rushes to the door shoving the newsman and a few other
paparazzi out the door Security guards Chaos Finally
silence Sylvia steps up and looks Riggan in the eye

SYLVIA
Is that what it was An accident

Riggan just stares at her His calm sad eyes peeking through
the bandages After a moment his gaze moves over her
shoulder Sylvia turns and we discover Sam standing in the
doorway holding a bouquet of flowers A bit of awkward
silence and Sylvia decides to leave them alone

She kisses Sam on the head and exits Sam walks the flowers
to Riggan at the bed She lays them on his chest

SAM
Alchemillas

The hint of a smile on Riggan’s face

SAM (CONTD)

Are you actually smiling
(She smiles)

What’s so funny

RIGGAN
I can’t smell them

A moment until the smiles turn to gentle laughter She takes
out her cell phone and snaps a picture of him

RIGGAN (CONTD)
What are you doing

SAM
I’m posting this picture on your
Twitter page

RIGGAN
Very funny

SAM
Set it up today

RIGGAN
Youre joking

SAM

102914 111

RIGGAN
Let me see the picture

SAM
Absolutely not You look hideous

RIGGAN
Thanks a lot

saM
I’m just kidding No I’m not You
look hideous

(Working on phone )
You already have 80 thousand
followers In less than a day And
I’m about to scare the shit out of
them

RIGGAN
Let me see

SAM
No Done

A moment between them Sam picks up the flowers and kisses
him tenderly on the head Riggan is pleasantly surprised by
that kiss

SAM (CONTD)
Now I’m going to find something to
put these flowers in

She heads out of the room Riggan lies there for a moment
tranquil After a moment he reaches up and touches his
bandages Finally he climbs out of the bed We follow him
into

INT BATHROOM - ROOM - HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

the bathroom He stands before the mirror He stares at
his reflection for a few seconds and slowly begins to remove
the bandages We can see that Riggan’s nose has been
reconstructed It is a crooked incomplete nose like the one
Javier Bardem has

RIGGAN
I do look hideous

In the reflection Riggan sees Birdman sitting on the toilet
They look at each other but say nothing Riggan puts the
bandages back on and we follow him out to
102914 112

INT ROOM - HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

the room He looks around but Sam is gone He ambles over
to the window his ass hanging out of the back of his
hospital robe He opens the window and feels the sun and the
breeze on his swollen face We just hear the sounds of the
people standing down in the parking lot Media trucks Fans
We stay with Riggan who seems to be thinking about
something He sees a flock of birds dancing in the sky Then
he grabs the side of the window with one hand and begins to
step up onto the sill

The camera pans away from him to a table that has some photos
propped on it One of he and Sam when she was a child One
with Sylvia and Sam A copy of Carvers “What we talk About
When We Talk About Love” laying on the surface

The camera continues to pan until it comes to the door Sam
enters with a small vase She looks around

saM
Dad
She goes to the bathroom and peers in nothing
SAM (CONTD)
Dad

She spots the opened window and registers the sounds from
outside Tentatively she walks toward the window She gets
there summons her courage and looks down Nothing Slowly
confused she tilts her head up and looks up into the sky A
smile filled with pride begin to wash over her face
