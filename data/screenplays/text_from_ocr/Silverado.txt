PRODUCTION DRAFT

FADE IN
INT SHACK - DAY

Darkness Quiet The CAMERA MOVES through the gloom of the
small dirty wooden hut past a broken table over a well-
worn saddle lying on the floor Now a pair of boots standing
empty by the rotting remains of a rough-hewn bunk up to a
holstered gun hung on the corner of the bed The still shape
of a man a bedroll his only protection from the splintery
planks This is EMMETT fast asleep

The door of the shack bursts inward as a Gunman crashes in
For a moment he is silhouetted against the blinding morning
light his two six-guns blasting even before the door has
bounced shut behind him returning the hut to darkness

Emmetts holster the gun gone

The gun is here in Emmetts hand erupting now with three
quick explosions The intruder flies against the far wall of
the hut and lands on the floor dead From outside two bullets
pierce the plank wall behind Emmett light streaming through
in 45 calibre shafts

Emmett is out of the bunk and on the floor He fires once
over the bunk In the moment of quiet that follows we hear
running FOOTSTEPS outside the hut Emmett follows their
progress with the point of his gun but holds his fire
Suddenly a shotgun blasts a large hole in the roof of the
shack and the table disintegrates in a new column of light

Emmett glances upward but quickly returns his attention to
the side walls trying to follow that gunman Now more fire
comes from there and more footsteps Another shotgun blast
s
Â°

owers Emmett with debris but he ignores it concentrating
n the walls

WHAT HE SEES The Man Outside moves quickly past a crack in
the wall momentarily revealing his spot by blocking the
light Emmett fires once ahead of him stopping his progress
and forcing him back to the crack Emmett fires his last
shot there and the man outside goes down hard

The shotgun rips another jagged hole in the ceiling and blows
a crater in the dirt by Emmetts foot The shape of a man
flashes across the new hole Emmett looks across the room at
the top bunk where the barrel of his Winchester protrudes a
few inches from the bare planks Emmett throws his empty six-
gun noisily into the far corner of the hut Instantly the
man on the roof blasts away in that direction

Emmett dives for the bunk With the tips of his fingers he
pulls hard on the muzzle The Winchester flips full circle
into the air as the bunk behind it is shredded from above

With an odd kind of inevitability as though seeking its
rightful place the Winchester arcs into a shaft of light
where it is met by Emmetts steady waiting hands Before it
has even settled he has cocked and fired twice through a
hole in the roof Emmett stops and lowers the carbine The
Man on the Roof falls spread-eagled through the weakened
ceiling Debris and sunlight shower his lifeless form

Emmett listens moves silently to the door and opens it
carefully WE FOLLOW him outside out into the bright
sunlight into the awesome promise of the American West

EXT SHACK - DAY

Emmett moves warily around the isolated shack There are no
more attackers He looks off into the distance Two riderless
horses galloping away are the only moving things in the
empty landscape A third saddled horse a pinto stands
nervously near Emmetts horse which is tied to a stake

Emmett walks to the body of the Man Outside and looks down
at him He doesnt know him He moves to the pinto and calms
it He examines the distinctive brand on its flank a circle
with two wavy lines beneath it Emmett is clearly mystified
He rests his arms on the saddle and stares after the
retreating horses

THE MAIN TITLE BEGINS
EXT EMMETT RIDES (VARIOUS SHOTS) - DAYNIGHT

Emmett travels the saddled pinto in tow He moves from high
mountain terrain down-country through meadow and canyon He
makes night camp near a rushing stream The land flattens as
he approaches the desert The sun beats at him as he dismounts
at the edge of a white-hot plain He takes a short pull from
his canteen and squints off across the flat empty space

All he can see ahead is blinding sand and blue sky

THE MAIN TITLE ENDS
EXT DESERT (SERIES OF SHOTS) - DAY

Emmett is now surrounded by the white blankness moving slowly
under the broiling sun

He stops his walking horses and squints out into the distance
seeing something We see it too but just barely a distant
horizontal smudge on the glaring sand

Emmett reaches the smudge It is a man barefoot and dressed
only in longjohns his head propped on a rock eyes closed
The mans skin is burned red and beginning to blister his
lips parched Yet there is a curious ease to his repose If
he has lain down here to die he has done it in peace This
is PADEN

Emmett lifts Padens head and puts the canteen to his lips
Padens eyes struggle to open in the glare He takes a few
sips of the water His lips crack with a slight smile at the
taste He looks up at Emmett takes another sip and tries
to speak Emmett must lean down to hear his raspy whisper as
he tries again

PADEN
Pleased to meet you

EXT NIGHT CAMP - DESERT - NIGHT

The terrain here is more hospitable Paden wrapped snugly
in a blanket lies with his head against the saddle from the
pinto Emmett is preparing his bedroll across the fire

EMMETT
Two of the horses ran off but that
pinto youre riding hung around

PADEN
You got no idea what they were after

Emmett shakes his head no

PADEN
Offend anybody lately

EMMETT
Not for five years

Paden understands

PADEN

EMMETT

PADEN

EMMETT

PADEN
(smiles)
Me Im riding along minding my own
business Four cowboys come by and
we decide to ride together for a
while friendly as can be I always
figure you might as well approach
life like everybodys your friend or
nobody is dont make much
difference We get out in the middle
of that frying pan and suddenly
everybodys pointing their gun but
me I guess they admired my horse
Shes a great one a sweet little

bay

EMMETT
Looks like thats not all they
admired

PADEN

Yup The whole rig I dont care
much about the rest but I surely
will miss that bay Least they didnt
kill me That was right considerate
I thought They were laughing when
they left me Thought it was real
funny I walked for a little while
but there was no use so I gave it
up Figured it was just bad luck

Emmett comes over and fills Padens coffee cup

EMMETT
Looks like those boys are headed
south so they werent the same ones
that jumped me Which way you going

PADEN
Wheres the pinto going

EMMETT
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a
guy

PADEN

Wheres Turley

EMMETT
South of here past Chimayo

PADEN
Maybe Ill go along as far as Chimayo
Get me some clothes Maybe a bath

EMMETT
Yeah maybe a bath

Emmett settles down at his saddle and pulls a blanket over
himself Paden glances at the rifle in its scabbard on the
pintos saddle by his head

PADEN
Is this loaded

Emmett nods and closes his eyes Paden smiles at the implied
trust and settles down himself

EXT APPROACHING CHIMAYO - DAY

Emmett and Paden who is still clad only in longjohns ride
toward the low adobe settlement of Chimayo

EXT ENTERING CHIMAYO - DAY

Emmett and Paden enter the town past a cluster of teepees
Three Cavalry troopers ride past them

EXT STREET - CHIMAYO - DAY

The little settlement is the center of civilization for miles
around The U S Cavalry maintains an outpost here and
there are many soldiers on the street Emmett and Paden pull
up to the general store Paden dismounts and hands his reins
to Emmett Passersby look with curiosity at the undressed
Paden

EMMETT
Ill get these horses tended

Paden nods and looks doubtfully at the store He scratches
himself Emmett produces some money and flips Paden a coin
Paden nods

PADEN
Im good for it

Emmett rides up the street leading the pinto Paden starts
toward the store and nearly collides with a shocked woman

who covers the eyes of the little girl with her and crosses
the street Paden gives an apologetic tip to his non-existent
hat as he watches them go Before he can turn back to the
store his eye is caught by something up the street He reacts
big

WHAT HE SEES His horse a good-looking bay And dawdling
his way out of a saloon a disreputable-looking Cowboy

Padens hand slaps his side where his gun should be He
grimaces and looks around desperately then hurries into the
store

INT STORE - DAY

The lone CLERK is showing a woman customer a bolt of cloth
at the back of the store Paden hurries in and makes a bee-
line to the display case holding handguns and ammo He spots
something he likes and taps the glass impatiently The Clerk
reacts with distaste to Padens appearance

PADEN
Excuse me there --

CLERK
Ill be with you in a moment sir

Paden looks out the front window up the street The Cowboy
is untying the bays reins

Paden more agitated now glances back at the Clerk then
moves around and opens the back of the display case He

extracts a shiny new Colt 45 The Clerk reacts with alarm
and moves toward Paden

CLERK
Just a minute there fella When Im
done with this lady --

PADEN
Ill take this one

He drops his coin on the case top
CLERK
(looking at coin)
That ones twenty dollars

Paden is frustrated He leans to peer out the window again

PADEN
How much to borrow it

CLERK
These guns are for sale

PADEN
(indicates his coin)

What can I get for that

The Clerk gives up on putting him off and comes around the
display case disgruntled

EXT IN FRONT OF SALOON - DAY
The Cowboy mounts the bay
INT STORE - DAY

Paden holds a broken-down memory of a gun as though it were
a cow chip

PADEN
(resigned)
Whats it take
The Clerk holds up a box of shells

CLERK
This is extra

Paden snatches it from his grasp and heads out of the store

PADEN
Ill be back

EXT STREET - DAY

Paden hurries out into the middle of the street Several
passersby stop to look at him A teenage girl lets out a
delighted shriek

IN FRONT OF THE SALOON The Cowboy has turned the bay into
the middle of the street and now looks to see what all the
fuss is about When he makes out Paden standing alone his
expression changes

Paden is having trouble extracting a shell from the ammo
box He glances up the street at the Cowboy and sees that he
has been spotted He shakes one shell loose and drops the
box trying to insert the bullet in the gun

The Cowboy pulls his six-gun leans forward and spurs the
bay hard toward Paden He raises his gun and fires at Paden
There is general alarm in the street as the bystanders dive
for cover

Paden gets the shell loaded as the Cowboy bears down on him
firing The bullets kick up the dust in front and back of
Paden who now raises his pistol slowly A bullet tears
through the floppy material at his crotch The Cowboy is
almost upon him when Paden fires The Cowboy is knocked off
the horse and hits the street dead

OMIT
EXT STREET - DAY

A big tough Cavalry SERGEANT has been summoned by a TROOPER
and now walks briskly toward --

A small crowd gathered around Paden who is affectionately
stroking his reacquired horse Two troopers flank him
suspiciously The Sergeant glances at the body of the Cowboy
then pushes through the crowd and confronts Paden

TROOPER
(indicating Paden)
This is the man Sergeant He claims
the animal was stolen
SERGEANT
How do I know this is your horse

The bay nuzzles Paden

PADEN
Cant you see this horse loves me

SERGEANT
Oh yeah and what would your name

SHERIFF COBB (0OS)
Paden

The Sergeant and Paden both look to see COBB come through

the crowd he is an imposing man in a duster Padens reaction
is deep and mixed a whole chapter in his life coming back

at him

PADEN
(quietly)
Hello Cobb

SHERIFF COBB
Hello Paden How ya doing

SERGEANT

SHERIFF COBB

One of the troopers uncinches the saddle and flops it upside-
down in the dust Paden is scratched on the underside

SERGEANT

The crowd begins to break up Paden and Cobb are left facing
one another Cobb takes in Padens longjohns
SHERIFF COBB

PADEN

SHERIFF COBB
Wheres the dog

Padens look pierces Cobb but he bends to pick up his saddle
and when he straightens there is a smile on his face

OMIT
EXT SIDEWALK - DAY

Cobb and Paden come out of the general store and start down
the sidewalk Paden is a little unsteady in a pair of cheap
boots A small pile of clothing is in his arms On his head
is a bad-looking new hat He catches his reflection ina
window and tries to give the hat a rakish tilt

PADEN

horses at the gate of the stoc

The heavy gate is opened and a
sunlight he looks back into t

PADEN
(to himself)

EXT RESTAURANTSIDEWALK - DAY

Emmett and Paden come out of a restaurant Paden is now bathed
and fully dressed for the first time and he looks quite
different better The old gun he purchased is stuck in his
belt Three horses -- Emmetts the pinto Padens bay --

are tied to the post in the street

Paden is fussing with his new cheap hat Emmett takes a
close look at Padens bay

EMMETT
I see what you like shes mighty
pretty

PADEN

And bridle-wise too Shes the only
thing I lost I really cared about

(he messes with his

hat disgruntled)
Cept for maybe my hat Its a great
one Got a pretty silver band on it

(frowns at his new

hat)
I surely do miss that hat

Emmett gives him an amused look this sounds kind of familiar
Emmett unties his two horses

EMMETT
I gotta be going

PADEN
Going to Turley was it

EMMETT
(nods)
Gotta meet a guy and head out for
Silverado

Paden takes the excess reins of the bay and begins idly
slapping them around the post distracted Emmett swings up
to his horse

PADEN
Whats Turley like
EMMETT
(he doesnt make
distinctions)
Its a town

PADEN
They got a saloon there

EMMETT

Paden takes a long time looking around the villages main
street It doesnt look promising Emmett regards him with
growing bemusement Finally --

EMMETT
Maybe you want to ride along with me
as far as Turley

Paden lights up slightly at the suggestion He looks up at
Emmett This is how Paden makes his decisions these days He
seems to be digesting it slowly

PADEN
Maybe Ill ride along as far
as Turley

Emmett nods and turns his horses into the street Paden mounts
up and follows him

EXT TRIP TO TURLEY (SERIES OF SHOTS) - DAY

The two men leading the pinto make their way through desert
country to Turley

EXT EDGE OF TURLEY - DAY

Near the corrals at the end of the main street of the small
town of Turley a small WAGON TRAIN is loosely formed up
waiting The settlers from the wagon train mill about Several
regard Emmett and Paden with unusual interest as they ride

by on their way into town

One of the Settlers is a lovely young woman She glances at
the two men then returns her attention to her wagon Both
Emmett and Paden notice her She is HANNAH

EXT MAIN STREET - TURLEY - DAY

A tall gallows is being constructed in the middle of an
intersection Emmett and Paden look it over as they ride
past Two workmen pause in their labors and look them over

EXT SALOONHOTEL - TURLEY - DAY

This is the busy part of town Amidst the street traffic and
pedestrians sits a wagon with three Settler men who watch
Emmett and Padens arrival with enormous interest As the
two travelers hitch their horses in front of the saloon the
oldest man HOBART approaches them with some agitation

HOBART
(yelling)
Baxter Hawley where the hell have
you been Youre late And Ill tell
you I dont like it Its a bad
start boys

Emmett and Paden exchange looks

HOBART
Ive got my people sitting down
there
(indicates end of
street)
Swatting flies and raring to go

EMMETT
Im afraid it is a bad start friend
Cause my name isnt Baxter and he
aint Hawley

HOBART
Youre not Baxter

EMMETT
My name is Emmett

HOBART
(to Paden)
And youre not Baxter either

PADEN
No Im not Hawley

HOBART
Well god-dammit God-dammit

Hobart turns and looks across to the other Settler men He
yells

HOBART
They aint Baxter and Hawley Where
the hell are Baxter and Hawley

All this commotion has attracted some attention and amusement
from passersby
BAXTER (0S)
Quit your yelling old man Were
right here

Hobart looks around to find two tough-looking men on horse-
back behind him -- BAXTER and HAWLEY

HOBART
Who you calling an old man

Baxter gets down from his horse and smiles friendly for
him

Emmett and Paden watch with interest

BAXTER
(offers his hand)
Calm down Mr Hobart Im Nord
Baxter That there is my partner
Tom Hawley

Hobart takes his hand grudgingly Hes glad they showed up

HOBART
(gruff)
Youre late Its a bad start boys

BAXTER
(grinning)
Yes sir Well just have to get you
people to Silverado that much quicker

Emmett and Paden have continued to watch Now Hawley looks
over at them suspiciously

HOBART
All right Lets get going

BAXTER
You remember my letter dont you
Mr Hobart Half now and half when
we get there

HOBART
(remembering impatient)
I remember I remember Cmere

Hobart Baxter and Hawley move to the wagon where the two
other Settlers wait The younger of the two CONRAD eyes
the guides suspiciously Hobart speaks to the third man a
huge bearded fellow called EB Eb sits upon a strongbox in
the bed of the wagon an awesome blunderbuss in his arms

HOBART
Open the box Eb
Eb stands unlatches the strongbox and opens it revealing
an impressive cache of coins and paper money Hobart extracts
a pouch of coins and hands it to Baxter who pockets it

CONRAD
Dont you want to count it

BAXTER
Not at all friend We trust you
Now lets get this train on its way
to Silverado

Emmett and Paden watch the other five men head in the
direction of the wagon train Paden looks over at Emmett

INT SALOONHOTEL - DAY

At the back of the big room is a registration desk for the
hotel and stairs to the rooms Emmett and Paden are eating
near a table of three Tough Men Emmett is questioning a
WAITRESS and his questions are making her nervous

EMMETT
-Hes about my size energetic
young fella wears two guns ina
fancy rig Hed be a stranger here

WAITRESS
(moving away quickly)
I dont know him I told you I aint
seen nobody

Paden munching on a biscuit has noticed something out in
the street he gets up and walks to the entrance

EXT SALOONHOTEL - DAY

WHAT PADEN SEES The wagon train is moving by Padens
attention is drawn to the seat of one of the wagons Hannah
the lovely settler woman is there sitting beside her in a
husbandly manner is Conrad Paden is interested enough in
the pretty girl that he barely registers a new arrival at
the saloons hitching post The newcomer takes his saddle-
bags and a Henry 44 rifle from his horse and comes up into
the saloon

INT SALOONHOTEL - DAY

The newcomer is a lithe strong black man -- MAL He has no
other weapon besides the rifle Mal looks around the room
and walks wearily to the registration desk although there
is no one behind it He RINGS a bell for service

At the sound of the bell several of the patrons look up and
spot Mal for the first time The three Tough Men are instantly
displeased at the sight of the black man Paden returning

to his meal notes their attitude and glances over at Mal
Mal leaves his saddlebags at the registration desk but takes
the rifle as he walks across to the bar The nervous Waitress
is working there The sight of Mal only adds to her agitation

WAITRESS
(cold)
What do you want

MAL
(friendly tired)
I havent had a drink of whiskey or
slept in a bed for ten days Give me
a bottle

The Waitress hesitates uncertain She places a shot glass
and a bottle on the bar beyond an elaborate brass nude
statuette whose upraised arms hold dishes full of hard-boiled
eggs Mal has leaned his rifle against the bar and must now
move a few steps to stand before the whiskey

The three Tough Men exchange looks as Mal uncorks the bottle
and slowly lovingly fills his shot glass He puts the bottle
down and regards the glass for a long moment of pleasant
anticipation Mals hand has started for the glass when the
saloons PROPRIETOR appears from a back room

PROPRIETOR
(sharply)
Hey What are you doing buck

Mal draws his hand back and straightens slightly A different
kind of weariness comes into his face

MAL
Having a drink

PROPRIETOR
No youre not Get out of here

The Proprietor shoots the Waitress a withering look she
shrugs helplessly and hurries away At the tables two of the
three Tough Men quietly rise and separate moving toward the
two ends of the bar Emmett and Paden watch

MAL
(flat)
I havent had a drink of whiskey or
slept in a bed for ten days

PROPRIETOR
You aint getting them here

MAL
(gravely)
Im real sorry to hear that
At this the First Man steps forward quickly snatches Mals
rifle and slides it down the bar Mal looks across the
distance at his only weapon

PADEN
(quietly to Emmett)
Doesnt look quite fair

EMMETT
(watching carefully)
Which way do you mean

The Second Man lurches up to the bar and pins Mals arms
behind him The First Man moves quickly cocking back his
arm for a punch square in Mals face As the blow is
unleashed Mal bends forward with terrific speed and force
pulling the Second Man onto his back The Second Mans face
is suddenly where Mals was an instant ago and the First
Mans punch lands hard on it Mal slams the Second Mans

back against the edge of the bar he falls to the floor Mal
blocks a blow from the First Man and steps in with a flurry
of body blows

Back at the Tough Mens table the Third Man pushes back his
chair as if to rise Emmett has just picked up a chicken

leg now he waves it ever so slightly at the Third Man Stay
out of it The Man looks at Emmett and Paden then settles
back into his seat

Mal sends the First Man crashing down through a table with a
final blow He turns in time to see the Second Man back on
his feet grab Mals whiskey bottle and break it against the
bar Mal looks for a frustrated moment at the splashing

iskey -- what a waste The Second Man lunges with the sharp
lass Mal lifts the heavy statuette easily with one hand

nd uses its upraised arms to catch the Mans wrist and twist
e bottle painfully from his grasp Mals other hand hits

e Man once in the throat and he is down

trtweQge

e Proprietor rises from behind the bar a sawed-off shotgun
n his hand Mal spins swinging the statuette brutally
gainst the Proprietors arm The shotgun clatters to the
loor as the Proprietor recoils in pain crashing into a

elf of glasses The fight is over

Ono eH

Suddenly standing in the doorway holding a leveled gun is

an enormously tall figure -- SHERIFF LANGSTON Dressed rather
elegantly in suit and bowler he dwarfs the man at his side
DEPUTY KERN He surveys the scene as the three injured men
stir back to life When he speaks it is surprisingly with
a British accent --

LANGSTON
Whats all this then

PROPRIETOR
This niggers breaking up my place
Sheriff Langston

LANGSTON
I dont like that word much Carter

PROPRIETOR
We dont serve them here and you
know it I asked him to leave and he
went crazy on us He owes me money
for this damage

LANGSTON
Is that a fact

EMMETT
Fraid not Sheriff These other
fellas started the ruckus

Langstons attention focuses on Emmett and Paden

LANGSTON
There are three strangers in this
room traveller and these gents you
are accusing arent them
(to Mal indicating
Emmett and Paden)
Are these your friends

MAL
(shakes his head no
I wanted a drink and a bed I guess
I came to the wrong place

LANGSTON

(taking in the mess)
Came to the wrong town I dont
tolerate this kind of thing Its
hard on the peace and its hard on
the furniture Now knowing a bit
about Carter here Im going to let
you go without paying for the damages
But go you will and I mean now

MAL
Is there a place in town that takes
my kind

LANGSTON

You misunderstand I want you out of
town In fact I want you all the
way out of my jurisdiction

MAL
(seething)
That aint right

LANGSTON
I decide whats right in this
jurisdiction Now move

Mal glares at Langston and finally moves He takes his
rifle from the bar then walks over picks up his saddlebags
and slings them over his shoulder He is almost to the door
when he stops turns and walks slowly back to the bar The
shot glass full of whiskey has miraculously survived the
fracas Mal brings it to his lips and swallows with
satisfaction He turns and goes out the front door Langston
motions to Deputy Kern to follow and witness Mals departure

Langston turns and looks at Emmett and Paden as he slowly
uncocks his revolver and holsters it

PROPRIETOR
Whos going to pay for all this
Sheriff

LANGSTON

Dont press your luck Carter

Langston moves to Emmett and Padens table and pulls up a
chair He lifts the last biscuit from a basket He takes a
fastidious bite

LANGSTON
Now lets talk about you chaps

PADEN
Wed rather stay

LANGSTON
Well see about that Im Sheriff
John Langston As you may have
guessed I am not from these parts

PADEN
Youre kidding

LANGSTON

(ignoring that)
But the good citizens of Turley have
taken me in their embrace and for
one simple reason I maintain the
peace So when strangers come to
town I always ask them their
business Have you come for the
hanging

EMMETT
(no)
Im just meeting a guy here and moving
on So far I havent been able to
find him

LANGSTON
In my town when youre looking for
someone you ask me

EMMETT
All right Im looking for a young
fella full of juice About my size
wears a fancy two-gun rig

Langston takes a long time reacting to this information Now
he slides his chair back a foot giving his gun hand a little
more room

LANGSTON
I know where that gentleman is

OMIT
INT CELLBLOCK - EVENING

A lean young man is bouncing around his cell playing hacky
sack keeping a small leather bean bag from falling to the
floor by kicking it with his bare feet This is JAKE

Langston opens the door to the cellblock and speaks over his
shoulder to Emmett and Paden who have removed their guns

LANGSTON
Now I want everyone to behave himself

At the sight of Emmett Jakes face lights up And then he
does an extraordinary thing with one long stride he is across
the cell and into the air he hits the bars halfway up and
clings like a monkey Paden reacts as if he is one

JAKE
Emmett Am I glad to see you

EMMETT
(touching him)
Howdy Jake Whats going on here

JAKE
You got me This is a crazy town
Emmett I think we ought to get out
of here

Jake lowers himself and darts about as he talks

JAKE
All I did was kiss a girl

EMMETT
(skeptical)
Thats why they got you in jail

JAKE
Yeah I kissed a girl and this guy
didnt like it and we had some words
so I decided to get out of there

Jake looks at Emmett as though that should make it perfectly
clear Emmett waits

JAKE
So I did I got out of there I dont
want no trouble You know me
(indeed Emmett does)
So I walked out on the street and
the fella tried to shoot me in the
back

EMMETT
-And you had to kill him

JAKE
No no no I winged him and he
dropped his gun

EMMETT
Youre in here for winging a guy

Paden watches fascinated

JAKE
Well no not exactly See then his
friend opened up on me

EMMETT
What friend is that

JAKE
The one with the shotgun

LANGSTON
The dead one

There is a long moment of silence in the cellblock

EMMETT
Jake Im going to ask you once --
was it self-defense

JAKE
(after a moment
quieter now)
Honest to God Emmett he wouldve
killed me

LANGSTON
The jury saw it differently

PADEN
(putting it all
together)
So this is the guy youre going to
hang

LANGSTON
Tomorrow morning Ten oclock

PADEN
(nods)
I was afraid of that

Emmett steps back and leans against the opposite wall looking
down at his boots

JAKE
Emmett cant you help me

Emmett looks up at the young man He looks sad

EMMETT
Jake you know the law You know
what they did to me

Jake remembers It makes him gloomy

EMMETT
Blind Pete always said youd hang

Jakes eyes flick over Emmett but his expression doesnt
change

EMMETT
I guess tomorrow at dawn hell be
proved right

LANGSTON
Ten AM

EMMETT
Right I thought they always did
it at dawn
(to Jake)
So long kid Im sorry

Emmett walks out Jake watches as the other two follow
EXT STREET - NIGHT

Emmett and Paden walk along the sparsely populated sidewalk
They are quiet for a few moments Finally --

PADEN
Shame about the kid Seems a lively
sort
EMMETT
(morosely)

He is that
PADEN
I hate to see any man swing Bad
luck

EMMETT
Bad luck for me Now I gotta bust
him out of there

Paden stops Emmett has moved a couple more steps before he
notices and turns back to Paden

PADEN
Youll have to deal me out on that
Ive had some experience with that
sort of thing and I dont want any
more

EMMETT
I understand

PADEN
Its not going to be easy

EMMETT

It never is But hes my brother

(Paden reacts)
Were going to California together
But first were going to stop in
Silverado and see our sister And I
cant show up there with a story
like this

Paden nods He is sympathetic
PADEN
Then I guess this is where we part

ways Sorry

EMMETT
No hard feelings

PADEN
Cmon Ill buy you a drink

EMMETT
You havent got any money

PADEN
All right you buy me a drink

They cross the street toward the crowded noisy saloon
PADEN

You know a good smelly saloon is my
favorite place in the world
INT SALOONHOTEL - NIGHT

This is the busiest place in town really packed Emmett
heads for a spot at the bar but Paden who is taking in the
scene with relish stops in his tracks staring across the
room

WHAT HE SEES Through the moving jumble of bodies and the
heavy smoke Padens hat with its silver band floating atop
an unseen head at a poker table

Paden adjusts the old gun stuck in his belt and goes in that
direction

At the table a heavy game is in progress An UGLY COWBOY is
wearing Padens hat Paden plants himself across the table
from the man In seconds Padens posture brings things to a
halt Quiet ripples out across the room The Ugly Cowboy
looks up and recognizes Paden

PADEN
Youre wearing my hat What else you
got thats mine

UGLY COWBOY
I dont know what youre talking
about mister

He shifts a little in his chair His right hand slides off
the table Bystanders back away Emmett watches from the
bar

PADEN
I hope your hand isnt tickling my
bone-handled Colt If you stand up
real slow and let me see you might
live through this night

The Ugly Cowboy hesitates his eyes darting He pushes his
chair back slowly and begins to rise as if in compliance
But now a bone-handled Colt is in his hand clearing his
holster Paden is quicker He snatches his gun from his belt
and fires

Padens eyes squinting through a cloud of gunsmoke as we
hear the Ugly Cowboys body CRASH to the floor in his chair
Padens glance now darts down at an angle

WHAT HE SEES His hat lands on the saloon floor spins once
on its brim and settles into stillness like a tossed coin

Silence in the saloon Then in a far corner the BANGING of
chairs and a door SLAMMING Padens gun points that way but
there is no one there Only an overturned chair and an empty
pair of boots -- Padens

Paden picks up his hat and walks toward his boots Emmett
moves to the dead man unbuckles the gunbelt and pulls it
free of the body He picks up the bone-handled Colt and puts
it in the holster then stops abruptly We hear the steady
advance of FOOTSTEPS across the saloon floor Emmetts eyes
follow the off-screen presence

Paden seated is pulling on his newly-regained boots with a
delighted air when a shadow surges up and engulfs him He
looks up

Sheriff Langston towers over him

INT CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

Paden is brusquely deposited in the cell next to a surprised
Jake by Sheriff Langston and DEPUTY BLOCK

PADEN
Youre making a big mistake

Langston is not interested He and Block go out

JAKE
Thats what I told em

INT SHERIFFS OFFICE - NIGHT

Deputy Block eyes Emmett who loiters by the door as Langston
settles himself

LANGSTON
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail
too Then you could be with all your
friends

EMMETT
I havent done anything

LANGSTON
I want you out of town before the
hanging

EMMETT

Ill be long gone
OMIT
INT CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

Paden forlornly regards a snoring drunk in another cell as
Jake talks to him

JAKE
You mean you aint coming with Emmett

and me

PADEN
I cant say Im convinced youre
going anywhere

JAKE
Sure we are Were leaving at dawn

PADEN
Ive got no reason to run It was a
fair fight and there were plenty of
witnesses

JAKE
(bubbly)
Yeah thats what happened with me
too

PADEN
The other guy drew first

JAKE
(same for him)
Right

Paden looks a little discouraged but is still unconvinced
EXT GALLOWS - MAIN STREET - NIGHT

Emmett sits up on the new gallows in the deserted
intersection his legs dangling through the dropped trap
door Now he begins idly collecting wood shavings into a
little pile

INT CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

Paden steps close to the bars that separate the cells and
looks up at Jake who is dangling at arms length from one
of the overhead bars in his cell

PADEN
(whispering)
Your brother seems pretty good but
it isnt going to be easy getting in
here

Jake drops down to the floor
JAKE
He aint coming in were going out
(motions)
Gimme your belt

Paden trying to follow this unbuckles his belt

JAKE
Didnt he tell you about Blind Pete

PADEN
(handing him the belt)
We didnt get that far

JAKE
Blind Pete taught me a great trick

Jake grasps Padens belt by the buckle and snaps it at Paden
with a CRACK like a lion tamer

INT SHERIFFS OFFICE - DAWN

Deputy Block cheats at solitaire while Langston dozes at his
desk Now we hear FOOTSTEPS and BANGING outside

STABLE BOY (0S)
Sheriff Sheriff Open up

Block unlocks the door as Langston comes groggily to life A
STABLE BOY bounces at the door pointing off

STABLE BOY
Sheriff Langston come quick

He disappears Langston goes out calling back to Block --
LANGSTON
Lock this door and dont let anybody
in
EXT SHERIFFS OFFICE - DAWN
Langston hurries up the street after the Stable Boy
INT SHERIFFS OFFICE - DAWN
Deputy Block bolts the front door
PADEN (0OS)
(shouting)
Hey What are you doing you crazy

kid Dont do it

Block draws his six-gun and edges suspiciously toward the
door to the cellbloc

PADEN (0OS)
Oh Jesus Somebody stop him

Block turns the doorknob and pushes the door open with his
foot gun ready He moves into the cellblock

INT CELLBLOCK - DAWN

Block moves cautiously to where he can see the cells A
strange look crosses his face

Jake is hanging by the neck from the overhead bars two belts
forming the noose his head at a disgusting angle from his
body One foot gives a final twitch and he is still

PADEN
Cut him down For Gods sake cut

him down

Block is confused uncertain He doesnt want to go in there

PADEN
Hurry up You might be able to save
him

BLOCK

What for So we can hang him

Paden sincerely desperate now looks up at Jake whose face
is turning blue

PADEN
I think Im going to be sick when
I see what Langston does to you when
he gets here

Block lets it sink in then takes some keys from his belt

BLOCK
(to Paden)
You get way back there

Paden moves back quickly motioning for Block to hurry Block
holsters his six-gun opens Jakes cell door and goes inside
He gets up on the cot pulling a knife from a sheath He
strains up against Jakes body stretching to cut the belt

Suddenly Jake can stand it no longer he sputters to life
his long-held breath blasting in Blocks face Block
startled stumbles backwards off the cot raising the knife
threateningly Jake grabs the overhead bars swings up and
kicks Block in the chest The deputy careens across the cell
and hits the bars He throws the knife outside the cell and
draws his gun ready to shoot Jake

As Blocks finger pulls the trigger Padens thumb intrudes
between the hammer and the firing pin Paden has reached
through the bars behind Block to grasp the gun with his right
hand Now with his left he grabs a handful of Blocks hair
and slams the deputys head hard back against the bars As
Block slides unconscious to the floor Paden keeps the gun
wincingly uncocking it

PADEN
Got to be real quiet here

Jake has unhooked himself and is freeing his makeshift noose
He rubs his reddened neck
JAKE
(a hoarse whisper)
Right

EXT GALLOWS - DAWN

Langston huffs to a stop next to the Stable Boy his
countenance a picture of outraged befuddlement He the Stable
Boy and just one other surprised citizen are the only
witnesses the gallows is aflame burning like a pyre

Langston considers this phenomenon a suspicion slowly growing
in his mind

EXT SHERIFFS OFFICE - DAWN

Paden and Jake come out warily The street is deserted Paden
straps his holster on hes glad to have it back at last

Not as glad however as Jake who seems to have a nearly
religious relationship with his rig an elaborately tooled
double gunbelt with two pearl-handled Colts

JAKE
Thats the longest I ever did it
Bout bust a gut

PADEN
(finger to lips
quiet)
What now

JAKE
We wait

The two men move carefully off the porch and into the street

A wood stair goes up the outside of the jail to a door Now
high behind Jake Deputy Kern comes out nightshirt flapping
cocking the carbine in his hands He has thumped down five
steps before he focuses on Jake and Paden He starts to raise
the carbine

Both men see the deputy but Jakes reaction is so fast that
Paden need only watch Jake spins and before he has stopped
both his Colts are erupting in his hands The carbine flies
out of Kerns grasp and clatters down the steps Jake
continues to fire -- the stair at Kerns foot splinters and
he steps backwards and up Jake continues to splinter the
steps at Kerns feet until he has made the deputy exactly
retrace his steps and retreat back through the door The
firing stops

Paden gives Jake an odd look Paden may have seen someone
this fast and good before but he cant remember it He puts
his finger to his lips -- shhh

PADEN
Wheres your brother

JAKE
(reloading fast)
Hell be here

A bullet WHIZZES between the two men as we hear shots from
the far end of the street Langston is coming toward them
firing They move back to the cover of the jail porch

ALLEY ACROSS THE STREET Emmett roars into view riding his
horse and leading two others Padens bay and the pinto

A window above the jail breaks open and Kern starts firing
at Emmett

DOWN THE STREET Langston behind a wagon uses a British
two-handed grip to fire off a few rounds

Emmett brings the horses over and Paden swings quickly up
Jake focuses his attention unleashing a fusillade as Emmett
leads the pinto along the front of the jail

EMMETT
Jake come on

DOWN THE STREET Langston lifts his head from behind the now
bullet-pocked wagon Hes impressed

Jake runs along the porch hits the top of the hitching post
on the fly and takes off landing lightly in the saddle of
the pinto The three men gallop out of town in a cloud of
dust

EXT RIDE OUT OF TURLEY (VARIOUS SHOTS) - DAY

The three men ride hell-for-leather away from town At the

first bend they leave the road and head off cross-country

their horses straining up craggy hillsides and sliding down
dusty slopes There is some good riding going on here

OMIT
EXT THE CHASE (VARIOUS SHOTS) - DAY

INTERCUTTING the three men and the Posse Langston has raised
as the Posse closes ground over choppy terrain Now the three
fugitives come through some trees along the bank of a stream
and splash across to the other side

EXT A SPLIT IN THE TRAIL - THE CHASE CONTINUES - DAY

The three men come thundering along a dusty trail to the
place where it splits The high road disappears up the side
of a ridge the low road is really the bed of an arroyo The
three men exchange looks Paden plunges into the arroyo
Emmett shrugs to Jake and the brothers follow Paden
INTERCUTTING The Posse splashes across the stream The three
fugitives twist their way through the crooked arroyo

AT THE SPLIT IN THE TRAIL Langston pulls his group to a
halt He looks at the tracks leading into the arroyo anda
smile splits his face He leads the Posse up the high road
fast

EXT ARROYO - DAY

IN THE ARROYO Paden and Emmett pull up looking back at
Jake who has stopped at the last bend in the gully watching
their rear Now he rides up to the others

JAKE
I think we lost âem

EMMETT
Theres nobody coming

Jake shakes his head no Paden and Emmett exchange long
looks Paden looks to the ground above them even more
worried

PADEN
Oh-oh

They spur their horses out of there
EXT MOUTH OF ARROYOFLATLANDS - DAY

e three riders break out of the arroyo and exchange looks
Â£ glee on seeing the clear flatlands ahead SHOTS ring out
ey look over their shoulders to see Langstons Posse
ractically on top of them pouring over the lip of a rise
nd firing at will

MTHOH

e three men whip their horses and head flat out across the
pen space toward a cluster of boulders three hundred yards
way They are vulnerable and exposed as shots PING around
em They are not going to make it

atwonH

WITH THE POSSE Deputy Block jumps from his horse onto the
top of a boulder and lies prone bracing his Winchester for
an accurate shot

BLOCK
(to himself)
Lets see you fake this one kid

He is about to fire when suddenly the rocky surface in front
of his face explodes He is so startled he falls off the
boulder

Another Posse member is coming between two tall rocks when a
bullet hits near his head and ricochets into the rock on the
other side His horse rears up and the horse coming up behind
him collides with it

Langston and Deputy Kern have just started across the flats
but pull up next to a cactus at this new firing An arm of
the cactus is immediately severed by a 44 slug

KERN
Is that them shooting

LANGSTON
(pointing)
No Its coming from those rocks

WHAT HE SEES Paden Emmett and Jake are now halfway to the
cover of the distant rocks Another shot CRACKS and a puff
of smoke appears from ahead of them in the boulders

KERN
Lets go He aint hitting anything

LANGSTON
You idiot hes hit everything hes
aimed at

KERN

But they wont be out of our
jurisdiction till they pass Flat
Top

As Paden Emmett and Jake disappear among the boulders
Langston rises high in his stirrups to catch a final glimpse
His bowler is blown off his head He lowers himself back to
his saddle

LANGSTON
Today my jurisdiction ends here

He turns his horse back The others do likewise

LANGSTON
(over his shoulder
to Kern)
Pick up my hat

EXT BOULDERS - DAY

Emmett and Paden rein in their frothing horses in the natural
bowl of rocks near a tied horse and the remains of a campfire
Jake has stopped short of them and taken his horse back to
peer out toward the Posse Grinning he comes back to the
others The three riders bring their horses around and focus
on a spot above them

On the top of the highest boulder Mal leaves a comfortable
prone shooting position and eases himself down to a lower
rock A bandolier of 44 bullets dangles from one hand He
rests his Henry rifle at an angle across one shoulder

JAKE
(to the others)
This a friend of yours

PADEN
He is now

JAKE
Who is he

PADEN

Oh a guy who got run out of town

EMMETT
--just like us

EXT HIGH DESERT - DAY

An awesome rock spire soars into the perfect blue sky above
the orange desert The sight is spectacular The slow surge
of MUSIC exhilarating It is the perfect setting in which to
see the four horsemen who now appear on a ridge Here they
come --

Riding together side by side for the first time -- Emmett
Paden Jake and Mal

EXT HILL - DAY

The travellers crest a hill above a wide desert plain and
pull up at the surprising sight below -- there in the
distance stopped dead in a disorderly line is the wagon
train we saw leave Turley The horsemen exchange puzzled
looks

EXT WAGON TRAIN - DESERT PLAIN - DAY

The Settlers are clustered near a wagon as the four horsemen
ride down on them There is a tense silence as they dismount
and approach the group Hobart the leader steps forward to
meet them After a long perusal --

HOBART
(calling)
Its okay Zeke

From the cover of a nearby wagon Zeke appears lowering a
shotgun that had been trained on the newcomers

EMMETT
Hobart what are you people doing
here

HOBART

This is where Baxter and Hawley brung
us

EMMETT
Well theyre wrong This territory
is full of bad characters

HOBART
And they were two of them Look --

He gestures and the Settlers part to reveal the wagon which
held the money box in Turley The money box is gone but the
still form of its giant guardian Eb lies in the bed of the
wagon dead

HOBART
Baxter and Hawley killed poor Eb
here and stole our money box
(gestures)
They went north and were going after
them

The newcomers now see that a few of the Settler men and boys
are preparing to ride in pursuit Mal and Paden exchange
looks not terribly impressed

EMMETT
Forget the money Youve got to get
these people out of here This is no
place to be sitting with women and
kids

JAKE
Your next water aint for three days

HOBART
We got no life in Silverado without
that money Everybody put in thats
our whole stake

Paden looks around His gaze falls on Hannah somber now
but still lovely Conrad her husband stands beside her

Mal has been watching a little girl cling to the leg of one
of the Settler men who is going out on the chase Now the
black man quietly mounts his horse and speaks to an older
solid-looking man MR PARKER standing by his wife

MAL
How long have they been gone

MR PARKER
About an hour

Emmett and Paden watch Mal with interest Jake is excited by
this development He jumps up on his horse

JAKE
Ill go with you Mal

Paden isnt so quick to commit but then he notices Hannah
gazing up at Mal and Jake with radiant admiration He digests
that and moves toward his horse

PADEN
Deal me in

He steals a look at Hannah as he mounts up Emmett has watched
all this with growing resignation Now he speaks crisply
all business

EMMETT
Jake you know the way out of here
I want you to get this train moving
toward Silverado and fast Ill go
with these guys

Jake is disappointed but nods agreement Emmett turns to
Hobart and the Settler posse

EMMETT
You men stay with your wagons and
your families Get rolling and keep
your eyes peeled

Emmett moves toward his horse as Conrad rifle in hand
steps forward belligerently

CONRAD
Wait a minute If you do get the
money how do we know youll come
back

EMMETT
(flashes him a look
If we dont you can keep my brother

HOBART
(to Emmett)
Im trusting you mister

CONRAD
(to Hobart)
You trusted Baxter Im not letting
these men out of my sight

As Conrad moves toward his horse Paden looks at Hannah now
standing all alone Paden thinks he acted too quickly

EMMETT
(indicating Hannah)
If Id brought a pretty lady like
that into a place like this Id
stay close
Paden reacts to Emmetts interest in Hannah

CONRAD
Thats none of your business mister
Lets get going

PADEN
(quietly to Emmett)
I think you got a point Emmett
Maybe I better stay here with her

Emmett smiles and snaps his reins moving out with Mal
Reluctantly Paden follows twisting around for a last glimpse
of Hannah

WHAT HE SEES Hannah moves toward Conrads horse as if to
touch her husband But Conrad his face set in suspicion

barely nods farewell as he sweeps by her She looks after

him desolately

Mal Paden Emmett and Conrad ride off to the north as
Jake begins yelling orders to the Settlers to get things
moving What he lacks in expertise he makes up for in
enthusiasm

EXT HIGH DESERT (SERIES OF SHOTS) - DAY

The four men track the killers across the rugged terrain
Sometimes Emmett gets down from his horse to examine the
tracks

On a flat rocky expanse the chase party is temporarily
stalled Emmett and Paden confer balked Mal peering ahead
spots something and points it out to the two expert trackers
a steaming horse patty They head off in that direction

OMIT
EXT RIM OF BOX CANYON - DAY

The four men crawl to the lip of the canyon and get a clear
view of the activity below the box canyon has been turned
into a hideout for the Dawson Gang a band of border raiders
There are about twenty-five outlaws moving about among the
tents caves and wagons of the encampment Their horses are
penned in a natural alcove in the rock off the main floor of
the canyon

The strongbox from the wagon train sits on the tailgate of a
wagon Next to it is a large keg of whiskey from which the
outlaws are drawing generous portions Baxter and Hawley
have brought the loot proudly back to their cohorts and the
celebration is centered around this wagon

On the rim the pursuers exchange looks in reaction to this
new situation
PADEN
(to Emmett)
You know hanging around with you is
no picnic

EMMETT
Anybody got any ideas

EXT OUTLAW CAMP - BOX CANYON - DAY

One of the outlaws spills some whiskey onto the money in the
strongbox DAWSON the leader of the gang angrily slams the
strongbox closed and kicks the offending outlaw Suddenly
there are cries of warning from the Sentinel at the entrance
to the box canyon HOOFBEATS echo into the canyon from that
direction The outlaws react en masse with a frightening
display of armed readiness

WHERE THE TRAIL ENTERS THE CANYON From the shadows emerge
two galloping horses on the first is Emmett who holds the
reins of the second across whose saddle is draped the
seemingly lifeless body of Paden The Sentinel watches them
pass under the point of his carbine

AT THE WAGON Emmett dismounts quickly and ties both horses
to a wheel Dawson decides not to shoot this guy yet He
watches as Emmett runs back across the canyon to the cover
of some crates and crouches down behind them looking up at
the rim above the entrance The outlaws guns pointed stand
around him

TALL OUTLAW
(to Dawson)
Should I kill him Mr Dawson

DAWSON
(approaching Emmett)
In a minute

Emmett still cowering looks over his shoulder at Dawson
He speaks now and throughout very fast

EMMETT
I wouldnt do that Youre going to
need every gun when that posse gets

here

DAWSON
Posse What the hell you talking
about

EMMETT

My partner and me robbed the bank in
Turley and headed out with a posse

on our tails My partner there caught
one a ways back and I think he kicked
off while I was looking for this
damn canyon Youre Dawson aint

(offers his hand for

only a second)
Used to ride with Ry Morris You
know him Well Andy Sims told me
there was a hideout here so I headed
for it Hope you dont mind

Paden lying over the saddle his face shielded by his hat
winces at this story

DAWSON
You brought a posse to my best hideout
and you want to know if I mind
Mister I dont know any of those
names and youre about to die

EMMETT
Wait a minute If you dont believe
me ask them
(indicates Baxter and
Hawley)
they saw me and my pal in Turley
before we did the job

Baxter and Hawley peer at Emmett and nod to each other

BAXTER
I saw em there all right but I
dont know about any bank job

DAWSON
If you took the bank in Turley
wheres the money

Emmett crouches lower looking nervously at the rocks

EMMETT
Id get down if I were you They may
be up there now

DAWSON
(just as he suspected)
No money eh

EMMETT
The moneys in my saddlebags over
there but I aint stepping out to
get it

The outlaws all of whom are standing in the open think
hes crazy Dawson motions Hawley toward Emmetts horse
Hawley is almost there when gunfire erupts from the rocks
above and Hawley goes down dead Now all the outlaws hit the
dirt some firing wildly Paden unobtrusively frees his rope
Dawson comes down beside Emmett
EXT RIM OF BOX CANYON - DAY

Conrad and Mal fire into the canyon then move to new
positions

EXT OUTLAW CAMP - DAY

ABOVE THE ENTRANCE to the box canyon the Sentinel disappears
into the rocks moving upward

AT THE CRATES Down the line from Emmett an outlaw gets
hit The outlaws cant see anything to shoot at

EMMETT
(agitated)
If we charge them they wont have a
chance But we gotta get to the
horses

DAWSON
What do you mean the horses

Emmett jumps up He yells to the other outlaws

EMMETT
Cover me

He runs in a mad zig-zag toward the gate of the horses pen
EXT RIM OF BOX CANYON - DAY

Mal firing rapidly follows Emmetts route with precision
EXT OUTLAW CAMP - DAY

Mals shots kick up dust inches from Emmetts flying feet
Once Emmett throws a glance upwards Mals cutting it pretty
close Baxter slides in next to Dawson who is thinking hard

BAXTER
(indicating Emmett)
Brave man

DAWSON
I think theres only a couple of
guys up there and this assholes one
of them

AT THE WAGON An outlaw is cowering beneath the wagon but
doesnt notice as Paden reaches out and secures the latch on
the money box

AT THE HORSE PEN Emmett throws open the make-shift gate and
runs in among the horses yelling and waving his arms The
horses begin to run out of the pen
AT THE CRATES Dawson jumps up and orders his men forward A
line of outlaws rushes toward the pen all the while firing
up at the rim Paden appears at a gallop from behind pulling
Emmetts horse beside him A rope stretches from his
saddlehorn to the strongbox bouncing along in the dirt

Paden comes through the line of outlaws firing and heads for
the pen A few of the outlaws make the mistake of closing
the gap and aiming at Padens back The bouncing strongbox
knocks them head over heels

Emmett leaps from a rock onto his passing horse firing behind
him He and Paden go down the trail in the midst of the
outlaws horses The strongbox careens after them

EXT MOUTH OF CANYON TRAIL - DAY

Mal and Conrad mounted are waiting as Emmett and Paden

ride out of the mouth of the canyon Beyond them the outlaws
horses scatter toward the horizon Paden jumps off his horse
and picks up the strongbox

IN THE ROCKS ABOVE THEM the Sentinel from the outlaw camp
positions himself to fire at the men below

EMMETT
(to Mal)
That was some idea of yours Next
time you go in

Paden is tying the strongbox to his saddlehorn when there is
the loud CLICK of Conrads rifle being cocked He nervously
points it at the others

CONRAD
I knew it Put that box on my horse

MAL

A SHOT rings out Conrad takes it in the chest and flies off
his horse Now an amazing sight -- Emmett Paden and Mal

EXT FORK OF THE ROAD (OUTSIDE SILVERADO) - DAY

A buckboard with a man and a young girl in it is stopped at
the fork its two occupants standing up and waving excitedly

As the wagon train pulls to a halt Hobart climbs down from
the lead wagon and is embraced by the homesteader from the
buckboard BRADLEY

Bradley points off along the right fork of the road as he
speaks to Hobart

BRADLEY
Its right down this road aways
Ill ride in with you myself
(to the girl in the
buckboard)
Carol go spread the word our people
are here

The girl CAROL whips the buckboard into motion and
disappears down the road Bradley is looking down the line
of wagons

BRADLEY

I thought thered be more of you
But I thank the Lord for each and
every one Well have a solid strip
of bottomland under the plow when
you people stake your claims

(a grim look at Hobart)
And were going to need every hand
to hold it

AT HANNAHS WAGON Emmett has brought his horse up to face
Hannah and on horseback beside her wagon Paden

EMMETT
Hope to see you again mam

She nods demurely

PADEN

I think Ill ride along with the
lady here Just take a look at this
farmland before I come into Silverado
See what makes a trip this hard worth
taking

(catches Emmetts

amused look)
Ill see you around

EMMETT
Ill be around

AT THE LEAD WAGON Hobart has what might be tears in his
eyes as he picks up the reins and looks at the countryside

HOBART
I feel like Ive arrived in Canaan

BRADLEY
When we got here we thought it was
Eden And its pretty close -- right

down to the serpents

The wagon train moves out along the right fork of the road
as Emmett and Jake waving goodbye ride straight ahead toward
town

EXT ENTERING SILVERADO - DAY
Silverado is a sprawling active handsome frontier town a

cattle center and supply station for the burgeoning silver
mines to the west Emmett and Jake ride into town
OMIT
EXT COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Mal comes around the shoulder of a hill and reins to a halt
He takes the yellowed letter from his pocket and checks a
detail He smiles at the stand of cottonwoods that marks his
route After all these years hes excited to be approaching
some kind of home He hurries on

EXT LAND OFFICEHOLLIS HOME (SILVERADO) - DAY

The land office is in the front of the first floor of the
Hollis home a separate two-story structure on a side street

Now were looking down the porch as KATE HOLLIS embraces her
brothers Emmett and Jake Her big bear-like gentle husband
JT comes out to add his greetings After the laying on of
hands the attention of all four is drawn to the doorway and
a figure we cannot yet see

Now he steps shyly into view eleven-year-old AUGIE Jake
makes a show of shaking Augies hand man to man Emmett
kneels to greet him at eye level the boys grown a lot in
five years

EXT HILL - DAY

Mal reaches the top of the hill a look of high expectation
on his face But now he pulls up sharply his expression
changing Not what he expected

Down below in a pretty little valley that recently embraced
a farm are hundreds of cattle roaming free across the last

remnants of the fields And the burnt-out remains of a small
farmhouse

EXT FARMHOUSE RUINS - DAY

Mal dismounts near the blackened timbers and walks into the
ruins He looks around in a daze hes home but theres no
home there

EXT KNOLL ABOVE BRADLEYS PLACE (HOMESTEADER LAND) - DUSK

Paden and Hannah are just reaching the top of the knoll In
the distance below them is Bradleys farm in the barnyard
of which the wagon train has pulled up for this first night

HANNAH
Mr and Mrs Parker have agreed to
join their parcel to mine Well
work them together
(she points)
Mine starts right over there Its
all Ive ever wanted Pretty land
isnt it

PADEN
(nods looking at her)
And a pretty lady

She turns to face him with a clear-eyed gaze that is almost
scary

HANNAH
A lot of men have told me that Maybe
its true I guess some women are
slow to believe it

PADEN
Believe it

HANNAH
Theyre drawn to me by that But it
never lasts

PADEN
Why

HANNAH
Because they dont like what I want

PADEN
Whats that

HANNAH
(turns back toward
her view)
I want to build something make things
grow That takes hard work -- a
lifetime of it Thats not why men
come to a pretty woman

He shakes his head agreeing though she cannot see it
HANNAH
After a while I wont be so pretty
But this land will be
She turns to face him again He understands now as well as
she that romance is not in their future But friendship could
be
PADEN
Hannah dont tell me what you think
I want to hear
Hannah laughs with him
EXT FARMHOUSE RUINS - NIGHT

Mal has made a fire in the remains of the fireplace and is
cooking food As he sits back he senses he is being watched

He turns There at the edge of the light stands an old black
man holding a Henry 44 rifle like Mals -- his father EZRA
JOHNSON The two men look at each other a long time

MAL
Daddy

EZRA
I saw the light I thought maybe Rae
had come back to see me But I never
thought itd be my boy I never
thought that

Mal goes to him and encloses him in his arms

MAL
Ma

Ezra looks up at him and shakes his head

Mal takes

EZRA
She was sick for a long time She
was sick when she wrote you but she
didnt say it I never thought youd
come But she did

it hard They move back to the fire together

MAL
Where is Rae

EZRA
Shes gone gone to town She hated
working on the farm
(a bitter glance)
-just like you

MAL
(gestures)

What happened

EZRA

They run me off They burned me out
They made it so I couldnt do Just
like Georgia If you wont sell
they take it anyway
MAL
Who
EZRA
(as though it were
obvious)

he cattle This valley runs down to
a clear creek Thats why we picked
his spot and thats why they dont

ct
want us here

MAL
You own this land

EZRA

I paid the government for it all
right That dont mean much out here

(he motions behind

him)
Malachi Im living like a wildcat
in a cave in those hills Hiding
out afraid to walk my own land

MAL
What about the law

EZRA
Whose law The law here runs a man
down -- just like these cattle

Mal thinks about that and grows very angry Finally --

MAL
That aint right and Ive had enough
of what aint right

INT HOLLIS HOME (SILVERADO) - NIGHT

The group is finishing dinner in the kitchensitting room at
the back of the ground floor Augie is tooting the carved
whistle pipe that Emmett has given him Kate and Emmett begin
to clear the dishes as Jake and JT continue to sit

JAKE

I thought running the land office
would be easy work JT but it
sounds like what you got here aint
much fun

JT

We got a bad situation here and
those homesteaders you brought in
with you are going to make it worse
(indicates front of

house)

When they come into this office to
stake their claims I think its
going to be the start of real trouble
Theyre going to cut McKendrick off
on the north

KATE
JTs done everything he can I
married a brave man Augie take
that delightful gift your uncle gave
you out of here while were talking
(back to others)
McKendrick picked the new sheriff
himself so JT cant even get the
law enforced

JT
Half the gunslingers that drift into
town turn up on our police force

EMMETT
A man could die of thirst before
anybody offered him a drink around
here

JT pulls a bottle of whiskey from a cabinet and sets up
three glasses but Kate pantomimes for him to add one for
her

EMMETT
Maybe you all ought to come to
California with Jake and me
(across the room)
How âbout it Augie you want to go
with us

AUGIE
Sure

JAKE
You know Augie there are no schools
in California

AUGIE
(aglow)
Really

KATE
Augies going to grow up here Theres
nothing wrong with the land its
just some of the people

JT
The problem is Emmett you killed
the wrong McKendrick

KATE
Why JT watch what youre saying
around Augie Emmett didnt kill
anybody

EMMETT
Well Kate it was self-defense sure
enough but I think youd have to
say I killed old Murdo I think thats
definitely the word

JAKE
It was my fault

KATE
It was not -- it was Murdos Those
McKendricks dont know how to act
like human beings

JT

His son is worse than he was Hes
smoother so you dont always hear
him coming but hell do anything to
keep his range free

KATE
(intensely)
Im worried what hes going to do
when he finds out you boys are back

Emmett puts his arm around her

EMMETT
I think Jake here can take care of
himself I did five years I didnt
owe McKendrick ought to be satisfied
with that and let it lie

Kate looks between her brothers She is not reassured
EXT FARMHOUSE RUINS - NIGHT
Having smothered the fire Mal mounts up then reaches down
to pull his father onto the horse behind him They begin

picking their way through the cattle when two night-riding
cowboys RED and SCRUFFY approach through the gloom

RED
Is that you Ezra

SCRUFFY
(to his mate jovially)
You see pretty good Red Is there
one or two of them
(He laughs)
What brings you out of your hole
Johnson

RED
Were going to find that place one
of these days Who you got with you
Ezra

EZRA
This is my son Hes come home

SCRUFFY
Aint that sweet Red Im afraid
you boys are trespassing on McKendrick
land

MAL
You got it all wrong mister This
is our place

RED
What Mr McKendrick bought this
place from your father

EZRA
Thats a lie

MAL
Tomorrow were going to town to
straighten that out once and for
all The next day well be back
here farming And these cattle
better be gone

The two cowboys are taken aback They look to each other for
guidance

MAL
If I find any cattle on our land
after tomorrow Im going to start
carving them into steaks And believe
me thats one thing I know about

SCRUFFY
Killing cattle is a hanging offense
in these parts If we shot you down
right now wed be within our rights

MAL
Mister you ever seen what a Henry
rifle can do in the hands of someone
who knows how to use it

The two cowboys tense their gun hands flexing

SCRUFFY
Who would that be You

Behind Mal Ezra lowers the barrel of his own Henry toward
the cowboys and cocks it He looks like a man coming back to
life The two cowboys are dumbfounded They turn and start
to ride away Scruffy shouts back at them --

SCRUFFY
This aint the end of it

MAL
(to Ezra)
Were going to get your land back
Daddy our land
EZRA
(marvelling at events)
Maybe we will Maybe we will
(pause)
After all I never thought Id get
my son back

EXT MAIN STREET - NIGHT

Paden rides along the dark street drawn irresistibly toward
the thinking MUSIC lights and hubbub of the big saloon --
The Midnight Star

INT MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

Paden comes in and looks around with some pleasure Its an
expansive place busy now with gamblers drinkers and
brightly-dressed saloon girls A piano player bangs away in
the corner Paden has to smile This is the way a saloon
ought to be Now even Paden is home

Paden walks up to stand at the bar The BARTENDER is busy at
the far end of the bar Paden is patiently waiting to get
his attention when he hears a womans voice behind him on
his side of the bar

STELLA (0OS)
What can I do you for stranger

Paden turns to face his interlocutor but at first cannot
find her After a moment though he looks down to see a
small woman in a velvet dress -- STELLA

PADEN
You work here

STELLA
I run the place What can I get you

She is already moving away toward the near end of the bar
He watches her disappear around the end then sees the top
of her head appear behind the bar down there As she moves
back toward him she gets taller and taller until she is

facing him eye to eye across the bar

PADEN
Bourbon

As she reaches under the bar and produces bottle and glass
Paden leans over and peeks behind the bar A foot-wide ramp
runs the length of it

PADEN
Nifty

STELLA
(smiles)
The world is what you make of it
friend If it doesnt fit you make
alterations

PADEN
Ill drink to that Will you join
me Miss --

STELLA
Stella

PADEN
Paden

Stella sets up a glass for herself and they shake hands
Paden looks up at a carved ornamental star on the back wall
over the words The Midnight Star

PADEN
Stella Are you the midnight star
herself

STELLA

I am Im always there but I only
shine at night

A saloon girl -- a lovely young black woman -- RAE passes
with some drinks Paden watches her go then looks around
the room

PADEN
My compliments to you Miss Stella
This is what I call a saloon

STELLA
Thanks Thats what I call it too

PADEN
And I know what Im talking about

STELLA
You like a good saloon

PADEN
Its the only place Im happy

STELLA
Me too Whats wrong with us

Their eyes meet for a moment and a real connection is made
PADEN
You wouldnt be needing any help
around here would you Maybe with

the gambling

STELLA
(points)
You see that fellow over there in
the gray coat

Paden nods and now we see him too a big man in some gambler-
like finery -- KELLY He is leaning over a poker game

STELLA
Thats Kelly my so-called partner
He runs that side

PADEN
So-called

STELLA
Yeah aside from being a loud-mouthed
lying cheat hes just the man I
would have picked

PADEN
Whyd you go into business with him

STELLA
I dont own this place The man who
does stuck me with Kelly

PADEN
Whos the owner

STELLA
Here he comes right now

Stella nods toward the door and Paden turns to look Cobb
enters through the swinging doors He looks around with a
proprietary air as he walks to the bar He is almost there
before his gaze settles on Paden and Stella He stops in his
tracks and a big grin splits his face

SHERIFF COBB
Well look at this Two of my favorite
people in the world talking to each
other

Cobb moves up and puts an arm around Paden as he shakes his
hand Stella is interested in this connection but she doesnt
faze easily Paden is the surprised one

SHERIFF COBB
Stella this is one of my oldest
surviving friends Treat him right

STELLA
That was my plan

SHERIFF COBB
(laughs)
Oh yeah you two are going to get
along fine You got a lot in common
Cobb looks across the room and yells

SHERIFF COBB
Kelly get over here
(to Paden)
You didnt come all this way just to
pay me back that money did you
(turns to Kelly)
Kelly meet my friend Paden

KELLY
(cool)
Howdy

SHERIFF COBB
Give the man a line of credit He
already owes the house thirteen bucks

Kelly casts a wary appraising glance over Paden nods and
moves off

SHERIFF COBB
You got a place to stay

PADEN
I just got to town

SHERIFF COBB
Stella we still got an extra room
out back dont we

STELLA
Its not in use at the moment

Cobb comes around the end of the bar to stand next to Stella

SHERIFF COBB
What brings you into my saloon

PADEN
Luck I guess

SHERIFF COBB
(cackles at this)
Good old Paden I was hoping youd
changed your mind about the job

PADEN
You didnt tell me you owned a saloon

Cobb looks at Paden a long time and laughs

SHERIFF COBB
That aint the half of it friend
He turns away taking off his coat and hangs it on a peg
back there When he turns back rolling up his sleeves our
eyes are drawn to the same thing as Padens a shiny silver
sheriffs star

SHERIFF COBB
Welcome to heaven

INT CAVE - MORNING

Mal is asleep on some hay in the small cave his father has
fixed up as a hideout and home A shadow falls across him

Ezra stands looking at his son with loving eyes In his hands
are a water bucket and his Henry rifle Now he turns quietly
away

off into the rocks

EXT ROCKY HILLSIDE - MORNING
Ezra picks his way among the boulders warily
EXT MOUNTAIN SPRING - MORNING

Ezra comes out of the surrounding rocks and goes to the edge
of the spring A stream runs off downhill from the pool He
props the rifle against a rock and bends to drink from the
spring He hears something and turns quickly What he sees
makes him reach for the rifle but the sound of several GUNS
COCKING freezes him inches from it

There are four Cowboys McKendricks men emerging from their
hiding places Their eyes search the surrounding rocks
Scruffy and Red the cowboys from the previous night are
there but the leader is HOYT

HOYT
Wheres the other one Johnson

Ezra is silent

HOYT
You couldnt leave well enough alone

(resigned)
Our orders are to run you two off
If you tell us where your son is we
wont have to do any shooting

EZRA
Youre lying Hoyt like always
HOYT

Ezra thinks a moment looks over at Scruffy then back to
Hoyt

EZRA
My sons on his way to town

HOYT

The distant ROAR OF GUNS echoes in the small space Mal awakes
with a start Did he dream it He looks around

MAL

EXT ROCKY HILLSIDE - MORNING

Mal rifle in hand and frantic is lost among the rocks Now
he stops listening He hears HOOFBEATS He scrambles to the
top of a boulder and looks down

WHAT HE SEES The four Cowboys far below are riding away
from the base of the hill

EXT MOUNTAIN SPRING - MORNING

Mal comes out of the rocks Ezras rifle is no longer propped
where he left it Ezra is gone Mal rushes to the edge of

the spring in agony He looks around desperately and then
freezes

Ezras dead body is floating away down the mountain stream
Mal splashes into the water tripping and sliding on the
slippery rocks Finally he is able to reach Ezra Mal sits
in the water and hugs his father to him

INT SALOON - MIDNIGHT STAR - MORNING

Only a few customers Early light streams in over gambling
tables draped with dust covers Stella is busy behind the
bar Paden and Emmett are nursing cups of coffee at a table

PADEN
Hannahs a smart pretty woman but

EMMETT
(doesnt follow)

PADEN
All Im saying is you wont trip

EMMETT

Cobb comes in the swinging doors heading for the bar Paden
waves him over

PADEN
Cobb I want you to meet Emmett
Hes a friend of mine
(to Emmett)
This is Sheriff Cobb

EMMETT
(shaking hands)
Pleased to meet you Sheriff

SHERIFF COBB
(interested)
Pleasure is mine Always happy to

(yelling to Stella)
Stella bring Kelly out here will
you

Cobb turns back to Emmett with an odd smile on his face

SHERIFF COBB
Youre Kate Hollis brother arent
you
(Emmett nods)
Youre the one who killed old Murdo
McKendrick

Paden watches as the two men let that hang between them

EMMETT
Didnt have much choice He was about
to shoot my brother in the back

SHERIFF COBB
Cant be having that now can we

Stella appears with Kelly who speaks to Cobb

KELLY
You wanted to see me

SHERIFF COBB
Were going to make some adjustments
I wanted you to be here when I offered
Paden your job I think he could do
it without getting greedy Stella
and I are tired of you skimming our
profits

Stella is surprised The charge is true but she didnt know
this was coming

KELLY
What are you talking about

SHERIFF COBB
Im done talking Get out

KELLY
You cant do this

SHERIFF COBB
(smiling)
Really

Without warning Cobb hits Kelly viciously in the stomach
Stella jumps Cobb grabs the doubled-over Kelly by the hair
and the belt and propels him out of the saloon letting go
before Kelly crashes through the swinging doors and into the
street Cobb comes back toward the table as though nothing
had happened

SHERIFF COBB
How about it Paden You want the
job

Paden considering glances at the still swinging doors

PADEN
I see youre an understanding boss

Cobb chuckles picks up Padens coffee cup and takes a sip
SHERIFF COBB
Nothing like that will happen between

us

PADEN
Maybe we ought to ask Stella

He turns toward her She likes the idea

STELLA
Youd be welcome

She is smiling at him warmly when suddenly her eyes shift
her expression changes and she screams --

STELLA
No Kelly Hell kill you

Cobb is already in motion He spins drawing his gun and
fires repeatedly at the swinging doors Kelly has been aiming
over them and is blasted back into the street as the slats
splinter Cobb holsters his gun The coffee cup is still in
his other hand He takes a final sip puts the cup down and
licks a spilled drop off his thumb

Stella is repulsed Cobb fixes her with a malevolent look
and his tone is icy --

SHERIFF COBB
Thanks for warning me

Stella rushes out to the street as Emmett and Paden get up
Emmett and Cobb are very close for one moment

SHERIFF COBB
Didnt have much choice

They go out through the gathering crowd
EXT MAIN STREET - DAY

Down the street a stagecoach is rolling into town Cobb steps
off the porch to kneel beside Kellys body He looks across
at the already-kneeling Stella

SHERIFF COBB
I never enjoy killing a man

Stella stands so for a moment she is taller than he She
stalks back into the saloon

The stagecoach has pulled up across the street A tall lanky
gambler has disembarked and now walks toward the saloon
carrying his heavy satchel He moves through the assembled
people until he is standing over Kellys body This is SLICK

SLICK
Excuse me Sheriff Im a gambler
who would like to run an honest game
in your town To whom do I speak
about that
(glances down)
I hope its not this gentleman

Cobb likes his style He smiles and turns to indicate Paden

SHERIFF COBB
Thats him

Paden and Cobb exchange looks for a second Then Cobb is
bustling off

SHERIFF COBB
I gotta get somebody to clean up
this mess
Emmett and Paden watch Cobb move down the street

EMMETT
You used to ride with that guy

Paden looks at Emmett then down at Kelly
EXT REAR OF HOLLIS HOME - DAY

Jake unhitches the pinto and begins to lead it away Suddenly
Augie appears from nowhere on the back porch jumps up to

the railing and leaps out toward the pintos back -- just

as Jake did in the escape from Turley But Augie misses and
lands in the dirt Jake irritated watches the child dust
himself off

JAKE

Jake turns and starts away Augie runs after him

AUGIE
Where you going

JAKE

INT SUPPLY ROOM - MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

Stella works at the spigots of some large kegs filling empty
bottles with a portion of whiskey diluting them with water
and corking them Paden comes in and watches her She hands
him a bottle to cork and starts the process again as he shakes
it

PADEN

Is this a fair mix

STELLA
Im saving lives here The straight
stuff would raise a blood blister on
boot leather

PADEN
I meant seemed like a lot of whiskey

They share a smile Paden takes down a fancier bottle froma
shelf examining the label

PADEN
Whats this

STELLA
Thats the good stuff

PADEN
Oh yeah How good

She understands him and produces two glasses with a grin

PADEN
(pouring the drinks
Heres to the good stuff

Stella lifts her glass sealing the bond

STELLA
May it last a long time

Before they can drink the Bartender bursts in

BARTENDER
You better get out here

INT SALOON - MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

The room is crowded but silent frozen Near the middle of
the bar the sexy young saloon girl PHOEBE stands
frightened between Jake and Tyree the mean fellow we saw
released at Chimayo -- now a deputy for Sheriff Cobb The
two men appear about to draw

PHOEBE
Nothing happened Tyree This is my
job

TYREE
Shut up

JAKE

I dont believe a lady has to explain
anything to a man this ugly

Slick watches from a card table nearby with Rae standing
beside him Now his hand drops casually from the curve of

her rear to the vicinity of his boot

Paden and Stella come up on opposite sides of the bar him
in front Paden sees everything in the room Tyrees friends
Deputies Kyle and GARTH are behind Jake and clearly poised
to kill him if Tyree fails

PADEN
Whats the problem here

TYREE
(with venom)
Stay out of it Paden

STELLA
He cant do that Tyree Cobbs hired
him

TYREE

Thats Cobbs mistake

STELLA
Come out of there Phoebe Youve
done enough

As Phoebe starts to move from between the men Tyree grabs
her viciously by the arm In the instant of that movement
Padens hand flashes out and draws Tyrees Colt out of its
holster from behind Garth and Kyle tense as Tyree whirls on
Paden eyes flaming But his own gun is pointed at his chest

PADEN
Get out of here Jake

JAKE
All I did was kiss the girl

PADEN
Thats what you said in Turley You
remember how that ended

JAKE
Whats the matter Paden You afraid
I couldnt get those two behind me

PADEN
I dont want you getting anyone in
my place

Jake looks at Paden who motions him out with the gun Jake
starts to move grudgingly but first flashes Phoebe a big
see you later look He goes out

TYREE
(to Paden)
I should have killed you a long time
ago

Paden flips the gun in his grasp and hands it to Tyree butt
first
PADEN
Why not now

The situation is now totally reversed and no one can quite
believe it Tyree cocks the gun At the poker table Slick
lifts his pant leg revealing the handle of a custom-made
dagger secreted in his boot

STELLA
Dont do it Tyree I just lost a
partner If you kill him Ill never
get anyone to work here

Tyree considers for a moment then holsters his gun To Stella

TYREE
Better start looking

He goes out Garth and Kyle follow Phoebe hurries away from
Stellas hard look Slick relaxes The piano kicks in Paden
leans against the bar toward Stella

STELLA
You really are a gambler

PADEN
Give me some of the good stuff

EXT ROOMING HOUSE - DAY

A door opens on the upstairs porch and Rae emerges giggling
and buttoning her dress A hand reaches out and pulls her
back inside for another squealing embrace She pushes herself
free and comes outside again then starts down the exterior
stairs She is almost to the bottom when she stops suddenly

Mal stands at the bottom of the stairs They look at each
other a long time Conflicting emotions race across Raes
face but the winner is cold anger

MAL
Hello Rae

RAE
What are you doing here I thought
you were done with our family

MAL
Daddys dead

Rae seems to sway then sits down on the stairs above Mal
For a moment she is somewhere else but when she returns

her look is as hard as before

MAL
He was murdered

RAE
Who did it

MAL
m not sure but I got an idea And
when I am sure theyre going to
pay

H

RAE
(bitter)
Oh thats just fine Where were you
when Ma and Daddy needed you Its
too late Mal Now you finally show
up and all you can think of is to
get yourself killed

Now Slick comes down the stairs behind Rae pulling on his
jacket Mal glares at him this is who can buy his sister
now

SLICK
Are you all right Rae

RAE
Yeah Im okay

Slick seems unperturbed by Mals glare To Rae --

SLICK
Will you introduce me to your friend

RAE
Hes not my friend He used to be my
brother

SLICK
(offers his hand to
Mal)
Calvin Stanhope but my mother
called me Slick

Mal just looks at the proffered hand Slick retracts it
without offense

SLICK
I know what youre thinking mister
but I think Raes a special lady
Excuse me

Slick comes down past Mal and moves off Mal watches him go
then turns to Rae

MAL
What are you doing here Rae This
aint for you
RAE
Its none of your business

MAL
Rae all we got is each other

RAE
(standing up)
I dont have any family any more

She brushes past him and is gone
OMIT
EXT BRADLEYS PLACE - NIGHT

Carol Bradleys daughter and a Friend are playing on the
roof of the farmhouse above the noisy activity of the
welcoming celebration Now Bradley steps into the foreground

BRADLEY
Dont fall off of there you fools

HOBART
Might do them some good Daniel I
wasnt worth a damn until I fell off
the barn on my head

The two men turn to look at the dancing Its a festive scene
all around tables are laden with food near a large bonfire
a few of the covered wagons are pulled up nearby children
dart about before the pick-up band of musicians

Now we see here among the sodbusters whirling by with a
comely lass Jake looking mighty slim without his double
gunbelt He and his partner glide by Emmett who stands

shouting over the din with Hannah and Mr and MRS PARKER

MRS PARKER
Hannahs the hardest-working gal I
ever saw

MR PARKER
Its going to be all right

EMMETT
I wish you the best Mrs Parker

Mr Parker twirls his wife off into the dance Emmett and
Hannah a slightly awkward couple stroll away from the music

This is the first time Emmett has seemed less than certain

EMMETT
The Parkers seem like nice folks

HANNAH
Theyve been kind to me

EMMETT
(after a few steps)
Paden sends his best

HANNAH
(smiles)

I guess I put a good scare into him

Emmett smiles in agreement

HANNAH
Im surprised to see you out here
tonight

EMMETT

I just came out to say goodbye

HANNAH
(stopped)
Goodbye
EMMETT

Yeah me and Jake will be heading
out for California soon

Hannah is silent for a moment She sits down at one of the
tables and looks at him For the first time there is a
softness in her voice

HANNAH
You came all the way out here to
tell me youre going to California
All you had to do was go and wed
never see each other again

EMMETT
Thats why Im here

She gives him an odd look a soft challenge to his reticence

HANNAH
Why

He sits down beside her and looks at his boots

EMMETT
You dont make it easy on a fellow

HANNAH
Didnt Paden tell you that

Emmett smiles at that and looks into her lovely eyes After
a long moment --

HANNAH
Maybe you thought youd be back this
way someday

EMMETT
Yeah that must have been it

UP ON THE ROOF of the farmhouse Carol is yelling and
gesturing to her oblivious father below while her Friend
stares frozen into the night

Jake is wiping his brow as he stands at the edge of the
dancers He looks up at Carol quizzically

Only now do we hear it over the din of the music the THUNDER
of hooves Out of the night streaming around the farm
buildings comes a horde of masked Cowboys McKendricks

men They send up a horrible yell and begin firing their
weapons in the air

Their arrival is so sudden that the celebrants are frozen in
their places mothers hugging children to them men far from
their weapons There are SCREAMS

Emmett grabs a panicked child from the path of the horses
and moves back passing her to Hannah Hes trying to gauge
his response in the midst of all these innocents

Two Cowboys have roped opposite ends of a section of fence
and now pull the deadly drag already thick with ravaged
corn through the barnyard knocking over everything in its
path

Jake slides through the chaos toward his gunbelt hung on a
peg on the barn wall

A Cowboy pulls the gate from the pigsty and the pigs squeal
out Another Cowboy begins shooting them with a Henry rifle
On the roof Carol looks in horror at the death of her prize
sow

Emmett is herding as many Settlers as he can toward the cover
of the barn

Bradley edges toward the door of his farmhouse

Hobart is urging some women between two wagons A Cowboy
rides by and kicks him viciously

Hoyt pulls up looks around then gestures to some of his
men Two Cowboys with prepared torches in their hands ride
up to the bonfire and swing low lighting their firebrands
One moves ahead toward the farmhouse reins his horse and
heaves the torch high in the air toward the roof on which
the two children perch

In the air the tumbling flame suddenly explodes at the ROAR
of a shotgun Sparks shower harmlessly to the ground
Bradley has shot it out of the air with one barrel of his
shotgun The blast has created a momentary shocked lull in
the attack Bradley looks wild

Emmett watches fearful His hand is on his gun

Hoyt looks at Bradley Bradley swings the shotgun around
toward the other torch-bearer

The Cowboy who tossed the first torch shoots Bradley dead
Carol screams

Emmett looks across the yard at Jake who steps out from the
cowering homesteaders a gun in each hand Emmett draws and
kills the man who shot Bradley Now all the Settlers hit the
dirt

Jake fires from both hands repeatedly One Cowboy dies and
another takes it in the arm The man who was shooting the

pigs swings his rifle around toward Jake and Emmett kills
him with one shot

Hoyt reacts big to the presence of deadly wolves in the midst
of these sheep He peers through the tumult trying to see
their faces His Cowboys are shooting wildly into the crowd
now but he rides through them signalling a retreat

Emmett jumps from the top of a fence to the roof of the house
the Henry rifle in his hand He scrambles to the peak of the
roof where the two children still cower Bracing the rifle
on the chimney he takes careful aim Once twice he
fires One Cowboy dead one wounded and fleeing

Hannah runs up to the riderless horse of a fallen Cowboy and
pulls a rifle from its scabbard She cocks it and fires off

at the retreating Cowboys Jake mounts a horse Pony Express-
style and rides out of the barnyard

OMIT
EXT BRADLEYS PLACE - NIGHT

LATER Emmett lowers a weeping Carol to the ground The girl
rushes toward her fallen father and her mother who cradles
the body Hobart intercepts the girl trying to shield her
from the sight Emmetts eyes meet Hobarts Hobart lets
Carol go

Emmett walks through the devastation to where Hannah stands
dazed rifle still in hand Emmett puts his arm around her
She jumps at his touch then moves against him Jake rides
into the barnyard and up to Emmett He is flushed

JAKE
Theres two more out there walking
home if they can walk
Emmetts gaze is caught by something across the barnyard
Hannah follows his gaze

Mr Parker stumbles out of the darkness at the side of the
barn sobbing Hannah breaks from Emmett and rushes to Mr
Parker When she is beside him she freezes staring into
the shadows

Emmett watches
EXT ALLEYSTREET - SILVERADO - DAY

Augie is standing circus-style on the saddle of the pinto as
he rides down the alley As he approaches the main street
his foot slips and he bumps down hard into the saddle The
horse is barely in his control as he bounces out into the
busier thoroughfare and into the path of -- An imposing
phalanx of four horsemen Hoyt Scruffy SWANN and their
boss ETHAN MCKENDRICK The pinto shies as the horsemen pull
up abruptly

AUGIE
Sorry bout that

Swann looks with interest at the pinto then reaches out and
grabs the reins from Augies hand

AUGIE
Hey

SWANN
Whered you get this horse kid

AUGIE
This is my uncles horse

SWANN
The hell it is

MCKENDRICK
(irritable)
Whats the problem Swann

Emmett steps off the sidewalk on the other side of the street
and approaches the group his eyes on McKendrick

EMMETT
Yeah whats the problem

McKendrick turns at the sound of Emmetts voice Something
powerful flicks through his eyes but not too many people
would see it

MCKENDRICK
Emmett
EMMETT
McKendrick

Hoyt eyes Emmett who seems familiar Emmett looks at Swann
in such a way that Swann releases the reins of the pinto

MCKENDRICK
I didnt know you were out

EMMETT
Did it seem short to you

McKendrick reacts to Emmetts tone

MCKENDRICK
Thats all over as far as Im
concerned Emmett Im satisfied

EMMETT
Sounds good

MCKENDRICK
All right then
(to his men)
Lets go

SWANN
Mr McKendrick dont you recognize
that pinto

MCKENDRICK
(doesnt)
What

SWANN
Thats Lees horse

HOYT
Shut up Swann

Now McKendrick understands He avoids Emmetts gaze and speaks
to Swann

MCKENDRICK
Forget it

EMMETT
Wait a minute Get down off of there
Augie

Augie hops down as Emmett takes the reins Emmett gives Augie
a look and a small nod and the boy steps away

Emmett looks once again at the distinctive brand on the
pintos flank a circle with two wavy lines beneath it Now
he leads the pinto around beside McKendricks horse so he
can see the brand on that animal McKendrick has to twist in
his saddle to watch Emmett The brands are the same Emmett
looks up at McKendrick Things are clear between them

EMMETT
The man who lost this horse must
have been working for you I should
have known But you changed your
brand Ethan

McKendricks tone is different now --

MCKENDRICK
A lot of things changed when my father
died

Emmett lays the reins of the pinto across the front of
McKendricks saddle but they might just as well be a
gauntlet McKendrick picks them up He and his men move down
the street Emmett walks over and takes Augie beneath his
arm

DOWN THE STREET Hoyt rides close to McKendrick but looks
back over his shoulder

HOYT
Mr McKendrick he was one of them
last night at Bradleys

McKendrick reacts more bad news
INT LAND OFFICE - DAY

JT supervises the newly-arrived Settlers as they file their
homestead claims There is a battle-weary but resolved air

to the group after the night attack They are going to stick
it out The last step in the filing process is to sign ina
large register Mr Parker signs and moves away Hannah steps
up for her turn Her face is a little harder today but her
hand is steady

EXT LAND OFFICEHOLLIS HOUSE - DAY

Several of the Settlers wagons are here guarded by vigilant
armed men Their attitude has become more wary siege-like
Parker climbs onto a wagon Hannah is about to follow when
Emmett approaches with Augie who runs off around the house
Several of the Settlers greet Emmett warmly Emmett looks
closely at Hannahs face

EMMETT
Are you all right

HANNAH
This is a brutal land

EMMETT
You must have known that before you
She looks

HANNAH
Its one thing to know it

off then bitterly --

HANNAH

guns

EMMETT
Hows Mr Parker doing

HANNAH

INT SHERIFFS OFFICE - SILVERADO JAIL - DAY

MCKENDRICK

SHERIFF COBB

INT OFFICE - MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

Stella and Cobb have been dividing the receipts between them
Cobb puts another sum in a leather pouch

SHERIFF COBB
Thisll be for Paden

Stella is impressed by the amount Cobb notes her reaction

SHERIFF COBB
Its an advance We want him to know
hes going to be happy here

STELLA
I wouldnt worry about that

SHERIFF COBB
I thought you two would get along

Cobb opens the office door and holds it for Stella
INT SALOON - MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

Cobb and Stella come out into the saloon which is not yet
crowded Stella moves up her ramp behind the bar as Cobb
walks along in front of it

STELLA
From what Ive seen Paden doesnt
care much about money

SHERIFF COBB
He says he doesnt care about
anything but he does Theres just
no telling what its going to be

Slick is standing at the bar Cobb settles in next to him
They nod at each other

SHERIFF COBB
Howdy Mr Slick

SLICK
Sheriff

Cobb turns to Stella who has put a bottle before him and is
pouring Cobb and herself drinks Cobb seems to be including
Slick in the following story though he addresses Stella

SHERIFF COBB
Let me tell you about your friend
Paden Me and him and Tyree and a
few other boys did a good bit of
riding together a few years back
Business you know and business was
pretty good We were moving around a
lot the way you have to in that
work and somewhere along the line
we picked up this dog One of the
boys took to feeding it so it
followed us everywhere Anyway this
one time we were leaving a little
Missouri town in quite a hurry with
a bunch of the locals on our tails
The dog somehow got tangled up with
Tyrees horse and Tyree went flying
Tyree was pretty mad when he jumped
up so he shot the dog Didnt kill
him though Before you know it
Padens off his horse and holding
the dog Hed gone all strange on
us Said we should go on without
him I thought he was kidding at
first But he wasnt Tyree was ready
to plug em both And all this with
the posse coming down on us Here I
thought we were pals after all that
riding And suddenly hes more worried
about a mutt So we did like he asked
and left him He went to jail fora
dog

Stella has been listening intently Now her glance shifts
Paden has walked up beside Cobb Cobb lifts his glass to
Paden with a grin but speaks to Stella

SHERIFF COBB
And you want to hear the funny part
Paden didnt even like the damn dog

Paden gives Cobb an odd glance but smiles

PADEN
It evened out in the end They locked
me up but the dog sprung me

Cobb and Slick laugh but Stella just watches Paden

STELLA
Wheres the dog now

PADEN
He left me
Cobb takes the bottle and a couple glasses

SHERIFF COBB
Cmon Paden Ill buy you a drink

Cobb leads Paden to a table in the corner As Paden sits
down Cobb drops the pouch on the table Paden glances at
the contents as Cobb pours the drinks

SHERIFF COBB
I took out thirteen dollars

PADEN
This is a lot of money

SHERIFF COBB
I told you this was a sweet set-up

PADEN
It is that

SHERIFF COBB
Maybe you could run it without Stella

Paden looks sharply at Cobb With some heat --

PADEN

This is her life Ill go before she
does

Cobb is amused but not surprised

SHERIFF COBB
Easy boy Just an idea

PADEN
Well thanks but forget it

SHERIFF COBB
You know Paden what makes all this
work is me doing my job The fellows
you came to town with are causing
some trouble Its going to take a
little straightening out I have my
responsibilities I want you to
understand It has nothing to do
with us

Paden looks at Cobb a long time then at his drink

PADEN
What is it you want from me

SHERIFF COBB

Nothing Do nothing Dont get between
us
PADEN
Im a great believer in doing nothing

SHERIFF COBB
So we understand each other

PADEN
Dont worry about me If youre taking
on Emmett the last place I want to
be is between you

EXT ARROYO - OUTSIDE SILVERADO - DAY

We move along the burnished barrel of the old Henry 44 rifle
to Emmetts eye sighting along its length

Now we see his target In the distance is a small cactus
plant Emmett squeezes off a shot The cactus does not move
He aims again and fires quickly Again nothing at the cactus

AT THE CACTUS Now were right behind the target plant Emmett
in the distance When he fires a thin needle at the top

edge of the plant is blown away the bullet leaving a shallow
trough in the green skin He fires again and the next needle
disappears Now there are four troughs Hes been hitting

from the start

Emmett lowers the rifle walks back to his horse tied nearby
and leaves the rifle then moves away from the horse again

He stops looking at a can in the dust fifty feet away He
shakes the fingers of his gun hand once then very quickly

he draws his Colt and fires The can jumps into the air

While it is still moving Emmett holsters the gun releasing
it then draws again and fires As the can jumps once more
Emmett repeats the action Six times he draws The can doesnt
stop moving until after the last shot

The horrible NOISE echoes away as Emmett holds the empty gun
before him From behind a rock ahead of him Deputy Garth
appears

GARTH
Youre empty mister

Emmett immediately begins to bolt toward his horse A lasso
settles around his arms and whips him viciously backwards
In a second he is back on his feet and running like a bull
toward Deputy Kyle who has stepped from the brush to throw
the rope Immediately a second lasso catches Emmett from the
other side and pulls taut A deputy on horseback CHARLIE
has roped him Charlie and Kyle pull their ropes yanking
Emmett onto his back

Now appearing around a bend in the arroyo is Tyree a nasty
glint in his eye He rides hard directly toward Emmett Emmett
watches the pounding hooves approach He struggles but cant
move Tyrees horse thunders over him one hoof catching his
side with a sickening THUD Emmett writhes in agony

Tyree turns his horse and heads back Kyle pulls harder on
his rope Tyree rides over Emmett again but we cant see

the damage for the dust Tyree walks his horse over and looks
down as Garth Kyle and Charlie converge

Emmetts head is bleeding his body crumpled But he looks
up at them through pain-squinted eyes

GARTH
Aint you dead yet mister

TYREE
Cobb said hed be hard to kill

They all laugh at this

TYREE
(to Emmett)
Guess you couldnt hear us coming
(to the others)
He was practicing so hard for a fight
he missed the whole thing

The others cackle Garth draws his gun

GARTH
So long stranger

He starts to lower the muzzle toward Emmett There is the
echoing CRACK of a shot and the gun flies from Garths
shattered hand

Mal stands on a rock above them his rifle pointed

MAL
I dont want to kill you and you
dont want to be dead Drop your
guns

The other deputies exchange glances as Garth bends in pain

KYLE
He cant be that good Tyree

TYREE
Do you want to find out

CHARLIE
(dropping his rope)
I think we should do like he says

As the others start to unbuckle their holsters Charlie the
compliant one draws on Mal Mal shoots him out of the saddle
dead The others freeze
EXT TRAIL - BASE OF HILLS - DAY

Emmetts look makes it clear -- bad

EMMETT

understand)
Jake said you were out there I saw
him in town and he told me about

McKendricks men I wanted to see

EMMETT
Thats it

Mal looks at the rifle in his arms sadly

MAL
This was my fathers The men who
killed him took it

EMMETT

Emmett tries to move his pain-racked body

EMMETT
I gotta get to my brother If they
came after me theyll want him too

MAL
Youll never make it

EMMETT

Mal reaches out with a strong hand and eases Emmett back

street smoking a cigarette as he leans against a hitching
post Mal is peering at him uncertainly when the front door
of the Hollis house opens and Kate steps out onto the porch
The Cowboy steps quickly back into the shadows and Mal notes
it

Kate vigorously shakes a tablecloth over the railing and
turns back inside talking as she goes

KATE

She closes the door behind her Mal sees the cowboy called

BENEATH THE TABLE Raes left hand roves excitingly high on
Slicks thigh Now so smooth and quick we barely see it
her right hand lifts his trouser leg and slips the custom-
made dagger from his boot

Slick deals a hand Rae watches him thoughtfully The swinging
doors behind them crash open and a TOWNSMAN bursts in

TOWNSMAN
Fire The land office is on fire

Most of the patrons rush out including the players in Slicks
game who grab their chips first Slick peeks at one of the

thrown-down hands out of curiosity then rises slowly

SLICK
Shall we take a look

Rae nods and when she rises to take his arm her hands are
empty

EXT STREET IN FRONT OF HOLLIS HOUSE - NIGHT

The townspeople have formed a bucket brigade in a losing
battle with the fire at the Hollis house SHOUTS fill the
air above the ROAR of the inferno

Stella is among the new arrivals from the saloon She is
stopped by the sight of Kate bloody and hysterical being
borne away Horrified by the scene Stella now snaps out of
it and begins YELLING ORDERS to the saloon patrons to help
fight the blaze

Paden is only a few feet from the flames at the head of the
bucket line He is in shirt sleeves sweaty and sooty The
heat of the fire is driving the line back The Townsman next
to Paden yells to him --

TOWNSMAN
Theres no way Its a goner

Cobb Tyree and Kyle appear from the shadows Cobb takes in
the scene and spots JT being carried across the street He
motions Tyree over to investigate then moves toward the
fire

Slick and Rae arrive within the light of the blaze Slick
watches with detached interest but Raes gaze quickly locks
on Cobb moving through the chaos She sees him now with new
eyes

Phoebe crying watches as JTs limp body is hurried off
on a stretcher DR SKINNER in attendance She turns and is
face to face with Tyree who grasps her arms She regards
him with revulsion and fear then breaks from him and runs
off

Cobb moves up next to Paden

SHERIFF COBB
Give it up

Paden glances at him then throws more water on But now the
bucket line slows to a halt The townspeople fade back a
little to watch the inevitable

SHERIFF COBB
I hate to see this kind of thing in
my town

Paden glares at Cobb who is watching the fire

SHERIFF COBB
Im going to have to look into this

PADEN
Yeah maybe I will too

SHERIFF COBB
(looks at him)
I thought we talked about that

PADEN
We didnt talk about this
(a beat indignant)
They took the little boy Cobb

Paden moves off toward a nearby hitching post where he has
left his gunbelt and hat Cobb looks after him a moment
then follows They are now a short distance from the
onlookers Paden straps on his gunbelt but his eyes are on
Cobb as he approaches silhouetted against the flames
SHERIFF COBB
Youre still worried about the dog
arent you

Paden ties his holster to his thigh

SHERIFF COBB
You gotta calm down Paden Everything
will be put straight in a few days

PADEN
I saw how youre putting Mal Johnson
straight

Something flicks through Cobbs eyes He turns slowly and
looks at the scene behind him At the edge of the crowd a
tired Stella sits on an overturned bucket watching the fire
she wipes her sweaty brow with the sleeve of her dress Still
looking that way --

SHERIFF COBB
I never could count on you to be
reasonable
(turns back to Paden)
Dont force me to make an adjustment
around here

PADEN
Cobb youve got nothing I need

SHERIFF COBB
Im not thinking about your future
Paden Im worried about Stella

PADEN
Whats she got to do with it

SHERIFF COBB
Not a thing Shes just a mutual
friend
(a beat)
But if you wind up on the wrong side
of this shes going to get hurt

Paden stares at Cobb but now his eyes follow Cobbs right

hand which swings up to Padens shoulder

Cobb lets

SHERIFF COBB
Im just trying to save you from
yourself Dont change your luc

his hand drop and begins to move away
SHERIFF COBB

Get some sleep Paden Thingsl
look better tomorrow

Paden watches as Cobb walks over to Stella Cobb takes a
handkerchief from his pocket and squats before Stella He
starts to wipe her forehead solicitously but she takes the
handkerchief from his hand Cobb looks back at Paden as he
rises and moves off

Paden turns and looks into the leaping flames Our eyes can
barely discern the change as these flames dissolve into
others the fire now in --

INT CAVE - NIGHT

The low fire illuminates Emmett who is sitting on the hay

He is sweating badly and seems to be concentrating on some
rigorous task Now we see what it is -- to stand up He
struggles to his feet wincing in pain his hand steadying
against the rock When he is upright he tries to clear his
head and finally lets go of the wall For a moment he seems
all right Then suddenly he drops heavily back to the floor
The fall sends more pain shooting through his ribs Hes
going nowhere

killing a bottle of the good stuff Stella watches him pour
another drink
STELLA

Paden throws her a look as she takes one of the empty chairs

STELLA
What is it that I cant figure

PADEN
What do you mean

STELLA
Cobbs got something on you and it
must be pretty good

Paden is impressed even at this late date by her acuity

PADEN
What makes you say that

STELLA
If he didnt youd never sit still
while this was happening

PADEN
You sure Maybe thats the kind of
friend I am

STELLA

(laughs derisively)

(watches him take a

drink)
Cobb says theres no telling what
youre going to care about

PADEN
(bitterly amused)
Is that what he said Well he figured

She regards him as he looks at his glass Then he looks up
and for one moment their eyes meet Paden uncomfortable
quickly looks away In that second she understands her own
role in this And she is deeply moved They are silent
together

Mal and Rae look at each other

GARTH
She wanted to see you Course I had
to search her Im not sure I did a
good job Might have missed something
(holds up his bandaged
hand)
Only got one good hand you know

Rae steps toward Mal but Garth suddenly grabs her arm and
flings her back against the wall opposite Mals cell He
moves close to Rae and slips the big ring of keys over his
bandaged right hand freeing his left He looks once at Mal
then down Raes body His left hand fondles her

GARTH
Maybe I better check her a little
closer

Mals eyes flame as Garth takes Rae in a lascivious embrace
Suddenly Rae dips to one side within his arms Her hand comes
up from her boot with Slicks dagger and plunges it into
Garths back The deputy jolts back a few steps in shock
already pulling a six-gun from his belt with his left hand
He fires once into Raes body She goes down

Garth is cocking the gun again with weakening fingers when
Mals hand encircles his neck and pulls him violently back
against the bars Garths gun clatters away down the hall

free Mal tries again then hears the front door SLAM open

the hall

Down the line of bars Mals right arm is extended into the
corridor as it was when he released the knife

INT SALOON - MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

Paden is leaning all the way over the bar to extract a glass
from beneath it He straightens and walks back to the table
where Stella still sits Now however she has drawn her
legs up before her on the chair and is hugging her knees
deep in thought The saloon is now empty save for these two

Paden pours them each a drink and hands Stellas to her
This brings her back He clinks his glass with hers and toasts

PADEN
To my midnight star

They exchange a long look then drink

STELLA
Cobbs using me to stop you So good
people are being hurt because of me
(a beat)
That makes me mad

Listening closely he finds this last bit endearing

STELLA
Some people think because theyre
stronger -- or meaner -- they can

push you around Ive seen a lot of
that But its only true if you let
it be The world is what you make of

it

PADEN
I like your attitude But it can be
risky

STELLA

Im ready for that

There is a challenge in her eyes as she reaches out and slides
the whiskey bottle away from him

STELLA
How about you

PADEN
I dont want you to get hurt

STELLA
He cant hurt me if hes dead

Paden looks at her with growing appreciation A light is
coming back into his face A smile slowly grows on his lips
mirroring hers

The door behind the bar bangs open and Phoebe comes out
breathless

PHOEBE

INT SUPPLY ROOM - MIDNIGHT STAR - NIGHT

Phoebe leads them into the dimly-lit room and goes to her
knees beside Rae who lies wounded on the floor Rae is semi-

INT CAVE - NIGHT

Emmett works by the light of the fire checking one of the
guns taken from the deputies He hears something we do not
but continues to work for a few moments more Now we hear

it an approaching rider Emmett stands up gingerly and moves
painfully back into the shadows He is much improved but
still tentative

Mal comes into the cave carrying his Henry rifle Emmett
reappears lowering his gun

EMMETT
I didnt think you were going to
make it back

Mal steps into the light revealing his bruised face

MAL
I almost didnt
EMMETT
(reacts to Mals
condition)
Wheres Jake

MAL

Mal indicates that he doesnt know Emmett accepts that and
picks up his gunbelt

Her husband was shot I dont know
if hes going to make it

Emmett feels real pain

EMMETT
Kate

MAL
She was hurt pretty bad
(hates to tell him)
Emmett they took the little boy
with them

Emmett lets this all sink in And then his face and body
begin to transform All the pain is swept away in a surging
current of vengeful energy The MUSIC begins to build as
Emmett moves with eerie deliberateness to arm himself He
picks up one of the extra gunbelts and loops it over his
shoulder

Mal slides into his bandolier Emmett indicates the gunbelts
remaining on the floor

EMMETT
Want one of these

Mal turns He now holds his fathers Henry rifle in addition
to his own one awesome weapon in each hand

MAL
This oughta do

its head ears twitching A wave of restlessness goes through

toward the rise beyond the corrals Alarm creeps into his
face

AT THE BUNKHOUSE Swann his shoulder bandaged comes out to
join a Sentry Cowboy looking with concern at the rise
Suddenly the Sentry Cowboy starts running toward a saddled
horse nearby Red has jumped from the fence now too and
mounted up quickly The two horsemen head off toward the
rise at a gallop

Swann looks in alarm at --

THE CREST OF THE RISE Pouring into view with a ground-shaking
RUMBLE is a huge herd of stampeding cattle

trying to turn the herd

horses Scruffys horse rears and breaks away from him

from the cloud there are answering shots The Sentry Cowboy
is shot dead off his horse

Emerging like a spirit from the dust at the edge of the herd
comes Emmett six-gun in hand

On the other side of the herd Padens form materializes He
aims his Winchester and fires Reds horse rears Red goes
down and the herd pounds over him

gunbelt He looks at the on-rushing stampede then toward

the corral where several Cowboys are swinging up on their
horses Suddenly there is gunfire from the roof of the
bunkhouse above Hoyt One of the Cowboys in the corral goes
down Another draws his gun and lifts it toward the bunkhouse
but is shot before he can fire The other Cowboys head for
cover Hoyt stops some men who are coming out the door behind
him and edges out to try to locate the source of the fire

runs to the corner of the veranda nearest the rise He takes
in the stampede which is almost upon them now then hears
gunfire to his right He looks back there and sees Mal on

of the raised rim Now Mal swings his rifle around toward

holding pens are destroyed horses run free and Cowboys
scramble away from the deadly current of rampaging cattle

Scruffy sneaks in the back door of the barn He peeks around
the wall of a stall at Padens unprotected back When he
sees Paden stop to reload his Colt Scruffy steps out and
aims at him

Quite unexpectedly someone swings down from the loft above
kicking Scruffy and sending him flying into the recess of a
stall Now the figure drops into view Its Jake He dives
after Scruffy

Paden reloaded now and unaware of the struggle behind him
has to shrink back from a splintering rail Now he hears two
muffled shots from the back of the barn He looks over there
After a beat Jake steps into Padens view grinning like a
maniac and happily buckling his reacquired gunbelt Paden
does a double take Jake gives him a big Here I am gesture
then indicates hes going up to the loft again to help out
with the guys up front But first with real relish he checks

and shoots one spins and shoots the other

The third Cowboy turns to look His mistake Paden flies
into view and shoots him dead

bruise where the rope was around his neck When he speaks
it is in a hoarse whisper --

bunkhouse catty-corner from Mals position

Paden squeezes off a shot but Hoyt has already disappeared
from view Paden looks along the bunkhouse where he can see
Mal firing Mal is protected at present from Hoyt by the big
chimney he is braced against But if he isnt warned Hoyt
will surprise him A Cowboy in the bunkhouse spots Paden and
fires at him Paden must warn Mal quickly Yelling is hopeless
in the din Paden aims carefully at Mal and fires

AT MAL The chimney is hit just above Mals head He swings
his rifle around toward -- Paden Paden signals wildly about
Hoyt Mal understands just in time he flops around the
chimney just as Hoyt gets a bead on him Without knowing it
Mal avenges his fathers murder Hoyt is blown off the roof

The bulk of the herd has passed but confused cattle are
everywhere

AT THE VERANDA Jake has ridden across the open area under

EXT ALLEY NEAR STORAGE SHED - DAY

Slick runs past the shed door and peers between buildings in
search of Stella Shes gone He comes back to the shed

Before opening the door he does an odd thing he chops his
left forearm sharply downward and a shiny derringer slides
crisply into his grip from beneath his sleeve He enters
cautiously

INT STORAGE SHED - DAY

Slick moves through the dim light He hears a MOAN and steps
forward He looks down at Rae Half-delirious she focuses

on him and reacts in terror He makes the derringer disappear
and kneels beside her

SLICK
Dont be afraid baby Ill stay
with you until your little friend
comes back

EXT STREET NEAR MIDNIGHT STAR - DAY

Jake comes riding down the street waving his hat WHOOPING
and HOLLERING The few remaining pedestrians run for cover
at the sight

JAKE
(yelling)
Come on out boys Jakes in town
Lets start the ball

EXT MIDNIGHT STAR - DAY

Jake jumps off the pinto and hitches it in front of the
saloon As he approaches the entrance set in the cut-off
corner of the building he executes a fast pirouette scanning
down all four blocks that meet here He finds the doors locked
and kicks them open with a loud BANG He goes inside

EXT SIDE STREET - DAY
Tyree has heard the commotion and moves toward it
EXT DOCTORS OFFICE - DAY

Stella is pounding on the door without luck She gives up
looks around and hurries off

EXT MIDNIGHT STAR - DAY

Tyree stops across the street from the Midnight Star and
looks at Jakes horse and the open doors Across the
intersection Kyle appears at a run Tyree motions him to go
around the back of the saloon Tyree runs across the street
When he is on the porch of the saloon he pulls his gun and
begins edging toward the open doors

INT SALOON - MIDNIGHT STAR - DAY
Its dark in here with the shutters closed Tyree jumps

inside gun poised When Kyle bangs through from the back
Tyree almost shoots him They scan the room and advance
cautiously into the shadows Nobody here Now they back out
eyeing the dark stairwell

When they are safely on the porch Tyree motions for Kyle to
go down one side of the building while he starts down the
other

Jake appears from beneath Stellas ramp behind the bar and
vaults lightly over the bar In a moment he stands just inside
the open doorway He peeks out then turns so his back is to
the outside his guns still holstered

EXT MIDNIGHT STAR - DAY

Jake backs quietly out onto the porch When he stops he can
see both Tyree and Kyle moving along their respective porches

JAKE
Hey

Tyree and Kyle spin at the sound Only then does Jake draw
both guns and pointing them in two completely different
directions he shoots both men at once

INT STORAGE SHED - DAY

Slick has made himself comfortable next to Rae who has fallen
into a fitful sleep Now he hears something The door of the
shed opens and closes He waits confidently for Stella to
appear around the intervening wall of barrels and crates

But hes looking too low Mal steps into view the big Henry
rifle in his hand Slicks eyes widen but he gets control
quickly and rises trying to gauge Mals attitude

Mal looks from Rae to Slick and back to Rae

SLICK
Im glad youre here Mal Ive been
watching her but she needs a doctor

MAL
Yeah

He looks at Slick as he leans his rifle against the wall
Slick looks at the rifle then at Mal Mal seems to
concentrate on Rae and makes a move that way When he is
past Slick Slick makes the peculiar chopping gesture of
his left forearm that snaps the derringer into his hand

Mal has been waiting for something and is already turning
into Slick Before Slick can raise his gun hand Mal has
Slicks wrist in a vise-like grip Mals other arm encircles
Slicks torso and crushes him against Mals body Two strong
men strain against each other

The cocked derringer wavers perilously toward the sleeping
Rae Suddenly Mal twists Slick around banging his hand
into the wall and the derringer fires Slick lets it clatter
to the floor

Rae wakes with a start and watches the combatants in terror

The mens eyes are only inches apart Something flashes
through Mals and he loosens his embrace Instantly Slick
dips to the right lifting his boot to his hand But his
dagger is not there

Slicks surprised look is answered by Mals tight grin

MAL
Looking for this

Their bodies jerk as Slick gets his last surprise and goes
limp in Mals arms He falls to the floor his own boot dagger
protruding from his ribcage

Mal kneels to embrace his sister
EXT STREETS ON FRINGE OF SILVERADO - DAY

Emmett rides slowly down the street his Winchester held
ready on his thigh His eyes continually scan the buildings
and alleyways He slowly rounds a corner

Way behind him off his right shoulder McKendrick has brought
his horse to a stop between two buildings and is carefully
aiming at Emmetts back with his Winchester Now he pulls

the hammer back with a CLICK

Emmett hears it and twists in the saddle as McKendrick fires
The shot is good but Emmetts Winchester takes the hit and
jumps in his hand He levels it at McKendrick cocks the
hammer and squeezes the trigger Nothing He tries to work
the lever as McKendrick fires again Emmetts rifle is
useless He throws it away and draws his Colt firing twice

Emmetts bullets hit close to McKendrick His horse shies
McKendrick turns his horse and rides behind a building

SERIES OF SHOTS Emmett chases after McKendrick along a
parallel street Each man prepares to fire as they reach the
intermittent spaces between buildings McKendrick gets a
clear shot and fires twice Emmett rides around a building
and speeds toward McKendricks path He comes into the open
ready to fire but McKendrick is heading off down an alley
Rather than follow Emmett moves to cut him off

EXT EDGE OF SILVERADO - DAY

McKendrick has pulled up behind a barn When Emmett comes
into view McKendrick fires twice then spurs his horse back
into town Emmett squeezes off one carefully aimed shot
just missing McKendrick before he disappears
EXT BOOT HILL - DAY

The echoes of gunfire reach the little boy waiting at the
cemetery Augie watches and wonders

EXT HOTEL STREET - DAY

McKendrick comes out of an alley and tears toward the
intersection which Dusty commands from the roof of the hotel
porch McKendrick waves his rifle at Dusty and rounds the
corner of the hotel

Now Emmett comes out of the alley in pursuit He slows a bit
since McKendrick is no longer in sight As he moves down the
block toward the hotel intersection he looks into the loading
yard of the feed warehouse which forms a cul-de-sac on his
left

Now Dusty opens fire from the protection of the hotel sign
Bullets kick up dirt around Emmett but instead of retreating
he slings himself Indian-fashion down along the protected
side of his horse and rides toward the sign

Emmett aims over the mane and fires once twice through
the sign Dusty rises hit and Emmett kills him with a third
shot Dusty crashes through the sign to fall to the street

Emmett has just straightened in his saddle and snapped open
the loading gate of his empty Colt when McKendrick opens up
from where he has reappeared down the street Emmett is hit
in the thigh

For one long second there is perfect clarity between the
men Emmetts eyes stare from his pain-contorted countenance
at his adversary McKendrick hesitates only a breath to look
at Emmett before raising the rifle and charging

Emmett wheels his horse and painfully spurs it back down the
block As McKendricks fire hits around him Emmett turns
into the nearest cover -- the loading yard of the feed
warehouse

McKendrick rides toward the mouth of the loading yard with
all hes got He cant let Emmett reload The glint of victory
is in his eyes as he draws near the loading yard

He raises his rifle in preparation for the coming clear shot
at his trapped enemy As his horse begins to pass in front
of the loading yard we hear a terrible RUMBLE OF HOOFBEATS
on wood McKendricks expression changes to horror

Emmett has ridden onto the loading dock of the warehouse and
charged toward this end Now he jumps his horse straight out
into the air over McKendricks horse The hooves of Emmetts
horse catch McKendrick full force with a HORRIBLE SOUND
Emmetts horse lands on its feet but just barely From a
cloud of dust Emmett watches McKendricks horse race on
riderless Its master is a still shape in the dirt

EXT STREET - DAY

Stella has been hurrying through the empty streets Now she
pauses to listen to the new silence

EXT SHERIFFS OFFICE - DAY

Cobb listens too He sits on the steps at the front of his
office toying with an object in his hands Now he brings it
to his mouth It is his sheriffs badge and he breathes a
fog onto it then polishes it on his sleeve He looks at it
another moment smiles to himself then pins it on his chest

EXT STREETS NEAR SHERIFFS OFFICE - DAY

Paden is walking He is calm He rounds a corner and moves
out into the center of the new street

AT THE END OF THE STREET Cobb looks up from his seat and
sees Paden coming toward him He had a feeling it would be
this way It makes him sad He stands up and walks to the
center of the street

Paden keeps coming He watches Cobb resigned Now Paden
stops

Stella comes out of an alley When she takes in the scene
she steps onto the sidewalk and puts her hand on a post She
looks back and forth between the men

Cobb sees her but his only real concern is Paden Paden
sees her too His gaze returns to Cobb

SHERIFF COBB
What a waste This could have been

such a sweet deal for us

PADEN
Yeah Bad luck
(a beat)
Good-bye Cobb

SHERIFF COBB
Good-bye Paden

They both draw and its impossible to say who moved first
But one is luckier Paden stands as Cobb falls

Paden holsters his gun as though it weighed a hundred pounds
CUT TO BLACK

SLOW FADE-UP over the SOUNDS of tinkling glasses piano music
and friendly voices
INT SALOON - MIDNIGHT STAR - MORNING

Four shot glasses sparkle in a line on the bar A bottle of
the good stuff is used to fill them

Stella is pouring the drinks from behind the bar Now the
glasses are lifted by Mal Jake Paden and Emmett Stella
holds up the bottle and proposes a toast --

STELLA
To California

They echo her and clink glasses Stella clinks with the
bottle When they toss back their drinks she tips the bottle
to her lips then puts it down on the bar as the four glasses
come down

EMMETT
Gotta go

MAL
Right

The four men move toward the door as Stella walks down her
ramp Emmett walks with a slight limp

EXT MIDNIGHT STAR - MORNING

Phoebe stands on the porch talking across to Rae much

recovered who sits on the seat of a wagon heavily loaded
with farming supplies Rae wears a simple dress and looks
quite different

The men come out onto the porch Emmett shakes Mals hand
and watches him climb onto the wagon Mal gets the wagon
going and the other wave

Jake has slipped his arm around Phoebes waist Now he turns
her into his arms for a big kiss

Emmett is watching Mal and Rae roll away when a womans hand
touches his back He turns to find Hannah looking up at him
Paden watches from nearby

HANNAH
Werent you going to come out to say
good-bye

EMMETT

HANNAH
This time youre really going
(he nods)

You know where Ill be
EMMETT

They look at each other She kisses him and steps back When
Emmett looks up from her Paden is watching him with an amused
look The two men shake hands Emmett and Jake mount up

JAKE
So long Paden

Paden gives him a nod Kate and Augie roll up in a buggy In
the back seat a blanket across his legs sits JT They

wait for the brothers Augie drives for his recovering mother
Stella comes out and stands by Phoebe

Hannah is now standing next to Paden Emmett looks at them
as though they were a couple

EMMETT
(to Paden)
You might make a farmer yet

PADEN
Ive got a job

He puts his arm against the post and his coat is drawn back
to reveal the shiny sheriffs badge on his vest

Emmett touches the brim of his hat and turns his horse away
He and Jake flank the buggy and head off

EXT OUTSIDE OF TOWN - MORNING

Emmett and Jake take turns leaning down from their saddles
to kiss Kate and Augie and shake hands with JT

EMMETT
(to Augie)

Take care of your folks

One final look and theyre off Jake turns in the saddle
only once --

JAKE
Well be back

They spur their horses forward chasing their shadows heading
west
