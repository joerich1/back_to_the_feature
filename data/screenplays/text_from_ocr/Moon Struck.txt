She remembers that it was going While she looks it
up Then small jets of water begin to appear Then

multiplication table Except
sometimes Sometimes Im droning
along and I look up and theres
this fresh young beautiful face and
its all new to her and Im this
great guy whos just brilliant and
thinks out loud And when that
happens when I look out among those
chairs and look at a young womans
face and see me there in her eyes
me the way I always wanted to be and
maybe once was then I ask her out
on a date It doesnt last It can
go for a few weeks or a couple of
precious months but then she catches
on that Im just a burnt out old
gasbag and that shes as fresh and
bright and full of promise as
moonlight in a martini And at that
moment she stands up and throws a
glass of water in my face or some
action to that effect

wrong idea in his head Listen
Johnny theres a question I want to
ask you And I want you to tell me
the truth if you can Why do men
chase women

MR JOHNNY
Well Theres the Bible story God
took a rib from Adam and made Eve
Maybe men chase women to get the rib
back When God took the rib he left
a hole there place where there used
to be something and the women have
that Maybe a man isnt complete as
a man without a woman

ROSE
But why would a man need more than
one woman

MR JOHNNY
I dont know Maybe because he fears
death

Rose leaps up very excited

ROSE
Thats it Thats the reason

I dont know

No thats really it Thank you for
