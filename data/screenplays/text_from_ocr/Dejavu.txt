RISE UP TO REVEAL

EXT ORIENT POINT FERRY DOCK - DAY

Fourth of July weekend The dock crammed with PEOPLE AND
VEHICLES -- rows of cars RVs and trucks in line to board

Then from somewhere forward a CAR RADIO starts --

RADIO DEEJAY (VO)
(filtered)
Its ten forty-eight on Endless Summer
Sunday now lets go back in time
to 1964 and the Beach Boys On Long
Islands 98 FM

The opening chords of the Beach Boys ‘Dont Worry Baby

The Ferry Worker looks annoyed -- some idiot is going to have
a dead battery He walks toward the sound
A WHITE FORD EXPLORER sits parked on the second level hull
ramp its RADIO BLARING as the worker approaches
THE BEACH BOYS (VO)
(filtered)

Well its been building up inside of

Somethins bound to go wrong

The Worker cups his hands over his eyes peers into the
passenger window -- thats weird --

No keys in the ignition

He walks around the back checks the license number frowns --
The plates been removed

Weirder He glances in through the back window --

FOUR ORANGE BARRELS inside He ponders that for a moment

Because a moment is all he has

motionless amid the chaos indifferent to the rain Mid-
thirties a cold intelligence Dougs eyes miss nothing

TWO POLICE DOGS led by detectives sniff at a broken
scorched life-preserver --

Dougs eyes shift

AMBULANCE WORKERS stand ready but with nothing to do
helpless --

Doug registers this eyes moving on

A pair of COAST GUARD CREWMEN try to console a group of NAVY
CADETS several of whom are in tears
Doug looks past the Cadets -- near the dock a SHELL-SHOCKED
WOMAN is standing alone looking lost as the chaos swirls
around her

Doug notices -- a WHITE SATELLITE VAN creeps along comes to

The sudden muffled sound of a CELL PHONE Both men turn --

Theyre standing near a LINE OF BODIES laid out by
paramedics The cell phone RINGS AGAIN inside one of the
body bags Never to be answered

Doug stares at it Then he turns away back toward his car
Pryzwarra stares at the body bag cell phone still RINGING

of high-tech night-vision style goggles from his backpack

At approximately 1050 this morning
the passenger ferry Sea Bride exploded
in the waters of Long Island Sound
seven miles southwest of New London
Connecticut Early estimates place the
number of casualties at eight hundred
and forty-three men women and
children

Shock and anger from those present Doug enters at the back
unnoticed and unimportant Standing room only he looks over
the shoulders of two taller agents to see --

McCREADY
Men ladies -- this happened on July
Fourth The Sea Bride was carrying
servicemen and their families to a
special event at Groton Sub Base We
consider this a deliberate act of
terrorism against the United States
Navy The President concurs with our
assessment

McCready shuffles to a new piece of paper --

McCREADY
Uh Im also told that someone
claiming to be a Federal Agent stole
an ambulance out of Brookhaven Medical
last night So whoever took it just
leave the keys on my desk and
therell be no questions asked

Polite laughter from the room Nice try boss
McCREADY
Folks this is a perfect act of
terrorism There were no baggage
checks no flight data recorders

evidence is under 90 feet of seawater
Dont overlook anything

DOUG
Which ME

INT SUFFOLK COUNTY MEDICAL - AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY

Sterile metal white The MEDICAL EXAMINER leans over an
autopsy table eyes closed almost in prayer He whispers to
the form under the sheet

ME
My name is Doctor Philip Vavala
Tell me

That ritual observed he gently pulls the sheet away --

-- revealing the CHARRED BLUE BODY of a young WOMAN wearing
what used to be a pretty summer dress She stares up at us --
cold angelic dead

Doug stares at her standing a few feet back The ME
gestures him closer as if to say ‘come take a look

Doug moves to the womans side -- suddenly she turns to look
straight into his eyes The ME has rolled her head to one
side

ME (CONT’D)
(into a hanging mike)
This is the body of an adult female
Caucasian in her late twenties or
early thirties Weight of the body is
78 pounds resident 64 inches in
length

Doug stares at the dead womans face entranced

Her eyes are lifeless skin pallid lips bluer than ice
Under the circumstances she cant possibly be beautiful --
but she once was The kind of beauty that grows on you

ME (CONTD)
Immediately evident is heavy focal
charring of the limbs and torso
anterior chest face and neck are
intact though swollen from apparent
immersion in seawater

The ME glances along the womans arm down to her hands
Frowns Picks up a Polaroid camera Indicates to Doug --

ME (CONTD)
Would you hold that up for me please

Doug blinks -- who me He gingerly takes the womans
blackened hand lifts it off the table

As the ME aims the camera Doug looks down at the hand
resting in his owns

All five fingers have been sheared away leaving ragged
stumps

Doug looks away Several FLASHES as the ME snaps photos

ME (CONTD)
Each digit of the left hand has been
severed between the middle and distal
phalanges -- angle of shearing
indicates a single sharp force trauma
possibly caused by shrapnel

Doug looks back to the womans face He notices a SINGLE BLUE
PEARL EARRING in one ear He glances at her other ear --
pierced but empty

ME (0S) (CONTD)
posterior charring gives off a
strong diesel odor suggesting
perimortem immersion in burning fuel

An odd hypnotic look comes over Doug -- almost as if he
knows her He brings his hand up to the Womans face
until the tips of his fingers rest softly on her lips

ME
What are you doing

Doug doesnt seem to hear He brings his fingers off the
womans mouth -- her lips stick lightly to his fingertips

ME (CONTD)
What are you doing

DOUG
Do you have a UV gun

ME
Second shelf behind you

Doug goes to the shelf Intrigued now the ME moves to the
head of the table turns off the overhead lamp

Doug brings a hand-held ULTRAVIOLET GUN to the table Aims it
at the womans face pulls the trigger --

-- illuminating a WIDE BAND OF CHEMICAL RESIDUE across her
mouth and cheeks glowing like yellow neon The shape is a
perfect rectangle

ME (CONTD)
Duct tape

Doug nods They stare at the dead girls mouth

DOUG
Whats that stippling see that

He points within the band of tape residue numerous TRACE
PARTICLES stand out under the light like tiny stars The ME
brings the magnifying lamp over leans in for a closer look --

ME
Adhesive probably retained some
substance against the seawater --

The womans eyes suddenly sparkle light spills across the
body from an OPEN DOOR A LOCAL COP steps in --

LOCAL COP
We may have a name Missing Persons
has a Claire Kuchever reported
missing this morning when she didnt
pick up her parents at JFK The
reports being faxed

Doug nods Turns back to the body

DOUG
Claire

No answer of course

DOUG (CONTD)
Doctor I want you to perform a full
autopsy Pretend you never heard about
a ferry explosion -- concentrate on
time and cause full spread of lab
tests everything

ME
Absolutely

Doug picks up the Polaroid camera centers it on the womans
face He hesitates looks at her almost apologetically

Then aims the camera again holds it there A FLASH --
EXT HOUSE - EVENING

Wood porch nice lawn mailbox by the fence The rain has
become a constant drizzle a grey tarp over the scene

Doug sits in his car looking out at the house reluctant
INT PARENTS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

A SHRIEK of pure grief CLAIRES MOTHER is crying
hysterically CLAIRES FATHER rocks and hushes her weeping
himself They cling to each other on the couch

On the coffee table in front of them rests the Polaroid photo
of their daughter dead on an autopsy table

Doug picks up the photograph waits quietly as Claires
parents try to cope

CLAIRES MOTHER
OH GOD I was so mean to her on the
phone Oh Claire Im sor-ry

CLAIRES FATHER
No-no-no shh shhhh

CLAIRES MOTHER
It cant be It cant It cant

Doug looks away uncomfortable focusing on the decor His
gaze comes to rest on several framed photographs on the
mantle He notices one in particular --

A PHOTO of a young woman CLAIRE KUCHEVER Pretty hair a
beautiful smile The kind of beauty that grows on you

CLAIRES FATHER
(realizing)
The ferry disaster She was on the
ferry Oh God

DOUG
We dont know yet sir But anything

CLAIRES FATHER
(barely hanging on)
I dont know she -- she was supposed

gone we thought maybe she sold it --
shed been trying to for awhile --

DOUG
She lives alone

CLAIRES FATHER
Yes -- her fiancé broke up with her in
March She wanted kids but he didnt

CLAIRES MOTHER
(barely audible)

DOUG

CLAIRES FATHER

Doug nods mental note made
CLAIRES MOTHER

her giving what comfort he can

DOUG

profoundly uncomfortable Finally

DOUG (CONTD)

Doug comes through the door -- suddenly Claires father
reaches for his arm

CLAIRES FATHER

Christmas cards She loved Cary Grant
movies She used to dance with her cat

can guess why

(a plea)
I know how these things go but please
- I need her to matter to you

Doug blinks motionless Claires Father hands him a
photograph -- the one from the mantle -- and a set of keys

Doug looks at them A wail of anguish from inside and Doug
looks up -- and meets the eyes of Claires Father

The door closes

EXT CLAIRES HOUSE - CAR - EVENING

windshield out at a tree-lined street a quaint one-story

house The driveway is empty

Doug pulls a pair of plastic gloves out of his pocket and
gets out of his car approaches the house

INT CLATRES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

A key turning in the lock Doug pushes the door lets it open
and looks into the house not stepping inside

There as if to greet him standing in the center of a
carpet is a CAT with black and white fur

DOUG
Hello Ginger

The cat steps forward then suddenly leaps up into Dougs
arms he has no choice but to catch it

Doug is startled a moment not sure what to do Then shrugs
steps inside scratching the cats head He looks around --

The decor is feminine inviting furnished with antiques
thoughtfully rescued from thrift shops and farmers markets

Doug sees an ANSWERING MACHINE by the door light blinking
He sets the cat down pulls a pen from his pocket uses it to
press PLAY Walks through the room as the TAPE REWINDS

A CRANE lifts a submerged CAR from the sea --

EXT CALVERTON HANGAR - TARMAC - NIGHT

TELEVISION NEWS CREWS make their reports from a long row of
satellite vans A troop truck carrying NAVY DIVE TEAM members
rolls past the giant hangar --

hesitating for some reason He takes a deep breath -- once
twice -- then holds it and opens the door into --

INT CALVERTON HANGAR - NIGHT

A cavernous makeshift morgue

ROWS AND ROWS OF BODY BAGS lie across the floor awaiting
identification more are being laid out by FBI FORENSICS
TEAMS A harvest of death under black plastic

Doug marches past them past a handful of POLICE and FAMILY
MEMBERS moving among the bodies down the long center aisle

He passes a PERSONAL EFFECTS AREA shredded backpacks soaked
purses a childs blackened sneakers He never breaks stride
doesnt look keeps moving toward --

INT HANGAR - RECONSTRUCTION AREA - NIGHT
FBI CREWS and NTSB INVESTIGATORS have begun to reconstruct

the ferry from recovered debris A flatbed truck backs up
bearing A HUGE SLICE OF HULL like a giant ragged melon rind

At a long table several AGENTS -- McCready and Pryzwarra
among them -- are gathered around a collection of small
pieces of metal none bigger than a quarter

AGENT STALHUTH
» our early guess is that the bomb
vehicle was a minivan or SUV Possibly
white or silver --

MCCREADY
Make and model

STALHUTH
No way to tell yet

BROOKS (0S)
Hey I got a partial on the license
plate

All eyes turn to AGENT BROOKS -- he holds up a tiny sliver of
metal with a pair of tweezers and smirks

A few tired groans at the gallows humor McCready turns back
to Stalhuth

MCCREADY
How long

Stalhuth looks over the debris

STALHUTH
Could be weeks Months

MCCREADY
Check all SUVs and minivans registered
in the state anything recently rented
or purchased anything tied to a theft
or missing persons report --

DOUG (0S)
Agent McCready

McCready turns -- Doug is there

DOUG
Im Agent Carlin LIRA Evidence
Recovery --

MCCREADY
(cold)
Douglas Carlin I remember you Flight
800 investigation

The other agents look up at that Doug blanches stands his
ground Pryzwarra wonders at their reaction steps forward

PRYZWARRA (CONTD)
Hello Doug You have something

Doug stares at the others then to Pryzwarra

DOUG
This afternoon I witnessed the autopsy
of a young woman who washed up off
Plum Island with heavy fuel burns and
traces of thermite powder on her face
She’d also lost several fingers in
what appeared to be blast damage

McCready catches the slight inflection

MCCREADY
Appeared

DOUG
When I checked the tide tables against
the position of the blast sir
this woman was killed at least two
hours before the ferry exploded

DENNY (0S)
Before

Doug turns to see a civilian approaching the table ALEXANDER
DENNY Black T-shirt tennis shoes long wispy hair Standing
with the agents in their suits he looks like a crazed genius
scientist or an aging rock star

DENNY (CONTD)
You say she died before the explosion

Doug blinks -- who is this guy -- then

DOUG
Her name is Claire Kuchever Her body
washed up before the explosion and
against the tide

Doug has everyones attention now McCready is dubious
stares at him

PRYZWARRA
You have a scenario

DOUG
I believe someone abducted her from
her home taped her mouth and wrists

then severed her fingers -- probably
because she had his DNA under her
nails

(MORE)

DOUG (contd)
Then he burned her alive and dumped
her into the Sound where she would
appear to be just another disaster
victim --

DENNY
A disaster that hadnt happened yet

STALHUTH
(to Doug)
You refer to the killer as ‘he
Why not they

DOUG
I work Evidence Recovery as needed My
main field is victimology I believe
were looking for a lone individual
most likely a paranoid sociopath No
group has claimed responsibility

Pryzwarra shakes his head no

MCCREADY
Why this woman

DOUG
Her SUV is missing It could have been
stolen to drive the bomb onto the
ferry
(checks his file)
New York license CHB 4470 A white
Ford Explorer

The agents look down at the pieces then at each other --
yeah that fits Doug holds out his report to McCready

DOUG (CONTD)
Something else The victim placed a
call to the Long Island field office
the night before she was killed

Dennys eyebrows go up at this McCready takes the report

MCCREADY
Thank you Well look into it
(Doug stands there)
Thank you

Doug has been dismissed He turns walks away and notices
for the first time a row of cars parked against the far wall
Doug stops and calls back --

DOUG
Hey wheres Minuti

PRYZWARRA
What

Doug indicates a particular car parked down the line blue
early model BMW Boston Red Sox cap visible through the back
window A bumper sticker WHITE CANE POST 56

DOUG
My partner Larry Minuti Thats his
car
Pryzwarra looks then closes his eyes in an ‘aw fuck

expression Even McCready looks solemn

MCCREADY
Agent Carlin those cars were
brought here from the ferry parking
lot Vehicles that remain unclaimed
(a beat)
Im sorry

Doug stares at McCready as realization sinks in He looks at
the other agents none of them can meet his eyes

Doug turns Walks away between the rows of bodies
Denny watches him leave thoughtful

DENNY

EXT CALVERTON HANGAR - DAY

Doug leans on the drivers side window of his car head down
not moving In the glass the distorted reflection of an ARMY
HELICOPTER moves past Doug closes his eyes

MP (0S)
Agent Carlin

Doug opens his eyes Reflected in the glass are now the
distorted shapes of two MILITARY POLICE OFFICERS

Doug turns One is tall and muscular The other short and
even more muscular

MP (CONTD)
Would you come with us please

Doug regards them Theyre serious there to do a job

DOUG
I have a choice

The MP cracks a smile
MP

As a matter of fact sir no you
dont

INT HOLDING ROOM - DAY

Doug sits in a straight-back chair in front of an empty desk
Looks like hes been there a while

The room is dominated on one side by a long TWO-WAY MIRROR
Doug stares at it The mirror seems to stare back

The door opens Pryzwarra enters sits down

PRYZWARRA
Id guess youve got some questions

DOUG
For me to have questions first Id
have to know something

Pryzwarra grins

PRYZWARRA
Ive been put in charge of a newly
created special investigative unit
Our first case is the ferry bombing I
want you on the team

DOUG
Why me

PRYZWARRA
You know the area We need someone
local who also has the proper
security clearance

Doug nods at the two-way mirror

DOUG
Thats what you told the people back
there Why me

Pryzwarra smiles leans forward

PRYZWARRA
Im a good field agent But this
investigation has unique
requirements We need someone who can
take exactly one look at a crime scene
and tell us whats wrong whats
missing what we can ignore and what
we should pursue

Doug frowns The mirror is still a strong silent presence
Pryzwarra lowers his voice

PRYZWARRA (CONTD)
They wont say it but you impressed
the hell out of somebody

DOUG

They told you my history
PRYZWARRA

Im not worried about that

(beat)
Cant change the past right

EXT ARMY HELICOPTER - IN FLIGHT - MORNING

Streaking over miles of thick forest crossing the Long
Island Pine Barrens

INT HELICOPTER

DOUG stares out the window seated between two MPs silent
Pryzwarra sits across from him Suddenly

PRYZWARRA
Youre gonna need this

He hands Doug a CARDKEY bearing Dougs name and photo
Doug regards the logo
DOUG
Brookhaven home of the big

particle collider

PRYZWARRA
Thats the one

Pryzwarra points -- Doug looks out the window

EXT RHIC - DAY - ESTABLISHING

The chopper streaks over a wooded rise TO REVEAL -- the
RELATIVISTIC HEAVY ION COLLIDER a massive two-mile ring
carved out of the Long Island Pine Barrens So vast its

literally visible from space

DOUG
Okay now I do have some questions

INT HUMVEE - MOVING - DAY
Doug glances outside The HumVee rolls past a guarded
checkpoint onto what looks like a college campus Stately

brick buildings amidst stately oak trees

A Brookhaven satellite van the same he saw arrive in the
rain at the disaster site passes by in the other direction

Doug takes note of the van stares ahead thoughtful --

INT BROOKHAVEN - RHIC MAGNET STATION - DAY

Pryzwarra leads Doug toward a three-story MAGNET ARRAY where
a group of ENGINEERS is making last-minute adjustments under
Dennys direction Denny turns at their approach

PRYZWARRA
Doug this is Dr Alexander Denny

DENNY
Charmed Were about to open the
Window hurry up
Denny swipes his cardkey through A SEALED SECURITY DOOR --
INT RHIC CORRIDOR

Doug Pryzwarra and Denny walk down a curved cement corridor
They duck under an air duct and some wiring

DOUG
What is it thats special about your
special team
PRYZWARRA
Really itll be easier to show you
than to tell you
Pryzwarra stops at an unmarked door He cant help but smile

PRYZWARRA (CONTD)
Get ready for the world to change

He opens the door --

Revealing a JANITORS CLOSET Doug glances in at the dusty
cleaning supplies

PRYZWARRA (CONTD)

Uh -- wrong door
DENNY
(amused)
This way --

Doug and Pryzwarra follow Denny around the ring to a second
door it looks very much like the first Denny pulls it open
There is a slight WHOOSH as the seal is broken --

INT BROOKHAVEN - MAIN LAB - DAY

Doug steps through Revealed before him is --

THE TIME WINDOW

-- tall and wide a sleek metallic frame curved like an IMAX
movie screen suspended in mid-air

The area in front is cordoned off by rails and yellow caution
stripes Behind the imposing structure is a very mundane
brick wall theyre in the basement of the facility

Crowded around the Time Window are technicians monitors
consoles at once the highest of high tech and a spaghetti
mix of wires cables and jury-rigged photon-pushing stuff
The steady low background hum of high voltage

Denny slides into an open chair pulls a headset on The
chair next to him is empty

DENNY
What are we waiting for

GUNNARS leans back from his console We recognize him as the
man wearing the weird goggles at the disaster site

GUNNARS
Ready to rip

DENNY
Let ‘er rip

Denny watches the monitors instead of the screen Doug
notices mounted above his console asmall pink flyswatter

SERIES OF SHOTS - ALL ALONG THE RHIC

The shunting arrays come alive as the magnets within are
energized Components slide into place extra power is routed
through the ring --

INT BROOKHAVEN - MAIN LAB - DAY

SHANTI a female technician calls out

SHANTI
Symmetries not yet matched Catching
up in four three two one okay

symmetries are matched
IN THE WINDOW the brick wall DISAPPEARS as static resolves
into a crystal clear IMAGE of the Orient Point Ferry Dock
The ferry is there unharmed intact A bright sunny day
Crowds of WEEKDAY COMMUTERS getting on board
Its as if the machine has ripped open a hole in reality
Doug stares at the scene Turns to Pryzwarras

DOUG
Is this video

PRYZWARRA
Nope

DENNY
Wheres my audio

Gunnars remembers thats his job scans his console

GUNNARS
Uh compensating for audio delay just
a second --
Suddenly a WALL OF SOUND hits them LOUD -- people

chattering cars revving as they drive forward the ferry
horn BLARING Doug and Pryzwarra jump

GUNNARS (CONTD)
Uh now compensating for major
technical blunder by idiot tech guy on
the pre-set audio gain
(over his shoulder)
Sorry

He lowers the sound

SHANTI
Were locked Minus four days six
hours three minutes and forty-five
seconds

Doug looks up at the MISSION CLOCK behind Shantis console --
0701 082505AM and counting He turns to Pryzwarra again

DOUG
Digital re-creation

PRYZWARRA

(smug)
Nope

DENNY
(to Gunnars)
The guy with the backpack blue
jacket

GUNNARS
Im on him

Doug watches as Gunnars manipulates the round spin controls
horizontal updown and forwardback Like the spin controls
used on a camera dolly hooked up to be read by computer A
rocker arm above adjusts to different magnitudes of movement

Gunnars spins the controls --

IN THE WINDOW the VIEW CHANGES follows the man with the
backpack through the crowd Doug is astonished

DOUG
You cant do that You cant change
the angle on video shot four days ago

PRYZWARRA
You cant do this either Keep your
eyes at the edge of the screen

He pulls Doug sideways as Doug watches the screen --

DOUGS POV as he moves sideways more of the scene is
revealed he can see ‘around the corner of the Window

Doug moves his head back and forth confirming the effect
He takes in the room again thinking

ON SCREEN the man with the backpack meets up with his
family Denny frowns

DENNY
Not our guy Back to general
surveillance

Denny tosses his headset aside comes over to Doug

DENNY (CONTD)
All right Doug Lets get you up to
speed --

DOUG

Youve developed a working time
window You can look into the past
From the looks of things its a
prototype machine developed on
limited funds --

(slight smile)
-- probably no more than ten billion
Youre using it as an investigative
tool trying to find a clue to the
identity of the ferry bomber

Denny and Pryzwarra are impressed

DOUG (CONTD)
The only thing I dont understand is
why youre looking at four days ago
and not yesterday when it happened

PRYZWARRA
We can only look back four days
(nods at mission clock)
Four days six hours and change
(MORE)

PRYZWARRA (contd)
But thats it No more no less We
cant see ten minutes ago --

GUNNARS
We cant look back and see if there
was a second gunman --

DENNY
We can look anywhere But the when is
always four days ago A single
trailing moment of now in the past

Doug thinks a moment

DOUG
So -- three days from now -- youll be
able look back to -- yesterday
(realizes)

Youll be able to see the explosion
see who did it Youll see him as he
does it

DENNY
Yes

PRYZWARRA
But three days could be too late The
guy might have left the country by
then Or he might strike again We
need to do what we can now

Doug looks up at the screen He looks at the Window at the
people in the crowd

DENNY
We know hes back there somewhere
planning this We just need to know
where to look
(to Doug)
So -- Agent Doug Carlin Where do we
look

Doug sits down in the chair next to Denny --

DOUG
Claires house

EXT CLAIRES HOUSE - AFTERNOON
Numerous FBI vehicles are parked in front of Claires house

A BROOKHAVEN SATELLITE VAN pulls up behind them and parks
idling

INT BROOKHAVEN - MAIN LAB

IN THE TIME WINDOW the view TILTS DOWN at the ground
then PULLS BACK up into the air Quickly a good section of
the state of New York can be seen below

Shanti types ON HER MONITOR a grid appears over a video
feed of the scene Superimposed are various CIRCLES that show
the range of the Time Window

A small DOT appears on the edge of the largest sphere

SHANTI
Within range

DENNY

IN THE TIME WINDOW the view PLUMMETS down to finda
residential housing track keeps going comes to a jolting
STOP just above the asphalt of the street

The view TILTS UP to reveal CLAIRES HOUSE
The view CREEPS over the lawn right up to the wall --

-- and then THROUGH THE WALL to reveal CLAIRE KUCHEVER
lovely young very much alive She wears a conservative bra
and panties and is just pulling on a blouse

IN THE LAB A complete shock to Doug this is the woman he
saw dead in the morgue

IN THE TIME WINDOW Claire starts to button up the blouse
turns and looks directly INTO CAMERA

CLAIRE
(smiles)
Hello there

IN THE LAB Everyone freezes What the hell

IN THE TIME WINDOW Claire waits thinks a moment Tilts her
head an even bigger smile INTO CAMERA

CLAIRE
(bright friendly)

She waits but of course theres no answer Claire looks off
chews her lip Takes a breath This time a bit more formal

CLAIRE
Hello Im Claire
(corrects herself)
My name is Claire

IN THE ROOM Uneasy glances Gunnars is freaked

GUNNARS
Too weird can she see us

PRYZWARRA

Only Denny seems to be enjoying himself

DENNY
Lets just see what happens

IN THE TIME WINDOW Claire frowns sighs Tries again

CLAIRE
Hi Im Claire but you guessed that

(she cringes)
God thats terrible

Doug suddenly figures it out

DOUG
Rotate the view I want to see what
shes looking at

IN THE TIME WINDOW The view moves to reveal -- a MIRROR on
the wall Claire is looking at her own reflection practicing
her smile and greeting not happy with any of them

CLAIRE

Claire Pleased to meet you
(with attitude)
Right Im Claire So how am I doing
so far
(a la Bond)
My name is Kuchever Claire Kuchever

God this is pathetic Its the blouse

Claire pulls the buttons undone turns to pick out a new
shirt

IN THE LAB Doug stares at the screen Perhaps hes
remembering her fathers words as he says her name

DOUG
Claire Kuchever

Gunnars notices his intense focus

GUNNARS
Did you know her
DOUG
We held hands once But no Ive never

met her

Gunnars frowns at that A thought hits Doug and he pulls out
his cell phone Hits a button --

Faint laughter on the phone

IN THE TIME WINDOW the VIEW MOVES FORWARD and TWISTS DOWN to

‘look into the book -- too late Claire snaps it shut
SHANTI

Okay bye

Claire hangs up finishes the pasta preparation Scoops some
out onto a dish sits down to eat and read

IN THE LAB Doug turns to Pryzwarra

DOUG
I want her appointment book brought
here also any notes diaries

checkbook photos any record of any
kind I want to know everything there
is to know about her

PRYZWARRA
I dont see the point of this We
should be concentrating on the ferry

DOUG

Its likely our man scoped out the
ferry yes But we dont know when or
what he looks like We could look
right at him and not know

(back to the screen)
But well notice a change even a
small change in this womans life

Pryzwarra looks where Doug looks -- staring at Claire who
just sits at the table reading Pryzwarra shrugs

PRYZWARRA

might take a while

clicks on a photo Ginger her cat grabbing onto the couch
Claire has added that timeless caption Hang in there Baby

Doug smiles glances up --

IN THE TIME WINDOW Claire dabs off her makeup Turns on the
shower checks the water She steps out of her skirt

IN THE LAB some embarrassment among the observers

SHANTI
Tell me is there any scientific or
forensic insight likely to be gained
by spying on this woman in the shower

GUNNARS
She might sing us a clue

Shanti frowns at the joke IN THE TIME WINDOW Claire
continues to disrobe

DOUG
Well do what any normal average
house guest would do
(smiles)
Lets check out her medicine cabinet

He nods to Gunnars who (somewhat reluctantly) moves the Time
Window view away from Claire toward the mirrored medicine
cabinet A brief out-of-focus glimpse of Claires nude form
in the reflection --

-- and then the view MOVES PAST the mirror into the cabinet
There is just enough light coming in around the edges to see
theres not much there

GUNNARS
Aspirin dental floss cough drops
not even a sleeping pill This woman
needs a vice

IN THE LAB Pryzwarra sighs heavily Its pretty obvious he
thinks theyre wasting their time Doug checks a box
confirms the same medications

DOUG

Whats on the other side of the wall
SHANTI

Kitchen
DOUG

Lets check it out

IN THE TIME WINDOW the view pushes THROUGH THE WALL into the
kitchen The view does a slow 360 scan Doug frowns --

DOUG
Huh No tomato timer

SHANTI
Say again

DOUG
I noticed it when I was in the house
before This funky little food
timer in the shape of a tomato Next
to the microwave Its not there

GUNNARS
Maybe shes going to buy one Or
borrow one Or get one as a gift --

PRYZWARRA
Great Lets all keep an eye out for
the funky tomato timer Im sure its
the key to the whole goddamn case --

IN THE TIME WINDOW Claire suddenly appears wearing a
bathrobe and towel

CLAIRE
Is someone there Hello

IN THE LAB everyone pays sudden attention

IN THE TIME WINDOW Claire goes to the door checks to make
sure its locked

SHANTI
She heard a noise maybe

GUNNARS
Probably the cat

DOUG
Follow her

IN THE TIME WINDOW Claire enters her bedroom lays down in
on the bed Opens up her journal starts to write

IN THE LAB Doug searches finds opens up the same journal
He flips through pages --

IN THE TIME WINDOW the view shifts to over Claires
shoulder looking down at the page as she writes --

‘Nothing much special today Got that weird Im-being-watched
feeling again but Im sure its nothing Need to install
lights outside the house Trade the cat in on a German
Shepherd I feel like a goldfish Its like someones out
there

CLOSE ON the same journal page Doug watches her write what
shes already written Weird

PRYZWARRA
Maybe someone is out there Could be
shes being stalked

IN THE TIME WINDOW the view shoots upward then tilts
looking down at the house It ZOOMS DOWN quickly around the
perimeter of the house

GUNNARS
Nope Nobody there Nobodys watching
her

DOUG

Not true We are

IN THE TIME WINDOW the view peers in through the Window
then moves through centered on Claire

Shes set the journal aside turned the light off Laying on
her side she stares out at the dark Eyes open but no way
to tell what her thoughts might be

Doug watches her

Claires eyes close and her features relax Her expression is
pure no one around no one to see Simple unaffected no
artifice no agenda

Naked and vulnerable

Dougs expression softens as well lost in her features
in the beauty of her peaceful expression

Mourners dressed in black Claires funeral in progress

Ecclesiastes)
Everything God does will remain
forever There is nothing to add to it
and there is nothing to take from it
God has done this so that men should
be in awe before Him

people at the grave Near him a GROUNDSKEEPER works laying
down strips of sod

CLAIRES MOTHER
Claire loved lighthouses Ever since
she was little They made her feel
safe and whenever it rained shed
listen for the foghorn

Doug scans the crowd somber looks red eyes silent tears
-- but nothing that doesnt belong Then he notices --

distance approaches from across the green The man carries a
bright bouquet of flowers

Oh yeah Poor guy comes here every

never found the right person to share
it with
ON DOUG as he turns back to the funeral

She loses it a little bit her eyes come up and happen to
find Doug He gives her a slight nod of encouragement

front of him --

ON THE JOURNAL PAGE in Claires hand Went shopping today

ON THE JOURNAL PAGE mostly blank A hand comes in -- Claire
writing onto the page ‘Still looking for someone who

IN THE WINDOW Claire is lying by her fireplace now a glass
of wine in one hand her journal open She stops writing
stares at what shes written Just someone

Then she tears the page out of the journal and tosses it into

That’s the phone booth

ON SCREEN a fuzzy BLOB that might be a phone booth It’s a
bad angle no way to tell if anyone is there

bank customer every time she shifts position

PRYZWARRA
Shit This is useless --

Doug points ON SCREEN at the base of the phone booth
a dark blob with a blurry white logo

STALHUTH
Huh Camcorder bag maybe

DOUG
You have access to face-recognition
software right

STALHUTH
Yeah

Obviously wrong NEXT MATCH a woman walking across an

intersection bag over her shoulder NEXT MATCH --

The tachyon field nullifies all

complex electrical impulses including

heartbeat and brainwave activity
(beat)

Anything that goes through comes out

dead on the other side

DOUG
Youve tried

Denny and Pryzwarra exchange a look

PRYZWARRA
I cannot confirm or deny that

DENNY
Trust me Doug Theres no way around
it Not even theoretical You go
through you die

DOUG

What about a warning A radio signal --
GUNNARS

Its too complex --
SHANTI

The field would scramble it --
DOUG

(exasperated)

Then what about a note

They all look at each other
DOUG (CONTD)
A note A single piece of paper
one sheet

Again the team looks to Pryzwarra --

PRYZWARRA
Were under strict orders The Window
is approved for use as a retroactive
surveillance tool only --

DOUG
But it is possible
GUNNARS
If we keep the mass low
PRYZWARRA
(whirling)

No no NO
The group erupts into heated debate everyone but Denny --

GUNNARS
Im just talking about tolerances
I think its possible

PRYZWARRA
Do you have any idea the metaphysical
can of worms --

SHANTI
But we have to try dont we

DOUG
We could stop this Andy We could
save all those people --

PRYZWARRA
Dont you think I want that Suppose
we do save the ferry -- great So

instead the guy blows up a hospital --
or the Brooklyn Bridge at rush hour
Only this time we never catch him and
he does it again and again --

DOUG
Then well have to send a warning that
gets him apprehended and put away for
good prior to the first explosion

Pryzwarra thinks about that

PRYZWARRA
How

DOUG
We send it back to ourselves To me
at the Bureau An anonymous tip that
someone is planning to bomb the Orient
Point ferry on July 4th
(thinking it through)
(MORE)

DOUG (contd)
We know the suspect was at the dock
with a camcorder the night before
Instant search warrant -- they find
the bomb -- we could have him in
custody before he even meets Claire --

PRYZWARRA
We could also create a paradox that
rips a hole in the fabric of Time and
Space and wipes out mankind

DENNY
Which would probably cost us our
funding

Doug and Pryzwarra both turn to look at Denny

DENNY (CONTD)
Well it would

PRYZWARRA
Youre not worried about changing the
past

DENNY

No Because you cant

(a beat)
Anything youre gonna do you already
did Whether you send a note back or
dont send a note back it doesnt
matter You cant change the past
its physically impossible

GUNNARS
(at his console)
Windows back up

IN THE WINDOW Claire kneels with Janice coaching her
through a childs prayer Doug watches for a moment Then

DOUG
What if theres more to it than
physics

DENNY

You mean something spiritual Fine
Look it this way

(he leans in close)
Gods mind is made up about this
Call it fate destiny whatever -- it
already happened And it always will

DOUG
Maybe But Ive spent my entire career
chasing people after theyve done
something horrible

(MORE)

DOUG (contd)
For once Id like to stop someone
from ever hurting anybody in the first
place Can you understand that

Doug looks over sees that Pryzwarra has been listening
They exchange a look

INT BROOKHAVEN - DAY

Giant SHUNTING MAGNETS -- huge circular arrays -- are
recalibrated and lowered back into place --

EXT FBI FIELD OFFICE - DAY
A BROOKHAVEN SATELLITE VAN pulls up in the parking lot --
INT BROOKHAVEN - MAIN LAB - DAY

Gunnars designs an armature to hold the warning note in
place

INT BROOKHAVEN - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Pryzwarra writes out the warning while Doug dictates

DOUG
You know this would go faster if I
did it myself --

PRYZWARRA
Yeah and then you recognize your own
handwriting and the universe blows up
Continue

DOUG
Terror suspect will be at Orient
Point dock 440am

PRYZWARRA
We cant be that specific It has to
hold up in court that someone could
have phoned this in without using a
time machine

DOUG
Itll hold up Just dont leave any
prints on the note

Pryzwarra looks at his fingers glares at Doug -- now he
tells me He crumples the note and starts over

PRYZWARRA
(writing)
How can you be sure youll take this
‘anonymous tip seriously
DOUG
There was ah there was a reporter
I worked with a few years back The
way were phrasing this Im pretty
sure Ill think its from him

PRYZWARRA
Would this reporter be David Campbell

Doug doesnt answer Clearly this is a sore subject --

PRYZWARRA (CONTD)
Flight 800

DOUG
You read my file

PRYZWARRA
No McCready told me Id be curious
to hear your side of it

Doug looks grim But it had to come up sooner or later

DOUG

The official word on Flight 800 was
that degraded wiring under the main
fuel tank caused a short and triggered
the explosion But Campbell suspected
a cover-up -- that the plane was in
fact shot down during a Navy exercise
four miles south of the flight path

PRYZWARRA
And you believed him so you stole
evidence --

DOUG

I did not believe him I wanted to
prove that he was wrong

PRYZWARRA
So you stole evidence --

DOUG
I took a seat cushion from the forward
cabin to run independent tests on the
fabric for missile residue
(beat)
Yeah I stole evidence

PRYZWARRA
What did you find

DOUG
The Bureau arrested Campbell and
confiscated the samples before we
could finish the tests

PRYZWARRA
And what happened to you

DOUG
Read the file

Shanti approaches

SHANTI
Were ready

INT BROOKHAVEN - MAIN LAB - DAY

Every screen is active every station manned Doug
Pryzwarra Denny and his team are all at their places

Suspended before the Time Window held by a thin glass
armature the warning note

GUNNARS
Rings hot

DENNY
Shanti

SHANTI

Good to go here

DENNY
All right lets get superluminal

Doug and Pryzwarra watch as the Time Window brightens ina
furious mix of particles coming into focus

PRYZWARRA
What do you think will happen if this
works

DOUG
To us

(Pryzwarra nods)
I imagine well all instantly pop into
some other part of our lives with no
memory that any of this ever happened
»- and you and I would never meet

Pryzwarra ponders that for a moment Then
PRYZWARRA

Hey thats worth the ten billion
right there
BA

Doug and Pryzwarra laugh Watch as --

THE WINDOW ANGLE ROTATES from a NIGHT VIEW of the parking lot
to the exterior of the FBI LONG ISLAND FIELD OFFICE The
Bureau symbol visible on the glass doors

GUNNARS
This is zero station Were on top of
the satellite van hang on --

Gunnars works the joysticks -- the WINDOW VIEW RUSHES
FORWARD into the face of the building and THROUGH IT
down hallways through walls and floors --

DOUG
Go to the third floor southwest
corner --

The VIEW RISES THROUGH ANOTHER FLOOR and into the main office
pen -- the same open area of desks where Doug took the first
call about Claire --

DOUG (CONTD)
Thats it stop-stop-stop Right
here now pan over to the right by
the wall

The office is nearly deserted many of the desks unoccupied
as the VIEW PANS ACROSS them but two voices can be heard

MINUTI (0S)
Look I am not playing this game with
you again There are protocols here
Carlin There are procedures

DOUG (0S)
I dont play games Larry

IN THE LAB Dougs face goes slack as he watches the screen --
IN THE WINDOW is -- HIMSELF

Four days ago Doug is having a barely-contained argument
with his partner LARRY MINUTI

MINUTI
Its this lone wolf shit You have to
let me know what youre doing Let me
in on what youre thinking

DOUG
I told you it was just a hunch --

MINUTI
You told me yeah after the fact

IN THE LAB Doug watches fascinated He glances over at the
team -- Everyone else in the room is staring at him Heads
turn away quickly looking back at the screen --

GUNNARS
Eerie man

PRYZWARRA
Is that Minuti

DOUG
Yeah Thats Larry My partner
(he watches)
Jesus Id forgotten about this

Denny shoots a glance to Doug at that Checks his monitor

DENNY
Okay lets find a nice friendly
surface to push this note onto
Is that your desk

DOUG
Mine Yeah

DENNY
Line us up Goon

The WINDOW VIEW SHIFTS veering and dipping until the surface
of Dougs desk comes into perfect alignment with the warning
note mounted before it

DOUG (ON SCREEN)
Im tired of having to explain myself
every time I manage to do the job

DENNY
Thats good Shanti We need the field
to be rock solid

SHANTI
High but stable

DENNY
All right start pushing Get the
wave frame past the note

The team punches keys in a flurry boosting the gain on the
Time Window field --

ALONG THE RHIC the magnet arrays begin to realign --

IN THE LAB power surges through field emitters Denny and
his team work their stations in a low-level frenzy The
Window appears to WARP OUT like wind filling a sail The
argument in the Window continues

MINUTI (ON SCREEN)
How can I expect you to look out for
me when you dont let me look out for
you
Doug winces at that

GUNNARS
Good

DENNY
I gotta have more cowbell

More keys are punched The Time Window WARPS OUTWARD more --

DOUG (ON SCREEN)

Look I told you before -- and Im
telling you now -- I dont go outside

proper channels anymore If I peg a
guy on a hunch thats police work
not some conspiracy to keep you out of
the loop

MINUTI (ON SCREEN)
Yeah well my hunch is you stopped
caring about anyone else a long time
ago And its affecting more than just
your work

DOUG
(to Denny)
Wed better hurry If memory serves I
storm outta there in about a minute

SHANTI
Starting to redline

DENNY
Give it ten more seconds Push

Doug watches the note now IN THE WINDOW seemingly sitting
on Dougs own desk

DOUG (ON SCREEN)
I dont have time for this You do
what you have to do Larry And have a
nice vacation

DOUG
(watching himself)
No
IN THE WINDOW Doug marches away -- from his desk his

partner and the note A collective sigh of futility

DENNY
(defeat)
Thats it then Dial the ring down

The WHINE OF MACHINERY SUBSIDES

IN THE WINDOW Minuti glances down and so casually it almost
doesnt register plucks the warning note from the desk

DOUG
Whoa
PRYZWARRA
I dont believe it --
GUNNARS
Its through It went through
SHANTI
Fantastic
DOUG

We dont know if its fantastic yet
everybody quiet

They watch as MINUTI reads the note He frowns looks off --
to where Doug has just left slamming a door

DOUG (CONTD)
Come on Larry

Minuti checks his watch looks at the note again The team
watches breathless

Then Minuti comes to a decision he folds the note and grabs
his jacket heading out

PRYZWARRA
Follow him

GUNNARS
Im on him

The WINDOW VIEW MOVES WITH MINUTI down the stairs Doug and
Pryzwarra exchange smiles -- this could work

LATER - THE WINDOW shows Minutis car (the same car that was
found later at the ferry dock) driving down a highway at
night The IMAGE IS SHAKY as Gunnars works the controls
struggling to keep up with a moving target

Pryzwarra looks worried as they watch He whispers to Doug

PRYZWARRA
Why would he go without backup

Doug grows pensive

DOUG
Because he thinks thats where Im
going He thinks I went without
backup
(a look)
Lone wolf shit

ON SCREEN Minuti passes Exit 30 eastbound on the LIE A
CRACKLE OF STATIC comes from the screen

DOUG (CONTD)
Whats happening

The image of Minuti on the road FILLS WITH STATIC

SHANTI
Were losing the signal

DENNY
Goon keep up with him

GUNNARS
I cant hes driving out of range

DENNY
(off Dougs look)
The mobile satellite rigs only have a
range of about five miles

PRYZWARRA
Can we get some more antennae out
there

SHANTI

Weve only got the goggle rig left

Doug glances up at the mission clock 420am in the past

DOUG
Cut away from Minuti The bombers due
at the dock -- well pick up Larry

when he gets there

IN THE TIME WINDOW A WIDE ANGLE taking in most of the FERRY
DOCK AND PARKING AREA The ferry itself is in view moored
and silent Doug and the team watch intently

DOUG (CONTD)
Where is he

Doug checks his laptop A FREEZE FRAME of the security camera
video The timecode reads 044037AM

PRYZWARRA
We should be able to see him by now

DOUG

Maybe he didnt park in the lot
(to Gunnars)

Bring it around in a circle

The WINDOW VIEW pans across the side of the lot past
lightposts trees hedges --

DOUG (CONTD)

Hold it Right there Move in

The VIEW NARROWS until they all

see it -- a man in a dark
sweatsuit climbing through one

of the hedges

DENNY
Son of a bitch

DOUG
I wanna see his face

IN THE WINDOW the man has a camera bag over one shoulder As
he steps onto the dock the light reaches his face --

Doug goes dead pale

DOUG (CONTD)
He was at Claires funeral
The groundskeeper

The man -- his name is CARROLL OERSTADT -- lifts a camcorder
to his eye and begins taping scoping the facility

PRYZWARRA
Thats it thats our pc right
there Wheres your partner

DOUG
(to Gunnars)

Pull back Show me the back of the
hedge but dont lose the suspect

The Window retreats to a WIDE DOWN ANGLE revealing the back
of the hedge -- where a red JEEP GRAND CHEROKEE is parked

DOUG (CONTD)
Move in on the license plate --

Suddenly another car drives past --

SHANTI
Thats your partner

DOUG
Wait follow Minuti

PRYZWARRA
We need the plate --

DOUG
There is no plate follow him --

THE WINDOW follows Minutis car into the dock parking lot
Doug looks up at the clock 439AM and counting --

DOUG (CONTD)
No wait back over to the dock hurry

THE WINDOW PANS OVER to Oerstadt who is still taping the
ferry as Minuti pulls into the lot The wash of Minutis
HEADLIGHTS passes over him --

-- exactly as they did in the security video startling him
y as they did before causing him to step back out of
view exactly the same way --

DOUG (CONTD)
(yelling at Gunnars)
Move it over stay with him

THE WINDOW catches up with Oerstadt as Minutis car suddenly
cuts him off from the hedge --

MINUTI (ON SCREEN)
Freeze

Oerstadt halts in his tracks camcorder still in hand
Minuti gets out of the car weapon drawn

MINUTI (CONTD)
Federal Agent Put the camera down and
drop the bag

Oerstadt starts screaming absolutely terrified

OERSTADT
(a thin mousy whine)
Oh my gosh Oh my gosh

MINUTI
Drop the bag NOW

OERSTADT
(bursting into tears)
IM SORRY DONT KILL ME TAKE THE
BAG TAKE IT DONT KILL ME --

MINUTI
(trying to shout over him)
Im not -- listen Im not going to

hurt you Listen IM A FEDERAL AGENT

OERSTADT
(wailing like a baby)
DONT KILL ME DONT KILL ME
PLEASE DONT KILL ME

In the lab Doug and Pryzwarra look at each other -- could
this actually be the wrong guy The man tries to drop his
shoulder bag but its caught on his sleeve --

MINUTI
CALM DOWN
(moving closer)
IM NOT GOING TO HURT YOU DROP THE
BAG --

OERSTADT
IM TRYING IM TRYING --
(the bags still caught)
DONT KILL ME IM SORRY IM SORRY --

And it happens too fast to see Oerstadt transfers the camera
to his other hand revealing a TAZER GUN and FIRES --

Both darts fly into Minutis chest wires trailing Minuti
jerks and spasms in electrical shock HIS GUN FIRING WILD --

DOUG
Larry

PRYZWARRA
Jesus

Glass shatters Minuti falls to his knees -- Oerstadt pulls a
crowbar from the bag -- the tears and hysteria instantly gone

-- and bashes Minuti across the face once twice --

SHANTI
Oh my God

DOUG
No no no --

Minuti falls face-first to the ground Oerstadt hauls his
body off the blacktop drags him back through the hedge --

THE WINDOW FOLLOWS to Oerstadts SUV -- which now has a thick
bullet hole in the back window so does the side window an
apparent exit wound --

Oerstadt dumps Minutis body into the back of the Cherokee
and slams it shut runs to the drivers side --

PRYZWARRA
Jesus what do we do

Doug watches the screen paralyzed

IN THE WINDOW Oerstadt pulls away from the dock and onto the
road picking up speed fast

PRYZWARRA (CONTD)
What are we gonna do

DENNY
I dont know but pretty soon hell
drive out of range

The Cherokee races down the empty road the TIME WINDOW
barely keeping up in the pre-dawn light

Doug stares at the screen wheels turning fighting panic --
until suddenly

DOUG
Goggles

GUNNARS
What

Doug races to the wall where the goggle rig hangs on a rack
with its backpack He tears them down and races for the door
swiping the lock with his cardkey --

DOUG
Keep the phones clear stay with him

EXT TIME WINDOW LAB - DAY
Doug bursts through the door and out into broad daylight
temporarily blinded He hauls the backpack rig over to his
car and hurls it into the passenger seat --
INT DOUGS CAR - DAY
Doug pulls out his cell phone as he peels out of the lot
INT BROOKHAVEN - MAIN LAB - DAY
A frenzy of crosstalk as Dennys console phone RINGS --

PRYZWARRA
Turning onto Churchill Headed for the
Expressway

INTERCUT - DOUGS CARTIME WINDOW MAIN LAB

Doug makes a hard right turn at the same time reaches over
to the backpack pulls the goggles out of their holster --

DOUG
(into headset)
Keep him in sight as long as you can
and feed me directions Ill track him
with the goggle rig

IN THE LAB the team members all look at each other

PRYZWARRA
Can he do that

DENNY
If he can catch up to the image and
keep it in sight yeah that could
work

DOUG (0S)
Somebody tell me how to turn this
thing on

ON THE EXPRESSWAY Dougs car rockets out of the on-ramp
speeding and weaving past HEAVY MIDDAY TRAFFIC --

IN THE LAB theyre watching Oerstadts car while Denny feeds
instructions to Doug The image starts to BREAK UP

SHANTI
Going out of range
DENNY
Doug we have your signal Try the
goggles --
DOUG (0S)
Hold on --

PRYZWARRA
(watching Oerstadt)
Hes approaching Exit 33 Were losing
him

IN THE CAR Doug struggles to pull on the goggles passes a
sign for Exit 33 Ahead

DOUG
Is he getting off the freeway

PRYZWARRA (0S)
Cant tell yet --

DOUG
Did he take the exit Did he take it

DENNY (0S)
We lost the signal Were blind here

Doug hits a switch on the side of the goggles and brings them
up to his eyes and as he does --

DOUGS POINT OF VIEW - THE ROAD AHEAD

-- and full of cars WIPES SEAMLESSLY into A PERFECTLY-
MATCHED VIEW of the same highway rain-slicked and empty
still going by at 90mph

DOUG slips the goggles down his nose then up again trying
to get used to this Without the goggles daylight and
traffic With the goggles rain and empty highway

DOUG
Holy

He puts them back on just in time to see a RED JEEP CHEROKEE
barreling past in the opposite direction --

DOUG (CONTD)
Shit

IN THE LAB Shanti switches the Time Window over to the VIEW
FROM DOUGS GOGGLES as the Jeep passes --

SHANTI
Thats it -- whoa there he goes

DOUG jams the wheel into a high-speed U-turn crossing the
grassy meridian tires spewing earth He reverses course --

-- vaults onto the westbound lanes not another car in sight
on the empty highway --

DENNY (0S)
Doug traffic

DOUG pulls the goggles down as a SCREAMING 18-WHEELER BEARS
DOWN ON HIM horns blaring cars swerving all around --

DOUG
WHOA

Doug spins the wheel hard -- the big rig roars past him
filling the highway -- Dougs car fishtails --

DOUG (CONTD)
Shit-shit-shit-shit-shit --

IN THE MAIN LAB the WINDOW VIEW veers wildly matching
Dougs head movements --

DOUG (0S) (CONTD)
I lost him I cant see past this
truck

PRYZWARRA
We see him

DENNY
Doug look straight ahead Weve got
the Window slaved to your goggles
Hes a quarter mile ahead of you

Doug checks the real-time traffic around him and looks at the
truck timing his move -- then quickly pulls the goggles up --

DOUGS POV - THROUGH THE GOGGLES

as the truck VANISHES REVEALING Oerstadts Cherokee pulling
into the middle lane a quarter mile ahead

DOUG weaves through traffic speeding after him -- pulling
the goggles down to watch the road pulling them back up to
check on Oerstadt back and forth between the present and the
past -- A SPLIT-LEVEL CAR CHASE four days apart

IN THE MAIN LAB Denny watches as Oerstadts Cherokee tops a
slight rise then dips out of view for a second --

DOUG approaches the same rise traffic all around him --
THE WINDOW VIEW tops the rise revealing Oerstadt and several
other cars stopped dead in the middle of the highway by an
early morning CONSTRUCTION CREW
PRYZWARRA
(reflex)
LOOK OUT STOP
DOUG slams on his brakes squealing rubber in a 90mph skid --

CARS VEER AND SWERVE around him horns blaring narrowly
missing him --

Dougs car comes to a dead halt in the center lane CARS
SCREAMING BY HIM ON ALL SIDES

DOUG
What the hell

PRYZWARRA (0S)
Im sorry he stopped

DENNY (0S)
The Jeeps stopped in the middle of
the highway Doug Theres some kind
of construction going on --

DOUG
Jesus Im gonna get killed--

Doug pulls the goggles on --
-- to discover that hes literally in Oerstadts back seat

DOUG stares forward in shock His car has almost completely
overlapped the Jeep both of them stalled in the middle of
the highway He stares at the back of Oerstadts head
oblivious to the HORNS AND SQUEALING TIRES all around him

Oerstadt turns slowly a figure in sinister silhouette He
turns until hes gazing back back at Doug it seems then
down into the back seat

Doug follows his gaze down to LARRY MINUTI lying on the
floor where Dougs feet should be bleeding from the head
s moaning at the edge of consciousness

PRYZWARRA (0S)
Hes alive Hes still alive --

Minutis image is SUDDENLY WHISKED AWAY as Oerstadt applies
the gas and wheels the Jeep hard over Doug falls backwards
through the image as Oerstadts back seat and rear door RUSH
FORWARD AND PASS THROUGH HIM -- leaving him on the road
outside watching the Jeeps taillights recede

A BELLOWING HORN AND SQUEALING TIRES snap Doug out of it in
time to yank the goggles down --

A TWO-STORY CHARTER BUS FILLS HIS REAR WINDOW squealing
toward him in an uncontrolled skid Doug floors the gas and
turns out of the way but too late --

The bus clips the back of Dougs car smashing out his rear
windshield and crushing the left side of his trunk Doug is
thrown into the steering wheel --

IN THE LAB THE WINDOW VIEW spins over and THROUGH the
stalled cars the construction site --

PRYZWARRA (CONTD)
Doug --

DOUGS CAR spins across two lanes of traffic finally slams
to a halt halfway up a drainage ditch He pulls himself off
the wheel forehead bleeding A VOICE is shouting in his ear

DENNY (0S)
Are you all right Doug are you all
right

DOUG
Where is he

Doug pulls the goggles on -- nothing but white static
DOUG (CONTD)
The goggles are smashed I cant see
anything --

IN THE MAIN LAB theyve still got a view The WINDOW shows a
SKEWED ANGLE of the shoulder where Dougs car is stalled

DENNY
We still have a signal here

PRYZWARRA
We can talk him through it --
(into phone)
Well talk you through it Can you
still drive

DOUG (0S)
Which way

SHANTI
(jumping in)
He took the exit ramp behind you

DOUG (0S)
Are you sure

SHANTI
Yes

GUNNARS
Just before the spin-out I saw it
too --

EXT DOUGS CAR - DAY

Wheels spray dirt as Dougs car plows up the side of the
ditch and onto the roadbank --

IN THE CAR Doug sets the broken goggles on his dashboard
facing out

DOUGS CAR lands on the exit ramp back on solid road
Gaining speed hes headed for a fork --

DOUG
Left or right

PRYZWARRA (0S)
We cant see that way --

Doug grabs the goggles aims them one way then the other --

IN THE WINDOW the road to the right is empty To the left a
PAIR OF TAILLIGHTS disappears around a bend --

EVERYBODY IN THE LAB
LEFT LEFT GO LEFT --

DOUG skids through a left turn -- back in pursuit In pursuit
of a Jeep he cant see

DOUG
Somebody talk to me

DENNY (0S)
Youre on him --

THE WINDOW VIEW winds along the road shows Oerstadts Jeep
plowing across railroad tracks toward the Pine Barrens --

PRYZWARRA
He just crossed the railroad tracks
two hundred yards ahead
(a beat)
Doug

ON DOUG as he stares blankly ahead theres now a COMMUTER
TRAIN approaching the same crossing Hes seconds away from a
collision --

Doug jams the wheel hard plows off road and parallel to the
tracks -- hes racing the train Pulls even He times his
move spins hard over --

DOUGS CAR jumps the tracks mere inches from the speeding
train Crunches earth on the opposite side fishtails plows
through someones backyard and back out onto the road --

IN THE WINDOW Oerstadts Jeep is now dead ahead coming
around the curve that Doug just skipped

PRYZWARRA (0S) (CONTD)
Youve got him Great shortcut

Doug takes a deep breath lets it go in a shaky rush

DOUG
Yeah Great shortcut

DENNY (0S)
Hes headed into the Pine Barrens
From here it should be a much slower
ride

Dougs car decelerates to a manageable 45mph heading off
down the road into winding woodland

DISSOLVE TO
EXT PINE BARRENS - DAY

Tall trees dirt roads deep deep woods DOUGS CAR winds
through pine and brush approaching a clearing

DENNY (0S)
Hes slowing down considerably now
Do you see that

A BURNED-OUT COLLAPSED BUNGALOW fills the clearing
surrounded on all sides by steep evergreens The place is
blasted to ruin a roofless black shell

DOUG
Yeah I see it Whats he doing now

PRYZWARRA (0S)
Hes pulling over to the right of the
bungalow hes parking there

Doug stops the car a few dozen yards away and gets out the
goggles around his neck He surveys the wreckage

DOUG
Looks like another bomb went off

DENNY (0S)
Really Were seeing a finished house

DOUG
No damage

DENNY (0S)
None

Doug pulls out the backpack puts it over one shoulder
GUNNARS (0S)
Youve got about ten minutes charge
left in the pack

DOUG
Can you still see this way

DENNY (0S)
Yeah this works

Doug approaches the blackened facade of the bungalow his
shoes crunching over charred timber Something stops him

Skid marks deep in the forest soil His gaze follows them
over to a LARGE HOLE in the bungalows front wall

PRYZWARRA (0S)
Doug hes pulling Minuti out of the
car

Doug looks to where Oerstadt parked -- now an empty area of
flattened grass He watches listening Over his headset he
can FAINTLY HEAR the sounds from the Time Window

DOUG
Can you boost the audio

The hiss over Dougs headset JUMPS IN VOLUME He hears A MAN
straining with a burden Then something dragging being
dragged Through the grass towards the house

Doug follows tracing every invisible step as it happens a
scene straight out of Rebecca

PRYZWARRA (0S)
Hes taking him inside

DOUG
Is Larry moving

PRYZWARRA (0S)
Cant tell yet

THE SOUND OF A SCREEN DOOR slapping shut Doug follows to the
front of the house retracing Oerstadts steps through the
hole and into whats left of the interior

INT BUNGALOW - DAY

The charred remains of a stolen ambulance lie nose-first ina
deep sinkhole in the middle of the floor Doug surveys the
blackened hulk

DOUG
Do you see a vehicle inside
An ambulance

PRYZWARRA (0S)
No nothing

THE SOUND OF A BODY BEING DRAGGED continues past Doug
across the floor

The room beyond the wrecked ambulance is almost featureless
save for ragged shards of wall black debris and A SINGLE
METAL ARMCHAIR bolted to whats left of the floor

In Dougs ear the chair creaks

PRYZWARRA (0S) (CONTD)
Hes putting Larry into a chair

DOUG
I see it
(he calls out)
Larry

No answer Doug starts to look around --

PRYZWARRA (0S)
Dont turn away --

DENNY (0S)
We need to stay wide on the chair

Doug puts the backpack down sets the goggles on top of it
facing the chair

DOUG
Let me know if he moves out of frame

A LOUD TEARING SOUND suddenly fills the headset

DOUG (CONTD)
What is that -- is that duct tape

PRYZWARRA (0S)
Ah yeah hes ah
(clears his throat)
Hes taping Larry to the chair

Doug approaches that chair dread building in him He looks
down at it -- and notices dark bands on each armrest where
residual adhesive has trapped extra soot He looks closer

Not just soot Blood A lot of it Down the arms of the
chair down the legs --

Lying in the soot he spots A PAIR OF GARDEN SHEARS the kind
with big rubber handles thick enough to cut bone

Over his headset A WEAK MOAN

SHANTI (0S)
Oh God hes waking up

The moan is SUDDENLY MUFFLED by another stretch of duct tape
Dougs face goes dead slack

Picks up the sheers notices a metal floorplate He drops
to his knees pounds on the plate

DOUG
Larry LARRY

OVER HIS HEADSET a new sound LIQUID SPLASHING HEAVILY onto
the chair Members of the team can be heard gasping

DOUG (CONTD)
Whats that What is that

PRYZWARRA (0S)
(clearing his throat
again voice thick)
Thats ah hes pouring some kind
of accelerant over Agent Minuti

Doug is frantic now running his hands through the soot
brushing the plate clear until suddenly he finds a handle

DOUG
I found something hold on

Drawing his weapon Doug grabs the handle holds his gun
ready and heaves the plate up and open with a crash --

ON DOUG as he stares down into the hole in blank horror
Finally he finds words

DOUG (CONTD)
Everyone brace yourselves youre
about to witness a murder

INT BROOKHAVEN - MAIN LAB
Pryzwarra spins away from the Window

PRYZWARRA
Everybody out Out Now

Shanti Gunnars and all the other technicians abandon their
stations heading for the door -- everyone but Denny --

PRYZWARRA (CONTD)
You too

DENNY
I cant

PRYZWARRA
You DO NOT want to watch this Doctor--

DENNY
Somebody has to stay with the machine

Suddenly the sound of BLOODCURDLING SCREAMING spins them back
to the Window -- both men look absolutely horrified --

INT BUNGALOW

Doug tears his headset off -- in horror in rage in sheer
helplessness -- fists jammed into his eyes as the SCREAMING
CONTINUES Its all he can do to hold on

Then he catches sight of something else something in the
floorboards near the chair He grows silent almost numb as
he reaches out for it He pulls it free

Its a single earring Blue pearl

EXT BUNGALOW - EVENING

The bungalow is now an official FBI crime scene cordoned off
by INVESTIGATORS and CSI TECHS

One agent reaches into the pit where Minutis body was found
Pulls out a folded packet of what look like blueprints
and a thick scrapbook overflowing with photos and clippings

EXT BUNGALOW - EVENING

Doug stands stares out at the forest An AGENT wearing a
headset approaches him

AGENT
If it makes a difference -- and I know
it doesnt -- weve identified him

His name is Carroll Oerstadt and hes
booked on a flight to Paris tonight

Doug nods

AGENT (CONTD)
You found him just in time

Doug just looks at him
INT DOUGS CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
Doug drives back to Brookhaven his face a sullen mask
INT TIME WINDOW LAB - NIGHT
Pryzwarra and the team are arguing as Doug enters
SHANTI
If we hadnt sent him there he
wouldnt be dead now
GUNNARS

No he was already been dead from the
ferry we just changed how he died --

PRYZWARRA
How do you know that We just used a
Time Machine For all you know he was
standing right next to you till the
second we sent that note back

DENNY
We didnt change anything We cant
Thats what Ive been trying to tell
you --

DOUG
We changed one thing

Everyone turns Doug walks past them faces the Window

DOUG (CONTD)
The suspect was driving a stolen Jeep
Cherokee when he cased the dock It
was big enough to drive the bomb onto
the ferry and hed already changed
the plates He already had an SUV

(beat)

Then Larry showed up and put bullet
holes in the windshield and left blood
all over the back seat

The team members wait Doug turns to look at the Window --

DOUG (CONTD)
So now he needs a new car

The team members grow silent as the full implication of that
fact hits them

PRYZWARRA
(a whisper)
No
IN THE WINDOW Claire enters her house with a bag of
groceries and dumps her keys into a dish near the door Her
cat trots off after her as she heads into the kitchen

CLAIRE (0S)
Hey lil scruff

Doug watches the screen Helpless
INT INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - TERMINAL - DAY

Carroll Oerstadt sits comfortably in an airport chair travel
bag at his feet Just another passenger waiting for a flight

But the longer we watch the more obvious it is Oerstadt is
highly aware of everything around him

Other passengers the ticket counter a pair of flight
attendants strolling past his eyes miss nothing

And so he notices when --

An AIRPORT SECURITY GUARD reaches for his pager He reads the
display looks surprised Moves away quickly just as --

At the ticket counter a black phone BUZZES and a SUPERVISOR
hurries to pick it up Listens a moment nods Hangs up goes
to the nearest COUNTER ATTENDANT speaks low in her ear --

Through the windows in the street a POLICE TRUCK pulls up --

Oerstadt doesnt hesitate He picks up his bag walks quickly
toward a BAGGAGE INSPECTOR Oerstadt is suddenly DISTRAUGHT --

OERSTADT
I only left my bag for a minute
I swear A minute

INSPECTOR
Is there a problem

Oerstadt drops his bag pushes it at the Inspector

OERSTADT
I came back from the bathroom and
a man was doing something with it He
ran away

INSPECTOR
Did he take anything

OERSTADT
(sudden panic)
NO he DIDNT take anything You think
he left something I was only gone for
a minute What if he planted a bomb

Oerstadt said that a little too loud --
INT AIRPORT - CORRIDOR - DAY

The Inspector carrying Oerstadts bag leads Oerstadt toward
the Security Office --

INT ATRPORT - SECURITY OFFICE - DAY

Oerstadt enters and waits SECURITY PERSONNEL hurry past on
their way out but take no notice of him

IN THE FOREGROUND a printer prints out a photograph a black
and white enlargement of OERSTADTS DRIVERS LICENSE PHOTO A
SECRETARY takes the photo to a copier passing by Oerstadt
but not making the connection --

The Inspector gestures to a small waiting area Heads off
with the travel bag

INSPECTOR
This will be just a minute

Oerstadt looks over toward the waiting area Plastic chairs
along a wall beyond them a door marked EXIT

INT MAINTENANCE CORRIDOR - DAY

Oerstadt alone moves quickly down the corridor

INT TUNNEL WALKWAY - DAY

Oerstadt exits a door into the wide public walkway He is
very aware of the security camera up near the ceiling Walks
briskly away from the airport toward the parking garages
Oerstadt arrives before an elevator He looks longingly
toward the stairs but no a normal passenger would take the
elevator Hits the button

INT ELEVATOR - DAY

The doors close Oerstadt punches the button for Parking
Level One and waits

The lights flicker off Then back on again
Oerstadt punches Pl again several times No movement

He hits the Door Open button -- nothing Looks up sees the
security camera --

POV SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE BLACK and WHITE looking down at
Oerstadt He smiles ruefully nods his head resigned Slides
down the side of the elevator to a sitting position arms on
his knees

Confined in the small space by four close walls he already
looks like hes in jail --

-- as the doors split and FBI agents race in guns raised --
INT INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Oerstadt sits on his hands rocking on his chair His eyes
shift to McCready as enters and sits opposite next to Doug

Pryzwarra hangs by the wall

MCCREADY
Id like to know why you did it

OERSTADT
Did what

McCready just stares at him

OERSTADT
Oh gosh Im in trouble arent I

MCCREADY
Why did you cut off her fingers

Oerstadt hesitates looks slyly at McCready His hand comes
up rubs at the mostly-healed scratches down one cheek

OERSTADT
(whispers their secret)
You know that

MCCREADY
Why did you pick Claire Kuchever in
the first place

OERSTADT
I needed a car

MCCREADY
Thats it

OERSTADT
(worried)
I think so

MCCREADY
And that doesnt bother you

OERSTADT
Should it bother me

MCCREADY
Yes

OERSTADT
Okay It bothers me

Oerstadt leans down as if for the benefit of the microphone

OERSTADT
I went to her house on the pretense of
buying her car And then I taped her
mouth and then I threw a hood over her
head And then I stole her car and
then I took her to my cabin and then
I soaked her in gasoline and

DOUG
Then

OERSTADT
(smiles at Doug)
I think you know what happened after
that
(back to McCready)
And now now I feel really bad

MCCREADY
She was innocent They all were

OERSTADT
I know but you dont understand
the whole story

MCCREADY
Why dont you tell us the whole story

OERSTADT

Gosh I dont know the whole story
Maybe maybe she could have gotten
drunk the next night swerved over the
line and killed five people So when I
killed her I saved them

(nods like it makes

sense)
See

Pryzwarra cant take it any more He gets in Oerstadts face

PRYZWARRA
Fuck that By far the most likely
scenario is that if you werent a
goddamn psychopath those people would
be alive today

Oerstadts voice drops to a whisper

OERSTADT
Unlikely things happen to me all the
time

DOUG

Like a plane that blows up without
explanation in mid-air

Doug dumps Oerstadts scrapbook onto the table Photos and
yellowed press clippings spill out in a fan all of them
about the Flight 800 disaster

Oerstadt looks over -- and we see the intelligence behind his
eyes for the first time unmasked He sits up straight

OERSTADT
Yes Like that
(smiles)
Are you the good cop

DOUG
Is that why you did it
Oerstadt thinks all pretense of fear gone
OERSTADT

Sure why not An angry man
distraught over losing a loved one on
the ill fated Flight 800 blames the
military for the disaster and
subsequent cover-up He strikes back
through a senseless terrorist act
(shrugs)
Tell that to the families theyll
appreciate the closure

MCCREADY
You didnt lose anyone on that flight

Oerstadt taps a finger onto one of the press clippings pulls
it clear of the pile and slides it over to McCready

OERSTADT
I did Her name was Melissa Jean
Brooks she was twenty-six years old
and she died on that flight

Doug leans over spins the press clipping around and shoves
it back at Oerstadt

DOUG
No We already checked with her
friends and family You never knew
her You picked a woman at random on
that flight to obsess over and thats
all

OERSTADT
She was the love of my life

DOUG
You never even met her

Oerstadt leans forward

OERSTADT
If that plane hadnt gone down how
do you know I might not have met her

Doug stares back He has no answer to that Shakes off the
question

DOUG
You admit that you set a bomb onto the
Orient Point ferry
OERSTADT
Yes Agent Carlin I set a bomb onto
the Orient Point ferry

A straightforward confession Its a bit of a shock to
three men
PRYZWARRA
You dont seem very concerned
OERSTADT
Yeah weird huh
DOUG
How is that
OERSTADT
I dont know But somehow I know that
Ill never be convicted for any of
this In fact I dont think this
case will even go to trial
He smiles at Pryzwarra then McCready then Doug

INT BROOKHAVEN - MAIN LAB - DAY
Jack McCready stands before the team

MCCREADY
Were shutting you down

Everyone in the lab is stunned

DENNY
Will you tell us why

MCCREADY
Weve got what we need The forensics
the suspect a confession Were done

Everyone talks at once --

SHANTI
You cant --

GUNNARS
We cant stop now --

PRYZWARRA
Sir I really think we need more
evidence to make a conviction stick --

DOUG
(off Pryzwarra)
Hes right
(MORE)

all

DOUG (contd)
The confession could be ruled
inadmissible We need to keep
gathering evidence --

MCCREADY
Gathering evidence would have been
fine Agent Carlin but you went
further than that didnt you

Doug starts to say something stops -- he has no defense

MCCREADY (CONTD)
We had protocols in place Agent
Carlin Strict protocols But you had
to push And now an agents dead

DENNY
That would have happened anyway --

MCCREADY
Were done here people Power it
down lock your stations and
surrender your cardkeys outside
Experiments over

McCready marches out headed for the door --

DOUG
What about Claire Kuchever

McCready stops

MCCREADY
Charging Oerstadt in the Kuchever
murder would raise too many questions
about how we obtained the evidence
We cant risk it

DOUG
So were dropping the case

MCCREADY
We have him on the ferry bombing and
killing a Federal Agent Thats
enough

DOUG
What do we tell her family

MCCREADY
Nothing Her case will remain open
and her murder will go unsolved --

DOUG
You cant do that Hes going to kill
her in six hours --

MCCREADY
He killed her four days ago You were
at her funeral Whats wrong with you

A final look at Doug then McCready exits Doug watches
him go then turns and glares at Pryzwarra

INT BROOKHAVEN - RHIC RING - DAY

Doug marches away from the lab Pryzwarra catches up to him
Doug spins around about to deck him when --

PRYZWARRA

about the warning

DOUG
Then how did he find out

PRYZWARRA
I dont know -- maybe he fired up the
Window four days from now and watched
us do it and sent himself a note
I dont know

Dougs glare softens He claps Pryzwarra on the shoulder a
silent apology As he turns to gos

PRYZWARRA (CONTD)

(Doug waits)
Its not your fault Claire dies

Doug tries to smile

DOUG
Yeah thats one theory

He heads away up the ring Pryzwarra watches him go

Denny reaches past Doug swipes his card gets a green light
DENNY (CONTD)
The only thing I havent figured out

Doug looks surprised then walks in without a word Denny
follows

INT TIME WINDOW LAB - MINUTES LATER
Denny moves between stations activating the Time Window
On his console is a folded-out map of Long Island with one

area circled in red Denny manipulates Shantis console until
the display shows the same area

DENNY
Weve only got a few minutes before
they bust in here and shut us down

Doug stands in front of the Time Window Apprehensive

DOUG
You dont have to do this --

DENNY

(laughing)
Oh yes I do Youre going to try to go
back no matter what I say correct

(doesnt wait for an

answer)
If I dont want you to ruin our
collider in the process I absolutely
have to do this

DOUG
What makes you so sure

DENNY
(a laugh)
Youll see

For some reason Doug has Claires tomato timer in his hands
He turns it over and over as he waits

Behind him THE TIME WINDOW ACTIVATES in a burst of static
coalescing resolving Doug looks back --

IN THE WINDOW a view of SEVERAL PEOPLE IN ROBES AND PAJAMAS
watching a baseball game on TV

DENNY (CONTD)
Is that it

DOUG
Yeah thats it

DENNY
Hah Unbelievable

Doug takes his gun from under his jacket Hikes up his pant
leg and sticks it into an ankle holster Hiking up his other
pant leg he does the same with his Bureau ID

DENNY (CONTD)
Almost ready

Doug waits growing restless as the HUM OF MACHINERY around
him increases He turns the timer in his hands

DENNY (CONTD)

Okay Now
DOUG
Yeah No Wait
Doug takes something from under his jacket -- a typewritten
sheet of paper -- and pins it to his lapel
DOUG (CONTD)
Yeah
(Denny just stares at him)

DENNY
You know youre gonna die here
Theres no way around that you are

starts taking air in shallow gasps heart pounding Then --

DOUG (CONTD)
Doctor
(Denny looks up)
If you ever manage to perfect this
thing Id really love to know what
happened to that plane

It takes Denny a moment to understand Then he nods

A SUDDEN BUZZING at the door startles them both The door
remains locked Someone has just been denied access to the
lab by the re-coded security lock

LOUD POUNDING follows Denny checks his console

DENNY
Ten seconds

The HUM of machinery becomes a HIGH WHINE Doug winds

Doug whispers something under his breath -- it could be a
prayer it could be a curse well never know -- as the
WINDOW ENVELOPS HIM -- the LIGHT BECOMES BLINDING the WHINE
BECOMES DEAFENING -- and at the last moment Doug opens his
eyes and screams

Suddenly EVERYTHING RECEDES INTO DARKNESS Denny the lab

INTERCUT FLASH IMAGES - AMBULANCE AND BUNGALOW

The bungalow door swings open -- Oerstadts silhouette fills
the frame dragging something behind him

DOUGS EYES narrow at the wheel

Oerstadt drags A SCREAMING WOMAN across the floor Her
screams are muffled face hidden under a muslin hood

DOUG makes the turnoff for the Pine Barrens tires squealing

OERSTADT drags the woman over to the metal chair bolted into
the floor Her heels scrape the floor as she screams

DOUG wipes the sweat out of his eyes squints searching --

Oerstadt heaves the woman off the floor -- she gets an arm
free and claws at his face Deep gouges a rush of blood He
punches her in the head -- a BLUE PEARL EARRING falls --

DOUG swerves down a wooded dirt road fighting panic --

OERSTADT tapes the womans wrists to the chair -- she
struggles he ignores it --

DOUG is lost He slams the brakes throws into reverse
wheels spinning dirt backing up --

DIESEL FUEL pours onto the woman splashing her hood dousing
her clothes -- Oerstadt empties a five-gallon drum over her --

The woman seizes and gasps her cries muffled shes
struggling to breathe Oerstadt looks down at her hands at
her splayed fingers

Blood under her nails

He goes to a workbench takes a pair of GARDEN SHEARS from
its hook Brings the shears to her fingers until all five are
between the blades just above the knuckle She screams ina
kicking frenzy unable to move

He grips the handles squeezes --

AND AN AMBULANCE COMES CRASHING THROUGH THE WALL BEHIND HIM
Oerstadt whirls in shock pelted by splinters and glass He
drops to the floor crawls for cover --

DOUG pushes out of the ambulance weapon up and out

DOUG
Freeze Federal Agent

He aims into every corner spinning searching

Oerstadt is gone The ambulance lights strobe red-and-white
casting eerie shadows its headlights shining bright

A FIGURE DARTS THROUGH THE LIGHTS Doug tracks it --

DOUG (CONTD)
I SAID FREEZE

Doug fires a round The silhouette freezes --

DOUG (CONTD)
DOWN ON THE GROUND NOW ON THE
GROUND

OERSTADT
Oh my gosh oh my gosh Im sorry

Oerstadt shuffles out of the headlights hands up crying --

OERSTADT (CONTD)
DONT KILL ME DONT KILL ME PLEASE
DONT KILL ME --

And it happens too fast to see he fires a tazer at Doug
Who catches the wires and yanks pulling Oerstadt off his
feet -- where Doug headbutts him full in the face

Oerstadt staggers falls back Doug yanks him forward again
and punches him in the mouth Oerstadt crashes onto his back

DOUG
FACE DOWN ON THE GROUND NOW
ROLL OVER
(he kicks Oerstadt over)

Now
Oerstadt rolls over Doug kicks the tazer away circles him
with his gun -- its taking everything he has not to shoot
this guy

Doug reaches into his jacket for his phone never taking his
eyes off Oerstadt -- when suddenly the ambulance dips behind
him its front wheels CRACKING THROUGH THE FLOORBOARDS --

And Oerstadt is on him instantly slashing with the garden
shears KNOCKING DOUGS GUN AWAY --

Doug falls Oerstadt lunges blades snapping at Dougs face

Doug jumps up onto the hood Oerstadt bears down with the
shears aiming at Dougs neck --

Doug grabs the blades holds them open with his bare hands
He cries out in pain -- blood appears between his fingers --
yanks hard to one side --

The blades punch through the metal hood next to Dougs neck
» and then theres a loud SPLINTERING SOUND the ambulance
DIPS VIOLENTLY --

THE ENTIRE FLOOR GIVES WAY TIPPING THE AMBULANCE NOSE-FIRST
INTO A SINKHOLE

Oerstadt rolls off but Doug falls in -- looks up to see the
ambulance SLIDING DOWN TO CRUSH HIM He ducks it stops short
-- but now hes trapped under the vehicle

FRANTIC FOOTSTEPS above Doug edges out He hears SOUNDS
something heavy rolling across the floor Crunching grass A
door slams a motor starts

Doug stands up just in time to see TAILLIGHTS DISAPPEAR
OUTSIDE His face goes slack

Oerstadt got away
Failure Doug retrieves his gun -- then whirls --
The woman is still taped to the chair Hooded and bound

Doug approaches She turns suddenly beneath the hood her
breath freezing at his approach
94

Doug halts a mix of fear and wonder Is it really her

He reaches for the hood -- stops suddenly to wipe his face
and fix his hair a kid on a prom date ridiculous moment --
reaches for the hood again

The SHADOW OF HIS HAND brings a whimper from the woman

Doug takes the hood in his fingers and lifts revealing
duct tape lifts it off of her face completely

Douglas Carlin and Claire Anne Kuchever stare into each
others eyes for the first time Doug is breathless

DOUG (CONTD)
Jesus youre real

Claire SCREAMS THROUGH THE TAPE eyes bright with terror --

DOUG (CONTD)
No-no-no ITS OKAY ITS ALL RIGHT
Look Im a Federal Agent -- wait --
(fumbles with his jacket
thrusts his ID at her)
jent Im here to get

Claires screams trail off into violent sobbing Doug pulls
the tape off of her mouth --

CLAIRE
GET ME OUT OF HERE

DOUG
I will I promise Hold still --

Doug peels at the tape around her wrists but cant get his
fingers under it He scratches at it fumbling Claires
tears subside He smiles awkwardly at her

Doug ponders that for a moment Which is when THE INCENDIARY
BOMB GOES OFF BEHIND HIM

FIRESHOT scatters through whats left of the bungalow THE
FLOOR IGNITES AT ONCE flames running across spilled fuel --

CLAIRE
Oh my God --

Doug claws at the tape Claire strains at her bonds --

Doug looks around frantic -- the wrecked ambulance protected
them from the blast but now its burning too --

CLAIRE
How do you know that How did you know

Doug thinks it over -- where to start He looks at her

DOUG
What if you had to tell someone the
most important thing in the world but
you knew theyd never believe you

CLAIRE
Id try You dont know for sure what
someone might believe

She dabs his head again throws another cotton ball away

DOUG
(a beat)
You wont believe me but Just for
the sake of argument lets pretend
that the FBI has this special device
and that I know whats going to happen
in the next six hours

CLAIRE
I dont believe you
(catches herself smiles)
Wow I guess your first prediction
just came true

Claire dabs his head again throws the cotton ball away

DOUG
Itd make things a lot easier if you
just go with me on that --

CLAIRE
(a sudden thought)
Wait a second If you know whats
going to happen how come you didnt
you know I was going to hit you

Doug pauses -- good question Claire smiles (gotcha) and
throws another cotton ball away --

I thought you said I was safe

DOUG
I was wrong Claire I do know whats

That brings fear to Claires eyes

DOUG (CONTD)
Claire just look at me
Theres no argument I can make that

telling the truth

Claire looks at him her expression softens a bit As
bizarre as this is she does believe him --

The phone RINGS Claire moves to answer it

DOUG (CONTD)

(a beat)

CLAIRE
What do we have to do

INT JEEP - MOVING - EARLY MORNING

Doug drives Claire in the passenger seat peppers him with
questions

CLAIRE
Why not just call the police and just
arrest him at the ferry

DOUG
Ive seen the plans for the bomb
Theres a remote detonation device If
we confront him were just killing a
different group of people

CLAIRE
So arrest him before he gets to the
ferry

DOUG

In the city

(shakes his head)
I dont know where he is until he
gets to the ferry Then its too late
No the safest way to separate him
from the bomb is to let him put it
in place

CLAIRE
You know how to defuse a bomb
DOUG
(smiles)
I do that one
Claire shakes her head its all too wild but she is
fascinated
CLAIRE
So you said you were part of a

special surveillance unit
(Doug nods)

And youve been watching me
(Doug nods)

What else do you know about me

Doug grows quiet He sighs

DOUG
Everything

He glances over at her

DOUG (CONTD)
I know that you support yourself as a
childrens book illustrator I know
that eight months ago your fiancé
suddenly broke it off and refused to
return your phone calls I know that
youve been turned down by three
adoption agencies since January
because they wont place a child with
a single woman on a freelance income

Claire gasps
DOUG (CONTD)

ever having a big family And that you
say grace before meals even when you
dine alone That you write poems in
your Christmas cards That you love

He walks away without listening Claire watches turns away
» and walks into OERSTADT who stands before her smiling

OERSTADT
Youre looking for the car deck miss

Claire seizes in terror He smiles friendly in the
confidence that she cant possibly know who he is

Claire realizes he thinks she doesnt know him Tries to keep
her voice even

CLAIRE
Can you I left my purse in my car

She forces her eyes up to his Meets his gaze He looks
straight into her soul His smile melts Frozen moment

Oerstadts sudden lunge for her and the struggle that

Oerstadt Pushes off the rail and runs down the walkway --

INT CAR DECK - DAY

Over a hundred vehicles parked end-to-end on two levels
along the keel and down four center lanes

Doug vaults a chain barrier Looks around the parking bay
seems deserted all the cars empty

Doug pulls his gun Edges through the parking bay trying to
keep hidden while searching for the Explorer Not an easy
task -- there are military vehicles and at least one school
bus obscuring his views

He hears something -- someone trying to strike a flint over
and over Doug comes around a vehicle with his gun --

Surprising the Ferry Worker trying to light his cigarette

FERRY WORKER
Aaaa What the --

DOUG
Get out Now

The Ferry Worker scrambles to his feet runs out of the bay
Doug never gives him a second glance --

ON THE SECOND LEVEL HULL RAMP

Claires Explorer rests on an incline above the main car
deck three cars away from the hydraulic door-ramp that leads
to open water --

-- and ten feet above Doug who stands looking up at it

MOMENTS LATER -- Doug is on the second level edging toward
the vehicle He glances at the bumper -- the license plate
has been removed

He looks through the back window -- FOUR ORANGE BARRELS
inside He looks through the front windshield

Where his eyes meet CLATRES staring back at him in wet
terror wrists bound to the steering column duct tape over
her mouth a thin whine building in her throat --

DOUG (CONTD)
CLAIRE Jesus --

He claws at the door handle --
-- when TWO TAZER WIRES fire into his back zapping him into

a seizure Doug jerks spasmodically drops the gun falls
over the rail --

Doug lands on a car shattering its windshield Hes on his
back eyelids fluttering at the edge of consciousness --

DOUGS POV - the underside of Claires car -- and OERSTADT
wearing an orange life vest looking down at him from the
ramp above

Oerstadt reaches into his camera bag no hurry Pulls out a
pipe bomb Doug moans tries to move -- Oerstadt pounds the
pipe bomb once on the rail and tosses it at him --

Doug slides off the hood just as the pipe bomb falls through
the shattered windshield THE CAR EXPLODES debris flying --

Doug slides under a military transport truck crawling for
his life Another pipe bomb pounds the rail another toss --
THE TRANSPORT TRUCK EXPLODES --

ON THE RAMP Oerstadt holds another pipe bomb but cant see
which car Doug is hiding under The PARKING DECK IS FILLING
WITH SMOKE -- OTHER CARS ARE CATCHING FIRE --

Doug crawls beneath another vehicle trying to make his way
back under the ramp A POOL OF BURNING FUEL spreads after him
-- another pipe bomb falls EXPLODES --

CLAIRE glares out the windshield as Oerstadt walks by her
window -- he bends out of view comes up with Dougs gun
paces in front of the vehicle looking for Doug --

Claire struggles to pull her wrists free of the wheel her
fingers straining to reach the GEAR SHIFT just out of reach

DOUG drags himself out from under a station wagon climbs
onto it Oerstadt paces above --

Doug sees his chance leaps for the overhanging ramp above
and grabs the edge He pulls himself up --

-- and finds himself staring into the barrel of his own gun
Doug hangs there in resignation -- its over

Oerstadt stares at him about to fire --
DOUG
I have a message for you from
Melissa Jean Brooks

Oerstadt blinks momentarily dumbstruck

OERSTADT
What

DOUG
Go to Hell
Oerstadts shock becomes sudden fury -- he aims the gun into
Dougs forehead --

-- as Claire suddenly pulls the Explorer out of gear and
rolls into him from behind knocking him off-balance
Oerstadt spins and falls hard his camera bag slamming into
the rail with A METALLIC BANG --

-- and with THE DISTINCTIVE SOUND OF ONE OF OERSTADTS PIPE
BOMBS SUDDENLY PRIMING He and Doug exchange looks

OERSTADT
Oh my gosh -- OH MY GOSH

Oerstadt struggles with the camera bag but its stuck on his
shoulder OTHER PIPE BOMBS SPILL ONTO THE RAMP rolling down
the incline toward the big hydraulic door --

DOUG
CLAIRE LIE DOWN

Doug drops to the floor and rolls for cover --

OERSTADT EXPLODES taking half the second level ramp with

him The cars between Claires Explorer and the bay door

SPILL AND TUMBLE off of the ramp landing on the cars below --
Doug rolls to his feet checks his watch --

Its 1045

Another explosion rocks the entire deck BLOWING THE FORWARD
CAR RAMP HALFWAY OPEN TOWARDS THE WATER exposing a swath of
sky and a rolling horizon

Doug runs back under where the upper ramp is still solid
climbs onto it --

DOUG (CONTD)

He runs along the edge to the Explorer Pulls out Claires
keys unlocks her passenger door and gets in --

INT EXPLORER - DAY

weapons drawn and ready to fire

COAST GUARD OFFICER (CONTD)

Doug and Claire look at each other in complete dread

COAST GUARD OFFICER (CONTD)

Claire swallows fighting panic

CLAIRE

E
Theyre nearly surrounded now Doug and Claire look forward
out the windshield at the only clear path left

The open bay door whats left of the car ramp the wide
ocean beyond They look into each others eyes a shared
moment

COAST GUARD OFFICER (CONTD)
Two

Doug slides over in the seat closes his hands over hers on
the wheel Claire steps on the gas revving the engine to a
high idle The Coast Guardsmen shout to each other

And suddenly the CAR RADIO snaps on all by itself

RADIO DEEJAY (VO)
(filtered)
Its ten forty-eight on Endless Summer
Sunday now lets go back in time
to 1964 and the Beach Boys On Long
Islands 98 FM --

Doug pops the gear shift into DRIVE and Claire floors it
INT PARKING DECK - DAY

The Explorers wheels spin smoke on the metal ramp and it
shoots forward jumping the jagged edge and clipping several
cars beneath it

The Coast Guard OPEN FIRE -- the Explorer races up the bow
door like a boat over a stunt ramp and LAUNCHES OUT INTO
SPACE --

EXT FERRY - IN THE BAY

The Explorer bursts from the ferrys bow like a cannon shot
Its wheels spin in mid-air -- its nose dips plows into the
water --

INT EXPLORER

Doug and Claire are thrown into the dashboard nearly out of
their seats --

EXT BAY

The Explorer bobs in the water and comes to rest not
sinking Seeming like it wont Then --

THE FERRYS BOW SMASHES into the side of the car and plows
over it SHRIEKING METAL-ON-METAL forcing it underwater --

INT EXPLORER - UNDERWATER

Doug and Claire tumble like socks in a dryer rolling with
the submerged car -- THE BARRELS ROLL AND SMASH INTO EACH
OTHER rupturing splashing fuel all over Claires back --

THE BEACH BOYS (VO)
Well it’s been building up inside
of me for Oh I don’t know how long --

EXT UNDERWATER

The Explorer SCRAPES AND ROLLS ALONG THE KEEL as if tumbling
down a mountain upside-down -- the side windows SHATTER AND
COLLAPSE FLOODING THE CAR --

THE BEACH BOYS (VO)
I dont know why but I keep thinkin’
Somethins bound to go wrong
INT EXPLORER - UNDERWATER

SEAWATER ENGULFS THEM Claire cant see Her breath escapes
in a rush of bubbles shes panicking --

DOUGS HAND appears pulls her to the door to the window
its open -- she flails and kicks through broken glass --
-- clawing for the surface as the ferry passes overhead
churning deafening so far above -- shell never make it
shes too far down starts choking -- and beneath her --

THE BOMB EXPLODES
EXT LONG ISLAND SOUND

Claire is hurled up through white water and ERUPTS FROM THE
FERRYS WAKE She tumbles end-over-end in a SLOW MOTION FREE
FALL high over the Sound limp weightless plummeting

She hits the water face-first in a TREMENDOUS SPLASH and
disappears into the simmering water It closes over her
smoothes out becomes still

CLAIRES BODY floats to the surface hanging face down in
dark green water It bobs there hair waving in easy ripples
not moving

Floating wreckage flames on the water Stillness Then --

Claire convulses head thrown back in a wrenching gasp She
takes air in huge breaths coughing sputtering violent for
life -- struggles to tread water as a SHADOW PASSES over --

-- and suddenly THREE COAST GUARD CREWMEN splash into the
water around her Arms across her chest pull her into a back
float away to safety

EXT COAST GUARD CUTTER DECK - DAY

Claire is brought onto the deck with other FERRY PASSENGERS
more are still coming aboard coughing and sooty Behind them
the ferry BURNS FIREBOATS spray water into its bow as black
smoke billows forth

Claire doesnt hear any of it just sits trembling Her hands
shake as she brings them up and stares at them

Ten fingers all fine

She pulls her hair away from her eyes blinking As she does
her eyes focus on something something in the distance

Out there in a pool of burning fuel --

DOUGS BODY lies face up in the tide His eyes are lifeless
his body blackened his legs and lower torso are in flames
There can be no question that hes dead

CLAIRE watches frozen

Doug sways with the waves then begins SLOWLY SINKING FROM

VIEW one arm floating out at a cruel angle Just before he
vanishes forever we see Dougs hand
All five fingers have been sheared away leaving ragged
stumps

The water closes over him completely then ripples and
smoothes out until only flames remain

ON CLAIRE
In shock She blinks trembling Her eyes begin to fill

Then suddenly shes surrounded -- an oxygen mask is placed
over her mouth -- MEDICS are there calming her checking her
out pulling her away

DISSOLVE TO
EXT DISASTER RECOVERY SITE - AFTERNOON

The cutter has docked ferry passengers are unloaded as EMS
WORKERS and NEWS CREWS swarm the pier Claire wanders down
the ramp dazed Stops at a familiar voice --

BETH

Its Beth and Janice Janice runs up to Claire slams into
her Claire barely flinches still in shock

BETH (CONTD)
Claire ire
(Claire looks at her)
My God youre drenched What

Claires eyes focus She looks down at Janice looks around

A SMOKING FERRY WORKER is coming down the ramp helping a man
in a wheelchair Next to them a kid in a stroller is also
being wheeled down still sleeping

At the base of the ramp a harried TEACHER tries to get a
head count as her KINDERGARTNERS crowd around her Nearby

COP (0S)

ELDERLY WOMAN
My daughters on that ferry oh God my

CRYING MAN

ELDERLY WOMAN
(suddenly a gasp)
Chrissie

The teacher spins at hearing her name smiles as the elderly
couple rush over to meet her Around them OTHER PARENTS run
to the group and to their own children

- as the SHELL-SHOCKED WOMAN runs across the blacktop to
embrace her husband

» and the GROUP OF CADETS exchanges hugs and backslaps with
the NAVY BAND all of them laughing now

CLAIRE sees it all an epiphany of gratitude and relief
Everyone who had died before is fine Everyone

BETH (0S)
So was he the man of your dreams

Claire spins

CLAIRE

Suddenly Claire cant speak But she nods Yes

BETH (CONTD)

David and let him know were okay

CLAIRE

Thats okay -- Go Oh and Beth
(Beth turns)

Can you call my parents for me

BETH
(smiles)
Of course
(taking Janice)
Come on baby were gonna call Daddy

Janice looks back Claire smiles and gives her a wave
Claire watches them go off together across the blacktop
past the families past Search and Rescue vehicles past the
black FBI car where DOUG IS STANDING WATCHING THE DOCK --

Claire gasps so violently she nearly faints

Its Doug The Doug who we saw in the opening scene who has
never been through the Time Window who has never met
Claire

He stands by his car watching the dock taking it all in
Just as he did before

CLAIRE
OH GOD -- oh God oh God --

Claire struggles to breathe ready to pass out --

Doug is talking to ANDY PRYZWARRA who has just introduced
himself Doug asks him to step aside slightly and looks out
over the dock again

Pryzwarra scans the dock with him

PRYZWARRA
What are we looking for

DOUG
Anything that doesnt belong

Doug notices a shell-shocked woman -- CLAIRE this time --
standing alone Shes staring at him drenched and trembling

ACROSS THE DOCK

Claire sways on her feet Doug is looking at her now Claire
doesnt move

ACROSS THE DOCK

Doug looks unsettled -- that woman is still staring at him
He stares back curious now

Doug heads over to an EMS worker grabs a blanket

Claires breath freezes -- because now he’s walking TOWARDS
HER Claire doesnt move

Doug walks right up to Claire and puts the blanket around her
shoulders

DOUG (CONTD)
Its all right miss Youre in shock

AND CLAIRE BREAKS DOWN crying so hard she cant speak She
throws her arms around Doug and weeps into his neck bawling

DOUG (CONTD)
Its okay Youre okay now

Doug puts his arms around her awkwardly bewildered

CLAIRE
I don’t understand
DOUG
Shh shhhh youre gonna be fine

She starts to calm down in his arms Over her shoulder Doug
sees a group of RED CROSS VOLUNTEERS waves to one of them
behind Claires back Takes Claire that way

DOUG (CONTD)
Miss these people can help you --

CLAIRE
NO

She clings to him he pulls her hands away --

DOUG

Its okay youre going to be fine
CLAIRE

No wait
DOUG

Look youre safe I have to go back
over there --

CLAIRE
Doug

Doug stops -- she knows his name Claire gathers herself

CLAIRE (CONTD)
What would you do if you had to
tell someone the most important thing
in the world but you knew theyd
never believe you

She stands open to him still in tears
DOUG
(suspicious now)
Do you have something to tell me about
what happened here today

Claire swallows finally nods Doug considers looks around

DOUG (CONTD)
Okay Okay Hold that thought

He takes her arm They walk together -- Doug brings her over
to his car opens the passenger door for her --

DOUG (CONTD)
Watch your head thats it

INT DOUGS CAR - DAY

The door cuts off sound from outside Claire watches through
the windshield as Doug goes to Pryzwarra and confers silently
with him pointing at Claire

As she watches she feels something in her dress pocket
takes it out

A BROOKHAVEN LAB CARDKEY bearing Dougs name and photo
tomorrows date clearly visible Claire stares at it
beginning to comprehend

She hides the card as Doug slides behind the wheel

DOUG
Youre not under arrest but Im going
to need to take a statement --

As he keys the ignition his CAR RADIO STARTS -- he reaches
for the knob but stops mid-reach

THE BEACH BOYS (VO)
She told me Baby when you race today
Just take along my love with you
And if you knew how much I love you
Baby nothin’ could go wrong with
you

Doug stares at the radio transfixed somehow Claire watches
him Does he know Does he remember

Doug turns to Claire looks at her as if seeing her for the
first time Its almost as if he knows her somehow but cant
figure out how A look of deja vu

Claire looks into his eyes (Does he know Does he remember)

Doug looks away dazed then notices something new He looks
out through the windshield out at the sky

CLAIRE
What is it

Doug blinks unsettled

DOUG
It was supposed to be raining by now

Claire looks out the window -- its a bright blue sky not a
cloud anywhere She shrugs

CLAIRE
I guess God changed His mind

They look at each other
EXT DOCK - WIDE

Their car heads out of the recovery area past hundreds of
people Doug and Claire look out as they weave past

THE BEACH BOYS (VO)
Dont worry baby Dont worry baby
Everything will turn out all right
Dont worry baby Everything will
turn out all right

They pull out of the lot and drive away

FADE OUT
