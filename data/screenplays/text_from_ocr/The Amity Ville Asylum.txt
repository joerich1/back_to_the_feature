TITLE CARD Dissolves

Stray house pets are the only signs of life as families and
neighbours slumber We reach 112 Ocean Avenue a large Dutch
Colonial house The home is a classic piece of Americana
two stories plus an attic several rooms and a boathouse on
the Amityville River There are quarter round windows on the
top floor that give the appearance of eyes staring back at
us

A signpost in the front yard reads HIGH HOPES a testament
to what the home symbolizes for the family that live there

Cut TO

2INT BASEMENT 112 OCEAN AVENUE CONTINUOUS

We move slowly through the basement past various crushed
beer cans and a table full of drug paraphernalia until we
reach a bearded man in his early twenties RONALD DEFEO
JUNIOR known to his family and friends as BUTCH He sits on
a ragged sofa dozing off in front of a small Television
that displays white static

There is a digital clock on a small table by the side of the
sofa It reads 314am We hold on the clock and the time

changes to 3l5am We can see DeFeos breath drift from his

lips as cold air sweeps through the room His eyes snap
open
A hooded figure face shrouded in darkness steps from the
shadows The figure carries a 35 caliber lever action
Marlin 336C rifle Hands clad in black leather gloves the
mysterious person holds the rifle out in front of Butch A
voice emerges from beneath the hood that is so deep as to be
INHUMAN

FIGURE
Kill them Kill them all

Butch stands and takes the rifle The figure retreats back
into the shadows

Cut TO

3INT HALLWAY CONTINUOUS
The house is silent Butch quietly stalks the hallways the
rifle grasped tightly in his hands

Cut TO

4INT MASTER BEDROOM CONTINUOUS

Butch quietly pushes the door aside and observes his parents
as they sleep RONALD DEFEO SENIOR age forty three is a
heavy set Italian American man and his wife LOUISE DEFEO is
a slender woman aged forty two with flowing blonde hair
Both are lying flat on their stomachs Without hesitation
Butch raises the rifle to his shoulder and pulls the
trigger The BLAST is deafening The first shot rips into
his fathers back tearing through his kidney and exiting
through his chest Butch fires another round again hitting
his father in the back This shot pierces the base of Ronald
Seniors spine and lodges in his neckLouise DeFeos eyes
open but she barely has a few seconds to react Butch aims
the weapon at his mother as she lays prone on the bed and
fires two shots in quick succession The bullets shatter her
rib cage and collapse her right lung Both bodies now lay
silently in fresh pools of their own blood

Cut TO

5INT HALLWAY CONTINUOUS

Butch in an almost trance like state walks down the hall
and quietly nudges the door to another bedroom

Cut TO
6INT BOYS BEDROOM CONTINUOUS

Butch enters the bedroom that his two brothers MARK aged
twelve and JOHN aged nine share He walks between their
two beds as they lie on their stomachs sleeping soundly
Standing directly above his two helpless brothers Butch
fires one shot into each of the boys as they lay sleeping

The bullets tear through their young bodies ravaging their
internal organs laying waste to the lives that lay ahead of
them Mark lays motionless while John whose spinal cord
has been severed by his brothers heartless attack twitches
spasmodically for a few moments after the shooting

Cut TO

7INT HALLWAY CONTINUOUS

Stangely the loud shots have not roused the remaining
members of the DeFeo family and Butch skulks unchallenged
to his final destination-the bedroom shared by his sisters
DAWN eighteen years old and ALLISON aged thirteen

Cut TO
8INT GIRLS BEDROOM CONTINUOUS

As Butch enters the room Allison stirs She looks up just
as Butch lowers the rifle to her face and pulls the trigger
Butch then aims his weapon at Dawns head and squeezes the
trigger again literally blowing the left side of her face
off Both girls die instantly The white sheets and walls
are splattered with blood and brain matter Butch is unmoved
and expressionless He surveys the carnage for a moment
then calmly walks out of the room

Cut TO
9INT HALLWAY CONTINUOUS

Butch walks past a photograph hanging on the wall in a red
frame It shows all seven members of the DeFeo family ina
group hugging each other with smiles on their faces The
sound of children singing the nursery rhyme Ring Around a
Rosie in a slow haunting manner echoes through the house
We push in on the photograph and

warm and inviting This is DOCTOR ELLIOT MIXTER
MIXTER
Lisa Templeton

Lisa stands abruptly dropping her file in the process

LISA
Me Sorry-

Lisa scrambles to pick up the file and papers fall out of
it

LISA
Shit
Mixter smiles
LISA
Oh God Im sorry I didnt mean to
say that
MIXTER

Its quite alright Im Doctor
Elliot Mixter Come into my office

and compose herself Mixter holds the door open and Lisa
enters the office

14INT MIXTERS OFFICE CONTINUOUS
Lisa stands in the office Mixter enters and shuts the door

MIXTER
Please take a seat

Lisa sinks into a chair next to a large oak desk Mixter
walks to the opposite side and sits in a large leather chair
facing her

LISA
Ive uh brought my resume and
some references I know I already
sent a copy with my application but
just in case

MIXTER
Thank you

Mixter takes the file from her and opens it on his desk He
glances over it

MIXTER
Very good I see youve had lots of
experience cleaning private homes

LISA
Yes I uh Ive done a lot of
them

MIXTER

Well an institution such as this
one is a very different
proposition

LISA
Oh yes Yes I know Youll see Ive
also worked cleaning a school so I
am used to big areas
MIXTER
Yes Ive seen that When I say this
is a different proposition I mean
in terms of the sensitivity
required due to the nature of what
we do here

LISA
Oh yes yes of course

MIXTER
You would mainly be working night
shifts at a time when patients are
on lock down But many of our
patients here have psychological
disturbances so there may be
situations where you have to clean
up things you may not be used to
cleaning up If you know what Im
saying

LISA
I know what you mean yes

MIXTER
Would that bother you

LISA
It may be strange at first but I

actually have some experience in

that area I would clean my mother
when she lost control of her bodily
functions during her illness Its
something I got used to very
quickly It became routine

MIXTER
I see How is your mother now

LISA
Well she passed away
MIXTER
Im sorry to hear that So its

important to me that every employee
here whether they are a
psychiatrist an orderly or a
cleaner needs to fully understand
what our mission statement at this
hospital is

LISA
Okay

MIXTER

High Hopes was only built two years
ago and as an institution we have
only been running for just over a
year now So were still building
our reputation But I am very clear
on what I want that reputation to
be I intend to make this
institution one of the foremost
centres for mental health treatment
in the country If you look into my
history youll know that I have a
stellar reputation in the field of
psychiatry and I want to use that
to help others That is why I have
put my own money into the creation
of this institution We are only
just starting out but we have a
long term ambition to be considered
the best So what I require is that
every person who works at this
institution in any capacity must
be professional and sensitive to
the needs of the patients Unlike
other institutions the welfare and
care of our patients comes first
here

LISA
I really admire that and I promise
I would not let you down if I was
given this job

MIXTER
Im sure you wouldnt

Lisas face quickly contorts Mixter looks puzzled Suddenly
Lisa sneezes It shoots out so rapidly she has no time to
cover her mouth and nose She sneezes all over Mixter Lisa
looks horrified

LISA
Oh my God Im so sorry
Lisa rushes to Mixters side and grabs a tissue froma
Kleenex box on his desk She frantically wipes the saliva
and snot from his face

MIXTER
Its quite alright please sit
down I can take care of it

Lisa completely mortified sits back down An unimpressed
Mixter wipes the spittle off his face with a tissue When
hes done he stares at Lisa

MIXTER
Okay well thanks for coming in
Ill let you know

LISA
Look Im so sorry I really am

MIXTER
Its fine Well be in touch

Such is her embarrassment Lisa cant get out of the office
fast enough

CUT TO
18INT RECEPTION AREA HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL - DAY
Lisa enters the hospital A man in his thirties dressed in a

boiler suit is stood on a step ladder He is attempting to
change a light bulb in the hallway but seems to be making
hard work of it The bulb drops from his hand and smashes to
the ground Lisa looks up at him

Gswno

Lisa averts her eyes but the man is now aware of her
presence He has a Polish accent but his English is very
articulate

MAN
Can I help you

LISA
Yeah Im here for an induction
into the cleaning job

MAN
You must be Lisa

LISA
Yes thats right

MAN
Doctor Mixter said you would be
coming Im Delaney well be
working together

LISA
Oh great

Delaney climbs off the step ladder and shakes Lisas hand

DELANEY
We work nights so today well just
show you around okay

LISA
Okay thank you

DELANEY
Ill clean this up and well get to
it

CUT TO

19INT STORAGE CUPBOARD LATER
Delaney opens the cupboard door and for a moment he and Lisa
are silhouetted in the doorway Delaney pulls a string
hanging near the door and a light comes on The cupboard is
packed with various cleaning products
DELANEY
This is the storage cupboard
Everything you will need for each

task is here each shelf is
labelled

LISA
Okay

DELANEY
The most obvious task is hoovering
This is our hoover here its
straight forward Youll be
surprised that although its
powerful its very quiet because
we are working when everyones in
bed so obviously we dont want to
wake them up It has a Telescopic
suction tube and six stage filter
system So a lot more powerful than
you may be used to

LISA

DELANEY

he mop and bucket is here we
sually use standard bleach to mix
ith the water so thats straight
orward But there is this
pecialist stain remover that you
ust use if there are any stains on
he floor or carpet It needs to be
prayed and left to set for twenty
minutes before scrubbing or
mopping Its a special formula for
tea coffee water marks and other
yellow and brown discolourations on
the carpets or floors Its pretty
strong so wash your hands after you
use it

HteaBoune od

LISA
OKAY

DELANEY
One of the worst parts of the job
is we have to remove chewing gum
from lots of surfaces They dont
just stick it underneath the
tables it ends up everywhere

LISA
Gross

DELANEY
Yes I think a lot of the time its
the staff doing it not the
patients But we have this GumCart
which is a bit complicated but its
easier than just scraping the gum
The steam is super heated to one
hundred eighty degrees and
delivered at seven point zero bar
pressure It can produce a hundred
and fifteen litres of superheated
steam per minute

LISA
Is it okay if I watch you use it a
few times first so I know exactly
what Im doing I dont want to end
up burning myself or any furniture

Delaney smiles

DELANEY
No problem Now here we come to the
most dangerous chemical we have
This is a concrete cleaner very
toxic stuff so you have to wear
the face mask and gloves we have
here okay

LISA

DELANEY

This is for cleaning and descaling
brick stone and concrete and for
metal de-rusting For concrete you
must mix it one part to four parts
water Brush or spray it on with
the equipment here then leave it
five to ten minutes to set then
rinse it off But for those

stubborn son-of-a-bitch marks use
it neat

LISA
Okay

DELANEY
Dont worry if anything seems
complicated youll get used to it
But youll mostly be mopping and
hoovering in your first few weeks

LISA
Yeah thats fine

Cut TO

20INT WARD B LATER

Lisa follows Delaney into the communal area of Ward B The
walls are white and clinical Various patients are scattered
across the room each with a look of resignation in their
eyes Many stare blankly out of the window

DELANEY
This is Ward B one of two wards
youll be responsible for cleaning
each evening Essentially the main
duties will be emptying the bins
hoovering the carpeted areas and
mopping the hallways The patients
in here are Category B Theyre
mainly people who have had nervous
breakdowns and those who are
catatonic Theyre harmless Like
Missus Hardesty here

Delaney and Lisa walk over to an old woman who is sat still
in the chair Her eyes are open yet she appears lifeless

DELANEY
Hello Missus Hardesty

No response or acknowledgement of other peoples presence

DELANEY
She hasnt spoken a word in all her
time here The orderlies just lift
her from the bedroom to the day
room and back again every day

LISA
Why did you just talk to her

DELANEY
Weve still got to treat them like
human beings Otherwise they just
become like furniture and we all
lose our humanity I like to think
she can hear me even if she wont
talk to me See you later Missus
Hardesty

Missus Hardesty continues to stare into nothingness

and Lisa exit

Cut TO

21INT HALLWAY CONTINUOUS
Delaney and Lisa stroll down the long corridors

DELANEY
The patients are locked in their
rooms on our night shift but now
and again they might have an
accident we gotta clean up

LISA
Okay

DELANEY
In the day time there are nurses
who often clean up but in the night
we may be called to provide fresh
linen or mop up Not the most
pleasant of jobs but it happens
from time to time

LISA
Yeah I understand

Delaney and Lisa arrive at a doorway

DELANEY
Now here we come to the most

Delaney
difficult part of the job

LISA
Cleaning crap up isnt the most
difficult part

Delaney smiles

DELANEY
Oh no thats very easy compared to
whats behind this door

LISA
Whats behind it

DELANEY
This leads down to Ward X

LISA
Sounds ominous

DELANEY
You could say that Its where
Category A patients are held The
criminally insane

LISA
Really Doctor Mixter didnt
mention that

DELANEY
Yes well these patients are
beyond help so theyve become athe
hospitals secret Many of them
were transferred from prisons and
other institutions Doctor Mixter
probably thought he could help
them He cant The staff call this
place Blood Row

Delaney opens the door

Cut TO

22INT STAIRCASE CONTINUOUS

Lisa follows Delaney down a winding staircase As they
descend down the steps the light fades
Cut TO

23INT WARD X CONTINUOUS

Delaney and Lisa enter a long dark corridor with a row of
thick metal doors either side Two light bulbs hang from the
ceiling at each end of the corridor providing only minimal
illumination Lisas nose twitches

LISA
Whats that smell

DELANEY
It always hangs in the air No
matter how much we bleach the floor
there is always that smell of
death

Lisa looks concerned

LISA
These patients are dangerous

DELANEY
Yes But dont worry we never have
to interact directly or anything
like that You will just be mopping
the corridor and dusting

Delaney walks over to the first door on the right There is
a hatch on the door Delaney slowly slides it open and
beckons Lisa over She peers inside The cell is very basic
white walls with the only furniture being an uncomfortable
looking bed and a toilet without a seat There are thick
iron bars on one small window A skinny man in his thirties
sits on a basic bed in a white vest rocking back and forth
He has wild hair and a scraggly beard

DELANEY
Thats Jerry Kimble He was
convicted of stabbing a young
mother forty-nine times in front of
her two year-old son then killing
and sexually assaulting a woman
before smothering her four-year-old
daughter They call him the Green
Chain Rapist He was in Sing Sing
but was certified insane and his

lawyer got him transferred here He

doesnt make any noise or fuss but

he is a dangerous man Especially

towards women This next inmate is

even worse

Delaney slides the hatch shut and walks over to the next
door He slowly slides open the hatch and Lisa peers inside
Another basic white cell with only a bed and toilet A man
stands in the centre of the room with his hands behind his
back His hair is slicked back as jet black as the eyes
that stare at Lisa He smiles Delaney slides the hatch
shut

DELANEY

Thats Dennis Palmer Also known as

The Long Island Cannibal He was

abused as a child so his targets

were always paedophiles and

rapists Hed track them down and

torture them He would eat parts of

their body while they were still

alive

LISA
Thats horrible

DELANEY
The most horrible thing is that a
lot of the public thought he was a
hero

Delaney walks over to a door on the opposite side of the
hallway He slides open the hatch

DELANEY
Sadie Krenwinkel

Lisa looks inside Inside the basic cell a woman sits cross
legged on her bed She has long flowing black hair intense
eyes and a pentagram carved into her forehead She looks up
and smiles at Lisa Delaney slides the hatch shut

LISA
Whats her deal

DELANEY
She was a member of a Witchcraft
cult They kidnapped six people for
a demonic ritual Five were killed
but one got away and led police to
the cult She turned her trial into
a circus talking about lots of
crazy stuff The media enjoyed it
but she got certified insane by the
court Shes been around a few
institutions since Now shes here

LISA
Some strange stories here

DELANEY
Well those arent the strangest

LISA
Really

DELANEY
This last patient is the strangest
case

Delaney walks over to the last door on the left He slides
open the hatch A singular shaft of light coming from a tiny
barred window barely penetrates the darkness of the cell
Lisa peers inside to see a man sat in the shadows
DELANEY
This is our resident John Doe
Sometimes we have people with

amnesia Often we find out who they
are Not so with this man

LISA
Why is he down here

DELANEY

hey first brought him in about six
onths ago No one knows where he
ame from he literally just turned
p late one night An orderly found
im wandering the grounds First of
ll he was like Missus Hardesty
pstairs-catatonic Then a few

eeks later he started to respond

o Doctor Mixter and the nurses
hrough facial expressions and
gestures But soon he got violent
Very violent Hed have bursts of
rage and beat other patients One
day he appeared to have a seizure
and collapsed A young doctor tried
to take his vital signs Patient X
here throttled him so hard he

toe egcoorcasy
crushed his larynx It took six
orderlies to restrain him Now they
wont even let him out for the
obligatory hour a day exercise We

LISA
Oh God

Delaney stares at Lisa

DELANEY
God has nothing to do with this
man
Delaney slams the hatch shut Lisa looks disturbed

DELANEY

LISA
I guess not its just a lot to
take in Ive obviously never been

DELANEY

breeze blowing them Lisa looks up at a crucifix on the

wall the contorted face of a crucified Jesus Christ stares
at her Blood seeps from the crown of thorns and runs down
Christs face As Lisa gets closer to the altar she sees a
female figure sat in the front pew Lisa ebbs closer The

sisters Wiped out his entire
family with a shotgun Then the
next owners of the house only
lasted there about a month They
said they were driven from the
house by evil spirits The house
became known around the world
Thats why the recent owners sold
the land they had enough of all
the media interest and constant
tourists Have you seriously never
heard of the Amityville horror
house

LISA
I vaguely remember hearing some
stuff a while ago but I never
really took it in I honestly
didnt realise that the hospital
was on the same land

NANCY
Yup right on the spot where the
house was demolished You really
think the place is haunted

LISA
Either that or Im going crazy

NANCY
Well youre not crazy hun Perhaps
the stories about hauntings at the
house were true Maybe the house is

gone but the spirits stuck around

LISA
You believe in ghosts

NANCY
I dunno never seen one But I like
to think Im open minded Plus
youre the most intelligent girl I

DISSOLVE TO
69INT HALLWAY HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL NIGHT

Lisa and Delaney are sat on a bench in the hallway drinking
coffee

LISA
Do you know the history of this
place

DELANEY

Theres not much history Weve
only been open a couple of years

LISA
No I mean the history of the land

DELANEY
You mean what was on the land
before the hospital

LISA
Yeah

DELANEY
I know a bit about that

LISA
One Twelve Ocean Avenue The
Amityville haunted house

DELANEY
Well I dont know that it was
haunted Lots of people think
thats lies I know about the kid
that killed his family Thats
true

LISA
I didnt know about it until a
friend told me

DELANEY
Really Its a famous case

LISA
How come you never mentioned it

DELANEY
You seem spooked already I didnt
want to make it worse

LISA
Yknow why Im spooked

DELANEY
Because of the patients on Ward X

LISA
Its not just that Delaney I think
this place is haunted In fact Im

sure of it

DELANEY
Youve seen something

LISA
Remember I said I saw a little girl
roaming the hallways here I know
who she is Shes one of the DeFeo
children who were killed You ever
seen her

DELANEY
No

LISA
Honestly
DELANEY
To be honest I dont believe in all
that ghost stuff

LISA
Well I wasnt a huge believer but
I know what Ive seen

DELANEY
I believe that youve seen
something Some people are more
open to that kind of thing yknow
But me Im closed off to that
extra terrestrial stuff

LISA
Extra terrestrial is aliens

DELANEY
Whatever its called I dont know

LISA
So what do you believe in Do you
believe in God

DELANEY
Serious questions tonight

LISA
Im just curious

DELANEY
Why do you ask

LISA
Its something Ive been thinking
about How can evil exist ina

world that many people believe was
created by a loving God

DELANEY
I dont believe that God is a
bearded man who lives in the sky
Or that the Devil is a red demon
with horns I believe God and Satan
are within all of us God is our
human side Satan is our animal
side Whether we become good or
evil depends which side of us we
feed

LISA
Its a frightening thing to believe
that if God exists he is not
powerful enough to stop evil

DELANEY
Free will in the hands of a person
who feeds the Evil inside them
Thats what frightens me

Lisa ponders for a moment

LISA
Doctor Mixter must have known what
stood on this land before the
hospital

DELANEY
Of course he did He bought the
land and organised the demolition
of the house himself

LISA
Why would he build on this land
nowing the history of the place

DELANEY

Hes not superstitious Hes a
doctor they dont usually believe
in those things Amityville is full
of local legends going back even
before the DeFeos

LISA
Like what

DELANEY
Theres stories about the Native
Americans being slaughtered on this

land many years ago Some people

fq

even believed the Indian Chief
possessed that kid who killed his
family

LISA
Really
DELANEY
I dont think thats true If Ive
learnt anything from the patients
on Ward X its that some people
have a mind that works ina
different way to other people
Those people who do bad things have
fed the evil within them more than
the good Its not possession its
sickness Sickness of the soul

LISA
I dont know what to think

DELANEY
Just dont let your imagination run
away with you Lisa Youre a person
who feeds that good within you
Dont let this place feed the evil

70INT LIBRARY AMITYVILLE DAY

Lisa enters the Library She approaches a stuffy looking
middle aged woman with glasses perched on the end of her
nose

LISA

Hi sorry to bother you but my

names Lisa Templeton I rang

yesterday to set up a meeting with

Gloria Branco

GLORIA
Yes thats me

LISA
Oh great Thank you for agreeing to
meet with me

GLORIA
No problem nice to meet you Ive

set up a table in the back Ive

got a few books that may help you
with your inquiries

LISA
Thank you thats great

Lisa follows Gloria to the back of the Library

Cut TO

71INT LIBRARY LATER

Lisa and Gloria are sat at a table in a secluded corner of
the Library Various books are spread out on the table

GLORIA
So you wanted to know about the
history of Amityville dating back
to the Native Americans

LISA
Yes thats right Im writing a
college paper and I had heard some
rumours in the neighbourhood about
Native Americans being killed on
the land down on Oceans Avenue

Glorias demeanour instantly turns from jovial to serious

GLORIA
Well that area has quite a dark
history

LISA
You mean the DeFeo murders at One
Twelve

GLORIA

Yes Terrible business that Those
young children Breaks my heart to
think about such a tragedy

LISA
Yeah its awful

GLORIA
You know most of the town was very
upset when they decided to build
that mental institution on the
land That used to be a nice
suburban neighbourhood now theres
this big eye sore there We had a

thousand names on a petition But I
guess that Doctor who runs the
place has enough money to pay off
the people in high places

LISA
So what about the native Americans
Is that story about them being
killed on that land true

GLORIA
Theres something on that here

Gloria flips through one of the books

GLORIA
Ah yes here it is (Reading) In
the 18th Century there existed a
group of Native Americans in
Amityville known as The Satchem
Tribe led by Satchem Takapausha
the Chief The tribe had fled Salem
in Massachusetts to escape
persecution by the Christians who
were persecuting members of the
tribe because of their Witchcraft
practices These practices included
a ritualistic human sacrifice of
six people (The significance of Six
being related to the biblical
number of man and creation) in
order to induce the spirit of their
God The Dark Master who they
believed manifested his powers
through his devoted followers
giving them immortality The
hundred strong tribe settled in
Amityville but were later chased
off the land by local Christians
Satchem accused the Christians of
not properly compensating his tribe
for the land A war started and the
Christians hired a hunter called
John Underhill from Salem At the
site where One Twelve Oceans Avenue
was later built in Amityville
Underhill killed all of the tribe
The Indians were buried in a mass
grave on the site Before he died
Satchem vowed revenge According to
local legend Chief Satchem is

believed to have subsequently
haunted the land Various
parapsychologists and mediums have

claimed that Satchems vengeful
spirit influenced the 1974 DeFeo
murders at One Twelve Oceans Avenue
and the haunting of the subsequent
owners Although such assertions
are widely disputed

LISA
So the legend has basis in
historical fact

GLORIA
Absolutely

Cut TO

72INT STAFF ROOM HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL NIGHT
Lisa is sat with Delaney both nursing a cup of coffee

LISA
You told me the other night that
you think evil is within us all
But do you think that people can be
influenced by an evil that comes
from outside of themselves

DELANEY
Are you still thinking about this

LISA
I guess I am yeah

DELANEY
I worry that youre thinking too
much This place is getting to you
LISA
Theres something going on in this
place Something sinister And I
dont just mean the patients on
Ward X Have you not noticed that

DELANEY
Ive noticed some things
and

LISA
Why havent you said anything Or

done anything

Delaney contemplates for a moment

DELANEY
Its like the honey bee

LISA
What do you mean

DELANEY
The honey bee is fine when its
just flying from flower to flower
Then they think that a person isa
threat and they sting them They
might leave a sting but the person
will recover The bee dies So I
ask myself is it worth it

Delaney returns his attention to the cup of coffee in his
hands as Lisa disappears into her own thoughts

Cut TO

73INT LIVING ROOM LISAS HOME DAY
Lisa is sat in an armchair with a laptop resting on her
thighs On screen she is reading a Wikipedia entry

The Satchem Tribe was a tribe of Native American origin
that existed in the 18th Century They fled Massachusetts

settled in Amityville where they were ultimately murdered
over a land dispute The Tribe was renowned for practices in
line with Witchcraft and worshipped a God called The Dark
Master In 2009 it emerged that a modern cult incarnation
of the tribe existed They have adopted the traditional
beliefs of the Satchem tribe but the modern followers are
not required to be of Native American origin

Lisa scrolls down to the References section She clicks on a

link A Blog appears on screen entitled The Dark Master An

Ancient Vision for A Modern World She reads the latest Blog
POST

Our time is at hand On November 13th 2013 6 souls will be
sacrificed so that The Dark Masters devoted followers may
be blessed with immortality As non-believers perish on
doomsday the Masters loyal subjects shall live on and be
bestowed with great power and responsibility for the
direction of the New WorldLisa opens up the Calendar on
her computer November 13th is the day after tomorrow Lisa
refers back to the blog and notices the author of the last
blog post SisterSadie

Lisas mind is racing Lisa types Sadie Krenwinkel into a
Search Engine The first result is a Wikipedia entry Lisa
clicks on it She reads

Sadie Krenwinkel is a convicted murderer and former member
of The Satchem Cult a modern incarnation of a Native
American tribe who practiced Witchcraft in the 18th Century
In 2009 Krenwinkel led ten members of the cult to 1005
Dennison Drive where they subsequently tortured and murdered
five individuals One potential victim managed to escape and
lead police to Krenwinkel At her trial in 2010 Krenwinkel
outlined the beliefs of the Satchem Cult claiming the human
sacrifice of six individuals would have given them
immortality As a result her lawyer submitted a plea of
insanity and Krenwinkel was subsequently sentenced to
indefinite incarceration in a mental institution

Lisa reads further down the page and notices that the name
of the Doctor who testified to her insanity at her trial
DOCTOR ELLIOT MIXTER

Lisa slides open the hatch and looks inside The cell is
covered in lit candles with Sadie sat cross legged in the
centre of the room

LISA

Lisa slides the hatch shut She walks over to the last door

important

MIXTER
Of course come in

Cut TO

77INT MIXTERS OFFICE CONTINUOUS

Lisa enters and sits down opposite Mixter who is sat behind
his desk filling out a form

MIXTER
What can I do for you Lisa

LISA
Well what Im going to tell you
will sound really strange but I
need to tell you

MIXTER
Okay go ahead

LISA
Do you know the history of the land
the hospital is built on

MIXTER
What are you referring to exactly

LISA
Well first of all The DeFeo
murders and the infamous house that
people said was haunted

MIXTER
I am aware of the DeFeo murders
yes The hauntings well I think

its common perception now that a
lot of that was exaggerated by the
media

LISA
Maybe Are you aware of the history
of the land dating back to the
eighteenth century

MIXTER
No I cant say that I am

LISA
There were a group of Native
Americans in Amityville known as
The Satchem Tribe They were
massacred by Christians after a
dispute over the land

MIXTER
Okay Im sure theres a point to
all this

LISA
Yes Sadie Krenwinkel down on Ward
X She shares the beliefs of the
Satchem Tribe I have reason to
believe that somehow she has access
to the internet and Witchcraft
paraphernalia and shes planning on
a human sacrifice tonight to try
and raise the God she believes in
The Dark Master and become
immortal

Mixter chuckles

LISA
Im serious

MIXTER
Have you been reading up on Sadie
Its rather outlandish stuff isnt
it But I can assure you she has no
access to the internet or anything
else

LISA
Go on the internet and check out
the Blog She signs herself Sister
Sadie

MIXTER
Well that could be anyone called
Sadie couldnt it

LISA
Go down and search her cell

MIXTER
I dont believe that will be
necessary The patients on Ward X
spend twenty three hours a day in
the cell They get an hour of
exercise in a small yard guarded by
six of our staff Theres no way

that any of those patients have
access to the internet or any
paraphernalia

LISA
Then someone is helping her get
access to this stuff Someone who
works here Please Doctor Mixter
Just check out her cell and speak
to her If Im wrong about this and
its all just her delusions then
fine Ill accept that But I had
to tell you You testified at her
trial didnt you

MIXTER
Yes I did What are you implying

LISA
Nothing I just meant you know how
dangerous she is

MIXTER
Yes I understand how dangerous she
is and I appreciate you coming to
express your concerns One thing
you need to bear in mind Lisa is
office

that there are some very sick
patients at this institution We do
our best to help those who can be
helped but unfortunately the
patients on Ward X are beyond help
Their personality disorders are too
advanced their delusions are too
grandiose I worry that perhaps you
have been rather taken in by one of
those delusions

LISA
I know that it might sound like
that But can you check her cell
and speak to her Look at the blog
on the internet see if you can
connect the IP number of the writer
with a computer here at the
hospital

MIXTER
Okay look That does take time and
resources I dont necessarily have
But as youve come to me with a
concern of patient infraction and
potential threat of violence I am

duty bound to investigate

LISA
Thank you

MIXTER
In fact Ill order a cell search
immediately Stay here for a
moment Ill be right back

Mixter exits Lisa leans forward and a file on the desk
catches her eye She stands up and reaches over for it Her
NAME is on it Lisa opens it up Inside is a form Committing

reason stated is PARANOID DELUSION The date on the form is

LISA
Why are you doing this

MIXTER
Youre having paranoid delusions

having disturbing visions

LISA

Well you think you know The human
brain is a powerful thing and Im

seen But its all in your mind
Lisa its not reality Youre a
very sick girl and you need
treatment

LISA
You do this to all your staff huh
The minute we speak out we get
fucking committed

MIXTER
Staff You were never staff here

Lisa appears confused

LISA
No no Youre lying to me I know

MIXTER
Im afraid not my dear Youve

as an out patient but now the
delusions have progressed I feel

Lisa becomes upset Tears stream down her face

LISA

think about it and then well begin
counselling sessions tomorrow

LISA
Okay

Lisa sobs

MIXTER
Listen how about I take this
straight jacket off so youre more
comfortable

LISA
Thank you

MIXTER
First you must take this It will
help you sleep

Mixter hands Lisa a red pill and a bottle of water She
takes the pill and pops it in her mouth before taking a gulp
of water

MIXTER
Good girl I know its a lot to
take in but together well get
through this Now Im going to take
your restraint off Remember

promise you it will go straight

off

MIXTER

MIXTER

FADE IN

98INT TELEVISION STUDIO

A glamorous woman addresses the camera

PRESENTER
And were back with our next guest
A year ago he was a survivor of the
High Hopes Hospital mass murder
when cleaner Lisa Templeton ran
amok with a rifle claiming six
victims and injuring many others
Doctor Elliot Mixter has written a
new book entitled Shattered Hopes
which provides an account of that
fateful night as well as some
background into the mind of the
murderer Doctor Mixter good
morning

Mixter is sat opposite in a very expensive suit

MIXTER
Morning Katherine how are you

PRESENTER
Im good thank you So Doctor can
you tell us a little more about the
book

MIXTER
Well it features a blow by blow
account of the evening It was
obviously a very harrowing
experience and for me it was rather
therapeutic to deal with my
feelings about what happened in
writing

PRESENTER
How has it affected the hospital
Doctor
MIXTER
Obviously we were all left very
numb by events for a long time and
I know a lot of people in the town
felt we should close the
institution But that never
occurred to me I feel that people
should be brought closer by tragedy
and the Staff and I have definitely
become closer both as colleagues
and friends since the incident
That bond makes for a better

institution in my opinion so we
will continue to go from strength
to strength

PRESENTER
You mentioned there that some
people wanted the place to close I
know many were also resistant to
the opening of the institution in
the first place given that it was
built on the site of the infamous
house where Ronald DeFeo murdered
his family in the seventies I know
a lot of people associated with
that case were accused of
exploiting it for their own ends
Youve also faced some criticism
for that particularly as we heard
last week that you have sold the
movie rights to this book How do
you respond to that criticism

MIXTER
Well I know that some people accuse
me of hurting the memory of the
victims but I feel Im helping the
memories of those involved live on
Granted some victims were
criminally insane but other victims
were loyal staff who had families
and Im determined that they not be
forgotten Each staff member gets
their own chapter in the book so
that the readers can get a full
picture of what wonderful people
they were I always say that all
forms of media whether it be
books newspapers TV or movies
are a preservation of life Our
physical bodies may die but our
images live on when we are famous
Our work and our passion is
preserved therefore its as if our
souls are preserved Through all of
these forms of media we are in
effect immortal

Mixter looks straight into the camera and smiles

CUT TO BLACK

The sound of children singing the nursery rhyme Ring Around
a Rosie in a slow haunting manner echoes around our ears
