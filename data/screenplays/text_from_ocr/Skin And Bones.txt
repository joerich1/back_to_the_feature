INT CLASSROOM - SAME

Sidney takes a seat at the back of the room A handful
of FILM STUDENTS sit around on torn couches heavy in
discussion Sid goes unnoticed as she watches a
whirlwind debate A SNOTTY GUY is pontificating a
point

SNOTTY GUY
Sequels are too handicapped By
definition alone theyre inferior
films

Hallie sits on a couch next to MICKEY 20s atheletic
cool and rowdy Arms enwrapped

MICKEY
Bullshit generalization Many
sequels have surpassed their

original
SNOTTY GUY
Name one
MICKEY
ALIENS Far better than the

original

ANOTHER GUY
Subjective

SOME GIRL
Lifes subjective I much prefer

Ridley Scott

The conversation overlaps everyone arguing making
their point about ALIENS VS ALIEN

HALLIE
No way ALIENS rocked Stay away
from her - you bitch

SNOTTY GUY
Ill give you that one Name
another

MICKEY
T2

SOME GIRL

Youve got a hard-on for Cameron

SNOTTY GUY
A bigger budget does not make a
better movie TERMINATOR one is
historical

Someone screams out You Sarah Connor as the
TEACHER a young artsy type speaks up

ARTSY TEACHER
How about THE GODFATHER PART II

Ooooohhh The whole room goes worship silent All in
agreement

SNOTTY GUY
The almighty exception Name

genre was destroyed by sequels

ARTSY TEACHER
Really And why do you think that
is

SNOTTY GUY
Sequels suck Hello It becomes
about money and no ones
interested in quality

DEREK
Its more than that Horror films
are only as good as their villains
How can Freddie and Jason possibly
be scary after theyve been diluted
through five or six sequels

TEACHER
Whats the solution If you were
making a sequel today what would
you do differently

The class stews on this Derek turns spotting Sidney
in the back of the room She gives a half wave He
starts for her excusing himself

SNOTTY GUY
The point is - I made my point
Sequels suck

this

theyre soon devouring each other like two people in

explained yourself

fame- seeking liar and - forgive me

for saying - mediocre writer who
has a cold storage shed where her
heart should be
This stings Gale

GALE
You have every right to be upset

DEWEY
Page 41 Deputy Dewey oozed with
inexperience

GALE

I never meant to imply

DEWEY
How do you know my dim-witted
inexperience isnt merely a subtle
form of manipulation used to lower
peoples expectations thereby
enhancing my ability to effectively
maneuver within any given
situation

Gale is at a loss

GALE
Im sorry I dont know what else
to say except Im sorry

DEWEY
No Im the one whos sorry I
misjudged you Now if youll excuse
me I have some oozing to do

Dewey turns and limps away leaving Gale staring after
him Her face smashed fiat

ON STAGE

more than one killer is
responsible

year of your life - how do I
apologize for that

A long silence Sidney is hanging on by threads
SIDNEY
Cotton there isnt one day one
hour one minute when Im not
reminded of what Ive done I have
not had one second of reprieve and
no therapy or religion or spiritual
plane can ever erase what I feel in
every vein of my being And I wish
I had in me what you need to hear
but I dont think the words exist

More silence

COTTON
I just thought if I saw you face to
face maybe it would help

SIDNEY

COTTON
Youre a self-obsessed little cunt
like your mother

And with that Cotton flips on a dime His face turns

turned you into this bitch with a
cell phone But I bet sometimes
late at night when youre all

surface and in a moment of clarity

fondled

Gale stares at him stunned A moment as the tension
swirls about them

The car comes to a halt in front of a stop light

POLICE GUARD 1
We feel like Kevin Costner

Sidney smiles at this just as the car door rips open on
the passengers side Two hands reach in and yank
Police Guard 2 from the car He starts to CRY OUT but
its cut short

Sid SCREAMS as the Police Guard behind the wheel
struggles with his seat belt He looks up to see a
Ghost Masked Figure move around the side of the car
towards his door He reaches for his gun but its too
late The Ghost has the door open

A flash of silver and the Police Guards throat is
slit

IN THE BACK SEAT

Sidney SCREAMS and SCREAMS BEATING on the door of the
car It wont open Shes trapped like a caged animal
IN THE FRONT SEAT

The Ghost pulls the Police Guard from the car then
gets in behind the drivers seat The Ghost puts the
car in drive and takes off down the road

Sidney looks behind her as the guards dead bodies lay
sprawled in the middle of the road She turns to the
door BEATING and CLAWING at it She leans back manic
and KICKS at the window with her feet No use

EXT CAMPUS DRIVE - SAME

The car makes its way down the deserted street
IN THE BACKSEAT

Sidney is beyond frantic She eyes the Ghost through

the gate She turns and twists looking for an escape
Through the window she sees approaching headlights

She SCREAMS through the closed window as a car passes
by

Sidney takes notice as the car turns onto another
campus street Big stone school buildings line each
side of a thin road

She eyes the Ghost through the rearview window The
white masks turns as hidden eyes bore through her The
Ghost hits the gas picking up speed

Sidney looks to the book bag on the seat beside her
She rips it open rustling through it frantically She
pulls books pencils paper Sid grabs a long yellow
No2 pencil She grips it hard looking to the metal
grate just behind the drivers seat The Ghosts nec
is right up against it

Sid takes the pencil and positions it right behind the
Ghosts head ready to attack

Without pause Sid RAMS the pencil through the grate
into the Ghosts neck It lodges there as the Ghost
falls forward in pain losing control of the wheel for
a moment

The car jumps the curb and SLAMS against a building
The Ghost yanks the wheel over correcting He tries to
bring it back to the road but doesnt see the lamp post
that stands directly in the cars path

The Squad car makes direct contact with the lamp post
SLAMMING into it bringing the car to a CRASHING HALT
lodging it agaisnt the buildings stone exterior

Smoke rises from a bashed engine as it emits a fatal
rumbling

INSIDE THE CAR

All is still In the backseat Sidney rises from the
floorboards She looks up to see the Ghost Masked

figure slumped over the steering wheel Out

Sid quickly pulls herself together looking about
sizing up her options She tugs on the door handle It
wont budge She looks to the passengers side of the
car Its flush against the building

Then she notices the metal grate The edge has been
pried apart in the crash Sidney reaches for it
pulling on it bending it backwards

CREAK

Sid tries to stifle the noise it makes all the while
eyeing the Ghost who remains unconscious She creates
an opening large enough for her to crawl through She
lifts herself up and pulls herself through to the

FRONT SEAT

Sid falls down into the seat her eyes never leaving
the Ghost She lay crumpled up against the smashed
passengers door the only sound is her own TERRIFIED
BREATHING She watches the Ghost Masked Figure His
body doesnt move She contemplates her next move

The only way out is through the drivers door

After what seems an eternity she slowly reaches over
with her foot and nudges the Ghost No movement
Nothing

She slides across the seat towards the Ghost moving to
his side She reaches with her hand and pushes on the
Ghosts shoulder His body moves slumping back against
the back of the seat It clears space for her to pass
through

She sits up on her feet facing the Ghost With her

leg she reaches over him straddling him She leans
against the steering wheel her arm quickly reaching
for the door knob

HONK

Her back brushes against the horn Sid TENSES her face
a little more than a foot from the Ghost Mask He
doesnt move Hes completely out cold Sid pushes the
car door open and starts to slide completely over the
Ghost when she stops

She looks to the Ghost

CLOSE ON HER FACE
As she fights with a decision Then with a fierce
determination Sid reaches for the Ghost Mask She
finds the edge and begins to peels the Mask away
when

THE GHOST COMES TO LIFE

Lunging forward Sidney SCREAMS leaping falling out
the car door

OUTSIDE THE CAR

BAM

Sid hits the pavement hard She lifts herself up when
her entire body is YANKED VIOLENTLY BACKWARDS

The Ghost has hold of her foot pulling her back into
the car Sidney KICKS and WRITHES breaking free She
hops to her feet as the Ghost emerges from the car
Sidney SLAMS the car door shut It catches the Ghost
nocking him backwards

CLOSE ON DEWEY AND GALE

GALE
Shit

Dewey spins around He reaches for the gun he no longer
carries

DEWEY
Dammit

He looks around the room up to the two levels above
them He spots a small light on the second level He
squints his eyes and sees a FIGURE standing behind it

GALE
Lets go

DEWEY
No wait here

Dewey hands her his flashlight and takes off for the
stair rise that leads to the upper level

GALE
No Dewey lets call for backup

But Dewey is gone leaving Gale alone She turns to the
monitor to see her face in fear-stricken CLOSEUP

ON THE UPPER LEVEL
Dewey moves fast limping his way to the levels edge
He approaches the railing and makes his way around to
the shining light

He reaches it finding nothing but a camera and tripod
It sits alone against the railing Dewey surveys the
second level Empty seats everywhere Completely bare

Dewey looks down to the main floor to Gale who looks
up to him
GALE
Dewey
DEWEY

Theres nothing Im coming down

Dewey turns to leave his eye catching a monitor that
hangs level with the railing On the monitor Gale is
in frame looking up at Dewey her face fear stained
She takes a step forward moving out of frame
revealing

THE GHOST

Who stands right behind her Dewey looks down to see
the Ghost standing directly behind Gale

DEWEY (CONTD)

Watch out
DOWN BELOW
Gale turns just in time to see the gleam of a killers
knife as it darts out of the darkness Gale catapults
just dodging it She moves like lightning up the aisle
of seats
UP ABOVE
Dewey races for the stairs going as fast as his
handicapped leg will allow

DOWN BELOW

Gale tears out the exit door the Killer right behind
her
AT THE LECTURN
Dewey arrives searching looking for Gale

DEWEY (CONTD)
Gale

He eyes the exit door as it slowly closes He moves for
it

INT CORRIDOR - SAME

Gale races down the hallway eyeing the nearest door
She tears it open disappearing into

INT SOUND STAGE - SAME

Gale finds herself in the student studios She stands
in a huge control booth that overlooks a dubbing stage
Lots of glass walls and doors It has a maze quality

Gale moves out a side door and into a dubbing room
Darkness everywhere Gale stops for a second listening
as she main door CREAKS open And then FOOTSTEPS are
heard making their way towards her

Gale proceeds deeper into the studio She moves into a
sound proof room and closes the door Not seeing the

GHOST FIGURE

That stands behind her She turns around and SCREAMS
She starts out but then realizes hes standing in the
control booth Shes protected by a clear large
plexiglass window that wraps around the room The ghost
moves out the side door heading her way He disappears
out of view Gale freaks She races to the door trying
to secure it Theres no lock

AT THE MAIN DOOR
Dewey slips through quietly trying his best to be

quick on his toes Through the control booth window he
immediately spots Gale

INSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM
Gale looks for objects to block the door with She
drags a shelf of sound equipment towards the door

OUTSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM
Dewey moves to the window

DEWEY
Gale Gale

She doesnt hear him The room is sound proof He BEATS
against the glass Still she doesnt turn to him

INSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM

Gale shoves everything she can find against the door
not seeing or hearing Dewey as he POUNDS against the
sound proof barrier behind her

She also doesnt see the Killer that appears behind
Dewey He moves on him swift and focused

INSIDE THE DUBBING STAGE

Gale cant take her eyes off the door Her face is
terrified If shed only turn around she would see
Dewey - his face terror stricken as a knife is hurled
into him repeatedely With each thrust blood is
splattered against the glass

IN THE CONTROL BOOTH

Dewey SCREAMS for his life caught completely off
guard He falls forward onto the control panels
Suddenly microphone feedback tears through the studios
as Deweys CRIES are heard throughout the stage

IN THE DUBBING STAGE
Deweys DEATH SCREAM rips through the room

Gale turns to the window to see Dewey his face smashed
against it blood smeared across the glass She moves
to the window her face only inches from his A moment
as their eyes meet Deweys life is near gone His eyes
reveal it
Gale BEATS against the glass window

GALE
(through tears)
NOOOOCOCON0

Deweys body slides down out of view Gale is
mortified She looks to the Killer who has already made
his way through the control booth Hes coming for her
She races to the door throws the things away

She manages to pull the door open just enough to slide
through And shes off and running

Gale finds a door and plows through it stopping only
long enough to lock it

BAM The Ghost RAMS it from the other side but it
holds Gale surveys her surroundings Shes ina
storage room She eyes another door She moves through
it and out into

THE HALLWAY

Gale shoots down it

across the yard running smack into

THE GHOST MASKED KILLER

But Sidney spins around as two Ghosts appear on each

lightning speed

Cotton up and running is close behind

INT CATWALK SAME

The catwalk sits above the open fly space where flats
and a large chandelier are stored in the air

Sid reaches the top and takes off running down to the
