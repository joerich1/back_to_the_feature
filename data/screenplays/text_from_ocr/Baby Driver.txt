EXT PARKING LOT - EARLY MORNING 1
A strip mall in the San Fernando Valley
A front wheel of a car pulls slowly into view

A curb reads ‘Short Stay 5 Mins Only’

INT CAR - CONTINUOUS 2
Play is pressed on an iPod Classic A rock track starts up
It’s very loud It’s awesome

‘Bellbottoms’ by the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion

On high strings and a guitar stab we see the driver

Young baby faced Short cropped hair He wears mostly black
Sports cheap gas station shades This is BABY

We can’t see his eyes but his blank expression seems pretty
stoic He listens to the track stares out the windshield

On a 2nd guitar stab we see a beefy (30s) tough guy in shotgun
This is GRIFF He too wears shades black business clothes

On a 3rd stab we see another black clad gentleman (40s) He’s
handsome but looks like he parties too hard This is BUDDY

On a final stab we see the last shades wearing black clad
passenger a younger lady (20s) with her hair up This is
DARLING There’s a hint of trash beneath her business clothes

The high strings crescendo Griff flings his door wide open

INT EXT CARPARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 3

The track kicks in We see the car is a shiny red Honda Civic
and note the door chimes are in time with the song

Choppy strings play against guitar riffs as GRIFF gets out We
see a shotgun partially concealed in his trench coat

BUDDY and DARLING get out We glimpse they are also armed He
pops the trunk Grabs two duffels Hands one to Darling

We see they all wear sneakers as they walk away from the car in
sync with the track Again It’s awesome But we stay with-

BABY our young driver Hands fixed on the wheel Ten to two
Watching his colleagues disappearing inside a ‘CHASE’ bank
The song pauses for two bars

When it kicks back in our driver suddenly drops the strong
silent tough guy act and comes to glorious joyous life

Nodding his head Swaying in his seat Mouthing the vocals A
slave to the rhythm He doesn’t miss a beat It’s cool but-

He’s also like a big kid in front of his bedroom mirror As he
drums on the dash we see shoppers pass other cars cruise by

Baby is so immersed in the track he flicks on the wipers They
swipe across the dry glass in perfect sync

A mother with a stroller passes The infant inside notices Baby
rocking out in his car Baby waves The infant smiles

Then he instinctively looks in his rear view A BLACK and WHITE
POLICE CRUISER sirens blaring races up the street behind
Baby turns to watch the police car drive up and past

A pause in the music The police car doesn’t return

An urgent bass line Baby looks to the bank His goofy chair
dance is over He’s stone faced and all business again

Over distorted guitars our driver watches through partially
frosted windows Sees his colleagues ordering staff to hit the
floor Glimpses scared faces the brandishing of weapons

The song reaches an interlude a vocal comes in and Baby lip
syncs every word as his eyes stay fixed on the bank

JON SPENCER (IN SONG)
“Thank you very much ladies and
gentlemen”

A snare hits An ALARM sounds Baby steels himself

Military snares build like staccato machine gun fire His
colleagues explode out of the bank two bags full

Baby revs in time with the snares as his colleagues get in Our
driver glances at the bank sign ‘CHASE’

He pops the car into reverse Stomps the gas hard
Snare drums crescendo The car screams back through the tight

spaces between parked cars makes a tight Rockford to face
forward Baby drops into drive Swerves wide onto -
EXT THE STREETS OF LA - CONTINUOUS 4

JON SPENCER
“Tm gonna daaaaance”

Baby’s car sails into busy traffic the track blasting on the
car stereo building in speed and energy

Despite the velocity of the getaway our driver is calm at the
wheel weaving through traffic like an android

The other gang members lay low in their seats shrug out of
their business attire They trade looks as Baby swerves

WOOP WOOP One BLACK and WHITE cruiser screams the opposite way
It zooms past then makes a 180 behind them

Baby sees the Black and White BEHIND A light turns red AHEAD

He FLOORS it through the stop light Other drivers break hard
around him Cars crash rear end in time with kick drum hits

The Black and White flies through the intersection gaining

Baby nears 70 mph the track building with cracking snares The
lone Black and White still dogs behind Sirens wailing

Baby HITS 70 mph Then 80 Comes up to an intersection Eases
off Makes a hard right at the last second into -

A side street Loses the Black and White Baby TEARS down the
narrow street dodges dumpsters

On the adjacent artery the Black and White can be seen in
parallel Baby floors it to the next cross street and SWERVES a
hard left directly into the path of the Black and White
pursuing

Baby plows through this intersection forcing the Black and White
and all other traffic to brake VIOLENTLY HARD

The Honda Civic leaves the Black and White in the dust and tears
down another straight with less traffic

Baby holds the gas down Sees something before we do -

JON SPENCER (CONTD)
“Tm gonna break Im gonna break

Baby brakes pulls hard on the wheel accelerates through a 180
skid roars in back the other direction with -

THREE BLACK and WHITES now on his tail Red and Blues Sirens
Facing the original cruiser Baby crosses the double line tears
past oncoming traffic and DISAPPEARS up a freeway ramp

No one saw that turn coming but Baby

EXT THE 405 FREEWAY - CONTINUOUS 5

The Black and Whites are left behind as Baby revs past the green
light and into aggressive morning traffic 85 90

Highly distorted guitar signals the arrival of a POLICE
HELICOPTER It dogs above but has to play find-the-lady with
at least three red Honda Civics currently southbound

Baby weaves from lane to lane As he disappears under a bridge
he crosses to the shoulder and barrels along it at a crazy
speed Tears down the off ramp And he’s back onto -

EXT THE STREETS OF LA - CONTINUOUS 6

MASS HONKS as Baby blows through a intersection Disappears down
an alley weaving these back routes like a savant

As sirens and choppers’ blades ebb away a little we see Baby
ease it down a rising bass riff signals a sneaking approach

He slows to see if any cruisers cross by ahead One police
cruiser glides by sirens off Baby waits on the bass riff
again Then floors it when the coast’s clear And suddenly -

They pull into a covered parking lot underneath a quiet shopping
complex and pull up next to a green Toyota Corolla

And like that the gang leap out of the Civic and into the switch
car money and guns covered up

The gang swap places Buddy and Griff in the back Baby shotgun
Darling drives Lets her hair down Pulls on a colorful sweater

Baby closes his eyes pretends to be asleep as Darling roars
into the white of morning and the Blues Explosion echoes out

And the first musical number is over That was something

EXT DOWNTOWN BUSINESS DISTRICT - LATER 7
OVER CREDITS ‘Harlem Shuffle’ by Bob and Earl

Our hero Baby appears from a door in the mirrored exterior of
a non-descript business address in Bunker Hill
Baby has his iPod earphones firmly in his shades on and his
bubble of sound around him Again he’s clearly a big kid when
away from the gang lost in his music

He strolls down the street listening to ‘Harlem Shuffle’ The song
is as funky as the business district is not Office workers stride
to work while Baby STRUTS along like Tony Manero

Baby walks against the traffic the world syncing around him a
chorus of car honks cell phones and barking canines

Baby uses a crosswalk the bleeps and his steps all in time He
reaches the other side of the street and breezes into -

INT STARBUCKS - CONTINUOUS 8
Baby takes one ear out orders from an unseen MALE BARISTA

BARISTA (05S)
Can I get your order sir

BABY
(counts out four fingers)
One black coffee One black coffee
One black coffee And one coffee
black

BARISTA (0S)
So four black coffees

BABY
Uh Yeah

BARISTA (0S)
Size

BABY
Middle one

BARISTA (0S)
Four grande black coffees Name

BABY
Baby

BARISTA (0S)
Your name is “Baby”

BABY
B-A-B-Y Baby

Baby puts his second ear back in as the coffee machine screams
into life and Bob (or Earl) wails over the middle 8

Baby looks around the Starbucks sees other young people of his
age smiling and chatting enjoying their carefree lives Their
actions are magically in time with his personal soundtrack

Baby looks out through the window sees A PRETTY GIRL walking
past She too is wearing earphones and lost in her own music

For a beautiful moment this girl and the whole damn city is
alive and all in step with the music in his head All except -

A BEAT COP Ironically the only person not walking on beat
The middle 8 ends The GIRL disappears The BEAT COP lingers

Baby grabs his coffee tray Splits

EXT DOWNTOWN BUSINESS DISTRICT - CONTINUOUS 9
Baby passes the Beat Cop only doing a subtle strut in time
His swagger returns as he approaches the building from where he
came We see POLICE CARS reflected in the glass of the
building Baby hears their sirens and watches as they pass

As the song fades Baby opens the door with his elbow stops it
with his foot all while switching the coffee tray from one

hand to the other He then pirouettes into the open door He is-

The Gene Kelly of the coffee run

INT UNDECORATED LOFT - DAY 10
‘Egyptian Reggae’ by Jonathan Richman and The Modern Lovers

Coffee is drunk Cash split The gang are in a garment
warehouse space with some vintage sewing desks

On a large table in the middle DOC an older (60s) silver-
haired very well-dressed man counts out the day’s haul

Darling fixes herself up (down) now looking trashier than
before Buddy sits next to her and sips his coffee quietly

Baby sits at the back of class earphones in and shades still
on The goofy kid has disappeared the stoic poker faced Baby
has returned The beefy guy Griff glowers at him
GRIFF
What’s his deal

DOC
Baby Full cut Same as everyone

Doc is brusque seems irritated at answering any questions

GRIFF
No I mean is he retarded
DOC
Retarded means slow Was he slow
GRIFF
No
DOC

Then he don’t sound retarded to me
Doc smiles for a second Then resumes counting
GRIFF
I don’t know There’s something wrong

with him not saying anything

DOC
There’s nothing wrong with some quiet

GRIFF
I’m just saying it weirds me -
DOC
(makes a zip-it motion)
Hey I’m going to lose count

Griff swaggers over to Baby who taps his fingers on the table
to ‘Egyptian Reggae’ on his iPod

Griff observes for a while then holds down his tapping hand
Baby slowly takes his hand away Now his feet tap in time

GRIFF
What you listening to

No answer Griff takes out one of Baby’s earphones

GRIFF (CONT’D)
What are you listening to Baby

No answer Griff looks at Baby’s iPod Drops it with a scoff
GRIFF (CONTD)
You think you’re pretty smart acting
dumb that it

BUDDY
Leave the kid alone Griff

GRIFF
I just wanna know what’s going in his
head Aside from ‘Egyptian Reggae’

DARLING
(half listening)
Love reggae

BUDDY
What does it matter to you

GRIFF
I think he thinks he’s better than us
Buddy Wants to keep his white shirt
clean while we plays dirty

Griff snatches off Baby’s shades We see Baby’s baby blues for
the first time He looks so fresh faced so young

GRIFF (CONTD)
It don’t work like that Someday
youll get blood on your hands and
find out it don’t wash off in the
fucking sink

DARLING
Griff

GRIFF
Hey Darling he wants to hang with the
older kids he’s going to hear some
grown up words Like ‘fuck’

Griff does a boo scare on Baby He doesn’t flinch

DOC
Will you cut it out

BUDDY
Yeah he did his job let him be

GRIFF
Hey I ain’t saying he’s not great
Boy’s a star right

Doc puts Baby’s cut in a holdall and brings it over to his desk
DOC
Would I vouch for him if he wasn’t

Doc leaves to go to the bathroom Griff shouts after

GRIFF
Hey I’m just checking he’s gonna be
okay out in the world You know since
he’s the only one in here not packing

Smiling Griff takes out his revolver puts it on the desk
Baby looks at the revolver but doesn’t show any emotion

GRIFF (CONT’D)
Take it There’s bad people around

BUDDY
Speak for yourself

GRIFF
Don’t want it Say I took your share

walked out How you gonna stop me I
wanna see you stop me

Darling and Buddy exchange glances as Griff playfully swipes
Baby’s holdall and walks slowly away towards the door

GRIFF (CONTD)
C’mon Don’t let me get away

Baby looks at Griff then the revolver Griff laughs

GRIFF (CONTD)
Do it Baby I’m a real bad guy

Baby looks up at the ceiling Griff is insulted

GRIFF (CONT’D)
Okay Enough games

Griff huffs reluctantly puts the money back in the holdall
Baby quietly puts his shades back on again retreats
BUDDY

I figured out why you call him Baby
Still waiting for his first words

INT FREIGHT ELEVATOR - LATER 11

‘Secondo Intermezzo Pop’ by Ennio Morricone

Baby travels with Griff Darling Buddy and Doc in a packed
elevator All five of them clutch HOLDALLS

Darling is all over Buddy Smooching and laughing (The 20 year
age gap between them is a little much)

DARLING
Well isn’t this quite the squeeze

BUDDY
I think youre quite the squeeze

Griff again eyeballs Baby who has shades back on phones in

GRIFF
You still mad-dogging me boy

Doc snaps Darling and Buddy sigh tired of this shit

DOC
Jesus You’re mad dogging him

BUDDY
Yeah where do you get off

GRIFF
Kid’s gotta grow up sometime

BUDDY
Seriously Where do you get off

PING The lift hits Pl

GRIFF
Right here

Griff makes a move looking to Doc
GRIFF (CONT’D)

Okay folks if you don’t hear from me
It’s because I’m dead

Griff exits the frame and the movie He’s never seen again

The doors close and Darling laughs at the release of tension
The lift descends Buddy and Darling kiss again

DARLING
Hey what’s that song
(sings)
“Love in an elevator”

BUDDY
That would be ‘Love In An Elevator’

DARLING
Riiight
PING The elevator hits P2 Buddy salutes Doc
BUDDY

nose bag is empty
Buddy punches Baby’s arm playfully

They exit Buddy shouts back to Baby as the doors close

BUDDY (CONT’D)

DOC

Baby then speaks his first words to any of ‘the gang’
BABY
Okay
12 INT UNDERGROUND PARKING P3 - CONTINUOUS 12

PING Baby and Doc exit into a cavernous parking lot They walk
over to Doc’s shiny Black Merc Doc opens the trunk

DOC
Now you know I don’t like taking candy
from Baby but

Doc holds out his hand Baby gives him his holdall Doc takes
out one stack of bills and throws both bags in the trunk

DOC (CONTD)
Didn’t want to embarrass you in front
of the gang When we’re square we’ll
work out a new deal Deal

BABY

EXT APARTMENT BLOCK - DUSK 13
‘Nutrocker’ by B Bumble And The Stingers

A piano bangs out a funereal intro We see a dilapidated red
brick apartment building complete with a rusty fire escape

It’s a stone’s throw from a park Judging by some of the
boarded up windows literally a stone’s throw
INT BARE APARTMENT — DUSK 14

The song becomes a rendition of March Of The Wooden Soldiers
we see Baby flick the stack of cash in time with the piano

Without his shades Baby again looks less the badass more the
big kid Young of indeterminate age Handsome but cute

As the track vamps Baby puts the money away under a missing
floorboard where an amount of dollar bills are stashed

Baby replaces the board and we get a wider view of his
quarters

Pretty basic Tiny kitchenette Small bathroom and bedroom In
the center a dining table and single chair

As ‘Nutrocker blossoms into a jazzy version of Tchaikovsky
Baby mimes the keyboards on the table Pounding out the tune
with his fingers Playing at playing like Jerry Lee Lewis

There are iPods on the counter table and floor There must be
close to 70 devices from different years different colors
different models seemingly from different owners

There isn’t a computer in the room Just the odd charger
Battered travel speakers A cassette deck Audio tapes A vinyl
player LPs CD players Walkmans Dictaphones and many other
recorders A treasure trove of music systems and physical
media

While there is a tremendous amount of equipment it’s ordered
in a way that makes sense to Baby Very precisely laid out

Baby is now jiving around the room to ‘Nutrocker’ He even pops
some pills to the tune (Sharp eyes will notice its
anticonvulsant medication for tinnitus and epilepsy)

It’s clear music is an obsession as Baby dances like no-ones
watching As he moves to the other side of the room we see -

An ELDERLY MAN (African American 80s) in pajamas and robe
sitting in a wheelchair He’s half-asleep watching TV

Baby sees a KTLA 5 report on a ‘Valley Bank Robbe - ’

CLICK Baby switches it off He wakes the Elderly Man and
communicates the following in sign language No subtitles

BABY
You okay

ELDERLY MAN
I’m hungry

BABY
Youwant the same

ELDERLY MAN
Yes please

As drums shuffle and the piano starts a descending octave Baby
makes a sliced white bread and peanut butter sandwich

He makes sure to spread the butter to the edges and cuts it
into four smaller slices Every action has a flourish to it

The song ends as it began with jolly ceremony Baby serves the
sandwich on bended knee as if it were a royal platter The
Elderly Man beams with his remaining teeth

In the corner sits one of those deaf friendly phones where a
red light flashes when a call is incoming It is not flashing

INT BARE APARTMENT - EVENING 15

Baby sits alone The Elderly Man is asleep in his chair Baby
absent mindedly flicks through kids’ TV CHANNELS

Flip to Alfala from ‘The Little Rascals’ singing -

ALFALFA
“You are so beautiful”

Flip to Donkey and several baby donkeys in ‘Shrek The 3rd’-

DONKEY
They grow up so fast

Flip to Sully and Mike in ‘Monsters Inc’-
MIKE WAZOWSKI
You and I are a team Nothing is more
important than our friendship

INT BARE APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT 16

Baby still sits alone The Elderly Man now cannot be seen He
holds an outmoded Sony handheld cassette recorder

He plays back the audio for the opening chase We hear a badly
recorded ‘Bellbottoms’ and all the sounds of the car

The phone sits in the corner Still nothing

INT BARE APARTMENT - DAWN 17
Baby Alone Still playing the tape We hear this dialogue

DOC (TAPE)
Was he slow

GRIFF (TAPE)
No

VEEEEEP Baby rewinds this Listens again

INT BARE APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING 18
‘Call Me’ by Siriusmo

Baby hasn’t slept Stares at the phone In time with a track
made up of dial tones he pretends to play it like a theremin

He mimes out this Chaplin-esque routine where he wills the
phone to ring with grand choreographed gestures

But no call Bored Baby looks into the bedroom Sees the
Elderly Man asleep under blankets Sunlight streaming in

Slowly Baby starts to fall asleep But as soon as his eyes
close-

FLASHBACK A HIGH PITCHED WHINE ON SOUNDTRACK

- A YOUNG 7 YEAR OLD Baby not wearing headphones sitting in
the same apartment same table The furnishings are different

- Young Baby has bruises and visible stitches He looks up to
see the Elderly Man (about 10 years younger) offer him a peanut
butter sandwich and mouth ‘you okay Baby closes his eyes

- See Young Baby unbruised in the back seat of a car
headphones firmly on The camera pans around to see -

- A crying woman driving

- A man in the passenger seat shouting furiously at her

- The pick up truck they are about to rear end

- The WHINE reaches a peak Baby closes his eyes

FLASHBACK ENDS Baby opens his eyes Gets out of his chair
He looks at one white iPod on the table The original model
from 2001 It is cracked and broken Beyond repair

INT BARE APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING 19
‘Intro’ by The Herbaliser

Baby’s back in his bubble Jacket on Phones in Stands by the
front door in a hallway with mirrors on both sides

THE HERBALISER
“Hes rough hes rugged hes red
blooded hes romantic Hes full of
shit”

Baby takes his shades on and off throwing looks into the
mirrors acting out tough expressions and badass poses

It’s clear Baby will not leave until the beat kicks in Baby
throws open the door and exits

INTEXT APARTMENT BLOCK - CONTINUOUS 20
To a funky groove Baby struts down the stairwell passing a
rising exposed elevator on the way up He doesn’t acknowledge
the neighbor going up as he continues his tough act sauntering
down to the front door and on beat -

He struts into the street as if he owns it Baby jumps into a
Blue Chevy Malibu As the song ends he rolls away

INT EMPTY DINER - EARLY MORNING 21
‘Let’s Go Away For Awhile’ by The Beach Boys

Baby Shades on Phones in Looking ahead Listening to music
He sits in a pleasant but not very busy old school diner

The decor is 50s retro and auto centric Classic convertibles
with happy smiling couples inside are painted everywhere

Baby sees the LA Times on the table He flips it over so he
doesn’t have to see the headline featuring ‘Robbery’

Baby looks out to see a COUPLE in a car at the lights They
seem happy living the life Baby does not They pull away
revealing-

The PRETTY GIRL from earlier

She’s outside the diner wearing grey sweats and still wearing
earphones too She appears to be singing as she -

Walks into the diner and right into the kitchen

Baby peers through the round glass of the kitchen doors as the
girl gets changed out of her sweats Still singing

Baby takes out one ear of his earphones to hear what she’s
singing But he can only hear the diner music and a little
snatch of her voice when the kitchen doors swing open

For a brief moment the planets align and Babys music the
diner muzak and her singing make glorious union

THE GIRL
B-A-B-Y Baby

Baby takes off his shades to look more clearly at this angel
but she disappears from view to finish getting changed

Baby stares at the empty space where she just was Then -

FEMALE VOICE
What can I get you this fine morning

Baby looks up in a daze It’s her She’s a waitress

BABY
Uh

THE WAITRESS
Don’t worry if you need a minute I
got all the time in the world

She gestures to the empty diner One man at the counter and a
second bored waitress Baby stares at photos on the menu

THE WAITRESS (CONT’D)
Yknow that’s the kids’ menu right

BABY
Uh Yeah

He embarrassedly flips the menu to the other side

THE WAITRESS
Hey don’t worry I get it It’s early
You need Joe to jump start your head

BABY
Joe

THE WAITRESS
Coffee

BABY
Uh No thank you

THE WAITRESS
Did you just get off

BABY
Get off

THE WAITRESS
You just starting your day or did you
just get off

BABY
I guess

The Waitress smirks at his non-answers Hearing Baby talk more
we note his speech patterns are half schoolkid and half stoner

THE WAITRESS
What do you do

BABY
I’m a driver

THE WAITRESS
Like a show-fer

BABY
A what

THE WAITRESS
You drive around important people

BABY
I guess I do

THE WAITRESS
That’s pretty cool Is it exciting

BABY
Yeah

THE WAITRESS
Anyone I’d know

BABY
I hope not

THE WAITRESS
Well aren’t you mysterious

BABY
--I don’t know

THE WAITRESS
You don’t know Ha Do you ever hit
the road just for fun

BABY
Not so much anymore

THE WAITRESS
Me neither Sometimes I’d like to just
take off Put some tunes on Not know
where I was going

BABY
Yeah

THE WAITRESS
Yeah

A long pause They drift off lose themselves in the idea

THE WAITRESS (CONT’D)
Have you decided on anything yet

BABY
Yeah
(blurts)
You are so beautiful

THE WAITRESS
Oh you just decided that Well thank
you but I’m sure you don’t mean it

BABY
I do mean it
(looks at her name tag)
Jonathan

THE WAITRESS
Oh sorry This isn’t my badge I only
just started here as a
(gestures at her uniform)

BABY
Jonathan

THE WAITRESS
Yeah as a ‘Jonathan’

She smiles Charmed at his odd manner She walks off

THE WAITRESS (CONT’D)
Well if you have any questions
holler

Baby stares as she walks off tapping the backs of diner stools
in time with the music as she goes She sings a snatch of the
song she was singing earlier in time with the muzak

THE WAITRESS (CONT’D)
B-A-B-Y Baby

Baby takes in this image of The Waitress framed within the
couples in convertible illustrations that adorn the walls

BABY
I have a question

THE WAITRESS
Uh huh

BABY
What song are you singing
INT DISCOUNT RECORD STORE - LATER 22
‘The Plot’ by Lalo Schifrin
Baby marches into a discount music store the final resting
place of physical media Zeroes in on the right section He’s

never looked so serious He flips through jewel cases Finds

BABY
Car-lah Tom-ass

We see the CD cover ‘Gee Whiz The Best Of Carla Thomas’ He
flips to the back cover Track listings ‘13 B-A-B-Y’

Pays with a crisp new 50 dollar bill And he’s out

INT BARE APARTMENT - DUSK 23
‘B-A-B-Y’ by Carla Thomas plays at full volume

Baby stands in the middle of the room Lost in the track The
Elderly Man sits in the corner again watching TV

We see a red light flashing on the phone
Baby doesn’t see it at first He mouths along with the song -

CARLA THOMAS
“And I cant stop loving you”

Baby has started a slow solo dance around the room The phone
light flashes in time with the track

CARLA THOMAS (CONTD)
“And I wont stop calling you”

The Elderly Man waves to Baby alerts him to the phone Baby
presses pause on his music and picks up

Doc (0OS)
You didn’t answer What’s up

Baby briefly glances at the ceiling puzzled

BABY
What’s up

DOC (0OS)
Baby I don’t actually need to know
Here’s what’s up
INT DISCOUNT CLOTHING - EVENING 24
‘Supervillain Theme’ by Madvillain
DOC (0OS)
I need you to drive me to an
appointment and I need you to look

smart

Over the phone conversation we see Baby in a cavernous
discount menswear store in Santee Alley garment district

It appears that we’re in the store after hours and that Doc is
very much in charge He may be the owner as he has several same
age lackeys helping Baby try out some smarter clothes
Doc (0S) (CONT’D)
You got what it takes to be a
chauffeur

BABY (0S)
I think so

DOC (0OS)
You know what a chauffeur does

BABY (0S)
Drives around important people

DOC (0S)
You learn fast kid I like it

Baby admires his new suit Doc gives it the nod too

EXTINT FANCY RESTAURANTFANCY CAR - NIGHT 25
‘Marca A La Turca’ by La Tia Leonor Y Sus Sobrinos
Baby drives Doc’s Merc up to an equally smart restaurant

It’s a final sitting for dinner not too busy Baby sees a
booth full of SERIOUS LOOKING GUYS through the window

He wears his new black suit shirt tie smart sunglasses and
driver gloves Only one earphone is in Doc sits in the back

Baby pulls into a spot A town car is parked alongside

A valet opens the door Doc leans over to Baby and whispers -

DOC
I won’t be long In case of fire
there’s something in the glove

Doc gets out leaving Baby staring at his gloves intrigued
There’s a hidden weapon in his gloves Like in ‘Iron Man’

Baby then realizes Doc meant the glove compartment He opens
that to sees a PISTOL inside He closes the glove again

He looks over to the restaurant Three WELL DRESSED TOUGHS sit
in a booth with their backs to the wall They greet Doc with
cordial hugs They look like gangsters Or ex-cops

As they talk we only see the back of Doc’s head Their
conversation cannot be heard but it syncs perfectly with the
music in Babys ears a wonky sixties cover of Mozarts Piano
Sonata in A Major

The four men discuss something important Through Baby’s eyes
their hushed talk is scored by the piano music A 4 bar melody
represents one guy talking the next 4 bars in a higher octave
represent a second guy The meeting continues in time with
descending piano scales

A piece of paper is passed to Doc across the table Baby starts
to mouth along with what he imagines the conversation to be
mimicking the facial expressions of the three toughs

As he fully commits to this silly charade the window of the
ADJACENT CAR winds down and a POKER FACED CHAUFFEUR looks
across at Baby acting like a goof

Baby stops The chaffeur then winds his window back up

Then in perfect sync with a celebratory end to the track Doc
walks out of the front door of the restaurant

Doc jumps in slams the door on the closing note of the song

DOC (CONTD)
So I got us a job You in

BABY
Am I in

DOC
It was a rhetorical question Baby
Youre in

INT UNDECORATED WAREHOUSE - DAY 26

malicious glee their jazzy patter overlapping like Altman
They talk around him at him project onto him

JD
Hum-drum huh

Baby doesn’t react to them talking about the accident He’s
distracted by one of JD’s tattoos that reads ‘Hat’

BABY
‘Hat’

JD
Uh

BABY

Your tattoo says ‘Hat’

JD
Yeah it used to say ‘hate’ but to
appease my parole officer and increase
my chances of employment I got the
‘e’ removed

JD
Who doesn’t like hats

DOC
So Let’s talk shop

INT UNDECORATED WAREHOUSE - LATER 27
‘Unsquare Dance’ by Dave Brubeck

Over a strong bass line hand claps and snare drums -

Doc relates a plan to the four strong team Some of it is
illustrated on the chalkboard We see everyone except Baby

listen as Doc relays details of masks timings routes etc

Baby sits at the back again The music in his ears fully drowns
out any dialogue But he watches their lips

There is a TOY CAR on the table next to some floorplans Baby
absent mindedly plays with it as he taps his foot

The song finishes Doc finishes Bats’ hand shoots up

BATS
I got a question Tell me why I should
believe Phones over there listened to
a damn word you just said You go
through the whole play and he ain’t
listening

DOC
Baby

BABY

You’re going to hit an armored truck
at Banco Popular in El Monte at 10am
sharp You have the details of the
route because someone at the depot has
a nasal problem The bank itself is
right by the 10 so we should be able
to hit a ramp within 60 seconds of
getting out We also have a diversion
crew who are going to blow up a bread
truck a ways away keep the fuzz busy
Dress code is Michael Myers Halloween
masks but you can’t all buy the masks
at the same time looks suspicious
You guys have the switch car all set
up but you want me to go out to the
long stay parking structure at a
Metrolink and get a ride that stays
colder for longer Boost a commuter
car a family car Something that will
blend into the morning traffic

(beat)
I think something on the heavy side
case we need to ram the police off the
road An Escalade a Yukon an
Avalanche Whatever it is it needs to
be ready for an 830 start In the
ayem

Wowed silence
DOC
That’s my Baby
INT NORTH CORONA METROLINK PARKING STRUCTURE - EARLY MORNIASand
‘Bongolia’ by The Incredible Bongo Band

On a bongo roll we see a windshield POV as we pull into a
concrete parking structure and park up in a long stay spot

Shades on ears in Baby sits in a 1989 white Toyota Camry And
waits for something better

Drums kick in Tempo shifts up The lot gets busy

On every second beat we hear a loud vibraslap and each time
Baby sizes up another car Office workers slamming car doors
and beeping keys in perfect sync with his music

We see a silver Infinti dropped off a blue Accord a green
Acura a silver SmartCar then bingo A black Avalanche

The middle aged middle management AVALANCHE OWNER beeps it
locked Then wanders out of the lot nose in the LA Times

On a drum fill Baby jumps out of his ride follows

EXT NORTH CORONA METROLINK STATION - CONTINUOUS 29

A brass riff scores Baby following the Avalanche Owner copying
his stride He follows him onto the train platform Apes his
glance to the digital timetable He even swipes a discarded
paper to look like a real commuter

When the Avalanche Owner reaches the edge of the platform Baby
stops pretending like his mark to read the LA Times too The
Avalanche Owner stops to get a coffee from a news stand Baby
does too like a weird echo of Harpo Marx

A bongo solo signals the arriving train Baby waits lining up
one door away from the Avalanche Owner They get on

The Avalanche Owner moves inside the carriage Baby does too
and KNOCKS RIGHT INTO HIM

BABY
I’m sorry

Baby then swiftly moves further down the carriage

The breakdown ends with a key change and a whistle blowing
Just before the train doors close Baby slips off again

Now a solo sax joins as Baby struts back to the parking
structure a swing in his step as the train leaves behind

The brass sounds triumphant as Baby Travoltas back into the
long stay area and right up to his prize

The Avalanche Baby walks up Whips out the OWNER’S KEYS Beep
beeps Gets in Pulls out

EXTINT BANCO POPULARAVALANCHE - LATER THAT MORNING 30

The Avalanche pulls into a strip mall lot outside the bright
red facade of a Banco Popular Parks up

Baby is still at the wheel In the back are Eddie and JD
dressed in black duds In shotgun and in black is Bats

Baby spies with his little eye a utility uniformed MARINE
walk past their car and over to a 1988 Red Toyota Pickup

The Marine eyeballs the Avalanche as he gets into his Ford but
Baby’s attention turns to another Ford the E-350 ARMORED TRUCK
which pulls up level with a side entrance to the bank

Bats breathes deep Whispers a mantra half to himself
BATS

What’s in there is ours It belongs to

us They got our money Our hard

earned paper They snuck in last night

when we was asleep took our pants off

the chair and emptied our wallet They

got what is rightfully ours So let’s

take it back What is rightfully ours
Baby hits play on an iPod plugged into the Chevy’s stereo
‘Neat Neat Neat’ by The Damned A menacing bass riff scores -
Bats Pulling on the mask from the movie ‘Halloween’
In the back Eddie also pulls on the ‘Halloween’ mask

Third up JD pulls on an ‘Austin Powers’ latex face mask

HALLOWEEN 1 (BATS)
What is that

AUSTIN POWERS (JD)
What’s what

HALLOWEEN 2 (EDDIE)
Your mask Doc said Michael Myers

AUSTIN POWERS (JD)
This is Mike Myers

HALLOWEEN 1 (BATS)
It should be the ‘Halloween’ mask

AUSTIN POWERS (JD)
This is a Halloween mask

HALLOWEEN 1 (BATS)
You’re gonna stand out

AUSTIN POWERS (JD)
From who Is everyone in this mall
wearing a Mike Myers mask too

HALLOWEEN 2 (EDDIE)
Michael Myers

AUSTIN POWERS (JD)
Whatever dude

Austin Powers goes to open his door when Baby stops them -

BABY
Wait I gotta start the song again

Baby rewinds plays the intro again The gang stare like he’s
insane When drums kick at the 5 second mark Baby points

BABY (CONTD)
Okay go

The gang jump out of the Avalanche Run over to the truck
Surprise the Hopper unloading bags from the back doors

Halloween 1 is about to cold cock the Hopper when -

Baby pulls forward a few feet blocking his view of the
violence He looks dead ahead retreats into his bubble
Chooses not to watch He lip syncs the first verse -

THE DAMNED
“Be a man can a mystery man Be a
doll be a baby doll It cant be fun
in any way There can be found no way
at all”

Then on a key change into the chorus he backs up Sees two
Halloweens and Austin Powers each with a bag running toward

Baby can see the Hopper beyond them Face down on the ground
Blood on the concrete Baby didnt want to see this Then-

Halloween 1 and 2 jump in Austin Powers lags behind a klutz
BATS
Fucking move Austin Move Use your

powers of speed

Austin (JD) finally makes it to the car And then Baby floors
it spins a perfect circle to face the exit When -

The RED PICKUP reverses into their path Blocking the exit

Baby squeals to a halt as the Marine jumps out pulls a RIFLE
and opens fire on the Avalanche Holy shit

Baby and Co Hit the deck Bullets spiderweb the windshield
Slam into reverse Scream into a J-turn

BANG The Marine takes out the rear window Glass rains down
BANG The driver of the armored truck is out and firing too
VROOM Baby floors it Escapes over a landscaped island

In his shaking rear view Baby can just see the Marine jump
back into the Red Pickup as he roars onto -

EXT VALLEY BLVD I-10 - CONTINUOUS 31
Sweating Baby speeds out of there Screams down the shoulder
Going 70 80 The gang in the car have their masks off and

slump down out of sight Bats curses

An out of control guitar solo signals the Avalanche joining the
freeway and swerving wide to occupy the far left lane

BATS
Diamond lane that shit We got four

Baby holds the gas down tearing up the far left swerving only
to overtake cars observing the speed limit

As the guitar solo goes up in register Bats sees-—

THE RED FORD PICKUP is behind and gaining Baby is boxed in by
rigs Allowing the Pickup to get close

BATS (CONTD)
Go Baby go

Right now There is nowhere to go The Pickup closes in a
determined Marine at the wheel

To the gang’s amazement The Pickup attempts the PIT maneuver
(Pursuit Immobilization Technique) tapping the back of the
Avalanche and sending the gang into a tailspin

That would be pretty crazy if not for what happens next

Still boxed in by surrounding rigs Baby spins the wheel and
turns the fishtailing Avalanche around to face front again

Nose forward Baby floors it snakes in between the rigs in a
hairy move just missing them both

It is some fancy ass driving Though Baby looks shaken

The Pickup is left on the scorching hot 10 as the Avalanche
swerves hard right and like that is gone -

EXT OFF RAMP - CONTINUOUS 32
The Avalanche glides fast down the off ramp But up ahead-

A RED LIGHT Construction Single lane traffic

The music breaks down to the solo bass line Babys car is

third back from the stop light Bats motions for them to get
out

BATS
New ride

Baby unplugs the iPod and jumps out there is a PAUSE in the
music We hear traffic sirens approach sounds of unease

Bats and Eddie stroll with their bags to the first car at the
stop A Blue Accord with a YOUNG MOTHER inside Bats taps his
pistol on the passenger window The Mother looks stunned

YOUNG MOTHER
I have a child

BATS
Get the fuck out of the car lady

Bats roughly pulls the Mother out and gets the fuck in Baby
quickly instinctively opens the back door Sees-

Her YOUNG SON on the backseat He recognises himself then
unbuckles and hands the scared kid to his mom at the roadside

BATS (CONT’D)
C’mon pussies Let’s go go go

JD is lagging again having run back to retrieve a gun from
the Avalanche Bats mutters again at the gang klutz

JD’s Austin Powers masks FALLS OFF as he races to the Accord
He quickly picks it up off the street and jumps in

BATS (CONTD)
Jesus Austin

Baby is now in the drivers seat and quickly plugs his iPod into
this car We barely miss a bar

The light turns magically green They pull out and drive to -

EXT ROSEMEAD SHOPPING CENTER - CONTINUOUS 33

Baby eases this unplanned ride into a shopping center parking
lot The GPS is going crazy (all in time with the music)

FEMALE GPS VOICE
Route recalculation

Baby glides past an oblivious Black and White that is on its way
out of the huge mall

When the cruiser is out of sight Baby swerves hard and heads
for their target a quiet access street behind a Target

They pull up next to a 2005 SILVER SATURN AURA parked in the
shadow of the morning sun

On the final chorus drums drive up the energy as our gang jump
out and slip into their third ride of the day

We’re back to something like clockwork The hi hats blending
into white noise as Baby slams into drive peels out and -
EXT UNDERGROUND PARKING P3 - LATER 34

Pulls up to a sharp stop back at Doc’s Baby got the gang out
of a mess But he is not as calm as before he’s sweating

BATS
Man up Baby
(jumps out)
And go get the fucking coffee

We hear the ‘Harlem Shuffle’ intro again But this time -

EXT DOWNTOWN BUSINESS DISTRICT - MOMENTS LATER 35
Its a cover by ‘The Foundations’ And it’s a faster tempo

Equally Baby performs his coffee run at speed But he’s not
strutting this time He’s not enjoying himself At all

INT UNDECORATED LOFT - LATER 36

Doc divides up the take in front of the gang Baby walks back
in handing out black coffees To Doc to Eddie to Bats to

Baby looks for the missing team member Doc catches it

DOC
Where’s JD

Eddie sips at his coffee Bats sits back and stretches

BATS
The International Man of Mystery

Bats lifts up the Austin Powers mask puppeteering it with two
fingers through the eyes and his thumb through the mouth

BATS (CONT’D)
Beats me

Bats grins at Baby like a naughty schoolkid

INT UNDERGROUND PARKING P3 DAY 37
PING Baby exits the elevator with Doc Both carry holdalls

Baby walks over to the Silver Aura Stares at the trunk But
doesn’t dare open it We see a SMUDGE OF BLOOD on the latch

Stay on Baby Mesmerized Horrified Doc takes Baby’s Holdall
from his hands Gives him a stack of bills in return

DOC
You’re nearly done Baby

BABY
Yeah

DOC
One more job though Lose this ride

SLAM Baby shuts the door sits in the car Alone

EXT JUNK YARD - DAY 38
A slowed down version of Carla Thomas’ ‘B-A-B-Y’ starts

Baby watches his former ride (the Aura) and former colleague
(JD) about to be destroyed in a car wrecker

A hydraulic plate presses The windows explode Baby turns
equally crushed as the song drowns out the CRUNCHING METAL

He closes his eyes
FLASHBACK A HIGH PITCHED WHINE ON SOUNDTRACK

In reverse we see the CRUNCHING METAL of a car slamming into
the back of a pick up truck Then see in reverse-

- The man shouting The crying woman driving The busy road

- We see a Young Baby sitting in an apartment we havent seen
Standing over him the Man and Woman from the previous flashback

- Eyes closed Young Baby opens a hastily wrapped gift He
opens his eyes to see a new iPod The one we saw earlier
unbroken

- Young Baby peers through a bedroom door Sees the Man and Woman
argue violently Listens to the iPod to drown out the fight

- Young Baby hides under his comforter His mother leans over
him Her mascara has run She takes out one of Babys
earphones says ‘Hey Baby’ Young Baby closes his eyes The
WHINE peaks

INT HALF EMPTY DINER — DAY 39

Baby opens his eyes He sits in his usual spot Sans shades
Retreats into a happy song (’Lalo Bossa Nova’ by Quincy Jones)

A finger clicks in front of his face She’s here His waitress

WAITRESS

see stacks of TDK D90s and TDK D30s audio tapes

has edited a conversation with Debora to say -

DEBORA (ON TAPE) (CONTD)
Sometimes I’d like to just take off

BABY (ON TAPE)

EXT US POST OFFICE WATTS - DAY 47

Doc pulls into a unremarkable strip mall that houses a post
office Construction is occurring nearby The noise is
disorienting It is hot outside Sticky Close

DOC

This place doesn’t get rolled as much
as youd think Most people get scared
off by the area But we ain’t most
people

sitting on the backseat He has his own phones in and is
plugged into his PSP He throws Baby a bored look

INT US POST OFFICE - DAY 48
Baby enters the post office An alien environment to him

It’s an impersonal space Like a bank but without couches and
complimentary coffee A security guard is present The counter
is wide open a heavy door protects the back room

Without music playing we again hear the hum in his ears It’s
an unsettling noise that accentuates Baby’s unease It is also
intensified by the whine of computers and cameras in the room

Baby cases He counts the number of cameras (three) and the
number of registers (six) There are a few (eight) customers
doing business at the (four) registers open

He mouths the numbers The Kid tugs on Baby’s leg Whispers

THE KID
No bandit glass One guard unarmed

open eight customers four employees

CLUNK The elevator doors close on Baby and Doc like a prison
cell Baby looks trapped as he and Doc go up in the world

DOC
My offer
BABY
Yes
DOC
I’m thinking about your future Are
you
BABY
I am
DOC

And I don’t offer these positions
lightly Baby You wouldn’t want me to
be offended would you

BABY
No

Doc eyeballs Baby Unsure if there’s hesitation or insolence

DOC
It’s just when I give you something
nice maybe try and help you out of
your situation and you go off day
dreaming I feel like I should go fuck
myself

Doc smiles broadly This is somehow much worse Baby takes a
breath takes his shades off and says the following

BABY
You and I are a team There is nothing
more important than our friendship

Doc is surprised and touched

DOC
Well good

CLANK The elevator reaches their floor The doors open
DOC (CONT’D)
Normally I’d introduce you to the rest
of your team But in this case you
already met

We see Baby take a big breath before walking back in

51 INT UNDECORATED LOFT - MOMENTS LATER 51

Walking through the doorway of Doc’s warehouse we see what

BATS
He’s got tinnitus A hum in his drum
that he has to drown out by playing
music all the time

DARLING
You know who else does that exact same
thing Barbra Streisand

Bats takes offense at this Stares at Darling

BATS
Do I look like a fucking guy who knows
afucking thing about Barbra fucking
Streisand

BUDDY
That’s my lady Watch your mouth

Bats just laughs Darling takes a cue to powder her nose Baby
sits on the opposite side of the room to Bats Buddy walks over

BUDDY (CONT’D)
That true You listen to music to
drown out a noise in your head

BABY
Uh Yeah And when I don’t want to
think about stuff

BUDDY
It’s an escape I get it

BABY
It gets me moving you know Music
makes everything better

BATS (0S)
Oh I am playing the violin right now

BUDDY

Knock it off

(sits continues quietly)
I used to do the same thing Used to
fool around with cars when I was a
kid Drive all night hopped up
listening to the radio I used to have a
special tape Used to have my track
My one killer track that would get me
flying You got one of those

BABY
Sure

BUDDY
What’s yours

Baby speaks phonetically Like he’s never said the title aloud

BABY
‘Bry-ton Rokk’

BUDDY
I know ‘Brighton Rock’ Queen right
My big brother used to play ‘Sheer
Heart Attack’ right through the wall
You got it on there

BABY
Not this one

Baby swaps out the iPod he has plugged in for another one in
his jacket His deep pockets have lots of devices it seems

BABY (CONTD)
This one

BUDDY
Play it

Baby finds it Plays the intro to ‘Brighton Rock’ by Queen
Buddy takes one earphone It’s a weirdly intimate image of two
men sharing one pair of earphones

We hear a fairground organ Then a chugging electric guitar
Buddy nods grins reliving his teenage rock years

Bats looks over at them both incredulous

BATS
What are you faggots listening to

BUDDY BABY
Queen Queen

BATS (CONTD)
First Streisand now Queen Are you
three going to be belting out show
tunes on the way to the job You don’t
need that shit You don’t need a score
for a score Just drive a fucking car

BUDDY
Come on You’ve been a wheel man You
never had a lucky song
BATS
A cigarette song Yes Aprés heist
with a glass of scotch Absolutely
But not on the way to a job Don’t
need any extra noise I got enough
demons making music up here

BUDDY
I believe that

Bats warms to his theme Turns his chair to face them

BATS
My old buddy wanted to pull out of a
job because of what was playing on the
radio We’re about to go in he won’t
get out of the car Why Guns and Roses’
‘Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door’ is playing
on the FM Gives him the heebs He
says we all gonna die in there

BUDDY
So you bailed on the job

BATS
Nah We did it And he was half right
He bought it I didn’t Fucking crazy

Bats jumps up now Seems to be a little coked up

BATS (CONTD)
And Ill tell you another thing

BUDDY
Can’t wait

BATS
My uncle used to be a movie nut And
we used to ride together pulling off
liquor stores He was my road dog And
he used to say we should get chase
music ready next time we get ina
chase I say like what He says get
the chase music from Bullitt He was
way into Steve McQueen not Queen And
so I goes into some record store and I
pocket me the Bullitt soundtrack And
guess what We can’t find the track
Know why There is no fucking chase
music in Bullitt It’s just the noise
of the car

(MORE )

BATS (CONTD)
So I said to my uncle that’s the only
music you need the sound of a 390 V8
in a third gear four-wheel slide
theres your music My uncle didn’t
believe me he said there’s definitely
music in the Bullitt chase and I said
yeah there is it’s VROOOOM VROOOOOOM

‘This Is Soul’ by Paul Nero

Doc relates the plan on the chalkboard Again Baby drowns this out
with incongruously jazzy music in his ears

This time Baby only half watches He looks up at the lights
blots them out with his fingers in time with the music He then
Plays with TOY CARS on the table But makes them CRASH into one
another The song ends as Doc wraps up

DOC
You get all that Baby

All eyes are on Baby to reiterate the plan But he is not as
impressive as before stuttering through the following

BABY
Uh The plan is hit this post office
You know a guy who has a

DOC
Money order machine

BABY
We get the order slips themselves and
it’s literally a license to print
money Every money order is a
potential 700 dollars each box of
money orders has 250 slips in there
That’s 175 K for every box you get

DOC
And for the icing on top

Tomorrow is the day after people get
their welfare which means there’s a
lot of their cash in there tomorrow
afternoon Plan isgo in there Get
the money orders And the cash I get
a used car as the g-ride and the
switch car is one of ours We come
back here after and uhthat’s it

You missed stuff

Baby goes red Like a child embarrassed in front of class

BUDDY
The plan is that Darling goes in

hostage put shotgun to her head

DARLING
Weve role-played this a lot

BUDDY
That gets the door open And gets us
where the money is And where the
money orders are

Cowbells play in Babys ears A bass part kicks in as -

Our foursome approach the truck and the semi-circle of black
SUVs with tinted windows In the center of this gathering
portable work lights illuminate crates covered by a tarp

Four linen suited gorillas flank the crates (we’1ll call them
FARMERS) and a more urbane man (THE BUTCHER) stands in the
middle quietly makes a list to himself

As they walk up Bats discreetly offers Baby a pistol

BATS
Take this Look serious

Baby looks at the pistol being offered Stalls on taking it

BUDDY
Is he going to need it

BATS
He needs to swagger in like he’s got
one Let ‘em know we ain’t a bunch of
pussies Darling excluded of course

DARLING
Oh please

BATS
Baby take the gun It’s not like I’m
asking you to hold my cock

Baby takes the pistol just as they come within shouting range
of the men gathered around the crates

straight at Baby with his earphones in and shades on

crates are stencilled with ‘LAPD’ On top of them is a huge
smorgasbord of GUNS AND AMMO Black gun metal gleams at them

THE BUTCHER
Tonight gentlemen ladies we have
only the finest cuts of pork Direct
from local smokehouse

On Darling ‘What’

THE BUTCHER (CONT’D)
You are experienced butchers
yourselves so as I am sure you are
aware the humble pig can be cooked
from nose to tail So I can offer you
nine cuts at the best prices in all of

The Butcher motions in turn to Berettas Smith and Wessons
Glocks Kimbers Colts Heckler and Kochs and Remingtons

So let’s dive in head first from the
jowl we have the God-sent Roman bacon
that is Guanciale Actually from the

face He drops Dead WHAT THE -

The big Farmer guys caught off guard reach for their arms
Stunned Buddy Darling and Baby hit the deck

Bats then SMOKES the nearest Farmer As his body falls Bats
rolls down next to his corpse Grabs his machine pistol

The song hits a breakdown where duelling drummers madly flail
away at each other in furious patterns as -

BRAT BRAT BRAT The remaining farmers LET RIP with their
machine pistols and shotguns at the air Bats just vacated

The syncopation of music and action is shocking and awesome

Over crates and car hoods the fire fight between Bats and the
three Farmers as the duelling drum solo intensifies each burst
of gunfire matched by a burst of drums

The noises echo around the train yard A portable light is
knocked over creating dramatic under lighting Buddy and
Darling are forced to join the violent melee

From the deck Baby has a sideways angle on a six way fight
Gunfire builds Shells drop Car windows smash

The drums on the track get louder and louder as Baby watches
his colleagues spew hot lead BRAT BRAT BRAT BRAT

One Farmer aims at Baby Baby rolls out of the way and runs
like hell He is trailed by bullets dives over a crate for
safety

The tempo peaks theres a last burst of drums and guns And -

Baby looks up The train yard is quiet again There are five
bodies on the ground that appeared to be alive seconds ago

He cannot comprehend what he has just witnessed

Bats is out of ammo Grabs a nearby clip Winks to Buddy who
strides over and goes to strike Bats with his pistol

BATS (CONTD)
What the fuck

Bats dodges and shoves Buddy right back

BATS (CONTD)
Hey I just got us some hardware

We’ve never seen Buddy this mad It’s not fun

BUDDY
You shot the gunsmiths I thought
these were your contacts

BATS
Yeah They were my contacts

Those what-ifs are dead Darling
They’re ghosts now Only way they’1ll
finger us is through a Ouija board

BUDDY
Well your name is only four letters to
spell out

BATS

Pah Bats ain’t my real name
In ‘Tequila’ a huge trill of brass sounds as -

We see one of the farmers is not dead He runs past Baby
toward one of the SUVs Bats yells at Baby who is closest

BATS (CONTD)
Don’t let him get away Baby

Baby has his gun in his hand but does not fire The farmer
jumps in the SUV Makes a break for the entrance Fuck -

Instead Bats lets rip at the fleeing vehicle Buddy and Darling
grab a shotgun and mini pistol from the dead and also unload

Baby hangs back and pointedly does not join in with the
shooting His face says everything He doesnt want this

Wailing brass furious drums and hammond organs score a barrage
of bullets that stop the escapee dead in his tracks

We hear a sustained HORN as the driver slumps on his dash

BATS (CONTD)
Baby Get us out Move

No time to argue Baby grabs another abandoned SUV as Bats
Darling and Buddy grab as many guns as they can carry

Baby starts the car In his haste one ear bud has dropped out
meaning that Bats can hear the track as he jumps in the
passenger seat with a lot of hardware in his arms

Baby waits for the others then floors it

The brass in the final bridge reaches a resounding climax as
they pass their old Cadillac Bats takes a grenade flicks the
safety and throws it into the open window

As the car goes KA-BOOM in the night Bats sings along -

looks bored and distant Then the door opens and in walks -

An intense looking Bats a grim Buddy and Darling And behind
them Baby He pointedly looks at Debora his sunglasses very
firmly on He is not smiling She’s never seemed so far away

She gets that somethings up It’s as ominous as him and Doc in
the parking lot She’s also never seen him with sunglasses on

In fact she’s never seen a booth of four people all with
sunglasses on at night It’s as weird to us as it is to her

At the booth Bats soaks up the tension Loves it

BATS

Now why you all still mad at me
BUDDY

Because you have a death wish and we

don’t

Buddy talks calmly but intensely Tears a napkin into strips
Baby and Darling are caught awkwardly in the middle

BATS
We’re all going to end up in a chair
Maybe see out your days in a lawn
chair at Holiday Villa maybe settle
with the electric one Might be just
me but the latter sounds funner

BUDDY
It’s just you You revel in bad
choices In bad luck And that’s bad
business

BATS
What’s bad luck to you are more open
doors for me So I’m gonna pick
thirteen as my lucky number and make
hay while you Hail Mary

BUDDY
Whatever you do on your own time is
fine What you do within this group
affects us all

BATS
Don’t worry Buddy I ain’t gonna mess
up I know you have noses to feed

BUDDY
Oh Because you never take drugs

Baby has been watching Debora the whole time She comes over
Senses the sour mood Plays it cool

DEBORA
Can I get you anything to drink

BATS
I think it’s Coke all around

DEBORA
Three cokes

This strikes Darling as odd She looks at Baby who stares down
at his menu When Debora leaves Bats continues

BATS
Here’s the thing You rob to support a
drug habit I take drugs to support a
robbery habit
(to Baby)
Baby boy What you do this for

Baby’s glances at Debora But says nothing

BATS (CONTD)
The cash The girls Or is it just the
smell of burning rubber

BABY

BATS
So we in agreement We’re all about
the white line fever

BUDDY

During this exchange Debora looks at Baby deeply concerned
BATS

I’m deadly serious This is my job
It’s you two who’s on vacation

BUDDY
What is that supposed to mean
BATS
Youre Wall Street right
BUDDY
Doc tell you that
BATS
Doc tells me nothing I am just

guessing

Buddy glowers Sub zero sarcasm

BUDDY
I would be fascinated to hear your
thoughts

BATS

Stop me if I’m way off But I’m thinking
you were a stockbroker maybe with a
previous fiance maybe a wife maybe
kids You’re making good money you’re
good at your work but you also play
hard And you like the wild side too
much get in too deep rack up debts
that would make even your employers
blush So either you get laid off or
someone wants to break your legs You
decide to run off maybe take your
favorite lap dancer in tow head out to
the desert and disappear into your
double life concentrate on the three
things that get you high the money the
boogaloo the sex the action Okay four
things But am I close

Buddy is still unamused Then -
DARLING

I will have you know I was a feature
dancer not a lap dancer

BATS
What’s the difference

DARLING
It means my name was on the marquee And
I could charge quadruple for dances

BATS
Well then ignore everything I said

BUDDY
You doubt my credentials

BATS
Just saying you’re on a trip right
now And maybe it’s one you’re not
coming back from Either way if
youre from Wall Street you’re already
a bigger crook than I’1l ever be

BUDDY
Two things Don’t underestimate me
And don’t ever speak ill about my
lady Or I will see red and you will
see nothing but black

Buddy is scary when angered Bats breaks into a big grin

BATS
Where did you find her Vegas Reno I
think maybe it was Morongo

DARLING
What makes you say that

BATS
‘Cause that’s where the Morons-Go

Buddy’s eyes glaze over He shifts in his seat Grips a fork
It’s fucking terrifying to see him shift Bats just laughs

happens when a man loves a woman

Debora comes over with the three Cokes

DEBORA
What can I get you to eat

BATS
These cats need a happy meal But I’m
just gonna get the check Debora

Baby sees that for the first time Debora is wearing a ‘Debora’
name tag Bats then throws an arm around Baby

BATS (CONTD)
Oh and my friend here hates this
place I think it’s okay So I wanna
ask you what’s his problem

Baby cannot look up at Debora She replies coldly

DEBORA
Maybe your friend would like to fill
out a suggestion slip and tell us how
we could improve our service

Debora puts their check on the table and leaves without looking
at Baby Darling guesses something’s up

DARLING
Are you two fucking Or you were fucking
You fucked her and didn’t call her back
Or she didn’t call Something’s up I can
definitely smell fuck in the air

Baby goes red Wants to curl up and die

Darling and Buddy leave Baby moves past Bats and sees -

Bats pull the gun from his jacket Then like lightning -

Baby GRABS Bats’ arm Firmly stops him

Bats is shocked at this action Baby has never touched him
before and now holds down Bats’ gun arm with real force

Buddy turns and sees this too He checks to see if anyone in
the diner sees what’s going on They don’t

“When something is wrong with my baby
something is wrong with me

Baby looks determined emotional Bats then breaks into another
wide grin Impressed He backs off

BATS
Be sure to tip the nice lady

Baby takes the check and goes to the counter He puts it down
and goes to exit without saying anything to Debora

Debora sees under the check folder An iPod The pink one

he’s capable of I figured if he likes to
joy ride so much we might as well make
some money from it

Turns out his dad used to work for me
way back But that kid is a better
criminal than his father ever was Baby

you are going come right back here and
apologize to me You mark my words

Baby hears this but doesn’t want to He CLOSES HIS EYES

the counter talking to a male customer Babys Dad is also

present and staring at the male customer intensely

- We then see Babys Mom in a modest recording studio She is
behind the glass and we cannot hear what she is singing

- In the studio are Babys unsmiling father and the (younger)
Elderly Man He is an engineer behind the mixing desk As
Babys Mom sings the Elderly Man turns to Baby and gives a
thumbs up

- We see Young Baby in the backseat of a car watching his Dad
hold up a gas station clerk at gunpoint

- Babys Dad dumps a bunch of CANDY BARS on the back seat

The Mom drives She cries The Dad yells

We see the car about to slam into the pick up truck-

The candy falls off the back seat So does the iPod

Buddy is waiting for him Blocking his path

BUDDY
Where you going Baby

BABY

Buddy walks to the driver’s window Baby remains very quiet

BUDDY
At 2AM That doesn’t sound too smart
Or much like you either

Look you’re a good kid I said you
shouldn’t have picked up that phone
But here you are And that’s cool if
youre really committed to the job
But if you’re in it for the buzz I
say go on your Starbucks run and don’t
come back Because bad things happen

BABY

BUDDY
Doc said your Dad was in this
business
BABY
He was

A D90 audio cassette plays in the handheld recorder Baby sits
in the middle of the room Forced to listen We can hear the
hum in his ears again underlining the tense mood

Buddy and Bats stand over him Bats has his gun out Darling
sits in the corner From the tape we hear recent dialogue

DOC (ON TAPE)
What are you worried about other than

him turning left him turning right and
him knowing when the light turns green

BATS (ON TAPE)
Him turning yellow and squealing

Bats presses stop He is deadly serious

BATS (CONTD)
Now why you go and do that

Baby stammers but is aware he needs to speak up And fast

BABY

BATS
And why do you like to record stuff
Are you the police Are you a snitch

DARLING
Didn’t Doc work with his Dad

BATS

not at how bare and simple it is

BATS
And where’s he

The Elderly Man is asleep in his chair But Bats does not
notice a person is present It looks like a big old blanket

BABY

Baby does not acknowledge the old man He walks right over to a
pile of tapes on the kitchen counter

He takes the pile of D30s Turns to Bats and softly says

Buddy and Bats stand over Baby at the tape recorder Darling

The montage that plays is a collage of almost all dialogue
weve heard so far A nonsense medley of crosscut dialogue It
builds into odd rhythms Sounding awesome but absurd

Bats presses stop Buddy shuts his eyes

BATS
What the fuck did I just listen to

BABY
Like I said I was fooling around

BATS
Did we not establish what happens when
you act the fool with me

BABY
I wasn’t acting I am one

BUDDY
Anyone you’ve worked with that’s still
alive
BATS

You two are still alive

BUDDY
I’m so honored

BATS
Lemme think about what to do while I
give the kid a ride home

Bats tucks his gun into his waistband and puts his jacket on
Baby does not like the look of this He speaks firmly

BABY
I can do this I’m driving tomorrow
I’m not retarded I’m fast I’m
driving

Buddy and Bats exchange looks

DARLING

Let him So what He recorded stuff
Big deal I was kinda hoping someone

A blue Mitsubishi Galant Baby at the wheel Eyes fixed forward
Hands ten to two Music pumping on the stereo

The gang get in Buddy and Darling in back Bats in shotgun
Bats kills the stereo Produces a coke spoon Takes a big snort
BATS

Now I’m going to make this clear You

can listen on your phones or do

whatever it is you need to do But I

Baby pulls out Heads for the ‘EXIT’

INT MITSUBISHI GALANT - DAY 72
‘Music For The Head Ballet’ by The Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band

A solo harpsichord plays a jolly fairground intro as the gang
cruises down Century Boulevard Very slowly

Baby listens to the music in his earphones as they reach the
intersection of Success Avenue And find themselves in -

Gridlock Some construction is up ahead It’s the middle of the
school run Cars slow to a stop It’s a bad time for a jam

Baby signals his indicator in sync with the 44 tempo The
track becomes a woozy waltz repeating a ‘down then up’ pattern
that goes around and around as the traffic maddens

The Galant idles in the left hand lane Baby begins to sweat
Unsure of the neighborhood The air con blasting

Bats’ cocaine seems to kick in his restlessness changing the
simpatico of action and music from being magical to menacing

Buddy taps his fingers on a seat rest in time with the music
Darling flicks through the pages of a magazine also in time
Bats cocks and uncocks his shotgun in time Baby eyes this

The whole hood is alive with incident all in time with the
track Kids shouting Angry neighbors A police helicopter

The sound of chopper blades prompts the gang to all look up
When they look back down a COP CAR is right alongside them

Their next door neighbor in the traffic jam is THE POLICE

A change of key in the track The four gang members all look
straight forward eyes fixed on the static road ahead Then -

The music resumes its woozy waltz as the gang take turns to
look at the cops The glances are furtive first then more
confident The dance of their turning heads is very surreal

As the melody accentuates the odd notes we see the cops look
back at the gang in the Galant We take in the odd magic of -

Four gang members and two cops all wearing shades trying to
inconspicuously check each other out in time with a waltz

Baby doesn’t want to see Bats slowly raising his shotgun Out
of sight of the cops but ready to fire

Then suddenly the Cop driving points right towards Bats
Bats does a ‘who me’ The Cop shakes his head Then -
POINTS at Baby Motions for him to take off his earphones
Baby does so The waltz concludes Bat smiles

BATS
Yeah Baby It’s the law

Bats makes the ‘he’s crazy’ sign to the cops about Baby The
cops get a call Switch their SIREN ON Pull out of the jam and
out of sight Everyone exhales Heart attack over For now

EXT US POST OFFICE WATTS - DAY 73
‘Intermission’ by Blur
A solo piano plays an endlessly descending melody

Baby pulls up into the strip mall The place is quiet but
everything feels bad The heat the traffic the summer
aggression in the air a rain drop on the windshield In Watts

There’s even a construction PICKUP TRUCK partly blocking their
exit steel enforced concrete poles hanging off the back Even
a novice would get spooked by this but -

Bats ignores the omens and repeats his mantra

BATS
Remember what’s in there is ours It
belongs to us They got our money
They got our money orders They got
our momma’s jewels They got our
girlfriend in there So let’s go in
get them get her Take back what is
rightfully ours

Darling opens her door It starts There’s a thunderclap
A crunchy electric guitar joins the piano Adds menace
Buddy and Bats watch Darling walk into the post office alone

Baby gets a pervasive feeling of dread A baby in a stroller
cries A chorus of honks and angry drivers are heard nearby

A bass guitar joins the sneaking melody Buddy and Bats get
out take bags from the trunk and follow Darling Baby is
distracted by an argument between two men at a bus stop

A huge thunder clap and cymbal crash heralds the introduction
of drums And also Buddy and Bats entering the post office

The tempo of the track quickens Traffic noise flares nearby
Baby stares forward Rain spots his windshield

Baby hits the wipers They are in perfect time with the track
He stays fixed forward staring at the jagged mess of
protruding poles fixating on this premonition of doom

Tempo quickens Rain thickens Baby flicks the wipers up a
notch in speed In his wing mirror Baby sees -

A SECURITY GUARD ambling around the corner Looks up at the
uncommon rainfall Finishes off a sandwich

A squeal of feedback Baby looks through the post office door
He can see frantic activity inside

He looks back to the security guard who has thrown the sandwich
wrapper in the trash and now slowly approaches Baby

The tempo quickens The drums become more manic Baby flicks

the wipers to go one faster Matching the tempo The security
guard passes eyeballing Baby Then -

A GUN SHOT From inside Baby and the Guard look to the door

Baby doesn’t want to think what just happened in there The
Guard runs to the door of the post office Just as -

Buddy Darling and Bats run out bags and guns in hand
Hard cymbals strike White noise guitar Madly fast piano
The Security Guard reaches for a walkie

BATS BLOWS HIM AWAY WITH A SHOTGUN POINT BLANK

Baby witnesses this Close up He is in total shock

BATS THEN SHOOTS THE SECURITY GUARD ON THE GROUND TOO

Sound EXPLODES around them AN ALARM SCREAMS from passersby
The sound of distant SIRENS as -

Darling and Buddy leap in the back and Bats jumps in shotgun
A huge shift up in tempo the track threatening to collapse

Concrete dust and radiator mist cloud the trashed Galant

Buddy pulls Darling out of the car Baby gets out too He has
one earbud hanging out of his ear one sunglass lens missing

The song whites out Returns to a simple solo piano Buddy
looks at Baby He is incandescent with rage

Buddy FLIPS Grabs Baby Looks ready to shoot him there and
then Baby’s ear bud falls out When -

POP POP POP A COP is positioned on the street Shooting over
the hood of the first Black and White to arrive

BUDDY RETURNS FIRE from behind his car door Darling too Baby
ducks down behind the wreck of the Galant He does not know
what to do and looks again to his music for direction

He puts his left earbud back in as a new track kicks off -

‘Hocus Pocus’ by Focus

A heavy guitar riff plays in left channel Baby puts in his
right earbud A second guitar joins in the right channel

Police cars screech into view all around Officers screaming
with fury at them to lay down their arms

The track builds Baby stands The track kicks in

Baby Buddy Darling Run for it Race to survive

Driving guitars bass and drums propel Baby forward Buddy
fires back Darling loses her heels runs barefoot

EXT THE STREETS OF WATTS - CONTINUOUS 74
The three of them disappear out of the back of the strip mall
Ducking into to a back alley The sound of police boots and
screeching tires gaining on them

They pound along the alley Baby is first looking crazy with
his single lens sunglasses He vaults over a chain link fence

and runs fast leaving Darling and Buddy behind

He sails across a street cars screeching around him Heads for
a memorial park up ahead Feet pounding

Guitars build Baby runs fast and is out of control He slams
into a middle aged male DOG WALKER on a snare hit

Drum solo Baby hides in a clump of trees Stops Catches his
breath His organs feel like they are in his mouth

Vocal section Crazy yodelling Hammond Organ Baby looks
around Sees the police chasing Buddy and Darling on foot
Black and Whites splitting every which way Circling the park

The vocalist begins a rising scream Baby gears up Knows he
cannot stop Police are coming Chopper blades are closing in
The dog walker is waving in the direction of the trees

Drum fill into driving heavy guitar Baby makes a break Heads
back into the sun Cops are suddenly on his heels One Black and
White driving onto the park itself

Baby runs Cops won’t shoot There are too many people in the
park Kids scream Mothers yell Hobos are tripped over

Hectic drum fills and snares build Baby hotfoots it across a
crosswalk weaving through shoppers as he heads for a -

INTEXT RUNDOWN MALL - CONTINUOUS 75

Baby slides down banisters into the sunken ground level of a
busy-ish shopping mall that has seen better days

Another crazed drum solo signals his fast descent down the
stairs and mad dash right into a customer elevator going up

More crazy yodelling scores his ascent to a higher level Baby

catches his breath in an elevator full of women Baby looks out
of place panting and sweat drenched He takes off his cyclops

sunglasses to look less odd It doesn’t work

As the vocal rises Baby can see the Cops sweeping the food
court At the peak one cop sees Baby in the elevator The lift
doors open Baby is out of there

A frenzied guitar solo sees Baby tear around the top floor He
can see cops running up escalators to find him He tries to
fast walk so as not to look conspicuous He darts into a -

Baby takes out his ears Grabs a baseball cap and disappears
into aisles stacked with clothes The track plays faintly in
his loose earphones and mixes with the store muzak Baby tries
on a denim jacket Picks up new shades Sees -

Cops reflected in the convex mirror high up on the wall

Baby avoids them and walks straight back out The tags on his
stolen clothing set off the store alarms The cops turn to see -

Baby has gone He has disappeared into a nearby -

INT ELECTRONICS STORE - CONTINUOUS 77

Baby crouches down on the floor of a low rent Best Buy style
store He pretends to inspect a particular stereo system

One ear bud is back in and the track’s crazy oompah breakdown
mixes with the disorienting noise of many plasma screens

Outside Baby sees the cops run past the store Their path takes
his easily distracted eye to a display of televisions

Playing on the screens is a scene from ‘Top Hat’ where FRED
ASTAIRE tap dances and mimes the massacre of the chorus with
his cane a substitute for a submachine gun

All danger briefly fades as Astaire dancing syncs up with
Baby’s music The TVs are placed next to mirrored pillars
Creating a kaleidoscopic effect that mesmerizes

It’s fleeting The cops are back Breakdown is over

The huge guitar riff returns and Baby runs through the store
heading not for the exit but for the staff room He busts
through their stock room and past yelling employees to find -

next set of stairs He recovers with a limp Escapes to -

EXT RUNDOWN MALL PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 79

Baby races into the full lot shaking off his new injury

He zeroes in on models of cars from the pre-immobilizer era
Spots a 91 Accord a 95 Civic a 2003 Corolla

As the cops burst into the parking lot Baby disappears down
amongst the parked cars out of their view

While on the ground he tries the doors of the nearest
vehicles Then right in front on him

Cops Run past on foot Missing him

Baby stands up and on the rising guitar chords smashes at the
window of the nearest white Corolla with his elbow

CRASH Baby messily smashes the window He opens the door and
sits in the glass as a hectic drum solo plays

He tries to hot wire it But the engine won’t kick over

He slumps down in his seat Cops are running back and forth
The rising vocal section builds Hits a peak

The engine fires up and Baby LURCHES forward His seat belt
alarm chimes as he pulls a tight 90 degree turn Cops spot him
Some fire Sending other shoppers screaming

Baby roars forward in the Corolla clipping trolleys and non-
compacts as he goes His wheels SCREAM as he settles into the
new car and turns perfect corners to get out of this maze

As two guitars rapidly solo Baby leaves the cops behind
snaking through the lot when -

BOOM He ploughs hard into a car that is reversing at speed
It’s a grey Silverado with broken windows In the front -

BUDDY AND DARLING No fucking way

BUDDY
No fucking way

Cops descending Both Baby and Buddy try to get their cars
started again Buddy’s ride is fucked It’s not happening

Buddy SCREAMS at Baby The veins in his neck bulging

BUDDY (CONTD)
Are you a fucking jinx you maggot

The crazy vocals rise again Sirens are getting close Buddy
and Darling jump out of their car Move toward Baby’s

DARLING
Get us out of here Baby This is your
fucking mess
An LAPD bullhorn barks for them to put down their -
BRAT BRAT BRAT Darling lets rip in the bullhorn’s direction

Buddy is about to fire too when return fire EXPLODES from
three cops using nearby parked cars as a blockade

Buddy ducks but DARLING IS HIT And HIT And HIT And HIT

Baby is still in the car and can see two things

1) DARLING’S BODY RIDDLED WITH BULLETS AND JERKING WILDLY
2) BUDDY’S FACE TURNING EXPRESSIONLESS EYES SEEING RED

The bullets stop Darling drops DEAD The bullhorn resumes -

LAPD
Put your guns dow -

Nope Buddy strides around the car and walks directly TOWARDS
the cops firing all the way He is a man possessed

He wastes the police who are in the way Fearlessly walking
toward the cops shooting with fire in his eyes

Three cops are WASTED in Buddy’s vengeance He then shoots the
officer with the bullhorn who is back by a squad car

What few pedestrians are still in the lot are crying and
shrieking Massed sirens More cops coming and fast

The insane pounding guitars still ring in Baby’s ears He stays
in the driving seat waiting for Buddy’s next move

He watches as Buddy calmly walks toward him fixes him with
dead eyes RAISES HIS GUN AND OPENS FIRE

Baby slips down in his seat Pops into reverse blindly His car
barrels backwards as Buddy unloads bullets

A final drum solo plays as his Corolla slams into some parked
cars and he rolls out on to the tarmac

His sunglasses and iPod scatter on the floor as he crawls in
between some parked cars

Buddy approaches barking madly in between each shot

BUDDY
You-should-have-never-picked-up

Baby needs the iPod desperately but cannot reach it without
exposing himself to Buddy’s hail of bullets so -

Baby grabs the revolver of a downed officer RETURNS FIRE

Buddy dodges behind Baby’s crashed car genuinely not expecting
fire from Baby But he’s not surprised to see -

BABY’S HAND Reaching out Trying to grab the dropped iPod

Buddy unleashes lead and BLOWS THE iPOD TO SMITHEREENS
End of Song Then-

Baby RUNS for it zig zagging through the parked cars His only
rhythm now the sound of police sirens WOOP WOOPING

He runs turns corners sprints frantically trying to escape
the parking lot and get far away from Buddy and the cops

EXT BACK ON THE STREETS OF WATTS - CONTINUOUS 80
We stay with Baby as he sprints through back alleys The sirens
and firing sounds fall away and the sound of blood in Babys

eardrums gets louder and louder

Baby swaps his gun between hands and presses on his neck
taking his pulse It beats fast He runs fast Very fast

Baby closes his eyes and lets his pulse guide him as he runs

The sirens fall away the commotion behind him now We stay with
him running his blood racing his pulse quick

Then slows on the corner of a quieter neighborhood street

He sees an OLDER LADY slowly driving a Purple Pontiac Grand Am
Coupe She appears to be listening to a religious radio station

Desperate Baby runs up to her gun underneath his jacket and in
a voice like we’ve never heard from him -

BABY
Get the fuck out of the car lady

Baby channels the (now deceased) Bats The Older Lady freaks

She gets the fuck out and we FOLLOW HER as she runs across the
street and over the low wall of a nearby lot

She decides to stay low on the ground hide Then as her
breathing calms she hears something curious -

THE SOUND OF SWITCHING STATIONS Her car appears to still be
idling She hasn’t heard it leave But she does hear -

A ballad A dry news report A country ballad Traditional
Mexican music Another ballad Another ballad A slow soul
track A commercial Another ballad

The Lady looks over the wall and sees Baby still in the Pontiac
trying to find the correct song on the radio to drive off

She looks at him dumbstruck He looks at the car stereo fully
concentrating on his search for tempo

The final insult is Laurie Anderson’s ‘Oh Superman’ As this
super slow avant garde piece plays Baby looks up and meets
eyes with the Lady for a second Then he says-

needle on the track he needs ‘Edwin Starr’s S0S’

He then wheels the Elderly Man into the center of the room He
rips out the floorboard and stuffs as many dollars into the
Elderly Man’s gown and blanket as possible

Hello My name is Joseph I like
watching TV and sometimes I like to
listen to old records through the

vibrations I also like frozen peas

meatloaf and white bread and peanut

butter And bananas Please look after

me Thank you

Baby puts the Dictaphone in Joseph’s lap He is now awake and

smiling back at Baby It’s bittersweet

Baby bottles his guilt Runs up the path The
pings in his wake Joseph is not sure if Baby

‘open door’ chime
has gone

But Baby returns Standing outside the car with another
wheelchair he has seemingly stolen from the home

Joseph signs to Baby And for once subtitles

JOSEPH
Where are you going

BABY
Away

Baby wheels Joseph down the path to the entrance

JOSEPH
Will you come back

BABY
Idon’t know I want you to be safe

JOSEPH
Are you in trouble

BABY
Idon’t want to be in trouble anymore

The sound of CHOPPER BLADES Baby and Joseph look up as a
police searchlight illuminates the Sentra in the driveway

The spotlight then illuminates Joseph alone in his wheelchair

No Baby

EXT THE SUBURBS - EVENING 87
Hi hat drums Baby walks the dark streets Past parked cars

A kik drum hits Baby stops A cop car cruises through a cross
street up ahead

A discordant violin drone The police helicopter is still up
above Getting closer

Heavy breaths A bass guitar joins the kik hits A young female
dog walker strolls in the opposite direction

Violins climb Baby tries every car door he passes The cop car
slows shining a torch at him The searchlight comes close The
dog walker gives Baby a long double take When -

One car door is unlocked Baby opens it Slips in Boosts it A
downwards piano glissando takes us to -

EXT HALF EMPTY DINER - NIGHT 88

‘Never Never Gonna Give You Up’ by Barry White

The welcoming neon lights of the diner reflect on Baby’s
windshield as he pulls up to the shuffling groove

As Barry sings ‘ooh baby our Baby looks determined as he
parks up right outside the doors of the diner

Harpischords and high strings score his immediate view Debora
Behind the counter Looking unhappy

Baby’s heart beats with the electric bass on the track As
Barry breathes Baby takes deep breaths Whispers to himself -

BABY
Go in and get her Go in Get her

INT HALF EMPTY DINER - NIGHT 89

Baby walks in Takes his shades off Leaves his earphones in
Debora sees him Looks surprised to see him

BARRY WHITE
Wherever wherever girl Ill do it
Forever and ever yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ill see you through it

Once again Debora is framed beautifully amongst the wall art
of couples in convertibles auto dreams of romantic escape

Baby smiles Debora doesn’t match it She looks worried And
unsure of him Then Baby sees on the counter in front of her

A half drunk coffee A torn napkin The missing page from his
address book With Docs number and Deboras name on it

Debora looks at Baby with fresh eyes Like she doesn’t know him
at all And she looks scared She says quietly

DEBORA
Your buddy is here

She looks to the rest room Baby follows her gaze
BUDDY stands outside the rest room door His eyes are black He
seems like he’s in monochrome grief and rage making him a

scary shell of his former self

Aside from the three of them the diner is empty With Barry
White still playing this quiet stand off feels operatic

A flute flourish Baby and Buddy stand still No one makes a
move Buddy stares right through his former colleague

Debora breathing fast Looks between them then to the TV

On the wall mounted TV THE NEWS There’s photos and full names
for Bats (Leo Brubaker III) and Darling (Monica Rosen)

For Buddy a photo a full name and an angle (James Patrick
Morgan ‘Former Wall Street Trader Wanted For Cop Killings’)

Baby only has a sketchy artist’s rendering of his face
Buddy and Baby fixate on the news coverage when -

RED AND BLUE LIGHTS reflect on the diner windows COP CARS
CIRCLE One cruises in Parks right next to Baby’s car

Buddy calmly walks back to his spot at the counter Baby slowly
joins him They sit on stools next to each other

Outside One cop stays by the car on the radio the other
officer moves slowly towards the diner doors Buddy shows
Debora his gun over the counter and nods to her

She nods back and pours Buddy some more coffee As Debora
pours Baby makes eye contact with her as Barry sings

BARRY WHITE
“Cause I found what the world is
searching for Here right here my
dear I dont have to look no more

Baby looks emotional Debora can tell that he is upset Baby
picks up a pen and a suggestion slip writes something in his
childish scrawl She tries to read it upside down when -

THE COP walks in Doesn’t see the TV waves to Debora heads
for the mens’ The song strings build to a chorus where -

Buddy takes one of Babys earphones and listens in too -
BARRY WHITE (CONTD)
“Never never gonna give you up Im

never ever gonna stop”

Buddy fixes Baby with intent a seething fury This is not
about the girl anymore This is about settling a score

BARRY WHITE (CONTD)
“Im never ever gonna quit Cause
quittin’ just aint my schtick”

In the middle of this pop standoff Debora breathes fast

BARRY WHITE (CONTD)
“Gonna stay right here with you-”

THE SONG STOPS Baby sees that the iPod reads ‘Error 1407’

BUDDY
It’s dead Baby

The door to the rest rooms opens All three turn to see -

The OTHER WAITRESS comes out Clearly starting her shift She
yawns Doesn’t clock that anything is wrong

OTHER WAITRESS
How you two doin’

On Buddy “Two” He swivels on his stool Baby is gone

So is the piece of paper with Doc’s number Debora sees the
suggestion slip left behind On it -

“SORRY”

Buddy bolts after him into the parking lot He can’t see Baby
or his car The Pacific Ghost is gone

The cop still on his radio looks up as Buddy screams out

BUDDY
You can’t keep on running Baby

The cop wonders who this crazy man yelling is -

COP
Sir

Buddy calmly turns to him raises his pistol BLAM

INTEXT CALLBOX PARK - NIGHT 90
“3108045898”

Baby punches the number into a call box phone He’s in the park
near his old apartment block That area is cordoned and
swarming with cops As the phone rings he looks at his
immediate environment It’s populated by the homeless and kids
looking to get high The summer air thick with noise

Snatches of unfamiliar music Car alarms Partying The still
omnipresent sound of nearby chopper blades

Baby wants out The phone picks up at the other end

DOC (0S)
I ain’t open

BABY
It’s Baby

DOC (0S)
I know I ain’t open

BABY

INTEXT PHONE BOXDOC’S - NIGHT 91
Doc laughs incredulous He shakes his head

DOC
It don’t work like that You got
another debt now One you can’t pay
off You think the cops are gonna take
a check Think that Buddy has a figure
in mind that can replace Darling None
of this is going to go away because
you don’t wanna play anymore Whether
you pulled the trigger or not cops
are dead You are not going to get
cuffed they are going to kill you
Whether you shot her or not someone’s
girl is dead He is not going to
forget it

BABY
Doc you gotta understand-

DOC

‘Monsters Inc’ kid Yeah I figured
that one out It’s one of Samm’s
favorites I thought it sounded
familiar you little shit

BABY

DOC
You there

BABY
I’m scared Doc I fucked up

Doc softens He’s alone in the warehouse His jacket is on

DOC

I know you did I know you did

(beat)
Look the cops are not going anywhere
and I don’t think it’s in you to take
Buddy’s wind so the only good news is
you like driving Because you’re going
to have to hit the gas and not take
your foot off for 20 years

BABY
Yeah

DOC
Listen I’m shutting up shop And real
soon Too much bad business Not my
style But I think I can help you So
here’s what we are going to do -

A noise off Doc’s manner suddenly changes

DOC (CONTD)

Youre going to go to the florist’s
first thing tomorrow and you’re gonna
drop off the flowers to my mother Big
arrangement I don’t know all the names
whatever you think looks good Get them
to her before ten She’s gotta go out

What Baby is confused on his end of the phone
DOC (CONTD)
Card should read ‘Congratulations on
this special day All my love your
favorite son Harry’

On Doc’s end we see out of focus behind BUDDY

DOC (CONT’D)
Any problems You got my number

Doc hangs up Senses someone behind him Plays it cool Turns
to see the ashen faced dangerous Buddy

BUDDY
Where is he
DOC
Who Baby

BUDDY
Don’t fuck around Doc Where is he

DOC
You think I know where he is He could
be anywhere

BUDDY
He could be But’s he not The kid
ain’t that bright I don’t think he
knows where to go apart from his
place that diner or here

DOC
You saw him last not me

BUDDY
You put him on our score Doc Him and
that ticking timebomb Bats I took your
fucking word for them Darling took your
fucking word for them Your
recommendation So I am going to
recommend you tell me where Baby is
because whether it’s your fucking
mother’s birthday or not I don’t think
you want to see her cry tomorrow

DOC

(calm strong)
I know that you’re hurting And I know
that you want to kill Baby Maybe you
think killing him will fill that hole
inside you That you can mend your
bleeding heart by stopping his And you
want me to help you do it But I ain’t
going to do that Buddy Because I am not
your doctor Even though my name is Doc

Buddy looks at him unblinking

BUDDY
So that’s that

DOC
Yeah That’s that

92 EXT PARK - NIGHT 92

Baby sits on a low wall deciphering that last phone call He
has a portable cassette player and rewinds Doc’s command

DOC (ON TAPE)
Youre going to go to the florists
first thing tomorrow and youre gonna
drop off the flowers to my mother
(rewind)
Youre going to go to the florists
first thing tomorrow
(rewind)
Youre going to go to the florists-

Baby stops the tape It makes no sense to him He looks around
him The world feels so alien without music

He sees the auto reverse button He pushes it The tape flips
He hears from way earlier

NICE LADY TELLER (ON TAPE)
It would be nice to get away With all
this heat
VEEP Baby rewinds it Listens again Suddenly it becomes clear
Baby looks at the money the gun the bag And suddenly hears -
‘Theme From Shaft’ by Isaac Hayes

It’s in his head telling him to get up and get out

Baby looks determined He then realizes that it’s not in his
head Nor is it Isaac Hayes He looks up to see -

A red tricked out 2012 Ford Mustang V6 Premium driven by Black
GANGBANGERS pulls up near Baby

They listen to the Shaft sampling- ‘Know How’ by Young MC

One would not normally fuck with these guys but the music moves
Baby to stand up walk over and order them to -

BABY
Get out

The young Gangbangers look up Laugh at this white kid

BABY (CONTD)
Get out of the car

They look at his hands One is firmly in his jacket pocket

GANG 1
Better be good with that gun homey
Baby pulls out the gun from his pocket Shows it

BABY
I am

GANG 2
Might be the last car you steal

BABY
Don’t wanna steal it I wanna buy it

More of them laugh at this Baby points the gun firmly

BABY (CONTD)
I’m serious Sell me your car

Uh okay The laughter is more muted as Baby forces them out at
gunpoint They slowly leave the Mustang hands aloft

As Baby gets to the driver’s door he tosses a huge stack of
bills to the original owner His friend wows at the amount

GANG 2
This some crazy ass shit

Baby goes to reverse out when the driver shouts -

GANG 1
Yo yo Can I get my iPhone

The driver reaches inside Baby points the gun at him

BABY
No

Baby reverses out of there as YOUNG MC steps up to the mic

YOUNG MC
“Some of the busiest rhymes ever made
by man Are goin into this mic
written by this hand Are comin out
of this mouth made by this tongue
Ill tell you now my name my name is

MONTAGE ‘Know How’ by Young MC
- See Baby driving down LA STREETS powered by the music

- See Baby pull into a RECORD STORE

- See him stride as if his life depends on it It kinda does
YOUNG MC (CONTD)
“Pullin out rhymes like books off the
shelf - “

- Baby walks right up to the ‘Q’ section Takes Queens ‘Sheer
Heart Attack off the rack

Then sees Quincy Jones’ ‘Big Band Bossa Nova’ He swipes both
Pays with a crisp 100 dollar bill
EXT DOWNTOWN STREETS - NIGHT 93

Baby drives through the eerily dead business sector

INT UNDERGROUND PARKING P3 - NIGHT 94

Baby parking the Mustang in his usual spot The parking lot is
mostly empty Save a couple of cars

‘Know How’ scores Babys swagger to the elevator He has shades
on ears in and he’s ready for whatever is next -

INT UNDECORATED LOFT - NIGHT 95
The warehouse door is open Baby walks in He sees-

DOC IS DEAD Shirt soaked in blood Lying in an ignominious
ungraceful heap on the floor

Baby stops the music and stares We hear the hum of his
tinnitus He also sees the chalkboard It has been wiped blank
INT FREIGHT ELEVATOR - NIGHT 96
Baby descends in the elevator He is slumped against the side
His body language meek He is all alone But not for long-

INT UNDERGROUND PARKING P3 - NIGHT 97
PING Outside the elevator between him and his car are -
THREE FARMERS

No longer ghosts Suddenly very alive Baby cannot process that
these men are far from dead Is he dreaming

They are bruised tired and phenomenally pissed The thick
necked gorilla that is Armie walks toward Baby

ARMIE
Hey little pig

BABY
Are you ghosts

ARMIE
It’s called Kevlar Look it up

Armie faces Baby breathing very hard right in his face

ARMIE (CONTD)
What you listening to

BABY
Nothing

Armie slaps Baby very hard in the ear Knocking one earbud out

ARMIE
Good Because I want you to listen
very carefully to me -

Baby can now hear something faintly in the background A
fairground organ Is he dreaming

ARMIE (CONTD)
Where are your friends

Baby is slightly distracted by the faint fairground ambience in
the background He knows this song

BABY
They are not my friends But two are
dead The other I don’t know

ARMIE
Well you better rack your brains
before we stomp on them

Baby hears a chugging electric guitar He knows this song So do
we It’s ‘Brighton Rock’ by Queen and it’s playing right now

BABY
I didn’t shoot at you

ARMIE
You stood by while the blood of our
colleagues was spilt That’s red ink
for you my friend

Baby glances to the side There’s a Dodge Charger nearby Engine
running Stereo on Playing ‘Brighton Rock’

BABY
I didn’t want them to get hurt

ARMIE
This is falling on deaf ears Just
tell us where your colleague is

BABY
I think that’s him Right there

Baby points to the Charger Armie and the Butchers turn We see -
Buddy In the Charger Turning ‘Brighton Rock’ way up

And on a drum fill he hits the gas HARD

Charges the Farmers Listening to Queen

They reach for their weapons get off some shots before -

CRUNCH Buddy mows down two of the three Farmers

KILLS THEM DEAD For real this time Baby and Armie are left
standing and shocked

Armie pops off a couple of shots at Buddy as he slams the
Charger in reverse and speeds backwards to line up with Armie
Baby and the elevator He looks insane at the wheel

Armie grabs Baby and points his gun at the kid’s head

BABY (CONTD)
He wants me dead too

Armie believes him FUCK
Buddy punches the gas and tears toward Baby and Armie

Guitars descend into a bridge Buddy ploughs into the wall Baby
makes it into the freight elevator Armie doesn’t

He is pinned between Charger and wall Baby cowers in the
elevator behind and looks over the throbbing hood to see Buddy
at the wheel Grooving to Queen like a crazy man

As snare drums accelerate into a second verse Baby pulls out
his gun Buddy slams into reverse again

Baby fires at Buddy as he screams backwards He hits the
windshield a couple of times but then -

Baby’s out And Buddy is back in drive Charging at Baby As
harmonized guitars wail Buddy bears down on Baby

But instead of retreating further back he runs out of the
elevator and TOWARDS the Charger -

FREDDIE MERCURY
It would be of no small avail to talk
of magic in the air

Just as Buddy is about to CRASH INTO BABY and the wall behind
the kid RUNS AND JUMPS ON TO THE HOOD OF THE CAR

That’s some Jackie Chan shit right there

Buddy CRUNCHES into the wall as Baby slips over the roof and
nimbly sprints in the other direction to his car

Buddy can’t believe it He reverses out as Baby makes it back
to his Mustang jumping back in

Buddy spins around His car is now pretty gnarled up

He looks to see Baby back in his Mustang Back at the wheel
Back in the driver’s seat But -

Baby needs something important first As he guns his engine he
grabs the CD of Queens ‘Sheer Heart Attack’ It is still
wrapped in plastic He tries to tear it open with his teeth

Buddy senses a pause and floors his fucked up Charger to ram
the Mustang in time with the driving Queen chords

Baby is still trying to unwrap the damn CD with his teeth He
guns the engine and slams into reverse Hits the gas

Buddy chases the reversing Baby across the parking lot Baby
still unwrapping with one free hand the other on the wheel

Baby gets the cellophane off But there’s still the annoying
plastic label sealing the case Behind Baby -

A concrete pillar looms FAST in the back up camera Baby snakes
the Mustang missing the pillar

On a huge G chord Buddy hits the pillar BOOM

As Brian May flourishes Baby spins the car 180 fast He also
has the first plastic label off He faces Buddy again

Buddy slams back out from the pillar Swerves to charge

Baby starting picking off the other label and reverses again
driving one handed to a crazy guitar solo He snakes it once
more leading Buddy directly into the Farmer’s SUV

SLAM As Buddy smashes into the SUV Baby pulls another 180 on
the concrete burning as Brian May melts his fretboard

Baby now has the CD out and pops it into the player

As Buddy unwraps his Charger from the SUV Baby fast forwards
his copy of ‘Brighton Rock so it is in sync with Buddy

Buddy can see and hear Baby doing this and cannot believe it
He’s trying to get his killer track playing at the same time
Two hard bitten criminals with duelling cars and stereos

Buddy pops backwards fast but Baby with one hand on his
stereo slams into drive gunning hard as guitars wail

BOOM Baby clips the Charger on the nose Buddy is spun like a
bumper car He comes to a stop Strains to see Baby behind

He pulls back to find Baby circling around him like a shark As
Queen play elaborate drum fills Buddy’s Charger dances with
the Mustang to get distance The kid’s showing off

Baby still fast forwards through ‘Brighton Rock’ on his stereo
as he pulls out of the circle and charges forward

A whammy bar holds a growling low note Baby pulling another
bootleggers turn so that he faces Buddy again He’s now in sync
with his stereo and he has the hint of a cocky smile

Two cars two stereos one track The tempo shoots up Buddy
floors it Charges Baby Baby doesn’t move at first but -

As hi hats kick up the pace he suddenly reverses screaming
out of P3 and up the winding slope of the access ramp

Over pounding guitars Baby reverses faster than you would
drive forwards He doesn’t look up uses only the back up
camera Glances to see Buddy furiously trying to keep pace

They circle around the winding ramp screeching tires echo in
the structure and mix in with the ferocious guitars

Past P2 Baby keeps ascending in reverse at crazy speeds
Buddy struggles to keep up Gunning his fucked up Charger
Baby gets ahead of the curve Buddy can no longer see him until

he explodes into Pl There are more cars on this level
Abandoned overnight

Down the aisle Baby’s Mustang executes another amazing
Rockford turn spinning a tight 180 and facing forward
Buddy guns it and chases when on another whammy bar note -

WHAM Baby’s Mustang goes right into the wall Partially
smashes the barrier that separates from a steep drop to P2

Buddy slows WHAT THE FUCK He pulls up to the crashed Mustang -
But Baby is not inside The song is still playing Then -

As chugging guitars return we see a figure run past in the
background Buddy catches it too That Fucking Kid

As the solo guitar chugs low and lower Buddy reverses up
looking between the parked cars to see if he can see Baby

Shadows glimpses Amongst the playground of these abandoned
cars Baby leads Buddy in a merry dance

Buddy pulls out his gun Looks around the moving shadows in the
parking lot aims to see if Baby is hiding out -

On a wailing guitar he swings his gun at -

A CHUBBY SECURITY GUARD who is right in the line of fire
drops his coffee and runs right back out of the parking lot

Frustrated Buddy swerves to the second aisle of cars
determined to smoke out Baby Looks low on the ground when -

HEADLIGHTS SWITCH ON A dormant town car ROARS into life and
rams the Charger BOOM Buddy is slammed into a parked car

The town car winds back SLAMS again Baby is at the wheel
Buddy takes the second hit but when he points his gun at the
town car it is already reversing up and just crashes into the
wall Baby is no longer at the wheel Again what the -

Is Buddy going mad Or is Baby magic Here and then gone

As the guitars build up again Buddy turns back into the
original aisle the crashed Mustang now behind him He looks to
one side then the other but not -

AHEAD Drums fill Bass ramps up HEADLIGHTS FLICK ON

A third car a big red angry Yukon faces him and screams
forward Buddy has nowhere to go and no run up He’s trapped

Baby is at the wheel gunning the Yukon flooring it As the
song rushes to a climax -

BOOM Baby smashes into the Charger BOOM The Charger slams
back into the Mustang which breaks through the barrier and
smashes down to P2

Buddy stomps the gas His tires screaming But the Yukon is
winning the game of shove Baby pushing Buddy to the edge

Buddy raises his gun fires Baby ducks A clean bullet hole
where his head once was Both tires SCREAM

Buddy raise to fire again Click He’s out Game over

The Charger tumbles over the broken barrier landing upside
down on top of the fallen Mustang The echo of carnage rings
out with the final chord of the song ‘Brighton Rock ends
Baby reverses quickly to the exit Then stalls Sirens can be
heard distantly But Baby thinks Turns Back down to P2
INT UNDERGROUND PARKING P2 - MOMENTS LATER 98
Baby pulls up to the wreckage of Buddy’s Charger It rests on
top of his crushed Mustang The driver door of the trashed

charger is obscured We hear the engine hiss and die

Baby jumps out of his car and reaches into the Mustang Pulls
out the Queen and the Quincy Jones CD Then hears -

An open door chime

Baby slowly gets up and peers around to the other side of the
wrecked Charger Blood splats on the concrete The door open

Behind him the SNAP of a new clip

Baby turns to see Buddy a hunched up limping bleeding mess
He is clearly dying His head bleeding his torso RED

Buddy approaches Baby gun aloft As the color drains from his
face there’s a hint of the Buddy from earlier A smile

BUDDY
What can I say Baby You did great
You aced it

Baby not sure where this is going is fixed to the spot

BUDDY (CONTD)
But you took away something I loved-

Buddy is at point blank range Gun aimed at Baby’s head

BUDDY (CONTD)
So you know I’ve gotta do the same

BANG Buddy open fires right in Baby’s ear
BANG Buddy fires in the other ear
Buddy falls down DEAD Baby falls down DEAF

HORRIFIC RINGING SOUND Like the tinnitus amplified a million
times into a intense awful WHINE

Baby writhes on the floor He rolls to see Buddy’s lifeless
face Reflected on his dead skin Red and blue lights He can’t
hear the sirens but knows the cops are coming

Baby tries to stand but his balance is off He tumbles his
hand going straight into broken glass He screams but we
cannot hear it over the WHINE Neither can he

Baby struggles to get to his car His equilibrium all off All
the while the red and blues are getting closer

Baby falls into his car Fumbles to start it The car feels
alien Like he cannot operate without sound

Baby struggles for the stereo takes the Queen CD out and puts
it into the CD player Then turns the volume up up up -

The music starts It’s so loud it makes the rear view mirror
shake violently In it we see POLICE CARS turn the corner

Baby puts one bloody hand on the wheel one on the speaker in
his driver door Feels the vibrations of the music and then -

HITS THE GAS Screaming out of P2 and roaring up the ramp The
Black and Whites right behind him

We hear NOTHING of the cars Only the whine in Baby’s ears We
see the rear view and wing mirror pulse with the music The
tempo pulses through Baby’s hand on the speaker

Baby makes it back to Pl but a cruiser BLOCKS the exit The
top level is FULL OF COPS The only way out The way in

Baby swerves towards the ‘SEVERE TIRE DAMAGE’ sign His tires
blow out but he accelerates into the night wheels on fire

The cops are too slow to catch him They struggle to maneuver
as the Pacific Ghost disappears up the street

The WHINE lingers on as a COP CAR pulls back out onto the
downtown streets and we see what he sees -

An empty street An empty car An open door And no Baby

INT CAR - DAY 99

Sunlight Baby is out cold He looks bad Cut bruised His
damaged hand is bandaged with whatever rag was in the car

He wakes and sits up He still cannot hear But he can see
The diner He is parked right outside

What was a friendly place before now feels off He cannot hear
a thing Feel a thing Barry White can’t help him now

He sees DEBORA Strolling into the diner A pretty girl walking
to work just like the first time he saw her

She’s singing along with her iPod again But Baby cannot hear
what she is singing

Baby looks to the cracked Quincy Jones CD cues up a track He
tries to make himself look respectable in the rear view

INT HALF EMPTY DINER - MOMENTS LATER 100
Debora is behind her counter about to start her day The TV
still has non-stop news coverage of the events of the last 24

hours but again the sound is down

The news reports show an artist impression of Baby But no
name He is a mystery man

Debora picks up an LA Times also with the sketch of Baby on the
cover and shakes her head She can’t believe it Then -

BABY walks in Limping Cut Bruised He seems different
Debora freezes Her fellow staff don’t see Baby yet and don’t
connect the man from the TV or paper to the one who just calmly

walked up to the counter Baby tells Debora quietly but firmly

BABY
Let’s go

Debora breathes fast Something in the tone of Baby’s voice has
changed She doesn’t have time to think why

DEBORA
Go

BABY
I want you to come with me Right now

Debora as ever cannot read Baby’s face She glances to see
that one hand is firmly in his jacket pocket Is he armed

DEBORA
Okay Gimme a second

Debora turns away and taking a pen out of her hair quickly
scribbles something on her order pad She leaves it on the
counter as she walks out of the diner

It reads - ‘Help’

INTEXT CARDINER - CONTINUOUS 101

Baby takes Debora to his car A battered white ‘95 Cadillac
Eldorado convertible Opens the door for her like a gentleman

What’s more he opens with his bad hand no longer in his
jacket She notices he isn’t armed but still gets in

Baby sits in the driver’s seat Looks at Debora She looks at
him expectantly He looks at her goofily happy

She looks back into the diner Colleagues have noticed she’s
gone And left with him And still Baby smiles back at her

DEBORA
Are we not in a rush

Baby cocks his head like he doesn’t hear She repeats

DEBORA (CONTD)
Are we in a rush

BABY
We got all the time in the world

Debora doesn’t know how to respond to this Half laughs

BABY (CONTD)
I have this song I wanna play you

Baby presses play Huge rising horns Baby reverses out

INTEXT BABY’S CARLA STREETS 102
‘Lalo Bossa Nova’ by Quincy Jones

A skipping Latin bossa nova beat Cowbell Shakers Tambos The
sun is out Sky is blue Some clouds ahead

Baby plays Quincy Jones at FULL VOLUME He can’t hear it but
Debora can It’s brassy loud defiantly upbeat

She looks at Baby’s face He observes the white lines
stretching ahead and looks calm happy He turns to her asks
expectantly

BABY
Do you like it

Debora almost smiles catches herself What is she doing with
the strange kid who looks fucked up driving off into the
horizon She is still in the waitress outfit It’s crazy

DEBORA
Yes Yes I do

Baby doesn’t seem to think anything of it In fact we as an
audience have never seen him happier He’s beaming

Debora settles a little she doesn’t know where they are going
but it isn’t fast This is a Sunday afternoon drive not a
getaway As the song settles into a slow soft toned guitar
solo she finds herself looking at the scenery

As horns return she sees them first

BLACK and WHITES In her wing mirror The glass reverberates with
the bass of the loud music distorting their image

Baby sees them too In the rear view He simply sighs as they
begin to crest over on a hill And then on a mellow sax -

ROAD BLOCK dead ahead Police as far as the eye can see Debora
gasps It’s a surprise party But not a fun one

Baby slows Behind the police cars block off the street All
pedestrians and other cars have magically vanished

It’s just Baby Debora and the cops

Baby stops As he puts the stick into reverse he looks to
Debora She has her eyes tightly closed Her fingers clutch the
‘oh shit’ handle When she opens her eyes again they are wet
with moisture She’s scared

He doesn’t want her to be scared He turns the engine off But
magically the music continues for our benefit

To Debora’s amazement Baby gets out of the car and walks
toward the cops hands on his head

Quincy Jones has completely taken over and we cannot hear the
harsh shouting of the police as they approach Baby from all
sides guns trained barking instruction

On Debora she’s relieved confused and conflicted

To us the image of the cops approaching feels very surreal as
unlike the opening credits the police are the only ones in

time with the music approaching Baby in step with Quincy

Baby takes off his jacket to show he is unarmed With just a T-
shirt and jeans on he looks like what he is a kid

He turns back to her and mouths -

BABY
Sorry

The police grab him throw him violently to the ground and
swarm around him Debora can see they are beyond angry

As Baby hits the deck all the instruments drop out and on a
four bar drum solo the cops proceed to kick and punch him

Debora jumps out the passenger door and SCREAMS -

DEBORA
No

- Baby being given his new clothes

- Baby walking with a guard down a concrete corridor

- Baby being shown to his 9’ by 5’ prison cell He takes in his
living quarters His ELDERLY CELLMATE is roughly the age of
Joseph His new one room apartment

The song fades out As he sits alone with his thoughts we are
left with Babys buzz of deafness

- Time passes Baby navigates prison life

- Through the buzz we see Baby focus on anything that has
visual rhythm People doing jumping jacks in the yard A warden
shutting cell doors at night People sparring in the gym
Someone mopping the floor

- We see him in the machine shop hypnotized by a metal
stamping contraption Other inmates working here wear eye and
ear protection Baby only has the protective visor on

He stares at the machine nodding as if listening to dance
music Tries to get lost in the rhythm of the machine

INT BABY’S CELL - DAY 103

On Baby sitting alone in his cell staring out to nothing A
guard comes past and hands him an envelope

Inside is a postcard with a 50s style illustration of a young
couple in a classic convertible just like the artwork in the
diner Also inside a beautiful neatly handwritten letter

But first Baby notices The scent

He sniffs inhales the perfume on the letter When he stops he
cocks an ear at the faint sound of burning rubber

INT PRISON UNIT - DAY 104

Baby wanders out of his cell letter still in hand

The noises of roaring engines and screeching tires reverberate
around the prison halls It emanates from the TV room

Baby enters this communal room where inmates gather around a
35 inch TV set showing the noisy Sunday NASCAR races

Baby sees his ELDERLY CELLMATE sitting at the back of the room
He sits down by him Shows him the letter

BABY
What’s this say

The Elderly Cellmate peers through thick glasses at the fancy
handwriting on the letter and blankly intones

ELDERLY CELLMATE
“Hey Baby I’m sorry too I know from
court your real name is Miles but I
don’t know too many Miles songs so we
can stick with Baby Deal

Baby stares at the Elderly Cellmates lips and we magically hear
Debora’s actual voice as he continues

DEBORA (VO)
I found another Debora song It’s by
Dave Edmunds The lyrics say she’s a
‘heart breaking love making
connoisseur’ and frankly she sounds
like a bad person so I am discounting
it Hope this finds you okay Maybe
drive off another time D”

Baby closes his eyes Hears the sweet music of automobiles

EXT PRISON - DAY 105
‘Baby Driver’ by Simon and Garfunkel

Baby walks out of the prison gates into the sunshine Waiting
for him is a smiling DEBORA Looking adorable but-

She is wearing 50s dress bobby socks pleated skirt white
blouse cardigan over the shoulders just like the young woman
in the artwork from the postcard

She stands before a gleaming classic convertible a white 1954
Cadillac Eldorado She opens the passenger door for Baby

Baby walks over to the car He is now also wearing 50s clothes
looking like the young man from the diner artwork

Baby jumps in Debora pops it in drive They kiss and then head
out on the open road
