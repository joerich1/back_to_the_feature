TITLES INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY
ANOTHER TITLE APPEARS BELOW SERIOUSLY

VOICE (0S)
There he is Get him

Open on a MAN running for his life Desperate We are

EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

The man is DAVID SAUNDERS The night is dark and rainy and
soon enough we discover he is indeed being chased - by a pack
of uniformed COPS hot in pursuit

David ducks in to a side yard cuts through an alley and
emerges onto a sidewalk where he plows right into a YOUNG
COUPLE the guy holding an umbrella for the girl He knocks
them over apologizing profusely as he untangles himself

DAVID
I’m so sorry Are you okay

He helps up the stunned Couple who stare at him David’s
fear momentarily turns to extreme sadness looking at the two
of them and how in love they seem

DAVID (contd)
(to the guy)
You take care of her you hear me

The Guy gives a strange look as David runs off into the
night Several cops come racing out of the alley A Police
Car cruises by as well lights flashing

INT RESIDENTIAL HOUSE - KID’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
A FATHER sits on his scared KID’s bed trying to console him

FATHER
No more excuses Andrew There are
no monsters under your bed and no
boogie men in the closet Go to
sleep now ‘Night champ

The Father gets up and leaves the Kid alone nervous in bed

Seconds after the door closes a SHADOW runs up to the large

window of the Kid’s room It is obviously David pausing to

catch his breath but to the Kid it’s Beelzebub himself come
to rip off his head and pull his soul out of his neck

The Kid’s eyes go wide and he SCREAMS bloody murder Davids
shadow JUMPS and runs off just as the Father storms back in
FATHER (cont’d)
Andrew what did I just say

A group of POLICEMEN SHADOWS rush by the window The Father
and son both look freaked out together

EXT STREETS - NIGHT

Breathing heavy David makes a couple more quick detours
trying like hell to lose the cops And as he scales a low
fence runs through a back yard and hurdles a good sized
hedge it looks like he has done just that

The occasional street light shows David seems to have lost
his pursuers Still he doesn’t slow down - until he reaches
a particularly nice APARTMENT BUILDING Then he stops dead
in his tracks and stares up at the building longingly

A light is on in an apartment several stories up He stands
there dazed It looks as though he is lost in another time
Which is unfortunate since the cops remain squarely in the
present In the blink of an eye they’re on David like stink
on a wet dog tackling him out of frame as we stay on the
apartment with the light on high up above

EXT STREET - LATER

A crowd of ON-LOOKERS is illuminated by the flashing lights
of the police cars People whisper to each other gawk and
point at one squad car in particular

INT POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS

Inside that car sits our David He looks destroyed staring
out the window at the crowd a shell of a man We follow his
gaze - an attractive woman stands shivering This is AMANDA
FITZGERALD Her face is beautiful but blank

David keeps focused on her even as the car pulls away He
is the picture of utter devastation

FADE TO BLACK

EXT SAN PEDRO PORT - DAY - 6 YEARS AGO

The sound of a LOUD HORN signals the imminent departure of a
huge CRUISE SHIP docked next to the terminal As the last
few travelers climb aboard a beat-up little Honda Civic cuts
quickly through the parking lot toward the ship

It skids to a halt David and Amanda jump out bags in hand
and sprint toward the ship
DAVID
WAIT

AMANDA
We’re here We’re here

But it’s too late The ship is already moving and the gates
are closed The ATTENDANT behind the gate shakes his head

ATTENDANT
Sorry folks

DAVID
But we’ve got tickets We’re
booked on that ship

AMANDA
We had car trouble Tell them to
open the door and we can jump on

ATTENDANT
Don’t think so

David quickly tries another tactic

DAVID
Come on man Help me out here
It’s our anniversary

ATTENDANT
(nodding)
Mine too Twenty-two years on the
job and I never get tired of
saying it “Sucks to be you”

He walks away WHISTLING proudly at his quick-wittedness
David and Amanda watch their trip sailing away without them

INT AMANDA’S APARTMENT - LATER

Like anyone’s first apartment it’s not a high rent place
but Amanda has made it a home At the moment she sits on
the couch covering her eyes with her hands and laughing

AMANDA
David What are you doing

David enters from the kitchen wearing a life vest anda
sailor’s cap carrying a TV tray with a towel draped over it

DAVID
Not yet keep ‘em closed One more
second and now

He sits on the couch next to her and pulls her hands away
AMANDA
What is this

DAVID
I promised you a cruise didn’t I
Here you better put this on
He pulls out a life vest and hands it to her

AMANDA
David I

DAVID
It’s everything you hoped for ina
romantic Mexican getaway - without
actually getting away
He hits PLAY on a boom box and Los Lobos’ “La Bamba” plays

DAVID (contd)
The authentic sounds of Mexico

He goes over and turns on a FAN sitting on the floor

DAVID (contd)
A tropical ocean breeze

He grabs a squirt bottle and MISTS a few squirts into the
air Amanda smiles shaking her head David reaches over
and plugs in a tanning lamp

DAVID (contd)
Prime tanning conditions should
you want to lay out Topless
sunbathing is encouraged

Running into the kitchen he grabs two tall glasses of some
homemade punch-like alcoholic concoction with fruit and fake
flowers sticking out of it and hands one to her

DAVID (contd)
A complimentary island drink for
those travelers above the legal
drinking age And of course

David whips off the towel from the tray revealing a bowl of
fruit a Domino’s Pizza and a bunch of candy bars

DAVID (cont’d)
« the all-you-can-eat buffet
(beat)
And by “all-you-can-eat” I mean
you can eat all of this But if
you want anything else I’‘1l need
to run to the store
She smiles totally impressed

He clinks

They LAUGH snuggling close in their life vests

DAVID (contd)
I’m sorry we didn’t make that boat
Amanda But on the bright side if
you get thirsty here in your
apartment you can drink the water

AMANDA
Do you know how totally in love I
am with you David Saunders

her glass

DAVID
I hope so These life jackets
don’t come cheap

They KISS

It’s a highly romantic moment - until Amanda SHRIEKS

AMANDA

AHHH A rat

David jumps up onto the couch more alarmed than Amanda

DAVID
What Where

AMANDA
There

She points as a very large RAT lumbers across the floor

DAVID
Okay Okay I’1l1 get him Uh
you distract him and I’1l go find

something heavy Or sharp
AMANDA

No wait David don’t kill it
DAVID

Why not They have diseases and

stuff don’t they

AMANDA
Well yeah but he’s kinda cute
isn’t he

David pauses in mid-shiver and looks
a rat - fat and furry
fell on the floor and falls asleep

DAVID

It is pretty cute for

The rat snuggles up in a napkin that

David is won over

Now that was just plain adorable
They smile holding each other as they look down at their rat
like proud parents The front door opens and a thin nervous
Indian man enters This is PUMPANG He instantly SCREAMS

PUMPANG
AHHHHHHH

David and Amanda are obviously startled as well

DAVID AND AMANDA

AHHHHHHH

The Rat doesn’t appreciate being woken up so he waddles off
over Pumpang’s feet and out the door Pumpang continues
SCREAMING and SLAMS THE DOOR after it Amanda rushes over

AMANDA
Pumpang Pumpang it’s okay
You’re fine Everything’s alright

Amanda comforts Pumpang as he tries to breathe

PUMPANG
I have house sat for you before
but each time I did the apartment
was empty I am very confused

AMANDA
I’m sorry We should have called

David hands him an island drink

DAVID
Vacation’s off Missed the boat
Didn’t mean to scare you buddy

PUMPANG
(still rattled)
There was an animal

DAVID
It was just a rat Pumpang

Pumpang is in his own world

PUMPANG
They are a scourge in India
Millions of them Feeding
defecating dying Horrible
(shaking his head)
Their taste haunts me to this day

DAVID
(beat)
I better go order some more pizza
Pumpang shakes it off looking at his two dear friends
PUMPANG
Wait But this is your one year
dating anniversary You must do
something - it is a very important
and romantic occasion
Pumpang digs out a camera from his knapsack

PUMPANG (cont’d)
I will take your picture

David and Amanda look at each other and smile

DAVID
I love you Amanda

AMANDA
I love you too

Pumpang look at them from behind his camera

PUMPANG
Okay and watch the birdies

Pumpang SNAPS the PICTURE

CLOSE ON THE RESULT - a snapshot of David and Amanda smiling
in love looking like the happiest couple on earth

Pull back to show LACE and HEART STICKERS border the photo

AMANDA (0S)
It’s beautiful

Reveal that we are in

INT DAVID AND AMANDAS LARGE APARTMENT - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY

The place looks like a spread out of an interior decorating
magazine - beautiful furniture and accessories gorgeous rugs
cover the floors and beautiful artwork covers the walls A
far cry from the last apartment we saw them in

Amanda sits on a couch holding a large elaborately
designed meticulously kept SCRAPBOOK looking at the last
photo - the one with David and Amanda in life jackets

Pumpang sits next to her On the couch opposite them are
Amanda’s sister CINDY PARKS and her husband JIM Amanda
closes the scrapbook and shakes her head overwhelmed The
cover is meticulously arranged fabric and beads sewn in a
cursive scrawl - “David and Amanda - The First Seven Years”
AMANDA
I don’t know what to say Pumpang
I love it Thank you

Cindy takes the scrapbook and flips through it unimpressed

CINDY
Huh Cute Why are you wearing
life vests in this one

AMANDA
Well we were supposed to go ona
cruise but-—-

CINDY
Oh my God Jim’s never been but
you remember Peter my ex The
entertainment lawyer We took a
ten day cruise The Bahamas
Bermuda Aruba - we hit them all
Un-be-liev-able The most amazing
food foofy drinks and we had a
cabin with its own balcony You
could have sex right there with a
view of the entire Caribbean at the
foot of your bed you know The
most romantic ten days of my life

Jim nods Probably not the first time he’s heard that one

JIM
Well have to do that sometime

A beat of awkward silence before Jim changes the subject

JIM (contd)
So you took all these pictures
Pumpang You’re a good friend

PUMPANG
Yes well I had to For class

AMANDA
That’s how I met Pumpang Intro to
Photography That was back when
you were a journalism major right

PUMPANG
Yes I had no friends No life
No one cared for Pumpang I did
not even know how to use the camera
until Amanda came

Cindy shakes her head and turns to Amanda
CINDY
You always were a sucker for
sympathy cases

Pumpang swallows the lump in his throat

PUMPANG
Without Amanda and David I would
not have survived College is a
cutthroat world you know But one
day I will hold that document in my
hand that says I have done it I
have defied the odds I Pumpang
have earned a Masters degree

JIM
That’s great What’s your focus

PUMPANG
Human psychology The scrapbooking
I do just for fun

Cindy could care less

CINDY
Yeah well I hate to be the party
pooper here but if this is
supposed to be your “anniversary”
or whatever where’s David

AMANDA
Well I’m sure he’1ll be home soon
Work’s been really busy He’s got
this big project designing a new
hospital wing

Cindy frowns shaking her head - she’s heard that one before

CINDY
You sound just like Mom She was
always making excuses for Dad too
Jim’s an executive VP at the
second largest bank in the state
but you don’t see me having to
apologize for him

JIM
It’s actually the third largest--

CINDY
I mean Jim’s no Saudi prince - you
remember that old boyfriend from
art school Mahmoud Wasn’t he
the sweetest - but still

off Jim’s stoic look

INT DAVID AND AMANDA’S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

David gets off the elevator and walks toward his apartment a
harried professional in his suit and tie on his cell phone

DAVID
Yes sir I understand what’s at
stake I am beyond committed You
have my word youll get the designs
as soon as humanly possible Yes
sir I promise Thank you sir

He hangs up exhausted from the call frazzled from the day
He opens the door

INT DAVID AND AMANDA’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

-and looks at the group gathered in his living room Not
exactly what he was hoping for Cindy is still rambling

CINDY
-He was very handsome for a
Persian And who knew Muslims were
such generous lovers--

She notices David and immediately stops talking He tries
valiantly to muster up a smile

DAVID
Hey The gang’s all here huh
Hey Jim How are you
(beat not real friendly)
Cindy

She says nothing in response

DAVID (contd)
Well I’ve got work to do so I’11
just be in the back

AMANDA
David What about dinner

DAVID
No thanks I grabbed a burger on
my way home Good seeing you guys

He leaves kissing her chastely on the cheek and heads to
the bedroom Amanda doesn’t look happy Neither does Cindy

CINDY
Well we should go
(re David)
You’ve got a new asshole to tear

JIM
Thanks again Amanda Everything
was delicious See you Pumpang

Pumpang waves goodbye but Cindy yanks Jim out the door before
he can return the wave Amanda quietly closes the door

INT APARTMENT BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

David is typing on his laptop Amanda stands in the doorway
staring at him He stops typing and looks up at her

DAVID
Hey honey

He is already typing again

DAVID (cont’d)
Listen I’ve got a lot of work to
do You mind shutting that door
Thanks sweetheart

She stares at him for a long beat

AMANDA
I made tacos

DAVID
Really That’s great

AMANDA
Fish tacos With shredded cabbage
and pineapple salsa

DAVID
That sounds good honey Maybe
I’1l have some for lunch tomorrow
Right now I really need to focus

AMANDA
It was our anniversary tonight

DAVID
Honey please I --

David freezes Oh shit Time to cover
DAVID (cont’d)
I know I wanted to surprise you
So Happy Anniversary

He gets up and goes to hug her She doesn’t let him

AMANDA
You forgot

DAVID
No I didn’t How can you say that
Look I got you a present

His eyes scour the room After a beat he reaches into his

pocket and pulls out a PEN He offers it to her
AMANDA
A pen
DAVID

It’s got a comfort grip and gel
ink It never smears I think
it’s the kind astronauts use

She shakes her head and leaves not taking the pen

INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
She is already cleaning up from dinner when David catches up

DAVID
Alright I’m sorry It slipped my
mind I’11 get you another
present but I’m telling you I
really think you’1l like that pen

AMANDA
Do you even know why I made all
this for dinner

DAVID
Because we’re out of chicken

AMANDA
Our first date we went to El
Compadre Free guacamole
Wednesdays We both got

DAVID
(remembering)
Fish tacos Of course I remember
that And nachos to start

Amanda shakes her head

AMANDA
Quesadillas And for dessert

DAVID
(trying to recall)
-dessert tacos

AMANDA
Nice try Flan

She scrapes a pan of glistening flan into the sink and flips
the DISPOSAL loudly grinding it up in the gurgling water

DAVID
Amanda Amanda

He switches the disposal off

DAVID (cont’d)
Okay you got me I don’t remember
everything we ordered But I do
remember what an amazing night that
was And every night since then
(beat)
Are we cool now

AMANDA
“Are we cool” Have you been
listening to anything I’ve said

DAVID
Of course I have You’re upset
about our anniversary

AMANDA
I could give a shit about our
anniversary at this point David
It’s us That’s what I’m upset
about What are we doing

David rubs his temples He’s been through this before

DAVID
Honestly I have no idea Look I
really need to get back to work
Why don’t we talk about this in the
morning Actually I have to be in
early How about lunch Or
dinner Dinner Probably Okay

AMANDA
I can’t do this David

At this very emotional moment Pumpang enters
PUMPANG
Hey could one of you give me a
ride back to my dorm when you get a
chance I didn’t bring my scooter
A long silent beat The three stand there in the kitchen

PUMPANG (cont’d)
Youre fighting aren’t you
DAVID
We’re not fighting

AMANDA
Yes we are

Pumpang quietly heads back out like a beaten child

PUMPANG
I’1l wait

Pumpang gone David gets back to the subject at hand

DAVID
This is about marriage isn’t it

AMANDA

Please I wasn’t expecting you to
waltz in here tonight in a tuxedo
and hand me a diamond ring - but I
was hoping you’d at least show up
Do you have any idea how hard it is
constantly being a distant second
to your boyfriend’s job

David sighs deeply

DAVID
How many times have we been over
this I’m under a ton of pressure
at work I’m heading up a high
profile project that requires all
my attention and will hopefully
advance my career - if I don’t
screw it up And if I do screw it
up I could very easily be fired
So as much as I’d love to sit
around shooting the shit with your
charming sister I just can’t

Now it’s Amanda’s turn to sigh

AMANDA
This is stupid We’ve got to stop
kidding ourselves We obviously
want different things You want to
be the world’s most successful
architect I want a committed
relationship with someone who loves
me more than his job

A sad beat David doesn’t know what to say
AMANDA (cont’d)

You and I need to face the fact
that we just don’t belong together

DAVID
Amanda

She looks resolute David looks tired He gives up

DAVID (cont’d)
Maybe you’re right Look I’m
sorry Right now I’m too tired to
fight about this I do love you
but I’ve got a lot of work to do

She turns and exits into the bathroom slamming the door
David shakes his head and heads back into the bedroom
Pumpang looking nervous returns

PUMPANG
Are we better now Guys

INT PRISM ARCHITECTURE OFFICES - MORNING

Establish a sprawling modern architecture design firm Well-
dressed WORKERS are just starting to filter in

INT DAVID’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

David sits at his desk working on a 3-D modeling program A

MAN walks by his door then a beat later returns This is

RICH BOSWELL a guy you’d avoid like a cold sore if he wasn’t
THE BOSS

RICH
Saunders Working hard or hardly
working

Before David can respond Rich is answering his own question

RICH (contd)
Don’t tell me - working hard at
hardly working Am I right

DAVID
I’m keeping busy sir

RICH
You bet You don’t mind if I take
a load off do you

Rich settles himself on David’s couch not needing a reply

RICH (contd)
Saunders I’ve always prided myself
on being the first one into the
office every morning Done it
since I started this company
(MORE)

RICH (contd)
But today I come in and there’s
already a light on when I get here
What’s up

DAVID
Nothing just thought I’d get an
early start on some of this

Rich gives him a suspicious look

RICH

4 AM Saunders You either
suddenly grew a borderline Japanese
work ethic or you got caught in
the zipper Which is it

(bad Japanese accent)
“Ah so” or

(bad Mexican accent
Problema de la chica chica

DAVID
Well I did have a fight with my
girlfriend

RICH

Girlfriends are nothing but
trouble Stick with hookers
that’s what I always say

DAVID
(momentarily thrown)
Well um I’ve got the designs
ready if you’d like to see them

David hands Rich a set of plans

RICH
Wow Very impressive Saunders
Looks like you’re in the running
for Employee of the Month I’1l
take a look and get back to you

Rich exits and David sighs relieved Then Rich returns

RICH (contd)
You know I was joking about the
Employee of the Month This isn’t
Wal-Mart We don’t do awards

DAVID
I understand sir

Rich exits again David’s assistant KAREN enters She is
cute in a plain way sweet protective and very loyal
KAREN
Okay when were you going to tell
me what’s going on with Amanda

David is caught off guard

DAVID
Karen How did you--

KAREN
I was listening That’s what good
assistants do now spill it

DAVID
(deep breath)
Well there’s not much to tell We
just had a fight last night and
some things were said that’s all

KAREN
Oh my God You two never fight
Was it serious
(beat - deadly serious)
You didn’t break up did you

DAVID
Well it was kind of vague but I
think that was the general idea

Karen has to sit down

KAREN
But you’ve been together
forever I mean I can’t believe
it And you’re taking it so well

DAVID
Well Amanda’s an emotional girl
There’s a good chance when I get
home she’1ll have forgotten the
whole thing anyway

INT DAVID AND AMANDA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The apartment is pitch dark as David enters

DAVID
Hello

He sets down his briefcase and flips on the light
David looks around - the place is damn near empty

Everything that made the apartment a home - all the
paintings the furniture - everything is gone

Somewhere David hears a quiet feminine WEEPING

DAVID (cont’d)
Amanda

He moves through the apartment - have they been robbed He
ducks in each room searching for the CRYING

INT BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Finally he gets to the bedroom and flips on the light

DAVID
Amanda what hap--

It isn’t Amanda crying it’s Pumpang huddled in a fetal
position against the headboard of the completely stripped
bed He tries to speak through a flood of tears

PUMPANG
What have you done

DAVID
How long have you been sitting in
the dark Pumpang

Pumpang SOBS he has no idea

PUMPANG
We were like a family David When
I met you two I had no one I was
an outcast even from my own
parents in India

DAVID
They send you a check every month

PUMPANG
Not out of love Out of guilt
And now it is like my family has
been ripped apart once again I am
alone

DAVID
Youre not alone Pumpang We’re
still friends Hey maybe now we
can spend more “guy” time together
You know It could be fun

Pumpang looks offended

PUMPANG
FUN This is a tragedy David I
suppose after the Dahab earthquake
of 1995 you could ignore the death
and destruction and suffering and
go spend the day riding the tea
cups at Disney World I’m sorry
but I cannot My world is over

Pumpang bursts into tears David puts his arm around him

DAVID
It might not seem like it now but
it’s gonna be alright Sometimes
people just grow apart They want
different things We’re gonna be
just fine Pumpang I promise

Pumpang continues his weeping as he shudders in David’s arms
DISSOLVE TO
A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE POPPING

TITLES SIX MONTHS LATER

INT PRISM ARCHITECTURE OFFICES - EVENING

APPLAUSE as Rich hands out cups of SPARKLING CIDER Copies
of Davids designs sit by a scale model and aerial photos of
a futuristic looking glass shell hospital wing

RICH
To David Saunders and the grand
opening of the Claude Stuart
Memorial Thoracic Wing Here’s to
sick people and lots of ‘em

Rich pounds his drink despite the mildly uncomfortable toast
The other CO-WORKERS drink David smiles at the small group

DAVID
Thanks a lot everybody

Everyone starts heading back to their offices as Rich
intercepts Dave pouring more champagne into his glass

RICH
Good work Saunders A man should
be so lucky to have a heart attack
in your building

DAVID
Thank you sir I’m just glad all
those hours and all that effort
paid off You sacrifice a lot when
you’re on a project like that -
friends family any life outside
the office but in the end you--

Rich interrupts

RICH
Yeah well friends and family
don’t pay you lots of money though
do they
(moving on)
Right So Saunders tell me you
like opera

David is not sure where he’s going with this one

DAVID
I don’t really listen to--

RICH
I hate it Personally if I wanted
to hear fat people singing in
foreign languages Id follow my
housekeeper around all day She’s
from Nicaragua Muy grande

Another confusing awkward silence Rich doesn’t notice

RICH (contd)
The point is the Long Beach Opera
wants a new concert hall And they
want you to design it Apparently
they were impressed with your work
on that hospital

DAVID
Wow That’s amazing

RICH
Damn right it is This is the big
time Saunders You are as they
say the “shit”

David is thrilled Rich looks at his drink

RICH (contd)
God I hate cider
(beat to David)
My sponsor’s out of the country
What do you say we go get a real
drink or ten Feel like a little
quality time with the ol’ boss-man

Not much of a choice Off David’s pained expression

INT THE DIAMOND BAR - LATER

The club is packed the music pounding the lights throbbing
It’s the kind of place that gives epileptics seizures and
everyone else a headache Doesn’t seem to bother Rich

RICH
(yelling over the music)
I tried waxing once - a back sack
and crack they call it - but when
they start growing back - talk
about itchy

David is obviously disturbed After a beat he yells too

DAVID
I’m um going to step outside for
a minute Get some fresh air My
head is kind of pounding you know

Rich nods and yells

RICH
Another drink Gin and tonic

DAVID
Right Great Thanks

David quickly squeezes his way through the crowds of people
trying to get away from the bar It’s a struggle

EXT DIAMOND BAR - NIGHT

He finally makes it outside squeezing out the back door to a
much quieter courtyard area He takes a breath but quickly
COUGHS The place is filled with smoke And smokers

CINDY (0S)
And Bermuda is to die for I was
there once with this Brazilian
soccer coach before Jim and I were
married of course and it was just
heaven on earth Wed sit in these
hammocks and drink pina coladas

The familiar voice draws David’s attention to a GROUP OF
SMOKERS at the edge of the courtyard It’s Cindy And
wouldn’t you know it she looks over at just the same time

CINDY (contd)
(fake smile)
David What a surprise

David is clearly not excited to see her but his only option
is returning to Rich so he holds his ground

DAVID
Hello Cindy

CINDY
Look at you Jim look who’s here

Jim looks relieved to have someone else to talk to

JIM
Hey David How’s it going

DAVID
Fine Good

CINDY
I didn’t know you went to clubs
You don’t seem the social type

DAVID
(trying to stay polite)
Well I try to get out when I can

CINDY
Too bad You know you just missed
Amanda She literally just left

David is thrown by the mention of her name

DAVID
Oh Really I didn’t realize she
was into clubs either

CINDY
She is now You probably wouldnt
even recognize her She looks
amazing working out all the time
I would kill for her figure I
swear she’s gone up a cup size

She is really laying it on monitoring his face for pain
grief heartbreak something But David is not biting

DAVID
Well it’d be good to catch up with
her sometime Tell her I said hi

This guy is tough Cindy goes in for the kill

CINDY
I don’t think that’s a good idea
David See she’s dating someone
A month now And she’s so happy
Finally - a crack in David’s armor He tries to cover

DAVID
Really Oh Well that’s great
Whoever he is he’s a lucky guy

CINDY
(all smiles)
So What about you Are you
seeing anyone special Or are you
here alone

DAVID
(slightly defensive)
What No I’m not here alone

He looks back inside and decides to stretch the truth

DAVID (contd)
I’m actually here with a girl

CINDY
Really

DAVID
Yeah Just out you know getting
a drink Hanging out having fun

CINDY
(not buying it)
How sweet

DAVID
Yeah so I better get back inside
Don’t want her to think I’m
ignoring her Well it was good
to see you

Just then the back door opens and Rich comes out wielding
two fresh drinks

RICH
Hey Dave There you are I was
starting to wonder what happened to
you One g and t coming up

David is busted Cindy loves it

She takes Jim’s hand and leads her group of FRIENDS back
As she passes David she whispers to him

inside

CINDY
Well you two have a nice evening

CINDY (cont’d)
You make a lovely couple

She LAUGHS as they leave David hangs his head embarrassed

RICH
So wanna hit another club or just
pick up some skanks here and head
back to my place I got a hot tub

David could not be any more miserable

INT DAVID’S APARTMENT - LATER

David opens the door enters and turns the light on The
place is almost as empty as the day Amanda left The only
furniture in the living room is a large beanbag and a tiny
folding card table There is one old sad TV - not even
hooked up to cable David heads to the bedroom

INT DAVID’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - LATER

Now dressed more casually David enters and opens the fridge
But other than a few cans of beer a Chinese takeout box and
a jar of mustard it’s empty Wow that’s depressing

He opens the takeout box and is nearly knocked over by the
stench Still he hasn’t eaten

INT DAVID’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

David sits on the couch with the Chinese the mustard and the
beer He turns on the TV dipping the rancid Chinese into
the jar of mustard He grimaces with each bite

The NEWS is on A REPORTER stands in front of an apartment

REPORTER
Authorities say Trevor Oates’
bloated corpse was discovered by
neighbors who complained of a foul
stench coming from the apartment

A clip of a NEIGHBOR is cut in to the story

NEIGHBOR
Yeah I mean the guy was by
himself a lot He’d go to work
but other than that he didn’t do
much Just kept to himself
Didn’t have friends or family that
I know of Just sat on his couch
watching TV you know

David looks at himself alone on the couch like that poor
dead recluse

NEIGHBOR (contd)
It smelled real bad so I went in
and found the dude dead just
sitting there on his couch Alone
Kinda sad really

He turns the TV off throws out the Chinese puts the mustard
back in the fridge and goes to the closet

Hangers hang mostly empty Most things are stacked on
shelves David reaches up for a jacket which is wedged
under some other items He yanks it down upsetting the
stack sending the items tumbling down on him

Nothing heavy mind you But it is odd what actually lands
on him an old LIFE VEST David looks at it for a long beat

INT PUMPANG’S DORM - LATE NIGHT
David knocks on the door Inside are sounds of a video game

VOICE (OS
Panger Get the door dude

PUMPANG (0S)
Just one moment please I am
right in the middle of--

ANOTHER VOICE (0S)
Now Panger Come on We’re
kicking some serious ass man

Pumpang opens the door He’s excited to see David

PUMPANG
David What are you doing here
It is the middle of the night

DAVID
I know I’m sorry I just needed
to talk to someone

PUMPANG
Of course That is what friends
are for Come in come in

David enters finding a familiar college sight - a cramped
cluttered guys’ dorm room The common area has posters on
the walls (Zeppelin a bikini-clad girl on a Corvette) a TV
and a brown mini-fridge Two COLLEGE DUDES sit on a folded
up futon playing a heated game of HALO on the big screen TV

PUMPANG (cont’d)
You know Jeff and Stu

JEFF STU
‘Sup bra Hey

They don’t lose a beat as they work their controllers

PUMPANG (cont’d)
We can talk in my room

He and David walk into one of the tiny adjoining bedrooms

INT PUMPANG’S DORM - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Pumpang’s room is different from the common area it’s very
tidy and sparkling clean Soft Indian music plays incense
burns in the window and neat little stacks of SCRAPBOOKING
papers stickers and felt are organized across his tiny desk

PUMPANG
How is it going my friend I have
been meaning to call you but Jeff
and Stu have been using the phone
to play online video games all day

DAVID
You really should move Pumpang
Isn’t there any graduate student
housing or something you can go to

PUMPANG
I don’t mind Really Besides it
is much more affordable this way

Out in the other room Jeff and Stu shout at the video game

PUMPANG (contd)
I want to show you something

Pumpang pulls out a two foot thick SCRAPBOOK from under his
bed and drops it in David’s lap

PUMPANG (cont’d)
It’s my college memories - volume
one The undergraduate years

DAVID
That’s a lot of memories

David heaves it aside Pumpang sits looking concerned
PUMPANG

But you did not come to talk
scrapbooking did you David
DAVID
Listen Pumpang I’ve got some bad
news and I thought I should tell
you sooner than later

PUMPANG
(instantly panicked)
My family is dead aren’t they
Shot to death Beaten They did
not get on a train did they

DAVID
No Pumpang your family is fine
As far as I know It’s Amanda
(trying to find the words)
She’s dating someone

Pumpang sits there for a second unmoving relieved

PUMPANG
Oh Yes I know
(beat)
So no one has been killed

David glares at Pumpang

DAVID
What do you mean you know

PUMPANG
Well she has been seeing Sebastian
for a while now

DAVID
Sebastian You know his name

PUMPANG
Yes She says he is very nice

David is shocked to hear this coming from Pumpang

DAVID
I can’t believe you knew about this
already Why didn’t you tell me

PUMPANG
I thought it might upset you

DAVID
Me Why would it upset me You
were the one who cried for three
weeks straight when we broke up

PUMPANG
(shrugs)
It took some time I am fine now

David tries to deal with his emotions as Pumpang hunts
through his desk He hands David a MEN’S HEALTH magazine

PUMPANG (cont’d)
Page 99

DAVID
What is this

PUMPANG
You want to see him Page 99
Silver timepiece

David flips to page 99 A full page black and white glossy
of a shirtless slightly older sweat beaded ADONIS with a
hard hat on set against a setting sun On his wrist is a
beautiful silver watch It’s an ad for BULOVA WATCHES

DAVID
I don’t get it He owns a watch
company

PUMPANG

The man in the watch That’s him
Dave looks closer at the chiseled silhouette

DAVID
She’s dating a construction worker

PUMPANG
He’s not a construction worker
He’s a model posing as a
construction worker

Dave stares at the ad in disbelief

DAVID
She gave you this

Pumpang nods

DAVID (contd)
I never thought she was that
shallow To date someone just for
his looks

PUMPANG
Oh no he’s very intelligent

DAVID
How smart do you have to be to be a
model

PUMPANG
Well he’s a cardiologist

DAVID
You said he was a male model

PUMPANG
Yes Mostly just for fun I think
On his days off But normally

he’s a cardiologist

David looks like he’s had the wind knocked out of him a bit

DAVID
He’s a male model and a doctor

PUMPANG
Heart surgeon

Pumpang takes the magazine back and looks at the picture

PUMPANG (cont’d)
She says he is also an excellent
cook I’m having dinner with them
tomorrow night I am excited to

meet him
David looks at him in complete disbelief

DAVID
You’re having dinner

PUMPANG

Yes I think he’s making lasagna

A small dagger in David’s heart

DAVID
That was our dinner

Lasagna
We ate it all the time

Pumpang

PUMPANG
It’s a common dish I don’t think

he is making it out of spite
Pumpang looks at David noticing a far away look in his eyes

DAVID
It’s crazy I mean I figured
shed be dating I certainly
wouldn’t expect her to wait around
for me you know I dated a little
bit too - when I wasn’t working 18-

hour days but nothing like this
Pumpang nods respectful

David waves the magazine absently

PUMPANG
He does seem rather special
doesn’t he

DAVID
(ignoring the comment)
It’s been so long since Ive really
thought about anything other than
work But then tonight I started
thinking about Amanda and I

realize I kinda miss her
PUMPANG

When was the last time you talked
DAVID

I don’t know A long time Too

long

(beat)
You’re right I should go talk to
her Catch up See what’s going
on Yeah Thanks Pumpang This
was good I’1l see you later

David gets up but Pumpang stops him before he leaves

PUMPANG
You might want to wait for
tomorrow It is very late David

DAVID
Right Tomorrow Good idea

INT DEARHEART SCHOOL FOR DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN - MORNING

A room full of DISADVANTAGED (meaning POORTROUBLED

ABANDONED

not retarded) KIDS work on art projects at desks

We end on a CHUBBY KID smearing peanut butter on a pinecone

AMANDA
Donnie What have you got there

Amanda puts a hand on his shoulder smiling patiently She
does look EVEN BETTER than the last time we saw her Her
figure even under the teacher’s attire is fantastic And
more than just the physical she has a glow about her

DONNIE
It’s a pinecone with peanut butter
on it

She smiles at him prompting him along

AMANDA
That’s right And if we sprinkle
some seeds on it like this

She helps him cover the pinecone with bird seed

AMANDA (contd)
then we can hang it up outside
and you’ve got a perfect homemade
bird feeder

Donnie inspects his work

DONNIE
Can I have some peanut butter too
Miss Fitzgerald

AMANDA
Let’s wait until lunchtime Donnie
(to class)
Okay everybody Five more minutes
and then we need to clean up--
(beat distracted)
David

AMANDA’S POV - David stands at the doorway visible
through the small window He smiles and waves casually

INT DEARHEART SCHOOL - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
Amanda steps out to find David leaning against the lockers

DAVID
Sorry hope I didn’t interrupt

AMANDA
You did You shouldn’t be here

DAVID
Well I was in the neighborhood and
I figured we haven’t talked in a
while so I thought I’d just stop by
and see how you were

An awkward moment as David smiles at her hoping to talk

AMANDA
I’m working

DAVID
Yeah I saw You’re amazing
Those are some lucky kids in there

AMANDA

Theyre orphans and runaways

David

How are they lucky

David doesn’t quite have an answer for that

Listen

AMANDA (contd)
I’m not sure what this is

all about but now is not the time

She starts to go back into class David tries to stop her

DAVID

Wanna grab dinner sometime

Amanda stops She turns to him

DAVID (contd)

Something casual Pizza or
Mexican maybe if you want We
could split a fish taco or two

David

I know
But we’

AMANDA
I’m seeing someone else

DAVID
And I’m happy for you
ve known each other for

geez a long time We’ve been
through a lot Boyfriend or not I
don’t think that’s something we

should

just throw away

AMANDA

We didn’t throw it away David
You did

She turns back to

Please

him as she opens the door

AMANDA (contd)
don’t come back here Only

students and faculty are allowed on

school

grounds

She is about to go into her class and shut the door

Wait
Amanda

DAVID
Don’t shut that door
If you shut that door on

me then I’1ll just have to walk
right out of here Out of your

life

And any chance of

She SHUTS the door and turns to her class Dave stands there

for a moment not

walking anywhere He laughs uncomfortably

DAVID (cont’d)
Okay I admit that was a bit
dramatic and I’m sorry It’s fine
that you closed the door It
doesn’t have to be a metaphor for
our relationship I just think you
should give it some more thought

She returns to the door - has he changed her mind and her
heart Apparently not - she pulls down the blind completely
shutting him off Slightly stunned David walks away

EXT PRISM ARCHITECTURE - DAVID’S OFFICE WINDOW - NIGHT

David sits at his desk working one of the only people left
in the office He stares out the window at the city lights
below and sighs He frankly looks a little bit lost

INT AMANDA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Pumpang stands at the door looking nervous It opens and
SEBASTIAN sticks out his hand He is just as gorgeous with
his shirt on and without the hard hat And friendly too

SEBASTIAN
There he is Sebastian Cole
Great to finally meet you Pumpang
(beat concerned)
Am I pronouncing that correctly

PUMPANG
(smiling)
Yes you are Thank you

Amanda calls from over at the table She is pouring wine

AMANDA
Come on in Dinner’s about ready

Pumpang does as he’s told dragging his scooter in with him
It’s one hell of a nice place - she moved up in the world
when she moved out of David’s life

PUMPANG
It is so nice here so clean And
there is no noise And no people
smoking pot on the couch

Pumpang catches his scooter on a box near the door knocking
it over and spilling a dozen or so children’s paintings and
sculptures and peanut butter covered pine cones on the floor

AMANDA
Sorry I meant to put that away
I’m organizing a field trip to the
art museum for the kids so I had
them doing art projects today

Amanda tries to scoop them up Sebastian beats her to it

SEBASTIAN
Let me get that honey

He scoops everything up and smiles at her

SEBASTIAN (contd)
Pumpang back me up on this is she
not the most extraordinary woman
youve ever met So compassionate
and caring - and so incredibly
beautiful We are two lucky
fellas

He gives her a kiss and she melts

AMANDA
Youve got to stop doing that I
might start believing you
(beat)
I’1l go check on your lasagna Why
don’t you boys get acquainted

She heads to the kitchen they sit down on her stylish couch

SEBASTIAN
So what part of India are you from

Pumpang is instantly suspicious

PUMPANG
Why

SEBASTIAN
I was just curious I’ve spent
some time over there

PUMPANG
(reluctantly)
I am from Dum Dum

He waits for the laughter There is none Sebastian smiles

SEBASTIAN
Outside Calcutta I had the most
delicious pakoras from a street
vendor in Dum Dum Served them
hot right out of the frying pot
Fantastic

Pumpang is visibly amazed

PUMPANG
You had pakoras in Dum Dum

SEBASTIAN

I spent a few years as a Peace
Corps volunteer in Bangladesh

(subtitled in English)
Between semesters at medical
school I worked in Chittagong at a
youth development center training
teenage girls in esteem and
empowerment workshops

Pumpang’s eyes grow to the size of throw pillows

PUMPANG

(subtitled in English)
You speak Bengali And you don’t
even have an accent

SEBASTIAN

At the time I was fluent Anymore
the only time I use Bengali is when
I read the poetry of Rabindranath
Tagore

(from memory in Bengali

subtitled in English)
“I leave no trace of wings in the
air But I am glad I have had my
flight”

Pumpang’s jaw has involuntarily dropped

PUMPANG
Wow
The DOORBELL RINGS
SEBASTIAN
Ill get it

Jim and Cindy come in Greetings are exchanged with hands
shook and Cindy hugging Sebastian She sniffs his neck

CINDY
Oh Sebastian You smell amazing
Jim you have to get this cologne
What is it

SEBASTIAN
I’m not actually wearing anything

CINDY
(coquettishly laughing)
Don’t tease
She touches his exposed forearm and her eyes light up
CINDY (contd)
I swear you have the softest skin
Jim feel his skin
She grabs his hand and makes him feel Sebastian’s arm

JIM
Very nice Hey Pumpang

Amanda comes in from the kitchen and Cindy hugs her

CINDY
Oh sis This one’s a keeper

Everyone laughs Amanda takes Sebastian’s arm and smiles

EXT COLLEGE DORM - BIKE RACK - LATER
Pumpang carefully chains his scooter to a bike rack

DAVID (0S)
Hey Pumpang

Pumpang jumps pulling a small mace can from its holster on
his belt Without aiming sprays a bush behind him

PUMPANG
Stay away Don’t hurt me

DAVID
Pumpang It’s just me buddy
Settle down

Pumpang sees David sitting on the marble base of a statue

PUMPANG
David I’m sorry There have been
many rapes on college campuses
across the country We must always
be prepared to take back the night

DAVID
Sure I understand Didn’t mean
to waste all your pepper spray

PUMPANG
It’s okay I have more

He lifts up a pant leg and shows an ankle holster
PUMPANG (cont’d)
What are you doing here

DAVID
I was on my way home from work
driving around You know
(beat)
How was dinner

PUMPANG
Dinner Well it was good We had
warm spinach salad with a bacon
vinaigrette the lasagna you know
For dessert we had creme brulee--

David holds up his hand cutting him off

DAVID
I appreciate the attention to
detail Pumpang but I guess I was
more interested in the new guy

PUMPANG
You mean Sebastian I liked him

It takes David a moment to process this information

DAVID
What did you just say

PUMPANG
He’s very polite Intelligent
Friendly Smooth skin

DAVID
Oh really That’s great He
sounds wonderful Perfect really

They stand there a beat Awkward

PUMPANG
Do you want to come in for a while
I believe Jim and Stu went to a
laser show at the planetarium

DAVID
No thanks I better go I don’t
have time for this I’ve got a lot
of work to do
(beat)
I’m building an opera house

Pumpang doesn’t quite know what that means

PUMPANG
Okay

Pumpang stands there empty mace can in hand and watches
David walk off into the night

INT PRISM ARCHITECTURE OFFICES - MORNING

David sits at his desk resting his head in his hands

KAREN
Regular headache or hangover

Startled David looks up noticing Karen in the doorway He
quickly slips something into his desk drawer

DAVID
No I was just thinking

Karen looks him in the eye and shakes her head

KAREN
Oh God I knew it

DAVID
What

KAREN

It’s been almost 6 months

Karen marches over and opens up the drawer Inside is a
PHOTO of David and Amanda on a fishing trip

KAREN (cont’d)
You’re not over her are you

David does not choose to answer

KAREN (cont’d)
I may not be in a serious
relationship right now but if
there’s one thing I know better
than office politics - it’s matters
of the heart

DAVID
I’m fine Karen I don’t need any--

KAREN

(cuts him off)
Yes you do Listen to me David
I’ve seen every romantic comedy
that’s ever been made Tom Hanks
and Meg Ryan Julia Roberts and
Richard Gere even Ellen DeGeneres
and Bill Pullman I’m a romantic
comedy whore I know what happens
I recognize the signs
David looks unsure Still he does not

KAREN (cont’d)

Boy meets girl boy gets girl

She rolls her eyes - could it be any simpler

KAREN

Youre at the top of your game
David Everyone wants to work with
you You’re heading up the biggest
project this company has ever seen -
you have to stay focused Don’t

ruin everything over Amanda

You

two didn’t work out for a reason

David There’s someone else
there for you Trust me

David tries to defend himself

DAVID

I wouldn’t jeopardize my work

KAREN

That’s what they all say right
before they go buy a boom box and a
trench coat and stand in their ex-
girlfriend’s yard playing Peter
Gabriel songs I’m telling you
there are plenty of fish in the
sea Amanda certainly figured that

out It’s time you did too
David nods Karen does have a good poi

KAREN (cont’d)

nt

David youre handsome and charming
and a girl would have to be out of

her mind not to fall for you

This seems to make David feel better

He tries to move on

DAVID
Thank you Karen So does that
mean you have any friends you could
set me up with

Karen stares at him thinking about this

INT EL COMPADRE - NIGHT

Dave and Pumpang sit next to each other in a booth at a cozy
little Mexican restaurant It reeks of romance - the
lighting the leather booths the uniformed waiters Pumpang
couldn’t look more uncomfortable

DAVID
Thanks for doing this buddy

PUMPANG
I must warn you David I am not
good at dating For generations we
have had only arranged marriages in
my family We are not bred for
rejection

DAVID
Youll be fine Karen’s a cute
girl you’1ll like her

PUMPANG
But will she like me

DAVID
Here they come

David stands up as Karen and her friend CHERYL walk over
KAREN

Hey Hope you haven’t been waiting
long David this is Cheryl

David shakes her hand
DAVID
Pleasure to meet you And Karen
this is Pumpang
KAREN
Hi Pumpang I’ve heard a lot
about you
Pumpang shakes Karen’s hand without making eye contact

PUMPANG
Hello

DAVID
So Cheryl how do you know Karen

CHERYL
We went to high school together
We were officers on the drill team

DAVID
That’s cool Pumpang and I went to
school together too College
Didn’t have a drill team there
though My ex-girlfriend actually
introduced us

Both girls look a bit uncomfortable with this information

DAVID (contd)
(catches himself)
I’m sorry That probably wasn’t
appropriate to mention an ex on a
first date was it
(trying to play it off)
Open mouth insert feet

Karen forces a laugh and turns to Cheryl

KAREN
I told you he was funny didn’t I

Cheryl smiles and takes a drink looking around

CHERYL
I like your taste in restaurants

DAVID
Thanks I used to come here all
the time with Amand--

Oof A DEAFENING SILENCE follows that one

DAVID (contd)
Sorry

Pumpang leans over and whispers to him

PUMPANG
I want to go home now

DAVID
(to the girls)
I don’t know what’s gotten into
me I’m really sorry
KAREN
David recently got out of a long
term relationship You’1ll have to
forgive him For being an idiot

DAVID
Right I didn’t mean to bring it
up but it is a funny story See
I love margaritas but I’m allergic
to tequila So “the girl who
will remain nameless” found this
place because they make the best
wine margaritas in the city
Believe it or not we actually had
our first date here

KAREN
And you thought this would be a
good place to bring us

David tries to cover the story - he points at a pifiata

DAVID
Did you know pifiatas originally
came from Italy The word
‘pignatta’ meaning fragile pot

Karen shakes her head Cheryl puts down her napkin

CHERYL
Maybe this wasn’t such a good idea

DAVID
No It was Really
(giving in)
Look we went out for seven years
That’s a long time

KAREN
David

DAVID
I can say it now I took her for
granted I know I did Okay It
was my fault and I admit that
But in my defense commitment is
not an easy thing

Karen leans her head back - this is a disaster

DAVID (cont’d)
I know how much marriage means to
women I do Heck I thought
about it from time to time I even
planned out how I was gonna do it -
at a UB40 concert

(MORE)

DAVID (contd)
They’re our favorite band Right
as they start “Red Red Wine”
which was our song I’d get down on
a knee and pop the question Not
bad huh

Pumpang starts looking pleadingly at people walking by

DAVID (contd)
Maybe have confetti or balloons
come down too I don’t know that
might be too cheesy But the point
is I did think about it And I
realize I wasn’t ready before but
now I know I am

David looks at the girls for some validation but finds none

DAVID (cont’d)
How about we just order

Karen and Cheryl get up from the table

KAREN
Goodbye David

DAVID
Wait I promise I won’t mention
Amanda again Or Red Red Wine

The MARIACHI BAND strolling by hears David and immediately
launches into a mariachi-infused version of “Red Red Wine”

MARIACHI
Vino dos rojos

David tries to stop the band but it’s too late

DAVID
No No Vino dos Rojos
(to the girls)
Karen Cheryl please Don’t go

Cheryl is already gone Karen shakes her head and follows

PUMPANG
This is why I do not like dating

INT DAVID’S CAR - NIGHT

David drives home quietly Pumpang eats out of a doggie bag
Finally David speaks

DAVID
You know tonight just made it
totally clear to me

(MORE)
DAVID (contd)
I don’t want to date anyone else
It’s been staring me in the face
for months now I’ve been
miserable without even knowing it
I still love Amanda

PUMPANG
But you can’t She has Sebastian

DAVID
I know but she’d take me back
wouldn’t she I mean this guy is
probably just her way of dealing
with our breakup A rebound guy

Pumpang looks over at David putting his food down

PUMPANG
I do not think Sebastian is a
rebound situation David They
really seem to like each other

DAVID
Give me a break

PUMPANG
No it’s the truth This is very
hard for me David I always
wanted you and Amanda to be
together When I first heard about
Sebastian I wanted to hate him
too but I just can’t He is a
good person Kind He’s much more
approachable than you’d think for
someone so rich and handsome And
Amanda she seems so happy

David SLAMS ON THE BRAKES and glares at Pumpang

DAVID

What kind of friend are you
PUMPANG

Huh
DAVID

I don’t even know you anymore
Pumpang It’s bad enough you tell
me what a great guy this guy is
but now you’re on his side After
all these years we spent together
the three of us I thought maybe
I’d earned the benefit of the
doubt I guess I was wrong

David reaches over and opens the door for Pumpang

DAVID (contd)
You want to betray our friendship
for some male model doctor fine
That’s your choice

Pumpang looks shocked to the core

DAVID (cont’d)
So long Pumpang Enjoy your new
life with Mr Perfect

Pumpang grabs his nachos and sadly gets out as David speeds
off into the night Pumpang looks around confused

PUMPANG
This is nowhere near campus

INT DAVID’S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

David sits on the beanbag sunken in eating from a pint of
Haagen Dazs a box of tissues to his side He is watching
HOME MOVIES of Amanda and him from back in the good ol’ days

ON TV - They sit on the couch in pajamas opening Christmas
gifts Watching the memories David smiles They are soon
joined by the RAT we saw earlier He waddles over next to
them The camera immediately moves away - Pumpang is clearly
doing the shooting

Amanda gets up and runs into the kitchen returning with a
piece of cheese David still looks slightly uneasy about the
rat but Amanda convinces him it’s okay She hands him the
cheese convincing him to feed the little critter

Watching David smiles On TV he takes the cheese and holds
it out for the rat The rat hesitates then CHOMPS down on
the cheese - and David’s finger Everyone including Pumpang
behind the camera panics The camera is set on the floor as
they tend to David and his injured finger

A CUT and we find David and Amanda in the EMERGENCY ROOM
David winces as the DOCTOR gives him a RABIES SHOT

Back in the here and now David laughs then after a beat
begins bawling He BLOWS his nose loudly

Later David is passed out on the beanbag as the movies play
on He looks awful Empty pints of ice cream are scattered
on the floor along with dozens of balled up tissues

INT DAVID’S OFFICE - DAY

David is hard at work head down tapping and clicking away
at his computer

KAREN (0S)
David

DAVID
Yeah

He looks up and Karen at the door sees that his eyes are
bleary from crying lack of sleep or both

KAREN
Are you okay

DAVID
Yeah I’m fine

KAREN
Right well I don’t think you and
Cheryl are going to work out

DAVID
That’s okay She seemed nice

Karen shakes her head

KAREN
She thought you were a jerk And
she’s pissed at me Thanks a lot
(changing the subject)
So how’s the Opera House coming

DAVID
I haven’t started yet

KAREN
So what are you working so
diligently on

DAVID
I’m burning a mix CD

David spins the monitor around proudly On the screen is a
large Photoshopped picture of David and Amanda kissing with
a heart wreathed around them and little Cupids all around

He clicks a button and UB40’S “Fools Rush In” starts to play

DAVID (contd)
I used to do it all the time back
when we first started dating Of
course they were mix tapes back
then and you didn’t “burn” them
You taped them Not anymore
though This is state of the art

David pops a CD into a fully decorated jewel case that reads
“SONGS IN THE KEY OF AMANDA” He shows it to Karen

DAVID (cont’d)
There’s some quality stuff in
there Lots of UB40 I can burn
you one if you want

Karen does not appear to want any such disc She goes over
to the wall and UNPLUGS the computer power strip The song
ends and the computer blinks out

DAVID (contd)
What are you doing

KAREN
Saving you from yourself David
(beat concerned)
Youve Got Mail

DAVID
I do

KAREN
No The movie Tom Hanks is a big
shot bookstore owner who falls for
Meg Ryan who runs this dinky
little corner bookshop He’s
putting her out of business
expanding his empire until he
falls in love Then it all goes to
hell Tom Hanks was an idiot
David Don’t you be

David plugs his computer back in He clicks a few buttons
and “Red Red Wine” starts to play He smiles hearing it

DAVID
Thanks for the advice Karen but
I’m pretty sure I’m smarter than
Tom Hanks

Before Karen can protest any more Rich comes in

RICH
Huh I’m sorry I must have the
wrong office I was looking for
Prism Architecture - not American
Fucking Bandstand

David quickly clicks it off straightening up

DAVID
Uh sorry about that I was

RICH
No I’m joking Play your stupid
music Whatever gets you inspired
I prefer porn but that’s just me

Karen silently excuses herself ducking out

RICH (contd)
Let’s see what you got on the Opera
deal so far

DAVID
(stalling)
Well I uh don’t really have

Rich picks up the CD case David was working on

RICH
“Songs in the Key of Amanda” What
the fuck album is that

He flips it over and finds the picture of David and Amanda

RICH (contd)
Oh I get it You put on the CD
think of all the good times and rub
one out I been there

DAVID
(slightly horrified)
Uh no That’s not what it’s for

RICH
You’re telling me you don’t spank
it to your ex-wife

DAVID

She’s not my ex-wife sir and I
don’t feel comfortable talking
about masturbation with y--

RICH
(ignoring him)
You damn well better jerk off
Can’t have anything blocking the
creative flow Especially now
Youve got a lot on your plate

David couldn’t be more miserable He is speechless

RICH (contd)
“Stuck in a rut Catch a nut”
That’s what my father used to say
He was a very wise man

DAVID
Sounds like it sir

RICH
Now get back to work I’m not
paying you to talk about your wang

Rich exits David lets out an audible sigh of relief But
it’s short-lived as Rich pokes his head back in

RICH (contd)
Listen I got a dinner tonight I
think you should join

DAVID
Dinner

RICH
It’s for the opera house Want to
discuss a few budget issues that
kind of thing Seven oclock

DAVID
(reluctant)
Okay

Rich leaves David goes back to downloading power ballads

INT PORSCHE - NIGHT

Rich drives David sits shotgun Usher blasts on the stereo

Rich cuts

RICH
So listen David We’re off the
clock now It’s just you and me

DAVID
Well yeah I guess but I thought
this was a business dinner

RICH
How’s the opera project coming

DAVID
Well I’m still trying to work up
some preliminary designs but--

him off

RICH

Okay we talked business I got a
sandwich in the glove box if you
want dinner

(beat)
Now let’s talk about you David
brutal honesty time here your
story though unique to you is not
unique We’ve all been dumped
Yes Saunders even me

DAVID
I’m not sure I follow you sir

RICH
I may be your boss but I like to
think there’s more to it than that
I take a vested interest in my most
important employees I want you to
know I’m here for you

David looks at Rich not sure exactly how to take that

DAVID
That’s very kind of you

RICH
It’s not kindness it’s smart
business I’ve got a lot riding on
you Can’t afford to have an
employee’s love life get in the way
of a job well done

DAVID
Honestly I’m doing fine

RICH
(not buying it)
I’ve had my heart broken more times
than I can count I’ve been to
rock bottom and lived to tell about
it I feel your pain David And
I know how to make it better

DAVID
You do

Rich pulls into a strip mall parks in a spot in front of a
liquor store and looks David in the eye

RICH
Yes I do The secret to emotional
recovery is two simple words

Rich counts the words on his fingers

RICH (contd)
Hand Job

David opens his mouth but nothing comes out

RICH (contd)
I defy you to find a therapy more
therapeutic both physical and
emotional than the loving stroke
of an anonymous hand job That
moment of release I swear you’ll
never feel more alive Then you’1ll
forget all about what’s-—her-name
and be ready to get back to work

He nods in the direction of a storefront with a sign reading
SILK ROAD PALACE MASSAGE PARLOR

DAVID
Rich listen I do not want - or
need - a hand job

RICH
Saunders I know you haven’t done
shit on the concert hall If you
don’t come up with something
brilliant soon we’re going to lose
this job and Ill personally slit
your throat That’s a promise
Now as your boss I am telling you
- go in there and get a hand job
That’s an order

Rich gets out of the car After a long beat David follows

INT SILK ROAD PALACE MASSAGE PARLOR - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

Rich enters wearing a smile as big as Texas David follows
close behind wearing a look of trepidation just as big
From behind a beaded curtain emerges an older MADAM in a
cheap kimono It is immediately clear she recognizes Rich

MADAM

Mister Rich You so hansome
RICH

Midori you are as gorgeous as a

sunrise
Rich takes her hand and kisses it suavely She giggles

MADAM
You bring friend Very hansome

RICH
Yes he is David this is Midori

David just nods and smiles uncomfortably
RICH (contd)
Midori I want you to set David up
with your best girl On me
David quickly jumps in

DAVID
Just a regular massage actually

MADAM
(confused)
No yankee wankee

DAVID
No thank you

MADAM
Soo Shin Min Soo

A not terribly cute ASIAN GIRL in a kimono emerges and bows

RICH
Ah sweet Soo Shin My pretty
Oriental flower

Rich steps forward and takes her by the hand kisses it

RICH (contd)
She’s got the softest hands And
the warmest heart See you later

And they’re gone The madam and David share an awkward few
moments until another bigger older less attractive ASIAN
WOMAN in a kimono pushes her way through the beaded curtain
She BLOWS HER NOSE into a kleenex and empties a bag of cough
drops into her mouth with her other hand

She steps forward and takes David by the hand David still
uncertain and uncomfortable hesitates She does not

INT MASSAGE PARLOR - PRIVATE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

It’s a tiny room with a not very sanitary looking massage
table in the middle Balled up kleenexes are scattered on
the floor Min Soo takes a not very sanitary looking towel
and drapes it over the table

MIN SOO
Take off clothes

DAVID
Oh Okay You know no wankee
yankee right Just massage

Min Soo just stares at him

MIN SOO
Take off clothes

David strips down to his boxers She points at them

MIN SOO (cont’d)
Take off

Reluctantly David does

DAVID
Is there some kind of robe or--

MIN SOO
Get on table

Not really sure he has a choice David does lying on his
stomach his head face down in the padded donut-shaped hole

MIN SOO (cont’d)
You want nuts

DAVID
No I told you regular--

He sees her holding out an open tin of MIXED NUTS

DAVID (contd)
Oh no thank you

Min Soo grabs a bottle of oil and begins drizzling it all
over David’s back as she crunches her cough drops

DAVID (cont’d)
Ooh That’s warm

Min Soo begins rubbing It doesn’t look like she’s fully
accredited but he is finding it surprisingly relaxing

MIN SOO
You have girlfriend

until now

DAVID
No I mean yes I did But not
anymore

Min Soo moves around the table rubbing and crunching

MIN SOO
Sad story

DAVID

Yeah I guess you probably hear
that a lot though huh

(relaxing David gives in)
I screwed up is what happened Let
her get away And now she’s
probably having crazy sex with this
male modelcardiologist instead

Now Min Soo climbs onto the table fully straddling David
As she lowers her sizable girth onto him he lets out an
involuntary “OOF” as the air escapes his chest cavity

DAVID (contd)
The more I think about her the
more I can’t stop thinking about
her Know what I mean It’s a
vicious cycle

Min Soo lets out a HUGE VERY WET SNEEZE and with it tiny
chunks of cough drops which rain down sticking to Davids
back David tries to raise his head but she quickly puts

her large hand down stopping him She continues massaging

Min Soo reaches over and scoops out a handful of MIXED NUTS
She immediately begins crunching on the nuts Distracted
David ends his story as quickly as possible

DAVID (cont’d)
Ahhh Yeah so um now I just
wish I could get her back somehow

Min Soo unprompted begins to speak As she does her mouth
full bits of NUTS spill out and onto David’s naked back

MIN SOO
Love like massage Push too hard
hurt bad Not push hard enough
not massage Must push just right

ON DAVID’S FACE - her broken English has somehow broken
through to him Fully nude in a potentially contaminated
massage parlor David has experienced enlightenment

DAVID
Huh That makes sense sorta I
mean it’s a little vague for a
metaphor but I think I got it
You gotta push you just can’t push
too hard right

Without warning Min Soo SNEEZES violently onto Davids back
again showering him with tiny shards of nuts and worse

DAVID (cont’d)
Bless you

Min Soo climbs down off David

MIN SOO
Flip to finish

David raises his head

DAVID
I’m sorry

MIN SOO
(gesturing with her hand)
Flip to finish Happy ending

DAVID
Oh no thank you That’s okay
Enough rubbing No wankee yankee

He turns over and attempts to sit up Min Soo has taken oil
and squeezed it into her hand With her other hand she
holds David down as a large Asian cat might hold down a poor
defenseless mouse David squirms growing quite desperate

DAVID (contd)
Listen I appreciate everything
You were great The massage the
philosophy it was wonderful And
if you hand me my pants I’11l give
you a very generous tip

She is not handing him anything except a hand job She says
nothing but keeps him pinned down David looks on the verge
of tears Coldly wordlessly she goes in for the kill

ON DAVID’S FACE - his eyes WIDEN He can barely speak

DAVID (contd)
Help me

EXT PRISM PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Rich pulls up to the only car left in the lot - Davids
David opens the door and gets out of Rich’s sweet ride

DAVID
Well thanks for that

RICH
I told you it would help You look
like a changed man Saunders
Ready to take on the world

David couldn’t feel farther from it

DAVID
Sure

RICH
Good to hear See you bright and
early for the opera meeting Now
that your head is clear you got
all night to prepare

Though he barely seems to be listening David nods his head

RICH (contd)
You can shut the door now

David nods again absently closing the passenger door Rich

roars off peeling a good deal of rubber at David’s feet He
stands there dazed deep in thought Then he takes out his

cell phone and dials

DAVID
Hi I need an address

INT DAVID’S CAR - NIGHT

David sits his car parked The radio plays Cheap Trick’s
classic ballad “The Flame” He looks up and out the window

DAVIDS POV - Amanda’s darkened apartment Nothing stirs

Suddenly a few SNOWFLAKES fall onto David’s windshield
First only a couple then more and more David just stares
as the snow blankets his windshield

He turns on the wiper blades to reveal that he is parked on
the top of a mountain next to a ski lift He watches as

EXT MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY

David and Amanda are on a SKI TRIP - smiling just coming out
of the lodge with their skis They stuff them in the ground
and have a playful snowball fight Pumpang runs out of the
lodge and joins in just in time to be pelted by them

Amanda tackles David and they fall

EXT BEACH - DAY

-landing on a blanket on the beach now in their swim
suits They roll around kissing passionately their own
little From Here to Eternity scene

Pumpang calls to them - he’s a few yards away buried up to
his neck in sand He looks nervous as the tide rolls in
They get up and run right past him diving into the water

INT DAVID AND AMANDA’S OLD APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

-and emerging from a bathtub where they’ve been holding
their breath underwater They giggle and kiss and lather up
Dozens of candles set a romantic mood They continue to kiss
as the door opens and a slender brown arm reaches in handing
David a LOOFAH

The door quickly closes and David sets about erotically
loofahing Amanda She wears a look of ecstasy as he scrubs

The song FADES OUT and a loud KNOCKING is heard

EXT AMANDA’S APARTMENT - MORNING

CUT TO

Amanda is rapping on David’s window He jolts awake dazed

and disoriented and rolls down the window
look pleased

AMANDA
What are you doing here

David is not exactly prepared to explain
DAVID

Amanda Hey I’m just uh
waiting for someone I’m

carpooling It’s my turn to drive

AMANDA
And you sleep while you carpool

DAVID

I’ve been working some crazy hours

and the guy I’m picking up
Roger he’s always running late

Figured Id catch a little cat nap

(beat changing subject)
So what are you doing here

AMANDA
(cold)
I live here

DAVID
Seriously In that building
Wow That’s so weird That’s
where Roger lives too

(beat)
So what’s going on

AMANDA
Goodbye David

not

Amanda turns and walks back to her car which is running

DAVID
Okay well great seeing you

She closes her door without responding and drives off
watches her go then absently looks at his watch

David
DAVID (cont’d)
(panicked)
Aw shit

He cranks on the ignition and races away

INT PRISM OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Rich is waiting at the front doors when David enters

RICH
What’s wrong with you They’ve
been waiting for twenty minutes

DAVID
I’m sorry I had a long night

RICH
Well that better mean you have
some genius shit to say You look
like hell Now get in there and
wow them

Rich pushes open the doors to the conference room

INT PRISM CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
The Opera BOARD OF DIRECTORS stand milling about

RICH
Sorry to keep you all waiting

They filter to their seats with one particularly handsome

member taking the chair opposite David It’s Sebastian

SEBASTIAN
Not at all You must be David
Dr Sebastian Cole I can’t tell
you what an honor it is to finally
meet you

David has just realized who Sebastian is He is shocked

DAVID
You

SEBASTIAN
Yes I have to say it’s funny we
haven’t met before I feel like I
know you so well already

DAVID
You do

SEBASTIAN
I have the honor of being chief of
thoracic surgery at St Luke’s
Hospital I’ve been lucky enough
to roam the halls of your
meticulously designed cardio wing
I’m a huge fan And since I serve
as chairman of the Long Beach Opera
Society as well I must say David
I had no choice but to recommend
you to the board

DAVID
(still stunned)
Oh Uh huh

SEBASTIAN
You have an artist’s eye Not only
was your design practical and
efficient but something about it
was primal almost passionate -

On that word David experiences a

FLASH - A door flies open and Sebastian and Amanda enter her
apartment passionately making out

BACK TO REALITY - Though it was clearly a figment of David’s
imagination he is still rattled

SEBASTIAN (cont’d)
-which is exactly what we are
looking for

The board nod importantly at David David is a little too
confused at the moment to speak

SEBASTIAN (cont’d)
So perhaps you could share your
thoughts

DAVID
My thoughts

SEBASTIAN
Your vision Not everything of
course but just some ideas - what
you’re thinking

David can’t think of anything but the idea of Amanda and
Sebastian together Rich nudges David not so subtly

RICH
David

DAVID
Yes uh well I was thinking

The board waits expectantly leaning forward in anticipation

DAVID (cont’d)
Maybe it would be best for you to
tell me what you’re looking for

Rich closes his eyes

SEBASTIAN
Can you beat that An artist anda
team player How refreshing

Sebastian shakes his head appreciatively

SEBASTIAN (cont’d)
Well since you asked Mr
Saunders I can describe what we
want in a concert hall with one
word Perfection

DAVID
I’m sorry

SEBASTIAN
Perfection And not the perfection
of a scientific discovery or a
never before solved math equation
No we’re looking for a more
emotional affecting perfection

David looks utterly lost

SEBASTIAN (cont’d)
The perfection you find in the
subtle curves and the soft feel of
say the feminine form

Another FLASH - Sebastian and Amanda are in her bedroom now
still passionately kissing tearing off clothes their hands
and mouths exploring the perfection of each other’s bodies

BACK TO REALITY - David is more than rattled His face is
drained of color his mouth is dry he looks faint

Trying to recover David picks up a glass and pours himself
some water hoping it will end But Sebastian goes on

SEBASTIAN (cont’d)
We want our patrons to experience
exhilaration when they walk in
The kind you feel when you see your
lover nude for the first time

FLASH - Sebastian and Amanda are a tangled mass of flesh
rolling around on her bed making wonderful sweet love

BACK TO REALITY - David looks nothing short of haunted

SEBASTIAN (cont’d)
Something majestic An ecstasy of
both the eye and ear that will
simply take the breath away--

FLASH - Amanda is on top of Sebastian They climax

BACK TO REALITY - David drops the glass of water It
SHATTERS on the table Everyone turns to see David looking
like a shell of himself

SEBASTIAN (contd)
I’m sorry if I get a little carried
away It’s just that when I’m
passionate about something I can’t
help myself

That doesn’t help David feel any better

SEBASTIAN (cont’d)
But you asked That’s our dream
our goal for our concert hall
David utter perfection

David is speechless Fortunately Rich is not

RICH
Sounds like a plan Thank you all
for coming out David will get to
work and well have preliminary
designs in the next couple weeks

SEBASTIAN
Fantastic We really can’t thank
you enough David such a pleasure
meeting with you

As the board stands Sebastian offers David his hand It
hovers there over the table for a few moments David staring
at it wondering what secret parts of Amanda it has explored

David finally takes it grimacing at Sebastian’s firm grasp

DAVID
Uh huh

Sebastian and the other board members file out David stands
there frozen in his spot

DAVID (cont’d)
I can’t do this

RICH
Sure you can Youve just got a
little performance anxiety Weve
all been there You want me to
call Min Soo order up a little
lunch hour house call

DAVID
No Thanks I think I’m just
going to go get some air

David walks out not quite himself

EXT DEARHEART SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY

It’s recess time and KIDS are all over the place running
screaming doing their thing One particular game of grab-
ass looks to be getting out of hand though as a CHUBBY GIRL
who is being chased by a MEAN BOY takes a tumble wiping out

Amanda hurries to the Chubby Girl helps her up and dusts her
off The Chubby Girl is crying so Amanda comforts her

KAREN (0S)

(on phone)
Rich is looking for you Says it’s
important Who’s Min Soo

DAVID
(not interested)
She’s a masseuse

We pull back to see David watching the goings-on from his
car which is parked behind a chain link fence by the
playground He is on his cell phone

INTERCUT WITH - INT DAVID’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Karen hears kids PLAYING in the background

KAREN
Where are you

DAVID
Lunch

On the passenger seat sits David’s lunch - sandwich chips
Snapple a Twix candy bar He eats while he watches On the
playground Amanda is sitting with the Chubby Girl

AMANDA
Don’t worry honey We’ll go puta
couple band-aids on there and no
one will even notice

CHUBBY GIRL
Yes they will I’m supposed to be
in the talent show

AMANDA
No one’1ll care if you have skinned
knees or not All theyll see is
how talented you are

The little girl SMILES Amanda has worked a miracle - the
chubby girl is now smiling And David is captivated by it

DAVID
My God she’s amazing

KAREN
You’re at that school again aren’t
you I thought she told you you
weren’t allowed there

DAVID
I’m not on school grounds I just
happened to be driving by

KAREN
David I’m warning you you are
headed for disaster Move on
before it’s too late They didn’t
call it Five Weddings It was Four
Weddings and a Funeral A funeral
David

David is not paying attention He watches the chubby girl
back to frolicking - because of Amanda

DAVID
Tell me how this sounds

He picks up a GREETING CARD with a CLOWN on the front

DAVID (cont’d)
It’s a card with a clown on the
front and inside it says “ I’m
not clowning around - I want you”

Karen looks both confused and disturbed

DAVID (contd)
Clowns are like an inside joke with
us We went to this circus once
There were all these clowns Have
I ever told you about that

KAREN
That’s okay

go

DAVID
So this is what I wrote inside
(reading)

“My sweet little thing I can’t
stop thinking about you I wait
for that school bell to ring
dreaming that you’1ll race into my
arms and kiss me with your soft

tiny lips I don’t care if it’s

right or wrong I want you so

badly Love me again”

David finishes He waits for a response

DAVID (contd)
So what do you think

KAREN
Please come back to work

DAVID
I will I just need to give her
this I’11l see you soon

David hangs up puts the card in its envelope and closes it
He looks back to the playground where Amanda is still
working her sweet magic By now a familiar YOUNG BOY is
playing with a ball by the fence close to where David sits

observing

He gets out of his car and approaches the kid

DAVID (contd)
Hey What’s your name

DONNIE
Donnie

DAVID
Hey Donnie

David pulls the Twix bar out of his pocket and holds it out

DAVID (contd)

You like candy I’11 tell you what
- this is a very special card it’s
for a very special person I’1l
give you this Twix bar if you take
this over to that lady over there--

Donnie quickly takes both the candy and the card

DAVID (cont’d)
Okay now just go hand it to Miss
Fitzgerald okay You got it

But by now Donnie has turned and is walking away

DAVID (cont’d)
Hey Donnie No She’s over
there Don’t walk away You need
to give that to Miss Fitzgerald

At this point though Donnie is out of hearing range And
nowhere near Amanda He sits on the swing set holding the
card and eating the candy bar Another teacher an older
stern looking teacher MISS ESSEX approaches Donnie

DAVID (contd)
Oh no Don’t do that

The Teacher takes the card from Donnie and opens it

DAVID (contd)
Donnie you idiot Wrong teacher
Don’t let her read that

But she is reading it Horrified she questions Donnie
sternly Donnie points at David by the fence

DAVID (cont’d)
Oh shit

David instantly panics turning tail and running back to his
car as Miss Essex heads toward him By the time he gets in
and turns the ignition the Teacher is in a full-on sprint
David hauls ass out of there just before she gets to the
fence and hopefully before she can read the license plate

INT DAVID’S OFFICE - NIGHT

Again David’s is one of the only lights on in the office
He sits at his drawing table trying to work on a set of
designs But he can’t Finally he gives up He sighs
stands up walks out and turns off the light

We are left in utter darkness Sort of like David

INT AMANDA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The DOORBELL RINGS and Sebastian dressed sharply opens it
It’s Pumpang and he is dressed far more casually

SEBASTIAN
Pumpang Hey what a surprise

PUMPANG
I had no plans tonight so I
thought I would teach you how to
play bridge like we talked about

Pumpang hands Sebastian a few decks of cards and lets himself
in parking his scooter and taking off his jacket

SEBASTIAN
Oh that sounds fun Pumpang I
wish you would have called earlier

PUMPANG
It’s okay I don’t mind being
spontaneous Where is Amanda

SEBASTIAN
She’s getting dressed See we
kind of have plans already

PUMPANG
That’s fine Bridge can wait So
what are we doing

SEBASTIAN
Well actually I meant “we” as in
Amanda and I I thought maybe the
three of us could take a break and
Amanda and I could go out for a
nice romantic evening We haven’t
had a real “date” in a while

The harsh reality of the situation hits Pumpang like a knee
in the crotch He tries not to let on that he’s hurt

PUMPANG
Oh

SEBASTIAN
You don’t mind do you

PUMPANG
No it’s fine No big whoop You
are dating you should go on dates

The DOORBELL RINGS again Sebastian opens it Jim and
Cindy also dressed formally enter greeting Sebastian
Pumpang does the math He is not pleased

PUMPANG (cont’d)
Or double dates as the case may
be

CINDY
Can you believe it We’re actually
early for once in our lives
(beat - noticing)
Oh Pumpang You’re here

PUMPANG
Not for long I am not

Pumpang goes to get his scooter and yanks his decks of cards
from Sebastian’s hand

SEBASTIAN
Pumpang wait Why don’t you at
least stay for a glass of wine

PUMPANG
No thank you I can see I am not
necessary Have a lovely time on
your date Your double date

He awkwardly tries to open the door while maneuvering his
scooter

JIM
See you soon Pumpang

Cindy elbows Jim in the stomach shushing him Pumpang
crashes his way out the door and with that he’s gone

EXT AMANDA’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Pumpang exits the building As he tries unsuccessfully to
start up his scooter a hushed VOICE stops him cold

DAVID
Hey Pumpang Over here

Pumpang ducks pulls out a KNIFE from the sole of his shoe
and wields it spinning around afraid Then he notices
David waving from his car across the street his window down

PUMPANG
David

DAVID
Geez Pumpang What the hell is
that You got a knife in your
shoe

Pumpang comes over to the car He slides the hidden knife
back into the heel of his sneaker

PUMPANG
The slums of Delhi teach you to be
prepared I have lost too many
cousins to random violence I will
not become a statistic

DAVID
Well be careful with that thing

Pumpang looks in the car at David
PUMPANG
What are you doing here

DAVID
Just driving by Checking things
out
(beat confessing)
I can’t sleep unless I know where
she is

PUMPANG
That sounds crazy David

DAVID
I know But I just want to know
she’s okay Sometimes I wait here
just to see her leave for school in
the morning I can’t help it

Pumpang sighs deeply He looks at his old friend

PUMPANG
He’s up there you know

They both stare up at Amanda’s apartment

DAVID
I know
(sad beat)
Well I don’t mean to take up your
time Just thought I’d say hey

A tear rolls down Pumpang’s cheek David notices

DAVID (cont’d)
What’s the matter

PUMPANG
I was wrong David

DAVID
About what

PUMPANG
About him You were right He may
be handsome and intelligent and as
close to flawless as I have ever
met but he is not right for her

David is excited and relieved
DAVID

Are you serious You really mean
that Pumpang

Pumpang nods vigorously then runs around and jumps in the
car They have an emotional reunion hug in the front seat

PUMPANG
I missed you David

DAVID
I missed you too buddy

They finally let go

PUMPANG
I want to help you win her back

DAVID
That’s great man This is
perfect Now we just need to come
up with some sort of plan I guess

Pumpang nods slowly He knows exactly what this means

PUMPANG
Start the car
DAVID
What about your scooter
PUMPANG
I can get it later We have work

to do

INT SPY STORE - NIGHT

Pumpang and David find themselves in a store filled with high-
tech gadgets A SHADY GUY in a shiny suit is on the phone
behind the counter talking in a low voice When he sees
Pumpang he comes out from behind the counter and hugs him

SHADY GUY
Pumpang How are you my friend

PUMPANG
Very well Hassan this is my best
friend David He needs equipment

SHADY GUY
Of course No problem I fix you
up Anything you want I give you
discount I’11 be right back

Hassan goes behind the counter to finish his phone call

DAVID
You know that guy

PUMPANG
Of course He used to be married
to one of my cousins Until she
died I buy all my mace from him

Pumpang starts looking through the display cases

PUMPANG (cont’d)
You want a shoe knife too

Pumpang pulls his out again David shakes his head

DAVID
(quiet to Pumpang)
Look I don’t think I really need
any of this stuff

PUMPANG
David they have everything here
Spy cameras lock picks anything
you could possibly want for all
your surveillance desires

DAVID
I’m trying to get her back not
steal her identity

PUMPANG
David you know I love you But
you are not very smart sometimes

(beat)

You are never going to get Amanda
back just by wishing it to happen
I wished for many years that my
family would love me but that wish
did not come true

DAVID
So what do I do

PUMPANG

You dated her for seven years and
yet still you do not know her You
do not know her heart That is why
she is with someone else She is
hoping she will find someone who
truly understands her in here

(points to his chest)
If you want to defeat Sebastian
you have to relearn all you thought
you knew about her You must find
her heart before that evil doctor
model steals it away for good

DAVID
Okay So how

PUMPANG
Give me your credit card my
friend

David takes out his wallet and hands Pumpang his Platinum
card Hassan notices and quickly hangs up the phone

EXT STREET - DAY

An EXTREME CLOSE-UP of Amanda that keeps going in and out of
focus She sits at an outdoor cafe having coffee with Cindy

DAVID (0S)
Can you make out what they’re
saying

The view suddenly turns ALIEN - orange and red pixilated
versions of Amanda and Cindy drinking red cups of coffee

Suddenly the view goes away as Pumpang lowers a very
advanced pair of BINOCULARS from his eyes We are

EXT PARK BENCH —- DAY

-which is over a block away Pumpang turns to David
slightly annoyed He shuts off the binoculars

PUMPANG
No What is wrong with this stupid
junk I can’t get them to work
right And it does not help that
the instructions are in Chinese -
which I cannot read

Pumpang hands him the binoculars and flips through the
Chinese instruction book David looks through the scope

DAVID
Wow These are powerful I can
see Cindy’s pores from here Man
she’s got some serious crows feet
under all that make up

Pumpang throws down the instructions frustrated

PUMPANG
You cannot learn about Amanda’s
feelings if we cannot hear what she
is saying Hand me that bag

David puts the binoculars down gets Pumpang’s black duffle
bag from next to him on the bench and hands it over
PUMPANG (cont’d)
We’1ll get to the bottom of this

He unzips the bag

OVER AT THE CAFE - Cindy puts down her coffee

AT THE BENCH - Pumpang pulls out a BIONIC EAR listening
Basically a microphone mounted to a dish with

device

CINDY
You are so lucky Yeah yeah
Jim’s fine but what I wouldn’t do
for a guy like Sebastian

AMANDA
I know he’s amazing but

CINDY
But what Are you kidding me I
defy you to find one fault in that
adonis You don’t get better than
that missy

earphones attached

DAVID
What the hell is that

PUMPANG
A bionic ear listening device It
can pick up a whisper at 150 yards

DAVID
You know how to work it

PUMPANG
There were no instructions with
this one I can figure it out

BACK AT THE CAFE - Amanda looks at her hands knowing what

Cindy’s reaction will be to what she is about to say

AMANDA
I saw David yesterday

Cindy nearly chokes

CINDY
You stop that right now You are
over him

AMANDA
Oh I know But lately I’ve had
this strange feeling you know
Like he’s always nearby Watching
over me somehow

CINDY
It’s called stalking Amanda I
dated a very successful criminal
defense attorney I’1l get you a
restraining order Say the word

AMANDA
No it’s not like that Davids
harmless

CINDY

Harmless

BACK AT THE BENCH - Pumpang finally manages to switch the
Bionic Ear on

PUMPANG
Here we go

They put on headphones and aim the device at the cafe

AT THE CAFE - Cindy is just winding up her tirade pounding
her fist down

CINDY
WAKE UP AMANDA

AT THE BENCH - The volume on the headphones was up so loud
all that is heard is a wild FEEDBACK noise whistling at
eardrum ripping levels Pumpang and David both throw off
their headphones holding their ears in pain

DAVID
What the hell Pumpang

PUMPANG
What did you say I cannot hear
I can feel my ears bleeding inside

Through his ear trauma David notices the girls get up He
grabs the binoculars - Amanda and Cindy are hugging goodbye

DAVID

Uh oh We have movement
PUMPANG

What
DAVID

Forget it Just be quiet
Amanda walks down the street to THE PILATES STOP

DAVID (contd)
No wonder she’s been looking so
good

(MORE)

DAVID (cont’d)
She was always into that yoga
stuff I didn’t know she was still
doing it
(beat)
I’1l be back

Pumpang sits rubbing his ears as David crosses the street

PUMPANG
What a terrible way to live Never
again to hear the chirping of a
bird

INT ZEN YOGA - LATER

David walks up to the front desk He looks through the glass
into the workout room It takes him a moment but he
eventually spots Amanda stretching out on a mat

YOGA FRONT DESK GIRL

DAVID
Yes Id like to sign up

YOGA FRONT DESK GIRL
Do you have a membership here

DAVID
No I don’t What do I need to do

YOGA FRONT DESK GIRL
500 initiation fee and 150 a
month not including class fees

David takes out his wallet
DAVID

So how much will it cost to get in
that class right now

She turns to look at the class going on behind her

YOGA FRONT DESK GIRL
Advanced Level 3 Ooh I’m sorry -

need to graduate from Level 1 and 2
before you can be invited to join
the Advanced session

DAVID
Look I really want to be in that

He quickly demonstrates touching his toes Sadly he can’t

DAVID (cont’d)
Ow

David looks at her pleadingly She takes his credit card

INT YOGA WORKOUT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Class is already going The yoga GURU gives instructions

GURU
And back to downward dog

David enters in brand new yoga gear and carrying a brand new
yoga mat He makes his way through the people with their
asses up in the air and finds a spot right behind Amanda

GURU (cont’d)
Moving over to Right Facing
Warrior

As David gets settled Amanda notices him behind her

AMANDA
David

DAVID

(false shock)
Amanda Hey What do you know
How’s it going

AMANDA
Since when do you take yoga

DAVID
Oh well it’s just something I’ve
recently gotten into I’m trying
to expand my athletic horizons

GURU
And down into Sleeping Fig Leaf

The class may know what that means but David has no idea
Amanda folds herself into a very difficult position and David
does his best to imitate it

DAVID
So everything good with you

AMANDA
David we really shouldn’t be
talking
DAVID
Why not We’re adults

aren’t we--

Before he can finish the Guru appears next to David

GURU
I said Sleeping Fig Lea

David is the only one in the class

DAVID
Right Yeah you know
Level 1 and 2 from a dif
dojo and they must have

f
not doing it right
I took

ferent
skipped

that one cause I’m not familiar

The Guru grabs David’s arm and pull

DAVID (cont’d)
Whoa hey Take it easy

The Guru grabs David’s leg and pull

DAVID (cont’d)
Wow Okay Not so hard

ls it down to the mat

there

ls it up and over his head

there

okay I’ve got an old hamstring

injury that flares-- AHHH

The Guru pins David to the floor and leans his knee into his

back pressing and contorting him

With a final loud POP

David achieves the position The Guru nods

GURU
The Sleeping Fig Leaf

David is in severe pain his face turning red

DAVID
Ow

GURU
Back to Warrior One

The entire class shifts positions

Everyone that is except

David He is still frozen contorted clearly in pain

DAVID
(unmoving)

You all go ahead I’11 catch up

INT PUMPANG’S DORM ROOM - LATER

Pumpang is sticking cow stickers around an old photo of a
LARGE INDIAN FAMILY (presumably his)

PUMPANG
So What did she say

DAVID (0S)
We didn’t get much chance to talk

PULL BACK to reveal David is lying on his back in the middle
of Pumpang’s floor A layer of ice packs are under him

DAVID (contd)
They look scrawny but those yoga
dudes can really cop an attitude

Pumpang does not seem to be paying much attention to David

DAVID (cont’d)
I’1l tell you something though I
think I get it now

PUMPANG
Get what

DAVID
The whole yoga thing I used to
think it was a big waste of time
which is probably why Amanda
stopped doing it after a while
But for a second there even though
I was in extreme pain and my back
felt like it was going to snap in
half and spray spinal fluid all
over the woman behind me there was
this momentary feeling of peace

PUMPANG
I can imagine

DAVID
I mean it It was like this whole
body mind and soul thing

David pulls himself up to a seated position

DAVID (contd)
I feel bad that I was the one who
kept her away from all that

PUMPANG
Great We’ve all learned something
then Now if your back is no
longer broken we should get going

He holds up a GPS device with an LCD map on it

PUMPANG (cont’d)
The Rose Bowl beckons

Pumpang helps David up

DAVID
You’re tracking her car How much
is this costing me

PUMPANG
You cannot put a price tag on love

EXT ROSE BOWL - OUTDOOR FLEA MARKET - DAY

It’s a beautiful day and hundreds of people are milling
around searching the booths for good deals and antiques
Among the masses is a guy in a BASEBALL CAP and SUNGLASSES
trying to look discreet This is David

PUMPANG (0OS)
(through a quiet speaker)
Eagle to Falcon what’s your 20

David lifts up a tiny handheld WALKIE TALKIE to his mouth

DAVID
(into walkie)
You mean where am I

PUMPANG (0OS)
Yes Over

DAVID
I’m by a booth that’s selling lots
of wicker Where are you

PUMPANG (0S)

Trying to achieve optimal

visibility
REVEAL Pumpang is standing on top of a PICK-UP TRUCK peering
through the fancy binoculars He looks frustrated

PUMPANG (cont’d)
I cannot turn off the infra-red I
am unable to locate Golden Egg

BACK TO DAVID - picking up small crappy looking items

DAVID
You mean Amanda

PUMPANG
Roger that Why would she come to
this horrible place

DAVID
She always loved this kind of crap
Which I never understood Why buy
used when you can get it brand new

PUMPANG
It is not the knick-knacks and
tchotchkes that bother me It is
the crowds Twice as a child I was
nearly trampled at a spice market

DAVID
Yeah well people can get crazy
when they’re bargain hunting

David picks up a CERAMIC CHICKEN just as another hand does
too The hand belongs to Amanda

PUMPANG’S POV - finally the binoculars focus He panics
PUMPANG (0S)
(on walkie)
Abort ABORT

AMANDA
David

David caught off guard quickly hides his walkie talkie

DAVID
Hey Fancy seeing you here

AMANDA
(instantly suspicious)
Are you following me

DAVID
What No Of course not I just
wanted to check out the whole flea
marketantiquing scene you know

Amanda does not look convinced David quickly continues
DAVID (contd)
In fact I was just trying to find
out how much this lovely ceramic
chicken cost Sir
David gets the attention of the Antique Guy

ANTIQUE GUY
Fifteen dollars

David gives him a “youve gotta be shitting me” look

DAVID
For a used chicken

ANTIQUE GUY
Twenty

DAVID
This guy doesn’t even know how to
negotiate properly

ANTIQUE GUY
Twenty-five

David puts down the chicken and turns to Amanda

AMANDA
But I thought you hated antiques

DAVID
What No I don’t “Hate” is such
a strong word
(beat)
What about you What drives your
passion for the antique arts

Amanda seems a little suspicious but she answers anyway

AMANDA
I dont know It’s just everything
here has a history Some unique
story of where it’s been how it
came to be here When you find
something you like you can be a
part of its story

David can only nod his head captivated by her answer

AMANDA (cont’d)
Then again on a certain level I
can identify with this stuff too
Getting discarded tossed aside I
think at some point in our lives
we all feel like cast-offs

That one hit a little close to home

SEBASTIAN
I can’t imagine anyone ever
voluntarily throwing you away
baby They’d have to be crazy

Both turn to find Sebastian standing there looking handsome
He moves in for a kiss Only then does he notice David

SEBASTIAN (cont’d)
David Well what do you know
How fantastic is this I had no
idea you had a case of the antique
fever too

DAVID
Um well I sure do

SEBASTIAN
Amanda honey this is David
Saunders He’s doing our concert--

AMANDA
We know each other

SEBASTIAN
No kidding What a small world

DAVID
You mean you don’t know
(looking at Amanda)
She never told you

Amanda looks back at him Apparently not
DAVID (cont’d)
We dated for seven years I’m her
ex-boyfriend
A beat Sebastian smiles
SEBASTIAN

How funny is that I guess we both
have pretty darn good taste huh

AMANDA
So you don’t mind

SEBASTIAN
Not if you don’t History is
history am I right David

David doesn’t really have a good answer to that
SEBASTIAN (contd)
Speaking of which I want to show
you both something David I think
youll really get a kick out of it
EXT ROSE BOWL - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

David Amanda and Sebastian stand at the rear of a pick up
truck In its bed sits a GORGEOUS WOODEN CHEST

SEBASTIAN

Striking isn’t it This gorgeous
seventeenth century oak chest
belonged to William Brewster In
1620 he packed his belongings in
this chest along with those of his
wife Abigail and daughters Emily
and Susanna He also packed two
barrels of wheat an iron pot and
roughly 26 square feet of canvas
along with his hopes and dreams for
a new life Then he his family
and this chest boarded a ship
called The Mayflower

(beat)
It’s perfection in antique form

DAVID
Uh yeah Well I should go

He starts to slink off but Sebastian stops him

SEBASTIAN

David I want you to have it
DAVID

What
SEBASTIAN

I mean it Consider it a gift
For the work you’ve done on the
hospital and what you’re doing on
the concert hall Please Take
it It would mean a lot to me

David stands there at an utter loss Amanda keeps quiet

EXT ROSE BOWL PARKING LOT - LATER

David and Pumpang are using ropes to tie the trunk down over
David’s new seventeenth century chest

DAVID
It’s like it’s not even a fair
fight

PUMPANG

He is a very worthy adversary So
generous so thoughtful

(beat)
Old dead William Brewster would
have been proud to know him
DAVID
Not helping Pumpang Just spying
on her isn’t doing anything but
proving what a great guy Sebastian
is I’ve got to do something else

Pumpang finishes his knot

PUMPANG
You could do as Sebastian does

DAVID
Meaning what

PUMPANG

Give her a gift My grandmother
was partial to milk sweets and
tulips I remember my grandfather
would bring them to her after every
indiscretion

DAVID
This isn’t a High School prom
Candy and flowers won’t cut it

PUMPANG
For my mother’s 60th birthday I
gave her a book of coupons You
know “good for one free back rub”
that kind of stuff
(sigh hurt)
She never redeemed them

David thinks for a moment
DAVID
If it were something thoughtful
Something meaningful
He looks back at the flea market and SNAPS his fingers
DAVID (cont’d)
Sebastian may be perfect in every
way but there’s one thing I’ve got
that he’s lacking

PUMPANG
Desperation

David shakes his head his eyes narrowing

DAVID
History buddy History

INT DEARHEART SCHOOL - MORNING

The halls are empty as David quietly SNEAKS out of Amandas
deserted classroom As he turns the corner he finds himself
alone with an early student - DONNIE hanging his coat in his
locker and wearing purple CAMOUFLAGE PANTS

DAVID
You again huh Thanks for your
help with that letter by the way
Donnie just stares at him silent not picking up on the
sarcasm He is not very smart Unbeknownst to David stern
Miss Essex peeks her head out of her classroom
DAVID (cont’d)
I gave you that candy for a reason
you know
Donnie still says nothing David tousles Donnie’s hair
DAVID (cont’d)
Maybe you can make it up to me
later sound good
David smiles at the kid noticing the way he is dressed

DAVID (contd)
Sweet pants you got there

Miss Essex has heard enough She races toward David

STERN TEACHER
STOP RIGHT THERE PREDATOR

David spins around recognizing the stern old teacher

DAVID
No It’s ok I’m not-- ah shit

David sprints away running out a side door

INT DEARHEART SCHOOL - LATER
Amanda and a YOUNG TEACHER walk down the hallway with Donnie

TEACHER
Poor Donnie Who knows how close
he came to who knows what with that
P-E-D-O-P-H-I-L-E

Donnie looks up utterly lost and slightly traumatized
Amanda enters her classroom and stops dead in her tracks

All the KIDS are gathered around her desk like gawkers at a
crime scene As she makes her way over the kids part so she
can get to her desk and see for herself Finally she does

Sitting on her desk is a STUFFED RAT Not the teddy bear
kind either An actual rat which had been alive at some
point in time possibly wandering the city’s sewers but had
recently spent time in a taxidermist’s shop The rat is
standing on its hind legs looking hideous

AMANDA
Oh my God

INT DAVID’S OFFICE - DAY

David sits behind his desk looking proud Karen sits across
from him her mouth is agape

KAREN
You did what

DAVID
I left a rat on Amanda’s desk to
remind her of me

KAREN
That’s disgusting David

DAVID

No it’s not See our first
apartment no matter how clean we
kept it this rat kept getting into
our food Finally we decided if
you can’t beat ‘em join ‘em So
we started to feed it He was
actually a very sweet rat We
called him Weiner cause he kind of
looked like a big sausage He bit
me once but he was cool

Karen shakes her head amazed and disgusted

DAVID (contd)
Anyway that stuffed rat was just
what I needed It’s an antique
which Amanda loves and it’s a
memory between the two of us
Sebastian can’t take that away

Karen pulls up a chair sits down and stares across the desk
at David She looks very seriously concerned

KAREN
Listen to me What I’m about to
say I say because I like you very
much and hate to see you like this
(beat)
David you have to stop

DAVID
It’s okay You don’t understand

KAREN
Yes I do You have to trust me on
this I’m a girl I know these
things Listen to me she is over
you She has found somebody else
and it’s time you did too

DAVID
But I--

KAREN
No You’re a wonderful man but
your life is falling apart in front
of your eyes and you can’t even see
it You look like shit You
haven’t done actual work in weeks
And now you’re spending money on
dead rodents David I’m begging
you let her go If not for
yourself do it for me

A brief confused look crosses Davids face but before he
can pursue it Rich barges in and sternly points at Karen

RICH
You out

Karen quickly exits David is surprised by Rich’s demeanor

DAVID
Hey Rich What’s up

RICH
It’s Mr Boswell - we may get hand
jobs together but I’m your boss
and I’1l be treated with respect
Now I hope I don’t have to tell
you that your presentation to the
Opera Board is in one week

From the look on David’s face that’s news to him
DAVID

(lying)
Of course not I’mon it

RICH
I try to be nice and what thanks
do I get I get shit on

David starts to protest but Rich cuts him off with a glare

RICH (contd)

I waited all weekend I expected a
phone call Maybe a fax Anything
to let me know you were working on
it But I got a big pile of squat
This project Saunders you have
been AWOL Every time I check in
youre either out of the office or
you pussyfoot around and don’t show
me dick Well I’m tired of it

David has no response
RICH (contd)
I got a call from Sebastian Cole
He wants to see you ASAP Is
there anything I should know about
David shakes his head - he has no idea

DAVID
Not that I’m aware of

RICH
There better not be Here’s his
address Now get out of my sight

David takes the paper from Rich and slinks out

EXT GATED COMMUNITY - DAY

David pulls up to a gorgeous home in a very exclusive
community Several expensive cars sit in the circular
driveway

David gets out and walks up to the huge double doors He
presses the doorbell A speaker next to the door clicks

SEBASTIAN (0S)
Y-ello

DAVID
Uh yeah it’s David Saunders
You wanted to see me

SEBASTIAN (0S)
Come on in I’m in the study

A soothing BUZZ David shakes his head and goes inside

INT SEBASTIANS HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

He walks down an amazing hallway past incredible room after
incredible room It’s somewhere between MTV’s Cribs and a
MerchantIvory film Finally he reaches

INT SEBASTIANS HOUSE - STUDY - CONTINUOUS

David enters a well-appointed study Bookshelves line the
walls filled with thousands of books A gorgeous mahogany
desk sits unoccupied David looks confused

DAVID
Um hello

David is startled as a TANNING BED he didn’t even notice
opens and Sebastian steps out He is quite the specimen
David is distracted by the tightness of Sebastian’s Speedos -
and the size of what they contain The man is packing heat

SEBASTIAN
David Thanks for coming

DAVID
Sure You uh wanna put on some
clothes
(almost an aside)
Please

SEBASTIAN
Oh I’m fine thanks Listen I
hope you won’t find this an
imposition I know your time is
precious and you’ve been working so
hard on our little project but I
asked you here for reasons of a
personal nature It’s about
Amanda If you’re not comfortable
talking about her then I
completely understand

Well at least David’s no longer thinking about his unit

DAVID
No not at all Whatever

SEBASTIAN
Good Amanda and I have been
seeing each other for two very
wonderful months now And of
course she’s nothing short of
amazing We go out we stay in it
doesn’t matter - wherever we are
we generate sparks

(MORE)

SEBASTIAN (contd)
When we dance we dance like no
one’s watching When we hug it
just seems right

David is miserable but hoping for a silver lining somewhere

SEBASTIAN (contd)
But then I think of you two -
spending seven years together The
way I see it you probably know
Amanda better than anyone

David starts to brighten

DAVID
Yeah

SEBASTIAN
So I’m wondering you think shed
like a surprise proposal or would
she rather pick the ring herself

David’s heart has stopped beating He can barely speak

DAVID
What

SEBASTIAN
I know Bit of a shock huh It’s
just one of those things You get
this feeling and you know it’s
right It’s perfect It’s love
It’s perfect love

David may very well be experiencing a panic attack

SEBASTIAN (contd)

I was thinking about doing it this
Friday She’s got a talent show at
school that night and at the end
after all these kids that mean the
world to her have gone up and put
everything on the line I thought
I’d do the same Put it all on the
line Ask her to marry me right
there on stage What you think

DAVID
It’s um it’s perfect

Sebastian claps him on the back and walks him out

SEBASTIAN
Thanks buddy That means a lot
I feel so jazzed about this I
have to admit I’ve even been
fantasizing about the honeymoon

David looks like he’s been punched in the stomach and kicked
in the crotch at the same time Sebastian notices

SEBASTIAN (contd)
Not that part of course No I
meant the actual trip As I’ve
always said life is not about the
destination - it’s the journey
Did you know she’s never been on a
cruise before I was thinking that
might be perfect don’t you

Finally David musters the strength to speak

DAVID
I really need to go home

INT DAVID’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

David sits on his sad sheetless bed He looks devastated
He opens a SCRAPBOOK - the same one from the beginning - and
takes out a photo of Amanda and David kissing David holds
the photo to his mouth and tries to participate in the kiss

BEGIN MONTAGE - Boston’s classic power ballad “Amanda”
plays as we watch David being emotionally tortured

David walks down a busy street He passes a woman and
quickly turns - was that Amanda Then another woman passes -
she too looks like Amanda Soon the sidewalk is filled with
Amanda lookalikes - everywhere he turns a swarm of them

He looks at a BUS STOP BENCH It’s got an ad for a perfume -
Amanda is the model The BUS arrives The ad on its side is
for a CAR ACCIDENT LAWYER with Amanda holding up a gavel and
a fistful of money Everywhere he turns is Amanda

David is at a PARK sitting on a bench He spots a TEA CUP
POODLE humping the shit out of a CHIHUAHUA He happens to
notice their large DOGTAGS - one is named “Sebastian” the
one underneath getting humped is named “Amanda” Weird

David sits in a BAR drowning his sorrows He looks down the
bar Sitting alone is Amanda He musters a weak wave She
returns the wave smiling Encouraged David stands and goes
to her He looks at her beautiful face holds it in his
hands kisses it long and hard It’s only as the BARTENDER
and a few PATRONS laugh and point that David realizes
something is wrong He pulls away - he was not making out
with Amanda He was tongue-kissing an ELDERLY FEMALE BARFLY
David runs out of the bar most likely to puke

David sits in his beanbag a pair of scissors in his hand and
a LIFE VEST around his shoulders He softly weeps as he cuts
something we cannot see

END MONTAGE

INT DAVID’S OFFICE - DAY

Karen enters David sits at his desk staring straight
ahead a far off hollow look in his eyes He doesn’t notice
Karen She angrily SLAMS a stack of papers on his desk

KAREN
Pathetic Are you even ready for
the presentation It’s in an hour

David looks her dead in the eyes He blinks

DAVID
He’s marrying her He told me

She looks like she might be having an aneurysm

KAREN
Good Maybe now you’1l get it
(pounding the desk)
It’s over You and Amanda are
done okay

David looks dazed stunned He cannot or will not respond

KAREN (contd)
There is no final scene where you
go running through the airport and
catch her at the gate just in time
Darryl Hannah is not going to leave
her life in the ocean for you and
there is no way in hell she’s going
to dump the hunky fireman for a guy
with a big nose just because he’s
best friends with Shelly Duvall

David opens his mouth but she shuts him down

KAREN (cont’d)

David you’re deluded You can’t
just make some ridiculous grand
gesture and have her suddenly see
the error of her ways Go ahead
take a limo climb her fire escape
and give her flowers But I got
news for you - you’re no Richard
Gere Amanda’s no hooker with a
heart of gold and I’m no fucking
Hector Elizondo All those stupid
movies don’t mean a thing in the
real world Do you understand

She breathes desperately into his face David smiles

DAVID
Thank you Karen you just helped
me more than you know

He gets up from his desk and starts to leave

KAREN
Where are you going

DAVID
To win back the love of my life

Karen buries her head in her hands David nearly runs head
in to Rich as he exits He doesn’t even stop

DAVID (cont’d)
I can’t make it The plans are on
a disk on my desk Wish me luck

For the first time since we’ve met him Rich is speechless

EXT PUMPANG’S DORM - DAY

David screeches up to Pumpang’s dorm He honks the horn and
Pumpang comes running out with several duffel bags

PUMPANG
You ready for this my friend

DAVID
Absolutely Where are we going

PUMPANG
The art museum It’s a field trip
Those are some very lucky
underprivileged children I know
the way - I’1l1 drive

Pumpang jumps in the driver’s seat

EXT STREETS - LATER

Pumpang drives like a madman darting through traffic making
hairpin turns hauling ass like he’s in Days of Thunder
David changes clothes in the back seat but it’s not easy

DAVID
Take it easy Pumpang We want to
get there alive

PUMPANG
The streets of Calcutta steel your
nerves and harden your soul
There it’s kill or be killed

More kick-ass stunt-driver-worthy moves as they drive on

INT LACMA ART MUSEUM - DAY
Amanda leads her class through the museum

AMANDA
Did everybody have a good time

The Kids all respond in unison with an excited “YES”
AMANDA (contd)
Well we better get back on the bus
We don’t want to be late for the
big talent show tonight do we

She rounds up the kids

AMANDA (contd)
This way everybody Donnie stay
with the group now

Donnie is lagging back mesmerized by a bright painting

DAVID (0S)
Listen to your teacher Donnie

Donnie looks up to see David standing above him He is
wearing a rented tux Donnie instantly runs off to the bus

Amanda doesn’t notice until she hears “Red Red Wine” playing
from a small CD boom box David holds over his head He moves
toward her but jerks to a stop having run out of cord He
sets the boom box down Pumpang steps out with a SITAR and
begins playing along softly with the CD adding a distinct
Hindu vibe David smiles

DAVID (contd)
I don’t want to keep you Amanda
I know you have to get on that bus
out there and go back to work But
I just need a moment of your time
before it’s too late

Amanda can only stare at the scene unfolding before her

DAVID (contd)
You see I’ve already waited too
long Seven years too long
Amanda I know it’s my fault I
got so caught up in work and
everything else that I took you for
granted There’s not a day goes by
that I don’t regret doing that

Everyone - Amanda the kids MUSEUM SECURITY - is listening

DAVID (cont’d)
But I’ve changed Right now I’m
missing the most important meeting
of my life because in the end
work’s not what’s important to me
You are

Is he getting through to her David can’t tell but he
continues anyway

DAVID (cont’d)
You said everything has a history
Some unique story of where it’s
been and how it came to be here
You and I have a history Amanda
Well I don’t know where I was
before I met you and I don’t want
to know where I’d be without you

David takes a knee He reaches into his pocket
DAVID (contd)
You said when you find something
you like you can become a part of
its story
He pulls out the CERAMIC CHICKEN from before

DAVID (contd)
Like a chicken

He opens its beak - dangling inside is a a smallish multi-
color gaudily bejeweled ring

Or a ring

David takes it out and holds it up to her

DAVID (contd)
This particular ring comes from
this older woman who lives in
Monrovia with a dozen cats She
never married but she was engaged
to a young sailor who ended up
being killed During the Bataan
Death March Apparently it was
pretty bad Anyway this is the
ring he gave her He loved her
very much I know it’s not some
pilgrim’s suitcase but I think
it’s a pretty good story anyway
And I would be honored if you’d
carry on the story of this ring -
with me

(MORE)

DAVID (contd)
(beat choking up)
What do you say Amanda Marry me

She wipes the tears from her eyes and looks down at David

AMANDA
I’m sorry David I’m in love with
Sebastian

She quickly makes her way through the kids and out The kids
look at David down on a knee destroyed And they start to
LAUGH and POINT Humiliation on top of heartbreak Great

INT PRISM ARCHITECTURE OFFICES - CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON

The atmosphere is just as awkward only there is no laughter
An entire boardroom including Sebastian sits in silence

RICH
Well uh unfortunately David
Saunders was unable to join us
today but fear not I do have his
designs so with no further ado
I give you the Long Beach Concert
Hall Karen

Karen at a laptop hits a button A huge FLATSCREEN MONITOR
illuminates The VERY ROUGH sketch of a building of some
sort appears The iconic music from the beginning of “2001”
plays As it does the sketch of the building MORPHS into a
sketch of a woman When it hits its crescendo the woman’s
features fill in and we see it’s Amanda

Then Grand Funk Railroad’s “Some Kind of Wonderful” plays
Only it’s not Grand Funk - it’s a cover By UB40

And so begins a slide show not of architectural designs but
of memories - of David and Amanda complete with fancy
(albeit amateurish) wipes They sure look happy

Rich does not though Neither does Sebastian

RICH (contd)
(quietly to himself)
Oh he’s gonna bleed

INT DAVID’S CAR - AFTERNOON

David and Pumpang arrive on campus Without a word Pumpang
hugs David then gets out and drags his sitar up to his dorm

David sits there in a daze looking crushed He watches all
the young love around him COUPLE after COUPLE walking to
class playing in the quad just hanging out - and it only
makes him feel worse

He spots an ASIAN COUPLE on a blanket in the grass The GIRL
is straddling the BOY who lies on his stomach She gives
him a loving massage David hears a voice from his past

MIN SOO (VO)
Love like a massage Push too
hard hurt bad

David blinks the victim of a moment of clarity

DAVID
I pushed too hard

He turns the ignition and begins to drive off

INT DAVID’S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - EVENING
Amanda looking hesitant and Pumpang stand at Davids door

PUMPANG
As long as I have known you I have
never asked for a favor I will
never ask you anything again okay

AMANDA
Pumpang you picked a strange time
to ask for a favor I really
shouldn’t be doing this

Pumpang lowers his head

PUMPANG
I am sorry for any awkwardness I
caused at the museum But you both
mean so much to me I would do
anything for you or David So lI
ask you please just see him this
one time Talk to him Please

Amanda sighs giving in Pumpang KNOCKS on David’s door No
response He knocks again Nothing

PUMPANG (cont’d)
David Open up

AMANDA
I don’t think he’s here Pumpang

Pumpang pulls out his high-tech lock picking set

INT DAVID’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

They enter Davids depressing apartment

AMANDA
God this place is depressing

PUMPANG
Yes his life is all but destroyed
without you in it
(calls out)
David I have someone to see you

AMANDA
Do you think he’s alright

She does seem somewhat concerned

PUMPANG
Well you did crush his spirit this
afternoon He’s probably just
sleeping it off

Pumpang rushes to the bedroom door and opens it His jaw
nearly drops to the floor - covering the entire wall of the
bedroom is a GIANT COLLAGE OF AMANDA David must have spent
hours cutting out photos of Amanda and pasting them to the
wall It is amazing it is beautiful it is fucking crazy

Pumpang slams the door shut hoping Amanda didn’t see
PUMPANG (cont’d)

You’re right He’s not home
Maybe some other time

AMANDA
I have to go The kids are waiting
for me
(beat)

You want to come
Pumpang looks up at her He nods

PUMPANG
Yes Of course I will be there

Pumpang shuts the door behind them

INT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

Amanda stands backstage She peeks out into the audience
where PARENTS take their seats and several UNIFORMED COPS
stand in the aisles She turns to MISS ESSEX

AMANDA
What’s with the SWAT team

MISS ESSEX
It’s a talent show There’s a
child molester on the loose
Amanda We might as well be
running a butcher shop here

Amanda sighs she has other things to worry about

AMANDA
Why would anyone stalk Donnie
anyway

She shakes her head confused

INT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - LATER

The place is packed Pumpang sits in the front row Amanda
stands at the side of the stage (out of sight from most of
the crowd) watching the chubby girl with skinned knees
butcher an (already butchered) Ashlee Simpson song smiling

From the side of the auditorium a broken looking man enters
It is David He looks around trying to spot Amanda Then
he does standing backstage with her clipboard He smiles
sadly and without causing a scene sets off to find her

INT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

unlocked door opens it and enters

INT DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

face paint He’s a MIME But he breaks the mime code

DONNIE
(BLOODCURDLING SCREAM)

DAVID
Oh shit What’s wrong with you

DONNIE
Ms Essex told me if I ever see a
stranger I should scream

DAVID
I’m not a stranger Donnie I
thought we were buddies

Donnie SCREAMS again Just then a UNIFORMED COP bursts in
aiming his gun at David

COP
Freeze

The boys react as if it’s the first time they’ve ever seen a
cop about to kill a man

BOYS
(BLOODCURDLING SCREAMS)

David ducks racing out of a back door

Out on stage Pumpang and the rest of the audience watch
David run by followed by the police

PUMPANG
David

David sprints off stage and down the hall running through
the bowels of the auditorium past Amanda

DAVID
I’m sorry

and finally through an exit into the night

EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET - CONTINUOUS

stare at an apartment building Amanda’s apartment building
Then he is captured

INT POLICE CAR - LATER

David stares longingly at all he’s lost

EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET - CONTINUOUS

As the squad car drives off Pumpang puts a comforting arm
around Amanda She is shaken by what’s become of David

Pumpang considers the question for beat A long beat

PUMPANG
I think it was love
INT JAIL - CELL - DAY

partition On the other side is Karen looking concerned

KAREN
How you holding up

DAVID
Well I’m in jail accused of being
a pedophile andor sexual predator
Other than that I’m fine

KAREN
You forgot to mention being fired

David nods his head He saw that one coming

KAREN (cont’d)
David I hate to see you like this

DAVID
You and me both But you’1ll be
happy to know I’ve done a lot of
thinking and I think you were
right I was out of control

KAREN
I know

DAVID
I let my feelings for Amanda
overwhelm my life

KAREN
I know

DAVID
Not anymore I’m a changed man

Karen smiles Finally he’s talking sensibly

DAVID (contd)
It’s over Karen I’ve given up
The only woman I ever loved
probably the only woman I ever will
love is gone and I’ve just got to
come to terms with that

When he puts it like that Karen is no longer smiling

DAVID (contd)
The irony is that’s what I was
going to tell her last night I
wanted to apologize and tell her I
was finally moving on I never had
a chance to though what with
being arrested and all

David sighs Karen doesn’t know whether to smile or not

DAVID (contd)
Karen I’m sorry for putting you
through all this You were amazing
to stand by me for so long I know
you were trying to talk some sense
into me even if I didn’t listen
That was really sweet Thank you

Karen smiles

KAREN
It’s okay Before you went all
crazy you were the best boss I
ever worked for All things being
equal I always thought you could
have done better than her anyway
Youre a great guy you could have
had anyone David Anyone

David is not sure how to take this

DAVID
Uh thanks Karen

KAREN
I know you’re not real good at
reading between the lines so I’1l
spell it out I love you David

Who thought it could get more uncomfortable being in jail

KAREN (cont’d)
With all my heart We’re meant to
be together Just like in those
romantic comedies

PUMPANG (contd)
Philharmonic to perform during the
wedding then Counting Crowes for
the reception Wolfgang Puck
himself is catering

STU
Sounds intense

David nods It is pretty damn impressive

PUMPANG

It is quite impressive I believe
Sebastian has thought of everything
to make this the perfect wedding
Of course that is his way He
expects perfection because he
defines perfection

(beat)
Well I should go Sebastian has
everything worked out precisely A
limo should be arriving any moment

At that very moment the limo HONK is heard

DAVID
See you later buddy

Pumpang exits

STU
These are some kick ass fish tacos
bro Where’d you get ‘em

JEFF
El Compadre dude They’re the
best There’s some flan too

David looks up at the mention of the restaurant

FLASH - David and Amanda sit in El Compadre sharing a booth
feeding each other tacos so crazy in love

BACK TO REALITY - David looks a bit dazed but goes back to
his book Jeff and Stu continue playing and eating

JEFF (contd)
That Sebastian dude sounds like a
tool to me

STU

Hell yeah A limo Wolfgang Puck
Counting Crowes Tool tool
double tool

DAVID
Well he’s not really a bad guy

JEFF
You ask me he’s got an unhealth
fixation on perfection Borderline
obsession sounds like

STU
Totally

David looks up from his book - their words have somehow
gotten through to him

FLASH - Sebastian at their first meeting at Davids office
SEBASTIAN
I can describe what we want ina
concert hall with one word
Perfection
FLASH - Sebastian standing by the antique chest

SEBASTIAN (contd)
It’s perfection in antique form

FLASH - Sebastian in his study after he told David of his
plan to propose

Amanda is having the final touches applied She is in her
wedding gown and she looks more spectacular than the view

DAVID (0S)
You look absolutely stunning

Amanda and her bridesmaids (including Cindy) turn to see
David standing in the doorway looking out of breath

AMANDA
David what are you doing here

DAVID
It’s called a Hail Mary

Cindy looks like she’s about to puke

CINDY
Oh my God You can’t even be
serious I’m getting security
And Sebastian

DAVID
Then I better hurry Amanda you
have found yourself the perfect
man and I congratulate you for
that But here is my point and
the reason I came here today you
don’t need the perfect man

He pauses to let the words soak in

DAVID (contd)

You don’t want a perfect man
That’s why you went out with me in
the first place Why you teach
troubled orphans Why you have
soft spots for rodents and
estranged Hindus

More people gather as Cindy searches desperately for
security

DAVID (contd)
Perfection is overrated Sebastian
isn’t the one for you Every fight
you’re gonna have - you’re gonna be
wrong Every day that doesn’t go
well every choice that doesn’t
work out - it’s going to be your
fault Not his The fact is
perfection is not human As great
as he is he’s not human and you
know it You need a human Amanda
And being human means having flaws

He pauses shaking his head building his case

DAVID (contd)
And I’m all about the flaws I’m
not perfect I’m not great Far
from it In fact not only am I
not great I’m pretty mediocre

That’s a unique sales pitch

DAVID (cont’d)
But I am working on it And I’m
already a hell of a lot better than
I was a year ago when I made the
biggest mistake of my life You
made me better - and that was when
we were broken up Just imagine
how much I’1l improve if we’re
together

David takes a breath trying to collect himself

DAVID (cont’d)
I’m not perfect But I think I’m
perfect for you I know you I
know your strengths and I know your
imperfections I know you smile
while you sleep I know you like
your tea served with an ice cube on
the side just in case it’s too
hot And I know that you have the
most beautiful caring heart of
anyone I’ve ever met

Amanda is not stopping him
DAVID (contd)
You aren’t perfect but you’re as
close as I ever want to come And
you being so close to perfect and
my being so far from perfect I
think together we’d be just right
Just then a few SECURITY GUARDS and Sebastian arrive

SEBASTIAN
Honey is everything alright

David - and everyone else in the room - looks at Amanda

his wedding but to take his
honeymoon as well

close
