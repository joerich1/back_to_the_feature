OVER BLACK

NICK (VO)
It’s the middle of the night And
the day begins

The SOUND of a SLAPPING BASS kicks in

INT ONE-ROOM CLUB -- NIGHT

A HARDCORE BAND is playing for a flailing crowd of followers
BUT ALL WE HEAR IS BASS Heavy bass

NICK (V0O)
There is nothing but this bass in
my hands Nothing but this noise
in my ears I am clockwork

We are on-stage with NICK (18 bass God) He wears a black t-
shirt that reads I think about death A lot

NICK (V0)
I am the ticking the pulsing the
generator I am the one who takes
this thing called music and lines
it up with this thing called time

WE HEAR THE MUSIC NOW -- the wailing guitar the screaming
lyrics But still something is missing

NICK (VO)
Okay so we dont have a drummer
But I am underneath every part of
this I am puncturing I am
punctuating Whatever happens
its on my cue

He looks over at DEV (20 singerscreamer)

NICK (V0)
In one measure Dev’ll rip off his
shirt and throw it to the crowd

Dev then rips off his shirt and throws it to the crowd The
crowd screams at the shirtless Dev

NICK (V0O)
I mean look at these people Look
at these people looking at us

We now see who caught Devs shirt -- TWO GAY MEN tugging at
the sweaty threads In fact MEN ARE EVERYWHERE
NICK (V0)
Okay so Im a non-queer bassist in
a queer-core band

DEV (SING-SCREAMING)
Fuck the Man Fuck the Man I
really want to Fuck the Man

NICK (VO)
But who is filling the room
with undertone Who is drenching
them in soundwaves Who is bigger
than the box I’m in and What The
Fuck Is She Doing Here

The sea of men is parted by TRIS (18 annoyingly pretty)

NICK (V0O)
Dear God I told her not to come

Nicks bass slips throwing the rhythm Dev looks at him
NICK (V0O)

While she was ripping me to pieces
that was the one fragment I begged

to keep Please dont come to the
shows I said I dont want to
see you there Of course she

lied Is nothing sacred
Then Nick sees she is arm-in-arm with ANOTHER GUY NICK (VO)
Apparently not

Nicks fingers react angrily speeding up the rhythm Dev
takes his cue singing faster and faster

NICK (V0O)
Do not bounce your head to this
Tris This music is not for you

The GUY WITH TRIS starts head-banging too into the music

NICK (V0O)
And its definitely not for that
hand-job you’ve replaced me with
(then calming)
Okay Its gonna be okay The set
is over in six five four three -

DEV (SINGING)
Take the Power Fuck the Man
NICK (V0O LOSING IT)
No please Dev dont take this
song into a fourth minute I cant
handle a fourth minute

Nick turns to the guitarist THOM NICK (VO LOOKING)
And now Thoms thinking about a
solo thats not good for anybody
Please please lets just finish
this thing so I can go bleed to
death in peace

DEV (SINGING)
Fuck that Man

With one final scream the song is over Nicks bass lets
out one last screwball chord And the crowd erupts

DEV (INTO THE MIC)
We are The Fuck-Offs

With that Dev jumps into the audience to make out with the
most willing guy Thom disperses too leaving Nick on-stage
gripping his bass a deer in headlights The NEXT BAND steps
up setting up around him But Nick is motionless

NICK (OUT LOUD)
Three weeks two days and twenty-
three hours ago and shes already
with someone else

NEXT BAND’S DRUMMER
What

The NEXT BAND’s DRUMMER looks at him
NICK (VO)
This is the soundtrack to our
failed relationship The break-up

mix I never gave you Track one

Nick stumbles off-stage avoiding Tris contact

INT ONE-ROOM CLUB -- MOMENTS BEFORE

In the middle of the room Tris parts the sea of men
bouncing her head to the music self-aware
NORAH (VO)
This should be a story about Tris
Annoyingly pretty Tris with the
dirty blond hair handful of tits
and tight-ass skirts

We move from Tris through the throng of dancing kids until
we land on NORAH arms folded and in control

NORAH (VO)
It should be But it isnt

DEV (INTO THE MIC)
We are The Fuck-Offs

The band has finished Norah is focused on Nick now
standing small and alone on-stage ‘til her drunken friend
CAROLINE (18 buxom) steps in her line of vision

CAROLINE
Fuck on Look at you lookie-lou
bumping her)
Go talk to him

NORAH (SCOFFS)
Yeah that’s likely
(making excuse)
Besides he’s a total mo

CAROLINE
He’s no mo Look at how badly he’s
dressed Look at his shirt and his
Supercuts hair and he’s coming over
here

Caroline gives Norah a slight nudge and Nick bumps into
Norahs shoulder as he passes her by without seeing her

NORAH (RECOVERING)
Well hes bridge-and-tunnel
whatever he is

CAROLINE (SLURRING)
Oh yeah And what are we

NORAH (BACK AT CAROLINE)
We arent anything You however
are trashed C’mon lets go

CAROLINE (SCOFFS)
Whatever Mom Cut the cord

Caroline storms away Norah watches her sidle up to a group
of ogling men and proceed to flirt wildly

NORAH (V0O)
I pretend it’s not gonna be the
same thing every time But I can
already see how this night’1ll go
down

WE ALSO SEE HOW THIS NIGHT’LL GO DOWN

NORAH (V0O)
Iil load her onto the vomit comet--

Norah lifts her vodka-soaked friend up the bus steps

NORAH (VO)
Ill hold her hair when she pukes -

Norah acts as scrunchy as Caroline hurls into a garbage can

NORAH (V0)
Ill make up the extra bed --

Norah pulls out the trundle bed

NORAH (VO)
And in the morning --

Norah sits at the TABLE Caroline shuffles in the room

NORAH (VO)
-- when she stumbles into the
kitchen all disheveled and stiil
drunk my parents will look at her
like the daughter they never had

Norahs MOTHER (40s) holds out a plate of pancakes her
FATHER (50s) extends an extra Bloody Mary sipping from his
own On Norah’s annoyed face

WE CUT BACK TO THE CLUB She wears the same annoyed face
until a CUTE BANDBOY taps her on the shoulder

NORAH (VO PERKING UP)
Or maybe --

She perks up giving a wry smile Until the boy reaches into
his pocket and pulls out a CD

CUTE BANDBOY
Its just a demo but I thought --
“He slips the CD into her hand followed by a shitty wink
She looks down at the disc labeled CARBON 9

NORAH
Yeah Awesome

He walks away She tosses the CD to the floor When she
turns back Nick is standing next to her talking to Thom

RANDY (0S)
What are we looking at

RANDY (20s lanky rocker) leans over her shoulder

NORAH (WORKING UP THE COURAGE)
Somebodys gotta get Caroline home

RANDY (JUMPING)
Ill do it

He rushes off

NORAH (SHOUTING AFTER HIM)
I said somebody Randy Not
anybody

Randy shoves his way through the group of men around
Caroline Norah watches as he lifts her onto an amplifier
she stands over the crowd and shouts out

CAROLINE (SHOUTING)
When I say Jesus -- you say Christ
Jesus --

CROWD (ANSWERING)

-- Christ

CAROLINE (SHOUTING)
Jesus --

CROWD (ANSWERING)
-- Christ

Everyone howls Norah tries not to smile shakes her head

NORAH (VO)
It’s the middle of the night And
my day begins
INT ONE-ROOM CLUB -- MOMENTS BEFORE

Nick weaves through the crowd like a lost puppy getting
slammed from all sides by the between-set mass the bright
red exit light beckons like an oasis in the desert

NICK (V0O)
My eyes are still used to searching
for her in a crowd My body is
used to moving with hers So the
distance -- anything short of
contact -

He bumps into Norah without noticing

NICK
-- igs a constant rejection

Thom steps in front of him drops an amplifier in his arms

NICK
No Thom I can’t

THOM
You said you’d be equipment bitch
so we could play manhunt

NICK (STOPPING HIM DEAD SERIOUS)
You don’t understand Shes here

Thom joins the crowds chant

THOM

CAROLINE (0S)

Thom laughs and claps But Nick cant preoccupied with the
image of Tris only a few yards away from him

NICK
Shes so hot it kills me

THOM (RE CAROLINE)
Shes wasted

NICK
I mean Tris Are you listening I
need to get outta here

THOM
But Monomania is up next

NICK
Yes and Tris likes this band And
the fact that I know that crushes
me because all this knowledge of
what she likes and doesnt like is
perfectly useless to me now

THOM
Well so is bitching about her but
you keep on keeping on

Nick hands the amp to Thom
NICK
I want to leave

Thom hands the amp to some BEEFY GUY (20s) standing behind
him Thom looks him up and down Then turns back to Nick

THOM
Look at her Nick shes a mall
hussy She woke up went to Urban
Outfitters got a Ramones t-shirt
and dumped your straight ass a
month ago Ive said it before and
Tll say it again Fuck her

Thom turns back to the Beefy Guy introduces himself

THOM
Hi I’m Thom

Nick looks back to Tris

NICK (V0O)
Its not Thoms fault He doesnt
know what its like to live with
the memories See I remember
taking that shirt off of her I
remember removing those stockings
that make her look like a comic
book hero

Nick closes his eyes

INT TRISS BEDROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

NICK (V0
Im remembering that right now

It is quiet No club noise Nick is removing Triss clothes
like he cant believe he gets to do this He slides the
yellow stockings past her thighs

TRIS (GENTLY)
Careful careful

He gets them past her knees and slips them off her feet
NICK (V0O)
I get to remember this whenever I

want to

He sits back almost catching his breath

NICK (V0O)
Problem I cant fucking forget it

INT ONE-ROOM CLUB -- NIGHT (PRESENT)

The music is pumping Nick opens his eyes to see the pair of
them swaying to the beat his hands on her Ramones shirt

NICK (V0O)
And now this guy is running his
hands all over Joeys face
Rolling down Dees chin and --
(out loud)
Oh God she’s coming over here

Suddenly Tris and her dude are walking directly towards Nick
Nick turns to Thom searching for help but he is making out
with the Beefy Guy Nick turns to his other side where
Norah is standing staring in the same direction

NORAH (V0)
Shes seriously coming over here

Norah looks past Tris to see Caroline currently tongue-deep
in that guy Randy

NORAH (V0O)
You see there’s Caroline

A distant FLUSH takes us to

INT SACRED HEART BATHROOM -- DAY (FLASHBACK)

Caroline emerges from the stall pulling up her Catholic
schoolgirl skirt a cigarette dangling from her mouth

CAROLINE
Ive decided to fuck Randy from Are
You Randy

NORAH (VO)

Norah dressed the same but buttoned up throws water in her
hands and slicks back her hair

NORAH
You are a penis fly trap
(then V0O)
And then there’s Tris
ii

r Tris also in uniform her skirt rolled two inches shorter
is trying to smoke a cigarette

TRIS
Theyre not too terrible

Norah watches Tris pull her ponytail through a mesh John
Deere hat

NORAH (V0O)
That trucker hat shes sporting
since Ashton Kutcher made it trés
uncool should be proof enough of
her poser status

TRIS
I think Im gonna pierce my
eyebrow

CAROLINE (DEADPAN)
Gross

TRIS
Well something then

Norah looks at Tris looking at Caroline

NORAH (VO)

But the way she rifles through
Carolines dirty laundry from
clothes to ex-boyfriends is what
makes her Single White Female

CAROLINE
Piercing is out Tris We should
be happy with the holes God gave
us

Norah laughs

TRIS (TO NORAH)
Youve never even pierced your
ears

NORAH
Im Jewish

TRIS
So You go to Catholic school just
cause we do
NORAH

How bout you pierce your knees

Caroline laughs

TRIS

Tris reaches into her bag

scans the tape’s playlist

NORAH (IMPRESSED)

TRIS
Wait’ll you hear the song he wrote
at the end

Norah slides the tape in her pocket

The words

CAROLINE

mystery boy so we can judge him for
ourselves

TRIS (MEANING NORAH)
Well I didnt want him getting too
close to the ice box We all know
Norah’s affect on guys

CAROLINE (BEING FUNNY)
Nah youre just scared well tell
him what a whore you are

NORAH (NOT BEING FUNNY)
No shes scared hell fall in love

Norah

Theres an awkward moment between the three of them The
truth hits Tris Her jaw drops

NORAH (V0O)
And then we wrote our phony little
have a great summers in our
Sacred Heart yearbooks and I hoped
I’d never see her again

INT ONE-ROOM CLUB -- MOMENTS BEFORE

NORAH (V0)
But here she is

Same moment as before Tris walking over to the corner bar
but this time from Norahs perspective SLOW-MOTION

NORAH (VO)
Why does she insist on wearing
those awful yellow stockings that
make her look like a comic book
villain And that dude shes with
isnt he one of Carolines rejects
Caroline I gotta find Caroline

She turns to see Caroline making out with Randy

NORAH (VO)
Shit why am I always the only one
by myself

Norah looks to her right At Nick That other guitarist and
some beefy guy are locked at the lips Norah looks back at
Tris as she whispers something in her new guy’s ear

NORAH (VO)
Ice Box Just cause I’m not a
total slut I’m a fucking ice box

Suddenly Nick steps in front of Norah

NICK
Hi Hello

NORAH
Oh God please don’t hand me a CD

NICK (CONFUSED)
What

Tris is closer now Almost there Norah grabs Nicks face
and pulls it towards hers Their lips just barely land on
each other The kiss is awkward teenage

Nick’s eyes are open the whole time And out of the
periphery he sees Tris inching closer

Nick ‘spins Norah’s body around making sure that Tris is
watching and goes in again

This time the kiss is better Their mouths intertwined
getting lost in it for a moment until

TRIS (0S)
Nick Norah

They pull away Norah especially bleary-eyed They look up
at Tris her mouth agape standing with her new dude

TRIS

How do you guys like know each
other

Theres a moment of silence They all stand speechless
staring Nick opens his mouth to answer when the NEXT BANDS
MUSIC KICKS IN LOUD AND OVERPOWERING drowning out Nicks

words Tris’s new dude takes her by the hand leading her
back towards the pit

Theres a sudden break in the music just long enough to hear

NICK
And you look great by the way

But Tris is already gone Norahs eyes fill with panic

NORAH
Oh dear God

NICK
How do you know Tris

She swallows

NORAH
Tell me youre not Nick

NICK (SUDDENLY HOPEFUL)
She’s told you about me

Norah starts backing away bee-lining towards Caroline

NORAH
I I gotta find my friend

NICK
Tris

NORAH
No

NICK
Shes not your friend

NORAH
No I mean yeah I mean there’s
other forces at work here Nick

CLOSE on Tris watching Nick weave through the crowd trailing
Norah

Norah squeezes through the dancing kids up to her wasted
friend and pries her from Randy’s mouth

NORAH (CODE)
Red Rooster Red Rooster I just
kissed Triss sloppy seconds

CAROLINE (ANNOYED)
What’s the problem now

NORAH (EQUALLY ANNOYED)
The problem Caroline is that this
(gesturing to herself)
is not gonna compete with that --
(gesturing to Tris)
The night is over Red --

Norah pulls Caroline slips and falls to the floor

NORAH
-- Rooster

Norah ducks down trying to lift her inebriated friend to her
feet And just as quickly Nick is there

NICK
Seriously how do you know Are
you leaving

NORAH
I have to get my friend home

NICK
You need a ride I could give you
a ride Back to Englewood Is
that where youre from Englewood

NORAH
Do I look like Im from Englewood

NICK
I dont Wait does that mean you
are from Englewood or you arent
Nick helps Caroline to her feet

CAROLINE (TO NICK)
That’s one Super-cut you got dude

And with that she slips again Nick recovers her lifting
her limp body in his arms

NICK (TO NORAH)
Im right out front

He carries Caroline towards the exit light Norah in tow He
sees Thom giving him a thumbs up and mouthing the word
“Nice” Nick stands up a little straighter
NICK
Don’t worry There’s plenty of
room in it for

TRIS (0S)
I need your car

Suddenly Tris is standing right in front of him Hes a deer
in headlights again holding Caroline

NICK (IN SHOCK
Hm What

We see it FROM NICK’S EYES FOR A MOMENT

TRIS
I said I want to get back together

He stares blankly at her until the fantasy is gone

TRIS
So can we have your keys or what

Nick blinks

NICK
We

Nick looks over at the other dude suddenly realizing that
“we” doesnt refer to him and Tris

NORAH
Car‘s already full Tris Sorry

TRIS
Uh I wasnt talking to you Norah
okay So why dont you take
Drunkzilla here back to your
daddy’s house and get on with your
nightly duties I’m talking to
Nick

NICK
Now when you say “we”

NORAH
You don’t understand Tris
Theres no room for you Not
tonight

Norah and Tris stare daggers at each other
TRIS
Whatever You can have him I
just wanted his car
And with that Tris flips her hair and walks away Nicks

heart stops he immediately releases his grip on Caroline
dropping her to the floor

EXT ONE-ROOM CLUB LOWER EAST SIDE -- LATER

The SOUND of an EXHAUSTED ENGINE Sputtering Spitting
Conking out Raging music pours out of the club’s front
doors but our heroes are stalled In Nicks YELLOW YUGO
INT NICKS YUGO - CONTINUOUS

Norah sits in the passenger seat watching Nick try the key
again and again It is uncomfortably silent until

NORAH
A Yugo Dont see that every day

She leans forward steel is coming through her seat fabric
NORAH
Certainly not in such mint

condition

She turns to him hoping hell smile But he is all about
the key She leans against the window exhales

NORAH
So this is how it ends The last
real night of summer I’m in the
city and instead of going out in
style Im sitting in a Yugo that
wreaks of Triss patchouli

BURP They turn to Caroline who we now see is folded in
Nicks cramped back-seat She blows the burp up front

NORAH
And Carolines dragon-breath

Caroline passes out

NICK
So this is your friend

NORAH
My charge more like it

NICK
I saw you two earlier

NORAH (PERKING UP)

Really
NICK

I thought maybe you were a couple
NORAH

A couple of what
NICK

A couple of lesbians

Norah lets out a laugh

NICK (FRUSTRATED)
Damn it why wont she turn

Norah stops laughing -- Does he mean the car or Tris Ina
moment of frustration Nick hits the steering wheel But the
horn catches gets stuck A steady booming HOOOOOOONK pours
out Just then a DRUNK KID yells at Nicks window

DRUNK KID
You off-duty

Nick waves him off shouting --

NICK (LIKE IT HAPPENS A LOT)
This is not a cab

The kid walks away Norah slams her fist on the wheel the
honking finally stops She looks at Nick hanging his head

NORAH (SHE AND CAROLINE)
Maybe we should just take the bus

Just then theres a KNOCK at Norahs window A PUNK KID motions to her She rolls it down

NORAH
Hey thanks guy we could really
use some

He hands her a CD

PUNK KID (NERDIER THAN HE LOOKS)
Were called Army of Infamy Kind
of a fusion of Atreyu and Hate
Breed with a little um
Radiohead

NORAH
Right

Norah rolls up the window Turns to Nick

NORAH
See this is the problem with
technology You give people iBooks
and Garage Band and now any idiot-
poser can cut a crap album

She throws the CD in the back-seat with Caroline Nick looks
at her What was that all about

NORAH (BITING HER LIP)
What

Just then a WHITE VAN barrels down the one-way street in
the wrong direction towards them Nick looks up

NICK
Oh thank God

When the van stops Thom and the Beefy Guy hop out

THOM
Ah the Cold War relic

BEEFY GUY
Having some trouble

NICK (GREETINGS)
Hey Thom Hey Beefy Guy

THOM
Pop the hood and lets jump this
bitch

Nick pops the hood Thom bends down to address Norah

THOM (TO NORAH)
Sweetheart Dev could use some
help in the van if you please

Norah shrugs and climbs out The Beefy Guy starts attaching
jumper cables to the engine Thom waits until Norahs out of
ear shot then leans in Nicks window

THOM
Shes cute In an Emily Dickinson
sort of way

NICK
Stop it

THOM
Did you see the manager nod to her
when you guys left

NICK
I was sort of preoccupied

BEEFY GUY (SHOUTING ER IMPRESSION)
CLEAR

Nick turns the key The engine grinds

INT THE VAN -- CONTINUOUS

Norah climbs into the passenger seat and looks up at the lead
singer Dev

DEV
Hi I’m Dev I‘ll be your
queerleader for this evening
She looks at him confused He hands her a FIFTY

NORAH
I don’t get it

DEV
Thom and I pooled our resources
Lets just say we’re not the
biggest fans of his dreaded ex
and weve decided youre to be
his salvation

NORAH
Ah Well Im all for salvation
but Im afraid I dont get paid

by the hour so

DEV
Look hes cool you seem cool
Tim not the biggest fan of that
flannel youre wearing but

He starts looking around the van for a different top holding
up a few choices He whistles for her to take off her shirt

DEV (MOTIONING)
C’mon were all girls here

BEEFY GUY (0S)
CLEAR
INT NICKS YUGO -- CONTINUOUS
Thom leans in Nick’s window as he grinds the engine again

THOM
So what they know each other

NICK
So I think this is my opportunity
You know To get some answers

THOM
Answers You got the answer Nick
The answer was ‘no’ The answer is

currently fucking your ex-
girlfriend Now it’s your
choice pity party for one Or
titty party for two

Nick rolis up the window not wanting to hear anymore

INT THE VAN -- CONTINUOUS

Dev squeezes Norah into a white wife-beater her body
surprisingly curvy underneath

DEV
Just take him for a drive Take
him to a show or a movie whatever
straight people do

NORAH
I think he needs to be alone for a
little while

DEV
He‘s been alone for a little while
Hes over all that He had a mild
case of Trisitis and now you’re
here to give him a Trisiotomy

Dev pinches her cheeks giving the illusion of blush

DEV
Besides we saw you two making out
and we think you’re the one

Norah smiles The first real smile we’ve seen from her
Suddenly the SOUND of the engine turning Norah looks up

INT NICKS YUGO -- CONTINUOUS

The car now rocking and rolling Nick grabs his lucky jacket
thrift store variety monogrammed Salvatore and steps out
to talk to Thom shutting the door

NICK
I just want to find out “why”

THOM
Good go ahead hang with flannel-
girl get some of those “answers”
youve been looking for

CLOSE on Caroline stirring in the back-seat with a “shhhhh”
and begin rolling up the Yugo windows locking the doors

THOM
And in the midst of the
interrogation quite possibly by
sheer accident just have a good
time you can do that can’t you

Nick shrugs and grabs for the door handle but IT’S
LOCKED With Caroline passed out inside His eyes widen

NORAH (0S)
I can’t

INT THE VAN -- CONTINUOUS

Norah hands Dev back the fifty pulling her flannel back over
the wife-beater

DEV
Why not

NORAH
Theres a drunk girl in the back of
that Yugo who needs to be vomiting
in a toilet in Englewood by
morning so

Dev looks up to see Nick now banging on his car screaming
through its window tugging on the handle Dev turns back to
Norah ties her flannel up above her belly button and shoves
the fifty in her cleavage

DEV
Well trade you

EXT ONE-ROOM CLUB -- LATER

EVERYONE
WAKE UP CAROLINE

Everyone and I mean EVERYONE from inside the club is now
surrounding Nicks Yugo a barrage of PUNK KIDS all shaking
the car banging on the steel really enjoying the chaos

NICK
Careful She’s in a weakened
condition

DEV (CALLING OUT)
Wait wait wait I think her eyes
are opening Shut up everybody

Dev leans against the window

DEV
Caroline Can you hear me

Carolines eyes roll around a little drool on her chin

DEV (SLOWLY)
Arent you pretty Okay Linda
Blair what Im gonna need you to
do is take two fingers move
‘em to the door

Norah cant take it anymore

NORAH (STEPPING IN)
Unlock the door bitch

DEV (TO NORAH)
Well I dont think that cussing
is Wait it worked Shes
moving everyone Shes moving

Everyone cheers again Carolines arm falls to her side
And very slowly she reaches out

DEV
There it is

The crowd is on their toes making anticipating noises

NICK
Get there Get there

Carolines hand slides up the passenger door To the lock
And CLICK The crowd goes wild The door opens and Caroline
falls out onto the pavement

But before Norah can do anything the crowd lifts Caroline
into the air passing her from person to person CROWD
SURFING her to the van The Beefy Guy gets hold of her legs

BEEFY GUY
I got her

While the Beefy Guy loads Caroline into the van Dev and Thom
shove Nick and Norah into opposite sides of the Yugo

DEV
Well get her home

THOM
The night is young

DEV
And so are you

They are shoved inside The doors shut The chaotic crowd
swarms the car shaking it violently like in a riot Nick
looks at Norah

NORAH
Go Go

The engine is revved The car’s in drive Nick steps on the
gas And the crowd helps shove Jessie forward giving them a
real send-off A real Bon Voyage into the night

As they pull away the kids shout their good-byes SOME even
chase after the car trying to hold on ONE KID rips off a
piece of dangling metal as Nick and Norah make their escape

INT NICKS YUGO -- CONTINUOUS

They can’t help but laugh as they watch the scene get smaller
and smaller behind them Until they hit the first red light
The car stops The laughter stops

They sit in silence Waiting for the light to turn green
Any minute now And green The car grinds forward again
they’re off After a moment

NORAH (0S)
Where are we going

INT NICKS YUGO -- MOMENTS LATER BUT IT FEELS LIKE FOREVER

Tumbleweed blows down the armrest between them It would be
deafeningly silent if not for the radio Finally

NORAH
So your friends um they’re
all gay right

NICK
Well not all my friends

NORAH
I mean the ones in the van

NICK

Oh yeah Yeah don’t worry

NORAH

NORAH
I don’t drink

NICK
Yeah me neither

She looks at him suddenly impressed

NORAH
Youre straight-edge

He shrugs cool
NICK (COOL)
I dont really subscribe to any
label

Norah rolls her eyes

NORAH (UNDER HER BREATH)
He says wearing Diesel jeans

NICK (NOT HEARING)

NORAH
Nothing

Nick turns up the radio They listen to the beat for a
moment Then

NORAH

Hey listen dyou hear that
NICK

NORAH

That strange banging noise

NICK
Oh God is it the car

NORAH (BEING FUNNY)
Its called drumming dude Its
like the underlying staple of sound
since primitive times Your band
needs a drummer And we needa
aaggat’s

She pops open the glove compartment A POLAROID of TRIS is
taped inside looking back at her Nick realizes it’s still
there Norah looks at it as the next song comes on

Pictures of You The Cure The silence has been replaced
with the lyric’s glaring irony

ROBERT SMITH (SINGING)
I’ve Been Looking So Long At These
Pictures Of You I Almost Believe
That They’re Real

NORAH
The Cure How could they call
themselves The Cure I mean what
the fuck are they the cure for

NICK
Yeah The Cause Thats what they

She slams the glove compartment shut They stop at a red
light And suddenly the back door opens Nick turns to see
TWO DRUNK TEENAGERS boy and girl climb in back

DRUNK GUY
Twenty-eighth and eighth

They shut the door and immediately begin making out
Heavily Nick looks back at them

NICK
This isn’t a

They keep sucking face thinking they’re in a cab Nick
turns back to Norah She shrugs He steps on the gas

NICK
Twenty-eighth and eighth
INT NICKS YUGO -- LATER

The sound of the hard-core tongue-bath behind them Nick and
Norah try to make conversation to drown it out

NICK
So are you from Englewood

NORAH
Uh-huh

Nick taps the steering wheel

NICK (TRYING TO BE FUNNY)
‘Englewood up to no good”
(then)
I’m from Hoboken by the way

NORAH

Nick gives a fraction of a smile

DRUNK GUY
I love you

DRUNK GIRL

DRUNK GUY

The drunk kids continue to paw at each other

NICK
You come into the city a lot

NORAH
On the weekends Whenever there’s
a show worth seeing

NICK
Its funny weve never met before

NORAH
Why is it funny

NICK
You know

The back-seat kissing has become moaning The noises are
louder and louder Nick talks louder to cover it

NICK
Are you going off to college

NORAH
Oh uh I don’t know yet

NICK
You don’t know where
NORAH
Um I don’t know if I mean

NICK

NORAH

He turns to her She bites her lip

NICK
How did you

DRUNK GUY (LOUD)
You passed it dude

Nick screeches the car to a halt A few yards past a clubs
velvet ropes and the long line of emopunks waiting out
front

DRUNK GUY
How much

NICK
Eight fifty

The kid throws a crumpled ten up front and hops out Norah
watches him walk his girl to the end of the club’s line
Nick looks at Norah trying to sound casual

NICK
So

Suddenly Nick’s voice comes through on the mix tape
NICKS VOICE (ON THE MIX TAPE)
So thats it Tris The break-up
mix Ten songs from my broken
heart to

Nick quickly ejects the tape A beat then

NORAH (NOT LOOKING AT HIM)
I gotta pee

She bursts from the car slamming the door shut behind her

NICK (TO SELF)
And there she goes

Nick watches Norah walk straight up to the velvet rope where
the BOUNCER immediately pulls it back letting her past
Nick cocks his head curious and then --

YELLOW STOCKINGS

Out of the corner of his eye Running along the opposite
sidewalk and disappearing around a corner Nick blinks
immediately throwing his car in drive Following

INT CLUB -- MOMENTS LATER

Norah squeezes through the crowd marching towards the
bathroom cell phone in hand -- DIALING CAROLINE We hear
the ringing and ringing --

NORAH
C’mon cmon

INT THE VAN -- SAME TIME

The muffled sound of a cell phone ringing Hava Nagila in
Caroline’s pocket She’s passed out in the van’s back
surrounded by band equipment while Thom Dev and the Beefy
Guy are squeezed up front mid-conversation

DEV
I just think The Fuck-Offs isn’t
hard-core enough

BEEFY GUY
How ‘bout The Fuck-Ons

DEV
Or The Fuckers

THOM
The Motherfuckers

DEV
The Fatherfuckers

The guys laugh The laughter creeps inside Carolines
sleeping head Her eyes slowly peel open She takes in her
surroundings White van Three strange men up front
including the tattooed arm of a rather beefy fellow

BEEFY GUY
What about the Cockmasters

Her eyes widen panicked

DEV (0S)
Balls Deep

The strange men laugh Caroline is terrified

THOM (0S)
Here it is End of the line

The van slows She lies perfectly still as it pulls over and
the “kidnappers” exit the van leaving Caroline alone

This is her window of opportunity She SHOVES OPEN the vans
back doors and makes her escape sprinting down the city
Sidewalk into night

INT CLUB’S BATHROOM STALL MOMENTS LATER

Norah hangs up and plops onto the toilet seat now face-to-
face with a huge strip of GRAFFITI She scans the walls

Reading different colored scrawlings like “Jimmy gives good
head” and “I don’t want the world I just want your half”

And then she sees a doodle of a WHITE RABBIT And another
white rabbit And another Norah follows the little white
rabbits all the way around to the bottom of the stalls wall
Norah bends down and underneath the stall next to her

GIRL
Perv

A GIRL zipping up her jeans gives her a look as Norah
arrives at the final white rabbit with a little thought
bubble saying FIND WHERE’S FLUFFY AT THE RED ROOM TONIGHT
Norah’s eyes light up She rubs the ink The color bleeds
on her finger She gasps

INT NICKS YUGO -- SAME TIME

Nick drives turning a corner in search for the yellow
stockings he’s lost sight of He mumbles to himself

NICK (SING-SONGY)
You are retarded You area

Bickle following a mirage

And then -- he sees them turning another corner He sits
up slowing next to her

NICK
A beautiful long-legged mirage

He rolis down his window

NICK
who happens to be a man

He rolls up the window stepping on the gas again passing
the LONG-HAIRED HOMELESS MAN IN YELLOW STOCKINGS

NICK (TO HIMSELF)
Looking for answers

Nick turns the corner pulling up in front of the club just
in time for Norah to be running out

NICK (TO HIMSELF)
What answers I don’t even know
the fucking question

She opens the door out-of-breath
NORAH
How do you feel about Wheres
Fluffy
INT NICKS YUGO -- MOMENTS LATER

They drive again This time bubbling with energy the music
of Wheres Fluffy blaring around them

NICK
Theyre only the best punk band not

NORAH

nation oblivious to the fucking
terror its leaders wreak on the

NORAH (CUTTING HIM OFF)
You know I’m really not interested

The car skids a hundred-eighty degrees careening up on the
sidewalk before slamming into the street and into traffic

INT NICKS YUGO -- CONTINUOUS

He drives ahead She looks back to see one of his hubcaps
roll into a gutter behind them

Thom siams on the gas And the van skids off towards the
scene of the crime

Nick looks at her

sooner we find Fluffy And the
sooner this night is over

They make another sharp turn

Norah leans

A cymbal

flies back and nearly takes her head off with a crash

NORAH
And if you don’t have a drummer

She kicks the drums annoyed Dev turns to Thom

DEV
Fistful of Assholes

THOM

Nick smiles to himself But Norah can’t She leans back

NORAH (TO SELF)
Where are you Caroline

INT PORT AUTHORITY -- SAME TIME

Caroline (barely) stands at the one open ticket line across
from an OLD BLACK MAN (60s) behind glass

CAROLINE
I don’t have eleven dollars
BLACK MAN

CAROLINE
Total
BLACK MAN

CAROLINE

BLACK MAN
One dollar won’t get you to Newark

CAROLINE

She sneezes Her gum shoots out of her mouth onto the
glass along with some spittle She pulls the gum off the
glass puts it back in her mouth continues

CAROLINE
You don’t understand see I was
kidnapped Okay Guys in a van
talking about going balis deep
And I don’t know if you know but
theres such as a thing as white
slavery

The hardened black man looks back at her She starts to
remove her shoes Stumbling holding one up

CAROLINE

‘em give ‘em to your special lady
or hey keep ‘em for yourself
whatever I’m not a judger I just
need one ticket to Englewood Cliffs

BLACK MAN

CAROLINE
I don’t have eleven dollars

BLACK MAN
Then I don’t have no ticket

He slams his shade shut CLOSED

Caroline looks around The entire bus station is empty
except for a pair of IDENTICAL TWINS (male 30s dressed the
same) sitting in the waiting area Caroline makes her
drunken way towards them She clears her throat

CAROLINE

Hello Gentlemen I was
wondering if you fellows could help
me I’m trying to get a ride home
and it seems I’m a little shy

(then attempt at flirty)
Well obviously not shy I mean
I did come up to the two of you

We now see the “twins” across from her are actually just one
guy that she’s seeing double

CAROLINE
You see I was kidnapped and this
is America and if I can’t find a
way back to Jersey then the
terrorists have already won

The “twins” open their mouths and talk to her in unison

TWINS
I don’t have any cash

She squints her eyes THROUGH HER BEER GOGGLES the “TWINS”
begin to converge into Siamese

CAROLINE
Well what if I use one of your
guy’s tickets
(then)
I mean don’t you need just the
one

She moves her fingers together indicating they’re conjoined
The one guy looks back at her strangely

INT PORT AUTHORITY -- MOMENTS LATER
Norah and the guys rush in and look up at the sign

NORAH
Englewood Englewood Okay
last bus to Englewood left
(looking at clock)
Seven minutes ago

THOM
See there She caught the last
bus She’s fine

NORAH
Just cause there was a last bus
doesnt mean she was on it

THOM
Oh you and your logic

NORAH
I’m trying her again

Norah pulls out her cell phone

INT PORT AUTHORITY - BATHROOM STALL -- SAME TIME

Last stall Caroline vomits into the most disgusting toilet
in all of New York City Suddenly the distant sound of a
phone ringing -- the notes to Hava Nagila -- Caroline looks
around wondering where the sound is coming from

CAROLINE (CALLING OUT)
Can somebody get that

She finally realizes it’s coming from her jacket pocket She
pulls the phone out and looks at it with blurry eyes A
picture of Norah flipping the bird comes into focus

Caroline pushes a button to answer but in doing so pushes
the phone into the vomitfilled toilet Norah’s picture
sinking deeper and deeper the ringing muffled bubbling

Caroline gasps and her gum falls out of her mouth also into
the toilet Without pause Caroline pushes up her sleeve and
reaches into the murky water She fishes around then pulls
out her wad of gum

She puts the gum back in her mouth Reaches back in the
muck Fishes around again until she retrieves her phone

At this point a JANITOR has wheeled in with mop and bucket
a boom box blaring REGGAE MUSIC directly behind Caroline
Caroline puts the grossly dripping cell to her ear

CAROLINE
Norah Help

INTERCUT WITH

Norah on her phone -- the garbled sound of Caroline’s voice
coming through like she’s underwater --

NORAH
Caroline Where are you

The janitor looks in at Caroline’s mess

JANITOR
Aw hell no

Norah can’t hear Caroline over the janitor’s boom box

CAROLINE
Where are you

NORAH
Caroline Can you hear me

The call is lost

NORAH
Shit

NICK
Where is she

NORAH
I dont know TI couldn’t hear
anything over the music

DEV
Music What music

Thom snaps his fingers

THOM
She’s at the Red Room

DEV
Yeah course She didn’t leave the
city She probably caught wind of
the show and went there

THOM
She’s probably looking for you

Norah looks at them Knowing there’s a shred of truth in
there somewhere They wait for a response She looks at
Nick He gives a gesture -- c’mon

And finally -- she gives a slow conceding nod Dev claps
for joy She follows them towards the exit and off-screen

A moment later in the far distance Caroline emerges from
the bathroom wiping her mouth followed by the beat of the
janitor’s boom box THE MUSIC TAKES US TO

EXT THE RED ROOM -- LATER

Norah and the guys walk towards the club approaching the
back of the long line of young punks waiting out front

DEV
This is awesome

NORAH
This is ridiculous

The guys stop at the end of the line But Norah keeps moving
past them all towards the entrance The guys race to keep
up with her

NORAH
How did I get talked into this
What do we do if she’s not here
If when she’s not here Hi

They arrive at the front The BOUNCER (20s) looks at Norah
And the velvet rope is slid aside The guys scurry past too
excited to wonder how it happened and inside
49

INT THE RED ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

In darkness now the music growing louder as they move
through the crowd towards it But Nick can’t stop looking at
Norah Full of curiosity She finally notices

NORAH
What

NICK
Who are you

She almost smiles Then shrugs
NORAH
I’m Norah
(then a little shy)
I’m nobody

He squints at her

NORAH
I’m just the daughter of somebody
NICK NORAH
Daughter of who I’m gonna check the bathroom

And with that Norah takes off towards the girls’ room Nick
watches her go

DEV (0S)
Nicky

He turns The guys are calling for him from the center of
the pit The before-band DJ spinning a great track Nick
goes to join his friends

INT THE RED ROOM BATHROOM -- SAME TIME

Norah looks at herself in the mirror To her left and right
are LIP-GLOSSED GIRLS primping Norah looks at her
reflection Her reflection unbuttons her flannel one more

button Norah quickly buttons it up again

NORAH (TO HERSELF)
You are an ice box

She squeezes through the primping girls towards the door

INT THE RED ROOM - PIT -- MOMENTS LATER

Norah makes her way towards Nick and his buddies bouncing in
the middle of the mosh pit She looks at Nick from a few
feet away

He seems to be looking around For her She takes notice
smiles a bit as she taps him on the far shoulder He turns
all the way around to see her

NORAH
She wasnt in there

Nick smiles Norah’s presence an immediate comfort to him

NICK
Hey There you are I was about
to put up posters

He squeezes her shoulder And the electricity rushes through
her The crowd moves around them like water They are part
of it They are it Swaying pushing closer together

NICK
So what do you think

NORAH
About what

NICK
You think they’re gonna show

Then the DJ spins another track A WHERE’S FLUFFY SONG
And the crowd reacts Becoming an ocean

NORAH (SHOUTING OVER THE “NICK (SHOUTING OVER THE
MUSIC) MUSIC)
This is my song This is my song

The swaying becomes dancing Nick and Norah bounce with the
rhythm smiling laughing suddenly having a great time
Their bodies closer now Starting to sweat

NICK (SHOUTING OVER THE MUSIC)
You know

Then Norah is spun around and greeted with two full lips
pressed firmly against hers Nick watches waiting for her
to slug this guy But she doesn’t

TAL
Hey baby

This is TAL (18 Israeli attractive wearing a t-shirt that
reads “Challah Back”) Norah’s eyes widen

NORAH
Tal What are you doing here

TAL
What do you mean We’re looking
for Fluffy

He gestures to his THREE BANDMATES (all identical to Tal
dark hair darker clothes) looming behind him

TAL
What are you doing here

NORAH
Um were looking for Caroline

TAL (BEING FUNNY)
Caroline Cant you just follow
the umbilical cord
He over-laughs at his own joke Then reaches out to tickle
her ribs She laughs uncomfortably Tal throws an arm
around her neck looks up at Nick

TAL
Whats up

NICK
Hey

NORAH (MAKING INTRODUCTIONS)
Oh Nick this is Tal Tal this
is Nick

Tal reaches out shaking his hand

NORAH
Tris‘s latest victim

Tal laughs

TAL (LAUGHING)
Ouch

NORAH
They‘ve been helping me

Tal sees Nick’s bandmates behind him

TAL (A LITTLE RELIEVED)
Oh right you’re that gay

NICK
The Fuck-Offs We’re not all
TAL
The Fuck-Offs right I saw you

NICK (SMILING)
Asylum Yeah

TAL
Yeah you opened up for us And
then your amp blew out after one
song so you had to stop

Nick sinks a bit

TAL
You guys were good Despite being
one arm short of a Def Leppard
cover band

Tal laughs again Just then a HYPE MAN (30s) steps on-stage
and grabs the mic with a squeak Everyone turns their
attention up front The crowd begins chanting

CROWD
Flu-ffy Flu-ffy Flu-ffy

HYPE MAN (INTO THE MIC)
Alright alright We know what you
all came here for

Everybody cheers though Nick and Norah don’t seem to be as
much a part of it suddenly self-aware

HYPE MAN (INTO THE MIC)
Now I only have one question for
you people out there

Everyone screams

HYPE MAN (INTO THE MIC)
ARE YOU RANDY

Everyone collectively sighs as ARE YOU RANDY jumps on-stage
to begin their set
“53

TAL
The bait-and-switch

RANDY (INTO THE MIC)
One two three four

The music kicks in Everyone starts moving immediately

towards the exit Except for one guy who seems to be into
them Tal leads Norah by the hand towards the back of the
room where his boys stand around figuring out the night

Nick and the guys also move towards the back towards the
exit But Nick waits watching Norah and Tal catching
snippets of their conversation

DEV
Should we get going

NICK
Hangon

After a few more words Norah starts away from Tal He grabs
her hand and pulls her back for one last kiss Norah spins
around walking towards Nick without looking up at him

Tal already with a cell to his ear gives Nick a nod Nick
nods back as Norah spins him around by the jacket and leads
them through the machine of people towards the door

Tal watches them go

EXT THE RED ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

They emerge out front walking past the line of confused kids
still waiting slowly receiving the telephone of Fluffy’s no-
show Norah shivers in the night air

NICK
You alright

NORAH

NICK

Nick removes his jacket and wraps it around her shoulders as
they unknowingly pass the last person in line -- TRIS

in line with her new dude watching Nick and Norah down the
street climbing into the back of the van

The guys sit up front listening to a scratchy recording of
their own band still arguing band names

Nick and Norah ride in back Norah holds Caroline’s hair
while she pukes into a drum Caroline finishes hands the
drum to Norah and passes out in her lap

Norah looks at Nick holding up the drum

NORAH
At least you wont be needing this

He smiles She moves the drum as far away from them as
possible Nick looks at Norah His voice gets low

NICK (A SECRET)
You wanna know why our band doesn’t
have a drummer

Norah smiles shakes her head ‘yes’ Nick motions for her to
come closer She leans towards him He motions ‘closer’
She leans closer He whispers their faces inches away

NICK

We had a drummer David He was
bi-curious ‘til Dev got a hold of
him and turned him full-blown gay
After which Gayvid had a total

meltdown quit the band and with
him gone we suddenly went from

playing the meat-packing district
to the fudge-packing district and
never found anyone to replace him

Norah look at each other and laugh

Until tonight Caroline on

You must be really good friends

with her sleeve

He looks back at her She is about to say something But
she changes her mind

NORAH
Nice meeting you

eyes fixed on the spot where Nick disappeared Suddenly a
wad of gum is shoved in her face

CAROLINE
Here

Norah looks at the gum

CAROLINE
Just take it God

Caroline sticks the gum on Norah’s shoulder Norah looks at
the sticky wad Then at Caroline

Slowly Norah pulls the gum off in one long disgusting
strand She pulls her other arm out from under her friend’s
head and reaches for her cell phone

With a deep breath she dials a number DIALING -- TAL It
rings And rings She waits Without thinking she puts
the gum in her mouth Then

INT NICKS YUGO -- MOMENTS LATER

Nick manages to drive Tris lying in his back-seat

TRIS (0S)
The thumps in the road do you

She stretches as much as the cramped space will allow

TRIS

I feel so safe here Like when I
was a kid those late nights
riving home from some trip
somewhere The car was so huge it
was like like my parents were
driving my bed I couldnt help
but fall asleep Cause that car
it was like I was already home you
know

(then)
And thats how you feel Nicky
Like Im already home

He is rendered speechless

TRIS
Are you over me

Nick sighs defeated

NICK
How do you get over this

Tris sits up leaning towards him

TRIS
You know you wouldn’t have to get
over me if you were still under me

He tries to keep driving as she leans over and puts her
tongue in his ear Nicks eyes roll back though he doesn’t
look like he’s enjoying it The car nearly veers off-road

NICK
Wait wait

Tris tisks

TRIS
What’s with you

INT CLUB -- SAME TIME

TAL

Norah sits in the middle of a booth squeezed between Tal and
his band-mates She looks up

TAL

He points at the monogrammed name on Nick’s jacket She half-
smiles

TAL
You know you really look cute
tonight Even if you are wearing
some other dude’s jacket

She looks up at him

TAL
Come on Nor I haven’t seen you in
weeks Let’s make the most of it
okay

She gives in to his charm He kisses her cheek

NORAH
Okay
TAL
Well okay then so do you like it

Norah looks down CLOSE on a CD COVER OZ-RAEL Tal and his
three identical friends in the same outfits they’re wearing
tonight stand in front of a fiery star of David

TAL
Anarchy meets Zionism It’s
ironic

ONE FRIEND (TO NORAH)
You think Israel’s ready for us

TAL

Strummer died Army Radio 2 played
a three-hour Clash marathon Rock

TAL
What is this They charged us for
the first round

Tal holds the bill out to Norah

TAL
Can’t you talk to someone

Norah swallows Takes it in her hand None of the guys

move Norah has to slide under the table awkwardly climbing
out of the other side She walks towards the waitress And
then passes her Towards the exit light Her hands suddenly
ripping the bill into pieces She pushes the exit door open

TRIS (0S)

INT NICK’S YUGO -- SAME TIME

Nick drives bleary-eyed Tris beside him now

NICK
I don’t get you
TRIS
Whats to get I want to get back
together
He blinks
NICK
What
TRIS

I said I want to get back together
Nick looks at the road ahead
NICK
Im dreaming right I’ve been
sound asleep this whole time and
tonight is just one long strange

TRIS
Youre not dreaming

She takes his hand and puts it on her breast

TRIS
Pinch me

He looks at her FROU FROU’s Shh comes on the radio
TRIS
Lets go down by the river Turn

here

He takes his hand off her breast and turns down an empty
street asphalt replaced with pot-holed cobblestone

NICK
Tris I dont
TRIS
Shhh It’s okay baby Youre

with me now

Hand on his leg he stops in a small empty parking lot the
city lights have disappeared behind them New Jerseys
dwarfed skyline across the river

NICK
What are we doing

He turns to her She has hiked up her skirt a little He
notices She notices him noticing Then she cranks up the
radio and hops out of the car shutting the door behind her

Nick watches as she climbs onto the hood crawling with sex
on her hands and knees towards the windshield an inch of
glass separating them now She flips her hair around like
they do in videos and then kisses the glass a pink lip-
glossed imprint floating in front of Nick’s face

She slides off the hood runs a few feet and turns to face
him Standing in the headlights now her skirt see-through
her silhouette before him captured in the two yellow beams
darkness surrounding her music surrounding him

She moves to the beat Nick watches his mouth open as her
body moves her hands in the air rolling down her hair her
breasts her waist And slowly she begins to lift her
Ramones t-shirt up and up and up past her flat tan stomach
and ribs and exposing the black lace bra underneath With a
flip over her hair the shirt is off

She swirls it in circles above her head like a mock strip-
tease to the blaring music and tosses it on the hood
playfully Nick looks on There she is She’s right there

Tris puts a thumb underneath each bra strap tugging at them
in rhythm letting them hang off her shoulders as she reaches
for the clasp behind her back unhooks it then --

The car moves in reverse The sound of gravel as the Yugo
skids back the headlights turning away from Tris

TRIS
Hey

Nick drives ahead his huge eyes blinking in disbelief of
what he’s just done -- Tris’s body barely an outline in the
darkness behind him --

Only the lip-glossed mark of Tris’s mouth remains And with
the push of a button the wiper fluid sprays and the half-
broken wipers wash her kiss away

Nick suddenly starts to laugh it erupts slowly at first
then hysterically as he turns his car onto Tenth Ave back
into late-night traffic back to the lights of Manhattan He
grips the steering wheel shaking it with laughter and
reaches for the phone in his jacket pocket

There is no jacket pocket Hes not wearing his jacket

He stops laughing Thinking And then he smiles

INT VESELKA -- MOMENTS LATER

She smiles lLeans in to him

NORAH
There are so many experiences
that only Tal and I have shared
You know Things that only he and

Nick starts to sink She pulls him back in

NORAH
I think thats what happens when
you break up with someone

Its like the other half of your
memories just disappears And
youre only left with your version
And after awhile you dont even
remember that right

He nods

NICK

She looks up at him

NORAH

He smiles

emerging out of the other side Park Ave The streets are
empty The skyscrapers are magnificent Better than they
know Norah is driving the Yugo while scanning Nick’s iPod

NORAH
I cant believe your library
Youre like my musical soulmate

NICK (NERVOUS)
Hey why dont I DJ for a little
bit

NORAH
You dont like my grooves

NICK
Id just like to distract myself
from the fact that youre driving
my car

She smiles Looks out at the looming skyscrapers

e NORAH
Hey my dad works around here

NICK

She pulls the car into an empty parking lot Points up ata
towering building

NORAH
See that building with the
gargoyles Hes up on the top
floor
(then)
I have the key with me

NICK
You want to go up there

NORAH

NICK
I bet the view is sick

She looks up at the windows again Suddenly flustered
89

NORAH
Maybe we shouldnt
(thinking)
Yeah forget it Forget it

NICK
You sure

NORAH
Nevermind

She throws the car in reverse and backs up BANG The car
comes to an abrupt stop and sinks The tires hiss

Norah turns to the parking lot sign that reads Do Not Back-
Up Severe Tire Damage She turns back to Nick

INT ELEVATOR -- LATER

They ride the elevator together To the top floor Not
talking Barely looking at each other

NORAH
Well just call a tow truck

INT RECORD LABEL -- LATER

Norah unlocks the door and they step inside Lights on
Nick takes in the IMPRESSIVE STUDIO filled with equipment
that could make planes fly walls covered in gold records
His eyes light up at a wall of INSTRUMENTS

NICK
What exactly does your father do

NORAH
You mean you really dont know
Nick nods no She smiles
NICK

Well are you gonna tell me or not
She says nothing Nick scans the walls There are photos of
her father everywhere with Christina Aguilera with Bo Bice
with Dashboard Confessional

NICK
Is this him

Norah nods ‘yes’ Nick looks at the pictures

NICK
So what is he like a former
hippie current yuppie corporate
sell-out spoon-feeding the masses
the same old stop me at any time

NORAH
Are you kidding You practically
quoted my graduation speech

Norah beams from ear to ear Nick doesn’t even realize the
wall he’s torn down He takes a GUITAR off the wall begins
walking and strumming

NICK
Is this the job you got lined up

Norah leans into a chair

NORAH
It’s mine if I want it
NICK
But you don’t want it
NORAH
I don’t know
(thinking)
I love music I live for it But
I’m afraid if I work in it in
here then I might not love it

the same way anymore Does that
make sense

He nods ‘yes’

NORAH
I loved your mixes by the way

He looks at her

NORAH
The ones you made for Tris
NICK
You saw those
NORAH
One or two Seven I own seven of

them

They both smile a little embarrassed Norah makes a
confession

NORAH

Nick smiles strumming the guitar a little livelier

NICK
What was your favorite song

NORAH

NICK (STILL STRUMMING)
Well howd it go

His guitar accompanies their conversation again

NICK
I didnt write it for her if

NORAH
Could you play it

NICK
Right now

You wanna lay it down

She quickly wheels towards the CONTROLS He takes the guitar
into the RECORDING BOOTH Cracks his knuckles Fingers on
the strings But he changes his tune

NICK (SINGING)
I never shoulda let you drive my
car Now shell be sent to the
junk yard Poor poor Jessie

NORAH (LAUGHING)

They talk through the INTERCOM He strums a SLOW MELODY

NICK
Its cool She falls apart and I
put her back together again

NORAH
Kinda like me and Caroline
(then)
Tikkun olam

NICK
What’s that

NORAH (SLOWLY)

Its this one part of Judaism that
I really like Conceptually I
mean Its called tikkun olam
Basically it says that the world
has been broken into pieces And
theres all this chaos And its
our job everyones job to try to
find the pieces and put them back
together To make things whole

again

NICK
Do you think that That its all
chaos

NORAH
Most of the time yeah But if we
all do our part tikkun olam

They are silent for a moment

NICK
Maybe were the pieces

She looks at him through the glass He leans into the
microphone

NICK
Maybe thats what its about The
world being broken

(MORE)

NICK (contd)

Maybe it isnt that were supposed
to find the pieces Maybe we are
the pieces

Her heart races She pushes the intercom

NORAH
Nick

NICK
Yeah

NORAH

Im coming in

She rolls the chair back and stands Making her way towards
the recording booth He prepares for her arrival Stops
strumming the guitar But the music continues as she walks
into the booth and closes the door behind her

Leaning into him Kissing him Good Slow Happening
His hands on her face They talk close between the kisses

NORAH
I wont compete with her

NICK

He kisses her again Removing Salvatores jacket She
unbuttons her flannel Drops it to the floor He takes her
in Kisses her neck

NORAH

His hands tug at the top button of her jeans popping it
open Her eyes close

NORAH
Pretty like that
NICK

NORAH

He pulls away just far enough to look at her face

NICK
Norah You’re beautiful

She kisses him now Big and wet Pulls his shirt over his
head He pops another button on her jeans She gasps
leaning back against the wall He presses against her
Another button And another

NORAH
What are we doing

NICK
I dont know

And another and His hand slides in And in Norah leans
her head back He kisses her neck Touching her still Her
breath quickens

IN THE STUDIO we see the recording’s red bars spiking as
Norahs breath gets louder and louder and suddenly

She lets out a shockingly pleasurable sound She stops him
catching her breath

NORAH
Oh God wait

NICK
Are you okay

NORAH
I dont know

NICK

NORAH
No I just

She looks at him A huge grin spreads across her face She
kisses him again He slides down her neck her chest her
stomach and suddenly the LIGHTS BEAM ON

Norah and Nick drop to the floor She closes her eyes

NORAH
Tell me its not my father

Nick peeks up to see a JANITOR keys in hand cleaning up

NICK
It’s not your father

They smile at each other He gives her one last kiss

INT RECORD LABEL -- MOMENTS LATER

Nick and Norah sneak past the janitor bursting into the
hallway up to the elevators Norah quickly pushes DOWN
Nick looks out the window at the city lights forty-five
floors below them Norah looks at him suddenly sad

NORAH
IT guess that’s it

He turns to her

NORAH
It’s tomorrow

Nick smiles

NICK
Not yet

He points to something Norah comes to the window From
their vantage point they can see it

In the distance the white lights of a nearby skyscraper

shaped into the outline of a rabbits head -- its ears
pointing up to the roof top -- where a stage is being set up
NORAH

Theres Fluffy

Nick and Norah look at each other The elevator DINGS

INT THE VAN -- SAME TIME

The guys make their way towards the Lincoln Tunnel
exhausted yawning Caroline passed out in back They’re
still trying to talk of band names but the RADIO DJs voice
comes through --

THOM
Shhh listen

Thom turns the volume up

DI (0S)
Supposed to show up at the Red
Room tonight but it looks like
Where’s Fluffy is gonna be at

DEV
Yes yes

OTHER DJ (0S)

DI (0S)
Alright we’ll give you a hint

The van pulls into the Lincoln Tunnel

DJ
Five Sixty-eight One hundred
and twenty-one

The radio cuts out -- nothing but static inside the tunnel

DEV (LOSING IT)
Oh -come on

THOM (SHOUTING)

DEV
What did he say again

BEEFY GUY
Five sixty-nine

THOM (SHOUTING)

of the gutter

DEV

alphabet A B

THOM
There aren’t sixty-eight letters in
the alphabet

DEV
Well think damn it

BEEFY GUY

eight that’s

THOM
Okay what else Subways Uh

CAROLINE (0S)

The guys look back at Caroline propped up against the drums
her eyes still closed but her mouth is moving

CAROLINE
Fifth avenue at sixty-eighth
Street New York New York one
zero zero two one

The guys’ eyes widen as the van emerges out the other side
of the Lincoln Tunnel the radio returns with blaring music

Thom slams on the brakes and cuts the wheel skidding through
a row of orange cones Caroline’s body flies against the
van’s wall knocking her eyes open She’s blinks back in

The van careens back through the tunnel back to Manhattan

EXT CITY STREET -- SAME TIME

Nick and Norah run hand-in-hand towards the building The
closer they get to the building more and more kids join them
on their way to Fluffy

EXT FIFTH AND SIXTY-EIGHTH -- MOMENTS LATER

They arrive at the tall building the outline of the rabbit
pointing them up and up and up The flow of Fluffy fans make
their way inside Nick and Norah follow

INT STAIRWELL -- MOMENTS LATER

Converse sneakers Vans biker boots stomping up the stairs
making their frenzied way towards the roof top concert

Among the crowd they climb the stairs exhausted out-of-
breath knowing it’ll be worth it Nick helps Norah along
the way all the while holding her hand

EXT ROOF TOP -- MOMENTS LATER

They emerge onto the roof All of Manhattan surrounding them
now The sea of punk kids move around the stage like a pack
of animals chanting for Fluffy howling at the moon

But when Nick and Norah take their first step forward they

see what they’ve gotten into -- Caroline Dev Thom Lethario
-- Tris and her dude - Tal and his friends --
CAROLINE

Norah Where have you been

They all turn to see them Nick and Norah immediately
release hands And the hounds are released Tal is the
first in Norahs face --

TAL
What the fuck

As Tris storms up to Nick --

TRIS
You asshole

TAL (TO NORAH)
What are you doing Showing up
with this guy trying to embarrass
me in front of my boys

Tris gets in Nicks face

TRIS
Do you realize I had to walk back
to tenth by myself I could’ve
been raped or killed and you never
once let me wear your jacket

NICK
What are you jealous

TAL (TO NORAH)
I don’t get jealous

NORAH (TO TAL)
Right that would require actually
liking somebody for who they are

TAL
What’s gotten into you

TRIS (TO NICK)
It‘s like I dont even know who you
are anymore

NICK
Thats right You don’t

Tris looks at him shocked
TRIS
Nobody has ever treated me like

this before

And by the look on her face it’s working She grabs Nick’s
face and kisses him Over Tal’s shoulder Norah sees this

TAL (TO NORAH)
So what are you saying

Norah storms away from the lip-lock Tal in tow

TAL (CONT’D)
Norah I’m talking to you

Nick pulls Tris off of his lips

TRIS (ANNOYED)
What TI like you

NICK
No you don’t You just can’t
stand the idea of me being out
there not-tortured over you

Norah squeezes through the crowd Tal following
TAL

So what does this make it Six or
seven times

NORAH
Ive stopped counting

Tris presses against Nick

TRIS
Youre rejecting me

Tal spins Norah around

TAL
You’re rejecting me

TRIS (TO NICK)
For Norah

Tris looks at Nick her eyes welling

TRIS (CONT’D)
I can’t believe this

She lowers her head Nick doesn’t know how to console her
But then she lifts her head up laughing Nick walks away
from her towards Tal and Norah

TAL
So that’s it Its over

Tal suddenly looks genuinely hurt

TAL
But you’re still gonna give your
dad our cd right

Norah’s eyes narrow Suddenly the lights go out The crowd
cheers WHERES FLUFFY takes the stage and the music kicks
in Fast and hard Norah just looks at Tal

TAL (SHOUTING OVER MUSIC) (CONTD)
C’mon Nor We worked really hard
on it and you promised

Nick comes up to them

TAL (CONT’D)
Will you back the fuck up Sal

Tal shoves Nick Nick comes towards him

NICK
That’s Sal-vatore

The bass is heavy Beating through the crowd The mosh pit
picks up the pace moving around them like a whirlpool

Tal looks at Nick and Norah like he’s suddenly putting the
pieces together

TAL
What is it Things didn’t work
with your girl so you gotta steal
somebody elses

fal shoves Nick again Nick’s friends perk up watching
The roof has become a blizzard of arms and legs and strobe

NICK
You push me again

TAL
And then what You and your band
of merrymen will blow me to death

Tal backs up like a coward Nick comes towards him

NICK
I’m warning you

TAL
Go ahead You can have her Have
fun with the Tin Woman here But
be careful she tends to rust if
you get her wet

Nick reels back and punches Tal in the face knocking him to
the ground His friends react They jump Nick

Nicks friends react Dev slaps one guy in the face Thom
gets taken down by another The Beefy Guy loses it hulking
out knocking people left and right

Caroline continues to dance rocking out to Where’s Fluffy
in her own little world amidst the chaos

Suddenly the fight is only between Tals friends and Nick’s
friends Nick Norah Tal and Tris are at its center
looking at each other
Tal touches his nose now bleeding
TAL (SHOUTING OVER MUSIC) (CONT’D)
Three years with Ira Silverberg’s
daughter and where did it get me
Tris puts a hand on Tal comforting him
TRIS (SHOUTING TO NICK)
Oh and by the way I was
cheating on you the entire time

The dance floor is a flurry And as Nick and Norah stand
there amidst their demons --

THEY LOCK EYES --
THE ROOM SLOWS DOWN AROUND THEM --

VOICES ARE MUFFLED --

THE SOUND CHANGES --

And in one quick flash -- they decide -- without words Nick
takes hold of her hand And they make their escape --

Caroline finally looks up in shock

CAROLINE
Norah

Norah looks back at her

CAROLINE (CONT’D)
Whos gonna take me home

But Norah turns her back on Caroline following Nick
bursting through the door --

INT STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

Back down the spiral of stairs that led them there racing
down every flight --

EXT CITY STREETS -- MOMENTS LATER

Running hand-in-hand down the city sidewalks -- The pink
light of morning finally emerging and lighting their way
until they find subway steps --

INT SUBWAY STATION -- MOMENTS LATER

Up to the turnstile Nick pulls out a METROCARD He turns
to Norah Out of breath

NICK
This will get us downtown where we
can catch the PATH to Hoboken
where my sister will loan me her
ear so I can finally get you home
And there you will sleep for eight
wonderful hours until I wake you
with a phone call asking to see you
again to see you as much as
possible before you leave for
wherever it is you’re going

The train is approaching He slides the Metrocard through
the machine and pushes through the turnstile handing the
ecard back to her The train whistles to a stop

She slides the Metrocard But it beeps Insufficient Fare

NICK (CONT’D)
Jump over

She hesitates seconds ticking by

NICK (CONTD)
Are we in this or not

He holds out his hand to her She looks at the train

NICK (CONT’D)
Cmon Norah Itll be gone soon

But the train doors close And after a moment they open
again Norah takes hold of his hand And takes a breath

CuT TO BLACK
