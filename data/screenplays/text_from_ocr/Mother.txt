FIRE
Everywhere

We see just a WOMAN’S EYES defiant sad defeated
but free

Her eyes close as everything becomes

WHITE

And from the light a

CHARRED BOOKCASE
Hands place a CRYSTAL FORMATION on a burnt shelf

They belong to HIM His eyes torn with misery and sadness
He calms down Closes his eyes Wishes

Slowly color repairs the shelf returning it to an un-burnt
state

Now dawn light reveals glimpses inside a

HOME

Repairing itself from a fire the front door a hand rail a
window onto the porch the plaster work along the ceiling
the ruffled sheets on a comfortable bed in the

MASTER BEDROOM

They come back to life A body emerges before us A young
woman in that comfortable bed reaching for her man Empty
She turns into camera This is MOTHER alone her partner now
gone

She sits up and looks around

MOTHER
Baby

A moment of concern She slips on her robe and heads down
the stairs past a
STUDY

The door is open but the room is empty She closes the door
and continues down the open

STAIRWELL

The front door is closed The dining room is empty So is
the drawing room

She rushes through the

HALLWAY

Peeks into an empty bedroom and marches into the

KITCHEN

She looks out the window Dawn reveals the rolling hills
No one is out there

She rushes past the pantry and the dining room and into the

FOYER

She opens the door steps out onto the porch and stares into
the blinding morning sun

She doesn’t see anyone It is chilly so she quickly turns
to head inside and bumps into HIM

MOTHER
You scared me

HIM
Sorry Didn’t mean to

He kisses her She melts into it Happy Nowhere she’d
rather be She sees the dirt on his shirt

MOTHER
You were outside

He nods

MOTHER
Why didn’t you wake me

HIM
I wanted to be alone
That stings a little He keeps going
HIM
I mean I needed to clear my head
get the ideas flowing

MOTHER
And did they

His face says it all

HIM
No

MOTHER
They will Don’t worry it’1l
come

He starts to pull away doesn’t like this kind of talk She
grabs him and hugs him hard Tries for another kiss

But he pulls away

HIM
I must stink

She smiles at him inviting

MOTHER
I like it

HIM
Id better shower

He smiles turns and leaves She watches him go to the
stairs Something creeps into her bliss She steps inside
and closes the front door

Later in the

DRAWING ROOM

She mixes plaster A perfectionist when it comes to details
she carefully makes sure the tone is the perfect off-yellow
But she can’t seem to get it quite right

None of this is a chore She enjoys every moment But still
she is frustrated a bit

She walks to the blank wall She puts her hands against it
She breathes the scratch coat as she closes her eyes to the
DARKNESS OF HER IMAGINATION

She hears air breathe between the home’s walls the deep
rhythmic beat of its mechanical systems the fluids flowing
through its pipes We see the house we see her we see
them Back in the

DRAWING ROOM

She looks back at her mixture She knows exactly what is
wrong She opens a small old wooden box filled with vials of
colored powders She adds some from one filled with a
yellowish tint

As she mixes it a smile creeps in The color is right She
starts to plaster Later in the

KITCHEN

Mother finishes cleaning dishes at the sink She has just
prepared two beautiful plates of food but the kitchen is
spotless there’s no mess HIM enters and reaches for a pair
of drinking glasses

HIM
Can I grab these

MOTHER
I got it

He carries the glasses to the table by the windows He sits
down and opens up his napkin She serves him

HIM
Perfect You didn’t need to do all
of this

MOTHER
I wanted to You’ve been working
so hard

HIM

(sarcastic)
Yeah right

He digs in barely looking at her Later in the
STUDY

The room is mostly finished The shelves are filled with
autobiographies of all shapes and sizes One shelf is filled
with citations and BRASS awards

She adds a log to the fire then settles into a comfy chair
with a thick book

HIM stares out the window An idea comes to him He goes to
his desk and sits down

She sneaks a peek hopeful

He looks at a blank page Nothing comes to him He fiddles
with his pen and looks at his awards Then he looks out the
window

She starts to read again

There’s a KNOCK at the front door

They look at each other That’s strange She starts to rise
but he gets up quicker

HIM
(slight concern)
Wait here
He heads out of the room She waits a few moments

She looks at the papers on his desk BLANK

All the pages are BLANK She heads towards the

FRONT DOOR

She can’t see who it is because the front door blocks her
view but HIM stands listening to whoever is there

HIM
Please come in

He opens the door wider and MAN enters sees Mother and
removes his cap

MAN
Oh hello

MOTHER
Hello
HIM
So this gentleman here just started
working at the hospital and he
thought we were
(curious to Man)
What do you do there

MAN
I’m an orthopedic surgeon

HIM
Really

MAN
But mostly now I do research And
teach

HIM
Research

MAN
Yes I know it’s bit boring

HIM
(laughing)
Not boring at all Sit fora
second Can we get you anything to
drink

MAN
No that’s fine
MOTHER
Some tea
MAN

No I don’t want to be a bother

HIM
You must A guest and a doctor
who knows I might trip down the
stairs one day

MAN
Let’s hope not

MOTHER
(smiles)
I’1l go make some

MAN
Thank you
HIM
This way please Sorry for the
mess we are moving in after months
of construction
Mother heads out of the room

MAN
It’s an incredible place

HIM
My wife loves having company

MAN
Your wife I thought it was your
daughter

She looks back aghast Buries it and heads into the

KITCHEN

Behind her HIM invites Man to sit in the partially finished
drawing room

She turns on the kettle and prepares three cups One slips
and shatters on the floor

HIM (0S)
You all right

MOTHER
(barely squeaks)
Fine
But she’s not Her chest tightens -- the space right beneath
her STERNUM Her breaths get shallow She feels real
discomfort

The house shifts slightly her reality on fire She fights
to re-find her breath Some sweat on her brow

After a moment the pain passes She cleans up the broken tea
cup She replaces it as the kettle whistles

Then she carries everything back to the

DRAWING ROOM

Where Man and HIM sip whiskey
MAN
There was this one case it was
an opera singer late twenties
Her femurs were rotated so far
inward that she couldn’t spread her
knees more than a foot apart

HIM
Really
MAN
(to Mother)

Why thank you
Mother lays down the tray
MOTHER

(re whiskey)
You upgraded Where’d that come

from
MAN
I always carry a supply
HIM
I’ve never tasted something like

this
Mother notices the man beam at the compliment

MAN
(to Mother)
It’s hard to come by I had to
share Won’t you join

HIM

She’s not much of a drinker
MOTHER

I drink
MAN

Well here let me put a little in
your tea

HIM hopes she will But she decides against it
MOTHER
(blush)
I’m fine with tea Thank you

HIM laughs and stands up moving to sit next to Mother
kissing her hand
HIM
The good doctor here is about to
publish a major paper--

MAN
“About” is generous I still have
reams of research to write up

HIM
And he’s moved here to finish it

There’s an awkward silence Mother fills in the silence

MOTHER
And what brings you to us

MAN
Well they told me I could find a
room here

HIM
He thought we were a bed and
breakfast

Mother laughs A half laugh After another beat he
continues

HIM
We always talk about how this place
is too big for the two of us

Mother looks at HIM A pause
MAN

Well I really should be going if
I’m going to find--

HIM
Nonsense It’s late stay the
night

MAN

No I couldn’t

HIM
Please wed enjoy the company
(turns to Mother)
Right

Mother stutters but covers

MOTHER
Yes of course

MAN
Are you sure

HIM
Positive

MAN
Well then I’1l just grab the rest
of my stuff That’s incredibly
kind and generous I just left it--
Man starts to cough as he heads out the door

HIM
You all right

MAN
I’m fine just went down the wrong
tube
They follow him into the
FOYER

As he exits Once they’re alone she turns to HIM

MOTHER
We don’t know him

HIM
He’s a doctor

MOTHER
He’s a stranger We’re just going
to let him sleep in our house

HIM
You want me to ask him to leave

He looks at Mother She subtly shrugs
But then Man returns with a TOTE BAG

HIM
Is that all

MAN
That’s everything

HIM helps the man and takes the bag

Man pops a cigarette in his mouth and lights it with a METAL
LIGHTER
MOTHER
Um we don’t smoke

MAN
That’s smart

MOTHER
In the house I mean

MAN
Sorry

Man flicks the cigarette out the door

MOTHER
Ill go get you some linens

HIM
I’1l show you to your room

As HIM leads Man to the guest bedroom Mother heads
the
BASEMENT

Next to the boiler are stacks of moving boxes She
rifle through them to find some sheets and towels

down into

starts to

Then she hears a RUMBLE from the wall behind the boiler A

strange noise

She nears the back WALL behind the boiler She hears the
RUMBLE again She turns on a light and inches closer to the

wall

Then something BANGS against the wall Mortar dust
air She YELPS and stumbles back

in the

The nearby boiler turns on This calms her Must be

connected

Upstairs she enters the

GUEST BEDROOM

The man’s bag is there but they are not She starts to make

the bed when she hears them down the hall

She follows the voices to the stairwell just beneath the

STUDY
And stops to listen
MAN (0S)
Oh and this I love this How come
you have so many copies

A brief pause

HIM
Well I wrote it

MAN
Oh my That’s you I’m a huge
fan

HIM

Youve read it

She smiles to herself glowing in HIM’s success She moves

INSIDE
HIM and Man stand before the book case They notice her
MAN
I’ve read it many many times

Your words changed my life

HIM smiles with false modesty

MAN
I’m sorry you must hear that all
the time

HIM

Not really no
Man spies something else on the shelf

MAN
(notices something)
And that

He points at the beautiful CRYSTAL FORMATION resting on a
stand The same from the opening of the film It’s framed
boldly in the center of the bookshelf

MAN
What is it

He reaches for it But HIM reaches quickly to stop him
Then he carefully takes it down from the shelf himself

HIM
Careful this is very very
delicate It was a gift

MAN
A very special gift Is it from
you

He looks at Mother

MOTHER
No

HIM doesn’t let it out of his hands He shows it to Man as
he cradles it

HIM
When I was younger I lost
everything in a fire

MAN
I’m sorry

HIM
It’s hard to imagine what that
means Losing everything Your
memories your work even your
dirty toothbrush I didn’t even
know if I could ever create again
Until I found this in the ashes
Isn’t that remarkable It gave me
the strength to start again

He holds the crystal Man holds his breath

HIM
And then I met her
(to Mother)
You
(back to Man)
And she breathed life back into
every room

He carefully sets the crystal back on the shelf It takes a
moment for Man to remember where he is

HIM
She re-did all of it

Man is still thinking about the crystal
HIM
Every last detail

MAN
(waking up)
By yourself

MOTHER
Mmhm

MAN
So you’re not just a pretty face

That’s a bit rude Mother darkens
MOTHER
I just came up to say I’m going to

get ready for bed

MAN
I’m sorry I didn’t mean--

Man coughs The cough gets worse and doesn’t let up

HIM
You okay Want some water

MOTHER
Are you all right

Man waves it off and points at his empty whiskey glass
HIM starts pouring turns to Mother
HIM
I’1l be up soon
(now to Man)
You’re sure you don’t want some

water

She retreats

LATER

In the middle of the night Mother sleeps She reaches
HIM but the bed is empty

She sits up concerned The

for

STUDY

Is empty She continues downstairs and smells cigarette
smoke In the

GUEST BEDROOM

She peeks into the empty room A glass bowl filled with
cigarette butts sits next to his METAL LIGHTER

She frowns Then she hears coughing from the

GUEST BATHROOM

Standing with his back to her is HIM He gently strokes the
naked back of Man who violently coughs into the toilet

Mother can’t believe it

MOTHER
Is everything all right

HIM spins around

HIM
He drank too much He’1l be fine

She tries to get a better glimpse of Man There’s something
on his back An open wound maybe

MOTHER
What is--

HIM
(strong whisper)
Give him some privacy
The force of the words startle her Suspiciously she
retreats back into the

GUEST BEDROOM

Her chest gets tight as she loses her breath She spots the
METAL LIGHTER again

HIM (0S)
Get it out lLet’s get it all out

Passive aggressively she SLIDES the METAL LIGHTER off the
bureau into the gap behind the furniture

When she gets to the

MASTER BATHROOM

She tries to take a full breath but she can’t fill her lungs
She opens the medicine cabinet There’s a few empty amber
bottles She finds one with yellow powder She adds it to a
glass of water She drinks the tincture

Slowly her breath settles She feels a lot better

Later in the

MASTER BEDROOM

She crawls back into the empty bed The next morning in the

KITCHEN

Mother preps breakfast HIM wanders in rubbing sleep from
his eyes He kisses her forehead

HIM
Good morning

MOTHER
Morning

HIM

Smells great
This makes her grin slightly He peeks out the window

MOTHER
What happened last night

HIM
I couldn’t sleep I got so
excited

MOTHER
From what

HIM
His stories I love the man’s
mind It is so inspiring speaking
with someone who really appreciates
the work

MOTHER
I love your work

HIM
Of course you do I know that

He wanders to the bathroom to relieve himself

MOTHER
So is he better

HIM (0S)
Pardon

MOTHER
(Louder )
Is he feeling better
But there’s no answer
MOTHER
(louder still)
Is he all right

HIM (0S)
Fine fine one sec

She returns to her cooking She adds some pepper and salt

She turns to the fridge and nearly SLAMS into Man She
JUMPS

MAN
Oh sorry Just need a light

Man motions to the stove She recovers and steps back
MAN
Don’t worry about it I’1ll take it

outside Morning

MOTHER
Morning How are you feeling

MAN
Wonderful

Man heads out the back door

MOTHER
You’re all better

MAN

HIM returns from his piss

HIM

MAN

MAN
Like a baby Really vivid dreams
Must be the air

MOTHER
Wait I’m confused--

The door bell RINGS Mother looks surprised at HIM

MOTHER
Who’s that

HIM

MOTHER
No don’t I’11 get it

Shes already moving to the

FRONT DOOR
On the porch is WOMAN Suitcase by her side

MOTHER
Hello

WOMAN
Hello

There’s an awkward pause

MOTHER
Can I help you

Man rushes forward cigarette still in hand and hugs Woman

MAN
Ah you made it

Mother looks to HIM who’s just arrived He raises his
eyebrows unsure what to make of it

MAN
My better half
WOMAN
(re cigarette)

Get rid of that thing won’t you

MAN
I’m not inhaling

Woman snatches the cigarette from Man and tosses it They
kiss It lasts a beat too long

HIM
Nice to meet you

WOMAN
The pleasure is mine

HIM
Well come in

And they do

MOTHER
I didn’t realize you were married

MAN
Really

It hangs there The smoke alarm RINGS

MOTHER
Breakfast

HIM
Ill grab her suitcase

Mother rushes back to the

KITCHEN

Where the pan is burnt and smoking She grabs it Too hot
to touch She cries out

Everyone rushes in Woman sees the smoking pan

WOMAN
Oh it’s burning

She grabs the pan as well

MOTHER
No don’t

Too late The woman drops the pan to the floor as she
Oil and food splatter across the floor

screams
WOMAN
Oh sorry
MOTHER
I got it
HIM

I’1l get the window

Mother grabs a dishrag and takes the pan HIM throws open
the windows to air out the smoke

Woman is in pain Man examines her hand
MAN
(to woman)

Let me take a look at it

MOTHER
Are you all right

WOMAN
I think so

HIM fans the fire alarm

MAN
Youre okay
(to Mother)
Ice
MOTHER
Ice

Mother grabs some and wraps it in a dishrag

WOMAN
So stupid

MAN
It’s not bad It’s fine you’re
fine

MAN
(to Mother)
Thank you

MOTHER
I’m really so sorry

WOMAN
Oh don’t worry about it It’s
very nice to meet you

MOTHER
Very nice to meet you

The alarm finally snaps off Later in the

DINING ROOM

HIM Man and Woman all eat Mother is still bringing some
things to the table Woman plucks a few things off the
plates even before Mother puts them down

MAN

I had given up on romance I was
getting used to being alone

(to Mother)
Oh thank you

(Back to group)
But then it just happened for us
I saw her and I knew she was the
woman I wanted to spend the rest of
my life with

Mother smiles Man sees it

MAN
Love at first sight

WOMAN
Same here

MAN
(not believing)
Yeah right

WOMAN
What How could I resist this
face
(turns to Mother)
You believe me right

Mother doesn’t know how to answer She just shrugs and
continues to serve breakfast

HIM
(to Mother)
Sit already
(MORE)

HIM (CONTD)
(jokey to Man)
So you never had a doubt

Man shakes his head as Mother sits

WOMAN
That’s true

MAN
(to Woman)
Did you have any doubts

WOMAN
(cheeky )
No not a one

That makes Man chuckle He smiles

WOMAN
You guys understand that kind of
connection right You must I
mean you’re both so different must
have been what pulled you together

MAN
You’re so beautiful Come here

Man pulls Woman’s chin They lock lips The kiss slips into
slightly inappropriate tongue

Mother feels weird She looks at HIM He stares at the
couple

The woman finally pulls away

WOMAN
And then the kids came and screwed
it all up
Man laughs
HIM

You have kids

MAN
Two Boys

He pulls out his phone and shares some images

HIM
Beautiful

MAN
Here this is my eldest
HIM
Let me see

Man changes the picture and motions to the woman

MAN
And then her baby

WOMAN
Oh shut up

HIM
Amazing eyes

Mother smiles HIM hands the phone back to Woman

WOMAN
And you two

There’s an awkward beat

WOMAN
You have kids

HIM
Not yet But we want them

Mother looks at HIM Really

WOMAN
Well what are you waiting for Why
not finish breakfast and get to
it

HIM eats doesn’t say anything After an awkward beat
Mother jumps in

MOTHER
Well I want to finish the house
And he’s working on a new piece--

MAN
So you are writing again That’s
wonderful

WOMAN
Finally right

HIM
Yes

MAN
(realizing)
Oh no We’re in the way That’s
the last thing in the world--

HIM
No no not at all You’re more
than welcome to stay here as long
as you want

Mother is startled to hear that

MAN
That’s very kind of you

WOMAN
No we couldn’t impose

MAN
(to Woman)
Honey they’ve got plenty of room

The woman looks at her cell phone
WOMAN
Speaking of kids do you have a

phone I can’t get a signal

HIM
That’s how we like it

MAN
You don’t need to call him every
day--

MOTHER

There’s one in the kitchen I can
show you

WOMAN
No that’s all right

Woman leads Man out of the room

MAN
Can we just relax for the weekend--

WOMAN
No honey I just want to let him
know we’re okay

Alone now HIM senses Mother’s distance

HIM
What’s wrong

MOTHER
Why would you do that without
asking me

HIM
Do what

MOTHER
Invite them to stay

HIM
I didn’t think it was a big deal

MOTHER
It’s strange

HIM
What

MOTHER
Did you know he had a wife

He shakes his head

MOTHER
What about your writing

He sighs
HIM
I was actually enjoying not
thinking about it But now that I
am thinking about it I should go
and do something about it
He gets up and heads to work
She grabs him
MOTHER
(getting serious)

Hey

He lowers his eyes Forgiving She gives him a look He
looks back All forgiven A simple kiss

HIM
I really should work

He leaves She’s alone Later in the
DRAWING ROOM

Mother stands on a bench plastering the wall above the
mantle She’s working her way through the room

WOMAN (0OS)
Lemonade

Woman enters carrying two glasses of lemonade They’re
filled very much to the brim and spilling a bit

MOTHER
(playfully)
Whoops careful

The guest puts one glass down but it spills a bit on an
uncovered end table

WOMAN
Thought you might like some

MOTHER
Yes thank you

WOMAN
Secret family recipe

MOTHER
Which part The lemons

Woman doesn’t really get it She just stares at Mother
Mother goes back to work

MOTHER
How’s your hand

WOMAN
Still stinging

Mother turns back

MOTHER
I’m sorry

WOMAN
It’s not like it was your fault
(a thought)
You don’t have any painkillers do
you

Mother pauses for a moment Then shakes her head no

WOMAN
Are you telling me the truth

MOTHER
I really don’t have any I’m sorry

WOMAN
Okay

An awkward pause

WOMAN
You’re not thirsty

She nods towards the lemonade

MOTHER
Right

Mother steps down picks up her glass and takes a sip

MOTHER
Now I get it Strong

WOMAN
I’m on my second I can’t believe
you did all this work yourself

MOTHER
Why not

WOMAN
It’s a lot

MOTHER

Well we spend all our time here
I want to make it paradise And I
love the work

WOMAN
And it’s exquisite

MOTHER
Thank you

WOMAN

Would you take me on a tour

MOTHER
Sure

Mother starts to lead her away but the woman grabs her
shoulder

WOMAN
I want to thank you for your
hospitality Your husband has been
so generous

MOTHER
(after a pause)
You’re welcome

After another awkward pause

WOMAN
Well where to begin

Mother follows her into the

STAIRWELL
And points up towards the skylight

MOTHER
Well this was probably the hardest
part There was so much damage
The treads were gone the railing
even the skylight So I had to get
a lot of new material but I tried
to save as much--

WOMAN
Isn’t that a lot harder than just
starting fresh

MOTHER
How do you mean

WOMAN
Well why didn’t you just build a
new house

MOTHER
It’s his home

WOMAN
You really love him

Mother blushes

WOMAN
Can I ask you a question

Mother doesn’t trust what’s coming
WOMAN
(fishing)
Why don’t you want kids

MOTHER
Excuse me

WOMAN
I saw how you reacted earlier I
know what’s it’s like when you’re
just starting out and you think you
have all the time in the world
But you know you’re not going to
be so young forever Have kids
Then you’ll be creating something
together that’s what keeps a
Marriage going

(motions to house)

This is all just setting

Mother’s guard slips She chokes up a little
WOMAN

(almost to herself)
Oh you do want them Is it him

MOTHER
I need to get back to work

WOMAN
Then why did he say I’m sorry
Was I too forward I do that

sometimes

(trying apologetic)
Every relationship has its issues
and when there’s a full generation
between you I can only imagine

Mother doesn’t know what to say The tipsy woman gets
distracted by a glimpse of the study up the stairs

WOMAN
Is that where he works
MOTHER
That’s private
WOMAN
(mischievous )

Oh can’t you just give me a peek

Woman doesn’t pay her any mind and keeps heading for the
study Mother grabs her arm

MOTHER
(too strong)
He doesn’t like anyone being in
there without him

Woman looks at the tight grip

WOMAN
Wow you really do love him God
help you

They are interrupted by laughing HIM and Man emerge from
the guest bedroom

MOTHER
Where are you going

HIM
I’m going to take him outside

MAN
Going on a hike

MOTHER
A hike

MAN

(smiles at Woman)
Me on a hike

HIM
Just a quick one

WOMAN
Go slow

MAN

Slow enough so my smoke doesn’t
burn too quickly

(encourages against it)
You don’t want to come

Still Mother lights up but

WOMAN
No we have laundry to do
(to Mother)

Youll show me where right

There’s an awkward pause In the

BASEMENT
Mother and Woman walk down the stairs

WOMAN
The boys have bonded don’t you
think Mine’s not usually such a
nature boy
(sees the unfinished room)
Wow guess you haven’t quite gotten
to this part yet

She carries a bag of dirty clothes It’s heavy and she drops
it

WOMAN
So heavy
(noticing)
That’s a lot of tools

MOTHER
Ill get it

Mother lifts the bag up and carries it to the washer and
dryer The woman follows

WOMAN
Which is which

MOTHER
On the left

Woman opens the loaded washing machine and dumps out Mother’s
wet clothes onto the floor

MOTHER
Wait let me I’11 help you

Mother starts to load the wet clothes into the dryer Woman
stops aghast

WOMAN
Oh no So that’s the problem

MOTHER
What

Woman holds up a pair of Mother’s very boring panties
WOMAN
Youre going to have to try harder

than this

Mother yanks them away

WOMAN
Believe me when they get older
you gotta keep it interesting

She laughs as she shows her own panties in the dirty pile
Very sexy

MOTHER
He’s not that old

WOMAN
How’s it going in that department

MOTHER
I don’t feel comfortable talking
about that stuff

WOMAN
I’m just trying to help I mean
look at you If he’s not all over
you it’s either because of his
age OY

She drifts off

MOTHER
Or what

WOMAN
(switches course)
You know what forget it It’s
none of my business I think this
has gone to my head

She motions to the lemonade

MOTHER
No It’s okay Say what you were
going to say

WOMAN
No seriously Obviously he still
loves you

She gulps down the rest of her lemonade She grabs Mother’s
mostly untouched glass

WOMAN
I’m going to freshen these up

Woman leaves She never started the wash

Mother sees the woman’s panties hanging half out of the
washer She tosses them behind the machines and starts the
wash

She looks at her dirty hands Goes and washes them in the
slop sink

She looks at the wall that scared her earlier In the

KITCHEN

The woman is not there But she’s made a huge mess making
the lemonade Mother sighs She walks towards the

GUEST BEDROOM

But it’s empty

MOTHER
Hello

No answer She hears water running in the bathroom She
moves to turn it off

But trips on something She looks down and finds the man’s
open tote bag in the middle of the floor

She flips the light on in the

GUEST BATHROOM

And turns off the water There are tissues sprayed with
blood on the sink

She picks them up with her fingertips and drops them in the
toilet

She flushes the toilet She washes her hands and notices the
toilet is clogged The toilet water rises towards the rim

Quickly she grabs the plunger

She jabs it into the bowl Just in time the water starts to
recede

But she notices something poking out from the bottom of the
bowl Something she’s never seen before It is a fleshy
bony mass

She uses the wooden end of the plunger to prod it It opens
up revealing blood pus and ribs Before she gets a clear
look it is sucked down the drain

She stumbles away and drops the plunger

Her breath starts to tighten Her chest hurts She stumbles
back into the

GUEST BEDROOM

And trips on the tote bag again The bump causes something
to shift Under a sweater is a CEREMONIAL PHOTO of HIM with
a decorative frame

Disturbed she stumbles out into the

FOYER
Just in time to see Woman walking up the stairs

MOTHER
Hey

Woman enters the

STUDY
Where she stares at the crystal
MOTHER
I told you he doesn’t like anyone

being in here without him

WOMAN
It’s amazing What is it

Mother gets between the woman and the crystal Woman pushes
towards it Mother has to hold her back

MOTHER
(getting anxious)
We really need to leave Please

Mother guides her out of the study

WOMAN
I just want to look at it

MOTHER
You have to go

WOMAN
I don’t know why you have to make
such a big deal out of it

Mother pulls the study door shut as the front door opens
Man enters in the midst of a coughing fit

WOMAN
Oh they’re back

HIM
This way I’ll get you some water

Woman concerned rushes down to intervene

WOMAN
Honey Are you all right Your
damn smoking

In the

PANTRY
HIM offers Man a glass of water

HIM
Here

Man nods

WOMAN
You all right

HIM
(re cough)
Just started

WOMAN
Come on let’s go get you your
pills Look if I wanted a third
child

She pulls her husband through the kitchen into their bedroom
Mother is not happy

HIM
(to Mother)
That was intense You’re not going
to believe what he just told me--

Mother ignores him She sees him leaning on the sink

MOTHER
That sink’s not braced yet

HIM
What Is something

She doesn’t stay to listen Rudely she turns and walks into
the

STATRWELL
He chases her down

HIM
Hey wait something happened
What What is it

She pulls him to a more private spot in the

DINING ROOM
Whispering she says

MOTHER
He has one of those pictures of you
in his luggage

HIM
What were you doing in their
luggage

MOTHER
That’s not the point He didn’t
just “stumble” on us He’s a crazy
fan

HIM
I know

MOTHER
Excuse me

HIM
That’s what he told me on our walk
He’s dying That’s why he came
here He wanted to meet me before
he’s gone

That gives her pause

MOTHER
Why didn’t he tell us that Why
lie

HIM

I don’t know He’s a proud man I
admire that

Just then right above them they hear a crash HIM’s face
goes slack He runs up to the

STUDY

Mother on his heels Woman is in the corner guilty Man
stands in front of her scared

HIM
What have you done

MAN
I’m so sorry We’re both sorry

HIM falls to his knees looking at the remains of his special
crystal formation Mother can tell he’s devastated

MAN

I was telling her the story when--
WOMAN

It just fell out of my hands

and
HIM holds up his hand telling them to stop They don’t

MAN
Well search and find another--

WOMAN
We can pay for a new one--

HIM
(explodes )
QUIET
His outburst startles them It startles Mother as well
They quiet down immediately HIM points to the door
Man leads Woman out Heads bowed they file past Mother

HIM carefully picks up all the different shards He collects
them into a small delicate bowl

He looks over at Mother

HIM
I’m sorry I screamed I just need
a moment

She nods ever so slightly and heads out to the

HALF LANDING
The couple watches from the bottom of the stairs

MAN
It was an accident

MOTHER
I think it’s best if you leave

WOMAN
We said we were sorry

MAN
(whispering)
Honey don’t antagonize--

WOMAN
(under her breath)
What more do you want

Mother stares at them The man gets it and they retreat
towards the guest bedroom

In the study HIM finishes collecting the shards Then he
sticks his hands into the bowl into the glass Slowly he
makes two tight fists

Glass cuts into his hands Mother GASPS He turns and sees
her

HIM
Please Please

She shuts the door Her breath tightens Her sternum hurts
She tears up She fights to take a breath She marches down
to the

GUEST BEDROOM

The door is open a crack She peeks in Man and Woman are
making out hard

Things are heated Mother stares Man has his hands down
Woman’s panties and fingers her She catches Mother’s eyes
and maybe grins Naughty

Mother spins away Her chest tightens more The house
shifts slightly her reality on fire She charges up to the
MASTER BATHROOM

And drinks some yellow powdered tincture Its glow calms
her She heads down to the

HALF LANDING

She knocks No answer Then she hears footsteps approach
HIM slips out of the study and shuts the door

With his bloody fist he SMASHES the door knob off
Frightened she watches him walk upstairs The knob rolls
through the spindles and slams into the ground floor She
follows it down to the

STAIRWELL

She picks it up and places it onto the hallway bureau She
stands there confused Then she makes a decision She
heads down into the

BASEMENT
She grabs the laundry bag and throws the unwelcome guests’

wet clothes into it She takes the garbage bag of clothes
back upstairs to the

STAIRWELL

She hears it first then sees HIM in front of his study
nailing plywood over the study door

MOTHER
What are you doing

He keeps hammering nails into the wall

MOTHER
What are you doing

He turns and looks down on her

HIM

They will never get in here again
MOTHER

Well don’t worry I’m kicking them

out
He grins a slight ambiguous grin

HIM
Where will they go

Odd comment She doesn’t understand it He turns and
continues nailing the new wall

Frustrated she bangs on the door to the

GUEST BEDROOM
Wearing just a bra Woman stands in the doorway

WOMAN
Need something

Man is in the bathroom having a coughing fit
Beat

MOTHER
Are you ready

WOMAN
What do you mean

MOTHER
We want you out

WOMAN
We Or you

MOTHER
I’ve tried very hard--

WOMAN
(interrupting)
Yeah well look I have to check on
my husband

Woman shuts the door in her face Mother knocks on the door
She tries the knob It’s locked Pissed and confused
Then someone is in the foyer

YOUNGER BROTHER (0S)
Hello Hello where is everybody

Mother startles turns A silver-tongued neer-do-well Man
and Woman’s second child the YOUNGER BROTHER pushes into the

FOYER

Mother approaches him She looks for HIM but he is no longer
on the half landing

YOUNGER BROTHER
(taken with Mother’s
beauty)
Oh hey Hey who’re you

MOTHER

The stranger gets a little too close

YOUNGER BROTHER
(hides a smile)
What are any of us doing here

(she doesn’t bite)
Where’s my mother

She realizes who he is

MOTHER
Oh Wait here

Mother heads towards the guest bedroom He follows behind
Checks out her rear

YOUNGER BROTHER
Hey Nice view

Mother doesn’t appreciate it Just then Woman emerges

MOTHER
Did you invite your son--

But before Mother can finish the son rushes into the woman’s
arms

WOMAN

YOUNGER BROTHER

WOMAN
What’s wrong

YOUNGER BROTHER

He came to the house and found the

Mother is frustrated Still trying to get them out

MOTHER

But they ignore her A new voice pulls her back

OLDEST SON (0S)
(interrupting screams)
Daaad-- DAAAAAAAAAAAD--

WOMAN

YOUNGER BROTHER
Oh no

WOMAN

Mother sees fear flash across the younger brother and the

woman’s faces

MOTHER
Who’s that

The OLDEST SON rushes toward his family

Ragged and

disturbed he sees his mom and brother conspiring together

OLDEST SON
(can barely contain his
resentment)
Ran straight to mommy

YOUNGER BROTHER

WOMAN

The younger brother physically blocks his brother Their
arrives from the bedroom

MAN

Woman rushes to her husband’s side The oldest son whips
thick will out of his pocket and waves it

OLDEST SON
(to Man)
What is this Do you know what you
signed
MAN

Of course I do
As the brothers jostle Man and Woman start to bicker

WOMAN
Go lie back down I’11 handle it

MAN
You said that you told him

WOMAN
No honey I didn’t say that

Mother is stuck in the middle of the madness Fear creeps
into her heart as she tries but can’t get away

dad

OLDEST SON
(devastated to his
father)

You wanted this How could you

MAN
It’s for a good reason son

YOUNGER BROTHER
It’s you It’s not him

Man tries to ease away from his wife who is trying to
dissuade him

WOMAN
Let me talk to him

MAN
No I’1l talk to him

And Man pushes through to his eldest and holds him

MAN
You’re right I should have told
you myself Okay And I’m sorry
I was thinking about you About
what’s best for all of you

He leads his older son into the drawing room the others
follow Mother can finally get past hurries to the

STAIRWELL

She looks up for HIM but he’s nowhere to be seen Behind
her in the drawing room the family continues to fight

MAN
It’s a trust You have to make a
decision as a group before anything
can be spent

OLDEST SON
It won’t work I have to get
permission from them every time I
take a piss

MAN
It will force you to talk To get
along That’s the most important
thing

OLDEST SON
She will side with him every time

MAN
You’re not even listening to me

WOMAN
I just want to support you both

OLDEST SON

Support me You just want to tell
me what I can and can’t do

WOMAN
That is not fair

A door SLAMS above Mother looks up once more and sees HIM
watching from three flights up Mother runs up the

STAIRS
As the family continues to argue downstairs

OLDEST SON
You never believe in me or
anything I’m trying to do

YOUNGER BROTHER
Stop whining

OLDEST SON
See Don’t do this Dad they hate
me

MAN

Come on They don’t hate you

WOMAN
We love you You’re our son

OLDEST SON
Well then treat me like one

YOUNGER BROTHER
First act like one

Mother glances down at the family as HIM meets her at the

HALF LANDING
With two buckets of paint He puts them down
MOTHER

The sons are here They just
barged in I couldn’t stop them

HIM
I know
She follows HIM down the stairs
MAN
There’s more than enough for

everyone to share

YOUNGER BROTHER
If you don’t waste it all

OLDEST SON
Shut up

YOUNGER BROTHER
Here we go again Losing your
temper when you don’t get your way

Now Man sees his hosts arrive at the

BOTTOM OF THE STEPS

And he lowers his voice embarrassed

MAN

Let’s discuss this outside
OLDEST SON

No I want to talk about it now
MAN

Our hosts--
SON

Shut up
MAN

(trying to quiet him)
If you need money I’11 give you

Man pulls out his wallet

OLDEST SON
I don’t want your chump change

The older son slaps the wallet onto the ground Woman tries
to calm him down

WOMAN
Sweetie

OLDEST SON
Don’t touch me

The older son roughly shoves his mom aside At that HIM
lunges forward and pins the oldest son against the wall

HIM
Calm down

OLDEST SON
(recognizes him)
Youre the poet The great writer
(serious now)
You don’t know anything

HIM
Maybe so

OLDEST SON
They lied to me They’re robbing
me

HIM

I don’t know the story Will you

The older son hears the words

HIM
Will you

The older son nods and HIM lets go

MAN
Thank you

HIM motions towards the drawing room

HIM
You can sit in there

Mother looks at HIM alarmed
MAN
Good Now let’s go sit down and
discuss this
YOUNGER BROTHER
No Mom Dad’s dying and all he

cares about is his damn money

The older son leaps on his brother It explodes quickly

WOMAN
Stop it

MAN
Boys stop it

Man tries to pull his sons apart The oldest elbows him in
the guts

He goes down coughing up blood struggling to breathe HIM
rushes to his new friend’s side

YOUNGER BROTHER
Look at Dad look what you did

The younger rushes the older and shoves him into the wall
Murder in his eyes he tosses his younger brother onto the
floor

MOTHER
Stop

WOMAN
Boys Stop it
Man coughs uncontrollably He can’t catch his breath The
younger brother spits on his brother and flees The oldest
son throws a chair at him but misses It smashes into the
wall

MOTHER
Please NO

HIM
Can you breathe Breathe

The older son lunges after his baby brother who flees past
Mother She pursues them through the
STAIRWELL

The pursuing oldest son grabs the door knob Mother left on
the bureau

MOTHER
Stop

She follows them into the

GUEST BEDROOM

The oldest son raises the door knob above his head and bashes
the younger brother’s head in

MOTHER
Wait Stop Stop it

Mother SCREAMS She tries to break it up She gets shoved
and crashes onto her back against a bureau

The young boy has collapsed on the ground blood rushes out
from his head

OLDEST SON
Get up Get up Get up Stop
faking Look at me

Mother gasps The oldest son looks at her She tries to
back away He grabs her ankle and pins her against the
bureau

OLDEST SON
It’s not my fault They never
really loved me They always loved
him more They were leaving me
behind

Mother tries to get away

OLDEST SON
Just tell me you understand You
have to understand

Mother does understand The oldest son relaxes when from
nowhere HIM lifts the oldest son off the ground and SLAMS
his head into a glass vase on the mantle

The eldest son barely stays on his feet bleeding from a GASH
in his forehead

HIM
What have you done to your
brother

Woman rushes in

WOMAN
What did you do What did you do

The oldest son stumbles out of the room nearly knocking into
his mom

OLDEST SON
(as he leaves)
You did this
Woman sees her bleeding younger son and screams
WOMAN
Wake up
(to HIM)
Do something help him
She rushes to her son HIM kneels next to the boy
HIM
(to Mother)
Towels Towels

Mother goes for the towels in the

GUEST BATHROOM

The back door slams open She sees the oldest son stumble
out onto the porch and head towards the east

Mother grabs towels and rushes back into the

GUEST BEDROOM

The younger brother is losing blood fast His eyes stare off
into the darkness

YOUNGER BROTHER
Father Father--

HIM
(interrupts )
The doctor go get him

Mother rushes to the

FOYER
Man is just getting to his feet

MOTHER
Come quick He’s bleeding

MAN
What What’s happening

MOTHER
He’s bleeding
HIM enters the room carrying the bleeding boy

WOMAN
It’s bad Really bad

MAN

HIM
He’s not waking up

Man examines his son on the move

WOMAN
Careful don’t drop him

MAN
Keep his head up

HIM looks at Mother as he moves

HIM
I’1l call you from the hospital

MOTHER
No no please stay with me

MAN
Please we need him

HIM
Lock the doors I’1ll be back as
soon as I can

MOTHER
Please don’t leave me

HIM just looks at Mother doesn’t say anything and leaves the
house leaving her alone

The sun hangs low in the sky

OUTSIDE

We see the entire home Mother alone on the porch It’s the
first time we’ve seen the exterior Back at the

FOYER

Mother shuts the door She locks it There’s blood on the
handle

Mother goes to the

BACK DOOR

And locks it She looks at her hand It’s bloody She
looks at the empty house As night sets in the

KITCHEN

Mother stares at the disappearing woods An INSECT knocks
against the window trying to get out It dies on the ledge
just an inch from freedom Now in the

GUEST BEDROOM

She ties back her hair as she stares at the bloody floor
Later wearing dish gloves she mops up the blood with rags
There’s still a stain She’ll need clean water She dumps
the rags into a bucket She carries the bucket into the
GUEST BATHROOM

Where she empties the bucket in the tub and starts refilling
it with hot water She pulls off a glove wipes her brow
She touches the wall closes her eyes slips into the
DARKNESS OF HER IMAGINATION

She feels the house her hands her feet The sound of the
running faucet fades away She feels the house the house
feels her She is all of it and she feels it shrinking away
This alarms her She opens her eyes back in the

GUEST BATHROOM

Mother turns off the tap She moves deliberately into the

GUEST BEDROOM

Goes to the bloody floor She touches it The wood is
rotten crumples apart She grabs a lamp and shines it into
the hole

She sees something She opens the hole a bit bigger and sees
blood pooled on the back of the basement ceiling

She heads down into the

BASEMENT

She flips on the light Blood fills up the bare bulb and it
bursts Total darkness

She’s prepared There’s a flashlight on a nearby ledge
She flips it on Blood drips from the ceiling

A blood stain stretches out from the hole and travels down
the wall behind the boiler The same wall she heard noises

from

The blood forms the outline of a rounded portal the
mysterious wall

She grabs a WRENCH and moves to the blood stain

She uses the wrench to test the edges of the door-shape
formed by the stain They are rotten She pushes on it It
starts to move The whole stone piece the shape of a
tombstone opens to reveal a

HIDDEN CELLAR

A gust of wind blows out Some dust comes with it

She peers into the dark room

Inside is the huge oil tank for the house

And then a lone TOAD hops out from the darkness It hops
towards her She slides out of the way as it hops into the
basement and under the boiler

She looks under the boiler It’s gone Strange

Then she hears GLASS BREAK upstairs Scared she listens in
silence There are footsteps

Clutching the wrench she heads upstairs to the

HALLWAY

Nothing moves She peers into the

KITCHEN

Still nothing Then she notices the

BACK DOOR

Is open She sneaks towards the pantry to get a better view
Broken glass from a broken pane on the floor The ceremonial
photo of HIM’s face ripped into pieces

Footsteps CREAK behind her She turns to the

FOYER

And reveal the oldest son watching her She YELPS He looks
at her

OLDEST SON
They left you all alone You do
understand

He picks up his dad’s wallet walks out the front door and
disappears into darkness

OLDEST SON
Good luck

After a beat she runs to the

KITCHEN
To call the police
911 (ON PHONE)
911 what’s your emergency What’s
your emergency
The back door is open She spins It’s HIM out of breath
She runs into his arms in the

PANTRY

He looks at her
HIM
Are you all right

MOTHER
He was here

HIM
I know The police brought me
home They’1ll find him don’t
worry Did he hurt you
He hugs her They take a few breaths

MOTHER
No

HIM
No Okay sit Let me get you
some water

He goes into the

KITCHEN
Brings back the water

HIM
Here It’s okay It’s all right

MOTHER
What happened at the hospital

HIM
I was holding the boy’s hand when
he died

MOTHER

That’s awful Are you all right

HIM
I’m exhausted

He looks at his bloody shirt
HIM
I need a hot shower Will you

come

She follows him down the

HALLWAY

But when she passes the

GUEST BEDROOM
She pauses

HIM
What is it

MOTHER

I‘1l be up in a minute
HIM

You sure
MOTHER

Yeah

Mother goes to the bloody hole in the floor She pulls a
carpet over it covering the bloody stain

By the time she gets up to the

MASTER BEDROOM

HIM wrapped in a wet towel is out cold on the bed

LATER

She sleeps A distant door SLAMS It wakes her and she sits
up What was that HIM is fast asleep next to her

She hears VOICES downstairs From the

SECOND FLOOR LANDING

Three STRANGERS in black pass under her Two females and one
male

Nervous she starts to head back for help when she spots Man
and Woman enter He is distraught and leans heavily on the
MOURNER

MOURNER
In here

WOMAN
Yeah straight ahead in the
kitchen

Mother rushes back to the

MASTER BEDROOM
But the bed is empty

She turns HIM emerges from the bathroom belt open shirt
just being put on

HIM
They came back quick

MOTHER
What are they doing here

HIM
They had nowhere to go so I told
them it would be all right to
invite some friends and family
I’1l go deal with them

As he leaves tucking in his shirt her breath starts to
thin She feels a pain in her chest She swallows the pain
and follows him down the stairs into the
DINING ROOM
HIM holds Woman She’s stoic and numb
HIM
I’m so sorry I’m so sorry for

your loss

Meanwhile Man is hysterical The Mourner helps him to a
chair

Woman glances at Mother

MOTHER
I’m so sorry

Woman turns and goes to her husband HIM puts his hands on
the man’s shoulder

A friend the CUPBEARER starts pouring shots

CUPBEARER
Shall we have a toast

Man just cries

WOMAN
(whispers to HIM)
Would you say something He so
respects you

HIM
Of course

HIM nods as the Cupbearer distributes glasses He hands one
to Mother

HIM
How can one begin to understand
your pain The sacrifice of a
parent All those years of worry
Years in days Days in hours
Hours in seconds But in each
second an infinite amount of love

Woman rubs her husband’s shoulders

HIM
And now suddenly it seems there is
nothing to love Just a vast and
silent darkness But fear not
from inside it there’s a voice
crying out to be heard loud and
strong Just listen

And for a moment everyone is silent Then Man starts to cry
So do the mourners In a moment everyone is crying

HIM
Do you hear that Do you hear
that That is the sound of life
that is the sound of humanity
That is your son’s voice His cry
of love His love for you

Woman takes HIM’s arm

WOMAN
Thank you

HIM
My pleasure

CUPBEARER
Here Here

EVERYONE
HERE HERE

Everyone shoots The Cupbearer looks at Mother who still
holds her drink She follows through and downs the drink

WOMAN
Thank you all for coming here and
being with us tonight My husband
and I are so touched We lost our
baby today I can’t believe that
just a few hours ago he was
standing there and I was holding
him in my arms He was so full of
life He always was

There’s a knock at the door Mother looks at HIM He nods
to her She goes to the

FRONT DOOR

SIX GRIEVERS file in They say hello and Mother welcomes
them They shed jackets and Mother hangs them before joining
everyone in the

DINING ROOM

Woman continues her toast She glances through Mother with
empty eyes

WOMAN
It means so much I don’t know
what else to say I just want to
thank our dear host for his
hospitality in our time of need

HIM
Of course

WOMAN
(to HIM)
So please Id like to drink to
your kindness

Everyone raises glasses and drinks Man stands up

WOMAN
Sweetheart you don’t have to do
this

MAN

No I want to

He collects himself

MAN
I loved my son I loved him I
can’t believe this I shouldn’t be
eulogizing him he should--

And he breaks down unable to continue Everyone quietly
drinks Mother sips

MAN
I’m sorry I can’t Would someone
please
(to Mother)
Would you say something

Everyone turns to look at Mother Mother doesn’t know what
to say After a long awkward beat

MOTHER
(meek)
For your child

HIM helps out

HIM
For both your children Let’s not
forget the one still in the
wilderness Wherever he goes
wherever he is may he find
kindness compassion and one day
even forgiveness

The front door opens Mother looks Another five people
enter including the PHILANDERER

HIM
Welcome please join us

PHILANDERER
I’m just gonna put this in the
kitchen

HIM

Yes through there
Mother looks on in disbelief Concerned she follows the
Philanderer into the
PANTRY
The room is half full with people drinking and talking The

Philanderer joins the CONSOLER who is sitting on the counter
next to the sink

PHILANDERER
Hey how you doing

CONSOLER
Good considering

MOTHER
Excuse me Could you get down from
there That sink’s not braced yet
They nod and get down apologizing

Someone steps on the glass pane from the broken back door
Mother quickly sweeps it up

The Cupbearer enters

CUPBEARER
That was so beautiful no

He hugs her Mother is taken aback

CUPBEARER
It’s all right Can I use your
phone

MOTHER

Sure it’s in the kitchen
She sees him head the wrong way

MOTHER
No it’s just there Excuse me

But he’s not listening She follows after him into the

DINING ROOM
Woman pops up right next to Mother She’s smoking

WOMAN
Where did you go

MOTHER
I was just in the I’m really
sorry again

WOMAN
I know you are

It’s loaded Mother tries to change the subject

MOTHER
I can’t imagine how--

WOMAN
No You can’t imagine what it
feels like if you don’t have a
child You give and you give and
you give and it’s just never
enough

MOTHER
I understand

WOMAN
Do you
(lashes out)
Why don’t you at least put on
something decent
Mother realizes she’s wearing a night gown Embarrassed she
exits to the foyer where the pain in her chest starts again
She sees more guests arriving rushes up the

STAIRS

And sees the Cupbearer grab the DAMSEL and duck into the

MASTER BEDROOM

MOTHER
Hey

Mother pushes inside And finds them sitting on her bed

MOTHER
You can’t be in here

CUPBEARER
I’m sorry

MOTHER
You need to leave

CUPBEARER
We’1ll just be a minute

MOTHER
This is our room

That makes him smile But he backs away and exits

CUPBEARER
It’s your room
(to Damsel)
Come on let’s find another spot

Mother shuts the door

Her chest tightens more She fights for breath She goes
into the

MASTER BATHROOM

At the medicine cabinet she drinks some yellow powder Ina
moment she feels better

She starts to change her clothes The WANDERER pushes open
the door

WANDERER
Oh
MOTHER
(embarrassed)
Excuse me
WANDERER

Just exploring
He ducks out but doesn’t shut the door She gets up and
shuts it Later in the
MASTER BEDROOM

She’s finished getting dressed and exits into the

HALLWAY
Where the IDLER and the STRAGGLER talk on the stairs
MOTHER
Excuse me could you please go

downstairs

STRAGGLER
This way

MOTHER
Yes

IDLER
Sure

She follows them down past the

HALF LANDING

The boards that HIM used to seal the office are now painted
white

Curious Mother touches the wood It’s still wet She gets
paint on her hand Quickly now she rushes down the

STAIRWELL

Where the Cupbearer uses a roller on a stick to paint the
bottom side of the stairs

MOTHER
What are you doing

CUPBEARER
Oh it’s no big deal I worked my
way through college doing this

MOTHER
But why are you painting my house

The comment makes him smile
CUPBEARER
Well he’s been so kind to
everyone it’s the least we could
do

We She turns around and sees the Damsel painting in the
drawing room

MOTHER
Stop Both of you Stop

They look at her strangely

CUPBEARER
No problem

They put down their brushes Frustrated she moves quickly
into the

DINING ROOM

Where HIM holds court He’s with a room full of people

smoking and drinking He bangs on the table animated and
filled with excitement

HIM
Of course what’s mine is yours
(spots her)
There you are My goddess Come
here sit You’ve got to hear
these stories They are--

She pushes through the crowd to HIM

MOTHER
All these people

HIM
I know They’re just letting off
steam

MOTHER

They’re painting our house

The drunk ATTENDANT laughs HYSTERICALLY He falls back in
his chair and knocks over a glass spilling wine everywhere

MOTHER
I got it

Mother grabs napkins mops up the spill She weaves between
guests with the sopping towel into the

PANTRY
Where the PHILANDERER and the FOOL sit on the sink

MOTHER
Please get down from there

FOOL
Sorry Excuse me

And they do Then whisper quietly about Mother

PHILANDERER
What’s her problem

FOOL
I don’t know

Mother tosses the napkins into the sink She grabs the
overflowing trash towards the kitchen But she’s cut-off by
the suave ADULTERER

ADULTERER
Hey we haven’t met I’ve known the
family for years And you

MOTHER
This is my house

That gets a smile out of the Adulterer He looks at Mother
in a strange way like she’s insane

ADULTERER
Well it’s a beautiful home You
want to take a walk

MOTHER
What

ADULTERER
A walk With me

MOTHER
No No

She spots the Philanderer and Fool back up on the sink

MOTHER
Please--

ADULTERER
You know what take my number

Mother turns back towards the Adulterer

MOTHER
No I don’t want your number

ADULTERER
Now why would you say that You
don’t even know me
(takes out his phone)
Let me give me your number

She presses for the kitchen The Adulterer grabs her arm

MOTHER
Let go of me

ADULTERER
Why

MOTHER

Because I don’t know you
(to the people on the
sink)
Get down from there

PHILANDERER
From where

ADULTERER
But you see you should because you
don’t know what I can do for you

MOTHER

I don’t want anything from you
ADULTERER

Sassy
MOTHER

Leave me alone
ADULTERER
You know what get out of my face
You’re an arrogant cunt
She’s stunned by his words and shoots him an angry look
Mother turns back towards the sink where the sink-sitters
have started to bounce on the counter It holds

FOOL
See there’s nothing wrong with it

PHILANDERER
It’s really okay

They keep bouncing
MOTHER
No stop doing that Don’t do that
Stop
Then there’s a loud CRACK and the sink fully collapses

The pipes in the wall behind the sink rip through the wall
Bigger mains in the ceiling collapse through

Water sprays down on everyone The crowd screams Mother
snaps

MOTHER
Get OUT GET OUT All of you

People start to head towards the door
HIM soaked rushes in against traffic

HIM
What happened

Mother can barely answer

MOTHER
They won’t listen
HIM
It’s all right we’ll fix it it can
be fixed
He turns from her to try and stop everybody from leaving--
HIM
(finds Man grabs his
shoulder)
Please don’t go Don’t go We’1l
turn it off
MAN
It’s been an honor And we’1ll
never forget all you’ve done for
us

HIM
Where will you go

Man pulls away from HIM Woman gives Mother one last look
before leaving her home Mother shakes her head as she gets
soaked by the spraying water She rushes down to the
BASEMENT

Mother finds the water main Turns it off

In the dark quiet she hears footsteps of the crowd leaving
The front door slams shut Quiet at last

Then she heads back upstairs to the

STAIRWELL

The front door is closed The dining room and kitchen are
trashed

No sign of HIM She heads into the

KITCHEN
She starts to clean HIM enters shoulders sunk

HIM
They’re gone

She ignores him
HIM
Come let’s go to bed

She continues to clean

HIM
You don’t need to--

MOTHER
Do what Clean up their mess

HIM
We did a good thing They needed a
place to celebrate life They
needed tonight

MOTHER
What about what I needed A boy
died here today I mopped up his
blood And you abandoned me

She storms away into the

STATRWELL
He follows her

HIM
No I didn’t abandon you They
just lost a son they lost two
sons I was helping them This is
not about us it’s about them

She spins

MOTHER
No it’s not about them it’s about
you It’s always about you and
your work You think that’s gonna
help you write Nothing does I
re-built this entire house wall to
wall you haven’t written a word

HIM
(snaps bellowing)
I know I know I’m sorry I
can’t I can’t write I can’t
think All I’m trying to do is
bring life into this house

He charges to the front door and flings it open
HIM

Open the door to new people
ideas You think you can’t
breathe I’m the one whos
suffocating here While you
pretend that nothing is wrong

(mocking)
“Everything will be
“Everything will be
be fine” You know
doesn’t always work
want it to

good”
what

MOTHER
Youre right Mine certainly
didn’t

HIM

Excuse me

MOTHER

New

all right”
“Youll

Life

out the way you

You talk about wanting kids but

you can’t even fuck me

She rushes away from him up the

STAIRS

A flash of anger bursts through HIM He
tries to kiss her She fights him off

Slowly she stops fighting Instead she
She

They kiss hard Real fucking hard

devours her

He lifts her off of her feet and carries
Raindrops splatter on the skylight And
into

WHITE
In the morning she wakes Blissful
holding her side

She is content Fully present

She takes a deep breath That makes her
something
She takes a DEEP breath She smiles
Takes another breath
floods her

grabs her hard and
He keeps at it
grabs him

devours him He

her up the stairs
everything dissolves

He lies next to her

curious She feels

No actually she feels the ABSENCE of something

Touches her chest
She realizes something

Happiness

MOTHER
I’m pregnant

She turns to HIM

MOTHER
I’m pregnant

HIM
Huh

MOTHER

Were going to have a baby
He chuckles

MOTHER
I’m serious

HIM
(sobering)
How could you know

MOTHER
Because I know

She looks deep into his eyes He looks back

MOTHER
I’m pregnant

She starts to cry Tears of happiness He believes her
Tears well up in his eyes and he hugs her

HIM
A baby

MOTHER
Are you happy

HIM
Happy The most beautiful gift

And then he is lost in a thought

MOTHER
What

He flies out of bed naked and rushes for the desk He
ransacks it for a piece of paper Finally finds a scrap
But there’s no pen he dumps the drawer

HIM
Pen Pen Pen

Then he practically rolls down the stairs Mother
confused follows after him She finds him in the

DRAWING ROOM
On his ass leaning over the coffee table scribbling away

MOTHER
What are you doing

He looks up as if from a dream

HIM
(obviously)
I’m writing

MOTHER
What

HIM

Writing Last night Those
people their pain Their love
behind the pain And then you
Us And now that

(he points at her belly)
Life

(nods to himself)
It’s come to me I know what to
say I have to find the words
That’s all

She smiles Happy to see him inspired
MOTHER
Amazing I don’t want to interrupt
I’1l just get started on the
apocalypse
She turns to leave HIM looks up

HIM
Hey I love you

She smiles Turns to look at the mess and sighs Later in
the

MASTER BATHROOM

Mother stands before the toilet She holds the yellow

tincture in her hand She dumps it all into the bowl and
flushes it

She exits the frame for the first time because now it is

FIVE MONTHS LATER

Mother five months pregnant and showing steps into the
guest bedroom which has been converted into a

NURSERY

She moves through the room putting away diaper cloths and
other baby paraphernalia

Her eyes are drawn to the floor where the rotten wood has
been replaced with a patch of new unstained boards After a
beat she covers it with the carpet

She sneaks a peak into the drawing room where HIM writes at
a makeshift desk deep in concentration The walls around
him are covered with calligraphy sketches and ideas The
doorknob is on his desk She retreats through the

GUEST BATHROOM
Which has been painted and converted into a baby’s bathroom
Then she enters the

KITCHEN

She opens the fridge to make a sandwich when she feels the
baby kick She yelps with surprise

She pulls up her shirt The baby elbows the inside of her
FIVE MONTH belly Her eyes go wide

MOTHER
(to herself)
It moved
(to HIM)
It moved

She rushes to the

STAIRWELL

To tell HIM but the drawing room is empty Then she spots
him standing in the

OPEN DOORWAY
Staring into the wilderness outside

MOTHER
What is it

He turns and sees her A look she’s never seen before is on
his face Her happiness turns into concern

Slowly he looks down at his hands She follows his eyes In
his hand is a page with words the poem

MOTHER
(she knows)
Is that it

She steps towards him in the

FOYER
He barely believes it himself

HIM
I finished it

MOTHER
May I

He hands the poem to Mother A single sheet of paper

She sits on the

STAIRS

She gives him one last look and reads Slowly as the words
enter her we see images from

OUTSIDE

HIM alone He stands in a desolated field with the remnants
of his burnt home

He reaches for someone Mother emerges and takes his hand
They are younger and newly in love

She is smitten with him And he with her

As they clasp hands the charred ground and the burnt house
begin to rejuvenate with new life
Back to Mother on the

STAIRS
She starts to cry

MOTHER
It’s beautiful

He holds her

HIM
Really Why are you crying

MOTHER
It’s just a lot

HIM
You think it’s good

MOTHER
It’s perfect

HIM
Then What’s going on

She can barely ask

MOTHER
Am I going to lose you

HIM
(very serious)
Never--
And then the phone RINGS The phone

He goes to answer it She’s left alone with the poem

HIM
Hello Hi

She wipes her tears and follows him into the

KITCHEN
He is excited and on the phone

HIM (ON PHONE)
Yes Really Really

MOTHER
Who is that

HIM (INTO PHONE)
Wait one moment give me a
second

(to Mother)

They loved it

MOTHER
Who did

HIM (INTO PHONE)
Yeah I’ll be here Standing by
Are you there Hello

He lowers the phone thinking a lot

MOTHER
Who was that

HIM
My publisher

MOTHER
She’s read it

HIM
Yes of course Why

Mother is hurt

The phone RINGS again He takes the poem and answers the
phone

HIM
Yes Hi again Press Well you
know how I feel about it I’1ll be
here waiting
(a beat)
The house is great

Mother alone again wanders off She walks into the

NURSERY

And stares at the room

She notices the traces of a blood stain on the carpet She
feels it Dry Lifts the carpet There’s nothing there but
the patched wood floor

She exits the frame once again because when she returns it is

THREE AND A HALF MONTHS LATER

Mother is extremely pregnant in the

MASTER BATHROOM

Taking a shower The hot water massages her baby bump It
feels good

Later she throws on a robe and uses the hairbrush from her
hospital bag At dusk in the

KITCHEN
Dressed in an evening gown she takes a CAKE out of the oven
and sets it on the cooling rack She pokes the cake with a

toothpick It’s done

Outside the window from the corner of her eye something
rushes by

She looks Nothing there She stares for a moment just to
be sure

The sun dips behind the distant trees Night approaches
She heads to the
DINING ROOM

The table has been set for a beautiful meal She fills the
glasses HIM rounds down the stairs wearing a sports jacket

HIM
Amazing

MOTHER
Well we’re celebrating One day
every copy sold

He smiles and kisses her

HIM
Youre so beautiful

She glows in his compliment
MOTHER
Make yourself comfortable I’11 go
get everything

HIM
Looks delicious Let me help you

MOTHER
No Sit

HIM
No I’m helping

MOTHER
Ok will you bring the bread in

HIM
All right

Mother goes into the

PANTRY

As the door closes the room goes dark and she senses
something again

She flips on the back porch light and JUMPS
The ZEALOT stands right by the window Ragged and disheveled
he waves at her He holds a BOUND COPY of the poem HIM

wrote

ZEALOT
No please can I see him

She yelps and runs into the

DINING ROOM

HIM isn’t there She sees him out on the porch A small
populace forms around him From the

FOYER

She listens as questions rain down on HIM from the crowd

ZEALOT
Excuse me I have a question

MOTHER
What are you doing

HIM turns a big look of amazement on his face

MOTHER
Who are they

HIM
(thrilled)
I don’t know

He doesn’t but he’s excited to find out This confuses her
more

HIM
(to crowd)
Please wait

MOTHER
What do they want

He comes up to her
HIM
I don’t know They’ve come here to
see me
Her face barely reacts
HIM
Just keep everything warm I’11 be
right in
She has little response
He turns back to them and nods The crowd rustles
HIM
(gesturing to Zealot)
You had a question what is it
The Zealot steps forward eagerly
ZEALOT
As I was saying we’ve all traveled
a great distance and I feel that
these words I feel like they were

written for me

HIM
Of course they were

Mother slowly walks back into the

NURSERY

She paces the room not sure what to do Blood soaks up into
the carpet She lifts it up The blood stain is back

Disturbed she returns to the

FOYER

The crowd SOUNDS are much louder She glimpses out the
window There are scores of people out there

The Zealot now seems to be in a position of authority
protecting HIM who is the center of attention

The big crowd surrounds HIM They clamor for his autograph
They reach to shake his hand They swoon from his touch
Many snap pictures with their cellphones

Stunned she pushes into the doorway HIM notices her

HIM
My goddess Come here

She shakes her head no The Zealot rushes over to grab her

ZEALOT
Come

MOTHER
No stay away from me

HIM
No please leave her Thank you

The Zealot does immediately HIM comes to Mother

HIM
They love it They understand all
of it but it effects every one in
a different way It is remarkable
Come they want to meet you Come

MOTHER
No I don’t want to I don’t want
to Come inside

HIM
But they’ve come from so far--

MOTHER
Look at me I’m about to have our
baby Why is that not enough for
you

HIM
Of course it’s enough I’m not
going anywhere I’m here with you

MOTHER
I want to be alone with you

HIM
I’m with you Give me a second
She tears up He turns back to the crowd They CHEER again
She closes the door Then after a beat she locks it She
marches towards the
STAIRS

And sees the SUPPLICANT and her SON in the

DINING ROOM

Rushing into the pantry

SUPPLICANT
Come quick Just hang in there
hold it in

MOTHER
Hey

She cuts them off in the

PANTRY

The uninvited guests stop short

MOTHER
Excuse me-—
SUPPLICANT
Do you know where the bathroom is
MOTHER
You need to leave
SUPPLICANT
Where should I go
MOTHER
I don’t know but you can’t be in
here
SUPPLICANT
But my son He

The Supplicant looks down at her child He’s peeing himself

MOTHER
Oh Okay Come with me

SUPPLICANT
Thank you so much I’11 come back
and clean up

Mother notices the back door is open

MOTHER
Did you open this
She closes the back door and locks it
SUPPLICANT
(to Son)
Okay here we go Just a little bit

longer It’s okay we’ll get you
all dried off

MOTHER
After youre finished I really
need you to go back outside

She leads them into the

NURSERY

Where the PISSER is just finishing using the toilet

MOTHER
What are you doing
PISSER
How about a little privacy

Please

He rushes out the other door where a LINE a dozen people
deep behind the LINGERER snakes into the nursery She
follows

MOTHER
Sir

LINGERER
I’ve been waiting a long time
Excuse me

The Lingerer pushes past her and shuts the door She looks
at the line and the LOITERER

LOITERER
Hey wait your turn lady

Mother turns to the nursery where the AESTHETE and the
EPICURE are taking photos of the blood stain on the floor
It’s wetter and bloodier than before

MOTHER
How did you get in here

The Aesthete holds a camera up to her

AESTHETE
Could you get the two of us please

MOTHER
What

The Pisser takes the camera
PISSER
I got it I got it Get down right

in front of it

The Aesthete and Epicure pose for a photo next to the bloody
hole

EPICURE
It’s beautiful

MOTHER
Don’t touch that

AESTHETE
It’s so organic

MOTHER
All of you need to go outside

She notices someone lay out a bed roll in the

DRAWING ROOM
Where the acne-scarred DRUNKARD is settling in for the night

MOTHER
Hey Sir

He starts to take off his shoes
DRUNKARD
I’m just going to lay down for a

bit I don’t feel so good

MOTHER
No no You cannot lie down here

DRUNKARD
Why Are you staying in here

MOTHER
I live here This is my house

He starts laughing at her as if she’s telling a joke

DRUNKARD
(giggles to himself)
My house My house The poet says

it’s everyones house
He lays down and closes his eyes And he’s snoring The

front door opens The Zealot using HIM’s keys unlocks it
He leads a CONTINGENT OF DISCIPLES into the

KITCHEN

The disciples grab the meal she’s made for HIM They rush
the sink and fill water jugs Mother on their heels

ZEALOT
Food and drink my friends
MOTHER
Hey
ZEALOT
Oh this is nice We’ve got
vegetables
MOTHER
Stop All of you
ZEALOT
Check the cabinets And the
fridge
MOTHER

What are you doing
The Zealot grabs Mother’s cake

ZEALOT
Oh beautiful

MOTHER
No no that’s not for you

ZEALOT
He said to share

MOTHER
But it’s not yours

ZEALOT
They’re hungry and thirsty

The Zealot hands the cake off to a disciple

ZEALOT
Here you go Now take the fruit
and the cheese and the pickles Oh
and get those prickly pears

Mother closes the fridge and moves into the

DINING ROOM

Where disciples are moving furniture and setting up for a
meal One disciple cuts the cake and hands out pieces

She sees HIM taking a seat at the table where the DEVOTEE
stands with a copy of his book

DEVOTEE
Your writing is so beautiful

MOTHER
What is this What are you doing

He looks at her Smiles and focuses back on the book in
front of him He signs it for the Devotee

HIM
I’m showing them my appreciation

More people are lining up for autographs and photos
Disciples hang LARGE CEREMONIAL PHOTOS of HIM

Some FOLLOWERS lounge on the ground staring at him

Then the HERALD HIM’s publisher as blingy as she is loud
enters

She’s tailed by two excited ABETTORS carrying stacks of
books

HERALD
My genius Look at you The
second printing is here I wish
you would have told me about this
turn out

HIM
Have you met my--

The Herald spots Mother

HERALD
There she is

She kisses Mother

HERALD

The inspiration All right I have
to be honest I was a little
worried about him being holed up
here with you

(turns towards HIM)
I was nervous you’d never write
again

HIM
Of course not

The Herald turns back towards Mother

HERALD
But whatever you did it was worth
it And look at you Youre ready
to pop How are you feeling Are
you hot

Mother is about to answer
HERALD

It’s hot in here is it me It’s

boiling maybe someone could turn-

Just then one of the Abettors holds up an ORNATE EMPTY FRAME

ABETTOR
I’ve got it right here

HERALD
(to Mother)
Will you excuse me
She inspects the frame
HERALD
Let me see it Oh yes that’s
exactly what I wanted

She turns back to HIM
HERALD
The original where is it

HIM
(nod to drawing room)
It’s right there by the desk

Just then the Zealot enters from the drawing room
the original poem A crowd fills in around him

ZEALOT
I’ve got it

HERALD
Pardon me

ZEALOT

I’ve got it
The Herald reaches for the poem

HERALD
Ill take that Thank you

ZEALOT
No

HERALD
No it’s okay

ZEALOT
No don’t touch it

The Herald grabs his arm He pushes her away

HERALD
It’s fine

ZEALOT
Don’t touch it

HIM rushes over

HIM
What happened Hey Hey Easy
easy

HERALD
I’m just trying to put it in this
frame

HIM

OK Ill do it It’s all good
Let me see the frame

carrying

HIM takes the frame The Zealot hands him the poem HIM
slips it into the frame

Mother watches the THIEF grab HIM’s pen and a book from the
table and slip into the

PANTRY

She grabs a vase sitting on the sink She slips into the

KITCHEN
Mother chases after her

MOTHER
Hey Stop Give that back

THIEF
No I have to have something of
his

Mother snatches the vase away

THIEF
No

The Thief lunges for it They drop it and it SHATTERS

THIEF
You did it Now I gotta find
something else

The tone of the room changes Other DEVOTEES become
RANSACKERS When all of the fragments are gone the
ransackers grab whatever they can Things of value things
that are worthless

MOTHER
Get out All of you Stop This
doesn’t belong to you
Mother picks up the phone and dials 911

911 (ON PHONE)
911 What is your emergency

MOTHER
Can you help me

911 (ON PHONE)
What is your emergency ma’am

MOTHER
They’re stealing everything

911 (ON PHONE)
What is--

The PILFERER snatches the phone from her hand

PILFERER
Thank you

MOTHER
I was using that

PILFERER
(teaching)
It’s all right Share Like the
poet says

The PLUNDERER grabs the phone Pulls it out of the wall

PLUNDERER
(laughing)
Yeah SHARE

PILFERER
That’s not right

Several people with various souvenirs rush past her through
the hallway as Mother returns to the

DINING ROOM

Where HIM is now on his feet in a small circle of autograph
seekers - they hug him have him sign books and take selfies
with him It’s a mix of cheering and crying and shouting
All circling around HIM A release of love and joy

MOTHER
Stop

The NOVITIATE buries her head into HIM weeps and won’t let
go With gentle hands to her forehead and arm he pushes her
back But his hands are stained with ink and they leave an
INK SMUDGE on her forehead

Mother pushes through the madness Someone tries to grab
her She pushes them away careful to protect her very
pregnant stomach

MOTHER
Stop Stop touching him

Other autograph seekers see the smudge and covet it

MOTHER
They’re ruining everything

HIM
Those are just things They can be
replaced Don’t worry

The Herald appears with the CHRONICLER and his camera
HERALD

Coming through please Forgive me
just a few shots

HIM
Of course
MOTHER
No No
HERALD

(to Chronicler)
Make sure you’re getting him

Flashes start flashing Mother starts to pull away

HERALD
No don’t go

But Mother pulls away She sees the Zealot lead a dancing
crowd in some type of formation dance He jumps and slides
while holding the framed original poem on a stick She
marches up the stairs to the

MASTER BEDROOM

Mother shuts the door and goes to the window In the
darkness outside she sees more people approach

She’s unsure what to do She presses her hands against the
wall and closes her eyes into the

DARKNESS OF HER IMAGINATION

The house breathes hard The pipes creak and cry The wires

throb The house is scared We see the soul of the house
retreating twisting away Back in the

MASTER BEDROOM

She makes up her mind She zips up her hospital bag grabs
it and marches down the stairs She pauses at the

HALF LANDING

The wall covering the door to the study is now plastered with
ceremonial photos of HIM In front of it the Zealot applies
ink smudges to devotees’ foreheads one by one Disciples
keep the long line of waiting devotees orderly

DISCIPLE
Step forward

A female devotee steps forward

ZEALOT
His words are yours If you
please pin your thoughts on the
wall

She pins a photo to the wall and receives an ink smudge Now
it’s the next devotee’s turn

DISCIPLE
Step forward

ZEALOT
His words are yours dear

Mother walks down the stairs pushing past the long line of
devotees towards the

FOYER

Where a THRONG parties Popping Champagne Making out
Laughing More revelers pour in the front door knocking
each other over Friends greet and hug each other The
party spills towards Mother

She looks for the back door The dining room has evolved
into a full on dance party So has the kitchen

The Herald spots her
HERALD
There you are Where have you been
hiding

As flashbulbs fire Mother spins the other way into the

HALLWAY

Where the HEWER saws an archway in half Mother shocked
charges him He slices off the jamb on the basement door and
yanks it away

MOTHER
Why are you doing this

HEWER
Proof we were here

Mother pushes into the

NURSERY
Where disciples carry off the crib

MOTHER
No Don’t

Mother accidentally steps on the bloody stain Her foot
plunges through the moist and rotten wood Disgusted she
pulls her foot out and slips into the

BATHROOM

Where LOOTERS strip the fixtures off the walls

She hurries into the

KITCHEN

Where the looting has escalated A group of SWEATY LOOTERS
pry the stove off the wall Others stand on the island
trying to get to the ceiling lights Someone knocks over the
island crashing everyone to the ground Mother hurries into
the

PANTRY

FANS flood in through the back door She fights to get past
them and their shrieks to freedom but the Zealot grabs her

ZEALOT
Hey

MOTHER
No Let go

ZEALOT
No you can’t leave he loves you

She pulls away She pushes harder towards the back door

HIM rushes in The crowd surges towards him Disciples push
them back and clear the room Devotees screech for the poet

HIM sees her hospital bag

HIM
Where are you going Don’t go

MOTHER
You don’t want me here

HIM
Come here

MOTHER
I can’t

HIM
Please I have to tell you
something

Just then she SHAKES with a contraction

HIM
What

She can’t answer He understands and shifts

HIM
The baby The baby

Mother nods He scans the looming crowd

HIM
(to Mother)
Okay come here Come come
(to disciples)
We need space We need space

A disciple locks the back door Others try to help HIM find
a path through the crowds

HIM
to Mother)
Hold on here I’1l be right back

He tries to find a path into the

HALLWAY

Where the people continue to beg for his attention his
signature his image

HIM
Give us some room

He shoves the masses back The populace resists They start
to boo

HIM
Give us some room give us some
room
Behind Mother OFFICERS OF THE LAW burst through the back
door glass smashes the door frame cracks They arrest
disciples
Mother grabs the passing DEPUTY

MOTHER
Help me Help me--

DEPUTY
Hands off

He spins her around to cuff her
MOTHER
No Please don’t Please don’t
My baby
HIM yanks the cop away

HIM
Get off her

The Deputy sprays HIM with pepper spray Part of the blast
hits Mother’s face She screams

She spins away as a line of OFFICERS tackle HIM to the
ground

Mother’s eyes burn as she pushes into the

KITCHEN

Where MINING-LOOTERS attack the floor tear into the house’s
foundation The sink is ripped out No water So she
stumbles into the

GUEST BATHROOM

Mother eyes watering heads for the tub water The
FORNICATOR sobs on the lip He laments the requiem

The GLEANER yanks the faucet and loots it

GLEANER
I called dibs

Water sprays Mother rinses her burning eyes

The sound of three gun SHOTS blast from the kitchen It’s
followed by a mad STAMPEDE of ransackers

They swarm around Mother pushing her in front of them as
they scramble for the

NURSERY

Mother trips and falls on the steps as the panicking crowd
surges over her She spots Man’s long lost METAL LIGHTER
glinting from a grate on the floor

Mother crawls to her feet The blood stained floor is now a
gaping WOUND Maggots infest it

In the crib nook there’s a newly constructed holding pen
Imprisoned are YOUNG SLAVES clothes ripped and torn arms
bound They beg for help

Mother tries to find an exit from the chicken wire pen but
the WHOREMONGER pins her against the wall The SLAVEDRIVER
tosses another young girl into the holding pen

The Whoremonger pries open Mother’s mouth examining her gums
and teeth He squeezes her bosom her pregnant belly

SLAVEDRIVER
How is she

WHOREMONGER
Tainted

The power flips off as RIOT POLICE in full armor burst out
from the bathroom They attack the sex traffickers as they
rush towards Mother pushing her into the

DRAWING ROOM

Mother ducks into the corner as the riot police storm into a
standoff between cops and PROTESTORS Copies of the poem
burn in barrels between the two sides

Someone tosses a Molotov cocktail and two OFFICERS explode in
flames

Mayhem as it turns into a full on riot Another contraction
SLAMS Mother as she slips into the

STAIRWELL

Where a BAND OF INSTIGATORS stand on a pile of debris and
broken furniture shouting slogans Workers are reinforcing
the pile and turning it into a new structure - into some type
of tower

A CHANTING CROWD bursts through the front door with signs and
banners

Another STREAM OF MARCHERS pours down the stairs Mother is
caught in the middle and pulled with them into the

DINING ROOM

A BAND OF REVOLUTIONARIES stand over two lines of prone
PRISONERS whose hands are bound behind them Their heads are
covered with cheap plastic bags

The swinging pantry door is gone It is replaced by a
chicken wire gate behind which more prisoners are being
held

As Mother cowers by the mantel she sees an executioner
walking down the lines of prisoners shooting each one in the
head Mother screams

The executioner turns to Mother We see her face for the
first time It is the Herald

HERALD
The inspiration Where have you
been hiding
(to revolutionaries)
Finish her

Two revolutionaries grab Mother and push her to her knees and
prepare to handcuff her wrists

REVOLUTIONARY GUARD
On your knees

The Herald moves to the wire holding pen and starts to select
a few more prisoners

HERALD
All right six more

An EXPLOSION tears out a window killing the Herald
instantly

Armed MILITARY FORCES burst into the home They rush through
doorways and smash through windows

Mother is overwhelmed by a contraction Still she flees
stepping over the Herald’s mutilated body back into the
HALLWAY

Everything is covered in grey ash The SOLDIER COCKS his
gun

SOLDIER
Freeze
(sees she is no threat)
Oh no Come on

The Solider leads Mother through the

STAIRWELL

More troops burst through the front door Guns are fired
REFUGEES flee Tear gas and explosions The Soldier leads
her from the newly built tower to a corner in the

DRAWING ROOM

Where they find a sheltered spot to rest

SOLDIER
Are you hurt

MOTHER
The baby

A grenade goes off nearby tearing away the wall to the
basement He shields her with his body

A contraction hits again The Soldier notices her condition

SOLDIER
Medic

He looks up and around Someone SHOOTS him through the jaw
He crumples in front of her

Mother screams in terror and falls forward into the

NURSERY

Which has become a killing field CORPSES are everywhere
SICK PLAGUE VICTIMS moan in agony Mother sees the open
window by the bathroom

Some refugees rush to exit the home

REFUGEE
This way Hurry Hurry

She claws to it She pulls herself up and over body after
body Even when a contraction ROCKS her she keeps crawling

Almost out when two hands GRAB HER The man tears off his
gas mask it’s HIM cloaked and hidden He is crazed and wild-
eyed

HIM
(relieved)
It’s me It’s me

MOTHER
What’s happening

HIM
I don’t know I have to take you
somewhere safe

MOTHER
There OUT

HIM
No it’s too dangerous Come with
me quietly

He takes her hand starts dragging her towards the

GUEST BATHROOM

Which is full of shanties tents and lean-tos Refugees
have made small cooking fires Grey ash covers all She
follows as he pulls her through the

KITCHEN

Still more survivors Ladders poke up through holes in the
floor Pieces of field stone and beams from the foundation
have been used to make slightly more permanent encampments

She spots the back door and the forest beyond

MOTHER
The door The door

HIM
No this way

The filthy PENITENT notices HIM
PENITENT
It’s him the poet He hasn’t
forsaken us after all
HIM
Come we need to hurry Stay
close
BEGGARS THE SICK AMPUTEES surge them Mother and HIM run
through the
HALLWAY

Around the growing tower of debris Still they are swarmed

HIM
Get back

PENITENTS
Help us We’re hungry Were
lost Fuck him He abandoned
us

In the

STAIRWELL
The bottom steps are gone The front door is boarded up

Penitents follow and swarm in from all sides They fight to
grab HIM

HIM
I’m sorry I can’t

Mother panics Her contractions are quick and FURIOUS

HIM
I’m sorry I will not forget you
He pushes and pulls against the swarm

ZEALOT (0S)
Up here

She looks up The Zealot stands above them on the new tower
It stretches up to the half landing

HIM
They will protect us

Disciples swarm down to help the couple up the tower

The mass of humanity follows them others clambering up onto
the broken stairs

ZEALOT
Give me your hand

Mother is pulled up with HIM to the

HALF LANDING
HIM and the Zealot fight to keep the crowds back

HIM
Get back I will return

Mother leans against a wall just as another contraction hits
She is delirious with pain

HIM
Sit here Rest

The HEALER emerges from the crowd

HEALER
I’m a doctor I’m a doctor

HIM
A doctor Help her please I’11
be right back

The Healer takes a knee and feels Mother’s belly Mother
doesn’t want any help She wants nothing to do with these
strangers

The study remains sealed shut HIM starts kicking the planks
that seal the door with the heel of his boot

HEALER
Look at me Listen to my voice
The baby’s almost here

Mother SCREAMS in agony

Humanity stretches reaches pleads for mercy “Help us
Help Help us” The disciples fight to keep them back

Some break through HIM stops kicking grabs them and tosses
them back off the landing He returns to smashing the door

The labor grows more intense The Healer pries Mother’s legs
open

HEALER
Now just push Yes yes you have
to push

Finally HIM gets past the planks and kicks the STUDY door
open The crowd overwhelms the disciples

HEALER
Yes you’re doing very good I can
feel the head--
HIM rushes over pushes the doctor away
HIM
Please move I’ve got her Come
I’ve got you now

He lifts Mother up

ZEALOT
Wait I can help

HIM
I’m delivering my baby Shut the
door Shut the door Shut it

He drags Mother into the

STUDY
And lays her against his desk
HIM
Were safe Were safe It’s

okay Our baby’s coming

Mother tries to catch her breath The fighting outside
blasts the study door back open

He gets to his feet and shoves everyone back He closes the
door Then he drags a heavy secretary to block the door
from opening again People bang on the door as the riot
outside continues

He rushes back to Mother He reaches between her legs

HIM
Okay it’s almost here

Mother SCREAMS

HIM
It’s here It’s coming

She continues to scream Shaking herself shaking the world

And she screams as the baby releases into

WHITE
Vibrating energy And after a beat

HIM (VO)
It’s a boy

Return slowly to the

STUDY

HIM holds the baby as Mother opens her eyes

He lifts the child onto her chest Her SON She holds him
He is perfect Mother starts to cry Tears of joy

The sounds of war are still outside the door

HIM touches the baby’s feet a look of wonder on his face He

grabs a cotton cloth that drapes the lazy chair He uses it
to wrap the child in her arms

HIM
Cover him

The baby CRIES its first cry The noise echoes through the
house

Suddenly the sounds of violence drop out It gets quiet
Real quiet Outside the study there is now no more noise

They are confused Mother looks at the door

MOTHER
What’s happening Why are they so
quiet

HIM

I don’t know
He heads to the door

MOTHER
Don’t

He listens to the door He hears nothing He slides back
the secretary

MOTHER
Don’t do that

He cracks open the door and peeks He spots something He
bends down and picks up a basket filled with fruit and a
pitcher of water

MOTHER
Shut the door Seal it

He does it and uses the secretary to block the door He
carries the goods back to her

HIM
They brought us gifts

He pours her a glass of water She watches him suspiciously

MOTHER
What are they doing

HIM
Theyre just waiting

MOTHER
Waiting for what

HIM
I don’t know
MOTHER
Make them go Please Please make

them
He thinks Then he nods

HIM
Okay okay

He returns to the door He pauses to look at her then he
slips outside He seals the door behind him
Mother is alone with her child They look into one another

She lifts him up and wraps him properly in the cloth

LATER

The door opens HIM returns in new clothes He carries a
shirt and sweat pants

HIM
More gifts Look here For you
Clean clothes

He lays them next to her

MOTHER
Are they leaving

An awkward pause

HIM
What No they just want to see
him

MOTHER

No Make them go

HIM
I can’t
MOTHER
(pleads )

Yes you can They adore you They
would listen to you

He doesn’t respond to that

MOTHER
Why won’t you

HIM
(snaps honestly )
I don’t want them to go

Mother stunned He comes to her She tries to back away
Scared

HIM
He’s beautiful
(then)
Let me hold him
MOTHER
No
HIM

Let me hold him

Mother shakes her head

HIM
Let me hold my baby
MOTHER
No
HIM
Let me hold him
MOTHER
NO
HIM

I’m his father

MOTHER
I’m his MOTHER

That stops him For the moment He sighs
On his feet he gets behind the big chair

He sighs again and pushes it forward so that it is inches
from her

He takes a seat and he just sits He sits and he stares at
her

Time is on his side So he waits

She stares at him He stares at her

HOURS GO BY

At dawn he sits wide eyed staring at her barely blinking
The baby is fussing and she calms it She reaches for the
new shirt starts to put it on He tries to help

HIM
Here let me-

MOTHER
No

Keeping her eyes on him she slips the shirt on

LATE IN THE DAY
The baby feeds on his mother’s breast Her eyelids grow
heavy HIM stares straight at her barely blinking She
looks at the fruit bowl which is almost empty
MOTHER
(pleads )
Please PLEASE Make them go

He doesn’t respond

AT NIGHT

She fights with all her will but sleep descends on her Her
eyelids are so heavy She can’t help but pass out to

SILENCE

She fights to wake up Her eyes fling open in the

STUDY

HIM carries the baby to the open door lifting the boy into
the air the crowd screams in delight

Adrenaline floods her heart she lunges after them panic

ripping through her soul Through the doorway she descends
the

TOWER

The crowd applauds and cheer the baby The doorway has been
turned into the entrance of a shrine it’s covered with
offerings and burning incense

MOTHER
No No Give me back my baby

She fights to get through the throngs She spins HIM around
looks at his arms They are empty His face is a mix of
shock horror and awe

MOTHER
Where is he

She looks past him The baby moves from hand to hand
Carried like a rock star surfing a mosh pit deep into the

DRAWING ROOM

The crippled the ill the healthy the happy the sad
everyone surges towards the baby Mother dives in after him

MOTHER
No no that’s my baby I’m his
Mother

Hands reach Hands pull Hands grab They all want to
touch him

MOTHER
No no please you’re going to
hurt him you’re hurting him
The baby SHRIEKS Then something SNAPS
And the baby stops crying There are gasps

MOTHER
Where is he Where’s my baby

She fights her way through the crowd looking for her son
his body in the

DINING ROOM

The Zealot spins and appears before her He is bald now and
an ink smudge is on his brow

MOTHER
(hysterical)
Where’s my baby

ZEALOT
He’s not dead

What She doesn’t understand

ZEALOT
A voice still cries out to be
heard loud and strong Listen
Can you hear that

A strange answer She hears the crowd crying sobbing They
are hysterical She realizes what the Zealot means

She pushes past the bald man

On the ALTAR lies the remnants of her child Meat has been
picked from the child’s bones

She looks around People eat pieces of flesh When they
take a bite they are filled with peace

ZEALOT (0S)

Do you hear that That’s the sound
of life the sound of humanity

His cry of love His love for you

Mother grabs for the pieces of meat For her son The
people fight her off Someone drags her to the ground

There’s a shard of GLASS on the floor From a broken window
She takes it She turns on the MASSES around her She stabs
and attacks

People fall one by one Others retreat terrified of her Of
her weapon

She keeps killing more and more people

People panic as she chases men women and children She
stabs them all in the back in the throat in the eyes
wherever she can

She screams with the agony deep in her soul

She drives the shard deep into the belly of the Zealot He
grabs her wrist She looks him in the face He holds the
doorknob that first killed brother on brother

The Zealot smashes her with it

She collapses to the ground The mob descends They beat
her they kick her they scratch her they tear off her
clothes and they spit on her They defile her

HIM emerges smashing through the masses trying to save her

HIM
Please stop Stop STOP

And ALL do The people back away chins down

HIM
(to the crowd)
Go away Leave her alone What
are you doing

She’s bloodied Her nose is broken One eye starts to
swell

HIM
Look what they’ve done to you

HIM
(to the crowd)
What are you doing WHAT ARE YOU
DOING

MOTHER
They killed my baby You killed
him You killed him

HIM
I am so sorry They just wanted to
see him they just wanted to touch

him and then they It’s
horrible I’m sorry I’m so
sorry

They are overwhelmed by grief They sob He holds her
tight Blood drips from her face

HIM
But we can’t let him die for
nothing We can’t Maybe what
happened can change everything
everyone

MOTHER
What are you talking about

HIM
We have to find a way to forgive
them

MOTHER

They butchered our son

HIM
I know

She pushes him away She crawls away backwards

MOTHER
You’re insane

HIM

They are so sorry They are truly

sorry Please have faith in me

We need to forgive them
She drops her hands to the ground closes her eyes and we slip
into the
DARKNESS OF HER IMAGINATION
And the house is barely alive Shrinking and dying
Everything almost completely still Back in the
DINING ROOM

She can hold it in no longer

MOTHER
Nooooo

The ground SHAKES violently The floor RIPS apart
The crowd shrieks panicking She rises up
MOTHER
(at everyone)
Murderers
(at HIM)
Murderer
Her eyes wild she scratches his face
MOTHER
It’s time to get the fuck out of my
house
Long gashes are left behind Skin is under her nails
She races off fighting through the crowd
HIM (0S)
No Don’t Please come back

Don’t leave me

She bursts through the masses praying into the

NURSERY
In the radiator grate is Man’s METAL LIGHTER She grabs it

She rushes through the

HALLWAY

And trips She tumbles face first down the stairs to the

BASEMENT
She lands hard on the concrete floor She picks up the
wrench she used earlier and drags her broken body into the
HIDDEN CELLAR
People chase after her led by HIM
HIM
(to crowd)
Stop Please Hold on
They do Mother swings the wrench and punctures the bottom
of the oil tank Thick oil rolls out onto the basement
floor She pulls out the METAL LIGHTER and lights it
HIM
(to Mother)
Don’t Please don’t I love you
MOTHER
You never loved me You just loved
how much I loved you I gave you
everything

The flame on the lighter flicks and leaps

MOTHER
And you gave it all away

HIM
No No NO

And she drops the lighter The
OIL IGNITES

Fire rushes into the tank and

EXPLODES

He drops his head defeated The flames rip through him and
his followers and every living thing in the

BASEMENT

Flames smash through the

HALLWAY

Fire engulfs one and all SCREAMS of misery and agony as the
Masses rush the front door in the

FOYER

A huge fireball rushes up through the

STAIRWELL

And torches the

STUDY

Everything is ruined and destroyed Now

OUTSIDE

The world EXPLODES Everything burns Everything is on
fire And down in the

HIDDEN CELLAR FILLED WITH FLAMES

Mother is calm Even as her skin burns she is calm

Just HER eyes defiant sad defeated but free

She closes her eyes as all goes to

WHITE

A long moment until we return to the charred remains of
Mother being carried through the

BURNT HOUSE

In his arms He carries her with little emotion and less
effort He’s trying to be strong He is not burnt The

scars on his face are healing

She is charred and near death She watches the house
smoldering around him

MOTHER
(whisper)
What are you

He notices her for the first time

HIM
Me I am I You You were home

MOTHER
Where are you taking me

HIM
The beginning

He lowers her down on the desk of his

BURNT STUDY
She cringes in pain

HIM
It won’t hurt much longer

MOTHER
What hurts me the most is that I
wasn’t enough

This chokes him up

HIM
It’s not your fault Nothing is
ever enough I couldn’t create if
it was And I have to That’s
what I do That’s what I am And
now I must try it all again

MOTHER
(understands )
No
(asks)
Just let me go

HIM
I need one last thing

MOTHER
I have nothing left to give

He disagrees

HIM
Your love
(he points at her chest)
It’s still there isn’t it

She starts to cry She nods He’s right What choice does
she have

MOTHER
Go ahead Take it

She lets it all go No more emotion No more ever again

He knows what he must do He plunges his hands into the
remnants of her chest

She gasps He pulls out a MASS of beating ash

The last drop of life fades from her body leaving only an
ashen HUSK

Alone now he squeezes the mass in his hands He squeezes
hard until it solidifies Then with more force it breaks
apart leaving a NEW CRYSTAL FORMATION

Just like the one at the beginning But this one is
different Beautiful and amazing but different

He places the crystal on a burnt shelf in the

CHARRED BOOKCASE
He closes his eyes Wishes

Slowly color repairs the shelf returning it to an un-burnt
state

Now dawn light reveal glimpses inside a slightly different

HOME

A burnt front door comes back to life It fades into a burnt
hand rail which comes back to life The hand rail fades into
a burnt wall which comes back to life The wall becomes the
burnt sheets on a bed ina

MASTER BEDROOM
They come back to life A BODY emerges before us A young

NEW WOMAN emerges in a comfortable bed hugged by white
sheets

She is different Beautiful and amazing but different
She spots his pillow He’s not there She asks

NEW WOMAN
Baby

There’s no answer

HARD TO BLACK
