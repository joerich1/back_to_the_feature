INT STEVEN SCHWIMMERS LOFT
Steven is just waking up The radio plays soft music
He reaches over and hits the off button then activates

cassette player He struggles out of bed and Sufi music
begins to fill the room

He stands at the foot of the bed a man in his mid-
hollow-chested slightly potbellied wearing rumpled

bottoms and a Mostly Mozart T-shirt

He does not remove the sleep mask

The music has a sensuous driving beat Voices begin to
chant

Steven holds his arms parallel to the floor Slowly he
to turn clockwise The beat picks up and he whirls
quickly his mouth coming open

Now he begins to whirl about the room The chanting
intensity Although he is blindfolded Steve deftly

avoids
running into furniture and other objects
Steven stops whirling at the precise moment the music
stops
playing He is back at the foot of the bed arms
stretched
wide

He leads them toward a booth

INT COFFEE SHOP - LATER

Nicky is launched into a full breakfast Laurel has a
tea bag
in a cup -- no water

NICKY
If lawyers for the mob are called
controversial why are divorce
lawyers called prominent

LAUREL
Because they get outstanding
settlements And Mother is
determined that this time theres
no turning back

NICKY
I just had breakfast with her She
didnt say a word about this

A young waiter recognizes Nicky and unobtrusively points him
out to another waiter

LAUREL
Because you refuse to believe shes
serious Youve always refused

NICKY
Dont be so steely-eyed Its that
course youre taking in

criminology
LAUREL
Oh please Not now
(beat)

She wants you to stop seeing Whats-
Her-Name Finally Now and forever
Do you think thats too much to

ask For a wife of nineteen years

NICKY
Youre too young to be studying
criminal behavior Its making you
obsessive

LAUREL
She is kicking you out

NICKY
Your mother and I have something
between us thats too strong to
damage permanently Believe me I
know this Thats right nineteen
years And what about the days and
minutes Sharing small moments
sharing memories raising a
beautiful child Were wedded in
the deepest and strongest ways
Lillian isnt only my wife Shes
my best friend

Nicky shrugs

LAUREL
Bullshit Daddy

register
each holding a check

LAUREL

NICKY
Dont call her Mother all the time
It makes her sound tragic and
unforgiving What happened to Mom

LAUREL
I didnt turn her into Mother You
did

NICKY
This person and I are a thing of
the total past I promise you

Nicky takes Laurels check away from her intendin

masochistic relish

A year and a half later Youre
still brooding

A patron approaches the table and stares at Nicky with a
fixed grin of crazed recognition

is inside The makeshift wardrobe is empty except for
five hangers with shirts and jackets There is no one

A sound faint but persistent like an intake of air

away leaving a hole in the floor Brownish water drips

NICKY
When the Mets lose they just lose
Its a flat feeling But the Red
Sox -- here we have a rich history
of interesting ways to lose a
crucial game Defeats that keep you
awake that pound in your head like
the hammer of fate

Paisley walks across the room toward the kitchen Nicky
pauses to watch her then resumes speaking

NICKY
You can analyze a Red Sox defeat
day and night for a month and still
uncover layers of complex feelings -
- feelings you didnt know you were
capable of The pain has a memory
all of its own

NICKY
And the Father replies

PETER

cardboard boxes against the wall His hate mail He is
wearing a bath towel like a prayer shawl over his sweat

He drags one of the boxes to the ratty armchair He
the chair by the filthy window that looks west toward
early-setting sun
He takes a letter from the box opens it reads it
fall to the floor Takes another letter opens it --
There is a knock at the door

Another knock
He moves warily toward the door

prowls the loft

PAISLEY
In other words I never understood
until today how much pain and
anxiety youve been causing with
your reviews Steven its so
unfair

STEVEN
Of course its unfair The truth is
always unfair Why do you think I
live this way Hiding out Stealing
electricity from a lamp post
Because people who write the truth
are outcasts of society I cant
live openly in a nice clean
doorman building with my name on
the mailbox Theyd come after me
in packs

PAISLEY
Not if you stopped hurting people
Write the truth gently

STEVEN
The truth is never gentle Listen
to me carefully Each of us lives
in the thinnest possible wrapping
of wishes and dreams Truth is the
force that penetrates this wispy
skin It hurts and maims

“How completely phony Whoever made

LAUREL
Faster Daddy

EXT 48TH STREET

The taxi crosses Park Avenue speeding past the bronze
of a man hailing a cab
It approaches First Avenue where a road divider

thoroughfare Nicky swings into a sharp turns barely
averting contact with the divider and stops abruptly

Three doors open On the empty street Nicky hands the
a wad of bills Then he and Laurel step over the

puts his arm around her shoulders and they cross the
to the glass tower where they live

The sun begins to climb out of the East River

THE END
