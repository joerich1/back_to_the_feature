TITLE OVER BLACK SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 1983

EXT LORRAINE’S HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
A very ordinary house

That’s how you would describe it if you saw it Not ominous
but ordinary

An ordinary car arrives to join the house - a Honda Accord
It sputters to a halt curb side A woman clambers out of it
We can’t see her properly she is hidden in silhouette

She glares up at the two story house pausing Apprehensive

INT ENTRY WAYLIVING ROOM LORRAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT LORRAINE LAMBERT scampers to answer a knock at the door

She is clad in jeans and T-shirt a strong single mother who
knows how to be a father too She peels the door open to
reveal ELISE RAINIER (40s) The Honda Accord owner

ELISE
You must be Lorraine

LORRAINE
You must be Elise

ELISE
You must be crazy to wear a T-shirt
in this cold

Elise cracks up She has an easy infectious laugh
LORRAINE
I’m sorry it’s so late My day job kinda
makes raising my son a night job
ELISE
It’s fine In my line of work
things don’t tend to happen until
it gets dark
INT LIVING ROOM LORRAINE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Lorraine guides Elise into the spacious well-lit living
room Elise gazes around smiling surveying the house

A man is fiddling with a 16mm camera in the center of the
room sitting on an equipment box This is CARL STANAWAY Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

Carl is a soft-spoken wise old soul Everything he says and
does is considered and thoughtful

ELISE
Ahoy there Carl

Carl looks up smiling ruefully He is relieved to see Elise
He rises and embraces her He looks ragged

CARL
Thank you for coming Elise

ELISE
I’m always happy to help

LORRAINE
Would you like some coffee Or tea

ELISE
No thanks I’d like to get started
right away if that’s okay Carl
told me on the phone that your son
is the one affected is that right

LORRAINE
Yes That’s right My son Josh

ELISE
May I meet him

LORRAINE
Of course I’1l go get him

Lorraine hustles up the stairs Carl lowers his voice to a
grave whisper

CARL
I didn’t know what else to do
Except call you

ELISE
You had a terrible psychic presence
that was making you sick and you
thought you’d make it my problem

She cracks herself up again Carl doesn’t share it Elise
explores the living room as Carl talks to her She approaches
a series of framed photos tacked to the wall Most of them
are of a young boy

CARL
I started with the usual checks
Mental health tests medical
records All normal

Elise beams as her eyes trace across the photos taken by the
young boy’s cuteness

CARL (CONT’D)
I interviewed the boy but he
doesn’t want to tell me anything
He’s scared I thought maybe you
could get something out of him

Elise pauses on one particular photothe boy at around ten
He is slouched on a couch in a baseball uniform Behind him
is a set of drapes a lamp all shrouded in shadow the
exposure focused on the boy

CARL (CONT’D)

There’s definitely something in this
house I can feel it It doesn’t
want me here It’s the strongest
presence I’ve ever felt I’m afraid
of it just like the boy

(beat)
I need your help Elise I failed

ELISE
You worry too much Carl Always
have This isn’t an exact science

Elise turns back to the photo Her smile slowly deflates A
hint of concern in her eyes Is there something in the
shadows A person Hard to tell by looking Elise senses it

LORRAINE (0S)
She’s right there

Elise STARTS jolted out of her focus She turns to see
Lorraine herding the young boy from the photo down the stairs
- JOSH LAMBERT Lorraine tows and Josh resists

LORRAINE (CONTD)
(to Josh firm)
Come on just say hi to her She
just wants to talk to you for a
little bit You’re not being polite
Josh No politeness no baseball

Josh sees that Elise is looking at him Softens embarrassed

YOUNG JOSH
Hi

ELISE
Hi Josh I’m Elise

Josh musters a half-hearted smile Distracted

ELISE (CONTD)
Your mom’s right I’d love to ask
you some simple questions The good
kind the kind you can’t get wrong

INT LIVING ROOM LORRAINE’S HOUSE - LATER

We see a POV FROM THE 16MM CAMERA - it frames up Josh
sitting on the couch pulsing in and out of focus at first

ELISE (0S)
Do you like living here

YOUNG JOSH
Yeah

ELISE (0S)

Good for you Are there a lot of
kids your age in this neighborhood

YOUNG JOSH
A few One kid lives next door

ELISE (0S)
Oh that must be nice

YOUNG JOSH
Nah He’s pretty lame

OUT OF POV - The camera whirs as it chews up film Carl
operates the camera Lorraine observes from the corner
clutching a cushion like a life-preserver

ELISE
Is there anything you don’t like
about living in this house

YOUNG JOSH
No

ELISE
Nothing bad happens here at night

A long beat Josh scans the room

YOUNG JOSH
I get scared when it gets dark I’m
a wimp

ELISE

No You’re not It gets dark for all of
us eventually And we’re all scared of
it

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

Josh is clearly not comfortable talking Elise changes tact

ELISE (CONTD)
Id like to try something with you
Josh I promise it won’t hurt

INT LIVING ROOM LORRAINE’S HOUSE - LATER

A hand lights a candle It is Elise The flame frolics across
her face The room is darker now Josh is still sitting
opposite Elise

ELISE
Close your eyes I want you to
relax

Josh gulps and closes his eyes

Elise takes out a METRONOME propping it on the table next to
her and setting it in motion Tickticktick

ELISE (CONTD)
Listen to the tickingfocus on
it Tune everything else out

WE PULL AROUND JOSH’S BACK circling the room

ELISE (0S) (CONTD)
Take a deep breath Feel yourself
getting sleepier

When we complete the circle Josh is in a deep trance The
whole house is silent Carl triggers the camera again

ELISE (CONTD)
I’m going to ask you some
questions and I want you to tell
me the truth Can you do that

Josh replies in the narcotic tones of the hypnotized his
body as still and sullen as a sculpture

YOUNG JOSH
Yes

ELISE
I want you to tell me who all the
people are in this house right now

YOUNG JOSH

Me my mom Elise Carland the
old woman

Carl looks up from the camera prickled by goosebumps

ELISE
What old woman Josh

YOUNG JOSH
She talks to me at night

ELISE
What does she say

YOUNG JOSH
She wants me to go with her

ELISE
Go with her where

YOUNG JOSH
Out into the dark where she lives

ELISE
Where is she right at this moment

YOUNG JOSH
I can’t tell you She doesn’t like
other people Only me

Elise gets up leaning in close to Carl and whispering Carl
opens his equipment box and wrests two walkie-talkies out of
it handing one to Elise

ELISE
How about if we play a game Josh
It’s called hot and cold I’1l walk
around the house and you tell me if
I’m getting warmer or colder Do

YOUNG JOSH
Yes

Carl squats in front of Josh holding the walkie up to his
mouth Elise leaves the room headed for the kitchen

It wants to be him

(beat)
Your son has a gift Miss Lambert
When he sleeps at night he is able
to explore another world But it
can be a dangerous gift He can
attract the attention of the
darkest part of that world

LORRAINE
What can you do to stop it

ELISE
I could wipe his memory of his
gift Make him forget how to visit
that world

Lorraine turns to face her boy still in a trance state Her
fear and concern for her son swirl on her face

LORRAINE
Do it Make him forget

EXT CEMETERY - DAY

The sun flares down on a large congregation of mourners They
are gathered around an open grave

A casket is lowered into the grave Lorraine Josh Renai and
Dalton hover over it Renai cradles Cali and FOSTER slinks
behind Josh who is wearing DARK SUNGLASSES

We PAN across the disparate group of grievers So many
different ages and races A true mix all dressed in black

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

One of the mourners is CARL who we met in the opening scene
He’s aged a lot in the past thirty years but still wears the
same expression of pensive thought

We finally come to rest on two men - SPECS and TUCKER

PRIEST
--and this is not the endfor
though dear Elise’s body may have
left us her spirit goes on to the
kingdom of Heaven and the life
everlasting that awaits her there

Specs looks up finding Josh in the crowd and staring at him

EXT CEMETERY - LATER
The mourners dissipate scattering like leaves

Specs and Tucker meander away from the crowd heads down A tall
man in an ill-fitting suit huffs up the hill behind them This
is DAVID FOX He is holding a folder of papers

FOX
Gentlemen a moment of your time

They stop and turn suspicious

FOX (CONT’D)
I’ve had some trouble reaching you
You’re not easy men to locate

TUCKER
If the US government feels the same
way then my plan is working

Fox holds out the folder Specs accepts it

FOX

representing Elise Rainier’s
estate

INT LORRAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
The front door groans open and the family lumbers inside
still bedecked in their funeral black The whole brood looks
dour fatigued by the emotions of the day

clustered in boxes The closet doors face the bed

The main difference is that there are now TWO single beds on
opposite sides of the room rather than one

He climbs out of bed and scurries over to Dalton handing him a
plastic cup then whips back to his bed stretching out a
string between the two beds It’s a homemade tin-can telephone
Foster covers his mouth with the cup

DALTON
No that’s stupid

FOSTER
Come on It really works I wanna
ask you something

DALTON
Just ask me normally

Dalton gives up and places his ear up to his cup
FOSTER
(through cup)
Umwhat do you think of this
DALTON

Josh pokes his head in Busted The boys feign sleep
JOSH
You think I’m falling for that

A TV facing the bed is on a newscast droning quietly

She is the only person still awake in the house And then --
a baby crying interrupts the quiet
INT CORRIDOR LORRAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Renai pads down the corridor stopping at a particular door

INT CALI’S BEDROOM LORRAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Renai tip-toes inside As soon as she does the crying
CEASES The room is dark save for a glowing NIGHT LIGHT

Renai leans over the crib - seeing that Cali is sound asleep

Unnerved Renai claws through a cluttered baby bag on the
floor fishing out two BABY MONITORS

She sets one down beside Cali’s crib exits with the other

INT CORRIDOR LORRAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Renai heads down the corridor towards a bedroom

The baby monitor in her hand SPITS to life the mournful cry
of an infant emitting from it

Renai STARTS listening then heads back the way she came

INT CALI’S BEDROOM LORRAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Renai shuffles inside The crying on the monitor drains away
She FREEZES The crib is EMPTY

Alarmed Renai whips around the room stopping when she sees
her baby - asleep on the floor

Renai scoops up her daughter pressing her close An all too
familiar shiver of terror passes through her She backs out
of the room still clinging to the baby

INT SPARE BEDROOM LORRAINE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Renai is lying in bed awake glaring at Cali who is now
lying next to her Josh is awake too watching Renai

JOSH

Are you okay Do you want me to get
you a sleeping pill

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

No answer

JOSH (CONTD)
What are you thinking about

RENAL
Nothing

JOSH
It’s impossible to think about
nothing

She turns away annoyed by his probing

JOSH (CONT’D)
I keep staring at Dalton I can’t
believe we have our son back So
why are you so upset

RENAT
I’m upset because it’s not over
I’m upset because we have our son
back but there are a lot of
unanswered questions

JOSH
Such as
RENAT
What did you see in there
JOSH
I saw things you don’t want to know
about
RENAT

Yes I do I need to know
Josh exhales A long beat This is difficult for him

JOSH
It’s not a place where you see
anything It was dark Pitch black
Exactly the way Elise described
itlike a void There were people
in there They were screaming
crying Stuck living out their worst
moments on a loop It was a place
for people who died in a terrible
way

RENAL
Like Elise

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

JOSH
I don’t know what happened to her
Renai

RENAT

Yeah you said that The police
asked me if I believed you

JOSH
And what did you say

Josh reaches for her hand and she flinches getting up

JOSH (CONTD)
Okay Alright Let’s just get it
all out there Let me answer all
the accusations you’re lying awake
‘not thinking’ about I didn’t do
it okay I didn’t kill Elise Why
would I How could I do that

Josh approaches her and she backs away

JOSH (CONTD)
What exactly is it that you think
happened Renai Tell me that Tell
me your version of events

RENAL
That old woman in the photo

JOSH
What about it I don’t know how it
got there I don’t know why she
showed up in pictures of me as a
kid and I don’t know now

Renai still doesn’t seem convinced

JOSH (CONTD)
We invited some extremely evil
things into our house that night
and one of those things murdered
Elise It’s as simple as that You
saw them too You saw things that
cannot be explained rationally and
now you want to explain Elise’s
death rationally Well it can’t be
done

He grips her by the shoulders

JOSH (CONT’D)
Look at me Look in my eyes

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

She drills his eyes inches from his face

JOSH (CONT’D)
It’s me You know it’s me I swear
on our children’s lives You have
to believe me or we can’t go on
from this point right now Do you
believe me

The moment hangs in the air A long beat until Renai breaks

RENAI
Yes

She collapses into him and they entwine

EXT ELISE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Specs and Tucker stand outside a modest house

They are not wearing white shirts and ties instead more
casually dressed in T-shirts

Specs approaches the front door letting a batch of keys fall
out of an envelope He rivets one of them into the lock
opening the door

There is some mail at his feet He scoops it up It is
addressed to Elise Rainier

INT LIVING ROOM ELISE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Specs taps a switch and recessed lighting gives a gentle
ambience to a room full of quirky fun bric-a-brac There is
a vintage pinball machine wedged into one corner

Specs moves past a table cluttered with photos Many shots
are of Elise with the two of them He picks one of them up

SPECS
All the stuff we’ve seen the
ghostsI feel like that should be
a comfort somehow like we have
firsthand knowledge that there’s
something else That she’s still
with us But it’s not Turns out
the living version of someone is
always better

TUCKER
Except for maybeHitler

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

SPECS
What

TUCKER
Id prefer ghost Hitler to the
living version It’s not always
better

SPECS
You’re sick

TUCKER
I’m just sayingtechnically

Specs places the photo down Tucker moves to a door on the
far side of the room He fishes through the keys trying
several in the lock One after the other Then -- CLICK

Specs prods the door It whines open and stabs a blade of
light onto a short set of steps that descend into murk

SPECS
You first

TUCKER
Hunter ninja bear

SPECS
Hurry up

Tucker descends the steps to another door opening it

INT READING ROOM ELISE’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Draped immediately behind the door there is a curtain

Tucker parts it shuffling into a large dark room with a
small card table at the center flanked by four chairs

A hanging lamp dangles above the table which is covered by
red TABLE CLOTH Tucker flicks a switch and the lamp gives
off a pale glow revealing a deck of TAROT CARDS fanned out
on the cloth

This room is also filled with bric-a-bracbut not of the

of a FIGURE Standing behind Lorraine Shrouded in shadow

Lorraine turns her head slowlyvery slowly
As she turns her head the figure walks away disappearing
Lorraine glowers into the dark She reaches over and flicks

the bedside lamp on It is bright enough to light the whole
bedroom

She takes a deep breath and gets up marching to the door A
PITCH BLACK corridor extends beyond the door Inky black

She reaches into the dark groping for the hallway light

Deathly quiet Lorraine’s fingers find the switch The light
comes on The corridor is empty

She leaves the light on

The curtain dances in the breeze the bathroom window open
Lorraine glances up at her reflection

In the mirror she sees a figure is standing in the corridor

facing the wall

Lorraine freezes with terror Keeping quiet Very slowly she
turns away from the mirror to face the door We TRACK WITH
HER following her eyes to see that the figure is still
standing there This was no illusion

The figure looks like a woman in a short dirty night gown
Modern not Victorian Her scraggly oily blonde hair coils
down her back She presses her forehead against the wall of
the corridor

Lorraine’s eyes are locked on the woman The woman appears to
be holding A BABY The baby has PALE DEAD SKIN

The woman turns her head glaring over her shoulder at Renai
Eyes like portals into Hell The woman’s skin is wrinkled

The bathroom door groans as the breeze from outside pushes it
closed blocking Lorraine’s view of the woman

Lorraine takes a step towards the door Then another She
grips the handleand opens the door

It creaks openvery slowly --

Josh as a child An old woman She
wanted to lure Josh out into the

Josh was hypnotized searching for
Dalton she may have finally gotten
what she wanted

bed (we are seeing a repeat of last nights scene)

Dalton stares at her paralyzed She leans over and pecks his
arm with a kiss Seems not to know that Dalton is awake

LORRAINE
Please don’t leave us again

From Dalton’s POV we see a figure STANDING BEHIND Lorraine
draped in shadow Dalton’s eyes are FILLED WITH TERROR

DALTON (VO)
I could see someone else in my
room I told her

DALTON
There’s someone standing behind
you Grandma
Lorraine turns her head flooded with fear The figure leaves

was in my room

Josh’s ear We see that the figure is a woman - THE SAME

passing the entrance to the LIVING ROOM

Inside the living room on the far side of the room we can
see a WOMAN holding a baby her back to us

She sees the figure pacing soothing the infant

again the woman is pacing around in the corner

The woman steps out of view Renai approaches Slowly
Quietly

When she reaches the corner where the woman lurked there is
no sign of her

All is mute Though it is daytime the room is darker

Renai steps into the center of the living room and we TRACK
AROUND HER There is no sign of the woman

We STOP TRACKING AROUND RENAI seeing her from the back
For a moment all we can hear is Renai’s breathing --

-- UNTIL A HIDEOUS WOMAN STEPS OUT TO THE SIDE FROM RIGHT IN
FRONT OF RENAI CLUTCHING A PALE BABY IN ONE ARM

WOMAN
Don’t you dare

The woman SLAPS Renai across the face with POTENT FORCE
Renai REELS BACK stunned spilling onto the floor (IT IS
THE WOMAN THAT LORRAINE SAW IN THE HALLWAY)

Renai HOWLS whipping her head back and SEEING NO ONE The
woman is gone

Dalton rushes in alarmed by her shriek The back door opens
and Josh barrels inside

RENAL
I saw one of those things again -

A long beat of nothing Finally
JOSH (CONTD)
Are you there

We CIRCLE AROUND Josh No response comes forth

JOSH (CONT’D)

asthmatic whistling through phlegm

Josh turns his eyes landing on a PAIR OF FEET visible below
the lace curve of the curtains A FIGURE is hiding there

Josh approaches the figure He is calm Stops short in front
of the curtain Keeping a safe distance head bowed

JOSH (CONT’D)
What do you want

An EYE peeks out from behind the curtain - a blackened bulb of
despair glaring at Josh We hear A VOICE A whisper dragged
through gravel

They wander Specs and Tucker splitting off examining
different rooms Some sunlight streams in but there are also
darker sections without windows We stay with Lorraine and
Carl as they roam the halls

They round a corner facing another long corridor They
shuffle down it Lorraine is melancholy flooded with memory

This is kind of overwhelming I
walked up and down these hallways
for a long time spending every

people from dying I thought I was
doing good

Now I’m under attack from the other
side From the dead It makes me
question if I did something wrong
How did I bring this on my family
Why won’t they leave us alone

You didn’t do anything wrong The
fact that you’re a good person is
what draws them to you They want
to corrupt that But they can’t

All is quiet Lorraine opens a door glaring into a long

Yes Still a fan

Carl nods He gets up moving to the wall of photos As he
passes Possessed Josh Carl grabs his arm

CARL
Haven’t lost that arm

POSSESSED JOSH
Not one bit

Carl looks into his eyes then lets go and moves to the wall
of photographs He zeroes in on the SAME PHOTO Elise studied
when she first visited this house When he is out of
Possessed Joshs line of sight his expression melts into one
of fear

POSSESSED JOSH (CONTD)
Would you like a coffee I’m making
one for myself

CARL
Sure absolutely

Possessed Josh leaves the room When he does Carl quietly
unzips the shoulder bag he is carrying and removes a CAMERA

WHAP
With sudden shocking violence a black garbage bag is
wrapped around Carl’s face He flails clawing at the bag

sucking in air

Possessed Josh wrenches Carl to the floor tightening the bag
around his throat twisting it Madness in his eyes Grinning

Carl kicks out scratching at Possessed Josh’s fingers - but
Josh is too strong

Carl spasms his resistance slowinguntil he shudders with
a final breath and is still

stands up locking the front door then fishes through Carl’s
pockets for his car keys

He finds them leaves the room He returns with blankets
wrapping them around Carls corpse

He spies through the drapes seeing Carl’s car parked in the
driveway

He hefts Carl’s body up his spine cracking with the effort
opening the door and limping outside The door closes

-- The Further
A cold midnight version of Lorraine’s house

Carl is standing in the center of the room dressed as he was
when he died He is shell-shocked frightened A lost child

He sees a dark FIGURE approaching from the kitchen The
figure holds up a bright lantern illuminating his face

It is Josh He steps close to Carl

CARL
Ive been here beforebut I was
never afraid of this place until
now

JOSH

Now there’s no going back
Understand

Carl nods shaken

CARL

She murdered you and she’s going to
do the same to my family

Carl moves to the door opening it and unveiling an infinite
darkness

CARL
Into the further we go

They step through the door

EXT BLACK VOID - NIGHT (THE FURTHER)

Darkness closes in around Josh and Carl like a suffocating
blanket

They stagger forward not knowing which direction to head in
There is nothing in front of them Josh whirls and stares
back at the house the lantern held out in front of him

They lurch on through the unfolding nothingness

The sounds of this world are a muffled aural cacophony
Distant SCREAMS distorted and tortured The whinny’s and
snorts of ANIMALS The wheeze of asthmatic BREATHING - all of
it swirling together in the distance as if coming through a
tinny faraway speaker

CARL
Elise

The cry echoes back to them

JOSH
Elise

Thena figure looms in the distance A man standing alone
Staring at them They approach

The man is unmoving His unblinking eyes pivot between the
two of them

CARL
We’re looking for Elise Where is
she

The man doesn’t answer His fingers shake Finally he points
over their shoulders behind them

They turn - AND JOLT

A huge horde of pale figures is crowded behind Josh and Carl
The figures reach out with gnarled fingers

Josh and Carl stagger back - hitting another wall of figures

THEY ARE SURROUNDED

The figures rip and tear at Josh

JOSH
Get away from me Get away

And then - the entities suddenly SCREAM

A BLINDING LIGHT casts over them They react to the light as
if it were fire

The sea of dead parts retreating into the darkness The
light flickers and dies downa FIGURE EMERGING FROM IT

IT IS ELISE She is glowing with an inner light of her own
Her and Josh embrace lingering long on the hug

ELISE
I wish I could say it’s good to see
you

JOSH
I’m sorry

more than most I chose to make my
living by dabbling in a dangerous

She raises the camera pointing it at Josh

She depresses the trigger The flash ignites lighting the
whole room Renai checks the viewing window --

On it she sees an EMPTY BED Josh is no longer there

Renai backs up in the dark She holds up the camera again
hitting the button The flash explodes again

This time on the viewing window there is a FACE FILLING THE
SCREEN - A HYBRID OF JOSH’S FACE AND THE OLD WOMAN’S (there
is less of the Old Woman transposed over his face than there
was before - SHE IS SLOWLY TAKING OVER assimilating with
him)

Renai looks up - coming FACE TO FACE with Possessed Josh
Renai staggers away from him

POSSESSED JOSH

I wanted to stay so much longer
the feeling of being alive again
You cannot comprehend how good it
feels To breathe To eat All the
little things that you brush off
like a fly But she wanted me to
kill you

Possessed Josh shakes his head tears in his eyes scratching

forearm

The demon reaches out with taloned fingers gripping the door
handle and opening the door

Josh steps inside

INT YOUNG PHILIP’S BEDROOM (THE FURTHER)

The same bedroom that Carl first explored reveals itself The
same eloquent dollhouse’s and child’s drawings

It is obviously the bedroom of a young girl Josh’s eyes
sweep the room coming to rest on the young girl in question

She sits with her back to Josh slumped on a stool facing
the wall

Her hair is long and combed into twin pig-tails Her dress is
decorated with fanciful trimmings Her feet dangle above the
floor Josh approaches the young girl very slowly

The girl doesn’t move He reaches out to touch her shoulder

JOSH
Michelle

The girl suddenly SPINS around -- revealing that it is NOTA
GIRL AT ALL It is a young boy bedecked in a dress

YOUNG BOY
That’s not my name

He rips at a wig on his head revealing his true hair THEN --

-- the door to the bedroom POUNDS open MICHELLE barges
inside the room She is dressed in a very prim and proper
fashion but her expression belies rage

She seems not to see Josh and the others her gaze fixed on
the boy The boy looks terrified backing away from her
Michelle clenches a sheet of paper which she juts out at him
with her fist

MICHELLE
What is this Just what is this

The boy bumps into the wall unable to back up any further
Michelle looms over him She unfurls the piece of paper
revealing it to be a FINGER PAINTING

MICHELLE (CONTD)
Did you do this

The boy keeps his eyes down The woman slaps him

She slaps him again and he cries

starved shapes His bones cracking His spine elongating

His jaw distends and his mouth opens WIDE A sound ROARS from

An agonizing wait as Josh arches forward gathering his
breath spitting and coughing He finally calms the fit of

Specs wanders back to Tucker’s van carrying Tucker’s goggles

He pries open the back of the van climbing up onto the lip
and slotting the flashlights back into their allotted case

And then he stops Because he hears something Brow furrowed
he trains his ears on it A low hissy whisper

Intrigued he ransacks the mess stacked in the van He
finally lands on the GAS MASK device

The whispering is coming from the headphones attached to it

Specs lifts them to his earshearing a slight barely
audible hiss A singular voice swims within the white noise

She halts when she spies a sheet hiding a large object in the
middle of the room a bow adorning it She approaches the
object seeing a card addressed to her

She tears open the envelope plucking out a small card
Inside the scrawled handwriting says ‘WILL THIS DO FOR NOW’

Renai hauls back the sheet - unveiling a BABY PIANO She
beams pulling up a chair and plopping down on it She lets
her fingers dance across the keys tapping out a melody Josh
approaches her from behind and she looks up
