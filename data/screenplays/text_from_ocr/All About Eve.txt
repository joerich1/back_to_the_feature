FADE IN
INT DINING HALL - SARAH SIDDONS SOCIETY - NIGHT

It is not a large room and jammed with tables mostly for
four but some for six and eight A long table of honor for
about thirty people has been placed upon a dais

Diner is over Demi-tasses cigars and brandy The overall
effect is one of worn elegance and dogged gentility It is
June

The CAMERA as it has been throughout the CREDIT TITLES is
on the SARAH SIDDONS AWARD It is a gold statuette about a
foot high of Sarah Siddons as The Tragic Muse Exquisitely
framed in a nest of flowers it rests on a miniature altar in
the center of the table of honor

Over this we hear the crisp cultured precise VOICE of
ADDISON deWITT

ADDISONS VOICE
The Sarah Siddons Award for
Distinguished Achievement is
perhaps unknown to you It has been
spared the sensational and
commercial publicity that attends
such questionable honors as the
Pulitzer Prize and those awards
presented annually by the film
society

The CAMERA has EASED BACK to include some of the table of
honor and a distinguished gentleman with snow-white hair who
is speaking We do not hear what he says

ADDISONS VOICE
The distinguished looking gentleman
is an extremely old actor Being an
actor - he will go on speaking for
some time It is not important what
you hear what he says

The CAMERA EASES BACK some more and CONTINUES until it
discloses a fairly COMPREHENSIVE SHOT of the room

ADDISONS VOICE
However it is important that you
know where you are and why you are
here This is the dining room of
the Sarah Siddons Society
The occasion is its annual banquet
and presentation of the highest
honor our Theater knows - the Sarah
Siddons Award for Distinguished
Achievement
A GROUP OF WAITERS are clustered near the screen masking the
entrances of the kitchen The screens are papered with old
theatrical programs The waiters are all aged and venerable
They look respectfully toward the speaker

ADDISONS VOICE
These hollowed walls indeed many
of these faces have looked upon
Modjeska Ada Rehan and Minnie
Fiske Mansfields voice filled the
room Booth breathed this air It
is unlikely that the windows have
been opened since his death

CLOSE - THE AWARD on its altar it shines proudly above five
or six smaller altars which surround it and which are now
empty

ADDISONS VOICE
The minor awards as you can see
have already been presented Minor
awards are for such as the writer
and director - since their function
is merely to construct a tower so
that the world can applaud a light
which flashes on top of it and no
brighter light has ever dazzled the

eye than Eve Harrington Eve but
more of Eve later All about Eve
in fact

THE CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSE - ADDISON deWITT not young not
unattractive a fastidious dresser sharp of eye and
merciless of tongue An omnipresent cigarette holder projects
from his mouth like the sward of DArtagnan

He sits back in his chair musingly his fingers making
little cannonballs out of bread crumbs His narration covers
the MOVE of the CAMERA to him

ADDISONS VOICE
To those of you who do not read
attend the Theater listen to
uncensored radio programs or know
anything of the world in which we
live - it is perhaps necessary to
introduce myself My name is
Addison deWitt
My native habitat is the Theater -
in it I toil not neither do I
spin I am a critic and
commentator I am essential to the
Theater - as ants are to a picnic
as the ball weevil to a cotton
field

He looks to his left KAREN RICHARDS is lovely and thirtyish
in an unprofessional way She is scraping bread crumbs
spilled sugar etc into a pile with a spoon Addison takes
one of her bread crumbs She smiles absently Addison rolls
the bread crumb into a cannonball

ADDISONS VOICE
This is Karen Richards She is the
wife of a playwright therefore of
the Theater by marriage Nothing in
her background or breeding should
have brought her any closer the
stage than row E center

Karen continues her doodling

ADDISONS VOICE

however during her senior year
in Radcliffe Lloyd Richards
lectured on drama The following
year Karen became Mrs Lloyd
Richards Lloyd is the author of
Footsteps on the Ceiling - the
play which has won for Eve
Harrington the Sarah Siddons
Award

Karen absently pats the top of her little pile of refuse A
hand reaches in to take the spoon away Karen looks as the
CAMERA PANS with IT to MAX FABIAN He sits at her left Hes
a sad-faced man with glasses and a look of constant
apprehension He smiles apologetically and indicated a white
powder with he unwraps He pantomimes that his ulcer is
snapping

Karen smiles back returns to her doodling Addison mashes a
cigarette stub pops it out of his holder He eyes Max

ADDISONS VOICE
There are two types of theatrical
producers One has a great many
wealthy friends who will risk a tax
deductible loss This type is
interested in Art

Max drops the powder into some water stirs it drinks burps
delicately and close his eyes

ADDISONS VOICE
The other is one to whom each
production mean potential ruin or
fortune This type is out to make a
buck Meet Max Fabian He is the
producer of the play which has won
Eve Harrington the Sarah Siddons
Award

Max rests fitfully He twitches A hand reaches into the
SCENE removes a bottle of Scotch from before him The CAMERA
follows the bottle to MARGO CHANNING She sits at Maxs left
at deWitts right An attractive strong face She is
childish adult reasonable unreasonable - usually one when
she should be the other but always positive She pours a
stiff drink

Addison hold out the soda bottle to her She looks at it and
at him as if it were a tarantula and he had gone mad He
smiles and pours a glass of soda for himself

ADDISONS VOICE
Margo Channing is the Star of the
Theater She made her first stage
appearance at the age of four in
Midsummer Nights Dream She
played a fairy and entered - quite
unexpectedly - stark naked She has
been a Star ever since

Margo sloshes her drink around moodily pulls at it

ADDISONS VOICE
Margo is a great Star A true Star
She never was or will be anything
less or anything less
(slight pause)

the part for which Eve
Harrington is receiving the Sarah
Siddons Award was intended
originally for Margo Channing

Addison having sipped his soda water puts a new cigarette
in his holder leans back lights it looks and exhales in
the general direction of the table of honor As he speaks the
CAMERA MOVES in the direction of his glance

ADDISONS VOICE
Having covered in tedious detail
not only the history of the Sarah
Siddons Society but also the
history of acting since Thespis
first stepped out of the chorus
line - our distinguished chairman
has finally arrived at our reason
for being here

At this point Addisons voice FADES OUT and the voice of the
aged actor FADES IN CAMERA is in MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT of him
and the podium

AGED ACTOR
I have been proud and privileged to
have spent my life in the Theater -
a poor player that struts and
frets his hour upon the stage -
and I have been honored to be for
forty years Chief Promoter of the
Sarah Siddons Society
(he lifts the Sarah

Siddons
altar)

Award from its

Thirty-nine times have I placed in

deserving hands

this highest honor

the Theater knows
(he grows a bit arch he
uses his eyebrows)

Surely no actor

is older than I - I

have earned my place out of the

sun

(indulgent laughter)

and never before has this Award
gone to anyone younger than its
recipient tonight How fitting that
it should pass from my hands to

hers

EVE HANDS Lovely beautifully groomed In serene repose
they rest between a demi-tasse cup and an exquisite small

evening cup

AGED ACTOR
Such young hands Such a young
lady Young in years but whose

heart is as old

as the Theater

Addisons eyes narrow quizzically as he listens Then
slowly he turns to look at Karen

AGED ACTOR
Some of us a privileged to know
her We have seen beyond the beauty

and artistry-

Karen never ceases her thoughtful pat-a-cake with the crumbs

AGED ACTOR

-that have made

her name resound

through the nation We know her
humility Her devotion her loyalty

to her art

Addisons glance moves from Karen to Margo

AGED ACTOR
Her love her deep and abiding love

for us-

Margos face is a mask
cradles with both hands

She looks down at the drink which she

AGED ACTOR
-for what we are and what we do
The Theater She has had one wish
one prayer one dream To belong to
us

(hes nearing his curtain

line)
Tonight her dream has come true
And henceforth we shall dream the
same of her

(a slight pause)
Honored members ladies and
gentlemen - for distinguished
achievement in the Theater - the
Sarah Siddons Award to Miss Eve
Harrington

The entire room is galvanized into sudden and tumultuous
applause Some enthusiastic gentlemen rise to her feet
Flash bulbs start popping about halfway down the table of the
Aged Actors left

Eve rises - beautiful radiant poised exquisitely gowned
She stands in simple and dignified response to the ovation

A dozen photographers skip squat and dart about like water
bugs Flash bulbs pop and pop and pop

THE WAITERS applaud enthusiastically

AGED ACTOR Award in hand he beams at her

EVE smiles sweetly to her left then to her right

MAX has come to He applauds lustily

ADDISONs applauding too more discreetly

MARGO not applauding But you sense no deliberate slight
merely an impression that as she looks at Eve her mind is on

something else

KAREN nor is she applauding But her gaze is similarly fixed
on Eve in a strange faraway fashion

ADDISON still applauding his eyes flash first at Margo and
then at Karen Then he directs them back to Eve He smiles
ever so slightly

The applause has continued unabated EVE turns now and moves
gracefully toward the Aged Actor She moves through
applauding ladies and gentlemen from below the flash bulbs
keep popping

As she nears her goal the Ages Actor turns to her He holds
out the award Her hand reaches out for it At that precise
moment - with the award just beyond her fingertips - THE
PICTURE HOLDS THE ACTION STOPS The SOUND STOPS

ADDISONS VOICE
Eve Eve the Golden Girl The
cover girl the girl next door the
girl on the moon Time has been
good to Eve Life goes where she
goes - shes been profiled
covered revealed reported what
she eats and when and where whom
she knows and where she was and
when and where shes going

ADDISON has stopped applauding hes sitting forward staring
intently at Eve his narration continues unbroken

ADDISONS VOICE
Eve You all know all about
Eve what can there be to know
that you dont know

As he leans back the APPLAUSE FADES IN as tumultuous as
before Addisons look moves slowly from Eve to Karen

KAREN she leans forward now her eyes intently on Eve Her
lovely face FILLS THE SCREEN as the APPLAUSE FADES ONCE MORE -
as she thinks back

KARENS VOICE
When was it How long It seems a
lifetime ago Lloyd always said
that in the Theater a lifetime was
a season and a season a lifetime
Its June now That was - early
October only last October It
was a drizzly night I remember I
asked the taxi to wait

DISSOLVE TO

EXT NEW YORK THEATER STREET - NIGHT

Traffic is not heavy the shows have broken some half-hour
before The rain is just a drizzle

There are other theaters on the street display lights are
being extinguished Going out just as Karens taxi pulls up
is MARGO CHANNING in AGED IN WOOD The marquis display
below includes Max Fabian Presents and By Lloyd Richards

The taxi comes to a stop at the alley Karen can be seen
through the closed windows telling the driver to wait Then
she gets out She takes a step hesitates then looks about
curiously

KARENS VOICE
Where was she Strange I had
become so accustomed to seeing her
there night after night - I found
myself looking for a girl Id never
spoken to wondering where she
was

She smiles a little at her own romanticism puts her head
down and makes her way into the alley

EXT ALLEY - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT

Karen moves toward the stage door She passes a recess in the
wall - perhaps an exit - about halfway

EVES VOICE
(softly)
Mrs Richards

Karen hesitates looks Eve is barely distinguishable in the
shadow of the recess Karen smiles waits Eve comes out A
gooseneck light above them reveals her

She wears a cheap trench coat low-heeled shoes a rain hat
stuck on the back of her head Her large luminous eyes
seem to glow up at Karen in the strange half-light

KAREN
So there you are It seemed odd
suddenly your not being there

EVE
Why should you think I wouldnt be

KAREN
Why should you be After all six
nights a week - for weeks - of
watching even Margo Channing enter
and leave a theater-

EVE
I hope you dont mind my speaking
to you

KAREN
Not at all

EVE

Ive seen you so often - it took
every bit of courage I could raise-

KAREN
(smiles)
To speak to just a playwrights
wife Im the lowest form of
celebrity

EVE
Youre Margo Channings best
friend You and your husband are
always with her - and Mr
Sampson whats he like

KAREN
(grins)
Bill Sampson Hes - hes a
director

EVE
Hes the best

KAREN
Hell agree with you Tell me what
do you between the time Margo goes
in and comes out Just huddle in
that doorway and wait

EVE
Oh no I see the play

KAREN

(incredulous)
You see the play Youve seen the
play every performance

(Eve nods)
But dont you find it - I mean
apart from everything else - dont
you find it expensive

EVE
Standing room doesnt cost much I
manage

Karen contemplates Eve Then she takes her arm

KAREN
Im going to take you to Margo

EVE
(hanging back)
Oh no

KAREN
Shes got to meet you-

EVE
No Id be imposing on her Id be
just another tongue-tied gushing
fan

Karen practically propels her toward the stage door
KAREN
(insisting)
There isnt another like you there

couldnt be-

EVE
But if Id known maybe some
other time I mean looking like
this

KAREN
You look just fine
(theyre at the stage
door)
by the way Whats your name

EVE
Eve Eve Harrington

Karen opens the door They go in
INT BACKSTAGE - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT
Everything including the doorman looks fireproof

Eve enters like a novitiates first visit to the Vatican
Karen with a Good evening Gus - to the doorman leads the
way toward Margos stage dressing room Eve drinking in the
wonderment of all the surveys lags behind Karen waits for
her to catch up

EVE
You can breathe it - cant you
Like some magic perfume

Karen smiles takes Eves arm They proceed to Margos
dressing room

EXT MARGOS DRESSING ROOM - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT

No star on the closed door the paint is peeling A type
written chit thumbtacked says MISS CHANNING

As Karen and Eve approach it an uninhibited guffaw from
Margo makes them pause

KAREN
(whispers)
You wait a minute
(smiles)
- now dont run away-

Eve smiles shakily At the same moment

MARGOS VOICE
(loudly through the door)
Honey chile I said if the
South had won the war you could
write the same plays about the
North

Karen enters during the line
INT MARGOS DRESSING ROOM - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT

It is a medium-sized box lined with hot water pipes and
cracked plaster It is furnished in beat-up wicker A door
leads to an old-fashioned bathroom

Margo is at the dressing table She wears an old wrapper her
hair drawn back tightly to fit under the wig which lies
before her like a dead poodle Also before her is an almost
finished drink

LLOYD RICHARDS is stretched out on the wicker chaise Hes in
his late thirties sensitive literate

Between them by the dressing table is BIRDIE - Margos
maid Her age is unimportant She was conceived during a
split week in Walla Walla and born in a carnival riot She is
fiercely loyal to Margo

Karen enters during the line Margo started while she was
outside Lloyd chuckles Birdie cackles

KAREN
Hi
(she goes to kiss Lloyd)
Hello darling-

MARGO

(she goes right on - ina

think Suthn accent)
Well now Mis Channin ah dont
think you can rightly say we lost
the wah we was mo stahved out
you might say - an thats what ah
don unnerstand about all these
plays about love-stahved Suthn
women - love is one thing we was
nevah stahved for the South

LLOYD
How was the concert

KAREN
Loud

BIRDIE
Lemme fix you a drink

KAREN
No thanks Birdie

Karen laughs with them
LLOYD

Margos interview with a lady
reporter from the South-
BIRDIE
The minute it gets printed theyre
gonna fire on Gettysburg all over
again

MARGO
It was Fort Sumter they fired on-

BIRDIE
I never played Fort Sumter

She takes the wig into the bathroom Margo starts creaming
the make-up off her face

MARGO
Honey chili had a point You know
I can remember plays about women -
even from the South - where it
never even occurred to them whether
they wanted to marry their fathers
more than their brothers

LLOYD
That was way back

MARGO
Within your time buster Lloyd
honey be a playwright with guts
Write me one about a nice normal
woman who shoots her husband

Birdie comes out of the bathroom without the wig

BIRDIE
You need new girdles

MARGO
Buy some

BIRDIE
The same size

MARGO
Of course

BIRDIE
Well I guess a real tight girdle
help when youre playin a lunatic

She picks up Lloud empty glass asks more He shakes his
head She pours herself a quick one

KAREN
(firmly)
Margo does not play a lunatic
Birdie
BIRDIE
I know She just keeps hearin her
dead father play the banjo

MARGO
Its the tight girdle that does it

KAREN
I find these wisecracks
increasingly less funny Aged in
Wood happens to be a fine and
distinguished play-

LLOYD
- tats my loyal little woman

KAREN
The critics thought so the
audiences certainly think so -
packed houses tickets for months
in advance - I cant see that
either of Lloyds last two plays
have hurt you any

LLOYD
Easy now

MARGO
(grins)
Relax kid Its only me and my big
mouth

KAREN
(mollified)
Its just that you get me so mad
sometimes of all the women in

the world with nothing to complain
about-

MARGO
(dryly)
Aint it the truth

KAREN
Yes it is Youre talented
famous wealthy - people waiting
around night after night just to
see you even in the wind and
rain

MARGO
Autograph fiends Theyre not
people - those little beast who run
in packs like coyotes-

KAREN
There is

Theyre your fans your audience-

MARGO
Theyre nobodys fans Theyre
juvenile delinquents mental
detectives theyre nobodys
audience they never see a play or
a movie even - theyre never
indoors long enough

a pause Lloyd applauds lightly

KAREN
Well theres one indoors now
Ive brought her back to see you

MARGO
Youve what

KAREN
(in a whisper)
Shes just outside the door

MARGO
(to Birdie also a
whisper)

The heave-ho

Birdie starts Karen stops her Its all in whisper
until Eve comes in

KAREN
You cant put her out I
promised Margo youve got to

see her she worships you its
like something out of a book-

LLOYD
That book is out of print Karen
those days are gone
Fans no longer pull the carriage
through the streets - they tear off
clothes and steal wrist watches

KAREN
If youd only see her youre her
whole life - you must have spotted
her by now shes always there

MARGO
Kind of mousy trench coat and funny
hat
(Karen nods)
How could I miss her Every night
and matinee - well

She looks to Birdie

now
BIRDIE
Once George Jessel played my
hometown For a girl gettin

in to

see him was easy Gettin out was

the problem

They all laugh Karen goes to the door

opens it Eve comes

in Karen closes the door behind her A moment

EVE
(simply)
I thought youd forgotten abou

KAREN
Not at all
(her arm through Eves)
Margo this is Eve Harrington

t me

Margo changes swiftly into a first-lady-of-the-theater

manner

MARGO
(musically)
How do you do my dear

BIRDIE
(mutters)
Oh brother
EVE

Hello Miss Channing

KAREN
My husband

LLOYD
(nicely)
Hello Miss Harrington

EVE
How do you do Mr Richards

MARGO
(graciously)
And this is my good friend and
companion Miss Birdie Coonan

BIRDIE
Oh brother

MARGO
Miss Coonan

LLOYD

(to Birdie)
Oh brother what
BIRDIE

When she gets like this all of a
sudden shes playin Hamlets
mother

MARGO

(quiet menace)
Im sure you must have things to do
in the bathroom Birdie dear

BIRDIE
If I havent Ill find something
till youre normal

She goes into the bathroom
MARGO

Dear Birdie Wont you sit down
Miss Worthington

KAREN
Harrington

MARGO
Im so sorry Harrington Wont
you sit down

EVE

Thank you
She sits A short lull

MARGO
Would you like a drink Its right
beside you

KAREN
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about
how often youd seen the play

They start together and stop in deference to each other
Theyre a little flustered But not Eve

EVE
(to Margo)
No thank you
(to Lloyd)
Yes Ive seen every performance

LLOYD
(delighted)
Every performance Then - am I safe
in assuming you like it

EVE
Id like anything Miss Channing
played

MARGO
(beams)
Would you really How sweet-

LLOYD
(flatly)
I doubt very much that youd like
her in The Hairy Ape

EVE
Please dont misunderstand me Mr
Richards I think that part of Miss
Channings greatness lies in her
ability to choose the best plays
your new play is for Miss Channing
isnt it Mr Richards

MARGO
Of course it is

LLOYD
Howd hear about it

EVE
There was an item in the Times i
like the title Footsteps on the
Ceiling’

LLOYD
Lets get back to this one Have
you really seen every performance
(Eve nods)
Why Im curious

Eve looks at Margo then drops her eyes

EVE
Well If I didnt come to see the
play I wouldnt have anywhere else
to go

MARGO
There are other plays

EVE
Not with you in them Not by Mr
Richards

LLOYD

But you must have friends a
family a home-

Eve pauses Then shakes her head

KAREN
Tell us about it - Eve

Eve looks at her - grateful because Karen called her Eve
Then away again

EVE
If I only knew how

KAREN
Try

EVE
Well

Birdie comes out of the bathroom Everybody looks at her
sharply She realizes shes in on something important She
closes the door quietly leans against it

EVE
Well it started with the play
before this one

LLOYD
Remembrance

MARGO
Did you see it here in New York

EVE
San Francisco It was the last
week I went one night the most
important night in my life - until
this one Anyway I found myself
going the next night - and the next
and the next Every performance
Then when the show went East - I
went East

BIRDIE
Ill never forget that blizzard the
night we played Cheyenne A cold
night First time I ever saw a
brassiere break like a piece of
matzos

Eve looks at her unsmilingly then back to her hands

KAREN
Eve why dont you start at the
beginning

EVE

It couldnt possibly interest you

MARGO
Please
Eve speaks simply and without self-pity

EVE
I guess it started back home
Wisconsin that is There was just
mum and dad - and me I was the
only child and I made believe a
lot when I was a kid - I acted out
all sorts of things what they
were isnt important But somehow
acting and make-believe began to
fill up my life more and more it
got so that I couldnt tell the
real from the unreal except that
the unreal seemed more real to
me Im talking a lot of
gibberish arent I

LLOYD
Not at all

EVE
Farmers were poor in those days
thats what dad was - a farmer I
had to help out So I quit school
and I went to Milwaukee I became a
secretary In a brewery

(she smiles)
When youre a secretary ina
brewery - its pretty hard to make
believe youre anything else
Everything is beer It wasnt much
f£
t

T

un but it helped at home - and
ere was a Little Theater Group
ike a drop of rain in the desert
ats where I met Eddie He was a
radio technician We played
Liliom for three performances I
was awful - then the war came and
we got married Eddie was in the
air force - and they sent him to
the South Pacific You were with
the OWI werent you Mr
Richards

(Lloyd nods)
Thats what Whos Who says
well with Eddie gone my life went
back to beer Except for a letter a
week One week Eddie wrote he had a
leave coming up Id saved my money
and vacation time I went to San
Francisco to meet him

(a slight pause)
Eddie wasnt there They forwarded
the telegram from Milwaukee - the
one that came from Washington to
say that Eddie wasnt coming at

all That Eddie was dead
(Karen puts her hand on
Lloyds)

- so I figured Id stay in San
Francisco i was alone but
couldnt go back without Eddie I
found a job And his insurance
helped and there were theaters
in San Francisco And one night
Margo Channing came to play in
Remembrance and I went to see
it And - well - here I am

She finishes dry-eyes and self-composed Margo squeezes the
bridge of her nose dabs at her eyes

BIRDIE
(finally)
What a story Everything but the
bloodhounds snappin at her rear
end

That breaks the spell Margo turns to her-

MARGO

There are some human experiences
Birdie that do not take place ina
vaudeville house - and that even a
fifth-rate vaudevillian should
understand and respect

(to Eve)
I want to apologize for Birdies-

BIRDIE
(snaps in)
You dont have to apologize for me
(to Eve)
Im sorry if I hurt your feelings
Its just my way of talkin

EVE
(nicely)
You didnt hurt my feelings Miss
Coonan

BIRDIE
Call me Birdie
(to Margo)
As for bein fifth-rate - i closed
the first half for eleven years an
you know it

She slams into the bathroom again At that precise instant
BILL SAMPSON flings open the door to the dressing room Hes
youngish vital undisciplined He lugs a beat-up suitcase
which he drops as he crosses to Margo-
BILL
Forty-five minutes from now my
plane takes off and how do I find
you Not ready yet looking like a
junk yard-

MARGO
Thank you so much

BILL

nothing to you Have you no human
consideration

MARGO

KAREN
(conscious of Eve)

BILL

Bill flashes a fleeting look at Eve

BILL

BIRDIE

BILL
Take your mistress into the
bathroom and dress her

Without comment

Birdie shuts it and goes into the bathroom In a moment we
hear a shower start to run Eve gets up

KAREN

EVE

to say how its been
MARGO
(rises)
No dont go

MARGO
Stick around Please Tell you what

plane you and I then go somewhere

EVE
Well - if Im not in the way

MARGO

She darts into the bathroom Eve sits down again

KAREN

Lloyd gets up Karen crosses to pound on the bathroom door
She yells - the shower is going

KAREN

Margos answer is lost in the shower noise Karen crosses to
kiss Bill Shes joined by Lloyd

KAREN

BILL

open dressing room door

EVE

INT MARGOS DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Eve sits on the same chair Bill keeps moving around Eve
never takes her eyes off him He offers her a cigarette She
shakes her head He looks at his watch

EVE
You said forty-seven minutes
Youll never make it

BILL
(grins)
I told you a lie Well make it

conception of time than a halibut

He goes to the dressing table picks up Margos pocketbook
opens it He finds a letter He glances at it puts it back
BILL
Shes been carrying that letter
around for weeks Ive read it
three times

Theres a sudden sharp yelp from the bathroom

MARGOS VOICE
Youre supposed to zip the zipper -
not me

BIRDIES VOICE
Like tryin to zip a pretzel -
stand still

Bill grins

BILL
What a documentary those two would
make like the mongoose and the

cobra-
He sprawls on the chaise closes his eyes A pause
EVE
(finally)
So youre going to Hollywood

Bill grunts in the affirmative Silence

BILL
Why

EVE
I just wondered

BILL
Just wondered what

EVE
Why

BILL
Why what

EVE

Why you have to go out there

BILL
I dont have to I want to

EVE
Is it the money

BILL
Eighty percent of it will go for
taxes
EVE
Then why Why if youre the best
and most successful young director
in the Theater-

BILL

The Theatuh the Theatuh-

(he sits up)
- what book of rules says the
Theater exists only within some
ugly buildings crowded into one
square mile of New York City Or
London Paris or Vienna

(he gets up)
Listen junior And learn Want to
know what the Theater is A flea
circus Also opera Also rodeos
carnivals ballets Indian tribal
dances Punch and Judy a one-man
band - all Theater Wherever
theres magic and make-believe and
an audience - theres Theater
Donald Duck Ibsen and The Lone
Ranger Sarah Bernhardt Poodles
Hanneford Lunt and Fontanne Betty
Grable Rex and Wild and Eleanora
Duse You dont understand them
all you dont like them all why
should you The Theaters for
everybody - you included but not
exclusively - so dont approve or
disapprove It may not be your
Theater but its Theater of
somebody somewhere

EVE
I just asked a simple question

BILL
(grins)
And I shot my mouth off Nothing
personal junior no offense
(he sits back down)

its just that theres so much
bushwah in this Ivory Green Room
they call the Theatuh - sometimes
it gets up around my chin

He lies down again

EVE
But Hollywood You mustnt stay
there

BILL

(he closes his eyes)
Its only one picture deal

EVE
So few come back

BILL
Yeah They keep you under drugs out
there with armed guards

A pause
EVE
I read George Jean Nathan every
week
BILL

Also Addison deWitt

EVE
Every day

BILL
You didnt have to tell me

Margo putting on an earring buzzes out of the bathroom
followed by Birdie Bill sits up

MARGO
(en route)
I understand its the latest thing -
just one earring If it isnt its
going to be - I cant find the
other

She grabs her pocketbook starts rummaging Out comes the
letter

BILL
Throw that dreary thing away it
bores me-

Margo drops it in the wastebasket keeps rummaging

EVE
(concerned)
Where do you suppose it could be

BIRDIE
Itll show up

MARGO
(gives up)
Oh well
(to Birdie)

got caught-
BILL
Real diamonds in a wig The world

MARGO
(shes been looking)

BIRDIE
Right where you left it

She goes behind the chaise She comes up with a magnificent
mink

BILL
(to Margo)
The seams

Margo starts to straighten them

MARGO
(to Eve)
Cant keep his eyes off my legs

BILL
Like a nylon lemon peel-

MARGO
(straightens up)
Byron couldnt have said it more
graciously here we go-

By now shes in the coat and has Eves arm heading for the
door Bill puts his arms around Birdie

BILL
Got any messages What do you want
me to tell Tyrone Power

BIRDIE

Bill kisses her cheek She kisses Bill

BIRDIE

(nods)
See you home

Margo and Eve precede Bill out of the door

EXT LAGUARDIA FIELD - NIGHT
American Airlines baggage counter The rain has stopped but
its wet

Margo Eve and Bill are stymied behind two or three couples
waiting to be checked in Margos arm is through Bills They
become increasingly aware of their imminent separation Eve
senses her superfluity

A lull Bill cranes at the passenger heading the line in
earnest conversation with the dispatcher He sighs

MARGO
They have to time it so everybody
gets on at the last minute So they
can close the doors and let you
sit

The man up ahead moves on

BILL
Ah

EVE

I have a suggestion

(they look at her)
Theres really not much time left -
I mean you havent had a minute
alone yet and - well I could take
care of everything here and meet
you at the gate with the ticket
if youd like

BILL
I think wed like very much Sure
you wont mind

EVE
Of course not

Bill hands Eve the ticket Margo smiles gratefully at her
Eve smiles back

EXT PASSAGE AND GATE - LAGUARDIA - NIGHT

Its covered with glass windows Margos arm is in Bills

BILL
Shes quite a girl that whats-her
name

MARGO
Eve Id forgotten they grew that
way

BILL

The lack of pretense that sort of
strange directness and
understanding-

MARGO
Did she tell you about the Theater
and what it meant

BILL
(grins)
I told her I sounded off

MARGO
All the religions in the world
rolled into one and were Gods and
Goddesses isnt it silly
suddenly Ive developed a big
protective feeling for her - a lamb
loose in our big stone jungle

Bill pauses and pulls her to one side Some passengers go by
A pause

MARGO
Take care of yourself out there

BILL
I understand theyve got the
Indians pretty well in hand

MARGO
Bill
BILL
Huh
MARGO
Dont get stuck on some glamour
puss-
BILL
Ill try
MARGO

Youre not such a bargain you
know conceited and thoughtless and
messy-

BILL
Everybody cant be Gregory Peck

MARGO
- youre a setup for some gorgeous
wide-eyed young babe

BILL
How childish are you going to get
before you quit it
MARGO
I dont want to be childish Id
settle for just a few years-

BILL
(firmly)
And cut that out right now

MARGO
Am I going to lose you Bill Am I

BILL
As of this moment youre six years
old

He starts to kiss her stops when he becomes aware of
standing near them She has his ticket in her hand

EVE
All ready

She hands Bill his ticket they start toward the gate

INT BOARDING GATE - LAGUARDIA - NIGHT

Bill pauses en route to the plane

BILL
Hey - junior

Margo turns to look at him with Eve
BILL

Keep your eyes on her Dont let
her get lonely Shes a loose lamb

turns
in a jungle
Eve looks at Margo Margo smiles

EVE
Dont worry

Bill waves climbs aboard The door is closed behind him the
departure routine starts

Margo and eve turn to go They walk down the passage As they
walk Eve gently disengages her arm from Margos and puts it
comfortingly about her

MARGOS VOICE
That same night we sent for Eves
things her few pitiful

possessions she moved into the
little guest room on the top
floor

INT DINING HALL - NIGHT

MARGO slides her fingers reflectively up and down the sides
of the almost empty highball glass

MARGOS VOICE
she cried when she saw it - it
was so like her little room back
home in Wisconsin

ADDISON eyeing her quizzically He offers her the whiskey

MARGO shakes her head absently She looks down at her glass
again Then she raises her eyes to look at Eve

MARGOS VOICE
the next three weeks were out
of a fairy tale - and I was
Cinderella in the last act Eve
became my sister lawyer mother
friend psychiatrist and cop - the
honeymoon was on

INT MARGOS LIVING ROOM - DAY

Its one floor above street level A long narrow room
smartly furnished - including a Sarah Siddons Award

MARGOS NARRATIVE overlaps into the scene which is a SILENT
ONE

Eve sits at a smart desk She is just arranging a stack of
letters which she carries to Margo with a pen Margo sits
comfortably by the fire with a play script She hands the
scrips up to Eve shakes her head and holds her nose Eve
smiles takes the script hands Margo the letters to sign
Birdie comes in with a tea tray which she sets on a low table
before the fire

The phone rings

Birdie and Eve both go for it Eve gets there first By her
polite but negative attitude we know she is giving someone a
skillful brush-off

Birdie glares first at her then at Margo

Margo leans her head back closes her eyes blissfully
Birdie slams the double door to the landing on her way out
INT BACKSTAGE - CURRAN THEATER - DAY

From the wings The audience is never visible Eve in the
fg Margo and company taking a curtain call Tumultuous
applause the curtain falls The cast except for Margo and
two male leads walk off The curtain rises again

EVE watching and listening to the storm of applause Her
eyes shine she clasps and unclasps her hands

THE STAGE Eve again in the fg but closer Again the
curtain falls This time the two men go off Curtain rises on
Margo alone If anything the applause builds

EVE that same hypnotic look there are tears in her eyes
The curtain falls offscene then rises again -

MARGO the curtain falls again between her and CAMERA

BACKSTAGE the curtain just settling on the floor Margo
starts off

STAGE MANAGER
One more

MARGO
(shakes her head)
From now on its not applause -
just something to do till the
aisles get less crowded

She walks as she talks and winds up at Eve - still in the
wings Eves eyes are wet she dabs at her nose

MARGO
What - again

EVE
I could watch you play that last
scene a thousand times and cry
every time-
MARGO
(grins)
Performance number one thousand of
this one - if I play it that long -
will take place in a well-padded
booby hatch

She takes Eves arm they stroll toward her dressing room

EVE
I must say you can certainly tell
Mr Sampsons been gone a month

MARGO
You certainly can Especially if
youre me between now and tomorrow
morning

EVE
I mean the performance Except for
you youd think hed never even
directed it - its disgraceful the
way they change everything
around

MARGO
(smiles)
Well teachers away and actors
will be actors

EVE
During your second act scene with
your father Roger Ferradays
supposed to stay way upstage at the
arch Hes been coming closer down
every night

MARGO
When he gets too close Ill spit
in his eye

Theyre at her dressing room by now Margos been unhooking
her gown with Eves help They go in

INT MARGOS DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Its undergone quite a change A new carpet chintz covers
for the furniture new lampshades dainty curtains across the
filthy barred window

Birdie waits within Shes listening to a fight she shuts it
off as they enter

MARGO
(entering)
You bought the new girdles a size
smaller I can feel it

BIRDIE
Something maybe grew a size bigger

MARGO
When we get home youre going to
get into one of those girdles and
act for two and half hours

BIRDIE
I couldnt get into the girdle in
two an a half hours

Margos out of her wig and dress by now She gets into her
robe sits at the dressing table Eves on the chaise by the
discarded costume

EVE
You havent noticed my latest bit
of interior decorating

MARGO
(turns looks)
Well youve done so much whats
new
EVE

The curtains I made them myself

MARGO
They are lovely Arent they
lovely Birdie

BIRDIE
Adorable We now got everything a
dressing room needs except a
basketball hoop

MARGO
Just because you cant even work a
zipper It was very thoughtful
Eve and I appreciate it-

A pause Eve rises picking up Margos costume

EVE
While youre cleaning up Ill take
this to the wardrobe mistress-

MARGO
Dont bother Mrs Brownll be
along for it in a minute

EVE
No trouble at all
And she goes out with the costume Birdie opens her mouth
shuts it then opens it again

BIRDIE
If I may so bold as to say
something - did you ever hear the
word union

MARGO
Behind in your dues How much

BIRDIE
I havent got a union Im slave
labor

MARGO
Well

BIRDIE

But the wardrobe women have got
one And next to a tenor a
wardrobe woman is the touchiest
thing in show business-—

MARGO
(catching on)
Oh-oh
BIRDIE
Shes got two things to do - carry
clothes an press em wrong - an

just let anybody else muscle in
As she talks Margo hurries to the door and out after Eve
INT BACKSTAGE - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT
Margo pops out looks for Eve then stares in amazement
EVE near the wings She stands before a couple of cheval
mirrors set up for cast members She has Margos dress held
up against her body She turns this way and that bows as if
to applause - mimicking Margo exactly
MARGO watches her curiously Then she smiles
MARGO
(calling)
Eve-
EVE startled whips the gown away turns to Margo
MARGO smiles understandingly
MARGO

(quietly)
I think wed better let Mrs Brown
pick up the wardrobe
Wordlessly Eve brings it toward her
INT MARGOS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Margos asleep A bedside clock with a luminous dial reads 3
AM exactly The phone rings Her head comes up out of the
pillow she shakes it She fumbles switches on a lamp then
picks up the phone

BILLS VOICE
(a loud happy squawk)
Margo What a wonderful surprise

Margo jumps at his vehemence As she does so the SCREEN
WIPES DOWN DIAGONALLY LEFT TO RIGHT so that Margo remains in
the lower right-hand diagonal of the screen and Bill is
disclosed in the upper left He too is in bed reading His
clock says midnight

BILL
(continuing)

thing to do-

MARGO
(dazed)
Bill Have I gone crazy Bill

BILL

BILL

MARGO
(nods in agreement)

(mutters)

Margo hangs up Bill hangs up He replaces the phone picks
up his book SLOW WIPE until ONLY MARGO is on screen She
puts her phone away She gets a cigarette She lights it She
rolls over on her back

INT MARGOS BEDROOM - DAY

Margo is propped up in bed still reflective Birdie comes in
with her breakfast tray and a hi which gets a hi from
Margo She starts on some petty chores Margo takes a sip of
orange juice

MARGO
Birdie-

BIRDIE
Hmm

MARGO

You dont like Eve do you

BIRDIE
Do you want an argument or an
answer
MARGO
An answer
BIRDIE
No
MARGO
Why not
BIRDIE

Now you want an argument

MARGO
She works hard

BIRDIE
Night an day

MARGO
Shes loyal and efficient-

BIRDIE
Like an agent with one client

MARGO
She thinks only for me
(no answer from Birdie)
doesnt she

BIRDIE
(finally)
Well lets say she thinks only
about you anyway

MARGO
How do you mean that

Birdie stops whatever it is shes doing

BIRDIE
Ill tell you how Like - lets see
- like she was studyin you like
you were a play or a book or a set
of blueprints How you walk talk

MARGO
(breaks in sharply)
Im sure thats very flattering
Birdie and Im sure theres
nothing wrong with that

There is a sharp brisk knock Eve comes in Shes dressed in
a smart suit She carries a leather portfolio

EVE
Good morning

Margo says good morning Birdie says nothing Eve shows off
the suit proudly

EVE
Well - what do you think of my
elegant new suit

MARGO
Very becoming It looks better on
you than it did on me

EVE
(scoffs)
I can imagine you know all it
needed was some taking in here and
letting out there - are you sure
you wont want it yourself

MARGO
Quite sure I find it just a bit
too - too Seventeenish for me

EVE
(laughs)
Oh come now as though you were an
old lady Im on my way Is there

anything more youve thought of-

MARGO
Theres the script to go back to
the Guild-

EVE
Ive got it

MARGO
- and those checks or whatever it
is for the income tax man

EVE
Right here

MARGO
It seems I cant think of a thing
you havent thought of

EVE
(smile)
Thats my job
(she turns to go)
See you at tea time

MARGO
Eve
(Eve turns at the door)
by any chance did you place a
call from me to Bill for midnight
California time

EVE

(gasps)
Oh golly And I forgot to tell you-

MARGO
Yes dear You forgot all about it

EVE
Well I was sure youd want to of
course being his birthday and
youve been so busy these past few
days and last night I meant to
tell you before you went out with
the Richards - and I guess I was
asleep when you got home

MARGO
Yes I guess you were It - it was
very thoughtful of you Eve

EVE
Mr Sampsons birthday I certainly
wouldnt forget that Youd never
forgive me
(she smiles shyly)
As a matter of fact I sent hima
telegram myself

And shes gone Margo stares at the closed door Then at
Birdie Birdie without comment goes out Margo alone
looks down at her orange juice Absently she twirls it in
its bed of shaved ice

INT DINING HALL - SARAH SIDDONS SOCIETY - NIGHT

MARGO reflectively twirling her highball glass The applause
continues She lifts her glass to drink Her glance meets
Karens She raises the glass in a silent toast

KAREN smiles wanly at Margos toast Then the smile fades as
she looks reflectively back to Eve

KARENS VOICE
I saw Eve quite often after our
first meeting but we never really
talked again - until the party
Margo gave for Bill when he
returned from Hollywood

INT MARGOS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Its January The bed is littered with fur coats Through the
open door from the floor below the murmur of a party at a
late hour No hilarity

KARENS VOICE
Its always convenient at a party
to know the hostess well enough to
use her bedroom rather than go
where all the others have to go

Karen is making repairs at Margos dressing table Eve
enters carrying a magnificent sable coat which she drops on
the bed

KAREN
Now whos show up at this hour
Its time people went home - hold
that coat up
(Eve holds it up Karen
whistles)
whose is it

EVE
Some Hollywood movie star her
plane got in late

KAREN
Discouraging isnt it Women with
furs like that where it never gets
cold

EVE
Hollywood

KAREN
Tell me Eve - how are things with
you Happy

Eve melts into warmth She beams sits on the bed Karen has
spun around on the dressing table stool

EVE
There should be a new word for
happiness Being here with Miss
Channing has been - I just cant
say shes been so wonderful done
so much for me-

KAREN
(smiles)
Lloyd says Margo compensates for
underplaying on the stage by
overplaying reality
(she gets up gets her
coat)
next to that sable my new mink
seems like an old bedjacket
(throws it over her
shoulder)
youve done your share Eve
Youve worked wonders with Margo

She starts out

EVE
(hesitantly)
Mrs Richards

KAREN
(pauses smiles)
Karen

EVE
Karen
(she picks at the
coverlet)
isnt it awful Im about to
ask you for another favor - after
all youve already done

KAREN
(crosses to her)
Nobodys done so much Eve youve
got to stop thinking of yourself as
one of the Hundred Neediest

Cases what is it

EVE
Well Miss Channings affairs are
in such good shape there isnt

enough to keep me as busy as I
should be really - not that Ive
ever considered anything that would
take me away from her but the
other day - when I heard Mr Fabian
tell Miss Channing that her
understudy was going to have a
baby and theyd have to replace
her

She looks down at the coverlet once more

KAREN
you want to be Margos new
understudy
EVE
I dont let myself think about it
even-

(she looks up rises as

she speaks)
- but I do know the part so well
and every bit of the staging
thered be no need to break ina
new girl-

(suddenly afraid she

sits)
- but suppose I had to go on one
night To an audience that came to
see Margo Channing No I couldnt
possibly

KAREN
(laughs)
Dont worry too much about that
Margo just doesnt miss
performances If she can walk
crawl or roll - she plays

EVE
(nods proudly)
The show must go on

KAREN
No dear Margo must go on
(she sits beside Eve)
As a matter of fact I see no
reason why you shouldnt be Margos

understudy

EVE
Do you think Miss Channing would
approve

KAREN

I think she would cheer

EVE
But Mr Richards and Mr Sampson-

KAREN
Theyll do as theyre told

Eve smiles a little A pause

EVE
Then - would you talk to Mr Fabian
about it

KAREN
Of course

EVE
You wont forget it

KAREN
I wont forget

EVE
I seem to be forever thanking you
for something dont I

She hugs Karen leaves She nearly collides with Birdie on
her way in

BIRDIE
The bed looks like a dead animal
act Which one is sables

KAREN
(pointing)
But she just got here

BIRDIE
Shes on her way With half the men
in the joint
(she hold up the coat)
Its only a fur coat

KAREN
What did you expect - live sables

BIRDIE
A diamond collar gold sleeves -
you know picture people

They start out

KAREN
Bill says actors out there eat just
as infrequently as here-

BIRDIE
They can always grab oranges off
trees This you cant do in Times
Square

Through the open door we see them go down the stairs and out
of sight

INT SECOND FLOOR LANDING AND STAIRS - NIGHT

Karen and Birdie come down the stairs to Bill Max Addison
a blonde young lady named MISS CASWELL (Addisons protegee-of
the-moment) - and at the feet of Bill and Addison Eve
They are all seated on the steps

Birdie goes through and down the stairs to the first floor
Karen remains with the others

Addison is holding forth

ADDISON
Every now and then some elder
statesman of the Theater or cinema
assures the public that actors and
actresses are just plain folk
Ignoring the fact that their
greatest attraction to the public
is their complete lack of
resemblance to normal human beings

MISS CASWELL
(as Birdie and the sables
pass)
Now theres something a girl could
make sacrifices for

BILLS VOICE
And probably has

MISS CASWELL
Sable
MAX
(to Miss Caswell)
Did you say sable - or Gable

MISS CASWELL
Either one

ADDISON
It is senseless to insist that
theatrical folk in New York
Hollywood and London are no
different from the good people of
Des Moines Chillicothe and
Liverpool By and large we are
concentrated gatherings of
neurotics egomaniacs emotional
misfits and precocious children-

MAX
(to Bill)
Gable Why a feller like that dont
come East to do a play

BILL
(nods)
He must be miserable the life he
lives out there-

ADDISON
These so-called abnormalities -
theyre our stock in trade they
make us actors writers directors
et cetera in the first place-

MAX
Answer me this What makes a man
become a producer

ADDISON
What makes a man walk into a lion
cage with nothing but a chair

MAX
This answer satisfies me a hundred
percent

ADDISON
We all have abnormality in common
We are a breed apart from the rest
of the humanity we Theater folk
We are the original displaced
personalities

BILL
(laughs to Eve)
You dont have to read his column
tomorrow - you just heard it I
dont agree Addison

ADDISON
at happens to be your particular
bnormality

oH

BILL
I admit theres a screwball
lement in the Theater It sticks
ut its got spotlights on it and
brass band But it isnt basic
t isnt standard - if it were the
eater couldnt survive

HrHEoeOOdO

MISS CASWELL
(to a passing butler)
Oh waiter

The butler goes right by

ADDISON
That isnt a waiter my dear
Thats a butler

MISS CASWELL
Well I cant yell Oh butler
can I Maybe somebodys name is
Butler

ADDISON
You have a point An idiotic one
but a point

MISS CASWELL
I dont want to make trouble All I
want is a drink

MAX
(getting up)
Leave me get you one

MISS CASWELL
(pitching)
Oh thank you Mr Fabian

Max leaves with her empty glass

ADDISON
Well done I see your career rising
in the East like the sun
(to Bill)
you were saying

BILL
I was saying that the Theater is
nine-tenths hard work Work done
the hard way - by sweat
application and craftsmanship Ill
agree to this - that to be a good
actor actress or anything else in
the Theater means wanting to be
that more than anything else in the
world

EVE
(abruptly)
Yes Yes it does

BILL

(goes on)
It means concentration of ambition
desire and sacrifice such as no
other profession demands And
Ill agree that the man or woman
who accepts those terms cant be
ordinary cant be - just someone
To give so much for almost always
so little

Eve speaks almost unaware of what she says She looks at no
one in particular just off

EVE
So little So little did you say
Why if theres nothing else -
theres applause Its like - like
waves of love coming over the
footlights and wrapping you up
Imagine
To know every night that
different hundreds of people love
you they smile their eyes shine
- youve pleased them they want
you you belong Just that alone is
worth anything

She becomes aware of Addisons strange smile of Bills looks
of warm interest Shes embarrassed she turns away - then
scrambles to her feet as Margo approaches with Lloyd from the
direction of the pantry

Margos had too much to drink Her fake smile fades as Eve
gets up Shes unpleasant and depressed

MARGO
Dont get up And please stop
acting as if I were the queen
mother

EVE
(hurt)

Im sorry I didnt mean to-

BILL
(sharply)
Outside of a beehive Margo your
behavior would hardly be considered
either queenly or motherly

MARGO
Youre in a beehive pal didnt
you know Were all busy little
bees full of stings making honey
day and night-
(to Eve)
- arent we honey

KAREN
Margo really

MARGO

Please dont play governess Karen
I havent your unyielding good
taste I wish Id gone to Radcliffe
too but father wouldnt hear of it -
he needed help at the notions
counter

(to Addison)
Im being rude now arent I OR
should I say aint I

ADDISON
Youre maudlin and full of self
pity Youre magnificent

Max has come up with Miss Caswells drink

LLOYD
How about calling it a night

MARGO
And you pose as a playwright A
situation pregnant with
possibilities - and all you can
think of is everybody to go to
sleep

BILL
Its a good thought

MARGO
It wont play

KAREN
As a nonprofessional I think its
an excellent idea Undramatic but
practical

As she speaks she makes her way to Lloyds side

MARGO
Happy little housewife

BILL
Cut it out

MARGO
This is my house not a theater In
my house youre a guest not a
director-

KAREN
Then stop being a star - start
treating your guests as your
supporting cast

ADDISON
Hear hear

LLOYD
Now lets not get into a big hassle-

KAREN
Its about time we did Its about
time Margo realized that whats
attractive on stage need not
necessarily be attractive off

MARGO
(suddenly)
All right Im going to bed
(to Bill)
You be the host Its your party
Happy Birthday welcome home and
we-who-are-about-to-die-salute-you

She starts upstairs

BILL
Need any help

MARGO
(pauses smiles)
To put me to bed Take my clothes
off hold my head tuck me in turn
off the lights tiptoe out eve
would Wouldnt you Eve

EVE
If youd like

MARGO
I wouldnt like

She goes up exits out of sight A pause Miss Caswell
reaches up to take the drink out of Maxs hand

MAX
I forgot I had it

MISS CASWELL
I didnt

Bill gets up and goes after Margo

ADDISON
Too bad Well miss the third act
Theyre going to play it off stage

Eve turns away abruptly in sudden tears

LLOYD
Coming

KAREN
In a minute

She crosses to Eve puts an arm around her

KAREN
You mustnt mind Margo too much
even if I do

EVE
But there must be some reason
something Ive done without
knowing

KAREN
The reason is Margo and dont try
to figure it out Einstein

couldnt

EVE
If I thought Id offended her of
all people-

KAREN

Eve Im fond of Margo too But I
know Margo And every now and then
there is nothing I want to do so
much as to kick her right square in
the pants

EVE
(smiles)
Well - if shes got to pick on
someone Id just as soon it was
me

Karen smiles back She joins Lloyd and Max

LLOYD
Max is going to drop us
ADDISON
Ive often wondered Max why you
bother with a chauffeur and
limousine in New York City

MAX
In my case its necessary Too many
taxi drivers write plays

ADDISON
And too many of them are produced

MISS CASWELL
Lets go sit by the piano

ADDISON
You have me confused with Dan
Dailey You go sit by the piano
(to Eve)
And you come sit by me
(to the others)
Good night

They laugh say good night and start downstairs As Eve
crosses to Addison

EVE
Karen
(Karen pauses)
- you wont forget will you
What we talked about before

KAREN
(smiles)
No Eve I wont forget

She follows the men downstairs CLOSE UP of an old engraving
of Mrs Siddons as The Tragic Muse which hangs among other
theatrical mementos on the stair wall

INT DINING HALL - SARAH SIDDONS SOCIETY - NIGHT

The applause continues Margo sits back in her chair now
picking at a bit of fingernail polish

MARGOS VOICE
Bills welcoming-home-birthday
party a night to go down in
history Like the Chicago Fire - or
the Massacre of the Huguenots Even
before the party started I could
smell disaster in the air

INT MARGOS BEDROOM - NIGHT

The same night as the previous sequence but before the party
has started Margo is all dressed except for jewelry She
stands before her dressing table putting it
an enormous Martini

MARGOS VOICE
I knew it I sensed it even as I
finished dressing for that blasted
party

Birdie comes in

BIRDIE
You all put together

MARGO
My backs open
(Birdie goes to work on
it)
Did the extra help get here

BIRDIE
Theres some loose characters
dressed like maids and butlers
Whod you call - the William Morris
Agency

MARGO
Youre not being funny I could get
actors for less What about the
food

BIRDIE
The caterer had to back for hors
doeuvres-
(she zips Margo)
Voila

MARGO
(laughs)
That French ventriloquist taught
you a lot didnt he

BIRDIE

There was nothing he didnt know
(she starts tidying the
room)

Theres a message from the
bartender Does Miss Channing know
we ordered domestic gin by mistake

MARGO

The only thing I ordered by mistake
is the guests

(Birdie cackles)

Theyre domestic too and they
dont care what they drink as long
as it burns wheres Bill Hes
late

on She sips

at
BIRDIE
Late for what

MARGO
Dont be dense The party

BIRDIE
I aint dense And hes been here
twenty minutes

MARGO
Well I certainly think its odd he
hasnt even come up

Her glance meets Birdies She turns and strolls out
INT THIRD FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

Margo speeds up going down the stairs

INT SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

Margo shows up again deliberately as she reaches the landing
Sound of Bill and Eve laughing together from the living room
Margo strolls toward it casually

We see Eve seated looking up fascinated at Bill as he talks -
out of the laughter

BILL
Dont let it worry you said the
cameraman Even DeMille couldnt
see anything looking through the
wrong end-
(Eve chuckles)
So that was the first and last time-

Eve sees Margo approach She gets up Bill turns
INT MARGOS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
As Margo strolls up very off-hand

MARGO
Dont let me kill the point Or
isnt it a story for grownups

BILL
Youve heard it About when I
looked through the wrong end of a
camera finder

MARGO
(to Eve)
Remind me to tell you about when I
looked into the heart of an
artichoke

EVE
Id like to hear it

MARGO
Some snowy night in front of the
fire in the meantime while

were on the subject will you
check about the hors doeuvres The
caterer forgot them the varnish
wasnt dry or something

EVE
Of course

She leaves A short lull Margo looks into cigarette boxes
Bill eyes her curiosity crosses to the fire

BILL
Looks like Im going to have a very
fancy party

MARGO
I thought you were going to be late-

BILL
When Im guest of honor

MARGO
I had no idea you were even here

BILL
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs
she told me you were dressing

MARGO
That never stopped you before

BILL

Well we started talking she
wanted to know all about Hollywood
she seemed so interested

MARGO
Shes a girl of so many interests

BILL
Its a pretty rare quality these
days

MARGO
Shes a girl of so many rare
qualities

BILL

So she seems
MARGO

(the steel begins to

flash)
So youve pointed out so often So
many qualities so often Her
loyalty efficiency devotion
warmth affection - and so young
So young and so fair

Bill catches the drift Incredulously

BILL
I cant believe youre making this
up - it sounds like something out
of an old Clyde Fitch play

MARGO
Clyde Fitch thought you may not
think so was well before my time

BILL
(laughs)
Ive always denied the legend that
you were in Our American Cousin
the night Lincoln was shot

MARGO
I dont think thats funny

BILL
Of course its funny - this is all
too laughable to be anything else
You know what I think about this -
this age obsession of yours - and
now this ridiculous attempt to whip
yourself up into a jealous froth
because I spent ten minutes with a
stage-struck kid-

MARGO
Twenty minutes

BILL
Thirty minutes forty minutes What
of it

MARGO
Stage-struck kid shes a young

lady - of qualities And Ill have
you know Im fed up with both the
young lady and her qualities
Studying me as if - as if I were a
play or a set of blueprints How I
walk talk think eat sleep

BILL
Now how can you take offense at a
kid trying in every way to be as
much like her ideal as possible

MARGO
Stop calling her a kid It so
happens there are particular
aspects of my life to which I would
like to maintain sole and exclusive
rights and privileges

BILL
For instance what

MARGO
For instance - you

BILL
This is my cue to take you in my
arms and reassure you - but Im not
going to Im too mad-

MARGO
- guilty

BILL
Mad Darling there are certain
characteristics for which you are
famous - on stage and off I love
you for some of them - and in spite
of others I havent let those
become too important to me Theyre
part of your equipment for getting
along in what is laughably called
out environment - youve got to
keep your teeth sharp All right
But you will not sharpen them on me
- or on Eve

MARGO
What about her teeth What about
her fangs

BILL
She hasnt cut them yet and you
know it So when you start judging
an idealistic dreamy-eyed kid by
the barroom Benzedrine standards
of this megalomaniac society - I
wont have it Eve Harrington has
never by word look thought or
suggestion indicated anything to me
but her adoration for you and her
happiness at our being in love And
to intimate anything else doesnt
spell jealousy to me - it spells a
paranoic insecurity that you should
be ashamed of

MARGO
Cut Print it What happens in the
next reel Do I get dragged off
screaming to the snake pit

EVES VOICE
(quietly)
Miss Channing

Bill and Margo look off Eve is in the room They have no way
of knowing how long shes been there

EVE
The hors doeuvres are here Is
there anything else I can do

MARGO
Thank you Eve Id like a Martini -
very dry

BILL

Ill get it
(he crosses to Eve)
Whatll you have

Eve involuntarily looks to Margo

MARGO
A milkshake

Eve smiles turns to Bill

EVE
A Martini Very dry please

Bill smiles back and starts across the landing toward the
pantry As he crosses the stairs Karen Lloyd and Max come
up from the street level below General greetings Bill
continues up to pantry Eve and then Margo come up to add
their welcome

EVE
(to Karen)
May I have your coat

KAREN
Dont bother I can take it up
myself
EVE
Please
Karen yields with a thank you Eve- Eve goes up with the

coat Lloyd looks after her approvingly
LLOYD
I like that girl That quality of
quiet graciousness

MARGO
Among so many quiet qualities

They start for the living room

KAREN
Margo nothing youve ever done has
made me as happy as your taking Eve
in

MARGO
Im so happy youre happy

MAX
Look you havent been running a
settlement house exactly - the
kids earned her way You had a
pretty mixed-up inventory when she
took over - merchandise laying all
over the shop

LLOYD
Youve got Margo mixed up with a
five-and-ten-cent store

MARGO
Make it Bergdorf Goodman and now
everything is on its proper shelf
eh Max Done up in little ribbons
I could die right now and nobodyd
be confused How about you Max

MAX
How about me what

Theyve come to a halt near the fireplace

MARGO
Supposed you dropped dead What
about your inventory

MAX
I aint gonna die Not with a hit

KAREN
This is the most ghoulish
conversation

Bill brings two Martinis He hands one to Margo
MARGO

(it drips ice)
Thank you
BILL
Nothing really

MARGO

The kid - junior that is - will be
right down Unless youd like to
take her drink up to her

BILL

(smiles)
I can always get a fresh one Karen
- youre a Gibson girl

He hands Eves drink to Karen Max has wandered off Other
guests are arriving Margo gulps her drink hands Bill the

empty glass He puts it on a passing tray Margo takes a
fresh one at the same time

LLOYD
The general atmosphere is very
Macbethish What has or is about to
happen

MARGO
(to Bill)
What is he talking about

BILL
Macbeth

KAREN
(to Margo)
We know you weve seen you before
like this Is it over - or just
beginning

Margo surveys them all

MARGO
Fasten your seat belts Its going
to be a bumpy night

She downs the drink hands the empty glass to Bill and
leaves them She passes two women gabbing by the piano
they see her

WOMAN 1
Margo darling

WOMAN 2
Darling

MARGO
(passing)
Darlings

As
She arrives at the landing just as Addison comes up with Miss
Caswell Margo takes a drink from a passing tray

MARGO
(to Addison)
I distinctly remember striking your
name from the guest list What are
you doing here

ADDISON
Dear Margo You were an
unforgettable Peter Pan - you must
play it again soon You remember
Miss Caswell

MARGO
I do not How do you do

MISS CASWELL
We never met Thats why

ADDISON
Miss Caswell is an actress A
graduate of Copacabana School of
Dramatic Arts
(his glance is attracted
by Eve coming downstairs)
Ah Eve

EVE
(deferentially)
Good evening Mr deWitt

MARGO
I had no idea you knew each other

ADDISON
This must be at long last our
formal introduction Until now we
have met only in passing

MISS CASWELL
Thats how you met me In passing

MARGO

(smiles)
Eve this is an old friend of Mr
deWitts mother - Miss Caswell
Miss Harrington

(the two girls say hello)
Addison Ive been wanting you to
meet Eve for the longest time-

ADDISON
(murmurs)
It could only have been your
natural timidity that kept you from
mentioning it

MARGO
Youve heard of her great interest
in the Theater-

ADDISON
We have that in common

MARGO
Then you two must have a long talk-

EVE
Im afraid Mr deWitt would find me
boring before too long

MISS CASWELL
You wont bore him honey You
wont even get to talk

ADDISON
(icily)
Claudia dear come closer
(she does and he points)
This is Max Fabian He is a
producer Go do yourself some good

MISS CASWELL
(sighs)
Why do they always look like
unhappy rabbits

ADDISON
Because that is what they are Go
make him happy

Miss Caswell drapes her coat over the rail heads for Max
Addison puts Eves arm in his

ADDISON
(to Margo)
You mustnt worry about your little
charge She is in safe hands

MARGO
Amen

Eve smiles uncertainly at Margo as he leads her away Margo
looks after them She downs her drink

INT MARGOS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Its many Martinis later Most of the guests have gone The
party has reached that static state - everyones assumed more

or less permanent places

Birdie passes carrying a cup of coffee CAMERA FOLLOWS her
to the piano where Margo sits on the bench beside the
pianist He is just finishing Liebestraum and she stares
moodily into a Martini Birdie halts beside her with the
coffee Margo looks up Birdie holds out the coffee Margo
takes the onion out of the Martini drops it into the coffee
and waves Birdie away Birdie goes Liebestraum comes to an
end The pianist tries to ease into a more sophisticated
rhythm Margo stops him

MARGO
(quietly)
Liebestraum
PIANIST

I just played it

MARGO
Play it again

PIANIST
But that was the fourth straight
time

MARGO

Then this will be five I suppose
you think Im too drunk to count

PIANIST
No Youre just crazy about
Liebestraum
MARGO
Liebestraum
PIANIST
Look Miss Channing its kind of

depressing If you dont mind my
saying so everybodys kind of
dying on the vine

MARGO
My dear Horowitz In the first
place Im paying you union scale
Second its my piano Third if
everybody doesnt like kind of
dying on the vine they can get off
the vine and go home
Liebestraum

Unhappily he plays Liebestraum Margo sips her Martini
stares down into it again Bill tiptoes up

BILL
(whispers)
Many of your guests have been
wondering when they may be
permitted to view the body Where
has it been laid out

MARGO
(somberly)

It hasnt been laid out we havent
finished with the embalming As a
matter of fact youre looking at
it The remains of Margo Channing
Sitting up It is my last wish to
be buried sitting up

BILL
(trying to kid her out of
it)
Wouldnt you feel more natural
taking a bow

MARGO
You know nothing about feelings
natural or unnatural

BILL
Then without feeling your guests
were also wondering whether the
music couldnt be a shade more on
the - shall we say happier side

MARGO
If my guests do not like it here I
suggest they accompany you to the
nursery where Im sure you will all
feel more at home

Bill is about to get mad - when Max bustles up

MAX
Margo You by any chance got
bicarbonate of soda in the house

MARGO
(sympathetic)
Poor Max Heartburn
(Max nods)
Its that Miss Caswell I dont
know why she doesnt give Addison
heartburn

BILL
No heart to burn

MARGO
Everybody has a heart - except some
people
(she finishes her drink
stands up)
Of course Ive got bicarb Theres
a box in the pantry Well put your
name on it Max Fabian Itll say
there Always Just for you

MAX
(touched)
Let the rest of the world beat
their brains out for a buck Its
friends that count And I got
friends

MARGO
I love you Max I really mean it
I love you Come to the pantry

She takes off Max waits to set Bill straight

MAX
She loves me like a father Also
shes loaded

He starts off after Margo As the CAMERA PANS with Bill we
see Margo going into the pantry with Max following her Bill
joins Addison and Miss Caswell on the stairs

INT PANTRY - NIGHT

Its a good sized one In the bg the caterers are packing
dishes glassware etc Margo crosses to a cupboard She
finds the bicarb

MARGO
Here you are Maxie dear One good
burp and youll be rid of that Miss
Caswell

MAX
The situation Im in aint the kind
you can belch your way out I made
a promise

MARGO
Miss Caswell
(Max nods)
What
MAX

An audition for the part were
replacing Whats-her-name your
sister

He adds water to the bicarb

MARGO
Well if she can act she might not
be bad She looks like she might
burn down a plantation
MAX
(mixing)
I feel right now like theres one
burning in me

MARGO
Whens the audition

MAX
A couple of weeks

MARGO
I tell you what Why dont I read
with her

Would you

MARGO
Anything to help you out Max

MAX
This is real cooperation I
appreciate it

MARGO
Not at all And you could do me a
big favor if you would-

MAX
All you got to do is name it

MARGO
Give Eve Harrington job in you
office
Max burps
MARGO

You get quick action dont you

MAX
Margo I wouldnt think of taking
that girl away from you

MARGO
You said yourself my inventory was
in good shape - all of my
merchandise put away To keep her
here with nothing to do - Id be
standing in her way and you need
her Max

MAX
But what could she do

MARGO
Shed be a great help - read
scripts interview people you have
to see get rid of the ones you

dont have to youd be a man of
leisure-

MAX
Well

MARGO

Think of your health Max - more
time to relax out in the fresh air
at a race track

MAX
I dont know if this would be a
wise move

MARGO
Promise
MAX
I promise
MARGO
(happily)

Thats my Max

Lloyd enters looking for her

LLOYD

There you are both of you Max

Karen has decided its time to go

MARGO

Where is she

LLOYD
Up in the room

MAX
If youll excuse me-
(to Margo)

Ill tell Miss Caswell
He goes out A pause

MARGO
Whos left out there

LLOYD
Too many And youve got a new
guest A movie star from Hollywood

MARGO
Shucks And my autograph book is at
the cleaners
Another pause

MARGO
You disapprove of me when Im like
this dont you

LLOYD
Not exactly Sometimes though I
wish I understood you better

MARGO
When you do let me in on it

LLOYD
I will

Another pause

MARGO
Hows the new one coming

LLOYD
The play All right I guess

MARGO
Cora Shes - still a girl of
twenty

LLOYD

Twentyish It isnt important

MARGO
Dont you think its about time it
became important

LLOYD
How do you mean

MARGO
Dont be evasive

LLOYD
Margo you havent got any age

MARGO
Miss Channing is ageless Spoken
like a press agent

LLOYD
I know what Im talking about
after all theyre my plays

MARGO
Spoken like an author
(abruptly)
Lloyd Im not twentyish I am not
thirtyish Three months ago I was

forty years old Forty Four oh
(smiles)

That slipped out I hadnt quite

made up my mind to admit it Now I

feel as if Id suddenly taken all

my clothes off

LLOYD
Week after week to thousands of
people youre as young as you
want

MARGO
aS young as they want you
mean And Im not interested in
whether thousands of people think
Im six or six hundred-

LLOYD
Just one person Isnt that so
(Margo doesnt answer)

You know what this is all about
dont you It has very little to do
with whether you should play Cora
- it has everything to do with the
fact that youve had another fight
with Bill

A pause Margo closes the box of bicarb

MARGO

Bills thirty-two He looks thirty
two He looked it five years ago
hell look it twenty years from
now I hate men

(she puts the box down)
Dont worry Lloyd Ill play your
play Ill wear rompers and come in
rolling a hoop if you like lets
go say good night

They exit into the dining room As they open the swinging
door the CAMERA REMAINS in the doorway Margo and Lloyd walk
toward the stairs In the bg Eve is talking to the group
How much she says is dependent on how long it takes Margo and
Lloyd to reach her

EVE
(in the bg)

Imagine to know every night
that different hundreds of people
love you They smile their eyes
shine - youve pleased them they
want you you belong Anythings
worth that
Just as before she becomes aware of Margos approach with
Lloyd She scrambles to her feet

MARGO
Dont get up And please stop
acting as if I were the queen
mother

And as Margo speaks - or before - we
FADE OUT

FADE IN

EXT NY THEATER STREET - DAY

Margo gets out of a cab in front of the theater and goes in
Its Friday afternoon - no performance

MARGOS VOICE
What was it the wise man said -
This too will pass away Two
weeks later - the day of the
audition - all was well with Bill
and me the world and me-

INT LOBBY AND FOYER - CURRAN THEATER - DAY

Margo comes from the street through the lobby ( a few people
buying tickets) and into the deserted foyer She spots
Addison sprawled on one of the sofas

MARGO
Why so remote Addison I should
think youd be at the side of your
protegee lending her moral
support

ADDISON
Miss Caswell at the moment is
where I can lend no support - moral
or otherwise

MARGO
The ladies - shall we say -
lounge

ADDISON

Being violently ill to her tummy
MARGO

Its good luck before an audition

Shell be all right once it starts

She heads for the auditorium

ADDISON
A moment

Miss Caswell got lucky too late
The audition is over

MARGO
(stops)
Over It cant be Ive come to
read with her I promised Max

ADDISON
The audition was called for 230
It is now nearly four

MARGO

(lightly)
Is it really I must start wearing
a watch I never do you know
who read with Miss Caswell Bill

(he shakes his head)
Lloyd

(he shakes his head)
Well it couldnt have been Max
Who

ADDISON
Naturally enough your understudy

MARGO
I consider it highly unnatural to
allow a girl in an advanced state
of pregnancy-

ADDISON
I refer to your new and unpregnant
understudy Eve Harrington

MARGO
Eve My understudy

ADDISON
(keenly)
Didnt you know

MARGO
(quickly)
Of course I knew

ADDISON
It just slipped your mind

of silence

MARGO
How how was Miss Caswell

ADDISON
Frankly I dont remember
MARGO
Just slipped your mind

ADDISON
Completely Nor I am sure could
anyone else present tell you how
Miss Caswell read or whether Miss
Caswell read or rode a pogo stick

MARGO
Was she that bad

As Addison speaks he rises with excitement

ADDISON
Margo as you know i have lived in
the Theater as a Trappist monk
lives in his faith I have no other
world no other life - and once in
a great while I experience that
moment of Revelation for which all
true believers wait and pray You
were one Jeanne Eagels another
Paula Wessely Hayes - there are
others three or four Eve
Harrington will be among them

MARGO
(flatly)
I take it she read well

ADDISON
It wasnt reading it was a
performance Brilliant vivid
something made of music and fire

MARGO
How nice

ADDISON
In time shell be what you are

MARGO
A mass of music and fire Thats
me An old kazoo and some sparkles
Tell me - was Bill swept away too
or were you too full of Revelation
to notice

ADDISON
Bill didnt say - but Lloyd was
beside himself He listened to his
play as if someone else had written
it he said it sounded so fresh
so new so full of meaning

MARGO
How nice for Lloyd And how nice
for Eve How nice for everybody

Addison of course knows exactly what shes doing He senses
the approaching typhoon he whips it up

ADDISON
Eve was incredibly modest She
insisted that no credit was due
her that Lloyd felt as he did only
because she read lines exactly as
he had written them

MARGO
The implication being that I have
not been reading them as written

ADDISON
To the best of my recollection
neither your name nor your
performance entered the
conversation

Miss Caswell appears uncertain in the bg

ADDISON
Feeling better my dear

MISS CASWELL
Like I just swam the English
Channel Now what

ADDISON
You next move it seems to me
should be toward television

Margo abruptly starts for the auditorium Addison smiles
He takes Miss Caswells arm

MISS CASWELL
Tell me this Do they have
auditions for television

ADDISON
Thats all television is my dear
Nothing but auditions
He takes her toward the street

INT THEATER - CURRAN THEATER - DAY

The curtain is up the set covered is a bedroom in a
deteriorating Southern mansion

There is no one in the theater but Max seated on the aisle
about two-thirds down and Eve with Lloyd and Bill on the
stage She is seated they stand between her and auditorium
There is some ad lib talk among the three which we cannot
make out Margo marches down the aisle with a steady pace

She passes Max smiles a sickly hopeful smile She ignores
him as if he were a used paper cup She disappears through
the door which leads backstage

Max whistles Lloyd turns Max indicated the door and puts
his hands to his head in despair

Margo walks out of the wings on stage Bill and Lloyd turn to
her Eve rises

MARGO
(cheerily)
Terribly sorry Im late lunch was
long and I couldnt find a cab -
wheres Miss Caswell shall we
start Oh hello Eve

EVE
Hello Miss Channing

MARGO

How are you making out in Mr
Fabians office

(over the footlights to

Max)
I dont want you working the child
too hard Max - just because you
promised As you see I kept my
promise too

Max slumps in his seat By the time Margo turns back to them
the others have exchanged swift looks

BILL
Its all over

MARGO
Whats all over

BILL
The audition

MARGO

(pleased astonishment)
Eve

(she turns to her)
How enchanting

(to Lloyd and Bill)
Wherever did you get the idea of
having Eve read with Miss Caswell

LLOYD
Shes your understudy
MARGO
Eve Eve my understudy But I had
no idea

LLOYD
I thought you knew She was put
on over a week ago-

MARGO
It seems almost inconceivable that
I havent seen her backstage but
with so many people loitering
around well well So Eve is not
working for Max after all-

(out to Max again)

- Max you sly puss

Max submerges further in his seat

EVE
Miss Channing I cant tell you how
glad I am that you arrived so late

MARGO
Really Eve Why

EVE
Well if youd been here to begin
with I wouldnt have dared to read
at all

MARGO
Why not

EVE
and if youd come in the
middle Id have stopped I
couldnt have gone on-

MARGO
(murmurs)
What a pity all that fire and
music being turned off

BILL
What fire and music

MARGO
You wouldnt understand
(to Lloyd)
How was Miss Caswell

LLOYD
Back to Copacabana But Eve Margo
let me tell you about Eve-

EVE
(breaking in)
I was dreadful Miss Channing
believe me - I have no right to be
anyones understudy much less
yours

MARGO
Im sure you underestimate
yourself Eve You always do
(to Lloyd)
You were about to tell me about
Eve

LLOYD
Youd have been proud of her

MARGO
Im sure

LLOYD
She was a revelation

MARGO
To you too

LLOYD
What do you mean

MARGO
(the ice begins to form)
I mean among other things that it
must have been a revelation to have
your twenty-four-year-old character
played by twenty-four-year-old
actress

LLOYD
Thats beside the point

MARGO
Its right to the point Also that
it must have sounded so new and
fresh to you - so exciting to have
the lines read as you wrote them

BILL
Addison-

MARGO
So full of meaning fire and music

LLOYD
Youve been talking to that
venomous fishwife Addison deWitt-

MARGO
- in this case apparently as
trustworthy as the World Almanac

LLOYD
You knew when you came in that the
audition was over that Eve was
your understudy Playing that
childish game of cat and mouse

MARGO
Not mouse never mouse If anything
- rat

LLOYD

You have a genius for making
barroom brawl out of a perfectly
innocent misunderstanding at most

MARGO
Perfectly innocent Man have been
hanged for less Im lied to
attacked behind my back accused of
reading your silly dialogue
inaccurately - as if it were Holy
Gospel

LLOYD
I never said it was

MARGO
Then you listened as if someone
else had written you play - whom
did you have in mind Sherwood
Arthur Miller Beaumont and
Fletcher

Max has edged his way to the stage

MAX
(from below)
May I say a word

LLOYD

No
(to Margo)

What makes you think that either
Miller or Sherwood would stand for
the nonsense I take from you -
youd better stick to Beaumont and
Fletcher Theyve been dead for
three hundred years

He stalks into the wings Bills reaction to the fight is
typical He lights a cigarette stretches out on the covered
bed Eve stands frozen with fear Margo yells after Lloyd
into the wings

MARGO
And theyre getting better

performances today than

they ever

got All playwrights should be dead

for three hundred years

Lloyd comes out of the door leading to the auditorium The

battle goes on without a pause
to Max at row A center

As he yells back he crosses

LLOYD
That would solve none of their
problems - because actresses never
die The stars never die and never
change

He starts up the aisle with Max

Now its

MARGO
You can change this star any time
you want For a new fresh
exciting one fully equipped with

fire and music Any time you want -

starting with tonights
performance

Max who stops and shouts back at her

MAX
This is for lawyers to talk about
this concerns a run-of-the-play
contract and this you cant
rewrite or ad lib

MARGO
(from the stage)
Are you threatening me with legal
action Mr Fabian

MAX
Are you breaking the contract

MARGO
Answer my question

MAX
Who am I to threaten Im a dying
man

MARGO
I didnt hear you

MAX
(yelling)
I said Im a dying man

MARGO
Not until the last drugstore has
sold its last pill

LLOYD

(from the top of the

aisle)
I shall never understand the weird
process by which a body with a
voice suddenly fancies itself a
mind Just when exactly does an
actress decide theyre her words
shes saying and her thoughts shes
expressing

MARGO
Usually at the point when shes got
to rewrite and rethink them to keep
the audience from leaving the
theater

LLOYD
Its about time the piano realized
it has not written the concerto

Max has already walked out unhappily Lloyd now slams out
Margo glares after him then turns to Bill who smokes his
cigarette peacefully on the bed

MARGO

(quiet menace)
And you I take it are the
Paderewski who plays his concerto
on me the piano

(Bill waves his cigarette

hes noncommittal)
Where is Princess Fire-and-Music

BILL
Who

MARGO
The kid Junior

BILL
(looks lazily)
Gone

MARGO
I must have frightened her away

BILL
I wouldnt be surprised Sometimes
you frighten me

MARGO
(paces up and down)
Poor little flower Just dropped
her petals and folded her tent
BILL
Dont mix your metaphors

MARGO
I mix what I like

BILL
Okay Mix

MARGO
Im nothing but a body with a
voice No mind

BILL
What a body what a voice

MARGO
The ex-ship news reporter No
body no voice all mind

BILL
The gong rang The fights over
Calm down

MARGO
I will not calm down

BILL
Dont calm down

MARGO
Youre being terribly tolerant
arent you

BILL
Im trying terribly hard

MARGO
Well you neednt I will not be
tolerated And I will not be
plotted against

BILL
Here we go

MARGO
Such nonsense what do you all take
me for - little Nell from the
country Been my understudy for
over a week without my knowing
carefully hidden no doubt-

BILL
(sits up)
Now dont get carried away-
MARGO
(going right on)
- shows up for an audition when
everyone knew Id be here and
gives a performance Out of nowhere
- gives a performance

BILL
Youve been all through that with
Lloyd-

MARGO

The playwright doesnt make the
performance - and it doesnt just
happen And this one didnt - full
of fire and music and whatnot it
was carefully rehearsed I have no
doubt over and over full of those
Bill Sampson touches

BILL
I am sick and tired of these
paranoiac outbursts

MARGO
Paranoiac

BILL
I didnt know Eve Harrington was
your understudy until half past two
this afternoon

MARGO
Tell that to Dr Freud Along with
the rest of it

She turns away Bill grabs her pulls her down on the bed
holds her down

BILL
No Ill tell it to you For the
last time Ill tell it to you
Because youve got to stop hurting
yourself and me and the two of us
by these paranoiac tantrums

MARGO
(struggling)
That word again I dont even know
what it means

BILL
(firmly)
Its time you found out I love
you
(Margo says Ha)
I love you Youre a beautiful and
intelligent woman-
(Margo says A body with a
voice)
- a beautiful and intelligent woman
and a great actress-
(he waits Margo says
nothing)

- at the peak of her career You
have every reason for happiness-
(Margo says Except

happiness)
- every reason but due to some
strange uncontrollable
unconscious drive you permit the
slightest action of a kid-

(Margo sneers Kid)
- kid like Eve to turn you into a
hysterical screaming harpy Now
once and for all stop it

Margo seems quiet He gets up She sits up

MARGO
Its obvious youre not a woman

BILL
Ive been aware of that for some
time
MARGO
Well I am
BILL
Ill say
MARGO

Dont be condescending

BILL
Come on get up Ill buy youa
drink

MARGO

(with dignity)
I admit I may have seen better
days but I am still not to be had
for the price of a cocktail - like
a salted peanut

BILL
(laughs)
Margo lets make peace

MARGO
The terms are too high
Unconditional surrender
BILL
Just being happy Just stopping all
this nonsense about Eve - and Eve
and me

MARGO
Its not nonsense

BILL
But if I tell you it is - as I just
did Were you listening to me
(Margo nods)
Isnt that enough

MARGO
I wish it were

BILL
Then what would be enough
(Margo doesnt answer)
If we were married

MARGO
I wouldnt want you to marry me
just to prove something

BILL
Youve had so many reasons for not
wanting to marry me Margo tell

me whats behind all this

MARGO
I - I dont know Bill Just a
feeling I dont know

BILL

I think you do know but you wont
or cant tell me

(Margo doesnt say)
I said before it was going to be my
last try and I meant it I cant
think of anything else to do I
wish I could

(a pause)
We usually wind up screaming and
throwing things as the curtain
comes down Then it comes up again
and everythings fine But not this
time

(he takes a breath)
You know there isnt a playwright
in the world who could make me
believe this would happen between
two adult people Goodbye Margo

No word from her He starts away
MARGO

Bill
(he stops)
where are you going To find
Eve
BILL

(smiles grimly)

That suddenly makes the whole thing

believable

He goes out Margo alone sit for a moment sadly Then she

begins to cry

INT RICHARDS STUDIO APARTMENT - DAY

One large room a small foyer with a door to the corridor

A

stair up one wall to a narrow balcony from which a couple of

bedroom open

Karen is painting Earnestly but badly A still life of an

orange an avocado an eggplant and three bananas

KARENS VOICE
On the day of the audition my

biggest worry was to keep a banana

looking part of an eggplant then

Lloyd came home
(in the bg Lloyd lets
himself in)
It was right after his brawl with
Margo

Lloyd slams the door flings his hat away
peeling off muffler and overcoat

KAREN
Lloyd what happened

LLOYD
Up to here Thats where Ive got
it - up to here Of all the star
ridden presumptuous hysterical-

KAREN
Margo again

LLOYD

strides

And again and again Two hours late

for the audition to begin with-

KAREN
Thats on time for Margo

LLOYD
Then a childish heavy-handed
routine about not knowing Eve was

in
her understudy-

KAREN
Its just possible she didnt

LLOYD
Of course she knew For one thing
Addison told her how superbly Eve
had read the part-

(suddenly softening)

Karen let me tell you about Eve
Shes got everything - a born
actress Sensitive understanding
young exciting vibrant-

KAREN
- dont run out of adjectives
dear

LLOYD

- everything a playwright first
thinks of wanting to write about
until his play becomes a vehicle
for Miss Channing

KAREN
Margo hasnt done badly by it

LLOYD
Margo Margos great She knows it
Thats the trouble
She can play Pecks Bad Boy all she
wants and whos to stop her Whos
to give her that boot in the rear
she needs and deserves

He starts up the stairs to the bedroom

KAREN
(murmurs)
Its going to be a cozy weekend

LLOYD
(pauses)
What is

KAREN
Were driving out to the country
tomorrow night Just the four of
us Bill Margo you andl

LLOYD
Well Weve spent weekends before
with nobody talking
(continues up stairs)
- just be sure to lock up all
blunt instruments and throwable
objects

As he goes into one of the bedrooms Karen sits thoughtfully
on a couch She muses

KARENS VOICE
Newton - they say thought of
gravity by getting hit on the head
by an apple And the man who
invented the steam engine he was
watching a tea-kettle but not
me My Big Idea came to me just
sitting on a couch

She lies down folds her hands behind her head

KARENS VOICE
That boot in the rear to Margo
Heaven knows she had one coming
From me from Lloyd from Eve
Bill Max and so on - wed all
felt those size fives of hers often
enough but how The answer was
buzzing around me like a fly

She sits up She smiles The smile fades

KARENS VOICE
I had it But I let it go
Screaming and calling names is one
thing - but this could mean

She shakes her head crosses to her easel resumes work on
the bananas She slows down then stops

KARENS VOICE
Why not Why I said to myself
not It would all seem perfectly
legitimate And there were only two
people in the world who would know
Also the boot would land where it
would do the most good for all
concerned-

She puts the brush away and crosses to the phone which is by
Lloyds work chair As she crosses

KARENS VOICE
And after all it was not more than
a perfectly harmless joke which
Margo herself would be the first
to enjoy

She looks in a leather phone book pick up the phone and
dials

KARENS VOICE
- and no reason why she shouldnt
be told about it - in time

Theres an answer at the other end

KAREN
(into phone)
Hello will you call Miss Eve
Harrington to the phone please
Not at all thank you

And as she waits we
DISSOLVE TO
EXT COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT

Open country Preferably no houses in sight Plenty of snow
Lloyds car drives along

KARENS VOICE
It was a cold weekend - outside and
in Bill didnt come at all
Margo didnt know where he was and
didnt care - she kept saying
Somehow we staggered through Sunday
- and by the time we drive Margo to
the station late Monday afternoon
she and Lloyd had thawed out to the
extent of being civil to each
other

INT COUPE - NIGHT
Lloyd driving All three in the front seat

KAREN
What time is it

LLOYD
When you asked a minute ago it was
five-forty-two It is now five
forty-three When you ask a minute
from no it will be-

KAREN
I just dont want Margo to miss her
train As it is shell barely make
the theater

LLOYD
Five-fifty-five Well be at the
station in plenty of time

MARGO
That little place just two hours
form New York Its on my list of
things-Ill-never-understand Like
collecting shrunken Indian heads

KAREN
Of all people you should know what
it means to want some peace and
quiet-

MARGO
Peace and quit is for libraries

The car swerves - suddenly and slightly

KAREN
Lloyd be careful

LLOYD
Just a little skid thats all
This roads like glass

MARGO
Karen and I just dont want an
accident-

LLOYD
I have no intention of having an
accident

MARGO

Its not important whether you do
We are wearing long underwear

They all laugh Suddenly the car slows and stops - with that
hissing sound that can mean only one thing - no gas

LLOYD
Now whats this

He tries to start it again No luck He turns on the
dashboard lights The gas gauge reads empty

LLOYD
But it cant be We cant be out of
gas I filled it myself yesterday
(to Karen)
Wasnt it full when you drove to
Brewster this morning

KAREN
(very low)
I guess I didnt look You know I
dont pay attention to those
things

LLOYD
Incredible
Futilely

A moment

he runs the started again

MARGO
(crisply)
How much time have we

KAREN
Roughly ten minutes

MARGO
How far to the station

KAREN
Three or four miles

MARGO
Any houses or farms around where we
can borrow gas

KAREN
(looking)
None in sight there arent many
along this back road

MARGO
Not many car either not much
chance of a lift

of silence

LLOYD
Well No sense my just sitting
here Im going to walk up about
half a mile just in case

He starts out of the car The cold comes in like a knife
women react

KAREN
Youll break your neck on that ice

LLOYD
(grins)
What a way to die - trying to get
an actress to the theater in time
Tell Max I want to be buried with
royalties

KAREN
Dont joke about such things

MARGO
(quietly)
How fortunate that I have an
understudy so ready so willing and
so able to go on

the
LLOYD
The audience will want its money
refunded believe me

MARGO
Thank you Lloyd Godspeed

Lloyd starts down the road He slips once recovers waves
and keeps going

KAREN
He always looks so pathetic
whenever he does anything physical-

MARGO
It seems to me that walking for
most people is not very dangerous

KAREN
(smiles)
I just never think of Lloyd as
anywhere but indoors and anything
but sitting down

MARGO
Be brave Hell come back - with or
without gas

They tuck the fur car robe around them A pause Margo turns
on the radio its Liebestraum

MARGO
Do you want it on

KAREN
It doesnt matter

MARGO
I detest cheap sentiment

She turns it off Another pause

MARGO
Karen
(Karen says hm)
I havent been pleasant this

weekend

KAREN
Weve all seemed a little tense
lately

MARGO

Come to think of it I havent been
very pleasant for weeks For that
Im truly sorry More than any two
people I know I dont want you and
Lloyd to be angry with me

KAREN
Were never deeply angry we just
get sore The way you do We know
you too well

MARGO
So many people - know me I wish I
did I wish someone would tell be
about me

KAREN
Youre Margo Just - Margo

MARGO
And what is that Besides something
spelled out in light bulbs I mean
Besides something called
temperament which consists mostly
of swooping about on a broomstick
creaming at the top of my voice
infants behave the way I do you
know They carry on and misbehave -
theyd get drunk if they knew how -
when they cant have what they
want When they feel unwanted and
insecure - or unloved

Theres a pause

KAREN
What about Bill

MARGO
What about Bill

KAREN
Hes in love with you

MARGO
More than anything in this world I
love Bill And I want Bill I want
him to want me But me Not Margo
Channing And if I cant tell they
apart - how can he

KAREN
Why should he - and why should you

MARGO
Bills in love with Margo Channing
Hes fought with her worked with
her loved her but ten years
from now - Margo Channing will have
ceased to exist And whats left
will be what
KAREN
Margo Bill is all of eight years
younger than you

MARGO
Those years stretch as the years go
on Ive seen it happen too often

KAREN
Not to you Not to Bill

MARGO
Isnt that what they always say

She turns the radio on again A piano nocturne

MARGO
I dont suppose the heater runs
when the motor doesnt

KAREN
Silly isnt it Youd think theyd
fix it so people could just sit in
a car and keep warm

Margo nods get some cigarettes out of her bag She offers
one to Karen They light up

MARGO
About Eve Ive acted pretty
disgracefully toward her too

KAREN
Well

MARGO
Lets not fumble for excuses not
here and now with my hair down At
best lets say Ive been
oversensitive to well to the
fact that shes so young - so
feminine and helpless To so many
things I want to be for Bill
funny business a womans career
The things you drop on your way up
the ladder so you can move faster
You forget youll need them again
when you go back to being a woman
Thats one career all females have
in common - whether we like it or
not - being a woman
Sooner or later weve all got to
work at it no matter what other
careers weve had or wanted and
in the last analysis nothing is
any good unless you can look up
just before dinner or turns around
in bed - and there he is Without
that youre not woman Youre
something with a French provincial
office or a book full of clippings -
but youre not a woman
(she smiles at Karen)
Slow curtain The end

A pause There are tears in Karens eyes

KAREN
Margo
(she hesitates)
Margo I want you to know how sorry
I am about this

MARGO
About what
KAREN
(indicating their
predicament)
This I cant tell you how sorry I
am
MARGO

Dont give it another thought one
of destinys many pranks After
all you didnt personally drain
the gasoline out of the tank

She snuggles down into her furs Karen flashes an unhappy
look at her She too snuggles down

EXT THEATER ALLEY - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT

The snow has been shoveled to either side of the alley
making a lane The performance is just over

Addison his back to us stands looking toward the stage
door A few actors on their way out

ADDISONS VOICE
Eve of course was superb Many of
the audience understandably
preferred to return another time to
see Margo
But those who remained cheered
loudly lustily and long for Eve
how thoughtful of her to call and
invite me - that afternoon

He starts to walk toward the stage door

ADDISONS VOICE
and what a happy coincidence
that several representatives of
other newspapers happened to be
present All of us - invited that
afternoon to attend an understudys
performance

He goes in the stage door
INT BACKSTAGE - CURRAN THEATER - NIGHT

More activity than last time the performance being just
over Addison comes through the door picks his way toward
Margos dressing room

ADDISONS VOICE
about which the management knew
nothing until they were forced to
ring up the curtain at nine
oclock Coincidence Also every
indication of intrigue skulduggery
and fraud

The door tot he dressing room is open just a bit Addison
pauses beside the door to listen

BILL
(from within)
you were better than all right
kid you gave a performance you
rang a bell-

Addison uses his cane to swing the door open farther so that
both he and WE can see as well as hear

INT MARGOS DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Bill faces Eve who wears Margos costume She is a ravishing
sight Her eyes shine up to his radiantly

BILL

(continuing)
- little things here and there it
doesnt matter You can be proud of
yourself youve got a right to be

EVE
(quietly)
Are you proud of me Bill

BILL
Ill admit I was worried when Max
called I had my doubts

EVE
You shouldnt have had any doubts

BILL
- after all the other day was one
scene the woods are full of one
scene sensations But you did it
With work and patience youll be a
fine actress If thats what you
want to be

EVE
Is that what you want me to be

BILL
Im talking about you And what you
want

EVE
So am I

BILL

What have I got to do with it

EVE
Everything
BILL
(lightly)

The names Ive been called But
never Svengali

(he pats her shoulder)
Good luck

He starts out Addison ducks

EVE
Dont run away Bill

BILL
(stops)
From what would I be running

EVE
Youre always after truth - on the
stage What about off

BILL
(curiously)

Im for it
EVE

Then face it I have Since that
first night - here - in the
dressing room

BILL
(smiles)
When I told you what every young
actress should know
Tears come to Eves eyes

EVE
When you told me that whatever I
became it would be because of you-

BILL
Your make-ups a little heavy

EVE
- and for you

BILL
(slowly)
Youre quite a girl

EVE
You think

BILL
Im in love with Margo Hadnt you
heard

EVE
You hear all kinds of things

BILL
Im only human rumors to the
contrary And Im as curious as the
next man

EVE
Find out
BILL
(deliberately)

Only thing what I go after I want
to go after I dont want it to
come after me

BILL
Dont cry Just score it as an
incomplete forward pass

She turns away slowly

He walks out Addison ducks to avoid being seen Eve glares

after Bill
dressing table

Swiftly

she snatches them up and in a sharp

tears the wig from her head throws it on the
Her glance is caught by a pair of scissors

vicious gesture

she slashes the wig Addison knocks politely at the door Eve

turns

ADDISON
May I come in

EVE
Certainly Mr deWitt
ADDISON
(entering)
I expected to find this little room
overcrowded with a theater full of
people at your feet

EVE
I consider myself lucky they didnt
throw things

She starts creaming her face removing make-up

ADDISON
Of course your performance was no
surprise to me After the other day
I regarded it as no more than - a
promised fulfilled

EVE
Youre more than kind But its
still Miss Channings performance
Im just a carbon copy you read
when you cant find the original

ADDISON
Youre more than modest

EVE
Its not modesty I just dont try
to kid myself

ADDISON
A revolutionary approach to the
Theater However if I may a
suggestion

EVE
Please do

ADDISON
I think the time has come for you
to shed some of your humility It
is just as false not to blow your
horn at all as it is to blow it too
loudly

EVE
I dont think Ive done anything to
sound off about

ADDISON
We all come into this world with
our little egos equipped with
individual horns If we dont blow
them - who will

EVE
Even so One isolated pretty good
performance by an understudy Itll
be forgotten tomorrow

ADDISON
It neednt be

EVE
Even if I wanted to - as you say -
be less humble blow my own horn
how would I do it Im less than
nobody

ADDISON
I am somebody

Eve rises She eyes him steadily

She goes

Eve does

EVE
You certainly are

into the bathroom

ADDISON
Leave the door open a bit so we
can talk

so

ADDISON
After you change if youre not
busy elsewhere we can have supper

EVE
(from the bathroom)
Id love to Or should I pretend
Im busy

ADDISON
(smiling)
Lets have a minimum of pretending
Ill want to do a column about you-

EVE
Im not enough for a paragraph

ADDISON

- perhaps more than one Theres so
much I want to know Ive heard
your story in bits and pieces
your home in Wisconsin your tragic
marriage your financial attachment
to Margo - it started in San
Francisco didnt it

(no answer Addison

smiles)
I say - your idolatry of Margo
started in San Francisco didnt
it

EVE
Thats right

ADDISON
San Francisco An oasis of
civilization in the California
desert Tell me do you share my
high opinion of San Francisco

EVE
Yes I do

ADDISON
And that memorable night when Margo
first dazzled you from the stage -
which theater was it in San
Francisco Was it - the Shubert

EVE
(a slight pause)
Yes The Shubert

ADDISON
(grins happily)
A fine old theater the Shubert
Full of tradition untouched by the

earthquake - so sorry - fire by
the way what was your husbands
name

EVE
Eddie

ADDISON

Eddie what
Eve sticks her head and naked shoulder around the door

EVE
Im about to go into the shower I
wont be able to hear you

ADDISON
I can wait Where would you like to
go Well make this a special
night

EVE
(trustingly)
You take charge

ADDISON
I believe I will
She closes the door He leans back lights a cigarette
EXT 52ND STREET - NEW YORK - NIGHT

A cab drives up to 21

KARENS VOICE
Some of the morning papers carried
a little squib about Eves
performance Not much but full
praise
I couldnt imagine how they found
out about it - but Lloyd said Maxs
publicity man probably sent out the
story

Karen gets out of the cab pays and goes in

KARENS VOICE
- at any rate I feel terribly
guilty and ashamed of myself - and
wanted nothing so much as to forget
the whole thing Margo and I were
having lunch at 21 - just like
girlfriends - with hats on

INT LOBBY - 21 - DAY
Karen consults her watch and the doorman as she enters

KAREN
Has Miss Channing come in

DOORMAN
Not yet Mrs Richards

Karen sees Eve who waits as Addison hands his hat coat
cane to an attendant She smiles crosses to her

KAREN
Eve Ive heard the most wonderful
things about your performance-

EVE
Mostly relief that I managed to
stagger through it at all

ADDISON
She was magnificent

KAREN
(pleased)
Then youve heard too

ADDISON
I was there An eyewitness

and
KAREN

(staggered)
You were there At the play - last
night
ADDISON
(smiles)

A happy coincidence

EVE
(quickly)
Were having lunch with a movie
talent scout

KAREN
They certainly dont waste much
time

EVE

Nothing definite yet - its just to
have lunch

ADDISON
Theyll be wasting this much of
their time at any rate Eve has no
intention of going to Hollywood

He turns to Karen changing the subject

ADDISON
From the smartness of your dress I
take it your luncheon companion is
a lady

KAREN
(smiles)
Margo

ADDISON
Margo Lunching in public

KAREN
Its new Margo But shes just as
late as the old one

ADDISON
She may be later than you think

As he speaks he crosses to pick up an evening paper
it as he comes back

ADDISON
(handing it to her)
Why not read my column to pass the
time The minutes will fly like
hours
(he takes Eves arm)

opens
and now we must join our
sunburned eager beaver

He goes up the stairs with Eve Karen glances after them
curiously then at the column

It is headed Things I Promised Not To Tell by Addison
deWitt He expression becomes increasingly horrified She
drops the paper and rushes out

INT MARGOS LIVING ROOM - DAY

Addisons column quivers in Margos hand as she strides about
reading it Karen sits miserably

MARGO

(declaiming)
my hat which has lo these
many seasons become more firmly
rooted about my ears is lifted to
Miss Harrington I am once more
available for dancing in the
streets and shouting from the
housetops I thought that one
went out with Woollcott

(she skips part of the

column)
Down here here listen to this-
Miss Harrington had much to
tell - and these columns shall
report her faithfully - about the
lamentable practice in our Theater
of permitting shall we say -
mature - actresses to continue
playing roles requiring a youth and
vigor of which they retain but a
dim memory-

KAREN
I just cant believe it

MARGO
It get better - About the
understandable reluctance on the
part of our entrenched First Ladies
of the Stage to encourage shall we
say - younger - actresses about
Miss Harringtons own long and
unsupported struggle for

opportunity-

KAREN
I cant believe Eve said those
things

Margo crumples the paper as if it were Eves neck

MARGO
(pacing)
In this rat race everybodys
guilty till theyre proved
innocent One of the differences
between the Theater and
civilization

(she hurls the paper away)

what gets me is how all of

those papers in town happened to
catch that particular performance

KAREN
(weakly)
Lloyd says its a publicity
release

MARGO
The little witch must have had
Indians runners out snatching
critics out of bars steam rooms
and museums or wherever they hole
up well she wont get away with
it Nor will Addison deWitt and his
poison pen If Equity or my lawyer
cant or wont do anything about
it I will personally stuff that
pathetic little lost lamb down Mr
deWitts ugly throat

She pauses in midair to look at Bill He has come up the
stairs tow at a time stands at the landing

BILL
(quietly)
I came as soon as I read that piece
of filth I ran all the way

Margo suddenly starts to cry She turns from him Bill takes
her in his arms He holds her

BILL
Bills here baby Everythings all
right now

Margo says nothing just hides in his embrace He soothes
her pets her he looks over at Karen

KAREN
I guess at this point Im what the
French call de trop

BILL
(smiles)
Maybe just a little around the
edges

Karen smiles back waves and goes out
INT RICHARDS APARTMENT - DAY

Karens having some lunch Lloyd still in his robe sits
opposite her having some coffee and a cigarette A copy of
the interview before him

LLOYD
(is saying)
- its Addison from start to
finish it drips with his brand of
venom taking advantage of a kid
like that twisting her words
making her say what he wanted her

to say-
KAREN
Whered you get all that
information
LLOYD
(put out his cigarette)
Eve
KAREN
Eve
LLOYD

Shes been to see me as a matter
of fact she left just before you
came in - you just missed her

KAREN
That was a pity

LLOYD
(gets up)
She wanted to explain about her
interview wanted to apologize to
someone - and didnt dare face
Margo

KAREN
I wonder why

Lloyd wanders about - he seems to be searching for words for
a position to maintain

LLOYD
She started to tell me all about it
- and she couldnt finish she
cried so

Hes over by a window his back to her Karen eyes him
curiously waiting for the payoff

LLOYD
A pause

(finally)
You know Ive been going over our
financial condition - if youll
pardon the expression

KAREN
Thats quite a change of subject

LLOYD
(walks again)
What with taxes coming up - and
since Im a playwright and not an
oil well operator - well Ive been
thinking

KAREN
Im trying hard to follow you

LLOYD
If - instead of waiting until next
season to do ‘Footsteps on the
Ceiling which is in pretty good
shape - and if Margo can be talked
into going on tour with Aged in
Wood - we could put Footsteps
into production right away

KAREN
Im beginning to catch up

LLOYD
If we could cast it properly that
is

KAREN
(carefully)
Maybe get some younger actress for
the part Someone whod look the
part as well as play it

LLOYD
(smiles)
Youve got to admit it would be a
novelty

KAREN
Now youre quoting Addison Or Eve

LLOYD
Eve did mention the play you know
But just in passing - shes never
ask to play a part like Cora
shed never have the nerve

KAREN
Eve would ask Abbott to give her
Costello

LLOYD
No I got the idea myself - while
she was talking to me

KAREN
With gestures of course

LLOYD
(wistfully)
For once to write something and
have it realized completely For
once not to compromise-

Now Karen explodes She rises

KAREN
Lloyd Richards you are not to
consider giving that contemptible
little worm the part of Cora

LLOYD
Now just a minute-

KAREN
Margo Channing has not been exactly
a compromise all these years half
the playwrights in the world would
give their shirts for that
particular compromise

LLOYD
(angry)
Now just a minute

KAREN
It strikes me that Eves disloyalty
and ingratitude must be contagious

Lloyds full of anger and guilt He snaps back

LLOYD
All this fuss and hysteria because
an impulsive kid got carried away
by excitement and the conniving of
a professional manure slinger named
deWitt She apologized didnt she

KAREN
On her knees I have no doubt Very
touching very Academy-of-Dramatic
Arts

LLOYD
That bitter cynicism of yours is
something youve acquired since you
left Radcliffe

KAREN
The cynicism you refer to I
acquired the day I discovered I was
different from little boys

The phone has been ringing Lloyd snarls into it

LLOYD
Hello
(he quiets down)

hi Margo no not at all
Karen and I were just chatting
hmm why - why yes Im sure we
can and Im sure wed love to
right 1145ish See you then

He hangs up He smiles - suddenly theres peace

LLOYD
Margo - and Bill - want us to meet
them at the Cub Room tonight after
theater For a bottle of wine

KAREN
(smiles)
Margo in the Cub Room I couldnt
be more surprised if shed said
Grants Tomb

LLOYD
Im glad Bills back

KAREN
Theyd die without each other

A pause

LLOYD
Darling I didnt promise Eve
anything Just said I thought shed
be fine for the part but there
were some practical difficulties

KAREN
Such as

LLOYD
(grins)
You - for one I told her you were
set on Margo playing the part - and
I certainly wouldnt make a change
without your approval

Karen smiles happily
KAREN
Thats fine Fine and dandy Id
enjoy nothing more Just refer all
of Miss Harringtons future
requests to me

INT CUB ROOM - STORK CLUB - NIGHT

Margo Karen Bill and Lloyd are ensconced happily at a table
in the rear of the room A bottle of fine wine is being
poured Their mood is equally bubbly

BILL
The so-called art of acting is not
one for which I have a particularly
high regard

MARGO
Hear hear

BILL
But you may quote me as follows
Quote Tonight Miss Margo Channing
gave a performance in your
cockamamie play the like of which
I have never seen before and expect
rarely to see again Unquote

MARGO
He does not exaggerate I was good

BILL
You were great

As they look at each other they reflect the understanding
that has hit them both at last

LLOYD
Its been quite a night I
understand that your understudy -
Miss Harrington - has given her

notice
MARGO
(eyes still on Bill)
Too bad
BILL

(eyes still on Margo)
Im broken up about it

The wine has been poured by now
LLOYD

For some reason you cant just pick
up champagne and drink it
Somebodys got to be very witty
about a toast

(he lifts his glass)
For instance

BILL
(abruptly)
Im going to propose the toast
Without wit With all my heart

Lloyd lowers his glass Theres a little pause

BILL
To Margo To my bride-to-be

MARGO
Glory Hallelujah

LLOYD
Well of all-

KAREN
Margo

BILL
Drink

They drink then burst into a flurry of questions

KAREN
When When are you going to do it

BILL
Tomorrow we meet at City Hall at
ten-
(to Margo)

- and youre going to be on time

MARGO
Yes sir

LLOYD
City Hall thats for prize
fighters and reporters - I see a
cathedral a bishop banks of
flowers

BILL
Its only for the license Theres
a three-day wait - blood tests
things like that

MARGO
Ill marry you if it turns out you

have no blood at all

LLOYD
Three days thats for the
bourgeois - I see a midnight
elopement waking up a village
person

KAREN
(to Margo)
What are you going to wear

MARGO
Something simple A fur coat over a
nightgown

BILL

The point is - in the cathedral a
ball park or a penny arcade - we
want to have you two beside us our
nearest and dearest friends

Lloyd fills all the glasses

LLOYD
There are very few moments in life
as good as this Lets remember it
(he lifts his glass)
To each of us and all of us
never have we been more close - may
we never be farther apart

They drink A waiter approaches with a note

WAITER
Mrs Richards

KAREN
Yes

WAITER
For you

Karen stares at it curiously then opens it

LLOYD
Very discreet A note right out in
the open like that Next time tell
your lover to blow smoke rings - or
tap a glass

MARGO
Lloyd I want you to be big about
this the world is full of love

tonight no woman is safe

KAREN
(angrily)
This beats all worlds records for
running standing and jumping gall
She whips the note to Margo who reads it aloud

MARGO
(reading)

Please forgive me for butting into
what seems such a happy occasion -
but its most important that I
speak with you Please - its
underlined - meet me in the
Ladies Room Eve

BILL
I understand she is now the
understudy in there

MARGO
(looking about)
Pass me the empty bottle I may
find her why look Theres
Rasputin

Addison sits near the entrance at a banquette table for two
A crumpled napkin and a wine glass indicate Eves place He
nibbles daintily at some blini

Margo hails a passing captain

MARGO
Encore du champagne

CAPTAIN
More champagne Miss Channing

MARGO
Thats what I said bub

LLOYD
(to Karen)
After all maybe she just wants to
apologize

KAREN
I have no possible interest in
anything shed have to say

BILL
But what could she say Thats what
fascinates me

LLOYD
Go on - find out

MARGO
Karen in all the years of our
friendship I have never let you go
to the Ladies Room alone But now
I must I am busting to know what
goes on in that feverish little
brain waiting there

KAREN
Well all right

She gets up and goes The CAMERA takes her past Addisons
table He rises in polite surprise

ADDISON
Karen How nice

She walks past him without a word He smiles looks toward
the group He raises his glass in a toast

Margo responds to the toast by waving an onion with a grand
flourish then eating it

BILL
Very effective But why take it out
on me

He eats one in self-defense
INT LADIES ROOM - STORK CLUB - NIGHT

Never having been I cant say what it looks like It is to
be hoped that there is an outer and inner room We are
concerned with the outer

There is an attendant in charge and a constantly changing
flow of ladies who pause to make various repairs All cafe
society - including one young drunk stretched out under a
mink coat and a wet towel

There are two chairs - or a banquette - in a corner Eve
waits there She rises as Karen approaches

EVE
I was wondering whether youd come
at all

KAREN

Dont get up

(she smiles grimly)
And dont act as if I were the
queen mother

EVE
I dont expect you to be pleasant

KAREN
I dont intend to be

EVE
Cant we sit down Just for a
minute
She sits down Karen remains standing

EVE
Ive got a lot to say And none of
it is easy

KAREN
There cant be very much-

EVE
Oh but there is-

KAREN
- and easy or not I wont believe
a word

EVE

Why shouldnt you
(a pause)
Please sit down

Karen sits reluctantly and rigidly

EVE

You know Ive always considered
myself a very clever girl Smart
Good head on my shoulders that
sort of thing never the wrong word
at the wrong time but then Id
never met Addison deWitt

(another pause)
I remember once I had a tooth
pulled They gave me some
anaesthetic - I dont remember the
name - and it affected me ina
strange way I heard myself saying
things I wasnt even thinking as
if my mind were someplace outside
of my body and couldnt control
what I did or said-

KAREN
(leading her on)
- and you felt just like that
talking to Addison

EVE
(nods)

In a way You find yourself trying
to say what you mean but somehow
the words change - and they become
his words - and suddenly youre not
saying what you mean but what he
means-
KAREN
(sharply)
Do you expect me to believe that
you didnt say any of those things -
that they were all Addison

EVE
No I dont expect you to believe
anything Except that the
responsibility is mine And the
disgrace

KAREN
Lets not get over-dramatic

EVE
(smiles grimly)

Youve really got a low opinion of
me havent you Well Ill give
you some pleasant news Ive been
told off in no uncertain terms all
over town Miss Channing should be
happy to hear that To know how
loyal her friends are - how much
more loyal they are than she had a
right to expect me to be

She turns away from Karen Karens embarrassed

KAREN
Eve dont cry

EVE
(turned away)
Im not crying

KAREN
Tell me How did your lunch turn
out - with the man from Hollywood

EVE
Some vague promises of a test
thats all - if a particular part
should come along one of those

things-

KAREN
But the raves about your
performance-

EVE

- an understudys performance

KAREN
Well I think youre painting the
picture a little darker than it is
really If nothing else - and dont
underestimate him - you have a
powerful friend in Addison

EVE
Hes not my friend You were my
friends

KAREN

He can help you

EVE
I wish Id never met him Id like
him to be dead I want my friends
back

This time she does cry Softly miserably Karen looks about
A pause She puts an arm around Eve

KAREN
Eve I - I dont think you meant to
cause unhappiness But you did
More to yourself perhaps - as it
turned out - than to anyone else

EVE
Ill never get over it

KAREN
(smiles)

Yes you will You Theater people
always do Nothing is forever in
the Theater Love or hate success
or failure - whatever it is its
here it flares up and burns hot -
and then its gone

EVE
I wish I could believe that

KAREN

Give yourself time Dont worry too
much about what people think
youre very young and very
talented

(she gets up her hand

still on Eves shoulder)

and believe it or not if

theres anything I can do-

Eve has reached up to take Karens hand She holds it now as
she turns slowly to face her

EVE
There is something

Karen stares down at her Eves eyes burn into tears Karen
is caught fascinated by them
KAREN
I think I know

EVE
Something most important you can
do

KAREN

You want to play Cora You want
me to tell Lloyd I think you should
play it

EVE
If you told him so hed give me
the part He said he would

KAREN
After all youve said dont you
know the part was written for
Margo

EVE

It could have been - fifteen years
ago Its my part now

KAREN
You talk just as Addison said you
did

EVE

Cora is my part Youve got to
tell Lloyd its for me

KAREN
I dont think anything in the world
could make me say that

She turns away again but Eves grip is like a vise

EVE
Addison wants me to play it

KAREN
Over my dead body

EVE

(cold relentless)
That wont be necessary Addison
knows how Margo happen to miss that
performance - how I happened to
know shed miss it in time to call
him and notify every paper in
town

(Karen stops struggling)

its quite a story

Addison could make quite a thing of
it - imagine how snide and vicious
he could get and still write
nothing but the truth I had a time
persuading him

(she smiles now)

youd better sit down You look

a bit wobbly

(Karen sits)
If I play Cora Addison will
never tell what happened - in or
out of print A simple exchange of
favors And Im so happy I can do
something for you - at long last

(Karen covers her face

with her hands)
Your friendship with Margo - your
deep close friendship - what would
happen to it do you think if she
knew the chap trick youd played on
her - for my benefit And you and
Lloyd - how long even in the
Theater before people forgot what
happened - and trusted you again

(now Eve gets up)
No it would be so much easier on
everyone concerned if I were to
play Cora And so much better
theater too

Karen looks up slowly

KAREN
A part in a play Youd do all that
- just for a part ina play

EVE
(smiles)
Id do much more - for a part that
good

She leaves Karen is alone
INT CUB ROOM - NIGHT
Eve enters and slides in beside Addison

ADDISON
Hungry

EVE
Just some coffee

ADDISON
(pours)
Im not surprised After all that
humble pie
EVE
Nothing of the kind Karen and I
had a nice talk

ADDISON
Heart to heart Woman to woman
Including a casual reference to the
part of Cora - and your hopes of
playing it

EVE
I discussed it very openly I told
her that I had spoken to Lloyd -
and that he was interested

ADDISON
She mentioned of course that
Margo expects to play the part

EVE
Oddly enough - she didnt say a
word about Margo Just that shell
be happy to do what she can to see
that I play the part

Addison puffs at his cigarette bemused

ADDISON
Just like that eh

EVE
Just like that

ADDISON
(thoughtfully)
Do you know Eve - sometimes I
think you keep things from me

Eves feelings are hurt

EVE
I dont think thats funny

ADDISON
It wasnt meant to be

EVE
I confide in you and rely on you
more than anyone Ive ever known
To say a thing like that now -
without any reason - when I need
you more than ever

ADDISON
(breaks in)
I hope you mean what you say Eve
I intend to hold you to it
Their eyes meet

ADDISON
We have a great deal in common it
seems to me

They both look as Karen passes them on her way back to her
table

GROUP as Karen joins them Another bottle of champagne has
come and almost gone - theres a fine cheery feeling among
them Margo in particular is cheery A pause Karen downs a
glass of champagne

LLOYD
- well What happened

KAREN
Nothing much She apologized

MARGO
With tears

KAREN
With tears

MARGO

But not right away First the
business of fighting them off chin
up stout fella

KAREN
Check

MARGO
Very classy stuff lots of
technique-

LLOYD

You mean - all this time - shed
done nothing but apologize Whatd

you say

KAREN
Not much

MARGO
Groom-

(Bill says huh)
- may I have a wedding present

BILL
What would you like Texas

MARGO
I want everybody to shut up about
Eve Just shut up about Eve thats
all I want Give Karen more wine
(blissfully)

never have I been so happy
Isnt this a lovely room The Cub
Room What a lovely clever name
Where the elite meet Never have I
seen so much elite - and all with
their eyes on me Waiting for me to
crack that little gnome over the
noggin with a bottle But not
tonight Even Eve I forgive Eve
there they go

They all look
ADDISON AND EVE they get up and go without looking back
GROUP they watch for an instant

MARGO
There goes Eve Eve evil Little
Miss Evil But the evil that men do
- how does it go groom Something
about the good they leave behind -
I played it once in rep in Wilkes
Barre

BILL
Youve got it backwards Even for
Wilkes-Barre

MARGO
You know why I forgive Eve Because
shes left good behind - the four
of us together like this its
Eves fault - I forgive her

Karens reactions are of course most important Knowing
what shes done to Margo - wondering how to do what she must

MARGO
and Bill Especially Bill Eve
did that too

LLOYD
You know she probably means well
after all

MARGO
She is a louse

BILL
(to Lloyd)
Never try to outguess Margo

MARGO
Groom

BILL
Yes dear

MARGO
You know what Im going to be

BILL
A cowboy

MARGO
A married lady

BILL
With the paper to prove it

MARGO
Im going to have a home Not just
a house Im afraid to stay in
and a man to go with it Ill look
up at six oclock - and there hell
be remember Karen

KAREN
(quietly)
I remember

MARGO
(to Bill)
Youll be there wont you

BILL
(grins)
Often enough to keep the franchise

MARGO

A foursquare upright downright
forthright married lady thats
for me And no more make believe
Off stage or on remember Lloyd

(Lloyd nods)
I mean it now Grown-up women
only I might even play a mother -
only one child of course not over
eight

(they all smile)
Lloyd will you promise not to be
angry with me

LLOYD
(smiles)
That depends

MARGO
I mean really deeply angry
LLOYD
I dont think I could be

MARGO
Well I dont want to play Cora

KAREN
(explodes)
What

Margo misinterprets her vehemence

Lloyd never gets to answer Because Karen before anyone can

stop her

Margo removes the champagne glass from in front

FADE OUT

MARGO
(hastily)

Now wait a minute youre always so
touchy about his plays it isnt
the part - its a great part Anda
fine play But not for me anymore -
not a foursquare upright
downright forthright married lady

LLOYD
Whats your being married got to do
with it

MARGO

It means Ive finally got a life to
live I dont have to play parts
Im too old for - just because Ive
got nothing to do with my nights
(then quietly)

I know youve made plans Ill make
it up to you believe me Ill tour
a year with this one anything -
only you do understand - dont you
Lloyd

bursts into hysterical laughter

LLOYD
Whats so funny

KAREN
Nothing

BILL
Nothing

KAREN
Everything everythings so
funny

of Karen
FADE IN
INT THEATER - CURRAN THEATER - DAY

Karen is seated unobtrusively in a rear lower box Lloyd sits
beside Max up front

On stage the play is on its feet Eve plays a dramatic
scene with a young man They carry sides but do not consult
them

As she speaks Eve moves upstage turns to face the young man
who is forced to turn his back to the auditorium

Bill calls a halt He indicates to Eve that she was to have
remained downstage

Eve seems to be at a loss She looks at Lloyd
Lloyd rises says that he told her to make the change

Bill comes down to the footlights to tell him to stick to
writing hell do the directing It mounts swiftly to a
screaming fight Bill throws the script out into the
auditorium takes his coat and stalks off

Eve runs after him Max retrieves the script Lloyd remains
adamant Karen has risen in dismay

Eve drags Bill back Without looking at Lloyd he takes the
script from Max tells the actors to pick up where they left
off

Eve whispers to Lloyd from the stage Lloyd smiles
mollified sits down again with Max

Karen walks up the side aisle out of the theater

KARENS VOICE
Lloyd never got around somehow -
to asking me whether it was all
right with me for Eve to play
Cora Bill oddly enough
refused to direct the play at first
- with Eve in it Lloyd and Max
finally won him over Margo never
came to a rehearsal too much to do
around the house she said Id
never known Bill and Lloyd to fight
as bitterly and as often and
always over some business for Eve
or a move or the way she read a
speech but then Id never known
Lloyd to meddle as much with Bills
directing - as far as it affected
Eve that is somehow Eve kept
them going Bill stuck it out - and
Lloyd seemed happy - and I thought
it might be best if I skipped
rehearsals from then on

INT RICHARDS BEDROOM - NIGHT

It is a lovely large room Two double beds not alongside
each other and each with an extension phone beside it In
addition to the door to the living room there are two more -
to separate dressing rooms and baths Lloyd is asleep But
not Karen She turns restlessly finally sits up lights a
cigarette

KARENS VOICE
It seemed to me I had known always
that it would happen - and here it
was
It felt helpless that helplessness
you feel when you have no talent to
offer - outside of loving your
husband How could I compete
Everything Lloyd loved about me he
had gotten used to long ago

The phone jangles suddenly startling her It wakes Lloyd up
Karen answers

KAREN
Hello who whos calling Mr
Richards

INT ROOMING HOUSE - NIGHT

A girl in a wrapper at a wall phone Her hairs in curlers
Shes frightened

GIRL
My name wouldnt mean anything I
room across the hall from Eve
Harrington and she isnt well
Shes been crying all night and
hysterical and she doesnt want a
doctor

RICHARDS BEDROOM Lloyd is sitting on the edge of the bed
looking over

LLOYD
Who is it Whats it all about

KAREN
(into phone)
Did Miss Harrington tell you to
call Mr Richards

Lloyd picks up his phone
ROOMING HOUSE

GIRL
No Eve didnt say to call him but
I remembered I saw Mr Richards
with her a couple of times - and I
thought they being such good
friends

RICHARDS BEDROOM

LLOYD
(into phone)
Hellohello this is Lloyd
Richards Where is Eve Let me talk
to her-

ROOMING HOUSE

GIRL
Shes up in her room Mr Richards
I really hate to bother you like
this but the way Eves been
feeling - Im just worried sick
what with her leaving for New Haven
tomorrow and everything

RICHARDS BEDROOM

LLOYD
Tell her not to worry - tell her
Ill be right over

ROOMING HOUSE

GIRL
Ill tell her Mr Richards

She hangs up As she moves from the phone the ANGLE WIDENS
to disclose Eve at the foot of the stairs The girls smile at
each other They go upstairs arm in arm

RICHARDS BEDROOM Karen is still in bed phone still in her
hand She hangs up swings her legs out puts out her
cigarette gets into a robe The open door and light of the
dressing room tell us where Lloyd is

Karen walks to the door starts to say something changes her
mind She crosses to a table lights a fresh cigarette comes
back to the door

KAREN
(finally)
Arent you broadening the duties

of a playwright just a bit Rushing
off in the middle of the night
like a country doctor
No answer except the opening and closing of drawers

KAREN
What would you do if instead of
Eve the leading man had called up
to say her was hysterical

Still no answer Her tension increasing Karen goes back to
the table snubs out the fresh cigarette then strides
swiftly back to the open door

KAREN
Lloyd I dont want you to go

Now Lloyd appears Hes in flannels and a sport shirt with
no tie Hes confused and guilty and tortured

LLOYD
I didnt think you would It seems
to me Karen that for some tine
now youve been developing a deep
unconcern for the feeling of human
being in general-

KAREN
Im a human being Ive got some

LLOYD
(goes right on)
- and for my feelings in
particular For my play my career -
and now for a frightened
hysterical girl on the eve of her
first night in the Theater

He goes back into his room

KAREN
Have you forgotten about Eve What
she is what shes done

LLOYD
Old wives tales born of envy and
jealousy And a phobia against
truth

KAREN
Then tell me this isnt true That
your concern for your play and
career is one thing - and that poor
frightened hysterical girl another -
and that your concern for her has
nothing to do with either your play
or your career

Lloyd comes out wearing a jacket He crosses to the door
Karen after him

KAREN

That first last and foremost -
your reason for going now is that
you want to be with Eve Three in
the morning or high noon - play or
no play - wife or no wife

(Lloyd stops at the door)
Isnt it true Lloyd

Lloyd goes out Karen looks after him despairing
EXT SHUBERT THEATER - NEW HAVEN - DAY

The theater is but a few doors from the TAFT HOTEL The
marquee announces a new play by Lloyd Richards presented by
Max Fabian opening tonight

Addison and Eve stand before the theater admiring her photo
on a lobby display None of the actors are starred

ADDISONS VOICE
To the Theater world - New Haven
Connecticut is a short stretch of
sidewalk between the Shubert
Theater and the Taft Hotel
surrounded by what looks very much
like a small city It is here that
managers have what are called out
of-town openings - which are
openings for New Yorkers who want
to go out of town

They start for the hotel - Eves arm through Addisons

EVE
What a day - what a heavenly day

ADDISON
D-day

EVE
Just like it

ADDISON

And tomorrow morning you will have
won your beachhead on the shores of
Immortality

EVE
(grins)
Stop rehearsing your column
Isnt it strange Addison
I thought Id be panic-stricken
want to run away or something
Instead I cant wait for tonight
to come To come and go

ADDISON
Are you that sure of tomorrow

EVE
Arent you

ADDISON
Frankly - yes

Theyve arrived in front of the hotel

EVE
Itll be a night to remember Itll
bring to me everything Ive ever
wanted The end of an old road -
and the beginning of a new one

ADDISON
All paved with diamonds and gold

EVE
You know me better than that

ADDISON
Paved with what then

EVE
Stars

She goes in Addison follows her
INT CORRIDOR - TAFT HOTEL - DAY

Addison accompanies Eve along the corridor to her door

EVE
What time

ADDISON
Almost four

EVE

Plenty of time for a nice long nap -
we rehearsed most of last night

ADDISON
You could sleep too couldnt you

EVE
Why not

Theyve arrived at her door She opens it

ADDISON
The mark of a true killer
(he holds out his hand)
Sleep tight rest easy - and come
out fighting

EVE
Whyd call me a killer

ADDISON
Did I say killer I meant champion
I get my boxing terms mixed

He turns to go After a few steps-

EVE
(calling)
Addison-
(he pauses)
- come on in for just a minute
wont you Theres Ive got
something to tell you

Addison turns curiously and enters behind her
INT EVES SUITE - TAFT HOTEL - DAY

Old-fashioned dreary and small The action starts in the
living room and continues to the bedroom

Addison closes the door crosses to a comfortable chair

ADDISON
Suites are for expense accounts
Arent you being extravagant

EVE
Max is paying for it He and Lloyd
had a terrific row but Lloyd
insisted well Can I fix you a
drink

She indicates a table elaborately stocked with liquor
glasses etc Addisons eyebrows lift

ADDISON
Also with the reluctant compliments
of Max Fabian

EVE
Lloyd I never have any and he
likes a couple of drinks after we
finish - so he sent it up

ADDISON
Some plain soda
(Eve starts to fix it)
Lloyd must be expecting a record
run in New Haven
EVE
Thats for tonight Youre invited
Were having everyone up after the
performance

ADDISON
Were

EVE
Lloyd and I

She carries the soda to him sits on an ottoman at his feet

ADDISON
I find it odd that Karen isnt here
for the opening dont you

He sips his soda and puts away carefully avoiding a look at
Eve As he looks back-

EVE
Addison

ADDISON
(blandly)
Shes always been so fantastically
devoted to Lloyd I would imagine
that only death or destruction
could keep her-

EVE
(breaks in)
Addison just a few minutes ago
When I told you this would be a
night to remember - that it would
bring me everything I wanted-

ADDISON
(nods)
- something about an old road
ending and a new one starting -
paved with stars

EVE
I didnt mean just the Theater

ADDISON
What else

Eve gets up crosses to look out over the Common

EVE
(her back to him)
Lloyd Richards Hes going to leave
Karen Were going to be married
For just a flash Addisons eyes narrow coldly viciously
Then they crinkle into a bland smile

ADDISON
So thats it Lloyd Still just the
Theater after all

EVE
(turns shocked)
Its nothing of the kind Lloyd
loves me I love him

ADDISON
I know nothing about Lloyd and his
loves - I leave those to Louisa May
Alcott But I do know you

EVE
Im in love with Lloyd

ADDISON
Lloyd Richards is commercially the
most successful playwright in

America-

EVE
You have no right to say such
things

ADDISON

- and artistically the most
promising Eve dear this is
Addison

Eve drops her shocked manner like a cape Her face lights up -
she crosses back to the ottoman

EVE
Addison wont it be just perfect
Lloyd and I - theres no telling

how far we can go hell write
great plays for me Ill make them
be great

(as she sits)
Youre the only one Ive told the
only one that knows except Lloyd
and me

ADDISON
and Karen

EVE
She doesnt know

KAREN
She knows enough not to be here
EVE
But not all of it - not that Lloyd
and I are going to be married

ADDISON
(thoughtfully)
I see And when was this unholy
alliance joined

EVE
We decided the night before last
before we came up here

ADDISON
(increasingly tense)
Was the setting properly romantic -
the lights on dimmers gypsy
violins off stage

EVE
The setting wasnt romantic but
Lloyd was He woke me up at three
in the morning banging on my door -
he couldnt sleep he told me -
hes left Karen he couldnt go on
with the play or anything else
until I promised to marry him we
sat and talked until it was light
He never went home

ADDISON
You sat and talked until it was
light
EVE
(meaningly)

We sat and talked Addison I want
a run of the play contract

ADDISON
(quietly)
There never was therell never be
another like you

EVE
(happily)
Well say something - anything
Congratulations skol - good work
Eve

Addison rises slowly to his full height As Eve watches him
as her eyes go up to his her smile fades-

ADDISON
What do you take me for

EVE
Eve gets

(cautiously)
I dont know what I take you for
anything

ADDISON
(moving away)

It is possible - even conceivable -
that youve confused me with that
gang of backward children youve
been playing tricks on - that you
have the same contempt for me that
you have for them

EVE
Im sure you mean something by
that Addison but I dont know
what

ADDISON
Look closely Eve its time you
did I am Addison deWitt Im
nobodys fool Least of all -
yours

EVE
I never intended you to be

ADDISON
Yes you did You still do

up now

EVE
I still dont know what youre
getting at Right now I want to
take my nap Its important that I-

ADDISON
(breaks in)
- its important right now that we
talk Killer to killer

EVE
(wisely)
Champion to champion

ADDISON
Not with me youre no champion
Youre stepping way up in class

EVE
Addison will you please say what
you have to say plainly and
distinctly - and then get out so I
can take my nap

ADDISON
Very well plainly and distinctly
Although I consider it unnecessary -
because you know as well as I what
I am about to say
(they are now facing each
other)
Lloyd may leave Karen but he will
not leave Karen for you

EVE
What do you mean by that

ADDISON
More plainly and more distinctly I
Have not come to New Haven to see
the play discuss your dreams or
to pull the ivy from the walls of
Yale I have come to tell you that
you will not marry Lloyd - or
anyone else - because I will not
permit it

EVE
What have you got to do with it

ADDISON
Everything Because after tonight
you will belong to me

EVE
I cant believe my ears

ADDISON
A dull cliche

EVE
Belong - to you That sound
medieval - something out of an old
melodrama

ADDISON
So does the history of the world
for the past twenty years I dont
enjoy putting it as bluntly as
this frankly I had hoped that you
would somehow have known - have
taken it for granted that you and
I

EVE
taken it for granted That you
and I

She smiles Then she chuckles then laughs A mistake
Addison slaps her sharply across the face

ADDISON
(quietly)
Remember as long as you live never
to laugh at me At anything or
anyone else - but never at me

Eve eyes him coldly goes to the door throws it open

EVE
Get out

Addison walks to the door closes it

ADDISON
Youre too short for that gesture
Besides it went out with Mrs
Fiske

EVE
Then if you wont get out Ill
have you thrown out

She goes to the phone

ADDISON
Dont pick it up Dont even put
your hand on it

She doesnt Her back is to him Addison smiles

ADDISON
Something told you to do as I say
didnt it That instinct is worth
millions you cant buy it cherish
it Eve When that alarm goes off
go to your battle stations

He comes up behind her Eve is tense and wary

ADDISON
Your name is not Eve Harrington It
is Gertrude Slescynski

EVE
What of it

ADDISON
It is true that your parents were
poor They still are And they
would like to know how you are -
and where They havent heard from
you for three years

EVE
(curtly)
What of it

She walks away Addison eyes her keenly
ADDISON
A matter of opinion Granted It is
also true that you worked in a
brewery But life in the brewery
was apparently not as dull as you
pictured it As a matter of fact
it got less and less dull - until
you bosss wife had your boss
followed by detectives

EVE
(whirls on him)
She never proved anything not a
thing

ADDISON
But the 500 you got to get out of
town brought you straight to New
York - didnt it

Eve turns and runs into the bedroom slamming the door
Addison opens it follows close after her he can be seen
in the bedroom shouting at Eve who is offscene

ADDISON
That 500 brought you straight to
New York - didnt it

INT BEDROOM - DAY
Eve trapped in a corner of the room

EVE
She was a liar she was a liar

ADDISON
Answer my question Werent you
paid to get out of town

Eve throws herself on the bed face down bursts in tears
Addison merciless moves closer

ADDISON

Fourth There was no Eddie - no
pilot - and youve never been
married That was not only a lie
but an insult to dead heroes and to
the women who loved them

(Eve sobbing puts her

hands over her ears

Addison closer pulls

them away)

Fifth San Francisco has no
Shubert Theater and North Shore
youve never been to San Francisco
That was a stupid lie easy to
expose not worthy of you
Eve twists to look up at him her eyes streaming

EVE
I had to get in to meet Margo I
had to say something be somebody
make her like me

ADDISON
She did like you she helped and
trusted you You paid her back by
trying to take Bill away

EVE
Thats not true

ADDISON
I was there I saw you and heard
you through the dressing room door

Eve turns face down again sobbing miserably

ADDISON
You used my name and my column to
blackmail Karen into getting you
the part of Cora - and you lied
to me about it

EVE
(into the bed)
No-no-no

ADDISON

I had lunch with Karen not three
hours ago As always with women who
want to find out things she told
more than she learned

(he lets go of her hands)

- do you want to change your

story about Lloyd beating at your
door the other night

Eve covers her face with her hands

EVE
Please please

Addison get off the bed looks down at her

ADDISON
That I should want you at all
suddenly strikes me as the height
of improbability But that in
itself is probably the reason
Youre an improbable person Eve
and so am I We have that in
Eve lies

common Also a contempt for

humanity an inability to love or

be loved insatiable ambition - and
talent We deserve each other Are

you listening to me

listlessly now her tear-stained cheek against the
coverlet She nods

ADDISON
Then say so

EVE
Yes Addison

ADDISON

And you realize - you agree how
completely you belong to me

EVE
Yes Addison

ADDISON

Take your nap now And good luck

for tonight

He starts out

He goes out

EVE
(tonelessly)
I wont play tonight
(Addison pauses)
I couldnt Not possibly I
couldnt go on

ADDISON
(smiles)
Couldnt go on Youll give the
performance of your life

The CAMERA REMAINS on Eves forlorn tear

stained face Her eyes close she goes to sleep

INT DINING HALL - SARAH SIDDONS SOCIETY - NIGHT

THE STOPPED ACTION of Eve reaching out for the award The

applause

THE ACTION picks up where it left off

from the

and bulb-popping still going on

ADDISONS VOICE

And she gave the performance of her

life And it was a night to
remember that night

Aged Actor kisses him tenderly

her bosom and waits for quiet

Eve accepts the award

folds the award to
She speaks with assurance

EVE

Honored members of Sarah Siddons
Society distinguished guests
ladies and gentlemen What is there
for me to say Everything wise and
witty has long since been said - by
minds more mature and talents far
greater than mine For me to thank
you as equals would be presumptuous
- I am an apprentice in the Theater
and have much to learn from you
all I can say only that I am proud
and happy and that I regard this
great honor not so much as an award
for what I have achieved but as a
standard to hold against what I
have yet to accomplish

(applause)
And further I regard it as
bestowed upon me only in part The
larger share belongs to my friends
in the Theater - and to the Theater
itself which has given me all I
have In good conscience I must
give credit where credit is due To
Max Fabian-

MAX sits erect beaming proudly

EVES VOICE
- dear Max Dear sentimental
generous courageous Max Fabian -
who took a chance on an unknown
untried amateur

EVE after applause greets Max

EVE
And to my first friend in the
Theater - whose kindness and
graciousness I shall never
forget Karen - Mrs Lloyd
Richards

yet modestly and humbly

KAREN resumes her doodling as applause breaks out for her

MARGO

EVES VOICE
and it was Karen who first
brought me to one whom I had always
idolized - and who was to become my
benefactor and champion A great
actress and a great woman - Margo
Channing

part of Eves tribute has been over her CLOSE-UP

She
smiles grimly in reaction to the applause
EVE looks to her right waits for the applause to die

EVE
My director - who demanded always a
little more than my talent could
provide-

BILL seated at the speakers table He has his award before
him - a smaller one He puts out a cigarette expressionlessly
as the applause breaks out

EVE
- but who taught me patiently and
well Bill Sampson

LLOYD sits beside Bill He too has a smaller award As Eve
speaks he throws her a brief glance

EVES VOICE
And one without whose great play
and faith in me this night would
never have been How can I repay
Lloyd Richards

EVE waits for the applause to die

EVE
Hoe can I repay the many others So
many that I couldnt possibly name
them all

ADDISON smiles approvingly

EVES VOICE
whose help guidance and advice
have made this the happiest night
of my life possible

EVE stares at the award for an instant as if fighting for
self-control

EVE
Although I am going to Hollywood
next week to make a film - do not
think for a moment that I am
leaving you How could I For my
heart is here in the Theater - and
three thousand miles are too far to
be away from ones heart
Ill be back to claim it - and
soon That is if you want me back

Another storm of applause Much ad lib shouting as Bill and
Lloyd are summoned to pose beside her for more pictures
People are thronging out The Aged Actor shouts above the
hubbub

AGED ACTOR
A good night to all - and to alla
good night

Eve disengages herself from the photographers makes her way
toward Addisons table Bill and Lloyd follow CAMERA
FOLLOWS Lloyd to Karen They kiss He gives her the award

LLOYD
For services rendered - beyond the
whatever-it-is-of-duty darling

Max bustles into the SHOT

MAX
Come on Im the host I gotta get
home before the guests start
stealing the liquor

She and Lloyd follow Max Addison and Eve are on their way
Lloyd goes right by Karen pauses at Eve

KAREN
Congratulations Eve

EVE
Thank you Karen

Karen goes Eve is being constantly congratulated Some ad
lib about seeing her at Maxs party

MAX
(to Addison)
Im giving her a very high-class
party It aint like a rehearsal
she dont have to be late

ADDISON
As soon as the peasants stop pawing
her

Max hurries out Margo and Bill step into the SHOT Eve turns
from a well-wisher to face her

MARGO
nice speech Eve But I
wouldnt worry too much about your
heart You can always put that
award where your heart ought to be

Eve looks at her wordlessly Margo and Bill leave Addison
and Eve are alone The tables about them are empty Suddenly
her face becomes expressionless her eyes dull she glances
at the table
EVE
I dont suppose theres a drink
left

ADDISON
You can have one at Maxs

EVE
(sits)
I dont think Im going

ADDISON
(sighs)
Why not

EVE
Because I dont want to

ADDISON
(patiently)
Max has gone to a great deal of
trouble its going to be an
elaborate party and its for you

EVE
No its not
(she holds up the award)
Its for this

ADDISON
Its the same thing isnt it

EVE
Exactly
(she gives him the award)
Here Take it to the party instead
of me

ADDISON
Youre being childish

A well-wisher rushes up to Eve with an Eve darling Im so
happy Eve rises thanks her graciously Then she pulls her
wrap over her shoulder

EVE
Im tired I want to go home

ADDISON
(curtly)
Very well I shall drop you and go
on to the party I have no
intention of missing it

They exit from the room now empty of everything but tables
waiters and the usual banquet debris
EXT PARK AVENUE - NIGHT

various stages of being packed Eve tosses her wrap on the
bed goes through the foyer to the living room

She turns on the light in the living room CAMERA FOLLOWS her
to a smart small bar where she fixes a stiff drink As she

A young girl asleep in a chair wakes with a jump She
stares at Eve horror-stricken

EVE

Eve starts for the phone The girl rises in panic

GIRL

GIRL
I hid outside in the hall till the
maid came to turn down your bed
She mustve forgot something and
when she went to get it she left
the door open I sneaked in and hid
till she finished Then I just
looked around - and pretty soon I
was afraid somebodyd notice the
lights were on so I turned them off
- and then I guess I fell asleep

EVE
You were just looking around

GIRL

Phoebe smiles shyly Addison closes the door Phoebe stares

She takes the award into the bedroom sets it on a trunk As

listens Then quietly she puts on the wrap and picks up the

grace and infinite dignity she holds the award to her and
bows again and again as if to the applause of a multitude

FADE OUT
