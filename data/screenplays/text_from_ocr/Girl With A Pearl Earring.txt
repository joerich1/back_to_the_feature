INT GRIETS HOUSE DAY
A bare white wall Sunlight falls softly through an open window

Sounds from outside water-lap against stone a woman calls a
greeting wooden clogs on cobbles

The plaster is roughly finished There are blue grey shadows a
fuzz of brown dust pale cream highlights

Inside the house quiet noises the swish of a scrubbing brush on
stone a rocking chair creaking to and fro a knife chopping

CLOSE ON A kitchen knife sharp-edged pitted black slices
through white-green onion rings juice flecking the blade
Slivers of onion pile up on a dark wood chopping board tiny
threads of yellow-green in the white Reflected for a moment
before the blade sweeps them away

EXT VERMEER HOUSE DAY
A handsome Dutch town house red-brick three storeys high

The front door opens and a MAN and WOMAN come out His clothes
are dark and fine his face half-hidden by a wide hat She is
ripely pregnant her belly large against the swathes of her fine
velvet dress She leans on his arm for support but still leads
the way

CAPTION OVER DELFT 1664
EXT DELFT STREETS DAY

As they walk through the prosperous town they are greeted and
bowed to people of consequence He nods she smiles and waves
to acquaintances blonde curls dancing

INT GRIETS HOUSE DAY

Splitting a red cabbage exposing the white veins between dark
purple leaves A GIRL’S hand small and deft places the cabbage
by the onion

EXT GATES NEAR BRIDGE DAY

The couple cross a bridge over the canal turn into narrower
streets poorer houses tightly-packed WOMEN in white caps and
aprons over dark clothes look up from scrubbing front door
steps WORKING MEN raise their hats He still nods she ignores
them

A BOY (FRANS) leans on the bridge watching from under a mop of

blond curls The moment they are gone he is off - racing down
the street cutting through an alleyway to get ahead of them

INT GRIETS HOUSE DAY

In the kitchen his sister GRIET reacts to the sound of the
door eyes wide lips parted Anticipation uncertainty even
fear A look we will come to recognise

FRANS (0S)
Mother

GRIET pulls the stiff folds of her white cap further forward
round her face resumes her work She is slight a young girl
but with a sureness to her movements which seems older Her
clothes are as plain and severe as the narrow Calvinist room
the fresh-cut vegetables the only stroke of colour She slides
carrots onto the dish absorbed in the pattern she is creating

Her MOTHER comes hurrying into the room in her starched best
clothes A brief irritated glance at the dish

MOTHER
Leave that

GRIET puts down the knife carefully
INT STAIRSATTIC DAY

GRIET hurries up narrow stairs to a room under the eaves so low
even she must stoop Only a shaft of light penetrates the room
In the darkest corner a MAN hunches in a rocking chair

GRIET
Father

GRIET squats in front of him We see his hand is badly
disfigured fingers twisted into a claw skin taut and shiny
pink in places otherwise ridged and gnarled

GRIET (CONTD)
The Guild Master

He nods face in shadow This is an expected event

There is a silent understanding between them GRIET places his
best black jacket on the bed guides his hand with her spread

fingers

After a moment he stops her instead he searches with fumbling
fingers on a shelf by the bed There are several tiles propped
there blue figures on white He feels for one in particular

A girl and boy hand in hand The unmistakable line of GRIET’S
cap FRANS flinging an arm joyfully in the air

He presses it into GRIETS hands a gesture of regret and
apology

November 2003
EXT GRIETS HOUSE DAY

The handsome couple stop at a small house Now they have arrived
the WOMAN hesitates suddenly nervous Her HUSBAND tidies a
strand of her hair then knocks at the door

INT ATTIC DAY

From below the WOMANS VOICE over-loud her heels clattering on
the tiled floor

GRIET’S PATHER lifts his head - the first full sight of his
face taut and twisted as if it had been melted and re-set the
eyes scarred and blind Recent terrible injuries GRIET tries
to ease on his coat

GRIET’S FATHER
I cannot (meet him)

INT KITCHEN DAY

Griet runs into position cheeks flushed and is once more
chopping the vegetables as her MOTHER leads in the visitors

MOTHER
This is Griet

The MAN and WOMAN step down into the kitchen crowding the
Narrow space GRIET looks to her MOTHER for guidance carries on
with her work head bent

The woman CATHARINA talks fast distractedly her hands
forever moving twisting the blonde curls on her neck

CATHARINA
She’s very small You think she is strong
enough We can‘t have a girl who is always worn
out and complaining My mother is worried about
her age And she’s never worked outside the home
before

CATHARINA seems too large for the room too opulent a pearl-
inlaid crucifix dangles heavily between her breasts

MOTHER
She is strong A good girl and willing

CATHARINA
All things considered I suppose it must do but
there will have to be a trial How long should
it be husband

He isnt listening gazing abstractedly at the wall CATHARINA
hurries on

November 2003
CATHARINA (CONTD)
I don’t know I can’t have someone in the house
who won’t pull her weight As it is I
hardly(can make ends meet) There are all the
children to think of too My husband is Guild
Master but we are under no obligation to do
this No obligation at all

MOTHER
(Stony) She works hard

CATHARINA twists her necklace round her fingers Maybe she went
too far

CATHARINA
I mean to say we are sorry for your husband’s
misfortune It was a fire

MOTHER
The kiln exploded Two men died He was spared

CATHARINA crosses herself

CATHARINA
Deo gratias

GRIETS MOTHER stiffens at the Papist words Uncomfortable
silence

MOTHER
(At last) Aye God be thanked

CATHARINA
(Brightly) Well shall we say a month and if she
proves satisfactory- (I will keep her on)

MAN
What are you doing Griet

The MANS voice cuts across his wife’s GRIET looks up
startled He is staring at the vegetables she has arranged in
swathes of colour on the dish GRIET hesitates Her MOTHER
glares at her

GRIET
Cutting vegetables for soup sir

MAN
Why did you lay them out like that

His quietness is intense his cool grey eyes hold hers

GRIET
I- I- Ready for the soup sir

November 2003
CATHARINA snorts GRIET is thrown he has intruded into her
private world Instinctively she pulls her cap forward

MAN
(Gently) Is that the order they go in the pot

GRIET
No sir

The MAN makes a small impatient gesture her answers aren’t what
he wants Her MOTHER is silently urging her

He picks up a piece of onion and turnip

MAN
You have separated the whites And the carrot
and cabbage

GRIET
The colours fight each other

MAN
Ah

His eyebrows go up a small smile GRIET finds she is very
pleased to have pleased him

CATHARINA
Is that how you spend your time - arranging
vegetables

GRIET
(Alarmed)
Oh no Not at all

The MAN drops the shreds of onion and turnip deliberately
careless GRIET’S fingers move to rearrange them but she
controls herself The MAN is still watching

MAN
She might clean my studio

His casual words are shocking to his wife She gasps and turns
too quickly the heavy belly off-balance The kitchen knife
spins off the table and clatters on the ground

MAN (CONTD)
Catharina (Quietly) Be careful

GRIET bends to pick up the knife crouching at his feet her
face inches from the rich trim of his cloak

GRIET
Excuse me Master Vermeer

November 2003
INT BEDROOM DAWN

In the half dark GRIET neatly folds a chemise two starched
aprons a woollen shawl her prayer book FRANS pretends to
sleep as she tiptoes out

INT KITCHEN DAWN

GRIET’S MOTHER pulls oat cakes from the griddle and burns her
hand The only clue to her heartbreak

GRIET holds a wet rag to the burn A rare moment of contact
Recovering herself GRIETS MOTHER folds the oat cakes into a
clean muslin

MOTHER
The food may be strange to your stomach

How can she begin to tell her daughter all she needs to know

MOTHER (CONTD)
Keep clear of their Catholic prayers Or if you
must be with them when they pray stop your
ears

GRIET nods dutifully Her MOTHER hesitates then reaches to the
back of the mantelpiece and brings down a tin box the family
treasure chest It contains some silver coins a few legal
papers and a tortoiseshell comb prettily decorated but old

MOTHER (CONTD)
Had it from my mother the day I was married I
never thought our family would come to this (A
beat) I hear the Master is a good man She
doesn’t know her own mind - someone shouldve
stood up to her before now Shed work you to
death and not even notice

A silence Abruptly she thrusts the comb and cakes at GRIET

MOTHER (CONTD)
Go on then

EXT DELFT MARKET SQUARE DAY

GRIET crosses the empty central square at one end the grand
fagade of the Town Hall at the other the vast brick bulk of the
New Church A few stall holders are setting up

At the brick star in the middle of the square GRIET hesitates
She adjusts the bundle under her arm squares her shoulders
heads across the square into the unknown She looks small and
lonely in the huge space

November 2003
EXT STREET DAY
GRIET walks along an unfamiliar street
EXT VERMEER HOUSE OUDE LANGENDIJCK DAY

On a bench outside sit four well-dressed GIRLS one with a BABY
BOY on her lap Four pairs of watchful eyes assessing her in
silence The oldest MAERTGE (pronounced Mertha) holds a cockle
shell and pipe-stem The youngest(LISBETH) clutching a rag
doll pulls at MAERTGES sleeve impatiently

After a moment the next oldest CORNELIA a thin quick child
with bright red hair snatches them and blows a stream of
bubbles They float upwards glistening in the sunshine

CORNELIA
Tell Tanneke the new maid is here

After a moment MAERTGE decides this is the right thing to do
The little ones run after her GRIET and CORNELIA are left
alone CORNELIA eyes GRIET smirking at her heavy clothing and
clumsy shoes

EXT COURTYARD DAY

TANNEKE the stolid servant of the house leads the way talking
as she goes

TANNEKE

Young Mistress is out this morning I’m to show
you round

She sniffs as if to say this is not a proper part of her
duties Her face is red from the stove cheeks pocked

She indicates the water pump as she leads the way up the steps

TANNEKE (CONTD)
Water for the table

INT WASHING KITCHEN DAY

The WASHING KITCHEN has a big copper cauldron set over a fire
There is a large heap of soiled laundry

TANNEKE
Take water from the canal for laundry its
clean enough this side of town Soda coppers
boiler sand and soap

The middle of the room is full of sheets drying carelessly
arranged Surreptitiously GRIET straightens the nearest sheet

November 2003
TANNEKE (CONTD)
Linen goes out to bleach in the sun In here in
bad weather Flat irons linen press pressing
table Cooking kitchen

She sweeps on down the steps
INT COOKING KITCHEN DAY

TANNEKE’S stronghold dominated by the big cooking fire Pots
and pans none too clean hang on the walls TANNEKE carelessly
throws some onion skins in the grate

TANNEKE
Youre to help serve and clear Buy fish and
meat from the Market when Young Mistress don’t
want to - and that’s often enough

She curves a hand out beyond her own substantial belly

TANNEKE (CONTD)
Youll take your meals with me and the children
Pewter and silver needs polishing every week

She pulls on a rope and pulley to open a trapdoor down to the
cellar

TANNEKE (CONTD)
That’s your sleeping place Scour the pots and
pans Fetch in the milk and butter

No time to pause as TANNEKE leads the way through to another
room

INT GREAT HALL DAY

There are paintings hung thickly on every wall GRIET is
distracted by the dazzling variety of colour and images
Glancing up SHE SEES CORNELIA watching from the upstairs
balcony TANNEKE rattles off instructions

TANNEKE
Dust and polish the woodwork beat the carpets
trim the candlewicks Floor scrubbed morning and
night Young Mistress and Master sleep and have
company here

The furniture is solid and intricately carved the heavy
curtains round the marriage bed richly brocaded But dirty
laundry children’s shoes and toys lie scattered on the floor
disorderly and profuse the opposite of GRIET’S clean bare
home

November 2003
TANNEKE (CONTD)
Air the bedding wash and press the sheets and
linen heat water for Young Mistress to bathe
empty the pots

TANNEKE stands with hands on hips out of breath Her apron is
grey and soiled with grease spots her fingers reddened from
work CORNELIA comes and leans on TANNEKE catlike in her
temporary affection
GRIET
Have you been doing all this yourself Tanneke
The cooking and cleaning and washing
The right words TANNEKE puffs with grim pride
TANNEKE
Nobody but Wouldve put paid to a scrawny
creature like you - day in day out On top of
all the errands bar the Draper and Pothec’ry
She looks around with proprietorial pride

TANNEKE (CONTD)
(Kinder) You’ll get used to it

CORNELIA notices GRIET staring at the paintings

CORNELIA
Do you like them

CORNELIA is looking up at her alert and interested GRIET
smiles back

GRIET
Did your father do all these

CORNELIA laughs scornfully
CORNELIA
No He just sells them All his paintings go
straight away

GRIET feels stupid as she was meant to but TANNEKE is already
bustling out of the room GRIET must hurry after

TANNEKE
This way

INT GREAT HALLMARIA THINS ROOM DAY

TANNEKE opens the door to a smaller but finely furnished room
She allows GRIET to glimpse inside

November 2003

TANNEKE
My Mistress Maria Thins has this room Tis her

owns the house - not her daughter for all her
fine airs

GRIET has an impression -of gaudy Catholic paintings fine velvet
and a prie-Dieu

INT STAIRS TO STUDIO DAY

GRIET follows Tannekes broad back up the stairs TANNEKE points
towards the door at the end of the corridor In spite of herself
she is frightened her voice a whisper

TANNEKE
Youre to clean in there

As GRIET takes a step in that direction

TANNEKE (CONTD)
(scandalised)
Not now Hes painting

INT CELLAR NIGHT

Carrying a night light GRIET goes carefully down the ladder
into the cellar The glint of bottles and jars a broken
footstool a child’s wooden top the paint dim under layers of
dust

A sleeping place with a mattress bolster and blanket has been
made on a low wooden shelf GRIET arranges her few possessions
neatly the prayer book and comb her best lace collar chemises
and aprons her father’s tile Wearily she kneels to pray Her
hands are already red and raw from all the work She is about to
take off her cap when she stops uneasy She looks around the
dark room shadows flickering in the candlelight Suddenly she
sees a face ghostly white

It is a Pieta Mary holding the dead body of Christ the
Virgins face hollow-eyed with grief an arm raised in wild
despair

GRIET looks at it uneasily Then with a quick decisive movement
she takes her spare apron and drapes it over the painting Blows
out her candle Only the faintest glimmer of light comes from
the open trapdoor

In the dark she can hear noises from the household the MASTERS
low voice and laughter She curls up into a ball

INT WASHING KITCHEN - DAY

With an effort GRIET heaves up a full pitcher of water and tips
it into the washing copper A fire blazes under the copper and
GRIET wipes the sweat from her eyes

November 2003

EXT COURTYARD DAY

GRIET scrubs at soiled linen on a washboard There are wet
sheets hanging up a huge pile still to do Her fingers are raw
from the washing soda and hot water

CATHARINA comes out moving slowly with the weight of her belly
Her chemise is already crumpled she looks hot and tired the
blonde curls damp on her neck She watches GRIET working GRIET
turns and dips a curtsey

GRIET
Good Morning Madam

CATHARINA looks annoyed

CATHARINA
Don’t speak till you’re spoken to

But she seems exhausted by this continues to stand there
absently one hand on her belly the other nervously jangling
the household keys which hang at her hip GRIET takes a man’s
shirt from the laundry basket CATHARINA makes an effort

CATHARINA (CONTD)
Tanneke showed you what needs to be done The
laundry and so on

She has barely more experience of this situation than GRIET
GRIET
Yes Madam The shopping when you want (A beat)
And the studio
CATHARINA’S face tightens instantly

CATHARINA
This is only a trial nothing is settled yet

INT HOUSEGROUND FLOOR DAY

GRIET follows CATHARINA through the house carrying a mop
cloths and bucket CORNELIA darts up the stairs ahead of GRIET

INT CORRIDOR OUTSIDE STUDIO DAY

Outside the STUDIO CATHARINA stops catching her breath GRIET
waits in silence CATHARINA stares at the closed door CORNELIA
tugs at her skirts

CATHARINA
Cornelia go down

But when CORNELIA ignores her CATHARINA makes no further effort

She seems trapped helpless A finger twists and twists in her
hair

November 2003

CATHARINA (CONTD)
I My husband You are to clean in there (A
beat) Go in Go in

Hesitantly GRIET sidles past them and opens the door Inside is
a heavy curtain she must push aside CORNELIA tries to follow
but CATHARINA grabs her back as if from the edge of a cliff

INT STUDIO DAY

Now GRIET is inside looking out CATHARINA is stuck in the

doorway holding back the curtain CORNELIA glowering at her
side

CATHARINA
You must disturb nothing leave all just as it
is

Griet holds her mop and pail in the middle of the room not
wanting to start while CATHARINA watches

CATHARINA (CONTD)
Well open the shutters You can’t work in the
dark

GRIET moves from window to window pulling open the heavy wooden
shutters sunlight floods into the room Downstairs the BABY
starts crying CATHARINA pushes her curls back impatiently

CATHARINA (CONTD)
He must not be disturbed (A beat) It’s
important

With these words almost a plea CATHARINA closes the door

Left alone GRIET looks round the STUDIO It is large and
uncluttered unlike the rest of the house Clean palettes and
brushes laid neatly on a table a tall cupboard a half-open
door through into a storeroom

In one corner a table covered with a blue cloth an open letter
the tools of a lady’s toilette laid out in careful disarray A
wooden lay figure (artists dummy) draped in a bright yellow
satin jacket The picture setting

Very carefully anchoring her hand on the corner of the table
GRIET lifts the letter dusts the cloth underneath and replaces
it She uses her fingers as she did with her fathers clothes
moving along methodically fixing lifting and cleaning

A sudden flash of movement alarms her Then she realises it is a
mirror fixed on the wall above the table She stares at
herself The light from the window makes her skin glow she
looks beautiful transfigured She turns away embarrassed

November 2003

She avoids the painting for as long as she can It is not large
But at last she has to look

A woman stands gazing into the mirror as Griet did transfixed
her pearl necklace forgotten in her hands The light falls
softly on her profile and on the objects littering the table in
artful disarray Her yellow satin mantle seems to glow

GRIET stares eyes wide in wonder A chuckle

GRIET swings round to find a LADY watching her from the doorway
She wears a stiff-bodiced black dress encrusted with shiny
beadwork and a wide white collar Under her starched cap her
eyes are shrewd and amused

Instinctively GRIET pulls her own cap forward MARIA THINS
chuckles again puffs on a pipe she is holding in tobacco-
stained fingers

MARIA THINS
Thats right girl You keep it to yourself in
this house

In spite of herself GRIET looks back at the picture

MARIA THINS (CONTD)
Youre not the first to forget your manners in
front of his paintings

GRIET curtseys a mumbled “Madam”

MARIA THINS (CONTD)
Master Van Ruijvens wife

MARIA THINS rakes the room with sharp eyes gathering
information

MARIA THINS (CONTD)
Its like enough - though I never saw so much in
her

GRIET looks from the painting to the setting Although the
objects lie on the table in the same way the map on the wall
and the window are almost the same the effect is not

GRIET
It’s all different More

MARIA THINS nods her head then sighs

MARIA THINS
Should have asked more for it too Do you think
it finished

GRIET studies the painting It certainly looks finished MARIA
THINS laughs harshly

November 2003

MARIA THINS (CONTD)
Three months already Another three before he’s
satisfied no doubt

GRIETS eyes widen in surprise Suddenly MARIA THINS is angry

MARIA THINS (CONTD)
Get along girl You’re not paid to stand
gawping all day

GRIET hurriedly gathers up her cleaning things

EXT COURTYARD DAY

The courtyard is hung with white sheets drying in the sun
GRIET is cleaning silverware her hands and apron are black with
tarnish the cups and bowls beside her sparkle She makes
reflections dance across the walls for the children (also black-
handed) to run after

The GIRLS laugh and squeal the BABY gurgles and tumbles after
them

CORNELIA is quickest her red-gold hair brilliant in the
sunshine She leaps after the will-o-wisp of light

CORNELIA
Ill catch it

GRIET too is fascinated by the light white flame across the
white cloth pale orange on the red brickwork dazzling at the
window

Through the glass she catches a movement in the room above the
light flickers over the MASTERS face

GRIET lets the bowl drop from her hand confused She wants to
pull her cap forward but her hands are dirty The girls fall
silent at once CORNELIA glares

CORNELIA (CONTD)
You made us

GRIET crouches to pick up the bowl When she dares look up again
the window is empty The girls have disappeared

GRIET
(Whispering)
Lisbeth Aleydis

Giggles from amongst the sheets GRIET searches among the linen
to find LISBETH and ALEYDIS happily making filthy hand prints on
the clean sheets

GRIET (CONTD)
Stop that

November 2003

Seeing GRIETS face ALEYDIS stops at once old enough to know
better LISBETH still thinks its a game GRIET pulls aside
another sheet to reveal CORNELIA The sheet is smeared with
grime

CORNELIA
It’s dirty now

CORNELIA makes another hand print and laughs In response GRIET
slaps her sharp on the cheek a black smirch over the red
CORNELIA’S eyes widen in shock but she doesn’t cry

EXT MEAT MARKET - DAY

MAERTGE and CORNELIA accompany TANNEKE and GRIET towards the
grand fagade of the MEAT MARKET stone ox heads over the
classical entrances

INT MEAT MARKET DAY

The Meat Market is bustling with housewives and maids buying
meat Porters carry bloody carcasses along the sawdust-strewn
aisles TANNEKE leads the way importantly to one of the smartest
stalls where the meat has been laid out with gruesome wit a
wreath of kidneys round a calfs head a flower in its hairy
ear PAUL the BUTCHER watches them coming with a shrewd smile

PAUL
What have you got for me Tanneke

TANNEKE
Paul This is Griet the new maid She will
fetch the meat now

With an effort GRIET looks away from the jaunty calf

PAUL
So Griet what takes your fancy Nothings too
good for this family

PAUL winks at her He is a handsome man with greying fair hair
and a broad cheerful face GRIET hesitates looks to TANNEKE
TANNEKE counts off the order on her stubby fingers

TANNEKE
An ox tongue and a dozen chops

PAUL
In the book again

TANNEKE nods curtly she hates this conversation PAUL laughs
holds out the slab of tongue to MAERTGE and CORNELIA

PAUL (CONTD)
What d’you think girls Best tongue in Delft
eh
November 2003

He sticks his own tongue out MAERTGE and CORNELIA giggle GRIET
looks at the chops going into her pail pulls one out holds and
sniffs it

GRIET
This is not fresh The Mistress wont like it

The butcher looks at her in surprise TANNEKE goes red GRIET
holds the meat out stubbornly A long moment then PAUL smiles
broadly

PAUL
Pieter

A young man comes over wiping his hands on his apron He is
tall and broad-shouldered like his father with golden curls an
easy smile GRIET blushes and tightens her grip on the shopping
pail as he looks at her then his father

PAUL (CONTD)
Get the parcel on the cart

PIETER
But that’s for (Mistress Van der Velde)

His father frowns PIETER shrugs and brings over a parcel which
PAUL unwraps and holds out to GRIET She inspects the meat nods
curtly

GRIET
Thats better

TANNEKE turns away crossly Father and son exchange an amused
approving glance

PAUL
Well see you again Griet

INT ENTRANCE HALL DAY

GRIET is sweeping the hall when she suddenly stops Framed in
the doorway she sees a MAN unloading a narrow wooden box Plain
and dark like a child’s coffin VERMEER supervises from the
stairs

INT STAIRS DAY

Carrying her cleaning things Griet cautiously goes into the
studio

INT STUDIO DAY

The room is just as usual except that on a table placed where
the easel would normally stand is the strange wooden box

November 2003

GRIET begins her cleaning but her curiosity is too strong for
her She goes over to the strange box a faint pretence at
cleaning it as she examines it

VERMEER (0S)
You want to look into it

GRIET jumps back guiltily at the disembodied voice VERMEER
laughs and swings down from a trapdoor in the attic

VERMEER (CONTD)
A camera obscura

The strange words mean nothing to GRIET but she is curious as he
looks into the box making adjustments Satisfied he steps
back

VERMEER (CONTD)
Look into the glass

GRIET moves jerkily forward and looks down at the glass plate
inside the box She sees nothing

VERMEER (CONTD)
Put this on Over your head

VERMEER takes his heavy cloak and gently drapes it over her
enveloping her in darkness Like a jewel an image is there in
the dark The painting minute and perfect in glowing colours
Only the real woman is missing

GRIET steps back in confusion the robe falling to the floor
Her face is flushed she drops to her knees grabbing at the
cloak

GRIET
I’m sorry sir I’ll clean it straight away

VERMEER takes it carelessly
VERMEER
Never mind that What did you see
Griet Swallows His questions seems to be asking for more than

mere facts

GRIET
I saw the setting

He starts to fiddle with the box adjusting angles GRIET is
fascinated

GRIET (CONTD)
But

November 2003

VERMEER
Hmm

GRIET
How did it get in there

VERMEER smiles It is as though the sun is shining on her

VERMEER
I was amazed when I first saw it

He beckons her forward to look into the box beside him
VERMEER (CONTD)
Beams of reflected light from the corner pass

through this lens and are bent onto the glass
plate here

GRIET strains to understand With both of them leaning over the
box the image can be faintly seen a ghost GRIET puts her
fingers on the glass

GRIET
Is it real

VERMEER
Its an image - a picture made of light

He starts to shut up the camera GRIET is intrigued

GRIET
Does the box show you what to paint

VERMEER laughs not unkindly
VERMEER
It helps
She frowns confused He is watching her now
VERMEER (CONTD)

You clean the table Griet Why are the things
set on it as they are

GRIET
For the lady To look as if it were her dressing
table

VERMEER

More than that

VERMEER moves impatiently she wishes she knew the answer he
wants Suddenly he strides across the room and removes the
silver bowl stands the powder brush on its bristles GRIET is
startled its a kind of sacrilege to disturb the setting
November 2003

VERMEER (CONTD)
Now look again

He holds the cloak over them both so that as they bend over the
screen their faces are lit by the image on the glass She is
intensely conscious of his face next to hers he is intent on
what he sees She makes herself concentrate The image is
there again this time without the silver bowl at its centre

GRIET
(hesitant)
Its darker And the brush pokes up at the end

A faint sound of approval from VERMEER

VERMEER
The line is broken You can see

INT CELLAR NIGHT

GRIET wakes with a start It is dark a spill of light from the
trapdoor above Wild SHRIEKS fill the house

GRIET tumbles up the steps still tying her apron to find
TANNEKE in the kitchen blowing on the fire agitated

TANNEKE
There you are Fetch some water will you
(Muttering) Blessed Mary Mother of God

More SCREAMS from the Hall MARIA THINS’ calming voice
TANNEKE (CONTD)
(hiding her fear)
Six babies Why does she have to make such a
racket

EXT COURTYARD NIGHT

GRIET pumps water from the cistern cold water splashing into
the metal pans not loud enough to drown CATHARINA’S groans

INT CELLAR NIGHT
GRIET hides on the steps hands over her ears
INT GREAT HALL DAWN

The CHILDREN crowd around their MOTHER and the new BABY (a BOY)
on the bed CATHARINA is radiant pink-cheeked and smiling
TANNEKE looks proud and pleased holding up little JOHANNES to
see his new brother A PRIEST rattles through a blessing a
MIDWIFE clears away bloody cloths GRIET brings wine hesitates
in the doorway

November 2003
MAERTGE
Put it on Papa You must There

VERMEER crawls out from the embrace of his daughters He is

wearing a little velvet “paternity” cap decked with ribbons His

face is flushed hair and clothes rumpled and messy

MARTA THINS taps with her cane startling GRIET who stands
aside at once MARIA THINS watches her daughter and family a
wry smile She has a folded note in her hand

MARIA THINS
Take this invitation to the house of your
masters patron Pieter van Ruijven

EXT VAN RUIJVEN‘S HOUSE DAY

A boat ferries GRIET towards an imposing Renaissance mansion
one of the grandest houses in town

VAN RUIJVENS business occupies the quayside a prosperous
commercial bustle The boat noses into the boathouse

INT VAN RUIJVEN’S GREAT HALL DAY

VAN RUIJVEN reads the letter holding it up to the light from
the window He is richly dressed with longish dark hair and a
moustache hiding a weak mouth and chin

VAN RUIJVEN
So finished at last And the baby too Jans
brood mare Hot-tempered is she your mistress
Hard to handle

He looks up from the note and runs his eyes over GRIET so
blatantly lascivious that GRIET cannot stop herself from
blushing She pulls the points of her cap forward VAN RUIJVEN
laughs

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
She wants an answer you’ll have to wait

He goes over to a carved desk finds a quill and paper GRIET
gazes around the Hall far grander than Vermeers with several
Vermeer paintings among others on the walls

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
A very pretty picture

VAN RUIJVEN is eyeing her GRIET looks down in silence He
pours wine from a porcelain jug

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
Are you thirsty

GRIET is shocked tries to hide it

November 2003

GRIET
No sir

VAN RUIJVEN
I wouldn’t tell

He smiles conspiratorially

GRIET
No sir

He drinks and wipes his moustache glances at CATHARINAs note

VAN RUIJVEN
Hm Honoured guest It was the old womans
idea to combine the birth feast and the viewing
no doubt Shes a tight fist

He scrawls his reply and blots it as he talks

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
Im not turning out for small beer and biscuit
tell her This brat and I deserve a proper
feast Its time they made a show let the world
know their worth You have very wide eyes What
do they call you

GRIET
Griet

VAN RUIJVEN
Your Masters a fine painter Griet Finest in
Delft though I shan’t tell him so He has
painted me Perhaps that will be my epitaph

He laughs at his own joke a rich powerful man of the world
GRIET has never met anyone like him

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
Come take a look

He draws back the curtain to reveal a painting by his desk

GRIET has to move a step or two closer to look at it closer to
him too

The painting by Vermeer is a drinking scene in the foreground
a young woman in a gorgeous red dress (the WOMAN from the
Tavern) smiles towards us while a gentleman (VAN RUIJVEN) gives
her a glass of wine Behind them in a shadowy corner another
man head on hand is bored or asleep

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
Look at that dress you can almost stroke the
satin And the wine winking through the glass
It stank mind you sour as vinegar by the end of
each day - I had to send out for more
November 2003

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
My back ached her hand shook so much he had to
put the napkin there to save the dress

GRIET looks at the painting drinking in the detail fascinated
VAN RUIJVEN stands too close

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
Can you see yourself in such finery my dear
She loved it you know lace and satin tight
against her plump little bubbies heavy silk on
her thighs the gentlemen looking at her My
God she was happy

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
(Offering her wine again)
Sure

VAN RUIJVEN leans towards her in conscious imitation of his
painted self She shakes her head

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
Its a moral lesson of course Theres
Temperance in the window holding the reins the
peeled fruit her silly smile mouth gaping -
only one way things can end

He is right by GRIET now She takes a step back

GRIET
The letter for my Mistress

VAN RUIJVEN drips scarlet sealing wax onto the back of the
letter presses his signet ring onto the molten blob

VAN RUIJVEN
Take care it is hot

He holds out the note so she must tug it from his plump white
fingers Behind them the painting of VAN RUIJVEN and the GIRL

TANNEKE (VO)
She thought she was somebody all dressed up
like a lady

INT COOKING KITCHEN DAY

The kitchen is full of smoke and steam as TANNEKE cooks GRIET
assisting her

TANNEKE

Green as grass mind you Only worked there a

few months before Master van Ruijven brought her
over for the painting Got her into his wifes

finery poured wine down her like he was forcing
a goose took her home the long way Sure enough
she was carrying his by-blow before the paint

was dry

November 2003

She slams down the meat dish with a clang
TANNEKE (CONTD)

birth does he

PIETER laughs

PIETER

A nice greeting When I brought the meat order

He gestures to a laden handcart behind him GRIET hides her
hands under her apron

GRIET

Better carry it through
PIETER

Not even a smile for my pains
GRIET

Not today
PIETER

Come on

She shakes her head

PIETER (CONTD)
Ill put it in the book then owed by Griet -
one smile

GRIET smiles at last but at that moment PIETER straightens up
formally his open face clouds his hand automatically takes off
his cap GRIET turns and sees VERMEER watching from the dark
interior his grey eyes running past her to PIETER before he
disappears inside GRIET bites her lip

EXT HOUSE NIGHT

Lights blaze from the windows Torches are set high on the wall
to light the street GUESTS arrive the rustle of rich materials
and glitter of jewels Already the house is crowded a bright
thrum of voices over the MUSIC

VAN RUIJVEN and his entourage arrive by boat

EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT

A pig spit-roasts in the backyard a SMALL BOY sleepily turning
the handle

GRIET re-fills wine jugs from a barrel carries them into the
house

INT GREAT HALL NIGHT

The remains of a banquet are spread out on long trestle tables
in the Hall the fruit of TANNEKE’S labours - and of most of the
bakers pastry chefs and grocers of Delft GRIET serves wine

VERMEER sits at one end of the table VAN RUIJVEN at the other
with CATHARINA beside him

November 2003

She wears her green velvet dress fat pearls gleam at her neck
and ears her blonde hair is piled high and held in place by
beautiful tortoiseshell combs inlaid with mother-of-pearl She
is still big from the pregnancy but there is a lightness about
her now her eyes darting this way and that her laughter rising
over the other voices that makes it hard not to look at her

The bundle that is the new BABY is passed from GUEST to GUEST
along the table until he starts to yell in protest when he is
handed back with much laughter to his mother CATHARINA coos
over him gently soothing him with a finger but the WET-NURSE
is standing by Reluctantly she hands him over the baby latches
on greedily to the breast

VAN RUIJVEN
Lucky whelp Wheres mine

CATHARINA laughs bravely as he eyes her cleavage MARIA THINS
rises to her feet and taps a glass for quiet

MARIA THINS

Friends and neighbours our honoured guest
Master Van Ruijven Mistress Emilie Not only
are we gathered tonight to celebrate the safe
delivery into this world God be praised of
little Franciscus-

(Cheers and applause)
Our thanks to you all for so many kind presents -
but also to rejoice at another birth a new
masterpiece from the hand of my son-in-law
Johannes Vermeer

She pulls the cover from the finished painting which is on an
easel by the table More applause warm and genuine No doubt
that his talents are admired but VERMEER can only manage a tight
formal smile of acknowledgement VAN RUIJVEN gets to his feet
and bows taking the plaudits as his by right

He walks this way and that before the painting studying it with
a great air of connoisseurship until the room falls quiet His
wife EMILIE VAN RUIJVEN (the subject of the painting) MARIA
THINS and CATHARINA wait anxiously on his judgement Only
VERMEER sits still shielding his painting hand with the other

VAN RUIJVEN
Is this Indian yellow

Vermeer nods
VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
Extracted from the urine of sacred cows fed only
on mango leaves Youve glazed my wife in dried
piss eh

General laughter

November 2003

VERMEER
It is the right colour

CATHARINA flashes a look at her husband Play the game She
motions GRIET to pour more wine

CATHARINA
(Smiling) I cannot bear the suspense a moment
more Master Van Ruijven Pray tell us what you
think

VAN RUIJVEN takes a stance in front of the painting
authoritative proprietorial

VAN RULJVEN
I like it better when the sitter looks out from
a painting - takes one’s eye so to speak Hmm

His sharp eyes flick over the worried faces of VERMEER‘S
womenfolk He smiles graciously

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
Still it is good The colour and perspective
true the illusion perfect Such skill lavished
on my dear Emilie Why it is almost as if she
were thinking

VAN RUIJVEN laughs MARIA THINS leads more applause - of VAN
RUIJVENS approval and discerning taste - as VAN RUIJVEN places
a heavy purse on the table in front of CATHARINA EMILIE sits
passively her husband is cruelly accurate - as GRIET pours
wine for her

MARIA THINS
(Quickly)
And have you considered a subject for your next
commission We cannot expect you to give up
Emilie for so long again

VAN RUIJVEN
Considered - it’s already in hand Didnt I tell
you A coming fellow from Amsterdam

A palpable shock of disappointment from CATHARINA and MARIA
THINS VAN RUIJVEN chats on enjoying their discomfort

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
Trained with Rembrandt Van Rijn though who
hasnt these days A Merry Company by
Candlelight candlelight being his forte I have
business there at present so it suits me well
And he takes a deal more care of his sitters
than some painters I could name Fresh coffee
and cakes aplenty good company and no stinting
the wine flask

November 2003

MARIA THINS signals for GRIET to refill VAN RUIJVEN’S glass

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)

So what will you daub next Jan Have you found
inspiration up in that room of yours Is there
another patron in Delft with pockets as deep as
mine

An expectant silence But there is no other patron and VAN
RUIJVEN knows it The silence grows awkward

CATHARINA
For pity’s sake you tell him Master Van
Ruijven I swear I bring forth babies with less
moaning than he the notion for a painting

General laughter VAN RUIJVEN stops GRIET a hand on her arm and
grins down the table at VERMEER

VAN RUIJVEN
Heres what to paint

VERMEER smiles politely

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
Id keep her company of course offer my advice

VERMEER
Griet The wine

VAN RUIJVEN lets her go
VAN RUIJVEN
Look at her man How hard can it be to paint a
pretty girl
VERMEER glances at GRIET GRIET is in turmoil hating the
attention yet hoping in spite of herself that hell see
something in her But his eyes slide away

VERMEER
I have not found a subject

CATHARINA struggles to put on a brave face

CATHARINA
Are you in this new painting Emilie

EMILIE opens her mouth as if she might speak
VAN RUIJVEN

The company is not fit Besides she likes to
stay home

clacking the pieces on a tric-trac board MAERTGE is trying to
amuse the toddler JOHANNES with pat-a-cake games CATHARINA
paces to and fro failing to soothe the BABY

CATHARINA

The STUDIO is bare and cold Only one thing has changed A new
canvas sits blank on the easel

EXT VERMEER HOUSE DAY

GRIET carries her pitchers to the canal A few doors down the
street BAILIFFS are hauling furniture from a house A SERVANT
comes out after them holding her apron to her face TANNEKE has
come to see what’s going on

GRIET
What is it
TANNEKE
Bankrupt Three ships lost in a month they say

The shame

GRIET watches wide-eyed as more fine possessions are dragged out
and loaded onto a barge

An old GENTLEMAN and his white-haired WIFE come slowly out of
the house Stupefied by their misfortune The OLD WOMAN tries to
intervene to save some personal memento a BAILIFF pushes her
off roughly so she falls to the ground

TANNEKE crosses herself warding off evil
TANNEKE (CONTD)
God save us all Watch out for Young Mistress -

spiteful at this you mark my words

apprehensive silence The front door opens and shuts

At once CATHARINA’S VOICE rises in complaint a string of shrill
accusations

INT COOKING KITCHEN - NIGHT
Its late and the two servants sit by the fire

TANNEKE
One year it got so bad they had to sell some of
her jewels

TANNEKE rolls her eyes in delicious horror at the memory

TANNEKE (CONTD)
Phew You can imagine how that pleased her She
went off like a thunderclap crashing all over
the house - I kept my head down I can tell you
Smashed half the china off the dresser even
went to spoil one of his precious paintings
Well hes a temper on him too for all hes so
quiet Shes never set so much as a foot in the
studio from that day to this

GRIET listens open-mouthed
INT COOKING KITCHENCORRIDOR NIGHT

The household has gone to bed GRIET lingers by the dying embers

cracked fingers

A movement in the doorway She looks up and sees PIETER
EXT CHURCH DAY
The family and PIETER outside the church

GRIET
Father Mother This is Pieter our butcher’s
son The familys butcher

PIETER
Sir Mistress I am glad to meet you

He pauses politely but none of the family are able to take up
the conversation He smiles encouragingly

PIETER (CONTD)
Ive lived in Delft all my life and not seen the
half of it So I thought to visit every church
in the City and find the best

MOTHER
And how do you like ours

PIETER
Very well So well I may stop my search here -
if youll let me Mistress

He addresses himself entirely to GRIET’S MOTHER who is charmed
by his good looks and good manners

MOTHER
(Laughing) By all means Will you walk with us a
little Pieter
(They walk a few steps)
So a butcher Thats a good trade

PIETER
Griet is the hardest to please of all our
customers

MOTHER

Aye she gets that from me

GRIET is annoyed at the knowing smile that passes between her
MOTHER and PIETER FRANS elbows her

November 2003

MOTHER (CONTD)
(To FATHER)
There now I forgot We must speak with Willem
Jansson Griet you go on with Pieter here

She whisks her husband and son away leaving GRIET facing a
grinning PIETER

PIETER
Ah Griet Wheres that smile you owe me when
I’ve been so clever as to track you down

GRIET refuses to be impressed

GRIET
You had nothing better to do

The GOSSIPS are watching them a handsome young man is not going
to pass unnoticed GRIET takes the arm he offers holds her head
up as she walks away

EXT CANAL DAY

Walking by the canal There are other courting couples - for
that’s what they must be - prayer books under their arms going
home slowly PIETER skims a stone It bounces and bounces down
the flat water far beyond what seems possible PIETER laughs
turning back to GRIET arms wide

PIETER
My lucky day

GRIET’S arms are folded but she cannot resist answering his
smile with her own

INT STUDIO DAY

GRIET looks round the empty studio wanting to do something The
stretched canvas is as blank as before the room bleak She
pulls back the last shutter mottled cold light on the wall

INT MARIA THINS ROOM DAY

GRIET finds CATHARINA with her mother by the fire heads
together talking in low voices CATHARINA glares at GRIET
annoyed at the interruption

CATHARINA
What is it

GRIET
About the studio Mistress

CATHARINA
Yes

November 2003

CATHARINA rocks the baby’s cradle to show she is not being
idle

GRIET
Should I clean the windows

CATHARINA rolis her eyes

CATHARINA
You dont need to ask me such stuff

GRIET
Only it may change the light

CATHARINA pauses considering this MARIA THINS smiles wryly
CATHARINA notices

CATHARINA
(Sharply) Of course wash them

INT STUDIO DAY

Hard at work GRIET wrings out her cloth in a basin of water and
wipes the windows There are patterns of coloured glass the
light stains her fingers as she works pale blue rose pink The
same look of absorbed pleasure as when she cut the vegetables

She is startled when she turns to rinse the rag and sees VERMEER
standing stock still in the doorway

GRIET
Im sorry sir I-

VERMEER
Stay as you were

GRIET stands still the rag in her hands That small impatient
gesture of his hand

VERMEER (CONTD)
Just now At the window

Awkwardly GRIET tries to go back to wiping the window He points
at the rag

VERMEER (CONTD)
Drop it

She lets it fall Dirty water splatters on the clean floor
After a moment she pushes the rag under her skirt with one foot
Looks at her left hand again A sudden laugh of delight from
VERMEER

VERMEER (CONTD)
You can go

November 2003

EXT COURTYARD DAY

GRIET takes down laundry frozen stiff into scarecrow shapes
From inside the thin keening of the BABY stops for a moment
GRIET breathes in relief vapour curling from her lips The BABY
starts again GRIET tenses CATHARINA calls her

INT GREAT HALL DAY

It is gloomy in the big room even with candles lit A small fire
burns in the wide grate The BABY grizzles fretfully refusing
to feed from the WET-NURSE

CATHARINA is at her desk but she looks exhausted nerves frayed
She frowns at GRIET as if she can’t remember why she is here

GRIET
You called me

Something in the appearance of the maid her scrupulous
neatness her starched white cap her blatant youth is deeply
galling to CATHARINA

CATHARINA
The child needs a draught (To herself) My
mother will not be content till one of them dies
from her meanness (To GRIET) You will go to the
apothecary

An errand CATHARINA always reserves for herself

GRIET
Me Madam

CATHARINA
I suppose I should do everything But I have to
stay with the baby and besides its cold and I
believe I am falling sick too (Impatiently) I
will write what to ask for

CATHARINA pushes aside loose papers to make space Some fall to
the ground and GRIET hurries to pick them up Columns of
figures accounts bills CATHARINA snatches them back

CATHARINA (CONTD)
Can you read

GRIET hesitates her head dipping under the cap

GRIET
I can follow my prayer book

CATHARINA smiles Starts to write a big bold hand dipping the
quill fast and splashing drops of black ink across the paper
She sands and folds the paper with a flourish

November 2003

CATHARINA
Coltsfoot elixir hyssop and elderflower Enough
for both boys You will need
She looks through the desk for money Finds only a few coins
CATHARINA (CONTD)
(agitated)
No no thats not it To go on the Masters
account
She hands the note to GRIET flushed with indignation
INT WASHING KITCHEN DAY
Anywhere away from a fireside is bitterly cold GRIET shivers as
she puts on her wooden pattens wraps her rough woollen shawl
tighter round her shoulders The room darkens

VERMEER
Griet

She spins round VERMEER has followed her in to the narrow
Space He puts a hand out as one might to calm a frightened
animal then lets it fall

GRIET
Sir

VERMEER
It’s very cold

She waits tense at the sudden strangeness

VERMEER (CONTD)
Will you get something for me too

VERMEER hands her a scrap of paper

VERMEER (CONTD)
Some colours He knows

GRIET
On your account sir

VERMEER is taken aback for a moment

VERMEER
Yes My wife need not know

The exchange feels conspiratorial guilty reinforced by the
dark and narrow space He touches the edge of her shawl

VERMEER (CONTD)
(Vaguely) This is too thin I have a cloak-

November 2003

CORNELIA (0S)
Can I come

VERMEER shakes his head coming out of the moment He turns
abruptly and pushes past CORNELIA who is peering inquisitively
GRIET tucks the paper into her shawl quickly but not fast
enough to avoid CORNELIA‘S sharp eyes

GRIET
No It’s too cold
CORNELIA
Whats that
GRIET bites her lip
GRIET

I have to get medicines for your brother You
don’t want to get sick too

But the evasion - the lie - hangs between them CORNELIA’S eyes
narrow cat-like accusing

CORNELIA
You better hurry We had a brother that died

EXT DELFT STREETS DAY

A single skater pushes a sled-barrow down the frozen canal
hunched against the biting wind GRIET hurries along deserted
streets

INT APOTHECARYS DAY

Three steps down into the gloom of the apothecary’s shop GRIET
shakes the snow off her shawl and looks around the first time
she has ever been in such a place

All around the walls glass bottles and jars are filled with dark
liquids or packed with dried herbs A desiccated lizard dangles
in mid-air The atmosphere is smoky from a grumbling peat fire

APOTHECARY
Well

GRIET is startled Peering into the corner by the fire she sees
a tiny old man as brown and wrinkled as one of his remedies He
is watching her curiously

GRIET
My Mistress Catharina Bolnes sent me The baby
is sick

She brings out the note and the old man scans it quickly and
starts getting down different jars and bottles weighing out
herbs in his scales

November 2003

APOTHECARY
You must be the new maid She spoke of you I
guessed you were pretty Is she expecting again
that she sent you This weather eh

GRIET watches his quick hands working crushing and mixing the
dried leaves

APOTHECARY (CONTD)
Cold cures where it dont kill

The APOTHECARY ties up the packages neatly

APOTHECARY (CONTD)
There My best regards to your Mistress And
Master Van der Meer

GRIET reaches into her shawl and pulls out his paper

GRIET
The Master

The APOTHECARY opens it and finds VERMEER’S instructions He
frowns at GRIET

APOTHECARY
He always gets this himself

GRIET meets his eyes blank to their prying

GRIET
The weather

APOTHECARY
Hm

With another suspicious look at her he climbs a ladder to a high
cupboard and unlocks it with a key chained to his belt Clearly
the pigments are the most precious things in his shop He takes
out dark glass jars sealed with wax stands them on the
counter

APOTHECARY (CONTD)
A years wages couldnt buy you these

GRIET stares at the mysterious raw materials of magic

APOTHECARY (CONTD)
(approving)
He wants the very best its all that matters to
him

EXT VERMEER HOUSE DAY
Bitter cold weather the wind whips snow flurries along the

frozen canals Even so one window is open up in the studio
November 2003

INT STUDIO DAY

At first we see only over the model‘s shoulder VERMEER
painting his face rapt with concentration Moving round the
camera reveals one of CATHARINA’S bodices blue striped with
yellow then GRIET’S white cap But the model is not GRIET

Another GIRL pale and thin stands in the same pose encased
asexually in CATHARINA’S clothes

INT ENTRANCE HALL EVENING

GRIET is mopping the floor on hands and knees when MARIA THINS
black cane pins down her cloth GRIET looks up startled The
old woman studies her a thin smile

MARIA THINS
Hes started a new painting But you know that

GRIET
Yes Madam

MARIA THINS is watching her sharply

MARIA THINS
Theres no buyer he wont even let me see it
But hes working again It usually takes
longer

CORNELIA runs in through the front door dirty footprints on the
clean floor

CORNELIA
Grandmother Aleydis wont give me-

MARIA THINS cuffs her sharply
MARIA THINS
See what youve done silly child Now Griet
must do it over

CORNELIA scowls at GRIET MARIA THINS softens

MARIA THINS (CONTD)
There poppet get along and dont sulk

INT CELLAR NIGHT

Going to bed GRIET sees that her things have been disturbed Her
tile has been deliberately broken in half she and Frans split
either side of the jagged edge She is very upset

November 2003

INT MARIA THINS ROOM DAY

While the other girls bend diligently over their cushions and
bobbins CORNELIA teases a kitten with the dangling threads of
her lace work GRIET with a pile of mending before her tries
to concentrate The kitten’s claws snag in the delicate threads
CORNELIA laughs

GRIET
Youll spoil it

CORNELIA
I dont care

She gets up letting the cushion fall on the floor pins and
bobbins scattering

GRIET
Pick it up

CORNELIA
No

The other CHILDREN are watching round-eyed Gentle MAERTGE tries
to make peace

MAERTGE
(Pleading) Cornelia

CORNELIA sneers at GRIET

CORNELIA
You don’t tell me what to do You’re only a
servant

GRIET gets up angrily and CORNELIA scared and excited hides
behind the furniture

CORNELIA (CONTD)
Go away Leave me alone I didnt do anything

CATHARINA comes hurrying in the BABY asleep in her arms
CORNELIA runs to her clings to her skirts as if for protection

CATHARINA
Whats the matter

There is no answer except CORNELIA’S plaintive snivels
CATHARINA pets her distractedly but the BABY has woken and
starts crying again CATHARINA glares at GRIET

CATHARINA (CONTD)
Whats wrong with you Be off about your work

November 2003

INT CORRIDORSTUDIO DAY

GRIET sees with relief that the STUDIO door is open She steps
inside and leans against it shutting out the hostile world the
noise and clatter of everyday life It is not till she is three
steps into the room that she realises VERMEER is there silent
and still on his painting stool

GRIET
Im sorry sir

He waves her into silence concentrated on his painting

VERMEER
Stay

GRIET waits awkwardly in the middle of the room

VERMEER (CONTD)
The lead-white needs re-filling from the
cupboard

GRIET opens the door revealing jars pouches and pots of
different pigments She takes one of the larger pots and
measures out white paste into the small dish on the table

VERMEER seems to pay no more attention to her She stands and
watches enthralled as he mixes and thins the paint on the
palette making marks with a sure hand

GRIET stares at the chilly MODEL standing uncomfortably at the
window trying to see what he sees She looks back at the table
and then seized by an inspiration she goes quietly to the
cupboard She looks through the jars until she sees the one she
wants

VERMEER comes over to the mixing table to re-fill his palette
with white He sees the other colour

VERMEER (CONTD)
I didn’t ask for blue

GRIET
Her skirt I thought-

VERMEER
(Cold outrage)
Put it away

He turns back to the easel She is left at the table holding the
little pot of blue

November 2003

EXT CANAL DAY

GRIET walks along a parapet at the end PIETER must jump her

PIETER

He moves closer she tries to push him away he laces his
fingers through hers She focuses on his hand dried blood caked
at the base of the nails He smiles at her starts to lift one
side of her cap

PIETER (CONTD)

She pulls the cap down he tugs it up again laughing

PIETER (CONTD)

Long Very long

He tries to pull off the cap again She beats at his arms in
deadly earnest

cap in silence

PIETER

GRIET

PIETER grins
PIETER

November 2003

GRIET shoots him a look of fury outraged at the truth and shame
of it

INT STUDIO DAY

GRIET cleans the picture setting buffing the silver jug her
reflection distorted in the gleaming metal She compares the
setting to the painting Areas are blocked in dark colours the
jug and bowl are red-brown the girl’s skirt is black Dull
dead colours

VERMEER
Griet

VERMEER is behind her his dark reflection overwhelming hers in
the jug He cant apologise turns instinctively to the painting
for support

VERMEER (CONTD)
Were you looking at it

GRIET nods

VERMEER (CONTD)
Well

GRIET hesitates then blurts out her confusion

GRIET
I don’t understand Nothing is the right colour

VERMEER
Like the blue skirt This is the base colour it
gives the tone the shadow and light When its
dry I glaze over with blue but thinly so the
black shows through

VERMEER walks to the window and opens it wide

VERMEER (CONTD)
Look Griet Look at the clouds

She steps to the window he moves aside but still close enough
to feel the warmth of his body She stares intently at the puffy
clouds and blue sky

VERMEER (CONTD)
What colour are they

She frowns it must be some kind of trick Wants to speak but
dare not That impatient gesture

GRIET
White

November 2003

She knows it was the wrong thing to say and can see he is about
to dismiss her

GRIET (CONTD)
No not white There are colours in the clouds
Blue yellow grey
He smiles

VERMEER
Yes Now you understand

She doesnt but she doesn’t want to admit it She steals a
glance at him his sombre face aglow

VERMEER (CONTD)
Forget how the world is meant to be Only look
beneath In the shadows
Words frustrate him

VERMEER (CONTD)
(A command) Look Griet

INT COOKING KITCHEN DAY

GRIET stares out of the high kitchen window at scudding clouds
a pewter jug forgotten in her hands

TANNEKE
Thinking about your butcher boy

She laughs not unkindly as GRIET blushes and goes back to
polishing the jug

EXT DELFT STREETSAPOTHECARYS SHOP - DAY

GRIET slips away from the Market stalls down the alley to the
Apothecarys shop

INT STAIRS DAY
GRIET creeps up the stairs and slides through the studio door
INT STUDIO DAY

VERMEER is sitting massaging his painting hand as he stares at
the painting no brush or palette to be seen

GRIET
(at length)
Sir

She holds out the little packages from the apothecary He looks
back at the drab reds and browns of his painting already seeing
what will be there

November 2003

VERMEER
Did you get the lapis

GRIET finds a small lump of blackish stone (lapis lazuli)

VERMEER (CONTD)
For the skirt (An afterthought) You can mix the
colours

GRIET is excited but also fearful

GRIET
Mix the colours

He is already pulling open his painting cupboard taking out
scallop shells a wide copper bowl

GRIET (CONTD)
Sir I havent time All the chores-

VERMEER
Make time

GRIET
In here sir With you

VERMEER makes his impatient gesture then realises what she is
saying

VERMEER
No no Upstairs Come

In a corner of the studio is a wooden ladder leading up VERMEER
climbs up swiftly leaving GRIET alone Hesitating a moment she
picks up the bowl and dishes and clambers after him

INT ATTIC DAY

A bare bright room The only furniture is a heavy table with a
stone top dipped in the centre and a cupboard with many small
drawers

VERMEER lays out the pigments with deft delicate fingers Dark
powders and unpromising lumps of ore

VERMEER
Cochinealcinnabarindigoburnt umber Lapis
lazuli

He hangs over them with the helpless love of the obsessive
GRIET watches in fascination

He fishes narrow strips “buckles” - of lead from a jar of
brown liquid They are furred with white powder which he scrapes
into a dish

November 2003

VERMEER (CONTD)
Lead-white

A dark mash of grape skins and pips is spooned into the copper
bowl

VERMEER (CONTD)
This will make verdigris

From one of the packages he takes little black sticks

VERMEER (CONTD)
Bone black You grind it with the muller like
this

He takes a smooth egg-shape stone from the table puts a piece
of charred bone into the dip and quickly grinds it to a fine
powder Deftly he spoons it into a shell

VERMEER (CONTD)
Now you try

He puts another piece of bone in the hollow GRIET picks up the
muller and tries to do as he did She finds it awkward the
stone slips in her hand the bone flakes out of the hollow
VERMEER watches her intently

VERMEER (CONTD)
Twist from the shoulder

He puts his hand over hers

At the shock of his touch she freezes her breath and his loud
in the silence His white hand on hers outlined against the
black powder The seconds stretch She recoils abruptly and the
muller skids from her grasp across the table

INT COOKING KITCHENCORRIDOR NIGHT

GRIET sneaks through the house in the blue-grey before dawn
Through the room where TANNEKE and the WET NURSE are snoring
The BABY starts to cry and the WET NURSE stumbles out of bed to
the HALL TANNEKE moans at her GRIET shrinks into the shadows
as the disturbance spreads among the sleepers all around her

INT STAIRS -NIGHT

She climbs the stairs Stops outside the studio door and feels
above the frame for a hidden key

INT ATTIC DAWN

GRIET grinds and refines colours sieving the ground dust
through a muslin absorbed in her work

November 2003

INT GREAT HALL NIGHT

GRIET helps TANNEKE fold sheets into the linen cupboard TANNEKE
yawns theatrically

TANNEKE
Lord I’m that tired I can barely stand

CATHARINA is preparing to go out she is in high spirits Her
jewel box is open and she wears a wide white linen collar to
protect her rich yellow mantle from her face powder The girls
are hanging around her CORNELIA trying on her necklaces

CATHARINA
Be careful pigeon
TANNEKE
How much longer is the wet nurse to be with us

Mistress
CATHARINA doesn’t look round from the mirror

CATHARINA
I dont know A month or so Cornelia no Not
my pearls

CORNELIA puts back a heavy pearl necklace takes an inlaid
tortoiseshell comb from the jewel box MAERTGE smoothes her
mother’s elaborately dressed hair helping to pat the curls into
place round her forehead

TANNEKE sighs again

TANNEKE
A month Or more

CATHARINA dangles a bright chain over the BABY’S crib fondly
laughing as his fat fingers grab for it

CATHARINA
Ah ah greedy (To TANNEKE) Franciscus is
taking his rusk now but he still needs milk
Why What is it to you

TANNEKE
Oh nothing She’s eating us out of house and
home for a start

CATHARINA
She must eat well - for the baby

TANNEKE
All Im saying is I cant cook twice as much
and have no sleep at all It’s more than a body
can stand to be woken all hours by her coming
and going
November 2003

CATHARINA holds up her pearl earrings and approves herself with
a smile

CATHARINA
Tell her to be quiet then

TANNEKE
If I could move back to the cellar

CATHARINA
Well you cant Griet has your place

GRIET continues to fold linen quietly hearing the unreasonable
tone in CATHARINA’S voice at her name

VERMEER kneels on the black and white tiles playing stones with
little JOHANNES Now he looks up

VERMEER
Why not move Tanneke back

The WOMEN all look at him in astonishment He is not one for
domestic detail He throws the stones again seeming
unconcerned

VERMEER (CONTD)
Put a mattress in the attic for Griet Tanneke
can sleep soundly and Griet may clean the studio
before she comes down in the morning

CATHARINA GRIET and TANNEKE take in the implications of this
warily He smiles wide-eyed like Cornelia bent on mischief

VERMEER (CONTD)
Well

Catharina plays for time takes her necklace back from CORNELIA
to put in her jewel box

CATHARINA
My jewels You always have my jewels up there to
paint She
VERMEER comes to her offering a key like a love token

VERMEER
You lock up at night open it in the morning

He puts the key in her hand CATHARINA weighs it up She wants
this key this control but She glances over at GRIET
surreptitiously GRIET is frozen waiting for her fate to be
decided

CATHARINA adds the key to the bunch at her waist

November 2003

CATHARINA
There Are you satisfied Tanneke

TANNEKE throws GRIET a sour look feeling the girl has somehow
come out better than her

TANNEKE
(Sulkily) Yes Mistress

VERMEER touches CATHARINA’S linen collar

VERMEER
What is this Youve never worn it before

CATHARINA
(Laughing) Only every time I go out It catches
the powder

VERMEER
Hmm

He is looking at her with his painter’s eye runs a hand over
her cheek and jaw watching the shadows

VERMEER (CONTD)
Thats good May I have it

Tugging at the bow already His fingers caress her neck
CATHARINA pushes him away cheerfully

CATHARINA
No Jan We shall be late Again

INT ATTIC DAY

GRIET wakes early The sun is streaming through the attic
skylight church bells ringing over the town A wonderful sense
of freedom after the dark cellar

She lays out her few precious things on a beam puts her prayer
book by the trapdoor

She strains a pigment left to soak overnight takes off her
“painting” apron before climbing down to the studio

INT STUDIO DAY

The room is spotlessly clean and tidy GRIET inspects the
painting

The girl’s clothes and the objects all have their true colours

now the blue skirt shadowed with black red just visible under
the multiplicity of reflected colours in the bowl

November 2003

The girl in the painting wears not only GRIET’S cap cowling her
face but the wide white collar CATHARINA wore to powder
herself The effect is nun-like a physical and spiritual
separation from the body A chair fills the foreground adding
depth to the composition

GRIET frowns Something is not right She blocks different parts
with her hands

INT STAIRS DAY

CATHARINA unlocks the door the great bunch of keys jangling and
knocking her hand GRIET is waiting inside eyes down CATHARINA
stands aside for her to leave the girl goes by her without
looking up a murmur of acknowledgement

CATHARINA looks into the empty studio craning her neck to see
something significant in the bare room

INT ATTIC DAY

GRIET is grinding pigment her action now as smooth and easy as
VERMEERS a quiet trance-like state Interrupted by MEN’S
VOICES

MAN (0S)
You might get your own and save my back

GRIET freezes They are coming into the STUDIO Below her noises
of moving furniture a grunt as the MEN lift something heavy

VERMEER (0S)
Maria Thins suspects it a distraction

MAN (0S)
From painting How could a painter ignore such
an invent-

VERMEER (0S)
From finishing

They laugh GRIET peers down into the STUDIO
GRIETS POV

VERMEER holds one end of the camera obscura the MAN (VAN
LEEUWENHOEK) the other An extension obviously home-made has
been put on one end and they are struggling to fit the whole
contraption safely on the table

INT STUDIO DAY

VAN LEEUWENHOEK talks at top speed ideas bursting out without
time to catch his breath

November 2003

VAN LEEUWENHOEK
Did I tell you I ground a perfect lens last
week The very smallest distortion at one edge
Careful - I was awake a great part of the night
at this the new lens is not so well-secured as
I wanted

They lift the box but as they do so VAN LEEUWENHOEK catches
sight of GRIET watching from the attic He gasps and drops his
end of the camera obscura with a crash

VAN LEEUWENHOEK (CONTD)
Aah Theres a girl in your attic

VERMEER
The lens is off

GRIET hides

VAN LEEUWENHOEK
Confound it the whole thing is out of true
Whats she doing up there

He starts disassembling the camera obscura as he talks

VERMEER
Can you set it right

VAN LEEUWENHOEK
Hmm I dont know You see the
bracketnono I believe it is only a little
bentif I Hold that steady yes there it
goes I know who she is Catharina complained
at length - a brace of customers waiting - at
the strain of running so large a household I
thought she was bragging

VERMEER
Come down Griet
(to VAN LEEUWENHOEK )
If you kept your shop in better order you
wouldnt have to listen to so much talk

VAN LEEUWENHOEK
Its the talk fills my shop - and with sickness
in the town thats no small matter I am not the
only draper in Delft selling fine silk in five
weights but I am the only one willing and able
to converse on any subject under Gods sun

VERMEER (CONTD)

(drily)
Hold forth

November 2003

VAN LEEUWENHOEK
So Griet now we are on the level - Antony Van
Leeuwenhoek your servant - What were you doing
in the attic Spying for Mother Thins

GRIET hesitates this is her secret with VERMEER But something
in VAN LEEUWENHOEK’S face gives her confidence

GRIET
Grinding pigments sir

VAN LEEUWENHOEK
Griet the Assistant eh What next Have you
taken a pupil at last You wont teach me
VERMEER

You have no aptitude She can stand in if its
working Over there

Uncertainly GRIET takes up the pose of the model at the window

The two MEN burrow under VERMEER’S cloak to see the image They
look more than a little absurd a sort of lumpy pantomime horse

VAN LEEUWENHOEK
A little more stop the other way More more
there Dyou see the diffraction- ow my foot

GRIETS lips curl upwards

VERMEER
Stop that Griet

GRIET tries to look solemn
VERMEER (CONTD)

(Sharply) Don’t think Youre spoiling the
picture

GRIET struggles to obey VAN LEEUWENHOEK emerges from under the
cloak laughing

VAN LEEUWENHOEK
Youre a tyrant Tell her next she may not
breathe your blessed picture doesnt (Looking
at the painting) What does it mean Who is she
GRIET holds her breath VERMEER straightens up turns away

VERMEER (CONTD)
No one A vision I had

They move away leaving GRIET in the painting corner

November 2003

VAN LEEUWENHOEK
Why isnt Van Ruijven buying it His pockets are
deep enough surely even if he never pays a bill
till the next quarter but one Did you quarrel

VERMEER
He chooses a painter who offers wine and
company

VAN LEEUWENHOEK
Are you being stiff—-necked Jan Hes visited by
every notable in the country - still waiting for
my invitation - and your pictures are the pride
of his collection

VERMEER
He has good taste

VAN LEEUWENHOEK laughs

VAN LEEUWENHOEK
It isnt modesty holds you back Make it up with
him for Gods sake

VERMEER
Its not that he tells me what to paint and how
I know to sup with the Devil I must take a long
spoon No its why he wants them

VAN LEEUWENHOEK lowers his voice

VAN LEEUWENHOEK
That business with the maid Youre only a
painter Jan not his confessor

VERMEER
You know he offered to lend me more money

VAN LEEUWENHOEK
Well if you need some maybe I could-

VERMEER

Its not the money He’s greedy The paintings
arent enough He would be my Master

November 2003

VAN LEEUWENHOEK
Hes used to having his way and you cross him
thats-

The door opens abruptly and MARIA THINS stands there

MARIA THINS
Its true then You are here

VAN LEEUWENHOEK
Mistress Thins You look well I have the black
satin-

MARIA THINS ignores him turns angrily on her son-in-law

MARIA THINS
You told me you were painting today

VERMEER cradles his painting hand

VERMEER
I am I was

She is too annoyed to be able to speak to him switches back to
VAN LEEUWENHOEK

MARIA THINS
Anthony its time you were on your way and pray
God you never have the burden of a family to
interrupt your interesting notions

VAN LEEUWENHOEK bows to her

VAN LEEUWENHOEK
Your servant Mistress Good Day Jan Griet

MARIA THINS looks thunderstruck as she realises GRIET still in
the painting pose has witnessed this scene

MARIA THINS
What the Devil is she- Downstairs girl At
once

GRIET hurries to leave MARIA THINS turns to VERMEER again
MARIA THINS (CONTD)
(Hissing)

Joannis in the Name of Christ - think You are

not the only one in this house with eyes
EXT COURTYARD - EVENING
It is the end of the day TANNEKE sits on a bench trying to
light a pipe GRIET takes down the last of the laundry CORNELIA
and MAERTGE are practising dance steps

November 2003

ae eee

TANNEKE
No need for the Fish Market tomorrow Mistress
wants eggs

She puffs at the pipe drawing out the moment Looks over at the
two girls

TANNEKE (CONTD)
(lowered voice)
No she cannot abide the smell when she’s with
child
GRIET arms full of baby clothes can’t hide her surprise

GRIET
So soon

TANNEKE is delighted to be first with bad news
TANNEKE
As if there werent enough mouths to feed
already But what can you do

She looks up to the lit studio window significantly

TANNEKE (CONTD)
Men

GRIET doesn’t want to hear this

GRIET
Did you never want children Tanneke Your own
family

TANNEKE

Dunno Maybe I will one day
Again GRIET is taken aback TANNEKE laughs

TANNEKE (CONTD)
How old did you think I was then

Wisely GRIET doesnt attempt to guess If she did she might say
forty

TANNEKE (CONTD)
Started with Old Mistress when I was fourteen
(Counting on her fingers) Year before Maertge
was born What‘s that then

CORNELIA
(Promptly she must have been
listening all along)
Twenty eight

November 2003

TANNEKE
Twenty eight There you are

GRIET is horrified but TANNEKE examines her beefy forearms and
broad girth with some satisfaction

TANNEKE (CONTD)
It‘s the work does it Few more years you’1ll
thicken up
INT COOKING KITCHENGREAT HALL NIGHT

GRIET must pass through the Great Hall to get to bed but dare
not interrupt the scene before her

CATHARINA sits at the delicate keyboard of a spinet all her

fretful energy released in the music her hands floating over
the notes

VERMEER leans forward to turn the page for her inhaling her
scent His hand caresses her bare shoulder A deeply sensual
intimate moment

GRIET sinks back in the shadows

EXT CANALSIDE - EVENING

GRIET playfully runs away from PIETER He catches her and kisses
her

INT STUDIO DAY
GRIET lays out colours for the day with absolute certainty and
precision glancing at the painting to be sure of what is

needed

She stops short circles the easel looking from different
angles

Very carefully and deliberately she drags the heavy lion-headed
chair out of the foreground of the setting

She looks at what shes done astonished by her own boldness
The key turns in the lock she hurries to the door breathless
Instead of CATHARINA CORNELIA is at the door holding the heavy
bunch of keys with pride She eyes GRIET intently taking
advantage of her surprise

CORNELIA

(Accusing)
What were you doing

November 2003

GRIET is wrong-footed tries to keep calm

GRIET
Wheres your mother

CORNELIA is peering into the studio over GRIETS shoulder

CORNELIA
She has a headache Youre to mind the little
ones this morning

EXT HOUSE DAY

GRIET sits on the bench in the sunshine with baby FRANCISCUS on
her knee LISBETH and ALEYDIS are playing with their dolls
CORNELIA interfering in their game MAERTGE is sewing

VERMEER comes down the street CORNELIA and LISBETH run to meet
him He goes into the house without looking at GRIET She waits
tense

INT HOUSE NIGHT

GRIET carries her candle through the darkened house and
upstairs She stands outside the studio door hardly daring to
go in

INT STUDIO NIGHT

The room is neat and empty No sign of work the window closed
the cupboard locked GRIET holds up her candle to see the
painting He has made her change painted out the chair GRIET
stares exultant at what she has done

INT ATTIC DAY

GRIET and VERMEER are at work preparing colours GRIET grinding
bone black VERMEER kneading a paste of precious blue lapis
lazuli VERMEER clears his throat

VERMEER
Why did you move the chair

GRIET pauses not uncertain but wanting to say rightly what she
means

GRIET

When you took the map from the painting of
Mistress Van Ruijven - it was better

November 2003

She puts down the muller thinking it through carefully

GRIET (CONTD)
The clear space below her arm it balances the
wall above now She is not trapped

She has finished and looks up at him for his reaction but he
stands still and silent for a long time At last he starts
working again GRIET picks up her muller too Almost at once he
stops

VERMEER
So I never thought to learn from a maid

They are both very still their hands next to each other by the
bright pigments His beautiful long white fingers so close to
hers they can feel each other’s warmth

Then suddenly a clatter of footsteps and voices below MARIA
THIN’S voice a warning tone

MARIA THINS
Griet are you up there

INT STUDIO DAY

VERMEER climbs down the ladder MARIA THINS is at the door her
eyes flick anxiously up to the ATTIc

CATHARINA fumes behind her infuriated at her exclusion her
hair half-dressed

CATHARINA
One of my tortoiseshell combs is gone

It is an accusation not a statement

VERMEER stands at the window looking out GRIET reads disaster
in MARIA THINS’ scowl CATHARINAs eyes rest on a smear of
scarlet madder on GRIETs arm She draws herself up with fierce
dignity She is totally vindicated

CATHARINA (CONTD)
Perhaps now I will be listened to in my own
home Shes nothing but trouble

She sweeps her skirt round to go downstairs MARIA THINS close
behind her clever soothing words for once pass unheeded
CORNELIA’S face at the door a brief triumphant smirk before she
follows them Suddenly GRIET understands

GRIET and VERMEER are left alone in the studio A painful
silence punctuated by the WOMEN’S VOICES from below

VERMEER turns abruptly and crosses the room not meeting her
eyes As he reaches the door
November 2003

GRIET
Master I did not do it

He hesitates back turned

GRIET (CONTD)
(A whisper) Help me

On his face frozen in dismay
INT HOUSE DAY

The whole house in uproar CATHARINA furious CORNELIA crying
TANNEKE red-faced with indignation

VERMEER goes from room to room pulling back bed covers
sweeping stuff off shelves the WOMEN squawking behind him like
hens

He finds GRIET’S tortoiseshell comb under CORNELIA‘S mattress

VERMEER
Cornelia

INT MARIA THINS ROOM DAY

It is MARIA THINS who takes up her cane while CATHARINA turns
away weeping CORNELIA’S face is white and defiant her grey
eyes like stone

INT GREAT HALL DAY

VERMEER and MARIA THINS sit at the oak table while CATHARINA
paces to and fro kicking her skirts out of her way There is
something a little unhinged disturbing about her anger the
way it controls her body jerks her this way and that

GRIET and TANNEKE stand and face the family but CATHARINA acts
as if GRIET werent in the room

CATHARINA
She’s dishonest Always sneaking around skiving
her work

GRIET looks towards VERMEER hoping he will explain defend her
He is studying his boots MARIA THINS glares at her warningly

CATHARINA (CONTD)
Tanneke has complained of it Creeping upstairs
all day long

She bumps against the table in her anger thumps it with her
open hand VERMEER half-reaches out to her She stops abruptly
she might be going to hit him MARIA THINS decides to take
charge

November 2003

MARIA THINS
My daughter is right There has been too much
sneaking about

Her tone includes her son-in-law in the charge

CATHARINA
(A fresh outburst) I only took her out of
charity If I’d thought-

MARIA THINS cuts her off

MARIA THINS
With another child due we need the extra help

CATHARINA is quelled for the moment

MARIA THINS (CONTD)
Griet fit in all your duties and do not slack
or it will be the worse for you

Her eyes are dark and beady calculating holding them all in
her grasp

MARIA THINS (CONTD)
I shall invite Master Van Ruijven Joannis must
have a new commission And it will have to be a
big one several figures

VERMEER cradles his painting hand in the other protectively but
he neither speaks nor looks at any of them MARIA THINS claps
her hands dismissing them all

MARIA THINS (CONTD)
Now back to work

INT MARIA THINS ROOM DAY

CATHARINA is very nervous she brushes the GIRLS’ hair ignoring
their protests

GRIET helps MAERTGE into her first grown-up dress of which she
is shyly proud MAERTGE will never be a beauty but dressed up
her hair curled and ribboned she begins to look like a lady
only a couple of years younger than GRIET but already her life
set on an utterly different course

CATHARINA sees them together - the mousy richly-dressed girl
the linen-capped maid who effortlessly eclipses her — and her
Mouth tightens

CATHARINA
Maertge Come here

November 2003

Obediently MAERTGE goes to her MOTHER CATHARINA’S hands are
still busy taming CORNELIA’S hair she can think of nothing to
keep MAERTGE with her

CATHARINA (CONTD)
Dont gawk your head like that child It’s
ugly

MAERTGE droops instantly CORNELIA pokes her tongue out at her
sister winces as CATHARINA tugs at her hair

NOISE from outside the guests arriving They all run to look
out of the window

EXT VERMEER HOUSE DAY - THEIR POV

VAN RUIJVEN with his wife and daughter arrives at the house in
grand style on their barge Their clothes are even richer his
voice booms louder than before VERMEER stepping forward to
greet him looks shabby in comparison

INT GREAT HALL DAY

As the honoured guests VAN RUIJVEN sits at one end of the table
his WIFE EMILIE on VERMEERS right VAN RUIJVEN meets
CATHARINA’S eye with a lascivious grin

VAN RUIJVEN
I swear you get lovelier every time I see you
Catharina Do you paint yourself

He laughs again then licks a finger and rubs it on CATHARINA’S
cheek examines it for signs of make-up As an afterthought
licks it again as if he had dipped it in honey CATHARINA
smiles at him a woman of the world

CATHARINA
One painter in the house is enough Raising my
children is all my pride

VAN RUIJVEN
Ah little Maertge Filling out nicely isn’t
she

MAERTGE sitting between her MOTHER and FATHER quails at his
attention ears burning red

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)

All those girls eh Lads swarming round ‘em
like flies before long If I were a few years
younger

GRIET serves EMILIE VAN RUIJVEN as calm and silent as her
painting

MARIA THINS turns to VAN RUIJVEN with a smile

November 2003

MARIA THINS
A connoisseur in everything Master Van Ruijven
But you should be faithful to one mistress above
all others

VAN RUIJVEN is intrigued

MARIA THINS (CONTD)
Art Your name will surely be famed as one of
the great patrons the Maecenas of Delft With
your exquisite taste your subtle understanding
of allegory and allusion-

VAN RUIJVEN laughs head back

VAN RUIJVEN
Damn you could sell sour milk to cows woman
What do you want now

MARIA THINS straightens the delicate white lace on her cuff

MARIA THINS
A group painting A family portrait perhaps

She glances at VERMEER knowing he won’t like this He
concentrates on helping MAERTGE

MARIA THINS (CONTD)
Yourself and Emilie Your lovely daughter too

No sign of interest from VAN RUIJVEN MARIA THINS pushes
further

MARIA THINS (CONTD)
Or a Merry Company Wine and a good meal on the
table a still life with your friends all about
(A beat) Music and dancing

VAN RUIJVEN
Better better

GRIET serves MARIA THINS CATHARINA puts a hand on VAN RUIJVENS
arm

CATHARINA
It will have to be a Slow Measure if he paints
it

VAN RUIJVEN leans closer to her shamelessly ogling her
cleavage

VAN RUIJVEN
Thats the only dance I know

November 2003

They giggle together like smutty children GRIET goes round to
serve VAN RUIJVEN head down shoulders hunched trying to be
invisible

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
There’s truth in what you say Maria larded in
with all those sweet words It so happens your
son-in-law is a damn fine painter as good as
any Amsterdam fellow I’d say-

He breaks off to take a mouthful of meat

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
Ah that’s good Fat Tanneke learnt to cook at
last What I mean is I‘ll swallow your bait
the big picture several figures a Merry
Company But not a family portrait

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)

If I’m to put up with all those tedious hours of
sitting I need something to rest my eyes on I
want her in the painting

He reaches back with one arm and grabs GRIET pulling her
forward VERMEER is on his feet CATHARINA shrieks VAN RUIJVEN
releases his grip still smiling His sharp eyes are on VERMEER
as he sinks back into his chair the reaction noted

MARIA THINS licks her lips eyes darting from one end of the
table to the other VERMEER runs one fingertip round his
wineglass till it sings

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
A tavern scene why not That would make a
change for you Griet could serve me

GRIET glances at CATHARINA who is leaning forward cheeks
flushed eyes burning ready to explode in fury VAN RUIJVEN
stuffs another lump of meat in his mouth enjoying himself

VAN RULJVEN (CONTD)
So what do you say Can I have her

INT MEAT MARKET DAY

GRIET waits to be served A fly crawls slowly over the meat A
huddle of WOMEN nudge and stare GRIET looks away mortified
There is no sign of PIETER PAUL leans over to her

PAUL
There’s been talk of you

GRIET flushes her face tight
GRIET
I’ve done nothing to be talked of

November 2003

PAUL shrugs

PAUL
Van Ruijvens cook Says youre to be painted
with her master Youll have heard about him and
the maid that was painted before

Agitated GRIET stuffs the meat in the shopping pail

GRIET
You shouldnt believe gossip

PAUL laughs

PAUL
Oh I dont Not the half of it (A beat) I’11
tell Pieter you asked after him
EXT DELFT STREETS DAY

GRIET hurries back through the crowds the girls trotting to
keep up

PIETER
Griet Wait

PIETER hurries along the street after them He has a carcass on

one shoulder his apron is smeared with blood Passers-by look
round in surprise

PIETER arrives breathless Props the carcass on stiff hind
legs

PIETER (CONTD)
Did you hear what-

GRIET
I heard

He waits for her denial

PIETER
No smoke without fire they say

GRIET
Is that what you think

PIETER
No I Youre only a maid What can you do

GRIET bites her lip

GRIET
I must get back Tanneke

November 2003

She starts walking again the GIRLS beside her PIETER shoulders
the carcass and comes after them

PIETER
Griet Don’t walk away Listen to me

MAERTGE holds GRIET’S hand possessively CORNELIA glares at him
He comes closer lowers his voice to a murmur

PIETER (CONTD)
Remember who you are Griet Don’t get caught up
in his world

She turns on him angrily
GRIET
You listen to me Pieter the Butcher I am only
a maid but I will never give in to Master van
Ruijven

PIETER
I dont speak of van Ruijven

EXT VERMEER HOUSE - DAY

GRIET hurries back to the house Too late she sees VERMEER and
VAN RUIJVEN talking by the canal and turns away

VAN RUIJVEN
Hey you Girl Griet Come here

GRIET turns slowly VAN RUIJVEN comes up to meet her VERMEER
following reluctantly

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
Where were you today Griet I missed you

VAN RUIJVEN smiles sideways at VERMEER winks at GRIET
VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
We both did I tried to keep him amused but all
I got for my pains was my face to the wall
He leans close confiding
VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
I hear youve been of great use to your Master
pretty Griet All that grinding and stirring
eh

VAN RUIJVEN is delighted at the effect of his jibes on GRIET and
VERMEER

November 2003

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
Master and Maid - theres a tune we all know
And you can practise it together now we’ve made
our bargain eh Jan You won’t forget will you

VERMEER shakes his head stiffly like a puppet EMILIE VAN
RUIJVEN and a teenage DAUGHTER come up behind them

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
Good You’11l want to make a start on that before
we come again

VAN RUIJVEN tucks his wife’s arm into his GRIET looks up at her
MASTER His grey eyes slide past hers and away He is angry She
hurries into the house

INT STUDIO DAY

GRIET sweeps the studio orange peel and crumbs mark VAN
RUIJVENS place among the chairs and instruments The key turns
in the lock but it is not CATHARINA VERMEER stands in the
doorway as if he too were unable or unwilling to come into the
STUDIO

VERMEER
Griet

He gestures to the painting corner

Two tapestry-covered chairs have been arranged around the
harpsichord a lute on one a bass viol propped against the
wall VERMEER busies himself at the table GRIET looks at the
paintings on the wall both taken from downstairs

One is a landscape trees and an open road into the distance
The other is of a man and two women The man is buying the young
one’s favours from the old he already has an arm round her
The Procuress Dirk van Baburen

VERMEER clears his throat and GRIET looks round full of
foreboding waiting for her instructions But none come He
simply sits and stares at her And stares His face wears a
familiar abstracted expression Her eyes slowly fill with tears
He is going to paint her

She looks bleakly at the musical instruments lying around her

GRIET
What should I(pretend to play)

VERMEER frowns

VERMEER
No I have already begun the group painting You
are not to sit with Master Van Ruijven That
much is agreed
November 2003

The tears that threatened before now spill down her cheeks

GRIET
Thank you sir

VERMEER stands up abruptly profoundly ill at ease

VERMEER
I am to paint you alone

INT MARIA THINS ROOM DAY

MARIA THINS
My daughter must not hear of this ‘other’
painting

MARIA THINS counts out coins while GRIET waits with the shopping
pail

MARIA THINS (CONTD)
In her condition

GRIET looks down at the coins in her hands

GRIET
Maam What of Master van Ruijven

MARIA THINS fingers the handle of her cane

MARIA THINS
It is to hang in his private cabinet with a
curtain over

Gimlet eyes on GRIET to see how she takes this
She turns to go back up her private staircase

MARIA THINS (CONTD)
Hes no fool mind you And he wont be taken
for one so dont think otherwise Youre a fly
in his web(To herself) We all are Joannis
should have gone about it another way

EXT CANAL EVENING

GRIETS sombre face reflected for a moment before the pitcher
breaks the surface

EXT HOUSE EVENING

Carrying the pitcher in she meets VERMEER returning home his
cloak wrapped round him He holds the door open As she passes
he murmurs in her ear

VERMEER
Tomorrow morning
November 2003

She hesitates for a moment heart racing She can feel his eyes
on her the warmth of his body

GRIET
I cannot I have work

VERMEER
Find a way

He moves on into the house
INT STUDIO DAY

VERMEER
Look out of the window Down at the table Away

He frowns It isnt working

Surrounding GRIET are all the “props familiar from the
paintings - The silver bowl and jug the studded box powder
brush an open book CATHARINA’S yellow bodice hangs on a chair
GRIET is hedged in by things VERMEER pulls things away drags a
different table carpet into place pushes a chair across
frantically building walls between himself and her GRIET
watches

GRIET
(Bravely)
These are ladies’ things

VERMEER
You want me to paint you with a mop in your
hands

He is closing shutters slam slam The studio grows darker and
darker

GRIET
No sir
VERMEER
(Gentler) No I dont know (A beat) Perhaps

the costume What if
He reaches for the yellow mantle GRIET plucks up courage

GRIET
I cannot wear her clothes

VERMEER
(A beat) No

He looks at her across the table

November 2003

VERMEER (CONTD)
I am not to paint you as a maid Or a lady What
then

GRIET doesn’t answer VERMEER keeps looking Suddenly he starts
pulling everything away chair table bowls and boxes all
swept away Until there is nothing between them she stands
alone in the last patch of light

VERMEER (CONTD)
There I will paint you as I first saw you Not
a maid You

CLOSE ON VERMEER‘’S broad brush painting the first shadow in the
bottom corner bone black and burnt umber Powerful strokes
obliterating the pale ground

INT GREAT HALL EVENING

GRIET reaches up on tiptoe to get a dish white arm and neck at
full stretch CATHARINA sees her husband staring spellbound

CATHARINA
Jan My necklace

She holds up the ribbons of her necklace for him to tie Looks
at him in the mirror as he does so a seductive smile an oh-so-
casual adjustment of her bodice to reveal more of her

magnificent bosom Quite unaware he ties the ribbons and walks
out

VERMEER
Ill be in the studio till dinner

MARIA THINS watches from the fireplace puffing silently on her
pipe CATHARINA sees GRIET in the background of her reflection

CATHARINA
(Acid) Havent you finished yet

INT STUDIO DAY

VERMEER mixes lead-white with crimson lake pale and buttery-
soft under his palette knife His hand drizzling in more linseed
oil the paint grows richer and creamier

The brush poised to paint VERMEER looks over to GRIET by the
window looking out Clears his throat

VERMEER
Look at me Turn your head not your shoulders

She adjusts her position seated looking over her left
shoulder the light falling on her right cheek Face enclosed by
her cap her mouth shut She stares at the floor

November 2003

VERMEER (CONTD)
Look at me

Slowly she raises her eyes to meet his but cant hold his gaze
The brush still poised

VERMEER (CONTD)
Look at me

Her eyes waver and meet his again His brush blanks out the

downcast eyes in the painting He lets out a sigh almost a
shudder of pleasure

VERMEER’S face intent alight His whole being involved in the
act of painting nothing else in the world

The brush on the palette stroking the canvas Now that he has
it there is nothing tentative about his painting

The shadow of GRIETS eyebrow the intersection of curves across
and down VERMEERS eyes drinking in every detail

INT VERMEERS STUDIO - LATER
VERMEER is working on the cheek

VERMEER
The point of your cap Fold it back

GRIET pushes the long point back onto her shoulder revealing
her jaw and cheek She swallows feeling exposed Her lips are
pressed tight Her eyes waver and meet his again

VERMEER (CONTD)
I never sat so close before

GRIET
How long have I been here sir

He changes brushes continues to paint

VERMEER
It doesnt matter

GRIET strains to hold her twisted pose VERMEER is staring at
her again

VERMEER (CONTD)
Take off your cap

GRIET reaches up then stops her hand protective on the white
linen

GRIET
No sir I cannot

November 2003

VERMEER
Cannot

GRIET drops her head

In the painting behind her The young woman bare-headed leans
back in surrender while the client and Madam heads covered
press forward on her

GRIET
Will not

VERMEER
I need to see your face the cap covers too
much There’s some cloth in the storeroom

GRIET goes into the little storeroom There is no catch on the
door no need for one

INT STOREROOM DAY

There is a trunk of clothes in the corner props for use in the
paintings cloths to cover the table gentlemen’s sashes the
trimmings from CATHARINA’S rich velvet gown GRIET finds some
strips of cloth and lays them in front of her

She reaches up and unties her cap releases an unruly mane of
blonde hair

She lifts one of the cloths to wrap round her hair looks into
the mirror Sees a movement and turns to find him standing in
the doorway

Looking at her Not at GRIET the Maid but at her The real
secret GRIET Desire holding him transfixed in the doorway

She returns his gaze her hair tumbled round her face lips
parted bold liberated naked

The CHILDRENS VOICES from downstairs VERMEER backs away

INT GREAT HALL DAY

GRIET folds clothes into the tall wardrobe The stiff blue
bodice worn by the girl in the Pitcher painting The yellow
satin mantle trimmed with fur

CATHARINA sits by the fire with VAN RUIJVEN MAERTGE and
CORNELIA are working on an embroidery frame though CORNELIA is
far more interested in the conversation

VAN RUIJVEN

Emilie enjoys sitting God knows why If only
he’d let one do something else

November 2003

CATHARINA offers him the sewing on her lap He pretends a few
dainty stitches hands it back laughing

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
But you agree or youd be up there getting
painted all the time Why not with such a good-
looking wife

CATHARINA falters upset

CATHARINA
I have the household to run you know I can’t
be forever up and down

VAN RUIJVEN
There you are - Life goes on I mean God knows
I admire the paintings extravagantly - Christ
I pay enough for them - but I am flesh and
blood I must feed my grosser parts

CATHARINA glances at the girls wondering if she should send
them out They are bent studiously over their frame GRIET stays
dead still behind the wardrobe door

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
Not to deny I may be consoled in a painting for
what I cannot have in the flesh Hunger is the
best sauce eh

GRIET presses her face against the cool starched linen

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
If I had you against my private wall for
instance painted by your artful husband I
could take pleasure at will in your charms and
he none the wiser

CATHARINA laughs as best she can

CATHARINA
I never think painting so lively as when you
speak of it

VAN RUIJVEN takes a long draught of wine
VAN RUIJVEN
You know Ive a mind to go up and surprise him

sometime - in the act

CATHARINA
But you said yourself it’s very dull

VAN RUILJVEN
Oh not with Emilie When he’s alone with some
young beauty

November 2003

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
You must have noticed how he never bothers with
old women Only young and pretty ones On their
own

He helps himself to another glass of wine CATHARINA does her
best to ignore his meaning

CATHARINA
Youll have to wait then He makes only one
painting at a time though my mother has often
pressed him otherwise

VAN RUIJVEN
(Smug) Indeed

GRIET listens in terror

CATHARINA
He claims he cannot hold two in his head though
when I consider all I must manage with the house
and children

VAN RUIJVEN secretly gives CORNELIA a sip of wine She screws
her face up in disgust

CORNELIA
I like it

VAN RUIJVEN gives her a squeeze

VAN RUIJVEN
That’s my girl

They giggle and whisper together both looking over at GRIET
CATHARINA looks up and catches CORNELIA taking another sip She
is shocked though she tries to laugh it off

CATHARINA
Master Van Ruijven what are you doing

INT STUDIO DAY

VAN LEEUWENHOEK gazes quizzically at GRIET’S strange turban-like
head gear

VAN LEEUWENHOEK
What is she meant to be

VERMEER
It is Griet’s invention Ask her

VAN LEEUWENHOEK is struck by the casual intimacy of this GRIET
is trembling with the strain of holding her twisted pose
VERMEER scowls at the painting

VAN LEEUWENHOEK
Whatever it is it becomes you Griet
November 2003

VAN LEEUWENHOEK wants to break the tension that thickens around
the two of them

VAN LEEUWENHOEK (CONTD)
Jan did I tell you of the meeting tomorrow
Optics and lenses You should speak on painting

VERMEER
I have nothing to say

VAN LEEUWENHOEK
The camera obscura then You know more about
light than anyone

VERMEER
I know Every painting I start again at the
beginning Ill never know

VERMEER stabs a brush angrily towards a canvas propped on the
table - the Concert painting

VERMEER (CONTD)
Theres what happens when one pays heed to
theory A one-point perspective of nothing

A myriad of chalk lines going this way and that Small blocks of
colour dotted disjointedly over the canvas

VAN LEEUWENHOEK
Its promising Do you have the small lens I
want to show it at the meeting

VERMEER
Ill fetch it

VERMEER goes out VAN LEEUWENHOEK turns back to GRIET

VAN LEEUWENHOEK
Rest a minute why don’t you

Gratefully GRIET moves VAN LEEUWENHOEK looks at her painting
He is startled by what he sees We like GRIET do not see the
painting His eyes flick from her to the painting and back

VAN LEEUWENHOEK (CONTD)
What is this Not his usual manner Not at all
(A beat) Its for Master Van Ruijven is that
so Mistress Thins will be pleased

He hesitates needing to warn her wanting to be fair
VAN LEEUWENHOEK (CONTD)
Hmm You do see his interest in you is partly
because Master Van Ruijven How should I put
this

November 2003

GRIET frowns He examines the painting again

VAN LEEUWENHOEK (CONTD)
He sees things as he wants them to be perfected
by him Everything serves the painting
everything He doesnt think of the
consequences You must

He looks at GRIET his eyes kindly concerned
VAN LEEUWENHOEK (CONTD)
Theres no bridge across this water You

understand me Griet

GRIET dips her head but the head dress doesn’t hide her face
She looks up again

GRIET
I do not think he would hurt me Sir

VAN LEEUWENHOEK
(Gently) How much do you know of men

INT COOKING KITCHEN DAY

GRIET chops vegetables A moment of reflection before she sweeps
the pattern into the pot

INT STUDIO DAY

GRIET utterly still in her pose almost as if she were the
painting There is now a black drape behind her

VERMEER sits at the easel dissatisfied Tries one brush after
another stands and stares at her goes back to the painting

VERMEER
Open your mouth

GRIET
Sir

VERMEER

Open your mouth

GRIET is horrified But what can she do She licks her lips and
opens them

VERMEER (CONTD)
Lick your lips Again

INT GREAT HALL NIGHT

GRIET brings in a wine jug and glasses Only MARIA THINS looks
up sharp-eyed

November 2003

VERMEER is going through CATHARINA’S jewel box searching for
something CATHARINA moves slowly easing herself off the bed
already heavy with the new baby

CATHARINA
Jan please

He brings over the box settles on a low stool and massages her
feet between his hands

CATHARINA is dressed in her fine velvet She stifles a yawn

CATHARINA (CONTD)
I am so tired

GRIET pours their wine sets it in front of them

VERMEER
Wear these

He holds out her big pearl earrings glossy white drops nesting
in his hand CATHARINA smiles delighted by this attention

VERMEER (CONTD)
I must be there The City Fathers have asked
There might be a commission (Seeing the
earrings) Ah good Look Griet

CATHARINA swings round

VERMEER (CONTD)
That point of light in the shadow of the neck
leading the eye

CATHARINA
Jan

GRIETS eyes meet VERMEER’S She sees that he has found what he
needs That he is pitiless MARIA THINS sees it too

INT STUDIO DAY
VERMEER is arranging the setting of The Concert The Concert
painting half-covered has progressed considerably GRIET

hurries in

GRIET
Sir Do not ask this of me

He knows exactly what she’s talking about

VERMEER
It is needed

GRIET
My ears are not pierced

November 2003

He laughs at such a mundane excuse But GRIET isn’t laughing
she is angry

GRIET (CONTD)
Ive done everything you wanted

VERMEER
The composition - its not balanced
GRIE
(Stubbornly)
Sometimes you paint without a model
VERMEER
You want me to imagine how the earring would
look
She wont give in
GRIET

She will find out
Nor will he

VERMEER
This has to be Griet See for yourself

He insists that she look as he uncovers her painting GRIET
covers her mouth in horror WE SEE only her reaction

GRIET
(A whisper)
Oh You looked inside me
EXT DELFT STREETS DUSK

GRIET hurries along her shawl pulled tight round her shoulders
head down

INT APOTHECARY’S DUSK
The APOTHECARY smiles when he sees it is her
APOTHECARY
Well then What will it be today I set aside

some lapis-

GRIET
It’s- it’s for me

The APOTHECARYS expression changes He is sharp-eyed he can

see trouble in her face His quick fingers continue to shred
dried leaves into a leather apron

November 2003

APOTHECARY
Oh it’s that way is it (Reluctant) I have a
draught if you want to bring it off

There is more disappointment in his eyes than disapproval GRIET
takes his meaning

GRIET
Oh no No I need something to numb the skin I
have money

She pulls coins from her pocket The OLD MAN scans her face
again goes off grumbling knowing something’s wrong

GRIET goes to pull her cap forward her finger tip touches her
ear and stops there

INT ATTIC NIGHT

GRIET looks at the tiny vial of oil tips some onto a
handkerchief and rubs it onto her earlobe

She heats a needle in the candle flame

Clutching the needle in trembling fingers she stares into the
mirror from downstairs Her frightened face reflected in the
candlelight

FOOTSTEPS on the stairs Into the STUDIO below GRIET hides the
needle and vial MARIA THINS comes up through the trap door
breathing hard She gives GRIET a long searching look

MARIA THINS
Well girl Whats to be done

GRIET says nothing

MARIA THINS (CONTD)
You may fool the men with your downcast eyes
Master Van Ruijven wants his paintings and he
will bear no more delay

MARIA THINS bony hand on the black cane trembles for the first
time she seems vulnerable frightened even

MARIA THINS (CONTD)
Ive protected you for his sake and yours but
if he crosses Van Ruijven over this he will lose
him Then what

It makes her angry to be so helpless begging a maid for help
She glares at GRIET

MARIA THINS (CONTD)
Flood water seeps under the door and the house
comes down I wont let that happen here
November 2003

EXT COURTYARD DAY

GRIET hangs up sheets in the courtyard Strong arms grab her
from behind pinning her arms by her side A voice whispers
thick and hot in her ear

VAN RUIJVEN
Got you

GRIET struggles silently terrified but VAN RUIJVEN is far
stronger

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
Hold still I want to look at you

GRIET writhes to get free scared and angry
He turns her round to face him swathed in sheets

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)

Tell me girl how do you get on up there Has
he found his composition Do you inspire him Do
you move him Does the Masters brush unlock the
secrets of your heart

His tone is leering but his sharp eyes miss nothing He can read
Griets face exactly

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
No Ripe as a plum and still unplucked

VAN RUIJVEN is disconcerted angry he did not expect this

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
What is he playing at

She looks away face hidden by her cap He pulls is back

roughly A grunt of satisfaction as his hand tangles in her
hair

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
He made a bargain you know he paints you at my
pleasure

He is right up against her again She pushes him away he grabs
her wrists GRIET writhes to get free scared and angry He
holds both her wrists with one hand yanks the chemise of her
shoulder with the other

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)

I have waited long enough What a great fool he
is

He paws at her skirts her legs give way and she starts to fall
He twists one arm behind her back forcing her up again

November 2003

GRIETS eyes search desperately for something to stop him In
the shadow of the passage she sees someone watching

CORNELIA GRIET pleads with her eyes CORNELIA returns her look
her face cat-like impenetrable She turns away slowly
deliberately disappears GRIET wants to cry

VAN RUIJVEN is unbuckling himself GRIET struggles harder
manages to free one arm claw at his face He snarls They
wrestle till he has both arms pinned again

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
Dont fight me girl

Breathing hard he crushes her against the copper grotesque
reflections swim in front of her

CATHARINA(OS)
(Petulant) Griet Griet

She is coming along the corridor towards the back of the house
VAN RUIJVEN lets GRIET go quickly straightens his clothing

VAN RUIJVEN
Not a word Youll lose your place He‘d never
look at you again

He steps out to meet CATHARINA all smiles

VAN RUIJVEN (CONTD)
Ah my dear There you are Your maid kept me
with some cock and bull story

INT ATTIC DAWN

Cold dawn light GRIET slides her finger through fine-ground
rose madder a red streak across the stone table Her torn
chemise waits to be mended

EXT COURTYARD DAY

GRIET pours water into the copper every movement an effort
arms like lead Someone grabs her from behind

MAERTGE
Surprise

GRIET spins round ready to fight - to find MAERTGE and the
other CHILDREN all smiling at her MAERTGE has a package which
she hands over shyly

MAERTGE (CONTD)
For your name day I made it

CORNELIA
I thought of the surprise

November 2003

A perfectly innocent smile With trembling hands GRIET unwraps
her present a child-made lace collar

GRIET
Thank you

The CHILDREN clamour for her to put it on She holds it up to
her neck - there are bruises from where VAN RUIJVEN held her -
and they admire her

MAERTGE
Youre beautiful

CORNELIA
Take off your cap Then you’1ll look like a lady

That tell-tale smirk GRIET pulls off the collar

GRIET
Ive work to do

INT GREAT HALL DAY

GRIET is on her hands and knees clearing the grate MARIA THINS
comes in hurriedly

MARIA THINS
My daughter is out for the day

She unlocks CATHARINAS jewel box

MARIA THINS (CONTD)
Do it now

She thrusts the open box towards GRIET who is still wiping the
smuts from her hands Reluctantly she takes the pearl earrings
out of their velvet nest The seconds seem to crawl

INT STUDIO DAY

VERMEER watches GRIET her partner in this slow dance She takes
off her cap puts on the turban Rubs the oil of cloves onto her
ear lobe Heats the needle in a candle flame

She holds out the earrings

GRIET
You do it

Her eyes widen at her own boldness He opens his mouth to speak
then says nothing

He steps up to the chair and takes the pearls
Mixing oil into lead-white oozing creamily under the sharp

knife
November 2003

He touches her earlobe she gasps He rubs the soft flesh
between his forefinger and thumb then pulls it taut and with his
other hand pierces her skin with the needle A scarlet globe of
blood glistens on the white skin He takes a breath forces the
twisted silver wire of the earring through the hole

The pain is excruciating her eyes brim with tears

Laying on a grey ghost of paint among shadows the under-layer
of the pearl

His fingers brush her jaw gently trace the bruises on her neck
She closes her eyes inhaling his smell

A thick white clot of paint twisted off the brush in a moment
for the highlight

He blots the tears that spill down her cheek and rubs his wet
thumb slowly along her lips her open mouth

Pale sable hairs across the crimson of her lips a trail of
white

EXT DELFT STREETS NIGHT

GRIET pushes her way through busy streets

INT TAVERN NIGHT

The benches are crowded a jostling careless press Admiring
catcalls and whistles follow GRIET as she makes her way through
the DRINKERS

PIETER’S back is turned he doesn’t see her approach His FRIEND
nudges him and moves away PIETER stares in frank astonishment

PIETER
Griet

She takes him by the hand and leads him out

EXT ALLEY DAY

A narrow alley behind the BEAST MARKET the bellowing of CATTLE
mixes into the background clatter GRIET tugs PIETER after her
presses him against the wall Pulls his face down to hers and
kisses him passionately He responds bewildered but thrilled
She moves his hand to her backside turning till she is against
the wall She closes her eyes PIETER doesn’t question his good
fortune

LATER

PIETER watches as GRIET carefully adjusts her clothes smoothes
her hair under her white cap He pulls out a long wavy strand
and kisses it joyfully intimate

November 2003

PIETER
Sweet Griet
She reties her cap Her ear is bleeding a little

PIETER (CONTD)
Griet dont rush away Where are you going

He grabs her by the shoulders so she must face him
PIETER (CONTD)
Leave that house join me and Paul at the
Market

She meets his eyes levelly very still

GRIET
I have to go back
PIETER
Ill fetch your things Well send someone
GRIET
No
PIETER

Griet Our own life Answering to no one Don’t
go Marry me

She puts a hand on his cheek kisses him Walks away
He leans against the wall head down
INT GREAT HALL DAY

GRIET drops the earrings in MARIA THINS’ wrinkled hand A whore
and her madam

CORNELIA watches from the bed her cat-like eyes unblinking
INT STUDIO DAY

CLOSE ON the raised lid of the harpsichord GRIET cleans the
studio alone and silent The Concert painting is on the easel
almost finished The other - her painting - is propped against
the wall covered She avoids them both

VOICES are raised downstairs an almighty row is brewing

INT STAIRS OUTSIDE STUDIO DAY

Feet tumbling up the stairs CORNELIA’S little shoes leading

November 2003

INT STUDIO DAY

GRIET braces herself The door crashes open a tidal wave of
anger and distress

CATHARINA
No I will not be calm Am I a child Does no
one speak the truth to me in my own house

CORNELIA is snivelling frightened by her MOTHER’S passion
MARIA THINS
By all the Saints if you would stop screaming
for a moment I can expl-
CATHARINA
More lies I don’t want to hear any more of your
lies Mother I have a right to know

But finding herself at last in the forbidden room CATHARINA
falls silent afraid

VERMEER is the last to enter quietly the eye of the storm He
meets GRIETS eyes across the room

CATHARINA recovers herself a little
CATHARINA (CONTD)
So No more hiding now Here I am I want to see
this painting
VERMEER makes a weary gesture

VERMEER
There’s no point

CATHARINA flares up again
CATHARINA
No point I am too stupid to look at a painting
now

A savage finger at GRIET

CATHARINA (CONTD)
She cant read You know that

MARIA THINS pulls forward a chair

MARIA THINS
Sit down you’ll exhaust yourself

CATHARINA ignores her
CATHARINA
Why can’t I look What have you done

November 2003
VERMEER is by the easel his accustomed place

VERMEER

It’s a commission Gone in a few days You need
never see

CATHARINA is laughing and crying Sinks onto the chair in the
middle of the room

MARIA THINS

Theyre just paintings Pictures for money They
mean nothing

CATHARINA
(Desperate)
Is it true she wore my pearls

VERMEER cannot answer CATHARINA groans in anguish

CATHARINA (CONTD)
How could you How could you

She heaves herself up and stands in front of The Concert
painting breathing heavily staring Then she bursts out
laughing

CATHARINA (CONTD)
Hes backwards Backwards Look at him - fat

arse spilling off the chair My God I’m not the
only one that’s been had

MARIA THINS laughs too her dry cracked laugh

MARIA THINS

Thats right He wanted a portrait and he got
one

CATHARINA
And there’s yours Mother

She points at the old hag in the Procuress painting

CATHARINA (CONTD)

I always hated that picture and now I know why
My mother the whore-monger

VERMEER
Catharina Enough

CATHARINA blinks turns round slowly to him A wide dangerous
smile

CATHARINA

Why Was painting enough for him Was it enough
for you (A beat) Show me the other

November 2003

VERMEER
Youll make yourself ill

VERMEER moves towards her slowly cautiously She stares at him
with shining eyes then quick as a snake grabs a palette knife

from the work table

CATHARINA
Show me

VERMEER faces her arms wide palms out

VERMEER
Very well

Never taking his eyes from her he lifts down the Concert
painting and puts the other on the easel Tenderly lifts the

cover Everyone cranes to look GRIET behind the easel can see

only their reactions

VERMEER looks oddly peaceful a work achieved MARIA THINS

glances at GRIET her lips a thin bitter line her eyes warning

silence CATHARINA’S face sags mouth agape
CATHARINA
(A whisper) Its obscene Everyone will see
your sin
She gasps for breath The words are torn from her

CATHARINA (CONTD)
(Anguished) Why don’t you paint me

VERMEER
Because you don’t understand

CATHARINA
And she does

Her words hang in the air the truth

Suddenly she lunges at the painting with the knife But VERMEER

is too quick for her grabs her wrist so hard it hurts she
cries out

He is blazing his fury all the more terrifying for its
quietness She goes limp in his grasp and he lets her go

CATHARINA backs away finds CORNELIA to cling to A single
glance of hatred at GRIET

CATHARINA (CONTD)
Get her out of here Get out of my house

GRIET has been waiting for this but even so it falls like a
whiplash

November 2003

Her eyes seek out VERMEER although she can hear CATHARINA’S in-
drawn hiss of fury He is infinitely sad infinitely distant

INT GREAT HALL DAY

Wearing her Sunday best clothes GRIET takes her aprons and caps
from the linen cupboard CATHARINA’S yellow mantle hangs there
silky smooth and glowing

GRIET’S hand runs along the rim of the silver bowl a last
glimpse of its multi-fractured reflections

INT VERMEER HOUSE DAY

Carrying her small bundle GRIET walks through the series of
rooms TANNEKE stands framed in the Cooking Kitchen doorway
arms folded Left to manage alone again

INT CORRIDOR OUTSIDE STUDIO DAY

GRIET goes up the stairs and along the corridor to the STUDIO
The door is shut fast She stands outside listening Silence

INT STUDIO DAY

VERMEER sits on his painting stool every nerve strained to
listen wanting her to come in but unable to call her His
painting hand is balled tight as a fist

He hears GRIETS footsteps leaving

VERMEER is left alone in the studio a blank canvas waiting on
the easel behind him

EXT VERMEER HOUSE DAY

GRIET walks away from the house her bundle under her arm She
wont look back

INT VAN RUIJVENS CABINET - DAY

VAN RUIJVEN sits alone in his cabinet with the painting of
GRIET It gives him no pleasure after all He draws a curtain
over it

EXT DELFT MARKET SQUARE - DAY

GRIET walks across the great Market Square Other people carry
on with their everyday lives but the sound is muffled and
distant she is lost in her own world

She stops on the brick star at the centre of the square

November 2003

INT GRIET’S HOUSE DAY

GRIET sits in the late afternoon sun near the back doorway
finishing her headdress Her wedding dress is laid out on the
bed other wedding preparations visible in the background
TANNEKE appears at the door out of breath

A moment’s silence as they size each other up

TANNEKE
I’ve come to the right place then

GRIET
Good Day Tanneke

TANNEKE
So it’s true you’re to be married

GRIET
Yes

TANNEKE nods taking it in

TANNEKE
We use another butcher nowadays

She searches in her apron pocket and brings out a small cloth
wrapped package She hands it to GRIET

TANNEKE (CONTD)
For you I had to bring it myself never mind
that the dinner’s left to spoil Men

She stops abruptly GRIET holds the package gingerly not daring
to look at it

TANNEKE (CONTD)
Best be off then

GRIET
I‘ll see you to the bridge

TANNEKE
No need for that

She turns away her face working

GRIET
Thank you Tanneke

Left alone GRIET uncurls the hand gripping the package She
takes a deep breath then undoes the layers of cloth the
familiar blue of the turban And there nestled in the folds of
fabric lie the pearl earrings

November 2003

GRIET holds up one pale globe fathoming its meaning her eyes
shining with pent up tears

FADE TO BLACK
FADE UP ON

A very slow pull back reveals the real painting Girl With A
Pearl Earring

Cracked and aged but no less beautiful or immediate A girls
face as brim full of emotion as if she were looking at us now
