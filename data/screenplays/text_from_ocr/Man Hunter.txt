CuT TO

EXT ATLANTA STREET - WIDE - NIGHT

Small poplars line the curb It rained The sidewalks are
wet They are drying in splotches The street is deserted
The front walk vertically bisects the FRAME An Atlanta
Police department car pulls to the curb and stops The door
opens lighting the interior and Will Graham starts out the
passenger side

GRAHAM
(distant)
Thanks for the lift

OFFICER
Ill come inside with you if you
like but Mr Crawford said youd
probably want to be alone

GRAHAM
Thats right

OFFTCER
Theres a VTR setup waiting in your
hotel room that you asked for
They transferred the home movies of
both families once half-inch VHS

GRAHAM
(getting out)
Thanks

Graham exits the car and walks TOWARDS us We PAN AROUND as
he moves through EXTREME CLOSEUP and see the Leeds family house
with all of the Atlanta Police department crime scene postings
Graham doesnt enter the front door Be walks around the side

CUT TO

INT LEEDS HOUSE KITCHEN - WIDE - NIGHT

Three big sliding glass doors The center one has been re-
placed with plywood Its dark A flashlights beam starts
playing through the bushes in the side yard then the light
appears and blasts IN the LENS It lights lots of dishes in
the sink The dark kitchen looks like anybodys kitchen The
house feels occupied The Leeds possessions have been
undisturbed

CLOSE GLASS DOOR

We hear the lock click and the door slide open as Graham
enters Its like hes a burglar

GRAHAMS FEET

walk through the kitchen as if he knows where he is going
A thermostat clicks and air conditioning comes on loudly
Grahams feet pass our of frame

INT LEEDS HOUSE SECOND STORY - FLOOR

is empty The carpet is dark We hear Grahams footsteps

up the stairs Then his feet enter the frame and a flash-
light beam hits the carpet It dwells on a couple of dark
stains Track with Grahams feet to the entry to the master
bedroom The bedroom is dark We see nothing

INT LEEDS MASTER BEDROOM - LIGHT SWITCH
Grahams hand enters He hits the light switch

BLOOD
screams at us from the walls

CLOSE GRAHAM
doesnt visibly react

WIDER - GRAHAM

moves into the room The bloodstains are extensive Half
the walls look like a monochromatic Jackson Pollock The
mirrors are smashed Taped outlines on the mattress indi-
cate where the bodies had been found Graham opens the
file he carries containing autopsy lab and crime reports

OVERHEAD ANGLE - GRAHAM

standing alone in the middle of the master bedroom The
crime scene -- the disarray the big splashes of arterial
blood on the walls the smashed mirrors taped outlines or
bodies -- is a testament to a violence that is pornographic
Graham pulls out a tape recorder and starts dictating his
own notes thumbing through various reports for reference

GRAHAM
intruder entered through kitchen
sliding door Probably a glass
cutter Why didnt he care that he
left AB saliva on the glass it was
hot out that night inside the
house must have been pleasantly cool
to him

(beat)

The intruder cut Charles Leeds
throat as he lay asleep beside Mrs
Leeds He shot Mrs Leeds as she was
rising Bullet entered the right of
her navel and lodged in her lumbar
spine but she died of strangulation
increase of serotonin and free
histimine levels in the gunshot wound
indicates she lived at least five
minutes after she was shot All

her other injuries were post-mortem

(beat
Then he went toward the childrens
room

(beat)
Direction and velocity of blood
stains on the east wall indicate
arterial spray With his throat
cut Mr Leeds still tried to fight
Because the intruder was moving to
the childrens room

(beat)
in the childrens room the intruder
shot the first boy in bed Second
boy was found in bed but dustballs
indicate he was dragged out from
under his bed to be shot

(MORE)

GRAHAM (CONTD)
(beat)

Profusion of bloodstains and matted
sliding marks on hall carpet and
west wall of master bedroom remain
unexplained as does superficial

ligature mark around Mr Leeds
chest believed to be post-mortem
What did the killer do with them
after they were dead And before
he put the boys back in their beds

CuT TO

ZNT LEEDS BATHROOM - MEDICINE CABINET - NIGHT

He rests his hands on the sides of the sink He turns on
the water He pops two pills cups his hands under the
faucet and drinks He looks at himself in the mirror Be
is breathing normally Over his shoulder he sees

ZOOM INTO MRS LEEDS PANTYHOSE

still hanging on a towel railing over the bathtub Graham
is staring at the normal domesticity of a family bathroom
He doesnt let it unnerve him

CuT TO

EXT LEEDS HOUSE PORCH ROOF - WIDE - NIGHT

The window opens and Graham climbs onto the porch roof and
sits on the gritty shingles Were looking for a distressed
reaction There is none Graham is clamped down Beyond
him the lights of Atlanta and the stars are brilliant
More brilliant than they ought to be The Delta Aquirid
meteor showers at its maximum This is not a normal image
He takes out his tape recorder again

GRAHAM
Theres a wicker dog bed on the back
porch Theres a doghouse in the
back yard Wheres the dog
HOLD ON Graham

INT ATLANTA HYATT HOUSE ELEVATOR - WIDE - NIGHT

Graham riding up with two half-drunk CONVENTIONEERS with big
Hi badges One Conventioneer is looking over at the lobby

CONVENTIONEER 1

CONVENTIONEER 2

The other cracks up

GRAHAM

snaps alert and stares at Conventioneer 2

CONVENTIONEER 2

sips his gin and tonic senses Grahams stare He smiles

CONVENTIONEER 1

Graham looks away The elevator stops The door opens
Conventioneer 1 drags Conventioneer 2

CONVENTIONEER 1
(being pulled out
of elevator)
What are you a faggot

Both Conventioneers laugh as they walk down the hall
Conventioneer 1 wiggles his fat hips and apes a limp wrist
Graham looks away

of the master bedroom The bloodstains are represented in
outline Three are along the left wall The arterial
splashes from Mr Leeds are on the right wall Mr and Mrs
Leeds body positions are indicated on the king-size mat-
tress

GRAHAM

(into the tape

recorder)
When they were dead -- except

the mirrors and began selecting
shards that he used later on Mrs
Leeds What did he do in the
interval Struggling with Mr

take less than a minute What

DR CHILTON - DAY

DR CHILTON
Dr Bloom called me yesterday Mr
Graham Or should I call you Dr
Graham

GRAHAM (0S)
Im not a doctor
(beat)
I need to see Lecter in as much
privacy as possible

TWO SHOT
Graham sits in front of his desk in a chair He appears
repressed clamped down Dr Chilton is a sincere Chief of
Staff but not gifted

DR CHILTON
Dr Lecter will stay in his room
That is absolutely the only place
where he is not put in full body
restraints One wall of his room
is a double barrier I will have
a chair put just outside
GRAHAM
I might have to show him some
material that could stimulate him

DR CHILTON
As long as its on soft paper
You may(Pause) find this curious

He pulls an EKG tape from a drawer and points to the
spiky lines

DR CHILTON

Here Lecters resting on the
examining table getting an
electrocardiogram Complained of
chest pains Pulse seventy-two
Here he grabs the nurses head and
pulls her down to him Here hes
subdued by the attendant and
Lecters shoulder is dislocated
Do you notice the strange thing

(pause)
His pulse never got over eighty-
five Even when he tore into her
face

Dr Chilton looks over at Graham perhaps expecting a
response There is nothing to read in Grahams face It
a blank

DR CHILTON
The consensus around here is that
the only person who has demonstrated
any practical understanding of Dr
Hannibal Lecter is you Mr Graham
Can you tell me anything about him

GRAHAM
No

DR CHILTON
When you saw Dr Lecktors murders
their style so to speak were you
able to reconstruct his fantasies
And did that help you identify him

DR CHILTON
looks at Graham Dr Chilton has seen a lot of hostility
Right now hes seeing some more

GRAHAM
(stands)
I want to see Lecktor now

DR CHILTON
Uh sure

INT MAXIMUM SECURITY SECTION - DOOR - DAY

occupant cant get at someone sitting in front of him In
the perspex square is a letter -- passing drawer In the
cell -- laying on his bunk -- is DR HANNIBAL LECKTOR He
appears to be asleep His back is to Graham He has not
stirred Then

LECKTOR
Thats the same atrocious aftershave
you wore in court three years ago

GRAHAM
I keep getting it for Christmas

CLOSE LECKTORS HEAD

turns to us His small eyes drill into Grahams brain
Lecktors attitude is professionally psychiatric as if Graham
is the patient
LECKTOR
Did you get my card

GRAHAM

I got it Thank you

GRAHAM S
struggle will be to keep locked-down inside himself all his
emotional reactions
LECKTOR
And how is Officer Stuart The one
who was the first to see my basement

GRAHAM
Stuart is fine

LECKTOR
Emotional problems I hear He was
a very promising young officer Do
you ever have any problems Will

GRAHAM
No
LECKTOR
Of course you dont
(pause)

Im glad you came My callers are

all professional Clinical
psychiatrists from cornfield colleges
somewhere Second-raters the lot

GRAHAM
Dr Bloom showed me your article on
surgical addiction in the journal
of Clinical Psychiatry

LECKTOR
And

GRAHAM
Very interesting even to a layman

Lecktor rolls around and examines the term layman in his
head Then

LECKTOR
A layman layman Interesting
term So many experts on government
grants And you say youre a
layman But it was you who caught
me wasnt it Will Do you know
how you did it

GRAHAM
Youve read the transcript Its
all there

LECKTOR
No its not Do you know how you
Did it Will

GRAHAM
Its in the transcript What does
it matter now
LECKTOR
(smiles)
It doesnt matter to me Will

GRAHAM
I want you to help me Dr Lecktor

LECKTOR
Yes I thought so

GRAHAM
Its about Atlanta and Birmingham

LECKTOR
Yes

GRAHAM
You read about it Im sure

LECKTOR

In the papers I dont rear out the
articles

(laughs)
I wouldnt want them to think I was
dwelling on anything morbid You
want to know how hes choosing them
dont you

GRAHAM
I thought you would have some ideas

LECKTOR
Why should I tell you

GRAHAM
There are things you dont have
Research materials I could speak

to the Chief of Staff

LECKTOR
Chilton Gruesome isnt he He
fumbles at your head like a freshman
pulling at a panty girdle
(laugh )
He actually tries to give me a
Thematic and Apperception test
Hah Sat there waiting for MF-13 to
come up Its a card with a woman
in bed and a man in the foreground
I was supposed to avoid a sexual
interpretation I laughed in his
face

(beat)
Never mind its boring

GRAHAM
Youll get to see the file on this
case And theres another reason

LECKTOR
Pray tell

GRAHAM
I thought you might be curious to
find our if youre smarter than
the person Im looking for

LECKTOR
Then by implication you think that
you are smarter than me since you
caught me

GRAHAM
No I knew that Im nor smarter
than you are

LECKTOR
Then how did you catch me Will

GRAHAM
You had disadvantages

LECKTOR
What disadvantage

GRAHAM
Youre insane

LECKTOR
Youre very tan Will

Graham does not answer If anything happens there is a
tightening of the musculature repressing his reactions to
Lecktor

LECKTOR
Your hands are rough They dont
look like a cop s hands anymore
That shaving lotion is something a
child would select It has a ship
on the bottle doesnt it

Another silence Lecktors eyes look as if theyre drilling
into Grahams head trying to find out things Trying to
find a way to hurt Graham Hes very threatening Then
relaxes

LECKTOR
Dont think you can persuade me with
appeals to my intellectual vanity

GRAHAM
I dont think Ill persuade you
Youll do it or you wont Dr
Bloom is working an it anyway and
hes the best

LECKTOR
(interrupts)
Do you have the file with you

GRAHAM
Yes

GRAHAM
Yes
LECKTOR

consider it

GRAHAM
No

LECKTOR

GRAHAM
Good-bye Dr Lecktor

LECKTOR

my books yet

Graham gets up and starts to walk away

LECKTOR

tell you what I think

Graham stops at the door before he knocks for the attendant
Then he folds the abridged file tightly into the sliding
tray Lecktor pulls it through

GRAHAM
sits in the chair He wants a cigarette He doesnt take
one He waits And he watches What he sees

no shoelaces the wall seatless toilet bowl etc etc

All the objects are brilliantly lit with sharp bluish light
Their edges are sharper and more defined than normal The
shadows of the bars make hard-edged stripes It is a high
resolution highly brilliant sec of images It feels like a
hyper-perception of reality a super-realism perceived by the
mind of Graham It is interrupted when

LECKTOR (0S)
There is a very shy boy Will
GRAHAM
snaps back to the present looks at Lecktor

LECKTOR
What were the yards like

GRAHAM
Big backyards fences some hedges
why

LECKTOR

Because my dear Will if this
Pilgrim imagines he has a
relationship with the full moon

he might go outside and look at it
Have you seen blood in moonlight
Will It appears quite black If
one were nude it would be better
to have outdoor privacy for this
sort of thing

GRAHAM
Thats interesting

LECKTOR
Its not interesting You thought

of it before

GRAHAM
Yes Id considered it

LECKTOR
You came here to look at me Will
To get the old scent again didnt
you

GRAHAM

LECKTOR

hes psychic What he has it empathy
and projection He can assume your
point of view and mine and some
other points of view that scare and
sicken him

concerned about him And hed

Could he kill again if he had to save
his life Or would he hesitate

year-old daughters throat Graham
shot him with his 38 six times
Hobbs still didnt go down He had
to wade in

CRAWFORD
Thats when it happened

BLOOM
No It happened when Graham went
to see Hobbs daughter four months
later in the hospital She saved
her carotid artery but lost
three fingers and her larynx She
was connected up to a voice box
When Graham went to see her she
asked him -- through the speaker
Why did you have to kill my
daddy

breakdown

fairy Plus smeared bloodstains
indicate that he put the shorts on

I believe he did this to emphasize
his lack of interest in Mr Leeds

psychotic landscape of the mind Grahams psyche resonates
with echoes of Dollarhyde Now he gets up and walks out of
the room leaving the door open Outside is only the deserted
parking lot

Then he nods Then he leaves

GEORGE SHERMAN

didnt get to say what he wanted to say to Graham

CUT TO

EXT SHERMAN HOUSE - WIDE FROM DOOR GRAHAM - NIGHT

away from us towards the waiting cab The rain pelts his
black hat and black raincoat Before he reaches the cab

CUT TO

EXT BEACH (MARATHON FLORIDA)- GRAHAM - DAY

sitting with his back to us Beyond him the sun reflects
off the crashing surf and burns out everything except the
silhouetted image of Graham

GRAHAM IS WATCHING

the fenced-in area of beach he and Kevin built at the opening
of the film A baby tortoise crawls over sand mountains and
is swept away by surf into the life-supporting sea
CLOSE GRAHAM

drinks a beer He senses a presence and starts to turn

WIDE REAR SHOT BEACH CRAHAM

turns towards us Molly ENTERS THE FRAME Her coat is
under her arm She drops it and her flight Sag in the sand
and continues walking to Graham

GRAHAM

stands as she comes near him The aqua highlights of the
water eat into their figures as they look at each other
Molly touches the wounded side of his face Then

MOLLY
Lets forget who said what to whom

GRAHAM
You got a deal

Graham takes Mollys hand
WATERS EDGE

Molly and Graham walk to the waters edge and look out to sea
The highlights burn out sections of the two people

MOLLY
So howd we do

Graham looks at her He touches the side of her cheek and
her hair She pushes against his hand with her face to make
closer contact

GRAHAM
We did okay
(beat)
Most of them made it

REARSHOT GRAHAM MOLLY

Graham -- in the sunbleached violet shorts -- lays an arm
across Mollys shoulder Mollys arm moves around Grahams
waist They look out to sea In front of them the surf
kicks up drops of spray which take light and become brilliant
atoms
