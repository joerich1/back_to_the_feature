First over BLACK a SEAGULL with a battle cry Waves pound
the levees gently foreboding

INT JEAN’S BATHROOM - NIGHT 1

Hallucinatory CLOSE UPS flutter in and out of frame
A TAP turns on filling a stained blue sink

LATEX GLOVES peeled over gaunt pale hands

A TIN pops open dust particles dancing in the light
A PASTE forms effervescing

JEAN NEWMAN 32 stands in front of a vanity mirror touching
up her roots with a small wooden brush Deliberate precise
movements Almost surgical

There’s something gloriously enigmatic about our JEAN Her
short blonde hair lends an almost translucent quality to her
skin She’s both plain and alluring and all the gradations
in between As she steps back to inspect her handiwork the
mirror casts a ripple effect one face refracted out
multiple times

INT JEAN’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 2

The back of JEAN’s head now caked with dye The TV flickers
beyond some kitschy eighties commercial

JEAN’s house is functional modest and ordered A distinct
lack of memorabilia

A loud RUMBLE from outside a car pulling up JEAN’s cat
PEGGY leaps off the record player dashing up the stairs A
dusty shard of light severs the room in two

JEAN puts down the remote moving towards the kitchen

The SOUND of the car pulling away outside as JEAN reaches the
window She stands there for a moment before padding back to
the sofa A familiar nasal bray engulfs the room

CILLA BLACK
Let’s hear it for the lovely Mark
ladies and gentlemen
(studio applause)
But for now come in the girls
(studio applause)

Garish TV light ripples over JEAN’s face
INT JEAN’S BATHROOM LATER 3
Toxic chemicals trickle down the plughole JEAN kneels over

the bath rinsing her hair Reaching for a towel she rubs
dry newly white hair stands and flicks off the light

INT JEAN’S CAR - DAY 4

Low winter sun filters through threadbare trees as JEAN’s
Renault traverses the outskirts of the city A set of
NEWCASTLE FC dice swing from the rearview mirror In the
distance a line of industrial buildings pollute the air with
a thick black fug

BBC RADIO NEWS
NHS workers are staging their first
strike in more than thirty years
today Staff including midwives
nurses ambulance crews porters
and office workers are all taking
part in the strike over wages
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
condemns the strike saying it will
prolong wait lists and desert
patients

JEAN lights a cigarette and winds down the window

INT SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY 5

JEAN strides through labyrinthine school halls with purpose
a cassette player under one arm Shrill voices waft down the
drab corridor

CHORUS (0C)
Give me courage when the world is
rough Keep me loving though the
world is tough Leap and sing in
all I do

HELEN 40s - blonde and svelte stands on a step ladder
creating a display of Sub-Saharan masks She smiles as JEAN
passes JEAN smiles back but it’s guarded rehearsed even

A feral freckled redhead appears stuffing a sheet of paper
excitedly into JEAN’s hands SIOBHAN 15 appears older than
her years brooding with a sort of sultry sexuality A gold
crucifix glints over the collar of her shirt

On JEAN a different smile here genuine and gently goading
SIOBHAN
What

JEAN offers her a moment to fess up displaying her unique
ability to remain aloof yet humane in the same moment

JEAN
I could forge your nan’s signature
better than this Siobhan

SIOBHAN
But--

JEAN
Want me to call her

SIOBHAN
No Don’t

JEAN eyes on SIOBHAN as she weighs up how much to divulge
then thinks better of it Silence Then--

JEAN
If there’s a problem at home you
can tell me you know
(beat)
Can’t have me star player missing
any more matches can I

High praise indeed SIOBHAN melts
JEAN (CONTD)
Anyhow shouldn’t you’s be in

assembly

SIOBHAN flashes a naughty grin and disappears just as PAULA
50s - buxom no-nonsense pushes past JEAN into the office

PAULA
You and your bloody fan club

JEAN smiles awkwardly as she follows PAULA into the office

INT SPORTS HALL - DAY 6

TEENAGE GIRLS all talking over each other A whistle between
JEAN’s teeth Staccato bursts

JEAN
There’1l be plenty of time to
gossip at break time
JEAN has the air of a team captain rather than an
authoritarian As such she is listened to

The U16 netball team swarm into frame But we’re fixed on
JEAN never acknowledging the girls in much detail

JEAN (CONTD)
Would you like to take the class
yourself Carol

Collective sniggers fade to silence

JEAN (CONTD)
Right Can anyone tell me what
“fight or flight” means

A sea of blank faces

JEAN (CONTD)
I’m not just talking about netball
Fight or flight Any ideas

No response Except CAROL RIDLEY 15 miming a blozza behind
MINDY SINGH 15 a gauche bespectacled girl with prolific
eyebrows JEAN sighs

JEAN (CONTD)
You can see me after okay Carol

JEAN bites down on the end of her biro thinks for a second
then without warning lobs the ball out from under her arm
towards the group SIOBHAN catches it

JEAN (CONTD)
There you see Instincts I’m
talking about instincts

SIOBHAN tries unsuccessfully to hide her satisfaction

JEAN (CONTD)

The body responds far quicker than
the brain

(beat)
In the case of sudden danger
hormones rush through our bodies
prompting us to stay and fight or
run away and flee--

CUT ABRUPTLY TO
INT CHANGING ROOMS - DAY

GIRLS in various states of undress apply makeup in the
mirror JILL CHAR and ANOTHER GIRL all 15 are taking
things at a particularly leisurely pace JEAN strides in
holding a clip-board keeping her eye-line vague

JEAN
This is not a beauty parlour Get
cracking please ladies

CAROL
(under her breath)
How would you know what a beauty
parlour looks like

0C giggles

JEAN
We were all young and dumb once
you know Carol

Laughter Touché

JEAN (CONTD)
You did a good job out there
Rachel if you carry on like that
youll be able to take on the sixth
formers by the end of term

RACHEL 15 smiling coy SIOBHAN glancing over a hint of
jealousy peeking through

INT SHOWERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

JEAN claps her hands as she passes by the showers never
stopping to linger

JEAN
You’s should be dressed by now
come along ladies

CAROL (0C)
Ewww Miss What are you looking at
Get out ya perve

Unperturbed JEAN tosses a towel in their direction

An old fashioned SCHOOL BELL rattles through the corridors
THUNDEROUS footsteps as students decamp for lunch

INT DINING ROOM - DAY 9

JEAN sits alone at a table A group of TEACHERS chat
animatedly behind her Rain lashes down on the windows
giving the impression her reflection is melting

MRS LEA (0C)
Martin’s got me on this new diet
have you heard of it It’s called
SlimFast Just pour one of these
into a pint of milk one in the
morning one at night Martin says
I’1l be wasting away by Easter

Raucous laughter from the group

JEAN catches eyes with SIOBHAN JILL and CHAR who’re sitting
at a nearby table mimicking the teachers’ reactions so only
they can see The GIRLS laugh grateful to be in on the joke

OMITTED 10

INT PE DEPARTMENT OFFICE - DAY 11
In the phone booth JEAN leafs through an address book

At the window nearby DAVE 50s - vampiric booze addled and
MICHELLE 20s - a spirited brunette from Derby are watching
something at the window chatting in hushed tones Even from
afar it reeks of gossip JEAN stands moving towards the
window

Outside in the playground a TEENAGE GIRL glides into focus
She’s playing football with a group of BOYS This is LOIS
JACKSON 15 There’s a contrariness to her spirit apparent
even on first sight Bold and untamed but at the same time
vulnerable and somewhat incomplete

JEAN follows her across the tarmac quietly mesmerised LOIS
has an ease in her own body And she’s fast Easily out-
running the boys

DAVE
It’s a waste in’t it

MICHELLE
Why’s that

DAVE
She wont be needing that footwork
on the netball court will she

JEAN
You could always sign her up

DAVE
And you’1l take the boys for
netball too will you

JEAN
I don’t see why not

MICHELLE beams in agreement But JEAN’s already heading out
the door leaving a disgruntled DAVE in the office

EXT SCHOOL CAR PARK - DUSK 12

JEAN throws a duffle bag into the boot of her car A few
metres away LOIS emerges from the school entrance closely
followed by a gang of BOYS They appear to be making fun of
her MICHELLE appears behind JEAN--

MICHELLE
Fancy a pint Few of us are heading
down The Lodge

But JEAN is watching LOIS

JEAN
Sorry -- Oh I can’t I’m minding
my nephew tonight

MICHELLE
Friday night Hope they’re paying
ya

JEAN smiles vaguely looking back to where LOIS was But
she’s gone A flicker of disappointment

INT JEAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 13

JEANs wiry half-naked frame on the bed pulling on a pair
of well loved 501’s She stands reaching into a wardrobe
organised with military precision School on the right
Denims in the middle The barely worn remnants of another
life on the left A portable radio crackles beside her bed

RADIO VOICE OF IAN MCKELLEN (0S)
Mr Worsthorne actually thinks a
book can turn someone into a
homosexual I don’t believe that
anymore than a book could have
turned me into a heterosexual

JEAN smiles and reaches for a thin silver chain fastening it
around her neck

PEREGUINE WORSTHORNE (0S)
I regard homosexuality as being a
great misfortune the less frequent
it is in any society the better
It shouldn’t be something that
anybody should be allowed to
encourage or promote certainly
not any schools that are funded by
local authorities that people have
to go to by law

JEAN pulls on a jacket checking herself in the mirror

EXT VENUS BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT 14

JEAN stops at the entrance to a dive bar checking both ways
before heading in

INT VENUS BAR - NIGHT 15

We follow JEAN down some stairs and into a dimly lit bat-cave
teeming with dykes cigarette smoke and booze At the bar
JEAN greets ACE 20s - handsome and ACE’s girlfriend DEBBIE
30s - warm leather clad

Then another WOMAN appears handing JEAN a beer kissing her
on the mouth This is VIVIAN HIGHTON 30s - hard on the
outside soft in the middle like a Tunnocks Tea Cake JEAN
whispers something in her ear and they laugh

INT VENUS - LATER 16

Four shot glasses snatched off a pool table JEAN eyeing hers
suspiciously

VIV
Aw come on Baby Jean

JEAN
Stop calling me that

VIV
Suits ya

VIV’s accent is more acute than JEAN’s more working class
Flashing her infectious smile she pinches the soft infant-
like flesh of JEAN’s cheek

JEAN
LAUGHS Get off

ACE
Down it or I’1l have it

Outnumbered JEAN holds her nose grabs the shot glass and
pours the disgusting clear liquid down her throat She
winces The others laugh

VIV
OK lightweight Your shot

JEAN places the glass on a window sill wiping excess tequila
from her mouth lining up her shot slowly Tuning out drunken
input from the other three BAM She takes the shot One ball
-- then a second -- then a third

Three dumbstruck faces JEAN quietly smug

VIV (CONTD)
That’s my girl

DEBBIE
LAUGHING OK I’m bored

ACE
Hey It’s not over till the fat
lady sings

DEBBIE
I’m the fat lady and I’m calling
it Someone get me another drink

VIV grabs JEAN for a celebratory snog JEAN deftly
overriding her own self-consciousness kisses back There’s
an energy between them which is hard to ignore

ACE
Oh please Get a room

EXT JEAN’S STREET - NIGHT 17

An ordinary street of terraced houses The SOUND of a dog
barking into the nothingness The blinding flash of
HEADLIGHTS JEAN’s car pulling up followed by the ROAR of
VIVs MOTORBIKE

Stepping out of her car JEAN locks eyes with an elderly
WOMAN poking her nose against the window of the next door
house This is ANNE 70s - haughty Somewhat shaken JEAN
heads inside

INT HALLWAY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 18

JEAN picks up a pair of abandoned shoes placing them neatly
on a shoe rack A white tail pokes out from underneath the
sofa JEAN bends down coaxing out PEGGY burying her face in
soft white fur

JEAN
Hey hey It’s OK
(then)
I think your bike really gets to
her you know

VIV
(closing the door)
It’s not my bike it’s that dog
Does it ever stop

JEAN ignores this heading to the kitchen

INT JEAN’S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 19
JEAN sticks an invite for a child’s birthday on the fridge

and sets about making PEGGY’s dinner SAY YOU by COLOURBOX
suddenly blasts through the house

INT JEAN’S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 20

JEAN
(appearing at the door)
Can you turn that down

VIV shushes her handing over a glass of something neat and
brown Swaying to the music she slinks round behind JEAN
pressing up against her back daring her to join in
Eventually JEAN softens reaching an arm round to grab VIV’s
neck moving her hips to the music

VIV
There she is

They stay like this for a moment bound together breathing
each other in A spell only broken by the SOUND of the
TELEPHONE Before JEAN has a chance to decide what to do VIV
reaches over and hangs up the phone

On JEAN unnerved yet thrilled by this transgression

JEAN
Youre bad

VIV
How bad

JEAN
Bad

On VIV smirking suggestively That glint in her eye visibly
thawing Jean

VIV chases JEAN up the stairs growling like a wild animal
They collapse in a heap at the top giggling like teenagers

OMITTED 21

INT JEAN’S BEDROOM - LATER 22

JEAN and VIV post coital Faces close but not touching
Breath shallow and uneven Shockwaves of pleasure pulsating
through their bodies They hold each other like this for a
while kissing each other intermittently JEAN appearing lost
in a peacefulness so big it dazes her

Then out of nowhere she rolls away uneasy with the level
of intimacy

She turns to flick on a cassette player by the bed

VIV
Oh please no Not again

JEAN
I need it

VIV
Youre sick in the head you know
that don’t you

The machine whirs into life

SLEEP AID CASSETTE (0C)
Choose a point out in front of you
and allow your eyes to focus upon
it Now take a deep breath in and
as you let it out allow your eye
lids to close

VIV pretends to suffocate herself with a pillow JEAN laughs

24b

EXT WHITLEY BAY NORTH SHIELDS - DAWN 23

The North Sea as immense as it is black SEAGULLS loom above
the swash circling breakfast An epicene figure appears
jogging along the boardwalk That hair ever distinctive
against the mottled pink sky

At a junction she slows wiping away sweat with the back of
her hand A peeling BILLBOARD reads - “IS THIS LABOUR’S IDEA
OF A COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION” A textbook emblazoned with the
words “YOUNG GAY AND PROUD” -- “TAKE THE POLITICS OUT OF
EDUCATION VOTE CONSERVATIVE” Remnants from the previous
year’s election

JEAN disappears down an alleyway past a row of neglected
back gardens absorbed by the SOUNDS of a city waking up
INT JEAN’S BATHROOM - DAY 24

The bathroom fogged with steam JEAN engulfed by warm water

INT JEAN’S KITCHEN - DAY 24b

In a mint green towelling robe JEAN eats from a bowl of
cereal staring out of the window The neighbour’s DOG is
pissing up against her car leg cocked JEAN observes with a
curiously even-tempered rage ANNE appears at the window
beside an inconspicuous ‘Neighbourhood Watch’ sticker A beat
as they lock eyes

OMITTED 25

EXT SPORTS HALL - DAY 26

Rain hammers down on the roof of the hall gushing in
torrents from neglected guttering

INT SPORTS HALL - DAY 27

Year ten BOYS and GIRLS filter into the hall JEAN stands
near the entrance holding the register MICHELLE is there
too organising equipment

JEAN
Abigail Dawson Mindy Singh

VARIOUS
Here Miss

JEAN
Lois Jackson

Silence JEAN cranes her neck amid titters from the class

JEAN (CONTD)
Anyone know where Lois is

Blank expressions Don’t know Don’t care

JEAN (CONTD)
(making a note)
Right Siobhan

SIOBHAN
Here

JEAN reaches into her pocket and pulls out the newly signed
permission slip handing it to a confused SIOBHAN As she
opens it her mouth twitches Unequivocal pleasure

LOIS appears in the doorway unbrushed tendrils of dark hair
covering half her face Something in her attitude appears a
touch rehearsed But her attempted bravado isn’t enough to
hide the prickling in her cheeks

JEAN
Lois

She nods All eyes on this alien creature Studying

JEAN (CONTD)
Come on in I’m Miss Newman Have
you got your kit yet

LOIS
No

JEAN
Right that’s OK We’ll find you
something Michelle--

LOIS
Can I just watch

SIOBHAN sniggers Two of the BOYS gawp eyes on stalks LOIS
glares back at them

JEAN
Something funny Mike

MIKE
LAUGHING Nah Miss

JEAN
Right then Grow up
(then to LOIS)
OK look You can sit this one out
But in future it’s not really
optional okay

LOIS nods By now the class are all whispering like excitable
bunnies If she’s watching I want to etc

JEAN (CONTD)
Enough Right I need you in two
teams Jimmy get over here

INT SPORTSHALL - NOT LONG LATER 28

BODIES charge across the hall Two kids stand like goalies in
the middle These are the BULLDOGS It’s their job to catch
the others before they reach the other side

Slowly tracking through this mass of bodies we locate LOIS
sitting on a bench keenly observing JEAN as she does her
thing on the sideline beside MICHELLE

MIKE slams into JILL who squeals

MIKE
British Bulldog - one two three

MICHELLE
That’s it Mike

The game continues Screams and yelps of delight and
frustration echoing round the room JEAN turns her attention
to LOIS

JEAN
If you come by the office tomorrow
I’1l sort you out with some kit
alright

She turns back to the game then--

JEAN (CONTD)
Have you thought about joining the
netball team

LOIS shakes her head

JEAN (CONTD)
Were midway through the season but
you could come along later and get
a feel for it if you like

Almost no reaction from LOIS SIOBHAN looks over from across
the hall Sensing competition Then--

JEAN (CONTD)
Have you played before

LOIS
No
(beat)
But I know you can’t run when
youve got the ball

JEAN
(vaguely amused)
I reckon youd be good at it you
know

LOIS considers the offer

LOIS
Thanks but you’re alright

A bell sounds and LOIS stands

JEAN
Let me know if you change your
mind

Half a nod as LOIS heads towards the door JEAN watches her
go Her expression one of genuine empathy

INT JEAN’S LIVING ROOM - LATER 29

JEAN and VIV are eating pot noodles in front of the TV A
couple of half drunk tinnies sit beside a brimming ashtray on
the coffee table

JEAN is a careful eater wrapping each mouthful slowly round
her fork placing it purposefully into her mouth VIV’s the
opposite Noisy Messy Paper towels everywhere After a
particularly loud slurp JEAN turns

VIV
What

JEAN
Nothing

VIV

No really am I distracting you

JEAN
LAUGHS You’re just quite loud

VIV
Oh yeah How loud

JEAN
(playful)
Sounds like you’re snoring

VIV
No it doesn’t
(JEAN shrugs)
Come on Show us what it’s like

JEAN does an impression It’s not flattering

VIV (CONTD)
LAUGHS Wow Okay

JEAN laughing clearly enjoying mocking VIV in this way

CILLA BLACK (0S)
In a moment we’ll find out how Anna
and Kevin enjoyed their blind date
in Denmark and meet the man who
has to choose from one of these
three lovely girls

VIV picks up the remote and flicks over to another channel

JEAN
Hey

VIV
We’re not watching that

JEAN VIV (CONTD)
Why No way

JEAN tries to snatch back the remote back but VIV waves it
round the air just out of reach

VIV (CONTD)
(in a sirup sweet voice)
Oh but Kevin if you fall for me I
promise to suck your cock every
week and never ever ever
emasculate you in front of your
friends

JEAN laughs begrudgingly

VIV (CONTD)
You do realise they flood our
tellies with this ‘ere to distract
us from what’s really going on

JEAN
Always the conspiracy theorist

VIV
I’m telling you

JEAN
Not everything’s political

VIV
Of course it is

A moment between them VIV melting JEAN Then JEAN puts her
pot noodle down and wraps herself around VIV feeling her way
up her back to take off her bra She wrestles with it for a
second smiling awkwardly VIV hoists herself up onto her
knees and takes off her T shirt A moment with them there
breathing each other in

Then -- THE DOORBELL

JEAN
Who’s that

VIV
How would I know

The door goes again

JEAN
Okay hang on

JEAN padding over to the door peering through the peep hole
On the porch are SASHA 30 blonde and wholesome and a little
boy in striped pyjamas SAMMY 5

VIV pulling on her t-shirt as SAMMY bounds up onto the sofa
the mood now shattered

SAMMY leaps onto the sofa grabbing the TV remote

JEAN

JEAN

VIV goes to kiss JEAN but ends up planting a half kiss on
her cheek It’s awkward and both of them feel it

VIV
Enjoy your cartoons

JEAN picks at the wood around the fridge as VIV makes her
way outside It splinters onto the floor

JEAN winces as VIV’s motorbike ROARS into life

33 INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 33
On the sofa SAMMY picks his nose with intense focus

FEMALE CONTESTANT (0S)
Well Jason this date sounds a bit
fishy to me but if you pick me
tonight the only question you’1l
be asking is “Is it your plaice or
mine” nasal canned laughter

SAMMY cocks his head confused

JEAN (0C)
Come on then Sammy Bath time

SAM
It’s not finished

JEAN
I don’t care

SAMMY shakes his head solemnly
JEAN (CONTD)

(switching off the TV)
Come on

SAMMY gets up without a word head hanging

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT 34

SAMMY in the bath now playing solemnly with a toy airplane
JEAN sits next to him on the bathmat PEGGY pawing at the
carpet by her feet

All of a sudden SAMMY starts rocking back and forth with his
entire body sending a tidal wave over the sides of the bath
and onto the carpet

JEAN
Hey Stop that

SAMMY doesn’t listen Huge lapping waves slosh over the
side soaking JEAN scaring off PEGGY

JEAN (CONTD)
Stop it

JEAN jumps to her feet grabbing SAMMY roughly lifting him
clear of the water A beat between them steely stubbornness
on both sides Then JEAN softens checking herself

JEAN (CONTD)
Hey it’s okay
(she hugs him tight)
Let’s go read a story

SAMMY lets his body go floppy dropping the plane which PLOPS
into the bath with a splash

Sitting him down on the toilet seat JEAN dries SAMMY’s hair
with a towel and helps him with his pyjamas

JEAN (CONTD)
(gentle with feeling)
I’m sorry Sammy I should’na yelled
at ya

SAMMY doesn’t respond

watches from the window as she dismounts

INT JEAN’S HALLWAY - DAY 39

JEAN opens her front door revealing VIV

VIV
Hi

JEAN
Hi

JEAN takes a drag of her cigarette VIV peers into the house

JEAN (CONTD)
What

VIV
Just checking you’re not on nanny
duty today

JEAN
Sasha picked him up this morning

There is a slackening as they stand there looking at each
other A fondness returning An unspoken apology

INT CHIPPY - DAY 40

JEAN and VIV sit opposite each other hungrily devouring a
plate of chips It’s quiet in here They are the only
customers The OWNER sits on a table not far away smoking a
cigarette Music from the radio transitions into a news
bulletin

NEWS REPORTER (0C)
A gay teacher was suspended in
Bradford City Centre today
(MORE)

NEWS REPORTER (0C) (CONTD)
Dr Austin Allen 37 who teaches
Maths at a secondary school in
Bradford West Yorkshire was
accused by the city council of an
“error of judgement” following an
earlier warning that he should not
discuss his own sexuality or
homosexuality in general at school

VIV coughs almost choking on a chip She takes a swig of
coke to wash it down

NEWS REPORTER
This news follows an earlier
announcement that the government is
to ban the promotion of
homosexuality in schools CLAUSE 28
will make it illegal for schools
and local councils to promote
homosexuality and pretended family
relationships

VIV
What does that even mean
“pretended family relationships”

Despite her outrage VIV keeps her voice to a level only JEAN
can hear JEAN wipes her mouth with a napkin slowly
deliberately

JEAN

I found myself lying the other day
I had to call one of the kid’s
parents And I got I dunno-

(a beat then)
I told her I was me boss

(beat)
I didn’t plan it or anything But I
felt like if I told her it was me
she might think--

VIV
Something was going on between yous
two
JEAN
Yeah It’s stupid
VIV
It’s not stupid

(then)
It’s what they want though You
know that

A bell rings as ANNE enters the chippy A sudden energy
shift ANNE’s eyes travel to VIV Her tattooed hands Her
clothes The OWNER stands

OWNER
What can I get you love

JEAN watching ANNE watching VIV Clocking this little
Mexican standoff VIV waves emphatically back at ANNE then
turns back to JEAN

VIV
She’s friendly

The colour rises in JEAN’s cheeks She reaches for her
wallet pulls out some coins to cover the chips

VIV (CONTD)
What are you doing I haven’t
finished
JEAN tosses them onto her napkin and heads towards the exit

VIV is left standing by the table as JEAN stride away down
the pavement

INT JEAN’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 42

JEAN sits alone on her sofa smoking a cigarette barely
illuminated The TV is on

MET POLICE OFFICER (0C)
I obviously don’t want children
taught that the gay and lesbian
lifestyle is natural or normal
It’s not It never has been And it
never will be

Music builds as we slowly begin to track in on JEAN’s face
frozen in a sort of stare

CHURCH OF ENGLAND PRIEST (0C)
I hesitate to use the word
perversion But let’s face up to
the truth of this situation that’s
what it is

CUT directly off JEAN’s stare to--

INT SPORTS HALL - DREAMSCAPE 43

LOIS Doubled over in the centre of the hall wearing a look
of absolute determination Opposite her - a pack of crazed
TEENAGERS poised to take down their prey

That music building here still--

JEAN raises a whistle to her lips and LOIS propels herself
forward Darting this way and that one hand on the ground to
spin out of a near miss Eventually the wolves descend
Scrabbling over each other Spitting and SNARLING All eager
to be the one to make the kill

LOIS’s torso smashes against the wooden floor and she looks
up at JEAN a helpless child now JEAN reaches down a hand to
pull her up as the rest of the kids high five each other

JEAN
You made that look easy

JEAN smiles encouragingly but LOIS unused to this kind of
flattery tries desperately to hide her flushing cheeks

SIOBHAN watches this exchange through gritted teeth

Panting and puce the year tens leave the hall

JEAN looking very pale as VIV clips a motorcycle helmet under
her chin VIV laughs and pulls down the visor

VIV
You’re not backing out now

VIV throws her leg over the bike JEAN’s fingers grip onto
VIV as the engine fires up VIV grins and kicks the throttle

EXT COAST ROAD - DUSK 46

The bike pelts up the coast road VIV turns to look over her
shoulder

VIV
(muffled)
You okay back there

A hint of a smile from JEAN Then--

JEAN
Look at the road

VIV laughs turning back to face the front Then she reaches
down and squeezes JEAN’s hand

EXT DIRT TRACK - DUSK 47

The motorcycle headlight clicks on illuminating the
hedgerow Their pace a little slower now as VIV navigates a
bumpy track

JEAN tilts her head back closing her eyes allowing herself
to enjoy the sensation of the wind on her face VIV smiles as
she watches JEAN in the side mirror

The bike skids to a halt on the edge of the dunes and JEAN
leaps off helmet still on charging towards the sea

VIV
LAUGHING Wait for me

VIV sprints across the sand no match for JEAN

A lone DOG WALKER turns smiling as these two unidentifiable
lovers kick off their shoes frolicking in the sand

FADE TO BLACK

INT VENUS - A FEW DAYS LATER 48

The bar is alive with the heady energy of women on the pull
ACE DEBBIE and VIV are consumed in animated conversation
with JONI 30s JEAN hands out badly pulled pints of Slalom

Rapturous laughter from the group

JONI
Poor sod

VIV
LAUGHS Aw you’re such a cow

JONI winks provocatively at VIV JEAN cautiously observing

ACE
Oh my god Stop This one “Gay
white female is lusting for sweaty
butch athletes pumped for
bristling bodybuilders and
handsome hot women in uniform to
quell the ache in my loins and
soften my perpetually erect clit”

The whole table bursts into hysterics

VIV
Who the fuck has a perpetually
erect clit

JONI
You do I seem to remember

A loaded beat All eyes on JEAN
VIV
(to JONT)
Really--

JONI flashes an unapologetic smile JEAN looks from JONI to
VIV unsure what to do with this information

DEBBIE JONI
Read another one babe Oh come on We all fucked
each other That’s what we
did
ACE

Speak for yourself
VIV turns to JEAN tries to take her hand JEAN pulls away

JONI
What you’ve lost your memory now
youre married is that it

They continue bickering but JEAN gets up VIV makes to
follow but DEBBIE raises her hand

DEBBIE
Maybe leave her for a minute

On VIV unsure whether to follow

VIV
(to JONT)
What the fuck was that

JONI
I didn’t know we had to watch
language round the teacher

VIV
Her name’s Jean And if you can’t
be nice why don’t you just piss
off

VIV glances over to the bar where JEAN takes a seat
embroiled in a cloud of cigarette smoke

50b

AT THE BAR -- JEAN scans the dance floor A mass of writhing
sweaty bodies The DJ changes track Brit-funk classic
MELODIES OF LOVE The dancers switch up a gear Her eyes fall
on a pair of lovers entwined in a passionate embrace Taking
a long drag of her cigarette she contemplates their
uninhibited sexuality

Turning back she tries unsuccessfully to grab the BARTENDER
Beaten to it by a familiar face one that takes a moment to
place here out of context

It’s LOIS paying for a beer She’s alone wide-eyed and way
out of her depth

BARTENDER (0C)
What can I get you

JEAN blinking in a numbed daze doesn’t respond Blood

pounds in her ears Slipping off her chair she disappears
into the crowd

INT VENUS BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 49

JEAN on the toilet now head hanging The SOUND of her pee
hitting the bowl She looks up slowly studying the various
obscenities adorning the walls Things like - “Lesbians are
fucking everywhere” and “Resisting the shame regime”

Someone BANGS on the door

INT BATHROOM - LATER 50

JEAN scrubbing her hands in the sink like she’s trying to
remove a layer of skin LOIS appears in the reflection
smiling hesitantly An uneasy stillness descends as they lock
eyes But then without a flicker of acknowledgement JEAN
moves to the dryer drys her hands and leaves the bathroom

On LOIS confused and wounded A group of WOMEN bustle into
the toilets shoving her as they go

INT VENUS STAIRCASE - NOT LONG LATER 50b
VIV approaches JEAN at the bottom of the stairs

VIV
You OK

JEAN
I think I’m gonna go home

A beat

VIV
Home

JEAN
Yeah sorry

VIV
Because of her

JEAN
No

VIV

She likes to shock people That’s
just what she does

(then)
Don’t you think you’re over-
reacting a little bit

JEAN
It’s nothing to do with her I just
want to go home

VIV

Okay I’1l come with you
JEAN

No stay
VIV

No let’s go

JEAN
I think I just want to be alone

VIV
Fine whatever

VIV annoyed heads through the double doors back into the

bar

INT JEAN’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

JEAN sits in a tight upright position beside an overflowing
ashtray The phone rings but she ignores it The rumble of a
car pulling up outside headlights penetrating her space

She rises to shut the curtains putting her water glass down
on a table as she goes She stands there very still the
tectonic plates beneath her beginning to tremble Eventually
the car pulls away

INTEXT JEAN’S CAR - THE NEXT DAY 53
JEAN sits in her car outside nondescript grey buildings

THWACK A knock on her window A kid on a skateboard whizzing
by late for assembly JEAN’s entire body jolts

INT SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY 54

Malevolent LAUGHTER lingers in JEAN’s ears as she walks She
seems somewhat feverish Teachers pass smiling good-
naturedly but in JEAN’s heightened POV they appear somehow
threatening An unsettling prop for the school production is
wheeled across her path

OMITTED 55

INT SPORTS HALL - LATER 56

JEAN alone on court placing coloured cones in a line The
SOUND of the door opening She turns the hairs on the back
of her neck going up It’s LOIS

An interminable moment Wild animals sizing each other up
LOIS’s expression though unwavering in its stoicism betrays

the faintest hint of hope Hope that she might be included
This hint of vulnerability cuts through JEAN

JEAN

Changed your mind then
LOIS

Maybe
JEAN

Okay Well I’1ll have you shadow
Siobhan today help you get to
grips with the basics

LOIS nods The rest of the team flood into the hall eyeing
her curiously put out down right annoyed in some cases

JEAN (CONTD)
(then to LOIS)
Take that jumper off please
Uniform only on this team

LOIS pulls off her jumper and jogs over towards the others

INT SPORTS HALL - NOT LONG LATER 57

TWO GIRLS poised at the centre JEAN blows a whistle and the
ball descends A match ensues for a few moments until CAROL
catches the ball and LOIS bats it easily out of her hands

JEAN blows her whistle this time barely audible above a
cacophony of voices The class are in UPROAR Throwing blame
around like a hot coal

JEAN
That’s enough We do not speak to
each other like that on this court
Now which one of you is going to
show Lois how we defend without
contact

A sea of reluctant faces

JEAN (CONTD)
Siobhan Mindy come here

SIOBHAN furious shuffles over

LOIS retreats towards the bench hands in pockets tuning out
JEAN’s voice Prickling she focuses her attention on the
physicality of the scene-- watching as JEAN like a master
sculptor sets about creating perfect lines with the players
bodies

JEAN places her hands on SIOBHAN’s hips -- The curve of
SIOBHAN’s lower back -- Her tilted pelvis -- That mane
grazing the nape of her neck

A WHISTLE breaks the spell

SIOBHAN keen to prove a point easily dodges past MINDY
throwing the ball out of play

JEAN (CONTD)
Okay Well done Lois Want to give
it a try

LOIS hesitates she wasn’t listening

JEAN (CONTD)
It’s OK We’ll go slowly

Not ready to concede LOIS jogs over

It’s LOIS vs SIOBHAN A palpable uneasy tension between
them The ball drops but it’s all over very quickly SIOBHAN
dodging easily to the side throwing the ball to MINDY and
sprinting past LOIS is frustrated and it shows

JEAN (CONTD)
Give it another go come stand
here If you position yourself more
like this

JEAN hesitates as she reaches out to position LOIS’s body
Then checks herself for hesitating A fizzy three-way
energy JEAN’s hands on LOIS’s shoulders LOIS’s eyes on
JEAN’s hand SIOBHAN’s eyes trained on JEAN as she encourages
LOIS Every look every movement loaded with an
uncomfortable unbridled intimacy

JEAN drops the ball SIOBHAN snatches it but this time LOIS
defends with every cell of her body SIOBHAN turns left BAM -
she’s there -- right BAM - she’s there

Eventually SIOBHAN prevails passing to MINDY whom she high
fives victorious But LOIS’s performance is enough to renew
her confidence SIOBHAN throws LOIS a territorial glance A
war is brewing here

A BELL GOES in the distance JEAN collects the bibs calling
out instructions about their upcoming match

LOIS hands her bib back looking up at JEAN with those big
hopeful blue eyes JEAN battles her instinct

JEAN (CONTD)
See you back here tomorrow then
INT PE DEPARTMENT OFFICES - DAY 58

On JEAN experiencing some kind of brain freeze

VIV (0C) (CONTD)
Hello-- Jean--

JEAN flushing looks around the office her hand over the
receiver DAVE isn’t far away sipping coffee by the
photocopier Without giving anything away JEAN reaches over
and hangs up the phone DEAD TONE

With one last sheepish look around she resumes her work

PAULA appears behind JEAN tensing awaits the Spanish
inquisition BUT--

PAULA

approved the proposals you put

JEAN steps cautiously into an epic co-opted space ACE is
lying across DEBBIE on a sofa on the far side of the room
They don’t notice JEAN come in
Something simmers on a camping stove nearby
awkwardly far from home in this space

ABI late 20s appears from behind a screen

ABI
Oh hiya

JEAN

VIV appears at a door to the left ABI grins before
registering the animosity blistering between them

And she disappears back behind a screen
VIV studies JEAN waiting for an explanation

JEAN
(lowering her voice)
You can’t call me at work I told
you that

VIV
You didn’t call me back last night
I was worried

JEAN
I told you not to call me there

VIV

(hesitating)
Er no I’m fine

VIV
Okay great

VIV kisses JEAN and she kisses back

VIV (CONTD)
I called you uptight You’re not

Well maybe a little

They laugh and JEAN kisses VIV with more urgency hoping sex
might provide some respite from the muddled chaos of her
mind VIV slowly unravels JEAN’s towel kissing her ribs and
caressing her thighs finally disappearing between her legs

For a second JEAN’s there in the moment breath quickening
back arched Then her mind wanders to the SOUND of ABI
laughing and clattering around on the other side of the door
Every muscle in JEAN’s body stiffens

On JEAN trying desperately to detach But the gap between
pleasure and anxiety only seems to expand Eventually she
grabs VIV gently guiding her up till their faces meet

VIV (CONTD)
What’s--

JEAN

They lie on their backs for a moment breathing heavily VIV
hurt looks to JEAN for an answer JEAN doesn’t have one

The steady thrum of an ancient storage heater A LARGE BROWN
MOTH flutters half heartedly trapped in the lamp

JEAN sits alone in a wide open frame reading the back cover
of a weatherbeaten copy of THE WELL OF LONELINESS picking at
a bowl of pasta

A yellow NEWSPAPER CLIPPING falls into her lap as she turns
the page Wiping away sauce from her mouth she unfolds it to
reveal an ancient review Some words have been highlighted
“I would rather give a healthy boy or girl a phial of prussic
acid than give them this novel

JEAN starts as ABI enters wearing nothing but a pair of
mangey boxer shorts

ABI
Sorry did I frighten ya

JEAN’s colleagues are huddled round the TV JEAN moves
through to get a better look--

TV NEWS REPORTER (0C)
Three women gay rights protesters
caused pandemonium in the House of
Lords last night when they abseiled
from the public gallery onto the
floor of the chamber The women
were protesting CLAUSE 28 which
bans schools and local councils
from promoting or normalising
homosexuality and pretended family
relationships

Another voice now--

LORDS PEER (0C)
We on this side of the committee
care first and foremost about
children

Echoes of agreement
STILL as a HUNTED DEER JEAN registers no reaction
LORDS PEER (CONTD)
We care about the perpetuation of
the heterosexual normal family as
the basis of civilised society here

and in other countries

JEAN still rooted to the spot others gossiping around her

between these walls She takes a breath Then reaches a hand
between her legs pulling it out to reveal a thick globule of
blood clinging to her fingers She groans reaching for the
toilet roll accidentally smearing blood across the
dispenser sending it into a spin

Reams of white paper mounting on the floor Bloody finger
prints Leaving tracks

Sniggers from the rabble LOIS tries to stay calm

Hostile laughter from SIOBHAN’s steadily building entourage

button

clock ticks overhead With a gauze between her teeth JEAN
rolls down LOIS’s sock

JEAN
You’ve a chance to really succeed
on this team

JEAN applies antiseptic to a gash in LOIS’s knee She barely
flinches

LOIS
D’you even care what happened

An olive branch JEAN considers it But--

JEAN
Just ignore them

LOIS
LAUGHS Is that what you did

On JEAN her jaw pulsating She bites off a piece of surgical
tape between her teeth

JEAN
I’m not talking about me

LOIS daring JEAN to engage A dull violence in her eyes A
beat eyes locked Something is tempting JEAN to share with
this girl She checks herself

JEAN (CONTD)
I think you need to be careful is
what I’m saying If it comes to it
your word against hers you know
who they’1ll believe don’t you

LOIS
LAUGHING So it doesn’t even
matter what happened

JEAN
Look I could get you thrown out
permanently for that kind of
behaviour I know it seems unfair
but I am trying to help you If you
want this fight for it Not
against it

But LOIS is distracted by something else It’s SIOBHAN poking

her nose up against the glass craning to see LOIS flips her
a finger

JEAN (CONTD)
Hey Hey

MICHELLE barrels into the office SIOBHAN no longer anywhere
to be seen A beat as she takes in the scene The air THICK
with things unsaid Then clocking the first aid kit--

MICHELLE
Oh no what happened

LOIS looks expectantly at JEAN waiting to see how she’s
going to handle this

JEAN
Just a graze

MICHELLE
Aw you alright pet

LOIS

LOIS locks eyes with JEAN on her way out

him SASHA arranges a limp nut roast with her perfectly
manicured fingers

SASHA

SASHA and JEAN share a conspiratorial smile as TIM puts a

plate down in front of SAMMY which he promptly bats onto the
floor

TIM (CONTD) SASHA
That’s enough Sam Sammy

TIM is up like a shot Hauling a terrified SAMMY out of his
chair

SASHA and JEAN sit on opposite sides of the table smiling
awkwardly as TIM scolds SAMMY audibly next door

serving herself

A cosy den surrounded by fluffy animals SAMMY snuggles up
to JEAN as she reads

JEAN
“Who are you” Said the
Caterpillar -- This was not an

encouraging opening for a
conversation Alice replied rather
shyly “I — I hardly know sir
just at present — at least I know
who I WAS when I got up this
morning but I think I must have
been changed several times since
then”

JEAN inhales an imaginary pipe SAMMY smiles up at her

TIM appears at the edge of the den watching for a moment
Something about the cosiness of this set up irks him

TIM
Come on Sammy let’s go and play
outside

SAMMY
But-—

TIM

Youve been inside all day
SAMMY pulls an angry face

TIM (CONTD)
I’m going to count to three
One Two

gets to her feet slowly weighed down by insidious family
dynamics

the garden JEAN stands with her back to us by a fireplace
smoking a cigarette

SASHA (0C)
Can I show you something quickly
while they’re out there I bought
something for Tim for our
anniversary and I really need a
second opinion--

JEAN
I thought I asked you to get rid of
this

She plucks a silver frame from a crowded mantelpiece In it
a YOUNG JEAN beams up at us barely recognisable in a lacy
bridal gown Her hair darker longer

SASHA
(guiltily)
I love that one

A loaded look between sisters

SASHA (CONTD)
You look so happy I know I
know

JEAN
Please

SASHA
I don’t have any recent ones And I
miss your hair like that

JEAN
You sound like Mam

JEAN

I don’t like seeing it there
(then)

What

SASHA
I don’t know Well it’s just --
It’s not as if everything that came
before -- you know is a lie

JEAN

What are you talking about

SASHA

I don’t think it’s right that you
want to erase part of your life
That you expect us to

JEAN
I thought I just asked you to
replace one photograph

SASHA
You know what I mean

JEAN
I don’t actually

SASHA
Youre trying to erase your
marriage

JEAN
Am I now

SASHA
Don’t be a child

A prolonged look between them They’re regressing into an age
old pattern here and they can both feel it Then--

Why didn’t you tell me you weren’t
alone the other night

dropped him off

SASHA
Okay But d’you see-- It’s hard
for me to -- well to trust you

On JEAN digesting sinuous subtext

SASHA (CONTD)
So Come on who is she then

JEAN takes a drag of her cigarette cringing throwing SASHA
a look that says “drop it”

As if on cue SAMMY bursts through the door SQUEALING TIM
in hot pursuit growling like a grizzly bear The epitome of
“HANDS ON DAD”

So joyous is he playing with his son we almost forget what
came before He comes for JEAN who plays along but her
heart’s not in it

INT JEAN’S CAR - MOVING - DAY 80
JEAN drives away past a row of immaculate houses with
perfectly manicured lawns In the rearview she watches as
the whole family wave her off A fifties family portrait
The SOUND of feet thudding on tarmac melts through the
transition

EXT STREET - DUSK 81
JEAN sprints past the illuminated windows and neon fish and

chip signs of Whitley Bay barely looking as she crosses a
the road Screeching TYRES Angry HORNS

INT VENUS - A FEW NIGHTS LATER 82

JEAN jogs down the stairs into the bar At the bottom she
surveys the scene--

ACE is with VIV at the bar handing over money for a round of
drinks They haven’t seen JEAN yet Next to the pool table
LOIS chats to DEBBIE with another girl AIMEE 21 JEAN
visibly tightens the muscle in her cheek beginning to spasm
But VIV has now spotted her and is waving her over

LOIS’s eyes flick up briefly acknowledging JEAN She appears
to have grown in confidence since her last visit

VIV
(kissing JEAN)
Hey
JEAN
Hi
VIV

(handing JEAN a beer)
What’s wrong You look stressed

JEAN
Thanks

VIV
LAUGHS Here

She passes JEAN a cigarette and lights it

LOIS eyes JEAN curiously the music is too loud for her to
hear what she’s saying

VIV (CONTD)
What’s going on

JEAN
Nothing
(then)
Just work

VIV

That bad is it
(beat)

Maybe we should go away The girls
and I were actually talking about
taking a trip down to Hebden
Bridge They do this women’s disco
once a month

On JEAN still distracted

VIV (CONTD)
Is that a no is it

JEAN
No I’m just--

ACE appears

ACE
Hey lady

JEAN
Hiya

ACE gives JEAN a sort of half embrace

ACE
Wow you seem tense

VIV
That’s what I said

DEBBIE
Leave her alone you lot

Behind them LOIS picks up a cue and fires a shot easily
potting a ball

ACE
(laughing)
The kid’s good

LOIS smiles modestly appearing taller every second

ACE (CONTD)
Wanna play Jean here is unbeaten
(then)
You can be on my team

LOIS
I dunno

ACE
Nah come on It’ll be fun

VIV laughs oblivious to the fizzing energy between LOIS and
JEAN

JEAN
I don’t really--

ACE
Ahh - she can’t take the heat

On LOIS now unsure what to make of the situation as ACE
hands a cue to JEAN They lock eyes for a moment

CUT TO--
SNAPSHOTS OF A POOL GAME IN FULL SWING

SHE CAN’T LOVE YOU by CHEMISE blasts through the speakers A
strobe light does it’s thing For a while it’s close LOIS
pots a ball the others cheer Then JEAN pots one in its
place And so on

Then there are only a couple of balls left on the table JEAN
lines up her shot cautiously eyeing LOIS who is sharing a
cigarette with AIMEE ACE and DEBBIE dance raucously by the
side of the table

A steely look on JEAN’s face She takes her aim -- but misses
and pots the white

VIV
Oh no It’s all over

JEAN registers no emotion handing the cue to LOIS who
appears suddenly cautious as if the teacher student dynamic
has suddenly realigned She pauses for a moment before
passing the cue to ACE

LOIS
You can take it

ACE
No way Finish her off

LOIS eyes JEAN uncertainly But the others cheer her on and
she’s forced to take her shot easily potting her final ball
and then the black

Fists drum the side of the pool table amid cheers from the
others LOIS doesn’t join in instead she sets down her cue
and makes a pointed exit towards the toilet

Placing a cigarette in her mouth JEAN fishes around for a
lighter FLICK FLICK FLICK -- nothing JEAN places it
purposefully on the bar all the while watching LOIS as she
disappears into the bathroom

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT 83

LOIS enters a toilet cubicle turning to shut the door But
JEAN’s behind her grabbing the door forcing her way in and
locking it behind them

LOIS
Hey

LOIS looking at JEAN like she’s lost the plot

LOIS (CONTD)
What are you doing

JEAN
You need to leave

LOIS
Why

JEAN
You know why
(beat)
You can do whatever you want
wherever you want But not here
OK

Beat

LOIS
Why do you care so much

JEANs jaw pulsates
JEAN

Youre fifteen You shouldn’t even
be in here

LOIS
So what
(then)
I haven’t told anyone have I

OUTSIDE - a WOMAN bangs loudly on the door

WOMAN
Some of us are bursting out here

VIV appears at the back of the queue
Back INSIDE - a held look between JEAN and LOIS

JEAN
SOTTO Go Otherwise you’re off
the team

LOIS
What

JEAN opens the door revealing a queue of WOMEN waiting to
use the toilets

VIV’s there Frozen in disbelief She looks from JEAN to
LOIS waiting for something Then she turns storming back
into the bar JEAN follows pushing past the queue of women
chasing VIV out of the bathroom and up the stairs

OMITTED 84

EXT VENUS FIRE EXIT - NIGHT 85

JEAN out of breath now catches up with VIV on the street

VIV
Just tell us what you were doing in
there so I know

JEAN
She’s one of me students She’s
on the team

A beat as VIV processes this

VIV
What -- Are you --

JEAN
No Of course not

VIV
Then why didn’t you say something

JEAN
I don’t know

VIV
Youre lying

JEAN
I’m not - look it’s complicated

VIV waiting for more information

JEAN (CONTD)
I was asking her to leave

VIV
In the toilet

JEAN nods

VIV (CONTD)
Why
(beat)
Why were you asking her to leave

JEAN
I don’t want my students knowing
every part of me life

VIV
Every part of your life

JEAN
Yeah

VIV doesn’t believe her

JEAN (CONTD)
I don’t know what you want me to
say

A long beat

JEAN (CONTD)
You have to create boundaries as a
teacher It’s part of the job If
anyone finds out I’1l1 never work
again

VIV
That’s quite a stretch don’t you
think

JEAN
No It isn’t

VIV
(after a beat)
And what about her

JEAN
Who
VIV
That girl How old is she What
Sixteen
JEAN
Fifteen
VIV

What kind of example are you
setting for her

Beat

JEAN
That’s not fair

VIV
None of this is fair

JEAN
Just because I don’t parade my
sexuality around like a badge of
honour

VIV
Oh and I do is that it
(beat)
How is that girl ever going to
learn she has a place in this
world if you of all people tell
her that she doesn’t

JEAN
What makes you think she has a
place in this world
The words tumble from her mouth before she can stop them

VIV shaking her head slowly beginning to understand Then--

VIV
I can’t do this

JEAN
Wait Viv Please

JEAN desperately reaching

VIV
No Get off

And she’s gone JEAN left alone on the pavement trapped in
time

INT JEAN’S CAR - NIGHT 86

JEAN driving numb The radio plays loud classical music She
lights a cigarette with the car lighter filling her drunken
lungs with that much needed hit The lights up ahead MELT
into each another That familiar rocking motion setting in
JEAN’s steering becomes erratic TYRES SCREECH

CUT ABRUPTLY TO

TICK-TOCK TICK-TOCK Hazard lights bleep The Renault parked
in a lay-by Cars whizzing by

JEAN knelt in the undergrowth puking her guts out That
music drifting out into the freezing night air

INT JEAN’S BEDROOM - LATER 88

JEAN in bed wide awake Light from a nearby streetlight
throws geometric shadows on her face through net curtains

She reaches over and switches on the SLEEP AID But the sound
is jumbled Like a voice exposed to helium She rewinds
Presses play again Same issue Wrenching herself up she
opens the machine Inside the tape is completely fucked
Sinewy ribbons flooding out into her hands

The SOUND of an ALARM CLOCK fused into that OLD SCHOOL BELL

Night time seamlessly rolling into morning in one
hallucinatory blur

EXT INT PE DEPTARTMENT OFFICE - DAY

JEAN as the coffee machine does its thing

At her desk JEAN reaches for her ruler and begins measuring

out a table with a blue pencil Precise perfect lines
intersecting STAFF MEMBERS chat by the coffee machine
looks around cautiously

The click of the door PAULA entering OC

PAULA
Got a sec

JEAN
Mhmm

PAULA looks around to make sure they’re alone

PAULA
Just one of the kids playing a
prank I’m sure But I found
something on your desk this morning
when I got in

PAULA produces a copy of a GAY NEWS magazine placing it
JEANs desk JEAN takes it in her expression immutable

PAULA (CONTD)
Obviously with everything that’s
going on I didn’t want anyone else
to see it But I thought you should
know

JEAN
Thanks

PAULA
Do you have any idea who might have
put it there

JEAN
I’ve a few ideas

PAULA sensing JEAN’s prickly energy--
PAULA
Don’t look so worried I’ve had far

worse in my time

JEAN musters a half smile

JEAN

EXT SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY 91

STUDENTS mill around the place in groups slurping juice
boxes and munching digestives JEAN looking beat en route to
her next class with MICHELLE

MICHELLE
Simon wants The Beach Boys Could
you think of anything less
romantic He spent one summer in
California now he thinks he’s
fucking James Dean

The BELL goes and the masses disperse LOIS waits with MINDY
outside a classroom

MICHELLE (CONTD)
I don’t even want a first dance I
reckon most people just do it for
the photos

JEAN allows herself a single beat to look over LOIS gives
nothing away catching JEAN’s eye for a micro-second

MICHELLE (CONTD)
(as if underwater)
Simon said we shouldn’t have one at
all if it’s going to stress me out
But I’d never hear the end of it
from me Mam

MICHELLE looks to JEAN for some kind of acknowledgement When
she doesn’t get one she tuts good-naturedly

MICHELLE (CONTD)
Everything alright hun

JEAN
Sorry can you one sec--

JEAN paces down the corridor marching up to LOIS

JEAN (CONTD)
I need to talk to you for a sec

On LOIS uncertain The class taking their places inside
MINDY heads into the classroom and the door swings shut

LOIS
Let me guess I’m off the team

JEAN
No Look I need this to stop

LOIS
What
JEAN
All of it It’s not a game okay
Lois It’s my job My life

LOIS looking up at JEAN almost daring her to explode

LOIS
What is it that you think I’ve
done

JEAN

You know exactly

A beat on JEAN just about holding her rage

LOIS

Are you married or something
JEAN

You think you’re so brave don’t

you
Something snaps in LOIS Her physicality morphing into
something bolder before our eyes Then in a tone that deftly
flattens JEAN’s childish accusation--

LOIS
You don’t know anything about me

She turns disappearing into the classroom

A TEACHER wearing a lab coat stands a few metres away
staring at JEAN He gathers himself and continues walking

On JEAN knowing she’s crossed a line here

MRS LEA (0C)
Good of you to join us Lois
Perhaps you’d like to tell us how
many elements make up the Periodic

LOIS pulls out her chair roughly

SIOBHAN
SOTTO What did she want

LOIS
She’s got a massive crush on me and
she won’t drop it

LOIS visibly gaining power here SIOBHAN put back in her
place unsure where to take this

MRS LEA
Have you got something you’d like
to share with the class Lois

LOIS
No Miss

INT SCHOOL DINING ROOM - LATER 93

JEAN sits alone pushing food around her plate DAVE and some
other teachers are gossiping on the next door table JEAN
turns to focus on the trees outside

From behind the titters escalate into something more
threatening JEAN’s pulse sounds louder and louder in her
ears -- until finally she turns

A group of staff are indeed gossiping exchanging hushed
titbits and conspiratorial glances But it has nothing to do
with JEAN Outside in the playground LOIS is standing
alone with a bag of netballs Her aim isn’t perfect but she
wears a look of absolute determination

JEAN gets up and leaves the room leaving her half eaten
lunch on the table Curious heads turn

INT CHANGING ROOM - DAY 94

JEAN wearily enters the changing room not a trace of her
usual vigour The last slacker races to tie up her shoelace
She doesn’t bother hurrying her instead bending down to
pick up a pair of abandoned socks from the floor She looks
at the name-tape LOIS JACKSON Of course

Then the SOUND of a shower turning on GIRLISH SHRIEKS

JEAN frowns and checks her watch her footsteps unusually
loud as she makes her way towards the showers A strip light
FIZZES above her head

She stops dead just shy of the end of the corridor peering
in SIOBHAN and JILL fighting over the shower nozzle
giggling and squealing spraying each other in the face
Their naked backs immediately visible

There’s nothing unusual or sexual about it but JEAN steps

back hyper-aware of her implied position as voyeur The
tussle continues as she tiptoes out into the corridor

OMITTED 95

INT JEAN’S BATHROOM - NIGHT 96
JEAN’s face distorted beneath the surface of the bath
Breath held Perfectly still Lifeless In the distance a
flurry of adolescent voices swell and merge into one
irrepressible HUM JEAN wrenches her head through the surface
of the water gasping for breath

INT SPORTS HALL - DAY 97

JEAN stands with her clipboard taking the register Swarms of
U16 players filtering in around her

Then PAULA enters
PAULA
Thought I might sit in on practice
today If you don’t mind
JEAN absorbs this What it might mean

JEAN
Of course

PAULA nods smiling in a vaguely threatening kind of way

Quick cuts as JEAN gathers herself and rallies the group into
their warm up

First the group sprints up and down the court

Then a goal shooting exercise

All the while JEAN glancing intermittently towards PAULA but
her face betrays no emotion

After the warm up it’s time for a game

JEAN watches as the U16’s snatch bibs from a pile on the
floor LOIS picks up GA pulling it over her head

PAULA
What’s your line up for the game
against Marden Bridge

But JEAN’s focus is taken by something unravelling behind
PAULA SIOBHAN appears to be in some kind of altercation with
LOIS

LOIS
I got it first
SIOBHAN
It’s my position Miss
JEAN
What
SIOBHAN

She took my bib

JEAN
You’1l1 have to sub in for each
other at half time

SIOBHAN
But it’s my position

JEAN
It’s just practice Siobhan

SIOBHAN
Give it back

LOIS
Piss off

SIOBHAN grabbing at the bib trying to physically remove it
from LOIS JEAN takes a beat deciding how to handle this
but PAULA gets in there first blowing her whistle

PAULA
Enough Both of you on the bench
now

SIOBHAN LOIS
But But--

PAULA
(to LOIS)
You answer back to me and you’re
off the team Okay

LOIS
Me What about her

PAULA
Both of you on the bench Now

LOIS looks to JEAN for support but JEAN turns away blowing
her whistle to start the game

LOIS and SIOBHAN begrudgingly take their seats on opposite
ends of the bench They sit there for a while brooding as
the game begins then LOIS gets up and heads for the showers

OMITTED 98

INT SHOWERS - CONTINUOUS 99

LOIS hot and pissed off stands under the shower in her
swimming costume letting the water consume her For a moment
it’s just her and the water But then a hand on her
shoulder LOIS starts It’s SIOBHAN

LOIS
What are you doing

But SIOBHAN doesn’t respond instead pressing her torso
against LOIS who looks back completely bewildered

The shower clicks off and SIOBHAN edges closer her lips a
whisker away from LOIS now

SIOBHAN
It’s OK

SIOBHAN reaches down softly taking LOIS’s bitten fingers in
hers LOIS moves away just a fraction her eyes darting down
the corridor

SIOBHAN moves LOIS’s hand to her shoulder pulling out her
scrunchy with her other hand That hair flicking down around
her neck brushing against LOIS’s face whipping her into a
frenzy

101b

SILENCE now The usual cacophony of high-pitched voices
somewhat muted
LOIS breath shallow KNOWING this is a trap Knowing it’s
not what it seems But perhaps the same part of her wants it
Spellbound by this possible transgression
She inches a fraction closer looking briefly to SIOBHAN for
approval When she doesn’t flinch LOIS closes her eyes

Helpless A netted bird caught by desire

Their lips touch properly this time LOIS inhaling SIOBHAN
SIOBHAN kissing back TONGUE on TONGUE

JEAN walking down the damp corridor from this perspective
the showers appear empty

Then she sees it just for a second -- SIOBHAN and LOIS
partially obscured clamped together devouring each other
with intense fervour

Then SIOBHAN leaping away from LOIS A high pitch scream
engulfs the shower area LOIS’s face contorts with horror
JEAN stands there frozen head spinning

OMITTED 101

INT CHANGING ROOMS - CONTINUOUS 101b

PAULA runs in followed by a gaggle of other girls

PAULA
What’s going on

SIOBHAN now in a towel runs to squat in the corner of the
room real tears forming JEAN’s face taut and pale CAROL
and JILL rushing in to tend to SIOBHAN with a towel on the
floor

PAULA (CONTD)
(throwing a towel to LOIS)
Can someone tell me what’s going on
please Jean

JEAN struggles to form words

PAULA (CONTD)
Did you see what happened

JEAN

SIOBHAN
(quietly)
She attacked me
PAULA
What do you mean she attacked you

(then)
LOUD Can someone please explain
what happened

JILL
She shouldn’t be allowed in here
Get her out

CHANTING OUT OUT OUT

LOIS’s POV - all eyes on her She ignores them hurriedly
pulling on a pair of joggers over her wet costume She grabs
her bag and makes a run for it

The MOB all fighting for PAULA’s attention JEAN at the
centre of it all Girls swarming round her Faces drift in
and out of focus The sound clicks off as the BLOOD swirls
builds erupts inside her head Then--

PAULA
Jean -- Can you hear me I need
you to supervise this lot so I can
get her out of here
JEAN drifting back into the room nodding

PAULA leading SIOBHAN from the room like a sick child from a
war zone

Girls swarm in around JEAN yelling demanding answers JEAN
steps back head swimming knowing she’s lost control Then
trancelike she exits the room leaving the noise behind her

The door swings on its hinges

INT PE DEPARTMENT OFFICE - LATER 102

JEAN sits across a crowded desk from PAULA staring at a
photo on PAULA’s desk Her and her husband on their wedding
day exchanging vows

PAULA (0C)
She’s saying this isn’t the first
time-- That there was a fight a
few weeks ago that you didn’t
report-- She even went as far as
to say there could be something
going on between you two You and
Lois that is

JEAN looks up slowly Beyond PAULA DAVE and MICHELLE are
talking quietly in the far corner of the room MICHELLE

glances over

PAULA (CONTD)
Jean -- Can you please tell me
what’s going on or am I going to
have to take her word for it

JEAN turns looking almost directly into camera A RABBIT in
a trap She opens her mouth to speak

JEAN
Lois is-- she’s become a little
over-attached you could say

PAULA
If that’s the case why didn’t you
report it to me

JEAN
I didn’t think it was anything to
worry about You know what they’re
like I’ve had worse

The ease with which these words come surprises even JEAN
PAULA
And the locker room You were

there Did you see what happened

JEAN
I saw something but--

PAULA
What What did you see

JEAN
I saw them together and Siobhan
pushing Lois off

PAULA sits back in her chair digesting this

JEAN nods stoic

MICHELLE (CONTD)
Hey hey Come here

JEAN rests her head on MICHELLE’s soft padded shoulder All
those conflicting emotions cloistered up inside her
threatening to free-fall

JEAN

up as JEAN walks into the room Eerie hush in here

PAULA looks tenderly into SIOBHAN’s tear-streaked face

that we ascertain exactly what went
on between you and Miss Jackson
earlier today We take these kinds
of accusations extremely seriously

just need you to repeat what you
told the PE staff earlier this
afternoon

SIOBHAN’s lip quivers She seems uncertain as she looks
towards LOIS who’s fiddling with a Tipp-Ex pen staring at
the sole of her shoe

SIOBHAN
I don’t remember

LOIS looks at JEAN eyes wide begging her to tip the balance
here JEAN clocks her and looks away

PAULA
Look I know this isn’t easy for
you So let me try and help
Earlier if you’1ll remember you
were very upset I was in the hall
when I heard you scream I then ran
into the locker room and found you
in the corner very distressed I
took you to my office where you
told me that Lois had assaulted
you Is that right

SIOBHAN doesn’t answer tears exploding silently

LOIS
No it’s not Tell them

PAULA
Lois I’1l need you to calm down

JEAN watching her drowning in moral turmoil

A bell goes in the distance signalling the end of the day

You just have to nod my love

SIOBHAN desperate for an out wipes a thick globule of snot
from her face with her sleeve and nods

Siobhan’s hand)
Well done

Don’t bother

BALDOCK
Sit back down please

LOIS
You know you haven’t even asked me
what happened You’ve asked all of
them but not me

JEAN
If you’ve got something to say--

happened

INT THE LODGE - LATER THAT NIGHT

JEAN sits in amongst a handful of colleagues in a

quintessential northern boozer MICHELLE appears with a tray

of beers grinning JEAN appears smaller than the rest

chewing her lip doodling on a napkin

A photo of PAULA’s grandchild is passed round JEAN barely

looks at it before passing it on

MICHELLE
How old is he here

PAULA
Oh two three I lose track
Actually no I lie he’d just
turned three there cause it was
election night Bill and I were
glued to the TV Didn’t notice him
puking all over himself

Laughter from the group But JEAN is somewhere else

On MICHELLE keen to snap her out of it--

MICHELLE
You never wanted kids

JEAN contemplates the question
MICHELLE (CONTD)
Aw youd be a great mum I see you
with the younger ones They’re
lucky to have you

JEAN finds this hard to swallow

MICHELLE clocks something behind JEAN slipping into thinly
veiled theatrics FERG 30s a handsome weather worn man
with eyes like rain is making his way over from the bar He

smiles self-consciously as he sits down next to JEAN

FERG
Looks more like a Mr Whippy than a
pint of Guinness

MICHELLE laughs a little too loudly JEAN barely responds

MICHELLE makes eyes at JEAN who begrudgingly turns to look
into FERG’s expectant eyes

FERG (CONTD)
Hiya

JEAN
Hi
FERG
Oh wait youve you’ve got--

He reaches for a paper napkin from the dispenser shakes it
free Then casually invading her personal space gently dabs
the napkin on JEAN’s lip JEAN doesn’t flinch FERG shows her
a bloody mark

children took to the streets of

response to a new law that will
make it illegal for councils to

day Rows of putrid overflowing rubbish bins line the street
Chicken bones and Happy Meal boxes litter the road

A washing line spins weakly behind her The curtains are
closed She walks up to the door and knocks causing a dog to
go berserk

A figure distorted by dappled glass The SOUND of a chain
being put on the door

Go away

A moment on JEAN swallowing this She turns to leave then
turns back this time hammering on the door

JEAN
I need to talk to you Can you open
the door

JEAN taking LOIS in Her offbeat attire replaced by a navy
blue uniform She looks distinctly conformist her inner fire
now dimmed

JEAN
I can give you a lift

LOIS
I’m fine walking

JEAN reaches out to grab the sleeve of her sweatshirt

I know you want more from me But
it’s not-- I can’t be that person
for you Lois

LOIS
I never asked you to be anything

JEAN
It’s not about what you asked
though is it Lois
On LOIS considering But then she’s gone marching towards
the bus stop

117 INT JEAN’S BATHROOM - NIGHT 117

In a tight frame JEAN splashes water on her face at the
sink her hair caked with dye Straightening her back she
does her best to avoid catching her reflection in the
bathroom mirror We follow as she pads out into the corridor
down the stairs

118 INT JEAN’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 118

TV light rippling over JEAN’s gaunt face

‘BLIND DATE’ CONTESTANT (0C)
My nickname is “Mumsy” because I’m
very close to my mother How much
does this worry you and why
(canned nasal laughter)

JEAN picks up the remote switching off the TV Allowing
herself a moment of quiet introspection

FADE TO BLACK

INT CHIPPY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 119
JEAN looking a little edgy in the corner waiting
The RING of the door as VIV slips in opposite her

Palpable hurt and yearning on both sides But also distance
Eventually --

JEAN
Hi

VIV
Hiya

JEAN
Thanks for coming

VIV
Of course

JEAN
How are you

VIV

(despondent)

You know

JEAN sensing she’s lost her Caught between a desire to reach
out and that unrelenting feeling she’s being watched Her
foot grazes VIV’s leg

VIV shifts awkwardly closing her eyes for a moment reaching
for the courage to say what she wants to say But instead--

VIV (CONTD)
D’you want something to drink

JEAN
Yeah in a sec thanks
(beat)
Look I’m really sorry
Beat
VIV
It’s OK
JEAN
It’s not

I should have told ya

I should have done everything
differently

Sick in the head remember

A flicker of a smile but VIV’s not taking the bait

VIV
She reminded me a bit of you you
know When we first met

JEAN
Who Lois

VIV
The girl yeah

JEAN
LAUGHS She’s nothing like me

VIV
Debs thought so too Like a deer in
the headlights

JEAN considers this discrepancy Is it possible for her to

see LOIS as something entirely different Something fierce
and brave Something violent

JEAN
I’m not a deer in the headlights
am I
VIV
Sometimes You know Skittish
JEAN
Skittish

She’s trying to lighten the mood but VIV doesn’t
reciprocate

VIV
Anyway

JEAN
D’you want something to eat

VIV
I ate before

JEAN
Okay I might

She reaches for the menu

VIV
Sorry I didn’t return your calls

JEAN
It’s fine

VIV
No It’s not
Look -- I’ve been here before With
Donna And I--

JEAN
Donna cheated on you with her
husband

VIV
Yeah but -- it’s the same in the
end She wasn’t ready
(beat)
And I can’t do that again

JEAN
I’m gonna quit me job

VIV
What -- Why

JEAN
Because

JEAN leans in closer across the table But VIV inches away

VIV
I don’t think you should quit your
job You love your job You’re good
at your job

JEAN
I did something terrible
(beat)
That girl from the club-- Lois I
dobbed her in to get her off my
case She’s been suspended And I
doubt she’ll be back after this

JEANs eyes fill with thick wet gobs
VIV stares at her for a moment a hint of pity now
VIV
You need to stop being so hard on

yourself

A hand across the table A flicker of hope --

JEAN
I want to be with you Viv We
could go away somewhere

VIV
(retrieving her hand)
No look If we forget about
everything that’s happened
there’1ll be something else

JEAN
No there won’t

VIV
Anyway I don’t want to go away
I’m happy here Listen this isn’t
what I wanted but I can’t keep
doing this it’s not--

JEAN
You don’t have to do this

JEAN reaches a hand across the table taking VIV’s in hers
big step for her But VIV pulls away looking into JEAN’s
eyes for a second Whatever she sees is enough for her to
know She reaches for her coat

JEAN (CONTD)
Please Viv come on

VIV
I can’t do this

With one more pained look in JEAN’s direction VIV gets up

VIV (CONTD)
Sorry I can’t

JEAN slumps back in her chair Filled with RAGE mainly at
herself Under the table she clenches and unclenches her
fists Then lights a cigarette fumbling with the lighter

WAITER (0C)
Ya canne smoke in here pet

JEAN
(pointing at the ashtray)
What are these here for then

JEAN stubs her cigarette out roughly and stands to leave

EXT BOARDWALK - NIGHT 120

JEAN strides down the boardwalk battling gale force winds
eyes streaming

SLOW FADE OUT

INT SASHA’S LIVING ROOM - DAY 121

SASHA and TIM’s living room decorated with full Alice in
Wonderland regalia The pinnacle of straight white middle
class living

A PUNCH and JUDY show has a group of children in fits of
giggles SAMMY sits on a little wooden chair dressed as the
March Hare his whiskered cheeks stained with tears

A small cluster of PARENTS stand in the corner sipping
wintery punch from plastic cups SASHA’s there talking to
LISA 29 JEAN stands awkwardly beside them wearing a lime
green dress that hangs limply from her androgynous frame

LISA
Police Stations don’t offer creches
for their employees Why should
hospitals It’s a ridiculous idea
No What the nursing profession
needs is more men If nursing were
perceived as a male and female
occupation the same as say -
teaching or the civil service
Then there would be a stronger gut
feeling - amongst the powers that
be - to raise nurses salaries

SASHA
I hadnt thought of it like that

TIM
In the meantime what happens when
our children get sick and they’re
picketing outside the hospital
instead of doing their damned jobs

LISA
Well quite

TIM
What’s your take on all this Jean

JEAN shakes her head in a non-committal sort of a way

TIM (CONTD)
You must have an opinion

SASHA
Tim

TIM
I’m just interested to know what
she thinks As someone on the front
line of public services

SASHA
I’m not sure the netball court is
quite the front line--

JEAN
I think it’s easy to forget that
nurses have a duty to provide a
certain standard of care And if
they can’t provide that care
people die

TIM
I’m not sure I--

SASHA
No come on that’s enough Tim
why don’t you go and refresh the
punch

TIM considers this for a moment Then under his wife’s
steely gaze he leaves for the kitchen

On LISA attempting to change the subject--

LISA
God half term really drags
doesn’t it Feel like I’1l need a
holiday to recover

LATER-—

JEAN looking around skittish moving towards the drinks
table Pouring herself a vodka necking it in one

Close by TIM chats to CRAIG 30s - ruddy cheeked cheerful
Catching JEAN in his periphery CRAIG opens up the
conversation

CRAIG
I was just telling Tim about my
divorce proceedings

On JEAN blank for a moment
CRAIG (0C) (CONTD)
Bleeding me dry I tell you You
women don’t realise how good you
have it

He laughs Then off JEAN’s expression--

CRAIG (CONTD)
That was a joke Bad joke Sorry
No offence meant

JEAN
None taken

TIM
Jean went through all this a few
years back

JEAN looking at TIM Thanks for that you prick

CRAIG
Oh right Sorry to hear that Well
youre still in one piece so that
bodes well

He trails off JEAN’s energy devouring him

JEAN
I quite enjoyed it actually
Particularly the part where I bled
him dry

AWKWARD laughter from the men JEAN grins as if she’s on
their team She’s not

CRAIG
So how do you and Tim--

Beat

TIM
Jean is Sasha’s sister Older
sister Craig and I used to work
together

CRAIG
I never knew Sasha had a sister
(beat)
So what do you do Jean

JEAN
I’m a teacher

A beat

CRAIG
Fantastic What d’you teach

JEAN

CRAIG
Right That must be--
(then realising has
nothing to add)
Which school

JEAN
Tyneside

CRAIG
That’s a commute and a half isn’t

JEAN
It’s OK
CRAIG
You didn’t fancy -- what’s Sammy’s

school called

TIM
St Christophers

CRAIG
Yeah St Christophers

TIM
Jean actually used to teach at St
Christophers

CRAIG
Oh--

JEAN
I did for a while yeah

CRAIG
What made you--

JEAN
Got a bit sick of running into the
entire student body at the local
shop

CRAIG
Fair enough You know I’ve never
thought of that

(MORE )

CRAIG (CONTD)
Must be a right pain Although
Parent teacher evenings --
probably quite a good hunting
ground for the recently divorced
am I right

CRAIG elbows TIM in the ribs and they LAUGH

On JEAN just staring at their drunken faces Her stance is
square emboldened by neat liquor Not even pretending to
laugh Just that smile of hers A smile that says if you
have a heart attack right now I won’t dial 999

Eventually they recover from their hysterics

CRAIG (CONTD)
Sorry

JEAN
That’s okay

CRAIG
Got a man on the scene at the
moment then have you Jean

TIM squints bracing himself for the answer

JEAN
No I haven’t no

On TIM unable to conceal his relief

CRAIG
Ah well I’m sure--

JEAN
I’m a lesbian

TIM’s pained expression Pin drop silence JEAN now smiling
like some kind of AI

CRAIG
Sorry Wow I didn’t--

JEAN
That’s OK
(then)
You know what Tim I’ve actually
got to head off can you give this
to Sammy

She hands him a present meticulously wrapped in blue paper

JEAN (CONTD)
Thanks for a great party Love the--

She waves generally at the decor trailing off Then goes to
kiss him on the cheek as if everything’s A OK

TIM
Wait Jean--

But JEAN isn’t listening She’s already striding through the
room Head high TIM and SASHA exchange a fraught glance

EXT PAVEMENT - DUSK 122

JEAN wanders down a suburban road taking off her
uncomfortable shoes Out of nowhere she BURSTS into
hysterics Deep cathartic belly laughter that won’t stop
She sits down in the grass her dress billowing up around
her slowly recovering Laughter giving way to silent tears

Nearby a pack of unbroken HORSES bolt up and down a small
unkempt patch of green Frisky and untamed She watches them
for a moment

FADE OUT

EXT JEAN’S HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING 123

JEAN scrapes ice from the windscreen of her car with renewed
vigour breath heavy from the exertion MAGGIE hops over the
wall but JEAN shoes her away with one swift confident
movement The CLICK of a front door JEAN turns to see ANNE
inviting MAGGIE back inside

JEAN
Morning
ANNE
(after a beat)
Morning

JEAN holds her gaze until ANNE is forced to break it
disappearing back into her house

INTEXT JEAN’S CAR - MOVING - DAY 124

JEAN drives through a run-down part of South Shields It’s
deafeningly QUIET A couple of YOUNG YEMENI KIDS are playing
with a ball near an open fire The smoke makes it hard for
her to see She strains her eyes

INT EXT STREET JEANS’S CAR - DAY 125

JEAN lingers in her car outside a restaurant named SILVER
MOON Customers come and go After a while LOIS dressed in
uniform exits the restaurant with a couple of rubbish bags
She spots JEAN’s car Shocked at first That unnerving
feeling of being watched Then she scowls heading back
inside

OMITTED 126
OMITTED 127
INT EXT JEAN’S CAR STREET - NIGHT 128

JEAN’s feet on the dashboard THE WELL OF LONELINESS in her
hands Something catches her eye and she tosses the book on
the passenger seat starts the engine and swerves into the
road The SOUND of her horn once then again

LOIS embarrassed turns By now JEAN is only a couple of
metres from her she winds down the window

LOIS

What are you doing
JEAN

Can you get in the car
LOIS

What No Why
JEAN

Can you just get in

(beat)
I want to show you something
that’s all I’1l drop you home
after

LOIS
I’m grounded

JEAN
Don’t tell me you’ve been sticking
to that
(then)
I don’t even have to talk to you
okay Just please get in

A beat on LOIS considering

LOIS
Okay

She opens the car door

JEAN
This is for you

She chucks the book in LOIS’s lap But LOIS throws it back
like a hot potato

LOIS
I don’t want your fucking book

JEAN
Okay
(beat)
It’s not very good anyway

LOIS
I thought you weren’t talking

On JEAN That wry smile of hers LOIS pulling her bruised
knees up around her ears stares out the window brooding

JEAN lights a cigarette and winds down the window
LOIS (CONTD)
My dad’s gonna kill you You know
that right

JEAN smiles and mimes zipping her lips

129 EXT SLIP ROAD - NIGHT 129

The Renault hurtles towards the city centre

130 EXT JOHN STREET HOUSING CO-OP - NIGHT 130

JEANs car grinds to a halt outside the Co-op

131 INT JEAN’S CAR - NIGHT 131
LOIS de-fogs the window Straining to see

LOIS
Where are we

JEAN just staring off into the distance Then--

JEAN
Look
(long beat)
I’m-- damaged okay
In a way you’re not Or at least
you don’t have to be

LOIS’s eyes on JEAN Narrowing Contemplating

LOIS
If I don’t have to be why do you

On JEAN outwitted
JEAN LOIS (CONTD)
I don’t know Maybe it’s too
late
It’s not right Pretending
I don’t expect you to
understand-- But I-- You’re right I don’t
(beat)
People failed me And now
Ive failed you
(beat)
I’m not trying to get myself
off the hook or anything like
that
(beat)
But I see you carrying this
thing and you don’t have to
You’re the one with the

problem Not me I don’t know
I know I know I know what I why you think--
did was wrong

LOIS drinks up these words Then--

LOIS (CONTD)
You know it was Siobhan who kissed
me Not that it matters now

JEAN who has been staring blankly ahead turns to face LOIS
She has no answer She just sits there holding LOIS’s blame
Allowing it to wash over her eroding a layer of skin

Muted rage from both sides then a flicker of understanding

LOIS paws at the carpet with her shoe JEAN reaches over and
squeezes her shoulder gently

JEAN
Shall we go

INT JOHN STREET HOUSING CO-OP - NIGHT 132

JEAN and LOIS’s heads just visible as they ascend the
dilapidated staircase

INT JOHN STREET HOUSING CO-OP LIVING SPACE - CONTINUOUS 133

A blue lava lamp illuminates LOIS’s face as she takes in the
scene before her--

A small gathering is underway There’s a casual homely feel
to the celebrations people helping themselves to drinks in
the kitchen others camped out on a bed smoking cigarettes
Others sprawled on the floor passing slices of cake around

Feeling uncomfortable and uninvited LOIS turns to JEAN

LOIS
Why did you bring me here

Before JEAN has a chance to answer ABI bounds over hugging
JEAN warmly

ABI
Hey You came

JEAN
(awkward)
Hiya

ABI
(nodding to LOIS)
And who’s this one

LOIS
I’m Lois

ABI
Hiya Lois Welcome You a friend of
Jean’s then

LOIS shifts her weight awkwardly

JEAN strains her eyes scanning the room Looking for
something Someone

There On the far side of a buffet table is VIV talking to a
WOMAN with beautiful long hair Your quintessential earth-
mother A BABY suckles her breast as they talk VIV reaches
down to stroke the baby’s head JEAN wrestles jealousy
lighting a cigarette

LOIS
What is this place

JEAN
(after a beat)
A housing co-op

LOIS
A what

ABI
A lesbian housing co-op

LOIS
Only lesbians live in this
building

ABI
LAUGHING Er more or less yeah

LOIS considers this

A knife CHINKING on glass ACE clearing her throat

ABI stands on a chair hollering

ABI (CONTD)
Speech

Echoes of agreement from the rabble

She hands
the floor

ACE
I just wanted to say that as some
of you know money has been a
little scarce this year But thanks
to the heroic efforts of The Bog
Fund we were able to throw a
little something together So
Debs my love
(she reaches down to pick
up a box from the floor)
These are for you from all of us
Well technically not from us but
they are for you Love you babe
Happy Birthday

over a box of Dr Martins to DEBS who puts them on
and kisses ACE tenderly

ABI
To the Bog Fund

CHORUS
The Bog Fund The Bog Fund

ACE
Right now let’s get fucked
uuuuuuup

Applause shrieks and jeering from the rabble LOIS smiles
swept up by the energy in the room

LOIS
(to JEAN)
What’s the bog fund

Before JEAN has a chance to answer ACE grabs her enveloping
her in a bear hug

ACE
Hey lady We missed you

On LOIS feeling a little out of her depth ABI noticing
this puts a hand on her shoulder protectively

ABI
Say you get kicked out by your
parents or can’t pay your rent or
something Or you need a new pair
of shoes You can go ask for money
from the Bog Fund

LOIS
(after a beat)
Wait so anyone can ask for money

ABI
LAUGHS Yeah Well any poor
lesbians in the North East

ACE
LAUGHS
(then to JEAN)
Babe you don’t have a drink Let’s
get you a drink

And she drags JEAN away
ABI
(after JEAN)

Ill keep an eye on her

LOIS
Where does the money come from

ABI
People like her

ABI points at JEAN But LOIS isn’t following

ABI (CONTD)
Lesbians with “proper” jobs
Teachers lawyers or whatever can
put money in you know to help out
those who’re more hard up

On LOIS processing reassessing ABI watches her warmed by
her reaction to all this

ABI (CONTD)
How old are you anyway Old enough
for a drink

LOIS nods clearly bullshitting ABI laughs and steers her
towards the kitchen

LATER-—

THE LARKS’ punk anthem ‘MAGGIE MAGGIE MAGGIE OUT OUT OUT’
blasts out of a speaker ACE DEBBIE and all their friends
jump around madly singing along

JEAN sips her drink from an armchair in the corner watching
with a smile We follow her gaze to the kitchen area where
ABI is sitting on the counter gesticulating LOIS hanging
off her every word

VIV’s there too making a drink A visible pang from JEAN
Then as if sensing it VIV turns and they catch each other’s
eyes for a second before both looking away

ACE and DEBBIE collapse onto the sofa next to JEAN talking
nonsense laughing

DEBBIE
(to JEAN)
How did we look
JEAN
Err
ACE

Oi We were stunning Ignore her
babe She’s all bitter and
heartbroken

JEAN finding it hard not to smile despite it all
LATER --
We follow JEAN through the dance floor where ABI and LOIS

are throwing themselves around uneven shadows crossing their
faces as the lava lamp does its thing

INT STAIRCASE - NIGHT 134

Hunched in a ball JEAN puts a cigarette in her mouth
patting down her pockets for a lighter Behind her through
the door into the party - hazy fleeting tableaus Then a
backlit figure heading towards the door A familiar voice

VIV
(sitting down next to
JEAN)
What are you doing out here

JEAN turns moved by this gesture She looks into VIV’s eyes
feeling her brain unravel

JEAN
Hi

VIV
Hiya

JEAN

I’1l be back in in a sec

VIV
Okay

VIV holds her gaze for a moment All that familiarity
flooding back into the space between them Then she stands
and heads back into the party JEAN lights her cigarette and
takes a moment to stare out into the darkness

familiar TIDAL WAVE of shrieking and laughter as the student
body surge through the school gates

We stay with JEAN for a moment

A BOY on a skateboard whizzes by slamming a hand on her
bonnet as he swerves into the playground She barely
registers Gathering herself she opens the car door

Through the car windscreen we watch as JEAN strides across
the playground towards school Halfway an eager YEAR NINE
STUDENT appears anxious for JEAN’s help with something
Before long they’re both swallowed up by the steady flow of
students entering the building
