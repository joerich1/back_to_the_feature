HASPEL
Can you talk about 2011 and what sort of
a percentage increase you anticipate

GENE
People love to talk about percentages
Ned our people do you people do But
when we do sales forecasts in a mature
manufacturing sector like transportation
we should be focusing on how to maintain
growth in absolute dollars

HASPEL
Are you suggesting you arent expecting
any growth in your division next year

Stevens looks down the dais at Gene worried

GENE
Im suggesting that we face increased
foreign competition and a difficult
market for large capital expenditures
like shipbuilding so 2011 will probably
end even or a little up from 2010 I
call that an excellent result in this
credit climate but youre probably going
to call it disappointing

Drew doesnt take the offered hand Stands on his own ready
to rumble Bobby grins pops the ball to a determined Drew
