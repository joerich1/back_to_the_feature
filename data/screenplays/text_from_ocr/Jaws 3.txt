discussion

CALVIN
What youre saying is we have a
Great White shark in the lagoon

MIKE
And a missing man

PHILIP
Unhappy combination Most likely
ones inside the other

KATHRYN
Sharks are man-biters Mister
Hutton Not man-eaters --

PHILIP
(cutting her off
Thats a load of codswopple A
Great White doesnt fear man It
doesnt fear beast Its an orgy
of food and blood

KATHRYN
I think we can capture it Id
like to try

PHILIP
Thats preposterous

CALVIN
Go on Doctor

KATHRYN
No ones ever caught a Great White
except indirectly in fishing nets
I want to dart it and keep it
alive

CALVIN
It would make a marvelous
attraction the only Great
White in captivity

KATHRYN
(confidently)

PHILIP
Calvin let me go down there

KATHRYN
No

PHILIP
(continuing to Calvin)
Itll chop up half a million
dollars of your tropical fish
in two minutes

KATHRYN
Calvin I insist I be allowed
to capture it

PHILIP
Three hundred million years of
evolution have created the
greatest butcher the worlds
ever known
KATHRYN
Its one of the worlds greatest
creatures

PHILIP
A shark could have a hundred
embryos in its sack You know
how many are born Maybe five

CUT TO

UNDERWATER

As the three kick downward Philip and Ike prepare
to film Kathryn notices Philip checking his power-
head and reacts sharply He notices and gives her a
mocking salute making her angrier yet Turning she
starts toward the circling shark

THE SHARK SEQUENCE

Intercutting between Kathryn Philip and Ike and on
the deck of the workboat Mike and Shelly Kathryn
moves toward the shark until it starts to circle her
Philip and Ike beginning to film

Her expert maneuvering is not lost on Philip and he
watches with interest -- Mike on the boat deck
watches what he can with apprehension -- as Kathryn
slowly lures the shark toward her

Suddenly it darts in at her and she jabs the spear

at it (into the audience) causing it to veer away
Kathryn seems surprised by this The shark begins to
circle her again CAMERA PANNING with her as she keeps
an eye on it Philip and Ike keep filming Mike keeps
watching tensely on the deck as Kathryn positions
herself holding the spear extended moving it back
and forth

Abruptly the shark darts in moving so precipitously
that it goes all the way to Kathryn She ducks and
the sharks jaws clamp shut on her air tanks Philip
reacts to this and starts forward to help her as the
shark begins to shake her violently from side to side

Letting go of the spear she tries to hit the shark in
the eye but has no success Philip shows up and she
waves him off He cannot believe her reaction but
d
t

oesnt draw his powerhead only hitting the shark on
e head with the camera This makes it let go of
Kathryns tanks and back off fast Philip shoving it
aside as it passes him drawing his powerhead just to
be safe The shark does not attack him though but
retreats Philip looks at Kathryn She is shaken up
but the chain-mail suit has protected her from injury
She waves him back irritably Shaking his head either
at her or her stupidity he backs off to Ike

keeping a wary eye on the shark as Kathryn kicks up to
the surface to get another spear On deck Mike tries
to speak to her as she grabs the spear but she is
under again before he can say a word Kathryn grimly
sets herself again Seeing this Philip casts his
eyes heavenward as though thinking Dear God the
womans suicidal She jabs the spear toward the
still lingering shark Finally after making a few
nervous passes it goes for her This time she is
able to shoot the sedating spearhead into its stomach
then kicks up toward the surface as fast as she can
the shark starting after her

SURFACE

As she breaks through

KATHRYN
Michael

Mike and Shelly rush there reach down and grab her
hands to haul her up As they do the shark comes
after her They yank her over the railing an instant
before it lunges out of the water and almost bites
her feet off jaws slamming shut in close shot as it
misses its body crashing back into the water
Kathryn looks at Mike her face decidedly pale She
attempts to smile

KATHRYN
(meekly)
» I told you Id get it

The shark bellies up

MIKE
I can use a shot of what hes got

KATHRYN
Me too

Her legs go watery and she leans against the railing
Mike embraces her

Not knowing what to do They start spasmodically as

appear nearby Without a word Mike and Kathryn grab

the dolphins dorsal fins and the dolphins start to
rush them away

THE CHASE

Shots alternating between Mike and Kathryn being pulled
along by the dolphins and the giant shark pursuing them
getting closer and closer When it becomes apparent that
the shark is going to overtake them the dolphins make a
sharp turn and elude its heavier straight-forward impetus
Seeing where they are Mike points downward Kathryn hits
Bobby on the side and he dives abruptly Daisy follows

UNDERWATER

The dolphins diving with Mike and Kathryn as they put
their mouthpieces back in We see that they are outside
the Control Room the men inside looking out at them in
shock Mike lets go of the fin and swims to the lock
gesturing for Kathryn to do the same She does and
both take refuge in the concrete recess as the shark
zooms into FRAME from behind CAMERA rushing at them

INSIDE THE RECESS

As the huge shark comes at them Mike activates the
outer door of the lock and they are washed in just as
the shark smashes its head against the concrete jaws
missing their feet by inches

INT LOCK

The shark still trying to get at them Mike shuts the
outer door and starts to drain the water from the lock

As it comes below their heads they pull out their
mouthpieces and look at each other with dazed relief

He puts his arms around her and they lean their fore-
heads together breathing hard The water is out of

the lock in seconds inside men activate the inner door

INT CONTROL ROOM

As Mike and Kathryn are helped in by the technicians
One of them looks toward the os window suddenly

shattered a wall of water roaring in

Putting their mouthpieces in again as the Control Room
fills with water They look toward

THE SHARK

dividing him

CONTROL ROOM

Starts flooding A tape bank topples crushing
female technician

IMPALED SHARK

Thrashes violently working its way in Its caught
on a huge section of thick glass piercing its side

MIKE AND KATHRYN

Staring at the shark Suddenly the air in Mikes tank
runs out and reacting he taps Kathryns arm She sees
his problem takes a deep breath and gives him her
mouthpiece They look toward the window at a loud SOUND

THEIR POV - THE SHARK

Still very much alive throwing its gigantic weight
forward getting closer and closer to CAMERA each
violent lurch cutting its side open more blood pouring
from the jagged rent

ANGLE PAST SHARK ON MIKE AND KATHRYN

As it gets closer and closer to them They back away
are blocked by a console

ANGLE PAST MIKE AND KATHRYN

Showing the shark closer yet Despite the impaling

blade of glass despite the internal injuries the
shark -- in seconds -- will have them

CLOSE ON MIKE AND KATHRYN

Sharing the mouthpiece huddled together helpless now

Then Kathryns eyes widen both react

THE SHARK

Shaking its head as it inches forward jaws open wide
MIKE AND KATHRYN

Drawing back Kathryn SCREAMS

THE SHARK

Emerging from its maw is Philips body
PHILIPS BODY

We see the GRENADE locked in his fist

MIKE

Quickly grasps a metal strip from the tape bank and
fashions a crude hook

MIKE

Times his move perfectly and KNOCKS the grenade out of

Philips locked fist The grenade comes to rest between
the sharks TEETH Kathryn gives Mike some air then

MIKE

Leaps forward and SNATCHES the grenade out of the
sharks mouth

MIKE

Hurriedly wraps a metal strip around the grenade
KATHRYN

Acts as a decoy and lures the sharks attention as
MIKE

PULLS the grenade pin and

SHOVES GRENADE

Into the distracted sharks mouth

MIKE GRABS KATHRYN

And they roll behind a Control Room desk and computer
terminal console

FULL SHOT SHARK

As the shark is BLOWN OUT backward through the window
opening torn in half by the explosion its massive

remains starting to slide toward the lagoon bottom
turning the water crimson

MIKE AND KATHRYN

Grabbing the stunned Kathryn Mike pulls her to the
window and out starting upward through the bloody
water

441 UNDERWATER - MIKE AND KATHRYN

Sharing the air they slowly float to the surface
buddy-buddy breathing

442 SURFACE

Mike and Kathryn break through Helping each other
they make their way over to a camera pylon

443 MIKE AND KATHRYN

Cling to the pylon and each other

444 KATHRYN

Suddenly looks alarmed as she remembers

KATHRYN
Bobby and Daisy

Mike looks about no sign of the dolphins

445 KATHRYN

Slaps the water hard three times
No dolphins

She does it again

And again

446 KATHRYN

And now in total ANGER AND FRUSTRATION she pounds the
water like Rocky on the punching bag until she is
drained and Kathryn breaks down sobbing as Mike holds
her trying to comfort her

447 DOLPHINS

Come shooting to the surface Theyre banged and
bruised but are chirping excitedly and as HAPPY to
see Kathryn and Mike as they are to see them

DOLPHINS

Slowly swim around the hugging Mike and Kathryn as
CAMERA PULLS UP to show the Sea Kingdom in all its
entirety safe at last

FADE OUT
