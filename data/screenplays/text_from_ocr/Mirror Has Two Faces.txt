CREDITS ROLL OVER MONTAGE

As Gregory and Rose prepare for their day WE INTERCUT
between the two yet never revealing their faces We hear
ROSE MORGAN IN VOICE OVER as

We see Gregory after showering methodically folding his
towels then opening his medicine cabinet where we find
perfectly ordered rows of products organized according to
their category - a row of medicines a row of colognes a row
of shaving products

ROSE (VO)
He bathed in sacred preparation of
the precious courtship to come

We see Roses messy bathroom with towels on the floor and
a cup of coffee balancing precariously on the sink

ROSE (Contd)
“She anointed herself with holy
scented oil

Rose slaps on Baby Powder choking from the dust

- We see Gregory tip-toeing through his bedroom so as not to
disturb a BLONDE WOMAN sleeping in his bed He opens a bureau
drawer revealing perfectly arranged color coded socks

ROSE (Contd)
For him there would be no
other for it had been written and
ordered thus

Rose stands with her back to camera as she struggles to
put on panty hose while the VO narrates

ROSE (Contd)
That She the Queen of Heaven
would look in sweet wonder upon only
him

- We see GREGORY LARKIN dressed in a sports jacket and tie
washing his coffee cup before placing it in the dishwasher
He exits the kitchen to the hall and checks himself in an
antique mirror He is a handsome man in his forties - round
wire rimmed glasses thick wavy hair well built He exudes
control and order and intelligence

We see an antique vanity Camera opens on a drawer filled
with un-opened beauty products and cosmetics as well as
packages of donuts cookies and candies Roses hand reaches
in and pauses We dont know whether she is reaching for a
lipstick or an coffee cake Finally the hand grabs the
coffee cake and closes the drawer Camera follows her hand as
she places the coffee cake into a tote bag filled with books
and notebooks Camera angles on the double mirror atop the
messy vanity to reveal ROSE MORGAN as she looks at herself
Slightly overweight by todays standards she wears no make-
up and a formless dress Her mousy brown stringy hair hangs
straight in a blunt cut so she can run her hands through it
when she talks excitedly Rose is a funny vibrant
intelligent woman in her forties who clearly spends her
passions on ideas instead of appearances partly out of
necessity Beauty has never been a quality anyone attributed
to Rose As she sits gazing at her reflection ‘wondering if
she should fix herself up any further WE HEAR HER VOICE OVER

ROSE (Contd V0)
For they had spoken the word And

the word they had spoken was a word
of desire

She waves her hand at her reflection in a carefree manner as
if to say “Why bother She exits

ROSE (V0)

Inanna appeared shining before him

like the light of the moon

Our Camera reaches the classroom entitled LOVE STORIES FROM
STAR CROSSED LOVERS TO FATAL ATTRACTIONS LT 140

INT ROSE MORGANS CLASS - DAY

Camera pans the students who are captivated by Rose reading
in front of the room

ROSE (0S)
Inanna spoke As for me the young
woman Who will plow my high field
- Who will plow my wet ground
Who will plow my holy vulva
(comments)
Isnt that great

The students laugh Camera pans to front of the the room

ROSE (Contd)
He replied Queen of Heaven I
Dumuzi will Inanna commanded -
“Then plow my vulva man of my heart

The class laughs as we arrive on ROSE MORGAN - standing on a
desk reading aloud from a book Behind her hangs a map of
Ancient Sumeria

ROSE (Contd)

Wouldnt it be wonderful to say that
to a man I have a dinner date
tonight maybe Ill work it into the
conversation during dessert

(play-acts)
I was thinking that maybe after
coffee youd like to come home and
plow my holy vulva

The class acts more like an audience at a comedy club Rose
is full of enthusiasm and love for her students

ROSE (Contd)

Its not really a date though Hes
not my type but hes been asking me
for months so I figured the only way
to get rid of him was to actually go
out with him

(big laughs)

(continues reciting)
He shaped my loins with his fair
handsHe filled my lap with cream
and milk OOo0000 He laid me
down on the fragrant honeybed
Dont you love that My
honeyman sweetens me always He
is the one my womb loves best
Tongue playing one by one My
fair Dumuzi did so fifty times

(closes book)
FIFTY TIMES Youve got to love the
guy Inanna is considered by many to
the first love story ever written -
A Sumerian epic dated around 2000
BC And as you will see in many
Goddess mythologies our players will
consist of an older female with a
beautiful younger male whose sole
purpose was to serve the divine womb
Now looking over some of the more
modern love mythologies including
recent film I want a comparative
essay examining how the malefemale
roles have shifted and I want the
title of the essay to be - WHAT THE
HELL HAPPENED

The class breaks up with laughter

INT GREGORY LARKINS CLASSROOM DAY
GREGORY LARKIN teaches a room full of students He is
extremely awkward and pedantic as a teacher The atmosphere

of this classroom is a stark contrast to Roses

Camera pans the rows of bored students trying hard to receive
the lesson while others have given up entirely

Some of the female students however are very interested
albeit in Gregorys butt as he paces the floor reading from
a text book Their eyes never rise above his waist

GREGORY

INT BLOOMINGDALES COSMETICS DEPT - LATE AFTERNOON

Camera captures a variety of images various women being
made-over by cosmetic saleswomen Giant display ads of
models with perfect skin and perfect hair caressing skin
lotion and perfume And mirrors - everywhere - to
illuminate the faults in every potential customers
appearance

One of the display ads is a Gap-like-Annie Lebowitz-
celebrityadvertisement of a stunning auburn haired woman

In the corner it reads JESSIE ARTHUR POETESSAYIST for
ILLUMINATION COSMETICS

A circular mirror on a cosmetic counter pivots down to reveal
Rose looking at herself in comparison to one of the
angelic beauties on display Rose places her hair behind her
ears and smooths down her bangs - then gives up The OS VOICE
a SALESWOMAN from behind the counter pulls her attention

SALESWOMAN

CLAIRE

sleeping the other night and I wake
up and hes staring at me

ROSE
Thats kind of sweet

CLAIRE
Please - its like sleeping with a
flashlight on you I was in the
middle of one of my lesbian fantasy
dreams and hes staring at me like
Im supposed to include him

CLAIRE (contd)
I swear if he wasnt gorgeous rich
and straight I wouldnt even bother
What should I do

ROSE

CLAIRE
Yes Youve known him longer Could

few hours a day where I completely
forget that

ROSE
(irritated)
Then move out Claire What do you
want me to say Jesus

CLATRE
What are you getting angry about

Claire looks over Roses shoulder unhappy by what she sees

CLAIRE (Contd)
Oh I dont believe this

Rose turns to see ALEX approaching Alex is an extremely
handsome man late thirties-early forties with blue eyes
jet black hair and athletes body Rose is clearly flustered
by his presence - like a woman who is afraid her true
feelings might show Alex arrives at the table and kisses
Roses cheek

ALEX
Hi Rose

CLAIRE
What did you do follow me

ALEX
I called your mother She told me
where Rose was I think its
important we talk

CLATRE
I think its important I go to the
ladies room ALONE Excuse me

Claire leaves in a huff Alex pulls up a chair and sits down
beside Rose

ALEX
This must seem all pretty childish to
you

ROSE

Thats not for me to say

ALEX
It does to me What am I doing Rose

ROSE
Why is everybody asking me I feel
like the Aunt in Gigi

ALEX
Im sorry Its me I dont know
whats wrong with me If she doesnt
wake up every morning telling me how
estatic she is I worry Ive never
behaved like this over a woman before

This info doesnt exactly thrill Rose But she attempts to
help recognizing how upset he is

ROSE
Maybe you just need to relax your
grip a little buddy Take things for
granted a little bit more I mean
youre living together - what more
proof do you need

ALEX
Im not happy Rose I live everyday
worried shes going to take off
Maybe this isnt love Maybe its
just obsession Whatever it is I
hate it

Rose is both surprised and thrilled to hear this

ALEX (Contd)
I was thinking - maybe I should ask
her to move out for while At least
I wont worry about her abandoning me
anymore then she can feel what its
like to be without me What do you
think

Rose nods speechless Alex takes her hand and stares at her
lovingly Roses heart races as SHE FANTASIZES Alex saying

FANTASY —-

ALEX (Contd)
She isnt you Goddess of my heart
Have I been so blind

He reaches for her and KISSES HER PASSIONATELY
REALITY

ALEX (Contd)
Thank for listening Rose

He squeezes her hand affectionately as Claire returns Rose
feels self-conscious as if her fantasy were seen by others

EXT ENDICOTT BOOK GALLERY - NIGHT

Camera on a poster in the window which reads PROF GREGORY
LARKIN PROFESSOR MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES COLUMBIA
UNIVERSITY AUTHOR OF THE NEW BEST SELLER ABSOLUTE TRUTH
A STUDY OF THE MATHEMATICAL EQUATION CALLED CREATION BOOK
SIGNING AT ENDICOTT BOOK GALLERY 550 COLUMBUS AVE 8 PM

INT ENDICOTT BOOK GALLERY NIGHT

A gathering of New Yorks intelligentsia wine and brie crowd
are seated in a room facing Gregory at a podium surrounded
by copies of his book He is uneasy about speaking in front
of a crowd

GREGORY
Thank you all very much I am honored
by this warm and gracious welcome

li

GREGORY (contd)
»My uh fiance Katherine told me
that um Absolute Truth might be
too strong for the title of a
theoretical science book

Some audience giggles including KATHERINE who sits in the
front row She is the woman we saw earlier in Gregorys bed
a beautiful sweet-natured blonde

GREGORY (Contd)
My answer to her was - who who
said this was a theoretical book

Laughter Gregory is pleased his attempt at humor paid off

GREGORY (Contd)
As I stand here at the end of a
journey I am reminded of something
Descartes once said -

Gregory as he loses himself in these words which obviously
mean a great deal to him

GREGORY (Contd)
--For whether I am awake or
asleep - two and three always make
five and the square can never have
more than four sides and it does not
seem possible that truths so clear
and apparent can be suspected of any
uncertainty Numbers and the
principles they represent are
unchanging and everlasting and
underlie everything we are and
everything we do They are a
dependable constant in a
frighteningly undependable world And
they have consumed my life the way I
suppose an artist might be consumed
by color or a musician by harmonics

Gregory stops when he sees a most unnerving sight -

JESSIE ARTHUR essayistpoet is entering from the back of
the room and takes a seat on the aisle Just as in the
advertisement she is a knock-out She looks up to Gregory
and smiles Gregory almost loses his train of thought
completely He cant take his eyes off her

He accidently knocks over a water glass as he repeats himself
to find his place

Applause

INT BACK

GREGORY (Contd)

Uh musician by harmonics This
book took over over five years
and it is not without a little
sadness that I say goodbye to it
consuming my days and nights Thank
you

Angle on Gregorys friend HENRY FINE a robust
Henry Miller-like middle aged professor with the libido of a
teenage rock star Noticing Gregory staring at the back

Henry turns to see Jesse as does Katherine

HENRY

Shed invite Mrs Oswald to John
Johns wedding

Gregory exits having splashed water on his face leaving the
sides of his hair still wet with strands sticking out askew
He looks a bit deranged

GREGORY
We better get out there before they
meet How do I look

Henry looks him up and down He notices that Gregory forgot
to zip his fly - his white briefs showing through - but
decides not to tell him

HENRY
Great

INT ENDICOTT GALLERY LATER

Gregory and Henry enter with the reception in full swing
There is no specific dialogue just general conversation
throughout the room

Gregory is uncomfortable being the center of so much
attention He smiles graciously People smile back wondering
why his hair is wet and his fly is open They look over the
crowd-to see Jessica and Katherine talking Katherine spots
them and waves them over with a bright smiling face Henry
remarks about Katherines sunny innocent personality

HENRY
Poor kid - shes looks like a baby
seal about to be clubbed

They move through the crowd to the two women Gregorys
breathing gets short Henry is enjoying this immensely
Innocent Katherine acts every bit the hostess

KATHERINE
I didnt know you knew Jessica
Arthur I use your products all the
time

JESSICA
Theyre not my products I just did
an endorsement for them a while back
(to Gregory)
Hello Greg Youre looking well

Jessie eyes his fly and smiles Gregory looks down
mortified and turns to zip up as Henry introduces himself

HENRY
Hello Im Henry Fine

Jessie just smiles not saying hello in return

HENRY (Contd)
Ive heard so much about you And
Ive just finished your latest
collection Terrific stuff I
especially like the one about the two
housewives who make love over a
dishwasher Quite a fantasy

JESSICA

Gregory stops breathing Henry cant wait for an answer
Jessie pauses to heighten the suspense

JESSICA

JESSICA (Contd)
Congratulations

GREGORY

She walks away Katherine gives Gregory a peck on the cheek
then turns to talk to a nearby friend Henry whispers

HENRY
Well - youre in the clear

But Gregorys expression is still disturbed He opens his
palm to Henry to reveal A SMALL CARD which Jessica slipped in
as they shook hands Henry reads HOTEL MARK ROOM 2718

HENRY (Contd)

doorway and stops

HANNAH MORGAN is a beautiful Elizabeth Taylor sixty year old

DISSOLVE TO
INT HOTEI ROOM NIGHT

Gregory and Jessica ravage each other tearing clothes
devouring kisses cries of pleasure All the while Gregory
releases something in him that is completely antithetical to
his college professor persona We see an abandon and
fearlessness that comically borders on madness

TIME LAPSE
LATER SAME LOCATION

The room looks like a bomb dropped Clothes furniture bed
sheets food - all tossed and strewn about Camera finds
Jessie sitting naked wearing nothing but Gregorys tie
voraciously eating room service Gregory sits against the
headboard staring at her in adoration hanging on every word

JESSIE
It was in Ravello and I happened to
follow this nice looking middle aged
woman into a church I saw her take
out this crumpled piece of paper
kiss it leave it in the pew and walk
out So of course TIT had to look

©

COWT INUED

JESSIE (contd)
and what it was was a novena with
instructions in Italian leave this
in the church on the ninth day of the
month And the prayer was Dear God
Please bring him back to me
written three times in a row Now
you know me I had find this woman so
I caught up with her in the market
place and I told her I was a writer
for some Christian paper in America
and would she talk to me I bought
her some coffee and she told me she
was asking God to bring back her dead
husband I said but do you actually
believe that your husband can rise
from the dead She said no no no
She knew her husband would always
be dead but there was another man
alive who was interested in her and
she was beginning to lose the feeling
of her husband in her heart
and she was asking God to bring him
back in there because she had
loved him so much she didnt want
to forget no matter what happened
with this new man And I thought - my
God to love someone so much you
still want the feeling
of loving them even though you know
you can never be with them again

Gregory is COMPLETELY MESMERIZED BY HER

JESSIE (Contd)
So Ive started another book And
its about this woman She went to
God she told me because when she
fell in love with her husband she
became very religious because she
was so grateful for such a feeling
It was the first time she knew she
had a soul It made me think about
us You know no matter how many
others I get involved with - the only
thing that makes sense to me is the
craziness we have when were
together

JESSIE (contd)
When I think about it this is the
longest relationship Ive ever had
(She devours him with
a kiss)
I sometimes think were only ever one
whole person when were together

She devours him with a kiss He melts She returns to her
food Gregory stares at her until he gets the nerve to ask -

GREGORY
Its a man isnt it

JESSICA
What is

GREGORY

The reason youre here - in New York

JESSICA
(hesitates then)
Its over

GREGORY
Are you staying in town

JESSICA
Depends French Fry
(He shakes no)
Are you and Katherine getting married

GREGORY
Well we reached that point where
weve been together too long We
either had to get married or stop
seeing each other

JESSIE
So which is it going to be

GREGORY
(helpless)
Why do you do this to me

Jessica hesitates - knowing this moment would come

GREGORY (Contd)
You dont know what Im like after
you leave I nearly lost my mind last
time I couldnt think straight I
couldnt work I had no control and
I didnt care I remember teaching a
calculus class when I suddenly
thought of making love to you and I
had to run into the teachers lounge
to masturbate

JESSTE
(impressed)
Really

GREGORY

You appear then disappear and in
between I fool myself with other
women If youre going to destroy me
then do it Tell me I mean nothing to
you Tell me you make love like that
with other men Tell me you feel
nothing for me

But Jessie shakes her head She cannot tell him that Gregory

grabs her

He kisses

into an embrace

GREGORY (Contd)
Then marry me Dont you see Loving
you is my dream my nightmare my
faith my madness Dont leave
me in the real world with the Godless
and the sane

JESSTE
(really impressed)
Shit

her until she pulls away

JESSICA
Let me ask you something Greg You
think youd still feel the same way
after being married a few years Do
you think youd still lose your mind
I dont want to be some miserable
wife who only remembers a man loving
her this much

GREGORY
Forget marriage Just stay with me

JESSICA

how I think real love works -

keep it the way it is Greg Lets
keep dying for each other No matter
who Im with youre still the only
man Il ever really love Isnt that

GREGORY

CORNERED HATS - taking care as if she were expecting company
instead of just her mother

INT DINING ROOM NIGHT

sweat suit Her plate is full but she has yet to take a bite
She has a RITUAL of preparing her food that is deliberate and
intricate - mixing her mustards and steak sauces into one
round form on her plate mixing and cutting her salad
utilizing her fork and knife in such as way as to get little
bits of meat vegetable and starch onto one forkfulall
with intense concentration and purpose

Camera then arrives on her mother HANNAH staring at her
performing this ritual She is fully made-up wearing a —
sweater outfit complete with jewelry

and dressing on her plate

DORIS

ROSE

(eating)

I gotta be honest with you though
Im not looking forward to being maid
of honor

DORTS
I was maid of honor nine times I
think when I hit ten I should get a
free husband and dishes
(leans in)
You know it might not even happen
Claires such a nut

ROSE
Doesnt matter He asked He wants
her God what was I thinking That
all of a sudden this veil would be
lifted and he would want me instead
of this gorgeous woman with no
stomach whose ten years younger

DORIS
It could happen

CONT INUED

ROSE
I should have never had coffee with
him that first time he asked He was
too good looking I knew I couldnt
handle it Never again I mean
youve got to come to terms with your
life or else whats the point I11
never be a beauty Ill never have
some gorgeous guy in love with me
screaming my name in the streets
Ill never have one of those crazy
passionate all- consuming fucking
for hours in some sweaty motel room
by the side of a highway love affairs

DORIS
(turned on)
You should write

ROSE
Whats depressing is to realize Im
as bad as everyone else I mean
whats wrong with Barry Neufeld

DORIS
He irritates the shit out of you and
he looks like Mr Peabody

ROSE
Why should that matter - Im no great
prize
DORIS

ROSE
I mean what the hell is love anyway
What does it even mean today

DORIS
Sounds like tomorrows lesson

ROSE
Yeah right Those who cant do teach

DORIS
Honey Im so sorry

Rose softens the tears coming through a bit

ROSE

Oh its all right I hate the way I
sound Why should this bother me I
have a good life I contribute

DORIS
Youre just lonely honey Youre
human Itll pass

ROSE
The thing is I want so little Im
not asking for diamond rings and a
house full of kids I just want
someone - who knows me They way
people in love know each other -
isnt that stupid Their favorite
toothpaste their nightmares their
secrets Thats what cures
loneliness When somebody else is out
there who knows who you are and
whose thinking about you And who
wants you

DORIS
And you think thats easier to get
than diamond rings Honey you need
a change Why dont you move out
get your own place

ROSE
No Living alone sounds very Holly
Golightly in theory but the truth is
you come home to an empty apartment
every night Im not pretty enough to
live alone Id turn into a cat lady
who flirts with delivery boys

DORIS
Well if its any consolation I bet
even beautiful people get lonely
Look at that woman over there

fighting not to cry over her drink

A STUDENT HAL catches up with them holding a report
HAL
Hi Mr Larkin Hal Benning

HENRY
You are psychotic I cant tell you
how much Im enjoying this

cuT To

INT ROSES CLASSROOM - DAY

Gregory and Henry sit in the back of the classroom while Rose
gives an impassioned lecture to her spellbound students

ROSE
I believe its our addictions to
illusions like perfect sex and true

love that are actually keeping people

today separate and alone Falling
in love is a man-made conceit
Before the Industrial Revolution -

before men left the home for business

and women became the leisure class -
before sex and beauty were used as
marketing tools for the propagation
of the species

She refers to daguerreotypes and tintypes depicting images of

women as objects of beauty

ROSE (Contd)
What drew men and women together I

can tell you one thing - it must have

been a lot more real than whats
drawing them today A fifty percent
divorce rate among married couples -
more single parents than you can
count Which is fine - but why
Because people want children and not
relationships Relationships are too
hard Why Because we are asked to
meet ridiculous romantic standards

Gregory is mesmerized

ROSE (Contd)
Do you know how many lonely people
there are waiting for this perfect
romantic love - this illusion when
actually their perfect mate might be
right in front of them only they
cant recognize it

COMTI NUED

ROSE (contd)
And sex well how often have you
heard Oh he isnt my type Oh
shes doesnt turn me on and people
stay alone This obsession with
beauty and lust while everything
around us is decaying Everyones
lover has to be attractive and
successful and funny and charming and
the truth is there simply arent
enough funny successful attractive
charming people to go around Were
human - we spit and sweat and gain
weight and age and why isnt that all
right Because of the malicious
fantasies created by fashion
designers and commercials about
deodorant sharing that tell us its
not Dont settle for second best
Be the best smell the best get
the beautiful guy lose the weight
and marry an Adonis - perfect love
does exit - right here in this
bottle for only 2999 And whether
were conscious of it or not we fall
for it The idea of having to fall
in love has become the most
contagious and deadly virus of
twentieth century - killing
relationships before they can even
begin Leaving men and women who
have so much to offer - excluded As
1f relationships were only meant for
the select the beautiful and the few
instead of being everyones
birthright

Rose is panting She has given this speech without a breath
The class and Gregory sit stunned Waiting Rose feels

exposed for a moment and tries to sum up

ROSE (Contd)
(genuine belief)

We live in such a transitory world
People marry for love which
fadesor beauty or passionwhich
fade You ever notice how most
friendships last longer than most
marriages

ROSE (contd)
Is it even possible anymore for a man
and a woman to truly see each other
and come together for something
realI dont know
(pause)
Questions comments

The class breaks out into applause Rose smiles feeling
great love for these kids Gregory looks as if hes been
transformed by a revelation

EXT CAMPUS - DAY
Henry walks with an excited Gregory

GREGORY
Shes amazing

HENRY
Well she talks a good line

GREGORY
What do you mean I thought she made
a lot of sense

HENRY
Well considering how she looks I
guess yeah - shes got a point

Gregory stops Henry stops surprised

GREGORY
I didnt notice how she looked

HENRY
Thats my point

GREGORY
Ive had beautiful women Henry Ive
had great sex And Im alone I
want to meet her

HENRY
Look - youre coming off of Jessie
again Youre not thinking straight

HENRY (contd)
Beside in my opinion sex is the
only reason people get together
because its the only divine act
humans can accomplish It fulfills
everyones inherent desire to return
to God It is my belief that coming
will replace praying in the 21st
century Im thinking of writing a
theological treatise on it and
calling it Theoboffism

GREGORY

All I know is Im lonely Maybe
Jessie is my one real love - so what
Maybe my mother was right or maybe
were only allowed one a lifetime and
I got stuck with someone I cant
have But maybe theres something
else I can have Something I can
trust feel safe with build with

HENRY
With her

GREGORY
Well I dont knaw Maybe Why
not Shes seems like a fascinating
woman

HENRY
Fine But no matter what you want in
a woman you cant deny the fact
that there has to be a physical
attraction too

GREGORY
Im not so sure

a desk piled high with opened books and papers The walls are

something

Rose immediately recognizes this is a good looking guy asking
her for coffee and her “Alex alarms go up

ROSE
Uh well no sorry Im actually
scheduled for something now soon

GREGORY
Oh well maybe some other time

to her water cooler She gets some cold water in a small
paper cup and quite matter-of-factly THROWS THE WATER IN HER
OWN FACE

ROSE (Contd)
That was close

INT ROSES BEDROOM NIGHT

Rose opens the bottom drawer of her vanity and reveals HER
ASSORTMENT OF CUPCAKES AND SWEETS She extracts a package of
cupcakes then moves to a CD PLAYER raises the volume We
hear THE BANDS IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE She raises an
already lit JOINT to her mouth and inhales As she sings
along getting stoned we get a glimpse into a younger

Rose a sixties hopeful with a great joy and thirst for
life before any expectations vanished She then inhales a
bit too much and must use every effort not to cough out
loud - banging her hands against the furniture her eyes
tearing She makes sure to exhale out an opened window She
takes a deep breath then douses out the joint on the sill
She takes her cupcake to her bed and makes a tray out of an
art book Laying down she serves herself the cupcake
listening to the music and watching the ballgame on a TV with
no sound opposite the bed She comments to herself -

ROSE
Life is good

She takes a bite of her cupcake and watches the game and
listens to The Band All of a sudden she freezes - as if a
thought had crossed her mind and got stuck there We can tell
by her expression that she isnt really watching the game or
listening to the music or even consciously chewing Shes
thinking about Gregory But then she decides

ROSE (Contd)

No I was right to say no That was
a good move Have lunch with a guy
like that next thing you know In
cooking for him and holding his hand
when he has problems and fantasizing
about raping him in a restaurant
Never again The end End of story

INT BURGER PALACE DAY

Rose and Doris listen to Gregory explain his book as they
wait for their lunch

GREGORY

»-8o0 what I had hoped to accomplish
with the book was to show within this
Universal Order numbers are not just
numbers but symbols that represent -
how should I say it - metaphysical
concepts First theres the One the
Universal the All - that from which
everything springs and is ever
contained in - you still with me

ROSE
Im holding on

DORIS
Im off the cliff

GREGORY

(enjoying himself)
Then we divided with One into the
Two - the duality of the One and
Ones awareness of itself through
its opposite the Two Then theres
three which is the relationship
between the two and the one

ROSE
So four would be the result of the
relationship - the product produced
by the sun

GREGORY
Thats right Did you read the book

ROSE
No I almost bought it though I held
it in my hands in the bookstore for
a good ten minutes

GREGORY
Thats all right Ill send you a
copy but getting back to the
three for a minute what you might
find interesting for what you teach
is the importance of the
relationship See without the three
relationship - a number or a person
is just

ROSE
Spinning its own gears

GREGORY
Exactly This is marvelous

ROSE
I know First time I had lunch with
a guy where I feel like Im winning
on a game show
Gregory suddenly feels insecure

GREGORY
Im sorry I didnt mean to lecture
Excuse me a moment

Gregory exits to the bathroom Doris nudges Rose

DORTS
Whats wrong with you Hes a doll

ROSE
What I didnt say anything Hes a
very nice guy Now lets eat the damn
lunch and get the hell outta here

What are we in fifth grade He likes
me He likes my brain

DORIS
So Take it slow One organ at a time

Gregory returns just as A WAITER appears with two salads and
a PEPPER MILL He is about to pepper Roses salad

ROSE
No pepper for me But could you get
me a little side dish of extra
dressing

DORIS
Me too

She begins her ritual of carefully cutting and mixing her
salad - picking out the wilted or bad looking leaves as she
speaks Gregory is fascinated by her ritual

GREGORY
Youre class is remarkable Maybe you
can sit in on my class on next week

ROSE
What was it you wanted to discuss
about my teaching

Gregoryand Rose are having dinner with Henry and his date
a beautiful blonde model named CANDY Each pair is involved
in conversation The camera cuts between the two
conversations

ROSE
- I just think you have to relate
what you teach them in a way that
touches their lives a bit more
directly Let them get to know you

GREGORY
Youre right How

Gregory listens like a disciple Henry and Candy are having
a different conversation

CANDY
Im very much a free spirit If I
dont feel like going to a party I
wont go just because other people
are

HENRY
I really respect that

Gregory and Rose continue

ROSE
You need to loosen up a little Dont
wear a jacket and tie Joke around
Find the humor in it

GREGORY
Find the humor in calculus

ROSE
Well - if numbers represent some
metaphysical meaning in the Universe
uh theres got to be a joke in
there somewhere I mean metaphysics
the universe its hilarious

GREGORY
Really

Back to Henry and Candy
HENRY
You like those Calvin Klein ads -
those guys in the underwear

CANDY
Oh yeah - I think theyre hot

HENRY
I think theyre disgusting

Rose cant help but over hear Henrys comments and stops with
Gregory to listen in

HENRY (Contd)
I just think that for women to be
represented like that in advertising
its much more artistic When its
man I find it almost pornographic

ROSE
Why

HENRY
Well artists have been honoring
naked women through their canvases
for centuries

ROSE
Gee the last time I looked the David
had a dick

Things are getting heated Gregory is loving it

HENRY
All Im saying is everywhere you
look there are these young guys with
washboard stomachs looking like Gods
in some homo-erotic fantasy

CANDY
I think theyre hot

No one pays attention to her and she notices it as Henry

speaks directly to Rose

HENRY
I didnt mean to offend you or-

ROSE
Im not offended I just think times
are changing In some tribes - like
the Wodaabes its the men who spend
hours in make-up sessions and are
judged in beauty contests by the
women And theyre a much older
society than ours - maybe were just
catching up Men as objects of female
lust is quite natural and if women
are going to make themselves sick and
surgically alter themselves to stay
in the running you men are going to
have skip the extra beer and tighten
your butts too

Gregory smiles proudly Henry lifts his glass as if to toast
her Candy feels left out and rises

CANDY
Excuse me a minute

Only Rose can sense Candys sudden discomfort

ROSE
Doesnt that bother you

CANDY
No I plan to be married within five
years then Ill never have to worry
about it again I dont kid myself
I know the things I can offer a man
a lot of other women can too Its
all timing ya know You just have to
hit that one guy whose ready to stop
sampling everything he sees And then
you can stop too Its different for
women like you I think

ROSE
Why

CANDY
If a guy falls for you you know its
for something thatll last You dont
have to worry about losing it as you
get older Youll probably get even
smarter when you age

ROSE
Can I ask you a question If you
could switch places with me would
you

Candy stops applying lipstick She feels uncomfortable by the
question Her answer is obviously no

See thats the difference

INT ROSES CLASSROOM DAY

Gregory sits in on another of Roses lectures

ROSE
Around the 12th Century they had a
thing called Courtly Love - and it
was a love usually between a knight
and a lady he idolized
worshippedBut the rules were they
could never have sex never be
married and yet they must always keep
their passion for each other
aliveIt was as if they took this
baser human love and through their
restrictions squeezed everything out
it that was thought to be impure or
temporary It was thought to be one
of the highest expressions of love
As opposed to the more human
everyday going-to-the-bathroom-in-
front-of-eachother kind of love

Laughter Gregory is inspired

Why are you talking like that

ROSE
Im wearing so much Im afraid itll
break How do I look

Well according to this cosmetics

my nose is crooked my chin is chubby
and my skin is confused Should I

humiliated I spent a lot of money on

Gregory searches for a bill
EXT NEW YORK STATE THEATRE - NIGHT

Celebrities exit a limo and are immediately photographed at
every angle by the photographers as they walk along the red
carpet and are swept into the theatre

Another limo drives up and out of it exit ROSE AND GREGORY
Gregory is clearly nervous They move down the red carpet
For a few steps nothing happens Gregory almost panics Until
suddenly the two photographers Rose paid off start clicking
the cameras furiously at them

Like a chain reaction ALL THE OTHER PHOTOGRAPHERS start
clicking their cameras Roses plan worked Rose begins to
enjoy her momentary celebrity playing it for all its worth
Gregory is amazed as they reach the door and are quickly
swept inside by the doorman

INT NY STATE THEATRE - NIGHT

Rose is busy at the buffet table Gregory is stunned and
exhilarated

ROSE
I was right The food is better

Shhhh Cool Keep it cool
GREGORY
(whispers excitedly)
We completely fooled then

ROSE
Still in a crowd though Would you
like to find a quiet spot

INT STAIRCASE NY STATE THEATRE NIGHT

Rose waits patiently with a white wine Gregory appears with
several dishes of hor doeurves

ROSE
Here he is - my hunter gatherer

GREGORY
They didnt have any more roast beef
with horse radish but I got some beef
skewers instead

ROSE
Fine Fine Sit down

Placing the dishes on the stairs Rose begins to prepare a
bite for herself - re-doing two hor doeurves by replacing
bits of one with another Gregory watches intently

ROSE (Contd)
The lettuce is always wilted on these
things and I cant stand cucumber

GREGORY
You love food dont you
ROSE
Why is that a problem
GREGORY
No not at all Could you make me one
like that
ROSE

Here have this one
She pops it into his mouth Gregory is unphased by the
intimacy of the gesture Rose smiles He stares at her Rose
giggles self-consciously

EXT NYC STREET - NIGHT
Rose and Gregory walk home after the concert

GREGORY
My favorite period is the turn of the
century Everyone having these
inflamed desires for people theyve
only sat alone in a parlor with
Holding hands becomes the most
intimate act

ROSE
And all those layers of clothing
theyve have to get through to even
make a move So erotic

Gregory laughs Rose smiles

GREGORY
Are you seeing anyone right now

Rose stops losing her smile Gregory is worried

GREGORY (Contd)
Whats wrong

ROSE
(protective)
What are we doing here

GREGORY
(shyly)
Well I Id like to get to know
you better Rose

ROSE
As what A friend An experiment

GREGORY
Do we have to label it

ROSE
Yes This isnt the turn of the
century Look youre a real nice guy
but Ive just come out of
something that -

GREGORY
So have I

ROSE
Well then we should definitely not go
any further

GREGORY
I dont agree I know the whole on
the rebound scenario and believe me
thats not what this is I dont want
what I had with her I want something
else I want everything youve been
talking about in that classroon

ROSE
But

GREGORY
There are no guarantees Rose Theres
no perfect science - its still all
depends on how a person sees it And
when I see you I see a woman unlike
any Ive known Your mind your
humor your passion for ideas your
courage to live by them

Rose is being swept off her feet

GREGORY (Contd)
What would happen if we put
everything else - the sex the
romantic illusions and put them
aside Got to real know each others
heart and soul like those knights
and ladies of the 12th century

ROSE
But they had passion for each They
just sacrificed it

GREGORY
They were ahead of the game because
we dont have that passion All we
have is respect and true affection
At least I do

Pause Rose finds it hard to breath Gregory worries

GREGORY (Contd)
Have I overstepped the boundaries

Speechless Rose shakes her head They walk side by side in
silence for a moment Until

GREGORY (Contd)
Rose
(they stop)
May I hold your hand then

Rose finds this so moving she can only nod Gregory takes
her hand and they walk past camera With their backs to us
we hear
ROSE
I want to hear about this woman Is
she dead

GREGORY
No shes lives in Paris

ROSE

GREGORY
«» I dont know what it is about
Jesse but after this last time I
made a decision I dont ever want to
feel that obsessive or lost over

ROSE

I thought you said you met her when-

Camera pans stadium crowd until we find Gregory and Rose in
deep conversation- oblivious to their surroundings

ROSE
- Anyway Alex was taking some
night classes and we got friendly
Its so stupid We used to sit in
coffee and share cigarettes Talk I
guess I built this whole fantasy of
him on those little things Like
sharing cigarettes It seemed like
such an intimate thing to do at the
time And I dont even smoke I
thought he was going to be ny
romance Then he met my sister and

Gregory is startled Rose sits back down calmly and continues
talking

ROSE (Contd)
Anyway theyre getting married now
and in a way Im glad because its
finally over I dont have to
fantasize anymore

Gregory nods Rose eats one of his french fries Pause

GREGORY
You know Ive always been fascinated
by peoples fascination with this
game I dont see the point of
playing a game in which you exert all
that effort to wind up at the same
place you started

Rose considers this but doesnt have an answer
ROSE
I dont know My father loved it We
had season tickets

Someone gets a hit and a run is scored

COMTI NUED

GREGORY
See Now he runs around and winds up
where he started - mathematically
this game has no point

ROSE
(lying) —
Well actually its about averages
I mean thats what makes it exciting

GREGORY
Averages

ROSE
Yeah see that scoreboard Everytime
a player comes up they flash that
three digit number Well thats the
players average how many times he
hit the ball in ratio to how many
times he stood up at bat Youre
dealing with several pitches coming
per time at bat And what a man can
do with these several pitches is
actually about pitting the man and
his skill against his average Its
man versus the numbers because if he
cant maintain or surpass his
average his contract gets cancelled
or he gets traded which is tantamount
to public humiliation

Intrigued Gregory pulls out a pad and pencil

GREGORY
Now which number is it

defiant sexuality She looks great (at least to this writer)

only a camisole that is slipping off her body as she stands
before a sunlit window The woman looks very similar to
Jessie Rose looks at the picture

ROSE
My God Shes beautiful

GREGORY

Shes my mother

(Rose is fascinated)
She lived in Europe after she left my
father and me We didnt hear
anything for years until an associate
of my fathers told us she was seen
with this Hungarian painter who was
starting to make a name for himself
He apparently took his work back to
Hungary with him and it wasnt until
the Eastern Bloc fell that his work
came to the states

ROSE
Wow Is she still alive

CONT I MUED

GREGORY
No She died of cancer during my

Seattle I liked him I went to all
the weddings We always spent her
last night as a free woman together
Thats what shed call it Id even
help her get dressed for the
ceremony I remember being
fascinated watching her put on make-
up Id watch this ritual over and
over until I knew exactly the moment
when she would reach for the eyeliner
or blend in her rouge

Rose listens seeing the wounded boy inside Gregory for the
first time

GREGORY (Contd)
But then every boy thinks theyre
mother is beautiful huh I come to
see it whenever they give a showing
of his work But Ive never
brought anyone before

tight She is falling in love with this man Gregory squeezes
her hand affectionately It is a tender moment until

she abruptly lets go of Gregorys hand - a gesture both she
and Gregory notice Alex kisses her hello Rose feels
embarrassed by her knee-jerk reaction

backroom to see the private stash

INT EMPTY BALLROOM NIGHT
In an empty hotel ballroom Rose sits by herself at a piano
Rose is playing a beautiful melody that echoes throughout the
empty space She is quietly crying as she hears the cheers
and laughter from the ballroom nearby

Behind her at the entrance - GREGORY APPEARS wearing a
tuxedo He quietly crosses to her

GREGORY
I didnt know you played piano

Rose is startled but hides her surprise with coolness

ROSE
Mother thought I needed something
growing up It was either piano or a
nose job What are you doing here

GREGORY
I came to apologize Rose I
wasnt really sick I was-
ROSE

I know It was Jessie I read
about it You dont have to do this
You certainly didnt have to dress up
to do this

GREGORY
Im sorry I wanted to be here for
you Are you all right

ROSE
Fine Like I said I dont have to
fantasize anymore
(adds)
About anyone

GREGORY
Rose I want to ask you something

ROSE
Gregory I think we should stop
seeing each -

GREGORY
Please Before you say that just
listen Because I can only say this
once Ive been sitting in my
apartment for days thinking it out so
dont feel as if Im being impulsive
Rose Im very very fond of
you When Im with you I feel ina
strange way as if - Im home I think
we I think were great together
And I think

ROSE
What are you saying

GREGORY

Well whatever it is Im saying it
wrong arent I This feeling you
have for Alex - I know it isnt the
same with me But I think we have
a kind of love that doesnt look like
anything else Its may be difficult
to pinpoint but I believe its there
We have a passion for knowledge and
for all that life can show us instead
of a passion for each other Buts
its real I know Ive never
mentioned it before but I had hoped
you could feel it In our own way I
believe we love other

(pause)
I think we should get married

Rose is stunned Her mind is racing

GREGORY (Contd)

I know what youre thinking We
havent had sex If this were 1900
that wouldnt be a question but since
its not all I can say is - its not
that important to me What we have
instead is I figure well just let
the rest of it happen naturally

(Rose is speechless)
Our experiences with love in the past
have left us miserable But perhaps
there was an order to it Perhaps it
led us here

ROSE
(pause then)
I know this is going to sound really
stupid but all I keep thinking of
is - how can I marry someone Ive
never even kissed

Gregory considers this then very slowly carefully sits
down beside Rose and gently kisses her

GREGORY
Any other considerations

ROSE
dust one question This is really
happening isnt it

relationship You said youve never
even been physical with hin

ROSE
I havent

HANNAH
(shocked)
And you said yes

ROSE
Yes He wants me He wants ME Maybe
not the way you and Claire were
wanted but wanted just the same

HANNAH
To cook and clean for him probably

ROSE
Well then it wont be much different
from living here

COMTI NUED

Hannah is insulted further Rose talks more intimately

For a moment Rose believes her But she fights back

ROSE (Contd)

Look I admit it isnt your average
marriage proposal but -

(vulnerably)
Nothing else is coming we both know
that - this may be it for me He says
he loves me in his way Maybe thats
all I can have

HANNAH

Youre in love with him arent you
ROSE

No I «
HANNAH

(strong curt)
Listen to me my darling daughter I
may have made a great many mistakes
when it came to you so I know you
have no respect for my opinion But
if you marry this man loving him
knowing he doesnt love you in the
same way - hell hate you for it I
know I was never in love with your
father that way I married him
because I knew he adored me and
always would but after a while that
adoration became insufferable to me
I couldnt stand him touching me
Every gesture had this pathetic plea
to love him in return and I simply
couldnt do it That he died first
and so early was his good fortune

ROSE
Poor daddy

HANNAH -
It was torture for me And its the
game torture youll be putting him
through

ROSE

Youll say anything to keep me here
wont you Youtre scared to death of
being alone and your jealous -
jealous of someone finding something
in me worth wanting You know you
cant compete with Claire but me A
man wanting me How ridiculous Well
ya know something mother - a man
does So you can just eat your
fucking heart out

(she rises)
Do you honestly believe that by
keeping me this spinster daughter
your beauty lasts any longer Youre
getting old mom And theres nothing
that I can do about it

Hannah is stung by the truth of Roses words as Rose exits

INT CITY HALL - DAY

Gregory and Rose both in suits stand in front of a judge
with witnesses Henry on one side and Doris on the other
Hannah is not present As the judge speaks Rose notices
things around the office that dont exactly fit a romantics
dream wedding An old Mr Coffee half full with dirty coffee
mugs and coffee grinds around a used filter Dirty grimy
windows looking out over gray office buildings with pigeons
perched on them The judges clerk a bored black woman
eating her bag lunch and reading a Danielle Steele book

Rose looks to Gregory who faces the judge with an immobile
expression She then looks over to Doris who offers a
sympathetic smile as if Doris understands Rose smiles back
gratefully She turns hoping shes making the right
choice

Gregory takes a breath and begins to undress He takes off
his tie and methodically folds it onto a tie rack where other
ties lay in prefect order He undoes his shirt puts it on a
hanger and buttons it up again fastidiously

He takes off his pants and folds them so the creases remain
in tact upon the hanger At that moment Rose speaks as she
opens the door

playing

HENRY

Have you tried making love

° GREGORY
Well thats just it I honestly
havent had the desire And what if
if it doesnt work Our relationship
was never based on that I love her
a great deal but

HENRY
Shes not Jess

GREGORY
That has nothing to do with it

HENRY
Your publisher called me He said he
spoke to you about a lecture tour in
London and Paris when your book gets
released next month Wanted to know
if I would be amenable to replacing
you for the rest of the semester

GREGORY
(flustered)
I know I havent said anything
because I havent decided if I want
to do it or not

HENRY
He said the offer came from their
overseas counterpart Beaux Art
Publishing Isnt that one of the
companies Jessies new husband owns

Gregory doesnt answer Obviously this secret has been
influencing him Henry begins with what seems like a non-
sequitur

HENRY (Contd)
Do you know that in the past two
years Ive been with eleven
different women most of them half my
age Not one lasted longer than two
months Some didnt last the night
Not one of them had a sense of humor
I understood

HENRY (contd)

One girl actually thought A FAREWELL
TO ARMS was a new diet book I went
to my gym the other day and saw the
most incandescent creature climbing
a Stairmaster Even her sweat was
perfectly distributed about her body
I thought she was staring at me the
whole time until I realized she had
head phones on and was looking at MTV
on a monitor behind my head I went
into the locker room and walked my
naked 56 year old body through a room
of Apollos and sat in a steam room
where I was propositioned by a bald
man with hair on his shoulders It
was the highlight of my day

INT APARTMENT NIGHT

Rose is in the kitchen preparing two glasses of wine She
wears a negligee thats flimsier than anything weve seen her
in She checks her face in the reflection of the microwave
then breathes a deep sigh

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Gregory sits up in his bed watching a ballgame He too looks

anxious as Rose enters with a tray and two glasses He

to cover his anxiety with conversation

GREGORY
I uhI have the game on for you

ROSE
Oh well we dont have to watch

GREGORY
Doesnt matter to me

ROSE
I bought that wine Henry recommended

tries

GREGORY
Oh before bed I dont know Rose
Ill wake up with head pressure

ROSE
No its white - you said only red
does that

GREGORY

All right One glass

Rose offers him a glass then sets the tray on her bed
taking her glass She stands as they sip

GREGORY (Contd)

Mmm good Fruity I dont
normally like fruity but this is
good

Gregory realizes shes standing He asks gently

GREGORY (Contd)
Do you want to sit down

ROSE
(acting surprised)
Oh OK

Rose walks around to the other side of Gregorys bed and sits
down next to him leaning up against a pillow They both feel
immediately uncomfortable though pretending they dont They
sip in silence each body rigid and detached from the other
They both have their eyes on the game but neither is
watching Rose decides to make her move She sets her glass
on the nightstand then scoots herself up higher on the
pillow Gregory keeps his eyes straight ahead

ROSE (Contd)
That wine made me warn

GREGORY
I could lower the thermostat

ROSE
No its OK

Pause They return to the TV Rose musters all her courage
and begins to unravel the tie that keeps her nightgown
fastened She nervously loosens it enough to open the front
revealing her cleavage and the outline of her breasts

Gregory knowing full well what she has done keeps his eyes
on the set PAUSE No one moves until -

AT EXACTLY THE SAME MOMENT

Rose moves to give Gregory a kiss just as Gregory turns away
to place his glass on the other nightstand Roses face butts
Gregorys shoulder which jolts him forward knocking over
the wine glass He tries to retrieve it but in a split
second knocks over the lamp instead and throwing the room
into darkness The only illumination comes from the TV

GREGORYROSE
Im sorry NoMy faultSorry

Pause Gregory faces her and asks apprehensively yet bluntly

GREGORY
Do do you want to

ROSE
Dont say it

GREGORY

(logically)

Well maybe if we undress and get into
bed

ROSE

(acting surprised)
Oh all right

Then stiffly turn away from each other and begin to disrobe
Then each slips beneath the covers and lay next to each
other looking up at the ceiling Both are clearly nervous
and apprehensive They turn on their sides to face each

other The lovemaking that follows is precisely choreographed
in beats

- They begin with passionless mechanical kisses Neither one
touching the other Their feelings in check

Rose begins to feel something first She plants a kiss on
Gregory that lingers a bit longer Gregory keeps his eyes
open as Rose begins to lose herself a little

- Gregory feels it is his move and he chooses to stroke her
hair and face Rose receives this with some self
consciousness

Rose then grabs his hand and pulls him toward her as she
raps her arms around him and kisses him firmly and
passionately

We can tell Gregory is still a little stiff but this
doesnt hinder Rose She begins to ravage him pushing on his
back and kissing his face neck and shoulders Gregory begins
to have trouble breathingRose kisses him again on the
mouth

- Gregory returns the kisses - BUT THERE IS NO PASSION Hes
thinking too hard - refusing to let go and open up that part
of him Rose works even harder rubbing him touching hin
kissing his body But Gregory gives very little in the way of
surrender or response

Rose pulls Gregory back on top of her and he tries to
enter She continues touching kissing and hugging but WE CAN
SEE THAT SHE IS CRYING knowing that he is not responding

- Gregory working at feeling something finds that he
cannot He suddenly stops trying He pulls himself off of
Rose who quickly raises the sheet over to her body She
wants to die Gregory searches for an explanation

GREGORY
Im so sorry Rose Im

Rose turns away from him and starts to cry silently He
doesnt know what to say He feels very badly

GREGORY (Contd)
Rose

Rose hides her face filled with hurt and shame

ROSE
Please I just want to go to sleep

GREGORY
Rose Listen What we have
Ive never had with a woman what I
share with you The way I feel
about myself with you the way I

Rose enters and shuts the door slowly She takes in the room
for a moment then removes her coat She sits down at her
vanity She looks at herself in the mirror coldly

HANNAH enters in a silk robe and stands in the doorway She
looks old As if since Roses departure her own age has
suddenly advanced itself She says coldly

HANNAH
I have plans tomorrow so if your
things are coming you should tell the
doorman to accept them

Rose doesnt even flinch or look in her direction She
speaks in a deadened tone void of any sentiment or emotion
as stares into the mirror and remembers

ROSE
When I was a little girl you used to
tell me to sleep with my index finger
pushing my nose up so it wouldnt
droop

HANNAH
I did not

ROSE
Yes you did Its funny what mothers
forget and what daughters remember
You even suggested I scotch tape my
nose up so Id be more comfortable
You told me if I was fat no one
would ever look at me and smile And
the funny thing is I would have
never known I wasnt beautiful if it
wasnt for those things All those
hours I wasted wishing I looked like
someone else All that time

HANNAH

Hed probably call to ask for
permission first I know this may be
hard to believe but you mean a great

A great deal Thats what I am

There are some men who have been
known to come to their senses about
this sort of thing

ROSE

Name one

You men have it made Love is the
ultimate unequal opportunity You -
guys hire and fire with complete
discrimination I hate love It makes
you lose your sense of irony It
wouldnt be as hard having a man
leave you if he didnt take your
sense of humor with him

HENRY
I think men are men because we dont
have the guts to be women You know
why I sleep with girls

HENRY (contd)
Because they are the perfect
symbiosis of all that is possible and
all that is mysterious Life runs
through them at light speed As I get
older I realize Im not so much a
lech as I am a vampire

The plastic surgery

(Rose shakes her head)
Well I want you to know that if you
decided to go through with it - its
my gift I11 pay for everything

ROSE
Why

HANNAH
What do you mean why Im your
mother I want to do this for you I
think its a terrific idea Get rid
of the old ‘Start fresh Get a whole
new outlook on things And whether or
not this husband of yours come home
wanting to continue or not youll

ROSE
Why cant I do all that without
surgery

HANNAH
(stumped)
Well I suppose you can I just
want you to know I supportive of this
in case you decide thats what you
want

Hannah feels very motherly Rose smiles seeing this silly
woman who once could hurt her so deeply as something
endearing almost innocently unconscious

HANNAH (Contd)
After you left I rearranged all the
closets and I came across some old
clothes of your fathers I found
this I thought youd get a kick out
of it

Hannah pulls a photograph out of her purse Rose looks over

Your father adored you But you know
that He never thought of Claire
Only you Especially in the early
years after Claire was born And
after a while even I didnt
occupy his thoughts so much

Because I tortured him if he didnt
But if I hadnt

He thought you were the most
beautiful thing hed ever seen I

baby before you came Having you was
quite an experience for him

I may be a complete monster of a
mother but that doesnt mean I

child You dont know what to do

JESSIE
I have to admit Im surprised Youve
never kept me at a distance this long
before Is it because of your
marriage
(Greg nods)
I didnt know it was that serious

GREGORY
Isnt yours

JESSIE

Ha No No it never was Two months
after the ceremony he informed me he
spends every summer in Greece with
this Polish ballet dancer Dont be
so surprised Europeans have a
different way of looking at marriage
Not that I entirely disagree with it

GREGORY
You dont seem happy

JESSIE

I cant be a hypocrite But it did
give me a taste of what it could be
like With the right person Ive
realized something funny Greg I was
so worried about winding up a wife
with nothing but memories And all
these years of living my life in
short unconnected perfect moments
have left me with nothing but
memories I dont want perfection
anymore

(genuine)
I want something thatll last

Gregory is truly taken by her Yet he doesnt know whether

complete After confronting her

see with a ruthlessness for truth all
that a woman is - loving jealous
timid ambitious beautiful and
horrifying - and rid herself of the
fantasies of heaven to live
authentically and freely
