MUSIC--CREDITS ROLL
EXT PARKNG LOT - DAY

RICK DAYNE white 50’s parks and gets out of his ‘94 Buick
carrying a travel mug a brown bag lunch and three different
newspapers He wears jeans and a corduroy blazer and his
expression is a mix of cynicism and fatigue He’s not
without passion but you gotta dig deep He walks toward a
building whose entrance sign reads DELAWARE STATE JOURNAL

INT NEWS ROOM - STATE JOURNAL OFFICES - DAY

Rick walks through the bustling news floor nodding hello to
the occasional colleague In the back corner is a dangling
cardboard sign THE BOYS OF OP-ED The cubicles here are a
little nicer Rick taps awake his computer as MATT BARNES
another op-ed writer pokes his head around the partition

MATT BARNES
Didn’‘t think you were comin’ in this
morning

RICK
Forgot my research

MATT BARNES
On what

RICK
The prison reform thing My annual rage
against the machine

MATT BARNES
Sean gonna run that this year

RICK
He runs it every year It’s his
concession to me for taking my job

MATT BARNES
Big heart small dick

RICK
Yeah well he knows my last name so he
figures it’s good luck

MATT BARNES
That-a-way to think about it

( )

Rick glances through a folder of printed-out articles

MATT BARNES (contd)
Is this the inmate-website guy

RICK
Yeah

MATT BARNES
He write well

RICK
(off the articles)
--He’s all right

SEAN (0S)
What’s up fellas’

Rick turns to see SEAN 30’s the op-ed page editor whos
immensely sure of himself but tends to give Rick the deserved
respect of an elder

RICK
What’s up Sean
SEAN
You headed out to Smyrna
RICK
Yeah
SEAN

Good stuff I love how you track these
guys down Old school man old school

RICK
That’s me

SEAN
You hear Schwarzenegger’s talking about a
major state prison overhaul

RICK
No I didn’t--

SEAN
AP had it last night The guy’s got

vision

RICK
He also fondles women

( )

SEAN
Hey there but for the grace of God you
know what I’m saying

MATT BARNES
No Sean we don’t

SEAN
(leaving)
Call me later Rick I want you to doa
piece on the Soil Conference next week

INT LOBBY - STATE JOURNAL OFFICES - DAY

Rick exits the elevator and heads for the door throwing a
glance to a glass-encased black and white photo portrait of
a distinguished man in his 60s We glimpse the attached
nametag MELVIN DAYNE PUBLISHER 1941-1966

As Rick passes the front desk he nods in greeting to the
SECURITY GUARD who smiles back

SECURITY GUARD
Have a good one Mr Dayne

EXT VISITOR’S ENTRANCE - DELAWARE CORRECTIONAL CENTER - DAY
Rick’s Buick pulls into the mostly empty lot He gets out
surveying the low-lying sprawling facility its two guard
towers its six miles of surrounding razor wire
INT SECURITY CHECKPOINT THREE - CORRECTIONAL CENTER - DAY
Rick being patted down by two bored CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS
RICK
You woulda thought they’d find anything
bad the first two checkpoints
CORRECTIONAL OFFICER 1
It’s death row man if you were a
killer you’d take away our fun
Rick looks at the guy expressionless
CORRECTIONAL OFFICER 2
‘Sides if you’re goin’ to see McBain
youre the one who should be worried

dude’1ll outsmart you to death

RICK
Yeah but is he nice

( )

CORRECTIONAL OFFICER 1
He actually kinda is

INT PRISON VISITING ROOM - DAY

Rick sits opposite DARIUS MCBAIN black mid-30’s two-inch
afro orange prison garb He’s earnest confident and
intense able to swing from street vernacular to “white talk”
without seeming false The kind of guy you can’t take your
eyes off

DARIUS
I was out walking I was high I heard a
gunshot distinct as hell about a block
away So I ran in that direction

RICK
Why

DARIUS
‘Cause I was 17
(pause)
I turned the corner saw the body And
I’m thinking I knew Ronny did it that it
musta been a deal gone wrong because it’s
his block and his time of night I pick

up the gun--
RICK

Why would he have dropped it
DARIUS

‘Cause he panicked
RICK

Ronny the kind of guy to panic
DARIUS

Yep
RICK

Then what
DARIUS

I ditch the gun turn the corner run
smack into a patrol car responding to
shots fired

RICK
Shots

DARIUS
Shot

( )

RICK
Next thing you know you’re in jail

DARIUS
No Next thing I know I’m staring out
the window of the cruiser wondering if I
should say the name Ronny

RICK
You shouldve

DARIUS
I shouldve But I thought--You don’t ID
your friends that I didn’t have motive
the weapon was gone I was a juvie with
respectable folksI thought there was
no way I’d go down for it

RICK
So why’d you confess

DARIUS
Because they got to me Eight guys in
rotation for 36 hours no sleep high on
soda sugar no food no lawyer--I was 17

ANGLE on a bored CO in the corner of the room

RICK
And at the trial

DARIUS
I retracted but my lawyer didn’t want me
on the stand the jury was eight white
with four black who thought they were
white I had no alibi A white judges
kid got shot They were on a warpath

RICK
Id have been too

DARIUS
Listen at the range at which that kid
was shot there would’ve been spatter on
my clothes and powder residue on my hands-
-neither of which were

RICK
What about the hairs

DARIUS
Two negro hairs that were consistent with
mine but never tested for DNA

(MORE)

( )

DARIUS (contd)
(pause quiet)
I went to church two days before the
murder was president of my class a 37
GPA I’m not a murderer and I don’t
deserve to die

Rick sits back a light smirk on his face

DARIUS (contd)
(lightening up)
But you were asking me about prison
reform

RICK
That’s true

DARIUS
Not a lot of people browse prison
websites

RICK
I do an article every year--

DARIUS
I know

RICK
I thought yours would be a fresh
perspective

DARIUS
It ain’t gonna change things anyway

RICK
Probably not

DARIUS
(Darius considers him)
You read my idea about having welfare
moms teaching inmates how to read

RICK
Yeah I did

DARIUS
You like it

RICK
It’s a little far-fetched

DARIUS
Why

( )

RICK
Because I would bet that half of the
welfare moms are also illiterate

DARIUS
It’d say it’s 50-50 meaning you match up
whoever can read with whoever can’t
Either way Moms get their 550 an hour
prisoners get their 50 cents

RICK
And everyone else learns how to read

DARIUS
That’s right So instead of people
hating welfare queens they respect ‘em
for gettin’ a job educating a thug

RICK
I’1l rush to the state house and run it
up the flagpole

DARIUS
You think it’s a joke man but every
time an uneducated inmate gets outta
here guess where they’re headed

RICK
Arbys

DARIUS
Your fucking house

Rick looks at him half-smiling Darius returns it
INT RICK’S BUICK - DAY

Rick drives through rural Delaware a bemused smile still on
his face as he listens to country music

INT RICK AND KATYA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Rick sits on a kitchen counter sipping Merlot talking with
his girlfriend KATYA--late 30’s hip--who’s nibbling Weight
Watchers and keeping an eye on the late-night news If Rick
is old school media she’s very new

KATYA
Nice guy

RICK
He actually is

( )

KATYA
Why ‘cause he says he’s not guilty

RICK
More because he’s smart

KATYA
Smart doesn’t mean nice Rick

RICK
What does it mean

KATYA
It means able to make guilt seem like
innocence

RICK

The guy’s scheduled to die in six months
and he’s in there posting articles about
prison reform

KATYA
Was he good-looking

RICK
What’s the difference

KATYA
I take that as a yes

RICK
Why does that--

KATYA
It doesn’t it just means your leftist
ex-hippie guilt has got the best of you
again

RICK
Wow

KATYA
My point is that prisons are full of cute
killers with GED’s Our job as
journalists is to see past that

Rick looks at her with a smile and shakes his head
RICK

For someone claiming to be liberal you
exude a lot of antipathy

( )

KATYA
(with a smile)
That actually comes from living with a
liberal as opposed to being one

RICK
So you’re saying I’m more liberal than
you

KATYA

Youre like a poster boy for the Sixties
Which doesn’t mean I don’t love you

RICK
It just means you’re not ready to marry
me

She gives him a loving smile

KATYA
Yet

RICK
Yet

KATYA

(keeping it light)
Let’s put it this way there’s a
difference between media-savvy liberal
activism suitable to the 21st century
and passively wishing it were still 1969

RICK
Well maybe that’s why this guy interests
me He’s my way back in

KATYA
(sweet genuine)
Good
RICK
Good

INT SECURITY CHECKPOINT THREE - CORRECTIONAL CENTER - DAY
Rick getting patted down again by the same two guards

CORRECTIONAL OFFICER 1
Back for more with Malcolm X

RICK
Someone’s got to

( )

CORRECTIONAL OFFICER 2
He tell you about his prison health care
idea

RICK

CORRECTIONAL OFFICER 2
Ask him it’s actually kinda cool

EXT PRISON YARD - DAY

Rick and Darius stand in a sliver of sunlight in a tiny yard
with high walls a prison tower looming above a burly CO
stands by the door

RICK
I’m surprised they let us out here

DARIUS
Half-hour a day for good behavior If
you’re extra good they let you go in
two’s Not bad for guys who wanna kill
me

RICK
--I wanted to ask about your DNA test
DARIUS
Huge backlog Mine’s not due up until

RICK
And yet your execution date--
DARIUS
August ‘07
RICK
Is your lawyer working on that
DARIUS
Theoretically
RICK

(Rick nods writing on a pad)
I’m also supposed to ask you about your
prison health care plan

DARIUS

(a prideful smile)
Robbie tell you about that

( )

RICK
Yeah

DARIUS
Well I haven’t posted it yet ‘cause it’s
not perfected but basically we got a
whole generation of 3-strike prisoners
about to turn geriatric and if we don’t
figure something out it’ll fuck every
state budget in the country

RICK
So what’s your idea

DARIUS
A 40 cent per gallon tax hike on gas for
cars that cost more than 40-thousand

dollars
RICK
That’s your plan
DARIUS
Yeah “40 at 40” Works out to roughly

a billion a year which’1ll fund a prison
health care system based on the Canadian
one to be used as a test program for how
a national kids plan could work in which
case you expand it to 70 at 20

(pause)
I got the details laid out on my
computer

Rick smiles unimpressed or at least not showing it
INT PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY

Darius stands now shackled and about to be ushered back to
his cell Another guard waits to escort Rick out

DARIUS
By the way I liked the article

RICK
Oh Thanks Wasn’t sure you’d read it

DARIUS
I read everything Rick

RICK
Right

( )

Rick nods
leans ina

They watch
EXT FRONT

Rick climb

DARIUS
You got all my major points in but you
took out the curse words

RICK
Yeah well--

DARIUS
I liked it Made me think there’s a way
to communicate in this country after all
Beneath all the bullshit That there are
people out there walking around trying
to understand each other

unsure what to say but sort of flattered Darius
nd lowers his voice

DARIUS (contd)
And if you ever wanna write another one
I think you should About my case
(simple inescapably honest)
Because I didn’t shoot that kid I swear
to God above Rick I did not shoot him

each otherbefore the guard guides Darius away
STEPS - STATE COURTHOUSE - DAY

waving hi to a man in a 3-piece suit going the opposite way

female CLERK hands him a large cardboard container

Youve been a wise-ass since the day I
met you
RICK

Which was 114 years ago
CLERK

goddam chicken

( )

RICK
Good while you’re springing around would
you look up on little your computer
whether there’s a Ronald Jackson in our
country’s wonderful prison system

CLERK
Why

RICK
Because I have a crush on him

She blows a kiss and works the computer as Rick pulls a file
and opens it to a mug shot Darius glaring at us from 17
years ago wide-eyed and scared He moves onto a document

RICK (contd)
Did you know that inaccurate hair
comparison is a factor in one-third of
DNA-overturned convictions

CLERK
You ask me they’re all drunks

RICK
I do love you Delores

CLERK
(off computer)
Ronald Jackson Maryland 25-to-life
for rapemurder

RICK

Does that mean his blood’s in the system
Off Delores nodding--

on the same subject twice

RICK
Not it’s not--

KATYA
(to Jane)
But it was good no

JANE
It was very good

ROY
I agree I saw it too--

JANE
It’s funny my firm’s been approached
several times by non-profits about the
backlog of DNA testing

ROY
It’s a serious problem--

RICK
Theres over 400 cases waiting for re-
test and only one in-state lab

JANE
Are the right people reading your stuff

RICK
Actually--yeah The state’s attorney
called me two hours ago He’s jumping
Darius’s case to the front of the pile

KATYA

that he doesn’t look like a prick

Pause Jane and Katya digging Rick’s sexy integrity

glass the others follow

Jane

INT SEAN’S OFFICE - STATE JOURNAL - DAY
Sean elated sits at his desk Rick standing before him

SEAN

Ronny Jackson’s bloodwork matches the
hairs found on the victim’s clothes--

RICK
Which they still have--

SEAN
Which of course they still have this is
Delaware Rick we don’t lose evidence--

RICK
Where’s Texas when you need it--

SEAN
But get this part They call the prison
in Maryland where he is and tell him
“They just found your hair on a 1990
murder victim’s clothes” and two hours
later the guy asks to see the warden and
confesses to the whole fucking thing

( )

RICK
Really

SEAN
I kid you not it’s phenomenal

RICK
So what happens--

SEAN
It’s on the governor’s desk with a
request for McBain’s immediate release
which they think could happen It seems
the gov’s been reading your articles
Rick takes this in trying to conceal his pride
SEAN (contd)
You’re a dragon-slayer Rick I’m putting
you up for the fucking Pulitzer

RICK
Keep it in your pants Sean--

SEAN
And no longer can I give you shit for
dating younger women You’re a beast

SOUND OF A DOORBELL--

INT FRONT HALL - RICK AND KATYA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

MILES DAVIS slides from a speaker as Katya dressed
fashionably answers the front door Darius is there in
slacks and a sweater as is OPAL OWENS black mid-30’s a
woman who knows her mind well and isn’t afraid to speak it

KATYA

Hey Darius

DARIUS
Hi Rick This is Opal

RICK
(extending his hand)
Great to meet you

OPAL
(barely shaking his hand)
You too

Katya shuts the door and the four of them stand in awkward
silence for a moment And then

RICK
C’mon in--I‘1ll get you a drink

INT LIVING ROOM - RICK AND KATYA’S HOUSE - LATER

Opal Darius and Rick sit as Katya offering around a plate
of hors d’ouevres talks excitedly

KATYA
I think it’s a no-brainer Get a book
deal Memoir creative non-fiction
people eat that stuff up--

DARIUS
I dunno--

KATYA
You don’t wanna write a book

DARIUS
About what

( )

KATYA
Your experience getting massively screwed
by the powers-that-be It’ll be the
story of our entire justice system

RICK
She’s got a point With the way you
write we’d see it from the inside like
never before

KATYA
I read your letter-to-the-editor in
response to Rick’s article you’re good

DARIUS
Thanks It’s the Irish in me

KATYA
Hah Here spanakopita

DARIUS
Sure--

KATYA
They’re frozen I mean not anymore ‘cause
I nuked ‘em but they’1ll hold you over
‘til dinner
She smilingly offers one to Opal who declines Beat

KATYA (contd)
So what do you think Opal

OPAL
About what

KATYA
About what Darius should do

OPAL
I dunno

RICK
You think he should write a book

OPAL
If he wants

KATYA
--What do you do Opal

OPAL
Nothing

( )

KATYA
Youre unemployed
OPAL
Nope
KATYA
So you don’t like your job
OPAL
I don’t have a job
DARIUS
Why’re you giving them a hard time
OPAL
I’m not
DARIUS

(to others)
She works off the books babysits--

OPAL
Deals drugs--

DARIUS
No you don’t--

OPAL
How do you know

DARIUS
Because you don’t deal drugs--

OPAL
Yes I do--

DARIUS
What kind

OPAL
I dunno

DARIUS
(to others)
She doesn’t deal drugs

KATYA
It’s fine with me if she does--

DARIUS
You don’t deal drugs

( )

Silence a

off Opal

OPAL
Whatever you say Darius

KATYA
--So you don’t deal drugs

OPAL
I guess not

moment

DARIUS

Lemme explain Opal married me ‘cause
she was honoring our past but nobody
expected her to stay home and sew socks
For me it was just being able to say I
had a wife Most inmates don’t get that
and guys on death row--

(shaking his head)
Shes a remarkable woman

OPAL

I have a boyfriend
DARIUS

She likes to say that
OPAL

It’s true
DARIUS

It’s true but it’s not good Opal ‘cause
Jackie told me what he does and that
shit’s no good I’m telling you

(pause to others)
I love this woman She makes me a better
man

(she essentially ignores him

To the others )
She don’t love me back yet but she will

expressionless Darius turns to them

DARIUS (contd)
How long you two been together

RICK
Three years

KATYA
Three and a half actually

( )

Rick looks at her surprised at her accuracy She smiles
back genuinely Darius and Opal watch it’s a nice moment

INT DINING ROOM - RICK AND KATYA’S HOUSE - LATER

Rick Katya Opal and Darius sit around a candlelit table
Rick is boring the shit out of Opal and Katya

RICK
The thing about Delaware offshore wind-
energy potential is that it’s doable

KATYA
Anyone want more fish

DARIUS
Thatd be great--

RICK
Because the fact is the best available
wind resources just happen to be in the
mid-continental plains of each of the
major continents ie 20 miles off the
Delaware shoreline

DARIUS
I hear you--

RICK
Right So my question is Why aren’t
we doing it

KATYA
Are we sure this is interesting

RICK
Yes--Darius wrote an essay about prisons
using alternative fuel sources

KATYA
Well then maybe Opal and I can just get
drunk--

DARIUS

See the problem is aesthetics
Americans have this relationship with
their oceans that’s hard to violate

RICK
It’s emotional--

( )

The others

DARIUS
Profoundly fucking emotional but it’s
messing us up ‘cause we’re also talking
wave energy tidal energy aquaculture--

RICK
So what do we do

DARIUS
You gotta come up with a campaign to
convince people that a buncha’ wind
turbines sitting out at sea is actually a
work of art Which they are--

RICK
I agree--

DARIUS
America has zero offshore farms and
Europe’s got hundreds of ‘em and
everyone knows that the French are more
fashion-conscious than we are It’s just
a matter of re-shaping perception

are just looking at Darius

KATYA

How’d you come up with that
DARIUS

Books
KATYA

(serving fish)
You should come on my show Youre like
a walking human-interest story

OPAL
He’s like a guy who can talk out of his
ass and make his lips move

DARIUS
(pause simple)
You don’t think I tell the truth

OPAL
When the fuck’ve you ever seen a fucking
windmill

DARIUS
Never like I just said ‘cept in a book

( )

OPAL
So that’s what I call talkin’ out your
ass
DARIUS

You don’t think books are real

OPAL
Not enough for you to talk like that

DARIUS
I gotta go sit in a field in Minnesota to
have an opinion about turbines

OPAL
Hmm hmm

DARIUS
Do I gotta have seen Jesus to believe in
God

OPAL
If you’re gonna preach about Him then all
I can say is I hope you’ve seen Him or
spoke with Him or at least motherfucking
heard Him on the street

DARIUS
All right then Opal That’s your
opinion and I won’t get in its way

OPAL
Good

DARIUS
(pause to others)
Now you see why I love this girl

INT TV STUDIO - “THIS WEEK IN DELAWARE” —- DAY

The set for an informal Sunday morning TV talk show--a coffee

table and
a tie and

two chairs one of which is occupied by Darius in
jacket and the other by Katya As cast and crew

prepare Katya leans over to Darius so that only he can hear

KATYA
You doing OK

DARIUS
I guess

( )

KATYA
You are you’re doing great now in this
segment just let go and have fun

CREW MEMBER
And we’re on in 5-4-3-

CU on Darius a slight deer-in-the-headlights look as he
takes in the camera the studio the crew--

CREW MEMBER (contd)
2--and go

KATYA

(polished into the camera)
Weve been talking to recently-exonerated
prison inmate Darius McBain about the
corrections system in this country--

(to him)
--but I’d like to switch now and ask you
a little about how you landed in the
middle of that system to begin with

Darius takes a moment to gather himself before responding

DARIUS
Well I ah grew up in Wilmington on
Rosemont Avenue Went to Howard High I
was an only child My dad was a postal
administrator my mom ran a little
greeting card service out of our house

KATYA
Your mother made greeting cards
DARIUS
That’s right
KATYA
So you’re talking about a pretty solid
family
DARIUS

We had a nice car but no savings

KATYA
So then what happened--to put you near
the crime that night

DARIUS
I screwed up In with the wrong crowd

( )

KATYA
Do you regret it

DARIUS
Of course I mean the confession was
coerced but I shouldn’t have been
anywhere near that interrogation room
that night

KATYA
Because--

DARIUS
Because kids know very early on how the
world works and it’s our job to make
sure we navigate it well

ANGLE on Rick watching Darius’s image on a monitor behind
the cameras enjoying the show

KATYA
How does the world work in your opinion

DARIUS
Meaning--

KATYA
For example--does our country’s welfare
system work

Darius looks at her blankly for a moment then glances at a
cameraman in mid-yawn Pause And then

DARIUS
I’m not a big fan

KATYA
And why is that

DARIUS
Because it’s more helpful to whites than
it is to blacks
(her eyebrows lift waiting)
That kind of guilt-driven urge--as
profoundly as it might be felt--takes
away our power

KATYA
How

DARIUS
By killing our desire to live

( )

KATYA
Yes but how

DARIUS

(again a pausebefore

deciding to let it rip)
Think about your average female welfare
recipient She gets free housing food
stamps healthcare daycare--no wonder
she doesn’t get married she’s better off
single Her energy goes into finagling
instead of making a better life

ANGLE on Rick his smile fading quick--

KATYA
And that’s the state’s fault

DARIUS
No but it’s the state that engenders it

KATYA
Does this mean you’re also against
affirmative action

DARIUS
Partially--

KATYA
You don’t think the effects of slavery
still resonate

DARIUS
Yes but they don’t beat out ignorance
lack of self-confidence and poor reality-
assessment

KATYA
(pause a smile)
So what’s your solution Mr McBain You
can’t complain if you don’t have answers

DARIUS
I think it starts with a question How do
we re-imagine the intervention Because
it’s more than just some white kid losing
his assembly line job to a black kid

ANGLE on the CAMERAMAN smiling--

DARIUS (contd)
Money and energy need to be redirected to
where the problem starts

(MORE )

( )

DARIUS (contd)
we need toilet paper and pencils in grade
school a lot more than we need some high-
yella black jerk in law school

ANGLE on Rick turning away with a wince--

DARIUS (contd)
I say legislate SAT prep courses in the
ghetto mandate a corporate matching
donation to a rec center for every
campaign contribution in this country

ANGLE on Darius in the monitor hitting stride--

DARIUS (contd)
Require tobacco companies to replace all
those nigger-aimed cigarette ads with
billboards of Zora Neale Hurston quotes
Put the money where the mouth is--that’s
my answer

Darius stops then nods humbly at the cameraas Katya
regards him with a mischievous smilebefore turning to us

KATYA
I’ve been talking to Delaware native
Darius McBain I’m Katya Braunne join
us again next week for This Week in
Delaware

ANGLE on the camera’s RED LIGHT going out as Katya Rick and

I received a legal pardon sir Another
man admitted to the crime

JIM CRAGEN

No--

don’t want any trouble

JIM CRAGEN
You don’t want trouble
DARIUS
No
JIM CRAGEN

You want a hug

--I’m not sure what--

JIM CRAGEN
Should I hug you

DARIUS
Why would you
JIM CRAGEN

until he is really quite close But then stops Pause

JIM CRAGEN

Does that make us all feel better

A deafening silenceand then Darius speaks softly

DARIUS
I did not kill your son sir
JIM CRAGEN
Of course you did
DARIUS
No--
JIM CRAGEN

Everything about you did Everything
about you ripped out his heart But I’m
not mad I’m not even sad I just
wanted to look at you
Pause Darius slowly gently tries to reach out to him--

JIM CRAGEN (contd)
Dont touch me

DARIUS
OK--

JIM CRAGEN
Don’t evertouch me

Darius remains still Rick watches stunned After a
moment Jim turns to go speaking quietly

JIM CRAGEN (contd)
I hope you die

He begins to walk awayand then

( )

DARIUS
I knew Patrick

Jim stops but doesn’t turn around

DARIUS (contd)
From earlier that year He’d been coming
around for several months So I knew him
(pause very gentle)
He was a good kid sir I remember his
face Lit up like a lamp when he smiled
He was a very sweet kid

continues walking away Silence

SEAN
Can we talk for a sec’

EXT MAIN AVENUE - WILMINGTON - DAY

Sean and Rick stroll down the avenue each sipping coffee
from paper cups Sean eats a scone

SEAN
You know I have enormous respect for not
only who your grandfather was but for
what you’ve done here especially
recently

RICK
Thanks--

SEAN
But here’s the thing You’re blurring
the lines

RICK
Which lines

( )

SEAN
The ones delineating objectivity Four
articles on one guy is two too many
arranging his talk show appearances--not
good and lending him money particularly
the four-figure kind is a definite
“journalistic-integrity” no-no Rick and
I know you know this--

RICK
Who said I lent him money
SEAN
Did you
RICK
Yes
SEAN

Then it doesn’t matter who the point is
it has to stop or else the paper the one
your grandfather used to run gets
accused of having a major fucking agenda

RICK
I write for op-ed--

SEAN
Doesn’‘t matter we still come off as
liberal softies who only champion
underdogs

RICK
They tend to need championing

SEAN
Yes but not unconditional love Let the
non-profits do that Our job is
impartial truth-telling

RICK
Oh c’mon--we’re fucking owned by Gannett
We’re the poster-boy for corporate bias

SEAN
Is that what your granddad would say

RICK
He died a year after they sold to
Gannett Sean and with him went any
pretense of objective fucking journalism--

( )

SEAN
That’s not true--

RICK
Of course it is and even if it weren’t it
wouldn’t matter because no one reads
papers anymore anyway

Sean stops looks at him a weary smile
SEAN
What do you want me to say Rick It’s
still inappropriate
Beat Then Rick just turns and walks away

then the prosecutors thing last week
where I think you lit the place on fire

DARIUS
Thank you--

SMATHERS
You’ve a got a great way with words it’s
what we’re short on these days

RICK
(to Darius)
Dons a lawyer

SMATHERS
Otherwise known as a bullshitter

( )

RICK
A bullshitter in pursuit of truth

SMATHERS
Artful bullshit--as we call it at the
club I also saw you on the show
Darius the Sunday show--

RICK

This Week In Delaware--
SMATHERS

You were fantastic--
DARIUS

Thank you--
SMATHERS

Then I went back and read your articles

SMATHERS
Well I think that’s why we’re here

No--

SMATHERS

DARIUS
Youre a lawyer

SMATHERS

consider running for state senator

SMATHERS
I’m far from fucking Have a nut

DARIUS
(to Rick)
Does he know who I am

SMATHERS
Of course I do--

DARIUS
Oh so that’s part of the--

SMATHERS
Part of the what--part of the reason I’d
want you to run

DARIUS
Yeah--
SMATHERS
Yes yeah it’s part of the reason--
DARIUS
Why
SMATHERS

Because it qualifies you to speak to a
portion of this state’s residents for
whom life is not a cakewalk Your life
hasn’t been a cakewalk Darius and yet
you never gave up You’re not--

(to Rick)
How do I say this--

RICK
He’s a gifted public speaker--

SMATHERS

You’re an inherently gifted speaker your
opinions happen to coincide with and
actually elucidate a growing trend within
the state democratic apparatus in which
were seeking to own our own identity in
juxtaposition to the radical left and the
centrist right Am I--do I need to say
this or am I right to assume you know it

DARIUS
I don’t think I know it--

( )

SMATHERS
Your instincts are dead-on
(lowering voice)
You call it like you see it Darius
It’s what we need

RICK
--Can you tell him a little about what
he’d have to do Don

SMATHERS

He has to think about it If he says
yes I start the process to get him on
the ballot we crash course the local
issues and put him on a speaking tour
until he’s someone people care about
Wilmington West has a black republican
who we can unseat if we come up with
something unique And pardon the
bluntness but you’re that something

DARIUS
--It’s a lot to throw at someone

SMATHERS
It is And I don’t want an answer now
But you’ve got something special Darius
It’s the kinda thing that changes things

Off Darius--

EXT DOWNTOWN WILMINGTON PARK - DAY

minutes of

DARIUS
So you knew he was gonna say all that

RICK
He’d outlined the idea but I wanted you
to hear it direct

DARIUS
You don’t think it sounds a little
insane A guy with my background

RICK
(stopping to look at him)
I can think of a lot more insane stuff
that’s gone down in politics this year
alone So--no I think Don is right I
think you should just think about it

INT LIVING ROOM - RICK AND KATYA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Rick drinks a can of beer and watches a grainy tape on his
old school VCR The image on the screen is of Rick’s
grandfather JAMES DAYNE 70’s bow tie intact giving an
interview to a host on a 1970s Dick Cavatt-like show

JAMES DAYNE
Needless to say when Kennedy was
president and even going back to FDR
the press would turn a blind eye to their
“extracurricular” activities due to the
notion that there was a higher truth for
which they were working

KATYA (0S)
What is this

Rick turns to see Katya standing in the doorway

RICK
My grandfather on a talk show in 1977

KATYA
He looks cute

RICK
A month before he died

KATYA
I hope I have that much hair when I go

RICK
It’s like he’s predicting the death of
journalistic integrity

KATYA
Rick you’re a journalist who just freed
a wrongly-accused man

RICK
(re the TV)
I know but he’s talking about a higher
truth and today’s reality is that the
media no longer cares about that Our
job is to sell papers and the only truth
is that pussy sells more than policy

KATYA
Oh my god you’re like a redneck

RICK
I’m serious--

( )

KATYA
Canned beer VHS tapes “pussy” talk

OPAL

DARIUS

How many are there
OPAL

It’s none of your business
DARIUS

(a grin)

I know that ain’t true

OPAL
How

DARIUS
Because I have contacts I know things--

OPAL
Is that right

DARIUS
Youre damn right it’s right--

OPAL
So whattayou know

( )

DARIUS
I know you like to tell me youre dating
but that reality is you’re not ‘cause

you still like me

OPAL
And you know that

DARIUS
Yeah because I know you Opal Owens--

OPAL
No you don’t--

DARIUS
Yes I do--and I know that inside of you
there’s a special spot still on ice for
me Chilled and waiting

OPAL

got all kinds of shit on ice Darius but

INT LIVING ROOM - RICK AND KATYA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Rick and Katya eat pasta in their preferred “dining area”
the “paused” image of James Dayne remains frozen on the TV

KATYA
I’m having trouble eating with the image
of your grandfather staring at me

RICK
I thought you said he was cute

KATYA
He is but he’s making me question my
journalistic integrity Plus he looks
like he wants a bite of my linguine
Rick chews not answering

RICK
If you were Darius would you run

( )

KATYA
First off I’m so far from being Darius
it’s an absurd question second if I
were him I’d be too amused by the offer
to make up my mind

RICK
Why

KATYA
Because state democrats are so desperate
for someone who’s not half dead that
they’re willing to basically anoint a guy
who’s been in jail for 16 years I mean--

RICK
I would say he spent those years well--

KATYA
Yes but doesn’t it say something that
all it takes to excite people these days
is an articulate ex-con

RICK
I agree We want a higher truth

KATYA
No--you want that The rest of the world
wants a good sound bite

RICK
(pause a small grin)
I thought that’s what you liked about me

KATYA

Your desire for a higher truth
RICK

Yeah
KATYA

It is I just haven’t seen it in action
for awhile So I have to get used to it
again

They regard each other their own little form of foreplay

She looks but doesn’t answer they walk

OPAL

Same reason you like having me around
DARIUS

What is
OPAL

You wanna keep it real

DARIUS
Keep what real

OPAL
Your image in case you decide to do the
politics That way you have your true
black girl by your side

DARIUS
What--Why would I want--

OPAL
So that everybody thinks Darius McBain
didn’t turn into an Uncle Tom

DARIUS
That doesn’t make any sense--

OPAL
Of course it does--you think that if you
end up running for office it’s gonna be
more “authentic” to be living in the
projects and dating a black woman

DARIUS
According to who--

OPAL
According to what you think they think--

DARIUS
What I think they think is that it’s a
lot easier to vote for a black man who’s
with a white woman than for a black man
who’s with a black woman

( )

OPAL
Well I don’t think that’s true anymore
and I don’t think that’s what you think--

DARIUS
Well it is
(pause)
Besides we’re already married Opal so
I ain’t got no choice but to be with you

He tries to tickle her she sort of lets him Beat

OPAL

Well then maybe it’s something else
DARIUS

Maybe what is
OPAL

The reason you wanna be with me
DARIUS

Like what
OPAL

I dunno
DARIUS

Yeah you do you said that for a reason
(she’s not looking at him)
Opal Tell me what you’re talking about

OPAL
I’m just saying it could be another
reason why you want me by your side

DARIUS
Having to do with what

OPAL
With other stuff

DARIUS
Like what

OPAL
Like stuff you think I might know that
you don’t want me to talk about

DARIUS
Like what

( )

OPAL
Like stuff I don’t feel like talking
about right now Even though we’re
standing right here

She avoids his gaze looking at the empty street before them

DARIUS
-If you’re talking about what I think
you’re talking about then we should talk
about it

OPAL
We are

He looks where she’s looking silenceand then

DARIUS
The reason I want you back is because you
make me remember what my life was like
the last time I had a life You make me
start breathing again
(pause gentle)

OPAL
Yeah

Are you listening

Pause she looks at him

Darius sits on a couch Rick stands
DARIUS
So I’m leaning towards doing it I know

it’s a long shot but I can’t get the
idea out of my head

RICK
I think you’d do a great job
DARIUS
But I’d want you to run my campaign
(pause)

You’re the reason I’m free And I can’t
do it alone

Rick doesn’t react at firstand then a slow grin

RICK
I already have a job

DARIUS
Quit
(no reaction)
C’mon Rick it wouldn’t be the first
time a journalist switched sides

RICK
It’s nice of you to ask--

DARIUS
You don’t even like your job

RICK

(a smile)
I’ll give it some thought

( )

DARIUS
Will you
RICK
Yeah
Darius nodsthen stands
DARIUS

But there’s something we should talk
about A big thing And you’re about
the only person I can talk to about it

RICK
-All right

DARIUS
I was there the night Patrick Cragen got
shot

RICK

--What do you mean you were there

DARIUS
I was present

RICK
At the murder

DARIUS
Yeah I wasn’t a block away I was with
Ronny Standing next to him

RICK
Wait a minute--you were there

DARIUS
None of us had any idea it was gonna
happen It was a misunderstanding and
Ronny pulled his gun and shot the kid

RICK
-Wait so how did you get the gun

DARIUS
Ronny handed it to me and told me to
throw it in a dumpster

RICK
And when the cops picked you up--

( )

DARIUS
Same as I told you They had me pegged
for it the whole time and I didn’t have
the guts to give ‘em Ronny’s name

RICK
What about at the trial--

DARIUS
That’s when I said I was a block away

RICK
Why didn’t you just say the truth

DARIUS
Because the way they explained accomplice
liability to me was that if you’re there
partaking in a crime you’re still guilty

RICK
But was it a crime or just a fight
between Ronny and Cragen

DARIUS
I don’t know what the fuck it was Who
was ripping off who or if there was old
shit between them or if Ronny just lost
his cool And I haven’t talked to him
since that night so I still don’t know

RICK
desus Darius
DARIUS
I know--
RICK
I mean what the fuck
DARIUS
(pause)

If I had told you you wouldn’t have
written the articles

RICK
Well you’re fucking right

DARIUS
(quiet)
I didn’t shoot anybody I happened to be
standing next to a man when he shot
another man and when the police hit me
for the crime I didn’t rat out Ronny
(MORE )

( )

DARIUS (contd)
That’s all it all is 17 years old and
I’m trying to find my way through shit I
have no idea where it leads

Rick just looks at himthen turns away Beat

DARIUS (contd)
I put in 16 years for a murder I didn’t
commit I think I’m paid up

RICK
--So what am I supposed to say

DARIUS
I don’t know

RICK
And you’re still thinking about running

DARIUS
Yeah

RICK
That’s insane

DARIUS
Why

RICK
Because you were part of a murder

DARIUS
(honest )
I did the time Rick And the system did
its job I’m a better human being

Rick just looks at him a mix of incredulity shock and maybe
even awe at Darius’s ability to not only make this argument
but to make it sound good

DARIUS (contd)
So will you let me know what youre
thinking Because like I said I can’t
do it alone

RICK
(a smile at the audacity)

His manner is easy and fun as he acts out a story for them--

DARIUS

--and so this neo-Nazi-lookin’
motherfucker comes up to me in the prison
yard and says “I hear you’re the man to
talk to about self-education” And I go
“Well what is it you wanna learn” And
he says “I wanna get a sex-change”--I kid
you not and so I ask why and he’s goes
“Cause I hear the Parole Board likes it”

( )

Laughter as Darius suddenly sees Rick who’s been listening

DARIUS (contd)
Oh shit it’s Mr Rick Dayne

RICK
How’re you doing Darius

DARIUS
Getting to know my new neighbors You
all this is the man who helped get me
released

The guys greet Rick with the proper respect a friend of
their new friend handshakes nods

DARIUS (contd)

Manager tries to nod agreeably

INT RICKS BUICK - DAY

Rick drives Darius in the passenger seat After a moment

RICK

“Comportment”

RICK

DARIUS

As in “Don’t act too black”
RICK

That’s not what I said
DARIUS

No
RICK

(he drives)
It’s a matter of actingsenatorial
(no answer)
Especially when we’re trying to put
together ad footage

DARIUS
All I said was two bad words

RICK
It’s not just the language it’s the
overall presentation Believe me no
one’s asking you to act white it’s just
a matter of what people expect from their
politicians

( )

DARIUS
What they expect is white

RICK
No what they expect is composure

Darius smiles a little to himself looking out the window

RICK (contd)
--All that to say that CNN called today

It’s not a full story but they do wanna
do what they call a “45-second feature”

INT PRIVATE ROOM - NURSING HOME - DAY

They laugh as Darius gives her a kiss

You must be proud

JUDY
He was on Channel 3 last week and I made
everyone crowd in here to watch

DARIUS

DARIUS
“Fussed”--what are we in 1952

JUDY
I just wish your father could see

DARIUS
--Me too

RICK
(pause)
Is there any advice you have for Darius

Judy’s smile recedes as she regards her son intently

( )

JUDY

speak the truth People out there want
the truth and they want someone strong
enough to say it

(very soft straight to him)
So that’s what you should do my son
Just speak the truth

matter if I’m a plumber or a president
‘Cause I adore you Thats my job I

NEWS ANNOUNCER (0S)
Good evening and welcome to Channel 3
News at 11 In an exclusive report being
prepared for tomorrow Channel 3 has
learned that the IRS is investigating
quote “severe inconsistencies” in the
tax filings of democratic frontrunner for
US Senate Jon Lapham

Katya and Rick have stopped and are looking up to see file
footage of a 40-something white man at a book signing--

NEWS ANNOUNCER (0S) (contd)
Lapham who is expected to win next
month’s primary and challenge Republican
incumbent Gerry Phillips for his seat in
Washington declined to comment tonight

RICK
Where the hell did that come from

KATYA
He’s screwed

NEWS ANNOUNCER (0S)
Analyst Joe Rickshaw told Channel 3 that
if Lapham is forced to give up his senate
quest this late in the campaign
democrats would effectively be forced to
concede

TV SHOT on JOE RICKHAW professorial--

JOE RICKSHAW
The other contenders are a cosmetics
industry millionaire and a state
treasurer with a shady past The DNC’s
only hope to unseat Phillips would be to
hand-pick a radical alternative and pray

Katya is looking at Rick with a wry smile

( )

KATYA
Talk about getting your mojo

But Rick doesn’t answerhis mind too busy working overtime
INT PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - THE WILMINGTON HILTON - DAY

Rick Darius Don Smathers and four WHITE MEN IN SUITS sit on
big couches and chairs around a large coffee table full of
orange juice danish and meaty sides of bacon More than a
meeting this is a gathering of force FRED TOWERS 50’s
white congenial but fierce speaks to Darius

FRED TOWERS
Let me put it this way The Democratic
National Committee doesn’t fuck around
We wouldn’t be here if we didn’t think
you had a shot And I’m not just talking
about the primary

WHITE MAN IN SUIT
The primary is a shoe-in--

FRED TOWERS
Primary’s a no-brainer--

WHITE MAN IN SUIT
You’1l win the fucking primary--

FRED TOWERS
In-state polling suggests that with you
as the nominee we might cajole Phillips
into a false complacency and then
blindside the shit out of him

Darius looks at them amused

FRED TOWERS (contd)
This must sound strange
(no argument)
Gerry Phillips is beatable

DARIUS
No he’s not

FRED TOWERS
And thats the reason he is because
everyone thinks he’s not

DARIUS

I think you all just want more black
voters on the rolls

( )

The men laugh uncomfortably Fred turns to Smathers

FRED TOWERS

Is this what you meant by not to be
messed with

(Smathers smiles Fred zeroes

in on Darius)
You can think that if you want and maybe
it’s half-true but it doesn’t negate the
fact that politics in America is changing
faster than any of us here can keep up
with Guys like you are the future
Darius Smart no-bullshit embodying a
new American feel You are that and it
goes way beyond color

DARIUS
You think

FRED TOWERS
I do

DARIUS
As opposed to a good PR push for a seat
you’re gonna lose anyway
(Fred meets his stare)

A little DNC reverse minstrel show The
“eloquent” black man reciting party line
to a whole new block of voters--but maybe
without all that black vernacular

FRED TOWERS
Untrue my friend--

DARIUS
(a grin)
A telegenic nigger with a vocab

Fred regards him actually loving Darius’s nerve

FRED TOWERS
It’s provocative but false

DARIUS
OK So then I get to say what I want
the way I wanna say it

FRED TOWERS
(pause a grin)
We’ll send the occasional memo but you’re
not obliged to read it

( )

They watch each other carefully both with small smiles
Darius turns to Rick for his opinion

DARIUS
You’re my witness on that

RICK
I think what actually matters is that
they secure funding

FRED TOWERS

We have 5 million already slated plus
we‘ll put him on the soybean circuit

(to Darius)
Ever been to an agribusiness cocktail
party Biofuel-in-a-blanket shots of
ethanol

(to Rick)
This state’s got soybean coming out the
ass All he has to do is shake a couple
lobbyists’ hands and the cash flows

DARIUS
With what strings attached

FRED TOWERS
None Ford and GM just wanna be able to
say they’re pro-environment And you get
green in both senses of the word

The men await Rick’s opinion He finally turns to Darius
RICK

If you have the machine behind you then
I’d say forget about race forget about
political BS and just ask yourself
Do I have a message people need to hear
Because Fred’s right you can take the
primary fairly easily meaning you will
be heard The question is Do you have
something to say

All the white men look at Darius--

As MUSIC BEGINS--

Darius looks back at all the white men--

and it’s an across-the-board demographic

Darius backpedals downcourt blowing a kiss to the baby--
As the interviewer presses Rick

INTERVIEWER
But what about you Not so long ago you
were a respected journalist from a
prestigious newspaper family and yet
you’ve put all that on the line for the
sake of a long-shot candidate

RICK
First off Darius has a real shot of
beating Gerry Phillips and secondly you
should quit your job

--as Darius dribbles downcourt--

INTERVIEWER (0S)
Why is that

RICK (0S)
Because the aim of so-called journalism
these days is hit-and-run no-attention-
span schlock it’s insulting

HAND-HELD CLOSE-UP on Rick right into the camera

RICK (contd)
So when someone like McBain comes along
who unfailingly speaks truth to power and
provides answers we should all quit our
jobs and get on the goddam train

As Darius drives past two defenders and lays it in
INT DARIUS’S APARTMENT - LINCOLN HOUSES - NIGHT

Darius’s oasis in the projects It’s still the “towers” but
it is the top floor with views of downtown Wilmington
sparkling in the crisp night air and he’s furnished the

accoutrements including barbells framed prints and a flat

Pfiesteria Piscicida is a toxic
dinoflagellate--

RICK
Which is what

DARIUS
Fuck if I know--

The staff guys crack up--

( )

RICK
So we need to get on that--

DARIUS
The point is it’s associated with fish
lesions and deaths in coastal waters from
here down to North Carolina--

RICK
So why is it important

DARIUS
(honest)
It’s important because nobody starting
with me wants to be eating some halibut
and suddenly bite into a big brown puss-
emitting Pfiesteria lesion It’s an
issue that matters

Rick nods approvingly An aide turns to Rick--

The others

CAMPAIGN AIDE 1
He’s not gonna wear those sweats in

Mr McBain the question of your
inexperience has repeatedly come up can

persuading to love me back
(pause)
The thing is she’s convinced we’re gonna
lose

RICK
Why

DARIUS
Because we are I mean let’s be real--

RICK
Then why the hell are we here--

DARIUS
Fine well “win” but she thinks we
we’re gonna lose and I’m asking you not
to disillusion her of that

RICK

‘Cause it makes her uncomfortable She
doesn’t want all that so just help me
out and don’t talk about us “moving to
DC” or whatever

RICK
Fine

A KNOCK on the door

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - STATE JOURNAL OFFICES - DAY

Rick sits with his former colleagues Sean Matt Barnes and
other editorial and op-ed writers He’s on a soapbox--

RICK
You have a chance to endorse not only the
right man for this state but the kind of
candidate who’s gonna change the way we
do politics in this country

SEAN
But give examples of what he stands for

RICK
You want examples--Look at who’s
endorsed him in the last three days Pat
Buchanan Edgar Bronfman and Sean fucking
Penn A fascist a liberal Jew and a
movie star--three people who wouldn’t be
able to agree on a breakfast cereal

MATT BARNES
Meaning--

RICK
Meaning what he “stands for” is total
ideological independence

The staff is loving Rick’s newfound passion

SEAN
You’re jacked up Rick--

RICK
I’m totally jacked--

MATT BARNES
For the first time since Eugene McCarthy

RICK
You wanna know why Darius is 20 times
better than McCarthy

(MORE )

( )

RICK (contd)
It’s ‘cause he’s not nostalgic for
“liberalism” Every issue for him is
free of baggage or taboo which is what
voters thirst for Someone with an
untainted belief system

SEAN
(deadpan)
So you like the guy

RICK
I like the guy

SEAN
And what if he loses

RICK
I’‘1l come back here and write for sports

EXT CHICKEN PROCESSING PLANT - DAY

PHILLIPS the republican incumbent--white 60’s old-school
“sophistication”--is speaking to gathered reporters

GERRY PHILLIPS

This isn’t the first time Russia has
threatened to stop importing Delaware
poultry it happened in ‘96 and I’1l say
the same thing I said then We will not
be intimidated or threatened into making
concessions we don’t want to make

(waving off questions)
Granted they’re our country’s largest
foreign poultry market but pride is
pride especially poultry pride

(seeing Darius)
I see I’m not alone today

The media is loving this mini-confrontation and we watch
through their handheld cameras as Darius approaches

Mr McBain do you have any response to
the Russian threat

In a rare moment of what-the-fuck vulnerability Darius
glances at Rick He’s in way over his head and he knows it
He takes a momentthen eyeballs the CAMERAS

DARIUS
Sussex County is the top broiler-
producing county in the nation so I
don’t need to state that poultry around
here is powerful And as Ive just seen
Delaware producers do a darn good job

( )

ANGLE on the LATINO WORKERS listening intently--

DARIUS (contd)
But the fact is Russia is right to
demand that we reassess our techniques
Because we can do better

ANGLE on Rick suppressing a smile--

DARIUS (contd)

We can rotate shifts so workers avoid
muscle strain reduce workplace accidents
and compost more farm waste to make our
fertilizer organic

(flashing the charm)
Because personally I don’t want a little
Russian kid eating a chicken wing that I
wouldn’t delight in eating myself

Pause--and then the Latino workers break into LOUD APPLAUSE
DARIUS (contd)

Nice to meet you Gerry I was just

heading out but my debate offer stands

Hope to see you there
Darius smiles and heads for the parking lot as Rick watches
wondering if that was real He catches up to Darius and
they talk in hushed voices Darius sheds his cockiness

DARIUS (contd)
Was that too much

RICK
Maybe

DARIUS
Is he gonna debate me

RICK
He might have to after that

Darius stops and turns to Rick honest

DARIUS
I’m in a little over my head

INT TV STUDIO - DEBATE SET - NIGHT

Darius and Phillips sit on two stools triangulated by a
moderator’s table manned by JIM DINGLE 40’s white

GERRY PHILLIPS
As we all know racial profiling is a big
problem here particularly along the I-95
corridor and I’ve already drawn up
legislation that would strictly forbid
the practice by state troopers and local
police across the nation

ANGLE on the studio audience listening closely--
GERRY PHILLIPS (contd)
It is simply un-American to stop people

because of the way they look and I will
not stand for it

( )

JIM DINGLE
Mr McBain

DARIUS
If a trooper learns that black drug
dealers driving Lincolns are running
heroin from New York to DC on 95 and
my troopers spot a black man ina
Lincoln I say stop the man

GERRY PHILLIPS
That’s fascistic

DARIUS

There are Black men in this country who

deal drugs Gerry if you wanna stop the
drugs you need to stop some Black men

GERRY PHILLIPS
I’m beginning to understand Mr McBain’s
strategy here He’s gonna do all he can
to appeal to voters’ fears but were he
to win he’d vote far left down the line

DARIUS
My strategy is to find solutions that
actually solve even if it means crossing
the partisan line

FLASH on Rick nervously watching from the wings

JIM DINGLE
Mr McBain your limited foreign policy
experience is a concern to many voters
so Id like to ask how you would vote
when it comes to overseas intervention

DARIUS
Let’s be honest the world’s a messed up
place and we can’t be everywhere

FLASH on INMATES at Delaware State Prison watching on TV--

FLASH on a

DARIUS (contd)
--but when it comes to how we should act
I think Americans need to ask ourselves
What does it mean to be a part of the
human race Apart from all other
identity--what is it to be human

20-something audience member with a McBain button

( )

DARIUS (contd)
Now that may sound a little romantic but
if it feels inhumane to sit back and
watch people die in one country while
millions are spent chasing oil somewhere
else then shouldn’t that be a clue for
us to intervene

FLASH on DNC official Fred Towers listening gravely

JIM DINGLE
Senator Phillips

GERRY PHILLIPS
Self-interest has to be factored into our
decision-making Jim otherwise we’d have
troops in every country in the world

DARIUS
But even on a limited basis shouldn’t we
choose based on empathy Aren’t humanist
principles what this country is founded
on

GERRY PHILLIPS
I beg to disagree--

DARIUS
Well even if it’s not that’s how I would
vote I’11 vote how I’m human Because
for me politics does go that deep

Flash on Katya in the audience moved CAMERA finds Opal
next to her bored

JIM DINGLE
Senator Phillips you recently stated
that you were changing your stance on the
death penalty could you elaborate

GERRY PHILLIPS
(“courageous”)
I simply don’t feel we’ve come up with a
method for properly administering this
punishment Until we do we should
rehabilitate our criminals which our
prisons are fully capable of doing

JIM DINGLE
Mr McBain

( )

DARIUS
I’m for the death penalty Jim and I‘1l
tell you why Because for many the
alternative is life without parole which
in most prisons is a sentence worse than
death

GERRY PHILLIPS
This is a PR stunt

DARIUS
Life terms take away hope and a man
without hope might as well be dead

JIM DINGLE
But you yourself were wrongly accused--

DARIUS
Thats why we have to foolproof the
system but once we do let’s address the
roots of the problem

FLASH on Darius supporters confused--

DARIUS (contd)
Let the serial killers die and instead
fix the neighborhoods where most
criminals come from--

GERRY PHILLIPS
Youre switching the subject--

DARIUS
I’m talking about death--

GERRY PHILLIPS
And I’m discussing how we treat people

DARIUS
Fine then tell me if I hadn’t been
exonerated would you have lifted a pinkie
to treat me nicely Or would you have
watched me die so you could say you’re
tough on crime Gerry

Phillips eyes him carefully

GERRY PHILLIPS
Well let’s talk about that for a second

DARIUS
Fine

( )

JIM DINGLE
I’m not sure this is--

GERRY PHILLIPS

It’s OK--this is a discussion remember
not a debate As per the rules

(back to Darius)
You were accused of killing a man is
that correct

(Darius nods)
And then your conviction was overturned
due to a suddenly divulged confession

DARIUS
That’s right--

GERRY PHILLIPS
--in which Ronald Jackson stated that he
was the actual shooter

DARIUS
Correct

GERRY PHILLIPS
(point blank)
Where were you at the moment that Mr
Jackson shot his victim

JIM DINGLE
Is this relevant to today’s discussion

GERRY PHILLIPS
I would say it most definitely is

DARIUS
I was in the vicinity of the shooting
There’s no question that during this
period in my life I was in with the wrong
crowd So yes I was in the vicinity

GERRY PHILLIPS
Were you present at the shooting

ANGLE on the murmuring audience--

DARIUS
«eres I was

JIM DINGLE

Mr McBain just to clarify up to now
you’ve said that you were a block away

( )

ANGLE on Rick in the wings motioning the “cut” sign
Phillips and Dingle see this but Darius ignores

DARIUS
I’m not sure where you got this Senator
but it’s true that I witnessed Ronald
Jackson shoot Patrick Cragen

FLASH on Katya and Opal both now transfixed--

DARIUS (contd)
And because of accomplice liability laws
I lied and said I was a block away I
should’ve known better than to be there
and I paid 16 years for that mistake

GERRY PHILLIPS
Let’s not gloss over the facts You were
part of a drug deal gone bad in which
your partner shot a man in cold blood

FLASH on Rick watching tight-lipped--

GERRY PHILLIPS (contd)
You were standing next to him and
instead of calling the police you ran
then you confessed then retracted that
and fed them another lie and now that
the laws protect you--you ask for pity
because you didn’t know better

FLASH on frantic rumblings among the McBain supporters--

GERRY PHILLIPS (contd)
Well you know what--I don’t buy it You
watched as another human being was
brutally killed You watched and you
did nothing YOU DID NOTHING

(pause--grave)

And that’s not who the people of Delaware
want representing them

Silence--a stunned audience moderator DNC officials
DARIUS
(silence and then)

I don’t have a perfect past--

GERRY PHILLIPS
Here he goes again with the sob story--

DARIUS
But I’m better for what happened to me

( )

GERRY PHILLIPS
Why because you hung out in the prison
library

DARIUS
Because prison taught me things no book
could ever touch

GERRY PHILLIPS
Tell that to Patrick Cragen

JIM DINGLE
(beat)
Are you protected by double jeopardy
laws Mr McBain

DARIUS
I have no idea--

GERRY PHILLIPS
No but he’d be out for time served
which I’m sure he’s quite aware of
(to Darius direct)
You’re a liar sir You’re lying right
now You rely on a false past to play on
people’s sympathies

DARIUS
Why would people have sympathy--

GERRY PHILLIPS
Because you make them feel sorry for you

DARIUS
How

GERRY PHILLIPS
By acting as the poor wrongly accused
kid from the inner city But it’s a
lie And it’s immoral And it’s
illegal Which means that everything you
do should be followed by a question mark

Intense silence as we see shots of Opal Katya Rick
Darius’s tearful supporters and Phillips’ smirking aides

During the

DARIUS
(quiet humbled)
Youre right I did nothing I froze
and did nothing

following we see FLASHBACK SHOTS--beginning with

Darius doing push-ups in his prison cell

( )

DARIUS (0S) (contd)
Two years to the date of that murder I
woke up and made a vow to myself

Darius teaching a class to other inmates--

DARIUS (contd)
That I would spend the rest of my life
working to ensure that people who have
made mistakes like I did will not be
doomed to repeat them

Darius alone late-night studying in his cell--

DARIUS (contd)
I have kept that vow and I’1l add to it
right now that if elected--

Darius age 17 that night standing next to Patrick--

DARIUS (contd)
I will dedicate every ounce of my energy
toward making a world where the look I
saw in Patrick’s eyes that night--

cU on the young Darius intently watching Patrick--

DARIUS (contd)
--the look of horror and fear--no longer
exists Every ounce of my energy Gerry

RETURN to present the debate CU on Darius true

DARIUS (contd)
That’s where I’1l be coming from if
elected So until next week you can
call me what you want but that’s my
pledge---to Patrick’s family to the
people of Delaware to this nation

Phillips is looking at Darius unsure how to react Rick
allows himself the glimmer of a smile Katya is near
tearsbut Opal just looks downand shakes her head

Impressive really really impressive--

Thanks--

KATYA
No I’m serious--

Wouldn’t you say

OPAL
Among other things

Katya laughs but Darius doesn’t Rick enters pumped

INT UPSCALE BAR - COUNTER - NIGHT

KATYA
I mean it’s amazing Phillips blindsides

him and he doesn’t bat an eye
(MORE )

( )

Silence as

KATYA (contd)
Yes he was at the crime scene but it
doesn’t make him unqualified if
anything all senators should know what
it’s like on America’s streets

RICK
You’re right

KATYA
And then to defend himself like that on
TV in the moment it’s really you know--

RICK
It’s heavy--

KATYA
It’s totally fucking heavy

they sip

RICK
I should tell you by the way in terms
of what happened tonightit wasn’t
completely in the moment

KATYA
What wasn’t

RICK
The blindside

KATYA
--What do you mean

RICK
It just meanswe knew it was coming

KATYA
The blindside

RICK
Yeah I mean it was gonna come up
sooner or later from some reporter or
from Ronny reading about Darius so

KATYA
So what

RICK
So we leaked it to the Phillips’ staff

KATYA
»-You what

( )

RICK
We leaked it

KATYA

The fact that Darius was there
RICK

Yeah
KATYA

So his whole response was--

RICK
Scripted This shouldn’t piss you off

Katya stares at him speechless

RICK (contd)
It doesn’t make it less genuine it just
means we eliminated Phillips’ opportunity
to actually ambush us

KATYA
Excuse me but if you were still at the
paper and this happened you’d collect-
call heaven to cry to your grandfather

RICK
But I wouldn’t be surprised
(she just looks at him)
He didn’t lie about the facts all he did
was control their release It’s what
politicians do to ensure their message

KATYA
And what’s his message--that he’s pro-
death penalty

RICK
It’s what he believes

KATYA
Do you

RICK
I’m not sure--

KATYA
You fucking hate the death penalty

RICK
Well I’m not running for senator--

( )

KATYA
And I bet you he hates it too but he said
that so he could hijack the issue

RICK
And that would piss you off

KATYA
Yeah--

RICK
Because it didn’t seem to until just now

KATYA
Yeah when I discovered that he’s more of
a typical politician than I thought

RICK
It’s called political bullshit Katya
and it’s a necessary evil that wasn’t
exactly invented yesterday--

KATYA

I don’t mind the bullshit what’s
pathetic is you wanting to be in the club
so bad you’re willing to back opinions
you don’t even fucking hold

(she stands to go)

Even though you supposedly quit your job
out of “conviction”

RICK
Katya--

KATYA

It’s like you turned from Abbey Hoffman
to Karl Rove in 6 fucking months

night Patrick Cragen was shot

Does Darius know that

EXT RUNDOWN STREET - WILMINGTON - NIGHT

Rick and Opal at the same spot we earlier saw Opal and
Darius It’s not a pretty neighborhood

RICK
So who was here

OPAL

Ronny and Darius and the kid Over here
They got in an argument and started
pushing Ronny took his gun out or it
fell out and Darius picked it up and
shot the kid like this

She demonstrates an angle and shooting motion

RICK
Did he take it out or did it fall out

OPAL
I’m not sure

RICK
It’s important

OPAL
It fell out

RICK
And Darius picked it up

OPAL
And shot him

RICK
How come there was no powder residue on
Darius’s hands

OPAL
He musta’ been wearing gloves

( )

RICK
-And you saw all this from over there
(she nods)
And never told Darius

OPAL
I thought he’d tell me when he was ready
But he’s not gonna You saw him on TV
tonight everything he says is bullshit

RICK
Why

OPAL
Because it’s one thing to not tell the
truth it’s another to outright lie in
front of the whole fucking world

RICK

I’m having a little trouble here Opal
OPAL

You think I’m just trying to mess him up
RICK

No--
OPAL

You think he’s a “good man” ‘Cause he’s
not That’s what I’m saying Him
shooting that kid and lying about it is
the man Thats who he is

RICK
Why would Ronny take the blame 16
years later

OPAL
Maybe ‘cause he’s in for life anyway and
ain’t coming out Maybe he thinks he
owes D

RICK
Why would you stay with a guy if you knew
he was a murderer

OPAL
I didn’t stay with him

RICK
Why did you marry him

( )

OPAL
‘Cause I loved him

RICK
Even though you knew what you knew

OPAL
He was on death row

RICK
So then why didn’t you tell anybody once
he got out

OPAL
Because I thought maybe he already paid
his price That he was a new man and
that it might be OK
(pause)
But he’s not a new man And it’s not OK

Silence on the street Rick looks up the block

OPAL (contd)
You think I ain’t telling the truth

hello He arrives at his old cubicle unlocks a file cabinet
and starts to look through it After a moment Matt Barnes
pokes his head around

MATT BARNES
What’s up big guy

RICK
Hey Matt

( )

MATT BARNES
I thought you were gonna clear that shit
outta here

RICK
I will when I know I’m not coming back

MATT BARNES
I heard you weren’t coming back even if
he loses

RICK
---Ll’m not so sure

MATT BARNES
Why’s that

Rick doesn’t really want to have this conversation but the
question makes him stop with the files and look up

RICK
I guess there’s still a journalist in me
somewhere

MATT BARNES
I like to say that too but I usually
mean investigative and I’m usually
talking about my cock

Rick looks at him reluctantly finding this kinda funny

Rick goes

RICK
That’s good Matt

MATT BARNES
Thank you

back to the file cabinet

MATT BARNES (contd)
So what’re you looking for

RICK
(not looking up)
The name of a forensics guy from an old
case

INT TV DEN - LORENZO HOUSE - DAY

The dusty book-lined den of ABE LORENZO 81 white a
retired forensics expert who sits on a recliner feeble but

possessed

of a clear mind Rick sits on a small sofa as a

soap opera plays on a muted TV

( )

RICK
Darius’s lawyer was inept from Day One
but after the trial he did complain that
the prosecution kept misusing the word
“match” Is that--

ABE LORENZO
It’s absolutely true And I remember
because I’d made a point of repeatedly
saying under oath that the hairs on the
victim were “consistent” with McBain’s
but the DA kept saying they matched--
seven times he said this in his closing
argument alone McBain’s lawyer shoulda
called for a mistrial right there and
then

RICK
So just to be clear none of Darius’s
hair or skin fiber was ever found on the
victim’s coat

ABE LORENZO
None whatsoever

RICK
And we now know that the hairs that were
found belonged to Ronald Jackson

ABE LORENZO
DNA doesn’t lie

RICK
So you still believe Darius is innocent

ABE LORENZO
I do
(Rick absorbs content)
But who the hell am I--because all that
means is that Jackson was in close
proximity to the victim that night It
in no way proves that McBain wasn’t

INT BASKETBALL ARENA - UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE - DAY

Darius stands at an elevated podium at one end of the court
JFK-like charisma dripping off him He soaks up the frenzied
applause of an enormous crowd of mostly college kids who are

going nuts

for him a prolonged chant of DAR-I-US DAR-I-

US He tries to settle them down

( )

ANGLE on Rick anonymous at the far end of the arena high in
the stands taking it all in Darius finally calms the crowd
and continues his speech

DARIUS

Thank you thank you very much As I was
saying--

(the cheering again erupts--)
-as I was saying if we can allow
ourselves to re-imagine government then
we will literally be re-imagining our
world

Rick spots someone down on the court also watching Rick’s
POV on Katya standing alone to the side of the crowd
listening dubiously

Rick makes his way toward her as Darius continues

DARIUS (contd)
My spiritual and possibly biological
forefather Thomas Jefferson--

The crowd goes nuts and a smiling Darius waits for them to
settle

DARIUS (contd)
Thomas Jefferson struggled to keep the
federal government out of his little red
hair--

Rick makes his way through the crowd toward Katya--

DARIUS (contd)
--and I think we can learn from that
For there are times when government can
help but there are also times when it
hurts

Rick taps Katya on the shoulder She turns and upon seeing
him gives the slightest of smiles Darius’s speech now
fades into the BG as we pick up their conversation

RICK
Hey

at the surrounding crowd

She looks at him not finding this funny

You’re not gonna find a lotta moral
complexity here

KATYA
No but it’s a good gauge as to how full
of shit someone is College kids tend to
have excellent bullshit radar

RICK
Not when they’re blinded by ideals

KATYA
Speak for yourself Joan Baez

around me”

Meaning I’d like you to tell me

RONNY
I pulled the trigger

I fucking confessed to the thing man
you think I’d make that shit up

RICK
Why did it take so long to confess

RONNY
You ever confessed to murder

RICK

Listen I realize that you essentially
got 12 free years because Darius didn’t
say your name So I’d understand if you
had an urge to somehow return that favor
I get that--

RONNY
You get that

RICK
Ll understand it But right now
because Darius has become a public
figure I need you to throw that notion
aside This isn’t about one-on-one
loyalty it’s about someone trying to be
a representative of the people meaning
the people have to know exactly who it is
that’s seeking to do that on their
behalf

RONNY
Why

RICK
Because it’s their right

Ronny just sort of smiles this argument isn’t exactly
bringing tears to his eyes Beatand then

( )

Off Rick--

INT RICK’

RONNY
I shot Patrick Cragen Just like I shot
the other person I’m in here for I
ain’t proud of it I wish I hadn’t but I
did

RICK
And what about Darius

RONNY

Darius was there standing next to me
but that’s all he did He wasn’t the
kinda kid to do that He was too smart

(pause honest)
I swear to God on forty bibles and my
mother’s grave he didn’t do it He’s
not that guy

S BUICK - NIGHT

Rick drives through beautiful southern Delaware farmland

listening

to a radio ad

RADIO VOICE (0S)
As an innocent bystander Darius McBain
spent 16 years studying our justice
system firsthand Though wrongly-
convicted he patiently waited out an
appeals process was a model prisoner a
prolific writer and a diligent leader in
his community Darius McBain doesn’t
politicize the issues he knows them
Gerry Phillips says McBain would be soft
of crime But what in the world does

Phillips know

Rick keeps driving expressionless

RADIO VOICE (0S) (contd)
Vote this Tuesday for Darius McBain for
US Senate
(Rick’s mouth tightens a
little)
This ad paid for and approved by the Fund
To Elect Darius McBain

Rick is forced to crack an ironic smile As it fades
idea comes to himand he quickly looks at his watch

an
INT DINING ROOM - MCDONALD NURSING HOME - DAY
Rick sits at a corner table with Darius’s mom Judy McBain

JUDY
Where is he today

RICK
Speaking to a labor union
(pause)
He doesn’t know I’m here

JUDY
--Uh oh

RICK
Why do you say that

JUDY
Doesn’t that usually mean trouble

RICK
It’s not trouble I justI’m sort of at
a loss

JUDY

About what

RICK
About whether your son tells the truth

Silence as a slow small smile comes to her lips

JUDY
You don’t think Darius tells the truth

RICK
I’m not sure that it’s a hundred per cent
down the line

JUDY

Is this about something in particular
RICK

Yes
JUDY

(pause)

I don’t really know Darius that well

anymore 16 years is a long time
RICK

Of course

( )

JUDY
But I can tell you that growing up he
had a way of getting at truth that was
particular to him

RICK
How so

JUDY
He wasn’t against cutting a corner if he
thought that what he was getting to was
more important

RICK
Meaning a little lie is OK

JUDY
So long as you’re doing it to accomplish
a big truth

RICK
Do you think he’s still like that

JUDY
I have no idea Mr Dayne
(pause)
But I do love my son And I have faith
in his heart

EXT COURTYARD - LINCOLN HOUSES - NIGHT

Rick conspicuous with his white skin and corduroy blazer
approaches the entrance to the project tower where Darius
lives A couple young men loitering out front give him the
once-over

INT CORRIDOR - LINCOLN HOUES - NIGHT

Rick exits the elevator and heads toward Darius’s door As
he does we see DAMON a bodyguard black 30s posted out

front

RICK
Hey Damon

DAMON
Hey Rick He know you’re coming

RICK
No

Damon KNOCKS on Darius’s door as Rick gathers himself After
a moment Darius opens the door He gives Rick a look

( )

DARIUS
Well well Didn’t know if I was gonna
see you again

RICK
I’ve been running around a lot
(Darius just nods)
Can I come in

INT DARIUS’S APARTMENT - LINCOLN HOUSES - NIGHT

Rick stands at the window looking out Darius holds two cans
of beer offering one to Rick

RICK
No thanks

Darius puts the other beer back in the fridge He opens his
own Silence

DARIUS
So you gonna tell me where you been all
day

RICK
How’s Opal Darius

DARIUS
-She’s all right

RICK
Yeah

DARIUS
No Actually
(pause)
She said she wants to take a break

RICK
She say why

DARIUS
WellI told her about Fred Towers
wanting us not to announce the wedding
ceremony until after the election

RICK
You told her that

DARIUS
I wanted to be up front

( )

RICK
Did you say that it’s because the DNC
doesn’t want people reminded that their
next senator’s married to quote a
welfare queen

DARIUS
I didn’t use those exact words But she
got the point

RICK
I see

DARIUS
Look she’s gotta understand that there’s
always gonna political games going on
but that if we stick it out it’1ll be
worth it ‘cause we’re in it for the
right reasons

Rick just nods again looking out the window

DARIUS (contd)
You should tell me what’s going on Rick

RICK
--I need to ask you more about what
happened the night Patrick Cragen died

DARIUS
- Why

RICK
Because I was told something that I don’t
think I believe but I wanna make sure
(pause)
It’s about who pulled the trigger

DARIUS
Weve already been through this--

RICK
I wanna go through it again

DARIUS
Ronny pulled the trigger I was standing
next to him it took all three of us by
surprise

RICK
Were there any witnesses

( )

DARIUS
No Not that I know of

RICK
(beat--direct)
Opal told me she saw you shoot Patrick
that night That she was walking down
the block looking for you and that she
saw you pick up Ronny’s gun and shoot
Cragen as the two of them were fighting

Beat Darius slowly takes a sip of his beer

RICK (contd)

I also spoke to Ronny earlier who swore
to me that he was the one who shot him
So here’s my dilemma I don’t know what
to believe I want very badly to believe
you so bad I can’t even tell you but I
also don’t think that the people of
Delaware should elect as their senator a
murderer And as a journalist or former
journalist or whatever I am I know this
information needs to come out

(pause)
Otherwise you’re gonna win on Tuesday and
I’m not gonna know who you are

DARIUS
(beat)
Is it you who needs to know or is it the
voters

RICK

Depends on the answer If you didn’t do
it it’s just me and we discredit the
shit out of Opal if she tries to go
public but if you’re guilty it’s the
voters

(Darius remains silent)
You’re one percentage point back Darius
I need you to talk to me I need you to
tell me something

DARIUS
I didn’t shoot Patrick Cragen

RICK
That’s it

DARIUS
That’s it

( )

RICK
Can you tell me why Opal’s saying you
did
DARIUS

‘Cause she thinks I’m bullshit That I’m
embracing a system she despises and so
she wants to pull me down

RICK
Why

DARIUS
To keep her company in hating the world
instead of doing something to fix it
It’s fear

RICK
Of what

DARIUS

Of black people succeeding When one of
us does well it freaks the others out
Were not used to it

(Rick just waits for more)
She’s lying Rick If it was true she
would’ve confronted me directly but
instead she comes to you She sees our
numbers coming up she’s scared of how
her life might change so she tells a lie
to tear it all down

RICK

You gotta give me more--
DARIUS

Why --
RICK

Because you’re not convincing me--

DARIUS
(intense)
I don’t have to--Don’t be a fucking
hypocrite Vote for me or don’t but
don’t read into something that’s got
nothing to do with what I’m saying

RICK
How can I trust what you’re saying if I
can’t even know what you did

(MORE )

( )

RICK (contd)
Because I’m sorry but there is a huge
difference between you being next to him
and you pulling the trigger

DARIUS
Is there In the long run

RICK
OK--you and I need to rethink things--

DARIUS
Tell me the difference--

RICK
Because next to him means you’re a kid in
the wrong place at the wrong time and
pulling the trigger means you sorely lack
judgment in making decisions that affect
the lives of others--

DARIUS
What matters is forward thinking not
back--

RICK

No Darius it matters--if you shot him--
it matters

Silence a stand-off neither giving in After a
moment Darius speaks quietly but firmly

DARIUS

I speak what I believe every single time
I talk I look and I describe how I
think the world might get better Period

(pause)
So whatever you’re going through right
now be it your self-image or your
grandfather’s image or whatever I can’t
help Because whatever it is you wanna
“know” about me isn’t knowable

(pause quiet)
I mean even if I did do it Rick

(he watches Rick closely

giving nothing away)
--which I didn’t but even if I had it
still wouldn’t make you know me Because
that kind of knowing doesn’t exist You
don’t get to know what a person thinks
about when they go to bed at night all
you get to know is how they act when they
wake up

(finally stepping away)

(MORE )

long

( )

DARIUS (contd)
So you wanna trust me--Then trust what
you see Not what you hear from a sad
embittered woman

Off Rick---not convinced
INT MCBAIN CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - DAY

The office is in full swing 25-30 staff and volunteers
getting the vote out via phone and internet JAMES BROWN
plays from a boom-box lending a hyped-up quality to the last
minute activity A TV plays CNN in the corner

CNN ANNOUNCER
With less than 72 hours left the senate
race in Delaware could still offer a big
upset as come-from-behind candidate
Darius McBain continues to cut the lead
of incumbent Gerry Phillips

CAMERA FINDS Rick in a corner quietly wrapping up a call

RICK
Thank you sir Yes I’11 talk to him
and call you backThank You sir

Rick hangs up thinks for a moment then looks up and speaks
to an AIDE

RICK (contd)
Is he still asleep

AIDE 1
He said wake him at 3

RICK
(off his watch)
I‘1l be a little early
INT SIDE OFFICE - MCBAIN HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Darius sprawled on a couch Rick half-knocks and lets
himself in

RICK
Hey Darius
DARIUS
(eyes heavy)
Yeah

RICK
I need to talk

( )

Darius looks at his watch doesn’t say anything but slowly
sits up Rick waits for himand then

RICK (contd)

I want you to talk to Patrick Cragen’s
father

(pause as Darius absorbs)
I’ve been thinking about this non-stop
and I don’t know what the fuck else to
do soso that’s my idea Talk to him
and tell him something he can believe in

(pause)
And I don’t know if that means belief
about what happened or if it means
asking forgiveness or if it’s just
something about how he should get through
his day each day I don’t know But I
want you to tell him something truthful
And only you knows what that means

Darius more awake now looks at Rick

DARIUS
And you think that’s gonna achieve
something

RICK
Yeah Because if you make a believer out
of him then maybe it’s good enough for
me
(beat)
I told him you have something to say but
if you don’t wanna

DARIUS
And if I don’t wanna then what

RICK
-l haven’t decided

Darius gives a resigned chuckle at Rick’s dilemma Then

DARIUS
I‘1l do it

EXT HUNTINGTON PARK - SUBURBAN WILMINGTON - DUSK

Rick and Darius stand shivering a bit in this mostly-deserted
park on a late-autumn Sunday at dusk The occasional jogger
passes or a mother pushing a stroller home from the
playground but for the most part it’s empty and the waning
light prevents people from recognizing Darius Neither man
talksuntil Rick sees someone in the distance

( )

RICK
Here he comes

Darius turns to see Jim Cragen slowly walking toward them
They go to meet him

RICK (contd)
Hi Mr Cragen Thanks for meeting us

He nods his hello he looks at Darius

DARIUS
Hello Sir

JIM GRAGEN
Hi

Beat

RICK
So I’m gonna let you two talk I’11 wait
here

Darius somewhat awkwardly gestures and he and Cragen begin
walking along a path Rick watches them After a moment he
glances at his watch then takes out his cell phone and speed
dials

RICK (contd)
Hey it’s me

CUT TO Katya on her cell in the PRODUCTION ROOM of the TV
studio where they tape her show CROSS-CUT as needed

KATYA
I didn’t know we were still talking

RICK
We are we’re just not sleeping together

KATYA
I see

RICK
Maybe when this is over I’1l come back
off the couch so to speak

KATYA
May-be

RICK
In the meantime When are you taping
tonight

( )

KATYA
(off her watch)
In two hours

As they speak Rick keeps a steady eye on Cragen and Darius

KATYA (contd)
Why you have something for me

RICK
I’m not sure

KATYA
Well you better hurry up

RICK
Something tells me you’1l take what you
get Seeing as there’s not much else
that’1l put a dent in Darius

KATYA
--I can still try to tarnish the image

RICK
No doubt

Rick watches as Darius and Jim now stop walking and face each
other standing close talking

KATYA
Of course if this is just an attempt by
you and Machiavelli to plant more
information for your own benefit then
I’m not interested

RICK
No this would be all me

KATYA
Where is he now

RICK
He’s here

KATYA
And where is here

RICK
At a park

KATYA

Doing what

( )

RICK
Trying to figure out what’s right

KATYA
I don’t have time for this Rick Call
me back if you’re serious but do it
quick

She clicks off Rick folds his phone still watching Darius
and Jim After a long moment they turn and start to walk
solemnly back toward him darkness now descending rapidly
Rick goes to meet themknowing it’s decision time

As they come closer we glimpse Cragen’s face close enough
to see that he may (or may not) have been crying He speaks
quietly to Rick

JIM GRAGEN
Thank you

RICK
Sure

Rick studies Cragen’s face for a sign of what’s happened He
looks to Darius as well but both men are attempting to cover
any emotions

RICK (contd)
Is everything OK sir

JIM GRAGEN
Yes
(a small nod)
I should go

Cragen turns to Darius Quiet

JIM GRAGEN (contd)
I’m glad we spoke

DARIUS
So am lI

JIM GRAGEN
(very quiet)
--OK then
Beat Then slowly Jim gives Darius a hug it is simple
still and quiet Rick watches awed but not sure what by
After a long moment they come apart Jim turns shakes
Rick’s hand nods and leaveswithout saying another word

Darius and Rick stand in silence watching him go Finally

( )

RICK
How did that go

DARIUS
--It was good

RICK
(pause)
You still feel OK about going forward
with this

DARIUS
Do you

RICK
(pauseand then )
Yeah
(pause)
Do you

DARIUS
Yeah

RICK
--OK then

They regard each other once moreand then Darius walks
toward the car Rick lets him go watchingthen takes out
his cell phone opens it and speed dials

RICK (contd)

Hey it’s me So I was wrong I don’t
have anything

(he listens)
Yeah wellOK then

(pause)
I’m sorry

(he listens)
Goodbye

He shuts off knowing he’s just ended a relationship Beat
After a moment he looks up and watches as Darius makes his
solitary way toward the car at the edge of the park After
another moment two ladies taking a “power walk” recognize
Darius and go to him Rick watches as Darius takes out a pen
and signs their sweat-suits They are blushing enthralled
by their encounter

Rick pockets his phone smiles a little to himselfand
starts to walk over

THE END
