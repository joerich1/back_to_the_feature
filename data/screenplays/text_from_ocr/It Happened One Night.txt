FADE IN

Part One The HARBOR at Miami Beach FADES IN providing
quick VIEWS of yachts aquaplanes and luxurious ship-craft
lying at anchor in the calm tranquil waters of tropical
Florida This dissolves to the NAME PLATE on the side of a
yacht reading ELSPETH II and this in turn to a YACHT
CORRIDOR where a steward is standing in front of a cabin
door near a small collapsible table upon which there is a
tray of steaming food He lifts lids and examines the
contents A heavy-set sailor stands guard near the cabin
door

STEWARD
Fine Fine She ought to like this
(to the guard)
Open the door

GUARD
(without moving)
Whos gonna take it in to her
You

STEWARD
Oh no
(turning)
Mullison Come on

The VIEW WIDENS to include MULLISON a waiter His eye is
decorated with a shiner

MULLISON
Not me sir She threw a ketchup
bottle at me this morning

STEWARD
Well orders are orders Somebodys
gotta take it in
(he turns to someone
else)
Fredericks

The VIEW MOVES to another waiter who has a patch of bandage
on his face

FREDERICKS
Before I bring her another meal
Ill be put off the ship first

STEWARDS VOICE
Henri

The VIEW MOVES over to a Frenchman

HENRI
(vehemently)
No Monsieur When I leave the
Ritz you do not say I have to wait
on crazy womans

The VIEW MOVES BACK to include the Steward and the others
grouped around him

ANOTHER WAITER (A COCKNEY)
My wife was an angel compared to
this one sir And I walked out on
her

GUARD
(impatiently)
Come on Make up your mind

A petty officer approaches He is blustering and officious
but the type that is feeble and ineffective His name is
Lacey

LACEY
(talking
quicklydstaccato)
Whats up Whats up

There is a fairly close picture of the GROUP featuring
Lacey and the Steward

STEWARD
These pigs Theyre afraid to take
her food in

LACEY

Thats ridiculous Afraid of a
mere girl

(he wheels on the
steward)

Why didnt you do it yourself

STEWARD
(more afraid than
the
othersostammering)
Whydléwell I never thought aboutd6

LACEY
(shoving him aside)
I never heard of such a thing
Afraid of a mere girl
(moving to the tray)
Ill take it in myself

They all stand around and watch him much relieved He
picks up the tray and starts toward the door of the cabin

LACEY

(as he

walksémuttering)
Cant get a thing done unless you
do it yourself

(as he approaches

the door)
Open the door

We SEE him at the CABIN DOOR as the guard quickly and
gingerly unlocks it

LACEY
Afraid of a mere girl Ridiculous

Lacey stalks in bravely the tray held majestically in
front of him while the steward and waiters form a circle
around the door waiting expectantly There is a short
pause following which Lacey comes hurling out backwards
and lands on his back the tray of food scattering all

over him The steward quickly bangs the door shut and turns
the key as the waiters stare silently

The scene DISSOLVES TO the MAIN DECK of the yacht first
affording a CLOSE VIEW of a pair of well-shod masculine
feet as they pace agitatedly back and forth Then as the
scene draws back the possessor of the pacing feet is
discovered to be Alexander Andrews immaculately groomed
in yachting clothes In front of him stands a uniformed
Captain but Andrews brows wrinkled deep in thought
continues his pacing

ANDREWS
(murmuring to himself)
On a hunger strike huh
(a grunt)
Whend she eat last

CAPTAIN
She hasnt had a thing yesterdaydor
today

ANDREWS

Been sending her meals in regularly

CAPTAIN
Yessir She refuses them all

ANDREWS
(snappily)
Why didnt you jam it down her
throat

CAPTAIN
Its not quite that simple
(he shakes his head)
Ive dealt with prisoners in my
time but this oned

ANDREWS
Absurd
(muttering)
All this fuss over a snip of a
girl
(suddenly)
Im going down to see her myself
He leaves with determination followed by the Captain and
both are then seen walking in the direction of the cabin
Andrews grim

CAPTAIN
This is dangerous business Mr
Andrews After all kidnapping is
no childs play

But Andrews ignores him and merely stares grimly forward
They arrive in front of the cabin door where Lacey is
brushing himself off and where a couple of waiters are
picking up the last pieces of the broken dishes

ANDREWS
Whats this Whats happened here

LACEY
(pathetically)
She refused another meal sir

ANDREWS
Get another tray ready Bring it
here at once
(to the guard)
Open the door

The Guard unlocks the door and Andrews enters Then WE GET
A VIEW of the CABIN at the door as Andrews enters and
closes the door behind him He looks around and his eyes
light on his prisoner following which the VIEW SWINGS
OVER to ELLIE a beautiful girl in her early twenties At
the moment she holds a small vase over her head ready to
heave it and her eyes flash angrily At sight of her new
visitor however she lowers the vase and sets it ona
small table

ELLIE
What do you want

Andrews doesnt stir from the door

ANDREWS
Whats this about not eating

ELLIE
(sitting)
I dont want to eat
(raising her voice)
And theres one more thing I dont
want Definitely Thats to see
you

She lights a cigarette Andrews watches her a moment

ANDREWS
Know what my next move is No more
cigarettes

ELLIE
Why dont you put me in chains

ANDREWS
I might
ELLIE
(now seen at close
range)

All right Put me in chains Do
anything you want But Im not
going to eat a thing until you let
me off this boat

She stares petulantly out at the blue sky but Andrews
comes over and sits beside her

ANDREWS
(tenderly)
Come on Ellie Stop being silly
You know Im going to have my way

ELLIE
(moving away)
I wont stand for it I wont stand
for your running my life Why do
you insist on it

ANDREWS
(still tender)
You ought to know why Becauseé

ELLIE

(interrupting)
Yes I know

(shes heard it a

million times)
Because Im your daughter and you
love me Because you dont want me
to make any mistakes Becaused

ANDREWS
(joining in)
Because marrying that fool King
Westley isd

ELLIE
(snappily)
Youre wasting your time Im
already married to him

ANDREWS
(sharply)
Not so far as Im concerned youre
not
(they are interrupted
by a knock at the
door)

Yes

The door opens and several waiters parade in with trays of
steaming food

ELLIE
(starting for them
threateningly)
How many times have I told you not
to bring any food in here

The waiters back up frightened but Andrews saves them

ANDREWS
Wait a minute Dont get excited
This isnt for you
(to the waiters)
Put it right here

Ellie glares at her father and wanders over to the window
seat while the waiters occupy themselves setting the table
Andrews putters around the food lifting the lids from
which tempting aromas emanate He shuts his eyes murmuring
oohs and ahs

A CLOSE-UP of ELLIE shows her too drinking in the inviting
aromas and for a moment she weakens A CLOSE VIEW of
ANDREWS shows him glancing toward Ellie to see her reaction
whereupon Ellies face (again appearing in a CLOSE-UP)
freezes Then Andrews and the waiters come into VIEW

FIRST WAITER
Anything else Monsieur

ANDREWS

No Everything seems quite
satisfactory I may want some more
of that delicious gravy Ill ring

WAITER
Very good Monsieur

The waiters bow their way out as Andrews pecks at the food

ANDREWS
(making clucking
noise)
Heavenly

Now Ellie appears in the foreground with Andrews at the
table in the background

ELLIE
(disdainfully)
Smart arent you So subtle

ANDREWS
(chewing on a
mouthful of food)
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul it
would change the whole political
situation in India

ELLIE

You cant tempt me
(shouting
unnecessarily)

Do you hear I wont eat

ANDREWS
(quietly)
Please I cant fight on an empty
stomach Remember what Napoleon
said

ELLIE
I hope youre not comparing yourself
to Napoleon He was a strategist
Your idea of strategy is to use a
lead pipe

Andrews eats silently while Ellie rants at him walking
around and puffing vigorously on her cigarette

ELLIE
(muttering)
Most humiliating thing ever happened
to me
(shuddering)

A bunch of gorillas shoving me in
a car That crowd outside the
justice of the peacedmust have
thought I was a criminaldéor
something

A CLOSE VIEW of ANDREWS intercuts with part of Ellies
speech At the end of her speech he smacks his lips
enjoying the food with too great a relish Then the two
are seen together

ELLIE
(after a
pausedéstrongly)
Where are you taking me

ANDREWS
(carelessly)
South America

ELLIE
(aghast)
South America

ANDREWS
We leave Miami in an hour Soons
we get some supplies aboard

ELLIE
(threateningly)
Youll have a corpse on your hands
That what Youll have I wont eat
a thing while Im on this boat

ANDREWS
(buttering bread)
In that event we wont need so
many supplies

ELLIE
(exasperated)
What do you expect to accomplish
by all this Im already married

ANDREWS
Ill get it annulled

ELLIE
Youll never do it You cant do
it

ANDREWS

(now seen CLOSE as

he speaks between

snatches of food)
Ill do it if it takes every penny
Ive got Ill do it if I have to
bribe that musical comedy Justice
of the Peace Ill do itéif I have
to prove that you were dragged in
staggering drunk You probably
were

(he smacks his lips)
Mmmommm This filet mignon is
divine

ELLIE
(seen with her father)
Whatve you got against King
Westley

ANDREWS
Nothing much I just think hes a
fake thats all

ELLIE
You only met him once

ANDREWS
That was enough Do you mind handing
me the ketchup

ELLIE
You talk as if he were a gigolodor
something

ANDREWS
(risingdreaching
for ketchup)
Never minddoIll get it myself
(he falls back in
his chair)
Gigolo Why you took the word
right out of my mouth Thanks

ELLIE
(seen closer now
with Andrews)
Hes one of the best fliers in the
country Right now hes planning a
trip to Japan

ANDREWS
Youre going to finance him I
suppose

ELLIE

Why not Look what hes doing for
aviation It takes courage to do
what he does And character At
least hes accomplished something
worthwhile I suppose youd like

to have me marry a business man
Well I hate business
mendoparticularly if youre a shining
example

He grins not at all offended knowing she doesnt mean
it

ELLIE
Your whole life is devoted to just
one thing To accumulate more money
At least theres romance in what
hes doing

ANDREWS
(unequivocally)
Hes no good Ellie and you know
it You married him only because I
told you not to

ELLIE
(strongly)
Youve been telling me what not to
do since I was old enough to
remember
(screaming)
Im sick of it

And as Andrews ignores her she starts moving around the
table toward himé6Next she appears sitting on the edge of
Andrews chair and she throws her arm around his shoulder

ELLIE

(pleading sweetly)
Aw listen Dad Lets not fight
like this any more I know youre
worried about medand want me to be
happy And I love you for it But
please try to understand Youre
not being fair darling This isnt
just a crazy impulse of mine King
and I talked about it a lot before
we decided to get married Lookéwhy
cant we give it a trialdlets
sayofor a year or so If its wrong
King and I will be the first to
know it We can get a divorce
cant we Now be a dear and let
me off the boat Keeping me prisoner
like this is so silly

Andrews has been listening silently throughout the speech
giving no indication of his feelings in the matter

ANDREWS
(unimpressed)
Youll be set free when the marriage
is annulled

A CLOSE-UP of ELLIE her eyes blazing angrily shows her
slowly edging away from her father while he continues

ANDREWS VOICE
(carelessly)
So theres no use being a stubborn
idiot

ELLIE
(hissing)
I come from a long line of stubborn
idiots

ANDREWS
(again seen with
her calmly)
A time will come when youll thank
me for this

ELLIE
(wildly)
I wont thank you Ill never thank
you

ANDREWS
Please dont shout

ELLIE
Ill shout to my hearts content
Ill scream if I want to

ANDREWS
(reaching for it)
Ah Coconut layer cake Nice and
gooey too Just the way I like
it

He is about to insert the first bite in his mouth w
Ellie her temper vanishing completely overturns t
serving table dumping its contents into her father
The movement is so unexpected that Andrews the for
suspended near his mouth stares at her stupefied T

realizing what she has done his eyes flash in anger

Dropping his fork he rises and goes over to her w
she stands facing him defiantly Without a word or w
he slaps her a stinging blow across the cheek For a
she doesnt stir her eyes widening in surprise and
at him unbelievingly Then turning abruptly she bolt
of the door Andrews remains motionless his eyes s
painfully it is the first time he has struck her a
hurts

ANDREWS

(calling)
Ellie

(and he starts for

the door)
Next on the DECK at the open cabin
door Andrews is seen staring off
at something and an amazed
frightened look comes into his
eyes Then as VIEWed from his
position at the cabin door Ellie
appears standing on the rail and
with a professional dive she leaps
into the water

A FULL VIEW of the DECK reveals the crew and the off
scurrying around several of them shouting Somebod
overboard

ANDREWS
Its my daughter Go after her

CAPTAIN
(shouting)

Lower the boats

General excitement reigns several of the crew dive

into
the water others release the boat lines Following this
Ellie is seen swimming furiously against the giant waves
Next she appears as a small speck in the distance while
half a dozen of the crew are swimming in pursuit

At the SIDE OF THE YACHT one of the boats has already been
lowered and two men jump in and grab the oars The men
seem to be gaining on Ellie In the distance several small
motor boats are anchored and over the sides of the boats
their owners are fishing Ellie seems to be headed in their
direction

One of the motor boats appears closer A middle-aged man
sits on the stern holding lazily to his line his feet
dangling in the water as the boat is tossed around by the
turbulent waves ELLIE is then again seen swimming She
looks back and the next scene shows the men rowing toward
her and gaining on her Thereupon we see Ellie ducking
under the water

The middle-aged fisherman is suddenly startled by Ellies
face which appears from under water right between his
legs Ellie puts her finger up to her lips warning him to
shush and he is too dumb-founded to say anything As the
pursuing boats come near Ellie ducks under the water again
and the boats scoot right by the fisherman Then Ellies
head bobs up she peers ahead of her and seeing that her
pursuers have passed her she smiles victoriously

ELLIE
(to the fisherman)
Thanks
(and she starts
swimming toward
shore)

The scene DISSOLVES TO the DECK of the YACHT as Ellies
pursuers clamber aboard Andrews waiting for them

A MAN
Sorry sir She got away

ANDREWS
(disappointed but
proud)
Of course she got awaydtoo smart
for you
CAPTAIN

What a hell cat No controlling

(murmuring)

ANDREWS
(resentfully)
Terrible Nothing terrible about

(smiling)

Shes not going to get it though

She wont get very far Has no

money

CAPTAIN
What about that diamond wrist watch

on that

ANDREWS

(his face falling)
Holy Smoke I forgot all about

his side)

OFFICER
Yessir

The VIEW DRAWS IN to afford a CLOSE-UP of ANDREWS staring
out at the sea his face wreathed in a broad smile then
this fades out

PART TWO

The RAILROAD STATION of an active terminal in Miami FADES
IN The VIEW MOVES DOWN to the ENTRANCE GATE TO THE TRAINS
passengers hurrying through it then picks out two men
obviously detectives who have their eyes peeled on everyone
passing through Then the VIEW affords a GLIMPSE of ELLIE
who stands watching the detectives This scene WIPING OFF
we see an AIR TRANSPORT with several planes tuning up in
the background As passengers file through several
detectives stand around in a watchful pose This scene
WIPING OFF the front of a WESTERN UNION OFFICE comes into
VIEW Several people walk in and out At the side of the
door two detectives are on the lookout

This scene also WIPES OFF revealing the WAITING ROOM of a
BUS STATION Over the ticket window there is a sign reading
BUY BUS TICKETS HERE and a line forms in front of it
Here too there are two detectives

FIRST DETECTIVE
Were wastin our time Can you
picture Ellie Andrews ridin ona
bus

SECOND DETECTIVE
I told the old man it was the bunk

The VIEW MOVES from them to ELLIE who stands behind a
post and is watching the two detectives apprehensively As
the two (VIEWed from her position) stand by the ticket
window one of them turns toward her Thereupon we see
her slipping behind a post concealing herself Just then
a little old lady approaches her

OLD LADY
Heres your ticket maam

ELLIE
Oh thank you Thank you very much
(she takes the ticket
and change from
the old lady and
hands her a bill)
Here

OLD LADY
Oh thank you Thank you

ELLIE
When does the bus leave

OLD LADY
In about fifteen minutes

ELLIE
Thank you

She picks up a small overnight bag from the floor and
hurries away She crosses to the entrance of the waiting
room and disappears through the doors The VIEW then wings
over to a TELEPHONE BOOTH near the entrance Clustered
around the booth are half a dozen men of varied appearance
The inside of the booth is lighted and a young man Peter
Warne waves his hands wildly as he shouts into the phone
although it is impossible to hear what he is saying A
close inspection of the men surrounding the booth (the
scene contracting to a CLOSE VIEW) reveals them as being
slightly and happily intoxicated A short man approaches
the door of the booth

SHORTY
Hey whats going on here Id
like to use that phone

FIRST MAN
(a reporter)
Shh Quiet This is history in the
making
SHORTY

FIRST MAN

rest)

PETERS VOICE

GROUP

PETER
(shouting into the
phone)
Listen monkey-facedwhen you fired

GORDON

Say listen you wouldnt know a
story if it reached up and kicked
you in the pants

(listening)
Yeah Sure sure I got your copy

going to write it in Greek Id

PETER
(again seen close
at the phone)
That was free verse you gashouse
palooka

GORDON
(at the phone in
the newspaper office)
Free verse huh

A CLOSE VIEW of PETER WARNE in the telephone booth gives
evidence of his having also imbibed freely

And the scene CUTS TO a New York NEWSPAPER OFFICE where
the night editor Gordon his sleeves rolled up
his desk shrieking into the phone

sits at
(shouting)
What the dickens was free about
it It cost this paper a gob of
dough Well Im here to tell you
its not gonna cost us any more

PETER

(in his phone booth)
Thats okay by me Cause as far
as Im concerned Im through with
newspapers See Im through with
stupidity Ill never write another
newspaper story for you or anybody
else if I have to starve

(after a pause)
Yeah What about my novel When I
get through with thatd

GORDON
(in his office)
When you get through with that
Ill have a beard down to my ankles
(at this point
Gordons secretary

enters)
SECRETARY

GORDON
(looking up)

SECRETARY

GORDON

(into the phone)
Say listen you When you get
back to New York take my advice
and stay f-a-r away from this
officeédunless you dont care what
happens to that funny map of yours

(he bangs down the

receiver viciously

and glowers at the

phone)

In the PHONE BOOTH Peter reacts to the phone being hung up
on him But he goes right on for the benefit of the boys

PETER
(into the dead phone)
Oh so youre changing your tune
eh Well its about time But
its going to do you no good my
tough friend Its a little too
late for apologies I wouldnt go
back to work for you if you begged
me on your hands and knees I hope
this is a lesson to you

He snaps up the receiver with a great pretense of outraged
pride following which the VIEW EXPANDS to INCLUDE his
PUBLIC

MEN
Atta-boy Peter Thats telling
him Peter

The gang is full of admiration for the courageous way he
talked to the boss as Peter staggers out of the booth

PETER
Give me any of his lip will he
Huh I guess he knows now what I
think of his job
(expansively)
Is my chariot ready

FIRST MAN
Your chariot awaiteth withouteth
oh mighty King

MEN
Make way for the King Long live
the King Make way

With head held high he struts majestically out of sight
followed by his admirers following which the scene
DISSOLVES TO the BUS STATION His inebriated admirers stand
around the entrance to a bus while Peter stands on the
steps his suitcase in his hand

PETER

(making a grand

speech)
Thats right my friends Cling to
your jobs Remain slaves the rest
of your lives Scum of the earth
Newspaper men Not me When Im
basking in the glorious arms of
the Musedéwhatll you be doing
Chasing news You miserable worms

goes out to you

(with arms extended

and in tremolo

voice)
Good-bye

(and with this he

turns his back and
enters the bus)

MEN
(in the same spirit)
Goodbye Oh mighty King Peace be
with you Courageous One

ANNOUNCERS VOICE
All aboard Philadelphia New York

All aboard
GROUP
Look out Get back Farewell
Farewell
PETER
Scram

The scene CUTS TO the INTERIOR of the BUS as VIEWed from

the front the VIEW moving forward passing the conglomerate
of unprepossessing human beings who occupy the seats Every
space is taken and the occupants seem hot and uncomfortable
which adds to their uninviting appearance Mothers cling

to crying babies A Swedish farm hand and his young wife

are already busy opening their basket of food prepared for
the long journey A surly-looking hoodlum traveling alone

is slumped in his seat his cap drawn carelessly over his
eyes The moving VIEW passes these and other characters
until it reaches one unoccupied seat in the car unoccupied
except for several bundles of newspapers

Standing before the seat is Peter his suitcase in his
hand speculating as to what disposition to make of the
newspapers

PETER
(calling)
Hey driver How about clearing
this stuff away

Several passengers (SEEN FROM HIS POSITION IN THE BACK)
crane their necks to scrutinize the intruder Through a
glass partition the driver can be seen receiving his last
minute instructions from a superintendent who stands on
the running board their voices indistinguishable In answer
to Peters request the driver glances back indifferently
and continues talking to the superintendent A CLOSE VIEW
of PETER shows him arching his eyebrows an amused
acknowledgment of the disdainful attitude of the driver
He drops his suitcase and starts forward Then we see him
arriving at the glass partition and Peter taps playfully
on the pane with his finger-nails whereupon the driver
turns and pulls the window down a few inches

DRIVER
(annoyed)
Whadda you want
PETER
(pleasantly)
If youll be good enough to remove
those newspapers Ill have a seat

DRIVER
(irritably)
Okay Okay Keep your shirt on
young feller
(with which remark
the driver turns
away from him)

PETER
(looking at the
back of the drivers
neck for a moment
then confidentially)
Just between you and me I never
intended taking it off

He wheels around uncertainly and swaggers jauntily down

the aisle toward the empty seat En route he bestows genial
smiles upon several of his disgruntled fellow passengers
and he stops in front of a robust lady who at the moment

is breast-feeding her baby while a lighted cigarette dangles
from her lips

PETER

Personally I was raised on a
bottle

(as the woman looks

up at him perplexed)
When I was a baby I insisted on
it You know why

(as the woman stares

up stupidly)
I never liked the idea of getting
cigarette ashes in my eyes

He moves forward leaving the woman unable to make head or
tail of it and assuming that hes crazy she shrugs her
shoulders and turns her attention to the baby

Now PETER arrives at his seat and whistling softly raises
the window Unhurriedly he picks the newspaper bundles up
one by one and flings them out of the window They hit the
sidewalk below with a dull thud Thereupon a CLOSE VIEW of
the DRIVER shows him reacting violently to Peters
unprecedented cheek and starting down from his seat

PETER has now cleared the seat of all the newspaper bundles
and still whistling his favorite melody he picks up his
suitcase preparatory to placing it in the rack overhead

At this point the driver enters the side door of the bus
DRIVER
(pugnaciously)
Hey wait a minute

Peter his arms holding the suitcase over his head turns
and glances at the driver a quizzical look in his eyes

DRIVER
(coming forward)
What do you think youre doing

PETER
(turning)
Huh
DRIVER
(bellowing)
The papers The papers Whadda you
mean throwin em out
PETER

Ohothe papersd

He slowly lowers his arms and deposits the suitcase on the
floor

PETER
(now seen close
with the Driver)
Thats a long story my friend
You see I dont like sitting on

newspapers I did once and all the
headlines came off on my white
pants

DRIVER
Hey whadda you tryin to dodkid
me

PETER
Oh I wouldnt kid you On the

level it actually happened Nobody
bought a paper that day They

followed me all over town and read
the news from the seat of my pants

DRIVER
Whatre you gonna do about the
papers Somebodys gotta pick em
up

PETER
(turning to his
suitcase)
Its okay with me Im not arguing

DRIVER
(pugnaciously)
Fresh guy huh What you need is a
good sock on the nose

PETER

(turning back to

him)
Look here partner You may not
like my nose But I do Its a
good nose The only one Ive got
I always keep it out in the open
where anybody can take a sock at
it If you decide to do it make
sure you dont miss

During his speech Ellie enters from the rear and plunks
herself into Peters seat Unseen by Peter she places her
small bag beside her

DRIVER
(answering Peter
weakly)
Oh yeah

PETER

Now thats a brilliant answer
Why didnt I think of it Our
conversation could have been over

ong ago
DRIVER
Oh yeah
PETER
(exhausted)
You win

Smiling he turns to sit down But the smile dies on his
face when he finds his place occupied by Ellie who stares
out the window

PETER
(now at close range
with Ellie)
Excuse me ladyd
(slowly) 6)
but that upon which you sitdis

mine
Ellie glances up at himdédthen down at her buttocks
ELLIE
(eyes flashing)

I beg your pardon

PETER
Now listen Im in a very ugly
mood I put up a stiff battle for
that seat So if its just the
same to youd

(gesturing with

thumb)
scram

ELLIE
(ignoring himdcalling)
Driver

The driver who has stopped to witness this new altercation
returns

ELLIE
Are those seats reserved

DRIVER
(pleased to
discomfort Peter)
No First come first served

ELLIE
(dismissing the
whole thing)
Thank you
(Peter thwarted
for a moment just
glares at her)

PETER
(also calling)
Driver
DRIVER
Yeah
PETER

These seats accommodate two
passengers dont they

DRIVER
(hating to give in)
Maybe they dodand maybe they dont

Peter lifts Ellies overnight bag off the seat and drops
it on the floor Part of her coat covers the small space
by her side This he sweeps across her lap

PETER
Move over lady This is a maybe
they do

He plops into the seat the other passengers around them
heaving a sigh of relief Ellie flashes him a devastating
look and deliberately turns her back on him But Peter
suddenly looks down toward the floor following which a
CLOSE-UP AT THEIR FEET reveals that Ellies bag on the
floor annoys Peter With his foot he slowly moves it over
to her and Ellies foot is seen pushing it back whereupon
Peter viciously kicks it over to her side again Next we
see Ellie glaring at him picking up her bag and standing
on the seat depositing it on the rack overhead But just
then the bus starts forward with a lurch which unbalances
her and she falls backward right in Peters lap Their
noses almost touch Their eyes meet and they glare at
each other hostilely Ellie quickly scrambles off and gets
back in her seat turning her back on him

PETER
(amused)
Next time you drop in bring your
folks

This DISSOLVES TO a COUNTRY ROAD and the bus sways
perilously as it speeds through the night following which
the VIEW DISSOLVES TO the INTERIOR of the BUS revealing
Peter slumped in his seat his hat drawn over his eyes
Ellie has her head thrown back trying to sleep But the
swaying bus causes her head to roll from side to side
uncomfortably and finally she gives up

ELLIE
(an order)
Tell that man not to drive so fast
(at which Peter
just cocks his
head slightly)

PETER
Are you talking to me

ELLIE
Yes Tell that man to drive slowly

Peter stares at her a moment resenting her officious
manner

PETER
(pleasantly)
Okay

And much to her surprise he sighs deeply and relaxes to
his former position shutting his eyes She glares at him
crushingly

The scene DISSOLVES TO another VIEW of the BUS disclosing
the driver and suddenly the bus comes to a stop

DRIVER
(sticking his head
in to face the
passengers)
Rest station Ten minutes
The VIEW DRAWS BACK as some of the passengers rise The

men stretch their legs and the women straighten out their
skirts A CLOSE VIEW of Peter and Ellie then shows her
rising Peter accommodatingly shoves his feet aside for

her to pass and Ellie starts up the aisle But she suddenly
stops looks back first at her bag and then at Peter
decides to take her bag with her and returns to take it
She reaches for it on the rack Peter watching her amused

The scene DISSOLVES TO the outside of the REST STATION
with several passengers walking briskly back and forth

The place is dimly lit by one or two lamp-posts and Peter
can be seen leaning against one of these posts smoking a
cigarette The scene moving in a CLOSE VIEW of Peter shows
him stealing a glance in the direction of Ellie Anda
VIEW from his angle reveals Ellie in the shadow of the
bus her bag at her feet She slowly turns her head toward
Peter and then quickly averts it

PETER (SEEN CLOSE) speculates about her He glances around
e place and the scene moves about following his gaze
t takes in the other passengers all obviously poor and
ncultured The MOVING VIEW reaches Ellie The contrast is
erceptible Thereupon we see Peter reacting with
omprehension No doubt about it She doesnt belong with
ese passengers Then suddenly he sees something which
tartles him and we SEE what it is Directly in back of
er the young hoodlum passenger slyly lifts her overnight
ag from the ground and starts running with it Ellie is
blivious of his actions PETER springs forward

O7T7HUt AT EHE

Ellie sees Peter coming toward her and is perceptibly
startled But Peter whizzes by her and this amazes her
even more She shrugs her shoulders perplexed and resumes
her smoking In a few seconds Peter returns puffing
breathlessly

PETER
He got away I suddenly found myself
in the middle of the brush and not
a sign of the skunk

ELLIE (seen CLOSE with PETER) doesnt know what hes talking
about She looks at him puzzled

ELLIE
I dont know what youre raving
about young man And furthermore
Im not interested

PETER
(taken aback)
Welldéof all thedwellé
(hard)
Maybe youll be interested to know
your bags gone
At this Ellie wheels around and stares at the spot where
her bag had been

ELLIE
Oh my heavens Its gone

PETER
(sarcastically)
Yeah I knew youd catch on
eventually
ELLIE

What happened

PETER
That cadaverous-looking yegg who
sat in front of us just up and
took it Boy how that baby can
run

ELLIE
What am I going to do now

PETER
Dont tell me your ticket was in
it

ELLIE

(opening her purse)
No Ive got that all right But
my money All I have here is four
dollars Ive got to get to New
York with it

PETER
You can wire home for some money
when we get to Jacksonville

ELLIE
Why noolé
(catching herself
Yes I guess I will

PETER
(starting out)
Ill report it to the driver About
your bag I mean

ELLIE
(quickly)
No Id rather you didnt

PETER
Dont be a fool You lost your
bag The companyll make good
Whats your name
ELLIE
I dont want it reported

PETER
Why thats ridiculous Theyre
responsible for everything thato

ELLIE

(hotly)
See here can you understand
English I dont want it reported

(she starts away)
Please stay out of my affairs I
want to be left alone

(with which she

disappears from

the scene)
A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him
glaring after her

PETER
(mumbling)
Why you ungrateful brat

The scene DISSOLVES TO the BUS where all the passengers

are scattering back to their seats Peter is already seated
when Ellie arrives A CLOSE VIEW then shows her standing
uncertainly for a moment speculating whether to cross

over his legs to get her place by the window Peter feels
her presence by his side and glances up She tosses her

head and plants herself in the seat in front of him vacated
by the young man who stole her bag Peter takes the affront
with a shrug and slides over gratefully to the coveted

spot near the window

The scene DISSOLVES TO a CLOSE VIEW of Ellie and a recently
arrived fat man next to her She has her head thrown back
in an effort to sleep but the fat man his hands clasped
over his protruding stomach snores disgustingly and the
rumble of the flying bus accompanies him Suddenly the bus
careens the fat man falls against Ellie and she awakens
with a start and pushes him back The fat mans snoring
goes on uninterrupted and Ellie relaxes again but ina
few seconds the procedure is repeated and Ellie is beside
herself She looks around for somewhere to flee

PETER seated in back of her in his customary slumped
position opens his eyes slightly It is apparent he has
been watching her for some time for he grins at her
discomfiture Ellies head turns in his direction and the
grin leaves Peters face He shuts his eyes and pretends
to be asleep Ellie glances at Peter to make certain he is
asleep The fat man falls against her again and it is all
she can stand She starts to rise Peter sees her coming
and deliberately puts his hand on the seat next to him
still pretending to be asleep Just as Ellie starts to
sit she notices his hand and is embarrassed Gingerly she
picks up his limp hand and places it on his knee She then
slides into the seat sighing with relief whereupon Peter
opens his eyes and is amused Slowly his head turnsdand he
scrutinizes her soberly and appraisingly Ellie slowly
turns her head for a glimpse of Peterdand is startled to
find him gazing at her She turns forward her jaw set
forbiddingly

The scene DISSOLVES TO the VIEW of a ROAD It is dawn and
in the distance against the horizon the bus a mere speck
makes its lone way over the deserted country This dissolves
to a large SIGN reading JACKSONVILLE and then into the
BUS affording a CLOSE VIEW of ELLIE and PETER They are

both asleep her head resting comfortably on his shoulder
Peters topcoat thrown over her Then the VIEW draws back
The bus is empty except for Ellie and Peter the last few
passengers are just leaving

PETERs eyes slowly open He looks down at the head on his
shoulder and grins With a sigh he shuts his eyes again
and resumes his slumber Next at the front of the bus
the DRIVER stands staring at Peter and Ellie in this
intimate position and his mouth twists knowingly

DRIVER
(murmuring)
Oh yeah

ELLIE stirs squirms a little uncomfortably and with a
sleepy grunt shifts her position Just as she settles down
her eyes open She stares out of the window with unseeing
eyes and then closes them

Dreamily giving the impression that still half conscious
she is trying to recall where she is Apparently she does
for her eyes suddenly snap open and she lifts her head
Finally (in a scene including Peter) Ellie realizes that
she has been sleeping on his shoulder whereupon she
straightens up embarrassed

ELLIE
Oh Im sorryd

(FEEBLY SMILING)
Silly isnt it

She looks around and her finding herself alone with Peter
adds to her embarrassment

ELLIE
Everybodys gone

She lifts her arms to adjust her hat and becomes conscious
of his coat over her which slips She stares at it
thoughtfully for a momentdthen at Peter
ELLIE
(realizing that he
put it there)
Oh thank you
(she hands him his
coat ill at ease)
Were in Jacksonville arent we

PETER
Yes

ELLIE
(nervously)
That was foolish of me Why didnt
you shove me away

PETER
I hated to wake you up
(she glances at him
speculatively)
How about some breakfast

ELLIE
No thank you
(she rises anxious
to get away)
Thank you so much

Most uncomfortably she edges away from him toward the
front of the bus Peter watching her leave his interest
definitely provoked

The scene CUTS TO the STAND as Ellie emerges from the bus
At the foot of the steps is the driver

ELLIE
How much time have I

DRIVER
About a half hour

ELLIE
Im going over to the Windsor Hotel

Peter appears in the door of the bus in the background
and a CLOSE VIEW then shows him stopping to listen as he
sees Ellie talking to the Driver

DRIVERS VOICE
The Windsor Youll never make it
in time

ELLIES VOICE
Youll have to wait for me

DRIVERS VOICE
(aghast)
Wait for you

A smile flits across Peters face then a wider VIEW shows
Ellie leaving the driver

ELLIE
(as she goes)
Yes I may be a few minutes late

She disappears from sight leaving the driver staring at
her dumbly and Peter standing in back of the driver
shakes his head in amazement

e scene DISSOLVES TO the BUS STAND later that morningdat
e same spot where the bus had previously been It is no
onger there however A huge crowd fills the space and
e VIEW moving down through the crowd singles Ellie out
e has just arrived and looks around helplessly Finally
e spots a uniformed terminal guard and approaches him

DHDoNOtrHEAH

ELLIE
(now next to the
Guard)
Wheres the bus to New York

GUARD
Left twenty minutes ago

ELLIE
Why thats ridiculous I was on
that busdéI told them to wait

GUARD

Sorry Miss Its gone

(and he turns his

back on her)
Ellies face clouds The crowds
surge about her She looks around
thoughtfully Suddenly her eyes
open in surprise at something she
sees and the VIEW then moves over
to Peter who sits on his suitcase
looking toward Ellie

PETER
Good morning

Peter is in the foreground the GUARD is SEEN in the
background Ellie stares at Peter perplexed

PETER
Remember me Im the fellow you
slept on last night

ELLIE
Seems to me Ive already thanked
you for that
(turning to guard)
What time is the next bus to New
York

GUARD
(turning)
Eight oclock tonight

ELLIE
Eight oclock Why thats twelve
hours

GUARD

Sorry Miss

The Guard leaves the scene and Ellies disappointment is
apparent

PETER
(sarcastically)
Whats the matter Wouldnt the
old meanies wait for you
(Ellie glares at
him disdaining to
replydothis angers
him and he
continues hotly)
Say how old are you anyway Dont
you know these busses work on a
schedule You need a guardian

ELLIE
(starting away)
What are you excited about You
missed the bus too

Peter looks at her a moment before replying

PETER
(quietly)
Yeah I missed it too

There is a CLOSE VIEW of the two She turns to him Her
interest is provoked by his tone of voice She glances up
into his face

ELLIE
Dont tell me you did it on my
account
(pause)

hope youre not getting any idea
that what happened last night isé
(she interrupts
herself)
You neednt concern yourself about
me young man I can take care of
myself
PETER
Youre doing a pretty sloppy job
of it
(he reaches in his
pocket)
Heres your ticket

ELLIE
(surprised)
My ticket
PETER

I found it on the seat

ELLIE
(taking it)
Oh thank you Must have fallen
out of my pocket

While she is putting the ticket away in her purse Peter
speaks

PETER
Youll never get away with it
Miss Andrews
(this is a shock to
Ellie)

ELLIE
(weakly)
What are you talking about

PETER
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man
You and Westleyll make an ideal
team

ELLIE
(bluffing it through)
Will you please tell me what youre
raving about

PETER
Youll never get away with it
Miss Andrews Your fatherll stop
you before you get half way to New
York

ELLIE
You must have me confused withé

PETER
(interrupting)
Quit kidding Its all over the
front pages You know Ive always
been curious about the kind of a
girl that would marry King Westley

He pulls a newspaper out of his pocket and hands it to
her Ellie glances at the headline hurriedly

PETER
(while she reads)
Take my advicedgrab the first bus
back to Miami That guys a phony

ELLIE
(looking up at him)
I didnt ask for your advice
(she hands the paper
back)

PETER
Thats right You didnt

ELLIE
Youre not going to notify my
father are you

PETER
(looking at her
squarely)
What for

ELLIE
If you play your cards right you
might get some money out of it
(a disdainful
expression crosses
his face)

PETER
I never thought of that

ELLIE

(frantically)
Listen if youll promise not to
do it Ill pay you Ill pay you
as much as he will You wont gain
anything by giving me away as long
as Im willing to make it worth
your while Ive got to get to New
York without being stopped Its
terribly important to me Id pay

when I jumped off the yacht was my
wrist watch and I had to pawn that
to get these clothes Ill give
you my address and you can get in
touch with me the minute you get
to New York

PETER
(furious)
Never mind You know I had

you

pegged right from the start youre

the spoiled brat of a rich

father

The only way you can get anything

is to buy it Now youre in a jam
and all you can think of is your
money It never fails does it

minute Let me tell you something

maybe itd take a load off

your

mind You dont have to worry about
me Im not interested in your
money or your problems You King
Westley your father youre alla

lot of hooey to me

He turns his back on her and leaves

A CLOSE-UP of ELLIE

shows her staring after him her eyes blazing angrily

In a TELEGRAPH OFFICE Peter addresses a girl operator as
he drops a telegram on the counter which she reads

PETER
(brusquely)
You send telegrams here

OPERATOR
(recognizing him
apparently
sarcastically)

Im just fine thanks and how are

PETER
(firmly)

As the clerk takes the wire from him scene FADES OUT

Part Three The BUS TERMINAL FADES IN It is night now and
the rain comes down in torrents People scurry around to
get into the buses as the voice of an announcer is heard

ANNOUNCERS VOICE
Bus for blah-blah-blah-
blahéCharlestondéblah-blah-blahdéand
all points North to New York

This DISSOLVES TO the interior of a BUS which is
practically filled Peter is in his seat reading a
magazine while Ellie enters hurriedly from the rear door
and starts forward As she approaches Peter she hesitates
a second and deliberately passes him plunking herself
into a seat in the opposite aisle Peter turns just as she
gets seated He glances at her indifferently

A CLOSE VIEW shows Ellie seated next to a man who sits
reading a newspaper which covers his face Her eyes are
fixed forward her lips set adamantly A CLOSE-UP of the
MAN next to Ellie makes it plain that he is a typical
drummer At the moment he is absorbed in a serial story
but suddenly he becomes aware of something at his feet
and without lowering the newspaper his gaze slowly shifts
downward At this the VIEW moves down until it reaches
Ellies trim ankles Her feet beat a regular tattoo on the
floor her extreme agitation is evident The VIEW MOVES
BACK SLOWLY taking in Ellies shapely leg as far as the
knee Then we see ELLIE and the DRUMMER as his gaze is
still fixed on her leg Slowly his face breaks into a
lascivious grin he lowers his paper and turns for a
scrutiny of her face What he sees apparently delights
him for he drops his paper completelydéand smiles broadly

DRUMMER
Hi sisterOAll alone My names
Shapeley
(Ellie favors him

with a devastating

look which is wasted

on the drummer)
Might as well get acquainted Its
gonna be a long tripdogets tiresome
later on Specially for somebody
like you You look like you got
class

(he surveys her

from head to foot)
Yessir With a capital K

(he chuckles at his

own sally)
And Im a guy that knows class
when he sees it believe you me

A CLOSE-UP of ELLIE as Shapeleys voice continues shows
her glancing back at Peter expecting him to come to her
rescue

SHAPELEYS VOICE
Ask any of the boys Theyll tell
you Shapeley sure knows how to
pick em Yessir Shapeleys the
name and thats the way I like
em

Ellie again looks toward Peter But PETER seems to have
found something of unusual interest in his magazine
and we again SEE the harassed ELLIE and the irrepressible
SHAPELEY who continues

SHAPELEY
You made no mistake sitting next
to me
(confidentially)

Just between us the kinda muggs
you meet on a hop like this aint
nothing to write home to the wife
about You gotta be awful careful
who you hit up with is what I
always say and you cant be too
particular neither Once when I
was comin through North Carolina
I got to gabbin with a good-lookin
mama One of those young ones you
know and plenty classy too Kinda
struck my fancy You know how it
is Well sir you coulda knocked
me over with a Mack truck I was
just warming up when shes yanked
offa the bus Who do you think she
was Huh Might as well give up
The girl bandit The one the papers
been writin about

(he pulls out a

cigar and

continuesdawed by

the recollection)
Yessir you coulda knocked me over
with a Mack truck

(he lights his cigar

takes a vigorous

puff and turns to

her again)
Whats the matter sister You
aint sayin much

ELLIE

(intending to freeze

him)
Seems to me youre doing excellently
without any assistance

(this however only

brings a guffaw

from the drummer)

SHAPELEY
Thats pretty good Well
shut my big nasty mouth

A CLOSE-UP shows ELLIE enduring more of this as Shapeleys
voice continues

SHAPELEYS VOICE
Looks like youre one up on
me Nothin I like better than to
meet a high-class mama that can
snap em back at you Cause the
colder they are the hotter they
get is what I always say

Now Ellie and Shapeley are seen together with Peter seen
in the BACKGROUND

SHAPELEY
Take this last town I was in I
run into a damedénot a bad looker
eitherdbut boy was she an iceberg
Every time I opened my kisser she
pulls a ten strike on me It sure
looked like cold turkey for old
man Shapeley I sell office
supplies see And this hotsy-
totsy lays the damper on me quick
She dont need a thingdand if she
did she wouldnt buy it froma
fresh mugg like me Well says I
to myselfdShapeley you better go
to work Youre up against a lulu
Well Im here to tell you sister
I opened up a line of fast chatter
that had that dame spinnin like a
Russian dancer Before I got through
she bought enough stuff to last

the firm a year And did she put

on an act when I blew town

Ellie has scarcely listened to him

and has divided her

attention between glancing back at Peter and staring at
Shapeley as if he were insanednone of which bothers

Shapeley He goes on with his merry

chatter blowing rings

of smoke in the direction of the ceiling

SHAPELEY

Yessir When a cold mama gets

hotdoboy how she sizzles

She

kinda cramped my style though I

didnt look at a dame for
towns
(quickly)

three

Not that I couldnt For me its
always a cinch I got a much better
chance than the local talent

(confidentially)

You see theyre kinda leery about
the local talent Too close to

home Know what I mean

ELLIE has now reached the point where she could without

any compunction strangle him

SHAPELEYS VOICE

(continuing over
this glimpse of
her desperation)

But take a bird like medits here
todayoand gone tomorrow And what
happens is nobodys business

At this time she turns helplessly toward Peter but we see
PETER being deliberately oblivious of her presence

following which the three are seen
BACKGROUND

SHAPELEY

with Peter in the

But I dont go in for that kinda
stuffomuch I like to pick my
fillies Take you for instance

Youre my type No kiddin

sister

I could go for you in a big way
Fun-on-the-side Shapeley they
call me and the accent is on the

fun believe you me
(this is all Ellie
can stand)

ELLIE
(snappily)

Believe you me you bore me to
distraction

(But Shapeley merely throws his head back and emits his
characteristic guffaw)

SHAPELEY
(laughing)
Well youre two up on me now
(he holds up two
fingers)

PETER
(approaching them)
Hey you

Shapeleys laugh dies down He looks dumbly up at Peter
his two fingers still held in mid-air

SHAPELEY
Huh

PETER
(indicating his own
seat)
Theres a seat over there for you

SHAPELEY
Whats the idea

PETER
Id like to sit with myduhdéwifedif
you dont mind
(at which Shapeleys
face falls)

SHAPELEY
(puzzled)
Wife

PETER
Yeah Come ondcome on

SHAPELEY
(rising)
Oh excuse me
(edging away)
I was just tryindyou knowdto make
things pleasant

And smiling sheepishly he sidles over to Peters seat

his two fingers still poised in air Peter plants himself
next to Ellie and totally ignoring her opens his magazine
and resumes his reading Then Ellie and Peter are SEEN
CLOSE together She looks up at him

ELLIE
If you promise not to snap my head
off Id like to thank you

PETER
(without turning)

Forget it I didnt do it for you
His voice got on my nerves

She feels herself crushed and ventures no further comment
as Peter resumes his interest in his magazine

A FULL VIEW of the BUS follows and there is silence for a
while as the bus slows down and comes to a stop Almost
simultaneously a boy makes his appearance selling magazines

and candy

BOY
Here you are folks

Candydopopcornocigarettesomagazines6

As Ellie and Peter are seen again
the boy

ELLIE
Here boy

PETER
(turning to her)

she turns and calls to

Whatd you do Wire one of your

friends for money

ELLIE
(rummaging in her
purse)

No Itd be useless Fatherd get
the wire before they would

BOY
(as he enters)
Yes maam

ELLIE

A box of chocolates please

PETER
(to the boy)

Never mind son She doesnt want

(he gestures with
his thumb for the
boy to leave)

BOY
(puzzled)
But the lady saysdé

ELLIE

Of course I do What do you meando
PETER
(to the boy)
Beat it
(and the boy
frightened by his
voice leaves)

ELLIE
(resentfully)
You have your nerve
(she starts to rise)
Here boyd

Peter snatches the purse out of her hand and takes the
money out Ellie stares at him dumbfounded

PETER
A dollar sixty You had four
dollars last night How do you
expect to get to New York at the
rate youre going

ELLIE
(vehemently)
Thats none of your business

PETER
(with finality)
Youre on a budget from now on

(He flings her purse back at her and pockets the money)

ELLIE
Now just a minutedyou cantdo

PETER
Shut up

He returns to his magazine leaving her staring at him
petulantly as the scene FADES OUT

Part Four SOMEWHERE ON THE ROAD at night This is apparently
on the outskirts of a town Two local policemen and our

bus driver stand in the foreground near a police booth

The rain sweeps across their faces as they talk The
passengers in the bus which stands in the background

stick their heads out trying to hear what is going on

FIRST POLICEMAN
You wont be able to pass till

morning

SECOND POLICEMAN
Not even then if this keeps up

Peter approaches the group and is then seen with the
officers and the driver

PETER
Whats up

FIRST POLICEMAN
Bridge washed outdaround Dawson

DRIVER
Looks like we cant go through
till morning

SECOND POLICEMAN
(his only
contribution)
Not even then if this keeps up

FIRST POLICEMAN
Any of your passengers want a place
to sleepétheres an auto camp up
yonder a piece

PETER
(interested)
Yeah Where

FIRST POLICEMAN
(pointing)
Up yonder See the lights

PETER
Yeah

FIRST POLICEMAN
Thats it Dykes Auto Camp

PETER
Thanks

He dashes toward the bus Then he appears at the side door
of the bus

PETER

(calling)
Hey Bratdé

(he is about to

enter when he sees

Ellie)
The VIEW moves to the rear door of
the bus Ellie stands on the bottom
step

ELLIE
(haughtily)

Are you talking to me

PETER
Yeah Come ondwere stopping here
for the night

He disappears inside the bus through the side door With
an independent toss of her head Ellie turns and also enters
the bus but through the rear door

The scene DISSOLVES TO DYKES AUTO CAMP Ellie stands alone
on the porch of a small bungalow sheltered from the rain
Over her head is a sign reading

OFFICE-Dyke Auto Co6P D Dyke Prop

She looks about her restlessly giving the impression that
she has been waiting for someone Suddenly she is attracted
by something and gazes in its direction Then as seen by
Ellie in a LONG VIEW there appears about twenty yards
away a small cabin lighted on the inside and from it
Peter emerges accompanied by a mandopresumably Mr Dyke We
cannot hear what is being said from their movements
however it is apparent that an exchange of money is taking
place Dyke waves his hand in departure and starts toward
Ellie At the same time Peter calls to her

PETER

(shouting)
Hey Come on Were all set

(saying which he

enters the cabin)
Ellie hesitates a moment then
starts toward the cabin Now she
is hurrying across the open space
En route she passes Dyke

DYKE
(as they pass)
Good evening Hope you and your
husband rest comfortably

Ellie keeps on running but suddenly she stops dead and
looks back at Dyke following which a CLOSE-UP of ELLIE
shows her eyes opening wide with astonishment Her impulse
is to call Dyke back to make him repeat what he saiddéto
make certain she heard him correctly But Dyke is gone
and she turns and glances thoughtfully in the direction of
the cabin Then slowly the corners of her mouth screw up
in an attitude of cynicism So thats it is it He has
given her no previous evidence of being on the make yet
now with the first opportunityo Her thoughts however
are interrupted by Peters voice

PETERS VOICE
Well Bratowhat do you say

As she doesnt stir there appears a CLOSE-UP VIEW of PETER
standing in the doorway of the cabin looking toward Ellie
PETER
(impatiently)
Come on Come on What are you
going to do
Stand there all night
(he disappears inside)

For a long moment ELLIE is lost in speculation as to how
to proceed Then tossing her head defiantly with her
lips set grimly she starts toward the cabin until she
reaches it stops in the doorway and peers in As she does
this there is a VIEW OF THE INSIDE of the CABIN as SEEN
BY HER at the door Except for two cots on either side of
the room a few sticks of cane furniture a small table
upon which stands an oil burner for cooking the place is
barren At the moment Peter is attaching a clothes line
across the center of the room His suitcase is already
open And now Ellie steps inside surveying the place
contemptuously But Peter with his back to her is
oblivious of her presence and as he works he hums his
favorite melody Ellie finally breaks the silence

ELLIE
(sarcastically)
Darn clever these Armenians

PETER
(seen close as he
turns)

Yeah Yeah its a gift
(but he finishes
his hammering and
turns to his
suitcase)

ELLIE
(seen with Peter)
I just had the unpleasant sensation
of hearing you referred to as my
husband

PETER
(carelessly)
Oh I forgot to tell you I
registered as Mr and Mrs
(the matter-of-fact
way in which he
says this causes
her eyebrows to
lift)

ELLIE
Oh you did What am I expected to
dodleap for joy

PETER
I kind of half expected you to
thank me

ELLIE
Your ego is colossal

PETER
(blithely)
Yeah Yeah not bad Hows yours

There is silence for a moment and Peter proceeds with the
unpacking of his suitcase As she watches him Ellies
mood changes from one of anger to that of sarcasm

ELLIE

(appearing ina

CLOSE-UP her face

disdainful)
Compared to you my friend
Shapeleys an amateur

(sharply)
Whatever gave you an idea you can
get away with this Youre
positively the most conceitedd

PETERS VOICE

(interrupting)
Hey wait a minute

(appearing beside

her)
Lets get something straightened
out right now If youve any
peculiar ideas that Im interested
in you forget it Youre just a
headline to me

ELLIE
(frightened)
A headline Youre not a newspaper
man are you

PETER
Chalk up one for your side Now
listen you want to get to King
Westley dont you All right
Im here to help you What I want
is your story exclusive A day-to-
day account All about your mad
flight to happiness I need that
story Just between you and me
Ive got to have it

ELLIE
Now isnt that just too cute
Theres a brain behind that face
of yours isnt there Youve got
everything nicely figured out for
yourself including this
PETER

This Oh thats a matter of simple
mathematics These cabins cost two
bucks a night and Im very sorry
to inform you wifey dear but the
family purse wont stand for our
having separate establishments

(he goes back to

the business of

laying out his

things)

ELLIE
(starting to leave)

Well thank you Thank you very
much butd6 youve been very kind
(but the rain outside
causes her to

hesitate)

PETER
Oh yeah Its all right with me
Go on out in the storm but Im
going to follow you see Yeah
And if you get tough Ill just
have to turn you over to your old
man right now Savvy Now thats
my whole plot in a nutshell A
simple story for simple people
Now if you behave yourself Ill
see that you get to King Westley
if not Ill just have to spill
the beans to papa Now which of
these beds do you prefer This
one All right

While he speaks he has taken the extra blanket from the
cot and hung it over the clothes line This manages to
divide the room in half

A CLOSE VIEW at the door shows Ellie watching him with
interest

ELLIE
(sarcastically)
That I suppose makes
everythingéuhdquite all right

PETER

(the previous scene

returning)
Oh this6I like privacy when I
retire Im very delicate in that
respect Prying eyes annoy me

(he has the blanket

spread out now)
Behold the walls of Jericho 4
Maybe not as thick as the ones
that Joshua blew down with his
trumpet but a lot safer You see
I have no trumpet

(taking out pajamas
Now just to show you my hearts in
the right place Ill give you my
best pair of pajamas

He flings them over to her and she catches them and throws
them on her cot Throughout the scene she hasnt budged
from the door but Peter now prepares to undress

PETER
Do you mind joining the Israelites

ELLIE
Youre not really serious about
this are you

PETER

(seen at close range

going about the

job of undressing

very diffidently)
All right dont join the
Israelites Perhaps youre
interested in how a man undresses

(and he hangs his

coat over the chair)
Funny thing about that Quite a
study in psychology No two men do
it alike

(now his shirt is

coming off)

A CLOSE VIEW of ELLIE shows her standing stubbornly

PETERS VOICE
I once knew a chap who kept his
hat on until he was completely
undressed
(chuckling)
Made a comical picture

As the scene includes both of them Peter spreads his shirt
over his coat

PETER
Years later his secret came out

He wore a toupee

He lights a cigarette diffidently while she remains brazenly
watching him her eyes flashing defiantly

PETER
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own
Youll notice my coat came
firstéthen the tiedthen the
shirtonow according to Hoyle 5
the pants should come next But
thats where Im different

(he bends over)
go for the shoes first After that

ELLIE
(unable to stand it
any longer)
Smart aleck

And thoroughly exasperated she goes behind the blanket
and plops on the cot She sits on the edge debating what
to do feeling herself trapped Her impulse is to leave
if only to show this smart aleck hes not dealing with a
child and she rises impetuously and moves to the window

A CLOSE VIEW at the WINDOW shows her looking out The
downpour has not abated one bit and the heavy raindrops
clatter against the window pane in a sort of challenge to
Ellie whose jaw drops She turns slowly back to the room
and as she does so her eyes light on the cot It looks
most inviting after all she hasnt had any rest for two
nights She falls on the cot again her shoulders sagging
wearily Following this the VIEW reveals both sides of
the blanket Peter is already in his pajamas

PETER

Still with me Brat

(there is no answer

from Ellie)
Dont be a sucker A nights restll
do you a lot of good Besides
youve got nothing to worry about
The Walls of Jericho will protect
you from the big bad wolf

A CLOSE VIEW shows ELLIE glancing over at the blanket
Despite herself the suggestion of a smile flits across
her face

ELLIE
You havent got a trumpet by any
chance have you

PETER gets the idea and smiles broadly

PETER
Not even a mouth organ

Pulling the covers back he prepares to get into bed
humming as he does so
PETER
(humming to himself
Whos afraid of the big bad wolfé
The big bad wolf the big bad wolf
(louder)
Shes afraid of the big bad wolf
Tra-la-la-la-laé
(he springs into
bed)

Ellie smiles and wearily she pulls her hat off her head
She sits this way a moment thoughtfully then determined
she looks up

ELLIE
Do you mind putting out the light

PETER
Not at all
(He leans over and
snaps it off)

e room is thrown into darkness except for a stream of
ight coming in the window from the night-light outside

e camp Visible are Peters face and arms as he stares
eilingward while on Ellies side all we can see of her

s her silhouette except for such times as she gets in
irect line with the window There are glimpses of her as

e moves around in the process of undressing and we see
r rather sense her dress dropping to the floor She now
tands in her chemise this being white silk it stands

ut more prominently against the darkness She picks up

e pajamas and backs into a corner following which a
LOSE-UP of her head and shoulders shows her glancing
pprehensively toward Peters side of the room and holding
e pajamas in front of her with one hand with the other

e slips the strap off her shoulders She flings her slip
over the blanket

HOrtroaaQgrtononaratrey

PETER on his side of the room looks toward the blanket
and reacts to the Slip coming into sight Then other
undergarments join the slip on the blanket

PETER
(hoarsely)
Do you mind taking those things
off the Walls of Jericho
(a pause)
Its tough enough as it is

ELLIES VOICE
Oh excuse me
(and we see the
underthings flipped
off the blanket)

Ellies side of the room appears showing her crawling
quickly into bed pulling the covers over her and glancing
apprehensively in Peters directionoéfollowing which a CLOSE
VIEW shows PETER being very conscious of her proximity

The situation is delicate and dangerous the room is atingle
with sex He turns his gaze toward the blanket The VIEW
moves to the BLANKET remaining on it a moment It is a
frail barrier The VIEW then moves back to Peter whose
eyes are still on the blanket his face expressionless A
CLOSE VIEW of ELLIE next shows that she too has her

eyes glued on the blanket a little fearfully She turns
her head and gazes at the ceiling for a moment Then
suddenly her eyes widendand she sits up abruptly

ELLIES VOICE
(seriously)
Oh by the wayowhats your name

PETER
(seen close turning
his head toward
her)
Whats that

ELLIE
(both sides of the
blanket coming
into VIEW)
Who are you

PETER
Who me Why Im the whippoorwill
that cries in the night Im the
soft morning breeze that caresses
your lovely face

ELLIE
(interrupting)
Youve got a name havent you

PETER
Yeah I got a name Peter Warne

ELLIE
Peter Warne I dont like it

PETER
Dont let it bother you Youre
giving it back to me in the morning

ELLIE
(flopping back on
her pillow as she
mumbles)
Pleased to meet you Mr Warne

PETER
The pleasure is all mine
There is silence between them for a few seconds

Ellie doesnt like the implication

PETER
Ive been thinking about you

ELLIES VOICE
Yes

PETER

Youve had a pretty tough break at
that Twice a Missus and still

unkissed

direction as Peters voice continues

PETERS VOICE
(meaningly)

and glares in his

Ill bet youre in an awful hurry

to get back to New York aren

you

ELLIE
(hard)
Goodnight Mr Warne
(she turns over)

PETER
Goodnight

He also turns his head toward the wall

OUT

Part Five A LONG VIEW of the SKY

FADES IN

it comes nearer

t

and the scene FADES

in the early morning

In the dim distance there is a speck which as

turns out to be an airplane The drone of

its MOTORS becomes LOUDER and LOUDER Then the VIEW CUTS
TO the CONTROL COCKPIT of the PLANE revealing TWO PILOTS

FIRST PILOT
(shouting to other)
The old mans screwy

SECOND PILOT
(who cant hear him)
Whats ‘at

FIRST PILOT
(louder)
I said the old mans screwy

SECOND PILOT
(nodding his head
in agreement)
Yeah
FIRST PILOT
(cupping his mouth)

The dames too smart for him

SECOND PILOT
(nodding again
then leaning over)

Howd you like to be married to a

wild cat like that

The First Pilot grimaces in disgust

grabs his nose between

his fingers and goes through the motion of ducking under
water And as they both laugh the scene CUTS TO the CABIN
of the plane a privately built plane which has all the
equipment of a passenger ship Andrews and one of his
secretaries a conservative-appearing man of middle age
lean over a table This being a closed cabin the roar of
the motors scarcely interferes with the dialogue

SECRETARY
Heres another wire sir
ones from Charleston
(as there is a CLOSE
VIEW of the two)

This

Checking every northbound train
Also assigned twenty operatives to
watch main highways No success
yet Will continue to do everything
possible Signed Lovington
Detective Agency Charleston

ANDREWS
Any others

SECRETARY
Yessir
(holding up stack
of wires)

Theres a report here from every
State along the East coast Want

to hear them
ANDREWS
(impatiently)
What do they say

SECRETARY

Theyre practically all the same

sir
(he shrugs his
shoulders to
indicate there is
no news)

ANDREWS
(muttering)
Amateurs
SECRETARY
Theyre the finest detective agency
in the country sir

Andrews doesnt answer him He puffs furiously on his cigar
glances out of the window and turns irritably to a phone
by his side He snaps up the receiver and presses a button
following which the scene CUTS TO the CONTROL COCKPIT

where a light flashes on the instrument board and the
pilot picks up the receiver

PILOT
Yes sir

ANDREWS
(seen in the cabin)
I thought I made it clear I was in
a hurry to get to New York
(bellowing)
What are we crawling for

In the control cockpit the pilot reacts to the complaint
and glances at his speed indicator We then see the SPEED
INDICATOR registering 180 miles an hour The pilot looks
aghast

PILOT
(yelling into phone)
Weve got her wide open sir

ANDREWS
(irascibly)
Well step on it Step on it

He bangs up the receiver and stares moodily out of the
window It is plain that he is worried The VIEW then
includes his secretary Henderson

HENDERSON
I hope shes all right sir

ANDREWS
(sharply)
Of course shes all right What do
you think can happen

HENDERSON
(intimidated)
Nothing sir

ANDREWS
Then shut up about it

Thereupon the VIEW CUTS TO a CLOSE-UP of an airplane motor
in rapid motion and this DISSOLVES TO the AUTO CAMP CABIN
next morning a CLOSE VIEW showing ELLIE peacefully
sleeping But the drone of the plane overhead disturbs
her and she moves restlessly

ELLIE
(murmuring in her
sleep)
Darn planesé

She squirms around uncomfortably and finding it impossible
to resume her slumber opens her eyes The sun pouring in
through the window causes her to squint She sits up and
stares outside puzzled Then remembering where she is she
looks toward the other side of the cabin listening for
some sign of life But there is none and she relaxes She
falls back on the pillow pulling the covers over her

Now PETER enters from the outside with an armful of
foodstuffs which he dumps on the table He looks toward
Ellie

PETER
Heydéyou not up yet Come ondcome
on

ELLIES VOICE
What time is it

PETER
Eight oclock

He goes to the blanket which hangs between the two cots
and throws something over it to Ellie

PETER
Hered

ELLIE
(catching the package)

What is it

(opening the package)

Why its a toothbrush Thanks
(noticing her dress
hanging freshly
pressed)

Youdyou had it pressed

PETER
(getting things
ready for breakfast)
Come on Hurry up Breakfastll be
ready in no time

ELLIE
Why you sweet thing you Whered
you get it pressed
(at this the VIEW
moves with him and
he goes to the
blanket)

PETER
Listen BratoIm going to count to
ten If youre not out of bed by
then Im going to yank you out
myself

A CLOSE VIEW of ELLIE shows her being stubborn but alarmed

PETERS VOICE
(counting quickly)
ONEOTWOOTHREEOFOUROFIVE

ELLIE
(panic-stricken)
Why you bully I believe you would

PETERS VOICE
osixosevendeightdonined

ELLIE
(screaming)
Im out Im out

And she jumps out of bed throwing the cover around herself
following which Peter is SEEN going back to the table

PETER
Youll find the showersdand
thingsoright back of the second
cottage
(at this Ellie sticks
her head over the
blanket)

ELLIE
(aghast)
Outside

PETER
Certainly outside All the best
homes have em outside

ELLIE
I cant go out like this

PETER
Like what

ELLIE
Like this I have no robe

PETER
Heredtake mine
He flings his robe over to her and she disappears behind
the blanket

PETER
But make it snappy

Now Ellie has got into his robe and appears on his side
The robe is too large for her and she makes a comical
figure As she enters she tries to maintain her customary
dignity

ELLIE
(dignifiedly)
Whered you say the showersdand
thingsdowere
(Peter turns when
he sees her he
laughs)

PETER
(appraisingly)
Heyoyoure little arent you

ELLIE
Where is the shower

PETER
Your hairs cute like that You
should never comb it

ELLIE
(leaving haughtily)
Ill find it myself

She slams the door viciously but Peter rushes over to the
window to watch her and as VIEWED by him Ellie appears
next walking to the showers outside the cabin She holds
her head high and struggles valiantly to maintain as much
dignity as she can muster under the circumstances Then in
the cabin at the window Peter watching Ellie chuckles

at her shaking his head in amusement He starts toward

the table and the scene CUTS TO a moving VIEW outside the
cabins with Ellie walking past several cottages on her

way to the showers Several people stop to stare at her
until she reaches her destination There are two wooden
shacks adjoining each having a sign on them one reads
ShowersOMen6the other ShowersoWomen In front of the
womens shower there are several unappetizing-looking fat
women waiting and with them is a small girl Ellie crosses
over to the womens shower and disappears inside the
waiting women staring at her puzzled A moment elapses

and Ellie backs out being pushed by a woman part of whose
naked body is visible and whose voice is heard in protest

WOMAN
Cant a body have some privacy
around here
The women who are waiting chuckle at Ellies embarrassment
as she stands aside They certainly are making a monkey
out of her decorum The little girl keeps eyeing Ellie
fascinated

LITTLE GIRL
(pointing)
Dont she look funny Mama

Ellie wheeling on the little girl crushes her with a
devastating look so that the little girl cringes against
her mothers skirt Ellie goes to the end of the line to
await her turn following which CLOSE-UPs show the LITTLE
GIRL slowly turning her head to look at Ellie and ELLIE
noticing the little girl staring at her whereupon Ellie
sticks her tongue out at her And in a scene which includes
both the little girl retaliates by sticking her tongue

out also

This DISSOLVES TO a VIEW of ELLIE coming out of the showers
At the same time Shapeley comes out of the mens shower
and upon seeing Ellie his face lights up

SHAPELEY
Hello sister

Ellie ignores him and walks toward her cabin But Shapeley
falls into step with her

SHAPELEY
Sorry about last night Didnt
know you were married to that guy
Shoulda told me about it right
off
(he chuckles)

There I was gettin myself all
primed for a killin and you turn
out to be an old married woman

e scene CUTS TO the door of PETERS CABIN as Peter comes
ut stands in the doorway and is surprised to see Ellie
nd Shapeley who are then SEEN (FROM HIS ANGLE) talking
ereupon PETER is seen again as his lip curls up a little
ealously he returns to the cabin following which we
gain see Ellie and Shapeley walking He notices the robe
e is wearing and he looks down toward her feet the

IEW moving down to show Ellies legs and feet The pajama
egs are seen protruding below the robe the cuffs of which
e has turned up Then the VIEW moving back up to Ellie
and Shapeley he lifts her robe playfully

OrRQHneuUHAOH

SHAPELEY
Hey whats this Wearing Papas
things Now thats cute Thats
what I call real lovey-dovey
Yessir
ELLIE
(stoppingdher eyes
blazing)
If you dont get out of here Ill
slap that fresh mouth of yours

SHAPELEY
(startled)
SorryoI didnt mean tod

ELLIE
(sharply)
Get out

SHAPELEY
Okay I was just trying to make
conversation

Ellie leaves him abruptly and the scene CUTS TO the CABIN
where Peter is now busy setting the small table Ellie
enters after a moment while Peter has his back to the
door

PETER
(without turning)
High time you got back

ELLIE
I met some very interesting women
at the showers We got to chatting
about this and that You know how
time files

She disappears behind the blanket following which we see
Peters side of the cabin while Ellies voice continues
from behind the blanket

ELLIES VOICE
We must come back to this place
often You meet the nicest people

Her head bobs up over the blanket now and again as she
dresses

ELLIE
I saw the little Pussinfoos girl
Shes turned out quite a charming
creature

Peter ignores her chatter except for an annoyed glance
once in a while

ELLIE
Very outspoken too Said I looked
funny Wasnt that cute
PETER

Hurry up and get dressed

ELLIE

(sticking her head
over blanket)

Why Peter

Dont you want to hear

about our lovely friends

PETER

If you didnt waste so much time
on that wise-cracking drummerdéwed
have been through with breakfast
by this time

A CLOSE VIEW shows ELLIE in the process of buttoning her

dress She looks up

having recognized a tinge of jealousy

in his voice which intrigues her She starts to the other

side of the blanket
part of the cabin

Then we see her joining Peter in his

ELLIE

Well I hope youre not going to
dictate whom I can talk to

PETER

I know a couple of truck drivers
Id like to have you meet sometime
(setting a plate
for her)
Come on sit down

Thank you

ELLIE

(sitting down to
the table referring
to the food)

My my Scrambled eggs

PETER

Egg One eggddoughnutséblack coffee
Thats your ration till lunch Any

complaints

ELLIE

(cheerily)
Nope No complaints

PETER

Id have gotten you some cream but
it meant buying a whole pint

ELLIE

(sweetly)
Why you dont have to apologize

Mr Warne

Youll never know how

much I appreciate all this
PETER
(gruffly)
What makes you so disgustingly
cheerful this morning

ELLIE
Must be the Spring

PETER
I thought maybeduhébelieve you

stories

ELLIE
He apologized for last night
(carelessly)
Said he didnt know we were married

PETER
(passing her a
doughnut)
Just shows you how wrong a guy can
be Doughnut

ELLIE
Thanks
(embarrassed)
You think this whole business is
silly dont you I mean running
away and everything

PETER
(easily)
No No Its too good a story

ELLIE
Yes you do You think Im a fool
and a spoiled brat Perhaps I am
although I dont see how I can be
People who are spoiled are
accustomed to having their own
way I never have On the contrary
Ive always been told what to do
and how to do it and where and
with whom Would you believe it
This is the first time Ive ever
been alone with a man

PETER
Yeah

ELLIE
Its a wonder Im not panic

stricken

PETER
Um Youre doing all right

ELLIE
Thanks Nurses governesses
chaperones even body-guards Oh
its been a lot of fun

PETER
One consolation you can never be
lonesome

ELLIE
It has its moments It got to be a
sort of game to try to outwit
fathers detectives I6I did it
once actually went shopping without
a body-guard It was swell I felt
absolutely immoral But it didnt
last long They caught up with me
in a department store I was so
mad I ran out the back way and
jumped into the first car I saw
Guess who was in it

PETER
Santa Claus

ELLIE
KingdKing Westley was in it

PETER
Oh Is that how you met him

ELLIE

Um-hm We rode around all afternoon
Father was frantic By 6 oclock
he was having all the rivers
dragged

(she has been

dunking her

doughnut throughout

this Peter watching

her)

PETER
Say where did you learn to dunk
in finishing school

ELLIE
(indignantly)
Aw now dont you start telling
me I shouldnt dunk

PETER
Of course you shouldnt You dont
know how to do it Dunkings an
art Dont let it soak so long A
dip and plop into your mouth If
you let it soak so long itll get
soft and fall off Its all a matter
of timing I ought to write a book
about it

ELLIE
Thanks professor

PETER
Just goes to show you Twenty
millions and you dont know how to
dunk

ELLIE
Id change places with a plumbers
daughter any day

But before he can answer they are interrupted by voices
directly outside their window and the VIEW MOVES WITH
PETER as he goes to the door which he opens slightly
Thereupon Dyke is SEEN in conversation with two men outside
the CABIN

DYKE
(protesting loudly)
You cant go around bothering my
tenants I tell you theres no
girl by that name here Besides
how do I know youre detectives

FIRST DETECTIVE
Show him your credentials Mac
Ill look around

At this Peter closes the door and turns to Ellie

PETER
Detectives

ELLIE
(petrified)
Thats Father at work Whatll I
do
(appealingly to
him)
Peter whatll I do

PETER
Dont look at me I didnt marry
King Westley

Ellie runs around the room picking up her stuff and
murmuring Oh my goodness She reaches the window

ELLIE
(now seen close at
the window)
Maybe I could jump out of the
window

(tremulously)
Do you think theyd see me

PETERS VOICE
(suddenly)
Come here you little fool

She starts toward him We then see him plunking her ina
chair

PETER
Sit down

He rumples her hair and sticks a few hairpins in her mouth
He now stands aside and deliberately talks loud enough to
be heard outside

PETER
(practically shouting)
Yeah I got a letter from Aunt
Betty She says if we dont stop
over at Wilkes-Barre shell never
forgive us

ELLIE
(a CLOSE-UP showing
her staring at him
in bewilderment)
What are you talking about

At this Peter rushes over to her and clamps his hand over
her mouth

PETER
(with his hand over
her mouth)
The baby is due next monthdand
they want us to come

Ellie looks up at him and realizes what hes doing she
nods to him that its all right whereupon he removes his
hand from her mouth And now one of the detectives
approaches the FRONT DOOR of the cabin When he hears
Peters voice he stops to listen

PETERS VOICE
She says she saw your sister Ethel
the other day and shes looking
swell

The detective knocks on the door At this we again see

inside of the cabin as Peter whispers to Ellie to say Come
in

ELLIE
(calling)
Come in

The moment she does Peter rushes behind the hanging
blanket He has his head stuck over it waiting for the
detective to enter and the moment the door opens Peter
ducks The detective takes a step inside the room

PETERS VOICE
(from behind blanket)
I hope Aunt Betty has a boy dont
you Shes always wanted a boy I
think well stop over in Wilkes-
Barre this trip darling Give the
family a treat

A CLOSE VIEW shows Ellie and the detective They have been
staring at each other

ELLIE
(very sweet calling
to Peter)
Theres a man here to see you
Sweetheart

PETERS VOICE
Whodme
(appearing from
behind the blankets
pleasantly)
Want to see me

DETECTIVE
(who hasnt taken
his eyes off Ellie)
Whats your name

ELLIE
(innocently)
Are you addressing me

DETECTIVE
Yeah Whats your name

PETER
(stepping in front
of him)
Hey wait a minute Youre talking
to my wife You cant walk in here
andéwhat do you want anyway

DETECTIVE
Were looking for somebody

PETER
Well look your head offdébut dont
come bustin in here This isnt a
public park

While Peter has been speaking the second detective and
Dyke have entered They walk over to Peter the First
Detective and Ellie

PETER
I got a good mind to sock you right
in the nose

FIRST DETECTIVE
Take it easy son Take it easy

SECOND DETECTIVE
(crowding forward)
Whats up

The Second Detectives eyes fall on Ellie and he stops to
stare at her suspiciously He takes a photograph out of
his pocket which he inspects

DYKE
(explains)
These men are detectives Mr Warne

PETER
(shouting)
I wouldnt care if they were the
whole police department They cant
come in here and start shooting
questions at my wife

ELLIE
(appearing very
domestic)
Dont get excited Peter They
just asked a civil question

PETER
(turning on her
very sarcastic)
There you go again How many times
did I tell you to stop butting in
when I have an argument

ELLIE
(sharply entering
into the spirit of
the pretense)
Well you dont have to lose your
temper

PETER
(mimicking her)
You dont have to lose your temper
(in his own voice)
Thats what you told me the last
time too Every time I step in to
protect you At the Elks dance7
when that big Swede made a pass at
youo

ELLIE
He didnt make a pass at me I
told you a million times

The two detectives and Dyke are seen watching the other
two who are now out of sight

PETERS VOICE
(screaming)
Oh no I saw him He kept pawing
you all over the dance floor

ELLIES VOICE
He didnt You were drunk

PETER
(now seen with Ellie)
Oh so now I was drunk

ELLIE
Well you were

PETER
Im sorry I didnt take another
sock at him

ELLIE
Yeah and gotten yourself arrested

PETER
Aw nuts Youre just like your
old man Once a plumber always a
plumber There isnt an ounce of
brains in your whole family

ELLIE
(starting to cry)
Peter Warne youve gone far enough
I wont stand being insulted like
this another minute

Ellie goes over to her cot and starts picking up her hat
and things whereupon Dyke very much affected turns to
the detectives

DYKE
Now look what youve done

FIRST DETECTIVE
(apologetically)
Sorry Mr Warne But you see
were supposed to check up on
everybody

SECOND DETECTIVE
Were looking for a girl by the
name of Ellen Andrews You knowdthe
daughter of the big Wall Street
mug

A CLOSE-UP of ELLIE appears as their voices are heard

FIRST DETECTIVES VOICE
Your wife sure looks like her
Dont she Mac

SECOND DETECTIVES VOICE
She sure does

PETER
(the entire group
coming into VIEW)
Well I hope you find her
(to Ellie)
Quit bawling Quit bawling

The detectives start out accompanied by Dyke who is still
concerned about the disturbing of his tenants As they
disappear out the door we HEAR Dykes voice

DYKES VOICE
I told you they were a perfectly
nice married couple

Their voices die Peter stands in the middle of the room
watching them go From her side where she has been
stalling Ellie peers out of the window until the detectives
vanish She starts toward Peter Then they appear together
both staring out until the detectives are well out of sight
Finally Peter closes the door and turns to her

PETER
(seriously)
Itll be a dirty trick on Aunt
Betty if it turns out to be a girl
after all

This brings laughter from them both But Peter suddenly
sobers and he looks at her thoughtfully

PETER
Say you were pretty good Jumping
in like that Got a brain havent

ELLIE
You werent so bad yourself
PETER
We could start a two-person stock
company If things get toughdéwe

ELLIE

PETER

ELLIE
I refuse to resign

PETER
Then Ill fire you Ill do all
the parts myself

They are interrupted by the door being flung open Dyke
sticks his head in the door

DYKE
Your bus leaves in five minutes

PETER
Holy jumpingd We havent started
to pack yet

And they both scurry around throwing things carelessly
into Peters suitcase as the scene fades out

LOVINGTON

ace awe-inspiring in its dignified furnishings
Ive put extra men on all along
the way

ANDREWS

(suddenly)
Are you certain shes not with
King Westley

LOVINGTON
No Hes been trailed twenty-four
hours a day since this thing
started He cant even get a phone
call we dont know about

ANDREWS

(who has been

pressing several

buttons on his

desk)
Im worried Lovington After all
something might have happened to
her

(he is interrupted

by the entrance of

several employees)

ONE OF THEM
Yessir

ANDREWS

(seeing them)
Oh Clarkéwant you to arrange for
a radio broadcastéright awaydcoast
to coast hook-up Offer a reward
of ten thousand dollars for any
information leading to her
whereabouts

CLARK
(leaving)

Yessir

ANDREWS
Brownd

BROWN
Yessir

ANDREWS
Send the story out to the
newspapers

(he rips a picture
of Ellie on the
desk out of its
frame)
Some of the out of town papers may
not have a picture of her Heredowire
this to theméI want it to break
right away

As he hands the picture to Brown the VIEW moves in to a
CLOSE-UP of the PICTURE which dissolves to a CLOSE-UP of
the same PICTURE in a NEWSPAPER and as the VIEW draws
slowly back we see the headline over it which reads

DAUGHTER OF BANKER DISAPPEARS TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS REWARD

The VIEW THEN DRAWS BACK to reveal SHAPELEY reading the
newspaper He stares long and absorbedly at the picture
Then slowly he turns his head toward the rear of the bus
and the VIEW following his gaze passes a group of men
singing The Man On the Flying Trapeze They are huddled
together and accompanied by a man who plays a guitar
Then the VIEW CONTINUES MOVING until it reaches Peter and
Ellie who join in the song and a CLOSE-UP of ELLIE shows
her eyes sparkling as she sings gaily

SHAPELEY looks back at Ellie and apparently comes to the
conclusion that his suspicions are correct for he quickly
folds the newspaper casting a surreptitious glance around
to make certain he is not being watched A diabolical smirk
spreads over his face

A FULL VIEW of the interior of the bus shows most of the
occupants joining in the fun singing They seem unmindful
of the discomfiture caused by the rocking of the bus which
throws them against each other Then the VIEW draws in to

a front seat in which sit a woman and a small boy of ten
The womans face is haggard and she sways uncertainly her
eyes half closed Her small sons frightened face peers up
at her

BOY
(in a trembling
voice)
Whatsa matter Ma Dont you feel
all right

The woman struggles valiantly to recover her composure
She presses her sons small hand in a feeble effort at
assurance

A CLOSE VIEW of Ellie and Peter shows ELLIE singing more
boisterously than the rest doing the comical song with
exaggerated gestures But suddenly her face clouds at
something she SEES

ELLIE
(touching Peters
arm)
Peter
(as he turns)
Theres something the matter with
that woman She looks ill

Peter follows her gaze whereupon we see the WOMAN Her
head rolls weakly a pained expression on her face

ELLIE
(again seen with
Peter
sympathetically)
I better go over and see her

PETER
Dont be silly Nothing you can
do Must be tough on an old womanda
trip like this

ELLIE
(worried)
Yes

We SEE the OTHER PASSENGERS around Ellie and Peter enjoying
themselves One of them pokes her

MAN
Hey Galli-Curci 9 come ondget
onto it
(poking Peter)
You too McCormack

Ellie and Peter snap into it they are just in time for
the long wail which precedes the chorus

ELLIE AND PETER
(singing)

OQ-o-o-ohéHe flies through the air

with the

greatest of eased

This daring young man on the flying

trapezeo

At this the scene CUTS TO the ROAD The bus is caught in a
muddy road full of ruts and at the moment wavers
dangerously at an angle The left front wheel is stuck in

a deep hole and the engine roars and clatters as the driver
feeds the gas Finally the bus moves forward extricating
the wheel but just as it does the right front wheel falls
into another mud hole on the other side and this time the
bus seems hopelessly stuck a CLOSE-UP of the RIGHT WHEEL
showing it revolving desperately but in vain The mud
splashes in all directions and the wheel seems to sink
deeper and deeper Thereupon this VIEW CUTS TO the inside
of the BUS The bus is tilted over at an extreme angle
which has thrown Ellie into a corner on the floor where
she now crouches in an undignified position She looks

like a turtle her head being invisible

ELLIE
(sticking her head

out)
Thank the man for me Peter This
is the first comfortable position
Ive had all night

Peter amused is assisting her to her feet The guitarist
has continued his playing uninterrupted and as Peter lifts
Ellie he sings

PETER
(singing)
She flies through the air with
the greatest of ease
This darin young maid on the flying
trapezed

(GRUNTING)
Her movements are gracefuldéall men
does she pleasedé

A CLOSE VIEW of the WOMAN and the LITTLE BOY now shows the
latter terrifiedly watching his mother whose head sags
wearily Finally she topples forward in a swoon

BOY
(with a moan)
Ma Ma Whatsa matter with you
(tears stream down
his cheeks)
Somebody help me Somethins
happened to her

The MUSIC STOPS abruptly Everyone looks up startled
Ellie starts forward followed by Peter Passengers closely
group around the woman and chatter Shes fainted Look
how pale she is

Peter and Ellie step up

PETER
Get some water somebody

(TO THE BOY)
Let me get in here son

Ellie goes out of sight to get water The boy cries audibly
terror-stricken but gets out of Peters way and Peter
lifts the woman up and stretches her across the seat Ellie
comes back with water which she silently hands to Peter

who administers to the woman and when she slowly opens her
eyes makes her drink the water The woman looks around
bewildered

PETER
(consolingly)
Thats better Youre all right
now Just took a little nose-dive
thats all

He assists her in sitting up The boys wailing is heard
and he now rushes over and throws his arms around his
mother

BOY
(crying)
Madoh gee Mad

His mother clings to him but still feeling faint her
head sways Peter looks up at Ellie and gives her a sign
to sit down beside the woman ELLIE sits down beside her
Peter takes the boy by the shoulders

PETER
Come on son Better give your
mother a chance to snap out of it
(as the boy emits a
heart-breaking sob)
Its all right son Shell be
okay in a couple of minutes

He leads the boy away while Ellie places her arm around
the woman

ELLIE
Youd better rest Its been a
ard trip hasnt it

The scene CUTS TO a CLOSE VIEW of SHAPELEY who has his eye
peeled on Peter watching him and we next SEE Peter and

the boy who is still sobbing quietly They are now standing
away from the other passengers

BOY
We aint ate nothin since
yestidday

PETER

What happened to your money

BOY

Ma spent it all for the tickets
She didnt know it was gonna be so
much

(with a new outburst)
We shouldna come I guess but Ma
said theres a job waitin for her
in New Yorkéand if we didnt go
she might lose it

PETER
Going without food is bad business
son Why didnt you ask somebody
BOY
I was gonna do it but Ma wouldnt
let me She was ashamed I guess

Peter reaches into his pocket for a bill just as Ellie
approaches them

ELLIE
Shell be all right soons she
gets something to eat

Peter has extracted a single bill and dips in his pocket
for a smaller one Before he can find anything however
Ellie takes the one he has in his hand and gives it to the
boy

ELLIE
Here boyéfirst town we come to
buy some food

(Peter glances at the empty hand and then at Ellie)

BOY
I shouldnt oughta take this Mall
be angry
ELLIE
(confidentially)

Just dont tell her anything about
it You dont want her to get sick
again do you

BOY
(a sob in his voice)
No-o But I shouldnt oughta take
the money
(to Peter)
You might need it

PETER
Me Forget it son
(rumples his
hairdsmiling)
I got millions

BOY
(also smiling)
Thanks

ELLIE
(her arm around the
boy)
Come on Lets go back to your
mother

She leaves with the boy Peter watching her a moment
impressed by her display of humanness before turning and
leaving the scene following which a CLOSE-UP shot of
SHAPELEY watching Peter then also rising and starting
out

On the ROAD the driver is now standing in front of the
mud-hole staring at the sunken wheel dolefully as several
people stray into the scene

DRIVER
That storm sure made a mess outa
these roads

PETER
(appearing and
seeing the trouble)
Holy Smokes Youll never get out
yourself Better phone for some

help
DRIVER
Phone for help
(unhappily)

Were right in the middle of
nowhere There isnt a town within
ten miles of here

Shapeley is just entering the outskirts of the group He
stops looks in the direction of Peter speculatively He
has the newspaper stuck in his pocket which he caresses
tenderly The scene expanding Peter is then seen leaving
the group

SHAPELEY
(as Peter approaches)
Whats up
PETER

Looks like were going to be stuck
for a long time
(he starts away)

SHAPELEY
(calling to him)
Say Buddyfi

Peter turns and looks at him quizzically and the two are
then seen close together

SHAPELEY
Like to have a look at my paper

He has taken it out and has it opened as he hands it to
Peter The headlines concerning Ellie and her picture shriek
out at Peter This startles him for a moment but he manages
to recover his poise

SHAPELEY
Travelin like this you kinda
lose track of whats goin on in
the world

PETER
(guardedly)
Thanks
(he glances from
the newspaper to
Shapeley wondering
how much he suspects)

SHAPELEY
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays
you gotta keep in touch with all
the news is what I always say

PETER

(eyeing him

expectantly)
Thats right

SHAPELEY
(pointing to paper)
Take that story there for instance
Be kinda sweet if we could collect
that ten thousand smackers

PETER
(non-committally)
Yeahdowouldnt it

SHAPELEY
Its a lotta dough If I was to
run across that dame you know
what Id do

PETER
What

SHAPELEY
Id go fifty-fifty with you

PETER
Why

SHAPELEY

say

PETER
Whats on your mind

SHAPELEY
(hard)
Five Gséor I crab the works

PETER
Youre a pretty shrewd baby
(looking around)
We better get away from this gang
Talk this thing over privately

And the VIEW MOVES WITH THEM as Peter leads the way toward
a CLUMP OF BUSHES off the side of the road Shapeley
following They are concealed from the rest of the
passengers

PETER
Lucky thing my running into you
Just the man I need

SHAPELEY
(smiling broadly)
Youre not making any mistake
believe you me

PETER
I can use a smart guy like you

SHAPELEY
(expansively)
Say listen when youre talkin to
old man Shapeley youre talking
tod

PETER
(suddenly)
Do you pack a gat11 A CLOSE
VIEW of the TWO shows the smile
dying on Shapeleys face He looks
up quickly

SHAPELEY
Huh

PETER
A gat A gat
(feeling him)
Got any fireworks on you

SHAPELEY
(weakly)
Whydnod

PETER

(carelessly)
Thats all right I got a couple
of machine guns in my suitcase
Ill let you have one of them

(Shapeley is beginning to realize he is in for something
he hadnt bargained for and stares speechlessly at Peter
who continues blandly)

Expect a little trouble up North May have to shoot it out
with cops

The perspiration starts appearing on Shapeleys brow (as
we SEE him in a CLOSE-UP) Peters voice continues

PETERS VOICE
(with emphasis)
If you come through all right
your five Gs are in the bag Maybe
more Ill talk to the Killerdésee
that he takes care of you

SHAPELEY
(finally finding
his voice)
The Killer

PETER
(seen with Shapeley
watching the latter
to gauge the effect
of his words)

(shakily)

PETER

silently as if

SHAPELEY

PETER

SHAPELEY

(grabbing Peters
hand and shaking
it gratefully)
Oh thanks thanks Mister I always
knew you guys were kind-hearted

PETER
(putting his hand
away)
Come on scram And stay away from
that bus

SHAPELEY
Sure Anything you say

As he says this he backs away from Peter following which
a CLOSE-UP of PETER shows a twinkle in his eye and then

AS SEEN BY PETER Shapeley appears walking hurriedly away
When he thinks the distance is safe he starts running He
slips and falls in the mud picks himself up and continues
his race for life

The scene DISSOLVES TO the ROAD at night with Ellie and
Peter walking along It is apparent they have been trudging
like this for a long time

ELLIE
Poor old Shapeley You shouldnt
have frightened him like that

PETER
At the rate he started hes
probably passed two state lines by
this time The exercise is good
for him

ELLIE
Yes I noticed he was getting a
little fat lately
(she grabs her side)
Ouch

PETER
Whats the matter

ELLIE
(grimacing)
I was never built for these
moonlight strolls
(protesting)
Why did we have to leave the bus

PETER
I dont trust that chatterbox

The scene DISSOLVES TO the banks of a narrow STREAM at
night Peter is bending over removing his shoes and we
see the two closer as they talk
PETER
First town we hit in the morning
you better wire your father

ELLIE
Not as long as Im alive

PETER
Okay with me if you can stand the
starvation diet

ELLIE
What do you meandéstarvation

PETER
It takes money to buy food

ELLIE
Why havent youd

PETER
(interrupting)
Not a sou I had some before the
fainting scene

ELLIE
You didnt give that boy all your
money

PETER
I didnt give him anything You
were the big-hearted gal How about
wiring your father now

ELLIE
Never Ill get to New York if I
have to starve all the way

PETER

(risingduttering a

deep sigh)
Must be some strange power Westley
has over you women

(he now has his

shoes off and ties

them to each other)
How do you expect to get there

ELLIE
To New York

PETER
Yeah

ELLIE

Im following you
PETER
Arent you afraid of me

ELLIE
(confidently)
No

PETER
(looking at her)
Okay Hang on to these

As he bends down in front of Ellie he gets a firm grip
around her legs and throws her over his shoulder like a
sack She squeals terrified but Peter ignores this and
with his right hand which is free he lifts the suitcase
and starts walking across the stream Ellies first fright
is gone and she now rather enjoys the sensation of being
carried by Peter She lets herself go completely limp
still clinging to his shoes which she carries by the
string As they walk the dangling shoes keep hitting
Peters backside

PETER
I wish youd stop being playful

ELLIE
(thereupon holding
the shoes out at a
safe distance)
Sorry
(Peter takes several
more laborious
steps before either
of them speaks)
Its the first time Ive ridden
piggy-back in years

PETER
This isnt piggy-back

ELLIE
Of course it is

PETER
Youre crazy

ELLIE
(after a silence
for several seconds)
remember distinctly Father taking
me for a piggy-back rided

PETER
And he carried you like this I
suppose

ELLIE
Yes

PETER
(with finality)
Your father didnt know beans about
piggy-back riding

ELLIE
(another silence
before she speaks

again)
My uncleéMothers brotherdéhad four
children and Ive seen them

ride piggy-back

PETER
I dont think theres a piggy-
back rider in your whole family
I never knew a rich man yet who
was a good piggy-back rider

ELLIE
Thats silly

PETER
To be a piggy-backer it takes
complete relaxationéa warm heartdéand
a loving nature

ELLIE
And rich people have none of those
qualifications I suppose

PETER
Not a one

ELLIE
Youre prejudiced

PETER

Show me a good piggy-back rider
and Ill show you somebody thats
human Take Abraham Lincoln for
instancedéa natural piggy-backer

(contemptuously)
Where do you get off with your
stuffed-shirt family

(turning)
Why your father knew so much about
piggy-back riding that hed

In his excitement he wheels around to speak to her
forgetting that as he turns she goes with him Not finding
her at his right he swings around to his left Naturally
he takes Ellie with himdand realizing his mistake he
mutters
PETER
Aw nuts

He proceeds on his way walking faster than before They
continue this way silently for some time Finally Ellie
breaks the silence

ELLIE
(persistently)
My father was a great piggy-
backer

Peter raises his eyes heavenward in thorough disgust then
calmly hands his suitcase to her

PETER
Hold this a minute

Ellie takes the suitcase from him and his hand now free
he delivers a resounding smack on her backside so that
Ellie lets out a yelp

PETER
(taking the suitcase)
Thank you

The scene DISSOLVES TO the edge of a cow PASTURE at night
and Ellie and Peter are revealed climbing under a barbed
wire fence following which the scene DISSOLVES TO a
HAYSTACK in front Peter sets his bag down and surveys
the layout Ellie watching him

PETER
(to himself)
This looks like the best spot

ELLIE
Were not going to sleep out here
are we

PETER

I dont know about you but Im
going to give a fairly good
imitation of it

And he busies himself laying out a bed for her pulling
hay from the stack and spreading it out on the ground
Ellie wanders aim-lessly and then moves to a rock where
she sits and watches Peter

ELLIE
(after a pause
coyly)
Peterd
PETER

(as a CLOSE VIEW
shows him still
arranging her bed
grumbling)

What

ELLIES VOICE
Im hungry

PETER
(without looking up)
Just your imagination

ELLIE
(seen at the rock
while Peter is out

of sight)
No it isnt Im hungry andoand
scared

PETERS VOICE
You cant be hungry and scared at
the same time

ELLIE
(insisting)
Well I am
PETER

(as both he and

Ellie are seen in

their respective

places)
If youre scared it scares the
hunger out of you

ELLIE
(argumentatively)
Not if youre more hungry than
scared
PETER
(impatiently)
All right You win Lets forget
it
ELLIE

(after a pause)
I cant forget it Im still hungry

PETER
(tearing his hair
screaming)
Holy Smokes Why did I ever get
mixed up with you

This brings silence and he goes on building a bed for
her Then a CLOSE-UP of Ellie shows her watching him Her
eyes soften A very definite interest in him is slowly but
surely blossoming and the fact that he is making her bed
adds to the intimacy of the scene A CLOSE VIEW of PETER
shows him concentrating on his task but he pauses a moment
and turns to glance at her It is a devouring look which
he quickly dispels by working more feverishly on her bed

PETER

(muttering while he

works)
If I had any sense Id have been
in New York by this time

(he emphasizes his

feelings by yanking

viciously at the

hay as both of

them are now seen)
Taking a married woman back to her
husband Hunh What a prize sucker
I turned out to be

(He has her bed

ready without

glancing at her)
Come ondoyour beds all ready

She watches him a moment then rising slowly starts toward
Peter Then she stands over her bed surveying it
speculatively

ELLIE
Ill get my clothes all wrinkled

PETER
(sharply)
Well take them off

ELLIE
(shocked)
What

PETER

(shouting)

All right Dont take them off Do
whatever you please But shut up
about it

She flashes him a petulant offended glance but it is lost
on Peter who has his back to her and meticulously she
slips to her knees and proceeds to stretch out on the hay
The hay bed is bumpy and hard and she has quite a difficult
time getting comfortable her efforts to do so are
accompanied by painful sighs A CLOSE VIEW shows PETER
stopping to watch her and his look is sympathetic and
solicitous Then while Ellie groans and sighs and pounds
the hay with her palm Peter steps out of sight Ellie is
unaware of his departure so busily occupied is she with
her makeshift bedding She squirms around unhappily and

finally stretches out deciding to make the best of it
She lies on her back her hands clasped under her head

looking up at the stars

ELLIE

(seen CLOSE as she

is lying back on

hay bed)
Youre becoming terribly
disagreeable lately Snap my head
off every time I open my mouth

(She waits fora

reply but receives

none)
If being with me is so distasteful
to you you can leave

(independently)
You can leave any time you see
fit Nobodys keeping you her

(martyr-like)
I can get along

She waits a second and then turns to see what effect this
has on him The fact that Peter is gone doesnt quite
register at first She looks around calmly then is puzzled
and finally she becomes panicky She sits up with a start

ELLIE

(murmuring
frightened)

Peterd
(there is a pause
while she listens
but nothing stirs
and there is more
apprehension in
her voice)

Peter

Real terror comes into her face and she is ready to cry

She gets to her feet

ELLIE
(with a terrified
outcry)
Peter

At this he comes running into the scene
has a watermelon

PETER
Whats the matter

ELLIE
(relieved)
Oh Peterd
(she throws her

under his arm he
arms around his
neck and sobs freely)

PETER
(hoarsely)
Whats got into you

ELLIE
(clinging to him)
Oh Peter I was so scared

With his free hand he removes her arm from around his neck
and starts away

PETER
(setting the
watermelon down)
I wasnt gone more than a minute
Just went out to find you something

to eat
ELLIE
(a sob still in her
voice)
knowdébutd
PETER

(kicking the melon
over to her)
Here Eat your head off

ELLIE
I dont want it now

PETER
(vehemently)
Thought you were hungry

ELLIE
wasdobut6

PETER
But what

ELLIE

was so scaredéthat it scaredé

PETER
(exasperatedly)
Holy Jumping Catfish You can drive
a guy crazy

He kicks the melon viciously out of sight and without any
particular preparation or fuss he flops down on his bed
following which Ellie goes to her bed and lies down too
Then a CLOSE VIEW of ELLIE appears and at the moment she
looks far removed from the spoiled pampered self-reliant
brat of Alexander Andrews Instead she is a helpless baby
clinging to Peters protective wing Shed be ever so
grateful right now for a little civility on his part for
a little tenderness and understanding and she glances
over at him hopefully PETER however stares up at the
stars dreamily and we then SEE ELLIE turning away from
him disappointed Still the minute Ellie turns her head
Peter looks at her out of the corner of his eye and its
a long and steady gaze Then suddenly he gets an idea and
rises He finds his topcoat and goes to her

PETER
Might get chilly later on
(he spreads it over
her)
Better use this

As he bends down to tuck her in their faces are SEEN in
CLOSE proximity Ellie tremulous and fearful has her

eyes peeled on him The situation is imminent with danger
anything is likely to happen at this moment and she is
frightened and expectantéshe knows how weak she would be
if he suddenly crushed her in his arms Peter avoids her
gaze He too is a bit shaky The temptation is there and
his resistance is waning He tucks her in and quickly turns
away Ellies eyes however never leave him Immediate
danger has vanished and it leaves her a little regretful

A CLOSE VIEW of PETER as he walks over to a rock and sits
down shows him nervously taking out a cigarette and
lighting it

PETER
Youve had a lot of men crazy about
you havent you

ELLIE doesnt respond She has the scrutinizing speculative
look of a girl who feels herself falling in love with
someone who is practically a stranger to her as a result
of which she is frightened Then a WIDER VIEW includes
both of them and we see that Peter too fights valiantly
against a mounting interest in this girl who epitomizes
everything he dislikes He creates the impression in the
following scene that in his analysis of her he is trying
to dissuade himself from something he is bound to regret
His attack on her consequently is overly vicious

PETER
I guess youve pretty much had
your own way with them Thats
your trouble mostly Youve always
had your own way Thats why youre
such a mess now

He pauses a second waiting for a protest but Ellie offers
none she is too much absorbed in her own confusing
emotions A CLOSE VIEW then shows PETER taking a long puff
on his cigarette and exhaling the smoke watching it vanish
before he speaks

PETER

(suddenly)
You know what generally happens to
people like you You get your values
all mixed up You attach all the
importance to the wrong things
Right now for instance theres
only one thought in your minddto
get back to king Westley

He waits for a reaction but a CLOSE VIEW shows ELLIE
absorbed and she remains silent Peters voice continues

PETERS VOICE

Comical part of it is it isnt
what you want at all In a couple
of weeks youll be looking for the
nearest exit

(now seen with her)
People like you spend all your
life on a merry-go-round I guess
thats what makes you so dizzy

(he rises and paces

a few moments)
Youre always chasing after
something At least you think you
are Truth is youre just running
away

(emphatically)
From yourself mostly Cause youre
miserable You hate yourself The
worlds full of people like you
Dont know what they want

ELLIE
Do you know

PETER
Sure

ELLIE
What

PETER
(flatly)
Nothing
(after a pause)
Nothing youd give two cents for

ELLIE
(seen CLOSE)

Try me

PETERS VOICE
I just want to be let alone thats
all Lifes swell if you dont try
too hard Most people want to get
a strangle-hold on it Theyre not
living Theyre just feverish

(now appearing with

her)
If they didnt get themselves all
balled up with a lot of manufactured
values theyd find what they want
Peace and calm When you get right
down to it whats all the shootin
for will you tell me After all
you can only eat three meals a
day only sleep in one bedéd

(looking up)
Right now that hay feels pretty
good to you doesnt it Sure it
does Cause you were tireddoand
its the only thing around

ELLIE
You sound like a hobo

PETER
I am I only work when I have to
Two years ago I got a notion and
went to China There was a war
going on Swell After a while it
got stale I went down to Tahiti
Just lay on the beach for six
months What could be sweeter

ELLIE
Doesnt sound very exciting

PETER seen CLOSE looks at her for a long time before
speaking

PETER

I guess not Id have given odds
it wouldnt mean anything to you

(he goes over and

flops down on his

own side of hay)
There were moments when I had hopes
When Idaw Im wasting timedYoure
destined to be a dope the rest of
your life

(contemptuously)
I pity you Goodnight

He turns over with a finality that precludes any further
discussion following which a CLOSE-UP of ELLIE reveals

that her eyes are wide open staring thoughtfully up at

the sky The scene fades out slowly
Part Seven A ROAD FADES IN It is day now and Peter and
Ellie are trundling along Ellie limps and wears an unhappy
expression on her face

ELLIE
What are you thinking about

PETER
By a strange coincidence I was
thinking of you

ELLIE
(pleased)
Really
PETER

Yeah I was just wondering what
makes dames like you so dizzy

ELLIE
Whatd you say were supposed to
be doing

PETER
Hitch-hiking

ELLIE
Well youve given me a very good
example of the hikingdo

(STRONGLY)
where does the hitching come in

PETER
(amused at her)
A little early yet No cars out
yet

She spies a rock and heads for it Then we see her seated
on the rock

ELLIE

If its just the same to you well
sit right here till they come

(Peter comes over

sets his bag down

and prepares to

wait)
Got a toothpick

PETER
No But Ive got a penknife
(he extracts one
from his pocket
which he snaps
open)

ELLIE
Haydéin my teeth

She points to her front teeth and Peter flicks the hay
out of her teeth

PETER
There it is Better swallow it
Were not going to have any
breakfast

ELLIE

Neednt rub it in
(Peter takes a carrot
out of his coat
pocket and starts
nibbling on it
Ellie looks up at
this)

Whatre you eating

PETER
Carrots

ELLIE
Raw

PETER

Uh-huh Want one

ELLIE

(emphatically)
No

(as Peter smacks

his lips with

satisfaction)
Its a wonder you couldnt get me
something I can eat

PETER

You dont think Im going around
panhandling for you

(he takes a bite)
Best thing in the world for
youocarrots Had a tough time
getting them If that farmer ever
caught medgoodnight

ELLIE
I hate the horrid stuff

While she speaks a car roars by at terrific speed Peter
and Ellie both jump up

PETER
I wish you wouldnt talk too much
We let a car get away
(Ellie goes back to
her rock
despondently)

ELLIE
What if nobody stops for us

PETER
Oh theyll stop all right Its
a matter of knowing how to hail
them

ELLIE
Youre an expert I suppose

PETER
Expert Going to write a book on
it Called the Hitch-Hikers Hail

ELLIE
Theres no end to your
accomplishments

PETER
You think its simple huh

ELLIE
(exaggeratedly)
Oh no

PETER
Well it is simple Its all in
the thumb see A lot of people do
ité

(WAVING)
like this
(he shakes his head
sadly)

But theyre all wrong Never get
anywhere

ELLIE
Tch Tch Im sorry for the poor
things

PETER

But the thumb always works
Different ways to do it though
Depends on how you feel For
instance number one is a short
jerky movemento

(he demonstrates)
That shows independence You dont
care if they stop or not Cause
you got some money in your pocket
see
ELLIE
Clever

PETER
Number two is a wider movementdéa
smile goes with that onedlike this
(he demonstrates)
That means you got a couple of
brand new stories about the farmers
daughter 12

ELLIE
You figured that all out yourself
huh

PETER

Oh thats nothing Now take number
three for instance Thats a pip
Its the pathetic one When youre
brokedéand hungrydand everything
looks black Its a long movement
like this6

(demonstrating)
éwith a follow through

ELLIE
Amazing

PETER
Hm Yeah but its no good if you
havent got a long face with it

In the distance a car is heard approaching and Ellie looks
up quickly

ELLIE
(excitedly)
Here comes a car

PETER
(alert)
Now watch me Im going to use
Number One Keep your eye on that
thumb baby and see what happens

Peter steps forward into the road and does his thumb
movement The car approaches but speeds right by spreading
a cloud of dust in Peters face leaving him staring at

the departing car nonplussed Thereupon ELLIE (SEEN CLOSE)
glances up at him a satirical expression on her face

ELLIE
(sarcastically)

Im still watching your thumb

Peter is still looking after the car
PETER
Something must have gone wrong I
guess Ill try number two

ELLIE
When you get up to a hundred wake
me up

Another car is heard coming and Peter steps forward
prepared to hail it Then this dissolves to a LONG VIEW of
the ROAD as a stream of cars of every description speeds
forward (TOWARD THE CAMERA) and vanishes The VIEW MOVING
IN TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD Peter is SEEN still in the

same spot He waves his arms jerks his thumb indulges in
all sorts of gyrations while Ellie remains slumped on her
rock completely worn out

Now Ellie watches Peter out of the corner of her eye her
face expressionless Peter continues his arm wavingdbut
slows down like a mechanical toy which has run out He
finally gets down to just thumbing his nose at the passing
vehicles and then thoroughly wearied he flops down on a
rock near Ellie

PETER
I guess maybe I wont write that
book after all

ELLIE
Yes But look at all the fun you
had
(as he glares at
her)
Mind if I try

PETER
(contemptuously)
You Dont make me laugh

ELLIE
Youre such a smart aleck Nobody
can do anything but you Ill show
you how to stop a cardand I wont
use my thumb

The scene widens as she rises and steps forward

PETER
Whatre you going to do

ELLIE
Mind your own business

She lifts her skirt to above her knees and pretends to be
fixing her garter Her very attractive leg is in full
display Almost instantly we hear the screaming and
grinding of quickly applied brakes and Peter looks up
astonished

The scene WIPING OFF we then get a CLOSER VIEW of Ellie
and Peter sitting in the back of an open Ford It is a
broken-down rickety affair of the 1920 vintage Ellie
grins victoriously up at Peter who stares ahead of him
glumly

ELLIE
You might give me a little credit

PETER
What for

ELLIE
I proved once and for all that the
limb is mightier than the thumb

PETER
Why didnt you take all your clothes
off You could have stopped forty
cars

ELLIE
We dont need forty cars

Peter glares at her and Ellies eyes twinkle mischievously
following which we get a wider VIEW which includes the
driver of the car Danker He is a man of about thirty a
heavy set loose chinned person at the moment he is singing
an aria from some opera He suddenly stops turning to

Ellie and Peter in the back seat

DANKER
So youve just been married huh
Well thats pretty good If I was
young thats just the way Id
spend my honeymoondohitch-hiking Y-
e-s s-i-r

And for no reason except that he cued himself into it he
bursts forth into song gustily

DANKER
(singing)
Hiking down the highway of love
on a honeymoon
Hitch-hiking downd
Down-down-down the highway Downd

Ellie and Peter in the back of the car react to the noise
Danker makes

PETER
Hey hey arent you afraid youll
burn out a tonsil
DANKER
Tonsil Me No Me burn a tonsil
(singing)
My tonsils wont burnd
As lifes corners I

PETER
(giving up)
All right let it go

DANKER
(completing his
last line)

» turn

The scene DISSOLVES TO the front of a LUNCH WAGON on a
deserted road and Dankers car drives into the scene and
stops Then we SEE Danker turning to Ellie and Peter

DANKER
How about a bite to eat

ELLIE
(quickly)
Why I think that would bed

PETER
(stopping her)
No thanks Were not hungry

DANKER
(sentimentally)
Oh I see young people in love
are never hungry

PETER
No

DANKER
(singing as he leaves
them)
Young people in love Are very
seldom hungry
People in love Are very seldom
hungry

When he is out of sight Peter glares at Ellie

PETER
What were you going to do Gold
dig him for a meal13

ELLIE
(defiantly)
Why not Im hungry
PETER
Eat a carrot

ELLIE
Never
(she starts out of
car)
Im going in and ask himd

PETER
(grabbing her arm)
If you do Ill break your neck

She looks up at his glowering face realizes he means it
and wilts under his dominant gaze

PETER
Lets get out and stretch our legs

Peter gets out followed by Ellie and they walk away from
the car Both are silent At the DOOR of the LUNCH WAGON
then Danker comes out and looks around furtively Ellie

and Peter as seen by him appear walking away following
which the VIEW moves over to the Ford and drops down to a
CLOSE-UP of Peters suitcase Now Danker looks about quickly
and starts toward his car He springs into the car steps

on the starter and is off

ELLIE and PETER hear the motor They wheel around and
their eyes widen in surprise

PETER
Hey

He flings his coat at Ellie and dashes after the Ford He
is then seen running after it when the car turns around a
bend in the road Peter continues the pursuit This scene
WIPING OFF the FORD now makes its appearance around the
bend and as it approaches Peter is SEEN at the wheel He
looks like hes just been through a fight And as Peter
rides in Ellie comes running toward him

ELLIE
(a note of great
relief in her voice)
Oh Peter What happened Are you
all right

PETER
Come ondget in

ELLIE
(noticing a gash in
his cheek)
Oh youve been hurt Theres a
cut ond
PETER
(impatiently)
Come on come on
(at this she runs
around to get in
the other side)

ELLIE
(as she runs)
What happened

PETER

(as we see them

CLOSEr)
Just a road thief Picks people up
and runs off with their stuff
What a racket

(by this time she

is in the car)

ELLIE
Whatd you give him for the car

PETER
A black eye
(thereupon the car
moves out of sight)

A CLOSE VIEW shows Peter and Ellie driving along in the
Ford Peter looks ahead uncommunicatively Ellie glances
up at him and it is plain that somethings on her mind

ELLIE
(a little self-
consciously)
Lookéuhéhow are theduhdcarrots
holding out Any left

Peter glances at her He knows what a concession this is
on her part and he smiles sympathetically

PETER
(tenderly)
You dont have to eat the carrots
(as she looks her

surprise)
Just passed a pond with some ducks
in it
ELLIE
(with a cry of joy)
Darling

She reaches up and kisses his cheek and Peter beams
happily

PETER
(looking worried)
Havent much gas left in this thing
Got to start promoting some
(throwing her his
coat)
Better take the things out of the
pocket of that coat Ought to be
good for ten gallons

The scene FADES OUT

Part Eight ANDREWS STUDY FADES IN affording a CLOSE VIEW
of King Westley He answers every description we have had
of him He is a stiff handsome stuffed-shirt gigolo He
sits in a chair leaning on a cane his gloves loosely in
his hand The VIEW then MOVES BACK to reveal ANDREWS who
from the opening of the scene is speaking as he paces
around the room

ANDREWS
I havent changed my mind Westley
I want you to understand that I
dont like you I never have I
never will Thats clear enough
isnt it

KING

Youve made that quite evidentdwith
all your threats of annulment

(confident)
Well it hasnt bothered me for a
minute Ellie and I got married
because we love each other And
shes proving it as far as Im
concerned theres going to be no
annulment

ANDREWS

(hard)
Youve got a good thing and youre
hanging on to it huh

(Andrews smiles in

a very superior

manner)
All right You win Ill just have
to get used to you I admit Im
licked But only because Im
worried Ive had detectives all
over the country searching for
her Ive seen thousands of
photographs Fortune tellers nuts
every crank in the country has
written me

(quietly)
Havent slept one night this week
If I dont find her Ill go crazy
WESTLEY
might have been able to help if it
werent for you Ive been watched
so closely I6

ANDREWS

(impatiently)
Yes I know Well you can help
now I issued a statement yesterday
that Ive withdrawn my objections
Begging her to come home I havent
heard from her Apparently she
doesnt trust me

WESTLEY
Why should she After allé

ANDREWS
(interrupting)
All right Thats why I sent for

you
(pointing to next
room)
Theres a room full of reporters
out there I want you to make a
statementothat youve had a talk
with medthat weve reached an
understandingdthat if Ellen comes
home I wont interfere with your
marriage Will you do that

WESTLEY
If you really mean it I will

ANDREWS
(strongly)
Of course I mean it I dont care
whom shes married tod
(softly)
é6as long as I can get her back
(he starts out)

As Andrews opens the door a number of reporters enter

ANDREWS
Come in boys This is myduhdthis
is King Westley
(Westley rises)
He has a statement to make

REPORTERS
Hello Westley How do you
do
(they group around
him)

The scene DISSOLVES TO the side of a lonely ROAD at night
First there is a CLOSE-UP of a newspaper headline which
reads

ANDREWS WITHDRAWS OBJECTION
Magnate and Aviator Reconciled
Everything all right Come home
darling says Westley

Then the VIEW DRAWS BACK revealing that the newspaper is
in the hands of Ellie who sits in the car alone gazing
at the headlines Then Peters voice is heard

PETERS VOICE
All right Brat

At the sound of his voice she is startled and she quickly
folds the paper and throws it out of sight She starts to
get out of the car

ELLIE
(as she scrambles
out of the car
just as Peter comes
up to her)
Any luck

PETER
Yeah He finally agreed to let us
have a room

ELLIE
What about money

PETER
Talked him out of it He thinks
were going to stay a week Ill
have to think of something before
morning

ELLIE
Thats swell

PETER
Im glad you think so If you ask
me its foolish I told you theres
no sense in our staying here
tonight We could make New York in
less than three hours

ELLIE
I couldnt arrive in New York at
three in the morning Everybodys
in bed

PETER
(after a pause)
Okay
(with a wave of his
hand)
Cottage Number Three

As they start toward it the scene CUTS TO the OWNERS
CABIN The owner of the auto camp and his wife are standing
at window looking out She is a hatchet-faced shrew He

is meek and docile

WIFE
There you godtrustin people again
How many times did I tell youd

OWNER
He looked like an upright young
feller to me Ma

WIFE
Yeah Theyre all upright till
they walk out on you

OWNER
Said he was gonna stay a week

WIFE
Mebbe

OWNER
Worst comes to the worst we got
his car for security

WIFE
(unconvinced)
I dont trust him

The scene CUTS TO the inside of a CABIN not unlike the
previous auto camp cabin in which Peter and Ellie spent a
night Peters opened suitcase is on a chair over which
he leans Ellie walks around puffing at a cigarette

PETER
(without looking up)
Well here we are on the last lap

Ellie crosses to the window and stares out moodily Peter
removes several things from his suitcase and lays them on
the bed There is a strained silence between them as both
are lost in their own thoughts A CLOSE VIEW of PETER as

he putters abstractedly with the contents of his bag creates
the impression that he empties it tonight rather ruefully
It somehow spells finis to their adventure

PETER
(strangely)
Tomorrow morning youll be in the
arms of your husband
ELLIE (SEEN CLOSE) turns away from the window and looks at
Peter She stares this way for a long moment before
speaking

ELLIE
(in a still small
voice)
Yes Youll have a great story
wont you

PETER
(dryly)
Yeah swell

Peter takes the rope out of his bag It is the one used
for the Walls of Jericho previously He lays it aside
and then remembering retrieves it For a moment he holds
it in his hand speculatively then turning proceeds to
tack it up The noise of the tacking attracts Ellies
attention and Ellie (again SEEN CLOSE) turns and looks
toward Peter

ELLIE
Is that the Walls of Jericho going
up

PETERS VOICE

Yep The Walls of Jericho
(at which she turns
back to the window)

PETER (also SEEN CLOSE) stretches the rope across the room
and tacks the other side

PETER
(then reaching for
blanket)
We certainly outsmarted your father
(he throws the
blanket over the
rope)
I guess you ought to be happy

There is no response from her a CLOSE VIEW revealing that
she quite obviously isnt happy They are now separated by
the blanket and Peter gets her pajamas from his suitcase

and throws them over the blanket

ELLIE
Thank you
(there is silence
while Peter starts
undressing suddenly)
Am I going to see you in New York

PETER
(laconically)
Nope

ELLIE
Why not

PETER glances up at the Walls of Jericho and after a
speculative pause speaks quietly

PETER
I dont make it a policy to run
around with married women

A CLOSE-UP of Ellie disclosing only her neck and shoulders
shows her slipping out of her clothes She pausesdéthen
looks up

ELLIE
No harm in your coming to see us

PETERS VOICE
Not interested
(at this Ellies
face falls this
is a definite rebuff

ELLIE
(weakly)
Wont I ever see you again

PETER (SEEN CLOSE) is now getting into his pajamas

PETER

What do you want to see me for
Ive served my purpose I brought
you back to King Westley didnt
I

(his mouth screws

up bitterly)
Thats what you wanted wasnt it

ELLIE is already in bed staring up at the ceiling

ELLIE
Peter have you ever been in love

PETER crawls into bed

PETER

I probably did the world a great
favor at that Got two pinheads
out of circulation

(he reaches over

and lights a

cigarette)
Cupid thinks hes doing something
when he brings two lovers together
What goods that Im bringing two
pains-in-the-neck together I think
Ill start an institutiondhang out
a shingle

The VIEW now WIDENS to include both sides of the blanket
Ellie doesnt hear a word of Peters attack She is too
intent on her own thoughts

ELLIE
Havent you ever wanted to fall in
love

PETER
Me

ELLIE

Yes Havent you thought about it
at all Seems to me you could make
some girl wonderfully happy

PETER

(disdainfully)
Maybe

(after a pause)
Sureosure Ive thought about it
Who hasnt If I ever met the right
sort of a girl Ido

(interrupting himself)
Yeah but where you going to find
herdésomebody thats realdsomebody
thats alive They dont come that
way any more

ELLIES disappointment is apparent

PETER

(seen CLOSE)
Ive even been sucker enough to
make plans

(a long puff on his

cigarette)
I saw an island in the Pacific
once Never been able to forget
it Thats where Id like to take
her But shed have to be the sort
of a girl thatd jump in the surf
with me on moonlight nightsdoand
love it as much as I did

(he loses himself

in his romantic

contemplations)
You know those nights when you
and the moon and the water all
become onedwhen something comes
over youdand you feel that youre
part of something big and marvelous

(sighing)
Those are the only places to live
Where the stars are so close over
your head that you feel you could
reach right up and stir them around

A CLOSE-UP of ELLIE at this point shows that she is affected
by his stirring description of a heavendfrom which she is
excluded as she listens to him continuing

PETERS VOICE
Certainly Ive been thinking about
it Boy if I could ever finda
girl whos hungry for those things6

PETER (again SEEN CLOSE) has disposed of his cigarette and
now stares dreamily heavenward

PETER
Im going to Swim in the surf with
herdéIm going to reach up and grab
stars for herdIm going to laugh
with herdand cry with her Im
going to kiss her wet lipsdéandé

Suddenly stopping he turns his head slowly sensing Ellies
nearness and the VIEW drawing back to include Ellie
SHOWS her standing at his bedside looking down at him
yearningly

Then we SEE them CLOSE together Peters face is immobile
Ellie drops to her knees

ELLIE
(fervently)
Take me with you Peter Take me
to your island I want to do all
those things you talked about

Peter stares at her lovely face His heart cries out with
an impulse to crush her in his arms

PETER
(after a long pause
hoarsely)
Better go back to your bed

ELLIE
(simply)
I love you

PETER
(arguing with himself)
Youre forgetting youre married

ELLIE
(tensely)
I dont care I love you Nothing
else matters We can run away
Everythingll take care of itself
(begging)
Please Peter You cant go out of
my life now I couldnt live without
you
(in a choked voice)
Oh Peterd

Sobbing she lays her head on his breast and throws her
arms around him All is quiet for a moment as Ellies head
rests on his breast while Peter struggles with an
overwhelming urge to pour out his heart to her

PETER
(scarcely audible)
Better go back to your bed

There is a lengthy pause neither of them stirs Then Ellie
slowly raises her tear-stained face and gets to her feet

ELLIE
(whispering)
Im sorry

She turns and disappears behind the blanket Peter remains
motionless Then a CLOSE VIEW shows Ellie as she gets

into bed sobbing quietly She hides her face in the pillow
to suppress her sobs It is the first time in her life

that she has been so deeply hurt A CLOSE VIEW next shows
Peter reaching over for a cigarette which he lights All
his movements are thoughtful meditative He leans back

and stares at the ceiling until we see only the cigarette
in his mouth as it emits slowly rising puffs of smoke

This dissolving the cigarette is seen to be burnt three
quarters down a long frail ash hanging perilously on
Peter is then seen as he removes the cigarette from his
mouth and crushes it in a tray He leans back on the pillow
and for a moment he is quiet Then glancing over in Ellies
direction he calls to her

PETER
(softly calling)
Hey Bratdé
(a pause)
Did you mean that Would you really
go
(he waits fora
response but none
comes He tries
again)
Hey Brato

He listensdall is QUIET He slips his covers off and crosses
to the blanket and peers over it She is asleep Her tear-
stained face rests on the pillow her arm extends over her
head It is a childlike posture
PETER is watching her tenderly He speculates whether to
awaken her and decides against it He starts away Peter
tiptoes around the room for a few moments deep in thought
Then as an idea which he has been turning over in his mind
begins to take form he hastily begins dressing

The scene DISSOLVING Peter is seen completely clothed and
starting for the door when he thinks of something He turns
back grabs his suitcase stops to throw a kiss to Ellie
and goes out into the night Thereupon the scene WIPES

OFF disclosing a Gas Station along the road at night

Here Peter is talking to a station attendant

PETER
All Im asking is enough gas to
get me to New York The bags worth
twenty-five dollars

MAN
(hesitatingly)
Yeah but I got a bag My wife
gave me one for Christmas

PETER

(high-pressuring

him)
Listen manoI1ll tell you what
Ill do When I come back in the
morning Ill buy it back from you
and give you ten dollars profit
What do you say

MAN
(looking at Peters
hat)
aint got a haté

PETER
What

MAN
I aint got a hat

PETER
(promptly putting
it on his head)
Well you got one now 6Come on
fill er up

While he is still talking the scene DISSOLVES TO a VIEW of
Peter driving furiously a broad happy grin on his face
following which several scenes wipe off in succession
(denoting the passage of time) Oéscenes of Peter driving at
high speed causing several cows to amble out of the way
of the CAR driving into the Holland Tunnel and of the
BACK ROOM of a SPEAKEASY where Peter stands in front of a
small desk upon which there is a typewriter Near him is a
swarthy Italian

PETER
Fine Thats fine Tony Now get
me a drink and make sure nobody
disturbs me for half an hour

ITALIAN
(going out)
Sure Sure Pete

As Peter plants himself in front of the machine the scene
dissolves to a CLOSE-UP of the typewriter carriage upon
which are typed the words

Oand thats the full and exclusive story of Ellen Andrews
adventures on the road As soon as her marriage to King
Westley is annulled she and Peter Warne famous
newspapermanoand undoubtedly the most promising young
novelist of the present eraéwill be married

The VIEW DRAWING BACK Peter re-reads the last sentence
smiles contentedly and as he yanks out the sheet the
scene WIPES OFF disclosing the outside of GORDONS OFFICE
the sign on the door reading OfficedMr Gordon Gordons
secretary is at her desk as Peter breezes in

PETER
(rumpling her hair)
Hello Agnes

AGNES

on sight

PETER
(entering)
I havent been shot at for days

In GORDONS OFFICE Gordon is at his desk He looks up
when Peter enters

GORDON
(rising to his full
height menacingly)

Peter reaches his side and grabs him by the arms

out)

PETER

While Peter has been speaking Gordon stares into space
thoughtfully

GORDON

What a story

(picturing it)
On her way to join her husband
Ellen Andrews falls in love withd

(alertdograbbing

paper out of Peters

hand)
Lemme see that a minute

He moves to his desk excitedly and Peter a gleam of hope
in his eyes joins him following which the scene CUTS TO
the SHACK of the camp owner and wife in the early morning
The owner is suddenly startled out of his sleep by the
voice of his wife calling zeke zeke He looks up
just as she rushes into the room

WIFE
I told you I told you you couldnt
trust him Hes gone

OWNER

WIFE

car with him too We wouldnt
have known a thing about it until
morning if I hadnt took that
magnesia

(pulling at him)
Come on get up dont lay there
Lets do something about it

Thereupon the scene CUTS TO the AUTO CAMP CABIN affording
a CLOSE VIEW of ELLIE tossing restlessly in her sleep
Suddenly there is a loud banging on the door and Ellie

There is a CLOSE VIEW of ELLIE as the wifes voice continues
uninterruptedly

WIFES VOICE

idea of Peters leaving her like this She scarcely hears

determined to wait until Ellie gets dressed and out

ELLIE

The scene thereupon CUTS TO the EXTERIOR of the AUTO CABIN
as Ellie emerges the Wife standing in the doorway In the
foreground several people are scattered around the
courtyard One woman washes stockings under a pump A man
is changing the tire on his car Ellie comes down the steps
and crosses the courtyard

WIFE
(shouting to her)
And listen next time better keep
away from here I run a respectable
place

Ellie does not turn but walks straight forward trying to
maintain her poise The people in the courtyard turn to
stare at her and one of them snickers

The scene DISSOLVES TO GORDONS OFFICE as Peter is pocketing
the money Gordon is fondling the story

PETER
Thanks Pal You saved my life

GORDON

(waving the story)
Okay pete

(he drops the story

on the desk and

escorts peter out

his arm around his

shoulder)

in the business

They reach the door which peter opens Then they appear
at the DOORWAY Through the open door the secretary stares
dumbfounded at their friendliness

GORDON
Slong kid And good luck

Outside GORDONS OFFICE peter kisses the secretary as he
passes through

PETER

(he goes out)
Gordon is immediately electrified
into action

GORDON

impatiently)

A CLOSE VIEW of GORDON as he listens shows his eyes
widening with amazement

GORDON

This CUTS TO a TELEPHONE BOOTH where a reporter is seen
speaking excitedly

REPORTER

from an auto camp to come and get
her Hes getting a police escort
Westleys going along too Shes
been traveling by bus The moment
she read that her father and Westley

dumbly as he speaks

into the phone)

(he hangs upoand

turns to Agnes)
Call up the police department
Tell em to find Peter Warne Send

He picks up Peters story and flings it viciously into the
wastebasket

AGNES
(starting out)
Yessir
(two re-write men
come in passing
Agnes)

MEN

GORDON
(wheeling around)

Yeah Shove everything off the

man withdrew his objections she
gave herself up Spread it all

Love Triumphant Step on it
MEN
(leaving)
Yessir

Gordon goes to his desk mumbling to himself His eye lights
on the waste basket containing Peters story and he is
about to kick it when he stops He stares at it
thoughtfully reaches down lifts it outdruns through it
hastilyoand then stares into space deep in thought

The scene DISSOLVES TO an open ROAD in the morning as
Peter flies over it in his Ford He beams happily He passes
a gasoline truck and waves cheerily to the driver This
DISSOLVES TO a CLOSE-UP of an AUTO SIREN accompanied by a
prolonged wail then to a ROAD that morning as four
motorcycles two abreast speed forward followed by a
luxurious limousine which in turn is trailed by a car
filled with reporters Next in the LIMOUSINE Andrews is
seen in the back seat He is accompanied by King
WestleyoHendersonoLovington and a police inspector

HENDERSON
I knew she was safe

LOVINGTON

(sighing)
Certainly gave us a run for our
money

(but Andrews is too

overwhelmed with

joy to listen to

any of this)

ANDREWS

(anxiously)
Cant you get them to go any faster

(at this the

Inspector leans

over to talk to

chauffeur)
This dissolves to a deserted ROAD
Peter at the wheel of his car His
high spirits find expression in
his efforts to sing

PETER
(singing)
I found a million dollar baby6

He is interrupted by the song of a meadowlark whistling
its strange melody Peter listens to it a second time
then answers its call by imitating it The meadowlark
whistles again and peter is highly amused

PETER
(waving his handdto
the meadowlark)
Okay pal Be seein you

Just then the sound of sirens is heard in the distance
Peter glances back and as the sirens come nearer he pulls
over to the side of the road There follows a FULL VIEW of
the ROAD with peter in the foreground at the side as the
police cavalcade whizzes by accompanied by the shrieking
sirens Thereupon PETER (SEEN CLOSE) gets an idea

PETER
(to his Ford)
Come on Dobbin old boy We got a
police escort

He applies the gas and shoots out of sight following which
a FULL VIEW of the road shows Peters car trying to catch
up with the parade It outdistances him however and we
SEE PETER in the Ford pressing his body forward to help

the car make time His foot pushes the accelerator down to
the floor But the police cars are now out of sight and
Peter gives up

PETER
(seen CLOSE to the
carowith exaggerated
dramatics)
Dobbin me lad You failed muh
Im afraid youre gittin old

Thereupon the scene DISSOLVES TO a small town ROAD where

at the door of a Sheriffs office a policeman is standing

on guard The reporters hang around in front of him Several
yokels look on The limousine and motor cycles are at the
curb And now in a CLOSER VIEW at the DOOR the policeman
on guard steps aside as the door opens and Ellie her
father and King Westley emerge King has his arm around
her The moment they appear in the doorway cameras click
and several reporters surround them

REPORTERS
Will you make a statement Miss
Andrews Was it an exciting
experience How did you travel

ANDREWS
(brushing them aside)
Later boys later See her at
home

They cross the sidewalkéoto the waiting limousine as cameras
click

The scene DISSOLVES TO a ROAD with Peter still driving

He is however as before in excellent form and is singing
lustily Suddenly however his eyes widen and he pulls on
his brake the car screeches and moanséand comes to a stop
PETER
Take it easy Dobbin Remember
your blood pressure

We find Peter directly in front of a slow moving freight
train Several hoboes stick their heads out of a car and
Peter waves to them The hoboes look puzzled for a minute
and then wave back The VIEW then swings over to an opening
between the cars affording a FLASH of the POLICE PARADE on
the other side apparently on its way back

PETER amuses himself by talking to an old flagman

PETER
Better get that toy train out of
here Im in a hurry

The Flagman grins at him in reply By this time the last
car is in sight and Peter gets all set to move He stops
however to wave to a couple of brakemen on the rear
platform

In the meantime the motorcycles have started forward and
the sirens begin their low moaning wail Peter attracted
turns and over Peters shoulder we see the parade starting
As the limousine passes we get a glimpse of the inside
Ellie lies back on King Westleys shoulder He has his arm
around her as they pass out of sight Thereupon a CLOSE
VIEW of PETER shows him reacting to what he saw He turns
his head quickly to stare at the disappearing car a look
of astonishment and bewilderment in his eyes Slowly he
turns his head forward staring ahead of him blankly he
cant quite make it out Then gradually the significance
of it all strikes himoand his mouth curls up bitterly

The scene WIPING OFF a series of NEWSPAPER HEADLINES come
into VIEW

ELLEN ANDREWS RETURNS HOME

This DISSOLVES TO the anteroom of a NEWSPAPER OFFICE The
place is alive with activity and copies of newspapers are
lying around bearing headlines relating to the Andrews

story Peter a bewildered stunned expression on his face
enters and crosses funereally toward Gordons office
Several people standing around look up

PEOPLE

He leaves Gordon watching him sympathetically and the
scene FADES OUT

Part Nine The LAWN of the ANDREWS ESTATE FADES IN It is
morning and at the moment the place is a beehive of
activity Dozens of butlers and maids hustle around setting
tables Floral decorations are being hung by men on ladders
In the background on a platform a twenty-piece orchestra

is getting ready accompanied by the scraping of chairs
adjusting of music stands unpacking of instruments

The scene CUTS TO ANDREWS STUDY King Westley is seated
and Andrews walks around him They are both dressed in
striped trousers frock coat etc

ANDREWS
Well here we are its all set
Youre finally going to be married

the window)

the largest in the world

KING

ANDREWS
Someday perhaps you might even
take charge

A CLOSE VIEW of ANDREWS shows him looking around his study
despairingly

ANDREWS
(murmuring)
The thought of it makes me shudder

KINGS VOICE
(confidently)
You might be surprised

ANDREWS
I hope so However thatll take
care of itself
(taking a new tack)
Theres another responsibility

really concerned about

KINGS VOICE

ANDREWS

again lightly)
Ellie Oh shes no responsibility

ANDREWS

A CLOSE VIEW of KING shows him looking up surprised
Andrews voice continues

ANDREWS VOICE

hand)

handorising)

ANDREWS
(dismissing him)
Fine Ill see you at the reception
He withdraws his hand which he looks at disgustedlyéthe
result of a jellyfish handshake

KING

Oh by the way Mr Andrews I
thought of a great stunt for the
reception

(as Andrews looks

at him quizzically)
Im going to land on the lawn in
an autogyro14 What do you think
of that

A CLOSE VIEW of ANDREWS shows him staring off at King in
complete disgust

ANDREWS
You thought that up all by yourself
huh
KING
(unabashed)

Why itll make all the front pages
A spectacular thing like thaté

ANDREWS
(hard)
Personally I think its stupid
(humoring a child)
But go ahead Have a good time As
long as Ellie doesnt object

KING

Oh no Shell be crazy about it
Well see you later Im going out
on the lawn and arrange for landing
space

(holding out his

hand)
Goodbye

(but Andrews turns

his back on him)

ANDREWS
Weve done that already

KING
(smiling)
Yes of course

He turns and leaves Andrews watching him go shaking his
head sadly

ANDREWS
Autogyro I hope he breaks his
leg
Andrews starts out and the scene CUTS TO the HALLWAY as
Andrews enters from the study A maid coming down the
stairs he calls to her

ANDREWS

MARY
(hesitantly)

MARY
Oh no sir No different thand

ANDREWS
Yes I know Still in the dumps

MARY

Yes sir If youll excuse me

(she leaves)
Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully
and then starts up the stairs
following which the scene dissolves
to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front
of Ellies door Andrews enters
and knocks several times Receiving
no response he gingerly opens the
door

Next Andrews enters ELLIES BEDROOM and looks around The
VIEW SWINGS AROUND THE ROOM following HIS GAZE It focuses
on Ellie who reclines on a sofa in her bridal outfit

her head resting on the back She stares moodily unhappily
up at the ceiling The VIEW then expanding to include BOTH
FATHER AND DAUGHTER Andrews is seen staring at her a moment
sympathetically He senses something is wrong

ANDREWS
(after a pause)
Ellied

ELLIE
(jumping up with a
start)
Oh hello Dad
ANDREWS
(a CLOSE VIEW as he
goes over to her)
I knocked several times

ELLIE
Sorry Must have been day-dreaming
(to hide her
confusion she
reaches for a
cigarette)

ANDREWS
(with forced
lightness)
Well everythings set Creating
quite a furor too Great stunt
Kings going to pull

ELLIE

(in a faraway voice)
Stunt

ANDREWS
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro

ELLIE
Oh yes I heard

ANDREWS
(noting her
listlessness)
Yes Personally I think its silly
too

As he continues talking the VIEW MOVES WITH ELLIE who
wanders over to a WINDOW OVERLOOKING THE LAWN and stares
out lost in thought

ANDREWS VOICE

(he goes over the

Ellie)
You look lovely Are you pleased
with the gown

(as Ellie does not

seem to hear him

he becomes worried)
Ellie

ELLIE
(turning and looking
at him blankly)
Huh

Ohdothe gownd
(distantly)
Yes its beautiful
ANDREWS
(tenderly)
Whats the matter Ellie Whats

ELLIE

(she walks over to
table and crushes
her cigarette)

ANDREWS

Youve been acting so strangely
since you returned IméIm worried
I havent bothered to ask you any
questionsdoI16

(waving his hand

toward the lawn)
Isnt all this what you wanted

(receiving no answer

from Ellie)
You havent changed your mind about

ELLIE
(too quickly)
Oh no
ANDREWS

If you have it isnt too late
You know how I feel about him But
I want to make you happy You gave
me such a scaredléwhen I couldnt
find you

(smiling

feeblydémeaning his

heart)
You know the old pump isnt what
it used to be

ELLIE
(her hand on his
arm)
Sorry Dad I wouldnt hurt you
for the world You know that

She moves away from him and sits on the sofa and Andrews
watches her a moment and crosses over to her He sits beside
her placing an arm affectionately around her shoulder

ANDREWS
(tenderly)
Ellieéwhat is it Arent you happy
child

At this point she finally breaks and impulsively buries
her face on his breast

ANDREWS

(after a pause

hoarsely)
I thought so I knew there was
something on your mind

(there are audible

sobs from Ellie)
Theredthere

They remain thus quietly for some time Finally Andrews
breaks the silence

ANDREWS
What is it darling
(receiving no answer)
You havent fallen in love with
somebody else have you

As this brings an audible sob from Ellie Andrews lifts up
her chin

ANDREWS
(looking into her
eyes)

Have you

(Ellie turns her
head away a little
ashamed of her
tears)

Ellie now rises and walks miserably away from him dabbing
her eyes Andrews watching her realizes he has hit upon
the truth He walks over to her

ANDREWS

I havent seen you cry since you

were a baby This must be serious
(Ellie is silent)

Whered you meet him

ELLIE
On the road

ANDREWS
(trying to cheer
her)
Now dont tell me you fell in
love with a bus driver

ELLIE
(smiling)
No

ANDREWS
Who is he
ELLIE
I dont know very much about him
(in a whisper)
Except that I love him

ANDREWS
(the great executive)
Well if its as serious as all
thatéwell move heaven and earth
tod

ELLIE
(quickly)
Itll do no good
(wryly)
He despises me

ANDREWS
Oh come nowd

ELLIE
He despises everything I stand
for He thinks Im spoiled and
pampered and selfish and
thoroughly insincere

ANDREWS
Ridiculous

ELLIE
He doesnt think so much of you
either

ANDREWS
(his eyes widening)
Well

ELLIE
He blames you for everything thats
wrong about me Thinks you raised
me stupidly

ANDREWS
(smiling)
Fine man to fall in love with

ELLIE
(whispering)
Hes marvelous

ANDREWS
Well what are we going to do about
it Where is he

ELLIE
(sadly)
I dont know

ANDREWS
Id like to have a talk with him

ELLIE
Its no use Dad I practically
threw myself at him
(she shrugs futilely)

ANDREWS
Well under the circumstances
dont you think we ought to call
this thing off

ELLIE
No Ill go through with it

ANDREWS
But thats silly child Seeing
how you feel whyd

ELLIE

It doesnt matter
(tired)

I dont want to stir up any more
trouble Ive been doing it all my
life Ive been such a burden to
youomade your life so miserabledand
mine too Im tired Dad Tired
of running around in circles Hes
right thats what Ive been doing
ever since I can remember

A CLOSE-UP of ANDREWS shows him watching Ellie as her
voice continues

ELLIES VOICE
Ive got to settle down It really
doesnt matter howdor wheredor
with whom

ANDREWS
(seriouslydimpressed)
Youve changed Ellie

ELLIE

(seen with Andrews

sighing)
Yes I guess I have

(sincerely)
I dont want to hurt anybody any
more I want to get away from all
this front page publicity It
suddenly strikes me as being cheap
and loathsome I cant walk out on
King now Itll make us all look
so ridiculous
(she shrugs
resignedly)
Besides what difference does it
make
(inaudibly)
Ill never see Peter again

ANDREWS
Is that his name

ELLIE
Yes Peter Warne

She starts to walk away when she is attracted by her
fathers surprise at the mention of the name

ANDREWS
Peter Warne
(his hand has
instinctively gone
to his inside pocket)

ELLIE
(noticing this)
Why Do you know him
(but Andrews
withdraws his hand
Apparently he has
changed his mind)

ANDREWS
(evasively)
Oh noéno
ELLIE

(suddenly anxious)
You havent heard from him have

you Dad
ANDREWS
(obviously guilty)
Why no Dont be silly
ELLIE

Oh please Dado

She has reached into his pocket and has extracted a letter
which she hurriedly opens and reads following which we
SEE a LETTER in Peters handwriting It is addressed to
Alexander Andrews 11 Wall Street It reads

Dear Sir

I should like to have a talk with you about a financial
matter in connection with your daughter
Peter Warne

Ellie is then SEEN READING and RE-READING the note Her
face clouds and then slowly changes to an expression of
complete disillusionment

ELLIE
(her voice strident)
Looks like that was his only
interest in me The reward

ANDREWS
(taking the note
from her)
Im sorry you read it

ELLIE
Are you going to see him

ANDREWS
I suppose so

ELLIE
(hard)
Certainly Pay him off Hes
entitled to it He did an excellent
job Kept me thoroughly entertained
Its worth every penny he gets

She paces agitatedly Andrews watching her silently He
knows what an awful blow to her pride this must be Mary
now enters with a cocktail tray which she sets on the table

ELLIE
Thanks Mary Thats just what I
need
(she pours herself
a cocktail)

MARY
Mr King Westley is on his way up

ELLIE
FineoéFine Have him come in

ANDREWS

(mumbling)
Ill be going

(he goes out behind

Mary)
Ellie swallows her drink and starts
pouring herself another as King
enters

ELLIE
(upon seeing him)
Well if it isnt the groom himself
Youre just in time King
A CLOSE VIEW of the Two shows King taking her in his arms

KING

How are you Ellie
(he gives her a
kiss which she
accepts
perfunctorilydbut
he insists upon
being ardent)

Are you happy

ELLIE

(releasing herself)
Happy Why shouldnt I be happy
Im getting the handsomest man in
captivity

(handing him a drink)
Here you are King Lets drink

(she holds her glass

out)

(She drains the

glass pouring

another as she

continues)
We finally made it didnt we

KING

ELLIE

life to be full of excitement

Never a dull moment Well get on
a merry-go-round and never get

KING

ELLIE

groom lands on the lawn with a
plane Its a perfect beginning

It sets just the right tempo
(handing him a drink)
Come on King Youre lagging
(they both drink

In ANDREWS STUDY Andrews walks around the room
perceptibly affected by his visit with Ellie He keeps
turning Peters letter over in his hand apparently debating
in his mind what to do with it He finally gets an ideadand
determinedly crosses to the phone Then the scene CUTS TO

a HOTEL ROOM First there is a CLOSE-UP of a NEWSPAPEROa
tabloid bearing a heading which reads LOVE TRIUMPHANT

Interrupted Romance of Ellen Andrews and King Westley
Resumed as Father Yields Wedding Reception to be Held on
Andrews Lawn

Below this is a page of pictures and the VIEW turns to
each photograph The first picture is of Ellie and King on
a beach The title over the picture reads Where they
met The second picture shows them in the cockpit of a
plane the heading reading Where they romanced The
next picture is of a small frame house with a shingle on
it reading Justice of the Peace Over the photograph is
a caption Where they were married The next picture is
of the Andrews Yacht and the title reads Where she was
taken Finally the VIEW moves down to the bottom of the
page to a picture of Ellie and King with her father between
them in front of Sheriffs office Caption reads Where
love triumphed Over these pictures the phone bell has
been ringing

And now PETER is seen staring expressionless at the
newspaper Suddenly he becomes conscious of the phone
ringing he looks upéthen goes to it

PETER
(into the phone)
Hello Yes Who
Oh Why cant I see you at

your office

The scene CUTS TO ANDREWS STUDY affording a CLOSE VIEW
of ANDREWS at the phone

ANDREWS

perhaps youd like to get this
thing settled

This CUTS TO the HOTEL ROOM where PETER is at the phone

PETER

ANDREWS
(seen in his office)
You neednt see anybody You can
come directly to my study Id

PETER
(at his phone)
Nodno What the deuce do I want
tod

His eyes fall on something and there follows a CLOSE VIEW
of a tabloid newspaper featuring the heading Love
Triumphant and containing the pictures of Ellie and King
The VIEW then moves down to feature headline reading Groom
to Land on Brides Lawn

King Westley plans to drop in an autogyro on the lawn of
Andrews estate

Peters mouth screws up disdainfully

PETER

(into the phone)
Yeah wait a minute Maybe I will
come over Id like to get a load
of that three-ring circus youre
pulling I want to see what love
looks like when its triumphant I
havent had a good laugh in a week

(he is still at the

phone as the scene

dissolves)
Then the LAWN of the ANDREWS ESTATE
dissolves in It is now filled
with guests who wander around
chattering gaily The orchestra
plays A captain of waiters in the
foreground instructs his men

CAPTAIN
I want everything to be just so
When the ceremony starts you stand
on the sidedéstill No moving
around6éno talking comprenez

The VIEW CUTS TO a ROADWAY leading to the estate and Peter
is seen driving up in his Ford and squeezing in between

two Rolls-Royces The uniformed chauffeurs glare at him
But Peter springs nonchalantly out of his car

PETER
(blithely as he
passes them)
Keep your eye on my car when youre
backing up you guys

And as he goes the chauffeurs look at each other
surprised The scene DISSOLVES TO ANDREWS STUDY where a
butler stands in front of Andrews who is seated at his
desk

ANDREWS
Show him in

The Butler leaving a CLOSE VIEW shows ANDREWS reaching
over and snapping on a dictograph concealed somewhere on
his desk The OFFICE coming into VIEW again we SEE Andrews
rising and awaiting Peters entrance After a moment Peter
comes in removes his soft felt hat and tucks it under

his arm

ANDREWS
Mr Warne

PETER
Yeah

ANDREWS

Come in Sit down

Peter advances into the room looking around curiously
His air is frigid contemptuous as Andrews studies him
and he makes no move to sit Andrews waves to a chair and
sits down himself Peter flops into the nearest chair

ANDREWS
(seen CLOSE with
Peter after a
pause)
I was surprised to get your note
My daughter hadnt told me anything
about you About your helping her

PETER
Thats typical of your daughter
Takes those things for granted
(too restless to
sit he jumps up)
Why does she think I lugged her
all the way from Miamio
(vehemently)
for the love of it

ANDREWS
Please understand me When I say
she didnt tell me anything about
it I mean not until a little while
ago She thinks youre entitled to
anything you can get

PETER
(bitterly)
Oh she does huh Isnt that sweet
of her You dont I suppose
ANDREWS
(shrugging)
dont know Id have to see on
what you base your claim I presume
you feel youre justified ind

PETER
(seen CLOSE now)
If I didnt I wouldnt be here
(he reaches into
his pocket)
Ive got it all itemized
(And he throws the
paper on Andrews
desk)

ANDREWS picks up the paper and glances at it After a
moment he looks at Peter studying him interestedly then
he returns to the paper and reads its contents

Cash outlay

TOPCOAT

Suitcase

HAT

3 shirts

TOTAL

3960

Andrews looks up from the paper This is a twist he hadnt
anticipated and he doesnt quite know how to handle it

PETER
(now seen closer
with Andrews)
I sold some drawers and socks
too Im throwing those in

ANDREWS
And this is what you wantdothirty-
nine dollars and sixty cents

PETER
Why not Im not charging you for
the time I wasted

ANDREWS
Yes I knowdbuto

PETER
Whats the matter Isnt it cheap
enough A trip like that would
cost you a thousand dollars

ANDREWS
Let me get this straight You want
this thirty-nine sixty in addition
to the ten thousand dollars

PETER
What ten thousand

ANDREWS
The reward
PETER
(sharply)

Who said anything about a reward

ANDREWS
(smiling)
Im afraid Im a little confused
You see I assumed you were coming
here ford

PETER
(impatiently)
All I want is thirty-nine sixty
If youll give me a check Ill get
out of this place It gives me the
jitters

ANDREWS
Youre a peculiar chap

PETER
(irritably)
Well go into that some other time

ANDREWS
The average man would go after the
reward All you seem tod

PETER

Listen did anybody ever make a
sucker out of you This is a matter
of principle Something you probably
wouldnt understand

(he burns at the

thought)
When somebody takes me for a buggy
ride I dont like the idea of having
to pay for the privilege

ANDREWS
You were taken for a buggy ride

PETER
Yeahowith all the trimmings Now
how about the check Do I get it

A CLOSE-UP indicates that ANDREWS has been
throughout the scene He is now completely

ANDREWS
(smiling)

Certainly

(he opens a checkbook
and writes it out)

While Andrews writes Peter wanders around
attitude of bitter contempt Andrews rises

him

ANDREWS

Here you are

check)

the room
and goes

Do you mind if I ask you something

(Peter just looks
at him without
responding)

folding the check)

A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows Andrews smiling Here is a

man

PETER

If you had half the brains youre
supposed to have youd have done

ANDREWS
Do you love her

PETER

(going for his hat

as he replies)
A normal human being couldnt live
under the same roof with her
without going nuts

(going to the door)
Shes my idea of nothing

ANDREWS
I asked you a question Do you
love her

PETER
(snapping it out)
Yes
(as Andrews smiles)
But dont hold that against me
Im a little screwy myself

He snaps the door open and goes out following which ANDREWS
is seen watching the door his eyes twinkling and the

scene CUTS TO the DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY as Peter comes through
moving on to the front door But just as he reaches it
Ellie enters accompanied by half a dozen men and holding

a cocktail in her hand They see each other almost
simultaneously and both stop glaring

PETER
(looking her over
contemptuously)
Perfect Now you look natural

At this Ellie leaves her group and comes toward Peter and
a CLOSE VIEW shows them together glaring at each other

ELLIE
(icily)
I hope you got your money

PETER
You bet I did

ELLIE
Congratulations

PETER
Same to you

ELLIE
Why dont you stay and watch the
fun Youll enjoy it immensely

PETER
I would But Ive got a weak
stomach

He wheels around and goes through the door Ellie looking
after him her eyes blazing The drone of a plane motor
outside is heard and several people rush down the stairs
all excited

GUESTS
Here comes King Hes just coming
down Hurry up everybody Come
on Ellie

Immediately there is a general excitement as guests hurry
through the hallway on the way to the lawn But Ellen does
not movedshe remains staring blankly at the door through
which Peter went until Andrews enters from his study

ANDREWS
I just had a long talk with him

ELLEN
(her voice breaking)
Im not interested

ANDREWS
Now wait a minute Elliedé

ELLIE
(sharply)
I dont want to hear anything about
him

She walks away from him and Andrews frustrated looks at
her helplessly Thereupon the scene dissolves to a FULL
VIEW of the LAWN The orchestra is playing Mendelssohns
Wedding March The lawn is crowded with guests In the
background we see the autogyro idling A CLOSER VIEW shows
a small platform serving as an altar Over it there is an
arbor of roses Back of the altar stands a minister ready
A REVERSE VIEW reveals a long narrow carpeted pathway
leading to the house Both sides are lined with guests
who are murmuring excitedly At the moment King Westley
and his best man are marching solemnly toward the altar
Back of the altar we SEE a high platform upon which are
several newsreel men who are grinding their cameras

The guests of whom close glimpses are caught are now
peering over each others shoulders King and his best man
have reached the altar and the music of the wedding march
comes to a stop The orchestra leader is looking around
apparently waiting for a signal At the DOOR of the HOUSE
a very prissy middle-aged man waves his handkerchief and
nods his head to the orchestra leader The orchestra leader
acknowledges the signal by nodding his headdéturns to his
mendowaves his baton and the orchestra starts playing
Here Comes the Brideé6The guests whisper to each other
excitedly A great deal of stirring takes place

e door of the house slowly opensdéand a parade of small
lower girls emerges They march taking each step
arefully while they strew flowers along the path They
re well out of the way when Ellie on the arm of her
ather appears in the doorway A VIEW of the guests shows
at they cannot contain themselves Murmurs of Here she
omes and Doesnt she look beautiful are heard The
ewsreel men on their platform behind the altar bestir
emselves This is what theyve been waiting for

at5AaagmPanH

ELLIE and her FATHER (SEEN CLOSE) now make their way to
the altar Ellies face is solemn and her jaws set

ANDREWS
(whispering out of
the side of his
mouth)
Youre a sucker to go through with
this

Ellie glances at him out of the corner of her eyedand
quickly turns forward again

ANDREWS
That guy Warne is OK He didnt
want the reward

Ellie keeps her eyes glued in front of her remaining
expressionless

ANDREWS
All he asked for was thirty-nine
dollars and sixty cents thats

what he spent on you It was a
matter of principle with himdosays
you took him for a ride

This registers on Ellie and she raises her eyesdébut her
reaction is only slightly perceptible

A CLOSE VIEW of a GROUP OF GUESTS shows two girls looking
enviously in the direction of the bride

A YOUNG GIRL
(whispering)
I wish I were in her shoes

SECOND GIRL
Yes She certainly is lucky

ELLIE and her FATHER are seen again and ANDREWS is still
whispering to her

ANDREWS
He loves you Ellie Told me so
This brings a definite reaction which she quickly covers
up

ANDREWS
You dont want to be married to a
mug like Westley

At this there is a CLOSE VIEW of Westleydéthere is a
satisfied smirk on his face

ANDREWS
I can buy him off for a pot of
gold and you can make an old man
happy and you wouldnt do so bad
for yourself If you change your
mind your cars waiting at the
back gate

Ellie gives no indication of her intentions Her face
remains immobile And now Ellie and her father have reached
the altar The prissy man is placing them in position
The big moment has arrived The guests are all atwitter
But a CLOSE VIEW of ELLIE shows that she realizes that her
fate is closing in on her She looks around for a means of
escape

MINISTER

(starting the

ceremony)
Dearly beloved we are gathered
together here in the sight of God
and in the face of this company to
join together this man and this
woman in holy matrimony If any
man can show just cause why they
may not lawfully be joined together
let him speak now or else hereafter
forever hold his peace King wilt
thou have this woman to be thy
wedded wife So long as ye both
shall live

KING
I will

MINISTER
Ellen wilt thou have this man to
be thy wedded husband so long as
ye both shall live

Then SEEN at the ALTAR Ellie makes her decision She
reaches down takes a firm hold on her train and pushing
several people aside runs out of the scene Those at the
altar look up surprised and the most startled of all is
KING himself

KING
(calling after her)
Ellie

He starts to go after herdébut finds Andrews in his way
while the outcries of the guests rise in chorus

GUESTS
Whats happened Wheres she going

On the platform the newsreel men a look of astonishment
on their faces decide to follow Ellie

A MAN
Get her Mac Shes ducking

And as VIEWed by the newsreel men Ellie is seen in the
distance dashing through the gates The guests stare
dumbfounded Following this Andrews and King are SEEN
TOGETHER in the CROWD

KING
(helplessly)
What happened

ANDREWS
(blandly)
I havent the slightest idea

But his mouth twitches as he tries to keep from smiling
As King runs out of sight Andrews gets out a cigar and
lights itéda happy smile on his face which he now doesnt
try to conceal

Outside the FRONT GATE Ellie is seen in a fast roadster

as she starts away with a plunge Her eyes sparkle A crowd
of people dash up headed by King They stop dead when

they see the car disappear On the LAWN the commotion runs

high and the guests chatter their amazement A CLOSE VIEW

of ANDREWS shows him smiling with satisfaction

The scene DISSOLVES TO ANDREWS OFFICE where Andrews is
regaling himself with a whiskey and soda He is ina
pleasantly inebriated mood when his SECRETARY enters

ANDREWS
(as he picks up the
phone that has
started ringing)
Dont want to talk toddont want
to talk to anybody Dont want to
see anybody

SECRETARY
But its King Westley on the phone

ANDREWS
Ooooooh
(into the phone)
Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law
Ive sent you a check for a hundred
thousand Yes Thats the smartest
thing you ever did Westley not
to contest that annulment Thats
satisfactory isnt it Yeah Well
it ought to be Oh Im not
complaining It was dirt cheap

(as he hangs up)
Dont fall out of any windows

SECRETARY
(placing a telegram
on the desk)
Theres another wire from Peter
sir Theyre in Glen Falls
Michigan

ANDREWS

(reading it)
Whats holding up the annulment
you slow poke The Walls of Jericho
are toppling

(to the Secretary)
Send him a telegram right away
Just say Let em topple

This DISSOLVES TO the exterior of an AUTO CAMP very much
like the other camps at which Peter and Ellie stayed The
owners wife is talking to her husband

WIFE
Funny couple aint they

MAN
Yeah

WIFE
If you ask me I dont believe
theyre married

MAN
Theyre married all right I just
seen the license

WIFE
They made me get em a rope anda
blanket on a night like this

MAN
Yeah

WIFE
What do you reckon thats for

MAN
Blamed if I know I just brung em
a trumpet

WIFE
(puzzled)
A trumpet
MAN

Yeah You know one of those toy
things They sent me to the store
to get it

WIFE
But what in the world do they want
a trumpet for

MAN
I dunno

The scene moves to the cabin occupied presumably by Peter
and Ellie The windows are lighted There is a blast from
a trumpet and as the lights go out a blanket is seen
dropping to the floor and the scene FADES OUT

THE END
