BOYD
Youre a fucking moron

MICHAEL
Its my fucking opinion

ADAM
Its really a stupid opinion You
have developed an annoying habit of
talking for what seems to be no other
reason than to hear yourself speak

MICHAEL
Because my opinion threatens yours
its poorly developed

ADAM
No because your opinions are idiotic
and have nothing to do with what any
given conversation is about which
makes 85 of your eagerly injected
thought process highly offensive to
me

MICHAEL
Boyd brought up divorce statistics

ON Fisher and Moore

MOORE

As Moore moves in transfixed to take a closer look

FISHER
(enraged)
Fuck Fuck you fucking guys

BOYD
Well we can definitely call the
police Thats an easy call If we
call the police What happens

(silence)
They find a dead prostitute in the
bathroom They ask us What

Michael

(to Adam)
Your brother got a little out of

FISHER
(outraged)

BOYD
(calm)
Bury her out in the desert
ADAM
(sarcastic)
Sure why not

MOORE
Hes right

BOYD
We can take her out to Red Rock
Find some quiet place and put her

in the ground

ADAM
You dont just casually walk out of
a Vegas Casino with a dead woman

BOYD
We can do this We can get her out
of here

ADAM

Have you completely lost your mind
So you get her out of here So you
get her out into the desert somehow
without anybody seeing so what you
dont think at some point somebody
might notice that shes gone

BOYD
Nobody knows shes here I called
her personally Nobody knows

FISHER
Oh for Christsake Boyd Somebody
must know shes here

BOYD
Nobody knows

PAUSE as the guys digest this point

ADAM
Her blood is all over the bathroom
Id say thats a bit of a DNA problem

BOYD

FISHER

Oh God This is insane
BOYD

MOORE

BOYD

A reasonable question Boyd thinks BEAT

BOYD
Wrap her up in blankets Bring the
car around to the back of the hotel

ADAM
(beat)
You dont think someone will have a
problem with a body being thrown off
a balcony

BOYD
We check out the area and wait for a
time when its clear

ADAM
What about the blood

BOYD
Someone goes to Walmart gets some
buckets brushes mops Spic and
Span the works

ADAM
Have you ever done this before

BOYD
The reality is you take away the
horror of this situation take away
the tragedy of the death take away
the moral and ethical implications
of all the crap you have had
conditioned beaten into your head
since grade one What are we left
with What A 115 lb problem 115
lbs that must be moved from point A
to point B Now a straight line in
the shortest distance but we are
denied the luxury of a visible
straight line But that line exists
and I see it I see that line Trust

(beat)

Surrender is no longer an option I
repeat -- It is not an option Is

Fishers response is to join Moore as he searches for

exploration How do I function For

They start putting the suitcases in the holes

ADAM
Wait Wait a minute

BOYD
What

ADAM
We cant do this

BOYD
Weve already done this

ADAM
No I mean the suitcases We cant
bury them in suitcases

MICHAEL
Why
PAUSE

ADAM
Its sacrilegious

BOYD
How do you figure

ADAM
According to Jewish law the blood
and limbs are considered to be part
of the human being They must be
buried together or their souls wont
rest in peace

BOYD
So thats what were doing

ADAM
No were not The bodies are all
mixed up We cant do this to them

BOYD
Shes Asian They dont have Jews in
Asia

ADAM
That is absolutely not true

BOYD
(beat)
Well what the fuck are we supposed
to do

ADAM
(as if reasonable)
Open the suitcases unpack the body
parts and reunite the limbs

FISHER
No way

ADAM
It has to be done

BOYD
We have to get going

ADAM
I am not flexible on this
BOYD
Alright Lets do it

The guys start breaking down the body parts ripping

open

CUT TO
Dirt being thrown on top of the reunited bodies until
they
are all completely buried
EXT GRAVE SITE
As the last of the dirt is packed down by Boyd The
guys

stare down at the grave site

BOYD
Now I am the last to say that we
have done here is a good thing Its
not Its not a good thing But it
was given the circumstances the
smart play We did what had to be
done And well Im proud of
us Im proud of each and every one
of us We performed Under the most
complex and nerve shattering of
situations we stood fast and we
delivered I feel proud

SILENCE

ADAM
We are all going straight to hell
Either hell or prison whichever
comes first

BOYD
Wrong That is flat out wrong hell
is for cowards for hypocrites who
fear to live by the strength of their
own convictions This is war Given
the circumstances and given the fact
that we are alive and they are not
we have chosen life over death Two
wrongs dont make a right So our
conviction and execution would only
mean more death here not less

MOORE
Boyd I dont know man It just
seems to me that ever since you took
Tony Robbins self-help thing youre

all fucked-up in the head

FISHER
I got to agree with that

BOYD

That is a load of shit Personal
power has nothing to do with any of
this Tony Robbins has helped me to
unlock energy and see my options
more clearly yes but to give him
credit for this for all of this
Well thats just more than the man
deserves

FISHER
I think we should say some words
over the grave

BOYD
What kind of words

FISHER
Im talking about prayer

BOYD
Go ahead

Fisher steps to the grave looks down

FISHER
Dear God I dont know how to pray
MICHAEL
Just go ahead and say whats on your
mind
BOYD

Speak from the heart my brother
Adam turns in disgust

ADAM
This is pathetic

MICHAEL
Youre pathetic

ADAM
(turning on Michael)
What did you say

MICHAEL
(pointing)
Youre not a team player

ADAM
Dont point at me

MICHAEL
You never were a team player Thats
why you never had any friends

ADAM
I have plenty of friends

MICHAEL
The hell you do

ADAM
The hell I dont

MICHAEL

You have acquaintances -- business
friends and superficial golf buddies
You have always been a fringe player
You have some serious male on male
intimacy problems

ADAM
What are you fucking talking about

Michael looks at Boyd

FISHER
Michael now is probably not the
best time for this

BOYD
No this is the perfect time This
is real time Adam Your brother and
I as well as several others present
have always suspected that you
(points to Adam)

are a fully repressed living in

major denial locked down fly-boy

butt-fucker

DEAD SILENCE Adam stares stupefied at Boyd then
Michael

Finally Fisher says his prayer

FISHER
Dear God please forgive us for what
we have done here tonight We have
lost our way Speaking for myself
let me say

DISSOLVE TO
INT MINIVAN - DRIVING

Fishers prayer over the guys driving home Each lost
in his
own thoughts

FISHER (V0O)
Il am deeply in love with the woman
I am about to marry and I look very
much forward to raising a family and
being a positive member of society
We promise if you forgive us we
will never forget this tragedy and
will try with all our powers to use
it as a daily reminder that we are
here on earth to do good not evil
Let us go from this day forward with
new purpose and spirit You have
given us a second chance and let us
take that second chance and use it
as fuel to feed our fires of
productivity so that the spirits of
the two we now bury live on forever
in the good deeds and positive
achievements we from this moment on
shall make our lifes work

INT LAW FIRM
TIGHT ON BARRY MORRIS mid-40s attorney

BARRY MORRIS
I dont see how this could have been
kept from you The facts are quite
simple last month Adam and Lois
changed their will They requested
that you two as a married couple
be the Custodians of Record for their
estate including all properties
cash holdings security holdings
and children You are legal
custodians of the Brenn Trust

ANGLE ON

Liz and Fisher flanked by Adam Jr and Timmy eyes
wide

they sit across from the attorney totally bazookad
They

stare in horror at Morris

LIZ
My god

BARRY MORRIS
PAUSE

FISHER

BARRY MORRIS
Adam and Lois were not terribly
prudent in terms of providing for
the possibility of the unforeseen

FISHER
What are you talking about

BARRY MORRIS
Im talking about Life insurance
Im talking about money

LIZ
Money

BARRY MORRIS
Yes money Adam had a five hundred
thousand dollar Term Life Insurance
Policy

LIZ
What does that mean

FISHER
That means we get five hundred
thousand to help raise the kids

LIZ
(amazed)
No

FISHER
Yes

BARRY MORRIS

Actually no Adam was switching to
a Whole Life Policy but re-scheduled
his medical exam and failed to
make his last payment so his Term
Life lapsed So its value is null
and void

(off Lizs horror)
Now he did have a pension account
worth another 150 thousand
LIZ
(relieved)
Well oh

BARRY MORRIS
And a house Valued at 350 thousand

LIZ
So wheres that leave us

FISHER
150 plus 350 we still get 500
thousand
BARRY MORRIS
(beat)

No Not even close With property
values down the house is worth
100000 less than 450 he paid for
it With three credit cards the
minivan payments and other
outstanding debts Plus the Income
and Estate Taxes assessed on his
IRA

(punches his calculator)
Youll get oh in the neighborhood
of ah 14223 dollars
