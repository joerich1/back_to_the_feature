INT G-RIDE (STREET NEAR LAX) - MOVING - NIGHT 84

Alonzo tears open the head liner exposing a Glock duct-
taped inside the roof He lays the weapon on the seat
next to him where a ROVER plays routine POLICE CHATTER
Alonzo tears back the head liner more finds a manila
envelope dumps it on the seat -- theres plane tickets
cash pesos passports travelers checks IDs apartment
keys His getaway kit

A red light ahead Light cross traffic Alonzo notes
headlights following him Stops at the light He takes
a pull on a pint of vodka Wipes his lips with a shaky
hand

A van pulls into the intersection to make a left Too
far into the intersection Alonzo eyes it wary

The headlights pull up behind him -- another VAN --
SCREECHING to a stop at an angle blocking him The side
doors on both vans slide open Gun steel glimmers

This is it Its going down Alonzo reaches for his
Glock Hesitates Its over Alonzo lifts his chin
and braces for what is coming

BRRRDDDDDDDT Two men in each van open FIRE with heavy
AUTOMATIC WEAPONS -- AKs and HK-9ls Muzzle flashes
strobe across bandanna-covered faces and shiny eyes
These pros know their weapons

BULLETS PUNCH into Alonzo the G-Ride Passing straight
through the car SHATTERING GLASS Shattering Alonzo

84
After forever the weapons are empty Gun smoke wafts
through the intersection Alonzo his beloved G-ride

are shredded Alonzo leans forward his head hits the

HORN

The DOORS of the vans SNAP SHUT The vans take off in
different directions

FOOM A small FIRE STARTS under the G-ride leaking fuel
and fluids The flames spread the interior burns

CLOSE ON FINGERS OF FIRE

as they probe out from the bullet holes
