on the desk

Bastaldi removes the painting To him it is not a work
of art

just a commodity to be sold He opens his desk drawer
removes

several large stacks of money and hands them to Daniel

BASTALDI
Okay Now Ive got something I want to --

We HEAR the groaning sound again Bastaldi looks
irritated He

taped shut A wire noose is around his neck forcing him

to stand
on his tip toes to avoid hanging himself

The man looks at Bastaldi through pleading eyes and
mumbles
something
BASTALDI
One more sound out of you and Im going

Bastaldi closes the door Daniel looks at him
inquisitively

BASTALDI
You take someone in Give them a steady
job and how do they repay you By
claiming to misplace a shipment of your
merchandise

RAYMOND
Maybe he did misplace it

BASTALDI
You misplace your car keys You misplace

Zero stands up and raises his hand He is holding a
He aims it at Lamars head
Lamars brave exterior quickly fades now that he is
the barrel of the gun The rest of his gang turns and
Zero aims the gun at his groin

little raisins you call balls

Lamar runs away Daniel and the others smile at Zero as

up their bags and walk towards a building

Sami looks at her -- at Hadley -- at the black canvas
bag Slowly

it starts to come together in his mind

SAMI

He stares at Sophie angrily

SAMI

Her expression gives away nothing

SAMI

They send us to Zammitos house The
FBI is right across the street watching
the whole thing but they dont move A

AGENT HADLEY
Thats going to make a lot of noise
Not much time for a conversation after

Sami lifts up a heavy brass lamp from the nightstand

He pulls

the electrical cord out of the base then touches two
wires

together They spark Before Hadley can say a word Sami
touches

them to his hand Hadleys body jerks violent as he
screams

Sami removes the wires Hadley winces in pain from the
burn mark
on his hand

AGENT HADLEY
Okay Okay Weve been investigating
Zammito for years but weve never had
enough evidence for a warrant to search
his house We got word through a snitch
that Zammito was planning on taking
Bonanno out

DANIEL
We know all this

AGENT HADLEY
You just dont take out a boss You
need permission from the other families
to do something like that Our informant
told us that Zammito was talking with
other bosses and recording their
conversations in case they later claimed
they werent involved Look at these
tapes The guy has recorded every
conversation hes had for years

DANIEL
So we rob Zammito You arrest us when
we come out and the contents of the safe
is now evidence which you can use against
him

Agent Hadley nods
SAMI

key security guards at the Metropolitan
Museum The Bastaldis supplied the
artists to make copies of famous works
Theyd switch the paintings send the
originals to Paris and the Bastaldis
would sell them to private collectors

AGENT HADLEY

We know for sure they replaced Van Goghs
Vase with twelve sunflowers last week
with a copy It was on loan from the
London National Gallery and theyre not
going to be very happy when they find
out about it

SAMI
So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds
to trade up for his brother

If we got what we wanted wed let his
brother go providing he tells us where
the Van Gogh and the other paintings
are
