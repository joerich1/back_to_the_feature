Finally a cab pulls into the driveway

INT KENNEDY COMPOUND - FOYER

A JOURNALIST -- handsome yet rumpled -- stands uneasily in
the doorway

JOURNALIST
Mrs Kennedy They told me to come
up
She studies his unkempt appearance but doesnt answer The
Journalist is perplexed but strains to be gentle

JOURNALIST (CONTD)
I- Im so sorry for your loss

Jackie takes a long moment -- her voice raw

JACKIE
Have you read what theyve been
writing Krock and Merriman and
all the rest

JOURNALIST
Yes I have
JACKIE

Merriman is such a bitter man
Its been just one week and already
theyre treating him like some
dusty old artifact to be shelved
away

(beat)
That’s no way to be remembered

JOURNALIST
And how would you like him
remembered Mrs Kennedy

Suddenly stern authoritative --

JACKIE
You understand that I will be
editing this conversation
(beat)
Just in case I don’t say exactly
what I mean

JOURNALIST
With all due respect that seems
very unlikely Mrs Kennedy
Jackie stares at him polite but firm
JOURNALIST (CONTD)
Right Okay So this will be your
own version ofwhat happened

Holding his gaze she refocuses preparing for a performance
of sorts

JACKIE
Exactly Come in

EXT KENNEDY COMPOUND - DECK

Jackie and the Journalist sit across from each other at a
table She smokes a cigarette lost in the horrible memory

JACKIE

I thought it was another backfire

(beat)
I very nearly didn’t go What if
Id been here or out riding in
Virginia somewhere

(beat)
Thank God I was with him

She trails off
JOURNALIST
Why thank God

Instead of an answer--

JACKIE
Do you know what I think of
history

JOURNALIST

Of history

JACKIE
Ive read a great deal More than
people realize The more I read
the more I wonder When something
is written down does that make it
true

JOURNALIST
Its all that we have

JACKIE
Had We have television now Now
people can see with their own eyes

JOURNALIST
That tour of the White House you
did a couple of years ago for CBS
I always assumed you did that
fora purpose No After the
fashion magazines You even won an
Emmy

JACKIE
I didn’t do that program for me I
did it for the American people

JOURNALIST
That program was my first glimpse
into the White House and for
whatever it’s worth I thought you
were excellent very poised

JACKIE
Thank you

An afterthought
JOURNALIST

You could have had a career as a
broadcaster I’m sure
JACKIE
What

The Journalist looks up from his notes

JOURNALIST
I’m sorry

JACKIE
What did you say

JOURNALIST
(nervous )
I saidyou could have had a
career as a broadcaster

JACKIE
Are you giving me professional
advice

He shakes his head embarrassed

JOURNALIST
I’m not

But I’m sure that the whole country
would like to know what youre
going to do next

JACKIE

She stands face to face with NANCY TUCKERMAN her social
secretary Life-long friends Nancy is Jackies less
stylish less successful sister

Displeased with the sound of her voice Jackie lifts her
shoulders her posture more erect She tries again
JACKIE (CONT’D)
Welcome to the White House Were
so proud to call it home

Her brow furrows still dissatisfied

NANCY
Why don’t you try ‘the people’s
house’ Make it more personal

Jackie considers the suggestion And now -- with
notorious breathy diction

JACKIE
Welcome to the peoples house
Were so proud to call it home
(beat)
Better

Nancy nods

JACKIE (CONT’D)
When will Jack join us

NANCY
They want to hear from you

Jackie is skeptical --
JACKIE
They think I’m a fool -- one year
in office wasting their money
NANCY
That’s why you need to show them
what you’ve done
Nancy can tell Jackie is still uneasy
NANCY (CONTD)
The President will join you in the
Monroe Room At the end of the
tour Youll be great
Jackie smiles grateful and takes a deep breath

JACKIE
Stay close

This is the White House as seen
from its South Lawn For the next

hour Mrs John F Kennedy

invites

you to visit the President’s House
and see some of the restorations
she’s made in its interior Mrs
John F Kennedy third youngest of
the twenty-nine wives to live in

the White House

Jackies beauty has been magnified ten-fold Her nerves have

vanished She smiles radiant and

COLLINGSWOOD

the show is on

Mrs Kennedy I want to thank you

for letting us visit your
home
(beat)

official

This is obviously the room from
which most of your work on it is

directed

All around them ANTIQUE FURNITURE is arranged in various

states of restoration and disrepair

JACKIE
(playful)

Yes its attic and the cellar all
in one Since our work started we
received hundreds of letters every
day This is where we evaluate all
of the finds and see if we want to
keep them if they’1l fit into our

budget

COLLINGSWOOD
Mrs Kennedy every first

lady and

every administration since

President Madisons time

has made

changes greater or smaller in the

White House

Jackie steals a glance off-camera
Nancy reminds her to smile

With a quiet gesture --
COLLINGSWOOD (CONT’D)
Before we look at some of the
changes youve madeWhats your
basic plan

A beat as Jackie considers her motivation And then from
the heart --

JACKIE
Well I really dont have one
Because I think this house will
always grow and should It just
seemed to me such a shame when we
came here to find hardly anything
of the past in the house Hardly
anything before 19-2

Off-camera Nancy looks at her notes nodding along to
Jackies words

COLLINGSWOOD
Now suppose you and your committee
were to acquire some of the things
that are in this room what happens
when the next President’s wife
comes into the White House

JACKIE
Well if they don’t want itin the

past you see they could sell it
or throw it out

CUT TO

EXT KENNEDY COMPOUND - DECK- DAY

Jackie continues the interview with the Journalist

JOURNALIST
And the talk of the tax payer money
being wasted

JACKIE
I raised every dime privately that
we spent on that restoration I
loved that house and wanted to
share it with the American people
To impart a sense of America’s
greatness

(beat)
(MORE )
JACKIE (CONTD)
Objects and artifacts last far
longer than people and they
represent important ideas in
history identitybeauty

He scribbles down her remarks -- all cold abstract ideas
And then probing trying to find the emotion

JOURNALIST
I’m sure the readers would like to
know What it’s like to be a
member of your family

Jackie thinks -- and then

JACKIE

Imagine a little boy surrounded by
all this Having his older brother
die in battle and then going off to
that same war and coming home a
hero People see that little boy
born to wealth privilege willing
to sacrifice everything for his
ideals and service to his nation

JOURNALIST
Royalty You make it sound like
royalty

JACKIE

Well for royalty you need
tradition And for tradition you
need time

JOURNALIST
Well I guess it has to start
somewhere right There has to be a
day one

CUT TO

INT EAST ROOM - WHITE HOUSE Jackie and Collingswood now stand in the sprawling East Room

COLLINGSWOOD
This is the East Room pretty much
as Americans have known it now for
sixty years Obviously you havent
felt like you had to make any great
changes in it
JACKIE
No I think its lovely I hate to
make changes really so when you
find a room like this its
wonderful

COLLINGSWOOD
This piano brings to mind that this
is the part of the White House
where you have the musical affairs

JACKIE

That’s right this piano was
designed by Franklin Roosevelt with
the Eagle’s Support

(beat)
And this is the end of the room
where Pablo Casals played for us
where we had a portable stage built
for us when we had the Shakespeare
Players

COLLINGSWOOD
Mrs Kennedy this administration
has shown a particular affinity for
artists musicians writers and
poets

Behind the camera Nancy tracks Jackie’s every move

COLLINGSWOOD (CONT’D)
Is this because you and your
husband just feel that way Or do
you think theres a relationship
between the government and the
arts

Jackie pauses -- clearly hesitant to tread on any ground
resembling public policy

JACKIE
Thats so complicated I-I dont
know
(beat)
I just think that everything in the
White House should be the best

INTERCUT --

INT EAST ROOM - WHITE HOUSE The East Room at its most glamorous

Jackie is seated in the first row of an audience listening to
Pablo Casals play Felix Mendelssohns Piano Trio No 1 in D

The interview continues inside She sits on the couch now
across from the Journalist

JOURNALIST
Is your faith helping you

JACKIE
Id prefer to discuss my faith with
a priest You’re not a man of the
cloth are you

JOURNALIST
No I’m not I’m just trying to get
to the truth That’s what
reporters do

JACKIE
The truth Well I’ve grown
accustomed to a great divide
between what people believe and
what I know to be real

JOURNALIST
Fine I will settle for a story
that’s believable

JACKIE
That’s more like it You know I
used to be a reporter myself once
I know what youre looking for

JOURNALIST
(confused)
I’m sorry

JACKIE
A moment-by-moment account That’s
what you came her for isn’t it
(beat)
You want me to describe the sound
the bullet made when it collided
with my husbands skull

in Spanish Her delivery is practiced careful

I’m very happy to be in the great
state of Texas to be with you and
experience the noble Spanish
tradition that has achieved so much
in Dallas This tradition started
100 years ago before the
colonization of Massachusetts my

that remains alive and strong

She puts on her famous pink pillbox hat and closes the
mirror

INTEXT DALLAS - LOVE FIELD - DAY

Jackie walks through the plane She can hear the loud crowd
outside

JACKIE
(hopeful)
Is that the sound of birds

Playing along with his wife --

PRESIDENT KENNEDY (0S)
Not exactly birds Must be the
ocean
(beat)
Are you ready

JACKIE
(ironic)
Of course I love crowds

The door opens Jackie walks off AIR FORCE ONE onto the
tarmac at LOVE FIELD

It is NOVEMBER 22 1963

She is wearing that pink wool Chanel suit with navy lapels
an outfit that will soon be notorious but right now in the
morning light is cheery and elegant another fashion
pronouncement by the most stylish woman in America

Beside her is her husband PRESIDENT JOHN F KENNEDY

Jackie absorbs the roar of the crowd like a physical assault
Then sees GOVERNOR JOHN CONNALLY and his wife NELLIE waiting
at the bottom of the short staircase flanked by a saluting
honor guard

The crowds are chanting JACK-EE JACK-EE
LYNDON JOHNSON
You remember the Governor and Mrs
Connally

LADYBIRD
Welcome to Dallas Darling

She carefully descends to the bottom of the stairs where
suddenly -- Nellie thrusts a bouquet of RED ROSES into her
hands

A beat as she eyes the crimson blossoms

And then -- shouting over the screaming crowd

JACKIE
My What a welcome

The Governor places a conspiratorial arm around the President
and holds him for a whispered conference

Amidst the chaos Jackie turns around to face the CROWD
which erupts in even louder cheers She blushes almost
embarrassed and responds with a demure smile

Then she notices -- the President is on the move again She
hurries to catch up as he marches toward the waiting limo

Jackie holds a grin in place and methodically makes eye
contact with every voter on the rope line --

JACKIE (CONT’D)
Thank you Thank you so much for
coming

a stream of consciousness

Thered been the biggest motorcade

strong in our faces but I couldn’t
wear my sunglasses Jack has his
hand out and I see a piece of his
skull come off It wasn’t flesh
colored it wasn’t white He slumps
in my lap His blood his brains in
my lap And I’m saying Jack Jack
can you hear me Jack I love you
Jack

(through tears)
And his head was so beautiful and
his mouth was beautiful and his
eyes were open I was trying to
keep the top of his head down Keep
it all in He had the most
wonderful expression on his face
you know Just before they’d ask
him a question just before hed
answer He looked puzzled

(beat)
I knew he was dead

She lights a cigarette The Journalist looks up from his
notes

A TIGHT CLOSE-UP of Jackie Her wide-set deep brown eyes
are blank exhausted

Her mascara is streaked her cheeks scarred with red-brown
smudges The dried blood of her dead husband She stares at
herself in the mirror The pillbox hat is gone -- cast on
the floor -- and her usually perfect hair is tousled

Frantically she scrubs at the blood some of it still wet
with Kleenex

She wipes at her reflection in the mirror

Finally she pats her face dry with a hanging towel Then
noticing her hair she attempts to restore its shape with her
hands Her hands quiver

Frustrated she lets out a wrenching SOB And then -- KNOCK

Agent Hill Can you tell mewhat
size was the bullet

A beat of silence everyone unsettled

JACKIE (CONT’D)
I don’t think it was a thirty
eight was it What do you call it
The caliber It seemed bigger It
seemed like something soldiers
would use or maybe it was the kind
they use for deer hunting

O’BRIEN

(very careful)
Mrs Kennedy you don’t have to--

we don’t know yet

No one answers She becomes distant lost in concentration

She turns to her husband’s oldest friends the IRISH MAFIA --

LADY BIRD JOHNSON approaches Nearly 20 years Jackies
senior she is a warm maternal presence

Lady Bird moves toward Jackie as if she might give her a hug -
- but stops short repulsed by the gore that still clings to
Jackies dress

LADY BIRD
Oh Darling

She takes Jackies hand instead
LADY BIRD (CONT’D)
Can I send someone back to help you
change Before we land

Jackie glances down at her dress and seems to take in the
horror again for the first time

LADY BIRD (CONTD)
All those cameras People will be
watching

But Jackie is lost in her own world
JACKIE
There were wanted posters
Everywhere For Jack With Jacks
face on them

INT AIR FORCE ONE - REAR PASSENGER CABIN - ANDREWS AFB

Jackie remains seated as the plane comes to a halt

She watches as a FORKLIFT passes by headed to the rear of
the plane where it will unload her husbands casket

Suddenly from the front of the plane she hears --

BOBBY (0S)
Jackie Wheres Jackie

She rises -- as ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERT KENNEDY his face
streaked with tears -- comes rushing down the aisle
JACKIE
Bobby

She collapses into his arms and buries herself into his
shoulder Amidst the noisy chaos of the now-crowded cabin
they are quiet

And then -- the rear door swings open letting in a gust of
cold November air

The FORKLIFT is positioned directly outside and several CREW
MEN now step onto the plane and take hold of the CASKET

An AIR FORCE OFFICER in charge of the Crew informs Bobby
AF OFFICER
Sir theres a car waiting on the
tarmac to take you and Mrs Kennedy
to Bethesda

Jackie is suddenly panicked --
BOBBY
(to AF Officer)
Mrs Kennedy and I will ride with

OBrien pulls Bobby aside but still in earshot of Jackie

OBRIEN
Valenti wants to know how we are
going to handle the exit

The Ambulance hits a pot-hole and the Casket slides --
slamming into Bobby

BOBBY
(to Driver upset)
Hey Slow down

They sit in silence staring straight ahead

INT BETHESDA NAVAL HOSPITAL - PRIVATE WAITING ROOM

Everyone looks at the door As it opens and closes we see
the hospital personnel carrying supplies and equipment for

What follows unfolds in a splintered haze of grief
A TV set blasts the news

WALTER CRONKITE

(on television)
The President was lying motionless
in the car Mrs Kennedy was
leaning over him fully Connelly

Bobby turns off the television

And now -- he whispers to Jackie his own rage boiling
over

BOBBY (CONTD)

They want a show of grief They’re
already asking about funeral
arrangements

Jackie storms towards the operating room

At the last moment right as the door opens and she sees the
body of her husband she CRIES out -- and Bobby pulls her
back

He holds her consoling her

Later -- everyone sits the waiting room once again watching
the news

President Johnson met with
Secretary of State Rusk Minutes

conference with Secretary of

The ambulance carrying the PRESIDENTS CASKET now winds
through the darkened streets of our nations Capital

Next to Jackie in the back of the ambulance Bobby is in a
daze

BOBBY
Lyndons people are claiming I told
him to take the oath in Dallas
Asshole couldnt wait and now
theyre blaming me for it

Jackie looks out at the glowing MONUMENTS passing rows of
AMERICAN FLAGS outside government offices all flying at half-
mast

Suddenly Jackie lowers the glass barrier separating them from
the DRIVER

JACKIE
(to Driver)
Excuse me Do you know who James
Garfield was

A beat of hesitation confused

DRIVER
No Ma’am

She looks to the Nurse

JACKIE
Do you know who William McKinley

No answer The Driver glances back to Bobby looking for
help but none is coming

Finally one button at-at-time she undresses and the Chanel

She cries as she takes off her stained stockings
She scrubs furiously at the blood under her nails

She steps into the shower and the frosted glass door shuts

White House and then they walked
all the way to St Matthew’s ina
long grand procession It was a
sunny spring day Only six hundred
tickets were allotted but
thousands lined the streets and
rooftops Citizens Senators
Congressman Diplomats and Officers
-- all in their full dress
uniforms

Walton picks up a photograph

WALTON (CONT’D)
Lincoln’s mount ‘Old Bob’ was
draped in a black blanket with
white trim and tassels Hooded he
was led riderless at the head of a
miles-long procession by the
Reverend Henry Brown

Jackie stops to examine a PAINTING of LINCOLN’S CASKET lying

Jackie sees the deep concern in his eyes
respond there’s a knock --

in state
JACKIE
I can feel Jack getting angry with
us ‘There you go spending all

that money on those silly little
knick-nacks
(beat)
The man would spend whatever it
took for votes but balked at
buying a beautiful painting
(beat)
I guess we dont have to worry
about that anymore

Walton has no idea what to say

JACKIE (CONTD)

We must get this right Bill We
must get this right It has to be
beautiful

(beat)
Did you tell them well need a
horse-drawn carriage We have to
march with Jack Everyone A big
beautiful procession that people
will remember

WALTON
Mrs Kennedy You dont have to
do this

JACKIE
Do what

WALTON
In fact I don’t think theyll let
you parade through the streets

(beat)

The worlds gone mad You should
take the children and disappear
Build a fortress in Boston and
never look back

NANCY (0S)
Mrs Kennedy

Jackie turns to her old friend

Before she can

JACKIE
Are the children awake

NANCY
Theyre playing in Carolines room

Jackie considers this -- knows she cant avoid the inevitable
any longer

JACKIE
How do I do this

Nancy takes Jackies arm to comfort her
NANCY
Oh dear It doesnt matter what you

say Just hug them and tell them it
will be okay

INT HALLWAY - WHITE HOUSE

Jackie walks with Nancy toward her daughters bedroom -- a
fierce determination in her eyes

She is the executioner about to kill her own childrens
innocence

She stops at the threshold of her daughters bedroom about
to barge in -- and stops cold

INSIDE -- CAROLINE and JOHN JR (nearly 3) are drawing
with MAUD SHAW their longtime nanny

Jackie gives them one more moment and then --

INT CAROLINE KENNEDYS BEDROOM - WHITE HOUSE

--steps inside The children both turn and rush toward her
with delighted squeals

While Jackie embraces them in hushed tones

NANCY
What do they know

MAUD
I tried to explain to Caroline last
night She keeps asking for him
But she doesnt understand

Jackie hugs and kisses Caroline and John Jr leading them to
the bedside so she can sit at eye-level with them
CAROLINE
Mommy Why are you dressed so
funny

JACKIE
Something very sad has happened
And this is how we dress when
something sad happens

JOHN JR

Mommy wheres Daddy
JACKIE

Daddy wont be coming home
CAROLINE

Jackie struggles

JACKIE

Daddy had to go see your baby
brother Patrick In heaven

CAROLINE

JACKIE
Because Im here with you And we
dont want Patrick to get lonely

CAROLINE
But what about us

JACKIE
Caroline I need you to be a big
girl You can be brave right You

(beat)

A very bad man hurt Daddy Daddy
would come home if he could But
he cant He has to go to heaven

Some understanding is beginning to build

CAROLINE
Can I say goodbye

JACKIE
Yes of course you can my love

INT EAST ROOM - WHITE HOUSE

The room has been transformed into a hall of mourning

Walton has added some additional touches since the night
before -- looping BLACK CREPE along the molding a catafalque
where the Shakespeare stage would have stood

Jackie is seated with Caroline John Jr and Bobby

(Present are once again Jackies parents Janet and Hugh
Auchincloss and her half-brother JAMES AUCHINCLOSS But the
KENNEDY CLAN is now also here in full Bobby and Ethel
TEDDY and JOAN PAT and her husband PETER and their mother
ROSE Behind the family are close aides OBrien ODonnell
and Powers along with their wives)

John Jr a restless boy gets up and walks through the room
with a mischievous smile

Bobby follows scoops him up and returns him to their seats
Jackie holds John Jrs hand and pulls Caroline closer

A beat -- as Jackie clocks the anguish and pity on the faces
around her She lowers her eyes unable to bear it

FATHER KUHN
Requiem eternam dona eis Domine
et lux perpetua luceat eis Te
decet hymnus Deus in Sion et tibi
reddetur votum in Ierusalem

INT WEST SITTING ROOM - WHITE HOUSE

The immediate family has retired to the White House
Residence

Jackie stands with Bobby and Rose the matriarch of the
Kennedy clan Caroline and John Jr play with Maude nearby

BOBBY
That was a beautiful mass

Jackie is drained and exhausted The adrenaline of the
previous day and night has long since worn off

And now Bobby notices -- across the room President Johnsons
aide Jack Valenti waits in the doorway

BOBBY (CONTD)
Excuse me mother Jackie

As Bobby crosses the room and confers with Valenti Jackie
remains in her reverie Rose turns to her

ROSE
Have you started on the guest list
for the burial

JACKIE
The what

ROSE
You’1l need to pare it down dear
We can’t possibly accommodate all
these people at Brookline

VALENTI
(hushed but firm)
We need to discuss the funeral We
all want to follow her lead But
we still dont know much about this
Oswald There may be co-
conspirators

BOBBY
(impatient dismissive)
Ill talk to her but she makes the

call

VALENTI
Theres also the matter of the
Oval

BOBBY

What do you want me to do first --
plan the funeral or pack the
furniture

VALENTI
I know this is all delicate
Thats why Im approaching you
(beat)
But a procession is insane

JACKIE
Brookline

ROSE
The family plot I assume Jack
will be buried with the rest of us

Jackie absorbs this silent staring across the room Follow
her gaze to --

VALENTI
I just can’t have my President
walking Crowd full of people
Given what’s happened

BOBBY
Your President

VALENTI
My President

BOBBY
Well regardless of what happens
my brother is going to be carried
in a box

VALENTI
And I am sorry sir--

BOBBY
Fuck off Jack

BACK TO --
Jackie watches Valenti leave the room

Around her -- a new conversation -- Nancy Mary and her
mother Janet --

JANET
Averell Harriman owns at least four
properties in Georgetown Im sure
he could loan out one of them

Jackie seems completely oblivious --
NANCY
Ill ask Sarge to look into it
Im sure we have time They cant
expect us to move immediately can
they

JANET
Of course not Dont be silly

And then suddenly --

JACKIE
Lincolns widow died destitute

The others quiet all turning to her

JACKIE (CONTD)
She moved back to Illinois Had to
sell all her furniture And the
Van Burens and the Tylers too
(beat)

She auctioned it off piece-by-
piece just to keep a roof over her
head

NANCY
That will never happen to you

But Jackies not listening

JACKIE

The collectors we bought it from
Remember Bill and I had to haggle
for every sofa and every chair

(beat)
If I sell some of it back now
maybe I can put Caroline and John
through school

COLLINGSWOOD
Mrs Kennedy do you spend a great
deal of time in the Lincoln room

JACKIE
It was where we lived when we first
came here when our rooms at the
other end of the hall were being
painted

COLLINGSWOOD
Its a nice room Was this a
bedroom during Lincolns time

JACKIE
No it was Lincolns cabinet room

COLLINGSWOOD
Are all the pieces from Lincolns
time

JACKIE
Yes they are The most famous
one of course is the Lincoln bed
It was bought by Mrs Lincoln
Along with the dressing bureaus
and chair and this table She
bought a lot of furniture for this
house which made her husband rather
cross because he thought she spent
too much money

Jackie turns to a small desk in the corner A new reverence
in her voice --

JACKIE (CONTD)
And on the table is the Gettysburg
Address

CLOSE ON -- those hallowed words

JACKIE (CONTD)
This is probably the greatest
treasure in this room
(beat)

A sea of familiar WHITE CROSSES -- the 420 acres of ARLINGTON

NATIONAL CEMETERY are shrouded in RAIN and MIST

A motorcade of BLACK LINCOLNS winds through the rows of
graves finally pulling to a stop

Jackie strides forth under a canopy of umbrellas accompanied
by Bobby and Walton

Shes greeted by the cemeterys SUPERINTENDENT JOHN METZLER --
soaked to the bone

METZLER
(nervous awkward)
Welcome to Arlington Mrs Kennedy
Jackie shivers in the damp cold
JACKIE
Thank you

EXT ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - LATER

Jackie leads a long procession of AIDES and SECRET SERVICE --
trudging through the mud and endless graves

METZLER
The third option is just down
there At the base of the hill

Ahead is a sprawling green slope atop of which is ROBERT E
LEES MANSION a massive Greek-Revival structure of white
marble with 8 thick imposing Athenian columns

Metzler stops at the base of the hill and the others survey
the surroundings

BOBBY
What do you think Ken

ODONNELL
I did like Dewey Circle If we
could get rid of the leaves in
time

METZLER
Problem there is not just the
leaves Its the access roads

CLOSE ON Jackie -- as the mens’ voices now FADE a trance
settling
Suddenly Jackie steps out from under the umbrellas -- into
the rain -- inexorably drawn toward the hill
BOBBY
Jackie

But she ignores him Bobby grabs an umbrella struggling to
follow and keep her under cover

BOBBY (CONTD)
Where are we going

JACKIE
He can’t just be buried anywhere
He deserves more
They keep walking

BOBBY
Watch your step

She stumbles

BOBBY (CONTD)
Are you alright

JACKIE
My shoes are sticking in the mud

She keeps walking

Finally shes at the front of LEE MANSION staring down
JACKIES POV -- endless graves and mist below

Jackie makes eye contact with Walton He simply nods
Walton turns to Metzler whos holding a wooden STAKE

Metzler hands him the stake and Walton walks directly to a
spot in the center of the hill driving it into the ground

But Jackie isn’t satisfied She pulls out the stake walks a
few feet to the right and drives it back into the ground

It’s settled

JOURNALIST
And what about this house

JACKIE

JOURNALIST
Well you could light a fire Invite
people over The parties that you
threw at the White House nobody
had ever seen anything like that
Private concerts with artists and
friends drinking champagne and
singing-

JACKIE
Are you suggesting I throw a party

JOURNALIST
Well no not now obviously I’m
only suggesting that you’ve brought
life to a cold house before

JACKIE
That house wasn’t mine Neither is
this one
(beat)
Nothing is ever mine Not to keep

Leaving that house must have been
very difficult

INT JACKIE’S BEDROOM - WHITE HOUSE

Jackie sits alone wearing a bathrobe drinking VODKA in her
darkened room

Outside night has fallen and all is quiet -- but she can’t
sleep

Restless she rises

INT PRESIDENTIAL BEDROOM - WHITE HOUSE

Jackie steps inside another dark still room
Pausing in the threshold she listens for sound in the hall
She’s visibly tense clearly a stranger to this space

Only when she’s confident that she’s alone does she take a
breath and look around -- at her husband’s private bedroom

At the room’s center -- a four-poster bed stained wood very
masculine

Jackie walks to the edge of the empty bed She’s dressed up
for her husband -- but he’s not there

She turns to the Victrola on the night stand and turns it on
As Camelot begins to play

Jackie moves to the BEDSIDE TABLE -- stacked high with BOOKS
and bottles of PAIN KILLERS

One-by-one she picks them up reading the book’s spines and
medicine labels

She turns to the credenza -- a line of PHOTOS President
Kennedy with FAMILY POLITICAL DIGNITARIES and MOVIE STARS

INT JACKIE’S BEDROOM - WHITE HOUSE

Jackie surveys her famous wardrobe

She takes a swig from her glass and sets it on the shelf
Then she drops her robe

Jackie pulls a Chanel gown off the rack and steps into it

A beat as she considers herself in the mirror She’s as
gorgeous as ever but she doesn’t like what she sees

Jackie steps out of the gown leaving it on the floor

Another swig from that bottle and she pulls another dress
from a hangar

And now QUICK CUTS --

Jackie DRESSING and UNDRESSING compulsively cycling through
her wardrobe of designer OUTFITS while she drinks

Also-- EARRINGS and NECKLACES one-after-the-other in a
FRENZY

Finally the bottle is EMPTY -- and a pile of discarded
clothes lies at her feet

Now Jackie stumbles to her DRESSING TABLE and takes out her
MAKE-UP

With an unsteady hand she goes to work with her eyeliner
lipstick and mascara

She rises and exits

INT OVAL OFFICE - WHITE HOUSE

She slowly enters and approaches the President’s desk
She sits still in his seat tears running down her face
Jackie stares into the distance -- as Camelot ends

She lights yet another cigarette
and through her soft sobs explains
-- Jack wasn’t perfect But he was
perfect for our country

(beat)
And I ask about his flaws and she
explains--

JACKIE

(playing along)
--Perfect people can’t change Jack
was always getting better
stronger

(beat)
Sometimes he would walk into the
desert alone just to let himself
be tempted by the devil But he
always came back to us his beloved

JACKIE (CONT’D)
And I don’t smoke

CUT TO

Jackie sits in the backseat of a limousine Where - or when
-- we are isnt clear Another interview -- this one with
a PRIEST who sits across from her

I shouldnt say these things

PRIEST
Thats why youre here isnt it
To talk about what happened

JACKIE
Is this a confession

PRIEST
Only if there’s something you
regret
Resisting
JACKIE

Everyone knows my story

PRIEST
God isn’t interested in stories
He’s interested in truth

JACKIE
I came here looking for sympathy
Father

PRIEST
Of course

JACKIE
Father are you listening

PRIEST
I’m listening Yes I think so

Their conversation moves to

EXT PARK - OUTSIDE WASHINGTON DC

Jackie and the Priest walk down a long path

JACKIE
I think God is cruel

PRIEST
Well now youre getting into
trouble
(beat)
God is love And God is everywhere

She has him trapped
JACKIE
Was he in the bullet that killed
Jack

All the Priests answers are defiant and firm --

PRIEST
Absolutely

JACKIE
Is he inside me right now

PRIEST
Yes Of course he is

JACKIE
(weary)
Well that’s a funny game he plays --
hiding all the time

PRIEST
The fact that we don’t understand
him isnt funny at all

LATER - on a bench now

JACKIE
If theres a heaven theres your
God -- with all his empty promises
(angry)
What kind of God takes a father
from his two little children

PRIEST
Thy Lord sacrificed his only son--

Jackie cuts off his pat reply --

JACKIE
--And my two babies
(beat)
Arabella in the womb And Patrick
Thirty-nine hours on this earth
Just long enough to fall in love
with him

She looks the Priest in the eyes rage brimming over --

JACKIE (CONTD)
What did I do to deserve that

A long beat as he waits for her rage to subside -- and to
summon an answer

PRIEST
Nothing

Jackie falls into deeper resentment

JACKIE
Jack and I hardly ever spent the
night together Not even that last
night in Forth Worth

The Priest treads lightly --

PRIEST
Your husband loved you Mrs
Kennedy I’m sure of it

JACKIE
(bitter)
I seem to remember there being more
to our vows

The Priest looks at her with pity in his eyes And it’s the
one thing she can’t stand She snaps --

JACKIE (CONT’D)
Don’t look at me like that
(beat)
I was First Lady of the United
States Women have been doing far
worse for far less

A beat as it hangs there -- the Priest taken aback by her
candor

JACKIE (CONT’D)
There are two kinds of women
Those who want power in the world
And those who want power in bed

And then lamenting the marital bargain she made --

JACKIE (CONT’D)
Of course now what am I left with
When men see me now what do you
think they feel

PRIEST
Sadness Compassion
(beat)
Desire maybe Youre still a
young woman Mrs Kennedy

JACKIE
I used to make them smile
(beat)
No one understands the pain he was
in and how loyal he was Some of
his friends were so crude Jack
wasn’t of course But he could get
caught up in it Stillhe was a
great father
(beat)

JACKIE (CONTD)

head on her shoulder

Weve been together a long time
Haven’t we Nancy
(beat)
I used to worry that you might be
jealous of me

NANCY
Oh stop it

JACKIE
You never did anything to make me
feel that way But I worried
After I married Jack And after he
won the election

(beat)

Now that seems ridiculous Anyone
being jealous of me Ive buried
two children and now I’m burying my

husband
Nancy isn’t sure how to respond But she is no longer an
employee -- just an old friend
NANCY

You know I was jealous Of that
dress you wore in Vienna

Jackie smiles grateful for the release

NANCY (CONTD)
I know it is hard to see it right
now but you have your whole life
ahead of you

Rejecting the trite consolation --

JACKIE
That’s a terrible thing to say

They both smile

NANCY
But you do

to say

Nancy comforts her Holds her

But you do I’m sorry I’m sorry

In the lead is a DRUM CORPS

The WHITE HOUSE DRIVE is lined by parallel rows of SOLDIERS
carrying the flags of the 50 states

The WHITE HOUSE LAWN is crowded with CAMERA CREWS REPORTERS
and STAFF All are reverent silent

FLASHBULBS erupt capturing the indelible image The widow

CUT TO

INT KENNEDY COMPOUND - LIVING ROOM

The Journalist is now on the offensive

JOURNALIST
I’m only wondering if you
considered doing more to shield
them I think most people would
have--

JACKIE
We aren’t ‘most people’

Most people don’t have to make
those kinds of decisions hours
after watching their husband get
murdered next to them

CUT TO

EXT EAST STEPS - UNITED STATES CAPITOL

The caisson comes to a stop at the base of the SENATE STEPS

Oh Lyndon What an awful way to
begin your presidency

Before he can reply she walks ahead

JACKIE
No of course not

And this parade Who is it really
for For Jack One more campaign

EXT PARK - OUTSIDE WASHINGTON DC
Jackie walks with the Priest
JACKIE

I lie awake at night and all I can

think isI wish I’d been a shop

girl or a stenographer I should

have married an ordinary lazy

ugly man
The Priest studies her -- considers the depth of her

suffering He tries one more time to get through --

PRIEST

Let me share with you a parable

(beat)
Jesus once passed a blind beggar on
the road and his disciples asked --
‘Who sinned this man or his
parents that he should be born
blind’

(beat)
Jesus answered - ‘Neither this man
nor his parents sinned He was
made blind so that the works of God
could be revealed in him’

(beat)
And with that he placed mud on the
man’s eyes and told him to wash in
the Pool of Siloam’ The man did
and he came back seeing

(beat)
Right now you are blind Not
because youve sinned

(MORE )

PRIEST (CONTD)
But because you’ve been chosen --
so that the works of God may be
revealed in you

A long beat of silence as Jackie stares back at the Priest
still unsatisfied

CUT TO

INT OVAL OFFICE - WHITE HOUSE

The morning sun peaks through the edges of the drawn
curtains but the Oval Office is dim and vacant

Jackie is on her knees in a new black dress freshly
showered but still groggy

She is surrounded by the RESOLUTE DESK which John Jr was
famously photographed playing beneath

The COCONUT the PRESIDENT used to scrawl a rescue message
when his boat was sunk in the South Pacific

The MODEL of the naval vessel The Danmark he meticulously
constructed

And finally -- the ROCKING CHAIR where he used to sit the
children playing at his feet

She runs her hand across the NEW CARPET pleased

JACKIE
Its perfect

WALTON (0S)
We installed it while you were
away
Walton stands in the doorway
WALTON (CONT’D)
I thought it would be a nice
surprise for you and the President
Jackie rises

JACKIE
It changes everything

She stands admiring her handiwork

JACKIE (CONTD)
And the Treaty Room
WALTON
Hunter green Exactly as you
imagined it

JACKIE
I wish Jack

She trails off And then--

JACKIE (CONTD)
Who knows if he would have cared

She laughs bitterly

JACKIE (CONTD)
I lost track somewhere What was
real What was performance

WALTON
Well he was a President

A beat and then --

JACKIE
You were right earlier
(beat)
Ive told them Im not going to
march tomorrow I wont put people
in danger on account of my vanity

WALTON
I was scared for you I still am
But I never thought it was vanity

Jackie gestures to the redecorated room --

JACKIE
You know thats what Jack called
all this When he saw what we were
spending He said your little
‘vanity project is going to
bankrupt the federal government

This is Waltons lifes work his purpose for being --

WALTON
People need their history It
gives them strength They need to
know that real men actually lived
here Not ghosts and storybook
legends People who faced
adversity and overcame it

(beat)
(MORE )

WALTON (CONTD)
What youve done in this house
matters

Jackie considers his words Theyve struck a chord but
shes still not convinced

JACKIE
Thats kind of you Bill But even
Im starting to lose him

Pretty soon hell just be another

John blows out the candles

INT LINCOLN BEDROOM - WHITE HOUSE

Jackie sits at the edge of Lincolns arched mahogany bed
staring up at the portrait of Mary Todd that hangs above it

Outside the sun is setting
Bobby enters the doorway
BOBBY
I spoke to Johnson
(beat)

Tomorrowits being handled

Everyone will ride No procession
Jackie nods Bobby slowly sits beside her utterly defeated

JACKIE
I’m sorry Bobby

A moment of silence and then gesturing to the portrait
JACKIE (CONT’D)
Do you think Lincolns widow knew

BOBBY
What

JACKIE
That wed build a monument to her
husband

Bobby doesn’t answer

JACKIE (CONT’D)
Why is this room so peaceful

A long pause

BOBBY

Peaceful

(beat)
Every time I walk by this room I’m
reminded that on January 1 1863
an ordinary man signed a document
that freed four million people from
slavery

(beat)
So I don’t think of it so much as
‘peaceful’ but as a place of
profound legacy

(beat)
And it’s too bad that ours is
totally fucking wasted

He turns to leave

JACKIE
Bobby

He slams the door shut and turns back to her

JACKIE (CONT’D)
Bobby watch your mouth--

BOBBY
What did we accomplish
Were just the beautiful people Is
that what we are

JACKIE
Bobby

BOBBY
What did we truly accomplish Maybe
Jack will be remembered for the way
he handled the missile crisis Or
maybe he’1ll be remembered for
creating the crisis in the first
place

He sits next to her

BOBBY (CONTD)
We could have done so much Civil
Rights the space program
Vietnam

(beat)
We teed up Vietnam Now Johnson
gets to knock it down

(beat one more regret)
I shouldn’t have pushed him so hard
on Castro

JACKIE
You can’t do that Bobby

He looks at her

BOBBY
What’s wrong with you

He stands

JACKIE
What’s wrong with me

BOBBY
History is harsh

Starting to give in Jackie tosses a doll into a box

INT JACKIE’S BEDROOM - WHITE HOUSE

Jackie throws a heap of her dresses into a box

She tapes the box closed - but the tape catches on her

Angry shaking she struggles to take the ring off
Jackie swallows a pill

She catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror Lingers

Johnsons top aide Jack Valenti unpacks his belongings into
Bobby’s old office Hes interrupted by --

JACKIE
How do you like your new office

Jackie stands in his doorway

VALENTI
Mrs Kennedy Come in Sorry Im
just trying to do my job ma’am

She knows the jab was unfair

JACKIE
(sincere)
Of course you are I remember when
we won the election how
overwhelming it was

VALENTI
Everyones thoughts are with you
right now

Jackie smiles graciously

JACKIE
Thats very kind of you
(beat)
Ive come to discuss tomorrow
VALENTI
The Attorney General relayed to me
your desire for a more modest
ceremony

JACKIE
Ive changed my mind

VALENTI
Im sorry

JACKIE
I said Ive changed my mind We
will have the procession And I
will walk to the Cathedral With
the casket

Valenti is stunned

VALENTI
Well even if we could resume the
arrangements Im sure you can
understand The Secret Service
still has their concerns

JACKIE
And President Johnson

VALENTI
President Johnson would like
nothing more than to fulfill your
wishes But I have to take into
account his safety The country
couldnt endure another blow should
anything--

He catches himself

VALENTI (CONTD)
I didnt mean
If it were up to him hed do
anything that might bring you
comfort

JACKIE
Then who is it up to Mr Valenti

VALENTI
As I’m sure you know were
expecting close to a hundred Heads
of State

JACKIE
One hundred three

Surprised by her precision --

VALENTI
Yes I’m sure that’s right
(beat)
And I suspect theyll all make
their own decisions

JACKIE
Based on what

Trying to intimidate her --

VALENTI
Theres a great deal of classified
intelligence that I can’t get into

Jackie stares at him unimpressed and he knows he’1ll have
give her more than that

VALENTI (CONT’D)
Weve intercepted a threat against
General De Gaulle From our assets
in Geneva
(beat)
I’m afraid if he refuses to march
others may follow

Jackie considers this Seeming to waver --

JACKIE
(sympathetic)
I understand

Valenti thinks he’s won

VALENTI
As I said Mrs Kennedy I wish
there were more we could do to
accommodate your wishes
(beat)
I’m terribly sorry

Jackie seems to accept this
JACKIE
Don’t be You and the Johnson’s
have already done so much

VALENTI
Good day Mrs Kennedy

Jackie turns to go -- then stops in the doorway

to

JACKIE
Mr Valenti Would you mind getting
a message to all the funeral guests
when they land

Not sure where this is going --

VALENTI
Of course

JACKIE

Inform them that I will walk with
Jack tomorrow

(beat)
Alone if necessary

(beat)
And tell General De Gaulle -- if he
wishes to ride in an armored car --
or in a tank for that matter -- I
wont blame him

(beat)
And I’m sure the tens of millions
of people watching won’t either

She turns to leave

VALENTI
Why are you doing this Mrs
Kennedy

JACKIE

Oh I’m just doing my job
With that Jackie exits

CUT TO

INT KENNEDY COMPOUND - LIVING ROOM

Jackie and the Journalist sit across from each other

JACKIE
Would you like to write this down

JOURNALIST
Do you think I should

JACKIE
I I do

The Journalist opens his notebook to a blank page and begins
to take dictation
JACKIE (CONT’D)
We all live on far after our
deaths Presidents will come and go
and every one of them will look up
to Jack for guidance for
inspiration

He finishes writing the paragraph

JOURNALIST
What do you say to those who say he
didn’t deserve it The scale of it
(off her confusion)

He was a great President -- but he
didn’t win the Civil War for
instance

JACKIE

It was a funeral for the President
of the United States

JOURNALIST
Your husband drove cars he didn’t
ride horses

An outburst --

JACKIE
Yes and there should have been more
of them There should have been
more horses more soldiers more
crying more cameras

JOURNALIST
I’m guessing you won’t allow me to
write any of that

JACKIE
No because I never said that
(beat)
Perhaps Jack didn’t have time to
defeat Communism--

JOURNALIST

--with all due respect you were at
the center of it all Mrs Kennedy

(beat)
And Id imagine from that vantage
it was impossible to have any
perspective

(beat)
But I can assure you -- it was a
spectacle

And now INTERCUT -- the FUNERAL PROCESSION the Journalist
and the Priest

EXT PORTICO - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

The caisson comes to a stop in front of the White House
ANGLE UP to Jackie peering out at the assembled crowd

JACKIES POV -- looking down on Bobby and Ethel Ted and
Joan Janet and Hugh Auchincloss Sargent and Eunice

President and Lady Bird Johnson

Behind them is a pantheon of foreign leaders De Gaulle
EMPEROR HAILE SELASSIE of Ethiopia PRINCE PHILLIP DUKE OF
EDINBURGH SOVIET FOREIGN MINISTER ANASTAS MIKOYAN JEAN
MONNET and others

It is an extraordinary gathering -- manifest only through
Jackies force of will

A long beat as she takes it all in In her eyes -- the
faintest hint of pride behind the sadness

Finally Jackie steps forward and takes her place between
Bobby and Ted She wears a veil over her face -- and the
BLACK WATCH PIPERS begin their plaintive dirge

The caisson lurches forward pulled by a train of WHITE
STALLIONS and the grim parade begins

As they exit the White House Gates Jackie looks down
PENNSYLVANIA and for the first time comes face-to-face with
the scope of the nations sorrow

All the way to the distant horizon the sidewalks are
overflowing with MOURNERS

JACKIE (0S)

Nancy said they wanted to share my
grief

EXT PARK - OUTSIDE WASHINGTON DC

So I let them

She continues to speak with the Priest

But after I realizedall the
pageantry all the demands I made
to honor him It wasnt for Jack
Or his legacy
(beat)
Itwas for me

EXT PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE

Jackie pauses and we ANGLE ON Hill tensing up beside her
He scans the crowd for threats as POLICE OFFICERS on the rope
line snap to attention

ANGLE WIDE REVEALING -- the long empty street ahead

Quick CLOSE-UPS A MAN IN A FEDORA A BLACK MAN A WOMAN
and CHILD Threats Or grieving citizens

In the back of a black car John Jr and Caroline ride in the
procession looking out at the crowd through the rear window

Jackie takes a step and continues bravely marching forward

before we moved the casket to the

(skeptical)
Do you
PRIEST
I do Unless you are asking my
permission
JACKIE

No only crass self-indulgent
people kill themselves

I was just hoping

JACKIE (CONTD)
if I walked down the street next to
Jacks body maybe someone would be
kind enough to do it for me

PRIEST
In front of the whole world A
famous life a famous death

Boom

And this time -- the sequence continues

CLOSE ON Jackie -- everything that now follows tracking her
experience

BANG -- Jackie startles confused (In her mind this was
the missed opportunity to act)

JACKIE (0S)
Then boom

BANG -- Jackie turns -- eyes widening in horror as the
President grips his throat Shes about to reach for him--

And BANG -- she is showered in BLOOD and GRAY MATTER as his
head explodes all over her

EXT PARK - OUTSIDE WASHINGTON DC

JACKIE
I could have saved him

EXT PRESIDENTIAL MOTORCADE - DALLAS

Jackie panics -- climbing out of her seat onto the back of
the still-moving car

She claws her way to the rear-bumper hanging on for her
life

EXT PARK - OUTSIDE WASHINGTON DC

I should have known it was a
gunshot I should have shielded
him

INTERCUT --

She stands watching through her black veil

CLOSE ON Jackie -- back in the car where her husbands body
is slumped over BLOOD pooling everywhere

Jackie resists but Hill shoves her down into the carnage
shielding her body with his

Jackie lies prone sandwiched between Hill and her dying
husband -- trapped in an unspeakable visceral horror

Jackie reaches out for Jack’s head -- and tries to hold
together his shattered skull

We stay with her -- as the car now accelerates toward the
hospital

EXT PARK - OUTSIDE WASHINGTON DC

JACKIE
That night and every night
since I’ve prayed to die

EXT ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY

The casket is carried through the mourners gathered
JACKIE (0S)
Won’t God let me be with my

Marines fold the flag and hand it to her

She stands staring at the casket Remembering the horror of
the limo as it sped with his head in her hands

The casket is lowered

She slides Field’s notes to her side of the table

JOURNALIST

He watches her read

INT KENNEDY COMPOUND - KITCHEN - LATER

The Journalist paces as Jackie rewrites furiously

JOURNALIST

You left your mark on this country
Mrs Kennedy These past few
daysThat’s the story

(long beat)
Losing a President is like losing a
father And you were a mother to
all of us And that’s a very good
story

funeral from beginning to end
Decades from now people will
remember your dignity and the
majesty

(beat)
They’1l remember you

CUT TO

INT MONROE ROOM - WHITE HOUSE Collingswood and Jackie have reached the end of the tour --
the Monroe Room on the second floor

JACKIE

It will serve a definite purpose
(beat)

My husband has so many meetings up
here in this part of the house
All the men who wait to see him
now sit in the hall with baby
carriages going by them So they
can sit in here and have a
conference around this table
waiting for him

COLLINGSWOOD
Well he’s going to come in and--

PRESIDENT KENNEDY -- handsome resplendent -- enters the
room

COLLINGSWOOD (CONT’D)
(excited)
Mister president

They shake hands

PRESIDENT KENNEDY
Mister Collingswood

COLLINGSWOOD
Mrs Kennedy has been showing us
about the White House and all the
changes she has made therein What
do you think of the changes that
she’s made

PRESIDENT KENNEDY

Well I think that the great effort
she’s made has been to bring us
much more intimately in contact
with all the men who lived here Of
course I think anyone who comes to
the White House as a President
desires the best for his country

CUT TO

INT STAIRWAY - WHITE HOUSE

Nancy leads Jackie down the stairs out of the White House
for the last time

PRESIDENT KENNEDY (0S)
And I think he receives stimulus
from the knowledge of living in
close proximity to the people who
are legendary but who actually were
alive and were in these rooms

Jackie notices -- down the hallway Lady Bird reviews new
fabric swatches with Walton

Walton catches her glance A hint of shame in his eyes --
but this is no longer her home

Jackie looks down and exits

EXT PORTICO - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

Caroline and John Jr head into a waiting limousine
All around them the chaos of the MOVERS continues
NANCY
Everything will be held in storage

She looks back through the window to the home she devoted so
much of her life

Echoing the first scene of the White House tour -- Nancy
encourages her to smile

The Journalist watches Jackie from across the room

JACKIE
Theres one last thing -- more
important than all the rest

(beat)
You know every night before bed we
had this old Victrola Wed listen
to a couple records And his
favorite was Camelot

JOURNALIST
The musical

JACKIE

Oh Im so ashamed of myself
Every quote out of Jack’s mouth was

Camelot is all that keeps running
through my mind

a Camelot

others to believe in

CUT TO

JOURNALIST
And will those ideals live on

JACKIE

I’m sure they will Of course
there will be other great
Presidents The Johnsons have
been so generous to me

But there wont be another Camelot
Not another Camelot

CUT TO

EXT PARK - OUTSIDE WASHINGTON DC

The Priest and Jackie sit at an impasse their talk coming to
an end with no resolution

Slowly and deliberately the Priest’s face darkens -- his
tone sharpening

PRIEST
Why are you really here

An awkward silence Jackie taken aback--

JACKIE
I--I needed to talk

PRIEST
You say you pray every night to
die That your children have no
use for you That you wish only to
be with your husband
(beat)
And yet -- I’m not burying you
today
(beat)

PRIEST (CONTD)
There comes a time in man’s search
for meaning when one realizes --
there are no answers

(beat)
When you come to that horrible
unavoidable realization -- you

accept it Or you kill yourself

Or you simply stop searching
Jackie is reeling--

PRIEST (CONT’D)

I have lived a blessed life And

yet every night when I climb into

bed turn off the lights and stare

into the dark I wonderis this

all there is

Jackie’s tone softens -- the Priest’s honesty finally getting
through to her

JACKIE
You wonder

The Priest nods --

PRIEST
Every soul on this planet does

INTERCUT --

expressed her desire to reinter the

lost to rest alongside their

You got that part right

(beat)
She wants them to always remember

A moment of silence between them And he exits

CUT TO

Jackie relates to the Priest with some satisfaction --

JACKIE
He wrote down every word

PRIEST
And did that help Heal you

Jackie thinks Not exactly an answer--

JACKIE
It’s been reprinted all over the
world

(MORE )

JACKIE (CONTD)

Maybe that’s what they’1ll all
believe now

(beat)
Camelot

(beat)
People like to believe in fairy
tales

PRIEST
And you Do you believe youve
done him justice

Jackie can’t bring herself to say yes Instead --

JACKIE

I believe the characters we read
about on the page end up being more
real than the men who stand beside
us

(beat)
I should have guessed it was too
much to ask that we grow old
together See our children grow
up

The Priest studies her -- hoping she’s slowly making her way
toward some semblance of solace

But it’s clear -- she’s not yet there

The darkness may never go away
But it wont always be this heavy
Come They’re waiting for us at

Jackie looks out the window at the now-quiet streets

We hear Camelot begin to play

“Each evening from December to December before you drift to
sleep upon your cot Think back on all the tales that you
will rememberof Camelot”

The limo slows and Jackie notices

Across the street -- A MAN is carrying a MANNEQUIN over his
shoulder

Porcelain skin Jet-black bouffant Perfectly symmetrical
features

Jackie stares at a perfect plastic reproduction of herself
A surreal disorienting moment
And then ANOTHER MAN carrying another identical MANNEQUIN

Jackie tracks them back to a nearby TRUCK -- where WORKERS
unload DOZENS more of them

The workers carry the dolls into a MACY’S DEPARTMENT STORE
In the store windows -- STYLISTS dress the mannequins in
reproductions of the outfits Jackie has been wearing for the

past five days

Jackie stares in disbelief at her own image frozen in time
the widow forever in mourning

INT DINING ROOM - WHITE HOUSE Jackie and Collingswood continue their tour in front of the
cameras (Camelot continues to play)

JACKIE

I’m just so happy that he could be
proud Because then I was having a
baby and I couldn’t campaign and
then we got in the White House and
all the things I’d always done
suddenly they became wonderful
And I was just so happy for Jack
that he could be proud of me
