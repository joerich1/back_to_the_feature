Daves bestonly friend OSCAR looks up from his Game Boy

DAVE

BECKY a brunette beauty sitting just in front of them
The coolest girl in class she hardly knows Dave exists

KA-CHUNG The bus hits a grate -- Daves cue He counts
under his breath knows the precise number until

DAVE
-okayandopen your eyes

Dave and Becky open their eyes at the exact instant that the
dark tunnel gives way to the majestic gleaming spires of --

NEW YORK CITY -- The most magical city in the world
OSCAR
(back to his Game Boy)
Thatsh shome pretty lame magic

BECKY (0S)
I thought it was cool

Dave looks up to see Becky smiling at him Dave smiles
nervously back then grins at a stunned Oscar

INT MUSEUM OF MODERN ART - DAY

Becky stands in silhouette in front of Chagalls Aleko and
Zemphira by Moonlight A boy and girl levitate together in
the nighttime sky -- a childs dream brought to magical life

A second silhouette steps into frame Dave

BECKY
I love the way they float up like
that I come here a lot with my
parents I like all of the
paintings but I love this one
the most

Dave looks at her falling truly madly deeply in love --
and feeling the sudden urge to tell her

DAVE
Becky

Becky turns to look at him Dave trails off too scared to
tell

DAVE
«never mind

The rest of the class floods into the room As Becky joins
her FRIENDS Dave knows he blew it

EXT WASHINGTON SQUARE - DAY

Daves class gathers around their teacher MS ALGAR in front
of the famed WASHINGTON SQUARE ARCH

MS ALGAR
»this park served as a burial
ground in the early 1800s To
this day over 20000 bodies rest
beneath Washington Square

A creeped-out Dave stares at his feet as Ms Algar points out
a desolate-looking ELM TREE

MS ALGAR
«and this is Hangmans Elm at
300 years the oldest tree in
Manhattan Traitors were hanged
here during the Revolutionary War

A CREAKING in the withered branches Just the wind

MOMENTS LATER -- Dave watches Becky from afar
DAVE
How do I tell her how amazing she
is

OSCAR

Playah everybody knowsh that Buy
her shomething exshpensive

Dave digs his money out of his pockets Three bucks

Make that TWO BUCKS as a sudden GUST OF WIND blows a DOLLAR
BILL out of his hand

The bill hits the ground Dave leans over to grab it when a
BIKE MESSENGER runs over it The bill sticks to the tire

DAVE
Hey stop

The bike keeps going Dave runs after the bike out onto
Third Street where the bill falls off the tire

And gets snatched up by a FRENCH POODLE

DAVE
Maam your dog Stop

But the JOGGING WOMAN cant hear over her headphones

Dave chases the dog down a brick lane lined with eclectic
shops The dog spits out the bill and keeps going

Dave pulls up breathing hard He leans over to pick up the
bill then straightens up to find himself looking at —-

THE RING

-san unusual ring on display in a shop window The band is
silver an ancient design the gem is a gray stone thats
been carved into a long intricate DRAGON

Dave notices the shops sign ARCANA CABANA - ANTIQUITIES
OBSCURITIES UNUSUAL GIFTS - BALTHAZAR BLAKE PROPRIETOR

The street has gone eerily quiet Dave feels an urge to go
back the way he came but drawn by the promise of Unusual
Gifts he walks into the store going past --

THE CAR -- parked at the curb a gleaming monster in black
and chrome The 1930 BENTLEY SPEED 6 CORSICA
INT ARCANA CABANA - CONTINUOUS

Turns out unusual is an understatement The shop is narrow
but deep and packed with all manner of strange objects

An EGYPTIAN MUMMY CASEweird EXPRESSIONISTIC PAINTINGS
CALIGARI-ESQUE FURNITUREa yellow-eyed STUFFED OWL that
casts weird animated shadows on the wall

Dave FEELS SOMEONE WATCHING HIM whirls around to see --

A MACABRE URN Two feet tall it looks hand-painted by
Hieronymus Bosch TORMENTED SOULS and terrifying MONSTER MEN
writhe in agony in a nightmare landscape

Dave is about to touch the urns ornate lid when --
A HAND snatches his wrist Dave GASPS looks up to see

BALTHAZAR BLAKE knows how to make an entrance Tall and
grim eyes ringed in black he wears a long black coat adorned
with cryptic ALCHEMICAL SYMBOLS A goth-rock Lord Byron

And as Byron himself was once described Balthazar gives every
impression of being mad bad and dangerous to know

BALTHAZAR
(off the urn)
You break that one and we both buy
it
(releases Daves hand)
Looking for something in particular

DAVE
(freaked)
Just a giftfor someone special

Balthazar cocks an eyebrow He steps behind a display case
and picks up a blood-colored heart-shaped GLASS JAR

BALTHAZAR
This jar held the hearts of Antony
and Cleopatra for a thousand
yearsuntil they turned to dust

Dave smiles awkwardly unsure how to respond

BALTHAZAR
What a jar stuffed with the
disembodied hearts of historys
greatest lovers not romantic enough
for you Gee Im sorry Im fresh
out of promise rings
DAVE
Its not that Its just
(nervous deflecting)
Hey thats a cool ring

BALTHAZARS RING -- is indeed cool and very unusual a
luminous GREEN DIAMOND set in an intricate Gothic setting
Is it a trick of the light or does the ring fleetingly GLOW

DAVE
The way it catches the light

BALTHAZAR
(knowingly)
Yeahlook at that
Balthazar looks up stares intently at Dave appraising him

BALTHAZAR
I do have another ring

Balthazar goes to the front window and grabs the unusual
DRAGON RING we saw earlier He holds out the ring to Dave

BALTHAZAR
Go aheadtry it on

Dave stares at the ring feels its strange pullthen sees

Balthazar standing over him staring like a madman

Dave gasps steps back -- right into a GLASS CISTERN that
CRASHES to the floor Water and glass go flying Dave looks
up in horror as Balthazar advances

DAVE
Was -- was that valuable

BALTHAZAR
The last drops of water from the
Lost City of Atlantis Gee what
do you think Dave

DAVE
Howd you know my name is --

BALTHAZAR
Show me your hands

Dave stammers confused

BALTHAZAR
Show me your hands

Dave panics shuts his eyes and holds out his hands fearing
the worst He feels something opens his eyes to see

A WOODEN MOP -- lies across his hands Balthazar heads for
the stairs at the back of the shop

BALTHAZAR
I want the floor shined the
shelves dusted and the windows
spotless The cobwebs stay

Dave bolts for the door but the DEADBOLT has been locked with
a key He BANGS on the door in vain

ON THE STAIRS -- Balthazar drops a KEY in his pocket

BALTHAZAR
Ill be in my study

DAVE
You cant keep me here My class
will be looking for me

The door to Balthazars study SLAMS SHUT

DAVE
Please let them be looking for me

Dave looks around the shop tries hard to breathe He is so
screwed

MOMENTS LATER -- Dave mops the floor keeping an eye on every
shadow and dark corner of which there are many

He sees some OLD PHOTOS taped to the wall behind a display
case He leans the mop against a shelf and walks over to the
display The DRAGON RING sits at the end of the case as Dave
leans in to see --

THE PHOTOGRAPHS - are of a raven-haired YOUNG WOMAN alluring
and mysterious The last photo shows the woman standing in
this very shop joined by an OLD MAN

Suddenly Dave looks down at the case sees -—-

THE RING -- is in a different place Closer to Dave

DAVE
Werent you just over there

Dave stares at the ring simultaneously repelled and
attracted to it He looks both ways then picks up the ring
AN ENGRAVING is etched along the gleaming band
DAVE
Take me up

Dave turns the ring over On the other side it says

DAVE
Cast me away

The ring is sitting in the palm of his hand when --

THE DRAGONS CLAWS AND TAIL -- coil and tighten around his
finger Dave SHOUTS with surprise grows frantic as he pulls
harder and harder --

THE RING IS HAPPY WHERE IT IS

DAVE
Come on Come on

Dave shakes his hand violently then looks over to see --
THE MOP -- is moving back and forth in perfect sync

Dave GASPS freezes The mop stops bolt upright

Dave moves his hand to the left The mop SWISHES across the

floor to the left He moves his hand to the right -- again
THE MOP FOLLOWS

The world as Dave knows it has just changed Hes barely
begun to process this when --

A SUDDEN KNOCKING SOUND -- spins him around Persistent and
getting louder its coming from the back of the shop

A MAHOGANY BOX -- sits on an antique table The box looks
ancient as does the PADLOCK that secures its lid

THE KNOCKING is coming from insidethe box Dave stares at
the box wary but somehow enthralled As he lifts his hand to
touch the box --

KLINNK The padlock POPS OPEN Eyes wide with wonder Dave
opens the box

A STRANGE NESTING DOLL -- sits inside What appears to be a
SORCERER of some kind is painted on the outermost doll ina
style that evokes a medieval stained glass Creepy

-and entrancing Dave picks up the doll curious what the
next doll must look like He doesnt notice as --

THE EYES -- on the DRAGON RING begin to glow
wert

Dave turns the top of the doll which SNAPS into place Then
he pulls the top from the bottom and --

VOOOSSHHH A TONGUE OF CRIMSON FLAME explodes out of the
doll and up to the ceiling A FIGURE levitates in the
bilious smoke And as the smoke clears

DARK FIGURE
Finally finally

MAXIM HORVATH floats there an evil sorcerer of the
deadliest rank and a crazy-eyed motherfker

MAXIM HORVATH
FREEDOM BABY

Dave SCREAMS music to Horvaths ears The eyes on his SKULL

RING begin to GLOW RED when suddenly --

WHOOM A SPHERE of highly-ionized electro-magnetically
compressed matter - what a physicist would recognize as
PLASMA the fourth state of matter -- SLAMS into Horvath and
sends him flying

‘As well learn weve just seen what Stephen Hawking would

call a PLASMOID -- and Balthazar Blake a PLASMA BOLT

Dave turns to see Balthazar on the stairs his hands splayed’
out his RING glowing

BALTHAZAR
Bad news You just freed Maxim
Horvath one of the deadliest
sorcerers in history

Dave stares in shock as Balthazar vaults the rail and grabs a
large ancient tome off the shelf -- THE ENCANTUS

BALTHAZAR
Good news Only a sorcerer could
open that doll In other words --

Balthazar hands the book to Dave who buckles under its
weight Balthazar grins

BALTHAZAR
-- I just found my new apprentice

Dave stares in horror unable to imagine worse news than that
BALTHAZAR

(off the Encantus)

WHAM AN INVISIBLE FORCE ripples through the air knocks
Balthazar into the wall cratering it A CONCUSSION BLAST

MAXIM HORVATH

Dave SCREAMS Balthazar sees Horvath leap into the air
cocking his ring hand back to throw a spell Balthazar
quickly throws his hand up and -

A TEMPORAL DISPLACEMENT SPELL -- wraps around Horvath a
cocoon in which TIME ITSELF SLOWS TO A CRAWL Horvath arcs
through the air at 120th normal speed screaming like the
teacher from a Peanuts TV special 7

Dave turns to see Balthazar glaring down at him

BALTHAZAR
Wheres the doll

DAVE
Please dont hurt me

Balthazar shakes his head Horvaths ring hand is coming
forward its SKULL EYES glowing forebodingly

BALTHAZAR

All right get on the eagle
DAVE

But I --
BALTHAZAR

Get on the eagle Dave

DAVE
Im scared of flying

BALTHAZAR
New rule Dave From here on out
youre scared of one thing and one
thing only Me Now get up here

Dave looks back at Horvath sees the murder in his eyes

DAVE
Oh god

Dave tries to pull himself onto the ‘eagle arms straining like
a sixth grader trying to do a pull-up

Balthazar shakes his head grabs Dave and hoists him up by
‘the seat of his pants And with that the eagle takes to the
sky disappearing into the LOW CLOUDS

EXT FLYING OVER NEW YORK -— NIGHT
Its 3 am on the OLD CLOCK TOWER BUILDING as the eagle

soars over the fog-enshrouded city a hundred sparkling
towers sitting on a pillow of CLOUDS

The eagle circles the CHRYSLER BUILDING touches down on its
former perch As Balthazar and Dave climb off onto the
parapet Balthazar touches the eagle as if to say thanks

A gleam in the great birds eye then once again its a
LIFELESS GARGOYLE

BALTHAZAR
A man named Denethor Maltwood first
brought this eagle to life in 1928
Its helped more than one sorcerer
get across town in a hurry
(off Daves awe)
This city is full of magic if you
know where to look

f Dave locks out on the lights of New York as if seeing the
os city for the first time

BALTHAZAR
Horvath mustve put a tracking spell
on you that day in my shop

Balthazar splays his hands his GREEN DIAMOND RING taking on
a strange glow Balthazar sees Dave staring at his ring

BALTHAZAR
A sorcerers ring is a conduit for
his magic but it also possesses a
magic of its own Getting a hold
of your ring would make Horvath
that much stronger

A SHIMMERING AURA washes over Dave then disappears

BALTHAZAR
Cloaking spell Itll throw him
off our trail

Dave shakes his head cant believe this is happeningagain
Balthazar

WHOOM
Balthazar

Dave gets

BALTHAZAR
Look I know you were shocked to
see me back there How ‘bout I
give you another chance to show me
what you got Doesnt need to be
fancy Some levitation a little
stormcasting --

DAVE
Look I dont know who you think
Iam --

BALTHAZAR

Dont want to show off huh Okay

how about -- block this

sends a CONCUSSION BLAST flying in on Dave --

Dave goes sailing into a low wall and crumples

cant believe it

BALTHAZAR
Are you kidding me What have you
been doing for the last ten years

DAVE
(trying to breathe)
--Im okay

BALTHAZAR
Didnt you read the book I gave you

to his feet shakes his head

DAVE
I left it in the shop
(off Balthazars glare)
You know in the confusion

BALTHAZAR
Oh absolutely Dave Im sure the
situation was very confusing

DAVE
Well I dont think sarcasm is
really called for I was ten years
old I was freaking out Im
still freaking out Maybe it would
help if you told me WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON

Balthazar shakes his head reaches into his coat

BALTHAZAR
Pay attention there will be a quiz
later
(off Daves look)
No seriously there will be

Balthazar throws a handful of BLUE DUST that ignites the air
with a VOOSHHH

BALTHAZAR
There are two kinds of sorcerers
in the world You and I are
Merlineans We can trace our
lineage from sorcerer to apprentice
all the way back to Merlin
Ambrosius

The ignited dust lingers in the air like a nebula assumes
the shape of MERLIN ancient and wise in a druidic robe

BALTHAZAR
Then theres the Morganians

A flick of RED DUST sparks another explosion -- and a spectral
image of the treacherously beautiful MORGANA LE FAY

BALTHAZAR
»-their line runs back to Morgana
le Fay an evil sorceress who was
King Arthurs half-sister and
Merlins arch-enemy

DAVE
But -- that stuffs just a myth

BALTHAZAR

You just rode into town on a
gargoyle Dave Think its time to
put the ol skepticism in check

(continuing)
Now every sorcerer has a duty to
pass his knowledge on to his
apprentice before he dies Our pal
Horvath back there was apprenticed
to my old Master a Merlinean by the
name of Aurelius Flood

A SEPULCHRAL IMAGE flits across the facade of the Chrysler
tower -- AURELIUS FLOOD is an old man in a Victorian overcoat
Weve seen that face before the photos in Balthazars shop

BALTHAZAR
But Horvath turned traitor joined
a group of Morganians who wiped out
almost every living Merlinean
They killed Aurelius while trying
to steal an artifact of unspeakable
power the Grimhold

DAVE
That nesting dollbut whats
inside

BALTHAZAR

An evil so powerful its all
Horvath needs to kill the last two
Merlineans on the face of the Earth

DAVE
(re the two of them)
You mean

BALTHAZAR
For eons we kept the Morganians in
check Now its just you and me --
and if we dont find that doll
before Horvath does a world where
4 the vilest kind of sorcery has free
reign over mankind Unfortunately
your trainings gonna be kind of an
on-the-job deal --

DAVE
Whoa whoa training Look Ive
got a life Im trying to graduate

BALTHAZAR
Graduate Excuse me did you
hear a word I just said

DAVE
Im not a sorcerer okay

BALTHAZAR
Maxim Horvath thinks you are And
Im sorry Dave but thats all that
matters Im looking at a dead man

Dave swallows hard

BALTHAZAR
So you have two choices You can
go back to your life and have the
f highest GPA in the morgue
Loot (MORE )

BALTHAZAR (CONTD)
Or you can let me teach you how not
to get killed Your call
DAVE
This is crazy You see that
right You see how crazy this is
Balthazar shakes his head smiles

BALTHAZAR

Good luck
Balthazar turns starts to walk off

DAVE
Wait
(Balthazar turns)
Its justIm scared

Balthazar looks Dave in the eye offers his hand

BALTHAZAR
Then you just might be good at
this

Dave is pale as he raises his hand to shakes Balthazars
Balthazar grins A look that makes Dave very nervous

INT CHRYSLER BUILDING - 60TH FLOOR CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

As Balthazar and Dave step onto an ELEVATOR and the doors
slide shut

The doors SLIDE OPEN on the elevator next to theirs Two
COPS accompany the anxious CLEANING LADY we saw last night

INT AUTO IMPOUND - DAY

A YOUNG COP leads Balthazar and Dave through an underground

YOUNG COP
Unclaimed vehicles usually go to
the graveyard after seven years

of a legend around it

a Balthazar smiles coyly Oh

YOUNG COP -

Balthazar smiles as they come upon the BENTLEY still imposing
under a thick layer of dust

YOUNG COP

gonna get this old heap started --

THROOOM The cop takes a step back as the Bentley roars to
life -- an almost carnivorous GROWL Balthazar grins at Dave

BALTHAZAR
She missed me

YOUNG COP
Howhowd that thing

Balthazar takes the CLIPBOARD from the stupefied cop signs
and hands it back to him then starts nudging him away

BALTHAZAR
4 Thanks so much for your help

YOUNG COP
Dontdont mention it

MOMENTS LATER -- Dave and Balthazar sit in the idling car
Balthazar grips the wheel in heaven Dave SNIFFS the air

BALTHAZAR
You are sitting in a true work of
artthe Bentley Speed-6 Corsica
Six cylinder engine overhead cam

same engine Woolf Barnato used to
win Le Mans in 1929 and 1930

BALTHAZAR

Balthazar stares at him

DAVE
You know musty Like your
grandmas closet

Balthazar nods subject closed As he puts the car into gear
DAVE

Horvath smiles Its good to be home

EXT NEW YORK STREETS -— DAY

In a city where people dont turn their heads PEOPLE TURN
THEIR HEADS to see Balthazar and Dave prowling the glass
canyons in the Bentley now gleaming and spotless

INNER CITY KIDS working on their pimped-out rides WHOOP and

MOMENTS LATER -- The Bentley stops on Balthazars old street’
As they get out of the car Balthazar looks up in horror

BALTHAZAR
My godwhat happened here

A POTTERY BARN —— stands where the Arcana Cabana once did
YOUNG MOTHERS go in and out pushing strollers

Balthazar looks down from the sign to see Dave at the store
window smiling and pointing at a POTPOURRI SAMPLER

DAVE
Say goodbye to your musty smell

Balthazar stalks over glaring

BALTHAZAR
Are you through re-decorating
Dave ‘Cause if you are we should

‘Dave and Balthazar turn around to see Becky standing there
on her way to class looking surprised

BECKY
Wow I dont see you for ten years
and then its twice in two days

DAVE
(nervous grin)
Some coincidence huh

BALTHAZAR
If you believe in such things

Balthazar puts his arm around Dave loudly CLEARS HIS THROAT

DAVE
Oh uh Becky this is uhhh

BALTHAZAR
Uncle Balthazar Nice to meet you

BECKY

Remember Uncle Maxim is in town

DAVE
Oh yeahUncle Maxim

Never mind

Becky smiles What a couple of oddballs

“BECKY
Okay well see you around Dave
Nice meeting you Balthazar

Balthazar gives a little wave as Becky walks off Dave
sighs watching Becky go as Balthazar realizes

BALTHAZAR
She was the one That day in the
shop a gift for someone special
And youve never had the guts to
tell her

DAVE
Yeah well bad things happened the
last time I tried

BALTHAZAR
So you turned your back on love and
sorcery and buried yourself in
those books of yours

DAVE
Im still alive arent I

BALTHAZAR
Yep

Balthazar heads for the Bentley leans in to Dave

BALTHAZAR
And still alone

Dave stands there for a beat thinking about what Balthazar
said Dave makes a decision gets in the car

DAVE
I know a place we can train

EXT NYU - OLD SCIENCE BUILDING - DAY

A building made obsolete by the new science building next
door Dave leads Balthazar down some steps to a subterranean
entrance

BALTHAZAR
So why do they let you use this
storage area for your project

DAVE
Its not so much let as require
My projects kind of dangerous
Actually its really dangerous

INT OLD SCIENCE BUILDING CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Dave leads Balthazar down a decrepit hallway unlocks a door
marked NYU PHYSICAL SCIENCES DEPT

INT UNDERGROUND ROOM -— CONTINUOUS
Balthazar walks in looks around smiles

BALTHAZAR
Its perfect

‘ THE UNDERGROUND ROOM -- is big 150 x 75 with a high
ceiling and a row of opaque windows along the tops of the
walls to let in light

ALL MANNER OF EQUIPMENT -- is here ANTENNAS TRANSFORMERS
PHOTO-ELECTRIC DIODES and most curious of all --

TWO STEEL COLUMNS -- set 20 feet apart each topped by an odd-
looking DISC As well find out later these are TESLA COILS

DAVE
My projects on --

BALTHAZAR
Transducers

DAVE
(surprised)
Yeahhowd you know
Balthazar turns around smiles

BALTHAZAR
Lucky guess

INT UNDERGROUND ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Balthazar digs through his various pockets
BALTHAZAR
First we need a spellbook Since

you lost the one I gave you well
have to use mine Ah here it is

From his coat Balthazar pulls a TINY BOOK not much bigger
than a matchbook Dave grins

DAVE
UhhhI seem to remember it being
a little bigger

Balthazar starts to UNFOLD THE BOOK He keeps unfolding it as
Dave looks on with more and more surprise until finally

THUNNK Balthazar drops a MASSIVE TOME on a table THE
ENCANTUS (Below the title in Gothic text POCKET EDITION)

BALTHAZAR
The Encantus is your textbook --
not just the art and science of
sorcery but its history too A
history thats still being written

Balthazar turns to the last page a picture of Balthazar and
Horvath doing battle on Daves roof

Dave stares at himself amazed Balthazar flips back a few
pages to a rendering of THE GRIMHOLD

BALTHAZAR
Time for your first lesson

Balthazar steps to the OPEN FLOORSPACE in the middle of the
room He raises his hands throws them violently down --

VOOOOSHHH Dave jumps back as a PHOSPHORESCENT FLAME shoots
up from the concrete floor then dwindles TO REVEAL -

ALARGE CIRCLE -- 30 in diameter has been scorched’ into the
floor The circle is adorned with ALCHEMICAL SYMBOLS and
divided into SEVEN AREAS in an arcane geometric pattern We
can tell were looking at something ancient

BALTHAZAR

This is a Merlins Circle the
erucible in which hundreds of
sorcerers have been made - and
hundreds more broken An
apprentice might spend ten years
training in this circle Youre
gonna do it in a week

(steps into the circle)
You step into this circle you
leave everything else outside —-
everything you know everything
youve seen everything you are
And once you entertheres no
going back

Balthazar lets that solemn thought hang there

DAVE
So I should probly pee now then

Beat Balthazar glares at Dave

DAVE
I can hold it

BALTHAZAR
(continuing)
The circle has seven domains each
corresponding to one of the seven
arts a sorcerer is called upon to
master Theres the Alchemy of

the Mind

Dave gasps as Balthazars lips stop moving but his voice
continues in Daves head

BALTHAZAR (‘TELEPATHIC)
-»the domain of telepathy second
sight and psychic attack The

Alchemy of the Elements

Balthazar steps into the next domain and a TONGUE OF FIRE
ignites on his palm A FLASH OF LIGHTNING makes Dave flinch

BALTHAZAR
--here youll learn to manipulate
fire and water wind and earth
(steps one over)

The Alchemy of Motion is one of my

favorites Levitation telekinesis
compressing air molecules to create
a concussion effect

Balthazar LEVITATES a foot off the ground throws a rippling
CONCUSSION BLAST to knock a heavy GENERATOR off a table

BALTHAZAR

The Alchemy of Transformation

Dave stares wide-eyed as Balthazar suddenly MORPHS INTO DAVE

BALTHAZAR
---pretty self-explanatory

Balthazar reverts to form steps into the next domain

BALTHAZAR
The last two are the most difficult
to learn and the most powerful
- (MORE)
RR eh

BALTHAZAR (CONTD)
The Alchemy of Spacetime is little
understood Astral projection
temporal displacement

Balthazar takes some change from his pocket throws it up in
the air The coins start to fall in SLOW MOTION

BALTHAZAR

It took me 10 years to learn how to
cast a “speed bump like the one I
put on Horvath Its said that only
Merlin himself ever fully mastered
this domain

THE COINS -- hit the floor at full speed

BALTHAZAR z
Last is the Alchemy of Matter and
the famous law of physics holds
true it can be neither created nor
destroyed A sorcerer just happens
to know where the loopholes are

Balthazar holds out his palm and a SWIRL OF WHITE-HOT
ELECTRONS appears over his hand

BALTHAZAR
If for instance I accelerate
these oxygen atoms then let a few
electrons spin off

As a few ELECTRONS escape orbit the SWIRL COHERES into a
DENSE SPHERE OF HYPER-CHARGED MATTER --—- A PLASMA BOLT

DAVE
(staring in awe)
Plasmathe fourth state of
matter

BALTHAZAR
And the sorcerers weapon of choice

Balthazar throws the PLASMA BOLT at the GENERATOR that his
concussion blast already toppled over The bolt ANNIHILATES
the machine into so many shards of metal

Dave is blown away then realizes

DAVE
You forgot the one in the middle

Balthazar turns to the domain in the center of the circle
An almost imperceptible flash of regret in his eyes then

BALTHAZAR
The Alchemy of the Heart is the
domain of emotions love
(dismissive)
We wont be sending Horvath any
valentines Now heres how were
gonna find that doll

INT HORVATHS PENTHOUSE -— DAY

Horvath stands at the end of a long table stacked with
ALCHEMICAL TEXTS His ENCANTUS is open to a medieval
rendering of the GRIMHOLD He touches the GRIMHOLD and as
his eyes roll back in his head we --

MATCH CUT TO
INT UNDERGROUND TRAINING ROOM -— DAY
Balthazar stands over a table with the Encantus open

BALTHAZAR
Its called sympathetic magic By
manipulating this image of the
Grimhold we exert magic on the
doll itself retracing where its
been since that day in my shop

DAVE
And how do we do that

BALTHAZAR
(isnt it obvious)
We just covered this Spacetime
Dave Astral projection

DAVE
Astral projection What like
our bodies stay here but our minds
go flying off somewhere
(shakes his head)
Thats completely impossible under
the laws of physics

Balthazar grabs Daves CELLPHONE off the table

BALTHAZAR
This device converts the sound
waves created by your voice into
electromagnetic radio signals
You tell me physics or magic

DAVE
Thank you I know how a cellphone
works Its a transducer and its
- totally within the laws of physics

BALTHAZAR

Everything we do is within the laws
of physics You just dont know
all the laws yet

(holds up his ring)
This is a transducer Dave It
converts the mental energy in the
sorcerers mind into kinetic energy
in the physical world First you
think it then you do it

As Davé looks at his ring in a whole new light

BALTHAZAR
Youve spent your whole life
running from the magic you saw ten
years ago Well guess what
Youre still doing this stuff You
just got bumped into the slow lane

Balthazar puts his hand on the picture of the GRIMHOLD

BALTHAZAR
Time to get back in the fast lane

Dave shakes his head hesitates

BALTHAZAR
Michelangelo said he never sculpted
all he did was free the figure
buried deep inside the marble You
have a sorcerer buried in you Dave
Lets let him out

Dave slowly lifts his hand puts it on the Encantus As we
TRACK IN SLOWLY on his face

BALTHAZAR
Remember mental energy into
physical Close your eyes and
remove every other thought from
your mind There is only the
dolland when you can see it in
your mindopen your eyes

DAVES EYES -- pop open and Boom

who gives it to his SISTER as a birthday present

A 50-foot long PAPER DRAGON snakes down the street as
Balthazar and Dave arrive at the shop The door is locked
A sign hangs in the window BACK IN 10 MINUTES

BALTHAZAR

at stake Cant you just use your

BALTHAZAR

Commit breaking and entering
DAVE

No -- well not exactly Just a

little spell on the doorknob just
a littleyou know

BALTHAZAR

No Dave I dont know Please
tell me

(Dave goes mum)
There are limits on our powers
okay Some limits are physical we
cant raise people from the dead
We cant stop time We cant fly
Other limits we place on ourselves
The Morganians will use their magic
for any selfish thing and let right
or wrong be damned But were
Merlineans We respect our powers
and we respect our calling to use
them only for good Got it

Dave nods

BALTHAZAR
Good Now come on I havent eaten
since the Clinton Administration

MOMENTS LATER -- Dave and Balthazar lean against a building
eating from take-out cartons

DAVE
So is sorcery science or magic

BALTHAZAR
Yes And when you can see those two
worlds are actually one and the
same then youll be a sorcerer

Balthazar reaches into his carton for a BRIGHT RED PEPPER

BALTHAZAR
Try this Its delicious

DAVE

BALTHAZAR

BALTHAZAR

something you cant reduce to an
equation Look I can teach you
every spell there is to know but if
you dont find some intestinal
fortitude pretty quick Maxim
Horvath is gonna eat us for lunch

Dave thinks about this Balthazars words have an effect

DAVE
Life shrinks

BALTHAZAR
Life shrinks or expands in
proportion to ones courage

So how about it

Dave smiles grabs the pepper and shoves the whole thing in
his mouth The reaction is instantaneous

DAVE
AAAAAAGGHHHE

Balthazar points at Dave starts cracking up

BALTHAZAR

Dave doubles over spits it out Balthazar gathers himself

BALTHAZAR
Wow that was insane

Balthazar starts to walk off when Dave spins him around
throws his best punch Balthazar catches it smiles

BALTHAZAR

Balthazar walks off Dave realizes hes just been tested
and passed

As the alarm registers on Balthazars face

AT THE BACK OF THE SHOP -- ‘Dave has wandered to a part of the
shop not visible from the front A BEADED CURTAIN obscures

The old woman produces the GRIMHOLD from her cloak A

Before our eyes the old woman TRANSFORMS into Balthazars old
Master wracked by pain and misery

Horvath step back into an alley VANISHES INTO THE SHADOWS
Dave sighs relieved as the police cars approach

BALTHAZAR (0S)

Dave looks down Hes in a cop uniform too

‘The cars screech to a halt Suddenly COPS are everywhere

Balthazar plunks the GRIMHOLD down on the hood

BALTHAZAR

Alcatraz

(off Daves surprise)
A prison for evil sorcerers Every
layer holds a different Morganian
each one worse than the one before
And in the innermost doll -- the
spirit of Morgana le Fay trapped
there by Merlin himself after her
physical body was destroyed

A SPECTRAL IMAGE of MORGANA LE FAY -- is reflected in the
cars windshield A savage staggeringly powerful creature

BALTHAZAR
If Morgana gets out were dead
The sun will set on the Merlinean
line -- and rise on a world where
dark sorcery has free reign
Enough chaos and destruction to
make the Dark Ages seem like the
good ol days

DAVE
But we have the doll

BALTHAZAR
For now But as long as Horvaths
out there the Grimhold isnt safe
Nobody is Hell never stop hell
keep coming after us And weve
got to be ready for him

Not cool man

Balthazar steps into the Merlins Circle Dave sags

Balthazar walks around the Bentley meticulously wiping
flecks of dust with a cloth Dave follows him around

DAVE
Look Ive missed three classes

physics major

Balthazar says nothing keeps wiping the hood

DAVE
Come on the Grimholds safe

Dave is pissed He turns around starts heading down the
subterranean stairs toward the training room

Dave stops sees Balthazar on the other side of the car
dusting the fender Dave runs off down the street

INT PHYSICS LAB - DAY

Class is in progress as Dave sneaks in the back door and
takes a seat beside his friend the nervous-looking Ken

KEN
Dude whereve you been the last
two days You said youd help me
with my proofs

DAVE
Sorry itscomplicated

PROFESSOR HELLMAN approaches his superiority complex
oozing out from behind the glasses at the end of his nose

PROFESSOR HELLMAN
Glad you decided to join us Dave
Youre up Mr Chin

MOMENTS LATER —— A LARGE RECTANGULAR PAN sits on a platform at
the front of the room Ken hoists a heavy black CERAMIC DIsc
into the pan as Dave and the others look on

KEN
I place the metallic oxide plate
into the pan

Ken grabs a LARGE CANNISTER marked LN2

KEN
«then pour liquid nitrogen over
the plate

FOOSH The smoking frozen liquid is poured into the pan
and almost immediately hits a HIGH BOIL

KEN
The frozen liquid boils as it
absorbs heat from the plate When
the boiling stops the plate has
hit the superconducting critical
temperature

PROFESSOR HELLMAN
Which is

Ken swallows hard cant remember
DAVE

(under his breath)
91 Kelvin

PROFESSOR HELLMAN
f (reels on Dave)
Thank you Ken

The boiling has stopped The plate sits in the smoking pan

KEN
A moment ago the plate had no
magnetic properties But now that
its acquired superconductor status
I can take this magnetic disc

GS
oes

os

Ken hoists a HEAVY METAL DISC thats the size of a discus but
6 thick He holds it over the plate

KEN
-and a magnetic field will cause
the disc to hover simultaneously
repelled and attracted by the super-
conductor -- a phenomenon known as
magnetic levitation

PROFESSOR HELLMAN
Unless of course your math is
sloppy and youve made the mass of
the disc too great Then itll
drop like a stone

Hellman pompously holds up Kens proof sheet

PROFESSOR HELLMAN
Dont bother Mr Chin The
magnetic field wont be strong
enough to overcome gravity

Dave catches Kens eye nods for him to let go of the disc
Ken shakes his head embarrassed enough already

PROFESSOR HELLMAN
You remember gravity dont you
Its what some of us quaintly refer
to as a physical law

The students LAUGH Dave nods at Ken again insistent
PROFESSOR HELLMAN

As it turns out Mr Chin theyre
called laws for a reason --

Ken lets go of the disc Hellman GASPS TO REVEAL --
THE MAGNETIC DISC -- is levitating a foot above the plate

PROFESSOR HELLMAN
co Iitbut
(turns to class)
I seem to have miscalculated

The students break out in LAUGHTER as Hellman turns pale
Dave smiles the DRAGONS EYES dimming on his ring

DAVE

Suddenly the MOP veers off course nearly hits Dave before it
crashes into a shelf toppling BEAKERS

DAVE
Hey-hey stop

THE MOP -- stops abruptly prompting a grin from Dave
A grin that quickly fades as the MOP flips over and
TRANSFORMS splintered wooden arms notched eyes cloth
tendrils writhing like Medusa

Dave takes a step back --

TOO LATE The mop flies through the air like a javelin
IMPALES ITSELF in the plaster wall just inches from his head

Thatnearly killed him Dave thinks fast pulls the mop out
of the wall and SNAPS it over his knee tossing the halves in
separate directions

THE VACUUM CLEANER -- makes a sharp turn clips Daves ankle

DAVE

magic get away from him He casts his hands tries to regain
control but --

THE BUNSEN BURNERS -- have just ignited and come flying off
the shelves like mad sentient MOLOTOV COCKTAILS

tries to force it Becky turns around -- sees something

BALTHAZAR

Soyoure ready for this
Dave looks out on the lights of his childhood across the
Hudson MUSIC UP as the morning sun begins to rise over
New York the faint strains of Magic -- Beckys song

Dave turns to Balthazar

DAVE
Whatever it takes

Balthazar smiles nods Then --

- BALTHAZAR
Horvath has two more Morganians to
free before he gets to the last
doll I have a feeling hes sprung
one of them already
(darkly)
These are the bad guys Dave

DAVE
What were Sun Lok and Menmet-—Ra

BALTHAZAR
The wannabes The good news each
doll is tougher to crack than the
one before Itll take Horvath
hours to get the last one out and
that gives us time You go back

back here in an hour

DAVE
What are you gonna do

BALTHAZAR

Balthazar cant believe hes about to do this He holds out
his CAR KEYS drops them in Daves hand

Dave grins turns and heads for the Bentley

BALTHAZAR
That smiles making me nervous
Dave

MOMENTS LATER -- THROOOOM Dave revs the car looking more
determined than ever

DAVE

EXT NEW YORK STREET - DAY

We SWOOP down from the sky and GLIDE through traffic then
veer onto the sidewalk and through a wrought-iron gate into --

A GRAVEYARD -- nestled in the shadow of tall office towers
An unexpected island of tranquil solemnity

We GLIDE through the graves many of which are centuries old
finally arriving at

A MARBLE HEADSTONE -- where BALTHAZAR is crouched down Two
GRAVESTONE CAMEOS are pictured on the stone one is of
AURELIUS FLOOD

The other is VERONICA Balthazar touches his hand to her
oval-shaped photograph holds it there

BALTHAZAR
Forgive me for what I have to do

Balthazar rises turns and walks off Only now do we see the
inscriptions on the headstone

AURELIUS FLOOD VERONICA FLOOD
1925 - 1994 1967 -

Curiously no end date for Veronica

EXT VINTAGE RECORD STORE —- DAY

Dave runs up to VINYL FEVER an eclectic record shop and

peers in the window to see Becky inside Dave starts to go

in when he sees -- shes with Andre Dave takes a breath
DAVE

Life shrinks or expands in
proportion to ones courage

INT VINYL FEVER — CONTINUOUS
Becky is going through the crates when she sees Dave
DAVE
Your roommate thought youd be

Dave feels Andres stare presses on

DAVE
‘Cause if youre not theres

‘BECKY
What about your family emergency

DAVE
Family -- Oh yeah its all

Becky isnt buying this or Dave at the moment

BECKY
( Maybe some other time

Becky moves on to the next crate Dave goes after her

DAVE
Remember what you said in the radio
station how if someone told you

BECKY
What does that have to do with --

DAVE
Well this is how Id want to spend

Becky stares at Dave she cant help but be stirred by his
passion She turns to Andre who shakes his head turns
around and walks out

BECKY
(turns to Dave)
This better be good

INT UNDERGROUND TRAINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Dave leads Becky into the room which is still a wreck

BECKY
So this is where the magic happens

Dave smiles You have no idea

Dave hurries over to the TESLA COILS weve seen mostly in bg
He wheels the 7-foot tall coils to an open space in the room
spaces them about 20 feet apart

BECKY
What are those things

DAVE —
Tesla coils Tesla was a physicist
He was way ahead of his time

Dave turns out the lights leaving only the glow of a laptop
screen at the table where hes standing

DAVE
Youre gonna wanna stand back

Becky grins ‘Sounds ominous She backs away from the coils
stands next to Dave Dave smiles

DAVE
Enjoy the show

Dave hits a key on the laptop and —-

HUGE BOLTS OF ELECTRICITY -- leap between the coils These
arent puny sparks but long tendrils of high-voltage plasma
that somehow impossibly CRACKLE WITH MUSIC Bachs Toccata
and Fugue melds seamlessly into the theme to Sanford and Son

Becky laughs SHOUTS with surprise at the incredible light
and music show These coils are loud

BECKY
Where are the speakers

DAVE
There are none The coils fire at
such a high frequency the sparks
create sound waves as they move
through the air

Suddenly the tune changes again -- into BECKYS SONG Becky
shakes her head in amazement turns to Dave smiles

BECKY
Its Magic

Dave looks at Becky her gorgeous smile and he realizes

DAVE
Yeahit is

As Dave turns back to the lightshow its Beckys turn to
look at him Theres something about this guy Something

IN THE CORRIDOR -- Balthazar hides in shadow as Becky runs
out of the room down the corridor and out the double-doors

BACK IN THE ROOM -- Dave is still fired up when all at once
he becomes aware of everything he just said

DAVE
Oh noBecky wait

Dave starts to run after her Balthazar blocks the door

BALTHAZAR

DAVE

Dave sees the ENCANTUS on the table He waves his hand and
the book FLIPS OPEN the pages turning until we see --

The LIVES OF THE SORCERERS the entry for VERONICA FLOOD

DAVE
Sympathetic magic I believe we

BALTHAZAR

As Balthazar lunges Dave throws his hand up and Balthazar
slows to 120th speed SPEED BUMP

DAVE

Prime Merlinean

Dave puts his hand on the book closes his eyes and -—-

BOOM Light and time bend around us’ in ASTRAL PROJECTION
Dave is suddenly there in the --

ARCANA CABANA -- much as we remember it only theres a sign
behind the counter AURELIUS FLOOD PROPRIETOR

AURELIUS FLOOD and VERONICA stand side-by-side staring with
grave determination as --—

BALTHAZAR -- blocks the door stares menacingly at Aurelius
and Veronica PLASMA BOLTS form around his clenched fists

BALTHAZAR
Time for you to go old man

Aurelius shakes his head smiles

AURELIUS FLOOD
When will you Morganians ever learn

WHAT Dave stares in shock as --

Balthazar throws a PLASMA BOLT and Aurelius and Veronica take

‘to the air conjuring BOLTS of their own As a full-on

SORCERER BATTLE erupts in the shop we --
SMASH BACK TO
Dave rips his trembling hand from the page
DAVE
Oh my godit was all a lie
(turns to Balthazar)

Who are you

Balthazar struggles against the SUPER SLO-MO thats ensnared
him It takes everything hes got to --

TEAR HIMSELF FREE Balthazar hits the ground at full speed

“rolls behind a lab console to dodge the --

SALVO OF PLASMA BOLTS -- that Dave is throwing at him

DAVE
WHO ARE YOU1

BALTHAZAR
Dave stop --

Dave isnt hearing him’ Balthazar ducks for cover touches
his hand to the floor and --

THE FLOOR AT DAVES FEET -- suddenly LIQUEFIES turning into
a POOL OF WATER that Dave plunges into

DAVE
Whoa

UNDERWATER -- Dave flails up toward the light when he sees
his WATCH MORPHING on his wrist transforming into --

A STEEL SHACKLE And at the other end of the chain
A CINDERBLOCK Daves eyes go wide as the last bubbles of
air jettison from his lungs and he is dragged down toward a

blackness seemingly without end

As Dave reaches up toward the fading light -- A HAND SNATCHES
HIS WRIST

Balthazar hoists Dave out of the water throws him to the
floor against a lab console

Dave COUGHS violently catches his breath looks up at
Balthazar standing over him

Ae

DAVE
Iwant The truth

Despite what just happened theres not an ounce of concession
in Daves eyes But the truth is something Balthazar seems
unwilling or unable to go near
DAVE

Life shrinks or expands

remember Well from where Im

standing youve got yourself a

little shrinkage problem

BALTHAZAR
“Youre sitting you little jerk

DAVE
I need to hear it You need to say’
it So what happened

Finally Balthazar exhales and after years of keeping this
pent up inside

BALTHAZAR
Ko I was a Morganian trained in the
Dark Arts from the time I was a
boy Fifteen years ago Horvath
sent me on a mission to steal the
Grimholdand kill Aurelius Flood

DAVE
(nods )
The battle I saw in the Encantus

BALTHAZAR
(smiles at the memory)
Only you didnt see how it ended

FLASH CUT TO
THE ARCANA CABANA
QUICK CUTS -- The shop is demolished Aureliuss shoulder is

bleeding as he and Veronica stand over a battered semi-
conscious Balthazar

BALTHAZAR (VO)
Lets just say Aurelius and Veronica
put a serious beat-down on yours
truly They couldve killed me

- Balthazar lies in bed his wrists bound to the bedposts as
Aurelius and Veronica bring him some breakfast

BALTHAZAR (VO)
-instead they took me in nursed
me back to health

- Time has passed Aurelius talks to Balthazar late into the
night the shop illuminated by FLICKERING CANDLES

BALTHAZAR (VO) -
They taught me theres no such thing
as good magic or bad The magic
is neutral -- its whats ina
sorcerers heart that matters And
when my heart began to change

Balthazar and Veronica stand behind the display case
talking smiling -- falling deeply in love

BALTHAZAR (VO)
---lets just say my old pals
werent so thrilled
SMASH CUT TO

j A REMOTE COUNTRYSIDE

FAST BLURRY IMPRESSIONS -- A BATTLE takes place in a driving
rainstorm Balthazar Aurelius and Veronica face off against
Horvath Sun Lok Menmet-Ra and others who remain obscure

LIGHTNING flashes as Horvath and Aurelius clash

BALTHAZAR (VO)
‘In the heat of the battle Horvath
managed to get Merlins ring from
Aurelius For the first time ina
thousand years

THE INNERMOST DOLL -- flies open and an unforgettable sight
emerges -- the MONSTROUS SPECTRAL SPIRIT of Morgana le Fay

BALTHAZAR (VO)
---Morganas spirit was free

MORGANAS SPIRIT expands rapidly in size and energy Veronica’
SCREAMS as she is caught up in this maelstrom

BALTHAZAR (VO)
Ive got to hand it to Aurelius
He moved fast before she got too
f powerful

Aurelius lifts his hand and the DRAGON RING leaps off
Horvaths hand and onto Aureliuss A wave of the old mans
hand rips the Grimhold open unleashing --

A VORTEX OF ENERGY that encircles Morgana and the Morganians
With a final surge of magic that will kill him --

AURELIUS THRUSTS THEM INTO THE GRIMHOLD

MOMENTS LATER -- Balthazar kneels beside the dying Aurelius
who places MERLINS RING in Balthazars hand

DAVE (V0O)
And Veronica

SMASH BACK TO
Balthazar looks up still feeling the pain of that moment

BALTHAZAR
I lost her

Dave can see how devastated Balthazar still is

BALTHAZAR
As sorcerers were supposed to lead
solitary lives to put sorcery
before love self -- everything I
tried to have both love and
sorcery What I got is a pain Ive
carried since the day I lost her

DAVE
(realizes)
You were trying to spare me from
that by driving Becky away
(then)
Why is the Alchemy of the Heart in
the center of the circle

Balthazar says nothing

DAVE
WHY

BALTHAZAR

For the same reason your powers
appeared on the day you fell for
Becky Love is the most powerful
source of a sorcerers magic If
he can tap it he cant be stopped
but if he trieshe just might
lose the love of his life
coms

Dave thinks about this turns to Balthazar

DAVE
Or he might win her

Their eyes meet Perhaps each man has now taught something

and each one learned but a glimmer of hope -- for what we
cant be sure -- shines in Balthazars eyes He nods
BALTHAZAR

Lets go find your girl

INT MUSEUM OF MODERN ART - DAY

Becky walks through the museum a 1930s Modernist structure
of glass and steel She stops to gaze at a painting

THE CHAGALL from their childhood A boy and girl levitate
magically together in the nighttime sky

FLASH CUT TO
YOUNG BECKY and DAVE stand before the painting

YOUNG DAVE
Becky

She turns to him hoping he feels the way she does

YOUNG DAVE

SMASH BACK TO
Becky gazes at the painting shakes her head and walks out

MOMENTS LATER -- Becky meanders through a sculpture gallery
when a VOICE comes over the PA

PA ANNOUNCER
Your attention please The museum
will be closing in fifteen minutes

Suddenly a PRETTY GIRL runs up to Becky looking anxious
if not terrified Her clothes give her away as a tourist

GIRL
Can you help me I lost my dad
He was right next to me then all of
a sudden I couldnt find him

BECKY
Okay dont worry

Becky looks for a guard but there are none around The girl

The girl leads Becky out of the gallery and down a corridor
She takes Beckys hand flashes a relieved smile

BECKY

INT MUSEUM - DAY
Dave leads Balthazar through the museum
BALTHAZAR
How do you know shell be here Did

Dave arrives at THE CHAGALL He gazes at the painting
smiles at the memory

DAVE
Something like that

Dave scans the room looking left and right At the far end
of the museum he sees Becky just as she and Abbie duck around
a corner and disappear

Balthazar smiles at Dave Go get her But as Dave runs
off Balthazar spins around -- SENSES SOMETHING

INT MUSEUM - UTILITY CORRIDOR -— CONTINUOUS

The drone of MACHINERY and the exposed conduit on the walls
gives us the sense that this is a utility corridor

BECKY
Are you sure it was this way

ABBIE
Yeah he was just up here

Abbie pulls Becky around the corner right into -—-
A VISION FROM HELL

CHERNABOG -- towers over Becky a hulking 15-foot tall demon
with glowing eyes devils horns and massive bat wings

Becky gasps too terrified to move to speak

ABBIE
We found him
Becky turns to see Abbie smiling demonically as her clothes
transform from jeans and a t-shirt into a 17th century BLACK
PURITAN DRESS and HEAD SCARF TO REVEAL -—-

The last Morganian and the Original Creepy As Hell Little
Girl -- ABIGAIL WILLTAMS

Beckys scream dies in her lungs « as Chernabog snatches her up
by the throat pulls her up to his GLOWING DEMONIC EYES
INT MUSEUM —- MAIN CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Dave runs around the corner into the UTILITY CORRIDOR then
around the next corner where Becky was just a moment ago

At the end of the hall a STEEL DOOR swings the last couple of
inches and SHUTS Where the heck is she going

INT MUSEUM - CONTINUOUS

Balthazar doesnt like what hes sensing He runs into the
UTILITY CORRIDOR -- no sign of Dave He sees the STEEL DOOR
bolts for it and runs into --

INT MECHANICAL ROOM — CONTINUOUS

A CONCUSSION BLAST nails Balthazar sends him skidding across
the floor into a massive BOILER -- out cold

The MECHANICAL ROOM beneath the museum is a 70-year-old cavern
of PUMPS PIPING BOILERS GENERATORS and HVAC EQUIPMENT

Dave is in agony on the concrete floor having met the same
welcome a moment before He looks up sees Maxim

MAXIM HORVATH
Boy did you guys take the bait

--then Abigail and finally Chernabog holding the terrified
Becky in his clutches

Dave stares in shock Hes seen some weird sht in the last
72 hours but nothing like Chernabog

MAXIM HORVATH
Youre wondering how we got here

Horvath nods toward a shadowy corner and an ancient out-of—
service ELEVATOR its art deco doors draped with cobwebs

MAXIM HORVATH
A portal installed in the thirties
by your Masters Masters Master
It can be used to travel across the
dimensions or within them
« (off Chernabog)
Cabs just wont stop for him

Chernabog utters a low monstrous GROWL

MAXIM HORVATH
Say hello to Chernabog Conjurer
of Soulsand this is Abigail
Williams

Abigail smiles rather sweetly Dave sees Balthazar starting
to come to Dave gets to his feet trying to buy some time

DAVE
Shes the last sorcerer before
Morgana I thought each one of you
was supposed to be tougher than the
one before

Abigails smile morphs into a chilling scowl

MAXIM HORVATH
Oh boy Probly shouldnt have
said that

Abigail starts walking toward Dave Dave takes a step back

MAXIM HORVATH
You know the Salem Witch Trials
Well Abigail here is the little
devil who started it all

Dave stares in horror as ABIGAILS MOUTH opens at a grotesque
90 degree angle and --

A SWARM OF BATS comes flying out

Dave SCREAMS as the bats swarm him pummelling him He falls
to his knees conjures a FIREBALL to try and scatter them --

But the fireball MORPHS INTO a giant HELLFIRE BAT that
dive-bombs Dave sends him scrambling for cover

Chernabog grins his massive hand splayed out Horvath
shakes his head at Dave

MAXIM HORVATH
I wouldnt play with fire
scarecrow
(off Chernabog)
Not with that guy in the room

Horvath nods and the SWARM OF BATS and the HELLFIRE BAT
disappear Dave falls to the ground on his back opens his
eyes to see Horvath standing over him

MAXIM HORVATH
You have something that belongs to
me

THE DRAGON RING -- almost seems to recoil as Horvath reaches
down to pluck it from Daves finger But Horvath is a Prime
Merlinean The dragon has no choice as Horvath takes the
ring and SLIPS IT ON HIS FINGER

ACROSS THE ROOM -- Balthazar struggles to his knees

BALTHAZAR
No

Horvath grins reaches into his coat and pulls out --

THE INNERMOST DOLL MORGANA LE FAY stares out at us a
chilling medieval rendering of the dark sorceress

BALTHAZAR
Noli
Balthazar lunges at Horvath but Horvath -- his power
magnified by Merlins ring -- throws out his hand and sends

Balthazar flying into the wall pinning him there

HORVATH
Relax Blake Enjoy the show

INT MECHANICAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

THE MORGANA NESTING DOLL - hovers in mid-air held aloft by
tendrils of DARK ENERGY that Horvath has conjured Abigail
and Chernabog look on

Balthazar is pinned against the wall Dave and Becky are left
to stand together Things look bleak

DAVE ‘
Becky those things I said
beforethat wasnt me

But Becky is beyond terrified
BECKY
Whatve you gotten me into

Dave looks to Balthazar He was right about mixing sorcery
and love

THE NESTING DOLL -- starts to GROW and buckle outward now
resembling a giant egg -- or more accurately an EGG SAC
because its outer shell is no longer hard but malleable

AND THERES SOMETHING INSIDE -- TRYING TO GET OUT

THE EGG SAC -- bends in places stretches out in the shape of
a hand a head We are witnessing a sickening birth Dave
and Becky cringe as a RIPPING SOUND gives way to --

A FEMALE HUMANOID FIGURE -- tears its way out of the doll
rises up and straightens

We TILT UP the womans body as the SLIMY MUCK that covers her
flesh rearranges itself on her skin morphing into a purple-
black dress that hugs her every curve TO REVEAL -—

MORGANA LE FAY is the wickedest woman in the world and the
most seductive A wanton smile crosses her lips as we TILT
UP to her face to reveal the most shocking thing of all - By
all appearances -—-

THIS WOMAN IS VERONICA FLOOD

Dave gasps in shock Balthazar shakes with emotion Horvath
smiles at his Queen

MAXIM HORVATH
Morgana youre free

Morgana smiles draws her lips close to Horvaths -- and
BITCH-SLAPS HIM Blood trickles from Horvaths lip

MORGANA LE FAY
It took you long enough

Horvath wipes his lip God shes hot Chernabog bows his
head to Morgana Abigail curtsies

MORGANA LE FAY
(off Dave and Becky)
And these

MAXIM HORVATH
Shes a citizen Hes the Prime
Merlinean if you can believe it

Morgana takes Daves chin examining him Shakes her head
MORGANA LE FAY
They dont make them like they used
to
DAVE
(in shock)
Youre Veronica Floodyou died
Morgana smiles darkly

MORGANA LE FAY
My dear young man

Morgana draws her lips seductively close to his

MORGANA LE FAY
---do I feel dead to you

BALTHAZAR
STOP

Morgana turns sees Balthazar for the first time realizes

MORGANA LE FAY

You havent told him have you

(smiles at Dave)
Youre gonna love this Fifteen
years ago after centuries trapped
in Merlins damn little cage I was
freed But my spirit cant exist
in the open for long -- it needs a
host

Dave looks to the devastated Balthazar as the truth becomes
crushingly clear Morgana gazes admiringly at her body

MORGANA LE FAY
I hardly got to enjoy this little
filly before Aurelius put me back
in the Grimhold I cant wait to
take her for a ride

Balthazar quakes with rage Morgana smiles

MORGANA LE FAY
I bet that was funthe love of
your life sitting just a few feet
away right there on the shelf
And the only thing standing between
you and heris them

CHERNABOG HORVATH ABIGAIL -- stare demonically as Morgana
waves her hand and sends the shaken Balthazar sliding down
the wall to his feet

MORGANA LE FAY

And your job -- no your sworn
duty -- is to make sure you never
see her again

(smiles)

Youve just got to love lifes
little twists and turns

BALTHAZAR
Veronicaits me

For a moment there is a glimmer in Morganas eyes -- of
recognition and humanity Then the moment is gone

Morgana nods to Horvath Kill them Horvath powers up for
a spell when --

VOOSH AN INK-BLACK CLOUD douses everyone in midnight

BALTHAZAR
Runti

Dave feels Balthazar hoist him by the shirt and pull him as
fast as he car toward the elevator

DAVE
Wait I dont have Becky

Morgana throws a BLAST OF WIND that dissipates the cloud

MORGANA LE FAY
Nice try

It takes just seconds Morgana throws an ALL-CONSUMING
FIREBALL at Balthazar and Dave

Dave looks back sees Becky SCREAM as Chernabog snatches her
in his arms

Horvath gasps as MERLINS RING uncoils and the DRAGON LEAPS
from his finger

Balthazar pulls Dave into the elevator and dives for the
antiquated UPDOWN LEVER

THE FIREBALL -- flies in on Balthazar and Dave

THE DRAGON RING -- leaps across the floor in two big bounds
jumps into the elevator and onto Daves finger and then --

The fireball EXPLODES into the elevator shaft incinerating
everything in it

As the flames subside the Morganians stand at what used to
be the elevator door Dave and Balthazar are --

MAXIM HORVATH
Gone And so is Merlins ring

MORGANA LE FAY
It doesnt matter Its work is
done

ABIGAIL WILLIAMS
What should we do with this one

Morgana smiles as Becky struggles in Chernabogs arms
MORGANA LE FAY
I’m sure Ill think of something

throw a CONCUSSION BLAST that sends Chernabog flying --

WHAM -- into one of the archs concrete supports

Gravity does the rest Chernabog looks up as the MASSIVE
CONCRETE ARCH comes down on him —- KA-BOOOOM

ABATTALION OF WRAITHS -- their claw-like hands holding sabres
and muskets their skulls grinning murderously in the
moonlight The Wraiths have cut off Dave from the Grimhold

Dave and Becky step back in awe of these horrors

MORGANA LE FAY

Ah the proud Merlinean line
Names like AmbrosiusMaltwood
Garcia de AyalaDave

(shakes her head)
How the mighty have fallen Merlin
wouldve thanked me-for what Im
about to do

But as she raises her hand —-

BALTHAZAR (0S)
Or he wouldve mopped up the floor
with you
Morgaha turns toward the voice

BALTHAZAR
-again

BALTHAZAR --— steps forward flanked by the CHRYSLER EAGLE and

the massively muscled ROCKEFELLER ATLAS » as epically heroic as

the day Dave first saw him
Dave and Becky smile Surprisingly so does Morgana

MORGANA LE FAY
Now this is how we used to do it

Morgana throws a PLASMA BOLT and its on a clash as physical

-as it is magical with our heroes having to simultaneously

battle the MORGANIANS and the WRAITHS

QUICK CUTS -- Balthazar dodges Horvaths LIGHTNING BOLTS
seizes a WRAITHS SWORD and fights like a man possessed

MORGANA -- summons a CYCLONE down from the skies sends it
careening toward Dave

DAVE -- throws out his hands then rips them apart tearing
Morganas CYCLONE into a dozen MINI-CYCLONES each of which
flies into a WRAITH blasting it to smithereens

BECKY -- sees the GRIMHOLD on the ground and runs for it

Suddenly Becky falls -- trapped in QUICKSAND Abigail closes

in for the kill
Dave sees Becky in trouble runs to help her

MORGANA LE FAY
Fool

Morgana sends a CONCUSSION BLAST rippling through the air --
ATLAS -- jumps in front of Dave absorbing the impact

Atlas punches Morgana with a massive STEEL FIST Her head
barely turns She backhands Atlas sends him flying

ABIGAIL -- sees Dave on his way to help Becky She opens
her mouth at a horrific angle only this time she
projectile-vomits --

A SWARM OF ANGRY WASPS

But the CHRYSLER EAGLE flies in sends the wasps scattering
Abigail has no time to get out of the way as --

WHAM The eagle clips her with its wing -- KNOCKS HER
UNCONSCIOUS ©
BECKY -- is about to be pulled under the quicksand when Dave

lifts her out with an ANTI-GRAVITY SPELL He levitates into
the air to catch her and for a heartbeat they hang there like
the boy and girl in the Chagall painting

Dave sets the two of them down looks into Beckys eyes

DAVE
Becky I --

But Horvath touches his hand to the ground sends a RIPPLING
SHOCKWAVE that uproots Dave and sends him slamming into a
lamp post

DAVE
Unnfffi

As ATLAS and the CHRYSLER EAGLE wade into the slashing
WRAITHS and Balthazar faces off against Morgana Horvath
casts a withering assault of sorcery at Dave

A FIREBALL nearly incinerates him A CONCUSSION BLAST sends
him flying into --

WHAM -- an aluminum TOOL SHED Dave plows through the
shed and keeps going landing hard on his back

Horvath walks toward him picks up a shovel In Horvaths
hands the shovel MORPHS INTO an EXECUTIONERS AXE

MAXIM HORVATH
“There s no magic or science that
can save you now apprentice

Horvath stands over Dave brings the axe back

Dave looks over sees Becky looking sorrowfully at him Then
unexpectedly he smiles

DAVE
Ilove you

AN UNTAPPED POWER lights in Daves eyes Becky smiles
through her tears as Dave looks up at Horvath

DAVE
Objects in motion stay in motion

Horvath pauses with the axe --

A HORVATH
Boy what are you talking about

WHOOSH Horvath looks up as --

A ROCK the size of a basketball nails him in the chest and

sends him flying -- WHAM -- into a TREE TRUNK
‘DAVE
---unless acted upon by an opposing
force

Horvath is in serious pain as he gets up sees Dave walking
toward him Dave looks transformed as if a veil has been
lifted and science and magic are one within him

DAVE
Newtons first law Number two
The acceleration of an object is
directly proportional to the net
force acting on it For example

Dave throws a massive PLASMA BOLT that SLAMS into Horvath
drops him like a stone

fo DAVE
And my personal favorite number
three for every action

Dave hoists Horvath in the grip of an INVISIBLE GRAVITY and
flings him -- WHAM -- into the base of a CIVIL WAR MONUMENT
spider-webbing the marble

‘Horvath staggers teeters like a punch-drunk boxer

DAVE
--theres an equal and opposite
reaction

WHUMP Horvath lands hard out cold Dave stands
triumphantly over him a sorcerer now

DAVE
Physics

MEANWHILE

Balthazar and Morgana wage FIERCE SORCERER WARFARE mixing
spells culled from all Seven Alchemies -- a Master Class

Fighting Morgana is all the more difficult because for every
PLASMA BOLT he sends slamming into Morgana Balthazar knows
its Veronicas body hes harming

But that doesnt stop him Morgana goes down winces in
pain For a moment Balthazar forgets who hes dealing with

BALTHAZAR
Veronica you dont want to do this

A moment is all it takes Morgana throws out her hand
BASHES Balthazar with an invisible force -- then brings her
hand down SMASHING him to the ground

The DRAGONS EYES glow on Daves ring as he turns his
outstretched hand to the side -- and the doll TWISTS OPEN

MORGANA LE FAY
NOI

A BLINDING LIGHT -- shines in the seam of the doll swells
into a VORTEX OF LIGHT

Morgana digs her fingers into the ground fighting the awesome
suction that pulls her toward the light

ABIGAIL -- SCREAMS as she tumbles through the air gets
sucked into the vortex

HORVATH -- resists for as long as he can until he too
vanishes into the light

Becky ducks as the unconscious CHERNABOG comes flying through
( the air into the vortex

MORGANA -- cant hold on She slips flies through the air --

é
A HAND -- shoots out catches her hand BALTHAZARS
DAVE
No What are you doing
Balthazar holds onto Morgana with all the strength he has
left

DAVE

BALTHAZAR
(shakes his head)
Not this timenot this time

MASSIVE BOOM OF THUNDER echoes across New York And when the
echo fades

THE SEALED GRIMHOLD -- sits in a smoking smoldering crater
THE WRAITHS -- are suddenly drawn up into the air away from
their battle with Atlas and the Chrysler Eagle growing more
spectral every second
