EXT “THE MEADOW” A VIRGINIA HORSE FARM —- DAY

It’s a cold bleak day and Penny rides in the passenger seat
of the rental car as Jack drives their family toward the home
Penny grew up in--the main house of a horse breeding farm
Penny has a handwritten list

PENNY
I’ve called the schools Sarah I
couldn’t reach your volleyball
coach but I’11 reach him sometime
today John your teacher said you
can make up the math test Monday

KATE
I’m gonna miss rehearsals They
said youd lose your role if you
miss rehearsals

JACK
War Protestors are inherently
irresponsible Tell them you were
just getting into character

PENNY
You’re not going to lose the role
I’1l speak to them this afternoon

JACK
Don’t forget to call the Johnsons
and tell them we’1ll miss dinner
tomorrow night

Penny adds to her list Jack turns the car into a lane
marked by a sign MEADOWS STABLES The lane leads past weed-
choked rail fences to a stately house that needs paint A
dozen cars are parked outside

INT MAIN HOUSE - THE MEADOWS — DAY

Penny leads her family inside old friends of her parents are
gathered in groups throughout the main rooms there to pay
their respects MISS HAM mid-60’s with Old Virginia
manners moves immediately to greet her with a genteel hug

MISS HAM
Penny Darlin’ I’m so so sorry

PENNY
Miss Ham Jack kids you remember
Miss Ham Granddaddy’s secretary

Penny’s children nod politely Jack has things on his mind

Page 5 of 113
JACK
Nice to see you Could I find a
phone I need to make some calls

MISS HAM
Of course please use my office

Jack hurries off without a word Miss Ham’s eyes full of
wisdom and sympathy drift back to Penny

PENNY
Thank you so much For everything
Hollis said you found her in the
kitchen

MISS HAM
She was making your father his
sandwich and just fell over The
doctor said she didn’t suffer She
looked peaceful even there

PENNY
How is Daddy

Daddy seems a childlike term for a grown woman to use about
her father but it’s what Southerners say til their own dying

day

Miss

(The

Miss Ham’s eyes tell Penny the situation is grim

MISS HAM
He keeps asking Where is she I’m
not sure if he means your Mother
or you

Ham looks down a long hallway where none of the guests

Penny turns to her daughters and speaks quietly

boys have already approached the food table)

PENNY
I’m gonna go see your Granddaddy
and then I’1l1 bring you in I know
all this isn’t easy for you it’s
frightening it’s a terrible time
But Grandma is with the angels
And today you become women

MISS HAM
Come on Girls let’s get you
something to eat

As Miss Ham ushers the girls away she glances back once more

to Penny

We FOLLOW PENNY as she moves down the long hallway lined
with pictures of racehorses toward the door at the end

Page 6 of 113
As she walks MEMORIES OF HORSERACING--wild vibrant
colorful--bang into her spirit colliding and contrasting
with the somber gray of her life in general and this moment
in particular We see WHAT SHE SEES IN HER MEMORY

--A little girl--Penny at 6--standing at the rail of a
racetrack beside her tall handsome father—-CHRISTOPHER
CHENERY--in the prime of his life as the crowd thunders
around them

--A pack of racehorses rounding a turn and heading into the
home stretch hooves pounding muscles rippling colors
flashing the horses thundering toward the wire Her
father’s horse wins and BULL HANCOCK (a friend we’1l come to
know) claps him on the back in celebration

Young Penny looks up at her Dad he smiles down at her and
takes her hand

CHRIS CHENERY
We let ’em run Penny We always
let ’em run

And ADULT PENNY walks toward his office door Pausing for
the slightest moment to steel herself she opens the door

This is the office of a man who has achieved a great deal
having started from the humblest beginnings On the walls
are pictures of Christopher Chenery with President Kennedy
another with President Johnson In one photo Chris is
cutting a ribbon at the dedication of a massive power
station But most of the shots are of him with horses

We PAN ACROSS the pictures to find Chris Chenery now he’s
dressed his hair is combed but he’s late 70s now and
thinner his mind drifting into dementia As Penny enters-—-

CHRISTOPHER
Helen Where’s my sandwich

There is already a sandwich on the table beside him Penny
leans and kisses him tenderly on the cheek

PENNY
Hi Daddy It’s Penny

She sits on the ottoman in front of him and takes his hands

in hers He doesn’t respond except to frown slightly like
aman who is troubled by a memory no more than a hunch

Penny is doing everything she can to be strong to see the
situation clearly But it’s hard to see clearly when tears
are dripping from your eyes

INT MAIN HOUSE - THE MEADOWS - MAIN ROOM - DAY

More people are gathered in small knots of mumbling mourners
in the house’s expansive main room Jack has returned from
his phone calls and is talking with HOLLIS CHENERY 50
Penny’s brother He’s a tall man soft from a life of desk
work sorting through investments

HOLLIS
The farm won’t bring much Id
rather be liquid and have the money
in stocks When this Vietnam thing
ends I see a bull market

Penny spots him and moves up they hug

PENNY
Hollis

HOLLIS
You just saw Father

She can only nod Her eyes find her children standing at
the window and looking out at the horses in the fields and
wishing they could be anyplace but here

HOLLIS
I hadn’t realized how quickly he
was losing it When I’d call it
would always be Mother on the
phone

PENNY
Yes We’ve got a lot to deal with

Page 8 of 113
HOLLIS
You know the Estate Tax is seventy
percent

PENNY
Jack’s told me about the taxes I
meant——

HOLLIS

into shelters we could lose almost
everything

JACK

PENNY
Excuse me I need to see to the
children

So how’s business in New York

As her husband and brother talk shop Penny moves to her
children at the window She kneels and whispers to them—-

PENNY
I’11l take you in to see Granddaddy
I just need a minute

The girls squeeze her waist understanding as women
instinctively do that grief means love

Penny looks outside standing cut by the paddock fence is
EDDIE SWEAT 33 black the farm’s horse-groom he’s in his
work clothes At that moment CARL HATTON 40’s the horse-—
trainer comes up and begins to berate him because no
training is going on Eddie gestures sadly toward the house

Penny closes her eyes When she opens them she is--

squeezes her father’s handand he squeezes back

EXT CEMETERY - LATER

As the mourners are making their way to their cars Penny
sees the groom Eddie Sweat and moves up to him (Miss Ham
is helping Chris Chenery to the car)

PENNY
Eddie Thank you for coming

EDDIE
Miss Penny Your Mama was a fine
woman I feel real bad for Mister

1h)

Hollis pours himself a drink Penny’s staring out the window
The funeral visitors have gone it’s now just family

HOLLIS
Doctor says there may be some brief
moments when he’s aware of things
but we shouldn’t expect much
Especially after this

He takes a drink he needs it

Page 11 of 113
No reply

HOLLIS
Practical thing would be to put him
in a nursing home

PENNY
This is home to him he knows he’s
here As long as he does I think
we should hire nurses and let him
stay at home

HOLLIS
The farm needs to go I just
checked the books it’s been losing
money for years

Hollis knows his younger sister can be stubborn

HOLLIS
Look I know you loved this place
we all did okay But he made it
work he once made lots of things
work He’s not that man anymore
and we have to face facts To run
a racehorse business you need a
certain touch I’m a stockbroker
and you‘re a housewife

He takes another drink and Penny’s eyes move from him to
Jack and their children visible through the door into the

next room

Jack is on the phone while the kids look through

old photo albums Jack hangs up and moves in to join them

JACK
I’ve moved up our flight to first
thing tomorrow we gotta get back

PENNY
I need to stay a few days longer
Find the right nurse for Daddy
sort through Mother’s things

JACK
But I just changed your ticket

PENNY
This place is a mess And somebody
needs to make sure Daddy is all

HOLLIS
We need to file right away to get
his power of attorney Miss Ham

best horses last month for half of
what they’re worth Mom had to
step in and stop him Now

INT MAIN HOUSE AT “THE MEADOW” — GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

Penny can’t sleep Jack’s next to her no such problems
She pushes back the covers and drifts out of bed

INT MAIN HOUSE AT “THE MEADOW” - OFFICE -— MOMENTS LATER

Penny approaches the wall of photographs and trophies The
office is dark lit only by the Virginia moonlight She
touches the ball of yarn with the half-finished scarf her
mother had been knitting It’s in a checkerboard pattern
blue and white

On the table beside the chair is a framed photograph Penny
lifts it and sees a photo of Chris and Penny she looks 13

Penny stands beside the car that contains Jack and their
children she’s smiling broadly

PENNY
This’11 be fun for you Sarah

Their laughter tells Penny the children will be fine Jack
is different all business as he starts the engine

JACK
Make sure Hollis has that Power of
Attorney order The estate’s
vulnerable

PENNY
T’11l stay on him

No kiss no smile from Jack Penny pats the car then waves
goodbye and smiles cheerfully as the car pulls away

KATE
(calling back)
Give Granddaddy a hug for us when
he wakes up

PENNY
I will Be good I love you

As the car disappears onto the main road Penny is left in
quiet isolation It’s as if the farm has become a cemetery

and the grazing horses markers of the graves of what once was
thriving and alive

INT “THE MEADOW” — MAIN BARN - MOMENTS LATER

A barn for race horses and brood mares is a beautiful place
especially when the sun has just lit the damp morning air
Penny appears in the broad doorway and makes her way along
the long row of horse stalls reacquainting herself with a
place and a life she’d largely forgotten She stops at a
stall that holds a beautiful mare whose stall plate tells
her is SomethingRoyal

CARL HATTON
Eddie Who the hell told you to
bring this one out

EDDIE
Well I figured--

CARL HATTON
--you figure nothing Put him back
and bring out that yearling in 18

EDDIE
Yes sir Mister Hatton

Hatton sees Miss Ham and doesn’t mind a bit that she’s heard
his tirade then he notices Penny

CARL HATTON
Who the hell are you

PENNY
I’m Penny Tweedy Penny Chenery

CARL HATTON
Oh Well I’m sorry about your
Mother I got work to do

PENNY
(standing)
Excuse me Eddie hold off for a
minute on that yearling in 18
Could I speak with you Mr Hatton
In private

CARL HATTON
About what

Penny looks at Miss Ham and Eddie who quickly leave

CARL HATTON
I know you and your brother arent
horse people Missy and you’ve had
a loss and all but you don’t come
into a barn and interrupt a
trainer’s work Not if you want to
keep him

Page 16 of 113

PENNY
I understand I just wanted to ask
you about the sale of those brood
mares that my mother stopped a few
weeks ago

CARL HATTON
What about it

PENNY
They were worth twice what we were
going to sell them for I couldn’t
sleep last night so I checked the
books and made some calls this
morning to be sure

CARL HATTON
I don’t own the horses your father
has to sell ‘em

PENNY
But as trainer you’d know their
worth and that they were about to
be sold What I was wondering is
why it had to be my Mother who
stopped the sale and not you

OUTSIDE THE BARN EAVESDROPPING are Miss Ham and Eddie
hanging on every word

INSIDE THE BARN Hatton is looking at Penny as he might watch
a copperhead he just walked up on

CARL HATTON
The old man your father Ask him

PENNY
I’m asking you My father’s been
sick a long time and you’ve been
paid to look out for his interests

CARL HATTON
I do Just cause this place is
going downhill it ain’t my fault

PENNY

The sale was going to be to Old
Dominion Farms I learned this
morning that the owners of Old
Dominion were already talking about
selling our horses at twice the
price they were paying us And you
train for them too don’t you

Page 17 of 113

CARL HATTON
»-Sometimes So what

PENNY
So if you arranged a deal that gave
them four race horses for half
their market value and they paid
you back with an extra share of
everything they made that wouldn’t
just be disloyal It would be
conspiracy to commit a felony

OUTSIDE Miss Ham and Eddie are wide-eyed INSIDE

CARL HATTON
Who the hell do you think you are
Accusing me

PENNY
My husband’s a lawyer and my
father’s Christopher Chenery And
I’m not Missy anything Get your
things and get off my farm

CARL HATTON
I have a contract I’11 sue you

PENNY
If I ever even hear your name again
I’11 see you go to prison

OUTSIDE Miss Ham and Eddie are going crazy in silent
jubilation Carl Hatton stalks by them beet red beaten
Miss Ham and Eddie are stunned as Penny appears they try to
look casual Penny seems distant as if surprised at what
she just did But she’s focused too acting on instinct

PENNY
Miss Ham I’d better look at the
farm’s business calendar and
anything else you think I need to
see Eddie Mr Hatton won’t be
training our horses anymore so
please keep them healthy til we
figure out what to do

don’t know how hard to run ‘em or
how long to rest ’em Mr Hatton
he’s been saying all these horses
would be sold And if you want to

INT ARLINGTON CLUB - MAIN DINING ROOM -— CONTINUOUS

Penny walks purposefully looking for Bull some of the other

and they’ve already heard about Carl Hatton Bull sees Penny
and stands to welcome her as the Receptionist catches up

RECEPTIONIST
I’m sorry she just-—-

PENNY
Would you please tell Mr Hancock
that Penny Tweedy would like a word

Bull waves the receptionist away and pulls out a chair for
Penny
PENNY
Forgive me for disturbing you

BULL
On the contrary it’s my pleasure

A WAITER pours a tumbler of the best bourbon money can buy

PENNY

BULL

selling the horses or keepin’ ‘em

Page 20 of 113

Carl Hatton out the door looks
pretty strong to me

PENNY

Mr Laurin if you could just hear
me out for a few minutes—-

Page 21 of 113

LUCIEN
Mrs Tweedy I’m flattered Bull
told ya to call but I’m tired of
baby-sitting half-ton animals that
are stubborn or stupid or both

PENNY
IT understand that sir but I’m in
a bit of a tight spot Could you
try it for a few months to see how
things go

LUCIEN
Trainers go where they can find a
good horse not to pick up a few
months work

PENNY
We’ve got plenty of good horses

LUCIEN
No you don’t You’ve got one or
two that might be worth the time
And please don’t take this wrong
but you’re a little short on people
who know what theyre doing

PENNY
That’s why I’m talking to you

LUCIEN
Lady youre not hearing me A
trainer gets rich off commissions—-
10 percent off winners 10 on
sales To get a top trainer you
need a top horse Go back to Bull
and see if he’s got any other
ideas

PENNY
But Mr Laurin--— two of my mares
are pregnant by Bold Ruler and he’s
the best stallion in the whole--

The Call To Post” sounds behind him

LUCIEN
Sorry I gotta go

He hangs up And Penny in her father’s office looks up to
see Hollis storming in wearing golf clothes

HOLLIS
You fired our trainer

Page 22 of 113

PENNY
Hollis You didn’t fly home

HOLLIS
I stayed for a meeting and it’s a
good thing I did We need a
trainer in place How could you
fire him

PENNY
He was worse than incompetent He
was dishonest He had to go

Hollis tries to rub away a headache--and reality

HOLLIS
I don’t know any more about horses
than you do But I know we need a
trainer to keep the horses fit
enough to unload them

PENNY
I’m working on it Hollis Ive
got a line on one recommended by
Bull Hancock

HOLLIS
Well at least Bull Hancock knows
what he’s doing and our father
trusted him The estate tax will
kill us Penny-- do you realize
that When Dad dies we’re out of
time and it’s a fire sale

Penny is silent trying not to show her anger in being
lectured on what she already knows

HOLLIS
Look I know this is a strain for
you being away from home Just

find a nurse for Dad and you can
et back to Jack and the kids I
gotta go

And he’s off again leaving Penny with the whole mess

Penny sets down three of her father’s handwritten journals
The top one is titled Hasty Matelda She opens it and the

JACK
She has a boyfriend When are you
coming back

PENNY
Soon I just want to tell you
about the coin toss

The kids are playing behind him yelling

JACK
What Kids quiet Coin toss

PENNY
Stallions cost more than mares
they’re more glamorous but since a
great horse comes from the mare as
much as the stallion Daddy
invested in mares That’s the
first smart thing he does The
second is he makes a deal with
Ogden Phipps

JACK
Phipps Richest man in America

PENNY
Instead of paying a stud fee Daddy
makes a deal to breed Phipps’ best
stallion to our best two mares
When the mares are near term they
flip a coin to choose who gets
which foal The coin flip’s in two
weeks

JACK
So what I don’t have any idea
which horse to choose

For only a moment it registers with Penny that Jack assumes
she wants him to make a decision rather than support hers

Page 25 of 113
PENNY
I’ve been into the breeding books

The sire Bold Ruler was fast but
couldn’t last over distances The

dams are Hasty Matelda and

SomethingRoyal Hasty Matelda had
lots of speed so she’s the obvious

choice But SomethingRoyal’s

grandsire was Princequillo He had

great stamina and-—-

That boy’s a whopper

They stare at the COLT a miracle of birth and life

Our music rises (we will have a grand SECRETARIAT theme) into
A MONTAGE of Penny’s life and the colt’s growth intertwined

--The colt in a dew-soaked field suckling from
SomethingRoyal as Penny watches

--Penny at home in Denver caring for her own children
feeding them helping them with homework silently cringing
as Jack ridicules Kate’s hippie attire Penny soothes Kate by
braiding her hair and weaving in a flower Kate loves it

--Penny back in Virginia touches the growing mane of the
growing colt and he surprises Penny and Eddie by nuzzling
his head against Penny’s chest She smiles moved

--Penny in an airplane seat going through ledgers as she
flies home DISSOLVE THROUGH to Penny at home doing dishes
picking up her children’s clothes laughing with them as they
play after dinner and the girls talk on the phone Penny
doing laundry then sitting at her desk late into the night
in her office at home The MONTAGE ENDS as Jack walks in
rumpled and sleepless in his pajamas Penny looks up from her
ledgers and glances at the clock it’s past midnight

Page 31 of 113

PENNY
I’m almost done

JACK
How long do you think you can live
two lives at once

PENNY
The colts are looking good and the
new trainer’s working hard we’ve
cut expenses were breaking even

She feels good about this Jack doesn’t

JACK
I thought the point was to sell the
farm not to break even

She glances at a picture on the desk she and Jack young
lovers in college happy optimistic Beside it is a picture
of the growing red colt

PENNY
When I went off to college I felt
like that colt Full of promise
and adventure Like I could make
something work Now I want to see
him run I just want to see him
run

Jack sighs and without another word he leaves her Now
Penny feels no hurry to get to bed

What neither she nor Jack knows is that DOWN THE HALLWAY
Kate has been watching and hearing everything Kate closes
the door to her room switches on the light of her own
desk and starts doing her homework

Penny alone at her desk looks at the picture of the red
colt Rising in the background the sound of THUNDERING

him with affection as Jimmy walks him away

The dull expression on Christopher Chenery’s face flickers
just a bit He may not remember much but he knows a good
looking horse when he sees one

He struggles to stand and succeeds Penny takes his hand as
he uses the other to reach for the horse and pet his nose
And then Penny calmly explains hoping that a part of him

EXT SARATOGA — WINNER’S CIRCLE — A FEW MINUTES LATER

And now the WINNER’S PHOTOGRAPH is being taken Penny and
the entire team (Lucien Ronnie Miss Ham Eddie) surrounding
the victorious horse as the flashbulbs pop FROM PENNY’S
Pov it’s all harsh light and noise Lucien is happy he
notices Ronnie’s silks are covered in dirt

LUCIEN
You look like you finished last

RONNIE
I was there long enough

Secretariat full of pride and the fire of victory is
actually turning his head toward each photographer Nack and
Beyer are among the reporters

BEYER
Is it just me or is that horse
posing
NACK
What are you talking about Horses
don’ t-—-

He stops scribbling as he sees Snap Pose Snap Pose
Nack loves it and starts scribbling again furiously

NACK
(mumbling as he writes)
“the owner hates attention the
horse loves it”

And then Secretariat does something even more surprising
this dominating beast of a racehorse fresh from humiliating
a herd of hot-blooded rivals turns his huge filthy head and
places it like a baby against Penny’s chest She cradles him
with exquisite tenderness the photographers go crazy Penny
closes her eyes shutting them out

But as the reporters leave and the grooms lead Secretariat
away Penny and her group watch with surging excitement

LUCIEN
He knocked those other horses out
of the way like they were sparrows
I never saw a two-year-old do that

PENNY
You see the way he struts He
looks at the competition like “Is
this all you’ve got”

I think he walks like like a
woman with big boobs

They all gawk at herhowl with laughter We launch into-——

MONTAGE OF VICTORIES Secretariat blasts past one finish
line after another (always starting dead last) and Penny’s
back in the winner’s circle receiving a different set of
flowers every time and each time Secretariat poses then
nuzzles Penny and ruins another new dress Ronnie’s white
silks are covered in mud after every victory

EXT BELMONT PARK -— STABLES - LATE AFTERNOON

Penny walks alongside Secretariat holding one of the leads
along with Eddie as the horse heads back to the barn Beyer
and Nack walk with her she’s stiff struggling to be natural
with two of the best reporters in all of racing

BEYER
Seven wins in four months Theres
talk he could be Horse of the Year

PENNY
Well He’s done everything
weve asked of him

BEYER
But the sons of Bold Ruler have all
faded as 3-year-olds And the

Triple Crown races are much longer

Penny smiles volunteering nothing

BEYER
I mean it’s extremely rare for a 2-
year-old to be considered for Horse
of the Year but they’re still big
kids at that age they haven’t
proven their full potential

PENNY
Thats true

Page 49 of 113
Iturned my screenplay inte a MP3
and Its MAKING MONEY mar’s THE FACT Lack

NACK
What’ve you learned about the
horse

Its easier for her to talk about the horse she softens

PENNY
---He loves to run Likes to come
from behind--nerve wracking for me
but his fans love it And he’s
a ham Youve seen him show off

NACK
You really think he knows what he’s
doing

Secretariat looks directly at him it’s spooky

NACK
Don’t look at me--Beyer’s the one
who says you can’t run distances

They laugh but Beyer presses the point to Penny

BEYER
You do acknowledge the issue
right That speed and endurance
don’t go togeth--

A splattering sound like a hose squirting on concrete
interrupts Beyer looks at his shoes then at the horse

BEYER

No way

Nack laughs and starts scribbling again loving this

INT HOSPITAL ROOM — NIGHT

Penny is alone at her father’s bedside He’s comatose
monitors beeping a ventilator softly sucking Penny kneels
beside himj maybe she’s praying or maybe the weight of life
has bent her over She lifts her head looks at her father
strokes his limp gray hair

PENNY
I don’t think weve left much
unsaid Daddy I always knew where
you stood And I’m grateful for
the way you showed me what it was
to stand up in the world and live
the way you believe

Page 51 of 113

Tears choke her for a moment but Penny Chenery won’t let
tears stop her

PENNY
The big red colt won Horse of the
Year Daddy I think he can go all
the way If he does I hope you
can see it

She kisses his head and then realizes the heart monitors
have ceased to beep Penny lowers her head beside her
father’s and weeps

INT THE MEADOW - OFFICE - NIGHT

Penny is sitting alone at her father’s desk trying to
collect her strength she looks up to see Jack entering
Then Hollis walks in just behind him Penny stands and hugs
them both

Miss Ham has been at her desk weeping with her own grief
she moves to the door between her office and Pennys closing
it so they all can have privacy

PENNY
I hadn’t had a chance to call
How’d you get here so fast

JACK
I was already on my way

PENNY
Are-- Are the children all right

JACK
Yes sure they’re great Or as
great as they can be without their
mother around

He quickly softens his words as if this is all about taking
care of Penny and the children

JACK
This is a terrible time Penny
and we’re all here for you I just

hope you’1l come home now
Penny looks from Jack to Hollis to Jack

PENNY
And you were already coming here to
tell me that--before you heard
about Daddy

Page 52 of 113
JACK
Our children need a full-time
mother And I want a full-time
wife When your horse people call
the house they don’t ask for Mrs
Tweedy they ask for Miz Chenery
Is that who you’ve become

PENNY
So you two have teamed up

HOLLIS
It’s family business And last
time I checked Jack and your
children were still part of the
family

PENNY
Hollis you’re my brother and I
love you But if you presume to
judge my fitness as a wife or
mother I’11 count you a stranger
for the rest of my life

JACK
Penny Hollis is only trying to
talk sense

PENNY
Sense My father just died and
you want to talk sense

JACK
Your anger is exactly why we need
this intervention

HOLLIS
We’re in a crisis Penny What
better time is there to talk sense

The word makes Penny’s eyes flame Jack tries to sound
reasonable

JACK
Hollis asked me to study the tax
issues that would arise immediately
upon your father’s death and now
they’ve hit us At the current
value of his estate the
inheritance tax will be at least
six million

Page 53 of 113
HOLLIS
Six millions dollars Penny And
neither of us has a fraction of
that money

PENNY
So we sell the mares and yearlings

HOLLIS
I had an appraisal done and that
wont get us close to what we need
»»»But there is another option

PENNY
I’m not selling him

Hollis looks at Jack for help

JACK
Due to his outstanding two year old
season if he were sold today
Secretariat would bring a price of
seven million dollars Enough to
cover the tax bill by himself

(beat)

Now I‘m assuming the plan was to
run him in the Triple Crown races
But if he were to lose just one of
those three races his value would
drop to two million With no way
to recover it

HOLLIS
So we sell the horse We’1l talk
about the farm later

PENNY
Hollis you try to sell that horse-—

HOLLIS
You just heard how much money we
need

JACK
Please let’s settle down

HOLLIS
Look we all respect what you did
but we’re out of time Business
hasn’t been great for me lately
The farm and the horses they’re
our father’s legacy We play this
wrong it could amount to nothing

HOLLIS (contd)
s time we get smart Put the

money into some good safe stocks

PENNY

Our father came from nothing You
know the story--his best Christmas
was when he got a tangerine He
made every penny himself And his
legacy to me isn’t money it’s the
will to win if you can and live
with it if you don’t And TI will
not dishonor him or myself by
quitting now

If

HOLLIS
I have to challenge you in

court I will And my lawyer tells

me

Jack can’t lo

I’m likely to prevail

ok Penny in the eye She moves to the door

PENNY

Miss Ham Would you step in here a
moment please

Miss Ham ente

rs with a clear sense of the situation

PENNY

Please tell Hollis and Jack about
the provision Daddy left you

MISS HAM

Last year Mr Chenery had me
witness him signing a provision
that while both of you are
beneficiaries dispersal of the
farm would be left to Hollis
Decisions regarding the horses
would be left to Penny

HOLLIS

Last year he already had dementia

He
it

MISS HAM
was of sound mind when he signed
I’d swear to it In court
PENNY

Thank you Miss Ham

Miss Ham wit
them alone

h the hint of a sad but steely smile leaves

Hollis is beaten for now

Page 55 of 113
He leaves

HOLLIS

Well Penny you better find six

million dollars before you race him

again And if he loses one
those races You won’t see
None of us will

PENNY
Then I’11 live with it

HOLLIS
Why Why do you need to
past that no longer exists

For a

Our

father was a great man but we

can’t bring him back

PENNY

No we can’t And this isn’t about

going back it’s about life being

ahead of you And you run at it
like a racehorse as fast and as

far as you can because you never

know how much life is there
you run

HOLLIS
Okay Penny Fair enough

unless

you stumble and fall you don’t
just make us fools you make us

beggars

Now only Jack and Penny remain

PENNY

I always thought Miz Chenery and

Mrs Tweedy were the same person

Now Miz Chenery wonders why Mr

Tweedy believes he has to join my

brother in an intervention

Jack walks out leaving Penny alone again

He’s the only one she can talk to right now She rubs his
nose and the horse dips his head to her as if he understands
her grief and that she has bet everything placed all her
hopes on him (NOTE We will sometimes use POV’s of the
horse to see the world and experience the story from his
eyes) Eddie stands back watching them both

EDDIE

Hancock Ma‘ am

PENNY
What about him

EDDIE
Came home from your father’s
funeral and fell dead

Another dagger into Penny’s soul she doesn’t know how much
more she can take Both Eddie and Red seem to sense this

EDDIE
I can’t speak for the ways of God
Ma’am But your Daddy and Mr
Bull they lifted each other up
The way you lift me up And lift
Red up Everything living lives
from its heart I wish I could
give you something that would lift
yours up

PENNY
You just did Eddie Thank you

He leaves her alone Just Penny and Big Red

She looks at him he looks back His eyes are huge and
bottomless like windows into eternity

And there’s no way in the world she’s going to give up on
him or on herself

proposition for you Seth I want
to sell Secretariat’s breeding
rights

SETH

I’ve got a little more experience--

PENNY
Before he retires I want to
syndicate his breeding rights now

SETH
All due respect ma’am but it
doesn’t work that way

PENNY
It’s never been done but that
doesn’t mean it can’t work We
offer 32 shareholders exclusive
breeding rights We call it “a
select opportunity”

SETH HANCOCK
My father would’ve loved that
phrase How much per

PENNY
Two-hundred-thousand

SETH HANCOCK

ever paid for a breeding share A
lot more

PENNY
That makes it exciting Seth And
horse racing’s all about
excitement

She stops and leans against the fence Giving him time

SETH HANCOCK
He’s been a great colt but he’s
completely untried as a three-year-—
old and the sons of Bold Ruler
have never shown stamina

Phipps thought when he could’ve
chosen my colt

called me

to Lucien in French)
You sure you want to talk about
this now

UCIEN (IN FRENCH)
When else should we talk about it
Phe race is in three weeks

RONNIE (IN FRENCH)
Let her celebrate There’s no
hurry to

Page 94 of 113

PENNY (IN ENGLISH)
I know the race is in three weeks
But we need to make a decision now

Lucien glances at Ronnie then asks Penny

LUCIEN
So all this time you understood

PENNY

Oui
»-they all smile Lucien has grown to really like her

LUCIEN
So in the last twenty five years
seven horses have won the Derby and
the Preakness but nobody’s won the
Triple Crown That’s because of
the Belmont Mile and a half the
longest race these horses will ever
run Red won the Derby and the
Preakness in record time coming
from behind in both You gotta
figure he knows he’11 burn out if
he goes too fast and too early

PENNY
So what do we do

LUCIEN
Conventional wisdom is to rest him
Let him recover from the last two
and store up energy for the
Belmont

PENNY
I never believed conventional
wisdom is any such thing

LUCIEN
Then I say we work him Run him
hard Harder and faster than ever

Penny knows this decision could cost everything Or win it

LUCIEN
Miz Chenery in all my years of
training horses I’ve never seen
one with his kind of appetite for
running It’s like he can’t get
enough I work him one day he
runs faster the next

LUCIEN (contd)

this race and there’s a chance we
could be draining every drop of gas
out of his tank But I don’t think

magically inherited both This

intuition only goes so far
