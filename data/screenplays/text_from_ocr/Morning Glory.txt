someone GROAN then slap the clock quiet A beat

perched precariously on a bookcase It’s an old model
practically has a hanger for an antenna

Now the figure in bed sits up -- BECKY FULLER 30s

the last one catches her attention

GREENIE stops and looks too They watch as

ON THE TV -- We see a grainy black and white archive shot
from the 70’s of a young REPORTER in front of Three Mile
Island We hear the pompous network VOICEOVER

VOICEOVER
He’s the anchor you’ve trusted for
almost two decades

from the 1977 New York City blackout

VOICEOVER (CONTD)
He circled the globe to get YOU the
story you needed

We see the same REPORTER in Afghanistan in the 80’s followed
closely by the camera We see flashes of enemy fire up ahead

REPORTER

Another flash He keeps running towards the action

VOICEOVER
Hes covered every major story
that’s touched our nation

Music swells over a series of dissolves as the REPORTER
becomes recognizable as MIKE POMEROY From the site of a
plane crash at the Oliver North trial in Desert Storm

VOICEOVER (CONTD)
And he was there for us when we
were most in need of comfort -—- the
only anchor who went to Ground Zero
to show YOU what was happening

MIKE on 911 at Ground Zero talking to a FIREFIGHTER who is
covered with grime

VOICEOVER (CONTD)
Join us next week for a look back
at the life and times of Mike

BECKY looks at her dumbfounded Just then DYLAN walks in
with his father DONNIE

And although they’re completely different they look alike -
DONNIE looks like what DYLAN would look like if he were
twenty years older a mechanic and a biker

DYLAN
»-many people believe baseball
began as a game called rounders in
pre-Civil-War America Some other
early precursors to baseball were
stoolball poison ball and
“town ball” Oh hey Mom

INT LECTURE HALL -- COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - DAY

We see a panel of TV PRODUCERS on a dais -- the event is
moderated by a hip long-haired PROFESSOR

PROFESSOR
«ss representing the local morning
news shows we have Becky Fuller of
WPGH
(polite applause)
Next we have Adam Green executive
producer of The Morning Show

CAMERA finds GREENIE BECKY tries hard not to look at him

GREENTE
You can call me Greenie

PROFESSOR
Morning shows can be the cash cows
for their news divisions The
Morning Show in fact is the
single most profitable program in
the history of television Every
evening news rating point is worth
one million -- in morning news it
can be 10 million

‘He turns to the panel

PROFESSOR (CONTD)
Becky lets start with you what
do you think are the requirements
for working in morning news

BECKY

Well you’ll be covering an amazing
range of topics from hard news on
down to 8 ways to make spaghetti
squash so you have to be a very
curious person--

PROFESSOR
Adam

GREENIE
Well I agree with some of what
Becky said but I do think the
field has changed since she was
working here in New York

BECKY
‘Yes that’s right I’m a relic In
a year everything I knew about
national news is out the window

The audience laughs BECKY doesn’t

GREENIE
I didn’t say that What I meant
was it’s an evolving business You
really have to be in the thick of
jt to track its evolution

BECKY watches GREENIE trying to plaster a smile on her face

AFTER THE PANEL

The PANELISTS mingle with the crowd BECKY leoks at GREENIE
in the center of a throng of admirers Suddenly she hears a
voice behind her

VOICE im
Hes the most successful EP in The
Morning Shows history Theyve
never been so far out

BECKY turns Sees ROGER Sleek and expensive-looking as ever

BECKY
Good for him Brilliant guy

BECKY shrugs Picks up a carrot stick

BECKY (CONTD)
You come down here to learn about
the news

ROGER
Come on Be nice Doesn’t it make
you feel better that I got
shitcanned last month Now we have
something in common

BECKY
Actually we don’t You got thrown
out in a run-of-the-mill corporate
coup You still have your
reputation -- such as it is Mine
was ruined I’m the 2 on the 3
show in Providence I’m sleeping in
my mother’s basement and--
ROGER
(very quickly)
--and I just closed the deal to be
the head of network news for ABS
and we need a new EP for Daybreak

She stares amazed

ROGER (CONTD)
Just thought Id see if you have
any interest in redeeming yourself
fixing that god-awful show and
maybe kicking Greenie’s Ivy League
ass at the same time

BECKY
You want me to run Daybreak

ROGER
Unless Rhode Island is just too
riveting

BECKY cant help it -- a leap of joy hits her

BECKY
Roger I never thought--

ROGER
Thought so Let’s have lunch
Hammer out a contract

He starts to walk away

BECKY
No-

‘He turns Excuse me

BECKY (CONTD)
The show needs a complete overhaul
It’s not even cleared by some
affiliates I don’t even know why
they keep it on the air They could
beat it with soap operas and game
shows--

ROGER
--but we don’t have a strong news
division so we need the show and--

BECKY
-and you desperately need a co-
anchor

(MORB)
She looks

BECKY (CONTD)
Paul McVee is a houseplant and he’s
there because that’s what Colleen
Peck wants -- a backup singer And
sadly enough she’s the face of ABS
News You can’t piss her off or
shell quit

ROGER
--I agree with you And because I’m
a genius I persuaded Colleen to
accept a new anchor

BECKY
How did-you do that

ROGER
I threatened to cut her reporting
budget in half and have her ancher
the show from Daytona during spring
break And so she approved him

BECKY
Him

ROGER
She’1l only approve one person And
if you can convince him to do it
the show is yours

at him Oh no

ROGER (CONTD)
Man’s a legend

BECKY
Jesus Roger

ROGER
Look I’ve always felt bad about
what happened Youre very
talented and you got stuck I
still believe in you but you’re
damaged goods and you know it

And she looks at him knowing he’s right but

Look I’ve already got a good job--
(off his look)
--not exactly what I wanted but

BECKY (CONTD)

Only thing youve ever been is a
journalist You started out writing
for your elementary school paper --
the Bluffton Bee -- when you were
nine It’s all you‘ve ever done

believe for a second that you dont
miss it News breaks and it kills
you that you’re not out there

MIKE

morning shows don’t Do News

her

BECKY
Goddammit Mike Yes they do Will
I have to make compromises run
some tabloid stories teach people
how to bake -- not fry -their
chicken Hell yeah But everyone
makes compromises-—

MIKE
Wow this is inspiring

BECKY

--network television is owned by
corporations they need a bottom
line and if we get them enough
eyeballs then we get to do stories
we care about And -- and--

(can’t stop herself)
And besides all that I I need
you

He looks at her surprised She’s pretty surprised at
herself come to think of it

BECKY (CONTD)

- Youre Mike Pomeroy The only man
on television who’s ever had your
approval numbers is Fonzie You
want to stay out here and think
about the good old days when news
was king Great But you and I both
know the truth -- you quit too

He wavers Maybe for a second But she sees it
BECKY (CONTD)

COLLEEN

COLLEEN recoils a bit surprised And a bit amused

COLLEEN
Thats not true I was simply
looking for someone who could
really raise the bar around here

COLLEEN shrugs But its hard to hide her smile

COLLEEN
And it doesn’t matter now does At

BECKY neds COLLEEN walks away BECKY sighs
That’s when the elevator opens And MIKE POMEROY steps out

MIKE

I just happened to be in the
neighborhood and since you made the
offer face to face I thought If

get excited

BECKY
(excited)
I’m not excited

MIKE
I’ve won eight Peabodies a
Pulitzer I‘ve been shot through
co the forearm in Bosnia Forty
LH stitches

BECKY
Yeah I get it You can’t take a
job in morning television because
it would undermine everything
youve accomplished your very
sense of who you are morally
Especially not at this show

MIKE
Exactly

BECKY
And if you compromise that you’d
be compromising your legacy And
there’s no way you’d do that

MIKE

Yes that’s it
A beat then very quickly

BECKY

She stops herself aware she’s going on too long
BECKY (CONTD)

--and anyway what are you doing in

NICK
--the story I did on the call
centers in Alaska the piece on gay
marriage the interview I scored
with the embattled United Nations
security chief--

BECKY

NICK
You kill them or you bigfoot them

anchoring from overseas hotspots

BECKY
--you mean the piece about a
single mother who works the call
center all night so she can be with
her developmentally disabled child
all day Or about how any idiot
with a butane lighter and a
newspaper can take out the UN

On NICK very surprised

“You watched them

BECKY

it’s a pretty big space people are clumped in corners with
the other execs from their own network

The first person they bump into is KEN BARKER

BECKY
Oh hey Ken

And for some reason he just blows right past her BECKY
shrugs -- he must net have heard her

JEFF goes to get BECKY a drink COLLEEN who’s never looked
more beautiful sweeps over to BECKY

COLLEEN
This is unbelievable I’ve never
been to one of these things without
having to go in the bathroom and
hyperventilate with shame

BECKY laughs

- COLLEEN (CONTD)
I just want to thank you I know I
was skeptical when you came to
the show but thanks Becky
(notices)”
Oh look my agent actually wants to

She sweeps away BECKY laughs

ROGER
The network’s never had anyone do
quite so well with Daybreak
JEFF
Not surprised
(to BECKY)

BECKY

He walks away ROGER quickly excuses himself BECKY wrinkles
her brow at how quickly he dumped her shrugs it off

A WAITER walks by with a plate of cheese puffs BECKY takes
one and as the WAITER walks away he reveals
GREENIE standing there

GREENIE
Well look at you

GREENIE (CONTD)

COLLEEN sweeps BECKY up in a hug BECKY chats with an
excited AVA BECKY looks at ROGER who looks oddly
subdued JODI RAMIREZ comes over to congratulate her
LENNY offers her aMaalox BECKY sees KEN BARKER moving

INT BECKYS APARTMENT -- NIGHT

DYLAN and DONNIE are playing chess DONNIE stares at the
board like a caveman brain hurting

BECKY (0S)
Um Dylan what did Ken Barker’s
son say to you exactly

INT CIPRIANI -- NIGHT
We hear DYLANS voice as BECKY looks around the room
DYLAN (0S)
I don’t know It was something
about his Dad
She watches KEN BARKER talking to ROGER
DYLAN (CONTD)
and how he wanted to get more
hours on the air
ROGER and KEN shake hands
DYLAN (CONTD)
and he figured out how to do it”
or something I don’t know

And suddenly GREENIE joins KEN and ROGER And soon theyre
Locked in what looks to be an intense huddle

BECKY
Okay Thanks honey Say goodnight
- to Donnie
And for some reason BECKYS heart is pounding
ON THE FLOOR

We see BECKY stalk across the floor She corners ROGER who
has moved to the bar

BECKY (CONTD)
Need to talk to you--

BECKY pulls ROGER to the side

BECKY (CONTD)
What is it

ROGER
I’m sorry what

She narrows her eyes

BECKY
It’s Barker Youre going into
business with him

ROGER
(sighs)
iim not
BECKY
(guessing)
He set up a prime time show

“He shakes his head She thinks No They wouldnt

BECKY (CONTD)
Theyre giving him the morning
They’re cancelling our show

And ROGER looks down for a moment less than utterly”

And she realizes She wells up with frustration

BECKY (CONTD)
For God’s sake Roger why Were
doing so well--

ROGER

-and you’re running a very
expensive show Youve never won a
sweeps -- hell Daybreak’s never
won a week Mike and Colleen are
the highest priced talent out
there youre paying out McVee’s
contract plus Mike squeezed you

- for the on-location anchoring and
the overseas reports--

BECKY
--but the ratings-—-

ROGER
--and Batkers programming costs
nothing They can take a 15 percent
ratings dip and still be wildly
profitable

BECKY
So why did they -- even bother
hiring me Or Mike

ROGER
They had to wait for Barker’s
exclusive deal with-the GBC to end
And also because he was pretty
confident you might do a good job
of getting some of the affiliates
to pick our morning programming
Which you did

BECKY
He Who

crisp
ROGER
Your new boss

and she follows his sightline She starts to panic

BECKY
Greenie is taking your job

ROGER
Oh no He’s going to be my boss
(off her look)
Run the whole network

She stares at him the air having left her body

ROGER (CONTD)

They couldnt give him the TMS slot
at GBC cf course but Greenie knew’
Barker wanted morning time so he
connected him with the chairman of
ABS Just informally As a favor
To show how serious he was about
coming here-- -

BECKY -
- --and the first thing he’s going to
do is cancel a news show

She looks down at the party stunned Sees MIKE being
congratulated Reels

ROGER

(quietly)
Theyre coming for us all First it
will be the evening news --they’re
loss leaders but the news costs
money -- anchors reporters
bureaus -- and it’s not profitable
enough And so one day they will
come for us too and news will be
like sports outsourced to cable

BECKY
Daybreak deserves a shot My people
deserve a shot

ROGER
You have one
(off her look)
I managed to get you an out
(beat)
The affiliates won’t let them
cancel Daybreak if
BECKY
-if it’s

ROGER
if it’s number one If you can
do that it blows the Barker deal

BECKY
How how did you get that in
there In the deal

ROGER

It was easy

(beat)
Becky there’s not a person on this
planet who thinks you can make the
show 1

(nods his head sadly)
Not even me

And she gathers herself

BECKY
I have to go

- ROGER -
What are you going to do

She walks away
INT DINER - NIGHT

BECKY (CONTD)
You know why people want to win

my life I’m almost there and now
I understand why people devote
their lives to being 1 Because

rewarded for That’s what Greenie
understood way before I did

MIKE

MIKE

Oh come on Mike--

MIKE

You were right after I retired I

BECKY just looks at him astonished

MIKE (CONTD)
You came down to see me And you
were smart and different and you
kicked my ass And I believed in
you And now

want to do either but

BECKY

for the people who work for me --

MIKE
