man Unfortunately not all my people are
as enlightened Ask them What is civil
rights they dont know Theyre not as
open to change from the way things are
done and whos doing it But I can talk
to them so there wont be any
misunderstanding Thats what I mean by
peace of mind

Frank knows in truth hes not being given any choice in
this matter Still maybe its not so bad

FRANK
You pay what a kilo now 75 80 Id
consider 50 And I can get you as much
as you want
Tosca slips on his best poker face Fifty thousand a kilo
would be an extraordinary coup for him

INT STAIRWELL - FLOORS - SOUTH TOWER - DAY

Floor by floor they work their way up the tower like
commandos the squalor and decay and hopelessness somehow
intensifying the higher up they go

Reaching the 17th floor they listen to a strange sound
before easing the fire door open enough to see a kid on a
Big Wheels pedalling straight at them He passes and the
sound fades

INT 17TH FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY

Half the apartment doors are gone TVs and radios echo
voices argue infants wail The detectives come around a
corner and see at the end of it a couple of guys with a
sawed-off shotguns sitting outside a closed door

They step back Consider one other Spearman volunteers
with a nod continues on alone as the others wait He walks
up to the guys with the guns

SPEARMAN
I got to talk to Teddy

GUY WITH GUN
Get the fuck out of here

SPEARMAN
What the fuck is that I got business
with Teddy and its none of your fuckin
business except to knock on the fuckin
door and get him

As the guy stands pumping the shotgun Spearman yanks it
hard against his throat like a garrote forcing him to the
floor The shotgun explodes showering plaster and pellets
Jones and Abruzzo are instantly all over the other guy as
Richie swings the sledgehammer into the door -

INT APARTMENT THE PROJECTS - CONTINUOUS

The door splinters - the room already in chaos - Teddy
panicked runs for the bedroom - the detectives crash in
yelling at the girls to get down - a shot from somewhere
inside wings Abruzzo - Jones and Spearman firing back -
crawling across the floor like an infantrymen -

Richie comes into the darkened bedroom leading with his
pistol But Teddys gone He sees a tapestry of a tiger on
a wall Pulls at it finds a big hole knocked into another
dark apartment climbs through sees an open door -

INT THE PROJECTS BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

As Richie rushes out to the hallway he can hear footfalls
echoing in the stairwell He starts down taking the stairs
five at a time chases Teddy down two flights -

Teddy yanks open a door runs down a corridor bangs into

an apartment Richie reaches the apartment just as Teddy is
goes out onto an exterior balcony -

Richie continues along the interior corridor running
parallel to Teddy on the balcony who trips over some debris
and garbage looking over his shoulder for Richie -

Richie cuts through another apartment to head him off but

the door to the balcony is nailed shut So are the windows
Richie looks around grabs a small portable television and
just as Teddy runs past hurls it through a window at him

hitting him in the head

He falls hard dazed Richie hurries through the broken
window Teddy comes to and fights back until Richie breaks
his femur with his bare hands Teddy howls in excruciating
pain -

in the mirror Under the fluorescent lights - maybe under

on it and tries to gather himself

INT COURTROOM - DAY

At the prosecutors table Richie steals glances at the
battery of expensive attorneys over at the defense table

The courtroom doors swing open and Richie sees Frank Lucas
in a tailored suit escorted in without cuffs by an amiable-
looking federal marshal

As Frank moves through the gallery Richie sees its full of
the gangsters friends many of them celebrities who smile
and greet and fawn as if the Pope has arrived

Richie has evidence tables covered with cash weapons
stocks bonds property deeds pictures of Franks holdings
heroin in blue cellophane

Frank has celebrities community leaders Joe Louis himself
who will testify to Franks benevolent character The Champ
hugs the heroin trafficker warmly in front of everyone and
Richie wonders if he should just give up now
Richie sees it in slow motion the hands reaching out to
Frank the pats on his back lipsticked mouths of beautiful
women offering kisses and words of encouragement his old
mother giving him a hug

He watches Franks head turn slowly his eyes passing his
phalanx of attorneys the jury finally settling on Richie
in his cheap suit seated at the prosecutors table

Franks eyes smile as they regard Richie and seem to ask
Can you see this - can you see what youre up against - can
you see how insignificant you are

Reaching the end of the welcoming line finally Frank
brushes by Richie and disappears from view somewhere within
the protective husk of his multi-million-dollar legal team
JUDGE

Richie slowly lifts himself from his chair steps forward
turns to look at the jury thats studying him finally finds
his voice

RICHIE
