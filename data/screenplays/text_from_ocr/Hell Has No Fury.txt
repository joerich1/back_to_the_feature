After your yearly tribute is paid

MAY 8 1945

Kids doing homework Donna Marie cooking From outside
shouting-- loud NOISES FIRECRACKERS AUTO HORNS The kids

rush to a window looking out to see

Crowds cheering dancing in the street men and women
kissing people drinking champagne

Germany has SURRENDERED

The Brunelli family joins the celebration A WOMAN with an
operatic voice starts singing America The Beautiful People
join in including the Brunelli family They know the lyrics
Smiling and proud they sing at the top of their lungs

In a cafe a WHITE HAIRED MAN dressed in white sips espresso
his eyes follow Donna Marie and her kids as they move through
the crowd He removes his cigarette from its holder snuffs
it out grabs his walking stick and hurries to a phone booth

He sits closes the door and dials a number We can’t hear
what he is saying At times he looks back at Donna Marie and
her family-- As if confirming what he is saying

INT RUN DOWN APARTMENT - HELL’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Donna Marie stands NAKED in a galvanized tub by the window
The outside NEON bathes her body in RED Over this we
HEAR

DON ENZO (VO)
Hail Mary full of Grace

She squeezes the sponge Water cascades over her breasts

trailing down her body her skin glowing with a RED luster

DON ENZO (VO)
Our Lord is with thee Blessed art
thou among women

INT A CATHEDRAL IN PALERMO SICILY

DON ENZO (CONTD)
And blessed is the fruit of thy
womb Jesus

JOVANI(20s) a jagged SCAR across his cheek appears just
behind Ferrante The Don pauses his Rosary Jovani bends to
whisper in his ear After a beat Enzo nods

DON ENZO (CONTD)
Send Imbasiano

JOVANI
Don Enzo Why risk another son
Allow me to take care of this

A bone-chilling look from Enzo Jovani bows his head backs
away Enzo continues with his Rosary fingering his beads

BACK TO DONNA MARIE

Standing in the tub her naked body backlit by red neon
drying her self with a towel ENZO’S VOICE CONTINUES

DON ENZO (VO)

us sinners now and at the hour of
our death

TWO WEEKS LATER

FIREWORKS Orange and gold “Mums” sky-bursting LIGHTING up
the night sky-- celebrating THE FESTIVAL OF THE DEAD

EXT HELL’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

A macabre SKELETON on six-foot stilts lumbers forward A
parade of demons ghosts skulls and skeletons carrying
TORCHES wearing body length paper-mache masks all dancing
their way around a PLAZA

21 Donna Marie and her children carrying groceries weave
through the celebrants and then enter their dilapidated
building A figure across the street steps into the light

The White-Haired man watching them
INSIDE THE APARTMENT BUILDING

A flashlight beam dances up the stairs Sophia flashlight in
hand goes up the second floor followed by the family She
trips falls drops her flashlight It rolls to a stop The
beam fixed on a pair of BLACK SHOES

Sophia picks up the flashlight steers the beam up a pair of
pants to a fist holding an automatic by his leg The beam
continues up to a face not even a mother could love

Eyes black as Satan with an eagle’s beak for a nose
IMBASIANO smiles-- flashing a mouth full of gold teeth
Sophia SCREAMS

Instantly Donna Marie leaps on him clawing at his face
Frankie and Franny grab his gun arm The gun goes off kicks
plaster from the ceiling July jumps on his back wrapping his
arms tightly around his neck his legs around his body

Franny bites his gun hand The gun falls to the floor Donna
Marie gouges at his eyes with her nails Imbasiano spins like
a snorting buffalo-- shakes Frankie and Franny off sends
Donna Marie flying

He reaches behind grabs July by the hair and throws him
over his shoulder Frankie on his knees grabs the ice pick
by the ice-box raises it over his head and with all his
force-- stabs the ice pick through Imbasiano’s foot

Pinning it to the floor

IMBASIANO
EEEEEAAOW

He stoops over to grab the ice-pick-- July pulls the highboy
over crashing it down on top of him Imbasiano drops to one
knee Donna Marie swings a chair with all her strength
crashing it over his head He topples backwards Unconscious
His foot nailed to the floor

The family panting from fear and exertion stare at him A
long beat Finally

FRANNY
Is he dead

JULY
He’s not breathing

FRANKIE
I think he’s dead

Donna Marie bends over feels his throat for a pulse

DONNA MARIE
I don’t feel a--

Massive hands suddenly grab her throat Franny screams July
struggles to pull the assassin’s hands from his mother’s
throat Frankie grabs the ice-box rope loops it around
Imbasiano’s neck and pulls tight

Imbasiano lets go of her throat to work his fingers under the
rope July Franny Donna Marie adrenalin surging sprawl
across his upper torso forcing him backwards between
Frankie’s legs

DONNA MARIE (CONT’D)
Pull harder Frankie

FRANKIE
I’m trying mama

Imbasiano’s eyes bulge his tongue protrudes His heels rap a
staccato beat on the floor the bloody ice pick protruding
through his foot

DONNA MARIE
Keep pulling Frankie Pull hard
Don’t stop

Sophia whips Imbasiano’s face with her Raggedy Ann Doll
Blood spills from his nose The staccato kicks slow down
Gradually the kicks stop For a long moment no one moves
Complete SILENCE

Then the SOUND of the assassin’s DEATH RATTLE-- spooking
Frankie He scoots back leaving bloody hand prints on the
floor

JULY
You did it Frankie

FRANNY
Oh my God Frankie You killed him

DONNA MARIE
No Not true We all killed him

Gently She wraps a handkerchief around Frankie’s hand-- Then
hugs him to her breast kissing the top of his head

The APARTMENT door suddenly flies open The White Haired man
framed in the doorway--

A pistol pointed directly at Donna Marie’s heart

WHITE-HAIRED MAN
Arrivederci bitch

A SHOT rings out Sophia SCREAMS The White-Haired Man
crumples to the floor

All eyes pivot-- to July Imbasiano’s 45 gripped in both
hands

Julys face is frozen in shock Donna Marie gently eases his
fingers open takes the weapon from his hands then enfolds
her son in her arms

DONNA MARIE
Sweet Juliano

Seated on the floor she kisses the top of his head then
wraps her arm around Frankie hugging both boys

DONNA MARIE (CONT’D)
My brave sons

Sophia runs over to join the family hug followed a beat
later by Franny her voice hoarse with fear

FRANNY
Mama Don Enzo has found us

DONNA MARIE
(whispers )
Yes he has

Her look shifts from Imbasiano’s corpse to the White Haired
Man sprawled dead in the doorway In her eyes one thought
lingers in her mind will it never end

Venetian blinds cast a ladder of shadows across her face

to a portrait of an old man reading a bible GAITANO the old
man bearded and bald sits across from Mike Sabatino

Donna Marie turns a page-- she looks around and sees to her
complete surprise-- Mike sitting across from her focused on
his sketch pad

Not wanting another confrontation she grabs her stuff starts
to leave Then stops-- Why should she let his disgusting
behavior drive her away” She sits forcing herself to
concentrate on ads Mike as yet hasn’t seen her

As he sketches she peeks quick little glances at him She
hadn’t realized he was so damned handsome Mike shows the
sketch to the old man

MIKE
What do you think Gaitano

GAITANO
Not bad But you should be drawing
beautiful women Like that one--
Over there

Mike looks sees Donna Marie Turns back

MIKE
Not on your life

GAITANO
Why not

MIKE

Believe me I have my reasons

GAITANO
Too bad She is

He kisses the tips of his fingers signifying how pretty she
is Mike takes a second look and realizes he is looking at a
beautiful woman The artist in him takes over He begins to

sketch
Gradually it dawns on Donna Marie what he is doing She
crosses to him

DONNA MARIE

thoroughly enjoying the confrontation

MIKE
The content of this sketch pad
happens to be my very own personal
private property This is not your
picture lady It is my picture

Fuming she spins on her heel goes back to her table Mike
glances at Gaitano The old man shakes his head silently
scolding Mike for his behavior

Donna Marie collects her belongings preparing to leave Mike
lays the sketch in front of her She looks at it then at
Mike a hint of distrust in her eyes

MIKE (CONTD)
A peace offering I owe you an
apology I’m really sorry I was a
complete ass

you squeeze the trigger Fire in
threes Your first shot is the
money shot The other two are
insurance

She aims takes a breath and fires three times Three
bullet holes appear in a loose cluster in the kill zone
Shalom is demonstrating an AK-47 to Franny

SHALOM
Short bursts Sweep the target
She’1l do all the work for you

FRANNY
She

SHALOM
Considering what an “AK” can do to
aman “she” is appropriate

Franny fires two bursts sweeping back and forth destroying
the targets

OPEN FIELD
Cade and Sophia approach a tree Cade holds out his hand

CADE
Gum

Sophia takes chewing gum out of her mouth and gives it to
Cade He presses a dime onto the gum then presses the gum on
to a tree trunk He points to two other trees

CADE (CONTD)
Three dimes the same separation an
enemy rifle squad keeps walking
across a field

AT THE FIRING TABLE
MIKE

Sophia close your eyes and open
your palm

She does Mike presses something into her palm then closes
it into a fist

MIKE (CONTD)
You can’t look in your hand until I
say okay

Cade has a rifle and scope mounted on a small tripod

DONNA MARIE
How far is that

SHALOM
A hundred and fifty yards

SOPHIA
Mr Cade are you going to hit all
of those little dimes

CADE
Yes ma’am And give you nine cents
change for each dime

Cade fires three rapid shots July and Frankie run from their
hiding places to retrieve the dimes Each dime has the center
cut out-- leaving three rings

MIKE
Sophia what’s three times nine

SOPHIA
(thinks it through)
Twenty seven

She opens her palm She’s holding a quarter and two pennies

SOPHIA (CONT’D)
Look mama-- twenty-seven cents

Donna Marie glances at the coins-- distressed She looks at
each of her children stopping on Franny who is smiling
holding her AK-47

DONNA MARIE
Franny boys put down your
weapons

They watch her walk to a bench under an oak She sits Mike
walks to the oak joining her

DONNA MARIE (CONT’D)
Sophia sees those coins as a prize
won in a contest I see three dead

men
(MORE)

DONNA MARIE (CONTD)
(looks up at him)
What I am doing to my children is
not just wrong it’s grotesque

Mike nods his understanding

MIKE
I grew up in the same neighborhood
as Tony Ferrante Ran numbers for
him collected bets even did some
loan sharking Never occurred to me
what I was doing was wrong just
that it was against the law After
a while I was brought into the
mob Then Pearl Harbor changed
everything

He sits next to her

MIKE (CONTD)

In the blink of an eye our country
gave us the legal right to kill
another human being Nothing
personal It was war We committed
unspeakable acts blew cities to
kingdom come-- completely destroyed
any remnant of human decency

DONNA MARIE
Except this was a war of good
versus evil

MIKE
Which we won by doing evil things
Everything about war is inside out
Everything you do is unthinkable
In a foxhole every one is trying to
kill you Your only choice is kill
or be killed You have no idea who
youre killing-- You’re shooting
shadows Somebody’s husband
father son brother A few years
later you’re shaking hands with
people who were trying to kill you
Crazy

DONNA MARIE
You survived

MIKE
I did

She rises Looks at Mike then strides with purpose to the
firing tables

She picks up a nine millimeter automatic slides in a
magazine She fires several rapid shots clustered in the kill
zone

LATER

A CLOUD of STARLINGS swoops over a recently plowed field
Donna Marie and Mike holding hands watch the flock’s sudden
changes of direction They start walking to the house

DONNA MARIE
Sophia has you wrapped around her
little finger

MIKE
Cade and Sorry are giving me some
competition

DONNA MARIE
She is an outrageous flirt

MIKE
Like mother like daughter

She slaps him on the shoulder He turns her to him

MIKE (CONTD)
Yknow Mrs Genero if you played
your cards right I could be
persuaded to marry you

DONNA MARIE
I have a deck of cards in my
bedroom Want to go up and play

MIKE
Cards

DONNA MARIE
We could do that too

MIKE
You should know I cheat

She opens the front door goes in

DONNA MARIE
I’m counting on it

Mike follows her
MIKE

You should get a cat A farm can
always use a good mouser
DONNA MARIE
I haven’t had much luck with cats

The door closes

MILKING BARN

She looks

SHALOM
Very impressive
FRANNY
Thank you
SHALOM
Can I try it
at him -- A trace of a smile on her face
FRANNY
You
SHALOM

Is that so unbelievable

FRANNY
I have a proposition I’1l teach
you how to milk if you teach me a
little hand-to-hand combat

SHALOM
There is nothing little about
fighting for your life

FRANNY
Just one little move What would
happen if you sneaked up behind me
and grabbed me

Franny is using her feminine wiles while not exactly knowing

she’s doing that Shalom realizes there is an opportunity

here He decides to play her game

He slips behind her -- wraps his arms around her waist

SHALOM
You mean like this

FRANNY
Yes Definitely Now what do I do

SHALOM
In a real situation you would snap
your head back and head butt me

FRANNY
I couldn’t do that

SHALOM
If your life depended on it you
could Try it

FRANNY
I might hurt you

SHALOM
Don’t worry Ill protect myself

FRANNY
Okay

An instant before Franny head butts him Donna Marie
approaches distracting Shalom from blocking Franny’s attack
Blood shoots out of his broken nose

FRANNY (CONTD)
Oh my God I’m so sorry

Shalom smiling stems the flow with a handkerchief Franny
kisses him sweetly on his lips Donna Marie simply shakes her
head Her daughter is growing up and there is not much she
can do about it

INT FARM HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

July cleans a weapon Frankie is helping Sophia do her

a magazine holding it close to her face She squints and
holds it closer Donna Marie grabs the magazine and throws it
on the table

DONNA MARIE
That’s it You are getting glasses

FRANNY
I am not wearing glasses They’1l
make me ugly

DONNA MARIE
Nothing will make you ugly
You are getting glasses

FRANNY
Mama I don’t want glasses
DONNA MARIE
If you had glasses you would have
known how close Shalom was before
you broke his nose

Frankie laughs

FRANKIE
We can call you Franny four eyes

FRANNY
Don’t you dare

Sophia grins exposing a mouth of missing teeth

SOPHIA
Can I call you four eyes Franny

FRANNY
You do I’1ll call you toothless

SOPHIA
I am not toothless Mama said my
teeth are going to grow back and
they’1ll be bigger than yours And

behind Jovani a stiletto clutched in her hand He catches
Franny’s look but before he can turn-- there is a loud RAP
at their door

Vincente and Jovani’s eyes snap to the sound

At that moment she plunges a stiletto into Jovani’s carotid
artery He drops to the floor like a stone Vincente wheels
at the sound to find Donna Marie aiming Delphino’s pearl
handled revolver at him

She is momentarily stunned by his grotesque appearance

Her brief loss of focus gives Vincente the edge he needs He
moves in back of Franny wraps his arm around her neck-- The
shotgun muzzle pressed up against her back
