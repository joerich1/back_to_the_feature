DISSOLVE TO
INT SALOON - DAY

Swinging doors open as the CAMERA TRACKS THROUGH them and into the crowded
barroom Its lunchtime on November 21 1932 and the place is full of
Westerners mostly civilians but also some scattered sailors We hear a trio
singing If I Had My Way a pop ballad from 1913 We have missed the first
line of the chorus (If I had my way dear forever thered be) but it
hardly

matters

TRIO
(singing lustily)
A garden of roses for you and for me

We PAN OVER to a piano keyboard where a burning cigarette is balanced upright
on the next-to-last key The pianist accompanying the singers snatches the
butt and takes a drag

TRIO
A thousand and one things dear I would do

We PAN OVER to the trio standing in a corner by the swinging doors -- three
ugly heavyset Westerners two men and a woman Someone tosses them a coin

from off screen and the guy in the center fails to catch it He has to bend
over to pick it up off the floor

TRIO
Just for you just for you just for you

Another coin is thrown This time the guy on the left fails to catch it The
coin falls toward the floor with a loud metallic clank The singers look down
at the floor We PAN DOWN just long enough to reveal a spittoon near the
singers feet then PAN BACK UP to the singers who reluctantly decide not to
retrieve that particular coin Never once during all this do they miss a
note

TRIO
If I had my way you would never grow old
And sunshine Id bring every day

On the word day a female patron approaches the heavy woman and whispers a
question in her ear Conveniently there is a pause in the song just long
enough for the singer to reply

HEAVY WOMAN
(brusquely)
First door to your left dearie

The female patron departs We TRACK DOWN the crowded bar and see two sailors
and a bartender toasting one another with huge glasses of beer a bartender
pouring drinks for other sailors and their dates various civilian men and
women wearing the latest styles uniformed chauffeurs ships officers and
crew of various nationalities etc At one point we briefly glimpse someone
carrying away the spittoon to retrieve the coin

TRIO
You would reign all alone
Like a queen on a throne
If I had my way

The song ends Patrons applaud We PAUSE at a middle-aged American bartender
mixing a complicated drink He grins and speaks to an unseen patron who sits
at the bar just off screen

BARTENDER 1
I havent made one of these since
the Fourth of July

In the background we hear the trio begin a new song another standard this
one from 1918 Till We Meet Again The bartender takes a long whiff of the
drinks aroma and adds some more ingredients

BARTENDER 1
I was makin one when the quake hit
Frisco

The bartender stirs the drink expertly and glances around

BARTENDER 1
Believe me friend I wouldnt go to
all this trouble for any of these
foreigners

With great pride he adds a few finishing touches pours the contents into a
glass and tops it off with an olive The unseen patrons hand reaches in to
pick up the glass but the bartender raises a finger at him

BARTENDER 1
Uh uh Gotta wait a minute to let
the oil sink in

The patron withdraws his hand Tossing a lemon slice behind his back and
catching it in midair the bartender twists it with a flourish over the
glass

He inspects the drink closely glances at the patron then gives the lemon
slice another grand twist before proudly sliding the glass away
Simultaneously we hear the trio conclude their song to much applause

BARTENDER 1
There you are partner You can tell
your grandchildren about that one

Finally we catch our first sight of the patron DAN HARDESTY a handsome
thirtyish American man as he puts the glass to his lips But before he can
drink hes bumped into from behind by a woman with her back to him Half the
drink spills out and ends up on the floor Dan turns angrily to the woman who
wears a big floppy hat

DAN
Say what in the name of--

The woman a dark-haired American beauty named JOAN AMES also turns and the
two come face to face She too has spilled some of her drink and is wide-
eyed with anger But as soon as their eyes meet their attitudes change

Both are somehow instantly smitten
And both realize they are holding the same obscure cocktail

In the background we hear the pianist play the films bittersweet love
theme

After a pause Joan finds her voice first

JOAN
Why Im so sorry

DAN
(a slight grin)
Im so glad

JOAN
(off his glass)
Such a beautiful drink too

DAN
Yes Paradise cocktail
(glances at his)
Seem to be a few drops left

JOAN
(steadily)
Always the most precious the last
few drops Thats luck

DAN
(surprised)
Yes

(beat)
Uh my name is Dan

JOAN
Mines Joan

DAN
Hello Joan

JOAN

Hello Dan
They shake hands like old friends

DAN
May we er drink to our meeting

JOAN
We should
(raises her glass)
Heres Heres hail and farewell
DAN

Oh that seems a bit ruthless
Lets say uh--

Abruptly two German voices drift in from the crowd -- apparently a couple of
sailors saying till we meet again to each other -- Auf wiedersehen Auf
wiedersehen -- Dan glances in their direction then turns back to Joan and

raises his glass inspired

DAN
Auf wiedersehen

Joan looks at Dan sadly for a beat and then agrees

JOAN
Auf wiedersehen

They swallow their drinks never taking their eyes off one another Dan holds
his empty glass by the stem and slowly turns it upside-down Joan watches
puzzled as Dan smashes the top of the glass against the side of the bar and
drops the stem on the countertop where it rolls back and forth for a moment

He grins at Joan who promptly responds in kind smashing her glass and
placing

her stem on top of his much to his surprise and delight We get a CLOSE VIEW
of the crossed stems Dan gallantly tips his hat to Joan

DAN
And so

Dan appears ready to leave but Joan puts an arm on him

JOAN
Please Shall I introduce you to my
friends

Joan gestures to some people crowded behind her at the bar Dan glances at
them and thinks it over but decides against it

DAN
I think not Luck has allowed us a
few drops of a Paradise cocktail--

JOAN
And that would destroy the charm
Youre right Lets trust luck will
come again

Joan puts her hand in Dans They stare into each others eyes for a long
moment A dark look crosses her face Her eyes waver and with a slight grin
she abruptly turns her back on him as if he were suddenly a total stranger

Dan looks thoughtful and puzzled but takes it in stride He turns and heads
for the swinging doors Joan turns and stares watching him walk away One of
Joans friends notices her interest and watches too

JOANS FRIEND
Known him long

JOAN
Ever so long

JOANS FRIEND
Where

JOAN
I - I cant quite remember

JOANS FRIEND
(wryly)
Better skip a few cocktails darling

Joan watches sadly as Dan exits out the saloons swinging doors He pauses
just outside and turns back to look over the tops of the doors at Joan After
a moment he raises a hand in farewell

At the bar Joan forces a smile and waves at Dan just as the pianist strikes
up a happier tune and her friends crowd around her

JOANS FRIEND
Come on everybody How about a
little drink to Joan

ANOTHER FRIEND
(hands Joan a drink)
Joan were drinking to you

JOANS FRIEND
To Joan dear
Joan distracted by her friends turns her back on Dan -- and fails to see
any
of the following

At the swinging doors Dan - his hand still raised - suddenly freezes with
fear His face clouds over his eyes lower -- and he slowly cautiously
raises his other hand It looks as if hes surrendering

And he is

We PAN DOWN as one of the doors swing open briefly to reveal an automatic
pistol pointed into Dans side

We PAN UP to show the guy holding the pistol a tough-looking square-jawed
man named STEVE BURKE

BURKE
Its been a long chase Dan

DAN
(never losing his cool)
Yes What detained you

Burke leans in to pat down his captive

BURKE
Never mind the wisecracks

Dan catches a whiff of Burkes breath

DAN
Still on the garlic huh

Burke insulted backs off a little
BURKE
Well nevertheless it looks like
youre out of luck this time
DAN
(nods)
Apparently

Dan desperately knocks the gun out of Burkes hand

FLASH CUT
of the gun hitting the pavement outside the saloon

DAN AND BURKE
struggle momentarily but Burke is the bigger man and Dan is no match for him
-- one punch in the jaw from Burke knocks him silly and drives him backwards

EXT SALOON AND STREET - CONTINUOUS

Burke easily pushes a stunned Dan into a nearby wall like a rag doll Burke
handcuffs himself to Dan then shakes his captive violently to wake him up
BURKE
Come on Come out of it

Dan regains consciousness blinks at Burke looks down at the cuffs
unhappily
and nods reluctantly accepting the situation

DAN
Okay you win

BURKE
I always win If you try to pull
another break like that on me Ill
deliver you in a basket Lets go

The two men pull their sleeves over the cuffs in a vain effort to look
inconspicuous as they start walking away from the saloon While Dan casts a
brief backward glance at the swinging doors Burke stoops and retrieves his
pistol pocketing it As they walk leisurely down the street various
passersby gawk and point at the two handcuffed men

DAN
Well now what

BURKE
The boat And then uh San Quentin

DAN
Can I get my clothes

BURKE
Oh theyre on the boat

DAN
Considerate

BURKE
Yeah

DAN

(rubs his sore jaw)
You know I thought I ditched you
way back in Berlin

BURKE
When I left Frisco the chief said
to me Steve dont come back alone
And he knew I wouldnt

Burke abruptly stops and stares at something off screen Dan still walking
forward is jerked back

BURKE
Ill be a son of a sea cow

Dan and Burke watch as SKIPPY a tipsy little American man in a straw boater
and bow tie waits for a Chinese shop owner to turn his back Skippy
instantly

snatches an alarm clock from a display and smoothly hides it in his jacket
But just as instantly the alarm clock goes off ringing loudly The Chinese
shop owner turns to look at Skippy who rolls his eyes in disgust sighs and
returns the clock to its proper place giving it a light tap It stops
ringing

as Skippy staggers drunkenly out of the shop and encounters Dan and Burke

BURKE
Well if it aint the light-fingered
Skippy

SKIPPY

(a happy drunk)
Hello Dan

DAN
Hello Skippy
BURKE
(to Skippy)

So this is your hide-out Hong Kong
must be pretty soft

SKIPPY
(nods)
I like it fine

BURKE
Yeah well ya better walk around
that USA of America like it was a
swamp

SKIPPY
(to Dan)
Its gettin so a guy cant go
nowheres nowadays without bumpin
into all sorts of people

BURKE
Duluth wants you Detroit wants you
Sacramento wants you

SKIPPY
Im wanted everywhere and welcome
nowhere Im just a vagabond
(spots the hand-
cuffs to Dan)
Ohhh thats too bad

DAN
You cant win all the time

BURKE
(to Dan leading him away)
Come on
SKIPPY
Anything I can do for you here Dan

DAN
(off Burke)
You might poison him

Dan and Burke walk off down the street Skippy calls after them

SKIPPY
Hey flatfoot

Burke looks back at Skippy with annoyance
SKIPPY
Tell those bulls Im an alien Ha ha

ha ha Ha ha ha ha ha ha

Skippys laugh is even more irritating than he is The handcuffed men walk on
-- Burke peeved Dan understandably glum

BURKE

No

DAN
Didnt you ever have a boyhood Cant

BURKE
No

DAN
Ha

BURKE

Whats so funny
DAN
I was wondering what youd do if you

were a cop in Venice

BURKE
Is that supposed to be a funny crack

DAN
Well it has its humorous side

e seeing Dan rapidly unlocks the railing mechanism

pushes the

to make it swing free then jumps backward off the deck

im as he falls The two disappear over the side

Dan and Burke fall backward into the water below still cuffed
together They hit the surface with a splash and disappear from view again

e bob to the surface Dan forces Burkes body under the water and
digs around in Burkes vest pocket for the handcuff key Somehow he is able
to find it and unlock his cuff as the two men struggle Burke tries to come
up

for air but Dan forces him down again Somewhere above a whistle blows and
someone shouts Man overboard

ON DECK
Officers and passengers rush to the ships side to see whats happening

IN THE WATER
Dan looks up to see

ON DECK
A crowd gathering at the railing peering down at him

IN THE WATER

With all those people watching Dan has no choice but to haul Burke out of
the

water by his hair

ON DECK
An even larger mob gathers

IN THE WATER
Dan reluctantly puts an arm around Burke and starts swimming for shore

DAN
(to the crowd)
Its all right Ive got him

ON DECK
Among the passengers watching with concern is none other than Joan She peers
down at the two men in the water failing to recognize Dan

IN THE WATER
Dan struggles toward shore with an unconscious Burke in tow Peering up he
sees

ON DECK (TELEPHOTO ZOOM SHOT FROM BELOW)
Joan wearing her big floppy hat leans over the railing

IN THE WATER
Dan sees Joan (and her hat) and smiles in recognition He keeps swimming

ON DECK
The crowd of onlookers grouped near a raised anchor watch with interest

IN THE WATER
Dan reaches a wooden pier and helps Burke on to a floating log lashed to it

DAN
Here ya are Reach for the log
Hold on

Burke regaining consciousness grips the log as Dan pulls himself atop it
Straddling the log Dan helps Burke out of the water
ON DECK

The crowd at the anchor watches in relief

IN THE WATER

Dan and Burke sit on the log Dan rises

DAN
Lucky for you I knew where that key
was

BURKE

(still dazed)
Yeah Thanks

Dan helps Burke to a nearby ladder

DISSOLVE TO

INT DAN AND BURKES STATEROOM - LATER

Dan puts on dry clothes as Burke already changed sits behind him
and holstering his pistol

BURKE
Hey you know somebody must have
left that rail unfastened Leanin
there and all of a sudden were in
the ocean

DAN
(dryly)
Yes We ought to sue the company

BURKE
I still cant see why you saved my
life with whats facing you

DAN
Ah suppose we dont discuss that

BURKE
Well anyway I - I kind o feel
like I ought to do you a little

favor

DAN
What For a little thing like your
life

checking

Dan hears the click of the handcuffs behind him and glances in Burkes

direction

DAN
Ill tell you what you can do

BURKE
What

PAN OVER TO Burke holding the open handcuffs in his hands
DAN
Those are not particularly becoming
to the well-dressed man Sides
once this ships at sea theres no
chance for a getaway Kind o
tough on both of us to be ironed
What do you say

Burke looks at the cuffs and thinks it over After a beat he pockets them

BURKE
All right Dan

DAN
(surprised but pleased)
Thanks

BURKE
But if you try to pull a fast one on
me Ill knock you off cold Is that

understood

DAN
Obviously

BURKE
I aint kiddin

DAN

Well I couldnt suspect you of that
Burke gives Dan a double take Dan looks amused
DAN
Well its kind of stuffy in here
All right if I go on deck
BURKE
(casually)

Sure

Dan grabs a cap and heads for the door Burke rises and follows grabbing a
jacket

BURKE
But Ill go along with ya

Dan nods in reluctant agreement and the two men exit the stateroom
DISSOLVE TO

A NEON SIGN
shaped like an arrow It reads To gangplank

We PAN OVER AND DOWN from this to the PURSERS STATION where Dan is in the
middle of a conversation with the uniformed purser
DAN
I have an important message to
deliver to her and like an idiot I
forgot her last name Her first name
is Joan

PURSER
Im sorry sir but--

DAN
(gesturing)
Shes about uh-- Oh shes about so
tall Jet black hair and large brown
eyes
PURSER

Well without her last name itll be
awfully hard for me to find her

During this conversation we PAN OVER to Burke who watches and listens from
under the gangplank sign shaking his head in disbelief Burke looks in the
direction of the gangplank as he hears a noisy crowd

THE GANGPLANK

is being unhooked from the ship A huge crowd of well-wishers fill the dock
waving to passengers on deck and chattering noisily Running through the
crowd

is Skippy who races up the gangplank just as it is pulled away and jumps onto
the ship ahead of the two Hong Kong policemen who are chasing him Skippy
relieved sits in the doorway where the gangplank was anchored a moment ago
and waves to the policemen who left stranded at the dock wave their
nightsticks at him angrily

SKIPPY
(salutes the police)
You must come and see us sometime

Skippy sitting in the gangplank doorway laughs his inimitable irritating
laugh and waves good-bye As he does a man comes up to Skippy from behind
and

pauses next to him - at first we see only the mans legs The boats whistle
blows ominously as Skippy looks down to see the two flat feet beside him His
face falls as he looks up to see Burke hands in his pockets towering over
him grimly

JOAN AND HER DOCTOR
Joan sits glumly as the doctor stands over her trying to be gentle

DOCTOR
Youre cutting your months into
weeks your weeks into days--

JOAN
And my days into hours Is that it

DOCTOR
It is

JOAN
What you really mean -- and youre
too kind to say -- is that if I stay

in my stateroom lie in bed deny
myself everything even the - the
mildest diversion I may live to
arrive at that charming sanitarium

DOCTOR
You state it very cruelly

Joan rises and crosses to her cabins window She looks out

JOAN
Its not a pretty picture is it
(reluctantly)
All right All right doctor Ill
do what you say
(chuckles)
Funny how we cling to life even
after its worthless

Joan hears the sound of Dans voice drifting in through the open window

DANS VOICE
Shes about so tall black hair
large brown eyes Her first name is
Joan

Peering through the window Joan sees Dan walking the deck with a steward
Delighted she watches them pass and then turns back to the doctor

JOAN

Oh no No I was wrong I know now
what I want I want to crowd all the
intense beautiful happiness possible
into what life Ive got left Thats
all livings for If its only for a
few hours I want to have it And Im
going to have it -- all I can get my
hands on

Joan leaves the window moves toward the door The doctor tries to stop her

DOCTOR
Joan I--

JOAN
Now doctor I am going on deck

DOCTOR
But Jo--

JOAN
Goodbye

With a huge smile she breaks away from him and is instantly out the door
slamming it shut behind her

CUT TO
INT SHIPS LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER

DAN
sits at the bar as a young bartender mixes him a drink

BARTENDER 2
(to Dan)
I dont know she mightve been in
here but I didnt notice her
JOAN
enters the lounge and looks around anxiously She spots

DAN
who is busy lighting a cigarette and fails to see her

DAN
(to the bartender)
Mm then she wasnt here Youdve
noticed her

JOAN smiling radiantly checks her hair and then moves toward Dan

AT THE BAR

Joan joins Dan at the bar approaching him from behind so that he doesnt see
her The bartender having just poured Dans drink now looks up from his
work

and notices her He raises his eyebrows and smiles in recognition

She indicates with a gesture that he should pour her the same drink -- which
he promptly does with a grin The bartender watches with interest as Dan
puts

his glass to his lips at the same moment Joan speaks to him

JOAN
Hello Dan

Dan turns and looks at her pleased and surprised We hear their love theme

DAN
Hello Joan

JOAN
The lucks come back

Dan nods noticing that once again they both hold the same drink

DAN
This time in full glasses

JOAN
We mustnt lose a drop Dan

DAN
(toasts her)
Health

A dark look crosses Joans face She recovers with a smile and corrects him

JOAN
Luck

Once again they swallow their drinks never taking their eyes from one
another They exchange grins

The bartender smiles warmly at this
Joan holding her glass by the stem smashes it against the bar
The bartenders eyes pop in surprise
Joan places her stem on the countertop Then Dan smashes his glass

The startled bartender flinches

As before Dan crosses his stem with Joans They smile at each other as we
TRUCK FORWARD for a CLOSER VIEW of the crossed stems on the countertop
between

them

JOAN

Joan thinks about this a moment and then turns to look at the ocean

CUT TO

EXT DECK - NIGHT

Dan and Burke in dinner clothes stand outside the ships lounge peering in
through the well-lit windows Classical piano music The two men enter
through

a nearby door

CUT TO
INT LOUNGE - NIGHT

A smartly-dressed crowd listens as an attractive aristocratic woman
elegantly

plays a grand piano We get a CLOSE VIEW of the woman known to her fellow
passengers as Countess Bettina de Barilhaus but whom we shall call BETTY for
short
Dan and Burke arrive as Betty concludes her number The crowd applauds Betty
rises and catches sight of Dan and Burke Burke stares at her with interest
Dan lowers his eyes and tries to look bored

Betty carrying an expensive fan joins her stiff British date -- a tuxedoed
monocled nobleman named SIR HAROLD

BETTY
(pleasantly with a
vaguely European accent)
Now we must be going

Sir Harold nods and the two begin to walk off together Members of the crowd
groan and protest Aw Countess Please -- but she waves them off
politely

BETTY
No no no no Youll forgive me

Im very fatigued Some other time

But before she can get away a bejeweled dowager stops her

DOWAGER
Oh Countess are you of the Bavarian
Barilhauses
BETTY
(coolly)

Mm the elder son

DOWAGER
I had the pleasure in meeting them
last summer

BETTY
(unenthusiastic)
Delightful We must have tea
together some time

Betty moves off Sir Harold follows like a puppy dog

SIR HAROLD
Countess you play divinely

As she passes Betty ignores Burke but pauses ever so slightly to get a good
look at Dan who pointedly shows no sign of recognizing her Burke watches
Betty struck by her beauty

Betty and Sir Harold stand apart from the others

SIR HAROLD
Shall I see you later Countess

BETTY
Not tonight Sir Harold Tomorrow
night I promise you
Betty puts her hand in his

SIR HAROLD
I shall live in anticipation

Sir Harold kisses Bettys hand grandly

Burke jealously watches all this with interest -- its not the sort of
activity a Frisco cop sees much of

DAN
(amused to Burke)
Dont let the royalty get you down

Dan moves off as Burke smiles self-consciously and gives him a dismissive
wave

Fanning herself Betty watches Sir Harold walk away He pauses turns and
delivers a courtly bow to her She nods in reply and they turn from one
another As they do Skippy abruptly enters and nearly bumps into Betty His
face lights up with recognition

SKIPPY
Well If it aint--

Skippy offers a hand in greeting But Betty ignores this instantly dropping
both her voice and her European accent

BETTY
(American accent)
Play dead chump Tail me to my
joint

Skippy watches with surprise as Betty fanning herself briskly walks off He
puts on his hat and nonchalantly strolls after her

AT THE BAR

Burke joins the same young bartender who waited on Dan and Joan earlier
Self-

conscious about his garlic breath Burke screws up his face and glances in
Dans direction while deciding what to order

BARTENDER 2
Something I can do for you sir

BURKE
(unhappily)
Buttermilk

BARTENDER 2
Yes sir

Bartender pulls out a tall glass and a pitcher of buttermilk

BURKE
Say pal will ya do me a favor
BARTENDER 2
Yes sir

BURKE
What do you call a countess when you
wanna speak to her

BARTENDER 2
Hmm
(unconvincingly)
Madame la Countesse

We PAN DOWN the bar to another bartender who assembles an elaborate tray of
bottles glasses ice and other mixings A steward takes the tray and
carries

it off

DISSOLVE TO
INT BETTYS CABIN - LATER

The steward arrives at the cabin door with the elaborate tray and knocks
After a moment he opens the door and enters placing the tray on a table
Also visible on the table are Skippys feet which are propped up on the edge
Skippy tosses a coin onto the tray -- a tip for the steward

SKIPPY
Thank you

The steward takes the coin and departs closing the door behind him Skippy
takes his feet down off the table reaches over and grabs a bottle of gin
from

the tray We see his smiling face for the first time as he opens the bottle
and brings it to his lips He chugs the contents And chugs And chugs

We CUT WIDE to reveal that Betty is lounging nearby on a sofa watching him
After a moment she speaks to him -- not with her fancy European accent but
with her tough American one

BETTY
Say dont you ever breathe

Skippy stops drinking exhales deeply and hands Betty the bottle She wipes
the mouth of the bottle and takes a fairly long swig herself -- much to
Skippys surprise Skippy looks over the tray with all its mixings

SKIPPY
Whats the idea of all the landscape
gardening

BETTY

(haughtily using her
fake European accent)
Oh straight gin is so vulgar my
dear --
(instantly lapsing
into Americanese)
Oh boy Are my pups growling

Betty leans over and rubs her sore feet

SKIPPY
(amused)
Betty dont they ever get on to

BETTY

her bangs)

SKIPPY
Oh Barilhaus Oh I get it

BETTY

Englishman with the single cheater

She means of course Sir Harold and his monocle Betty dabs a cloth with gin

Betty sees something out the window and draws back the curtain for a better
look She glances over at Skippy motions with her eyes for him to join her
then continues to stare out

BETTY

Burke watches them go then takes a few deep breaths and starts his first lap
around the deck Farther down the deck we see

BETTY
sitting in a lounge chair with a book in hand She grins at

SKIPPY
standing nearby He readies himself and then adopts a drunken attitude
staggering forward

WIDE SHOT

Skippy staggers down the deck and pretends to lose his balance collapsing on
top of Betty who screams Skippy sitting on her legs tips his hat to her
apologetically as Burke strides into view grabs Skippys collar and hauls
him

to his feet

BURKE
Hey you little tramp I ought to
throw you overboard

Burke shoves Skippy who wobbles away

BETTY
sighs whimpers and employs her European accent pretending to be a damsel
in
distress to engage Burkes sympathy

BETTY

Isnt it possible for a lady to to
go anywhere nowadays without bumping
into all sorts of people

SKIPPY
peers around a corner at Burke and Betty

BURKE

Betty offers Burke her hand He is about to bend over to kiss it when he
looks

around self-consciously and decides instead to shake it vigorously She
invites him to sit in the lounge chair next to her

BETTY

a few minutes hm

watching from around the corner laughs his irritating laugh to himself and
heads off to the bar

CUT TO

INT SHIPS LOUNGE - DAY
At the bar a patron downs a drink and then walks away just as Skippy
arrives Seeing that the bartender at the cash register has his back turned
to

him Skippy left alone with the patrons empty glass and a nearly full
bottle

of liquor pours himself a drink He knocks it back rapidly holding onto his
hat to keep it from falling off He quickly sets the glass down and tries to
look nonchalant

Seeing that the bartender is still busy at the register Skippy pours himself
another shot downs it fast and resumes his nonchalant pose Finally Skippy
ignores the glass and simply grabs the bottle to chug down even more alcohol
Satisfied he exhales deeply grins hiccups buttons his coat and starts to
move off

At last the bartender hands full of money turns from the cash register and
sees Skippy trying to leave unnoticed

BARTENDER 2
Hey

SKIPPY
Oh yes Almost forgot My change

The bartender raises his eyebrows in surprise and squints in confusion
BARTENDER 2
I beg your pardon sir What was it

you gave me

SKIPPY
I gave ya a five dollar bill

The bartender counts out the change
BARTENDER 2
Yes sir Im - Im sorry sir
Sorry sir
SKIPPY
Oh oh wait you only took off
for one drink I had three

Skippy shoves some of the change back

BARTENDER 2
Oh thank you sir thank you

SKIPPY
Think nothing of it my good man

The smiling bartender watches Skippy walk off with the money
CUT TO

INT HALLWAY - DAY
A drunken Skippy bumbles down the hallway toward a full-length mirror
mistakes his own reflection for an oncoming passenger and backs up a little
to let the person pass He takes off his hat and bows apologetically

SKIPPY
I beg your pardon

After a pause he straightens and heads toward the mirror again And exactly
as before he mistakes his own reflection for an oncoming passenger backs up
a little takes off his hat and bows

SKIPPY
After you sir

Another pause Skippy straightens and again heads toward the mirror spots
his

reflection and backs away This time another passenger actually does walk
by

Skippy looks up at the man

SKIPPY
(annoyed to the man)
Say how long is this parade gonna
last

Puzzled the man looks at Skippy for a moment says nothing then walks off

SKIPPY
(to the man)
Oh you wont talk huh

Skippy snaps his fingers with contempt at the departing man then turns and
heads back toward the mirror -- where he once again runs into his reflection
This time he raises a hand in protest

SKIPPY
No you dont No you dont

NEW ANGLE - SKIPPY (MIRROR NOT VISIBLE)
Skippy beats his chest

SKIPPY
Its my turn now

Skippy adjusts his jacket barges forward and smashes into the mirror
shattering it with a crash

SKIPPY AND THE BROKEN MIRROR

We discover him on hands and knees amid broken shards of glass talking to
himself

SKIPPY
Well you got away with it that
time But I know what you look like
And it wont happen again

A couple of VIEWS of sailors dressed warmly sporting binoculars peering
into
the fog-enshrouded night as a fog horn blows

DISSOLVE TO
INT SHIPS LOUNGE - NIGHT

Starting with a tuba (matched to the fog horn) we PAN OVER the ships
orchestra as it plays dance music Then we PAN OVER to the numerous dancers
in the lounge Betty dances with Sir Harold but smiles at Burke who stands to
one side watching her He scowls a little annoyed and puzzled that shes
dancing with another man

We PAN OVER to Dan and Joan also on the dance floor in utter bliss The
song
ends Nearly everyone breaks and applauds the musicians But Dan and Joan
stay

in each others arms and regard one another lovingly

The next number begins a livelier uptempo piece Sir Harold attempts to
dance

with Betty but Burke muscles in brusquely grabs Sir Harolds wrist and
pushes

him away showing no regard for etiquette Betty merely hands her elegant fan
to Sir Harold who nods politely and watches as Burke grabs Betty and dances
away with her

Betty and Burke turn out to be the best rubber-legged dancers on the floor
Skippy hat in hand watches the couple from the sidelines

Burke puts a lot of energy into his eccentric dance moves

Skippy points and laughs his irritating laugh

Burke and Betty pause at the sound of the laugh to stare at Skippy

But he just keeps laughing at them

Betty smiles as Burke gives Skippy a long dirty look They dance even more
energetically

A grim Sir Harold watches all this unhappily fanning himself with Bettys
fan After a moment he peers down at the fan realizes he looks ridiculous
and folds it up

DAN AND JOAN meanwhile are also still on the floor

On the sidelines Joans doctor watches the two of them with concern She is
clearly overexerting herself

Joan looks stricken pauses and leans on Dan for support

JOAN
Dan Dan wait

DAN
Oh my dear What is it sweet

JOAN
Im all right Lets - lets go out
on deck

DAN

Yes of course dear

As the music ends and the crowd applauds Dan helps Joan off the floor The
doctor seeing this shakes his head sadly and moves off

CUT TO

As the ships orchestra plays their love theme Dan and Joan sit together in
the fog

Dan kisses Joans hand affectionately

SKIPPY

Dan watches the steward exit then quickly grabs a heavy glass water decanter
from a nearby table and dumps it out in the bathroom sink Spotting a towel
he grabs it and carries the decanter and the towel to the rear of the cabin
He places the decanter strategically on the table then opens the towel
twists it into a gag and places it against his mouth for measure Satisfied
it

will gag Burke effectively he hides it under a bed sheet

IN THE HALL
outside the cabin Burke arrives He pauses at the door looks around Then
taking no chances he draws his pistol and checks it No bullets He takes

out
the clip empty He casts a suspicious look at the door

IN THE ROOM
Dan readies a rope with which to tie Burke

IN THE HALL

Scowling Burke nods in understanding guessing that Dan has stolen his
ammunition He takes a fresh clip from his pocket loads and reholsters his
gun

IN THE ROOM

Dan hears Burke opening the door and stuffs the rope under his pillow Then
smoothing his hair moves to a bureau and grabs a cigarette He turns to see
Burke staring at him grimly Dan lights his cigarette

DAN
Well pal you look pretty smooth
Going ashore

BURKE
Yeah but Im sorry pal Youre

Burke moves casually into the bathroom Dan just as casually moves in his
direction

DAN
Thats a bit tough but I cant

Burke in the bathroom keeps an eye on Dan in the bathroom mirror
BURKE
Yeah you know how it is A guys

gotta do his duty

Burke watches in the mirror as Dan sets down his cigarette and picks up the
heavy glass decanter

Burke reaches for his pistol
Dan raises the decanter and moves forward rapidly
Grinning Burke spins and fires

The decanter shatters and Dan freezes staring first at Burke and then at the
broken glass in his upraised hand Dan looks stunned and puzzled then lowers
his hand and sighs at Burke

DAN
Not bad

Burke covers Dan with his pistol

BURKE
And now if youve no serious
objections pal lets get going

DAN
No objections

Dan sets whats left of the decanter down The two men move to the door and
exit

Passersby murmur noisily having heard the sound of a gunshot Burke holsters
his pistol

Noises from the engine room reverberate as Dan and Burke walk down several
flights of narrow stairs They pass a good deal of machinery deep in the
bowels of the ship Occasionally Dan must pause to get directions from Burke
who stays behind him at all times Finally they arrive at the brig

Skippy trails behind peering around a corner

Burke unlocks and opens the cell door then points for Dan to enter Dan
enters and Burke locks him in Burke starts to leave but then decides to say
something to Dan through the door

Joans heart gives out -- she faints collapsing into his arms

DAN
My dear Joan Dear

But she is unconscious A ships horn blows Dan looks up to see his
chartered
steamship anchored nearby

He glances down at Joan in his arms then turns to see the S S Maloa in
front of him

Joyful Hawaiian music plays Passengers line the deck tossing streamers and
waving Aloha Also on deck Joans doctor who peers at the shore
worriedly

Dan glances at his steamship and at Joan who clearly needs medical
attention

then makes a decision He hoists Joan up and starts to carry her toward the
Maloa just as a friendly Hawaiian man approaches

HAWAIIAN MAN
Might I help you

DAN
Yes will you turn that car around
And -- keep the engine going

HAWAIIAN MAN
Yes sir

Dan rushes off toward the gangplank with Joan in his arms
CUT TO
EXT THE MALOA - CONTINUOUS
On deck Burke and Betty lean on the railing watching the festivities Both
suddenly spot Dan on the dock hauling Joan in his arms Incredulous Burke

feels in his pocket for the brig key pulls it out and looks at it Betty
fully aware of whats happening keeps a stone face
Dan carries Joan up the gangplank which is festooned with streamers The
doctor meets him and they hurry off to Joans cabin

Burke grim pockets the key and rushes off -- without a word to Betty who
after a moment follows him

CUT TO
INT THE MALOA - CONTINUOUS
The doctor opens the cabin door for Dan who carries Joan inside and sets her
on the bed The lively Hawaiian melody gives way to the more somber Aloha
Oe

as the doctor quickly examines her

DAN
Is she all right Doctor

After a moment the doctor looks at Dan and nods

DOCTOR
I believe so

Dan starts to withdraw Joan looks like death warmed over Dan takes a last
look and turns to go

But Joan without opening her eyes regains consciousness and calls out to
him

JOAN
Dan

He pauses and reluctantly returns to the bed leaning over her

DAN
Yes dear

She cant open her eyes but somehow has the strength to put her arm around
him

JOAN
Dan Dont leave me

The ships horn blows noisily Dan looks around realizing he cant get off
the ship He strokes her hair and presses his cheek to hers gently She
manages a smile

The doctor pleased at this withdraws

Dan pulls away from her seeing that Joan has fallen unconscious again

Burke brusquely enters the cabin but pauses at the sight of Dan at Joans
bedside Clearly Dan isnt going anywhere Joans hand falls limp at her
side Burke turns away thoughtfully and slowly exits taking one last look at

the couple before quietly closing the cabin door behind him

IN THE HALL
Burke fails to see Betty standing behind him as he shuts the door turns and
talks to himself sadly

BURKE
Poor guy

BETTY
What did you say

Startled Burke turns to see Betty He is immediately self-conscious

BURKE
Oh I didnt say nothin

Betty watches as Burke flustered walks off After a moment she follows him
down the hall

IN THE CABIN

As Dan watches over an unconscious Joan he notices an envelope on her night
stand the farewell letter he had written to her early that morning
Somewhere

off screen a chorus of singers croons Aloha Oe as Dan takes the envelope
and pockets it

ON DECK

Streamers fly as a sour-faced Burke leans against the railing and watches the
crowd A sympathetic Betty joins him and takes his hand affectionately She
maintains her European accent even as she tells him

BETTY
Ah youre a swell guy Steve

She rests her head on his shoulder Burke gives her a puzzled look then
brightens a little and straightens up The two look down to see

THE GANGPLANK

being unhooked from the ship A huge crowd of well-wishers fill the dock
waving to passengers on deck and singing Aloha Oe Bursting out of the
crowd

is Skippy wearing a lei He races up the streamer-clogged gangplank just as
it is pulled away and jumps onto the ship well ahead of the two Hawaiian
policemen chasing him Left stranded at the dock they shake their fingers
and

yell for him to Get out and Dont come back

ON DECK
Burke rushes away from an amused Betty to join Skippy at the gangplank
doorway Skippy points to the policeman

SKIPPY
Dont forget to write now will ya

Skippy laughs his annoying laugh as a grim-looking Burke hands in pockets
strides into view behind him Skippy turns to see Burke and stops in mid-

laugh Smugly Burke nods and gives Skippy a sneering smile

BURKE
The next stop sucker is San
Francisco

Without a word Skippy adjusts his jacket and wobbles off

THE SHIP
pulls away from the dock as the crowd waves and finishes singing Aloha Oe

DAN

DOCTOR
Oh nothings happened I just want
to have a little talk with you

DAN
Well

DOCTOR

Her condition is desperate She must

shes to reach the mainland alive
She survived this attack but it
isnt humanly possible for her to

excitement might kill her A shock
surely would Can I depend upon you

DAN
Of course
DOCTOR

SKIPPY

Betty closes the door behind Skippy and goes back to brushing her hair as he
pulls out a wad of money and counts out some bills

Betty inspects the bills English pounds

RADIO ROOM - THAT MOMENT

A headphone-wearing radio operator hands a newly-received wire to the British
steward

RADIO OPERATOR
Here get a load of this

As an ominous horn blows the steward reads the telegram

The steward hands the message back to the radio operator who puts it in an
envelope for delivery

STEWARD
Ive seen some royalty in my time
but I thought she was the grandest
of the lot I hate to deliver it

Amused the radio operator hands the envelope to the steward who promptly
exits the radio room with it and heads off grimly down the deck

BURKE AND BETTY
standing together at the rail

BURKE
You know Im sort of tired of bein
a copper
Betty looks at him puzzled
BURKE

Oh I dont know I - I just sort of
feel that I wont enjoy being the

And I was wondering if youd be well
I sort of - I sort of thought that--
Well anyway I got a ranch half

BURKE

Betty is of course stunned She reaches a decision

BETTY
Oh Id love it Steven but--
Theres something I have to tell

(drops her phony accent)
Aw youre a right guy and Im gonna
come clean with ya

Now it is Burkes turn to be stunned
BETTY
In the first place Im not a

countess-—

Abruptly the steward arrives and hands Burke the envelope
STEWARD
Beg your pardon sir

Betty turns away in embarrassment Even as he stares at her Burke accepts
the

envelope and waves off the steward who departs Burke opens the message and
reads it He looks up and squints at Betty then crumples the message in his
fist

BURKE
(darkly)
You were sayin

Betty turns back to him bluntly

BETTY
I was sayin Im not any of the
things you think I am Ive been a
long way And Ive left a wide
trail

Burke takes Bettys hand and smiles

They clink glasses gently and drink never taking their eyes off one another
They drain their glasses and break into smiles again And they smash their
glasses on the side of the bar -- simultaneously

THE BARTENDER nearby winces

DAN AND JOAN
cross the stems on the countertop

THE BARTENDER frustrated snatches up two glasses in front of him and throws
them to the floor with a crash

overhears

BURKE
Ive got to deliver you according to
Hoyle You know this aint any petty
larceny rap its murder
The steward raises his eyebrows at the word murder He watches in amazement
as Dan pulls up his sleeve and Burke puts on the cuffs Quickly the steward
turns and walks off unnoticed by either Burke or Dan

DAN
If we could get off the boat without
her seeing us--

BURKE
Ill do my best

DAN
Thanks Lets go

The two men head for the door Dan picks up his overcoat and drapes it over
their arms concealing the cuffs He picks up his hat and pulls the cabin

open wide so that they may leave After a pause the men exit with Dan
leading the way

stands in her cabin looking unwell She turns and exits into the hall We
TRACK WITH her as she walks nervously along glancing around for any sign of
Dan She heads down a stairwell

DAN AND BURKE
arrive at a pursers station on their deck preparing to check out

JOAN
descends the stairwell and arrives at Dans door Shes just about to knock
when she hears the voice of the British steward coming from inside the room

STEWARDS VOICE
You could have knocked me down with
a belaying pin And then as nice as
you please he put the handcuffs on
him

Joan confused knocks

IN DAN AND BURKES STATEROOM
the steward turns from the maid he is speaking to and opens the door Joan
enters and looks around in surprise

JOAN
Wheres Mr Hardesty

STEWARD
I was just telling her Miss Right
here in front of my very eyes his
friend his best pal as you might
rightly call him takes out a pair
of handcuffs and -- snap snap --
and hes a prisoner With their
hands at their side out they goes

Growing pale Joan stares at the steward in disbelief

JOAN
Dan

STEWARD
The very same Miss And a nicer
gentleman you wouldnt wish to meet
And him a red-handed murderer And
heres me bobbin in and out of
here with no thought of me own life
turning me back on him Why he
might have cut my throat from ear to
ear

Before the steward can finish Joan breathing hard staggers back to the
door

and leans in the doorway eyes shut After a moment she opens her eyes in
horror then desperately rushes back to the stairwell and rapidly climbs the
stairs

DAN AND BURKE
still at the pursers station Dan glances around uncertainly

JOAN
having reached the top of the stairs looks up and down the hall worriedly
then we TRACK WITH her as she rushes in the direction of the deck

DAN AND BURKE
still at the pursers station

TRACKING WITH JOAN

who struggles through the crowd of passengers searching for Dan But theres
no sign of him She clutches a hand to her head then presses forward through
the mob

DAN AND BURKE
still at the pursers station

TRACKING WITH JOAN

through the crowded deck She pauses and puts a hand to her head again She
grows dizzy The CAMERA MIRRORS her dizziness but she presses on
disappearing

into the mob

DAN AND BURKE
finally depart the pursers station

AT A STAIRWELL

The hallway is empty Joan rushes into view and climbs the stairs A brief
moment later Dan and Burke emerge from the lower deck and head toward the
gangplank
JOAN ON UPPER DECK
apparently lost She ducks in a doorway

DAN AND BURKE
stuck in the line at the gangplank which has apparently not been hooked up
yet They look around unhappily unable to disembark right away

DAN
fails to see Joan appear several yards behind him

JOAN
sees Dan She pauses relieved

DAN
still hasnt noticed her

JOAN
raises a hand to him

JOAN

He puts out his free hand to her

JOAN
presses forward

DAN AND JOAN

JOAN
peers into Dans face knowing she will never see him again She smiles

JOAN

shakes his head with a slight grin

DAN
Not goodbye dear Auf wiedersehen

JOAN
glows happily In the background we hear the gangplank

JOAN
Auf wiedersehen

kiss deeply Passengers begin to file out behind them down the gangplank
They break the kiss

JOAN
watches smiling as Dan too retreats toward the gangplank

JOANS POV - DAN
Nearly lost in the crowd He looks back at her over the top of the crowd and
waves just as he had over the saloons swinging doors way back in Hong Kong

JOAN
delighted returns the wave

WITH them for a moment and then PAN BACK UP past the other departing
passengers to

upon which is printed

AGUA CALIENTE
HAPPY NEW YEAR

A crowd roars and hollers Happy New Year
A band plays a lively version of Auld Lang Syne

Someone sticks a cigarette in the balloon and we hear but do not see it
burst

Instead we CUT TO a fast TRACKING SHOT that runs parallel to a nightclub --
part of the Agua Caliente resort in Tijuana Mexico The place is packed with
well-dressed revelers tuxedoes and evening gowns and party hats Streamers
and balloons and noisemakers are everywhere They dance they drink they sit
at tables and order food they make merry

We SWOOP PAST them all to the far end of the club which is nearly deserted
Two bartenders stand together polishing glasses at a bar At one end of the
bar a lone figure sits on a stool We dont recognize him at first

But then we abruptly leave our parallel track and RAPIDLY GLIDE IN and PAST
the man for a brief seconds-long glimpse it is Skippy as we have not seen
him before -- well-groomed in a black tux nursing a drink but looking very
sober lost in thought

In a moment he is gone and we catch a short view of the partying mob behind
him as we PAN OVER to the two bartenders wiping their glasses nearby
BARTENDER 4
Ill be glad when this things over

BARTENDER 5
Youre telling me These holidays
are dynamite

They hear the sound of glasses shattering
BARTENDER 4
Hey Look out for them glasses with
your elbow
BARTENDER 5
(indignant)

I never touched any glasses

Confused the bartenders turn in the direction of the noise We hear Dan and
Joans theme as we PUSH FORWARD and between the bartenders to discover the
stems of two broken glasses crossed on the countertop dancing couples
visible

in the background

After a moment the broken glass vanishes ghost-like into nothingness

FADE OUT

END TITLE

Till We Meet Again

Smile the while you kiss me sad adieu
When the clouds roll by Ill come to you

Then the skies will seem more blue
Down in Lovers Lane my dearie

Wedding bells will ring so merrily
Evry tear will be a memory

So wait and pray each night for me
Till we meet again
Where Was I

Dan and Joans love theme became a 1 pop hit in 1940
with Al Dubins words set to W Frank Harlings music
The song was introduced in Til We Meet Again -- the
1940 remake of One Way Passage

Oh where was I
The night that you surrendered to a sigh
Where was I

The moon was high
The night that you first listened to a lie
Where was I

I always felt that you would melt
In someones arms some night
And I was right

The moment came
But what a shame that someone else came by
Where was I
