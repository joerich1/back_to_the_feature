My name is Kathy

EXT FIELD - EARLY EVENING

Long shadows as the sun goes down
A field by a road lined with a fence

Snagged in the barbed wire are hundreds of plastic bags
Refuse and litter blown by the wind until they were
caught

KATHY (VO)
I’m twenty six years old and
Ive been a carer now for seven
years

By the road a car is parked up against the grass verge

Standing by the car a young woman with blonde hair KATHY
looks towards the fields

KATHY (VO) (CONTD)
My donors have always tended to
do better than expected They
are hardly ever classified as
agitated even before a fourth
donation

INT OBSERVATION ROOM

- the same woman KATHY standing at the window of an
observation room

She is absentmindedly twisting a metal bracelet on her
wrist which is featureless except for an imprinted seven
digit number

Through the glass she is watching NURSES and SURGEONS
prepping a twenty six year-old man for operation

TOMMY
SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p2

KATHY (VO)
I’m not trying to boast It
means a lot to me being able to
do my work well

INT OPERATING CHAMBER

TOMMY is in the process of being sedated
He also wears a metal bracelet

Beside him an ANESTHETIST is inserting a drip into his
arm

KATHY (VO)

Especially keeping the donors
calm

INT OBSERVATION ROOM

TOMMY turns his head to look at KATHY

Their locked gaze is held for a beat

Then KATHY nods Very slight As if to say it’s okay
TOMMY continues looking a moment longer

Then the ANESTHETIST’S drug takes a hold of him Ina few
seconds his eyes have gone heavy then closed

KATHY (VO)
Anyway I’m not making any great
claims for myself

BACK TO -

EXT FIELD - EARLY EVENING

The plastic bags in the barbed wire snap and rustle in the
wind

KATHY (VO)
I understand how other carers can
be resentful They say she’s
from Hailsham No wonder she has
a great record She can pick and
choose her own kind

As we CLOSE IN on KATHY leaning against the car her hair
caught and whipped in the same wind

FADE IN the sound of children playing

KATHY (VO) (CONTD)
And it’s true Hailsham was
special We were lucky Tommy

EXT HAILSHAM - DAY

HAILSHAM SCHOOL a large Victorian house set in flat
empty countryside

The sky above is bright blue and cloudless The sun is
bright It is an idyll of early summer

The extensive grounds of the school are surrounded by high
hedgerows Nothing seems to connect it with the rest of
the world except a single grey ribbon of road

Title

NEVER LET ME GO

The title is not seen but is SPOKEN by TOMMY

After a few seconds a title does appear on the screen

PART 1 HAILSHAM

EXT HAILSHAM GROUNDS - DAY

In sunlight two girls aged twelve lie on their bellies
on a patch in front of the main house

Both wear the metal bracelets - as do all students at
Hailsham and all other facilities like it

The grass is strewn with daisies
One girl has blonde hair This is KATHY
The other is dark This is RUTH

KATHY is interlocking the stems of the small flowers
frowning in concentration making a daisy chain

RUTH
I think one day Id like
SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p4

RUTH pauses Thinking a moment

RUTH (CONTD)
Four horses
(beat)
No five Thunder Bramble
Daffodil and

RUTH trails off

RUTH (CONTD)

I don’t know all their names
But I’d like five horses

(beat)
The best would be Thunder He’d
be dangerous to ride so you
can’t ride him You can ride
Bramble

(beat)
As long as you don’t use your
crop on him

KATHY
I wouldn’t anyway I would have
thought that’s mean
KATHY makes the last link
She lifts the daisy chain delicately

RUTH
Pretty

KATHY
You have it

KATHY places it over RUTH’S blonde hair
where it looks like it belongs

RUTH
» Look

KATHY follows RUTH’S gaze

By the entrance of the main house two women have appeared
One is older in her mid sixties This is MISS EMILY the
head guardian of Hailsham

The other is younger in her late twenties

RUTH (CONTD)
Who’s that with Miss Emily Do
you think it’s the new guardian
they were telling us about
8A

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p5
KATHY
Miss Lucy I think it must be
RUTH
We haven’t had a new guardian for

ages

A moment as the two girls watch the two women squinting
against the bright sunlight

RUTH (CONTD)
I wonder if she’1ll fit in

EXT HAILSHAM DAY - DAY 8A
A group of boys in their PE kits run through an outdoor

covered walkway watched by a CCTV camera -

EXT PLAYING FIELDS - DAY 9

- then onto the playing fields watched by

EXT ORNATE GATE - CONTINUOUS 10

a group of girls watching from the shade of a large
ornate gate near the main building

The girls are joined by KATHY and RUTH
LAURA
Ruth Kath Look - they’re
going to set off Tommy
AMANDA
Light blue touch paper and stand
well back
On the playing field we see the boy they are referring to
TOMMY
RUTH
He really doesn’t suspect a
thing
The girls all laugh -
- except KATHY

KATHY watches TOMMY with slight concern

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH pé

KATHY
He’s got his shirt on His
favourite polo shirt

From their vantage point the girls can now see the boys
have started lining up Two CAPTAINS have stepped forward
and are about to start picking teams

One of the two captains is ARTHUR a sporty boy who feels
as Alpha male as Tommy feels Delta

The CAPTAINS start choosing team members TOMMY stands -
almost a comical figure puffing out his chest in order to
make himself stand out

The other boys are noticeably less keen Chatting or
checking the tightness of their boot laces

Even from a distance we can sense TOMMY’S shift from
bright eagerness to puzzled concern as four boys are
chosen before him
Then five six
RUTH
It’s coming Hold on any
moment now

- Until eventually TOMMY is left standing alone

Realising he hasn’t been picked And isn’t going to be
picked

The boys all start sniggering
RUTH (CONTD)
Seven seconds Six five four

three

And SUDDENLY - before RUTH’S countdown can complete - TOMMY
explodes

Head is thrown back Bright red Shaking Screaming
The BOYS are now laughing openly -

- then start to run away on to the football pitch
Leaving TOMMY alone directing his rage at the clear blue

sky arms and legs oddly rigid

EXT PLAYING FIELDS - CONTINUOUS 11

DELETED

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p7

EXT ORNATE GATE - CONTINUOUS 12

The girls watch a mixture of transfixed and absently
amused by this strange sight

RUTH
I suppose it is a bit cruel the
way they work him up like that
But it’s his own fault If he
learned to keep his cool theyd
leave him alone

RUTH looks to KATHY as if for approval -
- but doesn’t get it
KATHY has stood and is walking away from the gate towards

TOMMY

EXT PLAYING FIELDS - CONTINUOUS 13

KATHY approaches TOMMY who is panting from the exertion of
his tantrum still gazing up at the sky

KATHY puts a hand on TOMMY’S arm -

- and TOMMY recoils violently throwing his arm up
knocking her hand aside and striking the side of her face

The strike is an accident - a reaction of surprise and
confusion more than anger - but TOMMY seems even more
shocked than KATHY by what he has done

A beat

KATHY
Isn’t that your favourite shirt

TOMMY says nothing

KATHY (CONTD)
I just wanted to say you
shouldn’t play football in that
shirt You’ll only cover it in
mud

TOMMY
(mumbling a little
stunned)
So what It’s nothing to do with
you anyway

TOMMY starts to walk away

KATHY watches him go

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH ps

EXT ORNATE GATE - CONTINUOUS 14

KATHY rejoins the girls who are coming out of the
pavilion and make an outraged fuss over her

LAURA
Are you all right Kath

RUTH
I can’t believe he hit you

KATHY
I don’t think he meant to

RUTH
Are you bleeding

KATHY
No

RUTH
He’s an animal That’s what I
think

KATHY doesn’t respond and instead looks back to the
playing field

Where she sees TOMMY -

- standing on the edge of the playing field talking to the
new guardian MISS LUCY

TOMMY and MISS LUCY are too distant for us to hear their

conversation but we can read some of the body language

when MISS LUCY reaches out and touches him lightly on the

shoulder

Whatever MISS LUCY is saying TOMMY is listening intently
RUTH (CONTD)

A mad animal

INT CORRIDOR - DAY 15

Children are lined to enter the MATRON’S office for a
medical examination

The children are neatly lined but chatting and
unconcerned These examinations are completely routine

At the head of the queue are KATHY RUTH and AMANDA

A group of three children exit MATRON’S office followed by
MATRON herself

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH po

MATRON
Next

INT MATRON’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 16

KATHY RUTH and AMANDA are being examined by the MATRON
and two male DOCTORS

The presence of the two DOCTORS and some high-tech pieces
of medical equipment feel unnatural

One of the DOCTORS is listening to RUTH’S chest with a
stethoscope

AMANDA stands in front of the second DOCTOR with her arms
raised The man is using his hands to feel around her bare
torso as if looking for lump tumours or sensitivities

MATRON is examining KATHY making notes on a clipboard
headed KATHY H

She tilts KATHY’S head to the side frowning slightly at
the slight bruise from where TOMMY accidentally struck her

MATRON
What’s this from

KATHY
(shrugs )
Don’t remember

MATRON
Doctor

The first DOCTOR glances round from RUTH
He peers at KATHY’S bruise critically For a beat or two
longer than would seem appropriate for such a small
contusion
DOCTOR
It’s nothing Just a bump

INT ART ROOM - DAY 17

A group of the Hailsham students are in the ART ROOM
quietly working on paintings and sculptures

In the corner of the room another of their guardians MISS

GERALDINE is helping two of the children mix paint
colours

At her table KATHY works on a sculpture
SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH plo

Meanwhile RUTH pointedly leans over to the table beside
them where TOMMY is working

RUTH
Tommy What are you doing Show
us so we can have a look

KATHY
(quiet to Ruth)
No Ruth Don’t

TOMMY looks up from his drawing and sees a semi-circle of
faces looking back at him

A beat as he returns their gaze
Then he spins the picture round so that it faces them

RUTH
Oh It’s a -
(she feigns uncertainty)
- what is it exactly

AMANDA
I think it must be a dog Is it
a dog Tommy

One of the boys ARTHUR - who had been one of the team-—
pickers from the playing fields - joins in

ARTHUR
It can’t be a dog Its eyes are
too small I think it must be a
kind of rat

AMANDA
Yes That’s it Tommy’s drawn a
rat Ruth do you think Tommy’s
rat will be selected for the
gallery

RUTH
I don’t know Why don’t we ask
Miss Geraldine to come over and
tell us what she thinks

CLOSE UP on TOMMY’S face - flushing

TOMMY
It’s not finished yet

ARTHUR
That’s right You need to draw
the whiskers

TOMMY
It’s not a rat
17A

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH pll
AMANDA
And a longer tail
TOMMY
(voice rising)

Its not a rat

On the other side of the room the raised voice makes MISS
GERALDINE’S head turn

RUTH
(whispers )
Here it comes
The kids goading TOMMY wait expectantly
Then TOMMY speaks
And the calmness has returned to his voice
TOMMY
It’s not a rat
(beat)
It’s an elephant

He spins the picture back to face him and continues to
work on it

RUTH and AMANDA exchange a slightly puzzled glance -

- but let it go because MISS GERALDINE is now walking over
to their table

- and the kids return to their respective works

INT MISS LUCY’S STUDY - DAY 17A

In her small study MISS LUCY is writing at her desk
KATHY appears in the doorway

MISS LUCY seems unaware

KATHY
Miss Lucy
MISS LUCY looks up
Then smiles
MISS LUCY
Hello
KATHY

Kathy Kathy H
SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH

MISS LUCY
Yes of course Kathy H Come
in

KATHY takes a step into MISS LUCY’S office

MISS LUCY (CONTD)
What can I do for you

KATHY
I was wondering what you said to
Tommy

MISS LUCY doesn’t seem to follow Perhaps having to
remember exactly who TOMMY is

MISS LUCY
I’m sorry

KATHY
You said something to Tommy Out
on the playing fields And
whatever it was it’s had quite
an effect on him

MISS LUCY
I see

Bemused but seeing the seriousness in KATHY’S face
LUCY makes an effort to be precise

MISS LUCY (CONTD)
So - what was it I said I
believe I was trying to calm him
down because he seemed so upset
And he explained that he was
often teased about things like
sport and art So I told him
that he shouldn’t get upset at
these things The other children
are only teasing him to get a
reaction

(beat)

And if it happens that he isn’t
particularly good at sport or
art well - it doesn’t matter
It’s not so important

KATHY frowns

KATHY
Not so important

p12

MISS

MISS LUCY shrugs almost as if to shrug off the intense

gaze of the little girl in front of her

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p13

MISS LUCY
No Not really
INT REFECTORY - DAY 18
Lunch in Hailsham’s refectory

Trays contain compartments filled with extremely overcooked
food Grey meat and faded vegetables

The kids take the trays from the food trolleys then take
seats at long refectory tables

KATHY is carrying her tray with RUTH AMANDA and LAURA
She sees TOMMY
As the other girls move forwards with their trays

KATHY hangs back

INT REFECTORY - DAY 19

TOMMY sits at a table with a few spaces around him
We can sense he is used to eating alone

Not least from the surprise in his face when he looks up
and sees KATHY taking the seat opposite him

TOMMY
Kathy
(awkward)
Aren’t you sitting with the
girls

KATHY looks around as if half expecting to find the girls
either side of her

Then she looks back at TOMMY

KATHY
I just checked and I’m pretty
sure I’m not sitting with the
girls I’m sitting with you

TOMMY smiles

TOMMY
I wanted to say I was sorry I
didn’t mean to hit you when -
(he breaks off)
I mean I wouldn’t want to hit
any girl But particularly not
you
SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p14

KATHY
Well It was an accident that’s
all

A passing guardian MISS GERALDINE glances at TOMMY’S
plate

At the collection of over-boiled carrots not eaten as yet

MISS GERALDINE
Tommy Finish those vegetables

MISS GERALDINE moves on
KATHY leaves a calculated pause
KATHY
So you didn’t lose your temper
when they were teasing you
earlier In the art room
TOMMY nods seriously
TOMMY

I’m not going to get angry like
that any more

KATHY
Because of what Miss Lucy told
you
TOMMY
You notice everything don’t you
Kath
KATHY
I’m nosy
TOMMY
(smiles)

You are

AT THIS MOMENT the seats immediately beside TOMMY and
KATHY are taken by some kids coming over with their trays

About to reply TOMMY seems to think the better of it -
apparently uncomfortable about their conversation being
overheard

TOMMY (CONTD)
Why don’t we talk about it at the
pond

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p15

EXT POND - DAY 20

At the back of Hailsham tucked away in the grounds is a
large pond surrounded by bulrushes and over-hanging trees

Hailsham is reflected in the water
It’s quiet Feels private
TOMMY sits on a large flat rock with KATHY beside him

KATHY
She can’t actually mean that
being creative isn’t important
can she

TOMMY
That’s exactly what she meant
She said some children are good
at things and some aren’t So
if I wasn’t creative there was
nothing wrong with it

KATHY
But what about the gallery If
being creative isn’t important
then why have a gallery at all

TOMMY

I don’t know

(beat)
The funny thing is even though I
don’t understand what she’s
saying it helps I’ve stopped
feeling so angry about things
because -

(shrugs )
- whatever I’m doing wrong or
doing worse than the rest of you
it isn’t my fault

Beat

TOMMY (CONTD)
I think this shouldn’t be spread
okay It’s not the kind of thing
that should get around because
Miss Lucy is a new guardian

KATHY
Yes

From the litter and detritus are collected at the edge of
the pond CUT TO -

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH pl6é

INT THEATRE - DAY 21

- a scene from an anonymous film Black and white from
the thirties forties or fifties The scene is a caperish
moment of chase or slapstick

which is being watched with delight by KATHY TOMMY
RUTH ARTHUR LAURA and all other students in their year

As the moment of slapstick resolves the kids all shout

STUDENTS
Again again

The scene is rewound and begins again

INT CORRIDOR - DAY 22

We follow MISS GERALDINE down a corridor

MISS GERALDINE is carrying a large stack of papers -
drawings and paintings by the students from the artroom

INT OUTSIDE BILLIARD ROOM - CONTINUOUS 23

MISS GERALDINE carries the artworks into the billiard room
where we glimpse MISS EMILY and two other GUARDIANS

One of the GUARDIANS closes the door behind MISS
GERALDINE

on KATHY and RUTH who are in the corridor outside

INT HAILSHAM - CONTINUOUS 24

We now follow KATHY and RUTH as they run through the
school

INT HAILSHAMBACK DOOR - CONTINUOUS 25

As they run out the back door they hold out their wrists
to swipe their metal bracelets against a featureless metal
box attached to the wall

The metal box gives an electronic bleep in acknowledgment

EXT HAILSHAM - CONTINUOUS 26

KATHY and RUTH continue running heading around the side of
the building
SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH pl7

then up onto a low flower-bed wall which allows them
to peer through the window of the billiard room

Where they can see MISS EMILY MISS GERALDINE and two
others GUARDIANS

They are laying out paintings drawing and sculptures on
tables and easels

Through the glass we can faintly hear MISS EMILY

MISS EMILY
Put these two together Yes
perfect I think she’1ll find
this one very interesting

RUTH

(quiet to Kathy)
Madame is coming

EXT HAILSHAM - NIGHT

INT GIRLS’ BATHROOM - NIGHT

DELETED

INT OUTSIDE GIRLS’ DORMITORY - CONTINUOUS

DELETED

INT GIRLS’ DORMITORY - NIGHT

Rows of beds in the girls’ dormitory

Beside each bed a beside table And on each bedside
table a COLLECTION

KATHY’S collection mainly consists of books and RUTH’S
collection is model horses

KATHY is lying in her bed looking at the ceiling
Thinking

After a couple of moments she looks to her side
In the next bed is RUTH whose eyes are closed

KATHY
Ruth
SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH

No response

KATHY (CONT’D)
Ruth Are you awake

RUTH
No I’m asleep And this is the
dream I’m having

KATHY
Why do you think Madame comes and
takes our artwork What’s it for
exactly

RUTH’S eyes open

RUTH
It’s for the Gallery

KATHY
But that’s what I mean She
comes here - what twice a year -
and selects our best pictures and

sculptures and poems And takes

them away
(beat)

She must have stacks of art by

now I asked Miss Geraldine once

how long Madame’s been coming

here and she said for as long as

Hailsham’s existed

KATHY rolls over to face RUTH

KATHY (CONTD)

So what is this Gallery

And why

would she have a gallery of

things done by us

RUTH

Maybe she sells them Outside

out there they sell everything

KATHY
Maybe

pls

A moment of silence as both KATHY and RUTH contemplate

these thoughts
Then

RUTH
She’s scared of us

KATHY frowns and props herself up

in bed

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH

KATHY
Madame

RUTH
Yes

KATHY

That’s a strange thing to say

RUTH shrugs

Beat

Beat

RUTH
I used to think she was just
snooty but now I know different

KATHY
I don’t understand How could
Madame be scared of us What
could we do to her

RUTH
I don’t know I don’t think we
could do anything But I’ve been
remembering her last visit

KATHY
And

RUTH
I don’t know Little things
The way she looks at us

RUTH (CONTD)
She’s scared all right

RUTH (CONTD)
I bet I could prove it

KATHY
- How

EXT HAILSHAM - DAY

We watch as from a distance a lone car approaches

pl9

Hailsham along a ribbon of road through the surrounding

fields

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p20

INT WINDOW - DAY 32

KATHY RUTH AMANDA LAURA and the five other girls stand
in the shadows of Hailsham’s front doorway watching the

CAR approach

EXT DRIVEWAY - DAY 33

The car pulls up on the gravel courtyard of Hailsham and
parks

The driver MADAME exits the car then goes around to the
boot -

- which she opens

Inside is her luggage - a small overnight bag
She takes it out closes the boot then turns -
- and STARTS

Because surrounding her in a tight circle are the nine
girls

There are standing several feet away not moving Just
looking at MADAME

A beat Frozen and uncertain for MADAME
Then she starts to walk

And almost as soon as she does so -

- the children start to walk too

Moving straight for her Making her stop again in her
tracks and hold the overnight bag to her chest

In a slightly stiff glazed way the girls each murmur
dream-like -

GIRLS
Excuse me miss

- as they pass her
Then they separate each walking in different directions
leaving MADAME alone

It’s a very odd moment Surreal But it reveals exactly
what RUTH said it would

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p21

MADAME’S reaction was as if she was suppressing a shudder
A kind of dread in her eyes looking at the children as if
they were spiders

As she was afraid they might reach out and touch her

EXT HAILSHAM - DAY 34
Around the side of the building the girls reconvene

One of the girls LAURA looks particularly shaken and
close to tears

RUTH
You saw it didn’t you In her
face You all saw it

AMANDA
Yes

RUTH
There’s no doubt Kathy

KATHY
(confirms )
No doubt
LAURA
If she doesn’t like us why does
she want our artwork Why
doesn’t she just leave us alone
The response from the others is silence

There seems to be no answer to these questions

INT GIRLS’ DORM - DAY 35

KATHY is alone gazing at herself in a wall-length mirror

Over this we start to hear the Hailsham school song

INT ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY 36

The school song leads us to the main hall where it is
being sung by the students of Hailsham who stand in rows
for morning assembly There are about eighty of them of
ages ranging from five to eighteen

Two younger children are whispering until they are silenced
by a frown from the head guardian MISS EMILY

When the song has finished MISS EMILY prepares to address
them from a lectern on a raised stage
SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p22

Behind her the other guardians stands and among them is
MADAME

MISS EMILY
Good morning students

THE STUDENTS
Good morning Miss Emily

MISS EMILY
There are several points of order
today The first is that Madame
Marie-Claude is visiting us
today and will be examining your
works

MISS EMILY turns to acknowledge MADAME who nods in reply

MISS EMILY (CONTD)
We will of course extend her
every curtesy and make her feel
most welcome

MISS EMILY pauses a moment

MISS EMILY (CONTD)
Second point of order It has
come to my attention that three
burned cigarettes were
discovered hidden behind a pot
in the flower garden

MISS LUCY holds up a glass jam jar containing the
offending cigarette butts

MISS EMILY (CONTD)
I know that on occasion students
have seen some of the caretakers
or delivery men smoking
cigarettes But I must
emphasise once again that it is
much much worse for a student of
Hailsham to smoke than anyone
else I should not have to
explain that students of Hailsham
are special Keeping yourselves
well keeping yourselves healthy
inside is of paramount
importance Have I made myself
clear

THE STUDENTS
Yes Miss Emily

MISS EMILY
Good
(beat)
(MORE)

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p23

MISS EMILY (CONTD)
And finally I have a piece of
good news for all students who
have been diligent in collecting
tokens At the end of studies
tomorrow there will be a sale

This piece of news creates an immediate buzz of excitement

in the students -
- quietened by MISS EMILY raising a hand

MISS EMILY (CONTD)
The delivery will arrive in the
morning And I was assured by
the van driver that the boxes
would contain

MISS EMILY pauses deliberately raising the STUDENTS’
expectations

MISS EMILY extends the pause then allows a slight smile to

creep into the corner of her mouth

MISS EMILY (CONTD)
-- a bumper crop

The assembly hall erupts with the STUDENTS’ cheers

INT THEATRE - LATER

Five students appear to be rehearsing a play watched by
MISS LUCY Among the students on the stage are KATHY
TOMMY and LAURA

Watching from the seats are the rest of KATHY’S year
including RUTH and AMANDA

There are a few props on the stage A table trays
plates All other objects in the rehearsal - cash
register milk sugar - are mimed

KATHY is on one side of the table playing the roll of a
cashier and the others are queuing for the till

LAURA is first in line TOMMY is behind her

KATHY
Good morning ma’am

LAURA
Good morning

KATHY
Can I help you

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p24

LAURA
I wanted two teas Milk in one
tea and milk and sugar in the
other

KATHY
Two teas Right

KATHY turns behind her and mimes pouring milk into two
mugs Then she hands the non-existent mugs to LAURA

LAURA
You forgot the sugar

The students in the seats laugh

KATHY rolls her eyes and mimes adding sugar

LAURA moves on

TOMMY behind LAURA misses his cue to move forwards
MISS LUCY prompts him

MISS LUCY
Tommy

TOMMY snaps to focus steps forwards and blurts
TOMMY
Two teas Milk in one and milk
and sugar in the other
MISS LUCY
No Tommy I want to hear your
own order Don’t simply repeat
the one you just heard
TOMMY looks back MISS LUCY blankly
MISS LUCY (CONTD)
What other kind of drinks do they
serve in cafes

Pause

TOMMY
Water

Some of the kids in the audience laugh
RUTH heckles from the front row

RUTH
A drink you pay for you oaf
SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p25

KATHY
(whispers )
Coffee
TOMMY
(to Miss Lucy)
Coffee

MISS LUCY
So then

TOMMY shoots KATHY a grateful smile
TOMMY
(to Kathy)
Two coffees Milk in one and
milk and sugar in the other
As KATHY mimes the drinks
MISS EMILY (0S)
Once lubrication is established

CUT TO -

38 INT CLASSROOM - DAY 38

- a SKELETON lying on a desk with legs spread

A long wooden RULER is inserted between the legs into what
would be the vaginal opening to the hip bone cavity

The ruler is being held by MISS EMILY

MISS EMILY
The appropriate friction between
penis and vagina should result in
orgasm for both parties

Watching MISS EMILY fascinated but not convulsed in
either amusement or embarrassment is KATHY’S class

MISS EMILY (CONTD)
What constitutes appropriate
friction will vary according to
the physiology of the sexual
partners

MISS EMILY uses her hand to raise the SKELETON’S hips

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p26

MISS EMILY (CONTD)
Here I am illustrating how - by
arching her back or perhaps with
the aid of a pillow - the woman
can arrange herself to create the
precise kind of friction she
requires

MISS EMILY releases the SKELETON’S hips and turns to the
class

MISS EMILY (CONTD)
The various positions and
pleasures of intercourse must not
blind you however to its
inherent dangers You are
already aware of sexually
transmitted diseases which can
wreak havok on otherwise
perfectly healthy bodies

EXT PLAYING FIELDS - DAY 39

- ARTHUR swinging a rounders bat and connecting with the
ball which has been pitched by KATHY

The ball arcs high up into the air towards the outfield
where TOMMY is fielding

KATHY
Catch it Tommy

TOMMY tracks the ball walking backwards looking for the
catch

As it drops down he reaches for it

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p27

And misses it

The ball flies over his head bounces as it hits the
ground and bounces on towards the far perimeter of the
playing field

- where it passes a wire fence only waist high and
comes to rest in the long grass two or three metres
further on

TOMMY approaches the boundary fence He sees the ball but
makes no attempt to reach it

CUT TO -
- MISS LUCY standing with the batting team

The batting team are watching ARTHURS victory lap
cheering

But MISS LUCY her expression unreadable is watching
TOMMY

who now turns from the ball and starts jogging back to

MISS LUCY is watching the girls getting changed from their
whites

After a couple of moments she glances out of the changing
room where down the corridor she can see the FEMALE
GUARDIAN - who seems to be in conversation with a boy who
is out of our line of sight

MISS LUCY looks back to the girls Then with a discretely
enforced casualness asks

MISS LUCY
Why didn’t Tommy get the ball

RUTH and KATHY who are closest to her look up
KATHY notices that MISS LUCY’S hands are trembling

RUTH
Excuse me Miss Lucy
The other girls have now tuned in to this exchange and all

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH

MISS LUCY
Why didn’t Tommy get the ball
When it bounced over the fence
It couldn’t have been far from
him

look at MISS LUCY confused

MISS LUCY

KATHY
The fence is the boundary of the
Hailsham grounds

RUTH
Why take the risk

MISS LUCY
What risk

LAURA
We don’t go outside the boundary
Miss Lucy It’s too dangerous

MISS LUCY
Dangerous

RUTH
There was once a boy who had a
big row with all his friends and
ran off beyond the boundaries
And they found him two days later
in the woods tied to a tree

AMANDA
With his hands and feet cut off

LAURA
Dead

looks shocked

MISS LUCY
And when was this supposed to
have happened

Before Miss Emily

And when she tried to get back
she wasn’t allowed But she kept
hanging around outside pleading
and they still wouldn’t let her
in And then she starved out
there right by the gates

Everybody knows them

MISS LUCY

Behind a line of GIRLS wait to take their morning cocktail

EXT HAILSHAM - MORNING 45

By the front entrance a delivery truck has pulled up on

From the back two DELIVERY MEN in overalls are unloading

Various kids are watching them intensely curious but
keeping an appropriate distance

Among the kids are KATHY RUTH and TOMMY

One of the younger kids a GIRL about eight or nine years
old calls to one of the DELIVERY MEN

INT HAILSHAM - DAY 46

A school bell is ringing

Over the ringing we can hear exited shouts and laughter

INT SCHOOL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 47

We pick up KATHY running down a corridor in Hailsham -
- being tugged along by RUTH’S hand

And we see that they are at the head of a large group of
children who are also running

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p33
and being joined by other children streaming out of
classrooms and side corridors
TOMMY is ahead of them
We lose KATHY and RUTH and TOMMY in the mass of kids
and track the mass of children through the school
Out of the CORRIDOR
Up the STAIRS
Along another CORRIDOR

Until they explode into the -

INT SALE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 48

- SALE ROOM where the SALE is now underway

The refectory tables double as stalls with the sale items
laid out along them

The oldest children work as monitors standing behind the
tables exchanging tokens for goods and keeping their
highly excited young customers under control

We TRACK ALONG one refectory table seeing the excited
faces and grabbing hands of the kids on the other side as
they pick the sale items up searching for the best stuff
at the best prices

And we finally see the sale items themselves -

- which reveal themselves to be the kind of things one
might find in a junk shop or a car-boot sale

Nothing new nothing complete Toys out of the their
boxes Watches with no clasp on the strap The top half
of a track-suit Football boots without laces

Among the kids we see the faces of children we have
already met including RUTH TOMMY ARTHUR LAURA and
AMANDA

We pick up TOMMY who has found something but we can’t see
what it is

He pays a GUARDIAN in tokens

To the side another GUARDIAN notes down on a clipboard
what the kids are purchasing

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p34

INT SALE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

We pick up KATHY at the back of the throng gazing at MISS

LUCY

There is a frozen quality to MISS LUCY’S expression

MISS LUCY is seeing what we are seeing - that the objects

of the children’s enthusiasm are worthless

In front of MISS LUCY we catch two of the children having

a slightly giddy exchange ARTHUR has found a book on
ACTING TECHNIQUES OF THE STAGE AND SCREEN

ARTHUR
Acting Techniques of the Stage
and Screen It’s all the tricks
of the trade

LAURA
It’s perfect Everyone knows
you’re a natural for acting

ARTHUR
If I was really serious about it
I’d have to go to America to have

KATHY watches MISS LUCY for a moment Hearing the
conversation

Then turns and starts moving away from the tables not
towards them

INT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

KATHY sits in the corridor outside the sale room where
chairs have been stacked to make room

She chooses one and sits
A moment
Then

TOMMY
Hey

KATHY turns and sees TOMMY beside her

TOMMY (CONTD)
Aren’t you buying If you’ve
already spent all your tokens
you can have some of mine

What’s the matter Kath Ever
since our conversation the other
day you’ve been a bit out of

KATHY considers this a moment

And her gaze catches sight of MISS LUCY talking to MISS
GERALDINE on the other side of the hall

A short silence
TOMMY (CONT’D)
Well anyway It doesn’t matter
if you can’t find anything in the
sale -
TOMMY reaches into his pocket
TOMMY (CONT’D)
- because I already found
something for you
He produces a CASSETTE TAPE
On the cover it reads Songs After Dark by Judy
Bridgewater The cover shows a woman presumably the
singer wearing an off-the-shoulder purple satin dress
There are palm trees behind her and a black waiter ina
white tuxedo is bringing her a drink
A cigarette burns in her hand

it’s much good or anything

KATHY leans forwards and gives TOMMY a kiss on the cheek

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p36
KATHY
Thank you
From the expression on TOMMY’S face this was clearly worth
the tokens
INT GIRLS’ DORMITORY - SUNSET 50
KATHY is alone in the girls’ dormitory

Outside the window the light is a deep yellow from sunset
and it bathes the room

Dust motes hang in light shafts

KATHY has the tape that TOMMY gave her and she is
inserting into a CASSETTE PLAYER that the girls in that
room share

She presses PLAY -

- and a song starts

It’s a slow ballad The singer Judy Bridgewater is
American

KATHY is immediately transported by the sound

She reacts as if it is the saddest most beautiful song she
has ever heard

As the song moves into its second verse KATHY picks up a
small pillow from one of the beds and holds it close to
her chest as she starts to sway in time to the music

By the time the second chorus comes around she has learned
the melody and picked up the repeating lyric of the
chorus Baby never let me go

Her eyes close and she starts to mouth these words

until the short song is over

As the noise from the cassette player returns to the hiss
between music tracks KATHY opens her eyes as if waking

from a dream -

- to find herself looking at MADAME framed in the doorway
of the dormitory

Both KATHY and MADAME are frozen in the act of seeing each
other

But whereas KATHY’S expression is simple surprise MADAME
has tears pouring down her face

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p37

In fact she is sobbing
A beat later MADAME turns quickly and leaves

And her hurried footsteps disappear down the corridor

In the back are six Hailsham students now aged eighteen
Among them KATHY RUTH and TOMMY
KATHY and TOMMY we have seen before in adult incarnation
at the start of the film RUTH we recognise by the colour
of her hair

and by the way her hand is enmeshed in TOMMY’S

buildings can be seen

We called them the Cottages

EXT THE COTTAGES - DAY 63

A small collection of farm buildings with a central house
are nestled in remote countryside

But it is not picturesque It is desolate Old farm
machinery lies where it was last used A couple of
chickens run through the muddy space between the buildings

KATHY (VO)
At the time we thought the
Cottages were just a staging post
before the donation centers

A MINIBUS pulls up outside and the students get out each
carrying a rucksack and a suitcase

They all look slightly taken aback by what they see
KEFFERS directs them unceremoniously to the main house

KATHY (VO) (CONTD)
But looking back I can see they
were actually a training ground
of sorts During our time there
some of us would be expected to
volunteer as carers

As the students walk to the house they have to pick their
way across the mud Their shoes are unsuitable Their
clothing looks insufficient for the cold

Standing in the doorway of the main house is a girl
Slightly older She wears a heavy jumper and Wellington
boots This is CHRISSIE

CHRISSIE watches them blankly as they approach

Entering the room is RODNEY CHRISSIE’S boyfriend

As he walks behind CHRISSIE he gives her shoulder a little
squeeze Then sits beside her and she slips her arm into
his As a gesture it is clingy As a rule whenever
RODNEY and CHRISSIE are near each other they hold each
other in such a way

All of them have slightly glazed expressions -

- because they are watching the TV which is showing a
generic American sitcom circa early nineties

In the background other inhabitants of the Cottages come
and go On the floor are empty plates of food presumably
from a dinner eaten in front of the television

Manages to keep the box of groceries upright

But when he rises his leg is caked with mud He looks

Also at the table are two other young people One reads a
book and the other eats cereal while reading the back of
the cereal packet

KATHY is eating cereal too and has an open book in front
of her

but is tuned-in to RUTH and CHRISSIE’S conversation

RUTH
I’m not even saying I’1l apply to
be a carer Just several people
have told me I’d be good at it
But then Laura went around
telling people that I had been
saying I was the most likely to
get selected

CHRISSIE rolls her eyes

INT KITCHEN - LATER 70

The kitchen is now empty apart from KATHY and RUTH who
stand at the sink washing up

While KATHY washes RUTH dries
For a while they do this in silence
Then KATHY speaks

KATHY
Ruth I’ve been meaning to ask
you Why do you do that thing -
squeezing Tommy’s shoulder
whenever you pass him

RUTH looks slightly confused

arent I

fight back

So she shrugs

RUTH
So what It’s no big deal A
lot of us do it

KATHY
What you mean is Chrissie and
Rod do it

And now the anger on RUTH’S face becomes for a flashed
moment triumph

Which she quickly shifts into concern

RUTH
Oh Kathy So that’s what this
is about It must be awful for
you surrounded by all these
couples

KATHY
(hotly)
I never said that I’m just
saying it’s daft you copy what
they do and they copy the TV
show

RUTH
But I’m right aren’t I And you
don’t like the fact that Tommy
and I are friends with Chrissie
and Rod Whereas you hardly talk
to anyone

EXT FIELD - DAY 71

In a field adjacent to the farm buildings a car is driving

Through the windscreen we can see CHRISSIE behind the
wheel

RODNEY is beside her

The car stalls as CHRISSIE grinds the gears viciously
Then it stops

CHRISSIE restarts the engine puts the car in gear -

- and almost immediately lurches and stalls again
CHRISSIE bursts into tears

Although the intensity of her reaction might simply be her

frustration at learning to drive it feels somehow more
than that

KATHY is standing at the rear of the main farmhouse
holding a full rubbish-sack

KATHY is absorbed in what she is doing

And doesn’t notice at first that someone else has entered
the barn and is watching her

But she senses the presence

She tenses and looks up

And sees TOMMY

TOMMY smiles a little sheepishly

KATHY looks up at TOMMY again -

- and finds him returning her gaze with a serious
expression

TOMMY (CONTD)
Kath - what are you looking for

KATHY
What do you mean I’m just
looking at dirty pictures

TOMMY
Just for kicks

KATHY
I suppose you could say that

TOMMY sits beside KATHY

TOMMY
Kath you don’t -
(breaks off)
If it’s for kicks you don’t do
it like that You have to look
at the pictures more carefully
Nothing really happens if you go

that fast

KATHY
How do you know what works for
girls

TOMMY
Kath You aren’t looking for
kicks

KATHY stands abruptly and drops the magazine into TOMMY’S
hands

KATHY
Here Give it to Ruth See if
they do anything for her

She exits

TOMMY watches her go

INT KATHY’S ROOM - DAY

KATHY is reading on her bed

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p53

RUTH enters

RUTH
Hi
KATHY
Hi
RUTH sits on the bed
RUTH

I suppose you’ve heard what
Chrissie and Rod have been
saying

KATHY puts her book down bristling slightly - thinking
that this conversation will relate to their earlier
exchange and that in some way RUTH is going to rub KATHY’S
nose in her friendship with the older couple

KATHY
No I haven’t

RUTH
They’re probably just having me
on Their idea of a joke
Forget I mentioned it

KATHY
You obviously want to tell me

Beat

RUTH
You know that Rod and Chrissie
have been thinking of applying to
be carers So they’ve been
learning to drive

KATHY
Yes

RUTH

Well - last weekend Rod and
Chrissie went for a drive
together and they went up to a
town on the Norfolk coast

(beat)
And they think they saw this
person

KATHY
What person

RUTH
A lady Working in an open-plan
office And
SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH po4

RUTH glances at KATHY and suddenly KATHY sees how
vulnerable and anxious RUTH looks

KATHY sits up concerned their earlier spat forgotten

KATHY
What is it Ruth

RUTH
I’m sure it’s not true Ora
mistake But - they thought this
person was a ‘possible’
(beat)
For me

KATHY looks genuinely amazed

KATHY
They found your original

RUTH
They aren’t sure obviously But
Rodney said the resemblance was
really striking

KATHY sits beside RUTH on the bed

KATHY
My God Ruth

RUTH
I know

KATHY
What are you going to do

RUTH
Rod and Chrissie want to drive me
back up there so I can see for
myself Tommy will come but
I feel nervous

KATHY
Do you want me to come too

This is clearly what RUTH was hoping for
KATHY takes RUTH’S hand
KATHY (CONTD)

RUTH
Quite a lot

TOMMY
No we havent

RUTH
We did a lot of role-playing
exercises in Hailsham

TOMMY
They don’t count

RODNEY and CHRISSIE exchange a glance
RODNEY

Okay Well don’t feel scared
There’s really nothing to it

RUTH
We aren’t scared
RODNEY

77 INT CAFE - DAY 77

KATHY RUTH TOMMY RODNEY and CHRISSIE all sit around a
table in a small seaside cafe for lunch looking at a menu

A WAITRESS is taking their order

As she waits for them to make up their minds we see the
WAITRESS reacts slightly to the sight of the bracelets
Not unlike MADAME but perhaps better repressed A frozen
quality in her gaze that betrays the inward shudder

RODNEY
Ill get sausage egg and chips

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH

p56

The WAITRESS nods and turns to TOMMY - who looks slightly
panicked as if confronted with an elaborate menu at an
intimidating French restaurant So he defaults to RODNEY’S

order

TOMMY
Sausage egg and chips please

RUTH
Yes Sausage egg and chips
KATHY
Sausage egg and chips for me
too
CHRISSIE laughs
CHRISSIE
I suppose I’d better get the
same
WAITRESS

Right Five sausage egg and
chips Drinks

A beat
Then KATHY RUTH and TOMMY all look to RODNEY
RODNEY

Five cokes please

INT CAFE - LATER

The five of them eat their lunch

shore line just outside the window

They are eating in silence

Then CHRISSIE shoots a glance at RODNEY who nods
imperceptibly

KATHY sees it

CHRISSIE
You know there’s something I’ve
been wanting to talk to you lot
about The problem is that back
there at the Cottages it’s
impossible Someone is always
listening in

The cokes are circa 1970s bottles of cheap Corona Cola

TOMMY seems distracted by the sight of the sea and the

almost

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p57

Something about CHRISSIE’S tone feels a little over-casual
Again KATHY notices this - and also the way RODNEY has
leaned forwards and is now watching RUTH closely

CHRISSIE (CONTD)
So - it was just something we had
heard about Hailsham students
Someone was saying that some
Hailsham students in the past
had managed to get a deferral
Apparently those Hailsham
students could have their first
donation put back by three or
even four years

(beat)

As long as they qualified

CHRISSIE pauses and checks the faces of KATHY TOMMY and
RUTH for any clue that they know what she is talking
about

RODNEY
If there was a boy and a girl
and they were in love with each
other - really properly in love
and you could prove it - then you
would be given a few years
together before you began your
donations

TOMMY is frowning Clearly this story is news to him

TOMMY
Where did you hear about this

RODNEY
When we were at White Mansion

CHRISSIE
People there used to go on about
this Hailsham couple And when
the guy was only a few weeks from
donation he just went to see
someone He applied And
everything got sorted out

RODNEY
They got three years straight
Three years together just to
themselves Because they could
prove they were properly in love

Beat

CHRISSIE
I suppose -

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p58

CHRISSIE can no longer maintain the enforced casualness of
her voice

CHRISSIE (CONTD)
- you lot would know about that
Being from Hailsham You’d know
the rules about that sort of
thing

RODNEY
Who is it you go to Who would
you talk to if you wanted to

apply
Silence
Until it is broken by TOMMY

TOMMY
To be honest I don’t know what
youre talking about

A flash of anger in RODNEY’S face

RODNEY
Oh come on Do you expect us to
believe that Everyone knows
Hailsham is special So what is
it Why keep all these things to
yourself

Another silence
Then KATHY says delicately
KATHY
There were lots of stories in

them turned out to be true

can’t even be sure this is the
right town

RUTH is looking quietly desperate

RUTH
Please do try to remember Rod

RODNEY
I’m doing my best I’m just
saying none of this is looking
very familiar

KATHY walks up to RODNEY and speaks quietly but firmly to
him

KATHY
Rod - I hope you didn’t make up
this possible for Ruth just to
create the opportunity to ask us
about Hailsham

RODNEY
I wasn’t making it up

KATHY
Then I equally hope you are not
failing to find the office as a
punishment for us not knowing
about this deferral scheme

RODNEY
- Of course I’m not

KATHY
Then find the office Now

RODNEY nods clearly a little taken aback by KATHY’S tone

EXT STREET - CONTINUOUS 83

On RODNEYS FACE

RODNEY
Yes

He turns to the others

RODNEY (CONTD)
Yes That’s it

The five of them are looking towards an office building
over the road

The office is glass-fronted and through the window we can
see a large open-plan room with a dozen desks arranged in
irregular L-patterns

Some of the OFFICE WORKERS are moving between the desks
chatting Others have pulled their swivel chairs together
and are drinking coffee or eating sandwiches

The sight of these workers - the sight of these normal
lives unfolding behind the glass - transfixes the five
young adults

KATHY
Do you think it’s their lunch
break
TOMMY

It must be

With KATHY RUTH TOMMY RODNEY and CHRISSIE we watch the
OFFICE WORKERS for a while

The way their mouths move Smiling talking

The way their eyebrows raise or the way they shake they
heads

The way they loosen their ties or roll up their shirt
sleeves

They way they drink their coffee
We are broken out of the moment by RUTH
RUTH
(quiet)
Oh God I think I see her

We see what RUTH sees
SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH pél
A WOMAN about thirty years older than RUTH in her late
forties

And there is a resemblance there Facially and in the way
she has tied her hair

but the resemblance is not striking

RODNEY
Yes That’s her

But it isn’t This woman is not RUTH’S genetic match with
thirty years of age on her And KATHY knows it

The five continue watching the WOMAN for several moments
then one of the other OFFICE WORKERS a MAN notices
the five young adults across the road all staring in at

them

The MAN nudges the WOMAN beside him and gives a slightly
uncertain wave

This gesture breaks the spell over KATHY RUTH TOMMY
RODNEY and CHRISSIE

Then RUTH continues - cold anger growing in her voice

RUTH (CONTD)

And I knew it wouldn’t be her
before we even got there It was
never going to be her They
never ever model us from people
like that woman

KATHY
Ruth - don’t -

But RUTH isn’t going to stop now

RUTH

TOMMY and KATHY follow behind

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT 88
KATHY is cooking bacon over the stove

A couple of other faces from the Cottages are sat at the
kitchen table eating their dinner

Coming from the bedroom we hear the sound of raised
voices

An argument Say

RUTH (0S)
I don’t know why you’d say
something like that Do you
actually want me to get angry

TOMMY (0OS)
Of course I don’t

RUTH (0S)
Then what do you want If you
don’t want to make me angry if
you don’t want me to be upset
why would you say something so
completely stupid

We cant fully make out the words but we can recognise the
voices as RUTH and TOMMY It sounds as if RUTH is doing
most of the shouting

People around the dining table look round at the noise
then exchange glances then go back to whatever they were
doing

e eH

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p64

KATHY slides the BACON out of the frying pan onto two
slices of white bread already buttered then pushes the
two slices together

INT STAIRS - NIGHT 89

KATHY climbs the stairs carrying her bacon sandwich up to

She can hear the argument more clearly here because the

appreciated A little support

KATHY turns and sees TOMMY through the open kitchen
doorway

He’s at the dining table on which is spread out a sheet of

This is a conversation he has internally rehearsed before

TOMMY
Chrissie and Rod are pretty
obsessed with this rumour aren’t
they

KATHY
About the deferrals

TOMMY nods

TOMMY
I was thinking that if this
rumour was true it might explain
quite a lot

KATHY
Such as

TOMMY
Well - the Gallery for instance
We never got to the bottom of it
what the Gallery was for

Beat

TOMMY (CONTD)
Pictures poetry sculptures It
tells you something about
yourself That’s the point about
art isn’t it It says what’s
inside you

KATHY
That’s what they used to tell us
It reveals your soul
Beat

Beat

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH

TOMMY

Exactly Your soul
(beat)

So suppose that the rumour is
true A special arrangement has
been made for Hailsham students
If they’re in love There would
have to be a way to judge if
couples are telling the truth
and not just lying to put off
their donations

TOMMY (CONT’D)
Well that’s what the Gallery
would be for In the Gallery
they can find out everything
about us that they need to know
So if we say we’re in love they
can look into our souls and
they’1l know if it’s real love
or just a lie

KATHY
That’s a strange idea Tommy

TOMMY
Is it I don’t see why it’s
stranger than any other idea

KATHY
- and didn’t Miss Lucy tell you
that making art for the Gallery
wasn’t important

TOMMY
Yes She did But look what
happened to her

I know you think that you and
Tommy would have made a natural

do it right this time

RUTH’S hand reaches out and gently brushes against KATHY’S
hair

Swings her legs out the side of the bed Rises to a

KATHY (VO)
For the most part being a carer
has suited me fine I can handle
the solitude the broken sleep
and the constant shuttle from
clinic to clinic

We see around KATHY’S flat

It is Spartan tidy functional and gives no indication of
a life shared with anyone else

There is a sense that KATHY only uses her flat for eating
an early breakfast or a late dinner and sleeping

lined on a shelf four desk lamps Each a different

bent back to keep its place

KATHY checks over her shoulder then opens the bedside

She sees a wrist-watch and some hair-clips

Then shuts the drawer

Almost as soon as she has done so KATHY hears a noise
The toilet in the bathroom flushes

KATHY turns and a moment later the door to the toilet
opens

Revealing RUTH

She is struggling slightly to exit the bathroom because
she is having to use a walker in order to stay upright and
it’s awkward manoeuvring it past the self-closing door

So for a moment or two she doesn’t notice KATHY

Then she has the walker past the doorframe

And looks up

Then freezes at the sight of KATHY Momentarily stunned
dislocated

here I was planning to stay the

night anyway
EXT DOVER RECOVERY CENTRE - NIGHT 114
Half the windows in the recovery center remain lit through
the night
INT RUTH’S WARD ROOM - DAY 115

The following morning

KATHY is peeling an orange watched by RUTH - who is lying
in her bed propped up on pillows

KATHY pulls the segments neatly apart then hands them to

RUTH

RUTH smiles

RUTH
I knew you’d be a good carer
Your donors are very lucky

KATHY smiles back
A moment

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH

RUTH (CONTD)
Look - I was lying awake last
night and I suddenly had an idea
that we’d take a trip together

KATHY
Where to

RUTH
(casual)
I didn’t much think of where
Just a trip

RUTH (CONTD)
Though a place did occur to me
One of the boys on the next floor
was telling me about it It’s
near the Kingsfield recovery
center

KATHY reacts slightly to the name Kingsfield

Beat

KATHY
Is it the boat The one stranded
on the beach

RUTH
Youre heard about it too

KATHY
From a carer who had worked
there
(beat)
It’s quite a drive from here
Are you sure you’re up to it

RUTH
Quite sure

RUTH (CONTD)
(gently)
And do you suppose if we’re
driving all that way we could
think about calling in on Tommy
Seeing as he’s staying at
Kingsfield

Another beat - then RUTH smiles

RUTH (CONT’D)
I told you I’d been keeping tabs

on both of you

Have you seen him

KATHY
Not since the Cottages

RUTH nods

RUTH
No Neither have I

FADE TO -

EXT GATES - DAY 116

Large automated cast iron gates

A sign reads Kingsfield Recovery Centre

The gates start to swing open and KATHY’S car drives
through

INT CAR - DAY 117
KATHY drives up towards the main building

Outside the front doors there is a group of four people
patients standing and chatting

RUTH makes a sudden sharp intake of breath

RUTH
Look There he is

One of the figures is TOMMY Older hair cut short
thinner But entirely recognisable

He turns to watch the approaching car
RUTH (CONT’D)
Do you think he’s recognised us

through the glass

As if in answer TOMMY lifts his hand as if shielding his
eyes from overhead light and squints at them

This sends RUTH into a slight panic
RUTH (CONTD)
What do we do Do we get out
No no let’s not get out

But KATHY has already opened the door

We stay in the car with RUTH -

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p81
- who watches like a silent film as TOMMY walks towards
KATHY

Then hugs her

EXT KINGSFIELD RECOVERY CENTRE - DAY 118

Now we are with TOMMY and KATHY
- aS KATHY is spun round by TOMMY’S embrace -

- so that she now faces RUTH watching through the car
windscreen

RUTH face is oddly blank almost frozen as if she is
watching people in a play

KATHY
(pulling back)
Ruth’s in the car

TOMMY pulls back from KATHY and goes to open the passenger
door

- and now it is KATHY’S turns to watch through the
windscreen as TOMMY leans in and kisses RUTH on each
cheek

It is a different kind of greeting More restrained And
KATHY can see that

EXT NARROW COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 119

KATHY’S car drives down a narrow winding country road
Almost a dirt-track

INT CAR - CONTINUOUS 120

KATHY drives with RUTH still in the passenger seat and
TOMMY in the back seat

TOMMY
I can’t believe I have the two of
you here Does it feel to you
like we’re back at Hailsham
again Like no time has passed

KATHY
No It doesn’t

TOMMY laughs
SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p82

TOMMY
No it doesn’t at all does it
It feels really weird
(beat)
But good weird

TOMMY laughs again

TOMMY (CONT’D)
So I suppose you both heard that
Hailsham was closed From what
you hear the only schools left
now are like Morningdale Like
battery farms they say

(beat)

I’m sure it’s an exaggeration

RUTH is looking out of the passenger window a little
anxiously as the narrow road gets rougher and more

overgrown
RUTH
Are you sure this is the right
way
KATHY
Yes I’m sure
121 EXT NARROW COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 121

KATHY stops the car

The dirt track has come to an end

KATHY and TOMMY exit the car

RUTH opens her door and peers out

Again we see the same slight panic in RUTH that we saw

when they arrived at Kingsfield and saw TOMMY It is as
if over the intervening years all her power and authority

has gone
RUTH
My walker is going to be useless
here
TOMMY

It’s okay We’1ll carry you

RUTH sees that the way ahead is blocked by a tangled barbed
wire fence
SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p83

RUTH
Oh no No one said anything
about this No one said anything
about barbed wire

TOMMY
Ruth just relax

122 INT FOREST - DAY 122

KATHY and TOMMY carry RUTH with one of her arms around
each of their shoulders

RUTH is not paralysed - she just has very little power in
her legs But the effort for TOMMY and KATHY is
considerable

RUTH
Kath - really are you absolutely
sure -
KATHY snaps slightly
KATHY
Oh do be quiet Ruth I’ve

already told you I’m sure

TOMMY
Yes Ruth For God’s sake

RUTH closes her mouth and sinks a little deeper into
herself

123 EXT SAND DUNES - DAY 123

The three of them exit the forest
into sand dunes
And there a little way ahead of them is a BOAT
An old fishing vessel - sat in the dunes as if ina
snapshot Listing slightly Paint peeling rusting and
rotting
TOMMY
(quiet)
Wow
123A EXT BOAT - DAY 123A
TOMMY has climbed on to the boat Right up to the cabin

He laughs
123B

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p84

Looks back at RUTH and KATHY and waves

KATHY and RUTH are on the banks of the dune that overlooks
the boat

KATHY is standing RUTH is seated

KATHY waves back to TOMMY but RUTH doesn’t appear to see
Apparently lost in her own thoughts

EXT SAND DUNES - DAY 123B

TOMMY and KATHY sit beside RUTH on the dune facing the
boat

TOMMY
Maybe this is what Hailsham looks
like now

Beat

TOMMY (CONTD)
Do you ever hear Kath About
the other students from Hailsham

KATHY
Sometimes

TOMMY
I heard that Amanda completed on
her first donation

RUTH
I think that happens more than
they ever tell us

KATHY
There’s no conspiracy It does
happen sometimes But it’s not
common

TOMMY keeps gazing at the boat

TOMMY

There was a guy at my centre
He always worried he wouldn’t
make it past his first donation
But it all turned out fine He’s
come through his third now and
he’s completely all right

(beat)
It’s funny I don’t think I’d
have been a good carer But ina
way I think I’m a pretty good
donor
SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH ps5

RUTH
Well it’s what we’re supposed to
be doing isn’t it
Silence
Then
RUTH (CONTD)
Id like you both to forgive me
I don’t expect you to

A long silence

None of them look at each other

Then
KATHY
- Forgive you for what
RUTH
Keeping you and Tommy apart
Silence

RUTH (CONT’D)

It should have been you two
together I always knew it as
far back as I can remember But
I kept you apart It wasn’t just
because of the rumours about
deferrals It was because I was
jealous You had real love and
I didn’t And -

RUTH takes a breath This is the truth and it’s hard

RUTH (CONTD)
I didn’t want to be the one that
was left alone

Silence

RUTH (CONTD)

It’s the worst thing I ever did
(beat)

And now I want to put it right

TOMMY
(quiet)
I don’t know how you can do that
Ruth
RUTH

I can If the two of you get a
deferral
SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p86

Tears start running down KATHY’S face and she wipes them
away quickly

KATHY
It’s too late for that Way too
late It’s stupid to even think
about it

RUTH
It’s not too late Tommy You
tell her

TOMMY says nothing

RUTH (CONTD)
Youll see Both of you I
wanted to do this trip because I
had something to give you

RUTH reaches into her pocket and pulls out a crumpled piece
of paper

She hands it to TOMMY
RUTH (CONTD)
It’s Madame’s address That’s
who you apply to That’s who you
have to go and see

TOMMY
- How did you get this

RUTH

It wasn’t easy But I’ve had

years to think about what I did

and years to work out how to make

it better

(beat)
Now it’s up to you two
124 EXT BOAT - DAY 124

A breeze whips up sand around the fishing boat
The tide is coming in lapping around the wood

KATHY TOMMY and RUTH have gone

FADE TO -

125 EXTREME CLOSE UP 125

- of a drawing

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p87
Many thousands of careful pen-strokes build up to depict an
ELEPHANT standing in tall grass

It is oddly similar to the clumsy drawing that TOMMY did as
a child In fact compositionally it is the same

But this drawing shows the opposite of clumsiness If
anything it shows a meticulous care bordering on
obsessive

And there is something strange about the surface of the
elephant It is drawn as if it is reflective or metallic

TOMMY (0S)
What do you think

INT KINGSFIELDTOMMY’S WARD ROOM - NIGHT 126

KATHY sits on the floor of TOMMY’S room in Kingsfield

She is surrounded by more of these intricate black and
white pictures all depicting different animals But the
one she holds is of the elephant

TOMMY

I started doing them when we were
in the Cottages After that trip
to find Ruth’s possible I
realised you see If I was ever
going to apply for a deferral
I’d need something to show them

(beat)
I’ve done hundreds over the
years

KATHY
They’re wonderful

TOMMY
Really I never showed anyone
until now They were my secret
(beat)
Like you reading those porno
magazines

KATHY looks up

KATHY
You remember that

TOMMY
I remember

KATHY
Ruth said you didn’t
understand what I was doing
SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH pss

TOMMY

No I think she didn’t
understand what you were doing
She thought you were looking at
the dirty pictures in order to
find out about sex To find out
what you were missing

(beat)
But I knew you were looking for
your original

Beat

KATHY

I used to get these huge urges to
have sex Sometimes they were so
powerful I thought I’d do it with
anyone

(beat)
So I thought that had to tell me
something Something about what
kind of person I was modelled
from I guessed the magazines
would be the most likely place
Id find her

TOMMY
You know those urges are natural
don’t you Normal We all had
them You know that now

KATHY
Yes I know that now

127 EXT KINGSFIELD RECOVERY CENTRE - NIGHT 127

Through one of the windows we can see TOMMY lying in his

bed and KATHY in the chair beside him reading to him from
a book

128 INT KINGSFIELDTOMMY’S WARD ROOM - CONTINUOUS 128

KATHY is reading from One Thousand And One Nights

KATHY
I embarked on a ship to the city
of El-Basrah with a company of
merchants and we traversed the
sea for many days and nights
Passing island after island sea
to sea land to land In each
place we bought and sold and
exchanged merchandise
128A

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH

KATHY glances at TOMMY as she reads
KATHY (CONTD)
Until we arrived at one island
like the gardens of paradise and
the master of the ship cast
anchor there
KATHY looks round at TOMMY’S face again
TOMMY
(quiet)
Don’t stop
KATHY watches him for a few moments
Then she puts the book down
Stands

And gets into bed

p89

With her eyes never leaving his face her hand slips under

the sheets towards TOMMY

Then she leans forwards and starts to kiss him

A MAN is walking just ahead of her carrying a bunch of
multicoloured balloons

KATHY is fixated on the fist holding the strings

EXT SEAFRONT ROAD - DAY

KATHY is seated on a seafront bench

She watches elderly people making their way down the

promenade

She holds the address RUTH gave her

Her gaze is directed at one house in particular

As she watches in the background a tall Nigerian man -

GEORGE - pushes an old woman on a wheelchair

The old woman is wrapped and sunk into a blanket and

though we do not see her face

EXT KINGSFIELD RECOVERY CENTRE - DAY

KATHY and TOMMY walk around the Kingsfield grounds by a

swimming pool which has been filled-in with concrete

KATHY

I checked the address

(beat)
We just go there Next week
Ill take you for lab tests
I’1l sign you out for the whole
day And we’ll visit Madame on
the way back

TOMMY nods

TOMMY
If we get this - she gives us the
deferral - and she gives us say
three years just to ourselves
what do we do Where will we go

KATHY
I don’t know Maybe they’1ll send
us back to the Cottages

(MORE )

129A

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH pg9l

KATHY (CONTD)
Or maybe they have a separate
place for people like us We’ll
have to wait and see

take the best Maybe six or
seven or them

Yes

INT OPERATING CHAMBER 132

RUTH is strapped to an operating table

She is surrounded by SURGEONS and NURSES who are operating
on her opened torso

Her eyes are open but glazed

RUTH blinks once

The alarm on the heart-rate monitor starts to sound
No one takes any notice

RUTH flatlines

The operation continues unaffected

Concludes

And the various operating staff finish up Scrub down
Exit

Leaving RUTH her cadaver on the operating table Alone

A woman is outside the house weeding large terra-cotta
planters in the front garden

The woman is MADAME

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p92

EXT MADAME’S HOUSE - DAY 134

KATHY and TOMMY approach the front gate
MADAME doesn’t appear to notice them

KATHY

MADAME starts - and looks up Confused

KATHY (CONT’D)
Sorry I didn’t mean to startle
you But we were at Hailsham
I’m Kathy This is Tommy
(beat)
We haven’t come to give you any
trouble

MADAME
From Hailsham
(beat)
If you haven’t come to give me
trouble then why are you here

TOMMY
We came to talk to you I’ve
brought you some things
TOMMY lifts his bag
TOMMY (CONT’D)
Some things you might want for
your Gallery
A long beat as MADAME gazes at them head tilted slightly
Then she nods
MADAME

Very well then Come inside

INT MADAME’S HOUSELIVING ROOM - DAY 135

The inside of the house is dark and MADAME doesn’t switch
on the lights

MADAME ushers TOMMY and KATHY into the living room then
dissapears

The living room was once two rooms with the partition wall
removed now replaced by a sliding screen

The interior is lit by what light filters through the net
curtains
SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p93

It reveals a Victorian living room with period furniture
and a feeling of dust and age

On one wall are two agit-prop posters in support of the
Hailsham movement

Opposite a large watercolour of Hailsham is hung above the
fireplace

TOMMY
Look

He indicates the watercolour to KATHY
They talk quietly

TOMMY (CONT’D)
It’s Hailsham It’s the bit
around the back of the pond

KATHY
What do you mean There’s no
pond here

TOMMY
No the pond’s behind you

KATHY seems slightly taken aback by the irritation in
TOMMYS voice

TOMMY (CONT’D)
You must be able to remember If
you’re round the back with the
pond behind you

KATHY
Yes

Their quiet exchange is silenced by noise on the far side
of the sliding screen MADAME moving about Then the
sliding screen is pulled back

but apparently for no purpose The rear half of the
living room - beyond what was once the partition wall - is
almost completely in shadow

With the screen fully pulled back MADAME enters the lit
area of the room and indicates that they should sit

MADAME takes a seat in an armchair beside the fireplace
and KATHY and TOMMY sit on the sofa opposite

As they get comfortable there is a soft mechanical
whirring sound from the dark half of the living room which
KATHY is distracted by

Then brought back to focus by MADAME
SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p94

MADAME
So

Long beat
Then

TOMMY
We’re in love

TOMMY turns to KATHY Then back to MADAME

TOMMY (CONT’D)
We’re in love True love
Verifiable

KATHY
We would never have bothered you
if we weren’t really sure

MADAME
Verifiable I see
(beat)
Go on

TOMMY
Well wed heard about the
deferrals And we’d worked out
the purpose of the Gallery

MADAME
Tell me the purpose

TOMMY
To use our art from Hailsham to
look into our souls which would
verify that we deserved a
deferral

MADAME does not react

TOMMY (CONTD)
The trouble is I was a bit mixed
up in those days I didn’t
really do any art so you never

took anything I know that’s my
fault and it’s probably much too
late

He reaches down and opens his bag

TOMMY (CONTD)
but I brought some things
with me now

He starts to lay the drawings out on the floor for MADAME
to see
SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p95

TOMMY (CONT’D)
Some were done quite recently
but a lot of them are several
years old so there’s a spread
And you should have Kath’s stuff
already She got plenty into the
Gallery didn’t you Kath

ON KATHY -
- looking at MADAME

She’s a step ahead of TOMMY Realising the mistake that
she and TOMMY have made Perhaps because deep down she
already knew

MADAME
I’m sorry
(beat)
I don’t know what to do at this
point I never know what to do
Should I let them continue or
should I stop them now

Silence

It takes a moment to realise that this question was not
asked to the ether but was directed at someone in
particular

Someone actually in the room who has not yet been
revealed

MADAME (CONTD)
Well

Beat
MADAME (CONTD)
It’s you they’ve really come to

see

VOICE
I suppose it is

The VOICE has come from the darkness at the rear of the
living room

And from that darkness now comes the metallic whirring
again A wheel turning

VOICE (CONTD)
Ill take it from here

A moment later out of the darkness MISS EMILY appears
SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p96

A shrunken figure pushed forwards on a wheelchair by her
nurse GEORGE

MISS EMILY
Leave us George I’11 call when
I’m done

GEORGE turns and goes
A moment between MISS EMILY KATHY and TOMMY
KATHY and TOMMY are frozen with surprise

MISS EMILY (CONTD)
Kathy H and Tommy D I remember
you both Kathy a bright girl
and so creative Tommy a big
heart And terrible rages

TOMMY remains motionless holding one his drawings in his
hand

MISS EMILY (CONTD)
We used to get two or three
couples like you a year But not
so much these days
(beat)
Youre the first for quite a
while

TOMMY still doesn’t quite understand

TOMMY
To apply for a deferral

KATHY
(quiet)
There are no deferrals Tommy

TOMMY looks at KATHY uncomprehending
Then back at MADAME Who gently confirms
MADAME
There are no deferrals And
there never have been
Beat
MISS EMILY
We didn’t have the Gallery in
order to look into your souls
We had the Gallery in order to

see if you had souls at all

In the silence MADAME stands

She goes to the Hailsham watercolour above the fireplace

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p97

and gazes at it a moment

MISS EMILY (CONTD)
Hailsham was the last place to
consider the ethics of donation

We used your art to show what you

were capable of To show that
donor children were all but
human

But it was all a mistake We
were providing an answer to a
question that no one was asking

MISS EMILY glances at MADAME

Then back to TOMMY and KATHY

Beat

MISS EMILY (CONTD)
You have to understand Cancer
used to kill almost everyone
Now it kills no one at all
(beat)
You see it’s not an ethical
issue It’s just about the way
we are If you ask people to
return to darkness the days of
lung cancer and breast cancer
and motor neurone disease
(she shrugs)
they simply say no

MISS EMILY (CONTD)
Do you understand

KATHY
Yes

MADAME turns to TOMMY

MADAME
Your drawings are very good If
you want I’1ll keep them

TOMMY doesn’t answer

He just stares blankly into space

MADAME reacts slightly dreamily as if she has momentarily
lost focus

MADAME
Tell me

KATHY
There was a time you saw me It
was one afternoon in the

else around and I was playing
this tape This music

MADAME smiles distantly

MADAME

I still think about that occasion
from time to time

Then MADAME reaches out and touches KATHY’S cheek
MADAME

INT CAR - EARLY EVENING 137

KATHY and TOMMY drive in silence through countryside back
towards Kingsfield

Shadows are long The countryside is bathed in the last of
the day’s sunlight

Fields line the road on either side

SHOOTING SCRIPT 24TH MARCH p99

TOMMY
Could you stop the car I’m
sorry I need to get out a
minute

KATHY turns to TOMMY but TOMMY is looking directly ahead
his gaze fixed on an indeterminate point

KATHY slows the car pulls over to the side of the road
They stop on a small grass verge

Without saying another word TOMMY gets out of the car and
shuts the door behind him

Leaving KATHY in a little bubble of silence

She watches as TOMMY walks a short way down the road

Then stops caught in the glare of the headlights

Then just as he did as young boy on the playing field -
- he throws his head back and starts to scream at the sky
Insulated from the sound KATHY watches

Then she opens the door
