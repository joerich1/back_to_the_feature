INT RALPH’S APARTMENT- NIGHT

A stereotypical male apartment very nice electronics but it
is not decorated in the slightest no pictures on the walls
very cold

The doorbell rings RALPH tall and dark gets up from his
leather LazyBoy and goes to the door He opens it to see a
MIDDLE-EASTERN MAN with a large briefcase and a fancy frozen
coffee drink Ralph gestures for him to come in and they
make their way to the coffee table

RALPH
Where’s my Pastrami Polish Boy

MIDDLE-EASTERN MAN
They closed down Fertelli’s

RALPH
Oh my God This is the worst thing
that could happen That was the
best sandwich in the world

MIDDLE-EASTERN MAN
No more sandwich shop Starbucks
now

The Middle-Eastern man places the briefcase on the coffee
table Ralph goes to the cabinet under the sink and pulls
out another duffel bag

RALPH
Starbucks is what’s wrong with this
country They’re like the Walmart
of coffee They take the little
guy and they just squeeze him and
squeeze him until there’s nothing
left but overpriced coffee beans
(re Middle-Eastern man’s
drink)
What the fuck is that even supposed
to be

MIDDLE-EASTERN MAN
Venti non-fat caramel Frappuccino
with whipped cream Take a sip

RALPH
No when I want a cup of coffee I
want a cup of coffee Not an ice
cream sundae
MIDDLE-EASTERN MAN
Just try it It’s good

Ralph takes a sip

RALPH
Damn that is good Are you going
to drink the rest of that

The Middle-Eastern man takes the duffel bag from Ralph

MIDDLE-EASTERN MAN
Yes See you next month

The Middle-eastern man turns around and exits Ralph turns

off the television and flips on “Sweet Emotion” by Aerosmith
He takes out a three beam scale measuring cups baggies and
a knife He opens the briefcase It is filled with cocaine

Ralph raises the knife and cuts into one of the blocks of
coke when the door is kicked open and four GUNMEN (20s) burst
into the room immediately surrounding Ralph

GUNMAN 1
Get on the fucking ground

RALPH
You stupid cowboys

GUNMAN 1
Shut the fuck up

RALPH
Do you know who this belongs to
Do you know who the fuck I am

GUNMAN 1
Some dead guy

Gunman 1 shoots Ralph in the head with a shotgun Ralph
falls to the ground dead Gunman 1 closes the briefcase and
picks it up The three other gunmen follow their leader out
of the apartment

INT DONUT SHOP- THE NEXT MORNING

The shop is empty aside from BENNY BONNEMA (white dark hair
skinny 30s) pouring gasoline throughout the inside of the
store His partner THE RUSSIAN (late 30s 6’4” massive)
stands and watches as he prepares a Molotov cocktail
BENNY
I can’t believe they rolled Ralph

THE RUSSIAN
Da

BENNY
I liked Ralph

THE RUSSIAN
They got Kadakian’s entire re-up
20 kilos

BENNY
Fuck Why didn’t we roll Ralph

THE RUSSIAN
Kadakian is offering 100k to kill
the cowboys and get the coke back

BENNY
That’s the kind of jobs we should
be doing Instead we’re doing a
five grand burn job on a fucking
donut shop Why are we even doing
this

THE RUSSIAN
Because donut maker won’t sell
property to Pascalli

Benny picks up a donut out of the display case and takes a
bite

BENNY
I know that I mean why are WE
doing this bullshit job We’re the
best contract killers in Brooklyn
and we’re killing fucking
bearclaws

Benny throws the donut onto the ground

THE RUSSIAN
That is cruller

Benny shoots him a look

THE RUSSIAN (CONTD)
Why couldn’t we take Cleveland job
BENNY
Cuz I fucking hate Cleveland And
I’m tired of having to drive eight
hours to make any real money
We’re independent contractors We
should be contracting
independently not waiting around
for whatever scraps Pascalli feels
like throwing our way

THE RUSSIAN
Then we take the Kadakian job

The Russian pulls a cigarette out of a pack and starts to dig
in his pockets for a lighter Benny takes the cigarette from
his mouth and throws it on the ground

BENNY
That’s just stupid

THE RUSSIAN
Why

Benny throws his empty gasoline canister across the room

BENNY
What is this your first day
Kadakian hates us Right off the
top of my head I can think three
of his guys- four of his guys- that
weve clipped

THE RUSSIAN
Kadakian wants us for this job

BENNY
Says who

Benny takes a hammer out of his pocket and begins to smash
the sprinklers off the ceiling

THE RUSSIAN
Kadakian

Benny stops what he’s doing and turns around

BENNY
Okay first of all you lead off
with that “Leader of the Armenian

Mafia wants us for a 100000 job”
That’s your headline Second of
all NO
THE RUSSIAN
Why not

BENNY
Kadakian is the head of the rival
family We work for Pascalli

Benny goes back to destroying the sprinklers

THE RUSSIAN
I thought we were independent
contractors

BENNY
Yeah but it’s an unwritten rule
You don’t work for both families

THE RUSSIAN
It’s a gray area

BENNY
I don’t want to get shot in the
fucking face over a gray area
Plus Pascalli is probably the one
who rolled Ralph in the first
place

THE RUSSIAN
Kadakian says it’s not Pascalli

BENNY
(Sarcastic)
Oh Well if Kadakian says so-

Benny destroys the last of the sprinklers

THE RUSSIAN
We ask Pascalli If Pascalli says
he didn’t do job we do job

Benny grabs a pink donut box and puts a couple of bearclaws
in it
BENNY
Even if Pascalli didn’t do it he

might kill us for working for
Kadakian regardless
THE RUSSIAN
I am not afraid of Pascalli If
Pascalli make move on me I take
gun away from him and I shove it up
his big fat Italian ass

The Russian shoves a cloth into the Molotov cocktail

BENNY
Okay but they would kill me

THE RUSSIAN
Are you contract killer or faggot

BENNY
I’m not a fucking faggot and I’m
tired of you calling me that every
time I don’t want to take a
bullshit job

THE RUSSIAN
Job is not bullshit It is easy
Kadakian knows who did it He has
address All we have to do is get
the coke back and make an example
We don’t even have to dispose of
the bodies Tomorrow morning we
have one hundred thousand dollars

BENNY
A hundred thousand spacebucksby
tomorrow

THE RUSSIAN
What is a “spacebuck”

BENNY
Never mind

As they stand at the exit Benny grabs the Molotov cocktail
from The Russian lights it and throws it into the room as
the two walk out the door The entire shop bursts into
flames

INT PASCALLI’S BAR- LATER THAT MORNING
Benny and The Russian walk in to the bar Most of the chairs

are still on the tables This place isn’t even close to
opening
SALVATORE PASCALLI sits at a booth in the back of the bar
drinking a glass of wine His four cronies FREDDY BILLY
GINO and NICKY sit with him Four BODYGUARDS provide
protection Benny and The Russian make their way to
Pascalli’s booth Benny grabs a chair and sits down

THE RUSSIAN
(To Gino)
Get up

Gino gets up and grabs a chair to sit in The Russian sits
down in Gino’s spot

PASCALLI
Howd it go

THE RUSSIAN
It burned

Benny tosses a small pink box on the table Pascalli opens
the box

PASCALLI
I asked you for a bearclaw Benny
This is a fucking crueller

THE RUSSIAN
(To Benny)
I told you
(To Pascalli)
Where is payment

PASCALLI
Relax you just sat down Do you
want a drink first

THE RUSSIAN
Money first

PASCALLI
Fine Here

Pascalli pulls out a thick envelope and places it on the
table The Russian grabs the envelope and places it in his
jacket pocket

THE RUSSIAN
(To Billy)
Stoli Double

Billy gets up and heads to the bar
BENNY
No I’m fine thanks
(Pause)
So Sal what’s up Any news

got hit

BENNY

Spiezioli for three weeks

THE RUSSIAN
That negro owes me 20000

BENNY
He’s taken all the contracts
Where the fuck did this guy even
come from

Billy comes back with the drink for The Russian and puts
down

NICKY
Nobody knows anything about him

BENNY
What do you mean nobody knows

NICKY
Forget it Dutch he’s a fucking
ghost He’s a superhero like
Batman or some shit

FREDDY
I heard he’s a Navy Seal

THE RUSSIAN
If that Batman wants to come after
me I will show him my Kryptonite

Everyone stares at The Russian
THE RUSSIAN (CONTD)
What

BENNY
That’s Superman It’s Superman who
gets killed by Kryptonite

Everyone laughs

FREDDY
I don’t know what you guys did in
Russia-

The Russian grabs the back of Freddy’s head and slams it onto
the table giving him a bloody nose The Russian holds
Freddy’s head down on the table

THE RUSSIAN
In Russia when a man laughs in
another man’s face we cut his
fucking tongue out

PASCALLI
Benny what the fuck
BENNY
Vlad it’s a fucking comic book

man
The Russian lets Freddy up

FREDDY
Oh fuck he broke my nose

Freddy gets up and walks away

BENNY

me

BENNY

of young punks trying to make a

out of Kadakian

BENNY

EXT AUTO SHOP-— CONTINUOUS

THE RUSSIAN
We’re really going to do this

INT PUSSYCAT FACTORY- THAT AFTERNOON

A dark strip club where KATYA early 20s Ukrainian
beautiful stands in front of a greasy overweight PATRON
beginning her lap dance

Benny holding a plate and some toothpicks from the buffet
sits down next to the Patron

KATYA
What do you want Benny

BENNY
The same thing as this guy

Katya shoots Benny a look

BENNY (CONTD)
But that’s not why I’m here

KATYA
Why are you here

Benny takes a bite of food off his plate and chews

BENNY
Well it’s not the buffet This
stuff tastes like shit

PATRON
(To Benny)
Look asshole-

The Russian appears on the other side of Katya and the
Patron

PATRON (CONTD)
(Changing his tone)
Excuse me but Katya and me-

BENNY
-Katya and I

PATRON
Katya and I are in the middle of a
song here

KATYA
(To Patron)
Don’t worry about them baby
(To Benny)
I’m working Benny go home

Katya straddles the Patron’s and runs her fingers through his
hair She finally removes her bra

BENNY
It’s about money Katya And I’m
not talking about Tuesday day-
shift strip club money I’m
talking about real money

Katya shoves the Patron’s face in her breasts forcing him to
motorboat her

KATYA
Keep talking

BENNY
Five thousand dollars

KATYA
Who do I have to fuck

BENNY
Nobody It’s a diversion job
Five Ten minutes tops

PATRON

after my song

KATYA
Shut up

Katya grabs the Patron by the tie and pulls his face into her
ass

KATYA (CONTD)
(To Benny)
When

BENNY
Tonight

The song changes and Katya suddenly stops dancing

KATYA
Song is over

THE RUSSIAN
(To the Patron)
Tip her

Not happy about it The Patron gives Katya more money and
walks away Katya sits down across from Benny and The
Russian and lights up a cigarette

KATYA
Is it going to get messy

BENNY
Oh it’s gonna get real messy

KATYA
I want ten thousand

BENNY
Ten thousand You’re not even
doing anything
KATYA
Do it without me then Ten or I’m
out
Benny looks to The Russian

THE RUSSIAN

Katya takes another drag off her cigarette
KATYA
Agreed But I don’t want to be
there when you start killing
everybody
BENNY
Agreed
INT BENNY’S CAR- THAT NIGHT

Benny and Katya sit outside of a house in Brooklyn

KATYA
So I’m just going to appear on the
doorstep like some badly written
porno

BENNY
When you got a shitload of blow
what is the one thing you want to
do

KATYA
I want to fuck

From inside the car we see two FILIPINO HOOKERS walk up to
the house and get stopped by The Russian

BENNY
Exactly

Benny looks out the window of the car

FILIPINO HOOKER 1
(To The Russian)
What do you mean the party’s
cancelled

The Russian hands each of the hookers a stack of bills The
hookers turn around and walk in the other direction

INT BROOKLYN HOUSE- CONTINUOUS

The four Gunmen from the first scene sit around the living
room Lines of coke all over the table guns scattered
throughout the room

GUNMAN 2
I don’t want to do it I’ve done it
three times already

GUNMAN 4
Just do it

GUNMAN 2
Okay
(Getting into character)
You stupid cowboys Do you know
who this belongs to Do you know
who the fuck I am

Gunman 1 smoking a cigarette ala Clint Eastwood picks up a
nerf gun

GUNMAN 1
Some dead guy

Gunman 1 fires the nerf gun at Gunman 2 “killing” him in
this overacted reenactment of the first scene The other two
gunmen laugh hysterically while giving a standing ovation

The doorbell rings

GUNMAN 2
Fuck They’re here Put the guns
away And clean up some of that
coke

GUNMAN 1
Dude it’s hookers They’ve seen
coke before

GUNMAN 2
Look at the coffee table It looks
like a Motley Crue concert in here

The Gunmen hide the guns under the couch Gunman 3 tries to
clean up the coke but doesn’t do a very good job Gunman 2
opens the door to reveal Katya

GUNMAN 2 (CONTD)
Hey come on in

GUNMAN 4
Hey we ordered two girls and
they’re supposed to be Filipino

KATYA
Filipino girls couldn’t make it
Ukrainian girls can fuck like four

girls

GUNMAN 3
Damn bitch that’s all you had to
say

Katya walks up to Gunman 3 and puts her hand over his face
She moves it down so a single finger shushes his lips and
then pushes him on to a chair Katya pulls a boombox out of
her bag and turns it on

“Honey Bee” by Tom Petty plays as Katya begins to strip and
seduces each of the Gunmen She gets down to her g-string

GUNMAN 4
I love the Ukraine

GUNMAN 3
So how’re we gonna work this

GUNMAN 4
I got first

GUNMAN 1
This isn’t like shotgun rules

GUNMAN 4
Why not

The song ends and “Thug Love” by Bone Thugs and Harmony
featuring Tupac begins

GUNMAN 2
(Aside)
Tupac This is a weird choice for
a stripper song

GUNMAN 1
Because having to sit in the back
of a Hyundai Excel and going last
in a four on one are two completely
different things We rock paper
scissors that shit

On the first gunshot in the song Benny shoots down the front
door with a Pistol and hits the stereo bringing the music to
a sudden halt Gunman 4 makes a move to go out the back
door The Russian comes from the back and cocks a shotgun

BENNY
Hey guys We’re gonna need that
coke back

The Gunmen freeze and look at one another wondering what the
next move is Katya immediately starts grabbing her clothes

GUNMAN 1
(To the other Gunmen)
Don’t say nothing He’s not going
to kill us

Benny shoots Gunman 1 point blank Blood splatters all over
Katya

BENNY
Why would you even think that

GUNMAN 3
Oh shit Ricky

KATYA
Jesus Christ Benny You said you
were going to wait This top cost
300

BENNY
I’m sorry but if I don’t shoot
this guy they’re not going to take
me seriously

KATYA
You are such an asshole

Katya storms out the door

BENNY
(after her)
I told you it was going to get
messy

The Russian forces the three remaining Gunmen onto the couch
and makes them place their hands on the coffee table

BENNY (CONTD)
Where’s the coke

GUNMAN 3
Me

BENNY
Well I’m not talking to Ricky

Gunman 2 sits on the end of the couch and notices a Samurai
sword not too far from him He sneaks his hand over in an
attempt to grab it

The Russian notices and hits Gunman 2 in the face with his
shotgun Then The Russian grabs the Samurai sword and cuts
off Gunman 4s hands He screams in agony Blood spurts
everywhere

BENNY (CONT’D)
Oh gross
(To the Gunmen)
I can’t stress how important it is
to keep your hands on the table

GUNMAN 4
I did keep my hands on the table
(To The Russian)
Why did you cut my hands off

THE RUSSIAN

Shut up

BENNY
Yeah why did you cut HIS hands
off

THE RUSSIAN
What the fuck do you care

BENNY
I don’t care it’s justweird
(Pause then to Gunman 3)
You Sideburns please just tell us
where the coke is

SIDEBURNS
If I tell you You’re just gonna
kill me

BENNY
Come on Sideburns Cocaine
Where

SIDEBURNS
It’s not here We can take you to
it

Benny shoots Sideburns in the head killing him

GUNMAN 2
Why’d you kill him

BENNY

One I don’t believe him And two
if the coke is somewhere else I
don’t need three of you to take me
there I just need one

(To Gunman 4)
And I just had my car
reupholstered so that leaves you
shit out of luck

GUNMAN 4
My hands man my fucking hands

BENNY
(To Gunmen 2)
Look I approach everything very
logically
(MORE )

BENNY (CONTD)
However you Head Wound and
especially you Stumpy know first
hand that The Russian is a bit of a
wild card

STUMPY
(To The Russian)
My hands man why’d you cut off my
fucking hands

THE RUSSIAN
I’ve had enough of this asshole

The Russian raises the Samurai sword to Stumpy ready to
strike

STUMPY
Freezer Freezer It’s in the
freezer

The Russian stops mid-strike goes to the freezer and opens
it
THE RUSSIAN
It’s here

BENNY
Thank you Stumpy

Benny shoots Stumpy in the head and turns the gun to head
wound

GUNMAN 2
Ralph wasn’t my idea I just went
along

BENNY

I don’t care

Gunman 2s head explodes and blood goes everywhere Benny
is covered in blood He looks at The Russian who lowers his
weapon

BENNY (CONTD)
I thought we weren’t going to use
the shotgun

THE RUSSIAN
I forgot

BENNY
You forgot I look like a fucking
Tarantino film over here

THE RUSSIAN
I’m sorry

BENNY
How am I gonna walk out like this

Benny goes to the mirror and wipes off his face He goes to
the closet and grabs one of the gunmen’s jackets and puts it

on over his jacket

BENNY (CONTD)
We have a plan for a reason

THE RUSSIAN
I said I was sorry what do you
want me to do Suck your dick

BENNY
You need to work on your apologies

They exit the house

INT KADAKIAN’S OFFICE- THE NEXT MORNING
Benny and The Russian sit across from Kadakian

KADAKTIAN
How did it go

Benny pulls out the coke There is blood on the bag

BENNY
It was messy

KADAKIAN

Kadakian takes out a thick envelope The Russian takes it as
the two get up to leave

BENNY
It was a pleasure working with you

KADAKTAN
The pleasure was all mine

BENNY
Well we have to give Katya her
money anyway

INT PUSSYCAT FACTORY- LATER
MONTAGE

Benny and The Russian take a shot The Russian takes it with
ease and Benny struggles The Russian laughs at Benny and
Benny hits The Russian on the shoulder The Russian takes
the rest of Benny’s shot

Benny and The Russian hand Katya an envelope She half-
smiles and then Benny takes out a few extra hundreds and
hands them to her Katya kisses Benny on the mouth Benny
is taken happily off-guard but then points to The Russian
and Katya kisses The Russian on the cheek

Benny and The Russian drink cocktails in front of the stage
and tip the DANCERS An extremely beautiful STRIPPER
saunters over to Benny and grabs him by the hand Smiling he
follows her

Back in the VIP room the Stripper gives Benny a lap dance
He shows off a twenty dollar bill and then shoves it down his
pants The Stripper shakes her head Benny then pulls out a
fifty dollar bill and shoves it down his pants The Stripper
goes after the fifty

END MONTAGE

INT PUSSYCAT FACTORY BATHROOM-— CONTINUOUS

Benny walks in to the bathroom and passes a LARGE BLACK MAN
standing at the sink Benny goes into a stall and does his
business When he comes out the man is still at the sink

As Benny washes his hands the black man catches Benny’s eye
in the mirror

BENNY
Yo Lawrence Taylor what the fuck
are you looking at

Lawrence Taylor continues to stare at him in the reflection
Benny shakes his hands dry and walks out of the bathroom

INT PUSSYCAT FACTORY- CONTINUOUS

We follow Benny back to the bar where The Russian waits with
a couple of dancers

BENNY
So where’s that shot

The Russian pours two more for the dancers The four clink
glasses and down the shots

ALL
Woohoo

BENNY
I’m the baddest mother-fucker in
the world

A little time cut to

Our guys have been here awhile Benny is completely
exhausted The Stripper sits next to Benny resting her head
on his shoulder The Russian zoned out drinks Vodka
straight from the bottle The MANAGER walks up

MANAGER
I love you guys but you’ve been
here for fourteen hours Please
please get the fuck outta here

EXT PUSSYCAT FACTORY- DAWN

Benny and The Russian walk out of the club As the door
closes they start to head toward the car

BENNY
You in the mood for waffles I
could really go for some waffles

Suddenly The Russian is SHOT IN THE NECK Grasping his neck
with one hand The Russian grabs the door Bullets fly and
The Russian is unable to get back inside the club He can
only use the door for cover Benny dives behind the door to
shield himself from getting shot as well

Benny with his back against the wall grabs his gun

BENNY (CONTD)
Did he get youoh he got you
Who the fuck was that

EXT NEARBY ROOFTOP- SAME TIME

The same large black man from the bathroom (who we now
realize is THE BLACK PHANTOM) shoots at the open door with a
scope rifle The bullets do not penetrate the door The man
drops the rifle and picks up a higher caliber machine gun

EXT PUSSYCAT FACTORY- SAME TIME
Back to Benny and The Russian behind the door

THE RUSSIAN
Is it bad

BENNY
It’s not good

(Thinking for a second)
Quick Give me the money I’m
going to take off that way
Whatever you do don’t let go of
that door

THE RUSSIAN
What about me

BENNY
No offense dude but you’re shot in
the fucking neck Youre clearly
dead Come on give me the money

The Russian takes his hand off of his neck wound and grabs
his gun Blood spurts out

THE RUSSIAN
If you take the money I’1l shoot
you in your fucking neck

BENNY
Would you listen to yourself You
are being so selfish right now

The machine guns rip through the door killing The Russian
Benny reaches in The Russian’s jacket to get the money and
another hail of gunfire flies through the door Bullets whiz
by him Benny ducks against the wall again

BENNY (CONTD)
Shit shit shit

Benny can see the envelope of money in The Russian’s jacket
Benny again moves toward The Russian’s body to go for the
money but another blast of machine gun bullets sprays
through the door and Benny goes for cover again

BENNY (CONTD)
God damnit

Benny takes off running along the building The Russian’s
limp body loses it’s grip on the door

EXT NEARBY ROOFTOP- SAME TIME

We see the door close through the scope on The Black
Phantom’s gun There is only one body lying dead outside the
club Running for his life Benny slips around the corner
and into the alley

The Black Phantom takes out a handgun cocks it and runs
down the fire escape and after Benny

EXT STREET- CONTINUOUS

Benny runs frantically Looking behind him sees The Black

Phantom running after him Buildings line the street To
his left Benny sees a small alley and runs down it

At the end of the alley is a railing overlooking the train
tracks A bullet hits the railing inches from Benny He
looks back to see The Black Phantom more than a hundred yards
away running toward him gun pointed

Benny climbs onto the other side of the railing and tries to
make his way to a fire escape on one of the nearby buildings
Another bullet hits the railing startling Benny He falls
and lands on a moving train as it emerges out of the tunnel
underneath the street Realizing he’s not dead Benny begins
to laugh

The Black Phantom comes to the edge of the railing As the
train moves Benny’s gets smaller

BENNY
Fuck you Phantom

Benny flips The Phantom off knowing he’s safe Suddenly
his middle finger is shot off That must have been 200
yards Benny grasps his hand in pain and the train speeds
forward and The Black Phantom is no longer in sight
BENNY (CONTD)
Oh God My fucking finger
INT BATHROOM- LATER
Benny hand in pocket stumbles into a dirty bathroom
BENNY
It’s not that bad it’s not that
bad it’s not that-—

Benny takes his hand out of his pocket to see that his middle
finger is completely severed at the knuckle

BENNY (CONTD)
-Oh fuck

Writhing in agony he grabs paper towels and begins to
bandage what’s left of his finger
INT KADAKIAN’S OFFICE- LATER

Kadakian works behind his desk Voices can be heard outside
the door

ZAKAR (0S)
You can’t go in there

BENNY (0S)
Fuck you

Benny storms into Kadakian’s office followed by Zakar

ZAKAR
Give me your weapon

BENNY
My weapon stays right here
(To Kadakian)
You hear me you slippery Armenian
fuck

Zakar looks to Kadakian who shakes his head JZacar punches
Benny in the face and grabs his gun

KADAKIAN
Leave us

Zacar exits

KADAKIAN (CONTD)
Have a seat

Benny stands

BENNY
What the hell happened

KADAKTIAN
Pascalli found out you did the job

BENNY
What How

KADAKIAN
I told him

BENNY
Why the fuck did you do that

KADAKTIAN
I needed my drugs and I needed
Pascalli’s two best hitmen dead
So why not kill two birds with one
stone

BENNY
We’re independent contractors
KADAKIAN
Tell that to Pascalli

BENNY
How did you know he was going to
kill us over moonlighting It’s
fucked up but it’s not necessarily
a murdering offense Why is he so
pissed that he sent The Black-
fucking-Phantom after us

FREDDY
Pascalli doesn’t even know his

Phantom

BENNY
That’s a good question Why would
you protect him See now I think

track

FREDDY
Can I have a cigarette Benny

Benny pulls out a pack of cigarettes puts one in Freddy’s
mouth and lights it for him Benny takes the cigarette from
Freddy’s mouth so he can exhale and then puts it back in

BENNY
All right Just tell me everything
you do know about him Now think
real hard because if you say “I
don’t know anything” that makes me
want to pick up the hammer again

FREDDY
Okay He’s a black guy Wears a
lot of dark colors Not much of a
talker

Again Benny takes the cigarette from Freddy’s mouth and then
puts it back in after Freddy inhales

you with the sledgehammer because

INT BLACK PHANTOM’S HOUSE- ABOUT MIDNIGHT

The Black Phantom enters the kitchen wearing a wife beater
and some pajama bottoms For a guy in his late thirties
he’s incredibly ripped

He opens the refrigerator drinks some orange juice right
from the carton and then puts it back in the refrigerator
We hear a gun cock from the living room The Black Phantom
freezes and turns to see Benny sitting on the couch in the
living room in the dark

BENNY
Hey man why don’t you have a seat
and stay awhile

Benny motions to the recliner across from him The Black
Phantom hands up looks to the breadbox in the kitchen

BENNY (CONT’D)
The 38’s not in the breadbox I
also got the Tech9 in the hatbox
and the Desert Eagle taped to the
back of the television I got all
three

Benny motions once again for the Phantom to sit in the
recliner The Black Phantom moves over and takes a seat
Benny takes out a cigarette for himself and offers one to the
Phantom

BENNY (CONT’D)
(Re his finger)

Excellent shot by the way That
shot from that model gun from
that distance do you have any idea
how many people in the world could
have made that shot statistically
speaking

THE BLACK PHANTOM
I dunno a hundred

BENNY
Eleven Eleven people in the world
could have made that shot You
want a cigarette

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Id prefer it if you didn’t smoke
in here

BENNY
Yeah well I’d prefer it if I had
ten fucking fingers Take one

THE BLACK PHANTOM
My wife would kill me

BENNY
I think given the circumstances
she wouldn’t mind

THE BLACK PHANTOM
You don’t have to live with her

Benny laughs
BENNY

You know for a mass murderer
youre pretty witty
THE BLACK PHANTOM
Let’s cut the shit I know you
didn’t come here to compliment me
Are you going to kill me or not

Benny lights up his cigarette and starts smoking

BENNY
Since I’m the one with the gun how
‘bout I ask the questions
(Pause)
I hacked into your military service
record Are you as good as they
Say you are

THE BLACK PHANTOM
No I’m much much better

BENNY
Good Pascalli wants me dead I
had one way out and you killed
him

THE BLACK PHANTOM
So you want the money I got for The
Russian’s contract

BENNY
No That was a clean contract
You earned that money fair and
square That’s your money You
and me-

THE BLACK PHANTOM
-you and I-

Benny smiles

BENNY
You and I are going to take down
the Pascalli family

THE BLACK PHANTOM

Oh So the two of us are going to
take down the entire Italian mafia

BENNY (CONTD)
The Lucky Luciano Carlo Gambino
John Gotti days are over man

best

Benny looks around for something to ash into There are no
ashtrays or dishes around The house is immaculate He
grabs a framed picture of the family smiling and knocks it
down to use as an ashtray The Phantom stares at the
picture

BENNY (CONTD)
What do you think

THE BLACK PHANTOM
I think I’1l have one of those
cigarettes now

Benny lights another cigarette in his mouth and gives it to
the Phantom The Phantom inhales deeply

THE BLACK PHANTOM (CONT’D)
What do you get out of it

BENNY
My safety

THE BLACK PHANTOM
And

BENNY
And I get two hundred thousand from
Kadakian when the job’s over

THE BLACK PHANTOM
And I assume we’re not sharing
that

BENNY
Nope So what do you think

THE BLACK PHANTOM
I think you’re a really smart guy
and if you’re gonna use me to take
down Pascalli you’re going to have
to put a gun in my hand And if I
have a gun what is going to stop
me from turning that gun on you and
eradicating myself from this
situation

BENNY
Well this is the part of the plan
that you’re really really not
gonna like

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Continue

BENNY
Youre going to have to use your
family as collateral

The Phantom is taken aback by the audacity of this statement

THE BLACK PHANTOM
No deal

BENNY
You don’t have another option

THE BLACK PHANTOM
There is one

The Phantom reaches for the picture frame to ash out his
cigarette

BENNY
What’s that

The Phantom picks up the picture frame and throws it like a
ninja star right into Benny’s hand knocking the gun halfway
across the room Benny jumps up and chases after the gun

The Phantom reclines the LazyBoy and reaches underneath the
chair

Benny fumbles for the gun and we hear the hammer of the
revolver cock back

Reveal the Phantom holding a 44 Magnum revolver pointed
directly at Benny

THE BLACK PHANTOM
We’re going with Plan B bitch

Benny looks at him with terror in his eyes and raises his
hands

BENNY
Don’t shoot don’t shoot

The Phantom pulls the trigger Click Nothing He pulls
the trigger back again Click Nothing Benny smiles

BENNY (CONTD)
Did I say I got all three I meant
four

Benny flicks his wrist to reveal another handgun hidden in
his sleeve

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Mother fucker

BENNY

Oh my God you should have seen the
look on your face

(Imitating The Phantom)
“Were going with Plan B bitch”

(Laughing)
That was priceless Sorry Sorry
One thing you gotta know about me
I have a pretty dark sense of
humor You just tried to kill me
and I don’t even care But it does
illustrates my point that I’m
definitely going to need
collateral

Just then we hear a door open and footsteps coming down the
hallway Alicia walks sleepy-eyed in to the living room

ALICIA
What the hell’s going on in here
Are you smoking

BENNY
Please tell me she knows what you
do or else this is going to be a
whole thing

THE BLACK PHANTOM
She knows

BENNY
Thank God Alright you two sit
on the couch

The Phantom and Alicia move to the couch and Benny takes a
seat in the recliner Benny picks up his other gun and puts
it in his side
ALICIA
Honey why is there a gun pointed
at me in my living room

THE BLACK PHANTOM
I’m going to give you the short
short version

BENNY
Spaceballs Nice

THE BLACK PHANTOM
I took a contract on him he got
away-

ALICIA
Why did he get away

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Baby I love you But not now As
I was saying he got away and if I
don’t do this job for him he’s
going to kill me

ALICIA
Just do the job

THE BLACK PHANTOM
If youll let me finish he’s going
to need you and Garrett as
collateral

ALICIA
What do you mean as collateral

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Answer the woman Benny

BENNY
I got this chamber It’s really a
safe but I call it a chamber so it
doesn’t sound as awful I use it
for kidnappings ransoms etc It
pumps out oxygen for up to thirty-
six hours which will give us plenty
of time to get killed But if we
don’t we kill Pascalli get my
money and open in the safe In
that order

THE BLACK PHANTOM
No way Just kill me and get the
fuck out of my house

Alicia shoots him a look

THE BLACK PHANTOM (CONT’D)
There’s no other way We do like
this then you and Garrett are
safe

Benny raises his hand his look showing he’s going to give
some really bad news

BENNY
She’s seen my face She shows up
at my hearing with that cute kid
there goes my shot at parole right
there Good news is as long as
the kid doesn’t wake up he’s cool
So you might want to hurry up and
make a decision

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Can you give us a minute

BENNY
As long as I can still see you

The Phantom and Alicia go over to the corner and begin to
whisper

ALICIA
Before you answer me I don’t want
to hear any of your narcissistic
macho tough-guy bullshit because
this is about our son Can you do
that for me

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Yeah

ALICIA

Here I packed a bag for you Go
wait in the living room I need to
talk to your mom

Garrett grabs his bag and walks out of his bedroom passing
his mother who walks in and hugs the Phantom

THE BLACK PHANTOM (CONT’D)
God that was hard I’m so sorry

ALICIA
Don’t do that I knew what I was
getting into

THE BLACK PHANTOM

ALICIA

BENNY

Benny shoots the Phantom in the neck with a taser

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Damnit

BENNY

The Phantom falls to the ground paralyzed

BENNY (CONTD)

(to Alicia)

THE BLACK PHANTOM

EXT BLACK PHANTOM’S HOUSE- DAYLIGHT

Benny pulls up and the Phantom comes out of the house Benny
gets out of the car

BENNY
We’re taking your car

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Why are we taking my car

BENNY
Because I’m dead Why the fuck
would we take my car
INT PHANTOM’S ESCALADE- CONTINUOUS

The Phantom drives Both he and Benny are silent It’s
awkward

BENNY
Whatcha thinkin’

THE BLACK PHANTOM
I’m thinking the same thing I’ve
been thinking since you showed up
in my living room Why did I shoot
The Russian first

BENNY
Why did you shoot The Russian
first

THE BLACK PHANTOM
The Russian was worth forty You
were worth ten

BENNY
Un-fucking-believable Ten
thousand This is the problem with
organized crime Everyone
overestimates the brawn and
underestimates the brains

THE BLACK PHANTOM
If you’re the brains why’d you
take the Kadakian suicide job

BENNY
‘Cause when I didn’t want to do it
The Russian called me a faggot

THE BLACK PHANTOM
What are you Marty McFly

BENNY
From Back to the Future As in
(As Biff)
“What are you chicken”
(Back to himself)
You like that movie

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Of course I love that movie
BENNY
Me too You’re a pretty smart guy
You were as hard as shit to find
It took me five days just to get
your name Oh but when I got it-

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Shut up

BENNY
Oh come on

THE BLACK PHANTOM
I’m serious Don’t say it

BENNY
Michael Richards

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Damn it

BENNY
Now how does a black militant like
yourself wind up with the name
Michael Richards

THE BLACK PHANTOM
It’s a very common name And the
sad thing is I loved that damn
show

BENNY
So what do you want me to call you
I feel kind of weird calling you
“The Black Phantom” the whole time

THE BLACK PHANTOM
It’s not “The Black Phantom” It’s
“The Phantom” I was “The Phantom”
for four years working down south
and then as soon as I came up North
and started working for white
people everything that’s black
you have to label as black

BENNY
Oh don’t give me that “white
people” shit You people do it
too

THE BLACK PHANTOM
“You people”

BENNY
“You people who happen to be
black” Is that less offensive

THE BLACK PHANTOM
No we don’t

BENNY
Youre telling me that a black
girl loses her black boyfriend to a
white girl she’s gonna leave race
out of the story Like she and her
girlfriend would be out and see
her man’s new girl and the friend
would be “Oh she’s white You
never mentioned that” “I didn’t
think it was important” Bullshit

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Mike man Just call me Mike

BENNY
Can I call you Kramer

THE BLACK PHANTOM
No Call me Mike

BENNY
Well Mike Once I got your name
I hacked into the military
intelligence database

THE BLACK PHANTOM
How’d you do that

BENNY
Oh the shit I know how to do
Mike will blow your fucking mind
Looking at your file I mean wow
That blew my fucking mind

THE BLACK PHANTOM
I don’t wanna talk about that

BENNY
Just trying to make conversation
I’m boredWhy’d you join
THE BLACK PHANTOM
Well when I got out of Grambling
and I didn’t get drafted like I
thought I would I didn’t have a
whole lot going on

BENNY
You thought you were gonna get
drafted You were 1AA

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Walter Payton Steve McNair Jerry
Rice all 1AA

BENNY
Doug Williams He went to
Grambling why didn’t you mention
him

THE BLACK PHANTOM
I’m not a big Doug Williams fan

BENNY
What Washington Redskins
Superbowl XXII MVP First black
quarterback to win the Superbowl
How can you not like Doug Williams
Youre black Isn’t that in the
rules somewhere

THE BLACK PHANTOM
No Liking Doug Williams is not in
the Black Rulebook I’m a Cowboys
fan

BENNY
Cowboys You gotta be shittin’ me
I bleed burgundy and gold baby

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Anyway I wasn’t doing shit And
then September 11th happened and I
figured somebody has got to save
the world why not me

BENNY
So how do you go from a highly
decorated captain to a gun for
hire

Silence

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Because they lied to me I joined
because if we didn’t get Sadaam he
was gonna take over the entire
world I drank their Kool-Aid and
ate their Freedom Fries But there
were no weapons of mass destruction
and we didn’t take down the bad
guys We went after the guys who
had the oil and wouldn’t sell it to
us So when I got out the army
had made me this finely-tuned
killing machine and I didn’t want
to waste it I just wanted to
decide who the bad guys were

BENNY
Sadaam Hussein was a mass-murderer
He killed thousands of his own
people

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Nobody even talked about Sadaam
until after they couldn’t find the
WMDs they changed their stance to
“Well he’s a dick anyway” A dick
who happens to have a shitload of
oil

BENNY
The thing about oil is we fucking
need it This Escalade that you’re
driving doesn’t run on world peace
You’re no better than those fucking
liberals You wanna eat the
hamburger but god forbid we kill
any of the cows

THE BLACK PHANTOM
I killed a shitload of cows I
can’t believe it I’m in the car
with a damn Republican

BENNY
(To the tune of Deep Blue
Something’s “Breakfast at
Tiffanys”)
You say that weve got nothing in
common No common ground to start
from And were falling apart
(MORE )

BENNY (CONTD)

Youll say the world has come
between us Our lives have come
between us But I know you just
dont care

(Pause for effect)
And I said what about Back to the
Future” He said I think I
remember the film and as I recall
I think we both kinda liked it
And I said Well thats the one
thing weve got

INT PASCALLI’S BAR- LATER THAT MORNING
Pascalli sits in his usual booth with Nicky Gino Billy
The same four bodyguards protecting him Apparently this is
what they do everyday
The Black Phantom walks into the room carrying a body bag
over his shoulder He makes his way back to Pascalli’s booth
and roughly drops the bag down on the ground
Billy comes up to frisk the Phantom per procedure
BILLY
Hey Black Phantom hope you don’t
mind Just a little a formality

Billy starts to pat down the Phantom The Phantom glares at
him and Billy stops

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Take your hands off me

Billy takes his hands off Pascalli nods

GINO
Let’s see that little Dutch faggot

The Phantom upzips the body bag revealing Benny’s face

BILLY

The Phantom zips it up fast

THE BLACK PHANTOM

THE BLACK PHANTOM
(To Billy)

THE BLACK PHANTOM

Billy goes over to the bar and begins to page through the
bartending encyclopedia

PASCALLI
How’d ya do it What’s the story
behind this hit

THE BLACK PHANTOM
He missed I didn’t

PASCALLI
Good storyBenny never was a good
shot anyway

Pascalli laughs Gino gets up from the booth

GINO
I gotta take a piss
(to Billy)
Hey make me one of those
Ballantyne Sonatas too

Gino heads the bathroom
GINO (CONTD)
I don’t usually drink that ghetto

shit But when in Rome

Gino closes the door behind him The Phantom stands up and
walks toward the bathroom

BILLY (0S)
It’s not in here

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Then I’1ll just have a-

The Phantom picks up a chair and wedges it under the doorknob
of the bathroom

THE BLACK PHANTOM (CONT’D)
-McFly

At the word “McFly” the body bag rips open and Benny springs
up pointing a gun at Pascalli

The Black Phantom jumps into action pulls out his gun and
shoots one of the bodyguards in the forehead

Benny frantically shoots at Pascalli Bullets go everywhere
except into Pascalli

Billy drops behind the bar and hides

BILLY
Holy shit God damnit

The Black Phantom takes out another bodyguard with a shot to
the chest followed by a shot to the head

Gino bangs on the bathroom door trying to get out He begins
shooting at the door bullets barely miss the Phantom The
Phantom fires at the bathroom door but bullets continue to
come out

The Phantom continues to shoot at the bathroom door

Nicky points his gun at Benny and The Phantom shoots Nicky in
the arm The gun falls out of Nicky’s hand

NICKY
Fuck this

Nicky runs into the back room

The Phantom alternates between shooting at the door and
shooting at the other two bodyguards

Benny continues to fire at Pascalli until he runs out of
bullets He still hasn’t hit Pascalli Pascalli pulls out a
gun and points it at Benny

PASCALLI
Die you Dutch faggot

BENNY
Mike

The Phantom takes out a new clip to try to hit Pascalli and
realizes there is no time to reload The Phantom throws the
gun at Pascalli hitting him in the nose Pascalli falls back
and drops his gun

The Phantom pulls out his backup pistol and shoots the third
bodyguard in the head killing him

Nicky comes out of the back room with a Tommy gun

NICKY
Goodbye assholes

The Phantom realizes Benny’s in trouble He rushes over to
Benny and tackles him to the ground to protect him as Nicky
starts laying down gunfire

The Phantom points his gun at Nicky when he realizes he and
Benny are in the direct line of fire from Pascalli who has
gotten his gun back He pushes Benny’s head down and bullets
narrowly miss Benny

With gunfire coming from Pascalli the remaining bodyguard
and Nicky’s Tommy gun the Phantom decides to call it a day

The Phantom pulls Benny out the front door of the bar in the
midst of heavy gunfire

EXT PASCALLI’S BAR- CONTINUOUS

Benny and The Phantom run out of the bar toward the Escalade
The Phantom pushes the keyless entry on the car unlocking it
and starting the engine

Nicky runs out of the bar still shooting with the Tommy gun

Benny and The Phantom jump in the car and drive away

INT PHANTOM’S ESCALADE- CONTINUOUS
Silence
Silence
Silence

THE BLACK PHANTOM
What the fuck was that back there
Are you kidding me How did you
miss him

BENNY
You said you were going to put him
right in front of me The plan was
to put him right in front of me I
WAS LIKE 30 FEET AWAY

THE BLACK PHANTOM
You were 15 feet You were 15 feet
away God You are a horrible
shot

BENNY
Well I was a much better shot
before someone blew one of my
fucking fingers off

THE BLACK PHANTOM
And if you know you’re such a
horrible shot what the fuck are
you doing using a god damn six-
shooter

BENNY
It was a 357 stainless steel
Magnum revolver It was a gift
from Pascalli

(MORE )
BENNY (CONTD)
This ain’t no “Cowboys and Indians
six-shooter” it’s a God damn hand
cannon You hit someone one time
and he ain’t coming back

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Oh yeah Well what happens if you
hit him none times What happens
then I should have taken my
chances back in my living room
You probably would have missed

BENNY
Look maybe you should just watch
your tone

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Watch my tone

BENNY
Don’t forget I’m the one who’s
got your wife and kid in a safe

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Oh You do have my family ina
safe I totally forgot I thought
I was doing this job for you
because of your warm personality
and marksmanship

BENNY
Alright look I fucked up I’m
sorry Let’s get past this and
focus on the task at hand I mean
if anything this brought us
closer

THE BLACK PHANTOM
How so

BENNY
Because now Pascalli wants us both
dead and it’s a good thing we have
your people in that safe

THE BLACK PHANTOM
And why is that

BENNY
Because if I can get to your
family you better believe Pascalli
can too

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Fantastic

Benny takes out his phone and dials The phone rings as

Benny and The Phantom continue their conversation

BENNY
I’m calling Ricardo

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Who the fuck is Ricardo

BENNY

He’s my one friend you didn’t kill

(into the phone)
Ricardo it’s Benny I’mina
major fucking spot right here and I
need a favor You get a beat on
Pascalli or any of his guys hit me

Benny hangs up the phone

THE BLACK PHANTOM
So what now

BENNY
We wait We gotta kill some time
and I fucked up so whatever you
want to do we’ll do

INT BOWLING ALLEY- THAT AFTERNOON

We open on Benny trying to get his fingers in the bowling

ball It’s not easy to hold with one finger missing

BENNY
(Re bowling)
Really

THE BLACK PHANTOM
You said anything

BENNY
Of all the motels in all the world
I gotta pick the one across the
street from a bowling alley

Benny finally gets a handle on the ball and throws it down

the lane Gutter
BENNY (CONT’D)
Damnit Okay now that we’re calm
let’s talk about the job How many
did you hit at Pascalli’s

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Three definite Maybe four

BENNY
Whod you get

THE BLACK PHANTOM
I don’t know their names
Obviously not Pascalli Obviously
not the dude who came out with the
Tommy gun-—

BENNY
-That was Nicky Pascalli His son
And where the fuck did he get a
Tommy gun The Smithsonian

THE BLACK PHANTOM
I got the really tall stocky dude
with no neck

BENNY
Marco

THE BLACK PHANTOM
I got the one with the eightball on
his forearm

BENNY
Eight ball

THE BLACK PHANTOM
And the dude with the Paulie
Wallnuts haircut

BENNY
Lucky

THE BLACK PHANTOM
And I might have gotten the one in
the bathroom That first dude that
called you a Dutch faggot

BENNY
That would be Gino So that leaves
Pascalli Nicky Billy and maybe
Gino Four Oh and Frankie
(MORE)

BENNY (CONTD)
That’s five Okay that’s not
terrible Three down five to go
That’s not bad for a first strike

The Phantom throws his bowling ball down the lane and gets a
strike

THE BLACK PHANTOM
There was only supposed to be one
strike

A WAITRESS comes by and drops some food off

Benny tips the waitress sits down and takes a huge bite of
his burger He looks over at The Phantom who is praying
before he eats Benny stares The Phantom raises his head

BENNY
You’ve got to be shittin’ me

THE BLACK PHANTOM
You don’t believe in God

BENNY
I don’t believe in the Bible

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Why not

BENNY
Why don’t I believe that we all
came from two people That two of
every species of animal got on a
boat for forty days and nights
Why don’t I believe a guy lived in
the belly of a fish for three days
with no oxygen I dunno I guess
I’m just naive Isn’t there
something about “Thou Shalt Not
Kill” in there

THE BLACK PHANTOM
“Judge not lest ye be judged”
Besides I’m just casting out the
wicked

BENNY
Whatever helps you sleep at night

THE BLACK PHANTOM
So what do you think life comes
from Just one big bang
BENNY
I know I know I’m gonna say
“yeah” and then you’re gonna say
“Well where did the bang come
from”

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Then what do you believe

BENNY
You know what I believe I believe
life comes down to about seven or
eight lefts when you shoulda taken
a right

The Phantom ponders that statement

THE BLACK PHANTOM
You know what That’s probably the
first intelligent thing you’ve said
since I’ve met you
(Pause)
So what got you into the life

BENNY
Why

THE BLACK PHANTOM
I’m bored Just trying to make
conversation

BENNY
What do you already know

THE BLACK PHANTOM
I just know that you’re an egghead
that went to some Ivy League
school Cornell or some shit

BENNY
Cornell Fuck you I went to
Dartmouth I was a white kid ina
little wannabee gang with my older
brother in the DC suburbs just
doing dumb kid shit Slinging a
little stealing a little But all
good things must come to an end
Some shit went down people got
killed and that was enough for me
I hit the books again and got my
grades back up to a 40 and wrote
an essay on my life experiences

(MORE )

BENNY (CONTD)
Essay gets published full-ride to
Dartmouth

THE BLACK PHANTOM
I figured you for one of those rich
white kids that got your education
handed to you

BENNY
Fuck no I didn’t join a gang
because I thought it was cool I
joined because our lights got cut
off So I get to Dartmouth and I’m
surrounded by all those white kids
that you were just talking about
And the haves and have-nots don’t
mix so well I guess old habits
die hard So I started robbing
them and I would get really good
at getting the drop on their
property BandE was like an art form
to me I robbed the whole floor
and my cousin hooked me up with a
fence in New York

THE BLACK PHANTOM
How come they never figured out it
was you if you were the only one
that didn’t get robbed

BENNY
Oh I robbed myself Put on a real
big tear-fest in front of everyone
I’d lay it on real thick too I
was like Phillip Seymour Hoffman or
some shit

THE BLACK PHANTOM
You never felt bad about that
Robbing from your friends

BENNY
No They had everything I didn’t
feel bad for them Wait no
that’s not true I did feel bad
one time It was the third time I
had robbed myself I had this
little thirteen inch television and
I really played it up about how I
didn’t have my TV and who would do
this and I really outdid myself I
could have gotten an Oscar for that
one

(MORE)

BENNY (CONTD)
All the kids felt so bad they got
their parents to chip in and buy me
a 60” Sony with surround sound I
felt real bad about that shit

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Amazing How’d you go from BandE to
contract killer

BENNY
So senior year one of my
professors was a degenerate
gambler And somehow he found out
I was the one that was jacking
everybody I had to give him a cut
or else he would get me kicked out
of school So he starts taxing me
Ive got one semester left and he’s
trying to juice me for everything
before I get that diploma At the
same time he’s raking up this huge
debt with my roommate who was his
bookie But my roommate doesn’t
have any muscle My fence was tied
in with this loan shark so I
bought the professor’s debt from my
roommate and I sold it to that
motherfucker And this dude is
charging something crazy like 35
points Naturally the professor
starts falling behind He starts
showing up to class with black
eyes broken legs So he starts
taxing me more But even with the
increase he can’t keep up So
then I go to the loan shark who’s
crazy He’s more concerned about
the principle of getting stiffed
than he is about actually getting
the money So when he took the
contract out on my professor I
thought “Why should someone else
profit from this perfect plan I put
together” So I took it I liked
that shit it was exciting And
after you do something like that
after you murder your Ethics
professor for five grand there’s
no way you can ever sit ina
cubicle

THE BLACK PHANTOM
I think that story makes a pretty
good case on why schools shouldn’t
offer scholarships anymore

Benny laughs Benny’s cell phone rings

BENNY
Oh shit it’s Ricardo

Benny picks up the phone
BENNY (CONT’D)
Jesus Christ Ricardo what took
you so long I’m literally dying
over here You got anything for
me

INT RANDOM APARTMENT- SAME TIME

Ricardo stands in the middle of the apartment Ricardo paces
around the apartment with a bloody knife in his hand

RICARDO
So I’m in Chelsea-

INTERCUT BETWEEN BENNY AND RICARDO

BENNY
What the fuck are you doing in
Chelsea

RICARDO
I know right I’m whacking out
this poof-

BENNY

I believe the politically correct
term is puff

RICARDO
Whatever But it’s not a regular
whack job It’s an information job
too And this dude is just not
giving it up man And I’m trying
everything

Ricardo walks past the bed where we see a decapitated man in
the background

RICARDO (CONTD)
For a pillow-biter this dude was
no joke So I’m going through his
phone and he’s got all these dirty
text messages from a Gino V

Close-up on a text message that reads “Ill be in the second
to last stall waiting for you to suck my huge cock”

BENNY
No way

RICARDO
And I’m thinking I know a Gino V
So I check that number with the
number in my phone it’s the same
fucking guy

BENNY
Gino is a poof

RICARDO
He’s supposed to meet him tonight
at The Boiler Room

Benny grabs the scorecard from the Phantom and begins to jot
down some information

BENNY
Okay okay Hey I owe you I
know I know Late

Benny hangs up the phone and walks back over to the Phantom

BENNY (CONTD)
The good news is you didn’t kill
Gino

INT HANDICAP BATHROOM STALL- THAT NIGHT

Graffiti lines the walls of this gritty stall Both Benny
and the Phantom stare at a large hole in the stall that sits
conveniently at waist level Techno music can be heard
pumping in the background

THE BLACK PHANTOM
What’s the plan

BENNY
He’s gonna stick his dick through
that hole and you’re gonna suck it
(MORE )

BENNY (CONTD)
And if he doesn’t tell us where
Pascalli is you’re gonna stop

The Phantom stares at Benny not laughing

BENNY (CONT’D)
Okay Plan B He gets into the
stall You lock the door And
then I’m gonna do what I do You
just look black and scary

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Why don’t I interrogate him and
you back me up

BENNY
Don’t take this the wrong way I
think the world of you But this
isn’t some snatch and grab shoot-
em-up and go deal We gotta get
information and we don’t have a lot
of time

THE BLACK PHANTOM
So you’re saying that you don’t
think I can do it

BENNY
In the time frame we’re working
with No

THE BLACK PHANTOM
What’s the time frame

BENNY
Two three minutes tops

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Ill bet you ten thousand dollars I
get everything we need in sixty
seconds

The door to the bathroom opens and an unseen man walks in
Silence He enters the stall next to Benny and The Phantom
Benny quickly exits his stall and locks the door to the
bathroom Benny looks at his watch and hits the timer

We hear pants unzip and see the look on The Phantom’s face as
a dick comes through the glory hole The Phantom walks over
raises the butt of his gun and comes down on the balls
squishing them completely We hear a scream out of agony

Benny kicks open the other stall

BENNY
Oh shit it’s the wrong guy

THE BLACK PHANTOM
What

BENNY
I’m kidding I’m kidding it’s the
right guy

We hear screams from Gino writhing in pain

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Stop sabotaging or the bet’s off

Gino looks up

GINO
Benny

BENNY
Whos the faggot now

THE BLACK PHANTOM
(yelling)
Fuck Benny you’re dealing with the
Black Mother-fucking Phantom
Where the fuck is Pascalli

GINO
I don’t know

THE BLACK PHANTOM
You just think I’m a stupid nigger
don’t you We all out of stupid
nigger but we got plenty of crazy
nigger

The Phantom smashes Gino’s balls with the butt of the gun
three times Gino cries out in pain

GINO
Stop Stop

The Phantom points it at Gino’s dick

THE BLACK PHANTOM
I am done fucking playing with you
I’m going to blow your fucking dick
off if you don’t tell me where
Pascalli is right now

GINO
I don’t know where he is right now

The Phantom cocks the hammer

GINO (CONTD)

He’s travelling all around You
guys scared the shit out of him
I’m meeting Billy at the gun
warehouse in the morning to re-up
and then he’s gonna take me to him
I swear to God I would never call
you a stupid nigger

THE BLACK PHANTOM

Spencer

THE BLACK PHANTOM

Benny looks at his watch

BENNY
Fifty-seven seconds

The Phantom shoots Gino in the head The Phantom puts his
gun in his pocket

THE BLACK PHANTOM
You owe me ten thousand dollars

BENNY
Yeah yeah yeah Give me a boost

The Phantom helps Benny up to climb out of the window of the
bathroom

INT MOTEL ROOM- LATER THAT NIGHT

A hotel room with two double beds Benny sits on one of the
beds while The Phantom brushes his teeth

THE BLACK PHANTOM
That gay bar must have been torture
for you

BENNY
I’m not homophobic

THE BLACK PHANTOM
What The whole reason for this
left turn is because you couldn’t
say no after someone called you a
faggot

Spit

BENNY
Yeah but not “suck a dick” faggot
but in the context of “I’m too much
of a pussy to do this job” faggot
It’s you God-freaks that have a
problem with gays

THE BLACK PHANTOM
God intended for love to be between
a man and a woman

The Phantom rinses

BENNY
Oh don’t give me that Adam and Eve
Adam and Steve bullshit Being gay
isn’t a choice It’s just like
being black

THE BLACK PHANTOM
No no I can’t choose to be black
But I can choose to not suck a
dick

Benny and The Phantom cross as Benny moves into the bathroom
to brush his teeth The Phantom sits on his bed
Spit

BENNY
Yeah but you can’t choose whether
or not really really wanna suck a
dick You think some kid living in
ass-backwards Mississippi is
thinking “Hmmmmhow can I make
everyone hate me” Bullshit
Youre either born straight or
you’re not

THE BLACK PHANTOM
It’s all about temptation You can
either overcome your worldly
desires or you can succumb to them

BENNY
Fuck that If God made you to love
dudes but sentences you to burn in
hell for acting on it then he’s a
fucking dick

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Hey man watch that shit

BENNY
I used to think gays were inferior
too

THE BLACK PHANTOM
What changed

BENNY
I’m at this club having a few
drinks and me and this big gay
dude start having words I’m not
holding my tongue because I’m used
to gays being sissy little queens
Now this dude he’s like a gay Vin
Diesel or some shit

Benny rinses

THE BLACK PHANTOM
So what happened

BENNY
He beats the shit out of me in
front of like two hundred people
Like really wailing away

(MORE)

Benny walks back and sits on his bed

bed

BENNY (CONTD)
And I’m on the ground thinking
“Maybe these faggots ain’t such
faggots They’re alright”

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Did you give the gay dude a pass

BENNY
No I waited for him in the parking
lot and shot him in the face I
thought about giving him a pass
but I said to myself “If I don’t
kill this guy I’d only be letting
him go because he’s gay and that
wouldn’t be right Because in the
end they just want to be treated
like everyone else”

THE BLACK PHANTOM
You got a really weird code
Dutchman For someone who believes
so strongly in homosexual equality
you sure say “faggot” a lot

BENNY
Yeah but I don’t mean it like
(Southern accent)
“Bll faggots will burn in hell”
(Back to normal)
More like “You have Nickelback in
your iPodFaggot” It’s just a
fun word to say Plus in my line
of work it’s a pretty effective
tool It helps with moral “Get
your faggot ass up and let’s do
this”

THE BLACK PHANTOM
You make a lot of valid points but
I still think homosexuality is a
sin

BENNY
Says the guy who had another man’s
dick in his hand today

THE BLACK PHANTOM
(Holding back a smile)
Oh shut up

The two get ready for
BENNY
You were pretty badass back there
man Shit I was scared

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Pretty good huh

BENNY
Eh you got the job done but you
really didn’t do it with much
class You torture a dude and he
gives up the information you can’t
just blast him like that

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Why not

BENNY
You gotta give him a cigarette
first

THE BLACK PHANTOM
What if he doesn’t smoke

BENNY
Doesn’t matter It’s a calming
effect ‘Cause all that shit that

you heard about cancer and
Emphysema and voice boxes isn’t
gonna matter anymore because
cigarettes are not gonna kill you
It’s a nice “fuck you” before you
go into that white light If you
take out all the side effects
smoking’s pretty fucking cool

THE BLACK PHANTOM
I caught Garrett smoking two days
before he had this big showcase
recital in DC

BENNY
What’d you do

THE BLACK PHANTOM
I cancelled the whole trip

BENNY
Harsh You’re a pretty no nonsense
father huh

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Damn right He was only ten years
old He don’t need to be smoking
cigarettes I never had that
problem again

BENNY
Where’d you come up with the name
Garrett You a big SNL fan

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Nah I named him after Garrett
Morgan the black man who-

BENNY
-invented the traffic light in
1923 How’d he take you canceling
his recital

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Not well He didn’t talk to me for
a week but later he understood
That same showcase is coming up
again in April Hopefully he’1l be
able to do that one

BENNY
Don’t do that

THE BLACK PHANTOM
What

BENNY
I know what you’re doing You slip
your kid into the conversation
make me think about him and feel
sorry about his whole plight in
this and just say “Hey maybe I’1l
let him go and you’1l help me with
my problem based on the honor
system” You didn’t have to take
the contract on me You made that
left turn

THE BLACK PHANTOM
You didn’t have to take my son

BENNY
YOU DIDNT HAVE TO KILL KATYA I
liked her man She was my friend

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Youre right I didn’t have to
kill Katya I’m sorry I won’t
bring up my son anymore Now let’s
get some sleep and tomorrow we’1l
finish this

Lights out

INT SAFE- SAME TIME
Alicia sleeps as Garrett nudges her to wake up

GARRETT
Mommy I can’t breathe

ALICIA
What about the oxygen pump

GARRETT
It turned off an hour ago

Alicia rushes over to the pump where oxygen is fed into the
tank and begins to bang on it trying desperately to get it
to work again The alarm on the tank begins to beep
incessantly Garrett begins to wheeze desperately for air
Things start to go black

INT MOTEL ROOM— EARLY MORNING

The Phantom wakes up in a cold sweat The alarm clock is
beeping incessantly It was just a dream

The Phantom puts his holsters on over his wife beater and
throws a button-down shirt on Leaving it open he throws on
a jacket Benny stirs
THE BLACK PHANTOM
Let’s go
INT PHANTOM’S ESCALADE- CONTINUOUS

The Phantom and Benny ride in silence

BENNY
This is funyou got any tunes
THE BLACK PHANTOM
The CDs are in the rear seat I
doubt youll like ‘em I don’t
have any white people music in
there

BENNY
No we listen to your music You
just don’t listen to ours

Benny pulls out a CD case and starts looking through the
selection

BENNY (CONTD)
Oh Biggie Smalls here we go

He grabs the CD and slides it in

THE BLACK PHANTOM
You like Biggie

BENNY
I love Biggie

“10 Crack Commandments” by Biggie Smalls begins to play

THE BLACK PHANTOM and BENNY
One two three four five six seven
eight nine

The Phantom smiles at Benny

THE BLACK PHANTOM and BENNY (CONT’D)
Uhh its the ten crack
commandments
What uhh uhh
Nigga cant tell me nothin bout
this coke uh-huh
Cant tell me nothin bout this
crack this weed
To my hustlin niggaz

The Phantom stops singing and stares at Benny
BENNY
Niggaz on the corner I aint forget
you niggaz
My triple beam niggaz

The Phantom immediately turns off the stereo

BENNY (CONTD)
Why’d you turn it off I thought
you liked Big

THE BLACK PHANTOM
I do like Big You can’t say
nigger

BENNY
I know that I said “nigga”

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Oh Well then that completely
takes the oppression out of it My
bad dawg

BENNY
Look if I’m singing it to a song
it’s fine Chris Rock said that
shit

THE BLACK PHANTOM
When you’re in Chris Rock’s car
you can say nigger or nigga as many
times as you want You can have a
big motherfucking nigger spelling
bee for all I care But when
you’re in my car you don’t say it

BENNY
You said it

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Im black

BENNY
Wouldn’t you say it’s a
contradictory standard when one
race of people is allowed to say a
word and another race of people is
not based solely on the color of
their skin

THE BLACK PHANTOM
If one of the races enslaved the
other race then yes

BENNY
I knew it I knew it would come
up You hang out with a black
person long enough and it always
comes back to slavery

(MORE )

BENNY (CONTD)
Well let me let you in on a little
secret Everyone that was
responsible for slavery is dead
because it happened a long fucking
time ago So you can sit around in
your own self pity and blame every
missed opportunity on the color of
you skin or you can pull yourself
up by your bootstraps-

The Phantom slams on the brakes and Benny goes flying into
the dashboard

BENNY (CONTD)
Ow That’s my head dick

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Oh no you did not just say that
shit to me “Pull myself up by my
bootstraps” You’re like one of
those rapists that goes back to the
victim and says “Come on it
wasn’t that bad” You don’t want
to change the problem of racism in
America you just want to say that
shit happened a long time ago
Shut up I can’t have a
conversation about discrimination
with you because you know nothing
about it

BENNY
I don’t know anything about
discrimination Um I’m Dutch

THE BLACK PHANTOM
This is such a stupid conversation
When you’re black that’s your
master status Let me ask you
something you ever felt like you
didn’t get a job because you were
Dutch You ever felt a boss
thinking “Well his resume looks
great but I really fucking hate
wooden shoes”

The Phantom starts driving again

BENNY
Are you kidding me I work
organized crime in New York City
There is no Dutch representation
(MORE)
BENNY (CONTD)
I can never get made because I’m
not Italian The Irish the Middle
Easterners blacks all use their
own guys Nobody wants a Bonnema

THE BLACK PHANTOM
What about that Dutch catDutch
Schultz He was Dutch

BENNY
Oh you mean Arthur Flegenheimer
He had to change it to Dutch
Schultz because no one would
respect his God given name

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Oh wow what adversity

BENNY
Do you have any idea how fucking
hard I had to work to get where I
am now And you want to talk about
master status Try going through
life with only nine fingers

THE BLACK PHANTOM
I thought we weren’t gonna bring up
the past anymore

BENNY
I’m not talking about how I got it
When a baby’s born everyone says
“Came out with all ten fingers and
all ten toes” And when you got
nine fingers that’s the first
thing people use to describe you
There are girls that will
exclusively date black men There
are no girls that will only date
nine-fingered guys

THE BLACK PHANTOM
A nine-fingered guy never got hung
for dating a white girl PS
You’ve had nine fingers for like a
week And if I want to hide the
fact that I’m black I can’t just
put on a glove

BENNY
All I’m saying is that this is
America You work hard and you can
do anything

(MORE )

BENNY (CONTD)
I mean hell look at Barack The
most powerful person in the world
is black What else do you peop-
you guys that was close- want

THE BLACK PHANTOM
That must have hurt your heart when
a black man was elected President

BENNY
I voted for Barack

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Bullshit

BENNY
No I did Seriously I did

THE BLACK PHANTOM
You probably just say that shit
‘cause it sounds good What was
your take on that “historic”
election

BENNY
Well if somebody would have told
me that a black man and a white man
would be running for the Presidency
in 2008 and one man’s slogan was
“Yes We Can” and the other man’s
slogan was “The Mac Is Back” I
definitely wouldn’t have been able
to match the two

The Phantom laughs

BENNY (CONTD)
Look I don’t love George Bush

THE BLACK PHANTOM
I do

BENNY
Why

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Because after his presidency white
people who would never vote for a
black man said “Hey what’s the
worst that could possibly happen”
I think he should be honored every
Black History Month

Benny laughs

BENNY
Now that we can have a
conversation if the “N-word” is
such a mean degrading spiteful
dehumanizing word then why do so
many black people use it so often

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Well I could tell you that that
word brings us together and there’s
a sense of community in the
oppression that we all struggle
through but that’s bullshit It’s
just a fun word to say

Pause

THE BLACK PHANTOM (CONT’D)
So whatever happened to Dutch
Schultz anyway

BENNY
He was shot to death with rusty
bullets

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Oooh That’s a bad way to go Who
did it

BENNY
The Italians killed the Dutchman

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Well looks like history might
repeat itself

INT GUN WAREHOUSE- A LITTLE BEFORE 900AM

An OLD MAN with a thick foreign accent sits watching
security cameras All of a sudden one of the cameras goes
static The old man hits the screen a couple times and
realizes that the connection has been pulled He turns
around a grabs a shotgun from another table

In the other camera feed unseen by the old man Benny walks
across the screen The old man goes to the back door
Pointing his gun he waits for the intruder A gun cocks off
screen Benny points the gun at the old man’s head

BENNY
Drop the shotgun old timer

The old man drops the gun The Phantom walks in through the
back door

OLD MAN
They told me you might come

BENNY
What’d they say

OLD MAN
They said “Watch out for a good
looking black man and a nine-
fingered white guy”

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Aw damnit

BENNY
I told you I fucking told you
“Good looking black man wow you
really got the short end of that
stick

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Why don’t you just pull yourself up
by your bootstraps

Benny shoots The Phantom a look
A little time cut to

The old man sits on the floor with one wrist handcuffed to a
pole Benny and The Phantom point their guns at him

THE BLACK PHANTOM (CONT’D)
So are we gonna kill this old man

BENNY
I don’t want to but I’m not gonna
have this whole thing undone
because we weren’t thorough

THE BLACK PHANTOM
True that

OLD MAN
I don’t think you should kill me
BENNY
No offense but your opinion’s a
little biased
(To the Phantom)
Alright if we kill this guy then
we don’t have to worry about him
tipping off Pascalli

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Well we could just incapacitate
him What he knows is good for the
next couple of hours

BENNY
But we’re gonna take a lot of these
guns right

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Of course

BENNY
Well if we take his guns he might
not be too happy about it and that
comes back on us later

THE BLACK PHANTOM
That is a very good point

OLD MAN
Pascalli took this warehouse three
weeks ago They’re his guns

BENNY

(To the Old Man)
Great rebuttal

(To the Phantom)
See what he did there He’s using
facts to win his argument He
didn’t bring any personal bullshit
in You could learn a lot from
this old man

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Yeah your nine finger tirades are
the reason I wanted to get into
impartial debating

BENNY
Oh shut up

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Shut up Great rebuttal You
learn that one at Dartmouth

BENNY
We’re no Grambling State-

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Don’t bring Grambling into this-

OLD MAN
If you’re going to kill me do it
Jesus Christ you faggots sound
like an old married couple
Benny and The Phantom smile

BENNY
We can’t kill this old man

THE BLACK PHANTOM
No we can’t

The Phantom looks over at the security cameras and sees Billy
at the door

THE BLACK PHANTOM (CONT’D)
Looks like our guest is arriving

Billy enters through the front door to find the old man still
handcuffed Benny and The Phantom are nowhere to be seen

BILLY

A hammer cocks and a gun is suddenly at Billy’s temple

BILLY (CONT’D)

A little time cut to

The Phantom stands over the old man A half empty bottle of
Nyquil sits on the floor next to the old man’s free hand

OLD MAN
I can’t drink an entire bottle of
NyQuil

THE BLACK PHANTOM
It’s better than the alternative

The old man continues to drink Pull out to see Benny with
Billy on the other side of the room Billy’s ankle is
chained to another pole The Phantom walks over to Benny

THE BLACK PHANTOM (CONT’D)
How you want to torture this fool

BENNY
We’re not

THE BLACK PHANTOM

BENNY
‘Cause I like Billy

Benny goes into his own jacket and takes out a syringe and
drug Benny prepares the drug

THE BLACK PHANTOM

BENNY
Nah it’s truth serum Ever seen
this stuff before

THE BLACK PHANTOM
Yeah the army uses it on white
prisoners

BENNY

A little time cut to
Benny puts the serum back in his jacket pocket

BENNY (CONTD)
We just have to wait for the pupils

Benny takes out a cigarette

BENNY (CONTD)
You want a cigarette Billy

BILLY
A cigarette Shit No Benny no

Benny puts the cigarette in Billy’s mouth and lights it for
him Billy’s pupils begin to dilate

BENNY

EXT COMMERCIAL PARKING GARAGE- LATER THAT MORNING

Nicky Pascalli gets into his car and drives away We pull
out to reveal The Phantom and Benny sitting in Billy’s car on
the roof of a parking garage across the street looking down
on Nicky with binoculars

BENNY
Where’s he going

THE BLACK PHANTOM
I dunno I’m gonna take a closer
Look

The Phantom gets out of the car and walks out of sight
Suddenly a hand with a rag comes through the window over
Benny’s mouth Benny struggles and then passes out

The Phantom walks back toward the car Ricardo is crouched
down in the backseat behind Benny When The Phantom gets
close Ricardo shoots him three times in the chest The

The Phantom is underneath the car holding on to the
undercarriage Ricardo starts to shoot the floor of the car
Shrapnel hits The Phantom in the face forcing him to let go

The Phantom rolls out from underneath the car and sees the
tail end go down the ramp The Phantom swings over the
railing down to the next level

INT COMMERCIAL PARKING GARAGE- CONTINUOUS

Ricardo drives the car right toward The Phantom The Phantom
shoots the windshield barely missing Ricardo’s head

Ricardo uses Benny as a shield Ricardo begins to return
fire and drive right toward the Phantom At the last second
the Phantom jumps on top of a neighboring parked car and onto
the roof of Ricardo’s car

RICARDO
Un-fucking-belivable

Ricardo shoots through the roof The Phantom punches through
the window grabs Ricardo’s gun and throws it out of the car
Ricardo grabs The Phantom’s arm Ricardo slams on the brake

and turns the wheel He lets go of The Phantom’s arm causing
him to fly off the car

The Phantom pulls his gun back out and shoot out all four
tires of the car Ricardo looses control of the car and
crashes into a wall The Phantom gets up points his gun at
the car and quickly charges over

to the crashed car starts The Phantom begins to run shoots
at the Jeep but it is blocked by Billy’s totaled car The

it and crashes right through the entrance gate and he and an
unconscious Benny are gone
