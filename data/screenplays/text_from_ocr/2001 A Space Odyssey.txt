AFRICA
3000000 YEARS AGO

VIEWS OF AFRICAN DRYLANDS - DROUGHT

The remorseless drought had lasted now for ten million years
and would not end for another million The reign of the ter-
rible lizards had long since passed but here on the continent
which would one day be known as Africa the battle for survival
had reached a new climax of ferocity and the victor was not
yet in sight In this dry and barren land only the small or
the swift or the fierce could flourish or even hope to exist

INT and EXT CAVES - MOONWATCHER

The man-apes of the field had none of these attributes and
they were on the long pathetic road to racial extinction
About twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking

a small parched valley divided by a sluggish brown stream

The tribe had always been hungry and now it was starving

As the first dim glow of dawn creeps into the cave Moonwatcher
discovers that his father has died during the night He did not know
the Old One was his father for such a relationship was beyond

his understanding but as he stands looking down at the emac-—

iated body he feels something something akin to sadness Then

he carries his dead father out of the cave and leaves him for the
hyenas

Among his kind Moonwatcher is almost a giant He is nearly
five feet high and though badly undernourished weighs over
a hundred pounds His hairy muscular body is quite man-like
and his head is already nearer man than ape The forehead is
low and there are great ridges over the eye-sockets yet he
unmistakably holds in his genes the promise of humanity As
he looks out now upon the hostile world there is already

a2

A2

something in his gaze beyond the grasp of any ape In those

dark deep-set eyes is a dawning awareness-the first intima-

tions of an intelligence which would not fulfill itself for another
two million years

EXT THE STREAM - THE OTHERS

As the dawn sky brightens Moonwatcher and his tribe reach
the shallow stream

The Others are already there They were there on the other
side every day - that did not make it any less annoying
There are eighteen of them and it is impossible to distinguish
them from the members of Moonwatchers own tribe As

they see him coming the Others begin to angrily dance and
shriek on their side of the stream and his own people reply

n kind

-

he confrontation lasts a few minutes - then the display dies
out as quickly as it has begun and everyone drinks his fill of
the muddy water Honor has been satisfied - each group has
staked its claim to its own territory

EXT AFRICAN PLAIN - HERBIVORES

Moonwatcher and his companions search for berries fruit

and leaves and fight off pangs of hunger while all around
them competing with them for the samr fodder is a potential
source of more food than they could ever hope to eat Yet

all the thousands of tons of meat roaming over the parched
savanna and through the brush is not only beyond their reach
the idea of eating it is beyond their imagination They are
slowly starving to death in the midst of plenty
a5

A5
EXT PARCHED COUNTRYSIDE - THE LION

The tribe slowly wanders across the bare flat country-
side foraging for roots and occasional berries

Eight of them are irregularly strung out on the open plain
about fifty feet apart

The ground is flat for miles around

Suddenly Moonwatcher becomes aware of a lion stalking
them about 300 yards away

Defenceless and with nowhere to hide they scatter in all
directions but the lion brings one to the ground

aé

AG
EXT DEAD TREE - FINDS HONEY

It had not been a good day though as Moonwatcher had no

real remembrance of the past he could not compare one day

with another But on the way back to the caves he finds a

hive of bees in the stump of a dead tree and so enjoys the
finest delicacy his people could ever know Of course he

also collects a good many stings but he scacely notices

them He is now as near to contentment as he is ever

likely to be for thought he is still hungry he is not actually
weak with hunger That was the most that any hominid could

hope for

al

AT
INT and EXT CAVES - NIGHT TERRORS

Over the valley a full moon rises and a cold wind blows down
from the distant mountains It would be very cold tonight -
but cold like hunger was not a matter for any real concern
it was merely part of the background of life

This Little Sun that only shone at night and gave no warmth
was dangerous there would be enemies abroad Moonwatcher
crawls out of the cave clambers on to a large boulder besides
the entrance and squats there where he can survey the valley
If any hunting beast approached he would have time to get back
to the relative safety of the cave

Of all the creatures who had ever lived on Earth Moonwatchers
race was the first to raise their eyes with interest to the Moon
and though he could not remember it when he was young
Moonwatcher would reach out and try to touch its ghostly face
Now he new he would have to find a tree that was high

enough

He stirs when shrieks and screams echo up the slope from
one of the lower caves and he does not need to hear the

a8

Al

occasional growl of the lion to know what is happening Down
there in the darkness old One-Eye and his family are dying
and the thought that he might help in some way never crosses
Moonwatchers mind The harsh logic of survival rules out
such fancies Every cave is silent lest it attract disaster

And in the caves in tortured spells of fitful dozing and
fearful waiting were gathered the nightmares of generations
yet to come

aQ

EXT THE STREAM - INVASION

The Others are growing desperate the forage on their side of
the valley is almost exhausted Perhaps they realise that
Moonwatchers tribe has lost three of its numbers during the
night for they choose this mourning to break the truce When
they meet at the river in the still misty dawn there is a
deeper and more menacing note in their challenge The noisy
but usually harmless confrontation lasts only a few seconds
before the invasion begins

In an uncertainly-moving horde the Others cross the river
shieking threats and hunched for the attack They are led

by a big-toothed hominid of Moonwatchers own size and age

Startled and frightened the tribe retreats before the first
advance throwing nothing more substantial than imprecations
at the invaders Moonwatcher moves with them his mind a
mist of rage and confusion To be driven from their own
territory is a great badness but to lose the river is death
He does not know what to do it is a situation beyond his
experience

Then he becomes dimly aware that the Others are slowing

al0

A8

down and advancing with obvious reluctance The further they
move from their own side the more uncertain and unhappy

they become Only Big-Tooth still retains any of his original
drive and he is rapidly being seperated from his followers

As he sees this Moonwatchers own morale immediately
revives He slows down his retreat and begins to make
reassuring noises to his companions Novel sensations fill
his dim mind - the first faint precursors of bravery and
leadership

Before he realizes it he is face to face with Big-Tooth and
the two tribes come to a halt many paces away

The disorganized and unscientific conflict could have ended
quickly if either had used his fist as a club but this
innovation still lay hundreds of thousands of years in the
future Instead the slowly weakening fighters claw and
scratch and try to bite each other

Rolling over and over they come to a patch of stony ground
and when they reach it Moonwatcher is on top By chance

all

A8

he chooses this moment to grab the hair on Big-Tooths scalp
and bang his head on the ground The resulting CRACK is

so satisfactory and produces such an immediate weakening

In Big - Tooths resistance that he quickly repeats it

Even when Big-Tooth ceases to move for some time Moon-
watcher keeps up the exhilirating game
With shrieks of panic the Others retreat back across the
stream The defenders cautiously pursue them as far as
The waters edge

al2
EXT CAVE - NEW SOUND

Dozing fitfully and weakened by his stuggle Moonwatcher is
startled by a sound

He sits up in the fetid darkness of the cave straining his
senses out into the night and fear creeps slowly into his soul
Never in his life - already twice as long as most members of

his species could expect - has he heard a sound like this The
great cats approached in silence and the only thing that
betrayed them was a rare slide of earth or the occasional
cracking of a twig Yet this is a continuing crunching noise
that grows steadily louder It seemed that some enormous

beast was moving through the night making no attempt at
concealment and ignoring all obstacles

And then there came a sound which Moonwatcher could not
possibly have identified for it had never been heard before
in the history of this planet

al3

Al10
EXT CAVE - NEW ROCK

Moonwatcher comes face to face with the New Rock when he

leads the tribe down to the river in the first light of morning
He had almost forgotten the terror of the night because nothing
had happened after that initial noise so he does not even
associate this strange thing with danger or with fear There

is nothing in the least alarming about it

It is a cube about fifteen feet on a side and it is made of
some completely transparent material indeed it is not easy
to see except when the light of the sun glints on its edges
There are no natural objects to which Moonwatcher can
compare this apparition Though he is wisely cautious

of most new things he does not hesitate to walk up to it
As nothing happens he puts out his hand and feels a warm
hard surface

After several minutes of intense thought he arrives at a
brilliant explanation It is a rock of course and it
must have grown during the night There are many plants
that do this - white pulpy things shaped like pebbles that
seem to shoot up in the hours of darkness It is true that
they are small and round whereas this is large and square

al4

Al10

but greater and later philosophers than Moonwatcher would be
prepared to overlook equally striking exceptions to their laws

This really superb piece of abstract thinking leads Moonwatcher
to a deduction which he immediately puts to the test The white
round pebble-plants are very tasty (though there were a few
that made one violently sick) perhaps this square one

A few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusion him
There is no nourishment here so like a sensible hominid he
continues on his way to the river and forgets all about the Cube

al5

All
EXT CUBE - FIRST LESSON

They are still a hundred yards from the New Rock when the
sound begins

It is quite soft and it stops them in their tracks so that they
stand paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging A simple
maddeningly repetitious rhythm pulses out of the crystal cube

and hypnotises all who come within its spell For the first

time - and the last for two million year - the sound of

drumming is heard in Africa

The throbbing grows louder more insistent Presently the
hominids begin to move forward like sleep-walkers towards
the source of that magnetic sound Sometimes they take little
dancing steps as their blood responds to the rhythms that
their descendants will not create for ages yet

Totally entranced they gather around the Cube forgetting
the hardships of the day the perils of the approaching dusk
and the hunger in their bellies

Now spinning wheels of light begin to merge and the spokes
fuse into luminous bars that slowly recede into the distance
alé

All

rotating on their axes as they do and the hominids watch wide-
eyed mesmerized captives of the Crystal Cube

Then by some magic - though it was no more magical than all
that had gone on before - a perfectly normal scene appears It
is as if a cubical block had been carved out of the day and
shifted into the night Inside that block is a group of four
hominids who might have been members of Moonwatchers

own tribe eating chunks of meat The carcass of a wart-hog
lies near them

This little family of male and female and two children is gorged
and replete with sleek and glossy pelts - and this was a
condition of life that Moonwatcher had never imagined From

time to time they stir lazily as they loll at ease near the
entrance of their cave apparently at peace with the world

The spectacle of domestic bliss merges into a totally

different scene

The family is no longer reposing peacefully outside its cave
it is foraging searching for food like any normal hominids

al7

All

A small wart-hog ambles past the group of browsing humanoids
without giving them more than a glance for they had never been
the slightest danger to its species

But that happy state of affairs is about to end The big male
suddenly bends down picks up a heavy stone lying at his feet -
and hurls it upon the unfortunate pig The stone descends upon
its skull making exactly the same noise that Moonwatcher had
produced in his now almost forgotten encounter with Big-Tooth
And the result too is much the same - the warthog gives one
amazed indignant squeal and collapses in a motionless heap

Then the whole sequence begins again but this time it unfolds
itself with incredible slowness Every detail of the movement
can be followed the stone arches leisurely through the air the
pig crumples up and sinks to the ground There the scene

freezes for long moments the slayer standing motionless

above the slain the first of all weapons in his hand
The scene suddenly fades out The cube is no more than a
glimmering outline in the darkness the hominids stir as if

al8

All

awakening from a dream realise where they are and scuttle
back to their caves

They have no concious memory of what they had seen but that

night as he sits brooding at the entrance of his lair his ears
attuned to the noises of the world around him Moonwatcher

feels the first faint twinges of a new and potent emotion - the urge
to kill He had taken his first step towards humanity

al9

A12
EXT cave AND PLAINS - Utopia

Babies were born and sometimes lived feeble toothless thirty-
year-olds died the lion took its toll in the night the Others
threatened daily across the river - and the trib prospered

n the course of a single year Moonwatcher and his companions
had changed almost beyond recognition

They had become as plump as the family in the Cave who no
longer haunted their dreams They had learned their lessons
well now they could handle all the stone tools and weapons that
the Cube had revealed to them

They were no longer half-numbed with starvation and they

had time both for leisure and for the first rudiments of thought
Their new way of life was casually accepted and they did

not associate it in any way with the crystal cube still standing
outside their cave

But no Utopia is perfect and this one had two blemishes The
first was the marauding lion whose passion for hominids
seemed to have grown even stronger now that they were better
nourished The second was the tribe across the river for

a20

A12

somehow the Others had survived and had stubbornly refused to
die of starvation

a21

Al13
EXT CAVES - KILLING THE LION

With the partly devoured carcass of a warthog laid out on the
ground at the point he hope the boulder would impact Moon-
watcher and three of his bravest companions wait for two
consecutive nights On the third the lion comes

betraying his presences by a small pebble slide

When they can here the lion below softly tearing at the meat
they strain themselves against the massive boulder The sound

of the lion stops he is listening Again they silently heave

against the enormous stone exerting the final limits of their
strength The rock begin to tip to a new balance point

The lion twitches alert to this sound but having no fear of these
creatures he makes the first of two mistakes which will cost
him his life he goes back to his meal

The rock moves slowly over the ledge picking up speed with
amazing suddeness It strikes a projection in the cliff about
fifteen feet above the ground which deflects its path outward

Just at this instant the lion reacts instinctively and leaps
away from the face of the cliff directly into the path of the

a22

Al13

onrushing boulder He has combined the errors of over-
confidence and bad luck

The next morning they find the lion in front of the cave They
also find one of their tribe who had incautiously peeped out to
see what was happening and was apparently killed by a small
rock torn loose by the boulder but this was a small price to
pay for such a great victory

kk kK Rk Rk Rk KK

And then one night the crystal cube was gone and not even
Moonwatcher ever thought of it again He was still wholly
unaware of all that it had done

a23

Al14
EXT STREAM - MASTER OF THE WORLD

From their side of the stream in the never violated safety of
their own territory the Others see Moonwatcher and fourteen
males of his tribe appear from behind a small hillock over-
looking the stream silhouetted against the dawn sky

The Others begin to scream their daily challenge But today
something is different though the Others do not immediatly
recognize this fact

Instead of joining the verbal onslaught as they had always done
Moonwatcher and his small band decended from the rise and

begin to move forward to the stream with a quiet purposefulness
never befor seen

As the Others watch the figures silently approaching in the
morning mist they become aware of the terrible strangness
of this encounter and their rage gradually subsides down to
an uneasy silence

At the waters edge Moonwatcher and his band stop They
carry their bone clubs and bone knives

a24

Al14

Led by One-ear the Others half-heartly resume the battle-
chant But they are suddenly confrunted with a vision that cuts
the sound from their throats and strikes terror into their
hearts

Moonwatcher who had been partly concealed by two males who
walked before him thrusts his arm high into the air In his
hand he holds a stoud tree branch Mounted atop the branch is
the bloody head of the lion its mouth jammed open with a stick
displaying its frightful fangs

The Others gape in fearful disbelief at this display of power
Moonwatchers stands motionless thrusting the lions head high

Then with majestic deliberation still carrying his mangled
standard above his head he begins to cross the stream followed
by his band

The Others fade back from the stream seeming to lack even
the ability to flee

Moonwatcher steps ashore and walks to One-Ear who stands

a25

Al14

unsurely in front of his band

Though he is a veteran of numerous combats at the waters edge
One-Ear has never been attacked by an enemy who had not first
displayed his fighting rage and he had never before been attacked
with a weapon One-Ear merely looks up at the raised club

until the heavey thigh bone of an antelope brings the darkness
down around him

The Others stare in wonder at Moonwatchers power
Moonwatcher surveys the scene Now he was master of the

world and he was not sure what to do next But he would
think of something

SMYSLOV
Are you by any chance going
up to your base at Clavius

FLOYD
Yesas a matter of fact I am

FLOYD
Is there any particular reason
why you ask

SMYSLOV

(pleasantly) Well Dr Floyd
I hope that you dont think Im
too inquisitive but perhaps
you can clear up the mystery
about whats been going on up
there

FLOYD
Im sorry but Im not sure
I know what you mean

Well its just for the past

some extremely odd things
happening at Clavius

Really

SMYSLOV

Yes Well for one thing
whenever you phone the base
all you can get is a recording
which repeats that the phone
lines are temporarily out of
order

FLOYD
Well I suppose theyve been
having a bit of trouble with
some of the equipment

SMYSLOV
Yes well at first we thought
that was the explanation but
its been going on for the past
ten days

FLOYD
You mean you havent been able
to get anyone at the base for

days

SMYSLOV
Thats right

Quite frankly we have had some

that a quite serious epidemic

Something apperently of an
unknown origin Is this in
fact what has happened

FLOYD

Im sorry Dr Smyslov but
Im really not at liberty to
discuss this

SMYSLOV

This epidemic could easily
spread to our base Dr Floyd
We should be given all the
facts

FLOYD
Dr Smyslov Im not
permitted to discuss this

I suppose it was bound to happen

Berkeley told me that they think
it came from contamination on a
returning Mars flight

Yes well whatever it is

certainly not fooling around

is the first flight they allowed
in for more than a week

CO-PILOT

I was working out what this trip
must cost taking him up there
by himself and coming back

Ill bet its a fortune

up at Clavius

Yes well I wouldnt have been
too concerned about it except
Ive heard these stories about

epidemic and as a matter of

Ive heard that ten people have
died already

FLOYD
I wish I could be more helpful
Captain but as Ive said I

think theres any cause for
alarm

PILOT

Well fine Thanks very much

HALVORSEN

Ladies and gentlemen I should
like to introduce Dr Heywood
Floyd a distinguished member
of the National Council of
Astronautics He has just
completed a special flight here
from Earth to be with us and
before the briefing he would
like to say a few words Dr
Floyd

FLOYD

First of all I bring a personal
message from Dr Howell who

has asked me to convey his
deepest appreciation to all of
you for the personal sacrifices
you have made and of course

his congratulations on your
discovery which may well prove
to be among the most significant
in the history of science

FLOYD (contd)

Mr Halvorsen has made known

to me some of the conflicting
views held by many of you
regarding the need for complete
security in this matter and
more specifically your strong
opposition to the cover story
created to give the impression
Base

being

112565
b55

B38

there is an epidemic at the
I understand that beyond it

a matter of principle many of
you are troubled by the concern
and anxiety this story of an
epidemic might cause your
relatives and friends on Earth

I can understand and sympathize
with your negative views I have
been personally embarrassed by
this cover story But I fully
accept the need for absolute
secrecy and I hope you will

It should not be difficult for
of you to realise the potential

cutural shock and social
disorientation contained in the
present situation if the facts
were prematurely and suddenly
made public without adequate
preparation and conditioning

FLOYD

This is the view of the Council
and the purpose of my visit here
is to gather addition facts and
opinions on the situation and to
prepare a report to the Council
recommending when and how the
news should eventually be
announced Are there any
questions

MICHAELS

this can be kept under wraps

Dave if youve a minute Id
like
your advice on something
BOWMAN
Sure what is it
POOLE
Well its nothing really
important
but its annoying
BOWMAN
Whats up
POOLE
Its about my salary cheques
BOWMAN
Yes
POOLE
Well I got the papers on my
official up-grading to AGS-19
two weeks before we left
121465

BOWMAN
Yes I remember you mentioning
it
I got mine about the same time
POOLE
Thats right Well naturally
I didnt say anything to
Payroll
I assumed theyd start paying me
at the higher grade on the next
pay

cheque But its been almost
problem

me

but

yours

for

might
and
that

differ-

three weeks now and Im still
being paid as an AGS-18

BOWMAN

Interesting that you mention it
because Ive got the same

POOLE
Really

BOWMAN
Yes

POOLE

Yesterday I finally called the
Accounting Office at Mission
Control and all they could tell
was that theyd received the
notification for the other three

not mine and apparently not

either

BOWMAN
Did they have any explanation

this

POOLE
Not really They just said it

be because we trained at Houston
they trained in Marshall and
were being charged against

ent accounting offices

BOWMAN
Its possible
POOLE
Well what do you think we ought
to do about it

BOWMAN
I dont think we should make any
fuss about it yet Im sure

theyll

straighten it out

POOLE

I must say I never did
understand

why they split us into two
groups

for training

BOWMAN

No I never did either
121465

cl14

c12

POOLE

We spent so little time with
them

I have trouble keeping their
names

straight

BOWMAN

I suppose the idea was
specialized

training

POOLE

I suppose so Though of course

theres a more sinister
explanation

BOWMAN

Oh

POOLE

Yes You must have heard the
rumour that went around during
orbital check-out

BOWMAN
No as a matter of fact I

didnt
POOLE
Oh well apparently theres
something about the mission that
the sleeping beauties know that
we dont know and thats why we
were trained separately and
thats why they were put to
sleep
before they were even taken
aboard
121465
c15
c12

BOWMAN
Well what is it
POOLE
I dont know All I heard is
that
theres something about the
mission we werent told
BOWMAN
That seems very unlikely
POOLE
Yes I thought so
BOWMAN
Of course it would be very easy
for us to find out now
POOLE
How
BOWMAN
Just ask Hal Its conceivable
they might keep something from
us but theyd never keep
anything
from Hal
POOLE

Thats true

BOWMAN
(sighs) Well its silly

if you want to why dont you

POOLE

Hal Dave and I believe that
theres something about the
mission that we werent told
Something that the rest of the
crew know and that you know
Wed like to know whether this
is true

HAL

Im sorry Frank but I dont
think I can answer that question
without knowing everything that
all of you know

BOWMAN
Hes got a point

POOLE
Okay then how do we re-phrase
the question

BOWMAN
Still you really dont believe

do you

POOLE
Not really Though it is

when you think about it It
think

us

inconceivable

impossible

Hal

121465

of

really make any sense to keep
us apart during training

BOWMAN
Yes but its to fantastic to

that theyd keep something from

POOLE
I know It would be almost
inconceivable

BOWMAN
But not completely

POOLE
I suppose it isnt logically

BOWMAN
I guess it isnt

POOLE
Still all we have to do is ask

BOWMAN
Well the only important aspect

the mission are where are we
going what will we do when we
get there when are we coming
back and why are we going

POOLE
Right Hal tell me whether the
following statements are true or
false

I will if I can Frank

HAL
Thats true

Approximately five years after

go into hibernation the

vehicle will make rendezous with
us and bring us back Is this

I wouldnt worry too much about
the computer First of all
there is still a chance that he
is right despite your tests
and if it should happen again
we suggest eliminating this
possibility by allowing the unit
to remain in place and seeing
whether or not it actually

If the computer should turn out
to be wrong the situation is
still not alarming The type

of obsessional error he may be
guilty of is not unknown among
the latest generation of HAL
9000 computers

It has almost always revolved
around a single detail such as
the one you have described and
it has never interfered with the
integrity or reliability of the
computers performance in

other areas

No one is certain of the cause
of this kind of malfunctioning
It may be over-programming

X-ray-delta-zero to MC zero-

has just reported another
predicted failure off the AAC-
unit As you suggested we

are going to wait and see if it
fails but we are quite sure
there is nothing wrong with

the unit

If a reasonable waiting period
proves us to be correct we
feel now that the computer
reliability has been seriously
impaired and presents an
unacceptable risk pattern to
the mission

We believe under these
circumstances it would be
advisable to disconnect the
computer from all ship
operations and continue the
mission under Earth-based
computer control

If you do that now without Earth

I am prepared to do that anyway

I know that youve had that on

The purpose of this mission is

more than to carry out a
continuation of the space

and further our general
of the planets Is this true

HALS VOICE
That is true

SIMONSON

Well Im afaid Hal was lying
He had been programmed to lie
about this one subject for

ity reasons which well explain
later

The true purpose of the Mission
was to have been explained to

by Mission Commander Kaminsky
on his revival Hal knew this

he knew the actual mission but
he couldnt tell you the truth

you challenged him Under orders

121365
c121

C148

SIMONSON (cont)
from earth he was forced to lie

In everything except this he had
the usual reinforced truth

ming

We believe his truth programming
and the instructions to lie
gradually resulted in an
incompatible conflict and
facedc with this dilemman he
developed for want of a better
description neurotic symptoms

Its not difficult to suppose
these symptoms would centre on
the communication link with
Earth for he may have blamed

us for his incompatible program-
ming

Following this lin of thought
suspected that the last straw
was the possibility of

Since he became operational he

never known unconsciousness It
must have seemed the equivalent

death

At this point he presumably

took whatever actions he thought
appropriate to protect himself
from what must have seemed to
him to be his human tormentors

If I cane speak in human terms
I dont think we can blame him
too much We have ordered him
to disobey his conscience

Well thats it Its very
speculative but we think it is
a possible explanation Anyway
good luck on the rest of the

Good day gentlemen When you

Saturn I hope that youve hada
pleasant and uneventful trip and
that the rest of your mission
continues in the same manner I
should like to fill you in on
more of the details on which
Mission Commander Kaminsky

will have already briefed you
Thirteen months before the

date of your Saturn mission on
April 12th 2001 the first

for intelligent life outside the
was discovered

It was found buried at a depth
fifteen metres in the crater

No news of this was ever

and the event had been kept
secret since then for reasons

I will later explain

Soon after it was uncovered it
emitted a powerful blast of

FLOYD (cont)

radiation in the radio spectrum
which seems to have triggered
by the Lunar sunrise

Luckily for those at the site

proved harmless

Perhaps you can imagine our
astonishment when we later found
it was aimed precisely at

A lot of thought went into the
question of wether or not it was
sun-triggered as it seemed
illogical to deliberately bury a
sun-powered device

Burying it could only shield it
from the sun since its intense
magnetic field made it otherwise
easily detectable

We finally concluded that the
reason you might bury a sun-
powered device would be to keep
it inactive until it would be

uncovered at which time it

absorb sunlight and trigger

FLOYD

What is its purpose I wish we
knew The object was buried on
the moon about four million

ago when our ancestors were
primative man-apes

Weve examined dozens of

but the one that has the most

currency at the moment is that
the object serves as an alarm

whether the alarm represents
any danger to us These are
questions no one can answer
The intentions of an alien

at least four million years

than we are cannot be reliably
predicted

In view of this the

and scientific communities felt
that any public announcment
might lead to significant

shock and disorientation

Discussion took place at the
highest levels between govern-

FLOYD (cont)
ments and it was decided that

only wise and precautionary
course to follow was to assume
that the intentions of this

world are potentially dangerous
to us until we have evidence to
the contrary

This is of course why security
has been maintained and why

this information has been kept
on a need-to-know basis

NARRATOR (cont)

Those who had begun the expri-
ment so long ago had not been
men

But when they looked out across
the deeps of space they felt
awe and wonder - and loneliness

In their explorations they
encountered life in many forms
and watched on a thousand worlds
the workings of evolution

They saw how often the first

sparks of intelligence flickered
and died in the cosmic night

And because in all the galaxy
they had found nothing more
precious than Mind they
encouraged its dawning every-
wnere

The great Dinosaurs had long
since perished when their ships
entered the solar system after
a voyage that had already lasted
thousands of years

NARRATOR (cont)
They swept past the frozen

planets paused briefly above

deserts of dying Mars and
presently looked down on

Earth
For years they studied
collected
and catalogued
When they had learned all
they
could they began to modify
They tinkered with the
destiny
of many species on land and
in
the ocean but which of their
experiments would succeed
they could not know for at
least
a million years
They were patient but they
were
not yet immortal There was
much to do in this Universe
ofa
hundred billion stars So
they
set forth once more across
the
abyss knowing that they
would
never come this way again
Nor was there any need Their
wonderful machines could be
trusted to do the rest

With a yet slower rhythm than

Strange and beautiful and

empires rose and fell and

Earth was not forgotten but it
one of a million silent worlds
few of which would ever speak
Then the first explorers of
recognising the limitations of
their minds and bodies passed
on their knowledge to the great
machines they had created and

who now trnscended them in
every way

For a few thousand years they
shared their Universe with their
machine children then

their task was done they passed
into history without regret

Now they were Lords of the
galaxy and beyond the reach

They could rove at will among
stars and sink like a subtle

through the very interstices of
space

NARRATOR (cont)
But despite their God-like

they still watched over the
experiments their ancestors
had started so many generations
ago

The companion of Saturn knew
nothing of this as it orbited
in its no mans land between
and the outer edge of rings

It had only to remember and

and to look forever Sunward with
its strange senses

it would not have known the
slightest trace of

it was prepared to wait for

Presently it felt the gentle

Soon these gave way to more

The great machine knew that this

too primative a device to detect
the forces that were gathering
round it now

Then the pod came carrying
life The great machine searched
its memories

The logic circuits made their
decision when the pod had fallen
