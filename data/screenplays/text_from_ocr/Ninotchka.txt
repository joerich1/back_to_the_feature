SHOOTING DRAFT

FADE IN ON

AN ESTABLISHING SHOT OF PARIS IN THE MONTH OF APRIL

THE LUXURIOUS LOBBY OF THE HOTEL CLARENCE
CAMERA MOVES to a CLOSE SHOT of the desk In the

is a revolving door leading to the street Through the
revolving door comes a strangely dressed individual

one who doesnt belong in such surroundings It is
Buljanoff a member of the Russian Board of Trade

the spring climate of Paris he still wears his typical
Russian clothes consisting of a coat with a fur

fur cap and heavy boots
Buljanoff glances around the lobby obviously over-
by its magnificence The Manager puzzled by
strange appearance approaches him
MANAGER
(politely)

Is there anything I can do for you

returning

BULJANOFF
No no

He exits toward the street The Manager returns to his
customary duties when suddenly a second Russian

dressed pushes his way through the door and gazes
It is Comrade Iranoff
The Manager definitely mystified by now approaches
MANAGER
Yes monsieur

IRANOFF
Just looking around

Iranoff exits Again the Manager returns to his duties

suddenly he sees that a third man dressed in the same
fashion has appeared in the revolving door It is

Kopalski
Kopalski doesnt leave the revolving door at all but as
turns drinks in the whole spectacle of the lobby The
is by now dumfounded
STREET IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL CLARENCE
A taxi stands at the curb Buljanoff and Iranoff are
beside it Iranoff holding a suitcase Kopalski
from the hotel joins the group
KOPALSKI
Comrades why should we lie to each
other Its wonderful
IRANOFF
Lets be honest Have we anything
like it in Russia
ALL THREE

(agreeing with him)
No no no
IRANOFF
Can you imagine what the beds would
be in a hotel like that

KOPALSKI
They tell me when you ring once the
valet comes in when you ring twice
you get the waiter and do you know
what happens when you ring three
times A maid comes in -- a French
maid

IRANOFF
(with a gleam in his
eye)
Comrades if we ring nine times
lets go in

BULJANOFF

(stopping him)
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I
have nothing against the idea but I
still say lets go back to the Hotel
Terminus Moscow made our reservations
there we are on an official mission
and we have no right to change the
orders of our superior

IRANOFF
Where is your courage Comrade
Buljanoff

KOPALSKI

Are you the Buljanoff who fought on
the barricades And now you are afraid
to take a room with a bath

BULJANOFF
(stepping back into
the taxi)
I dont want to go to Siberia

Iranoff and Kopalski follow him reluctantly

IRANOFF
I dont want to go to the Hotel
Terminus

KOPALSKI

If Lenin were alive he would say
Buljanoff Comrade for once in
your life youre in Paris Dont be
a fool Go in there and ring three
times

IRANOFF
He wouldnt say that What he would
say is Buljanoff you cant afford
to live in a cheap hotel Doesnt
the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean
anything to you Do you want to live
in a hotel where you press for the
hot water and cold water comes and
when you press for the cold water
nothing comes out at all Phooey
Buljanoff

BULJANOFF
(weakening)
I still say our place is with the
common people but who am I to
contradict Lenin Lets go in

All three start to leave the taxi as we

DISSOLVE TO
LOBBY -- HOTEL CLARENCE -- AT THE DESK

Buljanoff Iranoff and Kopalski are approaching the
Manager
their only suitcase carried by two of them

KOPALSKI
Are you the manager

MANAGER
(eyeing the three
suspiciously)
Yes

KOPALSKI
Pardon me for introducing Comrade
Iranoff member of the Russian Board
of Trade

MANAGER
(bowing with strained
politeness)
Monsieur

IRANOFF
This is Comrade Kopalski
noted the

MANAGER
Monsieur

BULJANOFF
I am Comrade Buljanoff

MANAGER
Monsieur

BULJANOFF
May I ask how much your rooms are

MANAGER
(trying to get rid of
them)
Well gentlemen Im afraid our rates
are rather high

BULJANOFF
Why should you be afraid

The other two nod their agreement The Manager has

single suitcase

MANAGER
(haughtily)
I might be able to accommodate you
Is there some more luggage

IRANOFF
Oh yes but have you a safe here
big enough to hold this

MANAGER
Im afraid we have no boxes of that
size in our vault but there is one
suite with a private safe

IRANOFF
Thats even better

MANAGER
But gentlemen I am afraid

BULJANOFF
Hes always afraid

The other two exchange a look of agreement again

MANAGER
(a little annoyed)
I just wanted to explain The
apartment may suit your convenience
but I doubt that it will fit your
convictions Its the Royal Suite

The mention of the Royal Suite startles the three

BULJANOFF
Royal Suite
(To the manager)
Just a minute

The Three Russians take a step away from the manager
and go
into a huddle

BULJANOFF
(in a low voice)
Now Comrades I warn you if it
gets out in Moscow that we stay in
the Royal Suite we will get into
terrible trouble

IRANOFF
(defending his right
to a good time)
Well just say we had to take it on
account of the safe Thats a perfect
excuse There was no other safe big
enough

The other two welcome the suggestion with relish

BULJANOFF AND IRANOFF
Thats right Good very good

Suddenly Buljanoff grows skeptical again

BULJANOFF
Of course we could take out the
pieces and distribute them in three
or four boxes in the vault and take
a small room Thats an idea isnt
it

For a moment all three see their bright plans crumble
Then
Iranoff comes to the rescue

IRANOFF
Yes its an idea but who says we

Thats all right

Swana sits at her dressing table in a negligee Leon
enters
with the easy air of an old friend He kisses her
lightly
SWANA
Hello Leon
LEON
Good morning Swana
During Swanas long speech he sits down not paying
much
attention to her patter lights a cigarette and
glances

through a magazine
SWANA
Its really a wretched morning
wretched I cant get myself right
I wanted to look mellow and I look
brittle My face doesnt compose
well all highlights how can I
dim myself down Leon Suggest
something I am so bored with this
face I wish I had someone elses
face Whose face would you have if
you had your choice Oh well I
guess one gets the face one deserves

LEON
Your conversation has one marvelous
advantage Swana However many
questions you ask you never expect
an answer

SWANA
Dont you find that restful Why
didnt you come last night

LEON
Darling I was busy looking out for
your interests

SWANA
Did you win

LEON
(enthusiastically)
We can forget horse racing roulette
the stock market our worries are

over You remember that platinum
watch with the diamond numbers You
will be in a position to give it to
me

SWANA
(with humor)
Oh Leon you are so good to me
(She kisses him)

LEON
We can be rich if you say the word
I had dinner with the Guizots last
night

SWANA
(contemptuously)
Those newspaper people
LEON
Youd be surprised how many nice
people dine with the Guizots

SWANA
What a gruesome proof of the power
of the press

LEON
Now listen Swana I sold Monsieur
Guizot the idea of publishing your
memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne
The Life and Loves of the Grand
Duchess Swana of Russia

SWANA
(protestingly)
Oh Leon
LEON

Sweetheart we wont have to bother
about our future if you are willing
to raffle off your past

SWANA
Was it for this that I refused to
endorse Dr Bertrands Mouthwash I
could have made a little fortune by
saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner
was the only vacuum cleaner ever
used by the Romanoffs and now you
want them to smear my lifes secrets
over the front page of a tabloid

LEON
I understand how you feel but there
is a limit to everything particularly
pride and dignity They are willing
to pay any price They have a
circulation of two million

SWANA
Imagine two million clerks and shop
girls peeking into my life for a
sou Think of my lovely life being
wrapped around cheese and blood
sausages I can see a big grease
spot in the midst of my most intimate
moments

Leon knows on which note to play for Swanas benefit
LEON

Well I am the last person to persuade
you but dont do it blindly if
this is your decision you must be
prepared to face the consequences

(With the expression

of a man ready to

give his all)
I will have to go to work

Swana rises and goes over to Leon His method has been
highly
successful

SWANA
My little Volga boatman Stop
threatening I dont deserve this
(Embracing him)
Are you my little Volga boatman

LEON
Now Swana

SWANA
First tell me are you my little
Volga boatman

LEON

SWANA
(puzzled)
Why do you bring this up after so
many years

RAKONIN

is some objection

from Cornillon)
But they are my jewels There
must be some way of getting them
back

LEON
(just as nervous as
Swana)
What does he say

SWANA
(to Leon)
Shhh
(into phone)
But how can there be a question
Are you my lawyer or theirs All
right Ill let you know

She hangs up rises the legal situation whirling
around in
her brain

LEON
What did he say

SWANA
(discouraged)
It looks pretty hopeless there
may be a chance thats all The

French Government has recognized
Soviet Russia and he doubts that
they will risk a war for my poor
sake He might be able to make up
some kind of a case but it would

cost money money money Thats
all they are interested in -- those
lawyers
LEON

arms)

Darling calm down Why do you need
a lawyer Havent you your little
Volga boatman

IRANOFF

who are pressed for money

MERCIER

Russian commission in New York trying
to sell fifteen Rembrandts There is
another in London mortgaging the oil
fields in Baku You need money and

Who are you What do you want What
is this

LEON
These jewels are the property of the
Duchess Swana of Russia and were
seized illegally by the Soviet
Government I am acting for Her
Highness the Duchess Here is my
power of attorney

He hands it to Mercier who reads it

IRANOFF
(excitedly)
You know Monsieur Mercier this is
all non-sense

KOPALSKI
These may have been the jewels of
the Duchess Swana but like all
private property they were
confiscated by the State

LEON
Well leave the problem of their
ownership to the French courts
Meanwhile I have filed a petition
for an injunction to prohibit you
from either selling or removing the
jewels Here is a copy

The Russians take the copy of the injunction

title approved by the French courts
the deal is settled Until then

He bows and starts toward the door Leon accompanies
opening the door as though he were the host

KOPALSKI

KOPALSKI
We havent anything to discuss with
you Well talk to a lawyer

LEON
All right -- go ahead you talk to

IRANOFF

LOBBY -- HOTEL CLARENCE

Manager at desk Iranoff Buljanoff and Kopalski rush
from

the direction of the elevator Iranoff pauses at the
desk

The others go on to the door and wait for him there

IRANOFF
(to Manager)
A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow
Hell occupy the Royal Suite Move

got
MANAGER

IRANOFF
Right away instantly

From the door Buljanoff and Kopalski call impatiently

BULJANOFF AND KOPALSKI
Iranoff

IRANOFF

As he starts toward the door we

DISSOLVE TO
PLATFORM -- PARIS RAILROAD STATION

The train has already arrived as the Three Russians

hurry
down the platform Neither do they know the name of the
Envoy
Extraordinary nor his appearance and they are
searching
the crowd for some clue
IRANOFF
This is a fine thing Maybe weve
missed him already
KOPALSKI
How can you find somebody without
knowing what he looks like
Iranoff points to a bearded man with a knapsack
IRANOFF
That must be the one
BULJANOFF
Yes he looks like a comrade
They follow the man but just as they are ready to
approach
him he is greeted by a German Girl Both raise their
hands

in the Nazi salute

BEARDED MAN AND GIRL
Heil Hitler

As the two embrace the Three Russians stop in their

tracks
KOPALSKI
No thats not him
BULJANOFF
Positively not
By now the platform is almost empty As the Russians in
the
foreground look around helplessly we see in the
background
a woman who obviously is also looking for someone It
is

Ninotchka Yakushova the Envoy Extraordinary The
Russians

exchange troubled looks and go toward her Ninotchka
comes

forward As they meet she speaks

NINOTCHKA
(to Iranoff)
am looking for Michael Simonovitch
ranoff

IRANOFF

NINOTCHKA

KOPALSKI
If we had known we would have greeted
you with flowers

NINOTCHKA
(sternly)
Dont make an issue of my womanhood
We are here for work all of us

Lets not waste time Shall we go
The Russians are taken aback As Ninotchka bends down
lift her two suitcases Iranoff calls

IRANOFF
Porter

A Porter steps up to them

PORTER

NINOTCHKA
What do you want

PORTER
May I have your bags madame

NINOTCHKA

KOPALSKI
He is a porter He wants to carry
them
NINOTCHKA

Why Why should you carry other

peoples bags

KOPALSKI
(trying to take
Ninotchkas bags)
Allow me Comrade

NINOTCHKA
No thank you

Ninotchka takes both suitcases and walks away with the
Russians whose nervousness has increased with every
from the Envoy Extraordinary

BULJANOFF
How are things in Moscow

NINOTCHKA
Very good The last mass trials were
a great success There are going to
be fewer but better Russians

The hearts of the Three Russians drop to their boots

LOBBY -- HOTEL CLARENCE
Ninotchka followed by the Russians comes through the

observing every detail of these unfamiliar

Suddenly she stops In the showcase of a hat shop in
lobby is displayed a hat of the John-Frederics type

NINOTCHKA
Whats that

KOPALSKI
Its a hat Comrade a womans hat

Ninotchka shakes her head
NINOTCHKA

Tsk tsk tsk how can such a
civilization survive which permits
women to put things like that on
their heads It wont be long now
Comrades

She walks out of the shot toward the elevator followed
by
the Three Russians as we

DISSOLVE TO
ROYAL SUITE

Ninotchka enters followed by the Three Russians who
by now
are frightened to death

BULJANOFF
This is the apartment we have reserved
for you Comrade Yakushova I hope
you like it

NINOTCHKA
(glancing around the
tremendous room)
Which part of the room is mine

IRANOFF
You see it is a little different
here They dont rent rooms in pieces
We had to take the whole suite

Ninotchka begins to unpack her things and puts her
typewriter
on the desk

NINOTCHKA
How much does this cost

IRANOFF
Two thousand francs

NINOTCHKA
A week

IRANOFF
A day

NINOTCHKA

Do you know how much a cow costs
Comrade Iranoff
Ninotchka

IRANOFF
A cow

NINOTCHKA

Two thousand francs If I stay here
a week I will cost the Russian people
seven cows

(with an outburst of

emotion)
Who am I to cost the Russian people
seven cows

BULJANOFF
We had to take it on account of the
safe

IRANOFF
For ourselves we are much happier
now since we moved to a little room
next to the servants quarters

takes Lenins picture from her bags

NINOTCHKA

I am ashamed to put the picture of
Lenin in a room like this

(she puts the

photograph on the

desk)
Comrades your telegram was received
with great disfavor in Moscow

KOPALSKI
We did our best Comrade

NINOTCHKA
I hope so for your sake
(she sits at her desk
and starts to type
her report)
Let us examine the case What does
the lawyer say

BULJANOFF
Which lawyer

NINOTCHKA
You didnt get legal advice

BULJANOFF
We didnt want to get mixed up with
lawyers They are very expensive
here If you just say hello to a
lawyer well there goes another
cow

KOPALSKI
We dealt directly with the
representative of the Grand Duchess
I am sure if we call him he will
give you a very clear picture

NINOTCHKA
I will not repeat your mistake I
will have no dealings with the Grand
Duchess nor her representative

Ninotchka continues to type The Three Russians watch

her
nervously Each click pounds on their consciences
NINOTCHKA
(looking up)
Comrade Buljanoff
BULJANOFF
Yes Comrade
NINOTCHKA
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or
two f£s
BULJANOFF
(with fright in his
voice)
With two fs if you please
Ninotchka goes on with her typing Suddenly she looks
up at
Iranoff who becomes self-conscious and fixes his tie
As he
does so he sees that Ninotchkas glance is concentrated
on
the spats which he was wearing and in his hurry forgot
to
remove He knows it is too late to do anything about it
except
to stand one foot behind the other as Ninotchka types
faster
the clicking of her keys twice as loud Ninotchka picks
up
the telephone

NINOTCHKA
(into phone)

Will you send me some cigarettes
please

(suddenly getting up)
Comrades I am not in a position to
pass final judgment but at best you
have been careless in your duty to
the State

(with utmost gravity)

You were entrusted with more than a
mere sale of jewelry Why are we
peddling our precious possessions to
the world at this time Our next
years crop is in danger and you
know it Unless we can get foreign
currency to buy tractors there will
not be enough bread for our people
And you three comrades

KOPALSKI
We did it with the best intentions

NINOTCHKA
We cannot feed the Russian people on
your intentions Fifty per cent to a
so-called Duchess Half of every
loaf of bread to our enemy Comrade
Kopalski go at once to our Embassy
and get the address of the best lawyer
in Paris

KOPALSKI
Yes Comrade

NINOTCHKA
You Comrade Iranoff go to the Public
Library and get me the section of
the Civil Code on property

BULJANOFF
Is there anything I can do Comrade

NINOTCHKA
You might get me an accurate map of
Paris I want to use my spare time
to inspect the public utilities and
make a study of all outstanding
technical achievements in the city

BULJANOFF
Yes Comrade
The buzzer rings

NINOTCHKA
Come in

The three Cigarette Girls enter

CIGARETTE GIRLS

Hello Hello Cigarettes

Ninotchka looks up astonished Seeing her the

Gladly

NINOTCHKA
How long do we have to wait here

LEON
Well -- until the policeman whistles
again

NINOTCHKA

At what intervals does he whistle

LEON
What

NINOTCHKA
How many minutes between the first
and second whistle

LEON
Thats funny Its interesting I
never gave it a thought before

NINOTCHKA
Have you never been caught ina
similar situation

LEON
Have I Do you know when I come to
think about it its staggering If I
add it all up I must have spent years
waiting for signals Imagine An
important part of my life wasted
between whistles

NINOTCHKA
In other words you dont know

LEON
No

NINOTCHKA
Thank you

LEON
Youre welcome
Ninotchka gets out her map starts to unfold it

LEON
Can I help you

NINOTCHKA
You might hold this for me

LEON
Love to

NINOTCHKA
(engrossed in her
geography)
Correct me if I am wrong We are
facing north arent we

LEON
(bewildered)
Facing north Id hate to commit
myself without my compass Pardon
me are you an explorer
NINOTCHKA
No I am looking for the Eiffel
Tower
LEON
s that thing lost again Listen

if you are interested in a view

NINOTCHKA
am interested in the Eiffel Tower
from a technical standpoint

LEON

Technical I couldnt help you
from that angle You see a real
Parisian only goes to the top of the
tower in moments of despair to jump
off

fq

NINOTCHKA
How long does it take a man to land

LEON
Now isnt that too bad The last
time I jumped I forgot to clock it
(looks at map)
Let me see Eiffel Tower Your
finger please
He takes her finger and points to the map with it
NINOTCHKA

(skeptically)
Why do you need my finger

LEON
Bad manners to point with your own
Here the Eiffel Tower

NINOTCHKA

And where are we

LEON
(shifting her finger
back to the hotel)

Here here we are here you are
and here I am feel it
NINOTCHKA

I am interested only in the shortest
distance between these two points
Must you flirt

LEON
I dont have to but I find it natural

NINOTCHKA
Suppress it

LEON
Ill try

Ninotchka starts to fold her map

NINOTCHKA
For my own information would you
call your approach toward me typical
of the local morale

LEON
Madame it is that kind of approach
which has made Paris what it is

NINOTCHKA
You are very sure of yourself arent
you

LEON

Nothing has occurred recently to
shake my confidence

NINOTCHKA
I have heard of the arrogant male in
capitalistic society It is having a
superior earning power that makes
you like that

LEON
A Russian I love Russians Comrade
I have been fascinated by your Five-
Year Plan for the past fifteen years

ATTENDANT
You dont have to worry The thing
is safe
NINOTCHKA
I am not afraid I want to know

Leon who apparently has taken a taxi and prepared
himself
otherwise enters the scene reading from a book

LEON

(reading)
The foundation is one hundred and
forty-one yards square

(he tips his hat and

interjects)
I hope youll forgive me but I thought
youd
NINOTCHKA
(interrupting)
Go ahead

The CAMERA goes with Ninotchka and Leon as they walk
toward
the steps

LEON

(continuing)
Four massive piers of masonry are
sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on
the side of the Seine and twenty-
nine and one-half feet on the other
side The girders of interlaced iron-
work which stay the structure have
an inclination of fifty-four
degrees

NINOTCHKA
Thats a strange angle

LEON
Yes very strange

By now they have reached the staircase They start up

LEON

(continuing to read)
Ascending to the tower is a staircase
consisting of eight hundred and twenty-
nine steps

(this disclosure

frightens Leon as he

realizes the climb

ahead of him He

reads on as they

walk up)
and an additional two hundred and
fifty-four steps to the very top

(now Leon stops but

Ninotchka proceeds

on out of the picture

Leon calls after her

and reads from his

book in a loud voice)
There is an elevator included in the
price of admission

Ninotchka continues to climb

he

sees Ninotchka who stands at the balustrade
overlooking

Paris She has climbed the tower faster than he despite
the

elevator Dumbfounded Leon approaches her Ninotchka
turns

very matter-of-fact

NINOTCHKA
You gave me some very valuable
information Thank you

LEON
(looking at the
dazzling view)
And thank you for getting me up here
Ive never seen this before
Beautiful isnt it
NINOTCHKA
Yes it is

LEON
Im glad I saw it before becoming
extinct

NINOTCHKA

Do not misunderstand me I do not
hold your frivolity against you
(she looks him up and
down)
As basic material you might not be
bad but you are the unfortunate
product of a doomed culture I feel
sorry for you

LEON
You must admit that this doomed old
civilization sparkles It glitters

Night View of Paris with Its Lights Ablaze as seen
from the
Eiffel Tower

NINOTCHKA AND LEON
NINOTCHKA

I do not deny its beauty but it is
a waste of electricity

LEON
What a city There are the Grands
Boulevards blasted out of the
heart of the old streets The Arc de
Triomphe made to greet Napoleons
army The Opera And Montmartre
Montparnasse La Boheme and now

Ill show you the greatest attraction
(he steps toa
telescope and taking
some money from his
pocket drops a coin
in the slot)
It will cost me a franc but it is
worth it
(he adjusts the
telescope)
The most wonderful spot in all Paris --
unique Here look
(she looks in telescope)
What do you see
NINOTCHKA
I see a house that looks like any
other house Whats remarkable about
it

LEON
Its not the structure but the spirit
which dwells within There are three
rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to
hospitality

NINOTCHKA
So that is your house

LEON
Well lets say I live in it Sucha
pleasant place all kinds of

comfort easy to reach close to
street car bus and subway

NINOTCHKA
(straight from the
shoulder)
Does that mean that you want me to
go there

LEON
(feeling that he has
offended her)
Please dont misunderstand me

NINOTCHKA
Then you dont want me to go there

LEON
(in a pickle)
Now I didnt say that either
naturally nothing would please me
more

NINOTCHKA
(simply)
Then why dont we go
(looking at him)
You might be an interesting subject
of study

LEON
Good evening Gaston

GASTON
Good evening Monsieur

NINOTCHKA
Is this what you call the butler

LEON
Yes

NINOTCHKA
(takes Gastons hand)
Good evening comrade
(to Leon)
This man is horribly old You should
not make him work

LEON
He takes good care of that

NINOTCHKA
He looks sad Do you whip him
LEON
No though the mere thought makes my
mouth water

NINOTCHKA
(to the completely
flabbergasted Gaston)
The day will come when you will be
free Go to bed little father We
want to be alone

Leon opens the door to the living room Ninotchka

enters
Just as he is about to follow her Gaston addresses
him

INTERIOR LIVING ROOM -- LEONS APARTMENT
Leon enters the room Closes the door Ninotchka is
examining
the room
LEON
Well may I offer you a drink or
how about something to eat
NINOTCHKA
Thank you Ive had all the calories
necessary for today
Leon feels a little uncertain as to how to approach
this

creature

NINOTCHKA
What do we do now

LEON
We take off our hat and coat
(he takes her things)
We sit down -- we make ourselves
comfortable We adjust ourselves to
the prospect of a most enjoyable
evening We look at each other We
smile

(Ninotchka doesnt

respond)
Well we dont smile How about
some music

NINOTCHKA
Is that customary

LEON
It helps It has ever since King
David wooed Bathsheba with the harp
As I am not so fortunate as to have
my harp at hand I shall turn on the
radio

NINOTCHKA
(the observer)
I should say this room is eighteen
by twenty-five

LEON
Not too big and not too small What
Id call the typical room of an
average man Or shall we say a little
above average Now if there are any
special aspects you wish to study I
have nothing to conceal Just look
around Thats my desk Those are my
books and here am I Where shall we
begin

NINOTCHKA
I will start with you

LEON
Thats great Im thirty-five years
old Just over six feet tall I weigh
a hundred and eighty-two pounds
stripped

NINOTCHKA
And what is your profession

LEON
Keeping my body fit keeping my mind
alert keeping my landlord appeased
Thats a full-time job

NINOTCHKA
And what do you do for mankind
LEON
For mankind not a thing -- for

womankind the record is not quite so
bleak

NINOTCHKA
You are something we do not have in
Russia

LEON
Thank you Thank you

NINOTCHKA
That is why I believe in the future
of my country

LEON
I begin to believe in it myself since
Ive met you I still dont know
what to make of it It confuses me
it frightens me a little but it
fascinates me Ninotchka

NINOTCHKA
You pronounce it incorrectly Ni-
notchka

LEON
Ni-notchka

NINOTCHKA
That is correct

LEON
Ninotchka do you like me just a
little bit

NINOTCHKA
Your general appearance is not
distasteful

LEON
Thank you

NINOTCHKA
Look at me The whites of your eyes
are clear Your cornea is excellent

LEON
Your cornea is terrific Tell me --
youre so expert on things -- can it
be that Im falling in love with
you

NINOTCHKA
You are bringing in wrong values
Love is a romantic designation for a
most ordinary biological or shall
we say chemical process A lot of
nonsense is talked and written about
it

LEON
Oh I see What do you use instead

NINOTCHKA
I acknowledge the existence of a
natural impulse common to all

LEON
What can I possibly do to encourage
such an impulse in you

NINOTCHKA
You dont have to do a thing
Chemically we are already quite
sympathetic

LEON

(bewildered and yet
completely intrigued)

Youre the most improbable creature
Ive ever met in my life Ninotchka
Ninotchka

NINOTCHKA
You repeat yourself

LEON
Id like to say it a thousand times

NINOTCHKA
Dont do it please

LEON
Im at a loss Ninotchka You must
forgive me if I appear a little old-
fashioned After all Im just a
poor bourgeois

NINOTCHKA
Its never too late to change I
used to belong to the petty
bourgeoisie myself My father and
mother wanted me to stay and work on
the farm but I preferred the bayonet

LEON
(bewildered)
The bayonet Did you really

NINOTCHKA
I was wounded before Warsaw

LEON
Wounded How

NINOTCHKA
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry
Brigade Would you like to see my
wound

LEON
(dumfounded)
Id love to
(she pulls the blouse
off her shoulder and
shows him her scar)
Tsk tsk tsk

NINOTCHKA
A Polish lancer I was sixteen

LEON
Poor Ninotchka Poor poor Ninotchka

NINOTCHKA
(readjusting her blouse)
Dont pity me Pity the Polish lancer
After all Im alive

More and more puzzled and fascinated Leon sits down
close
to her

LEON
What kind of a girl are you anyway

NINOTCHKA
Just what you see A tiny cog in the
great wheel of evolution

LEON
Youre the most adorable cog I ever
saw in my life Ninotchka Cogitska
let me confess something Never did
I dream I could feel like this toward
a sergeant

A clock strikes

LEON
Do you hear that

NINOTCHKA
Its twelve oclock

LEON
Its midnight One half of Paris is
making love to the other half Look
at the clock One hand has met the
other hand They kiss Isnt that
wonderful

NINOTCHKA
Thats the way a clock works Theres
nothing wonderful about it You merely
feel you must put yourself in a
romantic mood to add to your
exhilaration

LEON
I cant possibly think of a better
reason

NINOTCHKA
Its false sentimentality

LEON

(trying desperately

to make her mood

more romantic)
You analyze everything out of
existence You analyze me out of
existence I wont let you Love is
not so simple Ninotchka Ninotchka
why do doves bill and coo Why do
snails coldest of all creatures
circle interminably around each other
Why do moths fly hundreds of miles
to find their mates Why do flowers
open their petals Oh Ninotchka
Ninotchka surely you feel some slight

symptom of the divine passion a
general warmth in the palms of your
hands a strange heaviness in your

limbs a burning of the lips that
is not thirst but a thousand times
more tantalizing more exalting
than thirst

He pauses waiting for the results of his speech

NINOTCHKA
You are very talkative

That is too much for Leon He takes her into his arms
and
kisses her

LEON
Was that talkative

NINOTCHKA
No that was restful Again

Leon kisses her again

NINOTCHKA
Thank you

LEON
Oh my barbaric Ninotchka My
impossible unromantic statistical

All right fight me fight me as

sweeter than sharing a secret with a
bitter enemy

NINOTCHKA

As a representative of Moscow

LEON
Tonight lets not represent anybody

NINOTCHKA
It is out of the question If you
wish to approach me

LEON
You know I want to

NINOTCHKA
Then do it through my lawyer
LEON

Ninotchka you cant walk out like

Gaston disappears into the bath-dressing room Swana
makes
Leon sit down and seats herself beside him

SWANA

eyes Well put in a great nugget of
butter plenty of pepper and salt

SWANA

miserable blouse as though it were
the latest model by Schiaparelli
What a woman What a woman There is
a Russian snowstorm in each of her
eyes

SWANA
You saw all that in one glimpse

BULJANOFF
Once in Petersburg I was driving
down the Nevsky Prospect in my cart
and Her Highness in her troika swept
down from the opposite direction
and when I couldnt make way quick
enough she spat in my face

IRANOFF

Now look here Buljanoff You never
were in Petersburg you never owned

IRANOFF
She says she wont be intimidated by
parasites She called the Duchess a
blood-sucking aristocrat anda
blackmailer

LEON
(eagerly)
What did she say about me

IRANOFF
(after a moments
consideration)
I think she covered you with the
parasites

Leon is disappointed

BULJANOFF
And Leonitchka What she said about
us

IRANOFF
And they might believe her in Moscow
BULJANOFF
What do you mean they might -- they
will

KOPALSKI
We dont blame you Leon but when
we came from Russia we believed in

simplicity

IRANOFF
We avoided luxury and extravagance
and today well if you were to

offer us a glass of champagne we
wouldnt say no

Leon is so engrossed in his thoughts that he overlooks
the
hint

LEON
Well boys Id like to help you but
what can I do Yesterday I waited
six hours in the lobby

KOPALSKI
She doesnt leave her room She has
been locked in for the last two days
with lawyers and law books

LEON
All right then make an appointment
with her so I can see her

KOPALSKI
We cant but you are so ingenious
Leon

IRANOFF

You found your way to us and we
werent easy to reach were we

Oh yes yes

KOPALSKI

BULJANOFF
Or it might be the firing squad

KOPALSKI
Or we cant go back to Russia

An idea dawns on Iranoff

IRANOFF
Whats wrong with that

Kopalski and Buljanoff seize on the same idea

BULJANOFF
Yes We could stay with Leon

IRANOFF
Leon how would you like to have
three lifelong friends

LEON
Boys boys dont forget Russia is

NINOTCHKA

of a machine)
You are referring to paragraph 59b

The Lawyers exchange a glance of surprise at her
knowledge

One of them takes up one of the law books and as he
starts

It is a pleasantly simple place crowded with workmen

He hands her a slate on which the menu is written

PERE MATHIEU

your appetite

Suddenly Ninotchka stares in the direction of the door
MEDIUM SHOT -- AT THE DOOR
Leon has just entered The CAMERA follows him as he

PERE MATHIEU

madame Ill bring you a nice little
lunch a la Pére Mathieu

Leon leans toward Ninotchka with mock humility

LEON

Pardon me for addressing you but you
insulted him you know that You
hurt his feelings It was just like
telling a musician you dont like
music That good old man believes in
food as you believe in Karl Marx
You cant go around hurting people
Comrade Yakushova but maybe you can
make it up to him Do you know how

He exits out of shot

Ninotchka her suspicion confirmed looks at Leon

LEON

NINOTCHKA

LEON
Must one always be after something

NINOTCHKA
Your tactics are useless My name is

Kopalski

LEON
Oh Ninotchka who wants to talk

If we win the suit better You do
me an injustice

(He moves over to her

table leaving the

soup at his table)
When we went to my apartment did I
have the slightest idea that you had
any connection with this deal

NINOTCHKA
But you have now and I know now
that you are a man who employs
business methods which in Russia
would be punished by death

LEON
Death Death Always so glum What

in which we are living The only
moment we really have Dont take it

LEON

Will you smile

NINOTCHKA
Why

LEON
Just smile

NINOTCHKA

LEON

At anything At the whole ludicrous
spectacle of life At people being
pompous and taking themselves
seriously and exaggerating their own
importance If you cant find anything
else to laugh at you can laugh at

you and me
NINOTCHKA
Why

LEON
Because we are an odd couple

NINOTCHKA
Then you should go back to your table

LEON
No I cant leave you I wont Not
yet Not until Ive made you laugh
at least once

To get rid of him Ninotchka emits a joyless sound which
approximates a laugh

NINOTCHKA
Ha Ha Now go back

LEON
Thats not a laugh I mean a laugh
from the heart Now lets see Im
going to tell you a funny story
Just a moment Ive got it Well
it seems there were a couple of
Frenchmen who went to America

NINOTCHKA
On which boat

LEON
(thrown off by her
methodical thinking)
Well er lets drop it I dont
think you would care for that one

NINOTCHKA
Probably not

LEON
Do you like Scotch stories

NINOTCHKA
I have never heard one

LEON
Two Scotchmen met on the street
and I dont know the name of the
street and it really doesnt matter
Well anyway ones name was McIntosh
and the others was McGillicuddy
McIntosh says to McGillicuddy Hello
Mr McGillicuddy and McGillicuddy
says to McIntosh Hello Mr
McIntosh and then McIntosh says to
McGillicuddy How is Mrs
McGillicuddy and then McGillicuddy
says to McIntosh How is Mrs
McIntosh

NINOTCHKA
I wish they had never met

LEON
(disarmed)
So do I
(after a little pause)
Now heres a great one Ha Ha
Ha

(he looks at Ninotchka

and her expression

stops him)
Well maybe its not so good Lets
forget it Hows this Two men are
looking at the moon One says to the
other Is it true that a lot of
people live on the moon Yes it
is says the other five hundred
million Whew replies the first
they must get pretty crowded when
its half moon Ha Ha Ha

There is no response from Ninotchka

LEON
(starting to get sore)
I suppose you dont think thats
funny

NINOTCHKA
No

LEON
It seemed funny to me when I first
heard it Maybe the trouble isnt
with the joke Maybe its with you

NINOTCHKA
I dont think so

LEON
Maybe you havent any sense of humor
Well Ill give you one more chance
Now listen

He gets up and speaks in a threatening voice audible to
the
entire room

LEON
When I heard this joke for the first
time I laughed myself sick Here
goes A man comes into a restaurant
and sits down and says Waiter Get
me a cup of coffee without cream
After five minutes the waiter comes
back and says Im sorry sir were
all out of cream can it be without
milk

GROUP OF SEVERAL WORKMEN

They have overheard the story and all burst into
laughter

NINOTCHKA AND LEON
Ninotchka continues to eat her soup without a shadow of
laugh

LEON
(furious)
Not funny huh

NINOTCHKA
No

LEON
So you dont think thats funny It
is funny Everyone else thinks so
Maybe you didnt get it

He sits down again

LEON
(threateningly)
Ill tell you that joke again A man
comes into a restaurant Did you get
that

NINOTCHKA
Yes

LEON
He sits down at the table and says

to the waiter Did you get that
too

NINOTCHKA
Yes

LEON

Well so far it isnt funny but
wait He says to the waiter Waiter
Bring me a cup of coffee So the
waiter comes back five minutes later
and says Im sorry sir we have
no coffee

(he realizes he has

made a mistake)
Wait a minute wait a minute
Im all mixed up

(he starts over again)
A man comes in a restaurant he sits
down he calls the waiter and he
says Waiter Get me a cup of coffee
without cream and five minutes
later the waiter comes back and says
Im sorry sir we have no cream
can it be a glass of milk

He gets up and goes over to his table furiously

LEON
Ah You have no sense of humor That
settles it You have no sense of
humor None No humor

In his excitement he leans on the shaky table It
topples

forward Simultaneously his feet shoot from under him
and he

sits violently on the floor the contents of the table

crashing about him hot soup in his face

A terrific roar of laughter arises the whole
restaurant is
rocking with laughter

For a split second Ninotchka makes an effort to control
the

irresistible impulse to laugh but loses the battle and
herself

roars with laughter

FADE IN

A conference is in session -- Ninotchka her two

and the Three Russians Ninotchka sits at the desk
back in the chair looking into space and apparently
every point which is brought up One of the lawyers is
from a document

LAWYER

(reading)
In addition to the arguments above
enumerated for lifting this
injunction we wish to cite the
decision of the High Court of Paris
rendered in the case of Princess
Marishka against the Government of
Montenegro on the fifth day of August
1897 Comparing the facts in that
case with our present set of facts
we feel that the Treaty between the
Republic of France and the USSR
should prevail over all

Suddenly Ninotchka laughs Everyone looks at her

Ninotchka gets up

NINOTCHKA
Im sorry gentlemen The other day
I heard such a funny story

(she laughs again)
It still makes me laugh It is very
funny

(a little embarrassed)
I am sorry Oh yes about this
injunction

LAWYER
(very businesslike)
The hearing is set for the twentieth
of this month

NINOTCHKA
(not thinking of the
injunction)
Thats two weeks from Thursday

LAWYER
We did our utmost to have it set
ahead

NINOTCHKA

completely different

from her former

business conferences)
I know gentlemen but it is in the
hands of the Court Were helpless

LAWYER
Yes It is unfortunate

NINOTCHKA
Well theres nothing we can do about
it Why get excited

The Three Russians as well as the Lawyers are puzzled
The Russians exchange hopeful glances

LAWYER
Well leave these papers here for
your further consideration Au revoir

NINOTCHKA
Au revoir

The Lawyers leave
Left alone with the Russians Ninotchka is unable to
conceal
her happiness entirely

NINOTCHKA

plans for this evening madame

NINOTCHKA

(getting more and

more in the spirit

of her change of

appearance)
Well first I should like to take
off my hat and jacket

(Leon takes them)
Then could we have some music

LEON
A wonderful idea Radio or records

NINOTCHKA
Not radio Lets have music thats
just for ourselves

Leon turns on the victrola

LEON
(with great feeling
and sincerity)
Ill play it softly because I have
things to tell you about which I
cant shout

He walks back to Ninotchka who by now is seated in an
armchair He sits on the arm of the chair He tries to

make
a declaration of his love He stammers several words
LEON
Well my darling I we
It is no use In a sudden outburst of emotion he takes
her

in his arms and kisses her

LEON
(as they come out of
the kiss)
You see I couldnt shout that

NINOTCHKA

other

desk
from
she

with

looking

and

glances

Leon you know the jokes you told me
a few days ago I wake up in the
middle of the night and laugh at
them Now Leon thats wrong I know
theyre not funny theyre silly
Theyre stupid And still I
laugh and when I look at Buljanoff
and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they
are scoundrels and I should hate
them -- then I realize who made them
like that and instead of sending my
report to Moscow I tear it up and go

down and buy a ridiculous hat and
if this keeps on am I too
talkative
LEON
(radiantly)
No go on
NINOTCHKA

Leon I want to tell you something

which I thought I never would say

which I thought nobody ever should

say because I thought it didnt

exist and Leon I cant say

it
They kiss again As the kiss ends they look at each
for a second
Ninotchka gets up and goes toward the desk sits in the
chair opens her handbag which lies there and takes
it a little mirror and a lipstick Before she uses it
looks at Leon with guilty happiness Leon looks at her
great tenderness and walks over to the desk and stands

at her as she makes up her lips

LEON
What a gesture for a sergeant

As soon as she is finished Ninotchka slips the mirror
lipstick back into her handbag and as she does so

at the top of the desk
NINOTCHKA
Leon I would like to ask you
something

LEON
Anything Ninotchka

NINOTCHKA
If you dont want to answer you
neednt But if you do you must
tell me the truth

LEON
I promise I swear
NINOTCHKA

(seriously)

Did you make any change in this room

LEON
I dont think so

NINOTCHKA
When I was here before I noticed a
photograph of a woman on the desk in
a wide silver frame I thought what
a waste of silver Thats all that
interested me then Now I would like
to know what happened to the woman

Leon too is completely serious by now For answer he

quietly
opens the drawer of the desk Ninotchka looks in and
takes
from the drawer the photograph As she looks at it she
rises
NINOTCHKA
The Duchess
Leon nods gravely
NINOTCHKA

(looking at the picture)
She is very attractive She has great
elegance

(she looks back at

Leon)
Shes what you call a woman of the
world isnt she

world

LEON
(after a little pause)
Ninotchka I love you

NINOTCHKA
I suppose she is very entertaining
It must be lots of fun to be with
her so witty so glamorous

LEON
Ninotchka youre jealous

Ninotchka nods sadly
NINOTCHKA

(with great feeling)
Leon dont ever ask me for a picture

of myself I couldnt bear the
thought of being shut up ina
drawer I couldnt breathe I

couldnt stand it

LEON
My darling

As he takes her in his arms we

radiant in a beautiful evening gown
SWANAS TABLE
Swanas expression freezes as she sees Ninotchka The
of the guests stare in an embarrassed silence save for
bird-brained little guest named Marianne who feels it
mission to save the situation

MARIANNE

A neighbor nudges her warningly Swana withers her with

glance and rises

CLOSE SHOT -- LEONS TABLE

Leon and Ninotchka are seated and a Waiter stands by
them

presenting a bottle of champagne to Leon for his
approval

LEON
(to Waiter)
Is it dry

WAITER
Yes monsieur

LEON
(to Ninotchka)
s that right or do you prefer it
sweet

NINOTCHKA
wouldnt know The closest I ever
came to champagne was in a newsreel
The wife of some president was
throwing it at a battleship

LEON
ts always good luck to launch
something with champagne a
battleship or an evening

By now the Waiter is filling their glasses Ninotchka

lifts
her glass and looks at it
NINOTCHKA
Its funny to look back I was brought
up on goats milk I had a ration of
vodka in the army and now champagne
LEON
(gaily)
From goats to grapes Thats drinking
in the right direction
Ninotchka takes her first sip of champagne Leon drinks
and
watches her The first sip proves a painful surprise
Ninotchkas face is that of a child who has been fed a
bad
medicine
NINOTCHKA
Ugh um oh
(slowly the delight
of champagne dawns
on her and her face
breaks into a smile)
Its good
She drinks the whole glass at once Leon looks at her
in
amused surprise He drinks too The Waiter fills their
glasses

again

NINOTCHKA
From what I read I thought champagne
was a strong drink Its very
delicate Do people ever get drunk
on this

LEON

There have been cases but the
headache the next morning is worth
while -- if you drink it with the
right toast

(he raises his glass

again fondly)
To us Ninotchka

They clink glasses and drink again looking at each
other
floor

and

stops

General Savitzky start to dance by the table Swana
pretending complete astonishment

SWANA

LEON
(embarrassed)

SWANA
(to Leon)

(to General Savitzky)

GENERAL SAVITZKY

embarrassed nevertheless

introduction)

Swana sits down

SWANA
(to General Savitzky)
General would you mind making my
excuses at our table Ill be back

GENERAL SAVITZKY
Certainly
He bows and leaves
CLOSE SHOT -- ALL THREE SITTING AT THE TABLE

SWANA
Well Leon we can be proud of our
Punchy He had a triumph at the dog
show

During the following speech Ninotchkas expression
does not
change She knows exactly the game Swana is playing

SWANA

(continuing)
He won another blue ribbon and bit
the judge Ha ha ha I bought him
the cutest sweater as a reward You
should see him strut down the street
in it He looks like a little
boulevardier

(to Ninotchka)
You see Count dAlgout gave me Punchy
for my birthday

(to Leon)
You must have searched weeks before
you found anything as divine as
Punchy didnt you Leon

LEON
(fed up with Swanas
tactics)
Months Swana

SWANA
(to Ninotchka)
Poor Madame Yakushova here we are
talking in mysteries Im sure

you wonder what its all about

NINOTCHKA
(dry and direct)
Not at all I understand perfectly

Count dAlgout gave you a dog You
made it very clear madame

SWANA
Dear me I must be losing my
finesse If Im not careful Ill be
understood by everybody
LEON
(acutely uncomfortable)
Theres a charming crowd here tonight
isnt there

SWANA

Im going Leon

(she rises as does

Leon delighted to

get rid of her)
but before I leave I must compliment
you on your gown Madame Yakushova
Is that what theyre wearing in Moscow
this year

NINOTCHKA
No last year madame

Swana sits again as does Leon

SWANA

Isnt it amazing One gets a wrong
impression of the new Russia

(cynically)
It must be charming Im glad
conditions are so improved I assume
this is what the factory workers
wear at their dances

NINOTCHKA
Exactly You see it would have been
embarrassing for people of my sort
to wear low-cut gowns in the old
Russia The lashes of the Cossacks
across our backs were not very
becoming and you know how vain women
are

SWANA
Youre absolutely right about the
Cossacks We made an unpardonable
mistake when we let them use their
knouts They had such reliable guns

Leon has grown more and more uncomfortable as the two
ladies
fence

LEON
Will you do me a favor Stop talking
about the good old days
SWANA

A very wise suggestion Leon Im
afraid madame and I will never agree

(she plays her trump

card)
The only thing we have in common is
our lawsuit and that will be decided
next week I understand everything
will be over by Thursday Am I right

Ninotchka and Leon realize the malice and yet the truth

of
her words
NINOTCHKA
Youre right madame it will all be
over by Thursday
SWANA
(rubbing it in)
It is unfortunate that you have so
few more days in Paris
(she turns to Leon)
Be sure and redouble your efforts so
that madame can take some pleasant
memories when she returns to Moscow
(she rises Leon rising
too)
Good night
(Ninotchka nods without
answering To Leon)
Good night Leon
LEON
(coldly)
Good night Swana
Swana leaves the table Leon sits again The mood of
the two
has been changed by the problem of their separation
which

has been brought before them They sit in silence for a
moment Ninotchka speaks first

NINOTCHKA
Now I think I need a glass of
champagne

Leon fills their glasses They drink Then Leon takes
Ninotchkas hand
He stops

NINOTCHKA
(trying to break the
mood)
Quickly please tell me one of
your funny stories

LEON
A funny story

NINOTCHKA
You never finished the one about the
two Scotchmen with the names

LEON
Well there were two Scotchmen One
was named McIntosh and one was named
McGillicuddy They met on the street

NINOTCHKA
Go on

LEON

No darling Ill tell you another
story a much better one

(with deep sincerity)
The only thing that will be over on
Thursday is the lawsuit There will
be no Thursday for us Not next week
or any week We wont let it happen
Ill tear it out of the calendar Is
that a good story

NINOTCHKA
(touched)
Wonderful -- if one could believe
it
LEON

You must darling

NINOTCHKA
(lifting her glass)
To the loveliest story I ever heard

They drink The orchestra starts a number

NINOTCHKA
(afraid of where the
conversation may
lead)
Shall we dance
They both start toward the dance floor
CLOSE SHOT -- LEON AND NINOTCHKA DANCING A WALTZ

At the second turn Ninotchka starts to feel the effect

of
the champagne
NINOTCHKA
(tipsily)

Oo Darling Something is the matter
LEON

to grapes a little too fast
NINOTCHKA

Oh everything is so wonderful Its

getting farther and farther away
LEON

NINOTCHKA

In the gayest mood Ninotchka addresses the crowd on
the

dance floor

NINOTCHKA
Comrades Comrades

LEON
(embarrassed)
Darling darling please
NINOTCHKA

I must talk to my brothers

LEON
Shhh Shhh

NINOTCHKA
Dont shush me I am People I want
to make a speech I want to overthrow
the Duchess
Leon starts to lead her off the dance floor

LEON
But darling you cant do that

NINOTCHKA
Comrades Good people of France

LEON
Now Ninotchka please
NINOTCHKA
They are all Duchesses here
thousands of Duchesses and I am

LEON
Quite right yes yes yes but

The bartender gives Leon his double brandy and Leon

it off The Manager comes into the shot and addresses

MANAGER
(very excitedly)
Im very sorry Count dAlgout it
is most embarrassing but the lady
you brought with you tonight is
spreading communistic propaganda in
the powder room

Leon stares at him for a second then turns to the

LEON
Give me another double brandy

MANAGER
That kind of propaganda is bad
anywhere but inciting the attendants
of a powder room to go on strike
Well if she succeeds the consequences
will be disastrous

LEON
What can I do about it

MANAGER
She has been asked to leave the powder
room but without success We would
appreciate if you would see to it
yourself

LEON
(horrified)
You want me to go in there

MANAGER
Im sorry sir but I must insist

The Manager bows and walks away Leon gulps down the

second

double brandy The CAMERA follows him as he proceeds
toward

the powder room like a hero going into battle Just as
he is

about to enter a very dignified elderly lady comes
out is

surprised at his attempted entrance and glares at him

the bar to strengthen it with some of the Dutch
variety

(also disappointed)
No no music

Through her fog Ninotchka becomes aware of the case
containing the jewels

NINOTCHKA
(bitterly)
There it is Thursday you cant
rip it out of the week

LEON
(helpfully)
But I can throw it out of the window

NINOTCHKA
(philosophically)
It wouldnt be fair to the man in
the street
(she pushes back the
lid)
There they are they are terrible
things those jewels

LEON
but big

NINOTCHKA
they are the tears of Old Russia
see that stone

LEON
Who cried that one

NINOTCHKA
Czar Peter gave it to his wife
Catherine the Great For it he sold
ten thousand serfs in the market

LEON
Now darling dont get impatient
wait until we are married You know
that worthless butler of mine
that reactionary Some day when I
come home to you I may say Darling
I drove Gaston to the market and
look what I got from him

From the case of jewels he takes a beautiful diadem and
holds

it in front of her

NINOTCHKA
(the economist now)
First ten thousand serfs now just
Gaston It is very encouraging

Leon takes her by the hand and leads her from the safe

LEON
Come sweetheart Let me put it on
you You will teach these jewels
For the first time they will learn
how they can look

NINOTCHKA
They belong to the people

LEON
(in a ceremonial voice)
I give them back to the people
(as formal and steady
as possible under
the conditions he
puts the diadem on

her head)
I make you Ninotchka the Great
Duchess of the People Grand

Duchess of the People

Ninotchka falls in with the spirit of this imaginary
coronation

Good morning

SWANA
It is tomorrow morning tomorrow
noon to be exact I hope you will
forgive me I know its extremely
cruel to waken anyone at such an
hour Dont you recognize me I am
the Duchess Swana

By now Ninotchka is awake She gets up and realizes to
her

acute embarrassment the condition in which Swana has
found

her

SWANA
I know how you feel my dear The
morning after always does look grim
if you happen to be wearing last
nights dress Dont be embarrassed
by my presence though You couldnt
have found anybody more sympathetic
to your condition I remember once
in Petrograd when I felt exactly as
you do I had to bow from a balcony
to the crowd My dear the masses
have no understanding of the feelings
of a lady before noon Dont you
find that true

During Swanas speech Ninotchka has found herself
completely

NINOTCHKA
I think we can cut your visit short
Leon is not here

SWANA

Of course not my dear I didnt
come here with any such suspicion
How ridiculous

(with a glance toward

the living room)
Nor did I come here to pick up his
hat

SWANA
(as she reaches the
threshold)
How stale last nights gaiety looks
It has the taste of a dead cigarette

NINOTCHKA
If you were encouraged to come here
by our meeting last night I am afraid
you misunderstood my attitude

SWANA

Dont worry you were quite rude
enough

(during the following

speech she draws

the curtains and

opens the windows)
Do you mind if I let in a little
fresh air and sunshine Im sure it
will make you feel better and I want
you to be at your very best In full
possession of your faculties at
least

NINOTCHKA
(regaining her usual
firmness)
Please come to the point What is it
you want

SWANA
I just dropped in to have a little
heart-to-heart talk with you

NINOTCHKA
We have nothing to discuss

SWANA
Now there you are completely wrong
If we sit down for a little chat
Im sure we wont run out of
conversation and whats more it wont
be dull

NINOTCHKA
Madame what is it you people always
say regardless of what you mean
T am delighted to have you here I
have not reached that stage of
civilization

SWANA
Thats all right I grow on people
NINOTCHKA

must ask you to leave

SWANA

Leave Thats exactly what I came
here to ask you to do Leave I dont
mean this hotel and I dont mean
Paris I mean France Theres a
plane for Moscow at five-forty

NINOTCHKA
(puzzled)
Madame if you

SWANA
Dont worry I have already made
reservations Its perfect flying
weather They assure me theres a
fine tail wind which will sweep you
back to Moscow in no time

NINOTCHKA
(still not
understanding)
If this is meant to be a joke it is
not funny Or do you still think
youre issuing orders from your palace
in Petrograd

Ninotchkas words for the first time sting Swana out of
her
apparently superficial attitude

SWANA

(bitterly)
My palace in Petrograd yes you
took that away from me You took
away my czar my country my people
everything I had

(with emphasis)
but nothing more -- I warn you

NINOTCHKA
(simply)
People cannot be taken away madame
neither a hundred and sixty million
nor one Not if you have their love
remember

You hadnt Thats why youre not in
Russia any longer and thats why
you came here this morning

SWANA
Very interesting my dear but
couldnt you write all that from
Moscow A dissertation on love on
Soviet stationery -- would be an
amusing paradox

NINOTCHKA

It is not enough to be witty madame

People grow tired of being
entertained You made that mistake
before Problems were never solved
by bowing from a balcony

SWANA

My dear you dont know how impressive

I could be Did you ever see me in
my regalia with my diadem and all my
jewels

The word diadem startles Ninotchka She starts to
the night before and she looks toward the safe

Ninotchka stares in the direction of the safe as Swana

SWANA
You cant deny we gave the people
their moneys worth -- almost --
eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight
NINOTCHKA
(desperately)

I must insist that you leave

SWANA
Not before you agree to use those
reservations to Moscow

NINOTCHKA
In that case I can only say good-by

NINOTCHKA

Believe me Leon cant help you He

NINOTCHKA
Where are they

SWANA
You were very careless with our
precious jewels my dear Theyre
too expensive a toy for two children
to play with

NINOTCHKA
Where are they

SWANA

Dont worry Fortunately last night
a very trustworthy friend kept his
eyes open Perhaps he overstepped
his function as a waiter but he
fulfilled his duty as a Russian

(she draws back the

fur scarf she is

wearing revealing a

diamond star one of

the jewels we have

seen)
I just put this on for sentiment
The rest are absolutely safe I assure
you But if you feel like notifying
the police

NINOTCHKA
You leave me no choice

SWANA
Wont it be rather embarrassing for
a Soviet Envoy to disclose the
circumstances under which she lost
them

NINOTCHKA
I will have to face the consequences
but so will you Dont forget they
will ask how you got them

SWANA
Thats very simple to answer They
were given to me by my mother They
were given to her by her mother in
fact theyre mine you cannot steal
what belongs to you

She proceeds into the living room followed by

Ninotchka

They both

NINOTCHKA
They always belonged to the Russian
people They were paid for with their
sweat their blood their lives and
you will give them back

SWANA
(triumphantly)
I told you we had plenty to talk
about Shall we sit down

sit

SWANA

(very matter-of-fact)
Now lets free ourselves from
emotionalism and try to solve the
problem in a practical way Our
situation has changed considerably
Before I had only a claim to the
jewels Now I have the jewels

NINOTCHKA
In other words moral ideas have no
weight with you all right then
lets deal with legal facts You
know that France has recognized the
Soviet

SWANA
Unfortunately

NINOTCHKA
Under Soviet law the jewels belong
to the State France is going to
uphold that ownership

SWANA
My lawyer agrees with you He says
France will uphold it in every court
but I will drag you through every
court dont forget that And when I
say it will take two years I am as
always conservative

NINOTCHKA
Wont those two years in court be
expensive for you I know that money
was no object as long as you could
squeeze it from the pockets of the
people but now

SWANA
I may run out of money but you have
already run out of bread Two years
is a long time for your comrades to
wait

NINOTCHKA
I see You have calculated in terms
of hunger

SWANA
No I just wanted to be absolutely
impartial Both of us are faced with
two rather uncomfortable years We
can condense these two years to two
minutes if you want to accept my
proposition Ninotchka now realizes
what she is after

NINOTCHKA
Go on

SWANA
I am willing to hand over the jewels
and sign the necessary papers if you
take that five-forty plane to Moscow

NINOTCHKA
(quietly)
Thats not the way to win him back
not Leon
SWANA

I think I know Leon quite as well as
you possibly a little better
Leave that worry to me Five-forty
leaves you time enough to close the
deal with Monsieur Mercier but
naturally youll be too busy for any
farewells Ill see to it that
everything is done in the most
expeditious manner and I will also
see you to the airport Thats my
proposition Comrade Yakushova

SWANA
Leon darling how nice Have you
ordered tea or a cocktail

LEON
No thanks Swana

SWANA
Did I act stupidly last night Should
I apologize

LEON
Im the one who should apologize I
should have talked to you before

SWANA
Is this by any chance going to be
a confession

LEON
Yes

SWANA
Oh no my little Volga boatman
Have you forgotten our First
Commandment Never Complain -- Never
Explain It has worked so often and
so perfectly dont lets break the
rule And please dont look so guilty
otherwise Ill

LEON
This time Swana -- just this once --
I must ask you to listen

SWANA
All right Ill listen

LEON
I know you hate the obvious but do
you mind if at this moment Im not
in the least subtle

SWANA
Brutal frankness if you insist

LEON
There are a hundred ways to approach
it but I feel it can best be said
in one simple phrase Im in love
Swana

SWANA
And I thought it was something
serious How could you frighten me
so

LEON
It must be serious Swana Not long
ago Id have considered such a
statement rather juvenile and rather
middle class Now I can say it without
stammering without a blush Im in
love Swana

SWANA
Say it over and over again Leon
Words are a wonderful safety valve
and thats what you need -- because
you know its impossible dont you

LEON
I have to be simple again Swana
and you may find it shockingly banal
Ive thought it over and Im willing
to take all the consequences even
if it means a complete readjustment
of my way of living

SWANA
Leon This has the ugly sound of
regeneration

LEON
Im afraid thats what it is

SWANA

The same old trouble Leon Youre
always late Whether youre taking
me to the Opera or calling for me at
a beauty shop youre never on time
And now when its a question of
your reform -- late again

wrist watch)

SWANA
Knowing the efficiency of the French

that Madame Yakushova has already

Hello Leon darling

LEON

SWANA
(suavely) After our talk last night

assistance to you

His words are unmistakably a final dismissal She walks
out

It is a comparatively small room which she shares with
other girls As she enters only one girl is present It

Out of her cupboard she takes very primitive-looking

a flower pot glasses and a kind of shawl which serves

NINOTCHKA
Didnt you march

Anna is apparently not a fanatical believer in the

regime and takes a cynical and humorous attitude toward

ANNA
They didnt let me I am in disgrace
Last week at the performance of Carmen
I played a sour note The conductor
got so excited he yelled Theres
sabotage in the string section

NINOTCHKA
Too bad you missed an inspiring
day Anna

ANNA
I know my heart is sad but my

feet are happy When all the tanks
and guns were roaring over the Red
Square I sat here all by myself and
played a Beethoven sonata Not bad
at all

(she has noticed

Are you expecting someone

NINOTCHKA
Well Ive saved up two eggs and
each of my friends is bringing his
own so well manage

ANNA
It just goes to prove the theory of
our State If you stand alone it
means a boiled egg but if youre
true to the collective spirit and
stick together youve got an omelet

(devilishly)
That reminds me have you heard
the latest theyre telling about the
Kremlin

expression walks quietly through the room to another

taking in the girls with one sly glance and giving the
impression that not only his eyes but his ears are

ANNA

disappeared into the

other room she

continues)

hes on his way to the washroom or
the Secret Police

NINOTCHKA
You should be more careful Anna

ANNA
And you too Ninotchka
NINOTCHKA
(amazed)
About what

ANNA
Ever since you have been back from
Paris

NINOTCHKA

I havent talked to anyone about
Paris I havent said a word

ANNA
Thats just it It makes people feel
queer I dont want you to get in
any trouble

NINOTCHKA
I have nothing to hide

ANNA
You should Ill show you

She walks over to her cupboard and takes out a piece of
lingerie and comes back to Ninotchka with it

ANNA
When I passed through the laundry
yard today I saw all the women huddled
around this so I brought it up here
Things like this create a bad feeling
First they didnt know whose it was
Then they saw the Paris label and
did it start a commotion Some said
its what we all ought to wear and
others said its like hanging foreign
ideas on our clothesline It
undermines our whole cause

NINOTCHKA
(aware of the pettiness
which surrounds her)
I see

You know how it is today all you
have to do is wear a pair of silk
stockings and they suspect you of

Thank you Anna Ill dry it up here

to see our country endangered by my
underwear

Ninotchka you know I am your friend
you can trust me Did you bring

back anything else

suddenly is transported to Paris in her

NINOTCHKA
(with feeling)
No I left everything in Paris I
just happened to be wearing this

ANNA
Tell me what else did you have

NINOTCHKA
(enjoying the thought)
Well a hat

ANNA
What was it like

NINOTCHKA
It was very silly I would be
ashamed to wear it here

ANNA
As beautiful as that What else
Come tell me

NINOTCHKA
An evening gown

ANNA
(puzzled)
Evening gown

NINOTCHKA
A dress you wear in the evening

ANNA
What do you wear in the morning

NINOTCHKA
When you get up you put on a negligee
and then you change to a morning
frock

ANNA
You mean to tell me you wear a
different dress for different times
of the day

NINOTCHKA
Yes

ANNA
Now Ninotchka youre exaggerating

NINOTCHKA
No my dear it is true Thats how
they live in the other world Here
we dress to have our bodies covered
to keep warm

ANNA
And there

NINOTCHKA
Well sometimes theyre not completely
covered but they dont freeze

ANNA
(fingering the piece
of lingerie)
They must have wonderful materials
to make a thing like this so soft
something you dont even see

NINOTCHKA
You feel it though

ANNA
(hesitantly)
Ninotchka I wouldnt bring this up
if we werent such good friends

NINOTCHKA
What is it Anna

ANNA
You know I told you that Pavlov and
I are going to get married when he
comes back from the maneuvers Would
it be asking too much

NINOTCHKA
You want this

ANNA
Just for the honeymoon

NINOTCHKA
You can have it for good It is my
wedding present

Anna is for a moment speechless over this generous
gift She
embraces and kisses Ninotchka

ANNA
Ninotchka Ninotchka

She kisses her again takes her cello and starts to
leave

ANNA
Am I going to play that cadenza
tonight

Anna exits closing the door Ninotchka is left alone
Her

thoughts are still in the other world obviously with
Leon

Mechanically she looks over the table to see if
everything

is all right then she walks over to the radio (a

little machine) As she turns the knob she smiles again

population owned three hundred forty-three million four
hundred and sixty-nine thousand acres of land sixty-

per cent of the total area And one hundred and fifty
nobles possessed thirty-five per cent of the countrys
wealth

Ninotchka turns off the radio She closes her eyes for
moment and with a sad smile murmurs to herself

NINOTCHKA
No music

At this moment the door opens and Buljanoff Iranoff
Kopalski enter There follow warm greetings between
and the Three Russians

ALL THREE RUSSIANS
Ninotchka Ninotchka

A moment of silence follows The four look at each
people do who share a secret
NINOTCHKA
(with great warmth)

How are you you three scoundrels

KOPALSKI
(wryly)
Well were back home

BULJANOFF
(sourly)
You know what they say -- theres
nothing like home

IRANOFF
Thats right and we might as well
face it

NINOTCHKA

(trying not to say
what she feels)
Come now you must not talk that

way You have to adjust

yourselves We must be brave
IRANOFF

Brave thats right
BULJANOFF

Lets be happy that were all alive

IRANOFF
And thats something we owe to
Ninotchka

KOPALSKI
If you hadnt given Commissar Razinin
such a wonderful report about us
who knows what would have happened

BULJANOFF
I can tell you exactly

NINOTCHKA
Now lets forget everything except
that were together

BULJANOFF
Thats right

IRANOFF
Lets do that

KOPALSKI
(falling in with her
attempt)
Its a real Paris reunion
IRANOFF
If you close your eyes and listen to
our voices we might be in Paris

NINOTCHKA
Lets not close our eyes There are
many good things to see here too

BULJANOFF
(cynically)
I think I need my glasses

KOPALSKI
(reprimanding him
quietly)
A little more tact look how nicely
shes fixed the table -- all for us
BULJANOFF

(in a loud voice

trying to make up

for his faux pas)
How nicely youve fixed the table
Ninotchka

IRANOFF
What a lovely room you have here

BULJANOFF
How many families live here with
you

NINOTCHKA
Only myself and two other girls One
is a cello player in the opera and
the other a street-car conductor

IRANOFF
(impressed)
Just three people in a room this
size Whew

KOPALSKI
(inspecting the room)
And your own gas cooker Thats
marvelous
(forgetting himself)
Naturally its not the Royal Suite

NINOTCHKA
Sssh Once and for all were in
Moscow
KOPALSKI
(walking over to the

window)
Yes theres no doubt of that
(sarcastically)
Just look out of the window and there
it is

NINOTCHKA
And its great Think what it was a
few years ago and what it is now

Iranoff and Buljanoff have joined them at the window

IRANOFF
Shes right
(under his breath)
anyhow lets talk ourselves into it

BULJANOFF
Just see how happy the people look
from here

KOPALSKI
Can you blame them at least the
May Day parade is over

BULJANOFF
Thats another thing its spring

NINOTCHKA
The same spring we had in Paris
Just as good

KOPALSKI
Even the swallows are back

BULJANOFF AND IRANOFF
Yes thats right

IRANOFF
Maybe thats the same swallow we saw
in Paris

BULJANOFF
It is Ninotchka It is He must
have been in Paris You can see it
in his whole attitude He just picked
up a crumb of our black bread shook
his head and dropped it
KOPALSKI
If you asked him why he left France
I bet he couldnt name one good
reason

BULJANOFF
I should be a swallow Right now I
would be sitting in front of the
Café de Paris picking up flakes of
French pastry that would melt in my

bill

NINOTCHKA
Now comrades there is something
better in life than crumbs of French
pastry

KOPALSKI

(the realist)
Yes a good piece of apfel strudel

NINOTCHKA
We will get that well get
everything maybe a little bit
later but well get it We must be
patient Finally we got the spring
didnt we We got the swallows and
you will get your apfel strudel too

BULJANOFF
(consolingly)
And if it is too late for you your
children will eat it

IRANOFF
(breaking the mood)
Lets forget the future lets
stop being sentimental lets start
that omelet
KOPALSKI

Thats right
(he takes a little
box out of his pocket)
Heres my egg
(he hands it to
Ninotchka)

Iranoff unties his egg from his handkerchief

IRANOFF
And heres mine
we

to

were

He hands it to Ninotchka
Buljanoff reaches in his pocket and from his expression

see that a catastrophe must have happened

BULJANOFF

Comrades Im out of the omelet
NINOTCHKA

Dont worry there will be enough
IRANOFF

Come Ninotchka lets make it in
real Parisian style

The group all go to the gas cooker and Ninotchka starts
make the omelet The others stand around as though they

watching a great event

KOPALSKI
Lets fill it with confitures des
prunes

BULJANOFF
des raisins de Madére des
framboises

(with grapes of
Madeira with
raspberries)

IRANOFF
des petites fraises des bois
de la créme de Bretagne
(with small wild
strawberries with
cream)

KOPALSKI
SO it blows up that big what
they call an Omelette Surprise

BULJANOFF
And the surprise is theres nothing
in it

KOPALSKI

these wonderful things at least lets

IRANOFF

Sssh
The conversation stops Gurganov walks quietly through
room again observing everything He goes out at last
IRANOFF
A man like that all he has to do
is to walk through a room and the
omelet drops

There is a dead silence All are again aware of the

which surrounds They concentrate quietly on the frying

Ninotchka is enjoying their companionship After a

squareset unfriendly woman in uniform
At sight of her one of the Russians nudges Ninotchka
the gesture of ringing up a fare and accompanies it
inquiring look Ninotchka nods The Russians change
tune quickly to the Volga Boatman in order not to

The street-car conductor goes to her bed and starts to

Again Gurganov crosses the room this time accompanied

Ninotchka sits in the chair nearest the lamp All three
looking over her shoulder Ninotchka hesitates to open
letter obviously wanting to read it all by herself
her feelings the Three Russians walk to the far end of
room and sit down on a little bench looking toward

opens the letter She starts to read it Suddenly her
expression changes to one of terrific disappointment

turns the letter over glances at the second page then

Iranoff puts the letter back on the table They all

and realize that Ninotchka wants to be alone

KOPALSKI
Well I think its getting late
Good night Ninotchka

IRANOFF
Thank you for a wonderful dinner

Ninotchka rises and shakes their hands

NINOTCHKA
(with great warmth)
Good night my friends

The three start to leave but Buljanoff returns and
whispers
to Ninotchka

BULJANOFF

She walks to

presence

She is a tired stern girl Razinin looks up

RAZININ
Good morning Comrade

NINOTCHKA
(very businesslike)
Good morning Comrade Commissar
Here is my report on the materials
available for trading in the next
four months

RAZININ
Does this include the products of
the Far Eastern provinces

NINOTCHKA
Yes it does

RAZININ
You mean you have finished the whole
investigation

NINOTCHKA
Yes

RAZININ
Thats marvelous You must have
worked day and night Dont you
ever sleep

NINOTCHKA
I need very little sleep We must be
extremely careful what goods we take
in exchange I have already started
a survey of our most urgent needs

RAZININ
Well Comrade I am afraid you will
have to turn over that work to someone
else

NINOTCHKA
(startled)
May I ask why

RAZININ

Please sit down
Ninotchka sits

RAZININ

NINOTCHKA
Thank you

RAZININ

Well Comrade have you heard from
your friends Kopalski Buljanoff
and Iranoff

NINOTCHKA
No

RAZININ
I havent either but Ive heard
about them You must realize it was
only on the strength of your Paris
report that I sent them to
Constantinople without that I never
would have trusted them on a mission
as important as the fur deal

NINOTCHKA
May I ask what has happened

RAZININ
As soon as our representatives go to
a foreign country they seem to lose
all sense of balance If I told you
whats going on in Constantinople
right now you wouldnt believe it
Those three have been sitting there
for six weeks and havent solda
piece of fur

(he points to the

folder)
This anonymous report was sent me
They are dragging the good name of
our country through every café and
night club Here

(he reads from the

report)
How can the Bolshevik cause gain
respect among the Moslems if your
three representatives Buljanoff
Iranoff and Kopalski get so drunk
that they throw a carpet out of their
hotel window and complain to the
management that it didnt fly

Ninotchka has to suppress a smile of amusement at the
antics
of her three old friends

NINOTCHKA
Oh they shouldnt do such things
Are you sure this report is correct

RAZININ
It gives details which couldnt be
invented Naturally I want to verify
it and thats why I need you

NINOTCHKA
(apprehensively)
You want me to go to Constantinople

RAZININ
Yes leaving immediately

NINOTCHKA

(her one object to

escape the mission)
I appreciate the confidence you show
in me but I must ask you to entrust
someone else with this mission I
should hate to interrupt my present
work I am positive that my survey
is more important than finding out

How can I make myself clear It is

NINOTCHKA
Youve done it again and I am
responsible How can you forget
yourselves this way You were sent
here to make money not to spend it
IRANOFF
Buljanoff she still has those old-
fashioned Bolshevik ideas

BULJANOFF
It is high time you got out of Russia

NINOTCHKA
(not knowing what to
do with the three
rascals)
I must be stern with you

KOPALSKI
(delighted)
Thats our old Ninotchka

BULJANOFF AND IRANOFF
(agreeing with him)
Yes yes

NINOTCHKA
Dont forget the day will come when
you will have to face Razinin

BULJANOFF
(cockily)
Good old Razinin Is he still alive
How does he manage

NINOTCHKA
But Comrades

KOPALSKI
(with the happiness
of being free again
in his voice)
We are not comrades any more we
are friends Ninotchka

BULJANOFF
Imagine we dont have to whisper
any longer

IRANOFF
We can say whatever we want We can
shout we can complain Look

(he opens the door
leading to corridor)

The service in this hotel is terrible
(he closes the door)

See Nobody comes nobody pays any
attention Thats freedom

BULJANOFF
(dryly)
No thats bad management

NINOTCHKA
Is it possible to bring you back to
reality for a moment I must have a
complete report of your negotiations
and a detailed expense account

BULJANOFF
Dont ask for it Ninotchka There
is a Turkish proverb which says If

something smells bad why put your
nose in it

NINOTCHKA
And there is a Russian saying The
cat who has cream on his whiskers
had better find good excuses

BULJANOFF
With our cream situation what it is
it is Russia which should apologize
to the cats

NINOTCHKA
(helplessly)
Friends friends Buljanoff
Iranoff

KOPALSKI
(afraid of being left
out)
and Kopalski

NINOTCHKA
(pleadingly)
Dont make it difficult for me This
is no more a pleasure trip for me
than it is for you

IRANOFF
That was our idea when we first came
All we thought we would get out of
this trip was a Turkish bath but
we learned better

KOPALSKI
Ninotchka we are in the magic East
the country of Aladdin and His Lamp

IRANOFF
Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves
into one single hour you can crowd a
thousand and one nights

BULJANOFF
All you have to do is say open
sesame

NINOTCHKA
I dont know how I can get you out
of it this time How will it end
What will happen to you

BULJANOFF
(intimately)
Shall we tell her

IRANOFF AND KOPALSKI
Yes

BULJANOFF
(proudly)
Ninotchka I hope youll be our guest

NINOTCHKA
Guest

BULJANOFF
We have opened a restaurant

IRANOFF
we have a wonderful electric sign
Dine With Buljanof Iranoff and

NINOTCHKA

KOPALSKI

(singing the song of

freedom)
Dont call it desertion Our little
restaurant that is our Russia
the Russia of borscht the Russia of
beef Stroganoff blinis with sour
cream

IRANOFF
the Russia of piroshki people
will eat and love it

BULJANOFF
We are not only serving good food
we are serving our country we are

making friends

NINOTCHKA
(completely bewildered)
Who gave you this idea What is
responsible for all this

KOPALSKI
(with a gleam in his
eye)
Theres something in Constantinople
something irresistible

IRANOFF
it is in the air it may come
around the corner as you walk down
the street
BULJANOFF
it may step out of a bazaar it
may wait for you in a corridor it
may hide in the shadow of a
minaret
KOPALSKI
(pointing to the
balcony)

Right now its on the balcony

Ninotchka looks toward the balcony and is dumbfounded
as she

sees Leon standing there smiling at her He walks
quietly

toward her

LEON
(looking longingly at
Ninotchka)
They wouldnt let me in so I had to
get you out

NINOTCHKA
(still taken aback)
So -- youre behind all this I should
have known
Leon takes her hand and kisses it The Three Russians
exchange

glances The CAMERA PANS WITH THEM --leaving Ninotchka
and

Leon as Russians walk discreetly out of the room and
close

the door behind them

CLOSE SHOT -- LEON AND NINOTCHKA

LEON
Trying to keep me away from you It
couldnt be done Naturally I couldnt
go on forever punching passport
officials in the nose -- but I found
a way didnt I Darling I had to
see you I wrote and wrote but all
my letters came back

NINOTCHKA
The one I got they wouldnt let me
read
(carried away by
emotion)
It began Ninotchka my darling
and ended Yours Leon

LEON
(with great feeling
and sincerity)
I wont tell you what came between
Ill prove it It will take a long
time Ninotchka at least a
lifetime

Ninotchka is aware that she is facing a decision She
knows

what she wants but still tries to evade a definite
answer

NINOTCHKA
But Leon I am only here for a few
days

LEON
If you dont stay with me Ill have
to continue my fight Ill travel
wherever Russian commissions are
Ill turn them all into Buljanoffs
Iranoffs and Kopalskis The world
will be crowded with Russian
restaurants Ill depopulate Russia
Once you saved your country by going
back This time you can save it by
staying here

NINOTCHKA
Well when it is a choice between my
personal interest and the good of my
country how can I waver No one
shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian

Leon takes her in his arms they kiss as we

FADE
OUT
