of her shoes stretching out stickily Two steps later
piece of paper sticks to the gum flopping awkwardly
each step

The MOVING CAMERA PANS UP her gorgeous legs and

body She wears a loose summer dress that floats like

around her soft curves Her hair is long and blond

NED (VO)
To some guys women are like a cheap
puzzle with pieces that just dont
fit They think the soul of a woman
is darker than a back alley more
tangled than a telephone cord and

colder than a Klondike Bar in Canada

Ned

steps over to the railing gazes out at the ocean

A SAXOPHONE begins to wail a scorching romantic
melodya
recurrent tune that will come to be known as LOLAS

tries to ignore her presence peering into the

darkness
Lola digs in her purse for a pack of cigarettes

purse
She pulls a cigarette out of the pack puts it to her

them back in his pocket

smearing it all over her making it worse She watches
with a cool detached gaze as he fumbles ingenuously
Suddenly Ned stops looking off He sees Milo
going into the PUBLIC RESTROOM Ned starts to leave

LOLA

IN THE ALLEY

Milo runs into a tall chain link fence at the end of
alley and scrambles up the wire mesh Suddenly Neds
shoots out grabs Milos ankle yanking him down hard
Milo jumps to his feet swinging at Ned who catches
fist with his hand stopping it cold neatly snapping
handcuff on his wrist He shoves Milos arm against the

shoves his finger into the end of the barrel Milo
looks
surprised then sneers clicking the hammer back
NED
You take science in high school
Milo
MILO

I skipped high school cop

NED

Then youre probably not familiar
with the theory of inverse
proportionate explosive dynamics

MILO
What about it

NED
If you fire a weapon with the barrel
obstructed the explosive force
multiplies by twenty-three point
five nine eight and reverses on itself
with diametric polarity

MILO
Yeah So

NED
The gun will blow up in your hand
and it wont even scorch my pinkie

MILO
Ha Thats just theoretical
hypothesis Inverse proportionate
explosive dynamics has never been
demonstrated conclusively ina
laboratory environment

NED
Oh yeah Then pull the trigger smart
guy Lets find out

Milo hesitates unsure Finally he releases the gun
Ned
raises it up on the end of his finger Arch pulls it
off
with a loud POP

He gives her shoulder a consoling squeeze then exits

NED
Things just dont look the same
Its fuzzy and frightening

NEW ANGLE - TO INCLUDE NED AND JURY

The nylon pantyhose are draped over the frightened face
WOMAN JUROR All the other Jurors are holding up their
socks and nylon stockings trying to peer through them

Ned steps over to Milo motioning toward him

NED
Ladies and gentlemen Milo Crumley
is not the perpetrator here He is

the VICTIM
Milo unwraps a piece of bubble gum and pushes it into
panty-hose covered mouth chewing the nylon and gum
NED
Like ALL of us this man is the
unfortunate victim of these tragically
difficult economic times And what
does that mean He cant support his
family
Ned motions toward the gallery where we SEE

-MILOS WIFE and TWO CHILDREN all wearing panty hose

their faces Ned motions toward Milo
NED
For Gods sake He cant even
support his own FACE

JUDGE ALLEN notices that Milo is chewing gum
JUDGE ALLEN

Mr Crumley you cannot chew gum

in my courtroom unless you have

enough for everyone

Milo holds up a big plastic bag filled with bubble gum

Judge
Allen grabs it takes a piece of gum and hands it to
the
Bailiff
JUDGE ALLEN
Bailiff Pass these out
The Bailiff takes the bag offers one to Ned who
takes a
piece unwraps it and starts chewing The Bailiff then
proceeds to pass out gum to EVERYONE in the courtroom
The JURY FOREMAN raises his hand and clears his throat
JUDGE ALLEN
And dont forget the jury
NED
And so desperate and broke with no
other options before him Mr Crumley
went to eleven Savings and Loans and
did what any of you would have done
He stole back the money that the
SandLs had stolen from him
The courtroom erupts in CHEERS Judge Allen raps the
gavel
JUDGE ALLEN

bench

NED
I call Detective Ned Ravine
There is a surprised GASP from the crowd and a loud

The BAILIFF holds out a video box Its titled HOLY
THE VIDEO Ned puts one hand on it raises the other

BAILIFF
Do you swear to tell the truth the
whole truth and nothing but the truth
so help you God

NED
I do
Ned sits down then gets up his demeanor changing
NED

Detective Ravine at the time of the
arrest did you read the defendant
his Miranda rights

He slips back into the witness box

NED
Of course Thats standard procedure

Ned steps over to Arch who is sitting in the first row
the gallery Arch hands him the Miranda cue cards
NED
Are these the cards Officer Brooks
used to prompt you while reading Mr

Crumley his rights

He lays them on the corner of the stand then slips
the chair He picks the cards up and flips thru them
On the
back we can see scribbled NEDS IDIOT CARDS

NED
Yeah These are them

Ned jumps to his feet pacing dramatically grabbing
the
cards

NED
Reading from the cards now quote
You have the right to remain silent
if you waive that right anything
you say may be used against you
in a court of law Is that right

NED
(back in the chair)
Thats right

NED

(stands up announces)
WRONG The official Miranda warning
is anything you say CAN be used
against you in a court of law Not
may CAN

(on the attack)
Dont you know the difference between
can and may Detective Every
school kid knows can is a verb
that indicates ability to perform
while may is a verbal auxiliary
indicating the permission to act

Ned pivots into the witness stand changing his
attitude

from aggressive attorney to defensive angry witness as
he

hits the chair

NED
I didnt have time to worry about
past participles or interrogative
pronouns I was trying to protect
society from a deranged MADMAN

But this ivy league fop

grounds of improper grammar

The Judge smacks Neds hand with a ruler

NED
Ow

But your Honor

JUDGE ALLEN
I know I know Its a technicality
But its the kind of technicality
that makes the American legal system

on the bench like a gavel BAM BAM BAM It is

kisses him hungrily slipping a frilly plastic shower

cap
with a gaudy floral design on his head
LANA

place
She walks to the living room Frank follows still
wearing

the shower cap Lana snaps her fingers

LANA
Sit down

He sits in a chair looking around

FRANK

LANA

How about a translation

He flips through scanning the pages shrugging

FRANK
Standard accident policy all the
usual stuff blah blah blah The
face value is Wow Not bad Three
million bucks
(flips page)

And theres a triple indemnity rider

LANA
Meaning

FRANK
Aw its just something agents throw
in so we can boost the premium If
the policy holder dies under very
specific conditions it pays off
three times the face value of the
policy
to

LANA

Nine million dollars
FRANK
Yeah but its a sure bet for the

company Nobody ever collects

LANA
Why not
FRANK
Well like here it only pays off

if hes shot with a pistol falls
from a moving northbound train and
drowns in a fresh water stream

LANA
All three

FRANK
See what I mean sweetheart What
are the odds of that

LANA
It could happen
(dramatic beat)
Suppose it did happen

FRANK
Then youd be rich

LANA
Then wed be rich

FRANK
Whatre you sayin

She drops to her knees in front of him her face close
his speaking with a persuasive urgency

LANA
Were gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch
And I know exactly how He has a
legal symposium in Santa Barbara

fingers at her side He follows
She steps to a table pulls the cover off an elaborate
model of Dealey Plaza and a train station complete

Scale model trains chugging around the tracks

She uses a pointer to trace the route to the depot

LANA
Then we give him a lift to the
train station through Dealey Plaza

past the Book Suppository and around
the grassy knoll

FRANK

Ignoring this she turns the LIGHTS OFF walks over to
screen and picks up a remote control She clicks the
A SLIDE PROJECTOR comes on throwing an IMAGE on

back We can read the words THE PLAN

LANA

He moves over THE PLAN appears on the screen

LANA
And pay attention

As she talks IMAGES appear on the screen accompanying
rapid spiel We see a shot of the depot a map of the
route a gun a river a Bingo game baseball action

huge dollar sign
LANA
Ten minutes out of the station hell
be standing in the vestibule between
cars trying to avoid a panic
attack Fourteen minutes and ten
seconds out the train crosses the
Santa Ynez River So at thirteen
minutes and fifty-four seconds I
shoot him shove him out the door
he hits the river and drowns Bingo
A triple play Were rich

The lights click ON

FRANK

LANA
No It just came to me

I had this image of a big powerful
throbbing train plunging into a
long dark wet tunnel

They embrace kissing passionately dropping out of

The model train CHUGS faster the train whistle
SHRIEKING a

long Woo000000-woc00000000 racing into a model

from the bowl and approaches the defense table

Ned shoves the BANANA and two PLUMS into a
demonstration

blender on the defense table He hits the puree button
and

the blender WHIRRS loudly

pulverizing the private parts of
the man she loves

out pushing her back hair flying wildly

Her backside hits the railing where Lana has cut it
wood splintering

in mid-air for a moment like a cartoon character arms
flailing Then WHOOM she FALLS to the marble

below hitting with a LOUD THUD

and revulsion he throws the weapon down
INT KITCHEN - SAME TIME
Laura pulls TWO REVOLVERS from her purse spinning

like John Wayne expertly tossing one over her back
catching it in front She heads for the foyer

INT FOYER - A MOMENT LATER - ON LOLAS BODY
Laura pauses looks down at Lolas body notices

She pushes Lolas skirt a bit higher with the toe of

shoe

She looks up sees a light emanating from the

ON THE LANDING

Laura moves through the shadows stops outside the

She swivels into the doorway taking a shooters

Lolas feet move steadily up each stair her bloody
grasping the ice pick

INT BATHROOM FLOOR - LOW ANGLE

Lanas feet step out of the tub water dripping all
She picks up the pointed saw from the floor

ON THE LANDING

Ned and Laura still embrace her forearms crisscrossed
his neck Its been a long embrace

Suddenly Lana and Lola both appear SCREAMING like

Lana charges from the bathroom grasping the sharp saw

Lola races at them from the stairway with the ice

Without missing a beat Laura raises the barrels of
guns and FIRES at them simultaneously right next to
ears

The impact of one bullet knocks Lana all the way back
the bathroom CRASHING spectacularly out the window
other bullet sends Lola flipping down the staircase
Ned looks stunned his eyes crossed the thundering
still ringing in his ears Laura proudly blows the

away from the end of each barrel

LAURA

shyly
LAURA

Okay But I want to have kids
He hears THIS smiles at her

NED

They embrace

EXT NEDS HOUSE - WIDE SHOT - NEAR DAWN

We MOVE IN SLOWLY toward the house

NED (VO)
So maybe I was wrong Maybe women
really are like a big jigsaw puzzle
with pieces that never seem to fit
where you want â€˜em to

INT NEDS HOUSE - THE BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Ned and Laura are in bed wrapped in each others arms

NED (VO)
All I know is there are three things
that men cant possibly ever do

NEW ANGLE - NED AND LAURA
Revealing that its NOT voice over narration Ned is
actually rattling on aloud again

NED
understand women give birth
and program a VCR And giving birth
is the easy one

LAURA

NED

LAURA
Knock off the chatter will ya

He smiles at her They kiss Romantic SAXAPHONE MUSIC

begins

to play only this time its Lauras Theme

The CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY revealing Dizzy laying
on

the bed beside them playing the sax

After a beat Laura turns to Dizzy

LAURA
We wont need you anymore

Ned casually slips him a twenty dollar bill Dizzy
slips off

the bed and out the door Laura turns to Ned

LAURA
We can make our own music

Her hand reaches slowly over the edge of the bed
toward the

floor Suddenly she comes up with a CONCERTINA a
small

accordian and begins to play it

Ned lays there listening for a few moments a stunned
look

frozen on his face Then he reaches under the pillow
and

pulls out a HARMONICA and joins in

The CAMERA BOOMS UP to a HIGH ANGLE SHOT as they
play

MEDLEY of all the MUSIC heard in the film
FADE TO BLACK

After the final credit WE HEAR
LAURA (VO)
