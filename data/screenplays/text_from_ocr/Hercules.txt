THE SCRIPT
Greek statues and vases fade in
Narrator Long ago in the faraway land of ancient Greece there was a golden
age of powerful gods and extraordinary heroes And the greatest
and strongest of all these heroes was the mighty Hercules
a greek vase is shown with a picture of Hercules fighting some monster Vase
zooms in slowly
But what is the measure of a true hero Ah that is what our story is-
Muse 1 Will you listen to him Hes makin the story sound like some greek
tragedy
Muse 5 Lighten up dude
Muse 3 Well take it from here darling
Narrator You go girls
Muse 3 We are the Muses Goddeses of the arts and proclaimers of the heroes
Muse 5 Heroes like Hercules
Muse 1 Honey you mean hunk-ules Ooh Id like to make some sweet music
with him-
Muses start humming
Muse 3 Our story actually begins long before Hercules many eons ago
scene changes colors and the Muses start walking and singing
Muses (singing)
Back when the world was new
The planet Earth was down on its luck
And everywhere gigantic brutes called Titans ran amok
schematic pictures of whatever gets mentioned in the song start moving
It was a nasty place
There was a mess wherever you stepped
Where chaos reigned and the earthquakes and volcanos never slept
(Whoo Say it girlfriend)
And then along came Zeus
He hurled his thunderbolt -- He zapped
Locked those suckers in a vault -- Theyre trapped
And on his own stopped chaos on its tracks
And thats the gospel truth
The guy was too type A to just relax
And thats the worlds first dish

(yeah baby)

Zeus tamed the globe while still in his youth

Tough honey it may seem impossible

Thats the gospel truth

On Mount Olympus life was neat

And smooth as sweet vermouth

Although honey it may seem impossible

Thats the gospel truth
schematic picture of Olympus zooms in and turns into a real one While the
Muses still repeat their ahs and yeahs camera moves up the mountain
slopewhile it does the movie title HERCULES is shown Then camera goes
inside
passes various chattering gods and finds baby Hercules

Hera Hercules Behave yourself
Zeus come in to play with baby too
Zeus Oh look at this look how cute he is

Zeus babbles at baby Hercules and he catches Zeus by index finger and lifts
above his cradle
Hah Oh hes strong Like his Dad hmm
Hermes (moving through a crowd of gods) Whoa Excuse me Hot stuff coming
through Excuse me one side Ares
Hermes hand Hera a bundle of glowing flowers
Hera Why Hermes theyre lovely
Hermes Yeah you know I had Orpheus do the arrangement Isnt that too
nutty
(flying closer to Zeus now)
Fabulous party you know I havent seen this much love in a room
since
Narcissus discovered himself
Narcissus is shown staring into his mirror and making kissing sounds Also
Baby Hercules gets one of Zeus lightnings and plays with it
Hera Dear keep those away from the baby
Zeus Oh he wont hurt himself Let the kid have a little fun
Baby Hercules tryes to eat the lightning gets zapped and throws it away in
frustration Three gods jump away from its path untill Ares hits it with
his
sword so it hits a pillar which immidiately reappears

Zeus Oh on behalf of my son I want to thank you all for your wonderful
gifts

Hera What about our gift dear

Zeus Well lets see here well take hmm yes a little cirrus and

hmm

a touch of nimbostratus and a dash of cumulus
Zeus moves his hand with a little pegasus-shaped cloud on it closer to baby
Hercules and the cloud turns out to be a baby pegasus
His name is Pegasus and hes all yours son
Baby Hercules bonks his forehead against Baby Pegasus he whinnies and
icks
Hercules they hug all gods sigh
Hera Mind his head
Zeus Hes so tiny
Baby Hercules tries to bite the medallion that hangs from his neck and then
yawns
Zeus My boy My little Hercules
Hades How centimental
camera moves to Hades fast after his voice is heard

You know I havent been this choked up since I got a hunk of moussaka
caught in my throat huh
All gods look sternly at him
So is this an audience of a mosaic Hey how you doin Lookin good
Nice dress
as he is saying that he moves from one god to another untill Zeus squeezes
him in a hug
Zeus So Hades you finally made it How are things in the underworld
Hades (taking Zeus hand off his shoulder) well theyre just fine you
know
a little dark a little gloomy and as always hey full of dead
people What are you gonna do Ah Theres the little sunspot little
smootchie And here is a sucker for the little sucker eh
(he weaves a sucker with skeleton head out of thin mist)
Here you go Ya just--
Hercules squeezes Hades finger and after some fight he gets away from the
baby
sheesh uh powerful little tyke

Zeus (hugging Hades once again) Come on Hades dont be such a stiff
join the celebration
Hades (getting free from the hug again) Hey love to babe but unlike

You know by the way so charitably bestowed on me Zeus
So cant Love to but cant
Zeus You ought to slow down youll work yourself to death Hah work
yourself to death
crowd laughing
Oh I kill myself
Hades If only if only
Scene changes back to the Muses
Muse 3 If theres one god who dont want to get steamed up its Hades
cause he had an evil plan
scene changes to a boat on the river Styx in which a skeleton is carrying
Hades
Muses sing in background
He ran the underworld
But thought the dead were dull and uncouth
He was as mean as he was ruthless
And thats the gospel truth
He had a plan to shake things up
Hades feeds the three-deaded dog Cerberus
And thats the gospel truth
Hades gets on the shore
Hades Pain
Pain Coming your most lugubriousness
He trips roll on the stair and gets seated on a sharp trident
Hades Panic
Panic Oh Im sorry I can handle it
He rans but trips over Pain who just got free from the trident falls
over
and his horns get stuck in Pain the same place trident just was

A fella whod ring the bell for once not the gong
The kind who wins trophies
Wont settle for low fees
At least semipro fees
But no I get the greenhorn
Ive been out to pasture pal my ambition gone
Content to spend lazy days and to graze my lawn
But you need an advisor
A satyr but wiser
A good merchandiser and-- whoa
There goes my ulcer
Im down to one last hope and I hope its you
Though kid youre not exactly a dream come true

Phil Rule 6 When rescuing a damsel always handle with care
Hercules falls into water
No

Phil Rule 95 kid Concentrate
Rule 96 Aim
(singing)
Demigods have faced the odds and ended up a mockery
Dont believe in the stories that you read on all the crockery

It takes more then sinew
Comes down to whats in you
You have to continue
To grow
Hercules became adult now
Phil Now thats more like it
(singing)
Im down to one last shot and my last high note
Before that blasted underworld gets my goat

Hades No no no Mustnt touch
You see Megs running with a new crowd these days And not a very
lively one at that

death

Hercules Going twice

Hades Okay okay okay okay You get her out - she goes you stay

Hercules dives
Oh you know what slipped my mind Youll be dead before you can get
to her Thats not a problem is it

Hercules swims turning older and older Atropos goes to cut the thread

of life but it suddenly shines and the scissors dont cut it

Atropos Oh

outside Hercules brings the soul of Megara and puts it inside her body

Megara Wonderboy what-- why did you--

Hercules Huh People always do crazy things when they are in love
they go for a kiss but suddenly a cloud appears under their feet sent by
Zeus and they fly to Olympus

Phil Whoa Hey hey hey Whoo

Olympus (restored already) Crowd of gods welcome Hercules

Areus Three cheers for the mighty Hercules

Hermes Oh Yeah Flowers for everybody Oh

Hera Hercules were so proud of you

Hercules Mother

Zeus Hah Fine work my boy Youve done it Youre a true hero
Hera You were willing to give your life to rescue this young woman
Zeus For a true hero isnt measured by the size of his strength but

by the strength of his heart Now at last my son you can come home
Gates open gods cheer for Hercules Megara is left behind
Megara Congratulations Wonderboy Youll make one heck of a god
Hercules turns around and sees her leaving
Hercules Father this is the moment Ive always dreamed of But
he comes to Megara and takes her hand

A life without Meg even an immortal life would be empty
I-- I wish to stay on Earth with her I finally know where I belong
Zeus nods they finally kiss and Hercules stops shining
Hermes Hit it ladies

I have often dreamed

Of a far off place

Where a heros welcome
Would be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer
When they see my face

And a voice keeps sayin
This is where I meant to be
Ill be there someday

I can go the distance

I will find my way

If I can be strong

I know every mile

Will be worth my while

When I go the distance Ill be right
Where I

Belong

Down an unknown road

You embrace my fears

Though that road may wander

It will lead me to you

And a thousand years

Would be worth the wait

It might take a lifetime

But somehow Ill see it through
And I wont look back

I can go the distance

And Ill stay on track

No I wont accept defeat

Its an uphill slope

But I wont lose hope

Till I go the distance and my journey
Is complete

Oh yeah

But to look beyond the glory

Is the hardest part

For a heros strength is measured
By his heart
Hades

Hooo
Like a shooting

will search t
will face its
dont care ho
I can go the di
Till I find my
Waiting in

Your arms

HHHH

I will face its
Till I find my
Waiting in
