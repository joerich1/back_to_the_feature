FADE IN
EXT CHURCH - DOMREMY - DAY

FADE UP on ripples on the surface of a puddle Slow PAN
UP the water becomes placid and in it we see the
reflection of an inverted CROSS on the top of a small
church We move across the little churchyard and in
through the open doors

INT CHURCH - DOMREMY - DAY
Utter simplicity -- stone walls rough-hewn wooden

benches primitive saints in the stained-glass windows --
chickens peck among the straw that covers the earthen
floor

INT CONFESSIONAL BOX - CHURCH - DAY

A little wooden grill slides open and the friendly face of
the village PRIEST peers at us He glances about
perplexed

PRIEST
Is anybody there

A small hand appears -- then the face of a girl aged about
10 peering up at him through the grill The Priest
smiles a trifle wearily

PRIEST
You know Im always happy to see
you Jeanne but to keep coming here
twice three times a day

JEANNE
I need to confess

PRIEST
But you already confessed this
morning

JEANNE

I need to confess again

PRIEST
So alright What terrible sin
have you committed since then that
cant wait till tomorrow to be
forgiven

Jeanne climbs up on the prayer-stool to be tall enough to
look the Priest in the eye

JEANNE
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I
gave him some

PRIEST
Theres no sin in charity Jeanne

JEANNE
They werent my shoes Mine were
too small

PRIEST
Whose were they

JEANNE
My fathers
PRIEST
Im sure hell forgive you

JEANNE
He already did but I want God to
forgive me too

PRIEST
Jeanne -- if we were to ask
forgiveness all the time wed spend
our whole life in church

JEANNE
Is that bad

PRIEST

(perplexed)

Well no but Jeanne are you
happy at home

JEANNE
Oh yes very

PRIEST
And your mother -- everythings fine
with her

JEANNE
Oh yes shes wonderful

FLASH we see Jeannes peasant MOTHER sitting by the
fire sewing Their home is little more than a hovel -- a
low dark cave of a place traversed by a huge beam

PRIEST
Good good And your sister
Catherine -- shes still your best
friend

JEANNE
Oh yes my sisters just shes
wonderful

FLASH Jeannes sister CATHERINE sits near her
mother spinning wool

PRIEST
And what about your other friends
you dont like playing with them

JEANNE
Oh yes I play with them lots

FLASH Jeanne is battling against some reeds with a
wooden stick under a full noonday sun Not far away a
group of kids are in the shadow of a huge tree playing
One of them watches Jeanne in the distance
KID 1
Whats she doing

KID 2

Playing
Resume on the Priest

PRIEST
So everything sounds
wonderful

JEANNE
Yes it is

PRIEST
Then why are you here so often

JEANNE

I feel safe here And its where I
can talk to him

PRIEST
Him

JEANNE
Well I try and talk to him but
mostly hes the one who does the

talking

PRIEST
Who is this he

JEANNE
He never says his name

PRIEST
What does he look like

FLASH a little boy of 8 sitting on a throne ina
clearing in a wood

JEANNE
Beautiful

PRIEST
And what does he say to you

FLASH the Boy points solemnly at us but says nothing

JEANNE
He says he says I must be good
and help everyone and take care

of myself Do you think hes coming
from the sky
PRIEST
Perhaps but wherever he comes
from I think you should listen to
him because it sounds like hes
giving you very good advice

The Priest smiles and Jeanne beams back at him He
blesses her

PRIEST
Ego te absolvo in nomine Patris et
Filii et Spiritus Sancti Amen

EXT CHURCH and STREAM - DAY

Jeanne runs from the little church the weight of her sins
now happily off her shoulders Her reflection skips
across a little stream then on through a meadow of
cowslips and buttercups and up the sloping hillside
beyond

EXT MEADOW and WOOD - DUSK

A hazy summer dusk -- pollen floating in the shimmering
air Jeanne swirls between the high elms happy and
carefree -- its all a little surreal -- are those church

bells in the distance Or cow bells Or merely the SOUND
of insects

Jeanne swings round faster and faster then tumbles over
laughing and lies on her back Shes dizzy and out of
breath Above her the clouds seeming to swirl as though
she were still spinning round

The SOUND of the bells slows down deepening Her face
moves into shadow Although not distinguishable as words
at this stage theres an urgent whisper in the wind a
strange echo that will eventually resolve into a call
Jeanne

Presently Jeanne turns and sees something glinting in the
long grass A SWORD The background SOUND of the bells
grows ominous A shooting star silently flashes across
the sky -- then scores of them She gets to her feet and
picks up the heavy sword Its growing darker -- colder
-- the leaves have turned to autumn brown now blown about
by a gust of wind

Presently she sees a WOLF approaching slowly but straight
toward her -- then two three -- finally the whole pack
She grips the sword but cant use it -- too heavy too
frightened As the wolves approach she closes her
eyes

The wolves pass either side of her as though oblivious to
her presence When she opens her eyes they have passed
and are now heading along the forest track

EXT FOREST - NIGHT

Jeanne follows the wolves along the track Theyre
heading toward a red glow visible beyond the trees The
wolves disappear over a ridge though all we can see for
the moment is the red sky beyond But as Jeanne reaches
the edge we move up with her to see

her village in the valley below ablaze

EXT DOMREMY VILLAGE - NIGHT

Panic -- screams -- crashing timbers -- animals stampeding
-- wolves drag corpses from gutted buildings -- and
through the midst of the tumult tears Jeanne still
dragging the sword she found She runs inside a farm
cottage

INT JEANNES HOME - NIGHT
The low dark building we saw earlier -- now empty lit by

the fires of the houses on the far side of the street
Jeanne runs in searching about --

JEANNE
Mother
No response She begins to panic -- runs through into a
smaller room beyond calling out --
JEANNE

Catherine

Suddenly a door swings open and a hand reaches out --
Jeanne screams then turns to see her elder sister
CATHERINE whos been hiding in a cupboard

CATHERINE
Jeanne

Catherine embraces her hugging her in relief --

CATHERINE
Are you alright Did they hurt you

JEANNE
No no Im fine really

CATHERINE
I was so worried -- weve all been
looking for you The English are
everywhere O thank you lord

She hugs her again -- then freezes hearing the SOUND of
horses the clanking of armor But Jeanne hasnt heard

JEANNE
I was in church
Catherine glances about ears tuned
CATHERINE
Really
JEANNE

I was talking to the priest and do
you know what he said to me

Catherine puts her hand across Jeannes mouth --

CATHERINE
Shhh tell me later

She hears the drunken laughter getting closer

CATHERINE
Quick -- hide in here

JEANNE
What about you

CATHERINE
Dont worry about me -- just stay in
here and dont move

JEANNE

But where are you going to be

CATHERINE
Ill be right here I promise

Catherine quickly lifts Jeanne inside the cupboard locks
the door then turns to confront THREE hefty ruffians
calling themselves soldiers The biggest and ugliest has
a jet black beard

BLACKBEARD
Now thats what I call booty

Blackbeard turns back to his comrades who are sharing out
a roast chicken between them Catherine picks up the
sword dropped by Jeanne as Blackbeard swaggers up to
her

BLACKBEARD
A woman with a sword
(to his comrades)
Hey take a look at this --
Frenchmen are such cowards that
theyve left all the fighting to
women

CATHERINE
Tf thats Gods will then so be it

Blackbeards comrades start tucking into their food
leaving Blackbeard to his pleasure

BLACKBEARD
Fine with me I love women

He undoes his buckle From her POV behind the cupboard
door Jeanne can just about see Blackbeards face through
a crack Catherine raises the heavy sword as Blackbeard
advances then brings it sweeping down But he intercepts
it effortlessly grasping the blade as though it were a
twig

BLACKBEARD
Oh now youve hurt my feeling

He puts his hand around her throat rips off her little
wooden cross pins her against the door then with a

lecherous roar plunges his face on her

Jeanne is terrified Blackbeard has his tunic down and is

attempting to gain entry -- Catherine tries to scream --
he slams his hand over her mouth -- she bites it --
Blackbeard howls with laughter Now his juices are

really moving Catherine squirms against the door
twisting and turning --

BLACKBEARD
Hold still bitch How can I do it
if you keep wriggling about

He picks her up by the throat lifts her clear off the
floor by several inches then rams the sword clean through
her gut and the door behind her the blade just missing
Jeanne

BLACKBEARD
There thats better

With a grin at his comrades Blackbeard resumes his
intercourse with the lifeless Catherine Behind the door
Jeanne is suffocating with terror

The little wooden necklace lies on the floor in fg as
Blackbeard pulls up his pants and turns to his comrades --

BLACKBEARD
Your turn
EXT CHURCHYARD - VILLAGE - DAY

The little village church is no more than a smoldering

pile of rubble -- among it
an angel
shallow graves
each grave in turn

administering hasty last rites

the twisted stained-glass of
Corpses are piled up alongside a warren of
awaiting committal

The Priest passes by
then

moving onto the next while a harassed grave-digger fills

in the last

Jeanne stands by a shallow grave

wooden cross and grazing fixedly at her body

linen and awaiting interment
adults stand nearby
them from the waist down

now wearing her sisters
wrapped in

Her parents and other
but at Jeannes level we only see

MAN 1 (0S)
We shouldnt be doing this by
daylight its too dangerous

MAN 2 (OS)
Youre right -- the English are

still around -- I can smell them

MAN 3 (0S)
When is the king going to do
something

MAN 1 (0S)
Hes good for nothing

MAN 2 (OS)

Yeah

we cant even be sure he

really is a king
(whispering)
I heard someone say hes a

bastard

With a mother like that
be surprised

whore

Can you show some respect
burying our children

MAN 1 (0S)
I wouldnt

shes such a

WOMAN (0OS)
Were

You should be

praying instead of cursing

MAN 2 (0S)

Thats just about all we can do

Yes

Now the Priest scurries over
rites in Latin then moves on
family have their eyes closed

because

WOMAN (0OS)
only God can help us

hurriedly mumbles the last
to the next grave Jeannes
in prayer and it is only
Jeanne who sees the Grave-digger nudge the corpse into the
shallow grave with his foot He shovels in the earth
then moves on The Father puts his hand on her shoulder

FATHER
Listen Jeanne your Uncle and
Aunt are taking you to their house
for a few weeks just to give us

time to rebuild what we can

Jeanne looks at him blankly her thoughts too deep for
tears

EXT VILLAGE and ROAD - DAY

Jeanne sits on the back of a small hay-wagon Her Uncle
and Aunt are up front eyes on the barren devastated
countryside ahead while Jeanne gazes fixedly on the road
behind From her POV the receding figures of her
parents gradually merging with the dusty landscape

INT DAXARTS HOUSE - NIGHT

A large low room almost identical to Jeannes house a
bare earthen floor with chickens running about anda
huge cave of a fireplace The Aunt doles out soup from a
cauldron -- first to her husband then to Jeanne

DAXART
Lord we give thanks for the food
you have given us Teach us always
to love this land and to save it
from those who seek to destroy it
Amen

Jeanne says nothing -- noted by Daxart His wife nudges
him with a gesture to let her be

INT DAXART ATTIC - NIGHT

Daxart opens the door to an attic room his wife standing
behind him with Jeanne She wanders into the room tidy
but sparse and sits on the edge of the bed Daxart looks

a little put out

DAXART
So good night then

The Aunt understands Jeanne better than her husband and
leads him from the room

INT SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

The Daxarts share the communal sleeping area with a couple
of goats and a mangy dog Daxart is settling down to
sleep but his wife lies awake

AUNT
Whats going to happen to her

DAXART
Shell be fine Shell grow up
find a good man make him some
children Dont worry -- shes been

hurt but shell survive Tomorrow
shell be as right as rain youll
see

INT DAXART ATTIC - DAY

Daxart opens the door to the attic Jeanne has not moved
shes still sitting on the bed like the day before

JEANNE
I want to see a priest

INT VILLAGE CHURCH - DAY

Christ crucified in stained glass A silver cup is
raised in blessing

The local PRIEST much older than the one at Domremy
lowers the cup filled with wine in preparation for the
Mass The Daxarts enter the church at the far end with
Jeanne between them The Priest is expecting her

INT CONFESSIONAL BOX - DAY

Jeanne sits in the shielded darkness of the confessional
box She clutches at her little wooden cross and at last
begins to cry

PRIEST
I heard about your sister andl
understand your pain

JEANNE
Why did she have to die

PRIEST
Only God knows the answer to that

JEANNE
I know Jesus says to love our
enemies but I cant -- I just want

the English to burn in hell for ever
and ever

PRIEST
I realize your anger Jeanne but we
must learn to forgive Its hard
but revenge will never bring about
peace

JEANNE
Then what will And what will bring
her back And why did she have to
die in the first place instead of
me Why didnt he take my life
instead of hers It was my fault --

I was late -- she gave me her hiding
place

PRIEST
Jeanne calm down Calm down
Jeanne

Jeanne breaks off trembling tears pouring down her

cheeks

Jeanne clams down

moment

PRIEST
I dont pretend to know Gods will
but I am sure of one thing -- the

Lord always has a good reason
Perhaps he saved you because he
needs you for some higher
calling So as long as you
answer that call your sister will
not have died in vain

JEANNE
I dont want to wait for his call

PRIEST
Jeanne be patient

JEANNE
I want to be with him always

PRIEST
Soon youll be able to take the Holy
Mass and as you eat of his flesh
and drink of his blood you will be
at one with him

JEANNE
I want to be at one with Him now

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

She stares at the Priest for a long
and her look becomes very deep and intense

On the open road with Jeanne sitting on the back of
Daxarts wagon Its a grey lowering dismal sort of
day The Daxarts are up front talking in low voices

DAXART
What did he say

AUNT
He says we must bring her to church
whenever she wants

DAXART
Hmmm easy for him -- hes not the

one that has to do the bringing

Behind them the wagon is empty Jeanne is long gone

EXT COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

The rain pours down in torrents -- Jeanne runs

EXT VILLAGE - DAY

down the deserted road -- into the church

INT VILLAGE CHURCH - DAY

and up the aisle to the altar She grabs a jug of
wine pours some into the chalice -- holds it up high as
the Priest did then gulps it down The wine cascades
from her mouth like blood as she gazes up at the stained
glass image --

JEANNE
I want to be with you now

INT DAXART HOUSE - DAWN
Daxart sits bolt upright awaking from a nightmare Its
early morning his wife still asleep beyond him
INT EXT DAXART ATTICPOV OF FIELD - DAWN
Daxart opens the door to Jeannes room Empty the bed
unslept in He walks in -- hears something Looking out
of the window he sees --
Jeanne in the distance playing be herself Daxart

smiles

EXT HOUSE and FIELD - DAWN

Jeanne pauses her stick poised in mid-air --

SUBLIMINAL FLASH --

-- a real sword impales a soldier through the stomach --
another sword slices through chain-mail -- and a severed
head encased in metal spins lose from armored shoulders

EXT HOUSE and FIELD - DAWN
Jeanne looks at Daxart

JEANNE
Im playing

Once again Jeanne raises her stick-sword -- the head of a
sunflower is violently decapitated --

INT CHINON - STATE ROOM - DAY

-- and a sword swishes down trying to hack someone in the
leg But it is only a wooden sword and its wielder a
mere boy of five This is young Prince LOUIS practicing
his nascent swordsmanship on the castle GUARDS

VOICES and approaching footsteps alert the Guards who
quickly stand to attention as a door is swung open

GUARD
The Dauphin

Louis takes advantage of the Guards forced immobility and
jabs one of them in the leg he lets out a muffled Ow

The Dauphin CHARLES VII enters followed by his courtiers
They include the bloated REGNAULT Archbishop of Rheims
and Georges de la TREMOILLE -- a sly and devious diplomat

CHARLES
Louis shouldnt you be learning
your lessons

LOUIS
I dont want to learn I want to
fight

CHARLES
You will you will But for now
you must learn at least to wipe
your nose

Charles (who speaks with a slight stutter) affectionately
wipes his sons nose with a corner of his shirt Beyond
them a young soldier Jean dAULON arrives with a
scroll

AULON
A letter for His Majesty

Tremoille takes it opens the seal and begins to read
Charles hands over Louis to a courtier

TREMOILLE
Another one from this girl calling
herself the Maiden of Lorraine

Charles snatches it somewhat testily from Tremoille

CHARLES
I can read for myself you know

While Charles reads Tremoille turns aside to Regnault --

TREMOILLE
She pretends shes been sent by God
These charlatans -- its a pity
there isnt enough wood to burn them
all

CHARLES
She says shell be here tomorrow

TREMOILLE
You mustnt see her my lord We
know nothing about her we dont

even know if she is from Lorraine

CHARLES
What difference does it make where
she comes from

TREMOILLE
If she comes from Burgundy it makes
a difference It might be a trap
(takes back letter)

Look Signed X What sort of
name is X Or must we conclude
that a messenger of God cant even
write her own name

REGNAULT
My lord Tremoille is correct She
says she hears voices she may be
a sorceress a witch

CHARLES
(snatching back
letter)
Regnault -- you see witches
everywhere Shes just a peasant

a peasant who cares for her king
Look all she wants is to help me
win my crown and permission to
fight for me

TREMOILLE

Not exactly
(takes back letter)

She wants you to give her an army --
at your expanse Bearing in mind
that your mother stole every last
piece of gold in the treasury I
fail to see how you can afford such
an adventure

CHARLES
(snatches back
letter)
I can see her if I want to I mean
with half of France in the hands of
the English what have I got to
lose

TREMOILLE
The other half

REGNAULT
You mustnt see her my lord She
may be an instrument of the devil

YOLANDE (0OS)
Well I think you should

All eyes turn to the window where Yolande has been
standing with her back to the room reading a little book
Her right-arm is standing beside her -- RICHMOND his face
hideously disfigured by battle scars

CHARLES
Ah Yolande and what makes you
think the exact opposite of my two
most trusted advisors

Yolande smiles though hardly a devoted smile Mild
contempt would be more accurate

YOLANDE
Because I care about you Come here

Charles walks over He has his shirt undone Yolande
buttons it back up

YOLANDE
Your health and happiness has always
been my first concern Charles
ever since you were a little boy --
and I think I know you better than
your own mother

CHARLES
You think

YOLANDE
Mmmm Yes I know for example the
sickness that plagues your heart I
know how painful it is for you to
have loved a father without ever
knowing if he really was yours

CHARLES
W-w-what has that got to do with
this Maiden

YOLANDE
Who better than a messenger from God
to give answers to your questions

CHARLES
You really think shes been sent
by God

YOLANDE

Youre a fine judge of character
Charles Itll take you less than
five minutes to expose her if shes
a fake But if shes not -- then
she will give you your answers
and place the crown on your head

Charles shines at the prospect but Tremoille and Regnault
look less than happy

TREMOILLE
With respect my lady I think its
going to take more than just a
simple peasant girl to

YOLANDE
Im not interested in what you
think Tremoille -- or even what I
think Its what simple people

think that matters and the fact is
that simple people up and down the
country are already talking about
her Now you know what simple
people are like always ready to
believe any old prophecy like
this one about a virgin from
Lorraine saving France

(hands Tremoille the

book)
And now this girl comes along --
from Lorraine -- and suddenly
theres a spark of hope in their

simple minds We shouldnt
disappoint them If they believe in

her -- if she can put back the fire
in our army -- then I believe in her
too

EXT CHINON - LONG SHOT - NIGHT

Moving torches gallop toward us -- a FLAME flares through
foreground with a whoosh PANNING ROUND as soldiers ride
toward the distant castle of Chinon -- a gloomy great
silhouette rising against a bloody sunset

INT CHINON - GREAT HALL - NIGHT

Celebrations after a hunt Troubadours play -- a whole
tree trunk is burning in the vast chimney A Page comes
running into the big room and hurries excitedly over to
Charles

PAGE
Shes coming your majesty with
an armed escort

CHARLES
Alright alright -- calm yourself

TREMOILLE

Your majesty I urge you not to see
this woman It all reeks of a
Burgundian trap

CHARLES
My astrologers assure me that the
hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo with

Virgo rising Have you ever noticed
on the astrological chart how the
Virgin is next to the Lion

TREMOILLE
Supposing shes an assassin

CHARLES
Tremoille Im not even king yet
whod want to assassinate me

Looking around at his courtiers They all would

EXT CHINON COURTYARD - NIGHT

A FLAME swirls in the darkness -- the urgent clatter of
horses hooves -- steaming breath in the cold night air --
the SOUND of festivities coming from the castle walls
beyond -- the horses are reined -- one whinnies as
SOLDIERS jump down onto the cobbles -- a dark cape wraps
about a figure

INT CHINON - GREAT HALL - NIGHT
Another page boy bursts in --

PAGE 2
Shes arrived my lord Shes in
the guards room

CHARLES
So I suppose Id better make a
decision

Charles glances between Tremoille Regnault and Yolande
but -- either by accident of will -- none are looking his
way He sighs deeply to the dashing open-faced young
soldier we saw earlier Jean dAULON

CHARLES
Oh dear why is life so complicated
Sometimes I really wish I could be
someone else

AULON
Thats a good idea sire

CHARLES
What do you mean

AULON
Let someone else pretend to be you
and see if

CHARLES
if she can find me -- Thats a
brilliant idea If shes really
been sent by God shell discover the
trap and if shes an assassin
shell kill the wrong man

(to the page)

Bring her up

Charles turns to a coterie of ARMY CAPTAINS standing
aside and aloof from the courtiers whom they evidently
despise

CHARLES
My dear Captains Ive had a
brilliant idea Were going to have

a little game Now lets pretend
my throne is empty Who wants to be
the king

They all put up their hands

CHARLES
Now theres a heart-warming sight
So lets see which one of you
could possibly pass as king

He turns to the Duke of ALENCON 25 strikingly handsome
in his bright gilded armor

CHARLES
Ah Alencon my noble duke my royal
cousin -- so fine so brave so rich
-- so very rich -- so far-too-rich

to be the King of France Everyone
knows Im the poorest man in my
kingdom

He turns to GILLES de Rais a dark glamorous seducer
dressed in black armor with a ring through one ear

CHARLES
Gilles de Rais Marshal of
France formidable to men

fascinating to women feared by all
Youd be perfect to sit on my

throne so perfect that you might
like it too much for my own piece of
mind

Charles turns to the bearded La Hire

CHARLES
Ah La Hire -- my angry captain
the bravest in France -- scarred by

a dozen wars but with heart and
stomach for a dozen more You could
pass for the king

LA HIRE
Damn bloody right I could

CHARLES
» until you opened your mouth No
one with a tongue like yours could
pass as the King of France

The other Captains laugh heartily

CHARLES
Ah well it looks as though its
going to have to be me after all

But wait a minute

Charles spots the shy Jean dAulon Unlike the other
court toadies Aulon is a quiet honorable man

CHARLES

Why not you -- Jean dAulon The
only man whos poorer than I am and
so the only man I can trust
Dignified honorable wise what
more could we ask of a king

AULON
My lord Im not sure that

Charles takes his coat and puts it around Aulons
shoulders

CHARLES
My dear Aulon to you it shall
befall the honor of impersonating
the royal blood

AULON
Majesty I cant

CHARLES
Why are you not ready to die for
your king

AULON
Of course I am its just that

CHARLES
Good Until then feel free to live
like a king

Laughter -- then the sound of approaching excitement
CHARLES
Hurry hurry -- on the throne

INT CORRIDOR - CHINON - NIGHT

Armored feet clank along a stone corridor --

INT GREAT HALL - CHINON - NIGHT
Charles unceremoniously dumps Aulon on the throne

AULON
Sire you know how bad I am at this
sort of game

CHARLES
So pretend its not a game

Charles abandons Aulon and disappears among his courtiers
A pair of PAGE BOYS swing open the doors the courtiers
turn expectantly Aulon tries to pose as the king
From the Courts POV a girl of 17 enters the great hall
dressed in a grubby tunic with long hair tied back
beneath a hood There could not be a more striking
contrast than the sophisticated opulent yet cowardly
courtiers and this naive rough girl almost childlike in
her simplicity and yet so focused so confident so
secure in her mission with a courage that radiates
conviction and is contagious

The courtiers step back to form a narrow channel as she
moves into the great hall Yolande marks the effect her
presence has on the court smiling at their bemused gazes

Jeanne passes the Archbishop who defends himself by
sprinkling holy water in her path Tremoille oils his way
toward her with a can-I-help ingratiating smile

JEANNE
I have come to see the Dauphin

Tremoille nods obsequiously ushering her toward Aulon
who is now visibly uneasy Jeanne stops in front of him
Aulon gazes at her Jeanne scans him a couple of times
looks at him stonily Then smiles Aulon melts his
cheeks blushing hot Jeanne cocks her head like an
inquisitive child

JEANNE
Who are you
Aulon stammers in response
AULON
Im Im Im
TREMOILLE

His most gracious majesty
Charles de Valois Dauphin of
France

She gives Aulon another smile

JEANNE
I can see you are a good man but
youre not the Dauphin
(to Tremoille)
Im sorry to insist but we have no
time to lose I must see the
Dauphin Where is he

TREMOILLE
Hes here
(a gracious gesture)
Find him yourself

A brief pause then Jeanne takes up the challenge She
moves on examining the faces acutely Although a few of

the wimpoled ladies find her simple peasant dress amusing
most are caught like moths in her flame She notices the
Three Captains (La Hire Alencon and Gilles de Rais)
edging closer together as though shielding someone
beyond

Jeanne approaches them -- they draw closer together but
now we can see Charles overtly curious yet anxious to
remain hidden His inquisitiveness wins -- but as Jeanne

walks up to him the Three Captains spring in front of
her swords drawn the tips pressing at her throat

JEANNE
Theres no need to be afraid sire

CHARLES
Im Im not the king
JEANNE
I know youre not yet -- but you

will be soon

Charles makes a gesture and the soldiers cautiously
sheath their swords

CHARLES
H-h-how did you know who I am

ALENCON
Her voices of course

GILLES
Thats him they said The one
with the big nose and bags under his
eyes

They laugh -- whereupon Jeanne rushes at Charles and
flings herself on her knees embracing him round the
ankles

Charles screams -- the 3 Captains redraw their swords --
the court gasps -- then Charles gestures the Captains to
back off

JEANNE
My gentle Dauphin I bring you good
news

Charles puts out his hand to her allowing her to rise
She draws close to him whispering

JEANNE
It is a message from the King of
Heaven For you -- and you only

Jeanne speaks with such conviction that it seems
unnecessary to doubt her Her mesmeric effect on Charles

is being noticed by his courtiers He hesitates a moment
then --

CHARLES
Follow me

He leads her from the room Tremoille hurriedly follows
them Charles turns round in the doorway barring him
further access

TREMOILLE
Your majesty I really think you

CHARLES
My dear loyal Tremoille I know I
can count on you

TREMOILLE
as always majesty

CHARLES
» to ensure our privacy I need
to talk to her Alone

Tremoille looks non-plussed

TREMOILLE
As you wish majesty

Charles disappears with Jeanne

Tremoille ire at being barred is mollified by blocking the
path of Yolande

TREMOILLE
He needs to talk to her Alone

INT CASTLE - KINGS CHAMBER - DAY

Jeanne is seated facing Charles in front of a huge fire
As the scene unfolds their faces draw closer and closer
Her voice is soft and sweet but her conviction is
absolute

JEANNE
I was about eight years old It was
a beautiful spring day I was in
the forest taking a short cut home
when the wind started blowing in the
trees -- such a strange sound --
almost like words -- as if someone
was calling

FLASH The little BOY seen earlier is seated on his chair
in the middle of the field pointing his finger at us --

INT CASTLE - KINGS CHAMBER - DAY
Charles is intrigued

JEANNE
The second time was many years
later It was autumn and I was
coming back from church when
suddenly the same violent wind
started to blow again

EXT FIELD - SFX - DAY

FLASH The wind lifts Jeanne from the ground spins
her forward and flattens her on her back her arms
outstretched Her face gazing upward at the sky

JEANNE (0S)
Everything was moving so fast -- the
wind -- the clouds -- I couldnt
move Then suddenly a shape
appeared in the middle of the sky

The fast-moving CLOUDS resolve themselves into the shape
of a face the face of an OLD MAN He opens his mouth
wide radiating a shaft of sunlight that strikes Jeanne
still lying in the field The old mans mouth seems to
form the word Jeanne but the sound that emanates is so
vast that we cant be sure

Suddenly the mouth snaps shut releasing a huge FLASH OF
LIGHT --
INT CASTLE - KINGS CHAMBER - DAY

-- Charles jumps back startled yet totally absorbed
Jeannes eyes sparkle with tears --

JEANNE
I was so frightened he was so --
so here

FLASH The Boy is still sitting in his forest seat but
now he is a beautiful young Man pointing his finger at
Jeanne --
JEANNE (0S)

I realized then that he had chosen

me but I didnt understand what it

was I had to do
Jeannes eyes sparkle with intensity

JEANNE

INT EXT

What was my mission To help my
country But how could I do that
I was only a poor girl who knew
nothing about riding or making
war so I decided to wait and not
to speak to anyone about it

CHARLES
You did well

JEANNE
I didnt wait long One day I was
going to Mass like I do every day
when the same strange wind started
blowing again

CHURCH - SFX

The double doors of a church are blown open by wind coming
from inside -- right in front of Jeanne Surreal shaft
of light criss-cross the interior from the stained-glass

windows

illuminating Jeanne in myriad hues and colors

She sways uneasily as the central stained-glass window
above the altar starts to warp and undulate like heat
waves creating a mirage The image of a beautiful
archangel slowly comes to life stepping out from the

window frame

then moving toward Jeanne

JEANNE
Everything was suddenly made clear
to me God was finally calling me
He had a mission for me -- a message
to deliver

The Archangel opens his arms to Jeanne as though to

embrace her
-- FLASH --

She drops to her knees opening her arms

INT CASTLE - KINGS CHAMBER - DAY

Charles is in suspense his face sweating

CHARLES
and what what did he say

JEANNE
He said that I have to save France
from her enemies and give her back
to God and He told me that I --
Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar
at Rheims to be crowned King of
France

Charles slowly releases the breath hes been holding --

s

and

and the brimming tears run down his cheeks Jeanne takes
his hand and places it on her own damp cheek

JEANNE
All you have to do now is put your
trust in me

Jeanne kisses his hands and Charles is almost overcome
with emotion He seems for the first time utterly
defenseless like the little hurt boy that he is

CHARLES
I trust you Jeanne -- I do -- and
I envy your certainty but how can I
be certain that I have the right to
call myself king when I dont even
know who my father is My mother
cant even remember I -- I need
to know

Jeanne gazes at him a moment then places her hands either
side of his head and draws him slowly forward until both
their foreheads are touching

FLASHES

A series of too-perfect images

1 A BELL comes crashing down on top of us --

2 The ROYAL BANNER flies triumphantly in the wind --

3 English CAPTAINS throw down their weapons and kneel in
submission before Charles --

4 Huge city GATES swing open releasing a jubilant crowd
who welcome the King in triumph --

5 CHARLES kneels in Rheims Cathedral --

6 Bejeweled HANDS place the CROWN of France on his
head --

INT CHINON - KINGS CHAMBER - DAY

Jeannes hands hold Charles head as though she has just
crowned him For Charles the fantasy has become reality

JEANNE
Do you really believe that God would
let all this happen if you were

not the true King of France

INT CASTLE - GREAT HALL - DAY

The Courtiers talk among themselves nervously awaiting
Charles to rejoin them Presently the door opens and
Charles emerges followed by Jeanne He is a man
transfigured Tremoille looks anxious Charles glances
at them their expectant eyes awaiting his verdict He
leads Jeanne across to Aulon

CHARLES
Jeanne this is -- in fact -- my
loyal friend and finest archer Jean
dAulon Jean I place her in
your care Find her suitable
lodgings -- here -- in the castle

and guard her with your life

AULON
Yes my lord

JEANNE
I dont need lodgings if were to be
marching on Orleans

CHARLES
Orleans has held out for six months
I dont suppose a few days will make
much difference Take some rest

Jeanne follows Jean dAulon from the Great Hall watched
in silence by his courtiers As soon as shes gone the
whole room is filled with the myriad buzz of opinion
Gilles gives Charles the eye

GILLES
She certainly cast a spell on you

Charles draws his three Captains aside

CHARLES
Shell cast her spell on everyone if
shes given half a chance and we
must ensure that she gets that
chance

The Captains look astonished

CHARLES
Can you imagine the effect it will
have on the English -- to see a girl

riding at the head of our army

LA HIRE
Yes Theyll bleeding wet
themselves Laughing

GILLES
Were not your favorite captains
anymore

CHARLES

No -- I mean yes -- of course
ALENCON

Charles you want to give the

command of our army to a -- woman
CHARLES

Of course not Youre the ones in

command as always but if she can

put back the fire in our soldiers
then maybe you my dear Captains
will be able to raise the siege of
Orleans What do you think

GILLES
Brilliant idea but to be really
effective why not send a whole army
of virgins

LA HIRE
Thatll put fire in my soldiers

The Captains laugh -- at Charles expense

CHARLES

Please my friends you know me
you know how certain I am about
everything but -- maybe for the
first time in my life I -- I dont
know why -- but I feel I have to
trust her and now Im asking you
-- Im begging you -- to trust me

INT ROOM - CHINON CASTLE - DAY

Jeanne blows the dust from a wooden crucifix then
replaces it above a bed Jean dAulon has brought her to
a small room in one of the castles turrets clean
plainly furnished but hardly hospitable Jeanne inspects
the room while Aulon stands by the door

AULON
Listen please accept my apologies
for you know me pretending to be
the well it wasnt really my
idea well yes it was my idea
but

JEANNE
Do you think I could have some
water

Jeanne smiles sweetly catching Aulon off guard
AULON
Yes of course water anything
else

Two page boys run into the room carrying luggage water
washing bowl and some food They are LOUIS and RAYMOND
both 13 as inseparable as they are loyal Jeanne looks
up then sits on the bed testing the horsehair mattress

JEANNE
I would like some fresh straw

AULON
Louis water and fresh straw
Louis goes running off
JEANNE

And I would like to see a priest

AULON
Now

JEANNE
Yes I didnt confess today

AULON
Right
(to Raymond)
Raymond a priest
Raymond goes running off
JEANNE
I shall also be needing a war horse
-- mine is too slow -- and armor --
and a good sword -- and an artist to
make me a banner
AULON
Now
JEANNE

Better today than tomorrow

AULON
Well uh -- this might take a
little time -- but let me see what I
can do

Hes about to leave when Jeanne adds --

JEANNE
I also need someone who can read and
write

AULON

This I can do
(Jeanne looks

surprised)
I was studying at the University of
Paris -- till the English invaded

it
JEANNE

I thought you were an archer

AULON
Yes I am Im an archer who can
read and write Who do you want to
write to

JEANNE
The King of England I want to give
them the chance to leave Orleans in
peace before I get there

Aulon just stares at her

INT GUARD HOUSE - CHINON - DAWN

Raymond hands a rolled parchment to a Rider already
mounted and waiting

EXT CHINON CASTLE and MEADOW - DAWN

The Rider gallops over the drawbridge and away

EXT CHINON - TERRACE - DAY

Tremoille stands on a terrace before Chinon watching the
rider heading down the dusty highway

TREMOILLE
I cant believe you let her send
such a letter

Charles is a short distance away watching Jeanne in a
meadow below the castle swishing a stick from side to
side

CHARLES
Shes going to do it

Tremoille exchanges a worried glance with Archbishop
Regnault who is standing behind Charles

REGNAULT

Sire its going to take more than a
letter to drive out the English

Yolande moves forward

(Charles

wife)

TREMOILLE
An army for instance

CHARLES
My captains have sworn their
support

TREMOILLE
No doubt your captains will fight
for your fine cause -- but what

about the ordinary soldier They
dont fight for causes these days
They fight for money Whos going
to pay them

YOLANDE (0OS)
I am

and grandson young Louis

CHARLES
You will

YOLANDE
For the sake of France Charles
And for the sake of my grandson

She pats Louis on the head

TREMOILLE
With respect my lady -- the
Archbishop and I have begun delicate
negotiations with the Burgundians
If we can bring them over to our
side

YOLANDE
Negotiate by all means but froma
position of strength If the
English take Orleans therell be
nothing left to negotiate -- the
rest of the country will be theirs

TREMOILLE
My lady it would be the height of
folly to let this child lead

our army in the kings name without
first verifying her true motives

REGNAULT
Tremoille is right This girl must
be subjected to a rigorous
examination by the Doctors of the
Church at Poitiers We need to be
absolutely certain that she is not
an instrument of the devil

accompanied by her daughter Mary

CHARLES
How can anyone be absolutely certain
about anything Our intuitions are
sometimes our best counselors

REGNAULT
We must listen to Mother Holy Church
before listening to our intuitions

TREMOILLE
Wait she claims to be a virgin
Well thats something we can examine
-- and be absolutely certain about

Charles hesitates -- turns to Yolande who looks somewhat
uneasy at the suggestion

YOLANDE
Why not

Charles looks across to Jeanne in the distance still
playing with her stick Suddenly she swipes at a bulrush
violently decapitating its head Charles looks worried

CHARLES
Lets find out

INT POITIERS UNIVERSITY - ROOM - NIGHT

A big spacious room into which files a procession of TEN
DOCTORS of THEOLOGY and TEN NOTABLES walking two-by-two
They divide either side of CAMERA then halt and about-—
turn facing inward with military precision Two PAGE
BOYS set up screens in front of the two rows preventing
them from viewing Jeanne who is standing on a low table
between the rows wearing a laced-up robe

Now a procession of NUNS form up behind the table Two of
them step forward on cue then proceed to loosen the
laces of Jeannes robe and roll up the hem Meanwhile an
old HAG is washing her hands

With Jeanne suitably prepared the old HAG stands in front
of her Two little Girls slip in a special stool and the
old HAG squats down enabling her to look between Jeannes
legs Only women are privy to this ritualistic
inspection the men remain standing behind the screens

Yolande waits with the disfigured Richmond near a window
The old Hag is certainly taking her time and Yolande is
getting decidedly nervous

RICHMOND
(whispering)
What if shes not

YOLANDE

Ill kill her myself

A few tense moments -- then the ancient HAG announces with

great solemnity

HAG

There is no sign of corruption or

violation She is intact

to Yolandes visible relief

INT COUNCIL ROOM - POITIERS UNIVERSITY -

DAY

A dark musty council room where theologians and learned

doctors of the Church sit in wooden tiers

Jeanne Archbishop Regnault is among them

Jean dAulon -- but he as a silent albeit
observer

examining
So too is
supportive

Jeanne stands in the center of the room hands folded

though on trial Shes evidently been here many hours

INQUISITOR 1
And what exactly was this --

vision -- wearing

JEANNE

I dont remember

INQUISITOR 2

Was it wearing a crown

JEANNE

I saw no crown

INQUISITOR 3

Well was it naked

The Court have a good chuckle

JEANNE
Do you think that God cant afford

to give him clothes

An audible reaction somewhere between amusement and
admiration A deadpan scribe carefully writes down both
questions and answers in a large vellum-bound book

INQUISITOR 1

Did this -- vision -- give you
anything -- an object like a ring
or a rosary or anything -- by which

we can verify your claim

as

JEANNE
He gave me good advice

INQUISITOR 4
During your childhood did you have
any sort of military experience

JEANNE
No

INQUISITOR
Are you practiced in the skills of
swordsmanship

JEANNE

No But Im good with a stick
A murmur of laughter though not from us

INQUISITOR 4
Do you know what a Dijon Culverin
is

JEANNE
No

INQUISITOR 4
Its an item of artillery How do
you expect to raise the siege of
Orleans if you are ignorant about
modern artillery

JEANNE
The road to Orleans is long and I
have good captains with me I will
learn fast believe me

The Inquisitor and his colleagues whisper in a huddle
Regnault remains unconvinced and indicates his strong
reservations Finally the Chief Inquisitor addresses

Jeanne

CHIEF INQUISITOR

We would like to believe you Jeanne
but we feel that if God were to want
us to believe in you he would have
sent you with a sign as proof that
we should believe in you We cannot
advise the King to entrust you with
the army merely on your assertion
Cant you do something Or show us
something Some sign to prove that
you are sent by God

JEANNE
Sire I did not come here to preform
tricks You are all much cleverer
than I am -- me I dont know A from
B -- but this much I do know that
while the people of France lie
bleeding you sit around in your
fine clothes trying to deceive me --
yet all youre doing is deceiving
yourselves You say you are men of
God yet you cant see His hand in
having guided me safely through

five hundred leagues of enemy
country to bring you His help Is
that not proof enough Or do you
want still more signs Give me
command of an army take me to
Orleans and there you will see the
sign I was sent to make

Aulon can barely restrain himself from applauding The
Chief Inquisitor reaches his decision raises his gavel
and --

EXT LES TOURELLES - ORLEANS - DAY

-- down comes a mallet SLAMMING out a safety wedge which

releases a CATAPULT -- and a huge boulder flies across the
river in the direction of Orleans

EXT BATTLEMENTS - ORLEANS - DAY

A LOOK-OUT spots the incoming missile -- yells out --
GAMACHE
45-er nor-nor-west -- straight at
us

INT DUNOIS HQ - ORLEANS - DAY
DUNOIS is alone writing a letter at a small table --

DUNOIS
Which sides that

GAMACHE (0OS)
Window side

Dunois realizes hes near the window and dives for cover
just as the massive boulder plummets through the ceiling
demolishing the table where hed been sitting seconds
before and leaving a huge hole in the wall

Dunois emerges from under a large table dusting himself
He looks thin haggard and exhausted after six months of
siege
Suddenly a young soldier -- Poton de XAINTRAILLES -- comes
bursting in ignoring the mess

XAINTRAILLES
My lord Dunois I have wonderful
news -- finally -- hes sending
her to us -- thanks be to God --
were saved -- its wonderful

DUNOIS

Calm yourself Xaintrailles Now
slowly Who has finally done what

XAINTRAILLES
The Dauphin -- hes sending us food
-- and supplies -- and an army --
led by Jeanne -- the maiden from
Lorraine -- isnt it wonderful

DUNOIS

(deadpan)

Yes its a miracle

XAINTRAILLES

And its not the first one They
say she saved a little boy who was
dying of

DUNOIS

Xaintrailles Dont talk to me
about miracles

(pointing to hole in

floor)
If I was still sitting there waiting
for a miracle Id be dead now
Anyway

Dunois looks up at the sky now visible through a hole in
the roof

XAINTRAILLES
But dont you think we should at
least go and welcome her

DUNOIS

(sighs)
As long as she brings food and
supplies shell be welcome

EXT RIVER BANK and POV OF ORLEANS - DAY

The walled city of Orleans stands in the distance on the
far side of the river Loire CAMERA CRANES DOWN to find
Dunois Xaintrailles and a small escort of soldiers
waiting atop a ridge where theyre evidently been for some
time

GAMACHE
I cant believe theyre sending a
woman

DUNOIS
Maybe they never sent anyone

TRAVELING SHOT Horses hooves galloping
GAMACHE
I wonder what color dress shell be
wearing

TRAVELING SHOT Horses breath steaming

GAMACHE
Ill wager red -- how about you

DUNOIS
Blue

TRAVELING SHOT Stirrups press into the horses flanks
DUNOIS
» with a blue ribbon in her hair
to tie up Talbot
TRAVELING SHOT the horses eyes wild and dilated
DUNOIS
Does anyone know if she even knows
how to ride a horse

TRAVELING SHOT horses legs at the triple gallop

XAINTRAILLES
She knows

THEIR POV a white banner sweeps into SHOT -- then a
knight clad in shinning white armor The knight raises
his visor to reveal -- Jeanne her face gleaming with
sweat eyes blazing Dunois is speechless

JEANNE
Were you sent by Lord Dunois

DUNOIS
Yes they were

JEANNE
Good Where are the English

DUNOIS
Everywhere Where is the food

JEANNE

Its coming -- I rode on ahead I
have to speak with the Captain of

the English army his names
Talbot

DUNOIS
I know

JEANNE

Good Can you bring me to him

DUNOIS
Hes on the other side of the river

Now La Hire and Gilles de Rais ride into view

JEANNE
So who gave the order to bring me to
this side of the river

LA HIRE
(calling to Dunois)
Hey my friend Im glad to see
your ugly damn face again

JEANNE
La Hire Im warning you -- dont
swear

LA HIRE

Sorry Jeanne
(to Dunois)
Did you both meet already

DUNOIS
Well sort of

GILLES
(to Dunois smiling)
Shes quite something huh

LA HIRE
Jeanne let me introduce the kings
half brother the dogged Lord
Dunois

JEANNE
Then Lord Dunois show me the way
to the other side of the river

She starts to move as Jean dAulon rides up --

DUNOIS
Wait wait

JEANNE
For what

DUNOIS

Because because -- I mean -- the
English have a broad sense of humor
but I mean you dont
understand to them youre a

witch working for the devil What
makes you think theyll listen to
you

JEANNE
Because if they dont Ill raise
such a war-cry against them that
they will remember us forever

DUNOIS
Well Id love to see that but
after taking counsel with my
captains I felt it would be better
to first bring the food into the
city then wait till Alencon arrives
with reinforcements before doing
anything

JEANNE
You may have been with your counsel
but Ive been with mine and Im
telling you Gods counsel is wiser
than yours and hes telling me to

speak to the English -- now
DUNOIS
(matching her anger)
Fine -- go now if you want but not

with me You may have a duty to God
but I have a duty to my people and
my people are starving So right
now Im going to take the food back
to the city and if you can please
calm down and let me accompany you
to Orleans it will be my honor to
welcome you

Gilles smiles at Jeannes evident frustration

EXT EAST GATE - STREET and SQUARE - ORLEANS - DUSK

The battered east gate of Orleans swings open anda
convoy of wagons enter the town guarded by soldiers
Jeanne and the Captains are on horseback the remainder on
foot

A group of hungry children spot the arrival their eyes
widening at the sight of the food beef mutton
chickens sacks of grain barrels of salted fish

But most of the citizens are too starved and too weary to
show much excitement hollow-eyed and emaciated they have
the expressionless faces of concentration camp inmates

La Hire is sickened at the sight

LA HIRE
Jesus Christ the goddamn English
will pay for this

JEANNE
They will -- and so will you if you
go on swearing like that

By the time the little procession has reached the main
square a CROWD has gathered Sluggishly they make way
for Jeanne and Dunois to ride between them

Now the interest in Jeanne begins to warm up -- the CROWD
press in on her Slowly at first but with increasing
fervor the pressure builds as the crowd try to touch
her

CROWD
Bless us Jeanne Save us
EXT JEANNES HOUSE - ORLEANS - NIGHT
Soldiers push back the crowd allowing Jeanne to reach a
large gabled house As she dismounts a woman runs

forward --

WOMAN
Jeanne Bless her -- touch her

The woman holds up her BABY for Jeanne to touch

JEANNE
Touch her yourself your touch is
just as good as mine
WOMAN
But youve been sent by God
JEANNE

So has everyone
Jeanne turns sharply away and walks inside the house
followed by Aulon and the others
INT HQ - ORLEANS HOUSE - NIGHT
A frustrated Jeanne marches into Dunois new war-room

Dunois enters followed by his Captains and is happy to
see a model of Orleans

DUNOIS
La Hire Gilles -- let me show you
something

The Captains go into a huddle leaving Jeanne smarting
She looks out of the window where the crowd is still
trying to catch a glimpse of her

JEANNE
Who do they think I am

AULON
Jeanne calm down You cant blame
the people -- theyve been hearing
all about you for weeks

JEANNE

Theres nothing to hear -- I havent
done anything And why havent I
done anything

(turning to the

captains)
Because none of you will listen to
me

She shouts in frustration and Dunois and the other
captains swing round Dunois waits for the echo to die

away

DUNOIS
Would you like to join us Were
about to discuss the campaign

Jeanne walks over still vexed Using the model Dunois
continues his situation briefing

DUNOIS
From here Talbot has spread his
forces between these forts up here
but in the last few days it seems --

according to our scouts -- that some
troops have been deployed to this
fort here -- which makes me think

that this is where theyll be
launching their attack from

Dunois points to St Loup -- a smaller fort to the east

GILLES
I would have thought theyd have
attacked from here where Talbot is

DUNOIS
I doubt it From here they wont be
able to utilize the river whereas
over here the current will be with
them

LA HIRE
What about this huge pile down here

DUNOIS
Thats the Tourelles The English
were planning to launch an attack
from it but then we broke down the
bridge which should keep them quiet
for a while My hunch is the
attack will come from St Loup

He pauses then turns to Jeanne somewhat apprehensively

GILLES
And what does Jeanne think

JEANNE
I dont think I leave that to God
Im nothing in all this Im just
the messenger

DUNOIS
So what is the message

JEANNE
We offer the English a last chance
to return home in peace If they
refuse we recross the river and
attack them here -- at the
Tourelles

They all look astonished Gilles grins

DUNOIS
Jeanne that really makes no sense
at all The Tourelles is virtually
impregnable besides if were on
the other side of the river
attacking the Tourelles whats to
stop Talbot attacking the city from

the north

JEANNE
God

GILLES
God why of course -- wed

forgotten about him Strange I
dont seem to remember seeing him at
Agincourt

LA HIRE
Damn right

GILLES
Oh but I forgot It was a
Sunday that explains it Gods
day off

They all laugh apart from Aulon and the page boys

JEANNE
You know I feel a great sorrow for
you because youre laughing now
but by tomorrow night some of you
will be dead and having to repeat
your jokes in front of God

DUNOIS
Jeanne with respect -- we cant
just attack the Tourelles like that
-- its a very complicated matter
and

JEANNE
What complicated about it All you
have to do is do what youre told --
what could be simpler than that
Im the drum on which God is beating
out his message -- beating so loudly
its bursting my ears -- but youre
all so full of your own voices
youre deaf to His

AULON
Jeanne be patient
Jeanne turns on him --
JEANNE
Be patient be patient is that

the only advice you can ever come up
with Ive shown more patience
than a dozen saints

DUNOIS
Jeanne you have to understand --
its not easy for us -- I mean for
our pride -- to suddenly be usurped
by a -- well with all due respect
by a girl

JEANNE
Ah so thats it To you Im just a
girl

DUNOIS
Jeanne put yourself in my shoes for
a moment -- how would you feel if
you were me

JEANNE
Knowing what I know Enormous

gratitude

Jeanne turns and heads for the door La Hire nudges
Gilles as she approaches --

LA HIRE
One hell of a girl huh

As she passes Jeanne slaps La Hire right across the
face --

JEANNE
I warned you

-- and walk out slamming the door behind her The others
stare after her while La Hire nurses his cheek

GILLES
(to La Hire)
I do love her when her fire gets
well and truly stoked

LA HIRE
Me too

A pause then the door at the other end of the room bursts
open and in walks the expansive Duke of Alencon

ALENCON
Hello my friends What a journey
but we made it Back together
again lets have some fun

He rubs his hands in anticipation then notes his
comrades expressions still recovering from Jeannes
outburst

ALENCON
Did I miss something

INT JEANNES BEDROOM - ORLEANS HOUSE - NIGHT

Jeanne draws her sword with a terrifying scrape as though
about to kill someone slices something in fg -- anda
chunk of black hair falls to the ground

JEANNE
So what if Ima girl
(cuts another chunk)
You need to look like a man to drive
out the English
(and another)
Fine lets look like a man

Aulon grabs her by the wrist to take the sword from her --

Jeanne stop it

How dare you stop
will

AULON

JEANNE
me doing Gods

Aulon wrestles to get the sword from her --

AULON

He didnt tell you to cut all your

hair off

How dare you tell
me to do

Alright whatever
not going to come
himself at least
properly

JEANNE
me what God tells

AULON
-- but since Hes
down and cut it
let someone cut it

He finally manages to grab the sword from her

AULON
Raymond -- bring me scissors
Louis -- fetch that mirror

The two page boys hop to it but
mirror Jeanne slaps it from his

when Louis brings the
hand

AULON

Jeanne stop getting so angry about
everything Calm down

Jeanne stares at him

JEANNE

I am calm Its God whos angry I
need to send a letter Now

Aulon looks at her

INT HQ - ORLEANS HOUSE - NIGHT

Dunois reads the parchment that Aulon hands to him

JEANNE (VO)

To you Henry King of England and
to you Duke of Bedford who call
yourself Regent of France obey the
King of Heaven and abandon your

siege

Dunois can scarcely believe it

He hands it to Alencon

JEANNE (VO)
» give back the keys to the other
towns you have taken and go back
home to your island

Equally bemused Alencon hands it to La Hire

JEANNE (VO)
To you Lord Talbot I beg you as
humbly as I can beg you for the
sake of the lives of your soldiers
do not bring about your own
destruction

La Hire whistles with admiration and hands it to Gilles

JEANNE (VO)
Surrender to me Jeanne the Maiden
who is sent here by God and she
will make peace with you

Gilles grins and hands back to Aulon who looks to Dunois
for an answer Dunois gives a vague nod of the head

EXT BROKEN BRIDGE - ORLEANS - NIGHT

As Jeannes letter continues Aulon walks across the
broken stone bridge that once connected the city to the
south bank of the Loire Two-thirds the way across the
bridge ends abruptly leaving a yawning gap between us and
the fortress of the Tourelles

JEANNE (VO)
but if you do not heed my
warning then we shall raise such a
battle-cry as there has not been
heard in France for a thousand
years

Aulon takes the arrow to which Jeannes letter is already
tied places it in the bow -- takes aim and fires

EXT TOURELLES - ROOFCOURTYARD - NIGHT

The arrow lands in wooden planking An English soldier
with a flaming red beard yanks it out gives it a cursory
glance grins then clambers down to the courtyard below
where soldiers are busily trimming the branches from
freshly-felled trees Redbeard hands the letter to an
English captain Glasdale

JEANNE (VO)
This is the third and last time I
will write to you

Glasdale reads it and gives his response

EXT BROKEN BRIDGE - ORLEANS - NIGHT
Aulon is still waiting at the end of the broken bridge

JEANNE (VO)
If you are still here at noon I
warn you that you will hear from me
to your very great destruction
Please give me your answer speedily

Redbeard yells out from the top of the Tourelles

REDBEARD
Go fuck yourself

INT JEANNES BEDROOM - ORLEANS HOUSE - NIGHT

Aulon hesitates then softly opens the door He tiptoes
into the room looks at Jeanne then at Louis who has
fallen asleep with the scissors still clasped somewhat
dangerously to his chest Aulon gently removes them As
he places them on the table Jeanne murmurs in her sleep
but without opening her eyes

JEANNE
What did they say
AULON
Uh they said they will think
about it
JEANNE
Good
AULON
But to be honest I dont think

theyll leave tomorrow
Jeanne is almost asleep again

JEANNE
I cant wait for tomorrow

Aulon sits in a chair nearby gazing at Jeanne who now
looks even younger with her hair shorn short like a boy

still asleep in his chair where we last saw him

Aulon awakes as she leaps to her feet strapping on her
breast plate and gauntlets

AULON
Whats going on

She tips the two page boys onto the floor
JEANNE
Oh my boys -- why didnt you wake
me up Come on hurry up --

a battle to fight and a war to be
won
Raymond runs off and Aulon takes his place helping Louis

to buckle on Jeannes armor She rushes off leaving
Louis to assist Aulon with his own armor

EXT HOUSE and STREET - ORLEANS - DAWN

Jeanne runs out of the house to where Raymond is standing
with her horse She mounts it and canters off

INT JEANNES BEDROOM - ORLEANS - DAWN

Still buckling on his own armor Aulon spots Jeannes
furled white banner leaning against the wall

EXT HOUSE and STREET - ORLEANS - DAWN

Jeanne suddenly remembers shes forgotten her banner She
turns her horse about and canters back screaming out --

JEANNE
My banner I forgot my banner

Aulon appears at the window holding her banner --
AULON
Jeanne here

Jeanne circles about and canters forward

JEANNE
Throw it

Aulon throws it down to her She catches it with one
hand turns and gallops off down the street the white
banner streaming out behind her

EXT EAST GATE - ORLEANS - DAWN

The Guard above the main gate sees the French army
approaching in full retreat He calls down

GUARD

Open the gates
EXT STREETS - ORLEANS - DAWN
Sparks fly as the hooves of Jeannes horse strike the
flint cobblestones swift and clean
EXT ST LOUP VALLEY - ORLEANS - DAWN

unlike the hundreds of hooves pounding through mud and

mire in the opposite direction
EXT EAST GATE - ORLEANS - DAWN
Jeanne reaches the gates as they are swung open and the

first of the retreating troops make it back to the city --
among them La Hire and Gilles de Rais

JEANNE
What happened Who gave the order
to attack

LA HIRE

God knows but it was a bad idea

JEANNE
(to Gilles)
Were the men confessed Where are
the priests

GILLES
(out of breath)
We didnt take them we wanted to
be fast wanted to make a surprise

attack

Dunois rides up and Jeanne assails him --

JEANNE
Dunois was it you who ordered the
attack Answer me

DUNOIS
Can we -- uh -- discuss this later

JEANNE

Sooner is better than later

Jeanne charges forward into the confused ranks of
retreating French soldiers Dunois thinks shes gone
crazy --

DUNOIS
Come back youll be killed

But Jeannes not listening Shes been waiting long
enough for this moment and now she has it theres no
going back She stands in her stirrups and shouts out --

JEANNE
Follow me and I will give you
victory

La Hire is the first to change his mind riding up behind
Jeanne like Attila the Hun as she gallops forward into the
path of the retreating French Now the Duke of Alencon

joins them and soon the whole army has turned about -- an
immense tidal wave of energy rolling back across the
valley

EXT ST LOUP FORTIFICATIONS - ORLEANS - DAY

toward the astonished English One moment they were
pursuing their hapless enemies but now an avenging angel
bears down on them sunlight glinting off her armor They
start racing back toward their own fortifications the
bastille St Loup -- a great fortress amid a network of
trenches and tunnels

The French army is finally behaving as a single organism
whereas the English cohesion fragments into shards of
individual panic -- every man for himself They regard
Jeanne as a sorceress and terror spreads like cancer
among their ranks They turn and flee back to their own
lines only to be bombarded by a fusillade of their own
missiles poorly aimed at the French

Soon the St Loup tower is ablaze the English are forced

to abandon their fortress and the French finally get to
celebrate their first victory within living memory

Jeanne has become an object of worship and veneration and
the soldiers crowd about her cheering her as their
savior Presently Dunois rides up with his Captains

DUNOIS
Its a great victory Jeanne your
victory But we must follow it
through and pursue the English back
to Talbots camp unless of course
you have another good idea

Jeanne closes her eyes a moment then smiles at Dunois
JEANNE
We return to Orleans across the

bridge at the Tourelles

GILLES
But the bridge has been pulled down

JEANNE
The English are rebuilding it

DUNOIS
How do you know

FLASH Jeanne and her army are silently moving through a
forest From her POV she notices hundreds of fresh
trees-stumps

JEANNE
You have been with your counsel and
I have been with mine

EXT TOURELLES COMPLEX - ORLEANS - DAY
The English are moving up the stripped trees we saw
earlier from the Tourelles courtyard toward the broken
bridge Glasdale surveys the operation with satisfaction
EXT TOURELLES - POV FROM ROOF - DAY
Redbeard and the other English Guards on the roof of the
Tourelles spot Jeannes army in the far distance
Redbeard calls down to Glasdale
REDBEARD
Glasdale Looks like the froggie
whores coming to pay you a visit

EXT MONASTERY - ORLEANS - DAY

Jeanne rides at the head of the army flanked by Dunois
La Hire Alencon Gilles Aulon Xaintrailles They halt

in front of a ruined monastery to the south of the
Tourelles Jeanne gives instructions for the placement of
artillery

JEANNE
Position the long-bows over there
crossbows over there -- and set up
Dijon Culverins either side of those
trees

DUNOIS
The wind will be against us

JEANNE
The wind will be with us
(to the Captains)
Do as I say

EXT TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAY

The English take up their positions along the ramparts of
the battery -- a massive square fortification surrounded
by a deep empty moat

Jeanne rides forward to the edge of the dry moat her
banner billowing in the breeze and addresses the
English

JEANNE
Glasdale can you hear me You who
call me a whore I pity your soul
and the souls of your men Yield
now to the King of Heaven and go
back to your island

GLASDALE
And you go back to Hell

Jeanne turns and gallops back to the French soldiers as
Glasdale turns coolly to Redbeard --

GLASDALE
Dont kill her till Ive had my fill
of her

-- and walks back to the Tourelles
The French have established a temporary headquarters
Dunois is drawing a map in the dirt and is preparing a
battle plan with his Captains
DUNOIS
Lets plan this attack a little more

carefully than this morning

GILLES

Good idea

JEANNE (0S)
(calling)
My fine soldiers

Dunois turns to see Jeanne standing before the army

JEANNE
This morning God gave us our first
victory but that was nothing
compared to what he is ready to give
us now I know you are tired and
hungry but I swear to you in the
name of the King of Heaven that even
if these English were hanging from
the clouds by their fingertips we
shall tear them down before
nightfall Now my brave
soldiers let those who love me
follow me

With a valiant cry a thousand soldiers tear forward
behind Jeanne Dunois is speechless Gilles lays a
sympathetic hand on his shoulder

GILLES
You were saying

Jeanne rides at full tilt down into the dry moat and for
the next few minutes the air is thick with the tumult of
battle As each successive wave swarms across the moat
so they are met by a fusillade of English flame and steel
from the battery above But the French respond with equal
fervor the Dijon Culverins deployed by Jeanne now rain
an aerial bombardment of boulders down upon the English
while their arrows darken the sky above

Jeanne reaches the base of the battery She leaps down
from her horse and starts to climb one of the ladders

being thrown up against the wall but is suddenly struck
by an arrow from the rampart above She reels -- the
ladder sways -- and Aulon catches her in his arms as she

falls back to earth Redbeard is jokingly furious --

REDBEARD
Hey you just killed my woman

The English laugh and jeer but the French are in dismay
at the sight of their Jeanne unconscious lying in
Aulons arms with the arrow wedged deep above her breast

EXT MONASTERY BEHIND TOURELLES - DAY

Aulon La Hire and Xaintrailles carry her to the ruined
monastery while the two page boys follow anxiously behind

INT ST AUGUSTINE MONASTERY - DAY

They enter the shell-shattered sanctuary of a gothic
chapel where Aulon directs them to lay Jeanne against the
wall In the distance we can hear the muffled sounds of
war but in here it is strangely quiet

The great war-lords stand in a semi-circle pathetically
wringing their hands like the seven dwarves bereaving the
stricken Snow White The sight of tears trickling down La
Hires scarred cheeks is as touching as it is pathetic
Aulon wipes her brow leaning in very close to feel her
pulse and whether her mouth exhales breath He turns to
Raymond who stands close by with Louis --

AULON
Go and find the physician I saw
him with the supplies
Raymond races off
GILLES

We have to take out the arrow now

AULON
Its in so deep -- Im afraid shell
bleed to death if we pull it out

LA HIRE
There must be something we can do
for her for Chrissakes

GILLES
(sarcastic)
Yes We can pray

LA HIRE
Good idea

La Hire turns and directs his pledge to the broken
stained-glass image of Christ above the trashed altar

LA HIRE
I swear Ill never swear again in my
life if you save her life But Im
warning you if you let her die
then youre the biggest

JEANNE
Dont swear

Jeanne stirs her eyes beginning to open

LA HIRE
He heard me

AULON

Jeanne we thought wed lost you
JEANNE
Not so easily Why arent you
fighting go on were almost
there
AULON

Jeanne youve been badly wounded

JEANNE
No its its nothing its

Speaking provokes a sudden stab of pain She tries to
clutch the arrow but Aulon stops her He peels back her

shirt

exposing the bloody wound above her pale breast

GILLES
Its an arrow and its in deep

AULON
You must stay still till the
physician arrives

LA HIRE
Physicians are a waste of time
Youll have more luck with this
charm of mine it saved my life at
Agincourt

JEANNE
Id sooner die than use magic

AULON
Jeanne you will die if that arrow
stays in you much longer

Jeanne suddenly seizes the arrow and yanks it out of her

body

Blood spurts -- the suddenness and violence of her

action catches the men unaware and its a moment before
Aulon can stem the flow with his hand Jeanne looks at
the arrow before throwing it aside

JEANNE
At least this one wont bother us
any more Now lets get back to the

fight
She tries to get up and collapses grabbing Aulon
AULON
Jeanne please you must stay
calm you must rest please

He lays her back down Jeanne whispers to him

intimately

JEANNE
Alright I promise to rest if you
promise to go back to the battle
AULON
I promise
Jeanne smiles -- then suddenly collapses
LA HIRE
Oh shit Jeanne dont die

La Hire breaks off as Raymond arrives back with the
Physician

AULON
Quickly do something

The Physician kneels beside her and listens for any sound
of life All the Captains crowd closer and closer and as
we too move closer we hear the sound of deep breathing
almost a snore

PHYSICIAN
Shes sleeping Like a baby

La Hire and the others sigh with relief

EXT TOURELLES - BATTERY - DUSK

Dunois surveys his armys attempt to storm the English
battery It is now dusk and without Jeanne the battle
has become a half-hearted affair He turns to a trumpeter
as Aulon comes running up

AULON
Jeannes alive

DUNOIS
Good

AULON

We have to press home the attack

DUNOIS
(to the Trumpeter)
Sound the retreat

AULON
But I promised Jeanne wed fight on

DUNOIS

I made no such promise Sound the
retreat for the night

AULON
But that was her order

DUNOIS

Im fed up with taking her orders
She swore shed defeat the English
before nightfall instead of which
she goes and plays the fool and gets
herself nearly killed Look at the
mess were in Thats her mess not
mine Were worse off then if
shed never come at all

(to the Trumpeter)
now do as I say and Sound the
Retreat

The Trumpeter obeys and signals the evening wrap The
English jeer and whistle from their impregnable battery as
the French head back up the sloping sides of the moat

INT ST AUGUSTINE MONASTERY - DUSK

Jeanne lies asleep inside the ruined church guarded by
her two page boys A small fire burns nearby to keep her
warm but she is shivering

EXT ORLEANS - JEANNES NIGHTMARE - NIGHT

She suddenly awakes with a start then gets up and goes to
the fire She kneels down puts her hands in the
flames and scoops up a handful of ash She paints her
face with the black ash like a native warrior then
stands back up turning to face a small army

JEANNE
My brave soldiers do you believe in
God
The Army cries out Yeesssss
JEANNE

Then let Gods punishment be done
Eye for eye

and a sudden FLASH of lightning transforms some of her
men into skeletons

JEANNE
tooth for tooth
(another flash)
» burn for burn
(another flash)
life for a life

a final FLASH and her whole army is now a seething
swarm of SKELETONS With a curdling cry of vengeance they
race forward passing either side of her

Jeanne turns to see the skeleton army heading across a
bizarre bridge and onto the moonlit battery flowing
either side of the 8 year-old BOY she saw in the woods as
a child Intrigued Jeanne follows him but by the time
she reaches him the boy has disappeared The skeletons
have also vanished to be replaced by an army of little
English boys in man-sized armor heading toward a distant
figure

The boy-soldiers are being welcomed by the beautiful MAN
Jeanne saw earlier He smiles at her extending his arms

in a Christ-like gesture of embrace

As Jeanne approaches him others turn to welcome her --

Aulon Dunois Alencon finally La Hire holding out his
arms --
LA HIRE
Jeanne come here my friend my
soldier in my arms

La Hire scoops her up into his bear-like arms and swings
her round suddenly over his shoulder she spots a
familiar figure her dead sister

JEANNE
Catherine

She breaks from La Hire and runs to Catherine throwing
her arms around her and sobbing with joy

JEANNE
Catherine oh Catherine -- I knew
you wouldnt leave me

They stand for a moment embracing each other while La
Hire and the other Captains applaud Jeannes victory The
beautiful young MAN approaches them but we now see that
he has a sword clasped behind his back

Catherines face contorts in pain She slumps forward
the sword in her back Beyond her the beautiful MAN has
transformed into the grotesque Blackbeard who roars with
laughter as Jeanne holds her dying sister

CATHERINE
Avenge me avenge me

A circle of fire forms around them with skeleton soldiers
dancing in the flames

Blackbeards echoing laugh is gradually superimposed by
real laughter and a familiar voice

REDBEARD (0OS)
Hey Frenchies what happened to
your precious angel huh

EXT TOURELLES - FRENCH CAMP - DAWN

All is quiet the troops lie sleeping Redbeard calls
through the mist from the raised drawbridge spanning the
dry moat linking the battery to the French camp --

REDBEARD
Frenchies you hear me What
happened to your little virgin

Jeanne is awake She listens to Redbeard

REDBEARD
Ill tell you what happened we
sent her back to Hell so she can go
fuck with the Devil

Now Jeanne is caressing her horse while Redbeard taunts

REDBEARD
What are you going to do Frenchies
Why not come out and fight Or are
you too busy praying to bring your
witch back from the dead Do you
hear me

Suddenly Jeanne emerges from the mist riding her horse
and brandishing her banner --

JEANNE
I hear you May God forgive your
blasphemy but I never can

She turns and disappears back into the mist

EXT TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAWN

Redbeard blinks in amazement He turns to another
soldier --

REDBEARD
Go and wake up Glasdale
EXT TOURELLES - FRENCH CAMP - DAWN
Jeanne rides along the columns of sleeping soldiers

JEANNE
Come on -- wake up -- sound trumpets

and to horse
The dazed and sleepy French drag themselves from their
straw beds Dunois emerges from his tent bleary and
half-naked

Glasdale hauls himself from his bed

EXT TOURELLES - FRENCH CAMP - DAWN

Jeanne supervises her men as they push a huge siege tower
toward the dry moat She rides over to Aulon

JEANNE
Get all the men to horse and ready
to follow

Aulon goes as Dunois hurries over

DUNOIS
Jeanne what are you doing with
that youve got it back to
front

JEANNE

I know what Im doing so either
lend a hand or go back to bed
EXT TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAWN

Redbeard watches in bewilderment as the siege machine
starts to materialize through the mist

REDBEARD
What the hell shes playing at

EXT TOURELLES - TURRET - DAWN

Glasdale is equally perplexed gazing out from his garret
window across the battery An archer is by his side

GLASDALE
Crazy bitch she doesnt even know
how to use it

EXT TOURELLES - DRY MOATBATTERY - DAWN

The French wheel the enormous siege tower toward a wooden
lip above the dry moat The drawbridge is firmly raised
on the far side Redbeards complacent expression changes
as he suddenly realizes whats about to happen

REDBEARD
Oh shit

He backs away as the machine reaches the lip Suddenly it
topples forward crashing down on top of the raised
drawbridge and demolishing it beneath its enormous
weight

EXT TOURELLES - TURRET - DAWN

From his elevated viewpoint Glasdale watches in horror as
Aulon leads the French cavalry across the siege machine
bridge that now spans the dry moat giving them access to
the battery

GLASDALE
Raise the drawbridge

The Archer passes Glasdales order along -- a chain
message that reaches the gate-keeper who promptly starts
to turn the winch

EXT TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAY

As the French swarm onto the battery Redbeard and his
soldiers turn tail and race back toward the second
drawbridge into the Tourelles

REDBEARD
Wait for me
The bridge is already being winched up Redbeard is the
first to reach it with a desperate leap he manages to

grab the lip of the bridge and scramble over

EXT TOURELLES - COURTYARD - DAY

» rolling down into the sanctuary of the Tourelles on
the far side

EXT TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAY

His comrades are less fortunate and are slaughtered by
the advancing French

Jeanne urges her troops forward her white banner
billowing in the breeze but with the drawbridge raised
there is no way for them to enter the Tourelles The
English hurl fresh insults -- and bombards -- from the
battlements above and the French are forced to take cover
behind two ruined buildings on the battery

Jeanne rides across to a ruined barn where several carts
are stacked with felled tree-trunks She spots La Hire

JEANNE
Prepare these as battering-rams

LA HIRE
Whats the use The drawbridge is
up

JEANNE

Not for long

Under a hail of English arrows Jeanne rides back across
the open battery to a ruined house on the other side She
sees Aulon and dismounts

JEANNE
The king said youre his finest
archer

AULON
Well

JEANNE

Come with me

INT RUINED HOUSE - TOURELLES - DAY
Jeanne leads Aulon through the ruined house to the far
end where a window overlooks the river-moat that

separates the battery from the Tourelles

You see those wooden beams

Jeanne points to the two beams supporting the chains of
the drawbridge further along

JEANNE

I want you to set them on fire

INT TOURELLES - TURRET - DAY

Glasdale spots Jeanne running back across the battery He
summons his Archer pointing her out

GLASDALE
Kill her

EXT TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAY

Jeanne leaves the ruined house and spots Gilles standing
with Alencon As she approaches Gilles spots the archer
in Glasdales window far above taking aim

JEANNE
Gilles -- fetch the Dijon Culverins
and place them over there

Jeanne turns her back -- the Archer fires -- Gilles holds
up his shield -- the arrow strikes it -- and Jeanne turns

back unaware that he has just saved her life

JEANNE
Clear

GILLES
Perfectly

Gilles heads off leaving Alencon looking left out

ALENCON
And me what can I do

JEANNE
Um round up the horses and keep
them safe

ALENCON

Good idea
Leaving Alencon to his task Jeanne rides off
and THUMP a flaming arrow lands in one of the
drawbridge beams
EXT TOURELLES - COMPLEX - DAY
An English soldier peers down to see both beams ablaze
SOLDIER

Fetch some water

The command is passed down the line -- a bucket is lowered
into the river and hauled back up -- the bucket rushed up
stone stairs to the soldier on the battlements

EXT TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAY
Meanwhile Jeanne returns to Dunois and La Hire --

JEANNE
Stand by with the battering-rams

DUNOIS
We need another ten minutes

JEANNE
The bridge wont wait

LA HIRE
Leave it to me

Back on the battlements the bucket of water is passed up
to the Soldier who tries to pour it over the edge and
onto the blazing beam Aulon spots him from below and
fires a flaming arrow -- it pierces the soldier who pours
the water on himself extinguishing the flames

EXT TOURELLES - COMPLEX - DAY

TIGHT SHOTS hands wind the handle of a bobbin -- a
device is activated -- a lever thrown -- a grille slides
sideways

EXT TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAY

The beams collapse -- the support chains give way -- and
the drawbridge comes crashing down Beyond it is a
portcullis but to La Hires exuberant volunteers this is
no barrier Carrying buckets of flaming oil they charge
forward

but as they race across the drawbridge a sudden
volley of high-velocity arrows discharge from the lower
apertures of the portcullis felling them before they even
get halfway across the bridge

EXT TOURELLES - COMPLEX - DAY

The English cackle with delight at the sight of the dying
French writhing in the flaming oil Redbeard -- in charge
of the multiple balista -- orders the device to be

reloaded then yells through the upper portcullis

Hey what happened to the whore
Sorry virgin

EXT TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAY

Dunois views the massacred soldiers lying on the bridge
amid the dying flames Jeanne is about to mount her
horse

REDBEARD
Send her over here and she wont
stay a virgin for long

think for once Dont you see The

EXT TOURELLES - COMPLEX - DAY
Redbeard checks the reloading of the balista
REDBEARD
What the matter Frightened of a
little English stuffing

EXT TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAY

Jeanne gently puts her arm around her horses neck
whispering to it

JEANNE
We must both be brave

She kisses it lightly then grabs her banner from Louis
calling out to the others --

JEANNE
When you see my banner touch the

door the fortress is ours

and away she rides across the drawbridge still piled
with the slaughtered men from the first attack

REDBEARD

Another volley of arrows discharges from the portcullis
and Jeannes horse collapses The English cheer

INT TOURELLES - TURRET - DAY
From his garret window high above Glasdale sees Jeanne
spread-eagled next to her dead horse on the drawbridge
below He turns to his servant with a grin
GLASDALE
This time she wont be back

EXT TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAY
Aulon gapes in horror but then suddenly Jeanne is back
up on her feet again Gripping her banner she dashes
forward toward the portcullis implanting it just as
Redbeard opens a little sliding grille -- Jeanne jabs her
banner through --

The English troops swarm either side of the broken
portcullis forcing most of the French back onto the
battery

EXT TOURELLES - BATTERY - DAY

La Hire lets out a blood-curdling primeval war-cry and
charges forward to meet the English wave head on Jeanne
is caught in the middle buffeted from side to side by a
sea of heaving sweating bleeding bodies

In this melee it is impossible to know who is friend or
foe and the images become so blurred that we and Jeanne
are soon lost in a mist of dust and noise

EXT TOURELLES - DREAM - DAY

FLASH our eyes are momentarily blinded by the sun and
when we return we find Jeanne in the middle of the
battery but now totally alone weaving her sword through
the air in SLOW MOTION as she once did with her stick

but she is now a little girl of eight playing in the
field we first saw her in The small BOY looks at her
smiling

FLASH Jeanne continues to play but is now 17 and the
boy is now a young MAN still smiling He calls out to

her

MAN

Jeanne what are you

Playing

doing

JEANNE

She sweeps her sword and decapitates a flower Blood
flows from the stalk Jeanne looks at it more in
childish curiosity than astonishment or horror She
looks at the sword the blade now streaked with blood

Jeanne what are you

Jeanne pauses looks at him steadily

MAN
doing

» and suddenly

notices that blood is trickling down his face A SHAFT OF
LIGHT blazes wind billows and suddenly its winter

the trees naked heavy with snow

What have you done to me Jeanne

face gazing deep into her eyes

his hands to her

MAN

What have you done to me

splattered face as the Man did

Are you alright

Yes

Its over Jeanne We won just as

you said

Jeanne looks about her in a daze La

Hire strides over

arms extended extravagant as always --

LA HIRE
Jeanne come here my friend my
soldier in my arms
Jeanne starts laughing -- she cant believe it

JEANNE

We won

LA HIRE
Won Such a small word will never
do This is victory Jeanne this

is glory

He scoops her up in his bear-like arms like an ebullient
lover both laughing in the moment He slowly turns her
around breathing in a great lungful of air and savoring
the smell of what Jeanne now sees over his shoulder the
entire courtyard knee-deep in bodies and bits of bodies
-- including the gallant Xaintrailles

Jeanne too can smell the reek of fresh warm gore Her
laugh turns to a cry of anguish La Hire sets her back
down

LA HIRE
Jeanne -- whats the matter
Jeanne is utterly horrified her legs tremble amber
liquid trickles down her armor
JEANNE
You call this glory All
this this blood this smell
of
LA HIRE
the smell of victory Jeanne
Mmmmmmm I love it

Its not possible

Jeanne sees a French soldier of meager wit hauling a
dying English soldier onto his knees for some obscure
purpose

GILLES
You look disappointed Isnt this
what you wanted

JEANNE
No not like this

GILLES
For weeks youve been asking for
this well now you have it

The Soldier is about to smash the Englishmans mouth with
amace Jeanne snaps out of her momentary stupor and
races across stumbling over the dead bodies

JEANNE
Stop it What are you doing

SOLDIER

Nothing just taking his teeth
JEANNE
But you cant just kill a man for
his teeth
SOLDIER

Why not He has good teeth

JEANNE
Because because you just cant

GILLES
Eye for an eye tooth for a tooth

Jeanne ignores the laconic Gilles

SOLDIER
Besides what about these

JEANNE
Thats different I mean we
were fighting for a for a cause

Gilles grins but La Hire looks genuinely bemused at
Jeannes behavior The soldier shrugs unimpressed

SOLDIER
Not me Hes my prisoner I can
take his teeth if I want to

He is about to smash the teeth

JEANNE
No

She throws herself in front of the startled Frenchman

JEANNE
Take mine instead -- here -- smash
mine first

ridiculous

JEANNE

If you kill him you kill me

Jeanne let him do it One more

dead bodys not going to make any

difference so who cares

I care And I care because God
cares All life is precious to God

for six months -- thats his only

reward Let him take a few teeth

A few teeth thats the price of
his life

She wrenches a ring from her finger and flings it at the
soldier

JEANNE
Hes mine now

Jeanne cuts the Englishmans bonds

JEANNE
Now you get out

The English soldier doesnt wait for further prompting
Gilles claps

GILLES
Bravo What about all the other
hundreds of prisoners Do we let
them go too

JEANNE
Maybe I dont know but first
we have to confess

INT AUGUSTINE MONASTERY - DAY

Jeanne marches her blood-splattered captains into the
church and up the aisle toward the rubble-strewn altar
She sees a terrified Franciscan PRIEST and grabs hold of
him

JEANNE
Please we have to be confessed
all of us now I know its not
normal custom but sometimes you
know we have to make an exception
and and today is an exception

The Priest looks confounded Jeanne turns to the
Captains

JEANNE
Hes going to confess us Kneel

All but La Hire kneel although their armor is stiff at

the joints
LA HIRE
Jeanne if you dont mind Ill
stay standing this armor its

a nightmare to get back up

JEANNE
I said kneel

Jeanne raises her sword and brings the flat blade whacking
against the back of his legs La Hire crumples and
Jeanne turns to the Priest

JEANNE
Please were ready begin
The Priest is totally lost he begins to mumble a few

words in Latin just as a soldier burst in --

SOLDIER

thousands of them on the far side

of the river

The Captains look anxiously at Jeanne She hesitates a
moment then gazes up at the battered crucifix on the
altar and closes her eyes in prayer

EXT NORTH PLATEAU - ORLEANS - DAWN

Jeanne opens her eyes It is dawn and two silent armies
are drawn up facing one another four thousand Englishmen
on the left two thousand Frenchmen on the right They
have barely had time to recover from the Tourelles and
the lust for battle is gone We sense that this is going
to be a blood bath that nobody wants

Franciscan monks move among them sprinkling them with
holy water in final absolution The battle lines are too
far apart for the English to see any details but the
sight of massed soldiers kneeling before an invisible God
is an awesome spectacle

Jeanne and the Captains are mounted facing the English

DUNOIS

Well Shall we go

JEANNE
Not yet

DUNOIS
The English wont wait

Jeanne hesitates

JEANNE
Ill go

AULON
Jeanne no

But Dunois silences him indicating to Gilles that he
should accompany her

JEANNE
Alone

Dunois is again obliged to comply and Gilles hangs back

From the English lines we see a small solitary figure
emerge from the massed ranks of French soldiers

Jeanne moves halfway between the two armies The English
soldiers watch her mesmerized while their captains
remain motionless

In the middle of the field Jeanne halts From the French
POV she looks dangerously vulnerable The English
commander -- TALBOT -- draws up alongside his Captains
watching her with grey eyes and an expression of stone
Only we see that Jeanne is crying She rubs the tears
away

JEANNE
I have a message for your King
Henry It is a message from God

The English stand silent

JEANNE
Go home Go now in peace If you
dont go now you will be buried in
this field Ive seen enough blood
for today but if you want more I
cant stop you I can only warn you
that it will be your blood not
ours

Talbot whispers something to one of his Captains He

withdraws to pass the message on Jeanne -- and her
French captains -- try to gauge the English mood

JEANNE
Im waiting for your answer

Now the English Captains start moving along their flanks
Somethings about to happen Dunois and the French watch
in dismay as the English flanks move aside exposing their
dreaded archers Jeanne closes her eyes tears brimming

JEANNE
Please Lord dont dont let
this happen dont leave me

The English archers take a step back their cavalry move
slowly forward then turn to their right the men letting
them through Dunois turns to La Hire

DUNOIS
Never wait for miracles Stand by
to attack

The serried ranks of English infantry close in then halt
Were ready for the worst and it takes Jeanne -- and us
-- a full twenty seconds to realize what is happening

the English are leaving First the cavalry then the
infantry finally the archers themselves

Jeanne cannot believe her eyes She burst out laughing
and crying at the same time The French captains gape in
astonishment Finally La Hire can contain himself no
longer --

LA HIRE
By God and all the saints now
thats what I call a bloody miracle

The French burst into jubilation

INT CHINON CASTLE - DAY

As the cheering builds we see a Messenger race along a
corridor and burst into the throne room Charles slowly
rises on hearing the joyous news clapping his hands in
delight -- not least at the discomfort of Tremoille and
Regnault But Yolande shares his enthusiasm although we
sense that the news comes as no great surprise

INT ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

The cheering continues as another Messenger races along a
similar stone corridor and bursts in on the haggard Duke
of BEDFORD He is the English regent and is in council
with several others including the Bishop of Beauvais --
one Pierre CAUCHON As Bedford hears the news the
cheering FADES He rises from his chair

BEDFORD
I want that girl I want her
burned

EXT STREET - RHEIMS - DAY

The crowd goes wild as Jeanne rides through the streets of
Rheims carrying her banner in triumph She is followed
by Aulon and her two page boys and is accompanied by
soldiers who do their best to hold the ecstatic crowd at
bay At the far end of the street a magnificent
cathedral

INT VESTRY - RHEIMS CATHEDRAL - DAY

Backstage pandemonium as Charles is readied for his
imminent coronation A glamorous Gilles tries to help him
into his ermine robe Tremoille stands with Archbishop
Regnault adjusting his gold-trimmed cloak An ancient
BISHOP -- palsied and pushing 80 -- stands by hands
a-trembling

CHARLES
Its too tight -- wheres the
seamstress And that
(pointing to crown)
thats meant to be a crown
Dont you have something more --
more regal

A young Priest is holding the dowdy crown

PRIEST
The English took the real one

CHARLES
I asked for a grandiose coronation
and this is what you give me This
whole things going to be a complete

fiasco

BISHOP
Sire we were only given three days
to prepare -- three days -- Why
your fathers coronation took three
months

Charles turns to Tremoille --

CHARLES
Hes probably right -- lets call a
delay

TREMOILLE
Theres no time sire -- we cant

hold up the ceremony theres no
telling when the English might come
back theyre only ten leagues
away

CHARLES
Let them come Let them see whos
the true king of France

Further away Dunois is examining himself in a looking-
glass He is standing with Gilles de Rais both
resplendent in their armor now cleaned and polished

DUNOIS
Its been muddy for so long I
forgot how good it looked when
cleaned up

LA HIRE
Did you remember to clean up whats

inside as well

Dunois ribs him with his elbow both laughing In another
corner Alencon is fast asleep

Charles is still grumbling

CHARLES
Those damn English we should be
doing this in Paris in Notre Dame
-- much more prestigious -- and

twice as big as this one

Yolande who has been standing quietly in the shadows with
Richmond steps forward

YOLANDE
It is the sacred place that matters
Charles -- not the size Am I
correct Bishop

BISHOP

Oh yes my lady All true kings of
France must first be anointed in our
great cathedral of Rheims with
the holy oil of Clovis for it was
within these very walls that Saint
Remy received the sacred oil from
Heaven brought to him by a white
dove for the anointing of King
Clovis

TREMOILLE
Yes yes -- well lets just get on
with it shall we

GILLES
before the English
spoil everything

turn up and

CHARLES
They wouldnt dare

GILLES
I wouldnt be so sure It only
takes one of them -- in disguise --

Gilles pulls a sharp dagger -- Charles

» with a good dagger

it takes

Gilles lifts the dagger and snips a
Charless shoulder

looks petrified
GILLES
» thats all

loose thread from

GILLES

» to ruin the whole thing

Gilles sheaths his dagger but Charles

He glances at those around him as though one of them might

is now panicking

be a spy Gilles moves away and Charles turns to his

pages --

Hurry up

CHARLES

Further away the Bishops assistant Canon hurries in

holding a small jar --

CANON

Your Grace there can be no

anointing

BISHOP

What in heavens name are you

talking about

The holy oil of Clovis
gone

CANON
-- its all

The ancient Archbishop can scarcely believe his ears He
peers inside the little jar just as Yolande arrives with

Richmond

BISHOP

Gone But thats impossible --
its magic oil I mean miraculous

oil -- it can never be

Look for yourself

exhausted

CANON

The Canon offers it to the Bishop but Yolande

intervenes
YOLANDE
Problem
He hands her the little jar
BISHOP
I dont understand the holy oil
of Clovis it was quite full the
last time I saw it
YOLANDE
And when was that
BISHOP
Well at the coronation of King
Charles VI
YOLANDE

Thirty years ago Im not surprised
its gone

BISHOP
No no you dont understand -- this
is no ordinary oil -- this is
miraculous this oil was brought
from heaven by a white dove to crown
King Clovis in this very

cathedral

Yolande has moved away to be replaced by the hideously-
scarred Richmond The Bishops voice trails as he sees

Yolande beyond him taking an oil lamp from the wall and
pouring a little oil into the jar

BISHOP
W-w-what are you doing

YOLANDE
Performing a miracle

Richmond curtails any protest with a toothy grin

Theres a growing SOUND of excitement coming from beyond
Finally Jeanne appears in the doorway carrying her banner
and followed by her faithful page boys Louis and Raymond
La Hire nudges Alencon awake as she passes giving an
admiring whistle

CHARLES
Ah Jeanne come here This
whole coronation idea of yours is a

fiasco nothing is ready

JEANNE

» You look wonderful

CHARLES
and my crown doesnt fit and
(breaking off)
Really

She looks up and down appraising him

JEANNE
You look like a king

Charles melts TRUMPETS SOUND from the great Cathedral
beyond

INT RHEIMS CATHEDRAL - DAY

Two tiers of boys sing in plainsong as Charles enters
through a small door and into the vastness of the crowded
Cathedral It is filled to capacity with Jeannes
comrades-in-arms filling the front pews like eager fans
straining for a glimpse of her

Tremoille waddles behind Charles with Regnault Yolande

and Richmond in tow Next the two page boys -- and then
at last the main attraction as far as this congregation is
concerned -- the crowd lets out an audible gasp as Jeanne

enters in her white armor carrying her proud war-scarred
banner and escorted by Jean dAulon

La Hire is so moved at the sight that he has to wipe away
big soppy tears (for sentimentality was ever the flip-side
of cruelty) Alencon and Dunois likewise gaze at their
adored one though Gilles is perhaps more taken with the
cherubic choir boys

Jeanne trembles with emotion This is the peak of her
career and she knows it and shes making the most of it
As the little procession reaches the nave all but Charles
filter aside He walks forward alone to where Archbishop
Regnault is standing -- a few paces -- then stops turns
-- and holds out his hands to Jeanne

The crowd gasp with approval at the unprecedented
gesture La Hire briefly claps before being dug in the
ribs by Gilles but the kingly act provokes jealous
looks from Regnault and Tremoille

Jeanne hesitates then is almost willed on by the crowd
into joining Charles She stands a little aside as he
kneels Regnault sprinkles the Holy Oil on his
sovereigns head

REGNAULT

With this sacred oil blessed by the
hand of God the Father Almighty we

do anoint thee Charles Valois

Regnault breaks off theres a commotion at the back of
the cathedral Charles looks around -- anxious faces turn
-- soldiers draw their swords -- is it the English

Bored by the ceremony young Louis has been kicking legs
again and one of the guards is nursing a bruised shin
With all eyes suddenly upon him Louis flushes -- and is
quickly taken in hand by Yolande After the brief
interruption Regnault continues

REGNAULT
we do anoint thee Charles
Valois Sovereign Lord and King of
this great kingdom of France
charging that ye defend the faith of
our Mother Holy Church so long as ye
shall live

It could almost be the marriage ceremony Jeanne watches
in tears trembling with emotion as the Archbishop takes

the crown and holds it above Charles head then slowly

slowly lowers it

As he does so an eerie SOUND like a bullet in slow-
motion coming straight at us followed by a cry from
Jeanne

EXT PARIS WALLS - ST DENIS - DAY
Jeanne gasps -- sways

Torrential rain sweeping across the grey mud-filled moat
in great curtains Shes standing on the bank above the
moat looking across at the massive city walls where
ladders have been set up Aulon catches up with her

AULON
Jeanne Are you alright

JEANNE
Yes Yes Im fine
(yelling out)
We need more brushwood
(to Aulon)
Why are you staring at me like that

AULON
Because theres an arrow in your leg

She looks down and there it is poking out her leg an
arrow has penetrated her armor

JEANNE
So there is

She hadnt realized -- and doesnt seem that bothered

JEANNE
but thats no reason for you to
stop You can still climb a ladder
cant you So go on then climb

Aulon looks across at the endless ladders disappearing
into the mist and smoke at the top of the gigantic wall
Jeanne calls out to her page Raymond --

JEANNE
Raymond Over here
Raymond hurries over
JEANNE
Pull it out
Raymond looks terrified --
JEANNE

Pull it out
Raymond grips the arrow while Jeanne gazes across at one
of the ladders laden with Frenchmen As he pulls it out
the ladder falls back plunging the soldiers to their
deaths Jeanne gasps in pain

La Hire and Gilles are further along the bank

GILLES
This is no good

LA HIRE
No good This is a disaster

Gilles stumbles along the bank to Jeanne

GILLES
Jeanne The men are exhausted

JEANNE
I know but so is the enemy --
theyre falling back -- Paris is
ours

GILLES
Jeanne were not enough

JEANNE
So bring up the reinforcements

GILLES

Reinforcements Where

Jeanne waves vaguely behind her --

JEANNE
Right behind us -- Dunois with
another then thousand men

GILLES
Jeanne look behind you

JEANNE
Never look behind -- only ahead

Gilles grips her by the shoulders forcing her to turn and
look behind At most a hundred bedraggled soldiers
limping amid the carnage in the moat Jeanne stares at
them

GILLES
Do you know how to count

JEANNE
Of course I do Bring them up

GILLES
Jeanne that is not ten thousand
reinforcements -- that is one
hundred very loyal but very tired
soldiers

JEANNE
But where is Dunois where are

the men the king promised me

GILLES
He never sent them Dont you
understand He doesnt want this
war anymore he has his crown now

thats all he ever wanted

JEANNE
But my voices they promised me

GILLES
To hell with your voices -- its
time to face facts We have nothing
to do here none of us not even
you You should go home Jeanne

Jeanne stares at them in shock

JEANNE
You dont believe me anymore

LA HIRE
We still believe in you Jeanne If
it were up to me Id chase every
goddamn Englishman into the ocean
But its not up to us anymore --
its up to the king

Jeanne looks at him suddenly furious --

INT CHINON CASTLE - CORRIDORS - DAY

-- Jeanne storms along a corridor her two page boys doing
their best to catch up with her

INT CHINON CASTLE - CHAMBER - DAY

She bursts in on Charles who is cavorting in a bath-tub
with a few frivolous females

CHARLES
Well this is an unexpected
pleasure Ladies let me introduce
you to the celebrated Jeanne

The damsels titter

JEANNE
Get them out of here

CHARLES
Now hold on -- youre not captain
here on the battlefield perhaps
but not in the royal bedchamber

JEANNE
Why did you betray me Paris was
ours for the taking All I needed

was another few hundred men Why
did you take back the army you gave
me

CHARLES

Gave you Well now I wouldnt
quite put it like that

JEANNE
(bluntly)
So how would you put it

CHARLES
Well we are of course
enormously grateful for your past
efforts but your task is done Now
its time for negotiation and
after many months of skillful work
our dear Tremoille is about to seal
a treaty with our Burgundian friends
who will no longer lend their
support to the English You see my
dear Jeanne as it is written in
the Bible to everything there is a
season atime for war and a time
for peace

JEANNE
Peace will only be got from the
English at the end of a lance

CHARLES
Why do you have to be so
bloodthirsty Do you enjoy it All
that blood and noise and pain
Diplomacy is far more civilized
far safer and far cheaper

Jeanne angrily holds out a fistful of letters --

JEANNE
I have letters here from towns under
siege -- Compiegne Provins Melin

-- where the people are starving
begging God on their knees to help

them and Im here to answer their
prayers -- and you want to stop me
France does not belong to you

Charles -- she belongs to God And

if you wont help me save her I
shall do it alone

Jeanne slings the letters in his face and marches out of
the room Charles turns to the girls with a weary sigh

CHARLES
If only she would just go home
INT CORRIDOR - CHINON - DAY

Aulon reaches the door to a chapel to find it guarded by
Louis and Raymond

RAYMOND
You cant go in

AULON
Get out
INT CHAPEL - CHINON - DAY

Aulon enters to find Jeanne crumpled by the altar He
kneels beside her

AULON
Jeanne the king has ordered us
not to ride with you anymore
JEANNE
So what am I supposed to do now

Aulon hesitates

AULON
What do your voices say

Jeanne pauses a long moment whether or not to confide
Finally and with a bleakness not sensed in her before

JEANNE
Theyve abandoned me like
everyone

AULON
What what do you mean

JEANNE
Its been weeks since they spoke to
me Since the coronation no
signs nothing

AULON

Maybe their silence is a sign
Maybe its a sign to go home

JEANNE
Its not time yet My mission is
not over yet There is still more I
must do before I can really --
finally -- go home

AULON
But how do you know that these --
these voices arent really just --
well you

Jeanne stares at him in bemusement -- then suddenly
laughs

JEANNE
Well of course theyre me Thats
how God talks to me If you listen
hard enough even you can hear him
Everyone can hear him

AULON
But I hear so many voices one
voice saying one thing another
voice saying the opposite -- love
your enemy kill your enemy -- what
is good what is evil

JEANNE
All you have to do is stop talking

and just listen

AULON

But how do you know what you hear is

the truth

JEANNE

I dont know it I feel it

AULON

You make it sound so simple

JEANNE

The truth is always simple its
you Jean whos making things

complicated

AULON

Me Its not me its God who
makes everything complicated If
hes all-powerful why not let the
English stay on their island in the
first place And why let this war
go on for a hundred years And why
send you out to fight when a girl
like you should be at home with your

family Why why

JEANNE
So even you dont believe in me
anymore

AULON
Jeanne I believe in you more

than anyone

Aulons hand touches Jeannes hair

He leans forward

though being drawn by her eyes and mouth

AULON

I I just wish I could I want

to to help you

The moment is a little too intense

They gaze at each

other then Jeanne suddenly pulls away

JEANNE

If you really want to help me
theres one thing you can do

Tell me

AULON

JEANNE

Tell the king to give me more men

Jeanne goes leaving Aulon alone deliberating

as

Aulon walks through a small antechamber and is about to
knock at a door when he pauses hearing familiar voices

TREMOILLE (0S)
We have to stop her your majesty
If she raises her own army and
attacks the Burgundians at
Compiegne all my months of painful
negotiations will have been in vain

Aulon draws closer shocked at what he hears

Tremoille is right She behaves as
though she were God Its high time
she found out whos really in
command

INT KINGS CHAMBERS - CHINON - DAY

serpents Charles looks at them all

CHARLES
Its true Theres only one king
people need to be reminded of that
Nevertheless Jeanne has done so
much for us

YOLANDE
I assure you Charles the Maiden
has no greater admirer than myself
But whatever our personal feelings
we cannot allow her to conduct her
own private war For the sake of
the kingdom it is imperative that
you stop her going to Compiegne

CHARLES
I I cant stop her

TREMOILLE
Well if you dont Im sure the
Burgundians will be happy to oblige
If they capture her at Compiegne

REGNAULT

» no one can blame us

CHARLES
I I dont know itll sound
like we betrayed her

TREMOILLE
Noooo

REGNAULT
Good heavens no

TREMOILLE
Never

YOLANDE

Dont worry Charles If God is
still with her she will be
victorious Were not her judges
were just spectators Let her go

fate

Jeanne a little apart from the others with her two page
boys

Jeanne glances at him a moment then nods for Louis and
Raymond to leave

JEANNE
Did the king listen to you

Aulon blushes clears his throat
AULON
Jeanne I I love you Jeanne I
love you and I want to marry you

Jeanne is a little taken aback but is genuinely touched

JEANNE
Thats not what I asked Why do
you want to marry me

AULON
You listen to your voices I listen

to my heart

Jeanne looks at him a beat

JEANNE
What did the king say
AULON
He said that hes making a treaty

with the Duke of Burgundy and

JEANNE
Its a trap Theyre buying time
till they can bring over more
soldiers from England

AULON
Did your voices tell you that You
told me you hadnt heard them for
months

JEANNE
No but

AULON
Or maybe its Jeanne whos in a trap
-- her own trap -- a downward spiral
that she cant stop

JEANNE
Did you come back to marry me or to
insult me

AULON

To marry you
A beat then she looks away

JEANNE
I will ask my voices if they come
back one day Meanwhile Im
going to Compiegne

AULON
Jeanne I have been hearing voices

-- and believe me those voices left
me in no doubt that you must not go
to Compiegne

She looks at him a moment knowing that he speaks the
truth

AULON
Jeanne I believe in you -- but
can you believe in me for once
Dont go even if you dont want
to marry me

JEANNE
I would like to marry you But I
have already promised myself to
God

AULON
But youve done so much for God
as it is cant you do something
for yourself for once -- for Jeanne

JEANNE
But it is what I want

AULON
To be killed in battle

JEANNE
If God wants me to win he will find
away And if he wants me to die

if he wants me back then thats
fine too Then Ill be with him
forever
She has a dreamy faraway look -- one with which Aulon
cannot compete

Will you at least let me stay with
you
JEANNE
It would not be the same without
you

EXT COMPIEGNE - BATTLEFIELD - DAY

SHARP CUT to a Man being felled by a cudgel We are in
the middle of the battle and things are not going well
for the French The citizens and their MAYOR watch
anxiously from the draw-bridge and the town walls Nearby
stands a familiar face the battle-scarred Richmond The
Mayor and Richmond exchange a glance that chills

Jeanne is struggling to keep her banner aloft then a
cry from close by and to her horror she sees Raymond
collapse with an arrow in his breast His faithful
companion Louis races to his side throwing his arms
around him

Jeanne jumps down from her horse but by the time she
reaches him his eyes are closed Louis looks up at her
tears brimming Aulon rides up alongside Jeanne

AULON
We must sound the retreat

JEANNE
Not yet

With the enemy bearing down theres no time to pause

EXT COMPIEGNE - WALLS and POV OF BATTLEFIELD - DAY

From high on the town walls the Mayor surveys the distant
battle Richmond is standing a short distance away He
gives him a sign The Mayor turns to a Guard

MAYOR
I cant risk the towns safety
Raise the drawbridge

EXT COMPIEGNE - BATTLEFIELD - DAY

As Jeanne rides back with Aulon she spots Richmond beyond
the drawbridge inside the town Theres a brief exchange
between them a locking of eyes Jeanne turns to Aulon

JEANNE
Get back inside the town and see if
the English are attacking from the
other side

AULON
But why whats the point

JEANNE
Do as I say

AULON
I want to stay with you

JEANNE
Thats an order

Aulon looks almost shocked He backs away then turns his
horse about and rides back across the drawbridge and into
the town Seconds later the drawbridge begins to rise
and Jeanne is trapped

She tries to fight her way clear of the advancing English
but they encircle her She lashes out with the flat of
her sword trying to keep their swords and lances at bay
The noose tightens -- her horse starts to panic but
strangely theres a smile on her face as though she sees
the end coming this end that she so desires to die ona
battlefield in penance for the blood shed in her name

Suddenly a BOLT slices through BONE --

-- and Jeannes horse collapses from under her She rolls
to the ground springing back to her feet as the English
close in Again she flays the air with her sword but it
becomes heavier and heavier as her energy finally begins
to drain

A huge iron ball smashes her sword in two -- now she has
no weapon but her fists Yet still she lashes out like
a fox cornered by hounds Another blow -- she falls to

the ground her face gazing up Her eyes soften and
again that smile --

Her POV High above the dust and smoke and flame of
battle -- a little patch of blue
EXT FIELD - SUMMER - DAY

and Jeanne falls into the field of her childhood

JEANNE
My Lord
-- the sky brightens -- the SUN dazzles -- spacetime
dilates with her arms wide open Jeanne offers herself
to the skies --
JEANNE
Take me

Nature starts to consume her integrating her as a part of
the whole clouds seasons and wind become one in an

apocalyptic ballet grass flowers and roots consume
her the camera suddenly pulls back so fast and far that
within seconds the earth has become a revolving sphere in
the darkness of space

FLASH the sphere now becomes a four-dimensional torus a
fluid dynamic ring evolving in and out of space

FLASH the torus blinks and the dark center becomes a
BLUE EYE the same diameter as Jeannes overwhelmed by
this vision A shadow of a MAN clutching a mace is
reflected in the blueness

SHARP CUT to the Man as he slams her WHAM
BLACK Then a zillion stars evolve from the darkness

slowly rotating inversely toward a central point as though
returning to the origin of spacetime in one single

dimensionless point of light -- which then suddenly
EXPLODES

At the same moment a HUGE EYE blinks open -- the EYE of
Jeanne

INT COMPIEGNE - PRISON - NIGHT

Jeannes eyes search a darkness that gradually resolves
into the grim dank confines of a dungeon She sits bolt
upright as though awakening from a nightmare

She is on a wooden bed her face bruised and tumefied A
few inches away is a MAN one side of his shaved head
catching a sliver of light Hes laughing at her

MAN
I cant believe it your romantic
vision of death with all that grass
growing everywhere I must admit

you have a great imagination Or
maybe not great enough Death is
much more simple

FLASH A dead body lying in the silent forest a trickle
of blood running from his mouth

MAN
after a few months it gets more
interesting

FLASH Same shot only now the body is wriggling
FLASH The body is now reduced to skin and bones
MAN

then -- after a year -- it
finally becomes romantic

FLASH The same spot in the forest but now there is no
sign of the body

Jeanne shakes her head

JEANNE
Who who are you

MAN
I am that I am
(beat)
You dont like my face
(evidently not)
Maybe you prefer this one

His face melts into the little boy sitting on a throne in
the middle of the wood She gazes at him in
bewilderment --

MAN
Too young maybe How about this one

The boy becomes the young man she saw in the forest
Jeanne is breathless The Man is invading her most secret
memories

MAN
Better no But incomplete

Suddenly his face is flooded with blood like the image of
the man she saw during the battle of Orleans

Jeanne SCREAMS covering her face

JEANNE
Get thee behind me Satan

The Man smiles unaffected by her outburst

MAN
Who are you to even think you can
know the difference between good and
evil Are you God

JEANNE
No no Im just a messenger
He needs me a higher calling
Suddenly the man starts to bellow -- the walls tremble --
the bellow becomes a roar clouds boil behind his
head
MAN

HOW CAN YOU BEGIN TO IMAGINE THAT
GOD THE CREATOR OF HEAVEN AND
EARTH THE SOURCE OF ALL LIFE COULD

POSSIBLY NEED -- YOU
Jeanne can no longer stop her tears

JEANNE
I dont know I thought

MAN
YOU THINK GOD ISNT BIG ENOUGH TO
DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES

JEANNE
I dont know please tell me
Im dead

MAN
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD
LIVE OR DIE

JEANNE
I dont know what do you want
from me

MAN
Nothing Im here to set you
free

The Man holds up his hand as though in judgment --
A hand slams across her face --

-- and she wakes up nursing her hot cheek In front of
her the rough English guard who just struck her

GUARD
(angrily)
I said smile You have visitors

The door opens and a smart delegation arrives in her
cell led by a thin reed of a man the Duke of BURGUNDY
and his right-arm DIJON

GUARD
His Grace the Duke of Burgundy

Jeanne stares at him confused

BURGUNDY
So here is the famous Jeanne
Savior of Orleans terror of the
English You look pretty ordinary
to me

JEANNE
Am I am I dead

BURGUNDY

Dead youre worthless darling

JEANNE
Where where am I
BURGUNDY
Guess
She looks about her dismal confines
JEANNE

My king will pay any ransom you ask

BURGUNDY
Your king Ah yes of course
Whats he going to pay me with
Cows Chickens I prefer gold and
the English have plenty I wonder
how much theyll pay to have the
Witch of Orleans in their clutches
Those English are so arrogant they
cant accept the idea of being
defeated by a peasant girl it has
to have been the devils work

JEANNE
God defeated the English not me

BURGUNDY
And God who allowed you to be
caught

Jeanne hadnt thought about that before

BURGUNDY
Personally I dont believe in God
and I dont believe in the Devil
either Thats why Im never
disappointed

Aulon goes to see the King in his chamber and hands him a
heavy sack Tremoille and Regnault are present as
always

AULON
Here to help pay Jeannes ransom
All the Captains gave what they
could as well as the citizens of
Orleans and the other towns she
saved

CHARLES
Very generous of you all How much

AULON
10000 gold crowns

From their expressions this is clearly an enormous
amount

CHARLES
10000 thats a lot but I fear
not enough But it will be my
pleasure to make up the difference
(to Archbishop

Regnault)
Your Grace I place you in charge
of this sensitive negotiation

INT OFFICE - DUKE OF BURGUNDYS CASTLE - DAY
Burgundys right-arm -- DIJON -- turns to his Assistant

DIJON
They send a Bishop to negotiate
Thats a good sign Let him in

It is not Archbishop Regnault who enters but another
ecclesiastic swaddled in the rich robes of his office
the Bishop of Beauvais one Pierre CAUCHON

CAUCHON
Good day sir I trust my honorable
Duke of Burgundy is feeling well

DIJON
Hes feeling wonderful

CAUCHON
Thanks be to God

DIJON

And your Duke The Duke of Bedford

CAUCHON
Not so well I regret to say This
business with the Maiden its

caused him endless grief and
torment Thats why hes entrusted
me with the task of shall we
say

DIJON
Buying her

CAUCHON
This word is -- regrettably
appropriate for the situation In
fact what we -- the Church -- wish
to do is determine whether or not
this girl is sent by God as she
claims You understand that we
cannot allow just anybody to abuse
Gods name in this manner

DIJON
I understand How much

It is that other man of the cloth Regnault who answers

REGNAULT
5000 gold crowns

DIJON
Thats not a lot

REGNAULT

It is all his majesty can afford

He has even donated his very own
personal savings His majesty will
greatly appreciate a gesture of good
will in this delicate negotiation
between our two families

DIJON
I know but the English want her
very badly and I have to tell you
that they are proving much more
generous

REGNAULT
May I without offending you

inquire how generous

DIJON
20000 gold crowns

Regnaults rival cleric Cauchon looks aghast

CAUCHON
20000 But I heard King
Charles was financially
embarrassed

DIJON

Dont look at the cost look at what
it brings What is your last offer

REGNAULT
8000 We cant raise more We
can only place ourselves at the
mercy of your generosity

DIJON
I must offer to the Duke I will
give you his answer tomorrow

INT PRISON CELL - BEAUREVOIR - DAY
A Burgundian Soldier shakes Jeanne to wake her up

SOLDIER
Hey wake up get yourself
ready youre leaving

Jeanne opens her eyes as Cauchon enters her cell dressed
in ecclesiastical robes He stands in front of her
flanked by two monks At the sigh of the churchmen she
brightens

JEANNE
Oh thank you Lord
(to Cauchon)
Im so glad to see you I need to
confess I havent been confessed
since Easter or been to Mass
Will you hear me now

CAUCHON
I will hear you but not now not
here

JEANNE
Who are you

CAUCHON

Pierre Cauchon Bishop of Beauvais
As you were captured in my diocese
the duty of conducting the trial
falls upon me

JEANNE
Trial What trial

CAUCHON
Your trial Jeanne On a charge of
heresy

JEANNE
But the King -- my king -- didnt
he pay my ransom

CAUCHON

It seems that the English care more
about you than the French

JEANNE
The English

CAUCHON
Yes They paid your ransom

tomorrow you will be transferred to
their great castle at Rouen

The door slams shut and she is left alone Jeanne is
utterly distraught She looks round the bleak cell

moves over to a small window

to squeeze through

EXT

Jeanne clambers out onto a narrow ledge

frozen moat below Only a fool -- or one bent on suicide

LEDGE - BEAUREVOIR - NIGHT

-- would hazard such a leap

VOICE (0OS)
Need some help

then

just wide enough for her

high above the

The Man we saw after Compiegne is once again behind her

JEANNE
What are you doing out here

MAN
I might ask you the same question

JEANNE
I Im leaving I cant take
anymore

MAN

And what exactly is it that you
cant take anymore of

JEANNE
Everything Prison -- humiliation
-- being abandoned and betrayed by
everyone -- I cant stand it anymore
-- Id rather die

MAN
Youll be dead soon enough anyway
so why be in such a hurry Why not
face up to your lies Its your
lies you cant stand anymore

JEANNE
I I never lied
MAN
If you were true to yourself if

your faith was firm you wouldnt
need to run away from yourself like
this

JEANNE
I am true -- to my Lord the King of

Jeanne is lost

Heaven He knows how much I love
him -- thats all that matters to
me

MAN

How can you pretend that you love
God when youre about to throw away
the most precious thing he gave you
Life is a gift you should know that
by now Jeanne -- a gift from God
You know what Hed say to you if He
was here What are you doing to
me Jeanne

exhausted numbed She gazes into the

void contemplating the fall

The Man suddenly pushes her so that she nearly falls

JEANNE
Youre right I shouldnt do that

MAN

Thats too easy One minute you
want to die the next you want to
live

(again pushes her)
Do you think that life is a toy that
can be played with and then broken
when you dont want it anymore

He pushes her again

JEANNE
No no Im just so tired and
lost and I didnt realize what I
was doing

MAN

Oh And just because you realize
now everybody else should forgive
you

JEANNE
I dont know -- I dont care anymore
-- I just want to be at peace

MAN
Oh so you dont want war anymore
You want to be at peace You want
to be able to change your mind
anytime you feel like it and expect
everyone to go along with it

JEANNE
I dont understand What do you
want from me

MAN
I told you already Im here to
set you free

Again the Man pushes her This time she loses her
balance and with a startled cry falls from the ledge --
plunging down down -- and crashing into the frozen
moat

Two castle GUARDS on watch are alerted by the SOUND of
splintering ice

Jeanne is drowning barely able to cling to the broken ice
around her The first Guard to reach the moat tests the

surface with his foot

GUARD 2
Dont try -- youll fall through

The First Guard lies flat to spread his weight then
crawls toward Jeanne

GUARD 1
Good God its the prisoner

The Second Guard glances up at the tower ledge far
above

GUARD 2
If she jumped from up there shes
dead for sure forget it
The First Guard reaches the edge of the hole just as
Jeanne disappears beneath the water He plunges in his
hand and grabs her hair pulling her head back above the
water

INT CORRIDOR - CHINON CASTLE - DAWN

Aulon races along castle corridors until he reaches a
door guarded by two burly Guards

GUARD
The king is occupied

AULON
Out of my way

INT THRONE ROOM - CHINON CASTLE - DAY

Aulon bursts into the room to find Charles Regnault and
Tremoille in conversation

CHARLES

Charles shivers

My dear Aulon
(dismissing Guards
Thats fine

AULON
Jeannes been badly injured She
jumped from the top of a tower into
a frozen moat

at the thought

CHARLES
Its a miracle shes not dead

AULON
We have to do something before she
tries it again I beg of you my
lord dont let her down let me
organize an escape

CHARLES
Jean its its not so easy
AULON
But not impossible Gilles and La

Hire are ready to risk everything to
save her

CHARLES
Jean me dear loyal Jean why
do you want to oppose the will of
God Jeanne wanted to go to
Compiegne -- we let her -- she got
caught Then on my personal
orders Regnault proposed 30000
crowns for her ransom and once
again the answer was no And now
you say she tried to escape and the
answer is still no Jean open your
eyes -- cant you see the hand of
God in all this

AULON
No I see the hand of Tremoille
and Regnault and Yolande and
you and they are dirty hands

REGNAULT
How can you speak such treachery
when his majesty has done everything
to try and save her

AULON
Because I was at this door when you
planned to betray her and I was

at Compiegne when she was betrayed

Charles Tremoille and Regnault are speechless Tremoille
breaks the silence --

TREMOILLE
Guards Arrest this traitor

The Two Guards turn on Aulon who readily dispatches them
with his sword Tremoille hides behind Charles just as
Aulon pins the King with the tip of his sword against his
windpipe It would now be an easy matter for Tremoille to
push Charles onto the tip of Aulons sword

AULON
What do you fear most now my
sword
(eyeing Tremoille)
» or his hands

CHARLES
Tremoille dont Please

Tremoille hesitates a beat Still holding the tip of his
sword at Charles throat Aulon motions to Tremoille

AULON
My sword is long enough for both of
you

Sweating now Tremoille eases himself from behind the
Kings back Charles exhales with relief

AULON

I have always been loyal and true to
you but my allegiance is now at an
end From now on my loyalty
belongs to Jeanne

and Aulon runs from the room leaving Charles
Tremoille and Regnault in a state of shock

EXT CHINON CASTLE - DAY

Aulon gallops away from the castle

EXT ROUEN CASTLE - DUSK

The great castle of Rouen vast and bleak silhouetted
against the dusk

INT ROUEN CASTLE - CORRIDOR - DUSK

A Guard leads a group of wealthy-looking visitors along a
dank dark corridor

GUARD
» so dont say I didnt warn you
Dont touch her whatever you do --
dont even stretch out your hand or
shell have one of your fingers off
sooner than spit at you

WOMAN 1
As savage as that is she

GUARD
Savage Shes a monster At
Orleans they say she drank her
victims blood

WOMAN 2
Oh its too horrible

The womans escort takes advantage of the situation

MALE
Dont worry my sweet -- Ill have
my sword at the ready

They reach the door and the Guard fumbles for the right
key The Duke of Bedford brings up the rear escorting
his wife Anne who is visibly pregnant

DUCHESS
Dont you think this visit is a
little inappropriate

BEDFORD
My dear its our duty shes our

guest
The Guard unlocks the door and the Group cautiously
enter
INT JEANNES CELL - ROUEN CASTLE - NIGHT
The visitors glance about but the cell appears empty --

until they look up An iron cage is hanging from the
middle of the ceiling In the center of the cage is a

body dressed in rags and curled up like a wounded animal

BEDFORD
Wake her up so we can see her face

The Guard takes his cudgel and pokes her through the bars

GUARD
Hey wake up we got noble guests
-- dont disappoint them -- turn

round

He prods her in
pain Her face
full of grief

The Guard looks
husband

the ribs and she turns to avoid further
is swollen her mouth parched her eyes
The Duchess is stunned

GUARD
Now shes sleepy but you wait and
see -- any moment now and shell

start speaking to her devils and
then shell get to yelping like a
wolf in heat The other night she
made her cage spin round so fast we
thought she was going to fly away

WOMAN
Oooo she gives me creeps

GUARD
Do you want her to stand up so you
can get a better look

DUCHESS
No But get her out of this cage
and give her a decent bed

stunned The Duchess turns to her

DUCHESS
Im sorry but this child is being
treated like an animal Dont you
think that whatever her crimes may
be she deserves a little more of
our charity

Shes not a child my dear -- shes

a witch

Cauchon enters a large gloomy courtroom and sits down

surrounded by c
other churchmen

The door opens

lerics assessors doctors of theology and

CAUCHON
Let the prisoner be brought in

and Jeanne is led in her wrists and ankles

fettered her face pale and drawn She stands in the
center of the room isolated alone A scribe dips his

quill in the ink and prepares to write on a blank sheet of

parchment

CAUCHON
Our most serene and Christian King

Henry the Sixth King of England and
France has handed this girl over to
us accused of a number of heretical
deeds to be tried in a matter of
faith

Jeanne is hustled closer to Cauchon who leans forward
peering at her intently

CAUCHON
Take the Holy Gospels in your hand
and swear to tell the whole truth
concerning everything you will be
asked

JEANNE
I dont know what youre going to
ask me questions about You may ask
things that I wont want to answer

Jeannes boldness takes everyone somewhat by surprise

CAUCHON
You will swear to tell the truth
about whatever you are asked

JEANNE
I will willingly swear to tell the
truth about earthly things but as
for my revelations Ive never told

anyone except my king Charles the
Seventh the one and only king of
France

There is murmured dissension among the judges We now see
that the Duke of Bedford is also in the room together
with a small coterie of English observers Cauchon is
impatient

CAUCHON
You must take the oath Not even a
king would refuse to take an oath
to tell the truth in a matter of
faith

JEANNE
I will willingly swear to tell you
what I am allowed to tell you but
as to the rest even if you threaten
to cut off my head I still wont
tell you

Cauchon looks confused -- and aware that his authority is
slipping The judges and theologians are getting
agitated

CAUCHON

So begin by telling us your name
-- assuming youre allowed to tell
us that much

JEANNE
My name is Jeanne My little cross
I had round my neck was taken away
from me I would like to have it
back

The Duchess touches the gold cross she has around her
neck

CAUCHON
Show us a little more cooperation
first Where were you born

JEANNE
In a village called Domremy

CAUCHON
How old are you

CAUCHON
Nineteen or thereabouts

CAUCHON
Were you baptized

JEANNE

Yes In the church at Domremy

CAUCHON
Recite the Lords Prayer

JEANNE
Not unless you hear my confession

Cauchon is getting impatient

CAUCHON
Jeanne listen to me very carefully
We are all men of faith and we
all earnestly strive for the
alvation of both your soul and body
s though it were our own We do so
n the name of our Holy Mother
urch who never closes her arms to
ose who would return to her But
e cannot help you unless you submit
o our learned judgment and
uthority Take heed of this
aritable admonition for if you
persist in refusing our help then
we shall have no choice but to
abandon you to the secular powers
and I think you know well enough the

QearetQroa nD

punishment that would await you So
now will you please recite Our
Lords Prayer

JEANNE
Not unless you hear my confession

The clerks and judges grow agitated though we sense a few
are already beginning to warm to her not least the
Duchess

CAUCHON
Jeanne -- be careful -- youre not
helping yourself by refusing to
submit to our judgment

JEANNE
And you be careful you who claim to
be my judges for you too will be
judged one day

The court explodes in protest with cries of Blasphemy

Shes possessed An infected limb Sorceress
Cauchon hammers on the table to restore order calling
out --

CAUCHON

Guards Take the prisoner away
Clear the room

Armed Guards hustle the clerics from the room while Jeanne
is led away watched by the Duke and Duchess of Bedford

Bedford turns to his aide (Buck) --

BEDFORD
I count on you to have it done

BUCK
Uh to have what done

BEDFORD
I want her burned

BUCK

As you say sir

INT ANTECHAMBER - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

The assessors look extremely uncomfortable not least
Pierre Cauchon who does his best to conceal it

CAUCHON
Well in the future I think we
should conduct our enquiries in
private -- away from public pressure

-- so we can all be more level-
headed

ASSESSOR 1
I think the church should wash its
hands of this whole business

ASSESSOR 2
Let the English burn her if they
want to why does it have to
involve us

Buck enters the room as an old Priest walks over

The Old Priest

The Old Priest

CAUCHON

Because its its our clear duty
to root out heresy wherever it
occurs

(to the Old Priest)
Father Vincente you are the most
venerable among us what do you
think

OLD PRIEST
I think this trial is a masquerade
and I wont be part of it anymore
I am willing to be her judge but
not her executioner This young
girl seems courageous and pious
she deserves to be well judged

walks toward the door

CAUCHON
Thats what Im trying to ensure

OLD PRIEST
The verdict comes at the end of a
trial Cauchon not at the
beginning I am going back to Rome
to give me report to our Holy Father
the Pope

CAUCHON
This is ridiculous Now Im the one

whos on trial and being judged

OLD PRIEST
Yes exactly as Jeanne predicted

heads for the door followed by the other

two Buck calls out to the Guards

BUCK
Arrest them

CAUCHON

What are you doing This is an
ecclesiastical court -- you have no
right to do this

BUCK
Rouen is in English territory I
have the right to do anything I
like
(to guards)
Take them away

Ignoring their protestations the Guards hustle them away
leaving the others in a state of high anxiety

INT CELL - ROUEN CASTLE - NIGHT

Jeanne is in her cell facing the wall and frantically
scratching it with her nails She is engraving a cross
and her nails are covered with blood

She is now kneeling in front of her cross racing through
The Lords Prayer as though on the run from the Devil

JEANNE
Our father who is in heaven hallowed
be thy name thy kingdom come in
earth as it is in heaven forgive
them that lead forgive us that
lead them as we forgive them
that oh God dont cut yourself
off from me like this I dont
know what Im meant to say or not
say anymore I dont even know
what to think oh God Im so
lost dont abandon me like
everyone else please I beg of
you at least say you can hear
me Tell me you hear me Why
wont you answer me Please I beg
of you -- ANSWER ME

Suddenly the Man comes out of the wall kneeling in
front of her and violently hitting his forehead against
hers --

MAN
Why were you yelling like that

JEANNE
What are you doing here
(urgently)
Please leave you cant stay
here
MAN

Why Are you waiting for someone

else

JEANNE
Yes

MAN
Who

Jeanne hesitates

JEANNE
My visions

MAN
Theyre going to come and visit you
in here

JEANNE
Yes thats what I pray for

MAN
I want to see that Do you mind if
I stay on the side I wont
bother you

JEANNE
No no -- you cant stay or they
wont come

MAN
Why not

JEANNE
Because I have to be alone

He smiles regretfully
MAN

They wont come anyway

JEANNE
What do you mean they wont come

MAN
Why would they

JEANNE
Because Because Ive always been
faithful to God and Ive followed
everything he said and Ive done
everything he asked me

MAN
God asked you to do something

JEANNE
Yes lots of things

MAN
You mean God said I need you

Jeanne

JEANNE
No but he sent me so many signs

MAN
What signs

JEANNE
Like like the wind and the
clouds and the bells and
what about that sword lying in the
field that was a sign

MAN

No That was a sword in a field

JEANNE
But it didnt just get there by
itself

MAN
True -- every event has an infinite
number of causes -- but why pick one
rather than another There are many
ways a sword might find itself ina
field

FLASH A group of soldiers on horseback trot across the
field of Jeannes childhood The last soldiers sword is
coming loose and ends up falling into the long grass

MAN
Seems a perfectly valid
explanation but how about this
one

FLASH Two young children are hurrying with the sword
when an old man calls them from far away --

OLD MAN
Hey you little devils -- come back

The two children drop the sword in the long grass (in the
same spot as before) and run off

MAN
But then again there are other
possibilities

FLASH A man is being chased across the field by a couple

of English soldiers out looting His heavy sword is
slowing him down -- he flings it into the long grass

MAN
or even faster

FLASH The same man running across the field is suddenly
hit by an arrow from nowhere He drops the sword in the
long grass but manages to stagger off into the forest

MAN
» and thats without counting the
inexplicable

FLASH A man crosses the field For no apparent reason
whatsoever he drops the sword and keeps on walking

MAN
Yet from an infinite number of
possibilities you had to pick this

one
FLASH A peel of thunder -- clouds swirl -- a familiar
wind stirs the long grass -- a fabulous shaft of light

illuminates the patch -- the sword slowly descends from

the heavens and lands gently in the grass Mission
accomplished the shaft of heavenly light disappears

Jeanne is bewildered

MAN
You didnt see what was Jeanne
You saw what you wanted to see

speechless

INT SMALL COURTROOM - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

We are now in a smaller more intimate courtroom The
Duchess of Bedford is at the back shielded behind the
theologians and doctors of the church Beaupere is
questioning Jeanne a cooler man than Cauchon

BEAUPERE
This voice that you say appears
to you is it an angel Ora

saint Or does it come from God
Jeanne is still in shock from her encounter with the Man

JEANNE
I wont tell you more about that
Im more afraid of displeasing Him
than not answering you

BEAUPERE
Youre afraid of displeasing God
when telling the truth

JEANNE

No

BEAUPERE
Did God forbid you to tell the
truth

JEANNE

No But my revelations were for the
King of France not for you

DESTIVET
When you saw your king for the first
time was there an angel over his
head

JEANNE
If there was I didnt see it

DESTIVET
Then why did your king believe in
you without any proof

JEANNE
Go and ask him yourself

CAUCHON
Jeanne you are not helping
yourself If you dont answer our
questions properly your refusal
will be taken into account

JEANNE
These questions have nothing to do
with your trial

CAUCHON
I assure you they do So answer
me when was the last time you
heard this voice

JEANNE
Not long ago

CAUCHON
When exactly A day a week --
when

JEANNE
Last night

This takes the assessors by surprise Cauchon leans
forward

CAUCHON

What were you doing when the voice
came

JEANNE
Praying

CAUCHON
The voice was in your cell

JEANNE
Yes

CAUCHON
What did it tell you

JEANNE
Many things

CAUCHON

Did it give you advice
(Jeanne hesitates)
Good advice

Jeanne hesitates

JEANNE
Go onto the next question

BEAUPERE
Good advice for the French not for
the English Do you think God hates
the English

JEANNE
I dont know but youre all men of
the church why not ask Him
yourself
Cauchon tries to continue but another theologian -- JEAN
MIDI -- gets in first
JEAN MIDI

Do you consider yourself to be ina
state of grace

Jeanne looks perplexed a beat

JEANNE
Go on to the next question

Cauchon seizes his opportunity

CAUCHON
Tell us Jeanne do you often hear
this voice

JEANNE

Yes

CAUCHON
Is it here Now In this room

Jeanne slowly looks at the assessors staring at each in
turn They all look acutely uneasy holding there
breath

JEANNE
No

Relief from the assessors but Buck is far from happy

INT ANTECHAMBER - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY
Buck paces in front of Cauchon and a dozen clerics

BUCK
Whos running this trial you or
her I cant believe it This
wretched girl -- how dare she speak
to us like that

CAUCHON
Shes loyal to her king its only
to be expected that she

Buck explodes with fury --

BUCK
There is only one king of France and
thats our liege Lord Henry the
Sixth It is written in black and
white in the Treaty of Troyes --
that you French bastards signed

Buck presses a digit against Cauchons sweaty forehead

CAUCHON
I understand your impatience but if
you want this trial to be
acknowledged as legal we must follow
correct procedure and

BUCK
To hell with procedure We paid a
bloody fortune for this slut and we
can do whatever the hell we like
with her whether the church likes
it or not -- is that clear

CAUCHON
But if this trial seems fixed I
fear youll have the very opposite
result to the one you want

BUCK

We want her burned as a witch

CAUCHON
But in order to do so the church
must first prove her heresy or else
youll be burning a martyr

BUCK
Well then Start proving or else

the church will have another martyr

Buck storms out slamming the door behind him

INT SMALL COURTROOM - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

Instruments of torture are brought into court by the
Executioner who lays them out with due ceremony

DESTIVET
You told us about the appearance of
this voice What exactly did you
see Part of it or all of it

JEANNE
His face

DESTIVET
Does he have hair

JEANNE
Yes

DESTIVET

Is it long and hanging down

JEANNE
Im more interested in what he says
not what he looks like

DESTIVET
But if the devil were to take on the
physical appearance of a saint or an
angel or a man how would you
recognize him By what he said

JEANNE
Go on to the next question

DESTIVET
Thats enough You will answer the
question or face the
consequences

A beat the Executioner readies

JEANNE

If you were to tear me limb from
limb and make my soul leave my body
I would tell you nothing more And
if I did say anything then
afterward I would simply say that
you dragged it out of me by force
Now please go onto the next
question

INT SMALL COURTROOM - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY
CUT TO another session

JEAN LE MAISTRE
Who told you to wear mens clothes

JEANNE
The clothes are not important

JEAN LE MAISTRE
You also cut your hair short like a
man and in the Bible it clearly
states that it is an abomination for
a woman to pretend to be a man It
proves your desire to deceive

JEANNE
It was just more convenient as I
was among soldiers

JEAN LE MAISTRE
So you think you did well to cut
your hair and dress as a man

JEANNE
I submit to Our Lord

JEAN LE MAISTRE
But will you also submit to the
decision of the Church

JEANNE
It seems to me that the Church and
Our Lord are one and the same Why
must you complicate what is so
simple

Jean Le Maistre looks at Cauchon for help

CAUCHON
Let me clarify things for you
Jeanne On the one hand there is
the Church Triumphant that is to
say God his saints and the souls
that are saved And then there is
the Church Militant that is to say

our Holy Father the Pope the
cardinals the prelates of the
Church the clergy and all good
Catholic Christians Moreover this
Church when assembled is guided by
the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot
be in error That is why we ask you
to submit to the Church Militant
that is to say us

JEANNE
So it is the Church Militant that
refuses to confess me and so
prevents me from being a good
Christian

Cauchon bridles his temper

CAUCHON
It is for us to determine whether
you are a good Christian not you

JEANNE
I am sent by God and I submit all
my words and deeds to His judgment
Or do you think that you are better
judges than He is

INT SMALL COURTROOM - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY
and another session
MAITRE MAURICE
When you were taken prisoner at
Compiegne did you have a horse

JEANNE
Yes a half-steed white

MAITRE MAURICE
Who gave you that horse

JEANNE
My king

MAITRE MAURICE
How many did he give you

JEANNE
Five steeds and a few hackneys

MAITRE MAURICE
As much as for a Lord What an
honor Did your king give you other
wealth apart from horses

JEANNE
No

MAITRE MAURICE
What about all those dresses you
were given silk dresses werent
they

JEANNE
Yes I was given a few but I never
had time to wear them

MAITRE MAURICE
Still pretty wealthy for a peasant
girl wouldnt you say

JEANNE
And you look pretty wealthy for a
servant of God wouldnt you say

Maitre Maurice looks uncomfortably about him Shes

right

BEAUPERE
Is it true that you launched an
attack on Paris

JEANNE
I tried to

BEAUPERE
It was on a Sunday wasnt it

JEANNE
I dont remember Maybe

BEAUPERE
Do you think is was a good idea to
launch an attack on a holy day

JEANNE
I dont know

BEAUPERE
And didnt you order the citizens of
Paris to surrender the city in the
name of the King of Heaven

JEANNE
No I said Surrender in the name
of the King of France

BEAUPERE
That is not what is written in the
evidence look for yourself

Beaupere thrusts a document in her face

Beaupere is exasperated

up

JEANNE
I cant read

BEAUPERE
Ah yes I forgot God sent us an
illiterate peasant to carry out such
an important mission Do you think
that God made the right decision to
take an ignorant girl to save the
kingdom of France

JEANNE
I leave the answer to God

JEAN MIDI
Tell us Jeanne why did you jump
from the tower at Beaurevoir

JEANNE
I had been sold to the English Id
rather die than fall into their
hands

JEAN MIDI
Did your voice tell you to jump

JEANNE
No

JEAN MIDI
So when you jumped you wanted to
kill yourself

JEANNE
No

JEAN MIDI
How can you deny it when you just
said Id rather die than fall into
the hands of the English

JEANNE
Thats now what I meant

JEAN MIDI
Do you not know that suicide is a
very grievous sin No one is
allowed to destroy the life that God
created

JEANNE
I know but thats not the way
things happened

A sly-looking Theologian speaks

JEAN MIDI
You mean it was not of your own free
will that you were on the ledge

JEANNE
Yes but

JEAN MIDI
And you didnt jump of your free
will

JEANNE
No

JEAN MIDI

(making fun of her)
Oh Perhaps someone pushed you
then

They laugh Jeanne lowers her head

INT SMALL COURTROOM - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

Yet another weary session

BEAUPERE
Do you have a sword

JEANNE
Quite a few

BEAUPERE

Didnt you also carry a banner

JEANNE
Yes

BEAUPERE
Which did you prefer your banner or
your sword

JEANNE
I was forty times more fond of my
banner than my sword

BEAUPERE
And why was that Did it have some
particular value or power

JEANNE
No its just a sword is a
weapon

BEAUPERE
And

JEANNE

And so I I prefer my banner
BEAUPERE
Why
JEANNE

To avoid killing anyone

BEAUPERE
Are you saying that if you had not
been carrying your banner youd have
killed more people

Jeanne is losing her confidence

JEANNE
No of course not I never killed
anyone

BEAUPERE
Then perhaps the temptation to kill
would have been stronger too
strong perhaps

JEANNE
No I warned the English to go back
home -- I begged them not to force
us to fight -- they knew the defeat
I would bring on them why didnt
they listen to me

BEAUPERE
We have numerous witnesses who can
confirm that you were not always
carrying your banner

JEANNE
Yes probably maybe

BEAUPERE
So sometimes you were carrying just
your sword

JEANNE
Yes but

BEAUPERE
Did you use the sword that you held

in your hand

JEANNE
No I I held it up to

BEAUPERE
You held up your sword and

flourished it about in the air
Like this

JEANNE
Yes maybe I dont remember

BEAUPERE
SO you were in the middle of the
battlefield with your sword in your
hand waving it above your head
charging against the enemy
screaming and yelling fighting
for your life and you want us to
believe that in the middle of all
this excitement you never killed

anyone
JEANNE
No I I never killed anyone
MAN (0OS)
I cant believe you can lie like
that

INT JEANNES CELL - ROUEN CASTLE - NIGHT

Jeannes fetter is once again attached to her chain and
shes walking in circles trying to escape the Man

JEANNE
Im not lying I I cant
remember leave me alone

MAN

Oh You cant remember Let me
help your memory

FLASH an Englishman is skewed during the battle of
Orleans

JEANNE
No I dont want to know anymore
Leave me alone I didnt kill that

man

MAN
Oh no How about this one

FLASH another English soldier is killed

MAN
Or this one

FLASH and another

JEANNE

FLASH

Stop stop I cant remember The
battles were all so confusing
there was so much smoke dust
noise I was being attacked on all
sides so maybe perhaps I
fought back but it was only to
defend myself

MAN
So your memorys coming back

JEANNE
Yes yes And now you tell me
why God let all these battles happen
in the first place if hes so
powerful he said hes the
creator of heaven and earth the
source of all life he could have

easily stopped all this blood and
misery Why didnt he

MAN
Is he the one who spread all this
blood and misery

JEANNE
No but why didnt he stop it
Or did he get pleasure watching us
killing each other in his name

MAN
In His name

JEANNE
Yes We fought and killed in His
name the King of Heaven

MAN

Really

Jeanne is seated in her saddle before Orleans

raising her standard with the cry --

JEANNE
Let all who love me follow me

Back in Jeannes cell

MAN
Let all who love me follow me
Where does God get mentioned
(Jeanne is cornered)
Come on Jeanne be honest You
fought for yourself in your name

JEANNE
I I was defending myself as best

FLASHBACK

I could Everyone has the right to
defend themselves dont they Or
should I have let myself be killed

MAN
No no you did fine Id even say
well done Besides most of the
ones you killed probably deserved
it dont you think

JEANNE
No I do not think so I dont
think that killing each other will
ever bring peace

MAN
I agree

Jeanne telling Charles --

JEANNE
Peace will only be got from the
English at the end of a lance

The Man looks at Jeanne who is becoming unnerved

FLASH
a look

Jeanne

MAN
I dont agree Why do you have to
keep changing your mind all the
time

JEANNE
Why are you doing this to me Do
you get pleasure from hurting me

MAN
Ah pleasure thats a difficult
word to define When does the pain
end and the pleasure begin
When did your pleasure begin with
that sword in your hand

JEANNE
I never took pleasure in hurting
anyone

MAN
Really

In EXTREME SLOW MOTION Jeannes face contorts --
of madness as she sweeps a sword across the
SCREEN

JEANNE
Nnnnoooocococo

covers her face with her hands sobbing in despair

JEANNE
Help me please set me free

The Man seems genuinely compassionate

MAN
You will be Jeanne You will be

INT HALLWAY - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

A hooded Priest moves along the hallway stopping in front
of the Guard He shows him his pass -- a heavy seal
The Priest is Aulon in disguise The Guard looks at the
seal

AULON
Im replacing Father Demaury Hes
become very sick

GUARD
Its amazing how many people have
become suddenly very sick since the
beginning of this trial it must
be this witch casting spells on
them Burn her

No doubt Aulon would like to stab the Guard right there
but thinks better of it

AULON
Ill do my best

Aulon enters the court room

INT COURTROOM - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

-- and sits on a bench doing his best to look
inconspicuous He guardedly glances at Jeanne who seems
to be asleep on her feet Beaupere is whispering to
Cauchon document in hand Beaupere beckons to the
Guard

BEAUPERE
Wake her up

The Guard pokes Jeanne in the ribs She seems almost used
to this kind of treatment but is weaker Aulon seethes
with impotent rage hidden behind his hood

JEAN MIDI
So let us summarize your
situation You refuse to submit to
the authority of the church militant
by taking an oath you made an

assault on Paris on a Sunday you
hurled yourself down from the tower
at Beaurevoir and you persist in
wearing male dress I ask you
again do you believe that you are
in a state of grace

Jeanne takes a deep breath

JEANNE
If I am not may God bring me there
If I am may He keep me there

The admiration of the assessors is almost tangible

INT ANTECHAMBER - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

Buck sweeps everything off the table in a fit of anger
Alone with him Cauchon looks troubled

CAUCHON
Calm down my lord I beg you

BUCK
How can I calm down when Im made
the laughing-stock of the whole
court Ive had enough

CAUCHON
Be patient my lord youve seen
how it is This girl has a way with
people but everyday were making
progress

BUCK

So long as this bitch remains alive
our armies refuse to fight Dont
you understand They want proof
that God is on their side and the
only way theyre going to believe
that is when they see her being
burnt as a witch

Buck takes a mug and pours himself some wine but the
carafe is empty

CAUCHON
It is not for us to burn her my
lord That is your prerogative

BUCK
and your prerogative is to find
her guilty

CAUCHON

But we cant do that unless she

admits to blasphemy

BUCK
Well what are you waiting for
Youve got a castle full of racks
and ropes and pulleys go and
torture the bitch

Cauchon takes out his own personal hip-flask his hand
visibly trembling as he pours Buck some liquor

CAUCHON
You wont be able to drag anything
from her that way You also must
realize that many of my colleagues
are well scared

BUCK
Scared of a girl

CAUCHON
Scared to make a mistake Supposing
shes right supposing she really
has been sent by God

Buck narrows his eyes

BUCK
Whose side are you on Cauchon

CAUCHON
Im on the side of our Mother Holy
Church Besides a confession under
torture will never convince anyone
of her guilt

BUCK
Well find some other way Be
creative Tell them she fucks the
devil Hmm not a bad idea why
cant you say that Sounds good to
me and who can prove she doesnt

Buck drains the liquor
CAUCHON
One small problem my lord The
girl is a virgin
Buck has a horrible glint in his eye
BUCK

That is a very small problem

INT EXT JEANNES CELLCOURTYARD - ROUEN - DAY

Jeanne is
the wall
painting
her

Jeanne is

Jeanne looks helpless The Man smiles turns and looks

smoothing food into the cross she scratched into
She does it with great care as though

The Man appears in the background watching
MAN
What are you doing
delighted and relieved to see him
JEANNE
I -- I cleaned up my room look
and I said my prayers all of
them and
MAN

What are you doing on the wall

JEANNE
Im trying to make my cross look
more beautiful

MAN
What for

JEANNE
Because because I dont know what

else to do to please him

MAN
Do you think this cross will protect
you

JEANNE
No I

out of the window

Far below in the courtyard

MAN
Look at them with their beautiful
cross

soldiers and their wooden cross

MAN

The sight of priests blessing
entire armies before they go off to
kill each other never ceases to
amaze me And that these massacres
should be recorded as acts of faith
in Gods name

(no reaction from

Jeanne)
And they think that making a
beautiful cross or building a

a Priest is blessing a dozen

cathedral will wash away their
sins ridiculous Just like that
priest who accused you of fighting
on a Sunday Did God give
permission to kill each other for
the rest of the week

In the courtyard the soldiers mount their horses

JEANNE
Love your enemies

MAN
(a satisfied smile)
Good But love your enemies
body and soul

Jeanne nods knowing the truth but still not prepared to
admit it

JEANNE
My voices my voices do you
think they will ever come back

MAN
I dont think so

JEANNE
Are you going to leave me too

MAN
Yes of course when you dont
need me anymore
JEANNE
Are you sent by God
FLASH to Jeanne at Orleans
WOMAN

But youve been sent by God

JEANNE
So has everyone
Back to the Man
MAN
So has everyone
Jeanne looks at him -- then at her cross -- then back at

the soldiers in the courtyard below With a lusty cry
they set off at a gallop blessed and ready for battle

JEANNE
Theres nothing for me to do here
anymore I dont belong here I

Jeanne stands up comes and kneels before him kissing

his hands

want to be with Him now

MAN
Do you think you are ready

JEANNE
Yes I am

MAN
Are you willing to follow all His
commandments

JEANNE
Yes

MAN
to love your enemy as much as
you love yourself

Jeanne hesitates a moment -- a short amount of time but
enough for a lie to slip in
JEANNE
Yes Im ready now
The Man smiles
MAN
Lets see
She hears approaching footsteps the SOUND of keys
jangling a lock turns --
-- and the three SOLDIERS walk into the room The first

one has a familiar black beard

BLACKBEARD
Now thats what I call booty

He is none other than her sisters rapist and murderer
Jeanne reacts in terror

JEANNE
Oh no

BLACKBEARD
(undoing his belt)
We thought you must be pretty bored
in here so weve come to liven you

up a bit right lads

JEANNE
Please -- dont do it -- dont hurt
me --

BLACKBEARD
Of course not sweetheart if you
promise to do as I say

Blackbeard caresses her cheek and tries to force her legs

apart but she resists -- whispers imploringly
JEANNE
Where are you Dont leave me
please
BLACKBEARD
Hey come on open up

His two comrades egg him on Jeanne struggles even
harder and Blackbeard suddenly becomes violent He grabs
her by the throat thrusts her against the bed and tears
off her clothes Jeanne suddenly goes berserk yelling
and thrashing like a cornered animal

BLACKBEARD
Stop screaming like that Youll
wake up the whole bleedin castle

Blackbeard clamps his hand over her mouth whereupon
Jeanne summons hidden reserves of strength and ina
sudden surge manages to clamp her chains around
Blackbeards neck she presses down on the chains
choking him strangling him

The two other soldiers come to Blackbeards rescue and
manage to haul her off Blackbeard gropes his throat
then belts her across the face

BLACKBEARD
Ah so you want to play it rough
Good I like it better that way

He pulls out a knife and starts to tear at her clothes
while the two others hold her down Jeanne struggles for
her life -- yelling spitting biting scratching --

Blackbeard is too excited to pay any attention Nor does
he notice the door open and the Duchess enter with the
Guard

DUCHESS
Stop that at once Thats an order

But to Blackbeard it could be Jeanne speaking The
Duchess in her nightgown grabs Blackbeard by the
shoulders

DUCHESS
I command you to stop in the name
of the King

The mention of the King jolts Blackbeard to attention

DUCHESS
Leave her alone do you hear Come
on get out

The three soldiers back sheepishly away

BLACKBEARD
We were just having a little fun
thats all keeping her company

DUCHESS
Men like you are the cause of our
countrys dishonor

BLACKBEARD
We were serving our country just
obeying orders maam

The Duchess doesnt want to hear more

DUCHESS
Go on get out of here

The Guards hustle the three soldiers from the room but
not before Blackbeard has mumbled --

BLACKBEARD
See you later angel

The soldiers leave and the Guard bolts the door behind
them Jeanne curls up on her bed destroyed humiliated
lost The Duchess caresses her face and doesnt know what
to do to comfort her The Guard brings a blanket --
probably his

JEANNE
Thank you

She wraps the blanket round Jeanne and presses the little
cross back in her hand

DUCHESS
This wont happen again I give you
my word

INT ROOM - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

The Duchess storms into a room where Cauchon is talking
with Bedford and Buck She walks up to him

BEDFORD
And What a pleasant surprise

and slaps him across the face as he has never been
slapped before

DUCHESS
You should know that each
humiliation you inflict on this
woman you inflict on all women
including yours my lord

BEDFORD
Wha what on earth are you talking
about

DUCHESS
If you send anymore of your soldiers
to Jeannes cell I will kill them
myself

The Duchess turns and sweeps past Cauchon leaving Bedford
staring at Buck who looks decidedly embarrassed Bedford
turns to Cauchon

BEDFORD
Im giving you one more day

Then he turns and leaves

EXT CEMETERY OF ST OUEN - DAY

A masked Executioner stands beside a stake piled high
with faggots Jeanne her hands bound stands nearby
facing a podium filled with the usual assembly of priests
and prelates headed by Cauchon He rises to address
Jeanne

CAUCHON
Jeanne my very dear friend in
Christ we your judges and
assessors desirous of reaching a
true and lawful verdict submitted a
transcript of your trial to the
University of Paris in order to
obtain their opinion After careful
consideration the learned scholars
have concluded with us that you have
committed many grievous sins and I
ask you to listen most carefully to
their opinion as contained in these
articles

Cauchon hands a manuscript to one of the assessors Canon
Pierre Maurice then resumes his seat Among the monks we
spot Aulon who slowly tries to make his way toward
Jeanne

MAURICE

Article One You have said that
from an early age you have had
revelations from the blessed saints
and angels that you have seen them
with your own eyes and that they
speak to you As to this article
the learned scholars have declared
that these claims are untrue
pernicious and evil and that all
such revelations are superstitious
and proceed from the devil

The Duke of Bedford and his English peers are in a
separate stand guarded by English soldiers The cemetery
walls and the branches of trees beyond are crowded with
spectators

The English are impatient to carry out sentence but
Maurice is not a man to be intimidated Jeanne seems
hardly aware of what is being said

MAURICE
Article Two You said that by Gods
command you have continually worn
mens clothes and that you have
also worn your hair short without
nothing

From Jeannes POV Maurices drone FADES and the crowd
seems to disappear She whispers in agony

JEANNE
My lord dont abandon me where
are you Is this what you want
You want me to burn To burn
without being confessed Ill do
anything you want but dont leave
me

Jeanne is completely alone in the middle of the cemetery
Only the graves the stakes and the moaning wind

JEANNE
Dont leave me here please
dont leave me alone

Suddenly the crowd is back with Maurice droning on

MAURICE
Finally Article Twelve You have
said that you are not willing to
submit yourself to the judgment of
the Church Militant but only to
God As to this Article the
scholars say that you have no
comprehension of the authority of
the Church that you have

perniciously erred in the faith of
God and that you are a child of
superstition a wanderer from the
Faith an invoker of demons a
sorceress an idolater and a
heretic

Maurice resumes his seat while Chatillon approaches

Jeanne

CHATILLON
Jeanne we once again admonish beg
and exhort you to cast out and
recant your erroneous beliefs and
return into the way of truth by
submitting yourself to the authority
of our Mother Holy Church by signing
this recantation

Jeanne looks at the parchment in confusion

Chatillon throws up his hands in despair

JEANNE
If the church wants me to say that
my visions are evil then I dont
believe in this church and I submit
myself to the judgment of God

brimming with anticipation He calls out to the

Executioner

The Executioner turns to Jeanne
Cauchon strides over --

hold of her

Cauchon grabs the document from Chatillon and holds it up

to Jeanne

BEDFORD
Perform your office

CAUCHON
Wait

CAUCHON

Jeanne I beg of you sign

(Jeanne looks dazed)
In Gods name dont you understand
Im trying to save you If you
dont sign the English will burn
you to death Is that what you
want

JEANNE
No I want to be confessed

Cauchon hands her a quill The English are getting
agitated heckling Cauchon to hand her over but the

Bedford is

but before he can take

spectators in the trees and on the wall are urging her
escape the pyre by signing Jeanne begins to waver

CAUCHON
Sign this and I will confess you
myself if you want

JEANNE
And may I go to Mass
CAUCHON
As often as you like -- now please
-- for the love of God -- sign
Again Jeanne looks about for the Man but sees only the

Executioner waiting to conduct her to the stake

CAUCHON
Sign and youll be free from your
chains free from the fire
Jeanne now sign
The Crowd begins to chant Sign sign sign Aulon who
has managed to get closer joins them
AULON

Sign Jeanne -- sign

Bedford is in a panic as Jeanne takes the quill and makes
her mark -- a wavering cross at the bottom of the
parchment The Crowd cheers Aulon is ecstatic but
their voices go silent as the Man once again appears from
behind Cauchon

MAN

You know what you just signed
Jeanne You just signed away my
existence For you Ima lie an
illusion

(Jeanne is horrified)
You see In the end you were the
one who abandoned me

JEANNE
No

the Man a smile of faint regret and disappears
Jeanne turns to Cauchon

JEANNE
Please may I have it back

CAUCHON
You have nothing to regret

She tries to grab it from Cauchon but soldiers pinion
her

JEANNE
I didnt mean it I didnt know
what I was signing You tricked
me

CAUCHON
Silence her
(soldier clamps hand
over her mouth)
Take her away

The Soldiers hustle her away as Cauchon walks back to the
podium Aulon is relieved and yet strangely
apprehensive Cauchon hands the Duke the document signed
by Jeanne

CAUCHON
There she has recanted and we
accept her repentance for the
church never closes her arms to
those who return to the fold Shes
yours to do whatever you want with
her but the church has nothing to
do with it anymore Shes your
prisoner -- your martyr -- not ours

Bedford cant answer as the Duchess is next to him

INT DUNGEON - ROUEN CASTLE - NIGHT

Jeanne is flung into a filthy dungeon Buck appears in
the doorway and flings male clothes in her face

BUCK
Here in case you want to get
dressed -- try these for size
JEANNE
He promised Id be confessed and
go to Mass and be free from these
chains
BUCK
We never promised you anything But
this much I can promise you that
you wont be leaving this dungeon
till the day you die
The Guards laugh slamming and bolting the door behind
her Jeanne sinks to her knees in grief and anguish

EXT ROUEN CASTLE - DAWN
Dawn is breaking beyond the distant castle

INT CHURCH - DAY

Cauchon is alone lost in his thoughts A young monk runs

in out of breath
MONK
My lord Bishop come quickly
EXT COURTYARD - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

Cauchon and the Monk hurry across the castle courtyard

Aulon sees them pass anxious at their apparent concern

INT DUNGEON - ROUEN CASTLE - DAY

Cauchon arrives in Jeannes dungeon out of breath It is
full of people Bedford his Aide priests and soldiers

BEDFORD
Ah Cauchon come to see for
yourself Well take a look

Beyond them stands Jeanne her back to us dressed as a
man

BEDFORD
You see Dressed as a man again
Her touching repentance didnt last
very long did it The Bishop of
Senlis was passing by and was on
hand to witness her very evident
relapse

CAUCHON
And by what miracle did these
clothes find their way in here

BEDFORD
Not a miracle my dear Cauchon an
evil spell This girl is a witch
and tomorrow she will burn for it
(to Buck)
Have the stake prepared in the
market place

Jeanne doesnt say a word She stands with her back to
us gazing up at the dim crack of light bleeding in
through the high window-slit Bedford exits with the
others leaving Cauchon alone with Jeanne

CAUCHON
I dont understand Jeanne why
did you do it Why

JEANNE
And you Why did you lie You
promised I could be confessed

CAUCHON
I know Jeanne it was the only
way to save you from the fire

JEANNE
Its not my body I want to save
Its my soul

Jeanne turns round and we see that she is strangely calm
as though a great weight had been lifted from her She
kneels before Cauchon

He hurries out of the cell

him

JEANNE
I ask only one thing to hear me
in confession

CAUCHON
I -- I cant Jeanne I cant hear
your confession Im sorry

materializes and sits next to her

MAN
Do you really want to confess
Jeanne
(Jeanne nods)
Im listening

He turns his back as the Priest did in the confessional

JEANNE
I have committed sins my Lord -- so
many sins As a child the only way
I could help my people was to pray
So I prayed to God and his saints
I prayed more and more and gave God
all my love but isnt it said
that God helps them who help
themselves So I helped myself
and I saw signs the ones I wanted
to see -- and I fought out of
revenge and despair Yes I was
proud -- stubborn -- selfish -- and
cruel I was all the things that
humans believe they are allowed to
be when theyre fighting for a
cause

The Man smiles a little satisfied sigh

A Guard locks the door behind
and Jeanne is alone But not for long The Man

MAN
You think you are ready now

JEANNE
Yes my lord
MAN
Lets see
As he disappears she hears a noise turns round and

sees a Guard in the doorway

A beat then the Guard topples forward to the floor blood
oozing from his mouth Behind him stands a Priest He
pulls a sword from the Guards body then throws back his
hood It is Aulon He runs to Jeanne and takes her in
his arms

AULON
Jeanne thank God

He quickly sets about removing her chains from her
ankle

AULON
We must hurry -- I took care of the
guard but others are coming

Jeanne gently caresses his hand

JEANNE
I am ready now

AULON
Just give me a moment and then
youll be free

JEANNE
Im already free
AULON
(preoccupied)
Yes yes any moment youre

always so impatient

Jeanne puts her hand on his to stop him wasting his time

JEANNE
My gentle Captain Im staying
AULON
I -- I dont understand
JEANNE
One day you will
AULON

She caresses his face with both hands
Aulon continues to talk but his eyes are
beginning to brim with tears

gently

You dont know what youre saying
Youre going to leave this place
Jeanne -- youre going home -- or
whatever you want -- youre going to
be happy and have children and

that Jeanne has made her decision

AULON

» and maybe the king will give you
some money and a little land anda
title even

(smiling through his

tears)
» wouldnt that be a fine thing
You a lady of title

JEANNE
Im staying Jean

AULON
No you must come Jeanne -- we need
you -- so much has happened since
you left I have a new horse now
a white one just like yours and

La Hire hardly swears at all
anymore

(crying)
You cant stay -- theyll burn you

JEANNE
Im not afraid of the fire anymore
It will purify me

AULON
Jeanne you cant leave us like
this

Jeanne smiles at him

She speaks gently but with resolution there is no going

back and Aulon knows it He hears the distant SOUND of

JEANNE
I am at peace now my gentle
friend at peace with myself

soldiers approaching

Aulon takes Jeannes face in his hands and kisses her on
the only one and the last one

the lips

A full kiss

which Jeanne neither encourages nor resists

JEANNE
You must go

smiling at him

he knows its useless

She says it gently but urgently With tears welling
Aulon tears himself from her sight and disappears Jeanne
is left alone strangely calm and serene Slowly she
raises her finger-tips to her lips touches them
softly

The Man emerges from the darkness carrying an ornate
Cross on a long pole bearing an effigy of the crucified
Christ

MAN
Ego te absolvo in nomine Patris et
Filii et Spiritus Sancti Amen

He stands in front of her raising the Cross above

EXT ROUEN MARKET PLACE - DAY

Jeanne who looks up to see the crucifix rising
against a clear blue sky now held aloft by a Priest She
is bound to the stake her head shaved At the base of
the pyre the EXECUTIONER sprinkles the faggots with
oil

EXECUTIONER
Dont worry its going to be
fast I used plenty of dry wood so
therell be lots of smoke but
dont forget to breath fast and
youll be dizzy before the flames
even get to you

A great CROWD has assembled in the market place Ona
podium is the Duke of Bedford trying to remain impassive
Beside him the Duchess can barely contain her emotions
Further along stands Cauchon his eyes lowered not
wanting to see

Still disguised as a monk Aulon stands close to the pyre
tormented and torn between revenge and despair

Bedford makes a sign to the Executioner who then takes a
torch and sets fire to the brushwood Flames erupt and
Jeannes breathing quickens As thick smoke rises the
Priest begins to cough his eyes water and he can no
longer hold up the cross to Jeannes sight She begins to
panic her eyes wildly searching

JEANNE
the cross show me the
cross please

The Priest struggles to hold it up but the choking smoke
drives him back

JEANNE
Where where are you

Jeanne is filled with panic the Priest is bent double
with coughing and can get no closer

JEANNE
please the cross

Suddenly Aulon rushes forward grabs the cross from the
Priest and boldly defies the smoke and flames risking his
life as he holds it high for Jeanne

Finally the cross is visible to her rising above the
flames into a clear blue sky Her anxiety melts her eyes
fill with tears of hope as she gazes up at the cross

As her eyes close the image of the cross becomes engulfed
with flames until the smoke finally fills the SCREEN

plunging it into darkness

CUT TO
BLACK

THE END
