Seigel is calm yet honest carefully honest

SEIGEL
The cause of the explosion is
undetermined Nassau county

search and rescue are en route

He gestures and thats all we know The group slips deeper into
despair

WEINE
We understand how you must be
feeling at this hour and although
we know it may be difficult we must
ask you some questions regarding
todays events while its still
fresh in your minds

The survivors dread the thought of recounting the horrible experience
yet collectively are ready to co-operate

green and brown and orange teen angst poorly communicated Glued to

something

appear foolish over her bad artwork indicates the metal

CLEAR
A piece of debris from the plane
I went to the shore off the crash
site and it washed up on the beach

ALEX
You went there Ive wanted to go
there but I thought it was off
limits

CLEAR
It is But that didnt stop me
Shouldnt stop you

Alex gently touches the piece of the plane almost expecting to feel
something more than cold metal He looks to Clear

ALEX
Why were you there last night

While she cleans brushes with a can of turpentine

CLEAR
Look Ive seen enough TV to know
the FBI doesnt investigate teen
suicides But they were there last
night that means one they still
dont have a clue what caused the
crash Two they havent ruled out
anything And the fact that seven
people got off the plane is probably
weird enough not to mention that
one of those people had a vision or
whatever of it exploding minutes
before it did explode is highly
suspicious And it doesnt help that
the visionaries friend just
committed suicide
Alex eyes her for a long beat She turns away from him returning the
can of turpentine to a shelf

ALEX
Why were you there last night

Clear turns to Alex The two couldnt appear more different She moves
to a sculpture an ugly black and green globular sculpture with a
white dot in the center

CLEAR
Know what this is

Alex cocks his eyebrow probably thinking a mess but tactfully
shakes his head no

CLEAR
Its you

Remaining dry and stoned faced Alex tenses uncomfortable

CLEAR
Not a likeness Its how you make
me feel Alex

ALEX
Im really sorry

CLEAR
Like you the sculpture doesnt even
know what or why it is Reluctant
to take form And yet creating an
absolute but incomprehansible
attraction

Uncertain and yet moved Alex listens

CLEAR (CONTD)

Before that day you were just
another suburban nothing that would
never have anything to do with my
life And Im sure you thought I was
some Marilyn Manson body-pierced
freak or whatever

But at that moment on the plane
I felt what you felt I didnt know
where all those emotions were coming
from until you started freaking out

Alex sighs embarrassed
CLEAR (CONTD)
I didnt see what you saw but I
felt it Okay Im not into all that

X-Files bullshit but it was a
psychic connection Why to me Why
to you

Jarred he eyes her frightened

CLEAR
And you can still feel it cant
you Something from that day is
still with you I know because I
can still feel you

Alex is increasingly uncomfortable with the subject but eased by
Clears apparent somewhat understanding Lowering his tone

CLEAR
Thats why I was there last night

ALEX
Ive never dealt with death before
I wasnt alive when my grandparents
died I wish I could know I mean

all this could just be in our

With a hot mischievous smile Clear proceeds toward the hallway Alex
anxiously sighs then follows

INT DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT

An elevator with collapsible metal door lowers INTO FRAME Pushing the
door aside Alex and Clear proceed into the hallway lined with morgue
green tile Stainless steel gurneys and porcelain equipment holding
yellow surgical tubing and thick foot-long needles sit in the
corridor

A faint light spills from beneath a doorway Clear reaches out to the
knob but Alex quickly grabs her hand From a cart behind them he
pulls a latex glove out of a box and snaps it on

CLEAR
Good call Very Quincy

Alex tries the doorknob Locked He looks at her defeated Clear
quickly points to some morticians tools on the cart
From it Alex produces a thin six inch needle He inserted the tool in
the lock and jimmies the doorknob CLACK

INT MORGUE - FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT

A lone desk lamp shines Across the room laying on a porcelain table
fluid draining tubes attached lies Tod A sheet is pulled up to his
shoulders He carries the macabre appearence of a corspe having been
made up by a mortician Hair combed and sprayed skin tone too orange
blush too rouge and lips too red

As Alex and Clear approach

ALEX
That him
CLEAR
I think But whyd they make him
up like Michael Jackson
ALEX
Thats him but hes not here
That whatever that whatever

made him Tod is gone

Suddenly Tod jerks his hand lifting four inches

ALEX CLEAR
Ahhh fuck You fucking Ohmygod OHMYGOD OHMYGOD
asshole You think this Hes not dead

dick Tod if youre
not dead Im gonna
fucking kill you

MR BLUDWORTH (0S)
Please dont yell

Both are jolted again with shock turning toward the voice
MR BLUDWORTH

CAMERA PUSHES LOW ANGLE INTO WILLAIM BLUDWORTH an African-American
man early 50s dressed in dark suit and tie

MR BLUDWORTH
Youll wake the dead

He flashes a dry morticians smile pleased by his wan pun Alex and
Clear havent recovered from the corspes actions to calmly address
Bludworth
ALEX
Why

Alex completes his question by raising his hand ala Tods dead body
Bludworth nods understanding

MR BLUDWORTH
Chemicals in the vascular flush
create cadaveric spasm

As the startle of the situation settles it dawns on Alex that they
have been busted He nervously offers an explanation

ALEX
Im a friend of his His best
friend See his father

MR BLUDWORTH
(ominous)
I know who you are
The mortician eyes Alex understanding Alex senses this and eases
Clear moves toward Tods body examining the neck area

CLEAR
They said he hung himself but
theres no marks

MR BLUDWORTH
I crafted a reconstruction of the
Laryngeal prominence region with
Velvetone Surgical Wax and
Permaseal

Clear moves in for a closer look then calls Alex over to the body
After a beat of reluctance Alex looks at Tods neck

ALEX
What are all those tiny marks

ALEXS POV - CLOSE - TODS NECK

The wounds have been filled with wax and covered by greasepaint At
this proximity however it is apparent tiny cuts line the area above
and below the large cut made by the wire

MR BLUDWORTH (VO)
Cuticle lacerations

WIDER

ALEX
Why would he pull at the wire if he
were committing suicide

CLEAR
Why would they say it was a
suicide if it werent

Because of the supernatural message he recieved Alex is reluctant
to answer He eyes Mr Bludworth who with a wry half smile eyes
Alex as if aware of the reason behind his hesitation

ALEX
His fathers pretty fucked up with
denial Maybe he couldnt deal with
the thought of an other accident
taking another son

MR BLUDWORTH
In Death

CAMERA INCHES TOWARD the mortician In this environment lit with
Fritz Lang shadows Bludworths tone appearance he could easily be
mistaken for personification of the subject

MR BLUDWORTH
there are no accidents No
coincidencess No mishaps
(smiles)
And no escapes

ALEX
You saying Tod did kill himself

Bludworth moves to Tod on the draining table disconnecting the tubes
connecting the body to the embalming chemicals

MR BLUDWORTH
Suicide Murder Plane crash What
does it matter He was going to end
someday From the minute youre cut
loose from the womb its a one
way ticket on a trip to the tomb

Vile liquid oozes out of the body onto the porcelain table

MR BLUDWORTH
You may not realize it but were
all just a mouse that a cat has by
its tail Every single move we
make from the mundane to the
monumental the red light we stop
at or run the people we have sex
with or wont with us the airplane

we ride or walk out of is alla

part of Deaths sadistic design
leading to the grave

ALEX
Design

The mortician considers as he drains some yellowish green fluid from
the table He shrugs then continues his work

MR BLUDWORTH

If Life is like a box of
chocolates Death Death is like
a big Milton Bradley game of Mouse
Trap The day youre born is just
the boot hanging from the
streetlamp kicking the marble to
get things rolling Growing up is
only the marble rolling down the
curving chute You feel immortal
having survived school sex drugs
n rock n roll but youve really

only upset the big hand holding the
steel ball that falls into the
bathtub Marriage and kids and
career seem to make it all worthwhile
until the ball hits the see-saw and
flips the diving man into the big
barrel In the old folks home or the

hospital you just see the big cage
rattling down until it captures
the mouse

(beat)

Game over

Alex considers as Clear eyes him conveying this guyss whacked
Alex moves toward Bludworth

ALEX
Maybe theres no way to win
but if you figured out the
game you knew where the steel

ball was rolling couldnt you
avoid the trap and extend the
playing time Couldnt you cheat
Death at Its own game

Mr Bludworth looks directly at Alex CAMERA MOVES IN ON EACH
INDIVIDUALLY this between the two of them

MR BLUDWORTH
You already did that by walking off

the plane Now you gotta out when
and how itll come back at you

(beat)
Play your hunch Alex If you think
you can get away from it

(beat)

But beware the risk of cheating the
plan disrespecting the design
could iniciate a horrifying fury that
would terrorize even the Grim Reaper

(beat)

And you dont even want to fuck with

that Mack Daddie

Alexs eyes are locked on Bludworths chilling pleasant smile The
mortician yanks on a tube REVEALING a foot long needle removed from
Tods spinal column The horrific nature of death is vividly
demonstrated to Alex

ALEX
Im sorry we broke in

MR BLUDWORTH
No harm No foul

Alex grabs her arm starting toward the door
CLEAR

for

He cautiously flashes a greeting smile The teacher however averts
her eyes and continues into the coffee shop Alex sighs guiltily
Clear sympathizes with both of them

CLEAR

No

from someone

hinting at the design
CLEAR
Alex on the plane you must have

experienced some kind of hyper
awareness But here youre
suggesting Tods death and maybe
our own will happen because of
an active Presence
Alex nods feeling shes understanding
ALEX
The mortician said Death has a
design Now if you me Tod
Carter Terry Billy Ms Lewton
messed up that design because for
whatever reason I was able to see

Alex grabs the knife and pulls it out He quickly removes another and
another yet there is no reaction from the woman

Browning sits in the sand searching for an answer somewhere in the
darkness of the evening sea

Behind him 0S approaching in the sand SOFT FOOTSTEPS He listens
notes them Yet rather than turn around he looks up into the sky

ALEXS POV - THE SKY

The shoreline lights cast an orange haze on the stars breaking
through infinitely above

ALEX (0S)
Are they up there

WIDER

Clear Rivers approaches barefoot in the sand He neddnt turn to know
who is behind him

ALEX (CONTD)
Somehow is 180 still in flight
Somewhere are they still safe
Clear hasnt met eyes with Alex but she sits nearby looking into the

sky
CLEAR

When I was a kid like six or
seven I used to worry so much
about my parents dying Like lying
awake at night just worrying I
loved them so much I didnt want
them to get hurt And what would
happen to me What would life be
like

(beat)
Every night it seemed

She looks out at the stars He doesnt eye her either

ALEX
Most kids do I guess

CLEAR
Most kids never have it happen

Alex hangs his head

CLEAR
When I was ten my dad went into a
7-11 for cigerettes I guess he heard
somebody say Dont turn around So
on reflex or thinkin a friend was
jokin he did And the guy blew
his head off

She has lived this so many times she is long beyond crying

CLEAR (CONTD)

And let me tell ya I had every
reason to worry before because
life became shit I dont blame her
I guess but my mom couldnt deal
with it at all She married this
asshole who my mom with my real
dad would cross the street to avoid
this guy He really didnt want a
kid And so my mom didnt either
anymore I guess

(beat)

If that was the design for my
father and my family then fuck
Death FUCK IT

The waves continue to shore Clear looks up at the sky
CLEAR (CONTD)

And so anyway Ive thought of
that somewhere Alex It exists
that place

He looks at her

CLEAR (CONTD)
Where my dad is still safe Where he
had a full pack of cigerettes and
kept driving A place where me and

my dad and my mom are still
togetherand have no idea about
this second life here
(beat)
A place where our friends are still
in the sky where everyone gets a

second chance
She looks at him

CLEAR (CONTD)

But that place might only exist in

my heart And maybe now yours I
havent experienced too many second
chances in my life I havent seen
any But because of all of this I
believe because of you I will
get a second chance Because of me
you will With you in my life that
place right now existing in our
hearts will spring out and become
a real part of this life

Alex looks within her as a soft ocean breeze blows through Clears
hair

CLEAR
And that is the only way we can beat
Death by making something special

out of Life

His eyes well with tears Only as she looks at Alex does Clear become
emotional they move closer and kiss the desire for each other to
defy the events around them darkness the isolation

They dive into a deep feverish kiss Embracing as if the tighter the
safer She pulls him back down to the beach and lifts his shirt over
his head

ALEX
This wont be safe

Clear looks down the beach checking for any sight of Billy and
Carter

CLEAR
Those guys are probably fifteen
minutes away

ALEX
No I mean I dont have anything
on me This wont be safe

CLEAR
(sadly)
Nothing is anymore

Alex looks to Clear then kisses her with passion that reflects the
defiance of death He pulls open her shirt and falls into her arms
