FADE IN

OVER CENTRAL PARK

Gorgeous fall day Hot-chestnut weather Spider-Man sails
in off Central Park West on a line of silk King of the

Manhattan skyline Swinging from a turret of the Dakota

PETER (VO)

Look at this guy

Sailing over the Sheep Meadow bouncing off the top of

Reptile House Sharp turn onto Fifth Avenue hard around the

Plaza Hotel

PETER (VO) (contd)

Look at him Like he doesnt have a care

in the world

FIFTH AVENUE

is a torrent of taxis and humans and steam from the manholes
He skims along it like a dragonfly heading downtown

PETER (VO)
You probably think itd be cool to trade
places with this guy Styling costume
Awesome powers Greatest damn city in

the world

AT 36TH STREET

He throws down a great big giant elastic band of webbing
Turns a couple of office towers into an enormous slingshot

Curls into a ball and hits the rubber band dead center

PETER (VO)

Is that what youre thinking

He gets just enough bounce to catapult him up over the top of

the Empire State Building Toe barely grazes the needle tip

PETER (VO) (contd)

Well maybe youd better think again
He pinballs down Fifth Avenue and then out

OVER UNION SQUARE

Heading for the Flatiron Building with the big DAILY BUGLE

sign Circling in alighting on its roof

PETER (VO)
Maybe youd better wait until you see the

kind of day this guys having

INT JJJS OFFICE — DAY

He tosses a stack of photos at PETER PARKER Theyre awfully

nice photos Maybe a little too nice
JIJ
Dogs catching Frisbees in the park
Some fat old geezer playing chess

Autumn leaves

PETER
I was thinking maybe the Bugle could show

another side of New York for a change—-

JIJ
Parker if I believed for one second
those pictures were an accurate
reflection of this town Id hang myself
from the top of the Chrysler Building
I dont pay you to be a sensitive artist
I pay you because for some reason that

psycho Spider-Man will pose for you

PETER
Well its like I told you Mr Jameson
Spider-Man wont let me take any more
pictures of him He says you only use

them to slander him Youve turned the
whole city against him

JIJ
A fact Im very proud of Having that
lunatic around has weakened the moral
fiber of New York The police are
demoralized The citizens lazy Now get
your pretty little portfolio out of my

face before I go into a diabetic coma

PETER
Mr Jameson please You cant fire me
Even working two jobs I can barely make
tuition and Aunt Mays social security

doesnt amount to

JJJ mimes tying a noose around his neck throws his head

back thrusts his tongue from his mouth Peter folds

PETER (contd)
What if--all right what if I did have a

shot of Spider-Man
Peter reaches into his knapsack and takes out a manila
folder Slides out a fantastic shot of Spider-Man saving a

nun from an oncoming meat truck JJJ eyes it hungrily

JIJJ

It stinks Ill give you three hundred

He reaches for it Peter snatches it back

PETER
No Theres no way I can sell you this
shot until you agree to run more

balanced coverage of Spider-man

JIJ
I take my journalistic responsibility to
present balanced coverage very seriously
Parker you know that Fine Ill give
you four Ill nominate him for a

goddamn medal Parker You have my word

PETER

JIJ
Thats outrageous

Peter lets go of the photo then sits a moment Knowing he

has just made big mistake

Peter snaps out of it looks at his watch oh shit He

leaps to his feet grabs his knapsack and runs out

Harmattan and Buran for seventeen extra
large deep-dish pizzas In eight

money for these pizzas I will lose the
customer forever to Pizza Yurt And they

are killing me already

PETER

Why didnt you send Salim

MR AZIZ
Salim was deported yesterday I have no

hope but you You must make it in time

He starts thrusting pizzas at Peter stacking them in Peters

arms until we cant see his face anymore

MR AZIZ (contd)
You are a nice young man Peter but you
are not dependable This is the last
chance I can give you You must cross
forty-two blocks in seven and one half

gets out too The three men come to blows

Peter pops up onto the sidewalk Mistake An old lady ina
wheelchair comes out of nowhere Peter hits the brakes
Swerves The bike stalls He kicks wildly at the starter

dead And its 548

Peter leaps off the bike With a mighty heave he wrenches
the hotbox right off the back of the motorcycle snapping

bolts twisting metal Then he ducks into an alley

EXT LOWER MANHATTAN - NEW YORK STREET — AERIAL SHOT

Spider-Man swings toward the Woolworth Building One-handed
since the hotbox is tucked under his left arm At the end of

each arc he freefalls until he shoots the next strand of web

Below two boys chase each other and a basketball into the

street A car is coming right at them

Spider-Mans spider sense tingles He looks down sees the
trajectories of car ball and boys pure vectors of physics

plotted against the air collision

Spider-Man heaves the hotbox away It arcs heavenward With

his hand now free he shoots a strand of web
A lasso of web encircles the boys and yanks the boys toward
the opposite side of the street Sets them on their feet

The car squeals past horn BLARING

The boys dazed The basketball shoots in a web-slung chest

pass One of them catches it They look up at the sky

Spider-Man catches up to the hotbox as it hurtles earthward
past him Snags it with a web and drags it back up The
Woolworth Building looms Spider-Man snags its pinnacle and

arcs around it circling in

INT WOOLWORTH BUILDING - LAW OFFICES - DAY

Peter rushes in with the stack of pizzas Out of breath

kind of wild looking A big silly grin on his face

trouble if you would just tell me how you

Bars descend indicators flare as they shut the door
INT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY — DAVIS AUDITORIUM — NIGHT

Packed house of researchers reporters interested members of

the public PROF CZERNOWITZ is introducing Otto Octavius

CZERNOWITZ
as a doctoral candidate he was
dazzling Now Im afraid hes left us
mere mortals far behind Its my great
honor to present director of the Anansi
Project winner of a National Science

Medal Dr Otto Octavius

APPLAUSE as Otto strides out Younger than you might expect
Wearing a long black Gaultier jacket Smiling like a man
with a surprise in store for us He and Czernowitz meet A

stiffness between them Czernowitz looks intimidated

OTTO

Frank

CZERNOWITZ
Otto

They shake hands awkwardly Then Otto strides to the podium
Grins self mocking Behind him on a table a violin and

bow Piano to one side

OTTO
He told you I was dazzling but what
hes too nice to bring up is was what an

insufferable little wretch I was

Laughter The lights dim spot on Otto Behind him a large
flatpanel monitor descends As he talks the display will

mirror expand on and illustrate his words

OTTO (contd)
Biomimetics seeks to adapt for human use
the technologies of other species We
poor humans have always envied our fellow
creatures their talents soon we will

share them

Peter is rapt Harry is playing Tetris on his Palm Pilot
OTTO (contd)
My own researches have been into arachnid
technology adapting the remarkable
abilities of spiders their web-spinning
abilities their astonishing almost

precognitive impulse control

Harry notices how spellbound Peter is leans over

HARRY
I will never understand this spider thing

of yours

Peter takes no notice

OTTO
We had some success with manipulating
spider RNA But its in the area of
octopedal locomotion that things are
really getting exciting The goal is to
provide stable motion on every possible

kind of terrain and superior manipulation
at a distance

Otto steps out from behind the podium

OTTO (contd)
You cant imagine the sheer number
crunching might required to control and
coordinate eight legs Really tough
Actually it was a chance visit to the

Bronx Zoo that gave me the key insight

He walks toward the monitor which displays an octopus along

with a diagram of its nervous system

OTTO (contd)
The octopus has the equivalent of a
powerful processor in each leg networked

to the central unit in her brain

The display fades to a diagram of the Rig eight legs
networked to each other through and to the center The

center is empty then a diagrammatic human operator appears
OTTO (contd)
Now so far the capacity to control the
full complement of eight legs is beyond
our capacity But weve been able to

implement a similar system using

Otto takes a step forward smiling a little coyly Then from
somewhere behind him a pair of glinting pseudopods snake out
The black stealth-bomber glint of superhard ceramic A gasp

from the audience

OTTO (contd)

Four

Harry sits up Puts away the Palm Pilot

The pods hover over Ottos shoulders a moment undulant

OTTO (contd)

I call it a self-articulating network

but Im afraid the name that has stuck is

Ottos Octopus
One pod reaches to tap him on the shoulder

OTTO (contd)
Yes Oh thank you It is a little warm

in here

The arms help him out of the jacket and as it comes off
another pair of pseudopods is revealed The audience goes a

little nuts

One pod takes up the violin another the bow The next
pair snake out toward the piano Otto strikes up a Grieg
sonata With his own two hands he takes out a fat cigar and

lights it puffs contentedly

The audience amazed afraid half suspecting that its all a

prank Peter with a look of open-mouthed wonder

The music breaks off

Now the pods assume a configuration like a daddy long-legs

toes splayed against the dais arching high into the air

Among them hangs perfectly at ease Otto One at a time in
turn he raises and lowers each foot

OTTO (contd)
Each one of my four assistants here is
equipped with its own hundred-teraflop

processor

He begins to stride back and forth across the stage on his

four dancing pseudopods

OTTO (contd)
Computer architecture so sophisticated
and capable of learning it approaches

consciousness

He sinks back onto the two lower ‘pods The upper ones snake

out around him

OTTO (contd)
At times I feel the Rig here has a life

of its own

LEFT UPPER PSEUDOPOD takes a piece of paper from Ottos
pocket RIGHT UPPER produces a pen and scrawls something
across the paper Then the pod with the paper slaps it
across Ottos back He turns around as if confused walking

on the lower pseudopods The sign says GEEK

Laughter from the audience Theyre eating this up

Otto back to the audience whirls his head around

OTTO (contd)
Given time and a strong enough host
(rueful smile)
its systems and my own would actually

begin to integrate with each other

The pseudopods rip away his shirt revealing THE RIG nestled

right up against his spine overlapping his own flesh

OTTO (contd)

--Merge into one organism

AUDIENCE
Shock even revulsion at the sight of the implants Then a

surge of APPLAUSE

PETER

Gapes bowled over

PETER

You have to introduce me to him

HARRY

Dont you have a diva waiting

Peter checks his watch

PETER

Ican make it

INT DAVIS AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Otto lurches in on the pseudopods to a ROAR of applause from

the hall
The pods telescope in and Otto falls to the floor But one

of the pods remains slightly extended

OTTOS team crowds around him and drag him over to the NEURAL

COUPLER UNIT They mount it around him

The TEAM LEADER twists the Rigs LATCH This is a dial with

a glass tube at its heart like a spirit level with a single

glowing bubble of air He aligns the bubble with a mark and--

WHAM-the pod LASHES out and knocks the Team Leader aside

INT DAVIS AUDITORIUM - AUDIENCE - NIGHT

People are still applauding But Peters spider-sense

TINGLES He gets up

PETER

Ill meet you in the lobby

HARRY

Where are you--
PETER

Too much coffee

INT DAVIS AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

The Rig is out of control Otto hangs from it like a doll
The pseudopods whip and buzzsaw Smash lightbulbs Scatter

humans

Spider-Man leaps into the middle of the cyclone He tries to

reach Otto The pods feint and block

He fires web snares at the pods pins them to the wall They

break free lash out Knock Spider-Man down

Spidey leaps up fires a strand in either direction snags
the upper two ‘pods Yanks them toward himself Ties them
ina knot They GRIND in protest Keeping a grip on the

knot he--

Spins a thick cocoon around each of the lower ones padding
each out until its a gently flailing balloon The Rig

struggles for a moment then powers down Otto falls to the
floor the pods knotted across him

Spider-Man kneels beside Otto Making sure hes okay

The Team Members hurry over with the coupler Spider-Man
gets out of the way The team gets Otto into i and the Team

Leader twists the Latch

SPLORCH The rig pops open Otto falls out

We see that Ottos bare muscular back is enhanced by four

neural sockets They roll him over

Otto opens his eyes The irises of his eyes seem to be
leaking into the whites pinwheels Strange flowers

Octopi

ASSISTANT

Look at his eyes

ASSISTANT 2

Were overdoing the endorphin push
TEAM LEADER
Thats the symbiosis routines in the Rig
Its actually trying to reconfigure his

optical functions

OTTO

Was I was I fighting Spider-Man

Everyone looks around at Spider-Man Spider-Mans not there

Otto sits up They try to help him

OTTO (contd)

Im fine Thank you Im fine Now

get off me

He stands up shaky Brushes off their helping hands

TEAM LEADER

Otto it was too long You stayed in the

Rig too long

OTTO
No the problem is that I didnt stay in
it long enough My system never gets the
chance to reach equilibrium with the

Rigs

They stare at him Is he serious He looks around Sees
the broken light bulb The slashed curtain The shattered

chair He sits down

OTTO (contd)
Maybe I stayed in the rig too long I

dont know

They bring him a glass of water and a clean shirt He accepts

their ministrations

OTTO (contd)
Thank you Thanks a lot Teddy
(concerned)

Are you all right I didnt hurt you

TEAM LEADER

(relieved)
Im fine chief

INT DAVIS AUDITORIUM - BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR

PETER

OTTO
Still one or two--

(twitches his head)
Kinks to work out But basically sound

PETER
Actually Doctor I was hoping to hear

OTTO
Ah Well Unfortunately we lost our
funding for that project Im afraid it
was rather poorly managed And please
call me Otto Any friend of the Osborns
is my friend The Rigs materials and
kinetechnology is all Oscorp design and
build Norman Osborn was a huge
supporter of my work A steady and
generous supporter Not too mention a
true original A man in a world of

mediocrities Hes very sorely missed

At this mention of Norman a shadow clouds Harrys face

So hear youre into spiders

INT AUNT MAYS HOUSE - BEDROOM

Peter steps into the bedroom and closes the door behind him

His eyes dart to a porcelain shepherdess holding up a forty

watt bulb and a gilt-edged shade

There on the shepherdesss bonnet perches a big fat juicy

fly If we could detect such things we would sense that the

fly feels a sudden alarm

INT AUNT MAYS HOUSE - KITCHEN

Aunt May hears the THWING of Spideys webbing and then a
SPLAT

Peter emerges from the bedroom looking satisfied

PETER

Mission accomplished

MAY
Im sorry Peter I know you must think

A beat

PETER
The guy Iran into him A couple of
hours before he shot Uncle Ben He was
robbing this place And I knew it And
I could have stopped him easily But I
let him run right past me Because at

the time it didnt seem like my problem

Shes just looking at him Dry-eyed A little confused

maybe

PETER (contd)
And then like an hour later thats when
Uncle Ben was waiting for me and this guy

went up to him and

She sits a moment longer Then she stands up and takes the

plate of cookies away from him

MAY

Well I guess I can understand how you

didnt want to tell me this

Turns and dumps all the lovely cookies into the trash Quiet
fury

MAY (contd)
I mean on the surface it does seem to

be something fairly unforgivable

PETER

Aunt May

She swings the china plate above her head then brings it

down against the counter It shatters

MAY

Damn it

She crouches stiffly and begins to pick up the pieces Peter

goes to help her but she pushes him away As she tosses

shards into the trash she cuts herself

Pokes her finger into her mouth Peter tries to put his hand
on her shoulder

Peter roars back to the city As he slows in some traffic
the bike begins to backfire and throw sparks Then it
actually bursts into flame Fellow motorists honk at him

One leans out of a passing car

FELLOW MOTORIST

Yo butthead your motorcycle is on fire
Peter scrambles over onto the shoulder Leaps off the
burning bike Contemplates the flames then starts to stamp

them out This quickly devolves into a vicious kicking

PETER
Stupid frigging piece of junk Why
cant I have one thing in my life that

actually works

Fellow motorists slow their cars to watch as Peters spider

strength renders the bike a heap of junk in seconds

PETER (contd)
Cant-- even-- cross town without

bursting into flames-- or being shot at

Peter stands over the corpse of the bike heart POUNDING

Then turns and starts to limp home along the median

Otto lies in a steaming bathtub recuperating from his show

Nice tub good cigar TV flickering in the wall

On the news His performance Video coverage of the

lecture of Otto strutting around the stage

BOY TALKING HEAD
potential applications Octavius said

range from handling nuclear waste to
detonating underwater mines to the

exploration of outer space

GIRL TALKING HEAD
Speaking of creepy crawlies Jim it
seems that Spider-Man is finding New York

to be a very tough town

At the words Spider-Man Otto sits up in the tub He leaps

out dripping and pads over to the television wall

Otto hits the record button on his DVD-R We see several

shelves of DVD archives arranged above the recorder

On TV the incident is reported Jameson is there ranting

We see the headline about the reward Then theres a shot of

Spider-Man scaling a wall

Otto zooms in on it watching with a scientists eye

The girl talking head comes back on

GIRL TALKING HEAD (contd)
It was a scene right out of All About Eve
tonight when a spokesman for Deirdre Dunn
announced that the Broadway star

currently playing the lead in the popular
musical Bride would be taking a

temporary leave of absence for some well

needed rest

Otto pops out the disk fits it into its box scrawls a
label Files it on the shelf We see that it is labelled

SPIDER-MAN 52404

All of the other disks are labelled the same way They go

back for a year

GIRL TALKING HEAD (contd)
Said that the role will be played by

Miss Dunns understudy Mary Jane Watson

Ottos attention is drawn to the screen again MJ is being

interviewed in makeup backstage

MJ (ON TV)
Well this is great opportunity for me

recovery for Deirdre

Ottos gaze remains scientific but somehow softened Towels

off his hair watching MJs lovely face

We pull back and reveal as we do so his four backjacks each

capped with a rubber seal glistening

Oh oh

OTTO

INT ANANSI PROJECT LABORATORY - NIGHT

The darkened laboratory Machines softly interrogate one

another KEY in the door Slash of light

All the lights go on as Otto ushers MJ in She notices the

rig right away It hangs in its dock a malign orchid

MJ

Is that it

Otto is in love with the rig of course The way that a man

might be in love with a ship or a 1971 Chevrolet Barracuda

OTTO

Thats it

She gets that he has feelings for his machine

MJ
Its beautiful
(beat)

Its a little freaky
OTTO
Well Im a little freaky You should

probably know that about me

MJ

Okay

THE RIG

One of its heads The one with a somehow crafty expression

in its staring black sensor

POV - THE RIG

As Otto comes out to MJ

OTTO
Iam not like other people MJ Im not
like anybody youve ever met Freaky
yeah Im a freak of nature I taught
myself calculus when I was nine I was a

chess grandmaster at fifteen I dont
say it as a boast It was hell on earth

Thad to fight every day of my life

MJ

I knew a kid like that

OTTO
But there was always that one pretty girl
who also managed somehow to be nice

Ill bet that was you huh

MJ looks away smiles

THE RIG

Deep in its sensor a diode pulses Now its watching MJ

OTTO (contd)
Today Im all right with it Ive
learned to embrace being a freak I
accept that I was given the gift of
intelligence for a purpose Which is

this thing you see The rig Ottos
Octopus

He goes over to it Takes hold of one of its hands A touch

of the bridegroom

MJ

What does it well do

OTTO

Oh it cuts hair

She laughs

OTTO (contd)
What does it do It improves you It

makes you better

MJ

You mean it makes you stronger

OTTO
Stronger faster yes but also smarter

Much smarter When Im jacked in I feel
like my grasp finally equals my reach I
can feel myself--expanding Not just my
physical grasp but my mind my heart my
soul I feel enlarged by the experience
And it feels right Have you ever felt

anything like that

MJ

I thought so One time

She goes over to the rig Slowly extends her fingers toward
the nearest head As her fingers draw nearer the diode
pulses and we begin to fear for the fate of her fingers Her

fingertips touch-- the eye goes dark

MJ (contd)

When you say jack

OTTO
There are four shunts that interface
directly with my central nervous system

I wear it But its also wearing me
He reaches up and takes hold of the latch with its spirit

level bubble

OTTO (contd)
This is the neural integrity seal The

latch basically

MJ

Does it hurt

OTTO
The system delivers a steady dose of pain
blocking endorphins the whole time Im in
it Which so far has never been longer
than a few hours The goal is a
permanent interface Of course the idea
of a permanent humanmachine integration

makes some people uneasy

Granted MJs looking a little uneasy Otto fingers the

Latch

OTTO (contd)
The Rig is designed to seek to implement
a systems merger with the host
Unfortunately so far my flimsy human
tissues not up to the challenge Not

yet Were working on that

MJ is freaked and fascinated

MJ

So you have like holes In your

back Permanent ones

OTTO

Want to see them

Daring her a little bit

MJ

Not really but yes

He turns Unbuttons his shirt Lowers it Four black

glinting discs in his back Freaky but beautiful

The domed building where it all began for Peter
A shadow from the shadows leaps onto the domes Its Peter

INT SCIENCE BUILDING - NIGHT

The great central hall Its deserted and dim He walks

around Hears echoes of that afternoon a year ago

The spider cages are empty

He looks down at his hand where the spider bit him rubs it

Thoughtful then his face breaks He sits down buries his

face in his hands Chokes up

A WHIRR he looks up TINGLING

INT ANANSI PROJECT LABORATORY - NIGHT

Peter creeps down the hall just outside We HEAR the

unmistakable WHIRR of the rig

SERIES OF SHOTS - COUPLING THE RIG

1) Otto lowers the Rig into position
2) The Rig watches expressionless

3) Otto steps into the Rig Engages the coupler A WHINE of

hydraulics

Otto reaches back to twist the Latch Cant quite see what

his fingers are doing

His fingers cant reach Cant reach He strains grunting

Gives up Starts to press the decoupler Then--

--a ‘pod reaches in for the Latch and TWISTS IT

Otto flinches then lets go as blessed relief floods his

features Sinking in The irises of his eyes spiral out

One of the pods reaches toward his face and tenderly

strokes it with steely finger

Peter watching GASPS

The pods hone in on the sound at once quivering Otto
looks over

OTTO

Whos there

Peter steps out of the shadows

OTTO (contd)

Parker

PETER

OTTO
(rattled)

What the hell are you doing here

PETER
I wanted to talk to you But I see

youre--what are you doing

OTTO

It helps me relax

INT ANANSI PROJECT LABORATORY - NIGHT

Peter sits across a desk from Otto One pod puts on a CD
Two others are busy pouring two cans of Coke Peter eyes the

‘pods warily Otto taps at the keyboard of his computer

OTTO
The viral delivery system we were using

in the superspider project

PETER

Thats right

Otto hits a few more keys

OTTO
Thats why you came here

PETER

What other reason would there be

Otto shrugs

OTTO
Here Yes we were using a modified
arbovirus Highly infectious in spiders
We replaced the nucleonic RNA with
whatever we wanted to code for and the

virus did the rest

PETER

Is this arbovirus infectious in humans

OTTO
It could be If we had wanted to
introduce spider material into a human I
suppose we could just have just gotten

one of the little critters to bite--
Staring at Peter Understanding without knowing

PETER

What

POV - THE RIG

It watches Peter and Otto pulsing softly

OTTO

Why do you want to know

PETER

Im just curious

As Peter says these words

They are processed by the suit it subjects them to a

VISUAL VOICE-STRESS ANALYSIS

The pattern is scanned and designated COUNTERFACTUAL
AN INDICATOR

begins to blink on one of the pods

AT OTTOS WORKSTATION

The ROUTER begins to blink in kind

ON THE MONITOR

PETER

No not a friend--

OTTO

PETER

Not much Kind of a quiet guy

OTTO

Know if he was ever bitten by a spider

PETER

He might have been I wouldnt know

OTTO
We lost a spider If by chance it bit
him Is that what happened And
transferred the viral genotrope in its

venom

Hes advancing on Peter now The pods billow and arc
OTTO (contd)
Thats great Its a conceptual

breakthrough

PETER
Not to him it isnt Hes sick of it
Thats why I came to see you To see if

theres any way to--

OTTO

Why didnt he just come himself

PETER
Huh Oh because Hes uh horribly
disfigured Up close Thats why he
wears the mask
(shudders)
Its like he has these little hairs all
over him and compound eyeballs And the

smell

OTTO
Unfortunate No way to control the

process I suppose relying on a bite
(beat)

He could probably use one of these

eventually

He reaches into a tray behind him Holds up a tiny ziplock
bag with a speck inside Peter leans in to look A tiny bit

of circuitry--a spider-mite of silicon

PETER

What is it

OTTO
Its basically an immune system on a
chip You seed it with a sample of the
material you want to defend against and
it pumps out antigens I call ita

parity chip

PETER

Parity
OTTO
Equilibrium The Rig is so powerfully
integrative that right now it overwhelms
my own systems Im hoping to use this
to boost my bodys immunity In theory
your friend could seed this with some of
his own spiderized DNA implant it and
knock out the genes that are coding for

his spider traits

He tosses the chip back onto the tray

OTTO (contd)

This is just a prototype Were not in

fab yet

Peter regards the tray the little baggie There it is His

salvation His eyes stray up to

AN AIRVENT IN CEILING

Conveniently located just over the tray
OTTO

PETER

Oh Yeah I know

Then he picks up the chip with a clasp Smears the tissue

against the chip Drops it into the tube

Holds up the BIG NEEDLE Jeez Pokes it down into the tube

and draws in the fluid The chip is sucked in along with it

He stares into the whirling fluid in the syringe

In its swirl

1) Spider-Man careens like a maniac through Greater Manhattan

airspace

2) Peter Parker sits despondent in Ottos laboratory head in

his hands

3) He crouches at the side of Ben Parker watching him die

PETER
You dont know what its like Uncle Ben
You dont know how it feel to be such a
freak of nature Okay with great power

But you know what comes with no power

No worries No guilt No freak show

With his free hand he pours a shot of vodka Tosses it back

tiny dimple under the skin

He checks himself out in the mirror Strong Fit No
visible difference He frowns then leaps up into the air
Completes a half-flip and sticks feet first against the

ceiling Damn

He dresses with care buttoning his neat civilian clothes

Then he goes to the closet Crouches down opens a panel in

picture of Wolverine Unzips it

The red and blue suit neatly folded

EXT FAR BROOKLYN - VACANT LOT - DAWN

standing alone

The suitcase CLANGS against the inside of the drum Peter

takes out a can of lighter fluid

Douses the thing liberally then strikes a match HUGE

STUPIDLY HUGE FIREBALL

Peter leaps to one side Kicks over the drum Flame

scatters everywhere He jumps around trying to stamp them

out Faraway LAUGHTER from the men

Peter picks up still-intact suitcase
PETER

Ouch

He shakes the costume out of the smoldering case

Picks it up off the ground stares at it The dead eyes of

the mask stare back

He stuffs the thing into the steel drum and walks away Does

not look especially unburdened

EXT VACANT LOT - ANOTHER VIEW

He tacks a little unsteadily across the lot toward the drum

frowns He creeps up the wall and onto the ceiling Hangs

there Drops onto the floor Not yet

and arrest his fall

He rights himself blushing No one has noticed but us He

takes a bite

OTTO (contd)

Its a very good hot dog

MJ

I really needed it

OTTO
Im sorry the shows not getting any

MJ

Youre sort of gaga over me arent you

OTTO (contd)

Hey watch it man

The BBM ignores him Otto starts after with those freaky

octopus eyes
MJ

Otto

Otto seems to rise up weirdly looming

OTTO

I dont know why human beings persist in

believing that mere physical bulk confers

some sort of evolutionary advantage

The BBM feels a tap on his shoulder Its a pod natch

MAN

Yeah

The pods snake out around Otto fatal and alert

On MJ

She looks fully as if the flesh of the guy that shes sort of

getting a crush on has suddenly sprouted four steel arms
Otto and the faithful Rig make short work of the two men

Otto turns back to MJ hanging in the air Aglow with the

work out Hurricane eyes SIRENS in the distance

OTTO

We wanted to show you what we are

EXT STREETCORNER - ANOTHER VIEW

Peter is watching from a distance as Otto bursts out into

strange bloom

PETER

Oh oh

Starts to run toward them Then stops Looks around Sees

EXCELSIOR SOUVENIR SHOP

He dashes in and looks around Finds a Spider-Man replica t

shirt Grabs it and a Big Apple ski mask Runs out of the

shop with the SHOPOWNER running after him
As he runs he pulls on the long-sleeved T-shirt and mask

EXT STREETCORNER - ON OTTO AND MJ

The arms retract and Otto comes to her his clothing in

tatters She backs away Turns Tries to run

A ‘pod lazily retrieves her Whips her around

OTTO
(plural voice)

Look at us

She meets his gaze He looks tenderly at her SIREN getting

louder

OTTO (contd)
(normal voice)

Youre so lovely

The fingertip of the ‘pod strokes her cheek with the same

tenderness Ick
MJ

Get away from me

She tries to duck free of the ‘pod He wont let go

SPIDER-MAN (OS)

Let go of her

Otto turns Sees Peter standing there Laughs

OTTO

Were out of candy kid Youll have to

TP the house

SPIDER-MAN

Put her down

He flies at Otto Otto sidesteps him and reinforcing his

grip on MJ starts to flee up the side of a building On top

of the building they start to fight

A leaping pursuit across the rooftops Elevated tracks in
the distance On the next to last rooftop before the tracks

Otto turns The fight begins

Its not a fair fight Otto his hampered by holding MJ

Otto looks at MJ reproach in his eyes Then he sets her

gently down And leaps over to the next building

Spider-Man goes to MJ She shakes his arm

MJ

Go get him Please Hes not bad

Peter peers at her through the eyeholes of the ski mask

PETER

Do youDo you love him

MJ
Hes my friend Hes angry And
dangerous Please Spider-Man Dont

let him hurt himself
Spider-Man nods And goes after Otto Chases him across the

last rooftop before the tracks Otto hesitates on the ledge

Spider-Man flies at him headfirst HITS and they both tumble

over the side of the building

TRAIN SEQUENCE (TR)

They fall onto the elevated tracks that run alongside the

building

A train is passing at that moment They smash down onto the

top of it and are carried along the rushing tracks

Otto rights himself Gets to his feet

OTTO

Im ready Come on

Spidey rises and then its basically a five mile long version
of King of the Hill at high speed Or maybe the myth of
Sisyphus Otto digs at the head of the car and Spidey comes

after him And Otto throws him off and Spidey comes after
him

Every time he falls off the train something worse happens to
Spider-Man than the time before Its brutal But he always

climbs back on

At one point Spidey manages to get right onto Ottos back
He gets his hand in at the root of the pods and grabs hold
of the Latch Pulls on it It SNAPS and swings free Still
attached But useless And Otto HURLS him off the train

Spidey climbs back on

After the Latch busts Otto just keeps getting stronger But

we notice that Spidey seems to be tiring Hes winded

So it makes Otto angry that Spidey keeps on coming He
knocks Spidey off again and then smashes in the window of

the car beneath his feet reaches in with his pods

He starts yanking people right out and tossing them to the
side Spider-Man snares them all in webs The last time

his webbing SPUTTERS before it fires
Finally Otto rips the controls right out of the car Then he

jumps off the train Spider-Man wants to go after him

But the train is now hurtling out of control He cant just

leave it

He stays And its a good thing because a big L-bend in the
tracks is coming up And the train is going much too fast to

take the turn

Spider-Man manages to get all the passengers evacuated to the

rear half of the train

Then he gets behind the first three cars (now empty) right
in down between and cuts the lead ones loose Gives them a
mighty push They race ahead smash through the guard rail

and PLUNGE over the side of the elevated

Now Spider-Man has to stop the part with the PASSENGERS He
jumps down in front of the car thats now the lead Plants
his legs against the speeding track itself Railroad ties

SNAP-SNAP-SNAP and the momentum slows But not enough
Finally web SPUTTERING at the very limit of his strength
Spider-Man strings his own body between buildings with
webbing making himself into the focus of a giant slingshot

with all those tons of train shoving right up against him

And the train slows And slows And slows And stops The

Passengers CHEER

Utterly spent his makeshift costume tattered gaping holes

in his mask Spider-Man hangs over the abyss clinging to the

edge held in place by the tension of his webbing against the

bulk of the train behind him And then--

AT HIS WRISTS

The webbing gives out For good The spinnerets FOAM OVER

like emptied aerosol cans

He hangs suspended for a moment Then falls--

And is caught by the Passengers Leaning out of the front

windows of the train
They drag him back in and lay him on the floor His mask is

so torn and stretched that you can see more than half his

face

The passengers look down at him Then AN OLDER MAN reaches

down and tugs the mask back over Spidermans face Looks up

at the others Anybody got a problem with my doing that

Nobody does

INT ANANSI PROJECT LABORATORY - NIGHT

Otto stumbles back into the lab Hes crying He backs into

the coupler and activates it It advances to a certain point

and then stalls Tries it again nothing

His hand reaches for the Latch Its loose he remembers in

FLASHBACK - FIGHT

As Spider-Man BUSTS the latch while trying to decouple Otto

PRESENT MOMENT - LAB
A glinting black pod joins his hand on the Latch They are
together forever now A look on Ottos face of inexpressible

rapture or possibly unbearable pain He sinks to the ground

and using laser instruments Its a complicated ballet of
machinery and surgeons and blood The ANESTHESIOLOGIST

monitors the EKG

Unless we kill him first by trying to

remove it
The pace of the EKG ratchets up a notch

ANESTHESIOLOGIST

I may need to give him a little more So

are we going to do this or not

The doctors look at each other

DOCTOR 3

All right Come on

The Anesthesiologist prepares to turn up the gas on Otto

One of the ‘pods stirs faintly Unobserved Its diode

pulses Takes in the situation

The surgeons take up their instruments

From the pseudpod a soft WHIRR as we travel down

INTO THE POD ITSELF
Into its systems Impulses sent to a fabrication unit A
complicated organic molecule takes rapid shape then a dozen

more like it and we follow them back out of the fab

The molecules are pumped directly into another system
Ottos nervous system Up the spine toward the brain A
soft feminine VOICE wells up muffled Almost sounds like

its saying Wake up Otto

OTTOS BODY

We travel up along his hips and chest through his neck and

up to

HIS EYES

They snap open

OTTO

Im awake

With a ROAR he comes to life The ‘pods windmill and lash

and flail A tornado or turbine
Within moments Otto stands surrounded by bodies Hes

bleeding himself

The servo of a pseudopod TRILLS softly The other pods

gather near it and turn their attention as one on Otto

Darting flexing the pods go to work on Ottos wounds One
cleans with a swab One secretes an ointment One radiates
a healing light And one pours him a glass of brandy He

knocks it back Sighs

OTTO (contd)

All right System report

He appears to be LISTENING to a voice in his head a soft

feminine MURMUR we can almost make out Winces

OTTO (contd)
Jesus thats disgusting How long do we
have
(listening)

Im going to have to try the parity chip
He goes over to the tray Of course its not there

OTTO (contd)
Spider-Man He stole it--or Parker
stole it for him
(listens)

No no time to fab a new one

His VOICE thickens as he shift to the plural as if another

strand had been woven into it

OTTO (contd)
We need to find another means of

attaining system equilibrium

Otto opens one of the X-doctors portable lockers Stacked

with their rubberized scrub-jumpsuits Holds it up Yes it

The truck crashes against a lamppost and splits open A
bicycle chained to the lamppost goes flying and lands with a
clatter Peter lies amid spools of cable and orange plastic

fencing He stands up shakily

Now a HELICOPTER descends on the intersection Squad cars

arrive from every direction

One of the ‘pods snakes up and grabs hold of the choppers
strut Another reaches right into the whirl of the
helicopters rotors His ‘pod takes hold of the rotor shaft
and with a horrible shrieking brings it to a halt Then Ock

hurls the chopper directly at the police cars
Watching the explosion grinning he retreats He doesnt

Then LOOTERS fall on the Sikh man

Peter drops the bike and runs into the midst of the gang

They turn on him The Sikh man crawls out of the melee
bleeding The looters swell around Peter kicking stomping

punching He goes down under the surf of men

Then with an audible WHOOSH the gang of looters FLIES
BACKWARD Its like a blossom blooming Peter rises to his
feet bloodied but steady The men come at him again but now

he makes short work of them leaping kicking dancing

this moment I suppose before anything
else youd like to know who put your

father in the ground

Harry draws closer fascinated He nods MJ hangs back

Otto reaches out and YANKS the mask off of Peter

HARRYS FACE

Horror The memory of Peter and his father shaking hands

Of Spider-Man leaving the corpse of Norman Osborn Masks
begin to circle one another in his mind--the masks of Norman
Osborns collection Spider-Mans mask--and one other green

and grinning

She runs toward the table A ‘pod lashes out and knocks her
brutally aside Harry goes to her sees the blood on her

cheek
Looks back at Peter lying on the table as a great spiked
vascular probe begins to descend on the torn form of his

friend

The LAUGHTER begins to sound louder in his ear and the probe

descends

HARRY

No This isnt-- Im not--

He stumbles to his feet stoned and terrified and lurches

out of the laboratory

Ock swings another fell-looking unit into place near Peters
head All of the ‘pods are working in balletic unison to

prepare the procedure

MJ stands She sees a big spanner lying on the ground

Picks it up Tucks it behind her back Starts to inch

toward Otto

MJ
Otto Dont do this You dont want to

do this

OTTO
Theres no way to avoid it We only need
pieces of him really but theyre rather

crucial pieces

Shes coming closer to Otto

OTTO (contd)

If we could take what we needed without

killing him we would but alas--

He flips a few more controls

Two of the ‘pods zero in on Peters head One extrudes foam

onto it The other produces a clipper-head

With a few rapid strokes they shave Peter bald

OTTO (contd)

No thats not true Were looking
forward to this death You know whats
interesting Humans always think of the
killer instinct as something very

primitive A relic of the savage past

Now all the cruel apparatuses are in place An urchin of
steel spines miniature ‘pods wriggle toward Peters bare

skull

OTTO (contd)
But the longer we spend at this level of
evolution the more we realize that
thats just wrong Think about it
Human beings have only gotten better and
better at killing over the last fifty
thousand years This is what were

evolving toward

Shes close enough now She raises the wrench high and

brings it down--

ZWIPP A ‘pod lashes around the wrench and jerks it from her

hand Another ‘pod knocks her back against the wall
OTTO (contd)
(plural voice)

Get away from Otto bitch

Ock turns on her and the pods lash out and hover just

above her ready to cut her to ribbons

MJ

Otto please

She climbs unsteadily to her feet Looking him in the eye

MJ (contd)
Otto hey Look at me Please Just

look at me

She crosses to him The arms strike and come within inches
of her face She flinches but doesnt give way Then takes
another step toward him Reaches up Lifts the glasses

Peers into his wild dying eyes

MJ (contd)
I know that youre in there I can feel

you Can you feel me

The arms WHIRR and twitch impatient as hounds at the end of

their leash

OTTO

Yes MJ I can feel you

MJ
Otto you are not a killer Your work is
not about killing Your work is about
making us better humans right Better

at being human

OTTO
Better at surviving in this poisonous

world

MJ
Why Why survive Just for the sake of

surviving
Otto points at Peter with a meat hand

OTTO

You love him

MJ

Yes Ido

Ottos at the limit of his control All his systems breaking

down The WHIRR of the arms ratchets up to a WHINE

OTTO
I thought there was a place for me in
your heart The first place I ever felt

like I belonged

Distant sound of SIRENS from outside

MJ

There is Otto There is a place For

you For me There is

OTTO
You might be right There might be

Slowly the pods snake up toward the rafters of old

building Lash around them Pull tight

OTTO (contd)

collapse in on themselves

INT NORMANS OSBORNES PENTHOUSE - DAY

Harry Osborn lies in the middle of the floor of a great

empty ballroom floor A small dark island in a sea of

parquet

He wakes up like Sal Mineo in Rebel Without a Cause alone

lost abandoned

Stands up Looks around Echoes and ghosts

He wanders the empty rooms and halls Draped furniture

Carpets rolled
Climbs the stairs Stops at the door to his fathers office

Hesitates Goes in Theres nothing there except--

Something in the corner A small piece of colored paper

He goes over and picks it up Its a little store-bought
Halloween card More ghosts HAVE A BOO-TIFUL HALLOWEEN

Opens it up To Dad Love Harry He lets it drop

NORMAN OSBORNE (OS)

All right Harry Its your turn now

Harry looks around sharply No one there

NORMAN OSBORNE (OS) (contd)
I want to see what kind of stuff youre

made of

HARRY

No No Dad Hes my friend

He looks into the mirror over the mantlepiece Norman is

there
NORMAN OSBORNE
Is he Your friend I guess thats why
he stole your girlfriend I guess thats

why he killed me

HARRY
Dad I dont know Im not sure

Theres a lot I dont understand

NORMAN OSBORNE
I dont know Im not sure Harry
you swore an oath You put your word
your money your name on the line You
swore to make Spider-Man pay Now make

him pay

Harrys leaning his forehead against the mirror It reflects

only him

HARRY

I swear I swear
As he says this he POUNDS the mirror with his fist It
shatters and falls Droplets of glass rain down And there
on the other side of the universe is a neat little room A

laboratory of some kind A command center A haunt

Harry steps into that other world Hanging from a hook is a

grinning green mask He reaches toward it

INT MJS APARTMENT - DAY

MJ lies on the couch Her leg in a really big cast Reading

the Daily Bugle

THE HEADLINE

WACKOS ONE DOWN ONE TO GO

She reaches for a squeeze bottle that is just out of reach

MJ

Peter Peter I cant reach the--

She falls back against the sofa

MJ (contd)

You said youd stay

PETER

PETER
Ido love you I have loved you all my
life Mary Jane Watson I just cant

uncertainty The hatred I cant ask

He nods toward the Bugle

PETER (contd)

Whats he saying

MJ

Hes saying youre evil incarnate

Peter nods

PETER

Tll call you tomorrow

He goes out She picks up the paper Her face crumples

She puts the paper down Sees his CAMERA sitting there

Lumbering in pain she pulls herself to her feet Grabs her
crutch Hobbles over to pick up the camera Then as quickly
as she can to the window Throws it open Snow blows in

She sticks her head out

MJ

Peter You forgot your camera
Hes on the street below He turns and looks up She
lumbers out onto her balcony We can see the divots that Doc

Ock tore out of the face of the building

MJ forms a quick resolve Then throws herself over the side

PETER

MJ

He darts under the balcony and catches her awkwardly but

sure

MJ
Do you know how amazing it is than I can
trust you do that
(beat)
You were given a gift Peter I want to
share that gift with you And I want you
to share it with me You dont have to

do it alone Ill help you

PETER
MJ--

MJ
What you think police officers dont get
to be in love Firefighters dont get to

be married Thats crazy

PETER
But MJ This is just--this is just so

much weirder than being a policeman

MJ
It is weird
(beat)
But youve always been weird Peter

Parker

PETER

Wait did you say married

She hits him hard

MJ
I already know your damn secret identity

He looks at her Then around Then he carries her over to
the building and lightly with just the tips of his feet
walks right up it Hops the balcony and ducks inside with

her

MJ (OS) (contd)
Does this mean I get to see the Spider

Cave

PETER (0S)

There is no Spider-Cave

MJs (OS)

That sucks

INT MJS APARTMENT - NIGHT

He sets her back down on the couch Puts down his knapsack

Then SIRENS A lot of SIRENS Peter goes to the window and

looks out Face grim Well you asked for it
MJ

Go Go Ill be fine

He starts to peel off his shirt

EXT NEW YORK STREET — NIGHT

The sky glows orange flashing sirens Spider-Man takes off
into the night MJ leans out of the balcony as he sails away

to be who he is

MJ

You forgot your camera

Spider-Man swings around a corner and straight through the

heart of a burning building

PETER (VO)
It was a five alarm fire Gas fed 300
firefighters And the junior Senator

from New York on the seventh floor

He comes swinging out the other side clutching a
DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN and a YOUNG WOMAN DRESSED AS A
MAID

PETER (VO) (contd)

With his lovely companion

He touches them down gently ERT techs rush over

PETER (VO) (contd)
Look at that guy Look at him You want
to know the story of his life No choice

in the matter No way out

Spider-Man sails back up into the roaring fire toward a PAIR
OF CHILDREN snatching them from the flames Doing what he

was meant to do

PETER (contd)

Didnt get a single damn picture of any

of it

THE END
