BRENT (CONTD)
Run run run jump jump run
run jump

ON THE BOWL as it continues on its path of destruction
through Sardine Circle and people run SCREAMING

THE BOWL bounces through a parking lot exploding a car which
propels the bowl up in the air and throws Shamo through the
flaming hoop and towards the ocean and freedom

SHAMO
(GURGLY) Yippee

Then he’s immediately SNATCHED UP by a flying ratbird

Then the bowl falls back to the ground landing upside-down
on top of Flint and Steve trapping them inside

THROUGH THE GLASS BOWL Flint sees all the destruction he
caused

shoes epidemic What are they made
of some kind of elastic bio-
polymer adhesive

Music plays as Flint gets all dreamy

FLINT

Welcome Flint

Wow You seriously spend a lot of
time alone

FLINT
What (AWKWARD LAUGHING)

INT FLINTS LAB - MOMENTS LATER
Flint shows Sam a diagram of the machine

FLINT
So here’s how it works Water goes
in the top and food comes out the
bottom

SAM
So when you shot it up into the
stratosphere you figured it would
induce a molecular phase change of
the vapor from the cumulonimbus
layer

FLINT
That’s actually a really smart
observation

SAM
(SUDDENLY NERVOUS) I mean the
clouds probably have water in them
which I guess is why you shot it up
there in the first place

FLINT
(SUDDENLY NERVOUS) Right right
That’s why I did thaton purpose

SAM
Right yeah

FLINT
Right

Both LAUGH AWKWARDLY and Flint backs out of frame
CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 33

INT FLINTS LAB - MOMENTS LATER

Flint points to a diagram of water molecules forming into
hexagons from radiation waves

FLINT
The machine uses a principal of
hydro-genetic mutation Water
molecules are bombarded with
microwave radiation which mutates
their genetic recipe into any kind
of food you want

SAM
So pizza

Yes

Mashed potatoes

FLINT

absence of any ceiling

TIM
So no roof

FLINT
Yup You just hold out your plate
And I even made it rain your
favorite meat Mmmmm

Tim looks around the room as -- CLANK CLANK CLANK -- large
steaks hit the tables all around them rattling silverware
Everyone else enjoys it but Tim is a bit freaked out

FLINT (CONTD)
Okay So you know how the grand
reopening of the town is tomorrow
Well the mayor has asked me to cut
the ribbon He said my invention
saved the town Aren’t you proud
of me

Tim looks torn Then-- SLAM A large steak lands Tim’s
plate STARTLING him He looks down at it He looks at
Flint who’s still celebrating arms in the air and doesn’t
want to have to burst Flint’s balloon

TIM
Well Doesn’t this steak look a
little big to you

FLINT
Yeah it’s a big steak Every
steak is not exactly the same size
Did you even hear what I just said

WHAM Another big steak lands between them knocking their
glassware off the table

A THREE-FOOT LONG HOT DOG plops down in front of Flint He
looks around to see several other large hotdogs around his
neighborhood including his dad’s yard which is full of
hotdogs

FLINT (CONTD)
These are big hotdogs

He looks up to the clouds grave

INT FLINT’S LAB - MOMENTS LATER

Flint looks at a scanner with a huge HOT DOG in it
CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 59

FLINT
Oh man (DEEP BREATH) I mean this
isn’t that bad is it Steve

Steve has smeared mustard on his face and hands

STEVE
Yellow

Flint goes over to the Dangometer which is in the yellow

FLINT
Youre right Steve The
Dangometer is in the yellow I
don’t know what to do

He hears a WHIRRING SOUND and turns to see
MAYOR
I do declare these hot dogs to

be delicious

The Mayor now GROTESQUELY FAT riding in from the shadows on
a RASCAL SCOOTER and munching on a HOT DOG piled with FOOD

FLINT
(FREAKED OUT SOUND)
STEVE
Whoa
Steve runs away
FLINT

How did you get in here

MAYOR
Tomorrow’s the big day Flint The
entire town’s fate is resting on
your food-weather I’m thinking
pasta Some light apps I know
you won’t let us down

He wheels back into the shadows still staring at him
FLINT
Well Mr Mayor I think there’s
something you should see

The mayor returns

MAYOR
What
CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 60

Flint leads the mayor over to the scanner and pulls up a
display on the computer monitor

FLINT
This is the molecular structure of
a hot dog that fell last week And
this is the molecular structure of
a hot dog that fell today

He pushes a button revealing a very scary looking rapidly
moving group of molecules

FLINT (CONTD)
The machine uses microwave
radiation to mutate the genetic
recipe of the food The more we
ask it to make the more clouds it
takes in the more radiation it
emits the more these food
molecules could over-mutate I
think that’s why the food is
getting bigger

MAYOR

Here’s what I heard blah blah
blah science science science
bigger And bigger is better
Everyone’s gonna love these new
portion sizes

He shoves the entire hot dog in his mouth and swallows it

MAYOR (CONTD)
(MOUTH FULL) I know I do

Flint looks over to the button unsure

FLINT
My dad thinks I should turn it
off

MAYOR

Geniuses like us are never
understood by their fathers Flint

FLINT
But what if things go--

The Mayor starts circling FLint

MAYOR
Who needs the approval of one
family member when you can have it
from millions of acquaintances
(MORE )
CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 61

MAYOR (CONTD)

Not to mention that little cutlet
Sam Sparks and me I’ve always
felt you were like a son to me
Flint And I’m going to be so
proud of you tomorrow when you cut
that ribbon save the town and
prove to everybody what a great
inventor you are So here’s the
cheese You can keep it going get
everything you’ve ever wanted and
be the great man I know you can be
Or you can turn it off ruin
everything and no one will ever
like you It’s your choice

Tight on Flint’s eyes thinks about this The word ‘choice’
echoes in his mind -- except not really as we reveal

MAYOR (CONTD)
(WHISPERING) Choice choice
choice

Then--

FLINT
(DEEP BREATH) Okay

IN THE REFLECTION OF THE MONITOR Flint approaches and the

SOUNDTRACK and moving like a kid pretending to be an action
hero He accidentally steps on a tortilla chip CRUNCH
alerting the machine to his presence
CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 96

Immediately the top half of the uvula lifts the FLDSMDFR up
and it fires a GIANT CORN at Flint

MACHINE VOICE
Corn

The corn rips into the ground in front of him digging a huge
crater in the spot where Flint was just standing

The machine noses forward still attached to the uvula and
uses a beam of light to scan the room for Flint -- he’s
nowhere to be found

The light beam passes over a row of food embedded in one of
the walls -- strawberries hot dogs pickles -- nothing
Except -- that’s not a hot dog it’s Flint in a bun

But the machine doesn’t see him and the uvula returns it to
the gelatinous column to continue pumping food around the
world

Flint slips out of the bun and inside a cocktail olive and

runs over to a corner He grabs items as he goes -- a strand
of spaghetti a shrimp -- and ties them tightly together

donut hanging from the ceiling and the tail of the shrimp
hooks in

Flint times it so the machine has just “exhaled” then swings
out on the spaghetti strand

Swinging

-wrapping it around the uvula like a tetherball so that the
machine can’t suck in any clouds

Flint lands right next to the machine and immediately pulls
out his cell phone with the kill code
CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS 97

FLINT (CONTD)
Sorry old friend The kitchen’s
closed

He jams the phone into the machine’s port But instead of
the kill code it turns out Tim sent him the CAT DJ VIDEO

FLINT (CONT’D)
Dad no

Suddenly the uvula rears up snapping the spaghetti lifting
the FLDSMDFR and Flint has to hang on for dear life as the
machine becomes a bucking bronco flailing wildly and
shooting food in all directions

Flint slips barely holding onto one of the legs of the
machine as he dangles above the huge pit

The FLDSMDFR sucks in clouds until the uvula looks like a
giant balloon filling the most of the cave and prepares to
unload on Flint

He looks down at the hole and notices his feet still covered
-- at always -- in the indestructible Spray-On Shoes His
eyes go WIDE

Flint pulls out his can of SPRAY-ON SHOES

Of spray-on shoes Yeah
