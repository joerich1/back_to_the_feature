INT JFK AIRPORT TERMINAL DEPARTURES -- NIGHT

A HARRIED WOMAN in her 60s runs through the crowded
terminal her belly jiggling She carries no luggage

She reaches a bank of monitors and finds a flight number

HARRIED WOMAN
Okay it hasnt left yet Matt
You still have plenty of time

MATT (30s) shuffles up behind her eyes half-lidded
dragging his carry-on

MATT
I know Mom Because I have a watch

He shows her his wrist to prove it Matt hasnt shaved in
a week and may have slept in his clothes but that doesnt
stop married women from craning their necks as he passes

HARRIED WOMANMATTS MOM
I just dont want you to miss your
flight Is that a crime

MATT
No it isnt Thanks for looking

(kisses her cheek)
Now get back to the car Dads
waiting

MATTS MOM
Ill just see you to the gate

She starts toward the check-in line Matt follows

MATT
They wont let you through security
without a boarding pass

MATTS MOM
But Im your mother

A YOUNG MOTHER and her 10-year-old DAUGHTER reach the end
of the line at the same time as Matt and his Mom The
little girl steps right in front of Matt oblivious

YOUNG MOTHER
Laney this man was here first

MATT
Its fine dont worry about it

YOUNG MOTHER
Oh are you sure Thank you
Shes so frenetic and disorganized its easy to overlook
how stunning she is Until she smiles

As she turns back to her little girl Matts Mom gives
Matt an encouraging nudge He rolls his eyes

MATTS MOM
Are you coming back for Christmas

MATT
Well see

Matt can feel his Moms stare as the line inches forward
MATT (CONTD)
Well see Mom Come on you know
how much I hate this flight --
five hours crammed in an aluminum
deathtrap with a bunch of

He sneers at the crush of humanity all around them

MATT (CONTD)
--people

Matts Mom studies the Young Mother ahead of them
MATTS MOM
(sotto sing-song)

Shes not wearing a riii-ing

MATT
Shhh

The Young Mother and her daughter step up to the counter
Matts Mom taps the wedding band on his hand

MATTS MOM
Why are you still wearing yours

Matt just looks at her This again

MATTS MOM (CONTD)
Matt stop punishing yourself
Its time you got out there -- and
youre not going to meet someone
new wearing that thing

MATT
Even with you as my wingman

She smacks him on the behind and kisses his cheek
MATTS MOM
Get a seat next to her and have a

safe flight I love you

She heads for the exit
MATT
Love you too

MATTS MOM
Then come home for Christmas

Matt steps up to the counter sticks his credit card into
the e-ticket kiosk and starts the automated check-in

The Young Mother and her kid are at the next kiosk over
Shes punching buttons but the screen is frozen

An AIRLINE REP is tagging luggage behind the counter
YOUNG MOTHER
Excuse me this machine ate my
credit card I got our boarding
passes but then --

AIRLINE REP
Ill be with you in just a minute

YOUNG MOTHER
But we have to get to our gate

Nevertheless the Airline Rep walks away on some task

YOUNG MOTHER (CONTD)
Dammit

Matt retrieves his own boarding pass and credit card from
his machine and picks up his carry-on

But he pauses to reach behind the Young Mothers kiosk
and pull the plug The screen goes black

YOUNG MOTHER (CONTD)
Hey what are you doing

Matt plugs the machine back in

MATT
When in doubt try a hard reboot

The screen lights up again and the credit card is ejected

YOUNG MOTHER
Oh my God thank you

But Matt is already walking away

CUT TO

INT FLIGHT 209 FIRST CLASS CABIN -- NIGHT

A sluggish line of tourists and business travelers files
through the jetway and down the narrow aisle of the
airplane their rolling suitcases BANGING into --
Matts knee Hes slumped down in his first row seat
Every time he tries to get back to his tech magazine
somebody steps on his foot or bumps his arm

Matt tosses the magazine aside stands up and moves over
to the empty window seat beside him

But he doesnt sit down yet He just stands there hovering
over the leather upholstery because --

The stream of boarding passengers appears to have ended
He watches the empty cabin door for a moment untrusting

The GRAY-HAIRED BUSINESSMAN in the opposite window seat
smiles at him from behind his Wall Street Journal

From his standing position Matt can see everyone in the
small first class cabin

A FROSTY MODEL TYPE hides behind oversized sunglasses and
stares out the window bored

A FOOTBALL PLAYER in a Stanford jacket reads Skymall

A couple of tech types chatter about business -- two YOUNG
GUNS who just made a deal in the Big Apple

Through the open passageway Matt can see into coach -- a
murmuring zoo of people crammed into tight seats

Matt settles back down in his preferred aisle seat and
picks up his magazine As he leans against his armrest --

Someone RAMS a bag into the back Matts head Its the
Young Mother from the ticket counter coming up from coach

YOUNG MOTHER
Im so sorry Are you okay

Matt rubs his head as she takes the seat across from him

MATT
Ill live

YOUNG MOTHER
I saw these empty seats up here
and figured hey its not like
Im using those miles to go to
Paris anytime soon right

MATT
Get yourself some free champagne
Well speak French and pretend

Young Mother smiles Her daughter -- LANEY -- comes up
the aisle clutching a pillow and stuffed elephant
YOUNG MOTHER
Right there Laney You get the
window seat

The little girl climbs over Matt He gives her a wave and
turns right back to her mother Yep shes beautiful

Matt glances at his wedding band and slides it off

MATT
So can I buy you a free drink

YOUNG MOTHER
I think I owe you one Im Marianne

MATT
Matt

They shake but she looks down at his left hand
YOUNG MOTHERMARIANNE
Um werent you wearing a ring

like ten minutes ago

Busted Matt looks at his ringless finger

MATT

Yeah Ima My wife passed on
MARIANNE

Oh Im so sorry

But you can tell she doesnt really believe him

MATT
Well it uh thanks

Blew it Matt drops the effort and settles back in his
seat to find Laney staring at him

LANEY
Yeah shes a MILF

Matt blinks at the kid for a moment then stands up

MATT
Hey this is kinda silly Why dont
you two sit together

MARIANNE
Oh Are you sure Thats very sweet

Marianne crosses the aisle to sit with her daughter Matt
takes her old seat next to the Gray-Haired Businessman

GRAY-HAIRED BUSINESSMAN
Dead wife huh Thats one I havent
tried
Matt just stares at him The guys smile wilts

GRAY-HAIRED BUSINESSMAN (CONTD)
Oh Sorry

A PERKY FLIGHT ATTENDANT shuts the cabin door
CAPTAIN (VO)

(over the PA)
Flight crew prepare for departure

CUT TO
EXT JFK AIRPORT -- NIGHT
Flight 209 floats off of the tarmac and leaves the
shimmering New York skyline behind

CUT TO

INT FLIGHT 209 FIRST CLASS CABIN -- NIGHT

The cabin lights are dimmed Passengers read or listen
to iPods or watch videos Many sleep or try to

Marianne and her daughter are slumped against one another
Laney clutching her stuffed elephant

But Matt is wide awake Not reading Not watching the
movie Instead he plays with his wedding ring Taking it
off Putting it back on Over and over

He looks at it on his finger thinking

Then he takes it off and sets it on his tray table

He drains the last bit of scotch from his glass then he
leans back and closes his eyes

--euntil
Something JOLTS the plane Matt looks around notices --
Laney waking with a start
MATT
Its okay They call that clear

air turbulence --

Another JOLT rocks the fuselage and suddenly everyone is
awake This isnt turbulence Its like they hit something

LANEY
Mommy

MARIANNE
Its okay honey

A wave of concern washes over the passengers Then a whole
series of small JOLTS elicits some nervous gasps

The seatbelt sign lights up with a DING The cabin lights
flicker up to their full intensity

And Matt notices that his ring is gone from his tray table

CAPTAIN (VO)
(over the PA)
Folks as youve probably noticed
were experiencing some moderate
chop Nothing to get too excited
about Were skirting the edge of
the jet stream and -- whoa shit --

The PA cuts out And suddenly the plane is LURCHING to
one side the fuselage GROANING with stress

Whatever show of calm people could manage is now abandoned
Passengers scream outright and clutch their armrests

The Businessman grabs Matts arm Matt pries him off

LANEY
Mommy

The airplane RATTLES and JERKS side to side Overhead
compartments BOUNCE open Luggage falls out

COPILOT (VO) CAPTAIN (VO)
(over the PA) (in background of PA)
Ladies and gentleman -am declaring an
were experiencing emergency Repeat I am
some temporary declaring an emergency
equipment malfunction Were experiencing a total
We expect to We loss of aircraft control --

expect --

The intercom cuts out again A TOP-HEAVY FLIGHT ATTENDANT
barrels up the aisle and POUNDS on the cockpit door

When the door opens to let her in Matt gets a brief
glimpse of the chaos inside -- the CAPTAIN wrestling with
the yoke And something beyond the windscreen --

Bright lights in the night sky

Then the door SLAMS shut

Matt leans over the Gray-Haired Businessman to peer into
the black night beyond his window

Something flashes past and the plane is JOLTED again

MATT
-- Did you see that
GRAY-HAIRED BUSINESSMAN
-- See what

Matt unbuckles himself and stands He teeters against the
sway of the airplane and looks out the other side to see --

Another flash of something -- almost like a huge metallic
snake And hes not the only one who saw it

FOOTBALL PLAYER
What the fuck was that

The Perky Flight Attendant steadies herself in the
passageway to coach She spots Matt standing up

PERKY FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Sir I need you to take your seat

But another JOLT throws them both sideways
Matt grabs onto the forward bulkhead just as the plane
goes into a dive The sudden G-force is staggering The

Perky Flight Attendant goes rolling back into coach

Matts feet come right off the deck and he swings from
the bulkhead like a flag in high winds

Marianne grimaces and holds onto a terrified Laney
GRAY-HAIRED BUSINESSMAN
Oh Christ Were going down Were

going down

MATT
Shut up would you

The mans panic only makes Laney cry harder

Oxygen masks drop down but that only incites more panic
The Football Player clutches his cross pendant and prays
The Frosty Model Type has lost her cool

The Young Guns cling to one another machismo be damned
And theres Matt All alone at the bulkhead No God to
soothe him No mother No friend Just the ever-rising

pitch of the JET ENGINES as the plane plummets earthward

MATT (CONTD)
Oh shit

Then he spots something rolling around in the aisle --
His wedding band

Matt crawls toward it grabs the ring slips it back on

Matt fights against the clawing G-force back to his seat

The constant SCREAMING of all the passengers is barely
audible over the agonized WHINE of the jet engines

Matt fumbles for the seatbelt He finds it dangling behind
him Tries to bring it forward to latch it but

The plane HITS something and Matt is thrown out of his
seat Not forward but up

He is weightless spinning in midair along with every
loose article of clothing and luggage

And then he SLAMS back down to the deck

And everything gets perfectly still and quiet

The plane is pitched nose-down but is somehow intact
The passengers are alive The engines SPIN DOWN Its all
such a surprise for a moment people forget how to scream

And then they remember

The airplane comes alive again with SCREAMING SOBBING
VOMITING and the occasional RELIEVED LAUGH

Matt pulls himself to his feet He kneels on his seat and
looks out the window with the Gray-Haired Businessman

MATT (CONTD)
What happened

GRAY-HAIRED BUSINESSMAN
I--I dont know

Its dark out there but something is visible -- a high
sloping ribbed black wall

MATT
The son of a bitch landed it --
How the helld he do that

By now half the passengers are on their feet peering
out the windows muttering similar questions

PERKY FLIGHT ATTENDANT (VO)
(over the PA)
Ladies and gentlemen please if
everyone would take their seats

The cockpit door BANGS open and the Top-Heavy Flight
Attendant staggers out her nose bleeding hands trembling
The passengers pummel her with questions

TOP-HEAVY FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Please sit down Does anyone
require medical attention

GRAY-HAIRED BUSINESSMAN
Where are we How did we land

The flight attendant is a deer in the headlights

FOOTBALL PLAYER
Maam where did we go down

TOP-HEAVY FLIGHT ATTENDANT
We -- we didnt

YOUNG GUN 1
What the fuck are you talking about

MARIANNE
What happened to us

The crowd assails her with questions again and the Top-
Heavy Flight Attendant withers under the barrage

TOP-HEAVY FLIGHT ATTENDANT
We didnt go down we -- I think
we went up

The passengers fall into mystified silence

The Top-Heavy Flight Attendants eyes well up and she
rushes into the lavatory SLAMMING the door behind her

The passengers MURMUR in confusion once again
Football Player is checking his phone
FOOTBALL PLAYER
Im not getting a signal Is anybody

getting a signal

Matt digs out his phone and turns it on He leans over
the Gray-Haired Businessman and looks out the window again

Theyre definitely in a large structure with ribbed
concave walls Like they were swallowed by a metal whale

Matt presses against the small window to peer backward

The wing is intact but something is wrapped around it --
like a colossal steel snake

Matt leaps up out of his seat and blinks at the window
He climbs the sloped aisle and opens the curtain into --
THE COACH CABIN

Its madness 150 panicked travelers pleading for answers
Half of them wear the dangling yellow oxygen masks

MATT
Can anyone see -- what is that on
the wing

His question is lost in the furor Those seated on the
wing look at something outside -- and theyre not happy

But the aisle is too jammed for Matt to go see for himself
The Perky Flight Attendant nudges him back up front

PERKY FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Sir please sit back down

Matt returns to --
FIRST CLASS

but hes too wound up to sit down He remembers the phone
in his hand and checks it He yells to the Football Player

MATT
No signal here either

MARIANNE
What is that stuff on the wings

Matt looks down at her as she holds her terrified child

MATT
--l dont know

LANEY
Mommy Are we Did we crash Are
we

MARIANNE

No No honey Were okay
Young Gun 2 clambers out of his seat

YOUNG GUN 2
What the fuck is going on here
SOMEBODY TELL US WHAT THE FUCK IS
GOING ON

CAPTAIN (VO)
(over the PA)
All right folks weve all hada
scare but I need you to settle
down and give me your attention

The Captains warm southern drawl calms the mob a little

CAPTAIN (VO CONTD)
I wish I could tell you whats
happened to us but the truth is
I just dont know

(MORE )

CAPTAIN (VO CONTD)
But I do know that the aircraft is
intact and we are all alive And
thats what counts So lets keep
our cool while we figure this out

Its quiet for almost three seconds before PANIC returns

CUT TO SILENCE

INT FLIGHT 209 FIRST CLASS CABIN -- MOMENTS LATER
The first class passengers are riveted by something

The CAPTAIN (50s) at the cabin door Gripping the handle
Peering into the darkness through the small porthole

The Perky and Top-Heavy Flight Attendants gather behind
him with a MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT and a BLONDE one

The Captain turns the handle and opens the door with a
slight HISS as the cabin pressure equalizes

From Matts seat he is in a good position to see outside

The Captain crouches down to deploy the evacuation chute
Compressed air EXPLODES into the inflatable yellow slide

CAPTAIN
Janet a flashlight please

JANET the Top-Heavy Flight Attendant hands him a light

MATT
Are you going out there Isnt
there someone else who can --

TOP-HEAVY FLIGHT ATTENDANTJANET
Weve got the situation under
control sir

MATT
Are we on the ground
(to the Captain)
Are you sure we dont need a pilot

CAPTAIN
(thinks it over nods)
If anything happens to me youve
still got the first officer And
Ill take Chris here with me Hows
that

Matt nods placated But Chris the Male Flight Attendant
doesnt look so thrilled with this plan

The Captain sits on the deck and launches himself down
the chute and out of view

The Blonde Flight Attendant gives Chris a flashlight and
a worried smile Chris follows the Captain out the door

The passengers look out the port-side windows to watch

The Captain and Chris are visible down below walking
across the wet black floor

Matt isnt satisfied with this constrained view He joins
the attendants in the open doorway and peers out into --

THE AIRPLANE BAY

and for the first time Matt gets an unfettered glimpse
at the structure that now houses this entire airplane

It is a great black cavern lit only by the planes
landing lights and the glow of the cabin windows Its so
big and dark you cant make out the far reaches of it

But the effect is like being inside a black widow Shiny
wet malevolent

MATT
Jesus

JANET
Sir you need to take your seat

Matt starts for his seat but Janet furtively latches
onto him and holds him there as she stares into this abyss

The Captain and Chris walk back along the fuselage their
footsteps echoing in the darkness They shine their lights
on the aircraft illuminating --

A tangle of metallic vine-like tentacles hanging down
from the darkness to envelop the wings and the fuselage
These greasy tentacles suspend the plane in midair its
nose dangling just a few feet off the floor

PERKY FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Oh God what is this place

The Perky Flight Attendant retreats back inside

MATT
(re the tentacles)
These things -- they caught us
They -- what They reeled us in

Janet looks at him
MATT (CONTD)
You were in the cockpit What did
you see

She starts to cry without even seeming to realize it

MATT (CONTD)
Someone -- something -- plucked us
out of the sky

She doesnt answer She just looks back outside

JANET
Is that a a door

The men shine their lights at the ribbed wall One of the
ribs stretches out further than the others its end a
hollowed-out tube The two men edge toward that opening
MATT
(to himself)
Dont go in there

The Captain cups his hand to his mouth and hollers

CAPTAIN
Hello Anyone there

The only response is his own FAINT ECHO He steps closer
peers into the darkness and finally enters the tunnel

JANET
(to herself)
No dont go in there
But he does And Chris follows The deeper they go the
dimmer the glow of their flashlights becomes until the
entire opening disappears back into darkness

MATT
Captain

Matt and Janet cant hear over the furor inside the plane
JANET
Ladies and gentleman please keep
it down Were trying to --

A far-off MUFFLED SCREAM draws her attention back outside

JANET (CONTD)
Captain Captain

MATT
(to the passengers)
Hey Shut up

The passengers quiet down

JANET
Captain

No response but the cold silence of this cavernous vault

CUT TO NOISE

INT FLIGHT 209 FIRST CLASS CABIN -- MOMENTS LATER
The plane is filled with the DIN OF FRIGHTENED PASSENGERS

Matt stands with the attendants and the young COPILOT
(30s) at the cockpit door nearly shouting to be heard

COPILOT
Sir my main concern here is to
establish contact with traffic
control and to determine our --

MATT
Establish contact You mean were
currently out of contact
(before he can answer)
Look somebodys got to go after
those guys And it shouldnt be
you and it shouldnt them

He indicates the quaking flight attendants

COPILOT
Sir airline regulations are quite
clear about this --

MATT
You have regulations to address
this scenario

COPILOT
Sir --

MATT
Just let me put together a few
volunteers Well go out there and
well get to the bottom of this

FOOTBALL PLAYER
Ill go with you bro

The towering athlete stands and comes to Matts side

COPILOT
Gentleman I cant allow you to --

MATT
Im not asking permission anymore
You go establish contact or
whatever you need to do
(to Janet)
Can I have that intercom

COPILOT
Janet do not --

Shes already passing the handset to Matt He keys it
MATT
Everybody can I get your attention
We need a few able-bodied men to
come up front please The crew is
a little overextended and we need
some volunteers for a brief
excursion Thank you

Marianne watches impressed as Matt returns the handset
to Janet He points to the Young Guns a few rows back

MATT (CONTD)
How about you two Want to stretch
your legs

They exchange nervous glances but keep quiet

A brute with a MILITARY HAIRCUT emerges from coach with
four other men trailing behind him They wobble down the
steep aisle to the front of the plane

MILITARY HAIRCUT
What can we do for you

MATT
You guys want to come outside
help me try and find the captain

Military Haircut looks out the open door tries to conceal

his mounting terror

MILITARY HAIRCUT
Sure What the hell

MATT
Great
(to Janet)
Well need some flashlights

PERKY FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Excuse me please pardon us

They all look back to see Perky escorting a STOUT MAN in
a dark blazer out of coach and down to the copilot

PERKY FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONTD)
Sir remember I told you we had a
federal agent on board

COPILOT
This is him

STOUT MAN
(flashes a badge)
Special agent Hay ATF Traveling
to San Francisco on a case

Agent Hay peels back his blazer to show the Copilot
something concealed within The Copilot nods

MATT
Great Were glad to have you

Janet distributes flashlights to the search party

JANET
Ill come along The company would
insist on it

MATT
Screw the company Janet You dont
have to come

Matt takes the last light from her and gives it to Hay

AGENT HAY
You part of the crew

MATT
No but its my search party

AGENT HAY
Is it Am I supposed to take orders
from you

MATT
Hey Im not trying to get ina
pissing match here --

AGENT HAY
I hope not

(holds up his badge)
Unless you have one of these No
Okay then Its my search party
Youre welcome to join it

MATT
(looks at him thinks)
You know Maybe Ill just leave

this in your capable hands

AGENT HAY
Suit yourself

He takes Matts flashlight and hands it to Janet

AGENT HAY (CONTD)
Lets go sweetheart

Matt watches as Agent Hay Military Haircut the Football
Player and three other men file down the evacuation chute

Janet follows but pauses at the threshold

MATT
Dont go
(to the Copilot)
Stop her man

Janet looks back at them

COPILOT
The company would insist

MATT
Oh come on

Janet straightens her uniform with professional pride

JANET
Ill be okay

She sits on the deck and slides down the chute
Matt goes to the door and looks out into --
THE AIRPLANE BAY

to watch the search party edging toward the wall their
light beams dancing around this strange place

They arrive at the tube and Agent Hay leads them inside
They all disappear into the darkness within

Matt leans out of the doorway to escape from the CLAMOR
of the passengers inside And he listens

He can just make out the DISTANT CONVERSATION of the search
party inside that corridor Then a sudden flurry of PANIC
in their voices Followed by SCREAMS And a sharp SLAM
And thensilence
Matt stares into that darkness and shrinks back into --
THE CABIN
Perky Flight Attendant is beside him
PERKY FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Well lets just wait and see I

guess Christ I need a cigarette

CUT TO SILENCE

INT FLIGHT 209 FIRST CLASS CABIN -- LATER

Wait-and-see A tense hush has descended on the passengers
Perky Flight Attendant paces at the open door

Matt is back in his seat staring out the window

Marianne holds Laney tight Laney trembles with excitement

LANEY
Mommy when are they coming back

MARIANNE
I dont know honey Soon

LANEY
Why dont we all just go out there

MARIANNE
Because It may not be safe

LANEY
But mom
(a whisper)
Dont you want to see what they
look like
Marianne looks at Laney Not sure how to answer that

MARIANNE
Laney I have to go to bathroom

LANEY
Okay

MARIANNE
I want you to come with me

LANEY
I dont have to go

MARIANNE
Come with me anyway

Marianne stands up but Laney stays put shaking her head

MARIANNE (CONTD)
Laney please

LANEY
Its too small in there

Marianne looks at her a moment then turns to Matt

MARIANNE
Could you keep an eye on her

Matt nods without thinking about it

MARIANNE (CONTD)
Thank you

She hurries up the sloping aisle to the lavatory
separating first class from coach

Laney slides over to the aisle seat and looks at Matt

LANEY
Is your wife really dead

MATT
(looks at her)
Yeah She really is

LANEY
How did she die

Matt doesnt answer Isnt sure how to

LANEY (CONTD)
Its none of my business
(re the open door)
Whats so scary out there

MATT
I dont know Maybe nothing

LANEY
Then how come you didnt go along
with that cop

MATT
Hes thinking with his lizard brain

LANEY
He has a lizard brain

MANS VOICE (0S)
I told you get your hands off me

A sudden RUCKUS breaks out back in coach Perky Flight
Attendant hurries back there to quell it

MATT

We all have a lizard brain Its
just a little thing left over
from evolution

(re the ruckus)
Sometimes when people get scared
they forget how smart they are
They rely on their lizard brains

to help them survive Its a
good way to get the people around
you killed

Matt looks at the ring on his finger Gives it a twist

LANEY
Is that what happened to your wife

Matt looks at her He wants to be angry but shes just a
kid It was an innocent question

Laney kneels on her seat to look back at coach

LANEY (CONTD)
Its too small in here

MATT
Amen sister

MANS VOICE (0S)
I SAID GET YOUR FUCKING HANDS OFF
ME

Matt looks toward the unseen dustup back in coach Several
attendants are trying to deal with it

MATT
Whats going on back there

Matt looks at the Young Guns in the back of first class
They shrug not quite as curious as Matt

Nobody notices Laney inching toward the open cabin door

Matt turns back to find Laneys seat empty He looks around
the entryway Shes nowhere in sight

Matt jumps up and goes to the cabin door to see --
Laney sitting on the ground at the bottom of the chute
MATT (CONTD)
Hey Little girl What are you
doing
She stands up and looks up at him
MATT (CONTD)
Are you okay Can you climb back
up

She retreats not eager to go back into the plane

MATT (CONTD)
Stay right there Im coming down

Matt prepares to launch himself down the shoot when --

MARIANNE (0S)
What happened Laney

Marianne bounds down the tilted aisle toward him

MATT
Shes okay -- shes right here

Matt points down the chute but --
Laney is gone
Marianne shoves Matt out of the way and leans out to see --

Laney walking under the fuselage exploring

MARIANNE
Laney
(she shoves Matt aside)
Dammit You said youd watch her

Marianne jumps onto the chute Matt yells after her

MATT
You didnt tell me she was a flight
risk
INT AIRPLANE BAY -- CONTINUOUS

Matt follows Marianne down the chute He slips trying to
stand on the wet floor He puts out a hand to break his
fall and ends up with black gunk all over his palm

MARIANNE
Laney Where are you

Marianne runs after Laney Matt follows but slows to
examine the tentacles wrapped around the fuselage

He touches their complex woven texture tentative It
looks like metal but is supple like flesh Matt recoils

The aircraft is scraped up and smeared with grime from
when these things wrested it from the air Watery goo
drizzles down the tentacles from the darkness above

MARIANNE (CONTD)
Where is she Laney

LANEY (0S)
Mommy

Marianne and Matt follow the sound of her voice further
aft They scramble under the fuselage and emerge on --

THE STARBOARD SIDE
to see Laney running toward them But --

A great spiked shape emerges from the darkness behind her --
atremendous claw-like thing

MARIANNE
LANEY

A half-dozen bony fingers envelop the little girl like
silvery spider legs shrouded in diaphanous tissue

LANEY
MOMMY

The great CLAW draws Laney back and up into the air up
into the darkness vanishing along with her

After a moment even her screams are gone

Matt and Marianne arrive at the spot where Laney last
stood They look up but its too dark to see anything

MARIANNE
What in Gods name was that
-Laney

Matt just stands there blinking up at the darkness

But Marianne is on a mission She races to the back wall --
another curving ribbed surface like the others

MARIANNE (CONTD)
LANEY

She POUNDS on the metallic walls tries to shimmy up one
of the smooth ribs but its too slick

As Matt catches up with Marianne she turns toward the
open tube back on the port side of the airplane

MARIANNE (CONTD)
Is that where the others went

MATT
Yeah but --

Shes off and running before he can finish

MATT (CONTD)
Hey wait

Matt sprints and easily overtakes her He grabs her arm
just as shes about to enter the corridor

MARIANNE
Get off me

MATT
You havent even got a light

She elbows him in the ribs and pulls free Without any
hesitation she steps into the pitch dark corridor

MARIANNE
Laney Can you hear me

Matt watches her go Doesnt want to follow but doesnt
want to be out here either He looks back at the airplane

MATT
I need a flashlight

A hundred gawking faces stare out from the tiny windows

Matt digs the phone from his pocket and holds the lit-up
display before him -- a feeble makeshift flashlight He
takes a deep breath and steps into the corridor

INT AIRPLANE BAY CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS

Matt inches down the corridor -- like a giant pipe -- and
catches up with Marianne groping blindly down the wall

MATT
This way To the right

He takes her elbow and guides her around a bend
Matt runs a hand along the filthy obsidian wall

MARIANNE
Laney

The only answer is her own voice echoing back -- and a
DEEP RUMBLE from somewhere inside the walls

As they inch forward the end of the corridor looms into
the dim light of the phone Its a dead-end

MARIANNE (CONTD)
Well what the hell

She starts toward the far wall but Matt grabs her arm

MATT
Wait -- listen

A MUFFLED SCREAM emanates from somewhere And another

MATT (CONTD)
Underneath us

They crouch and cock their ears to the floor Its a man
SCREAMING bloody murder and other frightened VOICES

MARIANNE
How did they get down there

She stands and squints at the walls surrounding them

Matts hand brushes something on the floor He points the
phone light at a seam in the otherwise seamless floor

Marianne approaches the far wall One more step and --
Something CLICKS and Matt discovers too late that the

seam is the hinge side of a huge trap door that swings
out from under them and drops them onto --

INT THE TORTURE CHAMBER -- CONTINUOUS

-- a long sloping surface like a hollowed-out rib that
spills them onto a smooth floor where they are met with
agonized SCREAMS and are blinded by harsh lights shining
down on them from high above

SILHOUETTED FIGURES encircle them and close in

Its Agent Hay and his search party They help Matt and
Marianne to their feet as they take in their surroundings

Theyre standing on a large round platform that seems to
hang in an empty black void suspended by these long
ribs all radiating away from the platform like spokes
and disappearing in the glare of the lights above

Matt steps toward the edge of the platform Its ringed
with long thin curving prongs that cage them in The
SCREAMING comes from beyond the edge where ten feet below --

THE CAPTAIN

reclines nude in some kind of restraint held in place by
several insectoid mechanical limbs at the end of a huge
crane arm hanging down from the ceiling while other sharp
devices poke and prod him

MATT AND MARIANNE
blink at this horror as Military Haircut comes to their
side Everyone is a mess their skin and clothing soiled

from their slide down the grimy rib

MARIANNE
My little girl -- where is she

MILITARY HAIRCUT
No little girl in here

MARIANNE

What is this place Whats going

on
Shes barraged with confused and fragmented responses
Matt looks back down at the Captain
One of the mechanical arms IGNITES a blowtorch and moves
the blue flame closer and closer to the Captains thigh
until he goes rigid with agony Then the torch backs off

MATT
What are they doing to him

Matt studies the tall prongs that cage them in He could
easily fit between them but as he approaches --

Energy CRACKLES visibly between those prongs not quite
electricity and not quite fire but something new

JANET
No Dont touch it

Matt turns to see Janet kneeling over Chris her male
coworker whos cradling a badly charred hand

JANET (CONTD)
Do not touch it

MATT
Understood

Matt backs away from the prongs and the energy dissipates

With a sharp MECHANICAL REPORT ametal arm swings out

from under the platform and suspends an enormous lens
element over the Captain greatly magnifying him just as --

One of the arms stabs his abdomen with a thick needle
almost like an amniocentesis The Captain SCREAMS again
his tortured expression distorted through that giant lens

MATT (CONTD)
Goddamn

MILITARY HAIRCUT
Look out Here it comes again

People SCREAM and scatter as --

A GLOWING HEMISPHERE

hanging high above splits open like an egg disgorging a
massive skeletal object that unfolds in three long

segments the end unfurling right in front of them to
reveal a huge CLAW just like the one that took Laney

Its like some unseen giant is reaching its arm into this
room The whole thing is at least 40 feet long It swings
around studying the passengers with a pulsating amber
orb at the center of its radiating fingers

Its like a skinless hand with metallic bones strewn with
a web of ligaments Its hard to tell if this thing is
organic or mechanical or perhaps something thats evolved
far past any meaningful distinction between the two

MATT

scrambles backwards away from this nightmarish intruder
But Marianne stands her ground on shaking legs

MARIANNE
Where is my daughter

The Claw lunges toward Marianne but --

Matt yanks her away and hides her in the small crowd

The Claw scans the group for her but settles for Janet
instead It grabs her and pulls her away from the group
to inspect her as she screams

Military Haircut rushes forward and punches at the Claw
But it KNOCKS him aside with just the slightest flick

A multi-headed tendril snakes out of the Claw and looms
over Janet with four sharp stingers each one like scorpion
tail She shrieks in frozen terror

With a blur of movement the stingers slice away Janets
blouse exposing her bra She tries to cover herself

The tendril retracts back into the Claw The Claw grabs
Janet and carries her screaming away from the platform

A light shines down on another examination chair beside
the Captains The Claw lays Janet on it while insectoid
legs LASH out from the chair and pin her down

Then the Claw folds itself up and retracts all the way up
into its translucent hemisphere in the ceiling

More arms appear poking and prodding Janet tearing the
clothes from her body And another giant lens rotates out
from under the platform to magnify her distress

MATT

averts his eyes but when he turns away he finds Agent
Hay still watching with morbid curiosity Matt approaches

MATT
You have a gun Why arent you
using it

He pats the bulge in Hays blazer Hay swats his hand

AGENT HAY
Against what
(re the Claw)
That thing

MATT
Youre a public servant Defend
these people

AGENT HAY
Im waiting for the right moment
Now stop drawing attention to us

He edges away from Matt joining the others as they watch
this awful spectacle with dread and anticipation

Matt studies the rib they slid down He takes a run at
it but halfway up it goes nearly vertical He loses
traction and comes sliding back down getting even dirtier

MILITARY HAIRCUT
Already tried that dude No joy

Matt gets to his feet and looks around for other options

A mechanical arm shoves some sort of sensor down the
Captains throat choking off his screams -- and his air

Marianne looks away unable to bear the sight

Suddenly the sensor withdraws from the Captains throat
The lenses retract and the insectoid restraints release

The Captain and Janet roll off their examination chairs
and onto the floor naked bruised and bleeding

The Claw reemerges unfolds snatches them both up and
drops them back onto the platform

Then it backs away watching

Military Haircut peels off his coat and wraps it around
Janet She sobs and shudders like a rape victim

MILITARY HAIRCUT (CONTD)
You okay maam

She looks up to thank him but screams instead because --

The Claw grabs Military Haircut and carries him away

A new beam of light illuminates another area of the vast
floor below The Claw drops Military Haircut into a ring
of tall prongs that CRACKLE with energy imprisoning him

Everyone watches waiting to see what happens next
Matt doffs his dress shirt and hands it to the Captain
The Captain holds it together a little better than Janet

but his trembling hands belie his outward confidence

CAPTAIN
What am I supposed to do with this

MATT
(shrugs )
Loincloth

The Captain ties the shirt around his waist to spare
everyone the worst of his nudity

Marianne goes to Janet gives her a shoulder to cry on

JANET
-What do they want

A MASSIVE METAL SPHERE
descends from the darkness on a vine-like cable like a
wrecking ball It dangles just above Military Haircuts
circular prison and then is lowered slowly inside
Giant lenses rotate out from the platform at the end of
long rods to magnify Military Haircut watching terrified
as the sphere descends toward him He reaches up and pushes
against it a futile effort Meanwhile --

THE CLAW

swings back to the platform and picks out another victim --
a young guy in a BLACK T-SHIRT

BLACK T-SHIRT
No no -- please -- somebody help

The Claw places him on one of the examination chairs the
insectoid legs pinning him in place

A single mechanical arm rises up beside him holding a
wheel of thick needles -- at least two dozen of them

Lenses rotate into place to show the wheel rolling up one
of his legs the needles stabbing through his jeans
injecting him with various colored fluids He CRIES OUT
And in the midst of all this chaos --

THE TRAP DOOR OVERHEAD

CREAKS open and dumps FIVE MORE PASSENGERS down the rib --
another search party The new men hit the platform and
look around stunned and amazed

Marianne is knocked into Matts arms by the influx

MATT
You okay

MARIANNE
Am I okay Youre kidding right

MATT
Stay near the middle and dont do
anything to stand out -- like you

know yelling at that thing

MARIANNE
That thing has my little girl

MATT
Lady it has all of us

MILITARY HAIRCUT
cries out from his cylindrical prison The sphere pushing
down on him has brought him to his knees He fights against
it with all his might but it descends inexorably
MARIANNE

shakes her head at the sight

MARIANNE
Theyre going to kill him
THE CLAW
grabs a new arrival -- an ASIAN TOURIST He hasnt even

digested whats going on before hes caught up in it
Another shaft of light reveals a large sphere embedded in
the floor just the very top of it exposed Its surrounded
by more of those energized prongs

The Claw deposits the Asian Tourist on top of the sphere
He looks around terrified He tries to step off but energy
CRACKLES between the surrounding prongs singeing the

mans arm Asian Tourist wisely steps back onto the sphere
But it starts slowly rolling beneath him pushing him

back toward the prongs He must walk in place on the sphere
or be thrown into that deadly energy field

Then the speed increases and he must jog to keep up

MATT

shakes his head in pity

MATT
Aw come on

The Claw wheels around again descends on the scattering
prisoners and grabs the Football Player

FOOTBALL PLAYER
Oh God no -- please God --

The Claw holds him just out of reach beyond the edge of
the platform pinning his arms to his sides

It pinches his head and tilts it left and right taxing
the flexibility of his neck The kid screams

Marianne covers her eyes but others stand transfixed as --

The Claw SNAPS the kids spine and his legs stop moving

JANET
Oh

Janet doubles over and begins to retch
THE CLAW
sets the Football Players limp body on the vacant
examination chair A lens rotates over his face Hes not
yet dead -- gasping for air a fish on dry land
Mechanical arms rise up out of the table and brandish
long bright blades They carve into his abdomen --
vivisecting him Arterial blood jets up toward --
THE PLATFORM

boiling and CRACKLING as it flies through the energy field
and SPLASHES onto the floor

Marianne looks away jamming her fists into her eyes
And then a disturbing CRUNCHING sound draws all eyes to --
MILITARY HAIRCUT

who has succumbed to the crushing weight of the wrecking
ball now PULPING his flesh and bones into pudding

The sphere draws back up and the CRACKLING prongs retract
allowing the Claw to sweep Military Haircuts bloody
remains onto a circle etched in the floor

Its a trap door It swings in with a deafening RUSH OF
AIR that sucks the corpse down

After a moment the door SLAMS shut silencing the terrible
wind and leaving only a smear of blood behind Then --

THE CLAW
swings back over the platform and grabs Janet again

JANET (CONTD)
Oh no you dont

It also snatches up a scrawny TEENAGE KID and carries
them both up past the glare of the lights

It returns empty-handed and grabs a CHUBBY SALESMAN by
the leg As it carries him away he clings onto --

Matt who struggles to break free But the guy is too

strong and the Claw carries them both up into the darkness
beyond the lights and drops them through an opening into --
INT PUZZLE ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

-- a small dim room And then the opening SLAMS shut

Matt blinks in the dim illumination of recessed lights

Half-naked Janet and the Teenage Kid cower in the corner
Chubby Salesman rolls around his back in pain

TEENAGE KID
Whats gonna happen to us now

Matt stands up nearly hits his head on the low ceiling
He starts toward the back wall to find a row of prongs
They CRACKLE with energy stopping Matt dead in his tracks

MATT
Okay

Then the prongs start sliding forward Matt backs up but
they keep inching toward him

MATT (CONTD)
Oh shit

Some kind of display lights up on the front wall

JANET
Whats that

Its a pyramid pattern of circles -- five rows of them
one circle on top five on the bottom

Each circle is composed of 12 lights -- but only a few in
each circle are lit And the bottom row is totally dark

CHUBBY SALESMAN
(re the row of prongs)
Is that going to keep coming ‘Cause
if it is

The Teenage Kid looks at the shrinking floor space between
the front wall and the moving prongs

JANET
So what are we supposed to do

MATT
My guess is were supposed to die --
unless we can figure out this thing

He approaches the pyramid display

JANET
Is it some kind of control panel

MATT
Or maybe a puzzle

Chubby Salesman retreats from the prongs

CHUBBY SALESMAN
Well shit Someone figure it out

Janet touches one of the lit-up circles Nothing happens
She pokes a dark circle in the bottom row and one of the
twelve squares lights up

MATT
Maybe we have to complete the series --
figure out what comes next

CHUBBY SALESMAN
So just press every one till
something happens

He reaches for the display but Matt waves him off

MATT
Dont waste our time -- theres a
few hundred thousand permutations

Janet checks the prongs Their space is cut in half

TEENAGE KID
I know what that is

They all look at the kid Hes pointing to the display

TEENAGE KID (CONTD)
We just did this in math class
Oh whats it called Somebodys
triangle

Matt looks back at the display and it comes to him

MATT
Pascals Triangle

TEENAGE KID
Yeah Thats it

CHUBBY SALESMAN
Whats it do

MATT
Im trying to remember how it works

TEENAGE KID
(wracking his brain)
Okay lets see Pascal didnt
invent it Its been around since
like ancient China The Persians
had it I think --

CHUBBY SALESMAN
(smacks his head)
How does it work

JANET
Hey leave him alone

Matt concentrates on the display thinking out loud

MATT
Its a simple pattern -- shit
hows it go

TEENAGE KID
Doesnt it have something to do
with theFibonacci sequence

Matt counts out the lights in each circle row by row

MATT
One
One one
One two one
One three three one

CHUBBY SALESMAN
So the next row is one four four
four one

He shoves Matt aside and starts tapping the display to
light up the appropriate number of squares in each circle

CHUBBY SALESMAN (CONTD)
One four four four one

But the prongs keeps coming -- close enough now that
theyre CRACKLING constantly

CHUBBY SALESMAN (CONTD)
Fuck

The Teenage Kid breaks into uncontrollable sobbing Janet
puts a consoling arm around him

Chubby Salesman PUNCHES the display until Matt elbows him
aside so he can study the pattern again

Chubby Salesman hugs the wall to avoid the prongs
Matt stares at the pattern until it comes to him
MATT
Each number is the sum of the two
above it So -- one four six
four one

The CRACKLING prongs ignite Chubby Salesmans coattails

CHUBBY SALESMAN
Oh Christ

Matt taps two more lights in the middle circle to change
the count from four to six

Theres a loud CLANG and the floor drops out from under
them They plummet onto --

INT THE TORTURE CHAMBER -- CONTINUOUS

-- one the ribs and skitter back down to the platform
where Chubby Salesman tears off his smoldering jacket

Marianne rushes to Matts side and helps him to his feet

MARIANNE
Are you okay What happened

MATT
They made us do math

She thinks hes joking but his look is pure shell shock

MATT (CONTD)
It was scarier than it sounds

The Claw swings over the platform and drops something
right in front of them with a WET THUD

The bloody shredded remains of the Football Player

People SCREAM and scramble away from it but Matt holds
Marianne in place waiting until the Claw retreats again

Matt looks around and notices --

THE ASIAN TOURIST

still running on his rolling sphere now soaked in sweat
BLACK T-SHIRT

is still writhing on his table his leg ballooning up
THE CAPTAIN

paces the platform furious in his dress-shirt loincloth

Matt looks at the carcass of the Football Player He pulls
off the kids sneakers and unbuttons his jeans

SOMEONE IN THE CROWD (0S)
What are you doing man

Matt slides the jeans off of the corpse and hands the
shoes and pants to the Captain wordlessly

The Captain stares at the jeans as if questioning the
ethics of this But then he pulls them on and zips up

Matt takes his shirt back from the Captain and uses it to
cover up the bloody face of the dead Football Player

He looks back at Marianne to find her staring at him
tears streaming down cheeks
MARIANNE
Why didnt they flush him away
like the other guy Why did they
throw him back up here

She looks at the Claw now hovering above the platform
staring down at them with its one cold eye

MARIANNE (CONTD)
What do you want with us Why are
you torturing us like this WHERE
IS MY LITTLE GIRL

MATT
Theyre not torturing us Theyre
testing us

Marianne looks back at Matt Everyone does

MATT (CONTD)
I think theyre studying us Looking
for our limitations Our weaknesses

TEENAGE KID
But why

AGENT HAY
Know the enemy kid Thats basic
Sun Tzu
(off the kids look)
The Art of War

Matt glares at Agent Hay and marches right up to him

MATT
If its a war they want then why
dont we give it to them

AGENT HAY
(sotto)
Dont do this

MATT
If youre too chickenshit to use
the gun then give it to me

A guy in a NICE SUIT listens in

NICE SUIT
What gun What are you guys talking
about

MATT

(re Agent Hay)
Hes got a gun

Concern ripples through the crowd

NICE SUIT
Howd he get a gun on an airplane

MATT
I dont know but hes got one

CAPTAIN
Federal agents are permitted to
carry onboard if their work
requires it
(to Agent Hay)
But why keep it a secret

AGENT HAY
Im waiting for the right moment

NICE SUIT
How many people have to die while
youre waiting When is the right
moment

MATT
(re the Claw)
When that thing comes after him
Hes just hoarding it for his own
protection

The crowd silently turns on Agent Hay He looks around at
the accusing faces

AGENT HAY
Youd have done the same thing
(looks right at Matt)
Any of you

SOMEONE IN THE CROWD
Look out

The Claw swings in and grabs Nice Suit It carries him
away screaming and deposits him on one of those chairs

Matt reels around toward Agent Hay

MATT
For Gods sake do something

Chubby Salesman grabs Agent Hay from behind by the arms

CHUBBY SALESMAN
Hand it over

Hay easily slips out of the hold but he slips out of his
blazer as well His shoulder holster falls to the floor

Chubby Salesman picks it up and throws it to Matt

Matt draws the Glock and looks at it

MATT
How do you turn off the safety

AGENT HAY

No manual safety its a Glock

Jesus you dont even know --
Matt points the weapon and FIRES a shot that PINGS off --
The Claw It turns away from Nice Suit and zeroes in on --
Matt who FIRES two more shots -- both direct hits But --
The Claw lunges toward him unfazed
Matt turns to run but barely takes one step before --
The Claw tackles him like a 1000-pound linebacker Matt
goes down face-first and as the Claw wraps around him
and drags him away Matt lobs the gun into the crowd

It lands near Marianne who throws her body on top of it

Matt still has the holster He whips it around behind
him futilely STRIKING the Claw with the heavy clip case

The Claw drops him onto the floor hard

Matt recovers and opens his eyes to find himself lying
atop the bloodstained circular trap door

MATT
Shit

He tries to scramble away but --

The trap door opens with a RUSH OF AIR sucking Matt down
He clings to the edge for a frozen moment but the SUCTION
is too great It rips him free and the door SLAMS shut

-on the clip case of Agent Hays shoulder holster

INT EJECTION TUBE -- CONTINUOUS

Matt dangles in space clutching the shoulder holster
with both hands a powerful VACUUM FORCE tearing at him
After a few seconds --

The rush of air stops and all is silent Matt looks down
Hes hanging over a round vertical shaft dimly
illuminated with recessed lights The blood-smeared shaft
curves away and out of view twenty feet below him

Matt looks up for something to grab onto and notices --

The holster is tearing the worn leather giving way

He tries to grab hold of it above the tear when --

The leather SNAPS and Matt plummets He hits the gentle
curve of the chute which redirects him horizontally until --

He SLAMS feet first into a sealed hatch at the end Ouch
He delicately unfolds himself and checks for injuries

The hatch is smooth with no controls Just a dark porthole
in the center Matt looks through it to see --

The moon A silvery crescent in the night sky

But then something else catches his eye and he leans
further over to see what that bright object is

Its the surface of Earth Several thousand miles away --
the Earth as seen from orbit

Matt backs up against the side of the shaft breathless

MATT
-Oh boy

Slowly he turns back to the glass as if to make sure
hes not hallucinating He isnt

Matt gets a hold of himself He looks at the smooth sides
of the shaft If the hatch opens theres nothing to grab

He spots a flush panel in the top side of the shaft He
TAPS on it Sounds hollow Matt digs at the edges with
his nails but it holds fast

He lies on his back and KICKS it Not even a scratch

Matt roots through his pockets and finds a dime He tries
to wedge it into the seam of the panel

The panel moves a quarter inch but Matt drops the dime
and it snaps shut again

As he looks for the dime theres a dull THUD from above --
the exact sound a body would make if it were dropped onto
the trap door

Matt scrambles to locate the dime He finds it jams it
back into the seam and --

The hatch SLAMS open with a deafening RUSH OF AIR just as --
The panel SLIDES open and Matts fingers catch the inside
edge of a newly revealed air intake He clings to it ina

desperate bid to avoid being sucked out into space

Something comes flying down the chute bouncing off of
Matts legs and hurtling into the black void

Matts feet dangle in that deadly vacuum as a TORRENT OF
AIR pours over him from the intake vent

Then the hatch CLOSES pushing Matt back into the shaft

And the panel SLIDES shut on his fingers Painful but he
doesnt withdraw them because he wants in there

He looks out the porthole to see --

The bloody body of Nice Suit drifting away into space
Matt uses his trapped fingers to pry open the panel He
peers into the darkness of the air inlet just big enough

for someone his size to crawl through

So he wriggles into it

INT DUCT -- MOMENTS LATER

Matt inches his way up the narrow round duct again using
his cell phone display to light the way

But the path ahead up the duct is shrouded in darkness
It could go on forever

But then a glow of light passes by an opening high above

Matt and he can see that theres a way out of this duct
if he keeps climbing So he does

CUT TO

INT THE SEWER PIPE -- MOMENTS LATER

Matt reaches the top of the duct and cautiously pokes his
head up into --

A bigger conduit the size of a large sewer pipe Its
dimly lit by some glowing light source

Matt pulls himself up out of the duct and finds theres
enough room to stand up in here He looks to the left to
find the pipe curving away into darkness

He looks to the right to see the source of the light

A glowing hemisphere sitting on the floor

No wait Its not a hemisphere on the floor -- its a
full sphere perched in the floor through a huge iris

Matt crouches down and peeks between the edge of the iris
and the glowing hemisphere down into --

THE TORTURE CHAMBER

directly below Marianne Agent Hay the Captain and the
others are gathered on the platform watching as --

A man stands in a newly lit-up space down on the floor
Its Chris the male flight attendant with the burnt hand
Hes facing off against some kind of small vehicle that

comes rolling toward him with an array of WHIRLING blades

Its like some kind of sick gladiator spectacle -- the
human versus this vicious-looking machine But as --

MATT
tries to absorb all that he realizes --
THE CLAW

down below hovering over the people on the platform is
dangling down from this glowing sphere right beside him

MATT

recoils from it instinctively even though the thing
appears totally unaware of his presence

He stands up and studies the glowing sphere

It hangs from the top of the pipe by a complex mechanism
The sphere is self-contained The Claw can fold up inside
of it but there is apparently nothing more to it than
theyve seen already from below

The Claw is entirely robotic not at all biological

Matt kneels back down pokes his head through the iris
and looks around at --

THE CEILING OF THE TORTURE CHAMBER

to find a curving row of dark glass just twenty feet away
from him -- windows looking down at the humans below

MATT

pulls back into the pipe to consider the implications of
that but before he even gets started --

A faint SCREAM rings out Not from the torture chamber
below but from further up the sewer pipe Matt listens

There it is again A little girls SCREAM -- cut short

Matt runs in the direction of the scream tripping on the
ridges and vine-like tubes that line the pipe walls

He pauses to listen again He hears FAINT VOICES from
back in the torture chamber and deep mechanical GRUMBLING
from the ship itself But no sound of a child anywhere
Then he hears a faint POUNDING very close by

Matt looks down to find hes standing on another iris --
this one closed

He crouches and listens The POUNDING comes from below --
along with MUFFLED SCREAMING

Matt pries at the blades of the iris They open up about
an inch Matt looks through the tiny aperture to see --

A GLASS TUBE

the size of a coffin right underneath him And inside is
a little girl panicking POUNDING on the glass

Its Laney
MATT

stiffens at the sight He pulls at the iris blades but
theyre stuck He puts his mouth to the tiny hole

MATT
Little girl Can you hear me
(to himself)
Dammit What the hells her name
Janey Laney
A new sound fluid GUSHING
Matt looks back through the aperture to see --
WATER
SURGING over Laney rapidly filling the glass tube
MATT

gasps at that sight He pulls on an iris blade but it
just wont budge He puts his mouth back to the hole

MATT (CONTD)
Laney

LANEY
looks for the source of that voice but doesnt notice --

Matts eye peering down through the narrow aperture high
above her And the water level keeps rising

MATT

claws at the iris until his fingers bleed He tries to
force the blades with his heel using all of his weight

He peeks through the aperture again but --

LANEY

fights to breathe the water level rising above her face
MATT

searches the outer ring of the iris where some of the
vine-like tubes feed into the mechanism Its technology

like hes never seen before -- totally unrecognizable

Matt pulls at the vines They feed into some kind of
plumbing system -- maybe a type of hydraulics

He tries to break one of the connections loose Some fluid
SPURTS out and SPARKS against the pipe wall

Matt recoils and waits to see what happens but notices --

The sounds of Laneys struggle have stopped

MATT (CONTD)
Laney

Matt scrambles back to the aperture to a sight that makes
every other horror hes seen today pale in comparison He
closes his eyes gnashes his teeth claws at his scalp
like hes trying to scrape his brain clean of the vision
LANEYS HAND

no longer pounds against the glass It floats down to her
side in slow-motion limp and lifeless

MATT

rolls away from the aperture his hands over his face
His trembling breath revealing his swelling fury Then --

The blades fully RETRACT and Matt nearly falls through
the iris He braces himself and peers down to see --

MORE OBSERVATION WINDOWS

looking right into this private torture chamber of Laneys
MATT

leans over to get a better view determined to find out

who is watching them suffer But a light up ahead catches
his eye Its --
44

A glowing sphere racing down the pipe suspended from an
overhead track -- coming right at him

Matt rolls out of the way just as --

The huge sphere plunges into the iris -- one of those
mechanical Claws retrieving Laneys body

Matt scrambles away from the sphere and trips his way
back down the sewer pipe still shaken by what hes seen

He finds the duct that brought him up here and he fumbles
his way into it slipping and falling straight down --

THE DUCT

until he jams his feet against the sides of the tube and
GRINDS to a stop splitting the flimsy duct at its seam

Matt peeks through the opening to a lighted space beyond

He KICKS the opening wider and spills out onto --

INT THE INNARDS OF THE SHIP -- CONTINUOUS

-- a kind of catwalk deep in the guts of the ship And
guts is the right word

Matt looks around at the vine-like tangled inner workings
that surround him This ship is practically an organism

But down the catwalk is something clearly mechanical

A sealed hatch with a window in it Matt approaches it
He peers through the glass to find --

Another identical door just beyond this one An airlock

Matt searches around the door for controls but cant
find any He checks the right side then the left side

He backs up a step to see what hes missing and he notices --

A couple of flat translucent squares above the door
about a foot apart

Standing on his toes he can just reach one of the squares
It lights up for just a moment but nothing happens

He tries again with the other square Same result It
lights up then goes out with no apparent effect

He tries to slide the door open but it holds fast

He lights up the first square then tries to slide the
door while the light is still lit But the door is locked

Matt steps on a ridge in the wall and pulls himself up so
he can inspect the buttons up close

The finish between the buttons is polished from wear as
if someone frequently touched the panel there

Matt puts his hand between the buttons but nothing
happens He spreads out his fingers and slides his hand
back and forth If his hand was just a couple inches wider
he could press both buttons at the same time

So he uses both hands to press the buttons simultaneously
They light up -- and stay lit

And the door HISSES open Matt hops down and steps into --
THE AIRLOCK

the door HISSING shut behind him startling him He steps
to the door in front of him and peers through the glass

It opens onto some kind of vast dim space

There are two buttons above this door same as the other
Matt thinks for a moment He takes a deep breath and
Jumps tapping a button with each hand

There is a FAINT RUSH OF AIR as the lock pressurizes
then the door HISSES open

Matt lets out his breath and inhales again -- and finds
himself gasping He has a moment of panic but he doesnt
close the door just yet He gives it a few seconds

He finds he can breathe this air -- though just barely

EXT LOWER DECK CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS

Matt leans out of the airlock and into this large hallway
The walls are slick black and the light comes in sharp
pools leaving most the corridor in deep shadow Small
slit windows in the far wall let in starlight from outside

Matt squints up and down the hall Seems empty

He steps outside and falters He leans against the wall
struggling for oxygen The door CLOSES behind him

The walls are dirty and worn A few light fixtures are
burned out And if it wasnt obvious before it sure is

now This place was not built by humans Or for them

Matt creeps across the corridor toward windows but --

He trips on a seam in the floor and falls down These
ridges are all over the floor making walking hazardous

Matt pulls himself up and peers out the window
He sees Earth below And more stars than he knew existed

The corridor has a gradual curve to it revealing that
the ship -- or at least this side of it -- is round

Matt peers along the outer wall and sees --
A strange spherical vehicle docked to the ship

He starts towards it careful to step over the ridges as
he heads down the endlessly curving corridor

CUT TO

INT LIFEBOAT -- MOMENTS LATER

Matts face appears in another airlock He taps the
controls and the door HISSES open Matt steps into --

The vehicle attached to the ship -- perhaps a lifeboat
of sorts although the layout is perplexing Its hard to
even tell if its oriented upright

Matt -- starved for oxygen -- staggers up the narrow cabin
toward the windows at the front Strange mesh harnesses
hang there tethered between the ceiling and the floor
Matt spreads them apart so he can look at the panel at

the front A control panel most likely but the
instruments and controls are mystifying

Matt runs a hand along the myriad shapes and symbols and --

A section of the console tilts up to meet his hand -- a
half-moon array of instrumentation

He recoils Then touches it It dips forward He grabs

hold from underneath -- palms up -- and finds that as
awkward as that is hes able to move it like the control
yoke of an airplane -- left to right back and forth

Matt looks out the window at Earth far below but
something else catches his eye

Dozens of other ships in the black sky tall and thin
like floating skyscrapers They stretch out as far as the
eye can see -- surrounding the entire Earth

This isnt some expedition Its a full-scale invasion

A SHRILL PREHISTORIC CRY vibrates through this ship and
a huge shadow passes overhead

Matt clutches the harness and looks outside to see --
Cyrillic letters gliding past -- markings on the tail
section of a Russian jet now bouncing off the hull and
drifting through space
But the rest of the plane is missing
As the severed tail section slowly spins away Matt can
see inside the fuselage -- the shredded seats dangling

oxygen masks the carry-on luggage floating weightless

Matt turns to see where this wreckage came from He
staggers toward a rear window and looks outside at --

Awhole sea of wreckage -- airplane wings jet engines
cargo containers scraps of aluminum bundles of wiring

This flotsam drifts alongside the fleet trapped in the
same orbital path over Earth

Matt squints at the nearest ship as --

A large hatch opens up and another airplane -- a large
Gulfstream -- is expelled by the same kind of tentacles
that captured Matts passenger jet

The tentacles silently shred the Gulfstream into pieces
too small to damage the other ships as it flings it out

into space like so much garbage

Matts vision starts to fade

INT LOWER DECK CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS

Matt staggers back into the corridor gasping for oxygen
The airlock SEALS behind him He starts back the way he
came but pauses at --

Some strange sound ahead in the distance Like loud
slow FOOTSTEPS And theyre getting closer

Matt turns and flees the other way down the corridor

CUT TO

INT LOWER DECK CORRIDOR ELEVATOR SHAFT -- MOMENTS LATER
Matt comes around the shallow curve of the corridor
keeping an eye out behind him But he turns back around
when he notices a bright light up ahead

Matt slows down cautious As he rounds the bend --

An large open shaft comes into view with two beams of
light shining down through it

Matt steps to the lip of the shaft and peers down to see --
Several levels below all dark
He looks up to see --

The shaft stretches another 40 or 50 stories above him
This ship is tall like the others

Matts vision starts going again oxygen deprived And
those FOOTSTEPS are gaining on him

Matt spins to look behind him and nearly blacks out He
pinwheels his arms and topples backwards into --

THE SHAFT

and just floats there Weightless Wile E- fucking-Coyote
over a drop of five or six stories

His legs enter one of the beams of light and start to
fall causing him to spin over and over

Matt flails his arms and in effect swims through the
air away from that light beam -- and into the other

This one carries him up all the way to --

THE NEXT LEVEL

Matt frantically grabs the lip of the floor and swings
himself right out of the shaft He SLAMS down on the deck
once again affected by gravity

This corridor is much like the last one

Matt gets up and runs away from the shaft

But he doesnt get far before his oxygen-starved muscles
protest He stumbles over a ridge and CRASHES to the deck

Thats when he hears those FOOTSTEPS again Whatever it
is its followed him up to this level

Matt tries to stand but cant do it So he crawls to the
inner wall and hides in the shadow of a structural support

As he gasps for air Matt leans out and peers back to see --
A nightmarish shape approaching

In the hard overhead light and deep shadow of the corridor
its really only a silhouette but thats scary enough

This is no machine This is an ALIEN straight up

It has two long spindly segmented arms that it uses to
cling to the ridges in the floor and haul itself forward
like a bizarre primate

The arms are at least six feet long and have two elbows
each -- clearly the model for the huge mechanical Claws

The alien stands eight feet tall and must weigh 500 pounds
yet it moves with grace And its coming this way -- fast

Matt takes one last gulp of air and gets to his feet

He runs forward as fast and as quietly as his buckling
legs will take him all the while keeping to the shadows

With enough distance between them the curve of the
corridor keeps him out of view of the alien But his legs
are giving out again Just then up ahead --

Another airlock looms into view

Matt runs for it and tries to jump for the controls but
he ends up missing and collapses to his knees

The FOOTSTEPS of the alien grow louder

Matt stands up and jumps for the buttons but only hits
one of them Then hes down on all fours again

And the FOOTSTEPS close in

Again Matt pulls himself to his feet But now he can
barely stand let alone jump

Behind him one arm of the alien is now visible around
the shallow curve

Matt ignores the fire in his muscles and jumps He slaps
both buttons and the door HISSES open and he falls into --

THE AIRLOCK
the door closing behind him
The FOOTSTEPS draw closer Pausing just outside the door

Matt crouches below the window pulling in his legs making
himself as small as possible

He looks up at the glass on the other door to check the
reflection of the window above him and he sees --

Amassive misshapen eye staring into the airlock

Then it vanishes along with the fading FOOTSTEPS

INT MECHANICAL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

The inner airlock door HISSES open and Matt collapses
into a dark space sucking in the breathable air

Somewhere nearby people are SCREAMING

Matt rises to his knees to see where he is

Another catwalk in another utility area -- this one home
to various inexplicable mechanical devices

As Matt recovers he stands and follows those voices

They lead him to a huge translucent sphere hanging from
the ceiling through an iris in the floor

Matt peers through the iris down at --

THE AIRPLANE

in the bay underneath him

This mechanical Claw reaches down from the split-open
sphere to the tail of the aircraft apparently trying to

tear open the emergency exit

Passengers are pouring out of the main door tumbling
down the chute and taking cover beneath the fuselage

A second Claw snatches up a female passenger It folds
and pulls her up into --

A SECOND GLOWING SPHERE
near another catwalk about fifty feet away from Matt

It SLIDES away on its overhead track the SCREAMING woman
a vague flailing form inside the translucent sphere

And Matt can do nothing for her but watch in horror as
shes spirited away to some other part of the ship

Matt squeezes between the sphere and the edge of the iris
and he drops onto the tail section of the pitched airplane
INT AIRPLANE BAY -- CONTINUOUS

Thirty or more passengers are huddled together in a
terrified mass beneath the fuselage They SCREAM as --

Matt drops down off the fuselage and LANDS beside them

PERKY FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Where did you come from

Matts seat mate the Gray-Haired Businessman spots him

GRAY-HAIRED BUSINESSMAN
Hey You went through that doorway
Whats in there What happened to
the others

MATT
You dont want to know
(MORE)

MATT (CONTD)
(to Perky)
Listen wheres the supply tank
for the emergency oxygen masks

PERKY FLIGHT ATTENDANT
The supply tank Why do you want --

MATT
Oxygen I need oxygen

PERKY FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Well we carry canisters for medical
emergencies -- but theyre in the
aft galley so
Matt looks over at the crowd coming down the chute

He gets a running start and bounds up the edge of the
chute while people are sliding down the center

He grabs the edge of the doorway but cant get through
the crush of people Finally a woman leaps onto the chute
and Matt steps into the space she left behind

INT FLIGHT 209 FIRST CLASS CABIN -- CONTINUOUS

The cabin is jam-packed with people up front and in the
aisles but the coach section appears to be empty

Matt climbs over the seats making his way aft He reaches
a BIG WOMAN at the back of the crowd staring into coach

MATT
What are we dealing with here

The Big Woman turns to him the fear of God in her eyes

MATT (CONTD)
Can I get back there

BIG WOMAN
You want to go back there

She just stares at him So Matt edges past her into --
THE COACH CABIN
He starts up the pitched aisle strewn with debris

BIG WOMAN (CONTD)
Mister dont do it

Something catches Matts eye as he passes a row of seats --

A dead body Mutilated

Further aft an OLD MAN stands up in an empty row -- except
that hes dead blood pouring from his mouth and nose

Hes been impaled by one stinger of the tendril that snakes
up the aisle from the aft galley emanating from the Claw
thats got a hold of the emergency exit back there

The stinger lets the corpse slide off of it and fall to
the floor Then the whole Tendril lunges toward Matt one
head darting through the air like a cobra the other three
acting as paws pulling itself along by the seat tops

Matt races back down the narrow aisle but --

He trips on a suitcase and falls He rolls over just as --

A dagger-like stinger comes stabbing towards him Matt
grabs it with both hands but it takes all his might to
keep it from tearing his face off Then --

The Tendril WINDS UP reeling Matt in like a big fish
dragging him up the aisle again all the way to --

THE AFT GALLEY

where the slack in the Tendrils length is now WINDING
furiously through the porthole of the emergency exit

Matt SLAMS into the bulkhead and wrestles with the Tendril
He gets a hold of two of the heads but must bob and weave
as the other two try to stab and slice him

One gets a piece of his forearm a nice clean gash

Matt holds the two heads with one hand and grabs another
He gets a hold of the fourth one and tries to pin them
all together clutching them with both arms

But it just adds to their strength They THRASH him around
SLAMMING him against the floor and the bulkhead

Matt pulls a fire extinguisher off the wall and SMASHES
it down on the Tendril but it barely seems to notice

He grabs a full coffee pot and douses all four stingers
but they are unaffected And worse -- now theyre wet and
slippery The Tendril tears free from Matts grasp

Matt rolls aside just before the Tendril stabs into the
lavatory door behind him It pulls itself free and all
four stingers draw a bead on Matt but --

Matt gives them a BLAST from the extinguisher The stingers
FLAIL about trying to shake off the chemical dust

Matt takes that opportunity to search the galley He spots --

A cabinet marked with a red cross He flings it open to
find oxygen tanks a first aid kit and a portable
defibrillator That last one gives him pause but --

The Tendril lunges again and Matt just barely avoids it
He grabs the defibrillator and stumbles back into --

THE LAVATORY
kicking the door shut just before a stinger STABS it

Matt pulls the cover off the defibrillator which starts
TALKING to him in a calm recorded voice

DERIBBILATOR (VO)
Begin by removing all clothing
from the patients chest

The Tendril pulls itself free and STABS at the door again

DERIBBILATOR (VO)
-Take out white adhesive pads
and place them on the patients
chest as shown in the diagram

Matt pulls out the two wired pads and peels off the
adhesive backing just as --

The Tendril SMASHES through the thin lavatory door and --

Matt catches it with an adhesive pad in each hand pressing
the wired pads firmly to the stinger

DERIBBILATOR (VO CONTD)
Analyzing No one should touch
the patient Analyzing

The Tendril overpowers Matt forcing him against the wall

DERIBBILATOR (VO CONTD)
Shock advised Stay clear of
patient

Matt lets go and kicks open the folding door pinning the
stinger in place With the door open the other three
stingers come darting toward him but --

DERIBBILATOR (VO CONTD)
Press flashing orange button now

-- Matt hits the orange button on the defibrillator and

the entire Tendril THRASHES wildly SPARKS and fiery
tongues of energy shooting out of all four stingers

DERIBBILATOR (VO CONTD)
Delivering shock now

Matt covers his face until the Tendril falls limp

DERIBBILATOR (VO CONTD)
Shock delivered It is safe to
touch the patient Begin CPR
Matt kicks the patient away from him and exits to --
THE AFT GALLEY
to see the Tendril REELING back through the porthole

Matt grabs two of the limp stingers and threads them
through a meal cart He ties a sheet bend just as --

The Claw REELS its Tendril taut and the cart SLAMS into
the door trapping the Claw against the fuselage

Matt returns to the medical cabinet and pulls out three
small green oxygen tanks

He opens some drawers dumping their contents on the floor
until he finds a stash of seatbelt extenders

He grabs them all and wraps them around his waist
Hes about to leave when he remembers one last thing --
He digs through the meal cart and finds a butter knife

CUT TO

INT FIRST CLASS CABIN -- MOMENTS LATER

The passengers stare wide-eyed as Matt emerges from coach
carrying his bounty

MATT
You can go back to your seats
Its probably safer in here than
outside

INT AIRPLANE BAY -- CONTINUOUS

Matt pushes his way to the open airplane door He looks
back along the fuselage to see --

The Claw struggling in vain to unstick its Tendril from
the emergency exit

But the other Claw has returned It grabs a man in a YELLOW
RAIN SLICKER and hoists him up into the darkness

Matt slides down the evacuation chute The Copilot helps
Matt to his feet admiring Matts handiwork

MATT
Get everyone back inside -- and
dont let anybody else go down
that corridor

COPILOT
(re the oxygen bottles)
What are you doing with those

MATT
The captain and I are going to get
help Youre in charge now Dont
get yourself killed

The Copilot watches perplexed as Matt walks away

The Gray-Haired Businessman emerges from under the airplane
to intercept Matt on his way to the corridor

GRAY-HAIRED BUSINESSMAN
Hey are you going back in there
Im coming with you

MATT
Thats not a good idea

Matt tries to pull away from him but he clings

GRAY-HAIRED BUSINESSMAN
Then why are you going back in

Three BUSYBODIES come over to see whats going on

BUSYBODY 1
Hey buddy -- dont go in there
Nobody comes out

GRAY-HAIRED BUSINESSMAN
Hes already been in there
(to Matt)
Hey friend If youve got a plan
dont cut me out

Matt pulls free of Gray-Haired Businessman

MATT
Im not cutting you out Im trying
to help Get back on the plane

Matt continues toward the opening Gray-Haired Businessman
looks at the Busybodies then starts after Matt

MATT (CONTD)
(reels toward him)
Im serious You cant follow me
in there Youll die

Gray-Haired Businessman stops in his tracks and watches
as Matt disappears into the corridor

CUT TO

INT THE TORTURE CHAMBER -- MOMENTS LATER

The trap door SWINGS open and Matt drops out sliding
down to the platform -- now much more crowded

Matt scrambles to his feet to discover --

THE ENTIRE CHAMBER

is now lit up its vast expanse finally revealed

The platform sits in the center of this huge crescent
chamber -- like an amphitheater filled with numerous
perplexing torture devices And there are many more victims
lying about slaughtered by various creative means

A BLOODY MAN

tries to fend off the little vehicle with the WHIRLING
blades -- the mechanical gladiator Four other mutilated
victims lie about including Chris the flight attendant
The gladiator takes a run at the new guy slicing him

A MECHANICAL CLAW

emerges from its hemisphere and unfolds to deposit Yellow
Rain Slicker onto the platform He looks around terrified

BLACK T-SHIRT

is still imprisoned in his examination chair his mouth
frothing his leg a ruin of blood and pus

THE ROLLING SPHERE

in the floor is vacant The charred corpse of Asian Tourist
lies just beyond the energized prongs that cooked him

THE TRAP DOOR

BANGS open again and Gray-Haired Businessman and two of
the Busybodies spill down the long rib to the platform
They look around at all the mayhem speechless

Matt just looks at them and shakes his head

Marianne huddled near the center of the crowd almost
doesnt recognize Matt under all the filth and blood

MARIANNE
Oh my God

She throws her arms around him Matt stands there awkward

MATT
Wheres the captain

Marianne leads Matt toward the front of the crowd

MARIANNE
(re the Claws)
Theyre pulling people out of the
plane and bringing them in here
Why didnt they do that with Laney

She looks at him for an answer but he hasnt got one He
points to her lip now swollen and bloody

MATT
What happened here

She waves it off Its the least of her worries

They find the Captain talking to some passengers He looks
at Matt and does a double take

CAPTAIN
Where the hell did you come from

Matt pulls the Captain aside

MATT
I found a way out of this room and
I think I found a way to get help
But I need you to come with me
(re the floor)
--Through that hatch

CAPTAIN
I cant leave these people Find
somebody else

MATT
I need a pilot

The Captain looks at Matts oxygen bottles

CAPTAIN
What have you found Whats really
going on here

MATT
You know how sometimes things arent
as bad as they seem This isnt

one of those times You want to
help these people you gotta come
with me

CAPTAIN

(thinks it over)
Okay What do we do
MATT
Who has the gun

MARIANNE
I picked it up but he took it
away from me -- the fed

MATT
I need your gun

Agent Hay turns to see Matt and freezes solid

AGENT HAY
You

CAPTAIN
Come on Hay Quit hoarding that
gun Lets have it

AGENT HAY
That gun belongs to me
(pulls out his badge)
I remind you gentlemen that I ama
federal agent with the Bureau of --

MATT
Youre outside your jurisdiction

Matt grabs the badge and tosses away It flies through
the energized prongs and bursts into flames

MATT (CONTD)
Come on give me the gun

AGENT HAY
(sizes Matt up)
You found a way out of here
(re the Claw)
Youre going to shoot that thing
again so it throws you down that
hatch

MATT
Give me the gun

AGENT HAY
You want the gun you get me too
Its a package deal

CAPTAIN
Agent Hay Im telling you --

MARIANNE
-- Captain

The Claw comes up behind the Captain and snares him

She points to Agent Hay Matt starts toward him Marianne
and the Captain follow

MATT
No

Matt lunges for the Captain but its too late

The Claw drops the Captain onto the floor below The
mechanical gladiator rolls toward him blades SPINNING

MATT (CONTD)
Aw shit
(to Agent Hay)
Okay youre in But this is my
party Understand

Matt hands Marianne the six seatbelt extenders

MATT (CONTD)
Link these together into a chain

MARIANNE
Am -- am I coming

MATT
Unless you want to stay here

Matt rushes to the edge of the platform and watches as
the mechanical gladiator rushes toward the Captain

MATT (CONTD)
Captain Keep clear of that of
that thing

CAPTAIN
That was my plan

Matt doesnt notice that one of his oxygen bottles is
protruding through the energized prongs

MATT
Stay by that trap door and -- shit

He flinches and drops the cylinder the end of it now red-
hot Matt looks at it realizes what happened

MATT (CONTD)
Son of a bitch

THE CAPTAIN

just barely eludes the spinning blades and scurries away
from the mechanical gladiator But it closes in on him
again all of its many blades WHIRLING in a frenzy

MATT

picks up the still-hot tank with tentative hands

MATT (CONTD)
CAPTAIN GET DOWN

THE CAPTAIN

shoots Matt an uncertain look then hits the deck even
as the lethal machine comes barreling toward him

MATT

heaves the tank through the energized prongs White-hot
energy ZAPS the cylinder as it passes turning it instantly
into a glowing missile that flies into --

THE MACHINES WHIRLING BLADES

which bite into the red hot pressurized cylinder It --
EXPLODES blowing the machine apart

THE CROWD ON THE PLATFORM

shields their heads from the rain of debris and looks
down below to see that --

THE MECHANICAL GLADIATOR

has been effectively killed For the first time there
is silence in the torture chamber

The Captain gets up off the floor shaken but unharmed
The Claw descends to examine the wreckage
JANET

watching from the platform breaks the silence with a
raucous VICTORY CHEER The others join in

The Claw turns slowly toward the CHEERING humans

Agent Hay reaches for the Glock hidden in his waistband

AGENT HAY

What happens Do I shoot it now
MATT

I dont think thats going to be

necessary

Matt hooks the remaining oxygen bottles to his belt and
takes the 15-foot chain of seatbelts from Marianne

MATT (CONTD)
Everybody grab onto this and dont
let go no matter what
Agent Hay and Marianne grab onto the belts with Matt as --

The Claw lunges for Matt scooping him up off the platform

He strains with both hands to hold onto the chain of
seatbelts lifting Agent Hay and Marianne into the air --
and over the fence of energized prongs

MATT (CONTD)
Captain Get to the trap door

THE CAPTAIN
runs to the circular hatch just as --
The Claw drops the other three onto it and --

The hatch opens with a deafening RUSH OF AIR that sucks
them all down but --

Matt casts off the slack end of the seatbelt chain just
as hes pulled under The chain follows them down but --

The trap door SLAMS on the buckle of the very last belt

INT EJECTION TUBE -- CONTINUOUS

Matt Marianne Agent Hay and the Captain dangle down the
tube in a daisy chain clinging to the seatbelts as wind
TEARS at them until the unseen hatch below BANGS shut

MARIANNE
Are we alive

Matt lets go and slides down to --

The closed hatch He pulls out his butter knife and easily
pries open the air duct panel

CUT TO

INT LIFEBOAT -- LATER

The other ships in this fleet float in space a sinister
string of pearls encircling the Earth

Marianne stands at the windscreen of the lifeboat soaking
in that sight Jaw slack Huffing 02 from an oxygen mask

Agent Hay stands guard at the closed airlock clutching
his Glock like a security blanket in his trembling hand

The Captain studies the controls Matt at his side

They all take turns puffing oxygen from the tanks passing
the masks back and forth as needed

MATT
Come on tell me you can do this
CAPTAIN
(shakes his head)
I dont think so

Marianne looks at the crazy symbols on the control

MARIANNE
How will you even know what button
to push

MATT

Think of it like a puzzle You
look for patterns Math is
universal Numbers add up the same
way in any language A machine
built anywhere in the galaxy has
to deal with the same laws of
physics that we do --

CAPTAIN
Like gravity
(that shuts him up)
Were in orbit right now Why arent
we weightless

MATT
Because theyre somehow
generating their own gravitational
field or Okay their technology
is more sophisticated than ours
but its not magic We can figure
it out

CAPTAIN
Youre awfully optimistic uh I
dont even know your name

MATT
Matt

CAPTAIN
Listen Matt Ive never flown
outside the atmosphere Its an
entirely separate discipline You
dont use control surfaces --

MATT
Right you use reactive controls

CAPTAIN
Well excuse me but I dont know
how to do that I dont know how
to plot a reentry trajectory or
aerobrake without disintegrating
Its suicide Ill get us killed

AGENT HAY
Were already dead

panel

They all look behind them at Hay

AGENT HAY (CONTD)
You think this shits gonna get
any better Ill gladly take my
chances with an amateur astronaut
before I go back in there

MATT
(re the other ships)
Captain do you see how many of
these things there are Whatever
their plan is you can bet it
involves more than a handful of
airplanes

The Captain looks at the wreckage floating past He nods

CAPTAIN
Okay Ill try I guess Ill try

MARIANNE
Well let me out first

She starts for the airlock but Agent Hay is in her way

AGENT HAY
Where are you going

MATT
To look for her daughter

Marianne just nods toward Matt What he said

MATT (CONTD)
The thing is

Marianne looks back at Matt

MARIANNE
The thing is
Matt looks at her in the eye and backpedals
MATT

Listen this is a big ship and we
dont even know where to start
looking The best way to help Laney
is to get back down to earth and
tell them whats going on

MARIANNE
And what are they going to do
Send up a SWAT team in the space
shuttle

(MORE )

MARIANNE (CONTD)
(re the Captain)
Look even if he can figure out
how to fly us home lets not kid
ourselves Nobodys coming back to
save the others

MATT
Maybe so But there are six billion
people down there and the fight
is coming to them They need to
know what theyre up against

MARIANNE
Youre leaving strangers behind
you can afford to be cold-blooded
about this But I cant leave my
daughter You dont need to stay
and help me find her

She steps around Agent Hay and heads to the airlock but

MATT
Wait

Marianne turns to him again but he still cant say it

AGENT HAY
I think what hes getting at is
shes probably already dead

MARIANNE
You dont know that

AGENT HAY
After all theyve done to us you
think they kept your girl alive

MARIANNE
(appealing to Matt)
Its like you said -- theyre
testing us Maybe they took Laney

to see how Id react -- to see if
they can control us by threatening
our children Well the answer

is yes They can

Matt looks into her moist eyes and is about to speak but --

CAPTAIN

Ill help you look for her
AGENT HAY

-- What are you kidding
CAPTAIN

Im about to abandon most of my

passengers
(MORE)
CAPTAIN (CONTD)
Cant I spend ten minutes trying
to save one little girl first
The Captain pushes past Agent Hay and opens the airlock

MATT
Shes dead

Marianne turns to Matt shocked to hear this from him

MARIANNE
I wont believe it till I see for --

MATT
I saw her
MARIANNE
(shakes her head)
Youre lying You just want to

get out of here

MATT
I saw it happen

CAPTAIN
Where Can you show us

MATT
Shes not there anymore They took
her away
MARIANNE
Oh I see
MATT
Marianne shes dead
MARIANNE

Right Like your wife

She nods toward Matts left hand then steps into the
airlock with the Captain

MATT
Captain --

CAPTAIN
We wont go far Maybe sweep this
level Ten minutes tops
(to Marianne)
Then Im coming back here

Marianne nods

Matt wants to argue but sees the futility in it He looks

at Agent Hay Hay gives him a shrug Good try

Matt shakes his head and gestures for Hay to get into the
airlock Hay stares at him but obliges

CUT TO

INT A DARK ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Darkness and the HUM of electronics A door HISSES open
and Matt and Agent Hay are silhouetted in the doorway
Hay sweeps the room with his Glock

Its some kind of mechanical space -- lots of machines
and soft glowing lights But no signs of life

INT LOWER DECK CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS

Agent Hay backs out so Matt can CLOSE the door They rejoin
the Captain and Marianne and continue stalking down the
long curving corridor buddying up on the oxygen tanks

The Captain catches Matt checking his watch

CAPTAIN
Youre a good guy to share a foxhole
with Matt What are you anyway
Cop Ex-military Jason Bourne

MATT
Senior design engineer for DarkStar
Telecom

The Captain chuckles thinks Matt is putting him on

MATT (CONTD)
I build satellites

The Captain stops laughing It all makes sense now Hes
a rocket scientist

CAPTAIN
Well stop checking your watch
okay

MATT

Okay but times almost up
The Captain nods toward Earth out the slit windows
CAPTAIN
You got any kids waiting for you
down there
Matt catches Marianne watching him He looks at his ring
MATT

My wife and I were expecting when
we got carjacked at a gas station
AGENT HAY
Jesus What happened

Matt takes a breath of oxygen shrugs

MATT
Guy put a gun in my face said he
wanted the car So I got out and
gave it to him

AGENT HAY
Wise move

MATT
Except I didnt realize he also
wanted my wife Otherwise Id
have made sure she got out first
because all he had to do was jump
in and grab her by the hair

MARIANNE
Oh my God What did you

MATT
I was on the wrong side of the
car Couldnt get to her door before
he threw it in gear and Anyway
No I dont have any kids

CAPTAIN
Fuck me

They arrive at the zero G shaft

CAPTAIN (CONTD)
Whats this

MATT
Thats the elevator

The Captain gives him a quizzical look They slowly
approach and look up to see the epic size of the ship

CAPTAIN
Wow Okay so how do you call
the elevator car

Matt shows the Captain his watch

CAPTAIN (CONTD)
One more level

Matt looks into Mariannes pleading eyes and relents

He steps out over the void Marianne gasps and lunges to
save him but hes already floating away

AGENT HAY
Son Of A Bitch

MATT
Come on

He guides the others as they step one-by-one into the
shaft -- and immediately flounder in the weightlessness

Matt swims into a light beam and is drawn upward

INT ELEVATOR SHAFT -- CONTINUOUS

As the Captain Marianne and Agent Hay follow Matt up the
light beam he prepares to get off at the next level but --

TWO ALIENS are partway down that corridor conferring
with one another -- not looking toward the shaft

Matt signals the others to follow him further up

As Matt reaches the next level he looks out to see --

A CLUSTER OF ALIENS gathered outside an overflowing room

ahundred feet away Somethings going on in there

Matt signals the others to keep quiet but Marianne hisses

MARIANNE
Matt

Shes pointing above him He looks up to see --

Several more ALIENS leaping into the shaft 20 stories up

Matt gives everyone the kill signal He grabs the edge
of the shaft and --
INT THREE LEVELS UP -- CONTINUOUS

-- flips out of the zero G field SLAMMING to the deck of
the next level He takes a quick look around

Its empty
The Captain arrives and joins Matt

Marianne doesnt time it right and comes out eight feet
off the floor Matt catches her They both go down hard

Agent Hay follows her and goes rolling across the deck

AGENT HAY
Did you see those things Jesus

Agent Hay fumbles for Matts oxygen mask and takes a huff

MATT
The question is did they see us
Lets get clear of this shaft

CUT TO

INT THREE LEVELS UP CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER

They round the shallow curve and Matt brings them to a
stop so they can listen for approaching footsteps Marianne
is short of breath Matt gives her some oxygen

MARIANNE
What were they doing -- that big
group down below

MATT
I think were above the torture
chamber now Those guys might be
looking down in there -- observers

The Captain walks further on to examine an airlock door
CAPTAIN
Even up here they still separate
the atmosphere with this bulkhead
Marianne and Agent Hay arent sure what hes getting at
CAPTAIN (CONTD)
If theyre keeping your girl alive
she needs breathable air

INT THE CRYO-BAY -- MOMENTS LATER

The airlock HISSES open revealing Matt Marianne the
Captain and Agent Hay They test the air Its breathable

They stow their oxygen masks and step out onto a catwalk
in the dimly lit space Matt looks up

MATT
Oh boy

Its a dizzying 50 stories straight up A cylindrical
chamber that must take up most of the ship

The space is filled with many thousands of huge glass
tubes stacked on top of one another all the way up Layers
of catwalks provide access to all of them

MARIANNE
What is this the engine room

CAPTAIN
Maybe the cargo hold

AGENT HAY
What kind of cargo

Matt approaches one of the tubes he peers through the
glass into the darkness within

MATT
I dont see anything

MARIANNE
Those ones are lit up

She points to a stack of tubes further ahead -- with
glowing panels at the foot of each

Matt starts toward them but looks back at Agent Hay

MATT
Bring the gun please

Agent Hay tightens his grip on the Glock and follows Matt

As they approach the lit-up tubes light refracting through
them immediately betrays the presence of liquid inside

Matt studies the glowing panel Status lights on a display

He shades his eyes and peers into the tube The moment he
touches the glass it lights up from within revealing --

A hideous face staring back at him

Matt recoils nearly toppling off of the catwalk Agent
Hay helps him stay upright

Marianne and the Captain approach and study the tremendous
motionless animal inside the tube Not of this earth

AGENT HAY
One of them
MATT
No its a whole other kind

Its ferocious looking Huge claws and mandibles
Definitely high up on whatever food chain it came from

AGENT HAY
God save us

MARIANNE
Think its dead

MATT
Then why handcuff it

The others look where Matts looking -- at the thick alloy
shackles binding the beasts appendages

The Captain looks at the display Monitoring life signs

CAPTAIN
Must be in some kind of hibernation

The Captain looks up at this stack of pods the active
displays on all of them indicating creatures within

Then he turns and sees that the vast majority of the tubes
have inactive displays

CAPTAIN (CONTD)
There must be a million pods in

this ship

MATT
And God knows how many ships there
are

Matt and the Captain share a look

AGENT HAY
I dont get it What am I missing
MATT
(to the Captain)
Is this a slave ship Are they

slave traders

CAPTAIN
(re the unlit pods)
I dont know but theyve got a
lot of cargo space to fill

Matt looks up at the countless inactive pods then back
at the hibernating beast before them

AGENT HAY
So all that
(air quotes)
---studying down there Theyre
not just trying to figure out how
to defeat us

CAPTAIN
They already know they can defeat
us Look at their technology

Nobody notices that Matt is onto something He looks up
and down the catwalk zeroing in on an occupied pod in a
sea of empty ones

He starts toward it The others follow but are distracted
by their ongoing discussion

CAPTAIN (CONTD)
They want to see how easy we are
to control What were useful for
(MORE )

CAPTAIN (CONTD)

Theyre studying everything about
us Our biology our endurance
our intelligence

(re the torture

chamber down below)
Everything we do down there provides
them with knowledge they can use --
not just the experiments but how
we react to them Those big
magnifying lenses Maybe theyre
for our benefit so they can see
what we do when --

MATT
Marianne

Marianne the Captain and Agent Hay suddenly realize that
Matt has stopped before them his hand resting on a pod
now illuminated from within

Marianne approaches the pod and SCREAMS at the sight of --

Laneys bound body floating upside-down in fluid

MATT (CONTD)
Shes alive -- I think shes alive
I saw them do this I thought she
was dead but they must have been
testing this fluid on her and --
(looks at Marianne)
Jesus Im sorry

Marianne pounds on the glass
MARIANNE
Laney Laney can you hear me How
do we get in there

Matt and the Captain search for some way to open the pod

AGENT HAY
Stand back -- Ill shoot the glass

MATT
No you wont

Marianne kneels before the display panel

MARIANNE
Tell me shes alive -- Please God
tell me shes alive I cant read
this fucking thing

Matt kneels beside Marianne studies the panel He taps
the screen It flashes red He tries it again

MARIANNE (CONTD)
How do we open it Matt How do we
get her out

MATT
I dont know The controls seem to
be locked

He finds a small slot alongside the screen studies it

MATT (CONTD)
I think it takes a key Maybe we
can hot-wire it

MARIANNE
Hurry up please

Matt taps the hollow metal body of the pod Finds a seam
Digs at it with his fingernails but it stays put

He backs up and gives it a few good KICKS denting the
metal and spreading the seam open

MATT
Give me a hand

Matt the Captain and Agent Hay squeeze their fingers
into the gap and TEAR the entire control panel loose
exposing a tangle of narrow tubing and filaments

Theyre like the vines hes seen everywhere else but on
a smaller scale Seems almost organic like veins growing
thinner with each offshoot

MARIANNE
Hang in there Laney

Matt studies the colored fluid pumping slowly through the
tubing into a board of interconnected channels

MATT
Its like a circuit board

CAPTAIN
Not like any Ive ever seen

Matt points to the two different colors of fluid pumping
through the brachiated vein-like tubes

MATT
Positive and negative -- maybe
its that simple Just have to
bypass the lock

He pinches a tube and breaks it off of its connection He
does the same with another then reroutes the first tube
to the second connection

But when he lets go of the second tube fluid spurts onto
the catwalk sending up SPARKS He pinches it shut

MATT (CONTD)
I need some way to clamp it Anybody
have a paper clip or a
(sees his own hand)
Hey I got it

He slips off his wedding band folds the tube over and
slides the ring onto the tube to keep it shut

He flips the panel around and taps the screen The graphics
respond to his touch

Matt kneels before the panel and studies the graphical
representation of the pod He touches it in a few places
but nothing happens He tries rubbing his finger against
the pod door as if to slide it open and --

A display of Laneys vital signs flashes and BEEPS
And little Laneys eyes open up

MARIANNE
Oh my God Laney

Laney starts writhing inside the tube disoriented and
terrified to discover that shes breathing fluid

MARIANNE (CONTD)
Get her out Get her out

A valve somewhere inside CLACKS open and an unseen pump
starts CHURNING fluid out of the pod

As it clears Laneys face she coughs it out of her lungs

MARIANNE (CONTD)
Hold on baby Were going to get
you out of there

The pod door CRACKS open and HISSES up and out of the
way Marianne leaps inside slipping in the remaining
goo She clutches her slimy daughter and sobs

Matt plays with the controls some more and --

The alloy shackles CLICK open Laney falls into her
mothers arms The two of them slip to the floor of the
pod soaked with goo but thrilled to be reunited

The Captain helps them onto the catwalk where Marianne
crouches and holds her little girl and shuts her own eyes
against the weird alien world all around them concerned
for the moment only with having her daughter back

MARIANNE (CONTD)
Oh my baby are you okay

LANEY
Mommy Mommy

Matt retrieves his wedding band and the three men back
away to give Marianne and Laney this moment

The Captain quietly sobs No scratch that Hes chuckling

AGENT HAY
Whats so goddamn funny

CAPTAIN
Oh I was just thinking They
want to study us right So they
scoop up a plane full of people --
a random sampling of human beings
(pats Matt shoulder)

But what are the odds theres a
goddamn genius on that plane who
could outsmart them

MATT
Lets not get cocky Were talking
about a race that can control
gravity and do God knows what else

Marianne stands to join the men holding Laneys hand

MARIANNE
Well they couldnt stop you from
saving my little girl

MATT
That was blind luck

MARIANNE
All the same

Marianne plants a kiss on his cheek but he just stares
at her the blood draining from his face

MARIANNE (CONTD)
Whats the matter

Matt looks around the huge chamber the innumerable pods

MATT

This is more than luck This is
winning the goddamn lottery

(he looks at the others)
They could have put her anywhere
in here but they put her right
down at the bottom

(off their blank looks)
They let us find her

CAPTAIN
Why would they do that

MATT
(shrugs )
To see if we could To see if wed
even try

CAPTAIN
Youre saying they let us escape

MATT
Im saying we didnt escape at
all We got out of that godawful
room but were still being studied

AGENT HAY
They know were here Theyve been
watching us this whole time You
give ‘em way too much credit

Matts eyes wander around the great chamber settling on
the darkened pods in the next catwalk twenty feet away

MATT
I dont think so

Those dark glass doors HISS open

MATT (CONTD)
Behind the pods Now

Matt pulls Marianne and Laney through the tight space
between two tubes because --

A DOZEN ALIENS

spring out of those pods Each one has two small appendages
that fold out of their backs and point forward

The appendages pump back and forth FIRING tracer-like
projectile rounds that EXPLODE upon impact

MATT MARIANNE AND LANEY

make it through to the next catwalk and crouch behind a
pod as rounds BURST against it

THE CAPTAIN AND AGENT HAY

are still struggling to get through Agent Hay drops onto
his back and FIRES his Glock taking out --

ONE OF THE ALIENS

with a clean head shot but --

THE CAPTAIN

takes an EXPLODING round to the thigh It sends out a

small web of sticky fluid that eats into his flesh like
white phosphorous spreading under the skin

He falls down screaming Matt drags him onto --
THE NEXT CATWALK
but the FUSILLADE pins them all down

Laney is screaming Marianne clutching her Agent Hay
tries to fire again but cant get another opening

Matt checks the Captain The projectile has burned a deep
furrow in the flesh of his leg

MATT (CONTD)
Shit -- you okay

The Captain musters a brave face and nods

MATT (CONTD)
Can you fly

CAPTAIN
Im gonna have to arent I

MATT
Thats the spirit

Matt points to an airlock door at the end of this catwalk

MATT (CONTD)
That way on three One Two Three

Agent Hay leads the way his stout frame really moving
Marianne picks up Laney and follows hard on his heels
Matt pulls the Captain along but they move much slower
The aliens track them through the gaps between the pods

Another round HITS the Captain in the back He tries to
scream but falls breathless to the catwalk

Matt drops behind the next pod to assess the damage The
caustic web is still SIZZLING through muscle tissue

MATT (CONTD)
Talk to me -- you gonna make it

The Captain shakes his head

MATT (CONTD)
Yes you are Come on

AGENT HAY MARIANNE AND LANEY
reach the sheltered landing of the airlock and look back

MARIANNE
Oh no

AGENT HAY
Forget it -- lets go

MARIANNE
No Wait

MATT

grabs the Captain and pulls him behind the next pod but
the Captain is totally limp now no help at all

MATT
Come on the human race needs you

The Captain tries to choke out some words but fails
AT THE AIRLOCK LANDING
Agent Hay jumps for the controls and opens the door

AGENT HAY
Come on Get in

MARIANNE
Wait for them

Agent Hay is in a full panic now He dives into the airlock
and triggers it The door HISSES shut

MARIANNE (CONTD)
No You bastard

Marianne jumps and hits the controls but theyre locked
because Agent Hay is fleeing through the outer door

MATT

hoists the Captain over his shoulder and lumbers down the
catwalk as rounds EXPLODE all around them

He reaches the landing and collapses at Mariannes feet

The airlock REPRESSURIZES and Marianne gets it open She
ushers Laney in then helps Matt drag the Captain into --

THE AIRLOCK
but its obviously too late for the Captain

MATT
Captain Captain Can you hear me

He lifts the Captains face to see his lifeless eyes

MATT (CONTD)
Oh fuck

Marianne jumps and hits the controls just before --

Rounds start HAMMERING the inner door The aliens have
reached this catwalk and are headed toward the airlock

INT THREE LEVELS UP CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS

The outer door HISSES open and Marianne and Laney spill
out Matt follows them but reaches back inside to pull
the Captains body across the threshold

He leaves the dead man there -- a human doorstop He grabs
Mariannes hand and pulls her and Laney down the corridor

MATT
Wheres whats-his-face

MARIANNE
He took off

The outer airlock door tries to close but BUMPS into the
Captains body preventing the inner door from opening

MATT MARIANNE AND LANEY

run as hard as they can away from the sound of the aliens
SHOOTING their way through the airlock windows

Laney cant keep up so Marianne scoops her off her feet
and carries her as a SHRILL ALARM echoes through the ship

They run blindly the threat of danger always just around
the continuous bend of the circular hallway

Marianne trips on a ridge and drops Laney onto the floor
Matt doubles back picks up Laney and theyre off again
A zero G shaft looms into view but --

Some aliens are riding up the light beam

Matt throws on the brakes pulls Marianne behind a pillar

Matt sets Laney down and Marianne hugs her close All of
them panting like racehorses And the ALARM still screams

MARIANNE (CONTD)
-- What do we do -- Where are we
even going

Matt tries to think of an answer Marianne hugs Laneys
head against her breast but what shes really doing is
covering the girls ears while she whispers at Matt

MARIANNE (CONTD)
This is it isnt it

MATT
Dont say that --

MARIANNE
We dont have a pilot We dont
have a gun We cant get off this --

MATT
The copilot

MARIANNE
What

MATT

Hell fly the lifeboat

MARIANNE
The copilot In the airplane How
are we going get him out here

MATT
We can uh -- I can -- Theres one
of those big claws stuck to the
airplane Maybe we can -- just
climb up its body and

But even Matt isnt buying this plan He looks around the
pillar to avoid Mariannes hopeless stare but sees --

Two more aliens floating down the shaft

He ducks back behind the pillar frozen He looks at
Marianne cradling her baby

MATT (CONTD)
Okay heres the plan You ever
been to Muir Woods up in Mill
Valley

MARIANNE
Uh I dont think so

MATT
Thats where theyve got those
really big redwoods Some of them
are over a thousand years old

MARIANNE
Right okay What about them

MATT
Laneys got to see those Shed
really get a kick out them

MARIANNE
Okay but -- whats the plan

MATT
That is the plan Id like to take
you guys there sometime Its not
a very long drive And its really
something you ought to see

Marianne smiles realizes what hes doing
MARIANNE
Is this like when the best friends
talk about what theyre going to
do after the wars over but then
one of them gets killed in the
next scene
Matt puts a gentle hand on her cheek
MATT
No Were getting out of this I
promise you Were getting out of
this and then Im going to show
you some big-ass trees
Marianne is still terrified but at least shes laughing

MARIANNE
Okay okay

Matt leans around the pillar again
The elevator shaft is empty
MATT
The way back to the plane is just
two floors down so were going to
run for it and were not going to
look back Everybody with me

Marianne nods Matt looks at Laney She nods too

MATT (CONTD)
--Now

He picks up Laney and they sprint for the open shaft but --
A HALF-DOZEN ALIENS appear behind them and start FIRING

MATT (CONTD)
Dont look back

But Marianne does -- and stumbles on the uneven floor
Laney is facing backwards in Matts arms so she can see --

Marianne desperately trying to regain her footing the
mob of aliens lumbering after her

LANEY
Mommy

Matt spins around to look but --

MARIANNE
Go Get her out of here

Marianne tries to get back on her feet but --
Around HITS the floor nearby SPATTERING her jacket with

its caustic web Marianne falls again struggling to twist
her way out of the jacket before that shit burns her

Laney screams Matt races forward He slides across the
floor like a man stealing third and flies into --

THE ZERO G SHAFT

into the down light beam Matt turns so that Laney faces
away from --

HER MOTHER

who gets out of the jacket but cant possibly escape
from the half-dozen rampaging aliens descending upon her

MATT AND LANEY
float down away from one horror -- and toward another
More aliens are piling into the shaft two stories below

Matt grabs the lip of the next level and --

INT OBSERVATION LEVEL CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS
-- the two of them land one floor shy of their goal

LANEY
-- Mommy

MATT
Shhh

Matt scoops up Laney again and carries her past --
The room full of aliens they saw earlier and --

Down the hallway as fast as he can But as they round
the slow bend of the corridor they come up behind --

Another group of armed aliens

Matt hugs the inside wall to quickly get out of their
line of sight He doubles back and finds a closed door

He plays with the electronic controls until the door HISSES
open and Matt finds himself staring down the barrel of --

Agent Hays Glock Hay lowers the barrel and --

AGENT HAY
Matt Jesus--

-- Matt SMASHES him in the face knocking him back into --

INT STORAGE COMPARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

-- the small dim room cluttered with crates and racks of
weird objects Matt carries Laney in and CLOSES the door

Hay sits up and spits blood seething

AGENT HAY
What was I supposed to do
MATT
Right now you better find a place

to hide
Matt pulls a rack of what looks like alien armor away
from the wall and secretes Laney behind it He crouches
down with her and adjusts the rack to conceal them both

Theres a sound of LOPING FOOTSTEPS approaching

AGENT HAY
You led em here

Agent Hay scrambles about in a furious search for a hiding
place He dives behind a large crate just before --

The door HISSES open and TWO ALIENS lean in
MATT AND LANEY

huddle as low as they can holding their breath
THE ALIENS

scan the room quick and efficient but thankfully not
too thorough They CLOSE the door Their FOOTSTEPS recede

After a silent moment

Agent Hay stands up and listens He comes out into the
middle of the room and sinks down onto a box

AGENT HAY (CONTD)
Wheres the kids mother She buy
it too

BEHIND THE RACK

Matt cringes at the question He looks at Laney a sweet
little girl with a thousand-yard stare She trembles

Matt puts an arm around her and feeds her oxygen from his
tank but she doesnt even seem aware of his presence

The ALARM goes silent Matt sits up Are they in the clear

He kicks the rack away so he can see Agent Hay sitting
there gun dangling from his hand impotent

He looks up at the rack and pulls down something like a
backpack with two insectoid legs folded against it

Its an alien gun Theyre not part of the aliens’ biology
just weapons worn on their backs

LANEY
(a whisper)
Is there a Heaven

Matt looks down at Laney Shes still staring into space
taking occasional puffs off the oxygen mask

MATT
I dont know I hope so

LANEY
Ill see my mom there right

MATT
(what can he say)
Yeah

LANEY
And youll see your wife

Matt doesnt respond

AGENT HAY
Bet shell want to have a word
about that day at the gas station

Matt looks at Agent Hay Then he stands up about ready
to kill the son of a bitch with his bare hands but --

The corridor outside echoes with DEEP BARKING VOICES
Then the sound of aliens THUNDERING up and down the
corridor The ship is filling up with aliens on the hunt

Matt looks back at the alien weapon in his hands He plays
with it trying to suss out how it functions

AGENT HAY (CONTD)
Just dont judge me is all Youre
no different Or do I need to remind
you that your great and noble plan
woulda got you off this ship while
all those other people were left
to die

MATT
What was I supposed to do I was
trying to get help --

AGENT HAY
Hey Id have played it the same
way Thats my point If you dont
look after yourself you wont be
around to help anyone else

Matt tries to respond but cant Agent Hay shrugs

AGENT HAY (CONTD)
Were only human

LANEY
Lizards

Matt and Agent Hay look back at Laney Still tear-stained
Still trembling Still staring into the middle distance

LANEY (CONTD)
Were only lizards And whatever
these things are well never beat
them Not with our lizard brains

Matt wants to respond to reassure her But what could he
say Anyway shes not waiting for a response

Matt turns back to the weapon extending one of the barrels
in the same pumping motion that it makes when it fires
It CLICKS but doesnt shoot He tries it again

He pops open a cover between the shoulder blade-like
appendages to reveal a large chamber -- empty

He tosses the weapon aside and leads Agent Hay away from
Laney for a private chat

MATT

How many rounds do you have left
AGENT HAY

More than enough
MATT

For what
AGENT HAY

For what you have in mind
MATT

Im not asking you to put a bullet
in my head you asshole I want

the gun
AGENT HAY
--Why
MATT
Because fuck these things thats
why

Matt pries the Glock out of Agent Hays feeble grasp

AGENT HAY
Were toast Matt What are you
gonna take over the whole ship
with a dozen rounds

MATT
No But maybe I can shut down that
torture chamber

AGENT HAY
Maybe And then what do you think
theyll do to you

MATT

Same thing theyll do when they

find me in here It just happens

sooner thats all

Agent Hay thinks that over and finds he cant argue
MATT (CONTD)
(re Laney)
Keep her company Stay with her
till the end

AGENT HAY
OKay

Matt presses the barrel of the Glock against Hays heart

MATT
Do not Leave her Alone

AGENT HAY
Hey Im not going anywhere

Matt takes Hays oxygen cylinder and crosses back to Laney
He crouches beside her

MATT
Sweetheart Um Im going outside
for a little while Im not sure
how long Ill be but --

LANEY
Kill as many as you can

She looks right at him with those rapidly aging eyes

CUT TO

INT OBSERVATION LEVEL CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER

BLURRED SHAPES march past the closed storage compartment
door and down the corridor The door SLIDES open Matt
emerges from the darkness within the Glock in two hands
He looks left after the receding aliens Then right at --

The empty corridor

Matt springs out of the room and sprints down the hall
the door HISSING shut behind him

He runs for the crowded room they passed earlier

He slows as he approaches it stealthy He steps to the
edge of the doorway He takes a deep puff of oxygen and
spins around the doorframe to find --

INT THE OBSERVATION ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

-- the room is nearly empty now Just THREE FIGURES huddled
over a console their backs to the door Unaware of Matt

This is the observation room that looks down through the
high windows in the torture chamber The floor is tiered
a gallery for observers

The three aliens are perched at the glass working the
elaborate controls before them ALIEN TECHNICIANS

Ropy umbilical cords dangle from the ceiling connecting
to each alien at the center of their backs They are
physically part of the controls

Matt swallows and edges into the room coming around behind
the three aliens As he approaches he can see down into --

THE TORTURE CHAMBER

corpses and gore littering the blood-soaked floor Dozens
of passengers huddle on the platform recoiling from the
Claw as it reaches for them

It grabs a woman her screams muted by the thick glass
It draws her up into its sphere and the sphere disappears

Then another Claw comes down and carries away another
victim The aliens arent studying them anymore Theyre
just taking them all somewhere

MATT

looks at the gun in his quavering hands He holds his
shaky breath and inches closer to the alien technicians --
almost within point-blank range

He aims at the back of the middle aliens head but --

The alien on the left turns and looks right at him

Matt stumbles backwards and unloads FOUR ROUNDS into that
terrible face The alien falls back dead but --

The 2nd alien LASHES OUT and sends Matt flying
The 3rd alien trips a switch opening a previously

concealed panel in the wall A SHRILL ALARM goes off and
the alien brings out one of the backpack weapons

It tears off its umbilical -- exposing a section of its
spinal column -- and slaps the backpack onto its shoulders
plugging the weapon directly into its nervous system

Matt rights himself and aims the Glock just as --
The alien turns and FIRES a few rounds at him but --

Matt rolls to the side and BLASTS away at the alien
blowing holes in its chest until the slide locks open

The 3rd alien staggers black blood leaking out of him

Matt and the 2nd alien exchange glances -- both of them
equidistant from the 3rd alien Matt hurls the empty Glock
at the 2nd one and races toward the 3rd tearing the
backpack from its body as it drops dead to the floor

Matt cant plug the weapon into his spine but he repeats
the action he tried in the storage compartment -- forcing
a firing arm forward It FIRES a round at the floor

Matt cocks the arm back and aims at the remaining alien

MATT
Let them out

The Alien Technician just stares at him Its the first
time Matts had a close-up look at one In this foreign
face is a familiar look fear

MATT (CONTD)
Let them out of that room Let
them out Now

Still the alien doesnt respond So Matt points at the
traumatized humans down below

MATT (CONTD)
Let them out Let Them Out

The alien looks down at the humans then back at Matt
Despite the obvious language barrier it seems to
understand what Matt wants it to do

The aliens digits flash across the console until --
DOWN IN THE TORTURE CHAMBER

the three huge ribs that support the platform buckle and

fold up lifting the platform up toward the ceiling And
the hanging trap door from the airplane bay hinges open

The passengers look up at trap door suspicious But a
couple of them climb up through it When it appears safe
the others rapidly follow

MATT
looks at the Alien Technician

MATT (CONTD)
Why are you doing this to us

The alien emits a series of ugly GRUNTS Theres no way
these two will ever communicate with words

Matt tightens his grip on the weapon itching to kill
this thing But something on the console catches his eye

A holographic image of the ship It shows pretty clearly
that the airplane is inside another ship -- a capture

vehicle docked inside the bottom of this mother ship

MATT (CONTD)
Our plane is inside a separate
ship
The alien doesnt comprehend Matt points to the diagram
MATT (CONTD)
Can that part detach Can it take
us back home

Still the alien doesnt understand Matt gives up

A Claw sweeps past the windows and scoops a man off the
platform as he waits to exit

MATT (CONTD)
Hey stop that Put him down --

A tracer round SCREAMS past Matt He dives to the floor

FIVE ALIEN GUARDS stand in the door SHOOTING at him

Matt FIRES a barrage of his own and --

Hits a guard in the face with an EXPLOSIVE round That
one falls back but the others take his place FIRING at --

Matt He takes cover in a shallow nook and SHOOTS at --

Another alien taking him out But the rest stand firm
pinning Matt down with their withering return FIRE So --

Matt looks for an escape route There are no other exits
but just inside the torture chamber a Claw is folding
up into its sphere carrying away another victim

So Matt FIRES round after round at the thick glass The
caustic webs that burst out of each projectile eat into
the pane It crackles and IMPLODES with a soft rush of
air from the slightly pressurized torture room

Matt slings the weapon onto his shoulder leaps onto the
console and leans into --

THE TORTURE CHAMBER

forty feet above the floor With tracer rounds FLITTING
past him he jumps across the chasm to --

Snag the Claw as it folds into the --
TRANSLUCENT SPHERE
which seals up once the entire arm is inside

COPILOT
Help me

The Copilot is the victim ensnared by the folded Claw

Matt tries to climb up to help him but the Claw is closed
tight And the sphere LURCHES into motion

Through the translucent shell Matt and the Copilot watch
as the sphere carries them up into the sewer pipe between
the levels and bulkheads of the ship weird shapes and
vague lights skipping past

And then the sphere rotates 180 degrees upwards throwing
Matt off his feet Suddenly the translucent sphere is
flooded with light as it splits open inside --

INT THE CRYO-BAY -- CONTINUOUS

The Claw awakens and unfolds out of the sphere carrying
the screaming Copilot away from Matt

Matt recovers his weapon and climbs out to see --

The Claw depositing the Copilot into a pod The shackles
SNAP around his limbs and the door starts closing

COPILOT
Help me -- please help me

The Claw retracts into its sphere and disappears
Matt climbs up onto the catwalk and FIRES a shot that --

DESTROYS the control panel of the Copilots pod freezing
the door half-open The shackles release with a SNAP

The Copilot scrambles out of the pod as fast as he can
just in case the door tries to close again

He stands up shaky He absorbs his surroundings and looks
at Matt standing there with an alien weapon

COPILOT (CONTD)
Where did you come from Where
did you get that thing

Matt grabs the Copilot and pulls him along the catwalk

MATT
Come on I have a job for you

COPILOT
Where are we going

MATT
Ever dream of being an astronaut

The Copilot stops short Matt looks back at him

COPILOT
Are wein space

MATT
Low Earth Orbit Yeah

The Copilot blinks at him Matt pulls him along again

MATT (CONTD)
But I found a small ship that might
take us home You have to fly it

COPILOT
(stops again)
You want me to to fly a
spaceship

MATT
You can figure it out Come on
Ill show you
He pulls the Copilot along again toward the airlock
COPILOT
I dont know how to fly a spaceship
Ill get everyone killed

MATT
Not everyones going to be on it

COPILOT
Were not taking the others

Now its Matt who stops He thinks for a moment

MATT
--Shit

Matt turns to the Copilot his confidence suddenly shaken

MATT (CONTD)
Your airplane you think it can
still fly

COPILOT
Not in outer space

MATT
No listen The airplane is inside
a separate ship I think I can
make them send it back down and
release the plane Can it fly

COPILOT
I dont know Maybe How are you
going to make them release it

MATT
(re his alien weapon)
Im going to ask nicely

Matt leads the Copilot back the other way

COPILOT
But if youre not in the
airplane what happens to you
MATT

Youll have to ask NASA to send up
a SWAT team in the space shuttle

The Copilot starts to laugh but realizes it isnt a joke

Matt stops walking again when he sees a hibernating human
in the pod alongside them There are others nearby

COPILOT
Are they dead

Matt hands him the backpack and starts KICKING in the
control panel at the base of a pod He tears the panel
open and is hot wiring it with his wedding ring when --

A round EXPLODES against the catwalk Matt looks up at --
A squad of alien guards FIRING from the next level

Matt pulls the Copilot behind the pod takes the weapon
from him and FIRES back knocking an alien off the catwalk

MATT
(re the control panel)
Use that to open the pod Just
slide the door open

More rounds STRIKE nearby Matt returns suppressing FIRE
so the Copilot can work the controls

COPILOT
Oh damn Whatd I do wrong

The display has changed to a different kind of screen
MATT
What did you push How do we get

back to that first screen

COPILOT
I dont know

Matt tries a few buttons but cant change the screen
This one shows the entire array of cryo-pods

COPILOT (CONTD)
Maybe we can open them all at once

MATT
We do not want to do that

COPILOT
Why not

Matt looks around the vast room at the thousands of pods
imprisoning dormant alien slaves

MATT
Yes Yes we do want to do that

Matt hits buttons at the base of each tower of pods but --

Hundreds of thousands of circuit breakers SNAP and the
entire chamber is plunged into darkness

COPILOT
Uh-oh

A THUNDERCLAP rattles the chamber as hundreds of thousands
of valves OPEN Fluid DRAINS from hundreds of thousands

of pods Hundreds of thousands of doors HISS open

In the dim light from all the control panels Matt and

the Copilot can just barely see all the nearby pods opening
up and soaked airplane passengers tumbling out

Matt hurries over to help a woman get to her feet

Its Marianne

MARIANNE
--Matt
Matt looks at her and just has to laugh He pulls her
wet body into his
MATT
Laneys okay -- shes hidden away --

shes safe
(MORE)

MATT (CONTD)
(to the whole group)
And Im getting everybody off this
ship Lets get back to the airplane --

A SHRILL MONSTROUS SCREAM pierces the darkness high above
them Followed by dozens of others Then hundreds more

COPILOT
What are those things

MATT
Just move your ass ‘cause they
might not greet us as liberators

ON THE CATWALK ABOVE

the alien guards unleash a FIRESTORM the tracer rounds
illuminating them like flares

But theyre not firing down at the humans Theyre shooting

at hulking black shapes that lumber down their catwalk
on all fours rapidly overtaking them

MATT

hops off of their own catwalk and helps Marianne down
into the opening to the sewer pipe

CUT TO

INT MECHANICAL ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Matt drops out of a similar opening in the ceiling of the
space above the airplane and lands on the catwalk

The Copilot Marianne and several other passengers drop
down behind him and follow him along to --

The sphere protruding down through the floor Matt and
the Copilot look down through the opening at --

The tail of the airplane hanging beneath them

MATT
Get everyone back on board and
buckled in
(re the Claw)
This one is caught in the emergency
exit Youll have to untie it and
seal the broken porthole

COPILOT
Got it Now you sure youre okay
with this

MATT

You trying to change my mind

The Copilot takes Matts hand and shakes it vigorously

COPILOT
Were going to remember you

MATT
Not unless you get that plane down
safely Now go

The Copilot starts helping passengers drop down through
the hole and onto the raised tail of the aircraft

But Marianne isnt going anywhere

MARIANNE
What about Laney

MATT
Ill go get her You get down to
the airplane

Matt starts back along the catwalk

MARIANNE
Bullshit

She follows him but he stops and turns to face her

MATT

You got to let me do this on my

own Ill move a lot faster
MARIANNE

Im not getting on that plane

without her
MATT

Then wait for us up here

You can help her climb down

Matt starts for the airlock but Marianne realizes

MARIANNE
--Youre not coming with us

Matt stops Wont everyone just shut up about this

MATT
Somebody has to release the plane

Marianne opens her mouth to protest but knows hes right
Then the ship is rocked by an EXPLOSION somewhere

MARIANNE
What was that

MATT
Guess our new friends are wreaking
havoc Ill be back with Laney

as soon as I can

He runs for the airlock

INT THE NEXT LEVEL -- CONTINUOUS
The outer door HISSES open and Matt peeks out

The darkness of the corridor is alive with sounds Alarms
BLARING Alien voices SCREAMING BATTLES raging

Matt leaps out of the airlock and runs like hell

CUT TO

INT ELEVATOR SHAFT -- MOMENTS LATER

Matt jumps through zero G space and into the ‘up beam
He looks above him to see --

An alien descending toward him It spots Matt and FIRES

Matt goes into contortions to avoid the SALVO but then --

An EXPLOSION erupts far up in the shaft sending debris
raining down at them at high speed

A chunk of something HITS the alien hard sending him
spinning down the shaft

Matt pulls himself out of the light beam and lands on --
THE OBSERVATION LEVEL
as the alien floats down past him writhing in agony

Matt sidles up to the observation room doorway He leans
around the doorframe to see --

A HALF-DOZEN ALIENS

inside The surviving Alien Technician is getting a serious
reaming by an alien who seems to be some sort of SUPERIOR

MATT

continues past undetected He races down the hallway as
another EXPLOSION rocks the ship And then --

His feet come off the deck He flies through the air
weightless -- just like in the elevator shaft

Then the gravity reactivates and Matt SLAMS to the deck
He picks himself up and runs all the way to --

The storage compartment where he left Laney and Agent
Hay He opens the door and leaps inside but --
INT STORAGE COMPARTMENT -- CONTINUOUS

-- Agent Hay tackles Matt to the floor

MATT
Its me Its me

AGENT HAY
Jesus -- sorry You okay

Agent Hay helps Matt to his feet

AGENT HAY (CONTD)
What the hells going on out there

Laney emerges from behind the rack
MATT
Laney Come with me kiddo Theres
somebody who wants to see you
Laney looks up at him afraid to even ask who he means

Matt scoops her off her feet with one arm

MATT (CONTD)
Lets go

CUT TO

INT LOWER DECK CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER

Marianne peers out through the airlock Waiting

Matt comes racing down the corridor with Laney in his
arms and Agent Hay panting hard to keep up They slide to

a stop at the door and Laney sees

LANEY
MOM

Matt sets Laney down and jumps to reach the door controls
But nothing happens

He tries the controls again but still nothing

Marianne yells Whats wrong but is completely inaudible

MATT
Its locked -- were locked out

Marianne tries the controls on her side but has no luck

MATT (CONTD)

They must be sealing off the

bulkheads
Matt waves Laney back and signals Marianne to step aside
He FIRES a few rounds at the outer window fracturing the
thick pane with the caustic webs Matt kicks in the glass
and takes aim at the inner window but --

The weapon just CLICKS

MATT (CONTD)
Oh no

He tries again Nothing Matt checks the backpack magazine

MATT (CONTD)
This things spent

Matt casts it aside and reaches into the airlock He tries
to open the door from inside but still no luck

Matt climbs through the window and starts HAMMERING the
glass of the inner door with his heel But it holds steady

MATT (CONTD)
Dammit

EXPLOSIVE rounds hit the corridor wall Hay turns to see --
Two alien guards loping toward them maybe 100 feet away

AGENT HAY
Matt We got trouble

But a great dark shape emerges from the shadows behind
the guards -- an ESCAPED ALIEN SLAVE galloping on all
fours It tears one of the aliens heads off The remaining
guard turns to FIRE at it but is devoured just as quickly

AGENT HAY (CONTD)
Wait hang on I think were
okay

The escaped slave tosses the corpse aside and spots Agent
Hay and Laney It starts toward them slow and suspicious

AGENT HAY (CONTD)
Scratch that -- we got trouble

Matt keeps kicking at the glass but its pointless

Marianne peers at him from the other side He can just
hear her now when she yells through the remaining window

MARIANNE
What do we do

Matt looks at Laney behind him then back at Marianne

MATT
Go back down to the plane

MARIANNE
No

MATT
Ill get her to you I promise

MARIANNE
How

AGENT HAY
Matt We gotta go

Agent Hay picks up Laney and carries her away from the
approaching alien slave

LANEY
Mom

MARIANNE
Laney

Marianne watches horrified as Laney is carried from view

Matt punches the glass to get Mariannes attention

MATT
You get on that plane Shell be
there -- and she better find you

waiting for her
Before she can respond Matt dives back into the corridor

MARIANNE
NOOO

Matt grabs the backpack weapon and races away leaving
the terrible alien slave in the dust

Matt overtakes Agent Hay plucking Laney from his arms
and carrying her around the bend of the corridor

CUT TO

INT OBSERVATION LEVEL CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER

Matt floats up and out of the elevator shaft with Laney
under his arm He makes a perfect landing on the deck

Agent Hay comes up behind and goes sprawling face-first
Matt sidles up to the observation room doorway and listens

The room is a lot quieter now Laney and Agent Hay join
him Laney points to Matts weapon whispers

LANEY
But that isnt loaded

Matt puts a finger to his lips and gives her a wink

He leans around the doorframe to find --

INT THE OBSERVATION ROOM -- CONTINUOUS
-- the Alien Technician slumped over the console alone
Matt enters quietly weapon raised The alien looks up

MATT
Got another job for you

The alien just looks at him Hard to read the expression
Agent Hay and Laney step into the room and watch

Matt points to the control panel the hologram of the
capture vehicle with the passenger jet inside

MATT (CONTD)
Youre going to release that plane
You understand Youre going to
send it back down

The alien just stares at Matt defiant Matt shoves the
weapon in his face

MATT (CONTD)
Oh yes you are

Laney edges toward the broken window and gasps at --
The Torture Chamber far below full of bodies and blood

MATT (CONTD)
Get her away from there

Agent Hay leads Laney away from the window but shes
already crying The aborted reunion with her mother on
top of everything else is too much for her to bear

Matt turns back to the alien and leans close
MATT (CONTD)
Acknowledge you son of a bitch
You understand what I want -- I
know you do

A shadow darkens the doorway and Agent Hay turns to see --

The Alien Superior entering the room unassuming

AGENT HAY
Matt

Matt spins around and takes aim at the Superior who
freezes in his tracks He appears to be unarmed

But the Alien Technician starts HOWLING wildly

Its so disconcerting that Matt turns back around to cover
the Technician again And his screaming subsides

AGENT HAY (CONTD)
What the hell was that about

LANEY
Its scared

Matt looks at Laney She points at the Technician

LANEY (CONTD)
This one is scared for that one

Matt still doesnt follow

LANEY (CONTD)
Like Mommys scared for me

Matt looks back and forth between the two aliens Could
they be brothers Lovers -- man and woman

MATT
Hay close that door

Agent Hay goes to the doorway and figures out how to trip
the mechanism to seal the room off

Matt approaches the Alien Superior and points the weapon
at his head Then he looks at --

The Technician tensing at the sight of the other in peril

MATT (CONTD)
Now youre gonna send that fucking
plane back home

The Alien Technician does not vacillate He -- or she --
goes to the console Her Superior BARKS at her but she
SNARLS a reply and keeps moving

A new ALARM blares out Another EXPLOSION rocks the ship

MATT (CONTD)
Hang on First things first
(re Laney and Hay)
Youre going to put these two up
there

He points at the raised platform still hanging just below
the trap door leading back to the plane

AGENT HAY
What

MATT
(ignoring Hay)
You can use that thing and carry
them up there

Matt imitates the Claw with this hand miming the action
of carrying someone over to the platform

The Technician looks at him then works some controls

The Superior PROTESTS again but the Technician BARKS
back at him and keeps working

THE CLAW

emerges from its sphere unfolds and stretches toward the
broken window It hangs there an open hand waiting

MATT (CONTD)
Hay take Laney and get back on
the airplane

Agent Hay leads Laney to the broken window and looks out
at the awaiting Claw Kind of hard to trust it by now

LANEY
Matt what about you

MATT
Theres a lifeboat down below
Ill take that

AGENT HAY
You cant fly that thing

Matt silences him with a glare but its too late Laney
catches on as another EXPLOSION jolts the ship

LANEY
Matt whats gonna happen to you

MATT
Dont worry about me Laney Go

LANEY
But why dont you just come with --

AGENT HAY
Somebodys gotta keep these two
covered sweetheart You know
Make sure they send the plane down
safely

Laney looks up at Agent Hay then back at Matt

LANEY
You would do that for us

MATT
Laney hurry up Your moms waiting
for you

She looks at him with tears in her eyes And then runs
over to wrap her arms around him

LANEY
Thank you Matt
AGENT HAY
Oh the big hero To hell with

this
Agent Hay storms over to Matt and grabs the gun
AGENT HAY (CONTD)
Gimme that Take her and get the

fuck out of here

MATT
-- What are you doing

AGENT HAY
(re the Claw)
You can try your luck on that damn
thing Ill stay here
Matt looks at Hay while Hay covers the Alien Superior

MATT
You dont have to do this Hay

AGENT HAY
Yeah I do Go

Matt looks at Hay a moment and claps him on the shoulder

Then Matt scoops up Laney and climbs out the window with
her stepping onto --

THE CLAW

that monstrous thing thats caused them so much misery

It jerks into motion and carries them away from the window
Laney tries not to look down at the 40-foot chasm below
them as Matt leaps off of the Claw and onto --

THE PLATFORM

They run across the raised platform and climb up through
the trap door leading back to their airplane

AGENT HAY

cant help but smile as he watches them go He looks back
at the Technician and keeps the Superior in his sights

AGENT HAY (CONTD)
All right you piece of shit Send
em back home -- and no mistakes

He points to a hologram of Earth his finger hovering
right over North America

AGENT HAY (CONTD)
Put ‘em right here

The Alien Technician seems to sneer at him even as she
starts working the controls again
INT AIRPLANE BAY CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS

Matt and Laney race down the corridor The dimly lit
passenger jet is in view hanging from those tentacles

The whole world SHUDDERS and then an iris starts to close
about to cut them off from their escape

Matt leaps through the narrowing gap and the iris SLAMS
shut behind them sealing up the --

THE AIRPLANE BAY

as Matt and Laney arrive and look up at the plane to see --
Marianne in the open cabin door arguing with Janet and

the Copilot who are trying to stow the deflated evacuation

chute and close the hatch

MATT
Hold the door

Marianne looks out to see Matt and Laney running this
way She nearly leaps out the open door to greet them

MARIANNE
(to the Copilot)
I told you I told you

But Matt and Laney slide to a halt when --

A huge shadow emerges from under the fuselage -- an escaped
ALIEN SLAVE its teeth bared

COPILOT
Whats the matter

MATT
Close the door

The Copilot looks straight down just as the Alien Slave
steps into view and looks up at him

MATT (CONTD)
CLOSE THE DOOR

The Copilot pulls the door shut and latches it just as --
The Alien Slave unleashes an alarming ROAR as it leaps up
to GRIND its machete-like claws against the aluminum hatch
INT FLIGHT 209 FIRST CLASS CABIN -- CONTINUOUS
Marianne struggles with the Copilot
MARIANNE
You cant leave her out there
INT AIRPLANE BAY -- CONTINUOUS
The beast gives up on the plane and turns to see --

Matt and Laney running away The problem is where do
they go Theres no escaping from the airplane bay now

The Alien Slave starts after them its claws slipping on
the greasy floor at first but gradually taking hold

Matt and Laney stop near the back wall out of options

Then another JOLT rattles the ship and gravity quits on
them Matt and Laney drift up off the floor

The Alien Slave floats up too but its forward momentum
carries it straight toward them

Matt pushes off of Laney and they separate letting --

The beast fly right in between and SLAM into the wall

INT OBSERVATION ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Agent Hay holds the gun steady on the Alien Superior as --
The console hologram shows the squat cylindrical capture
vehicle launching out of the bottom of the mother ship
EXT LOW EARTH ORBIT -- CONTINUOUS

As the real capture vehicle separates from the mother

ship thrusters silently fire to shed its orbital velocity
INT AIRPLANE BAY -- CONTINUOUS

And Matt Laney and the rampaging Alien Slave SLAM back
down to the deck deceleration now providing their gravity

The huge Alien Slave hits extra hard and that gives Matt
and Laney a head start

Matt grabs Laney and crams her into the deep crevice
between two ribs in the wall He squeezes in there with
her just as --
The Alien Slave SLAMS into the ribs It SNARLS and tries
to bite at them but cant get close enough
INT FIRST CLASS CABIN -- CONTINUOUS

The passengers recover from their own weightless adventure

Marianne scrambles over to the port-side windows but
cant see anything out there in the darkness

MARIANNE

Open that door
INT AIRPLANE BAY -- CONTINUOUS
Matt stands between Laney and the Alien Slave as it SNARLS
and ROARS at them and reaches into the crevice taking
swipes at them Matts got to lean backwards to keep from
getting his face torn off
INT MOTHER SHIP OBSERVATION ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Something SLAMS into the locked observation room door --
alien guards no doubt trying to force their way in

Agent Hay just keeps covering the aliens and watches --

The capture vehicle rapidly descending toward Earth

EXT LOW EARTH ORBIT -- CONTINUOUS

The real capture vehicle hits the atmosphere A cocoon of
glowing plasma envelopes the ship

INT AIRPLANE BAY -- CONTINUOUS

Inside the ship RATTLES and GROANS like its skating
across concrete Matt and Laney cower inside their little
nook as the Alien Slave grows more and more furious
Realizing it cant reach them it attacks the ribs of the
wall THRASHING them with its immense claws PEELING back
the metal in jagged layers trying to widen the opening

Then the gravitational effect doubles causing the Alien
Slave to lose its footing Behind it --

The airplane swings in the tentacles like a pendulum

The gravitational effect triples and the nose of the
airplane CRASHES to the floor SCRAPING metal-on-metal as
it sways back and forth

Matts own feet slip out from under him and his feet end
up sticking out past the ribs

The Alien Slave drags itself forward against the G forces
and SNAPS its jaws at Matts legs but --

He draws them back inside just in time

LANEY
What do we do

MATT
I dont know

The Alien Slave reaches inside tries to claw Matt He
kicks at it but it SLASHES his leg He screams and backs
up a little more squeezing Laney even further

Again the beast tries to jam itself into the crevice
thick ropes of saliva spilling from its huge jaws

INT FIRST CLASS CABIN -- CONTINUOUS

The Copilot fights against the G forces to open the door

again Marianne leans out to search the darkness but she
cant see Matt or Laney She cant even hear the roar of

the Alien Slave over the SHUDDERING of the ship

She tries to jump out of the plane but Janet and the
Copilot hold her back

MARIANNE
Let me out there LET ME OUT THERE

Then the gravitational effect quadruples and everyone
falls to the deck
INT AIRPLANE BAY -- CONTINUOUS

The Alien Slave cant bear its own weight anymore Its
legs splay out and it SLAMS to the slippery floor

Matt struggles to hold up himself up so he doesnt crush
Laney behind him He looks past the beast to see --

The web of tentacles SLIPPING The airplane drops nearly
crashing all the way down -- lying almost flat now

Some of the tentacles loosen up so they can get a better
grip on the fuselage They move slow like slugs bunching
up then thinning out as they stretch

INT FIRST CLASS CABIN -- CONTINUOUS

The SHUDDERING starts to subside and the deceleration
eases a bit allowing Marianne to crawl back to the door

MARIANNE
Laney Laney
INT AIRPLANE BAY -- CONTINUOUS
The hulking Alien Slave struggles to regain its footing
But Matt keeps his eye on the tentacles

MATT
Stay here

LANEY
Where are you going

He doesnt answer Hes already up and moving -- out from
between the ribs past the SNAPPING jaws of the Alien
Slave straight for --

The airplane running under the length of the fuselage

It takes a moment for the Alien Slave to start following
but once its moving it rapidly gains on --

Matt who leaps through a shifting loop of tentacle

The Alien Slave follows but is too big It gets caught
and the tentacle draws tight against the fuselage

Matt looks back and watches as --

The Alien Slave wrestles to free itself from the tentacle
But even that monstrosity is no match for something strong
enough to pull a jetliner out of the sky

MATT
Now Laney Come on

Laney springs from her hiding spot She runs past the
entangled beast and straight for Matt but --

The floor SPLITS open right in front of her blinding
daylight and deafening WIND pouring up through the opening

Laney tries to stop but slips on the slick floor and
falls right into the widening gap

MATT (CONTD)
LANEY

She catches the very edge and is left dangling over --

Empty sky the ground at least a mile below her Theyre
so high clouds are flitting past

The entire floor of the capture vehicle is one huge iris
its four blades rotating slowly open

Matt is caught on one blade and Laney on another And the
gap between them is only getting wider

INT FIRST CLASS CABIN -- CONTINUOUS

Marianne watches all this from the open cabin door

MARIANNE
LANEY

Her voice is all but lost in the HURRICANE-FORCE WINDS

INT AIRPLANE BAY -- CONTINUOUS

Matt runs toward Laney pumping his arms and leaning into
it He plants a foot and leaps over the gap and --

Just barely makes it across He rolls onto the disgusting
floor then scrambles back to the edge

INT FLIGHT 209 FIRST CLASS CABIN -- CONTINUOUS
The Copilot looks down at the earth rushing towards them

CAPTAIN
Theyre going to let us go We
have to close this hatch and prepare
for flight

MARIANNE
No My little girl is out there
INT AIRPLANE BAY -- CONTINUOUS

Matt reaches over the edge and grabs a firm hold of Laneys
little arm She looks up at him frozen in terror

Hes got her but his hands are slick from the gunk all
over the floor Shes slowly slipping from his grip

And his own grip on the slick floor is tenuous at best
He hasnt got the leverage to pull her up All he can do
is hold her in place and pray she doesnt pull him over

And the Alien Beast hasnt given up on them yet It
wriggles out of the tentacle and lunges at Matt but its
back feet are still caught the tentacle tightening up

The beast SNAPS at Matt just a few feet away

INT FLIGHT 209 FIRST CLASS CABIN -- CONTINUOUS

The Copilot must forcibly remove Marianne kicking and
screaming from the doorway so Janet can close the hatch

MARIANNE
LANEY

INT AIRPLANE BAY -- CONTINUOUS

As the floor continues to open up the airplane bay fills
with swirling dust and vapor from the THUNDERING thrusters
of the capture vehicle

Visibility drops The noise and the wind is unbearable

The Alien Slave digs its claws into the metal floor and
pulls closer to Matt Its only inches away when --

The moving quadrant of floor finally slides out from under
it and the Alien Slave swings out over the void dangling
from the tentacle

But now Matt becomes aware of a new threat This section
of floor is carrying them closer and closer to the ribbed

wall of the airplane bay If it doesnt stop soon the
floor will disappear under the wall and theyll plummet

INT FLIGHT 209 COCKPIT -- CONTINUOUS

The Copilot staggers into his seat and pulls on his headset
to discover that communications have come back online

VOICE ON HEADSET (VO)
--dont know who you are or if
you understand English but you
have entered US airspace and if
you dont turn your ass around
right now we will light it up

COPILOT
No no Hold your fire There are
people inside

VOICE ON HEADSET (VO)
Who is this Identify yourself

COPILOT
This is NorAm Air flight 209 Im
activating my transponder

EXT CAPTURE VEHICLE -- CONTINUOUS

As the alien craft descends through the sky two FA-22
Raptors close in on it from behind
VOICE ON HEADSET (VO)
NorAm 209 Wed written you off
What did they do to you

COPILOT
Its a long story but -- whoa
INT AIRPLANE BAY -- CONTINUOUS

The tentacles start to loosen and the plane jerks downward

The Alien Slave clings to its tentacle for dear life
even as the tentacle lets go of Flight 209

And Matt is quickly running out of floor space

And hes losing his grip on Laney

INT FLIGHT 209 COCKPIT -- CONTINUOUS

The pilot clutches his yoke squinting at the cloud of
vapor that obscures his view yelling into his headset

COPILOT
Brace for --

IMPACT

EXT DESERT -- CONTINUOUS (DAY)

Flight 209 CRASHES to earth from a height of about ten
feet As the dust storm subsides

The plane is sitting on a flat patch of Nevada desert
cactus and scrub crushed underneath the battered hull

The capture vehicle continues on tentacles dragging along
the desert sand a wake of dust and vapor trailing behind

The tentacles retract The iris blades close up again
And the alien spacecraft rockets back into the sky

As the jet engines WIND DOWN silence returns to the
desert There is no one around to appreciate the sight of --

A passenger jet lying crippled on the desert floor --
flat on its belly because its gear are still retracted
Its battered and scraped and gushing hydraulic fluid
A wing flap comes unhinged and CRASHES to the ground

The cabin door slowly CREAKS open and Janet peers out
squinting in the harsh daylight

CUT TO
INT MOTHER SHIP OBSERVATION ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Agent Hay watches closely as --

The hologram shows the capture vehicle soaring away from
the airplane safe on the ground even as the guards
outside the observation room BATTER DOWN the door

Hay barely has time to smile to himself before --

The door EXPLODES inward and a dozen alien guards pour
into the room and OPEN FIRE on Agent Hay

He is blown back against the wall and slides to the floor
He has just enough energy to raise his weapon and -- CLICK --
reveal that it was empty the whole time

The Alien Technician and the Alien Superior exchange
furious glances

Agent Hay chuckles at their anger and then his face goes
slack Dead

DISSOLVE TO

EXT DESERT -- CONTINUOUS

The Copilot stands beside the plane signaling to the two
Raptors SCREAMING in a low circle over the crash site

Passengers file out of the emergency exits and climb down
off the wings You can tell which ones stayed with the
plane and which ones were studied by how dirty they are

That really filthy one up there is Marianne She stands
on the wing searching the crowd below and the surrounding
desert A distant THRUMMING catches her ear

Marianne shades her eyes and looks off in the distance
far ahead of the plane to see --

A plume of dust rising up -- a convoy of military vehicles
and helicopters racing this way But much closer --

A figure looms into view -- a man limping over a rise A
man carrying a listless little girl

Marianne jumps down from the wing and races through the
scrub brush heedless of the jagged cactus all around

MATT

staggers across the rough ground filthy dusty bloody
But he can still manage a smile

Laney lifts her weary head off Matts shoulder and turns
to see her mother running this way

LANEY
Mommy

Lets leave them alone now Lets pull away as Marianne
runs to meet Matt and Laney

Lets rise up into the air and get a better look at that
battered jetliner dropped in the middle of nowhere as --

Apache gunships THUNDER past us Humvees and medical crews
RUSH beneath racing toward the scene to hear a most
terrible story -- and a chilling warning of what may come

Finally lets look up at the F-22s circling high above
then peeling off leaving nothing but blue sky behind

Beautiful blue sky endless and unknowable
CUT TO BLACK

THE END
