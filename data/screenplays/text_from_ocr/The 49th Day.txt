their desks

Teresas got curly red hair freckles and glasses Shes
the girl in the painting over Diana’s bed

The pieces are geometric shapes -- squares rectangles
triangles and parallelograms of various sizes and colors

The object of the exercise is to place the pieces into a
square They need to be manipulated into place turned over
flipped around fitted every which way to make it happen

Diana whips her pieces into place in a few moments

MRS LEACH
Very good Again

Diana mixes them up starts over

Teresa and Matt fiddle with their pieces trying this then
that getting nowhere They aren’t close to being able to
accomplish the task at hand

Diana finishes up again

Diana jumbles her pieces up Starts over

TERESA
(frustrated)
The last three never fit right
Mrs Leach

MATT

MRS LEACH
It’s OK Keep trying

Try as they might Teresa and Matt can’t make it happen
Diana finishes her third time

DIANA
Can I go now

MRS LEACH
Very good Thank you Yes you
may all go back to your reading

She pulls Tomoko aside

MRS LEACH
As you know your daughter’s mind
is simply astounding Her test
scores are off the charts and her
artwork shows a level of depth and
complexity that’s way beyond her
years But since her brother and
grandmother passed away she’s been
having problems in class and I
wanted to chat with you about it

TOMOKO
Problems

MRS LEACH
Yes This imaginary friend

TOMOKO
Shyla

MRS LEACH
Yes She’s been spending more and
more time interacting with Shyla
rather than playing with her
friends or doing her class work --
retreating into her own world and
shutting others out

Diana points to the window speaks to thin air

DIANA
Caught you Were you trying to
sneak up on me again

MRS LEACH
(whispering to Tomoko)
The change in her personality has
been dramatic Have you spoken to
her doctor

EXT DIANA’S SCHOOL - DAY
Tomoko and Diana stroll down the sidewalk

A wretched wild-eyed HOMELESS WOMAN (50s) pushing a shopping
cart calls out

HOMELESS WOMAN

business following that little
girl

Tomoko spins around There’s no one behind them

HOMELSS WOMAN

me

Tomoko takes Diana’s hand and they hurry on

INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

DR SUSAN MAZMANIAN (30s) Diana’s genial pediatrician sits
at her cluttered desk conferring with Tomoko and Nathan

DR MAZMANTAN
Considering all she’s been through
it’s natural she might want to
spend some time alone to try to
find her bearings

TOMOKO
But she’s never locked the door on
me like that before

NATHAN
She also claims to see visions of
her brother and grandmother at the
temple

DR MAZMANTAN
I wouldn’t be overly concerned
about that Children her age have
extremely active imaginations and
when you add the trauma she’s
experienced from the recent deaths
it’s like throwing gas on a fire

NATHAN
But she seems to believe that
they’re actually there -- as if
she’s having hallucinations or
something

TOMOKO
No Nate she’s just pretending to
see loved ones -- and that comforts
her Drop it OK

NATHAN
(bristling)
Drop it

DR MAZMANTAN
What we really need to address here
is the sleepwalking Has she ever
done that before

Tomoko shakes her head

DR MAZMANTAN
It could be nothing at all but
let’s keep an eye on this OK
When a child suddenly starts
sleepwalking it can often be
indicative of problems buried deep
in the subconscious If this type
of behavior continues you should
consult a specialist

INT DIANA’S BEDROOM - DAY

Diana closes her door locks it Shyla’s face shimmers in
the mirror

plastic storage bins and pulls out the wooden box with her
father’s revolver

She opens the box holds the pistol in her hands

SHYLA
You know how to put the bullets in

DIANA

Diana pops the cylinder open takes a cartridge from the box
inserts it into a chamber then SNAPS it shut

Diana points the gun at her reflection in the mirror

Your great-grandmother grew up in
a tiny fishing village on an island
off the coast of Japan She’s
nearly a hundred years old
Stories were part of their lives
and culture way back then They
made up folk tales about the sun
and moon about why the seas were
calm or angry They made up
stories about everything including
why people die -- but that doesn’t
make them true

Diana won’t meet his eyes She admires her flowers

DIANA
These are for the table

Exasperated Nathan hefts the bag of bark and stalks away

him on the shoulder He thinks the

She stops short her eyes shining with wonder and pain

end He bows steps forward

in the SUV’s window

Diana lets out a scream The SUV tears off down the street
the police car right behind

of fun

it off the table it falls and SHATTERS on the floor

shoved Grandma down the steps

NATHAN
No Nobu slipped and struck his
head on the diving board and
Grandma tumbled down the stairs
Shyla had nothing to do with it

DIANA
Then she got jealous of Teresa and
killed her too

imagination running away with you

shreds of tape

to the shrink at school

NATHAN
Our daughter is drifting farther
and farther away -- and I’m not

just going to stand around and
watch it happen

TOMOKO
There’s no need to yell

He slices his finger cries out in pain

INT MEDICAL OFFICE - DAY

DR JENNY (50s) Rick’s soft-spoken wife sits beside Diana
on the couch She offers a smile

DR JENNY
I just want to chat with you a for
a few minutes if that’s OK But
you don’t have to say a single word
until you’re ready All right
sweetheart

Diana nods

DR JENNY
I was wondering why you decided to
cut your hair

Diana turns away tight-lipped

DR JENNY
All right then maybe we can talk
about why Shyla’s the only one you
play with Is she more fun than
your other friends

Diana stares at the wall
DR JENNY
Here’s one for you What came

first the chicken or the egg

DIANA
That’s easy The egg

DR JENNY
Really Why

DIANA

Because dinosaurs were here before
chickens and dinosaurs laid eggs
I figured that one out back in
kindergarten

Dr Jenny takes a moment nods
DR JENNY
Good Very good I’ve been doing
this for a long time but that’s a
new one on me High five

She puts up her hand to slap but Diana turns away

DR JENNY

chocolate

concerned Please tell me about
Shyla
(looking around)
Is she here with us now

WAITING ROOM

Diana sits alone in a chair in the corner presses the heels
of her hands to her eyes

DIANA
Leave me alone

MEDICAL OFFICE
Dr Jenny confers with Nathan and Tomoko

DR JENNY
I couldn’t reach her That’s not
unusual for a first visit but let
me make a few observations if I
may Tearing a butterfly apart
and burning it -- that’s very
distressing behavior So is the
fact that she cut off all her hair
And as for the large bandage on her
wrist do you know how she hurt
herself

TOMOKO
She wouldn’t tell me

DR JENNY
I assume youve heard of cutting
It’s a self-harming behavior
Children hurt themselves physically
as a way to ease emotional pain
Often they cut themselves on the
wrist

TOMOKO
She’d never do that

NATHAN
Please Tomoko

DR JENNY
You also mentioned you found her
sleepwalking shining a flashlight
up and down the road during a
thunderstorm She was almost
killed that night

TOMOKO
No That was just a nightmare --

NATHAN
Let her speak

DR JENNY
Thank you Then there’s the matter
of her fall from the tree house
Did she sustain a concussion when
she banged her head We should
schedule an MRI to rule out any
possibility of damage to the soft
tissue And finally if she were
my child Id have her start
therapy immediately and consider
putting her on medication -- just
to even her out a bit

INT GARAGE - DAY

Nathan takes a few half-hearted stabs at his punching bag
Shoves it away
