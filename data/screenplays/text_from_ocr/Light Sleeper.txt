NIGHT IN THE LIFE

curbside door motions to the DRIVER hell be back in

minutes He enters the video laundromat a twenty-four-

Inside he meets a RETRO-YUPPIE (J Crew Division) in
Classics section They exit

On the sidewalk money is exchanged for a packet
pockets the uncounted cash The YUPPIE mouths goodbye

to put distance between him and LETOUR JOHN checks his
beeper stops at a pay phone dials

JOHN LETOUR re-enters the sedan the DRIVER heads

LETOUR nods as EDDIE employing diminished skills
counts
from a roll of twenties JOHN looks around full
ashtrays

porn tapes empty vodka bottles -- there have been no

friends

LETOUR
Eddie Look at yourself Sit down

years
EDDIE

One more thing I gotta use the phone
EDDIE pockets the envelope as JOHN checking his
beeper
walks to the phone
Later LETOUR sits in an Upper West Side apartment as
an
earnest MID-TWENTIESH MAN wearing undershorts snorts
a
hefty line offers a rolled dollar bill as he talks
LETOUR

declines

MID-TWENTIESH MAN
(continuing)
but -- if theres no God how can
man conceive of him The idea of God
presupposes the existence of God
Thats the Ontological Argument
Anselm Twelve hundred Fourteen
hundred -- Im not sure --

LETOUR
(checks his watch)
Ive got to go

MID-TWENTIESH MAN

(gesturing)
Let me finish Okay if the idea of
God is implanted by God -- the sensus

divinitatus the sense of the divine --
what is the role of human thought
Not faith thought

LETOURs mind drifts His diary voice overlaps

LETOUR

(Voice over)
Everybody wants to talk Its like a
compulsion My philosophy is you
got nothing to say dont say it
They figure you can tell a DD
anything things they would never
tell anyone else He understands Of
course theyre stoned to start If I
could tie together all the hours of
coke talk Ive heard that would be
a lot of string It was Roberts
idea to add twenty-five dollars to
home deliveries cause its such a
hassle Fifty is more like it

Later Narration continues as sedan drives through

rain

Later A Tribeca loft LETOUR swaps drug jargon with
TWO
