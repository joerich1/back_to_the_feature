Saviors of God
EXT NAZARETH - DAY

Seen from above JESUS the son of Mary 28 years-old
Tiés on a scrubby hillock under an olive tree

The mid-morning sun shines on his clean-shaven face He
is dreaming

JESUS (V0)
The pain starts just above the neck
It feels as if an old man has snuck
up and grabbed me from behind His
fingers slip underneath the skin and
work claw their way up the back of
my neck Then the real pain begins
Each finger digs into the soft matter
behind my brain and then strain
across the top of my head toward my
eyes Just before they reach the
eyes they dig down

Jesus wakens He looks around holding his head

JESUS (V0)
(continuing)
I remembered I had to make a cross

CUT TO
INT CARPENTERS WORKSHOP - DAY
Jesus shapes a long piece of timber with an adze

His patched tunic rests on the workbench The white
plaster-and-brick walls are hung with the tools of Jesus’
trade saws hammers rasps and measuring squares Two
small windows let in light and breeze from the village

His face is etched by lines caused by thinking too much
Brain fever

A nail-studded belt hangs from a hook above his head
The belt is speckled with dried blood

JESUS (V0)
4 first I fasted for three months
Then I whipped myself before sleeping
At first it worked then the headaches
returned

Jesus wipes wood shavings from his sweaty chest He

hears a NOISE from outside Frightened he looks toward
the door

JESUS (V0)
(continuing)
Who is it Who are you Why are
you following me

JUDAS 30 blacksmith bursts into the room The door
RATTLES on its wood hinges Jesus goes back to work

Judas’ face is ablaze with wild red hair beard and
moustache His bulging forearms are dirtied by grease
burnt by fire He belongs to the Sicarri (assassins)
the terrorist wing ofthe Zealots a radical Jewish po-
litical organization His presence is frightening

JUDAS
I thought Id find you here Arent
you ashamed The carpenters from
Cana and Capernaum refuse to make
a cross for a Zealot but you get
up and throw yourself into it like
a madman Wheres your pride

Jesus silent backs away

JUDAS
(continuing)
What if the Messiah were to come
now and find you doing this

Jesus returns to his adze He says quietly

JESUS
Leave me alone Judas I mist work
JUDAS
Arent you ashamed
JESUS
(softly)
No
JUDAS

Youve seen them hanging there for

days skin falling off their bodies
Crying night after night Our prophets
Because of the Romans and men like you

A migrain moves across Jesus face He winces

JESUS
No I dont have any pride I dont
go to Synagogue I disobey the
commandments I work on the
Sabbath

JUDAS
And who will pay for your sins

JESUS
I dont know Im struggling

Judas disgusted calls to the crowd outside

JUDAS
Come here Look at the traitor
Look at the cross-maker

The crowd jeers Jesus resumes his task
CUT TO
EXT CARPENTERS WORKSHOP - DAY (LATER)

A CENTURION pushes his way through the crowds gathered
outside the white-washed buildings He is sickened by
the foul-smelling Jewry

Jesus stands outside his workshop hewing a cyprus cross
A semi-circle of spiteful Israelites surrounds hin
The Centurion approaches

CENTURION
You ready
(as Jesus nods)
Comon

Jesus takes the nail-studded belt from its hook and
buckles it around his waist The Centurion helps Jesus
heft the cross-beam to his shoulders The Centurion
leads Jesus through a gaumtlet the crowd has formes
from the village to a rocky hill outside Nazareth
Ahead six Roman soldiers lead the protesting ZEALOT
Two mounted soldiers flank the group

The Zealot crazed by fear possessed by God calls out
to anyone who will listen

ZEALOT
Stand up Israelites WNows the
time of Judgement Yahweh is counting
everyone Stand be counted

The Zealots hands are tied behind him His clothes are
torn and bloody his long hair and grey beard matted with
blood and sweat

Judas insinuates his way into a group of townspeople
Fearful of the Romans he speaks under his breath

JUDAS
How long are we going take this
Can we let the Romans kill anyone
who opens his mouth When are we
going be men When will we be Jews

No one pays attention to Judas Seeing this he with-
draws

The villagers heap abuse on Jesus PETER and JAMES are
in the crowd

MARY 56 mother of Jesus pushes her way through the
crowd She stands in front of Jesus trying to hold back
the crowd with her arms She calls out

MARY (MOTHER OF JESUS)
Forgive my son Hes crazy He
doesnt know what hes doing He
has problems Ever since he was a
baby Hes not well in the head

The crowd hoots her into silence Jesus turing his eyes
from her trudges forward The CENTURION follows close
ehind

As they near the crucifixion site another woman MARY
MAGDALENE 25 approaches Jesus She wears brightly
colored clothes her lips and cheeks are painted like a
prostitute The villagers revile her as she passes

She walks alongside Jesus staring him in the face The
color flows from Jesus face his resolve nearly melts
with it

JESUS
Magdalene Who told you to ccne

MAGDALENE
You thought you could forget re
You never will
Jesus mind goes back to a day the previous year

EXT NAZARETH - CRUCIFIXION SITE - DAY
Magdalene spits in Jesus face

MAGDALENE
Cross-maker

Jesus lowers his face
The Zealots voice rings out

ZEALOT
Children have faith in the God of
Israel Dont be afraid Rome is
in smoke Remember the Maccabees
remember how they threw out the
Greeks In the same way well
throw out the Romans There is only
one God of Hosts

The Zealot has reached the crucifixion site a rocky
flint covered mound The soldiers wait for the cross

Children throw pebbles at Jesus as he approaches the
Zealot The Roman guards brace themselves for violence

Jesus sets the cross down beside the Zealot The guards
wrestle the Zealot to the ground

Mary unable to contain herself bursts through the
crowd

MARY (MOTHER OF JESUS)
Jesus My son Get away from here

The guards move toward her Peter and ANOTHER MAN help
the women take her away before the Romans can arrest her
Judas sickened by this spectacle walks away

The guards place the Zealot on the cross and tie his arms
Jesus moving the weges readies the hole for the cross

The Magdalene throws herself at the Zealots feet

MAGDALENE
Be brave

One of the calvarymen drives her back with his horse
There will be no revolt today

The guards prepare to drive the nails into the Zealots
hands A hush comes over the crowd

The spike is placed in the Zealots palm The hammer
raised

Metal hits metal the spike pierces the upraised hand
The Zealots scream (almost ecstatic) is echoed by the crowd

Blood spatters a drop falls on Jesus lips

CUT TO
EXT OUTSKIRTS OF NAZARETH - DAWN

Jesus without staff or sandals walks quickly across a
grassy plain northeast of Nazareth Although much of the
lake district of Galilee is rocky and barren today it
was not so in Jesus time Then it was a fertile and
pleasant valley the treasure of the Mid-East It was
later de-nuded by the Turks Behind Jesus Nazareth stirs
to life

Jesus leans his body into the wind as he reaches the crest
of a low ridge

JESUS (V0)
If I take the goats path south to
bypass Magdala and Tiberias Traders
from East and West go out of gheir
way to drink and whore and

Jesus watches a small caravan headed down the hills toward
the sea He shakes these thoughts from his mind

JESUS (V0)
(continuing)
This is the happiest moment of my life
Ive always felt something was after me
I must be as stupid as everyone says
God only wanted me to join him in the
desert He waits in a well at the Monastery

Jesus skips for joy as he walks

JESUS (V0)
Why would he want somone as stunid as
me Thank you

He sings a psalm as he goes

JESUS
“The Lord reigns let the earth be glad
let the distant shores rejoice
Rise up O Judge of earth
pay back the proud what they deserve
How long will the wicked O Lord how
long will the wicked be jubilant

CUT TO
EXT SEA OF GENNESARET - MORNING

Jesus walks a hundred yards off the coast of the Sea of
Gennesaret (today called Galilee) In the water a group

of men pull in their nets after a morning of fishing They
ore ZEBEDEE James and John PHILIP a shepherd stands with
them

By American standards the Sea of Gennesaret is quite small
13 miles long and 8 miles wide From any point the oppo-
site shore is visible

To this day its sweet clear water is naturally stocked
with fish Because its located in a pocket in the hills
Gennesaret remains subject to sudden violent storms

On shore Judas talks with Peter

Zebedee fiftiesh is the father of James and John Peter
spots Jesus and calls out

PETER
Look whos here Hey Cross-maker

Jesus glances at them and keeps walking

PHILIP
(calling out)
You better keep walking Dont
stop here

ZEBEDEE
Dont bother him Were all part
of the same plan The fish says
God dont let me get caught’
The fisherman says ‘God give me
fish Back to work

(to Judas)

Hey Red You mind your own
business too

Philip walks over to Peter and Judas and says to Zebedee

PHILIP
Be careful Zebedee Hes from the
Idumea Lions still live out there
Dont pick a fight with him
(to Judas)
Whats happening in the plain

JUDAS
Everythings fine Philip The Lords
merciful In Nazareth He crucifies
prophets Here He sends enough rain
to ruin a years crops in one night
In Jerusalem the Romans squat in
the temple

ZEBEDEE
Shut up Whatever God does is
right

JUDAS

It is for you You hire fifty fishermen
like slaves and pay them minimum Then
you give to the temple and get Gods
blessing

ZEBEDEE
Hey you got the mark of Cain on
you Now get out

Judas walks off calling back to Zebedee

JUDAS
I wouldnt want to be in your boat
when the Messiah comes

Philip catches up with him

PHILIP
Wait I want to talk to you

JUDAS
Why now Were you afraid a few
minutes ago The King of the Jews
is on his way Decide what side
you are on

PHILIP
Help me I am afraid But I
cant stand It anymore

JUDAS
(moves close to him)
Philip can you kill

PHILIP
A man
JUDAS
What do you think Sheep
PHILIP
I killed a bull once but never a man
JUDAS
A mans easier
PHILIP
(hushed)
Are you one of them -- the Zealots
JUDAS

Dont be afraid Were fighting for
freedom The day will come when you
can join us Do you have a knife
PHILIP
Yes
SUDAS
Carry it all the time These are
hard times

Judas opens his shirt revealing a double-edged dagger

JUDAS
(continuing)
Yesterday the brotherhood condemned
the traitor The lot fell to me

PHILIP
The cross-maker

JUDAS
(nods)
Keep your mouth shut Think about
what Ive said The day will come
when we will need you

PHILIP
How will I know

Judas turns to leave
JUDAS

Dont be in a hurry Youre not
one of the brothers yet

We keep a loaf for travelers We

CUT TO
EXT MONASTERY - DAY

Jesus walks hurriedly toward a walled desert commune The
landscape is now barren and wild In the distance sheer
cliffs ascend from a sandy plain

In Christian times these communes were called monasteries

but these pre-Christian qutposts lacked the doctrinal simplicity

and ascetic commitment of the later Catholic monasteries
They were simply groups of religious men living together to
meditate do good works and preserve the Torah and other
religious documents

Jesus knocks on the main door He waits anxiously as the
ABBOT opens the door

JESUS
Thank God I thought Id never
make it Please let me in Im

Jesus sleeps on a woven mat
He hears a HISSING SOUND His eyes open he sits up
A snake emerges from a hole in the wall and slithers across
the earthen floor’ Another snake follows it The snakes
coil around each other and copulate
Jesus sits up his back to the wall watching
JESUS (V0)

Why now after all this time So

this is sex Men and women coupling

This is why they were thrown out of

Paradise

(watches the snakes)

But everything is of God And

everything has two megnings one

obvious one hidden What are

they telling me

He looks at one of the snakes It speaks to him in Mary
Magdalenes voice

SNAKEMAGDALENE
Jesus I forgive you

The snakes change color as they coil -Is this real -- or a
vision The question doesnt occur to Jesus Nor would it
to his contemporaries They lived in a time which accepted
healings miracles stigmata and visions as extensions of
the natural world

Jesus grabs his chest the snakes hiss inside his breast

JESUS (V0)
Leave me alone

Jesus breathes a sigh of relief The Abbot stands in the
door Jesus looks up The snakes are gone

ABBOT
Whats wrong

Jesus doesnt answer The Abbot puts his fingers to Jesus
lips

JESUS
Theyre gone

ABBOT
Yes theyve fled

The buildings are constructed of wood and black basalt rock

ZEBEDEE

(points to camel)
Can you believe this Its bad
enough we live in a whorehouse
but she a Jew works on Sabbath
While our women cant even look in
a mirror she makes ‘love with
Romans

Zebedees voice is raised A crowd starts to gather TABAS
a Zealot and trouble-maker joins with two companions

TABAS
Yeah we come back from synagogue and
and look the other way

A WOMAN stands across the narrow street

WOMAN OF MAGDALA
You ought to see the things I see
Im too poor to move so I have to
put up with it

ZEBEDEE

TABAS
The whore should move

growing crowds egg them on

CUT TO
EXT MAGDALA - DAY

Jesus and Judas enter the village The streets are quiet
It is Sabbath Ahead they hear a commotion

JESUS
What is it

JUDAS
Lets find out

They hurry through the streets until they come to a clearing
A mob has assembled around a shallow pit

Judas the man of action pushes his way through the crowd
Jesus follows

Mary Magdalene lies in the pit her knees and elbows are
bloody from being dragged down the street Terrified

The crowd in a festive mood hurl insults and spit at her
Children collect rocks for a stoning

JESUS
(to Judas urgent)
Its Magdalene

Jesus steps into the center of the pit stands next to
Magdalene and holds up his hands

JESUS
Stop

First theres a stunned silence then a buzz runs through
the crowd No one is more surprised than Judas He watches
closely

In the crowd Philip and Peter have joined Andrew and John
Tabas calls out

TABAS
Get out of the way She violated
the Sabbath She must pay the
price

A small anonymous stone hits Magdalenes hip She grabs
Jesus leg

MAGDALENE
Help

ZEBEDEE
(chants)
Death Death Death

Jesus walks in a circle around Magdalene He stares her
accusors in the eye

JESUS
Listen to me Look me in the face
Which of you has not stolen lied
murdered Let the one without sin
throw the first stone

The crowd is frozen Zebedee picks up a large rock

ZEBEDEE
Im not afraid Im innocent

JESUS

(steps up to him)
Dont make a mistake Zebedee
There is a God Dont tell me
youve never cheated an employee
snuck into a widows bedroom at
night Arent you afraid God will
paralyze you if you lift that stone
That your hand will wither and hang
at your side

The old man is suddenly filled with fear and superstition
Zebedee drops the rock and runs The sympathies of the mob
shift to Jesus

Judas is heartened Perhaps this is the leader to unite
the people

Tabas and his companions start toward Jesus but Judas steps
between them braced for action The crowd afraid of Judas
backs away

Jesus helps Mary to her feet Judas calls to the crowd

12

JUDAS
Come follow the rabbi“ He will

speak

Judas Jesus and Magdalene walk away from the pit toward the
outskirts of town A large segment of the crowd follows
One VILLAGER whispers to another

VILLAGER

EXT HILLSIDE IN MAGDALA - DAY

Jesus and Judas lead the curious crowd up a steep green
hillside In the distance the sun is low over Mt Hebron

Magdalene sits near Jesus feet Judas stands in the back-
ground The crowd waits to hear what Jesus has to say
Jesus looks out over the razamuffin villagers the peaceful
countryside

JESUS (V0)
This is the moment Ive always
feared There is so much to say
God has so many miracles

A pause The words burst out

JESUS
Brothers Im glad to see you
Let me tell you a story A man
a sower was sowing in his field
One seed fell on the road -- the
brids ate it Another fell on
stones and died But another took
root sprouted became grain and
fed many people

(pause)
Dont you have ears Do you hear
me
ZEBEDEE
(beligerent)

I got ears but I dont understand
Be clearer

Jesus thinks then says softly

JESUS
I am the sower

ZEBEDEE ‘
God help us I suppose were the
stones

A moment of confusion Zebedee says to those near him

ZEBEDEE
Another beggar

John an open-faced fuzzy-cheeked boy about 19 leaves his
father and approaches Jesus

JOHN
Rabbi tell me If you are the
sower and we are the stones what
is the seed

Jesus is baffled he has no answer John repeats the
question

JOHN
What is the seed you offer

The answer comes to Jesus

JESUS
Love one another Love one another

The crowd whispers What did he say “Love each other

TABAS
Thats stupid Were starving
Tortured Hungry How can hungry
people love each other

JUDAS
(steps forward)

CUT TO
EXT TEMPLE AT JERUSALEM - DAY

Prior to the Passover feast from the 15th to the 25rb of
Adar every Jewish male had to Pay a temple tax in the
amount of one Galilean shekel Since the coin of the land
was Roman (and to a lesser extent Persian Tyrian and Syrian)
money-changers were needed to exchange Roman denarii for
shekels Obviously they made a profit on this exchange

The money-changers had permanent booths outside the temple
proper To a stranger the temple looked more like a brokerage
house than a place of worship

Jesus enters the temple grounds with his central core of
disciples They have come to worship

Jesus comes to a cold stop hes sickened by the sight of
the money-changers He tums to Peter

JESUS
What is this

PETER
Its for the feast

Jesus enraged strides past the booths overturning the
tables Scales weights and coins from all over the world

Scatter in every direction The vendors rush to retrieve
their money

Other vendors and customers turn on Jesus Judas Peter and
the others forcibly fight them off Jesus calls out

JESUS
My fathers house is a Place of
worship not a bank or a store

The disciples circle Jesus for his protection The RABBI
surrounded by SADDUCEES steps out of the temple

RABBI
Nazarene what are you doing

JESUS
God doesnt need a fancy house He
doesnt need cyprus and bloody
animals For years I used to come
to the temple but now the temple
has come to me

SADDUCEE
(shocked)
Watch what you say
JESUS
When I say I Rabbi I am saying

RABBI

Blasphemy Make no mistake 1

53 The Sadduccee whispers to an associate then Says to Jesus

SADDUCCEE
Take your ideas to the Romans

JESUS
Im sick of all of you This temple
will be destroyed “One stone wont
stand on another God does not
belong in a ghetto God is not
an Israelite

Even the disciples are shocked by this heresy They escort
Jesus out of the temple grounds for his own safety

As they reach the temple gates they are mobbed by the poor
and the infirm waiting outside The beggars press on Jesus

pulling at his arms an legs

MOB MEMBER 1
Heal me

MOB MEMBER 2
Cure us Make us rich

MOB MEMBER 2
Do a miracle

JESUS

(pushes them away)
Get away You sicken me Youre
selfish and full of hate God

This new crisis is broken up by four Roman cavalrymen They
stampede into the mob whipping beggars and curlosity-seekers
alike The OFFICER demands

given the money to the poor

Jesus speaks with a new air of authority “quieter but
more forceful

JESUS
Youll always have the poor
Thomas but you wont always

Jesus bends over and kisses the top of Magdalenes head
Then he takes her hand instructing her to rise

JOHN

temple until it reaches Solomons Porch Jesus dismounts
and looks around

Outside the temple walls stalls occupy every nook and
cranny Hundreds of people are selling buying bargaining
hawking their wares merchants money-changers innkeepers

on the wine stands and workshops overturning the tables
striking the tradesmen with his goad

The mob enthusiastically follows suit looting stalls and
routing merchants

Temple Guards to put down their weapons and withdraw

There is no longer anyone for the rebels to attack The
Levites are in the temple the Romans in the palace

toward the meeting place The traditional Passover psalm
echoes from behind closed doors they pass

Judas taps a secret knock Peter opens the door cautiously
and lets them enter

A high window lets moonlight into the large room Three’
seven-branched candelabra illuminate the lamb wine and
unleavened bread

The disciples are seated on cushions around three sides of
a square table The fourth is open to facilitate serving
Jesus takes his place at the center of the table

Mary Martha and Magdalene have all come to Jerusalem to
celebrate the festival with Jesus and his disciples and
prepare the ritual meal

Jesus fills the disciples’ cups from a pitcher of salt water

JESUS
First we must drink salt water to
remember the tears and pain our
ancestors suffered in the land of
Egypt

Jesus swallows his drink in a single gulp Mary brings a
tray of bitter herbs proscribed by Jewish law oregano
bay and savory Jesus watches as the disciples eat

from slavery to freedom Tonights

(to Matthew)
John you know the prophets Isaiah
says ‘He had neither beauty nor
luster that we would turn our eyes
to him He was despised and rejected
by me

JOHN
(continues)
But he took on himself all
our pains He was wounded for our
transgressions and with his stripes
we were healed’

JESUS
(interrupting)
He was scourged and afflicted
yet like a lamb led to the
slaughter he opened not his mouth
(a beat)
My dear wonderful friends I am
the lamb And I will not open my
mouth

The disciples exchange fearful glances

‘PHILIP
I dont understand We didnt come
to Jerusalem to die we came to rule

PETE
If you die Ill die first Because
I will be at your side

JESUS

Be quiet What did you have before
I found you Nothing

(no answer)
Now you have Gods love -- and
eternal life Dont worry You
wont die yet Theres still a
lot of work to do We havent
come to rule but to serve Ill
rise from the dead to lead you

The disciples stare in shocked silence Jesus has either
gone completely mad -- or he is the Messiah

Jesus breaks the bread loaves and passes them around
He pours wine for the others

JESUS
Take and eat this is my body
Drink this is my blood

As they do the bread and the wine transubstantiate into
flesh and blood in their mouths Peter is the first to
cough up the bloody flesh The others sickened follow
They wipe their bloody mouths

John starts to weep Jesus turns to Judas

JESUS
Go and do what you promised

As Judas exits Peter says angrily

PETER
Where is he going

JESUS
Dont stop him The wheel is already
in motion Tonight well go to
Gethsemane to pray

CUT TO
EXT GETHSEMANE - NIGHT
Jesus and the disciples cross the Kidron River and approach

Gethsemane a 3-acre park on the eastern slope of the Mount
of Olives

Just east of the walls the Kidron Valley lies between
Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives Today as then it is

a necropolis outside the walls As they walk Jesus and
his disciples pass the monumental Hellenistic tombs of
Bene Hezir and Absalom -- silent testimonials which

still stand today

As they climb the steep hills of Gethsemane Jesus leaves
most of his group behind and proceeds with Peter James
and John Passing through thick gnarled olive groves
they reach a clearing marked by three boulders

JESUS
Wait for me here

Jesus walks alone until he finds a secluded spot Pulling
his tunic around him he kneels beneath an ancient tree

Jesus self-control which had been superhuman to this
point melts away His body shakes sweat drops from his
forehead down his cheeks

JESUS
Abba Father weve been together a
long time Ive had many doubts

I never asked to be chosen but I
always obeyed I turned on my
mother I gave up Magdalene Ive
never had a family never had a bed
to sleep in Ive never made love

hallucinations have followed me my
whole life

Jesus exhausted pauses He looks down takes a breath
and continues

JESUS
Youve done many miracles You
opened the Red Sea saved Noah
you took Elijah directly to heaven
in a fiery chariot Now you ask
Me to take crucifixion and hold it
in my lips like a thorny rose Is
death the only answer for me Is
there no way you can take this
bitter cup from my hands

Jesus waits for the answer that doesnt come He looks
one way then the other The wind blows sadly through
the trees

A GUARDIAN ANGEL in the form of a nine-year-old girl
appears She sets a silver chalice before Jesus

JESUS (V0)
Is this your answer

The Angel drinks from the cup then hands it to Jesus
As she does she and the cup vanish

JESUS (V0)
Your will be done I only ask for
strength

Jesus wipes tne sweat and tears from his face He pulls
himself to his feet heads back

At the three-cock point he finds Peter James and John
fast asleep Johns head rests peacefully on his
brothers chest Jesus is tempted not to wake them

JESUS
(seftly)
Couldnt you stay awake with me for
just an hour

Feter is the first to awake Ashamed he falls at Jesus
eet

PETER
Forgive me

Jesus hears the sound of soldiers in the distance

JESUS
It doesnt matter Its too late
The time has come

Jesus hears the evening nightingale overhead He smells
the vernal perfumes of the garden A feeling of peace
sweeps over him He smiles at James and John as they
awaken

Judas and a band of armed Temple Guards and Romans burst
into the clearing Peter pulls his dagger Jesus pushes

him back Judas greets his master

JUDAS
Welcome Rabbi

Judas kisses him fiercely on the mouth Jesus embraces
his faithful disciple Tears stream down Judas cheeks

Peter pulls his knife and slices off one of the Temple
Guards ears This is not random but calculated violence --
because a Levite cannot serve as a Temple Guard if he is
physically deformed Peters reaction is not one of
disappointment but achievement As if saying So there

Jesus pushes Judas unwillingly away picks up the severed
ear off the ground and miraculously restores it to the Levite

JESUS
(to Peter)
Welcome the messengers of God

cross as he struggles across his rocky dolorosa

The blood has dried on his tunic He still wears his thorny
“crown”

The sympathies of the rabble have shifted Now its just
another show a multiple crucifixion Laughter ridicule
figs for sale Jesus weakens His knees buckle and he
falls

they lead Jesus forward

site Toward the rear afraid to approach» Magdalene Mary

The Romans bring Jesus to the peak of the hill and strip
him naked Two other criminals are prepared for crucifixion

Jesus looks at the rough-hewn cross laid before him He
searches the crowd -

JESUS (V0)

He spots his Mother and waves to her

JESUS (V0)
(continuing)
Farewell Forgive me for being a

bad son
Saul arrogant his hands on his hips stands watching

Two SOLDIERS grab Jesus by the arms

FIRST SOLDIER
Alright Your Majesty its time to
get on your throne

They stretch Jesus out on the cross while slave laborers
finish preparing the post hole for the cross

JESUS (V0)
Dont give up on me

The Soldiers place the crude spikes against Jesus’ palms
The sound of METAL AGAINST METAL rings out as the hammer
comes down

A bloody mist sprays on Jesus face He grimaces but does
not cry out

Martha and the three Marys hide their faces Near Jesus
the other criminals are being impaled

The Romans fasten ropes around Jesus arms The spikes
alone will not support his weight

It takes three soldiers to hoist’ Jesus cross upright Now
suddenly he is above the masses All of Jerusalem is
within view

In the distance he sees the temple The outer veil glows in
the midday sum a blood-red vision

His body jars into place The pain is excruciating His
fellow criminals howl in agony

Jesus surveys the mob a sea of hostile faces He finds
Magdalene Mary Martha and his Mother standing in a group
His heart goes out to Magdalene

The Sadducees are satisfied the Romans are complacent
Groups of townspeople and schoolboys point out the suffer-
ings of the condemned men

JESUS (V0)

Father Zorgive them

The sky changes color Horses buckle under their riders

screams

The sky turns a pleasant pale blue Jesus looks up at the
thick white cumulous clouds floating on the horizon
Birds sing in the distance

He thinks Am I dead No the crowd is still there SILENT
On either side of Jesus his fellow criminals writhe in
silent agony

The Angel from Gethsemane appears before him He has seen
many angels in his life but never one as beautiful as this
Her soft blonde hair falls on her shoulders In the garden
he was too frightened to notice her true beauty

JESUS
Who are you

GUARDIAN ANGEL
Im your guardian angel Remember
when God told Abraham to sacrifice
his son Just as Abraham lifted the
knife God spared Isaac Your father
sent me here He is God of mercy
not punishment He saw you and
said Take care of him Hes suffered
enough He tested you -- and is
pleased He doesnt want your blood
Come with me

In a moment Jesus and the Guardian Angel are standing at
the foot of the cross They pass through the silent crowd
unnoticed Jesus looks over his shoulder his cross is

empty

JESUS
(relieved)
You mean Im not the Messiah

No

Jesus smiles he is finally free of God

fidence He speaks with the evangelistic fervor of a
born-again Christian

I was once a sinner the greatest
of sinners You mame it I did it
Whored drank murdered -- yes
murdered Then one day returning
to Damascus I was struck by a
burning light and a voice called
to me ‘Saul why are you persecuting
me What did I ever do to you
‘Who are you I said ‘Jesus’
the voice replied Scales fell
from my burning eyes I was
baptized and became Paul the
apostle and now I bring the Good
News to every country

BETHANY VILLAGER

PAUL
Jesus of Nazareth - you must have
heard of him He wasnt the son of
Mary he was the son of God His
mother was a virgin Gabriel came
to earth and put Gods seed in her
womb He took on our sins he was
tortured crucified -- but three days
later he rose again and ascended to
heaven Death was conquered praise
God Death was conquered and the
Gates of Heaven are now open to
everyone

Jesus has been rising to a slow boil He can restrain
himself no longer He calls out

JESUS
Did you ever see this resurrected
Jesus of Nazareth

PAUL
I saw a blinding flash of light and
I heard his voice

JESUS
Liar

PAUL
His disciples saw him They were
hiding in an attic with the doors
locked when suddenly he appeared
before them Thomas wasnt convinced
but he put his fingers in his wounds
and gave him some fish which he ate

JESUS
Liar

Disgusted Jesus tums and walks away His Angel follows

Paul excuses himself from his listeners He and his YOUNG
ASSISTANT follow Jesus down the road

Jesus feels Pauls footsteps drawing closer Hes about
to explode Suddenly he turns on his heel grabs Paul
by the shoulders and shakes him violently

JESU
(continuing)

The whole world is before me --

Rome You dont know what a joy
it is to set out in the morning

A feeble man steps forward

young and foolish I called you the
rock the rock upon which I would
build my church But now you look
more like a sponge What happened

And you Philip you were so strong
and now youve become fat I loved

ran and hid under the skirts of
Mary and Martha You became a fake
Lazarus to save yourself

PETER
Dont you have any respect

JUDAS
For him He was supposed to lead
an army of angels Instead he came
here to stud women

JESUS
Judas cant you be more kind

JUDAS
Rabbi you broke my heart How
can I be kind Sometimes I want
to scream and bang my head against
a rock and curse the day I ever met
you We held the world in our
hands Remember what you said to
me You took me in your arms and
begged me Betray me betray me
I must be crucified so I can be
resurrected to save the world

The wounds in Jesus hands and feet begin to bleed

JUDAS
(continuing)
I am the lamb you bleated
Death is the door Judas my
brother dont be afraid Help me

Judas eyes fill with moisture

All their eyes tur to the Arab servant boy who is now
crouched on the table like a gargoyle As they watch he
transforms into the young Archangel from the Idumaea
desert His black spiked wings rise above his back

JUDAS
(continuing)
Satan

(to Jesus)
Shame on you traitor

The others join in They spit at Jesus feet and call him
names coward traitor

We believed in you You betrayed
us

They turn and leave in a group Jesus is alone with Satan
Jesus looks at the great Archangel

Satan floats off the table and heads toward the door
SATAN
Goodbye Jesus of Nazareth I
told you we would meet again

Satan walks into the night All is silence Jesus looks
around the room

After a moment Jesus walks through the open door
CUT TO
EXT MARY AND MARTHAS - NIGHT
Jesus steps on the deserted street The village is still
There is a red glow in the distance Jerusalem is burning

He surveys the empty street Blood still stains his hands
and feet

The old man gets on his hands and knees in the middle of the
road He lifts his head toward heaven

JESUS
Abba father will you still listen
to me Are you still there

(MORE)

JESUS (CONTD)
Will you listen to a selfish
unfaithful son I fought you when
you called I resisted I thought
I knew more I didnt want to be
your son Can you forgive me I
didnt fight hard enough I want
to take your hand I want to save
my fellow men Father take me back
Kill the fatted calf I want to be
your son I want to pay the price
I want to be crucified and rise
