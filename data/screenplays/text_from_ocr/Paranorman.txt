1 INT RESEARCH LABORATORY - NIGHT 1

An attractive FEMALE SCIENTIST in a gore-spattered lab
coat moves fearfully along a wall passing benches strewn
with broken lab equipment Her ample bosom heaves as she
PANTS nervously mascara-rimmed eyes darting to and fro
Glass SMASHES on the floor nearby and MELODRAMATIC MUSIC
swells The woman backs into a shadow not noticing a
pair of dead eyes catching the moonlight behind her

The music climbs to a frenzy as something GROANS horribly
into the womans ear She spins around on her stiletto
heels as a rotted face looms out of the darkness
drooling through broken teeth and lunges at her neck

ZOMBIE
Brains
CLOSE ON the woman as she raises her hands and SCREAMS

cut To

INT BABCOCKS HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Eleven year-old NORMAN BABCOCK sits on the floor

watching TV He has large piercing eyes and a messy shock
of hair The movie scene we just witnessed continues off-
screen with the sound of bloodcurdling SCREAMS

Behind him sitting upon a sofa is GRANDMA BABCOCK a
plump old lady squinting through thick glasses

GRANDMA BABCOCK
Whats happening now

NORMAN
The zombie is eating her head
Grandma
GRANDMA BABCOCK
Thats not very nice Whats he
doing that for

NORMAN
Because hes a zombie Thats what
they do

GRANDMA BABCOCK
Well hes going to ruin his
dinner Im sure if they just

through itd be a different story
Norman CHUCKLES as if the idea is absurd then winces as
he hears his father shout from the kitchen

PERRY BABCOCK (0S)

Norman nods to her and shuffles over to the kitchen door

INT BABCOCKS HOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Normans mother SANDRA BABCOCK is emptying the
dishwasher She is in her late thirties and wears â€˜mom
clothes that do no favors for her figure His father
PERRY BABCOCK is older with a neatly-trimmed beard
trying hard to delineate chin from neck He stands on a
chair decked out in tool belt and safety goggles even
though hes only changing a light bulb in a ceiling
fixture

Sandra smiles at her son as he makes his way silently to
an overstuffed trash can as tall as he is

SANDRA BABCOCK
Hi Whatcha watching in there
NORMAN
Sex and violence

SANDRA BABCOCK
Oh Thats nice
Perry glares over as Norman wrestles with the garbage

PERRY BABCOCK
Cant you be like other kids your
age and pitch a tent in the yard
or have a healthy interest in
carpentry

SANDRA BABCOCK
Perry

NORMAN
thought you said kids my age
were too busy shoplifting and
joyriding

SANDRA BABCOCK

Norman

He hefts the bag onto the floor and ties it in a knot
ParaNorman 3

Breezing into the kitchen through the back door while
CHATTING inanely on her cell phone Normans older sister
COURTNEY is fifteen years-old and is the bleached-blonde
cheerleader archetype of every schoolboys sordid dreams

COURTNEY
Oh yeah hes r-i-double p-e-d
Like a seven pack at least

(TO NORMAN)
Ew Watch it
She pushes her brother out of the way as he drags the
garbage outside

SANDRA BABCOCK
Courtney be nice

COURTNEY
Yeah she totally doesnt deserve
him I mean shes nice and I
really like her but shes a
complete loser Yeah I know
Courtney slumps into a chair at the table twisting a
strand of gum out of her mouth with a finger
Norman returns inside and shuts the door pausing a
moment as if thinking something over

NORMAN
Dad Grandma says Can you turn
up the heating Her feet are
cold
The bubble Courtney is blowing POPS against her face
Perry rolls his eyes and GROANS and Sandra pales

SANDRA BABCOCK
Now Perry

PERRY BABCOCK
How many times do we have to go
through this Son Your
grandmother is dead

NORMAN
I know

PERRY BABCOCK
Then why do you keep on talking to
her

NORMAN
Because she talks back

COURTNEY
O-M-G you are such a liar
ParaNorman 4

NORMAN
Im not making this up I swear
She talks to me all the time

COURTNEY
Oh yeah Prove it
Norman levels her a look that says you asked for this

NORMAN
She said its not very ladylike to
hide photos of the High School
quarterback with his shirt off in
your underwear drawer
Sandra and Perry raise their eyebrows

COURTNEY
I knew it Youve been sneaking
around in my personal stuff
NORMAN
No I havent Grandma told me

COURTNEY
You are the worst
Courtney brimming with outrage storms out of the
kitchen her ponytail wagging furiously behind her
Sandra kneels down beside Norman with a wearily
sympathetic smile

SANDRA BABCOCK
Norman I know you and Grandma
were very close but we all have
to move on Grandmas in a better
place now

NORMAN
No shes not shes in the living
room
Perry throws his arms in the air swaying on the chair

PERRY BABCOCK
Your grandmother was old and sick
and she died Thats all there is
to it

SANDRA BABCOCK
Perry this is just part of the
mourning process
ParaNorman 5

PERRY BABCOCK
Stop indulging him Im nothing if
Im not liberal but that limp-
wristed hippie garbage needs to
be nipped in the bud
Norman SIGHS and steps between his parents as they argue
He mutely heads out of the room

EXT BABCOCKS HOUSE FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS
The argument in the kitchen continues slightly muted
PERRY BABCOCK (0S)

This behavior might be okay with
your side of the family but Im
not putting up with it anymore
Not me

SANDRA BABCOCK (0S)
Oh not this again

PAN UP to find a light go on in Normans bedroom window

INT BABCOCKS HOUSE NORMANS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Norman sits on his bed using a couple of zombie action
figures to act out his parents ongoing discussion

which carries upstairs

Norman gets up off the bed and approaches the door

PERRY BABCOCK
This isnt the West Coast Sandra
people talk They do

SANDRA BABCOCK (0S)
Hes just sensitive Perry

PERRY BABCOCK (0S)

Oh please sensitive is writing
poetry and being lousy at team
sports not this I wont have
him turn out like that uncle of
yours If that crazy old tramp has
been around here putting ideas in
Normans head

SANDRA BABCOCK (0S)

Perry no ones had anything to do
with Uncle Prenderghast in years
bet he doesnt even know what
Norman looks like

ParaNorman 6

Norman quietly closes the door and the room goes black

6 INT MR PRENDERGHASTS HOUSE STUDY - NIGHT 6

CLOSE ON a faded photograph of Norman held in the grimy

hand of MR PRENDERGHAST He stands
scattered with pictures of Norman

over a dusty desk
Sandra and older

family members He is in a dark study a wall-to-wall
trove of curious miscellanea and dumpster-dived junk

MR PRENDERGHAST
Not much time not much time
He pulls an old leather-bound book out from the mess and
traces a finger over a woodcut illustration on its cover
an ethereal woman lying beneath a cluster of stars
Wincing with pain the man drops the book and clutches at
his chest COUGHING and GASPING horribly
CAMERA PANS to a wall covered in countless photographs
newspaper clippings and scrawled occult markings It is a
shrine of sorts a madmans recondite genealogy project
and at its center is a photograph of Norman posing with
his family on vacation
ZOOM IN to the photograph hurtling past the Babcocks and
through dense trees further and further into a dark
forest

TITLE PARANORMAN

INT BABCOCKS HOUSE NORMANS BEDROOM - MORNING

Norman opens bleary eyes turns off his zombie hand alarm
clock and slides out of bed

8 INT BABCOCKS HOUSE LIVING ROOM - MORNING 8

Dressed for school Norman pauses at the front door and
turns to look at the sofa in the living room He waves

happily and Grandma smiles back

Courtney passes him as she comes down the stairs in the
opposite direction She also stops to look at the sofa
but to her eyes it is empty She sneers contemptuously

EXT SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING

Norman ambles past houses and lawns spotted with small-
town America detritus cheap plastic lawn furniture
peeling-paint fences and cookie-cutter topiary Here the
quaint colonial buildings are mostly in disrepair their
picket fences rotten or daubed in graffiti

ParaNorman 7
9 9
Norman is watched dubiously by the occasional passer-by
as he shouts amiable greetings to people who simply
arent there

NORMAN
Good morning Hey Bruce Hows it
goin Not much Im kind of late
for school I need to go Hi nice
to see you guys Good morning
Sorry I gotta run Excuse me
Pardon me See ya
At one street corner Norman bends over a gutter He is
watched curiously by a man retrieving his morning paper
across the other side of the street
MANS POV - Norman crouches over the flattened remains of
raccoon road kill

NORMAN (CONTD)
Hey there little buddy Cmere
He realizes he is being stared at and slowly turns to
face the onlooker then hurries away
Though no one else sees them to Normans eyes a whole
host of ghosts are meandering through the streets

NORMAN (CONTD)
Yeah good to see you How you
doin Hi Mrs Hardman You look
nice today I like what youve
done with your hair

HAIRDRYER GHOST
Does anyone smell burning

HIPPY GHOST
Hey peace man

NORMAN

CIVIL WAR GHOST

ParaNorman 8

MOBSTER GHOST
Hey how you doin
A little further along Norman nods pleasantly to the
ghost of a parachutist impaled in the branches of a
roadside tree

NORMAN
Hi Hows it hanging

PARACHUTIST GHOST
Ho ho Havent heard that one
before Well its a nice day

11 11
EXT MAIN STREET - MORNING

Its industrial days now rusted behind it Blithe Hollow
has become a run-down tourist town celebrating its
heritage with lame fetes and crass knick-knacks A
massive billboard beside the main square reads BLITHE
HOLLOW - A GREAT PLACE TO HANG illustrated by a group
of waving Puritans beside an equally cheerful witch
hanging from a gallows Across the street a huge banner
suggests this year is particularly important for the
town BLITHE HOLLOW - 300 BEWITCHIN YEARS

The town center is lacking in charm its historical
buildings subsumed into a vulgar modern thoroughfare with
gaudy witch-themed shop fronts and cracked sidewalks
Everywhere Norman walks the witch theme is prevalent
Cars have bumper stickers that extol such witticisms as
MY OTHER CAR IS A BROOM Theres a dingy bar the BAR
GENTO and a greeting card store called BEST WITCHES
Norman hurries past SHERIFF HOOPER a heavyset black
woman and DEPUTY DWAYNE lanky and awkward and looking
like hed rather be elsewhere

SHERIFF HOOPER
Watch and learn Parking
violation is my middle name

DEPUTY DWAYNE
Really I thought it was Rhona
They glance up disdainfully as Norman passes by Clearly
in this town Norman has something of a bad reputation

12 EXT SCHOOL ENTRANCE - MORNING 12

Norman walks up a tree lined path that leads to a squat
school building Out front the name BLITHE HOLLOW
MIDDLE SCHOOL is carved into an ugly hunk of granite
ParaNorman 9

12 12

SCHOOL KIDS line the path in front of Norman a gauntlet
of jeering merciless pre-pubescent horror Norman takes
a deep breath as he begins his daily walk of ridicule
Most of the kids give him a wide berth but others sneer
and WHISPER as he passes

A bell RINGS the start of the school day and everyone
makes a bee-line for the building

Someone barges Norman with their shoulder knocking his
backpack to the ground Other kids SNICKER as they step
over him

As the last of them head through the lobby doors Norman
is left alone on the path

Norman bends down to retrieve his spilled possessions
and a dark shape beyond the gate catches his eye
NORMANS POV - Mr Prenderghast barely visible as he
stands within the shadow of a tree stares back at him
Norman frowns and squints his eyes but now sees only
trees and shadows so he continues up the steps

13 13
INT SCHOOL HALLWAY LOCKERS - MORNING

An expanse of unevenly lacquered floor scuffed by scores
of dragged heels Rows of dented lockers line the walls
Norman stands before his locker across which someone has
daubed the word FREAK in marker Clearly something of a
daily ritual he reaches inside takes out a bottle of
surface cleaner and a rag and proceeds to wipe it off
Across the hallway another kid is removing graffiti from
his locker NEIL is overweight with frizzy red hair and
is busily rubbing a handkerchief over the word FATTY
He watches Norman with interest

A voice behind his shoulder gives Norman a start

ALVIN
Hey ghost jerk You know what
Norman turns to find textbook bully ALVIN the only 6th
grader in his class who shaves looming over him He is
flanked by a couple of leering sycophants one of whom
wears a T-shirt emblazoned with TEAM ALVIN

Norman SIGHS

NORMAN
What do you want Alvin

ALVIN
Why dont you see some more
ghosts goober
ParaNorman 10

13 13
The kids LAUGH uproariously encouraging Alvin to show
off some more

ALVIN (CONTD)
Hey Hey Norman
Alvin points to a fly that has landed on the locker
beside him He swats it flat with his hand

ALVIN (CONTD)
Talk to that
The kids around Alvin burst into LAUGHTER

ALVIN (CONTD)
That is so Alvin
The bullies strut away content in the psychological
damage theyve managed to inflict

fq

fq

PUG
Loser

ALVIN
That was good right guys
Norman mutters as they leave but not loud enough so as
anyone might hear

fq

NORMAN
Flies dont talk
Across the hall Neil continues to watch with sympathy
but he is already being hurried along by his friend
SALMA a nerdy Indian kid with braces

SALMA
Neil come on Lets go

INT SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - DAY

Amidst stacked bleachers foam mats and stray dodge
balls a crudely constructed stage fills one end of the
gymnasium Mediocre art class scenery represents a
colonial town complete with plywood hills chapel and
crescent moon dangling perilously from a basketball hoop
In a directors chair far too small for the job is MRS
HENSCHER an imposing woman with spectacles and beret who
looks like she smells of too-much perfume

At the front of the stage wearing a pilgrim hat and
carrying a large scroll is NORMAN He is surrounded by
kids whose attempts at home made period costume leave a
lot to be desired

ParaNorman 11

14 14

MRS HENSCHER
You stink of illiteracy

(A BEAT)
Pilgrims The Mayflower Dont any
of you know anything about the
history of this town
Mrs Henscher tries her best to remain unfazed

MRS HENSCHER (CONTD)

Puritans were strict and devout

settlers who came here to build a

home a place without sin What is

it now Salma

Salma is holding her hand up She looks like the Wicked
Witch of the West Even beneath green makeup and plastic
warty nose it is clear she is not best pleased

SALMA
Why is the witch always a hideous
old crone with a pointy hat anda
broomstick I dont believe its
historically accurate Mrs
Henscher
Mrs Henschers knuckles clench white around her script
She attempts an understanding smile in the same way a
shark might

MRS HENSCHER
Its not supposed to be Its
supposed to sell postcards and key
chains
(CLAPS HANDS)
So lets try it again Top of page
six Norman
Norman skips ahead on his scroll

NORMAN
The founding fathers of Blithe
Hollow discovered an evil witch
amongst them

MRS HENSCHER
No no Norman with gusto Like
this
Waving her arms theatrically she bellows Normans lines
milking every syllable for effect

MRS HENSCHER (CONTD)
They put her on trial and hanged
her

(MORE)
ParaNorman 12

14 14

MRS HENSCHER (CONTD)

But the vengeful witch cursed her
accusers seven of them in all to
die a horrible and gruesome death
and rise from their graves as the
living dead their souls doomed to
an eternity of damnation

(A BEAT)
Now I want you to try that again
but with conviction My reputation
is at stake here and I wont have
this turn out like that wretched
Kabuki debacle of oh-nine
As she launches into her lecture Norman notices a change
in the room The lights dim the wind outside picks up
and indistinct shapes flicker at the corners of his eyes
Norman glances around at the other kids on the stage to
see if they are seeing what he is seeing For a split
second the children are replaced with faded figures in
real Puritan dress Seven solemn figures
As he turns around nervously Norman sees the suggestion
of another place fizzing in and out of the shadows

MRS HENSCHER (CONTD)
Norman Are you listening to me
boy
Norman is brought back to the real world with a start
and nods timidly from behind his scroll

NORMAN
Sorry Mrs Henscher

MRS HENSCHER
So am I Now unless theres any
other issues let us resume
They put her on trial and hanged
her
Neil turns excitedly to Norman

NEIL
Ooh This is my moment
He shuffles toward Salma and swings his branch around
not realizing Alvin has slung the hangmans noose around
Normans neck
Norman is yanked off balance and staggers into Neil who
eels over rigid branch arms unable to stop his fall He
lands on top of Salma her kicking legs sticking out from
under him as though Dorothys house had just landed on
stage
The kids break into uncontrollable LAUGHTER
ParaNorman 13

14 14

ALVIN
Boom baby

NEIL
Sorry
Mrs Henscher flings her script into the air her face
beet red

MRS HENSCHER
Oh you useless bunch of
The school bell RINGS drowning out her howling voice

15 15
INT SCHOOL HALLWAY LOCKERS - LATER

As kids hotfoot it out of the building as quickly as
possible Norman stands pitiably in front of his locker
Fresh graffiti reads SEE YOU TOMORROW FREAK

Norman heads for the door and pretends not to hear when
Neil shouts out behind him
NEIL
Norman wait up

16 16
EXT MAIN STREET - LATER

Norman keeps going but Neil quickly catches up
intently at the side of his head

NORMAN
I keep telling you Neil I like
to be alone

NEIL
So do I Lets do it together
You shouldnt let them get you
down They always do stuff like
that to me

NORMAN
Why

NEIL
Because Im fat And my allergies
make my eyes leak And I sweat
when I walk too fast And I have a
lunchbox with a kitten on it And
I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome I
guess theres a whole bunch of
stuff

NORMAN
Doesnt it bother you
ParaNorman 14

16 16

NEIL
Nah You cant stop bullying its
part of human nature If you were
bigger and more stupid youd
probably be a bully too Its
called survival of the thickest

1717

EXT URBAN STREET - DAY

beaming
Norman and Neil walk away from the school along a tree
lined street at the end of which stands a huge
commemorative statue It is a grotesque effigy of the
evil witch from the local legend

MR PRENDERGHAST (0S)
Psssst
The boys stop It seems to be coming from the witch

NEIL
That statue just pissst at us
Wild-eyed Mr Prenderghast suddenly leaps in front of
them startling them as he staggers closer

MR PRENDERGHAST
You know who I am

NEIL
The weird stinky old bum who lives
up the hill

MR PRENDERGHAST
(points to Norman)
I was asking him

NORMAN
Yes I know I was told not to
talk to you Sorry
Mr Prenderghast steps in front of Neil leaning closer to
Norman and whispering conspiratorially

MR PRENDERGHAST
And you know why youre not
supposed to talk to me
Norman tries to back away

MR PRENDERGHAST (CONTD)

I can see ghosts too And I know
thats not all youve been seeing
lately is it Bad omens Things
you cant quite explain Strange
faces peering through the veil
Normans eyes widen further
ParaNorman 15

17 17
MR PRENDERGHAST (CONTD)

And Ill bet no one told you about
the witchs curse did they
NORMAN

Actually were learning about it

in school

NEIL

(BEAMING PROUDLY)

Im a tree

Mr Prenderghast impatiently turns his back on Neil and

leans close to Norman

MR PRENDERGHAST

Theres something you really need

to know This is the most
important thing you will ever

hear The fate of everyone depends

on it Now listen close The

witchs curse is real and youre

the one who has to stop it

Mr Prenderghast grabs Normans arm and leans closer

MR PRENDERGHAST (CONTD)

Youve gotta use your gift of
talking to the dead

He breaks into a HACKING COUGH
bloodshot eyes bulging

MR PRENDERGHAST (CONTD)

Because if you dont the witchs

ghost

(COUGHING)
And this is the most important

face turning beet red and

thing of all You have to go up

to the old graveyard and

NEIL (0S)
Leave him alone

An apple bounces off Mr Prenderghasts head He turns to
find Neil standing behind them on the path lunchbox open
in his hand providing leftover low-carb ammunition

NEIL (CONTD)

Dont make me throw this hummus

Its spicy

Mr Prenderghast thinks better of it and turns to flee the
scene He HISSES out of the side of his mouth at Norman

ParaNorman 16
17 MR PRENDERGHAST

This aint done with Youll see

it soon enough Watch for the

sign

As he hobbles away Neil peers down the street after the
old man

NEIL
Jeez what a dirty old creep

NORMAN
Hes my uncle

NEIL
So is it true

NORMAN

What
Norman just stares at him

NEIL
Can you see ghosts Like
everywhere All the time

NORMAN
Uh yeah

NEIL
Awesome Do you think you can see
my dog Bub He was run over by an
animal rescue van Tragic and
ironic We buried him in the yard
Could you see him
Norman frowns disbelievingly completely taken aback

NORMAN
Maybe

NEIL
Sweet Come on

20 20

EXT NEILS DRIVEWAY

Neil forcibly drags Norman up the front driveway of a
pastel-painted house A pair of legs spotted in oil stick
out from beneath a pimped-up camper van

Neils brother MITCH calls out from under the van

MITCH
Neil That you
ParaNorman 17

20 20

NEIL
Hey Mitch Were gonna go play
with the dead dog in the garden
and were not even gonna have to
dig him up first
Mitch sits up Hes a strapping six-foot jock with
tattooed biceps The kind of guy who wears year-round
flip-flops

MITCH
Whatd you say
Mitch pulls his brother aside so as to exclude Norman
who stands awkwardly a little way away surrounded by
cheery lawn ornaments and ineptly manicured topiary

MITCH (CONTD)
Neil isnt he that weird kid
Yknow Look at me I talk to
ghosts so people will pay
attention to me
Mitch makes a goofy face and twitches farcically

NEIL
Can you stop doing that Its
kinda stupid

MITCH
Now listen to me you dont need
to be hanging out with weird
people Thats a tip
Neil scowls at his brother

NEIL
Dont blow this for me Mitch
This ones not weird He talks to
dead people
Neil has had enough and defiantly walks away from his
brother

21 21
EXT NEILS GARDEN - LATER

Neil rummages around in the bushes of his back yard
surrounded by a gloriously tasteless menagerie of lawn
ornaments Norman stands slightly to one side surveying
the rows of plastic gnomes and wondering if he should
have gone straight home after all

NEIL
Hes around here somewhere

(A BEAT)
So does everyone come back as a
ghost
ParaNorman 18

21 21
Norman hesitates This level of interest is new to him

NORMAN
No My grandma told me its
usually people who still have
stuff to figure out Or sometimes
its the ones who died suddenly
or in a bad way
A BARK and Norman turns to see a translucent puppy
wagging its tail cheerfully despite being chopped neatly
into two halves

NORMAN (CONTD)
Bub

NEIL

Is he there Hows he look

Bub BARKS then his front half notices his tail and runs
behind to sniff his own backside

NORMAN

Uh good

Bub bounds over to Neil runs clean through his chubby
calves then doubles back for another try

NORMAN (CONTD)
Hes happy to see you

NEIL

(DOGGY VOICE)
Whos a good boy huh Good boy

(TO NORMAN)
Can he feel it if I pet him

NORMAN
Yeah I guess
Neil bends over and kisses the air by his ankles making
a coochy-coo face

NORMAN (CONTD)
Uh thats not his chin
Neil stops mid-smooch and quickly stands up
Norman watches as Neil picks up a stick and waves it in
front of Bubs nose even though he cant see him

NEIL
Go get it

NORMAN
He cant fetch it yknow
ParaNorman 19

21 21

NEIL
Yeah well its still fun Good

Bub Good boy
CLOSE ON Norman as he watches Neil toss the stick back
and forth across the garden The stick lands near his
feet and he bends down to pick it up

NEIL (CONTD)
Why dont you try

NORMAN

NEIL

No no its fun Try it

NORMAN

knocking him over

NORMAN

As Norman runs over to him Neil lies on his back
GIGGLING the stick held between his teeth

NEIL

ParaNorman 20

21 21
CLOSE ON NORMAN as a smile creeps across his face and he
starts to LAUGH

NORMAN
Are you okay
CUT WIDE as the two kids enjoy their play the sun above
them breaking through the clouds in a bright blue sky

INT MR PRENDERGHASTS HOUSE STUDY - NIGHT

PANTING and WHEEZING Mr Prenderghast staggers into his
study SLAMS the door behind him and heads for his desk

MR PRENDERGHAST
Ill show him and that scary
little fat kid
He shakily rummages around the collected papers and
trinkets and pulls out the leather bound book all the
time GRUMBLING crazily

MR PRENDERGHAST (CONTD)

Doesnt he realize were running

out of t

With a strangled CROAK he clutches dizzily at his chest
then keels over backwards stiffly hitting the floor with
a THUMP

Silence then a stream of spectral orbs sputter out of
him sculpting his shape in the air

With a GASP Mr Prenderghasts corpse sucks the spirit
back in and he staggers back to his feet

MR PRENDERGHAST (CONTD)

No Not yet Not yet

He CROAKS again this time for real CRASHING back down
onto the ground

The ghostly shape re-emerges from the body

He blinks his eyes looking around as if hes just been
woken from a deep sleep then down at the defunct body
lying at his feet

PRENDERGHAST GHOST
Aw nuts
ParaNorman 21

29 EXT SCHOOL - NIGHT 29

Lit by spotlights a large banner over the entrance
reads THE WITCHS CURSE - presented by BLITHE HOLLOW
MIDDLE SCHOOL DRAMA SOCIETY - written produced and
directed for the stage by Margot Henscher

A notice beneath it reads SPELLING BEE - NEXT WENSDAY
A chorus of kids voices can be heard SINGING from
inside belting out an operatic rendition of Donovans
Season of the Witch

30 30
INT SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - SAME

Rows of plastic chairs in front of the spotlit stage are
occupied by expectant families Among the sea of faintly
buzzing video cameras and a ripple of APPLAUSE Sandra
politely smiles at the acting talents of other peoples
children Next to her Perry struggles to fit a battery
into his camera

PERRY BABCOCK
Great now well never get to
remember this moment
ANGLE ON STAGE as Salma in full witch get-up waves her
hands theatrically at the other children
SALMA
I curse you accusers to die a
horrible and gruesome death and
rise from your graves as the
living dead your souls doomed to
an eternity of damnation
The Pilgrims who arent dying and rising from the dead
begin to menace Salma with their farming implements and
begin a slow ominous chant

KIDS
Kill the witch Kill the witch
Sandra nudges her husband and cheerily points toward the
stage

SANDRA BABCOCK
Gosh arent they adorable
Norman hears a HOOTING sound from above An owl with big
glowing eyes wheels down over the audience from the beams
of the gymnasium
Norman glances around wondering why no one else seems to
notice as it glides low and alights in the papier mache
branches on Neils head It turns to Norman and HOOTS
ParaNorman 22

30 30
He looks down from it and catches Neils eye Neil makes
a puzzled expression

NEIL
What

KIDS

Kill the witch Kill the witch

The chanting seems to deepen and slur and the air grows
dark and thick The shapes of the audience and the kids
beside him swim around blurring like a finger pulled
through oil paint The ceiling disintegrates into clouds
which CRACKLE with lightning

NORMAN

(under his breath)

Oh no Not again

All around trees have sprouted out of nowhere and
through the darkness in the distance are occasional
lights of small houses This might be how this very spot
looked three centuries ago

31 31
EXT OLD FOREST - NIGHT

As Norman turns on the spot GASPING he hears a RUSTLE in
the bushes behind him and spots several dark and ominous
figures in Pilgrim clothing scouring the undergrowth

PURITAN
Witch We know youre out there
Norman stands on a twig which naturally CRACKS loudly
and the figure turns around and points at him

PURITAN (CONTD)

There

NORMAN
No

PURITAN
Witch

More figures emerge from out of the darkness wielding
hayforks They SHOUT threateningly and as one man surge
toward him Norman turns and runs

The trees around him are shifting but theres no wind
blowing the branches Limbs GROAN as they twist bearing
down on him like ragged talons trying to stop his escape
Soon he can run no further the way ahead tangled up into
a wall of thorny fingers

Norman finds himself pushed up against the trunk of a
huge tree and a knothole grimaces at him wood splitting
open into a hag-like mouth It furrows a mossy brow and
speaks in a low rumbling voice

TREE
The dead are coming
Norman GASPS and tries to push himself away but the
pursuing figures are drawing closer and theres no
escape
A familiar voice whispers out of nowhere

NEIL (0S)

Hey buddy Are you okay

Norman turns around to find the knothole is now Neils
face bulging out of the side of the tree with a look of
concern This is the last straw and Norman SCREAMS

INT SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

Norman stands next to Neil on stage eyes closed and
WAILING Everyone around him stares in stunned silence
as still SCREAMING he runs into the spotlight

NORMAN

THE DEAD ARE COMING

He continues running directly off the edge of the stage
and lands on the floor with a THUMP

For a moment no one knows quite how to react Mrs
Henscher quizzically checks her script

Normans eyes focus and he sees everyone standing around
him staring Sandra pushes through the crowd

SANDRA BABCOCK
Norman

MITCH
Did he say the dead are coming

PERRY BABCOCK

(NERVOUS LAUGHING)
No no no

NORMAN

YES
Everyone jumps as Norman abruptly sits up eyes wild

NORMAN (CONTD)

ParaNorman 24

Perrys face drains of color while the other parents
MURMUR and MUTTER crowd speak for what a weirdo
Norman sees their expressions of disgust and suspicion
Worst of all peering around parents legs with a look of
shock and fear is Neil Norman catches his eye a moment
and Neil looks down at the ground

33 33
INT STATION WAGON - LATER

Barely keeping his fury in check Perry drives home
Norman sitting despondently in the back seat

PERRY BABCOCK

thing being a mental case in front
of your family but not the whole

be any more talking to ghosts or
grandmas or or what is it

PERRY BABCOCK

Perry pulls the car up in the Babcocks drive and gruffly
climbs out of the car

NORMAN

This is ridiculous I wish

everyone could see what I see I

didnt ask to be born this way

Perry mutters as he slams his door shut

fq

PERRY BABCOCK
Funny neither did we
Norman catches the remark and feels it hard in his gut
His mother hears it too and leans over her seat with a
look of sympathy
A beat as she sees the pain in her sons face

SANDRA BABCOCK
Yknow sometimes people say
things that seem mean but they do
it because theyre afraid

NORMAN
Hes my dad He shouldnt be
afraid of me
ParaNorman 25

to prepare himself for what he knows is going to be a bad
day He steels himself and SIGHS

INT SCHOOL BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

36 36
An overhead bulb casts a dim light over chipped wall
tiles and yellowed ceramic sinks with leaky faucets
The door opens and Norman hurries inside a number of
voices still SHOUTING behind him He shuts the door
cutting them off and leans against it taking a breath
He heads over to the first stall The door is locked so
he takes the next one
CLOSE ON Alvin sitting on the toilet in the next stall
scribbling obscenities on the wall to pass the time He
pauses as he hears the lid drop next door then resumes
his vandalism
Norman sits on the lid of the toilet pulling his knees
up under his chin feeling sorry for himself
ParaNorman 26

36 36
ANGLE ON toilet paper in an industrial-sized roll It
jitters on its mount and begins to turn slowly on its
own unspooling sheet by sheet toward the floor Norman
frowns and watches as it stops unravelling and a draught
of wind blows out of nowhere ruffling his hair

The toilet roll suddenly spins violently flinging the
paper into the air in reams The screws holding the
dispenser to the wall RATTLE fiercely

The toilet underneath Norman begins to shake and shudder
spilling water over the floor Norman WAILS loudly as he
jumps onto the back of the cistern

Alvin is frozen in place in his stall hearing the noises
and really not sure how to react to them He glances down
and sees toilet water leaking across the tiles

He quickly pulls up his pants to cover his dignity and
jumps up off the toilet with a SQUEAL

n Normans stall everything stops dead and the lid of
the toilet slowly CREAKS open

Norman GASPS as Mr Prenderghasts face stares up at him
out of the toilet bowl With some effort the old mans
ghost shimmies out of the toilet eventually POPPING out
like a cork from a bottle hovering in the air in front
of Normans face

NORMAN
You died

PRENDERGHAST GHOST
Yeah but I got unfinished
business here

NORMAN
Ew Couldnt you use another
stall

PRENDERGHAST GHOST
My ghost isnt going anywhere
until I pass on my duty to
another And that would be you

NORMAN
Me No you must have it wrong

PRENDERGHAST GHOST
Oh its you all right Ive been
holding back the witchs curse for
years but now Im dead It has to
be you

NORMAN
But I I dont know what any of
it means
ParaNorman 27
36 36
Before Normans eyes the bathroom stall and everything
beyond it is ripped away revealing thick undergrowth and
tall trees Norman is suddenly sat on the toilet in the
middle of a forest

PRENDERGHAST GHOST
It means the past is coming back
to haunt you Time is running out
The anniversary of the witchs
death is tonight Her ghost is
going to wake up and when she
does shell raise the dead You
gotta keep her in her grave
The toilet paper on the ground twists up beneath Normans
feet sculpting skull faces and clutching hands that
reach for him as he shrinks back

NORMAN
But Im just a kid How am I
supposed to stop it
In an instant the air and trees around him are eaten
away the school bathroom reappearing through the holes

PRENDERGHAST GHOST
Read from the book at the spot the
witch was buried

NORMAN
What book

PRENDERGHAST GHOST
The one in my hands
Norman looks at the ghosts wispy hands

PRENDERGHAST GHOST (CONTD)

Not these hands my other hands

The me thats at home in my study

starting to smell a little funny

Norman looks sick and overwhelmed but the ghost doesnt
let up swirling right up to his face

PRENDERGHAST GHOST (CONTD)
Get the book and read from it
Before the sun sets tonight

NORMAN
But this is crazy

PRENDERGHAST GHOST
Do I look crazy to you
Norman pauses a beat Mr Prenderghast is floating upside
down various bits of bathroom detritus orbiting around
him A piece of toilet paper dangles off his nose
ParaNorman 28

36 36

PRENDERGHAST GHOST (CONTD)
Tell me youll do this

NORMAN

PRENDERGHAST GHOST
Swear

NORMAN
Y-you mean like the f word

PRENDERGHAST GHOST
I mean promise

NORMAN
Okay okay I promise

PRENDERGHAST GHOST
Thatll do
Mr Prenderghasts ghost begins to disappear bubbling and
melting at the edges like a burning photograph

NORMAN
No Mr Prenderghast wait
Alvin hearing only Normans voice gingerly peeks around
the corner of his stall

PRENDERGHAST GHOST
Sorry kid Im done here Im
free Im finally free

NORMAN
Wait No you cant leave now
Please I dont understand
Mr Prenderghast hangs in the air a moment face scrunched
up as he awaits his release CACKLING crazily
The ghost explodes into a million particles of light
blowing open the stall door and catapulting Alvin
backwards across the room The mirrors behind him crack
and the light bulb shatters
From the floor Alvin groggily looks up and sees Norman
framed in the stall with the door hanging off its hinges
He reaches over and flushes the toilet

NORMAN (CONTD)
Uh yeah You might want to give
that a few minutes
He grabs his bag and runs out of the room
ParaNorman 29

INT BABCOCKS HOUSE NORMANS BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING

Norman paces his room looking pale and anxious as he
hears the front door shut downstairs Everywhere he turns
he finds himself face to face with some zombie related
novelty from his lurid horror posters to his shelves of
ghoulish action figures and its not doing anything for
his nerves

His cell phone BEEPS from his pocket giving him a start
He takes it out and reads a text COME TO THE WINDOW
Norman cautiously walks over and peers around the edge of
the window frame

A figure stands motionless in the yard below sheets of
laundry billowing off the clothes line beside it It
stares up at Norman through the blank eye holes of a
hockey mask

Norman GASPS and jumps back

With a frown he re-emerges and opens the window

The figure lifts the mask and Neil beams out from
underneath waving excitedly

NEIL
You wanna play some hockey
Norman SIGHS

NORMAN
Ive kinda got other things on my
mind right now
Neil looks a little uncomfortable

NEIL
Is it all that walking dead stuff
again

NORMAN
Mr Prenderghast appeared to me in
the bathroom

NEIL
Ew
ParaNorman 31

42 42

NORMAN
No his spirit He says the
witchs curse is real and I have
to go up to the old graveyard to
stop it Before the sun sets
tonight

Neil shifts uneasily as he processes

NEIL
So you wanna come play a bit
later

NORMAN
Didnt you hear what I just said

NEIL
Yeah but I thought my idea was
less likely to get us eaten

Norman knows hes on his own in this

NORMAN
Just go home Neil Im better off
on my own anyway

NEIL
But

NORMAN
Go home

Norman reaches up and closes the window

Neils shoulders
sag and he turns away

Across the room his Grandma materializes and squints
her eyes through the window as Neil awkwardly pulls
himself over the garden fence

GRANDMA BABCOCK
Jeez who rattled your chains

NORMAN
No one
Norman isnt in the mood for any more discussion

NORMAN (CONTD)
Dad says Im not supposed to talk
to you any more Grandma

GRANDMA BABCOCK
Jackass If I were a poltergeist
Id throw something at his head
Yknow by rights Im supposed to
be frolicking in paradise with
your grandfather but Im not
ParaNorman 32

Norman looks up as she drifts closer to the bed

NORMAN
So why did you stay

GRANDMA BABCOCK
I was never one for frolicking
Ill bet theres no cable or
canasta up there either Besides
I promised Id always look out for
you
She smiles floating in a sitting position at the end of
Normans bed She bobs gently like a balloon Fora
second this seems to comfort Norman but then another
thought crosses his mind

NORMAN
So its your duty

GRANDMA BABCOCK
In a manner of speaking

NORMAN
And youd do it no matter what

GRANDMA BABCOCK
Of course
NORMAN
Even if it was something really
scary
Grandma eyes him curiously

GRANDMA BABCOCK
Theres nothing wrong with being
scared Norman so long as you
dont let it change who you are
Norman thinks this over then smiles up at her again She
goes to rub his head affectionately but her ghost hand
just passes right through his spiky hair
She gives him a wink and drifts away through the wall
He is still scared but now determined too He steels
himself and grabs his jacket from his bed

Pug who have laid out a breakdancing mat and a beatbox
and are doing their best to impress Alvin imagines he is
wowing the girls with his krumping his ham-like limbs
flying around and Pug hollering support but in truth
they watch in morbid fascination

A faint CLATTERING sound down the road grows louder
Norman suddenly THUNDERS past them on his bike spinning
Alvin on the spot and knocking him onto his butt

Show over Alvin blunders to his feet his eyes following
Normans trajectory up the dark road and GROWLS

46 EXT WOODED LANE MR PRENDERGHASTS HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

Tall conifers rise up high on either side of the road
now little more than a dirt track Norman pedals up the
hill and swerves skidding to a stop in the gravel

He climbs off the bike eyes fixed on a ramshackle house
partially hidden in the foliage its porch door swinging
and CREAKING eerily in the breeze

He cautiously advances past a crooked mailbox on which is
written PRENDERGHAST and steps onto the wooden porch
ParaNorman 34

The fading light of day spills across the floorboards and
faded wallpaper of a long passage

NORMAN
Hello Mr Prenderghast
Motes of dust float around Norman as he moves slowly
toward a door slightly ajar muttering to himself

He quietly makes his way past all manner of objects that
epitomize the state of Mr Prenderghasts mind a
mannequin in a shopping cart a pile of broken
typewriters a suspended bag of spoons a closet full of
identically soiled hobo suits a Nordic track

48 48
INT PRENDERGHASTS HOUSE STUDY - CONTINUOUS

The study is filled with teetering piles of junk and old
furniture draped over in dust sheets A crucifix hangs
over a metal cot with rumpled bedding This is evidently
where the old man lived his whole life Starlight froma
window picks out a macabre halo on a shape on the floor
Mr Prenderghast dead where he fell tightly clutching a
leather-bound book

CLOSE ON Normans face as he swallows nervously and steps
closer to the body He gingerly takes hold of the book
and gives a gentle tug It holds fast in the rigor mortis
grasp He tugs harder shaking the book repeatedly the
corpse shaking with it

NORMAN
Let go
Norman spends several strenuous moments dragging the body
across the floorboards Mr Prenderghasts head glancing
off table legs and smacking repeatedly against the
floorboards as Norman tries to wrestle the book free
With a final yank the book pulls loose and GASPING
Norman grips the book to his chest and runs to the door

Norman careens through the door leaps off the porch and

sprints along the wooded lane up the hill watched by
Alvin concealed behind some bushes

EXT WOODED HILLTOP OLD CHAPEL GRAVEYARD - LATER

Norman emerges from the woods his long shadow preceding
him as the sun begins its descent behind the tall trees
ParaNorman 35

50 50
He pauses and stares out across weathered tombstones
poking out amidst tangles of thorns
Clutching the book tight Norman wrenches open the heavy
gate its rusted padlock crumbling apart
Eventually the track runs up to a stone slab surrounded
on either side by thick bramble Norman brushes aside
vines and reads an epitaph engraved into the stone

HERE LIES BURIED THE SEVEN VICTIMS OF THE BLITHE HOLLOW
CURSE MAY YOUR SOULS FIND EVENTUAL AND EVERLASTING

SALVATION 1712

Norman pushes through the thick bushes into a secluded
plot of land behind the slab with seven gravestones
sticking out from the undergrowth

NORMAN
This is it
The sun continues its descent casting an ever
lengthening shadow of treetops across the graveyard

NORMAN (CONTD)
Read from the book stop the
curse go home and pretend this
never happened
Norman steels himself opens the book and starts to read

NORMAN (CONTD)
Once upon a time in a far-off
land there lived a king and queen
in a magnificent castle
He pauses confused by what hes reading

NORMAN (CONTD)
What A fairy tale
A hand reaches over his shoulder from nowhere whipping
the book out of his grasp He spins around to find Alvin
standing behind him

ALVIN
What ya got there Geekula
Norman launches himself at the book but Alvin holds him
back at arms length

NORMAN
Give it back
ALVIN
Cant wait to see everybodys
faces when they hear about this
one
ParaNorman 36

NORMAN
No dont Alvin

ALVIN

You got nothin to say

NORMAN
Uh-oh

ALVIN
Dang straight uh-oh Thats what
happens when Alvin gets around
here Uh-oh is that Alvin Uh-oh
Alvins gonna make me run home to
mommy
As Norman twists and wrestles against the bully the
turbulent clouds in the sky above them twist and coalesce
into the vague semblance of a huge grinning face The
face of a witch
There is an enormous RUMBLE and a flash of lightning
silhouettes the boys

ALVIN (CONTD)
Uh-oh What is that
The wind has picked up HOWLING through the gravestones
Norman looks at the face leering out of the clouds

NORMAN
Its her
Another violent CRACK of thunder and flash of light and
the wind instantly cuts out The boys stand stock still
Reaching down like a colossal arm a great plume of cloud
spirals over the cemetery enveloping the tumbledown
chapel and seeping around the gravestones Fingers of
murky fog slither across the ground occasionally pausing
and hanging in the air as though sniffing it There is
something eerily playful in the movement of the tendrils
The boys are jolted as an awful high pitched SCREAM blows
through the graveyard like a shockwave pulsing through
the fog like a heartbeat
Norman and Alvin cover their ears and cower as the fog
suddenly rears up like a claw and fiercely gouges into
the earth in front of the boys

ParaNorman 37

50 50
Silence then the ground begins to RUMBLE beneath their
feet and ripples beneath the tombstones Stone slabs
GRIND and shift One CRACKS right through the center

ALVIN
Whats that sound
Norman watches horrified as the wet earth atop one of
the graves splits and a skeletal hand bursts through
Norman watches as more graves bulge and break open and
mud-encrusted shapes begin to emerge through the earth
The air is filled with anguished MOANING the glowing fog
dancing and whirling about the hatching figures
The two boys are rooted to the spot mouths hanging open
CLOSE ON one of the figures crawling out of the ground
into a patch of moonlight Ragged and rotten it wears the
mud-encrusted clothes of a colonial Puritan It stares
down at its hands almost in disbelief then lifts its
face up to the sky and lets out a HOWL
Thunder that sounds like deep and abysmal LAUGHTER echoes
through the turbulent clouds
The boys find themselves backed up against another
headstone this one engraved with the name JUDGE
HOPKINS They leap aside as the ground swells beneath
their feet and the DEAD JUDGE punches through the dirt
bolt upright His face wears a rictus grin and he looms
over the boys like the Grim Reaper in a powdered wig
He tilts his head curiously when he sees the book in
Alvins hand and HISSES through yellowed teeth
Norman makes a last ditch attempt at reading the book as
the Dead Judge approaches the other zombies gathering
behind him

NORMAN
Once upon a time in a far-off
Once upon a Ina

ALVIN

Make it stop right now please

NORMAN
Its not working
The Dead Judge gives a hideous GROWL but Norman frowns
confused because he can hear words

DEAD JUDGE
STOP YOU MUST STOP
ParaNorman 38

50 50

ALVIN

think I peed my pants
Survival instincts finally kick in and Alvin makes a run
for it scrambling through the graves toward the gate

He told me to read from the book
to stop the curse I thought it
was a spell or something but
Norman narrows his eyes as he sees Mr Prenderghasts
desk still strewn with pictures and newspaper clippings
He hurries over and begins rummaging through the mess
scattering papers across the floor

CLOSE ON the door knob RATTLING furiously then a CRACK
as a mottled hand punches it right through the wood

A figure limps slowly into the hallway dragging one
crippled foot behind the other It stops halfway along
and tilts its head as if listening and emits a dire
MOAN More shapes appear behind it in the doorway and fan
out along the hallway

INT MR PRENDERGHASTS HOUSE STUDY - CONTINUOUS
The boys tremble in their hiding places trying not to
make a sound Alvin crouched behind a stack of books and
Norman lying underneath the bed The footsteps grow
louder as the zombies shuffle into the room

NORMANS POV - rotten legs step up to Mr Prenderghasts
body lying where he fell on the floorboards Two
withered feet suddenly step right up to the bed
Something drops onto the floor inches in front of
Normans face with an unpleasant SLAP Normans eyes bug
out as he realizes it is a zombies dislodged ear A
weltered arm reaches down to grope around for the body
part until Norman pushes the ear as carefully as he can
manage back into the zombies fingers The hand retreats
back out from under the bed

There is a loud SCREAM as Alvin unable to contain
himself any longer jumps out from his hiding place and
makes for the door The corpses look up as he disappears
down the hall then stagger after him

Norman takes this chance to follow but the Dead Judge
blocks his exit They both stand quite still staring
into each others eyes The corpse tilts its head almost
quizzically and its eyes widen as it notices the book
under his arm

Norman steps sideways to run past it but the corpse does
too Both it and Norman step one way then the other and
back again Norman feigns one direction and quickly bolts
in the other past the corpse and out the door

Mitch drives along dark roads Neil sits behind him
looking bemused while Courtney in the front passenger
seat extols her life history

COURTNEY
And she said I could totally
consider a career in formation
swimming But I was like I wanna
do something that helps people
less fortunate than me thank you

Neil lies back in his seat eyes rolling

NEIL
Kill me now

COURTNEY
Thank you for doing this Mitch He
means an awful lot to me I love
him like he was a brother

Courtney counters the backseat barbs by smiling demurely
but Mitchs attention has been drawn by something else

MITCH
Whoa Look at that sky

The wooded hill rises steeply a few miles in front of
them and at its top is the old chapel Pressing down

Running down the middle of the road blinded by the glare
of the vans headlights are Alvin and Norman The van
swerves around them and grazes the trees the side mirror
flying off as it hits a branch

Mitch fights to control the van as Courtney SCREAMS

NEIL
That was Norman
Shaken Mitch realizes another figure is looming out of
the darkness in front of them He slams on the brakes
again but too late The tall dirty-looking figure stands
stock still as the van plows straight into him
Dust flies up from the wheels of the van as it skids to
an eventual stop in the center of the road

Mitch climbs out of the van and sees the figure lying
still on the moonlit road He nervously jogs over to it
As he gets closer Mitch can see the man more clearly He
is wrapped in filthy tattered clothing of a bygone era
and is covered in dirt Flies BUZZ around him

MITCH
Er hello sir
He hunkers down and is immediately hit by the stench A
mud-encrusted face stares up at him
ANGLE ON the van as Courtney leans her head out

COURTNEY
Is he dead or what

MITCH
I I dont know Hes not
moving
The figures head lets out a faint GASP

MITCH (CONTD)
Hes still breathing
Mitch reaches out to gently lift the figures head but as
he does there is a CRUNCH and it comes off in his hands

COURTNEY
So hes okay

MITCH
Uh not exactly

COURTNEY

What What did you just say
Mitch looks from the head back to the van then at the
head again He licks his lips nervously as he thinks

MITCH
Does anyone know CPR
Further down the road Norman runs back toward the van
Alvin still in tow He sees Mitch ahead of him getting
dizzily to his feet still holding the head

The head in Mitchs hands suddenly GASPS again opening
its mouth Mitch SHRIEKS as the headless figure on the

road sits up and reaches out its arms Mitch drop kicks
it like a football It flies WAILING into the bushes

As if struck by the same blow the rest of the corpse
staggers backwards
Alvin and Norman run past him toward the van bustling
past Courtney and clambering inside

Mitch leaps into the drivers seat beside her

A beat as the smoke clears The soot-covered zombies
SPLUTTER as they cough up whats left of their lungs
They turn from one to the other awaiting direction from
their leader But the Dead Judge is nowhere to be seen

A zombie points down the winding road where the woods
eventually thin out into leafy suburban drives The
ragged shape of the Judge is clinging to the back of the
van thrashing around and WAILING as it picks up speed
The zombies quietly watch until the van moves out of
sight behind the trees then turn their attention to the
lights of the town center below them They weigh up their
options and MOANING shuffle toward civilization

The arm frees itself from Neil and turns on Norman
leaping at him like a viper
Norman holds the book up as a shield and manages to swat
the zombie arm away flipping it across the front seat
where it lands on the back of Mitchs neck

Mitch SCREAMS as the rotten hand clamps down onto the top
of his head and madly tries to shake it off It hangs
onto him grimly bony fingers hooked around his nostrils
With Mitch no longer steering the van swerves crazily
across the road shaking the Dead Judge off the

She looks up from her garbage as the zombies approach
Her face is caked in a terrifying green avocado face

begins to ebb Alone in the archive room he slumps to
his knees feeling useless and frustrated

Something CLATTERS behind him and Norman hears someone
approaching

NORMAN

He turns around to face his friend and finds himself
staring up at a zombie moving toward him along the dark
aisle pale moonlight shining off its exposed bones
Norman GASPS
He realizes zombies are converging on him from all
directions barring his way out through the door The
Dead Judge GROANS as he approaches
Norman backs away clutching the book to his chest

The kids manage to pull back just as a burning bottle
flies over their heads SHATTERING glass It lands in the
middle of the room and a puddle of burning alcohol
spreads across the floorboards

Tendrils of black smoke are also beginning to creep under
the edge of the front door

The kids stand in a group terror-stricken as the smoke
thickens and flames begin to lick along the floor
Courtney is quick to lose what remains of her composure

Norman heaves himself through a tiny hatchway onto a flat
roof at the highest point of the building He shuts the
hatch inching away as the zombies beneath beat on it
with their hands

Norman finds himself backed up against a flimsy wooden
rail which CREAKS warningly He leans over and sees the
square beneath filled with angry people He has nowhere
left to run

Above him the red sky RUMBLES clouds churning into a
ghastly grinning mouth

Far below the gathered townsfolk grow increasingly
erratic A pair of visiting tourists happily take in
their surroundings with their cell phones and cameras
Sandra tugs at her husbands arm as they are buffeted by
the increasingly erratic townsfolk

Oh my gosh do you think this has
got anything to do with Norman
Perry waves her hand away irritably

PERRY BABCOCK
Of course not
He is interrupted by a SHOUT as someone sees Normans
tiny figure silhouetted against the raging sky on the
roof of the building

LIBRARIAN
Everyone look
Perry and Sandra see their son begin gesticulating wildly
at the clouds

SANDRA BABCOCK

Norman continues YELLING at the sky waving the book

He madly flicks through the pages attempting to read
aloud over the ROARING wind

NORMAN
Once upon a time in a far-off land
there lived a king and queen in

a magnificent castle
The horrible cloud face above him CACKLES monstrously
drowning out the story

NORMAN (CONTD)
Why wont you listen to me Why
are you doing this
The face in the clouds turns inside out as a tongue of
lightning spits out It SMACKS into the book held in
front of Normans chest lifts him up off his feet and
throws him back onto the old timbers of the roof
The air is knocked out of Norman as trailing smoke he
SMASHES through the wood into the fiery chasm of the
building beneath

INT TOWN HALL OLD COURTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Norman lies on the floor shifting painfully With some
effort he sits up rubbing his head

The book in his hand is now a blackened cinder with a
large smoldering hole gouged through the middle

Norman realizes he is no longer inside the burning
building Around him indistinct shapes begin to pool into
clarity He is in the courthouse but three hundred years
ago and a trial is about to begin
A crowd of onlookers gather around a platform at the head
of the room where officious-looking gentlemen in austere
Puritan clothing stand around a table Two dour men in
black skull caps are seated an empty chair between them
Norman moves unnoticed through the crowd toward the
platform The hubbub of the townsfolk dies down

The imposing figure of Judge Hopkins tall and august
marches out of a side chamber steps up onto the wooden
dais and seats himself silently between his solemn peers
He glares down at Norman with cold humorless eyes

JUDGE HOPKINS
Agatha Prenderghast of his
Majestys Province of
Massachusetts
As the Judges voice continues Norman sees played out
against it a MONTAGE of the preceding court case
The notary stands up waving a wad of testimonies

JUDGE HOPKINS (VO) (CONTD)

arraigned for the horrible crime

of witchcraft

A pale woman fiddles nervously with the ribbon on her
bonnet as she is questioned by the Judge

testimonies have been heard

A wiry woman with a pinched face gestures fearfully with
her arms as she recounts her evidence

You have by this court been
found guilty

A young farmhand bows his head shamefully as he adds
further ammunition to the prosecution

JUDGE HOPKINS (V0O)

according to your grievous

crimes

Another village woman SOBS into a handkerchief as she
tells her story

QUICK CUTS of the accusers one after the other as the
Judge finishes his verdict The notary the preacher the

Camera swings slowly around Norman to reveal AGGIE
PRENDERGHAST standing in chains right behind him

AGGIE
No
Norman reacts with horror The witch cowering next to
him is no more than eleven years-old Her long hair is
unkempt and dirt on her face is streaked with tears from
her eyes Her manacles have been specially made to fit
her tiny wrists and weigh her to the floor She SNIFFS
scared and confused

JUDGE HOPKINS
Do you have anything to say for
yourself

AGGIE
I was only playing

JUDGE HOPKINS
Aye with fire You were speaking
with the dead
The crowd GASPS and MURMURS fearfully

JUDGE HOPKINS (CONTD)

You are to be taken to the place

of execution where you will be

Norman shouts out but no one can hear or see him
NORMAN
Wait No You cant do this
The grim-faced Sheriff moves toward Norman and Aggie She
backs away tears flowing down her face

AGGIE
I didnt do anything wrong
A terrible panic comes over her face

AGGIE (CONTD)
Stop Leave me alone or Ill make
you sorry Ill make all of you
sorry
Norman feels unsteady on his feet the room seeming to
spin around him The faces of the townsfolk pale and
skull-like swirl around and around blurring together
In the center of it all glowing like a bonfire Aggie

SCREAMS
The world turns black and Norman collapses in a faint

INT TOWN HALL ARCHIVES - CONTINUOUS

NORMANS POV - the high timbers of the hall roof swim
into focus and then faces peering down at him Skeletal
rotting faces The dead Puritans are standing around him
in a half-circle He sits up terrified and looks around
shuffling back across the floorboards on his bottom The
dead villagers stand where they are staring intently

Norman sits a moment heart pounding WHISPERING SHAKILY

NORMAN
How could you She was just a
little kid She was no different
than me
The Dead Judge takes a step forward

NORMAN (CONTD)
Keep away from me
The Dead Judge stops then opens his horrible mouth and
speaks in a guttural voice
ParaNorman 74

127 127

DEAD JUDGE
You must stop the
curse
A beat Norman is stunned

NORMAN
What You dont want to kill me
The Judge shakes his head and points down at the book
beside Normans feet

DEAD JUDGE
You can speak to the dead To us
To her We need you to read from
the book to send us all back to
the grave

NORMAN
But it didnt work Its a fairy
tale Just a bedtime story

He narrows his eyes at the Judge

NORMAN (CONTD)
Thats it isnt it A bedtime
story to keep a little girl asleep
for another year And now you need
my help because Im the only one
who can read it to her
He bends down to pick it up His eyes flash angrily at
the zombies and he hurls the burnt book at the Judge It
hits him in the chest and falls to his feet with a THUD

NORMAN (CONTD)

Heres your book Try reading it

yourself

The zombies stare down at the blackened lump of charred
paper and several of them GASP The Dead Judges eyes
are filled with fear and desperation

NORMAN (CONTD)
Why did you do it

DEAD JUDGE
We were scared

NORMAN
Of what

DEAD JUDGE
Of her

Norman looks at the book of fairy tales lying at his
feet Its pages are curled and blackened embers still
glowing around the hole blown right through it

NORMAN
Every year someone reads the story
at her grave Before me it was Mr
Prenderghast and before him there
were others but the curse doesnt
ever go away Nothing gets better
Its not enough
Norman looks at it a moment thinking He knows what he
has to do

INT TOWN HALL - CONTINUOUS

Smeared with soot and COUGHING the kids are trapped in
the lobby They cower together as burning wood CREAKS and
CRACKS all around them The air is grey and caustic and
filled with flakes of charcoal and burning ash

A burning timber GROANS as it splits from the ceiling and
tumbles toward the children They SCREAM and scatter as
it hits the floorboards in a shower of glowing sparks
Mitch shouts out from beside a heavy wooden counter top

MITCH
Guys Guys Under here Under

The kids scramble beneath the shelter of the counter as
more glowing embers rain down around them
Courtney grabs Mitch by the bicep and whispers weakly

COURTNEY

might be the last chance I get to
tell you how I feel
ParaNorman 76

128 128

MITCH
Uh well no Unless we get
brought back as zombies and then
technically youll have longer
Courtney opens her mouth to continue but her love train
is thoroughly derailed by the nearby CRASH of breaking
wood and the archive door beside them CLATTERS to the
ground
The cowering kids all watch in silent horror as several
dark figures limp and shamble out of the smoke and make
their way past them across the room Its the zombies
and theyre being led by Norman

COURTNEY
Norman

NORMAN
Come on This way

COURTNEY
Youve gotta be kidding me
Norman his mouth shielded by his sleeve heads
purposefully toward the front doors

EXT TOWN HALL - MOMENTS LATER

A loud THUD from within the Town Hall causes the gathered
crowd outside to GASP and those closest to the doors to
take a few steps back

The crowd GASPS again as the charred front door of the
Town Hall is wrenched off its hinges by a huge piece of
timber and CRASHES down the steps in a shower of flaming
splinters

A ripple of shock runs through the crowd as a number of
skeletal figures emerge SPLUTTERING and WHEEZING through
the smoke shielding their faces from the heat

The gathered crowd are even more aghast when they realize
a child is being guided out of the flames by the zombies
Unseen by the crowd Courtney and the other kids crawl to
the splintered opening of the front door blinking and
COUGHING for air

Hooper pulls out her gun and marches toward the zombies

SHERIFF HOOPER

You stay right where you are You
may be dead already but I will
still shoot you

ParaNorman 77

The zombies stop on the steps burning building behind
them and the hostile townsfolk in front of them Norman
pushes through and stands firmly in the way of Hoopers
gun arms spread defensively

Courtney and the other kids GASP as they watch from
within the doorway

SANDRA BABCOCK

PERRY BABCOCK
Ill come back and haunt Norman
Maybe then hell start listening

NORMAN
No You dont understand whats

Courtney edges forward out of the doorway shocked but
transfixed
NORMAN (CONTD)
The curse isnt about the zombies
hurting you Its about you
hurting them I figured it out
and I know a way to stop this

A few members of the crowd try to push past Perry toward
the steps

Can you stop being a mob for just
one minute

NORMAN

Punctuating every shout the roiling clouds continue to
RUMBLE their horrible laughter

fashion Neil Mitch and Alvin step forward too creating
a barrier all around him all joining hands in
solidarity
CLOSE ON Courtneys face as she hisses sidelong to Alvin

COURTNEY (CONTD)

A ripple of confusion seems to run through the crowd

COURTNEY (CONTD)

rumbling clouds have gone quiet

CRYSTAL
So theyre not going to hurt us

NORMAN
No does it look like any of them
are trying to hurt you Theyre
just people At least they used to
be Just stupid people who should
have known better
Norman looks at the line of Puritans They look quite sad
and pathetic really Hardly monstrous at all

NORMAN (CONTD)
They did something unforgivable
because they were scared and they
were cursed for it Now its
happening all over again Dont
you get it They were just like
you But now it has to stop For
good
Across the crowd weapons are being lowered and faces are
starting to look a little guilty
There is silence as the modern townsfolk stare at the
line of three hundred year-old townsfolk Throughout the
crowd various weapons CLATTER as they hit the ground
A small girl tiptoes up the steps and silently offers one
of the zombies his arm back

The quiet is shattered by a deafening SCREAM It blows
out of the storm clouds and whips through the plaza ona
hellish wind The street lamps around the square shatter
in bursts of sparks raining down on the amassed people
The sky above is blood red clouds twisting and
contorting into a vast unnatural vortex

The Town Hall erupts in a fireball tongues of white fire
ROARING out of the embers as the ground shakes and the
crowd scatters in terror

Neil turns to Norman as they duck for cover behind a
parked car and SHOUTS over the noise of the wind

lifted up into the air by the supernatural wind It
CRASHES down at the foot of the Town Hall steps
shattering into a hundred pieces of rubble
-Windows blow out of tacky tourist stores their cheap
front displays ripped apart by the wind
-A bolt of lightning tears through the huge billboard in
the plaza ripping apart the idealized image of the
towns history in a spiral of splintered wood
Norman struggles over to where a group of townsfolk and
zombies cower from the destruction Sandra runs over to
her son and hugs him

After a moment the Judge lets out a sepulchral MOAN

NORMAN
He says take a left here
Perry gives a distasteful look but turns the steering
wheel He peers out through the raging storm windscreen
wiper batting ineffectively at the onslaught of debris

PERRY BABCOCK
Weve already been this way Were
going around in circles

SANDRA BABCOCK
Maybe we should pull over and ask
someone

PERRY BABCOCK
Oh right you think maybe we
should stop at a graveyard and dig
up some other eighteenth-century
corpses

he headlights of the car illuminate a huge fallen trunk
head along the path and Perry pulls the car to a stop

So why are we here

NORMAN
Someones gotta talk to her Dad

PERRY BABCOCK
Yeah um whys that person you
exactly
As they continue the surrounding trees press in on them
just like in Normans vision Branches and thorns lash at
their faces while thick roots entangle their feet
Normans family are falling behind and realize too late
that the encroaching trees are about to crush Norman

SANDRA BABCOCK
Oh my goodness look out

NORMAN
Mom

SANDRA BABCOCK
Perry Do something
Perry is finding it difficult to move a tree bears down
on him its roots snagging his thrashing limbs

PERRY BABCOCK

together blocking off the way ahead with gnarled wood
Sandra struggles free and shouts over the branches

on his own Ahead of him a phosphorescent glow shines off
the trees and he knows he is very close

EXT OLD FOREST CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

Exhausted but determined Norman finds the source of the
supernatural storm a clearing sculpted out of the forest
by Aggies fury

In the center of it all is the tree bleached white as
bone and grotesquely twisted The trees around it CREAK
and GROAN as though theyd like to uproot and plant
themselves someplace else

Beneath this tree lie Aggies remains buried three
hundred years ago Now a mess of roots and rocks open out
like an ugly wound and within them a tiny childlike
figure is barely visible through a spitting furnace of
spectral energy Ectoplasm rages up around the trees
finger-like branches like a mushroom cloud of negative
energy Its a childs tantrum turned atomic

NORMAN
Hello
Words echo around him in response

AGGIE
Youre not welcome here Go away
Norman shivers as the voice RUMBLES coldly
The raging wind intensifies as Norman turns back around

NORMAN
Uh I really need to speak with
you

AGGIE
Who are you

NORMAN

Im Norman Norman Babcock You

dont actually know me but I know

you Were actually kind of the

same you and I

Norman takes another step closer ducking as petrified
branches and rocks fly over his head on the wind
ParaNorman 85

140 140

AGGIE
Youre not dead

NORMAN
Well no apart from that

AGGIE
And youre a boy

NORMAN
Well yes that too

AGGIE
Youre not like me at all
Norman hesitates knowing hes on dangerous ground

NORMAN
Well I know how you feel

AGGIE
No you dont You dont know
anything about me

NORMAN
I know your name is Agatha
Prenderghast
The ghostly voice wavers for the first time

AGGIE
What

NORMAN
And I know youre probably tired
Right Because I mean its
really late and its been a long
night and were like only eleven
years-old and
The voice snaps back like a clap of thunder

AGGIE
I dont want to go to sleep and
you cant make me I burnt the
book into dust and now I dont
have to listen to that stupid
story any more Leave me alone
Norman is terrified but advances on the tree the rocks
under his feet churning

NORMAN
No Im not leaving Just listen
to me
(takes a breath)
Uh once upon a time long
ago there was a little girl
ParaNorman 86
140 140

AGGIE
What

NORMAN
A little girl who was different
from the other people in her
village
The voice chants petulantly over him as if putting its
demonic fingers in its ears

AGGIE
Im not listening LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-

LAAA

NORMAN
She could see and do things that
no one could understand and that
made them scared of her

AGGIE
I dont like this story

NORMAN
She turned away from everyone and
became sad and lonely and had no
one to turn to

AGGIE
Stop it
If Aggie werent floating three feet above the ground
shed be stamping her feet Her voice blows bits of bark
off the surrounding trees

NORMAN

But the more she turned away from

people the more scared they were

of her and they did something

terrible

Arcs of white energy CRACKLE through the air Where they
hit the ground they send up white flames

NORMAN (CONTD)
They became so scared that they
took her away and killed her

AGGIE
No

NORMAN
But even though she was dead
something in her came back

AGGIE
Stop
ParaNorman 87

140 140

NORMAN
And this part of her wouldnt go
away not for three hundred
years

AGGIE
Shut up

NORMAN
And the longer it stayed the less
there was of the little girl

AGGIE
Ill make you suffer

NORMAN
Why
Aggie goes to shout but stops unsure of her answer

AGGIE
Because because

NORMAN
Because you want everyone to hurt
just as much as you are So
whenever you wake up you play this
mean game but you dont play
fair

AGGIE
They hurt me

NORMAN
So you hurt them back

AGGIE
I wanted everyone to see how
rotten they were

NORMAN
Youre just like them Agatha

AGGIE
No Im not

NORMAN
Youre a bully

AGGIE
No Im not
Norman has almost reached the eye of the storm The world
behind him is a whirling torrent of burning white chaos

NORMAN
They did something awful but that
doesnt mean you should too

NORMAN (CONTD)
All thats left of you now is mean
and horrible
He sees her clearly now True she is floating above the
ground and her hair is writhing madly about her and
plumes of spectral fire are pouring off her body but
shes still just a little girl underneath

AGGIE

Thats not true

Norman climbs up a tree root Aggies flames searing his
skin and clothes as he gets close enough to touch her

NORMAN

hen stop This is wrong and you
now it Youve spent so long
remembering the bad people that
youve forgotten the good ones
There must have been someone who
loved you and cared for you You
dont remember them

-

AGGIE

Leave me alone

NORMAN
But youre not alone You have to
remember

AGGIE
Keep away from me
Norman reaches the end of the root and jumps His
outstretched fingers shake madly as they approach Aggies
tiny hand as though the air is fighting against him

NORMAN
Remember
There is a flash of white and silence

FADE TO

EXT NEW FOREST CLEARING - BRIGHT SUNNY DAY

Dappled sunlight falls through shimmering leaves and
blossoms Norman and Aggie are standing in thick grass
replete with wild flowers the dead white tree now quite
alive and blossoming behind them

Aggie is no longer an indistinct specter but flesh and
blood and as real as Norman She stares down at her hand
as Norman holds it gently by the end of her finger

AGGIE
Aggie My name was Aggie
ParaNorman 89

141 141
A brightly-colored butterfly flutters between them Aggie
starts to remember as she follows its flight

AGGIE (CONTD)
I I remember my mommy brought
me here once We sat under the
tree and she told me stories They
all had happy endings

(BROW FURROWS)
And then those horrible men came
and took me away and I never saw
her again
She scowls angrily at the butterfly flitting past her
face It instantly crumples up into ashes Surprised she
GASPS and watches the blackened dust fall to the ground
Theres anger in Aggie but there is confusion sadness
and regret there too She isnt quite so scary anymore

NORMAN
Sometimes when people get scared
they say and do terrible things I
think you got so scared that you
forgot who you are But I dont
think youre a witch Not really
Aggie looks into his eyes

AGGIE
You dont

NORMAN
I think youre just a little kid
with a really special gift who
only ever wanted people to
understand her
He smiles softly

NORMAN (CONTD)
So were not all that different at
all

AGGIE
But what about the people who hurt
you Dont you ever want to make
them suffer
Norman thinks this over and shrugs

NORMAN
Well yeah but what good would
that do You think just because
theres bad people out there that
theres no good ones either I
thought the same thing

NORMAN (CONTD)
For a while But theres always
someone out there for you
Somewhere
Aggie frowns looking lost

AGGIE
just want my mommy

NORMAN
m sorry Aggie Shes gone

AGGIE
That story you were telling How
does it end

fq

NORMAN
think thats up to you

Aggie blinks through tears at the grass beneath her feet

AGGIE
Is this where they buried me

NORMAN
Its a pretty good place to sleep
Then you can be with your mom
again
Aggie holds Normans gaze then looks down to the ground
her tiny frame heaving with a last SOB She sits down on
the grass and curls up resting her head on her hands
Norman kneels down next to her as she closes her eyes
Her breathing grows deeper and more peaceful her tiny
frame shifting softly under her long hair
The air around them grows blurry and indistinct Aggie
softens as though out of focus and the whole world
becomes a swirling dance of glowing orbs Norman closes
his eyes as a blizzard of light engulfs him spiraling up
into the clouds high above his head
Lightning flashes white far above and thunder RUMBLES
softly through the sky as if moving away

EXT TOWN HALL - CONTINUOUS

The zombies form a group in the center of the square all
of them looking up into the clouds The people around
them stop and stare awestruck as a breeze buffets their
clothes and the air around them begins to shimmer

As the modern townsfolk watch on some of the zombies
take each others arms for support Those with eyelids
close them One by one their bodies dissolve away
leaving ethereal figures in their place

ParaNorman 91

143 143
For a moment they float where they stood ghostly
apparitions of the people they once were before the
curse They stare sadly out at their flesh and blood
descendents and in an instant become just specks of
light that are caught by the breeze and carried out of
sight

142 142

EXT OLD FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT
Norman blinks open his eyes taking a moment to survey
the scene around him

He sits upon the upturned root of the tree the earth
around broken and twisted a testament to what has
happened He looks up into the sky and gives a sad smile

NORMAN
Sleep tight
He clambers down through the roots back toward the path

144 144
EXT OLD FOREST TRAIL - CONTINUOUS

Norman wearily walks through the splintered roots to find
his family Sandra shouts out when she sees him

SANDRA BABCOCK
Norman Norman
Sandra runs over to him and scoops him up in her arms
hugging him tightly

SANDRA BABCOCK (CONTD)
My brave little man I thought I
was going to lose you

NORMAN
Mom youre embarrassing me

SANDRA BABCOCK
Thats my job

COURTNEY
Good job Norman
Perry takes a deep breath and looks at his son There is
relief and a hint of admiration in his eyes

PERRY BABCOCK
Well done Son You did it
The Judge stood some way behind them lets out a GROAN
and the Babcocks turn to look at him
ParaNorman 92

144 144
They watch in awe as the Judge begins to turn to dust
his ragged clothes and decayed body dissolving in the
rain For barely a moment a shimmering ghostly figure is
left behind an image of the man that once was The
spirit blinks sorrowful eyes then becomes nothing more
than a million glowing fragments dissipating on the
breeze

146B 146B
EXT NEW TOWN HALL - LATER

The sky has lost its lurid pall and the clouds are now
lighter and less menacing

In the Town Square clusters of townsfolk are trying to
come to terms with the nights events

Norman weaves through the crowd away from the Babcocks
station wagon searching for Neil He hears small
snippets of conversation as he goes

Dwayne waves his notebook under Hoopers nose

DEPUTY DWAYNE
So uh are we gonna need
statements
She slaps it out of his hand

DEPUTY DWAYNE (CONTD)

Ow That was my finger nail

Slob Guy Crystal and Mrs Henscher are convincing each
other of their excuses

MRS HENSCHER
You know what its like You join
a mob and you say things I was
merely inhabiting the role

SLOB GUY
Yeah it was the others They
pushed me into it
Norman smiles as he passes Alvin regaling a bunch of
teenagers

ALVIN
Yeah me and Norman are ina lot
of the same classes Pretty much
inseparable Best buds And we do
a lot of psychic investigations
together We have a blog actually

Nearby Courtney wastes no time cozying up to Mitch
ParaNorman 93

146B 146B

COURTNEY
So I was thinking maybe we could
catch a movie sometime Nothing
scary

MITCH
That sounds great Kathy Yknow
youre gonna love my boyfriend
Hes like a total chick-flick nut
Courtney stares at him at a loss for words then
successfully reads between the lines and turns away

MUTTERING

Norman eventually finds Neil sat upon the witch statues
broken plinth attempting to piece it back together
pebble by pebble

NORMAN
Hey Neil
He climbs up beside his friend who beams at him
gleefully

NEIL
You did it You stopped the
witchs curse and made the zombies
go away and saved pretty much
everything

NORMAN
I guess I just wanted to say
thanks You stood by me All the
time

NEIL
Yeah of course Dont get weird
or anything So you think now
everythings gonna turn back to
normal
Norman looks across the square The smoldering buildings
the fallen signposts the warped trees the rubble

NORMAN
As normal as it could be

INT BABCOCKS HOUSE LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Norman sits on the floor in front of the TV A news
report shows the wrecked Main Street with the headline
TOURIST TOWN HIT BY MYSTERY TORNADO

Perry enters the room and Norman quickly changes the
channel on the TV to a noisy monster movie
ParaNorman 94

PERRY BABCOCK

NORMAN
Hi Dad

PERRY BABCOCK

NORMAN

Norman looks around and sees his father and grandmother
sitting side by side on the sofa He nods

PERRY BABCOCK (CONTD)

Right Of course she is

Perry tries his best to maintain his composure and
wriggles a little in his seat

PERRY BABCOCK (CONTD)

Norman nods Perry hem-hems and turns awkwardly to face
her nose to ear She doesnt seem to notice

PERRY BABCOCK (CONTD)

Hi Mom

Perry tries to downplay his discomfort and turns back to
concentrate on the movie his son is watching

Sandra and Courtney enter from the kitchen carrying
snacks Sandra takes a seat on an armchair and Courtney
lies down on the floor beside her brother munching
popcorn They all settle in to watch the movie

A beat then Perry and Grandma speak at the same time

PERRY BABCOCK (CONTD) GRANDMA BABCOCK
So whats happening now So whats happening now
Norman sits as he is facing the TV and grins

THE END
