1 INT TOWNHOUSESTUDY - DAY 1

-EARLY APRIL 1841-
We are close on a PAIR OF BLACK HANDS as they open A

FINELY WRAPPED PACKET OF VIOLIN STRINGS

WE CUT TO the hands stringing a VIOLIN Its not a high
end piece but it is quite nice

WE CUT TO a wide shot of the study Sitting in a chair
with violin in hand is SOLOMON NORTHUP a man in his late
twenties Everything about Solomon his mien and manner
is distinguished But he too seems a hardy individual
Someone who has known manual labor in his time

Solomon begins to lightly play his violin as if testing
the strings their tuning Satisfied Solomon begins to
play vigorously As he does we make a HARD CUT TO

INT HOUSELIVING ROOM - EVENING

We come in on a lively affair A dinner party is being
thrown within the confines of a fairly stately house In
attendance are EIGHT COUPLES All are WHITE and all are
FAIRLY YOUNG in their early twenties The men and women
are dressed in very fine attire We should get the sense
that for the most part they are people of means
The furniture has been set aside in the living room At
the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a
REEL

The music they are dancing to is being played by Solomon
having cut directly from the tune he was previously
playing He plays with a light determination and in no
way seems possessed with empty servitude

Solomon concludes the reel and the dancers break into
enthusiastic applause which is followed by personal
thanks and congratulations from all It should be clear
that despite their respective races there is much
admiration and appreciation for Solomons abilities

INT NORTHUP HOUSEBEDROOM - MORNING

It is a Saturday morning Clad in her finest attire is
ANNE Solomons wife a few years younger than he We

see also the Northup children MARGARET who is eight and
ALONZO who is five They are handsome and well groomed
kids Anne straightens up the children She finishes

3 3
she rises up and stands behind them almost as if
preparing to pose for a portrait
They all wait a moment then Solomon enters the foyer
He stands and looks admiringly at his family ADMIRINGLY
stressed It isnt that he doesnt have love for them
he does as well But in the moment he truly admires his
greatest accomplishment a family that is healthy and
well and provided for He goes to his children and
hands each a coin then goes to Anne Gives her a kiss
on the cheek The children giggle at the sight

EXT STREET - DAY

Solomon and his family are out walking along the streets
and groves of Saratoga
The streets are well populated this morning with many
people out strolling Most are WHITE but there are
BLACKS as well They are FREED BLACKS who mingle fairly
easily - though not always completely - with the whites
We see too a few BLACK SLAVES who travel with their
WHITE MASTERS These pairings are largely from the south
and - despite the fact the blacks are slaves - they are
not physically downtrodden not field hands They are
well dressed and leading apparently an easy life -
comparatively speaking - as they trail their masters

As they walk Solomon and his family arrive to an
intersection well-worn and muddied from horse and cart
traffic Solomon and his children easily jump across the
muck Anne stands at the lip of the puddle calls for
Solomon to help her across

ANNE
Solomon
Solomon turning back to his wife with a broad smile
waving her forward

SOLOMON
Come Anne Jump

The children now smiling as well egg their mother on

ALONZO MARGARET
Jump You can make it Ive done it You can make
it

ANNE
I will not ruin my dress Catch
me

Solomon moves close holds out his arms Yet theres
still just a bit of mischievousness in his eyes Anne
gives her husband a lightly stern look to which Solomon
replies

SOLOMON
I will catch you Anne
(BEAT)
I will
Again lightly stern

ANNE
You will

And with that Anne takes the leap Solomon catches her
swings her around grandly and sets her down lightly to
the delighted applause of the children That done
Solomon takes Annes hand and leads her on

As Solomon and his family make their way among the
slaves on the street we see one in particular JASPER
As he trails his MASTER he cant help but note Solomon
and his family as they enter A STORE His intrigue of
this most handsome and harmonious group should be
obvious

With his Master occupied Jasper moves slyly toward the
STORE Frozen on the spot Jasper looks on admiringly

Suddenly a voice barks out-

A VOICE (0S)
Jasper Come on

INT STORE - LATER

We are inside the store of MR CEPHAS PARKER a white man
and a supplier of general goods Solomon greets him

WITH

SOLOMON
Mr Parker

PARKER
Mr Northup Mrs Northup

With money in hand the Northup children move quickly
about the store looking for items to purchase

Anne looks over some silks and fabrics Parker suggests

TO SOLOMON
PARKER (CONTD)
A new cravat Solomon Pure silk
by way of the French

SOLOMON
We are in need of a fresh carry
all for the Mrss travels

PARKER
A years passed Off to Sandy
Hill

ANNE

Using a long pole Mr Parker fetches down a CARRY ALL
from an upper shelf

PARKER
Something to suit your style but
sturdy enough for the forty miles
round trip
Handing the Bag to Anne she is immediately taken by it

ANNE
Its beautiful

SOLOMON

(CAUTIOUSLY)
At what price

ANNE
We will take it Children come
see what your father has just
purchased for me
As the children run over - chattering excitedly about the
new gift - they RUN PAST JASPER who has quietly entered
the store
At the checkout counter sits a portrait of WILLIAM HENRY
HARRISON the edges draped in black crepe Before the
book sits a LEDGER Mr Parker asks of Solomon

PARKER
If you would sign our condolence
book My hope is to find a way to
forward it to the Widow Harrison
Sad days for the nation

SOLOMON
Yes certainly Poor Mrs Harris
and her children I hope brighter
times ahead

FITZGERALD

clearly displeased
(TO PARKER)
My regrets for the intrusion

SOLOMON
No intrusion
Fitzgerald looks to Solomon It is a cold glare as
though he wasnt speaking to and has no interest ina
response from a black man Looking back to Parker

FITZGERALD
Good day sir

INT NORTHUP HOUSEDINING ROOM - EVENING

Anne busy in the kitchen puts the final touches to the
meal which is just about to begin Solomon in the
meanwhile sits at the head of the table reading from a
NEWSPAPER He reads to his children solemn news of the
funeral arrangements for the recently deceased President
Harrison

SOLOMON
Thus has passed away from earth
our late President
Solomon starts from the top of the article

SOLOMON (CONTD)
During the morning from sunrise
the heavy bells had been pealing
forth their slow and solemn toll
while the minute guns announced
that soon the grave would receive
its trust Our city as well as
our entire nation has been called
to weep over the fall of a great
and good man One who was by the
wishes of a large majority of our

people raised to fill the highest
place of trust within their gift
William Henry Harrison
A long moment of quiet the family continuing to eat
Then from Margaret

MARGARET
Will you read it again

ANNE
Not just now darling
Anne enters the dining room and places a large chicken at
the center of the table As she takes a seat all heads
are bowed

MARGARET
For food that stays our hunger
For rest that brings us ease
For homes where memories linger
We give our thanks for these

ALL
Amen

SOLOMON
Margaret that was wonderful

MARGARET
Thank you Papa

SOLOMON
Alonzo do you have something to
say

ALONZO

Yes I helped Momma make this

ANNE
Yes and you were such a good
help Especially making the gravy

MARGARET
Papa I would very much like to
learn how to play the violin
Could you teach me

ALONZO
Me too

MARGARET
Yes but I asked Papa first

SOLOMON
Both of you calm down We will
have our first lesson after this
wonderful dinner And on that
note lets start eating

The family all tuck in to their meal The scene is one of
warmth and happiness

7 INT NORTHUP HOUSE - NIGHT 7

Solomon and Anne have fun and difficulty putting the
unruly children to bed They are tucked in and each
given a kiss good night As Margaret lays down to sleep
Anne blows out the candle darkening the room
Silhouetted in the doorway Solomon takes Anne in his
arms holds her tightly as they both luxuriate in the
simple beautiful gift that is their children

7A 7A
INT NORTHUP HOUSE - NIGHT

Now alone together we see Anne and Solomon wrapped in
each others arms Beyond being physically close
emotionally close they are just so very comfortable with
one another They are the very representation of a

couple who are made for each other

They look at each other for a prolonged time
SOLOMON

(COMICALLY FORLORN)
Three weeks Two days

ANNE
It is the custom I wonder what
youll do without me
SOLOMON
I wont stay idle
SOLOMONs eyes lower

ANNE
Darling its good money

SOLOMON
If only I didnt have to share
your cooking with other people
ANNE holds his gaze

ANNE
You dont
They kiss

8 OMIT 8

9 EXT NORTHUP HOUSE - MORNING 9

We are just outside the Northup house A CARRIAGE waits
with a DRIVER Anne and the children are dressed for
travel - Anne sporting HER NEW CARRY ALL The Driver
loads bags into the carriage

For her parting gift Anne gives her husband a kiss

SOLOMON
Travel safely

ANNE
Stay safely
Anne and the children loaded up the Driver chides the
horse and the carriage heads off Solomon waves a hearty
good bye to his wife and children

10 10
EXT PARK - DAY
Solomon is now out for a stroll He passes two men - two

in particular - who stand outside conversing with MR
MOON himself MERRILL BROWN and ABRAM HAMILTON Brown
is about 40 with a countenance indicating shrewdness and
intelligence Hamilton is closer to 25 a man of fair
complexion and light eyes Both are finely if perhaps a
bit garishly dressed Hamilton as Solomon describes
him slightly effeminate

Moon spotting Solomon

MR MOON
Call the Devils name There he
is now Mr Northup I have

two gentlemen who should make your
acquaintance Messrs Brown and
Hamilton

BROWN
Sir

MR MOON

Mr Northup these two gentlemen
were inquiring about distinguished
individuals and I was just this
very moment telling them that
Solomon Northup is an expert
player on the violin

HAMILTON
He was indeed

SOLOMON
Mr Moon is being overly gracious

10 10

BROWN
Taking into consideration his
graciousness and your modesty may
we trouble you for a moment of
your time to converse sir

11 11
EXT PARKPAVILION - LATER

We make a jump to a green space Solomon Brown and
Hamilton are sitting at a bench

SOLOMON
A circus

HAMILTON
That is our usual employee The
company currently in the city of
Washington

BROWN

Circus too constricting a word to
describe the talented and merry
band with which we travel It is
a spectacle unlike most have ever
witnessed Creatures from the
darkest Africa as yet unseen by
civilized man Acrobats from the
Orient able to contort themselves
in the most confounding manners

HAMILTON
And I myself in aide of Mr Brown
an internationally renowned
practitioner in the art of
prestidigitation

BROWN
We are on our way thither to
rejoin the company having left for
a short time to make a small
profit from our own exhibitions

HAMILTON
The reason for our inquiry with
Mr Moon

BROWN

Yes We had just a devil of a
time in procuring music for our

(MORE)

11 11

BROWN (CONTD)
entertainments Men of true
talent seemingly in short supply

SOLOMON
Thank you sir

BROWN
If we could persuade you to
accompany us as far as New York
We would give you one dollar for
each days service and three
dollars for every night played at
our performances In addition we
would provide sufficient pay for
the expenses of your return from
New York here to Saratoga

SOLOMON
You understand this is all very
sudden

HAMILTON

Consider it an opportunity to see
THE COUNTRY--

SOLOMON
Its intriguing

HAMILTON
If there is any way in which you
would give consideration to the
offer
Solomon gives the whole deal one last consideration

SOLOMON
The payment offered is enticement
enough as is my desire to visit
the metropolis

HAMILTON
We are delighted sir So
delighted Though we would add
that our travel plans--

BROWN
We would like to depart with
haste
( )

11 11

SOLOMON
As luck would have it my wife and
children are traveling I will
write her of our plans

BROWN
Excellent I would beg you

collect yourself then we may
proceed

12 12
INT NORTHUP HOUSEBEDROOM - LATER
Back in his house we see Solomon packing putting some

clothes in a travel case and collecting his violin as
well

13 INT NORTHUP HOUSESTUDY - LATER 13

Solomon sits down to write a letter pen poised over
paper with already a few lines written But Solomon
thinks better of it WITH LITTLE THOUGHT HE TEARS THE
PAPER AND SETS IT ASIDE WE SHOULD GET THE SENSE THAT

THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE BY LETTER
IS LOST ON SOLOMON THIS FACT WILL HAVE GREAT WEIGHT IN

THE NEAR FUTURE

14 14
EXT SOLOMONS HOUSEINT COVERED CARRIAGE - LATER

Solomon enters the buggy carpet bag in hand Brown and
Hamilton are waiting They ride in a covered carriage
led by a pair of noble horses

HAMILTON
No letter to post

SOLOMON
No need My return will coincide
with my familys

BROWN
Were off then

15 15

INT PUB - EVENING

-MID TO LATE APRIL 1841-

We find ourselves in a roadside pub It serves the
purpose of drinking and diversion and little more As
Solomon plays his violin Brown and Hamilton perform a
decent paired magic routine before a SPARSE AUDIENCE NOT

OF SELECT CHARACTER

16 INT PUB - LATER 16

After the show the pub now fairly empty Solomon
Hamilton and Brown sit down to eat Hamilton and Brown
drink but again Solomon abstains Though Solomon
remains cool Hamilton and Brown put up a great show of
being disappointed as Hamilton counts out what little
money was collected

HAMILTON
Not an additional tip from a one
of them They expect to be
entertained for nothing

BROWN
And not satisfied a bit despite
giving them more than what they
paid for

SOLOMON
Its the national mood Theres
too much grief to make room for
frivolity

HAMILTON
My sincerest apologies Solomon
You were promised opportunity and
you were given none

BROWN
The opportunity is with the
circus A two man show poorly
promoted what were we to expect
But the circus bills itself

HAMILTON
True

BROWN
I have told you of the circus with
which we are connected Creatures
from the darkest of Africa
Acrobats from the Orient who--

SOLOMON
You have described it yes

BROWN
Yes We need to return
immediately to Washington
SolomonI believe us familiar
enough now but forgive me if I am
boldwould you consider making
the trip with us
Solomon gives a bit of a laugh at the idea

16 16

HAMILTON
Entertaining at pubs and inns has
its place but a man of your
skills deserves better

BROWN
Hear hear

HAMILTON
And more importantly you would
build your own name and following
The circus tends to attract those
with the highest of reputations
An introduction here and there
could amount to a lifetime of
reward Now would be the time
With your family away an
opportunity presents itself

BROWN
Said as fellow artists as well as
businessmen Well worth the
effort at least

SOLOMON
You present a flattering
representation As my family will
be traveling back shortly perhaps
I might commit only to one trial
engagement

HAMILTON
Oh very good sir Very good I
cannot recall being so excited

BROWN
There is a practical concern If
you are to continue on with us you
should obtain your free papers
SOLOMON
Not necessary

BROWN
Here in New York no But we will
be entering slave states and as a
matter of precaution Its to
all our benefit we should not have
to come to account for your well
being

HAMILTON
Six shillings worth of effort
could well save much trouble
later

12a
16 16

BROWN
Well go to the Customs House in
the morning then travel on Good
business all around

18 EXT WASHINGTON - DAY 18

The city is a swarm of people At the moment the populace
is displaying both sorrow and anticipation Sorrow for
the loss of the President Many are dressed in black

and black crepe hangs nearly everywhere Black armbands
are frequently seen and the occasional American Flag
hung at half mast As well there are portraits of
Harrison at varying locations
Having arrived in Washington Solomon Hamilton and Brown

RIDE ONWARD IN THEIR CARRIAGE

19 19
INT GADSBY HOTELDINNING ROOM - EVENING

A decent though crowded boisterous and smoke-filled
joint Very lively Solomon Hamilton and Brown are
among several parties drinking in the hotels bar As
with seemingly everywhere in the city black crepes
accessorize the background Brown counts out 4300 IN
COIN on the tabletop Solomon is astonished by the
amount

BROWN
Forty-three dollars All to you

SOLOMON
Thatits far more than my wages
amount to

BROWN

Consider the remainder an advance
from the circus I cannot tell
youI honestly wish you had seen
the expression of our director
when I described your abilities
He was fairly overcome with

excitement

HAMILTON
You should have invited him to sup
with us

BROWN

I did I did but so many
preparations before the company is
to depart

SOLOMON
GENTLEMEN- -

BROWN
Tomorrow we shall prepare for our
Washington debut But tonight our
thoughts are with the great man

BROWN (CONTD)
for whom this city prepared solemn
memorial He has passed from the
praise of men to receive the
plaudit of his heavenly father A
fine man has passed Let us
remember him with a drink

19 19
Both Hamilton and Brown hold up their tankards to drink
Solomon a bit reluctantly does the same

HAMILTON
Cheers

BROWN
Another Our departed President
deserves all the salutation we can
imbibe
Hamilton and Brown drink again and Solomon does as well

22 EXT ALLEY - LATER 22
WE MAKE A HARD CUT to Solomon outside of the Pub in an
alley with Brown and Hamilton in silhouette back-lit by
the street lights He is violently ill hunched over and
retching horribly

HAMILTON
Thats all right Solomon No
shame in it No shame at all

A23 INT GADSBY HOTEL - STAIRCASE A23

Hamilton and Brown help Solomon to lumber up the spiral
staircase passing the occasional bemused guest

23 INT GADSBY HOTELSOLOMONS ROOM - NIGHT 23

Hamilton is placing a spittoon near Solomons bed where
a prone and reeling Solomon lays Hamilton sits on the
bed As he strokes Solomons sweaty face Hamilton
speaks sweetly

HAMILTON
Im afraid that Brown and I
havent brought you much luck
But rough waters bring smooth
sailing Eventually they do

SOLOMON
-SOSO Sorry

HAMILTON
Shhh We wont hear it We
wont

BROWN
Let him sleep

HAMILTON
Hmm A good nights sleep And
tomorrowtomorrow you will feel
as well and refreshed as though
the earth were new again
Hamilton lingers a bit too long and a bit too close to
Solomon for Browns taste With more than a bit of

SIGNIFICATION
BROWN
Hamilton Nothing more we can do
for him
HAMILTON

Such is the pity

Displaying an odd sort of disappointment Hamilton slinks
away from the bed He crosses to and BLOWS OUT A

CANDLE The room goes dark with a blackness more than
night Brown and Hamilton exit Solomon lays in the

dark and moans His sounds becoming MORE AND MORE

DISTRESSED

24 24

INT BURCHS DUNGEON - DAWN

24 24
Solomon stirs then slowly awakes to his new
circumstances He finds himself in a nearly lightless
room about twelve feet square with walls of solid
masonry There is a thick and well-locked door a small
window covered with iron bars and a shutter The only
furniture is a wood stool and an old fashioned dirty box
stove As Solomon rises he sees that his HANDS are
CUFFED - the chain running to a bolt in the ground - and
his LEGS IN IRONS At first Solomon is incredulous But
that emotion is replaced first by fury and then panic
He begins to pull on the chains fight against them He
does so with increasing desperation Solomon flails
about the sounds of the steel chains whipping and
beating against the masonry He grunts and screams
without regard as the cuffs and irons bite into his
flesh but he cannot pull himself free

After several minutes of intense effort Solomon tires
slows then finally he collapses And in this collapsed
state he remains

25 25
INT BURCHS DUNGEON - MORNING

Solomon again awakens He hears sounds beyond the
doorfootsteps Eventually the door opens Enter
JAMES BURCH - who runs the slave pen - and EBENEZER
RADBURN who works as a turnkey and overseer

As the door opens this is the first light to seep into
the otherwise near-black room The shine is painful to
Solomons eyes With no salutation whatsoever Burch

ASKS

BURCH
Well my boy how yah feel now
Solomon rises up as best he can With all the resolve he
can put together he states what he considers to be fact

SOLOMON
I am Solomon Northup I ama free
man a resident of Saratoga New
York The residence also of my
wife and children who are equally
free I have papers You have no
right whatsoever to detain me--

BURCH
Yah not any--

SOLOMON
And I promise you - I promise -
upon my liberation I will have
satisfaction for this wrong

BURCH
Resolve this Produce your
papers
( )

25 25
With confidence Solomon goes to the pocket of his
trousers He searches one then the other but they are
empty He feels quickly about himself but clearly his
papers have been lifted Solomons confidence shifts
but to resolve rather than fear Papers or none he will
not be easily cowed Still Burch asserts

BURCH (CONTD)
Yah no free man And yah aint
from Saratoga Yah from Georgia
A moment Not a word spoken among the trio but Solomon
and Burch do some serious eye fucking neither man
yielding Burch says again

BURCH (CONTD)
Yah aint a free man Yah nuthin
but a Georgia runaway
Burch waits for Solomon to acquiesce Solomon does not
in any way Both men exchange a long and daring stare
The two are clearly at an intellectual stand off Burch
leans to Radburn SAYS SOMETHING WHICH WE CANNOT

DISTINGUISH

Radburn walks off-camera and returns with a pair of
instruments a PADDLE - the flattened portion which is
about the size in circumference of two open hands and
bored with a small auger in numerous places He also
carries a WHIP A cat-o-nine tails a large rope of many
strands The strands unraveled and a knot tied at the
extremity of each Burch says again

BURCH (CONTD)
Yah a runaway nigger from Georgia
Solomon stands with a quiet stoicism He will say
nothing of the kind
As that is the case Solomon is seized by both men He is
pulled over the bench face downward shirt still on his
back Radburn then STEPS ON HIS CHAINS holding Solomon
down in a bent position
With no preamble Burch begins to beat Solomon about the
back with the paddle Burch strikes him wordlessly - no
taunting no sneering Solomon screaming against each
blow His back immediately SWELLING WITH WELTS AND

BRUISES

This beating continues on and on and on until quite
literally Burch WEARS HIMSELF OUT with the effort
Dripping in sweat and panting

25 25

BURCH (CONTD)
Yah still insist yah a free man

SOLOMON
-II insist
Burch regrets hearing this Not from sympathy but
rather because hes nearly too tired to go back to
beating Solomon Yet as if returning to work Burch
returns to pummeling Solomon Burch punctuates the blows

WITH
BURCH
Yah a slave Yah a Georgia slave
Burch continues to strike and strike This time until

the paddle SNAPS IN HALF Burch then GRABS THE WHIP
Hardly missing a stroke he whips Solomon relentlessly
the flails cutting into Solomons back Again Burchs
arm tires before Solomon breaks

BURCH (CONTD)
Are yah slave

SOLOMON
No
Burch goes back to whipping and whipping and whipping

SOLOMONS BACK IS NOW TORN OPEN WITH LACERATIONS AND
OOZING WITH BLOOD Finally Burch can whip no more He
pours sweat and sucks air leaving himself just enough
energy to take up his instruments and EXIT Radburn
lingers for a moment He takes the irons off Solomons
legs Opens the window some As he makes these
gestures in a patronizing and confidential manner one
wrought with poor sincerity

RADBURN
I seen a good many of the black
kind just where yahre Sick
Make me sick Often times the
situation was resolved and I
think what was all the beatin
and abuse for Things end as they
should and the violence was for
naught So why cause trouble when
they aint no cause for it Be of
a cooperative nature and things
dont need be particularly
unpleasant

(BEAT)
Or yah can carry on like yah
been and I fear yah wont live to
see Sunday next
With that thought Radburn exits Solomon rests But to
rest seems like giving in to defeat He begins pulling

25 25
on his chains But for all his struggling the chain
loosens none Solomon calls out

SOLOMON
Help me Someone help me
If anyone at all hears him they do not respond Solomon
continues his plaintive cry for assistance

26 26
EXT BURCHS DUNGEON - CONTINUOUS

Beginning with a TIGHT SHOT on the shuttered barred
window of Burchs dungeon - Solomons cries barely eking
beyond the space - THE CAMERA PULLS BACK from the
building onto the city until clearly visible is the
Nations capital Its icons of freedom - the WHITE
HOUSE the CAPITOL BUILDING - fairly mocking Solomons
captivity Simultaneously barren at the early hour and
cluttered with litter and the remains of previous days
procession the city is a bleak and forboding sight

27 27
INT BURCHS DUNGEON - DAY

IT IS DAY NOW The door to the yard is thrown open The
harsh white light floods all over Solomon

28 OMITTED 28

29 MOVED TO SC A32 29

30 EXT BURCHS DUNGEONYARD - DAY 30

It is a yard just beyond Burchs The yard is hemmed in
by a brick wall In the yard are two men and a boy
The oldest is CLEMENS RAY a man of about 25 years of age
He is well educated JOHN WILLIAMS is about 20 years
old He is born and bred a slave is lacking in
education and overwhelmed with fear of the situation
Finally there is a child about 10 years of age who
answers to the name of Randall

Solomon Clemens Ray John and Randall ALL STAND NAKED
Though they try to cover their privates a bit they are
all aware of the uselessness of modesty Radburn is
present He has before him A COUPLE OF BUCKETS OF COLD
WATER He throws water on the naked men

RADBURN
Go on Warsh up
The men soaking in humility as well as water begin to
scrub with A SINGLE BAR OF HARSH SOAP passed among them

RADBURN (CONTD)
The boy too Get him clean
Solomon takes some soap and rubs it over Randall

RADBURN (CONTD)
Scrub now Git em clean
Solomon scrubs harder Randall - clearly cold and
uncomfortable - appeals to Solomon

RANDALL
Do you know when my Mama will
come

RADBURN

Hush him up
Seeing Solomon has no answer for him Randall begins to
cry

RANDALL

Mama Mama Is she going to

come

Doing all he can to spare the child from a certain
BEATING

SOLOMON
Quiet please
Randall is becoming nearly inconsolable

RANDALL
Mama

21A

30 30

Saying anything to keep the boy quiet
SOLOMON
Your mother will come I swear she
will but you must be silent
Please Be silent
On the seeming strength of Solomons promise Randall
goes silent Solomon looks to Radburn who just throws
water on the soapy men

31 OMITTED 31

A32 INT BURCHS DUNGEON - EVENING A32

Radburn brings food in to Solomon a shriveled piece of
meat and some water Just barely enough to sustain
Solomon Radburn also has a SHIRT

RADBURN
That old thing of yours is just
rags and tatters Need something
proper to wear
Solomon doesnt move for the clothing

RADBURN (CONTD)
Gowon Put it on
With slow defiance Solomon does as instructed He
removes what remains of his old shirt - the one he was
wearing when first kidnapped - and puts on the one
Radburn brought him The shirts ill-fitting and dirty
Despite that Radburn says

RADBURN (CONTD)
There Thas fine Thas fine
Got no gratitude

SOLOMON
Thank you

RADBURN
Yah keep bein proper yahll see
how things work out
Radburn starts to take the old shirt

SOLOMON
No It was from my wife
RADBURN
Rags and tatters Rags and
tatters
Taking the shirt the rags and tatters as he calls
them Radburn exits locking the door behind him
Solomon sits with the plate of food before him He
pushes the plate away rather than eat

32 32
EXT BURCHS DUNGEONYARD - DAY

Sitting together out in the yard are Clemens Ray John
and Solomon Over time they have drawn trustworthy
enough to speak with one another At the moment Solomon
is still trying to apply reason to the situation

22a

32 32
Randall wanders about in the background As usual he
calls out for his Mama By now however his calls
should feel like little more than background noise

SOLOMON
This cant stand It is a crime
I believe now someone lay in wait
for me My drink was altered
We are free men They havethey
have no right to hold us
Solomon waits for a response from the others They give
none

SOLOMON (CONTD)
We need a sympathetic ear If we
have an opportunity to explain our

SITUATION--
CLEMENS

Who in your estimation is that
sympathetic ear
SOLOMON
The two men I journeyed with Im
certain theyre making inquires at
this very moment

CLEMENS
I would be just as certain they
are counting the money paid for
delivering you to this place

SOLOMON
They were not kidnappers They
were artists Fellow performers

CLEMENS
You know that You know for
certain who they were

32 32
The fact is Solomon cant say for certain

CLEMENS (CONTD)
How I reckon the situation

RANDALL
Mama
All three men turn and look At the moment Randall
doesnt call out emptily At the door to the yard is
Burch along with two women One in her late twenties
ELIZA She is arrayed in silk with rings upon her
fingers and golden ornaments suspended from her ears
Though a slave Eliza was a mistress and has - to this
point - lived well This is reflected in her airs and
her speech The other is a little girl light in skin
color of about seven or eight This is EMILY Randalls
half sister
As she enters the yard Eliza squeals with high delight
then breaks into tears of both sorrow and joy Clearly
this is mother and child being reunited

As Burch locks the yard door Eliza clutches Randall

She is overcome with emotion

ELIZA
My darling My sweet sweet baby

INT BURCHS DUNGEON - EVENING

Later in the evening Solomon now shares his space with
Eliza and her children As the children rest Eliza
drops into a lament as if pleading her case to Solomon
who lends a sympathetic ear

Both slyly and with a bit of aggrandizement

ELIZA
When I say I had my masters
favor you understand Above even
his own wife I had it Do you
know that he built a house for me
Built it on the sole condition
that I reside there with him The
added promise in time I would be
emancipated And for nine years
he blessed me with every comfort
and luxury in life
Displaying the finery she still wears

ELIZA (CONTD)
Silks and jewels and even servants
to wait upon us Such was our
life and the life of this
beautiful girl I bore for him
But Master Berrys daughtershe
always looked at me with an unkind
nature She hated Emily no matter
she and Emily were flesh of flesh
As Master Berrys health failed
she gained power in the household
Eventually I was brought to the
city on the false pretense of our
free papers being executed If I
had known what waited to be sent
south I swear I would not have
come here alive

33 33
Eliza turns to her children

ELIZA (CONTD)
My poor poor babies

34 INT BURCHS DUNGEON - NIGHT 34

Its the deep of night all are sleeping A KEY TURNS IN

beside him Both carry LANTERNS with them Hardly

giving Solomon and Eliza a moment to rouse themselves

BURCH DEMANDS

BURCH

Sensing that things will not end well

ELIZA

BURCH

Not wanting to hear any of this talk Burch strikes John
several times in the head with a sap-like instrument
Weakened but again

JOHN (CONTD)

Burch again strikes John until hes quiet Curiously
Emily and Randall dont even flinch Why would they
They are quite used to seeing this kind of violence

The slaves are lead to a flat bed of the horse and

with them as some sort of cloth is flung over them
obscuring and blacking out their view

At that moment the screen is BLACKENED and we hear the
sound of the cart moving in haste

EXT WASHINGTON DC DOCK - NIGHT

Led by Burch the group of slaves arrive to a dock They
are taken quickly up a gangplank and onto the steamboat
ORLEANS as the CAPTAIN CREW and a MULATTO WOMAN WATCH
but do not interfere

37 37
INT ORLEANSHOLD - CONTINUOUS

The slaves are hustled down one at a time into a dark
dank hold among barrels and boxes of freightand RATS
Burch comes around and checks the chains makes sure
they are all secure and locked

Satisfied he heads up out of the hold Radburn follows
Alone in the dark in the hold John cries as does Eliza
Solomon stares down Burch for as long as he can as if
wishing bad things As if wanting to exact some measure
of revenge But the greater insult is that Burch and
Radburn engaged in conversation take no notice of
Solomon whatsoever He is that insignificant to them
That fact that reality makes Solomon boil with a rage
he cannot express in words

Clemens Ray and Solomon watch as the Mulatto Woman
returns to top deck the trapdoor locked firmly behind
her Clemens Ray turns to Solomon with a deadpan stern
expression

CLEMENS RAY
If you want to survive do and say
as little as possible Tell no

43A EXT NORFOLKPORT - DAY 43A

We see a flat overhead view of the port of Norfolk
Sardines are laid out to dry in rows glittering in the
days sun as if like silver pennies A chain of slaves
enter the frame and are led one by one on to the docked
vessel

MORE SLAVES - about 15 in all of various genders and
ages - are brought on board Chief among them is ROBERT
who fights viciously with his captors With all haste
is shoved down into the hold

Having taken their cargo as far as they care or need to
Burch and Radburn depart They do so without a word
spoken to Solomon or the others

With this new and sizable batch of slaves on board the
crew again CASTS OFF and the Orleans makes its way
again

44 INT ORLEANSGALLEY 44

Solomon is back cleaning in the galley As he cleans he
again watches Robert prep food Roberts skill with a
knife is not lost on Solomon

45 INT HOLD - LATER - DAY 45

The hold is packed tighter now
Muzzle covering his face Robert is shackled with his
hands tied behind his back Solomon and Clemens Ray look
on
A sailor descends the staircase and takes off Roberts
muzzle shooting him a forbidding look He leaves

ROBERT
I say we fight
Robert delivers this in a hushed voice

SOLOMON
The crew is fairly small If it
were well planned I believe
they could be strong armed

CLEMENS RAY
Three cant stand against a whole
crew The rest here are niggers
born and bred slaves Niggers
aint got the stomach for a fight
not a damn one

ROBERT
All I know we get where we
travelling well wish wed died
trying

CLEMENS RAY
Survival is not about certain
death it is about keeping your
head down
Solomon looks at Clemens Ray agitated -- his voice now
raised above the previous whispers Grits his teeth

The slaves are asleep

A Sailor descends the ladder approaching Eliza He bends
down and attempts to wake the daughter by caressing her
face

Solomon rouses and looks across to witness the scene
From his vantage point we see Eliza stand to interrupt
the Sailor The Sailor looks at Eliza Eliza looks back
at him Knowingly she leads him off into a corner of the
hold

As she does so Eliza passes Robert who jumps up to stand
between Eliza and the Sailor Stretching out a firm hand
to the sailors shoulder Roberts look says No you
dont

Clemens Ray is awake now watching

There is an odd moment of stillness between the Sailor
and Robert an impasse

We focus on the Sailors face Slowly a greasy smile
erupts upon it Back now to Roberts face a look of
incomprehension

Robert looks down We follow his gaze to the knife that
has already been jabbed unseen between Roberts ribs
The sailor withdraws the bloody blade

A wide shot of the two men Robert collapses to the
floor like a sack of potatoes

-MID MAY 1841-
A white male fairly smart with broad shoulders stands
AND BELLOWS-

RAY
Clemens Clemens Ray

We are in the port of New Orleans one of the busiest in
the young nation

On the dock itself there is a bustle of activity as goods
are loaded and unloaded from a various ships Its a bit
of controlled chaos as a VARIETY OF LANGUAGES are spoken
and shouted while slaves are shuttled from the Orleans to
a holding pen Solomon and all the slaves are
overwhelmed by all that is happening around them

Two men - among many - are awaiting the arrival of the
Orleans They are JONUS RAY - Clemens Rays master - and
DAVIS who is the solicitor of Mr Ray They both look
like they mean business The moment the gangplank is
laid Ray yells for Clemens

Clemens seeing his master is nearly crazy with delight
He is uncharacteristically beside himself Ironically
his master now represents freedom

52 52

CLEMENS
-My master Master Ray sir
Master Ray
Clemens pulls on his chain As he does so Several other
slaves collapse in his effort to reach his master like
dominos

RAY
Who is in charge of this vessel

CAPTAIN
I am the Captain

RAY
I am Mr Jonus Ray My solicitor
has documentation verifying that
the Negro named Clemens Ray is my
property
As he reads PAPERS handed to him by Davis
CAPTAIN
I know nothing of--

RAY
You are ordered by court to return
that property immediately or face
charges of thievery

CAPTAIN
My duty is to transport goods I
am not responsible for their
origin

RAY
Remove these contraptions
To his mate

CAPTAIN
Free him
Biddee does as ordered Once free Clemens hugs and sobs
over his master as would a lost and then found child

RAY
Its all well now Clemens You
will return home with me
(to the Captain)
Consider this notice and warning

52 52
Ray Davis and Clemens head away Solomon seems both
desperate and hopeful of some aid from Clemens and Ray
But there is none forthcoming Ray and Clemens continue
on - Clemens not so much as even looking back in
Solomons direction Solomon stands and watches as they
fade into the environs and are gone from sight

53 53
EXT NEW ORLEANSPORT - LATER

Hours later The slaves sit off on one side of the dock
baking in the sun awaiting their fate

THEOPHILUS FREEMAN - a tall thin-faced man with light
complexion and a little bent - moves along the deck
calling out names from a list The slaves STAND as they
are called

FREEMAN
Oren John Lethe Eliza
Randal Emily Platt Platt

Solomon does not respond Freeman looks around He
spots Solomon

FREEMAN (CONTD)
Captain who shipped that nigger

CAPTAIN
Burch
Freeman steps to Solomon He gives him a looking over

FREEMAN
Stand up
Solomon does as told

FREEMAN (CONTD)
You fit the description given
Why didnt you answer when called

SOLOMON
My name is not Platt My name is--
Freeman strikes Solomon hard across the face

FREEMAN
Your name is Platt and I will
teach you your name so that you
dont forget
(to the Captain)
Shackle my niggers Get them to
my cart

54 IE CART - LATER 54

Solomon is carted off along with the rest of Burchs
stock Eliza and her children John and Solomon

As they move off from the port in a make-shift cart it
opens up to the frenzic busy port

For the first time Solomon sees true and severe slavery
These are not visiting servants such as Jasper was back
in Saratoga These are humans held in strict bondage -
herded like cattle chained together as if in a chain
gang Slaves are evident not merely by the color of
their skin The residue and accessories of slavery are
everywhere Blacks almost universally display scars -

THICK AND HEAVY DEAD TISSUE FROM LACERATIONS LEFT
UNTREATED - brands and are often missing limbs Blacks
are held in all types of shackles from simple chains to
elaborate bindings to neck collars that are spiked
Some are muzzled or forced to wear bits One slave is
attacked by a dog and the slave owner The dog pulls and
tears at the slaves clothes THESE IMAGES SHOULD BE A

CONSTANT AND CONTINUAL CANVAS TO THE PIECE EVER

PRESENT BUT NOT REALLY COMMENTED ON AS THEY ARE THE
NORM They should be a reminder that not only are people
being oppressed but that there is an entire system of
oppression in place

55 55
EXT FREEMANS SLAVE PEN - LATER

Burchs stock arrive at Freemans slave pen They are
led in by Freeman and his house slave CAPE - a mulatto
The yard is enclosed by plank standing upright with
ends sharpened instead of brick walls as with Burchs
Including Burchs group there are about 30 SLAVES in the
pen

Solomon and the others look around and see nothing but
downtrodden and despondent faces Three men sit next to
each other with muzzles and quietly stare back at this
new batch of arrivals One attempts to speak but all
that comes out is a muffled unintelligible sound

56 56
EXT FREEMANS SLAVE PEN - LATER

The slaves are in various states of undress men and
women alike They clean themselves scrubbing with soap
and water Women wash their hair Men shave skin is
oiled Freeman walks among them inspecting them as they
primp themselves

57 57
INT FREEMANS SLAVE PEN - LATER

The slaves are given new clothes by Cape The men are
given hat coat shirt pants and shoes The women

57 57
frocks of calico and handkerchiefs to bind about their
heads

58 INT FREEMANSGREAT ROOM - LATER 58

ts an odd ironic scene The slaves are in a large and
fairly ornate room within Freemans house CAPE PLAYS A
PAINFUL TUNE ON A FIDDLE - background music - as Freeman
tries to line up A SMALL GROUP OF THE SLAVES he becomes
less patient jittery and nervous knowing that his
livelihood is at stake he wants his slaves to make a
good impression Sometimes his patience gets the better
of him and his hands move freely in direction of the
slaves
The business has the air of an etiquette class though
what Freeman is trying to do is coach the slaves into
being more sellable He works with them in groups of
five or so

FREEMAN
Tallest to smallest understand
Are you taller than her Then
youd go before her Do it
Move
(to the group)
Keep your heads up A sense of
direction thats how you look
smart None of those saucer eyes
Rid yourself of that smile Look
like a goddamn grinnin monkey
Put the least thought in your
head Cmon now Think of
somethin’
Weary of Capes playing Solomon moves to Cape He asks

SOLOMON
Can you play a reel

CAPE

(DISMISSIVE)
Nah I dont know no reel

SOLOMON
If I may
Cape looks to Freeman

FREEMAN
He sick of your caterwaulin Let
him play boy Lets see what he
can do
Cape reluctantly hands the fiddle over to Solomon
Solomon tunes it a bit then begins to play His fingers
stiff at first he takes a moment to warm up But as he
warms up he is despite the circumstances masterful

58 58
THE SLAVES ALL CLAP ALONG SOME DANCE ALONG All admire
his work Freeman chief among them

FREEMAN (CONTD)
Keep on Keep on
Solomon continues to play

FREEMAN (CONTD)
A damn sight better than you
Cape A damn sight better
Cape looks bitter as Solomon plays on

59 59
INT FREEMANSGREAT ROOM - DAY

We come in on an odd sort of sight A JUMBLE OF ACTIVITY
CUSTOMERS have come to see Freemans lot - the room all
gussied up with flowers Freeman moves among them
displaying them as a rancher would prize chattel

Freeman makes the slaves hold their heads up - look
smart as he previously admonished them They are made
to walk briskly back and forth while customers feel their
hands and arms and bodies turn them about and ask what
skills they possess The Customers routinely make the
slaves open their mouths and show their teeth

At times a MALE or FEMALE SLAVE are taken off to the
side stripped and inspected more minutely

One of them John is stripped and inspected

Cape as hes done previously plays his fiddle

A buyer - WILLIAM FORD a man of middle age and an
attractive nature in his tone of voice - consults a list
hes drawn up and asks of Freeman

FORD
What is the price for the ones
Platt and Eliza

FREEMAN
A thousand for Platt he is a
nigger of talent Seven hundred
for Eliza My fairest price

FORD
You will accept a note

FREEMAN
As always from you Mr Ford
Eliza is beside herself as it seems she is about to be
separated from her family She begs of Ford

( )

59 59
ELIZA
Please sir Please dont

divide my family Dont take me
unless you take my children as
well

FREEMAN
Eliza quiet

ELIZA
You will have the most faithful
slave in me sir The most
faithful slave that has ever
lived but I beg that you do not
separate us
A BUYER interrupts the skirmish and approaches Freeman
and delivers coolly eyeing Randall-

BUYER
Your price for the child

FREEMAN
You see how fit the boy is Like
ripe fruit He will grow into a
fine beast
Randall is made to run and jump by FREEMAN - exhibiting
his activity and his condition

FREEMAN (CONTD)
Six hundred and thats fair and
final

BUYER
Done
He reaches into his waistcoat and retrieves his wallet
counting out six hundred dollars placing them into the
already extended hand of Freeman
Ford sees the distress and panic in Eliza it visibly
touches him He now tries to buy EMILY to console her

FORD
How much for the little girl You
have no need for her One so
young will bring you no profit

FREEMAN
I will not sell the girl Theres
heaps n piles of money to be made
off her She is a beauty One of
the regular bloods None of your
thick-lipped bullet headed
cotton picking niggers

39A
59 59

FORD
Her child man For Gods sake
are you not sentimental in the
least

FREEMAN

My sentimentality stretches the
length of a coin Do you want the
lot Mr Ford or do you pass on

them all
FORD
will take the ones Platt and
Eliza

Eliza grips her children tight

ELIZA
I will not go without my children
You will not take them from me

59 59
As if to prove her wrong Freeman puts a foot to Eliza
and harshly kicks her away from Emily

ELIZA (CONTD)
Please dont No
Freeman to Cape

FREEMAN
Take her out of here
Cape DROPS HIS FIDDLE begins to pull Eliza away toward
the door of the room but her screaming and pleading do
not abate IT IS CLEARLY UNSETTLING TO THE OTHER BUYERS

FREEMAN (CONTD)
Keep her quiet
Cape tries to muzzle her with his hand but Eliza
continues to scream for her children as Emily does for
her mother

EMILY
Mama Mama

FREEMAN

(TO SOLOMON)
Play something Get the fiddle
and play
As ordered Solomon takes up Capes fiddle and begins to
play lightly

FREEMAN (CONTD)
Play
Solomon plays harder and more loudly Still it is
barely enough to drown out Elizas cries Freeman gets
the other slaves to clap along with Solomons playing
Emily frees herself and runs back crying but endeavoring
to be strong-

EMILY
Dont cry Mama I will be a good
girl Dont cry I will keep my
head up and I will look smart I
will always look smart

FREEMAN
Make merry all of you Goddamn
it Cape Keep her quiet or its
your damned hide I will take it
out of
Cape pulls a rag stuffs it in Elizas mouth Clamping
both hands over her mouth he hauls Eliza from the room
by the head IT IS AN UGLY UGLY SCENE

the plantation - the GREAT HOUSE as they are commonly
called - is sizable Two stories high with a piazza in

Run nigger run well you better get away

One has a bushel And one has a peck

One had a rope and it was hung around his neck
Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you

Run nigger run well the pattyroller will get you
Run nigger run well you better get away
Oh nigger run and nigger flew

It is a sizable work area on the edge of Indian Creek
There is much work being done the slaves primarily
employed in piling the timber and chopping it into

EXT FORD PLANTATION - DAY

-EARLY TO MID JUNE 1841-

Its Sunday morning All of Fords slaves are dressed

with their finest clothes - brightly colored and as

free as possible of defect The slaves are gathered on

65 65
the lawn just beyond the piazza Mistress Ford is
present as well As the slaves listen Ford reads to
them Scripture His tone is of a man trying to preach by
way of compassion

FORD
But as touching the resurrection
of the dead have ye not read that
which was spoken unto you by God
saying I am the God of Abraham
and the God of Isaac and the God
of Jacob God is not the God of
the dead but of the living And
when the multitude heard this
they were astonished at his
doctrine Then one of them which
was a lawyer asked hima
question tempting him and
saying Master which is the

great commandment in the law
Jesus said unto him Thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with all thy
heart and with all thy soul and
with all thy mind This is the
first and great commandment And
the second is like unto it thou
shalt love thy neighbor as
thyself On these two

commandments hang all the law and
the prophets

Despite the lightness with which Ford speaks and the hope
in his words ELIZA SITS OFF TO THE SIDE - SELF-SECLUDED

A BIT - WEEPING GENTLY
We should be able to see in Mistress Fords eyes that
Elizas constant crying is unsettling

meat and drink water from gourds As they lunch Solomon
reads from Sams Bible to the other slaves

SOLOMON
But he that is greatest among you
let him be as the younger and he
that is chief as he that doth
serve For whether is greater he
that sitteth at meat or he that
serveth Is not he that sitteth
at meat But I am among you as he

A white customer - WINSLOW - irate at the sight and sound
of slaves reading Scripture crosses over He grabs the
Bible

WINSLOW
From where did you thieve this

Suh the book is my property
The White Customer has no interest in Sams answer With
flailing hands he STARTS BEATING ON SAM Solomon tries
to stop him That only makes the situation worse
Solomon now the target of the mans ire

72 EXT ROAD - DAY 72

Sam is at the reigns of the wagon carrying the timber to
Fords WORK AREA Slaves trudge alongside same as it
ever was Onlyits not quite the same Sam brings

the wagon to a halt He and the slaves look up the road
ahead of them

Standing in the middle of the road is a group of
CHICKASAWS INDIANS They are in their usual dress of
buckskin breeches and calico hunting shirts of fantastic
colors buttoned from belt to chin They have with them
DOGS and HORSES They carry with them the carcass of a
deer

The two groups stare at each other for a long moment

73 «73

EXT FIELD - DUSKEND OF DAY
The groups of slaves and Chickasaws are now intermingled
They break bread - actually they work on the carcass of
the deer which is now roasting over a large fire As

well the group share a smoke on a pipe

One of the Chickasaws is playing a tune on an INDIAN
FIDDLE The Chickasaws perform a customary dance
trotting after each other and giving utterance to a
guttural sing-song noise

The slaves enjoy the respite from work Solomon
particularly taken by the musicif not entirely
enthralled by it

73 73
After a bit Solomon rights himself and heads from the
group

74 EXT RIVER BANK - CONTINUOUS 74

Solomon arrives to some tall grass at the edge of the
river Lowering his trousers SOLOMON SQUATS TO
DEFECATE As he does he stares out toward the flowing
waters of Indian Creek After a few moments as though a
thought far greater than relieving himself has come to
him Solomon stands and replaces his pants

Oddly Solomon stares out at the water as though he were
a man possessed

75 75
EXT FORDS WORK AREA - DAY

Just beyond the WORK AREA Solomon speaks with Ford as
Tibeats listens Solomon is drawing in the dirt making
rough diagrams for Ford as he explains himself

SOLOMON
The creek is plenty deep enough to
sail even with a boat full of
load The distance from the WORK
AREA to the point on the latter
bayou is several miles by water
fewer than land It occurs to me
that the expense of the
transportation would be materially

DIMINISHED --

TIBEATS
Materially diminished

SOLOMON
If we use the waterway

TIBEATS
Its a scheme Plenty of
engineers have schemed similarly
The passes are too tight

SOLOMON
I reckon them at more than twelve
feet at their most narrow Wide
enough for a tub to traverse A
team of niggers can clear it out

TIBEATS
And you know what of transport and
terra formin

75 75

SOLOMON
I labored repairing the Champlain
canal on the section over which
William Van Nortwick was
superintendent With my earnings
I hired several efficient hands to
assist me and I entered into
contracts for the transportation
of large rafts of timber from Lake
Champlain to Troy

FORD

(TO TIBEATS)
Ill admit to being impressed even
if you wont

(TO SOLOMON)
Collect a gang see what good you
can do

76 76

EXT CREEK - DAY

-END OF JUNE 1841-

WE HAVE A SERIES OF SCENES in which we see Solomon anda
TEAM OF BLACKS working on the creek CHOPPING TREES
ALONG THE BANKS widening out the shore Its all just
a trial for now The work is diligent but it is basic
to this point Still under Solomons direction the
slaves go at it like theyve got something to prove And
rightly they do

Solomon also works on a narrow raft of twelve cribs with
which he will transport the timber

Once this is constructed HE PERSONALLY SAILS THEM UP

THE CREEK WITH A TEST LOAD

77°77
EXT FORDS WORK AREA - LATER

Ford and a group of slaves wait along the river banks
just beyond the WORK AREA All are expectant in their
manner A long moment passes with no sign of Solomon
Then from up river we see Solomons raft of lumber
winding its way SLAVES CHEER and Ford literally
applauds the effort Tibeats looks pissed He has just
been shown up after all

78 78
EXT FORD PLANTATIONGREAT HOUSE - DAY

As we come into the scene Ford is presenting Solomon
with a fiddle Not as grand as the one he previously
owned in New York but a fine instrument none the less
It is a gift of thanks for his hard work Solomons
gratitude is easily expressed

78 78

SOLOMON
My great thanks Master Ford

FORD
My thanks to you and it is the
least of it My hope is that it
brings us both much joy over the
years
Following the statement Solomons not sure how to react
He remains grateful but the thought of over the years
is just a reminder of the altered state in which he now
finds himself

EXT FORD PLANATIONSLAVE SHACK - EVENING

-END OF JULY 1841-

The slaves eat All tired from a days work they conduct
themselves in silence All except for Eliza who
SLIPPING INTO PERMANENT DEPRESSION as always weeps The
sound of her sobbing edging him up - particularly after
Master Fords over the years observation Solomon

FINALLY SNAPS

SOLOMON
Eliza Eliza stop
Solomon goes to her grabs Eliza She does not stop As
if to force the misery from her Solomon SHAKES ELIZA

VIOLENTLY
SOLOMON (CONTD)
Stop it Stop

ELIZA
Its all I have to keeps my loss
present

SOLOMON
You let yourself be overcome by
sorrow You will drown in it

ELIZA
Have you stopped crying for your
children You make no sounds but
will you ever let them go in your
heart

SOLOMON
They are as my flesh

79 79

ELIZA
Then who is distressed Do I
upset the Mistress and the Master
Do you care less for my loss than
their well being

SOLOMON
Master Ford is a decent man

ELIZA
He is a slaver

SOLOMON
Under the circumstances-—

ELIZA
Under the circumstances he is a
slaver Christian only in his
proclamations Separated me from
my precious babies for lack of a
few dollars But you truckle at

HIS BOOT--

SOLOMON
No

ELIZA
You luxuriate in his favor

SOLOMON
I survive I will not fall into
despair Woeful and crushed
melancholy is the yolk I see most
I will offer up my talents to
Master Ford I will keep myself
hearty until freedom is opportune

ELIZA
Ford is your opportunity Do you
think he does not know that you
are more than you suggest But he
does nothing for you Nothing
You are no better than prized
livestock Call for him Call
tell him of your previous
circumstances and see what it
earns youSolomon
Eliza uses Solomons name quite pointedly as if to
underscore his true self Solomon get her meaning Yet
he says nothing Again pointedly

ELIZA (CONTD)
So youve settled into your role
as Platt then

SOLOMON

ACCUSE ME--

I accuse you of nothing I cannot
accuse I too have done so many
many dishonorable things to
survive And for all of them I
have ended up here No better
than if I had stood up for myself

EXT FORD PLANTATION - MORNING

-AUGUST 1841-

Its Sunday The slaves are again gathered in the rose
garden near the front of the house to hear the word of
the Lord as read by Master Ford

FORD
And Jesus called a little child
unto him and set him in the midst
of them And said Verily I say
unto you Except ye be converted
and become as little children ye
shall not enter into the kingdom
of heaven
The phrase seems to trigger Elizas tears She begins to
sob uncontrollably
Mrs Ford turns to Rachel in a hushed whisper-

MRS FORD

I cannot have that kind of

depression about

Solomon pretending not to have heard slowly turns to
Eliza with worry

Ford continues to preach over Elizas keening

81 EXT FORD PLANTATION - DAY 81

-JANUARY 1842-

Seasons have passed It is winter now and very grey out
along the bayou Ford and Tibeats - who we have seen
working around the WORK AREA - stand with Solomon
Tibeats giving Solomon an inspection Ford carries much
lament

TIBEATS
Raise yer shirt
Solomon does as instructed Tibeats looks at Solomons
back at the scars from lashings he bears

TIBEATS (CONTD)
Troublesome

FORD
Hes a good carpenter and quick-
witted
TIBEATS
I am familiar with his cleverness

FORD
You wont find a nigger more
humble

TIBEATS
Aint found a nigger yet I caint
humble

Tibeats heads off Solomon highly curious over the
preceding

SOLOMON
Sir have I done something wrong

FORD
Not your concern Platt I say
with muchshame I have compiled
debts I have long preached
austerity but find myself
hypocritical in that regard
Youll be in the ownership of Mr
Tibeats You are his now Serve
him as youd serve me

SOLOMON
Sir
FORD
And your faithfulness will not be
forgotten

Loss of you is but one of my
punishments
82 82

EXT FORD PLANATION - DAY

-END OF JANUARY 1842- OVER ONE DAY

We see Solomon working as a carpenter helping to erect a
Weaving House that stands off to the side of the
plantations Great House

At the moment Solomon is nailing on siding Tibeats
arrives and is immediately dissatisfied with the work

TIBEATS
Make them boards flush

SOLOMON
They are sir

TIBEATS
They is no such thing
Solomon runs his hands over the boards

SOLOMON
As smooth to the touch as a
yearlings coat

TIBEATS
Callin me a liar boy

SOLOMON
Only a matter of perspective sir
From where you stand you may see
differently But the hands are
not mistaken I ask only that you
employ all your senses before
rendering judgement
Whats Tibeats to do when faced with fact All he can do
is spew invectives

TIBEATS
You are a brute You are a dog
and no better for followin
instruction

SOLOMON
Ill do as ordered sir

82 82

TIBEATS
Then youll be up at daybreak
You will procure a keg of nails
from Chapin and commence puttin
on clapboards
Tibeats wheels away Solomon goes back to his work
After a few moments Solomon notices a bit of commotion in
the drive of the great house It involves an
inconsolable Eliza who is being herded by Sam onto a cart
DRIVEN BY A WHITE MAN Mistress Ford and Rachel watch
Solomon can only watch as the last connection to his days
as a free man is driven away to a location unknown

83 83
EXT WEAVING HOUSE - MORNING

It is day break As ordered Solomon is up and working
Chapin is rolling a keg of nails off a handcart for
Solomon

CHAPIN
If Tibeats prefers a different
size I will endeavor to furnish
them but you may use those until
further directed

SOLOMON
Yes sir

84 84
EXT WEAVING HOUSE - LATER

As the day gets on to mid-morning the sun already baking
in the sky Tibeats makes his way over to Solomon Even
before arriving to Solomon his mien is one of
belligerence out of sorts and something less than sober
TIBEATS
I thought I told yah ta commence
ta puttin on clapboards this
morn’

84 84

SOLOMON
Yes master I am about it I
have begun on the other side of
the house
Tibeats walks around to look over Solomons work He is
Picayune as if purposefully looking for fault

TIBEATS
Didnt I tell yah last night to
get a keg of nails of Chapin

SOLOMON
And so I did and Chapin said he
would get another size for you if
you wanted them when he came back
from the field
Tibeats walks to the keg and kicks it Moving toward
Solomon with a great passion

TIBEATS
Goddamn yah I thought yah knowed
somethin
Solomon perhaps inspired by his moment with Eliza is in
no mood for Tibeats

SOLOMON
I did as instructed If theres
something wrong then its wrong
with your instructions

TIBEATS
Yah black bastard Yah goddman
black bastard

In an inconsolable rage Tibeats runs off to the piazza
to fetch a whip

Solomon looks around He is alone other than Rachel and
Mistress Ford who shocked by that which she witnesses
runs out to the field to fetch Chapin Solomons
instinct is to run but he stands his ground as Tibeats
marches back whip in hand

TIBEATS (CONTD)
Strip yer clothes
Solomon does no such thing

TIBEATS (CONTD)
Strip

SOLOMON
I will not
With concentrated vengeance Tibeats springs for
Solomon seizing him by the throat with one hand and

84 84
raising the whip with the other Before he can strike
the blow however Solomon catches Tibeats by the collar
of his coat and pulls him in close Reaching down
Solomon grabs Tibeats by the ankle and pushes him back
with the other hand Tibeats tumbles to the ground A
violent struggle takes place as Solomon puts a foot to
Tibeats throat and then in a frenzy of madness snatches
the whip from Tibeats and begins to strike him with the
handle again and again and again

TIBEATS
Yew will not live ta see another
day nigger This is yer last I
swear it
Solomon ignores the threats continues to beat Tibeats
Blow after blow falling fast and heavy on Tibeatss
wriggling form The stiff stock of the whip wraps around
Tibeatss cringing body until Solomons arm aches
Tibeatss cries of vengeance turn to yelps for help and
then pleas for mercy

TIBEATS (CONTD)
Murder Its murder Lord God
help me God be merciful
And then suddenly Tibeats shrieks-
TIBEATS (CONTD)
Papa Im sorry
Chapin comes RIDING IN FROM THE FIELD fast and hard
Solomon strikes Tibeats a blow or two more then delivers
a well-directed kick that sends Tibeats rolling over the
ground

CHAPIN
What is the matter
Tibeats struggles up and tries to present an air of
dignity and control while he keeps a demonic eye on

SOLOMON

SOLOMON
Master Tibeats wants to whip me
for using the nails you gave me

CHAPIN
Whats the matter with the nails
With a mix of shame anger and embarrassment Tibeats
says as if being exposed-

TIBEATS
Theyretheyre too large

CHAPIN
I am overseer here I told Platt
to use them and

(MORE)

84 84

CHAPIN (CONTD)
shall furnish such nails as I
please Do you understand that
Mr Tibeats
Tibeats answer is in the grinding of his teeth and the
shaking of his fist

TIBEATS

This aint done by half I will

have flesh and I will have all of

it

Tibeats moves off toward and then INTO THE HOUSE
Chapin follows A long moment Solomon stands alone He
looks around not sure what to do to stay or to flee

Anxiety mounts on his features

A moment more and Tibeats EXITS the house He saddles
his horse and rides off to beat the devil Or worse to
fetch him

Chapin comes running back out of the house He is

visibly excited and when he speaks he is quite earnest
Though he tries to project reasoned emotions he gives off
an air of impending trouble

CHAPIN
Do not stir Do not attempt to
leave the plantation on any
account whatever But if you run
there is no protecting you

SOLOMON
SIR--

CHAPIN
If you run Platt there is no
protecting you Rachel
Chapin runs off to join Rachel The two converse at a
distance from Solomon then they head off for the log
kitchen
Solomon is now very much alone and he waits for what is
to come AND WE WAIT WITH HIM And we wait and we
continue to wait Moment by moment the dread of the
unexpected mounts
Solomons eyes begin to well He has beaten a white man
and he knows that death awaits him

A SLIGHT PRAYER TO THE HEAVENS BEGINS TO FORM IN HIS
THROAT but he is too choked up to fully speak it

84 84
Chapin has now returned to the piazza He stands and
watches but does not move to Solomon
Solomon waits and waits
WE HEAR THE SOUND OF DISTANT HOOFS which grow louder and
louder in the manner of rolling thunder Its Tibeats
He returns with two accomplices RAMSAY and COOK They
carry with them large whips and a coil of rope

TIBEATS
Thas the one Thas him
Dismounting they move with menace that is tinged with
perverse pleasure and wordless malevolence Solomon
tries to fight back but he is strong armed and tied by
TIBEATS - his wrists and then ankles bound in the same
manner In the meantime the other two have slipped a
cord within Solomons elbows running it across his back
and tying it firmly Solomon is then dragged toward a
peach tree A lynching is in store The naked horror of
it intensely palpable
Solomon looks toward the piazza but Chapin is now gone
Tears of fear flow down Solomons cheeks He is on the
verge of panic a man heading toward his own execution
he begins to struggle and fight
A rope goes around Solomons neck then is tossed over
the branch of the tree The trio begin to hoist Solomon
He gasps and gags as spittle flies from his mouth and the
life is choked from him
With suddenness Chapin comes from the house brandishing
a pistol in each hand - Colt Paterson 36 caliber
Holster pistols with 9 barrels Chapin moves with
determination toward the lynch mob He is sharp and
matter of fact With the guns in hand he really doesnt
need to be much more demonstrative

CHAPIN
Gentlemen Whoever moves that
nigger another foot from where he
stands is a dead man I am
overseer of this plantation seven
years and in the absence of
William Ford my duty is to
protect his interests Ford holds
a mortgage on Platt of four
hundred dollars If you hang him
he loses his debt Until that is
canceled you have no claim to his
life
Directing his attention to Ramsay and Cook

84 84

CHAPIN (CONTD)
As for you two if you have any
regard for your own safetyI
say begone
Ramsay and Cook dont need to be told twice The pistols
Chapins gripping make the situation real clear Without
further word they mount their horses and ride away
Tibeats remains and his anger with him

TIBEATS
Yah got no cause Platt is mine
and mine ta do with as I please
Yah touch my property I will ‘ave
yah strung up as well
Tibeats mounts up and departs There is a surreal moment
as Chapins not sure what to do about Solomon He
chooses to do nothing Solomon is left dangling by the
neck from the tree as Chapin calls to Sam in the

DISTANCE

CHAPIN
Sam Get the mule You must ride
to Master Ford Tell him to come
here at once without a single
moments delay Tell him they are
trying to murder Platt Hurry
boy Bring him back if you must
kill the mule to do so

SAM
Yes suh
Sam mounts up and rides off the mule demonstrating much
speed

85 85
EXT FORD PLANATION - LATER

HOURS HAVE PASSED The sun is now at its apex The sight
and smell of the red rose bush is more than vivid as
Solomon remains tied and dangling exactly where he was
left The scene is both tranquil and horrific Life on
the plantation continues The OTHER SLAVES work in the
field CHILDREN make their way playfully in the yard
It should all underscore the fact that a black hanging
even partially from a tree is nothing unusual in this
time and space

85 85
Chapin walks back and forth with the pistols in his
hands Clearly he fears Tibeats returning with more and
better assistance And yet he does nothing to alleviate
Solomons suffering He heeds Tibeats words and as
though caught up in the middle of nothing more than a
property dispute he offers no further aid
Solomons head lolls to one side He looks toward the
sun The bright light flares off the leaves and branches
of the tree from which Solomon hangs The glare in
Solomons eyes offering him more pain than solace but he
cannot help but look upward As he does his eyes
flutter between life and lifelessness

86 86

OMIT

87 EXT FORD PLANATION - LATER 87

Solomon continues to hang By now he is drenched in
sweat and nearly delirious with dehydration His lips
dry and parched He may not die from hanging but he may
very well expire before the day is over

Eventually Rachel comes over - timidly and as though she
were acting contrary to orders - and offers a drink of
water from a tin cup pouring it in Solomons mouth for
him She then takes a small hand towel and dabs at the
water which clings to his lips Rachel then retreats

and leaves Solomon to hang
88 88
EXT FORD PLANATION - EVENING

The sun is just now arching for the horizon Solomon
remains as though his torture will not end Ford
trailed by Sam finally comes riding up He dismounts
and moves swiftly over to Solomon With great heartache

Ford produces a blade and cuts Solomon loose Solomon
attempts to carry himself but he cannot He falls to
the ground and passes out

89 89
INT FORD PLANATIONGREAT HOUSE - NIGHT

As we come into the scene Solomon lays on a blanket on
the floor Eventually his eyes flutter then open He

is in the foyer of the Ford house As he gets his
bearings he looks around the interior THE SPACE IS
HANDSOME AND WELL DECORATED It is sharp contrast to

the bleak surroundings shacks and dungeons Solomon has
largely been accustom to during his time of slavery It
will be the first and last time such a sumptuous resting
place was granted during his twelve years of bondage

89 89
Solomon doesnt have much chance to luxuriate in his
surroundings He hears a DOG BARKING just outside and
is unnerved Has Tibeats returned to finish what he
started
From a study Master Ford appears with a gun in hand He
goes to the door opens it and looks outside He can see
nothing Satisfied Ford crosses back over to Solomon
He is frank with Solomon regarding the situation

FORD
I believe Tibeats is skulkin
about the premises somewhere He
wants you dead and he will
attempt to have you so Its no
longer safe for you here And I
dont believe you will remain
passive if Tibeats attacks I
have transferred my debt to Edwin
Epps He will take charge of you

SOLOMON
(desperate urgent)
Master Ford you must know I am
not a slave

FORD
I cannot hear that

SOLOMON
Before I came to you I was a
freeman

FORD

I am trying to save your life
AndI have a debt to be mindful
of That now is to Edwin Epps
He is a hard man Prides himself
on being a nigger breaker But
truthfully I could find no others

moves out again to a wider shot This reveals several
lines of slaves picking cotton with Patsey way out in
the lead

We cut to another pair of black hands This time
revealing SOLOMON clumsy and unskilled hands picking
cotton A lash bears down on him

It is August cotton picking season

We are looking out over a cotton field in full bloom It
presents a visual purity like an immaculate expanse of
light new-fallen snow The cotton grows from five to
seven feet high each stalk having a great many branches

91 91
shooting out in all directions and lapping each other
above the water furrow
There is a slave to each side of the row They have a
sack around their necks that hangs to the ground the
mouth of the sack about breast high Baskets are placed
at the end of the furrows Slaves dump their sacks of
cotton in the baskets then pick until their sacks are
again filled

EDWARDS
Pick that cotton Move along now

THE SOUNDTRACK TO THE SCENE IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE

RUSTLE OF LABOR THE MALE CICADAS BUGS TYMBALS IN THE
HEAT and a SPIRITUAL SUNG BY THE SLAVES

Despite the heat there is no stopping for water The
slaves are driven by Edward who is himself driven by
Treach

the slaves dance They do so very wearily The whole of
it certainly more torture than pleasure

EPPS
Wheres yah merriment Move yer

As the slaves twirl about Epps keeps an attentive eye on
Patsey It should be quite clear that his primary
motivation for holding dances is so that he may view
Patsey twirl about the floor

This fact is not lost on Mistress Epps A few moments of
Eppss lust on display is all that the Mistress can bear
Jealousy mounting she snatches up a CARAFE With all
her might she throws it at Patsey It hits Patsey square
in the face TOO THICK TO SHATTER IT LEAVES HER BLOODY
AND WRITHING ON THE FLOOR The dancing the music stop

Mistress Epps stands irate lost in fury and unable to
even think of what to do Eventually optionless she
storms away

For a few beats there is only the sound of Patsey
sobbing

EXT ROAD - DAY

Solomon walks along a well-worn path shopping bag draped
over one shoulder We see his feet As the walk slowly
gathers pace Solomon suddenly turns left into dense
foliage His tread is now a full blown sprint trees
flash past as Solomon attacks his way through the woods
The sound of branches cracking underneath His feet
heartbeat and breath almost deafening He is desperate
The violence of his advance abruptly stops there is
silence We see in a clearance a posse of patrollers
preparing for a lynching of two young men Solomons
eyes meet theirs The two men look back at Solomon with
a look of fear as one of the patrollers checks the noose
around their neck Suddenly the bloodhounds start
barking and the patrollers turn in the direction of
Solomon Solomons whole body shakes with anticipation

PATROLLER

(AGGRESSIVELY)
Boy where are you going

SOLOMON
(almost tripping over

HIS WORDS)
To the store Sir to
Bartholomews I was sent there
by Mistress Epps
The patroller reaches out for Solomons free pass around
his neck yanking him forward He looks at it

PATROLLER
Get there and get there quick
The patroller kicks Solomon hard sending him on his way
Solomon walks on looking one more time at the two young
men again there is a moment of connection
Solomon turns The two men are hoisted up kicking and
spitting behind his shoulder
Solomon finds himself back on the trail walking towards
Bartholomews his face now full of shock and

Sitting on the Grand houses Piazza Patsey is having tea
with MISTRESS HARRIET SHAW WHO IS A BLACK WOMAN Though
once a slave she is now comparatively refined though not
wholly so The table where they sit is adorned with

white linens and they are attended by a HOUSE NIGGER

It makes for a tranquil surreal scene

MASTER SHAW A WHITE MAN IS ON THE LAWN GROOMING A
HORSE

Solomon is running flat out along the road Running as
though his life depended on getting to his destination in
beyond a timely manner

Solomon makes his way over to the piazza

SOLOMON
Excuse me Mistress Shaw

SOLOMON
Thank you Mistress but I dont

MISTRESS SHAW
Would you knowed Massa Eppss
consternation ta be any lessened

B105 B105
Solomon knows better but he sits and the Mistress has
tea poured for him

MISTRESS SHAW (CONTD)
Whatn was Eppss concern

SOLOMON
Id rather not say

MISTRESS SHAW
Lil gossip on the Sabbath be
fine All things in moderation
Solomon is not sure what to say He struggles to be as
diplomatic as possible

SOLOMON
As you are aware Master Epps can
be a man of a hard countenance
There are times when it is
impossible to account for his
logic You know he has ill
feelings toward your husband

MISTRESS SHAW
He do

SOLOMON

Master Epps has somehow come to
believe as incorrectly as it may
be that Master Shaw is That
he is something of a lothario and
an unprincipled man A misguided
belief born out of their mutual
competition as planters no doubt

MISTRESS SHAW
No doubtif not born outta truth
itself
The Mistress waves to Shaw Shaw unsuspecting of the
conversation waves back
SOLOMON
Im certain Patseys well being is
Master Eppss only concern

MISTRESS SHAW
Nothin Epps desire come outta
concern

SOLOMON
I meant no disrespect

MISTRESS SHAW
He aint heard you

broadcasting his affections
enjoyin his pantomime of
fidelity If that what keep me
from the cotton pickin niggers

reasonable price to be paid fo

Looking toward Patsey speaking with great empathy

MISTRESS SHAW (CONTD)
I knowed what it like to be the
object of Massas predilections
and peculiarities And I knowed

they can get expressed with

kindness or wit violence A lusty

visitation from the whip And wit

WOMAN commences to pour tea

As if to punctuate her thought the Mistress takes a sip
of her tea

as Patsey continues on Playing up his ignorance of

Solomon pulls away from Epps RIPPING HIS SHIRT IN THE
PROCESS Epps gives chase Solomon begins to run around
the large pig sty easily keeping his distance Epps
however is undeterred He moves after Solomon as
speedily as he can which isnt very speedily at all
And quickly he tires Epps is forced to bend over and
suck air Solomon maintains his distance barely
breathing hard His breath returned to him Epps starts
up the chase again Solomon runs on out of reach
Shortly Epps again stops gets his breath And now in
what should be quite comical Epps again runs after
Solomon Again Eppss vigor leaves him before he can
even get close to the slave
Dropping down to the dirt in a show of regret and piety

I admit that it did and I done
over reacted Its the Lords

Epps extends a hand to Solomon Cautiously Solomon
moves close but not too close As Solomon draws within
striking distance Epps lunges for him He chases
Solomon on until he is again out of breath and once more
drops down And again offering a treaty

EPPS (CONTD)
Im all done in Platt I have
met my limitations and I aint
equal to em I concede to yah
but in the name of valor help yer
master to his feet
Solomon cautiously moves closer to help Again he is
attacked by Epps - this time by knife Sort of Epps is
too drunk and tired to fully open the folding blade - and
chased far around the field by Epps ALL OF THE

PRECEDING SHOULD BE MORE FUNNY THAN SHOCKING A CHANGE
OF PACE FROM THE OTHERWISE NECESSARY BLEAKNESS OF SLAVE

LIFE
Mistress Epps comes running from the house to the pair

MISTRESS EPPS

SOLOMON
A misunderstanding is all It
began when I was sent to retrieve
Patsey from where shed taken
sabbatical at Master Shaws Upon
returning Master Epps believed
Patsey and me to be in

-AUGUST 1844-

With the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are
working the field picking cotton As before THEY SING A
SPIRITUAL the only thing that distracts them from the
tedium at hand

But there is no distracting from the heat We see Henry
begin to falter before it And eventually collapse
right in the dirt Though the other slaves take note
none move to help him None dare
From Treach rather matter of factly

TREACH
Get him water
Edward runs to fetch a gourd He carries it to Henry

DUMPS THE WATER ON HIM BUT DOES NOT ACTUALLY GIVE HENRY

ANYTHING TO DRINK
Roused Henry rights himself

from her apprehensive expression just what it is hes
come looking for This time there is no escaping it As
if to acknowledge the badness to come Phebe lightly
cries

EXT MASTER EPPSS PLANTATIONSMOKE HOUSE - NIGHT
On top of a wood pile in the back of the smoke house -
Epps shoves Patsey He stops stands as if gathering his
manhood then hes all over Patsey He is rough and
clumsy It looks like something between an awkward rape
and a virgin attempting his first sexual encounter
Patsey does not respond in any way other than to
continually turn her head from Epps but otherwise remain
as still as possible If there is such a thing she is
vicious with her passive aggressiveness

Eppss frustration mounts until - as the Mistress Shaw
had cautioned - he crosses the line from passion to
violence He begins slapping Patsey to get a response
from her When that fails he punches her which only
leads to him taking up his whip and lashing Patsey
MERCILESSLY Still she gives him nothing Beaten
Patsey sits in the dirt among the cotton Epps deep
breathing above her The desire for sex now having left
him

Epps heads from the field Patsey is left where she is

Mistress Epps brings out a tray of freshly baked
pastries She sets them down on a table

MISTRESS EPPS

The slaves thankful for the rest as much as the food
file toward the tray reciting a chorus of Thank you
Mistress As Patsey moves toward the pastries

MISTRESS EPPS (CONTD)

Patsey merely turns away Her non responsiveness
however serves only to incite the Mistress Screaming

Its an invitation for the Mistress to continue

if ever there was And if yah

wont stand for me Id pray youd

She moves quickly to Patsey DRIVES HER NAILS INTO THE

PATSEYS FACE AND DRAWS THEM DOWN ACROSS HER FEATURES

FIVE DEEP AND BLOODY GASHES ARE LEFT IN PATSEYS SKIN
the moment marked with appropriate screams Patsey
collapses on the floor covering her bleeding face

MISTRESS EPPS (CONTD)

Thoroughly cuckolded by the Mistresss actions Epps
takes his whip and pulls Patsey out of the house His
intentions are plain

displaying high satisfaction entreats the others

rather COTTON WORMS from the plants The cotton worms
have dined on the cotton and nearly destroyed the crop

INT SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT

118 118
Slaves are crammed into the shack - LITERALLY ON TOP OF
EACH OTHER - as they try to sleep Some lay some sit
up Packed in like cattle there is barely room to move
let alone draw a deep clean breath There is a real
risk of suffocating in the mass Some cough and wheeze

A CHILD CRIES

Among them is Solomon who must believe at this point that
his life has reached its very lowest point The odds of
survival are slight let alone the chance of actually
ever returning to his family This clearly weighs on him
as he struggles to find anything like comfortable space
in the pen

119 119
EXT CANE FIELDS - DAY
An OVERSEER is explaining to the new slaves - SOLOMON

AMONG THEM - how to cultivate cane WITH A KNIFE IN HAND
he demonstrates the process
OVERSEER
Draw the cane from the rick cut
the top and flags from the stalk
understand Leave only that part
which is sound and healthy Cast
off the rest

120 120

EXT CANE FIELDS - DAY

-NOVEMBER 1846-

ABOUT THIRTY SLAVES are working the field They are
divided into THREE GANGS The first which draw the cane
the next lay the cane in the drill the last then hoe the
rows after

Solomon is among a gang that draws and cuts and he moves
with speed and skill Certainly more so than he

displayed picking cotton

Standing with his overseer Judge Turner watches

121 121
INT SLAVE SHACK - NIGHT

Again the slaves have been herded into the shack and
pressed together

As he tries to rest - sleep is nearly impossible -
Solomon finds himself face to face with a woman ANNA
She is awake For a few beats she avoids eye contact
with Solomon She seems like Solomon to be
unaccustomed to her surroundings and horribly frightened
by them Eventually her eyes meet Solomons She makes
no sound but great apprehension spills from her eyes
Whatevers next whatever horror awaits she can barely
stand to face Fear proximity They drive her hand

81A
121 121

to Solomons After a moment of seemingly reacquainting
herself with genuine human contact the woman TAKES

121 121
SOLOMONS HAND AND PRESSES IT TO HER BREAST Solomon
tries to jerk his hand away but ANNA HOLDS IT IN PLACE
Manipulating Solomons hand she begins to massage her
breast Solomon takes no real pleasure in the act -
really neither does Anna THERE SHOULD BE A TRUE SENSE

ANNA IS JUST SO VERY VERY DESPERATE FOR HUMAN CONTACT
FOR THE NEED TO FEEL ALIVE AND LIKE A PERSON RATHER THAN
AN ANIMAL THAT EMOTIONALLY SHE IS WILLING TO ENGAGE

SOLOMON

The need quickly compounds Anna presses her lips to
Solomons Eventually SHE DIRECTS HIS HAND BENEATH HER
DRESS AND BETWEEN HER LEGS Solomon with slightly more
compassion than a guy making union wages BEGINS TO
MANIPULATE ANNA WITH HIS HAND The act remains more
perfunctory than passionate

We can see Anna moving toward climax and eventual
release But more - or substantially less - than joyous
sex it is really just a drug-like inoculation against
reality But the feeling quickly fades All that
remains as with most chance encounters is regret

And there is shame too This is put on display as Anna
turns away from Solomon As quickly as it began it is
as though the act had not happened at all

Like a dog shooed away Solomon steps down
Eventually Judge Turner exits the house and crosses to
Solomon

SOLOMON
-Sir

JUDGE TURNER
Platt is it Have you cultivated
cane previously

SOLOMON
No sir I have not

JUDGE TURNER
You take to it quite naturally
Are you educated

123 123

SOLOMON
Niggers are hired to work not to
read and write
Turner gives that a bit of consideration as he gives
Solomon a wary looking over

JUDGE TURNER
You play the fiddle

SOLOMON
I do

JUDGE TURNER

in a three weeks time I will
hold out your name to him What

kind of writing tool testing it in the mud He then
brushes over the dirt with his hand

Secreted away out near the edge of the bayou and sitting
by a small fire Solomon takes the slip of paper from his
fiddle It is yellowed showing age but still usable
Dipping the piece of cane - a quill - into the crushed
berries Solomon attempts to write a bit on the paper
The berry juice too free-flowing is unusable as ink
Solomon returns the paper to the fiddle He has some
scraps of food with him which he snacks on

We see a sharp object scratching onto a surface The

tool moves on to form another mark The sound is
repetitive and almost unbearable As we move out we see
the names Anne Margaret Alonzo They are engraved onto
the violin in the hidden area where Solomon would rest
his chin

Solomon looks at it for a moment moving his fingertips
across the engraving His face full of loss

Sadly he lifts his instrument under his chin and leaning
his head to the side as if to play

dance floor in fancy dress Their faces are covered with
a variation of decorative masks The party is a feast of
celebration As entertainment SOLOMON ACCOMPANIES A
GROUP OF MUSICIANS no more than three And as he does
so they all play with jovial liveliness Clearly a good
time is being had by all

EXT ROAD - NIGHT

His playing done for the evening Solomon is returning to
Judge Turners on foot There is only the moonlight with
which to light the way As he walks Solomon eats from a
HEARTY CHUCK OF BREAD Obviously part of his haul from
the evening Solomon again hears noises coming from the
brush just up ahead of him Solomon tears off some of

the bread kneels and holds it out before him

SOLOMON
Cmere Cmon boy

128 128
This time there is no dog Instead from the dark and
the brush step TWO BLACK MEN Solomon stands He looks
the men over - their clothes tatters and they themselves
covered in dirt It becomes quite clear they are not
just slaves A fact confirmed when they step menacingly
toward Solomon ONE WITH A SHIV IN HAND
At first it seems they want Solomons food or money
Worse THEY GO FOR HIS FIDDLE
Solomon has but a moment to brace himself before he is
attacked TAKING A CUT TO THE ARM Solomon fights back
PICKING UP A PINE KNOT and striking his attacker over the
head That takes the fight out of him and both men
retreat back the way they came leaving Solomon be

130 EXT TURNER PLANTATION - NIGHT 130

-FEBRUARYMARCH 1847-

Alone out on the edge of the Bayou Solomon is playing a

low air on his violin WHILE SNACKING ON SCRAPS OF BACON

As he plays something appears in the distance From the

edge of the bayou coming forth like an apparition arisen
from the earth is CELESTE She is a young woman of

about 19 years of age and far whiter than most blacks

IT REQUIRED CLOSE INSPECTION TO DISTINGUISH IN HER
FEATURE THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF AFRICAN BLOOD Beyond
that she is pale and haggard but still lovely
Dressed in a white gown she emerges from the water
Draped on her dress her period A line in her skirt
Its very visible but not shocking A ribbon of red in
her dress

Celeste moves to Solomon without fear or hesitation As
Solomon startled takes her in Celeste says quite

PLAINLY
CELESTE
I am hungry Give me food

SOLOMON
Who are you

CELESTE
Im hungry
Solomon gives Celeste some of his food Celeste
famished devours it

SOLOMON
What is your name

CELESTE
My name is Celeste

SOLOMON
What are your circumstances

CELESTE
I belong ta Massa Carey and ave
been two days among da palmettoes
Celeste is sick and caint work
and would rather die in the swamp

than be whipped to death by the
overseer So I took myself away
Massas dogs wont follow me The
patrollers ave tried to set dem
on me But dey a secret between
dem and Celeste and dey wont
mind the devilish orders of the
overseer
Celeste lifts her head from the food on which she gnaws
CELESTE (CONTD)
Do you believe me

SOLOMON
Yes

CELESTE
Why

SOLOMON

There are some whose tracks the
hounds will refuse to follow

CELESTE
Give me more food Im starvin

SOLOMON
This is all my allowance for the

REST OF--

CELESTE
Give it to me
Almost as if compelled Solomon does as ordered As
eats Celeste aggrandizes herself

CELESTE (CONTD)
Most slaves escape at night The
overseers are alert for such
chicanes But Celeste tricked dem
n alight in the middle of the day
wit the sun up at its highest
The place of my concealment now
deep in the swamp not half a mile
from Massas plantation anda
world apart A world a tall
trees whose long arms make fo a
canopy so dense dey keep away even
the beams of the sun It twilight
always in Celestes world even in
the brightest day I will live
there and I will live freely
The overseers are a cowardly lot
Dey will not go where their dogs
show fear and where it always be
night Others will join me in the
twilight and we aint gunna be
slaves no mo forever

she
130 130
Solomon isnt sure what to say Before he can say

ANYTHING

CELESTE (CONTD)
Celeste will come to you again in
the night You will have food for
her
Celeste departs the way she came as though she were a
vision

131 131
INT JUDGE TURNERS PLANTATIONFOOD STORAGE - NIGHT

Solomon stealthfully makes his way into the storage shed
Dried and smoked meats are hung and milled corn is
about Taking out a handkerchief Solomon begins to load
it with food Not too much Not so much his thievery
will be readily noticed but he does avail himself

132 132
EXT TURNER PLANTATION - NIGHT

Solomon plays his violin but plays it with an anxious
nature as he waits

Then as before a figure appears in the distance It is
Celeste coming out of the night She makes her way
directly to Solomon With no greeting she says

CELESTE
I am hungry
Solomon gives Celeste the handkerchief hes filled She
opens it and begins to devour the food As she eats

CELESTE (CONTD)
I was rude and didnt even ask yo
name

SOLOMON
Platt

(BEAT)
Solomon Solomon is my true and
free name
CELESTE
Was you free

SOLOMON
I was I am
Solomon exposes his wrist displays his tattoo as he

ANNOUNCES

SOLOMON (CONTD)
I remain free in my heart

132 132
Giving a laugh as though its the silliest thing shes

HEARD

CELESTE
Free heart means nothin ifn yo
body gunna die a slave

SOLOMON
I will not

CELESTE
How Celeste knows you aint
gunna run Celeste knows it aint
your nature

SOLOMON
I have a plan I have a letter

CELESTE
A letter Howll yah mail da
letter Who yah trust to post it
A nigger that can read and write
is a nigger thatll hang
There is a pause Solomon cant answer this question
is the glaring hole in his plan
Having finished eating

It

132 132
CELESTE (CONTD)
Celeste will come again in de

night You will bring her mo
food

You will bring Celeste mo food
And with that Celeste again moves back into the darkness

Solomon is picking at the bark off a WHITE MAPLE

136 EXT TURNER PLANTATION - EVENING 136

In a tin cup over a fire Solomon boils the white maple
bark in just a bit of water

137 INT JUDGE TURNERS PLANTATIONSLAVES CABIN - NIGHT 137

As others sleep by the light of dying coals Solomon
uses the quill to test the boiled bark The liquid holds
as a form of ink It is not ideal but it is legible on
the page Armed with this Solomon writes his letter

138 138
EXT TURNER PLANTATION - NIGHT
Solomon sits with Celeste He relates his news to her

SOLOMON
I have my letter

CELESTE
Yah has your freedom then

SOLOMON
All that remains is to contrive
measures by which the letter can
safely be deposited in the post
office
When Celeste speaks she is quite melancholy

( )

138 138
CELESTE
I have resolved to return to my
Massa

Solomon gives an unnerved look This is not good news

SOLOMON
Is it more food you need

CELESTE
I live in fear

SOLOMON
None will come after you in the
swamps

CELESTE
It aint the patrollers I scared
of At all seasons the howling
of wild animals can be heard at
night along the border of the
swamps At first their calls were
welcomin Dey too was free n I
thought dey greeted me like a
sistah Lately dey cries have
turned horrifyin They mean to
kill Celeste

SOLOMON
The solitude plays tricks Its
your impression nothing more If
you go back to your master you
could face the same

CELESTE
My freedom been nothin but a
daydream So was Celestes
thoughts of slaves conjoinin in
the bayou

SOLOMON
Better the loneliness You have
been free most of the summer
Return now and your master will
make example of you

CELESTE
It is lonely dwellin waiting for
others who wont never come

( )

138 138
SOLOMON
Go north Make your way by
night
CELESTE

Itll only be worse ifn Celeste
dont go back of her own will

SOLOMON
You wont be caught The dogs
wont track you You areyou
are unique Celeste

CELESTE
You got alternatives Solomon

SOLOMON
To return is to die

CELESTE
Celeste got no one to write a
letter to
As if to punctuate her resolve without a word more
Celeste departs toward the swamp Solomon starts on into
the swamp after her

SOLOMON

Celeste Celeste

Solomon continues after Celeste wading deeper into the
dark night and murky waters

SOLOMON (CONTD)

Celeste I will guide you north

Wait and I will take you

Celeste is too nimble She outpaces Solomon continues
on and disappears into the night

SOLOMON (CONTD)
Let me take you Let me go with
you
Solomon runs on then splashes to a stop He stumbles
around disoriented calling into the blackness

SOLOMON (CONTD)

Celeste

Nothing No answer Not a human one There are sounds
and echoes - some in the distance some perhaps moving
closer - which moment by moment become more and more

frightening Soon Solomon realizes he is in quite
literally over his head the water first chest deep then
neck deep With no way to orient himself no means to
guide him in the dark Solomons reserve begins to
crumble He thrashes in the water trying to find his way

138 138
back to shore No longer trying to save Celeste Solomon
calls to her - desperately - for assistance

SOLOMON (CONTD)
Celeste Come to me Celeste
In that moment Solomon is quite certain he is nearly
done that he will not find land nor aid and that this
is his final moment His panic should be that tangible
It is either force of will or survival instinctor
maybe just pure luck that carries Solomon on until he
reaches first muddy ground then firm footing Hauling
himself onto the swamps edge Solomon finally collapses
in a drenched worn heap His life spared but Celeste
never to be seen again

EXT EPPSS PLANTATION - DAY

-MAYJUNE 1847-

We come up now outside of Master Eppss plantation Epps
stands in the drive Hes in surprisingly good spirits
as Solomon Uncle Abram Henry and Bob trudge their way
wearily toward Epps and his other slaves who are
gathered

The cotton field is in full bloom the crop fully
returned

EPPS
A joyous day A joyous day Dark
times is behind us Clean livin
n prayer done lifted the plague
Indicating to the cotton

(TO SOLOMON)
Heard Judge Turner gave you favor
Oh did you beguile him Platt
with your slick nigger ways
Well yah wont stand idle boy
Not on my land Much work to do

Days of old long since eh

Joyous Joyous indeed

Throughout Eppss welcome Solomons focus is on Patsey
who is lined up with the other slaves SHE IS NOW MORE
HAGGARD THAN WHEN WE LAST SAW HER Her face and arms
display many new scars Its clear that in the
intervening years she has quite literally been a whipping
boy for Epps and the Mistress

-JULY 1847-

The slaves are out working on the field White hands
appear picking cotton ARMSBY He is wholly unskilled at
picking cotton and he puts little effort into the job
As we meet him he seems a decent sort if a little short
on self-motivation In anachronistic terminology hed

be called a Slacker He joins in with the slaves
singing a spiritual

awaits his fate

TREACH
Sixty four pounds
Epps speaks to Armsby sternly but nothing of the manner
in which he would address the slaves

141 141

EPPS
A good days labor would average
two hundred pounds

ARMSBY
Yes sir

EPPS
Im sure in time yll develope as
a picker but it takes effort
boy Put some damn effort into

No force is needed The slaves understand the situation
They follow Treach out of the Gin house

EXT EPPSS PLANTATIONSLAVE SHACK - NIGHT

We come in after the punishment has been dealt Patsey
tends to Uncle Abrams back as Armsby applies liniments
to Solomons As he does Armsby muses

ARMSBY
Its a tragedy How does such
come to pass Working a field and
picking cotton like a lowly hand
Im of a damn sight better
station And my desires never
lacked for a grandiose component
though I will admit they have at
times been short on ingenuity
But only at times Ive worked as
an overseer you know

SOLOMON
I did not sir

ARMSBY
Not sir Just Armsby Not owed
more than any other in the field
I worked plantations from
Virginia down into Alabama I
could manage easy a hundred slaves
and have done so But to toil in
the field Never thought that
would come to pass Never But
times are desperate Where once I
had said no to Epps and his
merger offerings I returned cap

SOLOMON
How did you arrive at such a
place if I may ask

ARMSBY
Ask Its just conversation
From a pocket Armsby produces a flask

ARMSBY (CONTD)
I became a little too dependant on
the whisky a little too
undependable on the job Before
you say Im just a sorry drunkard
let me state my case As reliable
employment as overseeing is its
no easy chore on the spirit I
say no man of conscious can take
the lash to another human day in
and day out without shredding at
his own self Takes him to a
place where he either makes
excuses within his mind to be
unaffected Or finds some way
to trample his guilty sensations
Well I trampled
Armsby takes a drink

ARMSBY (CONTD)
And with frequency

SOLOMON
Where is your place of birth

ARMSBY
Maryland Have you traveled
there

SOLOMON

I cannot say that I have

ARMSBY
Fine country More seasonal than
the bayou A deal less humid

SOLOMON
Why did you leave it

To make my fortune of course I
gave in to tales of wealth and
prosperity that were the lore of

needed being a patch of land anda

proper bank in which to store your
riches But such profitable
outcomes are reserved for the
plantation masters Its the lot
of the rest of us to serve So I
settled on being an overseer and
failed as well at that In the
meantime my dreams gave way to
reality Now I want nothing more
than to earn a decent wage

And get myself home

-AUGUST 1847-
We again hear the sound of the HORN BLOWING signaling the
start of the work day for the slave

144 EXT MASTER EPPSS PLANTATIONFIELD - DAY 144

With the sun yet again high in the sky the slaves are
working the field picking cotton As before they sing a
spiritual the only thing that distracts them from the
tedium at hand

But there is no distracting from the heat We see Uncle
Abram begin to falter and finally drop down to the
ground

Treach calls to Edward
TREACH
Get him water
Edward runs to fetch water which he carries to Abram and

DUMPS ON HIMBUT ABRAM DOES NOT RISE DOES NOT MOVE
At this point the sounds of the singing from the others
tapers off as they realize Abram isnt getting up

EXT MASTER EPPSS PLANTATIONSLAVE CEMETERY - LATER

We are beyond the main of the plantation the cotton
field in the background We are at the slaves cemetery
a mixture of crude crosses and unsettled ground

Solomon Bob and Henry now much visually older than when
we first saw them are digging a grave in the dirt The
uncovered body of Abram lays near Having dug down an
appropriate distance the three men take the body and
very unceremoniously place it into the ground Holding

145 145
the shovel in his hands and resting it by his feet Bob
tilts his head down and closes his eyes The others do
the same Almost stutteringly not really knowing what to

SAY--

BOB
I just want to say something about
Uncle Abram He was a good man and
he always looked out for us since
we were little God Bless him God
love him And God keep him

the more of a funeral that Abram will receive

COINS

SOLOMON
The proceeds of my fiddling
performances A few picayunes
but all I have in the world I
promise them to you if you will do
me the favor I require But I beg
you not to expose me if you cannot
grant the request

ARMSBY
What do you ask

SOLOMON
First your word sir

ARMSBY
On my honor

SOLOMON
It is a simple enough request I
ask only that you deposit a letter
in the Marksville post office
And that you keep the action an
inviolable secret forever The
details of the letter are of no
consequence Even at that there
would be an imposition of much
pain and suffering were it known I
was the author A patron is what
I require sir

ARMSBY
Wheres the letter now

SOLOMON
It is not yet written I will
have it in a day Two at most my
skill with composition as poor as
it is
Armsby considers the request

ARMSBY
I will do it And will accept
whatever payment is offered
Solomon hesitates In the moment hes not so sure he
can wholly give himself over to trust

150 150

To assist you I put my own self
at risk I will do so but fair
compensation is all I ask

conspicuously NOT laboring in the field As Solomon
works he is watched by Epps Watched more than he
normally is For a moment it seems it might just be a
matter of perspective Solomons unease over his actions
But soon Epps is joined by Armsby The two men stand and
talk their looks locked toward Solomon

Whatever it is that is occurring between them continues
for a long long moment But Epps makes no move toward
Solomon Solomon continues with his work

says nothing but his directive is clear Follow me

shadows is a bitter Epps Despite the lack of light

I had one that needed close
watchin or he would run away
When I axed him why he said you
come over to him and waked him up
in the middle of the night and
wanted him to carry a letter to
Marksville What have yah got to
say to that

All I have to say master is all
that need be said There is no
truth in it

constant in truth Now master I
can see what that Armsby is after
plain enough Didnt he want you
to hire him for an overseer

Thats it He wants to make you
believe were all going to run
away and then he thinks youll
hire an overseer to watch us He
believes you are soft soap Hes
given to such talk I believe
hes just made this story out of
whole cloth cause he wants to
get a situation Its alla lie
master you may depend ont Its
all a lie
For a tense moment we are unsure which way Eppsll go
Increasingly it become apparent that shallow minded and
equally soused Solomon has been able to fold Eppss
thoughts In a low curse that clearly states his ill
intentions

153 153
Revealed is a pocket knife which all through the
conversation unknown to us the audience was pushed up
against Solomons stomach As Epps speaks he closes it
and taps it on Solomons shoulder

ashes descend into the night sky

possessed fond of argument but always speaking with
extreme deliberation as well as a Canadian accent
B155 B155
EXT MASTER EPPSS PLANTATIONGREAT HOUSE - DAY

As the slaves continue to work there is a conversation
going on between Epps and Bass Bass much skilled in the
art of sophistry while Eppss arguments are fueled
mostly by emotion alone Though at first Epps does
little more than joke his way around the facts

Solomon working still cant help but overhear as Epps
offers Bass a drink which Bass waves away

Of course you did The law says
you have the right to holda

pardonit lies Is everything
right because the law allows it
Suppose theyd pass a law taking
away your liberty and making you a
slave

EPPS
Ha

BASS
Suppose

EPPS

That aint a supposable case

BASS
Because the law states that your
liberties are undeniable Because
society deems it so Laws change
Social systems crumble Universal
truths are constant It is a
fact it is a plain fact that what
is true and right is true and
right for all White and black
alike

well ask what the difference is

Epps goes to strike Solomon but Patsey pulls his arm
back

PATSEY
Do not strike him I went to
Massa Shaws plantation
EPPS
Yah admit it

PATSEY
Freely And you know why
Patsey takes soap from the pocket of her dress

PATSEY (CONTD)
I got this from Mistress Shaw
Mistress Epps wont even grant me
no soap ta clean with Stink so
much I make myself gag Five
hundred pounds a cotton day in
day out More than any man here
And fo that I will be clean that
all ax Dis here what I went to
Shaws fo

EPPS
You lie

PATSEY
The Lord knows thats all

EPPS

You lie

PATSEY
And you blind wit yer own
covetousness I dont lie Massa
If you kill me Ill stick ta
that

EPPS
Ill learn you to go to Shaws
Treach go get some line

156 156
Treach runs quickly to the tool shed In short order he
returns with the rope in hand

EPPS (CONTD)
Strip her Strike her bare n
lash her to the post
Mistress Epps has now come from the Great House She
gazes on the scene with an air of heartless satisfaction
Now tied to the post Epps stands behind Patsey with his
whip
EPPS (CONTD)
Yah done this to yerself Pats
Epps hoists the whip to strike holds it highbut no
matter his rage Epps cannot bring himself to deliver the
blow He looks to Mistress Epps who now stands gloating
and spurring him on

MISTRESS EPPS
Do it Strike the life from her
Epps again hoists the whip It trembles in his hand
ahead of the act But he does not have it in him to
deliver such a beating Turning to Solomon thrusting
the whip at him

EPPS
Beat her
Solomon doesnt move Epps shoves the whip into his
hand

EPPS (CONTD)
Give her the whip Give it all to
her
Patsey begging to Solomon

PATSEY
Id rather it you Platt

EPPS
Strike her or yahll get the
same
( )

156 156
Solomon takes a step back He unfurls the whip He
begins to whip Patsey Lash after lash Patsey squirms
before it Epps eyes fill with tears he is nearly too
distraught to watch
But the Mistress She is not satisfied with Solomons
half-hearted effort
MISTRESS EPPS
He pantomimes There aint barely
a welt on her Thats what your
niggers make of yah a fool fer
the takin
Eppss grief is replaced by fury EPPS GRABS THE PISTOL
FROM TREACHS HOLSTER and draws down on the slaves

EPPS
Yah will strike her Yah will
strike her until her flesh is rent
and meat and blood flow equal or
I will kill every nigger in my
sight
Solomon cant strike a blow even if it means his life
But from the ground from Patsey

PATSEY
Do it Platt Dont stop until I
am dead
What else can he do Solomon begins to whip to truly
whip Patsey Her back welts then tears Patsey

screams in agony Solomon strikes again and again
After a full thirty lashes Solomon looks to Epps who is
not satisfied

EPPS
Until I say no more I aint said
nothing
Solomon strikes another ten to fifteen times By now as
promised Patseys back has been reduced to LITTLE MORE

THAN TORN MEAT AND BLOOD
Finally Solomon holds low the whip He can and will do
no more

EPPS (CONTD)
Strike her Strike her
Solomon will not Epps takes up the whip and whips
Patsey with ten fold greater force than he had The
painfully loud and angry curses of Epps load the air
Patsey by now is terribly lacerated literally flayed
The lash wet with blood which flowed down her sides and
dropped upon the ground At length Patsey ceases
struggling Her head sinks listlessly on the ground

156 156
Her screams and supplications gradually decrease and die
away into a low moan It would seem that she was dying
Solomon screaming at Epps

SOLOMON
Thou devil Sooner or later
somewhere in the course of eternal
justice thou shalt answer for this
sin
Though Epps fronts rage there should be underlying
anguish for what he has done to his beloved Pats

EPPS
No sin There is no sin A man
does how he pleases with his
property At the moment Platt I
am of great pleasure You be
goddamn careful I dont come to
wantin to lightenin my mood no
further
By contrast to this horror the field of cotton smiles in
the warm sunlight The birds chirp merrily amidst the
foliage of the tress Peace and happiness seems to reign
everywhere
Everywhere else
Epps leaves Patsey to herself He says not a word to the
Mistress as he passes The Mistress herself heads back
into the house
Solomon unties Patsey lifts her and takes her to the
cabin

157 157
INT CABIN - LATER

Patsey is laid on some boards where she remains for a
long time with eyes closed and groaning in agony Phebe
applies melted tallow to her wounds and all try to
assist and console her

In time Patsey opens her eyes She looks to Solomon
She does not say a word She just looks at himand
then her eyes close again

EVENING

-APRIL 1852-

Solomon and Bass are working together alone on the
extension From the amount of work thats been done on
it it should be obvious that days have now passed
Solomon makes a cautious approach to Bass As casually
as he can he inquires

SOLOMON
Master Bass I want to ask you
what part of the country you came
from

BASS
No part of this land I was born
in Canada Now guess where that
is

SOLOMON
Oh I know where Canada is I
have been there myself

BASS
Have you

SOLOMON
Montreal and Kingston and
Queenston and a great many places
And I have been in York state
too Buffalo and Rochester and
Albany and can tell you the names
of the villages on the Erie canal
and the Champlain canal
Bass gives Solomon a long and curious stare

BASS
Well traveled for a slave How
came you here
SOLOMON
Master Bass if justice had been
done I never would have been here

BASS
Hows this Tell me all about it

SOLOMON
I am afraid to tell you though I
dont believe you would tell
Master Epps if I should

BASS
Every word you speak is a profound
secret

Hours have passed Bass reflects on the story that Epps
has told in the intervening

BASS
How many years all told

SOLOMON
Just nearlyjust passed eleven

BASS
Your story isit is amazing and
in no good way

SOLOMON

Do you believe sir in justice as
you have said

BASS
I do

SOLOMON
That slavery is an evil that
should befall none
BASS
I believe so

SOLOMON
If you truly do I would askI
would beg that you write my
friends in the north acquainting
them with my situation and
beseeching them to forward free
papers or take such steps as they
might consider proper to secure my
release
Bass looks at Solomon holding his gaze for more than a
prolonged beat

SOLOMON (CONTD)
My daughter Margaret is possibly
now 19 and my son Alonzo 16 I
miss them so It would be an
unspeakable happiness to clasp my
wife and my family again
Bass hands Solomon an end of a long plank of wood and
looks over his shoulder as if to camouflage the
conversation by work They both lift it toward the
floorboards Finally Bass speaks

161 161

BASS
I have always forgone
relationships and family I did
once have a sweetheart who I loved
deeply
Bass points to a measuring tool which Solomon
immediately hands over

BASS (CONTD)
But that was a long long time
ago Ive been traveling this
country for the best part of
twenty years My freedom is
everything The fact that I can
walk out of here tomorrow gives me
most pleasure I see the aching in
your eyes the pain of not being
attached to your loved ones My
life doesnt mean much to anyone
but it seems your life means a lot
to a lot of people What you have
just said to me scares me and I
must say sir I am afraid Not
just for you but for me

They continue working fixing the floorboards in unison
Solomon slightly confused

BASS (CONTD)
will write your letter sir for
if I could bring freedom to you
it will be more than a pleasure
t will be a duty Now would you
be so kind as to pass me those
nails sir
We pull back to reveal the two men dwarfed by the
unfinished structure They continue to work as if the
conversation had never occurred

-SEPTEMBER 1852-

SLOW DISSOLVE
To a now virtually complete half-painted white gazebo
Slaves continue to work on it As they do so Bass peels
away from the structure to have an overview He beckons
Solomon toward him out of earshot from the slaves who
are continuing to work on the gazebo As Solomon
approaches Bass shouts-

BASS
And bring those markers
Solomon gathers a clutch of markers in his hands and
approaches Bass

BASS (CONTD)
No letter yet

SOLOMON
You are certain
Bass takes a marker from Solomon and slides it into the
earth

BASS
I have inquired thoroughly More
than is safe for either of us
Bass takes another and pokes it into the ground
improvising a pathway towards the gazebo

BASS (CONTD)
SolomonI have a job or two on
hand which will be completed
shortly The work here has
grown sparse

165 165
Bass doesnt need to spell things out for Solomon
Solomons understanding of the finality of the situation
should be very clear

BASS (CONTD)
You must know wherever I am I
will press your cause

SOLOMON
Five months On top of these
years No cause remains

BASS
If there is any chance

SOLOMON
Mr Bass

BASS
I will continue to write your

PEOPLE--

SOLOMON
Go home knowing you have tried
The weight of defeat should hang very heavily with both
men Nothing more to do nothing more to say BASS TAKES

SOLOMONS HAND GRIPS IT FIRMLY BUT LOW AND
SURREPTITIOUSLY knowing full well he cannot be seen
making contact with a slave But in the strength of
their collective grip in the emotion in which they hold
each others eyes we should be able to easily see how
greatly Bass wanted to be able to help Solomon Equally
we can see the depth of regard Solomon has for Bass The
moment is made all the more powerful by the fact neither
man can openly speak his regret or thanks A moment
longer and then Bass releases his grip and makes his
way marching toward the gazebo pointing instructions
Solomon is left markers in hand alone

A168 EXT ROAD BY EPPS PLANTATION - EVENING A168

Solomon sits on a secluded part of the road fiddle in
hand He stares across the expanse His eyes fixed on
something that is a million miles away

Slowly Solomon tunes his fiddle turning the tuning peg
tighter and tighter As the strings are taut the sound
is almost unbearable as Solomon tightens bit by bit as
if bones are being cracked one by one Just beyond the
breaking point of sound there is a snap

He then repeats the action

Solomon holds the neck of the violin Sliding his thumb
and forefinger down the neck he methodically cracks it
at the base He carefully snaps the neck and removes it
from the body then snaps it in two placing it on the
ground

He then starts on the body Heaving it on the ground it
falls apart Methodically he breaks the violin into small
bits - silencing the instrument with a hushed display of
violence rather than aggressive Seems almost to be in
an odd way respectful

EXT MASTER EPPSS PLANTATIONFIELD - DAY

-FEBRUARY 1853-

The Slaves are sewing the heavily plowed field making
their way in the trying soil Solomon too focused to
note the arrival of two men by carriage Parker and the

SHERIFF
While the Sheriff makes his way to the field Parker
remains with the carriage The Sheriff calls
SHERIFF
Platt Where is the boy called
Platt

SOLOMON
Sir
The Sheriff crosses to him

SHERIFF
Your name is Platt is it

SOLOMON
Yes sir
Pointing off to the distance

SHERIFF
Do you know that man

118A

168 168
Solomon looks toward the carriage He has to shield his
eyes from the sun Recognition is slow coming to him
But when it does it hits him as a rush

SOLOMON
Mr Parker

( )

168 168
Solomon starts for Parker but he is pulled back by the

Sheriff who is keen to determine Solomons true identity

SHERIFF
Say again
SOLOMON
Mr Parker
As he does Epps makes his way over

SHERIFF
That man received a letter
compiling many accusations You
look me in the eye and on your
life answer me truthfully have
you any other name than Platt

SOLOMON
Solomon Northup is my name

EPPS
Sheriff

SHERIFF
Have you a family

EPPS
Whats all this

SHERIFF
Its official business

EPPS
My nigger my business

SHERIFF
Your business waits

(TO SOLOMON)
Tell me of your family

SOLOMON
I have a wife and two children

SHERIFF
What were your childrens names

SOLOMON
Margaret and Alonzo

SHERIFF
And your wifes name before her
marriage

SOLOMON

Anne Hampton I am who I say
Solomon pushes past the sheriff As Solomon moves toward
Parker his pace quickens with each step until his

119A

168 168
personal velocity has him nearly at a dead run The two
old friends make contact with each other wrap each other
in a long and emotional embrace It if finally broken by
Epps who has moved over with the Sheriff

( )

168 168
EPPS
Nah You will unhand em

Platt is my nigger

PARKER
He is Solomon Northup

EPPS
You say

PARKER
He belongs to no man

EPPS
You say You come here
unfamiliar to me and make claims

SHERIFF
Not claims I have no doubts
This is Solomon Northup a
resident of Saratoga Springs NY

EPPS
To hell with that My nigger and
Ill fight you for em

PARKER
As is your right As it will be

my pleasure to bankrupt you in the

courts Your decision

By this time the slaves in the plantation have overcome
their fear of penalty and left their work and gathered
in the yard as witnesses They stand behind the cabin
out of sight of Epps

Mistress Epps also bears witness standing on the veranda
next to her house slave Her face is of a strange mixed
emotion

Epps looks to Solomon Solomon icily stoically holds
his ground He makes it quite clear in his countenance
that nobody owns him Sheriff hand on his gun is there
to back Solomon up Epps with no other recourse than to

BACK DOWN

EPPS
You think this is the last youll
see of me boy It aint

(TO PARKER)
Whatever paper you hold about his
freedom it dont mean naught He
is my nigger - and I will have my
day in court sir As God as my
witness I will have my day in
court Take em
Epps calls to Bob-

120A

EPPS (CONTD)
Saddle my horse And bring her up
here
Epps walks back into the plantation
The trio starts for the carriage Solomon is pulled back
by the call of Patseys voice

PATSEY
Platt
Disregarding Parker Solomon crosses over to Patsey
Under the circumstances neither really knows how to
engage Finally suddenly Patsey throws her arms around
Solomon and they embrace
Epps now mounted on his horse witness the encounter
Kicking the stirrups hard into the sides of the horse he
rides off furiously
Calling from the carriage mindful of Epps

PARKER
Solomonif we know whats wise
we should depart
A moment longer Solomon and Patsey hold each other They
separate Solomon heading back to the carriage He and
Parker alight The Sheriff chides the horses and they

168 168
start up As they move on Patsey sinks down to the
ground where she remains in a weary and half-reclining
state the other slaves around her
WE STAY WITH Solomon as he travels further and further
from the slaves - who are diminished by distance
Solomon waves a hand to them but the carriage rounds a
bend and a thicket of trees hides them from his eyes
forever more

EXT NORTHUP HOUSE - DAY

-MARCH 1853-

We now see Solomon in front of a door A door we have
seen before at the very beginning of our story Solomon
aged significantly since then stands nervously
swallowing and adjusting his attire He breaths in and
holds his breath He blows out and closes his eyes A
tear falls from his cheek but this is not the way he
wants his family to see him He gathers himself and
looks to his right There stands Mr Parker He places
his hand on Solomons shoulder He says gently-
PARKER
Are you ready
Solomon swallows and nods

169 169
INT NORTHUP HOUSE - LATER

THE DOOR TO THE ROOM OPENS Mr Parker enters Solomon
behind We first see Anne in her finest attire the
Northup children Alonzo who is now seventeen and
Margaret who is now twenty - SHE CARRIES WITH HER A
BUNDLE Also present is MARGARETS HUSBAND The family
waits patiently dutifullybut anxiously

Anne rises to greet him but holds back All around the
body language of the family is stiff and awkward They
are after all - after twelve years - little more than
familiar strangers

SOLOMON
I apologize for my appearance I
have had a difficult time of
things these past many years
Solomon looks among his family trying to recall them as
much as they look to see familiarity within him To his

CHILDREN

SOLOMON (CONTD)
Alonzo Margaret yes You do
not recognize me do you Do

SOLOMON (CONTD)
youdo you even remember the
last time we saw each other I
put you on a carriage with your
mother
Margaret tearing hugs her father Solomon almost
breaks but he keeps himself together Looking to the

UNKNOWN MAN

SOLOMON (CONTD)
And who is this

MARGARET
He is my husband

SOLOMON
Husband

MARGARETS HUSBAND
It is very good to meet you sir

SOLOMON
We have much acquainting to do
Margaret rises she presents her bundle to her father

MARGARET
And this is your grandson
Solomon Northup Staunton

SOLOMON
Solomon
The fact his grandson carries his name is overwhelming
Solomon breaks down Emotionally physically But

ANNE IS THERE TO CATCH HIM As she holds him Solomon
says to Anne with all his heart

SOLOMON (CONTD)
Forgive me

ANNE
There is nothing to forgive
The pair joined now by the whole family hold on to each
other for lifeand one would think for all the rest of
their lives

FADE TO

BLACK

CARD
Upon gaining his freedom Solomon Northup located and
attempted to seek legal justice against the men who

kidnapped him The case was tried in Washington DC
where blacks were prohibited by law from testifying

169 169
against whites The charges against the kidnappers were
eventually dismissed

Northup spent the rest of his life working as an
abolitionist and with the Underground Railroad
Solomon Northup most likely died between 1863 and 1875
The exact date place and circumstances of his death
remain unknown
