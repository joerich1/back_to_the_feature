BLACKNESS

Pink Floyds Dark Side of the Moon (Brain Damage) plays as
WHITE TITLES appear over black As the song crescendos at

the first chorus SUNLIGHT flares over the lunar horizon and

a crescent sliver of THE MOON is illuminated - huge filling
the screen from top to bottom Were in space circling around
from the dark side until a HUGE FULL MOON fills the screen
with whiteness - TITLES continue as we pull back from the
moon into the earths atmosphere through CLOUDS until we
reveal

PARIS AT NIGHT

We come to rest on an ancient vaguely wolf-like GARGOYLE
high atop a gothic cathedral in the Latin Quarter - a maze
of narrow twisting streets - desolate at this late hour
Clouds move over the moon End TITLES The song fades A
THUNDER CRACK Rain drops spatter on the churchs metal roof
Water trickles out of the gargoyles mouth We follow the
STREAM OF WATER down to street level where it falls onto

A YOUNG COUPLE

wobbling down the street sharing a bottle of wine They

open an umbrella and stand underneath it smooching and
giggling We follow the STREAM OF WATER from their umbrella

to the street where it swirls into drain holes in the MANHOLE
COVER that theyre standing on Suddenly

CLANG The manhole cover pushes up under their feet He
flinches - bites down on her lip drawing blood She yelps

CLANG The cover thrusts up again They lose their balance
fall to the ground - the wine bottle smashes The manhole
cover flips off its hole Horrified they scramble from it
Then out of it comes

TERRENCE MCDERMOTT

a fiftyish college professor in a turtleneck and old tweed
jacket clutching a well worn leather shoulder bag and gasping
for breath Hes balding with longish gray hair and intense
eyes He climbs out of the hole replaces the cover and dashes
off desperately through the rain looking back over his
shoulder as he disappears into a narrow alley

The couple watch him go befuddled She touches her hand to
her lip and looks at the blood She slaps her boyfriend upside
the head

GIRL
Idiot

The guy shrugs Then

BAM The manhole cover explodes off the hole sails twenty
feet into the air and clatters to the ground some distance
away We cut to the couples horrified reactions as they
watch something emerge from the hole

ON A NEARBY STREET

Terrence running hears the couples horrible SCREAMS echo
through the twisting streets He comes to A STONE STAIRWAY
and hurries down it four steps at a time At the bottom he
turns right and arrives at a star shaped five way
intersection

A low muffled growl stops him in his tracks He stands in
the rain panting looking around at the dark maze of streets
trying to pinpoint the source of the sound

TERRENCE
(American accent - to
himself)
Where are you you sick bastard

A TAXI appears a block away He waves his arms and calls out
in a very good French accent

TERRENCE
Taxi Ici sil vous plait

It turns and drives towards him He starts off towards it
He glances over his shoulder - sees nothing Hes twenty
feet from the taxi He smiles Then -

Hes jerked violently downward into A STORM DRAIN He screams
Some monstrous force pulls him down his bones crushing as
his body is forced through the too-small drain

The CABBY gets out and runs up to the drain where Terrences
thrashing upper body is quickly disappearing into the hole
Horrible growls and sounds of ripping flesh emanate from the
sewer BLOOD spurts through the grate Terrence reaches up

to the cabby SCREAMING for help

TERRENCE
My God Help Au securs

The terror stricken cabby shakes his head and starts backing
up Terrence lunges forth and grabs the cabbys leg The
cabby screams and tries to get loose He falls to the ground
and is dragged towards the hole He grabs the bumper of his
cab and strains to pull himself away kicking at Terrences
hand with his free foot

LIGHTS come on in an adjacent building A MAN in pajamas

runs out into the rain The cabby loses his grip on the bumper
and he and Terrence are jerked closer to the sewer but the

man grabs the cabbys hand and pulls Some OTHER RESIDENTS
gather on the sidewalks A police car SIREN approaches

Something gives and the man in pajamas falls backwards into

a puddle The small crowd looks down and sees TERRENCE pulled
free from the hole moaning semi-consciously We move down

his body past the bleeding stumps where his legs used to

be and follow the BLOOD as it swirls into EDDIES of rain
water and flows into the BLACKNESS of the storm drain

CUT TO
A FIERCE BULL

charges through the matadors red muletta snorting blood
The CROWD goes wild Were in a bull fight arena under the
blazing Spanish sun

The camera dollies past cheering SPANIARDS and finds a small
group of AMERICAN STUDENTS early twenties

GORD
Man I cant believe I paid good
money to watch a guy in tight pants
kill a cow

SHERRY
Disgusting This makes American
Gladiators look highbrow

The camera settles on ANDY MCDERMOTT 22 as he joins the
crowd in a rousing cheer waving a bottle of wine with native
gusto Hes good looking in a scrappy sort of way with
shoulder length brown hair grungy plaid shirt khakis and
glasses

ANDY
Whoo Ole
(to his friends)

Man you guys are losers This is
poetry Death in the afternoon a
tragic dance of man and beast just
like Hemingway said God Spain is
it These people know how to live

SHERRY
I still say we shouldve gone to
Paris
ANDY
Paris Ug If I wanted to be in an
overpriced overrated city full of
obnoxious assholes I wouldve stayed
in New York Please

Another friend MIKE joins them

GORD
Whereve you been Beatin off in
your sombrero again

Mike swats Steve in the head playfully and grabs the wine
from Andy He hands him a crumpled telegram

MIKE
McDermott your dad sent this to the
pensione Supposed to be urgent

ANDY
(concerned)
Whats it about

MIKE
(defensive)
I didnt read it

Andy takes the telegram Mike leans in close to Sherrie and
whispers the gossip

MIKE
His uncle is in the hospital

Andy reads the message His face falls For a second hes
silent His friends see somethings wrong

GORD
Hey man You okay What is it

Andy grabs the wine away from Mike and takes a long swig IN
THE BULLRING - the matador plunges his sword between the
bulls shoulder blades and makes the kill

CUT TO
INT PARIS HOSPITAL EMERGENCY WARD - EARLY EVENING

BLOOD splatters on white paper Pull back to see a CHEF with
a cut finger standing at the admitting counter dripping
blood on a form The uptight Parisian NURSE scolds him and
pulls out a new form

ANDY lugging his back pack trudges through the sliding
glass doors marked St Severin Hospital Bleary eyed hung
over burdened by a heavy backpack and carrying the crumpled
telegram he approaches ANOTHER NURSE at the counter
ANDY
Um excuse me hello

A STOUT WOMAN with a POODLE charges in front of Andy and
launches into a loud French argument with the nurse over the
hospitals humans only admission policy

WOMAN
(French)
Pitou needs a real doctor Hes
melancholy

ANDY
Hey wait a minute

Andy tries to push his way back in but the shrill little
dog yaps at him Andy grabs his aching hangover head in
agony The bleeding chef walks away dripping leaving the
other nurse free Andy approaches her She has her head down
in some paperwork

ANDY
Pardon Excusez moi Allo

Without looking up she holds up a please wait finger
Andy sighs The poodle yaps at him again He winces and tries
to get the nurses attention

ANDY
(to Nurse)
Umm

She raises her finger sharply and glares at him She goes
back to her paperwork Andy starts chatting politely with
her pretending shes responding

ANDY
So you ever been to Spain Youd
love it Its friendly sunny
cheap And youd be the only raving
bitch there instead of just one in
the crowd up here

MARCEL BOULARD a short middle aged cop in a rumpled coat
approaches He taps Andy on the shoulder

MARCEL
Andrew Mc-dair-mo

ANDY
Thats McDermott but yeah

Marcel flashes his badge

MARCEL
Detective Boulard Weve been
expecting you This is Inspector
Leduc

LEDUC in his fifties taller heavy set droopy mustache
nods gruffly and starts towards the elevator motioning for
them to follow

MARCEL
Hes in charge but uh between you
and me my English is better
(they hurry to catch
up with LeDuc)
This way So youre from New York
eh I love those Hill Street Blues

ANDY
Right Listen my uncle its not
serious is it Did he eat some bad
snails Slip on the bidet What

They step into the elevator as LeDuc holds the door open
Marcel and LeDuc trade uneasy glances LeDuc sighs

LEDUC
Merde

MARCEL
He says -

ANDY

Yeah okay My French isnt that bad
INT HOSPITAL ROOM

TERRENCE lies comatose under a clear plastic oxygen tent An
ORDERLY changes the dressing on his bloody stumps A NURSE
fiddles with the vast array of bleeping burbling sucking
life support machinery

Andy dumb struck watches from a few paces away Marcel
pad in hand asks him questions LeDuc stays in the
background listening and studying Andy intently

ANDY
Jesus

MARCEL
How well did er do you know him

ANDY
Not too well He taught at the
Sorbonne right Dad always calls
him his hippie brother Did some
work with Timothy Leary I think and -
Is he is he going to die

MARCEL
No The doctors say the machines
should keep him going a long time
But basically he is how you say a
legume

ANDY
Legume You mean a vegetable

MARCEL
Vegetable right My mistake It
seems he was attacked by a maniac
maybe two or three maniacs just
after midnight yesterday They fled
into the tunnels beneath Paris thats
all we know

ANDY
What do you mean maniacs

MARCEL

Well heres what I think happened

A chemistry professor goes to a bad
part of town late at night Why
Perhaps hes making a few francs on
the side The psychedelic drug market
is big these days He gets mixed up
with a bad crowd and like they say
if you lie with dogs you get fleas

ANDY
Yeah well these fleas must have
teeth like fuckin chain saws

BEEP BEEP Somethings wrong with uncle Terrences machinery
The IV bottle is sputtering and bubbling the EKG monitor is
flashing The orderlies snap into action and pull the curtain
shut waving no problem to Andy and Marcel Marcel leads
Andy away trying to calm him down

MARCEL
Maybe we should go now You must be
very tired Well call if any new -

ANDY
I cant believe this Why dont you
go down in the tunnels and find the
goddamn animals that attacked my
uncle

MARCEL
Andy its not so easy There are
hundreds of kilometers of tunnels
under Paris Its a whole other city
crawling with drug addicts lunatics
skinheads Its no mans land

Andys about to protest when LeDuc steps in and hands him
uncle Terrences leather bag

LEDUC
Here

MARCEL
Your uncle was carrying this The
keys to his apartment are in there
I talked to his assistant Madame
Flocquet Youll be staying there a
while

ANDY
Yeah I guess so
(they walk him to the
elevator)
Did he say anything Before the coma

MARCEL
Just the name of this hospital St
Severin He repeated it a few times
then he lost consciousness

ANDY
Why would he pick this one

MARCEL
I dont know There were others much
closer He was religious

ANDY
Not that I know

MARCEL
Well when youre about to pop off
what have you got to lose Thanks
for your help

Andys dumfounded at Marcels lack of tact The elevator
doors start to close LeDuc nods good-bye Marcel leans in
and sneaks in one last comment

MARCEL
And remember Andy lets be careful
out there Heh-heh Ouch

The elevator doors knock him on the head as they close Andy
shakes his head

ANDY
(to himself)
Inspector Clouseau on the case

Great

CUT TO

EXT TERRENCES APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
Andy opens the gate of this beautiful 19th century building
and walks through THE COURTYARD to the main entrance A POODLE
yaps at him The dog is in the open doorway of the Concierges
apartment which opens into the courtyard The nosy concierge
MADAME CHRETIEN calls the dog LULU back in and shuts the
door

Andy enters the dark LOBBY finds the timed auto shut-off
light switch and turns it on He boards the old fashioned
wire cage elevator and presses the button for 4 McDermott
The elevator ascends painstakingly slowly Andy resigns
himself to waiting thumbs through his uncles date book

Andy turns to the day Uncle Terrence was attacked A circled
cryptic entry at the bottom of the page reads Meet Claude
Medusa - 1100 Andy wrinkles his brow At this second the
light goes out

Andy ascends the rest of the way in darkness The doors open
on the fourth floor He gets out and finds his way to the
apartment He tries a key in the lock It wont turn He
jiggles it No luck He goes through this with two more keys
grumbling under his breath Finally he finds the right one
He pushes the door open and gasps

Hes face to face with a scary TRIBAL MASK hanging in the
entrance way It startles him for a second

ANDY
This must be the place

INT TERRENCES APARTMENT

Andy walks in and sets down his bags A gun COCKS A young
womans voice screams at him in French

YOUNG WOMAN
(in French)
Who are you What do you want

He turns to see SERAFINE a beautiful young woman around
22 casually dressed and aiming a pistol at his head He
drops the shoulder bag and reaches for the ceiling

ANDY
Dont shoot Jesus uh Je
mappelle Andy McDermott Je suis
le um shit

It dawns on her She drops the gun to her side embarrassed
SERAFINE
(in English)

Oh fuck you are his nephew

ANDY
Yeah thats the word And you are

SERAFINE
Serafine Flocquet I work for your
uncle

ANDY

You Youre Madame Flocquet I
pictured a fat lady with an apron
not - I dont know - La Femme Nikita

Serafine puts the gun away in a drawer

SERAFINE
It sounded like someone picking the
lock After what happened I guess I
am a little nervous

She lights a cigarette

ANDY
Sure I can follow that

SERAFINE
Its a fucking nightmare isnt it

ANDY
Yeah True The cops werent much
help either Their theory is he was
moonlighting as a drug dealer or
something Make sense to you

SERAFINE

Police They have their head in their
asshole and they still cant find
shit

ANDY
Well put So what exactly has uncle
Terrence been up to lately

As he speaks he scans the apartment Its cluttered with an
overwhelming assortment of anthropological oddities from
around the globe medieval illustrations molecular models
and an artsy periodic table thats been used as a dart board

SERAFINE
Hes doing a book with Professor
Roussel about medieval chemistry I
was just transcribing his notes onto
the computer and - oh shit

She races out of the room Andy follows after her
INT TERRENCES STUDY

She runs in and finds the computer locked up She smacks it
a few times clicks the mouse taps the keyboard No response

SERAFINE
Salots Shitfucker

ANDY
(reacts to her loose
grasp of American
slang)
What

SERAFINE
If you leave it for more than a few
minutes it locks up Now I must reboot
and type a dozen fucking passwords
He was security crazy

She flicks a switch on the back of the computer rebooting
it Andy pauses to look at some nearby photos of his uncle

ANDY
I still cant get over it The cops
said it was a maniac but he looked
like I dont know like hed gone
through a combine harvester or
something

Serafine gets kind of emotional at the thought

SERAFINE
They wouldnt let me see him Family
only I told them Terry was almost
like a father to me you know

Andy reacts to her use of the informal Terry

ANDY
Depends Was Terry a father like
Ward Cleaver or a father like Woody
Allen

A beat She grasps his meaning Shes offended She starts
typing on the computer giving him the cold shoulder

SERAFINE
You must not have known him very
well Hes not like that

ANDY
Hey Sorry if I was out of line

SERAFINE
You were I have work to do The
publisher wants the transcripts by
Monday Go Make yourself at home

ANDY
Fine My mistake You know Im gonna
be a writer myself some day

SERAFINE
Uh-huh Good for you

Andy sees hes sunk He heads for the door but something on
the wall catches his eye A small flyer on the bulletin board

with a big drawing of Medusa He takes it down

ANDY
Medusa Whats this some kind of
club

SERAFINE

Its nothing A stupid party Not
really a night club its uh

ANDY
Like an underground club

SERAFINE
Yes Its a bad place Weird people

Strange things go on

ANDY
And whos Claude

Serafine looks at him hard questioning
ANDY
I looked through my uncles date

book Writers curiosity

She points to a paperback on the desk Its French

psychedelic cover depicting a man half King Louis XIV half
witch doctor The title (in French) History Inside Out -
Psychic Illumination Through the Ages by Dr Claude Roussel
A picture on the back shows an academic looking Claude in a

tweed jacket with gray hair

SERAFINE
Professor Claude Rousel The one
your uncle was working with He
teaches cultural history

ANDY
In an underground club Id like to
see that

He shoves the book in his back pocket Serafines emphatic

SERAFINE
Im serious Theres nothing for you
down there Its dangerous

ANDY
Come on Im from New York - the
shoot me state Dont wait up

He starts for the door She spins him around by the sleeve

SERAFINE
(suddenly quite angry)
What good can you do Why are you
being so fucking stupid

ANDY

(getting fired up)
Maybe I didnt know him like you
did But hes my uncle And I owe it
to him to get some answers Its a
quest like uh Hemingway the Old
Man and The Sea Except instead of
an old man Im a young man and
instead of the sea its a bunch of
tunnels under Paris And instead of
a big fish its who knows Thats
what Im going to find out Au revoir

He walks out of the office She calls after him

SERAFINE
Youre a fucking lunatic

The front door slams She looks after him incredulous

SERAFINE
(French)
God damned Americans

CUT TO
EXT RUE DENFER - NIGHT

A MEDUSA HEAD is carved in the stone above the doorway of a
crumbling old facade in a rundown Parisian neighborhood
Andy tries the front door Its locked Theres no sounds or
signs of life

ANDY
(to himself)
Some party

Andy starts off then pauses as three PARTY GOERS approach
the door Theyre modern-primitives - tribal tattoos
pierced noses and weird beaded hair One fishes a key from
the Medusas mouth opens the door and lets the group in

Andy slips in behind them One GUY in the group looks Andy
over and mutters something in French to his friends They
snigger amongst themselves and walk to a door across the
foyer Andy follows a few paces behind through the door
down some stairs into
A DILAPIDATED BASEMENT

Lit with a few candles They walk past an old boiler through
another door into

A NARROW STONE SPIRAL STAIRCASE

They proceed down the ancient stairway also lit only by the
occasional candle placed on the steps They reach the bottom
of the steps and enter a dark drippy stone tunnel still
lit by candles Some rats scurry away through the puddles
under Andys feet

Candles lead the way through the maze of intersecting tunnels
Some graffiti scratched in the wall catches Andys eye Jean
Philippe 1803 He pauses to look at it for and loses the
group ahead of him He follows the candles on his own turning
right left and left again A loud muffled bass beat gets
louder He rounds the corner into

THE WILD UNDERGROUND PARTY SPACE

In an open cavern lit with torches and strobe lights Two
hundred people are gyrating to eerie techno-tribal dance
music Its a weird crowd mostly young modern primitive
pierced and grungy RAVERS many wearing day-glo tribal face
paint Clusters of sullen militant SKINHEADS hang around
the periphery

An attractive blissed-out WAIF approaches Andy with a
paintbrush and a jar of day-glo face paint and a brush She
goes to paint Andys face He stops her

ANDY
Thats alright Ill be a cowboy

She smiles and pushes his hand down He shrugs and lets her
paint two day-glow red stripes on his cheeks

ANDY
Alright Fine
(with mock enthusiasm)
Ooh I can feel it tingling

Andy sniffs and makes a face - the paint has a weird smell

ANDY

Phew Whats in this stuff liquid
plumber

(he pulls the book

out of his pocket

and shows her Claudes

picture)
Do you know this guy Claude

WAIF
Ah oui le professeur La bas

She points to a dark alcove off the main cavern Andy nods

and starts off We move in on a leather clad young man leaning
against the wall watching Andy go This is GASTON DUFAUX a
self-styled Parisian thug who seems to be cultivating a

sort of Mickey Rourke look He takes a drag from his
cigarette and we see hes missing two fingers

Andy makes his way through the crowd People are dancing
with wild abandon and many carry torches A SKINNY GUY INA
DIAPER and a paper mache skull mask runs through the crowd
ranting and spraying fluorescent silly string He does a
weird dance around Andy and jabbers at him in French

ANDY
Uh lemme get back to ya on that

Andy approaches the side room and peers in A small group of
young people are listening intently to CLAUDE whose back is
to us Hes expounding about something in a solemn tone

CLAUDE
(French to group)
How ironic A man who dedicated
his life to opening the doors of the
mind now lies trapped behind them
Locked behind a door without a key

We follow Andy as he steps around the crowd and sees Claudes
face He looks older than in the photo - hes in his late
fifties with white hair and intense eyes

ANDY
Excusez moi I

Claude notices the book in Andys hand He speaks fluent
English

CLAUDE
Im sorry my friend Im not signing
books right now Theres been a

tragedy

ANDY
I know Im Andy McDermott Terrences
nephew

Claude is taken by surprise

CLAUDE
My God Im sorry But how did you
find your way down here Wait lets
go talk

He excuses himself from his flock and leads Andy to a quiet
corner of the room The kids disperse several looking
sympathetically at Andy

CLAUDE
Its horrible Terrence was one of
the most brilliant men Ive known

ANDY
Yeah well why did he hang out here
The cops said its dangerous -

CLAUDE

The cops Its their backward laws
that force all this underground in

the first place endangering people
whose only crime is pushing the limits
of perception exploring new states

of psychic awareness

Theyre suddenly doused with day-glo silly string as the
gibbering idiot in the diaper pops in to deliver a rant at
them

GUY IN DIAPER
(French)
The moon is bleeding Prepare for
the downpour

He ducks back out Andy picks the silly string out of his
hair

ANDY
Psychic awareness Right

CLAUDE
You think its silly But do you
realize that young man is actually
in a deep sleep

ANDY
What

CLAUDE
Hes on a new drug called ZBH or
Daydream It allows the user to be
fully alert and mobile while hes
dreaming He is literally conscious
and unconscious at the same time

ANDY
Yeah well thats like really groovy
and everything but who hacked my
uncles legs off

Claude frowns He looks grave

CLAUDE
Andy
ANDY
Yeah

CLAUDE
Terrence and I came down here to do
serious work For centuries these
tunnels have been home to subcultures
mainstream society would not tolerate

He gestures to the main cavern where people are far gone

into various states some in a trance some gyrating lustily
to the eerily hypnotic music We intercut with these images

as Claude speaks

CLAUDE

These people carry on traditions
dating back to pagan times - the
ancient quest for expanded
consciousness At the same time
theyre pioneering a chemical
revolution powerful state-of-the-
art compounds But you know what I
mean

(he gestures to Andys

face paint)
A year ago who would have dreamed of
topically applied hallucinogens like
TMD Except Terry of course

Andys eyes widen with comprehension He touches his face

ANDY
What Hallucinogen Oh shit

He rubs the face paint off with his shirt sleeve

CLAUDE
You didnt know But then why did
you well dont worry Its

relatively mild

ANDY
Yeah well if I claw my face off
just pack it in ice okay Jesus
the cops were probably right My
uncle was messed up with a bunch of
fry brains and they went berserk on
him

Claude lowers his voice He looks grim

CLAUDE
No We stumbled on something else
down here Andy Something horrible
almost unbelievable But very real
Its been going on for centuries
though most people wouldnt believe
it or wouldnt want to

Andys somewhere between spooked and incredulous He glances
at the book in his hand

ANDY
Wait a second are you like the Steven
King of France or something

SERAFINE (0OS)
Andy

Andy turns and sees Serafine run up to him She looks worried

ANDY
So you came after all Just in time
its getting interesting

SERAFINE
You must get out of here Its not
safe

She grabs him by the arm He resists

ANDY
Not you too -

CLAUDE
(checks his watch)
My God Serafines right Its time
to go Well talk soon

SERAFINE
Bon nuit Claude
(to Andy)
Come on

Claude dashes off Serafine drags Andy into the main cavern

ANDY
Hey chill out a second

She leads him across the cavern towards the entrance Andy
stops short and pulls away from her Its not easy - she has
a strong grip

ANDY
Alright hold on Im not gonna get
dragged around like some kid in a
shopping mall I want you to answer
some questions

Serafine sees something over Andys shoulder

SERAFINE
Merde I knew I shouldnt have come
here
Andy turns to see Gaston approaching He leers at Serafine

GASTON
(Frenc
Serafine mon cher I hear your boss
looks great in cut-offs

SERAFINE
(Frenc
Get the fuck away from me Gaston

GASTON

(Frenc
First you tell me where the ADM is
eh

He puts his hand on her shoulder Andy notices the missing
fingers

SERAFINE
(French)
Fuck you

She shoves his hand away and pulls Andy past him Gaston

grabs her and spins her around This time Andy grabs Gastons
hand and pulls it off her He holds up Gastons three fingered
hand and glares at him

ANDY
Well this explains the two fingers
they found in Liberaces asshole

Gaston jerks his hand away He stabs his finger in Andys
chest

GASTON
In Paris we have an expression for
people like you Enculé dAmericain

ANDY
Yeah In New York we got an expression
too Goes like this

CRACK Andy hauls off and belts Gaston in the jaw as hard as
he can But Gaston doesnt even lose his footing He sneers
with rage and hits Andy with a vicious combination His
glasses fly off as he reels into the crowd knocking a few
people into a group of nearby SKINHEADS The skinheads erupt
into randomly directed violence - a full fledged BRAWL breaks
out Its chaos

On the floor Andy squirms away from the skinheads and
retrieves his glasses He hears Serafine call his name He
gets up amidst the mayhem and sees Serafine being carried
away by the crowd
ANDY
Serafine

Someone knocks into Andy and he falls to the ground He gets
back on his feet - Serafines nowhere in sight He pushes
his way through the crowd looking for her He catches sight
of her white dress in a distant corner Its there for a
second and then gone again - apparently into a tunnel He
runs over to it

Andy peers into THE TUNNEL which houses some old pipes It
fades quickly into darkness He grabs a kerosene torch from
the wall and runs into the tunnel About a hundred yards in
he passes an ALCOVE

He leans in with his torch and peers around The cave like
room is empty but something catches Andys eye Scratched
into the stone wall amidst various graffiti is A PENTAGRAM
It looks to be centuries old

Andys transfixed by it The sound of his own breathing
suddenly becomes deafening and his vision begins to distort
the textures of the stone wall begin to churn and crawl and
the flames from his torch melt into different hues The
pentagram glows and seems to grow out of the wall

The hallucinatory flash is over as fast as it began Panting
stunned Andy shakes it off He wipes his face checking for
traces of paint He tries to reassure himself

ANDY
Whoa Cmon

A womans SCREAM echoes through the tunnels He runs towards
it

ANDY
Serafine

Another scream - anguished tortured Andy runs faster He
arrives at an intersection with another tunnel turns the
corner and finds

A decrepit old WINO hogging a bottle from his warty HAG
companion provoking her to scream like she just lost her
only son They look up at Andy The hag shuts up They fix
Andy with an odd stare

ANDY
Sorry I uh did you see a girl
la femme um avec la dress blanc

They just stare at him Spooked he walks past them They
follow him with their creepy stare as he continues into the
tunnel which slopes downhill
He comes to an old stairway leading down into darkness WATER
pours out of a hole in the ceiling The steps are severely
eroded and slick with flowing water and moss Andy sees
something Its SERAFINES SHOE laying on a landing a few
yards down the stairs He leans in further loses his footing
and slips

ANDY
Ahh Son of a bitch

He shoots down the stairs on his back past the shoe which
lies at the mouth of an intersecting tunnel His glasses
come off The torch goes out He stops at the bottom of the
stairs on a gravel surface

He winces a bit as he sits up Its too dark to make much
out He feels around the gravel finds his GLASSES - theyre
shattered He scowls He stands up and walks ahead feeling
his way along the slick wall peering into the darkness

ANDY
SERAFINE

The echo sounds different - like hes in a larger space The
echo decays into a familiar low RUMBLE

A reflection of light appears in a puddle on the floor The
light gets brighter until Andy sees the subway tracks at his

feet The rumble gets suddenly louder as

METRO TRAIN

barrels around the corner flooding the tunnel with light
and closing on Andy fast

ANDY
Oh shit

He turns and runs for THE STAIRWAY He skids on the gravel
and overshoots it He scrambles back and up into it just as
THE TRAIN whooshes past

Andy scurries a few feet up the slick steps using a rusty
pipe for a handhold As he looks back at the SPARKING RUSHING
TRAIN WHEELS his heart pounding in his head he has another
HALLUCINATORY-FLASH the sparks explode into streaking
patterns of color and light

It passes quickly The train goes by and its rumble fades
Andy squeezes his temples and takes a deep breath Before he
finishes exhaling an UNEARTHLY HOWL echoes through the
tunnels The howl literally takes his breath away - hes
frozen there eyes wide not breathing for a long moment

Quietly carefully he makes his way back up the dark wet
stairs He comes to the landing picks up Serafines shoe
and steps into the INTERSECTING TUNNEL
He squints into the darkness Without his glasses ANDYS
POV is a bit blurry

He walks into the tunnel Another HOWL Andy swallows hard

ANDY
Jesus Christ

He hurries along WATER DRIPS from the tunnel ceiling down
the walls onto the cobblestone floor flowing into rivulets
around Andys feet and joining a stream that flows ahead of
him disappearing into the blackness ahead He approaches
another intersection He stumbles over something

He looks down and makes out a GIRLS BARE LEG lying in a

puddle in the dark intersecting tunnel He follows the leg
up with his eyes - its messily severed above the knee He
gasps

He looks further into the tunnel and sees A PAIR OF GLOWING
YELLOW EYES staring back at him out of the darkness Andy
turns and runs

With a horrible ROAR the eyes lunge after him and turn the
corner As it gains on Andy we see the dim outline of the
massive wolf-like beast

Andy dives for a SMALL CONDUIT barely big enough for his
body and wriggles into it Behind him the yellow eyes appear
at the mouth of the conduit - the beast SNARLS but cant fit
in Andy can see a dim light at the end of the conduit He
crawls along

He emerges into ANOTHER TUNNEL Some thirty yards away light
and street noise come through a GRATE on the ceiling of an
antechamber beyond an iron gate Relieved Andy starts off
towards it A SNARL stops him in his tracks THE BEAST comes
tearing around a corner fifty yards behind him

Andy breaks into a sprint towards the antechamber He slips
on the wet floor and lands in a puddle drenching himself
The beast closes in

Andy gets up runs into the antechamber and slams the iron
gate shut Theres a rusty DEADBOLT lock on the gate but no
key The beast is twenty five yards away and closing fast -
its massive silhouette filling the diameter of the tunnel

Andy whips out his SWISS ARMY KNIFE opens the screw driver
and tries it in the old-fashioned keyhole - it doesnt work
The beast is twenty feet away Andy tries the can opener -
no luck Ten feet Andy jams the corkscrew into the hole
The beast leaps The corkscrew turns The DEADBOLT SLIDES

SLAM The beast rams the gate shaking the anteroom But it
holds Flashes of CLAWS and TEETH thrash through the bars
but its still too dark to make the beast out clearly Andy
runs across the anteroom grabs the steel sewer grate on the
ceiling and hoists himself up

Through the bars he sees a BUSY BOULEVARD in the Pigalle
(the Times Square of Paris) Theres a COP a few paces
away Andy screams to him

ANDY
HELP OFFICER

ON THE BOULEVARD - Over the roar of traffic and midnight
revelers the cop can barely pinpoint Andys screams He
looks around confused He sees Andy and angrily shakes his
baton at him

COP
(French)
Hey You shouldnt be down there

ANDY
FOR GODS SAKES LET ME OUT

THE BEAST slams the gate wrenching one of the iron bars
loose - two more bars and itll fit through Andy jumps down
picks up the loose bar Its got a STAR SHAPED SPEAR TIP

He rushes at the gate and jams the spear through the gate
aiming for the thrashing teeth and eyes in the darkness

The beast ducks and the spear sinks a couple of inches into
the BACK OF ITS NECK and stops apparently on bone It
recoils and ROARS with pain shaking the spear free

ON THE STREET - The cop raps the bars with his nightstick
and peers into the dark anteroom

COP
(in French)
You are not allowed down there

IN THE ANTEROOM - The beast rams the gate - its rage
redoubled Andy jumps up and grabs the grate

ANDY
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE

ON THE STREET

COP
(French)
Fuck You think I dont know this
word fuck Is that how you talk to
policemen in America

Enraged the cop runs to his car muttering to himself He
opens the trunk and rummages around for something
IN THE ANTEROOM - The beast knocks another bar off the gate
Andy watches in horror as it rams even harder loosening the
NEXT BAR

ANDY
(to the cop)
FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK

ON THE STREET - The cop looks over at Andy incensed He
takes a crowbar from the trunk runs back cussing in French
and struggles with the grate

IN THE ANTEROOM - The NEXT BAR on the gate gives The beast
sticks its head through the gap and focuses its searing
yellow eyes on Andy It rears back ready to pounce

THE GRATE - comes up The cop grabs Andy and pulls

IN THE ANTEROOM - Andys legs dangle like bait The beast
lunges teeth and claws bared

ON THE STREET - Andy screams as a bus roars by The cop pulls
him up and out Andys right pants leg is torn open and hes
bleeding from a GOUGE in his ankle

COP
(French)
Okay what the hell are you up to

ANDY
It bit me My leg Jesus its down
there shoot it Shoot it for Christs
sakes

He points frantically at the open hole The cop aims his
flashlight in the hole Its empty He looks Andy up and
down

COP
(French)
Your passport

Shaking Andy takes his passport out of his pocket The cop
takes it and copies some information Andy raves at him - a
blur of English and broken French

ANDY
Theres something down there A bear
or something A god damn monster
Beau coup teeth Huge Grande with
yellow eyes all this hair it killed
Serafine My God

COP
You on drugs Huh
ANDY
(he falters)
No I

He looks disoriented half-crazed He definitely seems like
hes on drugs The cop shines his flashlight in Andys eyes -
his PUPILS are like saucers

ANDYS POV

The cops flashlight sparks another HALLUCINATORY FLASH The
cops face melts like liquid sounds swirl together the garish
neon signs of The Pigalle explode into streaking colors and

we BURN INTO WHITE

CUT TO
EXT TERRENCES APARTMENT BUILDING

The cop car pulls to a stop The cop gets out opens the
back door and pulls Andy out He pushes Andy towards the
building

COP
(French)
Stay off the street

The cop gets in the car and drives away Andy staggers to
the gate in a daze and fumbles with the keys

INT APARTMENT BUILDING

Andy walks up to the apartment door Disoriented and shaking
he manages to open the door and walk in He locks the door
and switches on the lights He looks out the small PEEPHOLE
No sign of anyone or anything He leans back against the
door and rubs his hands across his face

ANDY
Oh god Je suis seriously messed
up

Theres a DRIPPING sound coming from the kitchen Andy looks
across the living room into the dark kitchen The DRIP
continues He steps forward cautiously Suddenly he feels
something and looks down sharply

UNCLE TERRENCE bloody stumps and all is clutching Andys
legs and looking up at him desperately Hes trying to speak
but cant seem to make a sound Blood from his wounds soaks
the WHITE BEAR RUG beneath them

Andys terror struck he tries to jump away but falls
backwards to the floor Terrence crawls up and gets close to

Andys face He croaks out two words in a rasp -

with dusty tomes He browses past dozens of titles about
black magic and demonology

LEDUC

her head around and sees him Shes surprised relieved

CUT TO
EXT PARIS BOULEVARD - DAY
JERRY LEWIS

on a TV screen dubbed with a zany French voice undergoes a
radical physical transformation in The Nutty Professor

Pull back to reveal Andy and Serafine watching this scene on

a dozen or so TVs in a store window display Several PARISIAN
PEDESTRIANS watch Jerry with reverence

ANDY
Now this is Paris

On screen the Nutty Professors alter ego Buddy Love
launches into his swinging version of That Old Black Magic
To this accompaniment we cut the following -

PARIS MONTAGE

- AT A BRASSERIE Andy is about to escort Serafine into the
trendy eatery but she stops him at the door and points to
the menu or more specifically the prices He makes a
horrified face and they move on

- IN A BOULANGERIE Serafine buys cheese Andy buys meats -
the counterman shows Andy how big a slice off the pate loaf
hes about to cut Andy nods yes The counterman cuts it
and offers the slice Andy shakes his head no and points
to the much larger remainder of the loaf
- AT AN OUTDOOR MARKET Detective Marcel wearing a lame
disguise (new wave sunglasses ala Diva) watches Andy
and Serafine shop from a distance

- IN A PATISSERIE Andy points to a large baguette says
something suggestive and winks boastfully at Serafine She
gives him a yeah right look and points at a small
breadstick

- IN A WINE STORE Andy looks at each bottle closely then
tests it by shaking vigorously Serafines amused The
owners baffled

- ON THE RIGHT BANK Arms full of groceries Andy and Serafine
pass the row of outdoor pet stores near the river Andy looks
longingly at the live ducks in their cages Serafine pulls
him along MUSIC fades out

EXT ILE SAINT LOUIS - SUNSET

Andy and Serafine sit on the river bank facing a magnificent
Paris vista Serafine unpacks the food

SERAFINE
Shit You bought enough pate for a
fucking army

ANDY
So tell me exactly which truck driver
did you study English with

She laughs and pushes him playfully

ANDY
Like I should talk Monsieur foot-in-
the-mouth Im really sorry about
that whole Woody Allen thing

SERAFINE

Sos Woody Allen

(Andy laughs She

starts uncorking the

wine)
No your uncle really helped me I
was sort of messed up for a while
Wasting my time just partying and
just stupid shit He kind of woke me
up gave me a job got me taking
classes

(she uncorks the wine

and fills their

plastic cups)
You know he and Claude their work
is controversial but theyre serious
about it Totally dedicated
ANDY

Thats what counts If youre not
passionate about it dont waste
your time Thats why I quit
college Plus Im a lazy bastard

(They raise their

cups Andy taps his

forehead)
Wait I know this A votre sante

SERAFINE
A la votre

They clink and drink He notices her KEYCHAIN lying on the
ground Its a miniature replica of Rodins famous sculpture
The Kiss He picks it up

ANDY
This looks familiar

SERAFINE
Ahh Rodin Mmm Hes the fuc-
(she catches herself
and laughs)
I mean hes the best You must go
to the Rodin sculpture garden in
the huitieme its so beautiful

She gestures across the river Andy looks at the gorgeous
panorama

ANDY
Yeah I gotta admit you French are
pretty good at beautiful

He looks at Serafine She looks back at him He holds up
The Kiss

ANDY
I bet youre pretty good at this
too
She smiles playfully
SERAFINE

What sculpting

He shakes his head no and moves towards her They kiss
tenderly They separate and share a deep passionate look
They kiss again hungrily falling into a passionate embrace
Theyre really going for it Her NAILS dig into his back He
pulls her body into his until they look like one form - just
like Rodins sculpture

APPLAUSE and CHEERS break the moment A TOURIST BOAT is
gliding by on the Seine its ELDERLY PASSENGERS applauding
the young couple Serafine pulls away blushing a little
and turns to the boat ANDY doesnt even notice the boat
Hes staring at Sera fine with a scary kind of intensity
She starts to say something but he starts kissing her again
cutting her off

Suddenly hes out of control pawing at her It takes an
effort for her to pull back from him

SERAFINE
Hey calm down a second

She looks into his eyes and freezes with fear HIS STARE is
terrifying totally predatory inhuman Somethings ignited
in him She pushes him away and shakes him

SERAFINE
Whats wrong with you

Andy blinks and seems to come a couple of steps back to
normality

ANDY
What Arent I a good kisser Whats
the matter

She fixes him with a heavy suspicious stare She glances
down at his ankle where the bottom of HIS WOUND is visible
She seems to understand something She fumbles in her purse
takes out a compact mirror and checks her face

SERAFINE
God look at my lipstick Look Im
going to run into the bathroom at
that cafe Stay here and watch the
stuff okay

She gets up and starts off He looks after her

ANDY
Serafine

SERAFINE
Ill be right back Stay put

She runs up the steps to street level Andy watches her go

He turns back to his glass of wine and chugs it He puts the
bottle to his lips and takes a long belt He picks up the

big block of pate and bites into it like a piece of cake He
likes it He takes another huge bite He looks after Serafine
He gets up

INT CAFE

Serafine puts her telecarte into the pay phone and dials
She looks anxious upset We hear the phone ringing at the
other end Behind her Andy comes into the cafe He walks up
to her pissed off
ANDY
Fixing your makeup with a phone

SERAFINE
Professor Roussel Theres something
wrong with you I know it

ANDY
Roussel You mean Claude Youre
calling Dr Demento so he can come

Andy starts backing away

SERAFINE
Andy stop I think he can help you -

CLAUDE (VO)

ANDY

SERAFINE
(French)

SERAFINE

INT CLAUDES OFFICE - SAME TIME
Claudes sitting at his desk phone to his ear The room is
stuffed with books

He hangs up He strokes his chin and furrows his brow sinking
deep into thought

CUT TO
EXT STREETS OF PARIS - NIGHT

Music cue Wolf Call by Elvis Presley Andy pays for a
crepe at one of the roadside stands and eats it as he walks
along the narrow sidewalk still brooding about Serafine He
stops to gawk at the PRETTY GIRLS that pass by and bumps
into a young FRENCH TOUGH with a ROTTWEILER

FRENCH TOUGH
Idiot

ANDY
Ah bite me

He glares at the tough and his growling dog The dog suddenly
shrinks back in fear and decides its time to leave He pulls
his owner along Andy continues on his way He ditches the
half finished crepe Thats not what hes hungry for

Andy comes upon a trendy little CAFE with several tables of
diners eating in the open air Andy notices an attractive
young blond sitting alone thumbing through a Lets Go
guide This is AMY SINGLETON Andy approaches confidently

ANDY
Ahem Did you know that according
to the Lets Go code of conduct
whenever two Americans meet in Paris
the one with the sexiest smile has
to buy dinner

Amy smiles She is indeed sexy with remarkable sparkling
BLUE EYES

ANDY
Damn You win Waiter Garcon

He jumps into the seat across from her

AMY
Actually Im waiting for someone

ANDY
What a coincidence I am someone
(sniffs)
Mmm Calvin Kleins Obsession Now
its mine too

She laughs The waiter arrives to take their order Andy
hands him the empty half bottle of wine from Amys table

ANDY
Hi Another bigger bottle for this
ravishing blue eyed Goddess and
myself And avez vous le Steak
Tartar

CUT TO
INT TERRENCES APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - SAME TIME

Serafine unlocks the door and enters the apartment Shes
stopped cold by what she sees The place has been totally
ransacked - drawers opened shelves cleared furniture
overturned the works The window is open

SERAFINE
Merde Salots

She walks across the room kicking at the debris in her path
She stands in the middle of the mess absolutely furious

SERAFINE
Aaaaah

EXT STREET - CONTINUOUS

Across the street from the apartment building GASTON pauses
to light a cigarette He hears Serafines distant scream
looks towards the building and walks away

CUT TO
EXT CAFE - NIGHT

Three successive tables of upscale PARISIAN DINERS are gawking
at something At one table Inspector Marcel hides behind
his menu and shakes his head in disdain

We follow their glances to Andy greedily licking the last
bits of Steak Tartar off his plate Amy giggles in amazement
as she pours the last from the bottle of wine Shes a bit
drunk - enough to be amused by Andys antics

AMY
God How can you eat like that

ANDY
Its all in the tongue Another
bottle

Amy laughs and nods yes JEAN-LUC 25 a well dressed
powerfully built Frenchman enters He kisses Amy on both
cheeks all the while watching Andy uneasily

AMY
Jean-Luc Youre kinda late sweetie

JEAN-LUC
I was busy Is this a friend of yours

AMY
Well yeah kinda but -

ANDY
Were so much more than friends
Were soul mates sex slaves pen
pals the whole nine yards Well
nine yards is a slight exaggeration
but believe me for a white boy I
got nothing to be ashamed of

Amy laughs in mid gulp and wine comes through her nose Andy
looks at Jean-Luc who is - of course - pretty steamed

ANDY
Hey Im kidding Its a joke
Here maybe if I say it in metric

Jean-Luc grabs Andy by the collar and pulls him to his feet

JEAN-LUC
Think youre smart huh

Amy tries to intervene

AMY
Jean-Luc dont be a jerk

She tries to pull his hands off Andy but Jean-Luc sends her
reeling back with a firm shove

ANDY
Hey look man she -

Jean-Luc brings his hand back and slaps Andy in the mouth

JEAN-LUC
Shut up Why are you Americans always
so loud

ANDY

I dont know Maybe its so we can
drown out the sound of your mother
fucking the navy

Jean-Luc takes a swing at Andy With amazing reflexes he
dodges it deftly Jean-Luc jabs - again Andy avoids it easily
He smiles impressed with himself Jean-Luc is incensed

He goes for Andys throat but Andy catches him by the arm
and with superhuman strength FLIPS him head over heels
through the air and - SMASH - onto a nearby table

Andy casually leans past the semi-conscious Jean-Luc and
plucks a CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE out of its ice bucket The WAITER
is about to object but thinks better of it Andy takes Amy
by the arm she grabs the RED WINE BOTTLE and they start
off away from the cafe

AMY
Wow You know Kung Fu or something

ANDY
(amazed at himself)
Yeah Apparently
In the background Marcel hurries to pay his tab and follow
them He slips on some of the broken glassware spilled by
Jean-Lucs fall and almost goes for a tumble himself

FURTHER DOWN THE STREET

Amy and Andy walk together Shes still giddy

AMY
Ha ha You were probably right about
his mom

ANDY

Hope I didnt hurt him too bad

AMY
Who gives a shit Ive had it up to
here with arrogant Frenchmen

ANDY
Up to there Really I bet I could
beat that

AMY
Ha ha Yeah right white boy Ha Ha
ha

(she hiccups)
I think maybe I drank too much

ANDY
Ah The mating call of the blonde
The night is young the moon is
bright whataya feel like doing
tonight

AMY
I dont know Surprise me

He thinks a moment then puts his arm around her and whispers
in her ear She squeals with delight
AMY
Are you kidding I LOVE Jim
Morrison

Inspector Marcel whos eavesdropping from around a nearby
corner rolls his eyes to heaven Oh brother The Doors
Backdoor Man kicks loud as we

CUT TO
EXT PERE LACHAISE - NIGHT

Marcel is hiding behind a grave spying His passion for
police work has been reborn judging from his rapt totally
absorbed stare Hes watching

ANDY AND AMY

having extremely hot and primal sex on Jim Morrisons grave
lit by dozens of flickering candles people have left for
Jim He pours red wine into their mouths Sweat and wine
drip off their naked bodies The sex heats up to an intense
screaming climax Amy squeals with ecstasy

AMY
My God Youre an animal

But Andys still accelerating - transported to another plane
Sweat pours from his brow His face contorts with each groan
but now its hard to tell if its from pleasure or pain His
body jerks violently and his skin suddenly blushes bright
red Amy winces

AMY
Ahh Jesus Youre burning hot What
the hell -

ANDY
AHHHHHHH

Marcel is a little disconcerted

MARCEL
(French to himself
Alright already you passed the
audition for Gods sakes

Andys skin literally glows red turning his sweat to steam
He leaps off Amy and disappears into the sprawling cemetery
screaming in agony Amy watches him go

AMY
Hey where are you going

Marcel starts off after Andy taking the wide route around
Amy Andys scream echoes through the cemetery Amy pulls
her dress on

AMY
Creep

ANDY

red hot (literally) weaves through the tombs screaming He
comes to a small courtyard with an ORNATE FOUNTAIN He dives
into the brackish water Clouds of steam rise off the water
as he thrashes about under the marble goddess in the center
of the fountain

AMY
searches through the graveyard Shes got Andys clothes

AMY
I dont know whats wrong with you
man but I got your pants so we
better talk

THE FOUNTAIN

Andys gurgling screams are changing becoming less human
We catch glimpses of body parts as they surface from the
churning froth - GROTESQUE FLAILING LIMBS somewhere in mid-
transformation between human and beast

MARCEL

steps cautiously through the ancient ornate tombs and
mausoleums listening to the distant splashing and sporadic
inhuman screams He draws his gun and loads a cartridge
Suddenly a horrible grunt and loud SMASH pierce the air
Marcel wheels around and smacks nose first into a gravestone

MARCEL
Merde

AMY

in another part of the graveyard stops in her tracks
listening Another SMASH followed by crumbling and rushing
water

AMY
(to herself)
Hes gone psycho ballistic This is
bad

Amy feels something and looks down Theres a stream of water
flowing around her feet She follows it towards its source

and steps into

THE COURTYARD
The fountain has been smashed - the stone rim cracked into
bits and the center statue fallen to the ground Theres no
sign of Andy Amy walks up to the fountain

AMY
Oh my God

She notices something on the ground Its the STONE GODDESS
smashed into several pieces We hear a low growl Amy looks
up terrified She scans the GRAVES around the perimeter of
the courtyard She takes a few tentative steps backward

Suddenly a MASSIVE TOMBSTONE is wrenched off its base (most
of the ancient stone markers are eroded and crumbling - many
already fallen over) It falls like a tree revealing the
familiar pair of piercing yellow eyes behind it framed by
the dim outline of a massive beast Amy emits an odd
primitive whine

AMY
Unnnhh

She runs away from the beast across the courtyard and
disappears into the graves

In the DENSE FOREST OF TALL TOMBSTONES Amy zigs and zags
through narrow spaces barely wide enough for her slender
body to fit through The camera CRANES UP

HIGH ANGLE

Thirty paces behind Amy pairs of tombstones split apart

like jungle vegetation crashing thunderously to the ground
The unseen beasts path is slowed by the monuments but still
follows Amy

Amy looks back as she runs She sees the tops of tombstones
fall behind her She comes to a railing at the top of a
fifteen foot wall separating a LOWER LEVEL of the cemetery
She hangs over the edge and quietly drops

She runs down a path comes to an intersection where six paths
converge She looks down each of them but cant see the
outer walls of the cemetery - just an endless landscape of
graves She sprints down a path and ducks behind A LARGE
CRYPT

Up on the higher level the beast howls She looks up and

sees its silhouette sniffing the air the full moon looming
behind it She looks up at the iron door on the crypt Then
she reaches into her purse

THE BEASTS POV

Its HEAVY BREATH dominates the soundtrack It scans the sprawl
of graves from its perch on the hill sniffing It locks
its stare on the large crypt It sniffs again With a growl
it leaps over the railing (we stay with its POV) and hits

the ground running It runs up a twisting path closing in

on THE CRYPT It arrives at the back of the crypt and circles
it sniffing It stops in front of the door

THE BEASTS EYES
Narrow and glow with intense predatory focus
INSIDE THE CRYPT

Were looking at the door CRASH It flies open revealing
the snarling beast backlit by the moon It lunges in and
stops

THE BEASTS POV

Scans back and forth - the crypt is empty The beast sniffs
again and growls with rage

AMY

somewhere else in the graveyard sprays a long blast of
perfume into another crypt and sneaks into the endless maze
of tombs We hear the enraged beast smash into another crypt
a hundred yards away

Amy comes to ANOTHER FOUNTAIN and slips into the water
quietly rinsing herself

THE BEASTS POV

smashes into another crypt Nothings inside It backs up
and runs to another crypt SMASH Nothing The growls grow
more furious It crashes down another door Nothing

Amy dripping wet pads down a row of ancient family
mausoleums She pauses as the beast lets loose a horrible
howl and topples a monument some distance away She tries
the heavy iron door on a SMALL GOTHIC MAUSOLEUM It opens
She slips inside

IN THE MAUSOLEUM

Amy crouches under the small portal and STAINED GLASS WINDOW
which depicts the Virgin Mary She struggles to quiet her
breathing and listens

She hears only the trickling water from the nearby fountain
Then some crackling twigs then a SNIFF another SNIFF
closer Trembling Amy quietly raises herself peers out the
portal and sees

MARCEL

Standing a few paces away SNIFFING and trying to stem the
flow from his bloody nose
MARCEL
Merde

Amy breaths a sigh of relief Then -

THE BEAST springs out of the darkness behind Marcel - a blur
of eyes claws and teeth - and tackles him to the ground

IN THE MAUSOLEUM

Amy drops down to the floor huddled in terror A GUN SHOT
hits the STAINED GLASS above Amys head shattering the Holy
Virgin Another GUN SHOT followed by a ROAR OF PAIN from the
beast But the pained roar quickly becomes VICIOUS SNARLING
again There are no more shots just horrible snarls screams
and ripping flesh BLOOD splatters through the portal and
drips down Amys face She hunkers down Then the sound of
steps going away and at last silence

Amy waits We hear only the fountain and another closer
DRIPPING Its Amys wet clothes still dripping into A PUDDLE
on the floor which is dripping UNDER THE IRON DOOR into a
small STREAM flowing on the otherwise dry STONE WALKWAY

away from the mausoleum

In the mausoleum Amy listens a bit more Satisfied the coast
is clear she quietly turns to the iron door grasps the
handle and slowly turns it But

before it clicks open -

RRRIIP The iron door is wrenched out of Amys hand and off
its hinges revealing

THE BEAST up close and in clear view for the first time -
its truly awesome - a huge leering mouth full of razor sharp
teeth a hulking body built like a wolf but as massive as a
bear and vaguely humanoid paws with big hook claws Theres
a bloody FLESH WOUND in its right shoulder

It snarls savagely at Amy She chokes out a little cry The
beast lunges

OUTSIDE THE MAUSOLEUM - HIGH ANGLE
The beasts powerful hind section sticks out of the mausoleum
kicking a bit as it rips into its prey The graveyard sprawls
endlessly under the big moon which hangs low in the sky

FADE TO BLACK
EXT TERRENCES APT BUILDING COURTYARD - MORNING
We hear Lulu the poodles bell jingling behind a bush Madame

Chretein pokes her head out her door and whistles for Lulu
The bell keeps jingling but Lulu doesnt come She calls
its name It still wont come She steps out into the
courtyard in her bathrobe and walks towards the bush calling
for the dog annoyed as its disobedience She looks behind
the bush and sees - A CROW picking at the scant remains of
Lulu ringing the collar bell with its beak She SCREAMS

INT TERRENCES APT - SAME TIME

Andy wakes up in a cold sweat naked on his Uncles couch
The phone is ringing He looks disoriented confused We
hear Madame Chretien screaming in the background

ANDY
Jesus

He sits up to get the phone and becomes dizzy - he grabs his
head He reaches for the phone and winces - theres a crusted
over FLESH WOUND on his right shoulder He picks up the phone

ANDY
Hello

SERAFINE (0OS)
(anxious concerned)
Are you okay

ANDY
No I dont think so I was having
a nightmare Wait a second

SERAFINE (0S)

ANDY

SERAFINE (0S)
Listen Im coming over Dont go
anywhere Stay right there

She hangs up Andy is very confused He sees the front door -
its ajar and the door frame has been splintered where the
deadbolt sits Stunned he stands up only to double over
with a wave of nausea He covers his mouth and runs stooped
over to the bathroom

He leans over the toilet and vomits After a few heaves his
body relaxes and he catches his breath He opens his eyes
and looks down in the bowl - horror and disbelief sweep over
his face as he focuses on

A HUMAN EYEBALL

staring back at him from the bloody water The iris is a
familiar shade of sparkling blue
ANDY
Oh no no

The doorbell rings He leaps up flushes the toilet and runs
out of the bathroom still naked to find himself in full
view of LeDuc and two UNIFORMED COPS standing in the open
door One of the cops is examining the splintered door frame

LeDuc looks to be in an even worse mood than usual His
English is rough but firm

LEDUC
Get dressed

CUT TO
INT POLICE MORGUE - MORNING

Were close on a metal body drawer A TECHNICIAN pulls it
open revealing a severed human foot nothing else

LeDuc Andy and the technician stand by the drawer in this
dreary room LeDuc never takes his eyes off Andys face

LEDUC
You recognize her

ANDY
What

Leduc looks down sees the foot and barks at the technician

LEDUC
(French)
Thats the wrong one

The technician checks his clipboard and tries another drawer
It contains a rotting ARM LeDuc curses under his breath He
and the technician start opening drawers at random peeking
in then slamming them shut

ANDY
(nervous)
You uh you want to tell me what
this is about

LeDuc ignores him continuing to open drawers The technician
appears to have found the right one at the far end

TECHINICAN
Inspector Cest le voici

A little exasperated LeDuc and Andy go over to see what the
technician has found Once again LeDuc gives him the nod

He opens the drawer to reveal

AMYS MANGLED CORPSE
Its badly lacerated Parts of her throat and midriff are

missing

and she has only one eye Andy gasps in horror

LEDUC
We know you were with her

ANDY
Oh shit No

LEDUC

(he reaches for another
drawer above Amys)
Marcel - Officer Boulard was following

ANDY
Oh no no

He pulls open the drawer to reveal MARCELS MANGLED CORPSE
Theres a gaping hole in his midsection

LEDUC
He was a good man Now his wife is a
widow
ANDY
(overcome)
This is its like a sick joke I -

LeDuc grabs Andy by the collar and slams him against the

wall

TAP TAP

LEDUC
This is not a joke Not a dream
These people are dead and -

Through the small window in the door he sees CHIEF

PICARD his superior trying to get his attention

LEDUC
Merde Wait here When I return

ANDY
But I dont remember anything I
swear
LEDUC
(sternly)

I leave these open Maybe something
comes back to you

He leaves the room The technician leaves too Andys alone
staring at the corpses Through the window he can see LeDuc
arguing loudly with his superior Andy tries to breath
deeply calm down

Suddenly

He turns back to look at Amys corpse

her eyes - well her eye - snaps open and looks
straight at him

AMY

ANDY
Aaaaa Jesus This isnt happening

Andy storms around in a fit of disbelief

AMY
You really know how to show a girl a

OUTSIDE THE ROOM

LeDuc and the Chief have stopped their argument briefly to
watch Andy stomping around gesturing wildly
their argument

The Chief rolls his eyes here we go again style

CHIEF

LEDUC

CHIEF

eight hours and all you find is a
scrawny American boy Do you have a

two hands

LEDUC
(exasperated)
I told you These murders are not
normal

INSIDE THE ROOM

Andy is still pacing the room madly

Andy blinks hard Every time he opens his eyes Marcel and
Amy are still there hideous as ever staring at him

ANDY

Andy buries his head in his hands

OUTSIDE THE ROOM

CHIEF
Are you crazy We have nothing Let

The chief leaves LeDuc scowls He looks in at Andy still
gesticulating wildly and talking to thin air LeDuc reenters
the room and looks at Andy bitterly

LEDUC
Youre free to go

Andy looks from LeDuc to the drawers and back again

ANDY

LeDuc gives him an angry stare

MARCEL
No we cant Thats the problem God

with you

Andy socks Marcel and breaks his jaw - off It skitters off
into the street He punches him in the gut - SKLURCH His
fist gets stuck in the tangle of Marcels abdominal organs

While Andy tries to pull his hand free Amy rears back and
kicks him in the balls He wrenches his hand loose and
staggers back clutching his groin

ANDY
Hey you cant kick me Youre an
apparition

AMY

What all of a sudden you got a degree
in supernatural law
Marcel fits his jaw back into place

MARCEL
Call it the power of suggestion

He socks Andy in the mouth Andy shakes it off rips Marcels
arm off bashes him in the face with it then turns around
and uses it to beat Amy over the head Meanwhile

IN AN UNMARKED POLICE CAR PARKED A HALF BLOCK AWAY

RENE and FRANCOIS the two cops who accompanied LeDuc to
Andys apartment watch Andy whirl around the sidewalk
swinging wildly at the air reacting to invisible blows and
cursing unseen enemies

RENE
(French)
You know in his own way hes
probably happier than any of us

Francois nods philosophically Meanwhile back in Andys
reality

Marcel has got him in a full Nelson and Amy is punching him
in the stomach He bucks forward wrenching both of Marcels
arms off and slams them together onto Amys head knocking
her down Andy waves Marcels arms in triumph

ANDY
Ha-ha

AMY
Oh big man You can beat up a couple
of cadavers Well let me make
something real clear asshole If
you dont kill yourself at midnight
tonight youre gonna transform and
murder innocent people

MARCEL
What are you going to be McDermott
A coward and a murderer Or a man
with guts enough to do the right
thing

The truth of this question hits home with Andy A heavy
expression falls over his face one of grave sadness but
also inner dignity He breathes deeply and exhales

Proud determined Andy arrives at the six foot wire mesh
fence and quickly scales it Amy and Marcel follow Nearby
tourists are alarmed and a clamor of concern rises up Those
with camcorders jockey for position

ANDY
All we can do is make sure its a
good one

Andy gets over the fence and stands on the small ledge Amy
and Marcel join him The tourists gasp Andy glances down at
THE PRECIPITOUS DROP He turns suddenly pale

ANDY

Andy pulls backward as hard as he can jerking Gaston off
balance Hes trying to pull them both to their deaths but
Gaston grabs a STEEL POST with his free hand

Andy hangs below the ledge pulling Gastons arm down with
all his new superhuman strength But Gaston pulls back just
as hard Andy sees The STEEL POST start to bend He looks
into Gastons FERAL STARE and understands

ANDY
It was you You son-of-a-bitch You

The POST keeps bending - its welds wont hold long

GASTON

Andy stops pulling He looks uncertain - maybe Gaston is
right But then - SNAP The post which has bent all the
way over into a J shape snaps its weld Gaston and Andy
plummet towards the ground nine hundred feet below The
tourists gasp

Using the bent pole as a hook Gaston snares a HORIZONTAL
ANTENNA which sticks out of the tower about fifty feet under
the observation deck He stops short and dangles there still
gripping Andy by the arm The tourists CHEER Meanwhile

Gaston turns and sees Serafine aiming the gun at him With
incredible speed he leaps for the window as Serafine fires
BANG The bullet catches him in the arm as he dives through
the glass BANG She fires again and misses

Gaston lands in the courtyard three stories below and runs
off with a slight limp BANG BANG Serafine fires blindly
into the courtyard after him overwrought with anger Andy

tightly desperately Serafine cant keep from crying Andy
comforts her

She embraces him again but Andy gently frees himself

ANDY

Andy hears a familiar voice behind him

CLAUDE
Two weeks ago

Andy spins around to see Claude standing by the hallway to
Terrences office Andy reaches for the gun and points it at
him

ANDY

She puts herself between Claude and the gun barrel Andy
pushes her out of the way

ANDY
Serafine Move Dont you see hes
just after the drug that ADM stuff

Claude approaches Andy speaking calmly
CLAUDE

Youre exactly right Andy I enlisted
both Serafine and your uncle to obtain
ADM And now Im counting on your
assistance too

ANDY
Why the fuck would I do that

SERAFINE
Because Andy Its a cure

ANDY
A cure

CLAUDE
A cure With ADM we can wipe out
lycanthropy the curse of the
werewolf forever

Andy is shocked stunned skeptical He bluffs with the only
card hes got

ANDY
Is that so Maybe we should go to
Saint Severin church and make sure

Claudes face changes Hes surprised

CLAUDE
Ah youve done your homework

Really Okay keep checking in

LeDuc hangs up and thinks a moment He turns the page of the
old book on his desk revealing an old woodcut illustration
of a policeman being attacked by a werewolf He frowns

INT SAINT SEVERIN CHURCH - EVENING

An evening mass is in progress The boys choir fills the
church with a solemn hymn Andy follows Claude to a narrow
staircase An OLD WOMAN gives them the evil eye and crosses
herself as they pass Claude and Andy go up the stairs and
arrive at a balcony under a magnificent wall of ancient
STAINED GLASS One of the panels catches Andys eye

ANDY
Whoa

THE PANEL shows a weird medieval ritual - a man draining
blood from another mans neck into a goblet ANOTHER PANEL
features a pentagram ANOTHER PANEL shows a huge werewolf
eating a monk under a frowning sun All the transcriptions
are in Latin Claude signals Andy to follow him

CLAUDE
The panels that concern us are over
here
(he directs Andy to a
group of panels)
Ill translate the Latin

A PANEL shows a different werewolf tied down being stabbed
in the heart by a knight under a frowning moon

CLAUDE
Then Simon did slay the demon spirit
the same as had made him unclean

THE NEXT PANEL - the knight now holds the beasts heart aloft
impaled on his dagger Where the beast was a man lies
bleeding in the background

CLAUDE
and Simon did cut out the heart of
the beast which once dead regained
the shape of a man

THE NEXT PANEL shows the beasts heart on a platter The
Hero is sitting at a table cutting into the heart with a
knife as if hes about to eat it

CLAUDE

Simon ate of the heart of the beast
and his soul was cleansed

(he turns to Andy)
These pictures are not just myth
Andy The scholars of the day used
them to record facts and enlighten
the public This is the medieval
version of a newspaper

ANDY
(skeptical)
Yeah well what if its the Weekly
World News

AMY
No Its all true Andy

Startled Andy turns to see Amy and Marcel a little worse
for wear standing behind them

AMY
I mean if by some miracle you can
find the werewolf that bit you and
then manage to eat its heart the
curse is lifted I was gonna tell
you but Marcel wouldnt let me

MARCEL

h sure it was all mean old Marcels
dea Give me a break We didnt

ell you because its a wild goose
hase Not to mention disgusting
ook

HFactkO

Marcel reaches into his own chest cavity rips out his own
slimy purple heart and thrusts it in Andys face

MARCEL
A little Grey Poupon and then Bon
appetite eh

Andy grimaces and turns back to Claude

CLAUDE
(to Amy)
I dont believe weve been introduced

ANDY
What Oh right you can see these
guys too Jesus
(he rolls his eyes)
AMY
(smiles and extends
her hand)
Amy Nice to meet you

Claude shakes her hand - SQUISH Some sort of body fluid
oozes out of Amys hand Claude frowns and discreetly wipes
his hand with a handkerchief Marcel smiles and extends his
hand

MARCEL
Marcel
(Claude smiles
politely declining
Marcels rotting
hand)
My wife has all your books

Claude nods thank you Andys had enough

ANDY

Great Later on well have to get
together for cocktails Right now I
kinda have to hurry before I grow a
lot of hair and eat people

(to Claude)
Say this heart thing works Whats
it got to do with ADM

CLAUDE
Its chemistry Andy Nothing more
Mutated antigens concentrated in the
heart of the infector unlock a vaccine-
like chain reaction in the infectee
There were not many bio-chemists
working in the twelfth century but
with todays technology its possible
to synthesize any chemical imaginable
When I discovered this ancient cure
I knew who to go to

ANDY
Uncle Terrence

CLAUDE
Yes I was able to decode the old
texts and give Terrence the
specifications It took a lot of
trial and error but finally he got
it Adenine Di-Methyloxide ADM I
call it ADAM But just before he was
attacked he hid it

ANDY
Because Gaston was after it

CLAUDE
Yes that sociopath Hes given
himself over to the evil of
lycanthropy To him ADAM is just a
threat to the terror he holds over
others To us its salvation

MARCEL
Yeah well I dont know much about
chemistry but even if this stuff
works you better find it by midnight
Otherwise its -

ANDY
Yeah I know Back to the Eiffel
Tower
(to Claude)

And what about you

CLAUDE
Believe me I wont go through another
night of that hell I have my
contingency plan right here

He removes a WHITE PILL from his coat pocket and holds it
up

CLAUDE
Sodium cyanide

The CHURCH BELLS ring The group listens tensely as the solemn
bells sound eight times

ANDY
Eight oclock Shit Youd think my
uncle would have left a clue a note
something

CLAUDE
Thats what Serafine is searching
for Without much luck Im afraid
If only we could speak with him But
alas hes off in another realm
close to death

The wheels in Andys head are turning He looks over at Amy
and Marcel He smiles Hes got an idea

MARCEL

Listen either he wastes away as a
pathetic vegetable or he can give
whats left of his life to save
hundreds of potential victims Hes
a McDermott I know what his choice
would be

SERAFINE
I suppose youre right But I still
dont like it

They stop at the door to Terrences room

ANDY
Fine You dont have to watch Stay
out here and stand guard

She nods Andy goes into
TERRENCES HOSPITAL ROOM

The lights are off Andy approaches Terrences oxygen tent
In the dim light he can barely make out Terrence through
the plastic lying motionless barely making an impression
under the sheets He looks at the body wistfully and surveys
the array of machinery thats keeping him alive Most of
the machines are plugged into a TRANSFORMER BOX on the floor

ANDY
Hey We meet again Look I know
you understand what Im about to do
here I think But I hope you forgive
me anyway

Andy takes a deep breath He leans down to the transformer
and opens the safety cover and flips the power switch All
the machines power down

Suddenly the old man in the bed sits up gasping and clawing
at the walls of the oxygen tent Oh my God Its NOT
Terrence Andy nearly soils himself diving down to fumble
with the transformer suddenly all thumbs He switches the
power on again
THE NURSE STATION

The fat sour looking duty nurse sees the alarm from the
failed life support system Shes about to call for help
when the indicator stops flashing She watches it intently
for a few seconds nothing She decides to dismiss it

TERRENCES ROOM

The old man is lying back down asleep He seems to be okay
His support machinery is functioning normally again

With a sigh of relief Andy turns and pulls back the curtain
behind him Theres Terrence sans oxygen tent hooked up to
another extensive support system

ANDY
So You moved

He pulls the curtain closed behind him and moves in close
to his uncle Terrences expression looks unmistakably morose

ANDY
You dont look happy Um I dont
usually go in for this stuff but
(He crosses himself
and says a silent
prayer)
Amen

Andy leans down opens the transformer box and flips the
power switch The machines power down - all except the EKG
monitor which shows a flat line and emits the familiar steady
tone Andy switches off the monitor Silence

Terrences body is completely still peaceful He leans down
over its face and speaks in a soft voice

ANDY
Uncle Terrence Can you hear me

Terrences body remains motionless
AT THE NURSES STATION

This time the nurse doesnt wait to respond Seeing the
indicators from Terrences room she presses the intercom

NURSE
Chambre 411 Code bleu Code bleu

IN TERRENCES ROOM

Silence Andys worried He takes his uncle by the shoulders
ANDY
Come on Skip the undead orientation
and get down here

Nothing He looks at the door nervously
OUTSIDE THE DOOR

Serafine sees a squad of doctors and nurses pushing trolleys
of emergency equipment her way from the far end of the hall
She leans her head in the door to warn Andy

INT HOSPITAL ROOM

Andy is beside himself with stress He shakes Terrences bed
a little to rouse him Nothing He tries a little harder
shake The door opens Its Serafine also in a panic

SERAFINE
Theyre coming

ANDY
Shit What have I done
(to Serafine)
Stall them Ill meet you out back

She shuts the door just in time The emergency team are
right there

SERAFINE
(feigning hysterics)
Stay away from him You butchers
Havent you done enough already

They struggle to get past her
INT HOSPITAL ROOM

Andy can hear Serafine arguing outside the door He looks
out the window to the three story drop into the alley below

OUTSIDE THE DOOR
Serafine is finally shoved aside They push the door open
INSIDE

Andy rushes to the door and pushes it shut He cranks the
DOORKNOB all the over and bends it down jamming it in the
locked position He steps away The door holds but for how
long He looks at the old man in the oxygen tent Hmm He
pushes the old mans bed up against the door

Andy forces the window open and steps out onto the ledge He
looks back at his uncle and the old guy He shrugs
apologetically then takes a deep breath closes his eyes
and jumps
OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL ROOM DOOR

The fat nurse is getting impatient with the doctors who are
attempting to pick the lock surgically She pushes them
aside and heaves her considerable heft against into the door
It opens a crack She backs up and slams it again

INSIDE THE ROOM

The nurses jolts shake the old guys bed sliding it forward
He dozes happily like a baby rocking in the cradle

EXT THE BACK ALLEY BEHIND THE HOSPITAL

Andy runs behind a nearby dumpster to avoid being seen from
the window above He kicks the wall in frustration

ANDY
Damn it

A voice calls out from behind Andy

TERRENCES VOICE
Whoa What an outrageous nightmare

Andy spins around and sees Terrence the undead version
perched atop some trash bags scratching himself

ANDY
Uncle Terrence

TERRENCE
Andy Andy is that you

ANDY
Yeah Look uncle Terrence -

Terrence mutters distractedly excitedly and quickly

TERRENCE
Andy I have to tell you about the
dream I had - or that Im still having -
it feels like a systemic physio-
tropic reaction to some drug maybe
a triptamine or phenethylamine
derivative But it is hyper-real
Id swear my legs had been cut off
or wait a second Im getting a
strange meta-physical buzz Shit
Im uh dead arent I

ANDY
Sort of

BACK IN THE HOSPITAL ROOM
The doctors have clustered around Terrences corpse The
nurse is lubricating the electro-shock paddles for the doctor
Serafine slips out the door into the hallway

SOMEONES POV spying from behind a supply cart in the hallway
(we see a hand on the cart) watches Serafine walk away
unnoticed by the doctors

BACK IN THE ALLEY

TERRENCE
Undead Right Sort of an ectocosmic
manifestation What a pisser Tell
you one thing though Timothy Leary
will be jealous as hell

ANDY
Great but listen I need to know
where you hid the ADM
TERRENCE
The ADM Be careful Andy Its very
powerful How do you know about it
ANDY
I went to St Severin church
(Terrence reacts I
see)
Now look -
IN TERRENCES ROOM

IN THE ALLEY
Terrences zombie jerks with sudden pain
TERRENCE
Oh shit No Andy dont let them

ANDY
The ADM Quickly Where is it

TERRENCES ROOM
ZZT They zap him again
IN THE BACK ALLEY

ANDY
Where is it Please

TERRENCE
AHHH The wine cellar In a bottle
of Chateau Margaux A metal
cylinder Dont Dont - AAAAH

Another zap The undead Terrence twists his face in pain In
the background Serafine appears at the mouth of the alley
Terrence croaks out a few last words

TERRENCE
Lies All lies Ahhhh

Andy turns towards Serafine then back to his uncle but
Terrence is gone

INT HOSPITAL ROOM

Terrences face is contorted with pain The EKG monitor shows
a weak but regular heartbeat The doctor pulls off his mask
and wipes his brow The other technicians congratulate him

IN THE ALLEY
Serafine approaches Andy runs up to join her

ANDY
I saw him Just before those bastards
zapped him back The ADM is in the
wine cellar in a bottle of Chateau
Margaux

SERAFINE
I didnt know he had a wine cellar

ANDY
Guess thats why he hid it there
Lets go

They run out of the alley and see GASTON jump on his hopped-
up Kawasaki enduro

SERAFINE
Oh shit He must have heard us

Gaston sees them gives them the finger and tears off down
the street

ANDY
Dammit Cmon

They run to Serafines Vespa - the tires are slashed Enraged
she kicks it over

SERAFINE
That bastard Fuck

Andy looks around desperately A GUY pulls his motorcycle
out of its parking spot and starts up the street towards
Andy Andy jumps out in front of the accelerating bike and
grabs the handlebars stopping it short sending the rider
tumbling forward over Andy He lands on his butt in the
street and starts yelling at Andy who climbs on the bike

ANDY
Sorry Ill bring it back

Serafine hops on the back and they burn rubber down the street
after Gaston Music cue CCRs Bad Moon on the Rise They
screech around the corner onto

SAINT GERMAIN BOULEVARD

Its red lights as far as the eye can see Andy grits his
teeth and accelerates towards the cluster of traffic stopped
at the first light

SERAFINE
Oh merde

She shuts her eyes as Andy zooms between the rows of stopped
cars and roars through the red light SCREECH Crossing
cars slam on their brakes and swerve to avoid the speeding
bike Andy bears down on the next red light

SERAFINE
Are you crazy

ANDY
Before Hemingway there was Starsky
and Hutch

Andy speeds through more stopped cars and runs the next red
light SCREECH More swerving cars Andy has to swerve
himself to avoid one He bears down on the next light
Meanwhile

GASTON

is stopped on his bike casually talking on a cellular phone
two red lights ahead of Andy and Serafine He hears their
bike and turns to see them zoom through the intersection in
back of him Gaston curses puts the phone in his pocket and
twists his throttle accelerating through the red light

ANDY AND SERAFINE

gain on Gaston Theyre seventy five yards behind him

GASTON

pulls a pistol and aims over his shoulder BANG He fires
back at them

SERAFINE

pulls her pistol out Both bikes roar through another red
light
A POLICE CAR pulls out onto the boulevard and turns on its
flashing lights and siren and pursues the bikes The traffic
lights turn green

Gaston leads by fifty yards The cop car pulls alongside
Andy and Serafine She discreetly pockets her gun The COP
in the passenger seat aims his gun at Andy

COP
(French)
Pull over Now

ANDY
Shit

Theres no choice They pull over GASTON speeds safely away
looking back at them and laughing The cop car stops ahead
of them and the COPS get out guns drawn

FIRST COP
(French)
Hands in the air Now

Andy and Serafine put up their hands The first cop goes
back to check the police radio which is beeping The second
cop keeps his gun aimed at Andys head Hes furious

SECOND COP
(French)
Hot shot huh You know how many
officers die in high speed chases

SERAFINE
(French)

SERAFINE

SECOND COP

Serafine curses again Andy tries to calm her down The
arguing escalates In the car the first cop is talking on
the radio

FIRST COP

He turns looks out his window and sees
RENE AND FRANCOIS

parked in their unmarked car Rene is talking with him on
the radio Francois waves

THE SECOND COP
is trying to put handcuffs on Serafine Shes still screaming
at him Hes incensed The first cop gets out of the car and
walks up to them
FIRST COP

His partner looks at him incredulous red-faced

SECOND COP
(French - to first
cop)
WHAT
FIRST COP

(ignores 2nd cop)
Drive safely

ANDY
Merci

Serafine smiles at the second cop Andy peels out races
through the red light and disappears down the boulevard The
cops watch them go then turn to each other The second cop
is apoplectic - about to explode

INT UNMARKED CAR

Rene and Francois speed off to keep pace with Andy Rene is
dialing his cellular phone As they pass the other police

car we glimpse the two cops in an angry shoving match against
the car Renes call goes through

INT SAINT SEVERIN CHURCH

LeDuc is on the balcony studying the stained glass panels
and consulting an old book The cellular phone in his coat
pocket rings An OLD PRIEST nearby frowns at him

LEDUC
(French - into phone)
Hello
(Pause)
Ill meet you there in ten minutes

He hangs up The priest is still frowning at him LeDuc shrugs
gruffly - what do you want from me and turns back to the
stained glass

As the church bells sound ten oclock we cut to different
panels Several scenes of werewolves terrorizing people A
scene where some people mix potions and dump a strange flower
into a cauldron Another shows an evil looking man shaking
his arm defiantly at a frowning sun - though he is human his
raised arm is the enlarged hairy limb of a werewolf Another
shows a saint throwing the strange flower into a fire in the
town square

LEDUC
(French)

Thank God for Saint Severin

The bells strike ten LeDuc checks his watch closes his
book and hurries off

EXT TERRENCES APT BUILDING

Music cue Evil by Howlin Wolf Gaston stops jumps off
his bike and runs into the court yard

ANDY AND SERAFINE

speed along on the bike weaving through narrow side streets
GASTON

riding the wire cage elevator in the apartment building down
to the basement He gets out and walks down the dank hallway
past several padlocked doors He stops at one with a MCDERMOTT
nameplate Hes about to shoot it off then looking around
thinks again He grabs the lock and grimacing with the
effort twists it off with his bare hands

ANDY AND SERAFINE

stuck behind a garbage truck on a narrow street Andy hops
the curb and races down the sidewalk scattering pedestrians

GASTON

flicks on the light switch in the wine cellar There are six
large racks of wine bottles He walks past them scanning
the bottles He stops at the third rack and removes a bottle
The label reads Chateau Margaux He tries to peer inside
but its too hard to see Instead he hurls it at the wall -
SMASH Wine sprays everywhere but no metal cylinder He
grabs another bottle SMASH Just wine He grabs another

ANDY AND SERAFINE

arrive in front of the apartment and hop off their bike
Serafine eyes GASTONS BIKE hatefully Andy pulls her along
SERAFINE
Wait a second

She pulls out her gun BLAM BLAM She blasts the gas tank -
WOOF The bike goes up in a fireball Serafine nods
satisfied Andy looks at her like shes nuts They rush into
the courtyard

GASTON

throws another bottle SMASH Just wine The floor is awash
in the pricey Burgundy He throws another bottle SMASH
Nothing He licks his fingers Hes enjoying this

SERAFINE AND ANDY

In the elevator going down maddeningly slowly Through the
window they can see the full moon in the sky Andy checks
his watch They look at each other nervously

GASTON

Throws another - SMASH A small METAL CYLINDER clinks as it
bounces on the floor Gaston picks it up and smiles BANG A
gunshot hits Gaston in the arm - he drops the cylinder
Serafine and Andy stand in the doorway

SERAFINE
Dirty bastard

Serafine fires again - BANG The shot misses as Gaston hits
the deck and draws his gun in one very fast motion taking
aim at Andy whos rushing towards him

GASTON
Thats far enough

Andy stops Gastons gun aimed at his chest Serafine steps
slowly towards Gaston her gun aimed at him

GASTON
(to Serafine)
Another step and hes dead

ANDY
Go ahead Serafine Blow him away

Serafine stops The three of them stand there in a close
triangle the metal cylinder on the floor between them Its
a Mexican standoff in Paris Then

CLAUDE (0S)
Drop the gun

Claude is in the doorway holding a pistol Serafine sees him
and turns back to Gaston smiling
SERAFINE
(to Gaston)
You heard him Do it

Gaston just smiles back at her Claude steps forwards and
cocks his gun against Serafines head

CLAUDE
I said drop the gun

Serafines expression turns confused horrified Andy is
shocked She drops the gun Claude picks it up and pockets
it keeping his gun on Serafine who stares at him aghast

ANDY
You bastard God I shouldve known
You wanted the cure all for yourself

GASTON
Cure Ha-ha-ha

Andy and Serafine react with confusion to Gastons outburst
Claude picks up the metal cylinder and unscrews its cap with
his free hand He slides out a vial filled with amber fluid
and holds it to up to the light He smiles

CLAUDE
No its no cure Its something
much more interesting

SERAFINE
You fucking liar

CLAUDE

(with mock alarm)
Oh did I hurt the little girls
feelings Well excusez moi I
confess my desire for ADM is quite
intense So I deceived you and our
poor friend Terry - a competent
technician but lets face it a bit
naive The great cure for
lycanthropy Hmph He didnt have
the vision to grasp the potential of
ADAM until it was too late And
even then he came rushing down to
tell me as if I would be just as
shocked Ha

He pockets the vial pulls out the white cyanide tablet
and pops it in his mouth Andy reacts with shock

CLAUDE
(off Andys look
crunching up tablet
in his mouth)
Oh this Rolaids I had a midnight
snack that disagreed with me

Serafines been doing a slow burn She explodes and lunges
at Claude knocking his gun out of his hand

SERAFINE
Fucking traitor

She picks Claude up and hurls him across the room CRASH
Claude smashes into a rack of wine bottles Serafine jumps
after him and dives on top of him pummeling him in a blind
rage Andy looks at her agog

ANDY
Wait a second

He and Gaston notice Claudes gun at the same time They
both dive for it Andy grabs it but Gaston steps on his hand
and aims his gun down at him

GASTON
You want to be cured

He cocks the gun Andy lets go of Claudes gun Gaston picks
it up and aims one gun at Andy and the other at Serafine
whos wrestling with Claude Claude throws her off and she
lands on her butt next to Andy Andy looks at Serafine

ANDY
What the fuck You too

SERAFINE
(stammering)
I I didnt think you would Im
sorry I believed that son-of-a-

bitch

Claude gets to his feet drenched with wine and smarting
from Serafines punches He walks over to Serafine and kicks
her in the face

CLAUDE
Shut up you foul mouthed little
cunt I dont have time for your
histrionics

GASTON
Give me the ADM old man

Gaston is aiming one of his guns at Claude
CLAUDE
Oh for Christs sakes Gaston Cant
you rise above the level of common

thug just this once

GASTON
Give it to me

CLAUDE
Dont be an idiot There are certain
procedures one must -

GASTON
Now

Claude sighs He takes the vial from his pocket and walks
over to Gaston

CLAUDE
Very well then

Gaston grabs the vial uncaps it and drinks it down greedily
He stands there waiting Nothing happens

ANDY
Ha Some wonder drug

GASTON
Why isnt it doing anything

CLAUDE
I told you Its not ready

Claude turns to the noise of footsteps and a walkie-talkie
in the hallway Four uniformed officers plus Rene and Francois
storm into the room guns drawn

COPS
(FrenchEnglish)
Freeze Drop your weapons Hands up

Andy and Serafine put up their hands Gaston brandishes his
guns at the cops then sees the six guns aimed at him and
drops it LeDuc walks in

CLAUDE
(French - to LeDuc)
Thank God These hoodlums tried to
rob me

LEDUC
(French - to Claude)
Put up your hands

CLAUDE
(Frenc
But surely -

LeDuc cocks his pistol and aims it at Claude

LEDUC
(French)
Now
Claude puts his hands up

CLAUDE
(French)
Whats the charge

LEDUC
(French)
There is no charge
(English)
Everybody comes in for a few
questions Everything checks out
you will go free After midnight

Claude frowns Gaston swears Andy looks at Serafine shocked
and confused She looks back at him angry and sad

CUT TO
EXT STREET - NIGHT

The cops are herding the handcuffed questionees into the
back of a reinforced paddy wagon LeDuc talks to the DRIVER
and another COP in the passenger seat

LEDUC
(French)
Godard is waiting for you at Rocherout
jail Hurry And dont stop for
anything Good luck

The driver nods It roars off lights flashing and siren
wailing LeDuc and the other cops head for their respective
cars LeDuc barks orders to an AID whos at the ready with
the car radio

LEDUC
I want four separate maximum security
cells ready Get video cameras
photographers and doctors

The aid nods and gets on the radio LeDuc checks his watch
Its 1047

CUT TO
INT PADDY WAGON
Serafine hangs her head sullenly in a quiet rage She wont
meet Andys gaze He looks over at Claude and Gaston Gaston
is restless edgy He grabs Claude by the collar and shakes

him

GASTON
Nothings happening
ANDY
Looks like he lied to you too

Claude breaks Gastons grip and shoves him back in his seat

CLAUDE
(calmly)
Relax my friend Its still not ready

Andy looks back at Serafine He shakes his head in disbelief

ANDY
Now I remember why I didnt want to
come to Paris Everyone you meet is
a goddam werewolf

Serafine stares bitterly at her feet

SERAFINE
I hope they fucking fry us all

ANDY
Yeah French fries

SLAM Hes interrupted by the sound of Gastons head snapping
back against the wall His eyes bulge wide He grins and
starts to laugh First a little Then a lot

GASTON
Yes Yes Ha Haha hahaha

He stands up laughing power-mad Suddenly his body is jerked
by a spasm and he falls to the floor Hes not laughing
anymore He flails about wildly croaking out strangled cries
gripped with a terrible seizure

IN THE FRONT CAB

The TWO GUARDS the driver and his partner hear the
commotion The guard looks over to his partner and chuckles

PARTNER
Aaooooo Heh heh heh

They both laugh The driver takes a sharp turn at high speed
IN THE BACK COMPARTMENT

Gaston flops around on the floor like a fish grabbed by a
flurry of convulsions He bites off his tongue spitting
blood everywhere Finally he goes rigid with one last
seizure then falls totally limp Andy studies the very dead
corpse

ANDY
It killed him You coulda just
used Draino Its cheaper
CLAUDE
I told him it wasnt ready

Claude takes a folded PAPER CUP from his jacket pocket He
blows into the cup to bring it back into shape He then takes
a SHARPENED STEEL TUBE from his pocket plunges it into
Gastons neck and fills the cup with the blood that pours
forth Andy and Serafine are horrified Claude puts the cup
of blood to his lips and pauses

CLAUDE
Now its ready

He swallows the cup of blood down in one gulp and sits back
to wait for the effects smiling dreamily

CLAUDE
What is the curse of the werewolf
Ill tell you The curse is to possess
such awesome power and yet be
completely unconscious of it It may
as well belong to someone else But
it wasnt always that way A thousand
years ago the Gauls had a drug
powerful enough to unlock the door
to lycanthropic consciousness to
full control It came from
moonsbreath A small white flower
once found in the hills of this
region until the thick headed crusade
by our famous Saint Severin eradicated
it for all eternity But now thanks
to ADAM the curse is over

As he says this he holds up his RIGHT ARM It begins to
mutate and grow reshaping his arm into the grotesque
powerful forelimb of the beast PLINK His swelling wrist
pops the handcuff easily

SERAFINE
(French)
Holy mother of God

ANDY
Fuck me

Claude rises to his feet triumphant He advances towards
Andy and Serafine backing them up against the rear doors of
the van He gently traces the outline of Serafines face
with his werewolf hand She bristles at his touch

CLAUDE
All my life Ive worked to unlock
the power of the unconscious mind
Well this is it This is power
ANDY
You sure its not just coz you jerk
off too much

Claude cocks his werewolf fist and SLAMS it into the back
doors inches from Andys head He leaves a deep dent and
opens the doors just a crack Its a gesture that seems
calculated to frighten them It works

Claude holds up his LEFT ARM and transforms it to match his
right It takes some effort and a little pain but he keeps
a smile on his face throughout the process

CLAUDE
Dont you see what this means Ive
broken through Im in total control
Not the moon I can do whatever the
fuck I want

SMASH Claude drives his left arm into the back doors making
another huge dent and opening the crack even wider

IN THE FRONT CAB

The cops exchange worried looks The one on the passenger
side slides open the viewing panel Claude has his back to
him

COP
(French)
Hey Whats going on in -

He stops short as Claude turns around revealing his monstrous
arms Mortified the cop reaches for the SHOT GUN under the
dash Claude races up towards the view window As the guard
pokes the muzzle through the window Claude grabs hold of

it BLAM The guards shot hits the side wall Claude rips

the gun from the guard angrily and smashes it to pieces
against the wall grinning like the devil himself

Meanwhile ANDY throws himself at the doors kicking them
trying in vain to break them open He spots the SHOTGUN BARREL
on the floor and grabs it

CLAUDE reaches through the window and grabs the guard by the
head He repeatedly smashes the guards head against the
back wall of the cab

CLAUDE
(as he smashes the
guard)
Dont you know the wolf is a
protected species

The driver freaks out seeing his partner get his head
crushed THE PADDY WAGON swerves all over the road
ANDY uses the shotgun barrel to twist open the lock on the
van doors As the vehicle swerves he drops the barrel out
the door and falls over He calls to Serafine

ANDY
I need your help Come on

She joins him and together they take a run at the back doors
The doors open a little but the lock still holds

Finished with the guard Claude turns and sees what Andy and
Serafine are up to

CLAUDE
Wait

Andy and Serafine take another run - it works THE DOORS
bust open and Andy and Serafine still handcuffed go
tumbling out into THE STREET rolling on the pavement

SCREECH HONK Cars swerve to avoid them just barely CRASH
A minivan plows into a parked car Claude watches from the
back of the van He rears his head to the moon and smiles

IN THE CAB of the paddy wagon the driver hears an unearthly
howl Its hellish Without looking away from the road he
points his pistol through the hole in the compartment He
adjusts THE MIRROR to see into the rear compartment - The
back doors are hanging open He steals a look over his
shoulder - Other than Gastons corpse its empty He
breathes a sigh of relief and turns back to the road as -

A HUGE WEREWOLF - Claude fully transformed - bursts through
the windshield and rips into him

THE PADDY WAGON is traveling over the Pont Neuf bridge A
GASOLINE TRUCK approaches from the other direction The
werewolf leaps off of the hood just as the paddy wagon
swerving all over the road hits the gasoline truck head on

KA-BOOM Both vehicles explode in a fireball smash through
the side wall of the bridge and plunge into THE RIVER

INT SQUAD CAR

LeDuc following at a distance is trying in vain to get the
paddy wagon driver on the radio

His partner slows the car Traffic ahead is snarled Its
chaos He taps LeDuc on the arm and points

Leduc sees the column of black smoke in the distance

He slams his fist against the dash angrily
CUT TO
EXT PARIS STREET NIGHT

Andy lies by the roadside dazed bruised handcuffed but
conscious He sits up unsteadily and looks for Serafine

ANDY
Serafine

He sees a small crowd of people a little further up the road
outside a small bistro He staggers up to them and pushes
his way through Serafine is there on the ground by the curb
eyes closed

Kneeling beside her he turns angrily on the onlookers

ANDY
Get out of here Go on Move it

He shoos them away Of course they just back up a bit still
gawking at the handcuffed couple

ANDY
Serafine Get up come on

Andy brushes away the hair from Serafines face He feels
her neck for a pulse - she has one But as he takes his hand
away he notices a smudge of BASE MAKE-UP has rubbed off on
his fingers He looks at the back of Serafines neck and
sees that the makeup had been covering A SCAR It bears the
unmistakable star shape of the wound Andy inflicted on the
werewolf that bit him

Horrified he stands and backs away a few feet Serafine
opens her eyes sees him

SERAFINE
(groggy)
Andy What What is it
(she sits up her
head clearing)

Andy are you okay
ANDY
It was you That night in the

tunnels You You did this to me

SERAFINE
No I Andy you cant be sure
ANDY
Thats the scar where I stabbed you
Oh God You deliberately took me
down there so you could God I

Serafine gets to her feet a little unsteadily at first

SERAFINE
You made me go there I tried to
stop you You wouldnt listen

ANDY
What was I Your idea of a fuckin
hors doeuvre Huh

SERAFINE

Shut up You fucking shut up What
do you want Huh What the hell do

She walks over grabs a steak knife from one of the outside
tables at the bistro and charges at Andy pulling open her
shirt She offers him the knife and pounds at her heart

SERAFINE
Here Come on Do it Go ahead

ANDY
What

SERAFINE
You know what Kill me Cut out my
fucking heart Go on Do it

Enraged Andy takes the knife He and Serafine lock eyes
For a second hes tempted his blood boiling heart pounding

ANDY
Youre crazy

He throws the knife aside turns and walks away

ANDY
This is all crazy

Serafine retrieves the knife and chases after him She gets
in front of him and blocks his path She holds the knife
point to her own chest

SERAFINE
The drug was a lie but the legend
in the church is true Ask the undead

Andy just stares back at her not knowing what to say Its
all too much to believe He shakes his head He tries to go
but she moves in front of him Shes determined

SERAFINE
We dont both have to die

ANDY
(softening)
I couldnt do it Not to you

He sees her looking up He follows her gaze to the FULL MOON
Its getting late Andy shudders wipes the sweat from his
brow Hes already starting to feel the heat in his blood

SERAFINE
I cant go through another night I
wont

Andy takes her hand and guides the knife away from her chest

ANDY
I know Im already burning up
Look Im not going to go through
this another night either But we
still have some time to get Claude
Hell just kill more people and
spread the curse

Shes desperate tears welling up in her eyes

SERAFINE
We cant stop him Not now
Handcuffed with no kind of weapons
Please Andy

ANDY

No We have to try Well figure
something out And if midnight comes
before we can get to him well then

(he extends a cuffed

hand)
Shake a paw

She laughs despite her tears puts her cuffed hands over his
head and hugs him tightly

SERAFINE
I know where hell go

ANDY

SERAFINE
Somewhere where there are no police

and plenty to eat

Andy looks at her He knows what shes driving at

paddy wagon from the river Ambulances wait nearby Firemen
are still putting out small piles of flaming debris

Poor Bazin and Racine At least they
brought those monsters down with

revealing the open banged-up back door with several large
FIST PRINTS in it He checks his watch - its 1132

Get headquarters on the radio

Napier isnt paid to ask questions He hops to it

NAPIER
Right away sir

CUT TO
INT UNDERGROUND PARTY - NIGHT

Andy and Serafine emerge from the tunnel wearing grim
determined expressions The party is in full swing - throbbing
beats and sweaty dancing bodies They walk straight across

the dance floor pushing their way through the crowd Amongst
the variety of freaky types here no one raises an eyebrow

at two people in handcuffs

Serafine whos scanning the room is approached by a leather
clad HIPSTER GUY

HIPSTER GUY
Serafine mon belle Ca va

He goes to kiss her on both cheeks Without breaking stride
she puts her handcuffed hands on his face and shoves sending

him reeling

Serafine points out a gang of four militant skinheads off in
a corner Andy nods and smiles

ANDY
This could be fun

They make their way to the skinheads Andy walks up to the
SKINHEAD LEADER whos got a swastika tattoo a bad
disposition and a fifty pound advantage on Andy

ANDY
I got something you want Follow me

Andy and Serafine walk into A SMALL CHAMBER off the main
space The skinhead signals his mates to come along slips
on some BRASS KNUCKLES and follows Andy into

THE CHAMBER

The skinheads surround Andy and Serafine Theres no one
else in the room The skinhead leader looks at Andys
handcuffs and sniggers

SKINHEAD
What do you got pervert

ANDY
I got Hitlers dick in a jar And
the funny thing is its still in
Goerrings mouth

The skinhead turns red with rage and throws a punch at Andys
head With lightning speed Andy grabs the skinheads fist

twists his arm around his back and hurls him across the room
He slams face first into the stone wall and collapses on the
floor with a THUD

Simultaneously the other three skinheads attack Serafine
BASHES one across the face with both fists sending him to
the floor The other gets her in a headlock from behind She
runs backwards and - SLAM - crushes him against the wall

The third skinhead tries to kick Andy in the groin Andy
grabs his boot and flips him over backwards - he actually
does a full back flip and lands on his face

The leader groggily pulls a pistol and aims it at Andy Andy
snatches it out of his hand

ANDY
Didnt even have to ask

SERAFINE
(French)
All your weapons on the floor Now

The skinheads slide out some LEAD PIPES a SWITCHBLADE
another PISTOL and an army surplus GRENADE Andy and Serafine
scoop them up except the lead pipes

ANDY
Neo-Nazis Ya gotta love ‘em
(to the Skinheads)
Merci beau coup monsieurs

CUT TO
INT TUNNEL - NIGHT

Music cue After Midnight (were gonna let it all hang out)
Andys gun is pressed against the chain on Serafines
handcuffs - BANG The chain is broken BANG She returns the
favor and his chain is broken

They walk into the DRIPPING dank tunnel away from the party
which fades away in the background Each carries a pistol
and a flashlight BEADS OF SWEAT appear on their foreheads

The tunnel tilts downhill Heavier DRIPPING They turn a
corner and

SLAM Something barrels into them - its a HYSTERICAL GIRL
Shes about nineteen and splattered with blood She SCREAMS
uncontrollably Serafine holds her by the shoulders trying
to calm her

GIRL
(French)
Ahhhhhhhh A monster My God It got
my boyfriend Noooooo

SERAFINE
Ou Ou est le monstre

GIRL
Ahhhh Let me go Let me gooooo

Shes off the deep end flailing at Serafine who keeps trying
to calm her down Theres no time for this Andy presses his
gun to her temple She shuts up and stares at him with wide
terror stricken eyes

ANDY
(calm firm)
Ou est le monstre

She points back down the tunnel she came out of
GIRL
(French)

Down the stairs

ANDY
Merci

He lets her go She starts SCREAMING again and continues on
disappearing into darkness Andy winces and holds his ears
SERAFINE
No wonder he let her go

ANDY
Really

They run in the direction she pointed They arrive at the
intersection with A STAIRWAY to the right They start down
it They see something up ahead -

SOMEONES HAND is sticking out on the ground from a passage
at a landing on the staircase

SERAFINE
Her boyfriend

The hand moves a bit pulls back and disappears into the
crossing passage

ANDY
Hes alive Cmon

They hurry down to the landing shine their light into the
passage The hand is severed and A BIG RAT is dragging it
along with some difficulty A dozen or other rats munch on
scraps of flesh scattered over a grisly mess of blood and
body parts Andy and Serafine stare at it for a moment
Suddenly Andy looks away

ANDY
God I cant believe it

SERAFINE
What

ANDY
(disturbed)
Its making me hungry

A beast HOWL echoes through the tunnels Serafine shines he
flashlight on some bloody beast footpaw prints leading down
the stairs

They follow the bloody prints down the stairs and come to an
ancient ARCHED DOORWAY with a skull set in the arch anda
chiseled inscription Andy points to the inscription

ANDY
What does it say

SERAFINE
(reading)
Stop Beyond this passage lie the
catacombs of Paris the exclusive
domain of the dead

Andy gestures back to the bloody remains
ANDY
Well say were with him

They walk through the gate and enter
THE CATACOMBS

Andy shines his flashlight around illuminating two large
tunnels which lead into a twisting intestinal maze lined
from floor to ceiling with HUMAN SKULLS and FEMURS The bones
form the building blocks of the tunnel walls and are arranged
in various patterns - from crucifixes to Masonic pyramids

and even pentagrams Ground water seeps from the ceilings

and walls DRIPPING over the eroded crumbling bones

Despite the situation Andy cant help but be dumb struck by
the spectacular necropolis

ANDY
Whoa

SERAFINE
After the revolution the Paris
cemeteries overflowed They dug up
all the old bodies and brought them
here Seven million people Mostly
very poor

ANDY
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of
paupers

SERAFINE

Well they are French

ANDY
Right

Another eerie HOWL echoes through the maze Andy looks down
both main tunnels - the howl seems to come from each of them

ANDY
These tunnels must loop around and
connect
SERAFINE
Lets go from both ends Well cut
him off
Andy considers this
ANDY

Okay Be careful

SERAFINE
You too
She kisses him Theyre both sweating heavily now She starts
off to the right He watches her go for a moment and then
walks down the other skull lined tunnel

CUT TO
EXT PETIT PONT - NIGHT

The CHARRED BODIES of Gaston and the two cops lie on the

river bank near the wreck LeDuc surveys them with a few
other cops Napier leans out of a nearby car with a radio
handset The bells of nearby Notre Dame begin to ring

NAPIER
(French)
Its headquarters sir They got a
report

LeDuc rushes over and grabs the handset

LEDUC
(French - into radio)
Whatve you got

DESK OFFICER (VO)
Just a crazy call from a girl
probably fucked up on drugs I
wouldnt bother you but you said
call with anything unusual

LEDUC
What did she say

DESK OFFICER (VO)
Something about a monster
underground in the catacombs under
Place Denfert

LEDUC
I need two tactical assault squads
at Place Denfert immediately You
can tell the commissioner its a
code red

DESK OFFICER (VO)
But Inspector this girl I wouldnt
call her reliable

LEDUC
Now

DESK OFFICER (VO)
Yes sir

LeDuc throws the handset back at Napier The church bells
strike twelve
CUT TO
INT CATACOMBS

Andy walks along carefully shining the flashlight ahead of
him his gun at the ready His breathing gets heavier His
face gets redder More sweat His heart pounds in his ears

The tunnel follows a serpentine path with many smaller
passages and anterooms off to the sides

Andy sees some flickering light reflecting off the wet skulls
up ahead He approaches it Its coming out of AN ANTECHAMBER
He holds his gun out in front of him and steps quietly He
peers into the antechamber and finds

TWO HALF EATEN BODIES

Its the old hag and the wino he saw in the tunnels at the
first party Theyve been killed very recently - blood still
drips from their gaping wounds

He kneels over the winos body Theres a big chunk missing
from his neck Andy stares at the BLOODY FLESH transfixed
He shudders with a sudden spasm His breathing gets quicker
More sweat He reaches towards the wound his hand shaking
and touches the flesh Blood runs down his fingers He slowly
brings his hand back towards his mouth

TERRENCE (0S)
Dont do it Andy Fight it with
everything youve got

Andy looks up to see UNCLE TERRENCE stumps and all sitting
across from him

ANDY
Uncle Terrence youre

TERRENCE
Yeah I finally checked out thank
God But theres a bit of unfinished
business

ANDY
Claude

TERRENCE
I never thought Id ask this of
anyone Andy but do me a favor and
kill the evil son-of-a-bitch will
you

A SNARL cuts him off Andy jumps up steps out into the main
tunnel and shines his light
THE BEAST

rounds a curve and comes into view about thirty yards away
Its running straight at Andy and closing fast Andy aims
the gun BANG A miss - the bullet shatters a skull on the
wall BANG Another miss BANG The bullet hits the beast in
the shoulder It stumbles but keeps coming BANG A miss
Andy aims carefully

ANDY
Cmon you mother

BANG A direct hit in the chest The beast falls Snarling
in pain

BANG Andy blasts again but the beast drags itself to the
safety of a recessed area off the tunnel out of Andys line
of fire Andy walks forward listening to the horrible wails
of the beast thrashing around in a puddle on the floor

Andy aims his gun and his flashlight as he nears the corner
of the recess The wailing and thrashing settles down Andy
proceeds cautiously He rounds the corner and shines the
light on

SERAFINE
naked bleeding from bullet wounds in the chest shoulder
and neck She lies still Andy sighs with anguish He drops

to his knees

ANDY
No Oh God

He puts down his gun and cradles her head in his hands Shes
breathing - just barely She looks into his eyes Her voice

is weak

ANDY
Oh God Shit

SERAFINE
Andy

She reaches up feebly and manages to grab the SWITCHBLADE
from his back pocket She clicks it open and hands it to

Andy

SERAFINE
Do it

Andys shaking shuddering - his breathing erratic

ANDY
No Its over

He shakily presses the gun to his own head
TERRENCE (0S)
Dont Andy Stop Claude

Andy looks up Terrence Marcel Amy and a dozen other
mutilated rotting undead presumably Serafines victims
stand in the tunnel looking on solemnly

MARCEL (OS)
Either way works for us

AMY
But you better hurry

Claudes stentorian voice echos from beyond a curve in the
tunnel

CLAUDE (0S)
You cant turn back Andy

CLAUDE

in human form walks towards the glow from Andys flashlight
around the bend His naked body is taut and muscular - it
looks thirty years younger than it should His face is younger
too - he looks the picture of a powerful young warrior

CLAUDE
Man is something to be surpassed A
rope stretched over the abyss between
the animal and the Superman Neitzche
was right Andy And now I have
crossed that abyss I am no longer
man OR beast but man AND beast
ADAM has lived up to its name I am
the first new man and my God it is
FUCKING MAGNIFICENT Youre already
half way there Andy Feel the power
in your veins With ADAM you could
harness it Master it Let it
transform you into something more
glorious than your wildest dreams

ANDY

is shaking violently - on the brink of transforming Serafine
raises the blade to him again Shes fading fast

SERAFINE
Dont let me die for nothing

Andy winces with pain - his brow bulges his teeth enlarge
the transformation is starting Uncle Terrence is worried

TERRENCE
Andy
CLAUDE

still walking The light is getting brighter - hes almost
around the bend Hes buzzing with a scary kind of euphoria

CLAUDE
The choice is yours Andy deny your
own blood die an unfulfilled child
or face the challenge of mind and
body united at last Which will it
be

He rounds the corner and sees Andy hunched over Serafines
body He keeps walking

CLAUDE
Dont be confused by old beliefs
This is beyond mere words like good
or evil You have to feel it

ANDY

whips around BLOOD streaming from his mouth gun aimed
grip rock solid his features back to normal eyes locked on
the beast with determined controlled rage

ANDY
Feel this

BLAM BLAM He pumps out two shots One hits Claude in the
upper left part of his CHEST The other hits his CHEEK exits
at the back of his jaw and shatters the cheekbone of A SKULL
on the wall behind him He screams in pain and dives for
cover into a SMALL INTERSECTING TUNNEL

Andy gets up pausing for a second to look back at Serafines
face It looks peaceful The undead are gone He starts after
Claude

CLAUDE

sits leaning against a wall of skulls The face wound is
bleeding but not mortal

CLAUDE
Stupid boy

With an awesome rage he grimaces and starts to TRANSFORM HIS
LEFT SIDE - his muscles swell around the chest wound and THE
BULLET actually squeezes out of the hole and falls to the
ground The wound closes up as the flesh keeps morphing and
growing hair

ANDY

creeps around the corner gun and flashlight aimed towards
the small tunnel
When the flashlight beam falls on Claude hes in mid pounce
rocketing at Andy with bad intent BANG Andy gets off a
shot - it hits Claude in his THIGH as he tackles Andy

They wrestle Claude in mid-transformation his left side
further along hairier his facial bones shifting His thigh
swells and ripples and THE BULLET SQUIRTS OUT of its wound

His left arm mostly transformed grips Andys gun hand
BANG Andy squeezes off a shot blowing off the tip of
Claudes transforming THUMB

CRUNCH Claude clamps his vice like grip and crushes the
gun Andy wrenches his hand away as Claude hurls him off
like a rag doll

Andy flies through the air and SMASHES into the tunnel wall
The wall of ancient SKULLS and BONES shatters and collapses
around Andy - burying him in ossified fragments

Andy lifts himself out of the pile and looks at Claude who
lies on the floor finishing his transformation His right
side is catching up with his left and his head is now more
beast than human All the while he glares at Andy and doesnt
appear vulner able

Andy takes advantage of the moment to get the hell away - he
runs into the tunnel leaving Claude behind to finish
transforming

Andy makes a few quick turns through the maze - it seems he
has evaded Claude for the moment He pulls the GRENADE from
his pocket turns off his flashlight and pads along softly
listening for the beast

Suddenly a sharp sound from behind him makes Andy jump

VOICE
(French - screaming)
STOP WHERE YOU ARE HANDS UP

Andy turns around A scared COP is aiming his gun at him
shining a flashlight in his face Andy puts his hands up

COP
(English)
Its you You should be dead in that
wreck with Bazin and Racine

ANDY
Shhh Be quiet man Were not alone -

COP
Shut up Save your stories The only
thing I want to hear is you begging
for your life I want to see you
suffer like they did

(he sees Andys look

of terror)
Haha Youre scared now eh Come
on Wheres the scary monster now
huh Ha ha Well see who -

A ROAR cuts him off The cop spins around - the beam from
his flashlight flooding THE BEAST with light as it springs
through the air at him Andy runs

COP
(French)
My God

He gets off one shot - it hits the beast in the arm but

its too late The beast clamps its massive jaw onto the
cops neck and bites his head clean off THE HEAD rolls across
the floor and comes to rest in a pile of skulls

CUT TO
SERAFINES BODY

In the tunnel Two queasy cops stand over it LeDuc approaches
them

LEDUC
(French)
What have you got

COP
(French - disturbed)
Its the girl Someone cut out her
heart
LEDUC
(Matter of factly)
Good
The cops look at him like hes nuts

CUT TO

ANDY

is crouched at a corner of two catacomb tunnels grenade
clutched in his hand He hears something and carefully peers
around the corner

ANDYS POV
At the end of the long tunnel of bones the beast lurks at
another intersection sniffing the air and growling some

forty yards away

Andy ducks back around the corner He holds up the grenade
pulls the pin and whispers a quick prayer

ANDY
(to himself)
Just throw a strike

With a determined grunt he pitches the grenade around the
corner and then ducks back Suddenly the beasts growling
stops Andy grits his teeth and closes his eyes awaiting
the explosion Just silence Then a small skittering sound
close by He opens his eyes

THE GRENADE
skitters to a stop a couple of feet from him

ANDY
Shit

He bolts and gets five steps from it when

KA-BOOM It explodes behind him launching him through the
air along with a spray of bones and rubble He lands twenty
feet away and clutches his left leg wincing in pain

ANDY
Ahh Son of a bitch

LEDUC
and the cops turn towards the sound of the blast

LEDUC
(French)
Lets go

ANDY

struggles to his feet He clicks on his flashlight and sees
the blast has caved in the tunnel- a wall of rubble seals
Andy off from the beast

Andy breaths a sigh of relief At least hes got time He
starts limping away from the wall of rubble

SMASH The rubble explodes again as the beast crashes through
it like a freight train sending rocks and bones flying

Andy runs as fast as he can with his bad leg The beast closes
in on him quickly Andy jumps up for a NARROW OPENING in the
tunnel ceiling He grabs the metal rung inside and pulls
himself up into the vertical shaft as the beast pounces The
beast catches Andys foot with its claw Andy pulls out of

his sneaker and just barely eludes the beasts grasp

Andy climbs up the metal rungs in this old service shaft -
barely wide enough for his body The beast claws and gnashes
his teeth at the opening but cant fit in - for now
Andy reaches an iron grate pushes it up and crawls out into
ANOTHER DRIPPY TUNNEL

Like the ones near the party - no skulls Theres a lot of
water in this one It looks familiar

CLAUDE

is transforming back into human shape His face is now more
human than beast He screams into the vertical passage ina
growling not quite human voice

CLAUDE
You have no advantage Andy My body
has no limits

ANDY

looks around in the tunnel He sees something (we dont) He
limps off towards it

CLAUDE

in his human shape crawls into the vertical service passage
and climbs up the rungs

Claude emerges from the shaft into the dark tunnel Andys
no where in sight We hear only dripping water

CLAUDE
So this is how you choose to die
Hiding like a scared rabbit Just
praying I dont find you

ANDY

crouches under a concrete ledge in a very dark space Claudes
voice sounds distant echoey and competes with the closer
sound of trickling water

CLAUDE (0S)
Well I assure you your nervous sweat
glands will give you away soon enough
my trembling little rabbit

CLAUDE

begins transforming He falls to the ground and groans with
joyous pain as his body noisily transforms

CLAUDE
AHHHH ITS FUCKING GLORIOUS
AAAARRGGGHHH
ANDY
huddles in his hiding place looking out into the darkness
ANDY
(to himself)

Cmon already

A glint of light appears in a puddle on the ground Andys
eyes widen

CLAUDE

His head is transforming - his exaltations become more
animalistic

CLAUDEBEAST
RRAAAAAARRRRRRGGG

LEDUC

still in the catacombs hears Claudes yell echo through the
tunnels He thinks it came from above He runs towards a
stairway

THE BEAST

Claude is fully transformed He sniffs the air locks in on
a scent and sets off through the tunnel

ANDY

watches intently as the light in the puddle gets brighter
It starts reflecting on the wet concrete walls of this tunnel

ANDY
(to himself)
Now

Andy clicks on the flashlight shines it at himself and
yells for all hes worth

ANDY
HEY YOU DIRTY EVIL FUCK CMON AND
GET ME I DARE YOUR UGLY ASS (etc)

THE BEAST

cocks its head towards Andys taunts The sound of flowing
water is close by The beast pounces towards Andys voice
into

THE WET SLIPPERY STAIRWAY

that Andy slid down that first night in the tunnels The

beast loses its footing and slips helplessly down the slick
eroded stone GROWLING furiously
LEDUC
runs down a tunnel towards Andys screaming voice The beam
of his flashlight illuminates the landing ahead of him
halfway down the stairwell He sees THE BEAST slide by
clawing in vain for a grip

A METRO TRAIN

screams around the bend lighting up the whole metro tunnel
Andy is still SCREAMING from his refuge under a ledge

THE BEAST

shoots out of the stairwell and lands on the tracks It looks
up frozen for a split second - its horrible snarling face
is caught in the speeding trains harsh glare

SMASH Impact The beast is sucked under the wheels and
ground to bits between track and wheels

LEDUC

at the landing looks down the stairwell as the train rushes
past

ANDY

huddled next to the passing train clenches his fist in
victory

ANDY
Yes

The train passes Andy gets up and shines his flashlight
around the ground The beasts body lies in chunks smears
and puddles The parts begin morphing back into Claudes
human forms - A THIGH here A PIECE OF SPINE there

LEDUC inches his way down the last few feet of the stairway
using the rusty pipe for a handhold He walks up with his
flashlight and aims it at the BEASTS HEAD which finishes
turning back into Claudes head

LeDuc glances at Andy He takes a small envelope from his
pocket and shakes out a single SILVER BULLET He loads it
into his gun and FIRES straight into Claudes lifeless head

LEDUC
(to Andy)
I always wanted to do that I saw it
in a movie

ANDY
What about me
LEDUC
My men think you died and floated
away in the Seine If I wanted to I
could let them believe that
(a long pause)
But that would be illegal

Andy looks at him carefully trying to read him LeDucs
face is impassive

CUT TO

INT COURTROOM NIGHT

The prosecutor who speaks English with a thick French accent
has an extremely sarcastic look on his face He wheels around
dramatically and confronts Andy who sits uneasily on the
stand wiping the sweat from his brow

PROSECUTOR

You intend us to believe that you
committed these murders because the
moon was full and you were somehow
magically transformed into a huge
powerful beast with an insatiable
appetite for human flesh is that
right

ANDY
You dont understand

The prosecutor turns away towards the jury to mock Andy
PROSECUTOR
Oh So I dont understand You think
its me who has a hard time coming
to grips with reality
The JURORS snigger at Andys expense But wait suddenly
they look concerned - somethings wrong The prosecutor
continues his back to Andy
PROSECUTOR
You think Im the one who needs my
head examined I dont understand
Well Mr McDermott enlighten me
He wheels around to Andy and comes face to face with
THE BEAST

huge and ravenous It goes for his throat

PROSECUTOR
Good God Aaaaaaaa

The beast tears the prosecutor apart spraying blood
everywhere The jury - oddly enough - break into polite
applause One less lawyer

CUT TO
INT AIRPLANE - NIGHT

Andy wakes up with a start - a concerned STEWARDESS is leaning
over him Disturbed PASSENGERS crane their necks peering at
him like hes nuts

STEWARDESS
You were screaming in your sleep
sir Are you okay

Andy looks around getting his bearings He takes a deep
breath and shakes it off

ANDY
Yeah It was just um something I
ate

The stewardess nods and smiles a little uneasily He picks
up the Bloody Mary from his table and gulps some down A
little bit of tomato juice dribbles down his chin He looks
out the window

EXT AIRPLANE

It flies along over a blanket of clouds past the huge silver
moon The song is Cat Stevens Moonshadow sardonically
covered by Nirvana with the oh so appropriate lyrics If I

ever lose my legs
