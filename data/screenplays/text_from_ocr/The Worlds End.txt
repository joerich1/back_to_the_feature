WORLD

END
GARY (V0O)
Ever had one of those nights that
starts like any other night but
ends up being the best night of
your life I did

INTEXT 1990 - DAYNIGHT

Over corridors school children and falling A4 paper The

images match the narration warm with nostalgia

GARY (V0O)
It was June 22nd 1990 our final
day of school There were five of
us Oliver Chamberlain Peter Page
Steven Prince Andy Knightley and
me They called me The King
Because my names Gary King

We see a teenage GARY the school cool cat with trendy hair

black trench coat and irrepressible grin

GARY (V0O)
Me and the boys we were
inseparable Ollie was funny he
fancied himself as a bit of a
player but really he was all
mouth We called him O-Man because
he had a birthmark that looked like
a six He loved it

We see a teenage OLIVER a yuppie in training with city boy
accessories and a brick of a mobile phone The boys try to
distract him He gives them the finger mouths Fuck off

GARY (V0O)
Pete was the baby of the group We
sort of took him under our wing
Pete wasnt the kind of kid wed
usually hang out with but he was
good for a laugh and his dad was
minted

Diminutive PETER gets nudged in the corridor by a BURLY KID
In Peters garden Gary cannonballs into a swimming pool

soaking an older man who is apparently Peters dad

GARY (VO)
Steve was a cool guy almost as
cool as me We jammed together
formed a band we chased the girls
(MORE )

( )

GARY (VO) (CONTD)
I think he kinda saw us as rivals
Sweet really

Young STEVEN is handsome We see him smoking with Gary and
jamming on guitars in the music room Gary and Steven watch

the same PRETTY GIRL walk past them

GARY (VO)
And Andy Well what can I say Andy
was my wing man The one guy I
could rely on to back me up I
loved him and Im not being funny
he loved me too

GARY (V0O)
There were a few people wed miss
Mr Shepherd was cool I remember
one time he asked what I wanted to
do with my life

MR SHEPHERD sits across from Gary in a careers office

GARY (V0O)
I told him I just want to have a
good time He thought that was
funny It wasnt meant to be

We see their home town from above A nondescript garden city

set out in symmetrical circles of grey and green

GARY (V0O)
Newton Haven was our hometown Our
cradle our playground our
universe and that night it was the
site of an heroic quest The aim
To conquer The Golden Mile Twelve
pubs along a legendary path of
alcoholic indulgence terminating
at the alehouse that would herald
our success The Worlds End

The aerial view merges into a TOURIST MAP of Newton Haven
The boys crowd around it charting the route with blue

markers

GARY (VO)
There was The First Post The Old
Familiar The Famous Cock The
Cross Hands The Good Companions
The Trusty Servant The Two Headed
Dog The Mermaid The Beehive The
Kings Head The Hole in the
Wall

( )

The old-fashioned pub signs flash past like tarot cards

GARY (VO)
all before reaching our destiny

The Worlds End appears the most important pub of all

GARY (V0O)

We took my car into town I called

it The Beast because she was pretty

hairy

Gary drives a MATT BLACK GRANADA MK2 dangerously fast

GARY (V0O)

And so our attempt at The Golden

Mile began We were off We didn’t

waste any time We hit pub one and

we hit it hard

They enter The First Post The boys sit at a table and all
down their pints together

GARY (V0O)
Things got crazy fast There was
drinking there was fun

The boys down pint after pint in successive pubs Steven
chats with a GRIZZLED OLD DRINKER The others laugh

GARY (VO)
there was controversy

A publican holds a red card up to Gary who protests

GARY (V0O)
there were ladies

They flirt with THREE ALLURING SCHOOLGIRLS two with blonde
hair one with red

GARY (VO)
there was drama and of
course

Gary in a pub toilet punching the wall in frustration

GARY (VO)
there was drinking

The boys raise a toast together in The Good Companions

( )

GARY (VO)
After pub five we were feeling
invincible and decided to procure
some herbal refreshment from a man
we knew as The Reverend Green

The boys buy hash from a SHIFTY LOOKING DEALER Oliver too
drunk to carry on throws up and waves them away

GARY (VO)
Pint six put O-Man out of action
so we carried on without him Good
thing I bumped into his little
sister in the next pub we went
into the disabled toilets and I
bumped into her again

We see Gary with the same pretty girl he and Steven checked
out earlier Gary winks at a jealous Steven

GARY (V0O)
Sam tagged along for a while but in
the end I had to let her go I told
her I had another date that night
and her name was Amber

The boys clash pints The boys have reached The Beehive

GARY (VO)
Nine pints in and it was us against
the world least it felt like it

Drinks are spilt a brawl starts Andy is in the center

GARY (V0O)
After the Beehive we had to lay
low and so we repaired to the bowls
club or as we liked to call it The
Smokehouse And that’s when it all
went fuck up

The boys approach a BOWLING GREEN CLUBHOUSE to smoke pot
GARY (V0O)
Everyone got para and Pete chucked
a whitey so we had to bench him
We see them leave a comatose Peter on a park bench
GARY (V0O)
In the end we blew off the last

three pubs and headed for the
hills

( )

Gary Andy and Steven stagger along a dark street

GARY (V0O)
We thought about taking The Beast
but eventually decided against it

The Beast crashes into a low wall steam rising

GARY (VO)
Don’t know how we got up there in
the end Maybe Lady Luck was with
us after all

Gary Andy and Steven sit on a hilltop and look out across
Newton Haven A SHOOTING STAR streaks across the sky Andy
puts an arm round Gary It is the beautiful idyll of youth

GARY (VO)
I remember sitting up on top of
that hill blood on my knuckles
beer down my shirt sick on my
shoes seeing the orange glow of a
new dawn break and knowing in my
heart life would never feel this
good again And you know what

INT MEETING ROOM - NIGHTDAY

We see Gary King age 40 Lines of experience etched across
his face but with the same broad smile

GARY
It never did

A strangely self-satisfied Gary leans back in his chair Hes
still thin drawn even with dyed black hair

Gary is among a group of people sitting in a circle A
bemused silence settles as the people regard Gary and each
other We hear the WELL SPOKEN VOICE of a male GROUP LEADER

GROUP LEADER
Thank you Gary That was very
enlightening Would anyone like to
add anything or maybe challenge
Gary

PALE YOUNG MAN
Are you disappointed

GARY
About what

( )

PALE YOUNG MAN
That you didnt make it to The
Worlds End

Close on Gary Yes Yes Yes

GARY
No

Gary zones out We hear the following movie dialogue

PASTOR (VO)
Just what is it that you want to
do

PETER FONDA (VO)
We want to be free We want to be
free to do what we want to do And
we want to get loaded And we want
to have a good time And thats
what were going to do Were going
to have a good time Were going to
have a party

TITLE CARD - ‘THE WORLD’S END’

MONTAGE VARIOUS SUBURBAN DOMESTIC and WORKPLACE LOCATIONS
Primal Scream’s ‘Loaded’ plays over a montage of domesticity

amid the pandemonium of a family breakfast

STEVEN older well preserved He is in sweats working out
with an attractive young female fitness instructor

OLIVER in a slick business suit in line at a coffee shop
talks loudly on his bluetooth headset and annoys others

into a fancy elevator briefcase in hand
EXT PETER’S HOUSE - MORNING

A garage door opens We see Peter at the wheel of a midpriced
family car As he pulls out of the garage he sees-

EXT STREETS OF NEWTON HAVEN - DAY

So Young by Suede plays as the group swagger along in
slowmo VARIOUS PASSERSBY regard them with mild indifference

Newton Haven in all its underwhelming glory Floral displays
ring roads neat avenues They walk past FIVE TEENAGE BOYS
and see a reflection of their former selves Gary nods to
them as if they have something in common

Gary rings someones doorbell and runs off forcing the
others to do the same Gary laughs they dont

EXT THE FIRST POST - MOMENTS LATER
Gary poised one foot up on a picnic table like a tour guide

GARY
Until 1840-

ANDY
For fucks sake

GARY
-this building was the site of
Newton Havens first Post Office
Then an enterprising business
fellow decided that far from
benefitting matters of the sending
and receiving of mail it was
better suited as a humble tap-room
where one could get twatted

( )

Gary nods sagely and opens the door with a flourish to-

INT THE FIRST POST - CONTINUOUS

-the shittiest chain pub you’ve ever seen It’s completely

without charm or atmosphere Gary smiles

GARY
It’s like déja vu

PETER
I dont remember this at all Has
it been refurbished

STEVEN
Must have been bought by a chain

OLIVER
Yes its part of that nationwide
initiative to rob small charming
pubs of any discernible character

STEVEN
Starbucking man Its happening
everywhere

GARY
Cant take away that smell though

INT THE FIRST POST TABLE - LATER

The group sits at the same table from the prologue Gary
looks at Andy sipping his water and shakes his head

GARY
I cant believe this a man of your
legendary prowess drinking fucking

( )

OLIVER

ANDY
You seriously have a problem with
me not drinking after what

GARY
I dont but King Arthur does

OLIVER

Do you think King Arthur would have
come back from the Battle Of
Hastings fucking rocked up at
Arthur’s Castle-

OLIVER
Camelot

GARY
- gone to the bar and ordered a tap
water

STEVEN

No because they wouldn’t have had
running water in Arthurian times

GARY
Exactly He would have ordered a
mead The King Arthur of beers

PETER
Mead’s a honey wine isn’t it
ANDY
And I’m less of a man because I
choose to drink water

GARY
It’s a bit ‘ooh ducky’ innit

PETER
That’s not very PC Gary

( )

GARY
Get out of the nineties mate

ANDY

Listen there’s nothing ‘ooh ducky’
about being teetotal about walking
into a pub after a rubgy match and
ordering a tap water at a bar
packed with big ugly bastards
wearing war paint That Gary takes
confidence I’m talking balls

GARY
You said it poof

ANDY

EXT STREETS OF NEWTON HAVEN - LATER

The guys walk to the next pub They pass an obtrusive BRONZE
SCULPTURE in the centre of the park It’s a Henry Moore-like

humanoid figure but with long jagged limbs

STEVEN
What the hell is that

ANDY
Modern art

INT THE FAMOUS COCK - MOMENTS LATER

Fools Gold by The Stone Roses is playing The gang lingers
at the bar Gary is trying to get served

GARY
When youre ready mate

PUBLICAN 3 serves another customer first

GARY
Oh shit Look who it is

Gary points to a GRIZZLED OLD DRINKER from the prologue He
is at the bar drinking his lager through a crazy straw

ANDY
Basil

GARY
Mad Basil Dyou remember We used
to sit in here for hours and listen
to his crazy stories about UFOs and
lizard people and underwater Nazis

OLIVER
Didnt he spout some bullshit about
the Bermuda Triangle actually being
a square

STEVEN
No he said it was two Isosceles
Triangles forming a rhombus

GARY
He was your best mate wasnt he
Steve

STEVEN

He wasnt my best mate He was just
a lonely old man and I felt sorry
for him

GARY
That’s right
(shouts )
BASIL

BASIL turns around Gary waves and points at the group Basil

ANDY
Maybe were not the local legends

PUBLICAN 3 (0S)
Gary King

GARY
Speak for yourself

PUBLICAN 3

The Publican indicates a wall of shame We see photos of
angry drunks Among them a smiling young Gary thumbs aloft

EXT THE FAMOUS COCK - MOMENTS LATER
The group leaves with Gary shouting back through the door

GARY
Cmon this is fucking ridiculous

PETER
Have two in the next one

ANDY
He can have them all in the next
one for all I care

GARY
Weve got to have one in every pub
or the whole things fucked

OLIVER
Id say it was fairly fucked
already

They leave Gary behind He spots three glasses of lager on a
picnic table the sum of the dregs add up to a pint We hear
the Stone Roses singing Foooooools Gold

ANDY
How much more of this do we have to
endure

STEVEN

That was three Theres nine more

OLIVER
Oh good

( )

ANDY
Fuck this I need to eat something

PETER
We could get something in the next
pub

STEVEN
As long as it’s reasonably healthy

OLIVER
This is Newton Haven Not exactly
the heart of the organic
revolution

STEVEN
I doubt its the heart of anything

ANDY
My wife wanted us to go organic
problem is I like eating shit

Gary is suddenly back with them and running on ahead

GARY
The next pub does shit Keep up

Angle on the picnic table the three glasses now empty

INT THE CROSS HANDS - EVENING

This pub is much busier and seems friendlier The
sipping their drinks and eating chunky chips

STEVEN
I remember this one

GARY
We had New Years here

PETER
89 into 90

OLIVER
Wasnt that when you fell asleep on
the pool table Andy

ANDY

OLIVER

44

They all smile and laugh in recollection Gary spots the same
FIVE TEENAGE BOYS at the pool table

GARY
Yeah and when you woke up we told
you it was 1991 and you got all
freaked out and punched a clock

PETER
That was a great night

ANDY
Didn’t you manage to get off with
Erica Leekes Peter

PETER

triumph if I say so myself

OLIVER
She of the Marmalade Sandwich fame

PETER

OLIVER
Erika Leekes Tracy Benson and
Becky Salt Two blondes and a
redhead in the middle

GARY
The Marmalade Sandwich

ANDY

OLIVER

ANDY
What do you mean

OLIVER
Well sitting at that table over
there are two blondes with a
redhead in the middle

GARY
Shut the fuck up

( )

Sitting with their backs to them are three women Two with
blonde hair one with red We can’t see their faces

OLIVER
Id say that’s Erica Leekes on the
left Tracy Benson on the right and
by process of elimination Becky
Salt in the middle The Marmalade
Sandwich All growed up

PETER
That is very spooky

GARY
Lets get them over

Gary stands to go over Andy pulls him back down

ANDY
No lets not get them over I dont
want to see an old Becky Salt I

stored up here for special
occasions

GARY
Gym kit

ANDY
School uniform

GARY
Classic

Gary again stands to call them over Andy yanks him down

ANDY
Sit the fuck down and leave the
past where it is Its bad enough
having to look at your old mugs
Becky Salt Ill stick with the
20th century version thank you

GARY

You make it sound like were
ancient We havent changed that
much Sure Steves let himself go
but Petes got the same haircut and
O-Man still has his Mark Of the-

(sees Olivers forehead)
Oh no he hasnt

( )

OLIVER
Its called laser surgery Gary
Its a small price to pay for not
being called fucking O-Man Oh and
I hear it works for Sisters Of
Mercy tattoos too

GARY
I still like Sisters Of Mercy

OLIVER
Well youd have to wouldnt you
Otherwise youd never go swimming

again

GARY
Im lost

OLIVER

PETER

Well I for one think it’s nice to
see the old faces

VOICE (0OS)
Excuse me

A BURLY MAN (40s) approaches Peter and gestures to a chair

BURLY MAN
Is this chair taken

Peters mouth hangs open He doesnt reply

GARY
Have it mate

BURLY MAN
Fanks

The burly man leaves with the chair Peter watches him go

OLIVER
Wasnt that-

PETER
Shane Hawkins

STEVEN
Wait didnt he-

( )

PETER
Yes he did

GARY
What happened with Shane Hawkins
again

PETER
Id rather not dredge it all up
again if thats okay

GARY
Come on man you can tell us
Bottling up past trauma can lead to
inadequate coping strategies in
later life apparently

PETER

I don’t know it’s not even about
the past It’s not about the fact
that he bullied me that he made me
miss more school days than chicken
pox Its not that he forced me to
spend entire lessons hiding ina
toilet cubicle or that he punched
me so hard he dislodged my eyeball
It’s not even that he ruined a
large portion of my childhood

Gary’s attention drifts to a table of teens downing shots
PETER
It’s the fact that just then he
looked straight through me like it
all meant nothing Probably sounds
weird doesn’t it

GARY (0S)
SHOTS

Gary returns with five full shot glasses

GARY
S-H-O-T-S Shots

ANDY
What are you doing Gary

GARY
I thought it was obvious Shots

( )

ANDY
Firstly Peter was talking about
something that clearly made him
uncomfortable

PETER
It’s alright Andy

ANDY
It’s not alright Peter Secondly
12 pints is more than enough and
thirdly I DON’T FUCKING DRINK

GARY
Yeah but shots don’t count-

ANDY
Gary you said you wanted to catch
up and chew the fat I think you
just want to drink it You don’t
want us here as your friends We’re
just your fucking enablers

GARY
Enablers Thats a funny word
‘Gary King And The Enablers
Thats a good name for the new
band Steve Write that down

STEVEN

GARY

OLIVER
Its always been a thing

ANDY
You dont need us to get fucked up

ANDY

GARY

( )

OLIVER

OLIVER
Every year is the anniversary of a
year

GARY
Exactly and this is only the
fourth pub

ANDY
What if its the twelfth Whats

Gary checks the time on his phone Puts it on the table

GARY
The buses are finished

ANDY

PETER

OLIVER
I should go and find Sam

STEVEN

BandB Work this shit off

ANDY
That’s settled then

GARY
You know what I think you’re
jealous You got your houses and
cars and your wives and your kids
and your job security But you
don’t have what I have Freedom
You’re all slaves and I’m free to
do what I want Any old time

( )

ANDY

And this is what you want You
wanna grow up mate Join society

Gary tries to articulate himself But can only manage-

GARY
It’s it’s just Mum died

ANDY
I know and we’re all sorry but now
it’s time to go home

GARY
I thought we were home

Gary robbed of all vitality stands and walks to the toilet

PETER
I can’t help feeling sorry for him

BRRRRR BRRRRR Gary’s mobile vibrates on the table

ANDY
Don’t

We see the caller ID on Gary’s phone It reads “MUM”

INT PUB TOILETS - CONTINUOUS

Gary walks towards the urinal slipping in some piss Ina
rage he goes to punch the wall but stops noticing an
existing crack in the tiles He traces his finger along it
The door opens One of the FIVE TEENS joins at the urinal

GARY
Careful the floors all pissy
Wasnt me

No reply Gary points at the crack in the tiles

GARY
That was me Did that back in 90
1990 Punched the shit out the
wall Cant remember why Seemed
important at the time

No reply
GARY

You look like youre having a good
night though

( )

The TEEN looks at him impassively
GARY
Im doing the Golden Mile You guys
want to tag along Well be like
the Six Musketeers

The Teen doesnt answer He walks to the wash basin

GARY
I said Im doing The Golden Mile

The Teen still doesnt answer He just washes his hands
GARY
You think youre so cool dont you
But you know what We were cooler
We owned this town We paved the
way for you lot Blazed a trail-

The Teen ignores Gary and walks to the hand dryer

GARY
Look at me when Im talking to you

Gary shoves The Teen on the shoulder The Teen turns and
stares at Gary with unnerving calm his face blank

TEEN
Please don’t

GARY
Don’t what

Gary childishly shoves the Teen again

TEEN
You dont want to do that

GARY
Oh dont I

Gary goes to shove a third time The Teen swats the hand away
and in one fluid moment hits the button on the hand dryer
and GRABS GARY BY THE FACE

The ROAR of the air masks the noise of the struggle

A shocked Gary twists free more in panic than with poise and
pushes the Teen against the wall

The Teen recovers with alarming speed grabs Gary and hurls
him across the toilets with surprising strength

( )

Gary smashes a mirror with his face In the cracked
reflection Gary sees the teen striding towards him Gary
flings himself at the Teen in a graceless rugby tackle The
pair stagger backwards slipping in the piss and fall against
the back wall The teen hits the tiles and-

HIS HEAD COMES CLEAN OFF

The DECAPITATED HEAD bounces across the floor spinning to a
stop eyes staring at Gary The dryer stops There is no
blood only an oily BLUE FLUID leaking from the neck

Gary shocked beyond reason clutches the headless body like a
lover The severed head stares back It BLINKS Then-

ANDY (0S)
YOU NEED TO EXPLAIN THIS NOW

A furious Andy bursts in brandishing Garys phone

GARY
But he

Andy is so focused on Gary he fails to see the whole scene

ANDY
Dont change the subject

GARY
I cant

Steven Peter and Oliver burst in to break up the fight They
see the HEADLESS BODY immediately and are dumbfounded

ANDY
You know who I just spoke to Your
mum And not from the afterlife
From fucking Bournemouth

STEVEN
Andy-

ANDY
She says she hasnt spoken to you
for eight months

GARY
But his head-

ANDY

No Gary you cant wriggle out of
this one-

( )

The headless body JERKS INTO LIFE Gary screams like a girl
jumps up and throws the body down He kicks the decapitated
head back into the corner Then-

The HEADLESS TEEN SLOWLY STANDS UP and faces the group more
blue fluid leaking out all over the floor

OLIVER
WTF

The door behind opens The FOUR OTHER TEENAGE BOYS come in
Gary and the gang look at the BLANK FACES of the boys Then-
TEEN 2 hits the hand dryer Again the roar signals-

ATTACK TEEN 3 pounces on Steve trying to GRAB HIS FACE
Peter is knocked back into a urinal in the m ™l ©e

TEENS 2 4 and 5 ATTACK Andy Gary and Oliver trying to grab
their faces They are relentless with dead eyed expressions

The HEADLESS TEEN 1 also grabs Andy from behind

As Steve and Andy struggle Oliver is knocked back against
the wall He flails against the DEATH GRIP of his attacker
with such force that he ends up climbing the wall trying to
get purchase against the ROBOTIC TEEN 2

Gary meanwhile RIPS THE ARM OFF the teen attacking him (TEEN
4) It pops out of its socket like an action figure The
DISMEMBERED LIMB continues to flail still alive

Steve knocks his combatant (TEEN 3) into a urinal breaking
it and the teens pelvis The urinal collapses knocking
Peter over Blue fluid mixes with the urine on the floor
Steven skids around tussling with his opponent

Andy keeps his opponents at bay His anger builds until he
breaks out some wrestling moves against the automatons He
kicks TEEN 5 into a sink and breaks it into two broken
pieces then smashes the HEADLESS TEEN 1 back into the wall
behind before BREAKING ITS BACK over his knee He throws the
now broken teen through the doors of the toilet cubicle

Oliver has now flipped over his attacker and brought him to
the floor Andy drops an elbow on the TEEN 2 SMASHING HIS
HEAD INTO PIECES It is hollow breaking like a bauble

Gary fights the ARMLESS TEEN 4 Beating it with its own
missing limb He knocks the teen to the floor stamps on its
chest and breaks off the second arm He then wails on its
head with the severed limbs The HEAD BREAKS INTO PIECES

( )

Soon the floor of the bathroom is LITTERED WITH SEVERED
LIMBS smashed heads and blue fluid leaking everywhere

The dryer turns off The five men hyperventilate ina
symphony of wheezing They speak in hoarse staccato whispers

OLIVER
WTF Gary WTF

GARY
What the fuck does WTF mean

PETER
This can’t be happening Can it

STEVEN
You said it mate

ANDY
I can’t believe it I can’t
believe you lied about your mum

GARY
It was a white lie

ANDY
How is that a white lie

GARY
Because she’s not dead is she

Andy flails at Gary in an exhausted assault Steven and
Oliver break it up and all four collapse in a heap Peter
runs to the bathroom door Before he can open it-

GARY
Wait Pete where are you going

PETER
To get help

GARY
Don’t do that

PETER
Don’t get help

Gary stands and paces Looks at the DISMEMBERED TEENS
GARY

( )

On this everyone immediately produces their phones

GARY
Hang on who are you calling

PETER

GARY

Oliver holds up his phone we hear a WELL SPOKEN VOICE
THE VOICE

Gary looks at the bodies on the floor

GARY
Holy shit This is all connected

Gary whirls around energised

GARY

PETER

OLIVER

This is Newton Haven

EXTINT PUB TOILETSLOUNGE BAR - MOMENTS LATER

The toilet door creaks open and Gary peeks into the bar We
see the publican a few customers Everything seems fine

STEVEN
Hows it looking

GARY
Normal I dont ltke it

OLIVER
What do we do

GARY
We finish our drinks

( )

Gary hangs the OUT OF ORDER sign on the door He then leads
his shell-shocked companions back to their table

They converse conspiratorially covering their mouths
GARY
Okay let’s neck these and get the
fuck out of here

STEVEN
To London

GARY
To The Trusty Servant

OLIVER
Are you fucking kidding

Gary whips out his TOURIST MAP
GARY

Oh yeah The Good Companions is

PETER

pub

STEVEN

We should get in The Beast and
drive back to London

GARY
My brake light’s broken

STEVEN
So don’t use the brakes

GARY
I’m way over the limit

OLIVER
When has that ever stopped you

GARY
I don’t want to put any more points
on Pete’s license

STEVEN

All eyes go to Andy just as he polishes off THE LAST OF THE
FIVE SHOTS He smacks his lips with grim resignation

( )

ANDY

GARY
Thats settled then The last thing
we need is to get pulled over A)

be in on it and C) weve got blood
on our hands

Gary holds up his blue stained palms

PETER

GARY
Whuh

MOTORCYCLE COP

MOTORCYCLE COP

PETER

The Motorcycle Cop looks suspiciously at Peter

GARY
Thanks

The Motorcycle Cop walks over to the bar and talks to the
publican The gang is freaked out but Gary remains stoic

GARY
The way I see it we told everyone
we were doing The Golden Mile
tonight

(MORE)

( )

GARY (CONTD)
If we suddenly get in the Beast and
head for the hills they’ll know we
know but tf we keep doing what
we’re doing and going where we’re
going they won’t know

PETER
Know what

GARY
That we know I say we do what we
came here to do and quietly slip
away in the morning

OLIVER
Wait Youre really suggesting-

ANDY (0S)
We finish The Golden Mile

All look to Andy again He gulps the dregs of Peters pint
ANDY
Its pointless arguing with him
Lets boo-boo

EXT STREETS OF NEWTON HAVEN - DUSK

A blood-red sunset hangs over Newton Haven as the five lads
walk down the street to Alabama Song by The Doors

GARY
Were five friends On a night out
Having a great time
The friends march onward with painted smiles The same

VARIOUS PASSERSBY from earlier look at the gang failing in
their attempt to appear inconspicuous

INT THE GOOD COMPANIONS - MOMENTS LATER

The gang approach the bar Gary holds up five fingers We see
them simultaneously down their five pints

As they drink they look at the blank faced patrons They
look normal They look harmless They look deeply sinister

GARY

PETER
I feel a little uncomfortable
drinking this much

GARY
It’s Dutch courage isn’t it Like
when English soldiers used to drink
Dutch gin before battle to give
them super strength

OLIVER
I thought it was to dull the sense
of impending doom

GARY

Exactly Five friends On a night
out Having a good time

INT THE TRUSTY SERVANT - MOMENTS LATER

The gang are in pub number six downing pints They finish at
different times with varying degrees of difficulty

OLIVER
I need the toilet

GARY
Go on You’ve earned it

OLIVER
What

( )

GARY
You’re doing a great job

Oliver stumbles to the toilet Gary smiles proudly

GARY
He didn’t make it this far last
time I’m proud of him

ANDY
You’re enjoying this aren’t you

GARY
Yeah like I said five friends on
a night out Having a good time

ANDY
Pretending to have a good time

GARY

ANDY

STEVEN

PETER
Yeah our families could be in
danger for all we know

GARY
I know my mum could be dead For

Andys glass shatters in his hand

GARY
Look why dont I just ask someone
whats going on

STEVEN
Who

Gary points to a familiar face the SHIFTY LOOKING DEALER
from the prologue Older better dressed his hair greying

GARY
The Reverend Green

Gary starts to walk over Andy stops him

( )

ANDY
What the fuck are you doing

GARY
I am going to have a little chat
with the Reverend Green

ANDY
Youre going to buy drugs

GARY
I am going to subtly check whether
or not that is The Reverend and if
it is we can find out whats going
on and possibly buy some drugs

STEVEN
But what if hes one of them

GARY
Me and The Reverend had a highly
sophisticated code when discussing
the purchase of narcotics If he
doesnt understand it means hes
one of them and I will walk away

Gary sidles up next to The Reverend Green and performs an
elaborate sequence of knocks on the bar

GARY
Have you got any drugs

THE REVEREND
I dont do that anymore Gary

GARY
Do what

THE REVEREND
That

GARY
That why youre in a suit Drug
dealing not good enough for you

THE REVEREND
There are no dealers anymore I
have a proper job in a proper
office

GARY
You had a proper office before

( )

THE REVEREND
That was the mens toilet

GARY
Nothing wrong with doing your
business in the toilet

THE REVEREND
Things have changed since you left

GARY
I know

THE REVEREND
How much do you know

GARY
A little

THE REVEREND
How much is a little

GARY
The town has been taken over by
robots full of blue stuff

The Reverend looks around in a panic and hushes Gary

THE REVEREND
Keep your voice down you have no
idea what you’re talking about

GARY
Tell us then

THE REVEREND
They’re not robots Do you even
know what robot means

GARY
Yeah course like
(robot voice)
Hello I ama robot

THE REVEREND
It means slave and believe me
they are not slaves

GARY
Are you being held prisoner

THE REVEREND
No I am very happy

( )

GARY
Tell your face

Andy and Steven join in to whisper conspiratorially

ANDY
Whats going on

GARY
Theres been an invasion by robots
who arent robots and The Revs
their prisoner

THE REVEREND
I am not

STEVEN
Were leaving first thing We can
get you out of here

THE REVEREND
Im not going This is not what you
think This is all for our benefit

The person next to them at the bar turns and whispers

COLLABORATOR 1
You’ve said too much Trevor

A second person turns and whispers harshly

COLLABORATOR 2
Yeah put a cork in it Trevor

THE REVEREND
I’m trying to help

COLLABORATOR 2
It’s not your place to help

COLLABORATOR 1
They will have everything in hand

GARY
Are you guys robots

COLLABORATOR 1
Well the term robot actually comes
from an old Czech word-

COLLABORATOR 2
Robotnik

( )

COLLABORATOR 1
-meaning slave-

COLLABORATOR 2
-and we are not slaves

COLLABORATOR 1
We are very very happy

COLLABORATOR 2
And not ‘robots

Peter joins the bar

PETER
Oh my god are these guys robots

THE REVEREND
Can we shut up about robots

COLLABORATOR 1
I say we shut up about everything

A GREEN ROTARY PHONE RINGS behind the bar The Publican picks
up listens without speaking and hands it to The Reverend

PUBLICAN 6
Trevor it’s your supervisor

The Reverend’s shoulders sag He takes the call We briefly
hear a WELL SPOKEN VOICE on the other end of the line

VOICE (0OS)
Hello Trevor

REVEREND
Yes sir but I understand

The Reverend hands the receiver back to the Publican and
throws a forlorn look at Gary and company

REVEREND
Thanks a bunch

The Reverend dejectedly walks off and disappears into the
men’s toilet just as a refreshed Oliver emerges

OLIVER
What did I miss

COLLABORATOR 1
Your friends trying to “help”

( )

COLLABORATOR 2
We don’t need “help”

ANDY
Well what should we do

COLLABORATOR 1
I suggest you get on your way

GARY
I think we should do what they say

COLLABORATOR 2
I think you should do what we say

GARY
I said that

OLIVER
Okay

EXT STREETS OF NEWTON HAVEN - EVENING

The gang move through the dark streets A gleeful Gary
striding at the front the others stumbling behind

GARY
Come on

STEVEN
Lets get in and out of here yeah
No more making new friends

INT THE TWO HEADED DOG - EVENING

PUBLICAN 7
Ah gentlemen The prodigal sons
return What will it be one of our
guest ales perchance

GARY
Uhhhh

PUBLICAN 7
Might I recommend five pints of
Crowning Glory Rather fitting
wouldnt you say Gary

GARY
What

( )

The gang stare back at the Publican bemused

PUBLICAN 7
Its a delightful brew hoppy
nutty foamy

ANDY
Does it have a surprisingly fruity
note that lingers on the tongue

PUBLICAN 7
Ah youre obviously a connoisseur

Andy barks a laugh If he were sober it wouldnt be funny
PUBLICAN 7
Then you’1l already know that it’s
a rare treat for rogues reverends
royalty and all good folks between

OLIVER
Mmmmm five of those please

PUBLICAN 7
Welcome home boys

AT THEIR TABLE the drunk confused gang stare at Publican 7

GARY
Don’t remember him being that
friendly

STEVEN

He’s obviously one of them

GARY
How can he be He remembered me

ANDY
We don’t know what they remember

OLIVER
Maybe they have selective memories

GARY
Yeah like me

ANDY

Maybe he’s one of the others Like
The Reverend

( )

OLIVER
It really is hard to tell isn’t
it

GARY

Is he one of them or one of them

PETER
Wait which ones are the thems

GARY
They’re both thems But there’s two
different ways of saying it Is he
one of them or one of them

ANDY
We need different terms One for
the people who aren’t robots and
one for the robots who aren’t
robots

STEVEN
Alright we need to be able to
differentiate between them them
and us

PETER
Yeah I think the pronouns are
really confusing

GARY
I agree I dont even know what a
pronoun is

OLIVER
Its a word that can function by
itself as a noun that refers to
something else in the discourse

GARY
I dont get it

ANDY
You just used one

GARY
Did I

ANDY

Yeah It is a pronoun

GARY
What is

( )

ANDY
It

GARY
Is it

Andy takes a giant swig of his drink
STEVEN
Look we just need a word to
identify whos who Hes a blank

definitely blanks
As Steven says this Sam walks in with THE TWINS

GARYSTEVE
Sam

The sight of Sam brings Steven to his feet but just as he is
about to approach her Gary pushes him back down

GARY

Gary leaves the table and sidles up to Sam at the bar

GARY
Alright Sam

SAM
Oh Jesus

Gary suddenly bundles Sam off towards the disabled toilets

INT THE DISABLED TOILET - CONTINUOUS
Gary slams the door behind them Sam is incredulous

SAM
Fucks sake Gary take a hint

GARY

SAM
Why are we in the disabled toilets

GARY

I need to tell you something right

now unless you do actually want to
have sex in which case I can tell

you afterwards

SAM
Tell me right now

GARY
Did you notice anything creepy
about The Twins apart from the fact
that they’re twins

SAM
Just because they’re twins doesn’t
automatically make them creepy

GARY
Does a little bit

SAM
You had sex with them

GARY
No I didn’t How did you know that

( )

SAM
It’s a small town Gary and I’m not
stupid and well they told me

GARY
Okay I did once but I was wasted
which did make it creepy because
it was like there was four of them
I am not proud I ama bit

SAM
This is what you wanted to tell me

GARY
No this is
INT THE TWO HEADED DOG - MOMENTS LATER
We hear a SMACK Sam emerges from the toilet without Gary

THE TWINS
Are you okay Sam

SAM
I need a cigarette

Sam walks out to the beer garden The Twins follow
BACK AT THE TABLE The gang is deep in conversation

PETER
Nobots

ANDY
How about Fauxbots

OLIVER

whole robots thing

PETER
Steven

Steven sees a furtive Gary emerge from the ladies

STEVEN

ANDY

Dont worry hes probably just
trying to fuck Olivers sister

( )

OLIVER
(chuckles )
Oh Andy

EXT THE BEER GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER
Sam and The Twins sit at a picnic table Sam sparks up

SAM
My god that man is full of shit I
know thats not a surprise to you

THE TWINS
What did he say

SAM
He said Newton Haven has been taken
over by robots full of blue stuff
and if we dont do what they say
they will make us their prisoners

THE TWINS
Did you believe him

SAM
Of course not

THE TWINS
Did you believe him

The Twins stare Sams smile fades They look creepy
BAM Gary knocks The Twins over with a flying tackle

SAM
Oh crumbs

One twin falls flat on her back the other goes with Gary
into a nearby hedge Sam sees him tussle with the flailing
Twin He pushes her head down and POPS IT OFF Sam yelps

GARY
See

Sam stands in shock as Gary holds the head aloft Then the
DECAPITATED HEAD in his hand intones calmly

DECAPITATED TWIN HEAD

Come on Sam you know better than
to believe Gary King

( )

Gary SMASHES THE HEAD on the ground into a million pieces
Before Sam can react the other Twin grabs her hair and
SMACKS HER HEAD on the picnic table She then YANKS HER HAIR
BACK flipping Sam hard onto the grass

The Twin then runs toward Gary and POUNCES ON HIM Gary
wrestles with the Twins one with a head attacking one
headless and convulsing

GARY
Get off me you creepy bitches

Gary extricates himself from the m ™l ©e and shoulder charges
one Twin into the other sending them both crashing through
the hedge through a fence and down an embankment

Gary walks over to Sam and seemingly extends a hand to her

GARY
Chuck us a ciggie

Dazed Sam hands Gary a cigarette

SAM
Gary whats happening

GARY
I told you in the disableds

SAM
Yes you did

He hauls her up They are covered in grass stains and twigs
GARY
We should get inside people will

wonder what the hell’s going on

STEVEN (0S)
What the hell’s going on

GARY
I got this Steve

SAM
Got what

They both turn to see an emotional STEVEN Gary and Sam look
at each other unsure where to start

STEVEN
Sam hes not good enough for you

( )

GARY and SAM
What

STEVEN
Weve been through some crazy shit
tonight and its really put things
in perspective for me and if its
all as fucked up as it seems then
theres something I need to tell
you and you might think this is
because Ive drunk seven pints of
lager but its not Im in love
with you Sam I always have been
and it breaks my heart to see you
waste your affections on Gary King

GARY
Thats a bit harsh

SAM
Oh no youve got it all wrong

STEVEN
And since Im being honest just to
lay it out I am currently seeing a
fitness instructor but I - shes 26-
years-old - but I would drop her in
a heartbeat if I thought I had one
last chance with you

SAM
Theres nothing between me and
Gary

WHAM Gary and Sam are thrust apart by THE TWINBOT An
amalgam of the twins in one single body It possesses two
legs instead of two arms and looks very creepy indeed

Steven backs up shocked and falls over The TWINBOT bears
down reaching out with its new legs to strike when-

Gary reappears and LEAPS onto the creature a split second
later Sam joins him PUMMELLING it with a picnic umbrella

STEVEN
Get your feet off her

Steven regains his composure and joins the mélée using a
picnic bench to LAUNCH himself onto the Twins Their combined
efforts topple the opponent to the ground

The three humans tussle with a chaos of flailing limbs

( )

GARY
Pop its head off Like an aspirin
bottle

Steven emits an orgasmic yelp as he twists something out of
sight we hear two pops then A LOUD CRACK

INT THE TWO HEADED DOG - MOMENTS LATER

PETER
Blue-bloods

ANDY
Nothing suggested in the last three
minutes is better than ‘Smashy-
Smashy Egg Men’ Nothing
Gary Sam and Steve re-enter all sweaty and grass stained

OLIVER
What the hell’s going on

GARY
Did you guys think of a name for
the robots who aren’t robots

PETER
I’m afraid we’ve drawn a ‘blank’

GARY
Well we just had a barney with two
‘blanks’ in the beer garden

SAM
We have to leave now

GARY
Agreed Let’s hit The Mermaid

Gary heads off Oliver and Peter follow without question

SAM
Wait What

Andy speaks up He is now very very drunk

( )

ANDY
Gary thinks we should keep on with
the crawl because they know what
were doing but they dont know
that we know what theyre doing
And basically no one has a better
idea so fuck it

Andy crashes through the door leaving Steven and Sam behind

SAM
What Wait

EXT STREETS OF NEWTON HAVEN - NIGHT

Gary forges ahead like a drunken Gandalf the others
stumbling behind in his wake Sam shouts after them

SAM

Gary says theyll get us if we try
and leave now

OLIVER

seemed like the right moment
Something always got in the way

OLIVER (0S)

Oliver appears behind Sam laden with drinks Sam knocks into
him causing a spill At this precise moment-—

Steven is dragged through a doorway out of sight by an
unseen pair of hands Sam turns back Steven is gone

SAM

evil far from it People got a lot
friendlier That’s how they do it

INT THE MERMAID - CONTINUOUS

Gary Andy and Peter drunk with lust as the girls work them
like puppets Sam shakes her head but Oliver smiles

BASIL (0S)

Andy does his best to resist Beckys kisses He shows her his
wedding ring she sucks it off his finger and swallows it

BASIL (0S)

At an empty table surrounded by six vacant seats sits their
favourite teacher MR SHEPHERD older but still cool
looking He awaits them with five beers and a vodka tonic

GARY PETERSTEVEN

SAM

Peter sniggers Gary giggles but regains composure

GARY

GARY

MR SHEPHERD

Gary is pleased with himself

PETER
So are you a robot sir

MR SHEPHERD

No Peter I’m not a robot

Steven puts his hand up

MR SHEPHERD
Yes Steven

( )

STEVEN
You’re on their side though

MR SHEPHERD
This isn’t about sides Steven
It’s not shirts versus skins It’s
about working together as one team

The gang listen intently but are too drunk to take it in
They shuffle and mutter comments as if they are in class

MR SHEPHERD
I know it seems weird and a bit
scary but believe me its quite
the opposite Theyre here to help
kids To straighten us out and
prepare us for the big league
Theyve seen something in us a
potential like the promise I saw
in you Theres a vast community of
worlds up there living peacefully
cooperatively together A network
of unity and consistency and guess
what They want us along for the
ride Pretty cool eh gang

The gang struggle to concentrate Peter is now asleep

OLIVER
So theyre not here to harm us

MR SHEPHERD
Far from it O-Man theyre here to

straighten you all out in my time

GARY

STEVEN

( )

OLIVER
Well it seems pretty clear to me

BANG Andy has smashed Olivers head right off with a bar
stool It flips back attached by a bio-mechanical tendon

SAM
Andy What the fuck

Olivers head flips back up Face missing Only his mouth
remains It speaks

OLIVER
Yes Andy What the fuck

GARY
WTF

Sam yells and kicks Olivers stool over knocking him down

Mr Shepherd leaps up and smashes a FIRE ALARM AS IT RINGS
HIS MOUTH BECOMES A CONDUIT FOR A BLINDING WHITE LIGHT

All other patrons turn to the gang THEIR EYES AND MOUTHS
ALIGHT They talk as one in a WELL SPOKEN VOICE

MR SHEPHERD and PATRONS
HUMANS YOU LEAVE US NO RECOURSE
IF YOU WILL NOT JOIN US WILLINGLY
WE WILL BE FORCED TO USE OTHER
MEANS OF PERSUASION NOW PLEASE -

Andy grabs Mr Shepherds tie pulls him into a VICIOUS
HEADBUTT that completely smashes his head into pieces

ANDY
Fuck you Guy

Andy rips his shirt off picks up two bar stools as blunt
weapons and roars at the blanks like the FUCKING HULK

ANDY
You want some Ill smash your
fucking heads in I fucking hate
this town

ALL THE BLANKS ATTACK The brawl is fast brutal and insane

Gary swipes at the blanks with his stool taking swigs of
beer between each blow still trying to down his pint

( )

Steve and Sam fight side by side SMASHING BLANKS with their
chairs Wood splinters heads and limbs break

Andy has turned into a rugby-boy brawler again as he cuts a
swathe through the blanks Peter watches him in awe He tries
to ape him but is immediately KNOCKED DOWN and surrounded

Andy smashes Peters attacker out of the way and wrestles
with him Gary shouts from the touchline

GARY
Twist the melon man

Andy does so The blanks head POPS CLEAN OFF He uses the
DETACHED HEAD to smash another blank in the face

Meanwhile Sam is suddenly attacked by her PARTIALLY HEADLESS
BROTHER Steven sees this and GRABS OLIVERS ARM

OLIVERS ARM POPS OUT OF ITS SOCKET Oliver then punches
Steve with his remaining limb and sends him reeling through a
table and onto the ground with a crash

Oliver turns back to Sam and flatly intones

OLIVER
Sam this is no way for a family to
behave

Sam is roughly pushed aside Gary with drink in hand
attacks Oliver swinging his stool into a devastating
uppercut He takes another swig as Oliver crashes down

Andy meanwhile RIPS ARMS and STOMPS ON FALLEN BLANKS He is
such a whirlwind of anger that he splits the room leaving
Gary and Sam fighting blanks with stools on one side Steven
and Peter are trapped on the other

The pub doors swing open And MR SHEPHERD walks in

MR SHEPHERD
Okay Break it up

Mr Shepherd is miraculously intact again and walks back to
his table

MR SHEPHERD
It doesnt have to be like this If
only youd see the light

Andy and the others turn to see a smiling Oliver standing up
and reattaching his own arm Masses of blanks flank him

( )

OLIVER
Its not about conflict Its about
togetherness

Mr Shepherd sits down at the same table (next to the
previous Shepherds decapitated body) He puts his feet up
and breaks out in a wide smile
MR SHEPHERD
Yes What say we try this again
How about another round

Gary finishes his drink and smashes the glass to the ground

GARY
Nah we’re done here

MR SHEPHERD
Yes Gary that would appear to be
the case

The blanks swarm separating the gang from each other

ANDY
Let’s go Meet at the smokehouse

GARY
The smokehouse

ANDY
Just do it

Andy lifts a bench and THROWS IT THROUGH THE WINDOW
Steven sees Gary grab Sam’s hand and pull her away She
throws Steven a helpless look as they disappear upstairs
INT THE BEEHIVE RESIDENTIAL QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

The fire alarm still rings as Gary and Sam race upstairs and
burst into a living room where an ELDERLY COUPLE sit

The couple advance THEIR EYES AND MOUTH ILLUMINATED

ELDERLY COUPLE
HUMANS YOU LEAVE US NO RECOURSE

Gary grabs the OLD LADY BLANK flips her upside down and uses
her as a battering ram to SMASH THE WINDOW He then throws
the old lady’s body back at her husband
EXT THE BEEHIVE ROOF - NIGHT

They get on the roof The fire alarm appears to be ringing

throughout the entire town Gary is out of ideas

GARY
Come on

SAM

Ooh look theres my car Lets

climb down the drainpipe

GARY
Ive got a better idea

Gary jumps and lands on the roof of Sams car
denting it and blowing out the windscreen

GARY
Climb down the drainpipe

severely

A minute later Sam gets into the car Gary shuts her door

GARY

Okay go
SAM

Wait What about everybody else
GARY

Leave em with me I got this
SAM

Are you sure
GARY

I always come up smiling
SAM

I dont know if thats true
GARY

Just go
SAM

Will you find out what happened to

my brother

GARY

Of course and Ill look after

Stevie for you eh

off Sams bashful acknowledgement

( )

GARY
Hes a good guy better than me

SAM
Gary you’re not a bad person
youre just not boyfriend material
The whole ‘free spirit quick one
in the disabled toilets’ thing is
kinda cool when you’re seventeen
but not so much when you’re facing
forty There comes a time when you
have to go forwards and not
backwards

GARY
Maybe if I hadn’t left you behind
that night it would have been
different

SAM
Its not all about that night
yknow

GARY
Isnt it

SAM
It doesnt have to be

GARY
Well always have the disableds
though eh

SAM
Yes well always have the
disableds

Sam smiles and fondly kisses him on the cheek

She drives off her damaged car RATTLING LOUDLY Gary gets
up his knees cracking He groans feeling his age

This attracts the attention of a BLANK who appears at the
mouth of the alley its eyes ILLUMINATING INTO SEARCHLIGHTS

Gary disappears out of shot We hear a jump and a crash The
blank turns its searchlights to see that Gary has failed to
vault a fence He gets embarrassed and disappears again

Gary hightails it to a local park past a sign saying KEEP
OFF THE GRASS and towards the deserted bowling clubhouse

INT THE BOWLS CLUB - CONTINUOUS

Gary bursts in Andy Peter and Steven spin around

STEVEN
Wheres Sam
GARY
I put her in her car
STEVENPETER
You did what
GARY
Put her in a car told her to
leave
ANDY

You just sent away the only one of
us sober enough to drive

GARY
Yeah

STEVEN
You just couldn’t stand the fact
that she might prefer me to you

GARY
That’s not true

STEVEN
It is true Gary I was getting
somewhere We held hands

GARY
Oh c’mon I was trying to help

STEVEN
Trying to help yourself more like

GARY
Jesus I do something right for a
change and you all get on my case

ANDY
Wow that’s the first time I’ve
ever heard you admit being wrong

GARY
I said I did something right

( )

STEVEN
Yeah ‘for a change’
GARY
So
ANDY
Meaning the rest of the time you’re
wrong
GARY

Not necessarily

ANDY and STEVEN
Arrrgghhhhh

GARY
I just thought it would be best to
get her out of harms way

PETER
And what about us Gary Arent we

GARY
Were alright Pete Were The Five
Musketeers

PETER
Four Musketeers

STEVEN
Wait how do we know you put her in

ANDY

GARY

Gary King How do I know youre

ANDY
Weve been together the whole time

GARY

You might all not be you How did
you know that O-Man wasnt O-Man

( )

ANDY
His birthmark was back

GARY
What does that prove

STEVEN
Because of what Basil said They
make a copy from your DNA Thats
why he had his birthmark He was
new like a baby

ANDY
Like a man-baby

PETER
A maybe

STEVEN
Oliver with none of the shit that
had happened to the real Oliver

ANDY
The laser surgery

GARY
So the blanks really are blank

ANDY
No wear and tear no scars

GARY
Steven in 1987 we were playing
cricket and I accidentally pushed
you onto a broken bottle that
nearly went up your bum

STEVEN
So

GARY
So show us your arse

Steven drops his trousers and bends over He shows off an
area of scar tissue just beneath his right buttock

GARY
Very nice Peter when you got that
50CC Suzuki in 1988 you let me
have a go and I ran over your leg

Peter gingerly pulls up the leg of his trousers revealing a
perfectly intact limb The others gasp in horror

( )

PETER
Oh wait its my other one

Peter pulls up the other leg to reveal knotted scar tissue

GARY
Andy in 1986 we re-enacted the
Knife Game out of Aliens and I
stabbed you in the middle finger

ANDY
Or how about December 1997 when
you ODd and I drove you to
hospital four times over the limit
and ended up rolling the car and
almost severing my femoral artery
at which point you made a
miraculous recovery and ran off
into the night leaving me to get
arrested after the twelve hours of
life saving surgery

GARY
Either one of those will do

Andy gives Gary the finger revealing a distinct scar

GARY
Thank you

STEVEN
What about you

Gary proudly reveals his ‘Sisters of Mercy’ tattoo

STEVEN
That could be drawn on

PETER
Aren’t all tattoos drawn on
GARY
Yeah
ANDY
Show us your arm
GARY
What
ANDY

Show us your arm

( )

GARY
No

ANDY
You came off your skateboard in
fifth year and dislocated your
elbow You’ve got a scar where they
put that metal plate in

GARY
I don’t have to show you nothing I
know I’m me If I’m not me how
would I know that carved into that
beam above your head are the words
‘KING GARY’

ANDY
It doesn’t say “KING GARY”

GARY
Yes it does Doesn’t it

ANDY
It says “KING GAY”
GARY
Some cunt scrubbed out the R
STEVEN
That was me
GARY
Why
PETER
(laughs )
King Gay
ANDY

That means fuck all anyway Mr
Shepherd remembered stuff so did
Olly Selective memory remember
We havent seen you for years and
you brought us here You better
come up with some hard evidence
that youre human or were going to
find out for ourselves

GARY
Oh you want proof

Gary head-butts a support beam holding up the roof BANG

( )

GARY
There That proves Im human

He does it again several times BANG BANG BANG

STEVEN
It proves youre stupid

GARY
Exactly Ow

ANDY PETER and STEVEN
Its Gary

FOOTSTEPS OUTSIDE They look through a window to see a BLANK
PATROL all using their BRIGHT EYES as searchlights

ANDY
Whole towns out looking for us

GARY
Thats a good thing If everyones
outside that means nobodys
inside Come on
Gary runs out heroically leaving the others confused

ANDY
Wait Gary fuck

EXT THE PARK - NIGHT

Gary sprints through a shadowy avenue of trees The others
stumble along behind

ANDY
Gary Gary What do you mean
nobodys inside

GARY
I mean we can still do this

STEVEN
Still do what

ANDY
Were still on the crawl

Peter lags behind blind drunk He trips and steadies himself
on a tree He catches his breath then sniggers

( )

PETER
King Gay

A VOICE (0OS)
Peter

SHANE HAWKINS steps out from behind a tree smiling benignly

SHANE HAWKINS
Peter I thought that was you Are
you okay

PETER
What Am I what

SHANE HAWKINS
Look Peter I know we didnt see
eye to eye at school Goodness
knows I regret that I wanted to
say something back at the pub but I
felt so terribly ashamed by what
Id done

Shane holds out a hand to a stunned confused Peter
SHANE HAWKINS
Let me make it up to you Peter
please

Up ahead Andy and Steven catch up with Gary

STEVEN
You’re out of your mind

GARY
We’ve come too far Steve

ANDY
It’s fucking suicide

Gary stops and turns to them with a grin

GARY
I’m going to get to The World’s End
if it kills me where’s Pete

They all look back and see that Peter is sat astride Shane
Hawkins PUMMELLING HIS FACE WITH HIS FISTS

PETER
YOU FUCKING BASTARD I HATE YOU

Horrified the others call out in loud whispers

( )

ANDY
Peter Leave it

Shane Hawkins reasons with Peter as his head is smashed in
SHANE HAWKINS
Why are you doing this Peter We

don’t want to hurt you

STEVEN
Come on mate It’s not worth it

Peter puts a fist through Shane Hawkins head SHOUTS BACK

PETER
Yes it fucking is

Peter runs off and quickly returns with AN ENORMOUS BRANCH

ANDY
Oh shit

Peter bludgeons Shane Hawkins with the branch but hears-
MOTORCYCLE COP (0S)
I must say Im very disappointed
in you Peter

The MOTORCYCLE COP steps from the shadows shakes his head

Peter drops the branch freaked out A MASS OF BLANKS
stepping out from the trees and approaching from all sides

The eyes of the blanks GLOW IN THE DARK Peter looks around
him The blanks close in relentlessly and swallow him up
Andy wants to help but is dragged back by Steven and Gary

ANDY
Ill punch their lights out

STEVEN
Theres too many of them Andy

The GLOWING EYED BLANKS envelop Peter transforming their
limbs into restraints around his arms and neck

The Motorcycle Cop grabs Peters face and his hand begins to
glow Peter convulses the life draining from his face

He is beyond saving Andys fight ebbs away Steven and Gary
pull him into the shadows and out of sight

( )

GARY
We have to go

STEVEN
Garys right

GARY
We have to get to The Kings Head

STEVEN
Exactly What

ANDY

(furious)
We’re not going to The King’s Head
Gary Were done We’re going to do
what we should have done in the
first place get The Beast and get
out of here we’re fucking leaving
and NEVER coming back Now you can
come with us willingly or I will
knock you the fuck out and carry
you there myself Your choice

GARY
Okay Just think about what you’re
saying Because you know you have
been drinking

WHAM Andy knocks Gary the fuck out

EXT STREETS OF NEWTON HAVEN - MOMENTS LATER

Andy runs an unconscious Gary over his shoulder Steven
follows A BLANK PATROL forces them to hide in a car park
The blanks eyes are spotlights sweeping the streets

On the other side we see another patrol step into the light
Its the FIVE TEENS from earlier Now perfectly intact again

ANDY
Not them again

Then from behind them a strange and loud CLANKING OF METAL

STEVEN
What the hell is that

ANDY
Its modern art

( )

They look up to the bizarre sight of THE BRONZE SCULPTURE
towering over them and walking through the town Its whole
head is a large powerful spotlight searching for humans

STEVEN
Were trapped Wheres The Beast

Andy whips out the TOURIST MAP from Garys pocket
ANDY
Uh were here so The Beast is

only in the next street

STEVEN
How the hell do we get to it

ANDY
We’1ll have to go through

STEVEN
Through where

Andy looks up at the nearest building and shakes his head

ANDY
I don’t fucking believe this

Above them swings the sign for The King’s Head

INT THE KING’S HEAD - MOMENTS LATER
Andy and Steve kick the door open It’s deserted

Andy lays Gary unconscious on the bar leaving the map on his
chest Andy and Steven make their way to the back and see-

THE BEAST in the car park of the guest house next door Blank
Patrols run here and there with growing frequency

ANDY
Right we wait for an opening then
leg it to The Beast

STEVEN
We need the keys

Andy and Steve look back to Gary Their jaws drop

Gary is awake again and standing behind the bar pulling
himself a pint Despite a black eye his mood seems calm

( )

ANDY
Gary what are you doing

GARY
Just a little toast

Gary raises a full pint Andy edges forward

ANDY
Gary put the pint down

GARY
To Oliver Peter And you know
what Ten pubs isnt bad

ANDY
Its not but were calling time

GARY
So close

Gary takes out a blue marker and crosses Pub 10 from the map

He then sinks his pint in one He smacks his lips fire in
his eyes He looks at Andy who knows what he’s about to do

ANDY
No

Gary throws Andy his car keys then pockets the map

ANDY
Gary

Gary LEAPS OVER the bar and runs out through the open door

STEVEN
Let him go He left you man

ANDY
I can’t

Andy throws the car keys to Steven and takes off after Gary

STEVEN
ANDY

Andy leaves a shocked Steven who looks out at The Beast

EXT STREETS OF NEWTON HAVEN - CONTINUOUS

Gary runs down the middle of the street towards the next pub
GLOWING EYED blanks give chase A huge spotlight illuminates
Gary the sound of the BRONZE SCULPTURE growing closer

Andy too is on Gary’s tail screaming at him

ANDY
Come back you stupid bastard

Gary barges aside blanks intent on reaching his goal

We see familiar faces from earlier among the blanks The same
VARIOUS PASSERSBY all THE PUBLICANS theyve met

He rips the arm off PUBLICAN 1 and knocks the head off
PUBLICAN 3 with the severed limb

As he nears the eleventh pub he runs over a picnic table
and kicks the MOTORCYCLE COP in the face on the way down

Andy knocks aside attackers with the same ferocity He sees
Gary up ahead ducking into The Hole in the Wall

We follow Andy as he makes his way towards the pub DODGING
AND FIGHTING BLANKS of all apparent ages and sizes

The BRONZE SCULPTURE suddenly stands in Andys path He skids
underneath the legs without breaking his run

Andy then rips the arms from two of THE TEENS and smashes
another two with the same dismembered limbs

INT THE HOLE IN THE WALL - CONTINUOUS

Andy enters The Hole in the Wall at such speed the door
flies off its hinges Gary is already behind the bar raising

a pint to his lips he sees Andy and knows he must act fast

GARY
Andy look out

TWO BLANKS pounce on Andy from behind He barely turns to
swiftly and furiously dispatch them with the severed limbs

Andy makes toward Gary but hears the ROAR OF AN ENGINE

THE BEAST SMASHES THROUGH THE WALL Steven is at the wheel
We see SWARMS OF BLANKS approaching the new hole in the wall

( )

STEVEN
Gary Andy get the fuck in

GARY
You heard him Andy

Gary finishes his pint crosses 11 off his map and runs for a
back window He DIVES THROUGH THE GLASS smashing it

STEVEN
We don’t have much-

BANG TEEN 1 jumps onto the Beast’s roof Like Andy it has
adopted the dismembered limbs as clubs It flips down to the
ground to face Steven as another blank rips the car door off

A jagged shape smashes through the back window The BRONZE
SCULPTURE pulls the Beast back outside with its limbs

ANDY
Steven

The Beast is overwhelmed with blanks The Teen jumps down to
menace Andy as the Bronze Sculpture shatters the windscreen

STEVEN (0S)
Andy Go Now

Andy has no option but to follow Gary through the window

EXT THE STREETS OF NEWION HAVEN - CONTINUOUS
Andy lands and rolls on the tarmac Up ahead he sees
Gary sprinting uphill towards THE WORLD’S END Andy follows

The wind whips against Gary The TOURIST MAP blows out of his
jacket and flies into the air landing in Andy’s face

As he casts it aside Andy sees the Marmalade Sandwich
approaching fast He barges into Tracy Benson knocking her
flying He shoulder charges Erica Leekes then sees -

Becky Salt No glowing eyes Looking absolutely perfect

BECKY SALT
I want you inside me Andy

ANDY
Im sorry

( )

Andy plunges his fist into Beckys stomach His hand emerges
covered in blue stuff wedding ring between finger and thumb

He places it back on his finger and runs off

ANDY
Cheers

INT THE WORLDS END - NIGHT

A single full pint stands alone on a table Behind it the
door bursts open to reveal Gary mad panting He approaches
the drink as though it were the holy grail

An eerie silence in the bar as though the world has been
reduced to just Gary and the pint He raises it to his lips

SMACK Its Andy He slaps the glass from Garys hand

ANDY
Youve had enough

GARY
This is it Andy This is The
Worlds End

ANDY
I know

Furious Gary runs towards the bar Andy tries to stop him
An angry fight ensues

ANDY
Stop This Now

Andy throws Gary through a table to stop him

GARY
Leave me alone What do you care

ANDY
Of course I fucking care Theres a
reason Im angry at you you idiot

GARY
I KNOW why youre angry but its
not MY fault you crashed and its
not even MY fault that I ran off
that was the fucking drugs

( )

ANDY
I dont care about that Its not
the point I got better You
didnt You let me down man Thats
why Im angry You were Gary King
Gary fucking King I believed in
you I would have followed you to
the fucking end Jesus I have

GARY
Then stop following me

Gary pushes Andy away and runs for the bar Andy grabs Garys
trenchcoat and they scrabble on the floor

GARY
Whats it like to be happy Andy

ANDY
What are you talking about

GARY
Youve got everything you want
Your perfect job your perfect
house your perfect wife

ANDY
You think its all perfect She
left me Gary Do you honestly
believe Id be here if I didnt
have an empty house She took the
kids to her mums three weeks ago
Said Im not present enough You
think I gave up No Im trying to
win her back God knows Im
losing but Im gonna keep fighting
Gary because thats how we
survive For fucks sake I just
punched my wedding ring out of a
robots tummy

GARY
Exactly You keep fighting for
what’s important

ANDY
What’s so important about The
Golden Mile

GARY
It’s all I’ve got

( )

Gary scrambles over the bar Andy grabs the belt on the back
of his trench and it rips off Andy tumbles backwards

Gary gets behind the bar and grabs a glass He’s about to
pull himself a pint when Andy grabs him and pulls him away by
the coat

Gary desperately wriggles out of his trench-coat and throws a
punch Andy catches it Gary’s sleeve drops revealing a
bandaged wrist

ANDY
You need help Gary

Andy grabs the other hand revealing not only another bandage
but a hospital ID bracelet Realisation dawns

Gary pushes a shocked Andy onto the ground

GARY
I got help You know what help was
Help was a lot of people sitting
in a circle talking about how bad
things had got That is not my idea
of a good time

ANDY
And this is It can’t all be a good
time things have to be bad
sometimes otherwise you’ll never
know how ‘good’ really feels

GARY
They told me when to go to bed
Andy

ANDY

Gary mate you can’t get drunk
unless you’re sober

GARY
I DON’T WANT TO BE SOBER

Gary stands and takes a second glass from the shelf

GARY
It never got better Andy It never
got better than that night It was
supposed to be the beginning of my
life All that promise and fucking
optimism That feeling that we
could take on the whole universe
It was a big lie NOTHING HAPPENED

( )

With determination Gary places the glass under the tap

ANDY
You dont need to do this Gary

GARY
Yes I do

He pulls the pump CLICK No liquid emerges but -

The Worlds End itself begins to RUMBLE AND SHAKE The
foundations vibrate the glasses rattling furiously

Gary looks at Andy like a naughty schoolboy Oh shit

Suddenly the entire bar and pub floor and bar sinks into the
ground Its as if the pub has become an elevator going down
into the darkest depths of the Earth Then with a BOOM -

The elevator hits the bottom Behind the bar hide Gary and
Andy who look out to see-

INT THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT

A section of the pub sits in a dark chamber underneath Newton
Haven Cables and pipes line the walls evidence of the
active network Only the shaft of light from the Worlds End
above lights the sunken pub floor below

There is a DEEP HUM Gary and Andy peer into the darkness of
the surrounding chamber Around them on two higher ledges of
the chamber stand a SHADOWY CIRCLE OF BLANKS looking down
Gary lifts up the bar to investigate

ANDY
Gary dont go out there-

As soon as Gary steps out a THUNDERING VOICE BOOMS

THE VOICE
Gary King

It is the WELL SPOKEN VOICE amplified to a GODLIKE SURROUND

GARY
Yeah

Suddenly the blanks EYES ILLUMINATE and they collectively

project an ENORMOUS COLUMN OF BLINDING LIGHT in the centre of
the chamber It hums and pulsates Gary squints upwards

( )

THE LIGHT
Gary King of the humans

GARY
Yeah What do you want

THE LIGHT
We want to help you Gary

GARY
Do you now

The LIGHT takes the form of an all-seeing incandescent eye
transforming in time with the sound of its own voice

THE LIGHT
We are here to enable your full
potential as we have with countless
worlds across the galaxy

The Light becomes a powerpoint demonstration of the galaxy
Many planets are highlighted the furthest out is Earth

GARY
Oh yeah Howd you manage that
then

Peter steps out from the shadowy circle now a smiling blank
who speaks in the same WELL SPOKEN VOICE

PETER
We appropriate a small percentage
of the population at two thousand
or so penetration points across the
planet to ensure maximum coverage

OLIVER steps out head intact speaking with the same WELL
SPOKEN VOICE

OLIVER
From there we create ‘simulants’
to spread our ideologies through
peaceful indoctrination

We see a graphic of Earth Points appear across the globe
with concentric circles growing outwards to show coverage

Mr Shepherd steps out to talk in the same VOICE
MR SHEPHERD
Our objective is simple to ready

the population for participation in
our galactic community

( )
lll

PETER
This method requires a small
sacrifice

OLIVER
But the fewer replacements we make
the more successful we consider our
operation

The Reverend steps forward now speaking with the VOICE

THE REVEREND
Of course we welcome those who
volunteer themselves

And now Shane Hawkins appears too Head intact again

SHANE HAWKINS
We can offer attractive incentives
to those who willingly combine

The Marmalade Sandwich step out and talk in unison

THE MARMALADE SANDWICH
The chance to be young again and
yet retain selected memories

OLIVER
Isnt that something youd like

PETER
Something youve always wanted

Now stepping out of the shadowy circle are FIVE INDIVIDUALS
The 18-YEAR-OLD VERSIONS of PETER OLIVER STEVEN ANDY and
GARY They are exactly as we saw them in the prologue

GARY
Oh my god Im so cute Id fuck
me

YOUNG GARY steps down onto the floor and approaches Gary
opening his arms to his older counterpart

YOUNG GARY
The beauty of our system is that we
all win There are no losers

Gary is seemingly enthralled Young Gary smiles

( )

YOUNG GARY
Allow me to carry your legend
forward Let the man you have
become be the boy you were

Gary places his hands on the shoulders of Young Gary

GARY
Nah

WITH SUDDEN VIOLENCE GARY POPS OFF YOUNG GARYS HEAD

GARY
Theres only one Gary King

He drop kicks the head and it splats against the chamber
wall The Light intensifies the hum growing in volume

THE LIGHT
Then you have made your choice
Gary King of the Humans

Gary puffs out his chest He is King Of The Humans a drunk
representative speaking for Earth

GARY
Yeah I have Because frankly who
the fuck are you to come down here
and tell us what to do

THE LIGHT
We are The Network and we are here
for your betterment In the last
twenty-three years have you not
marvelled as information technology
has surged forward

GARY
No

THE LIGHT
Earth has grown smaller yet greater
as connectivity has grown This is
our doing and it is just the
beginning

GARY
Oh fuck off you big lamp

THE LIGHT
You are children and you require
guidance

(MORE )

( )

THE LIGHT (CONTD)
There is no room for imperfection
if Earth is to be a successful
member of our society

GARY
Hey Earth aint perfect humans
arent perfect and guess what I
aint perfect

THE LIGHT
And therein lies the necessity for
this intervention Must the galaxy
be subjected to an entire planet of
people like you

Andy steps into the arena as Garys drunk lawyer

ANDY
Whoa whoa whoa who put you in
charge Who are you to criticize
anyone Gary might be a bit of a
cock and in fact he is a bit of a
cock but hes my cock

GARY
Thanks mate

ANDY

Now Im not going to lie and say
this man is some sort of shining
example far from it And Im not
saying that its wrong to ask for
help its not But help must be
asked for otherwise its just
control

THE LIGHT
But he is a detriment to himself
just as Earth is a detriment to the
galaxy

ANDY
What did you say

THE LIGHT
You act out the same cycles of self
destruction again and again At
this point your planet is the least
civilized in the entire galaxy

GARY
What did he say

( )

ANDY
He’s saying we’re a bunch of fuck
ups

GARY

Hey it’s our basic human right to
be fuck ups This civilisation is
founded on fuck ups and you know
what That makes me proud

ANDY
And me

GARY
What is it they say to err is

ANDY
To err is human

GARY
They say to err is human so errr-

THE LIGHT
We do not believe you speak for all
humanity You are but two men Two
drunk men

STEVEN (0S)
Three drunk men

Steven abseils down from the Worlds End on a piece of
bunting Hes bloodied and battered but very much alive

ANDY
Stevie-baby

Gary and Andy cheer as Steven lands on the floor

THE LIGHT
Enough humans

GARY
Oh youre in trouble now Its
only the fucking Three Musketeers

THE LIGHT
You are revolting against the
wisdom of countless solar systems

GARY
Yeah we are revolting

( )

STEVEN
You said it mate

Gary appeals to the surrounding throng
GARY
Come on we dont have to stand for
this shit Whos with us

Silence

GARY
Anybody

ANDY
Wait you said youre not here to
conquer can I just ask out of
interest how many people did you
have to replace in Newton Haven

THE LIGHT
That is irrelevant

ANDY
Is it Hands up who here is human

Mumbling from the circle One hand goes up

COLLABORATOR 1
I’m human

GARY
One

COLLABORATOR 2
And me

GARY
That’s two

Another voice pipes up from across the room

BASIL
I am but don’t know for how long

Gary Andy and Steven are delighted to see Basil and cheer

GARY ANDY STEVEN
BASIL

STEVEN
So what’s that Three

( )

ANDY
You had to replace an entire town

THE LIGHT
Not the whole town

GARY
Everyone except old nutball and the
shifty twins

STEVEN
That’s a good name for the band
Gary You should write that down

GARY
I will

ANDY
What happened to the ones you
replaced Like Oliver and Pete

BASIL (0S)
I told you not to ask that

THE LIGHT
Redundant vessels are recycled
mulched and converted into
fertilizer whereupon they are
returned to the earth to promote
verdancy and growth It is a highly
efficient means of organic renewal

The Light presents cheery graphics of the recycling

GARY
Mulched

THE LIGHT
It is a relative few in light of
our long term plan

STEVEN
You mean the few hundred thousand
turned to fucking compost

ANDY
And what about the other places
The penetration points

Gary sniggers and makes a euphemistic hand gesture

( )

ANDY
Are they as “successful” as Newton
Haven Because I’m guessing we’re
not the only glitch in your system

THE LIGHT
It is true The Network has been
experiencing some difficulties

STEVEN
You better believe it big balls

THE LIGHT
» and we hope to resolve these as
soon as is conveniently possible

GARY
I think you’ve bitten off more than
you can chew with Earth mate

ANDY
Because we are more belligerent
more stubborn more idiotic than
you can possibly imagine and I’m
not just talking about Gary

GARY
There’s more than one Gary King

THE LIGHT
But you said

GARY
I fucking know what I fucking said

THE LIGHT
Your reliance on profanity is a
measure of your immaturity as a man
and a species

GARY
Oh why don’t you just get back in
your rocket and fuck off to
Legoland you cunts

STEVEN
Yeah stop Starbucking us man

THE LIGHT
It is our duty to challenge you

ANDY
Just eff off

( )

GARY
Yeah eff the fuck off

THE LIGHT
We cannot permit the human race to
continue unsupervised

ANDY
We’re not asking your permission

GARY
Yeah leave us to our own devices
you intergalactic arseholes

THE LIGHT
You misunderstand-
GARY
Oh shut up
THE LIGHT

We are trying-

GARY
Nobodys listening

THE LIGHT
If you’d only-

GARY
Face it we’re the human race and
we don’t like being told what to
do

A pause The Light collects itself Then asks

THE LIGHT
Just what is it that you want to
do

GARY

We wanna be free We wanna be free
to do what we want to do and we
want to get loaded and we wanna
have a good time And that’s what
we’re gonna do

A long pause

THE LIGHT
It is pointless arguing with you
You will be left to your own

devices

( )

GARY
Really

And with that THE LIGHT SUDDENLY SWITCHES OFF Blackness

We hear the sound of an OLD FASHIONED DIAL TONE that
develops into a LOUD RUMBLE as the catacombs start to shake

GARY
They fucked off Result

Gary Andy and Steve cheer and celebrate They look to see
that the blanks in the circle are inert and dead eyed

The blanks power down and some keel backwards like dominos

BANG Sparks fizz from the cables like fireworks Andy and
Stevens smiles fade as the pipes glow a dangerous red

STEVEN
Andy perhaps we should-

ANDY
Gary lets boo-boo

BANG A huge electrical explosion erupts behind Gary

GARY
Yeah its shit here innit

A pipe falls from the ceiling narrowly missing Gary and
crushing the static Oliver instead

The catacombs are now lit only by a growing blaze The gang

followed by Basil and the Collaborators make a break for it

escaping up a ladder at the side of the chamber

EXT THE STREETS OF NEWTON HAVEN - NIGHT

As they emerge from the Worlds End Gary looks up to see The
Worlds End sign on fire Beyond the pub itself throbs from

inside with a powerful red light

They look around to see Newton Haven Smoke-filled fires
starting everywhere the sky turning an ominous red

The few remaining humans climb out and run away fast

COLLABORATOR 1
Well done

( )

COLLABORATOR 2
Thanks a bunch

COLLABORATOR 1
You had to go and spoil it

COLLABORATOR 2
Yeah happy now

Basil appears last

STEVEN
Basil what do we do now

BASIL
Same as before Go

Basil disappears into the smoke leaving our Three
Musketeers lost amidst the gathering apocalypse

GARY
Where’s The Beast
STEVEN
The Beast is dead mate
ANDY
You know what’s really annoying
STEVEN
What
ANDY

I promised myself I wouldn’t die in
this town

Gary hears a familiar RATTLING approach through the smoke

GARY
You’re not going to

HEADLIGHTS Gary runs towards them waving his arms

GARY
Our luck just changed

BOOM The car runs into Gary knocking him violently down

SAM (0S)
Oh crumbs Sorry

Sam pulls up visible through her broken windscreen

( )

STEVEN
Sam You came back for us

SAM

Yes Yes I did Well I got lost on

the ring-road But yes

Gary gets to his feet and limps over to Sam’s car

GARY

Hi Sam could you give us a lift to

London please
SAM

Did you find out what happened to

my brother

GARY
Uh we’ll tell you on the way

They get in the car and hastily buckle up
SAM
Do excuse the mess I’ve been

meaning to clear that up

STEVE
We forgive you Let’s go

SAM
Which way

A FIERY FLASH and OMINOUS BOOM explodes from the World’s End
A HUGE WAVE OF RED PLASMA detonates outward towards the car

GARY
BACKWARDS

The ENERGY WAVE gains on them shattering all the nearby
windows causing destruction and chaos

Sam reverses fast pulls a spectacular J-turn and speeds out
of Newton Haven

In the slipstream of Sam’s car Gary’s tourist map is whipped
into the air where it bursts into flames enveloped by the
plasma wave

EXT THE OUTSKIRTS OF NEWTON HAVEN - CONTINUOUS

Sam approaches the same roundabout she got lost on

( )

SAM
Which way now

STEVEN
Straight over

Sam floors it speeding right OVER THE ROUNDABOUT and away
from the town on a winding country lane

GARY
We can make it

The plasma wave gains inexorably igniting the hedgerows as
the car struggles to outrun its fate Sam drives to escape
the burning countryside a RAPIDLY GAINING TUNNEL OF FIRE

GARY
Were gonna make it

Sams car is just ahead of the gaining fire as it shoots past
the sign saying THANKS FOR VISITING NEWTON HAVEN

GARY
We made it

Not quite The flames of the hedgerows overtake the car The
passengers are engulfed in a BLINDING RED GLOW Then-
BLACKNESS

We hear coughing We see the car through a cloud of acrid
smoke blackened but intact Sam turns the key It is dead
The gang exits the car and start to walk Gary leads them
stumbling toward an orange light in the distance Andy
follows Steven and Sam behind him holding hands

The smoke clears and Gary gazes upon the same panorama he saw
in 1990 The valley bathed in orange light However it is
not the dawn its the town and surrounding fields on fire
The flaming hedgerows make a fiery grid as far as they can
see A nearby pylon blazes showering sparks They sit down
on the brow of the hill looking out across the scene

Gary turns to Andy

GARY
Im sorry

ANDY
I know

Andy puts his arm around Gary They sit regarding Armageddon

FADE TO

INTEXT VARIOUS LOCATIONS

An older Andy talks to a group of younger people around a
fire He is dressed in a medieval looking mish-mash of
contemporary clothing The look and feel of these scenes are
post apocalyptic and neo-gothic with much swirling smoke

ANDY
That morning gave new meaning to
the word hangover We decided to
walk it off all the way back to
London but the headache didnt end
there - it just went on and on
When The Network went down it
triggered a pulse that wiped out
all our technology and sent us
here back to the Dark Ages

We see the Earth reflected in Andys glasses we see pulse
waves spread out all over the globe and then black out

ANDY (VO)
There were casualties of course I
knew a few Some guy at work my
cousin Garys mum Nobody could be
sure how many we lost because we
never heard from the rest of the
world again Things arent
connected like they used to be
Everyone got cut off

We see Andy on his property with his wife and kids tending
an area of arable land surrounded by a chain link fence

ANDY (VO)
Some people say it was better when
they were here I can see that It
isnt easy now but it is simpler
Im back with the wife which is
something We decided our problems
didnt seem as bad in the grand
scheme We live off the land
provide for the family We all had
to go organic in a big way but if
Im honest Im hard pressed to
recall any processed foods I miss

A MINT CORNETTO WRAPPER flutters onto the fence and then
flies away Andys slavering chops betray him

ANDY (VO)
As for the blanks well a funny
thing happened there They woke up
(MORE)

( )

ANDY (VO) (CONTD)
A week or so after The Network
pulled out they just sort of
rebooted by themselves

We see blackened figures in the burnt out catacombs come to
life The blanks awake Peter blinks Oliver sits up to
discover that his head is missing once again He frowns

ANDY (VO)
They seemed lost at first children
cut off from their parents I felt
a bit sorry for them to be honest

The blanks stumble through society Some are pelted with
tomatoes Some reunite with tearful relatives Oliver passes
graffiti reading ‘WE ARE NOT ROBOTS’ He gets dirty looks
from passersby He gives them the finger mouths “fuck off”

ANDY (VO)
The Network was right about one
thing We don’t play nice with
others The Network was right about
a few things to be fair Oliver
went back to being an estate agent
People still need a roof over their
heads and the old Olly always had a
gift for the gab I guess the new
one has too

Oliver now wearing half a football in place of his missing
head shows a young couple into a rough dwelling

He attempts to follow them but bumps into the door jamb

ANDY (VO)
I hear the Petertron went home He
remembered enough to know where
Bishop’s Gardens was I suppose he
just picked up where he left off

We see Peter approach his now overgrown and half-shuttered
house in Bishop’s Gardens

ANDY (VO)
I’m not sure his wife noticed
Maybe she chose not to He’s a
pretty good dad by all accounts

We see Peter sat round the breakfast table with his kids ina
burnt out kitchen He takes off his hand and lets it scuttle
round the table Everyone laughs His wife enters Peter
quickly reattaches his hand and winks at his children

( )

ANDY (VO)
Steven and Sam got together in the
end Didn’t see that coming They
shacked up just outside London
It’s a pretty nice shack too

Sam and Steven appear on the doorstep of an impressive
looking shack Sam kisses Steven who slings a shotgun over
his shoulder and strides off presumably to go hunting

ANDY (VO)
As for Gary

Andy looks ruefully into the distance as he remembers his old
friend almost forgetting he is addressing the group

ANDY
I don’t know what happened to Gary
We got separated and I never saw
him again Some say he went back to
Newton Haven I don’t know why I
think his business there was done

EXT NEW ANGLIA - DAY

We see Gary striding out of the smoke still dressed in his
trench coat which seems somehow more befitting in these
surroundings He carries a broadsword on his back

ANDY (VO)
Wherever he is I hope he’s happy
It’s funny but I miss him I wonder
if he misses me

Striding behind him the BLANK TEENAGE VERSIONS OF ANDY
STEVEN OLIVER AND PETER They are somewhat blackened with
modifications to their garb They too carry medieval weapons

Gary leads them to a pub that stands alone in the smoky
apocalyptic wasteland ‘THE RISING SUN’

He brings them to a halt at the door of the pub and regards
the sign made out of number plates It reads ‘NO BL4 NKS’
INT THE RISING SUN - DAY

The sign clatters across the pub floor drawing looks from the
group of armed rough-looking and very human patrons

HUMAN PATRON 1
Blank bastards

( )

HUMAN PATRON 2
Fucking robots

Gary and his gang of blanks approach the bar and a publican
who eyes them with absolute disdain

GARY
Five waters please

PUBLICAN 13
You can have one but Im not
serving this scum

Gary notes the air of tension in the room and smiles

GARY
Well Im afraid its all for one
and one for all You see my friends
and I are on an adventure a quest
if you will and since we find
ourselves in need of refreshment
you sir have the honour of drawing
first blood So Ill ask you again
for the last time

Tension rises The patrons seem ready to attack

GARY
Five Waters Please

The Publican reaches for a weapon So does every patron in
the bar With lightning speed Gary draws his sword and his
wingmen fall into combat formation behind him

PUBLICAN 13
Who the hell do you think you are

GARY
Me

Behind Gary the eyes of his blank posse switch on and GLOW
BRIGHTLY backlighting Garys final badass line

GARY
They call me The King

Gary charges at the camera Things are about to get messy
