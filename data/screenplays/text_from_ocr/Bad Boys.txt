INT EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY 40
Burnett and Lowrey know theres big problems when at the

41
HOWARD
So heres what were gonna do
Since it was originally your
case you two guys are on point
Sanchez and Ruiz you back them
up with whatever they need
Groans all around
LOWREY

balls to pull this off Theyre
either dead or in the lock-up
pending trial
BURNETT

suit named SINCLAIR He circles close to Burnett and
Lowrey waving his cigar as he speaks
HOWARD
Names Sinclair Internal
Affairs Hes our new proctologist
SINCLAIR
You see whats got me confused
is why risk leaving a witness
Why not kill OFee instead

BURNETT
Because maybe this guy knows if
you kill a cop the whole
departmentll get up his ass
hard and fast

SINCLAIR
And who knows that better than
anybody else Cops

inside job Cops wouldnt pull
