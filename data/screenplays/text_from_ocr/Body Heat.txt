FADE IN
EXT NIGHT SKY

Flames in the night sky Distant SIRENS PULLING BACK

we see that the burning building is mostly hidden by dense
black shapes that define the oceanside skyline of Miranda
Beach Florida Were watching from across town The

sound of a bathroom SHOWER comes to a dripping stop at
about the same time we see the naked back and head of NED
RACINE We continue to PULL BACK INTO --

RACINES APARTMENT - NIGHT

Racine dressed in undershorts is standing on the small
porch off his apartment on the upper floor of an old house
Racine lights a cigarette and continues to stare off at
the fire Weve passed him now into the bedroom of the
apartment and the shape of a young woman ANGELA flashes
by drying her body with a towel

ANGELA (0S)
My God its hot I stepped out of
the shower and stared sweating again
Its still burning Jesus its
bigger And I thought you were making
me hear those sirens

(she giggles)
What is it

RACINE
The Seawater Inn My family used to
eat dinner there twenty-five years
ago Now somebodys torched it to
clear the lot

Angela reappears briefly gathering her clothes She
sits on an unseen bed to get dressed

ANGELA (0S)

ANGELA (CONTD)
I wouldnt mind having breakfast
What do you care Youre watching
the fire Youre done with me Im
just getting into my uniform here

She is in fact slipping on the blouse of her Avis Rent-
a-Car uniform Theres a smile on her lips as she buttons
up watching Racine

ANGELA
Youve had your fun Youre spent
(trying for a
straight face)
Ill just slip into my uniform here
and slip away

RACINE
My historys burning up out here

ANGELA
Hey I dont mind Im leaving
Why do they make these damn skirts
so hard to zip

Now for the first time Racine turns to look at her

She is sitting on the edge of the bed half into her
uniform Racine smiles broadly at the sight and moves
into the room He pushes her back and they both disappear
from sight fabric rustling

RACINE
Wheres your hat

ANGELA (0S)
Hey hey
(giggling)
dont wrinkle it

RACINE (0S)

Whered you hear

Youre spent
that

We are left looking out over the porch at the night And
we go back there across the rooftops to the flames

INT COURTROOM - DAY

An Assistant County Prosecutor named PETER LOWENSTEIN has
been conferring at the bench with JUDGE COSTANZA and now
they both wait as Racine comes into view to join them

The Judge is irritated

JUDGE COSTANZA

JUDGE COSTANZA (CONTD)
ever actually en route from Indiana
or not I think were wasting our
time here Its pretty clear your
client has attempted to defraud the
county in a not very ingenious manner
(he nods at
Lowenstein)
The Assistant Prosecutor has made
what I consider a generous offer
And given that youve failed to
generate even the semblance of a
defense --

RACINE
Judge Costanza perhaps when Ive
presented all --

JUDGE COSTANZA
Yeah yeah If I were you Id
recommend to your client that held
quickly do as Mr Lowenstein here
has suggested -- plead nolo
contendre file Chapter Eleven and
agree never to do business with
Okeelanta County again

Racine is surprised and pleased

RACINE
You would look favorably on that

JUDGE COSTANZA
(nods)
He can walk But dont test my
patience for even five more minutes
If he hesitates Ill nail him

RACINE
Tll talk to him

Racine starts to turn

JUDGE COSTANZA
Mr Racine Next time you come into
my courtroom I hope youve got either
a better defense or a better class
of client

Lowenstein smiles

RACINE
Thank you Your Honor

Racine goes back to his client a Businessman of enormous
confidence and extravagantly untrustworthy appearance

INT STELLAS COFFEE SHOP - FIRST STREET - DAY

Racine and Lowenstein are seated at the counter Racine
drinks beer while Lowenstein drinks a tall iced tea very
rapidly and signals for another This place is across
the street from the courthousepolice station and there
are plenty of lawyers and cops around several of whom
acknowledge Lowenstein and Racine with pats or nods

A single unit air conditioner is blowing away above the
door but it cant compete with the blasts of hot air
that come in with each new patron All of these people
like the pedestrians outside the window have stripped
down to essentials In the infernal heat The lawyers all
carry their Jackets but even so their shirtsleeves are
sweaty The town is sizzling

LOWENSTEIN
-- I think Ive underestimated you
Ned I dont know why it took me so
long Youve started using your
incompetence as a weapon

RACINE
(smiles)
My defense was evolving You guys
got scared Costanza doesnt like
me Whatd I do to him

LOWENSTEIN

Hes an unhappy man Thinks he should
be Circuit Court by now Here he is
in a state with really top-notch
corruption and hes stuck with the
county toilets

(he drinks)
Im surprised you werent in on that
toilet caper Could have been that
quick score youve always been
searching for

RACINE

Maybe Costanza was in on it Thats
why he was mad

STELLA the owner of the coffee shop writes and places
separate checks in front of the two men

STELLA
Whats the word from the hallowed
halls of justice Anything juicy

LOWENSTEIN
Maybe Stella was in on it
(finished his tea)
Stella when you gonna get a real
air conditioner in here

STELLA
You dont like it theres lots of
other places

LOWENSTEIN
They dont have you Gotta go

He stands fishing for change but Racine takes his check
and places it with his own Lowenstein nods and moves for
the door

LOWENSTEIN
You cant buy me No sirree I dont
come cheap

Just before he reaches the door he does a strange thing --
he takes several graceful dance steps in the Astaire
manner

A VOICE
Lowenstein youre a fag

Lowenstein spins out the door where he is blasted by the
heavy air His body droops as he disappears

STELLA
Why does he do that

RACINE
Hes pretty good thats the weird
part

STELLA

Did you hear about Dr Block

RACINE
No Do I want to

STELLA
(leans toward him
confidential)
Agnes Marshall

RACINE
(the thought
disgusts him)
That must have been Mrs Blocks
idea some kind of punishment

STELLA
It was Howd you know Christ
youre plugged in better than me
So you must know about Mrs Blocks
friend in Ocean Grove

Racine winces gets up and puts money on the counter
He lights a cigarette

RACINE
Stella this is beneath even you
Things must be slow

Stella agrees with a shrug as Racine heads for the door

STELLA
Its the heat

EXT FIRST STREET AND MAIN STREET - DAY

Racine makes his way up First to the corner of Main and
crosses diagonally to his building on Main He is well-
known here greeted through glass by many of the shop
owners The heat dominates much of the pantomimed
conversation Racine goes in a doorway and heads up the
stairs to his office

INT RACINES OFFICE - DAY

Racines secretary BEVERLY is behind the desk in the
modest reception room Shes a pretty girl barely past
twenty She pushes some phone message slips toward Racine
and nods toward the sofa A middle-aged woman client
MRS SINGER sits there clutching a walking stick Her
face suddenly is contorted in pain Racine glances
meaningfully at Beverly then turns his full solicitous
charm on Mrs Singer

RACINE
Mrs Singer I would have gladly
come to the house
He helps her up and leads her slowly to his office

MRS SINGER
No no the doctor says I should
walk and I had some shopping Not
that that quack knows what hes
talking about I tell you Mr
Racine Im not sure his testimony
is going to be very useful

RACINE
Dont worry about it Ill find you
a doctor whos more understanding
Is it bad today

MRS SINGER
Oooh you cant imagine Nothing
can make up for the pain theyve
caused me

RACINE
How well I know Well sue those
reckless bastards dry Excuse my
language

As Mrs Singer disappears into the office Racine flashes
a grin at Beverly

MRS SINGER
Dont apologize Thats the kind of
attitude youve got to have these
days

EXT THE BEACHFRONT - NIGHT

The hottest January in fifty years has brought the crowds
to the beach in search of relief But theyve been
disappointed Even the breeze off the ocean seems blown
from a hair dryer Still the nights are a trifle better
and the Beachfront the penny arcades the ice cream stands
and bars are busy even now in the middle of the week

Racine comes out of a bar and lights a cigarette idly
watching the passing parade There is a free band concert
in progress at the band shell Racine wanders in that
direction
EXT THE BAND SHELL - NIGHT

The Miranda Beach High School Orchestra is playing to a
full sweating house the audience is a sea of orange
programs fluttering away as fans People come and go
frequently

The atmosphere is as innocent and informal as the music
the band is playing now

Racine leans against the back rail smoking his eyes
playing over the scene with no expectations

Then down near the center aisle a WOMAN rises As the
band plays on this extraordinary beautiful woman in a
simple white dress moves down the aisle She moves
wonderfully The dress clings to her body in the heat

Racine watches mesmerized as she walks directly toward
him She passes within a few inches of him her eyes
lowered Racines body sways a moment as she goes by as
though buffeted by some force But they do not touch
She goes out onto the Beachfront walkway

EXT THE BEACHFRONT WALKWAY - NIGHT

The Woman MATTY has walked to the rail She stands
there now lighting a cigarette She presents her face

to the ocean hoping for a breeze We move in on her
with Racine

Racine lights a new cigarette and smiles at her She
looks at him and for an instant her eyes race over his
body then she looks back at the ocean

Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg

RACINE
You can stand here with me if you
want but youll have to agree not
to talk about the heat

She looks at him and there is something startling about
the directness of her gaze When she speaks she is cool
without being hostile

MATTY
Im a married woman

RACINE
Meaning what

MATTY
Meaning Im not looking for company

She turns back toward the ocean
RACINE
Then you should have said -- Ima

happily married woman

MATTY
Thats my business

RACINE
What
MATTY
How happy I am
RACINE

And how happy is that

She looks at him curiously She begins walking slowly

along the rail He walks too

MATTY
Youre not too smart are you

Racine shakes his head no

MATTY
I like that in a man

RACINE
What else you like -- Ugly Lazy
Horny I got em all

MATTY
You dont look lazy

Racine smiles
Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg
MATTY
Tell me does chat like that work

with most women

RACINE
Some If they havent been around
much

MATTY
I wondered Thought maybe was out
of touch

She stops again at the rail as a small breeze blows in
from the ocean She turns her back to it and with her
cigarette dangling from her lips she uses both hands to
lift her hair up off her nape She closes her eyes as
the air hits her Racine watches very closely

RACINE
How ‘bout I buy you a drink

MATTY
I told you Ive got a husband

RACINE
Ill buy him one too

MATTY
Hes out of town

RACINE
My favorite kind Well drink to
him

MATTY

He only comes up on the weekends

Matty lets her hair fall and again begins moving down
walkway She drops her cigarette and steps on it

RACINE
Im liking him better all the time
You better take me up on this quick
In another forty-five minutes Im
going to give up and walk away

MATTY
You want to buy me something Ill
take one of these

They have come upon a Vendor selling snow cones

RACINE
What kind

MATTY
Cherry

RACINE
(to Vendor)
Make it two

The Vendor scoops and pours as Racine lays some change on
the cart

RACINE
(to Matty)
Youre not staying in Miranda Beach
(she shakes her
head no)
I would have noticed you

MATTY
Is this town that small

Racine hands her a snow cone They walk over to the rail
Racine watches her eat the snow cone with enormous
interest

RACINE
Pinehaven Youre staying up in
Pinehaven on the waterway
(she gives hima
look surprised)
You have a house

MATTY
Howd you know

RACINE
You look like Pinehaven

MATTY
How does Pinehaven look

RACINE
Well tended

She looks out at the ocean

MATTY
Yes Im well tended all right
Well tended What about you

RACINE
Me I need tending I need someone
to take care of me Rub my tired
muscles Smooth out my sheets

MATTY
Get married

RACINE
I just need it for tonight

Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg

For the first time Matty laughs A moment later she
spills the snow cone over the front of her dress It
makes a bright red stain against the white The thin
material clings to the line of her breast

MATTY
Good Nice move Matty
RACINE
Matty I like it Right over your
heart
MATTY

At least its cool Im burning up

RACINE
I asked you not to talk about the
heat

MATTY

Would you get me a paper towel or
something Dip it in some cold water

Racine starts toward the restroom nearby

RACINE
Right away Ill even wipe it off
for you
MATTY

You dont want to lick it

This causes a momentary hitch in Racines retreat but
then he hurries off

INT MENS ROOM

Racine comes in snaps some paper towels from the rack
and turns on the water The room is full of smoke A
fifteen-year-old Boy is leaning against the wall After
looking Racine over a second he brings the smoking joint

hes been holding behind his back into view and takes a
toke He nods at Racine who nods back and stands up
with his wet towels As he walks out Racine takes a
deep breath

EXT THE BEACHFRONT - NIGHT

Racine comes out of the structure And stops Matty is
gone Racine looks around without much hope Finally
he puts a wet paper towel to the back of his neck We
begin to HEAR a strange measured thumping and then --

EXT THE BOARDWALK (82ND STREET) - DAWN

Racine is running The THUMPING is the sound of Racines
battered running shoes hitting the weathered wooden planks
of the Boardwalk

Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg 12

Racine wears old gym shorts and a torn tee-shirt with
FSU fading from the front The raised wooden walk
works its crooked way through lush tropical vegetation
first coming close to the wide white beach then jutting
back inland swallowed by greenery then shooting out

again toward the sea Racine hits this last stretch at

top speed and launches himself flying out onto the gleaming
sand

EXT BEACH - DAWN

Racine is running on the sand now on a raised hardened
section that bisects the beach His shoes make a weird
whooshing SOUND each time they break the compacted surface
and sink an inch below The sun is just rising from the
ocean to his right yet the day is already broiling
Racines shirt is drenched The WHOOSHING is hypnotic
steady his expression indicates that it is just this
sound which keeps him going

EXT THE BAND SHELLTHE BEACH - DAY

Further on Racine runs by the Band Shell where hed seen
Matty

EXT THE PIER - DAY

The THUMPING returns as Racine runs the long straight
pier directly out to sea toward the rising sun A
lifeguard boat with an outboard motor is on the left of
the pier Racine watches it as he runs until it disappears
beneath him then reappears on his right and turns out to
sea so that it is running beside him Racine speeds up
really kicking racing the boat to the end of the pier
The Lifeguard on board isnt even aware of Racine but he
beats the runner nonetheless then veers off to continue
his business

Racine pulls up breathing hard He walks it off a bit
watching the boat then turns and starts walking back
along the pier He reaches into the waistband of his
shorts and takes out a pack of cigarettes

INT RACINES OFFICE - DAY

Racine is behind the desk Occupying the two seats in
front are a married couple rapidly approaching divorce
They are arguing now each trying to convince Racine of
their view Racine nods occasionally looking from one

to the other But he is also looking between them through
the open door out to the reception room where his
secretary Beverly is kneeling before the lowest drawer of
a filing cabinet Her back is turned and her jeans are
tight across the bottom Theres nothing especially
provocative about her pose Shes just there Working
away

Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg
Racine walks across his office and closes the door He
goes back to his seat The couple continues
EXT THE BAND SHELL - NIGHT
Another concert going on a trio of musicians Racine
moves down the sidewalk away from the audience He looks
around as he lights a cigarette She is nowhere in sight
Racine opens the door to his car a nicked-up red 64
Stingray

EXT PINEHAVEN - DAY
Racine drives past a neat sign --

You are entering
PINEHAVEN

Please drive carefully

Theres money here Many of the homes are not visible
from the street -- only their gates announce their
presence Those that can be seen are sprawling and lavish
The Waterway appears to the left A large white yacht
cruises slowly by
INT RACINES APARTMENT - DAY

Racine sits in bed smoking a cigarette At the mirror a
Nurse in a fresh white uniform steps into her white shoes
and begins attaching her cap with bobby pins

INT COCKTAIL LOUNGE - PINEHAVEN - NIGHT

Dark Almost classy The place is half full Matty is
drinking at the end of the bar her cigarettes next to
her glass The bar chairs near her are empty

Racine comes in looks around walks over and sits in the
seat next to her She looks up surprised

MATTY
Look whos here Isnt this a
coincidence

Racine looks at her almost as though he cant place her
But he doesnt push that effect hard He lights a
cigarette

RACINE
I know you

MATTY
Youre the one that doesnt want to
talk about the heat Too bad Id
tell you about my chimes

RACINE

Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg 14

MATTY
The wind chimes on my porch They
keep ringing and I go out there
expecting a cool breeze Thats
what theyve always meant But not
this summer This summer its just
hot air

RACINE
Do I remind you of hot air

The Bartender has come up
RACINE
Bourbon any kind on the rocks

She thinks then nods her agreement The Bartender moves
away

MATTY
What are you doing in Pinehaven

RACINE
Im no yokel Why I was all the
way to Miami once

MATTY
There are some men once they get a
whiff of it theyll trail you like
a hound

The Bartender brings their drinks and leaves

RACINE
Im not that eager

MATTY

RACINE
(offers his hand)
Ned Racine

MATTY

She takes his hand and shakes it Racine reacts strangely
to her touch and doesnt let go right away She gently
frees it then refers to his look as she picks up her
drink --

RACINE

MATTY
(laughs)
Yes My temperature runs a couple
degrees high Around 100 all the

Maybe you need a tune-up

MATTY
Dont tell me -- you have just the
right tool

RACINE

I dont talk that way

MATTY

Racine gives her a look

RACINE
This is the only joint in Pinehaven

MATTY
Howd you know I drink

RACINE
You seemed like a woman with all the
vices

MATTY

(smiles)

going to be disappointed

Racine looks out over his drink Several of the Men in
the place are looking at them

RACINE
(referring to the
men)
Whatd I do

MATTY
(indicating Racines
chair)
A lot of them have tried that seat

more)
You must come here a lot

MATTY
Most men are little boys

RACINE
Maybe you should drink at home

MATTY
Too quiet

RACINE
Maybe you shouldnt dress like that

MATTY
This is a blouse and a skirt I
dont know what youre talking about

RACINE
You shouldnt wear that body

Natty leans back in her seat and glances down at herself
Shes magnificent

MATTY
I dont like my body much Its
never been right

Racine has been looking at her body too With her line
he just laughs Matty watches him then leans over her
drink Her tone is different

MATTY
Sometimes I dont know I get so
sick of everything Im not sure I
care anymore Do you know what I
mean Ned

RACINE
(hes not sure)
I know that sometimes the shit comes
down SO heavy I feel like I should
wear a hat

Matty laughs studies him

MATTY

Ratty drains her glass and stubs out her cigarette

MATTY
I think Ill get out of here now

She looks at him a long time

MATTY
Thats all If I let you thats
all
RACINE
(gestures his
innocence)

Im not looking for trouble

MATTY
(very serious)
I mean it I like you But my life

is complicated enough
Racine again accepts

MATTY
This is my community bar I might
have to come here with my husband
some time Would you leave before
me Wait in your car I know it
seems silly

RACINE
I dont know who were going to fool
Youve been pretty friendly

She gives him a look and then slaps him hard
turns toward them

Everyone

MATTY
(steadily)
Now leave me alone

She stands up takes her purse and her cigarettes and
walks to the other end of the bar where she sits down
Racine watches her with amazed eyes He stands up and
throws some money on the bar

RACINE
(angry)
Lady you must be some kind of crazy

He stalks out of the bar

INT RACINES CAR - NIGHT

CLOSE on his face as he drives His look is intense
expectant Hes feeling lucky as he watches up ahead

RACINES POV out the windshield Mattys shiny Mercedes
450 SEL is gliding down the road ahead of him She puts

on the blinker slows and turns into a gated drive The
drive is canopied by heavy trees the vegetation crowding
the road with a primeval lushness The headlights create
sinuous welcoming shadows It is as though Racine were
entering some separate parallel jungle world Eventually
the house comes into view

RACINE (0S)
Jesus

Mattys car swings around in the parking area and stops

Racine pulls the Stingray up next to it facing the other
way He watches Matty slide her long legs out of the

car She glances at Racine and for an instant there is a

hint of self-consciousness under the weight of his gaze

We begin to HEAR the soft tinkling of chimes

EXT THE WALKER HOUSE - FRONT TERRACE - NIGHT

Racine follows closely behind Matty as they go up the
stairs At the door Matty turns suddenly and looks at
Racine

MATTY
Remember your promise
Racine agrees Matty looks him over a moment then turns
to unlock the door

INT ENTRY HALLSECOND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT

Matty comes in and puts her purse on a hall table as Racine
moves forward to look around Despite the night gloom

its clear the place is expensively decorated in a manner
entirely consistent with the exterior of the house Fine
antiques carefully chosen fabrics and a meticulous
selection of accessories have given the place the look of
an affluent home of Thirties America And yet the overall
effect is almost contemporary so burnished are the woods
so fresh all the elements It works

RACINE
Just like my place

Matty gives him a searching look then leads him up the
stairs flipping on only an occasional light in their
path In the second floor hall Matty moves to the front
of the house Racine glances into the gloom that hides

Mattys bedroom

Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg 19
RACINE
No help
MATTY

She goes home nights

RACINE
Youre not nervous alone

Matty pauses at the doors to the porch unlocking them
and looks at Racine as though she barely understands the
question

MATTY
No

EXT SECOND FLOOR PORCH - NIGHT

The TINKLING is distinct out here Matty and Racine come
out onto the porch There are about thirty wind chimes

of various lovely designs -- crystal metal wood hanging
at intervals from the rim of the wide porch awning
completely encircling Matty and Racine

Halfway down the long lawn is a white gazebo Beyond it
the waterway is shimmering in the moonlight At the edge
of the water is a small boat house

Racine walks along under the chimes looking up at them
A smile plays across her face He looks back at Matty

RACINE
You do have chimes

He looks out at the boat house

RACINE
Whats that

MATTY
A gazebo

RACINE
No out there

MATTY
Boat house

RACINE

What is in there

MATTY
Boat

Racine moves back and stands very close to her He looks
at her in the moonlight but she concentrates on the
distant water

Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg

MATTY
Its a mess Theres a row boat a
lot of lounge chairs things like

that

Racine puts his hand up under her hair on her nape She
closes her eyes at his touch then moves away as though
by an act of will to the door half opening it

MATTY
I think you should go now

RACINE
I just got here

MATTY

Youve seen them Please go

Racine steps toward her but she ducks inside and moves
through the intermittent light of the hall and down the
steps Racine follows her

INT ENTRY HALL

Matty stops at the entry hall leaning against the wall

RACINE
You didnt bring me here to see your
wind chimes

He puts an arm on each side of her caging her against
the wall She looks up at him

MATTY
Yes I did I said what I meant
Do you ever do that

RACINE
No not very often
He kisses her light on the forehead Again she reacts
but fights it
RACINE

I dont think you want me to go

MATTY
Yes Please

He kisses her lightly on the nose

RACINE
Theres nothing to be afraid of

MATTY
There is for me

Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg 21
Matty slips under his arms and quickly steps out the front
door She stands just outside watching him Racine shakes

his head goes out there

EXT FRONT TERRACE - NIGHT

Racine stops next to Matty She doesnt move away
MATTY
Thank you Im sorry I shouldnt
have lot you come

Racine looks at her a long time

RACINE
Youre not so tough after all are
you
MATTY
No Im weak

She kisses him on the lips and steps quickly inside the
front door She closes it looks through the window at
him then moves away

EXT PARKING AREA - NIGHT

Racine stands looking at the door a few moments Then he

walks to his car Again he stops He looks back at the
house The wind picks up a bit and the TINKLING of the
wind chimes gets louder And then louder

Racine goes back up onto the porch fast He goes to the

front door and looks through the window
EXT FRONT TERRACE - NIGHT

RACINES POV Matty is standing at the bottom of the
stairs in the hall She is looking directly at the front
door Frozen in the spot

Racine tries the door Its locked He shakes it hard
but its solid He looks to his left There are windows
down the wall there He moves to them They go into the
living room but their shutters are closed He looks
through a broken slat at Matty who watches him from the
same spot through the living room door Racine tries
them They wont budge Racine moves to his right past
the front door to the windows off the dining room He
pushes at them as his eyes lock with Matty who watches
from the hall The windows wont move Racine spins and
picks up the nearest object a wooden rocking chair He
lifts it turns and smashes the big window Glass showers
into the dining room

Matty watches She hasnt moved

Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg 22
Racine pushes the broken window out of his way He comes
in like a violent gust of wind

INT HALL

Racine crosses the dark living room fast As he reaches
Matty she lifts her arms to match his embrace They
come together hard and tight They kiss And kiss again
Her hands travel over his body as though shes wanted
them there for a long time

They turn once slowly along the wall into the dimness of
the central hall Then he rotates her body away from
him holding her close

MATTY
Yes yes

Then she is just nodding Racine puts his face deep into
her hair closing his eyes as the smell of her washes
over him

Matty turns in his arms and kisses him hard Racine pulls
her close to him and they sink to the floor

RACINE
Thats right thats right

CLOSE ON Mattys face a look that might be anguish She
bites her lip in expectation Racine moves over her

MATTY
Please please

She pulls him tightly to her clinging like a drowning
woman

DISSOLVE TO

INT MATTYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Racine and Matty lie under a sheet on her big bed Her
eyes are closed There are more wind chimes on the second
floor of the verandah which is off this room and Racine
is listening to their TINKLING Racine looks over in

that direction

RACINES POV The moonlit sheer white curtains on the
window roil to a light breeze Racines gaze travels

over the luxurious bedroom here too it is in the Thirties
style Their clothes are haphazardly thrown across a

divan and on the floor nearby A delicate fern sways in
the wind Finally he is looking at a lovely writing
desk against the far wall Some tissue-thin stationery
flaps in the breeze kept in place by the weight of a
pen Then as he looks the paper stops flapping and the
chimes gradually STOP TINKLING Racine looks toward the
window It is still open but the air had died

Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg 23

The curtains hang still
Racines face The world has stopped

MATTY (0S)

She pulls him down

On the lounge cushions that are spread across the floor

exaggerated pain to the roughness of the cushions

EXT INTERSECTION

A block away from the station the patrol car races toward
an intersection Suddenly a WOMAN steps into the street
pushing a baby buggy Pat slams on the brakes and the

car skids sideways toward the intersection where it rocks
onto two wheels and stops just a few yards short of the
buggy Sam sticks his head out the window

SAM
Are you crazy lady Didnt you
hear the siren

The woman dives to the ground as the BABY sits up in the
buggy -- he is a midget with a cigar in his mouth and a
tommy gun in his hands Pat jerks Sam to the floor just
as the midget opens fire

The midget riddles the car with bullets Headlights
explode windows are smashed the grill is torn to shreds
and steam mushrooms into the air

climb out of the rubble unhurt but very shaken

Traced against a window at the far end of the boathouse
Tracy sees the silhouette of a man Gripping his pistol
he moves silently toward that silhouette closing in on
it while keeping alert for movement

Walker picks up a wine bottle and pours more into each of
their glasses emptying it

RACINE

WALKER

RACINE
What is it exactly

Walker signals to a distant Waiter for another bottle of
wine He does it with a small flick of his finger

WALKER

WALKER
Yes she is Im crazy about her
If I ever thought she was seeing

another guy I dont know
(he takes a sip of
wine)

Id understand how it could happen
Her being the way she is Id
understand it But I think Id kill
the guy with my bare hands

RACINE
Thats understanding

Walker looks at Racine and laughs As he begins to speak

he focuses intently on Racine He seems to be trying to
communicate something other than what hes saying

WALKER
You wouldnt believe the dorkus she
was with when I met her The guy
came to us with a business
proposition Were always looking
for opportunities If the conditions
are right Were willing to take an
occasional risk if the downside
isnt too steep But this guy hadnt
done his homework he didnt know
the bottom line Thats how I knew
he was full of shit Youve got to
know the bottom line Thats all
that really counts
Again Walker takes off his glasses He holds them up to

the light and then rubs them again with his handkerchief

WALKER
He didnt have the goods this guy
He was like a lot of guys you run
into -- they want to get rich they
want to do it quick they want to be
there with one score

He puts his glasses back on stares at Racine

The two men stare at each other a few beats

shakes the table And Racine laughs with him

Racine sits smoking watching Matty fill their tall

highball glasses with ice at the bar

MATTY
I dont know why hes so crazy about

mother has worked plenty hard to
keep Heather on Edmunds mind Always
bringing her around reporting
everything she does in school That
Roz is a smart one And you know
that anything Heather inherits goes
straight to Roz Heather wont even
get a look at it Thats the part I
cant stand Thats why it seems so
wrong to have half of it go to her

She hands him his glass and stands next to him
playing with his hair

She kneels beside him

MATTY

Youll get half of everything and

SLOW DISSOLVE TO
EXT CITY STREET - MIAMI - DAY
Racine locks up a rented Ford on a side street and walks
back two cars to where his Stingray is parked As he
bends to unlock the Stingray he looks around and a passing
car catches his attention
RACINES POV PANNING with the car as it drives by him
There is only one thing extraordinary about this particular
car The driver hunched and intent on the road ahead

is a Clown in full costume and makeup

Racine watches as the car disappears For a moment Racine
looks like a dead man

Matty is leaning against one of the posts that flank the
porch stairs Headlights pass across the front of the
house and Mattys body She smiles a welcoming smile to
the unseen Edmund

EXT TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

A light fog is settling into the dips of the road Now
Racines rented Ford appears out of one such depression
and moves into a clear stretch

INT RACINES RENTED FORD - NIGHT

Racine eyes the fog with concern

EXT WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT

The FOG is much heavier here It rolls in past the house
in thick waves The only light burning is on the front
porch The wind Chimes TINKLE softly

EXT SECOND FLOOR PORCH - NIGHT

The wind chimes TINKLE nudged by the same breeze that
floats the FOG around them

INT MATTYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

The alarm clock -- 150

Again Matty lies on her side turned away from Edmund
eyes wide watching the clock Again the bed moves
suddenly Matty rolls over to look

Edmund is sitting up in bed putting on his glasses

MATTY
Whats wrong

Edmund motions for her to be silent
WALKER
(whispering)
I think theres someone downstairs I
heard something

He swings out of bed he is in his undershorts

MATTY
Are you sure

Again he silences her He walks silently over to his
closet and disappears inside

MATTY
(whispering)
Should I call the police

WALKER
(low from the
closet)
Will you be quiet Im going to
nail the bastard

Edmund comes out of the closet checking the safety on a
shiny nickel-plated 38 revolver

MATTY
(aghast)
Edmund whats that

WALKER
Will you be quiet

MATTY
Ive never seen that

WALKER
(at the bedroom
door)
Ive got a surprise for this fucker

MATTY
Edmund be careful

But he is already out the door silently For a moment
Matty is frozen then she slides out of bed

INT SECOND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT

Edmund has stopped at the top of the stairs He listens
for sounds from below He starts down the steps in the
dark

INT STAIRWELL - NIGHT

Edmund comes slowly down the steps his gun pointing here
then there in his perfectly steady grip The thrill of
the hunt is in Edmunds eyes The downstairs is thick
with ominous shadows At the bottom of the steps he

stops and listens again He moves in two quick steps to
the entry hall and looks into the living room and dining
room He seems to hear something at the rear of the house
He turns and moves back along the central hall very
slowly The alcove under the stairs is pitch black

Edmund points his gun at that approaching space and stops
He listens The TINKLING of the wind chimes rises weirdly
making it hard for him to hear

Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg 71
Edmunds hand reaches out to the wall His fingers find
the light switch He flips it

For a second we are blinded by the glare In the next

Instant as we see that the space below the stairs is
empty Matty screams from the top of the stairs --

MATTY
He has a gun
Edmund thinks she is warning him He spins to look
WALKER

Where

Suddenly Racine bursts from the hall closet the wooden
plank raised above his head He brings it down fast toward
Edmunds head

Edmund reacts instinctively raising his arm the arm
that holds the gun to protect himself The wooden plank
smashes down -- half its force taken by Edmunds forearm
half by his head The gun BLASTS once

One small window in the front door shatters and the bullet
continues into the night

Edmunds revolver slides across the hall floor into a
corner

Edmund is on the floor blood pouring from his scalp

But he is coming on like a crazed beast His glasses
askew but still on his head he has grasped Racine around
the legs With a powerful lunge he pulls Racines legs
out Racine crashes to the hall floor losing the wooden
plank

Matty frozen at the stair railing cries out
Edmund is pulling Racine toward him with all his might

crawling up Racines body as they both slide on the wood
floor Edmund reaches out one huge hand and pulls Racine
even closer

Racine puts his left hand into Edmunds face his thumb
flat against the lens of Edmunds glasses and pushes his
head back The glasses fly away and Racine loses his
hold Edmund comes on

Racines right hand gropes -- gropes -- finds the wooden
plank He swings it up

The wooden plank describes a perfect arc into our view
and then out finding its mark with a HORRIBLE THUD

Matty up the stairs turns away
Racine falls back on the floor

has been spread across the inside Edmunds body flops
down inside He has been dressed his shoes and watch

put on Racine drops the blooded wooden plank beside the
body then throws a blanket over the corpse and slams the
trunk Racine turns to Matty who stands fully dressed
shaking in the foggy air

Spend the fifteen minutes cleaning
up inside then come Youre gonna
have to be careful in this fog

Are you all right

She nods

Racine gets in the Cadillac and pulls away
INT CADILLAC - ON DESERTED BACKROAD - NIGHT

The first stretch of Racines route to The Breakers

looks different in the dense FOG Racine has to take it
slowly
He consults his watch A branch from one of the
overhanging trees looms up abruptly in the windshield
like a grasping arm Racine flinches

EXT NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

Racine drives through the silent neighborhood The houses
are invisible in the FOG their presence indicated only

by an occasional glowing light Suddenly a police SIREN
pierces the night followed by the appearance of a flashing
red light on the street behind the Cadillac

INT CADILLAC - NIGHT

Racines eyes jump to the rear view mirror and the flashing
red light growing in it Racine pulls over The police

car slows as it reaches the Cadillac pulls alongside

and then speeds on ahead SIREN squealing A light goes

on in the house in front of which Racine has stopped He
pulls away

The Cadillac pulls up to the interstate from the side
street

As on the other night there is more traffic here But
it is moving slowly in the FOG

INT CADILLAC - NIGHT

Racine has to cross two lanes of traffic to go south He
peers out through the misted windshield He starts to
pull out and a sports car appears from nowhere doing
fifty sitting on his HORN Racine hits the brakes As
soon as it has passed there is a lull Racine fishtails
across the road just ahead of a truck and moves south

EXTINT CADILLAC - INTERSTATE - NIGHT

The traffic on Racines side of the interstate has slowed
Theres an accident up ahead The police car that passed
Racine is on the scene but the lone Cop is not enough
Some Passing Motorists have pulled over to help with the
wreck and direct traffic The FOG is aglow with flashing
red and white lights and burning flares A Man signals

for Racine to stop The cars in the opposite lanes are
allowed to pass through Racine keeps his head down
A STOCKY TRUCKER comes out of the glowing FOG and walks
up to the Cadillac He leans down into the drivers
window

STOCKY TRUCKER
Hey man do you have any flares

RACINE
Uh -- no I dont think so

STOCKY TRUCKER
(irritated)
Could you check your trunk We got
kinda of a mess here

RACINE
I dont have them I told you

The Stocky Trucker gives him a disgusted look and stands
up

STOCKY TRUCKER
Dont put yourself out

The Man in the road ahead signals for Racine to pull around
into the opposite lanes and move on

barely illuminating the bridge A huge FOG HORN fills

the air from not far way

EXT THE BREAKERS - DELIVERY DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

The deserted hotel looms ghostly in the FOG The Cadillac
lights out rolls silently to a stop in the half-hidden
delivery driveway

INT THE BREAKERS - SUPPLY AREA - NIGHT
Racine carrying only a flashlight has made his way to
the supply area he visited before His beam probes dark
corners responds to random CREAKING Satisfied that he

is alone he moves a wooden crate and reaches into the
hole in the wall which it hid He brings out Teddys
incendiary device and places it on the floor in the middle
of the room

EXT THE BREAKERS - DELIVERY DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

Racine grunts under the weight of Edmunds corpse flung
over his back He stumbles back toward the hulking hotel
The trunk of the Cadillac is closed

INT THE BREAKERS - CORRIDOR - SUPPLY AREA - NIGHT

Racine sits down hard He is streaming with sweat under
the enormous dead weight He adjusts the plastic sheet
so that Edmunds bloody skull wont contact the wall
Racine gathers his strength and half-lifts half-drags
the body down the corridor his silhouette that of a
twisted double-headed monster His flashlight glows
from ahead at his destination

IN THE SUPPLY AREA Racine has dropped Edmunds body over
some tipped shelves Now he lifts the heavy ceiling beam
he spotted earlier He has to change its angle only two
feet in order to let it drop -- now -- on Edmunds head

Racine walks over to the incendiary device He pulls out
the lever and straightens up As he does he looks down a
connecting hallway He sees movement He snatches up

the flashlight and the wooden plank and rushes down that
hallway

AT THE END OF THE HALLWAY Racine slides to a halt
breathing hard Again he sees the movement A horrible
sweaty figure confronts him -- there is a broken mirror
attached to the wall Racine looks at himself a long
moment and the tension seems to drain away

Someone speaks in the shadows

Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg
Racine jumps and spins toward the sound which is only a
little more than a MOAN His flashlight seeks out the

source - a RAGGED BUM is stirring in his sleep on a bed
of newspapers He wears an old baseball cap
Racine looks at him a long time trying to decide what to
do He looks back in the direction of the supply area
He looks at the Bum settling again into a deep sleep He
looks for one final second at himself in the mirror

EXT THE BREAKERS - BEACH - NIGHT

Racine appears at a run from the fog He has the Bum
with him grasped firmly at the neck of the collar and
the seat of his pants Racine is forcing the Bum to run
along with him The Bum is mightily confused not least
by the fact that Racine has jammed the baseball cap all
the way down over his nose -- he can see nothing Racine
lets go hurtling him across the sand

RACINE

(a low growl)

Get the hell out of here and dont
come back

The Bum is sprawled in the sand The baseball cap has
come off He watches Racines dark figure recede in the
fog

RAGGED BUM
(a whisper)
Come on back here and fight like a
man

Racine grabs her and pulls her down out of sight bending
his body low over her

Everything is as Racine left it Edmunds body lies
beneath the beam It is barely discernible in the gloom
The only bright spot in the room is the incendiary device
its shiny surface catching some errant sliver of light

And then it explodes with a harsh SHRIEK And the light
of the magnesium chips is white blinding The chips are
out in all directions to the waiting puddles of gasoline
The light goes from white to yellow as huge flames engulf

moments and then --

(to Racine)
As Ive told Mrs Walker I was more
than a little surprised by the
existence of this new will Edmund
hadnt mentioned anything about it
to me

Hardin looks at Racine a beat but Racine has nothing to
say

HARDIN

Mrs Walker explained to me that
when she and her husband decided to
make some minor changes they just
took care of it up here for
simplicitys sake And indeed as
you know the new will is almost
identical to the old but for the
disposition of a few items

(to the group in

general)
At the risk of oversimplifying the
thrust of the will is to divide the
estate in almost equal parts between
Heather Kraft and Mrs Walker Would
you agree with that assessment Mr
Racine

Racine nods

HARDIN
Mmmm And you witnessed the signing
by Edmund Walker along with this

Miss --
(glancing at papers
on the desk)
-- Mary Ann Simpson on July twenty-

first Apparently it will be
impossible for us to contact Miss
Simpson

Mary Ann is a lifelong friend of
mine She happened to be visiting

on her way to Europe Im sure when
she returns shell get in touch with
me

Im confused too Do you have a
problem with the witnessing or the
signatures What is it youre getting
at

HARDIN
(almost wistful)
No there doesnt seem to be any
problem here This is Edmund Walkers
last will and testament Im afraid
the problem is elsewhere

He reaches into his coat and brings out a gold cigar case

HARDIN
Would anyone mind if I smoked

No one does In fact Racine Matty and Roz all
immediately produce their own packs of cigarettes The
effect is comical and everyone in the room laughs at the
group reflex Roz notices that Lowenstein is not lighting
up and offers him one of hers

Roz smiles and tilts her head to blow a stream of smoke
toward the ceiling We TILT UP with it as the white smoke

intrudes the clear air and --

HARDIN (CONTD)
In writing the will Im afraid Mr
Racine violated whats known as the
rule against perpetuities

Hardin watches Racine who reacts minutely

HARDIN
Its a small thing but its the
law It forbids an inheritance to
be passed down indefinitely for
generations Many general
practitioner lawyers dont fully
understand it It doesnt come up
much for them because wills this
complex are usually handled by estate
departments in larger firms Handled
by lawyers who specialize in this
type of work

Matty turns a confused look to Roz who returns it
sympathetically Hardin notes it

HARDIN
I know this is terribly confusing
but if youll bear with me I

potted the problem right away but
ince Edmunds intent was clear I
hought it in everyones best interest
o try and get the will admitted

nto probate anyway even though it
as technically incorrect I knew
hat a probate judge in Miami would
pot the mistake right away Thats
ll they do all day theyre expert
o I thought Id bring it up here to
eelanta County -- since Edmund had

the residence here -- and see if I
could get lucky with a judge who
didnt know estate law quite so
well

(dryly he cant

resist)
Perhaps find one with the same kind
of training as Mr Racine

Racine watches him his mind racing ahead too fast to

bother being insulted Lowenstein cant help a small

Racine is recovering He gives Hardin a quick ugly look
then turns toward Matty and speaks quietly

RACINE

They asked me to re-do the will I
met with her and Edmund It was
pretty simple This Mary Ann Simpson

Lowenstein and Grace look at him a long time
GRACE
What do you think About the wife

Racine considers a moment

RACINE
I suppose its possible I dont
know much about her except --

-- what Ive seen Wouldnt shock
me either way

intelligent advice and stay away

GRACE

Why not

RACINE

to them

RACINE
That wouldnt be quite so meaningful
except that today she started coming
on to me And maybe you havent
heard but the lady is about to come
into a great deal of money

They look at him with some concern

RACINE
The fact is shes invited me out to

her place tonight And Im going

And Ill keep on going as many nights
or days or weekends as shell have
me

LOWENSTEIN
Ned that lady may have just killed
her husband

Racine smiles cheerfully and puts a reassuring arm around
Lowensteins shoulder leading him to the door

RACINE
Peter shes not gonna inherit
anything by killing me

Lowenstein is out the door now He looks at Racine in
wonder He shakes his head and goes down the steps
Racine turns smiling to Grace but Oscar is grim

GRACE
Ned youve messed up before Youll
mess up again Thats your nature
But theyve always been small-time

got in bad trouble with drugs Speed
Really bad I did things
(she looks up at
him)
Whatevers the evilest thing you can
think of me now I did worse things
then Theres nothing lower than
the animal I was then Worse than
you can imagine I thought I would
die I prayed I would And then
a man helped me He got me clean
He didnt want much in return
either He was a lawyer and he
put me to work in his office I
learned a lot there One time I
even thought I might go to law school
Thats where I picked up the
business about making a will invalid
That happened to him once I swear
I would never have used that if Id
nown about your case I was afraid
to tell you Ned I knew you wouldnt
let me do it Im greedy like you
said I wanted us to have it all

She moves up over him and looks into his face

MATTY
I dont blame you for thinking Im
bad I am I know it Id
understand if you just cut me off
now If you never trusted me again
Youd probably be smart But you
must believe one thing I love you
I love you and need you I want to
be with you forever

She puts her head on his chest as Racine lights a
cigarette

RACINE
They already think youre involved

MATTY
I dont care
RACINE

to Grace
LOWENSTEIN

He is mad

RACINE
Nooo No Im not mad Why should
I be mad just because my friend here
who Ive know for years wants to
know of my whereabouts on the night
of our recent local murder

LOWENSTEIN
Its not so recent anymore Maybe
hes feeling some pressure

Grace is pained by all this but his tone is scolding
defensive

GRACE
You brought this on yourself man
I dont run this department you
know There are people watching
this thing They hear youre out

So dont give me shit

Lowenstein goes to Oscars desk and takes a pull from the

RACINE
Thats my business

GRACE
This whole damn case is getting crazy

fanatic about them

there He says that even after the
fire the frames shouldve been seared
into his -- well you dont want to

So what

GRACE

So its looking more and more like
he was killed somewhere else and
brought there in his own car Your
honey his wife says he left the
house in the middle of the night
driving himself to some mysterious
meeting Is that vague enough for
you

RACINE
Look what is this What do you
want Am I supposed to be an
undercover agent for you guys or
something

LOWENSTEIN
Interesting choice of phrase

RACINE
How bout tonight I ask her Say

No sign of life Still the HUMMING its a Broadway show
tune

EXT END OF THE PIER - NIGHT

Lowenstein is there all alone silhouetted in the
moonlight He uses the rail like a ballet bar returning
to it each time he finishes a small combination of dance
steps The moves are not extravagant there is not
highkicking Just a nice smooth little combination that
Lowenstein is repeating again and again

He HUMS his own accompaniment Then softly at first
from the distance comes the THUMPING of running shoes on
old wood It grows as Lowenstein completes another
repetition When the THUMPING has gotten close it slows
then stops raggedly Lowenstein looks that way

Lowenstein glances at Racine

Buddy your lawyer is present

You know that Edmund Walker was a
bad guy The more I find out about
him the happier I am hes dead I
figure its a positive thing for the
world

RACINE
Youre not known for being a
hardliner

LOWENSTEIN

Mmm I have my own standards I try
to keep them private

(he looks at his

cigarette)
As far as Im concerned I dont
care who killed him And I dont
care who gets rich because of it

(shakes his head)
But Oscar Oscars not like that

know like that Sometimes its a
real pain in the ass Even for him

pain

woman herself was gone looked
like she left in a hurry

but only for a moment

Oscar thought any story she could
tell might help you He thinks you
need help

Racine turns around drapes his arms back along the rail
and lets his head loll like a tired runner

LOWENSTEIN
Someones putting you in deep trouble

to five AM on the night Walker was
killed someone called your hotel
room repeatedly The hotel didnt
want to put them through but whoever
was calling convinced them it was an
emergency The phone rang and rang

butt)

are held apart a fraction of an inch by something Racine
crouches down to look through the crack

WHAT RACINE SEES The curtains are being held apart this
little bit by a wire A wire which is attached to the
window and runs tautly back into the gloom of the
boathouse Racine shifts his head an inch and he can see
another wire It originates from that same spot back in
the gloom and runs toward the door although Racine with
this limited view cannot actually see where the wire is
attached But Racine is not really trying --

Racine has rocked back on his heels away from the window
He stands up and steps away from the boathouse You might
call it a stagger

INT GRACES OFFICE - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Lowenstein is in a chair Grace is turned away looking
out the window at the dark street They both look dejected
After a long silence --

LOWENSTEIN
Stupid Thats always been the
problem
(a beat)
Her mind encompasses his

GRACE
I better go get him

EXT REAR OF WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT

The house looms darkly Racine has packed the Stingray in
the black shadows of the big tree behind the house hiding
it He starts to walk back around the driveway side of

the house when something catches his eye at the other end
of the house He walks over there

Close to that far wall in shadow as deep as the one he
has just used is to Racines surprise -- Mattys
Mercedes Racine stares at the car
EXT RACINES BUILDING - NIGHT

Grace comes out of the house and walks to his car

EXT GAZEBO -- WALKER HOUSE - NIGHT
Close on Racines watch -- ten-o-five

The wind chimes on the gazebo TINKLE Racine sits smoking
in the shadows He takes another drink from a glass of
liquor All the lights on the lawn gazebo and boathouse
are off Racine hears something and peers toward the
driveway Headlights move very slowly up the drive toward
the house It is Edmunds Cadillac glowing in the
moonlight

The Cadillac stops in front of the house and for several
moments nothing happens Then Matty gets out of the car
Waterway

She is wearing the same white dress she was wearing when
Racine first saw her and she is luminous in the moonlight

Racine watches from the blackness of the gazebo Silently
Matty walks twenty feet past the gazebo and stops when
she can make out the boathouse in the gloom She stares

at it a moment then turns back toward the house

Racine steps to the edge of the gazebo Matty seems
startled for only a split second
MATTY
Hello darling

RACINE
Hello Matty
MATTY
Wheres your car
RACINE

In the back With yours

MATTY
Why havent you turned on the lights

RACINE

Matty comes up the steps and puts her arms around him
She closes her eyes as she hugs him They are one figure
melded in the gloom

MATTY

RACINE

Suddenly she backs away from him down the steps her
white dress moving back into the bright moonlight from
the shadow of the gazebo She looks up at Racine

RACINE

He has it in his hand now He looks it over casually but
the barrel is toward her

MATTY

EXT STREET NEAR WALKER PLACE - NIGHT
Graces car moves up the street past the gated drives
EXT BACK LAWN - NIGHT

Racine is at the bottom of the gazebo steps now Matty
has backed away toward the Waterway

MATTY
I did arrange to meet you But Ned

Racine laughs short and bitterly
RACINE
You never quit do you You just
keep on coming

MATTY
How can I prove it to you What can
I say

RACINE

The glasses Matty Why dont you go
down there and get them

Matty is silent She starts to speak but nothing comes
out Now there is real fear in her eyes

MATTY

Racine has moved closer to Matty away from the house
They are only six feet apart Tears are now rolling down
Mattys cheeks

MATTY

She turns and starts walking toward the ocean Just as
she is about to disappear into the shadows she turns
back to him

Ned no matter what you think I

do love you

AT THE CORNER OF THE HOUSE

Grace has gotten out of his car He starts toward the

front door but sees Racine out on the lawn He heads out
in that direction but stops as Racine steps into a bright
spot of moonlit lawn and the guns shiny silverplate glints
in the light The gun is pointed at the retreating Matty

Grace pulls his own gun from a shoulder holster and raises
it He is about to call out when Matty disappears
completely in the gloom Racine lowers the revolver wearily
and stares out toward the boathouse Grace lowers his

gun and looks out there too He moves slowly forward

Close on Racines face Its changing now Its not just
that hes very tired The hardness is going out of his
look As the seconds tick by and Matty does not reappear
he begins to lose faith in his view of the world He begins
to be afraid Afraid for Matty Even now

A sudden breeze starts the wind chimes TINKLING loudly

RACINE
No Matty Stop Dont go in Matty

Racine breaks into a run dropping the revolver on the
grass He has taken two big strides when --

There is a sound like the ROAR of a dragon and the roof

of the boathouse lifts and then disappears in a huge BALL
OF FLAME The air is sucked around Racines body whipping
at his clothes as he stumbles on the lawn and falls
forward

Grace steadies himself against the side of the gazebo
Racine knows horror He struggles to his feet and stumbles
toward the fire His body is silhouetted against the
leaping ROARING flames in the night sky

SLOW DISSOLVE TO

INT RACINES CELL BLOCK - FLORIDA STATE PENITENTIARY -
NIGHT

Absolute quiet We move above cell after cell dark with
sleeping convicts

We stop at Racines cell It is dark like the rest Racine
is in there alone We move down close to his sleeping
form He looks thinner

Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg 117
Suddenly he wakes with a start His eyes snap open wide

he is totally and instantly awake He talks to himself
with true amazement
RACINE
Shes alive

INT VISITORS CENTER - FLORIDA STATE PENITENTIARY - DAY

Grace sits on the other side of the glass from Racine
They talk on telephones Graces eyes are sad they say
he thinks Racine is going crazy

RACINE
But what if that was someone elses
body in there What if it was already

there when I got there -- dead and
waiting for me Maybe her friend
Mary Ann

GRACE

Her teeth were left man We sent
them back to Illinois The
identification was positive That
was her that was Matty Tyler Walker
That was her and shes dead

RACINE
Youre not listening to me What if
shes been using this other girls
name Since she met Walker three
years ago since she first spotted
him and decided to take him one
way or another Maybe Walker -- or
any of us -- never knew her real
name

GRACE
Why would she want to hide her
identity

RACINE
I dont know Maybe there was
something in her past something so
bad she was afraid it would queer it
with Walker if he found out -- that
hed never marry her

Grace is unreceptive to this But Racine is charged

RACINE
Lets say shes living as the other
girl this girl from her past Someone
whose history she knew and could use
any way she wanted And theres only
one person in the world who knows
the truth
(MORE )

RACINE (CONTD)
(he leans in)

And then just when Mattys got me on
the line when shes finally going
to collect that one person shows
up That girl Finds her And
threatens to expose her So Matty
starts paying her off Maybe she
even promises to cut her in on
Edmunds money Now shes got to
share it with two people

Racine peaks tapping the glass between them as though it
were all there for Grace to see

RACINE
But when Matty sees a way to get rid
of both of them at once A way to
solve all her problems and get clear
with no one looking for her At the
boathouse You find two bodies me
and this girl Two killers dead
Case closed

Oscar isnt buying
RACINE

You cant find the money can you
Oscar Doesnt that tell you

something

GRACE
It tells me she moved it and we cant
find it And that dont mean shit
It could be sittin’ in any bank in
the world waiting for a dead lady to
come for it

Racine calmer now shakes his head no

GRACE
Do you hear what youre saying Its
crazy This Matty wouldve had to
been one quick smart broad
Racine confirms Graces fears with a look that can only
be called half-crazed Theres the glimmer of a rueful
smile

RACINE

Oscar dont you understand That
was her special gift she was
relentless

(much quieter)
Matty was the kind of person who
could do what was necessary Whatever
was necessary

These words have no special import to Grace He looks at
Racine without hope

GRACE
Racine you got to face something
You killed Edmund Walker man And
youre going down for it Two people
are dead And no matter how you want
to figure it you aint bringin
either of em back to life

Grace gives him a long look then hangs up the phone He
stands up and walks away Racine sits and stares

DISSOLVE TO
INT RACINES CELL BLOCK - DAY

Racine bearded now comes to the front of his cell to

get his mail A Trustee hands through a book-size manila
envelope which has been neatly opened by the prison
authorities Racine looks at the return address and becomes
very intense He sits on his cot and slides out a book A
letter is clipped to the front Racine scans it quickly
and begins looking through the book

It is an old high school yearbook Racines fingers are
shaking slightly as they leaf quickly past black and white
scenes of youthful innocence among the Wheaton High School
Cougars of 1966

He reaches the individual pictures of the seniors and hi
hurries through the Os and Rs to the Ts

Racines eyes are darting over the pages Suddenly they
stop He has found her entry We see it too --
MARY ANN TYLER

Home Economics Matty
TRI-Y 29 39 4 CHORUS
Ambition -- To Graduate

The picture is not great The pretty face is a little
cheap-looking It is not the Matty he knew It is her
friend from the back verandah Mary Ann

Racines eyes dart He thinks Then he flips back a few
pages He finds what he wants --

MARY ANN SIMPSON

English

TRI-Y 2 3 4 CHORUS 2 3 4

HOMECOMING PRINCESS 3 4 SWIMMING 2 3

Ambition-- To be rich and live in an exotic land

Were very close on the type of her ambition when we pan
up the page to her smiling face Her smile is so big she
seems almost to be laughing

Racines face Thats the woman he loved

Back to her picture Were moving in on it Closer Closer
And then through it --

To her real face this Matty this Mary Ann alive and
fine in the sun of --

EXT A HIGH PATIO - AN EXOTIC LAND - DAY

One shot very close on that lovely face moving around
it in a tight half-circle that barely lets us glimpse the
sun-drenched foreign town far below and the tropical
foliage that surrounds the patio For one brief moment
she seems to be crying But no it is not a tear It isa
little drop of sweat She wipes it from her cheek as she
turns to an unseen male COMPANION who has spoken to her
in Spanish She wipes her eyes and looks off at him

COMPANION (0S)

MATTY
What

COMPANION (0S)
It is hot

MATTY
Yes

She turns her face to the sun

THE END

FADE OUT
