RED SPARROW
INT BEDROOM - APARTMENT - BRUSSELS - MORNING

A songbird chirps outside

Gazing out windows at a magnificent rooftop view of Brussels
in the hush before daybreak To the right of the windows a
vanity with a large mirror and a sleeping cat on its tabletop

The naked tangled bodies of a YOUNG WOMAN and an OLDER MAN
asleep on a bed can be seen in the mirror A serene stillness
as the sun breaks and floods the bedroom with warm light

SUPER Brussels Belgium March 1976

IN THE MIRROR we see the woman roused by the sun A beat

She beckons for his Massages it to attention Sliding up

his chest she straddles him Husky gasps as she gracefully
grinds down The half-asleep man comes alive with her pleasure --
meets her movement intensity building their shuddered

breaths become one --- until he cums and they collapse
together

ANGLE ON BED sun-stroked lovers in a hazy embrace --- stoned
with satisfaction comfort --- good morning

DOMINIKA EGOROV mid twenties natural effortless beauty ---
deep allure --- bohemian laissez-faire style and grace ---
Jane Birkin but with haunted eyes

Next to her COLONEL FRANCOIS GUILLOT a Belgian man 50s
Kissing Guillot Dom gets out of bed grabs the portable
cassette player off the vanity --- a glance back at him as
she disappears into the bathroom

Guillot leans to a chair a NATO uniform hanging off it He
pulls out a cigarette lights up takes a drag smiles to
himself as we HEAR water running into a tub in the bathroom

INT BATHROOM - BEAT LATER

Dom in front of a mirror not so much looking at herself as
she is for herself An undercurrent of tension in her eyes
Moving to the clawfoot tub next to a big window Dom cuts
the water hits play on her tape-deck The Velvet
Undergrounds Sunday Morning --- slips into the bath

The tension in her eyes disappears when Guillot enters He
gets in the tub sits across from her They trade smiles

GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
When were old and gray -- promise
me that we will still have mornings
like this Always this --- forever
DOM (IN FRENCH)
A proposal

GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
Absolutely

DOM (IN FRENCH)
We only met 6 weeks ago

GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
But Ive known you for a thousand
years ---

Dom rolls her eyes a so cheesy look at Guillot Putting
her feet on his chest he soaps and lathers her legs up

DOM (IN FRENCH)
The NATO Colonel and the anti-war
activist --- an odd couple

GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
Youre the ying Im the yang

Dom grabs a safety razor slowly begins to shave her legs

DOM (IN FRENCH)
And what will your colleagues say

GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
What will yours
(lock eyes with Dom)
I dont care I want us to work

DOM (IN FRENCH)
How am I to live happily ever after
with a career soldier

GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
I am a soldier for peace

DOM (IN FRENCH)
Yes whose job it is to promote the
proliferation of nuclear weapons ---

GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
As deterrents

DOM (IN FRENCH)
Do you want our children to grow up
under the specter of annihilation

GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
Of course not ---
DOM (IN FRENCH)
Then help me change things Youre a
soldier for peace Prove it

GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
This is ridiculous Prove it how

Dom stops shaving hard look at Guillot

DOM (IN FRENCH)
Is the Defense Planning Committee
going to advocate the deployment of
Pershing II GLCMs along the curtain
line to counter Soviet SS-20s

Guillot sits back and stares at her stunned and confused

GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
I Im sorry -- I cant answer that

DOM (IN FRENCH)
You mean you wont

GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
What

DOM (IN FRENCH)
Youre deputy chief of NATOs Division
of Defense Planning and Policy If
anyone knows its you

GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
How could -- I never told you I was
with the DDPP We never discussed --

Doms gaze unwavering as the realization hits Guillot like a
bat to the head

GUILLOT (IN FRENCH) (CONTD)
Youre from the Center arent you
Youre from Moscow

DOM (IN FRENCH)
If I were would it make a difference

He shuts his eyes annihilated

DOM (IN FRENCH) (CONTD)

Francois ---
Guillot starts to cross his arms --- Dom leans in to touch
him prevent him from closing up --- and he SLAPS her hard

drawing blood He recoils horrified at himself at her Dom
remains calm maintains eye contact
DOM (CONTD)
There are snapshots of us documents
that I photographed (beat) If you
dont work for them they have more
than enough to convince your
colleagues that you do ---

Guillot breaks down with a shattered gallows chuckle

GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
A honeytrap Pathetic Cant trust
anyone anymore Not even myself

DOM (IN FRENCH)
I do care about you Francois ---
let me help you through this

GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
What you do for a living -- its the
worst fucking business in the world

Dom nods After a beat ---

DOM (IN FRENCH)
But theres no other way out ---

Guillot suddenly snatches the safety razor

GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
Theres always a way out

Dom lunges for the razor but Guillot JAMS his legs hard
against her chest and PINS her back He pops out the blade
looks her dead in the eye and brutally slits open his wrists

Guillot roughly holds a struggling Dom still as a cloud of
blood gushes from his veins and into the water towards her ---
and after a minute or so he finally releases her Dom jumps
out of the bath body stained with blood

DOM (IN FRENCH)
You dont have to do this

Guillot reclines to bleed out in comfort Finally Dom turns
wets a towel in the sink quickly cleaning herself

GUILLOT (IN FRENCH)
You can wipe the blood off but you
and I will always be unfinished
business

They share a last look He turns to gaze out the window

DOM (IN FRENCH)
Ill let the cat out when I leave
Dom leaves the bathroom After a few beats her footsteps
rushing out of the apartment -- she shuts the door And then
all we can hear is a song bird CHIRPING outside

Thought he was vulgar

Through the smile Nate sees the pain in Korchs eyes

NATE
Hes got a show up at the Hilton in
Las Vegas You and I could be there
by August Just say the word
KORCHNOI
Someday perhaps but for now we
still have work to do Which reminds
me I must ask you something

Thats the rule

KORCHNOI
This is extremely important Nathan
The subject of intense concern within
the Kremlin It has to do with
Kissinger Some distressing intel ---

NATE
Upset about what

KORCHNOI
(a dramatic beat)
Is Kissinger fucking Raquel Welch

Nate flashes a screw-headed grin but Korch is stonefaced

KORCHNOI (CONTD)
Is it true Is he defiling her

Nates grin turns into giggles --- but Korch is insistent

KORCHNOI (CONTD)
Our sources say that Kissinger has a
lopsided cock which becomes quite
engorged when erect is this how he
attracts them or just propaganda

Nates giggles roil into hysterical laughter

KORCHNOI (CONTD)
How does this grotesque little ghoul
of a man bed so many beautiful women

It isolated a common dominator in
all these men

KORCHNOI
Every one of them had a negative
relationship with his father which
is strange because I had a wonderful
bond with my father ---

NATE
You think hed see you as a traitor

KORCHNOI
He loved this country a true patriot

NATE
So are you Youre betraying your
government in order to save your
people ---

Korch finds strength in the conviction in Nates eyes

KORCHNOI
And you You never speak of your
father ---

NATE

Not much to say I was a mistake to
the man A bad beat Only met once

KORCHNOI

a spectacular improbable run Your
contribution is impossible to measure

KORCHNOI
If your commanders knew you were

burned alive like Penkovsky

KORCHNOIL

Funny I was planning on giving you
some very similar guidance ---

NATE

Korch slaps his hand over Nates heart

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
Youve got too much left tit

NATE

No You listen What do you truly
want out of life Who do you want to

GONDORFF (CONTD)

Marbles people are gonna know they

This sends Nate spinning

NATE
But they already know whats at
Vorkuta Marble told them

GONDORFF
Companys in the shitter right now
Congress has our balls in a vice
the White House has a knife to our
throat --- and Bush is a cunt Wants
to put some easy points on the board
by giving the president an ace in
the hole for the SALT talks ---

NATE
Why didnt you tell me Why didnt
you let me warn him

GONDORFF
I was given direct orders by Benford
He didnt want to risk Marble holding
back on this latest take

Overwhelmed with rage and disgust Nate pops out of his chair

NATE
Hes gonna think I knew Hes gonna
think I fucked him

GONDORFF
Thats just it Nate this isnt
about you The sooner you come to
terms with that the less painful
this jobs going to be

NATE
The average survival rate for our
agents here in Moscow is 11 months
Marbles been out in the wilderness
giving us everything for 16 years
And you guys treat him like a fucking
dixie cup

GONDORFF

EXT LAKE - DACHA - COUNTRYSIDE OUTSIDE OF MOSCOW - DAY

A large Dacha (country house) overlooks a rollicking
retirement party for a GRU General Music kids playing the
top echelon of the Soviet complex getting shitfaced

Amid the older heavies is the new wave KGB LIEUTENANT COLONEL
IVANOVICH EGOROV 36 unconventionally attractive modish
groove cool confidence He plays GO and observes the action
while holding court at a table of young KGB and GRU sharks

A military vehicle pulls up to the party Egorov observes

TWO UNIFORMED OFFICERS get out and hurry to the most powerful
person at the party DEFENSE MINISTER SERGI GRENCHENKO Taking
Grenchenko aside the Officers give him displeasing news

ANGLE ON KORCH seated on the grass eyes shut basking in
the sun VERA early-50s radiantly cute sits next to him
Korch looks over and sees her smiling at him and smiles back
delighted to see her He tenderly kisses her hands

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
Vera --- its so good to see you
How are you The children

VERA (IN RUSSIAN)

Im much better -- Larisa is still
teaching in St Petersburg and
Svetlanas six months pregnant ---

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
Wonderful

VERA (IN RUSSIAN)
I just wanted to thank you The
letters you sent after Pavel died
meant so much Knowing youd come
through the loss of Anya (Beat) You
helped me get through the worst of
it

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
Im glad

Charmingly awkward tension like teenagers Interrupted by A
ROAR OF JABBERING they turn toward a DEBAUCHED RETIRING
GENERAL dancing and crying with a comrade Vera chuckles

KORCHNOI (CONTD)
Dont laugh A few more years and I
suspect that will be me ---

VERA (IN RUSSIAN)
And then what

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
I dont know Its hard to imagine
life outside the Aquarium

VERA (IN RUSSIAN)
(sweet smile)
Well perhaps I can help you ---

Seeing that Korch is clueless Vera takes a brave breath
puts her hand on his and locks eyes with him

VERA (CONTD)
Come over for dinner

His surprise flits to delight -- which melts away when hes
struck with the impossibility of it all Reading his
resignation as rejection Vera fights back her vulnerability
Korch is about to apologize when a uniformed Soldier appears

Gazing across the party at Egorov as he watches Korch and
other powerful men heading inside sensing somethings up
His suspicion is confirmed when a soldier approaches him

INT DEN - DACHA - BEAT LATER

Egorov steps into a cozy den and finds Korch GENERAL ANDRE
SOKOLOV FIRST DEPUTY CHIEF OF THE GRU two senior-level KGB
DEPUTIES for counterintelligence and operations and A DEPUTY
FOREIGN MINISTER

Egorovs KGB seniors are irritated by his presence Unruffled
by their vicious glares he nods at them respectfully

Grenchenko The Defense Minister rumbles in sits at a table
with six chairs --- everyone but Egorov joins him In the
center of the table a basket of freshly-picked mushrooms

GRENCHENKO (IN RUSSIAN)
Ive just received word that the
Americans have positioned a KEYHOLE
over the Vorkuta research complex ---

Easy to see that all but the Dep Foreign Minister understands
the ominous gravity of this revelation

DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)
If I may ask what kind of research
GRENCHENKO (IN RUSSIAN)
Multiple independently targetable
reentry vehicles for heavy missiles

DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)
MIRVs are a direct violation of the
SALT treaty If the Americans use
this it will undermine our position
for the SALT II talks -- embarrass
Chairman Brezhnev --

GRENCHENKO (IN RUSSIAN)
(cuts him off)
Yes yes Im not interested in
discussing the consequences right
now only the cause --- of which
there can only be one

Picking a mushroom from the basket Grenchenko pulls out a
pocket knife and slices it into pieces

GRENCHENKO (IN RUSSIAN)

Weve been compromised And
determinations must be made before I
can brief the committee ---

(eats piece of mushroom)
Is this a technical breach Have our
communications been penetrated Or ---
do we have a mole

The table contemplates No one wants speak first Korch
especially uptight throws an acid glare at the KGB guys

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
How many years have I been warning
you about this How many reports
have I submitted about just such a
breach

KGB DEPUTY COUNTERINTEL (IN RUSSIAN)
Yes Vladimir Korchnoi but we found
no conclusive evidence to support
your concerns

SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
And now comrade is an American
satellite conclusive enough for you

KGB DEPUTY OPERATIONS (IN RUSSIAN)
Vorkuta is a military program over
which you asserted complete primacy

GRENCHENKO (IN RUSSIAN)
Enough If anyone else points a
finger Ill cut if off I wanta
determination
SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
(after a beat)

Vorkuta is one of our most secure
programs Everyone there is
quarantined Only a handful of the
senior levels are even aware of its
existence (Beat) The probability is
much higher for a technical
penetration ---

Grenchenko looks at the KGB Deputy Counterintel

KGB DEPUTY COUNTERINTEL (IN RUSSIAN)
We are inclined to agree with this
initial assessment ---

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
What about this affair last week
with the American ops officer Nash

Everyone turns to Egorov KGB guys furious that he spoke

GRENCHENKO (IN RUSSIAN)
Is there a connection

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
Aside from the proximity of these
events --- Nash went to extraordinary
lengths to return to station ---
risking his life on several occasions

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
So what of it

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
I dont believe he wouldve gone to
such extremes to protect a mere line
tap Only a vital asset

KGB DEPUTY COUNTERINTEL (IN RUSSIAN)
Have you read our assessment of Nash
The man is a sex fiend a marginal
operator ---

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
A marginal operator who managed to
outwit a 65-man detail evade a full-
scale roundup and was out of pocket
for more than 12 hours

The KGB men look like they want to eat Egorov alive

KGB DEPUTY COUNTERINTEL (IN RUSSIAN)
Yes I read the report and while
noteworthy I dont agree theres a
connection

(MORE)

KGB DEPUTY COUNTERINTEL (IN RUSSIAN)
(looks atCNéniehenko)
Our resources would be better served
focusing on a technical breach

GRENCHENKO (IN RUSSIAN)
I want new security protocols
implemented for every organ of the
apparatus --- and your action regimes
on my desk by tomorrow afternoon
(dismissing everyone)
Thats it

Everyone gets up and heads towards the door

EXT DACHA - BEAT LATER

As the men from the meeting leave Korch pulls Sokolov aside

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)

SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
The dark prince Vanya Egorovs son ---

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
Kruschevs hatchet man at the Center

SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
(nods )

Vanya kept a ledger of everyones

dirty secrets And when he retired

he gave it to his son --- who has

used it most effectively

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
Id like to see everything we have
on him

INT DEN - DACHA - CONTINUOUS

Egorov stands casually at attention in front of Grenchenko

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
A technical breach leaves them all
blameless --- the easy way out

GRENCHENKO (IN RUSSIAN)
No one wants to contemplate a
penetration of the top echelon ---
(MORE )

GRENCHENKO (IN RUSSIAN) (CONTD)
to hunt for such a traitor is to
hunt ourselves which could cause
much more damage than the mole ---

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
Are you saying we cannot pursue this

GRENCHENKO (IN RUSSIAN)
I am saying that most are content to
take the good lie over the bad truth

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
Not me

Grenchenko eyes Egorov coldly realizing what hes saying
DEFENSE MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)
If you do this and fail nothing can

protect you ---

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
And when I succeed

DEFENSE MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)
What do you want

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)

soap in hand The water is running She stares at the bathtub --
lost in the trauma-trance of a bad memory

TATI (0S IN RUSSIAN)

Dom doesnt notice Tati come in and give her a worried look
Tati gives her big sister a deep hug from behind

TATI (CONTD)
I want to show you something ---

INT LIVING ROOM - DOMS APARTMENT - MOSCOW - MOMENT LATER

As Tati leads Dom into a spacious Bohemian room we see the
walls are covered with Tatis photos of their family their
lives and many of a younger Dom as a ballet dancer

Tati directs Dom to the photo drying on a line a Diane Arbus-
like portrait of a big old rough-and-tumble Russian woman
with no legs in a wheelchair laughing so hard shes crying

Anxious about Doms opinion Tati lights a cigarette
Absolutely enthralled by the photo Dom snaps out of her
spell and we see her smile for the first time

DOM (IN RUSSIAN)
Its wonderful ---

TATI (IN RUSSIAN)
Really

DOM (IN RUSSIAN)
The depth and detail of the moment ---
the joy triumphing over the tragedy --

TATI (IN RUSSIAN)
Youre moved by anything broken or
crippled ---

DOM (IN RUSSIAN)
Its how we all truly are isnt it
(teary look at Tati)
I love it One of your best

The sisters share a smile of gratitude and love for each
other Dom puts her arm around Tati kisses her on the head

A KNOCK ON THE DOOR Tati flits over and looks through the
peep hole goes rigid Turns to Dom

TATI (IN RUSSIAN)
Its Ivan

Dom frosts over She turns the music off

DOM (IN RUSSIAN)
Say your hello and then leave

She disappears into the other room as Tati opens the door
allowing a casually dressed Egorov inside a leather folio
under his arm He gives her a hug and kiss

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
Tati how are you You look well

TATI (IN RUSSIAN)
As do you Cousin

Egorov spots the hanging photo smiles

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
This is for your next showing

TATI (IN RUSSIAN)
Yes

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
You are so gifted

Egorov notices Dom return now in clothes He smiles warmly
at Tati and plucks the cigarette from her hand

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN) (CONTD)
I just wish you would quit smoking
Your sister works too hard to ensure
that you get the best care fora
medical condition that is only
exacerbated by cigarettes

TATI (IN RUSSIAN)
Ill try

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
Good

Tati throws Dom a worried glance and splits

DOM (IN RUSSIAN)
What brings you here on a Sunday

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
A cup of tea would be nice

LATER Dom is sitting at the table poring over files from

the folio while Egorov meanders around the apartment
perusing the pictures of Dom on the wall He stops at a family
photo when Dom and Egorov are in their teens ---

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN) (CONTD)
I miss the family summers at the
lake in Kirzac

He turns to Dom with a subtle carnal look

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN) (CONTD)
Fond memories ---

Dom knows that hes eyeing her but she doesnt look up
EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
Based on what you see how would you
appraise this man Nash

DOM (IN RUSSIAN)
Hes a competent operator whose talent
lies in making us believe he is
incompetent

Egorov nods in agreement and takes a seat next to Dom

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
We have a penetration of the top-
echelon a mega-mole And I suspect
that Nash is the handler

DOM (IN RUSSIAN)
Youre not Counter Intelligence

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
This would be a special project
outside of their purview

DOM (IN RUSSIAN)
So they arent pursuing him

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
They are focusing their attention on
a technical breach (Beat) Rumor has
it Nash has been posted to Athens ---
Id like you to go there and make an
appraisal Patterns pathology
vulnerabilities leverage Can he be
approached Manipulated Is he still
operational with his Moscow asset

Get under his skin

DOM (IN RUSSIAN)
Im an operations officer ---

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
That was also trained as a Sparrow ---

DOM (IN RUSSIAN)

Of course ---

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
The world makes whores of us all
(off her look)
Im only interested in the expedient
result How you choose to get it is
entirely your discretion

DOM (IN RUSSIAN)
You still have confidence in me after
Brussels

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
Absolutely While you werent
successful in converting the target
into an asset the outcome was still
extremely beneficial to us

Egorov packs up the files back into his folio

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN) (CONTD)

hooks into Greek intelligence And

Gable grabs a gym bag out of the trunk slams it shut and
flashes Nate a sheepish grin and shrug

GABLE

A weary Korch sits alone finishing dinner He sees Sokolov
the First Deputy Chief of the GRU from the earlier meeting
carrying a tray looking like a condemned man
Gesturing Sokolov to sit Korch eyes him with concern

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
How goes the hunt

SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)

Im a blind man in a dark room looking
for a black hat that isnt there

(off Korchs look)
Were going through everything
sweeping every trunk line flushing
the system with snares -- and nothing

(leans in grave)
Im beginning to fear we might have
to confront the reality of a mole

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
Any way I can help

SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
Not with this but there is something ---
youve heard of the walk-in in
Istanbul

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
The German engineer I hear the taste
of intel he gave us is impressive

SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
Beyond impressive Unprecedented
But his list of demands before he
discloses anything else is
preposterous They get greedier and
greedier every time

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
Better than a shit-eater volunteering
to help us for free no

Sokolov manages a derisive smile

SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
Kaminsky was supposed to fly there
and vet him but his ulcer is bleeding
again Could you do it

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
I dont know Im overwhelmed right
now too When

SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
It was supposed to be in 10 days
but we can try to work it around
your schedule

Lada limos entering the secure parking --- and heads down
the street to a nondescript KGB administrative building

INT CORRIDOR - KGB ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING - MINUTES LATER

Carrying a large pastry box in hand Egorov heads down a
basement hall to a secure door He types in a code to the
keypad lock --- the door buzzes open and he enters

INT EGOROVS COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS

The mole hunt command center is a large open room cluttered
with desks file cabinets and cots The walls are covered
with various investigative matrixes link diagrams etc One
wall is dedicated to the eight remaining suspects with their
photo at the top of a long column of key biographical data

Egorovs 2nd in command LIEUTENANT BORIS KOSOLOV directs a
team of FIVE WEARY YOUNG ANALYSTS evaluating reams of data

Giving the pastries to his team Egorov looks to Kosolov

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
So --- Nicoleyevsky

KOSOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
No

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
But he held so much promise Motive
access the hubris

KOSOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
But not the opportunity We finished
reconciling his movements with the
timeline --- too many discrepancies
Its not him Im sorry

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
Dont be Elimination is still
progress Take him off the board

Kosolov nods to one of the Analysts nearby

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN) (CONTD)

computertelex terminal with a flashing indicator He takes
a key from around his neck inserts it and turns Types ina
command The printer starts chugging out a message

Ripping it off the printer Egorov sits at his immaculate
desk and after reading it carefully makes some notes He
waves the waiting Kosolov into his office

KOSOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
Word from Athens

Egorov slides him the Telex printout Kosolov reads it

KOSOLOV (IN RUSSIAN) (CONTD)
The collected poems of Pavel Markova
And in Russian no less Interesting
(off Egorovs look)
His volumes are impossible to find
in Moscow Most were purged

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
Thats hardly the meat of it ---
(snatches telex back)
But the fact that Nash is focusing
on these useful idiots November 17
could be advantageous

KOSOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
How so

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
If she is unable to get what we need
her way this gives us the cover for
another option

Surprised Kosolov throws him a grave look are you serious

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN) (CONTD)
A deadly disease sometimes requires
a dangerous remedy (Beat) But itll
never come to that

KOSOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
Youre putting a lot of faith in
her Why

Egorov stares into the burning light bulb on his lamp After
a long unwholesome beat --

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
Because I truly understand what shes
capable of

wont stay open Feeling just inside Nate finds and flicks
on a light switch illuminating a single bulb -- but the
switch is broken and wont stay on unless held

smile --- she holds his gaze without returning the smile

beat nods Elena smiles stunned and impressed

ELENA (CONTD)

You know I wasnt pressed into

in the Marxist ideal Ive always
believed in the cause despite feeling
that the cause never truly believed

puts his bucket hat on her She thanks him with a look

They spot the silhouettes of PEOPLE on top of the rock
standing up waving at them

As they finally come around the rock Tryphosa is revealed
A natural horseshoe-shaped harbor framing a perfect beach

Abutting one end of the beach the massive rock face is
honeycombed by a matrix caves converted into into hippie
dwellings squatters emerging from them like a motel

Behind the beach is a tiny village of flagstone streets and
white-washed minimal houses nestled along the slopes

Bordering the other side of the beach is another taller

white rock formation On top of it are TEMPLE RUINS At the
base of this formation is a natural quay and a plane of smooth
rock jutting into the water with SUNBATHERS laying on it

He presses down hard on the ON switch sending the burst
transmission then switches the radio on --- he futzes with
it while looking at a green indicator --- after a few seconds

YOUNG HIPPIES performing a ritual while lighting the bonfire

Its a dream temple a sanctuary for
those seeking healing a relief from
a pain of the soul The ancient Greeks
called it an Asclepieion

people using a dream therapy

Dom heads up into the village Nate following

EXT STREET - VILLAGE OF TRYPHOSA - MINUTE LATER

Nate and Dom wind up towards their villa Behind them are
the moonlit ruins atop the rock

The ritual began with 2 days of
purifying sweat chambers and baths ---
after which the priests would massage
sacred oils into your body --
preparing you for your entry into
the dream incubation chamber ---

NATE
(repeats it dreamily)
Dream incubation chamber Far out

DOM

Once in the chamber you would be
lulled into a deep sleep by soft
chanting -- and it is in your dreams
that your soul would be cured of its
woes The priests would interpret
your dream and extract its divine
prescription for how to live your
life -- and if you followed it you
would be made whole again

NATE
We should climb up there check it

EXT FARMERS MARKET - TRYPHOSA - LATER

Nate and Dom peruse the farmers market tasting produce

EXT VERANDA - PRIMITIVE VILLA - TRYPHOSA - DUSK

Dom watches from the veranda as Nate expertly chops tomatoes
and cooks squid over a propane flame inside MUSIC and VOICES
from the beach emanate in the background

Nate finishes assembling the plates He walks them out to
the veranda and places them on the candle-lit table

DOM
This is beautiful thank you

Nate sees shes surprised and impressed by the dishes

NATE

My grandparents

(off her look)
Thats who taught me about food how
to cook I was raised by them My
grandfather was a produce wholesaler
my grandmother was always in the
kitchen It was through cooking that
she expressed her love ---

(cuts a little grin)

She giggles uncharacteristically easy

It must have been wonderful to be
loved like that

compensate for the fact that my mom
And my father well

DOM (CONTD)
I only have the vaguest memory of
him I lost my mother at 17 which
is when I had to stop dancing ---
(stops herself)
You know what lets not do this
Share our sad stories ---

Nate nods in agreement --- waits for her to take a bite and
enjoys watching her savor the food

LATER Dom finishes clearing the last plate Tension smoldering
inside her She turns around Nate is in the doorway staring
at her Both feeling something visceral both nervous about

it To cut the tension Nate smirks ---

NATE
Fuck me if Im wrong but dinosaurs
still exist right

She takes a step towards him vulnerable --- whispers ---

DOM
Stop it

He steps close enough to kiss her -- hovering -- until neither
can take it -- they kiss Quickly turning hungry consuming
Dom comes alive in ways we only saw when she was dancing

He lifts her her legs straddling around him She yanks his
shirt off as he carries her into the BEDROOM lays her on
the bed Dropping his pants he TEARS her dress off

As he feasts on Dom --- her lips her neck her breasts ---
his hand slides between her legs and begins to get her off

Her body contorts as the ecstatic pressure builds until
shes gasping quaking losing her mind in a cataclysmic
orgasm -- perhaps her first ever with another man

Fueled by her pleasure he positions himself between her
legs but looking down at her he stops --

Her gasps have given way to restrained barely-audible sobs
tears streaking a face so fragile it may shatter He looks
at her like a wounded little girl and she closes up trembling ---

She weeps uncontrollably as she starts pulling away but
Nate wont let her Intuitively understanding he cradles
her whispering into her ear though we cant hear his words

We HEAR Music Eric Saties Gnossiennes No 1 --- and
strange sounds electronic hiss audio distortion --- heavy
breathing grunts --- carrying us into

INT EGOROVS APARTMENT - MOSCOW - NIGHT

Bathed in the flickering light of a TV Egorov sits on his
couch staring with disturbing intensity directly at us
Sipping vodka Satie record playing on console behind him

Distorted voices emanate from the TV a BRITISH MAN and a
WOMAN speaking French-accented English --

WOMAN (0OS VIDEO)
Youre nothing --- say it

ARCING AROUND THE EDGE OF THE ROOM --- slowly revealing the
TV SCREEN hooked up to a primitive VCR ---

After a few pained ecstatic GRUNTS the man replies ---

BRITISH MAN (0S VIDEO)
Im nothing

We can finally make out the video -- dark grainy surveillance
footage -- a bedroom -- the man on all fours while the woman
kneels behind him pegging him in the ass with a strap-on --

WOMAN (VIDEO)
And what am I

After a few rugged thrusts we catch a quick glimpse of the
woman as she glances towards the camera -- its Dom --

BRITISH MAN (VIDEO)
Everything

A sudden KNOCK on Egorovs door Surprised he gets up shuts
off the tv and music He opens his front door revealing his
right-hand man Kosolov --- Egorov lets him in

BENFORD
How do you know he didnt send this
with a Line KR gun to his head

NATE
Because what I know is something a
craven motherfucker like you will
never understand ---

If they had a gun to his head he
woulda made them pull the trigger
before setting me up

BENFORD

All right well spend the night at

INT OBSERVATION POST - APARTMENT - EXARCHEIA - NIGHT

The pouring rain and occasional thunder continues Elena is
resting on an old couch Dom is staring out the window at
Nates darkened apartment

ELENA
I cant remember the last time there
was a summer storm like this in Athens ---

DOM
I find it comforting --- as though
there are moments when even mother
nature cant handle the pressure --

Elena looks at Dom can see there is a lot on her mind

ELENA
Its been 11 hours since you got
back -- where is he What is he doing

DOM
Hes probably still debriefing his
superiors -- dealing with the
consequences of letting Luka go --

ELENA
Hard not to admire what he did ---
(after a long beat)
Does it make it harder for you
knowing that hes a decent man

DOM
Just like our eyes our hearts have
a way of adjusting to the darkness

ELENA
I hope for your sake that his act of
conscience doesnt cause his superiors
to send him back to America ---

Dom nods --- but we can see in her eyes that perhaps she
hopes that they do

DOM
I1l1 know when I see him tomorrow
night

coolly in front of the desk as the Defense Minister paces
back and forth like an angry bull

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
What did you think was going to happen
when we started this
DEFENSE MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)
You started this ---

EGOROV
And you empowered me ---

DEFENSE MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)
I never authorized you to conduct a
search of General Vladimir Korchnois
home

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
Its him Im certain of it

DEFENSE MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)
And youre basing this on what a
book of poetry Korchnoi has
dedicated his life to the service of
this country One of our great heroes --
and the staunchest of hardliners

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
Yes And what better cover could a
traitor have

DEFENSE MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)
Ive known this man for over 40 years ---

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
Then youre aware of the tragedy
that befell his wife

DEFENSE MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)
Of course

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
Let me ask you --- if your wife was
deathly ill during your posting in
London and all you had to do was
walk her down the street to a hospital
to receive life-saving treatment ---

DEFENSE MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)
I know what happened ---

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
He had to watch her die because
Kruschev felt it would be too
embarrassing if her life were saved
by a treatment developed in the west

DEFENSE MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)
Weve all had to make terrible
sacrifices for this country Except
perhaps you

(MORE)

DEFENSE MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN) (CONTD)

(hard look)
You will not turn this mans
heartbreak into your smoking gun

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
Did you see the daily brief out of
Greece this morning Benford is in
Athens As is Nash

So what

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
Korchnoi is traveling right now Id
like to know where and why

DEFENSE MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)
Were done with this conversation

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
With all due respect I believe your
friendship with him is clouding your
judgment

DEFENSE MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)

And I believe your lust for power is
clouding yours This is Vladimir

Korchnoi you insolent little prick ---

and you bring me this circumstantial
shit Unless you have overwhelming
incontrovertible proof I dont want

to ever hear you utter his name again

The Defense Minister storms out leaving the unflappable

Pretending to be drunk Korch lumbers to a credenza opens
another bottle of vodka He surreptitiously takes out a tiny
vial of clear liquid -- as he pours four shots he stealthily
mixes in doses from the vial into three of the glasses

Korch pockets the vial just as Volontov staggers over leans
in and gestures to the Hookers

VOLONTOV (IN RUSSIAN)
Does the General have a preference
for the evening

Korch hands Volontov one of the spiked glasses and takes the
clean one for himself --- and raises it for a toast

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)

RUBANOV (IN RUSSIAN)
Your perverse attempt at a joke

Egorov answers with his eyes Rubanovs baffled and incensed

The toddler giggles and babbles as he plays with his toy
Smiling Egorov picks the boy up begins to bounce him on
his knee -- speaking to him in a overly sweet tone

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
Viktor such a beautiful boy -- your
grandfather loves you dearly -- yes --
as he does all beautiful boys --
boys not much older than yourself
When you become a man what will you
think when you see the photos of
your grandfather viciously sodomizing
these children -- robbing them of
their youth their dignity their
lives Will you still love him

Rubanovs horrified as Egorov hands the boy over to him

He glimpses a reflection in a cracked mirror and flinches --
he sees himself -- and behind him Korch Nate spins around
Glad to see each other they smile

Nate steps in for a hug but Korch holds him off

NATE
I didnt know they were putting a
Keyhole above Vorkuta The fuckers
kept it from me ‘cause they knew Id
tip you

KORCHNOIL
I know

NATE
How bad was the blowback

KORCHNOI
Most are convinced it was a technical
breach But there is at least one
element in the Center pursuing the
possibility of a mole ---

NATE
Are you in trouble

KORCHNOIL
You tell me

Korch pulls out a photo -- the code on the back indicating
its the one from Athens that freaked him out He hands it
to Nate who angles his flashlight on a distant surveillance
photo of himself Luka the girls and Dom right after the
bird shit on him everyone laughing

Stunned Nate looks up at Korch
KORCHNOI (CONTD)
Her name is Dominika Egorov -- An
operations officer that was also
trained as a sparrow ---

NATE
Fuck me ---

Korch pulls out a UV scope --- scans Nate head to toe Korch
then snaps off the UV scopes lens exposing the light and

holds it up to Nate --- shirt and shoes glow with flecks of

spy dust confirming the worst

NATE (CONTD)
If you knew she was on me why did
you risk this meet Why didnt you
just send a burst saying Id been
compromised

KORCHNOI
I dont trust the people you work
for I didnt know how they might
use it ---

Nate spinning out under the weight of what it all means ---

KORCHNOI (CONTD)
I need you to walk me through
everything from the beginning

LATER Korch and Nate sit on the windowsill gazing out at

the water Nate wracked with guilt devastation and

KORCHNOI (CONTD)
We all crave intimacy -- we are all
vulnerable to our desires ---

NATE
This wasnt like that -- I mean shit
we never even had sex -- which is

maybe why I didnt see it coming --
(looks at Korch)

It felt like something else --

something intense and mutual --

KORCHNOI
Love

NATE
All I know is it felt true

KORCHNOI
Which is precisely what sparrows are
trained to do Create the illusion
that its real

shame

NATE
This was different

KORCHNOI
You know what goes on in these
schools

NATE
Yeah Ive heard all the crazy stories
about the sex ---

KORCHNOI
Its much more than sex The training
these women receive systematically
makes them incapable of experiencing
any true emotion except perhaps
fear

NATE
The emotions I saw in this girl were
too complex to manufacture ---
nobodys that good of an actress

KORCHNOI
Do you recall the suicide of Francoise
Guillot back in March

NATE
The NATO guy slit his wrists in the
tub ---

KORCHNOI

Im sure he thought it was real as
well As did all of her targets
Shes quite talented this one

Nate looks over at Korch and gets up ---

NATE
Well then thats it --- youre comin
with me Well exfil you right now

KORCHNOI

Out of the question

(off Nates look)
Defecting would take the power out
of everything Ive done If and when
they come I want to look them in
the eyes I want the satisfaction of
knowing they know

NATE
The fuck is that satisfaction worth

Korch doesnt respond Nates so frustrated he looks like he
wants to smash something He takes a breath
NATE (CONTD)
We have a tap on a trunk line linking
the Ministry of Defense with some of
your key research facilities
including Vorkuta If they want a
technical breach I can give this to
you wrapped in a bow Use it to cover
your ass

KORCHNOI
It cant come from me Therell be
too many questions

NATE
Then Ill get it done from our side

KORCHNOI
Knowing the value of that tap I
highly doubt youll be successful
but if you were it might help

Korch checks his watch gets up

KORCHNOI (CONTD)
How much are you going to tell
Benford

NATE
Everything

KORCHNOI
But the consequences ---

NATE
Doesnt matter anymore Im done
with all this shit I want out of

KORCHNOI

Im so glad to hear this --- nothing

could make me happier
Nate looks down struggling not to lose his shit

Planes in the air Benfords sitting in a doomstruck
meditation face like a clenched fist Nates next to him

hunched forward --- boiling down
BENFORD
Why didnt you tell us about this
girl
NATE

Im supposed to tell you guys about
every piece of ass I chase It didnt
feel like she was working me I fucked
up ---

BENFORD
YOU THINK

NATE
Youre the one who started this whole
thing by allowing DCI Bush to put a
keyhole over Vorkuta just so he
could look good for the president ---
might as well have held up a big
fucking neon sign to the Sovs you
have a breach

BENFORD
I did everything I could short of
resigning to stop them ---

NATE
That what you tell yourself so you
can sleep at night

BENFORD
(explodes )
Hey I fucking bleed inside for every
agent we lose

NATE
Then help me figure this out

Benford gets up and paces around

BENFORD
Theyve probably had a team ghosting
you since you first arrived in Greece ---
You missed your date she knows you
havent been home yet (Beat) As
soon as her cousin Egorov knows that
Marble traveled and where our boy
is cooked

NATE
Egorovs still a few steps behind
us We have time to make a move ---

BENFORD
What move

NATE
Counterintelligence is focused on a
technical breach If we can give
them our line tap itll explain
everything and neutralize Egorov

BENFORD
Youre talking about blowing the one
of the most important SIGINT streams
weve got on the Soviets Do you
have any idea of what it took to put
that tap into place And theres no
guarantee if we do blow it that it
will save him

NATE
Hes risked and delivered more than
anyone weve ever run behind the
curtain Almost two decades ---
(locks eyes with Benford)
We gotta try Sy We owe him that

BENFORD
(after a beat)
Ill do everything I can to convince
the 7th floor barons ---

NATE
Fuck everything you can that was
yesterday Today its gotta be
whatever it takes

BENFORD
I need time to put all of this into
play You need to see her again ---

NATE
Not a good idea

BENFORD
If you dont sell her on some

plausible explanation for where youve

been none of this will work ---

Korch climbs down the fire-escape opens the window and slips
inside Moving quickly to the unconscious Volontov and
hookers Korch strips their clothing and scatters it around

Laying a naked Hooker on the bed Korch arranges the sheets
and pillows to make the bed looked soiled sexed in

Korch lays Volontov on the couch An inspired thought --- he
drapes the hooker on top of him 69-style so his old friend
will wake to a vagina in his face After admiring his handy-
work Korch grabs a vodka bottle and returns to the bed

Stripping himself Korch pours booze on his face and chest
and gets into bed After a deep breath closes his eyes

and establish an emotional dependence

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
When did you return

DOM (IN RUSSIAN)
Monday morning

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
Can you account for his whereabouts
since then

DOM (IN RUSSIAN)

candidate and hes been in Turkey
for the last 48 hours

Dom registers where Egorov is heading

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN) (CONTD)
When were you last with our friend

Dom sits with it for a moment After a beat of struggling
with herself ---

DOM (IN RUSSIAN)

same He accepts this with a calm fatalistic resolve

INT TAVERNA - PLAKA - NIGHT

Nate is sweating balls uptight Dom steps through the door ---
shes stunning When she sees Nate she smiles inwardly
Happiness She takes a deep breath to calm down

When he sees her he subtly girds himself As she arrives at
the table he smoothly gets up pulls out the chair for her
Its rather unlike him and she clocks it

Before he even says a word she reads his body language His
arms are crossed eyes not meeting hers Restless fingers

NATE
Its good to see you Im sorry again
for last night

DOM
Its okay you tried to call I wasnt
there And I enjoyed the movie anyway

NATE
(takes a drink)
Well I felt really bad Ive just
been dealing with the fallout from
some stuff Been a rough couple of

days
DOM
Is everything all right
NATE
(drinks looks away)
I did something --- it was the right
thing to do --- but now Im paying
the price for it
DOM
Can I help
NATE
I just --- I wanna be with you

Under the table he slides his hand onto her thigh and up
her skirt As smooth as it is she sees the aggressiveness
in his eyes

NATE (CONTD)
Theres a hotel down the street
Cmon lets get a room

Before she knows whats happening he drops money on the
table gets up and reaches out for her hand Shes trying
to read him Sensing somethings off she still takes it

INT HOTEL ROOM - PLAKA - LITTLE LATER

A bedside lamp dimly illuminates a small hotel room with a
view of the Acropolis An armoire with large mirrors inlaid
into its doors faces the foot of the bed

Dom and Nate enter She takes in the space as Nate locks
the door and she moves to turn off the lamp

NATE (0S)
Leave it on I want to be able to
see you

Nate waits for Dom to come to him so she does They begin
to kiss hungrily until Nate gently but purposefully stops
her -- then sits in the chair next to the bedside table and
stares at her standing before him

NATE (CONTD)
Take off your clothes

While maintaining eye contact with him Dom slowly strips
everything off laying herself bare Nate breaks eye contact
drinks in her body and then looks past it --- gazing at the
reflection of Doms perfect ass in the mirror

Dom looks back at her reflection in the mirror --- and her
eyes find Nates in the glass

NATE (CONTD)
Get on the bed

Dom pulls the covers off the bed and slides onto the sheets
lying on her side facing Nate But he wont look at Dom
only her reflection

NATE (CONTD)
No not like that I want you up on
all fours --

Dom throws Nate a questioning look in the mirror --- but he
gives her nothing -- just waits for her to comply and so
she finally gets up on all fours ass facing the mirror

NATE (CONTD)
Ass up face down

Dom throws an uneasy look at Nate who stays in the mirror

NATE (CONTD)
Do it

She does it --- and Nate stares long and deep into her
reflection -- getting lost in that shit

NATE (CONTD)
Look at yourself in the glass ---

Remaining in position Dom cocks her head back to look at her
reflection

NATE (CONTD)
Look at me looking at you

Dom looks at Nate in the mirror looking at her ass and body
but not her

NATE (CONTD)
Now touch it ---

Dom touches herself but with this command its now clear
to her everything has changed ---

NATE (CONTD)
Let me see you get yourself off ---

Its all in Doms eyes the whole terrible realization -- He
knows -- he knows who and what I am

Dom shuts her eyes and shuts down -- we can see her entire
being go numb her life force deaden -- and even though she
complies to Nates direction its mechanical no feeling or
pleasure to it at all Just nothingness until finally ---

NATE (CONTD)
This is bullshit Youre not even
trying ---
(stands finally looks
directly into her eyes)
Id rather jerk off to a Playboy

And on that note Nate blows out of the hotel room
Dom collapses on the bed and her whole world collapses in on
her Curling up into a fetal position she wraps herself in

a desperate hug -- and weeps like a wounded animal

INT HALLWAY - HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

Nate stands outside the room back to the door hearing Doms
anguished cries --- wallowing in his own devastation until
he finally turns and disappears down the hall

Korchs anger he waves off the officers who leave

SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
Whatever it is it can wait We have
something more important to discuss

Sokolov steps to his credenza pours some vodka hands one
of the glasses to Korch who pours the liquid out in front
of his stunned boss and drops the glass to the floor

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
Why did you want me to go to Istanbul
when you couldve sent others

SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
Your expertise made you the best
man And the operation was a
tremendous success

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
Bullshit It was a ploy to get me
away so they could search my home

SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
What

Korch gets into Sokolovs face

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
36 years weve known each other
fought together bled together If
you suspect that I am a traitor
then have the guts to say it to my
face instead of conspiring with
those cockroaches from the Center

SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
I have no knowledge of any such
activity but the fact that you think
I did ---

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
I dont know what to think All I
know is that they were there

SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
Who

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)

Ivanovich Egorov

Sokolov processes what it all means sits on his couch

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN) (CONTD)
The only way Egorov would be running
a mole hunt is with the backing of
Grenchenko

SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
(nodding)
But that backing was predicated on
the possibility that it was a mole ---
and now we know that it was not
(off Korchnois surprise)
We found the line tap

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
When

SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
Last night the 2nd directorate
followed an American operations
officer to a manhole on Warsaw Blvd
near the Valensky Bridge They
detained him as he attempted to
extract data recorders from a vital
trunk line connecting the ministry
with our Northern research facilities

Korch absorbs the info breaths a sigh of relief but quickly
shifts into feigned rage and frustration

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
Right in the middle of Moscow Right
under our noses

SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
At least its over now and its the
Centers mess not ours ---

KORCHNOI (IN RUSSIAN)
But this Egorov he is our problem

SOKOLOV (IN RUSSIAN)
Yes

INT EGOROVS COMMAND CENTER - DAY

Everyones busy processing information Egorov is sitting in
his office reading a report A KNOCK on the secure door A
TEAM MEMBER steps to the door peers through the peep hole

TEAM MEMBER (IN RUSSIAN)
(alarmed look to Kosolov)
Its Grenchenko

Kosolov gives the guy a nod he opens the secure door The
Defense Minister steps in followed by TEN OF HIS MEN

The Defense Minister marches into Egorovs office Egorov
stands at attention

DEFENSE MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)
Youve heard about the line tap

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
Yes Minister

DEFENSE MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)
I am terminating this operation --
effective immediately

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
Minister please we are so close ---

DEFENSE MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)
I told you what would happen if you
made this attempt and failed

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
Two nights ago Korchnoi was in
Istanbul only a two hour flight
from Nash in Athens ---

DEFENSE MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)
How could you possibly know that
(realizing that Egorov
went around him)
A grave miscalculation

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
Its him Mark my words

DEFENSE MINISTER (IN RUSSIAN)
Mark them yourself

The Defense Minister heads back into the bullpen and nods at
his men who start tearing down and boxing up materials

Egorov watches desperation oozing out of him like sweat

EXTINT NATES APARTMENT - ATHENS - CONTINUOUS

Dom takes off her headphones and steps away from the camera

ELENA
Im sorry things didnt work out ---

Dom doesnt register any emotional reaction
ELENA (CONTD)
What will they do when you return
Will you be all right

Dom drops the French accent for her natural Russian accent

DOM
Ill be fine

ELENA
(after a beat)
Im going to miss you

Dom begins slowly breaking down her equipment as she talks

DOM

We have a name for people like you
at the Center --- agents that are
not conscripted bribed or manipulated
into service -- but are instead
motivated by a misplaced love of
mother Russia a perverse idealism
about Communism We call you govnoed ---
shiteaters --- and have only the
deepest contempt for your kind You
are the lowest of the low Your
behavior is utterly incomprehensible
to us You see the greatest wish of
everyone in the Soviet Union is to be
anywhere but the Soviet Union ---
Mongolia Greenland the surface of
the moon And yet here you are in
this magnificent country where you
can enjoy all the fruits of
civilization -- fresh food at the
market soap that doesnt have lye
in it access to whatever you want
to read or listen to You can have
anything you want and yet what you
want is to risk everything for the
Soviet Union

(locks eyes with Elena)
You and your child deserve more ---
more than us more than George ---
if you dont find a better life
then you are nothing but a shiteater

ELENA
If what youre saying is the truth ---
then how come you dont defect Why
doesnt everyone defect
Dom eyes her sighs deeply and looks out the window

DOM
Because were Russian

EXT FARM - PELOPONNESE COUNTRYSIDE GREECE - NIGHT

A remote farm in the Corinth region Quiet but for the PULSE
OF CRICKETS Headlights moving down a dirt road to the dark
main FARM HOUSE

The car stops in front next to two other vehicles The
DRIVER a young Greek gets out Dom gets out of the back

Dom sees a LOOKOUT with an Ak47 and is spooked Has no idea
what this place is or who these people are

The Driver heads inside Paranoia growing in her eyes Dom
hesitantly follows

INT FARM HOUSE - PELOPONNESE COUNTRYSIDE - MOMENT LATER

Dom walks in sees 5 terrorists kicking it listening to the
news on the radio She immediately recognizes Christos
throttling her anxiety with confusion

Suddenly Egorov steps from the kitchen with a bowl of soup
greets Dom with a heavy nod Shes totally stunned to see
him and deeply concerned clearly had no idea this was coming

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
Ah Youre here Would you like
something to eat drink
(off her head shake)
Come with me

She follows Egorov down a HALL to a steel door guarded by an
armed Terrorist --- Egorov gestures to a peep hole and Dom
looks through it into

A LARGE WINDOWLESS ROOM WALLS COVERED IN BLANKETS Nate
still hooded in his underwear sitting in a metal armchair
bolted to the floor Arms legs and chest secured with leather
restraints A video camera on a tripod aimed at him

Dom tries to restrain her shock and dismay

DOM (IN RUSSIAN)
What have you done

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)
I have done nothing I am not here
(MORE )

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN) (CONTD)
It is our comrades with November 17
who procured him and will claim
responsibility
Egorov nods at the guard who unlocks the door

INT BEDROOM - FARM HOUSE - PELOPONNESE - CONTINUOUS

Dom and Egorov enter the guard closes locks the door Dom
stands frozen as Egorov removes Nates hood Face swollen
crusted in blood Nate squints trying to get oriented

Getting his bearings Nate sees Egorov then sees Dom ---
Nate and Dom are trying to not betray any emotion

Egorov motions for Dom to sit in the chair against the wall
behind the camera

EGOROV
Your last name Nash --- you of course
know what it means in Russian

NATE
Ours

EGOROV

Yes But it has another meaning
specific to the Kontora When we say
someone is a nash it means he is
one of ours An agent of ours The
irony is thick yes

(off Nates silence)
I am Lieutenant Colonel Ivanovich
Egorov I am very please to finally
meet you

A large suitcase rests on a card table Egorov opens it
reaches under the clothes pulls up a secret flap to expose
an array of medical equipment He carefully removes and
arranges each item on the table

Egorov straps a blood pressure monitor around Nates arm
pumps it up takes his pressure and pulse

EGOROV (CONTD)
Department 12 of S Directorate has
come a long way from the prehistoric
days of intravenous ethanol sodium
thiopental scopolamine The problem
with potent short and intermediate-
acting hypnotics has always been
reliability --- yes

Egorov moves back to the table picks up an INJECTION GUN and
affixes a needle to it Grabs an ampule of clear liquid

EGOROV (CONTD)
Although they encourage talkativeness
it is next to impossible to discern
the fact from the fiction ina
subjects blabberings

Moving back to Nate he holds up the ampule for him to see

EGOROV (CONTD)
This is what makes SP-117 so special

Egorov snaps the ampule into the gun Nate goes nuts trying
to bust free straining so hard his nose starts bleeding
Egorov waits for Nate to give up then jams the needle into
his neck injects the liquid and stands back

EGOROV (CONTD)

Dont worry it wont put you into a
twilight Youll be completely lucid
but your imagination is inhibited ---
like a zoom on a camera lens SP-117
forces the subject to focus on only
that which they believe to be true
Interestingly enough it barely has
an effect on women --- something to
do with hormones

(hard glance at Dom)
But were working on this

After glancing at his watch Egorov puts the gun down returns
with a retinascope and checks Nates eyes The drug is already
starting to work --- Nate is trying to breath through it

Egorov turns on the video camera waits patiently for a bit

EGOROV (CONTD)
Mister Nash Id like to start by
having you answer a simple question
(beat) What is the color of the
falling snow

Nate is breathing hard trying to fight the drug
EGOROV (CONTD)
Answer the question (beat) What is

the color of the falling snow

NATE
Red

Nate suddenly starts laughing but is still fighting
EGOROV

What is the color of the falling
snow

NATE

Egorov checks his watch again waits a beat Observes the
drug taking over Nate becoming tranquil

EGOROV

NATE
I told Korchnoi we would blow it to
give him cover

EGOROV
And theres been no further contact
with Korchnoi subsequent to Istanbul

NATE
No

Egorov breaks into a big inward smile He shuts off the
camera pulls the tape --- which he slides into his bag
alongside FOUR OTHER TAPES

Egorov snaps another ampule into the injection gun and shoots
Nate up --- his body surges alive like shocked with
electricity --- gasping for breath --- hyperawake Nates
looking at Egorov like What the fuck just happened

Egorov packs his equipment zips his bag carries it to Nate

EGOROV (IN RUSSIAN)

cooperation Ill be sure to give

As the flames grow Dom aims on the door waiting --- the
door swings open and she BLOWS THE LOOKOUT AWAY

She stands breathing close to overloading Getting it
together shes about to fire a kill shot into Egorov when a
bloodied Christos sweeps her legs --- she slams down onto a
coffee table which collapses ---

Christos is immediately on her pummeling her -- blood gushing
from his thigh and shoulder wounds as he starts chocking
her She tries to push him off with one hand -- flails her

other hand out desperately trying to grab whatever she can --
Dom clasps a pen JAMS it into the bullet hole in Christoss
thigh --- as he recoils in agony she grabs the back of his
head pulls him in tight to her face and drives the bloody
pen straight into his ear as deep as she can ---

DOM
Midnight tomorrow In Meteora

NATE
Cant believe youre going back
(beat) I dont know how youre gonna
get through this

DOM
Imagining you imagining me --- this
is how I will survive

They kiss passionately slowly removing each others clothes
and begin to make love

DISSOLVE TO

EXT BEACHFRONT SAFE HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

Nate ushers Dom to the back of a UTILITY VAN with FOUR CIA
AGENTS dressed like average Greeks waiting inside

Shes about to say something to him but her eyes take over
and tell him what her voice cant Nate leans in close and
whispers something into her ear

They give each other a delicate kiss and hug for last time
Dom gets into the van As it drives off through the gates
Nate gets into a car with Gable and Benford Gable tears
out heading in the opposite direction

INT KORCHNOIS APARTMENT - MOSCOW - NIGHT

Dressed casually a drunk Korch sits smoking and finishing a
glass of Old Rip Van Winkle He stubs the cig out staggers
up revealing a glimpse of a belly-holstered pistol

Korch empties the rest of the bottle into his glass takes
out a record puts it on his turntable drops the needle and
turns it up full blast

As the orchestral intro of Lee Hazlewoods Sundown Sundown
kicks in Korch conducts with his hands

EXT METEORA - GREECE - NIGHT

THE MUSIC CONTINUING OVER --- HIGH ANGLE OVER AN EPIC PANORAMA
OF METEORA a majestic forested mountain valley dotted with
titanic sandstone buttes jutting thousands of feet high A
two-lane highway snakes through the area

CLOSE ON DOM on the forest floor hidden in a thicket of
trees just off the road eyeing the highway waiting

PULL BACK TO

EXT MOUNTAINSIDE OVERWATCH - METEORA - CONTINUOUS

Nate Gable and Benford nestled on a mountainside looking
down at Doms position through binoculars

INT KORCHNOIS APARTMENT - MOSCOW - SAME TIME

Korch in his chair singing along with total abandon

EXT MOUNTAINSIDE OVERWATCH - METEORA - SAME TIME

THE MUSIC CONTINUES Benford can see Nates anxiety

NATE
Theyre gonna put her on the box
sweat her on every detail

BENFORD
She can handle it

NATE
What if they dont buy it

GABLE
Whats not to buy She delivered
Korchnoi to them on a silver platter

BENFORD
Were making a big deal out of this
The rest of the worlds gonna think

top female ops officer

GABLE
Its a fuckin public relations
bonanza for The Kremlin

(MORE )
GABLE (CONTD)
Theyre gonna turn her into the
superhero of every little girl and
the wet dream of every little boy
Shell be bulletproof the Centers
new star

Suddenly a set of headlights approaching from a couple miles
away at the end of the valley Benford checks his watch

BENFORD
Its them

INT KORCHNOIS APARTMENT - MOSCOW - SAME TIME

Korch guzzles the rest of the Bourbon rocking to the song ---

THROUGH THE WINDOW BEHIND HIM on the street a phalanx of
black cars pull up A SMALL ARMY OF KGB pile out rush inside

EXT ROADSIDE - METEORA - SAME TIME

MUSIC CONTINUING Through the trees Dom sees the approaching
headlights

EXT MOUNTAINSIDE OVERWATCH - METEORA - CONTINUOUS

MUSIC CONTINUING Nate Gable and Benford watch as the CAR
pulls over kills its lights and waits

EXT ROADSIDE - METEORA - CONTINUOUS

MUSIC CONTINUING Dom cuts through the trees to the side of
the road A MAN is waiting by the cars open back door She
gets in he slams the door shut but instead of hearing it
we hear FISTS POUNDING ON A WOOD DOOR ---

INT KORCHNOIS APARTMENT - MOSCOW - SAME TIME

The door is kicked down --- a HOARD OF KGB AGENTS bust in
followed by Sokolov --- to find Korch standing with a gun
leveled at them The KGB guys draw their guns

Sokolov and Korch lock in a grim devastated gaze
Korch looks like hes about to pull the trigger --- but before
he can the KGB Agents fire --- and Korch is killed ina

blaze of gunfire A teary Sokolov turns off the record player

EXT MOUNTAINSIDE OVERWATCH - METEORA - CONTINUOUS

Everything quiet just the wind Nate Gable and Benford
watch the car pull away and head down the road

NATE
Hes gone ---

GABLE

You dont know that ---
NATE

I know him
BENFORD

If Korchnoi ended it on his own terms
it was a good death

NATE
Going out while getting blown by Pam
Grier thats a good death not this

The men watch the cars tail lights receding in the distance
Benford sees Nates all broken up

BENFORD
Dont worry youll see her again

NATE
In my dreams ---

BENFORD

Nate studies Benfords face sees that its real ---

BENFORD (CONTD)
We want you to run her from Helsinki

GABLE

Nate looks back out at the car After a beat ---
NATE

The tail lights disappear around a butte
