LUCY
Which makes this difficult because
we considered your grant
application butyour proposal is
not something we can fund at this
time Well because of the economy

TITLE THE WHITE HOUSE - 215 HOURS BEFORE EVERYTHING CHANGES
INT WEST WING - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

WADE SHETTERLY (40s Jason Bateman) faces off against
MIKHAIL YAKOVLEV (50s Saville-Suited Soviet) and his AIDES

WADE
The President signs the Chemical
Weapons Convention treaty in
Helsinki in four weeks I’m not
going in the Oval Office and
telling my boss the biggest push to
limit chemical weapons since the
Cold War is off because of a word

YAKOVLEV

That word is “Varcon” A
theoretical chemical weapon no one
knows how to make Why should we
ban something that does not exist
If we allow this in the treaty it
opens a floodgate to suppress all
manner of intellectual expression

WADE
The foundations for making Varcon
gas were laid out by one of your
scientists in a published paper Is
that the kind of expression we’re
discussing

An AIDE enters and hands Wade a slip of paper

YAKOVLEV WADE
We are not making Varcon gas
You have my word That’s what you said about

your work on Anthrax back
during the Gorbachev years

YAKOVLEV

You hurt meI came very close to
defecting because of that

(as Wade reads the note)
It is not my fault that the door
man at the American Embassy in
London didn’t speak a lick of
Russian and turned me away

WADE

At least your English has
improvedI need for you to excuse
me for a moment

(stands then)
My President feels very strongly
about chemical weapons even the
highly theoretical ones No Varcon
INT WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING - MOMENTS LATER

Busy Bustling with STAFFERS FLATSCREENS show feeds form all
the news channels Wade STEPS OUT with his Aide

WADE
Did you tell the Deputy Director of
the CIA I’m in the middle of saving
the world from chemical weapons

The Aide indicates ANNA BRIGGS (late 40’s Angela Bassett)
standing dead ahead anxious and unamused Wade winces a
little then steps up Handshakes are exchanged

BRIGGS WADE

Wade
Anna

BRIGGS
I need facetime with Big Bird ASAP

WADE BRIGGS
Talk to the Chief of Staff
He’s waist-deep in the
Indonesian crisis wants you
to advise before going to the
President

WADE
I am national security advisor

BRIGGS
I don’t have time for jokes Signal
intelligence picked up a high-
energy transmission we don’t know
where it’s coming from

WADE
What kind of transmission

BRIGGS
Unidentified We picked up three
pulses over three parts of the
country Someone’s sending a highly-
focused high-energy signal - and
it’s getting stronger

WADE
Where are they

Briggs hands over three SATELLITE IMAGES

BRIGGS
One pulse appeared over LA two
hours ago one over Atlantaand
the third one’s right above us

Wade looks at the pictures the White House with an ODDLY
COLORED MAELSTROM ABOVE THE WEST WING

Wade grabs a Sharpie off a desk and heads for one of the
Lucite dividing walls and WRITES something quickly revealed
as a complicated mathematical equation -

You need to let me out of here You
need to let me talk to POTUS

BRIGGS
You need to unpack this for us
What’s the message What’s coming

SMASH CUT TO BLACK

TITLE CIA HEADQUARTERS LANGLEY VIRGINIA - TWENTY ONE HOURS
BEFORE EVERYTHING CHANGES

RESUME ON WADE

WADE
The equation is the message a call
to action it has to be solved

BRIGGS
You sound like a crazy person

WADE
No I don’t There were two other
pulses that means two other people
must be going through the same
thing We need to -

BRIGGS
You need to tell me if you had
anything to do with this if it’s
some kind of a first strike

WADE
First strike Of what

BRIGGS
You tell me
(off Wade’s dubious look)
If there’s a one percent change
that this is a hostile action I
have to treat it with a hundred
percent resolve -

WADE
Your reverence for Dick Cheney is
truly becoming a liability
BRIGGS
The President’s a mile under the
Earth’s crust the VP’s circling in
perpetuity in Air Force Two and
you’re gonna spend years in a lab
with electrodes for boxers This so-
called message came to you in the
form of an incursion into the White
House that makes you a hostile
until I know for sure you’re not

WADE BRIGGS
If the tables were turned -
- it’d be you giving that
speech

As Wade turns away all too aware of his plight Briggs’
second AGENT PRYCE (30s) steps into the room

PRYCE
Agent Briggs there’s something we
need you to see

INT CIA FIELD OFFICE - LOS ANGELES - DAY

Lucy puts down equations like a math prodigy - which she
isn’t A pair of AGENTS try to interrogate her

AGENT1
Miss Bennett we really need to get
some answers from you

LUCY
You people don’t get it I’m doing
math I hate math The only way I
got through undergrad was dating a
math major and all of the sudden I
have a photographic math memory -

AGENT1
If you could stop writing -

LUCY
This message is in my head I need
to get it out OK I’1l tell you all
about my job and my long-distance
boyfriend and my cute loft in the
flower district when I Am Done

Frustrated Agent1 looks up at a SECURITY CAMERA

PRYCE
We just picked her up in Los
Angeles she’s doing the same thing
as the subjects in DC and Atlanta

BRIGGS
They are all writing the same
thing Is it gibberish

PRYCE

We just don’t know it’s too early -
BRIGGS

Not good enough Pryce I need

answers

Briggs turns to a group of DJ QUALLESMASI OKA MATH WONKS
hovering over flatscreens showing close-ups of the equations

BRIGGS (CONTD)
Youre the MITBerkeleyCarnegie
Mellon mathletes show me my tax
dollars at work
(off cowed looks)

For god’s sake - try to put
together a thought

CALVIN (ON SCREEN)
It’s incomplete you gibbons

Briggs TURNS TO LOOK at Calvin’s monitor where he berates
the agents trying to interrogate him

CALVIN (CONTD)
Incomplete There’s two more parts
to the message - they aren’t here

(indicating the board)
You know how 2226 What I have
is “2 - it’s only a third of
this equation Which means A I’m
having a perverse brainfart
straight out of A Beautiful Mind
which I’m not B I’m going to be
hit again by a beam of light from
space or C Two other people got
the pulse and I need to talk to
them to solve thisdid other
people get hit

(off blank looks)
Did Other People Get Hit

The Agent in the room looks up at the camera Calvin notices
and takes it for a tell

CALVIN (CONT’D)
Nice poker face Step aside let me
talk to your supervisor

Calvin ADDRESSES THE SECURITY CAMERA - triggering an INTERCUT
with Briggs who watches intently

CALVIN (CONTD)

OK Big shot You don’t know it
but I own your ass I can solve
this equation if you give the me
missing pieces The only other
person who maybe could do it died
after the Manhattan project

(then)
I want the rest of the message I
want to meet anybody else who got
hit by the pulse I also want a big
room with a lot of white boards
and some brain food A steak From
Ruth’s Chris With the crusty blue
cheese topping and a tub of
Bernaise the size of my head

BRIGGS LUCY
You’re not under arrest
So what am I

BRIGGS

LUCY
I wrote down the equation I can’t
solve it Why was I brought here

WADE
Lucy I work at the White House I
got hit by the pulse tooand
were kind of in unknown territory
You and I are here because the
other person who got hit wants to
meet us

LUCY BRIGGS
I just want to go home
That’s not an option

Build a fusion reactor that will
provide the world clean plentiful
energy end the planet’s dependency
on foreign oil and keep you from
going to warI don’t know that
any of your scientists can do that
Unless you know something we don’t

And cause your murder by every oil
company on Earth

history It will be a global
effort Every nation will have to
come together under a common goal
and contribute money material and
Manpower You will help us convince
the world to get behind the plan

And you really think we’d consider
any of this without further proof

VICTOR
We didn’t make any assumptions We
chose to come on a day we could
predict an event something we
couldn’t cause and you couldn’t
predict In four hours and thirteen
minutes an earthquake originating
at 331221 latitude 1380263
longitude at a depth of 1845 miles
will strike Japan The majority of
the casualties take place in the
Shibuya district

(MORE )

VICTOR (CONTD)
The Kentaro-Kato building will
collapse causing an explosion
because of a faulty gas valve
Three hundred people will die If
that building is evacuated in time
and the gas main repaired the
casualties should be minimal

INT MILITARY INSTALLATION - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Briggs BURSTS through the conference room door pissed
followed by Calvin Wade Lucy and the Colonel

LUCY
So what happens now Do you call
the President The Japanese

BRIGGS
What happens is a team of forensic
analysts scours the crater and
examines the Travelers to make sure
we aren’t being scammed

CALVIN
You just witnessed one of the
greatest events in history

BRIGGS
Oh sure a rainbow coalition of
future people beamed down to save
us from foreign oil This could be
a ploy to destabilize the country

WADE
You could just as easily accomplish
that with a truckful of fertilizer
and a tank of ammonia

BRIGGS
Duly noted You saw the light show
and met the Travelers Now I want
you out of the mix

WADE CALVIN
I’m a cabinet-level officer
in the US Government Briggs And I’m not going anywhere
you don’t get rid of me They asked me here They want

me to work with them

LUCY
What about Japan

WADE
If there’s a one percent chance we
can save those people we have to
get the information to the proper
authorities

BRIGGS
And start an international panic

WADE
It’s not our choice We have to
report to the President Let’s
report Let his conscience guide
him

LUCY CALVIN
I voted for him
Yeah democracy trust the
ordinary lumpen voter

The conversation ends as Soldier 1 ENTERS

SOLDIER 1
The Travelers would like a word
with Mister Shetterlyand
apparently they’re hungry

INT MILITARY INSTALLATION - CANTEEN - MOMENTS LATER

A bunch of bananas sits on a table surrounded by the curious
Travelers Max rolls a banana in his fingers it breaks into
three equal lengthwise pieces

MAX
See that Portable and modular

SACHI
They’re so yellow

WADE (0OS)
They taste pretty good too

The Travelers see Wade entering past two SOLDIERS The
moment The Travelers see him they stand - at attention

MAX WADE
Sorry Mr Shetterly
Call me Wade

VICTOR
We’ve never seen bananas

NAM-JUN
The crops were decimated by black
fungus a century before we born

WADE
Wait ‘til you get a load of kiwi

The Travelers CHUCKLE seemingly nervous and ill at ease

SACHI
You’1l have to forgive us if we’re
a little starstruck We trained for
this We prepared ourselves but
there’s nothing like the real deal

MAX
It’s kind of like that episode of
Star Trek with Lincoln

Wade has no idea what to make of that so he doesn’t

WADE SACHI

Star Trek and Power Point (a smile)

Max turns

We’re time travelers not
aliens

WADE
Lincoln Must have missed that one

back to his bananas as Victor WALKS WADE ASIDE

VICTOR
You have questions you’re too
polite to ask Let me break the
ice There’s something you can
acquire for us something crucial

WADE
I want cheap energy as much as the
next guy but I don’t work for you

VICTOR
I know but I have a feeling you
will Most people would stay away
from the challenge of uniting the
world and building something
completely impossible in a year
but you’re not that person

WADE VICTOR

Did you just say one year

Weve already changed the
future by coming but there
are plans for an emissary
from the new 2299 to come in
a year to report on our
progress I can’t say more

WADE
It sounds so reckless Changing the
future lives of billions

VICTOR
You mean the deaths of billions
That has a way of refocusing your
priorities We chose you and Calvin
and Lucy for a reason

(MORE )
VICTOR (CONTD)

We sent our message knowing how
long it’d take to solve and how the
government would respond we came
to Barringer Crater because we knew
youd bring us to this station and
what we need only exists here

(driving it home)
It’s an ampule of Varcon gas It’s
a key part of our fusion ignition
sequence

Wade takes a step back this is way beyond the pale

WADE
Youre decades early Varcon is a
highly theoretical weapon of mass
destruction

VICTOR
Your government is making it in
this base

Wade struggles with this as the other Travelers step up

WADE
It doesn’t exist
VICTOR
The lab’s ten levels below us
(off Wade)
What you do with that knowledge is
up to you
NAM-JUN

It will take heroes to stand
against the tide of history

WADE
If there was such a lab if we
could make Varcon if it could
truly ignite this alleged reactor
of yoursit will take more than
flattery to get me to hand you a
weapon of mass destruction

VICTOR
We would hope so Mister President

Wade stands there STUNNED INTO SILENCE for a moment

WADE
Mister President Excuse me

VICTOR
In our future you’re the most
revered President since Lincoln

NAM-JUN
The last great American The one
who almost stopped the apocalypse

INT MILITARY INSTALLATION - TELECOM HUB - DAY

PRESIDENT DOUGLAS WATSON (a dynamic charmer a year older than
Wade) talks to Briggs and Wade from a flat panel display

WADE
Mister President our satellite
imagery confirms what we saw -

BRIGGS
Our satellite imagery confirms an
event just like it confirms events
over Los Angeles DC and Atlanta

WADE
What skin is it off our nose to
call the Japanese Meteorological
Agency Or the NPA say there’s a
threat on the Kentaro-Kato building
and they should evacuate

BRIGGS WADE
Mister President I strongly (to Briggs)
advise you not to - Why do you want them to be a
fraud
BRIGGS

Why do you need to believe

PRESIDENT WATSON
Settle down people It’s only
hours before we know if this is a
hoax Keep the civilians tucked
somewhere comfortable - as guests
of the United States Government
Well find a way to notify the
Japanese through channelswithout
mentioning time travel

WADE
Thank you Now can we talk Alone

Briggs shakes her head then EXITS The President SOFTENS

PRESIDENT WATSON
Heck of a day Flounder

WADE
Dang skippy Otterand we still
have to talk about the Chemical
Weapons Convention negotiations

PRESIDENT WATSON
Aren’t you dedicated

WADE
Is the Government covertly
manufacturing Varcon Gas

PRESIDENT WATSON
You asking your President or your
friend

WADE
Yes

PRESIDENT WATSON
Piss off and bite me I resent the
implication that I’d send you to
negotiate a treaty I was breaching
behind your back You take your
source to the woodshed and I’11
forget this conversation ever took
place

INT MILITARY INSTALLATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Victor sits Briggs PACES jacket off (and shoulder holster
very much on display) and shirtsleeves rolled up

VICTOR
I don’t know how else to say this
I can’t travel back and forth in
time don’t know how to build
another time machine and don’t have
weapons from the future

BRIGGS
What about your fusion reactor You
don’t even have blueprints

VICTOR
My son was given an implant when he
was a fetus His mind is a human
hard drive Everything he sees is
recorded The plans are in his
head

BRIGGS
You did that to your own son

Victor leans back shoots her an easy smile

VICTOR
When you were a kid did you like
candy bars Milky Way Snickers Or
the weird ones Clark Nut Goodies
Goo-Goo Clusters

Briggs regards Victor then takes a breath and sits in front
of him allowing herself to soften just a bit

BRIGGS
There was a deli where I grew up
they had these hand-made bars
called Zang They were really good

VICTOR
What about toys Were you a Cabbage
Patch Kid girl Nintendo

BRIGGS
I think I understand where you’re
going with this

Victor leans forward showing the resolve of a true leader

VICTOR
I don’t think so I don’t think you
can truly know the hell we came
from I don’t think you can
conceive of life without everything
that ever gave you comfort or joy
I don’t think you can imagine
living with the knowledge that the
human race is becoming extinct You
have no business questioning my
motivations or asking me to give up
my secrets on anything other than
my terms

(as Briggs stands)
I came to share knowledge with the
world not to let anyone take it
for themselves Let your superiors
know that

INT MILITARY INSTALLATION - GUEST QUARTERS - DAY

A GUARD stands watch outside the door visible through a
glass A window lets in the desert sun Lucy lies on a bunk
Calvin writes Wade watches a flatscreen featuring

A SATELLITE IMAGE OF THE KENTARO-KATO BUILDING

CALVIN
Yo satellite boy ever hear “a
watched pot never boils”

WADE
Ever hear “piss off and bite me”

LUCY
What happens when the building
collapsesor doesn’t
(off Wade)
(MORE )

LUCY (CONTD)
I don’t want to be a “guest of the
government” or be stuck in this
room any longer than I have to

CALVIN
You gotta let us talk to the
Travelers we have a future to

change

LUCY
That’s not what I meant I want to
go home

WADE

Would it kill either of you to show
some patience

Silence Wade sighs A beat Then

CALVIN

“The Savage Curtain”

(off Wade’s look)
The Star Trek episode you
mentioned The Excalbians kidnap
Kirk and Spock and create clones of
Lincoln and Surak for the ultimate
good-and-evil grudge match against
Genghis Khan Colonel Green
Kahless and Zora That makes you a
good guy A legendary good guy I
want to know about my futurewho
do I become Why was I chosen

LUCY
Not this “chosen one” crap again

As Calvin speaks Wade steps to the window SEEING SOMETHING

CALVIN
But we were chosen We have some
greater destiny here - you owe it
to us to let us see it through

WADE
What the hell

CALVIN
What is it

EXT MILITARY INSTALLATION - TARMAC - CONTINUOUS

A series of vehicles ENTER the buildingincluding a high-
tech armored truck the size of a Brink’s

WADE
That truck
(going for the door)
Stay here

CALVIN
Do we have a choice

INT MILITARY BASE - MOTOR POOL - MOMENTS LATER
Wade BARRELS toward Colonel LOPEZ as a SOLDIER gives chase

SOLDIER
Sir you do not have clearance -

WADE
Back off What part of “National
Security Advisor” did you miss

COLONEL LOPEZ
Stand down Soldier

WADE
That’s a GW-35 hazardous materials
transport am I right
(off the Colonel’s
silence)
Why is the Varcon being moved

And off the Colonel not about to confirm or deny
INT MILITARY INSTALLATION - GUEST QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER
Lucy PACES watching the building on the display

CALVIN
Stop looking It’s gonna fall

LUCY
Id just as soon it didn’t

CALVIN
What’s your malfunction Someone
offers you greatness and you’re
worried about Skyping your boytoy

LUCY
These people show up tell us we
messed up the world there’s no way
to fix it and we suck and you
think that’s greatness

CALVIN
Greatness is where I get to fix it

LUCY
So you’re ready to just drop
everything for these people What
are we supposed to do Quit our
jobs Stop paying the rent

CALVIN
Wow I’ve just met a person who is
completely devoid of vision

LUCY
This isn’t some nerd dream come
true for me I was helping the
world in my own way - who am I
supposed to be now

CALVIN
Whoever you choose

ON THE DISPLAY - THE KENTARO-KATO BUILDING SHAKES

LUCY
Oh - god

And as the two watchand the building FALLS
RESUME ON WADE AND THE COLONEL

WADE
I asked you a question - why is the
Varcon being moved

COLONEL LOPEZ
Mr Shetterly I cannot confirm or
deny the existence of Varcon gas in
this facility

WADE
I’m on the President’s CWC
renegotiation team You think I
wouldn’t know what’s being
manufactured in experimental
quantities ten levels below us

COLONEL LOPEZ WADE
We are in the middle of a
national security crisis - Because after I talked to the

President you got orders
telling you your operational
security was compromised and
to move the gas Now tell me
what I need to know

COLONEL WADE
We’re moving an asset
What asset What is the
asset Is it Varcon gas or
not just tell me

BRIGGS (0S)
Wade step away from the Colonel

Wade SEES Briggs flanked three Soldiers brandishing AR-15s

WADE
What is this

BRIGGS
There was just an earthquake in
Japan Exactly where and how the
Travelers predicted I’m putting
you and them under arrest and
taking you to Langley for
interrogation

WADE BRIGGS
On who’s authority
The President Wade

WADE
You finally have proof this thing
is real and you put us in chains

BRIGGS
Yes These people know the future
They have the plans for a nuclear
fusion reactor - and you’re part of
it Do you think we can just let
them walk out of here and share
that knowledge with anybody You
and them are going in a hole until
everything they know is in our
control

The Soldiers CUFF Wade then FRISK HIM against a truck

WADE
You are making a terrible mistake

Briggs regards Wade truly regretting this
BRIGGS
You asked why I wanted them to be a
fraud This is why

And off Wade pissed

CUT TO BLACK

END OF ACT TWO

ACT THREE
SMASH IN ON THE TRAVELERS - ESCORTED BY SOLDIERS INTO
INT MILITARY BASE - MOTOR POOL - DAY

Where Wade and Briggs are pitched in heated debate for the
soul of Colonel Lopez

WADE
Colonel Lopez Agent Briggs does
not have operational authority
here she is an Agent of the
Central Intelligence Agency As a
cabinet-level advisor I am
requesting that you order your men
to release us immediately

BRIGGS
I have authority from the Commander
in Chief You are under arrest

The Travelers reach the fray as the soldiers move back to
form a perimeter their guns at the ready

VICTOR
Agent Briggs we are goodwill
ambassadors I’m requesting that
you release us

Nam-Jun’s eyes DART around the perimetersix soldiers
holding them at gunpointthe two men standing by the
Hazardous Materials transport vehicle

BRIGGS
I can’t grant your request

SACHI
We came to offer you technology
that will save this planet

BRIGGS
And my government wants that
technology on our terms and in a
secure location

As Max speaks Nam-Jun looks to Sachi making a subtle hand
gesture - as if giving an order

MAX
You mean someplace like Guantanamo
where you can beat it out of us
instead of letting us give what we
know to anyone who needs it

VICTOR
Max Enough

CALVIN (0S)

This is lower than low Briggs

Calvin and Lucy enter escorted by the Guard

BRIGGS

I will have you gagged

(then to Wade)
This is a question of national

security it’s out of our hands

NAM-JUN
Then I apologize for this

Nam-Jun SPINS landing an OPEN PALM STRIKE to the underbelly
of a Soldier’s rifle sending it into the Soldier’s face

SACHT AND MAX
DO THE SAME to two other soldiers
VICTOR SHOOTS FORWARD

And PULLS the weapon from Briggs’ holster - moving to Colonel
Lopez and doing the same before either has a chance to react

RATATATAT ONE OF THE SOLDIERS REFLEX-SQUEEZES HIS TRIGGER

Victor throws himself back TAKING LUCY TO THE FLOOR
preventing her from being shot

AND THEN IT’S ON
The Travelers move like electrified mercury landing BLOWS

TAKING WEAPONS and SWEEPING OUT LEGS in a display of martial
athleticism that makes Jason Bourne look like Betty Crocker -

- and as the fight moves past like a BURST OF LIGHTNING
CALVIN WADE AND LUCY

Reel - STUNNED -

RATATATATAT MORE MACHINE GUNS FIRE

- as The Travelers divert the barrels from the group with
their martial arts skills - no one is hit -

- smoke fills the roomalong with the MOANS of the fallen
soldiers as the fight ends

with the CLICK-CLICK-CLICKING of AR-15s dismantled with
precision by Nam-Jun and Sachi as Victor grabs a handful of
cable ties and goes to work on binding the soldiers

AS MAX HITS A SERIES OF SWITCHES
And ALL THE GATES TO THE MOTOR POOL TO CLOSE AUTOMATICALLY

MAX
Motor Pool’s secure outer gates
locked MPs on the way - they’ll be
tear gassing in sixty seconds

CALVIN
Holy frack that was badass Yeah
(to Briggs)
Gagme now Briggs

Lucy can barely overcome her shock to BARK OUT

LUCY
SHUT THE HELL UP CALVIN

Wade gets in Victor’s grill

WADE
Is this how you hope to recruit us
by making us part of this attack

VICTOR
By showing you the truth Your
government - your best friend -
lied to you and made you party to
deception on a global scale You
want to stay and be a patsy help

yourself
LUCY WADE
What are you talking about (in Victor’s grill)

If a single man dies because
of this I will call down the
thunder in a way you cannot
conceive -

VICTOR (CONTD)
Id expect nothing less

BRIGGS
You people are insane You are in
the middle of the desert - you just
assaulted eight military officers
a CIA operative a Colonel -

SACHI
Do you have children
(off Briggs’ silence)
By 2299 every fertile woman will be
law-bound to have one to hold back
the inevitable extinction
(MORE)

SACHI (CONTD)
I did my duty then watched my
little girl die of Varcon poisoning
when the ventilation in her school
bunker failed and she was exposed
to outside air We have a mission
We will be no one’s prisoners The
world will know what we know

The sound of ALARMS from outside fills the space

MAX
Thirty seconds and it’s gonna be MP
central around here

VICTOR LUCY
Let’s go
Go where

Max and Nam-Jun move to an ARMORED DOOR on the far side

NAM-JUN
There’s a lab ten levels below us
it has an escape tunnel equipped
with a high speed transport to the
next town

MAX
Twenty-five seconds

SMASH CUT TO THE LOCK ON THE ARMORED DOOR
AS MAX HOLDS UP HIS HAND TO THE ELECTRONIC LOCK

And a KEYBOARD LIGHTS UP ON HIS FOREARM - looking like an
electronic tattoo - RESPONDING TO HIS TOUCH

The electronic lock CHIRPS in response Calvin rushes over

CALVIN
Heart-powered synaptic bio-
processor Limited telepathy based
on brainwave conduction

Sachi looks at Calvin a genuine fondness in her eyes

SACHT
Just like on television

CALVIN SACHI

You saw me on TV
We don’t call it TV anymore -

CALVIN
Extreme Mega Science

The autolocks on the door open with a CLICK-CLICK and the
door opens with a HYDRAULIC HISS

SACHT
No Not on that one

CRASH CRASH CRASH A series of windows on the upper level
of the motor pool ERUPT into shards with the entrance of
multiple INDEPENDENTLY-POWERED TEAR GAS GRENADES

VICTOR
(herding everyone inside)
Let’s go let’s go

Calvin Wade and Lucy enter as the room FLOODS with gas Nam-
Jun SHUTS the door behind them

INT MILITARY INSTALLATION - HIGH TECH HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Calvin Wade and Lucy follow down to another ARMORED DOOR
The autolocks on the entrance CLACK-CLACK shut behind them

LUCY
I need to know what you are talking
about - the truth Wade being a
patsy What are you really up to

Nam-Jun turns to Lucy making her his sole focus before
turning back to a state of high alert

NAM-JUN
Before we get to the escape tunnel
you will see a lab where your armed
forces are manufacturing the weapon
of mass destruction that killed
Sachi’s daughter and millions of
others around the world We will be
taking a sample of the gas to use
as a component in our reactor

LUCY
Were stealing a weapon

VICTOR
Technically we’re borrowing it -
our process doesn’t actually spend
the Varcon It lasts indefinitely

The corridor door OPENS to REVEAL six SOLDIERS brandishing
sidearms but Nam-Jun and Sachi ARE ALREADY THERE

SLAM SLAM SLAM SLAM With four BODY BLOWS the foremost
soldiers are KNOCKED OUT - and then - BLAM BLAM BLAM -
weapons are discharged into the walls and ceiling

-even as the soldiers are DISARMED and used as battering
rams to SLAM the rest of the soldiers into the walls

Lucy turns to Wade - having a very hard time dealing with all
the violence as Victor Max Nam-Jun and Sachi take cable
ties from the soldiers’ beltsand BIND them

CALVIN
Wait a minute - you need a lethal
WMD to achieve nuclear fusion

Before anyone can answer Victor USHERS The Three through the
door and into

INT MILITARY BASE - INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Max turns to the controls on the elevator raising his hand
and TYPING FURIOUSLY on his forearm The elevator responds by
LURCHING with an ECHOING MECHANICAL ROAR DESCENDING

Sachi picks up the thread of Calvin’s question

SACHI
Calvin Do you know how when you
were a kid you watched Carl
Sagan’s Cosmos and you read
Hawking’s A Brief History of Time

CALVIN
It made me want to spread the ideas
of science to the world not just
work in a lab - I say that in

interviews
SACHI CALVIN
You inspired me to do what I (flattered)
do I inspired you
SACHI

(a smile then)
and while I studied I
researched your life - and
discovered that the last thing you
did before your death after you
retired from the public eye was to
create this

Sachi raises her hand and TAPS her own forearm keyboard
A HOLOGRAM-LIKE PROJECTION RISES FROM THE PALM OF HER HAND

-a complicated matrix showing the inner workings of the
fusion reactor Calvin staresawestruck

CALVIN
I invented your fusion reactor

SACHI
All we’re doing is moving your work
ahead a few decades

CALVIN SACHI

And it works
The wars broke out before you

had a chance to build it
Youre looking at the
ignition chamber hydrogen
atoms held in suspension in a
matrix of Varcon

VICTOR
Now would you explain to Lucy and
Wade that this will work that we
aren’t just stealing the Varcon for
personal power but because it’s
the only way to save the world

CALVIN
W - w - wait Can you rewind that

INT MILITARY BASE - MOTOR POOL - CONTINUOUS

High tension High alert MILITARY POLICEMEN untie Briggs
Colonel Lopez and the soldiers - all HACKING and COUGHING
from the tear gas A LEAD MP addresses the Colonel

LEAD MP
Are you injured Sir

COLONEL LOPEZ
I’m fine - I’m fine -

LEAD MP COLONEL LOPEZ

We need medics over here
- and we need to get to the
Varcon lab right now

BRIGGS
Aren’t there security protocols
That lab should be inaccessible -

COLONEL LOPEZ
Not all of the protocols are
active We disabled the final seal
because of the evacuation

A SECOND MP SHOUTS from the armored door
SECOND MP
They changed the passcodesthis
is going to take a while

BRIGGS
Get a freakin’ Howitzer

INT VARCON LAB ANTECHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER

The Gears on a huge VAULT-LIKE DOOR CLICK and ROTATE
mechanized rods MOVEthen a wide SWING OUT to REVEAL The
Travelers and The Three - standing in awe of what they see

VICTOR
Wade here’s proof that your
government is as capable of illegal
weapons manufacture deception and
genocide as anyone

Wade shakes his head ruefully worst fears confirmed

WADE
Otter You incredible bastard

AS THEY ENTER REVERSE TO REVEAL
INT MILITARY INSTALLATION - VARCON LAB - CONTINUOUS

An architecturally fascinating space including a stainless
steel blast furnace (a sealed scientific-grade model used to
destroy chemical weapons)and a glass-walled VAULT holding
several hundred ampules of Varcon gas pill shaped three
inches long one inch in diameter Bright yellow

WADE
It almost feels like it was easy

VICTOR
It was Thanks to you There’s a
final seal that we shouldn’t have
opened If anyone tries to force
their way in the place locks down
and is showered with an otherwise
harmless knockout gas - anyone in
the lab goes unconscious for at
least five hours and the base is
thrown into chaos The final seal
can only be overridden by
Presidential order

WADE
Which is what happened when I asked
the President about the lab How
did you know I’d go to him

Max looks up from showing his hologram to Calvin

MAX
Because he knew you’d do the right
thing He wrote a book about you
(off Wade’s look)
It’s a good book

WADE
Then you know I’m not walking out
of here without destroying the gas
and every hard drive and computer
in the place

Calvin BOUNDS from Max’s side to step up to Wade a man
energized by a vision of the future

CALVIN
Are you kidding You can’t destroy
it The unique molecular structure
of the Varcon molecule makes it the
transport matrix for the unstable -

LUCY CALVIN
What
- it’s gonna work guys The
fusion reactor One ampule
of that stuff is going to
light up the planet

SACHI
Wellthat and the most
complicated machine ever built

Victor steps over to a SECURITY STATION on the wall a fire
extinguisher and axe along with an eye-wash station - then
BREAKS the glass and takes out the axe - handing it to Wade

VICTOR
Max secure the door and initiate
the final seal Sachi Nam-Jun
destroy the Varcon save one

Victor HANDS WADE THE AXE and ushers him toward a large
sleek water-cooled computing device

VICTOR (CONTD)
Mister President Here’s the lab
mainframe - it has all the
processes and logs for the
manufacture of Varcon Be my guest

Wade brings the axe down on the mainframewhich EXPLODES
with a SPECTACULAR CRASH

Nam-Jun and Sachi head for the vault holding the Varcon gas
Nam-Jun taps his own forearm-mounted keyboard holding up his
hand The vault OPENS

and as he and Sachi TOSS THE AMPULES into the furnace
LUCY

You’re just gonna throw it ina
furnace Isn’t it I dunno lethal

NAM-JUN
The blast furnace was designed to
destroy the gas

LUCY
SoOKwhat happens now We take
the thing go in the tunnel and
come out wanted for treason

SACHI
You go in the tunnel and come out a
visionary who will help bring
together the present and the future
in creating something newsomeone
who is listened to by millions
because she’s an ordinary person
who speaks of their languages and
stands for the possibility of
something better

Calvin steps up to Lucy his earnest tone that of a convert

CALVIN
Or stay tell the MPs we forced you
into this They’1ll eventually
realize you weren’t part of it and
send you back to your job

INT MILITARY BASE - ELEVATOR - DAY

Outfitted with BULLETPROOF vests Briggs and Colonel Lopez
stand behind a phalanx of MPs The elevator COMES TO A HALT

IN QUICK CUTS

The MPs RUSH out taking positions on the HALLWAY - the LEAD
MP heads for the VARCON LAB DOOR attaches a field laptop to
the terminal - the SECOND MP holds Colonel Lopez and Briggs
back in the elevator until he gets a clear signal

and the Varcon Lab door SSHHWOMPS open with all the
previously seen pomp and circumstance

INT MILITARY INSTALLATION - VARCON LAB - CONTINUOUS

The MPs storm in cover formation to see the furnace
BLASTINGthe vault EMPTYthe mainframes SHATTEREDfiles
and hard drives BURNING in a steel trash canand the
Travellers and Wade Calvin and Lucy GONE

Briggs looks down at the burning trash can
BRIGGS

Must have shut down the fire
suppression system

And then a SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH as a thin stream of GAS enters
the lab from an overhead nozzle

And then an ALARM as the vault-door SLAMS shut

COLONEL LOPEZ
But not the final seal

The MPs PASS OUT falling to the floor as gas fills the room

BRIGGS COLONEL LOPEZ
Varcon
Nonot Varconbut you can
kiss the next five hours
goodbye

The Colonel’s eyes ROLL TO THE BACK OF HIS HEAD as he
DROPS

and off Briggs the expression on her face making the
transition from “doing my duty” to “now it’s personal” just
as the gas takes effect

NAM-JUN
Do you have steak knives

JACK
Seeing as we serve steak

from a TV

Jack reaches under the counter and produces a knife Nam-Jun
CUTS A THIN BLOODLESS SLIT ACROSS THE UNDERSIDE OF HIS ARM
Two dozen shiny diamonds spill out The COOK looks at this

with growing alarm

JACK (CONTD)
How did you do that

NAM-JUN
It’s a smuggling pouch - made of a
biogenetic stealthmagic trick

Nam-Jun runs his thumb over the slit it SEALS

JACK NAM-JUN
Are those diamonds real
Yes they are

JACK
What are you going to with them

NAM-JUN
Buy your car

Nam-Jun looks over to see Victor and Max in a booth with
Lucy as Calvin and Wade interrogate Sachi at a table

SACHI
Open your mind - we are building a
high-energy induction catalyst -

WADE
I’m more interested in knowing how
were gonna get a car

SACHI
Don’t worry We have a plan

ANGLE ON LUCY - GRILLING VICTOR AND MAX

LUCY
Stop being coy there’s a reason
you picked Carl Sagan and Mister
President but me And don’t say
it’s because I’m a polyglot or I
inspire people or any of that
crapOK not crap but you know

VICTOR
Lucy you are a very important -
LUCY MAX
Stop that -
Stop what
LUCY

The thing where you flatter me then
say nothing Just spill it

(off the looks)
-how bad can it be What am I
Hitler’s mom or something

Victor and Max exchange glances Victor takes a deep breath

VICTOR
In our time you become a savvy
operator in the foreign
servicethen an extremely
influential delegate to the UN
where your language skills and
organizational ability made you a
superstar

LUCY VICTOR

You definitely have the wrong

person

You ultimately become
President of the Security
Council As the world falls
into years of conflict over
resources you advocate for
the expansion of the
peacekeeping force’s mission
manpower and materiel By
the time you are appointed
Secretary General you are
the de-facto leader of a
massive Army

LUCY VICTOR

Secretary General An army

-which you deploy into a
hot zone and command to carry
out what ultimately becomes
the greatest genocide of the
century

EXT JACK’S DINER - MOMENTS LATER

Lucy BURSTS out of the doorshe bends putting her hands on
her knees - but she has nothing left to throw up so she just
stands there pantingshutting her eyes as tears RISE

MAX (0S)
I’m sorry

LUCY
That I’m a genocidaire or that you
told me

MAX
Just sorry

LUCY
Why Why would I do it Come on
didn’t anybody write a book about
me

MAX
Your boyfriend - Josh - you become
engaged in five months

(MORE )

MAX (CONTD)
Nine months later he finds a job
in Los Angeleson the day he
flies out his plane’s shot down by
terrorists on approach to LAX You
witness the disaster the hundreds
of deaths Afterwards you tell
everyone you’re working for peace
but the truth is you want revenge

LUCY
And you came to stop me

MAX

Maybe we already did by telling
you Josh won’t get on that plane
now right

(off her look)
But my dad thought what if you
could channel all that talent
energy you showed after his death
in the service of something great

(then)
I know you won’t believe this but
I do envy you I’ve been preparing
for this mission since before I
could think for myself At least
now you have a choice

What am I gonna do with you
Flounder You destroyed hundreds of
millions in military RandD and forced
my hand in front of the world
were waist-deep in e-mails from
people who want us to release you
Almost every nation on Earth has
offered asylum and the ones who
haven’t want to make them
presidents for life It’s a mess

WADE
You forced my hand

PRESIDENT WATSON
I know you think you “got” me
Truth is I could keep you here and
spend the rest of my administration
denying your existence Lucky for
you I’d like to do a few other
things with my Presidency

(sizing them both up)

Wade did you destroy all the
Varcon gas in that facility

WADE
You think I’d be running around
with it I promise your people
searched the crap out of us

The President and Wade stare at one another for a beat then

PRESIDENT WATSON
Good to know Well thenit’s
settled The government will buy
the United Investments Building and
give it to you as a base of
operations along with your
freedom In exchange you will
build your reactor in the US and
give us the first look at any new
technologies and innovations you
create as a result

WADE
Anything else

PRESIDENT WATSON
I want Agent Briggs as your
government-mandated security
liaison The moment you’re
released every freak out there is
going to want a piece of you I
want someone I trust to keep an eye
on our investmentand it’s not
like she can return to covert work

It’s what it didn’t teach you that
worries me

You may have lived in the future
but now you’re stuck here without a
crystal ball like the rest of us

worth saving

Madame Briggs

BRIGGS
Thank you for flying me out in such
luxury I haven’t been to Houston
in a while

THE NEW YORKER
There’s more where that came from

The Texan motions her toward a chair She doesn’t move

THE TEXAN
We’re honored you would hear our
proposal We’ve decided to take a
very close interest in the
activities of the Travelersand
their plans for free global
alternative energy We thought you
might be interested in doing
intelligence gathering for us

BRIGGS
Are you asking me to resign the
CIA

THE NEW YORKER
Not necessarily We can find a way
to keep our arrangement private

BRIGGS
Private like the oath and the
loyalties I’d be betraying

THE SAUDI
We have loyalties as well
Loyalties that could be extremely
useful to a someone in the
intelligence business All we want
is your friendship

The four stand off Tense Until Briggs gives her answer

BRIGGS
Then let’s be friends

The Men in Suits NODand off Briggs back in the game
