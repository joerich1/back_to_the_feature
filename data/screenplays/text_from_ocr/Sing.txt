EXT SKY - NIGHT 1
The sound of an orchestra tuning up

Tilt down from twinkling stars to reveal the most beautiful old
theatre in a street heaving with life

-But not human life This is a city inhabited entirely by
animals

We glide under the illuminated marquee and through the doors into
a grand foyer where the very last patrons hurry to their seats

INT THEATRE - CONTINUOUS 2
The ornate house lights dim Voices hushed
The music starts The orchestra is loud and dramatic

BACKSTAGE A lever is pulled A sandbag drops from the
rafters

STAGE MANAGER
Places everyone

A stage light turns on and points towards the stage A MONKEY
stands in the wings and pulls tightly on a rope The Curtain
opens revealing a stage set resembling an enchanted wood

FROM THE WINGS we see the back of a FEMALE SHEEP (NANA
NOODLEMAN) in a stunning purple dress and a tiara waiting to
go on stage STAGE HANDS adjust the train of her gown

Nana’s shoulders rise and fall as she takes a last breath
before stepping out

As NANA raises her face into the spotlight she sings “Golden
Slumbers” by the Beatles

NANA
ONCE THERE WAS A WAY TO GET BACK
HOMEWARD ONCE THERE WAS A WAY TO GET
BACK HOME SLEEP PRETTY DARLING DO NOT
CRY AND I WILL SING A LULLABY

The camera turns away from the stage to view the audience

BUSTER (VO)
This was it The moment it all began
The moment an ordinary little guy fell
in love with the theatre
Sing 2

We find an adorably scruffy little koala - BUSTER MOON -
sitting with his FATHER in the balcony His father pulls him
up onto his knee Buster’s eyes are wide enthralled

BUSTER (VO)
- Everything about it the
lights the way the scenery moved
even the smell

BUSTER (VO)
He was only 6 years old but his plans to
become the first koala bear in space
were suddenly toast

Buster’s father delights in his son’s response to the show

DISSOLVE TO

EXT MOON THEATRE FOYER - DAY 3
CLOSE UP Young adult BUSTER and his FATHER

We pull back to reveal Buster about to cut a ribbon in the
theatre foyer His FATHER stands proudly next to him anda
photo is taken - freezing the action in a PHOTO

BUSTER (VO)
Some folks may have said he grew up to
be the greatest showman this city has
ever seen some called him a visionary
a maverick

The camera continues to pull wider to reveal the PHOTO hangs on a
wall amongst posters for theatre productions

BUSTER (VO)
Sure some folks said he was as crazy as
he was stubborn but I say “Wonder and
magic don’t come easy pal” And oh
there would never be any doubt

At the base of this wall of photos we find Buster sat ina
chair facing his posters He spins around and talks into
camera

BUSTER (VO)
The name Buster Moon would go down in
entertainment history And I should
know because I am Buster --

ANGRY CHIMPANZEE (0S)
--Moon Open this door
Sing 3

It’s the present day the action is now live and Buster is
startled as if waking from a dream

THE SECRETARY MISS CRAWLY - a spectacularly doddery old lizard
with one glass eye - enters through a connecting office door

MISS CRAWLY
Good morning Mr Moon

BUSTER
Miss Crawly what uhwhat’s going on

MISS CRAWLY
You gotta lot of animals waiting to see
you Mr Moon

BUSTER
I do

Buster peers through the closed blinds to see --

BUSTER (CONTD)
(Whisper)
Holy Moly I really do

-- a group of ANGRY ANIMALS waiting and pacing in the hall outside
his office KNOCKING AND SHOUTING CONTINUES THROUGHOUT

MISS CRAWLY
Yah it’s the stage crew from your last
show They say their pay checks bounced
and--

BUSTER
(Whisper to Miss Crawly)
Tell ‘em I’1l1 call up the bank and make
sure they’re paid tout suite

MISS CRAWLY
Oh I got Judith from the bank holding
on line 2 right now sir

She points towards a red light flashing on Buster’s telephone

BUSTER
Um Actually I’m gonna have to call her
back

Buster grabs a briefcase and dashes across the room
MISS CRAWLY

Oh What should I tell her this
time

Sing 4

Buster moves a large old poster to reveal a SMALL HOLE IN THE
WALL

BUSTER
(Gusto)
Tell her Buster Moon is out to lunch

And with that Buster vanishes through the hole

INT MOON THEATRE RAFTERS - CONTINUOUS 4

OS We continue to hear the muffled sound of the angry crew
knocking

Buster crawls across the narrow planks that crisscross VERY HIGH
above the stage - the stuff of vertigo

ANGRY CHIMPANZEE (0S)
Moon open this door Come on Moon I
know you’re in there

Buckets half-filled with rain water placed beneath holes in the
roof line his path Buster steps on to a LARGE WOODEN CRESCENT
MOON PROP

Buster releases a tethered rope A counterweight rises and the
MOON DROPS WITH BUSTER RIDING IT LIKE AN ELEVATOR The crescent
moon carries Buster down from the rafters and stops on the stage
(which is looking old and shabby )

EXT MOON THEATRE - MOMENTS LATER 5
Buster exits the theatre present day a little worse for wear
and squeezed between two larger more modern buildings We
can still hear the angry animals shouting his name as Buster
hops on a bicycle and cycles off down the street
ANGRY CHIMPANZEE (0S)
Moon open this door

EXT SKY - DAY 6

Buster CYCLES DOWN THE HILL AT TOP SPEED and the camera WHOOSHES
away - taking us on an epic tour of the city

He speeds down the street nearly hitting a GARBAGE TRUCK
Buster swerves avoiding cars

GARBAGE TRUCK DRIVER
Yikes
Sing 5

TITLE CARD SING

A RHINO COP directing traffic with a shrill whistle A PIG
rides a scooter over a canal bridge under which a whale
surfaces momentarily

PIG
Hey watch it

SALMON wearing neckties leap up water-filled steps WHOOSH as
Buster bikes down the same steps

We find ourselves at the end of an alleyway where we hear a
beautiful soulful voice singing ACAPPELLA “The Way I Feel
Inside” by The Zombies You would think these tender tones emanate
from a sensitive creature

JOHNNY
---IN YOUR MIND COULD YOU EVER BE

But we find the source to be a HUGE TEENAGE GORILLA idly
leaning against an alley wall and singing to no one

JOHNNY (CONTD)
REALLY CLOSE TO ME I CAN TELL THE
WAY YOU SMILE IF I FEEL THAT I COULD BE
CERTAIN THEN I WOULD SAY THE THINGS I
WANT TO SAY TONI--

The sound of a walkie-talkie cuts Johnny off

Johnny looks around the corner 2 POLICE RHINOS are strolling in
his direction

Johnny gasps as he ducks back into the shadows of the alley just
as the COPS appear - mildly curious

POLICE RHINO
Huh Thought I heard someone singin’
there Ah whatever

Johnny whispers urgently into his own WALKIE-TALKIE

JOHNNY
Guys Listen Stay where you are The
cops are here and--

Too late -- 2 HUGE GORILLAS IN BUNNY MASKS CARRYING SACKS OF
LOOT SMASH THROUGH A WINDOW FURTHER DOWN THE ALLEY ALARMS
RING

POLICE RHINO 2 POLICE RHINO
What the-- Hey Hold it right there
Sing 6

The Gorillas see the cops and dash out of sight down a
perpendicular alleyway The cops charge past JOHNNY (still
hiding in the shadows) but they are forced back against the
wall as the GANG’S TRUCK roars around the corner then
chargesright past them

BIG DADDY
Go go go

POLICE RHINOS
Woah

As the truck passes JOHNNY - he leaps on to the back where the two
other Gorilla’s cling to their loot The leader (BIG DADDY)
commands with fierce authority

BIG DADDY
Johnny You were supposed to be keepin’
a lookout

JOHNNY
(out of breath)
Sorry Dad

BIG DADDY
And where’s ya mask

Johnny awkwardly pulls on a bunny mask Sirens wail as the VAN
takes a hairpin bend -- WHOOSH The camera FLIES away twisting
and turning through the city

-into the window of AN APARTMENT where we find ROSITA (A FEMALE
PIG) washing dishes while singing along with the radio playing
“Firework” by Katy Perry

RADIOROSITA
DO YOU EVER FEEL LIKE A PLASTIC BAG
DRIFTING THROUGH THE WIND WANTING TO
START AGAIN

Rosita turns to switch off the tap in time to stop a jug of water
from over-flowing She turns kicks a football safely out of her

way and carries a jug of water towards a table where 25 PIGLETS

feast on their lunch like barbarians

ROSITA
DO YOU EVER FEEL FEEL SO PAPER THIN

As she re-fills their glasses some of the piglets CRINGE at her
singing Another piglet (CASPAR) leaps on to the table

PIGLET CASPAR
Look at me - I’m mommy LA LA LA
Sing 7

He crudely mimics Rosita singing and the piglets EXPLODE WITH
LAUGHTER

ROSITA
Caspar get off the table

He doesn’t of course so Rosita has to wrangle him instead
NORMAN Rosita’s husband enters wearing a suit and tie

NORMAN
Rosita have you seen my car keys

PIGLETS
La la laaa La la la la la

Rosita pulls the car keys out of a piglet’s mouth and hurls them
to Norman before dealing with Caspar who continues to mock her
singing

ROSITA
Norman would you please tell them what
a good singer I am

Norman checks his phone as he talks

NORMAN
Oh yeah you were great honey--

He kisses Rosita’s cheek and rushes to the door

NORMAN (0S) (CONTD)
---By the way the bathroom sink is
blocked again Bye honey

SLAM He exits leaving Rosita in the midst of chaos She walks to
the window turns up the radio and gazes wistfully into the
distance as she leans against the windowsill -- WHOOSH The camera
continues straight out of the window PAST THE UNDERPANTS -- Shoots
through the city Towards the party side of town and through
the air vents of a Tiki bar

LANCE
1 2 1 2 3 4

-- To a stage where a surly GOTH PORCUPINE DUO (LANCE and
ASH) perform an original song “I DON’T WANNA” Imagine
Siouxsie Sioux and Robert Smith but bristling with black
quills and playing electric guitars

LANCE (CONTD)
Sing 8

I DONT WANNA TALK TO YA I DONT WANNA
WALK WITH YA IM NOT GONNA PLAY FOR YA I
DONT NEED ANYONE ELSE I LIVE MY LIFE BY
MYSELF NOT LISTENING ANYWAY

ASH
NOTHING TO SAY OUT OF THE WAY
DONT WANNA PLAY I DONT NEED
ANYONE ELSE YEAH YEAH I LIVE MY
LIFE BY MYSELF YEAH YEAH CANT
STAND THE THINGS THAT YOU SAY--

LANCE plays it cool but ASH gets carried away kicks over her own
mic and joins LANCE on lead vocals at his mic LANCE pushes ASH
off of his mic

BUT THE MUSIC SUDDENLY STOPS DEAD and the camera turns to reveal a
contrasting scene a cheesy HAWAIIAN-STYLE BAR empty except for
the owner A BEAR called HARRY in a Hawaiian shirt who has pulled
the plug and holds it up - aghast

HARRY
Oh my gosh I thought you guys said you
were musicians

CUT TO

MINUTES LATER We remain in the bar as ASH AND LANCE pack up and
the next band set uptune

LANCE
Ash - babe - I’m the lead singer okay
Just stick to the backing vocals

ASH
Sorry I--I get carried away

LANCE
Yeah I know right it just kind of
ruins my song ya know

WHOOSH We zoom through the streets until we find ourselves
outside a small house --

MEENA’S HOUSEKITCHEN

MEENA (a female teenage elephant) lights the last of 70 candles on
a birthday cake

Meena carries the cake in while singing HAPPY BIRTHDAY Her voice
is beautiful The house is very small indeed

MEENA

your candles

GRANDPA ELEPHANT
Humph

Grandpa closes his eyes takes a deep breath and blows out the
candles with a great BLAST of his trunk -- WHOOSH -- The BLAST
carries us out of the house down the street and up to--

-- The steps of a subway station where a lone saxophone
reverberates A white mouse called MIKE plays a superb sax solo

A BABOON tosses a coin into his case Mike stops playing and
regards the coin with disgust
Sing 10

MIKE
A penny How dare you I happened to
have studied at the Lincoln School of

Music

BABOON
Sorry it’s it’s all I got right now
Heh

MIKE

(Sarcastic)
Oh is that so

He JUMPS down the stairs and grabs the Baboon by the collar

MIKE (CONTD)
(Fire and brimstone)
Alright prove it pal

BABOON

The Baboon is totally freaked out and awkwardly empties his
pockets Mike checks everything that lands on the ground

BABOON
(out of breath)
Trying to find trying to find

MIKE
Wha--What is this ya got here

BABOON
(Wheezing)
That’s my inhaler

The baboon’s money clip filled with bills lands on the ground
Mike grabs it and waves it like a defence lawyer to passers by

MIKE
Ah ha I knew it You all saw it You
all saw it right here The monkey lied

BABOON
WhaI forgot I had that

The baboon clears his throat Mike takes a handful of dollars out
and hurls the empty money clip at the baboon
Sing 11

BABOON (CONTD)
An

MIKE
And next time pick on someone ya own
size You bully

The wheezing Baboon runs for his life as Mike resumes his sax
tune

-- WHOOSH -- we zoom away from Mike and the Baboon to The
fanciest restaurant in town - LES CALMARS - named after its
distinctive use of squid-filled tanks Buster arrives on his
bicycle beside the valet parking attendant (A CHIMPANZEE) Buster
walks away and the bike frame falls apart in the valet’s hands

BUSTER
Take care of her will you She may
look old and rusty but she is a
classic

INT LES CALMARS - DAY 7

We find Buster and his friend Eddie (A SHEEP) sitting at a table
in this extremely fancy restaurant A gigantic tank filled with
luminous squid frames their conversation

BUSTER
Okay listen we both know that my

rough times lately But as the saying

lining” We’ve got--

where it knocks into a BULL who drops his cell phone into his
soup

it slides down ROSITA TILTS HER HEAD TO READ IT

ROSITA’S POV The words SINGING CONTEST slide through frame

BACK TO ROSITA She is so distracted by this idea that the phone
slips from Rosita’s shoulder into the sink and her face lights up
in recognition of this golden opportunity

The camera pulls back from her window wider and wider to reveal
the city at night and one last flyer falling to the ground like a
leaf

A Spanish language version of the Gipsy Kings’ “Bamboleo”
plays on the loud speaker Rosita is unaware her fingers are
tapping in time with the music The music begins to take her
over Rosita dances just a little at first but gradually
showing more and more confidence

SECURITY ROOM We see the back of the security guard lean in
to get a better look at his screen ROSITA IS DANCING IN ONE
OF THE AISLES The guard reaches out and turns up the music

Rosita is really going for it now - spinning along the frozen
food section that spills icy fog across the floor She grabs
her trolley as if it were her dance partner runs and leaps
into the air - sailing and spinning all the way to the end of
the aisle THE TRIUMPHANT MOMENT IS SUDDENLY BROKEN BY

The lady in aisle 6

a bow

circle causing them to splinter and buckle The water valve
breaks and water explodes out of it
