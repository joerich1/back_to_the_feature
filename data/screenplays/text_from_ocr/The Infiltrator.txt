MEAT LOCKER - DAY

Dim light Frozen slabs of beef dangle from hooks A TAPE
RECORDER on the greasy floor

FREDDIE ‘SCAP’ SCAPA (30’s) sits crosslegged eating
sausages off a paper plate Quick methodical bites like
a military man in the mess hall Scap’s shirtless
covered in religious tattoos Angels a Catholic Cross A
pistol pokes out the back of his jeans

Scap
past

licks the juice off his fingertips stands He moves
the sides of beef finally arriving at KEVIN FULTON

(30s) hanging upside down between two pink carcasses
ankles roped to a hook in the ceiling

Fulton is completely still Not even a breath There’s

duct

tape over his eyes A dirty bandage on his forehead

His arms and legs are tied

It’s

Scap

very likely Fulton’s dead

starts circling him Scap’s seething a beast of

adrenaline and testosterone His melodic Irish accent
comes out in clipped rapid-fire bursts

SCAP
D’ya reckon I enjoy this Bit of a rush
Bollix Awful Nasty business Sickens me
to death Only reason I can do what I do
and even look meself in the mirror is
because what you done boyo--to me to
your mates to your poor wife to every
wee baby from Dublin to Derry--is just
about as foul a thing as a fella can do
But I reckon that’s why they call you
Stakeknife ain’t it Because you stuck
every last one of us right in the heart

No answer Without another word Scap whips out the
pistol and fires three DEAFENING SHOTS an inch from
Fulton’s eardrum Still Fulton doesn’t stir

Finally Scap rips the tape off Fulton’s eyes They’re
open Hateful red pinpricks Scap cocks the pistol

BANG

ROLL

FULTON
I told you me name ain’t Stake--

A noise behind them

CUT TO BLACK

thing I never lied about from the day we
met to this very moment here is that I

up to those boys on a platter before I
ever put ya in danger again

A head-splitting cacophony of electrical WHIRRING and
GRINDING

Fulton has turned everything on

TV’s blare news Music screams over multiple stereos
creating an unintelligible cloud of discord Smoke alarms
whine

It’s worthless he’s completely drowned out by the din

An inaudible response He moves to the TV Just as Scap

footprint beyond that by the back door

Scap raises his rifle pads slowly out the door

sight He’s holding a hand out

Scap raises the RIFLE to his eye aims

adjusts the sight

He’s looking straight back at Scap In his outstretched
hand is a small black REMOTE

A smoking pile of charred wood steel and glass running
up and down the bluffs

FULTON steps over the rubble shotgun pointed kicking up
chunks of sidewall to make sure he’s finished the job

At last Fulton kicks over a hunk of wood sees Scap lying
on the sand wheezing inches from death

Scap’s face is a mess of blood and burnt flesh one of
his eyes is sealed shut

Scap looks up his lips cracking open slightly to reveal
bloodstained teeth He lets out a wheezy LAUGH
