INT CLASSROOM DAY

A private day school Twenty 10th grade boys are sitting in desks in geometry class They are dressed in
school uniform light blue shirts and khakis The boys look dazed and sleepy

The teacher MR ADAMS is at the front of the room finishing a complicated equation on the
chalkboard

MR ADAMS

Except when the value of the x coordinate is less than or equal to the value of the -- Yes Isaac
A boy named ISAAC has raised his hand

ISAAC

What about that problem

Isaac points to a startling and intricate arrangement of huge numbers and strange symbols filling up a
forgotten corner of the chalkboard The heading above it says Extra Credit

MR ADAMS

Oh really just put that up there as a joke Thats probably the hardest geometry problem in the world
ISAAC

How much extra credit is it worth

MR ADAMS

Well Ive never seen anyone get it right before including my mentor Dr Leaky at MIT So guess if
anyone here can do it

(pause)

Id see to it that none of you ever have to open another math book again for the rest of your lives
There is some quite murmuring The name Fischer is repeated over and over The boys begin to look to a
student in the back row

Unlike his classmates he wears the Rushmore school blazer with insignia on the breast pocket and a
Rushmore rep tie knotted tightly His hair is smartly parted and swept back He is extremely skinny and
pale He is MAX FISCHER

Max has a cup of coffee on his desk and he is reading the Wall Street Journal

MR ADAMS

Max You want to try it

Max looks up

MAX

Im sorry Did someone say my name

Everyone laughs Max smiles slightly He buttons his blazer and straightens his tie He picks up his cup of
coffee and takes a sip He goes to the chalkboard and sets to work

The boys watch with nervous anticipation Mr Adams compares Maxs progress with e notes in his book
Maxs equations quickly fills up most of the chalkboard He finishes it with a flourish throws his piece of
chalk in the trash and turns to face the

class

Everyone looks to Mr Adams Mr Adams raises an eyebrow He nods

The classroom erupts into wild ecstatic applause Everyone surrounds Max cheering as he walks calmly
back to his desk They hoist him into the air

CUT TO

Max with his eyes closed smiling serenely listening to the applause He mutters
MAX

Gentlemen gentlemen please

A little hand grabs Maxs arm and shakes him Max opens his eyes The person shaking him is his chapel
partner DIRK CALLOWAY a fourth grader with neatly white hair Max looks around
They are in chapel surrounded by rows of boys in school uniforms Dirk puts his finger to his lips
DIRK
Shh

Max rubs his eyes and sits up in the pew The applause dies down and Max looks to the pulpit as the
guest chapel speaker HERMAN BLUME steps up to the microphone

Mr Blume is a tough looking guy about fifty years old in a black suit He begins his chapel speech
MR BLUME

You guys have it real easy never had it like this where grew up But send my kids here Because the
fact is whether you deserve it or not you go to one of the best schools in the country

Maxs eyes lights up

MR BLUME

Rushmore You lucked out

Max leans forward to the railing and begins to listen intently

MR BLUME

Now for some of you it doesnt matter You were born rich and youre going to stay rich But heres my
advice to the rest of you take dead aim on the rich boys Get them in the crosshairs And take them

down

Some of the students and faculty begin to look at each other with puzzled expressions Max is nodding
and taking notes on the flypage of a hymnal

INSERT HYMNAL

Rushmore -- best school in country

Mr Blume leaves the podium Max leaps to his feet and leads the applause The organ starts and
everyone stands up
