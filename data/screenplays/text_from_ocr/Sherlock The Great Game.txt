He puts his head in his hands and sobs Sherlock nods to a
stocky BELARUS POLICEMAN and gets to his feet
BEZZA (CONTD)
Look you’ve gotta help me Mr
Holmes Everyone says you’re the
best Without you I’1l get hung

INT BAKER STREET NIGHT 4
JOHN goes through into the kitchen

JOHN
What about that Russian case

SHERLOCK (0S)
Belarus Open and shut domestic
murder Not worth my time

JOHN
Shame Anything in I’m starving

He opens the fridge door

Shoot through the back of the fridge to show -- the back of a
bloodied head John gawps and steps away

JOHN (CONTD)
A head A severed head

SHERLOCK

JOHN

There’s a head in the fridge
SHERLOCK

Yes
JOHN

A bloody head

SHERLOCK

Had to put it somewhere You don’t
mind do you Got it from Bart’s
morgue I’m measuring the
coagulation of saliva after death

(nods at laptop)
I see you’ve written up the Taxi
Driver case

JOHN
(distracted)
Umyeah

He slams shut the fridge door

SHERLOCK
‘A Study in Pink’ Nice

JOHN
Well you know Pink lady pink
case pink phone There was a lot
of pink Did you like it
SHERLOCK

JOHN
Why not I thought you’d
beflattered

SHERLOCK
Flattered
(reads from blog)
“Sherlock sees right through

everyone and everything in seconds

What’s incredible though is how
spectacularly ignorant he is about
some things”

JOHN
Hang on I didn’t mean -

SHERLOCK
What you meant “spectacularly
ignorant” in a nice way Look it
doesn’t matter to me who’s Prime
Minister Or who’s sleeping with
who -

JOHN
Or that the earth goes round the
Sun

SHERLOCK
Oh that again It’s not important

JOHN
Not important It’s primary school
stuff How can you not know that

SHERLOCK
If I ever did I’ve deleted it

JOHN
Deleted it

SHERLOCK
Listen -

He jabs a bony finger to his temple

(MORE)

SHERLOCK (CONTD)
THIS is my hard drive Only makes
sense to put stuff in there that’s
useful Really useful Ordinary
people fill their brains with all
kinds of rubbish
SHERLOCK (CONTD)
And then it’s impossible to get at
the stuff that matters You follow

JOHN
But it’s the Solar System -

SHERLOCK
What the hell does that matter So
we go around the Sun If we went
round the Moon or round and
round the garden like a teddy bear
it wouldn’t make any difference
All that matters is the work
Without it my brain rots Put that
in your blog Or better still
stop inflicting your opinions on
the world

John glares at him - then heads for the door

SHERLOCK (CONTD)
Where are you going

JOHN
Out
(pointed)
I need some air

He makes to go almost colliding with MRS HUDSON

MRS HUDSON
Oh sorry love

JOHN
Sorry -

And he’s gone Mrs Hudson looks after his retreating back and
then over to Sherlock

MRS HUDSON
You two had a littledomestic

Sherlock gets up and stares moodily out of the window He
watches John leave the house

SHERLOCK
Look at that Mrs Hudson Quiet
Calm Peaceful Isn’t it hateful

MRS HUDSON
I’m sure something’11l turn up
Sherlock
(brightly)
A nice murder That’1ll cheer you
up
SHERLOCK
Can’t come too soon

Mrs Hudson suddenly notices the bullet-pocked plaster
MRS HUDSON
Oi What have you done to my bloody
wall
Smiling Sherlock turns to her and --

BOOM The empty house opposite explodes in a huge fireball

All the windows shatter Sherlock throws himself onto Mrs
Hudson and they dive to the floor

JOHN
And the time after that

Sarah smiles and snaps on the TV

SARAH

JOHN

SARAH
(leaving)
Mind if I shower first

JOHN
No no Go ahead I’m in no hurry

He’s suddenly distracted by the TV News footage of Baker
Street and the ruins where the empty house used to stand

Sound of a shower from the next room
John’s face falls
JOHN (CONTD)

MYCROFT
This is of national importance

SHERLOCK
How’s the diet

MYCROFT
Fine
-e--Maybe you can get through to
him John

JOHN

MYCROFT
I’m afraid my brother can be very
intransigent

10A

SHERLOCK
If you’re so keen why don’t you
investigate it
He stops

MYCROFT
No no no I can’t possibly leave
the office for any length of time
Not with the Korean elections so
near -

Smiles sweetly

MYCROFT (CONTD)
Yes well you don’t need to know
about that do you Besides a case
like this It requires
(infinite disdain)
-leg-work

SHERLOCK
(to John)
How’s Sarah How was the 1i-lo

MYCROFT
Sofa Sherlock It was the sofa

SHERLOCK
Of course

JOHN
How - Never mind

Mycroft looks searchingly at John

MYCROFT
Sherlock’s business seems to be
booming since you becamepals
What’s he like to live with
Hellish I imagine

JOHN
I’m never bored

MYCROFT
Good That’s good isn’t it He’s a
real live wire is Sherlock When
we were children he worked out
from the angle of the car seats and
a smear of lipstick in the back of
the Audi that Dad was having it off
with the au pair I’m afraid Mum
wasn’t too pleased and that was
that Bang went our happy home

He gazes levelly at Sherlock

(MORE)

MYCROFT (CONTD)
Such a clever boy but he really
should have got his priorities
right Like now

MYCROFT (CONTD)
(holds up some documents )
Andrew West Known as “Westie” to
his friends Civil servant Found
dead on the rails at Battersea

Jumped in front of a train
MYCROFT

That seems the logical assumption
JOHN

But
MYCROFT

But
JOHN

Well you wouldn’t be here if it
was just an accident

SHERLOCK
(tickled)
Ha

MYCROFT
The Ministry of Defence has been
working on a new missile defence
system The Bruce-Partington
Program it’s called And the plans
for it were on a memory stick

JOHN
That wasn’t very clever

MYCROFT
(withering)
It’s not the only copy But it is
secret And missing

JOHN
(delighted)
Top secret

MYCROFT
Very We think West must’ve taken
the memory stick and we can’t
possibly risk it falling into the
wrong hands
You’ve got to find those plans
Sherlock Don’t make me order you

SHERLOCK
Like to see you try

Silence

MYCROFT
Think it over

Mycroft winces slightly touches his jaw then takes John’s
hand again

MYCROFT (CONTD)
Good bye John

(pointed)
See you very soon

He goes out closing the door

Sherlock picks up his violin and starts sawing away at it
with furious energy

JOHN
Why did you lie

SHERLOCK
What

JOHN

Youve got nothing on Not a single
case That’s why the wall took a
pounding Why did you tell your
brother you were busy

SHERLOCK
Why shouldn’t I

JOHN
Oh Sibling rivalry Nice Now

INT SCOTLAND YARD LESTRADE’S OFFICE DAY 10

LESTRADE’S bleakly modern office Strip-lights wilting pot
plants Lestrade is at a filing cabinet SHERLOCK and JOHN
enter

LESTRADE
(without looking up)
You only like the funny cases

SHERLOCK
Obviously

LESTRADE
You’re gonna love this
(to John)
Hi

JOHN
Inspector

LESTRADE
That explosion

SHERLOCK
Gas leak yes

Lestrade shakes his head

SHERLOCK (CONT’D)

No
LESTRADE

Made to look like one Explosives
JOHN

What
LESTRADE

Hardly anything left of the place
Except a strong box A very strong
box And inside it was this

He hands an envelope across to Sherlock

It’s good quality Cream-coloured On it in spidery writing
Sherlock Holmes By Hand

Sherlock looks up surprised

SHERLOCK
You haven’t opened it

LESTRADE
Addressed to you isn’t it We’ve X-
rayed it Not booby trapped

SHERLOCK
How reassuring

Sherlock looks closely at the envelope

SHERLOCK (CONTD)
Nice stationery Bohemian

LESTRADE

SHERLOCK
From the Czech Republic No finger-
prints
LESTRADE
No
SHERLOCK

She used a fountain pen Parker
Duofold Iridium nib

JOHN

SHERLOCK

JOHN
Obviously

Carefully Sherlock opens the envelope From inside
tumblesan iPhone But not any old phone - the pink covered
phone from Episode One

JOHN (CONTD)
But that’s - that’s the phone the
pink phone

LESTRADE
What from ‘A Study in Pink’

SHERLOCK
Well it isn’t of course but it’s
supposed to look like it -
(MORE)

SHERLOCK (CONTD)
(breaks off realises
looks at Lestrade)
‘A Study in Pink’ - you read his
blog

LESTRADE
‘Course I read his blog we all do
Do you really not know the Earth
goes round the Sun

A snort of laughter from a few desks away Sherlock glances
round SALLY DONOVAN pretending she hasn’t been listening

SHERLOCK

(moving swiftly on)
It’s not the same phone this one’s
brand new But someone’s gone to a
lot of trouble to make it look like
the same phone which suggests your
blog -

(fires such a look at

John)
- has a wider readership

He turns on the phone and super-quick keys in a retrieval
code

He puts the phone on speaker mode

PHONE VOICE
You have one new message

They listen rapt
From the phone Beep Beep Beep Beep Beep

JOHN
That’s it

Close on the phone a photo is downloading

SHERLOCK
No that’s not it

Close on the photo the inside of a bare empty flat

LESTRADE
What the hell are we supposed to
make of that An estate agent’s
photo and the bloody Greenwich

pips
Beat

SHERLOCK
(grave)
It’s a warning

JOHN
A warning

Sherlock grabs the phone from Lestrade

SHERLOCK

(realising)
Some secret societies used to send
dried Melon seeds Orange pips
Things like that Five pips
They’re warning us that it’s going
to happen again

(stares at phone)
I’ve seen this place before

JOHN
Hang on Whats going to happen
again
SHERLOCK
(at the door)
Boom
CUT TO
EXT BAKER STREET DAY 11

A cab screeches to a halt outside their flat

SHERLOCK almost flings himself out of it Behind him JOHN
LESTRADE But he heads not for the front door but down the
steps to the basement level

With him --

- and we see a neglected door On the wall next it is a grimy
intercom system

CLOSE on it almost hidden by grime 221c
On Sherlock triumph

CUT TO

INT BAKER STREET OUTSIDE 221C DAY 12
LATER

MRS HUDSON is now with them outside the interior door of the
basement flat sorting through a bunch of keys

MRS HUDSON
He had a look didn’t you
Sherlock when you first came to
see about the flat I can’t get
anyone interested in it The damp I
expect It’s the curse of
basements

Sherlock has his face pressed to the door

MRS HUDSON (CONTD)
I had a place once when I was
first married black mould all up
the walls it was like a weight on
your chest -

SHERLOCK

Door’s been opened Recently
MRS HUDSON

No Can’t have been This is the

only key

Sherlock just takes the key off her inserts it into the lock
and pushes the door slowly open

We see a bare room Pale daylight spills through dusty net
curtains

And in the centre of the room a pair of battered trainers

JOHN
Shoes

They go in

MRS HUDSON
Now I’ve had Mr Merryman round to
look at the damage -

Clunk Sherlock shuts the door in her face

Then he quickly examines the rest of the room getting down
onto the bare floorboards to stare at the shoes

Suddenly -- the Pink phone starts ringing in Sherlock’s hand
He answers it putting it on speaker so the others can hear

SHERLOCK
Hello

And over the phone a terrible whimpering sniffling A woman
crying As she speaks her voice is shaky and wracked with
sobs

CRYING WOMAN (VO)
Hello sexy

SHERLOCK
Who is this

CRYING WOMAN (VO)
I’ve sent youa little
puzzlejust to sayhi

They are all exchanging glances now What Such a weird
contrast between the voice and the words

SHERLOCK
Who’s talking Are you crying

CRYING WOMAN (VO)
I’m not cryingI’m typing

They all look at each other What the hell Typing

CRYING WOMAN (V0O) (CONTD)
And this stupid bitchis reading
it out

A real thud of realisation as they work out what’s happening
Except Sherlock’s eyes are shining

SHERLOCK
(sotto)
The curtain rises

JOHN
What

SHERLOCK
Nothing

JOHN

No What do you mean

SHERLOCK
Just that I’ve been expecting
something like this

CRYING WOMAN (VO)
Twelve hours to solve my puzzle
Sherlock Or I’m going to be so
naughty

And the woman starts sobbing her heart out The sound fills
the room Lestrade and John horrified Sherlock - cold
bemused And fascinated

Click - end of call
Silence in the room

CUT TO

INT BART’S HOSPITAL DAY 13

SHERLOCK is minutely examining the trainers A microscope
projects images onto the wall behind him Huge alien-looking
clusters Pollen

He is totally eerily focussed on his work John is pacing
next to him clearly still chilled by what he heard

JOHN
Who do you suppose it was
The woman on the phone - the crying
woman

SHERLOCK
Oh she doesn’t matter Just a
hostage There’s no lead there

JOHN
For God’s sake I wasn’t thinking
about leads

SHERLOCK
Then you’re not going to be much
use to her

JOHN
Are they trying to trace it Trace
the call

Sherlock’s phone beeps A text has arrived

SHERLOCK
The bomber’s too clever for that
Pass me my phone

JOHN
Where is it

SHERLOCK
Jacket

John looks round realises - Sherlock is wearing his jacket
Used to this behaviour John pulls Sherlock’s phone from his
jacket pocket

JOHN
Text from your brother
SHERLOCK
Delete it
JOHN

Delete it

SHERLOCK
Those missile plans will be out of
the country now Nothing we can do
about it

JOHN
(looks at phone)
Mycroft thinks there is He’s
texted you eight times Must be
important

SHERLOCK
Then why didn’t he cancel his
dental appointment

JOHN
His what

SHERLOCK
Mycroft never texts if he can talk
Look Andrew West stole the plans
tried to sell them got his head
smashed in for his pains - end of
story The only mystery is this
why is my brother so determined to
bore me when someone else is being
so delightfully interesting

On John - just a little appalled at his friend

JOHN
Yeah try and remember there’s a
woman who might die

SHERLOCK
What for This hospital is full of
dying people Doctor Go and cry at
their bedsides see what good it
does them

He changes the image on the microscope cries out in
satisfaction

MISS HOOPER

(entering)
Any luck
SHERLOCK
Oh yes

Another Bart’s staff member walks in JIM 30s slight
pleasant-looking

JIM
Oh Sorry Didn’t know -

MISS HOOPER
Jim Hi Come in come in Jim
this is Sherlock Holmes

She gazes doe-eyed at Sherlock then remembers John

MISS HOOPER (CONTD)
And - Oh ersorry

JOHN
John Watson Hi

JIM
Hi
(to Sherlock)
So you’re Sherlock Holmes Molly’s
told me all about you Are you on
one of your cases

Sherlock doesn’t even look up

MISS HOOPER
Jim works in IT upstairs That’s
how we met Office romance

Sherlock glances up at Jim briefly

SHERLOCK
(sotto)
Gay

MISS HOOPER
--sorry what

SHERLOCK
Nothing Um Hey
(unconvincing)

Hey
Jim knocks into a kidney-dish which clatters to the floor

JIM
Sorry Sorry

He hands the dish back to Sherlock Sherlock glances inside
then looks up twinkling a little

JIM (CONTD)
Well Id better be off See you at
the Fox Sixish

MISS HOOPER
Yeah

JIM
Bye then Nice to meet you

JOHN
You too

JIM goes out smiling

MISS HOOPER
What do you mean gay We’re
together

SHERLOCK
And domestic bliss must suit you
Molly You’ve put on three pounds
since I last saw you

MISS HOOPER
(mortified)
Two and a half

JOHN
Sherlock

MISS HOOPER
He’s not gay Why do you have to
spoil - He’s not

SHERLOCK
With that level of personal
grooming

JOHN
What A bit of product in his hair
I put product in my hair

SHERLOCK
You wash your hair There’s a
difference No no Tinted
eyelashes clear signs of taurine
cream around the frown lines and
those tired clubber’s eyes Then
there’s his underwear

MISS HOOPER
His underwear

SHERLOCK
Visible above his waist Very
visible Very particular brand
That plus the extremely suggestive
fact that he just dropped his phone
number in this dish and Id say
youd better spare yourself the
pain and break if off now

Miss Hooper bursts into tears and runs out of the room

JOHN
Charming Well done

SHERLOCK
Just saving her time Isn’t that
kinder

JOHN
Kinder No Sherlock That wasnt
kind

He looks anxiously at his watch SHERLOCK chucks the trainers
across to him

SHERLOCK
Go on then

JOHN
Eh

SHERLOCK
You know what I do Off you go

JOHN
No

SHERLOCK
Go on

JOHN

No I’m not going to sit here so
you can humiliate -

SHERLOCK
An outside eye A second opinion
It’s very useful to me

John shoots him a look

SHERLOCK (CONTD)
Really

John shrugs Accepts

JOHN
Theyre just a pair of shoes
(corrects himself)
Trainers

SHERLOCK
Good

John turns them over in his hands Sherlock starts tapping
away on his PDA

JOHN
Well they’re in good nick Id say
they were pretty new but -

(examining soles)
(MORE)
24A

JOHN (CONTD)

- the soles are well-worn so the
owner has had them for a while

SHERLOCK
Yup

JOHN
(warming to his theme)
Very 80s Probably one of those
retro designs

SHERLOCK
Youre on sparkling form What
else

JOHN

Theyre pretty big but -

Sherlock gives an encouraging smile to John John suddenly
beams Holds out the shoe We see a completely blurred felt-
tipped name

(MORE)

JOHN (CONTD)
There’s traces of a name inside In
felt tip Grown-ups don’t put their
names in their shoes They belonged
to a kid

SHERLOCK
(sincerely)
Excellent What else

JOHN
That’s it

SHERLOCK
That’s it

SHERLOCK (CONTD)

JOHN
How did I do

SHERLOCK
Really well John Really well

John beams

SHERLOCK (CONTD)
I mean you’ve missed almost
everything of importance but you
know

Sherlock takes the trainers from him and his gaze flicks over
them

SHERLOCK (CONTD)
The owner loved these Scrubbed
them clean whitened them where
they’ve got discoloured and changed
the laces threeno four times
Even so there’re traces of flaky
skin where his fingers have come
into contact with them So he
suffered from eczema The trainers
are well-worn but much more so on
the inner side Which means the
owner had weak arches

He sniffs the shoes

SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
British made And twenty years old

JOHN
Twenty years -

SHERLOCK
Not retro They’re original

He flashes his PDA

SHERLOCK (CONTD)
Limited edition Two blue stripes

JOHN
But they’ve still got mud on them
They look new
SHERLOCK
(darkly)
Someone’s kept them that way
Quite a bit of mud caked on the
soles Analysis shows it’s from
Sussex but with London mud
overlaying it

JOHN
How do you know

SHERLOCK

(gestures at microscope

image)
Pollen Clear as a map reference to
me South of the river too So the
child who owned these trainers came
to London from Sussex twenty years
ago and left them behind

JOHN
So what happened to them

SHERLOCK
Something bad He loved these
shoes remember Wouldn’t leave
them filthy Wouldn’t let them go
unless he had no choice So kid
with big feet gets - oh

JOHN
What

SHERLOCK
(pole-axed)

sports tournament drowned in the
pool Tragic accident You won’t

JOHN

SHERLOCK
Nobody thought so Nobody except
me I was only a child myself I
read about it in the paper

JOHN
Started young didn’t you

SHERLOCK
The boy Carl Powers had some sort
of fit in the water By the time
they got him out it was too late
(MORE )

SHERLOCK (CONTD)

Beat

But there was something wrong
Something I couldn’t get out of my
head

JOHN
What

SHERLOCK
His shoes

JOHN

What about them

SHERLOCK
They werent there I made a bit of
a fuss Tried to get the police
interested But no-one thought it
was important He’d left all the
rest of his clothes in his locker
you see But there was no sign of
his shoes

SHERLOCK (CONTD)
Until now

INT BAKER STREET KITCHEN-LAB NIGHT

CUT TO

Track across the steel draining board of the flat’s ex-
kitchen sink The trainers are in bits sliced up by the
scalpel that gleams next to them

String has been pinned up from corner to corner and bits of
the trainers hang from them like photos in a dark-room

SHERLOCK is poring over police documents

JOHN pops his head through the plastic-strip curtain

JOHN
Can I help I want to help There’s
only five hours left

His mobile pings John glances at it

JOHN (CONTD)
Mycroft He’s texting me now

JOHN
He did say “national importance”

SHERLOCK
How quaint

JOHN
What Carl Powers was murdered

Sherlock dashes to his lap-top calls up his own website

SHERLOCK
Remember the shoe-laces The boy
suffered from eczema It would be
the easiest thing in the world to
introduce the poison into his
medication A few hours later he
came up to London for the swimming
competition the poison took
effect paralysed the muscles and
he drowned

JOHN
How come the autopsy didn’t -

SHERLOCK

Virtually undetectable And no-one
would’ve been looking for it

(excited)
But there were tiny traces still
inside the trainers From where
he’d rubbed the cream into his
feet That’s why they had to go

JOHN
So how do we let the bomber know

SHERLOCK
We get his attention

He finishes typing sits back and reads

Close on laptop On it he’s blogged - ‘FOUND Pair of
trainers belonging to Carl Powers (1978- 1989) Botulinim
toxin still present Apply 221b Baker St’

A tiny red light from a sniper’s rifle bobs over her

Blue lights flash over her face The wail of sirens The roar
of cars screeching to a halt outside

On living room door as it is smashed open by the police
A POLICEMAN in the doorway stares -
- then starts forward -

Not about Exactly a pint That was
their first mistake
The blood is definitely Monkford’s
But it’s been frozen

some time ago And that’s what they
spread all over the seat

He grabs the flash gun from Sherlock and fires it off right
in Kenny’s face Kenny is blinded and the cat jumps from his
arms In a second John is on the floor his face pressed
close to the cat

KENNY

EXT STREET DAY
JOHN hurries away from the house laughing

JOHN
Yes Yes

He almost punches the air SHERLOCK smiles kindly

SHERLOCK
You think it was the cat It wasn’t
the cat

JOHN

What No Yes It is It must be
That’s how he got the tetanus into
her system Its paws stink of
disinfectant

SHERLOCK
It’s a lovely idea -

JOHN
He coated it onto the claws of her
cat It’s a new pet Bound to be a
bit jumpy around her A scratch was
almost inevitable But she’d never
pay much attention to it and -

SHERLOCK
I thought of it as soon as I saw

that scratch on her arm But it’s
too random And too clever for the
brother

JOHN
He murdered his sister for her
money

SHERLOCK
Did he

CUT TO

JOHN
(face falls)
Didn’t he

SHERLOCK
No It was revenge

JOHN
Revenge Who wanted revenge

SHERLOCK
Raoul The houseboy Kenny Prince
was the butt of his sister’s jokes
week in week out Virtually a
bullying campaign Finally they
fell out Badly It’s all on the
fan sites She was going to
disinherit Kenny Raoul had grown
used to a certain standard of
living so

JOHN
(clutching at straws)
What about the disinfectant On the
cat’s claws

SHERLOCK
Raoul keeps a very clean house You
came in through the kitchen door
You saw that floor Scrubbed within
an inch of its life You smell of
disinfectant now

John is crestfallen
SHERLOCK (CONTD)
No the cat doesn’t come into it

that poisoned Connie Prince It was
Botulinim toxin

A look from John

SHERLOCK (CONTD)
We’ve been here before Carl
Powers Tut-tut Our bomber is
repeating himself

LESTRADE
How did he do it

SHERLOCK
Botox injection

LESTRADE
Botox

SHERLOCK

Botox is a diluted form of
Botulinim Among other things
Raoul de Santos was employed to
give Connie her regular facial
injections My Home Office contact
got me a complete record of Raoul’s
internet purchases He’s been
ordering Botox in bulk for months
Bided his time then upped the
strength to a fatal dose

LESTRADE
Are you sure

SHERLOCK
I’m sure

Lestrade grabs his phone dashes out into the corridor

JOHN
How long

SHERLOCK
What

JOHN

How long have you known

SHERLOCK
Well this was quite a simple one
really Like I said the bomber’s
repeated himself That was a
mistake

JOHN
But the hostage That old woman on

SHERLOCK
Yes Well I suppose I lost that

solve the case so -

JOHN
What the hell does that matter
People are dying

SHERLOCK
(thinking)
He killed the old woman because she
was starting to describe him Not

he’s put himself in the firing
line

JOHN
What do you mean

SHERLOCK
Well usually he must stay above it
all He arranges these things but
no-one ever has direct contact

JOHN
What Like Connie Prince’s murder
He arranged that People come to
him to get their crimes fixed up
Like booking a holiday

SHERLOCK
It’s novel

John points to the TV news RAOUL is being bundled out of his
house and into a waiting police car

JOHN
Maybe he was older than Carl

SHERLOCK
The thought had occurred

JOHN
So why is he doing this Playing

wants to be caught

SHERLOCK
I think he wants to be distracted

He cradles the phone His eyes are shining

On John disturbed Even angry He glances at the smiley
face

JOHN
I hope you’ll be very happy
together

He’s getting up - restless suddenly wanting to be a long way
from Sherlock

SHERLOCK
I’m sorry what

JOHN
There are lives at stake Actual

SHERLOCK
Would caring help save them

No

No No

He’s gone to the window staring out Agitated doesn’t want
even to look at Sherlock

SHERLOCK
Youre disappointed in me

JOHN
Oh good Good deduction

A police tape has cordoned off most of the area

LESTRADE
You reckon this is connected then
The bomber

SHERLOCK
Must be

He pulls the pink iPhone from his pocket like he’s checking
it for messages

SHERLOCK (CONT’D)
Odd though he hasn’t been in
touch

LESTRADE
But we must assume some poor
bugger’s primed to explode yeah

SHERLOCK
Yes

Sherlock bends down and zips open the body bag He looks the
body up and down It’s a large middle-aged man

LESTRADE
Any ideas

SHERLOCK
Seven so far

LESTRADE
Seven

Sherlock’s suddenly all over the corpse like a blood-hound
sniffing pressing the cold skin unbuttoning clothes
rolling up the body’s trouser leg examining the wristwatch
tapping into his PDA

He examines the face with a lens and his eyes light up

At last he shoots a look at John jerks his head towards the
body then concentrates on sending texts

John looks to Lestrade for permission He shrugs Why not

JOHN
Dead about twenty four hours Maybe
a bit longer Did he drown

LESTRADE
Apparently not Not enough of the
Thames in his lungs Asphyxiated

JOHN
(nods )
Yes I’d agree There’s quite a bit
of bruising around the nose and
mouth

SHERLOCK
Yes There would be

JOHN
(gestures at the corpse’s
hairline and ears)
And there are more bruiseshere
and here

SHERLOCK
Fingertips

John shoots a look at him What does he know

JOHN
He’s mid-Fifties I’d say Not in
the best condition

SHERLOCK
He’s been in the river a while
which has destroyed most of the
data

His phone beeps He smiles

SHERLOCK (CONTD)
But I’11 tell you one thing
(nodding towards posters)
That lost Vermeer painting is a
fake

Beat

LESTRADE
What
SHERLOCK
We need to identify the corpse
Find out who his friends and
associates are -—

LESTRADE
Wait wait What painting What’re
you on about

SHERLOCK
(holds up his PDA)

It’s all over the place Haven’t
you seen the posters Dutch Old

Master It was supposed to have

been destroyed centuries ago and
now it’s turned up Worth thirty
million pounds

LESTRADE
Ok SoWhat’s that got to do
with the stiff

SHERLOCK
Everything
(excited)
Have you ever heard of the Golem

LESTRADE
Golem

JOHN
It’s a horror story isn’t it What
Are you saying

SHERLOCK

Jewish folk-story A gigantic man
made of clay It’s also the name of
an assassin Real name Oskar
Dzundza One of the deadliest
assassins in the world

(gestures at the corpse)
That’s his trademark style

LESTRADE
This was a hit

SHERLOCK
Definitely The Golem squeezes the
breath out of his victims with his
bare hands

LESTRADE
What’s this got to do with that
painting I don’t see -

SHERLOCK
You do see You just don’t observe

JOHN
(intervening)
All right girls Keep calm
Sherlock Wanna take us through it

Sherlock does He straightens up enjoying himself

listens

SHERLOCK
More likely That’d be borne out by
his backside

LESTRADE
His backside

SHERLOCK
Flabby You’d think he led a
sedentary life - yet the soles of
his feet and the nascent varicose
veins in his legs -

Track up from the corpse’s feet to show its callused soles
and veiny legs

SHERLOCK (CONTD)
- say otherwise So a lot of
walking and a lot of sitting
around Security guard’s looking
good

John smiles Pleased

SHERLOCK (CONTD)
And the watch helps The alarm —

Sherlock isolated All other details bleached out Examining
the watch as before ECU watch face showing 230 PM

SHERLOCK (CONTD)
- shows he did regular night
shifts

LESTRADE
Why regular Maybe he just set his
alarm like that the night before he
died

SHERLOCK
No no Buttons are stiff Hardly
touched He set the alarm like that
a long time ago His routine never
varied
But there’s something else Killer
must’ve been disturbed otherwise
he’d have stripped the corpse
completely There was some kind of
badge or insignia on the shirt
front that he tore off
Suggests the dead man worked
somewhere recognisable Some kind
of institution

He holds up a wet ball of paper

SHERLOCK (CONTD)
From his pocket Soaked by the
river but still recognisably —

JOHN

SHERLOCK
Ticket stubs He worked in a
museum Or a gallery

crouches in the shadows

His pursuer moves across the wooden floor

A huge shadow falls across his face
Alex looks up - terrified

ALEX
What have I done What have I -
Please For Gods sake -

rediscovered masterpiece

killer like the Golem to suffocate
a perfectly ordinary gallery
attendant Inference the dead man

knew something about it

from his hiding place

Yes We know all that

The recorded voice squeals as she fast-forwards it Images of
planets and stars blur over her face as she does so

VOICE
Titan is the largest moon -

Fast forwards again
PROFESSOR CAIRNS
Come on Neptune Where are you
hiding
She suddenly stops stiffens

PROFESSOR CAIRNS (CONT’D)

Hello

VOICE
Discovered by Urbain le Verrier in
1846 -

She stops the tape Peers about Her face is blue with the
image of Neptune

PROFESSOR CAIRNS
Tom Is that you

Someone is moving about in the darkness

PROFESSOR CAIRNS (CONT’D)
Tom

It’s not Tom A huge shadow falls across Professor Cairns’
face She gasps in terror as an immense hand closes over her
face swamping her nose and mouth THE GOLEM

She staggers back against the console
VOICE
A star begins as a collapsing ball
of material composed mainly of
hydrogen
She claws at the Golem’s hand --
Then --

SHERLOCK (0S)
Golem

Sherlock and John are revealed bathed in star-light

The Golem turns and at last we see

A nightmare face A living skeleton The Golem’s milk-white
bald head and deep-set eyes give him a vampire’s look The
skin is shrivelled dry as parchment He grins exposing
yellow peg-teeth

John raises his gun

VOICE
It is astonishing to think that
many of the stars in the night sky
are no longer actually there

The Golem lets go of Professor Cairns and she slides to the
floor dead The Golem giggles and darts into the shadows
His laughter echoes through the chilly building

VOICE (CONT’D)
Their light takes so long to reach
us that many are actually long
dead Exploded into supernovas

SHERLOCK
John

John runs to cut off the Golem There are rows and rows of
seats in the planetarium He knocks them up as he runs and
they bang like pistol shots

In the flickering projected light it’s almost impossible to
see where the Golem has gone

VOICE
The Crab Nebula exploded in 1054

SHERLOCK races down one aisle No sign of the Golem

He stops dead listening

Suddenly the projection changes and the Golem is revealed --
-- right behind Sherlock

His enormous hands close over Sherlock’s face like the petals
of a monstrous flower

On Sherlock gasping for breath He tries to get his hand
under the Golem’s fingers to pull them away from his flesh
but it’s no good

VOICE (CONT’D)
It is an example of what we call a
pulsar

On Sherlock eyes bulging in terror

SMACK

Suddenly the Golem sags as John smashes the back of his gun
over the Golem’s head Sherlock dives free rubbing his face
and whooping for air

Stunned the Golem swings round and jabs John savagely in the
guts He drops the gun Before John can recover the Golem
looms massively over him his hand closing over John’s face --

Click
Sherlock has John’s gun pointed at the Golem’s back

The Golem cocks his head and closes his fingers over John’s
mouth John starts to panic

Stand off

SHERLOCK
(deadly intent)
Let him go Or I’11 kill you
Dzundza I will kill you

The Golem releases John He scrabbles away towards Sherlock

SHERLOCK (CONTD)
You all right

JOHN

(gasping)
Think so

SHERLOCK
(to Golem)
Youll forgive the hoary cliche I
hope Mr Dzundza but who are you
working for

The Golem smiles horribly then suddenly sprints towards the
Planetarium’s control console Sherlock fires -- and hits the
console The recorded voice-over squeals madly into life the
projected images do the same Planets stars galaxies flash
insanely over the ceiling and their faces

VOICE
Their light takes so long to reach
us that many are actually long
dead Exploded into supernovas

The Golem takes advantage of the chaos and dives for the
exit Sherlock fires again but it’s too late A rectangle of
light as the Golem flings open the door and makes his escape

Sherlock runs to the doorway The screech of tyres from
outside

On John damn it

He holds out his PDA like a badge of honour showing it to
John and Miss Wenceslas

ON SCREEN A black and white photo of a large blobby white
star

SHERLOCK (CONTD)
The Van Buren supernova it’s
called A huge star blowing up
Only appeared in the sky in 1858

He holds the phone next to the Vermeer The same
configuration of stars has been painted in the sky over
Delft Including the blobby white Van Buren supernova

know how to go about convincing the

was just an idea A spark which he
blew into a flame

have a ticket So how did he end up
here Come on come on come on

He chews his lip Sighs No good He wanders back up the

onto the platform Then suddenly he turns back and gazes at
the railway

Close the points

On John He frowns Something occurs to him He grins
hugely

SHERLOCK (V0)
The points

JOHN
Yes

He whirls round The voice wasn’t in his head Sherlock is
standing above him on the platform smiling

SHERLOCK
I knew you’d get there West wasn’t
killed here That’s why there was
so little blood

competitive swimming pool ringed by old fashioned changing
rooms Very low light The water throws jagged shapes over
the walls Somewhere a door opens Footsteps

SHERLOCK’s gaze darts around the huge shadowy pool No sign
of life Just the soft slap of the water

carnation

It’s what the whole thing’s been
for isn’t it All your little

to distract me from this

Distantly another door opens and then bangs shut Sherlock
whirls round His expression is set determined

Footsteps on the tiled floor Sherlock peers ahead
Slowlyslowlya bulky figure resolves from the darkness

Then --

JOHN
‘Evening

On Sherlock What John
JOHN (CONTD)
This is a turn up isn’t it
Sherlock

John’s voice is strangely stilted halting

SHERLOCK
John What the hell are you -

JOHN
Bet you never saw this coming

On Sherlock impossible John

John comes closer He’s ashen-faced wearing a big bulky
overcoat

Then Sherlock sees it

A tiny red laser light dancing over John’s bulky coat Under
it explosives He also has an ear-piece He’s saying what’s
being fed to him And he’s scared

JOHN (CONTD)
What would you like me to make him
say next

On John sweat trickling down his face

JOHN (CONTD)
Gottle of geer Gottle of geer
Gottle -

Stop it

JOHN
Nice touch this The pool where
little Carl died

The laser point ranges over John’s chest He swallows
terrified

JOHN (CONTD)
I stopped him laughing I can stop
John Watson too Stop his heart

The laser settles above John’s heart

SHERLOCK
Who are you

A new voice echoes through room

JIM
I gave you my number Thought you
might call

And suddenly stepping from the shadows - the slight elfin
figure of JIM

JIM (CONTD)
Is that a British Army Browning
L9A1 in your pocket - or are you
just pleased to see me

Sherlock pulls John’s pistol from his coat Trains it on Jim

SHERLOCK

Beat

He holds out his hand smiles warmly Sherlock doesn’t
respond Jim looks disappointed

JIM (CONTD)
Jim From the hospital

He pulls a mock ‘sad’ expression

JIM (CONTD)
Really did I make such a fleeting
impression But then that was
rather the point

Sherlocks gaze flicks over to John The laser light is still
trained on him

JIM (CONTD)
Don’t be silly Someone else is
holding the rifle I don’t like
getting my hands dirty

Jims head moves slightly from side to side like a lizard’s

JIM (CONTD)
I’ve given you a glimpse Sherlock
Just a teensy glimpse of what I’ve
got going on out there in the big
bad world I’m a specialist you
see Like you
Jim grins

SHERLOCK
Dear Jim please could you fix it
for me to dispose of my boyfriend’s
nasty sister

youre in my way

Thank you

Didn’t mean it as a compliment

SHERLOCK
Yes you did

JIM
Yeah okay I did But the
flirting’s over Sherlock Daddys
had enough now I’ve shown you what
I can do I cut loose all those
people all those little problems
even thirty million quid just to
get you to come out and play Did
you like the Czech Republic thing
That’s what you might call a
leitmotif Had you going there
didn’t I But take this as a
friendly warning my dear Back
off

game of ours It’s been a treat

He prods at his eye and removes a contact lens His brown eye
is now blue

nod

The laser light still hovers over the explosives Sherlock

looks at his friend -- and thrusts out the memory stick
SHERLOCK
Take it
JIM

What Oh That Missile plans
Boring Could’ve picked them up any
time

Jim takes the memory stick from Sherlock and tosses it in the
pool

Sherlock moves forward instinctively John seizes on the
distraction rushes forward and throws his arms --

-- around Jim Now they’re both a bomb

JIM (CONTD)
Oh very good Very good

The laser light bobs confusedly over John’s body

JOHN
(hissing to Jim)
If your sniper pulls that trigger
Mr Moriarty we both go up

Jims head oscillates again He doesn’t resist John’s
embrace He is eerily calm

JIM

Isn’t he sweet I can see why you
like having him around But then
people do get so sentimental about
their pets

(to John)
So touchingly loyal But - oops -
youve rather shown your hand
there Dr Watson

He nods towards the gallery The laser lights moves off John
and settles on Sherlocks temple

JIM (CONTD)
Gotcha

A new stand-off Sherlock with the pistol trained on Jim The
explosives-festooned John with his arms wrapped around Jim
The sniper’s rifle threatening Sherlock

On John defeated Slowly he lets Jim go and steps aside
The laser light moves back onto John’s body

Jim straightens his suit

JIM (CONTD)

He beams at Sherlock

JIM (CONTD)
Do you know what happens if you
don’t leave me alone Sherlock To
you

SHERLOCK
Oh let me guess I’11 be killed

JIM
Killed nah don’t be obvious I
mean I’m gonna kill you anyway
some day - don’t want to rush it
though saving it up for something
special No if you don’t stop
prying I will burn you I will
burn the heart out of you

SHERLOCK
I am reliably informed I don’t have
one

JIM
But we both know that’s not quite
true

On Sherlock impassive

JIM (CONTD)
Well I’d better be off So nice to
have a proper chat

SHERLOCK
What if I were to shoot you now
Right now

JIM
Then you could cherish the look of
surprise on my face Because I
would be surprised Sherlock
Really I would And just a teensy
bit disappointed ‘Course you
wouldn’t be able to cherish it for
very long

He gives a cheerful wave

JIM (CONTD)
Ciao Sherlock Holmes

-- and melts away into the shadows
SHERLOCK
(calling)
Catch youlater

Jim calls without turning

JIM
No You wont

He goes The door bangs behind him Sherlock stares at John
John stares back Then suddenly the red laser -- winks out

Sherlock races up to John -

SHERLOCK
Alright You alright

- rips off the overcoat tears the explosive from around him -

JOHN
Yeah Yeah I’m fine I’m fine
Sherlock -

Sherlock manically strips the explosives and hurls them away

JOHN (CONTD)

Sherlock stops dead

JOHN (CONTD)

Sherlock races off throws open the door

Sherlock glances at John a bit uncomfortably

SHERLOCK (CONTD)

John shrugs John gazes down at his ragged clothes

JOHN
Glad no-one saw that
SHERLOCK
Hm
JOHN

You ripping all my clothes off ina
darkened swimming pool People
might talk

SHERLOCK
They do little else

They look at each other A small smile
Then suddenly Another laser light winks into life on John
Then one on Sherlock Then another and another and another
until both men are covered in tiny bobbing red lights
JIM (0S)
Sorry boys I am so changeable
It’s a weakness with me But to be
fair it’s my only weakness
Jim is upstairs in the gallery half-glimpsed
JIM (CONTD)
You can’t be allowed to continue
You just can’t
(sighs)
I would try to convince you
buteverything I have to say has
already crossed your mind
Sherlock looks over at John
A moment between them
John nods

Then Sherlock aims his gun at the massive pile of Semtex he’s
just taken off John

SHERLOCK
Then possibly my answer has crossed
yours

Close Countless laser sights hovering over Sherlock and
John

John a soldier alert to every move
Jim a tiny smile
Sherlock totally focussed Hand steady as a rock

He cocks the gun
