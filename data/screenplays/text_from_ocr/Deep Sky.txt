DEEP SKY

by Matt Johnson
FADE IN

OUTER SPACE

We’re looking at EARTH from 50000 miles out An enormous
blue and white ball pulsing in black space It’s the classic
image We’ve seen it a million times

But then something new catches our eye

White shapes above the planet Hundreds of them like an
armada of miniature stars circling the globe

They are SPACE STATIONS

All shapes and sizes Under all stages of construction
Smaller craft dart among them like errant fireflies

OFF SCREEN VOICE
(filtered)
Thirty seconds

A HEADS-UP DISPLAY (HUD)

frames our vision a see-through instrument panel giving us
indicators for things like Pitch Yaw Thrust

Then we look down At our boots
We’re standing on the titanium skeleton of a--
SPACE STATION UNDER CONSTRUCTION

A gigantic erector set of beams and girders stretching
hundreds of stories beneath us

It gives “vertigo” a new meaning

VAL DALTON is the man wearing the boots standing on the giant
alloy frame His black form-fitted PRESSURE SUIT with
integrated life support and propulsion systems make him as
much spaceship as spaceman

Through the visor of his helmet the helmet we were looking
out of before we can see his face illumined by the glowing
HUD He looks down He focuses on something--

An OBJECT far below moving steadily up the side of the
station A flickering green light moving with it

OFF SCREEN VOICE (CONTD)

(filtered)
Fifteen seconds

( )
Val glances at his partner
JARRETT REED

Tethered to Val Jarrett aims something the size of a small
flashlight a LIGHT TOOL at the approaching object

Val pulls a GRAPPLE GUN from his utility harness

OFF SCREEN VOICE (CONTD)
(filtered)
Ten seconds

The object’s getting closer It’s a DRONE LIFT - the mid-23rd
century’s version of a construction elevator - towing a large
ANTENNA DISH The lift is connected to the station only by
flickering patterns of GREEN LASER LIGHT that guide it upward

OFF SCREEN VOICE (CONTD)
(filtered)
Five

Jarrett’s light tool fires He swipes it across his glove --
and his entire suit GLOWS GREEN He turns and passes the tool
across Val’s glove Val’s suit lights up to match

Both men stand ready glowing green to match the approaching
laser light show dwarfed by the enormous structure reaching
above and below them a big bad moon rising behind him

They’re the coolest two astronauts you’ve ever seen

OFF SCREEN VOICE (CONTD)
(filtered)
Three two one

The lift arrives Val FIRES his gun The grapple FUSES to
the antenna dish and Val and Jarrett are YANKED off the
station and onto the moving lift their suits conducting the
laser light allowing them to pass through the beams without
breaking them

Val holds onto the grapple tether with one hand dangling in
space off the back of the lift

VAL
We’re on

OFF SCREEN VOICE

(filtered)
You got two minutes

( )
Val pulls them onto the dish They each clip themselves to it
as the massive station moves past them at a tremendous rate

JARRETT unscrews a panel from the face of the dish

VAL inserts a laser cutting wand into the opening Flashes of
blue light discharge deep in the innards of the antenna

VALS POV His gloved hands work smoothly to detach his prize
- a component inlaid with big yellow crystals

OFF SCREEN VOICE (CONT’D)
(filtered)
Get a move on guys

Jarrett looks at the small PORTHOLES on a completed section of
space station awaiting the arrival of the lift and its cargo
The portholes are rapidly getting closer

Jarrett checks on Val

VALS POV The component is almost detached when suddenly
Val’s HUDSHORTS OUT

His suit GOES DARK and the green laser beams BREAK across his
body Val looks at Jarrett sees his mouth open in a silent
YELL Then Val’s HUD flicks back on A RED WARNING LIGHT
flashes Sound now matches Jarrett’s moving mouth

JARRETT
--Stumpers Abort Abort

Jarrett unclips from the dish drifts out waiting for Val
OFF SCREEN VOICE
(filtered)

Get outta there I got readings all

over the place
Val looks down to see--
A MASS OF WHAT LOOK LIKE SMALL METALLIC BIRDS
--SWARMING up from below seemingly from out of nowhere

These are STUMPERS - mean nasty robotic “guard dogs”

Val yanks a standard crescent wrench from his harness and
monkeys it into the dish

JARRETT
Val Forget it Leave it

( )
Val works the wrench reaches in with his other hand

OFF SCREEN VOICE
(filtered)
Get out get out They’re all over
you

»and PULLS OUT the component Val unclips and throws
Jarrett a quick “thumbs up”

There is a BRIGHT flash from Jarrett’s THRUSTER PACK and he
TAKES OFF straight out from the space station Val is JERKED
along on the tether Both men rocket away into space

Val looks back

As the space station rapidly recedes the robotic Stumpers
BUZZING the lift just missing their prey

OFF SCREEN VOICE (CONTD)
(filtered)
We got visual You’re clear

The thruster cuts out Jarrett pulls a release and the empty
pack spirals away into space just as a small SPACECRAFT
maneuvers into position above them It’s a nondescript beat-
up utilitarian “HAULER” -- the Ford Econoline Van of the
inner solar system

Val unhooks the tether between Jarrett and himself -- then
fires his BOOT THRUSTERS Propellant pushes him forward

JARRETT
Open the airlock Kellogg

Val streams headfirst towards the hauler as the outer airlock
doors open He pulls his legs to his chest and coasts into--

THE HAULER AIRLOCK

Val grabs a handhold and jerks to a stop He glares through a
thick window at KELLOGG spindly Iggy Pop-looks standing on

the other side His is the filtered voice we’ve been hearing

0S Now it sounds defensive

KELLOGG
(filtered)
You watched me run the suit before we
took off Val It checked out

Val glares at Kellogg as Jarrett enters the air lock The
outer doors close There is a loud HISSING as repressurizing
commences
INT HAULER CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
Val walks after a hastily retreating Kellogg

KELLOGG
I don’t know what happened I’11
tear it down soon as we get home

Val pulls off his helmet giving us a clear look at his face -
young handsome containedbut mad

VAL
How about right now Outside Take
your time Rest of us’1ll go on home
send someone back for you tomorrow

Jarrett walks up -- he’s ten years Val’s senior cowboy-jawed
steely-eyed Calmer wiser Settled is more like it

KELLOGG
You know Jarrett Val ought to show
his tech man a little respect

Jarrett holds up the stolen dish component

JARRETT
He just made us one point two
Sounds respectful to me

Val grins and lights a cigarette Kellogg shakes his head
disgruntled turns and heads towards the bridge Val starts
after him but Jarrett lays a firm hand on his shoulder

JARRETT (CONTD)
Next time I call abort and you feel
like sticking around I’m leaving
without you

Val grins through his cigarette

VAL
Promise

INT HAULER BRIDGE

Val straps into his seat cigarette dangling from his mouth
Jarrett takes a seat across from him as Kellogg buckles in
shotgun ANDERS the young pilot takes the wheel

ANDERS

Val takes a big drag on his cigarette and holds the smoke in
his lungs as he grinds the butt into the wall behind him

ANDERS (CONT’D)
Five four three two one burn

EXT THE HAULER

The rocket ports on the back of the ship FLARE The hauler

As the G’s press him into his seat Val exhales the cigarette
smoke in a long steady stream

Jarrett shakes his head trying not to smile Val grins No
hard feelings between these two

slaps as slides into the booth

VAL

Mullins shrugs like it wasn’t much

( )
MULLINS
Climbed the ice cliffs below Mount
Olympus Got laid Twice

KELLOGG
That’s twice more than Jarrett in as
many years

Mullins cracks a shit-eating grin Val offers him a smoke

VAL
You ready to go back to work

Mullins takes the cigarette gets serious

MULLINS

Val leans in lowers his voice

VAL
Dry dock gig V-Class shuttle

JARRETT
On the sly Cool and by the numbers

VAL
Mess with their heads pick their
pockets Chop shop’s dark side

KELLOGG
You really expect Anders to land a V-
Class on the dark side

ANDERS
Id tell you how many times I’ve
flown over Darkness if I thought you
could count that high
Kellogg laughs at the ball-breaking Val looks at Mullins

VAL
Want the job

MULLINS
(grins)
Got nothing else planned
Val lifts his glass in salute
VAL

Here’s to crime that pays

( )
They all drink up
INT SURFACE TRAM - LCC

The moon’s commuter train Packed with workers and white
collars in a collective day’s-end trance

Touches a sensor that produces a small HOLOGRAPHIC JARRETT

VAL
Yeah

JARRETT

VAL
What’s goin’ on

JARRETT
Tycho Brae wants to meet

( )
VAL
(surprised)
Both of us

JARRETT
That’s what he said Twenty minutes

Jarrett’s holograph disappears Val gets up

EXT AGRIDOME - LCC

Two thousand acres of farmland under a translucent dome

INT AGRIDOME —- LCC

Val and Jarrett stand in the middle of an enormous field of
crops growing in synthetic soil A solitary artificial rain
cloud moves low over the field watering it a row at a time

Two men approach from across the field

The taller one is TYCHO BRAE interplanetary boss Close to
Jarrett’s age but more refined and sophisticated A man in
complete control of everything and everyone around him

TYCHO BRAE
Jarrett Val

Brae motions to the other man -- NIGEL slightly younger a
look of pronounced indifference on his face

TYCHO BRAE (CONTD)
Val this is Nigel Nigel takes care
of business for me when I’m unable
tomuch the same as Jarrett used to
do before our situations changed--

JARRETT
What do you want Brae

Brae pauses like he’s refraining from lobbing an insult

TYCHO BRAE
I want to offer you a job

JARRETT
You know the deal We get five
hundred to put the suits on extra
five if it’s dry-dock work--

TYCHO BRAE
This job pays twenty Million

( )

Jarrett’s stunned Val doesn’t miss a beat

VAL
What is it

Brae directs his attention to Val

TYCHO BRAE
Freighter payload
VAL
Class
TYCHO BRAE

Light Speed
This stops Val for a beat Jarrett squints

JARRETT
Is it in dry dock

TYCHO BRAE
No

JARRETT
It’s in a surface hangar

TYCHO BRAE
Huh-uh

Jarrett looks stumped but Val gets it right away
VAL
(cool)
You want us to hit it in-flight

Brae gleams

TYCHO BRAE
Yes

JARRETT
Youre kidding

TYCHO BRAE
Off Mars Coast while it’s in-bound
at sub-light velocity of course

VAL
No he’s not

( )
TYCHO BRAE
Fifteen million credits plus another
five in mining options if you deliver
the payload completely intact

JARRETT
What’s the payload

A beat Then a smug grin winds across Brae’s face

VAL
The ship’s the payload isn’t it

Brae nods at Val impressed

BRAE
This is one sharp apprentice you’ve
got Jarrett

JARRETT
Youre out of your mind

TYCHO BRAE
I know I can’t help it The whole
idea makes me crazy

JARRETT
Hijack a Light Speed Freighter

TYCHO BRAE
Hijack and steal

JARRETT
That’s never been done

TYCHO BRAE
The entire history of mankind is one
continuous refutation of that
statement You should know better
at your age

Jarrett doesn’t react

TYCHO BRAE (CONTD)
Forgive me for the ass-kissing but
you’re the best crew for the job
The launch window opens in sixty
days the offer’s good for
fortybut I’d prefer not to cut it
so close

JARRETT
You already have our answer

( )
Brae shakes his head

TYCHO BRAE
Come on Jarrett Take a smoke
break Life’s too short

JARRETT
Gets a lot shorter if you drop the
ball in zero-g

Brae smiles at Jarrett

TYCHO BRAE
Always loved how you dare to dream
(glances at Val)
Forty days twenty million Roll
those numbers around and call me

Brae turns and leaves Nigel follows
INT SURFACE TRAM - LCC
Val and Jarrett have the tram to themselves

VAL
We should do this

JARRETT
Last time I did a big job with Brae
I spent the next three years of my
life in the Arctic Prison

VAL
That was ten years agoyou’ve
pulled jobs for him since

JARRETT
Five hundred grand is a job fifteen
million is a whole different thing

VAL
Twenty

JARRETT
We’re not doing this Val

VAL
But we could do this

Jarrett looks at Val dead serious cutting him off

( )

JARRETT
Things are good for us right now We
have it down I’m not pissing it
away on some rodeo ride for Brae
The tram stops

JARRETT (CONT’D)
It’s cold in the Arctic Prison

Jarrett steps off The tram starts
Val watches him disappear as the tram SPEEDS AWAY
INT CESTUS CLUB - LCC

Dim lighting Hints of movement something open and sexual
going on in the shadows

Val enters and heads for the bar A bald man with a head full
of tats face pierced like a pin-cushion and a boa
constrictor draped over one shoulder puts a drink in front of
him One or two other creepy characters nod to Val

It’s obvious he’s a regular

Val lights a cigarette takes a swig of his drink

ADRIENNE 20s beautiful cold as metal lips like black rose
petals takes a seat next to him She runs a hand through his

hair gives hima kiss

ADRIENNE
Ready baby

Val downs his drink They both get up
INT ADRIENNE’S ROOM - CESTUS CLUB

Val lies back on a large round cushion drifting in the
sleepy early stages of a blissful intoxication

VAL
Last job took us close closest I’ve
been in a while

Adrienne comes over to him leans down

ADRIENNE
Look up

( )

»and squeezes a dropper into one of his eyes She floods
his eyeball with a clear liquid then does the same to the
other Val blinks Adrienne moves away

VAL
The whole thing was right beneath me
I could pick out the Indian Ocean I
could taste the spray Tasted like
my childhood

Adrienne reappears and hands Val a small vial of neon blue
liquid He dabs it onto his tongue and hands it back

VAL (CONTD)
I’m going back someday Adrienne

ADRIENNE
You’re going back right now

VAL
For real

The lights go down Val looks around It’s a look of peace

VAL (CONTD)
I’m going to sail the ocean

We hear the SOUNDS of the ocean

VALS POV The boundaries of the room have given way to
TROPICAL SKIES and swelling OCEAN WAVES as if Val was riding
on a boat through high seas

Adrienne reappears She is naked skin shining through a thin
sheen of body oil She walks to Val over the “water” lays
down next to him starts to undress him

CLOSE ON VAL’S FACE as he enjoys his hallucination

VAL (CONTD)
I’m gonna sail the Earth

As Adrienne slowly climbs on top of him the room looks black
and empty as before

Only Val can see the ocean
CUT TO

MAGNIFIED POV EARTH - the South Pacific Ocean to be precise

INT OBSERVATORY —- LCC

People mostly parents and children sit around the room in
comfortable VIEWING STATIONS looking at their selected
telescopic images on thin computer monitors

Val sits alone staring at his ocean when a HAND touches his
arm He looks up to see Nigel standing above him

VAL
What do you want

NIGEL
To talk

VAL
Go ahead

NIGEL
Not me

Val suddenly swoons under a wave of nausea

VALS POV Nigel becomes fuzzy almost glazed over He holds
up his hand to reveal a small PATCH on his finger He has
drugged Val

NIGEL (CONTD)
Let’s take a ride

Val falls into an immediate physical torpor He’s powerless
to resist He talks like someone shot full of Novocaine

flag Neil and Buzz’s footprints scattered in the dust

One giant leap preserved under a glass dome

Val sits in a front row seat waking up out of the drug Brae
and Nigel stand in front of him Val gets his bearings stands
up and PUNCHES Nigel in the face

Nigel barely flinches Grabs his nose and stares blankly at
Val as blood runs over his fingers

TYCHO BRAE
Go wipe yourself

Nigel leaves Brae offers Val a cigarette

TYCHO BRAE (CONTD)
Smoke

Val ignores him

VAL
Your monkey said you wanted to talk

Brae puts the cigarettes away

TYCHO BRAE
You’ve been working with Jarrett for
a while now haven’t you

VAL
Since right after he finished doing
time for you

Brae laughs
TYCHO BRAE
Is that how he tells it What that

I left him hanging in the wind That
I even set him up maybe

( )

VAL
Something like that

TYCHO BRAE
But never that he just choked on the

first real opportunity that came his
way

Val doesn’t respond
TYCHO BRAE (CONTD)

Tell me something Val How many real
opportunities has Jarrett handed you

Val bites his tongue

VAL
He saved my life

TYCHO BRAE
That’s a start

VAL
Taught me everything I know

TYCHO BRAE
And I him

Val doesn’t continue Brae lets the silence hang
TYCHO BRAE (CONTD)
You could take the freighter
couldn’t you

VAL
I don’t work alone--

Brae interrupts pushing the question
TYCHO BRAE
But one could take the Light Speed
Freighter I mean you do agree with
me that it could be done
Val’s quiet for a second Then
VAL
With the right crew anything’s
possible

Brae nods his head

( )

TYCHO BRAE
That’s what I like about you Val
You’re a man of vision Just like
me You see inpossibilities
Val stares hard at Brae
VAL
Quitting Jarrett to work for you
isn’t one of them Jarrett’s family
I don’t walk away from that
Brae ponders Val for a second then speaks softly
TYCHO BRAE
Our entire universe is expanding as
we speak A continuous never-ending
explosion You and I are pieces of
stars Val Infinity is now
He pauses one last time then smiles

TYCHO BRAE (CONTD)
Only a fool tries to go again it

KELLOGG’S FACE appears in the middle of the portrait

KELLOGG

It’s me

Kelloggs face disappears from the portrait The door slides
open and he enters the room

KELLOGG (CONTD)
No good They took him off-moon two
hours ago Be at least a week before
his arraignment

Val turns to Jarrett

VAL
Then we decide right now

Silence
KELLOGG

Where are we gonna get another pilot
this quick

JARRETT
Gifford can hook us up It’1ll cost
us--

MULLINS

Well take it off the pilot’s end
Everyone looks at Jarrett

KELLOGG
I need this job man

( )

Jarrett remains stone-faced through a long heavy silence
Then he turns to Val

JARRETT
Call Gifford and set it up

Jarrett looks at the others

JARRETT (CONT’D)
I need this job too

INT PRESSURIZATION PLANT

A steam-filled labyrinth of ducts and pipes A loud HISSING

Val and Jarrett stand together waiting

A FIGURE EMERGES from the steam A man in a black coat As
he gets closer we see that his chin and lips are one big
recent scar like someone tried to pry open his mouth with a
shovel This is GIFFORD interstellar scum-bag

GIFFORD
Nice to see you boys slumming again

VAL
(referring to the
scars)
Didn’t have to get all prettied up
just for us

GIFFORD
Goddamn Stumper tried to give me a
rhinoplasty Fuckin’ things are
swarming my nightmares --

JARRETT
Where’s our pilot

Gifford’s miffed at Jarrett for interrupting

GIFFORD
Making sure you’re not cops

He waves to someone behind him and smiles

GIFFORD (CONT’D)
You guys are gonna like Lester

Another figure emerges from the steam

This one is a woman

( )

LESTER RILEY Tall young and beautiful Strong and lithe
Deep piercing eyes Sex snared in body armor

GIFFORD (CONT’D)
Lester meet the boys

The men are surprised They obviously weren’t expecting a
woman much less a gorgeous one

VAL
(to Gifford)
“Lester”

Lester nails Val with a hard stare

LESTER
What’s wrong Never saw a pilot
wearing pants you wanted into

Val’s caught out by the attitudebut likes it

VAL
Think I was just expecting
someoneshorter

LESTER
I heard you Earth-system guys were
small time but I thought that was
about balls not brains

Gifford snorts a snot-drenched laugh
VAL

Nothing small here sister We’re
running a big toy to the dark side

LESTER
If it’s got a stick I can handle it
Val laughs
VAL
Let me guess not a cockpit you can’t
fit
LESTER

Something like that

VAL
Well if you fly as good as you talk
we might have to take you on

She walks right up to him looks him straight in the eye

( )

LESTER
Are you Jarrett

Val grins cocky holds out his hand

VAL
I’m Val

She doesn’t take it

LESTER
Then I’m wasting my time

Val frowns at the put-down Jarrett steps forward

JARRETT
I’m Jarrett

Lester turns to him extends her hand

LESTER
Lester Riley I thought this was a
done deal

JARRETT
Word is you last worked outer system
pulled a big job off Triton Coast
with the Gates brothers

LESTER
I flew for Billy for six months

JARRETT
Why’d you leave

LESTER
It was alanguage thing

JARRETT
What’s that

LESTER
Well see Billy speaks English fine
but he doesn’t understand it too
well I used the word “No” several
times one night and maybe it’s just
me or maybe it’s all that reefer
Billy smokes but I had to stab him
through the hand so he could hear
better That dissolved our
partnership

Jarrett nods grins

( )

JARRETT
Language thing

VAL
Poor Billy

LESTER
Interview over

JARRETT
Still want the job

LESTER
Long as you understand that while
were in-flight and I’m at the stick
my word goes until engine shutdown
I call the shots while we’re pulling
Gs End of discussion

Val burns But Jarrett doesn’t flinch

JARRETT
No problem there Long as you
understand that if you so much as
fantasize about calling shots after
engine shutdown I will put a bullet
through your skull without feeling
bad Far as discussion’s concerned
Ill go ahead and shoot you now if
you object

Lester gives Jarrett a million dollar grin

LESTER
You got yourself a wheel man

Jarrett smiles back He can’t take his eyes off of
notices and doesn’t like it

VAL
Then how about we cut short this love-
in and go steal ourselves a

Rolling hills pockmarked with a thousand craters baking in
the 225 degree Fahrenheit heat of the bright lunar noon

A single LUNAR TRUCK crawls a well-worn path in the dust
Flickering blue laser light patterns dance around its boxy
freight container

Hunched behind the large boulders lining the rim areFOUR
MEN in pressure suits

One of them is VAL Another one is GIFFORD The other TWO
are jumpy and anxious low-rent lunar BIKER types They watch
the truck make its way along the trail below Behind them
rests a MOON SCOOTER -- a small open vehicle for short hops

Val aims a light-tool down at the truck It lights up He
swipes it across his glove -- his suit sparkles blue

Val turns to Gifford

VAL
Wait for me to stop it before you
make your move

BIKER ONE speaks up

I don’t care if you are running this
show you mess up out there you’re

smirks He and Biker Two move for the scooter Val shoots a
glare at Gifford

Don’t worry They won’t screw the
pooch

Best for you they don’t

across the surface towards the truck

Val slows as he approaches the truck then passes successfully
through the blue laser alarm

He hovers for a second then drops gently onto the container
engulfed in a staccato explosion of the blue light

He pulls a tool from his suit and opens up a control panel on
the back of the truck After a few seconds of fiddling the
laser light SHUTS OFF

The truck comes to a quick HALT Val looks forward

The SCOOTER skims up to the truck with Gifford at the stick
Biker One and Biker Two leap off and reach the cab of the
truck in two quick bounds

Val starts to work his way to the freight door when--

Open up

Val turns and looks as BIKER ONE pastes a small lump of clay
to the cab’s hatch

VAL
Hey

There is a bright FLASH as the hatch FLIES off the truck
The two DRIVERS are sucked out in the escaping atmosphere
Their bodies explode in the vacuum and scatter in shreds to
the surface

Biker One jumps to the top of the cab

VAL (CONTD)
That’s “Murder One” asshole

Biker One pulls a LASER TORCH from his tool belt

BIKER ONE
No That’s murder one two three--

( )

He flicks the torch on White laser light streams from its
tip HE SLASHES it towards Val

Val leaps up and pulls something off his belt
It’s a zero-g modified double-barrel sawed-off SHOTGUN
He levels it at Biker One and pulls the trigger

MUZZLE FLASH erupts and Biker One’s helmet EXPLODES in a
frothy spray of blood and brains

The recoil ROCKETS Val backwards across the container He
spots Biker Two going for the laser torch and lets him have
the second shotgun barrel

Biker Two is CUT IN HALF at the waist -- his bisected body
halves spin apart in opposite directions

The laser torch drops to the container and clicks ON A white-

hot beam of light begins to BURN through a round case near the
cab of the truck

The case bears the universal warning label for RADIATION

He casts a quick glance at Val then--

HOPS BACK ONTO THE SCOOTER and hits the gas The scooter
TAKES OFF leaving Val behind

Val LEAPS from the container firing his thrusters at the same
time and--

SHOOTS ACROSS THE GAP TO THE SCOOTER

Makes the grab onto the back of the flying machine just as
Gifford tries to escape

An enormous bright FLASH goes off behind them as the lunar
truck’s reactor explodes

Val gains his footing Gifford looks over his shoulder in
fear He PITCHES the scooter in an attempt to shake Val off

Val holds on with one hand pulls his grapple gun with the
other and points it at Gifford

VAL

Stumpers anymore Gif

Val FIRES The grapple TEARS into Gifford’s chest rupturing
his pressure suit

Gifford’s face registers a look of horrorThen EXPLODES ALL

light inside the hologram highlights what Val says

We’1l land the docking pod onto the
mass driver hitch a ride to the
point of intersection then bail off
and drop onto the freighter as it
passes underneath us

It looks impossible The others watch gravely serious

something across the room

Its a pack of CIGARETTES protruding from the pocket of a

something at the security station forces him to look

Its a flat MONITOR -- displaying a FLOOR PLAN of the Deck

Far across the room near the top behind a small gangway is

Val hits his thrusters and heads for the lifeboat gangway

He sets the timer on his last grenade for 0015 and loads it
into the launcher tube on the Z-16 as he goes

He approaches the edge of the gangway and slows when--

LESTER rushes out of nowhere to meet him

Val tries to react but gets the butt of Lesters machine gun
SMASHED into his visor The Z-16 SPIRALS out of his hands as
he TUMBLES away from the lifeboat

Lester pushes off after him levels her machine gun and OPENS
FIRE -- but the RECOIL knocks her reeling head over heels
backwards

VAL stops his tumble and looks up

HIS GUN floats way above near the top of the engine room
Val FIRES HIS THRUSTERS and heads for it

LESTER catches her fall and BLASTS after Val

Val reaches for his gun Lester COLLIDES with him He
doesnt make the grab They both CAREEN into the wall

Lester pins him and GRABS for his kill switch He DODGES
then PUNCHES her in the helmet The blow sends them REELING
until Vals harness--

SNAGS on the top of one of the ANTIMATTER ENGINE TOWERS

He tries to use THRUST to break free but Lester SWOOPS down on
him and PULLS HIS KILL SWITCH

His thrusters cut out gone

HOSE into his helmet

EXT ANTENORA
The lifeboat SPIRALS up and away at a fantastic speed
INT ENGINE ROOM

Lester BURSTS INTO FLAMES as the ENGINES IGNITE

INT LIFEBOAT SHUTTLE

Val is pinned to the floor of the shuttle his face rippling
with the tremendous acceleration He uses all his strength to
crane his neck back so he can see out the window

VALS POV The Antenoras rocket ports FLARE and the massive
ship disappears in a thin crack of LIGHT

INT BRIDGE - ANTENORA

Brae watches the smeared tunnel of light-speed light through
the cockpit window His face is gleeful

BRAE
Speed

THE FUSION GRENADE timer clicks over to 0000
EXT INTERPLANETARY SPACE
The lifeboat shuttle soars upwards as a--

BLINDING MULTICOLORED WAVE OF LIGHT splits space like a
thunderbolt from Zeus

INT LIFEBOAT SHUTTLE

Val strains against the G’s to see the Antenora go Supernova
three seconds and 558000 miles away from him in space

VAL
Heres to eternity

The light RIPPLES across Vals entire field of vision

Then disappears

INT LIFEBOAT SHUTTLE - LATER

Quiet now

Val sits half-undressed on the floor bio-med sensors taped to
his bare chest He smokes a cigarette and stares listlessly
out the window at the vast blackness of space

VAL - LATER STILL

He lowers himself into a SLEEP CHAMBER and opens a small vial
of the same neon blue liquid he drank in the Cestus Club He

sips it back and tosses the vial out of the sleep chamber

CLOSE ON - VALS FACE as he drifts off to sleep

( )
DISSOLVE TO BLACK SCREEN
We hear a loud WHISTLING sound Like a bomb falling
CLOSE ON - VALS FACE

A thick matted beard now covers it He jolts awake and looks
around alarmed

INT LIFEBOAT SHUTTLE

The craft violently ROCKS and SHUDDERS The instrument panel
wet with condensation SPARKS and SMOKES

Val looks out the window to see only BURNING HOT FLAME

The ROCKING grows increasingly violent Then SUDDENLY--

It STOPS All is calm as bright SUNLIGHT floods the shuttle
Val looks out again

VALS POV A large vast body of WATER is visible below

It is THE PACIFIC OCEAN Val is rushing towards EARTH

EXT LIFEBOAT

Parachutes break the lifeboats fall as it SPLASHES DOWN
EXT EARTH - SOUTH PACIFIC OCEAN

The small charred craft ROCKS and PITCHES on the blue water
supported by an inflatable ring around its base

The hatch OPENS and VAL climbs out He feels the air on his
face He breathes in a deep breath of sea-salt

There is nothing but water for as far as he can see

He squints at the horizon for a long time in complete and
utter disbelief Then he smiles

THE LIFEBOAT SHUTTLE - FROM ABOVE

Val stretches out across the top of the spaceship lights a
cigarette and leans back to catch the bright sunshine as he
sails the Earth

FADE OUT

THE END
