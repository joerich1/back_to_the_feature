INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Ed lies awake in bed He is sweaty and nervous His eyes are wide-
open blood-shot and tired

He picks up his bedside clock which is ticking loudly It is 337

He looks over at the other side of the

queen-size bed It is still made He picks a long blonde hair from
the

pillow and examines it curiously

There is a noise outside and Ed gets up to investigate

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Ed walks through the dark hallway and into the living room of his
small house

INT LIVING ROOM

By the front door hanging on the wall is a
framed picture of Eve Eds wife Ed passes by it and looks outside
through the window There is some wind outside but nothing else

INT BATHROOM

Ed looks longingly at his reflection Ed Saxon

45 is a morbid insecure man His frustration with his life has
tinged

his sense of humor with an acerbic bite His early success a few
publications of his poetry has given him a professorship at the
University He is well-read intelligent a bit pompous and
occasionally condescending But mostly these qualities are restrained
and his outward appearance is a little sorrowful There is an
unquestionable charm about him and its effect is evident in the
people

around him

He searches through the medicine cabinet which
is full of womens items and takes out a Cosco-sized bottle of
sleeping pills He reads the back and takes two

He hears something bang against the front door

INT LIVING ROOM

He opens the front door and takes a step outside

EXT PORCH - NIGHT

He looks down by his feet and finds the morning
paper wrapped in blue plastic lying on the doormat He picks it up
and goes back inside

INT LIVING ROOM

Ed stands helplessly in the empty living room

Eds desk sits on one side of the living room

crammed into the corner He searches quickly through the stuff on the
desk and finds a small address book He finds a name in the book and
dials the number

INT BATHROOM

Ed takes the sleeping pills from the medicine cabinet and takes two

INT HALLWAY

Eve has a small room in the house that Ed is
cautious about entering He walks in and looks around as if he hasnt
been in there for a while

INT EVES ROOM

The room is painted sky-blue and the ceiling has clouds painted on it
On one side of the room there is a console piano with some sheet
music resting on it

On the other side of the room is a small

antique writing desk Ed sits down and looks at some of the items
lying

on it There are a couple of letters and an address book There is a
box containing paper clips etc There is an open box of Skin-EE(
cookies

There is a drawer in the desk which he tries to

open but finds that it is locked He searches around the desk for a
key but can find one He presses a little harder at the drawer but
it wont budge He takes a letter opener from a jar on the desk and
starts to fidget with it but he still cant open it

Then he hears some distant voices coming from

outside He looks out the window where he can see the house next door
There is a light on in the neighbors window where the voices are
coming from and some vague shadows move around inside Ed turns off
the lights in Eves room so that he can see more clearly

From the muffled sounds it is soon clear that the couple next door is
having an argument

Only the womans voice is clear

WOMAN

I hate you Stay away from me Dont touch me Just go
to sleep Ill scream I am not screaming now You dont know anything
about me

Then the noise dies down and the woman can be heard sobbing in the
distance

head by one of the perpetrators and then wandered away from the
incident in a daze Nobodys seen her since When I got the call on

driving a Pathfinder and was wearing jeans so it probably wasnt her

sits at his desk and picks up a pile of his students papers He reads
the one on top marking it with a red pen as he does

He hears a gurgling noise coming quietly from the bathroom He gets
up and walks into the-

INT BATHROOM

He looks around the bathroom tracing the sound

to the bathtub drain It gets louder as he approaches it but before
he

can investigate there is a knock on the front door

outside

The sun is streaming in through the windows

Through the washed-out sunlight outside his window Ed can see a

car parked in front of his house

Someone knocks again and Ed answers the door
As he does he picks up the mail that has been dropped through the

slot
in the door

passed out Her pants are around her knees as if she passed out while
standing up from the toilet

Her nose is bleeding like she might have hit it on the way down It
has bled on her sweater

The air from the open door wakes her up but she is in a heavy daze

ED

Are you alright My God What happened

ED

Can you stand Do you understand me Ill help you to the bedroom
Sadie notices her pants are down

INT BATHROOM

Ed looks at the tub in the bathroom which is full of water

He sticks his finger deep into the drain trying
to free whatever is in there There is another tuft of hair and again
he throws it into the toilet

The gurgling sound that he heard before has come back resonating
through the soapy water from the drain

INT BASEMENT

Ed follows the gurgling sounds into the basement

He takes a flashlight from behind the basement

door and shines it at the pipes that lead from the bathtub drain He
can hear the gurgling sound running through them It sound like they
ate something they cant digest He reaches up and touches the pipe
It

seems to be leaking a little or maybe it is condensation

Ed traces the noise to a larger sewage pipe
that runs down into the basement floor He watches the pipe but
slowly his attention is drawn to the shadow next to the pipe

As he stares intently into the darkness of the

shadow a figure begins to emerge in the distance The darkness begins
to change into a long hallway A small figure is walking towards Ed
and

his footsteps echo in the distance

Ed watches mesmerized

The basement fades into the blackness and now the hallway becomes
more clear

INT HOSPITAL
It is a very long hospital hallway and the figure walking toward Ed
is a doctor carrying a clipboard

DOCTOR

Mr Saxon

ED

Yes

DOCTOR

Theres nothing we can do for her now except to
alleviate any pain she may be feeling We have her on a morphine drip
and well keep increasing the dosage as she shows any signs of pain

ED

I see Can she understand me

DOCTOR

At this point probably not She has so much morphine

in her I doubt she can even recognize you But you never know
Actually in cases like this where the end is inevitable I recommend
that we increase the dosage on the morphine drip at an accelerated
rate Theres no point in making this last longer than it has to

ED

Whatever you think is best

The doctor nods then walks into the hospital

room where we see now Eds MOTHER is lying in a hospital bed hooked
up to a digital IV She is old but looks older - shes been through
chemotherapy and radiation and they have all taken their toll
She stares at Ed with confused and desperate eyes It is hard to tell
if she is looking at him or not

The doctor at the door has a few words with the NURSE who then
looks into the room

Ed sits next to his mother and takes her hand She stares at him

The nurse comes in and pushes a button on the
digital IV Ed watches the LED numbers on the digital IV go up The
nurse smiles an attempt at comfort then leaves the room

Mother reacts to the higher dosage of morphine

Her eyes get wider and more delirious She sits up a little and tenses
her muscles She lets go of Eds hand and starts moving her arm up and
down

She starts shouting something At first it is completely
unintelligible but slowly it becomes clearer

MOTHER

IT MEANS YOURE GOING TO HELL IT MEANS YOURE GOING TO HELL IT MEANS
YOURE GOING TO HELL

Ed stands up and backs away He backs out of the hospital room as his
mother continues to scream

Ed backs into the hallway which is now blackness

As he backs away another noise starts to echo around him A banging
A loud banging is coming from upstairs

Ed backs away and then runs upstairs

INT HALLWAY - DAY
As Ed opens the basement door he sees that it is bright daylight
again

INT LIVING ROOM

Ed opens the front door and before he can react a fist hits him hard
in the face

Ed falls to the ground next to a pile of letters that has been
dropped through the slot in the door

GEORGE SIMIAN walks in wearing a track suit

George 35 is a stronger man than Ed He is better looking too or
at least younger He has a genuine honesty about him like a big boy
It is this boyish quality that makes his anger seem uncontrollable

GEORGE

You son of a bitch Get up

Ed staggers to his feet He tries to get a swing

in at George but George grabs him by the collar hits him again then
throws him over the coffee table Ed hits the phone and the answering
machine on the way down

GEORGE

EVE

When Ed doesnt say anything George starts searching around the
house

GEORGE

(OS)

EVE
Ed can hear George searching around in the other rooms

He gets up and sits on the couch nursing his wounds

After a minute George comes back into the living room

GEORGE

What have you done

ED

Dont hit me again

GEORGE

You son of a bitch

George sits down on a chair across from Ed

GEORGE

You son of a bitch

ED

What did you think would happen Nothing

GEORGE

You did something

ED

I did what I always do I woke up went to my shitty
job came home and cooked dinner for my wife who was too busy
bouncing

up and down on your bedsprings to cook it herself Not exactly what I
had planned for my life The same boring shit as always Why dont you
leave

GEORGE

I love her Im sorry I know shes your wife

George is crying Ed despite himself is moved

ED

What Am I supposed to feel sorry for you now Well I

wont People think they can just carry on They dont think that
there

might be consequences to their actions You wont find sympathy here
Why dont you just leave

GEORGE

What did you do

ED

I didnt do anything She didnt come home after work

George gets up and starts to leave

ED

Dont come back here again

George stops when he hears this and turns

towards Ed with and angry look on his face He grabs Eds collar
picks

him up from the couch and slugs him hard across the head Ed lands on
the floor stunned and not moving
GEORGE

I swear If I find out you did something to her Ill kill you

Ed watches George leave and stays lying on the floor as Georges car
can be heard driving away outside

The telephone is lying on the floor knocked off

its cradle just out of Eds reach Ed stares at it for a few seconds
It is making that beeping noise that phones make when they are off the
hook too long

He slowly gets up and limps into the bathroom

INT BATHROOM

He looks in the mirror His eye is swelling up

already and his lip is bruised He washes his lip off and then takes
a

towel from the bathroom

INT KITCHEN

He fills the towel with ice and holds it to his head

INT LIVING ROOM

He picks up the phone as he walks into the

living room and places it on the coffee table He sits on the couch
and

stares at it for a second

Then he brings the phone over to his desk and finds Derms business
card He sits down at the desk and calls Derm

ED
Hello Detective

DERM

Mr Saxon

ED

Yes

DERM

Ive been trying to call you

ED

You found her

DERM

No I need to talk to you

ED

Detective George Simian was just over here He hit me

DERM

Are you OK

ED

I think so

DERM
Do you want me to call an ambulance

ED

I dont need an ambulance

DERM

Ill be right over

ED

OK

He hangs up the phone

He sits at the desk resting the ice on his forehead

Then he notices something under the sofa It grabs his attention He
gets up for a closer look

There are dust bunnies and dust under the edge

of the sofa like it hasnt been swept for a while Ed kneels down and
tries to peer under the sofa It is dark underneath and he cant see
anything

He reaches his fingers under and sweeps out a few dust bunnies

Then he reaches a little further under the sofa and sweeps out Eves
pinkie finger

He recoils at the sight of this The finger has

been neatly cut as if by a sharp blade Dust has clung to the clotted
blood around the stump but it is unquestionably a womans pinkie
finger

He stares at it for a second curiously disgusted

He goes to pick it up decides he doesnt want to touch it then uses
a tissue to pick it up

He hurries to the bathroom

INT BATHROOM

He drops the finger into the toilet with the tissue and flushes it

INT LIVING ROOM

He hurries to the edge of the couch with a sponge and cleans up the
small amount of blood and dust left there

INT KITCHEN

He squeezes the sponge out until it is clean then puts it aside

He lets out a huge sigh of relief

INT LIVING ROOM

Much of the ice has melted and the towel it was wrapped in is now
soaking wet

INT BATHROOM

He takes the towel into the bathroom and rings it out

Then he looks over at the toilet The finger is

still there floating like a cigarette butt The water is pink from
the

blood the tissue is gone but the finger floats there defiantly
He flushes the toilet again but this time stays to watch The water
goes down but the finger stays buoyant and wont go down

There is a knock on the front door

Ed takes a bunch of toilet paper from the roll

and tosses it over the finger He flushes again but the tank hasnt
filled up yet and if anything this makes it longer until it will
fill

up again

There is another impatient knock at the door

ED

One second

Ed sits there waiting listening to the toilet tank filling

The knocking outside is becoming more impatient

The tank finally fills Ed flushes and watches
This time the paper he threw in clogs the toilet and the bowl quickly
fills up with water

Ed reaches behind the toilet and turns off the water stopping it from
overflowing

He looks in the toilet and cant see the finger through the mess of
toilet paper

There is another knock on the door

Ed closes the toilet lid

INT HALLWAY
Ed shuts the bathroom door firmly takes a breath and hurries out to
meet Derm

INT LIVING ROOM

Ed answers the door Derm comes in with two assistants MAZUREK and
SNYDER Snyder is holding Eds morning paper

DERM

Damn You did take a couple of blows didnt you

ED

I was just putting some ice on it

DERM

Thats the best thing for it Try to keep the swelling
down Its going to look worse tomorrow You dont want to have a
doctor examine you

ED

Its not necessary

DERM

Mr Saxon Officer Mazurek and Officer Snyder Theyll be assisting
me

ED

Hi

MAZUREK
Hows it going

SNYDER

Here I brought this in

Snyder hands Ed the newspaper

ED

Thanks

DERM

You say it was George Simian who hit you

ED

Yes he did He came barreling in here and hit me

DERM

Do you have any idea why he would come here

ED

Because hes a fucking asshole

DERM

I should say that Im concerned that he would come
here Mr Simian has a history of violent behavior
domestic disputes

ED

Several times

in regards to
What kind of history

DERM

Nothing too serious No felonies But enough I think

to warrant some concern With your permission Id like to fill ina
complaint report for his assault on you and as soon as were finished
here Ill send these two over to arrest him assuming he can be
found

ED

You think he did something to Eve

DERM

We dont have any evidence that hes even seen your

wife she left her office and disappeared Well be arresting him
solely

for his assault on you

ED

But Eves car You said you found her car near his house

DERM

It does no one any good to jump to conclusions

ED

I guess I misunderstood

DERM

Were going to have to take some pictures of you for
the complaint report The pictures will be used as evidence against Mr
Simian if this matter does eventually go to trial

ED

Fine

Derm turns to Snyder who has heard this conversation and Snyder
begins to take pictures of Ed

DERM

Mr Saxon These investigations can be quite demanding

especially when experiencing the trauma of loss Do you understand
what

I am saying

ED

Yes

DERM

If you feel that you need someone to talk to at any
time there are people sometimes victims of similar situation
themselves who are will to listen and would like to help

He hands Ed a business card which reads Human Support Services and
has some address and phone information on it

DERM

Are you aware that your wife has been having an affair

ED

With George Simian
DERM

Yes

ED

The PE teacher I guess I should have known

DERM

Apparently your wife has been seeing him for some time Almost a
year in fact

ED

A year

DERM

Do you consider that you and your wife have a normal relationship

ED

I dont know Normal relationship We get on each

others nerves have sex a few times a year order pizza on Fridays
Weve been married for ten years It doesnt stay rosy forever Maybe
it isnt paradise but that doesnt mean that I dont love her

DERM

Are you having any other relationships

ED

No
DERM

Does your wife keep a diary

ED

No She isnt the type

DERM

Mr Saxon May I be frank

ED

Yes Please

DERM

Cases involving missing persons are not uncommon

many cases and that is not to say in every case
the results are unfortunate

ED

My God

DERM

In
but in many cases

Im not saying that you should give up hope but my
experience tells me that you should prepare yourself for the worst
Now having said that we will do everything in our power to find your

wife

ED

I understand
DERM

Now its best if we can gather as much information as
possible as quickly as possible Im sure you understand the urgency
here

ED

Of course

DERM

It will be necessary for us to search through some of your wifes
personal items

ED

Im sure I can find whatever it is that you want

DERM

Its really in your wifes best interests if you allow
us to do it We wont disturb anything or touch anything without your
permission

ED

Alright

DERM

How about we start in the bedroom

ED
The bedroom

DERM

Yes

ED

Right Ill show you

Ed stands up and leads them into the bedroom

INT HALLWAY

They pass by the bathroom The gurgling noises
from the plumbing echo around the hallway and while the police dont
seem to pay it any mind Ed can definitely hear it

INT BEDROOM

Ed looks around the bedroom quickly before they go in

ED

Here you go Its sort of a mess

DERM

Do you know where your wife keeps her credit card receipts

ED

Yes Sure This way

Ed leads Derm to Eves room leaving the two assistants in the
bedroom
INT EVES ROOM

Ed goes over to Eves writing desk and looks over the papers lying on
top

DERM

Nice room

ED

You like it

DERM

Yeah Very Magritte Its like a nursery

ED

I guess it is I always through it was more of a conservatory

DERM

With the piano

ED

Right She plays in here sometimes Its nice We
always wanted to fix up the whole house but this is the only room we
got to

DERM

Things always cost more than you think
ED

Yeah I dont know what happened Anyway we share a credit card but
she mostly uses her own

DERM

If someone has taken your wife theres a chance they
might have used one of her credit cards Or she might have used it
herself

Ed pulls at the locked drawer in the writing table

ED

I think she keeps the receipts in here but I dont have a key

Derm looks at the lock

DERM

Let me try

Ed gets out of the way and Derm sits in the
chair to examine the lock more closely He presses his thumbs against
the desk and breaks the wood around the lock forcing the drawer open

DERM

There we go

ED

I could have done it if I wanted to break it

DERM
Im sure shell understand

ED

She wont I promise

Ed sits back down and searches through the drawer He finds some
credit card receipts and sorts through them

MAZUREK

Detective Derm

Mazurek comes into the office carrying Sadies sweater which has
blood all over it

Snyder follows Mazurek in and looks over Mazureks shoulder

MAZUREK

It was under the bed sir

Derm takes the sweater and looks at the blood on it

DERM

Is this your wifes

ED

No

DERM
Theres blood on this sweater Mr Saxon

ED

Yes I know A student Detective this is going to

sound awkward I guess but a student of mine came to the house
yesterday after you were here She was nervous I suppose She hada
bloody nose

DERM

Why would she have been nervous

ED

I dont know but she seemed nervous

DERM

That is awkward isnt it

ED

I suppose it is I gave her one of my wifes sweaters to wear home
She must have left that one by accident

DERM

By accident Under the bed

ED

I dont know

DERM
What was her name

ED

Sadie Sadie Crumb

Derm finds a small printed name-tag reading
Sadie Crumb sewn into the collar Derm shows it to Mazurek and then
indicates for him to go back to the bedroom

Derm shows the label to Ed

DERM

Do you have this girls phone number Id like to talk to her

ED

I dont think so Maybe

Ed gets up and walks into the -

INT LIVING ROOM

- where his desk is He searches around and quickly finds a photocopy
of a hand-written list of phone numbers

DERM

I should call her

ED

Sure Here

He hands him the phone Derm dials the number
ED

I didnt tell her about my wife I didnt see any reason to

Derm reaches into his pocket and pulls out a
roll of Tums He takes a couple and chews them and it obviously puts a
bad taste in his mouth

DERM

Could I trouble you for a glass of water

ED

Sure

Ed walks into the -

INT HALLWAY

He passes by the bathroom and stops by the

bedroom door He looks into the bedroom where the officers are
searching through his stuff They find a copy of Hustler Magazine and
they chuckle about it before they notice Ed watching them

As he watches he can hear Derm talking to Sadie

DERM

(OS)

Hi May I speak to Sadie Crumb please This is
Detective Derm of the Seattle Police Department Can I ask you a few
questions

The officers turn and stare at Ed until he leaves
INT KITCHEN

Ed takes a glass from the cupboard He takes it

over to the sink and fills it with water The tap makes enough noise
so

that he cant hear anything else

INT HALLWAY

As Ed passes the bathroom door the gurgling
noises from the plumbing get louder He makes sure the door is firmly
shot and then brings the glass of water to Derm

INT LIVING ROOM

Derm hangs up the phone and drinks the water

DERM

Thank you

ED

Well

DERM

She sounded very nice You know I think she left her sweater under
your bed on purpose

ED

Why would she do that

DERM
So that shed have a reason to come back

ED

I see

Derm sees an open box of Skin-EE( cookies

DERM

Hey My wife loves those things I swear she eats them by the box
I think they taste like shit

ED

I know I hate them Sometimes I think she eats them just to spite
me

MAZUREK

Detective Derm

Derm looks at Ed then goes into the other room Ed follows

INT HALLWAY

DERM

Did you go to work today Mr Saxon

ED

No I guess I didnt

DERM
If youd like I can call the University for you and explain the
situation It might help Im sure they would understand

ED

I dont think its necessary

DERM

Well the offer stands if you change your mind later

ED

Its just that I dont want them to know anything about all this

least not yet

DERM

I understand

They walk into the -

INT BEDROOM

Mazurek is holding a small fabric-bound writing book

DERM

Whats that

MAZUREK

Looks like a diary sir

At
DERM

Lets have a look

Derm looks it over reads the last couple of entries quickly

DERM

Whered you find this

MAZUREK

Behind the bedside table

ED

I didnt know

DERM

We have to keep some things to ourselves or wed go crazy This is
your wifes handwriting

He shows him the diary

ED

Yes Can I look at that

DERM

Of course

Ed takes the diary and wanders into Eves room flipping through it as
he walks
INT EVES ROOM

Ed flips through the last pages of the diary He

reads for a minute Some distant noises are coming from the neighbors
house While we cant hear exactly what is being said it is clear
that

aman is saying something funny and a woman is laughing hysterically

Ed reads for a minute until astonished he puts it down and looks up
at Derm who is standing in the doorway watching him

ED

I guess you never really know anyone

DERM

You didnt know that youre wife is pregnant

ED

No

DERM

Im sorry I talked to her doctor yesterday I thought you knew

Mazurek comes up behind Derm and says something inaudibly in his ear

DERM

Is it alright if Mazurek uses the bathroom

ED

Excuse me
DERM

The bathroom May we use the bathroom We might be here for a while

ED

No The toilet is stuffed up Actually Do you mind leaving I
just would like to be alone

DERM

Mr Saxon Im sorry about the intrusions into your

privacy but you must understand my first priority is finding your
wife There is still a great deal to go over We might want to notify
the press

ED

The press

DERM

In cases like this when we dont have many substantial leads getting
a picture of your wife on TV can be invaluably helpful

ED

I dont know if Im comfortable with that

DERM

We still have options left but without a thorough search of your
wifes belongings those options are extremely limited

ED
I want to be helpful but I really dont see how if
you think she was kidnapped I dont see how it helps you to search
around our things

DERM

We dont know that she was kidnapped We cant draw
those kinds of conclusions She could have simply decided that she
needed some time alone We have to consider every possibility

ED

I just dont see how it helps

DERM

I dont want to argue with you Were trying to help you This is
our job

ED

I understand

DERM

It is in the best interest of your wife that you let us do that job
without impediment

ED

I dont want to get in the way I just would like some

time alone You can comes back tomorrow but please Im very tired
I

know it might seem irrational but I havent slept in a long time and
this is all extremely overwhelming Please I need to be alone

DERM
Certainly If I could just take those receipts

ED

Sure Here Take them all

The receipts are on the desk in front of him and he hands them to
Derm

Derm reaches out for the diary

ED

Id like to keep this

DERM

There are some things it may be better not to know especially if your
wife comes back

ED

I can give it to you tomorrow if you still want it

Ed leaves the diary on Eves writing table and walks the officers out

INT LIVING ROOM

DERM

Mr Saxon Is there something wrong with your answering machine

ED

Yes It broke when I fell on it
DERM

You havent been answering your phone

ED

It hasnt rung

Derm looks at the phone and sees the ringer is turned off

DERM

The ringer is off

ED

Oh I must have turned it off

DERM

What if your wife calls

DERM

Yes Of course I wasnt thinking

DERM

Could you please leave the phone on from now on

ED

Yes I thought I was OK Thank you
DERM

Ill be calling to let you know how things go with Mr Simian

ED

Yes Thank you

Derm and the officers leave

Ed lets out a sigh of relief He touches his forehead and it
obviously hurts

He goes back into the bathroom

INT BATHROOM

He opens the medicine cabinet and searches

through the plethora of over-the-counter medicine crowding the
shelves

He takes a bottle of Midol or some other feminine pain-killer He
takes a few of them and chases them down with a handful of tap water

Then he turns to the toilet lifts the lid and looks at the stuffed-up
mess

He rolls up his sleeve and sticks his hand in the bowl He searches
around for the finger

The phone rings He gives up searching and with some wet toilet
paper stuck to his arm hurries to answer the phone

INT LIVING ROOM

Ed picks up the phone

ED

No What does he want to see me about

ED

MRS MASTRIONI

MRS MASTRIONI

ED

Fuck you

Ed slams the phone down

INT BATHROOM

Ed takes the bottle of Midol from the medicine cabinet and takes a few
more

Then he notices a trail of pink water leading from the toilet along
the bathroom floor and into the hallway

He follows the trail

INT HALLWAY

The trail leads up to the pinkie finger Ed

watches while the finger moves inchworm-like across the floor
toward

Eves room leaving a wet trail behind it

Ed watches for a second while he decides what to do

He quickly grabs the finger and takes it to the

kitchen sink He drops it in the sink pushes it down the drain and
flicks the garbage disposal on He turns the water on and leaves it
running until it sounds like there is nothing left of the finger
When he turns it off he sticks his hand in searching for any
remnants of the finger It appears to have gone down

He takes the sponge and wets it

INT HALLWAY

He wipes up the trail of the finger following it back into the
bathroom

INT BATHROOM

He looks at the toilet which is still stuffed up

INT BASEMENT

Ed searches around the basement for a plunger The basement is full
of strange sounds all ruminating from the exposed pipes

He finds a plunger among some other tools and

starts back upstairs but on his way upstairs he finds that there is
a

puddle of water on the floor He traces the source of the puddle to
the

pipe that was only moist before It is now dripping slowly and a large
pool of dirty water is collecting in the shallow recess of the cement
floor

Ed stares into the murky black pool

There is a knock on the door upstairs and Ed turns to answer it

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Ed answers the door and sees that it is now dark outside

GEOFFREY COSTAS stands outside Geoffrey 54 is
a wise patient man He is formal and calm in his manner but these
qualities belie a warm emotional vulnerability Physically he is not
small or weak One gets the impression that he wasnt always so kind

GEOFFREY

Mr Saxon

ED

Yes

GEOFFREY

Hello My name is Geoffrey Costas Im from Human Support Services

ED

Im not interested

GEOFFREY

Detective Derm asked me to stop by

He hands him a business card Ed takes the card and looks it over

GEOFFREY

Youve been hit

ED

Im fine I dont need a doctor

He tries to hand the card back
GEOFFREY

Oh Im not a physician Im a psychiatrist But Im not here on
business This is my time off

ED

This is a personal visit I dont understand

GEOFFREY

Human Services is a volunteer organization We offer assistance to
victims of traumatic crimes

ED

What kind of assistance

GEOFFREY

Advice support a shoulder to cry on

ED

Why would I want to cry on your shoulder

GEOFFREY

Maybe you just want someone to talk to It can be a lonely world when
those you love are taken from you

ED

No I dont think so
GEOFFREY

Well you have my card If you feel like talking at another time

please feel free to call

ED

Actually there is something you can help me with

trouble sleeping

GEOFFREY

Thats understandable under the circumstances

ED

Is there something you can give me

GEOFFREY

You mean a prescription

ED

Youre a doctor arent you

GEOFFREY

Yes

ED

I cant seem to find anything strong enough

GEOFFREY

Ive been having
Youre anxious

ED

Yes I cant sleep It makes me anxious Or maybe I cant sleep
because Im anxious I dont know

GEOFFREY

How long has this been going on

ED

A long time

GEOFFREY

Weeks

ED

Oh yes

GEOFFREY

You must have slept some

ED

Maybe I do But I dont seem to get the benefits I

never feel rested There just doesnt seem to be the time to relax
anymore Im always two steps behind I have to stop the thinking The
longer I stay awake the more my thoughts become frantic irrational
If I dont get some sleep soon nothing is going to make any sense

GEOFFREY
I see May I come in

ED

Yes Come in

Geoffrey comes in and places his briefcase on the table inside

GEOFFREY

There are times when the pressures of everyday life

become overwhelming As a doctor I notice more and more of my
patients

experiencing similar symptoms Im afraid its a sign of the times as
much as anything else

ED

Can you help me

GEOFFREY

Like I said Im not here on a professional basis Your

insomnia is merely a symptom of a greater unwholesomeness A lasting
treatment may be extremely hard to come by Theres very little we can
hope to accomplish with pharmaceuticals alone However under the
circumstances I can give you something to help you sleep Do you have
health insurance

ED

Yes through work

Geoffrey takes a prescription pad from his briefcase and scribbles out
a prescription

GEOFFREY
The prescription Im going to write for you is

expensive so I recommend you save the receipt for your insurance
company Im sure theyll cover it These pills are quite new Ive
been prescribing them to my patients who travel a great deal for
their

jet lag They will help stabilize your internal clock by chemically
suppressing certain amino acids in your brain

ED

Will it help me sleep

GEOFFREY

Oh yes Now take two at night and dont take more than six ina
day OK

ED

Yes Thank you

Geoffrey shuts his briefcase and starts to leave

GEOFFREY

Im glad I could help How about I check in on you tomorrow
afternoon

ED

Tomorrow

GEOFFREY

To see how youre doing
ED

I dont know

GEOFFREY

For what its worth I understand your position better

than you think Dont shut it all out Sometimes that fragile
connection to the rest of the world is all we have I sincerely hope
things turn out for you Tomorrow then

ED

Tomorrow

Ed shuts the door behind Geoffrey

INT BATHROOM

Ed works the plunger in the toilet The water is

still pink from the finger but also might be pink from the pink
toilet

paper that is now broken up and mixed in with the water

He plunges the toilet a few more times and then

stops to see if it is working The water slowly goes down He reaches
behind the toilet and turns the water back on He flushes it and it
seems to be working again albeit weakly

He sits on the edge of the bathtub and takes a
breath The water in the tub hasnt gone down so he takes the plunger
and starts to work it over the drain

After a minute he sees that it isnt working
He reaches into the drain and pulls out a huge clump of scum-filled
hair It is repulsive to Ed He throws it into the toilet

The water in the bathtub still hasnt gone down

INT KITCHEN
He searches under the sink through an exhaustive
supply of cleaning supplies He eventually pulls out a king-size
container of Drano

INT BATHROOM

He reads the back of the container quickly then pours the whole thing
down the drain

He watches it for a second waiting for it to go down

Slowly then softly the piano can be heard playing in the other room

Ed listens to it before following it down the hallway

INT HALLWAY

The lamp on Eves writing desk is on and it lights up the end of the
hallway The music still seems to be coming from her room

INT EVES ROOM

Ed comes in and looks around the room There is no one playing the
piano but the music continues over the rest of the scene

Eds attention turns to the diary which is
still sitting on the desk where he left it Ed sits in the chair and
starts paging through Eves diary The piano continues playing

We hear Eves voice as it must have been when she was writing

EVE

(V0)

More than three weeks late Damn Im so stupid I
havent told George because Im sure he would use this as an excuse to
pressure me to leave Ed And how can I tell Ed Theres no way he
could

be the father We havent had sex in months He would know it isnt
is

Ed flips back a few pages

As he does the camera starts to travel around
the room passing the piano and then a few pictures from Eves past
then some souvenirs on a shelf

EVE

(V0)

Saw a movie last night with George It was awful just

the kind of movie Ed hates I wanted to tell him about it but I
couldnt I told him I was at Susies George loved it of course I
think he likes every movie Still it was nice to go out on a date
like

that It was fun

INT HALLWAY

Now the camera has turned to the empty hallway It slowly moves
toward the bathroom

EVE

(V0)

Ed came home in a shitty mood and started picking a

fight with me about a coffee cup I broke last week It was the last
thing I needed today especially Sometimes I fucking hate him He can
be such a shit

INT KITCHEN

The camera pans over the glass that has Eves lipstick on it
EVE

(V0)

I cant believe what a jock George is I knew he worked

out but he really takes car of himself After we had sex I was
embarrassed to let him see me naked How could I have gotten so fat
Im going back to the gym tomorrow Ive really let myself go to pot
Maybe Ill get him a softball bat for his birthday next week

INT BATHROOM

The camera comes into the bathroom and passes over all of Eves things
sitting on the back of the toilet

EVE

(V0)

Ed doesnt sleep anymore Hes beginning to scare me

He takes all these pills to help him sleep but they only make it
worse And he hates me I can see it in his eyes He blames me for
everything that went wrong in his life Maybe hes right Maybe it is
my fault I feel so guilty about George that I cant argue with him
anymore I cant keep this up much longer Fuck it Im going to tell
him about George tomorrow He knows anyway He must know Hes been
acting so weird Poor Ed He used to have so much ambition And hes
so

talented I just wish things had turned out better

The camera turns toward the bathtub and

focuses slowly in on the drain A few bubbles pop out from under the
water and the water starts to drain out As the camera dollies in on
the drain the last of the murky water disappears

Ed now standing in the bathroom strikes a
match and holds it up to the diary until the corner finally catches on
fire He fans out the pages so that it will catch more

When he cant hold it anymore he drops it
into the bathtub and watches it burn He watches it until it has burnt
itself out burning into a pile of thick black ashes

INT HALLWAY

Ed looks up at the smoke alarm He tries to pull it down but it is
out of his reach

Ed grabs a chair from the living room and stands
on it so that he can reach the alarm He pulls the cover off the alarm
and then the battery out and the alarm is finally silenced

Then he hears voices coming from outside the front door

He approaches the front door cautiously then

puts his ear up to the door and listens The voices are muted and
whispered but Ed can still hear what is being said although it is
hard to tell who is talking

HARVEY

(OS)

No I wont

SADIE

(OS)

HARVEY

(OS)

SADIE

Ed opens the door quickly

EXT PORCH - NIGHT

Sadie and Harvey freeze like caught children

Sadie slams the door on him

INT LIVING ROOM

Sadie stands staring at the floor

SADIE

I cant believe that

He followed you

SADIE

ED

Somebody hit me

SADIE

ED

SADIE

ED

ED

But nothing happened

SADIE

Thats what I told them

ED

They found your sweater It has blood all over it

SADIE

Oh yeah Damn I dont know why I do things like that

ED

SADIE

ED

Ed finds his wallet and hands her the card

SADIE

Ill be back in a minute

ED
Thank you

Sadie skips out the door and Ed shuts it behind her

INT BATHROOM

Ed turns on the shower washing the ashes down the drain

After hes watched them go down he takes a
sponge and cleans off the burnt mark in the tub as best he can He
turns the shower on rinsing it out

He turns the shower off and hears the phone is ringing

INT LIVING ROOM

Ed picks up the phone

DERM

Mr Saxon Detective Derm

ED

Yes hi

DERM

I wanted to let you know that weve taken Mr Simian into custody

ED

I understand
DERM

We found him at his place of work

ED

At the school

DERM

Yes We arrested him there Hell come up for
arraignment tomorrow morning and then as far as I can tell hell
probably be released on his own recognizance

ED

I see

DERM

Its just standard procedure but I thought Id keep you informed

ED

Yes Thank you Did he say anything about Eve

DERM

Try to rest Mr Saxon We have a lot of ground to cover tomorrow

ED

I will Thank you

DERM
Good night

Ed hangs up the phone

Then he hears some sounds coming from Eves room

INT EVES ROOM

Ed takes a few steps into Eves room He traces the noises to the
window and looks out at the neighbors house

The light is on in the neighbors window and

there are some vague shadows moving around on the closed curtain As
the noises get louder it soon becomes clear that the neighbors are
having sex

Ed peers out at the light in the window

listening to the womans increasing moans The woman seems to be in
some sort of painful orgasmic delight In other words it mostly
sounds like she is having a good time but there should be a growing
suspicion that not all is right

WOMAN

(OS)

Oh Oh Oh Oh OH OH NO NO NO

Ed backs slowly away from the window He hears someone knocking on
the front door

INT LIVING ROOM

Ed opens the door and Sadie comes in holding a colorful paper bag

ED
Thank you

Ed takes the bag from Sadie and goes into the kitchen

INT KITCHEN

Sadie follows him in

Ed opens the pills quickly and swallows three of them with a glass of
water

SADIE

Those pills cost a lot They must be strong

ED

Theyre sleeping pills Ive been having trouble sleeping

SADIE

You must have anxiety I can never get to sleep when Im anxious

ED

I am anxious Yes

Sadie takes some other stuff out of the bag One
of the items is an individually wrapped Skin-EE( fat-free cookie
chocolate chocolate chip

SADIE

I got you some peroxide and stuff And a cookie I havent eaten
today
ED

You put it all on my credit card right

SADIE

Actually I paid for it They wouldnt take your card

ED

Why not

SADIE

They said you hadnt paid your bill on the phone They called the
credit card people when it didnt go through

ED

Damn Well Ill pay you back

SADIE

Its OK I charged it to my Dad I dont even pay the bill

ED

No those pills are expensive And my insurance will cover it anyway

SADIE

Pay me back later then Really its OK

ED
Are you sure

SADIE

Its fine I swear

Sadie looks at the cuts on his face

SADIE

Your face must hurt

ED

No I dont seem to feel anything

SADIE

Its nasty

Sadie takes a closer look

SADIE

Here Sit down

She sits Ed down at the kitchen table under a

light and sits across from him then takes the peroxide and some
cotton swabs she bought at the pharmacy and starts to dress his
wounds

ED

Ive never been hit before

SADIE
Me neither

ED

Its not so bad really Its humbling but I like the

effect it seems to have on people It seems to make them more
compassionate Theres a competitive market for suffering in the
world

Its difficult to stand out from the handicapped and the homeless and
the politically oppressed Sometimes a little advertising helps remind
people that youre a human being

SADIE

It does make you look sort of cute in a pathetic kind of way

ED

Sadie

SADIE

Are you really married

ED

What You think I just made it up

SADIE

I dont know Some people just say theyre married you know because
maybe they think its more respectable or something

ED

Im not one of those people
SADIE

I didnt mean to imply anything Its just that you act sort of
weird

ED
I act weird
SADIE

Not weird really Worried I guess Secretive Like youre worried
I might find out something about you

ED

You dont want to get involved with my problems
SADIE

Maybe I do

ED

Believe me you dont

SADIE

I didnt mean to pry Well maybe I did Ill just put a band-aid on
it

ED

Would you like a drink Im going to have one
1ttlHe finds a bottle of wine
SADIE

Youre not supposed to mix wine with sleeping pills It increases the
amount of medicine thats absorbed into the bloodstream
1ttlEd searches for a corkscrew and starts to open the bottle

ED

I need all the help I can get

SADIE

Its dangerous

ED

Its just wine Ill only have a glass

1ttlHe offers her some and she nods He pours her a glass Sadie takes
her glass into the living room Ed downs his glass of wine and refills
it quickly before following her

INT LIVING ROOM
1ttlShe sits down at his desk

SADIE

Are you working on anything new

ED

No I dont write anymore

SADIE

Why not
ED

I just dont have the time I have to work all day Time just slips
by

SADIE

I know what you mean Theres not enough time in the day

ED

Not as much as there used to be

SADIE

There used to be more

ED

Yes Before I had to work there was plenty of time

SADIE

But you had all that stuff published

ED

Sure but it didnt pay very much I had a lot of debts

from school that needed to be paid off And then credit cards And
then I got married bought a house Life comes with all these
expenses

And poetry just doesnt pay I thought working at the University would
at least give me summers off

SADIE
Doesnt it

ED

Not really No

1ittlThere is a knock on the door The idea that someone else might
see them together makes it awkward for both of them

1ttlEd freezes for what seems like a long time long enough for
whoever it is to knock again

ED

I better see who that is

SADIE

Yeah
1ttlEd goes over to the door and opens it cautiously It is Eves
friend SUSIE

SUSIE

Hi its me

ED

Oh hi Susie
1ttlShe is about to walk in when Ed blocks her way She can see
Sadie sitting at Eds desk holding a glass of wine

ED

Eves not here

SUSIE

Oh She came back though didnt she
ED

No she didnt

SUSIE

Oh no Can I come in

EXT PORCH - NIGHT

1ttlEd rather than let her in pushes her outside and shuts the door

behind her

ED

No Im busy right now I called the police

SUSIE

What did they say

ED

Theyre working on it You can call them if you want
1ttlEd finds Derms card in his pocket and hands it to her

SUSIE

Arent you worried

ED

Of course Im worried Im just working right now This

girl is one of my students She wanted some help on an assignment

doesnt know anything about Eve being missing

SUSIE

ED

SUSIE

ED

1ttlSusie starts crying
inside

SUSIE

1ttlEd stops

SUSIE

ED

Ed stares at her helplessly then goes back

Its late I just took some sleeping pills I havent slept much

since this all started

SUSIE

Tomorrow

ED

Why dont you come back tomorrow
Good night Susie

Ed walks back in leaving Susie standing on the porch

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Ed waits by the door until he hears her footsteps walking away
outside

Sadie stands up looking nervous

SADIE
2t2Is that your wife

ED
2t2No It was a friend of hers

SADIE
2t2I should go

ED
2t2No Why

SADIE
2t2You must be tired Those pills must be working

ED
2t2I dont think theyre working at all

2t2Yeah but please dont go Please Time has a way of slowing

SADIE
2t2Really For me too

ED
2t2So youll stay

SADIE
2t21If you want me to

Ed comes over to her and kisses her

SADIE
2t2Can I ask you something

ED
2t2What

SADIE
2t2Do you think my writing is good

ED
2t2Youve done some good work

SADIE
2t2Yeah C minus good

ED
2t2I told you I was in a bad mood when I graded that

SADIE
2t2I guess so

She is unresponsive at first

SADIE

(to herself)
2t2What am I doing
They kiss for a minute then Ed slips his hand under the back of
Sadies sweater

She kisses him again

INT BEDROOM

Sadie turns the lights off and we can only see by the light coming in
from the hallway

Ed lies on the bed and Sadie lies next to him
under the covers Ed slips his hand under the back of her sweater and
fiddles with her bra while they kiss

The gurgling sound starts up again and while

Sadie doesnt notice or doesnt hear it it becomes increasingly
distracting to Ed He looks to the bathroom where the noise is coming
from

INT BATHROOM

The camera focuses in on the drain The water in the bathtub starts
rising again

INT BEDROOM

Sadie breaks away from him sits up and takes off her sweater Ed
takes off his shirt

Eds kisses move around the side of her neck As
he reaches her ear he looks up and notices Eves clothes sitting on
the chair

INT BATHROOM

The water is rising slowly but we can see solid

stuff (the ashes from the diary are clearly part of the muck) seeping
out of the drain with the water It is a cloudy dark disgusting
water

which probably stinks too
INT BEDROOM

Ed is trying to concentrate on Sadie but he notices the closet door
is open and there are some dresses blowing around inside

And the noise from the bathroom is getting louder

He turns Sadie onto her back turning himself

away from the closet His kisses run down her chest until he gets to
her jeans He unbuttons her jeans and starts to pull them off kissing
as he goes

Ed has taken her pants off but his passion and
enthusiasm has faded and he stops and stares off into space towards
the bathroom He is spooked

SADIE
2t2Whats wrong

He looks down and sees Sadie staring at him

ED
2t2I dont know Maybe its those pills I dont know

SADIE
2t2Just relax Lie back

Sadie gently pushes him back and starts to go down on him

Ed get more uptight

ED
2t2No Please Just stop

She keeps trying until Ed is forced to push her away

ED
2t2Its just not working OK

SADIE
2t2Alright Im sorry

Sadie turns away Shes upset

SADIE
2t2Maybe I should go

ED
2t2No Please dont Its my fault Please Dont go

SADIE
2t2Damn Im so stupid

ED
2t2No its me Please

SADIE
2t2This was a mistake

Sadie gets up and puts on her shirt She grabs the rest of her
clothes and goes into the living room

Ed stares after her listening to her finish dressing herself and then
leave

The clock next to the bed is ticking loudly and the sound of the
ticking continues of the next few scenes as indicated

INT KITCHEN

Ed pours a few more pills into his hand swallowing them with some
wine from the bottle

INT BATHROOM
Ed looks at the bathtub which is full of the

murky water He picks up the plunger which is still by the toilet
and

starts working it on the drain

More stuff is coming up making the water
darker but as he relaxes the plunger the water doesnt go down If
anything the gurgling sound is louder

He works the plunger some more more vigorously
and then again relaxes it and watches the drain hopefully The
gurgling noise seems closer and the water still does not go down

Then he hears something hit the front door

INT LIVING ROOM

Ed opens the front door and picks up the
newspaper which has just been thrown He puts it with the other
newspapers which have piled up in their plastic wraps on his desk

INT BATHROOM

He comes back into the bathroom and looks at the bathtub

He puts the plunger over the drain and works it

much harder and this time after a few seconds there is a loud knock
in the pipes as if he hit something He takes the plunger away and
watches the drain

Suddenly a large air bubble bursts out of the drain He watches but
the water shows no sign of draining

Then slowly blood starts to leak into the tub from the drain

Ed is naturally terrified by this He watches until it is clear that
it is blood and not just more gook

He puts plunger back on the drain and pumps it a
few more frantic times More blood seeps out of the drain He seems to
be making the problem worse

He shuts the shower curtain and backs out of the bathroom

INT KITCHEN

He spills the pills on the kitchen counter and
counts them quickly There are about ten left He pours them into his
mouth and swallows the rest of the wine

Then the ticking stops Ed looks at a clock on the wall The second
hand has stopped

He hears voices in the other room

INT EVES ROOM

He looks out of the window in Eves room He

sees that the light in the neighbors window is on The couple next
door are having another argument but this one is much more intense
than the last

WOMAN

(OS)

2t2Why do you care You dont care You know nothing about me I hate
you Stay away from me Ill scream I am not screaming now You think
youre the only one Yes I do I LOVE YOU You never do that You do
not You never do anything You think that nothings wrong You think
we live in paradise This is what I think of this fucking house

There is the sound of things breaking

WOMAN

(OS)

ITS NOT MY FAULT ITS NOT MY FAULT THEN DONT I AM
NOT I LOVE YOU FUCK YOU I CANT BELIEVE YOU SAID THAT STAY AWAY
FROM ME YOU RUINED MY LIFE STAY AWAY FROM ME STOP IT SHUT UP STAY
AWAY FROM ME NO STOP IT YOU SON OF A BITCH HELP HELP

This ends with a loud terrifying shriek It seems to echo around the
room as Ed watches Then the voices stop

Ed watches the window and sees a featureless man
stick his head through the curtains to see if anybody is listening
Then he closes the window and curtains

The phone rings in the other room

INT KITCHEN

He hurries to answer the phone

While he is on the phone a new sound is coming from the bathroom It
is like the gurgling sound but also subtly different

ED

Hello

DERM

Mr Saxon

ED

Yes

DERM

Its Detective Derm Im sorry to call you so late but I thought you
would want to hear this

ED
Yes

DERM

Im afraid I have some bad news

ED

What is it

DERM

Its your wife Weve found her

ED

You found her

DERM

We found her body

ED

Her

DERM

Yes sir In the woods near George Simians house where we found
her car Im afraid shes dead

Ed drops the phone He walks trance-like into the hallway

He follows the noise into the -
INT BATHROOM

The noise coming from the bathroom now sounds more human like a baby
gurgling

As Ed walks into the bathroom he can see that

there is something in the bathtub The shower curtain is closed but
behind it there is some sort of body moving Ed pulls the curtain
back He reveals a baby just born lying in the tub Most of the
murky

water has drained and left a dirty ring around the tub

The BABY is a newborn except that its eyes are
maybe larger than they would be The Baby is also SIX FEET TALL Its
immense frame fills the bathtub It is naked (its a boy)

Ed watches with amazement The baby looks
incredibly real except for its size The stare at each other for a
minute The baby looks a lot like George Simian It has his eyes

Other than this it behaves like a baby It is

lying on its back gurgling peacefully with his feet in the air and
his

left hand gripping the shower curtain

The baby reaches out for Ed lovingly

Ed backs away

Seeing this the baby starts crying

Ed panicking approaches the baby It is still

crying Ed reaches out to touch it He touches its arm and the babys
crying starts to subside The baby moves with typical quick chaotic
movements that because of the babys size are almost threatening

Ed puts his hand in the babys hand The baby
grips it as babys do but this babys hand is about the size of Eds
The baby stops crying and returns to its curious gurgling
Ed tries to pull his hand back but the baby

wont let go The baby it seems is incredibly strong Ed pulls
harder He still cant get the baby to let go Ed tries to pry the
babys fingers off and this time manages to get his hand out of the
babys grip

But as soon as he does the baby starts crying again

He backs out into the hallway

INT HALLWAY

Ed is in a panic The babys cries echo around him as he backs away
from the bathroom

INT KITCHEN

Ed finds himself in the kitchen He looks at his

hands which are covered with bloody muck from the tub He washes them
off in the sink He looks over at the kitchen knife which has been
drying in the dish rack

INT HALLWAY

Ed walks slowly purposefully to the bathroom The crying baby gets
louder as he approaches

INT BATHROOM

He comes into the bathroom but in the tub

instead of the baby there is a grown mans body It is Ed staring up
at himself from under the water We only see a very tight shot of
BATHTUB EDs head and part of his neck His head is under water and he
looks up unable to move

We then see the reverse shot of this and it is

also of Ed so that Ed is in effect looking up at himself through
the

cloudy water
The baby cries continue although the baby is no longer in the scene

From Bathtub Eds point of view we see the other Ed takes the kitchen
knife and lean forward and to the right off-camera

Bathtub Ed who can move his eyes tries to look
to his arm where the other Ed is cutting Soon blood starts to mix
with the water diffusing over Bathtub Eds face

The blood also diffuses over Bathtub Eds

POV as he looks up at the other Ed cutting him When the other Ed
is finished cutting Bathtub Ed sees him put the knife aside and then
reach down off-camera After a short struggle the other Ed pulls up
Bathtub Eds severed arm and slips it into a garbage bag he has
already

prepared

The blood from Bathtub Eds cut fills the water with dark blood
turning the film red

The red dissolves into a pool of blood that is in the hallway

INT HALLWAY

Ed with a bucket and sponge is cleaning pockets of blood from the
floor and walls He is crying while he does this

He squeezes the sponge for the last time then
inspects the hallway as closely as he can searching for any spots he
might have missed

Then he picks up the bucket and takes it into the bathroom

INT BATHROOM

He dumps the water from the bucket into the
bathtub The water is pink and dirty He sits down on the edge of the
bathtub and watches the water go down the drain
He stares at the drain in a trance until he hears a knock on the front
door He turns to listen to it in the other room

INT HALLWAY - DAY

As he opens the bathroom door he sees that the sun is shining in from
the living room

INT LIVING ROOM

Geoffrey stands patiently outside as Ed opens
the door He carries his briefcase and looks dressed for work His
appearance is a stark contrast to the half-dressed blood-shot Ed

GEOFFREY

Hi I wanted to see how you were getting along

ED

Getting along

GEOFFREY

I have to say you dont look well

ED

Im not well

GEOFFREY

Have you slept

ED
I dont know Maybe Its difficult to tell

but Id hardly call it sleep

GEOFFREY

Did you take the pills

ED

The pills are fucking useless

GEOFFREY

But you took them

ED

Yes

GEOFFREY

I see May I take your blood pressure

ED

OK fine

Geoffrey comes in and places his briefcase on

I have these lapses

the table He takes a stethoscope and the rest of his blood pressure

kit and starts to take Eds blood pressure

ED

I feel like a lab rat Like one of those lab rats they drug up and

study You know what I mean
GEOFFREY

You feel like a rat

ED

They put them in a maze and they give them shocks and

drugs and they see what they do They try to prod them in the
direction

they want them to go

GEOFFREY

Try to relax

ED

I feel like a rat who took all the turns took all the

drugs went down the right path and then when I got to the end they
shocked me anyway right up the sphincter like it was all just a big
joke I guess they thought Id be too drugged up to notice

GEOFFREY

Its been a few days hasnt it since your wife disappeared

ED
Days Yes I guess
GEOFFREY

Has there been any word from the police

ED

Havent you talked to them
GEOFFREY

No But if youd like me to I will on your behalf They know me
and Ive been through this before

ED

With others

GEOFFREY

With others and myself My wife was taken from me about three years
ago

ED

What happened

GEOFFREY

It was a similar situation to yours The police found
her car in the parking lot of a mall They found her body about a week
later in some woods nearby

ED

She was murdered

GEOFFREY

Yes

ED

Did they ever catch the man who did it
GEOFFREY

No

ED

Why would somebody do that

GEOFFREY

Sometimes a man when faced with his own problems or inadequacies
takes it out on someone weaker than themselves

ED

Im sorry

GEOFFREY

Do you feel responsible at all for your wifes disappearance

ED

Why

GEOFFREY

People often blame themselves for events that they have

no control over especially when the events seem so random and cruel
Action leading up to tragedy tend to become more significant Details
weigh on the conscience

ED

I do seem to be having problems with my conscience
GEOFFREY

I see

ED

Do you think thats why I cant sleep

GEOFFREY

Could be

ED

Is there anything you can give me

GEOFFREY

A prescription For your conscience Of course not

ED

Then whats the point

GEOFFREY

There are other ways I can be of help

ED

A shoulder to cry on

GEOFFREY
Would you like me to call the police There might be some news

ED

The police called last night late last night They found Eves body

GEOFFREY
Oh no
ED

They found her buried in the woods near where they found her car

GEOFFREY

Im sorry I didnt know

Geoffreys watch alarm goes off He looks at the

time and then habitually takes a shiny silver pillbox from his
pocket

He takes two pills out

GEOFFREY

Excuse me

ED

I never knew I could feel so alone

Geoffrey takes a thermos from his briefcase pours some hot tea into
the lid and swallows the pills with a mouthful of tea

GEOFFREY
He hasnt called since last night

ED

No

GEOFFREY

Its been a while Why dont you let me call him Maybe theres some
news

When Ed doesnt object Geoffrey takes his address book from his
briefcase along with a cellular phone and dials the number

GEOFFREY

Detective Derm please Hi Charlie its Geoffrey Im

over at Ed Saxons house Yeah He was hoping to get some information
on his wife Uh-huh Well he said you called him last night and told
him that you had found her body Uh-huh I see In the woods near
where you found her car I dont know Yes Well I did give him
something to help him sleep Right Yes

Then Geoffrey turns away from Ed and says a few words quietly so that
Ed cant hear Then

GEOFFREY

Yes Yes Ill tell him Yes OK Bye

Geoffrey hangs up and turns back to Ed

ED

What

GEOFFREY
He says he never called you last night

ED

What

GEOFFREY

He told me to tell you to wait here for him that hes coming over

ED

I dont understand

GEOFFREY

It is possible that you did fall asleep that you
dreamed the phone call I have to say that I was surprised when you
said you hadnt slept Those pills are very effective

ED

The pills Yes Maybe

GEOFFREY

Still this is better isnt it I mean now theres still a chance
Your wife could still beTheres still hope

George hangs up

INT BATHROOM

The bathroom is completely clean There is no

sign of any of the activity from before Ed finds the bottle of
prescription sleeping pills It is empty He takes a couple of Midol
and swallows them dry

INT LIVING ROOM
Ed sits down at his desk He looks over the papers on his desk
Sadies is on top He looks it over

The phone rings and he picks it up

ED

ED

Yes

SADIE

ED

Yes

SADIE

I wish things had turned out better

She hangs up Ed stays on the phone listening until the dial tone
clicks back in

Then Ed hears a car pull up outside He follows some quiet footsteps
as they walk up to the front door

He sees the door knob turn quietly in the door The door is locked
Ed approaches the door slowly but suddenly there is a crash against
it Someone is trying to knock the door down

The door is strong and doesnt open but the wall around it shakes

After a few seconds there is another crash

against the door This time the wall shakes so much that Eves
picture

which hangs by the door almost falls off its nail

Ed looks out of the window The window is

positioned facing the street but not the porch so he cannot see who
it is but he can see a car parked out front with the door still
open

Inside the car there is a softball glove lying on the passenger seat
along with something that George Simian was wearing when we last saw
him

George crashes against the door again This
time Eves picture falls off the wall It hits the ground and smashes
spreading broken glass around her picture

The door is starting to loosen around the lock and jamb

INT HALLWAY

Ed backs into the hallway As he passes the bathroom he can hear the
gurgling sounds from the plumbing starting up again

INT KITCHEN

Ed backs into the kitchen He searches around

quickly finding the kitchen knife He grabs it out of the dish rack
and

starts walking toward the front door

INT HALLWAY

Theres another bang on the door Ed passes slowly through the
hallway watching the door holding the knife in front of him
The gurgling sounds in the bathroom are deep and resonant echoing out
of the drain around the bathroom and into the hallway

There is another hard crash against the door
which breaks the jamb The door is only being held on by the splinters
around the lock and George starts kicking the door with his foot

Ed backs into the basement door He opens it and goes into the-

INT BASEMENT

He hurries down the stairs into the darkness of

the basement The pipes surround Ed with hysterical thick watery
sounds There are metallic creaks and strains which reverberate around
the walls of the basement as the pipes seem to expand and contract

A couple of inches of dark dirty water have collected on the floor
and Eds feet get wet as he steps off the last stair

Ed finds a place to hide in the shadows behind
some boxes He stares up as he hears the door breaking open upstairs
and someone walking into the living room

With his eyes he follows the footsteps as they search the apartment

Ed has hidden under a large pipe which is

dripping drops of dirty water onto his face In the darkness of the
basement the color of the water is unclear but as he wipes some onto
his fingers he can see it is murky and dark

The basement door opens slowly and from the
light upstairs Ed can see the silhouette of George Simian standing
with a softball bat

Ed grips onto his knife and watches as George

comes down the stairs step by step The water keeps dripping on the
top of Eds head running down the side of his face but he holds
still

Ed watches George come down the stairs
George reaches the bottom and steps into the shallow water He peers
cautiously into the shadows He starts walking toward Ed

Ed withdraws as much as he can into his corner until he is in complete
darkness

He watches George approaching him and he slowly raises his knife

George raises his softball bat He takes a few
more steps up to Ed but then steps blindly past him and into a deep
dark shadow

Ed watches him disappear into the shadow and
then makes his move He rushes into the shadow with his knife raised
and both he and George are engulfed in darkness

After a few seconds Ed emerges from the

shadow He drops the knife into the water at his feet As he does
blood runs out of the shadow mixing with the water in the basement
floor

Ed walks slowly upstairs The noises around him in the basement are
now at their loudest

INT BATHROOM

Ed takes a long look at himself in the mirror

He is wet with blood and dirt He opens the medicine cabinet and finds
the sleeping pills he was using before He opens the bottle and
empties

it into his hand There are only about five pills left

He takes the two toothbrushes from a toothpaste-crusty glass and fills
it with water He takes the pills

Unsatisfied he searches through the rest of the

medicine cabinet The selection though not particularly toxic is a
good representation of standard over-the-counter pills and tonics He
finds the Midol and takes the last few from the bottle There is a
bottle of cold medicine which he finishes off He drinks down a nearly
full bottle of pink diarrhea medicine He finds a bottle of
multi-vitamins and takes a handful of those As he finishes each one
he drops the empties onto the floor of the bathroom

When he stops he notices blood seeping out of
the bathtub drain It is pure thick dark blood He backs away into
the hallway

INT HALLWAY

Ed backs into the wall and then losing strength in his legs lowers
himself to the floor He keeps watching the bathtub

Piano music starts to seep through the gurgling noises Ed turns
towards Eves room

On the other side of the house outside the

broken door Ed can hear Derms car pull up Ed watches the living
room

as Derm comes in carefully flanked by Mazurek and Snyder

Derm comes over to Ed and kneels down in front of him Ed looks up at
him helplessly

ED

It wasnt me

Derm looks at Eds hands which are covered in blood

ED

It wasnt me

Ed watches Derm looking at him Then he notices behind Derm blood
seeping over the rim of the bathtub

Ed turns to Eves room where the piano can still be heard
The camera continues on where Ed cant go down
the hallway to Eves room As it approaches all the other noises fade
out and the piano is all that we hear

Ed watches from his position in the hall so that it all seems like his
point of view

INT EVES ROOM

The camera comes into Eves room and turns to the piano

EVE is sitting at the piano playing some music
We watch her for a few seconds She turns to the camera as she plays
then continues playing

Then the camera turns toward the clouds painted

on the ceiling A crack appears in the plaster and starts widening
until there is an empty black space behind it The sound of the baby
crying seeps in from the crack The camera zeroes in on this black
until it fills the frame Over the blackness we can hear the baby
crying until it fades out

THE END
