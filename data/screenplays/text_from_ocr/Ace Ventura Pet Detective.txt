A UPS Man with a big pot belly is walking down the street whistling
and carelessly tossing a

package in the air We hear the sound of broken glass in the box He
passes a professional woman

UPS MAN

Good morning UPS

He tosses the box behind his back like a basketball then acknowledges
another passerby

UPS MAN

He takes a couple of steps then flings the package incredibly high
into the air spins completely

around and expertly drops to one knee and catches the box A Hispanic
man passes

UPS MAN

tail and whines We can see

that he likes the UPS guy
UPS MAN

GRUFF MAN

(mumbles)

The UPS Man bends down and talks to the dog in a really sucky pet
talk

Before the Gruff Man can finish the UPS Man stands back up and takes
the form again

The dog doesnt budge and this really pisses him off He gets up and
heads for the dog

GRUFF MAN

He roughly picks the dog up by the scruff of the neck but as he turns
it around we see that it isa

stuffed dog Around its neck is a business card that reads You have
been had by Ace Ventura -

Pet Detective He breathes fire

GRUFF MAN

Son of a bitch
He smashes the dog to the ground

the passenger seat

ACE (CONTD)

He then pulls open the cars ashtray and to the dogs delight its
filled with puppy chow

He tries to start the engine but it wont turn over The dog shoots
him a look

ACE

Warning Assholes are closer than

She cuts Ace off with a devastating kiss

WOMAN

Would you like me to take you

Suddenly the water is illuminated by the headlights of an nd panel
truck

The rear door slides open Two men jump out in wet suits
They slip into the water while a third waits outside the tank

Snowflake surfaces to check out the action One of the men holds out a
fish Snowflake eagerly

takes it then shudders as a large syringe is stuck into his back
Snowflake thrashes around

Quick cut of a hand with the blur of a ring slamming against the tank
But the needle has done its

job Snowflake quickly goes limp

Snowflake is loaded into the back of the truck Move in on Snowflakes
face His excited cackle

has turned into a painful whimper

The truck skids away passing the guard gate The guard is hog tied and
gagged struggling to free

himself

INT CAMPS MANSION - FISH TANKS - CONT

Ace browses through a myriad of dramatically lit salt water tanks
still singing Theyre all filled

with colorful exotic fish Very impressive but nothing large enough
to house a dolphin He

continues on towards a large door
INT TANK ROOM - SECONDS LATER

A huge above-ground tank is covered with curtains to discourage
onlookers Ace swings open the

large door and enters

Gravy

Ace climbs a ladder on the side of the tank singing more intensely
now The ladder leads to a

narrow catwalk over the center of the water Ace grabs a feeder fish
from a pail and walks

carefully out there
CLOSE ON ACE THIS IS IT

He looks into the dark pool but sees nothing Now he stops singing
quietly squats down and

dangles the fish over the water
ACE

(gently)

Ace takes the stone out of his pocket and studies it intensely

ACE

MELISSA

Hiring you was the biggest mistake

ACE

So small So unnoticeable Yet
an invaluable piece of our
twisted little jigsaw puzzle

Melissa stares at Ace like hes gone crazy There is a flash of
headlights and a car horn Melissa

swerves back into her own lane Ace drops the stone somewhere on the
seat and begins to search

for it frantically

ACE

Damn it

(to Melissa)

Try to keep it on the road
INT MELISSAS LIVING ROOM

CARLSON

Evening maam I wonder if you

could answer a few questions about

the deceased

Ace slips away we follow him as he eavesdrops on conversations
NEIGHBOR

(to a cop)

told you I was across the hall
in my apartment I heard a scream
The door was locked so I called

the manager

The Manager reiterates her story to the cop The Manager is about 100
years old

MANAGER

The place was empty except for

the damn dog in the other room

Then I opened the balcony door

looked over the railing

and splat bang pancake time

Ace continuing his investigation notices

in perfect order

Next he notices police coming in and out of the balcony closing the
door behind them shutting
out the noise

EINHORN

Who let Dr Doolittle in
Emilio steps in immediately

EMILIO

Ah Lieutenant He came with Miss
Robinson â€”-

EINHORN

This is official police business
Well let you know if the coroner
finds any ticks

Cops snicker

I just thought since Melissa -

ACE

E forget it Shes right

Besides I wouldnt want someone

tracing my steps and pointing out

all the mistakes I made

Ace crosses to

EXT PODACTERS BALCONY - CONT

Ace examines the area Einhorn is in hot pursuit

EINHORN

Oh so you dont think this in an
obvious suicide Mr Pet
Detective

ACE

Well I wouldnt say that Lord

knows there is plenty of evidence

here to support your theory

except of course that spot of

blood on the balcony

On the railing sure enough there is a tiny spot of blood

Einhorn glares at a couple of nearby cops They look down
ACE

May I tell you what I think
happened Alrighty then
Ace moves as he talks

ACE

Roger Podacter went out after
work He had a few drinks and he
came home But he wasnt alone
Someone was with him in this
apartment There was a struggle
and then Roger Podacter was thrown
over that balcony Roger Podacter
didnt commit suicide He was
murdered

A beat as everyone considers this

EINHORN

Well thats a very entertaining
story but real detectives have to
worry about that little thing

lawyers call evidence

Ace picks up a lottery ticket on Podacters desk and becomes
condescending kid show host
ACE

Lets take a trip to clue

corner shall we Can anyone tell
me why a man buys a lottery ticket
on the day he is going to commit
suicide Or why the family pet
suffering from acute canine
trauma clawed at the bedroom door
until his paws bled How about

the blood on the railing Ill

bet if we put our thinking caps on
well see that it was the result
of the struggle that took place
inside this apartment while Mr
Podacter was still alive

(singing)

NEXT TIME YOU DONT HAVE A CLUE
COME ON BACK TO CLUE CORNER BOOP
Everyone looks to Einhorn

EINHORN

Not a bad try for a pet detective

but not near conclusive enough for
us real investigators

(beat)

First people buy lottery tickets
everyday Its a habit It
doesnt prove a thing Second
the dog wasnt suffering from
canine trauma he was suffering
from bladder trauma Sergeant
Neilson found a piss stain as big
as Lake Huron near the bed And
third the blood on the railing
Simple He doesnt jump far
enough and whacks his head A
fact confirmed by the paramedics

who found cuts on his scalp with

traces of a white chalky
substance ie plaster from the
balcony

Einhorn shows Ace the paramedics report Everyone is impressed with
Einhorn

EINHORN

So much for your murder Ventura

AGUADO
Uh oh I think I heard a toilet

flush Maybe someone lost their
turtle

Everyone has a laugh Ace looks beaten

ACE

Well maybe Im just a little out
of my league here Einhorn
Ace holds out his hand Einhorn shakes it

good work
Ace and Melissa head for the door

ACE

Oh there is just one more thing

neighbor He lives across the
hall He said he heard a scream

The neighbor nods Ace turns to the apartment

manager
ACE

And you said you had to open the
balcony door when you keyed into
the room

MANAGER

Thats right
Ace walks out onto the balcony and turns

ACE

Youre certain you had to open
this door
She nods

EINHORN

Whats the point Ventura

ACE

Only this
AAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWW

Ace sustains an incredible Pavorati note
and closes the glass door

facing them

while he repeatedly opens

between them When the door is closed nothing can be heard

ACE
(tapping the door)

This is double paned sound-
proofed glass Theres no way
this neighbor could have heard
Podacter scream on the way down

with this door shut The scream

he heard came from inside this
apartment before Podacter was
thrown over the railing And the
muderer closed the door before he
left

Yes Yesss I have exorcised the
demons

and foam coming out of his

mouth and just before I got to

and sunk his teeth in Then I
woke up and felt the back of my

show Marino is tied to a football tackling sled The two thugs take
turns running into Dan with

their shoulders driving him back five feet each time

and FIRES

We see the bullet miss

Snowflake swims wildly

HOLLERS

Einhorn turns to Ace

EINHORN

SHUT UP

ACE

BLUE FORTY-TWO
Einhorn shoots at Ace

ACE

Snowflake under water

She FIRES again Misses again

He dives out of the way

Suddenly

She aims the gun at Snowflake

Ace
HUT HUT

Suddenly Snowflake leaps out of the water and takes the gun out of
Einhorns hand like the trick

we saw earlier Snowflake swims around the pool with the gun in his
mouth

ACE

(smug)

Yes The highly trained dolphin
Perhaps the smartest mammal in the
animal kingdom See how he knew
exactly what I wanted him to do
as if our minds were somehow in
complete synchronization They
have been know to save men at sea
you know They have their own
language

(to Snowflake)

Snowflake Come here Snowflake

Bring me the gun

(makes dolphin sounds)

EEEEEE EEEEERE EEREEEE
Just like the trick in his routine however Snowflake swims around
the tank passes Ace then

hands the gun back to Einhorn He finishes with a tail walk
ACE

(under his breath)

Stupid fish
ON TV Miamis kicker boots a perfect field goal from fifty yards

JOHN MADDEN

He got all of his leg into that
one
The field goal kicker is hugged by his teammates

ACE

Good to see someone who doesnt
buckle under the pressure

MARINO

Yeah not like in 82 when we
choked
Einhorn walks to Ace and puts the gun against his head

EINHORN

What would you know about
pressure

ACE

Well Ive kissed a man

JOHN MADDEN (ON TV)

Of course theres never been a

more crucial kick than the famous

Kick heard round the world

The famous footage airs on TV They all turn to watch

JOHN MADDEN

I mean its clear to me that
it was a good hold Finkle just
booted it

EINHORN

The laces werent out THE LACES
WERENT OUT

Einhorn takes a shot at the screen creating a hole in Maddens
forehead Ace uses the moment to

smack the gun out of her hand

A HUGE NO-HOLDS-BARRED FIGHT ensues Ace and Einhorn punch each other
about the

face and stomach

Einhorn throws a punch at Ace Ace goes down
Einhorn goes for the loose gun Ace leaps and tackles her

They both crash into old rusty equipment raising a mountain of dust
Marino struggles all the

while trying to get free
Einhorn kicks Ace He flies into Marino

MARINO

Having a little trouble with the
lady Ace
ACE

(out of breath)

You dont understand shes a â€”

Einhorn grabs Ace throws him into a head lock and begins wailing on
his face

Meanwhile cops start arriving SWAT team members disperse onto the
catwalk as the fight

continues They try but cant get a bead on Ace as the two roll around
on the floor

More punches They fight up a flight of stairs then back down To the
amazement of the SWAT

team Ace and Einhorn slug it out as equals
AGUADO

(caught up)

Get him Lois

Now they crash through a plate glass window together Ace gets to his
knees first and wobbles
toward the gun Its the first clear shot the SWAT team has
EINHORN

(screaming)

Shoot him Shoot him

We all hear the guns cocked We see Ace in the rifle sights

fingers twitch on triggers
A loud voice comes from off camera

EMILIO

DONT SHOOT HOLD YOUR FIRE
Melissa is holding Emilios gun under his chin

MELISSA

Put down your guns or this cop
gets it
The SWAT team hesitates

MELISSA (CONTD)

I mean it
Much to Emilios surprise she cocks the gun
EMILIO

(whispers to Melissa)

Ah Melissa Thats a hair

had

We see
trigger

(loud to cops)

Shes not joking

The SWAT team leader signals his men They lower their guns

gets back to her feet

EINHORN

He kidnapped Snowflake He killed

Roger Podacter and he was about

to kill Dan Marino and me

ACE

Ho ho Fiction can be fun But
I find the reference section much
more enlightening

(doing his best Clarence Darrow)

For instance if you were to look
up â€˜professional footballs all
time bonehead plays you might
read about a Miami Dolphin kicker
named Ray Finkle who missed a
twenty-six yard field goal in the

closing seconds of Super Bowl

Einhorn
Seventeen

(in one breath)

What you wouldnt read about is
how Ray Finkle lost his mind and
was committed to a mental
institute only to escape and join
the police force under the assumed
identity of a missing hker
seducing her way to the top ina
diabolical plan to get even with
Dan Marino whom he blamed for the
entire thing

Ace gasps for air Everyone is totally confused

AGUADO

What the hell are you trying to
say

ACE

Shes not Lois Einhorn Shes Ray

Finkle Shes a man

EINHORN

Hes lying Shoot him
Ace walks over to her

ACE

Lets just see whos lying Would
a real woman have to wear one of
these

Ace dramatically pulls at Einhorns hair thinking its a wig
Einhorns head flies back The hair is

real Ace keeps tugging it
The SWAT team ready themselves

ACE (CONTD)

Boy thats really on there But
tell me this Would a real woman
be missing these

Ace rips open Einhorns blouse and reveals two beautiful feminine
breasts

The sharp shooters are tensing Ace is laughing nervously now

ACE

Ha ha ha That kind of surgery
can be done over the weekend But
I doubt if she could find the time
during her busy schedule to get

rid of Mr Knish
Ace rips off Einhorns skirt Einhorn now stands there fully nude She

appears to be the perfect
figure of a woman

ACE

Oooh boy

Ace looks at Melissa and Emilio and shrugs his shoulders
when it seems all is lost Dan

Then just

Marino who is back behind Einhorn motions for Ace to come over

MARINO

Psst Ace Come here
ACE

(to everyone)

Could you excuse me just a second
Ace goes to Dan Melissa still holds Emilio hostage

EINHORN

Shoot him Shoot him now
MELISSA

(to cops)

Dont anybody make a move

Marino whispers something in his ear Ace looks confident
once more addresses the

again He
crowd

ACE

Ladies and gentlemen my esteemed
colleague Mr Marino has just
brought some new evidence to my
attention Now history has
certainly shown that even the most
intuitive criminal minds can be
wrong from time to time But if
I have been mistaken if the
lieutenant is indeed a woman

then my friends she is suffering
from the worst case of hemorrhoids
I have ever seen

Ace spins Einhorn around now exposing to the world the healthy set
of male genetalia that Finkle

has learned to keep tucked between his legs (And if we have any
balls well actually show it)

Everyone gasps CLOSE UP ON EINHORNFINKLE He finally drops the
facade

FINKLE

(deepest voice possible)

It was Marinos fault The laces

were in
breaking down now)

They were IN
Quick cuts of all the cops spitting with disgust Then Emilio spits

Then CLOSE ON Marino spitting They all have kissed herhimit Even
Snowflake blows his

spout
Ace confidently cracks a sunflower seed

ACE

Somebody read it its rights
Suddenly Finkle picks up a shard of broken glass and lunges at Ace

FINKLE

DIE ANIMAL Boyyyyy

Thinking fast Ace sidesteps Finkle and sends him head first into
Snowflakes makeshift tank After

a few seconds Finkle fights his way to the surface and thrashes
around helplessly

FINKLE

(gasping for air)

Help I cant swim
Finkle goes under again We see him under water sinking down

Snowflake swims to him now allowing him to grab onto his fin and
pulls Finkle gently to the side

of the pool Finkle lies there exhausted
Ace reaches down into frame removing the 82 AFC Championship ring
from Finkles finger We

see that its the ring with the missing stone Ace replaces it with
the stone in his pocket Its a

perfect fit

ACE

LLLOOOSER LLOO HOO SERR HERR
HERR
Melissa is still holding the gun on Emilio

EMILIO

Melissa you can give me back my

gun now

Melissa has forgotten she even had the gun She hands it to Emilio and
faints in his arms

Now Aguado appears beside Ace

AGUADO

I dont know how you did it
Ventura but that was damn good
police work Alright guys lets
wrap this up

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

Twenty or more police cars in single file provide more than ample
escort for
Ace and Marino in Aces Chevy Bel-Aire with the cracked windshield
Both of them have their

heads sticking out so that they can see Marino has a wad of gum in
his mouth

HIGH ANGLE

The long line of flashing lights and cop cars drives at top speed up
Route One Aces Bel-Aire

right in the middle

CUT TO
INT STADIUM - DAY

The Super Bowl Halftime Show is in progress Marino is in uniform
warming up Emilio is

drooling at the cheerleaders Ace and Melissa are standing near the
fifty yard line taking in the

awesome spectacle

Some fireworks go off around the tank A marching band plays a
triumphant tune We see a

helicopter come up over the side of the stadium carrying Snowflake

ANNOUNCER (0OS)
Ladies and gentlemen the Miami
Dolphins are proud to welcome back

beloved mascot and star of the

halftime show

ANGLE ON

The helicopter lowering Snowflake into his tank

ANNOUNCER (0OS)

Snowflake

As the crowd roars Melissa turns to Ace and with Snowflake in the
background performing

spectacular flips they kiss
ANOTHER ANGLE

As Melissa and Ace kiss the prized White Pigeon lands on a Gatorade
dispenser in the

foreground Ace spots it and starts to make a move

Just as he closes in for the grab the Philadelphia Eagles mascot
eagle walks up to get a drink and

shoos the pigeon away Ace is furious

ACE

You idiot Do you know what
youve done

The giant eagle head looks up at Ace
MASCOT

Huh
Ace grabs him

ACE

You just cost me ten thousand
bucks Polly

MASCOT

Yeah Blow me

ACE

REE HEE HEE HEELYYY

PULL BACK to find Eagles mascot and Ace arguing We cant hear whats
said but theres a lot

of finger pointing
Emilio stops his leering to check out whats going on
The ANNOUNCER up in the booth reads a release

ANNOUNCER

The National Football League would
now like to offer a special thank
you to the man who rescued Dan

Marino and our beloved
Snowflake
On the field the mascot shoves Ace Ace shoves back

ANNOUNCER (CONTD)

A great humanitarian and lover of
all animals Mr Ace Ventura

this huge picture of Ace as he

looks into camera with his fist raised
