INT BISHOPS HOUSE DAY
A landing at the top of a crooked wooden staircase There
a threadbare braided rug on the floor There is a long

corridor decorated with faded paintings of sailboats and
battleships The wallpapers are sun-bleached and peeling at
the corners except for a few newly-hung strips which are
clean and bright A small easel sits stored in the corner

Outside a hard rain falls drumming the roof and rattling
the gutters

A ten-year-old boy in pajamas comes up the steps carefully
eating a bowl of cereal as he walks He is Lionel Lionel
slides open the door to a low cabinet under the window He
takes out a portable record player puts a disc on the
turntable and sets the needle into the spinning groove

A childs voice says over the speaker

RECORD PLAYER (VO)

In order to show you how a big symphony
orchestra is put together Benjamin
Britten has written a big piece of music
which is made up of smaller pieces that
show you all the separate parts of the
orchestra

As Lionel listens three other children wander out of their
bedrooms and down to the landing

The first is an eight-year-old boy in a bathrobe He is
Murray The second is a nine-year-old boy in white boxer
shorts and a white undershirt He is Rudy The third is a

The boys drop down to the floor next to their brother They
lie on their stomachs with their chins propped up on their
fists listening

Suzy sits in the windowsill She opens a book called Shelly
and the Secret Universe There is an illustration on the
cover of a young gymnast with a glowing amulet around her
neck

Suzy starts to read -- then pauses She lowers her book She
raises a pair of junior binoculars to her eyes She looks

into the rain

EXT BISHOPS HOUSE DAY
A rickety three-story stone-and-shingle house on a

creaking on the roof Tree tops sway in a cluster below The
sea is almost invisible in the misting rain and the

watching

NARRATOR
This is the island of New Penzance
Sixteen miles long Forested with old-
growth pine and maple Criss-crossed by
shallow tidal creeks An important
seabird habitat There are no paved roads
but instead many miles of intersecting
foot paths and dirt trails and a ferry
that runs twice daily from Stone Cove
The year is 1965 We are on the far edge
of Black Beacon Sound famous for the
ferocious and well-documented storm which
will strike from the east on the fifth of

September -- in three days time

center aisle The beams are draped with garlands A large

EXT CHURCH YARD EVENING

Troops flood out from one side of the church while children
in animal costumes flood out from the other They criss-

Sam frowns and squints He points

SAM
Did you bring a cat

Suzy nods Sam smiles Suzy smiles Sam takes a folded map
out of his pocket He signals for Suzy to come closer

SAM
Can you read a map

SUZY
Uh-huh

SAM
I do cartography

Sam points to one of the patches on his sash It has a
protractor embroidered on it He unfolds the map

SAM
I feel we should go halfway today and
halfway tomorrow since youre a less
experienced hiker and youre wearing
Sunday-school shoes

SUZY
OK

SAM
(pointing on the map)
Heres where we are right now Id like
to pitch camp here by sixteen-hundred
(which means four oclock) How does that
sound

SUZY
Fine

SAM
You want some beef jerky

SUZY
OK

Sam tears a strip of dried meat in two and gives half to
Suzy She tries to chew on it Sam nods

SAM
Lets go

MONTAGE

Sam and Suzy walk together down a hill across a field and
through a wooded path eating beef jerky They both smile
continuously

SAM
Are you thirsty

SUZY
No

SAM
Well if your throat gets parched stick
a pebble in your mouth and suck on it
You can quench your thirst with the spit
supposedly

Sam shows Suzy some bits of green and yellow sticking out
from under his coonskin cap

SAM
Sometimes I stick leaves under my hat It
cools your head down

SUZY
Thats a good idea It might help also if
you didnt wear fur

SAM
(HESITATES)
True but this adds camouflage

Sam stands in a clearing and pulls a handful of dry grass

He
holds it in his fist
SAM
Heres a trick Throw grass in the air
and you can see which direction the
winds blowing
Sam throws up the grass It swirls and drifts vaguely Suzy
squints
SUZY
Which way
SAM
Unknown I guess it doesnt really
matter as long as we cover our tracks

Sam and Suzy stop to investigate and discuss a patch of
mushrooms moss on a stump ferns poison ivy and a low
bush

with purple fruit Sam looks skeptical

SAM
These might be poisonous

SUZY

(STUDYING THEM)
No theyre huckleberries in fact Try
one

Suzy brushes off some dirt and eats a berry Sam puts one
into his mouth and nods

SAM
Not bad Anyway theyre good for
survival

Sam and Suzy look through Suzys binoculars at a deer
drinking from a stream Suzy whispers

SUZY
He knows someones watching him

SAM
I agree Why do you say that
snake

SUZY

(SQUINTING)
I dont know I just think he can feel
us

Sam and Suzy walk across a fallen tree over a stream A

swims on the surface below them Sam assists Suzy onto the
far bank

SAM
You smell like perfume

SUZY
Its my mothers

Sam picks up two pebbles He and Suzy both put them in their
mouths They click against their teeth

SAM
I brought water too

Sam and Suzy watch a small green worm wriggling in the air
swaying from a silk thread They stare wide-eyed Suzy cups
her hand a few inches below it and moves it around in a
circle Sam shrugs

SAM
Should we catch him

SUZY
(HESITATES)

SAM
Trout bait We need worms

SUZY
(SHARPLY)
No

Pause The worm curls and uncurls itself gently Sam nods

SAM
Youre right Well let him live Maybe
Ive got a licorice whip

boxes and suitcases are arranged around a small tent

decorated with more tribal symbols The kitten is asleep
Sam

and Suzy stand at the waters edge as he removes the

camouflage net from the canoe and says gravely

SAM
How strong of a swimmer are you

SUZY
Pretty good I broke our school record
for the back-stroke

SAM

(MILDLY SURPRISED)
OK Well Im not that strong of a
swimmer so I wear a life-preserver I

Watch out for turtles Theyll bite you
if you put your fingers in their mouths
Let me see if I can catch this one

Sam dips a net into the lake and brings it up with a small
turtle in it He lifts it out of the net It has red and
yellow markings and a slightly damaged shell Sam flips it
over The word Albert is written on the underside of the
turtle in magic marker Sam says blankly

SAM
Somebody wrote on him
dash

The fishing pole jerks in Suzys hands She yells

SUZY
The sticks moving

SAM
(ALERTED)
You got one

Sam jumps to his feet and heaves the turtle with two hands
It sails through the air across the pond and splashes down
with a whack Sam yells an announcement

SAM
Fish on hook

(TO SUZY)
Reel him in Slowly

The canoe rocks violently Suzy snaps

SUZY
Sit down

Sam sits back down Suzy winds the reel carefully Sam says
GENTLY ENCOURAGING

SAM
Youre doing good

Sam points to one of the patches on his sash It has a rod
and reel embroidered on it

SAM
This is for fishing

EXT LAKE SHORE DUSK

Sam twists a stick with a shoelace in kindling and builds a
small camp-fire circled with rocks He cooks two fish with
bologna in a frying pan over a camp-fire He throws ina

of salt grinds some pepper and flips the fish in the air

He holds out a bite on a spatula to Suzy sitting on a log

next to him She tastes it She looks surprised and nods
ENTHUSIASTICALLY

(STIFFENING)

for

Sam points to one of the patches on his sash It has fried
eggs and bacon on it

Sam serves the fish onto two tin plates He says as they eat
with folding forks

SAM
We can feed your cat the guts and
eyeballs

Sam points to a pile of bloody organs and bones on a page of
newspaper Suzy frowns

SUZY
Thats OK He only eats cat food

Suzy points to a cardboard box Sam looks inside It is
filled with ten cans of cat food Sam raises an eyebrow

SAM
What else did you bring We should make
an inventory

SUZY
OK

Sam flips open a small spiral-bound note-book

SAM
Go ahead

Suzy opens the top of her portable record player She
displays it like a salesman

SUZY
This is my record player It works with
batteries Actually it belongs to my
little brother Lionel I left him a note
Do you like music

Sam nods and makes a note Suzy opens her leather folder
There are three LP records in it She takes out one by a
French singer

SUZY
This is my favorite record album My
godmother gave it to me for my birthday
She lives in France

Sam nods and makes another note Suzy opens her suitcase It

is filled to the brim with hard-back copies of fantasy
books

It contains no other items of any kind (including clothing)

SUZY
These are my books I like stories with
magic powers in them Either in kingdoms
on earth or on foreign planets Also
time-travel if they make it realistic
Usually I prefer a girl hero but not
always I couldnt bring all of them
because it got too heavy You can borrow
any you want

Sam nods and makes another note Suzy produces a few more
ITEMS

SUZY
I also brought my lefty scissors because
Im left-handed my toothbrush some
rubber bands extra batteries and my
binoculars as you know I forgot my
comb

Sam surveys the entire collection of articles He scratches
his head

SAM
Thats it No mess-kit No flashlight No
canteen No waterproof matches Didnt

last letter

SUZY

(FROWNS )

SAM
Thats OK We can share

Sam picks up one of the books It is called The Girl from
Jupiter There is an illustration on the cover of a young
alien princess with glittering tears on her cheeks Sam
examines the other books in the suitcase He looks slightly
puzzled

SAM
These are all library books In my school
youre only allowed to check-out one at a
time Some of these are going to be
overdue

Sam hesitates He suddenly realizes something He asks
BLUNTLY

SAM
Do you steal

Silence Suzy nods reluctantly Sam looks confused

SAM
Why Youre not poor

Suzy stares at the books She absently brushes some dust off
them She rearranges them slightly She says finally

SUZY
I might turn some of them back in one
day I havent decided yet I know its
bad I think I just took them to have a
secret to keep Anyway for some reason
it makes me feel in a better mood
sometimes

Sam thinks about this He leans his chin against his fist
SAYS SERIOUSLY

SAM
Are you depressed

Suzy bites her fingernails She shrugs
SAM

How come

Pause Suzy says philosophically

SUZY

Well I can show you an example if you

want -- but it doesnt make me feel very
good I found this on top of our
refrigerator

pages She withdraws a small pamphlet

cup and the title Coping with the Very Troubled Child

SAM
Does that mean you

Suzy nods Sam explodes with laughter

SUZY
Its not funny

SAM
To me it is

Sam slaps his knee and shakes his head Pause Suzy dumps

fish into the campfire and throws her metal plate like a
frisbee into a tree trunk It bounces off with a ding She
stands up and says coolly

SUZY
You really know how to make friends

Suzy walks away She goes behind a bush and sits down on a
rock She starts to cry Sam looks stricken and confused He
is very still He gets up slowly He tentatively approaches
the bush He looks behind it He takes two steps closer He
stands above Suzy He unties his neckerchief crouches down
and holds it out

SAM
Im sorry

Suzy looks to Sam She hesitates She takes the neckerchief

SUZY
Thats OK

SAM
Im on your side

SUZY

Suzy dries her eyes She unfolds the neckerchief and studies

its design It is a brave shooting an arrow while leaning
off

the side of a galloping horse Sam motions to the books

SAM
Which ones the best

Cut TO

Dusk Sam lies on his back on one of the bedrolls smoking
his

pipe while Suzy sits Indian-style next to him She reads

aloud from a book called The Francine Odyssies There is an

illustration on the cover of an enormous panther with a

bloody sword walking behind a small girl in a nightgown

SUZY
His eyes downcast his kingdom in ruins
Mynar pressed his heavy paw through the
rippling surface of the cool shallows and
down to its stone floor My people once
were lead by a great and noble beast --
and I no longer see his face in this
reflection

Suzy looks to Sam He is asleep She takes the pipe out of
his mouth and tips the ashes into the camp-fire She draws a
blanket over his chest She continues

Captain Sharp Scout Master Ward and Mr and Mrs Bishop
stop fighting and turn around at once They see the
narrator He stands at the foot of the dock holding a

blankly He continues

NARRATOR
As some of you know I taught Sam for the
cartography Accomplishment Patch Hes a
smart boy and he expressed a keen
interest in the history of the islands
indigenous peoples In particular I
recall his fascination with the idea of
retracing the original path of the old
Chickchaw harvest migration

Long pause Everyone looks utterly perplexed The propeller
of the seaplane starts up and they all shield their eyes
from the blast of wind and dust The narrator hesitates He
yells over the noise

know where theyre going

A small cove enclosed by a low rocky cliff It forms an
almost complete circle and is overgrown with vines flowers
and branches A thin channel leads out to the ocean The

on the shore is white and the water is perfectly clear and
crowded with shells at the bottom Birds echo and fly from
tree to tree

Sams and Suzys luggage is piled on the beach The kitten
wanders exploring The lid of the portable record player is
open The voice of Leonard Bernstein says over the speaker

RECORD PLAYER (VO)

Onto the bird-house where every kind of
bird imaginable is whirling and wheeling
around This is a real acrobatic act for
our gifted young flute player Paula
Robeson

As they listen Sam and Suzy take off their shoes and socks

and run in opposite directions around the edge of the cove

They each climb up a rock over the water They look at each

other across the lagoon They both laugh Suzy shouts
SMILING

SUZY
This is weird

Sam takes off his coon-skin cap and throws it aside Suzy
removes her cardigan and drops it on the ground Sam strips
off his uniform down to his white briefs Suzy take off
everything except her underwear and a training bra They
throw their clothes into the water Sam yells

theyre not very far away I pretend its
my magic power

just supposed to be creative

Suzy gives Sam the binoculars He points them at her and
stares

couldnt think of anything as good as it
On the other hand maybe well get blown

brooch pinned to Sams shirt

SUZY
Whats that one for

Sam looks at the brooch He shakes his head

SAM
Its not an accomplishment I inherited
it from my mother Its actually not
meant for a male to wear -- but I dont
give a damn

Suzy nods thoughtfully Pause

SUZY
Are your foster parents still mad at you
For getting in trouble so much

SAM
I dont think so Were getting to know
each other better I feel like Im ina
family now Not like yours but similar
to one

my favorite characters are I think your
lives are more special

on one of the bedrolls smoking his pipe while Suzy sits
Indian-style next to him She reads aloud from a book called

ribbon of smoke curls between its fingers

Social Services frowns She asks calmly

SOCIAL SERVICES
Whos speaking

SCOUT MASTER WARD
This is Scout Master Ward

Social Services refers to a document in her file-folder She
nods

Right An orphanage -- but the first step
is the admissions panel requires a
psychological evaluation to determine
whether or not the boys a candidate for
institutional treatment or electroshock
therapy Beyond that --

be necessary Hes not violent

didnt do on purpose When we first met
each other Something happened to us

Captain Sharp stirs the sausages in the pan He nods He
SERIOUSLY

CAPTAIN SHARP
I agree with you Thats eloquent I
cant argue against anything youre

Captain Sharp brings the skillet to the table and serves
three links onto one plate and three onto another He sits
down

Look lets face it youre probably a
much more intelligent person than I am

kids sometimes stick their fingers in
electrical sockets if you see what I
mean It takes time to figure things out
Its been proven by history all mankind
makes mistakes Its our job to try to
protect you from the dangerous ones If
we can

splintering thud Skotak hesitates He moves a half-step

from a book called Annabelles Midnight There is an
illustration on the cover of a blonde girl climbing out a
window onto a trellis with fireflies circling around her

briskly out a door and onto a cat-walk that runs along the
top of a wall made from tall pointed logs As they talk
they walk past dozens of rows and clusters of tents grouped
by color in the fields below They walk past towers huts
ladders latrines and a catapult under construction They
walk past a white infirmary with a red cross on it anda
doctor taking a boys blood pressure They walk past a fleet
of small antique sailboats flying assorted troop banners
Five hundred scouts and fifty scout masters work eat talk
cook and play sports and games all around the compound in

Sam and Suzy shake their heads Cousin Ben nods He speaks
more gently now

COUSIN BEN
I cant offer you a legally binding
union It wont hold up in the state the
county or frankly any courtroom in the
world due to your age lack of a license
and failure to get parental consent --
but the ritual does carry a very
important moral weight within yourselves
You cant enter into this lightly Do you
love each other

Sam and Suzy immediately nod Cousin Ben continues

COUSIN BEN
Are you sure youre ready for this

Sam and Suzy immediately nod Cousin Ben looks perturbed
