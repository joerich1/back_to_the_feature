FIERCE INVALIDS HOME FROM HOT CLIMATES

FADE IN
EXT VATICAN CITY - DAY

A peaceful placid garden within Vatican City Birds chirp
And HIS HOLINESS THE POPE greets a line of priests and nuns
Down the line a well-traveled world-weary man sits ina
wheelchair dressed in a nun’s habit This is SWITTERS

Title card VATICAN CITY ROME
last week

Switters motions to a nun who leans over to hear him

SWITTERS
The only way I’m kissing that
ring is if they cover it with
pussy juice

The nun frowns

EXT CENTRAL SYRIAN DESERT —- DAY

The hot sun burns down on a caravan of Bedouin nomads Their
camels carry heavy loads One of the riders tucks the tip of a
rocket launcher back under his tunic

Title card SOMEWHERE ON THE ROAD TO JEBEL AL QAZAZ SYRIA

Switters is one of the riders bringing up the rear They pass
a stony compound surrounded by a high wall the only edifice
in this barren landscape Lifting up in his saddle Switters
sees tree-tops over the walls and hears sounds of female
laughter coming from within He stops

TRIBESMAN
Oh no sir We must not turn back

SWITTERS
I’m going alone

TRIBESMAN
But sir the camel We have only
seven camels
SWITTERS
Tell your father the Khan I do
not intend to take his camel Now
if you’ll be so kind to help me

He motions to a folded wheelchair strapped behind his camel

The tribesmen lower Switters into the wheelchair and place his
alligator-skin valise on his lap Switters clasps their hands
double-kisses the tribal leader and pushes off maneuvering
his wheelchair over the rocky landscape towards the compound
and the laughing girlish voices

SWITTERS

(singing to himself)
“Meet me in St Looey Looey
Meet me at the fair
Don’t tell me the lights are
shining anywhere but there
We’ll dance the hoochie-coochie
You’ll be my tootsie-wootsie
If you’ll meet me in St Looey
Meet me at the fair”

EXT PERUVIAN JUNGLE - DAY

A MACHETE BREAKS THROUGH the thick jungle brush and Switters
steps into a clearing wearing a panama hat and sweat-stained
linen suit No wheelchair He stops to consider an enormous

moth spread out on a branch before him

Title card BOQUICHICOS PERU
several months earlier

Native voices approach A short Peruvian guide with a bowl
haircut (INTI) holding a machete in one hand and Switters’
alligator valise in the other comes up behind Switters who is
transfixed by the moth It’s large plump and powdery white

SWITTERS
This insect is making me feel
what’s the word

Inti smiles It’s gap-toothed

INTI
Meester meester This way meester

SWITTERS (VO)
The boy spoke possibly twelve words
of English He would be of no help
SWITTERS
Yes I’ve got it This insect is
making me feel libidinous

Inti blinks

SWITTERS (VO)
I’ve gotten a little ahead of
myself here Let me try to do
a better job of weaving this
yarn in some sort of coherent
and chronological order

EXT SEATTLE CITYSCAPE - DAY

Title card SEATTLE WASHINGTON
before all that

A foggy day in Seattle town as we cruise over landmarks of the
city like the fog off Puget Sound We end our tour on a grande
olde Victorian house on a hill in the Magnolia District

SWITTERS (VO) (CONT)
From here on out I’11 be good I
promise I’1l keep on the straight
and narrow eschewing the natural
tangential influence of my mind
stopping only occasionally to
smell the odd adjective or kick
some ass

INT SWITTERS BEDROOM - DAY

The décor may be described as post-Medieval Switters sits at
his desk under a giant tapestry wearing a house-robe and
snowman boxer shorts He types into a laptop computer

SWITTERS (VO) (CONT )
I was home recuperating from my
latest failed mission I should
say between failed missions
There seemed to be a whole string
of them lately Somewhere somehow
I’d lost my touch My heart just
wasn’t in it anymore The vim was
out of my voom If you’d asked
I’d have said consumer confidence
was at an all-time low

HE TYPES AN IM -- “Who is this Brian character”
RESPONSE -- “SUZY Just a friend”

HE TYPES -- “Is he why you’re not coming home straight
school I bet he’s an athlete”

SWITTERS (VO) (CONT )
Technically it wasn’t my home
it was my grandmother’s but with
all the moving around in my life
it’s the only home I’ve ever
known Incidentally don’t let
her hear I called her grandmother
She hates that word It’s Maestra
And I’m Switters

RESPONSE -- “SUZY What’s gotten into you petunia”
SWITTERS
(aloud)

I’m in love with you dammit

That’s the rub
RESPONSE -- “SUZY URAPITA”

SWITTERS (CONT )
URAPITA What the hell does that
mean

His cellphone rings He answers

SWITTERS
You are on a secure line

VOICE
There’s a mole in our section

SWITTERS
Oh hello Bobby

INT HELICOPTER - DAY

after

BOBBY CASE CIA Operative and Switters’ Senior Case Officer
is in a low-flying helicopter chasing down a man on foot

SWITTERS
And what would make you say that

BOBBY CASE
I just tortured it out of a guy
Wily bastard got away before I
could get a name out of him
INT SWITTERS BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Switters stares at the screen not all that concerned

SWITTERS
Other than that everything well

BOBBY CASE
Never better But this is why our
Intel’s been shit We’ve got to
find this mole So keep your eyes
out Gotta go

SWITTERS
Wait a minute URAPITA Mean
anything to you

BOBBY CASE
Lemme think hang on

SHOTS ARE FIRED Switters holds the phone away from his ear

BOBBY CASE
Uhm You Are A Pain In The Ass

SWITTERS
Right of course Thanks

BOBBY CASE
Have a nice day

He hangs up

MAESTRA (0S)

Switters
SWITTERS
One minute
SWITTERS TYPES -- “I may be a PITA but you have to admit it’s

a GOOD PAIN Gotta go C U at dinner”

MAESTRA (0S)
Switters

He logs off -- the CIA emblem is his background image -- and
walks out of his bedroom leaning over the railing to an
indoor courtyard

SWITTERS
Yes
Down below stands MAESTRA a braceleted Grande Dame herself in
a long flowing muumuu and headwrap She looks like a 1920s
diva or aging drag queen She waives a stack of papers at him

MAESTRA
Switters come down here this
instant I wish to speak with you
about something

INT MAESTRA’S LIBRARY - DAY

On her desk are framed photos of a young girl in a high-school
uniform (SUZY) There are also some of Switters in various
exotic locales

Maestra sits on the couch the papers on her lap Switters
sits across from her Over his shoulder amongst the
collectables is a parrot in a triangular cage

MAESTRA
You’re a wicked degenerate A
rascal a wastrel and a pervert

SWITTERS
And a good morning to you
Maestra

MAESTRA

Such a tragic waste of genius
The pride of Berkeley Did you
know the Dean of students
personally told me you broke the
bank when it came to cybernetics
and linguistics

SWITTERS
Don’t forget my nine hours of
modern poetry

MAESTRA
And look what you’ve become

SWITTERS
Well you can hardly say I’ma
slouch I’m a dedicated decorated
public servant with top-secret
security clearance and I happen to
know the word for a womans
private parts in seventy-one
different languages
SWITTERS (VO)
I really do It’s kind of a hobby

MAESTRA
Am I supposed to sleep better at
nights knowing the likes of you
are guarding the henhouse It
amazes me they ever recruited
you in the first place

SWITTERS
Perhaps it was my firm jaw and
air of tragic nobility

MAESTRA
Or weak moral fiber

SWITTERS
It’s government service Maestra
Morality’s got nothing to do with
it So what’s this all about

Maestra lowers her eyes at him The gaze of an oil tanker as
seen from a tug boat

MAESTRA
Suzy

SWITTERS
What about her

MAESTRA
She’s your sister for God’s sake

SWITTERS
Step-sister

MAESTRA
She’s eighteen

SWITTERS
Yes

MAESTRA

So keep your hands off her

SWITTERS
I resent that accusation In
fact like a Knight-errant I am
a protector of her virginity
Although I will say that in
some cultures-—
MAESTRA
Not this one Mister

SWITTERS
I admit there is a certain
irresistible appeal about her
It’s the innocence

She waves the stack of papers

MAESTRA
I don’t think these emails sound
so innocent

SWITTERS
How did you get those My email’s
encrypted by the US government

MAESTRA
I’ve hacked into Suzy’s account
It’s my network for Chrissake
Do you think I’m a rank amateur

SWITTERS
Clever

Maestra gets up and walks over to the window

Standoff

MAESTRA
I wonder who might find these
letters amusing Your employers
perhaps

SWITTERS
I hardly think they’d mind

MAESTRA
How about your mother and angry
step-father One whiff of this
to them and Suzy will be shipped
off to boarding school and you
will never see her again Not to
mention he would break every bone
in your body the brute

SWITTERS
You wouldn’t

MAESTRA
Wouldn’t I
SWITTERS

(breaking down)
Please don’t I just want to be
near her I can’t make it
through my day without knowing
that she’1ll be at the end of it
I promise no impropriety I just
want to admire her from afar

MAESTRA
That’s not good enough

SWITTERS
Well what is

MAESTRA
What’s your next assignment

SWITTERS
South America

MAESTRA

Knocking off some propped-up
dictator I suppose

SWITTERS
I’ve told you I don’t do windows
No The Company recruited a very
promising young agent down there
fronted him a new Honda and now
he’s having second thoughts
I’ve got to try to bring him
back into the fold

MAESTRA
You’re going to terminate him
with extreme prejudice

SWITTERS
No probably take him to lunch
Why

MAESTRA

Sailor Boy

Switters turns and looks over his shoulder at the parrot in
the cage

SWITTERS
What about him
MAESTRA

Sailor Boy your equal in age and
intelligence is getting on in
years He’s had a very good life
but I’m afraid he’s not long with
us and I’d like for him to live
his last feathered days in the
wild amongst his own kind

SWITTERS
Oh no

MAESTRA
I want you to release him
somewhere peaceful and safe
where he can be free to pursue
his avian interests until his
last squawk

SWITTERS
No way

MAESTRA
A quick detour that’s all I’m
asking Expand the pinhole on your
map Just take him up the Amazon

SWITTERS
“Just take him up the Amazon”
I’m going to Lima Lima’s on the
coast It’s hundreds of miles from
the Amazon Nope South America
holds a minimum of charm for this
buckaroo It’s too damn vivid I
am going in and out and not a
moment longer and nothing can
change my mind Sorry can’t do
it Maestra You’ve got your
burdens I’ve got mine

MAESTRA
That’s precisely your problem
Switters all you care about is
yourself

SWITTERS
Well it keeps me busy And alive
I’ve noticed that self-preservation
is the key to survival

MAESTRA
Your tone disappoints me

She walks over to her desk and picks up the phone

SWITTERS
Who are you calling

MAESTRA
Your step-father For your sake
I hope the traffic from
Sacramento is diabolical Should
give you a good head start

He gets up and takes the phone from her hanging it up
SWITTERS

Blackmail I’d think that would
be beneath you Maestra

MAESTRA
Don’t underestimate me That’s
age-ist
The bird moves suddenly in the cage -- they look at him

MAESTRA (CONT )
Clean up your life Switters You
look like the bottom of that cage

Switters pokes the cage The parrot shifts and squawks

SAILOR BOY
PEOPLE OF ZEE WORLD RELAX

INT DINING ROOM - EVENING

Maestra Switters and his stunning 18-year old step-sister
SUZY sit around the dining room table eating Thai food out the
boxes As billed Suzy is irresistible innocent and
untouchable in her High School uniform Switters sits across
from her clean and freshly showered wearing a Polo shirt with
a “CRAFT” crest He has a beaming unnatural smile

SWITTERS (VO)
Luckily the CIA has an unlimited
budget for recreational drugs many
of which including the Ecstasy I
popped just before dinner
actually make you feel good when
you probably should be feeling bad

An uncomfortable silence hangs over the table The environment
could be described as “strained” -- forks scrape plates
MAESTRA
Sit up straight Do you want to
be Quasimodo when you grow up

They both sit up in their chairs

MAESTRA (CONT )
So how was school today

SUZY
Sucky Everyone is incredibly lame
I can’t wait to start college

MAESTRA
Have you given any thought to a
major

SUZY
I’m thinking about religious
studies

Switters laughs

SUZY (CONT )
What’s wrong with that Switters

SWITTERS
Nothing if you believe in that
sort of thing

SUZY
Why do you always have to be so
negative Don’t you believe in
miracles and stuff

SWITTERS
It’s just that my credibility
alarm goes off when people start
living in whales and visions of
the Virgin Mary pop up on Wonder
Bread I thought this stuff was
supposed to make you happy

Back to the silence

SUZY
Let’s play a game

SWITTERS
Twister

Maestra stares at him icily
SUZY
No I mean like tell me something
about yourself that we don’t
already know Me and Bri- I
mean I played it with a friend
last weekend

SWITTERS
And what did your friend say
Lemme guess he wants to play
in the NFL

SUZY
Can’t tell you it’s a secret

MAESTRA
I was once seduced by both Laurel
and Hardy

SWITTERS
Wow well that’s something

SUZY
How about you Switters What
secret do you have to reveal to
us

Switters looks up at the ceiling pondering for a moment
SWITTERS
The more advertising I see the
less I want to buy
Beat
Suzy laughs at him

Switters joins in laughing unnaturally Maestra frowns

INT LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Maestra sleeps in a chair in front of the TV Suzy dances
around the room to punk music while Switters tries to keep up
His moves are jerky and awkward as he tries to find the beat

SUZY
What’s wrong Not your speed

SWITTERS
I’m an Oklahoma man myself
Broadway Showtunes Ever heard
of South Pacific Me and My Gal

SUZY

Sounds sucky to me

She dances around him

Switters backs up and KNOCKS INTO THE BIRDCAGE sending Sailor
Boy atwitter Switters grabs the cage just before it falls
over Parrott feathers fall to the floor and Sailor Boy is

hanging on by a beak

Switters looks over at Maestra who glares at him Switters
puts the cage back and begins dancing again with Suzy Maestra
settles back in the chair and WE PULL OUT OF THE WINDOW SEEING

THE TABLEAU FROM OUTSIDE THE HOUSE AND FADE TO

EXT CITY PLAZA - LIMA PERU - DAY

The city is gnarled in traffic

in every direction

Title card

At a table in an outdoor café
linen suit across from a young Peruvian HECTOR SUMAC

LIMA PERU

pours a glass of wine for him

SWITTERS (VO)
Hector Sumac was the prospective
agent and pisco was the vile local
potable

HECTOR
It is pisco Peruvian wine Good
no

SWITTERS
Quintessentially South American
So what seems to be the problem
Hector Why the cold feet
Problems with the car You know
you need to put gasoline in that
little hole in the back

SWITTERS (VO)
Forget what you’ve seen mine is
essentially a sales job Our pitch
is to convince someone that
betraying their country by telling
us secrets is in their best
interests My quota had been down
for some time and the top brass

(MORE)

-- bikes mopeds and cars going

Switters sits in his white

SWITTERS (VO) (contd)
back at the pickle factory were
starting to grumble But I knew
I could close this guy Was I
really losing my edge

HECTOR
It is a very difficult thing you
ask me to do to tell secrets from
from my government And dangerous

SWITTERS
Yes hence the Honda

HECTOR
Our federal administration is
completely corrupt

SWITTERS
Join the club

HECTOR
So despite your- how do you call
it “Company” Despite your
Company’s history of illegal
involvement in Latin American
affairs I will work for you
But Agent Switters-

SWITTERS
Actually I’m an Operative you’re
the Agent Doesn’t matter
continue

HECTOR
I wish to be completely honest
with you The truth is I do not
think I have the character
qualifications for the job

SWITTERS
And what qualifications are those

Hector leans closer
HECTOR
I am afraid the things I am most
interested are sex drugs and rock
‘n’ roll

Beat
SWITTERS
You’re perfect

A PROSTITUTE comes over and whispers something in Switters’
hear He nods leaning forward to Hector

SWITTERS
My Spanish is good but not that
good She says she wants me to
make love to her in the culo
What’s a culo

HECTOR
Her ass hole

SWITTERS spits out his drink

SWITTERS
Right Of course
(to the prostitute)
Sorry Maybe some other time

She walks off and Switters dabs himself dry

SWITTERS (CONT )
Too damn vivid South America

INT GRAND HOTEL BOLIVAR - EVENING

Switters walks through the lobby and approaches the front
desk

CLERK
Si senor

SWITTERS
It has just occurred to me to
inform your housekeeping staff
that I have a live parrot in my
room I don’t want anyone to be
alarmed

CLERK
Si senor

Switters walks towards the bar off to the left
SWITTERS

Oh and it might say some unusual
things

CLERK
Of course senor

Switters enters the bar

INT GRAND HOTEL BOLIVAR BAR - CONTINUOUS

Switters bellies up to the bar

BARTENDER
Good evening glass of pisco
SWITTERS
Please no
BARTENDER

Coffee

BRITISH VOICE
Not bloody likely

Switters looks down the bar and sees the only other person

there -- a heavyset British man REGINALD POTNEY SMITHE
SWITTERS
Potney
POTNEY

I thought it was you

SWITTERS
R Potney Smithe what brings
you to this microwave

POTNEY
Came to study some of the bloody
natives haven’t I

SWITTERS
Tenure time again at the diploma
factory

POTNEY

Afraid so Going to write up
some long-winded tripe about a
roving tribe of savages and
their habits and all that

SWITTERS
Ethnology The last refuge of the
scholar

POTNEY
Join me for a pisco For old
time’s sake Two old CRAFT
members to each other

SWITTERS
Don’t mind if I do

SWITTERS (VO)
CRAFT Club is a secret society
with branches in Hong Kong and
Bangkok whose members meet
periodically to drink a lot and
discuss Finnegans Wake When
asked about it later members
say “CRAFT” Can’t Remember A-

SWITTERS (CONT )
(holding up the glass)
Who would have thought that the
juice of a grape could be
transformed into a substance so
near napalm

They both drink

POTNEY
Here on Company business

SWITTERS
Partially

POTNEY

Just ran into your old colleague
Audubon Poe Are you all down
here on a convention or something

SWITTERS
Poe’s ex-pickle actually No we
go wherever we’re needed I’m off
to Iquitos tomorrow

POTNEY
Whatever for

SWITTERS
Humanitarian mission of sorts
Going to set an aging parrot free
in the jungle on behalf of an
aging relative

POTNEY
If you take it to Iquitos it
wont be free for long

SWITTERS
Why not

POTNEY
Despite its reputation as a
remote jungle town Iquitos is
about as urban and grim as
Liverpool Big parrot market
Your friend will only be captured
and put in another cage probably
brought back to the United States
No you want to go up to
Boquichicos hire a boat and go
up the river There’s a parrot
sanctuary up there

SWITTERS
Oh

POTNEY
I’m heading up that way myself
to study this bloody tribe
You’re welcome to come along

SWITTERS
Really Well thanks Actually
I don’t mind if I do
(raising his glass)
To a bon voyage

POTNEY
Let’s just hope there aren’t
too many insects

SWITTERS
Here here

EXT BOQUICHICOS - DAY

A small Amazonian jungle town Straw huts unpaved streets
and vacant lots Switters and Potney walk together -- Potney
in full British archaeological get up safari clothes and a
pith helmet Switters in his linen suit carrying the parrot
cage in one hand and his crocodile-skin valise in the other

Along the riverside are a few rickety boats Potney stops to
talk to INTI the Peruvian boat captain we saw earlier as
Switters amuses the locals with a video camera
POTNEY
(irate)
Que piensa soy UN TONTO

SWITTERS
What’s up

POTNEY
The blighter wants to charge us
twice what it should cost to take
us up river

SWITTERS
Think he knows we’re tourists

Switters walks around and sees the name printed on the side of
the boat -- LITTLE BLESSED VIRGIN OF THE STARRY WATERS

SWITTERS (CONT )
We’ll take it
(Potney and Inti look at him)
I like the name I have a special
feeling for the Virgin Please
have your men bring our bags I’11
carry this

He plops the cage down on deck

SAILOR BOY
PEOPLE OF ZEE WORLD RELAX

The locals jump back

SWITTERS
Some very good advice learned
from a very smart woman

(he puts his arm around Potney)
Pot old pal we’ve got a date
with a virgin even if she looks
like an old whore

EXT UCOYALI RIVER - DAY

The Blessed Virgin toots upstream Switters and Potney sit in
the stern with Inti who steers the motor-propelled boat while
smoking a cigarette wedged in the gap between his teeth
Sailor Boy’s cage swings from a hook and Switters puts the
video camera away in his valise

POTNEY
Are you a naturalist

SWITTERS
I’ve been called a lot of things
but no my benefactor wishes to
have a recording of the event
Can you imagine not trusting
your own grandson

POTNEY
In your case yes

SWITTERS
So tell me about this tribe

POTNEY
The Kandakanero They are the
most elusive tribe in all of
Amazonia There’s a rumor that
they were seen outside Boquichicos
and I’ve been trying to catalogue
as many of their socially
transmitted customs morals laws
and beliefs as possible before
they disappear completely
Actually I’m hoping to interview
their shaman a mystical leader
with a funny shaped-head and an
even funnier name Loosely
translated into English it means
End-of-Time To focus on a single
individual within the group is
unprecedented It will be a small
coup if I can interview this
extraordinary man

SWITTERS
And bolster your chances for
tenure

POTNEY
Lock ‘em in

SWITTERS

Sounds like pretty fulfilling work

POTNEY
Actually it is

Switters looks out at the muddy river flowing past and the
miles of thick jungle on either side

EXT UP THE UCOYALI RIVER - DAY

Deeper into the jungle now there is no sign of civilization
just the murky brown river the Little Virgin our travelers
and a parrot under wraps

Switters reaches into the bottom of his valise opening a
secret compartment which has a handgun a CD of “Broadway’s
Best Showtunes” and a photograph of his step-sister in a
cheerleader’s uniform He takes out the photo and admires it

POTNEY
Your girlfriend

SWITTERS
Not exactly

POTNEY
Uhm Switters old chap

SWITTERS
Yes

POTNEY

Don’t be overly alarmed but you
may want to look over your right
shoulder

Switters does and he sees a MASSIVE HAIRY SPIDER rearing up on
its hind legs atop of a bunch of bananas ready to strike

SWITTERS
AAAAAA

He jumps back and BLAM shoots the spider sending banana bits
splattering

Beat
Potney helps him up and the crew laughs

POTNEY
You alright man Overreacted a
bit I’d say

SWITTERS
Whoah Yes thank you Maybe I
should open up my own comedy club
in Boquichicos Call it
Arachnophobia
(bowing to the crew)
Anyone for fruit salad
Suddenly a pelting rain pours down on them

POTNEY
It’s alright Should last about
twenty minutes or so

SWITTERS
Too-damn-vivid South America

EXT JUNGLE - DAY

The sun is shining again on our band of merry travelers Now
they are on foot Inti cutting a trail through the jungle with
his machete Potney and crew bring up the rear parrot cage in
tow One of the natives records everything on the video
camera Switters sings “Come Fly With Me” his tune echoing
off the trees

SWITTERS
(singing)
“Come fly with me let’s
float down to Peruuuu
In Llama Land there’s a one
man band and he’1l toot
his flute for you
Come fly with me let’s take off
in the bluuuue”

He’s Fred Astaire-ing now dancing through the jungle

SWITTERS (CONT )
C’mon Potney you know Sammy Cahn
and Jimmy Van Heusen Think New
Jersey 1957

Potney ignores him shaking his head

SWITTERS
“It’s perfect for a flying
honeymoon they SAAAY
Come on fly with me let’s fly
Pack up let’s FLY AWAAAAY”

They come to a clearing Switters stops looking around at the
idyllic surroundings

SWITTERS
I think this is as good a place
as any

He waves forward the parrot cage removes the cover and holds
up Sailor Boy The videographer focuses his camera

SWITTERS (CONT )
Well Sailor Boy This is where
we part ways I hope you enjoy
your remaining days free as a
bird skipping across the rooftops
of the world In fact you’re
not Sailor Boy at all anymore
From here on out you’ve got no
name

He opens the door of the cage For a moment nothing happens
Sailor Boy looks around

SWITTERS (CONT)
Go on

Sailor Boy flutters and then darts out the cage flying up to
a nearby branch With one last look back he circles up towards
the top of the trees

BLAM

He’s shot down out of the sky

- -elanding on the jungle floor with a THUMP

SUDDENLY THE WOODS ARE FILLED WITH PAINTED NATIVE FACES THAT
HAVE STEPPED OUT FROM BEHIND EVERY TREE AND BUSH

POTNEY

The Kandakanero
SWITTERS

Shit For lack of a better word
POTNEY

No I think that just about sums

it up

EXT KANDAKANERO CAMPGROUND - DAY

Switters and Potney are surrounded by a circle of natives One
of them is their shaman END-OF-TIME who circles around them

SWITTERS
Seems friendly enough

End-of-Time bares his teeth All the natives point their
spears and guns Switters and Potney raise their hands

POTNEY
I forgot to mention something

FLASHBACK --
INT RUSSIAN PRESIDENTIAL RESIDENCE - EVENING

An elegant diplomatic function in the Presidential Palace Men
wear tuxedos and the women are bejeweled

Title card RUSSIAN PRESIDENT’S PRIVATE RESIDENCE MOSCOW
3 WEEKS EARLIER

INT RUSSIAN PRESIDENT’S BEDROOM - EVENING

Potney tip-toes into the President’s private chamber and sees
a small golden pyramid on the shelf

POTNEY (VO)

A mystical relic of the
Kandakanero taken by the
Russians during colonial times
The Tsars didn’t have much
success in Latin America but
they knew how to steal from
the ancients as well as anyone

Potney takes the pyramid and tucks it into his jacket
POTNEY (VO) (CONT)
I told the Kandakanero I’d get
it for them
BACK TO PRESENT --
EXT KANDAKANERO CAMPGROUND - DAY

Switters and Potney still have their hands up

POTNEY
Legend claims it restores sexual
potency

SWITTERS

I can see why they’d want it
back Okay so give ‘em the box

POTNEY
It’s a pyramid and I don’t have
it That’s why it was my good
fortune to run into you I
thought you could come along
and help me smooth things out
(MORE )
POTNEY (cont’d)
with End-of-Time here It’s the
kind of thing you people do
isn’t it

SWITTERS
Not exactly So where is it

POTNEY
I’m not at liberty to say

A shorter native whispers to End-of-Time translating
everything they’re saying

TRANSLATOR
Kayga garl huk hina sajra
rumishongo runo abajeno
Kandakanero tlyanapi sumaj
qullgikamaq

POTNEY
Do you have any idea how much
that little thing appears to
be worth I’ve stashed it away
somewhere safe where no man
can get at it

Now the translator speaks excitedly waving his arms and
pointing at them

SWITTERS
Potney you fool

End-of-Time takes off his headdress -- the top of his head is
shaped like a triangle

SWITTERS (CONT )
Look at his head It’s-

POTNEY
Extraordinary

SWITTERS
It looks like a triangle

POTNEY
Or a pyramid

End-of-Time walks up close to Switters’ face and puts his hand
on the back of his neck

END-OF-TIME
Piti kuna akapay qamkunap kanan

TRANSLATOR
I will curse you now

SWITTERS
Oh okay

A BLINDING WHITE FLASH KNOCKS SWITTERS OFF HIS FEET AND INTO
DREAMLAND

FADE TO WHITE

WITHIN THE WHITE LARGE SILVERY BULBS TAKE SHAPE CIRCLE EACH
OTHER AND THEN DISAPPEAR

EXT KANDAKANERO CAMPGROUND - EVENING

The campground is now deserted except for Switters and Potney

who wake up around a small fire Switters lies in a hammock
and Potney is on the ground They come to

SWITTERS
Whoah

POTNEY
Oh dear

SWITTERS
Did you see-

POTNEY

The bulbs Yes What do you think
they were

SWITTERS
I don’t know Where is everybody

POTNEY
They’ve undoubtedly moved on to
some other neck of the woods

SWITTERS
I’m getting a memory I think I
did something wrong

POTNEY
Oh yes that

SWITTERS

What was it

Potney motions to the camera on Switters’ chest who flips
opens the monitor and rewinds

IN THE VIDEO -- we see everyone sitting in a circle and
Switters with his eyes practically rolled up behind his head
He chews some food out of a broth A moment later he pulls a
colorful feather out of his mouth

SWITTERS (CONT )
Oh no Sailor Boy

POTNEY
Don’t suppose your grandmamma
will be too pleased

SWITTERS
Maestra please I’m in enough
trouble as it is What am I
going to do

POTNEY
Are you sure it was her bird

IN THE VIDEO -- we see Switters slowly pull a bird anklet out
of his mouth He turns it on the side “Sailor Boy”

Switters turns off the camera

POTNEY
Well as you Americans are fond
of saying “let’s get the fuck out
of here”

SWITTERS
My feelings exactly

He is about to put it on the ground WHEN HE STOPS

SWITTERS (CONT)
Hang on a sec There was something
else Do you remember something
about a curse

POTNEY
Poppycock

SWITTERS

Yes of course But what was it
Something about not touching the
ground Yes that’s it End-of-
Time said as I understood it
that if my feet ever touched the
ground again I would fall over
dead

Potney gets

POTNEY
The dirty bugger

SWITTERS
Yes I’m sure that’s it Was that
what you heard

up brushing himself off

POTNEY
Silly native superstition if you
ask me

SWITTERS
I’m glad you agree Wasn’t the same
cast upon you

POTNEY
No but my taboo was equally
ridiculous

SWITTERS
What was it

POTNEY
Load of bosh Totally off the
bean Same consequences as your
affliction but End-of-Time told
me

SWITTERS
Yes man what is it

POTNEY
That I would face death if I were
ever to touch another man’s willy

SWITTERS
Hah

POTNEY
Rubbish obviously

SWITTERS
And there’s no danger of you doing
that

POTNEY
Quite

SWITTERS
Not really fair is it

POTNEY
I don’t think fair has anything
to do with it Let’s get going
We should be able to pick up the
river back that way

Switters is about to hop out of the hammock but STOPS HIS FOOT
JUST BEFORE IT TOUCHES THE GROUND

SWITTERS
Just for the sake of argument is
this something you’d be willing to
put to the test I mean why should
it be on me

POTNEY
It’s silly We’re dealing here
with the primitive mind

SWITTERS
Of course But just for the sake
of sociological value isn’t it
something we should test For
the sake of the field

POTNEY
Absolutely not

SWITTERS
So you’re afraid to test it

POTNEY
Fear has nothing to do with it
It’s voodoo superstition with no
basis in fact

SWITTERS
Yes but as a scientist as an
ethnologist you must occasionally
have to undertake experiments in
the name of science that you may
find personally distasteful but
are necessary in order to study
the local culture In fact by
not testing it are you not being
negligent to your field

SWITTERS UNZIPS HIS FLY AND PULLS OUT HIS PECKER

SWITTERS (CONT)
And I for one don’t see why I
should be the one who has to test
(MORE )

SWITTERS (contd)
this out when you’re the one who
got us into this mess in the
first place

POTNEY
I’m a married man for God’s sake

SWITTERS
Easy big fella Listen it’s not
my cup of tea either But what
were testing here is your
professional dedication

POTNEY
Put that away

SWITTERS
This is larger than you or me I’m
testing your professionalism I’m
questioning your dedication to
your craft If you believe in
your life’s work if you believe
in the rigors of your field if
you are a true scientist then
you will touch my shmeckle

POTNEY
Not a chance

SWITTERS
Do it for your field Do it for
your Queen Your country No
better yet do it for yourself

POTNEY
No

SWITTERS
Just touch it man

POTNEY
No

SWITTERS
Are you a scientist

POTNEY
Yes

SWITTERS

Are you a man

POTNEY
Yes

SWITTERS
You’re the one who got us into this
now touch it

POTNEY
No

SWITTERS
Touch my shmeckle

POTNEY
If I do will your drop this
nonsense and we can leave this
God forsaken place

SWITTERS
Yes

POTNEY
Alright I’1ll do it

Potney gets down to all fours on the ground by the hammock
Switters swivels his hips

Potney reaches out

SWITTERS
Don’t grab it

POTNEY
I wasn’t going to

SWITTERS
Just touch it

POTNEY
Alright

SWITTERS
Just a poke

POTNEY

Alright

Potney holds out his index finger slowly heading towards
Switters’ pecker like God reaching out to Adam on the ceiling
of the Sistine Chapel

SWITTERS
Go on I don’t like this any
more than you do

Potney scrunches his face and makes the final move forward
Contact is made

- » AND POTNEY DROPS DEAD

Switters looks down at him stunned

SWITTERS (CONT )
Pot Potney

There is a rustling nearby and Inti busts through the trees
shocked by the scene

SWITTERS
It’s not what you think

Inti rushes over and kneels beside Potney

INTI
Muy muerto Muy muerto
(looking up at Switters)
This meester is very very dead

SWITTERS
(falling back in the hammock)
You better call your men You’re
going to have to carry me out of
here like a pig on a stick

EXT LANGLEY VA - DAY

A sign over the highway says “CIA NEXT RIGHT”

EXT CIA ENTRANCE - DAY

A security guard checks ID’s of the drivers lined up outside
the famous CIA Headquarters We hear the song “Someone To
Watch Over Me” over the next few scenes

SONG
There’s a little someone
I’m longing to see
I hope that he turns out to be
someone to watch over me

EXT CIA PARKING LOT - DAY

A car is parked at an off-angle in the handicapped parking
section by the front doors

INT CIA LOBBY - DAY

A long line of people wait to get into the main entrance They
seem impatient This isn’t a normal delay

Up ahead SWITTERS SITS IN A WHEELCHAIR wearing a blue blazer
and loafers with no socks trying to get through a turnstile
The guard looks impatient

SWITTERS
I’m stuck I can’t get through
INT OFFICE OF DEPUTY DIRECTOR CLANDESTINE OPERATIONS —- DAY
The nameplate on the desk says “MAYFLOWER CABOT FITZGERALD”

Behind the desk is the man facing our wheelchair-bound hero
Bobby Case sits in the corner spinning a bullet on the table

MAYFLOWER
Hector Sumac is missing

SWITTERS
Whom

MAYFLOWER

Hector Sumac you idiot The Agent
you recruited in Lima last week

SWITTERS
Oh Hector I’m sure he’1ll be
alright

MAYFLOWER

We don’t think he’1l be alright

at all In fact we think
something’s happened to him We
believe your intelligence has been
compromised

SWITTERS
That’s one way of putting it Three
years at Berkeley and nine hours of
modern poetry will do that to you
In fact our whole society-
MAYFLOWER
We’ve been tracking a Russian mole
in your section We believe Hector
was about to reveal the mole’s
identity when he disappeared We
believe it’s a kidnapping

SWITTERS
That’s terrible

BOBBY CASE
The mole could be anyone with
access to your movements Someone
you’ve known all your life
Someone you’ve never met

MAYFLOWER
As your Senior Case Officer
Bobby Case will be in charge

SWITTERS
Well it sounds like you’ve got
things under control As you can
see some personal issues have
come up So good luck

Switters moves but Mayflower opens a thick file on his desk

MAYFLOWER

I won’t deny that your record is
impressive You’ve been part of
dozens of successful clandestine
missions despite breaking every
rule in the book along the way
Mr Switters you are the most
commended highly complained
about officer in your section

SWITTERS
Switters Just Switters

Mayflower glares at him

SWITTERS (CONT )
Sorry sir Continue

MAYFLOWER
However over the course of the
past year your recruitment of new
agents is virtually nonexistent
almost all the information youve
gathered has been old or redundant
(MORE )

MAYFLOWER (contd)
And I have to ask myself why is a
smart guy like you producing so
little At this point my best
guess is that you’re the mole

SWITTERS
Me I’m not selling any secrets
I assure you that’s just your
run-of-the-mill professional
negligence Tell him Bobby

MAYFLOWER
Yes Bobby assures me you’re not
motivated enough to pull off
something like this

SWITTERS
Thank you Bobby Nice to know you
can count on your friends in times

of need

BOBBY CASE
Sorry pal We’ve got to vet
everyone

MAYFLOWER

(taking out a pen)
Tell us about Peru Did you engage
in any activity outside your
official duties worth noting Did
you interact with any suspicious
people or encounter anything
out of the ordinary

Switters leans back defensively
He crosses his legs

SWITTERS
No Not really

Mayflower reaches into his desk

MAYFLOWER
Operation molehunt is on Bobby
will fill you in on the details
In the meantime I want you to
stay in the country and absolutely
no contact with anyone about any
sensitive international information

SWITTERS
I can do that

MAYFLOWER
And there’s one more thing

Mayflower pulls out a green slip signing it

SWITTERS
Oh no please don’t I hate those
things I’m telling you the truth
I swear

Mayflower hands it to him
MAYFLOWER

Wed like you to take a polygraph
Just to be sure

SWITTERS
Look I should probably explain
my legs

MAYFLOWER

I just assume you fell down the
stairs at a whorehouse Are you
the one who parked in the
handicapped space

SWITTERS
Yes sir

MAYFLOWER
I had you towed

SWITTERS
Thank you

INT POLYGRAPH ROOM - DAY

A bare room with a modern desk in the center which is actually
a polygraph machine and computer The polygrapher is a touch
crazy Outwardly smiling while harboring the deepest
suspicions The face of happiness and the heart of darkness
CHRISTOPHER WALKEN perhaps

He stands over Switters putting nodes on Switters’ fingers
and wrapping coils around his chest

WALKEN
This machine will measure your
(MORE)
WALKEN (cont’d)
psychological reactions to my
questions When you’re lying it
will show up on my computer
printout here A man once
admitted to me quite without
prodding to killing his wife
chopping up her body and
discarding the pieces There
we go

He looks at Switters as if he’s his pride and joy and then
sits down behind his desk looking at the screen and smiles

SWITTERS
What is it

WALKEN
It says you’re lying already

SWITTERS
But I haven’t said anything

Walken ignores him and takes notes

WALKEN
Do you know me

SWITTERS
No I mean I just met you so yes
In a way

WALKEN
Do you intend to lie to me on
this test

SWITTERS
No

WALKEN
Have you ever engaged in deviant
sex

SWITTERS

Isn’t all sex kind of deviant
I mean isn’t that the point

WALKEN
Yes or no please TrueFalse
I have never thought about what
it would be like to be a member
of the opposite sex
Walken writes

SWITTERS
Hey you wrote before I answered

WALKEN
Sometimes you just know True
False I rarely like to harm
animals

Beat

SWITTERS
Is that a trick question

WALKEN
Who won the World Series last
year

SWITTERS
I don’t know The Advertisers

WALKEN
Are you an agent for the Russian
Intelligence service

SWITTERS
No

WALKEN
Where is Coney Island

SWITTERS
Wherever you want it to be

WALKEN
Have you ever had a snake bite
A friend of mine was bitten by
a snake in the Cambodian jungle
It was a terrible death
trembling with fever blinded by
the venom as it ravaged his
nervous system

He beams as if he’s just said something wonderful He studies
Switters’ face for a reaction

SWITTERS
Can I go now

INT LANGLEY HALLWAY - DAY
Switters wheels and Bobby Case walks down the corridor

BOBBY CASE
Sorry ‘bout all that kid
Mayflower’s got a stick up his
ass for procedure and I wanted
your name crossed off the list
So what the hell happened to you

SWITTERS
Had some trouble up the Amazon
I don’t know pal My heart’s
just not in it anymore

BOBBY CASE
Nonsense You’ve just hit a rough
patch we’ll snap you out of it

SWITTERS
No the wahoo’s dried up I’ve
got to get out of this mess and
I don’t even know where to begin

BOBBY CASE
Forget about it Let’s barbeque
have some burgers and beers Texas
style We need to pick up some buns

EXT SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - DAY

The supermarket is right at the edge of campus Switters and
Bobby Case walkwheel across the parking lot

BOBBY CASE
I like to shop here It’s a bit
out of the way but you get a
good look at the college tail
Imagine the possibilities

They approach an entrance where protestors shout and hold up
signs “CIA EVIL” “NO CIA RECRUITMENT ON CAMPUS” One of the
protestors shouts right into Bobby’s face

STUDENT
YOU PEOPLE ARE RUINING THIS
COUNTRY

Bobby gets behind Switters pointing down to garner sympathy
INT SUPERMARKET —- DAY

Bobby Case wheels Switters down the aisles throwing food onto
his lap as if he were a shopping cart

BOBBY CASE
Okay let’s take this one thing
at a time First order of business
is to get rid of this curse and
get you back on your feet

SWITTERS
That would probably entail getting
End-of-Time to lift the taboo

BOBBY CASE
Alright so let’s think about
that We’re both Company men
how would the boys at the pickle
factory approach this problem

SWITTERS
Probably pay someone off Or send
some goon to cut him down

BOBBY CASE
Okay that’s an idea I could fly
down to South America find this
End-of-Time guy and twist his arm
until he lifted the curse

SWITTERS
Always the way of the Cowboy
Bobby Meantime why don’t I track
down the pyramid and we’1ll offer
it back to him Shazam No curse

BOBBY CASE
Now you’re talking But what do
you think it all means Does the
curse have some symbolism at all
or is it just some jungle wiseguy
having fun with a city slicker

SWITTERS

I’ve been thinking about that
myself Do you remember the story
that monk told us in Rishikesh
He said that a great spiritual
master was once asked what it

was like to be Enlightened The
master answered “oh it’s just

(MORE)

SWITTERS (contd)
like ordinary life Except that
you’re two inches off the ground”

BOBBY CASE
Yeah

SWITTERS
Well look at me That seems to
be the exact predicament I’ve
found myself in

BOBBY CASE
Okay So

SWITTERS
So maybe End-of-Time was trying
to show me a glimpse of what
it’s like to be Enlightened

BOBBY CASE
That’s interesting Do you feel
Enlightened
SWITTERS
No
BOBBY CASE

Can you see if those are seeded
buns They get in my teeth

TWO VERY SUSPICIOUS MEN linger by the cottage cheese watching
our barbequers One of them has peculiar marks on his face

EXT BOBBY CASE’S HOME BACKYARD - DAY

From behind the bushes the two men watch Bobby Case grilling
Switters sits behind him

SWITTERS
You know I think Audubon Poe is
mixed up in all of this

BOBBY CASE
Poe That mercenary What would
make you think that

SWITTERS
It was something Potney said before
he bit the big one

BOBBY CASE
I thought you said he touched it

SWITTERS
Oh for Chrissake Bobby This is
serious No just before he ran
into me he said he saw Audubon Poe
Now what would Poe be doing in Peru

BOBBY CASE
Since he left the program Poe’s
long arm of nefariousness reaches
around the globe He was probably
involved in some drug deal or human
slave trafficking

SWITTERS
Still that’s quite a coincidence
I wouldn’t be surprised if Poe knew
a thing or two about this whole
business Do you know where I could
find him

BOBBY CASE
Last I heard he was running arms
out of Turkey If you want to talk
to him I could send out feelers

SWITTERS
Thanks

BOBBY CASE
Okay so weve got a plan You
find out from Poe where this
pyramid is and I’1ll pop down to
Peru and have a head-to-head with
this End-of-Time character

SWITTERS
Be careful it’s pointed Listen
there’s something else you can do
for me I just can’t bare to face
my dear Maestra with news of her
ill-fated parrot And I certainly
don’t want Suzy to see me in my
present state My age is already
an issue in our relationship
Could you reach out to them for me

BOBBY CASE
Say that you’re indefinitely
detained on some secret mission

SWITTERS
Exactly

BOBBY CASE
No worries We’ll get you out of
this yet Soon you’ll be singing
Accentuate the Positive at the
Days Inn in Okinawa up to your
knees in pussy and this whole
mess will be behind you

SWITTERS
I certainly hope so Meantime
what do we do about the Russians
in the hedges

BOBBY CASE
I saw them Are they Russian
Because I thought they might be
ours

SWITTERS
No definitely Russian It’s
this damn mole business You’re
not really taking it seriously
are you

BOBBY CASE
I’m taking it very seriously

SWITTERS
There’s no mole It’s a myth A
witch hunt of John Ashcroft
proportions

They both SPIT ON THE GROUND
BOBBY CASE
Maybe so But if I find out there
is amole
He mashes the burger into the grill and a flame flares up
SWITTERS
Looks like it’s a bad day to be

a mole Can I use your john

BOBBY CASE
Be my guest

Switters wheels off and Bobby Case waves to the Russians
behind the hedges
INT BOBBY CASE’S OFFICE - DAY

Switters wheels out of the bathroom High up on the bookshelf
a book is askew He stands on the footrests wheelchair
wobbling and takes it off the shelf -- “MY LIFE IN THE CIA BY
AUDUBON POE AMORALITY BETRAYAL AND IRRESPONSIBILITY IN
MODERN DIPLOMACY”

Switters turns it over -- a photo of the handsome suntanned
Poe is on the back cover Bobby Case enters the room and he
quickly puts the book back

SWITTERS
Just stretching out the old legs
Don’t want them to atrophy

He runs in place on the foot-rests the wheelchair pitching
back and forth Almost falling over he grabs the shelf for
balance

BOBBY CASE
Forget that look what just came
down the wire Hector Sumac’s dead

He brings up a CIA webpage on the computer -- scrolling down
they see a photo of a smiling Hector Sumac and the headline
“AGENT DEAD IN LIMA” Further down is a PHOTO OF SWITTERS

BOBBY CASE
Those idiots have put out the
all-points for you That makes you
an endangered species in these
parts You better skedaddle
because if the Russians know
you’re here our own goons can’t
be far behind

SWITTERS
What should I do

BOBBY CASE
I suggest you get the hell out
of here

SWITTERS
Can I borrow your car
EXT BOBBY CASE’S HOME —- DAY
The garage door slowly opens and Bobby Case’s car pulls out

turning down the suburban street Soon after a car parked
across the street follows

EXT BETHESDA STREET - DAY

Switters drives at a normal pace down the street the tail
following behind He turns onto a main road and speeds up a
bit The tail also speeds up

Driving down the main road a line of dark federal sedans
drive in the other direction After a few moments they U-turn
quickly and follow Switters and the Russians Switters speeds
up his tails gaining

EXT GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY

Switters turns past the supermarket and into the large gated
entrance to campus the Russians and Feds right on his tail

The cars drive down the main road much faster than the speed
limit and a CAMPUS SECURITY CAR joins the chase

Switters turns quickly around a bend SCREECHING the tires and
bouncing loudly over speed bumps disturbing the collegiate
calm of the place and sending co-eds scattering

Followed closely Switters drives his car right over the lawn
around the cloisters and towards a corner where two large
buildings meet

It’s a dead-end The protestors from the supermarket are
there lounging on the grass their signs on the ground They
look up at the cars bearing down on them and SCATTER IN PANIC

The car seems to pick out one of the students in particular --
the one who yelled at Bobby Case earlier -- corralling him one
way and then another until he’s backed into a corner

Before running him over Switters SLAMS ON THE BRAKES SENDING
MUD AND GRASS UP INTO THE STUDENTS FACE BEFORE STOPPING RIGHT
IN FRONT OF HIM

The Feds Russians and Campus police also stop behind the car
boxing it in

The drivers side door opens BUT INSTEAD OF SWITTERS STEPPING
OUT IT’S BOBBY CASE who looks the student square in the eye

BOBBY CASE
Punk bitch

EXT BOBBY CASE’S HOUSE - DAY

In the quiet peaceful suburbs a taxi pulls up to the curb
Switters wheels himself down the driveway and opens the back
door throwing his crocodile-skin valise onto the seat The
TAXI DRIVER gets out to help him into the cab

Sitting in the back seat with the breeze blowing through his
hair Switters flips through a royal flush of passports

An idyllic Mediterranean port town set around an ancient Roman
harbor Mopeds buzz past and tourists walk the streets A mid-
level hotel sits on a busy corner -- The Hotel Gil

INT HOTEL GUL LOBBY - DAY

Switters sits in the lobby on a round settee wearing a blue
pin-stripe suit doing the Le Monde crossword puzzle his legs
spread flat on the sofa We recognize the two Russians in the
corner with their eyes on Switters

AUDUBON POE enters the hotel and sits next to Switters He is
an ex-James Bond type not the debonair charming Roger Moore
but the mean badass Daniel Craig kind A hardened veteran of
many clandestine missions

POE
Your mama’s so fat she sat ona

the guy who knows seventy-five
words for a woman’s vagina

SWITTERS
Seventy-one I wonder if that
will be my claim to fame The
lone talent people will remember
me by

POE
The only reason I’m here is
because Bobby Case put in a good
word for you What do you want

SWITTERS
I have some questions

POE
Not here Let’s walk

He gets up expecting Switters to follow When he doesn’t Poe
turns back Switters is climbing into his wheelchair

SWITTERS
Minor mishap in South America

EXT ANTALYA STREETS - DAY

Poe walks and Switters wheels down the streets bustling with
tourists and gift shops The Russians follow a block behind

POE
So I assume the tail’s for you

SWITTERS
Yes I should tell you that
Langley seems to think I might be
some kind of mole

POE
They’ve been talking about this
bullshit Russian mole for years
I looked into it and there is no
mole It’s an old wives tale
Poe stops

SWITTERS
My thoughts exactly Wanna buy
some ice cream cones to prevent
any lip reading

POE
It doesn’t matter

SWITTERS
But aren’t you on CIA’s hit list

POE
I put that rumor out myself
Figured if I made a public
enough fuss they wouldn’t dare
touch me at least not in any
obvious violent way

SWITTERS
That’s good Nice play Do you
want to get ice cream anyway

POE
What do you want

SWITTERS
Know anything about a stolen
Peruvian pyramid

POE
Sorry I can’t help you

He turns and walks away

SWITTERS
What were you doing in Lima

POE
Contracting sexually transmitted
diseases

SWITTERS
What did you talk to Potney about

POE
None of your business

SWITTERS
He’s dead you know

Poe stops This rattles him

POE
How

SWITTERS
Wandering fingers

Poe looks back at the Russians who pretend to be window
shopping HE GRABS SWITTERS BY THE WHEELCHAIR SPINS HIM
AROUND AND HOPS ON KICKING THEM FORWARD LIKE A SKATEBOARD

SWITTERS (CONT )
Wait a minute

They sail down the street at increasing speed The Russians
give chase but are slowed by tourists on the sidewalk

Switters and Poe jump off the curb and onto the road weaving
through the cross-section of traffic Poe alters directions by
leaning left and right as they duck traffic

Switters mostly screams

They pick up speed as they roll further downhill towards the
marina At the end of the road a truck pulls out in front of
them blocking the road

SWITTERS (CONT )
OH SHIT

He reaches for the wheel but Poe grabs his hand

POE
You’1ll burn yourself

Instead he takes Switters’ tie and uses it as a buffer to grab
the wheel and turn them sharply to the right bouncing off the
truck and right towards a corner café

Poe jumps off the wheelchair and runs ahead sitting at a
table and pulling the other chair away with one hand Switters
glides right into the space and stops

Poe grabs two used coffee cups off another table and puts them
down Switters and Poe look like two ordinary café patrons

SWITTERS
You’re good

The Russians run down the hill and right past the café
POE

They’1l double back in a minute
Let’s go

He gets up and wheels Switters down a long alleyway that ends
at the edge of the water A dead end

SWITTERS
The end of the line

POE
Or the beginning

Poe points out to the marina where a gleaming 90-foot yacht is
anchored offshore -- “THE BANALITY OF EVIL”

EXT BANALITY OF EVIL DECK - DAY

Poe and Switters are on deck Poe flips open the lid of the
aft hold and jumps down into the storage area which has a
small cooler surrounded by boxes of land-mines gas-masks
machine guns rocket launchers and grenades

SWITTERS
Quite a collection

Poe tosses up a bottle of champagne to Switters who snatches
it out of the air

EXT BANALITY OF EVIL DECK - DAY

Poe sits on deck eating grapes and drinking champagne which
he pours for Switters

POE
Potney did some occasional work
for me He was mostly incompetent
but his knowledge of language and
certain Arab tribes was useful to
my operations He was always
trying to sell me some relic he
pilfered from some museum or
government I never took him
seriously and besides stealing
from governments is bad for
business But this time he said
he had something special I was
down in South America anyway so
I agreed to meet him listened to
his pyramid scheme said “no
thank you” and was on my way

SWITTERS
Did he show you the pyramid
POE
Didn’t have it with him Said he
hid it somewhere safe

SWITTERS
Yes he said that to me too
Something about hiding it
somewhere no man could get at it
What was the last thing he did
for you

POE
Come this way

EXT BANALITY OF EVIL STARBOARD DECK- DAY
Poe and Switters look out at the rocky shore

POE
The Kurdish people are the largest
ethnic minority in the world
without a home They’ve endured
persecution by any number of
countries for centuries The
Syrian Kurds are particularly
oppressed and have been working
up to armed conflict for years
Armed conflict you understand
is good for business

He points to a spot ashore

POE (CONT )
Hatay Turkey On the Syrian
border Site of Alexanders
victory over the Persians and
supposedly the beach where Jonah
was spit out by the whale

SWITTERS
If you believe in that kind of
thing
POE
What
SWITTERS

Nothing sorry Continue

POE
The Nomads carry my guns over
(MORE )
POE (contd)
those hills and across the border
into Syria Potney spoke most of
the tribal languages of the region
so he would go along and make sure
the arms got to the buyers That
was his route

SWITTERS
When was his last run

POE
A few weeks ago Just before Peru
I’ve got a new shipment going out
and no one to deliver it What do

you think

SWITTERS
I think my answer lies along
that route

The sun sets on the deck of the lolling ship and our merry

well in the world

EXT HATAY HARBOR - EVENING

Surrounded by crates of arms Poe rows a rubber boat towards
shore Switters sits across from him his wheelchair folded
behind

POE
So tell me some words for vagina

SWITTERS
Well personally I prefer Swedish
“slida Very onomatopoeic

POE
Yes It has a ring

SWITTERS
Or the Japanese “chitsu” In
Hebrew it’s “cus” so be careful
your pronunciation when you order
couscous in Jerusalem But you’ll
never catch me using the Welsh

POE
What’s that

SWITTERS
“Llawes goch

POE
What’s it in Turkish

SWITTERS

EXT HATAY BEACH - EVENING

Switters Poe and a TRIBE OF BEDOUIN NOMADS are on a deserted
beach on a small cove The lights of the Banality of Evil glow
offshore The arms are loaded up on camels and the empty
crates put back on Poe’s rowboat

POE
You’re on your own from here

SWITTERS
Thanks Poe I’1ll be sure to
remember you in my memoirs

POE
Please don’t

SWITTERS
Any advice on how to ingratiate
myself with these fine desert men

POE
Tell them a story And keep your
gun handy

With the help of the Nomads Poe shoves off and rows back
towards the ship

SWITTERS
Oh I remember the Turkish
(cupping his hands)
“DOLYOLU “DOLYOLU

He turns around and looks at the men a tough rugged lot who
stare at him Switters realizes his mistake (he has just
shouted “vagina” to a man in a language they probably
understand) He smiles A Nomad has a monkey on his shoulder

SWITTERS (CONT )
Hello Your monkey reminds me of
the time when once in Burma my
(MORE )

SWITTERS (contd)
friend Bobby Case and I were
strip-searched at a roadblock
Rubber gloves were unavailable
there you see and the
militiamen understandably not
wanting to foul their fingers
had a pet monkey they’d trained
to do the job for them He was a
smart little fellow-

NOMAD
We must go now stop your talking

SWITTERS
Okay

EXT TURKISH DESERT - DAY

Under a brutal sun the caravan moves single file across the
mountain ridge Switters sits on a camel wheelchair strapped
to the back fishing through his valise and pulls out a gun

SWITTERS
Hello Mister Glock

IT SLIPS OUT OF HIS HAND BOUNCES OFF THE CAMEL AND FALLS TO
THE GROUND The Nomads laugh -- one of them picks up the gun
and tucks it into his tunic

SWITTERS (CONT)
Okay
(loudly so everyone can hear)
MY GIFT TO YOU

Switters takes out his satellite phone and is more careful
with it as he dials a number and listens to it ring Maestra
answers CROSS CUT BETWEEN HER HOME AND HIS CAMEL --

MAESTRA
This better be good

SWITTERS
Maestra my dear how are you
It’s Switters your adoring
wandering grandson

MAESTRA
What do you want

SWITTERS
Just checking in Wanted to see
how things are in your neck of
the universe Or perhaps I’m
just feeling a bit homesick

MAESTRA
What have you done with my
parrot you indignant relation
And think very carefully before
you answer Your life may depend
on it

SWITTERS
Sailor Boy Oh yes I forgot to
tell you that I released him I
have the video just editing it
down a bit

MAESTRA
Where did you release him

SWITTERS
Just where we had planned in the
Peruvian Amazon After a moment’s
hesitation he burst from his cage
and with one final look back flew
up into the great jungle beyond

MAESTRA
Really

SWITTERS
Cross my heart He’s probably
kamikaze mating with some parakeet
half his age right now

MAESTRA
Hmmm

SWITTERS
Cheer up You are beginning to
sound like a camel Are you aware
that a camel’s hump is just a
load of fat

MAESTRA
Then it’s the same as a woman’s
breast

SWITTERS

Oh no dear Maestra a woman’s
(MORE )
She sighs

SWITTERS (contd)
breast is a miniature moon It’s
made out of moon paste and warm
snow and honey

MAESTRA
You romantic fool

SWITTERS
How’s Suzy

MAESTRA

I believe our young Suzy has
acquired a boyfriend

SWITTERS
No

MAESTRA
She’s been attracting the
attention from boys for some time
which I’m sure is no news flash
to you but since your absence she
seems to have released many of
her inhibitions

SWITTERS
Why are you torturing me

MAESTRA
It’s time Switters to renounce
your adolescent fixations Don’t
worry her purity is still intact
Truthfully she finds all this
attention distracting from her
studies I dare say there will
come a time when she will long
for that attention

SWITTERS
Maestra you are a nymph of the
sea and stars And you will
always be the most desirable woman
in Seattle’s Magnolia District

MAESTRA
I’m not a lobster so stop trying
to butter me up I want to see
that videotape Why do you always
have a way of making me feel like
your lying

SWITTERS
Professional courtesy I will get
you a copy of that entrancing video
just as soon as I find a post
office I must go now You are in
my thoughts

MAESTRA
Where are you going

Switters thinks for a moment looking off into the barren
pancake desert beyond the mountains

SWITTERS
To the opera

EXT DESERT OASIS - EVENING

The Nomads set up camp for the night along a small pond and
build sandpit fires Switters watches the men help each other
brush down their loads gather twigs for the fire set up
tents and prepare the food One of the Nomads brings Switters
some food on a plate

SWITTERS
You are all family

NOMAD
Yes That is my father these are
my brothers and cousins and those
who have married into my family

SWITTERS
Quite a set-up you have here

NOMAD
We are a happy people
(making a fist)
And we are together

SWITTERS
I can see that Tell me there was
another man who traveled with you
from time-to-time Heavyset
British chap Did you ever see him
carrying a pyramid about yay big

NOMAD
No He was like you but different

SWITTERS
How
NOMAD
I cannot say Only that the others
the rest of my family think you
are very strange

SWITTERS
They may not be wrong

NOMAD
What is life for you in America
Why are you different than other
men from your place

SWITTERS
Well most American men secretly
hate women and love golf I love
women and hate golf

NOMAD
What is gawwf
SWITTERS
Exactly
NOMAD

What brings you to the desert
What do you seek

SWITTERS
I’m just trying to stay out of
trouble

The Nomad studies his face for a moment and then laughs
NOMAD
I like you I like you strange
American
EXT SYRIAN DESERT - DAY
Deeper into the desert our caravan trudges onwards Switters

drips the last drops of water into his mouth and takes out his
cellphone typing a text

HE TYPES -- “BOYFRIEND”
RESPONSE -- “FB”
SWITTERS
FB FB Fuck Buddy No

BEEP more texts come in and he reads them aloud
SWITTERS (CONT )
“Just joking”
(BEEP)
“LMAO Laughing My Ass Off”
(BEEP )
“Rolling On The Floor Laughing”

Switters sighs typing a response

SWITTERS (CONT )
Please Retain Your Virginity PRYV

The Nomad comes up beside him

NOMAD
Hello American I have spoken to
my father the Khan and he offers
you to stay with us

SWITTERS
(pocketing the phone)
Thanks but I’ve got a mortgage
back in Seattle

NOMAD
My father the Khan offers you one
of his daughters

He motions to four veiled women riding camel-back behind them
They blush and giggle

SWITTERS
That is a very flattering offer
Tell your father they are very
beautiful

NOMAD
Yes they are

SWITTERS
But I have to say no

NOMAD
Is this Moogage woman your wife

SWITTERS
You could say that Thirty-year
fixed-rate ‘Til death do us part

NOMAD
She will not be happy with you

SWITTERS
No Besides I don’t think your
sisters will understand my sense
of humor Every bon mot every
wise crack will fall on deaf ears
I couldn’t live under that
particular tent

The Nomad laughs
NOMAD
You are right American They are

not very funny at all

They pass a large walled-in compound From within we hear
SOUNDS OF WOMEN’S LAUGHTER Switters looks over

NOMAD (CONT )
Oh no American This is a place
where no man can enter

SWITTERS
What did you just say

NOMAD

In this place only women inside
No man can enter

SWITTERS
I’1l1 be damned

Switters stops his camel
SWITTERS (CONT )

No man can enter a nunnery

Potney you son of a bitch
EXT OUTSIDE CONVENT - DAY
Switters wheels himself up to the large wooden gate which
blocks the entrance to the walled compound There is a large
bell and bellrope with a sign in Arabic French and English

“TRADESMEN RING THREE TIMES
THOSE IN NEED RING TWICE
THE GODLESS SHOULD NOT RING AT ALL”

Switters RINGS ONCE
The laughter stops

Switters RINGS FOUR TIMES

No answer He looks around -- he is alone and there is
absolutely nothing for miles in either direction

He backs up and propels himself forward SLAMMING INTO THE
DOOR Nothing He backs up and SLAMS INTO IT AGAIN pounding
on the door with his fists

Very high up on the door a peephole slides open

WOMAN
Qu’est-ce que vous cherchez

SWITTERS
What am I looking for The
International House of Pancakes
must have taken the wrong exit

The peephole closes and Switters hears a commotion behind the
door The peephole opens again and this time another set of
eyes appear this one belonging to an IRISH WOMAN

IRISH WOMAN
What’s your business here

SWITTERS
I don’t have any business I was
just in the neighborhood and
thought I’d drop by May I come in

IRISH WOMAN
Dreadfully sorry but we can’t let
you in at the moment Masked
Beauty has said not to let anyone
in under any circumstances

SWITTERS
Masked Beauty Are you pirates

IRISH WOMAN
You’re not from the Church

SWITTERS
Hardly Not my end of the field
What’s your name little darling

IRISH WOMAN
(biting her lip)
Sorry sir but you’ll have to go
away

She slams the peephole closed
SWITTERS
No wait It’s hot as hell out
here How about a little
sustenance Not very charitable
for Church people if you ask me

He wheels himself over the stony ground to the minimal shade
of a cypress tree his back to the compound

AN ORANGE COMES FLYING OVER THE WALL LANDING NEXT TO HIM
Beat

SWITTERS (CONT)
Thank you

ANOTHER COMES OVER HITTING HIM IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD

EXT OUTSIDE CONVENT - DAY

The sun beats down on Switters -- it’s brutal heat-stroking
weather Orange peels are on the ground around him and his
lips are parched Even when his eyelids are closed he cannot
block out the bright sun

He opens them to see a BEAUTIFUL NUN (mid-forties) looking
down at him with stunning eyes

SWITTERS
I love you

NUN
(with a slight French accent)
You are out of your cotton-pickin’
mind

He closes his eyes again

INT CONVENT BEDROOM - DAY

Switters wakes up The beautiful nun is squeezing water from a
rag into a basin Her name is DOMINO

DOMINO
Youre awake The fever seems to
be going down

SWITTERS
Thanks to you I’m sure

She sits on the bed next to him placing the wet rag on his
forehead He studies her face

She stops

DOMINO
You must thank God not me

SWITTERS

Don’t you find it a bit batty
that people believe God the
epitome of enlightenment could
be so puffed up with human
vanity that he’d expect us to
sing his praises at every
opportunity and twice on Sunday

DOMINO
Have you traveled by wheelchair
through the Syrian desert in
order to debate theology Mister-

SWITTERS
Just Switters Do you get a lot
of visitors Do you have any kind
of relics here Preferably
triangular in shape

DOMINO
Why did you come here

SWITTERS
I’m just a curious traveler
wandering down the camel path
of life I didn’t catch your
name

DOMINO
Around here I’m called Domino Or
just Sister

SWITTERS
And you’re American But spent
some time in France Paris Id
say

DOMINO
I was raised in Philadelphia and
lived in Paris for a while We
must get you better so you can
move on your way The supply truck
comes every two weeks You can get
(MORE )

DOMINO (contd)
a ride back to Damascus or
whatever your final destination

SWITTERS
I have to tell you I’m surprised
someone from the City of Brotherly
Love could be so inhospitable
It’s a cruel wasteland out there

DOMINO
Don’t take it personally or doubt
our Christian charities The
Pachomian Order is an Eden here
in the desert But it’s an Eden
for Eves only I’m afraid

SWITTERS
An Adamless Eden I’11 have to
mull that one over What about a

serpent

DOMINO
No No serpent here either I’m
afraid

Switters touches her forearm

SWITTERS
But every Paradise has a serpent

DOMINO
Not this one

INT CONVENT BEDROOM - DAY

Switters lies in bed The door opens and Domino enters
bringing him a bowl of soup

DOMINO
You seem to be on the mend I’m
afraid it’s not much but Italian
night isn’t until next week

She sits down next to him with the soup and spoon-feeds
SWITTERS

I’m sorry if I’m any kind of a
burden

him

DOMINO
Well you must be attended to and
nobody else here speaks English
except for Fannie our Irish lass
and I wouldn’t trust her alone
with you

SWITTERS
Is it her you don’t trust or me

DOMINO
Neither of you frankly

SWITTERS
How many nuns are in your Order

DOMINO
Nine of us in total including
the Mother Superior my aunt
Masked Beauty We are an unusual
Order We believe in free will
and common sense and compassion
We’re allowed to rename ourselves
not after women we were taught to
admire but our dream names the
ones we never told anyone

SWITTERS
Hence Domino and Masked Beauty

DOMINO
Yes and Mustang Sally Fannie
who spoke to you at the gate
Pippi ZuZu and Bob

SWITTERS
Bob

DOMINO
You’ll have to ask her What about
your faith Mr Switters What do
you believe in

SWITTERS
Uhm well I try not to

DOMINO
Ooh-la-la You don’t believe in
anything

SWITTERS
My faith is whatever makes me feel
good about being alive

DOMINO
Then you are alone
SWITTERS
You bet your sweet tootsies I am
DOMINO
You’re out of your cotton-pickin’
mind
SWITTERS

I hate to tell you but as charming
as I find your attempt to be a
hip-American nobody says cotton-
pickin’ anymore

DOMINO
Well I do And that means somebody
still says it

She drops the spoon in the soup gets up and leaves slamming
the door behind her Switters lies back in bed and hits his
head with his hand

SWITTERS
Switters you idiot

INT CONVENT BEDROOM - DAY

Switters naked is propped up on his knees on the wheelchair
looking out the window at the courtyard below where nuns go
about their duties He watches them closely sweeping and
feeding the chickens as he talks on his phone with Bobby Case

SWITTERS
The pyramid is here somewhere I
know it Now I just need to find
it

BOBBY CASE
Hilarious Holed up with nine
nuns in the Syrian desert
Imagine the possibilities

SWITTERS
I’m glad you find the situation
amusing How’s the head-hunting

BOBBY CASE
I’ve been up and down this damned
river in my low-flying twin-engine
(MORE)

BOBBY CASE (contd)
Cessna thirty times and no one has
seen this tribe They seem to have
just vanished

EXT MAESTRA’S SEATTLE HOME - DAY

Instead of flying a twin-engine Cessna down the Peruvian
Amazon Bobby Case is instead lurking in the bushes outside
Maestra’s home He approaches a window and opens it from the
outside while talking to Switters on his cellphone

SWITTERS
Funny it sounds awfully quiet
for a Cessna

BOBBY CASE
Noise cancellation headphones
I’ll get you a pair

He climbs through the window into Switters’ bedroom and begins
looking through his things -- bookshelf desk and drawers

BOBBY CASE (CONT )
Don’t you worry Ill find
this End-of-Time character and
when I do Ill give him a little
taste of American justice

SWITTERS
Just be sure he lifts the curse
before you do anything rash

INT HALLWAY —- DAY

Bobby Case sneaks down the hallway with Switters’ laptop under
his arm He stops at an open door Through the crack he sees a
female leg shaving in the bath He stops and leers

SWITTERS
There’s another thing There’s a
nun here She’s really I don’t
know kind of intriguing I feel
like a school-kid talking like
this

The bathroom door swings open and Bobby is exposed with
Switters laptop under his arm
INT CONVENT BEDROOM - DAY
Switters hears a female SCREAM

SWITTERS (CONT)
Bobby Bobby

The door opens and Fannie walks in with Switters’ food She
sees his naked butt and SCREAMS dropping the tray He hangs
up the phone and twists around covering himself up Fannie
hides her eyes trying to pick up the food

SWITTERS
Sorry Could you please hand me
my clothes

EXT CONVENT GARDEN - DAY

Switters now fully dressed and in his wheelchair wheels up
to Domino who is planting vegetables in the garden

SWITTERS
I would like to apologize if I
offended you in any way

DOMINO
That’s alright

He holds the bag of seeds out for her

DOMINO (CONT )
I hear you gave Fannie quite a
scare

SWITTERS
Yes I’m afraid I may have
shocked her

DOMINO
I doubt it She wants to fuck
your brains out

Switters drops the bag and tries to put the seeds back inside

DOMINO (CONT )
Do they not still use that
expression in Philadelphia
anymore

SWITTERS
Just caught me off guard a bit
(MORE )

SWITTERS (contd)
that’s all I didn’t expect well
a nun to use that expression

DOMINO
And well you shouldn’t I don’t
even like to think about it but
we don’t encourage our Sisters to
repress any of their desires She
likes you She’s young and
attractive and while you’re
waiting for the convoy to arrive
you should know that you are both
free to do whatever you like

SWITTERS
Well I don’t like thank you very
much

DOMINO

Don’t you find her appealing

SWITTERS
She’s not so bad But I guess
I thought maybe you and I-

DOMINO
Ooh-la-la No no That’s
ridiculous
SWITTERS
Why don’t you find me appealing
DOMINO
You’re not so bad But you’re not
my type
SWITTERS
How do you know
DOMINO

You haven’t found maturity yet
You are not at peace

SWITTERS
Well I’m working on it Damn
you sure know how to break a
guy’s heart

DOMINO
The pain of love does not break
hearts it merely seasons them
(MORE )
DOMINO (contd)
We here at the Order have always
worked to build strong spirits
Spirits that cannot be broken
You will be here for a few days
why don’t you try and make the
most of rebuilding yours

SWITTERS
With your help

DOMINO
I believe that through prayer
Christian ritual and good old-
fashioned elbow-grease even the
most brazen heathen can find
peace

SWITTERS
So you think I have a chance

She looks at him askew

SWITTERS (CONT)
Why don’t we start with a stroll
around the grounds I wish to know
every nook and cranny of this place

EXT CONVENT COURTYARD —- DAY

Domino pushes Switters around the compound On the ground
next to the gate is a pair of long wooden poles

SWITTERS
What are those

DOMINO
Those Uhm in French they’re
called les 6échasses I can’t
remember the English The gates
were made too tall so the nuns
use them to look through the
peephole

SWITTERS
Stilts Of course Why didn’t I
think of that Can I try them
out

DOMINO
What exactly is your malady
Mr Switters

EXT CONVENT COURTYARD - LATER

Switters tries walking on huge 10-foot tall stilts He hobbles
back and forth almost falling Domino can’t help but laugh as
she stands under him making sure he doesn’t fall

Switters is getting the hang of it He takes a few steps
forward looks up AND SEES FANNIE IN HER SECOND STORY BEDROOM

SHE’S HOLDING THE PYRAMID WHICH SHE WRAPS IN A PACKAGE AND
PUTS IN HER DRESSER DRAWER

Switters gapes trying to hold still

Fannie looks out the window and sees him -- they are at eye
level to each other

SHE SCREAMS

Switters loses his balance and falls backwards landing right
on top of Domino They are face-to-face laughing

SWITTERS
Nice catch

DOMINO
We couldn’t let your feet touch
the ground

SWITTERS

So you believe in the curse

DOMINO
No but you do And if you
believe in something other than
what’s right in front of you
then that’s a kind of a faith
What’s the expression Whatever
floats your boat

Switters shifts wincing He has an erection

DOMINO (CONT )
What’s that

SWITTERS
Nothing

DOMINO
I can feel that

SWITTERS
My boat

EXT OUTSIDE CONVENT GATE - DAY

A large package sits outside the gate The gate opens slightly
and the package is dragged inside

EXT CONVENT COURTYARD —- DAY

Switters rips open the box Inside is a note on CIA
stationary “Merry X-mass from your buddy Santa Case”

SWITTERS
A jetpack
(inside he sees a SEGWAY)
Cool

INT CONVENT DINING HALL - EVENING

Italian Night Switters and the nine nuns sit around two long
wooden tables lit with candles and covered in red-and-white
checkered tablecloths Light Italian music plays on an old CD
player in the corner

Switters glares at Fannie who turns away Domino watches the
exchange

SWITTERS
God is a fixed point eternal and
absolute right It’s the way we
view God that changes over history
Sometimes he’s personal other
times aloof baritone and vengeful
So for me the key is not to get
stuck on one idea To have a certain
flexibility More wine

He offers the wine to an elderly nun next to him (MASKED
BEAUTY wearing a veil covering her face) who declines but
Switters helps himself to a healthy pour

SWITTERS (CONT )
This really is terrific wine
Did you make it with your feet

MASKED BEAUTY
Domino was right You are a fool
But you’re an interesting fool

SWITTERS
Thank you So why are you called
Masked Beauty

MASKED BEAUTY
Well Mister Switters I was once
considered the most beautiful
woman in Paris Everywhere I went
men stared at me My beauty was
becoming a distraction So I
prayed to the Almighty until I was
granted an end to my suffering

She pulls away her veil to reveal a woman who in her
advanced age retains much of her beauty except for a GIANT
MOLE ON THE TIP OF HER NOSE

SWITTERS
Whoah That’s one powerful prayer

MASKED BEAUTY
It’s a gift from God

SWITTERS
Are you sure about that

MASKED BEAUTY
The more I prayed the larger the
mole became

SWITTERS
Think you might’ve gone too far

She smiles and replaces her veil

SWITTERS (CONT )
What’s a mole like you doing in
a place like this Well I’d like
to make a toast

He pours another healthy glass Domino looks horrified

SWITTERS (CONT)
I’ve spent the greater part of
my adult life in the company of
men Rebels dreamers soldiers-
of-fortune out-of-work
mercenaries and vagabond scholars
But tonight Italian night I
salute you nuns who give your
hearts to a man from a distant
time and place whom they love
beyond everything else It’s
the nun who lives most purely
and with the least self-serving
compromise To all nuns The most
romantic people on earth

A weak smattering of applause Switters downs his drink

SWITTERS (CONT )
Now I’d like to talk about James
Joyce

INT CONVENT DINING HALL - EVENING

Only three nuns are left Broadway showtunes play from
Switters’ CD and Fannie and another nun (Pippi) dance together
in the middle of the Switters and Domino sit at separate
tables watching them dance

DOMINO
Are you drunk

SWITTERS
Sobriety for some people is a
thin and temporary disguise No
I am not Just a little So Fanny
must be the one who has contact
with the outside

DOMINO
Yes She’s the most comfortable
interacting with laymen so she
goes to town for our little
errands between supply trucks
Why do you ask

SWITTERS
No reason

DOMINO
Would you believe that I haven’t
danced since my Junior Prom in
Philadelphia

SWITTERS
You’re kidding Would you like
to dance

DOMINO
What about your curse

SWITTERS
If you’1ll bring your table
together with mine I think we can
give it a whirl
They bring their tables together and he leaps up extending a
hand out to her She takes it and they dance to the song
“STRANGER IN PARADISE”

MUSIC
Take my haaaand
I’m a stranger in paradise
All lost in a wonderland
a stranger in paradise
If I stand starry-eyed
that’s the danger of paradise
for mortals who stand beside
an angel like you

At first she keeps her distance but Switters whirls her around
and dips her a bit and she relaxes into his embrace

DOMINO
Thank you

SWITTERS
It’s my birthday tonight

DOMINO
What

SWITTERS
Funny I remembered usually I
forget

DOMINO
Are you serious

SWITTERS
Yes

DOMINO

You’re not pulling my leg

SWITTERS
No it really is my birthday

DOMINO
Don’t you celebrate it

SWITTERS
Not in a long time When’s yours

DOMINO
It was back in July

SWITTERS
And how did you celebrate

DOMINO
We had Italian night

They smile

DOMINO (CONT )
But then around midnight I got up
and went out into the desert to
try and count the stars
Astronomers claim the human eye
can see no more than five
thousand stars at one time but I
swear I counted twenty thousand
It was a splendid celebration

SWITTERS
I should have like to have done
that for my birthday counting
stars Maybe next year

She stops
DOMINO
Meet me at the front gate at ten-
thirty
SWITTERS

I’m free Just have one thing
to do first

INT FANNIE’S BEDROOM ROOM - EVENING

Switters sneaks into the room on his Segway He has trouble
maneuvering -- banging into things and getting stuck in the
corner

The room is a barren space with only a bed a dresser with a
cross nailed to the wall over it He glides over to the
dresser and opens up the drawer -- no package He opens
another drawer -- it’s filled with sexy underwear He holds up
a particularly lacey pair

SWITTERS
As Bobby Case would say imagine
the possibilities

FANNIE
Can I help you

He spins around to see Fannie standing in the doorway

SWITTERS
Uhm I was just looking for
a good time

She approaches him with lust in her eyes He backs up the
Segway humming to life

SWITTERS (CONT )
Although in my fragile state
that might not be such a good
idea

FANNIE
I want to-

SWITTERS
I know I’ve heard Word travels
fast around here

She moves on him and he backs up maneuvering the Segway
towards the door But she blocks it

SWITTERS
Please I don’t want to hurt you

FANNIE
But I want you to

SWITTERS
Please you’re a nun Okay wait
Turn around and I’11 take off
your habit

She does but instead of undressing her he pinches the back of
her neck making her collapse on the ground

SWITTERS (CONT)
Sorry But I’ve already got a date

EXT TOWER - DAY

The Segway rests at the bottom of the ladder On the roof of
the tower is the incredible layout Domino has prepared --
Persian carpets and silk pillows under a star-filled sky
Switters and Domino lie on their backs looking up at the truly
breathtaking stars

DOMINO
How many have you counted

SWITTERS
Four My mind keeps wandering
DOMINO
I love the desert It’s the place
I feel closest to my breath and
the breath of God Although I do
miss Christmas in Paris

SWITTERS
I love Paris in the Springtime
When it sizzles Thank you for my
birthday gift It may be the best
anyone has ever given me

DOMINO
Oh but this is not your gift

SWITTERS
No You mean there’s more

She rolls over on her stomach so they are face-to-face
hides her face in her hand

She takes a

DOMINO
I am so embarrassed

SWITTERS
What is it

DOMINO

My mother liked Doris Day okay
deep breath and starts singing

DOMINO (CONT )
(singing)
Someone like you cures
everything gloomy turns wrong
into right brightens the night
brings happiness to me
Someday I’ll find

She opens her palms and moves her hands back and forth
minstrel-like

DOMINO (CONT )
(laughing and singing)

someone I can boast to
somebody to hug a bug in a rug
to snuggle up close to and
whenever I do do you know who
who who I’ll give the most to
you prey on my mind stay ‘til
I find someone like you

She

She breaks down laughing as does he
They kiss

It is a blissful star-filled wide-eyed laughing kiss and
when they separate a thin trail of saliva links them before
snapping and they both laugh some more Switters rolls onto
his back and looks up at the stars

SWITTERS
Okay now I’m counting them

Domino props up on her elbow her head resting on her hand

DOMINO
You know you said you were in
love with me the first time we
met

SWITTERS
No did I

DOMINO
Yes It is the first thing you
ever said to me

SWITTERS
Well I don’t remember but in
boxing circles they call that
leading with the right

DOMINO
It’s alright I have a big crash
on you along

SWITTERS
Crush You mean you had a big
crush on me

DOMINO
Maybe

She lies on her back

DOMINO (CONT )
When I was in high school in
Philadelphia I was how do you
say

SWITTERS
A drum majorette
DOMINO
No a slut Everyone wanted to
touch me and I quickly learned
how to please them without you
know allowing everything Only
my basketball teacher I ever
allowed to make love to me

SWITTERS
You really don’t need to spill
these kind of beans

DOMINO
Listen I must explain When my
family moved back to France I
threw myself with whole heart
into the arms of the Church Then
I began to pray for the
reinstatement of my virginity
Crazy no But like my aunt I
prayed and prayed and after a
long time it grew back

SWITTERS
You mean your maidenhood

DOMINO
My hymen God gave it back to me
It’s true I have medical proof
Many doctors examined me and
agree Okay no big cotton-pickin’
deal but it is proof of the power
of belief And that is enough
philosophy for one night and now
we can kiss again

She kisses him and reaches down to unbuckle his pants

SWITTERS
Be careful You remember what
happened to the last person who
did that

DOMINO
I’1l take the risk Just count
the stars

SWITTERS
You know it just occurred to me
a way that you can still retain
your virginity

DOMINO
How is that

SWITTERS
Ever heard of the culo

They kiss again as we PULL UP TO THE TWINKLING STARS ABOVE

EXT OUTSIDE CONVENT WALLS - DAY

Switters zips around on the Segway practicing his turns --
he’s really getting good The Convent gate opens and Fannie
steps out holding basket

Switters hides behind the cypress tree She closes the gate
behind her and walks down the hill towards the village
Switters follows at a discrete distance

EXT SYRIAN VILLAGE MARKET —- DAY

Switters follows her through the open-air market He tries to
blend into the crowd as best he can however for this small

Syrian village a Segway is a curiosity

Village folk surround him but he waves them off picking up
speed and trying to outrun them but they follow behind

He turns a corner and sees FANNIE TALKING WITH AUDUBON POE

SWITTERS
Poe

Poe grabs at her basket and shakes it loose A few vegetables
roll onto the ground and he grabs Fannie by the arms

The crowd gathers around Switters He shoos them off but in
doing so KNOCKS SOME COPPER PLATES OFF A STORE’S SHELF

Poe and Fannie look over

Fannie runs off and Poe RUNS RIGHT AT SWITTERS drawing his
gun Switters backs up fleeing down the alley

EXT MARKET ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS

He doesn’t get far Poe JUMPS ON HIS BACK and the extra weight

sends the Segway careening forward and out of control down the
people-filled marketplace

Switters reaches back and tries to shake him off as they
wrestle for control Poe ducks

Switters turns forward and GETS HIT SMACK ON THE FACE WITH
LOW-HANGING FISH ON STRING HE IS HIT BY ANOTHER AND ANOTHER
until he ducks down out of the way the Segway propelling
forward at full speed and into a narrow shop where an OLD
ARABIC MAN beats them with a rolled-up newspaper

INT OLD MAN’S SHOP - CONTINUOUS

They barrel through the narrow shop packed floor-to-ceiling
with touristy items (the Segway pulling everything down and
trailing it all behind them) hit some rugs hanging in back
with full-force THUMP THUMP THUMP sending clouds of dust
in their faces They surprise the Old Man’s son watching tv in
the back duck to avoid the power cord and burst through the
back of the store

EXT BACK ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

The Segway barrels out of the shop and down the alley
dragging the TV and all the touristy goods behind like a just
married train Poe and Switters WRESTLE AND TRADE PUNCHES
each grabbing for control

The Segway heads towards a delicately constructed pile of
spices and nuts They CRASH INTO IT sending nuts scattering
and the spice pile collapsing on top of them Switters is
careful not to let his feet touch the ground

They fight and roll around in the spices covering themselves
in colors Poe jumps up and levels his gun at Switters

POE
Where is it

SWITTERS
I don’t know I swear Who are
you working for

POE
Sorry about this

Poe cocks back the hammer of the gun
Switters holds up his hands in useless defense

POE SNEEZES

SWITTERS KICKS THE GUN OUT OF HIS HAND AND THEN KICKS POE IN
THE CHEST sending him falling backwards into the street
Switters jumps on the Segway and takes off at full speed Poe
grabs his gun and follows

Switters turns a corner and stops
Dead end
Poe comes running around the corner and stops He’s got him

Switters goes to the far end of the alley grabs a long hookah
pipe tucking it under his arm like a jouster and turns back

Poe levels his gun
Switters heads straight for Poe

POE FIRES SWITTERS DUCKS THE BULLET RICOCHETING OFF THE
SEGWAY WHICH CONTINUES RIGHT AT POE the hookah knocking him
off his feet and the gun out of his hand

The gun flies up in the air and Switters grabs it as he
continues out of the alley bouncing around in his hand until
he’s got a handle on it and turns a corner into an open market
full of people Switters looks back to see Poe on the ground

Switters smiles -- until he faces forward to see a CAMEL RIGHT
IN FRONT OF HIM

SWITTERS SMACKS INTO THE CAMEL knocking him off the Segway
and onto his back He holds his feet off the ground looking
up at the underbelly of the growling camel

A crowd of people gather around him

He sees Poe get up and unable to harm Switters with all the
people around back away from the scene THE CAMEL LOWERS HIS
FACE RIGHT OVER SWITTERS AND DROOLS ON HIM

SWITTERS
Who do you think I am John
Ashcroft

EXT CONVENT - DAY
A supply truck is parked out front and a man in a red-and-

white checkered kafiah unloads boxes and carries them into the
convent Switters goes through the open gate

EXT CONVENT COURTYARD —- DAY
Switters drives up to Domino

DOMINO
Where have you been

SWITTERS
Oh just down to the market

DOMINO
What did you do to Fannie

SWITTERS
I didn’t touch the girl I swear
Why what did she say

DOMINO
She didn’t She’s gone

SWITTERS
Gone What do you mean

DOMINO
She never came back from the market
and when we looked in her room all
her belongings were gone

SWITTERS
No note

DOMINO
Nothing

SWITTERS
Darn

DOMINO

What’s going on Who are you

SWITTERS
I am Switters as I say

She looks at him skeptically

SWITTERS (CONT )
Alright I’m looking for an
ancient pagan-looking pyramid
Also the Russian and American
Intelligence services may be after
me about some other mole nonsense
something completely unrelated

DOMINO
A pyramid Oh we have one of
those

SWITTERS
Excuse me

DOMINO

Sure It’s in the pantry

INT CONVENT PANTRY - DAY

Amidst the wine bottles and canned food is a desk covered in
papers and books Switters and Domino watch Masked Beauty dig
through its drawers

MASKED BEAUTY
Fannie said it was a family
heirloom and asked me to keep
it somewhere safe

SWITTERS
When was this

MASKED BEAUTY
This morning Before she left
for the market Here it is

She pulls out the newspaper-wrapped package and hands it to
Switters who carefully unwraps it And there it is the small

golden pyramid Potney stole from the Kremlin Switters holds

it up and turns it over in his hands

DOMINO
What is it

SWITTERS
I don’t know Something very
dangerous Something you don’t
want to have around here

DOMINO
How do you know about this And
think about your answer Because
it better be the truth

Switters takes a deep breath

SWITTERS
I work for the CIA
MASKED BEAUTY
CIA Ooh-la-la

SWITTERS
I guess I should probably say I
used to They seem to think I’m
working for the other side

DOMINO
They think you were lying to
them

SWITTERS
Yes in effect

DOMINO
I can’t imagine how they could
think such a thing

SWITTERS
Listen it wasn’t my intention
to lie to you I just thought it
would be safest There are a
lot of people after this thing
and for your protection I wouldn’t
keep it around for long

DOMINO
I think we’ve had quite enough
of your protection Mr Switters

SWITTERS
That really is the only thing
I’ve lied to you about I swear

DOMINO
You are insincere

SWITTERS
Don’t say that

DOMINO
A liar You don’t mean anything
You say one thing and then
another You don’t know even
when you are lying You come here
as a wolf in sheep’s clothing I
think it is best if you leave
here at once

SWITTERS
But I love you

Masked Beauty’s eyes perk up

DOMINO
Yes that’s the first thing you
said to me I didn’t believe you
then and I didn’t believe you now

SWITTERS
Wait-

DOMINO
Get out And do not come back I
do not wish to see you again

She sticks out her hand -- he hands over the pyramid and she
drops it back in the drawer slamming it closed

INT SUPPLY TRUCK - DAY

The Segway bounces around in the back of the supply truck as
it speeds down the dusty road The driver is the man in the
red-and-white kafiah TOUFIC Switters looks at him

SWITTERS
Italian night

Switters motions to his kafiah but the driver ignores him
staring at the road Switters sighs looking out the window

SWITTERS (CONT )
Women Toufic What are you going
to do I’ve been kicked out the
Garden of Eden and I feel like a
real snake Do snakes have heels
If they did I’d feel like the
heel of a snake All over a
stupid pyramid in an unlocked
drawer

HE PULLS THE PYRAMID out of his crocodile-skin valise

SWITTERS (CONT )
C’mon admit it You’d do the same
Between you and me I don’t feel
great about this Maybe when it’s
all over I’1ll find a way to make
it up to them You don’t care
I’m going to take a hot bath and
lock the door and if the world
wants in well it’s going to have
to knock pretty hard
TOUFIC
See that’s the problem with you
Americans You get involved and
when things get difficult you just
go away

SWITTERS
Oh youre English is quite good
I didn’t realize

TOUFIC
Three years Lebanon University
in Beirut

SWITTERS
Did you take any Modern Poetry

TOUFIC
I want to love America but America
requires me to hate it What is
wrong with your great country
Why does it do such terrible
things

SWITTERS
Three words “genuine imitation
leather” First the cowboys
wiped out the buffalo and then
they built Wall Street Then they
had to make genuine imitation
leather

His cellphone BEEPS

SWITTERS (CONT )
Hang on

He takes it out and looks at a text message

FROM SUZY -- “WHERE R U”
He fumbles to respond -- “miss me”
RESPONSE -- “WHAT HAPPENED TO MY PARROT YOU DEGENERATE”

Switters quickly tosses the phone back in the bag

SWITTERS (CONT )
Sorry what were you saying

TOUFIC
Americans are a generous and good
(MORE )

TOUFIC (cont’d)
people the ones I have met but
as a country I must oppose them

SWITTERS
It’s only natural Terrorism is
the only logical response to
America just as street crime is
the only logical response to
America’s drug policy But
America has something special
It has bounce It has snap

The truck hits a BIG BOUNCE and the pyramid comes flying out
of Switters’ hand onto the floor He picks it up -- a panel
has opened and electrical wires dangle out

SWITTERS (CONT )
Now that’s interesting

He picks up the pyramid and pulls out more and more wiring
SWITTERS (CONT )
That’s very interesting
EXT GAS STATION - DAY
Toufic fills up the truck as Switters sits with the door open

CONNECTING THE WIRING IN THE PYRAMID TO HIS VIDEO CAMERA AND
REWINDING TO FOOTAGE OF SAILOR BOY IN HIS CAGE ON THE RIVER

SWITTERS
That’s it Right there

He looks up and sees TWO ARAB MEN who look suspiciously
similar to Switters The Russians

Toufic talks with one of them pointing back in the direction
of the Convent gets back in the car and starts the engine

SWITTERS
Hold your fucking camels Toufic
What did that man say to you

TOUFIC
He asked if he was going in the
right direction for the nuns

SWITTERS
That’s it We’re going back The
nuns are in danger

TOUFIC
I must go to Damascus

SWITTERS
Then I’m going alone

EXT SYRIAN DESERT - DAY

Switters drives his Segway across the barren landscape at full
speed alone in the desert wilderness holding his valise

EXT OUTSIDE CONVENT - DAY

As Switters approaches the entrance to the compound he sees
the car from the gas station parked out front and the gate
broken open Switters circles around to the back

EXT BACK OF CONVENT - DAY

Switters pulls up to the back wall Reaching up the top of
the wall is just out of his grasp

He backs up to get a running start

HE FLOORS THE SEGWAY RIGHT TOWARDS THE WALL IT HITS A
ROCK SENDING HIM FLYING UP IN THE AIR TOWARDS THE WALL WHICH
HE GRABS WITH BOTH ARMS

The Segway crashes into the wall smashing apart

Switters pulls himself up over the wall with two arms hanging
over the top looking down into the courtyard where he sees
one of the nuns (ZuZu) cowering behind the garden shed

SWITTERS
Pssst ZuZu Up here

ZUZU
Monsieur Switters

SWITTERS
Quick Bring me the stilts The
stilts Les échasses

ZUZU
Les 6chasses

SWITTERS
Oui The fucking circus is back in
town
EXT CONVENT COURTYARD —- DAY
The Russians stand around the frightened nuns

RUSSIAN
We want ze pyramid

DOMINO
I told you we don’t have it

SWITTERS
UNHAND THOSE NUNS

Suddenly around the corner comes Switters WALKING ON THE
LONG STILTS 10 FEET OFF THE GROUND

They all stare in shock

He takes long tenuous steps and brushes his head against the
tree branches which almost knock him over Teetering and
staggering towards them he gains too much momentum goes past
them and has to circle back

SWITTERS (CONT )
You are trespassing on Vatican
property I’1ll have you know this
compound is under the personal
protection of Bashar al-Assad
Doris Day and Audubon Poe

One of the Russians grabs Masked Beauty and pulls off her
veil revealing her huge nasal mole

He gasps

SWITTERS (CONT)
That’s no way to treat a lady
Are you aware of the Geneva
Convention

DOMINO
Yes if you do not leave matters
will be turned over to our Chief
of Security

She nods towards Switters One of the Russians pulls out a gun
and the nuns step back in fear

SWITTERS
(pulling out his gun)
I have one of those too Care
to see which one’s louder

HE REARS BACK AND KICKS ONE OF THE RUSSIANS IN THE SHINS WITH
HIS STILTS KNOCKING HIM BACKWARDS HOWLING IN PAIN

Switters also staggers back flailing his gun and trying to
keep his balance A group of goats come into the yard and run
between Switters’ stilts causing to wobble backwards losing
more balance until he falls ass-backwards into a bush

BLAM

His gun fires ricocheting off the ground and HITTING MASKED
BEAUTY IN THE FACE She goes down Domino rushes to her side
looking back at the Russians with fire in her eyes

DOMINO
Get out of here right now

The Russians back up run out of the compound jump into their
car and drive away Switters sits up in the bush

DOMINO (CONT )
(to Switters)
You reckless maniac Your
irresponsible macho gunplay has
disfigured my aunt

Sitting up Masked Beauty reveals that her mole has been shot
clear off leaving a smooth perfect nose

INT MASKED BEAUTY’S BEDROOM - DAY

Domino attends to Masked Beauty who rests peacefully in bed
She caps a bottle of iodine and leaves closing the door
quietly behind her Outside Switters sits in his wheelchair

DOMINO
So you are back in this thing

SWITTERS
My other ride is in the shop
How is she

DOMINO
Shocked but she’1ll recover

Domino crosses her arms She holds out her hand Sheepishly
he hands over the pyramid

DOMINO (CONT )
Stealing from nuns Really

SWITTERS
I think you underestimate the
power of this curse

DOMINO
Your only curse is your selfishness

SWITTERS
You have to believe me I never
intended any harm to come to you
or your Sisters

DOMINO
And neither do I Which is why
we’re going to return the relic
to its rightful owners Since
there is some dispute we must
let the Vatican decide

SWITTERS
You’re going to give it to Rome

DOMINO
Yes We voted and we’re going to
present it ourselves to the Holy
See

SWITTERS
Then I insist you let me come
with you The journey will be
perilous and there are those
who will stop at nothing to
get it from you

DOMINO
I think you’ve done quite enough
already And there is no reason
for anyone to hurt us We’re flies

SWITTERS
People swat flies And you must
insist on handing it to the Pope
directly Don’t trust anyone

DOMINO
You don’t trust the Vatican

SWITTERS
The Swiss Guard haven’t fired
a shot in five hundred years
Think they’re a bit trigger
happy I’ve gotten you into this
(MORE)

SWITTERS (contd)
mess I’m not going to abandon
you now So what do you say

DOMINO
I say you’re out of your cotton-
pickin’ mind

INT DAMASCUS AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY
The nuns boar an Alitalia plane Domino looks back at Switters

who sits in his wheelchair dressed in a nun’s habit with
Masked Beauty’s veil He makes a call on his cellphone

INT MAESTRA’S HOME - DAY

Bobby Case’s cellphone vibrates on the table We see two pairs
of intertwined feet and hear love-making noises

His cellphone goes to voicemail

SWITTERS (VO)
Bobby this is your old pal
Switters Although you wouldn’t
think it to look at me You
could say my looks are becoming
a distraction Anyway I’m going
to need your help

INT ALITALIA FLIGHT - DAY

THE STEWARDESS walks down the aisle Towards the back of the
plane sit our five nuns Switters included She stares at him
with her mouth open That’s one ugly nun

SWITTERS
Thank God signorina Do you have
anything without chickpeas It’s
all Ive had for three weeks And
bring me some alcohol too Let’s
blow this falafel stand

(looking at Domino)

This is gonna get ugly isn’t it

EXT DAMASCUS AIRPORT RUNWAY - DAY

The Alitalia plane turns down the runway picking up speed and
takes off over the ancient Syrian capitol

EXT SIDE ENTRANCE TO VATICAN CITY - DAY

The nuns pile out of a Vatican minivan Switters is lowered by
a handicapped lift A CARDINAL with black greased-back hair
comes out to greet them his hands folded in front of him

CARDINAL

Hello Sisters Welcome to Vatican
City His Holiness eagerly awaits
your visit

(to Switters)
And if you sir could please
leave your firearm concealed in
that briefcase We will lock it
in our vault and I assure you it
will be returned after your visit

SWITTERS
Told you these guys were good

CARDINAL
Right this way please

TWO SWISS GUARDS take the valise and escort the group through
a wood-paneled lobby and out a door into a grand garden

EXT VATICAN GARDENS - DAY

The nuns are led through a manicured garden and join a long
line of people waiting for an audience with THE POPE who
stands under an ivy-covered pavillion

CARDINAL
Do you have the relic

DOMINO
Yes we do

She pulls out the newspaper-wrapped package

CARDINAL
Wonderful Please present it to
the Cardinal standing next to His
Holiness and then you may receive
blessings

SWITTERS
Oh no we don’t The deal was we
give it to the Holy Kielbasa
himself

Domino KICKS him
SWITTERS (CONT)
Ow That hurt

DOMINO
(to the Cardinal)
That will be fine We are sure
that in his wisdom The Holy
Father will know what to do

CARDINAL
That is very sensible Sister
And in light of the diplomatic
sensitivity of the situation
we appreciate you bringing the
item directly to us You are a
beacon of the Lord’s light

SWITTERS
Puh-lease

DOMINO
(ignoring him)
You’re welcome

CARDINAL
Although it may have been better
if you left him behind

DOMINO
Your Eminence I’m beginning to
think the same thing But it is
our preference

CARDINAL
And so it shall be

He nods and backs away

SWITTERS
Think anyone ever told him that
it looks like the Exxon Valdez
has run aground in his hair

The line moves closer towards the Pope ANOTHER CARDINAL
approaches Domino He looks familiar to Switters that’s
no Cardinal but AUDUBON POE He leads her up the steps

POE
Right this way please

SWITTERS
Wait That’s no Missionary
It’s a Mercenary

Everyone turns to look at him One of the Swiss Guards puts
his hand on Switters’ wheelchair holding him back

Domino is led off into a side garden away where she is
surrounded by Poe and other men Switters can see her
clutching the pyramid to her chest and shaking her head Poe
pulls the package out of her hands
DOMINO
No no This isn’t right You
can’t do this
SWITTERS
STOP YOU MOTHER-FUCKER TAKE YOUR
HANDS OFF OF HER

Everyone is shocked and moves away from him The Pope is
whisked away

Poe unravels the package layer by layer -- BUT INSTEAD OF THE
PYRAMID IT IS THE CD OF BROADWAY SHOWTUNES AND A SMALL ROCK

Poe grabs Domino by the shoulders

The Swiss Guard grabs Switters BUT HE FLIPS THE GUARD’S ARM
BACKWARDS BREAKING IT INSTANTLY

The Swiss Guard falls back in pain

Switters holds out his foot and looks at the ground in
order to save her he must walk up the steps

He can’t do it

He sees Domino pulled away looking back at him for help
Switters holds his foot in the air as if an invisible force is
preventing him from going any further He is either going to
have to step on the ground or watch Domino get dragged away

SWITTERS STEPS OUT OF THE WHEELCHAIR

THE MOMENT HIS FOOT TOUCHES THE GROUND THERE IS A FLASH OF
WHITE HE HEARS A “POP” AND COLLAPSES ON THE GROUND

EVERYTHING TURNS TO BLACK
COMPLETE DARKNESS

In the darkness we hear a few whirls of wind or maybe a
distance ocean

Then a coughing

More of a clearing of the throat

The blackness lightens a bit and we begin to
objects in a room

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Switters wakes up As his eyes adjust to the
can make out a man sitting in a chair across
crossed and looking at his fingernails as if
manicure It’s Poe

SWITTERS
What happened Where am I

POE
Probably think you’re having some
trendy near-death experience I
expect

SWITTERS
Poe You’re here

POE
Why who did you expect The man
in a white-beard

SWITTERS
The taboo It’s taken me

POE
No you fool You fainted

SWITTERS
No it was End-of-Time’s curse
It hit me like a poisoned hammer
all the way from the Amazon

POE
You slipped fell and hit your
head on the concrete steps It
sounded like a coconut cracking
Youve been out for five days

SWITTERS
Five days And what about the
curse
POE

I don’t know anything about a
curse My job is to get the
pyramid The rest is your affair

pick out hazy

light of room he
from him legs
he’s just had a

SWITTERS
If there is no curse then Potney’s
still alive Son of a bitch

Poe scoots up to the bed

POE
I don’t know what you’re
blathering about All I know is
that you have what I want My
business is with you

SWITTERS
Whom are you working for

POE
If I were an ethical man I’d cut
you in on the deal But I’m not
I’m greedy and vengeful Now
where’s the pyramid

SWITTERS
Not so fast hot stuff It appears
that my general sense of misgiving
has paid off You want the pyramid
you’re going to have to cut me in
after all

POE
Not really We have the nuns
Including the one you seem so
protective of Domino I believe
her name is Ludicrous what
people name their kids today

Switters looks at him He has no play
SWITTERS
The coat check at the Vatican
It’s in my valise
Poe brushes off his trousers gets up and looks back
POE
Oh and if it’s not there I’1l
come back and we won’t talk

He leaves the room

Switters waits a moment and jumps out of bed -- he collapses
on the ground pulling down the sheets with him

SWITTERS
Atrophy

Wrapped in the bedsheets he gingerly gets up and walks over
to the window with chicken-legs He rubs them for circulation
and looks at the street below -- several stories down he sees
Poe walk out of the main entrance to the hospital

Switters looks back at the door -- doctors and nurses linger
in the hallway No exit there

He pushes open the window and steps out onto a rickety
scaffolding which covers the outside of the building

EXT SCAFFOLDING - CONTINUOUS

He swings his leg over surprising an ITALIAN CONSTRUCTION
WORKER

SWITTERS
Excuse me

CONSTRUCTION WORKER
Chi il fotte la sono Andara
via da qui Andara via da qui

The construction worker continues to yell at him but Switters
walks carefully past

Switters reaches the end of the scaffolding and sees that
there is a ladder down to a lower one He climbs down that
ladder and across the lower scaffolding encountering ANOTHER
ITALIAN who also screams at him

SWITTERS
Who are you the Mario Brothers

He continues to the end and turns to see the worker ACTUALLY
ROLL A SMALL BARREL TOWARDS HIM

Quickly Switters lowers himself down the ladder to another
scaffolding and from afar the whole scene looks like a screen
from DONKEY KONG

- -Switters goes down one level the barrel bouncing over
his head and leaping over another one

He continues to the end of the scaffolding but this time there
is no ladder at the end The street is three stories below

He wraps the sheets around both his ankles and holds the other
corners in his hands

He JUMPS

And like a flying squirrel the sheet catches the wind
slowing him down

He hits the sidewalk with a THUD

SWITTERS
Ow my fucking legs

He looks up and sees Poe get into a taxi and disappear into
the busy Roman traffic

A CAR SCREECHES TO A HALT RIGHT BEHIND HIM
Switters looks back and sees the passenger door open and ONE
OF THE RUSSIANS step out of the car (an Opel) and walk over to

Switters with his arm cocked ready to punch him

SWITTERS (CONT)
Opel

BLAM THE RUSSIAN PUNCHES HIM IN THE FACE KNOCKING HIM OUT

Black Again

INT WAREHOUSE —- DAY

This time Switters comes to sitting upright in a chair Across
from him are the Russians one of them eating spaghetti

SWITTERS

RUSSIAN
We know Your friend Poe has it
He wants five million dollars

SWITTERS

RUSSIAN

torturing you Now we only must
dispose you
He sees two

SWITTERS
It has occurred to me that we
can be of great use to each other

RUSSIAN
Explain

SWITTERS
Well first of all Poe will try
to screw you Take your money
give you some cheap knockoff and
disappear I happen to be in the
unique position to be able to
verify the object’s authenticity
I need Poe’s contact you need
the pyramid Let’s work together
They’ve got my nuns I’m not
going to do anything rash Plus
youll be there Shoot me if
anything goes wrong

RUSSIAN
And why should I trust you

SWITTERS
Because I have a plan

round scars on the Russian’s wrist

SWITTERS
Excuse me but is that a snake
bite

RUSSIAN
A boa in the Cambodian jungle

SWITTERS
(motioning to scars on his face)
Venom

RUSSIAN
Yes It happened back when we were
called KGB

SWITTERS
Look Poe’s got what you want and
he’s got what I want and I know
how we can get them both After
all “neither man nor nation can
exist without a sublime idea”
That’s-

RUSSIAN
Dostoyevsky yes You quote
Russian author to butter me off

SWITTERS
It’s “up” everyone’s making that
mistake And not an author the
Grand Master of Russian letters

(pouring the Russian more wine)

So where’s the handoff

If anything happens to them I’m
going to kill you or get somebody

really good to kill you

POE
The nuns will be released just
as soon as I get back with that
briefcase Let me see the money

Switters cracks open the briefcase and flips through some
bills snapping it shut Poe shows him the pyramid in the bag

They stare at each other

SWITTERS
And I want my valise back With
the Showtunes CD

Poe nods

Slowly simultaneously they hand their packages to each
other With his left hand Switters takes the pyramid and with
his right he hands over the briefcase

They’re still for a moment holding both items with each hand

THEN POE WRENCHES THE BRIEFCASE AWAY AND TOSSES THE PYRAMID
OVER THE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE

A sniper shot fires hitting the ledge of the bridge just
missing Switters

Poe takes off with the briefcase in the other direction
Switters ducks down and crawls over to the side of the bridge
He looks down -- the pyramid has landed on a little island in
the river around one of the bridge supports

The “sketch-artist” Russian jumps off the bridge and dives
into the water swimming towards the island

Switters looks up and sees Poe blend into the crowd of people
He gets up and chases him ducking sniper fire

Switters runs off the bridge and turns a corner The streets
are covered with people Switters jumps up on the roof of a
car and searches the crowd -- no sign of Poe

He grabs a flagpole and pulls himself higher over the crowd --
seeing Poe duck down an alleyway Switters jumps back down on
the car and an AMERICAN TOURIST waves money at him

AMERICAN TOURIST
Sing for us

SWITTERS
The CIA really did kill JFK
He jumps down grabs the money and runs down a side street He
sees Poe up ahead looking back over his shoulder Switters
ducks into a store It’s a cheap clothing store and amongst
the touristy t-shirts he sees a straw hat Switters shoves his
money on the counter

EXT ROME STREET - DAY

Poe walks quickly up the quiet street looking at reflections
in store windows for tails He spots the straw hat

Poe spins around to see an OLD ITALIAN MAN WEARING THE STRAW
HAT leaning against a car across the street Switters is
actually ducked down behind the old man holding his fingers to
his lips begging him to be quiet

Poe continues down the street and Switters jumps up kisses
the man on the cheek and follows

Poe turns into a small hotel Pensione Paradise Switters
looks up at the windows -- only one of them has its curtains
fully drawn He crosses the street entering the pensione

INT PENSIONE PARADISE HALLWAY - DAY

It’s a dark rather shabby place Switters walks down a
hallway of doors He stops at one and takes a deep breath

He reaches out for the handle

Just as he’s about to touch it the door bursts open and Poe
stands there pointing a gun at him

POE
Come on in

He turns and Switters follows him into the room

INT PENSIONE PARADISE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The frightened nuns sit on a bed shocked to see Switters

DOMINO
Switters
PIPPI
You can walk
SWITTERS

Praise Jesus

He continues into the room and sees POTNEY SMITHE sitting in
the corner taking money out of the briefcase and into a bag

SWITTERS
Potney you son of a bitch

POTNEY
Oh hullo old chap Surprised to
see me

SWITTERS
Not exactly I knew there would
be some evil bastard at the bottom
of this So there never was a
curse You stole the pyramid knew
the Russians would kill you if
you tried to sell it so you
faked your death and used Poe as
a middleman to sell it back to
them But why me Why did you have
to drag me into your fiendish plot

POTNEY
Luck Happened to run into you in
Peru and figured you’d be as good
as anyone to verify my death

SWITTERS
What about the tribe End-of-Time

POE

A Peruvian wedding band I hired

out of Lima
FLASHBACK --
EXT LIMA HILTON - EVENING
Members of the Kandakanero tribe unload music equipment from a
van dressed now in matching ruffled shirts and blue tuxedos
The band leader End-of-Time steps out of the van and looks
around drinking from a bottle of spring water
INT PENSIONE PARADISE ROOM - PRESENT
Poe motions for Switters to sit next to the nuns

POTNEY

It was Poe’s idea to get you to
retrieve the pyramid
Potney kicks over the bag and Poe glances down at it keeping

SWITTERS
Why not I was already knee-deep
You had it all worked out

POTNEY
Indeed And I can’t help but say
that it’s all been rather fun
Now you must excuse me
(to Poe)
Well it’s all there Every last
ruble Your share is in the bag

POE
Bring it over

his gun trained on Switters

POE (CONT )
We’re good

POTNEY
Right Now I’m going to slowly back
up towards the door and I want you
to wait ten minutes before leaving
Mister Poe it has been a pleasure
doing business with you I hope to
never see any of you again

POE
What do we do about him

POTNEY
Oh it doesn’t matter You led him
back here he’s your problem Shoot
him if you want Shoot them all

The nuns gasp

Potney slowly backs up towards the door holding the briefcase
in front of him He reaches back for the handle holding it

for a moment He’s searching for a good last line

POTNEY (CONT )
Get stuffed

He turns and runs out the door slamming behind him

Beat

Everyone sits still

SWITTERS
Well this is awkward
DOMINO
You mean you don’t have any ideas
SWITTERS
No
DOMINO

What kind of CIA man are you What
were you planning to do once you
got here

SWITTERS
Hadn’t really thought it through
that far

DOMINO

Not much of a rescue then is it

SWITTERS

Sorry
(checking his watch)
I did make a phone call

Poe picks up the bag with one hand keeping his gun leveled at
Switters and the nuns He opens the dresser drawer and pulls
out a silencer which he puts in his mouth With his teeth he
slowly turns the silencer onto the gun his eyes on Switters

The nuns are crying and holding each other

SWITTERS (CONT)
Not the nuns okay

POE
Don’t worry I’m just going to
slow you down a bit

SWITTERS
I can’t believe I’m saying this
but could you shoot me in the
legs Below the kneecap

POE
Of course

Just as Poe sets his sights on Switters A WHIRLING AND HUMMING
NOISE COMES FROM OUTSIDE THE WINDOW Poe draws the curtains --
hovering right outside is Bobby Case flying a helicopter
Maestra is in the passenger seat who gives Poe the finger
SWITTERS
The fucking cavalry About time

INT PENSIONE PARADISE ROOM - DAY

Poe is handcuffed and carted off by CIA OFFICERS Switters
Bobby Case Maestra and the nuns sit around the room

SWITTERS
Maestra How did you get dragged
into all of this

MAESTRA
I’ll be asking the questions around
here mister What have you done
with my parrot you ingrate

BOBBY CASE
Easy darling All in good time
SWITTERS
Darling
DOMINO

I demand to know what’s going on

BOBBY CASE
Yes this I’d like to hear

SWITTERS
The CIA’s known about Potney’s
pyramid scheme all along Since I
was already injected in the arena
they decided to let me cook
hoping I’d retrieve the item
without the Russians suspecting
their involvement Pretty standard
stuff But I expected better out
of you Bobby You could have
shared some Intel with me

BOBBY CASE
Hold yer horses partner You
were not on a need to know and we
weren’t sure what was getting
leaked When did you figure it
all out incidentally

SWITTERS
When I looked inside the pyramid
and saw it was full of electrical
(MORE)
SWITTERS (contd)
wiring unavailable to ancient
Peruvians three thousand years ago

DOMINO
Electrical wiring What is it

SWITTERSBOBBY CASE
A listening device

BOBBY CASE
Specifically America’s most
valuably placed listening device
We’ve been listening to Russian
pillow talk for twenty-five years
Some in the Intel Community believe
it’s one of the main reasons why
the Berlin Wall fell

FLASHBACK --
INT VATICAN COAT CHECK - DAY

The Bishop who took Switters’ valise (“Exxon Valdez”) hands
to the coat checker -- Bobby Case in disguise

BOBBY CASE (VO)
The batteries were running low
Once we learned Potney had
kleptoed it we figured wed take
the opportunity to replace ‘em

INT PENSIONE PARADISE - PRESENT

DOMINO
So this whole escapade was just
to replace some batteries

BOBBY CASE
They’1l be newer longer lasting
Congratulations Switters you’ve
done your country a great service
You all have You’ve been part of
one of the most important Intel
gathering operations in the books
Off the record of course

SWITTERS
But did you have to involve my
grandmother

it
MAESTRA
That’s it Bobby I haven’t
spanked him for thirty-five years
but that’s the final straw

Bobby Case holds her back

BOBBY CASE
Listen I was investigating that
mole and after Hector Sumac’s
disappearance well I thought it
might have been you Sorry So
while you were gone instead of
going to Peru I went to look
through your house But not to
worry your name is clear

SWITTERS
You found the mole

BOBBY CASE
No you were right There never
was a mole It was a wild goose
chase all along

SWITTERS
What about Hector Sumac
BOBBY CASE
Found him in St Petersburg
SWITTERS
Russia
BOBBY CASE

No Florida The one with the
Hooters He was on vacation We
think he’s going to be one of our
most productive agents

SWITTERS
You lied to me from day one

BOBBY CASE
Don’t take it personally kid You
know how it goes

SWITTERS
You put all these nuns lives in
jeopardy for some esoteric
political gains
Beat

BOBBY CASE
All in a days work Hey c’mon
everything worked out The
Russians got their pyramid back
your curse is lifted and weve
got a top secret listening device
back in play

SWITTERS

But you misplayed one card Bobby

BOBBY CASE
And what’s that

SWITTERS
You were banking on the fact that
when the dust settled Id walk
away a bit sore but ultimately
not care Well I’m going to shock
you I do care You abused our
friendship and took me for
granted as an amoral self-serving
survivalist

BOBBY CASE
Aren’t you

SWITTERS

At times Less now And I’m not
going to let you flag-waving
Bible-thumping Cowboys ruin my
CIA And I’m not going to quit
either I’m going to stick around
and undermine all the evil lies
we perpetrate every day Switters

is back with a full tank of wahoo

And he’s going to start shaking
things up

BOBBY CASE
Be my guest In fact why not
start right here and for instance
tell this wonderful remarkable
loving woman who practically
raised you what really happened
to her parrot

All eyes are on him

MAESTRA
This had better be good
SWITTERS
Ahhh

Switters looks at Domino who encourages him

SWITTERS (CONT )
Sailor Boy is dead

He takes a deep breath

SWITTERS (CONT )
And I may have eaten him
(Domino nudges him on)
Actually I did eat him Tasted
like chicken I’m sorry

MAESTRA ATTACKS -- throwing herself at him in a violent rage
arm bracelets clanging at her sides She has to be restrained
by two CIA men She reaches for one of their guns but the
Operative wrests it out of her hands

MAESTRA
No wait Wait a minute I would
just like to say something to him

They let up AND SHE ATTACKS AGAIN -- more energy than you’d
expect from a septuagenarian She lets up and they stop but
stay close enough to restrain her in case of another attack

MAESTRA (CONT )
Alright Alright Switters I
always thought that you were a cut
above the prideful narcissists of
your generation My wish when I
charged you with Sailor Boy was
that in caring for another
creature of this earth you would
awaken something inside of you As
irate as I am I cannot help but be
proud It’s clear to me now that
the long dormant romantic spirit
is alive within you Go Be free
to be yourself

Switters smiles Bobby Case kisses her hand

SWITTERS
Love is in the air The room is
filling with forgiveness I too
have found a pickled jar of the
good stuff we call love Maestra
meet Domino
The women look at each other Maestra walks over and they
circle each other

MAESTRADOMINO
I approve

INT ROME TAXI - DAY

Potney sits in the back seat with the briefcase on his lap
singing to himself and jumping up and down on the seat

POTNEY
I did it I did it Wait this
isn’t the airport This is where
you picked me up

The back door opens and Bobby Case leans against the window

POTNEY (CONT )
Bollocks

BOBBY CASE
Ever heard of the witness
protection program

POTNEY
Yes

BOBBY CASE
Well you’re not going on it

Bobby Case takes the briefcase as Switters and Domino walk out
of the Pensione Paradise together They approach the cab

BOBBY CASE
(to Potney)

Disappear And if you ever say
anything about any of this to

anyone I’1ll let the Russians

know you’re still alive and I

won’t have to come after you

They’1ll jab you with a poison

umbrella in your sleep

POTNEY
What am I supposed to do for a
living

SWITTERS

Potney you are wholly unethical
and a complete egotist You’ve
(MORE )
SWITTERS (contd)
already tried Academia I suggest
you stand for Parliament

He puts his arm around Domino and they walk away and they
continue down the street arm-in-arm nun and CIA man

SWITTERS (VO)
I really meant it when I said I
was tired of the Cowboys at the
Company creating international
incidents embarrassing the
United States and getting
innocent people killed I hada
plan And it involved Domino

SWITTERS
Sorry to have dragged you into
all of this

DOMINO
That’s alright Italian night was
getting kind of stale anyway

SWITTERS
What if I told you I had a plan

DOMINO
I’d run the other way

SWITTERS
I know it sounds crazy but what
if we went around the world
working behind the scenes to
distract the powerful and
covertly thwart their ambitions

DOMINO
Is that some kind of proposal

SWITTERS
I’m not asking you to leave the
Church or anything I’m saying
take it with you In fact I’1ll
join your Church The only Church
that ever was The human heart

They stop in the middle of the street and kiss People stop
and stare Parents bring their children indoors

SWITTERS (CONT )
So what do you think
DOMINO
I think Switters that despite
your habitual lying and reckless
behavior you can make anything
in life seem funny and grand
What do I think I think you’re
crazy -But I’1ll go anyway

SWITTERS
That’s great

They kiss again

EXT SEATTLE SKYLINE - DAY

PAN ACROSS the familiar gray cityscape from Pike Place Market
through the parks and into the hills of the Magnolia District

SWITTERS (VO)
I got a call from Suzy who told
me she was enjoying her first
semester at college where she
had sex for the first time
Since then she said she had been
praying for something ridiculous
Something impossible That Mother
Mary would restore her virginity
When she asked if I believed
in miracles I took a deep
breath and said “they happen
all the time”

EXT BANGKOK STREET - EVENING

WE PUSH IN ON a small corner bar on a rainy Bangkok street
over the opening strains of Tony Bennett singing “Just in
Time” CONTINUING THROUGH THE NEXT FEW SCENES --

SWITTERS (VO) (CONT )
The Baht was weak against the
dollar I flew to Bangkok to
clear the coconut A back-alley
tailor made me a new linen suit

to the music in his new suit

heavy under the sheets with some spicy Slavic lass PAN OVER

a lot like Tony Bennett

END OF TIME
(singing)

the way To drop in on a friend

Walken takes a cup of coffee The lid hasn’t been secured

You slipped up during my polygraph
when you told me you had a friend
who was bitten by a snake in the
Cambodian jungle Well I met that
friend He’s a Russian Agent And
there’s no record in your file of
going to Cambodia

Walken smiles shrugs his shoulders and takes off down the

operatives look up from their lunches Walken stops He’s
trapped He begins to tap-dance

corner out of sight watching him dance She takes his hand
and joins them They are the only ones dancing in the bar
SWITTERS (VO)
We’re starting a new club Domino
and I A new organization in which
we’ll roam the world following my
missions and her good Christian
charity subverting the subversion
as it were and then just wing it
from there A couple of monkey

well deface a few advertisements
Vandalize some golf courses
