EXT NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT 1947 FLASHBACK

City lights The soaring bridges and glowing windows of New
York City The SOUNDS of a cocktail party

INT GREENWICH VILLAGE APARTMENT - NIGHT 1947 FLASHBACK
A party of bohemian types in the village Artists
propped up against the walls A narrow hallway with

talking intimately Two rooms crammed with young people
smoking and drinking

A man and a woman in their 20s stand alone in a corner
FRANK WHEELER intelligent good-looks and APRIL JOHNSON a
patrician beauty a woman amongst girls Hes been making

her laugh

FRANK
So what do you do

APRIL
Im studying to be an actress
You

FRANK

APRIL
(smiles)
No I mean really

FRANK
I mean really too Starting
Monday though Im doing something
a little more glamorous Night
cashier at a cafeteria

APRIL
(smiles)
I dont mean how you make money I
mean what are you interested in

FRANK
Honey - if I had the answer to that
one I bet Id bore us both to
death in half an hour

She laughs He smiles revelling in her attention

INT GREENWICH VILLAGE APARTMENT - NIGHT 1947 LATER

Later Frank and April dance They move well in sync
looking into each others eyes He slides his hand down the
silk of Aprils dress until it rests in the small of her
back

Close on their hands Their fingers slowly entwine as they
lose themselves in each other

SMASH CUT TO

INT AUDITORIUM - NIGHT PRESENT

Close on Franks face seven years later full of doubt and
tension as he watches his wife April on stage and as we
hear the hollow VOICES of a very bad amateur play

Finally mercifully the curtain falls Nothing Then
vigorous relieved applause

Frank hears a voice from behind through the applause

WOMAN
Thank God thats over

April takes the final bow Shes fighting not to cry Frank
applauds her loudly Looks around to see who else is joining
him But there is no noticeable crescendo in the applause

Then Frank hears the voice again

WOMAN (CONTD)
And she was very disappointing
members

He cant argue

INT HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT MOMENTS LATER
Frank now moves against the crowd of exiting audience

towards the stage He keeps his head lowered avoiding eye-
contact until he feels a hand on his sleeve

MR AND MRS GIVINGS an older couple are standing in his
way

MRS GIVINGS
Frank Very nice Frank

FRANK
Thanks Mrs Givings

Frank steps around her
MRS GIVINGS
I cant tell you how much we
enjoyed it You have a very
talented wife
Frank forces a smile as he goes
FRANK
Ill pass it along

INT DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

April sits alone at her dressing table crying

INT BACK STAGE - NIGHT

The CAST mills backstage The mood is subdued but some have
decided to make light of the disaster

Frank moves through the crowd Across the room he sees -
MILLY CAMPBELL 30s determinedly bright up on her tip-

toes Her husband SHEP 30s heavy-set is still in
costume shell-shocked and pebbled with sweat
MILLY
Frank

Hi

MILLY
Shes through there
(points)
You “bout ready for that drink

FRANK
Couple of minutes

INT DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Frank enters The chair in front of the mirror is empty A
cigarette burns in the ashtray Frank glances at a standing
screen in the corner Aprils costume is draped over the
top He goes towards it deciding what to say

FRANK
(heartfelt)
April sweetheart You were great
I mean it

The door to the bathroom opens April enters in street
clothes Franks been talking to an empty room

APRIL
Hi You about ready to leave
Ive just got to get this makeup
off then we can go

She sits in front of the mirror too embarrassed to look at
him FRANK can see that her face is blotchy from crying He
puts his hand on her shoulder

FRANK
Well I guess it wasnt a triumph
or anything was it

APRIL looks at him in the mirror She holds his look just a
second And from her expression he knows he said exactly

the wrong thing

APRIL
I guess not Ill be ready ina
minute

FRANK
Take your time

He removes his hands and lights a cigarette APRIL
begins to
take off her makeup

APRIL
Will you do me a favor Milly and
Shep wanted us to go out with them
afterwards Will you say we cant
Say its because of the baby sitter
or something
FRANK
Well the thing is I already said
that we could I mean I just saw
them out there and I said we would
APRIL
(tense)
Oh Then would you mind going out
again and saying you were mistaken
That should be simple enough
FRANK
Dont you think thats a little bit
rude April
APRIL
Well Ill tell them myself
FRANK
Okay Okay Take it easy Ill
tell them
He backs to the door
INT HIGH-SCHOOL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
April and Frank walk down a long empty echoing corridor
past

school lockers booster club posters and silent classrooms
They dont touch They dont speak The tension between
them is palpable

INT WHEELER CAR - NIGHT

Frank drives April stares ahead Their faces are lit by
the dashboard After a while

FRANK
I mean it baby You were the only
person in that play

APRIL
Thank you

He looks over at her

FRANK
We just never shouldve let you get
mixed up in the damned thing

APRIL
All right

FRANK
Youve studied for Christs sake

APRIL
Could we sort of stop talking about
it now

FRANK

Sure I just dont want you
feeling bad about it thats all
Because its not worth it I mean
its bad enough having to live out
here among these damn people -
whatd you say

APRIL
I said yes All right Frank
Could you just stop talking now
before you drive me crazy please

Frank clenches his jaw and flips on the indicator

APRIL (CONTD)

He puts his arms around her

FRANK

APRIL

FRANK
April
APRIL
Why cant youjust LEAVE ME
ALONE
Frank slides back behind the wheel Beat
FRANK

It strikes me that theres a
considerable amount of bullshit
going on here And theres one
or two things Id like to clear up
Number one its not my fault the
play was lousy Number two its
sure as hell not my fault you
didnt turn out to be an actress
and the sooner you get over that
little piece of soap opera the
better off well both be Number
three I dont happen to fit the
role of dumb insensitive suburban
husband youve been trying to hang
that one on me ever since we moved
here Number four -

She opens the door and is out of the car flashing across

headlights Frank struggles with his door

EXT HIGHWAY SHOULDER - NIGHT

April stands in the dark 30 yards from the road looking over
an expansive countryside Theres only a few lights in the
distance This is still farmland

Frank comes up behind her careful to keep his distance

FRANK
What the hell are you doing Come
back to the car

APRIL
No Just let me stand here a
second

Frank raises his arms in exasperation A car approaches

puts a hand in his pocket and tries to look casual The
cars headlights light up Aprils back then pass

FRANK
April

She doesnt move

FRANK (CONTD)
Look cant we sit in the car and
talk about it instead of running
all over Route Twelve

APRIL
Havent I made it clear I dont
particularly want to talk about it

FRANK
Okay Jesus Im trying to be nice
about this thing

APRIL
How kind of you How terribly
terribly kind of you

FRANK
Wait a minute I dont deserve
this

APRIL
Youre always so wonderfully
definite arent you on the
subject of what you do and dont
deserve

She turns and walks past him back towards the car

FRANK
Wait a minute

He stumbles after her Other cars whizz by but hes past
caring

FRANK (CONTD)
Wait a minute God damn it

She leans against the car and folds her arms

FRANK (CONTD)
You listen to me This is one time
youre not going to get away with
twisting everything I say

APRIL
Christ I wish youd stayed home
tonight

FRANK

You know what you are when youre
like this Youre sick I really
mean that Youre sick

APRIL
And you know what you are
(eyes raking him)
Youre disgusting

FRANK
Oh yeah

APRIL
Just because youve got me safely

can bully me into feeling whatever
you want

moment

FRANK
You in a trap You in a trap
Jesus dont make me laugh

APRIL

Yes me
(clutching at her chest)

Me Me Me Oh you poor pathetic
little boy Look at you Look at
you and tell me how by any stretch
of the imagination you can call
yourself a man

He raises his fist she flinches away and BONG BONG BONG
BONG He punches the hood of the car Then silence The
look April gives him is probably the worst look hes ever
received a look of pitying boredom
FRANK
Dont look at me like that April
APRIL
Could we please go home now
She calmly walks around and gets in the car After a

Frank follows

INT FRANK AND APRILS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Frank steps out of the bathroom April turns from the mirror
wearing the silk negligee and comes towards him with two
glasses

APRIL
Frank I have had the most
wonderful idea Ive been thinking
about it all day

FRANK
Whats all this about

APRIL
You know how much money we have
saved

She hands Frank a glass of brandy

APRIL (CONTD)
Enough to live on for six months
without you earning another dime
And with the money we could get
from the house and the car longer
than that

FRANK
What we get for the houseWhat
are you talking about Where are
we going to live

APRIL
Paris

Frank stares

APRIL (CONTD)
You always said it was the only
place youd ever been that was
worth living So why dont we go
there

FRANK
Youre serious

APRIL
Yes Whats stopping us

FRANK
Whats stopping us Well I can
think of a lot of things For
instance what kind of a job could
I possibly get

APRIL
You wont be getting any kind of
job because I will

Frank laughs

Oh right

APRIL
Dont laugh -- listen a minute
Have you any idea what they pay for
secretarial positions in the
government agencies in Europe
Embassies and those things

Frank laughs again

FRANK
No I dont

APRIL
Im serious about this Frank Do
you think Im kidding or something

FRANK
No I know I know I just have a
couple of questions is all For
one thing do you mind telling me
what exactly Im supposed to be
doing while youre out earning all
this money

She draws back shocked that he doesnt get it
APRIL
Dont you see thats the whole
idea Youll be doing what you
shouldve been allowed to do seven
years ago Youll have time
Frank Youll have time to find
out what it is that you actually
want to do and when you figure it
out youll have the time and the
freedom to start doing it

FRANK
Sweetheart its just not very
realistic is all

APRIL
Well I happen to think this is
unrealistic I think its
unrealistic for a man with a fine
mind to go on working like a dog
year after year at a job he cant
stand coming home to a place he
cant stand to a wife whos
equally unable to stand the same
things

Frank is silent How could anyone possibly argue with her

APRIL (CONTD)
You want to know the worst part
Our whole existence here is based
on this great premise that were
somehow very special and superior
to the whole thing and you know
what Ive realized Were not
Were just like everyone else
Look at us Weve bought into the
same ridiculous delusion This
idea that you have to resign from
life and settle down the moment you
have children And weve been
punishing each other for it

FRANK

Listen we decided to move out
here No one ever forced me to
take the job at Knox

(MORE)

FRANK (CONTD)
I mean who ever said I was supposed
to be a big deal anyway

APRIL
When I first met you there was
nothing in the world you couldnt
do or be

FRANK
I was a little wise guy with a big
mouth thats all

APRIL
You were not How can you even say
that

FRANK
-All right So Ill have

time And God knows thats
appealing Its very appealing
And I mean everything you say
might make a certain amount of
sense if I had some definite
talent maybe If I were an artist
or a writer

APRIL
But Frank listen to me Its what
you are thats being stifled here
Its what you are thats being
denied and denied and denied in
this kind of life

FRANK
And whats that

APRIL
Dont you know

He looks at her She gazes back at him

APRIL (CONTD)
Youre the most valuable and
wonderful thing in the world
Youre a man

Frank looks at her In that moment he loves her more than
ever before He kisses her
APRIL (CONTD)

our one chance

package

He opens it his face slowly registering what it means

APRIL
Why not I dont need everything

moved out here was because I got
pregnant Then we had another
child to prove the first one wasnt
a mistake I mean how long does it

Frank turns towards her

FRANK
All I know is what I feel And
anyone else in their right mind
would feel the same way

APRIL
(quiet)
But Ive had two children Doesnt

FRANK
Christ The fact that you even put
it that way You make it sound
like having children is a
punishment

APRIL
I love my children

FRANK

APRIL
What the hell is that supposed to
mean

FRANK

April you just said our daughter
was mistake How do I know you

FRANK

sane mother doesnt buy herself a
piece of rubber tubing to give
herself an abortion so she can go

Aprils face

FRANK (CONTD)
(sober)
All Im saying is you dont seem
entirely rational about this
thing And maybe we should get
someone to help you think about it

APRIL
And the new jobs going to pay
for that too

FRANK
April if you need a shrink itll
be paid for Obviously
April turns to the book shelves Her back to him

Frank waits his heart beating quickly

APRIL
Okay I guess there isnt much
more to say then is there

Her eyes are bright with tears
APRIL (CONTD)

So I guess Paris was a pretty
childish idea huh

April closes her eyes Tears run down her cheeks He walks

over to her but he doesnt touch her

FRANK (CONTD)

INT VITOS LOG CABIN - NIGHT

Two drumsticks spinning in a spotlight They click out a
rhythm and crash into a number

Cut back to reveal a small low-ceilinged joint On-stage

are the Steve Kovack quartet four perspiring middle-aged
men

with day jobs

YOUNGISH COUPLES and the odd middle-aged COUPLE navigate
the
dance floor

A smattering of lost SINGLES line the bar

The Wheelers and Campbells sit squashed into a booth on the
side of the dance floor

Several empty glasses have accumulated Milly is beating the
edge of the table with red drink straws Shes a few drinks
ahead

They have to SHOUT over the MUSIC

MILLY
Oh sure Give us girls a couple
of days and we can get over

Frank turns his attention to Milly Hes a good dancer His
movements are fast and aggressive his mind on April

Milly is a little too drunk and hurries to keep up
perspiring through her dress He spins her around and
around back and forth into his arms Milly begins to look
slightly dizzy

MILLY (CONTD)
Frank

He doesnt hear her over the music or he doesnt care

rushes for the ladys room

Shep sips his beer trying to figure out how to connect with
her

SHEP
You just wanted out huh

APRIL

Shep nods not entirely sure what she means

APRIL (CONTD)
For years I thought we shared a
secretthat we would be wonderful
in the world I didnt exactly know
how but just the
possibilitykept me hoping

She takes a long slug of her drink

APRIL (CONTD)
How pathetic is that To put all
your hopes in a promise that was
never made See Frank knowshe

place Hes just fine Married two
kids It should be enough It is
for him Hes right we were never
special or destined or anything at

joined hands allow and does a little twitching hip-bobbing
curtsies before twisting back all seemingly effortless It
is joyous released

INT SHEPS CAR - NIGHT

Shep slips behind the wheel and is immediately kissing her
groping

SHEP
Let me take you somewhere

APRIL

She

No Please Here Now In the
back seat

She climbs into the back seat He pulls off his jacket and
climbs in after her He folds the jacket under her head for
a pillow

She remains perfectly still allowing him to kiss her to
search under her clothing to kiss her skin and finally to
lift her skirt and pull her clothing aside and make love to
her against the vinyl seat cover

As suddenly as it began its over Shep collapses against
her April stares into the darkness

SHEP (CONTD)

April This is what Ive always
wanted I love you
APRIL

Dont say that

SHEP
I mean it I love you

APRIL

Please just be quiet for a minute

They begin to quietly assemble themselves

INT FRANK AND APRILS BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Frank stands at the mirror putting on a clean shirt

INT WHEELER KITCHENDINING ROOM - AFTERNOON

April stands at the kitchen table chopping vegetables
wears an unflattering floral dress

Frank stands in the doorway watching

FRANK
Its beautiful out

APRIL
Yes its lovely

He glances at the calendar

FRANK
You know what today is

She doesnt look at him

FRANK (CONTD)
Its twelve weeks

APRIL
Thats right

He walks over to her He takes her in his arms

stiffens

FRANK
Look this has been kind of a crazy
summer Weve both been under a
strain I mean I know youre
upset

APRIL
You know Im not sleeping with you
and you want to know why

She looks him straight in the eye

APRIL (CONTD)
Well Im sorry Frank but I dont
really feel like talking about it

She pulls herself free of his grasp He watches as she adds

the vegetables in the pot on the stove

FRANK
Okay What do you feel like
talking about

APRIL
Would it be all right if we didnt
talk about anything Cant we just
take each day as it comes and do
the best we can and not feel we

She
have to talk about everything all
the time

He smiles patiently

FRANK
I dont think I suggested we talk
about everything all the time My
point was weve both been under a
strain and we ought to be trying to
help each other as much as we can
right now

Shes utterly uninterested and its making him nervous

FRANK (CONTD)
I mean God knows my own behavior
has been pretty weird lately I
mean as it happens there is
actually something Id like to tell
you about

She continues folding the napkins

FRANK (CONTD)
Ive been with a girl in the city a
few times

Finally she stops moving She looks at him

FRANK (CONTD)

A girl I hardly even know It was
nothing to me but she got a little
carried away Shes just a kid
Anyway its over now Its really
over If I werent sure of that I
guess I could never have told you
about it

APRIL
Why did you

FRANK
(relieved)
Baby I dont know I think it was
a simple case of wanting to be a
man again after all that abortion
business Some kind of neurotic
irrational need to prove something

APRIL
No I dont mean why did you have
the girl I mean why did you tell
me about it

He is suddenly unsure

APRIL (CONTD)
I mean whats the point Is it
supposed to make me jealous or
something Is it supposed to make
me fall in love with you or back
into bed with you or what I mean
what am I supposed to say

He tries that same patient smile but its not convincing

FRANK
Why dont you say what you feel

APRIL
I dont feel anything

FRANK
In other words you dont care what
I do or who I fuck or anything

APRIL
No I guess thats right I dont

She is frighteningly calm

APRIL (CONTD)
Fuck who you like

His panic mounts

FRANK
Dont you seeDont you see I
want you to care

APRIL
Oh I know you do And I suppose I
would if I loved you But you see
I dont think I do anymore And I
only just figured that out And
thats why Id just as soon not do
any talking right now

She goes back into the kitchen Frank follows her

reason

John paces the room with his hands behind his back like a
detective at a murder scene

JOHN (CONTD)
But its hardly ever the real
reason Whats the real reason

Shep stands at a coffee machine gathering himself He looks
up He begins to feed coins into the machine His hands are
trembling He drops a coin It rolls under the machine He
has to get down on his hands and knees to retrieve it

INT HOSPITAL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

Shep walks tentatively holding a cup in each hand slopping
coffee onto the floor

He rounds the corner and stops

Frank is no longer in his chair at the end of the long
echoing hallway Shep looks around

Then suddenly the double doors are flung open and a number
of nurses hurry out Behind them comes Frank supported by
two Doctors

Shep runs to them as they move Frank over to a chair

in shock
FRANK
No No No

They try to make him sit but he stays stubbornly on his
feet the chair skidding behind him

DOCTOR
Try to sit down Mr Wheeler

SHEP
Sit down Frank

Frank looks at Shep - his face is a terrifying blank

EXT REVOLUTIONARY ROAD - MAGIC HOUR

A toyland of white and pastel houses along the road The
crisp green lawns The blue televisions flickering behind
the glass

We hear the WHISK of running footsteps on the asphalt the
rush of a mans breath

Frank is running down the middle of the street tears
streaming silently down his face

INT CAMPBELL LIVING ROOM - EVENING ONE YEAR LATER
Four high-ball glasses with glistening cubes of ice
Shep puts the finishing touches on four drinks

MR and MRS BRACE a pleasant looking young couple fresh
from the city sit on the couch

MILLY

my life Such wonderful people
Werent they Shep Poor April

Shep picks up the drinks and carries them across the room
He stands there beside the three of them but he cant bring
himself to sit down and join in

MILLY (CONTD)

Shep nods

MILLY (CONTD)

Shep turns and walks out of the room

EXT CAMPBELL HOUSE - EVENING

Shep walks across the lawn to the edge of the property He
looks out over the suburban houses At what was once the
Wheeler house

Sheps face looking out His eyes are filled with tears
Milly comes up behind him

MILLY

She takes his arm and holds him close
SHEP (CONTD)

Wheelers any more
Other

MILLY

Shep and Milly look out over Revolutionary Road

EXT CITY PARK - DAY

The same silence over a beautiful day in the city And
from the silence the faint sound of wind through the leafy
branches of trees

Two children play in a playground in a small park

Its Jennifer and Michael They seem happy engrossed

kids play around them

Watching them from a bench is Frank He is a little older
little thinner
Close on Franks face The SOUND of his children playing

INT GIVINGS LIVING ROOM - DAY

Mrs Givings crouches on a cotton work sheet painting
onto a chair Mr Givings sits reading the paper

A new puppy sleeps curled up on the rug nearby

MRS GIVINGS
I cant tell you how pleased I am
about the little Revolutionary Road
place Howard Remember how dreary
it looked all winter All cold and
dark and -- well spooky Creepy-
crawly And now whenever I drive
past it gives me such a lift to
see it all perked up and spanking
clean again with lights in the
windows And do you know I was
just thinking Ive loved that
little house for years and the
Braces are the first really
suitable people Ive ever found for
it Really nice congenial people
I mean

Mr Givings fiddles with his hearing aid

MR GIVINGS
Well except for the Wheelers you
mean

MRS GIVINGS
Oh I was very fond of the Wheelers
but they always were a bit -- a bit
whimsical for my taste A bit
neurotic I may not have stressed
it but they were often very trying
people to deal with in many ways

(MORE)

MRS GIVINGS (CONTD)
Actually the main reason the
little house has been so hard to
sell is that they let it depreciate
so dreadfully Warped window
frames wet cellar crayon marks on
the walls filthy smudges around
all the--

Mr Givings reaches up to his ear and SUDDENLY SILENCE
but for the faint sound of wind

He gazes out the window as behind him Mrs Givings continues
to talk but we cant hear a thing

He has turned off his hearing aid
