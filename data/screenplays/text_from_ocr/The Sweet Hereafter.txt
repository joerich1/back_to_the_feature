gets out of his car and knocks on the door

WANDA OTTO answers She has been crying The two stare at
each other

MITCHELL
Mrs Otto my name is Mitchell
Stephens The Walkers told me you
might be willing to talk to me

Pause

MITCHELL (CONTD)
Im sorry for coming over
unannounced like this Mrs Otto
but the Walkers said you would
understand I know its an awful
time but its important that we

talk

WANDA
Who are you

MITCHELL
Im a lawyer

WANDA

You cant come here

MITCHELL
Please let me explain Ill only
take a moment of your time
WANDA
No

MITCHELL
Please

WANDA pauses stares at MITCHELL then lets him in
CUT TO
INT THE OTTOS HOUSE -- DAY

MITCHELL walks into the OTTO residence It is a large two-
storey space divided into several smaller chambers with
sheets of brightly colored cloth - tie-dyes and Indian
madras - that hang from wires

On a low brick platform in the centre of the main chamber is
a large wood-burning stove A few feet from the stove
sitting on an overstuffed cushion is HARTLEY OTTO

HARTLEY is listening to music on his headphones He is very
stoned WANDA moves over and pulls the headphones off her
husbands head

WANDA
We have a guest What did you say
your name was

MITCHELL

Mitchell Stephens

MITCHELL hands them a card HARTLEY reads it with
deliberation

WANDA
The Walkers sent him by

HARTLEY rises up He stares at MITCHELL A tense pause

HARTLEY
You want a cup of tea or something

MITCHELL
A cup of tea would be nice
(beat)
Would it be alright if I sit down
for a few minutes Mrs Otto I
want to talk to you

WANDA stares at MITCHELL No response MITCHELL waits a
beat then seats himself rather uncomfortably on a large

pillow He is unsure whether to cross his legs or fold

them under his chin

MITCHELL (CONTD)
The Walkers spoke very highly of
you

WANDA
Youve been retained

MITCHELL
Yes

WANDA
Their child died and they got a
lawyer

Pause MITCHELL assesses WANDAS energy

MITCHELL
It should be said that my task is to
represent the Walkers only in their
anger Not their grief

WANDA
Who did they get for that

MITCHELL
You are angry arent you Mrs
Otto Thats why Im here To give
your anger a voice To be your

weapon against whoever caused that
bus to go off the road

WANDA
Dolores

MITCHELL
Its my belief that Dolores was
doing exactly what shed been doing
for years Besides the school
boards insurance on Dolores is
minimal A few million at the very
most The really deep pockets are
to be found in the town or in the
company that made the bus

WANDA
You think someone else caused the
accident

MITCHELL

Mrs Otto there is no such thing
as an accident The word doesnt
mean anything to me As far as Im
concerned somebody somewhere made a
decision to cut a corner Some
corrupt agency or corporation
accounted the cost variance between
a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar
out-of-court settlement They
decided to sacrifice a few lives for
the difference Thats whats done
Mrs Otto Ive seen it happen so
many times before

HARTLEY returns with the tea

HARTLEY
But Dolores said she saw a dog and
tried to

MITCHELL

How long has Dolores been driving
that bus Mr Otto How many times
has she steered clear of danger
What went wrong that morning

MITCHELL takes the cup of tea

MITCHELL (CONTD)
Someone calculated ahead of time
what it would cost to sacrifice
safety Its the darkest most
cynical thing to imagine but its
Pause

Pause

absolutely true And now its up
to me to make them build that bus
with an extra bolt or add an extra
yard of guard rail Its the only
way we can ensure moral
responsibility in this society By
what I do

WANDA
So youre just the thing we need

MITCHELL
Excuse me

WANDA
Isnt that what you want us to
believe That were completely
defenseless That you know whats
best

MITCHELL
Listen to me Mrs Otto Listen very
carefully I do know whats best

As were sitting here the town or
the school board or the manufacturer
of that bus are lining up a battery
of their own lawyers to negotiate
with people as grief-stricken as
yourselves And this makes me very
very mad Its why I came all the
way up here If everyone had done
their job with integrity your son
would be alive this morning and
safely in school I promise you
that I will pursue and reveal who it
was that did not do their job

MITCHELL
Who is responsible for this tragedy
Then in your name and the Walkers
name and the name of whoever decides
to join us I shall sue TI shall
sue for negligence until they bleed

WANDA
I want that person to go to jail
For the rest of his life I want
him to die there I dont want his
money

MITCHELL nods sympathetically

MITCHELL
Its unlikely that anyone will go to
prison Mrs Otto But he or his
company will pay in other ways And
we must make them pay Not for the

money or to compensate you for the
loss of your son That cant be
done But to protect other innocent
children You see Im not just
here to speak for your anger but
for the future as well

(beat)
What were talking about is an
ongoing relationship to time

Pause HARTLEY looks at MITCHELLS teacup

HARTLEY
I didnt ask if you wanted milk

MITCHELL
No A little sugar though

HARTLEY
Weve only got honey

MITCHELL
Tlltake it straight

MITCHELL maintains his eye contact with WANDA

WANDA
Are you expensive

MITCHELL
No
MITCHELL
If you agree to have me represent
you in this suit I will require no
payment until after the case is won
when I will require one third of the
awarded amount If there is no
award made then my services will
cost you nothing Its a standard
agreement

WANDA
Do you have this agreement with you

MITCHELL
ts in my car

MITCHELL gets up

MITCHELL (CONTD)
ll just be a minute Anyhow you
should discuss this all without me
before you make any decision

The Pied Piper of Hamelin
By famous Hanover city
The river Weser deep and wide
Washes its wall on the southern
side
A pleasanter spot you never spied
But when begins my ditty

MASON
Whats a ditty again

NICOLE
Its like a song

MASON
Oh

NICOLE
NICOLE

When begins my ditty

Almost five hundred years ago
To see the townsfolk suffer so
From vermin was a pity

MASON
Whats vermin again

NICOLE
Rats
They fought the dogs and killed the
cats
And bit the babies in the cradles
And ate the cheeses out of vats
And licked the soup from the cooks
own ladles
Split open the kegs of salted
sprats
Made nests inside mens Sunday hats
And even spoiled the womens chats
By drowning their speaking
With shrieking and squeaking
In fifty different sharps and
flats

MASON
Nicole

NICOLE
Yes

MASON

Can I sit beside you on the bus
tomorrow

NICOLE
Dont you usually like to sit at the
back To wave at your Dad

MASON

MASON

Did the Pied Piper take the children
away because he was mad that the
town didnt pay him

NICOLE
Thats right

MASON
Well if he knew magic - if he could
get the kids into the mountain - why
couldnt he use his pipe to make the
people pay him for getting rid of
the rats

NICOLE
Becausehe wanted to them to be
punished

MASON

The people in the town

NICOLE
Yes

out as well The two walk towards the barn

NICOLE

(voice over)
Once more he stept into the street
And to his lips again
Laid his long pipe of smooth
straight cane
And ere he blew three notes
such sweet soft notes as yet
musicians cunning
Never gave the enraptured air -
There was a rustling seemed like a
bustling
Of merry crowds justling at pitching
and hustling
Small feet were pattering wooden
shoes clattering
Little hands clapping and little
tongues chattering

And like fowls in a farm-yard when
the barley is scattering

Out came the children running

All the little boys and girls
With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls
And sparkling eyes and teeth like
pearls

Tripping and skipping ran merrily
after

The wonderful music with shouting
and laughter

Inside the barn SAM and NICOLE are engaged in a sexual
embrace The camera glides past them as NICOLEs voice
continues to read from the poem

NICOLE (CONTD)
(voice over)
When lo as they reached the
mountain-side
A wondrous portal opened wide
As if a cavern was suddenly
hollowed
And the Piper advanced and the
children followed
And when all were in to the very
last
The door in the mountain-side shut
fast

And could not dance the whole of
the way
And in after years if you would
blame
His sadness he was used to say-
Its dull in the town since my

playmates left

I cant forget that Im bereft

Of all the pleasant sights they see
Which the Piper also promised me
For me led us he said to a joyous
land

Joining the town and just at hand
Where waters gushed and fruit-trees
grew

And flowers put forth a fairer hue
And everything was strange and
new

On this last line NICOLEs lips begin to move as she
repeats the line out loud to herself

I didnt know I was in a panic
guessed shed been bitten by an

away and Zoe was continuing to
swell Klara took her in her arms

and tried to breast-feed her

while

I dialed the hospital I finally

got a doctor on the line He

sounded young but cool He was

confident but there was a

nervousness He have been an

ever had to deal with anything like
this He wanted to seem like he
knew what he was doing but he was

just as scared as I was

babies or else with Zoes body

weight shed be dead He told me I
had to rush her to the hospital He
was alone There was no ambulance
available Now you listen he
said Theres a good chance you can
get her to me before her throat
closes but the important thing is
to keep her calm He asked if
there was one of us she was more
relaxed with than the other I
said Yes with me

with fear and her fear was
contagious I was a better actor
than she was thats all Zoe loved
us equally then Just like she
hates us both equally now

(beat)
The doctor told me that I should
hold her in my lap and let Klara
drive to the hospital He asked me
to bring a small sharp knife It
had to be clean There was no time
to sterilize properly He explained
how to perform an emergency
tracheotomy How to cut into my
daughters throat and windpipe
without causing her to bleed to
death He told me thered be a lot
of blood I said I didnt think I
could do it If her throat closes
up and stops her breathing youll
have to Mr Stephens Youll have
a minute and a half two minutes
maybe and shell probably be
unconscious when you do it But if
you can keep her calm and relaxed
if you dont let her little heart
beat too fast and spread the poison
around then you might just make it
over here first You get going

Whats that Dolores

DOLORES
I told you that I was doing fifty
miles an hour when the accident
happened Thats how I remembered
it But the truth is I might have
been doing sixty Or sixty five
And if thats true that I was over
the limit when the bus went over
what would happen then

MITCHELL
That would complicate things

DOLORES
Because Id be to blame right

MITCHELL
Billy Ansel will insist that you
were driving fifty-one miles an
hour Just like youve done every
morning for the past fifteen years

He knows that Billy

MITCHELL
Yes He does

Mrs Driscoll if Billy Ansel does
not volunteer to say so in court I
will subpoena him and oblige him to
testify to that effect

But in order to do that you must
let me bring a suit in your name

charging negligent infliction of
emotional harm Thats what Im now
asking you to consider

Its clear to me and other people
that you have suffered significantly
from this event

his mouth purses his lips on the left side and emits a
string of broken syllables and sounds After this outburst
DOLORES looks at MITCHELL a comforted smile on her face

You heard what Abbott said

MITCHELL
Yes

DOLORES
Anything you didnt understand

MITCHELL
There might have been a word or two
that slipped by Maybe you could
clarify it for me just to be
absolutely sure

DOLORES

Abbott said that the true jury of a
persons peers is the people of her
town Only they the people who
have known her all her life and not
twelve strangers can decide her
guilt or innocence And if I have
committed a crime then its a crime
against them so they are the ones
who must decide my punishment

somewhat tawdry The BURNELLS are almost poor

But SAM then leads NICOLE into the special room he has built
for her It seems like another world Every detail has

make this room as attractive and inviting as possible

A room that a guilty abusive father might dream up for his
crippled daughter

SAM
What do you think

Pause NICOLE wheels around trying to control her emotions
as she inspects the room A phone rings in the background
MARY goes to answer it

NICOLE fixes her gaze at the back of the door

NICOLE

SAM
Partly But theres a lot the
insurance doesnt cover Thats one
of the reasons we have a lawyer To
make sure the insurance gets paid
and to help us look after the rest

NICOLE
How will he do that

SAM
Well Mr Stephens is representing
several families The Ottos the
Walkers us and I think a couple
more Mr Stephens is suing the
town for negligence Hes sure that
the accident could have been avoided
if they had done their jobs right
Hes a very smart man

NICOLE stares at her sister whos at the top of the tree

JENNY turns to look back at NICOLE

Theres a tension as it seems as though JENNY is going to

you and your mom and dad and some
other folks here in town Were
trying to generate some
compensation however meager for
what you have suffered and at the
same time see that an accident like
this never happens again Youre
central to the case Im trying to
build Nicole But youd probably
just as soon let the whole thing
lie Just get on with your life as
quickly and smoothly as possible

NICOLE nods Pause as MITCHELL waits for her to go on

I dont like thinking about the
accident I dont even remember it

happening Besides it just makes

You hate that

SAM
What she means Mitch

MITCHELL silences SAM with a gesture of his hand

MITCHELL

People cant help it you know

you in this wheelchair knowing what

time Daddy came back from the
washroom and Mom came in with her
tea and cookies you were going on
about how tough it would be for me
to answer some of the questions
those other lawyers would ask

MITCHELL
They work for the people were
trying to sue Their job is to try
to minimize damages Our job
Nicole is to try to maximize them
You have to think of it that way
As people doing their jobs No good
guys or bad guys Just our side and
their side

to MITCHELL without looking up

stares at SAM as he argues with MITCHELL on the steps

(voice over)
Daddy took a long time I guess he
wanted to have a few words with you
He must have tried to tell you that
I was lying Then you would tell
Daddy that it didnt matter if I was
lying or not the lawsuit is dead

As NICOLES words are heard her point of view of SAM and
MITCHELL arguing is seen

The movement of their lips is in sync with NICOLES voice
over

NICOLE (CONTD)

(voice over)
Everyones lawsuit is dead Forget
it Tell the others to forget it
Its over Right now Sam the
thing youve got to worry about is
why she lied A kid whod do that
to her own father is not normal
