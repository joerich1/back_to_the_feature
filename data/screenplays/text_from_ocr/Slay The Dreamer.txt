SLAY THE DREAMER
FADE IN
INT CHURCH -- MEMPHIS TENNESSEE -- DAY -
The last rays of sunset stream through a large stained glass
window The resonant SOUNDS of the CHOIR are infused with an
unmistakable gospel spirit

The choir like the CONGREGATION is almost all black The
hymn reaches its rousing conclusion A distinguished looking
MINISTER mid-forties finishes his sermon

MINISTER
- yes we have been wounded The
forces of darkness have conspired
to turn what we fought for in the
50s and 60s justice dignity
compassion - into the shame and
poverty of the 1970s There are
some who say that we should give up
hope that we will never see the
blessed community we dreamt of
But remember - you cannot wait for
the Lord you must seek him So
too you cannot wait for justice
Dont give into despair Have the
courage to seek for in searching
you will find dignity and the light
of the Lord will be upon you

CONGREGATION
(in unison)
Amen

MINISTER
May your love of God Almighty give
you peace as you leave this place
and set out into the world

CONGREGATION
(in unison)
Amen

As the CHOIR begins the exit hymn (Marching to Zion) the
MINISTER moves down from the podium and begins to greet his
parishioners

EXT CHURCH RECTORY - —- NIGHT

A flood light illuminates the night Reverend Lawson emerges
carrying his homework

Hes intercepted by IONE TURNER two hundred pounds of love
She engulfs him with a hug

another pie from her paper bag

IONE

Reverend I was thinking maybe a
solo next Sunday

LAWSON
Brother Boxer has complete control
of solos But you never know

He makes his escape heading toward the parking lot laden
with desserts
IN THE SHADOWS

A FIGURE emerges and moves in the direction of the parking
lot Soft-soled shoes move silently across the pavement

ON LAWSONS VW BUG

The Minister puts his work into the car then stops He
senses a presence He turns around slowly his face
registers concern

rebuffed

INT COURTROOM - —- DAY

The JUDGE eyes Hiram as he returns sitting next to his
wealthy white client

JUDGE
Nice of you to rejoin us Mr Evans

LAWSON enters the courtroom and sits towards the back

EVANS
The matter is clear as a screen door
your honor The Tennessee code
annotated is explicit as to the
points weve presented We therefore
rest on the briefs submitted and ask
for a directed verdict

JUDGE
Mr Morgan

The Judge looks at CLAY MORGAN JR Morgan is a corporate
lawyer in his late thirties who talks Southern dresses
London and charms all the time Morgan gets up from behind
the defense table He knows that hes holding a busted
straight but still is compelled to strut

MORGAN
Thank you youre Honor I realize
my esteemed colleague has presented
a compelling case
BOOM Morgan turns to the origin of the sound

MORGANS POV

The rear doors to the courtroom SLAM shut Enter JEFFREY
JENKINS walking quickly holding a large legal volume

Jeffs hair is a little too long and his clothes reflect his
indifference to appearance or trends Jeff walks up to the
defense table and sets the book down

JEFF
(to Morgan sotto voce)
Ive got to show you something

ON MORGAN

MORGAN
Excuse me your honor
(irritated)
What

Morgan walks back to the defense table Jeff slides the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to him

ON LAWSON

(MORE)
From Lawsons distant POV Morgan appears to be assisting his
awkward junior associate

ON MORGAN AND JEFF
Morgans expression changes from irritated to inspired

MORGAN
Your Honor Please excuse my young
associate As I was saying our
research shows that the question of
jurisdiction enjoys precedence
(picks up the book)

Title 28 Section 1441a and Rule
81c of the federal rules of

JUDGE
Mr Morgan maybe yall havent
noticed but we are in a state
court The Federal Court is down
the block

LAUGHTER from the room Lawson watches intrigued

MORGAN

Good point Your Honor And thats
where this whole shebang oughta
be According to Title 28 we do
not require an order of this court
to remove this case to the United
States District Court That court
is as you noted just down the
block

(to Jeff)
MORGAN (CONTD)
Jeff why dont you pass that
Federal Rules book to Judge Harper

Jeff hands the book to the Bailiff who passes it to the
Judge The Judge quickly reads the passage to himself

JUDGE
Mr Evans this court no longer has
jurisdiction Next case

Lawson takes notice Evans confident demeanor has given way
to resignation Evans walks over to Morgan who is just
standing Evans offers his hand in congratulations

EVANS
Good job Clay You could steal
the flowers off a dead mans grave
See you in Federal Court

MOBRAY
Ready when you are counselor

Jeff watches Morgan bask in victory As Hiram turns to leave
he notices Lawson approaching the defense table Hiram winks
at Lawson then exits Lawson holds out his hand to Clay

LAWSON
Congratulations Mr Morgan Very
impressive

MORGAN
Thank you Reverend

LAWSON
You have a gift Be nice to see
that gift working to help the less
fortunate

Morgan puts his files in his briefcase Snaps it shut
looking for a graceful exit

matter A woman wrongfully
incarcerated

JEFF
Wrongful incarceration It sounds
pretty straightforward

Morgan is surprised that Jeff even knows about the case let
alone has an opinion

MORGAN
Nothings straightforward in the law
Jeffrey Didnt your distinguished
daddy tell you that If the state
took the time to put some old black
lady in the basket factory there
must be a damn good reason

JEFF
Maybe just look through the file

MORGAN
Its pro bono kid Gotta bill the
hours or hit the showers Branson
will never go for it But hell go
ahead Present it at the Partners
meeting Its all yours

Morgan retrieves another toy ball and shoots

MORGAN
(continuing)
He shoots he scores

BRANSON (VO)
You are to be commended Billing
for the quarter is outpacing the
same quarter 75 by ten percent

INT LAW FIRM CONFERENCE ROOM -- LATE THAT AFTERNOON

Start on WILLIAM BILL BRANSON a southern gentleman with a
sharks toothy smile Senior and Junior partners are seated
at the table while Associates sit behind them along the
wall Jeff is seated on the outer perimeter next to KATY
BOLTON an attractive poised twenty-six year old and the
only black face in the room Katy is taking notes on a
yellow pad

BRANSON
Lets keep the billing hours up
(a beat)

If theres nothing else Id like
to adjourn

ANGLE the room as Jeff slowly stands

JEFF
Uh Mr Branson I gave your
secretary a file on Grace Walden
She was not represented by an
attorney or examined by a
psychiatrist I was wondering if
you had a chance to look at it

BRANSON
Yes Jeffrey I read it
JEFF
Uh According to my preliminary

research there was no apparent
reason why she was placed in that
institution and is still there
eight years later

BRANSON
Were not talking fee here are we

JEFF
I believe she is indigent We were
contacted by her Minister

MORGAN
Where do we draw the line Jeff
Were in the business of billable
hours Were not storefront lawyers

A painful pause To everyones surprise Katy speaks up

KATY
A case like this could land us an
article in The Memphis Lawyer sir
It could actually bring in more
business The Reverend is quite
well known

JEFF
(grateful)
Yes yes Its James Lawson
Hes a friend of my fathers

MORGAN
In that event maybe I should take
a look

BRANSON

If I recall correctly Clay your
billing rate is somewhat higher
than Jeffs

(to Morgan)
This firm can afford ten hours for
better relations with the Negro
community

(to Katy)
Youll keep the editors of The
Memphis Lawyer informed of our
commitment and due to the nature
of the case maybe you should
assist Jeff on this one

EXT CORRIDOR - —- DAY

Jeff sidles up to Katy as the other lawyers exit and disperse

JEFF
(on the move)
Thanks Branson can be a little

unreceptive at times

KATY
Its a good case Its the kind of
thing we should do more of We
already have enough meters running
in this building

Clay moves past on his way to his office

JEFF
Listen Katy I was thinking
since were working together we
could stop by Bolivar State Hospital
on Saturday and see Miz Walden

Clay looks on amused by Jeffs apparent awkwardness

JEFF
(continuing)
Then if its okay with you we
could swing by and enjoy some of my
Dads stringy barbecue Hes
cooking Its kinda informal

KATY
Go to your fathers for dinner

Clay has paused in his doorway to watch grins

CLAY
He shoots He scores

INT INSTITUTION -- JEFFS POV

Dim lighting high ceilings peeling paint stone floors
narrow wooden benches - spare forms and haunting shadows
abound Silence and echoes including JEFFS OWN FOOTSTEPS
striking the stone as he walks now tentatively into

THE LOBBY

JEFF stops and becomes aware of another SOUND the CLICKING of a
WOODEN TOY in the hands of a solitary inmate seated on a bench

The inmate is BRIAN GREENE between 40 and 60 dressed in an
institutional cotton bathrobe His eyes are unfocused

Jeff continues on to the empty Reception Window and
Information Desk His mood is darkening his breathing
reacting to the heavy antiseptic smell of the place

CLOSE-UP on an old yellowing index card taped to the window

CARD
IMPORTANT NOTICE GRACE WALDEN IS
TO RECEIVE NO VISITORS AND NO
TELEPHONE CALLS JUNE 6 1968

Jeff studies the note Then reaches through an opening in
the glass partition picks up a Visitors Pass and puts it
on his lapel He turns and approaches the inmate on the
bench and offers his hand

JEFF

GRACE WALDEN is seated on the bed dressed in a robe pajamas

at least twenty years older She has no teeth wears no

GRACE
Cant be sure anymore What with

She shakes her head no her eyes unfocused

INT THE CORRIDOR

Suddenly the Guards brace Jeff and rip his tape recorder
away

TRENT

Jeff pretends a meek compliance then with a fast pivot he
grabs back the recorder leaps clear of the Guards and runs
Jeff sprints full speed down the corridor past Brian Greene
and toward the main doors

EXT HOSPITAL

Bucolic Birds CHIRPING Jeffs yellow TR3 is parked not
far from the main building Katy sits in the drivers seat

He leaps down a set of stairs and rushes toward the car

KATY

Earl and Trent in pursuit Jeff yanks open the door

JEFF

As Katy drives onto the highway Jeff removes the tape from
the recorder and hides it in her purse He takes a blank
tape from the glove compartment and puts it into the
recorder He puts the recorder on the dash in plain sight A
SIREN announces the Guards pursuit Katy sees the POLICE CAR
in the rearview mirror

KATY
(continuing)
What the helld you do back there

JEFF

The car pulls over The Guards approach guns drawn

TRENT
Out of the car both of you

JEFF
Yes sir But can I ask one
question first Officer Do you
work for the state police

EARL
Special Officer

JEFF
What does that mean Special
Officer You sure it doesnt mean
Hospital Security
(Trent hesitates)

JEFF (CONTD)
Cause if it does I believe your
jurisdiction extends just as far as
the hospital grounds -- and no
farther -- right Trust me on
this If you pull us out of this
car its technically a kidnapping
cause you got zero authority here
on this highway

Katy looks with admiration She sees a new Jeff

JEFF
(continuing)
Now unless you want her to drive
right over those shiny brogans I
suggest you step back officer
cause were going now

The Guards step back slowly in apparent defeat But then
Earl suddenly reaches into the car and grabs the tape
recorder off the dash

Jeff stares as the two Guards hurry away get into their
vehicle and drive off Now the highway is empty Katy
reaches into her purse and withdraws the tape

KATY
What the hell is on this thing

JEFF
I dont know gibberish

But who the hell is Grace Walden

dimension to Gregorys narrative

GREGORY
(continuing)
Exactly one month before the
assassination J Edgar Hoover
wired every FBI office Prevent
the rise of a black Messiah

Washington DC was Jerusalem to

Martin Luther King - and to John
Edgar Hoover

The lights go up The lean intense Gregory preaches and

teaches to the hushed audience

GREGORY
(continuing)
Martin King was assassinated
because he was a dreamer a drum
major for all peoples Human

Rights And those responsible for

his death didnt just kill the

dreamer - they wanted to kill the

dream We have to press for the
truth We have to relight the

flame Sign the petition We can
force the Congress to investigate

Dr Kings murder

points to his innocence

Jeff appears confused Pre-lap SOUNDS of running feet
FLASHBACK
EXT ROOMING HOUSE - APRIL 4 1968 - 602 PM

Start on running feet A shadowy figure emerges from the side
entrance of the rooming house In his right hand he carries
a rifle wrapped in a blanket The figure turns left onto Main
Street drops the package in plain view and runs on

GREGORY (VO)
Assume Ray did carefully plot the
killing why in hell would he drop
the gun with his fingerprints on it
right outside the rooming house

CUT BACK TO
INT CORRIDOR - PRESENT

GREGORY

plant Im surprised nobody watered

LAWSON
Unfortunately sometimes power
concedes nothing without demand

KATY
Youre preaching to the wrong
sister Reverend I lost my father
to talk like that

She moves deeper into the room

KATY

(continuing)
Praying has kept my family on their
knees for a long time

(a beat)
Up until a couple of hours ago I
had the opportunity to maybe one
day effect change from within the
system You can run around trying
to beat the doors down from the
outside and all you do is make a
lot of noise Insiders can open
those doors
LAWSON
True But What does it profit a
man if he gains the whole world
and loses his soul Mark Eight

A man cant ride your back if
youre standing up straight
»-Martin Luther King April 15

Jeff comes down the stairs two at a time

JEFF
Hey I found something
(sees Katy)
Katy good youre here Look at
this The slug that the Coroner
removed from the body was in one
piece

Holds up a picture of the autopsy photo

JEFF
(continuing)
The Coroner confirms it But the
slug that the FBI Lab used for a
ballistics test was in three pieces
That means theres a massive break in
the chain of evidence

KATY
Dont jump to conclusions

JEFF
Whos jumping The FBI tried to
match the rifle that was found in
front of the rooming house to the
death slug There was no match
Katy they cant prove that the gun
with Rays fingerprints on it is the
murder weapon

He looks at Katy then Lawson Theyre not with him

This is big You two seem
underwhelmed Did I miss
something

EXT CHURCH - - NIGHT

If they can kick Sprague out if
they can burn files and turn down
subpoenas the whole thing will
just be a puppet show The FBI

tragedys just going to be
repeated

Lawson is moved by Jeffs transformation

LAWSON
I pray Ive done the right thing

JEFF

that part -- from Genesis you had
me read You know -- And when

Lawson turns away not wanting to recall the prophetic images
of the story of Joseph

JEFF
(continuing)
You know it

LAWSON
And when they saw him far off
even before he came near they
conspired to slay him And they
said one to another Behold this
dreamer Come now and let us slay
him and cast him into the pit and
we will say some evil beast has
devoured him and we shall see what
will become of his dreams

Jeff looks at Lawson who gazes off at the empty steps leading

Reporters with tape recorders and a number of Print Media
Reporters They SHOUT and CACKLE as if it were a hanging

JEFF AND LAWSON

by the reporters who question them belligerently Lawson and
Jeff struggle up the steps without responding to the
questions and taunts Their path is blocked by the turmoil
of Reporters who jostle for position overlapping each other

1ST REPORTER

Lawson turn mount the final steps and enter the House
Office Building

THEME RISING -- BEGIN CRAWL

The House Select Committee on Assassinations met from January
to June of 1978 and interviewed 4924 witnesses

The Committee found that There was no evidence of complicity
of the FBI CIA or any Government Agency in the assassination
of Dr King

The Committee then sealed for fifty years all the
investigative files

The Congress called upon the Department of Justice to conduct
a thorough investigation into the crime and to inform the
American people of its findings

The Department of Justice has to this date done nothing
CRAWL ENDS - SCREEN IS BLACK
From out of the BLACK SCREEN a voice emerges then a face
It is Martin Luther King delivering the now famous
Montgomery Alabama speech (STOCK)
MARTIN LUTHER KING
How long Not long Because no
lie can live forever How long

Not long Because truth crushed to
earth will rise again

The image FREEZES and slowly dissolves

THE END
