OVER BLACK

Chess holds its master in its bonds shackling the mind
such that the inner freedom of the very strongest must
suffer - ALBERT EINSTEIN

EXT GRANITE COUNTRY HOUSE - ICELAND - DAWN

In the grey dawn a formidable house in the Icelandic
wilderness A single light burns in an upper window

Caption Reykjavik Iceland 415am July 20th 1972
In the distance a POLICE CAR approaches lights flashing
INT GRANITE COUNTRY HOUSE - ICELAND

CLOSE on a hand gripping the padded arm of an armchair The
index finger of the hand is PICKING at a thread

The HAND belongs to an intense young man with black hair
swept back He sits motionless peering at a chess game
which is a few moves old The man is BOBBY FISCHER

A SINGLE FLY begins to buzz against the window

Bobby eyes the fly The movement of his eyes is immense
Murderous The thread he has been picking at suddenly TEARS
with a THUNDEROUS RIPPING SOUND

The fly is trying to get out the window

BOBBYS PERCEPTION

The BUZZING of the fly is a howling hurricane from hell
BACK TO AN OBJECTIVE VIEW OF THE ROOM

Silence

Bobby stalks the fly -- CRUSHING IT with a coffee cup

He sits back down in a business-like way and stares at the
board again his fingernail beginning to work another thread

HEADLIGHTS sweep the room and we HEAR a car door SLAM
Bobbys face betrays no reaction -- but his whole hand CLAWS
the arm of the chair like an animal in a trap

At the SOUND of someone running upstairs he glances from
the chessboard to the door as a knock comes on the door

BOBBYS PERCEPTION

Someone is POUNDING on the door -- it SOUNDS like the Gestapo
in an old war movie

BACK TO AN OBJECTIVE VIEW
The knock on the door is polite

Bobby grips the armchair cant stand the noise that only he
can hear -- and he gets to his feet UPENDING a lamp

Another knock

Bobby pinballs around like the fly trying to escape --
breaking shutters as he tries to close them tripping over a
table ANOTHER KNOCK even louder

Then just as suddenly his eyes FOCUS on the chess board

A new light comes into his eyes as he stares at it -- and
his breathing begins to slow

ALL SOUND BEGINS TO FADE

As he moves toward the board -- his fingers reaching out --
in ultra slo-mo -- to makeasinglemove

BACK TO THE SCENE

Bobby closes his eyes Content He has solved the puzzle
CAPTION This is the true story of Bobby Fischer

The door opens A guy stands there -- mid-40s pugnacious
This is MARSHALL He stares at the debris of the room And
at Bobby who appears perfectly calm

BOBBY
There was a fly Its dead now

A huge agenda between the two men Marshall composes himself

MARSHALL
(quoting)
Never before in human history has
the outcome of an entire global war
of ideas rested on the shoulders of
one man

The slightest smile begins to form on Bobbys lips

MARSHALL (CONTD)
Im quoting the President of the
United States He was talking about
you Tome The President of the
United States talking to me He
called three times Three

Marshall lifts the receiver places a phone back on the hook

MARSHALL (CONTD)
Hes been trying to reach you

Bobby refuses to be intimidated If anything his smile
widens Marshall rights an upturned chair

MARSHALL (CONTD)
In Moscow Brezhnev opened his only
bottle of 1868 Louis Roederer Left
over from the revolution You know
why
(hammering it home)
Because He Heard You Quit

Bobby walks to the window looks out at the half-light

MARSHALL (CONTD)

There are boys your age in Vietnam
giving their lives right now in the
fight against Communism And all
you have to do is win a game of chess

(plaintively)
--Say something Bobby please
Bobby

Bobby doesnt answer Instead he stares out into the night
and we HEAR another voice

JOAN (VO)
-Bobby

is packed with Bohos Eastern European emigres NY
intellectuals A banner reads Brooklyn-Bed Sty American
Communist Party PARTY Coltrane wails on the record player

BOBBY IS INVISIBLE IN THIS ADULT WORLD

Adults LOOM above him laughing A MIXED COUPLE making out
open-mouthed A man smoking reefer smiles beatifically He
pauses to scribble chess notations in his little notebook

unspoken in his regard -- but also somehow thwarted

BALDING MAN
I hear you like chess
Yellow Revision 10-11-13 6

BOBBY
Yeah

He looks around takes a five dollar bill from his pocket
BALDING MAN

Bobbys eyes widen as he stares at the bill The man reaches
out to HUG him but Bobby shrinks away Uncle Paul frowns
settles for patting Bobby on the head and then walks away
10 IN THE LIVING ROOM

A heated discussion of Zionism the Rosenbergs Bobby wanders
past looks out the window The DARK SEDAN is still there

Yellow Revision 10-11-13

REGINA
Honey its okay--

BOBBY
But you told me--

REGINA
Bobby you remember what I said about
not letting them intimidate us
Yes they watch us -- because we
represent something very threatening
to them to the status quo You
remember what that is

BOBBY
(by rote)
Revolution
REGINA

Yes And sometimes these bad people
want to know about our work so they
spy on us So if someone comes up to
you on the street and asks you
questions about me or Mommys
friends what do you say

BOBBY
(by rote)
I have nothing to say to you

REGINA

INT BOBBYS BEDROOM - LATER

Bobby lies in bed wide awake We HEAR the noise of the
party outside -- loud conversation boisterous laughter

7A

Yellow Revision 10-11-13 8

Bobby stares at the window -- is the man still out there
We feel his anxiety building as he LISTENS INTENTLY to the
sound of the shade SLAPPING against the window sill

Suddenly he sits up opens a drawer He works fast -- like
someone breaking the rules -- lights a candle -- rolls the
wax into balls and stuffs them into his ears

The laughter outside is muted

Bobby stuffs a ball into his other ear With both ears
blocked -- a sudden and wonderful silence

Bobby carries the candle to a CHESSBOARD In absolute silence
he stares at the chessboard In his hand is the NOTEBOOK

CLOSE on Bobbys face candlelit a study in intensity
As Bobby stares at the chessboard everything else in the

room literally begins to disappear The bed the crummy
dresser -- until all that is left is a boy and a chessboard

THE CHESSBOARD 12

Pieces move on their own Multiple exposures A move yields
hundreds of options The counter offers thousands more

CLOSE on Bobbys face Ethereal Music Bliss Then
THE DOOR TO HIS BEDROOM IS FLUNG OPEN 13

Light floods in Harsh SOUNDS The spell is broken The
two open-mouthed kissers are looking for a place to fuck

KISSING MAN
Whoopsee-daisy
(sees Bobby)
Sorry kiddo

BOBBY
Get out of my room GET OUT

Regina appears behind them

REGINA

Yellow Revision 10-11-13 9
Joan appears

REGINA (CONTD)

As Regina returns to the party Joan kneels to pick up the
fallen pieces Bobby looks up at her

BOBBY

She sits beside him on the bed and sets up the board
INT BROOKLYN JEWISH HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - DAY 14

Bobby Joan and Regina sit in a waiting room Regina smooths
Bobbys hair

REGINA
Now Bobby dont suddenly start acting
normal and make me look ridiculous

INT DR MENGARINIS OFFICE - LATER 15

On DOCTOR MENGARINIs desk is a LARGE WOODEN CHESS SET
Across the desk we find Bobby The game is fifteen moves
old Smoke from Megarinis pipe wafts among the chess pieces

MENGARINI
So Bobby you go to the movies
(Bobby nods without
looking up)
You like Westerns Bang bang

Bobby nods again Mengarini glances at Regina
REGINA
Bobby have you ever been to the
Moon on the subway
Bobby nods and moves a piece Hes in a kind of trance
REGINA (CONTD)
Once I poured a glass of water over
his head
Mengarini studies Bobby as Bobby studies the board
REGINA (CONTD)

If I take the pieces away he just
plays in his head Day and night
Yellow Revision 10-11-13
Mengarini moves his knight Bobby counters

MENGARINI
What do you dream about Bobby

Silence Regina shrugs Mengarini takes Bobbys rook

Green Revision 10-14-13 10

MENGARINI (CONTD)
You like Parchesi Monopoly
(to Joan)
Does he play other games with you

JOAN
He says chess is the only game that
doesnt need luck

Mengarini has barely finished moving when Bobby makes a move
This startles Mengarini who frowns at the new positions

JOAN (CONTD)
And he cries when he loses

Bobby glares at her briefly then returns his focus to the
game Mengarini squints at the board then makes his move

MENGARINI
I play chess at quite a high level
His game is pretty good Not
exceptional though
(magnanimous1ly)
A draw

Bobby isnt listening Hes in the zone He initiates an
exchange his Queen takes Mengarinis Bishop

Mengarini grunts makes another move Then Bobby pounces

Mengarini tries to escape but the trap has been sprung
After several moves its clear hes doomed

Mengarini is astonished Bobby looks up at him -- something
new andwellmurderous in his expression

JOAN
He hates draws

MENGARINI
Where the hell did that come from

REGINA
So now you see

Mengarini is still staring at the board in disbelief

MENGARINI
Who taught him to play like this

Yellow Revision 10-11-13 11

JOAN
I bought him the set Last year

MENGARINI
Which club does his belong to

REGINA
He doesnt belong to any club He
taught himself

BOBBY
I need to pee

Joan takes Bobbys hand and leads him out the door

REGINA
So Doctor What do you think

MENGARINI
Mrs Fischer there are worse things
than playing chess Believe me

REGINA
He wants there to be nothing else

Mengarini is now writing on a pad

MENGARINI
I think he should see a professional

REGINA
I thought you were a professional

He hands her the note Carmine Nigro Brooklyn Chess Club

CARMINE

Doctor Mengarini says hes good

But most young people dont have the
concentration to play at this level

so please dont build up your hopes

REGINA
My hopes are he will give up on
the damn game if someone beats him

CARMINE
Okay lets see what we got here

He grabs two chess pieces one black and one white holds
them behind his back and turns to Bobby

though he begins to win and soon he has Bobby trapped

Bobby stares at the board his face reddening He has lost
He HATES to lose He pushes his chair back and walks away
fighting back tears Carmine turns to Regina

Bobby stops before entering the playing area and sees Spassky

Boris looks rested and detached Lombardy sees him looking

LOMBARDY
You got this guy

BOBBY
Think I dont know that

Across the hall Boris senses Bobbys gaze Their eyes meet
We sense the two men have made fatal contact and one of
them must be destroyed Bobby looks away first

Bobby and Spassky approach their table The audience APPLAUDS

The two men stand behind their seats Geller whispers in
Boriss ear Livo Nei hands him a note pad and pen A third
brings him a worksheet a fourth hands him a glass of water

Lombardy leans in to whisper to Bobby
LOMBARDY
Remember dont try to overpress
If he opens with the Nimzo--
BOBBY
(harsh whisper)
You think Im a idiot

Lombardy is mortified Bobby is immediately contrite

BOBBY (CONTD)
-Sorry Father

Green Revision 10-14-13 54

He looks up to see if Boris has heard him Boris steps
forward extending his hand Bobby hesitates and the flicker
of hesitation is caught by Spassky Finally they shake

Boris sits down calmly as Bobby drops into his chair

Bobby is distracted by THE SOUND of a chair scraping His
eyes dart to it

He looks back -- only to realize Boris has been watching him
the whole time Bobby tries to stare at him Boris smiles
He has already won

EXT SANTA MONICA TOURNAMENT HALL 73

The door SLAMS open and Bobby bursts through His fury tells
all He has lost Lombardy and Marshall hurry to catch up

LOMBARDY
Bobby you beat three Russians

MARSHALL
Theyre waiting to give you the
runners-up medal

BOBBY
A medal for losing

LOMBARDY
No one expected you to beat Spassky

BOBBY
She wasnt here was she

MARSHALL

He doesnt wait for an answer and walks off toward the beach

MARSHALL (CONTD)
At least talk to the TV people

EXT SANTA MONICA BEACH - DUSK 74

Bobby trudges in the sand Tears well as he collapses like

a disconsolate child He has lost His carefully-cultivated
illusion of invincibility is shattered revealed for what it
is a cloak for the vast untouchable hole in his heart

He idly draws a chessboard in the wet sand -- torturing
himself with memories of losing

Green Revision 10-14-13 55

A wave rolls in washing out his drawing He sits there
water pooling around him

INT SANTA MONICA MOTEL LOMBARDYS ROOM - THAT NIGHT
Lombardy sits on the bed Marshall enters

MARSHALL
Hes disappeared

He pours himself a drink

LOMBARDY
Hell be back

MARSHALL
How can you be so sure

LOMBARDY
Its all that matters to him Without
chess he doesnt exist

MARSHALL
You think he can ever beat Spassky

Lombardy nurses his drink non-committal

MARSHALL (CONTD)
Hypothetically what would it take
to make him world champion

LOMBARDY
(stares at him)
The desk clerk asked why were making
so many calls to DC I didnt call
DC Who have you been talking to--

MARSHALL
There are peoplein high places
who take an interest in any
confrontation between us and the
Soviet Union

LOMBARDY
The state department
(no answer)
The CIA
(no answer)
The WHITE HOUSE

MARSHALL
Bobby wants limos He gets limos
And theyll throw in honorariums
for each victory

Green Revision 10-14-13

LOMBARDY
Paid for by who

Marshall stares back at him

MARSHALL
Are you a patriot father
LOMBARDY
Mostly
MARSHALL

Bobby may be a little off but he
understands this whole thing better
than you

(looks at him)
Were at war Only its not being
fought by guns and missiles -- not
yet at least -- its a war of
perception The poor kid from
Brooklyn taking on the whole Soviet
Empire The perfect American story

LOMBARDY
(starts to laugh)
Which means youre out schnorring
right wing anti-Communist money
people This wouldnt possibly be
helpful to the Nixon White House

MARSHALL
Theres such a thing as doing
well by doing good And you havent
answered my question

Lombardy takes a sip of whiskey

LOMBARDY
Bobby Fischer is the second best
chess player I have ever seen He
also has severe problems in his head

MARSHALL
Which need to be understood and
managed

LOMBARDY

Managed Bobby

Green Revision 10-14-13 57

LOMBARDY (CONTD)
Greatest player this country ever
had -- before Bobby that is By 21
hed beaten every master in Europe
Liked to play ten people at a time
Blindfolded Then things got a little
weird Started having visions
became convinced people were trying
to poison him Quit at 26 and
eventually killed himself in the
bathtub surrounded by twelve pairs
of ladies shoes

Lombardy takes another sip

LOMBARDY (CONTD)

This game is a rabbit hole After
only four moves there are more than
three hundred billion options to
consider more forty-move games than
the number of stars in the galaxy
more openings defenses gambits
than there are atoms in the universe

(remembering)
It can bring you very close to the
edge Ive been there When I was
twenty-three I--

MARSHALL
(interrupting)
Nice story father With respect
my question was about Bobby Could
he win

Lombardy glares at him

LOMBARDY
If Bobby went for the title it would
mean traveling around the world
playing interzonals for three years
Thats three years in much worse
places than this one

(finishes his whiskey)

In my opinion he might not make it
that long

Marshall stands up taking the bottle with him
MARSHALL

Its your job to see that he does
If we ever find him

EXT BEACH - DAY

Bobby has slept on the beach His clothes are rumpled and
his hair is wild As he sits up he sees an odd sight

A hundred yards down the beach a big black limo has disgorged
three MEN Two are KGB The third is wearing a Beverly Hills
hotel bathrobe Its Boris Spassky come for his morning
swim The KGB men carry his clothes

Bobby watches fascinated as Boris shrugs off his bathrobe
and begins an exercise regime Bobby gets to his knees as
Boris walks into the ocean and begins to swim The KGB guys
smoke cigarettes waiting for Boris to finish

As Boris steps out of the ocean a KGB guy holds out a towel
for him Bobby leaps to his feet and yells

BOBBY
Hey Asshole Theyre not
bodyguards theyre jailers Theyve

got your brain Theyre inside your
mind They wouldnt even let you
kill yourself if you wanted

Boris looks up as Bobby yells but he is far away and looks
like a bum so he doesnt immediately recognize him

KGB GUY
Just some drunk sleeping it off
America is full of them

Bobby meanwhile is laughing to himself He steps into the
ocean fully clothed and begins to splash around

BOBBY
Look at me man Im free

He jumps into the waves and begins to play Boris stares and
slowly realizes its Bobby

BOBBY (CONTD)
Im coming for you man Better
get ready -- cause IMCOMING

The KGB minders quickly hustle Boris away but not before he
looks back to see Bobby take a sardonic bow

We might notice something new in Boriss eyes when he realizes
that Bobby has recovered from the loss He is unnerved

Until it is only Bobby and the chessboard -- which begins to

GLOW as the lines of infinite possibility present themselves

Bobbys move with more than a little confusion He looks up
and sees no expression on Bobbys face

Bobby is in the zone He has reached some kind of absence
in which there are only moves -- and Spassky knows it
