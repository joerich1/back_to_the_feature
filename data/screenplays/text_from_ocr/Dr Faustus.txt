SOUND OF THE WIND

ACROSS THE SCREEN - OCEAN WATERS RUSH
Followed by

TREE-COVERED MOUNTAINS

FIRE RAGING ACROSS A DESERT VELDT

CLOUDS TEAR ACROSS THE SKY Although the landscape changes
the clouds are always there

The face of a REPORTER appears superimposed on the images
She holds a MICROPHONE

REPORTER
(to CAMERA)
We must perform
The form of FAUSTUS’ fortunes good or bad
And now to patient judgments we appeal
And speak for Faustus in his infancy

A SERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHS SHOWS ON THE SCREEN

-- a BABY standing in a PLAYPEN surrounded by TOYS

-- a HANDSOME LAD at PRIZE DAY laden with AWARDS

-- the same LAD now FAUSTUS AT COLLEGE posed with a bottle
of champagne in his ACADEMIC ROBES

-- FAUSTUS triumphing in debate before A CHEERING AUDIENCE

CUT BACK TO REPORTER

REPORTER
Faustus was born his parents base of stock
In Germany within a town called Rhodes
Or riper years to Wittenberg he went
Whereas his kinsmen chiefly brought him up
So soon he profits in divinity
That shortly he was graced with Doctor’s name
Excelling all whose sweet delight disputes
In heavenly matters of Theology --

PULL BACK FROM THE SCREEN

We see that the REPORTER is on a TELEVISION MONITOR in --
INT FAUSTUS’ STUDY

Antique ancient wood-panelled Littered with BOOKS DVDS
STORAGE DISKS MANUSCRIPTS Old ELECTRONIC GEAR

The sound of a clicking mouse

As the REPORTER speaks we find DR JOHN FAUSTUS at his
COMPUTER TERMINAL The screen is covered with files of his work

He looks at the monitor with irritation as the REPORTER continues

REPORTER
Which he prefers before his chiefest bliss

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The REPORTER stands in FAUSTUS’ STUDY with a CAMERA CREW
filming a news segment The PRODUCER watches the monitor

REPORTER
(to CAMERA)
And this the man that in his study sits

She extends the microphone to DR FAUSTUS who ignores her
apparently -- and showily -- absorbed in his work

FAUSTUS is handsome and almost too young for the academic
honours that have come his way Twenty-four twenty-five at most
He is precocious eager brilliant and arrogant Dressed well in the
academic tweed jacket fashion

REPORTER
Settle thy studies Faustus and begin
To sound the depth of that thou wilt profess
CLOSE on the COMPUTER
The ICON that marks the FOLDER “ARISTOTLE”
A PAGE appears on the screen

AT FAUSTUS - he reads and FROWNS theatrically
FAUSTUS
Hmmmmm
(pause)
“To dispute well is logic’s chiefest end”
Affords this art no greater miracle
Then read no more thou hast attained the end
A greater subject fitteth FAUSTUS’ wit

With a flourish he closes the file

FAUSTUS
Be a physican Faustus heap up gold
And be eternised for some wondrous cure

He and the REPORTER laugh stagily at this

With the mouse he clicks on the folder “GALEN MEDICINE”
Opens it

FAUSTUS
(reads from screen)
“The end of physic is our body’s health”

FAUSTUS sits back amused by this He points to all his AWARDS
his PHOTOGRAPHS of himself with grateful and famous patients
his SIGNED TESTIMONIALS from pharmaceutical firms his PHOTO
of himself shaking hands with the PRIME MINISTER etc

REPORTER
Why Faustus hast thou not attained that end
Is not thy common talk sound aphorisms
Are not thy bills hung up as monuments
Whereby whole cities have escaped the plague
And thousand desperate maladies been eased

FAUSTUS takes a moment to be very very pleased with himself and
his achievements But he assumes modesty for his audience

FAUSTUS
Yet I am still but Faustus and a man
Could I make men to live eternally
Or being dead raise them to life again
Then this profession were to be esteemed
(closes the GALEN folder dramatically)
Physic farewell

He turns now to the ICON marked “JURISPRUDENCE” Opens it
and scoffs
FAUSTUS
A pretty case of paltry legacies
(reads)
“If the same thing is left to two persons one shall
have the thing itself the other its value”

He clicks the folder closed with disgust

FAUSTUS
The universal body of the law
Its study fits a mercenary drudge
Who aims at nothing but external trash
Too servile and illiberal for me

Pause Here comes his big dramatic moment His mouse finds the
icon for “BIBLE THE” He opens it

FAUSTUS
When all is done Divinity is best

He adopts a pious expression as the CAMERA zooms in for his close
up

Then ‘CUT’ CREW packs up to leave REPORTER and PRODUCER
shake hands with FAUSTUS They exit

Pause

FAUSTUS goes back to his computer and sees the open folder
He tries to close it It won’t close The ON SCREEN PAGE turns
He shrugs defeated by the whims of technology

FAUSTUS

Jerome’s Bible Faustus view it well

(idly reads)
Ha

(reads aloud)
“The reward of sin is death”

(thinks this over uneasy in spite of himself)
That’s hard

He talks to himself as if he is still being interviewed meanwhile trying
to close the file and reboot the computer

FAUSTUS
If we say that we have no sin
We deceive ourselves and there’s no truth in us
Why then belike we must sin
And so consequently die
Frustrated now that the computer refuses to shut off he follows
the cable through the mess of his office to turn off the current at
the source

He tunnels under huge piles of dusty papers and books as he
continues talking to himself

FAUSTUS
I -- we -- must die an everlasting death
What doctrine call you this Che sera sera
What will be will be

(finds the PLUG and PULLS IT)
Divinity adieu

The violence of his movement destabilizes a tower of books From
its top an ANCIENT DUSTY LEATHERBOUND TOME FALLS IN
SLOW MOTION - and hits FAUSTUS on the head

FAUSTUS
Ack

He struggles out from under the pile of papers clutching the BOOK

Looks down at it An engraved PENTAGRAM on the cover is all that
identifies it

He opens the book The writing is gibberish Carrying it over to the
blank computer monitor he holds the BOOK up to it and reads the
reflection

We see the BOOK is backwards writing And it can now be read
Fascinated FAUSTUS sinks into his chair reading

SAME - LATER

A growing pile of dusty books around FAUSTUS He reads with
increasing enthusiasm

SAME - LATER
Even more books FAUSTUS reads wild-eyed
He sits back lost in thought

FAUSTUS

These metaphysics of Magicians
And necromantic books are heavenly (CONT)
FAUSTUS (CONT)
Lines circles letters characters
(with increasing excitement)
Ay These are those that Faustus most desires
Oh what a world of profit and delight
Of power of honour of omnipotence
Is promised to the studious artisan

Getting up in his excitement he continues to study the BOOK so
absorbed he doesn’t hear a knock at the door

His scout MRS WAGNER enters Laden down with cleaning
equipment she waves to get his attention He ignores her
Shrugging she starts to dust

FAUSTUS

All things that move between the quiet poles
Shall be at my command Emperors and kings
Are but obeyed in their several provinces
Nor can they raise the wind or rend the clouds
But his dominion that exceeds in THIS

(shakes the BOOK)
Stretcheth as far as doth the mind of man

He loses himself in a happy dream His mind he is sure stretches
into eternity -- and beyond

FAUSTUS
A sound magician is a mighty god
Here Faustus try thy brains to gain a deity

MMMMWWWWWOOORRRRRRR MRS WAGNER starts the vacuum
cleaner

FAUSTUS
Wagner

(she shuts off the HOOVER)
Commend me to my dearest friends
The scientists Valdes and Cornelius
Request them earnestly to visit me

MRS WAGNER
I will sir

The hoovering starts again
FAUSTUS

Their conference will be a greater help to me
Than all my labours plod I ne’er so fast
Carrying the BOOK he retreats from the noise into the bedroom
little more than a cupboard off the study

INT FAUSTUS’ BEDROOM

He shuts the door and resumes studying the BOOK reflected now in
his bedside mirror

The contents page “TO TURN BASE METAL INTO GOLD” “TO WIN
THE LOVE OF MAN OR WOMAN” “TO ESCAPE DEATH”

Through a tiny window sunlight pours into the room The GOOD
ANGEL appears wreathed in light

GOOD ANGEL
Oh Faustus lay that damned book aside
And gaze not on it lest it tempt thy soul
And heap God’s heavy wrath upon thy head
Read read the Scriptures That is blasphemy

At another tiny window overgrown with cobwebs and ivy it is raining
outside

A huge spider crawls in This is the EVIL ANGEL

EVIL ANGEL
Go forward Faustus in that famous art
Wherein all Nature’s treasury is contained
Be thou on earth as Jove is in the sky
Lord and commander of these elements

FAUSTUS ignores them both continues reading

INT CORRIDORS OF THE COLLEGE - DAY
FAUSTUS still reading hurries to the SCIENCE LAB

FAUSTUS
How am I glutted with conceit of this
Shall I make spirits fetch me what I please
Resolve me of all ambiguities
Perform what desperate enterprises I will

CUT TO --
INT SCIENCE LAB

Huge surreal interior with line upon line of CAGES HOLDING
SCREAMING ANIMALS and WEIRD SCIENTIFIC DEVICES

FAUSTUS approaches through two long lines of cages

FAUSTUS
Ill have them fly to India for gold
Ransack the ocean for orient pearl
And search all corners of the newfound world
For pleasant fruits and princely delicates
Ill have them read me strange philosophy
And tell the secrets of all foreign kings

UP AHEAD - VALDES and CORNELIUS a his and her science team
wearing white lab coats experiment on a DEAD DOG

FAUSTUS
Valdes Sweet Valdes and Cornelius
Know that your words have won me at the last
To practice magic and concealed arts
Yet not your words only but mine own fantasy
Tis magic magic that hath ravished me

INT OFFICE OF VALDES AND CORNELIUS
Excited CORNELIUS loads folders from his COMPUTER onto a DVD

VALDES
Faustus these books thy wit and our experience
Shall make all nations to canonize us

CORNELIUS
The miracles that magic will perform
Will make thee vow to study nothing else
He that is grounded in astrology
Enriched with tongues well seen in minerals

VALDES heaps FAUSTUS with various BOOKS DVDs CDs VHS
TAPES etc

CORNELIUS
Hath all the principles magic doth require

VALDES
(confidentially)
The spirits tell me they can dry the sea (CONT)
VALDEZ (CONT)
And fetch the treasure of all foreign wrecks
Ay all the wealth our forefathers hid
Within the massy entrails of the earth

The SOUND of a DOG HOWLING from the lab
CORNELIUS shoves the door shut with his foot

CORNELIUS
(triumphant)
Then tell me Faustus what shall we three want

Finished burning a DVD he hands it to FAUSTUS

FAUSTUS
Nothing Cornelius Oh this cheers my soul
Come show me some demonstrations magical
That I may conjure in some lusty grove
And have these joys in full possession

CORNELIUS
Valdes first let him know the words of art
And then all other ceremonies learned
Faustus may try his cunning by himself

VALDES
(to FAUSTUS)
First ’ll instruct thee in the rudiments
And then wilt thou be perfecter than I

FAUSTUS
Then come and dine with me and after meat
Well canvas every quiddity thereof
For ere I sleep Ill try what I can do
This night I’ll conjure though I die therefore

INT COLLEGE QUADRANGLE - NIGHT

Dinner has ended and the QUADRANGLE is abuzz as the gathering
spills out and breaks up The Rector of the College an OLD MAN
whose experience and wisdom show plainly on his face and in his
bearing says good-bye to his GUESTS and fellow COLLEGE
MEMBERS SCHOLAR 1 SCHOLAR 2 and SCHOLAR 3 walk
away from the group talking as MRS WAGNER crosses with an
ARMLOAD OF CHAMPAGNE

SCHOLAR 1
I wonder what’s become of Faustus
SCHOLAR 2
(accosts MRS WAGNER)
How now where’s the doctor

MRS WAGNER
(indicates the CHAMPAGNE)
Truly he’s within at dinner with Valdes and
Cornelius as this wine if it could speak
would inform you

She hurries away opening a DOOR onto the Quadrangle

The SOUND OF A RAUCOUS PARTY emerges Shouts Music

MANIACAL LAUGHTER

SPARKS WHIZZING LIGHTS COLOURED SMOKE etc belch
from the room as if CONJURING is taking place inside

The SCHOLARS look at each other concerned

SCHOLAR 1
(lowers his voice)
Nay then I fear he is fallen into that
damned art for which they two are infamous
throughout the world

SCHOLAR 2
Were he a stranger and not allied to me
yet should I grieve for him But come let us
go and inform the Rector and see if he by his
grave counsel can reclaim him

SCHOLAR 3
Go and try what you can do

They turn and hurry after the OLD MAN

INT STAIRCASE NIGHT

FAUSTUS drunk overexcited returns from the PARTY
He holds an armload of DVDs BOOKS and CHAMPAGNE

THUNDER rumbles

SHOUTS OF LAUGHTER follow him up the stairs
And FAUSTUS excited can wait no longer He must begin
He unlocks the door to his study --

INT FAUSTUS’ STUDY NIGHT
LIGHTNING flashes across the QUADRANGLE outside

FAUSTUS knocks piles of books aside makes a SPACE IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE ROOM

Goes to the COMPUTER puts in one of the DVDs that VALDES gave
him The PRINTER belches out page after page of HEXAGRAMS

As it does FAUSTUS lights CANDLES around the space

FAUSTUS
Now that the gloomy shadow of the earth
Longing to view Orion’s dazzling look
Leaps from the Antarctic world unto the sky
And dims the welkin with her pitchy breath

FAUSTUS lays the printed pages out in a CIRCLE Put together in
the right way they form a PRINTED HEXAGRAM

FAUSTUS
Faustus begin thine incantations
And try if devils will obey thy hest
(drinks champagne for courage)
Seeing thou has prayed and sacrificed to them

He surveys the printed HEXAGRAM straightening it

OUTSIDE - LIGHTNING flashes THUNDER rumbles
FAUSTUS looks up Puts out the lone light

Taking a deep breath and another swig of CHAMPAGNE he begins
to walk slowly counter-clockwise inside the PRINTED CIRCLE

FAUSTUS
Within this circle is Jehovah’s name
Forward and backward anagrammatised
The ‘breviated names of holy saints
Figures of every adjunct to the heavens
And characters of signs and erring stars
By which the spirits are enforced to rise

He stops shuts his eyes Almost falters but steels himself
FAUSTUS
Then fear not Faustus but be resolute
And try the utmost magic can perform

Collects himself Takes a final deep breath Lifts his arms over the
circle

Thunder roars But FAUSTUS’ voice roars up to meet it

FAUSTUS
(shouting)
Sint mihi dei Acherontis propitii Valeat numen triplex
Iehovae Ignei aerii aquatici spiritus salvete
Orientis princeps Lucifer Beelzebub inferni ardentis
monarcha et Demogorgon propitiamus vos ut
appareat et surgat Mephistophilis

FAUSTUS pauses Nothing The thunder roars more loudly still
And FAUSTUS roars with it

FAUSTUS
Quid tu moraris Per Jehovam Gehennam et
consecratum acquam quam nunc spargo signumque
cruces quod nunc facio et per vota nostra ipse nunc
surgat nobis dicatus Mephistophilis

FAUSTUS sprinkles HOLY WATER on the floor and makes a sign of
the cross

A sudden wind rattles through the room

A candle blows out

In the shadow of the dead candle a movement

OUT OF THE SHADOW - A hideous and deformed DEVIL appears

FAUSTUS stares at this apparition with fascination and horror
Then with a voice that slightly trembles he addresses it

FAUSTUS
I charge thee to return and change thy shape
Thou art too ugly to attend on me

THE DEVIL fades back into the shadow and disappears

FAUSTUS emboldened by his success shouts after the apparition
FAUSTUS
Go and return an old Franciscan friar
That holy shape becomes a devil best

Pause
Silence

FAUSTUS looks around him and at himself up and down as if to
make sure he’s still in one piece

He laughs as his confidence returns

FAUSTUS
I see there’s virtue in my heavenly words
Who would not be proficient in this art

He luxuriates now in his proved power

FAUSTUS
How pliant is this Mephistophilis
Full of obedience and humility
Such is the force of magic and my spells

FAUSTUS picks up the BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE looks around for
a glass but realizes he can’t step outside of the circle Instead he
toasts himself and his achievement with a slug from the bottle

FAUSTUS
Now Faustus thou art conjuror laureate
That canst command great Mephistophilis

MEPHISTOPHILIS enters behind FAUSTUS

He is handsome Dark Young though older than Faustus --
about thirty He’s dressed as a BIKER PRIEST with an expensive
black leather jacket and a peace medallion around his neck

He exudes casual elegance
MEPHISTOPHILIS
(striking a match)

Now Faustus what wouldst thou have me do

FAUSTUS jumps dropping the CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE He turns
and sees MEPHISTOPHILIS who suavely lights himself a cigarette

MEPHISTOPHILIS offers FAUSTUS one from the pack
FAUSTUS trying to keep his hand steady reaches for the offered
smoke But then he realizes his hand will have to leave the magic
hexagram

He declines

MEPHISTOPHILIS smokes With a gesture he urges FAUSTUS to
speak up

FAUSTUS
(hurriedly)
I charge thee wait upon me while I live
To do whatever Faustus shall command
Be it to make the moon drop from her sphere
Or the ocean to overwhelm the world

Pause MEPHISTOPHILIS frowns
He stubs out his cigarette and folds his arms

MEPHISTOPHILIS
I am servant to great Lucifer
And may not follow thee without his leave
No more than he commands must we perform

FAUSTUS
(aggrieved)
Did not he charge thee to appear to me

MEPHISTOPHILIS plays idly with a WORLD GLOBE

MEPHISTOPHILIS
No I came hither of my own accord

FAUSTUS
Did not my conjuring speeches raise thee

MEPHISTOPHILIS grins at this

FAUSTUS
Speak

MEPHISTOPHILIS
That was the cause but yet by accident
For when we hear one rack the name of God
Abjure the Scriptures and his Saviour Christ
We fly in hope to get his glorious soul
Nor will we come unless he use such means (CONT)
MEPHISTOPHILIS (CONT)
Whereby he is in danger to be damned
Therefore the shortest cut for conjuring
Is stoutly to abjure all godliness
And pray devoutly to the Prince of Hell

FAUSTUS feels confident again

FAUSTUS
So Faustus hath
Already done and holds this principle
There is no chief but only BEELZEBUB
To whom Faustus doth dedicate himself
This word “damnation” terrifies not me
For I confound hell in Elysium
But leaving these vain trifles of men’s souls
Tell me what is that Lucifer thy lord

Through this speech the BACK WALL OF THE STUDY dissolves
into a WALL OF CRACKLING FLAME

FAUSTUS does not notice this
MEPHISTOPHILIS expressionless does

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Arch-regent and commander of all spirits

FAUSTUS
Was not that Lucifer an angel once

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Yes Faustus and most dearly loved of God

FAUSTUS
How comes it then that he is prince of devils

MEPHISTOPHILIS looks about for something to drink The
champagne bottle has rolled out of the hexagram circle There is
just enough left in it for him to pour himself a glass He drinks

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Oh by aspiring pride and insolence
For which God threw him from the face of heaven

FAUSTUS
And what are you that live with Lucifer
MEPHISTOPHILIS can’t stand the sight of the fire behind FAUSTUS
any more A wave of his hand and it dissolves back into the study
wall

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Unhappy spirits that live with Lucifer
Conspired against our God with Lucifer
And are forever damned with Lucifer

FAUSTUS
(fascinated)
Where are you damned

MEPHISTOPHILIS
In hell

Finishing his glass of champagne he puts it down Rubs his hand
over his eyes then collects himself

The light keeps changing on MEPHISTOPHILIS as if there were still
a fire nearby

FAUSTUS
How comes it then that thou are out of hell

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Why this is hell nor am I out of it

FAUSTUS laughs at this what he assumes is a sophisticated joke
MEPHISTOPHILIS looks at him with contempt

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Think’st thou that I who saw the face of God
And tasted the eternal joys of heaven
Am not tormented with ten thousand hells
In being deprived of everlasting bliss

The wall behind FAUSTUS again DISSOLVES INTO A WALL OF
FLAME From it can be heard CRACKLING and the CRIES OF
THE DAMNED

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Oh Faustus leave these frivolous demands
Which strike a terror to my fainting soul

FAUSTUS laughs HELL disappears FAUSTUS taunts
MEPHISTOPHILIS
FAUSTUS
What is great Mephistophilis so passionate
For being deprived of the joys of heaven
Learn thou of Faustus manly fortitude
And scorn those joys thou never shalt possess
Go bear these tidings to great Lucifer
Seeing Faustus hath incurred eternal death
By desperate thoughts against God’s deity
Say I surrender up to him my soul
So he will spare me four and twenty year

INT CORRIDOR OUTSIDE FAUSTUS’ STUDY

The OLD MAN approaches pauses at the closed door listens to
FAUSTUS’ VOICE

FAUSTUS’ VOICE
(through the door)
Letting me live in all voluptuousness
Having thee ever to attend on me
To give me whatsoever I shall ask

The door blows open seemingly by a wind The OLD MAN pulls back
into the shadows of the corridor

THROUGH THE DOOR
we can see FAUSTUS in his paper circle talking to thin air

FAUSTUS
To tell me whatsoever I demand
To slay my enemies and aid my friends
And always be obedient to my will

The wind whirls up behind FAUSTUS as he raises his arm ina
magical gesture of command

FAUSTUS
Go And return to mighty Lucifer
And meet me in my study at midnight
And then resolve me of thy master’s mind

THE VOICE OF MEPHISTOPHILIS
I will Faustus

IN THE CORRIDOR
A wind rushes by the OLD MAN as MEPHISTOPHILIS invisible
exits

The door to the study slams shut in the OLD MAN’s face

IN FAUSTUS’ STUDY

FAUSTUS picks up the WORLD GLOBE and tosses it gloating on
what he has done

FAUSTUS
Had I as many souls as there be stars
I’d give them all for Mephistophilis
By him Ill be great emperor of the world
And make a bridge through the moving air
To pass the ocean with a band of men
Ill join the hills that bind the Afric shore
And make that country continent to Spain
And both contributory to my crown
The Emperor shall not live but by my leave
Nor any potentate of Germany
Now that I have obtained what I desire
Ill live in speculation of this art
Till Mephistophilis return again

FAUSTUS tosses the GLOBE too high It falls with a CRASH

THE SOUND OF CHURCH BELLS

EXT UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS - GRADUATION DAY

FAUSTUS in full academic regalia at the centre of a big crowd
UNIVERSITY DIGNITARIES in their academic robes GRADUATING
STUDENTS PARENTS PHOTOGRAPHERS etc

FAUSTUS performs his duties shakes hands with all he comes
across Tumult No one can hear a word he says

FAUSTUS

(shaking hands with a set of PARENTS)
Now Faustus must thou needs be damned
And canst thou not be saved
What boots it then to think of God or heaven
Away with such vain fancies and despair --
Despair in God and trust in Beelzebub
Now go not backward no
Faustus be resolute why waverest thou
All line up for a GROUP PHOTOGRAPH FAUSTUS stands with
his STUDENTS

FAUSTUS
Oh something sounded in mine ears
(mimics GOOD ANGEL)
“Abjure this magic turn to God again”
Ay and Faustus will turn to God again
To God He loves me not

FLASH FLASH PARENTS and PRESS take photographs
The STUDENTS throw their CAPS in the air
FAUSTUS shakes hands with TWO PRIESTS

FAUSTUS
The God I serve is mine own appetite
Wherein is fixed the love of Beelzebub

They don’t hear him They smile and nod

FAUSTUS
To him Ill build an altar and a church
And offer lukewarm blood of newborn babes

The GOOD ANGEL appears in the sky above

GOOD ANGEL
Sweet Faustus leave that execrable art

The EVIL ANGEL as a spider slides down a thread and dangles
next to his head

EVIL ANGEL
Go forward Faustus in that famous art

GRADUATION happy pandemonium around him

FAUSTUS
Contrition prayer repentance what of them

GOOD ANGEL
Oh they are means to bring you unto heaven

EVIL ANGEL
Rather illusions fruits of lunacy
That makes men foolish that do trust them most

GOOD ANGEL
Sweet Faustus think of heaven and heavenly things

EVIL ANGEL
No Faustus think of honour and wealth

FAUSTUS his face transfixed pushes aside a celebrating STUDENT
who looks after him with surprise

FAUSTUS
Of WEALTH

CRANE UP - FAUSTUS elbows his way through the CELEBRATING
THRONG

ON THE STREET

FAUSTUS hurries back to his rooms past the REPORTER
She speaks microphone in hand to the CAMERA

REPORTER
So swollen with cunning of a self-conceit
His waxen wings may mount above his reach
Will melting heavens conspire his overthrow
For falling to a devilish exercise
And glutted more with learning’s golden gifts
He surfeits upon cursed necromancy
Nothing so sweet as MAGIC is to him

CUT TO --

EXT THE CLOCK TOWER

The CLOCK shows TWO MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT

INT FAUSTUS’ STUDY
FAUSTUS paces the study as the clock chimes midnight

FAUSTUS
When Mephistophilis shall stand by me
What God can hurt me Faustus thou art safe
Cast no more doubts Come Mephistophilis
And bring glad tidings from great Lucifer
Is’t not midnight Come Mephistophilis

The clock finishes its chime
MEPHISTOPHILIS appears

FAUSTUS
Now tell me what says Lucifer thy lord

MEPHISTOPHILIS
That I shall wait on Faustus whilst he lives
So he will buy my services with his soul

FAUSTUS
Already Faustus hath hazarded that for thee

MEPHISTOPHILIS comes close puts his hand on his arm
FAUSTUS involuntarily shudders and shrinks back

MEPHISTOPHILIS
But Faustus thou must bequeath it solemnly
And write a deed of gift with thine own blood
For that security craves great Lucifer
If thou deny it I will back to hell

MEPHISTOPHILIS makes as if to go

FAUSTUS hesitates forces himself to stop MEPHISTOPHILIS by
laying his hand on his arm

FAUSTUS
Stay Mephistophilis and tell me what good
Will my soul do thy lord

MEPHISTOPHILIS takes out his cigarette case and shrugging
lights himself a cigarette

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Enlarge his kingdom

FAUSTUS
Is that the reason why he tempts us thus

MEPHISTOPHILIS laughs at this

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Misery loves company
FAUSTUS
Why have you any pain that torture others

MEPHISTOPHILIS
As great as have the human souls of men

MEPHISTOPHILIS is impatient with this line of thought

MEPHISTOPHILIS
But tell me Faustus shall I have thy soul
And I will be thy slave and wait on thee
And tell thee more than thou hast wit to ask

FAUSTUS hesitates Then takes the plunge

FAUSTUS
Ay Mephistophilis I give it thee

MEPHISTOPHILIS takes a PENKNIFE from FAUSTUS’ DESK

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Then Faustus stab thy arm courageously
And bind thy soul that at some certain day
Great Lucifer may claim it as his own
And then be thou as great as Lucifer

FAUSTUS takes the PENKNIFE and nerves himself

FAUSTUS

Lo Mephistophilis for love of thee

(stabs his arm with the knife)
I cut mine arm and with my proper blood
Assure my soul to be great Lucifer’s
Chief lord and regent of perpetual night
View here the blood that trickles from mine arm
And let it be propitious for my wish

MEPHISTOPHILIS produces a QUILL PEN and PAPER from one
pocket

MEPHISTOPHILIS
But Faustus thou must
Write it in manner of a deed of gift

FAUSTUS reckless takes them dips the pen in his own blood
and writes

FAUSTUS
Ay so I will

He dips the pen again Frowns

FAUSTUS
But Mephistophilis --
My blood congeals and I can write no more

MEPHISTOPHILIS anxious to get the deal done inspects his arm

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Ill fetch thee fire to dissolve it straight

From his other pocket he produces a HANDFUL OF GLOWING
COALS

FAUSTUS
What might the staying of my blood portend
Is it unwilling I should write this bill
Why streams it not that I might write afresh
“Faustus gives to thee his soul” -- ah here it stayed
Why shouldst I not Is not my soul my own
Then write again “Faustus gives to thee his soul”

MEPHISTOPHILIS listens to this with impatient contempt

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Here’s fire come Faustus set it on

He waves the coals under FAUSTUS’ wound

FAUSTUS
So now the blood begins to clear again
Now will I make an end immediately

He writes
MEPHISTOPHILIS is disgusted with himself

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Oh what will not I do to obtain his soul

FAUSTUS
Consummatum est This bill is ended
And Faustus hath bequeathed his soul to Lucifer
But what is this inscription on mine arm
“Man fly” Whither should I fly
If unto God he’ll throw me down to hell
My senses are deceived here’s nothing writ
I see it plain here in this place is writ
“Man fly” Yet shall not Faustus fly

MEPHISTOPHILIS hurries to put an end to this waffling

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Ill fetch him something to delight his mind

THE SOUND OF MOTORCYCLES
FAUSTUS looks up

A SHOWER OF GOLD falls down on him
ANGLE ON

TWO HANDSOME YOUNG DEVILS in BLACK LEATHER
MOTORCYCLE GEAR appearing on either side of MEPHISTOPHILIS

They hold an expensive set of clothes including a BLACK LEATHER
JACKET and MOTORCYCLE BOOTS

With a snap of his fingers MEPHISTOPHILIS causes the clothes to
appear on FAUSTUS

The TWO DEVILS disappear to the FURTHER ROAR OF
MOTORCYCLES

FAUSTUS
Speak Mephistophilis what means this show

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Nothing Faustus but to delight thy mind withal
And to show thee what magic can perform

FAUSTUS admires his new leather jacket and boots

FAUSTUS
But may I raise up spirits when I please

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Ay Faustus and do greater things than these

FAUSTUS hurries to sign the bond

MEPHISTOPHILIS watches with contempt a creature so easily
bought

FAUSTUS
Then there’s enough for a thousand souls
Here Mephistophilis receive this scroll (CONT)
FAUSTUS (CONT)
A deed of gift of body and soul
But yet conditionally that thou perform
All articles prescribed between us both

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Faustus I swear by hell and Lucifer
To effect all promises between us made

FAUSTUS
Then hear me read them
(reads the BOND)
“On these conditions following
First that Faustus may be a spirit in form and substance
Secondly that Mephistophilis shall be his servant and
at his command
Thirdly that Mephistophilis shall do for him and bring
him whatsoever
Fourthly that he shall be in his chamber or house
invisible
Lastly that he shall appear to the said John Faustus
at all times in what form or shape soever
he please
I John Faustus of Wittenberg Doctor by these presents
do give both body and soul to Lucifer
Prince of the East and his minister
Mephistophilis and furthermore grant unto
them that twenty-four years being expired
the articles above written inviolate full
power to fetch or carry the said John
Faustus body and soul flesh blood or
goods into their habitation wheresoever
By me John Faustus”

Pause

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Speak Faustus do you deliver this as your deed

Pause again

FAUSTUS
Ay take it and the Devil give thee good on’t

MEPHISTOPHILIS takes the SIGNED BOND

He tears off a CARBON RECEIPT and handing it to FAUSTUS
carefully pockets the original

MEPHISTOPHILIS snaps his fingers and the study vanishes --
-- and becomes --

EXT A ROCKY PRECIPICE IN A DESERT LANDSCAPE

A MILLION STARS shine overhead

FAUSTUS looks up amazed

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Now Faustus ask what thou wilt

FAUSTUS
First will I question with thee about hell
Tell me where is the place that men call hell

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Under the heavens

FAUSTUS
Ay but whereabouts

MEPHISTOPHILIS sighs at his slowness

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Within the bowels of these elements
Where we are tortured and remain forever
Hell hath no limits nor is circumscribed
In one self place for where we are is hell
And where hell is there must we ever be
And to conclude when all the world dissolves
And every creature shall be purified
All places shall be hell that are not heaven

FAUSTUS throughout this answer practices his newfound powers

He finds that with a wave of his hand he can make a star fall
He is pleased with himself

FAUSTUS
Come I think hell’s a fable

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Ay think so till experience change thy mind

FAUSTUS
(surprised)
Why thinkst thou then that Faustus shall be damned

MEPHISTOPHILIS
(with exaggerated patience)
Ay of necessity for here’s the scroll
(waves the BOND)
Wherein thou hast given thy soul to Lucifer

FAUSTUS with a gesture makes a METEOR SHOWER appear
He is distracted by this

FAUSTUS
Ay and body too but what of that
Thinks thou that Faustus is so fond to imagine
That after this life there is any pain
Tush these are trifles and mere old wives’s tales

MEPHISTOPHILIS
But Faustus I am an instance to prove the contrary
For Iam damned and am now in hell

The DESERT VANISHES leaving instead --

INT FAUSTUS’ STUDY
FAUSTUS looks around himself in surprise

FAUSTUS
How now in hell
Nay if this be hell Ill willingly be damned
What sleeping eating walking and disputing

MEPHISTOPHILIS shakes his head at the stupidity of man
FAUSTUS cajoles him

FAUSTUS
But leaving this let me have a wife
the fairest maid in Germany for 1am
wanton and lascivious and cannot live
without a wife

MEPHISTOPHILIS
(humouring him)
Well Faustus thou shalt have a wife

He snaps his fingers and the TWO DEVILS reappear
They wheel in the BRIDE OF FAUSTUS on a trolley
The BRIDE is eight feet tall A combination sex doll rock star and
Bride of Frankenstein She’s wrapped in a wedding cake of barbed
wire and carries a papier-mache rolling pin

She sees FAUSTUS and screams

FAUSTUS
What sight is this

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Tell me Faustus how dost thou like thy wife

FAUSTUS
(disgusted)
Here’s a hot whore indeed No Ill no wife

MEPHISTOPHILIS snaps his fingers and the DEVILS wheel the
BRIDE away

Instead a QUARTET OF BEAUTY QUEENS in high heels and
bathing suits promenade across the floor

They are (according to the banners worn across their chests)
MS BERKELEY MLLE SORBONNE MISS PRINCETON MISS
OLD HEIDELBERG (in monocle high-heeled leather boots and
duelling scar)

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Marriage is but a ceremonial toy
If thou lovest me think no more of it
Ill cull thee out the fairest courtesans
And bring them every morning to thy bed

FAUSTUS’ eyes pop at the sight of the BEAUTY QUEENS
MEPHISTOPHILIS

She whom thine eye shall like thy heart shall have

Be she chaste as was Penelope

As wise as Sheba or as beautiful

As was bright Lucifer before his fall
As MISS OLD HEIDELBERG turns we see her DEVIL’S TAIL twitch
The DEVILS quickly move to hide this sight

One hands an iBOOK COMPUTER to MEPHISTOPHILIS who
distracts FAUSTUS by presenting it to him

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Here take this book peruse it well
The iterating of these lines brings gold
(hands him a PEN DRIVE)
The framing of this circle on the ground
Brings thunder whirlwinds storm and lightning
(hands him a MEMORY CARD)
Pronounce this thrice devoutly to thyself
And men in armour shall appear to thee
Ready to execute what thou desir’st

FAUSTUS
Thanks Mephistophilis yet fain would I have
a book wherein I might behold all spells
and incantations that I might raise up spirits
when I please

MEPHISTOPHILIS
(turns on iBOOK points)
Here they are in this book

FAUSTUS
Now would I have a book where I might see all
characters and planets of the heavens that I might
know their motions and dispositions

MEPHISTOPHILIS opens that folder

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Here they are too

FAUSTUS
Nay let me have one book more and then I
have done wherein I might see all plants
herbs and trees that grow upon the earth

MEPHISTOPHILIS
(manipulates the keyboard)
Here they be

FAUSTUS
Oh thou art deceived

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Tut I warrant thee

FAUSTUS laughs with delight at the pictures that roll by
on the laptop screen

He and MEPHISTOPHILIS bend over it discussing its wonders

EXT QUADRANGLE - DAWN

The OLD MAN emerges from his staircase
He looks up at the window of FAUSTUS’ study

Lights flash MUSIC pounds

INT FAUSTUS’ STUDY - DAWN

The DEVILS and the DEVIL BEAUTY QUEENS cavort in the study
which has been transformed into a DISCOTHEQUE that extends far
beyond its boundaries Flashing STROBE LIGHTS A revolving
GLITTER GLOBE

MUSIC POUNDS LOUDLY

MEPHISTOPHILIS acts a DJ

FAUSTUS wearing a white satin suit sits bleary-eyed on a raised
banquette watching the action

In front of him are a platter of half-eaten canapés a mound of half-
snorted cocaine and a bottle of half-drunk tequila

He gets up sways unsteadily and staggers out

The MUSIC screeches to a halt

THE DISCOTHEQUE vanishes replaced by the STUDY
The DEVILS look at MEPHISTOPHILIS

He shrugs

EXT THE COLLEGE GARDEN - SUNRISE

The SUN rises and fills the sky with a rose and turquoise glow
The MOON and the MORNING STAR still hang low on the horizon
BIRDS sing DEW glistens on the green leaves

FAUSTUS appears Anguished he looks at the magnificence
of the morning sky

FAUSTUS
When I behold the heavens then I repent
And curse thee Mephistophilis
Because thou hast deprived me of those joys

VOICE OF MEPHISTOPHILIS
Why Faustus
Thinkst thou heaven is such a glorious thing
I tell thee ‘tis not half so fair as thou
Or any man that breathes on earth

FAUSTUS looks at his shaking hands He is disgusted with himself

FAUSTUS
How provest thou that

MEPHISTOPHILIS appears on a bench again lighting a cigarette
Again he offers one to FAUSTUS

FAUSTUS shakes his head

MEPHISTOPHILIS
It was made for man therefore is man more excellent

FAUSTUS
If it were made for man ‘twas made for me
I will renounce this magic and repent

A rustling from the trees above
The VOICES OF THE GOOD ANGEL and the BAD ANGEL sound

VOICE OF GOOD ANGEL
Faustus repent yet will God pity thee

VOICE OF EVIL ANGEL
Thou art a spirit God cannot pity thee

FAUSTUS
Who buzzeth in mine ears I am a spirit
Be I a devil yet God may pity me
Ay God will pity me if I repent
TILT UP TO THE TREE
We see the SPIDER’S WEB OF THE EVIL ANGEL

THE GOOD ANGEL is trapped Her wings flutter helplessly

The EVIL ANGEL scuttles across the web toward her

EVIL ANGEL
(laughing)
Ay but Faustus never shall repent

INT FAUSTUS’ STUDY - DAY
FAUSTUS sits depressed MEPHISTOPHILIS sits next to him

FAUSTUS
My heart’s so hardened I cannot repent
Scarce can I name salvation faith or heaven
But fearful echoes thunder in mine ears
“Faustus thou art damned” Then swords and knives
Poison guns halters and envenomed steel
Are laid before me to dispatch myself
And long ere this I should have slain myself
Had not sweet pleasure conquered deep despair

MEPHISTOPHILIS waves a hand and once again the STUDY
VANISHES leaving --

EXT A TEMPLE IN ANCIENT GREECE

On the steps under the massive pillars MEPHISTOPHILIS and
FAUSTUS sit Both wear TOGAS

FAUSTUS
Have I not made blind Homer sing to me
Of Alexander’s love and Oenon’s death
And hath not he that built the walls of Thebes
With ravishing sound of his melodious harp
Made music with my Mephistophilis
Why should I die then or basely despair
Iam resolved Faustus shall not repent
Come Mephistophilis let us dispute again
And argue of divine astrology
Tell me are there many heavens above the moon
Are all celestial bodies but one globe
As is the substance of this centric earth

MEPHISTOPHILIS
As are the elements such are the spheres
Mutually folded in each other’s orb
And jointly move upon one axletree (CONT)

MEPHISTOPHILIS (CONT)
Whose boundary is termed the world’s wide pole
Nor are the names of Saturn Mars or Jupiter
Feigned but are erring stars

ANGLE ON - A GROUP OF LEARNED GREEKS who nod sagely at
MEPHISTOPHILIS’ words

FAUSTUS
Tush these slender trifles Wagner can decide
Hath Mephistophilis no greater skill
Tell me hath every sphere a dominion or intelligence

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Ay

Waves his hand again and ANCIENT GREECE VANISHES replaced
by --

INT SPACE STATION
In orbit around SATURN
Airless deserted punctured with holes Long deserted by its makers

MEPHISTOPHILIS and FAUSTUS stare out the cracked picture
window at the huge gas planet below

FAUSTUS
How many heavens or spheres are there

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Nine the seven planets the firmament and
the empyreal heaven

FAUSTUS
Resolve me in this question why have we not
conjunctions oppositions aspects eclipses
all at one time but in some years we have
more in some less

MEPHISTOPHILIS
(yawns)
Unequal motion in relation to the whole

FAUSTUS is depressed He knows all of this

But he can’t think of how to ask about what he doesn’t know

FAUSTUS
Well I am answered

Pause

FAUSTUS thinks of a real question

FAUSTUS
Tell me who made the world
MEPHISTOPHILIS
I will not
FAUSTUS

(coaxes)
Sweet Mephistophilis tell me

BEHIND THEM - THE GIANT PLANET SATURN FILLS THE SCREEN

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Move me not for I will not tell thee

FAUSTUS
Villain have I not bound thee to tell me
anything

SATURN VANISHES They are back in --

INT FAUSTUS’ STUDY

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Ay that is not against our kingdom But this is

The BACK WALL OF FAUSTUS’ STUDY FALLS AWAY
THE FIRES OF HELL appear

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Think thou on hell Faustus for thou art
damned

FAUSTUS

(bawls out in revenge)
Think Faustus upon God that made the world

MEPHISTOPHILIS
(points at the WALL OF FLAME)
Remember this

He walks into the FLAMES
FAUSTUS shouts after him
FAUSTUS
Ay go accursed spirit to ugly hell

Tis thou has damned distressed Faustus’ soul

He turns and runs into the bedroom slamming the door behind him

INT FAUSTUS’ BEDROOM
FAUSTUS stands not knowing what to do next

FAUSTUS
(whispers)
Is’t not too late

The GOOD ANGEL and the EVIL ANGEL appear The GOOD ANGEL
is covered with cobwebs but intact

EVIL ANGEL
Too late

GOOD ANGEL
Never too late if Faustus can repent

EVIL ANGEL
If thou repent devils shall tear thee in pieces

GOOD ANGEL
Repent and they shall never raze thy skin

They disappear

FAUSTUS falls to his knees beside his bed clutching his hands
together in prayer

FAUSTUS
Ah Christ my Saviour
Seek to save distressed FAUSTUS’ soul
A loud knock at the door

FAUSTUS jumps up
In walk LUCIFER and BEELZEBUB They are dressed in beautiful
chalk stripe suits like rich bankers or politicians

LUCIFER is tanned elegant and relaxed the ultimate in suave
experience

BEELZEBUB is his bodyguard He keeps one hand in his pocket

LUCIFER
Christ cannot save thy soul for he is just
There’s none but I have interest in the same

FAUSTUS
Oh who art thou that lookst so terrible

LUCIFER
I am Lucifer
And this is my companion prince in hell

FAUSTUS
(terrified)
Oh Faustus they are come to fetch away thy soul

LUCIFER puts his arm around FAUSTUS’ shoulder He speaks
soothingly

LUCIFER
We come to tell thee thou dost injure us
Thou callst on Christ contrary to thy promise
Thou shouldst not think of God think of the Devil
BEELZEBUB hefts whatever weapon it is he has in his pocket

BEELZEBUB
And of his dam too

BEELZEBUB grins His mouth is full of gold teeth
Suddenly LUCIFER and BEELZEBUB look like gangsters

LUCIFER snaps his fingers

INT FAUSTUS’ STUDY
The THREE appear

MEPHISTOPHILIS arranges TWO THRONES in front of a SMALL
STAGE

Walls and arches have opened up to reveal an infinity of magnificent
rooms

FAUSTUS gapes at the grandeur of his transformed study

FAUSTUS
(trembling subservient)
Nor will I henceforth Pardon me in this
And Faustus vows never to look to heaven
Never to name God or pray to him
To burn his Scriptures slay his ministers
And make my spirits pull his churches down

MEPHISTOPHILIS rolls his eyes

LUCIFER quells him with a look and goes back to soothing
FAUSTUS

LUCIFER
Do so and we will highly gratify thee
Faustus we are come from hell to show thee some
pastime sit down and thou shalt see all the Seven
Deadly Sins appear in their proper shapes

FAUSTUS sits on a throne

FAUSTUS
(fawningly)
That sight will be as pleasing unto me as
paradise was to Adam the first day of his
creation

LUCIFER clears his throat indicating to FAUSTUS that he should
not seat himself before his betters

FAUSTUS jumps up bows low as LUCIFER seats himself

Looking for permission from BEELZEBUB FAUSTUS receives it
and seats himself gingerly on his own throne

LUCIFER
Talk not of paradise or creation but mark this
show talk of the Devil and nothing else
Come away

MEPHISTOPHILIS pulls the red velvet curtain that covers the stage

The TWO DEVILS shine lights on it
BEELZEBUB appears dressed as THE SIN OF PRIDE

LUCIFER
Now Faustus examine them of their several
names and dispositions

FAUSTUS
(eager to be pleased)
What art thou the first

PRIDE
Iam PRIDE I disdain to have parents
But fie what a scent is here I’ll not speak
another word except the ground were
perfumed and covered with cloth of gold

The curtain closes

FAUSTUS
Thou art a proud knave indeed

Curtain opens on BEELZEBUB dressed as COVETOUSNESS

FAUSTUS
What art thou the second

COVETOUSNESS
I am Covetousness begotten of an old churl
in a leather bag and might I now obtain my wish
this house you and all should turn to gold that
I might lock you safe into my chest Oh my
sweet gold

Continue as before The SINS all played by BEELZEBUB surround

him FAUSTUS eager to show his appreciation throughout never

stops laughing and applauding

FAUSTUS
What art thou the third

WRATH

Iam Wrath I had neither father nor mother
I am leaped out of a lion’s mouth when I was
scarce an hour old and ever since I have run
up and down the world with this sword
wounding myself when I had nobody to

fight with I was born in hell and look

to it for some of you shall be my father
FAUSTUS
What art thou the fourth

ENVY
Iam Envy I cannot read and therefore wish
all books were burned I am lean with seeing
others eat Oh that there would come a famine
through all the world that all might die and
I live alone then thou shouldst see how fat
I would be But must thou sit and I stand

FAUSTUS
Away envious rascal What art thou
the fifth

GLUTTONY

Who I sir Iam Gluttony My parents are
all dead and they have left me but a bare
pension that is thirty meals a day and ten
bevvies -- a small trifle to suffice nature
Faustus wilt thou bid me to supper

FAUSTUS pounds his knee laughing
FAUSTUS
No I’ll see thee hanged Thou wilt eat up

all my victuals

GLUTTONY
Then the Devil choke thee

LUCIFER joking makes as if to choke FAUSTUS

FAUSTUS laughs with nervous appreciation

FAUSTUS
Choke thyself glutton What art thou the
sixth

SLOTH

Iam Sloth I was begotten on a sunny
bank where I have lain ever since and
you have done me a great injury to
bring me from thence Ill not speak
another word for a king’s ransom

The CURTAIN shuts and opens again with BEELZEBUB dressed
as a sexy woman -- LECHERY

FAUSTUS
What are you mistress minx the seventh
and the last

LECHERY
(seductively)
Who I sir
(purrs)
The first letter of my name begins with L --
echery

His tongue snakes out
FAUSTUS shouts his approval gives a standing ovation to the show

LUCIFER
Now Faustus how dost thy like this

FAUSTUS
Oh this feeds my soul

BEELZEBUB quivers with excitement at the word ‘soul’
The TWO DEVILS pack away the props
LUCIFER takes FAUSTUS aside for a quick word

LUCIFER
Tut Faustus in hell is all manner of delight

FAUSTUS
Oh that I might see hell and return again
how happy were I then

LUCIFER
Thou shalt I will send for thee at midnight
In meantime take this

He reaches out and MEPHISTOPHILIS hands him yet another
ELECTRONIC TOY which he gives to a grateful FAUSTUS

LUCIFER
peruse it thoroughly and thou shalt
turn thyself into any shape thou wilt

FAUSTUS
Great thanks mighty Lucifer
This I will keep as chary as my life

LUCIFER waves a fond finger at FAUSTUS

LUCIFER
Farewell Faustus and think of the devil

He and BEELZEBUB disappear

FAUSTUS
Farewell great Lucifer

Pause
FAUSTUS and MEPHISTOPHILIS are now alone

FAUSTUS his confidence fully returned draws himself up to full
height and snaps his fingers at MEPHISTOPHILIS

FAUSTUS
Come Mephistophilis

He vanishes

MEPHISTOPHILIS follows

FAUSTUS

Having now my good Mephistophilis
Passed with delight the stately town of Trier
Environed round with airy mountaintops
From Paris next coasting the realm of France
We saw the river Maine fall into Rhine
Whose banks are set with groves of fruitful vines
Then up to Naples rich Campania
With buildings fair and gorgeous to the eye
The streets straight forth and paved with finest brick
From thence to Venice Padua and the rest

(sighs)
Thus hitherto has Faustus spent his time

He plays idly with a SNOWGLOBE as MEPHISTOPHILIS lands
the MOTORCYCLE inside the WALLS OF ST PETER’S CHURCH
in ROME

MEPHISTOPHILIS dismounts FAUSTUS gets up and stretches

FAUSTUS
Tell me now what resting place is this
Hast thou as erst I did command
Conducted me within the walls of Rome

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Faustus I have
This is the goodly palace of the Pope
And ‘cause we are no common guests
I choose his privy chamber for our use

I hope his holiness will bid us welcome

FAUSTUS
I swear
That I do long to see the monuments
And situation of bright-splendent Rome

FAUSTUS tugs at MEPHISTOPHILIS’ sleeve

FAUSTUS
Come therefore let’s away

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Nay stay my Faustus I know you’d see the Pope
And take some part of Holy Peter’s Feast
Where thou shalt see a troop of bald-pate friars
Whose highest goodness is in belly-cheer
He produces a CONE of PINK CANDY FLOSS and hands it to
FAUSTUS

FAUSTUS takes it turns his baseball cap backwards and nods

FAUSTUS
Well Iam content to compass then some sport
And by their folly make us merriment
Then charm me that I may be invisible to do what I
please unseen of any whilst I stay in Rome

MEPHISTOPHILIS waves his hand FAUSTUS disappears leaving
only the CANDY FLOSS floating in the air

MEPHISTOPHILIS
So Faustus now do what thou wilt thou

shalt not be discerned

He indicates that FAUSTUS should toss the CANDY FLOSS away
FAUSTUS does

With a flourish MEPHISTOPHILIS throws open a huge door

As we that do succeed or they that shall
Hereafter possess our throne shall
I fear me never attain to that degree
Of high renown and great authority

The COURT murmurs “no no” and praise for the modesty of
the EMPEROR

FAUSTUS and MEPHISTOPHILIS bow again

EMPEROR
Amongst which kings is ALEXANDER THE GREAT

The COURT applauds this with extra enthusiasm

EMPEROR
Chief spectacle of the world’s pre-eminence
The bright shining of whose glorious acts
Lightens the world with his reflecting beams --
As when I hear but mention made of him
It grieves my soul I never saw the man

The COURT murmurs with sympathy

It is indeed very sad that their EMPEROR never met ALEXANDER
THE GREAT

The EMPEROR holds his hand up one more time for silence

EMPEROR
If therefore by the cunning of thy art
Canst raise this man from hollow vaults below
Where lies entombed this famous conqueror
And bring with him his beauteous paramour

The COURT buzzes with excitement

EMPEROR
Both in their right shapes gestures and attire
They used to wear during their time of life
Thou shalt both satisfy my just desire
And give me cause to praise thee while I live

Even more APPLAUSE It dies down and the COURT waits
expectant for FAUSTUS’ REPLY

He does not disappoint them

FAUSTUS
My gracious lord I am ready to accomplish
your request so far forth as by art and power
of my spirit Iam able to perform

He pauses dramatically

FAUSTUS
But if it like your Grace it is not in my
ability to present before your eyes the true
substantial bodies of those deceased princes
which are long since consumed to dust
Disappointed murmurs from the COURT
The EMPEROR and EMPRESS look concerned

FAUSTUS
(in ringing tones)
BUT SUCH SPIRITS AS CAN RESEMBLE
ALEXANDER AND HIS PARAMOUR SHALL
APPEAR BEFORE YOUR GRACE IN THAT

MANNER THAT THEY BEST LIVED IN IN
THEIR MOST FLOURISHING ESTATE

The COURT laughs APPLAUDS
The EMPEROR and EMPRESS beam and applaud
FAUSTUS
(continues more modestly)
Which I doubt not shall sufficiently content

your Imperial Majesty

EMPEROR
Go to Master Doctor let me see them presently

FAUSTUS
(with a dramatic gesture)
Mephistophilis be gone
MEPHISTOPHILIS vanishes
The COURT GASPS
Pause All that can be heard is the GIANT CLOCK TICKING
Then BEAUTIFUL MUSIC fills the hall

All look around for its mysterious source

And MEPHISTOPHILIS reappears and with a sweeping gesture
introduces the TWO SPIRITS who materialize in front of him

ALEXANDER THE GREAT and his paramour ROXANA

The EMPRESS delighted at this clasps her hands in excitement

The COURT amazed applauds

ALEXANDER THE GREAT and ROXANA parade up and down
the hall

The EMPEROR greatly impressed rises from his throne and escorts

the EMPRESS down to a place closer to the SPIRITS

EMPEROR
Master Doctor I heard this lady while she
lived had a wart or mole on her neck How
shall I know whether it be so or not

FAUSTUS
(with great showmanship)
Your Highness may boldly go and see

The EMPEROR hesitates but the EMPRESS urges him on

He goes to the spirit ROXANA and pulls back her hair
He falls back amazed
The EMPRESS leads the COURT in APPLAUSE

EMPEROR
Sure these are no spirits but the true
substantial bodies of those two deceased
princes

FAUSTUS claps his hands and ALEXANDER THE GREAT
and ROXANA pause for one last wave to the COURT

Then they shimmer dissolve and disappear
WILD APPLAUSE
The EMPEROR goes to FAUSTUS embraces him
EMPEROR
Believe me Master Doctor this merriment

hath much pleased me Expect a bounteous
reward

This is FAUSTUS’ apotheosis But he is not finished yet

FAUSTUS
My gracious lord I am glad it contents you
so well

He turns to the EMPRESS who still giddily applauds him
FAUSTUS

But it may be madam that you take no delight
in this
The EMPEROR and the COURT laugh at this witticism

FAUSTUS
Therefore I pray you tell me what is the
thing you most desire to have Be it in
the world it shall be yours I have heard
that great-bellied women do long for things
that are rare and dainty

EMPRESS
Thanks good Master Doctor And for I
see your courteous intent to pleasure me
I will not hide from you the thing my heart
desires And were it now summer as it is
January and the dead time of winter I
would desire no better meat than a dish
of ripe grapes

FAUSTUS
Alas madam that’s nothing
(with GESTURE)
Mephistophilis be gone

MEPHISTOPHILIS exits with a whoosh and reappears immediately

holding a PLANT POT and STICK

He gives the STICK to FAUSTUS who displays it to the COURT
and then with many mysterious gestures sticks it in the dirt of the

PLANT POT

He waves his hand The STICK bursts into a GRAPEVINE that grows

and spills out of the PLANT POT into the hall

GRAPES appear growing in cascades down the vine

As the COURT watches enthralled the GRAPES ripen

More APPLAUSE The EMPEROR is delighted

FAUSTUS picks the finest bunch of GRAPES and with a flourish

offers them to the EMPRESS

FAUSTUS
How do you like them madam
Be they good

EMPRESS
Believe me Master Doctor they be the best
grapes that e’er I tasted in my life before

FAUSTUS
I am glad they content you so madam

EMPEROR
(to the EMPRESS)
Come madam let us in
Where you must well reward this learned man
For the great kindness he hath showed to you

EMPRESS
And so I will my lord and whilst I live
Rest beholding for this courtesy

FAUSTUS
(bowing)
I humbly thank your Majesty

EMPRESS
Come Master Doctor follow us and receive
your reward

FAUSTUS follows the EMPEROR and EMPRESS up the thrones
where COURTIERS appear staggering under lavish gifts

As the CAMERA CREWS film the COURTIERS heap these upon
FAUSTUS filling his BACK PACK to overflowing

Waves and waves of applause FAUSTUS bows over and over again
TILT UP TO THE CLOCK ABOVE THE THRONE
It ticks away Hands set at 1 o’clock
As the IMAGE OF THE CLOCK DISSOLVES --
ANOTHER HUGE CLOCK APPEARS IN ITS PLACE
The REPORTER’S VOICE is heard
REPORTER’S VOICE

When Faustus had with pleasure ta’en the view

Of rarest things and royal courts of kings

He stayed his course and so returned home
TILT DOWN - TO REVEAL A SINGLE THRONE UNDER THE CLOCK

FAUSTUS sits there alone He has aged twenty years or more

PULL BACK TO REVEAL --

The luxury of the palace hall SOUVENIRS and TREASURES
from around the world litter every surface

This is FAUSTUS’ PALACE Even grander than that of the
EMPEROR

A BANQUET TABLE laden with lavish food and drink indicate that
GUESTS are expected

MEPHISTOPHILIS stands by the door
The REPORTER microphone in hand moves into frame
REPORTER
Where such as bear his absence but with grief --
I mean his friends and nearest companions --

Did gratulate his safety with kind words

FAUSTUS inclines his head and MEPHISTOPHILIS throws open
the door

SCHOLAR 1 SCHOLAR 2 SCHOLAR 3 CORNELIUS and
VALDES enter exclaim with wonder at the palace as the CAMERA
CREW films their reactions

They investigate the contents of the hall amazed

None are older than when we saw them last

The SCHOLARS astonished at the change in FAUSTUS murmur
about this among themselves

FAUSTUS comes down from his throne to greet his guests

PAN UP TO THE CLOCK - THE HANDS MOVE FAST THROUGH
THE HOUR

PAN DOWN TO THE GREAT HALL

The REPORTER continues her broadcast in the FOREGROUND
Behind her -- FAUSTUS entertains his GUESTS through a multi-

course meal with his learning and wit All in SPEEDED-UP
MOTION

REPORTER
And in their conference of what befell
Touching his journey through the world and air
They put forth questions of astrology
Which Faustus answered with such learned skill
As they admired and wondered at his wit

FAUSTUS makes a pronouncement the GUESTS applaud
MEPHISTOPHILIS passes the port

The SCHOLARS confer among themselves goad SCHOLAR 1 to
make a request

SCHOLAR 1
(clears his throat nervously)
Master Doctor Faustus since our conference
about fair ladies which was the beautifullest
in all the world we have determined with
ourselves that Helen of Greece was the
admirablest lady that ever lived

SCHOLAR 2
Therefore Master Doctor if you will do us that
favour as to let us see that peerless dame
of Greece whom all the world admires for

majesty
SCHOLAR 3
we should think ourselves much beholden unto
you
FAUSTUS
Friends

For that I know your friendship is unfeigned
And FAUSTUS’ custom is not to deny

The just requests of those that wish him well
You shall behold that peerless dame of Greece
No otherways for pomp and majesty

Than when Sir Paris crossed the seas with her
And brought the spoils to rich

FAUSTUS’ flow of eloquence suddenly fails him He can’t remember
what he was going to say

MEPHISTOPHILIS passing by prompts him

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Dardania

FAUSTUS
And brought the spoils to rich DARDANIA

SCHOLARS and CORNELIUS and VALDES ooh and aaah

FAUSTUS gestures to MEPHISTOPHILIS who goes up to the throne’s
dais and pulls a WARDROBE onto CENTRE STAGE

Music sounds

FAUSTUS
(to his GUESTS)
Be silent then for danger is in words

All watch

MEPHISTOPHILIS dressed as a MAGICIAN pulls out a TOP HAT
dons it

With a gesture he flings open the WARDROBE DOOR
It is empty

He shuts the wardrobe and makes a pass with his hands in front
of it

He opens the wardrobe
HELEN OF TROY steps from it
The GUESTS gasp as MEPHISTOPHILIS helps her down

Wearing a spangled tutu she pirouettes HELEN OF TROY is indeed
beautiful

SCHOLAR 2
Too simple is my wit to tell her praise
Whom all the world admires for majesty

SCHOLAR 3
No marvel through the angry Greeks pursued
With ten years’ war the rape of such a queen

SCHOLAR 1
Whose heavenly beauty passeth all compare

From his TOP HAT MEPHISTOPHILIS produces ROSES and WHITE
DOVES which float around HELEN

As the GUESTS watch amazed MEPHISTOPHILIS turns the
WARDROBE on its side It becomes a COFFIN He helps HELEN
into this Shows her feet extending from one end her head from the
other

Producing a SAW MEPHISTOPHILIS SAWS HELEN IN HALF

He opens the hinged coffin to show the EMPTY SPACE between her
two halves

Puts the halves together again Waves a hand Opens the coffin

And HELEN OF TROY jumps out whole and more beautiful than
ever

She bows to the GUESTS

TILT UP TO THE CLOCK - as we hear the ‘ooooohs’ and ‘aaaaaahs’
of the GUESTS

THE CLOCK HANDS MOVE FORWARD

TILT DOWN TO THE HALL

FAUSTUS says goodbye to his GUESTS

As they leave MEPHISTOPHILIS hands them their coats

CORNELIUS
Since we have seen the pride of Nature’s works

VALDES
And only paragon of excellence

CORNELIUS
Let us depart and for this glorious deed

ALL
Happy and blessed be Faustus evermore

FAUSTUS
Good friends farewell the same I wish to you

The GUESTS depart

FAUSTUS looks at the empty hall
MEPHISTOPHILIS watches him concerned He lights a cigarette
smokes as FAUSTUS walks heavily to his throne

FAUSTUS expressionless sits on the throne
The only sound is the ‘TICK TICK TICK’ of the clock

FAUSTUS restless can’t settle He gets up from the throne
Goes to where the magic show took place Picks up a SPANGLE
dropped from Helen’s tutu puts it in his pocket

Tick Tick Tick

He takes a turn looking at his SOUVENIRS and TREASURES

A huge collection of SNOW SCENES a TREE of BASEBALL CAPS
CALCULATORS ANTIQUE ABACUSES SLIDE RULES MOBILE
PHONES GLOBAL POSITIONING DEVICES etc

Tick Tick Tick

Finally he can’t stand it anymore Picking up his BACKPACK
he goes to the door

MEPHISTOPHILIS looks a question

FAUSTUS

Now Mephistophilis the restless course
That time doth run with calm and silent foot
Short’ning my days and thread of vital life
Calls for the payment of my latest years

(pause)
Therefore sweet Mephistophilis let us make haste
To Wittenberg

He goes out

MEPHISTOPHILIS stubs out his cigarette and follows

EXT A SUNNY ROAD LEADING FROM THE PALACE
FAUSTUS trudges along it

It is a bright sunny day
The way is lined with a field of wildflowers

MEPHISTOPHILIS jogs to catch up with FAUSTUS

MEPHISTOPHILIS
What will you go on horseback or on foot

FAUSTUS
Nay till I am past this fair and pleasant green
Il walk on foot

FAUSTUS goes on leaving MEPHISTOPHILIS behind
A FOG comes up hiding the PALACE and MEPHISTOPHILIS
from view

FAUSTUS trudges on carrying his backpack

FARTHER ON THE ROAD

The road now follows a RIVER FAUSTUS continues on
UP AHEAD - THE CLOCK TOWER OF WITTENBERG

It chimes FIVE O’CLOCK

FAUSTUS stops looks at the CLOCK

FAUSTUS
(mutters)
What art thou Faustus but a man condemn’d to die
Thy fatal time doth draw to final end
Despair doth drive distrust into my thoughts

He stretches himself out on the grass by the river

FAUSTUS
Confound these passions with a quiet sleep
Tush Christ did call the thief upon the Cross
Then rest thee Faustus quiet in conceit

He closes his eyes dozes The SOUND OF CICADAS fills the air
And then - the CLOCK OF WITTENBERG STRIKES SIX

CHURCH BELLS call worshippers to chapel

FAUSTUS
(wakes with a start)
What What

Sitting up he sees that he is not alone
The Rector of his College -- the OLD MAN -- stands there dressed
for a country walk staff in hand

He has been watching FAUSTUS sleep
For a moment they stare at each other

OLD MAN
Ah Doctor Faustus that I might prevail
To guide thy steps unto the way of life
By which sweet path thou mayst attain the goal
That shall conduct thee to celestial rest
Break heart drop blood and mingle it with tears --
Tears falling from repentant heaviness
Of thy most vile and loathsome filthiness
The stench whereof corrupts the inward soul
With such flagitious crimes of heinous sins
As no commiserations may expel
But mercy Faustus of thy Saviour sweet
Whose blood alone must wash away thy guilt

FAUSTUS leaps up confused
FAUSTUS
Where art thou Faustus Wretch what hast thou done
Damned art thou Faustus damned Despair and die

The SOUND OF ROARING MOTORCYCLES

In the FOREGROUND - the TWO DEVILS ride MOTORCYCLES
past

They ROAR away revealing MEPHISTOPHILIS now standing
behind FAUSTUS He hands FAUSTUS a KNIFE

FAUSTUS
Hell calls for right and with a roaring voice
Says “Faustus come Thine hour is come”
FAUSTUS rushes at the OLD MAN KNIFE aimed at his chest
MEPHISTOPHILIS disappears

FAUSTUS
And Faustus will come to do thee right

The OLD MAN wrestles with him FAUSTUS slips in the mud of
the bank falls into the RIVER

Blubbering he thrashes around in the weeds

The OLD MAN comes to the river’s edge retrieves the KNIFE from the
weeds tosses it into the river and helps FAUSTUS from the mud

OLD MAN
Ah stay good Faustus stay thy desperate steps
I see an angel hovers o’er thy head
And with a vial full of precious grace
Offers to pour the same into thy soul
Then call for mercy and avoid despair

FAUSTUS falls on the OLD MAN sobbing on his shoulder

OVER THE OLD MAN’S SHOULDER - he sees MEPHISTOPHILIS
in motorcycle leathers with their MOTORCYCLE and SIDECAR

MEPHISTOPHILIS grim beckons to FAUSTUS

FAUSTUS
(nervously)
Ah my sweet friend I feel thy words
To comfort my distressed soul
Leave me awhile to ponder on my sins

FAUSTUS goes to MEPHISTOPHILIS gets in the sidecar

OLD MAN watches this FAUSTUS avoids the OLD MAN’S eye
He takes a helmet from MEPHISTOPHILIS

OLD MAN
I go sweet Faustus but with heavy cheer
Fearing the ruin of thy hopeless soul

He turns and walks back toward the CHURCH BELLS of Wittenberg

FAUSTUS
Accursed Faustus where is mercy now
I do repent and yet I do despair
Hell strives with grace for conquest in my breast
What shall I do to shun the snares of death

MEPHISTOPHILIS guns the motorcycle
MEPHISTOPHILIS
Thou traitor Faustus I arrest thy soul

For disobedience to my sovereign lord

They vanish

EXT ON THE MOTORCYCLE

It goes so fast the landscape is a blur

MEPHISTOPHILIS and FAUSTUS shout over the roar of the engine

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Revolt or I’ll piecemeal tear thy flesh

FAUSTUS
Sweet Mephistophilis entreat thy lord
To pardon my unjust presumption
And with my blood again I will confirm
My former vow I made to Lucifer

The motorcycle screeches to a halt in front of --

EXT WITTENBERG CHURCH
PARISHIONERS and SCHOLARS etc going in to the service

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Do it then quickly with unfeigned heart
Lest greater danger do attend thy drift

The OLD MAN appears prayer book in hand

FAUSTUS
(points at him)
Torment sweet friend that base and crooked age
That durst dissuade me from thy Lucifer
With greatest torments that our hell affords

MEPHISTOPHILIS
His faith is great I cannot touch his soul
But what I may afflict his body with
I will attempt which is but little worth

The TWO LEATHER CLAD DEVILS appear advance on the OLD MAN

OLD MAN
Accursed Faustus miserable man
That from thy soul excludest the grace of heaven
And flies the throne of his tribunal seat

The DEVILS produce SWITCHBLADES which they flip open in
unison

The CHURCH BELLS sound The DEVILS fall back confused

OLD MAN
(with contempt)
Ambitious fiends see how the heavens smile
At your repulse and laughs your state to scorn
Hence hell For hence I fly unto my God

He goes into the church

INT FAUSTUS’ STUDY

FAUSTUS feverish once again cuts his wrist and with the blood
signs a renewed bond

MEPHISTOPHILIS takes it begins to dematerialise

FAUSTUS
One thing good servant let me crave of thee

MEPHISTOPHILIS reappears

FAUSTUS
To glut the longing of my heart’s desire
That I might have unto my paramour
That heavenly Helen which I saw of late
Whose sweet embracings may extinguish clean
These thoughts that I do dissuade me from my vow
And keep mine oath I made to Lucifer

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Faustus this or what else thou shalt desire

Shall be performed in twinkling of an eye

THE BACK WALL OF THE STUDY DISSOLVES INTO THE NIGHT
TIME SKY

And a NEBULA OF STARS swirls moves closer and closer until --
HELEN OF TROY steps from it into the room
She is dressed in STARS AND SKY

She walks to FAUSTUS

FAUSTUS
Was this the face that launched a thousand ships
And burnt the topless towers of Ilium
Sweet Helen make me immortal with a kiss

They kiss
HELEN draws FAUSTUS’ BREATH into hers

A WHITE MOTH flies from FAUSTUS’ MOUTH which she catches in
one hand

FAUSTUS
Her lips suck forth my soul -- see where it flies
Come Helen come give me my soul again

She teases him holding his soul away in her hand nuzzling his neck
He laughs delighted with her pretty ways

FAUSTUS
Here will I dwell for heaven is in these lips
And all is dross that is not Helena

He takes her in his arms again

FAUSTUS
I will be Paris and for love of thee
Instead of Troy shall Wittenberg be sacked
And I will combat with weak Menelaus
And wear thy colours on my plumed crest
Yea I will wound Achilles in the heel
And then return to Helen for a kiss
O thou art fairer than the evening air
Clad in the beauty of a thousand stars
Brighter art thou than flaming Jupiter
When he appeared to hapless Semele
More lovely than the monarch of the sky
In wanton Arethusa’s azured arms
And none but thou shalt be my paramour

He sweeps her up in his arms and carries her through to what is
now a PALATIAL BEDROOM

As they disappear she opens her hand

The WHITE MOTH flutters back into the room

MEPHISTOPHILIS holds an open jar and catches the MOTH

He screws down the lid and observes it fluttering

INT FAUSTUS’ STUDY - LATER - DAY

The room is empty The windows open The curtains flutter A low
rumble of thunder

MRS WAGNER enters from the bedroom She carries a load of dirty
sheets As she goes out she notices the GLOW OF THE COMPUTER
SCREEN

She stops and reads what’s there

It is THE LAST WILL OF JOHN FAUSTUS

She gives a little shriek hurries out of the room

INT COLLEGE CLOISTERS

MRS WAGNER hurries down them agitated THUNDER AND
LIGHTNING from outside

She runs into SCHOLAR 1 SCHOLAR 2 and SCHOLAR 3
MRS WAGNER
(breathless)
I think my master means to die shortly
He has made his will and given me his wealth
His house his goods and stores of golden plate
Besides two thousand ducats ready coined
I wonder what he means

The SCHOLARS concerned question MRS WAGNER
The THUNDER drowns out their words

CUT TO --

INT A LIFT
LUCIFER BEELZEBUB and MEPHISTOPHILIS ascend in the lift

BEELZEBUB adjusts his tie in the lift door reflection

MEPHISTOPHILIS clears his throat

LUCIFER
Thus from infernal Dis do we ascend
To view the subjects of our monarchy

Ding The doors open

INT FAUSTUS’ STUDY
The THREE emerge into the room

LUCIFER
Those souls which sin seals the black sons of hell
‘Mongst which as chief Faustus we come to thee
Bringing with us lasting damnation
To wait upon thy soul The time is come
Which makes it forfeit

MEPHISTOPHILIS
(turns on a light)
And this gloomy night
Here in this room will wretched Faustus be

He looks at the computer terminal reads what’s there Shakes his
head closes the file

BEELZEBUB
And here well stay
To mark him how he doth demean himself

MEPHISTOPHILIS
How should he but in desperate lunacy
Fond worldling now his heart-blood dries with grief
His conscience kills it and his labouring brain
Begets a world of idle fantasies
To overreach the devil But all in vain
His store of pleasures must be sauced in pain

VOICES approach
MEPHISTOPHILIS
He and his servant Wagner are at hand

See where they come

LUCIFER makes a sign The THREE DEVILS disappear
FAUSTUS and MRS WAGNER enter

FAUSTUS
Say Wagner thou has perused my will
How dost thou like it

MRS WAGNER
(nervously)
Sir so wondrous well
As in all humble duty I do yield
My life and lasting service for your love

The SCHOLARS enter

WAGNER welcomes them with relief

SCHOLAR 1 gestures to her not to worry She goes out

FAUSTUS goes to the window shuts it against the rain
OUT THE WINDOW - THE CLOCK TOWER
The HANDS OF THE CLOCK are at 1045

AT FAUSTUS - he freezes at this sight Then recovering
turns back to the SCHOLARS

FAUSTUS
Welcome welcome
SCHOLAR 1
(concerned)
Now worthy Faustus methinks your looks are
changed
FAUSTUS
(groans)
Oh
SCHOLAR 2

What ails Faustus

FAUSTUS
Ah my sweet friends Had I lived with thee
then had I lived still but now must die
eternally

In the corner of the room the dim outline of LUCIFER BEELZEBUB
and MEPHISTOPHILIS shimmers

Only FAUSTUS sees

FAUSTUS
(points)
Look there comes he not Comes he not

SCHOLAR 1
Oh my dear Faustus what imports this fear

SCHOLAR 2
Is all our pleasure turned to melancholy

SCHOLAR 3
(to other SCHOLARS)
He is not well with being over-solitary

SCHOLAR 2
If it be so well have physicians and Faustus
shall be cured

SCHOLAR 3
(to FAUSTUS)
Tis but a surfeit sir Fear nothing

FAUSTUS
A surfeit of deadly sin that hath damned
both body and soul

SCHOLAR 2
Yet Faustus look up to heaven and remember
God’s mercy is infinite

BEHIND THEM - THE REPORTER and CREW sneak into the room
WAGNER lets them in pocketing a tenner

FAUSTUS notes them

FAUSTUS
But FAUSTUS’ offence can ne’er be pardoned
The serpent that tempted Eve may be saved
but not Faustus Oh friends hear with patience
and tremble not at my speeches Though my
heart pant and quiver to remember that I have
been a student here these thirty years

The SCHOLARS see the TV CREW and arrange their EXPRESSIONS
accordingly

FAUSTUS
Oh would that I had never seen Wittenberg
never read book And what wonders I have done
all Germany can witness yea all the world yea
heaven itself -- heaven the seat of God the throne
of the blessed the kingdom of joy -- and must
remain in hell forever Hell oh hell forever
Sweet friends what shall become of Faustus
being in hell forever

ANGLE ON THE DEVILS

LUCIFER nods smiling BEELZEBUB checks the messages on his
mobile MEPHISTOPHILIS smokes

SCHOLAR 2
Yet Faustus call on God

FAUSTUS
On God whom Faustus hath abjured
On God whom Faustus hath blasphemed
Oh my God I would weep but the devil
draws in my tears

He points accusingly at MEPHISTOPHILIS who bored takes another
drag on his cigarette

The SCHOLARS look wonderingly at what seems to them to be an
empty corner of the room

The TV CREW’S MONITOR shows nothing there
FAUSTUS

Gush forth blood instead of tears

yea life and soul Oh he stays my

tongue I would lift up my hands

but see they hold ‘em they hold ‘em
MEPHISTOPHILIS is disgusted by this obvious lie
He flicks his cigarette at FAUSTUS

FAUSTUS ducks to avoid it The SCHOLARS are startled

SCHOLAR 3
Who Faustus

FAUSTUS
Why Lucifer and Mephistophilis Oh friends
I gave them my soul for my cunning

SCHOLAR 2
Oh God forbid

FAUSTUS
God forbade it indeed but Faustus hath
done it For the vain pleasure of four-and-
twenty years hath Faustus lost eternal joy
and felicity I writ them a bill with mine own
blood The date is expired This is the time
and he will fetch me

The REPORTER thrusts her microphone at FAUSTUS

REPORTER
Why did not Faustus tell us of this before
that the divines might have prayed for thee

FAUSTUS
Oft have I thought to have done so but the
devil threatened to tear me to pieces if
I named God to fetch me body and soul
if I once gave ear to divinity

MEPHISTOPHILIS shakes his head at this grandstanding
He checks his watch

LUCIFER puts a soothing hand on his arm Soon enough
FAUSTUS watches them with dread
FAUSTUS
And now ‘tis too late Friends away lest you
perish with me

The SCHOLARS preen before the TELEVISION CREW

SCHOLAR 2
Oh what may we do to save Faustus
FAUSTUS
Talk not of me but save yourselves and depart

SCHOLAR 3
(to TV CAMERA)
God will strengthen me I will stay with Faustus

SCHOLAR 1
(also to TV CAMERA)
Tempt not God sweet friend but let us
into the next room and pray for him

FAUSTUS
Ay pray for me pray for me And what noise
soever you hear come not unto me for nothing
can rescue me

THE TV CREW packs up and leaves
SCHOLAR 1 hurries the others away

FAUSTUS
Friends farewell If I live till morning
Ill visit you If not Faustus is gone to hell

The SCHOLARS call back as they close the door

SCHOLARS
Faustus farewell

Pause
The sound of clapping

MEPHISTOPHILIS walks forward as he and the other DEVILS
completely materialize

He applauds FAUSTUS’ performance

MEPHISTOPHILIS
Ay Faustus now thou hast no hope of heaven
Therefore despair Think only upon hell
For that must be thy mansion there to dwell

FAUSTUS
Oh thou bewitching fiend ‘twas thy temptation
Hath robbed me of eternal happiness

MEPHISTOPHILIS
I do confess it Faustus and rejoice

‘Twas I that when thou wert on the way to heaven
Dammed up thy passage When thou took’st the book

To view the Scriptures then I turned the leaves
And led thine eye

LUCIFER checks his own watch indicates that they must be
moving on

MEPHISTOPHILIS joins the other DEVILS

MEPHISTOPHILIS
(to FAUSTUS)

What weep’st thou ‘Tis too late Despair farewell
Fools that will laugh on earth must weep in hell

The sound of a lift merges with the roar of motorcycles
They are gone

Pause

FAUSTUS looks around wildly for some way to escape

The GOOD ANGEL and the BAD ANGEL appear at opposite sides
of the room

GOOD ANGEL
Oh Faustus if thou hadst given ear to me
Innumerable joys had followed thee
But thou didst love the world

BAD ANGEL
Gave ear to me
And now must taste hell’s pains perpetually

GOOD ANGEL
Oh what will all thy riches pleasures pomps
Avail thee now

BAD ANGEL
Nothing but vex thee more
To want in hell that had on earth such store

Kissing his fingers to FAUSTUS MEPHISTOPHILIS follows LUCIFER
and BEELZEBUB into the back wall of the study
The BACK WALL OF THE STUDY dissolves into a SCENE OF
WOODLAND PEACE Birds call A breeze ruffles the scene

GOOD ANGEL
Oh thou hast lost celestial happiness
Pleasures unspeakable bliss without end
Hadst thou affected sweet divinity
Hell or the devil had had no power on thee
That thou hast lost

The SOUND OF CRACKLING FLAMES

GOOD ANGEL
And now poor soul must thy good angel leave thee
The jaws of hell are open to receive thee

The GOOD ANGEL vanishes
FLAMES LICK UP COVERING THE WOODLAND SCENE
The SCREAMS OF THE DAMNED come from the FIRE

BAD ANGEL
Now Faustus let thine eyes with horror stare
Into that vast perpetual torture-house
There are the Furies tossing damned souls
On burning forks their bodies boil in lead
There are live quarters broiling on the coals
That ne’er can die This ever-burning chair
Is for o’er tortured souls to rest them in
These that are fed with sops of flaming fire
Were gluttons and loved only delicates
And laughed to see the poor starve at their gates
But yet all these are nothing Thou shalt see
Ten thousand tortures that more horrid be

FAUSTUS
Oh I have seen enough to torture me

BAD ANGEL
Nay thou must feel them taste the smart of all
He that loves pleasure must for pleasure fall

FAUSTUS rushes at the SPIDER and tries to crush it
The BAD ANGEL scuttles away

BAD ANGEL
And so I leave thee Faustus till anon
Then wilt thou tumble into confusion

It vanishes

The FLAMES and TORTURES OF THE DAMNED fade away
leaving the study as before

FAUSTUS is alone
Pause
The CLOCK STRIKES ELEVEN

FAUSTUS
Oh Faustus

He closes his eyes He can’t go on He sits then unable to settle
gets up and moves aimlessly around

The room seems smaller than before

FAUSTUS
Now hast thou but one bare hour to live
And then thou must be damned perpetually
Stand still you ever-moving spheres of heaven
That time may cease and midnight never come
Fair nature’s eye rise rise again and make
Perpetual day or let this hour be but
A year a month a week a natural day
That Faustus may repent and save his soul
Oh run slowly slowly horses of the night

Pause He shudders

FAUSTUS
The stars move still time runs the clock will strike
The devil will come and Faustus must be damned
Oh Ill leap up to heaven Who pulls me down
See see where Christ’s blood streams in the firmament
One drop would save my soul half a drop
Ah my Christ

He looks around afraid of being overheard

FAUSTUS
(whispers)
Rend not my heart for naming of my Christ
Yet will I call on him
(full voice)
Oh spare me Lucifer (CONT)

FAUSTUS (CONT)
Where is it now ‘Tis gone
And see a threat’ning arm an angry brow
Mountains and hills come come and fall on me
And hide me from the heavy wrath of God No
No Then will I headlong run into the earth
Gape earth Oh no it will not harbour me
You stars that reigned at my nativity
Whose influence hath allotted death and hell
Now draw up Faustus like a foggy mist
Into the entrails of yon labouring cloud
That when you vomit forth into the air
My limbs may issue from your smoky mouths
But let my soul mount and ascend to heaven

THE CLOCK STRIKES THE HALF HOUR
The ROOM shrinks smaller still

FAUSTUS
Oh half the hour is past ‘Twill all be past anon
Oh if my soul must suffer for my sin
Impose some end to my incessant pain
Let Faustus live in hell a thousand years
A hundred thousand and at last be saved
No end is limited to damned souls
Why wert thou not a creature wanting soul
Or why is this immortal that thou hast
This soul should fly from me and I be changed
Into some brutish beast
All beasts are happy for when they die
Their souls are soon dissolved in the elements
But mine must live still to be plagued in hell
Curst be the parents that engendered me
No Faustus curse thyself Curse Lucifer
That hath deprived thee of the joys of heaven

THE FLAMES CRACKLE UP THE BACK WALL OF THE STUDY
THE CLOCK STRIKES TWELVE
The room is now claustrophobically small

FAUSTUS
It strikes it strikes Now body turn to air
Or Lucifer will bear thee quick to hell
Oh soul be changed into little water drops
And fall into the ocean ne’er be found
HELL ENTERS THE ROOM
They surround FAUSTUS with a RING OF BLACK CLOTH
FAUSTUS
Oh mercy heaven look not so fierce on me

Adders and serpents let me breathe awhile

The DEVILS wrap him tightly in the BLACK CLOTH
FAUSTUS claws at it as it covers his face

Lifting him as if he were a coffin the DEVILS carry FAUSTUS into
HELL

FAUSTUS twitches and smothers in the black cloth
FAUSTUS
(frees his mouth gasping)
Ugly hell gape not Come not Lucifer
Ill burn my books Oh Mephistophilis

MEPHISTOPHILIS pulls the cloth back tight over his mouth
cutting him off

The room goes up in flames

And dissolves And disappears

CHURCH BELLS RING

EXT COLLEGE QUADRANGLE - DAY

FUNERAL PROCESSION The SCHOLARS walk the COFFIN to
a waiting HEARSE

INT FAUSTUS’ STUDY

The room is empty

The COMPUTER TERMINAL glows

CHURCH BELLS continue

The DOOR opens The REPORTER and TV CREW enter to film
one last segment

REPORTER
(with microphone to CAMERA)
Oh such a dreadful night was never seen
Since first the world’s creation did begin
Such fearful shrieks and cries were never heard

The TV PRODUCER gestures to the REPORTER points to a corner
of the room

REPORTER
(looking around)

The devils whom Faustus served had torn him thus

Sees the OLD MAN who stands at the FIREPLACE in the corner
burning FAUSTUS’ MAGIC PAPERS and BOOKS

The REPORTER and TV CREW creep out the same way they came
PAUSE

The fire crackles

Finished the OLD MAN goes to the COMPUTER

ON THE SCREEN - a SMALL FIGURE runs back and forth shouting
silently

It is FAUSTUS trapped in the computer He shouts and shouts
but no one hears

OLD MAN
Cut is the branch that might have grown full straight
And burned is Apollo’s laurel bough
That sometime grew within this learned man
FAUSTUS howls his face contorted
ON THE SCREEN - A COMPUTER ERROR MESSAGE

“YOU HAVE PERFORMED AN ILLEGAL FUNCTION
THIS PROGRAM WILL NOW BE SHUT DOWN”

The OLD MAN shuts the computer off
FAUSTUS disappears in mid-scream

The CHURCH BELLS ring Wind blows through the open window

The OLD MAN turns to address us

OLD MAN
Faustus is gone Regard his hellish fall
Whose fiendish fortune may exhort the wise
Only to wonder at unlawful things
Whose deepness doth entice such forward wits
To practice more than heavenly power permits

He takes a DVD from the COMPUTER and pockets it

He goes out the door closing it behind him

THE END
