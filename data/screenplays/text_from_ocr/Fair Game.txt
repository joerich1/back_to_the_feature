INT CONFERENCE ROOM DIRECTORATE OF INTELLIGENCE DAY

Several analysts sit around a table including the LEAD
ANALYST PAUL Two of them are the guys who were bad-

Valerie Another is JOE TURNER a dough-faced offical from
WINPAC (Weapons Intelligence Non Proliferaton and Control)

TURNER
(Reads )
In summer 2001 Iraq sought to
purchase 60000 high alloy 7075-T4
aluminum tubes manufactured in
China The high spec of these tubes
led us to conclude they were
intended for the enrichment of
uranium In August 2001 J
Turner Thats me flew to
Vienna to meet with IAEA
scientists Mr Turner produced
this report aspects of which
represents the CIAs present
position Im happy to take
questions

ANALYST
he INR concluded late last year
hat these tubes were probably for
rtillery use and the DOE agreed
hey exactly matched those used by
raq for artillery rockets

Hde dy

PAUL
Where are the tubes

TURNER

WINPAC has them Weve examined
them This is my point None of you
guys has even seen the tubes

VALERIE
Ive seen them

Everyone looks at her

TURNER
And when was that

Valerie looks up Slightly surprised by his tone

VALERIE
When I seized them last year in
Jordan When I headed the covert
team that intercepted them bought
back samples and delivered them to
you guys at WINPAC

A couple of the analysts try not to smile

TURNER
So I take it youre not a nuclear
expert These tubes are an EXACT
match for those developed by German
scientist Gernot Zippe in the 50s

Valerie turns to her notes from her reading

VALERIE
Youre right Im no nuclear
expert But Dr Houston Wood at
Virginia U atomic facility is He
also knows Dr Zippe whos 89 and
lives in Austria and he told him
that the wall thickness of the
Iraqi tubes was three or four times
the thickness of his design

PAUL
And the tubes are twice as long as
Zippes design In fact the only
similarity between his tubes and
the alumumium tubes is that theyre
made of aluminium

VALERIE
A metal that hasnt been used in
gas centrifuges since 1952

The chauvanist analysts share a look of respect for Valerie
Still Turner doesnt give up

TURNER
I went to Vienna Canada Ive
worked on this for months Theyre
centrifuges Fact

PAUL
So basically theyre your tubes
and if we dont let you win youre
going home

TURNER
Thats pathetic

VALERIE
Joe No one is saying youre wrong
here But if youre right its
huge So we ask the question
Right We have to ask the question

three million dollars weather-
proofing the tubes Plus the tubes
are roughly twice too long Now you
could argue that thats to disguise

PAUL

And so apart from all the
scepticism surrounding the
specification the analysis from
the IAEA which I believe is
numbered in the report

(Stops Changes tack)
Mr Libby Energy department nuclear
scientists are among the most
boring people on the planet They
can talk about gas centrifuges
until you want to jump out of a
window And maybe once every ten
years someone comes along and says
so tell me about gas
centrifuges Thats literally the
only time you should listen to
these guys If they say an
aluminium tube is not for a gas
centrifuge its like a fish talking
about water Weve been over this
data with you now five six times
And We dont really know how you
want us to play this

Libby listens He nods Waits

LIBBY
Let me level with you here Paul I
dont know what these tubes are
for From everything youre saying
there could be something to this
but very likely not right

PAUL
Exactly

LIBBY
May I ask a question When you say
we dont really know how to play
this what do you mean

PAUL
(Stops Turns white)
Im just saying I dont know how to
say it any other way than that-

LIBBY
Except you didnt say “I you said

“we So you and the others have

discussed how to play these
briefings Why does the CIA feel
the need to play these briefings

PAUL
No I mean that Ok I didnt mean
what I just said

LIBBY
Which part The last part Or other
things too

PAUL
Im a getting a little confused-

LIBBY
You want me to come back

PAUL
No GOD no

The temperature drops five degrees

LIBBY
You dont know why Im here do you
In 1991 the United States invaded
Iraq and afterwards weapons
inspectors discovered Saddam was
six months off enriching uranium to
sufficiently high specification to
make a nuclear bomb He had fissile
material And not a single person
at the CIA from the DCI down to
the janitor had the slightest clue
that such a program even existed
So now one decade on are you
telling me that youre 100 sure
these tubes are not intended to
create nuclear weapons

PAUL
ISirOK With intelligence
nothings 100 percent

LIBBY
So What Are you Ninety nine
percent sure Ninety eight

PAUL

You cant put an exact figure You
cant be that precise

LIBBY

But if you had to say could you
say youre ninety seven percent
sure Is there a three percent
chance youve got this wrong Or
four Or five Still pretty good
odds You like those odds Paul You
willing to put your name to that
Are you ready to make that call

PAUL
I dont make the call Sir-

LIBBY

(Fixing him)
Yes you do Paul Each time you
interpret a piece of data Each
time you choose a maybe over a
perhaps you make a call A
decision And right now youre
making lots of little decisions
adding up to a big decision and out
theres a real world where millions
of people depend upon you being
right But what if theres a one
percent chance youre wrong Can
you say for sure youll take that
chance and state as a fact that
this equipment is not intended for
a nuclear weapons programme

The analyst sits frozen

LIBBY
Do you know what one percent of the
population of this country is Its
three million two hundred and
forty thousand souls

Sir Were not machines We It
We look at the evidence we game it

executed a certain official who had
been a loyal supporter He said he
would rather kill a friend in error
than allow an enemy to live For

correct

broader that would indicate that
there was no basis to the

specifically on the yellow cake
the yellow cake for Niger weve
acknowledged that that information
did turn out to be a forgery

day you were born in a freezing
cold airbase outside Anchorage

chances to introduce yourself Be
someone new But you turned out OK
Responsible A little too serious
Always looking down the road
Worrying where life was going to
drag you next But it made you
tough Real tough Maybe tougher
than I or your mother or anyone
knows

REAL VALERIE FOOTAGE
of safeguarding classified
information Im grateful for this
opportunity to set the record
straight I served the United
States loyally and to the best of
my ability as a covert operations
officer for the Central
Intelligence Agency I worked on
behalf of the national security of
our country on behalf of the
people of the United States until
my name and true affiliation were
exposed in the national media on
July 14th 2003 after a leak by
administration officials Today I
can tell this committee even more

(MORE)

REAL VALERIE FOOTAGE (contd)
In the run-up to the war with Iraq
I worked in the Counter
Proliferation Division of the CIA
still as a covert officer whose
affiliation with the CIA was
classified I raced to discover
solid intelligence for senior
policy makers on Iraq s presumed
weapons of mass destruction
program While I helped to manage
and run secret worldwide operations
against this WMD target from CIA
headquarters in Washington I also
traveled to foreign countries on
secret missions to find vital
intelligence I loved my career
because I love my country
