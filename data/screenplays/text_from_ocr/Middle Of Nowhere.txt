INT HOME - EVENING

Two profiles side by side In comfortable silence A woman
far beyond pretty A man solid and strong Both have their
heads lowered - almost reverently

Her expression is concentrated Whatever she’s gazing at
bears the burden of her full attention He is more at ease

We pull back to reveal their hands moving in rhythm as they
prepare food in a stylish kitchen

RUBY MURRAY 28 dices onions Disobedient hair Eyes
shining with promise and possibility

DEREK MURRAY 29 seasons an array of vegetables Handsome
In jeans White T-shirt Whiter sneaks Casually he
glances over at her work

DEREK
Smaller babe

RUBY
Um Okay Emeril

He smiles at her teasing then turns to the stove spooning
his mixture into a sizzling pan We can almost smell the
aroma wafting through the air

DEREK
What do I always tell you Huh
Don’t be mad at the skills

She shakes her head dicing the onions into smaller pieces

DEREK (CONTD)
Degree on the wall Another on the
way And can’t boil water

RUBY
Why do we both have to be good at
this Like my dicing prowess
really adds to the meal

DEREK
Your what

RUBY
You don’t need me in here

DEREK
I always need you

He comes up behind her and nuzzles her neck for a quick kiss
DEREK
The couple that cooks together

RUBY
Wow If Rashad and them knew how
corny you were

They share a laugh This is their routine
He samples a morsel from the steaming pan Then gently
places a piece in her mouth His hand on the small of her
back as she chews She struggles to hold back her delight
DEREK
You don’t have to say anything I

already know

She swats him playfully The DOOR BELL rings and he goes to
answer still laughing with her

DEREK (0S)
Don’t be mad at the skills Ruby

She rolls her eyes with a grin and continues dicing Then
YELLING A DOOR SLAMS NOISE SOUNDS OF A COMMOTION

She moves curiously to the kitchen entry and sees MEN Men
coming through her front door WITH GUNS

She sees Derek on the floor face down with a gun pointed at
his back What is this Then they come toward her

THE MEN
Knife We got a knife Down
Drop down now Drop the knife

DEREK
Ruby Drop the knife Ruby

She is still holding the knife she was dicing with
trembling She quickly lets it fall to the ground

As soon as she drops it two men quickly grab her shoulders
and push her down to the floor roughly

THE MEN
Down now Face down

DEREK
Watch how you handlin’ her

She is face down and terrified A man has a gun on her and
his knee in her back as he HANDCUFFS her
Her skin burns against the carpet More men rush through
their townhome swarming every corner Now she sees their
jackets “ATF” is stitched on the back

She looks over at Derek stunned His eyes are on her too
filled with pain Desperate A confession without words

A plate CRASHES on the hardwood The agents toss the
closets Overturn shelves spilling her precious books The
men step on her medical texts poetry collections and novels
like cobblestones as they lift her to her feet They
navigate her downstairs in unison one agent on each arm

EXT DEREK AND RUBY’S TOWNHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

As the men take her to the front door of the complex she
TRIPS on the last step thrust head first into the moonlight
The agents hold her up and move her on quickly The physical
pain is a small thing compared to her humiliation And fear

Police cars surround their home Neighbors gather outside
shocked She drops her head to avoid their eyes

An agent places his hand on top of her head and pushes her
down into the back of an unmarked sedan As the car door
closes Derek is brought out in handcuffs surrounded by
officers His body language screams defeat

He searches for her in the confusion finding her eyes just
as he is put into a separate car They focus on each other
Never breaking their gaze Each from behind a car window
As he is driven away she leans her head on the glass and
whispers his name

EXT GREYHOUND BUS STATION - EARLY MORNING

BEGIN CREDIT SEQUENCE

We see the dark early morning sky before the sun rises We
see Ruby reading a pamphlet in low light

RUBY (VO)

story behind their eyes

the first day of each month One
hour equals one point Points will
not carry over from one month to
another After 15 minutes any

Ruby stands tentatively in the line of women Clearly a
first-timer The ladies give money to a MALE TICKET AGENT
who obliges without as much as an upward glance

INT GREYHOUND BUS - CONTINUOUS
Ruby boards the bus finds a seat and keeps to herself

RUBY (VO)

In addition the BOP has the
discretion to refuse facility entry

Ruby wears a simple top with a scoop neckline and an a-line
skirt of the appropriate length

She is the odd woman out No one speaks to her And she
doesn’t speak to them What is she doing here She doesn’t
belong She looks as if she’s going to flee at any moment

Then a SAMOAN WOMAN with an INFANT seems to acknowledge her
ever so slightly from across the aisle Recognition that
this isn’t normal That she is not alone

INT GREYHOUND BUS RIDE - CONTINUOUS

The bus weaves through the city streets and tall buildings
around Downtown LA before hitting the first of several
freeways There is no traffic in the dead of morning

The cities and counties zoom by Pasadena Glendora
Fontana The I-15 towards Barstow Crestline Wrightwood
Hesperia Further and further away

Some women chat Some read or have headphones Most sleep
But not Ruby She takes it all in Watching Learning

As the sky changes she takes in the view The San
Bernardino Mountain range leading into the Mojave Desert
And then - VICTORVILLE 2 miles

The women and children grow quiet as a series of OMINOUS
BUILDINGS come into view A persistent chain link fence now
runs alongside the bus like a steely escort The fence is
topped with coiled layers of CONCERTINA RAZOR WIRE

A simple sign reminds the riders of their destination As if
they could have forgotten

UNITED STATES PENITENTIARY VICTORVILLE

EXT VICTORVILLE FEDERAL PRISON - A SHORT TIME LATER

Ruby along with the other women and children from her bus
line up outside the facility near a BARBED WIRE FENCE There
are about 200 other visitors filing out of cars taxicabs
city buses and on foot

The morning air is cold PRISON PERSONNEL watch the visitors
from inside the office flaunting their coffee

Numbered cards are distributed down the line The crowd
gears up to wait Veterans sit on blankets and pillows
Ruby stands

END CREDIT SEQUENCE

INT VICTORVILLE FEDERAL PRISON - LATER THAT MORNING

The gate is opened Ruby and the visitors file in by number
forming another line outside the VISITOR PROCESSING CENTER

Here the PRIMPING begins Mirrors are flipped open Brushes
and hairspray make their debut Lipgloss abounds

Ruby notices almost everyone wiping their hands with cleanser
and towelettes She doesn’t have that and doesn’t know what
it’s for She’s lost

The Samoan woman from the bus PONGESA sees her confusion

PONGESA
It’s for the Ion Scan They look
for drug traces

RUBY
Oh

PONGESA
It’s the surest way you ain’t
gettin’ in That and boobs

RUBY
(touching her neckline)
Does this show too much

PONGESA
(chuckling)
Nah youre alright

Pongesa hands her a few sanitizer wipes

PONGESA
Wipe down real good Your shoes
belt buttons Especially the
hands It’s hella sensitive You
ain’t gotta have nothing on you
But it’ll pick up a trace from
something you touched back on the
bus Something on the money you
handed dude at the station A
doorknob Whatever

Ruby wipes her hands carefully as Pongesa counts her diapers
and throws an extra one in the trash

Other women toss lipsticks combs perfume and small mirrors
in the trash bin The blankets and pillows are ditched too
None of it is allowed past this point
INT USP VICTORVILLE PROCESSING CENTER - LATER
Ruby waits for her number to be called then shows her ID

We see HER FILE on the computer She’s been issued a number
in the system Her picture comes up on the screen The file
states that she is a spouse That Derek was convicted of
FIREARM TRAFFICKING And that she is approved to visit

An officer runs a handheld filter over her shoes hands legs
and shoulders We see the first signs of uncertainty as she
awaits the results She is soon cleared

She’s officially inside the prison

INT USP VICTORVILLE VISITING ROOM - A SHORT TIME LATER

A large room with barred windows Just tables benches and
vending machines GUARDS man the corners emotionless It
is LOUD There is no play area for the kids so they run
around restlessly

The room is segregated by race MEXICANS on one side
BLACKS on the other WHITES outnumbered are in the middle

The caged men begin to emerge Each one takes his corner
making sure not to look at another inmate the wrong way
Making sure not to show weakness of any kind

RUBY (VO)
Inmates will be permitted to
embrace their visitor within good
taste at the beginning and end of a
visit Inmates will not be
permitted to hold the hand of a
visitor or put their arms around
their visitor while seated
Inmates will sit across from
visitors not side by side

With each man brought out her apprehension grows

Then DEREK appears She has to remind herself to smile He
goes to her with guarded anticipation A beat as they drink
each other in Then they HUG Tentative at first Then
eyes close Arms wrap tight His face in her hair She
holds on Trying to make it last Twenty seconds at most
until they let go awkwardly and sit opposite each other

RUBY
You look good
DEREK
No you look good

RUBY
I miss you
DEREK
Me too
(beat)

You alright

RUBY
I’m fine How about you

DEREK
Are you okay Ruby

RUBY
I’m just fine baby How are you

Her concern grows at his long silence And then

DEREK
How’s school

His words are loaded She’s caught off-guard

RUBY
I was going to tell you

His worst fear confirmed

RUBY (CONTD)
I can’t focus on that right now
I’1ll start back on next semester

DEREK
(quietly)
What are you doing Ruby

RUBY
It’s not for me right now

DEREK
We talked about this

RUBY
No you talked about it

A tense beat
DEREK

Look you don’t have to do this
Don’t be a martyr
RUBY
A martyr

DEREK
You know what I mean

RUBY
I’m your wife Id fully expect
you to be here if the tables were
turned

DEREK
Well I don’t expect that I don’t
want this for you

RUBY
To be frank with you I don’t care
what you want right now

DEREK
Listen to me Let’s be realistic
You were on your way to doing
something Don’t stop

RUBY
We were on our way

This lands hard on him What could have been

RUBY (CONT’D)
It’s a break that’s all My
heart’s not in it right now Next
semester okay

DEREK
(almost to himself)
I can’t believe this

RUBY
It’s not that serious I said I’1l
go back soon

DEREK
You just dropping out after all
that work I mean who are you
talking to here I know what’s up
Why would you do that Look how
they got me in here I can’t do
this I can’t take care of you I
can’t even hold your hand You
don’t need to be here I don’t
want you to I don’t want you to
see me like this
He’s clearly in pain They both are

RUBY
It doesn’t matter where I see you
Listen to me As long as I see
you You look the same to me
wherever you are You hear me
This is what we’ve got now It’s
not good But it’s what we’ve got
And you will do it We will see
each other on every weekend
Youll call every day You’1ll know
about my day And I’11 know about
yours Like always You need to
make this work So when you come
home we start over That’s what
were going to do

DEREK
Eight years Ruby You don’t wanna
do this for eight years

RUBY
Five years with good time

DEREK
You’re not even listening to me
Try to understand what I’m saying

RUBY
Youre not listening to me What’s
supposed to happen in this scenario
of yours I can’t get up here on
weekends around labs I’11 miss
any call you make during the day
because of class I barely had
time when you were home So how’s
it supposed to work with you two
hours away both ways lLet’s not
talk about when residency starts

DEREK
I know It doesn’t work

Now she understands what he’s trying to do

RUBY
Whatever you’re thinking I’d do if
we broke up you’re wrong
(beat)
You made a commitment to me

DEREK
I’m not trying to break my
commitment to you Ruby I’m
trying to tell you I want you to
keep going with your life Don’t
stop for this Look at this
Don’t stop for me

RUBY
You are me Remember

This crushes him
RUBY (CONTD)
If you were telling the truth when
you said youd make this right
Make it right
A long serious beat She’s not going to fail at this
RUBY (CONTD)
Five years with good time
(beat)
Say it

He can’t

RUBY (CONTD)
Say it Derek

He doesn’t want to

RUBY
For me

He meets her eyes They look at each other deeply

RUBY
What about me

She’s breaking his heart Defeated he gives her what she
wants Against his own

DEREK
(with effort)
Five with good time

INT CITY BUS - MID-CITY - EARLY EVENING

We look through a CITY BUS WINDOW It’s dusk as we move
through a part of Los Angeles not captured on postcards

Latino men play soccer in the park An elderly black woman
enters a storefront church in heels and pearls A teenager
rides a bike with his girl on the handlebars

Ruby observes the hustle and bustle beyond the bus She’s
FOUR HARD YEARS OLDER than we just saw her Her original
beauty now hidden beneath hospital scrubs and convenient
hair

She exits with a familiar wave to the driver Then ignores

a passerby and his pick-up line This is her neighborhood
She knows who’s worth a word and who isnt

INT CHECK CASHING PLACE - A SHORT TIME LATER

Ruby reads ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY magazine in line

When its her turn she slides cash and a form through a slot
in the BULLETPROOF GLASS

RUBY
(in a low voice)
300 for commissary please

INT RUTHS HOUSE - NIGHT

A moth flutters against the porch light Ruby knocks on the
front door No answer She tries again louder Nothing
Then after some thought she enters with her key

On the other side of the door comes an attractive older
woman Still wet in her bathrobe and irritated about it
This is her mother RUTH 55

RUTH
If you’re going to use the key why
knock

RUBY
Sorry

Ruth goes back to the bathroom Ruby crosses to the TV

RUBY (CONT’D)

I brought cheap Chinese I was
going to watch the awards over
here Remember

(beat)
If I leave my place when it’s over
I won’t make it to work on time

(a long beat)
Ma

RUTH (0S)
Fine fine

A modest home adorned with PHOTOS of Ruby and her sister
ROSIE In a larger frame is a picture of a sweet little boy
NICKIE

Ruby sets out the Chinese food Ruth returns dry this time

RUBY
Where’s Nickie Rosie came early

A beat as Ruby watches her mother fidget Something’s wrong

RUTH
I don’t want to talk about that
girl right now

(beat)

She’s completely irrational Who
knows what I did to her this week
She’s putting him in an after-
school program Did she discuss
this with you Are you going to be
picking him up

RUBY
This is the first I’m hearing

Ruth doesn’t believe that for a minute They begin to eat
Ruby switches the TV to red carpet arrivals

RUBY (CONTD)
I’m going to be taking some extra
shifts So I’m not sure how much
I can help if that’s what she’s
thinking

RUTH
Day shifts

RUBY
I’m just trying to catch up on a
few things

RUTH
Good Finally Time to get on
with it

RUBY
Today’s a good day Ma Let’s
not

RUTH
Oh I forgot Today’s special Is
this how you’re supposed to spend
today darling This is it

Ruby’s focuses on the happy celebrities on TELEVISION

RUTH (CONT’D)
Is this how people celebrate
Watching strangers dressed up on
TV I’m talking here

RUBY
I don’t know Ma

RUTH
Oh am I bothering you Okay well
don’t let me bother you and your
friends here

Off Ruby as Ruth walks away

INT HOSPITAL LOBBY - NIGHT

The hospital is hallow A deep quiet floats where there was

a sea of noise only hours earlier The janitor’s vacuum hums

as Ruby stands in the deserted gift shop Elevator music

wafts in She reviews the greeting cards one after another

INT NURSES LOUNGE - LATER

Ruby writes on an anniversary card “Next year I’1l whisper

this in your ear Happy anniversary I love you” She

brings the envelope to her lips lingers then seals it

INT HOSPITAL LOBBY - LATER

At the mail slot she slips the card through and watches it

fall Then starts down the sterile white hallway

INT PATIENT ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Ruby hands a CANCER PATIENT a pill cup from a metal tray
RUBY

I can’t dispense Morphine without
an order He didn’t leave one

PATIENT
So what the hell am I supposed to
do here huh I need something

RUBY
The strongest I can administer is
T3 until I can get Dr Massey on
the phone It’s got Codeine

PATIENT
Fuck Codeine I’11 have to wait
three hours for it to wear off
before I can get the Morphine
This is bullshit You know it is
He can’t just leave me here like
this I need Morphine Please
help me

RUBY
There’s nothing I can do but keep
paging him If you want to try the
T3 it’ll take the edge off a
little bit while we wait

He closes his eyes in pain She’s helpless And then
She leans into him Close

RUBY
You are stronger than this thing
(after a beat he nods)
I’ve got smooth cool popsicles I
got grape I got cherry Orange
C’mon sweetie

She places his hand on his chest to comfort him

PATIENT
Cherry

RUBY
Cherry it is And Conan starts in

She does a little Conan O’Brien dance snipping an imaginary
cord on each hip and getting a sad smile from her patient

RUBY (CONTD)
I’‘1l keep paging the doctor

The patient nods then turns away in agony Ruby watches him
for a moment As she crosses the room upset she shoves the
PILL CUP INTO HER POCKET

EXT BUS STOP - MORNING

Ruby stands in the early morning sunshine tired People
walk past her to start their workdays just as hers is ending
Others waiting with her at the bus stop appear irritated

She looks at her watch then up the street

She pulls a bus schedule from her purse and examines the
jigsaw puzzle of times and tables Frustrated she begins to
WALK QUICKLY from this stop and around the corner to another

INT CITY BUS - MINUTES LATER

The doors SWING OPEN to reveal BRIAN commanding the drivers
seat The hardworking type with a sly smile Thirties

Ruby runs up out of breath and waits behind a YOUNG MAN

YOUNG HUSTLER
Just ‘til tomorrow C’mon man

Ruby closes her eyes She’s had a long night and a longer
morning Listening to this is the last thing she needs

BRIAN
(amused )
My man You ain’t paid for last
week What am I Your daddy
Need to get a job brother Step
on outside man

The young hustler climbs off the bus defeated Ruby steps
up with bus schedule in hand

BRIAN
(to Ruby)
You believe that

RUBY
You go to Alameda and Wilmington

BRIAN
Um Alameda and Rosecrans

RUBY
And then can I get the 19 to Pine

BRIAN
You don’t wanna do that You need
to pick up the 72 in front of the
hospital

RUBY
The 72 in front of the hospital is
late as usual and I’ve been up all
night So can you just tell me if
the 19 gets me there

BRIAN
Oh Yeah it does It’1ll take you
a little out the way but at
least you’ll be moving

She tucks the schedule in her purse and feeds the farebox
impatiently

RUBY
(under her breath)
You all need to get better
organized

BRIAN
I’1l make sure to pass that along
at the next company retreat

Wait Is he trying to be funny Any other day she might
have chuckled with him but not today

INT BRIAN’S BUS - MINUTES LATER

Waves of people pour onto the bus all jockeying for
position Ruby sits in her scrubs watching the cars below

She catches a glimpse of a REGAL OLD WOMAN well-dressed
slowly making her way down the narrow aisle She’s about
seventy-five gentle in appearance but determined in spirit

The woman finds no empty seats so she holds onto a balance
bar At this Ruby immediately stands and waves her over

RUBY
Have a seat ma’am

OLD WOMAN
Thank you honey

NEW ANGLE on the bus’ REARVIEW MIRROR We see Brian as he
observes the kindness that just took place

When the old woman is seated and settled she smiles up at
Ruby who is standing above her

OLD WOMAN
I’m Cornelia

RUBY
Hello

Ruby just wanted to give her a seat - not have a
conversation She delves into her US WEEKLY But as Ruby
stands over Cornelia she can’t help but watch

The old woman begins to KNIT UP A STORM with bright red yarn

Her fingers twirl as she gazes out the GRIMY BUS WINDOW with
a private smile It’s as if she sees something good out
there - not the pawn shops and liquor stores dotting the way

Ruby follows her eyes Doesn’t see anything worth watching
and goes back to the world within her magazine

INT CITY BUS - LATER

Ruby sits next to Cornelia now watching her knit out of the
corner of her eye Cornelia senses her observer

CORNELIA
You know how

RUBY
Um no No I don’t

CORNELIA
It’s good to know

RUBY
It looks hard actually

CORNELIA
Nope See this loop Then twist
and pull through Watch it again
See Try it

RUBY
Oh No thank you It’s okay

CORNELIA
Too hard huh

Cornelia pokes out her bottom lip making a PATHETIC FACE
Ruby can’t help but laugh then surprises herself by taking
the yarn The old woman watches her student attempt a loop
and smiles with satisfaction

CORNELIA
See You’ll be making things soon

RUBY
I don’t know about that

CORNELIA
Keep at it It’s meditation more
than anything Just something to
be creative Get wild and crazy
Express yourself

RUBY
Wild and crazy with knitting

Cornelia pulls purple yarn from her bag for Ruby

RUBY (CONT’D)
Were gonna mess it up

CORNELIA
Girl you’d better weave that in

RUBY
I don’t know where to start

CORNELIA
Just start
(of Ruby’s hesitation)
What’s the problem Sweetpea It’s
not brain surgery

Ruby laughs at the little woman This is ridiculous She
makes her loops into a hideous design

CORNELIA
Oh my Look at that

RUBY
This is bad

CORNELIA
Bad but yours You keep that

RUBY
Oh no ma’am Thank you

CORNELIA
Shoot I don’t want it

Cornelia is as sharp as a whip with a contagious energy

CORNELIA (CONTD)
And it’s Cornelia

RUBY
Cornelia I’m Ruby

EXT RUBYS APARTMENT - MORNING
Ruby reviews the contents of her mailbox with disappointment
She drags up the stairs to her place with a shopping bag

A woman and her pre-teen daughter are rushing out of their
apartment down the stairs at the same time

RUBY RUSHING MOM
Morning you guys Late again
PRE-TEEN RUBY
Night Ruby Have a good one

Ruby reaches her floor exhausted But suddenly she
brightens

A VASE OF RED ROSES sits next to her door She kneels down
and seizes the card “I love you every day Derek”
Happiness

INT RUBY’S PLACE - MOMENTS LATER
Ruby kicks off her shoes and pulls off her scrubs

She admiringly places the vase on the center of a round
kitchen table

The apartment is small and colorless It’s clearly a place
to just eat and sleep and get ready for work to do it all
over again

Ruby takes a CARDBOARD BOX from underneath her desk and
reaches into her shopping bag for a cellophane-wrapped novel
Carefully she places it next to several crossword puzzle
books and magazines addressed to Derek Two thick photo
envelopes are tucked inside as well

INT RUBY’S PLACE - LATER THAT MORNING

In her tiny kitchen she places a Chicken Pot Pie in the
microwave She matter-of-factly eats at the table near her
flowers while watching kids walk to school

INT RUBYS BEDROOM - LATER

Sunlight shines through the blinds She shuts them and sets
the alarm to 230 pm E is on TELEVISION in the bg

Ruby sits on her bed spilling the contents of the CRUMPLED
PILL CUP into her hand She swallows the pills with ease
then lays back on her bed awaiting the effect

Soon we see what she feels What she wants As if it were
real The sheets begin to move DEREK is beside her He
reaches for her She sinks into him They fall asleep -
together

EXT PRE-SCHOOL LOBBY - LATER THAT DAY

Ruby kneels next to her nephew NICKIE 5 as he takes his
jacket from a miniature hook The boy is introverted
compared to the spastic energy of the other kids Very
matter-of-fact in his movements

MISS DOLLY the pre-school director waves goodbye to him

MISS DOLLY
Nick have a good weekend okay

NICKIE
Okay Miss Dolly
(to Ruby)
That’s my new name Nick

RUBY
Oh yeah You tell your Mommie

NICKIE
It’s my new school name

RUBY
So I can still call you Nickie

NICKIE
Yes if you want to

He struggles to put his jacket on

RUBY
Do it Grammie’s way

Ruby lays the jacket on the floor in front of him upside
down He leans over and slips his arms through the sleeves
then FLIPS it over his head with a grin They high-five

INT ROSIE’S PLACE - EVENING

Ruby and Nickie are entrenched in coloring books when ROSIE
unlocks the front door She enters in full GEISHA MAKEUP and
a short skirt All voluptuous confidence Nickie giggles

ROSIE
Gets him every time

She goes over to her son and kisses him on the cheek Then
begins peeling off the skimpy uniform

ROSIE (CONTD)
How you doing Pop

RUBY
Well it is a little ridiculous

ROSIE
The place is called Concubine
What did we expect

RUBY

I’m surprised it’s not being
picketed yet It’s like being
called Mamie’s and your uniform is
an Aunt Jemima get-up

ROSIE
Shoot for the tips I’m bringing
in Id even throw in a “Yessa
Massa”

Ruby shakes her head unamused

ROSIE (CONTD)
What I made 244 today - ona
lunch shift That’s a weekends
worth of tips at Fridays These
Hollywood folks don’t play
Tipping is an art for these people
And my baby needs to go to
Disneyland and Laker games this
summer Ain’t that right Pop

Nickie just starts to laugh at her again Then an idea

NICKIE
Aunt Rube Mom’s a good picture
for Uncle Derek right now

RUBY
You’re right You take it

Rosie rocks an “America’s Next Top Model” pose for the
disposable camera then keeps talking without missing a beat

ROSIE
More importantly I might find a
nice d-a-d-d-y type up in there

Ruby rolls her eyes as Rosie heads to the bathroom

ROSIE (0S)
In a minute I can get a real
babysitter who respects me Teach
him something instead of filling
his head with crap about me

Ruby looks over at Nickie who pretends he didn’t hear that
Rosie comes back out with a clean face She’s a slightly
younger much hipper version of Ruby

ROSIE
Let’s eat

INT PAULIE’S - LATER THAT NIGHT

A hole-in-the-wall Ruby Rosie and Nickie sit eating at
barstools The sisters watch the boy grapple with an
oversized taco getting a kick at the mess he’s making He
motions for Rosie to take a bite and in doing so accidently
flings sauce in his mother’s hair and on Ruby’s top A
stunned moment before they all break out laughing

ROSIE
Little boy no you didn’t I just
got my hair done Nicholas

Nickie is convulsing with giggles while Ruby taps at her
shirt with a napkin and a smile

ROSIE (CONT’D)
Put some water on it It’1ll stain

RUBY
I don’t care It’s fine

Rosie heads to the restroom to get cute again A beat later
Ruby feels a tap on her shoulder She turns to find GINA a
beauty in tight pants with a shy little girl of 10 DEEDEE

GINA
Hello Ruby

Ruby immediately self-conscious about her appearance dabs
her napkin in water and wipes at the sauce on her shirt

RUBY
Hi Gina Hi there DeeDee

GINA
This has to be Rosie’s boy

Nickie swivels around but Ruby protectively turns him back

RUBY
How’ve you been

GINA
Excellent And yourself

RUBY
I’m well

GINA
So how is he

RUBY
He’s fine

GINA
Right Well tell Mr Fine we need
money I haven’t seen a dime in
two months

RUBY
We sent school clothes last month

GINA
She don’t need clothes She needs
money How do you all think we’re
living I depend on that money

RUBY
I know I’m trying We’re trying

GINA
He’s not seeing her until he pays

Nickie tries to turn again but Ruby holds him still

RUBY
You never let him see her when he
did pay She’s been on the
visitation list for four years

GINA
Just because I don’t want to drag
her all the way up to that place
don’t mean he’s not gonna pay We
need cash not prizes okay

RUBY
He’s doing the best he can You
could at least let him talk to her
on the phone That’s not right

GINA
Youre not as smart as people say
Why do you care if I take her to
see him If I were you I wouldn’t
want me coming around too much

ROSIE
Gina Ruby ain’t worried about you

Gina turns to find ROSIE standing very close and very
confident Gina is taken aback but recovers

GINA
Sure she’s not

They watch Gina as she leaves hand-in-hand with DeeDee
Nickie finally gets a look in wide-eyed

EXT RUBY’S PLACE - LATER THAT NIGHT
Rosie pulls onto Ruby’s street Nickie is in the backseat

ROSIE
I don’t need you to babysit We’1l
take him with us This is how we
build a social life And I need
one dude Dockweiler’1l be packed
for the long weekend C’mon

RUBY
I can’t Rose I’m exhausted

ROSIE (CONT’D)
(to Nickie)
We want to go out huh Pop

NICKIE

NICKIE

Uncle Derek on the big ship

ROSIE
Can’t you miss one time Nickie

NICKIE
Let’s live Aunt Rube You can
bring Uncle Derek Go get him and
bring him with us

Ruby and Rosie ignore that as the car pulls up to Ruby’s
place She squeezes Nickie before climbing out

Rosie and Nickie watch her for safety as she walks to her
building and grabs the mail from the box Once she’s inside
the gate they drive away

Ruby leafs through her mail as she makes her way up the
stairs Then SHE STOPS COLD Close on AN OFFICIAL-LOOKING
LETTER from USP Parole Board

She rips it open We watch her read We watch her face
change We watch JOY WASH OVER HER

She turns and RUNS Out the gate Onto her street Rosie’s
car is half-way up the block Ruby is laughing and waving

RUBY
(at the top of her lungs)
Rose Rosie

Dogs bark She’s in the middle of the street now Jumping
to get her sister’s attention Laughing and jumping

Rosie’s brake lights go on She makes a U-Turn then speeds
back to Ruby standing in the street

ROSIE
(alarmed)
What’s wrong

Nickie is all worry from the back seat Ruby can’t speak
She hands Rosie the letter

ROSIE
(reading)
USP Inmate Derek J Murray is
eligible for early Oh Good
Jesus

Ruby’s wide smile trumps all Rosie hops out of the car and
grabs her sister They sway and hug as Nickie watches on
happily

INT RUBY’S PLACE - NIGHT

Wrapped in a bath towel she moves around her apartment with
an excited energy Like she’s getting ready for a date

Clothes are spread out over the bed as she examines one
outfit after another She paints her fingernails

She breaks a roll of quarters into the clear pouch Grabs
the care package from under her desk and sifts through the
photo envelopes counting out 10 images to take with her

She opens a package of cheap white pillows and pulls one out
She matter-of-factly places it in a shopping bag with a
package of sanitizer wipes and 99-cent lipstick

INT GREYHOUND BUS RIDE - MORNING

Ruby is in a fantastic mood as she sits with PONGESA and her
now four-year old daughter

PONGESA
He dedicated a song to me on Art
Laboe last Sunday

RUBY

I’m jealous Which one
PONGESA

Jodeci “Forever My Lady”
RUBY

Perfect
PONGESA

I know It made me cry I’m gonna
do “Adore” back to him this
weekend We played that every week
when I was suspended

RUBY
Suspended For what

PONGESA
Kissing

RUBY

What No you didn’t

PONGESA
I never told you that Girl yeah
We were going at it They didn’t
even see us for a few minutes

The women crack up together Pongesa’s daughter giggles too

PONGESA (CONT’D)
Then they came over and told me to
get up and terminated the visit
I couldn’t see him for ninety days

RUBY
Uh-uh I don’t believe you did
that

PONGESA

I know huh TI wouldn’t do it now
but back then I didn’t even care
I was like whatever

Smiling the women enjoy the memory just before it fades

The Greyhound continues down the dusty highway Ruby turns
to gaze out the window with a private smile

INT VISITOR’S ROOM —- DAY

Ruby waits among the other visitors If they only knew her
good news

DEREK emerges from behind a steel door He is more muscular
than we’ve seen him before His head now shaved bald

She practically jumps up from her seat They hug tight then
sit opposite each other She’s beyond excited

RUBY
Can you even believe it I can’t
believe it Ten months early
Baby you’re coming home

He nods half-heartedly

DEREK
It’s good news

RUBY
It’s great news

DEREK
I just don’t want to get our hopes
up too high You know they don’t
do us fair

She’s puzzled by the response This is what they’ve been
waiting for

RUBY
You’re just nervous I am too
But remember there’s a better
chance you’re coming home than not
They’re overcrowded in here They
want to let out non-violent
offenders With stable homes You
got everything going for you
You’re coming home

He looks at her so giddy so beautiful He tries to match
her enthusiasm nodding his head with a smile

DEREK
It’s great news baby

RUBY
Heck yes it is So look I seta
meeting with Fraine on the 28th to
go over stuff for the hearing I
want her to talk to Littleton and
try to get a positive report or
recommendation Legal Aid says
unit managers sometimes give them

DEREK
When’d you talk to Fraine’s office

RUBY
This morning I called the
emergency number and got an
assistant It’s all set

DEREK
That’s a lot of money Ruby

RUBY
She’s almost paid up from the
trial Just two more payments and
were even lLet’s just use her
It won’t hurt right

Derek’s not pleased with the idea An awkward silence
What’s wrong with him She tries to lighten the mood

RUBY (CONTD)
I saw DeeDee at Paulie’s

DEREK
How she look

RUBY
Pretty Sweet She’s a sweet
little girl

DEREK
Yeah Gina give you any problems

RUBY
Nope

RUBY (CONTD)
Gina’s Gina Beautiful and stank

DEREK
How about just stank

RUBY
Okay
DEREK
(amused )
Okay

They’re connected again Back to themselves for a moment

RUBY
What’s that

DEREK
What

RUBY
That

She reaches across the table and pulls down the collar of his
shirt to reveal part of an INTIMIDATING TATTOO She runs her
hand over it It’s fairly recent And then

GUARD ON INTERCOM
Table 16 Back it up

At this Derek begins to fume He turns to the guard
defiantly staring him down Ruby clenches his wrist

GUARD ON INTERCOM
Problem 16

RUBY
Derek Don’t What are you doing

He turns back upset She’s completely surprised by his
reaction and she can’t help but stare at the tattoo

DEREK
It’s just a tat Ruby

RUBY
That’s obvious Of what

DEREK
Just some street shit

RUBY
Street shit What does that mean

DEREK
It don’t mean nothing Just
something to do

RUBY
It obviously means something

DEREK
Ruby a tattoo is the least of my
worries Just leave it

RUBY
(beat)
What’s going on in here Derek

DEREK
What do you think’s going on

Eye to eye for a moment longer than comfortable They’1ll
never get used to the visiting room relationship Intimacy
within the confines of one overcrowded room No privacy No
air Just tension And a ticking clock

RUBY
I’m thinking you’re working and
studying and keeping your head down
so you can come home That’s what
I think

Her fear is palpable He eases up smooths it over

DEREK
It’s just for show It ain’t
nothing Don’t worry about me

She’s unconvinced An awkward beat

DEREK
Remember what we were doing six
years ago this weekend What is it
about 200 right now So we’re on
the water Crystal blue Sun’s
setting You had on that little
white thing With the yellow uh-
huh looking gorgeous

(MORE)
DEREK (contd)
We both trying not to get seasick
‘cause we ain’t never sailed
before

The memory softens her

RUBY
Eating saltine crackers

DEREK
Trying to be sexy at the beach
eating saltine crackers

They laugh a little Then

DEREK
Happy anniversary baby

RUBY
Happy anniversary

A moment of understanding passes between them

DEREK (CONT’D)
When’s the last time you went to
the beach

RUBY
I don’t even know Rosie was just
talking about taking Nickie to
Dockweiler To see the fireworks

DEREK
You going right You gotta go

Tender

She nods Then reaches into her pouch and pulls out several
PICTURES Nickie and Rosie Billboards And one of DeeDee

RUBY
It’s just the back of her It’s
all I could get

Ruby’s looking at the picture Derek’s looking at her

EXT DOCKWEILER BEACH - NIGHT

Fireworks erupt lighting the dark sky Ruby Rosie and

Nickie are beachside gazing to the heavens
The sisters stroll up the shore

blankets

from cars and portable radios

They turn to find Brian trudging through the sand
away from a group near a fire

ROSIE
Okay don’t tell Ma I don’t want
to hear her mouth about it This
is a serious theory okay

RUBY
Okay

ROSIE

yelling across the beach realizing
I didn’t even know your name
Didn’t mean to be rude

RUBY

They shake hands and he holds on a little longer than
kosher Ruby notices Rosie only sees a fresh prospect
She reaches for his hand and he obliges with a quick grip

ROSIE

RUBY

RUBY
We came to see the show

ROSIE
I had to convince her to come But
it’s such a beautiful night You
can’t waste a night like this

Ruby knows that voice It’s Rosie’s sexy voice She looks
over and does a double take when she finds Rosie’s hooded
sweat jacket unzipped revealing a low-cut tank top

BRIAN
Yeah it was a good show this year
Hey why don’t ya’ll come on over
There’s Phillips BBQ Cold beer

Rosie’s ready to accept the invite but Ruby answers first

RUBY
We were just heading out

BRIAN
(teasing)
Where you going Can I come

Rosie gets the message loud and clear Then smiles slyly
watching her sister handle some long-overdue attention

RUBY
I’m sure you’d rather be here

Two pretty women near the fire HOWL with laughter beer in
hand His group is having big fun

BRIAN

Rosie’s disappointed at the lie

BRIAN

Ruby holds up her hand displaying her wedding ring

ROSIE (CONT’D)

Rosie grabs Nickie’s hand and walks ahead Ruby turns to
watch Brian’s party for a moment The men and women laugh
together and dance to the music Free and unburdened

Ruby smiles at them Her time is soon coming
As she begins to walk away from the beach we see what she
feels What she wants DEREK is walking beside her His
arm casually around her They stroll along - together

INT VICTORVILLE ADMINISTRATOR’S OFFICE - LATER

Ruby sits at a metal desk across from Derek’s unit manager

MR LITTLETON He reviews a file

MR LITTLETON
No wonder we couldn’t locate him in
Gen Pop Seems there was a fight
on his block a few days back

RUBY
Is he okay

MR LITTLETON
(reading)
Medic took a look Held him for 48
hours Released him back to the
block last night

RUBY
So he’s okay right

MR LITTLETON
Assume so They released him The
disciplinary record doesn’t have a
lot of detail on that You’d have
to file for a medical record
There’s some pretty serious
offenses attached to this incident
Two inmates critical

(MORE)

MR LITTLETON (contd)
Looks like a guard was involved
Doesn’t say what the extent of that
injury was

RUBY
Can he use the phones now or can I
get a medical visit or something

MR LITTLETON
You don’t understand He’s got
charges from this incident Says
he was released from the medic into
Gen Pop lockdown awaiting solitary
transfer One week in Ad Seg

RUBY
Wait What What are the charges

MR LITTLETON
Assault instigating a melee

RUBY
A melee That can’t be right

MR LITTLETON
It’s right alright He’s a
convicted felon Not a stretch

books

MR LITTLETON

stretch of road ahead

INT ROSIE’S PLACE - DAY

Nickie’s enjoying cartoons Ruby clearly exhausted does
the same day over again As she stacks her sister’s BRIDAL
MAGAZINES in a neat pile there’s a KNOCK on the door The
peephole reveals RUTH
RUTH
Hi Where’s Rosie

RUBY
At work

RUTH
Youre watching the baby

Ruth doesn’t wait for an answer walking past Ruby

NICKIE
Hi Grammie

RUTH
Hi Sweetie
(to Ruby)
I raised two kids but she thinks
you can take better care of him

RUBY
I’m just right up the street

RUTH
I can be here in 10 minutes Or
he could be over with me in a clean
place for a change And when are
you supposed to sleep You’re
working some nights some days --

RUBY
I actually decided not to do the
days

RUTH
Why

Ruby looks over to make sure Nickie isn’t listening

RUBY
I don’t feel good about missing his
calls right now He’s going
through a tough time I think

RUTH
Oh he’s going through a tough time
I see Then by all means sit
home and wait to comfort him That
makes a lot of sense

Ruth lowers her voice They both watch Nickie singing
to cartoons on TELEVISION

RUTH (CONTD)
Why is she trying to keep me from
my grandson

RUBY
She’s not trying to keep you from
him Ma Maybe she just has a
certain way she wants to do things

RUTH
You two always have a certain way
you want to do things It never
seems to involve me

Ruby doesn’t know what to say

RUBY
I’m sorry Ma

Disappointed with the answer Ruth goes to Nickie

NICKIE
Where you going Grammie

RUTH
Home baby Be good for me

NICKIE
Okay love you

She shuts the door behind her

INT BRIAN’S BUS - MORNING

Ruby climbs onto the bus and goes to drop her coins in the

farebox

It’s clear he wants to talk - maybe even flirt

Brian COVERS THE SLOT with his hand

BRIAN

sure how she feels about that but stands near him on the
crowded bus anyway

RUBY
Okay And yours

BRIAN
You look different in real clothes

RUBY

Ruby shakes her head no

BRIAN (CONTD)

if you want to check it out

RUBY
(a beat)
You see my ring right

BRIAN
Yeah but I You don’t seem
My bad My bad I didn’t mean to
offend you A ring doesn’t always
mean I thought you might’ve been
separated or something I know a
sister who rocks one so she can
walk up the street without getting
hollered at I figured it was
something like that That’s on me

He pulls over As riders begin to pour in she ventures
deeper into the bus to find a safe place He watches her

INT BRIAN’S BUS - LATER THAT MORNING

Cornelia and Ruby sit side by side both knitting on the same
piece as is now their routine Comfortable together Like
old friends

CORNELIA
(under her breath)
Cornelia you going to hell

RUBY
I’m sorry

CORNELIA
I’ve lived a pretty good life but
sure as I sit here I know I’m going
to hell

RUBY
What

CORNELIA
Not right for a woman my age Look
at me straight from church and
just sinnin’ already But can I
tell you about that dark drink of
water

Cornelia motions toward the front of the bus in Brian’s
direction as he assists a rider in a wheelchair onto the bus
Ruby watches him then shakes her head

RUBY
You’re something else

CORNELIA
I know I am That’s what I know
But that young man reminds me of
somebody nice So when I see him
I’m not thinking the right things
Hellbound I’m telling you

Cornelia cracks up Ruby joins in

RUBY
What you thinking about

CORNELIA
Oh no

RUBY
Tell me You’ve gone ahead and
opened the can Might as well

CORNELIA
Billy Fisher

RUBY
Billy Fisher

CORNELIA
Hmmm The most beautiful black man
I ever did see

Ruby settles in for a good story with a grin

RUBY
Fine

CORNELIA
Honey yes Hard-working like that
one there With a crooked smile
just the same Comfortable in his
own skin strong with his hands
and I’m telling you I couldn’t
get air when I was around that man
Plain couldn’t breathe the first
few times around him

RUBY
So what happened

CORNELIA
He asked after me and that was
that We were together for a good
long time

RUBY

So it was happily ever after
CORNELIA

That it was

(beat)

You got a man Sweetpea
(Ruby nods)

What’s he like

RUBY
He’s not around much

CORNELIA
Sometimes that’s better Don’t you
sit up nights waiting for him to
come home

(MORE)

CORNELIA (contd)
When he comes on home you just say
something sweet and go on about
your business Enjoy your evening
or day or what have you Have your
own things to do See your
girlfriends That’s the mistake we
make We don’t do what we should
When he’s there he’s there When
he’s not just go and live your
day you hear I’d do my shopping
Watch my stories Make my visits
or what have you It’s better that
way

RUBY
Yes ma’am

CORNELIA
You don’t believe me I can tell
Think I’m just an old lady who
don’t know what I’m talking about
But believe me it’ll save you a
lot of worrying

RUBY
I believe you

Cornelia points outside and gathers her things

CORNELIA (CONTD)
Slow on the draw today Sweetpea

Ruby pulls the CALL BELL for Cornelia

RUBY
Have a good day Ms Cornelia

CORNELIA
I intend to

The old woman makes her way down the aisle towards the front
Brian slides out of his seat and respectfully places her arm
around his She gazes up at him

BRIAN
Ms Cornelia watch your step here

CORNELIA
Brian honey Ill see you tomorrow

BRIAN
I’1l be here waiting for you Have
a good day now

Brian and Ruby’s eyes meet for a quick smile as he climbs
back into his seat She turns to watch Cornelia stride up the
street The picture of class Dignified and independent

Ruby unconsciously straightens in her seat adjusts her
jacket and pats her hair into place

EXT RUBY’S PLACE - DAY TO NIGHT

Ruby enters her apartment We see the day go by Life moves
as folks head to work Kids walk to school

And over all this activity we hear DEREK’s VOICE

DEREK (VO)
Hi Baby I know you’re worried
but don’t be because I’m fine I’m
more worried about you and what
you think is going on in here I’m
sorry to put you through this You
probably came up here I don’t know
how much you know There was a
fight and some things went down
If people runnin’ you run Ruby
If they fight you fight They
thought I was in the middle of it
but I wasn’t

Ruby closes the blinds as usual and sets her alarm She sits
on the bed The mailman comes Brothers fix a car across
the street A woman walks her dog

DEREK (VO)
Baby I’m trying to come home You
gonna have the things we had again
Everything you deserve But no
shortcuts this time I promise
you I’m gonna be better I’m
trying But to be honest there’s
nothing in here for the better
I’m trying though The worst part
is thinking about what you’re
thinking I hate to put you
through tears It kills me

She reaches for a pill cup in the pocket of her scrubs Kids
are home from school They play in the street

DEREK (VO)
Rashad’s bringing you some money
that’s owed me I know I said
she’s a waste of money but I think
I do need Fraine for the hearing
(MORE)

DEREK (VO) (contd)
I need somebody who knows what
they’re doing

She takes the pill and lays back staring at the ceiling

DEREK (VO)
This lockdown is pretty bad and I
don’t know when it’s gonna be over
I hope this hook-up works and you
get this letter I don’t even know
if youll get this But I pray you
do When I’m home you won’t have
to worry about nothing It’ll be
like it used to be I’11 take care
of you I’1l1 take care of
everything Love Derek

Streetlights flicker on The starless sky looms open and
inviting Ruby begins to walk down the street to her bus

INT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE - DAY

Ruby sits in a well-appointed outer office of SHAW FRAINE
BOBB and ASSOCIATES leafing through magazines An ASSISTANT
appears

ASSISTANT
Mrs Murray

Ruby stands but the woman motions for her to remain seated

ASSISTANT (CONT’D)
Hi there I’m supposed to get a
money order from you

RUBY
(handing it over)
Yes

ASSISTANT
Thank you

The woman hands the money order to the receptionist Then
returns to Ruby

ASSISTANT (CONTD)
Mrs Murray Ms Fraine asked me to
notify you that we won’t be able to
open the parole case unless you can
remit the retainer in full

RUBY
I’ve been making regular payments

ASSISTANT
Yes the fees for the original
defense are now reconciled But
from our end I guess it’s risky to
continue with the next proceeding
without the full payment Because
youd been paying well slowly

Ruby is stunned Her surprise quickly grows into anger

ASSISTANT
I don’t know much about this I’m
sorry

RUBY
Id like to speak with her
directly

ASSISTANT
I’m sorry I don’t have anything on
her calendar open this week

Ruby grabs her purse and rises to leave Defeats starts to
seep in But almost to the exit she suddenly turns back

Heading with determination through those back office doors

INT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Ruby walks swiftly down the interior hallway glancing at
signs on each office door as she passes The assistant
trails behind desperate to stop her

Finally Ruby sees a door inscribed with ALBERTA FRAINE
With a quick twist of the knob Ruby opens the door

The lawyer is consulting with a well-dressed Latino couple
Ruby’s inside before she can say a word

RUBY
Youre dropping me

FRAINE
Ruby Can you give me a min

RUBY
You can cheat me with your fees
Youve been doing that since day
one Giving me an hour of prep and
charging me for five But what you
won’t do is jeopardize our case
FRAINE
(embarrassed)
Ruby I’m going to need you to

RUBY
If you’re asking me to pay in full
up front with two weeks notice
youre dropping me You know I
can’t do it You know that

FRAINE
Mrs Murray

RUBY
He’s in there with murderers and
rapists A thousand murderers and
rapists and thugs on his block
alone And you’re putting me in a
situation where I can’t help him

FRAINE
We have certain costs to
consider

RUBY
Youve been paid I paid every
month as stipulated in the payment
arrangement made with your
accounting department On a case
you lost by the way but doesn’t
matter What were you going to do
String me along until the hearing
date This is our life I don’t
know if this is an ethics violation
or what but I’1l be contacting the
bar And every professional
organization you belong to Is
this how your treat all your
clients Ms Fraine Or just the
black and brown ones

The Latino couple frowns waiting for the answer too

FRAINE
You know that’s not true We can
deal with this

RUBY
How are we going to deal with this

FRAINE
(crossing to her)
The existing retainer is obviously
outside of your comfort zone
(MORE)

FRAINE (contd)
Perhaps we put an associate on the
case who is more in your range

RUBY
I want you

FRAINE
I don’t ordinarily handle parole
reviews My associates are very
competent

They are eye to eye now

RUBY
You said he’s a small fish ina
big money business Nobody
regulates the gun makers or cares
about the unlicensed white boys at
the gunshows who buy and sell with
no problem whatsoever The low man
on the totem pole is the easiest to
reach You said all that to me
If you show up at the review it
carries some weight He asked for
you specifically Look I know you
need your money and you don’t want
to wait forever for it I get it
I just can’t pay it all up front

FRAINE
Ruby that payment arrangement was
reconfigured twice for you Only
because of this passion Don’t
get in over your head again

RUBY
The offense was non-violent First-
time No priors He’s doing good
time Stable home life There’s a
chance

FRAINE
Could you do 50 Can you do half

RUBY
I can get it

FRAINE
Okay See This is called a
negotiation It’s not uncommon
(to the couple)
See No problems here

off Ruby triumphant but troubled

INT RUTH’S APARTMENT - DAY

Ruby sits across from Ruth at the dining room table as if
she’s on the witness stand

RUTH
How much Ruby

RUBY
It’s 2500 I have 500 but they
need half up front

RUTH
I have to do math now too

RUBY
It’s seven fifty

RUTH
Seven hundred and fifty dollars

Ruth shakes her head and reaches into her purse for the
checkbook

Each moment feels longer than the last as Ruby watches her
mother write “Seven Hundred and Fifty Dollars” She LOWERS
HER HEAD and counts the seconds until this is over

RUTH
My car payment is due on the 15th

RUBY
I’1l have it back to you by then

Ruth looks upon her daughter It’s a pained look brimming
with tenderness But it is brief She tears the check from
its book and slides it across the table

RUTH
Hold your head up please

Then she rises to leave Off Ruby

INT BRIAN’S BUS - DAY

Ruby rides as usual The bus BUMPS along Everyone rises
and falls together in a weird sort of harmony

Cornelia makes her way onto the bus We notice that she
passes by Brian without a word

Brian nods at her from his perch but the old woman doesn’t
respond Her eyes are VACANT as she flashes her bus pass

Ruby waves her over Cornelia looks at her usual companion
as if she’s a perfect stranger Ruby waves again Cornelia
doesn’t recognize her Then the woman slips into a seat
several places away

THROUGH THE REARVIEW MIRROR Brian watches regretfully
knowingly

The old woman’s eyes are empty disconnected Ruby struggles
to understand Never taking her eyes off of Cornelia

INT BRIAN’S BUS - LATER THAT MORNING

Ruby watches Cornelia closely The old woman’s stop is
coming up but she doesn’t make a move

Ruby tugs at the CALL BELL for her from afar Cornelia is
motionless Ruby looks up to the front of the bus towards
Brian unsure of what to do He is watching through his
rearview

As he pulls the bus to the curb he calls out

BRIAN
Del Amo Boulevard

Cornelia doesn’t move Riders file out and load on Ruby
begins to rise and go toward Cornelia Then Brian gets up
and makes his way to her first

BRIAN
Hello Ma’am You asked me to let
you know when we were at Del Amo

Cornelia looks up at him An uncertain beat

CORNELIA
Yes Thank you sir

BRIAN
Yes ma’am You live near here

CORNELIA
I do Just up the road

BRIAN
I wish I could take you right up to
your door Let me help you down
these steps

CORNELIA
No thank you kindly I’m fine

Cornelia makes her way to the exit Ruby watches her head up
the street moving to the front of the bus near Brian to keep
an eye on the old woman

RUBY
Has that happened before

BRIAN
Yeah

RUBY
A lot

BRIAN

On and off It just kind of comes
and goes Is it Alzheimers or

RUBY
Well not necessarily It could be
other things

BRIAN
Rough to watch whatever it is

RUBY
Is she going to get home okay I
should follow her

BRIAN
She knows her way She just
forgot

They watch her turn the corner through the window

RUBY
How long have you been driving her

BRIAN
About two years One time she
didn’t ride for a week Then came
back as good as new I asked Metro
and they said if she’s functioning
and isn’t a danger to herself or
other riders wasn’t much I could
do It’s just real tough with her
because when she’s in her right
mind she’s so alive you know
But then she doesn’t know you
and it just breaks your heart

Devastated Ruby knows the feeling

INT RUBY’S PLACE - DAY
A KNOCK at the door Ruby is half-dressed when she answers

RUBY
I’m almost read

She’s stunned to see RASHAD Derek’s friend He’s attractive
enough to distract from a bad attitude and purposely laconic
persona But any woman with sense would know to stay away

RUBY (CONT’D)
(tying her robe)
Rashad I thought you were Rosie

RASHAD
I’m just dropping this off for D

He hands her a thick envelope She hesitates then takes it

RUBY

His parole hearing’s today
RASHAD

Yeah
RUBY

I’1l let you know how it goes

RASHAD
(walking away)
Yeah aight

INT VICTORVILLE HEARINGS ROOM - DAY

Several men and women sit on a panel Ruby and Rosie are in
folding chairs side by side

At the inmate’s table Fraine leafs through a file Ruby
fumbles through her file too A bundle of nerves Rosie
takes her sister’s hand

Ruby squeezes Rosie’s hand and swallows hard This is it
This is the day she’s been praying for

The side door opens and Derek is led in He appears to be
well wearing a dark blue suit

From several rows back Ruby reviews every inch of him He
doesn’t look her way as he takes his seat Concentrating on
what his lawyer is saying

Ruby watches their conference intently but can only see his
profile and the back of his head

TIMECUT
The hearing is underway

FRAINE
Alberta Fraine representing Derek
J Murray P48057 As you know
Mr Murray has served four years
and two months consecutively
without undisputed incident We’re
here today to request a minimum
time served enforcement Mr
Murray is a married man He and
his wife Mrs Roberta M Murray
registrant 051954 were married
prior to his conviction Mrs
Murray who is present here today
is an employed registered nurse who
maintains the couple’s residence
She is in full support of the
minimum release

A man on the panel chimes in

MAN
(impressed)
It’s been awhile Ms Fraine

FRAINE
Yessir hello

MAN
Several things An incident that
just happened last month Clearly
on the facility record

FRAINE
If I may re-state I said
“undisputed” incident Mr Murray
is disputing the facility’s charges
against him for the unfortunate
events of last month He did not
initiate the disruptive activity

MAN
Facility presented tape on this I
saw your client in action The
contraband weapon was
(looking through papers)
» a pipe I think

A pipe Did Ruby hear that right

FRAINE
If I may the recorded angle was
obscured and didn’t allow a full
view of the incident It doesn’t
show that Mr Murray was first
assaulted out of camera range He
was admitted to the medic for the
injury

Derek shifts in his seat

FRAINE (CONTD)
May I remind the board that Mr
Murray has served over four and a
half years without a single
facility charge before the disputed
event He’s one of the good guys

MAN
Block administrators have noted
gang affiliation on this inmate’s
file since his arrival

Ruby has changed The hope on her face replaced by something
almost indecipherable Fear confusion anger

FRAINE
Respectfully every man in here has
gang affiliation My client is not
an active participant in any gang
activity whatsoever No charges
have been filed by the facility at
any point May I submit that when
you are surrounded by gang
activity you become guilty by
association

MAN
What’s this internal disciplinary
warning Two years ago Involving
sexual contact with an officer
Jacinta Sanchez Consensual
contact before she was dismissed

Derek drops his head

ROSIE
What the hell

Ruby blinks back her disbelief Not sure if she heard right
This is not happening She wants to scream but cannot move

FRAINE
Sir the facility did not bring
formal charges against the officer
or my client for the alleged
contact

MAN
(to the panel)
Anything else
(to Fraine)
Okay Ms Fraine Thank you
Please be in touch with the board
on its ruling We’re adjourned

And with that it’s over Fraine whispers to Derek but he
is no longer listening The officer approaches him

Ruby doesn’t take her eyes off him The tension in her body
is palpable Her back erect as she strains to see him around
the officer She’s desperate to make eye contact but Derek
doesn’t look up

He rises from the table and holds out his hands in front of
him The officer handcuffs him and leads him to the door
She follows him with her eyes Willing him to turn Her jaw
clenched Her face in turmoil

In SLOW MOTION he moves toward the exit He is at the door
walking through it

And then the very instant before he disappears on the other
side he LOOKS AT HER

It’s just a moment seemingly all that he can bear But in
that millisecond she sees his shame And he sees what he
didn’t want to Her rage

And then - HE IS GONE

Devastation is not the word Rosie reaches for Ruby and
holds on tight Fraine and others look on Rosie looks
ready to fight them all

Slowly mournfully Ruby buries her head on her sisters
shoulder

INT EMPTY PATIENT ROOM - NIGHT

From the door a SILHOUETTE through the curtain

On the curtain’s other side the vertical blinds cast shadows

across Ruby’s face She sits still on the edge of a neatly-
made bed Quietly imploding

In her hands are a FEW DOZEN PILLS Her face is tear-stained
as she stoically considering what is before her

Then she shovels the pills in her mouth Clenching her eyes
shut and SWALLOWING hard With each passing moment we fear
for her Her expression is inscrutable Sitting on the edge
of the bed Almost catatonic

And then emotion emerges Ever so slight It’s anger She
rises from her place heavy We track her as she crosses the
dark room

The BATHROOM LIGHT flicks on shining through a half-open
door We hear her VOMITING

INT TAXICAB - NIGHT

Ruby rides for a while fighting off her demons as the city
passes outside the window

A freeway sign CRENSHAW BOULEVARD - 4 MILES

The plexiglass of the taxi barrier is dirty and through it
the city lights blur all around her In a haze

Another sign CRENSHAW BOULEVARD - 2 MILES

Her mind is working Deciding Where is she going She
doesn’t know what to do Then a snap decision

The cab comes upon another sign CRENSHAW BOULEVARD - EXIT

RUBY
(almost to herself)
Can you get off here

CABBIE
Huh

RUBY
I changed my mind Crenshaw and
Leimert please

She pulls off her scrub top and stuffs it into her bag She
adjusts her wifebeater undershirt then pulls out a lipgloss
Checking her REFLECTION in the window

EXT LEIMERT PARK - NIGHT
Ruby arrives at Leimert Park an artsy area in South Central

LA We see folks dining out at THE KITCHEN and catching some
jazz at THE WORLD Men playing chess under a streetlamp

A group of cool-looking people stand outside a hole-in-the-
wall joint It’s JUJU

Then with a deep breath she walks towards the club

EXT JUJU - CONTINUOUS

We hear BJORK singing over KRS-1’s “Jack of Spades” beat A
brother with cornrows hustles indie CDs and more

BROTHER
All the local favs ya’ll CVE
Hip Hop Klan Chali2na Abstract
Medusa Aceyalone Figures of
Speech Classic Good Life LA
underground ya’ll

INT JUJU - CONTINUOUS

A woman wearing an Indian sari over jeans enforces the cover
charge from her perch on a high stool

Ruby ventures deeper inside the cozy space Folks are
grooving to the music chilling on couches along the walls

A FEMALE DEEJAY is atop a small stage like a queen on a
throne Her subjects bob their dreads braids and ‘fros in
praise of what she’s spinning

Ruby spies Brian across the room immersed in a serious game
of DOMINOES As she approaches he sees her and lights up
with surprise She smiles back approaching him

RUBY
Hi
BRIAN
(rising from his seat)
Hi

RUBY
You were right

BRIAN
About what

She holds up her hand showing her ring He takes her hand

BRIAN (CONT’D)
Okay It’s okay

TIMECUT

They are on the jam-packed dance floor getting their groove
on With a drink in one hand Ruby lets her hair down
literally with the other hand

A couple nearby is cutting a serious rug maybe too serious
These over-the-top dancers have everyone around them in awe

Brian begins to mimic the guy She’s almost in tears with
laughter

The song changes to a sultry electronic instrumental She
boldly slips her hand down to the small of his back as they
sway together

INT BRIAN’S TRUCK - NIGHT

Ruby and Brian ride in his F150 The RADIO is on She’s
full of liquid courage He seems a little nervous

BRIAN
I don’t get over to this side of
town too much Nice little pocket
What bus you take at night

RUBY
Two actually The 117 and the 210

BRIAN
Then you know Robrico

RUBY
Been riding with him for years

BRIAN
Good guy huh

RUBY
Yeah he’s a sweetheart

His cell phone RINGS

BRIAN
Hello Beautiful

Ruby reacts but hides it well She turns toward the window
wishing she could make herself invisible

BRIAN (CONTD)
Good good I’11 be late tonight
(listening then smiling)
Okay you get that beauty sleep
I’1l call you tomorrow
(MORE)

BRIAN (CONT’D)
(listening)
Love you too

He hangs up Ruby wants to open the door and jump out

BRIAN
Got kids

RUBY
Huh Oh no No I don’t You

BRIAN
A little girl Well not little
anymore 15 That was the nightly
call that costs me 60 a month on
the new cell phone that I got
hustled into buying
feminine voice)
“Daddy I need to call and check on
you every night I worry about you
drivin’ the streets”
back to normal)
That girl’s got me wrapped around
her little finger

Ruby ventures out

RUBY
I’m sure her mother had something
to say about that

BRIAN

Oh I’m sure she did too But she

doesn’t speak to me so whatever it

was she said it to somebody else
EXTINT BRIAN’S TRUCK - NIGHT
The truck pulls to the curb From inside Ruby looks up at
her apartment as Brian walks around to open her door But
when he opens it she doesn’t move

She motions for him to “come here” He does ducking inside

Face to face She leans over and KISSES him Tentatively at
first And then more

He leans into the car holding her hips and trying to keep
his balance A CAR DRIVES BY and they come up for air

He is searching her eyes trying to figure out what’s next

RUBY
Let’s go somewhere

BRIAN
What about here

RUBY
Not here

INT BRIAN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

His apartment is a small open space with floor to ceiling
windows The amber light of the street lamps stream through
the blinds casting shadows on the scarcely furnished room

She sees her reflection in the window The wind blows paper
bags and soda cans on the street several hundred feet below
She watches them dance placing her hand on the glass

BRIAN
You should see my old house
Plush This neighborhood sucks and
the building’s falling apart but
the view
She turns her back on the city and focuses on him

BRIAN
(with new meaning)
The view is amazing
Not there to talk she walks towards him

He wraps his arms around her Hers wrap around him And
unexpectedly they stay that way for a while

TIMECUT
She lays away from him as he sleeps watching the sun rising
over the buildings through the window Alone with her
thoughts She tries to figure out how to feel Then he
puts his hand on her side

BRIAN
Don’t think

He moves behind her holding her She leans back and rests

INT MONTAGE

We see the things rarely seen after a night like this

Leaving the apartment together awkwardly Driving in the
car side by side He swerves into Krispy Kreme They eat
doughnuts in the car as she empties packets of sugar into
their coffee He pulls up to her apartment

She exits the car and gives him a quick peck before heading
upstairs to her place

EXTINT RUBY’S PLACE - MORNING

She enters her apartment slowly Then turns on the answering
machine Standing still she surveys her home her life

She leans back against the wall and slides down until she is
a jumble on the floor Her arms are around her knees She
looks at nothing in particular completely absorbed in the
memory of her intimate encounter and what it all means

We see what she feels DEREK sitting across from her
watching

EXT ROSIE’S PLACE - DAY

The sisters sit on Rosie’s small balcony flipping through
circulars in the Sunday paper

ROSIE
I don’t even know what she likes

RUBY
You know exactly what she likes
Why you trying to act like you
don’t talk to her everyday still

ROSIE
I don’t Maybe every other day
But its just cause she’s always
calling and coming by It’s her
birthday Otherwise I wouldn’t -

RUBY
Give it up co-dependent

ROSIE
She’s trying to apologize in her
own special jacked up way Look at
this

Rosie shows her a picture from a catalog

RUBY
That looks like you
ROSIE
It needs to look like you Men
like red Attracts their eye
(beat)
My treat For when you’re ready

RUBY
I kinda went out the other night

ROSIE
What Where You didn’t call me

RUBY
It was spur of the moment To this
little lounge I met up with
Brian You remember him

ROSIE
You met up with him

RUBY
We danced And he took me home

ROSIE
You danced and he took you home
What’s that mean

RUBY
Doesn’t mean anything

ROSIE
You kiss him
(off Ruby’s nod)
I’1l be damned Hells yes

RUBY
Don’t

ROSIE
The past is past The future is
kinda cute with a good job

RUBY
It was a one time thing

ROSIE
Why dude Why can’t you do you

RUBY
‘Cause I can’t

ROSIE
Derek’s doing his thing Clearly
He ain’t thinking about you
RUBY
(hurt )
Don’t

Rosie lets it go

INT RUBY’S PLACE - NIGHT

Ruby irons getting ready for work The cell phone rings

The screen reads “Victorville CTF”

She doesn’t answer One ring Two Three Four

She dials into her voicemail

DEREK

(on message)
I only got a few minutes on this
card I know you’re there Fourth
message I know you’re sitting
right there You don’t want to
talk to me You shouldn’t want to
You shouldn’t have ever wanted to
I’m sorry for what I’ve done to

beginning I knew better Maybe

right thing now

(with difficulty)
Okay

(beat)
Okay

The phone clicks off Off Ruby in pain

INT BRIAN’S BUS - MORNING

Cornelia and Ruby sit together on the hot bus
It’s a good day for the old woman Back to her

RUBY
How was service this morning

CORNELIA
Oh pastor had a powerful sermon
Said we have to find the um
what was it the private wish
That’s something we really want
deep down but we think we don’t
deserve

(MORE)

Knitting
old self

ee FH FH FH HF

CORNELIA (contd)
Said to ask yourself what makes you
happy and see if it’s the same
thing that makes God happy

RUBY
I see

CORNELIA
I could want to streak across this
bus because this heat isn’t making
me too happy right now But would
that make God happy God would
say “Cornelia sweetpea put your
clothes on please”

Ruby chuckles with Cornelia She catches Brian watching them
through his REARVIEW

CORNELIA (CONTD)
Pastor says you should treat
yourself sweet like a baby I
liked that

RUBY
That’s a nice thought

The women’s knitting hooks dance in a familiar rhythm

CORNELIA
Yes a nice thought I’m going to
try hard to remember it

Ruby looks to Cornelia who returns her gaze Cornelia knows
what is happening to her It passes between them unspoken

CORNELIA
Shoot if I had a private wish I
made it true I wished I could
travel and see things and I did
I wished I had a little piece of
the world just for me a house and
I had that If I want to go to
service every single night I’1ll do
it I want to watch David
Letterman and eat Oreos in bed
I’11 do that too

RUBY
Is that the kind of wish he was
talking about The Oreo wish

CORNELIA
Honey I don’t know but I got happy
anyway What’s your wish

RUBY
Oh I don’t know

CORNELIA
Well what makes you happy

Ruby thinks and shrugs

CORNELIA
C’mon
A beat
RUBY
My nephew
CORNELIA

Okay how old is he

RUBY
He’s five

CORNELIA

That’s a beautiful age isn’t it
See you have something

(beat)
You know it’s not really still a
private wish if you tell me Then
it’d be a public wish I don’t
know the rules exactly but private
is private

Cornelia pats Ruby’s hand letting her off the hook Ruby
nods soothed by the old woman’s attention

INT BRIAN’S BUS - MORNING

Brian’s bus sits at the curb It’s the end of the line The
few remaining passengers spill out Ruby remains in her
seat Brian flicks a SILVER LEVER shutting them in as the
doors slide close Picking up a soda can and newspaper as he
walks toward her She watches him

BRIAN
This seat taken

She motions for him to sit next to her

BRIAN
I kept waiting for you to change
your mind and get off somewhere
(then )
I been thinking about you all day

RUBY
Is that a problem

BRIAN
Uh yeah kinda

RUBY
Why’s that

BRIAN
‘Cause about a dozen people
probably got themselves free rides
today And ‘cause I’m on city
property with a vixen next to me

RUBY
Vixen Good word

He leans in to kiss her It’s more tender than she expected

BRIAN
Want to see a movie this weekend
Dont say you’re working

RUBY
I don’t know if we like the same
kind of movies

BRIAN
What kind do you like
RUBY
Indie ones Foreign ones
BRIAN
Movies where a brother’s got to
read
RUBY

Yeah those

BRIAN
I can swing with subtitles

RUBY
They play on the Westside mostly
They don’t show them over here

He gently brushes a strand of hair from her face

BRIAN
It’s not a problem

EXT CITY STREET - DAY

Ruby and Nickie walk together on a sunny afternoon Fast
food signs and beauty shops call out from every corner

As she stops to buy a newspaper Nickie watches a teenager
exchange something small with a man The teen’s eyes dart
left and right until they land on Nickie Nickie smiles at
him innocent The teenager smiles a real smile back

Ruby follows her nephew’s eyes then immediately takes his
hand in hers and crosses the street

NICKIE
Aunt Rube

RUBY
Hmm

NICKIE

Why don’t you care about Grammie
She slows her pace and leans into him

RUBY
What’d you say Pop

NICKIE
Why don’t you care about Grammie

RUBY
I do care about Grammie I love
Grammie

NICKIE
Okay

RUBY

What made you think that I don’t
care about her

NICKIE
Grammie said

RUBY
Grammmie said I didn’t care about
her

NICKIE
Yes

RUBY

Well she made a mistake okay

NICKIE
Okay She said you only care
about Uncle Derek I told her it’s
because he’s at the war

RUBY
I love everybody the same Pop
You your Mom Grammie Uncle
Derek Everybody the same Okay

NICKIE
Okay Is he nice

RUBY
Yeah He’s nice

NICKIE

(a beat as she remembers)
He likes to play outside
Basketball and stuff He likes to
cook He’s a real real good cook

NICKIE
What does he make

RUBY
Oh he makes everything He makes
good gumbo Delicious With crab
and shrimp and And he makes
very good tacos

NICKIE
When is Uncle Derek coming home

RUBY
I don’t know Pop
INT ROSIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rosie quietly shuts Nickie’s door and creeps into the dark
living room lit only by the TELEVISION

Ruby reclines in an overstuffed chair watching MO’NIQUE
lulled into a latenight haze Rosie falls onto the couch

RUBY
He asked me about Derek today

ROSIE
Ugh Sorry

RUBY
He just asked what he liked to do
Couldn’t tell him Uncle Derek does
dirt while Aunt Rube watches
Doesn’t go over well with the kids

Rosie looks over at Ruby who keeps her eyes on the screen

ROSIE
So that’s the new thing You
watched

Ruby keeps her eyes on the TV

ROSIE (CONTD)
Maybe it’s healthy to make excuses
I don’t know But I think it’s
pretty simple He messed up and
they locked him up Period

RUBY
Every month he’d be gone four five
days What’d I think He and
Rashad were really going to visit
“friends” Always helping somebody
move to a new city That condo
All that furniture The new truck
I wasn’t blind

ROSIE
You believed what he told you How
is that your fault

RUBY
I knew something wasn’t right I
ignored it I wanted everything we
had I let him think I could only
be happy with all that stuff
That’s on me

ROSIE
You’re here blaming yourself while
he’s in there doing God knows what
Is whoring with a guard your fault
too That’s just taking it too
far I mean c’mon Get a grip

RUBY
I don’t think you’re not ina
position to give advice about
relationships so don’t

Her words bruise as soon as they’re spoken

RUBY (CONTD)
I didn’t mean that

ROSIE
It’s cool You’re right I don’t
know a thing about relationships
I haven’t had one man whose stayed
in my life like you’ve had When
he got locked up I actually had
this crazy thought that at least
she’s got someone who would care if
she disappeared Even if he is
locked up she’s got somebody who
could say I remember you when you
were beautiful and young And who
would always see that in you
That’s not happening for me I
have to see it in myself But at
least I see it dude You can’t
see two feet in front of you

With that Rosie turns up the volume on the TV

INT MOVIE THEATER - DAY
Ruby and Brian sit side by side watching the big screen

IN THE FILM a black man in his thirties sits shirtless on
the edge of a bed He strokes the arm of a plain white woman
in her sixties dressed in a nightgown The scene appears
oddly platonic as if he is comforting her after a hard day

Then the film jump cuts to the next morning Obviously
postcoital The old woman stands over the bed as she watches
the young man sleep

BRIAN
What the Did

Brian turns to Ruby at a loss for words

BRIAN
Did they just Did

Ruby is amused by his reaction

BRIAN
Ah nah What kinda movie you got
me up in I didn’t agree to
this

EXT MOVIE THEATER - LATER

A MOVIEHOUSE on the Westside a predominantly white area
The marque reads “ALI FEAR EATS THE SOUL”

Ruby and Brian stroll out in the midst of a conversation

BRIAN
I get that I understand what
they’re trying to say but it
wasn’t realistic

RUBY
It’s not about being realistic
It’s making a point Showing you
something so far out of bounds that
it makes you think

BRIAN
And I appreciate that But the
point could have been better made
if she wasn’t like that old
Cmon Of course the first thing
you think is he’s hustling her

RUBY
He gives her money

BRIAN
I know That’s when I’m thinking
“Brother what’s really going on”

RUBY
He was an outcast Everybody
treated him like less except her

BRIAN
Okay yes I get that But why
does he go in her bedroom

RUBY
That’s all he had to give

BRIAN
Nah I don’t buy it I understand
the premise okay I read it all
just like you did But ain’ta
brother in his right mind getting
down like that I don’t care if
people treat you like nothing She
was damn near 70 something years
old There wasn’t a real future
with her

RUBY
She wasn’t 70 And what 70 years
old don’t have a future And
maybe it wasn’t about a future
Maybe it was about the past - what
they had gone through - and how
they were dealing with it

BRIAN
Everything’s about the future

He grabs her hand and they walk across the street Then

RUBY
Youre not going to ask me about my
situation

BRIAN
I figure you’1ll tell me when you
want me to know My wife My ex
hated that Letting people just
say what they want to say when they
want to say it Radical She
thought it meant I didn’t care
because I didn’t ask her a thousand
questions

RUBY
Well you need to know that I’m
married That I’ve been separated
from my husband for about 5 years
And that with him I don’t know
what’s going to happen next

BRIAN
Okay And you need to know that
I’m going to try to be what’s
happening next

And with that he opens the door to his truck A beat as she
hesitates still processing what he’s said She climbs in
He closes the door with confidence

INT RUTH’S HOUSE - EVENING

The table is set with birthday decor Close on Nickie as he
plays with his food It’s quiet except for the sounds of
KNIVES and FORKS in motion He seems used to it Then we see
Ruth Rosie and Ruby eating in uncomfortable silence

RUTH
I thought this might be nice at
least for my birthday

(MORE)
RUTH (contd)
But it’s obvious that you two don’t
want to be here

RUBY
Of course we want to be here Ma

RUTH
Well you wouldn’t know it
Someone looking in the window would
think we’re three strangers sitting
here
(beat)
Why are we like this

Ruby and Rosie look at each other waiting

RUTH (CONTD)

I’d like to know I‘d like to know
why sitting together and having a
meal like a family is so painful
Why I’m not allowed to even babysit
my Own grandson

ROSIE
Here we go

RUTH
Yes that’s right Here we go I
wanna know

NICKIE
I wanna know

ROSIE
Nicholas watch yourself

RUTH
Don’t do that to him Let him
speak That’s how he learns

ROSIE
If I’d said that when I was his
age I would have been smacked
across the mouth

RUTH
I know what my mistakes were
Rosie You don’t have to make the
same ones

ROSIE
Trust me I’m not

RUTH
You are It’s not supposed to be
like this One person having to do
everything One young woman
Having to do it all I used to
pray for somebody to help me But
there was nobody I’m here Why
don’t you let me

ROSIE
Ma please

RUTH
Nobody’s talking bad about you
Rosie Whatever you have in your
head that I said about you or think
about you The boy has eyes and
ears He knows you’re struggling
Don’t fool yourself thinking he
doesn’t know I did that I was
too busy trying to put gas in the
car I didn’t take those few extra
minutes to listen To answer So
you found all kinds of answers from
other people Both of you That’s
why you’re in the situations you’re
in now I don’t want that to
happen to this boy

ROSIE
Situations Nice

RUTH
Yes situations Single with a
baby and no money struggling just
to make it
(to Ruby)
And

Ruth just shakes her head

RUBY
Beyond description

RUTH
Every year it’s next year with you
For the job the car It’s always
soon But soon never comes with
you And med school well no
one even brings that up anymore
You sit by the phone in a dark
apartment waiting for that Negro to
call you From prison Prison
Ruby
Nickie reacts quietly

RUBY
I’m trying my best Ma

RUTH
This is not your best You don’t
have anything to say if it’s not
about him Your head used to be
filled with things “Ma read this
article This poem This book”
We couldn’t shut you up Now all
you talk about is him All you
read about is who broke up with who
and who went to what party and you
don’t know none of ‘em What is
that

Nickie begins to tear up Rosie picks him up

ROSIE
Ma leave her alone

RUTH
Nothing to say right

RUBY
I don’t know Ma

RUTH
“T don’t know Ma” So I win
“Im sorry Ma That’s all you

ever say That’s all I can get
from you Why don’t you ever say
anything anymore Ruby

RUBY
What are you talking about Ma

RUTH
Say something

NICKIE
(crying)
Don’t do that

Rosie rises and carries Nickie out of the room

RUBY
What do you want to me say

Ruby stands from the table Ruth follows

RUTH
Anything My expectations are so
low I’1l take anything from you at
this point

Ruby’s fuse is lit

RUTH (CONT’D)
You don’t have anything to say to
this No thoughts Nothing going
on upstairs anymore
(then)
Speak up Ruby This is not you
Speak up for yourself Can’t you --

RUBY
I’m done

Ruth is taken aback by the power in her daughter’s voice
Strong and clear

RUBY
I’m done with this

Ruby picks up her purse and leaves Ruth watches - pained
but proud

INT PATIENT ROOM - NIGHT

Ruby administers IV medication A nurse’s assistant enters

NURSE’S ASSISTANT
Someone here for you

INT VISITOR’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Ruby finds Rashad in a black leather coat and his usual
scornful expression

Ruby closes the door behind them in the empty visitor’s room
Rashad stands before her dripping with attitude

RUBY
(concerned)
What’s up

RASHAD
What’s up with you

RUBY
What’re you talking about
RASHAD
What the fuck are you doing

RUBY
Excuse me

RASHAD
You telling him or I’m telling him

Rashad stares her down He knows

RASHAD (CONTD)
You telling him or I’m telling him

A beat as they glare at each other

RUBY
I’1l tell him

RASHAD
He’s calling me everyday asking
what’s up with you Is she okay
Go check on her And you up here
with some fool who drives a bus
Aint even trying to hide

RUBY
You don’t know what you’re talking
about

RASHAD

You foul that’s what I’m talking
about I always knew it but he’s
always trying to convince somebody
you a fucking queen or some shit

I knew this was gonna happen He’s
making me give you more money
convince you to take a fucking
phone call From your own husband
And you up in his bed

RUBY
I never brought anybody to our bed

RASHAD
Oh that’s better

RUBY
It’s a difference

RASHAD
I’m glad this is about to be over

RUBY
Be clear It’s over when I say
it’s over You don’t know me You
don’t know nothing about us If
you knew half of what you think you
know you wouldn’t be up in my
face

Ruby turns for the door incensed

RASHAD
You talkin’ to my man or what

RUBY
I’1l talk to my man when I’m good
and damn well ready

And with that she’s gone

EXT BUSYARD - NIGHT

Rows and rows of buses are parked recuperating from another
day Drivers head out of a small building Ruby watches
from the employee parking lot near Brian’s truck He heads
towards it in a quiet but stern cell phone conversation As
he gets closer WE HEAR HIM

BRIAN
(on the phone)
You want to throw this family away
that’s up to you

He listens then reacts He is at the truck now but doesn’t
see Ruby on the other side She regrets being there

BRIAN
I didn’t throw it away What else
can I do How many ways can I say
it I didn’t ever want this This
is all you You’re the one who
can’t forgive

Whatever was said on the other line was quick because one
second later he BANGS HIS FIST on the hood of his truck
Ruby emerges from the darkness

Startled he looks at her on the verge of exploding

BRIAN
You scared me

RUBY
What’d she say

BRIAN
What
RUBY
You said “You can’t forgive”
What’d she say
BRIAN
“But I can forget”
INT RUBY’S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING
Morning light seeps into the room Ruby sits on the edge of
her bed her hands clasped in prayer Everything about her
screams regret
Then we discover Brian asleep on the rumpled sheets She
stands over him considering this man with some sadness
Pulls a sheet over his shoulder then looks around the
bedroom
On her night stand is a FRAMED PHOTO of her and Derek At
that moment the image is unbearable She slowly turns away
then heads into the bathroom From the half-opened door we
HEAR THE WATER of the shower
INT RUBY’S BEDROOM - LATER
The PHONE RINGS Once
Brian stirs in the bed

The PHONE RINGS Twice

He turns over and finds that Ruby isn’t there Looks to the
bathroom door The SHOWER IS STILL ON

On the third ring he reaches for her phone on the
nightstand The screen reads “VICTORVILLE USF”

Brian sits up in the bed staring at it as it rings again

INT RUBY’S LIVING ROOM - A SHORT WHILE LATER

Ruby in a robe standing at the bedroom door watching Brian
holding her cell phone

RUBY
Hey

BRIAN
Whose in Victorville

RUBY
My husband

BRIAN
What’d he do

RUBY
Guns

BRIAN
How long’s he got

RUBY
A while longer

BRIAN
Like what

RUBY
Four more years or something

BRIAN
And youre staying with him

Ruby doesn’t respond

BRIAN (CONTD)
We’ve got something Don’t we

RUBY
Yes

BRIAN
We could have a life

RUBY
I know

BRIAN
You still love him

A beat

BRIAN
Well I still love my wife But
its not happening It’s not going
to happen You and me - we could
happen

She doesn’t have a response to this His declaration hangs
in the air For a moment too long

Then he walks past her and into the bedroom Coming out
moments later Buttoning his shirt

BRIAN (CONTD)
You think he’s going to get out and
you live happily ever after

RUBY
I don’t know

Disappointed he nods and walks through the front door

EXT BUSTOP - DAY

Cornelia sits at a bus stop on a treelined street Ruby
approaches Unsure of who she’1l find

She sits on the bus bench next to the old woman who looks up
and smiles politely NO RECOGNITION At this Ruby’s eyes
well with tears

CORNELIA
Oh no No No What’s wrong Oh
my goodness Are you okay

The tears spill forward softly Ruby nods yes Cornelia
moves to comfort her placing her hand on Ruby’s

CORNELIA
Oh it’s okay It’s going to be
okay

Ruby looks at Cornelia Crushed at the thought of this woman
falling apart Devastated at the shambles of her own life

CORNELIA
Where do you live Sweetpea

RUBY
Cornelia

CORNELIA
It’s okay Don’t you worry

Cornelia brushes away her tears A gesture that makes Ruby’s
heart ache and soar at the same time

EXT RUBY’S APARTMENT - DAY

It’s a windy day Ruby sits huddled on the steps wrestling

with her yarn Deep in thought The trees sway back and
forth above her waving her in their direction

INT NURSES LOUNGE - NIGHT

Ruby sits at the table writing a letter

INT RUBY’S PLACE - NIGHT

She is at her desk gathering papers

EXT STREET CORNER - EARLY MORNING

It’s early in the morning The sky is cloudless still a
dark blue Ruby slides a large envelope in public mailbox
and drops it in

INT VICTORVILLE VISITING ROOM - DAY

Derek walks through the doors with a soft expression
Thrilled to see her but keeping his composure They
exchange a heartfelt hug Then sit across from each other

DEREK
I missed you

RUBY
I missed you too

DEREK
I’m sorry - about everything

RUBY
I know you are Me too

DEREK
You got nothing to be sorry about
I got caught up I don’t want you
to think of me like this In here
Being this way I wanted to make
you feel like everything was okay
but it never was Not since the
day I walked in here I gota
better handle on things now though
I’m turning it all around Things
are different now I promise you

RUBY
Theyre different for me too

A beat as she considers what she’s about to do She
memorizes him Her husband The man she’s been waiting for -
for four years The man she has loved more than herself

RUBY (CONTD)
I tried

He searches her eyes trying to decipher what that means

RUBY (CONTD)
I tried really hard

Fearing the worst he begins to speak She beats him to it

RUBY (CONT’D)
You’re not the only one who made
mistakes I made a lot This is
not how we’re supposed to be
living Betraying each other

He reacts to her revelation A deep pain washes over him

RUBY (CONTD)
I’m not giving up on you I told
you I wouldn’t and I wont

DEREK
(stunned)
I don’t know what you’re saying

RUBY
I’m saying I won’t be here next
Saturday Or the Saturday after
that Or after that I’m not
going to do another four years with
you

He has no words Does he fight her Or let her go He
can’t decide And doesn’t know what to say

RUBY (CONT’D)
I mailed you all the paperwork on
your case Everything’s in there
for when you’re ready to do what
you need to do Not when I want
you to but when you’re ready You
can survive this and be a better
man for it I believe that

(nodding to others)

Maybe he can’t Or he can’t But
I know you I know the best you

They study each other Each untangling memories
expectations

RUBY (CONT’D)
This woman I know this great woman
I know told me - when he’s there
he’s there And that’ll be good
if it happens But when he’s not
there - she told me to live my day
I need to do that

She leans forward and touches his face taking him off guard
Tracing his jawline and cheekbones His eyelids His lips
He wants to resist her but can’t

RUBY (CONTD)
She told me to say something sweet
then - go about my business

She smiles with some sadness Then she slides off her seat
and moves to him In one smooth motion she is on his lap

He looks at her eyes glassy But he won’t let them fall

She leans in their lips almost touching He pulls away a
bit to look at the guards who are oblivious for the moment
She gently turns his face to hers He gets it The guards
don’t matter to her anymore This is goodbye

So he reaches for her Holding her face in his hands He
whispers “I’m sorry” And then a loving perfect kiss
Soul-stirring Something to remember

Inmates HOOP and HOLLER Officers rush across the room

SLOW MOTION All the activity around them is a blur for the
few moments before the guards reach them The kiss blossoms
into an embrace Filled with emotion Their bodies saying
everything they can’t articulate They cling to each other
She tells him she loves him Their faces so close Savoring
the moment The intimacy Then it’s over

Ruby and Derek still holding each other are SURROUNDED

water with a garden hose
