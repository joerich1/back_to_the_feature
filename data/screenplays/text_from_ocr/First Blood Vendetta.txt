EXT ROUTE 66 - DAY

In bg a distant figure simmering and wavering in the heat
haze of the day

In the fg is a ROAD SIGN
‘Route 66’
CREDIT SEQUENCE - EARLY MORNING

A LONELY FIGURE walks the old highway alone with the
occasional car WHIZZING past him

He is wearing an old 70s style army jacket and a large
backpack is slung over his shoulder His hair is long and
unkempt

His name is JOHN RAMBO

Rambo hears a CAR pull up behind him and turns

CU ON CAR DOOR

to see that it’s a police car for Navajo county

It is slowly accompanying Rambo as he is walking by the side
of the road

Rambo is getting nervous
PAUSE CREDITS

The window goes down and a head pokes out The head belongs
to a deputy called WEAVER

WEAVER
Hey Buddy Wanna ride
RAMBO
(hesitant)
Eh It’s OK officer Just passing
through
WEAVER

Holbrook is still about 10 miles up
ahead Let me do my good deed for
the day and take you to town
RAMBO
Thank you officer but I could do
with the exercise Like I said I’m
just passing through
WEAVER
(puzzled)
Oh well Just trying to give you
a break Have a nice day sir
The police car drives off ahead Rambo looks ahead He has a
feeling of deja vu
CREDITS ROLL AGAIN

EXT HOLBROOK - LATER

John Rambo is walking towards a road sign

CU ROAD SIGN
‘Welcome to Holbrook’

Rambo walks through an underpass where the two main highways
intersected

After coming out the other side he sees workmen doing road
maintenance There are traffic cones and barriers up all
along this part of road

Rambo looks to his left after coming out the other side of
the underpass and sees a couple of the workmen digging a
TRENCH in the dirt

There is a LARGE TARP all rolled up by where the workmen are
digging Rambo walks on

SERIES OF SHOTS

Rambo walks down Navajo Boulevard

SHOTS of different parts of town as Rambo walks on
Large replica DINOSAURS in almost every yard

Now on West Hopi drive we see the Wigwam Motel and all it’s
CLASSIC VINTAGE CARS

After passing by a few diners Rambo finds one that is almost
empty
Rambo peers through the glass and decides this place would be
as good as any

PAUSE CREDITS

IE DINER - DAY

The diner has that fifties retro look except for the flat
screen in the top corner perched high on the wall There is a
DAYTIME SOAP playing low in the background that nobody is
paying any attention to

The interior is made up of plenty of polished chrome and
bright plastic a LARGE MIRROR behind the counter and bar
stools guarding the length of the long counter

There are adjoining booths all along the length of the wall
opposite the main counter

RAMBO POV

sees an empty booth at the far end against both the side and
back wall of the establishment

He walks over and takes off his pack and shoves it under the
table against the wall He sits on the outer seat with his
back to the wall facing the rest of the diner and the
entrance

It’s Rambo’s natural instinct to be on his guard at all
times it’s drilled into him to be cautious

He picks up the menu and browses the small selection decides
what he wants and puts the menu back in it’s stand

A YOUNG WAITRESS approaches

WAITRESS
Are you ready to order sir

RAMBO
Yeah I’1l just have the eggs on
a bagel with a large coffee please

WAITRESS
(scribbling down order)
Is that all

RAMBO
Yeah
The waitress makes her way back to the counter and SHOUTS
Rambo’s order to the kitchen staff

RAMBO POV

sees a MAN sitting at the bar with his back to him he has a
large green jacket on which is strange for the middle of
July in Arizona

His hand is constantly touching his left side under his arm

The only other customers are 2 OLD WOMEN sitting at the first
booth from the entrance They are deep in conversation

WIDE SHOT

of the counter with the man with his back to the camera but
the camera ANGLES ON the mirror’s reflection of the man’s
face looking back at Rambo behind him

INT DINER - LATER

After finishing his meal Rambo gets up and leaves some money
on the table He grabs his backpack from under the table and
turns to leave

As he swings the pack over his shoulder he glances at the
MIRROR behind the bar

CLOSE UP ON MAN’S REFLECTION

The man’s eyes narrow

REVERSE BACK TO RAMBO

as he looks suspiciously back

Walking past the man Rambo can see that the guy is carrying
a CONCEALED WEAPON

His hand has been constantly making quick almost unconscious
adjustments to his side ever since Rambo entered the diner
The man is wearing a shoulder holster

The man is also reeking of alcohol and with about 3 days of
stubble on his face

RAMBO’S POV

as he looks down to the man’s left inside wrist to see part
of a faded black TATTOO
He instantly recognizes the bottom part of the sword’s handle
with one of the 3 lightening strikes through it

“Special Forces Airborne”
Rambo walks towards the exit

One of the two old ladies looks up and gives Rambo a dirty
glare and WHISPERS something to her friend

Rambo exits the diner and continues his journey out of town

CREDITS BEGIN TO ROLL AGAIN

EXT DIRT ROAD - DAY

After walking for many miles he comes to a small trail
branching off to the right off the dirt road

He pauses a moment then looks at the mailbox nailed to a
wooden post planted in the hardened earth
CU ON MAILBOX

“RAMBO”

CU ON RAMBO’S FACE

RAMBO
(nervously)
Home sweet home

CREDITS END
He breathes a long breath in and exhales slowly Stares down
the lane to the farm house in the distance and slowly

proceeds on

In the bg Rambo is walking away from the CAMERA down a dirt
road but in the fg a red pick-up truck pulls into frame

The FIGURE in the truck is watching Rambo intensely as he
walks away down the narrow dirt path When Rambo is out of
sight the figure turns back to the wheel revealing he is
the same man from the diner

He drives off

CUT TO
INT FARM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

POV OF THE DIRTY WINDOW

of the farm house as Rambo walks into FRAME

Rambo stops in the middle of the yard in front of the house
He looks around and stares at the house but doesn’t move
EXT FARM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

RAMBO’S POV

as he looks over to the barn and sees that the doors are
padlocked shut

INT FARM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

POV OF THE WINDOW

Suddenly a DARK FIGURE moves in the fg in front of the
dirty glass

The SHADOWY SILHOUETTE has what looks like a SHOTGUN in his
hand

He then moves away

EXT FARM HOUSE - SAME TIME

Rambo is standing in front of the house He notices movement
through one of the windows but he doesn’t move

VOICE (0S)
(angrily)
Get the hell off my land

RAMBO
I’m looking for Rowtag Rambo

VOICE (0S)
Didn’t you hear me the first
time Get the fuck off my land or
I’m gonna fill you with holes

RAMBO
Does Rowtag Rambo live here
VOICE (0S)
I’m gonna give you 5 seconds to
turn around and go back from where
you came 1234

RAMBO
Hey My name is John Rambo I was
told that Rowtag Rambo still lives
here All I want to know is what
happened to my father

There is a few seconds of silence from the cottage and then
the sound of the door being unlatched from within

Door opens to reveal an ELDERLY MAN of Navajo descent with a
shotgun in his hand He stands there and looks back at Rambo

ELDERLY MAN
(Shocked)
John Is that really you

RAMBO
(happiness)
Dad

RAMBO moves closer instinctively to the front of the porch
and stares at the old man His old man

RAMBO (CONTD)
(Relief)
Dad I can’t believe it’s you

Rambo breaks down in tears His father Rowtag staggers back
in shock and almost falls over but with his lightning
reflexes Rambo moves in to put both of his arms around his
father to save him from falling

They both look at each other in disbelief

ROWTAG
(tearful)
I thought you were dead son
(beat)
Where have you been Why did you
leave it so long to come back home

RAMBO
It’s been a long journey but it’s
over now

CUT TO
INT LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The cottage is dark and unkempt Dust is everywhere The
walls are covered with old photos of young soldiers in
uniforms from the past

There is a picture of a young Navajo man in American military
uniform during the 2nd World War Maybe a reference to the
Navajo Code Talkers in WW2

There is also a picture of Rambo’s old Special Forces squad
There are military honors and awards filling cabinets and
shelves and college football trophies on the fireplace and a
scaled down model of a motorcycle - a 1972 Harley Davidson
XR750

There are also pictures of Native American Indians from
almost a century ago on the walls and in picture frames on
tables and shelves Silver Conchos litter the living area On
the floor are several rugs of Navajo design with dragonflies
and Teec Nos Pos patterns

The two men are seated opposite each other both looking down
to the floor not really knowing where to begin They both
have so many questions

ROWTAG
So tell me your story

RAMBO
(solemn )
I don’t know where to begin

ROWTAG

Well try because we have a lot of
catching up to do son and I
ain’t got forever

(beat)
How about when you left us and
never returned - that is until
today

RAMBO

I’m sorry dad I meanit was
too soon for me to just flick a
switch and become normal again
after everything I’ve had been
through I had to leave I didn’t
want to hurt you or mom I wasn’t
able to control myself most of the
time If I had stayed something
would have happened I knew it was
for the best if I just left

ROWTAG
There was a woman that came by here
a few months past She told me you
were living out in Thailand or
something Helping people out

RAMBO
Been living in Thailand a lot of
years

ROWTAG

(shaking his head in

frustration)
Youve been away for a lifetime and
just like that you show up at my
door now

(tearful)
A ghost For more than thirty years
youve been dead to me that was
until that woman showed up and told
me all about you

RAMBO
I know me turning up like this is a
shock for you dad But after years
of living in solitude I just felt
that I had to see you at least one
last time I realized it wasn’t
just about me anymore but it was
about being part of a family again
The more I looked at it
(tearful)
The more I realized I was being
selfish You had a right to know
too I thought that I had left it
too late I was worried that youd

be gone
ROWTAG
No I’m still here
(laughs )

Although some hoped I was long
gone by now

Rambo gets up and walks to the wall

RAMBO POV
CU on a picture of his old unit

Pictures of his Mom and Dad

Then he stares at the old pictures of Navajo Indians hunting
and riding horses

Rambo smiles

RAMBO
I remember the day when you took me
out hunting for the first time back
in Bowie You had me take that
test ‘the Arizona Hunter Education
Course’ or something

ROWTAG
Yeah you didn’t need a license
back then because you were a lot
younger than 14 but you could only
hunt small game

RAMBO
I got a squirrel and you got an Elk
that day

ROWTAG

That was a big day You drew your
first blood and shot your first
with a bow and arrow just like your
ancestors did before you That day
you became a man

RAMBO
(laughing)
I’ve moved a little up the food
chain since then

ROWTAG
You can’t climb too high too soon
son You need to learn the craft
each step of the way Starting off
small and working your way up but
these tests prepare you for the
real world

Rambo smiles

The thought of his father still doing and saying the fatherly
thing after so much time apart

RAMBO
The things you’ve taught me have
saved my life on many occasions
Sometimes the most simple of things
are the best in difficult
situations

ROWTAG
Training you to stay out in the
wild for days living off the land
and hunting to stay alive

RAMBO
(laughing)
Yeah I think my record at the time
was 3 days before I needed to get
back home for some real food

ROWTAG
Hotdogs and brownies isn’t what I
would call real food

RAMBO
I meant something I was more
familiar with at the time I did
have a sweet tooth when I was
younger

ROWTAG
You sure did son Those were good
days I don’t remember much these
days but I still recall those days
so clearly as if they were
yesterday

RAMBO
(turning serious)
For most of my life though I’ve
been playing that same game but it
wasn’t just a game anymore it was
real and I became good at it too
Too good

ROWTAG
(chuckling)
Well If you had sucked at it
maybe you would have come back much
sooner than you did

RAMBO
(looking away)

Being locked up in Vietnam had
really changed me back then The
human body is capable of taking so
much punishment but it’s the mind
that is the weakest part I became
accustomed to turning my mind off
and just becoming an empty shell I
had no emotions no feeling or
guilt because that was a weakness
the enemy would exploit

(MORE)

RAMBO (CONTD)
In the end I just played along
until I saw an opportunity arise to

escape and I took it
ROWTAG
(defiant)

You were a POW for 6 months in that
hellhole before you escaped It was
a miracle that you got out

RAMBO
(tearful)
I never really got out of that
nightmare dad Unfortunately
that’s something that will always
be with me

Rambo picks up the old army photo of his old special forces
squad and looks intensely at all the dead faces
CU ON PICTURE OF RAMBO’S SQUAD

RAMBO (CONTD)
That’s why I had to leave

STAY ON Rambo until we

CUT TO

EXT TRAINING CAMP - DAY

A UH-60 helicopter is in the sky making it’s way back to
base

It touches down in a field with men dressed in Special Forces
black jumping out

There is a lot of activity with men drilling training and
field stripping weapons

This looks like a routine army base with barracks and firing
ranges Mess hall Gym latrines courtyard small airstrip
to the side of camp

ANGLE ON

a two level building that is the camp’s main administration
offices

INT OFFICE - DAY

ERIC GALT is in his early forties with prematurely thinning
red hair He is about 5 foot 10 and of stocky muscular build
He is a retired special forces veteran who has become
something of an entrepreneur when he started his own private
contract security firm STILLWATER SECURITY CONTRACTORS (SSC)

Now he has a multi million dollar business with plenty of
under the table contract work for the government to fill his
pockets Especially taking care of the illegal immigration
problems that Arizona has been plagued with

Life has been good for Mr Galt but it’s about to get a lot
better

The PHONE RINGS

GALT
Yeah Galt here

INT BAR - CONTINUOUS

DINER MAN with the green jacket is sitting at the bar with a
beer beside him He is on his cell He still has his green
jacket on but it’s now open to reveal his weapon under his
arm a BERRETA PX4

DINER MAN
It’s Webster

INTERCUT WITH

GALT AND WEBSTER

GALT
What do you want Webster

WEBSTER
How’s your day going so far

GALT
(irritated)
Cut the bullshit Webster Want do
you want

WEBSTER
I have some information for you
that I know you’1ll appreciate
GALT
Finally my no good sister is

divorcing you at long last I told

her you were a bum

WEBSTER
(hurt)
Hey I have feelings Galt but
no that ain’t the news

GALT
Look Webster if you don’t stop

wasting my precious time I’m gonna

send Coburn around to slap some
sense into you

WEBSTER
(triumphant)
John Rambo
GALT
(silence)

WEBSTER
Has that got your attention

CLOSE UP ON GALT

Galt’s expression suddenly changes

CLOSE UP ON GALT’S EYES

They’re wide and thoughtful

EXT FARM HOUSE - EVENING

The farm is peaceful as light slowly fades

INT LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Rambo walks over to a picture of his mother
picks it up

CU PICTURE

Of a beautiful lady in her thirties

CUT TO

on a table and

he

RAMBO
(sadness)
I heard about Mom Sam Trautman
told me the news a while back
(beat)
Sam’s gone too

ROWTAG
Yes Cancer is taking everyone
these days She passed on too
young Sam Trautman was the only
man I felt I could really trust
when it came to the military He
seemed to really care about you son

Rowtag moves uncomfortably in his chair
Envious maybe because Colonel Samuel Trautman ended up being
more of a father figure than he did or maybe the fact he has

a secret himself

Rambo suddenly recognizes the box on the table beside his
mother’s picture

He flips the lid

CU ON BOX
It’s full of medals

FATHER (0S)
Sam came over with those just
before he died

REVERSE BACK TO ROWTAG

FATHER (CONTD)
He told me you tried to flush them
down the toilet when you were
locked up after that incident up in
Oregon He said I should be proud
of you I was

RAMBO

is taken aback with the discovery of his old medal
collection

He picks out the ‘CONGRESSIONAL MEDAL OF HONOR’ and holds it
gently between his fingers

ROWTAG (0S)
Because you tried to flush them all
down the toilet at once they got
jammed up in the pipe

Rambo turns to his father

ROWTAG (CONTD)
I’m not sure how many medals you
had but I’m pretty sure they’re all
there You didn’t even tell me you
had won any

RAMBO
I didn’t feel like I deserved them
It got to the stage that I was
ashamed to show them to anybody
They had only brought me bad
memories Nobody cared anyway

ROWTAG
I care son When Sam Trautman give
me that box and I opened it I
couldn’t believe my eyes My own
son a war hero There isn’t a day
goes by that I don’t go through
that box of medals and think of

you
(beat)
I was so proud of you but I could
never tell you not until today
RAMBO
(disapprovingly)

They’re weren’t any heros in that
war Just survivors who came back
without the respect they deserved
I lost close friends almost
everyday In the end you lose the
very essence that makes you a human
being I was just a machine with no
emotions

ROWTAG
That’s all in the past now I’m
glad you came back son
(smiling)
-even if you did leave ita
little late

Rowtag gets up slowly and looks to be in severe pain but
still manages to walk over to Rambo Rowtag puts his arms
around his son

ROWTAG (CONTD)

Don’t worry there is plenty of
time for this later You must be
tired Why don’t you rest

His father gets up and leads Rambo to another room

INT BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Rambo walks into a spacious bedroom There is an old tube TV
on the dresser The walls are covered with some of Rambo’s
old movie posters of films he loved when he was just a kid
The Searchers with John Wayne The Wild One with Marlon
Brando and Kubrick’s Paths of Glory

More pictures of him as a child dotted around the room The
blankets on the bed are the same old blankets he used as a
child It’s like his old bedroom had been magically
transferred from Bowie to here

RAMBO
(surprised)
WOW Did you do all this for me
Talk about making me feel at home

ROWTAG
Well son we don’t get much
visitors around here anymore
(beat)
I kinda’ had renewed hope that you
might turn up eventually after your
friend came by

RAMBO
I had wanted to come back for Mom’s
funeral but
(looking down)
Well they wouldn’t let me

ROWTAG
I know you were in prison son I
heard all about that thing in
Oregon Read all about it in the
papers at the time Sam told me
what really happened though How
that hick sheriffs dep’t provoked
you

RAMBO
(shaking his head)
No I went looking for it I
could’ve walked away but I didn’t
I was still young and angry
(MORE)

RAMBO (CONTD)
I had just found out that Delmore
was dead I was the last of my
squad

Rambo sits down on the side of his bed and looks his father
in the eye

RAMBO (CONT’D)
(breaking down)

Dad I can’t tell you everything
because I’m scared you wouldn’t be
able to love me again I have done
so many things in my life that I
should be ashamed of but because
of what I have become Im not
ashamed

ROWTAG
(defiant)
You are my son We are cut from the
same stone If anybody can
understand the decisions youve
made then it’s your own father

Rowtag sits with his son and puts an arm around him to
console him They sit in silence for a few moments

Rowtag then moves to the closet and opens the door The
closet is full of cardboard boxes and old clothes hanging on
the rod

ROWTAG (CONTD)
As you can see all your stuff is
still here I don’t know if you
still need any of it but when you
have time you can go through it I
was always too lazy to throw
anything away and I thought maybe
I could use some of it some day but
I never did

RAMBO’S POV
looking at all the boxes in the closet Then looks at his old
clothes along the railing Triggering thoughts of the happier

moments from his past Things he had almost forgotten about
until this moment

CU ON REPLICA COLT 45 PEACEMAKER

he used to play with as a young boy Maybe the seeds were
sowed from those moments playing Cowboys and Indians

He always wanted to be a soldier

FLASHBACK TO

INT RAMBO’S HUT THAILAND - SEVERAL MONTHS EARLIER
Rambo is having a heated conversation with SARAH MILLER

RAMBO
Why did you come back here

SARAH
I thought about what you said and
about your father I felt he
deserves to know that your still
alive

RAMBO
It’s none of your business Sarah
(beat)
Did you talk to him

SARAH
Yes I went to see him and we
spoke It’s not an easy place to
find

(MORE)

SARAH (CONTD)
He moved from Bowie many years ago
Went up north to Holbrook Has an
old farm house outside of town The
local sheriff took me there

RAMBO
But why Sarah

SARAH
I wanted to do it for your father
I wanted to let him know that he
had a son he could be proud of

RAMBO
Proud
(laughing)
If I had any sense at all I
wouldn’t have let you idiots go up
river to Burma

SARAH
That was our decision I regret
what happened We were foolish

RAMBO
(shaking his head)
I can’t believe you went all that
way to track down my father

SARAH
Well you know me I’m always
trying to help somebody in some way
or another I just wanted to speak
to your father and let him know
your safe I saw the relief in his
eyes Rambo

RAMBO
I know where this is going Sarah
but I can’t go back Not after all
this time I’m too ashamed to go
back now

SARAH
Rambo your father is dying He
hasn’t got long and if you don’t go
back now you’ll lose that chance

RAMBO
How do you know this If there is
one thing I do know about my father
it’s that if he is dying he
wouldn’t shout it out for the whole
world to hear He’s a very private
and proud man

SARAH
He didn’t need to tell me I just
know It looks like advanced
Pancreatic Cancer His eyes and
skin are yellow from Jaundice with
constant muscle spasms and chills
his breathing is heavy and labored
and he also has type 2 diabetes I
saw the medication he was taking
He is painfully thin with no
strength and he is all by himself
living in total solitude He really
needs you Rambo

RAMBO
That could mean anything It
doesn’t mean it’s Cancer For
Chrissake Sarah he’s an old man

SARAH
No I’m not 100 But in my line
of work over the years I have seen
these symptoms over and over
Rambo don’t be selfish Please do
it for your father if not for
yourself You didn’t see his face
light up when I told him how you
helped us in Burma He was in
tears

RAMBO
I hope you didn’t tell him
everything He’ll think I’m some
kind of monster

SARAH
He still loves you Rambo Just go
back Please go home

DISSOLVE TO

IE RAMBO’S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY

Rowtag moves into the bedroom slowly and turns off the lamp
by the side of the bed Rambo doesn’t move

He is fast asleep Probably the only time in 30 or so years
that Rambo has felt safe enough to let his guard truly down
and rest peacefully

Rowtag moves out of the room and closes the door silently
All is dark and peaceful

CUT TO

INT ROWTAG’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT DAY

Rowtag is in bed and is awoken by a loud CHOMPING sound
outside

He gets up slowly a little dazed and confused maybe
forgetting briefly that his son is back home again
CU CLOCK

‘630 am’

Rowtag peeks out of the curtains to see what is causing the
noise outside

POV OF WINDOW

as we see Rambo outside CHOPPING WOOD with an AXE

There is a large pile of kinder that’s already been cut
Rambo is wearing a sleeveless T-shirt exposing his toned
muscular torso His arms are pumped with protruding veins

visible as he clenches the handle of the axe tighter and
tighter

EXT RAMBO COTTAGE - MORNING

Rambo’s body clock is trained for early morning starts He is
refreshed after a good nights sleep He feels strong but
still has an urge to keep his body in good physical condition
albeit his advanced years

SERIES OF CUTS OF RAMBO CUTTING WOOD

Rambo’s instincts tell him that someone is coming up behind
him He can tell the person is slow and his stride is short
by the sound of his FOOTSTEPS He can also hear HEAVY
BREATHING

Rambo doesn’t turn around but keeps on CUTTING the wood

RAMBO
(without turning)
You’re up early dad

WIDE SHOT of Rambo cutting wood in the fg In the bg
Rowtag is walking slowly towards him

ROWTAG
I was wondering what all the racket
was

RAMBO

(apologetically turning

towards his father)
Sorry but I’m a early riser

(beat)
I haven’t done this for years Kind
of reminds me of back in prison
when they had me breaking rocks in
the quarry I’m gonna be real sore
tomorrow dad

ROWTAG
(laughing)
Now you know how I feel every
morning

Rowtag watches as Rambo SLICES through the wood logs like
they are made out of butter

ROWTAG (CONTD)
Well if you have so much energy
son I can come up with a few jobs
that need done around this place

RAMBO
Sure

ROWTAG
The barn could do with fixing up
if you don’t mind son

Rambo stops CUTTING and leaves the axe in the stump He looks
around at his father and then at the barn

CU ON THE PADLOCK ON THE BARN’S DOOR

RAMBO
(curious)
I notice that the barn is the only
place you keep locked-up around
here

ROWTAG
I have a good reason for that

RAMBO
(curious)
Well are you going to share it
with me

ROWTAG
Why don’t I just show you
(beckoning Rambo to follow
him with a hand gesture)

EXT BARN - CONTINUOUS

Rowtag turns towards the old barn and Rambo follows after his
father

Rowtag opens the padlock and removes the chain holding both
the doors closed

ROWTAG
Well Would you like to give me a
hand opening these big heavy doors

RAMBO
Sure

IE BARN - CONTINUOUS

Rambo moves in fast before his father could help and pushes
in both the doors open simultaneously

The interior of the barn is dark but after a moment for his
eyes to adjust he sees it

RAMBO
(surprised)
wow

ROWTAG
I thought that would be you’re
response

Sitting in the middle of the barn is a 1972 Harley Davidson
XR750 in sublime condition The paint is black with a fire
motif covering the main chassis

ROWTAG (CONTD)
The best American dirt road racing
bike there was and probably still
is in my opinion

RAMBO
This is still in mint condition
(turning to Rowtag)
Were you scared to ride it

ROWTAG
(exaggerating an insult)
Hey I rode the hell out of that
bike in the day Banged it up
pretty good as well

Rowtag goes over to the bike and caresses it with his hand
stroking it gently in a sign of true affection

ROWTAG (CONTD)
No we had great days But we also
had a few accidents as well In the
end I spent more time fixing her
up than actually riding her

RAMBO
Does she still run

ROWTAG
Damn right she does I take her out
for a spin every so often just to
make sure she’s still running fine
The sheriff in town brings me any
parts I may need from the garage
Specialized parts that you have to
order She’s my pride and joy and I
like to keep her looking pristine
Gave her a new paint job not so
long ago I polish her chrome and
keep her clean every week

RAMBO
(laughing while looking
around)
It must be the only thing you keep
clean around here

ROWTAG
Yeah well I have to balance
what little energy I have these
days with what’s truly important
After your Mom died this was the
only woman left in my life 748 cc
air-cooled v twin engine capable of
up to 115 mph

RAMBO
(smiling)
Is that all

ROWTAG
(insulted)
Hey This bike was good enough for
Evil Knievel Did all of his big
jumps with this bike

RAMBO
Only joking
(beat)
I do like the paint job though I
guess the fire motif is in
reference to your name

ROWTAG
You didn’t forget then
RAMBO
Hey what kind of son do you think
I am
(beat)
Wait a minute Don’t answer that
one

(both laughing)

ROWTAG
Well aren’t you itching for a
ride

RAMBO

Dad this is your pride and joy
You trust me enough to ride your
bike

ROWTAG
(smiling)
What kind of father do you think I
am if I can’t let my own son use
my bike

Smiling at his father Rambo gets on the bike

ROWTAG (CONTD)
Fire her up

Rambo turns the key and starts to REV up the engine
RAMBO
You know the last time I road a
bike was way back in Oregon just
before they locked me up

Rambo kicks the stand up and looks at his father

RAMBO (CONTD)
Need anything in town

ROWTAG
Just make sure you bring the bike
back in one piece

RAMBO
I may be a while so don’t wait

up
Rambo REVS up the engine a few more turns and bursts out of
the barn doing a wheelie
CU ON ROWTAG
ROWTAG
(regretfully)

EXT DIRT ROAD - DAY

Rambo is cruising down the road with his long hair flowing
back in the slipstream and a cloud of dust in his trail

He is smiling

EXT ROUTE 66 - DAY

Turning from the dirt road Rambo connects onto the main 2
lane highway - route 66

It’s ironic that the iconic John Rambo the all American
Patriot is cruising down the historic route 66 on a classic
Harley

The main road goes for a few miles until it get’s into the
city of Holbrook

The city of Holbrook only has a population of just over 5000
people It’s a very open and spread out city with an airport

EXT HOLBROOK - DAY

Rambo turns into the Wigwam motel and looks at all the wigwam
style motel rooms around the car park He cruises around the
car park fascinated by all the old classic cars dotted
around the area After a few moments he turns back onto the
main road and heads further into town

Cruising down the main street of Holbrook he passes the
diner

POV OF RAMBO

as he sees the same green jacket guy sitting in his usual
spot Green jacket turns and looks back at Rambo as he
passes

He continues on down the street
POV OF RAMBO
as he passes Hardwickes GunsRus Superstore

It’s a sick parody of the toy store but for hunters and
weekend soldiers

EXT ROUTE 66 - DAY

After cruising through the town of Holbrook Rambo proceeds
along route 66 for a 24 mile stretch of road He speeds up a
little to shorten the journey

EXT PETRIFIED FOREST ROAD - DAY

Rambo comes to a crossroads and turns right onto the
petrified forest road This is a smaller two lane road with
amazing scenery

The area known as ‘The Petrified Forest’ was once a lush
arable land with trees and vegetation but was destroyed 200
million years ago from volcanic lava The remnants of that
forest can still be seen from the petrified wood that
tourists come to see today

A SERIES OF SHOTS

MONTAGE accompanied by an 80s style ROCK BALLAD Driving past
the 800 year old dwellings of Puerco Pueblo reading the
petroglyph’s on Newspaper Rock riding past the wigwam shaped
rock pillars of the Tee Pees looking over the vast canyons
of the Painted Desert driving through the stunningly strange
and alien landscape of the Blue Mesa sitting by the Agate
bridge watching the tourists standing looking over the
Crystal forest a dead forest where the wood has turned to
quartz

He rides down Petrified road until the road comes to an end
and joins onto highway 180

EXT HIGHWAY 180 - EVENING

It’s been a long but satisfying ride for Rambo Something he
has dreamed of doing for many years

He heads back to Holbrook by taking the 180 It’s about 19
miles back into town Light is fading fast Rambo turns the
throttle and heads home He speeds off into the distance

WIDE SHOT of Highway 180 with Rambo tearing off into the
sunset during magic hour

EXT DARK BLUE SKY - EVENING

There are two modified Sikorsky UH-60 helicopters flying in
the evening sky Black silhouettes against the blue and
orange canopy of dusk They are code-named FIREBIRD 1 and
FIREBIRD 2

IE UH-60 (FIREBIRD 1) - NIGHT

with a big smile on his face as he puts the binoculars down
by his side He has a look of intense thought then his face
lights up He looks over to one of his men opposite him in
the helicopter His name is COBURN and he is Galt’s top right-
hand man and advisor

GALT
(shouting)
Change of plan boys

COBURN
(confused)
What do you mean Sir

Before Coburn could do anything Galt get’s up and grabs
someone to his left

CU ON THE PASSENGER
sitting beside Galt to reveal
Rowtag Rambo

He is bound at the wrists with plastic strapping and gagged
at the mouth He appears to be in some discomfort and
disheveled

EXT DIRT ROAD - CONTINUOUS

We hear the SOUND of HELICOPTERS overhead Rambo looks up
into the sky But it’s too dark and he’s too disoriented to
locate the source of the sound as he rides the bike

IE UH-60 (FIREBIRD 1) - AIRBORNE - CONTINUOUS

Galt grabs Rowtag and drags him to the open side door of the
helicopter He is holding onto the back of Rowtag’s long grey
hair as Rowtag balances precariously on the edge

COBURN
(stunned)
Shit What are you doing Sir What
about the plan

GALT

(shouting to pilot and

pointing)
Bring the helicopter over the road
and stay a few yards in front of
that man on the bike

(turning to Coburn

smiling)
I couldn’t have planned this better
myself

Galt checks his position over Rambo with the night vision
binoculars

GALT (CONTD)
(shouting to pilot)
A little more to the right
That’s it Keep it steady

Galt releases his grip on Rowtag’s hair and pushes him out of
the helicopter to fall to his shocking death

GALT (CONTD)
OOPS

WIDE ARIEL SHOT
of Rowtag falling out of the helicopter

His SCREAMING fades into the darkness

EXT DIRT ROAD - CONTINUOUS

Rambo is stunned when he sees what looks like a body fall
from the sky several yards in front of him

He slams on the brakes hard He loses control and the bike
skids off the road with Rambo following the bike into a ditch
by the side of the road

Galt is looking down with his night vision binoculars
Scanning the area until he see’s Rambo

He laughs

of Rambo getting up slowly from out of the ditch and making
his way to the body lying there in the middle of the road
EXT DIRT ROAD - CONTINUOUS

Rambo is shaken and hurt from the fall One of his arms is
grazed badly up and down from when he instinctively tried to
break his fall from the skidding bike He is covered all over
in dirt and is coughing heavily from sucking up a mouthful of

dust

He approaches the misshapen body which is lying in the
middle of the road all bent and broken from the fall

There is something familiar about the body He gets closer
He put’s his bloody arm out towards the mess of broken bones
that was once a human being and turns it’s head around
RAMBO
(TOTAL SHOCK)
NOOOOOO000000000
He SCREAMS
He is confused and disoriented
Rambo doesn’t know what has just happened He is staring at
the bloody mess that was his father and he just can’t
believe it

It is incomprehensible

With all the horrors Rambo has seen in his lifetime this is
the biggest of them all

He falls to the ground and breaks down in tears He curls
himself up in a fetal position beside his dead father

WIDE SHOT of Rambo in the fg lying with his dead father and
in the bg a helicopter hovers down into the frame with a
jovial Eric Galt hanging out of the open side door of the UH-

There are several men in black assault gear and armed with M4
machine guns

They are in attack position

Galt is looking down at the road watching what seems to be
two lifeless bodies The rotor wash from the helicopter’s
blades is blowing up dust from the road into the air making
visibility harder

Galt grabs a loudspeaker phone and puts it to his lips

EXT DIRT ROAD - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE UP ON RAMBO’S FACE WITH HIS EYES CLENCHED SHUT
Rambo has anguish and pain etched into his tormented face
He hears a VOICE

RAMBO’S EYES COME TO LIFE

GALT (0S) (CONTD)

Rambo rolls off the road into the darkness just as Galt
fires

Several of his BULLETS hit the dirt that was occupied by
Rambo not a second earlier

GALT
(disappointed)
Shit The bastard’s still fast

Galt looks around through the night vision binoculars but
can’t seem to locate Rambo anywhere

Rambo’s vanished into the darkness

COBURN
(cautious)
I don’t like this sir We’re
sitting ducks here

GALT
What is he going to do He hasn’t
got any weapons

Suddenly a LOUD THUD

GALT (CONTD)
(surprised)
What the fuck

Then another LOUD THUD

This time it was a lot closer Galt shaken looks down to see
the falling rock that had just missed his head by inches

GALT (CONTD)
The bastard’s trying to kill me
like he did my father

The irony of it almost makes Galt laugh until the next ROCK
hits Galt on the head and nearly knocks him off balance

Coburn makes a grab for Galt before he has a chance to go
over

Another ROCK cracks into Coburn’s arm this time as he is
pulling Galt away from the open door They both fall
backwards into the body of the helicopter

Don’t fuck with me Throw down the
shovel and lie on the ground with
your hands behind your back NOW

This time Rambo does turn

He looks at Kelly with complete contempt and anger He
eventually throws down the shovel and puts both his hands up

Kelly approaches cautiously He is taking out his cuffs with
one hand and keeping Rambo in his sights with the other

KELLY (CONTD)
OK Mister that’s real good

Edging slowly forward

KELLY (CONT’D)

Now turn around and lie on the
ground with both your hands behind
you

Rambo gets down on his knees then slowly lies on his front
over the fresh grave of his father

He senses Kelly almost upon him ready to cuff him Just as
the policeman grabs his hand he swings around quickly taking
Kelly’s arm with him in an arm lock and twisting his body to
overpower him in a lightning move Rambo is now lying on
Kelly’s back with his left arm pulled right back

KELLY (CONTD)
(pain)
AAAAAAAAARRRG

Rambo squeezes his arm even further and Kelly drops the gun
in total agony Rambo grabs the gun and immediately stands
up Kelly turns around groggily and looks up at Rambo
Confused with the predicament he’s now in

RAMBO
Take off your uniform

KELLY
What

RAMBO
(sarcasm)
I don’t say please

Rambo then fires a shot from Kelly’s own gun at his head
missing him by only millimeters

RAMBO (CONTD)
Still waiting

KELLY
OK OK Give me a second

Kelly gets up and starts to undress He foolishly tries to
engage Rambo in a conversation

KELLY (CONTD)
So I guess that was your handy
work down the road there

RAMBO
(irritated)
You speak too much Kelly

Rambo takes a step forward and throws a powerful right hook
to the side of Kelly’s face

CRACK

Kelly goes down like the proverbial ‘sack of potatoes’
Unconscious

Rambo then undresses the deputy himself and puts on the
uniform It’s a little tight but Rambo isn’t concerned

He then drags the unconscious naked body of Kelly out of main
view behind some trees off to the side of the farm

Takes out his knife and slits Kelly’s throat with the skill
of a surgeon Very clean and precise Covers the body with
some leaves and dirt until it’s totally hidden

This is a justified kill to Rambo If he let Kelly live he
would have been found too quickly and they would be on him in
no time He now has a window to find out what he needs to
know

Tightening the belt and holster Rambo picks up his back pack
and makes his way to the Dodge and climbs in

INT DODGE DURANGO

Rambo throws his pack onto the back seat He slides into the

driver’s seat and sees that the key is still in the ignition

Starts the car and makes a 3 point turn in the courtyard

He drives back down the dirt road

EXT DIRT ROAD
Rambo swerves around the wreck of the UH-60

We hear bones SNAP and CRUNCH as the wheels roll over them

EXT ROUTE 66 - DAY

The silver Dodge is racing along the highway towards
Holbrook As he gets closer to town a fire truck an
ambulance and 2 police cars race by in the opposite
direction

EXT HOLBROOK - DAY
The dodge is now filtering through the traffic Rambo
suddenly pulls up on the opposite side of the street of the

diner he was in a few days before

He waits

INT DODGE DURANGO - DAY
The RADIO comes to life

RADIO (VO)
Kelly This is Weaver What’s your
twenty

Rambo doesn’t break radio silence and stares down at the
LITTLE SPEAKER

RADIO (VO)
Kelly where the fuck are you You
know not to leave the scene of a
crime

Rambo turns the volume dial down and looks out of the window
He waits hoping that Weaver doesn’t find the body of Kelly
too soon hoping the mess from last night will keep them
occupied for a few hours

Rambo is intensely looking over the street through the big
windows of the diner It’s almost empty again like the day
before He eyes each of the customers who enter and leave the
premises

DISSOLVE TO

EXT DINER —- LATER
Rambo recognizes the Red pick-up parked further up the road

Webster green jacket and all appears along the street and
makes his way to the diner

He walks through the diner’s doors and sit’s in his usual
seat at the bar

IE DODGE DURANGO - CONTINUOUS

Rambo watches him enter the diner and immediately gets out of
the Dodge

He walks across the busy street without a care of oncoming
traffic Cars are BEEPING him and SCREECHING and SWERVING to
avoid knocking him down Rambo is only focused on his target

INT DINER - CONTINUOUS

Webster hears the BEEPING outside and turns to see what the
commotion is

WEBSTER
(dismayed)
Oh my God

The door BURSTS open and Rambo storms in and immediately goes
for Webster Webster tries to get up from his stool but Rambo
is already on him Rambo grabs him by the neck and pulls him
off the ground and throws him across the floor

Webster then goes for his BERRETA PX4 STORM hand gun Rambo
grabs his arms and twists it back behind him He then pulls
Webster’s gun from it’s holster and presses it under
Webster’s chin Rambo releases the safety

RAMBO

RAMBO
OK Who is he

Rambo puts the brakes on and the car comes to a sudden halt
RAMBO
You ain’t playing smart
EXT - HIGHWAY

Rambo gets out of the Dodge and immediately grabs Webster out
of the back seat and throws him onto the road

RAMBO
Start undressing

WEBSTER
Why

RAMBO

Youre ex-Special Forces I think
they call it ‘Forced Nudity’

He undresses

WEBSTER
(laughing)
If you think I’m gonna crack that
easy your not as good as we all
think you are

Rambo ignores him and picks up his clothes and throws them on
the front passenger seat

INT DODGE DURANGO - LATER

We see Rambo back driving along the highway He looks up at
the Rear view mirror

ANGLE ON MIRROR

Webster is on the back seat He is totally naked Rambo has
cuffed his ankles to his wrists by crisscrossing his arms and
legs He is lying on his back on top of his arms and legs in
a very awkward and painful position

RAMBO
This is what we call a stress
position but I guess you already
know that

CLOSE UP ON WEBSTER’S FACE

WEBSTER
Your gonna fucking die for this

Webster is sweating profusely His face is red and he looks
already in severe pain

RAMBO
It ain’t gonna take long before
your muscles start cramping up

WEBSTER
(spitting)
Fuck you I ain’t telling you shit

Rambo puts on the RADIO and turns the volume up He scans the
local radio stations slowly

Suddenly RAP MUSIC PUMPS out of the back SPEAKERS

WEBSTER (CONT’D)
(annoyed)
Turn that shit off

Rambo turns the volume up to the highest setting The back
speakers are BUZZING

WEBSTER (CONT’D)
(screaming)
Please man Turn that shit off now

This is what we call ‘sensory

The Dodge is cruising down the deserted road Rap music is
booming from the speakers inside the car

Webster is in real pain now He is SCREAMING because of the
prolonged physical discomfort His muscles are cramping up
and he can’t stretch or do anything about it

WEBSTER
(agony)
PLEASE I can’t take this anymore

RAMBO
So who is he

Webster starts to laugh again

WEBSTER
Nice one You almost had me I’m

better than that

RAMBO
(nodding)
OK Webster you win

EXT HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

The dodge pulls up at the side of the deserted road Rambo

gets out and opens the back door and pulls Webster out onto
the dirt He SCREAMS in pain Rambo drags him several yards
along the course dry sand and dumps him to the ground

Rambo then takes the handcuffs off Webster and steps back

RAMBO
Start digging

WEBSTER
(laughing)
You forgot my shovel

RAMBO
I didn’t forget anything Your
Special Forces - improvise

WEBSTER
You want me to dig my own grave
with my bare hands

RAMBO
(mocking)
You see you are a smart guy

WEBSTER
Go fuck yourself

Rambo hits him over the head with the gun Webster screams in
pain

RAMBO
If you don’t I’m gonna make your
death as slow and as painful as I
possibly can

Webster starts to dig with his hands Blood is dripping from
his head into the small hole he’s attempting to dig

Rambo then goes back to the dodge and goes through Webster’s
clothes and finds his wallet
POV OF RAMBO

CLOSE ANGLE ON picture of a nice looking redheaded woman and
of a young girl

Nice family
Webster suddenly looks at Rambo He knows where this is
going

WEBSTER
(panic)
Leave them out of it They haven’t
got anything to do with this

RAMBO
(anger)
Just like my father hasn’t got
anything to do with this

WEBSTER
Your father is safe He was only
taken to lure you into a trap
That’s all I know

RAMBO
Someone threw my father out of a
helicopter last night I guess you
don’t know all the facts

Webster is shocked Galt must have went nuts Suddenly
Webster knows he’s dead either way

WEBSTER
(pleading)
Honest to God Rambo I didn’t know
he was going to kill your father
He’s nuts Crazy

RAMBO
(forceful)
Who is he

WEBSTER
He’s my brother-in-law Eric Galt

RAMBO
Why did he kill my father

WEBSTER
Remember when you shot up that town
up in Oregon What am I saying Of
course you do Eric is the son of
Arthur Galt

RAMBO
(confused)
Arthur Galt I don’t remember
him

WEBSTER
Sure you do He was Teasel’s

attitude problem Died from a fall
from a helicopter in Chapman gorge
Rambo’s eyes look up as if in thought

Rambo then shoots Webster twice in the head before he has a
chance to finish

BANG

Webster’s body slumps to the ground where he was digging
Rambo walks back to the dodge leaving Webster’s body for the
buzzards

INT DODGE DURANGO - CONTINUOUS

In the Dodge there is a police computer Rambo tries to
type Galt’s name in the search section but a message comes

up

‘NO WIRELESS CONNECTION’

He is out of range here in the desert Rambo drives back to
town

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

We see the Silver Dodge speeding down the road into the
distance as Rambo passes the ‘Welcome to Holbrook’ sign
EXT STARBUCKS - LATER

Rambo sees a Starbucks and pulls into the car park beside it
He parks as close as he can to the cafe

INT DODGE DURANGO - CONTINUOUS

He tries the computer again and another message pops up on
the screen

‘WIRELESS SIGNALS DETECTED’

There are several options but the first one is ‘ATTWIFI’
Rambo clicks on it and the Starbucks home page comes up on
the screen Rambo hits the ‘CONNECT’ button on the site He’s
online

Rambo types in the name ERIC GALT The search engine asks for
a location so Rambo types in HOLBROOK No matches

So Rambo changes the location to ARIZONA He gets one hit but
it’s not what he’s looking for E SALT

He thinks a moment then remembers what Webster said about
Eric being the son of Art Galt from Oregon Rambo then
changes the location to Oregon He gets a hit for a ERIC GALT
from Glasgow Oregon

Rambo pulls up his information

TYPED INFORMATION ON SCREEN

now and there won’t be any mercy for him He also knows that
he isn’t going to go down without a fight

EXT STARBUCKS - DAY

Before the police have a chance to fortify their positions
Rambo steps on the GAS and makes a break for it

Instead of going out of the regular exit Rambo drives
towards the closest road parallel to the car park There is
an empty space between 2 parked cars Rambo drives straight
through it SCRAPING the sides of both the cars on either
side drives over the curb and sidewalk then turns onto the
main road

INT DODGE DURANGO - CONTINUOUS
Free for the moment again Rambo puts the pedal to the floor

and starts interweaving between the traffic He looks at the
rearview mirror

There are police cars SCRAMBLING out of the Starbucks car
park and onto the road behind Rambo Their SIRENS are
HOWLING They make chase

EXT HOLBROOK - CONTINUOUS

Car chase pursues as Rambo is one step ahead of the following
police cars He goes through a red light and just misses
oncoming traffic from both sides The 2 following police cars
aren’t so lucky as both of them are hit from side on by other
cars who had the right of way

INT DODGE DURANGO - CONTINUOUS

Rambo looks ahead

POV OF THE WINDSCREEN

as we see another police car come towards Rambo This police
car is going against the flow of the traffic in an attempt to
stop Rambo

EXT HOLBROOK - CONTINUOUS

Rambo manages to quickly divert the Dodge to the other side
of the road over the island in the middle of the road Just
missing the oncoming police car by a few feet

The police car then makes a sudden turn by skidding all over
the road before regaining control Other oncoming cars
SCREECH to a halt as well because of the police cars erratic
driving Some of the oncoming cars aren’t so lucky as they
lose control and go off the road The erratic police car then
joins the chasing pack of police cars who are now flying by
in pursuit of Rambo

INT DODGE DURANGO - CONTINUOUS

Rambo looks back to see the commotion

POV OF MIRROR

as we see a big pile up at the junction but several police
cars are still in hot pursuit

Rambo then brings his gaze down to the windscreen

POV OF WINDSCREEN-

He sees a very large oil tanker on a collision course to
collide with Rambo’s Dodge in a matter of seconds

Rambo puts his foot down again and heads straight for the
tanker in a kamikaze suicidal act of insanity

The driver is shaking his head in disbelief

The tanker tries to swerve out of Rambo’s way but loses
control and jack knifes It goes up onto it’s side flipping
over

The Dodge hits the back end of the tanker as it passes Rambo
loses control also but manages to keep the car on its 4
wheels even though he is spinning around and around in the
middle of the road

The skidding tanker is sliding with its momentum along the
street

Rambo’s dodge manages to come to a halt

Rambo ducks his head down with the blast The power almost
lifting the dodge off the ground

EXT GAS STATION

There is an orange mushroom cloud of smoke and fire expanding
into atmosphere

There are police cars that are still trying to catch up with
their assailant getting caught up in the blast radius The
explosion enveloping over another 2 police cars totally
incinerating them

2 more police cars manage to swerve off the road in time not
to take the full brunt of the devastation

EXT POLICE CAR- OFF ROAD

We see one of the police cars stopped by the side of the

INT DODGE DURANGO

Rambo is looking back at the destruction he has just caused
The explosion and the pile up worked good for a distraction
He has a moment or two to create some distance between
himself and the cops

EXT DODGE DURANGO - CONTINUOUS

We see the Dodge drive off down the road while all hell is
breaking loose behind it

EX HIGHWAY

EXT HOLBROOK - MOMENTS LATER

We see another couple of police cars make there way around
the carnage to make chase with Rambo

Rambo takes the turn off from the main highway onto the dirt
road leading to his fathers farm

Police cars are in hot pursuit after Rambo even though Rambo
is too far ahead of them by now

They have lost sight of him

EXT DIRT ROAD

The silver Dodge stops abruptly halfway up the dirt road
half blocked by the wreck of the helicopter

Rambo gets out with his back-pack in his grasp He pauses a
moment and looks back at his father’s blood stain on the
road

RAMBO’S POV

Sees the blood stained ground that broke his fathers fall

He shakes himself out of it

Rambo jumps down into the ditch out of sight

EXT HIGHWAY -

The 2 police cars get to the junction They both stop One of
them drives off following the main highway the other goes up
the dirt road

IE POLICE CAR - MOMENTS LATER
The police car is coming up towards the silver Dodge It
stops a few yards behind it and ONE of the TWO TROOPERS gets

out real slow and cautious

TROOPER 1
Stay here and call this in

Where the fuck did he go

TROOPER 1
I can’t see anyone in the dodge

TROOPER 2 (0OS)

the Rambo farm over

EXT DIRT ROAD - DAY

The trooper is making his way slowly to the dodge The
driver’s door is left open He looks in expecting the worst
but sees nothing

There is nobody there

Rambo is gone

The sound of a MOTOR BIKE’S ENGINE suddenly breaks the
silence

It is coming from down in the ditch behind the other side of
the road The abrupt intrusion of the SOUND makes the trooper
almost jump out of his uniform

POV OF TROOPER

as he sees Rambo flying out of the ditch just like Evil
Knievel on his bike The bike goes up a few feet in the air
and lands on it’s back wheel He is about 10 yards up ahead
of the stunned trooper

The trooper starts to shoot at the departing Rambo but can’t
hit him as he is zig-zagging away from him across open
terrain

Rambo is getting further and further away

The other trooper in the police car sees Rambo getting away
and tries to follow by instinctively turning the car in
Rambo’s direction to make pursuit

TROOPER 1
(calling out)
NO What are you doing

But it’s too late as the other trooper can’t see the ditch
and the police car plummets head first into it

EXT ARIZONA DESERT - CONTINUOUS

We see Rambo looking back at the police His back tire
kicking up a trail of dust in his wake

He is now heading out into the desert
Away from civilization

DISSOLVE TO

EXT DESERT - NIGHT

Rambo is sitting in a crop of large rocks This will be his
shelter for a few hours He purposely doesn’t light a fire
because he will give away his position but there is plenty
of moonlight He knows the authorities would be fools to
follow him out into open territory

He hears more HELICOPTERS up in the sky but they are too far
off Maybe the police finally got their chopper out of the
shop after all

Rambo opens his sack and pulls out a protein bar He needs to
keep his strength up He doesn’t plan to stay out here for
too long

He also pulls out some sterilized wipes and anti-bacterial
cream from his back-pack He first wipes the dirt from his
grazed arm and then rubs in some of the cream afterwards It
stings like hell but Rambo doesn’t even notice

Rambo is sitting looking ahead in contemplation So much has
happened in the last 24 hours His whole life has been turned
upside down

When will it ever end

This personal war

It’s his turn now to make his move It will be an all out
offense Time to settle the score once and for all He has

nothing to live for anymore except revenge

down and you went and blew it

COBURN

disbelief)
We had a plan That plan ceased to
exist when you threw his father out

(smiling to himself)
But you have to love the irony of
it He was responsible for my
father falling to his death from a
helicopter so I do the same to
his

Poetic justice I just couldn’t
help myself

Galt takes a drink while chuckling away almost JR like
from ‘Dallas’ in his mannerisms

He turns back to the window

I’ve been listening into the police
chatter Rambo’s been a busy man

GALT

He’s killed several police men
then he blew up a oil tanker and a

Directing Coburn’s attention to the commotion outside his

Why would you think he’1ll risk
going back to town

It’s the early hours of the morning

SERIES OF SHOTS OF THE TOWN AT NIGHT

So peaceful and calm Empty dark streets Empty car parks
Traffic lights changing for the ghosts A light breeze
blowing a candy wrapper across the street

Suddenly movement

A dark figure shoots across the street Disappears into the
darkness Moves again across another street This time we see
the dark figure hugging the wall

CLOSE UP ON THE FIGURE’S FACE

It’s Rambo

He looks over at his objective

RAMBO’S POV

is looking across at the Gun store Hardwickes GunsRus
superstore It is dark and peaceful Then he looks up at the
roof Scanning the area It’s flat and there could be a way
in

He makes his move

EXT GUNSRUS SUPERSTORE - NIGHT

Rambo runs across the street He zig-zags from each cover of

darkness hiding in the shadows Makes his way to the rear of
the building Finds a fire escape and climbs it to the roof

He quickly scans the roof for any sign of entry

There are 3 square skylights across the middle of the roof
He runs to each of them and checks to see if they’re locked
All three of them are He knew it wouldn’t be that easy He
doesn’t want to break in and set off the alarm He’1ll have
the whole of law enforcement upon him

Then his eye catches a large silver metal pipe sticking out
of the roof Similar to what you see on the deck of a ship

He runs over to it

Rambo figures it must be something to do with the air
conditioning The entry is wide enough for him to crawl down
INT UH-60 HELICOPTER - NIGHT

SOUNDS OF THE PROPELLERS and the HUM OF THE ENGINES make up
the background noise

CLOSE UP ON A TV MONITOR - BLACK AND WHITE IMAGE

We see a dark figure on the roof of a building He is
climbing on top of a large pipe He lowers himself down the
shaft feet first and disappears from view

WIDE SHOT

of Galt and Coburn at some sort of surveillance center within

the helicopter There are multiple screens showing different
locations from different angles

CAMERA PANS AROUND

behind Galt and Coburn there are several men in Special
Forces gear They are all armed and ready for action

REVERSE ON GALT AND COBURN

GALT
(concerned)
Just like you said Coburn

COBURN
(shrugs )
I shop there myself

GALT
Yeah but we could be too late

COBURN
I think the fact that Rambo now has
more weapons and ammo at his
disposal than half of Arizona Law
Enforcement could be more of a
concern

GALT
OK we’ll let him leave and get him
when he’s at his most vulnerable

COBURN
Well we do have eyes all over the
town The last thing we need is

Rambo fortifying his position at a

SOUNDS OF SHUFFLING AND BANGING

as Rambo is making his way down the vertical shaft to the
bottom

Then a orange light illuminates from the lighter Rambo has
just flicked on The shaft is silver inside and just wide

enough for Rambo to turn his body He is at a junction He
could go forward or back

Rambo starts banging the bottom of the shaft with his fist
checking it’s density He figures it’s made of thin
aluminum

He takes out his knife from the holster on the bottom of his
leg and jabs hard at the shaft under him The knife goes
through the shaft easy Rambo now starts ripping a large gash
in the shaft with the serrated edge of his knife He jabs and
cuts to form a T-shape Then after a few moments of work
Rambo bends outwards the sides of the gash

Now he is staring down a large black triangular hole below
him

Rambo shines the lighter through the gash

ARIEL POV OF RAMBO

We see a simmering circle of orange light moving around the
darkness below All we see are boxes and more boxes as Rambo
moves his arm around

Rambo gets himself into position and jumps about 5 feet down
onto the top of the boxes directly below him The boxes
contents are soft and the boxes collapse under him breaking
his fall

around He looks up and sees the signs for the different
departments overhead

Rambo is running down the aisles

SERIES OF SHOTS

As Rambo grabs a large shopping cart He is pulling stuff off
shelves into the cart Running to the next aisle Grabbing a
couple of high powered crossbows and some arrows Pushes cart
around the corner of another aisle Sees a Ballistic vest and
grabs one Stun and smoke Grenades are swept into the cart
with his arm Takes a blackjack (or slungshot) baton Hits a
few shelves with it to see if it has any use to him He
throws it in the cart

POV OF RAMBO
looking up to the firearms department

He sees a long glass counter all along the back wall He goes
over to the counter while pushing the cart It is full of
semi automatic hand guns

On the back wall behind the counter there is a large poster
of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover from one of the lethal Weapon
movies

There is a promotion on It reads

“BUY ANY BERRETA 9 MILLIMETER THIS WEEKEND AND GET THE LETHAL
WEAPON BOX SET ON DVD FOR FREE”

RAMBO
(bemused)
Man this is so nineteen
eighties

Rambo smashes the glass counter with the baton and grabs a
couple of the Berretas Throws them in with all the other
stuff in the cart

Below the glass displays are large drawers Rambo tries to
pull one and sees that it’s locked He gets his knife and
forces the lock open Pulls the drawer open and sees what he
was expecting to see ammo

INT SMALL CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
We see TWO MEN in security uniforms sitting behind a desk

drinking coffee They are surrounded by monitors and fancy
computer hardware

Suddenly a loud ALARM goes off and one of the monitors starts
BEEPING

ANGLE ON MONITOR

as it shows a layout of the town but there is a flashing
beep at one specific location

One of the men almost spills his coffee all over himself when
the alarm suddenly startles him Probably used to too many
quiet nights on the job He regains some composure

GUARD 1
Shit It’s the gun store Someone
thinks its 24 hour self service

GUARD 2
Call law enforcement now I have a

hunch it’s the same guy that blew
up half the town yesterday

INT STORE - CONTINUOUS

Unaware the he had just triggered a silent alarm by opening
the drawer Rambo takes some of the ammo boxes out of the
drawer and throws them in his cart

Rambo then takes one of the boxes and opens it Takes out the
magazine clip from one of the Berreta’s and starts filling it
up with bullets Slams the mag shut and puts the gun in the

waste of his pants

He then gets the ballistic vest from out of his trolley and
slips it on Rambo fastens the vest shut

He gets ready to move on but pauses
RAMBO
(nodding)
Now that’s more like it
ANGLE ON CART
as we see a book land on top of the contents

CLOSE UP OF BOOK It’s the novelization of “The Expendables”

Rambo moves on

EXT NIGHT SKY

The 2 UH-60 helicopters are silhouetted against the bright
moonlight

They are skimming across the desert

INT UH-60 HELICOPTER

Galt and Coburn look pensive They are both looking at their
watches Everyone is battle ready and silent within the noisy
interior of the helicopter

Coburn has a headset on and is listening to the police
chatter

COBURN
(shouting over the noise)
Shit

GALT
(seeing his concern)
What is it

COBURN
Rambo must have triggered one of
the silent alarms The authorities
are already moving in

GALT
Those fucking idiots will surround
the place and pin him in They
don’t know what there dealing with

COBURN
Jesus the last thing anybody
wants is to back Rambo into a
corner with an endless arsenal in
his grasp

EXT GUNS’R’US SUPERSTORE - CONTINUOUS

The silence of the night is broken as several police cars are
SCREAMING to a halt outside in the store’s car park SIRENS
are HOWLING in the distance as more police cars make their
way to the store

INT STORE - CONTINUOUS

Rambo hears the CARS SCREECHING outside and goes to the
window to have a look

RAMBO’S POV

sees about 6 police cars outside parked parallel to the
building The law enforcement officers are shielded behind
their cars with their weapons out

EXT CARPARK - NIGHT

CLOSE ON one of the troopers behind one of the police cars
His name is PETERSON He looks concerned and agitated

He turns to speak to the officer next to him TALBOTT
PETERSON

If this is the same guy as before
then we need to call the sheriff

TALBOTT
I ain’t calling him No way man
PETERSON
(contemplating)
Shit I know what you mean
(beat)
Maybe we can deal with this fucker
ourselves
TALBOTT

Id rather deal with this bastard
than have the sheriff on my ass

PETERSON
Yeah I don’t know which one is
worse I wish the bastard would
just retire

They both start a nervous laugh hoping to ease some of the
tension

INT STORE - CONTINUOUS

Rambo grabs the trolley and starts to make his way back to
the other side of the store Running through the dimly lit
aisles as fast as he can He goes through the double doors of
the back storeroom

INT STOREROOM - NIGHT

Rambo sees a window in the middle of the door of the main
rear entrance He runs to it and looks outside

POV OF RAMBO THROUGH SMALL SQUARE WINDOW

as he looks out to see 3 more police cars standing guard with
trigger happy cops popping up behind them

EXT REAR ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

A cop called LENNON spots Rambo’s face for a second
glancing out of the small rear door window

LENNON
(shouting)
I see him

He immediately opens fire at the small window

The rest of the police troopers follow the first guys lead
and also start firing at the metal door

Suddenly it’s a free-for-all as everybody is going gun
crazy shooting wildly

INT STOREROOM

Rambo ducks down for cover as bullets WHIZ over his head

After a minute or so of a constant bombardment of noise the
firing stops It seems too peaceful again

Rambo sticks his hand into the trolley and pulls out a couple
of stun grenades

EXT REAR ENTRANCE

ANGLE ON DOOR

as two objects that look like grenades come flying out of the
hole in the door that was once a window

LENNON
Shit Grenade Get down

Lennon HOOPER and ALL THE COPS throw themselves down behind
their vehicles hoping the blast won’t reach them

The stun grenades go off
POW

POW

No big explosion An anti-climax

The cops all get up slowly and see that it’s only smoke
filling the atmosphere

LENNON (CONTD)
(relief)
It was only a smoker

HOOPER
He was only fucking with us

While the cops were ducking for cover Rambo had opened the
rear door and got out under the cover of the smoke from the
grenades

Suddenly a VOICE coming from the cloud of smoke

RAMBO (0OS)
Here catch

An object comes flying out of the cloud of smoke
simultaneously as the words are said and lands in the arms
of Hooper

He instinctively catches it

It’s a Grenade

A real one

RAMBO (0S) (CONTD)
Now I’m fucking with you

BOOM

Rambo then throws another two grenades to finish the job as
he ducks for cover back into the doorway of the building

The other cops instinctively start to fire in the direction
of the sound of Rambo’s voice because visibility is still
bad

BOOM BOOM

Rambo takes out the rest of the cops as well as 2 police
cars The cars EXPLODE A large orange ball of fire suddenly
erupts up into the atmosphere

EXT CARPARK(FRONT OF STORE) - CONTINUOUS

POV OF TALBOTT AND PETERSON

as we see a large orange cloud of flame light up the darkness
on the other side of the building

TALBOTT
(in shock)
Jesus H Christ he’s doing it
again

PETERSON
I guess it is time to call the
sheriff

TALBOTT
(into radio receiver)
Lennon Come in over
(beat)
Hooper Anybody

He throws the receiver down in frustration

TALBOTT (CONTD)
Shit We need to find out what
happened back there

PETERSON
OK take 3 squad cars around to the
rear of the building and don’t
break radio contact

EXT REAR ENTRANCE

Rambo let’s the flames clear a little and makes his way back
out of the building Has a look around to see if his path is
clear

Then he goes back inside and comes out with his trolley of
weapons He makes his way to the other police car that he
didn’t blow up

Goes to the driver’s side and pulls out the keys Makes his
way around to the back of the car and opens the trunk

Rambo starts to load up his equipment into the back of the
police car This is his getaway vehicle

In the fg Rambo is loading up the boot of the car but in
the bg a UH-60 helicopter hovers down into frame

Rambo is taken by complete surprise as bullets rain down on
him He gets hit with one in the shoulder The ballistic vest
does it’s job stopping the bullet but not without some
severe bruising Rambo is almost knocked off his feet with
the bullet’s impact

IE UH-60 - CONTINUOUS
Galt and Coburn are firing down on their target
COBURN
This is our chance We have to take
him down now
GALT
I know but I want to make him
suffer a little first
EXT POLICE CAR
Rambo rolls under the car for cover He knows he has to move
quickly or he’ll be toast He looks around for some
inspiration
IE UH-60
Galt throws down his M4
GALT
Give me the grenade launcher
EXT REAR ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS
We hear the sound of SIRENS WAILING Everyone looks to their
left and sees 3 police cars coming towards them
INT POLICE CAR
TALBOTT
(to radio)
Peterson it’s Galt and his crew I
think he’s starting World War 3
back here

EXT REAR ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

In seconds they SCREECH to a halt in front of the remaining
police car that Rambo was going to use as a getaway vehicle

Now the newly arrived police cars are between Galt and Rambo

IE UH-60

Galt has the Grenade launcher aimed at the car Knowing
Rambo is injured underneath it

Unfortunately he now has 3 police cars between him and his
target

GALT
Jesus I fucking had him

EXT POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS

Rambo uses this distraction to his advantage He gets ready
to make his move

IE POLICE CAR

Talbott can’t believe his eyes He has just driven into a
War Zone He sees Galt hanging out of a helicopter with a
grenade launcher in firing position He has to be stopped

TALBOTT
(to radio)
Shit he’s aiming a rocket launcher
in our direction

PETERSON (VO)
(shouting with concern)
Don’t get in his way he’s crazy

Talbott throws down the radio handset
He opens his door to get out of his car Suddenly without
warning he is pulled out with great force with a thick
muscular arm around his neck He is lifted off the ground
with the force and swiftness of a well practised maneuver

Rambo has him in a sleeper hold He also has his knife
pressed tightly to Talbott’s throat

Rambo uses Talbott as a human shield as he moves slowly back
towards the rear entrance of the building

IE UH-60

Galt smiles

COBURN
Don’t do it Galt

GALT
(shrugs )
Collateral damage Coburn I’m gonna
take the son of a bitch down even
if it means taking a few cops in
the process
Coburn knows that look in Galt’s face
He makes a move for the grenade launcher
It’s too late

POOMF

EXT REAR ENTRANCE

Rambo has only a split second to react He throws down his
captive as he dives for the rear entrance

The grenade shell hits the car

BOOM

The grenade takes the car up into the air a few feet with the
force and power of the explosion An orange cloud of
devastation fanning out almost instantly smothering
Talbott’s body Toast

Rambo only just makes it out of the range of the explosive
flames The edge of the cloud of fire touching Rambo’s back

and setting his vest on fire

Rambo rolls into the doorway of the building

IE UH-60 - CONTINUOUS

Galt fires another grenade at the doorway just as Rambo
disappears inside

GALT
Die you son of a bitch
INT STOREROOM

Rambo has only just made it inside the storeroom He breaths
a sigh of relief Then

BOOM

The whole doorway and rear wall comes CRASHING in with a
devastating BLAST

Rambo runs and dives quickly away from the flying rubble

EXT REAR ENTRANCE

The whole rear of the building is now a pile of rubble It
looks like an avalanche of concrete and brick has just
settled The dust from the explosion still lingering in the
air making visibility bad

IE UH-60

Galt can’t see anything but dust in front of him

COBURN
You must have got him surely

GALT

Until they drag his crushed body
out I’m leaving nothing to chance

EXT REAR ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

The remaining cops from the following two cars get out of
their vehicles and turn their weapons towards Galt’s
helicopter in self defense unaware that the 2nd uh-60 is
lowering down behind them

IE UH-60(FIREBIRD 1)

Before the cops can open fire Galt starts firing at the last
witnesses of his crime

They return fire
GALT

(talking to headset)
Firebird 3 take them down

EXT REAR ENTRANCE

WIDE SHOT OF BOTH HELICOPTERS FIRING AT THE HELPLESS COPS
CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE

They are sitting ducks caught in the cross fire of more
powerful fire power and expertly trained marksmen

In a matter of seconds they have been vanquished

EXT CARPARK - CONTINUOUS

We see Peterson with the radio handset in his hand He looks
like he’s in shock as he hears the carnage in the distance

PETERSON
(to radio)
Talbott come in Anybody
(starting to lose it)
What the fucking hell is happening
back there

There is nothing from the other side only static

He looks down as if contemplating his next move then puts
the receiver to his mouth

PETERSON (CONTD)
(into radio)
Wake up the sheriff
INT STOREROOM - CONTINUOUS

Rambo is lying in a pile of rubble and dirt slightly dazed
from being hit in all directions from flying concrete bricks

He shakes off the dust and dirt and gets up
Rambo looks back at the devastation behind him and sees that
the explosion has enclosed off the whole rear of the

building

A lucky break in some ways If anybody is coming in from the
rear they’1l have to clear a path first

Rambo then makes for the main store

INT STORE

Rambo bursts through the double doors that lead to the back
storeroom

He is looking up watching the signs overhead of the different
departments as he runs through the aisles

He comes to a display in the ‘Sniper Rifle department’ There
is a mannequin lying down on his front in a sniper position
It is fully clothed in a typical camouflaged US Army uniform

His arms are holding a Chey Tac Intervention M200 Sniper
rifle

This is a large weapon that looks like a black avenging angel
albeit for the red tip on the end of it’s muzzle The M200
has accuracy power and range on a world class level

Rambo grabs it away from the mannequin’s grasp and also grabs
the box of 408 Supersonic rounds made specifically for this
rifle

He makes for the stairs

EXT CARPARK - MOMENTS LATER

We see Galt’s helicopter landing in the carpark of the
GunsRus store Peterson and his force are shielding
themselves with their arms from the rotor wash from the
propeller blades

Galt and Coburn jump out and make their way towards the
police cars

GALT
(shouting)
Who’s in charge here
PETERSON
I am that is until the sheriff
arrives
GALT

Well you’ve been relieved of your
command son I’m taking over the
show from now on

PETERSON
(starts to laugh)
Youve got no jurisdiction in these
matters We’re the law Galt not
you

GALT
And how many men have died under
your command tonight

PETERSON
I’m not sure what happened back
there For all I know

GALT
(cutting him off)
I do
(MORE)

GALT (CONTD)
(beat)
That bastard Rambo took them all
out

He gives Coburn a sly look Coburn keeps his mouth shut

GALT (CONTD)
But I think we may have got him in
the end

PETERSON
You think you got him I take it
you didn’t see his dead body then

GALT
I don’t have time to move a ton of
rubble just to prove to you he’s
dead son The guys a dinosaur

VOICE (0S)
(a commanding voice
interrupts the
conversation)
More like a T-Rex and the only
ones who’ll be extinct by the end
of the night will be you guys

Everybody turns to the direction of the VOICE

PETERSON GALT
(relief) (disappointment )
Sheriff Teasle

WILL TEASLE the former sheriff of the small Oregon town that
Rambo almost single-handedly destroyed 30 years before is
standing there in the darkness

He moves forward into the light He has aged but is still a
very imposing figure

TEASLE

(shaking his head

smiling)
I’ve been enjoying the show the
last few days Watching your goon
squad make a pigs dinner out of
killing one man I should know I
fell into the same trap 30 years
ago

GALT
Will this ain’t your concern
You know what he did to my father

TEASLE
Damn right I do This is as
personal to me as it is to you
Eric Art was more than just a
friend He was part of the family
that’s why I took you in and
adopted you when your mother passed
on

GALT
Adopt me You sent me off to join
the marines the first chance you
had

TEASLE

Yeah well it seemed like the
appropriate thing to do at the
time Every time I looked at you
reminded me of him

(pointing a finger in

Rambo’s direction)
I couldn’t live with the shame
That’s why I moved down here Far
enough from the scene of the crime
and all the whispering behind my
back but close enough to Rambo’s
father just incase he did show up
I’ve been waiting 30 years for some
payback

GALT
Your too late Will He’s lying
under a ton of rubble as we speak
I got to him first I win

TEASLE

(laughing at Galt)
You win This game is long
from over

(Beat)
OK if he is dead why don’t you
take the Wild Bunch back to base
and let the authorities clean up
this mess

GALT
I ain’t leaving until I see his
body

TEASLE
Well I guess we’re all stay

Suddenly without any warning the top half of Coburn’s head
EXPLODES

Blood is spraying everywhere like a sprinkler gone nuts
Coburn’s lifeless corpse drops to the ground

Everybody ducks down for cover
Peterson is next to go
He takes 3 rounds in the chest before his body hits the deck

Everyone is scrambling for cover either behind a police car
or the helicopter

Another cop gets his back blown out just as he was turning to
dive for cover behind his squad car

Finally all the targets are safe They think

TEASLE (CONTD)
(Sarcasm)
What was that you were saying Eric
I feel the game has changed a
little Coburn was a good man

GALT
(looking down lost in
thought )
Coburn I can’t fucking believe it
He was a good soldier

TEASLE
He was nothing but target practice
for Rambo

Teasle notices one of his deputies HARKNESS peering through
the side window of his car door

TEASLE (CONTD)
(shouting to Harkness)
Get your fucking head down

EXT ROOFTOP

Rambo has taken up an elevated position on the roof He has
the sniper rifle set up and aimed down at the police cars

POV OF SIM-RAD 203 NIGHT VISION SCOPE
as it pans from left to right looking for a target We see a
head shape through the police car side on through both

windows

We hear an almost silent MUFFLED BUHTHUMP as the bullet
leaves the silenced chamber Then

SMASH as both windows shatter simultaneously

EXT CARPARK - SAME TIME

Harkness who is peeking through the window of his squad car
literally loses the top of his head His head looks like an
open boiled egg with blood instead of yoke pouring out around
the top

Everybody watches his body drop to the ground They are all
stunned even terrified You can see it in all of their eyes

TEASLE
Fucking do something Galt This is
your party

Galt shouts into his headset

GALT

The helicopter rises into the air above the gun store It
swoops down to make a pass over the rooftops looking for any
sign of movement

EXT ROOFTOP

Rambo hears the sound of PROPELLERS getting closer He looks
up to see a helicopter coming his way quickly He is out in

the open and will be easily spotted

He immediately moves from his position leaving the sniper
rifle behind him

Running back as fast as he can towards the aluminum AC vent
he had used earlier to break into the store
IE UH-60 (FIREBIRD 3)

STUBBS is manning the M-60 machine gun fixed onto a rotating

bullets behind him POPPING off the roof’s surface getting

closer and closer almost clipping his heels clean off

He gets to the vent pipe and dives straight in head first

Annoni pushes himself to the edge of the opening and fires
down

of Rambo falling head first SCREAMING down towards the
camera

In the bg an orange glow lights up the dark shaft as flames
chase after Rambo on his fast descent

Rambo screams as he plummets down engulfed in flames

INT SUPPLY ROOM UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Rambo falls out of the opening in the shaft he had made
earlier onto the boxes below A cloud of orange flame follows
out of the shaft and expands outwards

Rambo rolls out of the way of the oncoming flames off the
crushed boxes onto the floor He makes a run to the exit and
out to safety at least for the time being

Everybody is still crouched down behind their vehicles

(beat)

You may have him out manned but he
has you out gunned

GALT
Stay the fuck out of this Teasle

TEASLE
I have been staying the fuck out of
this since Rambo arrived back in
town
Galt looks at Teasle

His eyes narrow

TEASLE (CONTD)

Oh Yeah I know all about your
plan Webster isn’t one to keep a
secret I knew the plan went off
the rails when I saw the bodies at
the Rambo farm earlier Then I
heard Webster was abducted from his
usual diner by a some nutcase
Kelly was found with his throat cut
beside the Rambo farm His vehicle
goes missing and is located at
Starbucks A car chase pursues An
oil tanker jack knifes into a
petrol station This nutcase
alludes all my deputies and escapes
town Then he disappears into the
desert on a motorbike It doesn’t
take a genius to figure out who the
nutcase is You think I was gonna
sit this one out after waiting for
so long

(deep sigh)
You know Rambo’s old commander
Trautman gave me some advice which
I was too stupid to heed at the
time I was acting just like you
are now too rash and impatient
You can’t force the issue with a
guy like Rambo You have to pick
your moments

GALT

(losing it)
This is my time Teasle I can taste
it Just stay the fuck out of my
way or you’ll end up like those men
of yours back there

(pointing towards the back

of the building)
Do you hear me

Teasle suddenly senses that something isn’t right

He looks into Galt’s eyes Teasle now knows that Galt is
maybe responsible for the deaths of his young deputies

TEASLE
I’1l let you taste it as much as
you can stomach Then when Rambo’s
done with you and your men Ill be
waiting in the wings when nobody is
looking

Galt climbs in the helicopter and sits down in a chair in
front of about 15 monitors Most of the monitors have WHITE
NOISE but 8 of them have a LIVE FEED being broadcast back to

Galt is now the eyes of the operation
Teasle shows up outside the side door peering inside

Come to enjoy the show
TEASLE

Id rather be in the audience than
actually be part of it

some arrows for it This is a auto loading crossbow which
means you can load it with several arrows in one go and it

will auto load the next arrow once you have fired it

McBride and Annoni split up to cover more ground They make
their way from aisle to aisle and back again but they can’t
seem to pick up Rambo’s body heat

McBride spins around to the direction of the sound

It’s too late as he sees the first arrow for 1 microsecond
before it makes contact with his forehead

The 2nd arrow slices clean through and out the other end
taking half of McBride’s brain and skull with it

Annoni is standing at the cooler He is confused and shocked
to see the cooler box empty

In the bg Rambo appears

He aims his crossbow at Annoni

Releases 2 more arrows almost simultaneously

The two arrows go through Annoni’s right leg He goes down on
his knees grabbing the rim of the cooler box to support
himself and to try to regain his balance

He is incapacitated for the moment

A sitting duck

Rambo discards the crossbow and picks up McBride’s M4

He takes a grenade from his belt and loads it in the barrel
He COCKS the grenade launcher

CLOSE ON ANNONI

as he hears the sound of the GRENADE LAUNCHER COCKING

He quickly tries to turn around grabbing his M4 He cries in
anguish and aims his gun at Rambo

Rambo is like stone No movement

The wounded Annoni is in severe pain with two arrows imbedded
in his right leg He slowly lifts his M4 to aim and then
pulls his trigger

SILENCE

No more rounds left

In a sign of defeat Annoni just slumps back down to the
ground and leans back onto the bullet-ridden cooler

He can’t defeat inevitability

RAMBO

fires the grenade launcher A HIGH PITCH WHISTLE is heard as
the grenade flies through the air and then

---BOOM

Annoni blows up like a balloon full of blood and guts

EXT CARPARK

Galt grabs off his headset and throws it on the ground in a
rage

INT STORE

Rambo is crouching over the body of McBride He has the
headset to his ear Listening to Galt’s conversation He
pulls off the camera attachment and keeps the radio receiver

He runs back into the main store and runs down the aisles

He is looking for something and is glancing up at the
department names above each aisle

Finally he finds what he’s looking for

--CS GAS CANNISTERS

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Teasle is jogging down the street away from the rear of the
store

He passes the burnt out shells of former police cars and the
dead bodies of his young men

He glances across the street and sees McNamara in a covering
position at the corner of a side street to his right

He keeps going
MCNAMARA
(into headset)
Do you see this sir
GALT (VO)
(over radio)
Yeah he’s a crazy ole fool Ignore
him Just keep your eyes and ears
open

MCNAMARA
Copy sir

Teasle turns down a 2nd side street off to his left opposite
from McNamara He sees the bike parked between two big waste
dumpsters

He recognizes it as being ROWTAG’S BIKE

He runs over to it

INT UH-60(FIREBIRD 1)

Galt is watching MONITOR 12 as McNamara is obviously
distracted by what Teasle is up to

CU ON MONITOR 12

Teasle has his hand under the petrol tank for a second then
pulls his hand out

REVERSE BACK ON GALT

Displaying a somewhat puzzled look

GALT
(shaking his head in
disbelief)
What’s the point of tampering with
Rambo’s bike Will He ain’t getting
out of this alive old man

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Teasle doesn’t go back to Galt’s location He heads back to
his black 4 wheel drive pick-up truck

He picks up his handset and speaks into it

Galt suddenly hears CARS moving away outside

He glances outside to see all of Teasle’s squad cars
disappearing from the carpark

GALT (CONTD)
I guess I need to call for
reserves

He gets out of his seat and jumps out of the helicopter

EXT CARPARK

Galt makes his way to the other UH-60 and looks in There are
only 2 men inside The copilot HARTSON and STUBBS who is
manning the 60

GALT

Stepping on the gas now sir
INT STORE
Rambo has been listening in to the chatter He has to get out
of the store quickly Galt is going to level half of the town
just to kill him

He now knows that Galt isn’t in as strong a position as he
once was earlier

He runs down the aisle with a trolley loaded with supplies
and looks out of the front window into the carpark

POV OF WINDOW

The police have all gone All there is outside are two
helicopters

Rambo can only see about 3 men including Galt
This is his moment
He makes himself known at the main window

Giving away his position

EXT CARPARK - CONTINUOUS

Galt suddenly like a dream sees Rambo just staring at him
through the big front window of the store

It’s a surreal moment
GALT
IT’S HIM Stubbs get that 60

going now

Galt and Hartson lift up there weapons and start to FIRE at
Rambo

Stubbs races back to his helicopter to add more cover with
the M-60

INT STORE - SAME TIME

Rambo ducks down behind a couple of rows of metal trolleys or
shopping carts Flattening himself to the ground as the GLASS
SMASHES in towards him Bullets are PINGING off the metal
carts and SPLINTERING the wood paneling behind him He keeps
his head down and listens

EXT CARPARK -— CONTINUOUS

Stubbs is now involved with the M-60 A belt of rounds is
going through the M-60 quickly shells are flying out onto
the carpark

Now it’s another free-for-all with all three men emptying mag

after mag at the large square hole that was once a window A
visual feast of firepower that ultimately is ineffective

INT STORE - CONTINUOUS
Rambo is still lying on the floor with his head under his
arms All he can hear is the distinct sound of 3 guns firing
at him
RAMBO
(to himself)
There’s only 3 left Now it’s my
turn

Rambo grabs some SMOKE GRENADES from his cart and throws them
out of the open window

He waits

EXT CARPARK -— CONTINUOUS
4 grenades are landing just in front of Galt’s helicopters
GALT
(turning)
SHIT
Everybody jumps back

POOMF POOMF POOMF POOMF
INT STORE

Rambo then throws a couple of real grenades out into the
smoke-filled atmosphere outside

EXT CARPARK

The 3 men are oblivious to the real grenades landing in front
of both helicopters as their visibility is bad

STUBBS
He’s trying to escape It’s just a
diversion
Stubbs jumps back into the UH-60 and starts firing the M-60
blindly into the smoke in front of him hoping by some miracle
he’1l hit Rambo

Galt and Hartson though make a run for cover and are behind
the two helicopters when

BOOM BOOM

Two giant explosions send both Galt and Hartson flying
backwards across the carpark

Stubbs unfortunately is disintegrated in the explosion
His M-60 is still firing off a round of bullets because
Stubbs severed arm is still holding down the trigger while
his body is dissolving in the fireball

Rambo has just destroyed the other two helicopters

Stubbs is dust

Galt is down

lifeless

Hartson is moving

He get’s up groggily and stumbles to his feet His world is
spinning around him

Until
Whomp Whomp Whomp

3 arrows hit his chest almost instantly together The
spinning ends and he falls to his death
CRANE OR ARIEL SHOT OF CARPARK

As we see the smoking charred remains of two helicopters and
several bodies scattered all over the place The smoke from

the smoke grenades have almost blown away from the scene of

destruction

A solitary figure is walking out into the carpark

it’s Rambo

EXT CARPARK

Rambo pauses and looks around for Galt He sees his body
further away behind one of the burnt out helicopters

Rambo drops the crossbow and pulls out his knife This is
personal He’ll make it slow and painful if he’s still alive

He walks to Galt’s body

EXT ROOF TOP - SAME TIME

Jackson has just positioned himself on the roof to the left
of the Guns’R’us store

He is looking down at the carnage unfolding below him He
fears that Galt and the rest of the men are all dead

Suddenly he sees Rambo walking out into the carpark He is
making his way to Galt’s body

He FIRES down just in front of Rambo stopping Rambo in his
tracks

EXT CARPARK -— CONTINUOUS

Rambo is halted by fire to his right Suddenly there is fire
from his left as well RAINING down on him He is caught in a

crossfire

Rambo turns to move back

EXT WATER TOWER - SAME TIME

Grant is firing down from his position high up on a water
tower’s gantry to the building’s left

GRANT
Oh no you don’t

Grant fears that Rambo is intent to make sure Galt is dead
Rambo must not reach that body at any cost

EXT CARPARK - SAME TIME
Rambo has to now backtrack quickly

He glances back at the body of Galt a few yards behind him
Even if he did make it to the body he would be cut down in
seconds and he wouldn’t even have a chance to finish him if
he was still alive

He keeps moving making it hard for the snipers to get a fixed
target of him He runs back into the store and the safety of
some cover from the bullets raining down in his trail

INT STORE

Rambo runs back inside the store He runs from aisle to
aisle He knows what he’s looking for He finally finds it a
Barett M82 50 Caliber sniper rifle

There is a sign that says sale 500 off the retail price
which is only 9000 He grabs one off the rack with a
WANPVS-10 daynight optic sight already attached to it and
grabs a box of Raufoss MK 211 rounds These are specially
designed exploding rounds for this 50 Caliber rifle

Rambo runs for the stairs with the ‘Light fifty’ as it’s
called in one hand and the box of shells in the other

INT STAIRWELL

We see Rambo is running furiously up several flights of
stairs

INT UPSTAIRS STOREROOM

Rambo goes into the storeroom he had so narrowly escaped from
earlier The explosion had knocked out most of the ceiling
above The AC shaft has detached itself from the ceiling and
is now hanging down diagonally at one side

There is a large opening that is visible above Rambo that
opens the room to the elements outside We can see the dark
sky with the moon shining down through the gap Water is
starting to DRIP down through the opening We hear THUNDER
outside and the RAIN pelting against the roof

Rambo climbs up into the large opening above He makes sure
he is covered by the structure and not open for an easy
target

Rambo roughly knows the locations of each of the snipers from
the trajectory of the shots that were coming down on him in
the car park He needs to take out the sniper high in the
building to the left first

Rambo finds a nicely concealed nook to set up his M82 just
inside the roof’s structure He is sheltered there from the
rain but he is still able to see out to the opposite building
through the gap in the blown up concrete rubble and twisted
metal support beams that was once holding the roof together

Rambo pulls out a small mirror and looks at his reflection

EXT BUILDING ROOF TOP

POV OF NIGHT VISION OPTICAL SIGHT

As Jackson is looking down the front of the store Then he
switches his view to the roof and specifically the large hole
where the roof had caved in from the explosion earlier

REVERSE BACK TO JACKSON

EXT MD
ANGLE ON ARIEL BOMB

WIDE

as the helicopter races towards the distant lights of
Holbrook

EXT BUILDING ROOF TOP

Jackson is looking down at the roof from his position and

suddenly sees what looks like something shining in the
opening

It could be a light or something reflecting the light from
the full moon

POV OF NIGHT SCOPE

The view from the scope pans from left to right until it
finds the location of the SHINE It’s hard to find at first
because of the visibility gradually getting worse the harder
the rain falls It’s moving or shaking as if someone is
moving a mirror into the light Then it suddenly disappears

as if it was just dropped

Jackson has an uneasy feeling in the pit of his stomach He
slowly moves his view to the other side of the opening

POV OF JACKSON’S SCOPE

as we see Rambo fire off a shot straight at him from his M82
He doesn’t have time to pull the trigger as the bullet
smashes into his optical sight and through his head
Jacksons head is taken clean off with the power of the 50

Caliber bullet

Jackson’s corpse slumps down decapitated

EXT ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

We see Rambo picking up the small mirror he had used to
distract Jackson

ANGLE ON MIRROR

POV OF BINOCULARS

We see the slumped body of Jackson hanging over the edge of
the top of the building

He has no head

REVERSE BACK TO GRANT
He puts the binoculars down slowly His jaw is wide in shock

Mac Rambo’s taken Jackson out man
Took his fucking head clean off

Shit You need to cover the roof
and front of the building from your

Shit man I can’t stay up here I

feel like a sitting duck I’m too

easy to spot
Suddenly Grant gets hit hard in the side of his chest
His body is spliced in two with the 50 Caliber bullet
The top half of his body is flying back breaking through the
wooden support barrier and off the side of the water tower

Meanwhile the lower half slumps to the gantry floor on top
of the tower

EXT ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS
Rambo pulls himself out of the opening and quickly makes his
way to the back of the store’s roof

hears STATIC over his radio

The rain is pouring down on him He has the headset to his
ear

(to himself while
listening to McNamara)
Almost everyone

EXT REAR ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS
McNamara looks up towards the roof of the Guns’R’us store
MAC’s POV

Rambo is aiming his M82 down from the edge of the roof
straight at him

REVERSE BACK TO MCNAMARA
As his jaw drops for that second that lasts an eternity

It’s the last second of his life There is nothing he can do
about it He knows it But in any case McNamara futilely
attempts to lift his M4 in his one last chance to save his
own skin

Rambo takes his head clean off with one bullet the head
disintegrating into liquid and brain tissue upon impact The
blood splatter is almost instantly washed off the wall behind
him from the now heavy rain Blood is gushing up from the
stump of the neck all over the falling corpse of McNamara It
splashes down onto the ground and floats in its own puddle of
blood and rain water

EXT CARPARK(FRONT OF STORE) - MOMENTS LATER

Rambo is walking out into the car park in front of the store
The RAIN is heavy and there is THUNDER in the air It’s like
God himself is trying to wash away the blood from the streets
of Holbrook

Probably the first time it’s rained here in a long time
Rambo has the M82 Barrett snipers rifle hung over his
shoulder He pulls out a Berreta from his back waist of his
pants

Cocks the chamber

Rambo walks past the charred remains of the two UH-60
helicopters towards the body of Eric Galt

Or toward where the body was
He’s gone

Rambo realizes that he’s out in the open and vulnerable but
it’s too late as an arrow hits him in the arm knocking the
M82 from his grasp and knocking Rambo back onto the ground

Rambo gets to his knees He makes to pull the M82 from off
his shoulder A large black boot kicks it away from his hand
as he is just away to grab it

RAMBO’S POV

Looking up to see a wild demented looking Eric Galt snarling
down at him

He smiles then delivers a powerful boot across Rambo’s face
knocking him back

Rambo rolls a few feet back across the car park As he rolls
over the arrow imbedded in his arm snaps off leaving a large
shard of arrow still lodged inside him

Rambo SCREAMS in pain when it snaps off

When he comes to a stop Rambo immediately grabs his
shoulder His teeth are tight but there is blood dripping
from his mouth

GALT
I guess it was always coming down
to this That we’ll be the last two
left to fight it out I’ve dreamed
about this so many times

He kicks Rambo again but this time Rambo grabs his boot
before it makes contact He quickly twists it with great
force There is the sound of SNAPPING BONE from within Galt’s
leg

Galt goes to the ground SCREAMING to the high heavens His
leg is broken at the shin His foot is almost hanging off his
leg in an unnatural and very painful position
Rambo gets to his feet and makes his way to Galt
Galt lifts the crossbow But Rambo is already on him

He pins down his arm to the ground with his foot and presses
down hard Galt releases the crossbow SCREAMING

RAMBO
How’s the dream working out now

Galt is SCREAMING in pain Tears running down his face
Clutching at his leg

Rambo pulls out his knife
Staring down on his prey

Rambo in fg with his knife out In the bg lights fill the
sky and the sound of PROPELLERS hovering above them

Rambo turns to see the MD-530 shining a beam of light into
his face

INT MD-530 - CONTINUOUS

Burns and Boyd are looking down at Rambo from the pilot seats
of the helicopter The search light beam illuminating the
grizzly scene below

They see Galt lying on the ground below him clutching his
leg Rambo is over him with his knife

Boyd starts to fire down on Rambo with the remote operated
machine guns

BURNS
(shouting)
NO DON’T Youll hit Galt

Burns grabs Boyd’s arms away from the controls

EXT CAR PARK - CONTINUOUS
Rambo dives next to Galt

Rambo grabs Galt up and uses his body as a human shield
Knowing that they won’t shoot and risk killing their own
commander

Galt is SCREAMING as he gets dragged back Hopping on his one
good leg

Burns lands the helicopter He then takes his hands off the
stick and raises them in a ‘Hands Off’ gesture

He knows he’1ll have to play this cool

EXT CAR PARK - CONTINUOUS

Rambo slowly backs away from the helicopter He throws Galt’s
body over his good shoulder and turns to run

Rambo runs past the store and down the street to the right
hand side

Burns is caught off guard and prepares the MD-530 for lift
off

Get out there and see where he’s

Boyd reluctantly jumps out of the helicopter and runs after
Rambo

Boyd follows Rambo down the street to his bike

Rambo spots him and reminds him to lay off by pointing his
knife to Galt’s neck

Boyd stays back

Rambo is flying down the highway

Towards him is a large 4 lane over pass intersection

IE MD-530
CLOSE ON Boyd pointing ahead
BOYD
There’s the bastard Up ahead He’s
going through the underpass

The MD-530 makes chase towards the underpass

EXT INTERSTATE 40
Rambo goes under the motorway

The helicopter flies over the motorway expecting Rambo to
come out the other side

He doesn’t

IE MD-530
Burns and Boyd look confused

BURNS
The fuckers vanished again

The helicopter hovers down in front of the exit on the other
side of the underpass

The road is empty

BURNS (CONT’D)

FUCK THIS GUY
It’s as if Rambo has just vanished into thin air

The helicopter lands and Boyd jumps out
Boyd cautiously enters the underpass with his M4 up and ready
for action Slowly proceeding under the motorway above
EXT MD-530 - CONTINUOUS
With Boyd checking out the underpass from the ground Burns

keeps a look out from the air

ARIEL SHOT OF HELICOPTER FLYING OVER THE OVERPASS
INTERSECTION

IE UNDERPASS

Boyd is walking deeper into the underpass but sees nothing
He comes out the other side

He sees that workmen have been working here There are
traffic cones and a small porta cabin maybe containing
toilets

He shakes his head Rambo wouldn’t be stupid enough to trap
himself in the porta cabin He would be a sitting duck

He looks to his left and sees that there is a dusty hill or
mound leading up to the motorway above Boyd suddenly sees
something that looks a little odd It’s as if the ground
looks fake

He walks over cautiously while looking around him 360
degrees He hears a muffled sound as if someone was trying to
say something but couldn’t because he or she was gagged

In the bg a dark figure appears from nowhere Rambo is
hanging from one of the concrete support beams from under the
overpass He drops silently down onto the roof of the porta
cabin

Boyd can definitely hear sounds of distress

He runs over to the area of ground that just doesn’t look
right

Boyd realizes that this area of ground isn’t dirt at all
It’s a large dust colored TARP that has been spread out over
the surface

Boyd crouches down and lifts the edge of the tarp up to
reveal a large TRENCH dug down into the earth

At first he only sees old tools that the workmen must have
left Then as he lifts the tarp higher to reveal more of the
hole he sees Galt tied to the top of Rambo’s bike
BOYD
(via headset)

Jesus Ive found him He’s hidden

is some trench by the south side of

the underpass

BURNS (V0O)
Roger coming in

Then a thought hit Boyd

But where is Rambo

It suddenly dawns on Boyd But before he has a chance to
react Rambo is already on him from behind

ANGLE ON BOYD’S NECK

As we see Rambo’s knife come protruding out of the front of
Boyd’s neck as his head is pulled back

Rambo has his head by the hair and is twisting and turning
the knife to make as much damage as he can

Boyd is gagging and coughing up blood as well as spraying
blood from the exit wound of Rambo’s knife

He falls down in a heap

Rambo grabs his headset and microphone

EXT UNDERPASS (SOUTH SIDE)

Burns lands the helicopter on the south side of the
underpass’s entrance

He jumps out and races over to the road the workmen have been
working on He sees the Porta Cabin and runs over to it
Burns goes inside

We see Burns rush out of the cabin looking disappointed He
surveys the area Then he sees what he must have been
dreading since he lost radio contact with Boyd a moment ago
The bloody corpse of Boyd all twisted and deformed lying
lifeless on the dirt beside a large hole

He runs over to the corpse knowing that it’s too late to do
anything for his brother in arms

Burns can see that Rambo had almost severed Boyd’s head off
from the rest of his body Only a few arteries and veins
keeping the head of Boyd loosely attached to his body

He looks up at the large hole in front of him while still in
shock

He sees Rambo’s bike but there is no Galt to be seen
Burn’s heart is pumping so loud it’s all he hears

He drops to his knees almost in surrender Hoping maybe Rambo
will take care of him quickly and cleanly

Burns is suddenly startled by what must have seemed like the
voice of the grim reaper in his ear

RAMBO (VO)

Hey Burns It’s not over yet

Now Burns realizes that Rambo has been listening in to their
chatter all night

BURNS
(panic)
Go to hell you bastard

looking through Galt’s binoculars at Burns from a distance

He has the headset to his mouth

I don’t understand You have the

advantage
RAMBO

Just get back in your bird and

youll see I always keep my

BURNS
Rambo are you still there

There is only STATIC from the other end

Burns is even more confused and fearful after his
conversation with Mr Death

He rushes back to his helicopter

EXT CHOLLA LAKE(OUTSIDE OF TOWN) - DAWN

It is getting light quickly but Rambo still lights a couple
of flares He throws them onto the ground at the edge of the
lake The vivid green smoke from each flare is rising into
the atmosphere for all to see

Rambo grabs his backpack and rifle He looks back

RAMBO’S POV-

-Galt is tied to a large water pipe that comes out from the
lake The pipe goes over the top of the mound down towards
the road on the other side of the hill

This pipeline hugs the highway for a few miles until it cuts
off toward the power plant a few miles away

Galt starts to laugh

GALT
I know what your up to
RAMBO
(more sarcasm)

You’re a smart guy

Rambo leaves him there as he runs off into the distance

EXT MD-530 - MOMENTS LATER

The helicopter rises into the sky above the intersection

INT MD-530 - CONTINUOUS

After a moment to collect his thoughts and get his head back
on the job Burns sees something in the distance It looks
like a flare

BURN’S POV-

- showing green smoke rising up off in the distance behind a
hill on the highway’s right-hand side

BURNS

Burns moves the stick in the smokes direction

Maybe Galt is still alive after all

Maybe Rambo will keep his word

EXT CHOLLA LAKE(OUTSIDE OF TOWN) - MORNING

It is dawn The sun is just coming up The rain has stopped
and it looks like the beginnings of a beautiful day There is
an orange glow over the surface of the still water of the
lake

Galt is tied up on the top of a large pipe that protrudes
from the lake He is looking across the lake to his right

We hear his SHOUTS

GALT
(screaming)
RAMBO I’LL SEE YOU IN HELL FOR
THIS

He is tied up by his own plastic strapping by his hands
around the metal supports that keeps the pipe attached to the
hill

GALT (CONTD)
(more shouting)
RAMBO YOUR A DEAD MAN
(beat)
YOUR TIME WILL COME

The MD-530 hovers down into the frame Galt in bg and the
helicopter in fg

Burns lands the helicopter just in front of the pipeline on
the shore of the lake to Galt’s left and jumps out to aid the
beleaguered Galt

Galt turns back to look at Burns

He is shaking his head “NO”
Burns runs to Galt anyway

BURNS
Thank God you’re OK sir

Galt starts to laugh

BURNS (CONTD)
What’s so funny

GALT
It’s a trap Burns

Galt turns to his right and looks over to the other side of
the lake

His eyes widen

leaving the barrel

It’s like the world has just stopped for that one painful
second

The bullet is the only thing moving in a world stuck on
‘pause’

CLOSE ON bullet SPINNING in the air

It makes its way to its real target passing the stationary
Burns and Galt

The real target that is -

- the NAPALM BOMB that is attached to the undercarriage of
the MD-530

ANGLE ON BOMB- The bullet connects to the nose of the bomb

FREEZE FRAME WITH BULLET TOUCHING THE CONTACT FUSE

A BEAT

Then

BOOOOOM

It’s fury is unleashed

Rambo did keep his word Galt and Burns did leave this earth
together both straight to hell

EXT CHOLLA LAKE ( OTHER SIDE) - SAME TIME

As soon as Rambo fires his weapon he dives into the lake in
front of him for cover As soon as he’s under the water’s
surface there is already a orange canopy of fire covering
the whole of the lake

UNDERWATER SHOT FROM BELOW RAMBO

as we see his black silhouette in the fg swimming and the
bright fire of the explosion in the bg on the water’s
surface

EXT CHOLLA LAKE(OUTSIDE OF TOWN) - CONTINUOUS

The bodies of both Galt and Burns are instantly burnt to a
crisp The crisp corpses turning to powder The powder then

blowing away into nothing by the force of the explosion

The MD-530 is part of history now Almost no trace is left

ARIEL SHOT OF THE LAKE

The massive napalm explosion is enormous Rising high and
wide over the whole lake area It is both spectacular and
devastating all at the same time

DISSOLVE TO

EXT CHOLLA LAKE(OUTSIDE OF TOWN) - LATER

The same ARIEL SHOT from above of the same location but
some time has passed by

Everything is smoky and black The surrounding trees and
cactus’s are stripped naked and charred The smell of
kerosine permeates the air

There are several cop cars spaced out below in the frame at
the side of the highway Cops are running up and down the
hill leading to the lake all doing their thing

Some are even just standing there scratching their heads in
disbelief

A black pick-up truck comes into the shot and comes to a halt
by the side of the road The driver’s side door opens and
Teasle steps out

Teasle makes his way slowly up the hill accompanying the
pipeline He gets to the ridge and looks down at the
devastation

Weaver turns and sees Teasle on the top of the hill He
rushes up a few yards up the mound to his sheriff

WEAVER
I can’t imagine anybody surviving
something like this

TEASLE
You’1l be surprised

Teasle looks around at the carnage Taking a deep breath of
the side effects of an Napalm explosion

TEASLE (CONTD)
God awful smell

Shaking his head He looks around to the ground looking at
the dirt

He spots something

His eyes narrow

Teasle walks over to a area of dirt on the peak of the ridge
and crouches down

Weaver follows him
POV OF TEASLE
to see TIRE TRACKS

WEAVER
Tire tracks and they’re fresh

TEASLE
(smiling)
Yeah he came back to admire his
handy work

WEAVER
Surely you don’t think Rambo is
still alive

TEASLE
Of course he is These tracks were
made just after the explosion By a
1972 Harley XR750

WEAVER
How do you know

TEASLE
It’s his father’s bike He had hid
it in a trench down by the
underpass Left his calling card
there too

WEAVER
His calling card

TEASLE
Another mutilated corpse with it’s
head severed

WEAVER
I’m gonna send out an APB

TEASLE
(sharply)
No I don’t want you to do
anything just yet

WEAVER
(looking shocked)
You want us to just let this
murdering psychotic go free

TEASLE
(turning sharply to stare
forcefully at Weaver)
That’s precisely what I want I’1l
take care of Rambo myself

EXT GARAGE - 2 WEEKS LATER

Rambo is hauling out old bike parts from a garage and is
loading up a truck The owner of the garage a Mr WILLIAMS
comes out of his office and goes over to Rambo

WILLIAMS
That’s great work John After you
take that stuff over to Earls you
can finish up for the day

RAMBO

(confused)
But I only just started a couple of
hours ago

WILLIAMS

Yeah well I need a favor John I’m
kinda backed up with work at the
moment and I don’t have anyone to
do the night shift tonight I was
hoping you would be able to work
tonight

RAMBO
(nodding)
Sure Mr Williams I can work
tonight

WILLIAMS
Thanks John I knew I could count
on you If you can take care of the
Morrison’s motor and Andy’s bike
that would be a load of my back

RAMBO
No problem

WILLIAMS
Come by about 8 tonight How’s
that

RAMBO
Sure What about tomorrow

WILLIAMS

Don’t worry about tomorrow John
I’1l work something out so you’1ll
get all the sleep you need Just
make sure you have plenty of coffee
for tonight

(beat)
How’s the arm You should go and
get it checked out son

Mr Williams smiles at Rambo
RAMBO
(rubbing his wound)
It’s not too bad
(beat)
I just want to say thank you Mr
Williams for all your help I
really appreciate it
WILLIAMS

I know Better get that stuff over
to Earls now son

Rambo jumps into the pick-up truck and drives off
CLOSE ON WILLIAMS

as his eyes narrow

INT GARAGE - NIGHT

Rambo has been working for 4 straight hours without a break
It’s just after 12 and he has just finished his 2nd motor

He throws the wrench back into the metal tool box and goes
over to the coffee machine He feels the pot It’s cold so
he turns it on and waits for it to heat up
VOICE (0S)
Do you mind making me a cup as
well
Rambo turns around

CLOSE UP ON RAMBO’S FACE

as his expression suddenly changes

RAMBO
(shocked)
Teasle

Will Teasle steps in out of the shadows

TEASLE
(sarcastic)
Well it’s nice to see you too

Rambo suddenly makes to bolt out of the back of the garage
but hears the sound of GUN BARRELS COCKING all around him

Rambo looks around him and sees about 20 men with deputy
badges on and with shotguns pointing in his direction

He looks towards Teasle and sees that Teasle with an M4 in
his gloved grasp has about another 10 or so more men behind
him all armed and all aiming in his direction

TEASLE (CONTD)
Oh it’s been a long time coming
this day

RAMBO
How did you find me

TEASLE

I planted a tracking device on your
father’s bike I knew that would be
the last thing you would get rid
of Sentimental reasons and all

(laughing)
I even helped him fix it up by
getting parts for it from time to
time You know the ole saying of
‘Keeping your friends close but
your enemies closer’

RAMBO
Are you taking me in

TEASLE
(sighing)
Isn’t it a bit late in the day for
that

RAMBO
Youre still a cop

TEASLE
(nodding)
Yeah I’m still a cop
(beat)
(MORE)

TEASLE (CONTD)
But I’m so close to retirement In
fact
(he looks at his watch)
I think it’s as good a time to
retire now as any What do you
think John

RAMBO
(angry)
Why don’t you just do it Teasle

TEASLE
Don’t worry John that’s
inevitable But I just want you to
know one thing before you go down
I couldn’t have done it without
your old mentor Trautman

Rambo looks confused

TEASLE (CONTD)
Yeah good old commander Sam
Trautman gave me some words of
advice all those years ago It’s
ironic that those immortal words
became so true

(beat)

I thought he was just jerking with
me but he did say to ‘leave it
alone’ Let ‘Rambo slip away and
youll pick him up working at a car
wash’ or something a few weeks
later Of course I was too
stubborn and rash to heed those
words of advice then but I’ve had
30 years to think them over Isn’t
it the irony of ironies that those
words became so prophetic

RAMBO
You set me up

TEASLE
(smiling)

Of course I set you up I knew Galt
and his boys would fuck it up I
took a back seat and let it all
play out I wanted you to get nice
and comfortable here Williams was
kind enough to give you a job but
he did take off the tracking device
for me before you could find it So
it gave me time to round up the
guys here

(MORE)

TEASLE (CONTD)
Another few weeks wasn’t going to
break me I mean for chrissake
I’ve been waiting for 30 goddamn
years I wanted to make you feel as
comfortable as possible before I
moved in It makes it all the more
sweeter for me

Teasle looks around him at his entourage of men

TEASLE (CONTD)
(laughing)

Some might say this is a little
overkill for taking down one man I
would say it’s about even Everyone
one here is a volunteer from my old
stomping ground in Oregon They all
wanted to be here for this I just
deputized them all Kind of makes
it official so to speak

RAMBO
Your full of it Teasle

(through clenched teeth)
Just put an end to this before you
bore me to death

Teasle is clearly affected by Rambo’s slur

TEASLE
(angry)
Fine Here catch

Teasle throws Rambo the M4 from his gloved hands It’s the
old trick You instinctively catch it without thinking Rambo
fell for it Maybe he caught it deliberately or maybe not
well never know But the M4 is empty anyway

A MAN to the right of Teasle fires into Rambo’s shoulder
wounding him badly Rambo falls backwards onto the ground

Another MAN fires into Rambo’s opposite shoulder while he is
sprawled on the ground Rambo SCREAMS is agony

A third MAN blows off Rambo’s leg by shattering the shin in
two The bottom of his leg is separated below the knee

The last MAN takes off his other leg above the knee Blood is
pouring from 4 major wounds Rambo has only seconds left

But Rambo is defiant He slowly lifts his head and stares
into Teasle’s eyes

RAMBO
(blood gagging out of his
mouth)
You’re nothing but a coward Teasle

TEASLE
You may have won all the battles
Rambo but you’ve just lost the
war
(beat)
Just like in Vietnam

Teasle takes out his side arm from his holster and points it
at Rambo’s head

The final coup de grace

Rambo’s head slumps off to the side before Teasle could pull
the trigger

Rambo is dead before Teasle could deliver the final death
blow

Teasle puts two of his fingers to Rambo’s neck to check his
pulse

TEASLE (CONTD)
You son of a bitch

Rambo ironically dies not from Teasle’s hand after all
Rambo’s final ‘Fuck You’ to Teasle

FADE TO BLACK

THE END
