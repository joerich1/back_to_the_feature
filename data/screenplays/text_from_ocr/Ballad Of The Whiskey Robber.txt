Good evening I kiss your hand

EXT THE GLOBAL SKATING RINK - DAY

On an infinite snowy plain we find that the world is not
so much a stage as it is a HOCKEY RINK

NARRATOR
Allow me friends to tell you of
a once great empire A proud land
that dominated the game of
nations

Into frame skates a HOCKEY PLAYER with the flag of the
AUSTRO-HUNGARIAN EMPIRE upon his chest his shoulders
decorated with gold-braid epaulets

NARRATOR

My country Hungary

(the Player seems annoyed

at your reaction)
Okay okay it surprises even us
But it is fact For a thousand
years we had been plundered and
conquered so relentlessly defeat
became as a national pastime But
patiently we toiled until our time
arrived and we became the
mightiest superpower on the
planet

From nowhere another PLAYER roars into frame and knocks
Austro-Hungary flying

NARRATOR
Unfortunately it did not last

As Austro-Hungary hits the ice he SPLITS into TWO KIDS
each wearing a Hungarian Flag jersey They get up
confused

NARRATOR
For daring to greatness our
country was cut in two Half of
our land was given away

A BRUTISH ADULT IN A USSR JERSEY takes charge ordering
the HUNGARIAN KIDS into position All the Eastern Block
nations are represented by KIDS IN FLAG JERSEYS
NARRATOR
A once united people were forever
torn apart

The Hungarians are separated one being forced to play
with a larger ROMANIAN KID

His EASTERN BLOC KIDS now in place the Soviet Player
faces off against his opponent an adult in a USA JERSEY

The American is flanked by KIDS WEARING THE JERSEYS OF
HIS ALLIES ENGLAND FRANCE CANADA JAPAN etc

The Cold War begins The teams skate menacingly but
avoid all out conflict

NARRATOR
Though unhappy with this new world
order we humbly returned to our
place as pawns in the game

The EXILED HUNGARIAN now forced to play with the
Romanian looks after his twin longingly

NARRATOR
While those living in exile longed
for the day when they could return
to the homeland and be one again

The Exiled Hungarian is struck from behind by the bigger
Romanian kid and knocked down He doesn’t hit ice but
MUDDY GROUND and we find we are

EXT FITOD VILLAGE - DAY

The little Hungarian is SIX YEAR-OLD ATTILA AMBRUS He
proudly wears a Hungarian hockey jersey

NARRATOR
One such boy was Attila Ambrus
And if youll peer closely gentle
viewers you might see within this
ragged lad the very soul of my
people

Two drunken ROMANIAN SOLDIERS have pushed him down They
tear his Hungarian jersey off and kick him in the ass

ROMANIAN SOLDIER
Bozgor

SUPER TITLE “Fitod Romanian 1972”
Attila runs home down the pitiful dirt main street of
Fitod carrying his skates and a hockey stick It’s a
quaint little village of old wooden houses

NARRATOR
His fly-speck village was taken
from us when the maps were
redrawn and he became a second-
class citizen in a country that
did not want him

Attila stops at a GROCER where a KINDLY OLD WOMAN is
waiting Attila hands her a coin and she gives hima
CAST IRON POT

NARRATOR
And that was not acceptable to a
little boy who’s very DNA carried
the imprint of our former glory

Attila enters his modest house a thick curl of smoke
coming from the chimney

INT VILLAGE SMOKEHOUSE - DAY

Cuts of meat hang from the ceiling Attila enters and
stands against the wall as BEAUTIFUL HAM STEAKS are
handed to gruff COMMUNIST APPARATCHIKS

ATTILA’S FATHER smiles until they are gone He turns
grumpily to the dinner table opens the pot Attila
brought and spoons PIG’S FEET onto plates Father
watches The Flinstones dubbed in Romanian on a
ridiculously small TV while he guzzles palinka

Attila pulls a PHOTO of his MOTHER from a drawer and

brings it to the table She’s a simple yet pretty woman

ATTILA’S FATHER
What the hell is that

ATTILA
It’s my birthday today father I
want to have dinner with my
mother But you won’t take me to
see her so

He sets the photo against his water glass
ATTILA’S FATHER

She abandoned you you idiot She
doesn’t want you
ATTILA
When she sees what a fine man I’ve
grown into she’1ll change her mind

ATTILA’S FATHER
(he grabs the picture and
rips it up)
Eat your feet

Defiantly Attila drops his plate on the floor His
father leaps up and begins beating him
EXT FITOD - THE NEXT DAY

Attila gives the Old Woman a coin and gets another pot

INT VILLAGE SMOKEHOUSE - DAY

Attila puts the pot on the table His father spoons food
onto his plate Attila pushes the plate away refusing
to eat It’s a hunger strike

His Father dumps Attila’s food onto his own plate and
eats without him

INT VILLAGE SMOKEHOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

Attila’s Father spoons out the food Again Attila
refuses to eat Again his Father takes his portion

INT VILLAGE SMOKEHOUSE - DAYS LATER

EXT NEIGHBORING VILLAGE - DAY

Attila’s Father drags him to a run-down house From the
porch hangs a RED LANTERN

ATTILA’S FATHER
Go See your mother

He pushes Attila towards a window The young boy cups
his hands against the glass and peers inside -- he sees
his MOTHER nude laughing in bed with a NAKED MAN
Attila recoils turning to his father in disbelief

ATTILA’S FATHER
Happy

His father walks away A heartbroken Attila has no
choice but to follow him home

NARRATOR
The knowledge that his mother had
chosen the life of a wanton over
her own spawn planted a seed of
discord in the young lad’s belly

FADE TO

EXT VILLAGE SMOKEHOUSE - ROOF - DAY - NINE YEARS LATER
We hear a communist radio broadcast

NARRATOR
Watered by his father’s alcoholic
violence the little seed took
root

Affixed to the chimney is a coat hanger antenna We
follow the wire down the roof and through a window

NARRATOR
and grew into a sinewy bush of
self-loathing

A veil of static and then the complicated guitar work of
YNGWIE MALMSTEEN

INT ATTILA’S ROOM - DAY - NINE YEARS LATER

The wire leads to a cheap radio Hands with leather
wrist-bands carefully tune in a pirate broadcast

NARRATOR
Fortunately Attila’s mounting
frustration found two outlets
One was via clandestine rock n’
roll

TEEN ATTILA now 15 bops his mullet haircut air
guitaring frantically He gives a devil horn salute to
his contraband ACDC poster before covering it with a
Romanian flag
EXT BOARDING SCHOOL HOCKEY RINK - DAY

A large crowd has gathered to watch two BOARDING SCHOOL
TEAMS go at it The stands are packed with WELL-TO-DOS
while the POOR VILLAGERS stand in the snow

NARRATOR
The second came on painted ice
where Attila played with maniacal
savagery

Through the pack of students barrels Attila in his
threadbare hockey gear

NARRATOR
His reputation as an enforcer was
such that he was brought in as a
ringer for the local boarding
school

These rich kids don’t stand a chance against a pissed-off
Attila He knocks one man down then SLAMS the guy with
the puck They fight over it trading blows Attila
finally beats the guy down and steals the puck

He skates on towards the TERRIFIED GOALIE At the last
moment Attila passes to a TEAMMATE and BODYSLAMS the
goalie His Teammate scores Game over Chaos

Attila lays on the ice battered and exhausted He
notices a teen cutie KATALIN eyeing him from the
Villager’s section He smiles at her through bloody
teeth She smiles back

LOSING CAPTAIN
This is bullshit That ape
doesn’t even go to your school

PREP SCHOOL KID

His Teammates help Attila up slapping him on the back

EXT A CORNFIELD - DAY
We track past row upon row of corn

to prejudice

herself to sever the bonds that
tied them

Her FATHER watches from a distance as a DOCTOR pulls a
tool from the satchel

happening Everyone dances drinks celebrates A FUNKY
POLKA BAND rocks the house

EXT CHURCH RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT
Attila watches bitterly through the window Then the

band takes a break Drunks stagger out the side door and
wander off leaving the door open
NARRATOR
What would you do dear viewer
Heart sick facing a bleak future
impoverished and alone

Attila sneaks up eyeing the band equipment just inside
the door He grabs a fancy accordion and makes his
escape But his worn shoes slip on the ice and he falls
crushing the instrument beneath him

Not to be foiled he heads back inside grabbing a small
PICCOLO CASE and a huge TUBA CASE In the process
knocking over a CRASH CYMBAL The noise attracts the
MUSICIANS who chase Attila into the night

INT POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

Attila is cuffed in a chair He sits across a desk from
two UNIFORMED COPS The Cops open the instrument cases
and smile Attila looks on confused until they turn the
cases for him to see they’re empty Attila curses
himself

ROMANIAN COP

usually let a local boy off with a
warning But you’re not
exactly one of us

EXT DETENTION FACILITY - DAY
Distant grainy BW photos of a gulag-like prison camp
NARRATOR
He was jailed in a youth detention

facility on the Moldovan border

More long range surveillance photos of a place so
sinister you wouldn’t dare get any closer

NARRATOR
He would emerge a man with
nothing to his name but an eight
inch scar on his arm
Quick flashes of an obscured act of violence
NARRATOR
Concerning what happened inside
he would say nothing

We hear the ominous SCREAMS of the damned

the Romanian flag and rolls up his prized possession his
ACDC poster

ATTILA
I’m leaving I’m going to escape
to Hungary

ATTILA’S FATHER
Bah Good riddance There’s
nothing there Where ever you go

nobody

No worse words could come from a father But Attila
musters an understanding and sympathy few people could

ATTILA

It’s not where we belong Come
with me I can’t leave you here
Let me take you home

His Father’s eyes harden

ATTILA’S FATHER

respect Attila let’s himself be held

ATTILA’S FATHER

hands I go where I want you

His Father shoves Attila towards the door and throws a
glass at him

ATTILA’S FATHER
Get out You’re expelled from my
life I’m the one who pities

a drunken heap on the floor Attila turns to go

EXT BORDER CROSSING - DAY

There’s a CROW on a wire A rifle CRACKS and the bird
EXPLODES in a cloud of black feathers

of corn as crow feathers flutter down on him

He grits his teeth and crawls closer to a RAILROAD

Sharpshooter is watching the tracks like a hawk Crosses
litter the hillside commemorating his kills

Another train begins to pull out Attila looks to the
tower does a double take The Sharpshooter is taking a
smoke break with his back to Attila

Holy shit Attila slings a cardboard tube onto his back
and gets into a crouch As the train picks up speed

Attila takes off Bent low he sprints through the corn
Trips Eats it hard Then he’s back up again huffing
and puffing but the train is passing him by

Then a miracle a handrail He grabs it and is jerked
off his feet He SLAMS into the train and almost falls
One of the guard dogs BARKS

Attila climbs onto the GRATING between cars and swings
himself beneath it and onto the coupling The massive
wheels are inches away His cardboard tube breaks free
and gets sucked under the wheels

Now all the dogs BARK The Sharpshooter unslings his
rifle aims it at the train But he can’t see Attila
under the grating Attila hangs onto the slippery
coupling as the train crosses the border

poster blowing across the tracks

His teeth chatter with cold but he smiles as he hums
along to the tune And then impulsively he starts to
sing Belting it out with joy

ATTILA
Technically correct But I have
escaped I’m here I made it

ATTILA
Forgive me I couldn’t sleep I
stood outside all night so I could
be the first in line this morning
I don’t want to wait another
minute Hit me with it brothers

with Hungarians getting their first taste of the West

the salt

given

GUSTAV BOTA
Okay Attila Ambrus from
Transylvania Get out there

Attila gingerly steps onto the ice He hasn’t played
since that prep school game years ago He clomps to the
net in front of which the much larger UTE players prowl

At the COACH’S whistle someone fires a puck at Attila
It blows right into the net Attila flopping to the ice a
full second later

ATTILA
Nice shot comrade

The players look at him dubiously Another puck is
fired It too finds the net Attila again flailing

ATTILA
Good one comrade

Now the pucks come faster WHOOOMP WHOOMP They drill
into the net Attila struggles like Bambi on the ice

Team Captain BELA BENKO lines up a shot

BELA BENKO
I‘1l knock this bumpkin back to
the sticks

Benko’s shot rockets off Attila’s facemask As he
staggers Benko tags another puck off his face There is
a CRACK and blood sprays out Attila’s nose holes

Benko laughs but Attila gets right back up Players slap
pucks at him mercilessly Bota shakes his head as the
Coach blows his whistle

cruel regularity But Attila keeps popping right back
up as if he were in the midst of a championship game

his hand away wipes it on his sleeve Gets in his car

hides his remaining Coffee Can in there He takes the

knobs off for good measure

As he situates his blankets in the middle of the room he
hears something It’s a THUMPING from within the wall

Something large is banging around in there He follows
the noise diagonally down the wall to an AIR VENT

Attila grabs a broom to defend himself as the air vent
pops open A run-down DOG pokes his head out one ear
sticking straight up the other missing

The Dog crawls from the vent and looks at Attila A
moment as the two strays size each other up Then the
Dog wanders over and lays in Attila’s blankets

ATTILA
Hey bozgor that’s my bed

The dog barks at Attila

ATTILA
Look at you Godfather Pardon

He hands Lajos a magnifying glass On the floor is a
scattered pile of PENCILS Lajos bends examining it

LAJOS VARJU
What am I looking at

MOUND OF ASSHEAD
It’s a message of some kind He’s
trying to tell us something with
these pencils

Lajos looks up to see the TV CAMERAS filming him through
the window and feels like a tool

EXT TRAVEL AGENCY - DAY

Lajos waves the Cops to push the media back Suddenly
Laszlo Juszt is in his face with a “Kriminalis” mic

LASZLO JUSZT
Major Major Is it true the
police went to the wrong address

incompetence

LAJOS VARJU
This is a crime scene Back away

Lajos sees something in the street and heads towards it
It’s Attila’s WIG He looks up at the apartment building

LAJOS VARJU

chimney just his fingers showing Two COPS emerge
cautiously The first one slips The other one grabs

him but loses his hat over the edge

COP
Fuck this

They clamber back inside Attila sags with relief

EXT APARTMENT ROOF - THE NEXT MORNING

Stiff fingers slowly unclench from the side of the
chimney Attila moans in pain his hands raw and bloody
His face speckled with the imprint of the brick He can
barely wrap his cramped hand around his bag of loot as a
he picks it up and slowly crawls towards the hatch

EXT DINER - NIGHT

A stiff and haggard Attila walks Eva down the street
She’s dressed to the nines him not so much His hands
are in bandages When he holds the door of a diner open
she balks

EVA
What’s this

ATTILA
On the outside meh But it eats
good

EVA
This is what you call “out of my
league”

Upset she starts walking away

ATTILA
Don’t go

EVA
I’m dressed like an idiot Why in
God’s name did you tell me you
were taking me someplace fancy

ATTILA
I didn’t say fancy I said
special This is special
Please come inside Please

INT DINER - NIGHT

It’s a cozy little hole-in-the-wall local diner Attila
and Eva are already into a bottle of wine and some bread

ATTILA
I was going to take you someplace
with napkins and glasses made of
glass but then I thought you
know the food is nice here And
it’s cheaper
EVA
I thought money was no problem

ATTILA
Lately I’m trying to cut back
You spend too much it leads to
trouble

EVA

That’s very sensible Personally
I’m more comfortable here than
someplace fancy I was just
curious whether you--

ATTILA
One second
(snapping at the WAITRESS)
Hey What am I a mannequin The
lady is starving

WAITRESS
Go choke yourself

ATTILA
Don’t give me that We sat down
long before them

Another PATRON gives Attila a dirty look

ATTILA
Who’s talking to you I’11 come
over and shit on your table
(to Eva)
You were curious

EVA
(mortified)
What
ATTILA
You were saying “I was just
curious whether I” what
EVA

I just wasn’t sure if you’d
brought me here instead because I
somehow embarrass you but I’m
over that now

ATTILA
Okay good

The Waitress slams their plates on the table It’s pig’s

feet
Mmm

mouth)

Attila pauses looking in her eyes

ATTILA

This why I brought you here Eva
To show you this

EVA

Show me what

ATTILA

You look at me and see a sports
star international playboy
Fancy car fancy clothes But
this is the real me I like

Just a guy from a little town in
the mountains This is the real
me Eva a bozgor

EVA

You brought me here to tell me

that

That you’re really a bozgor

in disguise

He nods as if to say “Incredible isn’t it”
decide if he’s joking

EVA

Well thank you for clearing up any
confusion

ATTILA

I’ve got my teammates fooled the
gang down at the casino fooled
but I don’t want to fool you Eva

take twenty pounds

EVA

eat quietly for a while okay

A HALF HOUR LATER
They have finished their food and head to the bar

ATTILA
(ordering coffee)
Two brown and sweet

EVA
To be perfectly honest I wasn’t
going to show up tonight Not to
be mean or anything But a woman
in my position with a child
You have to be careful who you get
involved with

ATTILA
Naturally

On the TV behind her Attila notices “KRIMINALIS” has
come on The PATRONS gather as a “WHISKEY ROBBER”
graphic fills the screen Apparently the show is up in
ratings because the production is much fancier now

LASZLO JUSZT
There has been a startling
development in the saga of the
Whiskey Robber today Without
further ado let’s go to the scene
of his latest caper

Attila watches as the BARTENDER shushes people The star-
struck staff of the travel agency is being interviewed

FEMALE CLERK (ON TV)
I wasn’t sure what to do he
caught me by surprise It’s true
what they say about his eyes So
gentle So masculine

LASZLO JUSZT
His effect on the fairer sex is
now legendary

(MORE)

LASZLO JUSZT (CONTD)
But does this dashing villain have
more on his mind than the ladies

FEMALE CLERK 2
Then he said something shocking
He jumped up and shouted “Give me
the people’s money”

The Locals react to this political twist

LASZLO JUSZT
The People’s Money indeed
Perhaps I have misjudged this
character Maybe instead of a
common thug we are dealing with
the reincarnation of our very own
Robin Hood the legendary folk-
hero Sandor Rozsa

Attila thinks hard about what he actually said

FLASHBACK TO

INT TRAVEL AGENCY - DAY
Attila drunkenly jumps onto the counter

ATTILA
(mumbling drunk)
Give me the money people

ROBBERY CLERK

ATTILA
The people money Give me the
people money

END FLASHBACK
The Locals smile at the screen The Bartender claps
BARTENDER
The People’s Money I knew I
liked this guy

Attila is intoxicated by what he’s hearing So much so
that he hasn’t been paying attention to Eva

EVA

ATTILA
Right right

EVA
Anyway I’d better get home My
sitter is going to cost me a
bundle

LAZLO JUSZT (ON TV)
And where are the cops Major
Lajos Varju of the robbery
division had this to say

Lajos wears a shitty plaid coat his sunglasses
LAJOS VARJU (ON TV)

He’s a coward and I will bring him
down

LASZLO JUSZT (ON TV)
Bold words Major Say what you
will about this drunken desperado
Certainly he’s no saint But
unlike those crooks in parliament
at least the Whiskey Robber has

the integrity to do his robbing
face-to-face And for that I
applaud him

The crowd applauds too Attila is glowing as he escorts
Eva to the door

LASZLO JUSZT
Good evening I kiss your hand
These are dark days for Hungary
friends In staggering fashion
this week the linchpin of the
great embezzlement scheme has been
identified and it is none other
than that supposedly crusading
attorney Marta Tocsik It seems
she was not simply investigating
the Scandal of the Century
“Toxic” Marta was committing it
And as we reel from this news do
we have the stamina to absorb yet
another blow This in the form of
a final bombshell revelation that
“Toxic” Marta has a high placed
cousin in city hall none other
than Thief of Police Berta While
Berta protects this sick succubus
his henchmen in uniform make up
the largest criminal cabal in the
country This year alone has seen
the arrest of 232 police officers
on charges from assault to
extortion Like you good people
I am lost

Laszlo takes a seat in a leather chair The set is even
more fancy than before Each time it just gets slicker

LASZLO JUSZT
My guest tonight is Chief of the
one police division that has so
far escaped this scandal
unscathed Perhaps he is the chap
whom Greek philosopher Diogenes
searched for the last honest man
Head of the Robbery division and
recently promoted to Colonel
Lajos Varjt

The camera reveals Lajos sitting in the chair opposite
Laszlo looking like he’s auditioning for Miami Vice
gold rimmed aviator shades royal blue tie lime green
shirt He smiles uncomfortably

LAJOS VARJU
Hello to the people out there
Laszlo grins

LASZLO JUSZT
Colonel you and I have had a
rough past I appreciate your
coming

LAJOS VARJU
Anything for law and order

LASZLO JUSZT

So tell us what is your angle on
this gross epidemic of police
corruption

LAJOS VARJU
In fairness we would have to look
at each case individually But
what we can say for certain is
what’s symptomatic of our society
in general--

LASZLO JUSZT

Excellent And what is your take
if I can redirect slightly on the
famed bandit known as the Whiskey
Robber The man who has over the
last several years been making
you look like a complete and utter
buffoon

LAJOS VARJU
I don’t think you can say
“puffoon” as a blanket statement--

LASZLO JUSZT

Facts are facts Twenty some
daring heists over the last five
years twenty million florints
gone like a puff of wind froma
widow’s backside He’s drunk yet
he continues to slip from your
grasp like oiled boyhood through a
teenaged fist

LAJOS VARJU
In fact we are closer than ever to
capturing this man and that is
why I am here today to ask your
kind audience if they could help--

He’s got Lajos right where he wants him
LASZLO JUSZT
Pardon my shocked expression
Colonel but I assumed you had
come here to apologize to the
Hungarian people not beg for
their help

LAJOS VARJU
Apologize For what

LASZLO JUSZT

For your performance This
drunken madman has been ransacking
Budapest for half a decade and
youve been as impressive as my
wife in lingerie

LAJOS VARJU
—

LASZLO JUSZT
For shame FOR SHAME Colonel

Lajos pulls out Attila’s baseball hat

LAJOS VARJU
What I am here to share is the
perpetrators hat found outside
the Budakeszi OTP You can see
the logo “Home and Office” Not
many of these were made and
distributed in Eastern Europe

LASZLO JUSZT
And now this witless fumblekin has
the temerity to ask my audience to
do his job for him Perhaps this
is why he has escaped corruption
He is too dense to be worth
putting on the take

LAJOS VARJU

(shouting into the camera)
We‘ve had a run of bad fortune
but I believe this can break the
case wide open This hat is quite
rare so I am putting up with this
abuse in the hopes that someone
out there anyone

EXT A TROPICAL BEACH - DAY

We see palm trees and golden sand

LAJOS VARJU (0S)
-will recognize this hat and
please come forward

Eva pops out of a turquoise blue lagoon laughing
Attila emerges next to her and smothers her in kisses

SUPER TITLE “BALI”

A LOCAL GIRL sells them drinks from a bucket of ice
Attila sips his and watches Eva snooze The tropical
breeze the gentle waves he’s completely relaxed

He reaches out and strokes Eva’s foot And on Attila’s
face we can see that he’s mulling over one of those life
altering decisions you can only make on vacation

EXT BEACH BUNGALOW - NIGHT

From inside the little beach hut we hear their passion

INT BEACH BUNGALOW - NIGHT
Attila and Eva lay naked in bed now spent

EVA
I miss the cold and slush Can
you imagine being stuck here
Petr would never wear shoes Id
have to home school him on the
beach

ATTILA
And the native girls would school
him in the trees

She smacks his arm

ATTILA
Eva What do you think of me
buying the Black and White

EVA
The Black and White That
whorehouse downtown

ATTILA
It’s not a whorehouse it’s a
gentleman’s club

EVA
It’s a brothel

ATTILA
That’s what I said Quality I
want a change Eva Between
hockey and all my business
ventures I feel like a donkey
tied to a millstone

EVA
If that’s what you want

ATTILA
I want it for both of us You
could help me run the place You
could be den mother to the girls

In his crude way she knows exactly what he’s proposing

EVA
I accept

INT JET - DAY

They are flying home holding hands like newlyweds
Attila keeps glancing at her Proud that he popped the
question But nervous

EVA
I’ve been thinking about your
plan To really make it work we
would have to be equal partners
We both put in money we own it
together What do you think

ATTILA
(hesitant)
That makes sense

EVA
I know it’s a risk but I’m
prepared for it

ATTILA
You’re sure

EVA
I think we know each other pretty
well by now If any surprises pop
up well deal with it No matter
what

ATTILA
Promise

EVA
Promise

ATTILA
Okay partner

They shake on it

EVA

too risky buying the Black and

White We should start small

There’s a little bar in Erd in
the suburbs You could take a

management course so we do it

right

ATTILA
No prostitutes

EVA
We’1ll build up

Attila looks at her This isn’t exactly what he had in
mind But her eyes are soft warm soothing

ATTILA
(squeezing her hand)
Yeah okay Okay

Petr slumps off to bed Eva cleans up the kitchen

Attila looks at his textbook “Small Service Business
Management” He tries to concentrate but his mind
wanders

He sees Don YAWNING on the couch He’s bathed in the RED
GLOW of a bubbling LAVA LAMP on the mantle The RED
LIGHT gets him thinking of his past

FLASH BACK TO That day when he visited his mother We
catch a QUICK GLIMPSE of the Red Lantern hanging on her
porch

He snaps out of it and tries to concentrate again

On the wall he sees a PAINTING of a horse drawn wagon
heading down a country road

As he stares at it we PUSH IN on the painting and we can
HEAR the horse clip-clopping away

Just like Katalin did

INT EVAS KITCHEN - NIGHT

Eva finishes with the dishes

There are PEDESTRIANS everywhere waiting for busses

Attila barrels into the intersection only to glance off
the side of a bus His car goes sideways and ROLLS

Once Twice The windows blow out And the bag of
loot is thrown free

The loot bag blows apart spreading florint notes in an
ever expanding cloud The Alfa Romeo slides to a stop
upside-down There is a beat while the Crowd registers
their shock Then they surge forward grabbing at the
swirling cloud of money

Attila shakes the cobwebs from his head Don looks up at
him hurt but very much alive Attila sees the chaos all
around the surreal image of the People’s Money actually
going back to the People and he smiles

Good evening I humbly kiss your

reeling with slack jawed
incredulity over Monday’s verdict
of “not guilty” for that vampire
Toxic Marta While she and her
poisonous police pal Chief Berta
are no doubt sipping champagne
from the gold plated skull of a
peasant we are left to mourn the
disgraceful state of affairs our
country is mired in And yet
even in this new era of corruption
and greed there is hope to be
found in the most unlikely of
places Tonight we will tap a
well of integrity and honor an
inspiration to manhood for us all
from behind the walls of the
Gyorskocsi Street jail

He gestures grandly at a monitor as a VIDEO rolls

to

ATTILA
Twenty-six

INT LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

Never These guys work hard they
have my respect If they are fair
with me I am fair with them I
confessed because they caught me
I’m a thief not a liar Fair is
fair

LASZLO JUSZT
So why have you refused an
attorney

ATTILA
I don’t need one I don’t want a
trial I confessed so let’s get
on with the sentencing Why waste
time and money on a trial I am

Eva sits with Petr watching with rapt attention

LASZLO JUSZT
You are intelligent articulate
courageous self-effacing even
penitent These are not exactly
qualities we associate with people
in jail or for that matter in
public office

ATTILA
Listen I’m just a guy trying to
make a life for himself in an
unfair system I was frustrated
at my lack of opportunities and
took matters into my own hands
Unfortunately I hurt some people
along the way and for that I’m
truly sorry

A tear runs down Eva’s cheek
INT KRIMINALIS SET - NIGHT
On the monitor the interview wraps up

LASZLO JUSZT
(on the monitor)
Unlike certain others you admit
to your crimes What is your
opinion of Marta Tocsik

ATTILA

We both robbed the state It’s
not my place to judge but I doubt
I will get the same treatment

She pinched five times what I did
with the stroke of a pen but
she’s rich I’m poor So I’m
expecting ten years But that’s
the system What can you do

The video image freezes on Attila’s handsome smile
Laszlo Juszt turns to the camera bemused

In the center of a large room Attila is encased in a
glass walled cell He’s bathed by bright lights and
surrounded by heavily armed GUARDS WEARING SKI-MASKS
Lajos enters shocked at the elaborate set-up The glass
door is opened and Lajos is let inside the cell

LAJOS VARJU
Hello Attila Remember me

Attila looks sullen and depressed but he forces a smile

ATTILA
You You were the only true
professional at the police
But I was always one step ahead
of you

LAJOS VARJU
Yes Yes you were
(beat)
Youre adjusting

ATTILA
Sure Now that everything is out
in the open I feel great
(gestures at Guards)
Plus the attention

A quiet moment as they both sit there Locked in his see-
through box the Whiskey Robber looks broken

ATTILA
(forcing a laugh)
Remember when I sent you that
bottle of palinka I bet that
killed you When I saw that on TV
I almost pissed myself

LAJOS VARJU
Yes I remember You were always
very clever

ATTILA
Good times We were a good team
You were the mule and I was the
jockey

Lajos takes stock of Attila debating Moves closer to
him whispers becoming serious

LAJOS VARJU
There’s a reason you haven’t been
charged yet They’re looking to
take you to trial

Not unless they’re planning to

didn’t admit to

ATTILA
Like what

LAJOS VARJU
Ask for a copy of your case file
You have that right

ATTILA
What’s in it

LAJOS VARJU
(shrugs)
I’m the mule you rode out of a
job I don’t have access anymore

ATTILA
I don’t deserve your kindness

As Lajos leaves he pauses at the door

Was it worth it Did you get what
you wanted

INT GYORSKOCSI STREET JAIL - HI TECH PRISON CELL - NIGHT

Attila pores over his case file He finally finds a
phrase that scares him to the core

INT GYORSKOCSI STREET JAIL - HI TECH PRISON CELL - DAY

Keszthelyi is talking to the Masked Guards when he hears
Attila shouting at him through the breathing holes in his
glass cell

ATTILA
Keszthelyi Hey

Keszthelyi walks over confronting the red-faced Attila
ATTILA
“Attempted murder” I told you
everything I never tried to hurt
anyone

KESZTHELYI
So you’ve said

ATTILA
So how the hell are you going to
pin me with attempted murder

KESZTHELYI
You admitted firing your gun
several times

ATTILA
Up in the air to scare the guy
chasing me

KESZTHELYI
One of the witnesses says
different

ATTILA
That’s a lie

KESZTHELYI
Even if he’s mistaken in
principal it’s true Bullets go
up they have to come down
somewhere You’re not dealing
with clowns now Ambrus you’re
dealing with the real police

ATTILA
I’ve played by the rules I don’t
hide behind a lawyer

KESZTHELYI
That’s your choice

ATTILA
I never tried to kill anyone and
you know it

KESZTHELYI
Who’s to say what goes on ina
man’s heart That’s for the jury
to decide

Keszthelyi walks away

ATTILA
(calling after)
I’m telling you straightaway I’m
not going to stand for this I’1l
escape

KESZTHELYI

tagline “Let’s Serve Together”

Then we just stake the place out

Much larger than anything Attila has ever attempted

modern times the Whiskey Robber
has struck again Not only that
but he effected his escape by the
high-tech means of swimming

KESZTHELYI
Basically the man has gotten
lucky What I am about to reveal
will certainly go a long way to
explaining his methods and
actions

INT ULLOI STREET OTP BANK - EVENING

Attila corrals all thirty employees into the back room
and locks the door

KESZTHELYI (0S)
I am sorry to all his demented
female “fans” but I have a
shocking bit of news Our police
psychologists have come to the
conclusion that the Whiskey Robber
is a card carrying homosexual

The safe is open and piled with CASH This is HIS
BIGGEST SCORE EVER

INT TV SOUNDSTAGE - EVENING
Some members of the crowd BOO

KESZTHELYI
These are facts derived from
investigation His homosexuality
leads him to dress in wigs the
robbing is just another symbol of
his perversion

Unfortunately for Keszthelyi the audience isn’t buying
it He’s coming across like a scheming yuppie prick

LASZLO JUSZT
You know he sent me a present the
other day I want to share it
with you This was delivered to
my studio from the Whiskey Robber
himself

He shows off a white T-shirt with a hand drawn phrase on
the back “Corrupt Cops Will Never Catch Me” The
audience laughs making Keszthelyi fidget

LASZLO JUSZT
And on the back

He turns it revealing a crudely drawn whiskey bottle
To the left it says “WR 28” and to the right “HNP 1”

LASZLO JUSZT
Whiskey Robber 28 Hungarian
National Police 1

The audience laughs and applauds

KESZTHELYI
This is just another symptom you
see He’s stupid He doesn’t
know addition He’s committed 27
robberies not 28

The phone on Keszthelyi’s belt RINGS Keszthelyi knows
exactly what that means He freezes face flushed

LAZLO JUSZT
Do you need to answer that

The phone keeps RINGING The audience starts to chatter
Keszthelyi fumbles with the buttons humiliated

INT ULLOI STREET OTP BANK - EVENING

Sirens SCREAM in the distance But Attila isn’t going
anywhere He has made a huge pyramid of CASH in the
middle of the bank floor

He pulls out a bottle of Johnny Walker Red and pours
himself a glass Flashing cop lights fill the room as
the cars screech to a stop outside Attila smiles
totally at peace

beloved country

INT COURTROOM - DAY

Attila gives a passionate speech in his own defense The
packed courthouse is rapt

NARRATOR
As for the Whiskey Robber he
cemented his legend with an
impassioned courtroom speech

ATTILA
and like noble Socrates glass
of poison in hand I demand the
State either give me justice or
stab me here and now

NARRATOR
The prosecutor had no choice but
to drop the frivolous charges of
attempted murder

In the back Keszthelyi exits enraged Eva applauds
As does most of the gallery The JUDGE bangs his gavel

NARRATOR
The judge the very same from the
trial of Toxic Marta was less
than entertained He sentenced
Attila to seventeen years in
maximum security

INT MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON - VISITING ROOM - DAY
Attila is brought in in chains

NARRATOR
His hard time was made somewhat
easier by the arrival of an
unexpected visitor

Attila looks up as a MIDDLE AGED PEASANT WOMAN enters the
room His jaw drops

NARRATOR

Having seen him on television his
mother had travelled far to share
with him a final revelation She
too had been beaten by his father
who eventually drove her from
their village She had not
abandoned Attila after all

They hug both with tears flowing

EXT EVA’S SUPER WASH - DAY
Eva sits eating lunch reading a letter from Attila

NARRATOR
This knowledge will perhaps
provide him the strength to endure
the cleansing he set out for
himself with the distinct
possibility of a reward at the
end

INT MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON - NIGHT
We are close on a leatherbound book

NARRATOR

Far from becoming a gray nobody
Attila’s name is recorded in the
New History of Hungary Not just
as a man who sought acceptance and
respect but as a symbol of a
people who sought the same

(the hands place the book

on a shelf)
And as for me Why was I chosen
to chronicle his tale this ballad
of the Whiskey Robber Well for
one thing proximity

We reveal Laszlo Juszt is the man in the cell He’s ina
prison jumpsuit He turns and addresses the camera

LASZLO JUSZT
Shocked dear friends No more
than I My relentless hounding of
that syphilitic crone Toxic Marta
led to my arrest on charges of
revealing state secrets Behind
concrete walls the Whiskey Robber
and I we are kindred spirits
And who better than a showman to
tell the story of a legend

(MORE )

LASZLO JUSZT (CONTD)
As I can attest the pursuit of
truth is a fool’s errand The
soul of Hungary is steeped not in
coarse fact but in romance And
that’s why you’re here is it not
After all what is a ballad but a
song of love
(he bows)
I kiss your hand

FADE OUT

SUPER TITLE “Attila ambrus is due for release in 2016”

Then

SUPER TITLE “He intends to seek public office”

THE END
Like a final score for the ages
Whiskey Robber fans spray-
painted the number of Attila’s
robberies versus his number of
arrests on the wall of the

he hid during his escape
