want to punch them in the face

Frank hones in on an adorable lop-eared BUNNY

PET STORE KID
Oh shes a real cutie

The kid opens the cage pulls out the rabbit and hands
her to Frank Frank reacts as if the kid just set a bm
in his hands

INT DMITRIS DINER - MORNING

A breakfast crowd of businessmen and students fill the
diner

Outside the window behind these happy eaters Frank
stumbles from his car One eye is swollen shut His
lips are bashed in and bleeding His hair is caked in
blood and gravel His clothes are torn

Frank tucks in his shirt And limps toward the front
door

One YOUNG WOMAN sees him through the window and YELPS
Frank drags himself inside The patrons start to notice
him

In the kitchen Hamilton is furiously trying to keep pace

with the orders stuffed on the order wheel He glances
up to see Frank hobbling toward him like death

his mind and guides him toward the back

HAMILTON

Frank is about to go out the back door when he breaks
down crying This makes Hamilton uncomfortable

HAMILTON
Oh shit Oh no Shit Frank

Frank just looks at the floor shaking with sobs

HAMILTON
When you get down you just need

(MORE )

HAMILTON (CONTD)

He pushes Frank out the rear door

INT FRANKS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Frank sits on the edge of the bed his mashed-up face
clean now staring at his perfect moments They arent

Frank prays on his knees beside his bed

FRANK
God please guide me Let me know
what to do next God please let
me have Sarah back Show me how
I hate you God Im sorry I said
that I dont mean that Just
sometimes This doesnt seem fair
God Other people have good things
Other people have goodness They
have love and tenderness They
have people who care about their
lives Other people arent
humiliated at every turn Other
people have things God Even
starving children in Africa Even
their parents love them But why
God Why was I unlucky enough to
have my soul born in this disgusting
me with this ugly face and this
hair this hair that doesnt comb
and this dumb idiotic personality
People stare at me God and I can
tell theyre amazed that something
so stupid and awkward could even
exist Why am I that Why
Please God Please I know its
selfish But Im just asking for
one thing just this one time and
then I swear Ill never ask for
anything again I just want Sarah
back Please let Sarah be my Sarah
again Amen

Frank gets into bed Turns off the light --

LATER

Frank tosses and turns in bed unable to sleep his mind
on fire with the events of the past few days

He HEARS something at the window

He jerks himself upward in bed The curtains are slightly
parted And between them out in the street he sees

The Holy Avenger staring in at him Frank jumps to the
window The Holy Avenger jogs into some nearby bushes

Frank hears RUMBLING above him He looks up to see

His bedroom wall and ceiling cracking open in front of
him A blinding light seeps through

Frank plops back onto his bed in awe and fear

FRANK (VO)
I have been plagued by visions
throughout my life

FLASHBACK - INT FRANKS CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - NIGHT

Young Frank looks up in shock as Jesus is crawling around
Franks wall like a spider He seems to be having fun

climbing on my trophy shelf

Jesus catches Frank looking

JESUS
Dont worry about it Its nota
big deal Why does everybody take
everything so seriously all the
time

FLASHBACK - INT JOHNNY STOCKWELLS BEDROOM - DAY

that of a grinning devil

FLASHBACK - INT DMITRIS DINER KITCHEN - DAY
Hamilton shakes hands with new employee Sarah

FRANK (VO)
And when I first met Sarah I heard
the words of God

Sarah smiles at Frank

GOD (0S)
Marry her

Frank looks around wondering where the voice came from

FRANK (VO)

I have never known if these visions
were divinely implanted or something
else

BACK TO SCENE

Franks bedroom wall and ceiling crack open further and
more blinding light bursts forth There are no angels
singing only the RUMBLING and the SCREAMS of the damned

FRANK (VO)
But I had never experienced anything
like this

Frank looks down to see his comforter has wrapped around
his arms and legs like shackles He tries to pull away
but is trapped

Numerous tendrils a mix of organics and electronics are
growing out of the walls The tendrils grab Franks head
centering it keeping it still

Two additional tendrils ending in knives move toward
him The knives slice down the sides of his skull Frank
YELPS -- out of fear not pain When the knives are
finished grabber attachments jut out to Franks scalp
They pull back the top of Franks skull like a flip-top
box so that his brain is exposed

A tube-like tendril squirts a sick orange liquid on Franks
exposed brain another tendril swipes a squeegee-type
sponge back and forth over his brain preparing it

And then the colossal FINGER OF GOD composed of purple
red and blue light comes down from the Heavens It
heads through the crack in the ceiling and toward Franks
exposed brain

Frank struggles harder to get away but he still cant
move He SCREAMS Tears roll down his face

And then just barely the Finger of God grazes Franks
brain

Frank freezes Everything becomes silent

PUSH IN on his brain alighting in a pulsing glow --
seemingly for the moment the only part of Frank alive

FRANKS VISION - INT WHITE ROOM

Frank sits on a rusty folding chair in a hazy room of
white nothing He looks around The Holy Avenger is
standing there

HOLY AVENGER
The Finger of God

FRANK
What

HOLY AVENGER
Touching your brain The smallest
tip of the tip of the Finger of
God Even thats too much for a
human beings peanut mind to
comprehend

Frank is speechless

HOLY AVENGER
There is a plan for you Frank
Some of his children are chosen
Okay

FRANK
Okay

The Holy Avenger focuses on something behind Frank and
SNICKERS Frank turns

On the wall there is a large insignia of a crimson hooded-
mask -- like Batmans only without the ears It is backed
by a bright yellow bomb blast over a sky blue wall

BACK TO SCENE (BEDROOM)

Frank opens his eyes Everything is back to normal The
air-conditioner clock birds and other dim sounds of
the night surround him

Frank breathes heavily freaked out

doodles the hooded-mask he saw in his vision the night

trying to decipher its secret

INT FRANKS BEDROOM - DAY

Frank nods Libby reads one of the panels where the
Holy Avenger is saying

LIBBY

Im no different from you or anyone
else Holly All it takes to bea
superhero is the choice to fight
evil

(flips through pages)
Well thats true You have to
admit he has a point

Libbys words ECHO OUT growing LOUDER
LIBBY

Frank stares at her in awe as her words sink in

like grade school kids in a particularly awkward and
violent recess brawl They stretch each others shirts
get their backs all scratched up that sort of thing

twists it so that the eyeholes are on the side of Franks
head The dealer worms his way out from under him

with one arm while putting his mask back in place with
the other

the Crimson Bolt with it The Bolt tries to protect
himself from the blows He stumbles back toppling into
the trash cans

through the channels and comes to another episode of the
Holy Avenger Hes fearful but he cant look away

Tv - INT FACTORY - DAY

The Holy Avenger stands with his teenage compatriots Holly
and Jim Holly is dressed like a slut in heavy makeup
and hot pants Jim is in some lurid West-Hollywood-esque
tight jean shorts The trio walks along an enormous
futuristic powder-gun pointing out a window

HOLY AVENGER
Thats right Holly This gun is
what Demonswill used to spray his
Lust Dust over the city the very
dust that caused you and Jimmy to
dress in those revealing outfits
and download those pornographic
images onto your computer

They walk in front of Demonswill who is tied up with
rope and struggling to get free

HOLLY
Im so stupid Sex is a sacred
act which should only take place
within a loving marriage

The CAMERA TILTS DOWN revealing a pair of large fake
nipple rings on Jim

JIM
No doubt My virginity is something
to be proud of Im going to get
these nipple rings taken out
tomorrow

HOLLY
And to think I missed the field
hockey tournament all because Jim
and I were heavy petting Thank
goodness we didnt do more

DEMONSWILL
If only the two of you would have
had premarital sexual intercourse
I would have won -- and you would
have been damned to hell forever

HOLY AVENGER
But they didnt have intercourse
Demonswill

CLOSEUP - Holy Avenger looks at the CAMERA almost as if
hes speaking directly to Frank

HOLY AVENGER
Because it didnt matter how much
peer pressure Jim and Holly were
under to do what society said was
right -- in their hearts they knew
they couldnt throw away what Jesus
had called them to do

BACK TO SCENE

Frank stares at the TV a bit disappointed by what this
means

EXT TRASH BIN - LATER

Frank is in the bin He finds his trash bag He opens
it -- the costume bolt-rod etc are all still there
INT FRANKS CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Frank drives home The trash bag is beside him

MOMENTS LATER

Franks car stops at an intersection Frank glances up
at the street sign -- BEDLINGTON AVE

He stares at it torn

Hesitantly he flips on his blinker He turns down the
street

EXT JACQUES GATE - MOMENTS LATER

The Crimson Bolt in full costume stands at the giant
gates peering between the rails trying to get a glimpse
of Sarah His car is parked at the curb behind him

He cant see anything He walks along the gates and can
see up over the hill a window with light and LOUD MUSIC
coming through But he cant see whats inside

The Crimson Bolt snaps a short rope with a metal hook-
latch on it from his utility belt

He swings it like a lasso then tosses it toward the top
of the gate The metal latch doesnt hook onto it and
falls back down

He tries again tossing the hook latch toward the top of
the gate This time it bounces off and snaps back into
his eye

FRANK
Ow

The Crimson Bolt puts his special rope away which lets
admit it wasnt really necessary in the first place and
just climbs the gate

ATOP THE GATE

The Crimson Bolt surveys the landscape The grounds are
covered with thick bushes and places to hide

He jumps off the gate

EXT JACQUES GROUNDS - MOMENTS LATER

The Crimson Bolt runs from bush to bush getting closer
to the ranch house

JACQUES RANCH - WINDOW - MOMENTS LATER

The Crimson Bolt arrives at the ranch itself The MUSIC
is louder The Bolt sneaks up to the window and peers
inside --

Toby is walking past the window holding a stack of tightly-
wound packets He stumbles a bit and drops the packets

He starts picking them up and setting them on the window
sill Because of the darkness and glare on the window

Toby cant see the Crimson Bolt even though hes only a
couple feet away Abe approaches Toby

ABE
Toby be fucking careful I dont
want nothing missing

Toby smiles playing the clown how a little guy like him
copes in this macho environment

TOBY
So you want something missing

ABE
What

TOBY
You just said a double-negative
Abe You dont want nothing
missing That means you want
something missing

Abe grabs Tobys head and grinds his fist into Tobys
eye

TOBY
ow

ABE
These people this guy Range he
aint gonna fuck around

TOBY
I know

ABE
You realize how hard we worked
getting this into the country

TOBY
That hurt Abe

Abe walks away Toby picks up his stack and moves to a
table in the back of the room On the table are stacks
of heroin in packets Other THUGS enter from the garage
loading the table with packets Mike is keeping track of
the packets weighing them and writing it all down

Sarah is sitting in a small recliner barefoot waiting
At her feet another thug Quill is preparing a syringe
Jacques watches worried and impatient

JACQUES
All right You ready

QUILL
Almost

MIKE

Hey Jacques what if this stuff
ends up being crap

JACQUES
Hey Mikey no offense but do me
a favor and shut the fuck up

Sarah gazes with lust at the syringe The Thugs stop
what theyre doing and watch in anticipation

QUILL
Okay This is kind of like hitting
the champagne bottle against the
side of the boat huh

The Crimson Bolt watches in horror as Mike slides the
needle between Sarahs toes injecting her with heroin
Sarah tilts her head back in euphoria

JACQUES
How is it

SARAH
Oh God

JACQUES
Thats good

SARAH

Oh God
Sarah is barely able to nod

Jacques HOOTS in triumph He picks the dazed Sarah up by
the shoulders and kisses her hard

And as the Crimson Bolt watches he has a VISION of
JACQUES FACE TRANSFORMING INTO A GOAT-LIKE SATANS

The Crimson Bolt looks at the happy THUGS around them
All their faces have transformed into the rotting faces
of the damned

Only Sarah remains pure glowing like the Virgin

The Crimson Bolt HOLLERS and throws his lead pipe at the
window

The glass SHATTERS The men SHOUT and cover themselves
Faces return to normal

ABE
Fuck

TOBY
Theres a guy there

FRANK
Face the wrath of the Crimson Bolt

Abe pulls a pistol from inside his coat He aims it at
the Crimson Bolt

The Bolt sees this and dashes away

TOBY
Thats Sarahs husband man Thats
him

JACQUES

He just saw everything Get him

Abe shoots out the window at the disappearing figure He
misses

Quill uses a coat to wipe the sharp fragments from the
bottom of the window pane

Quill jumps out followed by Abe Mike and Toby

ON THE GROUNDS

The Crimson Bolt darts around the bushes Behind him he
can see the four men chasing him

Quill sees the Crimson Bolt dash from one bush to another

QUILL
There

Abe and Mike shoot at him

The Crimson Bolt crouches his hands over his head and
waddles toward the fence

The men lose track of him again They fan out

MIKE
Whered he go

The Crimson Bolt runs behind shrubbery along the gate
When he cant see the men anymore he climbs the fence

Abe spots him atop the fence a fair distance away He
aims taking his time

And shoots

The Crimson Bolt is clipped in the leg He falls off the
fence and to the sidewalk on the other side with a HOLLER

But despite the pain he keeps moving He crawls to his
car He flings open his passenger door He pushes himself
inside staying crouched down

Mike appears inside the gate and blasts at the car

The passenger window shatters over the Crimson Bolt He
gets the keys in the ignition

The Crimson Bolt gets the car started Peels away

The men run out the opening gate after him shooting

INT FRANKS CAR

The Crimson Bolt drives woozily He holds tightly to
his leg stopping the flow of blood

Something is on the floor stuck to his boot

Its Libbys pink neon party flyer getting soaked in his
blood

approaches it grabs it Its written in blood

blood spurting like a fountain

The Crimson Bolt leaps inside He and Abe move toward
each other SHOUTING and shooting at each other

They hit each other in the arms But they continue
shooting until they both run out of bullets

The Crimson Bolt lunges toward Abe grabbing him

The two men grapple on the floor They tear at each
others eyes and faces like animals

The Crimson Bolt gets a hold of Abes head He slams it
against a heavy piece of furniture until Abes body falls
limp and dead

The Crimson Bolt looks around

Jacques walks directly over the Crimson Bolt and presses
his gun to the Bolts skull

JACQUES
This is about she loved me more
you cocksucker because Im fucking
interesting

FRANK
Shut up crime

The Crimson Bolt hits a button on his elbow A blade
flies up from his forearm -- hes been wearing the
projectile blade device all along -- and imbeds itself
between Jacques legs

Jacques SCREAMS He topples backward

JACQUES
Oh fuck Oh fuck Oh Jesus
Oh no no no no no

The Crimson Bolt pulls a hunting knife from his belt He
grabs Jacques under the chin pinning him against the
wall and aims the knife at him Sarah watches
hyperventilating and half-covering her eyes Jacques
SOBS

JACQUES
What are you going to do Fucking
execute me for my sins Dont
think youre fucking better than
me you fucking psycho You almost
killed people for butting in line

FRANK

profit from the misery of others
The rules were set a long time

The Crimson Bolt picks up Libbys body He sets her in
the rear of the SUV He uses a newspaper to wipe blood
off her forehead He leans against the car and weeps

INT SUV - MOMENTS LATER

The Crimson Bolt spattered with blood drives while Sarah
sleeps

FRANK (VO)
So maybe you think theres something
wrong with me Maybe you thought
I was going to learn what Jacques
said was true That I was deluded
That I was as evil as the rest of
them

INT FRANKS BEDROOM - MORNING

The Crimson Bolt lies Sarah down on the bed He pulls
the covers up around her

FRANK (VO)

looks

followed it And I saved Sarah

other members look at her listening intently

FRANK (VO)
She needed to go back to her
meetings where she had insights
that struck others uniquely

INT SARAHS BEDROOM - NIGHT
Sarah shifts in her sleep sweating

FRANK (VO)
And sometimes she needed to have
nightmares of those ugly times at
Jacques ranch

PAN TO SARAHS NEW HUSBAND beside her He tentatively
reaches out his hand and places it on her head

FRANK (VO)
Because a kind man a man who was
good and didnt know it needed to
learn how to comfort someone

Sarah wakes Her husband strokes her hair

EXT SARAHS BACKYARD - DAY

FOUR CUTE KIDS GIGGLE and hop through a sprinkler Sarah
and her husband splash and play along

ranch that night

EXT FRANKS KITCHEN - DAY

Frank finds a postcard from Sarah in his mail On the

change the world

INT FRANKS BEDROOM - DAY

FRANK (VO)
That and something much more

REVEAL the bedroom wall in front of Frank It is now
completely covered with cartoons of perfect moments from
Franks life

The Crimson Bolt carrying Sarah and shes saying I
knew youd save me

Frank and Libby laughing as they ride shopping carts at
the gun show

Frank purchasing the bunny
Frank and Hamilton watching a movie
And dozens more

Frank stares at the wall His eyes are wet with tears
He smiles

FADE OUT
