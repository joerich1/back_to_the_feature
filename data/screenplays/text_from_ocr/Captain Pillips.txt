FADE IN on a man in a floating hell We are
INT LIFEBOAT - NIGHT (2 AM)

An enclosed fiberglass LIFEBOAT 28 feet long - with 60
seats and HATCHES fore and aft Its steamy hot even at
night Floating on the Indian Ocean 300 miles from Somalia

RICHARD PHILLIPS sleeps upright in this sweatbox at
gunpoint Hes 50 a career merchant mariner - now a hostage

His captors are four Somali pirates BILAL is 16 his left
foot wrapped in bloody gauze ELMI is 25 has a three-colored
ROPE on his lap NAJEE is 24 Theyre asleep too But

MUSI their leader is wide awake 25 years old 59 maybe
135 pounds A rail-thin killer His hand bandaged and
bloody holds an AK-47 as he studies the sleeping Phillips

After a beat Musi rises and undogs (opens) the AFT HATCH
stepping out onto the lifeboats tiny AFT DECK He lays his
AK at his feet and pees off the edge

Phillips eyes instantly snap open Turns out he was awake
He assesses his options - IMAGES hitting us in a hurry

Three pirates asleep the THREE-COLORED ROPE on Elmis lap
Musis back turned to us the AK on the deck and SIX FULL
FUEL BUCKETS tied down in the boats nose Its time to go

So he rises heads for the aft hatch The rest is a blur

EXT LIFEBOAT - AFT HATCHAFT DECK - CONTINUING

The craft is orange shaped like a submarine Musi pees off
its deck the AK at his feet Phillips can grab it and fire
away He considers that

But a half-mile away lit up like a distant jewel is a US
NAVY GUIDED MISSILE DESTROYER - the USS Bainbridge 508 feet
long Immense powerful here to rescue him - so

He pushes Musi off the deck and dives in We FOLLOW

EXT WATER - CONTINUING - NIGHT

His glasses fly off gone forever in the cool water He
starts swimming madly moonlight shining through Behind him
Musi surfaces howling in Somali at his crew

Next Phillips hears the engine of the lifeboat roaring to
life He swims kicks gasps then he looks back Oh no

The lifeboat is coming at him Musi clinging to its side
Phillips sucks in air and DIVES down Even underwater he can
hear the pirates shouting The lifeboat passes over him then
STOPS idling right atop him Phillips can touch its hull

He surfaces beneath the bow - a quiet breath - grabs the
ENGINE COOLING PIPES under the keel and guides himself along

FOOTSTEPS on the deck above him Pirates howling enraged He
ducks under the boat again comes up on the port side

But waiting there in the water is Musi Oh shit
They lunge for each others throats instantly Hand-to-hand
combat just like that Phillips gets Musis head under

water Musis scream turning into a burble of air

Holding the guy down - Musi flailing kicking - Phillips
trying to drown the bastard until another nightmare

POP POP POP Three rounds from the AK whistling past his ear
into the water He looks up

Elmi on deck Firing Its over Phillips releases Musi

That fast Phillips is yanked out of the water by Elmi and
Bilal thrown through that aft hatch and back inside where

INT LIFEBOAT - CONTINUING
Elmi and Bilal throw him to the floor of the boat Then they

pounce beating the hell out of him Najee jumps in too Shot
after shot swarming like angry bees

NAJEE
We kill you Kill you

Shouting spitting kicking Elmi ties Phillips hands to a
horizontal bar exposing his torso Bilal trusses Phillips
feet to the base of a seat Hes helpless a punching bag

as Musi wet and enraged now steps up Silence Then
MUSI
How much you worth Irish One

million Two million

CRACK A right cross to Phillips jaw staggering him Now
the others join in again pounding spitting shouting

-until gradually they stop - too winded to continue
MUSI (CONTD)

You stay tied now like an animal
And you pee in a bottle
Phillips is a bruised bleeding mess Gasping

PHILLIPS
I cant feel my hands You trussed
‘em too tight

MUST
Like an animal

Phillips tries to chew the ropes Musi hits him again

MUSI (CONTD)
Ropes cant touch your mouth They
are halal

He walks away Najee and Elmi follow leaving Bilal the
youngest to stand guard AK in hand Bilal studies Phillips
perplexed A long quiet beat then he has to ask

BILAL
Why you didnt just shoot us
(Phillips is silent)
Gun was right there Why you dont
just grab it and shoot us

PHILLIPS
I just wanted to go home

Bilal doesnt respond He cant We CUT TO

EXT MAERSK - STARBOARD - AMIDSHIP - NIGHT

The MAERSK ALABAMA is a cargo ship 508 feet long 83 feet
abeam displacing 31000 tons of water Massive With a seven-
story superstructure The House rising from her stern

She idles a mile from the lifeboat as she is boarded by

US NAVY SAILORS - guys climbing up flexible-steel ladders
from two NAVY ZODIACS idling beside the Maersk amidship

INT MAERSK - BRIDGE - SAME

SHANE MURPHY stands at the helm of the Maersk 120 feet above
the waterline Hes Chief Mate on this ship - 27 tough as a
bouncer but with a Boy Scout face From Seekon Mass

MURPHY
The leader has a knife wound on his
right hand pretty deep Another guy
he was the youngest his foots cut
up - from glass shards

Murphy and 10 OTHER MAERSK CREW-MEMBERS (well meet them
soon) are being debriefed by LT PRICE USN

-as Navy SAILORS take control of this ship An ENSIGN named

REID at the helm Murphy can see the Bainbridge from here
and that tiny orange fiberglass lifeboat This sucks

MURPHY (CONTD)
Is there some rescue planned You
guys gonna get him outta there

LT PRICE
Orders are no offensive measures
until the FBI Negotiator is on sight
and in contact with the pirates

ENSIGN REID
We okay to come about Lieutenant

LT PRICE
Yeah Come about

Reid turns the wheel The giant cargo ship turns Murphy
sighs none of the crew-members look happy Chief Engineer
MIKE PERRY (55 devout Christian) voices it

PERRY
Doesnt feel right leaving him out
there

LT PRICE

Command wants this vessel out of
hostile waters - were escorting you
all the way to Mobassa

The men hate that Murphy studies them then

MURPHY
Can we at least get word to his wife

EXT UNDERHILL VT - RIVER ROAD - PHILLIPS DRIVEWAY - DAY

FOUR NEWSVANS and 15 REPORTERS crowd the snowy driveway and
street outside the home of Richard and Andrea Phillips

see a perfect Vermont pasture blanketed white

Andrea is the one all those reporters want to talk to The
wife Lovely fierce but desperate just now She stares at
an old NAUTICAL BELL that hangs over a clothes-line

Through the patio doors she sees her SISTERS her SISTERS-IN-
LAW NEIGHBORS All here to help But none of them can

On her face fear Sadness She lifts a CELL-PHONE to her
ear hits speed-dial FOUR RINGS then she hears

PHILLIPS (OUTGOING MESSAGE)

INT LIFEBOAT - MOVING - RESUMING (NIGHT)

This lifeboat chugs along airless and fetid

Phillips bound now his face beaten and bruised silently
prays Musi on the bridge watches amused

MUSI
Hey Phillips you turning Catholic
again

(NOTE the bridge is two steps above the lifeboat floor with
nav and radio gear two seats and tiny cockpit windows)

The pirates look strained edgy Elmi nervously works that
three-colored ROPE weaving strands of white orange and red
into a whole Phillips watches with an unspoken dread

PHILLIPS

PHILLIPS

MUSI
Oh yeah This is a training mission

half mile away then chuckles Phillips studies him

MUSI (CONTD)

Najee picks up the three-colored rope consults with Elmi
about it in Somali Clearly it has great meaning to them

The pirates start WHOOPING celebrating as
EXT PHILLIPS HOME - BACK PATIO - RESUMING
Andrea remains alone out here until

AMBER (0S)
Andrea

AMBER Andreas oldest friend stepping on to the patio

ANDREA
Whos been calling
AMBER
Matt Lauer Katie Couric Diane
Sawyer Senator Kennedy Senator
Leahy But we didnt want to
interrupt you

ANDREA
You couldve interrupted me for Matt
Lauer

Amber breathes out a smile then drops a bomb

AMBER
Honey there are two people from
Maersk here

Andrea sees them now through the patio door two CORPORATE
TYPES a man and a woman just got here Standing out like
sore thumbs in a room full of friends and family

She tightens Maybe theyre here to deliver bad news Amber
seems to think so too She leads Andrea into

INT PHILLIPS HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUING

The room is suddenly silent all eyes on the suits ALLISON
McCALL (blonde pretty likes her BlackBerry) and JONATHAN
HENSON (35 solid) They approach Andrea who gulps

ALLISON
Hi Andrea Im Allison McCall This
is Jonathan Henson Were from
Maersk

ANDREA
Okay

Bracing herself Everyone in the room doing the same

ALLISON
Im going to be managing anything
media-related for you Jonathans
going to be liaising with the Defense
Department so youll be getting
steady and real-time information

Okay Shes not here to deliver devastating news Everyone
relaxes A sister-in-law NANCY extends a phone as

NANCY
Um I have the Governor on the phone
He wants to know if theres anything
he can do
ALLISON
Yes He can send over some State
Troopers to move all the reporters
off the road out there Theyre
causing a traffic hazard

Nancy pauses Am I actually supposed to say that

ANDREA
Ill be with him in a second Nancy

Nancy nods relieved Andrea studies Allison wary

ANDREA (CONTD)
I appreciate your being here
Allison But its really not
necessary I know how things go
Maersk got their ship back and all
of their cargo and most of the crew
Thats a pretty good result And
sometimes one man gets sacrificed for
the good of others Thats the sea

ALLISON
Mrs Phillips Maersk is not going to
let anything happen to your husband

ANDREA
I see Then how much are they willing
to spend to save him

WHAM That caught Allison flush Andrea closes her eyes

ANDREA (CONTD)
Richard you have to save yourself

INT LIFEBOAT - NIGHT

A JOLT Phillips is yanked out of a seat by Musi - suddenly
urgently Rage in Musis eyes Somethings infuriated him

MUSI
I want you to know something We were
all fishermen once Other countries
come and overfish our waters dump
all their trash here - no Somali
government to stop them So theres
no more fishing

A few feet away Najee and Elmi pull an ORANGE SURVIVAL SUIT
from a bin and begin to spread it on the floor Odd

PHILLIPS
Whats the survival suit for

MUST
We were fishermen

PHILLIPS
Whats it for

MUSI
If your body touch the floor it
makes the whole boat unclean
Oh Musi loads a 9mm handgun hands it to Bilal The pirates
drop to their knees to PRAY for Allahs blessing Game over
Phillips knows it And he can only utter a single word

PHILLIPS

Super Eight days earlier

outside the window - a snowy pasture on a March morning
Andrea awakens Phillips is the first thing she sees

EXT PORT - SALALAH OMAN - DAY

Phillips emerges from a car in the port of SALALAH OMAN

This place is booming - ships everywhere big ones But all
Phillips can see is the Maersk Alabama ugly and immense

Huge CRANES fill her hold with dumpster-sized CONTAINERS
(She can carry 1092 of them but on this trip shell only be
carrying 400) She bears no flag of nationality

Phillips is instantly in Captain-mode scrutinizing how the

INT MAERSK - BRIDGE - IN PORT - DAY

The maps in here are electronic The radar screens have data
scrolling across them The radios are fed by satellite

Were 120 feet above the waterline looking out at the world
through massive windows A bright trouble-free day But
theres a tension hanging even before weve left port

At the helm are KEN QUINN (2nd Mate) and ATM Raiza (whom
Phillips pissed off on deck) This is hushed

ATM
Im just sayin Coast Guard
advisories say we should be six
hundred miles off-shore

KEN QUINN
You think a pirate trawler couldnt
find a ship six hundred miles out

Murphy ten feet away needs to cut this off So

MURPHY
Uh-oh Were screwed Fellas

The guys turn to see a sailor named DURELL (25 black
fit) who just stepped on to the bridge Durell freezes

-as the guys in here study him like Pledge-Masters
MURPHY (CONTD)

DURELL

MURPHY
Aw Jeez We got an FNG Boys

KEN QUINN

MURPHY

Durell freezes again Really He starts to back out

when ATM and Quinn start laughing big-time which tells
Durell its all a gag He takes it pretty well More laughs

Then Phillips enters - and things tighten The laughs get
choked back Hes the boss And not big on goofing off

Were underway Honey Ill be seeing you in the stars

-as Murphy eyes that bulletin from Naval Intel - about the
surge in piracy off the East Africa coast

EXT INDIAN OCEAN - PIRATE TRAWLER - MOVING - EVENING
Hufans men eat stale crackers while he monitors his radio
Musi is thumbing through a weather-worn ENGLISH DICTIONARY

memorizing words by the glow of a FLASHLIGHT until he
suddenly tosses the book overboard with disdain Splash

BILAL (SOMALI SUBTITLED)
Why you do that All the ships we
board no captain ever speak Somali

MUSI (SOMALI SUBTITLED)
Everybody speaks AK-47 Bilal

EXT MAERSK - MAIN DECK - STERN - AT SEA —- MORNING

A blazing hot day Phillips walks the length of the ship
again - his daily inspection tour - when he sees something

Suspended above B-DECK - right where it should be - is that
fiberglass LIFEBOAT 28 feet long enclosed looks like an
orange submarine sitting on SKIDS at a 45-degree angle

But ten feet below it sitting on overturned buckets are two
members of his crew DEL and DAVE old salts each over 60
and overweight smoking Marlboros

Phillips pauses instantly irritated

PHILLIPS
Enjoying your break Fellas

They eye him without alarm Or chagrin

DEL
Sorry Cap I got a slipped disc
PHILLIPS
Oh
(at Dave )

Howre your discs

(Dave shrugs)
Get to work Christ Arent you guys
supposed to be cleaning the lifeboat
And theres no smoking on deck

Del and Dave put their cigs out and rise grabbing a hose

PHILLIPS (CONTD)
No Not a hose Get up in a harness
and soogee it with a Turks Head

DEL
Really

PHILLIPS
Yep Hosin it aint the same thing

They eye the lifeboat suspended above them Hanging up there
in a harness sounds like a hassle Phillips turns to go

DAVE

Murphy and Ken Quinn eating Phillips enters irritated

ee HF

PHILLIPS
Got some confused sailors on board
Shane They seem to think my names

MURPHY
You need me to tune somebody up Cap

Phillips is about to reply when he sees ANOTHER BULLETIN on
the table Worldwide Threats to Shipping

its sitting in front of Ken Quinn Clearly he and Murphy
have been discussing it 23 pirate attacks reported off of
East Africa in a single week

Now Phillips is really irritated - because a bulletin like
this should NOT be loose on the ship He grabs it

PHILLIPS
No I want you to show our crew a
Goddamn map

He gestures to a MAP on the wall

PHILLIPS (CONTD)
Heres Somalia Heres Mombasa
Heres Djibouti Heres us Coast
Guard advisories say we should be six
hundred miles off-shore Great
except you cant be six hundred miles
away from Somalia if youre going to
Mombasa because Mombasa is sixty
miles from the Somali border You can
go a thousand miles straight out but
you still gotta come back into range
because thats our destination And
by the way these guysve hit ships
twelve-hundred miles off shore just
like theyve hit ships that are at
anchor in port These are the waters
were sailing Okay

Murphy nods Quinn too Phillips seems calmer now

GENERAL ALARM which sounds throughout the ship LOUD

PHILLIPS

pulls out four big CANTALOUPES and some JUICE-BOXES Hands
them to Bilal who has the AK in his hands

They arent gonna come out if youre
armed

Its a respect thing Theyre

to Najee handing off the AK and mumbling instructions

pipes in Excuse me But I think Im
