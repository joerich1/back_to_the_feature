NOTE
What you are about to see is not found footage
The events you are about to watch are not pre-recorded
They are going to happen --
RIGHT NOW
A BLACK SCREEN
A voice speaks to us with a calm menace

VOICE
Are you watching

A DIM SQAURE appears in the upper left corner of the screen
A moment passes the square illuminates and we realize --
Were watching a live video feed of an empty room

VOICE
Good

We cant make much of the image but we can see something
moving in the dim space

VOICE
Look very closely

A TEENAGE GIRL In her bedroom Still and alone Video
chatting at her desk She has no idea were watching her

PHHRPT -- A new feed appears next to the one weve been
viewing

A TEENAGE BOY Alone in his room Playing a video game
Oblivious to the fact that hes being observed

PHHRPT -- now another feed

A MAN and WOMAN Watching television in the family room
Routine Silent Unaware

PHHRPT -- PHHRPT -- PHHRPT -- Square after square appear on

the screen Room after room Like a chessboard And we

realize something -- theyre all coming from the same home
VOICE

If you watch I will give you what
you came here for

The POVs are now switching quickly -- multiple angles -- as
the Voice continues to speak
VOICE
I want you to watch
KITCHEN -- BEDROOM -- BATHROOM -- BASEMENT -- ATTIC
There are cameras everywhere

The footage were seeing is slick controlled and
professional

Set up by someone who knows their craft

VOICE
Because this is just the beginning
PHHRPT -- The feeds disappear and the screen goes black
Then -- slowly -- a single feed fills the screen

THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE

Surrounded by nature Isolated and still Were now
watching the home from a new angle The feeling from this
altered view is frenetic Unstable Then we realize --
OUR POV IS COMING FROM A CAMERA ATTACHED TO A MOVING PERSON

The voice continues

VOICE
My intention is not to create fear

Then a SOUND BREATHING -- picked up by the cameras
microphone -- as our view stalks closer and closer to the
home

VOICE
It is to release it

The voice stops

Our POV CAM moves closer to the kitchen window that frames
the family inside -- all together now

THE KITCHEN

There are four people in the kitchen

THE GIRL Must be 17 Washing dishes and hating it Shes
letting everyone know how miserable she is without saying a

word Shes attractive -- but she does the best she can to
hide it

THE BOY Probably 14 Latino Drying dishes and doing a
terrible job at it Hes a sweet-looking kid who is careful
enough to place the plates where theyre supposed to go but
careless enough to dry his hands on his T-shirt

THE FATHER In his 40s Reviewing his bills and sentencing
them to life or death with the rip of an envelope Hes a
man fighting the fatigue of a long day at work but that
doesnt hide his strength or his looks it just softens it

THE WIFE Late 20s Latina Cleaning the kitchen table
around her husbands mess Shes a woman young enough to
make you stop and wonder about her husband but captivating
enough to make you forgive him Her face is the brightest
spot in the room

As they go about their routine the sound and images are raw
and real Were seeing them from different angles and were
hearing them from different places The effect is startling
Were not watching them

WERE SPYING ON THEM
The silence is broken by the girls voice

THE GIRL
Why wont you just let me leave

FATHER
Because youre being punished You
can survive one night on your own
without your boyfriend

JAMIE
Not in this house
FATHER
Jamie
JAMIE
(imitating him)
Dad
THE WIFE
Jamie
JAMIE
(cold)
Olivia

Jamies response hangs in the air with a venom that only a
teenager can deliver
OLIVIA
Adam why dont you just let her
go I can take over for her

ADAM
She can give up a Friday night to
say goodbye to her uncle before he
leaves town

JAMIE
He didnt even show up for dinner

ADAM
Our discussion about this already
ended Youre not going out
tonight

Jamie delivers an icy stare her fathers way
to the KITCHEN PHONE to make a call

A puzzled look comes over her face

Adam ignores her

not

JAMIE
Somethings wrong The line isnt
working

JAMIE
Diego did you do something to the
phone

The boy responds

A beat

DIEGO
I never use that phone

JAMIE
Well something is wrong I cant
make a call --

ADAM
I cancelled the land line

JAMIE
Why did you do that

ADAM
Because Im changing our cell phone
plan and we dont need to pay extra
for the land line

She walks over

Olivia doesnt know whether to speak or
JAMIE
(suspicious)
What do you mean youre changing
our plan

Adam is careful with his response

ADAM
I switched us to a family plan

This comment changes the tone in the room and Adam can see it

in Jamies reaction
ADAM
It means youre getting a new
phone I thought youd be happy
Diego youre getting one too

DIEGO
Boom BOOM

Adam turns to his daughter
ADAM
Youve been asking for a new phone
for months Why arent you
excited

Jamie thinks about her response before she delivers
it comes out of her mouth

JAMIE
Because theyre not my family

If Jamie wanted a reaction she certainly gets one
Olivia looks terribly hurt
Diego looks totally uncomfortable

And Adam looks ready to burst

His daughter doesnt like her new step-family and shes

willing to say it to their face

Our view switches to

OUTSIDE FROM THE TREES

it

Then

where were watching the modest home from a new angle

lurking across the street

WATCHING FROM THE POV-CAMERA
The feeling is unnerving

A SOUND emerges from the distance A car is approaching A
moment passes and the lawn is bathed in headlights

OUR POV TURNS TO THE SOUND and observes a PICK-UP TRUCK
driving toward the house

OUR VIEW MOVES -- slipping back behind a nearby tree and
throwing everything into darkness Then we peer out from the
oak to steal a view of the vehicle now parking in front of
the home

Our POV lingers Waiting A predator watching for prey

The headlights go dark leaving the car illuminated by the
lone street lamp

SOMEONE emerges from the truck

Hes scratching his thick beard with one arm and cradling a
brown bag under the other We cant see much in the darkness
but we can see that this is a man built like a Redwood in
carpenters overalls He takes out a KEYCHAIN tethered to
his belt loop and heads up to the front door

From the distance we watch as he fiddles with his keys and
enters the home Greeted by Olivia and Diego We can just
make out Diegos voice from afar

DIEGO
Matt

Uncle Matt enters the house and Olivia closes the front door
behind him

Silence takes over the night The only sounds that remain
are the deep hoarse BREATHING being picked up by the POV
CAMERAS MICROPHONE

Our view moves closer

TO THE FRONT WINDOW

Â» where we can just make out a sliver of whats happening
through the curtains

We observe for a moment Then the POV-CAMERA turns and looks
toward the street

We notice something we couldnt see from the other angle of
the road

Theres a second car parked in the distance -- a WINDOWLESS
VAN -- and we can just make out the outline of a FIGURE
inside -- dark and foreboding

A moment passes The headlights flash -- one-two -- one-two
A signal
The coast is clear

The POV-CAMERA turns away from the window and moves towards
Matts truck -- quickly -- heading past the hatch where we

catch a glimpse of empty bags and toolboxes -- ending up at
the other side of the car

The POV-CAMERA looks up for a moment to check on the house
Finds it silent and still Then our view turns back to the
car and moves carefully -- slowly -- and slides under the
vehicle

Our POV searches the undercarriage Looking for something
We move past the drive-train the shock absorbers the
gliding mechanism Then our POV finds it

A SINGLE PIPE

A pair of hands enter our POV -- one grabs the pipe the
other clutches a pair of pliers The microphone picks up
heavy breathing now as the hands use the pliers to SNAP the

pipe

We watch as a fluid spews onto the street Gallon after
gallon

THE FAMILY ROOM

Were back in the house now OBSERVING FROM AN OVERHEAD ANGLE
in the empty family room Its a strange feeling to watch
this unoccupied space as we barely pick up the SOUNDS of the
family off in the front room

FLOORBOARDS CREEK
Matt rushes into view with his large bag under his arm
MATT
Diego open the tank We have to
put these in right away
Diego is right behind Matt our angle switching now as they

approach the illuminated centerpiece of the room a HEXAGONAL
FREESTANDING AQUARIUM
The teenager snaps open the lid of the tank

Inside two pairs of white-orange OSCAR FISH glide through
the water tails flowing like a veil Like wraiths

The rest of the family enters the room now including a
reluctant Jamie who is not enthused

Matt reaches into the bag under his arms and pulls out a
plastic container filled with TINY FISH

MATT
Know what these are Theyre feeder
fish

DIEGO
New fish

MATT
No Theyre fish for the other
fish to eat

DIEGO
The other fish are going to eat
them

MATT

And were gonna watch
Matt pours the little fish into the tank

MATT
You guys have to see this Come
on

Adam and Olivia relent and gather around the tank Jamie
lingers behind posturing so that everyone knows shes not
amused

OLIVIA
Matty we only feed them pellets

MATT
Not tonight

We see the tank now Inside the Oscars are working
themselves into a frenzy

DIEGO
Does it take long
MATT
The longer it takes the more
exciting it is when it finally
happens

Theres an energy that changes in the tank and the family is
mesmerized by it Even Jamie cant help but watch

JAMIE
This is perverse Youre not
feeding the fish youre watching
them get killed

MATT
Lighten up Jamie its just for
fun

Hunger turns into savage instinct now as the hefty Oscar fish
CHASE the skittering feeders

DIEGO
This is awesome

Behind the fish tank is another large window that looks out
into the back yard of the house The tall panes of glass
loom over the family

It is a picture frame with darkness as its canvas

Our angle switches to the

BACKYARD

- where were now watching the family FROM THE POV-CAMERA
A NOISE is picked up by the CAMERAS MIC

Breathing Heavy and forceful

Our POV moves toward the window as the family can be seen
inside amused by the thrill of whats happening in the fish
tank

Our POV moves even closer now -- the BREATHING growing louder
-- muting all the other noises of the night

INSIDE THE FAMILY ROOM

Were watching the family from a new angle inside the home
Slowly something becomes apparent outside the window

ITS THE OUTLINE OF A NIGHTMARE

A brutal silhouette Just watching them

We cant make it out completely but theres a part of the
figures appearance that doesnt seem right Its difficult
to see but its clear that SOMETHING IS DRAPED OVER HIS
HEAD Its not a hood And its not a mask ITS SOMETHING
ELSE

Before we get a decent look the figure disappears back into
the darkness of the night

Waiting

Diego cries out toward the aquarium

DIEGO
Wow Look at them go

What is briefly an amusing spectacle quickly becomes dark and
disturbing Primal carnage consumes the tank The Oscars
twist and turn with sharp and violent movements swallowing
the feeders whole

The smile vanishes from Diegos face as everyone in the room
goes silent

Jamie has had enough
JAMIE

Theres something wrong with you

people
THE KITCHEN
Were watching overhead from the kitchen as Jamie makes her
way through the house MUFFLED VOICES from the Family Room
can still be heard
FRONT HALL
A new angle of Jamie heading out of the kitchen and towards
the steps that lead upstairs

ABOVE THE STAIRS

Looking down on Jamie as she makes her way to the second
floor of the home

SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

Another angle now watching Jamie step across her hard wood
floor toward a door at the end of the hallway

We watch as she enters her room and closes the door behind
her sealing herself off from the rest of the house

But not from our view

JAMIES ROOM
Were inside now watching from MULTIPLE ANGLES

Theres a desk buried under clutter a bed buried under
clothing and walls buried under cliches

Jamie closes the shades opens her laptop and we catch a
glimpse of her desktop picture

It is an OLD PHOTO

In it we see a different Jamie Bright and beaming She
and her father are embracing a WOMAN who who has just
finished a marathon The woman is wearing a NEON PINK
WINDBREAKER with a MARATHON BIB NUMBER pinned on the front
She is the spitting image of the young Jamie

It must be her MOTHER

The moment passes and in an instant shes on Facebook
messaging away

THE FAMILY ROOM
Were back in the family room looking at it from a NEW ANGLE
We can see Diego alone now stuffing his HOCKEY EQUIPMENT

into a sports bag on the floor

DIEGO
Anyone see my sticks

Behind him we can see the kitchen framed from the doorway in
the family room
THE KITCHEN

Â» and we can see the family room framed from the doorway
in the kitchen

Olivia and Adam are standing at the counter speaking to Matt
We pick them up in mid-conversation

OLIVIA
-- not saying that I love Jamie
Im saying that I made a conscious
choice to cease being responsible
for her actions

ADAM
You arent responsible for her
actions Shes seventeen

OLIVIA
Look if she started a fire on the
living room floor Id intervene
But if shes out with her boyfriend
and doesnt come home by midnight
I ignore it Adam can deal with
it

ADAM
I donât like how she treats Diego

OLIVIA
Diegos tougher than he looks Im
sure hes fine

MATT
When its coming from you guys
Jamie hears what she wants to

Matt grabs the bag he brought into the house

MATT
Let her hear it from someone else

ADAM
Its just a phase Matt She needs
to go through it on her own

MATT
Shes been through a lot on her own
already

Matt exits the room leaving Olivia and Adam behind When
they look up they see Diego framed in the doorway clutching
his GOALIE MASK Hes staring at them

DIEGO
You know I can hear you talking
about me in there right

FRONT HALL

Overhead as Matt heads out of the kitchen and onto the
stairs

ABOVE THE STAIRS

Looking down on Matt as he makes his way up the staircase

SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

Matt stepping onto the hard wood floor and heading to Jamies
room He pauses before he knocks on her door

JAMIES ROOM

Jamie is in the midst of a video chat with a BOY who must be

her boyfriend We cant quite make out where he is but its
noisy and hes surrounded by other kids his age

JAMIE
-- because Im worried about
something

BOY
What

JAMIE
Josh just call me I need to talk
to you

Its clear from his face that hed rather be anywhere else
but talking to Jamie

JOSH
You are talking to me Thats what
were doing now Were talking

JAMIE
I dont want to discuss it in front
of everyone

JOSH
Just say what you want to say
Jaime Youre always so precious

Theres a knock at the door

JAMIE
I have to go

In an instant she has shut her computer lid

Jamie creaks open her door and is greeted by her bearded
uncle

MATT
Busy

Jamie doesnt need to say it Its written all over her
face Why are you up here bothering me

MATT
Come on Jam Let me in I come
bearing gifts

Jamie relents and allows Matt into her fortress of solitude
He sits on the bed

MATT
Im not much for this kinda stuff
but I wanted to get you something
before you head off to school in
the fall

JAMIE
Matt you dont--

MATT
Look I know you can take care of
yourself But there are bad people
out there And I want you to be
safe So I got you something

Matt reaches into the bag Hands her a CURVED BLACK DEVICE

JAMIE
What is it

MATT
I researched this ok Theres all
kinds of bullshit Peppery sprays
Personal alarms Rape whistles
Theyre all basically scams that
try to make money off of fear

Matt points at the device

MATT
This -- is a Taser As far as Im
concerned theres only one way to
stop aggressors and assholes and
thats with 150000 volts Enough
to make em hit the floor and soil
their drawers

(MORE)

MATT (CONTD)
(then)
Aim for the dick For real Shoot
the prick -- in the prick

As Matt hands the device over to Jamie she recoils

JAMIE
Matt I dont need this
MATT
I always carry something to protect

myself

Matt points to a FOLDING KNIFE clipped onto his pocket
Jamie doesnt look pleased

MATT
Its not to make you feel better
Jamie Its to make me feel
better Take it

Matt reaches out takes hold of Jamies hand and places the
weapon in her palm Its a rare moment of intimacy for Jamie
and she succumbs

JAMIE
Matt I dont know I might not
be going

Matt is confused This wasnt the response he was expecting

MATT
The hell you talking about

JAMIE
Sometimes things dont work
out

MATT

Youve got your whole future ahead
of you and you want to spend it
here working at Starbucks Are
you serious

The look on her face Stressed Tense Troubled Theres
a burden shes carrying and in this moment its overwhelming
her

MATT
Is it about your Dad You guys
used to be so close You were best
friends

JAMIE
Matt

MATT
What

JAMIE

I dont Want To talk about it
Matt decides to let it go He embraces his niece

MATT
You need to know this At your
age theres no boy thats worth
getting worked up about

Jamie fights back a smile It makes Matt happy
MATT

And Jamie Wherever you end up in

the fall Whatever you end up

doing They are your family now

Make amends before you leave this

house
Matt releases her and exits the room Jamie closes the door
and seals the room off from the world Then she returns to
her chair and drops the taser on her desk
She becomes lost in thought Moments pass Then she moves
Jamie stands up and YANKS OPEN HER DESK DRAWER Her face
studies AN UNSEEN OBJECT inside Then her hands reach in to
pull it out
Its a PLASTIC GROCERY BAG

She opens it and examines the contents Her face starts to
change Whatever is inside weighs deeply on her

SOMETHING TROUBLING
But we cant see what it is

Our view switches to

THE STAIRS

Â» where we watch as Matt makes his way from upstairs down
to a part of the house we havent fully seen yet Our angle
switches again to

THE FRONT ROOM
- where Matt descends from the MAIN STAIRCASE

This room contains the FRONT ENTRANCE to the home Theres a
SEATING AREA on the right where Adam and Olivia are reading
on a couch by the fireplace

Adam looks up at his brother and sees something in his eyes

ADAM
What

Matt speaks from the heart

MATT
Dont give up on her

Adam takes this in and wrestles with it for a moment Then
he gets up off the couch and embraces his brother

ADAM
Im going to miss you Matty

Matt pulls away fighting back his own emotion

MATT
Gimme a chance to at least thank
you proper For letting me stay
here You know while I was
getting back on my feet again

Matt reaches into his pocket and takes out a SMALL JEWELRY
BOX He hands it to his brother

ADAM
Come on you prick you dont owe us
anything

Adam opens the jewelry box and is startled by what he sees

ADAM
Matty You prick You prick

The STOMPING OF TEENAGE FEET fills the room and Diego bounds
inside racing over to Adam

DIEGO
What is it

He watches as his his step-father pulls an object out of the
Jewelry box It is a SILVER ROUNDED RECTANGLE a little
bigger than a matchbox

ADAM
Do you know what this is

Diego cant quite make it out Then grabs it and realizes

DIEGO
A lighter

ADAM
Be careful with that Its not any
lighter Its a Ronson comet
(beat)
He used to use one to light his

pipe

DIEGO
Who did

ADAM
Our dad
(to Matt)
Wow Its just like Pops

Matt gives his brother a knowing look Its not just like
their fathers lighter

It is their fathers lighter

ADAM
No

Adam grabs the lighter from Diegos hands and examines it
As he does he mutters in awe

ADAM
Where did you find this

MATT
Got it from Aunt June In three
pieces Had to locate a
replacement valve and the filler
screw Even refilled the butane
(then)
Try it It works

Diego glances up at Olivia and Adam and the look on his face
speaks for him Can I try it

Adam hands Diego the device and the teenager is eager to
depress the striker After two or three tries a MAJESTIC
GOLDEN FLAME emerges from the flint

DIEGO
Sweet

Adam puts his arm around his step-son and his wife
ADAM
(to Matt)
Come here you prick
Matt grins and Adam wraps the whole family in his arms
Well Not the whole family There is one member of the
family missing
THE STAIRS
From this angle we see Jamie has been OBSERVING THROUGH THE
BANNISTER from the stairwell Unseen As the family

embraces

She lingers for a moment and slips back up the stairs out of
our view Her presence noticed only by us

THE FRONT ROOM
Adam takes the lighter from Diego

ADAM
I dont want you using this Its
dangerous You got me

DIEGO
Got you

Adam places the lighter back into the jewelry box and slides
it into a nearby drawer

ADAM
It stays there

Diego nods

OLIVIA
Time for bed

Diego heads up the stairs but before he does his mother
stops him

OLIVIA
Diego Basura

Diego reacts as you would expect But one look from his
mother and there is no arguing The boy heads back down the
stairs and walks into the kitchen

OUTSIDE THE GARAGE

Angular SHADOWS are being cast onto the driveway from the
surrounding pine trees After a brief moment A MOTION
SENSOR LIGHT illuminates the night as Diego emerges from the
house and drags a GREEN PLASTIC GARBAGE CAN carelessly toward
the street

It is only seconds before he disappears from our view

Soon after a LONG DARK SHADOW slowly spills across the
pavement

THE DRIVEWAY

Diego rolls the heavy container away from his home to the
street Slowly A NIGHTMARISH SILHOUETTE materializes behind
him THE FIGURE

A moment passes and it disappears into the trees

FROM THE TREES

POV-CAMERA Our view peers out from behind a tree trunk and
focuses on Diego in the distance We watch as the boys head
turns and is drawn to something

Our POV turns and locks in on what hes seeing

ITS THE VAN

Diego has noticed it Our view changes to

INSIDE THE VAN

where were now peering out the windshield Our angle
askew Slanted Distressed And we realize

WERE WATCHING FROM A SECOND POV-CAMERA A SECOND PERSON

This POV has a very different energy The cameras mic picks
up BREATHING that is JITTERY AND AGITATED Like a rabid
animal

A KNIT GLOVED HAND reaches into view and adjusts the camera
fixing our angle more clearly on the street outside the van
And for a brief moment WE CATCH A SLIGHT REFLECTION IN THE
REARVIEW MIRROR

Its quick And its difficult to register But we see it

SOMETHING ON THE FIGURES HEAD

Its not a HAT or a CAP Its something else

Before we can get a clear look at it the POV-CAMERA shifts
and our glimpse of the reflection disappears Our view
switches to

THE DRIVEWAY

where Diego is straining to see if theres a someone in
that van

But there doesnt appear to be

The teenager heads back inside

We linger on the street waiting to see if any of the figures
emerge from the darkness None do

THE KITCHEN

Our angle is trained on Adam who is PLACING HIS CELL PHONE IN
A CHARGER BY THE DOOR

Diego enters and says good-night We follow the boy out of
the kitchen and into
THE FRONT HALL

- where he bounds up the stairs onto the

SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

Â»-- and rushes over to

DIEGOS BEDROOM
and arrives inside

Its a room decorated with the Y chromosome in mind Posters
of sports stars rock musicians and video games line the
wall Theres a hand-me-down television stuck in the corner
with an X-box next to it

Diego throws his HEADSET is over his ear and hes picks up
where he left off on his first person shooter He SHOUTS
COMMANDS over his mic to the other gamers online In his own
little world

The bedtime routine has begun in the home

SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

Olivia heads to a door on the second floor and enters the

MASTER BEDROOM

Its an elegant room with mid-century modern aesthetic and a
large window that looks out onto the backyard

She heads over to her closet and takes out her nightgown

THE KITCHEN

Adam is embracing his brother and saying goodnight They
separate and Matt makes his way to a door that leads to
THE BASEMENT STAIRWAY

He descends down creaking wooden steps into

THE BASEMENT

which has been converted into a makeshift guest room
There are remnants of the familys earlier years throughout
the space AN OLD DIVING MASK AND REGULATOR FADED
PHOTOGRAPHS Even a POOL TABLE in the corner gathering
dust

Matt drops his wallet and keys on the bed Takes this moment
to walk over to the SMALL WINDOW WELL and crack it open to
let off some steam

HE SMOKES A JOINT

SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

As Adam makes his way to the master bedroom He stops for a
moment to look at his home and notices that all he sees are
CLOSED DOORS A family each in their own universe

Adam sighs and heads to the

SECOND FLOOR BATHROOM

- where he makes his way to the toilet Unzips Takes a
piss

Our angle lingers on him

MASTER BEDROOM

Olivia is now taking off her clothes to change into her
nightgown

AFTER A MOMENT SHE IS IN HER UNDERWEAR
She smooths moisturizing lotion across her legs arms then
finally her face When shes done she exhales deeply

releasing the tension from the day Her private zen

She slips on her nightgown

SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY
Adam exits the second floor bathroom and shouts

ADAM
Olivia Bathrooms free

He moves to Diegos door and opens it a crack

DIEGOS BEDROOM
Adam can be seen peering into the room
ADAM
Five more minutes then the game
goes off and time to wash up
SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY
As Adam moves to Jamies room and knocks on her door

ADAM
Hey Jam

A moment passes

JAMIE (0S)
Yeah

Adam stands in front of the closed door and isnt exactly
sure what to say Finally he manages to speak to his
daughter
ADAM

Just wanted to see if youre doing

okay
JAMIES ROOM
Shes in front of her computer turned toward her closed
door This comment softens Jamie a bit and she responds

earnestly

JAMIE
Im okay Dad
SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY
Her father waits a moment to see if shell appear When she
doesnt he places his hand on the doorframe Its clear he
wants to say something to her To connect in some way
But he cant

Instead he simply says--

ADAM
All right

Theres no response

Adam walks to his bedroom passing by the sounds of SHOUTING
and EXPLOSIONS that are sounding from behind Diegos door
THE DRIVEWAY

Our view switches to the POV-CAMERA From this angle we can
see the KITCHEN WINDOW and the ILLUMINATED BATHROOM above it

JITTERY BREATHING is picked up by the cameras mic

This is the second POV-CAMERA now moving outside the home

Our view SLOWLY TURNS away from observing the side of the
house to the BACK of the driveway

Parked there is the family car a weathered MID-SIZED SEDAN

The POV-CAMERA MOVES TOWARD IT

Our view silently approaches the family vehicle and ducks
down by the REAR WHEEL Then something enters our view
A LARGE HUNTING KNIFE
Clutched by a SPINDLY HAND
The RAZOR-EDGED steel is slid into the rubber tire with
TERRIFYING EASE When it is removed the tire bleeds air

with a sharp HISS

The POV turns back up toward the illuminated window checking
to see if anyone is watching

No one is

SECOND FLOOR BATHROOM

Were now watching Olivia examine herself in the mirror
Shes staring right at us Her make-up has been removed but
the appeal of her natural beauty is hard to deny

She reaches into a drawer and glides a stick of lip-balm
along her lips

SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

Olivia exits and shouts to the the closed doors

OLIVIA
Im done in here

She heads over to Jamies door and knocks

JAMIES ROOM
Jamie doesnt want to be interrupted

JAMIE
What do you want

OLIVIA (0S)
Im done in the bathroom Jamie

JAMIE
I heard you
SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

Olivia gets the message She heads back into her room

JAMIES ROOM
Jamie shuts her computer screen Glances down at her desk
SHE GRABS THE PLASTIC BAG FROM HER DRAWER

Then stands and hides it under her shirt

SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

As Jamie rushes from her door into the

SECOND FLOOR BATHROOM

where she shuts the door behind her and locks it from
the inside

Jamie places the plastic bag onto the NEARBY HAMPER

Then she makes her way to the sink and stares at herself in
the mirror She becomes lost in thought

THE BASEMENT

Matt is taking clothing from a closet and placing it into a
suitcase Hes packing up to leave

DIEGOS ROOM

Diego is chatting to friends over his X-Box headphones while
fiddling with a hockey stick

DIEGO
invite her and her friends to
watch us practice Or to a game

Someone in his headset says something that makes Diego
chuckle

DIEGO
Ha Thats a private invitation
Her friends dont get to watch
that
(then)
Shit Im gonna have to piss ina
minute here

SECOND FLOOR BATHROOM

Jamie moves to the shower turns it on and lets the noise
provide a sense of security in this small room

She moves -- quick and purposeful -- takes out the plastic
bag and finally removes the contents from inside

ITS A PREGNANCY TEST

Before she can think shes opening the box -- scanning the
instructions -- removing the test stick from the foil
wrapper

Jamie moves over to the toilet -- fighting any doubt or
regret -- moving fast

She aims the device toward her crotch We dont see the
details but we get a sense of whats happening on her face
As she breathes In -- out -- in -- out Finally we hear
it

She pees on the test Finishes Flushes the toilet Pulls

out the directions to confirm

JAMIE
(reading)
Three minutes

And she waits Aching moments pass They feel like an
eternity Until theres a KNOCK AT THE DOOR

DIEGO (0S)
Jamie I have to go to the
bathroom are you done

JAMIE
Give me a minute

More moments pass She looks at the device

JAMIE
(to herself)
Come on
Another knock
DIEGO (0OS)

Jaime I have to go Im going to
pee my pants

Concern creeps over Jamies face She snaps at her step-
brother

JAMIE
Diego whats your problem I said
hold on
The knocks continue Loud and demanding

DIEGO (0S)
Jamie please

She grabs the pregnancy test and throws it into the garbage
Unrolls sheets of toilet paper and tosses it into the
cannister to cover the evidence
More knocks at the door This time her step-mother
OLIVIA (0S)
Jaime whats going on in there

Diego has to go to the bathroom

JAMIE
Im coming Jesus

Jamie takes one more look at the garbage to make sure there
is no suspicious evidence Then she opens the door and exits
the room

SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

Diego rushes into the bathroom slamming the door shut behind
him Jamie exits past her step-mother

JAMIE
He didnt have to call in the
cavalry

Jamie disappears into her room

JAMIES ROOM

She locks the door behind her and grabs her cell phone
Hesitates Then dials a number It rings Rings Rings
Then --

We pick up the sound of a boyâs voice Joshâs voicemail

Jamie snaps the phone shut and crashes onto her bed

JAMIE
Asshole

SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

Olivia places her ear on the door to her step-daughters room
and strains to hear whats going on But the NOISES from the
X-box in Diegos room are too loud to make anything out

Diego exits the bathroom and heads back to his room She
turns to her son confused about his very brief bathroom
visit

OLIVIA

Did you even brush your teeth
DIEGO

I did
OLIVIA

All of them
But Diego is already in his room

Olivia reaches for the HALLWAY LIGHT SWITCH

OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

Were looking at the home from a POV-CAMERA across the
street The hallway light goes dark through the bathroom
window and with it most of the house

Our POV turns to see A SHAPE moving toward us from down the
street

A pair of arms enter our view and wave to it
SIGNALING
Our POV turns back to the house

It is peaceful Silent

MASTER BEDROOM

Olivia slides into bed with her husband She joins him in
reading a book before they go to sleep

THE BASEMENT

Matt is doing a final check to see if he missed anything

After a sweep of the room he reaches for the LAND LINE PHONE
on bedside table

But when he picks it up hes greeted with silence Matt
depresses the switchhook a couple of times and soon realizes
the phone isnt working He gazes around the room for a
moment then checks his pockets Nothing Where is his cell
phone He must have left it in the car

Matt grabs his keys from his nightstand The exhausted man
heads upstairs

OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

Were right at the edge of the street looking at the house
from the POV-CAMERA The microphone is picking up sounds of
heavy breathing which grow louder and louder with every
passing moment

Then the front door opens

And the breathing goes silent

The POV-CAMERA turns Moves to the street Slips down
behind Matts truck to hide

After a moment our view moves and spies through the window
of the truck to get a look at the front door of the house

We see that Matt has emerged and is quietly closing the door
shut

Our angle switches to the

STREET TO THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE
Â» where were now watching from THE SECOND POV-CAMERA
Hiding behind a tree next to the street lamp

We catch sounds from the cameras mic BREATHING Different
in tone from the other camera Higher pitch Wheezing

And an urgency
It goes silent

The POV moves backward Away from Matts view Deeper into
the night

Our angle switches again to

OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

where were now watch from THE FIRST POV-CAMERA
Matt is walking toward his truck Right towards us
Our POV slides down below the window Hides Angle slowly
gliding up and down Matching the rhythm of hushed breathing
being picked up by cameras the microphone

Waiting for Matt to approach

Footsteps grow louder Keys jingle together as they draw
near

Matt appears into our POV Stops cold

His face becomes startled and frightened His hand reaches
for the folding knife on his hip

Our angle switches to

ABOVE THE HOUSE

where were perched on the roof of the house looking
down on the front lawn and street below

Matt stands at his car staring down at the figure we cannot
see He is speaking or at least trying to but from our
distance we cant hear anything hes saying

The lone street lamp flickers casting a sliver of light onto
Matt and his truck But there is something lurking in the
darkness

The second figure emerges from behind the street lamp

We cant quite make them out but we can see something in
their hand Its raised into the air clutching a violent
object

THE HUNTING KNIFE

What happens next is sudden and brutal

Matt is hoisted into the air by the first figure Flailing

as he goes Desperately -- unsuccessfully -- trying to grasp
the weapon on his hip

ON THE STREET

Our angle switches to the POV-CAMERA Were now RUSHING
towards Matt HUNTING KNIFE CLUTCHED INTO VIEW as the
microphone picks up deep menacing breaths as we go

Its a startling and violent feeling

WERE SEEING WHAT THE KILLER SEES WEAPON IN HAND AS WE HEAD
TOWARD THEIR VICTIM

Matt struggles to break free as we rush toward him

And as soon as were about to reach him our angle switches
to

DIEGOS ROOM

where a video game blade comes slashing down on a
digital victim

Diego shouts into his headset

DIEGO
Woo Slashed Owned again Nice

Theres audio in his earpiece and he laughs in response
DIEGO

Im not the one out in the open
noob

MASTER BEDROOM

Adam and Olivia read in silence The only violence theyre
aware of is coming from the sounds inside Diegos room

ADAM
Hes got two minutes before I go in
there

Olivia smiles at her husband

OLIVIA
Somebodys cranky

ADAM
Somebodyâs tired

Olivia reaches her hand under Adams shirt and strokes his
chest

OLIVIA
You do realize that if we can hear
them they cant hear us

OUTSIDE THE HOME

Our angle changes and were watching from the POV-CAMERA
outside

The HUNTING KNIFE is lifted into our view covered ina
dripping layer of CRIMSON THE BLACK KNIT GLOVE enters frame
and WIPES THE WEAPON CLEAN

There is a brief instant where we catch a REFLECTION OF THE
FIGURE to whom our POV-CAMERA is attached Its difficult to
comprehend Something about the FIGURES FACE Something
BIZARRE

But before we can fully see the image OUR POV TURNS to the
home

The LIGHT GOES OUT in the master bedroom

MASTER BEDROOM

Moonlight is the only source of light in the room BODIES
move under the sheets After a moment of silence we can
hear NOISES coming from Diego and Jamie in the hallway

Adams head pops out from under the covers

ADAM
You have to be kidding me

OLIVIA
Get back under here

A moment passes and we can hear Diego shouting to his
friends

DIEGO (0S)
Whoa Nice

Adam sits up in bed

ADAM
I cant do this

OLIVIA
Just ignore it

Adam waits a moment for the sounds quiet down

Moments pass

It happens again this time the MUFFLED SOUNDS from Jamies
video chat

Adam bolts up and out of bed He rushes to his door yanks
it open and storms into the
SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY
- where he makes an announcement
ADAM
Thats it Its bed time thats
it

He heads over to Diegos room and opens his door startling
the boy

ADAM
Diego game off Now

Diego speaks into his headset

DIEGO
Hey I have to go

Adam is not amused as Diego tries to end his game

ADAM
Unplug it From the wall Now

Diego sours at this idea He begrudgingly unplugs the xbox

ADAM
Hand it to me

Diego fights off his frustration Hands the box to his step-
father

DIEGO
Sorry we were almost --

Adam doesnt want to hear it

ADAM
Door open Lights out

He walks over to Jamies room as SOUNDS from the VIDEO CHAT
grow louder and with them JAMIES VOICE

Adam reaches for the doorknob and tries to spin it But to
no avail Its locked
He bangs on the door

ADAM
Jamie

The sounds from the chat GO SILENT Then --

JAMIE (0S)
I turned it down

ADAM
Open the door

Moments pass and THE DOOR OPENS

ADAM
Do you think youre the only one in
this house

JAMIE
I was just talking

ADAM
I understand that itâs Friday night
Jamie but we need to get some
sleep

Jamies only response is silence

ADAM
I want your phone and your
computer

JAMIE

Dad Ill be quiet

Adam responds with his own silence

After seeing that her father is not backing down Jamies

face turns from defiance to ANGER

She scowls and walks over to COMPUTER Grabs it along with

the CELL PHONE on her desk Glares at her father as she

hands over her devices

Its as if hes taken her soul

ADAM
I just need you to be quiet guys
(to Diego)

You hear me Diego

DIEGO (0S)
Okay

Clutching an ARMFUL OF EQUIPMENT Adam heads to the stairs
and makes his way to the first floor

THE KITCHEN

Were watching an empty kitchen illuminated by a SOFT LIGHT
above the stove Soon we can hear the CREAKING OF HARDWOOD
STAIRS outside the room

Moments pass and Adam enters placing the equipment onto the
kitchen table THE X-BOX JAMIES COMPUTER HER CELL
PHONE

ALL THE CHILDRENS CONNECTIONS TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD
SILENCED

Adam makes his way to the sink and pours himself a drink of
water He leans up against the countertop to gulp it down

Behind him we can see the KITCHEN WINDOW

OUTSIDE THE HOME

Were watching the home from the distance through the POV-
CAMERA Cold light spills out into the night as Adam can be
seen with his back to us framed in the kitchen window

The cameras microphone picks up hoarse guttural BREATHING
Metronoming in and out Over and over

Slowly our POV stalks toward the house Moving closer and
closer to Adam in the window As we do A SLIGHT REFLECTION
grows across the glass

Adam moves HES TURNING TO LOOK OUT THE WINDOW

THE KITCHEN

Adam peers out the window He senses something But it is
impossible to see anything except the reflection of the
ceiling lights in the black glass

His hand reaches over to the light switch Flips it off
DARKNESS

Any trace of the figure outside the window has vanished

A moment passes and Adam heads upstairs As he does he
notices the basement LIGHTS in the downstairs doorway

ADAM
Good night Matt
and he heads out of the room
HE DOESNT NOTICE THAT THERES NO RESPONSE FROM THE BASEMENT

Our angle switches to

OUTSIDE THE HOME

where weâre watching a from the POV-CAMERA The last set
of lights go off upstairs

The house is now in complete darkness
In the silence of the night the cameras microphone picks up
a sound we havent heard before Something soft slow and
haunting Coming directly from the killer
Theyre singing quietly
VOICE (VO)
Oh the bulldog on the bank
And the bullfrog in the pool
As the song continues our view switches to various cameras
inside the dark house
THE FAMILY ROOM
Empty and dormant
VOICE (VO)
The bulldog called the bullfrog
A green old water fool
THE KITCHEN
Dark and silent
VOICE (VO)
Singing tra la la la la la la
THE BASEMENT

A dead mans room Now occupied by the night

VOICE (VO)
Singing tra la la la la la la

THE FRONT ROOM
Cold and desolate

VOICE (VO)
Singing tra la la

SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY
Vacant
VOICE (VO)
Singing tra la la
MASTER BEDROOM
Olivia and Adam lying together Asleep
VOICE (VO)
Singing tra la la
DIEGOS ROOM
Curled up in bed out like a light
VOICE (VO)
--- lala
JAMIES ROOM
Restless and alone Staring up at the ceiling
VOICE (VO)
-- la la la la
OUTSIDE THE HOME
As the singing ends and the killers make their move

They split up Move quickly to the windows of the home
Gripping something in their hands

We switch to a POV-CAMERA and catch a closer look at the
DEVICE in their grasp

A deep black Pistol grip Like a weapon
The hand raises it to the window

It glides it along the bottom of the glass And we realize

ITS A GLUE GUN
Theyre sealing them in

Locking the family inside the home

THE FRONT ROOM

The dark empty space is illuminated by only moonlight With
the lights out we can now see out the two giant windows that
look out onto the front yard

The awful figures are there moving in silhouette And for
the first time we get a clear look at their shapes

ON THE RIGHT A threatening outline of a wretched man
Savage in his movement Solid and heavy A WALKING TERROR

ON THE LEFT A slender shape with a strange elfin form
Movements that are sharp and vicious LIKE A WASP

After a moment the figures speak to each other but all we
can hear are their faint MUFFLED VOICES Their conversation
is brief but disconcerting Shadow puppets conferring about
their plan

The two separate and the terror stalks away to the side of
the house But the wasp does not The wasp disappears from
our view and moves behind the

FRONT DOOR

A solid timber frame with a brass doorknob now filling our
view from the inside of the house We watch as a nightmare
unfolds in the familys home

The doorknob slowly turns And the door opens

The wasps knit glove is clutching MattS KEYS Careful to
slide the door open in silence

From this angle we dont see the figure entirely Only a
HAND and TORSO Moving slowly inside Silent and dangerous
THE FRONT ROOM

Were now watching the inside of the house from the POV-

CAMERA It explores the room moving in stealth The
microphone picks up the sounds of strained wheezing

Then an image is seen in our POV Hanging on the wall Our
view moves and reveals it in the moonlight
A FAMILY PORTRAIT

A captured moment of smiles and joy It stands in stark
contrast to the menace that lurks in the home now

The breathing continues to provide a soundtrack to the night

A hand reaches into our POV -- edging toward the portrait
It grasps the wooden frame

And slides it askew

Our POV lingers -- staring at it -- now angled on the wall
awkwardly

Then our view turns away and moves out of the front room --
moving further into the house Stops at the base of the
stairs

A moment passes

Our angle swivels upward to get a look at something

The second floor Where theyre sleeping

MASTER BEDROOM

Were in the master bedroom looking out through the doorway
into the hall

Adam and Olivia can be seen from another angle sleeping
soundly

Looking out onto the hall there is a cold stillness that
permeates the space We pick up the soft sounds of a home at
night CREAKS MURMURS Filling the emptiness

A DARK FIGURE APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY TO THE BEDROOM

The wasp

Motionless and silent A looming statue

Although the figure is cloaked in the shadows we can make
out something clearly now

THEYRE WEARING A MASK

It is stark and simple Large compound eyes -- ovular and
marble black

Stunted angular antennae protruding from the top Pointed
mandibles on the bottom that curve into each other like a
vice

Its the image of a GHOSTLY BLACK WASP

Short curled hair fans out wildly from the back of the mask

Aching moments pass

The figure slowly cocks their head and with it the mask --
all while their body stays utterly motionless

Observing An animal sizing up its prey

Adam and Olivia remain sleeping in silence Their torsos
moving rhythmically up and down Inhaling Exhaling An
image of peace and calm

Quickly spoiled as the wasp mask slowly lowers into view

Inches away from the sleeping couple as they lay powerless in
their bed

It studies them lingering over their faces

Then moves out of view and disappears -- as we remain focused
on the sleeping couple

Adam stirs but does not wake Olivia remains in deep sleep
And in a moment that is startling and sudden our angle
changes to

DIEGOS ROOM

-- where the wasp is now standing staring at the boy in
complete and total stillness

Watching the boy sleep in his small bed
The wasp exits the room slipping into the hallway in
silence Our view switches to
JAMIES ROOM

where shes is curled up in bed The stress from the
day remains washed over her face But now shes dreaming

Paralyzed in sleep

Our view slowly widens to reveal a figure directly across
from Jamie sitting on her lowboy dresser

THE WASP IS IN HER ROOM NOW -- hands frozen on knees --
sitting in complete stillness -- watching -- observing -- as
the teenage girl stirs in her sleep

Our angle switches to close on Jamies face -- her head
moving involuntarily -- fighting off a dream -- unaware of
the nightmare thats right in front of her

A SUDDEN NOISE -- from somewhere close -- a CREAKING
Jamies eyes POP OPEN

She sits up in her bed breathing heavily now

As our angle changes she doesnt see the wasp slipping out
of her room and disappearing into the second floor hallway

Jamie scans her empty room for a moment -- then slides back
onto her pillow

She shuts her eyes

Then we hear it again
MOVEMENT

Jamie POPS UP in her bed

JAMIE
Hello

She waits for an answer but receives none

Jamie pauses to listen leaving enough time to convince
herself that its simply the sounds of the house settling

It happens again SOMETHING IS MOVING

Jamie finds herself out of her bed -- looking around --
trying to locate where the noise is coming from

She hears it again THE SOUND
Its coming from the roof
An animal maybe Or footsteps

Jamie spins toward her window -- moves toward it slowly --
listening for the noise in anticipation

She inches closer and closer -- peering at the glass Trees
and night sky can be seen outside And we notice something

Theres a ledge under her window frame -- the roof from an
extension of the floor below
Jamie moves closer -- and closer -- reaching her hand out
toward the glass
OUTSIDE JAMIES WINDOW

Were watching Jamie from a camera mounted on the roof below
her window We can see her coming towards us

And we can see something else above her window frame -- on
the roof

A PAIR OF GRIMEY RUNNING SHOES

Waiting right there

JAMIES ROOM

Jamies hand moves towards the glass -- then shifts towards
her lamp -- fingers about to turn on the bulb -- and right
before she does -- right before the light sparks -- she sees
it A shadow cast from the moonlight on the lawn below

ITS THE SHAPE OF A FIGURE STANDING ON THE ROOF

But before it can register shes turned on the lamp

Jamie squints to adjust to the light -- breathing heavily now
-- fighting off her fear -- struggling with what she saw

Then makes a decision

Her hand reaches for the light switch -- her chest heaving up
and down now -- determined to confirm whats shes just seen

The light goes off -- darkness fills the room -- and Jamie
presses her hands against the glass to peer outside
OUTSIDE FROM THE WINDOW

The shadow is gone The night is still

Only an empty back yard and the light of the moon

JAMIES ROOM

Jamie breathes a heavy sigh of relief She takes a moment to
compose herself -- takes a deep breath -- thankful its
nothing
44
And with shocking violence something leaps onto ledge of the
roof -- shrieking as it lands -- clawing at the glass
JAMIE IS IMMEDIATELY PARALYZED WITH FEAR
Then she sees it -- a clear view of what is on her roof
ITS A RACCOON Hissing

JAMIE
Jesus christ

She brings her hand to her chest catching her breath
Desperate to control her panic

She notices --

THE ANIMAL IS BLEEDING -- struggling to move its legs --
panting

It HISSES violently Jamie goes white

JAMIE
Shit

She moves to the window but the frightened animal hobbles up
and scurries off the roof into the darkness somewhere

Jamie watches him go Releases a deep cathartic breath

Fighting the feeling that something isnt right

ON THE STAIRS

Were watching Jamies open doorway from the POV-CAMERA at
the top of the stairs looking through the second floor
bannister

Moments pass and the cameras microphone picks up movement
from the teenagers room

Our POV lingers on her doorway

Then Jamie exits her bedroom into the dark hall and our view
sinks down the stairs hiding from her sight

From our lower vantage point we can still hear her FOOTSTEPS
moving along the hall Our POV follows their sound along the
bannister Then for a brief instant she appears in our
view

No idea that someone is downstairs watching her

And before she can even realize shes made her way into the
SECOND FLOOR BATHROOM

where she enters and closes the door Flips on THE SOFT
LIGHT

A slow panic manifests itself on her face

Jamie cracks open the door and peers into the hallway
Listens for hints of movement

But there are none
Only the soft CREAKS and POPS of a home at night
She turns and sits on the toilet to pee

THEN STARES AT THE TRASHCAN

SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

Stillness fills the home as the sound of peeing can be heard
from behind the bathroom door

Our angle switches to a view looking down the stairs

It is empty Dark Except for a soft red light from a smoke
detector down below It throws angular shadows on the wall

The silence is interrupted by the sound of a flushing toilet
It draws our attention back into the
SECOND FLOOR BATHROOM

where the hissing of the refill valve comes to a soft
end Jamie is staring at the garbage

The pregnancy test Right there
She comes to a decision

Jamie moves to the container -- reaches her hand toward it --
about to grasp the contents inside when --

A TERRIBLE NOISE CAN BE HEARD FROM DOWNSTAIRS
Something has CRASHED ONTO THE FLOOR

Hearing it is chilling

Jamie PANICS

She rushes out of the bathroom

SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

Jamie stops at the top of the stairs A look of fear plays
on her face

JAMIE
Dad Dad

Theres a rustling FOOTSTEPS Adam appears in the hallway

ADAM
Jamie Whats going on

JAMIE
I heard something

Her frightened eyes stare into the dark void below

We see the darkness she sees The only thing coming from the
black is silence

A lights goes on from Diegos room
Olivia appears from the master bedroom

OLIVIA
Whats the matter

JAMIE
I heard something

Olivia isnt sure what to make of the situation
Diego emerges from his room squinting and rubbing his eyes

DIEGO
Whats everyone doing

JAMIE
Shh

The family goes silent Moments pass Then it happens
again

A soft noise from downstairs

Adam peers down to the first floor But the light from
Diegos room is throwing everything below into darkness

ADAM
Diego shut off the light in your
room
Diego disappears into his room -- the light goes off -- then

he returns to the hallway with his family
They all huddle together at the top of the stairs in silence

Adam takes a step towards the staircase -- gazes down at the
first floor again

He comes to a sudden stop Alarm plays over his face

Its clear now A sound -- coming from downstairs -- slow
and sudden

CREAKING -- from the floorboards Like the home is
screaming

It fills the family with panic

Diego and Olivia huddle together Jamie collects herself off
to the side next to them

There is a tense moment inside of Adam Instinct is taking
over Concern is washing over his face And with it fear

He signals the family to move back

ADAM
Whos there

It happens again The sound This time loud and clear
The floorboards
Someone is down there Walking on them

ADAM
Matt is that you

Adam hears another sound One thats even worse than what
hes heard so far

VOICES
Whispering
Adam stiffens with dread

Theres more than one of them down there

ADAM
Whos down there

Silence Adam turns to his wife and whispers
ADAM
(softly)

Olivia get your cell phone

Olivia vanishes into the bedroom Moments pass and she
emerges handing the device over to her husband

ADAM
Im going to call the police

More silence
Then something crashes in the front room below
Adam turns to his family to calm them
ADAM
(softly)
Its ok

But its not The entire family feels it Theyre
terrified

ADAM
Olivia stay in the room with the
kids

Adam moves to a light fixture on the wall Unscrews the
bulb

OLIVIA
What are you doing

ADAM
Just stay in the room

Adam smashes the bulb against the wall startling his family
He grips his hand around the metal cap as shards of glass
protrude from inside Hes holding it as a weapon

JAMIE
Dad no

ADAM
I said get in the room Jamie

Olivia gathers Diego and Jamie into the room as Adam makes
his way down the first step He speaks into the void below

ADAM
Matt you got to tell me if thats
you Im coming down

Adam is gripping his makeshift weapon in his hand but a
clear sense of fear plays on his face

He slowly achingly makes his way to the first floor

THE FRONT ROOM

Adam steps down the last stair into the darkened front room

MASTER BEDROOM

Olivia is cradling her arm around her son Jamie stands at
the doorway trying to see what is happening

OLIVIA
Jamie come in the room

JAMIE
Shh

The teenagers face is showing a deep concern for her father
Soon she finds herself moving toward the top of the stairs to
get a closer look

OLIVIA
Jamie

But Jamie is ignoring her It worries Diego

DIEGO
Mom

OLIVIA
Its fine Its just a noise its
fine

Meanwhile Jamie has stepped onto the stairs to keep an eye on
her father

THE FRONT ROOM

Adam steps further into the room -- scans the darkness --
then sees something It sends a wave of cold dread over his
face

SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

Jamie peers at the front room SCREAMS

THE FRONT ROOM
We see what she sees
AN AWFUL FIGURE
Looming in front of Adam Right there The TERROR A
figure that even in stillness exudes an explosive violence --
breathing like a bull -- POV-CAMERA attached to his shoulder
And we notice something else
Something on his head takes a moment to comprehend
Then we realize
Itâs an UNSEALED PLASTIC BAG
The thick SEMITRANSPARENT material is DRAPED over his scalp
all the way down to his neck Moisture from his breath FOGS
UP THE LOWER VIEW OF HIS FACE in irregular patterns
ADAM

Who are you What the hell are you

doing in here
The terror watches So do we
Adam frightened eyes cannot make sense of the image in front
of him He fumbles as he punches numbers on Loris cell
phone
But before he can dial 911 -- the bag comes off
It is immediately SNAPPED OVER HIS HEAD
Panic erupts in the home as the SILHOUETTED figure HEAVES
ADAM INTO THE AIR strangling him with the plastic bag
Adams arms and legs flail spastically as he gasps for air

that isnât there

The cell phone DROPS FROM ADAMS HANDS The light bulb
SHATTERS onto the floor

Olivia screams from upstairs
Jamie and Diego shout

JAMIE
DAD

Adamâs eyes are overcome with fear but his body is overcome
with instinct His limbs are simply doing anything they can
to free himself so he can breathe But the terror will have
none of it

Still clasping the bag around Adamâs neck the terror SLAMS
Adamâs head against the wall in a demonstration of violence
that is brutal and shocking

BLOOD SPRAYS against the inside of the bag as Adam gasps for
his last remaining breaths

There are SCREAMS coming from upstairs -- a nightmare
happening in front of their eyes

Until its over Adams life fades away The father and
husband is thrown to the ground His body lands in an
awkward contortion His foot spasms uncontrollably His
body goes still

Silence
The terror wipes the blood away from the inside of the top of
the bag -- clearing it for his eyes -- and places the bag
back on his head

A DEATH MASK

Now smeared in blood -- two diagonal swipes revealing his
eyes -- crazed and dangerous
THE STAIRS

A long piercing cry rips loose from deep within Jamie

JAMIE
NoOoOOoO

Her eyes are fighting back the shock and horror of the
tragedy shes just witnessed Olivia and Diego stand above
her in a panic

But before Jamie has time to breathe the wasp appears at the
bottom of the stairs

OLIVIA
(hushed)
Jamie goddamit get up here

Olivia clasps Jamies collar and heaves her step-daughter up
the stairs into the master bedroom with Diego She SLAMS the
door shut and were left watching an empty hall and closed
wooden doorframe

MASTER BEDROOM

The room is silent except for the sounds coming from the
weary family who are now clutching each other in agony
NOISES and MURMURS escape from their mouths involuntarily --
primal sounds of despair and shock Olivia gasps for breath
Diego whimpers fighting his fear and panic Jamie stares
into space Withdrawn

OLIVIA
Whats happening

Olivias voice twists into a sob She begins to weep in
front of the children Her head angles into the air and she
cries out to the universe faltering with emotion her voice
cracking

OLIVIA
Please Whats happening Please

Her words linger in the air The despair the loss the
horror in this moment are overwhelming She cries as she
embraces her son and step-daughter

DIEGO
Is he dead Oh my god is he
dead

JAMIE

Dont say that No dont say that

A moment passes and Olivia comes to a realization Shes
looking at something

OLIVIA
The door

But the children are too dazed to respond

OLIVIA
We need to block the door Now

Olivia moves to the DRESSER by the bed and starts to heave
the furniture Jamie and Diego join her Aching moments
pass as the furniture is slowly hauled across the room toward
the door It TEARS the carpet as it moves

OLIVIA
Come on quickly Push

And with what remains of their adrenaline the dresser is
slammed up against the door

No one is getting into that room without tearing down the
door

Olivia dashes over to her nightstand -- grasps the telephone
headset -- snaps it to her ear -- then realizes --
OLIVIA
Shit Shit

She remembers the line has been cancelled

Olivia scans the room Her eyes desperately search for
something

JAMIE
What is it

Olivia reaches into a purse on the ground then discards it
She yanks open drawers then slams them shut

OLIVIA
(frantic)
My cell Goddammit he brought it
down there

Jamie doesnt know what to do so she searches the room along
with her step-mother Diego follows

JAMIE
What about dads Wheres his

OLIVIA
He charges it by the door in the
kitchen Takes it on his way out
in the morning

Theres a grim realization that hits the family There are
very few options left for them

Diego finally speaks

DIEGO
Are they coming for us too

He looks to his mother So does Jamie But Olivia doesnt
know how to answer The only thing on her mind -- the only
thing her eyes can see -- is the door to the hall that now
looms in front of them Our angle switches to the

SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

- where we see the other side of the closed family room
door

The hall is now silent and empty Like a crypt

THE FRONT ROOM
Still and deserted -- now with a haunting centerpiece
THE SLAIN BODY OF A HUSBAND AND FATHER

Face down on the floor -- limbs twisted in awful angles

THE FAMILY ROOM

Vacant and quiet A fluorescent bulb in the fish tank casts
long shadows on the wall

THE KITCHEN

Where there are no figures to be seen The room is desolate
and noiseless

But we do notice something different about the room from when
weve seen it last The items the father had placed on the
kitchen table

TOTALLY DESTROYED

The cell phone is CRUSHED -- the X-BOX SHATTERED -- the
computer CRACKED APART

Even the fathers phone can be seen by the door FRACTURED
AND RUINED

The fact is there is no chance of rescue from this place
anymore The only hope left -- if there is any -- is escape
OUTSIDE THE HOME

Were looking at the home from the outside

No sign of the intruders

MASTER BEDROOM

Olivia and Jamie are standing on opposite sides of the bed
Diego remains by his mothers side They are all WEARY AND
FRIGHTENED We pick them up mid-conversation in hushed
tones

JAMIE
(stricken)
-- we cant leave him there like
that We have to do something We
need to get him some help

Olivia struggles with a decision Sheâs terrified of what
she knows sheâs about to do

OLIVIA
Jaime Right now we cant think
about that All we can think
about is getting out of this
house

Jamies panic is turning to frustration and she has a target
for it right here in the room her step-mother

JAMIE
How How are we going to do that
Theyre out there

Olivia is trying to remain calm but Jamies anger is
lighting her fuse

OLIVIA
We go out the window

Theres a moment of silence in the realization of their
limited options Jamie gazes at the DRAWN WINDOW SHADES It
is an option that seems far better than heading out the door
of the room

She moves to window and carefully pulls aside the shades --
notes the precipitous drop below

JAMIE
Wed break our legs For sure It
has to be at least fifteen feet
And even if-

Jamie stops short and instantly brings her hand to her mouth
in horror Her eyes are seeing something awful outside the
window

JAMIE
Oh my god

The moment stretches It proves too much for Diego He
finally speaks

DIEGO
What is it Whats the matter

Jamie is fighting back the terrible realization of what shes
seeing

JAMIE
Its uncle Matt Oh my god no

Olivia runs to the window Peers outside
THERE IN THE BACK OF HIS PICKUP TRUCK IS MATTS DEAD BODY
The image is devastating to Olivia

JAMIE
(rattled)
I dont understand We dont have
any money We dont have anything

Diego starts to whimper feeding off the fear and distress in
the room Olivia sees it in his eyes and her motherly
instinct kicks in She grasps her sons arm and speaks in a
way that shifts from anxiety to action

OLIVIA
Okay Were going to find a way to
get downstairs and get out of this
house So I want you two to scour
this room for anything we can use
to protect us Anything sharp We
need a weapon Lets go Lets
go

And Olivia is off scanning the room Diego and Jamie become
galvanized by her energy and follow her lead

We watch as DRESSER DRAWERS are pulled out CLOSETS are
examined and CABINETS are emptied Moments go by Then
Diego speaks

DIEGO
I found something

Olivia and Jamie turn to see that hes holding something in
his hands

Its a rusty KNITTING NEEDLE While it is shaped like a long
spike its dull edge makes it no serious weapon

OLIVIA
Thats good Thats something
A noise stops Diego and Olivia cold
Its GLASS BREAKING

They turn to find Jamie stomping on a FAMILY PICTURE torn off
the wall

OLIVIA
Jamie

But Jamie doesnt need to explain herself Shes picking up
a SHARD OF GLASS from the broken portrait It is sharp it
is long and it is DANGEROUS

JAMIE
Find something better

Olivia exhales Her stepdaughter is right Shes improvised
something out of nothing

The woman reaches out her palm and Jamie carefully hands the
make-shift weapon over to her step-mother

OLIVIA
Is that everything

JAMIE
There is something else In my
room

OLIVIA

What is it

JAMIES ROOM
We see THE TASER on the floor of the room

Lying still in the darkness

MASTER BEDROOM

Olivia grabs a nearby shirt and wraps it around the base of
the glass to grip it without injury

OLIVIA
Okay Were going to open that
door and were going to stay
together

Olivia exhales and embraces her son She then turns to her
step-daughter the friction of their relationship a lifetime
away and gently holds her hand

OLIVIA
Were going to stay together

Jamie squeezes her stepmothers hand in return
The moment stretches Everyone tenses
OLIVIA
Lets go
SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

The door RATTLES from the furniture being heaved away behind
it

The doorknob turns -- then is thrown open

Olivia emerges first WIELDING THE GLASS IN HER HAND like a
blade Jamie and Diego behind her

OLIVIA
Stay with me

She moves forward with vigilant steps towards the mouth of
the stairs Darkness and moonlight surround her The
figures could be lurking anywhere

Olivia comes to a halt and takes a moment to scan the home
looking for signs of danger Then when shes decided the
time is right her foot leaves the ground and descends from
the top stair to the next As it connects with the lower
step a long TERRIBLE SOUND emits from the wood and fills
the hall

CREAKING Loud and obvious
All movement stops The family stands silent in the hallway
in anticipation And just as it seems theyve gone

unnoticed it happens --

A shadow moves from a dark corner downstairs Then appears
A grisly apparition

THE WASP -- WAITING FOR THEM ON THE FIRST FLOOR

Olivia becomes paralyzed for a moment -- tries to sense the
ominous figures intentions below

THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS

Our angle switches to the POV-CAMERA looking up at the
stricken family at the top of the staircase The cameras
microphone picks up the wasps voice

WASP
Singing tra la-la la-la
And our view moves -- one step upward -- stepping closer to
the family

SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

Olivia holds out her GLASS BLADE with one arm and shields the
children with the other

DIEGO
Mom Theyre coming up

Olivias instinct is causing her to back away But Jamies
face has changed from fear to purpose Her eyes turn to her
BEDROOM and observe the darkened space inside

JAMIE
I can get it
The wasp moves another step -- slow -- steady singing all
the way
WASP

-- Tra la-la la-la

OLIVIA
Stay with me

But Jamie has already decided

OLIVIA
No

Jamie breaks away speeding toward her room to collect the
only weapon in the home

JAMIES ROOM

She races into the room -- her frightened eyes scanning the
space for the Taser -- knowing every corner hides grim
possibilities She locates the device in the shadows on her

desk

Then she notices something

HER WINDOW IS OPEN

Jamie moves slowly toward the desk -- studying the darkness
behind the window -- trembling as she goes

A tension fills the air -- the dread that lies behind that
open window is terrifying but also mesmerizing Shes
transfixed by it Its as if something awful might appear in
the empty void if she were to look away

Fear suffocates the young girls face as she moves closer --
step after step After a moment her eyes dart away and
settle on her desk

SHE SCREAMS

Splayed across her desk is the corpse of the raccoon

The image sends her falling over her desk chair onto the
floor

Jamie takes a moment to confirm what she sees in front of
her

OLIVIA (0S)
Theyâre coming

Jamie brings herself to her feet -- sees the Taser resting on
the desk right behind the animal She extends her hand
slowly over the creatures face toward the weapon

THEN IN AN INSTANT THE ANIMALS MOUTH SNAPS OPEN AND
RELEASES A DARK GUTTURAL HISS

Jamie jerks back The animal falls still

Jamie seizes the moment -- moves quickly to the weapon --
GRASPS IT in her hands -- then spins and and aims it at the
empty room

Jamie runs to her door extending her arm with Taser in hand
She slips into the

SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

where the wasp is halfway up the stairs

Shaking Jamie raises her weapon and aims it over the
railing

JAMIE
Get back

She SQUEEZES THE TRIGGER
Nothing happens
Jamie struggles with the taser desperate to make it fire

She tries again but her finger is met with the same impotent
response

JAMIE
Come on
The wasp creeps up one step -- lingers on it -- and waits
there
OLIVIA

Get away from us Leave us alone
Jamie reaches out the taser and tries again
Nothing
The teenagers expression turns from desperation to
frustration as she SQUEEZES the locked trigger In this
moment a wave of emotion pours out of her and she finds
herself speaking directly to the intruder in her home

JAMIE
What do you want What do you want

from us

Olivia knows the seriousness of the situation and tries to
silence her step-daughter

OLIVIA
Be quiet

Theres a moment of silence

A voice then speaks from behind the mask

It is surprisingly soft But its not delicate Rather it
carries a forced calm like a dentist speaking to a patient

before they drill into their teeth

WASP
He wants to see if youll live

This response delivers a tension into the room thats
stronger than before Olivia can feel it

She pleads

OLIVIA
Please You can take anything you
want Just leave us alone
(pleading)
Please dont kill us

WASP
Not yet He wants to give you a
chance

The wasp remains focused on Jamie whose face is beginning to
show signs of defiance An anger is building under the
surface and some of it escapes out of her mouth --

JAMIE
What are you talking about

The wasp takes a moment to respond Then Jamie sees masked
figure do something she wasnt expecting

Back away

The intruder slowly descends the staircase one step at a
time

WASP
There are hunters and there are
gatherers Most people are
gatherers They take what they
can

A step
WASP
Some are hunters They take what
they want and dont care about
anything else

And another

WASP
Most times the gatherers starve

The Wasp comes to a halt on the ground floor

WASP
Which one are you Jamie

Jamie registers surprise at the mention of her name

THE STAIRS

Our view switches to the POV-CAMERA now We see Jamie and
the family on the second floor staring fearfully

JAMIE
How do you know my name

Our view recedes into the front room

Into complete darkness

SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY

Jamie has joined her weary and demoralized family at the top
of the stairs They are struggling to comprehend what
theyve just witnessed and stand in total stunned silence

DIEGO
(disturbed)
What The fuck Was that

OLIVIA
These people are crazy I dont
know what they want from us but we
cant stay here Well try for the
door and if we cant make it well
go through a window

The children take stock of their grim options
OLIVIA
Its going to be fast so stay with
me

Jamie raises her taser

JAMIE
How do we get it to work

Olivia examines the weapon Its a foreign object to her
Her eyes scan the device as her fingers search its
components

OLIVIA
Are you sure its charged

JAMIE
Wouldnt it fire either way

OLIVIA
Maybe you have to--

The two are interrupted by a sudden soft voice Diegos

DIEGO
(matter of fact)
You have to switch off the safety

Olivia and Jamies turn to the boy and are surprised to hear
this definitive comment coming from this 14 year old boy

With a CLICK he reaches for the grip of the weapon and slides
off the safety switch

OLIVIA
How did you know that

DIEGO
I can tell you how to load
chamber and fire every weapon
since world war two
They look at him curiously How

DIEGO
Call of Duty

Olivia and Jamie allow themselves a grim smile Its an
extremely brief moment of levity and it quickly fades
Everyone exhales slowly Olivia finally breaks the silence

OLIVIA
Okay Lets go

She takes the lead and descends the staircase GLASS BLADE in
hand Jamie follows behind her clutching onto the TASER

OLIVIA
Stay with me

The two move carefully step after step heading down into
the hell that awaits them on the first floor

OLIVIA
Jamie you with me

JAMIE
Im here

A moment passes and Olivia checks in with her son

OLIVIA
Diego you okay

No response

OLIVIA
Diego
Again no response Olivia spins around
Diego remains standing at the top of the stairs paralyzed

This is the most terrifying moment of his life and he cannot
bring himself to move

OLIVIA
Diego
DIEGO
(trembling)
I cant
OLIVIA

Diego get down here now We need
to stay together

Jamie turns to her step-brother

JAMIE
Diego Come on

The boy shrinks back in fear towards the doorway of his room
Then --

SUDDENLY WE ARE AWARE OF SOMETHING STANDING IN DIEGOS
DOORWAY -- silhouetted in the darkness

The outline becomes more and more clear IT IS THE TERROR
wearing the bag over his head RIGHT BEHIND Diego

Diego suddenly moves away from the corner
The terror lunges out at him

JAMIE
Diego

Diego spins around and SCREAMS
The terror stands there raising his arm about to take the
bag off his head The boy SCREAMS again in panic and leaps

backward TUMBLING down the stairs into Jamies arms

JAMIE
Run

The family runs panting with an intensity that comes from
pure panic

The terror moves to the top of the staircase and heads down
after them

THE FRONT ROOM

Three SILHOUETTES race down the stairs and enter the vacant
room where Adams dead body lies motionless on the floor
This morbid image forces the family to a sudden stop But
the noises of the terror descending the staircase send the
family into action

OLIVIA
Get to the door

Olivia takes Diego under her arm and dashes for the door
Jamie follows behind but when she nears her father she stops
and drops to his body collapsing onto him

She screams Cries

JAMIE
Dad no Dad please

Olivia is about to reach the door but hears her step-
daughters voice and spins around

OLIVIA
Jamie JAMIE

JAMIE
I cant leave him here

OLIVIA
Jamie get over here NOW

But Jamie cant leave her fathers side

Olivia pulsing with adrenaline Olivia drops her glass blade
and runs over to grab Jamie by the arm

OLIVIA
We need to go

Jamie cries as she is pulled away from her fallen father
Together the family runs across the dark room to THE FRONT
DOOR Olivia unlocks the door BUT IT WONT OPEN She heaves
the doorknob desperately

DIEGO
Mom

Olivias head snaps up -- sees what Diego sees -- outside the
window -- standing there like a nightmare -- THE WASP --
WAITING WITH A MEDITATIVE CALM

OLIVIA
Go to the back

They break into a run crossing past the stairs where the
terror is almost upon them The harrowing figure LUNGES
FORWARD toward the family

They miss feet apart

Olivia leads Jamie and Diego into

THE KITCHEN

Â» where her momentum brings her right up against the side
door She grasps the KNOB and twists But something is
wrong It wont budge Olivia tries again rattling the
frame as she struggles to pry open the door But her hands
are met with the same response

THE DOORS HAVE BEEN SEALED

OLIVIA
The windows Try the windows

Jamies reaction is immediate Shes at the windows
reaching to heave them open But her hands are no more
successful than her step-mothers

JAMIE
I cant get them open

Olivia SLAMS her fist against the window She pounds with
all her might

OLIVIA
Please

She releases all her force and the glass spiderwebs into
shattered glass The broken shards jut out and SLICE her
palm

She SCREAMS in agony Blood DRIPS down her arm

DIEGO
Mom

OLIVIA
Stay with me

Theres a moment of grave panic Olivia spins fighting off
her pain She runs to the KITCHEN TABLE There she sees the
various pieces of DESTROYED TECHNOLOGY She picks up Jamies
CELL PHONE frantic now -- punches three numbers into the
keypad -- but its no use Its dead

The options are running out Olivia knows it Jamie and
Diego are feeding off her fear

Then theres a terrible sound

The front door is creaking open

THE FRONT ROOM

Were watching from the POV camera now -- entering the house -
- then moving through the front room like a phantom --
microphone picking up DEEP DREADFUL BREATHS -- heading past

the fathers body towards the door to the kitchen

THE KITCHEN

Moments pass and TWO FIGURES APPEAR inside the kitchen
doorway

THE WASP AND THE TERROR

Standing right there on the other side of the room

Now the family has no choice but to face them directly
separated only by an insufficient island of protection the
kitchen table

The two figures move slowly towards their victims

Olivia grasps Diego and Jamies hands and backs them away

into the corner of the kitchen She tries to be brave as she
speaks to the children

OLIVIA
Its okay Stay with me its
okay
The awful figures inch closer and closer -- with nowhere else
for the family to go -- and just as they make their move --

Olivia THRUSTS her family into

THE BASEMENT STAIRWAY

where they TUMBLE INSIDE Before anyone can react
Olivia slams the door shut and bolts the lock from inside
THE KITCHEN

We watch as the POV camera smashes against the wooden frame
of the basement door -- slamming it with violence

THE BASEMENT STAIRWAY

Loud furious crashes rattle the door as the family waits to
see if the bolt will hold

Olivias hand remains clasping the lock in anticipation

Its as if the act of removing it will somehow send the door
flying open

But the lock holds The crashes come to a halt And the
only remaining movement is the deep heavy breathing from the
three terrified family members at the top of a basement
staircase

Moments pass and they head down into the bowels of the home

THE KITCHEN
Empty now No sign of wasp or terror

Only a lingering sense of dread

THE BASEMENT

The family stands in the darkness of the silent room They
stare in numb horror The nightmare refuses to end

Olivia takes this moment to embrace her son He sinks into
her arms The exhausted mother reaches out to her step-
daughter Jamie is stricken and collapses into her step-
mothers embrace

The moment stretches
OLIVIA
We need to search the room See if

Matt left his phone

The three comb the room for anything they can use to
communicate with the outside world

Olivia searches the night stand next to the bed
Diego peers into the bathroom
Nothing Nothing at all

When Olivia turns around she sees something that startles
her

Jamie is frozen in front of the basement closet mesmerized
by something inside

OLIVIA
Jamie

A moment passes

Jamies hands open the door completely and we see whats
inside --

A MARATHON BIB PINNED ON A NEON PINK WINDBREAKER

The one Jamies mother was wearing in the desktop picture on
her computer It just hangs there draped over a coat
hanger Breast cancer ribbon attached to the sleeve

The emotional impact of this discovery hits the entire room

Olivia becomes pensive Melancholy She watches as her step-
daughter stares wistfully at the piece of nostalgia in front
of her

Then she approaches Jamie Reaches out her arm and places it
around her shoulders The young teenager looks into her step-
mothers eyes and doesnt have to say anything She simply
falls into her new mothers embrace

After a moment Olivia struggles with a decision Shes
staring at something and is terrified of what she knows sheâs
about to do

OLIVIA
Im going out

Jamie and Diegos eyes turn and sees what she sees
The small basement window well
OLIVIA

If I can fit I can go outside and
get help

DIEGO
No What if theyre out there
waiting
A silent moment as Olivia thinks

OLIVIA
Just stay with your sister

And with that Olivia approaches the window She takes a
deep breath and twists the latches

It falls open A first chance to escape into the outside
world

Olivia reaches her hand into the window well

OLIVIA
Help me up
They heave Olivia up into the air She squeezes out into the
backyard -- then turns and speaks to her children
OLIVIA

Dont leave each other

Jamie watches as her step-mother heads toward the darkness
After a few steps Olivia stops She turns around to look
one more time at her children Jamie and Olivias eyes meet
The two look at one another knowing this may be the last
time they see each other alive

Then we watch as Olivia disappears into the night --
surrounded by darkness

Time passes -- too much time -- aching moments Jamie
cradles Diego now his only remaining protector

DIEGO
Are we going to die

Jamie gazes at her step-brother troubled by both the ominous
statement and by the situation that produced this grim
outlook in him

JAMIE
Im not going to leave you

Diego moves to his step-sister and clings to her arm
The two share a silent moment They breathe together And

they wait Watching the night through the frame of the small
basement window Our view switches to

THE BACK YARD

- where we watch from an overhead camera attached to the
roof The night reveals little Only the lawn which
disappears into a dark row of trees After a moment
something appears from the shadows at the edge of the
property

The wasp

Who slowly turns and hisses in short unnerving bursts

This bizarre signal dissipates into the night Then --

The terror emerges from the hidden darkness

THE BASEMENT

Jamie and Diego watch in silence desperate to remain safe
from the two figures in the distance

Then they hear it Someone speaking from the woods
Its Olivia Frantic
OLIVIA (0S)
Help Somebody help us
THE BACK YARD

Wasp and terror slide back into the wooded darkness After a
moment Olivia can be seen emerging from the canopy of Oaks

She breaks into a run But then --

There he is The terror HE RUNS AFTER HER

THE BASEMENT

Jamie and Diego watch Olivia sprint across the yard panting
with an intensity verging on hysteria

But she doesnât get far Oliviaâs feet slip She skids and
collapses onto the ground When she looks up THE TERROR IS
STANDING ABOVE HER

Jamie and Diego watch in horror as he grabs their mother and
heaves her upward She screams as her body fights to escape
swaying into and out of the darkness

THE SCREAMS ARE DEEP AND DISTURBING They echo in the night
air

Diego becomes desperate Hes pressing his hands against his
ears Terrified Jamie grabs her brother tight and covers
his face

In an instant the screams are silenced Muffled now from
the bag that is smothering Olivia and draining her life

From our angle we can only see the part of her struggle Her
legs and feet sway at awkward angles After a moment they
convulse
Become limp
Olivias life fades away
Jamie watches as her stepmotherâs body is dropped into the
shadows Then her eyes settle on a macabre image OLIVIAS
FACE Lifeless in the moonlight
Instinct takes over Jamie She spins to Diego
JAMIE

Diego go to that bathroom and lock

yourself inside Dont open that

door unless I say so do you

understand me
Diego fights off shock and does as hes told
Jamie spins back to the window -- Olivias face in the
distance staring back at her -- and the stricken girl cries

out releasing all her emotion

JAMIE
No NOoOoOoOo

Her words hang in the night air and dissolve SILENCE The
only sound Jamies deep adrenaline filled breathing

Breath
After breath 22
After breath
Jamie alone in the room
A beat

In the distance the terror begins to walk toward the
basement window

Jamie battles her feelings Despair fear sadness
Until all are replaced by a new emotion
ANGER
JAMIE
Come on Thatâs right goddammit
come here Come right he--

Before Jamie can finish A PAIR OF LEGS APPEAR IN THE WINDOW

Then the wasp lowers into view -- mask filling the frame of
the basement window

JAMIE RELEASES A PRIMAL SCREAM
Is is violent and raw

A CRACKING NOISE Like a stove fighting to ignite Loud and
sharp

The wasp starts to convulse

Jamie continues her shriek into the wasps mask and we
realize what is happening

THE TASER

Its clasped in Jamies hand -- releasing 150000 volts into
the wasps neck

Moments pass and the cracking stops Jamies howl decays
into silence The only sounds she can muster are short

staccato breaths -- while the wasp lies paralyzed -- right
there in the window -- moaning from electric shock
DIEGO (0S)

Jamie Jamie

Jamie clutches her chest breathing hard
JAMIE

Im fine Diego Im fine Just

stay inside
Jamie snaps Surprising herself she finds her hands
reaching slowly toward the mask Her fingers extend around
its sides

She tears it off the wasps face

What she sees underneath is a total surprise

THE WASP IS A WOMAN

Her face is difficult to make out from the electrical burns
All we can see is that her cheeks are emaciated Her eyes
menacing A grim reaper without a hood

Jamie is stunned

JAMIE
Why are you doing this

Wasps lips struggle to move
WASP
He decides when its over Itâs

not the end yet Hes in control
of everything

Jamie tases the wasp again leaving her moaning in the window
well

Diego emerges from the bathroom door

DIEGO
Are you okay

Jamie rushes over to her step-brother and hugs him
desperately She sobs in his arms

What Jamie cant see is that behind her THE WASP IS
DESCENDING SLOWLY FROM THE WINDOW WELL INTO THE BASEMENT

Jamie squeezes her step-brother tight Then she senses
something She looks at his face

His eyes are going wide

JAMIE
Whats wrong

Jamie spins Sees

THE WASP RIGHT BEHIND HER

Unmasked and RAISING THE 12 INCH HUNTING KNIFE INTO THE AIR
Jamie reacts instantly

She tackles the wasp and the two SLAM onto the basement
floor The knife goes SKITTERING across the room

The two grapple quick and vicious Spinning off each other
like entwined snakes

Jamie manages to break free and grabs for anything she can
use to protect herself Her hands find a POOL CUE leaning up
against the wall

SWASH SWASH

Jamie swats it at the wasp

But the wasp has found the knife

SLASH SLASH

The wasp slashes it at Jamie

Jamie tightens her grip on the pool cue

She swings it at the wasp hard But the stick breaks in
half leaving only a shard of wood

Wasp moves to Jaime who is clutching the broken cue in her
hand

THE EVIL FIGURE RAISES THE KNIFE INTO THE AIR

This is it Theres no escape for Jamie Nowhere to run
The only option is to face the blade that is aimed right for
her

Wasps arm starts to swing downward

But then stops short

The knife falls to the ground

A pained look washes over Wasps face BLOOD pours out of
her mouth It drips down around an OBJECT PROTRUDING from
her throat She TOPPLES over

When she hits the ground we can see what happened

Diego has thrust the KNITTING NEEDLE into the back of her
neck

A CRIMSON POOL forms around Wasps body as she chokes on her
own blood Her body spasms its last gurgled breath

Then total silence
Jamie and Diego stand there for a long moment

DIEGO
What do we do

Jamie kicks over Wasps body Now a corpse

JAMIE
We need to call the police

DIEGO
But they broke all the phones

JAMIE
Not all of them

Our angle switches to

THE FRONT ROOM
There it is Resting under Adams body
THE CELL PHONE

Untouched since his death Our angle witches back to

THE BASEMENT
The grim reality of what they have to do next sinks in

JAMIE
Dont think Just follow me

And with that she leads him up the basement stairs to
THE KITCHEN

- where Jamie emerges from the basement door knuckles
white as she grasps the hunting knife in her hand Diego

clutches onto his step-sisters arm as she moves

Jamies eyes scan the darkened room as she slowly advances
straining to see anything hidden in the shadows

But the room is empty

DIEGO
What is that

Jamies head turns and what she sees stops her cold

There is a new CENTERPIECE on the kitchen table Something
that must have been placed there for her to discover

We cant see what it is but we can hear a strange noise
coming from inside of it

Her eyes are drawn to the table

JAMIE
Dont go near it
ITS THE GARBAGE CAN FROM THE UPSTAIRS BATHROOM
Sitting there Waiting for her

JAMIE
Its for me

Jamie struggles with this cruel choice laying in front of
her

But the noise It doesnt make sense
The can rattles Slightly
There is something inside of it
JAMIE
Diego stay behind me and stand

back

Jamie moves quickly She reaches for the can and dumps the
contents out onto the kitchen table

Diego screams at what he sees
A DYING FISH His fish Gasping on the corian surface

JAMIE
Sick bastards

But thats not all Jamie sees ANOTHER OBJECT that has
dropped out of the can

A PLASTIC WHITE APPLICATOR
HER PREGNANCY TEST

DIEGO
What is it

JAMIE
Dont -- touch it

Jamie stares at the object in front of her A moment passes
Then --

Her arm quickly moves and snatches it into her hand

This is the moment

She brings the small device up to her face Her eyes take a
LONG HARD LOOK at it

We dont need to see the results Her face tells us the
answer Its positive

JAMIE IS PREGNANT
The teenager slumps onto the table and cries IT IS A MOMENT
OF PURE HEARTBREAK FOR HER How could this night have gotten

worse But somehow it has

DIEGO
Jamie please What is it

She sobs -- stops -- breathes
THEN THE CHANGE
We see it happen slowly It takes over her whole body

Jamie releases any lingering fear or panic Any caution or
doubt

Instead she becomes resolute Headstrong Determined

There are two family members to protect now And nothing is
going to get in her way

Jamie grabs Diegos hand
JAMIE
Were getting out of this house
alive And if we have to were
going to kill that other one Are
you with me
Diego nods Jamie raises the HUNTING KNIFE

JAMIE
Come on Lets go

Jamie and Diego slowly make their way to the doorway to the
Front Room

As they edge closer the heartbreaking image appears before
them

Adams body collapsed on the floor
Then they see it Under his shoulder

THE CELL PHONE

JAMIE
Whatever happens just grab it and
call 911
A nod from Diego

Before they make their move Jamie strains to look into the
room It is seemingly empty

THE TERROR APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY BAG OVER HIS FACE
WAITING

Instinct takes over and Jamie swings her knife toward the
towering figure

It is instantly batted away sending the knife gliding back
into the kitchen

Jamie grabs Diego and escapes through the kitchen GRABBING
THE KNIFE as she goes and making her way into the
FAMILY ROOM

Â» where she and her brother hide behind the FISH TANK

There the only sounds are Jamie and Diegos BREATHING and
the persistent BUBBLES from the aquarium

Their eyes look through the tank and see the bent and
distorted image of the room refracted through the glass

Then they see him

The terror Standing in the doorway -- bag draped over his
head -- hands clenched into a fist

Jamie and Diego try not to move fry not to breathe

They watch as the terror reaches his hand up towards the bag
on his head It is a terrible omen

But his arm stops when it reaches his ear

Jamie and Diego wait in anticipation for the terror to enter
the room

But he does not A moment passes and he steps out of the
doorway and exits into the front room

Jamie and her brother release a long emotional sigh of
relief
Then Diego starts to sob

JAMIE
Whats the matter

Diego is looking into the fish tank

Jamie sees what he sees

Dead fish

One VORTEXES in the bubble stream

The others lay LIFELESS on the bottom of the tank
ALL OF THEM DEAD

Jamie turns to her brother

She speaks to him forcefully

JAMIE
Look at me Listen to my words

Diego does

JAMIE
Everything thats happened up until
now doesnt matter Were getting
out of here alive and not looking
back

Jamie puts a reassuring hand on his shoulder

JAMIE
All were going to do is move
Okay
He nods
JAMIE
Were going into that room to get
that phone
DIEGO

But how do we get past him Hes
going to be right there waiting for
us

Jamie pauses to think Her brother is right She needs
plan

JAMIE
Ill draw his attention Get him
to focus on me You get to that
phone and make the call Once you
do we run Anywhere we can Back
to the basement if we have to Or
through a window Then we wait for
the cops to show up
Diego has a bleak thought Hes trying hard not to cry

DIEGO
Hes going to strangle you Jamie

Jamies mind is racing The clock is ticking She needs to
make a decision

Then she sees something Across the room

DIEGOS HOCKEY BAG Unzipped A piece of equipment crests
out from the inside

JAMIE
He cant strangle me if he cant
get anything around my neck

Diego looks where Jamie is looking

THE FRONT ROOM

Were watching from inside the front room now Adams body on
the ground

Jamie emerges framed in the doorway to the kitchen

A WHITE GOALIE MASK ON HER HEAD HUNTING KNIFE IN HER HAND
A PORTRAIT OF HORROR

Its hard to tell who the killer really is now

Diego stands behind her

Jamie speaks into the room

JAMIE
Why did you kill my parents

The terror enters into view Facing Jamie Surprised by
what he sees

TERROR
Because he told me to

JAMIE
Who did

TERROR
The voice He told me to kill
them

JAMIE

No Thereâs no voice in your head
talking to you Youâre just crazy

TERROR

The voice tells me what to do And
tells me what to say And right
now the voice wants me to see what
youll do when I strangle you

This statement sends a chill into the air

THE BAG COMES OFF -- clenched in the terrors fist as his
face remains hidden in silhouette

JAMIE
Then lets see

Jamie steps into the room -- SWINGS THE KNIFE DOWN TOWARDS
HIM

But the Terror CLENCHES HER WRIST with his powerful hand
Twists and turns her joint until the blade falls to the
ground

Then he makes his move
The Terror reaches out with his free hand -- GRASPS JAMIES

SHIRT -- HEAVES HER UP INTO THE AIR -- AND SLAMS HER AGAINST
THE WALL

The FAMILY PORTRAIT rattles next to her

JAMIE
Diego go

Diego is frozen in the kitchen doorway
An agonizing moment as Diego faces a terrifying choice

Jamies feet DANGLE off the ground as shes held in the
terrors grip

JAMIE
Diego MOVE

Diego runs over to Adams body -- grabs the phone -- flips

open

Agonizing moments pass

Then
DIEGO

Please come quick Someone broke
into our house and theyre trying
to kill us 237 old hope road
Two Three Seven Old Hope
Road Hurry

ON JAMIE

Being held in the air by the terrors outstretched arm
His BAG hangs in the other
She speaks to him from behind her mask
JAMIE

Theyre coming you bastard No

matter what you do theyre coming

now
BOOM

Terror slams her against the wall

Hope seems lost

And for the first time her eyes get a good look at the man

who is trying to kill her

And she notices --

THE CAMERA

Mounted on his shoulder And something else
Something we havent seen yet

A TWO WIRE SURVEILLANCE EARPIECE

Wedged inside his ear

CHORD SPIRALING DOWN INTO HIS CLOTHING

Confusion washes over Jamies face She struggles to break
free from the terrors grip But she cant Theres nothing

she can do

it

FROM THE POV CAMERA
As Jamie stares right into our view

JAMIE
I see your face

BOOM

Shes slammed against the wall again and our ANGLE SWITCHES

to

BEHIND THE TERROR

- where we see Diego make his way to the far corner of
room

He notices something
THE DRAWER THE ONE WITH THE JEWELRY BOX

He races over to it and reaches his hand inside When it
emerges it is clutching onto the RONSON COMET LIGHTER

The cold steel glistens in the dark room

BACK ON JAMIE
Desperate now as the terror stares at her

TERROR
Time to take off your mask

His arm slowly raises

Jamie FLAILS against the wall trying to break free Then
hand finds something

THE FAMILY PORTRAIT on the wall next to her

Her fingers grasp the frame and she SMASHES it over the
terrors forehead Glass SHATTERS

SLICING HIM OPEN
Jamie is dropped to the floor Her mask falls off

The terror releases a LOUD PIERCING YELL

the

her

Theres only one place for Jamie to run She makes a break

for THE FRONT DOOR

HER HAND
Slams onto the doorknob and twists
But it remains LOCKED

JAMIE
Dammit open

The terror is recovering now He stands SPINS toward her

BLOOD RIVULETS STREAM DOWN HIS FACE Fury spews from his
eyes

Jamie SLAMS her fists against the door desperate to make it
open

Behind her the Terror is moving his arm slowly
HE IS PLACING THE BAG BACK OVER HIS HEAD

DIEGO
Jamie hes getting the knife

Jamie spins and sees the awful figure grabbing the HUNTING
KNIFE from the ground

The terror makes his move toward the front door

Jamie is trapped in the small corridor that houses the front
door Theres nowhere to run No escape She can only
stand and face her fate

Then she hears Diegos voice

DIEGO
Jamie look at me

Her head SNAPS toward him

DIEGOS HAND
Is grasping onto the lighter

He slides it along the floor sending it RIGHT INTO JAMIES
GRASP as the terror CLOSES IN ON HER

SNAP
She clicks open the cover

PHRRRIP

She ignites the flame

WHOMP

She thrusts it onto his mask
WHHOOOSH
His head lights up Engulfed in BRIGHT ORANGE WAVES OF FIRE
THE TERROR WOBBLES BACKWARD

He tumbles onto a nearby bookshelf transferring flames onto
the home itself

ON DIEGO

Who now races over to his sister

Together they cower against the locked front door watching
the brutal image of the terror ZIG ZAGGING ACROSS THE ROOM
IN FLAMES SCREAMING as he goes

FROM OVERHEAD

The blaze spreads across the home Setting the WALLS ALIGHT

CRACKS and POPS ricochet around the burning room as the
TERROR STAGGERS into the kitchen

He ILLUMINATES THE DARK ROOM as he goes
Disappears into the family room

As the flames spread

ACROSS THE HOME

burning out cameras in each room

POP PHRRIP SWOOSH

In the

KITCHEN -- FAMILY ROOM -- BEDROOM -- BATHROOM -- BASEMENT
The cameras burn out one by one

As they do a SOUND CAN BE HEARD growing louder and louder

SIRENS

Our view switches to

THE FRONT DOOR
Â» where Jamie and Diego and are huddled together

SMOKE fills the room FLAMES rise

OUTSIDE THE HOME

Police CARS screech to a halt in front of the house
UNIFORMED OFFICERS spill out of their vehicles and race onto
the lawn

Their eyes are fixed at the horrific image in front of them

POLICEMAN
Somebody radio for fire

An OFFICER has taken cover by Matts pickup truck
His EYES notice something in the back of the truck
HE LEAPS BACKWARD AND SHOUTS
OFFICER
Holy shit we got a body here
THE FRONT DOOR

Diego and Jamie are banging the locked door now Desperate
to break it down

The NOISE OF THE ROARING FIRE fills the room

OUTSIDE THE FRONT DOOR
The policeman shouts to his partner
POLICEMAN
Get me the axe
THE FRONT ROOM

Flames rise to our last live camera in the front room Waves
of heat SMEAR our view

OUTSIDE THE FRONT DOOR

The policeman Axe in the air Readying his thrust

THE FRONT DOOR
Jamie and Diego huddle with their backs against the door as
the FLAMES are almost upon them
OUTSIDE THE FRONT DOOR
The policeman stands with his axe ready to send it swinging
downward Unbeknownst to him two innocent souls are
standing behind the door desperate to escape the burning
home
HE HEAVES IT DOWNWARD
And before itâs about to slice through the door
PHRRIP

OUR VIEW GOES COMPLETELY DARK
The camera has burned out
Moments of lingering darkness fill the screen Our view
shifts to
THE STREET
where were watching from a DAMAGED POV CAMERA
The feed cuts in and out Sharp AUDIO CLICKS and POPS are
picked up along with MOANS OF PAIN and the DEEP HEAVY
BREATHING of being on the run
WHAT WERE WATCHING IS COMING FROM THE TERRORS CAMERA
Hes escaped the home Still alive
As he runs our view bounces up and down moving through the
night moving closer and closer toward the van down the
street
For a moment OUR VIEW TURNS TO LOOK BACK and we can see
POLICE LIGHTS AND VEHICLES in front of the burning home in

distance FIRETRUCKS are now screaming toward the scene

Then our view spins back to the van and we finally approach
the door

OUTSIDE THE VAN

Two arms enter view and BANG on the sliding door
Moments pass Then --

The door of the vehicle slowly glides open Our view
switches to

INSIDE THE VAN

- where we get our first clean glimpse of the interior
from CAMERAS MOUNTED TO THE ROOF

What we see is startling
The walls of the cargo hold are completely plastered

PHOTOGRAPHS ILLUSTRATIONS AND SCHEMATICS HAVE BEEN HUNG
FROM FLOOR TO CEILING

On them images of everything weve seen so far
Jamies pregnancy test

Diegos hockey equipment

The fish tank

Jamies computer

Blueprints of the home

Photos of the family in their rooms

Lighting and electrical diagrams

Hidden camera equipment and microphone specs
Sets of house keys

EVERYTHING

Mapped out in explicit detail

And theres something else Sitting in the back of the vans
cargo area

A FIGURE WE HAVENT SEEN BEFORE

The figure is turned away from us looking down at a GLOWING
COMPUTER SCREEN mounted on a metal shelf in the van

Our view is guided toward that screen

We see it in full view Its

A CHECKERBOARD OF THE REMAINING LIVE VIDEO FEEDS
Feeds from inside the van

From the POV camera on the terror

Even some from the exterior of the home

One by one the remaining feeds start to shut down

All of them being controlled by the figure sitting in front
of that screen

This is the person who has been deciding everything weve
been seeing up until now

THIS IS THE DIRECTOR
Books and films are scattered on the ground around his feet
If you looked hard enough youâd catch the authors King

Burgess Matheson and others Perhaps his inspiration

The Director waits a moment reaches for an object on his
head then slowly slides that object down over his face

A MASK

Then his hands pull a HOOD over his head
He turns

SLOWLY

As his hooded head rotates toward our view we see the object
covering his face

Hes not wearing a mask at all
HES WEARING A MIRROR
Reflecting the image of the Terror back at us

In this reflection we see what has become of the terrors
face

IT IS NOW A GROTESQUE FORM

Plastic is melted across his burned features
A monster

TERROR
Take me to a hospital Im burned

Silence

TERROR
I did everything you told me to do

No response from the Director

TERROR
Its over Please The show is
over

Finally the Director responds His voice is the same
sinister male voice we heard in the beginning

THE DIRECTOR
Almost But youve havent
finished playing your role

He speaks directly to the POV camera Directly to US
THE DIRECTOR

This is what youve been waiting
for

There is a moment of stunned silence The terror doesn

know how to respond

TERROR
What are you talking about

He doesnt realize the Director isnt talking to him

THE DIRECTOR
This is what you came to see

TERROR
You need to take me to a hospital
You need to get me help

THE DIRECTOR
(to the terror now)
But I cant until I give them what

they want

TERROR
What do you what what who
wants

t

The Director raises a gun and aims it right at the terror

Right at us

TERROR
Hey Hey What is this

BOOM
Our POV falls to the ground Were left with an angled view
of the van from below as the microphone picks up the terrors

MOANING and GURGLING

THE DIRECTOR
This is the end

Gasoline is doused directly toward us The fluid SPLASHES
onto the camera

A spark ignites from the Directors hand
A MATCH -- reflected in the mirror that covers his face
HE FLICKS THE MATCH DIRECTLY AT OUR POV

After a moment FLAMES RISE up into view Hes burning the
body

The van door SLAMS shut
PHRRIP

THE CAMERA GOES BLACK And our view switches to

HE STREET

where were watching from a camera mounted on the back
of the van -- driving away from a BURNING CORPSE on the
street and a BURNING HOME in the distance

THE DIRECTOR (VO)
Lets talk you and I Lets talk
about fear Allowing ourselves to
experience something truly
terrifying gives us an opportunity
to drag our fears out of the
darkness To examine them and come
to terms with them Thats the
great appeal of what I have given
you tonight A rehearsal for your
own death

(then)
Now thereâs no reason to be afraid

There is movement and commotion on the front lawn

THE DIRECTOR (VO)

Jamie Diego When you see what

youve accomplished youll be so

proud
As the image gets further and further away we can make out
TWO FIGURES being PULLED from the front of the home
embracing each other Jamie and Diego Firemen try to wrap
each of them in a blanket
But they refuse to separate Instead they share one
A song begins to play from the radio in the van

RADIO

Oh the bulldog on the bank

And the bullfrog in the pool

The bulldog called the bullfrog

A green old water fool

Singing tra la la la la la la

The audio fades away as we

FADE TO

A BLACK SCREEN
Moments pass Then a voice begins to speak to us
We recognize it as the Director

THE DIRECTOR
Are you watching

A DIM SQAURE Appears in the upper left corner of the screen
Were watching a live video feed of an empty room

A different room

IN A DIFFERENT HOME

VOICE
Good

CUT TO BLACK
