The disease is commonly referred to

INT WAITING ROOM DAY -- SIMULTANEOUS 24

PATRICK CHANDLER 7 is watching TV with an 18 YEAR-OLD
BABYSITTER Two WOMEN VISITORS are chatting as he watches

DR BETHENY (VO)
Its a gradual deterioration of the
muscles of the heart It’s usually
associated with older people but
in rarer cases it will occur ina
younger person

INT HOSPITAL - JOE’S ROOM CONTINUOUS 25

DR BETHENY
Some people can live as long as
fifty or sixty years with just an
occasional attack But most people
suffer periodic episodes like the
one you had on Monday which mimic
the symptoms of a heart attack and
which further weaken the muscle
They can put you out of commission
for a week two weeks

(MORE)
DR BETHENY (CONTD)
And you’1l need to be hospitalized
so we can monitor your heart
because the risk of cardiac arrest
is elevated for a week or two

ELISE
Oh my God
STAN
(Pats her hand)
OKOK
DR BETHENY

But in between these episodes most
people feel perfectly healthy and
you can basically live a normal
life

JOE
SoWhat do you mean that some
people live as long as fifty or
sixty years You mean total Or
from when theyre diagnosed with
this or what

DR BETHENY
Total

Everyone is stunned into silence even Elise

DR BETHENY (CONT’D)
For approximately eighty percent of
patients your age the most common
statistical life expectancy is five
years or less

Elise grips Stan’s hand Lee looks at the floor

JOE
Wow

DR BETHENY
But the statistics vary widely and
they’re just statistics You’re not
a statistic you’re just one
person and we dont know what’s
going to happen to you yet But
it’s not a good disease

JOE
What’s a good disease

DR BETHENY
Poison Ivy

He

ELISE
(Rising)

in this situation

STAN
Elise you must calm down

1ST DETECTIVE

OK
LEE
Which -- is not the usual for me
but
FIRE MARSHALL
Go on

LEE
Anyway our bedroom’s in the
downstairs The girls sleep
upstairs So Randi makes everybody
leave around two o’clock maybe
three AM and she went back to bed
So everybody leaves and I go
inside And it’s really cold
inside so I go check on the girls
and it’s fuckin’ freezing up there
We sleep downstairs The girls
sleep in the upstairs But Randi
doesn’t like the central heat
because it dries her out her
sinuses and she gets these
headaches So I went downstairs and
built a fire in the fireplace and
I sit down to watch TV except
there’s no more beer And I’m still
jumpin’ like a jackrabbit So I put
a couple big logs on the fire so
the house would warm up when I was
gone and I went to the mini-
martIt’s about a fifteen minute
walk both ways But I didn’t wanna
drive cause I was really wasted
And I’m halfway there and I
remember I didn’t put the screen
back on the fireplace But I figure
it’s probably OK

floor when I was gone The girls
were all upstairsAnd that’s it
The firemen got Randi out She was
passed out downstairs And then
they said the furnace blew and
they couldn’t go inside again And
that’s all I remember

Anyway I’m pretty sure you can’t
use heavy equipment in the Central
Cemetary

Because there’s a lot of important
people buried there and their
desecendents don’t want a steam
shovel vibratin’ over their dead
bodies How do I know
