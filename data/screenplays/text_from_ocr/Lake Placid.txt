OVER BLACK we HEAR the distant but near melodic CRY of a LOON

SLOWLY FADE IN TO

EXT BLACK LAKE - NIGHT

The loon continues its hypnotic call as the steamy mist lifts
off the dark water which doesnt even ripple The loon
continues her nocturnal cry as we savor the beauty of the lake
the elegance of the bird and the haunting echo of her lonely
call until suddenly the bird is crisply pulled under
silenced forever A lone feather surfaces and floats as

Credits roll over the black lake to Richie Havens singing I CAN
SEE CLEARLY NOW Then--

OVER BLACK

KEOUGH (0S)
And they pay you for this To tag
beaver

WALT (0S)
Imagine

As we FADE IN a face COMES INTO FOCUS from underwater It is
the face of WALT LAWSON (Maine Fish And Game) looking down from
a boat

EXT LAKE - DAY

Next to him is SHERIFF HANK KEOUGH paunch disposition of an
untipped waiter

KEOUGH
Ask me what an animal does in the
wild is his own business so long as
he doesnt do it to man I think
Mark Twain said that

WALT
(dry)
I think he didnt But since
youve said it I guess were
covered

Keough holds a stare Walt drops overboard Keough pulls a
Twinkie from his pocket Begins to unwrap

kicking

HIS EYES FOCUS
A black water snake it must be almost three feet in length

Walt flippers himself closer wants a closer look The snake
seems unimpressed Then suddenly the snake lunges at him
misses Shit Walts look says what the fuck A beat Then
the snake swims off Walt relaxes A beat But then he
looks around uneasy He gets this feeling hes not alone down
there Looks about nothing but murky water But hes not
alone we can feel hes not alone

He looks left right then four snakes swimming hovering
looking back at him Whats with these snakes Walt decides
hell go back to the boat Then BOOM Something hits him

Upon which Walt surfaces He swims frantically for a beat
before hes suddenly yanked under again Then he surfaces
thrashing as Keough speeds over with the boat He takes hold of
him and pulls him on board Actually whats left of him

KEOUGH
Sorry Im just a little unclear
as to why the Museum of Natural
History would send somebody here

KELLY
You have a thing against museums

KEOUGH
I got nothing against--

KELLY
Ever even been in one

He stares back Then picks up a huge cannon-like gun As he
loads it--

KELLY

shot with this and hes dead

KELLY
(incredulous)
And you stock these things for

Suddenly like a shot Kellys arm jerks up as she jet sprays a
white fog from a can of Yard Guard Keough holds a look at her

Kelly Scott

JACK
Jack Wells A museum sent you

KELLY
Are we all museum bigots in Maine

Jack holds a look decides to let that pass

JACK
Did you make anything of the tooth

KELLY
Yes it did seem prehistoric but
Im sure he just carried the thing
for luck Not that it worked
obviously It probably somehow got
lodged into his body

Jack holds another look

KELLY (CONTD)
Why are you staring at me
(to Keough)
Do I have a smudge on my face it
would be so you not to have told
me

Keough also lets that pass

KEOUGH
(to Jack)
Im ready when you are

JACK
Lets go

As they start out Kelly grabs Jack by the arm

KELLY
Excuse me One other thing its
a small point but I have a

thing about being humored and Im
feeling humored more by him but
you seemed quick to join in

JACK
Maam your first impression isnt
going well

As JANINE POST sixteen flirtatious little vixen steps up

JANINE
Excuse me Is it true youre going
to look for some kind of monster in
Black Lake

KEOUGH
Were just going to investigate an
accident Theres no monster

JANINE
We heard a man got bit in half

KEOUGH

JACK
You killed him

BICKERMAN
(happily)
Oh yes
KEOUGH

And how would you have accomplished
this Maam

BICKERMAN

(rattling it off quickly

simply)
Well he was very ill and he
refused to go see a doctor and
well I think he had Alzheimers
he would be coherent one day
incoherent the next and one
coherent day he asked me to end
his suffering I wouldnt do it
but he kept insisting and insisting
and deteriorating till the point
the only cognitive thing he could
really do was that I finish him
off Finally I just gave in and
hit him on the head with a skillet
then buried him under the bulkhead

Jack Keough and Kelly just stare back at this crazy woman
Off their looks--

BICKERMAN (CONTD)
(to Keough)
Dig him up if you dont believe me

like a branch He lifts it up revealing it to be an antler
Connected to the severed head of a moose Keough seeing it as
he lifts it screams throwing it

It hits Kelly and she screams a blood-curdling scream as the
HEAD hits the floor of the boat with a HEAVY THUD Kelly rears

Did she tell you we had sex
together

KELLY
I never had sex with you

HECTOR
Even so youre allowed to boast
You look thin by the way Ive
mentally undressed you I can see
your ribcage

KEOUGH
I really dont mean to be
discourteous
(patronizing)
But how is it a person could come
to believe that a crocodile is in
New England
HECTOR
They have saltwater glands they
can swim across oceans its only
a matter of time

KEOUGH
And what would he do come winter

HECTOR
They can survive winter As long
as their nostrils dont freeze
they survive
(to Kelly)
am I foolish to explain things he
had such trouble with my name

KELLY KEOUGH
(scolding) Hey
Hector
HECTOR
(to Keough)

Is this where it happened

KEOUGH
Around here Yeah

HECTOR
(knows his crocodiles)
If hes eaten in the area he
shouldnt be far away Crocs hang
around the food source

KELLY
But theyre nighttime hunters
Hector hed probably be on land
now anyway

HECTOR
Cept he wasnt before was he
(then to Keough)

You know when friends or family
members say things they tend not
to register so sometimes it helps
to hear it from a total stranger
Youre fat

feet away

JACK

KEOUGH

Upon which something grabs the front of Kellys canoe and with
one crisp yank flips it over like a spoon on a dinner table
sending them all flying

shipped off

And her face falls

KELLY
(wounded quietly)
That was an awful thing to say to
me

JACK
(feels bad now)
Im sorry but youre

A beat He doesnt finish the sentence

KELLY
(genuine)
I do know crocodiles and I wont
get in your way

Jack reads her he can see that she does

JACK
Okay

KELLY

JACK

Night

Theres a little chemistry here though both would probably deny
it He heads off toward his tent she sits with her book She
gives one last look watches him go Then she goes back to her
book
DISSOLVE TO

EXT LAKE - MUCH LATER

The lake is still the campfire is out the tents are quiet
The quiet SOUNDS of NIGHT CRICKETS A LOON An OWL A
courageous raccoon looks about seeing what he can rummage By
the water a black bear takes a drink

ANGLE KEOUGHS TENT

He emerges compelled by a full bladder wearing only his
trousers carrying a revolver He walks into the nearby woods
He removes from his shorts his bladders connection to the
outside world Proceeds to URINATE Then he hears
something The SOUND of RUSTLING LEAVES He STOPS URINATING
we HEAR a HALF SECOND of MOVEMENT Then quiet Must be his
imagination He RESUMES his business

More RUSTLING its not just the sound of dense urine against
leaves he stops somethings out there in the darkness
Quiet He starts up for a second STOPS QUICKLY and we HEAR it
for sure Somethings RUSTLING TOWARDS him With his free
hand Keough pulls out his revolver More RUSTLING Keough
points the gun Something on the ground is coming toward him
He moves slowly gun drawn into the darkness The RUSTLING is
getting LOUDER Its almost upon him A beat CLOSER

CLOSER Then Keough peels away a bush revealing

HECTOR
Looking into a gun barrel He screams Keough screams Then--

HECTOR
Jesus Christ

KEOUGH
What the hell are you doing

HECTOR
What are you doing

KEOUGH
Youre crawling around like a--

HECTOR
Im laying a spring trap

KEOUGH
A spring trap

HECTOR
I keep telling you they can come
on land I dont wanna wake up in
the middle of the night--
KEOUGH
I coulda shot you you--

HECTOR
This could end up saving your life--

HECTOR (CONTD) KEOUGH
Youll be glad you didnt Hey look Im sure you
shoot me then youll be finished first in your
tongue massaging my class but I think you need
hemorrhoids just before to be retired to the big rubber
running off to get your room where you can play with
sister pregnant who you soft stuffed reptiles

probably already call mom
And now all the others awakened are charging

KELLY
(arriving)
Hey What is going on

HECTOR KEOUGH
This man takes a pistol Hes crawling around--
to pee

KEOUGH (CONTD)
(escalating)
This is an official investigation
and this cuckoo bird is a civilian
I dont care how much money hes
got hes a total mental

And Hector storms off A beat
KELLY

You hurt his feelings I think you
should go apologize

KEOUGH
Apologize
KELLY KEOUGH (CONTD)
Were a team here It Hes a fruitcake
wont kill you to get
along
KELLY (CONTD)
Look The thing about Hector he
takes this crocodile business
very
(how to say it)
he thinks theyre Godly
A beat

JACK
He thinks theyre what
KELLY
In his defense every primitive
culture known to man deified them
Hes a mythology professor he
thinks crocs are divine conduits

KEOUGH
Is this spose to make me take him
more serious

KELLY
Its to make you understand him
with understanding comes tolerance
Too bad they dont put proverbs in
Twinkies my load would be lighter

KEOUGH
(befuddled)
Why does everybody insult my
intelligence I have intelligence
intelligent people eat Twinkies

KELLY
Im sorry

Keough shoots a look to Jack

JACK
Lets just all get some sleep

And Keough heads off under--

KEOUGH
Im an intelligent person

Upon which he disappears from Earth Hes stepped into one
Hectors pit traps A beat

KEOUGH (0S)
(calmly)
I shall kill him

DISSOLVE TO

EXT LAKE - SUNRISE

The steam is lifting off the lake

EXT LAKE - MORNING

Keough Kelly Hector and Deputy Burke are cruising in the
whaler Hector and Jack are both in full diving gear Jack
also has a stick gun for protection Hector does not

of
KEOUGH

Again I dont mean to be annoying
with my questions But if it is a
crocodile which I dont think it
is And if they do charge these
baby hatchling sounds

(to Jack)
why exactly would you want to be
underwater at the time

(to Hector)
With you it makes sense

HECTOR
They dont really attack underwater
and--

KEOUGH

That Walt guy got hit underwater--

HECTOR
No crocodile has ever--

KELLY
(to Hector)
You should take a flax pole

HECTOR
And what if I tranq him Kelly He
drowns You think about that

KELLY
Im just saying last resort

KEOUGH
Again Not to be disruptive Do
we have a problem with it dying

HECTOR
Crocodiles dont sever with their
teeth their molars are blunt

As if thats suppose to clear it up Keough stares back
blankly Then

KEOUGH
Is this a trick

HECTOR
What Im saying is if its a
crocodile that cut a man in half he
would have to be over twenty feet
which would make him well over a
hundred years old it would be
unthinkable to destroy him

JACK
(to Burke)
Alright lets just drop here

Burke lowers the anchor as Keough just continues to stare at
Hector Kelly readies the hatchling recorder She lowers it
into the water

KELLY
They respond pretty quick Ill
wait till you get down before I
turn it on

JACK
Good
(climbing over)
See ya soon

KELLY
Good luck

There was a twinge of real concern in her voice He makes eye
contact with her Then drops over Goes under

HECTOR
(to Kelly)
Two years married divorced used
to be a lawyer quit Im still
waiting on his sperm count

KELLY
What
(off Hectors look)
Oh as if Im interested

HECTOR
As if
(as hes about to go
overboard to Keough)
Will you miss me

KEOUGH
(to Hector)
I brought a pork chop maybe we
could hang it around your neck for
luck

HECTOR
No thank you but maybe later you
can chew the bark off my big fat
log

And Hector drops overboard
KEOUGH
(to Kelly)

Was that like a homo-sexual remark

KELLY
(strict)
I asked you to be nice to him

Keough rolls his eyes

KELLY (CONTD)
What was that

KEOUGH
I dont know It was like a tug
Something tugged us

Upon which something really yanks the boat So hard

And finally as he severs the rope the boat almost goes airborne
with a jump Burke nearly sails out Keoughs boat then races
to Kelly

ANGLE KELLY

KELLY
Hurry up

Suddenly about thirty feet away we SEE fish breaking water

KELLY (CONTD)
Shit Hank

The boat is zooming toward her It arrives As Keough and
Burke go to pull her aboard we see a dark shadow rising

BURKE
(screaming)
Look out

And Jack explodes out of the water it was his shadow Keough
and Burke pull them both aboard

KEOUGH
(back to Kelly)
Are you alright

KELLY

Slowly moving in
Deputy Burke at the end of the boat

Hector If only he knew what hes not

hangs over the boat Kelly screams in

In a microsecond Burkes

Theyre now in the water right below Burkes head

CuT TO

EXT CAMPSITE - SUNSET

Burkes body is being loaded into an ambulance People move in
silence the wake of tragedy A few State Troopers are on the
scene

KEOUGH
(giving a statement)
Nobody actually saw it It
happened sudden

PAN TO FIND Kelly staring almost blankly as Jack finishing a
phone call approaches He measures her expression shes still
in shock

JACK
You okay
(nothing)
Kelly

KELLY
Yeah
(then)
Nobody saw anything

JACK
No
(then)
US Wildlife is on their way

KELLY
Thats probably good

JACK
Police want to keep it quiet if
the press gets word lake
monster They just want us to sit

tight
ANGLE KELLY

She is visibly undone she appears almost to be fighting off
shock Jack puts his hands on her shoulder to steady her

JACK
Are you okay

KELLY

Um yknow

(swallows)
Yeah
Jack can see shes willing herself to be stoic

JACK
A man died You dont have to be
so tough

She nods appreciatively Part of her would love to collapse
into him but a bigger part demands that she remain stoic

KELLY
Im fine I uh Im fine

PAN TO FIND Keough walking Still visibly shaken He
unwittingly approaches Hector They hold a look

HECTOR
(genuine)
Im sorry

A beat

HECTOR (CONTD)
Was he a good man

KEOUGH
Yup

HECTOR
Whenever somebody dies I consider
it such a waste that I didnt know
him better

A beat Then--

KEOUGH
(fighting off disbelief
shock maybe)
His head was just bitten off

HECTOR
(sadly)
I used to have this recurring
nightmare that I was headless

Keough turns to stare at him with incredulity

HECTOR (CONTD)

(quietly rattling it off)
Id be on the ground looking up at
my body no head walking around
bumping into everything And my
parents wouldnt let me in the
house cause theyd just bought all
these new antique lamps and they
were afraid Id knock them over
made sense and meanwhile the
neighborhood bullies would see my
round little head on the ground
looking like a ball and theyd
come rushing over to start up a
game of soccer Id actually feel
grateful just for being allowed
into the contest thats esteem for
you what are your thoughts

Keough has had enough of this guy

KEOUGH
(a powder keg)
You know Hector Im sure youre
a fine person in your own mental
way But I think it would be best
if you and I didnt speak

And Keough heads off He takes about four steps then SNAP
Up goes his upside-down body like a rocket Hes stepped in
Hectors spring-bow trap A beat He swings upside-down like
a pendulum Another beat

HECTOR
This is a setback

KEOUGH
You dont want to cut me down
Cause Ill kill you

CuT TO

EXT BEACH - NIGHT
Kelly and Jack

KELLY
Hard to believe there could be a
monster under such peacefulness

JACK
I thought I might track the
shoreline tomorrow look for
prints

She just stares out as if she didnt hear And he fixes his own
stare on her Feeling it she turns catches him looking at
her he diverts the stare She feigns a non-reaction A beat

JACK (CONTD)
You know they say the brain

confuses fear for passion

KELLY
Excuse me

JACK
When you get scared the brain
releases a chemical same chemical
it releases when somebodys

(a beat)
in high school the thing to do was
to take the girl to a scary movie

KELLY
What are you talking about

JACK
Im saying between the moonlight
a beautiful lake and a monster that
bites heads off you look good

KELLY
Gee that was so poetic Jack Im
all moist

JACK
Forgive me for trying to be nice

KELLY
Nice Nice would be you look
pretty nice is not some man-
eating monster has tricked my brain
into making you look good

JACK
I didnt say it like that

KELLY
You did you--

JACK
I was trying to pay you a
compliment I was guising it as
science cause I know youre
comfortable in that arena
Science

KELLY
A man just died youre hitting on
me with science

JACK
Just forget it

HECTOR
(arriving)
Beg pardon Sorry to intrude but
Hank seems to have gotten himself
stuck in a tree

EXT CAMPSITE - SECONDS LATER
Hank hangs still upside down from the tree as Hector Kelly
and Jack approach

HECTOR
I probably couldve accomplished
freeing him myself but he had a
look of mayhem on his upside down
face

They arrive Hank says nothing he hangs there perfectly

The three

KELLY
Hank

KEOUGH
(calmly)
Yes

exchange looks

KELLY
Are you okay

KEOUGH
(calmly almost sweet)
Other than feeling slightly
embarrassed Im perfectly fine
(then)
Could you cut me down

HECTOR
Promise you wont kill me first

KEOUGH
(calmly)
I have no interest in ever looking
at you Hector
(again)
Could you please cut me down

Jack gives Kelly a knife

JACK
You cut well hold him

still

Hector and Jack grab hold Kelly cuts they lower him to the

ground

He rises

KEOUGH
(calm)
Thank you

(then)
I lied

And he charges after Hector who runs toward the beach Keough
chases Jack and Kelly pursue trying to stop him And

suddenly

exploding out of the woods a ferocious charging
GROWL An attack Screams all over a half-second of confusion
before we SEE its a large BLACK BEAR jumping out of the
darkness right at Hector Hector dives out of its path
Screams panic shouting as the bear rears up on his hind legs
Seemingly about to lunge when exploding out of the water

the giant jaws of a crocodile

In a flash instant the beast engulfs the bear twisting it
slamming it on the ground and then pulling it into the water

The bear fights back ferociously for a second but there can only
be one outcome here In a matter of seconds both bear and
crocodile have vanished And the water is calm again

ANGLE THE FACES

Utter catatonia Shock Whatever they expected to find in this
expedition they werent remote prepared for that There are

no words here Shock is pre-empting every other human sensory

What they just saw a crocodile head measuring five feet rise

up out of the water and gobbled a fucking bear A beat Then--

KEOUGH
(admitting)
Okay Its a crocodile Ill
admit it

A beat as they gulp air

KELLY
(to Jack)
Youre cut

There is a little blood over Jacks right eye He dabs it

KELLY (CONTD)
(to Hector)
He was an Indo-pacific

HECTOR
(daunted)
Are you sure

KELLY
Scales were oval It was an Asian
crocodile

KEOUGH
Asia How how could he get
here

HECTOR

Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong
flushed him down a toilet

KELLY
He had to be thirty feet long
Another beat

JACK

(charged)
Hank The little cannon you
brought get it Guard the

shoreline Otherwise were done
We made the ID our job is
finished

KEOUGH

Alright Ms Paleontologist I
wanna know why that monster is
here You got a theory

KELLY
Why hes that big I dont know
Why hes here the wetlands are

being developed crocodiles are
moving Australia Fiji the
things have started to cross
oceans

JACK
But why Maine and why alone Crocs
are social whys this guy on the
move by himself

HECTOR
Maybe he doesnt play well with
others

KEOUGH
Is everything a big fucking joke to
you

HECTOR

(re his groin)
Bite my bishop

And Keough starts for him but Jack intercedes

KEOUGH
Im sick of him

JACK HECTOR

(interceding) Let him go Im sick of you

Cmon

(then)
Thing about being rich Sheriff
my parents had the added luxury of
being able to ditch me off at Karate
school Im a brown belt So go
ahead Take your best shot

Keough throws a haymaker decking Hector Lays him out
KELLY
Hank

KEOUGH
(who knew)
He said he knew Karate

HECTOR
(shaken)
At school theyd always say go

JACK
(to Keough)
Get your big gun and guard the
shore Hector Go to your tent

HECTOR
(muttering as he goes)
He never said go

JACK
(to Keough)
Get the gun

KEOUGH
(muttering as he goes)
If I fall into a hole or get
hoisted into a tree

And hes gone

JACK
(re Keough and Hector)
Like little children
(then)
You okay

KELLY
Yeah I got some stuff for your
cut

JACK
I couldnt believe did you see

the size of that things mouth

KELLY
I wonder if hes some kind of
mutant
(then)
That bear had to be surprised

JACK
(taking her arm ushering)
Lets get away from the shore
She looks at his hand on her arm which suddenly makes him self-
consious

JACK (CONTD)
Sorry

KELLY
Its okay

They hold a look

EXT LAKE (WESTSIDE) - NIGHT

We are at a small clearing on the other side of the lake A
four-wheel-drive of some sort is bumping down a fairly
unpassable dirt road into the clearing

TOM (0S)
Told you I could make it

As the jeep comes more INTO VIEW we REVEAL its occupants to be
six teenagers including Janine and TOM STEVE DANNY CAROL
ELLEN Theyve been drinking but theyre not sloppy drunk As
they climb out Tom points to a swing rope which extends from
the branch of a tree that overhangs the water

Jack nods slightly

KELLY (CONTD)

This is the first time Ive

middle of anything Ive never
really even gotten dirty before
with me showers have always been
preventative

Their eyes are locked now making her self-conscious and
nervous

JACK
Thats why youre here To get in

KELLY
Maybe Ive always read about

know it sounds silly but its nice
to be someplace while something is
actually yknow happening

Something is happening right now A beat

KELLY (CONTD)
We should probably go to bed
(quickly)
Get rest get some rest Go to our
separate beds get some rest

The Freudian slip of her life They hold another look Then he
starts to exit He stops at the door turns back

JACK

KELLY

He holds another look then leaves OFF her punishing herself
for both the slip of the tongue and for cutting the moment

short

flirtatious time As they splash and frolic and cop their

the surface followed by the snout GO TO

THE CROCS POV

Six fresh delicious teenagers Midnight buffet

RESUME
the croc as he slowly starts to move The teenagers start to

take turns swinging on a rope from a branch which overhangs the
shoreline As they laugh and yell Danny swings on a long

rope landing with a splash About ten feet from the croc
waiting stealth-like his eyes barely above surface He could
easily go for Danny but he somehow knows the service will get

better As Danny swims back to shore Janine takes hold of the
rope

JANINE
Here I come Ready or not

And she swings away a better swing than Dannys and she

splashes down about five feet from the eyes Again the eyes

dont move The teenagers cheer Janines record-setting swing
as Tom takes hold of the rope

STEVE
All or nothing Tom

TOM
From the jaws of defeat

And he flies away Its a leap to die for As he splashes
down gulp Like a seal grabbing a fish and Tommy has
vanished The kids cheering at the leap stop cheering when
Tommy fails to resurface A beat They first think hes
playing a joke

STEVE
Ha ha

Another beat Still no sign of Tommy

JANINE

This isnt funny Tommy
And now theyre concerned They all move down toward the shore

Look ten feet into the water

RESUME

Kelly Jack and Keough as they lower their scopes They look
at each other then back at the foregoing

EXT BICKERMAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Mrs Bickerman singing Itsy Bitsy Spider is happily leading

the blinded cow to the shore The cow tentative just allows

itself to be led not knowing what the plan is As Mrs

Bickerman gets to the water she looks out to the croc

BICKERMAN
Come and get it

And with that she whips the hind of the cow causing it to jump
forward Almost simultaneously the croc makes its charge and

the cow is dead before it has a clue

INT BICKERMAN HOUSE - DAY

Keough Kelly and Jack are questioning a slightly hostile Mrs
Bickerman
BICKERMAN
(indignant)
I havent broken any laws

KEOUGH

(bordering on

condescension)
Oh but you have Maam You lied
to us that could be obstruction of
justice A mans been killed in
part cause of your silence I
could make out a charge of reckless
endangerment and Im sure PETA
would be annoyed at how you treat
your cows

BICKERMAN
The reason I lied is if Id told
you the truth youd just hunt it
down and kill it which seems to be
exactly what youre doing

KELLY
How long have you been feeding this
thing

BICKERMAN
About six years He first appeared
in May of nineteen-ninety-one
Bernie was out fishing and it
followed him home So we threw him
some scraps and well he didnt
seem to bother anybody He became
kind of like a pet who lived in the
wild

JACK
He just appeared You have no idea
how he arrived in this lake

BICKERMAN
No Do you

KEOUGH
Maam Your husband Bernie You
didnt by any chance lead him to
the lake blindfolded

BICKERMAN
(offended)
No I did not
(then)
The crocodile did kill him though
But it was all it was a mistake
KELLY

A mistake
BICKERMAN

One of our horses got loose two
years ago went to the lake to
drink and well the crocodile
started coming in Bernie went to
intercede and it was alla
terrible misunderstanding

(then)
If I reported it they wouldve
sent people to kill it

Keough Kelly and Jack cant quite believe what theyre hearing
Then--

KEOUGH
Maam how could you not report
this He puts human life at risk
and--

BICKERMAN

Nobody lives on this lake its
really his lake now

EXT LAKE - CONTINUOUS

The chopper free-floating is drifting near a small cove
Hector in diving gear is about to go into the water as Gare
tries to dissuade

GARE
(getting panicked)
Cmon Hector I know youre crazy
but you cant--

HECTOR
I need to see his habitat

As he drops in

GARE
Please Ill have sex with you
anything but get out of the water

HECTOR
Hes not gonna hurt me

(into walkie-talkie)
What problem

GARE (0S)

(through walkie-talkie)
He went swimming

CuT TO

EXT LAKE - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

Hector is underwater exploring

ANGLE GARE ON THE CHOPPER

Her radar is up she heard something But she doesnt see
anything She scans the surface closely

EXT LAKE - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

The water is slightly more visible as Hector swims Other than
the odd school of fish an otter a snapping turtle nothing
extraordinary Then a flash shadow looms over him He looks
up but sees nothing Probably just the sun ducking under a
cloud It does make him sufficiently nervous however to head
for the surface He swims upward

EXT LAKE (SURFACE) - CONTINUOUS

Hector breaks the top Lifts his mask looks toward the
chopper which he sees about forty yards out He continues to
breaststroke on the surface Suddenly the crocs head rises
up right behind Hector whos oblivious He continues to swim
The croc follows Then maybe divine intuition Hector gets
a feeling hes being followed He then turns to look the other
way upon which his face goes rigid

HIS POV

About three feet from his nose are two giant eyes staring at
him

ANGLE HECTOR
ashen

HECTOR
(weakly)
Oh my

The croc doesnt move It just stares at him Then end of his
snout is almost touching Hector Hector himself doesnt dare
move for fear of spooking the croc into action We get the
idea that looking into the eyes of this crocodile is not filling
any spiritual voids A beat

HECTOR (CONTD)
I suddenly feel a bit foolish
(then)
Youre different from the others

The croc raises his head now to reveal the snout And his
deadly smile Hector just tries to tread water with as little
motion as possible He deathly fears a quick movement will
cause his life to be over Perhaps this is what he came for
To be judged by this symbol of mythology

He backswims ever so slightly The croc pursues just as slowly
their eyes are locked He could snap off Hectors head in an
instant

HECTOR (CONTD)
(terrified trying to
convince himself

Holy spirit of Sobek Holy ghost
(swallows)
Holy shit

CuT TO

INT SEA CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

Gare still scans the waters surface looking for any sign of
Hector And her face freezes Oh yes theres the sign

HER POV

Hector continues to backswim slowly to the plane and the croc
slowly follows
GARE
Hector

We can hear the quaking fear in Hectors voice As he continues
to slowly backswim

HECTOR
(to Gare forced calm)
Just turn the ignition its fuel
injected

Gare turns the ignition the ENGINE KICKS and DIES

GARE
Come on

She turns it again and the ENGINE TURNS OVER

ANGLE HECTOR

The crocodile is still right with him as they inch closer and
closer toward the chopper

HECTOR
I know under the circumstances
biting off my head might seem
viable It would cheapen you

But nothings funny about this to Hector now What hes staring
into is death His own Gare raises her rifle

GARE
I might get a shot

HECTOR

(fear in his voice)
No If you dont kill him
instantly Im dead and youll only
kill him instantly if you get his
brain which is about the size of
a cherry And even if you were on
target a bullet might not
penetrate his hide

ANGLE GARE

GARE
(re the croc)
Jesus
(to Hector)
About twelve more yards Keep
coming just like that

ANGLE HECTOR

craning to see how far away he is and as soon as he breaks eye
contact with the CROCODILE it GROWLS Hector quickly locks
eyes with him again
ANGLE GARE

GARE
(weakly)
Oh my God

RESUME

By now Hector is almost to the chopper the croc is right there
too Hectors right hand then goes slowly for his belt though
its impossible to discern why The crocodile seems poised to
finish him Theres a slight GROWL

And then suddenly a small underwater POP followed by an
EXPLOSION out of the water its an inflatable life vest and as
it pop tarts out of the water the croc lunges for it

As the croc goes for the vest Hector makes his dash for the
chopper In almost an instant hes climbing on board as the
croc pulls the vest into darkness underwater

Hectors up on the choppers ski

HECTOR
Move over

The crocodiles head comes thrusting up its massive jaws
snapping shut missing Hector by an inch maybe two Hector
dives into the chopper screaming

GARE
Go

She REVS the CHOPPER The croc comes up again chomping down on
one of the landing skis Both Gare and Hector scream as the
whole helicopter is jerked mightily

GARE (CONTD)
(screaming)
Go

HECTOR
Im trying

The croc releases and the chopper rights itself and begins to
thrust off when the croc surfaces again mouth open Gare
FIRES her REVOLVER It might as well shoot BBs The croc is
undaunted but he does miss the ski and by now the chopper is up
and running finally safely out of the reptiles reach

divine suicide

KELLY
Alright Jack

JACK
No

What you just did there was at
least some sort of a death wish
going on
HECTOR

Nothings real

KELLY
Excuse me

Im rich people are automatically
my friends sycophants ooze out
like oil slicks and and and--

Hes sounding erratic

HECTOR (CONTD)

robbed me of the dream in life I
sit here broken a hollow sack--

KELLY
Oh bullshit

And Hector drops the act

HECTOR
Didnt even sound good

KELLY
No

HECTOR
(worth a try)

JACK
Just heard from Wildlife and
Florida Fish And Game They should
be here by four

KELLY
Okay

JACK
We might as well pack

KELLY
Good idea
They turn

HECTOR (0S)
Theyll kill him

to see Hector is standing there

HECTOR

Theyre not going to be able to
snag him in pitmans Trang him in
water he drowns

KELLY
They could try to trang him on
land

HECTOR
(knowing)
They wont Hes taken human life
the mission will be to put him
down

KEOUGH
Gee that would really disappoint
me

HECTOR
Forget about him being God hes
thirty feet long he is a miracle
of nature who somehow made his way
to Maine This is a grand beast
A grand dragon An attempt should
at least be made to capture him
alive

JACK
Well you can try talking them into
that if--

HECTOR
I have enough flaxedil with me to
put him out And I think I know a
way to--

JACK
Forget it

HECTOR
Look I know Im crazy but when
they come they will kill it They
have to politically hes too
dangerous if something were to go
wrong the odds are he will be
destroyed --

KEOUGH HECTOR (CONTD)

Which is exactly Please Hank let me finish

what

Im having a sane moment

this
is a window

HECTOR (CONTD)
If he were neutralized when they
got here they might consider
saving him

KELLY
And how would we neutralize him

HECTOR
We lure him on land and pump him
with the drugs

JACK
No way

HECTOR
Jack Weve all seen it Hes
probably a hundred and fifty years
old hes bigger than an elephant

Hectors impassioned here hes not fooling around

JACK
So maybe Wildlife will try to save
him theyre more equipped to--

HECTOR
We both know what theyll do

Silence Admission by silence Then--

JACK
Even if we could trang him-- how
would we get him on land

KEOUGH
Other than to eat us

HECTOR
He follows anything that moves
You guys can be in the trucks with
tranq guns If he charges drive
off plus Hank youve got your hand-
held cannon We could do this with
no safety risk If it works we
save a beast that should be saved

(looking through binocs
Nothing Maybe he swam out

Upon which the croc comes thrusting up out of the water charging

JACK
Go Drive

The pick-up spins dirt lurches forward throwing Keough off
balance The croc heads back for the water as Keough regains
his balance

JACK (CONTD)
Take him

And Keough blasts It detonates the ground near the croc
causing him to surge airborne into the water And he goes
under Silence A beat

Hank
And as Hector looks further Behind him up surfaces the

crocodile in all his stealth His head is two feet from Hector
and nobody knows it Least of all Hector

HECTOR (CONTD)
I cant see him but this is
definitely blood Maybe you got
him

And as he turns back he sees it The croc comes up as Hector
screams jumps off Screams Keough leaps off the truck and
charges into the shallow water with his gun looking to give
Hector some cover

Hector then resurfaces swimming to his bobbing chopper He
climbs in

KEOUGH
Where is he

HECTOR
I dont know

No sooner said than the croc comes launching up As he springs
toward the open chopper cabin Hector leaps out on the other
side The crocs head comes crashing clear through the cabin
and he becomes wedged The crocodile is stuck he protrudes
right through the chopper Hes not completely immobilized but
wherever he goes now the helicopter is going with him

KEOUGH
Hector

But now Jack has joined rifle in hand Hector surfaces again
swimming for shore Jack runs to help him onto land

KEOUGH (CONTD)
(taking aim)
Alright Game over

But the croc looks feeble now He lets out this MOAN of DEATH
And even Keough hesitates to pull the trigger

KEOUGH (CONTD)
(to Kelly)
Should I

KELLY
Wait

RESUME
The croc unable to dive is now thrashing toward the beach
But theres no rage in his behavior now He seems desperate
Hes taken some bullets hes tired hes wedged inside a two
ton piece of metal and hes exhausted

KELLY
I think the drugs are kicking in

Breathing heavily he lumbers into the shallow water unable to
free himself from the mangled wreckage As unbelievable as that
cow looked dangling from this very chopper the sight is even
more astonishing if not preposterous now A thirty foot
exhausted crocodile is wearing the broken helicopter And he
just cannot go on anymore

Kelly Hector Jack Keough stare back They approach with
caution They all stare at the tired crocodile

ANGLE THE CROC

Hes now looking back Bleeding gasping beaten In his
eyes we can see it The beast is beaten

ANGLE THE PRINCIPLES
Theres no triumph In their eyes sadness

I dont think we really want to

wait for him to catch his breath

It continues to breathe heavily

KELLY
Hes through fighting Look at
him

JACK

I dont care Hank End it
Keough raises his cannon

HECTOR
No Look Hes got nothing left

JACK
Yeah and every time we think
theres no more danger--

Upon which a twenty footer another croc thrusts up out of the
water seizing Hector Screams It death rolls Hector flings
him out of his mouth and in seconds hes coming up for more
Keough blasts his Avenger A direct hit

It takes the smaller crocs head right off sending it sailing
into the air It splashes down the first head not to hit
Kelly

They all then go for Hector pulling him to shore Hes
bleeding

HECTOR
Im okay

KELLY
Youre not okay your legs a mess

Keough quickly peels off his shirt Gives it to Kelly who goes
to work

KELLY

Yeah you got bit Im gonna fix

A sudden ROAR Kelly screams as Jack and Keough wheel to see
