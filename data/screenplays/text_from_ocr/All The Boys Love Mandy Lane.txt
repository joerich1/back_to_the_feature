EXT GRAVLIN RANCH —- DAY
A fence-line against the West Texas horizon

GARTH 33 clear-eyed and tan walks toward the corral He is
handsome in a hard unsmiling way Small scar above his eye

Behind him an aging ranch complex farmhouse cabins and
barn at the core of an 10000 acre spread

Garth carries an old bolt action Winchester pointed at the
ground He wears denim and leather No hat

Steers BELLOW in the corral Many are marked with circular
burns in their hide like a mange

Garth CLUCKS and several steers turn their heads

Garth exhales softly Stands back from the fence a bit Then
he brings the stock of the rifle up to his shoulder

A steer turns to face Garth a broad expanse between his
large eyes

Garth pulls the trigger

BANG

He pulls back the bolt to eject the spent cartridge chambers
another round The metalwork of the old gun resists him and
the steers BELLOW and shift in confusion

BANG

He exhales and methodically now repeats the labored action
BANG

Another steer drops to his knees

The cattle LOLL and MOAN There is pain in the cowboys face
He doesnt let up He ejects the cartridge and forces the
bolt forward to chamber another round Brings the gun to his
shoulder -- CLICK -- the gun doesnt fire

A fallen steer BELLOWS in pain blood seeping from its side

The unspent round jams The metalwork is hot hard to handle
Garth burns his finger as he tries to pry out the round
GARTH
God-damn it

He moves toward the door to the barn

INT BARN - CONTINUOUS

In a dark recess of the barn a work bench Mining and ranch
implements stand against the wall a TWO-HANDED MACHETE PICK-
AXE SCYTHE PITCHFORK and AXE

Garth grabs the MACHETE in both hands

EXT CORRAL -— CONTINUOUS

Garth ducks between the two rungs of the gate The beasts are
nervous On the verge of panic

Face stone-cold Garth moves toward the fallen steer grip
tightening on the machete

Garth raises the machete

The blade comes down fast a spray of blood comes up The
cattle BELLOW pathetically

Blood splatters Garths face

CUT TO

INT SCHOOL CORRIDOR AUSTIN TEXAS - LATE AFTERNOON

A SCHOOL BELL rings

High school STUDENTS pour into the corridor from classrooms
There is the CLAMOR of release after a long day of school as
the student move like cattle down the hall

EXT SCHOOL ENTRANCE - SAME

The students move en masse through the front doors of the
suburban school Down the steps to the circular drive

They form lines for carpools lines for buses

Parents wait in a line of family vehicles that extends as far
as the eye can see
Its rote students and parents moving without enthusiasm
through life until we find

MANDY LANE 16 auburn hair unadorned with make-up or
jewelry clear eyes scanning keen alert She seems to be
moving in a world of her own distinct from the mass

Mandy spots EMMET 16 the boy with spiked black hair and
wintery eyes and she moves to him Emmets totally out of
her league a friend from before Mandy became so lovely

EMMET
Good to go

Mandy nods They walk away from the lines navigating their
own path

EMMET
(faux chivalrous)
Take your bag

MANDY
Dont be stupid

They cut across a field toward the main road The grass is
tall dry After a minute

MANDY
Take your bag

Emmet foists his heavy backpack onto Mandys arm and walks
ahead of her

EMMET
Thanks

Mandy quietly lets Emmets pack slide to the ground Theyre
almost to the road before he notices

Rolling his eyes he jogs back to retrieve his pack

EXT SUBURBAN ROAD —- CONTINUOUS

Mandy walks along the road alone She hears the POUNDING BASS
of the stereo before she sees the JEEP monstrous tires
padded roll bars hunting lights - a vehicle as dangerous and
arrogant as its driver MIKE 18

Mike pulls the Jeep onto the gravel shoulder and rolls slowly
along with Mandy
MIKE
Hey baby Want a ride

Mandy stops Appraises her suitor

MANDY
Sure Thanks

Mandy grabs a hold of the roll bar and puts a foot up on the
running board but doesnt climb in She smiles at Mike

Mike smiles back cocky son-of-a-bitch Whats the hold up

MIKE
Alright Hop in

MANDY
Just a sec

And from nowhere Emmet swings his backpack into the backseat
and throws himself into the jeep

MIKE
The fuck

Mandy climbs into the passenger seat
MANDY
Thanks a lot Mike You know where
I live
EXT AUSTIN SPRAWL - EVENING

Mikes driving fast to impress Emmet and Mandy sit smug as
the wind tears through their hair Mike turns down the SOUND

MANDY
Im up another mile to the right

Mike nods Lifts his sunglasses to get a better look at her

MIKE
Here Have a sip

He hands her a paper cup Mandy smells it potent hands it
back to Mike

MANDY
No thanks

EMMET
Smells like Southern Comfort
Emmet laughs Mike doesnt offer him any

EMMET
No thanks

Mike scowls at Emmet in the rear view mirror Mike downs the
contents of the cup

They get to Mandys intersection and Mike slows down but he
turns left

MANDY
No Im to the right

EXT GRAVEL ROAD -— CONTINUOUS

The road cuts across a meadow toward an enormous construction
site a sprawling housing development only half completed A
sign RANDALL LUXURY HOMES

MIKE
Up for a little party

EMMET
Where are you taking us asshole

Mike shoots a look back at Emmet The Jeep swerves a bit on
the gravel Mike corrects tries his game again with Mandy

MIKE
You never been to the Randall site
Theyre putting up some nice
places Ill show you one

MANDY
I dont want to see one

EMMET
Well walk from here Stop

Mike accelerates pulling off-road and racing to climb a
small mound of landfill

MANDY

Mike puts a hand on Mandys leg Emmet leans forward

EMMET
Stop you fucking idiot

Mike turns to strike Emmet
MANDY
No

AND MIKE LOSES CONTROL OF THE JEEP

EXT CRASH SITE - EVENING
The Jeep is upside-down in the shrubs and grass

Mandy and Emmet have been thrown clear of the vehicle
Emmets face is cut hes bleeding above one eye

Mike WHEEZES with raspy breath His back is on the ground
his legs are mangled inside the overturned vehicle His blood
is all over the jeep

Mandy fights to keep her eyes open but succumbs

DISSOLVE TO

EXT CRASH SITE - LATER
The gravel road appears to go on forever nothing in sight

It takes all of Mandys strength to lift her head Her eyes
flutter and close

DISSOLVE TO

EXT CRASH SITE - LATER

Shattered glass in the dirt Mandy can HEAR her own heart
She tries to move but cant

Mandy watches as Emmet pulls himself through broken glass
oil and coolant to the Jeep He pulls Mike from the wreck

A CELL PHONE lies several feet away

MIKE
Call for help

Emmet places a hand on Mikes neck feeling the thin pulse
Mike bleeds badly Coughs blood onto Emmets hand

Emmet remains eerily calm

MIKE
I cant breathe
And Emmet just holds him

Mike struggles against Emmets grasp He looks wildly at
Mandy at the cell phone at Emmet

MIKE
Call

EMMET
Shh

Emmet places a hand over Mikes mouth suffocating him

When Mandy meets Emmets gaze there is a terrifying calm in
his eyes a brutal coldness Mandy watches unblinking as

EMMET KILLS MIKE SLOWLY

On the dark horizon now the blue and red ROLLERS of
emergency vehicles

Mandy watches the lights approach and then makes eye contact
with Emmet one last time before she passes out

FADE TO BLACK

looking up at her JERRY JEFF WALKER drones eerily

She lingers by the window and removes her bra

Seeing Garth walk away Chloe pulls on a dry shirt

INT BARN - NIGHT

Something moves silently through the barn watching Marlin go
down on Jake

Jake is deeply absorbed in the moment He closes his eyes
He climaxes loudly

JAKE
Yarrr

Jake zips up and pulls Marlin to her feet Runs his hands
through his hair

JAKE
Dang
MARLIN

Jake nods
JAKE

Guess Id better check on Chloe

Jake winks at the astonished Marlin and walks away leaving
her in the barn

Marlin watches him leave her lower lip beginning to tremble
Then she hears a TAPPING from the dark end of the barn

She gets up slowly and moves deeper into the barn In the
dark recess the MACHETE is no longer where it stood

MARLIN
Whos there

Marlin passes under a rafter and

A GLOVED HAND

reaches down and grabs the back of her shirt--

MARLIN

Something shining on a beam catches Jakes attention He
moves toward it carefully

Jake steps into a dark PUDDLE at the base of the beam He
reaches for the shiny object which rests on a rusty nail

MARLINS diamond-crusted BELLY-BUTTON RING covered with
blood

Sensing something behind him Jake turns
A looming FIGURE rises backlit in the doorway

Jake starts backing away The FIGURE lurches toward him the
glint of the MACHETE held high

What the--

Jake sprints through the darkness to the opposite door
EXT

JEEP ROAD —- SAME

ducks beneath the wire leaving the road for the dark

Jake looks about in the darkness SILENCE
He moves toward the bank gropes for the wall

The moon waits behind the windmill

Mandy and Chloe sit on the couch Tyrone sits in the rocking
chair by the window holding the rifle

Mandy looks at the portrait of William Tuck still staring at
them still mad Red enters with a bottle of Jack and beers

CHLOE

Red tosses Chloe a beer which she snags out of the air

TYRONE
Nice catch

The house emits a long terrible GROAN like the hull of a
ship The kids cluster together scared

RED
Its just the house settling The
mine shaft runs beneath us Just
settling

CHLOE
Oh thats cool Just a mine shaft
full of trapped dead miners Cute

MANDY
(off painting)
Was he trapped there with them

Red looks up at old man Tuck

RED
Nah He never sent for help The
miners relatives hanged him from
the rafters in the barn after they
killed his wife and son They say
he wont rest till his kin owns the
land again

TYRONE
Is your father kin

RED
Old Tuck has no kin

Tyrone and Chloe look up at the portrait with dread

INT LIVINGROOM - LATER

Chloe grinds up a Ritalin tablet on the coffee table Red
rolls a joint Tyrone sets down four fresh beers A new peace
appears to have settled over the kids A calm

RED
A lot of guys were traumatized by
the first Gulf War I know Garth
saw a lot of people die

TYRONE
Bet that fucked him up

RED
Seems okay Same thing when his
wife died He just got real quiet
and then said Sometimes its just
better this way

CHLOE
Thats so sad

RED
She was real sick I guess he was
happy she didnt suffer much

MANDY
What happens when your parents sell
the ranch

RED
The corporations that buy up these
family ranches usually bring in
their own crew I think Garthll
just have to move on

A SILENCE begins to creep over the room
CHLOE
Hey lets change the subject
right I mean we just finished
junior year We should be
celebrating

RED
Bottoms up

Red takes a long pull from the bottle He sits on the couch
with Mandy and Chloe Chloe considers the bottle and drinks

While Tyrone drinks Mandy sees movement outside the window

MANDY

Tyrone spins outside the window theres only darkness

TYRONE
Nothing there

Chloe and Mandy stand behind him

Tyrone nods ready

RED

gun

RED

GARTH (0S)
I want my gun back now And whoever
fucked up my jeep better have an
explanation

RED
What are you talking about

GARTH (0S)
Someone ripped out the starter

work vehicle not a toy your

Red opens the door
GARTH

Landor appears behind Garth stares at Tyrone

TYRONE

Garth holds onto Landors collar

GARTH

(to Tyrone)
Youre going to point that thing at
the floor nice and slow and then
youre going to engage the safety
and then youre going to hand it
over to me Any of you gets hurt
Mr Gravlinll kill me

Tyrone breaks his fierce manly gaze and shoots an
inquisitive look at Red

RED
Its okay Come in
INT DININGROOM - LATER

Theyre all at the table Landor lies by the door Red
Mandy and Chloe appear to feel safer with Garth in here

Tyrone eyes him suspiciously

TYRONE
Well where were you

Red shoots Tyrone a look

GARTH
Theres a place I go sometimes
thats all
Beat
CHLOE

The phone line is dead

GARTH
I told your father we need a radio

Red hands the bottle of whiskey to Garth almost an apology
Garth takes a slug from the bottle Chloe reaches for it
brings it slowly to her lips A bit too slowly Whiskey
dribbles down her chin

Mandy goes into the kitchen Garth watches as she passes by

Chloe bats her eyes at the cowboy

CHLOE
I feel a lot better with you here

INT KITCHEN —- SAME

Mandy splashes water on her face She notices a drop of blood
on her arm just under her sleeve Confused she washes her
arm off checks for any sort of injury Finds none

Mandy studies her reflection in the window Red and Garth
BANTER in the livingroom

Mandy shuts the kitchen light so that she can see outside
Out there in the darkness she sees only shadows

INT LIVINGROOM - LATER

Mandy comes back in and sits on the floor beside Landor
Garth cleans the old rifle while he talks

GARTH
This ranch has had a lot of bad
luck Gorgeous property but its
cursed to hell

Garth looks up at William Tucks portrait

RED
Tell them about the mine

GARTH
Used to be an old mining outfit
Thirty-five miners disappeared here
about eighty years ago

Chloe WHISTLES

GARTH
Mine flooded Some were drowned
Some were trapped in air pockets
deep beneath the ground Times at
night I could swear I hear them
tapping waiting for their rescue
(beat)
Old Tuck never sent a rescue party

The kids look scared Garth chambers a round checks the
safety

GARTH
They say thats why there are no
songbirds on this ranch Too many
canaries died in these mines

CHLOE
(she lies)
I noticed that

GARTH
Helps to understand the will of the
land And let me tell you the will
of this place aint nothing pretty

RED
All that stuff might have been true
fifty years ago But things are
different now

GARTH
Nowadays you get illegal immigrants
moving across the land at night
desperate afraid Sometimes they
set foot on the wrong property

The kids watch Garth transfixed Mandy runs her hand through
Landors thick coat

GARTH
There are no laws against shooting
a trespasser in the late hours of
the night Not if that mans got a
Christian family to protect

RED
Thats politics not the land

GARTH
Seen what the land did to your
dads herd Lesions dropping
calves

RED
My dad sold the herd He told me

GARTH
(soft)
He didnt sell the herd Red Cant
sell them sick like that

Red struggles to absorb this new information Mandy watches
Garth with some quiet form of admiration

TYRONE
What did you do to them

GARTH
Cant cure cattle like that All
you can do is put them down And
try to be merciful

RED

Im glad well be done with this
place soon then

GARTH
Another family ranch swallowed up
by the corporation ranch

RED
Not the wild west anymore

Mandy returns to the couch Chloe stretches makes sure Garth
can see the top of her panties

from the ceiling

He hears the CANARY SONG coming from the next cabin over
Tyrone turns to leave and hears the CANARY SONG behind him

He spins

TYRONE

Tyrone reaches down and flips over the cot nothing there

Moonlight cuts through cracks in the old wall boards Tyrone
puts his face to the wall and peers out through a crack

His eyes widen
JAKES HUNTING KNIFE SLICES THROUGH THE WALL

Tyrone clutches his abdomen When he holds his hands in the
light he sees they are covered with BLOOD

Tyrone looks down to see the handle of the knife protruding
from his gut

He sinks to his knees Falls to the floor Hearing FOOTSTEPS

Landor lifts his head
Landor emits a WHINE that turns into a GROWL

Mandy gets up silent She sees the gun resting across the
arms of the rocking chair where Garth sleeps

Landor GROWLS low there is something beyond the wall

Mandy reaches for the gun and Garth wakes with a start He
grabs the rifle

MANDY
(whisper )
Someones there
Garths eyes glow like embers Mandy can feel them

Garth checks the window then moves over to his dog

GARTH

conceal this from Mandy

He opens the door

EXT FARMHOUSE —- SAME

Garth and Landor step out into the night Garth looks around

laugh over all this You hungry

MANDY
No God my head hurts real bad

Garth raises his cup

GARTH
This1l help

And then quiet

GARTH
Nietzsche

Mandy pushes the book towards him

MANDY
I read this in school Its meant a
lot to me After my parents died
it helped me see that guilt and
grief can make a person weak

GARTH
First time I read this I thought
the book might burst into flames
right in my hands

Mandys eyes sparkle at the suggestion

GARTH
Equally hateful is your grinning
death which creeps up like a thief
-- and yet comes as the master

Shes impressed

MANDY
I was just reading about the storm

GARTH
Come shake the rotten fruit from
the tree

MANDY
Didnt know ranch hands liked

exposed beams and the open half of the roof

He moves forward checking each stall and scanning the
rafters as he advances

Halfway through the barn something moves behind him

EXT GARTHS CABIN - SAME

Landor stares at the barn His WHINE deepens to a LOW GROWL

INT BARN —- SAME

Garths attention is seized by a small feathery object
beside a bale of hay on the floor He moves in closer

The BARN OWL that spooked Marlin is dead Garth bends to
study the dead animal

The owl is teeming with maggots

A FOOTFALL behind Garth but he turns too late
BANG

GARTH IS BLIND-SIDED BY A SHOVEL He drops to his knees

BANG

Garth is leveled by another blow to his back

EXT GARTHS CABIN - DAY

Mandy comes around the side of the cabin with a bottle
water in her hand

Landor GROWLS and pulls against his rope The rope is
starting to fray at one end

Tyrone opens his eyes He looks at Mandy The dog GROWLING

TYRONE

Mandy nods

MANDY
Youre alright too

Above her a vulture circles slowly waiting it would seem
for Tyrone to die

Just then Landors rope snaps

MANDY
Landor no

But the dog is gone running full speed toward the house

Mandy stands Watches Landor disappear behind the house
SILENCE

and then the frightening noise of a DOGS LAST CRY

Mandy looks at the house shocked scared full of dread

MANDY
No Oh no

And everywhere a horrible dead stillness

Tyrone winces

TYRONE
You Need A weapon

Mandy pulls back the bloody compress
SLOWLY MANDY PULLS THE KNIFE OUT OF TYRONES ABDOMEN

INT GARTHS CABIN - SAME
Mandy scans the small dark room The taxidermy
A bookshelf bearing Nietzsche Sartre Dostoyevsky

Mandy tucks Jakes bloody hunting knife into her belt

Her eyes come to rest on a small framed photograph of Garth
leading a young woman on horseback Another photograph shows
Garth in his Desert Storm uniform

Above the frame through the window an endless sea of grass

EXT DIRT ROAD - DAY

Holding hands Chloe and Red come to a wide open plain
They walk quickly almost a jog

FLIT FLIT FLIT

CROWS stream off from a small hedge Red and Chloe freeze
Red scans the horizon in all directions

Just quiet the WIND in the dry grass

Red squeezes Chloes hand They turn to proceed

EXT DIRT ROAD - SECONDS LATER

Chloe runs as fast as she can

She cuts off the road running through scattered sage brush
and knee-high grass

EXT OPEN RANGE - SAME

Chloe runs in no particular direction just away from the
road and fast

She looks back panicked but cannot see what follows her

The wide open range Fear drives her on heaving stumbling
running for all shes got until

Chloe twists her ankle and falls

Frantically on her belly still she looks around nothing
but the dry buffalo grass the spinning sky the clouds
EXT DIRT ROAD - DAY

Red struggles trying to crawl barely able to move

A SHADOW crosses over him

Reds blood seeps into the dirt The SHADOW stands still
watching waiting Red stops

Red turns over

EMMET towers above him eyes silver and cold

EMMET BRINGS THE MACHETE DOWN ON RED

When Reds body stops twitching Emmet takes Chloes car keys
from Reds pocket

EXT OPEN RANGE - SAME

Chloe runs to the road as best she can on her injured ankle

She turns and looks back when she hears the distant ROAR of
her LEXUS

CHLOE
No

Chloe struggles to run faster along the edge of the road

EXT GARTHS CABIN - DAY
Mandy looks down the road A distant DUST TRAIL appears
Tyrone gasps

MANDY
Here they come

The DUST TRAIL grows closer a rooster tail She cant see
the road but knows the car is drawing towards them fast
EXT DIRT ROAD - CONTINUOUS

THE CAR BEARS DOWN ON CHLOE LIKE A SHARK chewing up dust and
gravel as it guns for her legs

In the nick of time Chloe cuts off the road onto the narrow
shortcut that leads toward Garths cabin

EXT GARTHS CABIN - CONTINUOUS

CHLOE (0S)
Man-dy

Limping exhausted and panicked Chloe stumbles along the
shortcut from the road The FEAR in her eyes is extreme

CHLOE
Mandy

A RUMBLE of tires on the dirt road Mandy watches the DUST
TRAIL of the vehicle as it passes by on its way around the
cul-de-sac loop She moves toward Chloe

MANDY
Im here Chloe Im here

Crying Chloe throws herself into Mandys arms Mandy holds
her tight The SHOCK is overwhelming for Chloe

As Chloe and Mandy embrace the world seems to spin around
them Chloes eyes widen with fear

MANDY
Its okay

The Lexus turns past the barn Chloe watches over Mandys
shoulder as the Lexus pulls up to Garths cabin

Chloes voice is gone She tries to speak but a small line
of blood comes out of her mouth as she watches in horror

CHLOE
Nnnhh-

Behind Mandy the ENGINE turns off
MANDY
(to Chloe)
Its over now Its almost over
The car door SLAMS
MANDY
(whisper )

Reds here

Chloe tries to focus through the haze of pain as Emmet
approaches behind Mandy

Behind Mandy Emmet walks toward them covered in blood the
MACHETE loose in one hand lips tight eyes cold and hard

Chloes body shakes with violent sobs
CHLOE
(whisper )

Run Run

Mandy steps away from Chloe seeing for the first time the
blood-drenched Emmet

Then Chloe looks down at her abdomen Jakes HUNTING KNIFE
PROTRUDES FROM HER STOMACH

She looks at MANDYS HAND covered in fresh blood still
holding the knifes handle

STEM-TO-STERNUM MANDY RIPS THE KNIFE THROUGH CHLOE
Chloe falls to her knees
Mandy stares at her with cold pity

And then Mandy swings her gaze over to Emmet

MANDY
What took you so long

Chloe collapses in the dust Mandy reaches down and rips the
knife from Chloes gut

EMMET
Had to borrow the keys from Red

MANDY
She gave him the keys Thats
almost sweet

Emmet steps closer
EMMET

Look how bloody you are Youre a
god-damned one man slaughterhouse

MANDY
Tyrones a real gusher

EMMET
That the knife you killed him with

MANDY
Im not sure hes dead

EMMET
The idea was to kill them not

Mandy squints at Emmet

MANDY
Like you killed Chloe

EMMET
Thought Id share

MANDY
Very sweet

Emmet walks over to Tyrone He squats beside him
EMMET
Hes breathing You shouldnt have
let him suffer so long

MANDY
He shouldnt have kissed me

SCHWING
MANDY BRINGS THE KNIFE DOWN ON TYRONE FAST

EMMET
So long tiger

Tyrone lies still dead in the dust

Emmet grins His teeth white behind the blood on his face

EMMET

Mandy looks Emmet in the eye A cold look Hard to read

EMMET
Thats everyone right

MANDY
Dont know Sure you got Red

Emmet laughs nervously

EMMET
Reds dead

MANDY
And this

Mandy reaches into her pocket and extracts Marlins bloody

diamond-crusted BELLY-BUTTON RING

EMMET
Thought youd want a souvenir

Mandy hands the ring to Emmet

MANDY

Emmet rips the knife out of Tyrone Admires the

Emmets stung taken aback that Mandy would insult him now

EMMET
Come on Lets get out of here

Emmet tucks the hunting knife in his belt and holds out a
bloody hand to Mandy

Mandy looks past Emmet Her gaze hardens

MANDY
Oops Maybe I did leave one

Emmet looks confused

GARTH (0S)
Mandy run

Garth stands by the Lexus makeshift bandage around his head
the old rifle aimed at Emmet From Garths point of view
Emmet towers over Mandy with a machete in his hand
Mandy starts to back away from Emmet
MANDY
(soft)
I left him alive for a reason

Emmet looks at Mandy utterly bewildered

EMMET
What

MANDY
Garth help

Emmet steps toward Mandy
Garth FIRES the rifle A bullet tears flesh off Emmets

shoulder but does little more than surprise him Emmet spins
on Garth

In full rage Garth lumbers toward Emmet chambering a new
round Emmet grins and charges with the machete

GARTH
Kill my dog you sick fuck

Garth raises the gun to his shoulder and

CLICK The gun doesnt fire

Emmet moves toward Garth relentless MACHETE raised
Garth deflects the blow of the machete with the barrel

Emmet swings and Garth hits Emmet on the back with the stock
of the gun Emmet sprawls forward in the dust

EMMET
Aargh

Garth clears the chamber and starts to reload the rifle
EMMET
(quietly)
Youre going to have to work faster
than that

MANDY (0S)
NO

Emmet and Garth both look up
Mandy is still there watching

GARTH
Mandy run

Mandy takes off

Emmet is back on his feet and the MACHETE flashes
HE CUTS INTO GARTHS SIDE

Slowly Emmet pulls the MACHETE out

Garth falls to his knees

Emmet turns and runs after Mandy

EXT SWIMMING HOLE —- SAME

Mandy sprints past the gallows-like structure

EXT GARTHS CABIN - SAME
Emmet holds his shoulder then looks at his bloodied hand

EMMET
Argh

He sets off in pursuit

EXT WINDMILL - SAME

Daylight weighs down hard upon her A narrow path extends
away from the windmill

Mandy scans the site for a weapon Seeing none she races for
the path

Theres a stillness out here as if the landscape were
already dead and Mandy the only living creature for miles

The windmill GROANS miserably

EXT SWIMMING HOLE - SAME
Emmet races past the swimming hole
EMMET
Mandy What the fuck
EXT SMALL PATH - SAME
Mandy flies through tall grass and sage brush

The small path leads south away from the house which looms
on the rise in the distance

Mandy reaches a rutted two-track road and follows its
gentle downward grade

EXT THE PIT - SAME

Mandy is running at top speed

Several large brown mounds offer shelter and Mandy dives
between two gulping hard for oxygen

But its not just the run - theres a smell that steals her
breath too Mandys face twists with disgust

Shes lying in a sludge wretched and caked almost mud but
far more hideous

Mandy focuses on the large brown mounds and sees that they
are flesh and hide bloated rotting and decomposing in the
fierce sun

DEAD CATTLE

Slowly Mandy lifts her head above the cows

Vultures lift their beaks from their gory labor in unison
Some dry their wings in the sun unmoving

Mandys hand lands on something hard
The horn of a cow SKULL
Mandy SCREAMS scrambles to her feet when

Emmet tackles her with a dive They land hard in the dust at
the edge of the cattle pit

Emmet pins Mandy to the ground His machete is beside them
but Emmet grabs her hands before she can reach it

EMMET
Stop Stop

He chips her across the chin with his elbow knocking her
head back in the dust

EMMET
Stop

Mandy struggles for breath Spits a spray of blood

EMMET
Why are you doing this to us

Her eyes are pure fury

MANDY
What Emmet What am I doing to us

EMMET
You set me up Youll never get
away with it

MANDY
‘Local track star Never touched
alcohol Never experimented with
drugs Never touched a boy

EMMET
Bullshit

MANDY
They always believe the virgin
Everyones going to feel so bad
that I had to live through this

EMMET
You cant do this without me

MANDY
Ive got my alibi

EMMET
I just killed your cowboy alibi

MANDY
Hope you killed him better than you
killed Chloe

Mandy tries to grab the hunting knife from Emmets belt and
the tip of the knife digs into Emmets thigh He quickly
regains control of Mandys hand

EMMET
I did it for you When Mike flipped
the jeep and I killed him that was
for you Our whole plan I did that
for you

Mandy breaks a small grin Her perfect teeth are bloody

MANDY
You didnt do it for me You killed
them because they were weak To
rid our generation of the weak

EMMET
That was just talk Fuck Nietzsche
I did it for you Mandy I1l do
anything for you I love you

Mandys demeanor softens There are tears in Emmets eyes

MANDY
Emmet

EMMET
(guard down)
You knew that

MANDY
Youre the same as all the rest
Pathetic Vulnerable And weak

Mandy knees Emmet hard in the groin Shes out from under him
and on her feet in a flash

She reaches for the machete but Emmets already grabbed it

So Mandy runs

EXT FENCE LINE - SAME
Mandy runs along the fence line that leads to the barn
Emmet moves quickly in pursuit despite his wounds

Theyre racing in the same direction bound to intersect
before Mandy can reach the farmhouse

EMMET
Hey

Mandy runs past a fallen FENCE POST and picks it up without
slowing down It fits nicely in her hand like a staff She
turns to face her adversary

EMMET
Mandy

Hes yards away now holding the machete with both hands
swinging it slightly as if to propel himself along

MANDY
You want more

EMMET
Leave with me or die here

Mandy raises the FENCE POST like a baseball bat

MANDY
Thats more like it

EMMET
Whats it going to be

She raises the fence post higher ready to strike

MANDY
Ive already destroyed you

CRACK
Mandy swings the fence post hard against Emmets shoulder

MANDY
Now Im going to kill you

Emmet stares at her dazed unable to comprehend that she
would hurt him The anger surfaces quickly

EMMET
Have to hit harder than that

Lightning fast he swings the MACHETE
Mandy blocks the blow with the fence post
She stumbles backward but does not lose her balance

EMMET
Fast But not strong

SCHWING Emmet swings again

Mandy deflects the blow but the blade slides along the fence
post and cuts her left hand badly

MANDY
Argh

EMMET
I was going to show you Paradise

Emmet stands upright gaining strength from a place of
absolute hatred He raises his gaze to meet hers

EMMET
But now Im going to show you Hell

He raises the machete above his head hands slick with blood
Mandy swings the fence post hard against the machete

The machete digs deep into the wood and slips out of Emmets
hands MANDYS FENCE POST IS NOW A LETHAL WEAPON WITH A
HIDEOUS BLADE PROTRUDING FROM ONE END

BAM

EMMET
Argh

BAM She swings the weapon again and again cutting Emmets
shoulder with his own blade

MANDY
I may see you down there yet

Emmet drops to his knees no longer resisting a broken boy
