EXT SMALL LOCAL COLLEGE - MAGIC HOUR 1

We see the entrance to a small college campus leafless trees
lining the road

The wind is blowing

The sun is setting and the sky has a hazy red tint

EXT—COLLEGE—PARKING-LOT- — MAGIG—-HOUR 4
We see a parking lot with only a few cars

A couple of students walk past in the distance

EXT CAMPUS GROUNDS - MAGIC HOUR 3
A few students are on their way back to class

Some trash and beer cans dot the campus grounds

The faint sound of crappy music is playing somewhere off in
the distance

EXT COLLEGE CAMPUS - MAGIC HOUR 4

A small fountain - flowing weakly - sits in the middle of a
pond with a few ducks

A couple of students walk by

We dont see any faces

reading

We see four young girls - all in their early twenties -
sitting around a table

All four girls are very cute
They are sitting quietly next to one another

BRIT has blonde hair and sharp eyes

Spring Breakers pg 2

She is listening to head phones and we can hear that it is
rap music

She bobs her head ever so slightly

She is wearing a white baseball cap with a curved brim that
is pulled down almost to her eyes

Her stare is hard

CANDY is sitting next to her

Her hair is darker

She has thick ved lips and her nails are bright red

Shes wearing a T-shirt with Snoopy on it Snoopy is holding
a gun in the picture

FAITH is sitting next to her

She has a stunning face

She is wearing no make up and a crucifix necklace

She looks extremely innocent and doe-eyed

Her breasts are large and she is wearing a pink sweater
She takes a sip from a box of chocolate milk

Sitting next to her is COTTY

CoTTy has a very cute baby face

Her hair is in a short bob and her eyes are crystal blue

All the girls speak sound alike with a bit of a southern
accent

They are from the same town

They sit quietly for a bit looking around at the other
students in the cafeteria

COTTY

We gotta get the fuck out of here
FAITH

I know
BRIT

How much money do we have

CANDY
About halfway there
(under her breath)
Halfway to paradise

Long pause

BRIT
I’m so ready to get my party on

COTTY grabs three french fries and sticks them in her mouth

BRIT yawns

INT HISTORY CLASS - DAY 6

A HISTORY PROFESSOR stands in front of a nearly full
classroom giving a talk on civil rights

Almost all the students are taking notes

BRIT is sitting next to CANDY

She is writing something into her note pad

BRIT looks around to make sure no one else is looking at her

She holds wp her note pad and laughs she tries to muffle it
with her shoulder

She has written the words “I WANT PENIS” on the note pad

There is a bright pink heart drawn very neatly around the
sentence

CANDY nods in agreement and flips open her notebook

She grabs a big black magic marker and pops the cap off with
her mouth

She darts her eyes quickly around the room
She writes onto a piece of paper

She holds it up to CANDY’S face

It says “SPRING BREAK BITCH”
She has drawn a large penis around the words
They both start laughing

A CHUBBY REDHEADED GIRL STUDENT with thick glasses and a nose
ring makes a loud shhhhh noise

CANDY flicks her off

BRIT kicks the side of CANDYS leg

They—both—try—and-stifle—their—Laughs—but—te—no—avaids
Some of the students sitting around them seem annoyed

The PROFESSOR pays no attention to them continuing his
speech on civil rights

We see a bed with the top completely covered in neat stacks
of hundred dollar bills

On top of the bed of money are many guns

The guns all have silencers

There is also a sawed off shotgun and a couple of mini uzi’s
It’s a small arsenal on a bed full of money

CANDY and BRIT are staring down at it

The room is lit with one red light bulb on his dresser

It casts a hazy red glow throughout the room

ALIEN has his shirt off

He is smoking a blunt

He takes a deep pull and then lets out a steady stream of
smoke

He is holding a gun in each hand

With his gun he motions to the bed full of money

She points to two tiny palm sized pistols with solid ivory
grips

neck

There’s an open bottle of champagne sitting on the piano He
starts hitting a few random keys on the piano

There are trees all around his backyard that form a natural
fence

The sound of dogs barking in the distance
BRIT opens the screen door of the house and walks out

She’s wearing her same full faced pink ski mask with the
unicorn patch that she wore in the first robbery

He plays the simple pop piano intro and then begins to sing
the words

He sings this in a serious non-ironic manner as if he were
on stage in front of huge audience

and with emotion)
Notice me take my hand why are we
strangers when our love is strong

We begin to see close ups of their masked faces

ALIEN starts singing the chorus all the while staring at the
three girls holding shotguns

without my wings I feel so small
I guess I need you baby and

They run up the sand

They run up the deck and jump a fence

The sound of big dogs barking

The girls dont pause or hesitate for a second

They keep running full steam and we are running with them

As they get close to the house they begin screaming like wild
animals

They run past a swimming pool and up some stairs

There are four THUGS smoking weed in the back of the house
Two of them are wearing bullet proof vests

They all have on gold chains and gold teeth

The girls screams become louder and more sustained very
high pitched

The noise is so strange and off putting that the THUGS seem
confused by it

We are still running with the girls

They are running towards the thugs

A few of the THUGS start to stand up

They are all strapped with guns

The girls run up to the THUGS and start firing

CANDY shoots the UGLY FEMALE THUG(the same one that shot
COTTY)

She shoots her directly in the forehead

Her body drops like a wet rag and blood goes everywhere

from either girl

They do this while running forward the entire time
They do it like it’s video game

The THUGS drop to the floor

Blood goes all over the walls and floor

The girls keep running

We follow them through various rooms

They kick open ARCHIE’S bedroom door

They flick the lights on

He is not there

There is a noise machine in his room that has drowned out all
the sound

The noise machine is playing an ocean sound

They walk through his bedroom and into his massive marble
bathroom

There are two naked girls taking a shower together

ARCHIE is in the huge bathtub watching he’s submerged in
bubbles

He goes to grab his gun next to the bathtub
The girls run towards him

The FERRARI is parked off to the side
CANDY is holding a cell phone up to her ear

BRIT looks over at CANDY and smiles

Theres a shopping cart turned over on its side with a red
balloon tied to it

‘The balloon is flapping in the wind

There is sand and garbage everywhere
There are palm trees in the background
CANDY rolls here eyes and bats her lashes

She looks like she is about to laugh at something
