MINIS FIRST TIME

Written by

Nick Guthe

CLOSE ON

The face of MINERVA MINI DROGUES 18 watching something

She looks extremely bored by the television images
flickering

across her eyes She has a pretty face Large eyes and
pouty

mouth Her knowing look is incongruous with a face clearly

still that of a girl

- MINI (V0O)
I know what youre thinking Dont
bullshit me because I do Youre

- thinking oh dear lord in heaven
please Im begging you Ill gouge

- out my eyes with the straw in my
drink right now Ill jam every
last kernel of popcorn into my

- mouth until I suffocate just not
another fucking teenage coming-of-
age story

We pull back to reveal her body which is moving out of that
awkward stage between adolescence and womanhood Though tall
and thin her hips havent quite rounded Shes wearing a
FUCT T-shirt and jean shorts

MINI (VO) (CONTD)
Well relaxno prom night
highjinks no nerds becoming
popular and no Shakespeare set in
high schoolI promise

CLOSE ON THE TV SCREEN When Animals Attack is on In a
series of quick cuts

A zoo keeper is mauled by an elephant

A sport fisherman is attacked on the deck of a boat by a
shark he and his buddies thought was dead

A pit bull clamps down on his owners arm
An alligator hunter stupidly puts his head in the mouth of

a
just-captured alligator only to have it chomp down on his
skull
MINI (VO)
Since it happened everyones
asked me how it all started

Minis face registers no reaction to the gruesome images We

now see she is sitting in the living room of a well-
appointed

Studio City hillside home

INT THE LIVING ROOM- EVENING- A PARTY

TEENAGERS OF PRIVILEGE and their UPTIGHT PARENTS are milling
around dancing and chatting as A DEEJAY spins tunes

MINI (VO)
I suppose the obvious answer is my
eighteenth birthday

Mini dances with a few friends in a very short mini-skirt

and
halter top She clearly understands how to the drive the
boys
crazy and this is not lost on her mother DIANE 42 who
stands off to the side nursing a drink with some other
HYPER-
AEROBICIZED MOTHERS
MINI (VO)
See I was blessed with a terrific
mom Not only is she a lush but
she also hates me
Diane is beautiful but there is an essential hardness to
her
that comes from a life spent trading on her looks The
blouse and mini-skirt she wears are inappropriately
revealing

for the occasion of her daughters birthday

MINI (VO)
A few days before the party I
overhear her on the phone ordering
me a male stripper Nothing says I
love you like ten inches of man
meat in your face

Diane and the other mothers are talking about Minis
dancing

MINI (VO)
And knowing dear old ma shell try
and nail him after the partyin
my bed

Minis friend KAYLA a little rounder but also brash comes
dancing over Shes swaying her hips provocatively at Mini
almost challenging her

MIKE RUDELL a tanned and trim man of 55 watches their
display clearly enjoying the way its jump-starting his
imagination

MINI (VO)
That guy Our neighbor Mike Rudell
big shot TV producer and the guy my
mom screws whenever the batteries
run out

Kayla and Mini begin dancing together in a very explicit
way
clearly trying to make the adults uncomfortable

MINI
Yo bee-ach

KAYLA
Yo birthday bee-ach

MINI
Is it on

KAYLA
Oh its on
MINI
Thats my girl

Mini grabs Kayla and dips her low

INT THE KITCHEN - LATER

Kayla instructs some CATERERS to start wheeling a giant
birthday cake into the living room The caterers look
confused but Kayla is insistent and the young men obey

starting to wheel the cake down the long hall

INT THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The cake emerges from the hallway The caterers begin

singing
Happy Birthday as Diane turns to see it and her eyes
flash
rage As Diane comes storming over we switch to SLOW
MOTION
MINI (VO)
See to understand me you need to
understand that life in my
opinion is all about new
experiences Firsts is what I
call them
As she strides across the room the look of vitriolic rage
on
Dianes face grows stronger with every step

MINI (VO) (CONTD)
Somewhere around fourteen when I
had my firstrhymes with duck I
realized that the goal of life any
life should be to cram as many
firsts into it as possible

We switch back to real time

DIANE
What the hell are you doing I said
wait until-
(looking around)
Shes not even here you morons

A YOUNG CATERERS face turns white

CATERER
But but her friend said--

POP Suddenly the lid to the cake flies off and from behind
we see A NUDE MINI rises out of it like Venus on the half
shell

MINI
SURPRISE

MINIS POV

A collection of reactions from the party goers The mothers
are numb the fathers pretend to be disturbed while copping
looks and her friends are in stitches Some are even waving
dollar bills M
MINI (V0) (CONTD)

That was definitely a first but

more importantly it was the first

time I really understood my

potentialAnd thats when it all

started

Mini leans over and gives her STUNNED mom a big hug

MINI (CONTD)
(doing her best Donna
Reed)
Oh Mom this is the best birthday

INT MINIS BATHROOM - NIGHT

MINI (VO) (CONTD)
Theyre basically saying Im not
worthy of a unique experience on
this earthWell sorry but I

The law of firsts has served me
well because its liberated me
from the usual pathetic repetitive
concerns of high school

ROY a cocky chiseled all-around nightmare sticks his
tongue in his cheek simulating a blow job

TROY
Yo Kayla I got some more of what
you were looking for Saturday
night

MINI (VO)
AhhThe joys of the American
educational system

Kayla puts her head down her face turning red as Mini
stops
to address Troy and his posse

MINI (CONTD)
(suddenly brightening)
Actually Troy I think you
confused her with that senile
toothless grandmother of yours

Ooohs and Aaahs erupt from the onlookers as Troy looks
concerned his ambush has backfired

TROY
Yo Mini why dont you use that
mouth for something useful and suck
my dick

More students start to gather overhearing them

MINI
Actually now that you mention it
I cant think of anything Id
rather do than suck your dick

Troy looks around surprised and emboldened by her
declaration

TROY
Well its all for you babe

Mini moves closer looking him right in the eye

MINI
Really

TROY
(daring her)
If you can fit it all in

The crowd has now swelled to a few dozen as everyone is
riveted by the exchange Suddenly Mini starts unzipping his
fly

TROY (CONTD)
Hey what the

MINI
(grabbing his belt buckle)
Im going to suck your dick Troy

Troy tries to push her away but shes got a grip on his
belt Everyone watching is almost speechless at first but
then giggles start to erupt

TROY
Yo this aint funny

MINI
No Troy I want to suck your dick
right now

TROY
Jesus Mini come on get off

MINI
(screaming)
No Troy You said I could now

She gets down on her knees struggling to get a hand in his
pants The crowd howls with approval as they almost cant
believe their eyes

MINI
Lets see it Come on I want to
suck your throbbing member right
now

Troy finally pushes her off humiliated and runs down the
hall as the mob laughs at him Kayla looks at her gratefully
and smiles

appears to be about a three or four story drop

He looks back at Mini He starts to lift a leg over the
railing

Uh that fall probably wont kill
you and considering what a caring
nurturer your wife is I dont
think thats a risk you can afford
to take

It is dark and quiet as the evening dew rises on the lawn
INT MARTIN AND DIANES BEDROOM - LATER

Diane is almost asleep when the phone next to the bed RINGS
waking her up She stares at it for a moment trying to
decide if she should answer it On the forth ring she
answers

and

of

DIANE
Hello

A DIAL TONE rings in her ear She hangs up the phone A

second later it RINGS again She waits two rings and then
answers Again a DIAL TONE

Now a bit freaked Diane is fully awake and staring at the
phone waiting PLINK Something small hits the window

across the room Startled she turns her head towards it

DIANES POV Through the window in the distance by the
hedges a BLACK CLAD FIGURE is visible wearing a ski mask

goggles In the figures right hand there is a gleaming
sharp kitchen knife

She cant believe her eyes

HER POV The figure stands silently bringing the knife up
indicating that hes going to cut her throat

Eyes wild with panic Diane picks up the phone and dials

D
The phone dials and she waits

IANE
Please please oh god

She looks back out the window THE HOODED FIGURE walks out

the bushes and heads towards the house
RECORDED VOICE (V0O)
You have reached 911 if this is an
emergency please remain on the
line

DIANE
Oh god oh god

Diane realizes she doesnt have time to wait and runs out of
the room leaving the phone off the hook

Diane stumbles down the hallway almost tripping on the

steps
down to the living room She goes straight for the phone on
the end table next to the couch She picks it up
RECORDED VOICE (V0O)
Please continue to hold your call

She hangs up the phone and looks back at the hallway but as
she does she sees reflected in a wall mirror ANOTHER BLACK
CLAD FIGURE outside the living room window but this one
holds a HAND AXE
She turns around to look out the window THE FIGURE raises
the axe slowly
DIANE
Nonohelp Help
She heads towards the front door to scream for help but the
axe wielding figure moves swiftly towards the door making
it

unsafe for her to even try Her face dissolves into utter
despair as she stumbles out of the room

INT THE FAMILY DEN - CONTINUOUS
Diane runs in to check that the sliding doors are locked

She
clicks the lock shut just as THE FIRST FIGURE with the
knife
appears in the door frame
DIANE
Oh God Help Someone
Diane is transfixed by her own eyes reflected in the lenses
of the goggles
DIANE
(softly )
No please no
She slowly backs away from the door as the figure tries to
open it The door frame rattles on its track as the figure
D
violently tugs at the handle
IANE
Help Someone please help me
INT THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
She runs back in checking THE WINDOW Its clear She
decides to check the front door She runs over and looks out
the peep hole
PEEP HOLE POV It appears clear
She starts to undo the lock and then slowly peeks through
the
slit in the door leaving the chain on
THROUGH THE SLIT everything looks good

She opens the door and looks towards the front gate which
is
open She looks as if shes thinking of making a dash for
the

gates Just then from behind the gate steps the AXE
WIELDING FIGURE
standing

up

notice

It shakes a finger no at her as it walks towards the

house Terrified she slams the door locking it behind her
She instinctively pushes her back against the door hyper-
ventilating She looks up at the ceiling her eyes filling
with tears

DIANE
Please God please Godplease

She looks around the room searching for options Suddenly
her eyes bulge as she sees THE KNIFE WIELDING FIGURE

not ten feet away in the door to the kitchen

Diane screams and runs back down the hallway towards the
bedroom The knife wielding figure follows behind her She
looks back as it runs after her grabbing her by the
shoulder She shrieks and struggles out of its grasp before
running in the bathroom and slamming the door

INT THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Diane throws her weight against the door struggling to keep
the intruder out She looks for anything to help her and
then sees in the window to the bathroomTHE AXE WIELDING
FIGURE standing silently staring back at her

again at THE WINDOW Its empty The pushing on the door
suddenly stops but Diane is so disturbed she doesnt

through her sobs

They reach the door to the bathroom Its still closed
Martin and Mini exchange a look not believing that Diane
could still be in there

MARTIN

against it He pushes hard on the door opening it a few

inches Mini reaches in and shoves Diane over so they can

Martin lightly taps Dianes cheeks

MARTIN
Diane come on come on

Mini looks up at the counter AN EMPTY BOTTLE OF
PRESCRIPTION
SLEEPING PILLS lies open next to the sink

MINI

Martin
H

e looks up and immediately sees the bottle

MINI
I picked that prescription up three
days ago It was probably more than
half full

The two of them look at each other studying each others
reaction Seconds go by as both wait for the other to make
the first move

MINI
(eerily calm)
I suppose we should call an
ambulance

The suggestion hangs in the air as Martin feels Dianes
wrist again

MARTIN
Her pulse is almost gone

MINI
Do you really think they can save
her

MARTIN

II dont know
MINI

Shell only try it again You know

she will

MARTIN
She will if we keep this torture
up

Martin looks down at Diane

MARTIN
(suddenly with resolve)
This is wrong call an ambulance

MINI
Hold on who are we to say her
choice was wrong She put those
pills in her mouth

MARTIN
Mini--

MINI
Dont Mini me youve been
bankrolling my little project from
day one

MARTIN
We both agreed murder was out

MINI
Id hardly call it murder if
anything were just helping to
fulfill her last wish

MARTIN
She wouldnt have taken the pills
if we hadnt-
(urgently)
Mini for gods sake she still has
a pulse

MINI

Shes got

M

So do people in comas Its just a
matter of time-

MARTIN
Mini we-

MINI
Look you can drop the indignant
outrage because if you really
cared youd have already grabbed
the phone and dialed 911 by now

MINI
(softening)
Cant we just admit how lucky we
are Its the perfect alibi she
put the drugs in her system

MARTIN
What Just leave her here

MINI
Exactly

MARTIN
I dont know

MINI
Can you think of one person she
knows who would say shes sane at
this point This is just the
natural sad and inevitable
conclusion to a tragic life

artin ponders the choice

MINI
Were this close from being
freelets just let nature take

its course

INT THE LIVING ROOM - LATER
Mini and Martin sit watching a game show called Absolutely
Positive

MINI
And so we passed the time watching
my favorite show

CLOSE ON THE TV

A YOUNG MALE GAME SHOW HOST comes out on stage to the
applause of the audience

HOST
Welcome to Absolutely Positive
The show where we give couples
about to get married a last chance
to make sure theyre

He puts a hand to his ear encouraging the studio audience

STUDIO AUDIENCE
Absolutely Positive

HOST
Thats right We send them out on
one last date with someone other
than their fiance so they can be
sure theyre really ready to make
that lifelong commitment

MINI (VO)
Our neighbor Mike Rudell the
scumbag at my birthday produces it
and its so twisted Im surprised
I didnt think of it

On the screen the host introduces THE COUPLE who nervously
walk out to the studio applause

MINI (VO)
Take happy couples about to marry
and try to break them up The catch
is the couples are always sent on
dates with people just a little
better looking than their fiancés

Then the TWO DATES are brought out to sit on either side of
the couple Both dates are indeed slightly better looking
than the engaged couple

INT THE BATHROOM - LATER
Mini checks Dianes pulse

humane thing

Mini stands up

MINI
Its time to speed this up

MARTIN
Speed this up

MINI
We cant wait anymore our alibi is
only believable for maybe another
hour We can say that after dinner
we went to a movie but if she
hasnt croaked by midnight you can
forget about this

Martin looks at her for a long moment clearly realizing the
implications of speed this up

MARTIN
No Im sorry this is going
somewhere Im not prepared to go

MINI
Oh but you were prepared to sit
here until the pills did her in I
hate to break it to you but
wherever you werent prepared to
gothe hypocrite express just
rolled into the station

Martin stares straight ahead coming to grips with the truth
of his actions

MARTIN
What are you suggesting

MINI
Well I thought wed disembowel her
and leave her for the raccoons

Martin recoils

MINI
KiddingGod youve lost your
sense of humor Dont worry itll
be painless

Martin takes a deep breath considering his options
INT DIANES WALK IN CLOSET- MOMENTS LATER

Mini goes through her mothers clothes as Diane lies
crumpled in a heap on the floor Martin looks on
impatiently

in our hearts it would come to
this And as my first assisted
suicide I was going to make it

Mini holds a chic black Chanel suit up to the full length
mirror

Mr Tannen

Martin looks up

MARTIN
Yes

suicide we are required to do an
investigation to rule out homicide

MINI
(exploding)

My mother just killed herself They
havent even taken her away yet
Whats wrong with you

ARTIN

INT THE GARAGE- MOMENTS LATER

Martin stands in the garage with Garson going over what

happened
MARTIN
So after dinner and the movie we
came home at around 1130 and found
her in the garage I turned off the
car and opened the garage door to
let out the exhaust

GARSON
What about trying to revive your

wife
Martin seems a bit taken aback by the question

MARTIN
Of course we did that too but I
couldnt feel a pulse Mini took a
course at school in CPR and tried
that but
(taking a breath)
it didnt work

GARSON
So your wife did this sometime
between 800 and 1133 when you
placed the 911 call

MARTIN
Yes

GARSON
May I ask why you left your wife
alone when she had been acting in
such an unstable state

MARTIN
We never thought shed do anything
likethis After the episode in
the mall Diane hadnt left the
house for three days and my
daughter and I just needed a break
Its been a very stressful time

GARSON
Of course So this was your wifes

Oh wellafter she was brought
home from the mall the car was

towed here and we put it in the

crime lab

happened a year ago

EXT THE BEACH - NIGHT

Mini lies on top of Martin on a lounge chair They both
stare
up at the stars The gentle breaking of waves further adds

to

idea hed decide to come here

MARTIN
He knows He found the clothes and
goggles and he fucking knows

MINI
I doubt he even knows where his
trash cans are

MINI (CONT D)

coincidence

MARTIN
Yeah well coincidence or not he

toying with us

MINI
Just relax what is he going to do

Martin stops and looks at her surprised

MINI
Oh come on could that little
moment between you and Jennifer
have been any more awkward

His face turns a little red

MINI
Im not jealous or anything I just
think its funny Talk about six
degrees of penetration

Martin rubs his temples clearly overwhelmed

MARTIN
You realize he could blackmail us
If the police found out about us
that suicide wouldnt look so
routine

MINI
Martin please calm down Trust
me nothing is going to happen

Her words dont appear to have calmed him

EXT THE POOL - DAY

Martin sits on a lounger reading a book and looking very
unhappy From the pool Mini emerges soaking wet ina
bikini

MINI (VO)
The next few days were a laugh
riot

Martin looks up from the book looking around suspiciously
Suddenly Mini appears behind him and gives him a kiss on

mouth He instinctively pulls back

MINI (VO)
Suddenly Martin was acting like he
really was my father

Just then Rudell and his bimbo enter the pool area waving
at them Minis head is not close enough for the scene to
look incriminating but Martin is too spooked to know the
difference

INT THE TANNENS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Mini and Martin sit watching TV Mini flips channels
stopping at Absolutely Positive Martin snatches the remote
and grumpily changes M

channels Mini looks very annoyed

in

the sequined dress

Detective Garson stands at the door

looking her up and down Mini hides her surprise well

MINI (VO)
Uh oh

MINI

GARSON
Minerva Tannen Detective Garson I
dont know if you remember me

MINI
Drogues my last name is Drogues

the big hearted lug who wanted your
questions answered while my mother
was still warm

GARSON
(ignoring her dig)
So Mr Tannen is your stepfather

MINI
Nice work McGruff

GARSON
Again I am sorry about that night
but it is policy that we get the
preliminary facts as soon as
possible

MINI
What do you want

GARSON
I need to ask you a few more
questions about your mothers
death M
INI
Sure come on in

INT THEIR LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Mini leads him in

Mini and Garson take a seat Mini lights a cigarette

MINI (VO)
I know its stupid as hell to talk
to a cop without a lawyer but I
didnt want to look jumpy and my
first real interrogation I could
feel something tingle deep inside

looks over her outfit again

GARSON
Its a little early for the prom
isnt it

MINI
A girl can dream cant she

GARSON
Perfectly legal So anyway we got
the preliminary coroners report
Although the pills knocked her out
she died of the carbon monoxide
poisoning from the exhaust

MINI
Is it that important

Garson

GARSON
Well its just a little unusual
for a suicide victim to use two
methods Her choices seemed I
dont know how to put it
improvisational

MINI
Well maybe she wanted to drift off
before the fumes got her She
clearly put some thought into that
outfit

GARSON
ClearlyBut dying from carbon
monoxide poisoning is actually
pretty painless you just basically
pass out

MINI
I doubt she would have had an
intimate knowledge of how car fumes
feel when you choke on them

GARSON
I suppose youre rightAlso we
checked the phone records and there
was a 911 call placed at 812 It
was a hang up and when the 911
dispatcher called back a few
minutes later there was no answer

MINI
Really

GARSON
Any idea why shed call 911

MINI (VO)
Okie fine this may be the most
exciting thing Ive done ina
while but even I know when the
rush isnt worth the risk

MINI
Look I think you should come back
when my fathers around Hell be
upset I let a stranger in the
house G

ARSON
I think youre safe with me

MINI
Even so he wont be happy

GARSON
Not a problem will he be home

INT MARTINS OFFICE - DAY
Martin is on the phone

MARTIN
And you let him in

EXT THE POOL - CONTINUOUS

Mini lounges in a bikini talking on the cordless phone
while sucking on a red popsicle

MINI
I played it cool it wouldve
looked worse to be defensive

Mini looks across the yard to see

MIKE RUDELL looking down at her from the upstairs balcony of
his home Hes dressed in a plush terry cloth robe and is
smoking a pipe which he raises in greeting His eyes are
locked on hers

MARTIN (VO)
Well whens he coming over

MINI
Tonight

MARTIN (VO)
Tonight Ive got a dinner with
Chapman Ive already cancelled--
(frustrated)
Damn it Why didnt you call me

RUDELL allows the folds of his robe to open in the breeze
revealing his chest and pair of silk boxers Hes in good
shape for a man his age

MINI
(annoyed)
Hey I didnt know you had plans

Mini responds to Rudells challenge lowering a strap on her
bikini top

MARTIN (VO)
Listen Ill be home early so we
can get the story straight

MINI
Okay

Mini hangs up the phone removing the popsicle slowly from
her mouth

INT THE LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Martin and Mini sit across from Garson Martin appears cool
and relaxed a scotch in his hand

GARSON
I really appreciate you taking the
time to help us out Theres just a
few loose ends we want to tie up

MARTIN
Absolutely What would you like to
know

Garson opens his briefcase and removes a report He starts
G
leafing through papers

ARSON
There appears to be some question
as to the time of death You said
you went to dinner and a movie-

MARTIN
Detective not to be overly
sensitive but do I need my lawyer
here Because these sound like the
questions one asks when theres a
homicide investigation

GARSON
Mr Tannen Id really like to just
finish this up Ive got real
homicides that need attention How
about if I just ask you some
questions and the ones you dont
want to answer well just skip

MINI
That sounds good doesnt it Dad
I mean lets just get this over
with

Martin looks at Mini trying hard not to allow his anger to
escape for a second

MARTIN
Fair enough

GARSON
Terrificnow the preliminary
blood report indicated she had
ritalin in her system

Minis eyes shift between Garson and his note pad

MARTIN
I wasnt aware my wife was taking
ritalin
GARSON
Neither was her physician he had
never prescribed it

MARTIN
Well as you may have discovered by
now my wife had substance abuse
problems Im sure there were many
drugs she took without a
prescription

GARSON

I know but its an odd drug to be
taking Its mostly given to adults
and children with Attention Deficit
Disorder to calm them But in
people who dont need it it has
the reverse effect making them
incredibly hyper and agitated

MARTIN
Again Detective I really cant
say why she was taking these drugs

GARSON
Fair enoughMr Tannen were you
and your wife close

MARTIN
Nowe led for the most part
separate lives We had decided to
stay together for Mini

MINI (VO)
(e)
ohsacrifice personal happiness
for the benefit of the child
Excellent

GARSON
I see

MARTIN
Listen Detective Garson I must
admit I dont see the relevance of
these questions Diane was an

extremely disturbed person Havent

you interviewed enough people who
saw her at her worst

GARSON
Yes but what Im still unclear
about is her time of death

MARTIN
Well that makes two of us
Again detective we were out for
the whole evening

GARSON
(looking at his notes)
After dinner you saw a movie that
night

MARTIN

MINI

prove we stuck those sleeping pills

Would he follow

His face and shoulders glisten with sweat as she lifts one
leg around his waist and then the other As she straddles
him their hips rocking together she puts her arms around
his neck and leans all the way back her hair hanging down
ecstasy

As she pulls herself back up her eyes scan the room

MARTIN stands in the back watching her his eyes sullen

MINI (VO)
Was there any question

Minis eyes move quickly enough past him that its ambiguous
to him whether she spotted him or not

Martin watches as Mini leans in and in SLOW MOTION gives her
partner a deep long kiss MARTIN looks ill

Minis car pulls into the driveway She gets out looking
rumpled

INT AN ELEVATOR - MORNING

Martin rides up in the elevator with other OFFICE WORKERS
His eyes look tired from staying up all night

MINI (VO)
Fake tears asidehe actually was
my first relationship Which in
itself was significant because I
had always felt that by living my
life by the rule of firsts I would
never be able to find someone who
could accept me on those terms

INT MARTINS OFFICE - MORNING

He strides off the elevator sending hellos and nods to his
employees as he passes the large corporate logo BOYD
MATHER TANNEN and ASSOCIATES

MINI (VO)
And I was willing to give him the
chance to be that person

He reaches his desk where his YOUNG SECRETARY LOIS is
waiting with an envelope

together

MARTIN

sitting down He opens the package to find an 8x10 glossy

photo of

MINI SITTING WITH HIM AT THE POOL IN MEXICO The caption
reads THANK HEAVEN FOR LITTLE GIRLS

MINI (VO)
Thats when things started to get
interesting
Martin looks up the empty look in his eyes revealing a

terrified mind already calculating the potential outcomes
He

examines THE ENVELOPE There is a SPEEDWAY COURIER STICKER

but no return address

INT MARTINS CAR - LATER

MATHER

BOYD

Martin sits very still his world crumbling around him
MARTIN
Fifteen yearsweve been--

MATHER
(curtly)
Well be asking all our clients who
they would prefer to stay with and

shot to make your case with them

Martin continues to stare off into space reeling
INT MARTINS CAR - LATER

Martin sits in the traffic on Beverly Glen The veins in his
neck are starting to bulge as he stares straight ahead
Suddenly he starts pounding on the steering wheel

MARTIN

Just then he looks over to the next car A three year old
GIRL in the back seat holds up her PO TELETUBBY DOLL to
show him

bought at Williams Sonoma
M
ARTIN
Im gonna go over there and tell
him to back off or hes gonna get
hurt

MINI
Are you crazy Were not even
positive its him

MARTIN
My god the picture was dropped off
at a messenger service right across
the street from his office He was
the only person at the resort who
knew who we were

MINI
He could go to the cops and tell
them you threatened him then
theyd really start investigating
us Its just one photo and you
cant even really tell if its me

MARTIN
That son of bitch just cost me the
firm I worked fifteen years to
build

MINI
Well if you start waving that
thing around hes gonna cost you a
lot more than that

INT THEIR BEDROOM - LATER
Mini lies awake looking annoyed as Martin keeps turning and
shifting in bed

Martin didnt sleep at all that
night and made damn well sure I
didnt either

EXT THE FRONT DOOR OF MIKE RUDELLS HOUSE - MORNING

MINI (VO)
With Mommy Dearest out of the way
I decided to take the matter of
Rudell into my own hands I knew
Martin wouldnt approve but at
this pointaction had to be
taken

She arrives at the front door and rings the bell

MINI (VO)
I would catch him off guard
disorient him and then kill him

The door opens and Rudell stands before her in the same
plush
bathrobe

MINI (VO)
with kindness

MINI

chair next to PRINCIPAL PATTY ANDREWS 50

Then things got interesting again

Mini immediately sizes up the situation and takes on the
appropriate concerned tone

MINI
Detective Garson is everything all
right

CLOSE ON A VIDEO MONITOR
A

black and white surveillance tape of one of the schools
hallways is seen

GARSON (0S)
Mini this tape was shot a week
before your mothers death

The door to the nurses office is seen opening and Nurse
Hauptflhrer walks out

GARSON (0S)
The next day the school nurse
reported two bottles of Ritalin
missing from the medicine cabinet

A few seconds later Mini is seen entering the nurses
office checking over her shoulder to make sure no one saw
her THE TAPE FREEZES then fast forwards Mini is seen
leaving the office stuffing something in her pocket

INT AN EMPTY CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

A TV and VCR sit on a rolling cabinet in the corner as
Garson puts down the remote and looks at Mini Principal
Andrews is not pleased
GARSON

Weve lifted two prints from the
door and the inside of the medicine
cabinet They dont match the
nurse

PRINCIPAL ANDREWS

Mini is there something youd like
to say to Detective Garson

Mini eyes remain

calm

MINI

Can we see the tape of the Der
Fuhrer sucking down her afternoon
fix of Smirnoff or dont you have
cameras in the bathroom stalls

PRINCIPAL ANDREWS

Young lady stealing anything
especially prescription drugs is a
serious matter

Mini looks at Andrews her eyes suddenly starting to tear

up

MINI

You got me okay But what was I
supposed to do

PRINCIPAL ANDREWS

What do you mean

She
was

Who

MINI
(suddenly hysterical)
-She said if I didnt she
was gonna--

PRINCIPAL ANDREWS

MINI

said she was going to send me to
boarding school in Canada if I

RINCIPAL ANDREWS

MINI
An addict Detective Garson knew
We told him and now what The
whole schools gonna know

Mini hides her face in her hands

MINI
Shes dead my mommys dead Cant

innocence

Andrews casts a harsh glance at a frustrated Garson

PRINCIPAL ANDREWS
Detective Garson I assume there
wont be a need to press charges
against Ms Drogues

Mini holds out her wrists to Garson
MINI
(sniffling)

You gonna cuff me Copper

Garson looks at Mini clearly not convinced of her

GARSON
Shes free to go

INT THE LOBBY OF MARTINS OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Martin gets off the elevator and heads across the lobby
GARSON and A UNIFORMED OFFICER approach him Martin looks a
little unnerved to see them

GARSON
Ah Mr Tannen we were just coming
up to see you Have you got a
minute

MARTIN
Detective I told you no more
questions without my lawyer

GARSON
I think youd better call him

INT AN INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

Martin sits at a table conferring with his lawyer NED
VOLANT an impeccably dressed operator with a mane of thick
heavily gelled hair Garson sits across from them

GARSON
Theres a small discrepancy that I
cant quite figure out and I was
hoping you might be able to explain
it

MARTIN
I suppose I can try

GARSON
The final toxicology report came
back and your wife definitely
didnt die from the pills She
wasnt conscious past 930 but it
was the fumes that killed her

M
ARTIN
Well hallelujah thanks for the
update-

VOLANT
Martin easy

MARTIN
Im sorry but this is harassment

GARSON
See heres what I needed to ask
you The gas tank in the Jag was
almost full just a gallon had been
used

MARTIN
And

GARSON
Well if she was unconscious by
930 that means the car must have
been running for at least two hours
when you found her An unconscious
person cant turn on a car right

VOLANT
Detective with all due respect
could you get to the point

GARSON
Well heres where I get confused
see that particular model idling
for two hours will burn at least
four gallons of gas

Martin tries to remain calm as the panic starts to settle

in
for a long stay
GARSON
So theres really no way the tank
could be almost full if it was
running for two hours Is there
He looks at Martin waiting for an answer

GARSON
So I guess what Im asking is
whose idea was it to put her in the
car

VOLANT
Martin dont say anything

GARSON
Now Mr Tannen you clearly had
the most to gain from her death
but Ive learned from a number of
your wifes friends that she and
Mini had a strained relationship

VOLANT
Again Detective my client wont
be answering anything so lets
just cut the cat and mouse

GARSON
Id like Mr Tannen to know that if
hes trying to be a protective
father by covering up something
Mini did Id be careful The
district attorney is viewing this
case as an opportunity to show the
public that the rich dont get away
with murder in this town

Martin whispers something in Volants ear and he in turn
Vv
whispers back

OLANT
Does this mean hes offering Mr
Tannen immunity if he says he was
protecting his daughter

Garson takes a sip of water as Martin anxiously waits for
his answer

GARSON
Its a strong possibility But he
wants Mr Tannen to know he will go
for the maximum sentence if he
doesnt No manslaughter no plea
bargains nothing

Martins eyes shift slightly

INT ANOTHER INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Garson now finished with Martin sits across from Mini and

her lawyer HERB PELHAM who doesnt look nearly as
confident

as Martins lawyer

MINI
It was Colonel Mustard in the
library with the candlestick

Garson smiles at Mini admiring her resolve

PELHAM
(nervously)
UhMiss Drogues as your lawyer-

MINI
Dont wet your pants I know when
to shut up and swallow

Mini takes out a sip a water letting a trickle of liquid
roll down her chin

MINI
»my tongue

Even Garson appears a little intimidated by the overt
flirtation

GARSON
Look the fact that the marriage
was unhappy and there was no pre-
nup gives all the motive to Martin

MINI
So you want me to say it was his
idea

GARSON

If it was his idea give me one
reason you should take the fall

MINI (VO)
At that moment I knew we had him
If he was trying to get me to rat
on Martin he didnt have enough to
charge either one of us

MINI
So if I tell the jury it was his
idea and I was scared for my life
because he said hed kill me if I
ever told anyone then I walk

Garson instinctively leans forward in his chair just a bit
Mini stares into Garsons eyes unflinching She looks
around
the room weighing her options Pelham attempts to whisper
something in her ear She waves him off
M
INI
Sorry sport but Ill take my
chances

INT MARTINS CAR - LATER

Mini and Martin drive home together There is an icy chill
between them as Martin looks over at Mini

MARTIN
I never doubted for a minute you
were going to hold firm Not a
second I hope you know that

MINI
Oh I knewI knew

MARTIN
Good You realize weve got to
rely on each other

MINI
Who else do we have

MARTIN
Exactly Were almost home free My
lawyer says that gas gauge theory
is circumstantial as hell Ive
only got one concern now
MINI
What

MARTIN
Rudell If a jury knew we were a
couple weve both got a motive and
that changes everything

Mini puts her hand on Martins reassuringly

MINI
Baby dont worry about him hes
just jealous cause youve still
got rockin abs and a better
hairline

Martin looks over at her softening
MINI
Even if he did send that picture
what does it proveNothing
INT THE SHERMAN OAKS GALLERIA - DAY
