INT HIGH SCHOOL GYM - FRESHMAN DANCE - NIGHT

14-YEAR-OLDS bop and grind on the dance floor or nod to the
music on the sidelines dying to be asked We move through
the pure pubescence of it all outside to

INT HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

14-YEAR-OLD CLAIRE cute but way overdressed in a crushed
velvet dress studded with rhinestones She pretends to be
engrossed in a poster of sad cartoon horses surrounding a
dead cartoon horse that says “Drugs Just Say Neigh”

Claire steals glances at 14-YEAR-OLD EMERSON who collects
tickets He’s still figuring out what look he’s going for and
not pulling off any of them preppy sweater wallet chain
fedora When a big group enters Claire makes her move

YOUNG CLAIRE
Oh hi Emerson I didn’t see you
there or remember that you were
taking tickets from eight to nine
It probably slipped my mind while I
was thinking about art

YOUNG EMERSON
Whoa really I do a lot of art

YOUNG CLAIRE
We have so much in common Do you
want me to keep you company

YOUNG EMERSON
Sure

She takes the folding chair beside him They sit in silence

YOUNG CLAIRE
You know Janet’s party next month

YOUNG EMERSON
Yeah I heard we’re going to make
candles

YOUNG CLAIRE
I heard that too We should like
go together To the party
YOUNG EMERSON
Yeah that’d be awesome Cool
cool cool It’s triple cool

They both grin then look anywhere but at each other

YOUNG CLATRE
You know what would be so cute If
we slow danced out here

YOUNG EMERSON
Ok

They get up fumble their way into each other’s arms and sway
to the muffled music

YOUNG CLAIRE
I feel really comfortable with you
You can ask me anything

She looks up at him with big hopeful eyes and nods slightly

YOUNG EMERSON
Claire Will you be my girlfriend

Claire beams More kids enter and Emerson rushes back to the
table suppressing a grin of his own A CRYING GIRL and her
friends burst out of the gym It’s ugly hiccupping crying

CRYING GIRL
He just went And danced With
Lydia Pierce And I Am feeling
So Much Emotion

Claire looks from the girl to Emerson and back
YOUNG CLAIRE
I’m never going to be single again
INT TINY NEW YORK APARTMENT - DAY
We pan across photos in skillfully crafted handmade frames

-Claire and Emerson after the prom She wears his jacket and
is mid-twirl dancing in a parking lot

cups but Emerson pours Claire wine into a personalized glass
(initials lions wearing hair bows unicorns in neck ties)

-Emerson sits at a desk in the library Claire stands at the
center of a semicircle an acapella study break serenade
Claire is belting something out Emerson loves it Loves her
Past the photos we find

CLAIRE AT 24 preppy and EMERSON AT 24 hipster clicking
personalized glasses of cheap champagne

CLAIRE
I don’t have to go

EMERSON
Yeah you do This is your dream
And we’re gonna make it Because I
love everything about you

CLAIRE
Even my stupid ambition that’s
taking me to stupid California

EMERSON
Even that

Emerson hugs Claire like he’s never letting go

INT SUSHI RESTAURANT - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY

CLAIRE CUSHING 27 headband matches her manicure addresses
an unseen male companion across the table Claire is the
worst kind of romantic not hopeless but unflinchingly
hopeful She doesn’t just wear her heart on her sleeve she
wears every other internal organ as well

CLAIRE
Long distance sucks We knew that
going in But I don’t have any
doubt that we’re doing the right
thing Because when you find
something this good you hold onto
it I know you feel the same way

But she’s not talking to Emerson Her date HUNTER stares
back puzzled

CLAIRE (CONTD)
And Manhattan Beach isn’t that far

HUNTER
Maybe well wait to discuss that
at least until date number two

CLAIRE
Youre so practical You’re gonna
make a great dad

CLAIRE (CONTD)

My boyfriend -- sorry ex-
boyfriend a year later and I still
have trouble with it -- he’s great

with kids He lives in New York
That’s the only reason we broke up
the distance I’m not gonna lie
Hunter there are still some
feelings there but obviously there
will be until I’m in a new
relationship

She puts her hand on the table Glances at it suggestively

CLAIRE (CONTD)
Do you not hold hands or something

She signals to the WAITER Turns to Hunter

CLAIRE (CONTD)
Ill have a Diet Coke

He double takes Is she really asking him to order for her

HUNTER
She’1l have that I’1l1 have an
Asahi You want a beer Sake

CLAIRE
I’m not eating certain kinds of
gluten right now Including rice

The waiter gives Hunter a concerned glance before leaving
HUNTER
Oh ok Actually I did the Paleo-
diet for a while It was intense

Claire laughs way too hard Hunter looks around what

CLAIRE
You’re so funny I love you

They both freeze

CLAIRE (CONTD)
I don’t I didn’t mean But we
are 98 compatible according to the
old internet there so I could love
you and just not know it yet

Their drinks arrive Hunter takes a long sip of his beer
CLAIRE (CONTD)
So next month is my best friend’s
wedding -- favorite movie by the
way You should totally come with
me Obviously you’d want to meet
Nadia and Aaron first They’1l love
you I think they have next
Thursday free for dinner if you
want to do a little double date

HUNTER
Maybe What do you do for a living

CLAIRE
I work at an auction house God
this is so easy I could talk to
you all night Just talk Cuddle
Maybe pull up something on Netflix
and just laugh and be together

She takes his hand while it’s still holding his beer

CLAIRE
Uncharted territory yes It is
making me super sad It’s like
look how much you could save on
this wine tasting Or this romantic
getaway Or this segway tour I
can’t go on a segway tour by
myself

NADIA
And you can’t go with me because I
would never go on a segway tour

Since her hands are full of flowers the baker ties the
string from the box to Claire’s bracelets

CLAIRE
My life would be so much better
with a boyfriend I would know so
much about wine And the history of
the Santa Monica coastline only
29 may purchase additional as
gifts

NADIA
Veto Claire you’ve got to relax
You can’t rush a relationship

Claire kisses the baker goodbye and walks briskly to her car
where she struggles to load everything in

CLAIRE
I’m not I’m just being nice I’m
following my heart And I’m showing
them how great a girlfriend I am
It worked on Emerson
NADIA
When you were fourteen Remember
you always find love when you’re
not looking for it Like me and
Aaron when I randomly went to that
young Jewish medical professionals

to look for it See you in 20

Nadia holds up her own beautiful engagement ringed finger
over the partition while rolling her eyes at Claire

NADIA
Holler back girl Get yours

She is literally the dumbest She
asked if I was Beyonce’s twin

CLAIRE
When clearly you look like Rihanna
Or Vivica A Fox Or the one other
black person she’s ever seen

Margot and Daphne appear over the partition They’ve
downshifted into their most pitying smiles

DAPHNE
We feel bad We shouldn’t be all

sit back down until Nadia puts her fist up too Nadia gives
the air a quick punch then gets back to work

Claire takes out a piece of monogrammed stationary and begins
a thank-you note in lovely cursive French

NADIA
Claire I got a phone call while
you were on your way in

CLAIRE
Cool I love phone calls

Claire’s fountain pen bleeds a drop of ink It’s still fine
but it’s not perfect Claire crumples up the note and tosses
it in the trash with a flick of her wrist She starts over

NADIA

Claire looks up

Why are you looking at me like you
looked at that picture of Daphne’s
puppy in a tiny wheelchair

NADIA
Emerson’s coming to the wedding

Claire looks back down at her thank-you note

uninvite him--

Oh Well great Because now I just
definitely will have a boyfriend by
the time you get married

NADIA
You could say you have a boyfriend
Who’s in the Marines and a flautist
and a classy stripper Your own

the problem Nadia You know what

I’ve got a date tonight I’m
absolutely 110 fine

chill about it

personally find trying as hard as
that outfit exhausting But power
to you It’s awesome that you spend
all that time and energy finding
these dates and dressing up and
trying to make it something but
what if it’s a miserable failure

CLAIRE
Then that sucks But if it’s not
It’s the best thing ever

CLAIRE
Don’t quit your day job Except
quit your day job because you hate
it But also don’t go into
professional impersonations

JAKE
What did I say about the talking

CLAIRE
To do less of it

JAKE
We’re so young We’ve got time
You’re not going to be alone
forever just because you don’t find
a boyfriend this second So relax

JAKE (CONTD)
Think of it like this you know
when a guy doesn’t call and it
makes you like him more

CLAIRE
I hate that

JAKE
Ok youre the guy talking is
calling and the game is the other
girl you assume the guy’s with when
he doesn’t get in touch

CLAIRE
What if I just tell him I think
he’d look great in purple He
would I want to buy him shirts

JAKE
No you don’t You don’t even care
about shirts Because no guy wants
a girl who wants to dress him up
Get back on the horse

Jake signals for her to cut it off but Claire’s on a roll
CLAIRE (CONTD)
I mean yes I get insecure don’t
we all But I don’t care I’m
pretty relaxed about all the inner
turmoil Do I worry about being
alone forever Who doesn’t
constantly worry about that
Robots Am I right So fine I am

Come on you’re romantic Remember
I saw your movie

JAKE

pretentious guys in bands We could

money it takes time If it’s bad
it’s embarrassing

CLAIRE

thing ever

Jake laughs and shakes his head

CLAIRE (CONTD)
What It is Oh I get it “look at
me I’m Jake I’m giving Claire
noncommittal responses and
condescending looks instead of
going after my dreams because
trying is gay I’m so cool that I
was wearing skinny jeans in 1998”

They look at each other expectantly Like the end of a date

project I find it admirable that
you want to reform yourself And

role model of me

TAYLOR (CONT’D)
So I’m going to give you a few
pointers and the first one is
don’t talk all nervous like that

It’s more than that Guys like a
girl with a sense of humor

CLAIRE
I know I’m very good at laughing

She demonstrates It’s the fakest thing ever

JAKE
Oh God That’s something you need
to stop immediately

TAYLOR
Laughing doesn’t make you funny
Being funny makes you funny

CLAIRE
I’m not funny I’m nice I’m smart
I bake amazing cookies

TAYLOR
Don’t tell me you’re good at
puzzles too This is just
embarrassing how desperate you are

CLAIRE
You know what I’m a puzzle master
And I’m proud of it And I’m proud
of being thoughtful and romantic
and all I’m trying to do is get a
foot in the door so I can be with
someone who likes all this stuff
about me Not change just foot in
the door Because if you want
something you do whatever it takes
to get it You move across the
country for a job You get dates on
the internet You wear baseball
hats even though you have a
beautiful head of hair That’s not
desperate It’s making your life
what you want it to be

SORORITY GIRL
Send ‘em back bitches

BEN

you And you know how your partner
there said it was probably because
he was busy or freaked out by how
much he liked you or he lost his
cell phone She was lying to make
you feel better He didn’t call
because you’re not that cute and
your vagina feels like poison But
you kind of knew that anyway

The sorority girl bursts into tears and storms off The
friend follows A flicker of guilt Claire shakes it off

CLAIRE (CONTD)

Claire leads Jake in Cool and cavernous and crates
everywhere Jake takes in his surroundings

CLAIRE
This is my favorite place in the
building Maybe in all of LA

JAKE
It’s amazing

CLAIRE
Everything here has a past But all
that matters when it comes here is
where it’s going Maybe it’s going
to someone who’s been watching it
for years Maybe it’s someone who
just saw it for the first time
today and doesn’t even understand
why they don’t ever want to take
their eyes off it Whatever it is
we match them up Like this one--

She unsnaps the hinges on a crate and gently peels back some
paper to reveal a still life of dead ducks and fruit It’s
awful Gory and boring at the same time

CLAIRE (CONTD)

Nobody famous did it The subject
matter is iffy It won’t sell
for much But the seller doesn’t
care she thinks it’s hideous and
she’s a little bit right But she’s
totally wrong for someone Someone
is going to look at this painting
and say “I’ve found it” There’s
something here that’s interesting
and haunting and traditional and
weird Someone’s going to see that

JAKE
It’s romantic

CLAIRE
I don’t know It might never sell

JAKE
It will

CLAIRE
I hope so

They look at each other Smile

Nadia sees Taylor watching Jake and Claire

NADIA
There’s nothing to worry about

TAYLOR
Them I’m not the jealous type

NADIA
Me neither Cause my fiancee knows
I’1l cut him if he looks at another

pumpkin seeds So addictive I got
to give Claire props

TAYLOR

Jake exits his place looking a mess

JAKE
I heard your shoes

CLAIRE
Ben and I are official

Jake opens his mouth No words come out

CLAIRE (CONTD)
How are you doing

She walks toward his apartment

JAKE
Thanks again for making me put
myself out there Oh wait no it
was humiliating and terrible

CLAIRE
I’m sorry you feel that way But I
put myself out there and it worked
So you know keep at it

JAKE
Taylor and I broke up

CLAIRE
Oh my God Jake Why

JAKE
She met someone else

CLAIRE
Weren’t you someone else

JAKE
This guy won’t even kiss her until
she’s single She hates prudes It
makes zero sense

CLAIRE
Maybe it’s for the best

JAKE
You think someone is a certain kind
of person and you trust them
No you know what it is I’ve just
never met an honest girl

CLAIRE
What

JAKE
Taylor acted straightforward but
she’s a bitch You’re lying to Ben
Girls just lie

CLAIRE
So you’re insulting me because
Taylor met someone who wasn’t just
trying to get into her pants

JAKE
No

CLAIRE
You got hurt once so now we’re all
whores right Do you know how many
guys have lied to me Cheated on
me Treated me like absolute shit
(MORE )

CLAIRE (CONTD)
But no I’m the liar I’m a bitch
really because I followed your
advice

JAKE
Well I was wrong

He kisses her She pushes him away

CLAIRE
What are you doing

JAKE
What

CLAIRE
I’m with Ben

JAKE
He’s wrong for you

CLAIRE
Taylor is my friend

JAKE
Come on You like me right

CLAIRE
You want me to give up my
relationship to be your rebound

JAKE
No Claire I’m into you too

CLAIRE
Now that Taylor’s not an option

JAKE
I’m trying here

CLAIRE
No You’re not It’s just now that
Taylor’s gone you think you can
casually make your way into another
non-relationship It doesn’t work
that way You can’t act like you
don’t care and then suddenly decide
you do You can’t start caring when
the wedding is in two weeks and I
finally have a boyfriend You can’t
do that You can’t--

He kisses her again She allows herself a few seconds Then

CLAIRE (CONTD)
I can’t Because even though we’re
in our twenties and we’re supposed
to make mistakes I know what I
want I don’t want casual I want
to care And you don’t

She walks away He watches her walk into her apartment

INT CLAIRE’S APARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Claire closes the door Waits for a knock that doesn’t come
CLAIRE
He didn’t even try to follow you
He didn’t even try
INT JAKE’S APARTMENT - DAY

CLAIRE

It’s a non-issue I’m with Ben
TAYLOR

Ugh
CLAIRE

wouldn’t risk that

TAYLOR
Yes you would

Claire freezes

TAYLOR (CONT’D)

The Claire I know follows her
heart She goes after what she
wants She takes risks and she
loves love and she has moon sex
What happened to moon sex

CLAIRE
It was foolish and unrealistic I’m
being a good friend here
TAYLOR
No you’re being scared and
annoying and using me as an excuse
and I can’t deal with this shit I
don’t need you as my friend
She hangs up
Claire stares at the phone bewildered
Taylor walks inside upset but trying to shake it off
TAYLOR (CONTD)
This is why I hate girls
INT AN ABELL AUCTION HOUSE - CLAIRE’S DESK - DAY

The sadness is gone as Claire regales a disinterested Nadia

CLAIRE
Im all “I don’t care” And he’s
all “be with me” Who’s the jam

NADIA
Is it you

CLAIRE
And now Jake is trying to tell me
were “supposed to be together” and
I’m like could you be any gayer

NADIA
Jake’s nice

CLAIRE
Oh now you like him You could be
happy for me by the way

NADIA
Yeah can’t wait for Ben to be your
date at my wedding It’ll really
make Emerson jealous when you two
start grinding to Stevie Wonder

CLAIRE
Are you even going to give hima
chance tonight or are you just
going to be a bitch

NADIA
Because that’s not a leading
question No I can’t wait for
dinner tonight Because you guys
are so fun right

INT TAPAS RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Nadia and her fiancee AARON sit across from Ben and Claire
double date Everyone studies their menu in silence

CLAIRE
Ben’s very excited for the wedding

BEN
It sounds very “classy”

NADIA
I’m sorry is that funny

BEN
Neither of us is into frilly shit
I mean you know Claire

AARON
Do you know Claire

CLAIRE
Let’s order I’m fucking starving

BEN
Small plates are such a scam Cause
they never give you bread you
know

NADIA
Claire and I love this place When
we lived around here we’d come all
the time Bottle of wine cheese
plate pretending to be glamorous

CLAIRE
It was a stretch for me Ha

BEN
Explain something to me Nadia

NADIA
Anything

BEN
Why do girls who don’t eat surround
themselves with food Like you and
your cheese plate Or what was
that woman party you told me about
Claire Was that Nadia’s

AARON
Which the bachelorette party I’m
not gonna lie that sounded kind of
awesome I was like where are my
cupcake strippers

NADIA
Absolutely nowhere I hope

BEN
Yeah the cupcakes What is that
You all whine about not wanting to
be fat for a wedding and then
every single event before it
involves cupcakes You’re either
going to throw them away or throw
them up It’s fucking wasteful

NADIA
Wow you’re so in touch with the
female psyche You get us Ben
BEN
Claire and I were laughing about
that cause who thinks that’s a
good idea for a party It’s drama
waiting to happen “Wah I ate so
much and the stripper never called
me” If you’re with fun people all
you need is some beer Your
party Who even puts their time
into some ordeal like that

AARON
Yeah who indeed

NADIA
You know I forget Who planned
that stupid party for months Who
color-coded it to match the wedding
invitations Who did that Claire

Everyone looks to Claire

CLAIRE
Wasnt it your cousin Jenna

NADIA
My Cousin Jenna Jenna Yes
surprisingly I’m not the whitest
person in my family because I have
a cousin named Jenna who invented
the concept of cupcake strippers
and then spent months finding ones
that weren’t germy or creepy or
loud or ugly

CLAIRE
And that was just the cupcakes

NADIA
Fuck you

The guys are taken aback

NADIA (CONTD)

Jenna is amazing She is just
classic girlfriend material The
kind of friend every woman wants I
wish I could hang out with my
cousin Jenna all the time

CLAIRE
Well you can’t because she has a
life too

(MORE)
CLAIRE (CONTD)
She can’t just run around all mousy
and obliging and making your life
her priority

BEN
So are we getting food or what

Nadia gets up and walks out Aaron follows her

BEN (CONTD)
What just happened

CLAIRE
-Bitches be crazy

INT BEN’S CAR - NIGHT
Ben and Claire eat fast food in silence

BEN
Listen I don’t exactly know what
happened in there but I do know
you’re 50 times cooler than her

CLAIRE
I’m really not

BEN
You’re hot You’re funny And you
don’t even know it

CLAIRE
And you’re actually sweet

Ben puts his hand on her leg It’s natural intimate And

then it starts creeping up her leg

BEN
Who wants to have an orgasm while
she eats a burger

Claire forces a laugh
BEN (CONTD)
You don’t have to be embarrassed
In-N-Out at In-N-Out So you

Claire considers Ben She puts down her burger

CLAIRE
No it’s not That’s not me

BEN
Ok

CLAIRE

I would have rather had the small
plates I like looking at cupcakes
during parties I cry at the end of
any movie starring Kate Hudson and
the beginning of every episode of
“Millionaire Matchmaker” I like
nail polish and sangria and your
hand is still between my legs when
I’m trying to have a conversation

Ben removes his hand

CLAIRE (CONTD)
I’m a nice girl I want us to be
nice us and not just in private
With my friends too You’re a nice
guy when you try So try

BEN
Don’t tell me how to act What’s
even going on here

CLAIRE
I saw the way guys treated Taylor
And I tried being a little more
like her just for the beginning
But it worked out because you found
your nice girl

BEN
You’re not that nice You tricked
me into being with you

CLAIRE
You never would have liked me if I
hadn’t acted that way initially

BEN
Guess what I don’t like you now

He starts the engine

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
Claire gets out of Ben’s car She leans in the open window

with a mini white peach sangria and a micro brownie

Claire and Nadia feast on small plates

CLAIRE
I know I shouldn’t care God I’m
pathetic Can I please hear about
your life because it’s a thousand
times more interesting and I’ve
been the worst lately

NADIA

Yes but wait a sec You’re not
pathetic because you want love You
know that right The only reason I
ever told you to chill out about it
is that I know it’ll happen for
you Not because you shouldn’t want
it And what about Jake Even I
think he’s kind of perfect for you

CLAIRE
If he were perfect for me he’d
want to be with me

NADIA
You’re ok with that

CLAIRE
It’s not about finding someone
It’s about finding someone who
makes you happy Chasing a guy and
trying to tie him down that’s not
going to make me happy even if
it’s Jake But hey at least I get
to go pick up Emerson and Petra at
the airport Oh wait

TAYLOR
I’ve never been a bridesmaid I’m
too real for most girls

Nadia rolls her eyes

TAYLOR (CONTD)

Manners or female friends But I
like Claire Hey could you tell

bears with the chairs One was too
big One was too small One was too
soft One was too hard But one was

INT CLAIRE’S PRIUS - DAY
It’s getting harder and harder for Claire to smile

EMERSON
Claire’s probably too busy with her
super cool life to have a boyfriend
anyway right Claire

CLAIRE
Yeah super cool

They don’t notice her sarcasm

PETRA
Well I’m so uncool I went back to
school Again

CLAIRE
For what

PETRA
A PhD in hip hop culture I know
it doesn’t sound like a real
degree but after being a lawyer
for a bit I realized it wasn’t my
thing And I was dancing in these
rap videos for fun and somehow used
that to convince Harvard to give me
a free ride for a third time

CLAIRE
You’re in Boston Emerson is in New
York You’re doing long distance

The pause is deafening

EMERSON
It’s not that far

PETRA
When you meet the right person it
changes how you feel about things
like that It does make you a
better version of yourself so

Claire pulls the car over
PETRA (CONTD)

In this case it made Emerson
capable of a long distance--

CLAIRE
Get out

EMERSON
What

CLAIRE

Get out of the Prius Call a cab
like normal people who don’t accept
rides from their ex-girlfriend Or
people who tell their ex they’re
engaged as if I wouldn’t find out
Social media is everywhere
Emerson Twitter is real Congrats
by the way but come on

EMERSON
Thanks I should have called you

CLAIRE
And I shouldnt have offered you a
ride Because I do have a super
cool life So why am I wasting my
time pretending I’m fine with this
Why would I pretend anything when
my life is actually pretty amazing
So have a lovely trip Take
pictures Don’t make me look at
them And seriously get out

Emerson considers Claire He opens his door
EMERSON
Fair enough God You haven’t

changed at all It’s awesome

CLAIRE
Yeah It is Now leave

They get out Get their bags Petra pops her head back in

PETRA
This was truly a delight I’m
really excited to continue this
conversation at the wedding

Claire watches them in the mirror then pulls out into the
road She flips the radio from pretentious indie rock to her
favorite soft rock station KOST 1035 It’s an ad for the
station with a medley of songs Claire sings along

CLAIRE
I am beautiful no matter what they
say Its too late to apologize
Making love out of nothing at all
Maybe next time hell think before
he cheats Dont stop Believing

TAYLOR (CONTD)
Here’s a question why am I going
to Nadia’s wedding in the seat
reserved for Claire’s plus one

Because the universe hates me
(off her look)
Claire hates me

TAYLOR
So Man the fuck up and woo the
shit out her

JAKE
It’s not that easy

TAYLOR
How was I ever attracted to you
You need an annual pap smear you’re
such a pussy Which by the way
just had and we’re clean Up top

Jake gives her a high five

He smiles

JAKE
Always liked your honesty Among
plenty of other things

TAYLOR
Are you trying to have breakup sex

JAKE
No

TAYLOR

K cool You know I like romantic
shit with Derek And not because I
have to force myself to like it I
just do You liked me because I
didn’t make you do that stuff You
liked Claire cause she made you
want to I get it now Cause I
like feel it or whatever

JAKE
Sorry

TAYLOR
It’s supposed to be that way It’s
why I knew I had to give things a
shot with Derek And it’s why
youre a fucking dumbass if you

JAKE
Taylor I don’t care

TAYLOR
How’s that working out for you You
know a wise woman once told me

CLAIRE (CONTD)
So hi

Emerson stands to hug her

EMERSON
Good to see you again

CLAIRE
I honestly want to catch up but I

EXT BEACHSIDE WEDDING - DAY

Claire holds Nadia’s bouquet eyes wet and smile huge as

DAPHNE
It’s so ironic

MARGOT
She looks just like she did in
“Dreamgirls”

EXT BEACHSIDE WEDDING - DAY

Claire poses for photos with the rest of the wedding party
She’s genuinely happy as she watches Nadia and Aaron Further
down the beach Emerson and Petra are ankle deep in the

NADIA

CLAIRE
Aaron
NADIA
Please don’t tell him that just

INT JAKE’S APARTMENT - DAY

Jake lies on the couch surrounded by beer cans and empty
pudding cups The DVD menu of “The Royal Tenenbaums” plays
He looks around at the trash and the nail polish and the
despair He lets out a little laugh

Jake opens his computer He plays the music video

Jake laughs a little Then a little more It builds slowly
into an all-out guffaw

He stops when he sees Claire’s ugly still life painting

He looks at his watch He leaps up

INT WEDDING RECEPTION - DAY

Claire dances with Margot and Daphne Plenty of GUYS eye her
but she’s having too much fun to notice Emerson appears

EMERSON
May I have this dance

He initiates a perfect waltz Throughout their conversation
they dance in ways that the rest of us only dream of

CLAIRE
I’m sorry About the car

EMERSON
It’s ok You know after you I
thought I’d never find anyone

CLAIRE
Really But you’re such a catch

EMERSON
Have you met you The thing about
Petra was I knew if I could feel
like that when I had someone as
great as you to compare her to it
was real You’re gonna have that

CLAIRE
You know what I agree I will

He twirls her

CLAIRE (CONTD)
Nobody will ever dance like you

EMERSON
No they won’t But you’1l find
someone who’s better than dancing

He kisses her hand and moves elegantly toward Petra

All Petra knows how to do is sway in place But Emerson
couldn’t be happier Claire and Petra share a smile

Claire meanders back to her table stopping to grab a glass
of champagne from a tray to tousle a FLOWER GIRL’S angelic
curls to kiss someone hello Content

She takes her seat At the empty place setting there’s now a
plastic bin of nail polish Claire double takes

And that’s when she hears it the first few chords of All-4-
One’s “I Can Love You Like That” the song Claire and Jake
belted out in the car Claire blanches

Someone is singing and he’s not singing very well

JAKE (0S)
They read you Cinderella you hoped
it would come true

(MORE)

JAKE (0S) (CONTD)
That one day your Prince Charming
would come rescue you You like
romantic movies and you never will
forget the way you felt when Romeo
kissed Juliet

Claire moves through the crowd pushing toward the stage
trying to see what we see Jake a nervous wreck singing his
heart out in a white tux as the BAND smirks

JAKE (CONTD)
I can love you like that I would
make you my world Move heaven and
earth if you were my girl

He closes his eyes to avoid the stares of the wedding guests
and to get more into it He sweats

And that’s what Claire sees standing on her tip toes What
the evidence pointed to but she didn’t allow herself to hope

JAKE (CONTD)
I would give you my heart Be all
that you need Show you youre
everything thats precious to me
If you give me a chance I can
love you like that

He opens his eyes But all he can see are the blinding
lights The music plays on but Jake doesn’t sing The crowd
starts to come into focus as Jake’s eyes adjust

JAKE (CONTD)
Hi Nadia’s wedding Sorry

Nadia and Aaron are not sorry they are thrilled
JAKE (CONTD)
I had to see you Claire If you’re

here hopefully This is me trying

Jake searches the crowd for Claire He doesn’t see her making
her way through the crowd

JAKE (CONTD)
I had to I’m only in my twenties
I’m way too young for regrets

Emerson and Petra watch riveted

PETRA
Is this performance art

EMERSON
Either way it’s very fresh

JAKE
I have no right to put you in this
position Seriously guys when she
rejects me don’t blame her If I
fail it’s going to suck But
here’s the thing what if I don’t

Claire beams up at him but he still can’t see her

JAKE (CONTD)
It would be the best thing ever
Because you’re perfect and you’re
perfect for me and I want to try
as hard as I can to make sure you
know that But even if you do say
no please please don’t ever let a
guy change you ever again

The filler background music is the only sound the crowd is
silent Claire reaches the stage

CLAIRE
Good try Now stop making this
ridiculous grand gesture and God-
awful speech and kiss me

Jake leaps off stage and gives Claire the kind of kiss girls
dream about their whole lives And boys too if they’d ever
admit it A jazz SAXOPHONIST continues the song

Claire pulls out of the epic kiss

JAKE
What’s wrong

CLAIRE
Isn’t there a game on I’m very
into sports and nothing else So
thanks for the make out bro
She starts to walk away Then turns back
CLAIRE (CONTD)
But whatever We could slow dance
or some shit I don’t care

Jake and Claire kiss again as we

FADE OUT
