WALTER presses a button and the TVS fill with football
games

WALTER
Thats every pro game played last Sunday

climb
out of the hole before paying their bookies on Tuesday
Sports
bettings illegal in 49 states including this one but

what

we do is 100 legal -- its exactly the same as a stock
broker

only instead of touting stocks we advise people on how
to bet

We make the big money off our client list You see
when a

client wins with our advice we take a percentage which
they

gladly give to keep getting our picks When they lose
we get

zip So the object here my tall athletic religious
friend

-- is to win

death

inherently defective in you And you And me All of

We look like everyone else but were defective because
most people make a bet they want to win while we the
gamblers of the world were subconsciously playing to
All humans like going to the edge of the abyss but
us different is we go all the way and hurl ourselves
the void And we like doing it so much we do it time
after time Me I always felt most alive when they
away the chips and every one here knows what Im

People like us even when we win its just a matter
before we give it all back But when we lose and I
kind of loss that makes your asshole pucker to the size
decimal point theres a moment when youre standing
youve just recreated the worst possible nightmare this
of malignant cancer for the 20th goddamn time and you
realize -- hey Im still here Im still breathing
alive In order to really live you have to be aware of
own mortality -- and a losing bet of a certain size is
the best ways

I know of getting that feeling When you win you defy
but when you lose

you survive it and thats remarkable
