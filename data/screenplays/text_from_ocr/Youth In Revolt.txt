YOUTH IN REVOLT

Written by

Gustin Nash

July 13 2007

OVER BLACK comes the sound of deep HEAVING BREATHS Moist

FLESH FLAPPING accompaniment Someone is beating off

A pause as the someone turns the page of a magazine

The beating off resumes at a quickened pace The SQUEAKING
of

bed springs joins in

Another page is turned Feverish THUMPING until a MALE VOICE

lets out a quiet MOAN

The breathing gradually slows to normal and lets out a

relieved sigh of finality

NICK (VO)
My name is Nick

NICK TWISP 16 stares up at the ceiling Hes glassy eyed
from the exertion

INT NICKS ROOM - DAY

Ssprawled on the bed trousers around his ankles a well
thumbed issue of Penthouse covers his privates

NICK (VO)
My last name which I loath is
Twisp

Nick pulls up his trousers and leaps off the bed He pulls
the drawer under his mattress out

NICK (VO)
The next thing you should know
about me is that I am obsessed with
sex

A view of the drawer reveals it to be filled with neatly
filed issues of Penthouse and Hustler He puts the most
recently utilized magazine in its place
NICK (VO)
Lately I have become morbidly
aware of my penis

Nick posing in front of the mirror pants around his ankles
again He looks at himself from various angles

NICK (VO)
Once a remote region accessed
indifferently for micturition it
has developed overnight into a
gaudy Las Vegas of the body

We PAN DOWN and where Nicks crotch is supposed to be
there
is a hole in the screen leading us to

LAS VEGAS OF THE BODY

The pulsing neon sign outside the club reads NICKS PENIS
We fly inside where we find a star-studded floor show
Drunken CONVENTIONEERS make out with STRIPPERS A LEOPARD
leaps through a burning HOOP on stage

INT NICKS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Nick typing on an obsolete PC

NICK (VO)
I am entering the tenth grade at
St Vitus Academy which I am
told is the most rigorous prep
school in the East Bay Hopefully I
will be invited to join Miss
Satrons English Literature class

A view of the books and CDs on his shelf
NICK (VO)
I am a voracious reader and listen
to Frank Sinatra So needless to
say I am still a virgin

Follow the curser on the monitor as he types the words -

STILL A VIRGIN
He pauses in thought then continues

NICK (VO)
I have yet to hold hands with a
girl let alone have my winkie up
her wendell

INT AIRPLANE (35000 FT) - DAY

WE MOVE down an airplane aisle past PASSENGERS sleeping and
chatting

NICK (VO)
I am an only child except for my
big sister Joanie who has left the
bosom of her family to sling hash
at 35000 feet

We reach the end of the aisle where a buxom twenty-
something JOANIE TWISP serves a beverage

INT ESTELLES KITCHEN - DAY

Liver frying in a pan ESTELLE TWISP 43 cooks and puffs on
a cigarette at the same time

NICK (VO)
Mom gives drivers tests at the
Department of Motor Vehicles
Nick sits at the kitchen table reading the paper He watches
with nausea as Estelle piles liver onto his plate

NICK (VO)

She used to keep Dad up to date on

all the motor statutes he was

violating This is one of the

reasons they got divorced
JERRY early 40s saunters in wearing a TRUCKERS DO IT IN
OVERDRIVE shirt and boxers His gut hangs over the elastic
but he is completely devoid of an ass

NICK (VO)
Moms boyfriend Jerry is a long
distance trucker though his
ultimate ambition is to be on state
disability
Jerry absently smacks Estelles butt Waddles over to the
breakfast table He snatches the Funnies from the paper in
Nicks hands

NICK (VO)
Ive been struggling to think of a
commendable thing to say about
Jerry
Jerry gives an asinine chuckle at the cartoon Nick glares

NICK (VO)
No luck His grey matter registers
at cretin and the needle doesnt
budge

EXT GEORGE TWISPS HOME - DAY

GEORGE TWISP 41 scruffy and greying waters the foliage
outside the house with a high powered hose

NICK (VO)
Dad is a copywriter for
agricultural magazines
In the drive Nick slaves over the duty of washing the rims
of his dads BMW 325i

NICK (VO)
Hed like to own a more prestigious
model of BMW but as he often
reminds me he is burdened with
crippling child support payments

Nick glances up and spots LACEY 20 coming up the drive

toward him in a weensy bikini Her body has more
outcroppings

than the coastline of Albania

She continues past him and embraces George

NICK (VO)
Lacey is Dads latest bimbette She
is twenty and a recently minted
alumna of Stanfort
Super (Stanfort Institute of Cosmetology)
George and Lacey exchange saliva shamelessly Nick turns his
attention back to the Beamer
As the making out becomes heated groping Georges grip on
the hose slackens
Nick gets blindsided by the jet of water

INT NICKS ROOM - DAY

Were back with Nick as he types on his computer He looks
down at the tent in his boxers

CUT TO
He pulls open the drawer again - the pornography collection

NICKS POV
of the room shaking accompanied by his heavy breathing His
eyes float from the Hustler to the pink walls of his room

NICK (VO)
My mother is the one who painted my
room to look like Dolly Partons
boudoir She read this color was
used in hospitals to calm mental
patients
Nick closes his eyes his right arm moving rhythmically

NICK (VO)
Ill tell you what I told her I am
not mentally ill
BLACKNESS The masturbation reaches its feverous climax
Then
the long moan and sigh of relief

NICK (VO)
Im just a teenager

And as Frank Sinatras UNTIL THE REAL THING COMES ALONG
begins we go to OPENING CREDITS

YOUTH IN REVOLT
INT ESTELLES KITCHEN - DAY

Nick regards Jerry from across the dining room table There
is the off-screen sound of a cretin slurping Cheerios
Reveal Jerry reading Sports Illustrated scratching his
balls

with one hand and shoveling in cereal with the other
Estelle

is washing dishes when she spies something out the window

ESTELLE
Jerry Where did that car come
from
Jerry looks over his shoulder and they all take a moment to
appreciate the slab-sided Lincoln in the drive

JERRY
Its a 62 Lincoln convertible
Like the one Kennedy was shot in

NICK
Except his was black and yours is
white And dirty

JERRY
See that I was going to take you
and your mom for a spin after
breakfast But now I guess itll
just be her and me You have your
smart mouth to thank for that

NICK
Damn it I guess Ill just have to
hang out all alone at the book
depository

JERRY
The what

ESTELLE
Jerry I dont understand What
happened to the Chevy-Nova

JERRY

Sold it to a sailor on the Alameda

Naval Air Base A man should never

own a car for more than three

months Estelle That way he always

gets the thrill of owning a new

automobile
Jerry smiles with cretin pride Nick looks to his mother and
disturbingly enough she seems turned on by his car-owner
savvy
EXT ESTELLES HOME - DAY

Nick stands in the doorway watching as his mother waits for
Jerry to open the passenger door for her

NICK (VO)

After spending twelve years with

Dad Mom has had a string of

lovers none of whom she has asked

me to approve
Jerry fails to notice Estelle waiting and instead just

climbs

in and chugs his beer Estelle appears mildly disappointed
before opening the door herself

NICK (VO)
Im starting to think her
boyfriends are like US
Presidents
As Jerry pulls out he tosses his beer bottle in the
direction of the trash can at the end of the drive

NICK (VO)
Just when you think they cant get
any worse
He misses and the bottle shatters on the pavement but Jerry
drives off anyway

NICK (VO)
she manages to find Gods
Perfect Asshole

INT ESTELLES HOME - DAY

ON A TV SCREEN

Nick cycles through TiVo and finds the late night SEX
DOCUMENTARY he recorded

INT ESTELLES KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

From the living room comes the sound of an orgy and the

jingle jangle of a belt buckle

Then the DING-DONG of the front doorbell

The jingle jangle pauses and when the doorbell rings a
second

time the orgy gets muted
he

Nick enters the kitchen pulling up his trousers

IE ESTELLES HOME - MOMENTS LATER
The door is opened to reveal two burly tattooed SAILORS
standing on the stoop

Their eyes drift to Nicks mid-section
Nick follows their eyes to the belt buckle he neglected to
fasten out of haste He returns his gaze to the sailors as

wrangles the belt

SAILOR 1
Is Jerry here

NICK
He just left Whats up

SAILOR 1
Whats up is that hunk of shit
Chevy he sold us made it seventeen
miles before the engine blew up

SAILOR 2

And we found evidence of a banana

in the transmission
The second sailor holds aloft the banana peel sealed ina
plastic bag Nick glances to drive and regards the smoking
Chevy-Nova with its camouflage paint job
A THIRD SAILOR is rummaging through the boxes in the open
garage He finds some spray-paint and shakes the can
Nick turns back to the sailors on the stoop

SAILOR 1
So he owes us nine hundred dollars

NICK
Well I think he used that nine
hundred dollars to buy his Lincoln
Hes giving my mom a joyride in it
now But hell be back this
afternoon so I would come back
then Hes pretty stubborn You
might have to beat it out of him

SAILOR 1
grass

couple

That can be arranged In the

meantime were leaving the piece of

shit in the driveway With a note
Nick looks one more time to the Chevy as the third sailor
finishes painting the hood with the words PAY UP OR DIE

NICK
I like it Very to the point
Well See you guys this

afternoon
The sailors nod somewhat perplexed by this kids demeanor
As they turn to go and Nick closes the door

LEFTY (V0O)
I might have to kill myself

EXT HILLS ABOVE UC CAMPUS - DAY

In the clearing a UC JOCK stands behind his ASIAN
GIRLFRIEND kissing her neck and removing her clothes

NICK (VO)
I hope you have a good reason
Reveal Nick and his friend LEFTY 16 belly down in the

overlooking the clearing Lefty watches the copulating
with a pair of binoculars

LEFTY
My sister said she saw Millie
Filbert holding hands with some
college guy

NICK
I dunno Lefty I think your sister
is just waging psychological
warfare

LEFTY
Well its working What am I gonna
do Nick Im obsessed I think
about Millie so much my balls ache

NICK
Maybe your just not wacking off
enough
As if in response Lefty passes the binoculars off to Nick
and then turns over onto his back and unzips his pants
As Lefty jerks it Nick looks with nonchalance

THROUGH THE BINOCULARS
The couple hump in the grass her legs in the air

LEFTY (0S)
So Ive been taping my pecker to
my right leg at night

NICK (VO)
In case you havent heard Leftys
erect member takes a dramatic turn
midway up the shaft

LEFTY (0S)
Then I look at this issue of Better
Homes and Gardens that has a girl
that looks just like Millie until
it gets good and hard I think its
starting to straighten out

NICK
Why dont you just have your
parents take you to the dick
doctor

LEFTY (0S)
Are you kidding It would kill them
to know that I even get hard-ons

NICK
Still you might want to get it
fixed before asking Millie out

LEFTY (0S)
True What if I shove it up the
wrong hole
Nick gives a dubious glance in Leftys direction

NICK (VO)
Leftys grasp of the female anatomy
is somewhat tenuous he imagines
there are orifices galore down
there

INT ESTELLES KITCHEN - DAY

JERRY
Nick you little shit get down
here
Jerry hollers from the kitchen where Estelle gapes out the
window Nick calmly joins them from upstairs

ESTELLE
Nick do you know anything about
this
She points out the window and they all take in the Chevy and
the sailors oh-so-subtle note on the hood

NICK
Oh yeah Those sailors came by
They want their money back I guess
there was a banana in the
transmission

JERRY
You tell them when I was coming
back

NICK
Now why would I do that
Jerry seeths inwardly at Nicks mock innocence

ESTELLE
What are you going to do Jerry

JERRY
I think Ill go get the Lincoln
washed

ESTELLE

Youre leaving What happens when
the sailor comes back for his nine-
hundred dollars

JERRY

Just tell him he bought the car

with my standard guarantee Thirty

days or thirty feet Whichever

comes first Im in the right
And on cue comes the ring of the doorbell and the
simultaneous pounding of angry Navy fists on the back door
They peer out the window and find the fleet on the front
steps

NICK
Oh look The sailors are here
Jerry first starts to dart one way and then another
searching for a hiding space as he hisses

JERRY
Get rid of them
And then the front door gets kicked open and a mob of

sailors
pour in Jerry flees A HANDHELD CAM chase as he heads for
the back and is cut off by the sailors coming in
Jerry bolts up the stairs
NICK
Jerry where are you going Just
tell them you are in the right
INT ESTELLES HOME - CONTINUOUS
They manage to grab Jerry by the legs and haul him down the
stairs Jerry loses his grasp step by step crying with a
sound not unlike ET when the flashlight hit him in the
cornfield
The two big guys with bad haircuts hold Jerry off the ground
while the earnstwhile Chevy owner goes through his pockets

SAILOR 1
Sixty-three lousy dollars

JERRY
Thats my life savings
One of the sailors pokes Jerry in the gut hard and he
whimpers

ESTELLE
Dont hurt him Nick call 911

SAILOR 1
Touch that phone kid and you lose
your left nut
Nick raises his hands You dont have to tell me twice

JERRY
Please Please dont hurt me Its
all I got guys I swear Take the
Lincoln

SAILOR 1
I dont want the Lincoln I want my
nine-hundred dollars Im taking
the sixty-three which means you
owe me another eight hundred and

thirty

NICK
Eight hundred and thirty seven
actually

SAILOR 1

Exactly Have it by tomorrow or

youll be found in the trunk of

your new used piece of shit at the

bottom of the Bay
And with that they release him and Jerry crumples to the
floor like an abandoned marionette

INT ESTELLES KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

The three of them watch the fleet pile into a Navy van that
reads FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY The moment they pull out Jerry
dusts himself off and puts on a pretense of being unfazed

JERRY
Wow those guys are even dumber
than I thought They actually think
Im stupid enough to let them
muscle me into paying

Nicks

ESTELLE
Jerry what are you talking about
We need to call the police

JERRY
Im not some tattle-tale like your
son
Nick rolls his eyes
ESTELLE

Then for Gods sake Jerry just
sell the Lincoln and pay them

JERRY
Cant Its in The Code

ESTELLE
What code The vehicular code

JERRY
Code of the streets Babe Code of
the streets

ESTELLE
Then what are you planning to do
Jerry takes a seat at the kitchen table and adopts The
Thinker pose He strokes his chin as Nick and Estelle await
his brilliant solution with breathless anticipation

IE LINCOLN - DAY

NICK (VO)
We are going to Ukiah for a last
minute vacation
Jerrys got on a hat made from Coors beer cans Hes behind
the wheel of his Lincoln convertible

NICK (VO)
Jerry says well be staying in a
cabin on Clear Lake thats owned by
a friend of his
Estelle dumps in the cooking gear and closes the trunk Her
halter top looks like an advertisement for Droop City

in the back Estelle waves at the neighbors like shes Miss
Corn Dog of 1954

ESTELLE
Goodbye everyone Were going on

vacation

JERRY
Lets blow

She hops up front with Jerry He fires up the Lincoln and
the
radio roars to life with HILLBILLY MUSIC

NICK (VO)

Im not sure how this is the

solution to his problem But Ive

decided to go along with it seeing

as Im not rooting for him anyway
As they pull out Jerry tosses his beer bottle at the

garbage

can at the end of the drive and it once again misses and
shatters on the street behind them

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY

The Lincoln makes its way upstate and dips into the mist
covered hills of Ukiah

EXT RESTLESS AXLES TRAILER PARK - DAY
Theyve pulled to a stop Estelle stares in horror

ESTELLE
Jerry You said it was a cabin
In the back Nick removes his sunglasses to regard the long
green turd of a trailer Some concrete dwarves in the
grass
A dusty canvas awning over a small cement patio A decrepit
picket fence with a sign that reads MY GREEN HAVEN
Estelle looks as if shes about to cry Jerry puts his arm
around her

JERRY
Cmon Estelle Its real cute on
the inside

INT MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT

Substitute cluttered for cute The three of them are crammed
around a dining surface as accommodating as an airplane tray
table 3-D religious art hangs on the wall above them

JERRY
I say the kid does the dishes and
back

we retire to the master bedroom
Jerry pushes out and disappears into the back Nick watches
him with loathing Estelle smiles apologetically

NICK
Mom Do you really like Jerry
Her smile fades

ESTELLE
Nick how many men do you think
there are whod be interested in a
forty-one year old woman with two
brats no money and stretch marks
And with that she excuses herself leaving Nick to ponder

NICK (VO)
Mom is a realist about everything
Except her age Shes forty-three

INT MY GREEN HAVEN - LATER

Nick washes dishes in the toilet-like sink The trailer
shakes from the two adults flogging the mattress in the

EXT RESTLESS AXLES TRAILER PARK - DAY

An old crone MRS SAUNDERS makes her way up the walk She
gets to the door of My Green Haven and bangs on the screen

INT MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY

Nick sleeps on a pull out cot He bolts upright at the
banging his hair going in all directions

MRS SAUNDERS (0S)

Its your neighbor Mrs Saunders

Church services begin at seven

fifteen prompt Donuts will be

served
Nick glances down at the morning wood elevating his boxers
Mrs Saunders narrows her eyes at Nick through the screen
door and takes off

EXT MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY
stop

and

Nick steps out of the trailer in a bathrobe toiletries in
one hand towel in the other He heads off down the wooded
path

EXT WOODS - DAY

The serene melodies of rousing HYMNS float from the well-
attended congregation in the meeting hall

WE TRACK across the trees as Nick makes his way down the
path He slows to observe the sun coming through the canopy
overhead He glances off the path and comes to a sudden

A grape arbor flanked by Corinthian columns set against the
blue of Clear Lake A chestnut haired SHEENI SAUNDERS stands
facing the water her head tilted down to read the book in
her hands The wind coming off the lake blows her dress just
enough to give a hint of the shapely thighs underneath

Light falls in shafts through the latticework of the arbor
like something out of a Frangois Boucher painting

NICK (VO)
The moment I see her I know the
Gods while having cruelly endowed
me with imperfect posture and pussy
postponing pimples had put me here
for a purpose My heart palpitates
My mind races I get an instant

TE
Super (Thundering Erection)
Sheeni glances up from her book and looks over her shoulder
at him Nick just stares She gives an amused smile almost
flirtatious Nick grins back

SHEENI
Your robe is open
Nick looks down He pulls the robe closed scowls and goes
into a flustered march down the path

INT PUBLIC REST ROOM - DAY
An austere cement shed with three dripping shower heads

no privacy walls Nick lathers up under the spray Jerry
appears in the foreground and removes his robe He goes to
out

the shower head next to Nick and turns it on

Nick reacts to Jerry and hastily tries to resume rinsing
himself off Jerry gurgles water and spits He starts
warbling rock lyrics

EXT MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY

Nick comes up the path and stops short at the picket fence
Estelle and Sheeni squat on the patio steps

SHEENI
Hel-lo Excitable Boy

ESTELLE
Nick honey meet Sheeni Saunders

NICK
Hello

ESTELLE
Sheeni needs to go to the grocery
store Ive offered her your help
in carrying her bags
Nick regards Sheeni and her mischievous smirk

NICK
Thanks a pantsful

EXT RESTLESS AXLES TRAILER PARK - DAY

A dusty road Nick totes a watermelon and a paper bag He
watches as Sheeni works on a Popsicle Full lips that cry

to be kissed

NICK
You dont have to go to services

SHEENI
No Much to the consternation of my
fanatical parents I have converted
to atheism Fortunately my brother
Paul paved the way for such
transgressions

NICK
in

As they pass the meeting hall there comes a surge of HYMNS

chorus

Paul is an atheist too

SHEENI
Buddhist I believe though we have
not seen him in some time I myself
am looking forward to being free of
parental bondage

NICK
Likewise

SHEENI
Well your mother seems very nice
though your father I think might be
rather dim

NICK
Jerry and I share no blood links of
any kind

NICK
Sounds rather zealous

SHEENI
Yes even though I am no longer a
believer I always found the
services wonderfully aerobic

NICK
You could say the same thing about
sex

Sheeni stops She looks at Nick intently

SHEENI
Nick are you going to turn out
like all the other young men and
have nothing on your mind except
carnal pleasures

NICK
I hardly ever think about sex
SHEENI
Really I think about it all the
time Its the hormones at work
you know
She resumes walking Nick follows her with confusion

EXT SAUNDERS MOBILE HOME - DAY
They regard the two story Pacemaker mobile home

NICK
Wow A second floor

SHEENI
Yes Father bought it so that he
could look down upon the world For
him Christian humility has always
been a struggle
Sheeni relieves him of the watermelon

SHEENI
Well it was nice to meet you
Nick
She trudges down the slate path to the home

NICK
Sheeni Do you want to come to the
beach with me
She turns around Gives a little smirk

SHEENI
What a thoughtful invitation Id
love to Nick Wait for me in the
living room

INT SAUNDERS MOBILE HOME - DAY

A lot more space than My Green Haven Dark paneling and
somewhat more tasteful religious art

SHEENI
Back in a moment

Nick watches her bound up the stairs

He wanders into the musty living area Moves down the mantel
examining the trinkets Stops to regard the reproduction of
Massaccios Expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden on the wall
of

blanket

He scrutinizes the image his eyes falling to the privates
Adam and Eve

MR SAUNDERS (0S)
I understand you have invited my
daughter to the beach
Nick spins around to see MR SAUNDERS reclining in his
armchair He is an immense florid-faced verdant eye-browed
ogre in a rumpled blue suit

NICK
Er yes Mr Saunders

MR SAUNDERS
Aha Then I trust sir you are
aware that in doing so you have
entered into an oral contract to
perform in loco parentis ie to
provide for the safety and well-
being of aforementioned minor
female

SHEENI (0S)
Oh Father do shut up
Sheeni descends the stairs Jean cut-offs over a knockout
yellow swimsuit that shows off her flowing nubility
Mr Saunders grumbles Sheeni grabs up a straw beach bag and
pushes Nick out the door

SHEENI
Lets go Nick Bye Father

MR SAUNDERS
Vaya con Dios

EXT BEACH - DAY
Sheeni and Nick lay on their backs on the blue beach

reading their respective books Nick watches her turning
pages and making notes in the margins She hands him her
tanning lotion

SHEENI
Would you mind applying this to my
exposed areas

NICK
Not at all

She rolls over onto her stomach exposing her exquisite

back
Nick straddles her hands shaking as he smooths sweet oils
into her tanned flesh
Flashing super Thundering Erection
SHEENI
My you get turned on easily
Nicks hands freeze
SHEENI
Oh dont stop Nick We all have
our hormones to deal with Girls
are fortunate in that it doesnt
show For all the world knows my
vagina could be moist with desire
as we speak
NICK
Is it
SHEENI
Thats none of your business Im
sure Shall you do my front too
NICK
Im up for it
She rolls over onto her back her young breasts straining up
against the yellow spandex
SHEENI
I hope you dont find it too
stimulating Nick
NICK
Im coping
He starts in on her flawless legs gliding on the oil all
the

way within a fingers reach of her sweet apex

With each daring pass he comes closer to that final split
Finally the hand swerves too late and lightly grazes the
softly yielding vee

SHEENI
Uh Nick Maybe you better do the
top now
Nick moves up lubricating her arms shoulders and neck He
smooths the oil on the soft undulating foothills
SHEENI
Thanks Nick

She rolls back onto her stomach with finality and goes back
to her book Nick hovers above her a moment then painfully
returns to his own reading

EXT RESTLESS AXLES TRAILER PARK - DAY

They make their way down the path Nick totes the beach bag

SHEENI
Breathless is one of my favorite
films though it might be eclipsed
by Rebel Without a Cause I often
wonder what American cinema would
be like today had Dean done more
than three
Nick nods and for a beat they trek on in silence He
glances
down at her hand and fumbles for it with his own

SHEENI
Oh Nick You seem very nice But
in fairness I should tell you that
I have a boyfriend
Nick becomes sickeningly pale

NICK
Whats his name

SHEENI
Trent Preston

NICK
Whats he like

SHEENI
Seventeen years of age six-two
fluent in French plays the piano
a champion swimmer and writes
Futurist Percussive poetry
They stop at the gate to the Saunders home

NICK
Im not familiar with Futurist
She takes

She gives
expression

Percussive poems

SHEENI
I could recite one of Trents if
youd like

NICK
Please do
a dramatic pause

SHEENI
RamDam 12 Sizzle mop Crunch down
Safety net Hot Hot Hot Void
a slightly amused smile at Nicks blank

NICK (VO)
If thats poetry Im a turkey
scrotum

INT MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT

TIME LAPSE of Nick thrashing about in bed During this
montage there is the constant ticking of a clock

NICK (VO)
Here is an hour by hour account of
the worst night of my life

Nick flipping through a Penthouse under the covers

NICK (VO)
1 AM I decide it is just a case of
puppy love and look forward to the
interesting women I shall meet in
the future

EXT MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT

A light comes on in the window

INT MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY

Nick at the dining table writing a note

NICK (VO)
2 AM I conclude the only way out
is suicide I begin to pena
poignant suicide note Sheeni will
see Trent for the shallow pedant he
is and always treasure my memory

JERRY (0S)
Turn off the damn light

EXT MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT
Nick paces about back and forth in the yard

NICK (VO)
3 AM I decide I am too chicken for
any of the manly violent means of
suicide I shall swallow sleeping
pills Where to get them though

INT MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT

Nick is in bed jerking off The trailer shakes despite his
best efforts

NICK (VO)
4 AM I can not die an inviolate
virgin Either I find a way to get
laid soon or suicide gets postponed
until after high school

JERRY (0S)
You wanna beat your meat go
outside

INT PUBLIC REST ROOM - DAY
Nick in the shower going to town on his TE
NICK (VO)
5 AM It will be too painful to see
Sheeni again I shall ask Mom if we

can cut our vacation short and
return to Oakland

INT MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY

Nick rolls over on the cot and looks up with the gaze of a

manic insomniac

NICK (VO)
6 AM Violent panic I have to see
Sheeni again

INT SAUNDERS MOBILE HOME - DAY

The door opens to reveal Nick standing outside in shorts
IM SINGLE LETS MINGLE shirt and tennis shoes Sheeni
stands in the door Sleep-fogged eyes

NICK
Good morning

SHEENI
Nick God what time is it

NICK
Seven oclock How about breakfast

SHEENI
(smiling with endearment)
Come back in two hours Im going
on a hike You can join me if youd
like
She closes the door

Super One hour fifty seven minutes later
A knock on the door Sheeni opens it to reveal Nick
dressed the same Sheeni wears Khakis red bandanna

an

neckerchief and an Australian bush hat She looks like the

worlds most desirable Girl Scout She examines Nicks
attire

SHEENI
Nick where are your hiking boots
water bottle provisions survey
maps and compass

NICK
Like John Muir I enter the
wilderness with nothing more than
my journal and a childlike sense of
wonder

SHEENI
Okay but I have no plans to baby
any slackers

EXT WOODS - DAY

Sheeni leads the way up hill Nick clutches his cramped
stomach with one hand his journal in the other

He watches the rhythmic movements of her ass through her
hiking shorts

EXT BLUFF OVER CLEAR LAKE - DAY

Nick and Sheeni peer over the edge of the cliff The waters
of Clear Lake churn below

NICK
Quite a drop

SHEENI
Yes Not to be morbid but this
sight has been the chosen means of
at least three teen suicides

NICK
Huh Quite a hike just to end your
life

SHEENI

Well there is a road But I agree
Adolescents have a tendency toward
the over-dramatic

Sheeni backs away Nick stays staring over the edge

EXT WOODS - DAY

Nicks eyes roll back as he relieves himself against a tree
He shakes off the last of it and zips up

EXT BLUFF OVER CLEAR LAKE - LATER
He emerges from the woods only to find Sheeni reading his

journal She looks up at his and smiles The brazen sneak
isnt even embarrassed

NICK
Thats my journal

SHEENI
Dont get so upset Nick Though
your handwriting is egregious you
have a fairly decent vocabulary
Although Trent is not an affected
twit
Nick snatches the journal out of her hands

NICK
Those are my private thoughts and
are none of your business

SHEENI
Nick

NICK
What

SHEENI

The lengths you say you are willing

to go to to win my heart the

contemplation of suicide at the

thought of not having me

(taking a sensual breath)

It all evokes a strong emotional

warmth in my breast
Nick can only stare at her sprawled out on her back as if
posing for a centerfold

SHEENI
Did you mean it Nickie
A beat as he is lost in the ocean of her gaze before he
manages to gain his senses

NICK

SHEENI
A necessity for a child ina
household with prying Christian
parents

NICK
What does it say

SHEENI
Wouldnt you like to know That

interest to you
Nick leaps on top of her grabbing her thin wrists She
squeals and giggles

NICK
Spill it I demand full disclosure

SHEENI
Never

They wrestle perspiring squirming bodies brushing

Flashing super Thundering Erection

They pause Hes got her arms pinned Shes on her back

hovers above her

SHEENI
(softly chanting)
Nickies got a hard-on
Nick considers her expression

SHEENI
Youre still a virgin I can tell
Maybe thats why I like you

A beat She looks at him expectantly Nick is at a loss

SHEENI
Kiss me you wienie

He

Nick tentatively approaches her luscious mouth Their noses

dodge successfully and their lips meet

After a long moment they break it off Staring into each

others eyes Sheeni jumps up
SHEENI
Okay lover Breaks over Lets

Nick lays in the grass a moment watching after her
EXT SAUNDERS MOBILE HOME - DAY

Nick walks Sheeni to the gate She turns around to face him

NICK
When can I see you again

SHEENI
Get up early tomorrow and you can

Five minutes to six If you dare
Nick grins with excitement

INT MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHT
Nick dines at the tray table with Jerry and Estelle

ESTELLE

JERRY
Shes got a nice rack

ESTELLE

Jerry chuckles Nick stares at him perhaps resolving to
murder the trucker in his sleep

INT MY GREEN HAVEN - LATER

Nick lies below us on the cot unable to sleep with the
anticipation of the imminent loss of his virginity

EXT MY GREEN HAVEN - NIGHTDAY

Another perfect California summer dawn a pale moon
lingering

in the blue morning sky Nick emerges from My Green Haven in

his robe He starts off down the path

EXT WOODS - DAY

The trailer park is relatively silent save for birds and the

footing

with

reaches

as

distant sound of dogs barking

EXT PUBLIC REST ROOM - DAY

Nick approaches the shower building As he nears the sound
of water running can be heard from the ladies side

INT PUBLIC REST ROOM (WOMENS SIDE) - DAY

The womens side has real stalls and privacy doors Nick
spots the chamber at the end where Sheenis naked form
showers obscured by tacky stained glass

He kicks off his slippers Hangs his robe on a hook

He approaches the stall

Flashing super Thundering Erection

He opens the shower door and steps into the steamy spray
He embraces her Pendulous breasts sagging skin a patch of
white hair under a drooping belly wrinkles Its Mrs
Saunders She looks up startled

Nick lets out a horrible woman-like scream Mrs Saunders
starts screaming too the sound of a pig being slaughtered
She hurls a bar of soap

The bar strikes Nick upside the head and he loses his

on the slippery tile He goes down taking Mrs Saunders
him They wrangle in the mist as Nick tries to escape
MRS SAUNDERS

RAPE RAAAAAPE
Suddenly the door opens Its Sheeni in her robe She

out and pulls Nick up
SHEENI
Get out quick
Still wearing her robe she dives into the spray to save her
mother Nick grabs his robe and retreats
INT CAFE - DAY

Nick slouches in a corner of the shop his hands trembling

he brings his coffee to his lips He hears the door open and
looks up but instead of the cops finds Sheeni She joins

him
at the table
NICK
Should I go to the sheriffs now
SHEENI
No I managed to convince Mother
you were retarded and couldnt read
the sign

Nick nods thankfully

NICK
Say where were you anyway We
said five minutes to six

SHEENI
Im sorry But Nick women are
always discreetly late Its
expected of us

NICK
Swell And the punctual guy fries
in the chair for rape

SHEENI
Dont complain At least you got to
shower with a naked woman
(licking donut powder off
her fingers)
What are your plans today

NICK
My parents want to go to
Middletown Jerry has the moronic
notion of buying a trailer there
before we leave

SHEENI
I should like to come with you
Nick The more time we spend
together the better I fear when
you leave we might never see each
other again
Nick nods glumly Clearly a devastating thought
INT LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY

Sheenis in back with Nick but doesnt seem to mind the
wind

tunnel She has a scarf tied around her chestnut locks

Nick looks down as she casually rests a hand on the inside
of

his thigh

As they round a curve at 60 she yanks Nicks sunglasses off

and tosses them over her shoulder into the lake

EXT GEEZERS MANOR - DAY
Estelle Jerry Nick and a toothless old GEEZER whose gut
rivals Jerrys all stare at a rusty RV that looks like it

might not make the trip back
In the background Sheeni pets a goat in the dusty yard

JERRY
Whats your cash price

GEEZER
I said in the ad Thousand dollars
firm
JERRY
Thousand huh That must be with a
guarantee
GEEZER

As is where she is

JERRY
I dont know Those rusty propane
tanks are a fire hazard The roof
probably needs work I couldnt go
above eight hundred
The geezer ponders the bad news Estelle shakes her head and
goes inside the RV to inspect

ESTELLE (0S)
There are mouse droppings in all
the closets Jerry
squirming

tiny

GEEZER
I might take nine fifty

JERRY
Nine hundred
Sheeni lets out a squeal of delight They all turn their
attention to where she has discovered a box full of

PUPPIES
She brings one of them over

SHEENI
Look Nick
She shows him the ugly little pug Short droopy ears a

batlike face

NICK
Great

SHEENI
(to the geezer)
How much

GEEZER
Ten dollars
Sheeni turns to Nick pleadingly Nick fishes through his
wallet

NICK
All I have is a Subway card with
four stickers

GEEZER
Sold

NICK
No doubt close to the dogs actual
value

SHEENI

Oh thank you Nickie
She plants a kiss on his lips and promptly turns her
attention to the dog who licks her face affectionately
Nick
looks on with appropriate jealousy

SHEENI
Im going to name him Albert
(pronounced Al-bear)

GEEZER
That dont sound like any kind of
name for a dog

SHEENI
(scowling defensively)

Ill have you know Ive named him

after the deceased French writer

Albert Camus Author of LEtranger

and other works of existential

brilliance
The geezer looks to Nick with an expression of I stand
corrected Nick returns with a nod that says You have no
idea

annoyance

SHEENI

(SNIFFLING)
Nick honey Why dont you take
Albert He could be our love child

NICK
No way

SHEENI
At least you could consider it
honey For me Ive never asked you
for anything before

NICK
Maybe I could take him but Id
have certain conditions I would
have to be the only dad on the
scene
(matter of fact)
Trent would have to go

SHEENI
Thats asking a lot Trent worships
the ground I walk on

NICK
Its your choice Life with me and
the dog you love Or a pet-free
existence with a shallow
egotistical poet

Sheeni ponders this

SHEENI
OK Nick I guess I dont have any
choice Ill break up with Trent
But if he kills himself its on
your conscience

NICK
I accept full responsibility

SHEENI
Well good thats settled

NICK
Not quite darling I want one more
thing
SHEENI
What
NICK

What do you think
A beat Sheeni looks pensive It fades to amusement

SHEENI
Do you have a condom
Nick lifts his eyebrows Now were getting somewhere

SHEENI
It has to be in a safe place A
nice comfortable bed With no
threat of interruptions And for
relaxation and mood setting some
good red wine preferably French I
want a new condom Not one thats
been riding around in your wallet
for years Consumers rated them a
while back I suggest you get their
top-rated brand This may take some
research in the library Id
appreciate a photocopy of the
article Plus for supplementary
protection I want a name brand
spermicide

NICK
How about I have a quick vasectomy

Estelle

just to be on the safe side

SHEENI
(matter of fact)
Well Nick that of course is up
to you

Nick looks displeased that his sarcasm didnt register
EXT MY GREEN HAVEN - DAY

Jerry hitches the trailer to the back of the Lincoln
loads up the trunk

ESTELLE

Nick honey say goodbye to Sheeni

Its time to hit the road
Nick watches Sheeni kiss Albert He looks less than enthused
at the thought of sloppy-seconds Finally Sheeni hands Nick
the dog
Nick and Sheeni stand there an awkward beat Sheeni leans in
and gives him a peck on the cheek

SHEENI
(whispering in his ear)
Dont forget darling Red wine and
Consumer Reports
She smiles Theyre the sexiest words Nicks ever heard
He grabs her and kisses her deeply
Jerry HONKS the horn and they break off

INT LINCOLN - DAY

Nick gets into the back seat with Albert The dog whimpers
Sheeni stands off to the side waving at them both

JERRY
Okay Back to civilization
He fires up the Lincoln and they kick up dust Albert
slobbers all over Nick
Nick sets him down and watches Sheeni in the side-mirror
waving in the road

NICK (VO)
I have a tall mountain to climb
with many treacherous glaciers

still to cross but finally I have

obtained a stamped entry visa to

the paradise that lay beyond

prospect for getting laid

JERRY

ESTELLE
How did they ever get it in here

flip through the manual

NICK

Yeah but Im not sure I should try

is for people whove been married

so long theyre disgusted by the

sight of each other
They regard the illustrated figures of men and women in
various states of foreplay

LEFTY
Are we really supposed to be
that uh big

NICK

I think these illustrations are
disproportionate for emphasis

LEFTY
Maybe we should compare

NICK

Perhaps we should Just for the

sake of research
Nick and Lefty get to their feet and stand opposite each
other like a pair of duelists They simultaneously undo

belts and pull their pants and underwear to their feet

They straighten Leftys eyes fall to Nicks crotch He gets
a hint of concern in his expression

Nick stares at Leftys tilting his head to compensate for
the curvature

The door behind them opens and Estelle appears toting Nicks
lunch She lets out a scream The boys turn to face her
pants around their ankles

him upside the head

He loses his balance and goes tumbling down the staircase
letting out a moan that stutters as his head hits each step
He comes crashing into the foyer landing on the slate

INT NICKS ROOM - DAY

Nick hunches over his desk doing homework headphones over

of

his ears Estelle knocks and enters Nick pulls the
headphones down around his neck

ESTELLE
Lance and I are walking down to the
movie theater Theres TV dinners
in the freezer Oh and Nick - your

ESTELLE

NICK

ESTELLE
Watch your smart mouth
She slams the door

EXT ESTELLES HOME - DAY

NICK (VO)
The plan is simple
Nick places two full cannisters of gasoline into the trunk

the Lincoln
Nicks behind the wheel backing up the car

NICK (VO)
Tow Jerrys trailer to a remote
parking lot in Berkeley and burn it
to the ground
The hitch ball grinds under the trailer socket

NICK (VO)
Thus evicting myself from my
He

pear

trailer

mothers clutches and into the arms

of My One And Only Love
Nick fires up the V-8 engine and shifts into drive pulling
forward He cuts across the lawn

NICK (VO)

Francois wanted to torch the

trailer where it sits but Ive

convinced him a parking lot will

reduce the risk of collateral

damage
The trailer clips the corner of the house Chunks of stucco
fall and the galvanized downspout shudders and writhes
collapsing the long rain gutter running across the front of
the home
Nick guns it and with a lurch the trailer splinters free

dodges the birch tree but plows over the smaller Asian

The Lincoln bounces the curb and catapults into the street
the trailer weaving back and forth smashing parked cars

INT LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY

Nick cruises along sedately He plays with the radio and
settles on the Sex Pistols

He looks up just in time to see the red light and slams on
the brakes nearly jack-knifing the trailer

The light turns green and the car lumbers up the long hill

EXT BERKELEY - DAY

Nick hits the bump in the road right before the stop sign
The car bottoms out The trailer bounces up coming
unhitched

IE LINCOLN (MOVING) - DAY

Nick hits the gas and the Lincoln suddenly surges forward
released from the great weight

Nick smiles Behind him through the rear window the

can be seen receding into the distance He glances into the
mirror and spots the trailer plunging down the hill

Then he crashes into the Fiat parked in front of him at the
intersection The gas tank on the Fiat cracks spurting fuel
onto the pavement
scatter

cross

in

run

apart

EXT BERKELEY - DAY

Nick leaps from the Lincoln and watches open-mouthed as the
vehicular ballet unfolds

Down the hill - the speeding trailer sideswipes a delivery
van and goes into a spin The BOHEMIANS sipping espresso at
the outdoor café look up to see the words GODS PERFECT
ASSHOLE bearing down on them

The delivery van veers out of control The Bohemians

The truck runs over a fire hydrant and smashes its way

through the patio furniture and into the café

A geyser of water plumes where the hydrant once stood

The trailer resumes its downward plunge toward the busy

street below
KWOMP Nick turns to see the still-restive Lincoln part from
the Fiat and begin to roll down the hill after its partner

NICK

Oh no I forgot to set the brake

The DRIVER OF THE FIAT bolts after the accelerating Lincoln
but as he realizes the futility slows to a jog
The driver turns to see he forgot to set his own brake and
desperately rolls out of the way of the Fiat
MOTORISTS slam on their brakes as the speeding trailer
crosses four lanes of traffic It jumps the curb crashing
into the plate glass window of a gourmet sausage shop
A cop car lights up and speeds into the intersection just

time to get clipped by the Lincoln
The cop car goes into a tail spin smashing into a chicken
transport The flock of feathered inmates fly for freedom

The Lincoln continues to generate momentum on its slalom

thundering past the stopped cars and into the wrecked
building like a runaway express train

The gas cannisters in the trunk ignite and the sausage shop
explodes the trailers two propane tanks going off like
bombs

The Fiat comes flying into the flaming mess and blasts

sending shards of metal and sausage links to go raining down
on the spectators

The blaze lights the trail of gasoline left by the broken
fuel tank and a stream of liquid fire races up the hill
ending at Nicks feet

Nick takes a moment to watch in horror as dark plumes of
smoke billow into the sky the geyser of water the storm of
dazed chickens He turns around and does his best to
inconspicuously walk OUT OF FRAME

INT ESTELLES KITCHEN - NIGHT

WE FOLLOW Nick as he comes through the front door and is met
with the sight of his mother and Lance staring at him from
the kitchen table

ESTELLE

SHEENI

I assume he went back to the boys

inquiries
Though silence follows we take a moment to allow Nicks

mind

to race in the dark He stands and looks at the mirror above
the dresser Francois can be made out sitting by the window
in the moonlight stroking the Thompson

FRANCOIS
Now is our chance

NICK
Chance for what

FRANCOIS
To confront our nemesis We must go
to the boys dorm and kill Trent
where he sleeps

NICK
I suppose we should at least get a
look at him To see what were
dealing with

FRANCOIS

(stubbing out his

CIGARETTE)
You see what we are dealing with
and zen I wll deal wiz it
And with that he cocks the Thompson for dramatic flare

Nick emerges from the room in nothing but his underwear and

whindbreaker He creeps down the hall

EXT ECOLE DES ARTS ET LITTERATURE - GROUNDS - NIGHT
The school SECURITY VAN crawls by in the background a
searchlight sweeping the grounds

The moment it is out of sight Nick darts from the bushes of
the girls dorm and races across the campus to the boys
dorm

INT BOYS DORM - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Nick makes his way down the hall checking the names on the
colored paper cut-out shapes that adorn the doors

He stops and backtracks when he spots the door that boasts
the names TRENT and ED

Nick knocks on the door

It opens inward to reveal a bare-chested hulking athlete in
a pajama pants This is ED SOLOMON

NICK
Trent

ED
No Who the hell are you

NICK

NICK

NICK

Nothing Its just that Sheeni

guy named Ed and that he touches
the guy when he falls asleep But

Ed Solomon Take care now

Nick takes off running and Ed stares after him

EXT ECOLE DES ARTS ET LITTERATURE - GROUNDS - NIGHT

The security van continues to make its rounds We find Nick
crouching behind the steps to the boys dorm

He pulls the hood of his windbreaker over his head and takes
a deep breath

As the searchlight passes by he makes a break for it

TRACK with Nick as he darts from one form of cover to the
next perhaps accompanied by the imagined sounds of mortar
blasts and machine gun turret fire

At long last he reaches the girls dorm undetected
INT GIRLS DORM - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Nick bangs on the door Heather answers in little more than

G-string and Nick seems to forget his mission just long
enough to appreciate her body

HEATHER
Whats up Nick

NICK

HEATHER
Not anymore

NICK
What happened to Lefty

LEFTY (0S)
Im right here Nick
Nick peers past Heather where he finds Lefty standing naked
in the moonlight

HEATHER
Trent was here but he left He
only dropped by to lend us a couple
more condoms

NICK
But I gave Lefty two already

HEATHER
Yes and that was very generous of
you but the night is young

NICK
So what is Trent the fucking
condom faerie

LEFTY
You can have one of ours Nick If
you need one
The fact that Nick doesnt yet raises his temperament even
further

NICK
So where did he say he was going

HEATHER
He didnt say but Im pretty sure
I just saw him go into our bathroom
down the hall

NICK
Thanks Oh and Id be careful with
those condoms Trents roommate Ed
said that Trent pokes holes in them
so that he can get Sheeni pregnant
and be with her forever
And with that piece of disturbing info he leaves them

INT GIRLS BATHROOM - NIGHT

There is the CLAP of thunder outside as Nick throws open the
door to the girls bathroom He looks around with murderous
rage

There comes the sound of someone vomiting

Nick kicks in the stall and finds BERNICE LYNCH 17 a thin
platinum haired girl with six earrings per lobe She hurls
into the toilet again and turns around to find Nick

his way to Sheenis room
Nicks eyes widen in alarm

INT SHEENIS DORM ROOM - NIGHT

Nick enters the dark room to the sound of the bed squeaking
Vijay and Taggarty grunt away on the top bunk

She blinks waking and smiles at the sight of him

NICK

The door to the room slams open and they are suddenly

by the harsh beam of the matrons flashlight

MATRON

Nick bolts upright smacking his head against the top bunk
He lands on the floor where he gets a view of Trent
standing behind the matron The blinding light makes his
features difficult to make out but his white teeth are
definitely smiling diabolically

EXT GIRLS DORM - NIGHT

The boys come out of the front door of the dormitory the
matron flanked by SCHOOL SECURITY GUARDS hot on their

cheering the boys escape

Vijays pants fall to his ankles tripping him up

Nick and Lefty grab Vijay by the arms and pull him up again
as if he were a wounded war buddy in a retreat from the
Vietnamese Army

They reach the Beamer at the edge of the grounds Nick gets
in first Lefty dives through the back window legs kicking
Vijay slams the door just as the matron and her security

catches up to them The authorities bang on the windows as

tall giant in a plaid shirt and bib overalls He looks down

INT ESTELLES LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Nick and the other two boys pause in the doorway

Where once the Chevy occupied the space the living room was

now fairly returned to its normal uncluttered state with
all

the furniture placed back in the original positions

At some point Wally must have sawed a hole in the wall
shared

by the living and dining areas because the Chevy now
occupies

that hole and has been painted and decorated such that it
has

achieved an almost seamless blend with the wall

Estelle goes and takes a seat on the couch

ESTELLE
Go ahead Wally Show them
Wally blushes before he flips a switch and the tail lights
come on giving the living room a warm flattering glow

NICK LEFTY VIJAY
Oocooooh
Wally flips another switch and the cars radio turns on

Wally makes a slightly embarrassed gesture of scratching his
head before lumbering over to the couch and taking a seat

the

next to Estelle

listen to the Chevy play them Elvis LOVE ME TENDER
The two adults snuggle in the glow of the tail lights and it
brings an unexpected rush of caring in his expression

Nick smiles with amusement
TAGGERTY (0S)
Hello Nick
Taggarty makes her entrance down the stairs cloaked in a
green cape

TAGGERTY
How is the star-crossed persistent
lover
She greets him with a casually intimate kiss

NICK
Okay I guess Wheres Sheeni

TAGGERTY
Upstairs Nick She saw you coming
and hid in her room

INT SHEENIS ROOM - NIGHT

Nick knocks and enters to find Sheeni sprawled on the bed
with a boo

NICK
Dinner is almost ready My Love

SHEENI

I do not intend to be party to my
brothers absurdities He has
allowed you in and drugged my
parents

NICK
I think they are deriving some good
from the experience
Sheeni finally looks up from her book

SHEENI
What are you doing here Nick I
expressly asked you not to come

NICK
To hell with that What do I have
to do to prove my love to you My
friends have gotten laid and Im
pretty sure neither one of them was
beaten with a tree trunk raped by
a walrus or had to contend with
the likes of Trent Preston

SHEENI
You were raped by a walrus

NICK
Sheeni I have shown restraint I
have committed crimes I have
traveled to the lengths of the
state and still you wont give me
this one little thing

SHEENI
Sex Nick Why dont you just say
it Thats what you want You want
me to have sex with you

NICK

(BEAT)
Well YEAH
A beat as Nicks open admissions makes her consider his
point She sighs and shakes her head

SHEENI
How is my dog

NICK
Excellent He should be coming out
of the oven right about now
She tosses the book at him but he dodges it successfully

SHEENI
I hate you Nickie
She stands up and tries to slap him He grabs her wrists and
pulls her to him

NICK
I hate you too
They share a long intense kiss
They break away and she smiles in spite of herself

INT SAUNDERS MOBILE HOME - NIGHT
The Saunders and extended family take their seats at the
polished mahogany table crammed with turkey yams mashed
potatoes and cranberry sauce

They all lower their heads and Lacey leads them in prayer

LACEY
Dear Lord
Mr Saunders emits a long low fog horn of a fart that ends
badly
The others exchange glances but he and his wife still have
their heads solemnly bowed

LACEY
Dear Lord thank you for this
bounty Help us to be tolerant of
others - especially the boyfriends
and girlfriends of our immediate
relations Amen

EVERYONE
Amen

They begin eating A helicopter passes by outside search
light briefly coming through the windows

Nick watches Mr Saunders take a handful of mashed potatoes
and apply it to his face like war paint

MRS SAUNDERS
Paul Your father looks rather
strange

PAUL
Well mother he is sitting in his
own bowel movement

MRS SAUNDERS
Thats no excuse
Another helicopter passes overhead

TAGGARTY
The food is delicious Paul

PAUL
Thank you

(BEAT)
Sister darling how long has it

been since we all observed the
rituals of Thanksgiving

SHEENI
Not long enough Paul

NICK
I hope its the first of many such
occasions for me
Sheeni narrows her eyes at him
A long beat as they all dine in silence Then-
Mrs Saunders croaks out in song

MRS SAUNDERS
Siiiilent night Hooooly night
Aaaall in calm aaall is bright
Paul begins humming approvingly and one by one the others
accompany her as Mr Saunders pretends to conduct them with

drumstick

EVERYONE
Round yon virgin Mother and Child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace Sle-eep
in heavenly pee-eace

And with that the doorbell rings Taggarty gets up and
the door

TAGGARTY
Oh Trent you made it
Nick glances up with a start as TRENT PRESTON makes his
entrance Hes not quite the deity Nicks expected but
rather a fairly plain blond with slightly androgenous
features and a certain flamboyance His black eye courtesy
of Ed Solomon still remains

TRENT
Hello Taggarty Hello Everyone
Mr Saunders grunts his acknowledgement as he takes the
pitcher and pours water into his own lap

SHEENI
Trent darling this is Nick
Trent swivels slowly around and they lock eyes

TRENT
Nick at last we meet

NICK
Hello Trent

TAGGARTY
Have a seat Trent

TRENT
Im sorry Taggarty I cant stay
I have bad news

SHEENI
What is it

TRENT
Bernice Lynch has tried to commit
suicide
Sheeni and Taggarty gasp Nick swallows hard

TRENT
She swallowed a number of sleeping
pills and is now in a coma

SHEENI
The poor girl

TRENT
Theres more Before I left school
I searched her room

NICK
Did you obtain proper authorization
from the officials

TRENT
No Nick I acted on my own
initiative In Bernices closet I
found this letter
He dramatically extracts the letter from his pocket

TRENT
In the letter the writer
direction

instructed Bernice to begin
sedating Sheeni with drugs he
himself supplied

TAGGARTY
Nick you didnt

NICK
Well you see

SHEENI
Nick You could have killed me

MR SAUNDERS
Who died

TRENT
No one yet Mr Saunders

Mrs Saunders points a liver spotted finger in his

MRS SAUNDERS
ARREST HIM

TRENT
I cant arrest him But I have
called the Santa Cruz Police They
are on their way here now
Nick places his napkin next to his plate and stands

NICK
Well I shall be going now Please
continue without me

TRENT
Nick I suggest you remain here and
face the consequences like a man
Nick stops in front of Trent

NICK
Thank you for that unsolicited
counsel Trent And please do drop
dead
The other guests murmur their shock Nick stops in the
doorway

NICK
Goodbye Sheeni I did it all for
you

SHEENI

You are completely contemptible

Nick Twisp I never wish to see you

again
With the dreadful proclamation ringing in his ears Nick
leaves

EXT WOODS - NIGHT
Nicks silhouette figure racing through the trees

Here I am reviled by friends and
family Relentlessly pursued by

Nick stops at the edge of the woods to catch his breath

NICK (VO)
Since my sister can see through me
Im obliged to give a relatively
candid and thorough review of the
events

Joanie listens gravely shaking her head at the most

parts of the story Nick finishes flopping into a chair

Nick furrows his brow

JOANIE
Nick six months ago you were just
another brownnosing honor student
What happened

NICK
Im not really sure I fell in love
with Sheeni All I want is to be
with her The rest is all a big
misunderstanding

JOANIE

Nick youve stolen vandalized
trespassed and burned down
Berkeley All for one girl If
theres a misunderstanding its
with your insight into females

NICK
But But where did I go wrong

JOANIE
Nick boys your age are always
looking for the path of least
resistance to becoming a man A
boys whole self-esteem rests on
how fast he can get a girl into
bed

NICK
So far I agree

JOANIE
Sooner or later what those boys
realize is that the girls youre
chasing base their self-esteem on
how many hoops they can get the boy
to jump through before going to bed
with him

Clearly that had not occurred to him
JOANIE
So I guess what you should ask
yourself is How far are you
willing to go

Nick nods in understanding An epiphanic smile

NICK
All the way Joanie Im willing to
go all the way
Joanie nods in amusement

JOANIE
You can stay here a couple days
but eventually theyll come looking
for you I dont have much money to
give you but here
Nick takes the wad of cash clearly moved

NICK
Thanks Joanie I Uh I love
you

JOANIE

I love you too you little brat

Welcome back Nick We had a
feeling you were coming

INT PAULS HIDEOUT ABOVE GARAGE - LATER

Nick sits beside Paul and Lacey on the couch as they watch
the infamous chicken scene in REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE

NICK (VO)
Paul and Lacey are kind enough to
share some leftover fungi to help
calm my nerves That combined with
yet another viewing of James Deans
performance is what gives me my
final burst of inspiration
They all watch transfixed as JAMES DEAN leaps from his

automobile just in time to escape demise
INT PAULS HIDEOUT ABOVE GARAGE - LATER

As the END CREDITS of REBEL play behind them Lacey fits a
bombshell wig on Nicks head and finishes the last touches

And as the flashers and sirens come to life Nick jumps back
into his fathers car and peels out

The car descends into a nose dive and flips completely

silence to observe the open casket and the SINGLE LETS

Sheeni makes her way toward the line of limos and hearses
She approaches the distant Carlotta

NICKCARLOTTA
A terribly old friend Carlotta

You shouldnt be Carlotta I am no
doubt culpable for Nicks actions

Well love does compel us to
desperate acts People cannot
always act rationally

The greater the love the stronger
the passions the more reckless the

Yes Carlotta Nick had wonderful a
way of making me feel worthy of the

NICKCARLOTTA
My dear if theres one thing the
demise of Nick Twisp has taught me
its that self worth comes from
within
Sheeni gives a pensive nod

SHEENI
Would you like to stay the night
Carlotta We can reminisce of our

brushes in the bathroom

SHEENI

Do you like it I bought it in

Sheeni tugs off the wig and tosses it across the room

NICK

Of course Nick Did you really
expect to fool your soul mate with

of Sheenis lips on his cheek

NICK

SHEENI
Calling Taggarty to report that you
are not completely incompetent in
the bedroom

NICK
Do I get to stay and hear my grade

SHEENI

INT SAUNDERS MOBILE HOME - DAY

Nick prances into the living room in his underwear
He starts to head into the kitchen when he catches sight of
the full length mirror out of the corner of his eye He

in front of the mirror and flexes his biceps Admires
himself

Francois appears in the mirror behind Nick Thompson slung
over his shoulder

NICK
Well good morning Francois What

Nick lowers his arms and furrows his brow

Nick lifts his eyebrows with dawning epiphany
In the reflection we can see behind Nick as Albert leaps

onto

the love seat and barks at the sound of approaching sirens
Nick runs to the window just in time to see half a dozen law
enforcement vehicles pull up

NICK
Sheeni the police are here
He ducks down from the window as a chopper buzzes overhead

Nick looks to Frangois in disbelief But the Frenchman just
rolls his eyes

FRANCOIS
You might as well break it to her
now Nick
A long pensive beat as Nick contemplates telling her he may
never see her again But behind Sheenis air of control

finally sees the vulnerability hes had in his hands all
along

NICK (VO)
Francois is right of course but on
the other hand why be cruel After
all Sheeni had managed to give me
hope every step of the way And if
hope is what Sheeni would now need
to go on well then

NICK
As always you are right my love

Nick turns to face the front while behind him the waving
figure gets ever more distant A pensive moment as he
actually questions

But was it all worth it
Nick revisits those thirty two minutes in his mind and it
brings a smirk to his face
