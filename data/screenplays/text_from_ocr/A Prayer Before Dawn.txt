The Man chokes back tries to hold the toke He burps smoke

AND THE DOOR BANGS OPEN Nindam enters -- Billy spins quick
hides his pipe and foil in a gym bag just in time

Nindam says something in Thai grabs a pair of BOXING GLOVES
and helps Billy put them on

Theres a feeling of urgency that Billy is late

As Nindam ties and tapes the gloves Billy is too highamped
and avoids Nindams gaze

After both nod bump fists

Billy climbs into the ring THROUGH the ropesand waits

Nan looks around the gym at all the BOXERS training He
gestures to one LEK (20s) -- lean tattooed much smaller

Then a HUGE KICK to the jaw -- THAT HITS WITH THE IMPACT OF A
TRUCK -- Billy goes down in a heap

He shakes it off clears his head Other Boxers stop what
theyre doing and watch as Billy picks himself up fire in
his eyesand goes after Lek with a vengeance --

Within moments Lek is throwing and battering Billy like a
rag doll Pounding him at will with solid PUNCHES and KICKS
that knock Billy to the canvas over and over

Billy keeps getting upBut the harder he retaliates the
harder he gets hurt

Nan ringside stoically smokes cigarettes as --

Finally Lek grabs the back of Billys head hauls it down
and launches knee after knee after knee into Billys ribs

Billy goes down hard He slowly gets up Balance wavers Then
he turns and VOMITS over the top rope

Humiliated
Nan nods to Lek who then exits the ring

Billy looks up at all the Boxers talking in Thai joking and
laughing about Billy

He exits the ringNan removes the gloves saying nothing

An assistant trainer TANE approaches with a MOP and
