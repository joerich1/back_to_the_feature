Zippo sparks beneath the foil -- Huge inhale fumes rise and

The Man chokes back tries to hold the toke He burps smoke
spurting from his nostrils

Billy smokes more Yaba Breathes it deep in his lungs

AND THE DOOR BANGS OPEN Nindam enters -- Billy spins quick
hides his pipe and foil in a gym bag just in time

Nindam says something in Thai grabs a pair of BOXING GLOVES
and helps Billy put them on

Theres a feeling of urgency that Billy is late

As Nindam ties and tapes the gloves Billy is too highamped
and avoids Nindams gaze

After both nod bump fists

A MAN sits on a bucket holding a chain with a TINY MONKEY on

the end The monkey wears a plastic doll mask

Two other MEN quickly carry a BLOODIED UNCONSCIOUS FIGHTER on
a stretcher the opposite way

TRUCK -- Billy goes down in a heap

He shakes it off clears his head Other Boxers stop what
theyre doing and watch as Billy picks himself up fire in
his eyesand goes after Lek with a vengeance --

Within moments Lek is throwing and battering Billy like a
rag doll Pounding him at will with solid PUNCHES and KICKS
that knock Billy to the canvas over and over

Billy keeps getting upBut the harder he retaliates the
harder he gets hurt

Nan ringside stoically smokes cigarettes as --

Finally Lek grabs the back of Billys head hauls it down
and launches knee after knee after knee into Billys ribs

Billy goes down hard He slowly gets up Balance wavers Then
he turns and VOMITS over the top rope

Humiliated
Nan nods to Lek who then exits the ring

Billy looks up at all the Boxers talking in Thai joking and
laughing about Billy

He exits the ringNan removes the gloves saying nothing
