FADE IN
INT RITCHIE’S APARTMENTLIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Rain trickles down the window A flash of lightning lights
the room The couch is folded out into a bed A BEAUTIFUL
NAKED BLONDE is stretched out across it asleep
RITCHIE BOLAND late 30’s not the biggest guy around but
rock-solid stands in the small kitchen a few feet away

His face is stuck in a permanent frown

He takes sips of his coffee and admires her from the
counter

The sheets barely cover her moonlit curves

He walks over and tucks her in

EXT DARK ALLEY - NIGHT

It’s pouring rain Ritchie’s car squeezes between the
buildings Its headlights can barely make it through the
downpour

INT RITCHIE’S CAR - TRAVELING

Ritchie drives

SAMMY “TWO-BALLS” late 30’s sits in the passenger seat
His skeletal features draped in shadow

SAMMY
Look at this shit What we do

for money eh Ritchie

Ritchies eyes go to the rearview mirror

EXT DARK ALLEY

They stop
INT RITCHIE’S CAR
Ritchie kills the engine Sammy looks out at the rain

SAMMY
Check it out

EXT DARK ALLEY

Ritchie gets out The rain is relentless He’s soaked
instantly

The lightning helps him inspect his surroundings The
buildings have their backs to him He looks up at the fire
escapes nothing

INT RITCHIE’S CAR

Ritchie drops into his seat He shakes off the cold rain
Some of it lands on Sammy

SAMMY
Jesus

RITCHIE
Sorry Sammy

Sammy pats the drops away Ritchie blows into his freezing
hands and buries them into his wet pockets

SAMMY
This motherfucker better be on
time We’re gonna drown out
here

EXT DARK ALLEY

The rain pummels the car

INT RITCHIE’S CAR

Water streams down the windows as they wait Ritchie shakes
to keep warm his hands still in his pockets Sammy stares
into the dark storm
SAMMY
The vultures are circling
Ritchie

Ritchie looks at him

SAMMY
Some asshole cop is trying to
push me into a corner

He turns to Ritchie

SAMMY
Heard he’s tossing deals to my
people waiting for a bite

Ritchie doesn’t break eye contact THUNDER breaks the
silence

SAMMY
Did he talk to you

RITCHIE

SAMMY
No

Sammy’s hand comes up from his side holding a gun

SAMMY
Should I ask again

RITCHIE
Youll get the same answer

Sammy studies Ritchie’s face

SAMMY
If I find out you so much as
waved to that prick Ritchie
I’m gonna turn your pretty
little blonde girlfriend into a
redhead I swear to God

Ritchie’s eyes turn cold
SAMMY
And you I’m gonna hang you by a
power line like an old pair of
sneakers I’ve done worse for
less

Ritchie is a statue

SAMMY
You think I’m scared of you
(long uncomfortable
beat)
Look me in the eye Ritchie
Look me in the eye and tell me
youre not --

BANG BANG BANG BANG Smoke and broken glass everywhere
Sammy crashes back into his seat The rain comes through
the broken window and washes over him His eyes still
locked on Ritchie

The nose of Ritchie’s 45 sticks out of a smoking hole in
his jacket

EXT DARK ALLEY

Ritchie drags Sammy’s body out into the rain He hurries
back to his car and drives away LIGHTNING Sammy’s
dead eyes stare up at the darkness THUNDER

INT HOSPITALWAITING ROOM - NIGHT

Ritchie wakes up in a hard chair and a cold sweat He
straightens himself out

The JANITOR is mopping the floor near the coffee machine
A NURSE approaches Ritchie gets to his feet

RITCHIE
Still fighting

NURSE
(smiles)
Yes still fighting
RITCHIE
Good

NURSE
Would you like to see him

He takes a long look down the hall

EXT DOWNTOWN STREETRITCHIE’S CAR - NIGHT

Ritchie’s arm hangs out the window A cigarette smolders
between his fingers

He throws a glance at the empty passenger seat THE WINDOW
Is INTACT

He looks out at the convenience store across the street

INT CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

Ritchie winces at the bright fluorescents as he enters
The CLERK watches him as he makes his way to the fridges
He pulls the door open and grabs a large can of beer

He drops the giant can on the counter and reaches into his
pockets

RITCHIE
Smokes cheap ones

Ritchie spots a cute teddy bear on display nearby He grabs
it
RITCHIE
This too

The clerk slides the pack of smokes across the counter and
punches up the total Ritchie pulls out a few crumpled
bills

CLERK
Thirteen fifty
Ritchie counts the wrinkled paper in his hands He reaches
into his pockets for some more nothing He looks up at
the clerk’s expressionless face

EXT CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

Ritchie walks out with only the smokes in his hands He
tosses the wrapper away and tucks the pack into his jacket

He looks up at the building right next to the store

He heads for the entrance

INT APARTMENT BUILDINGHALLWAY - NIGHT

Faded wallpaper lines the hall Ritchie approaches the door
at the end of it

He brings his ear to the flaking wood He hears GIGGLING
coming from inside

He knocks

INT TOMMY’S APARTMENT
The place is a mess
TOMMY a strung-out junky leaves his equally strung-out
GIRLFRIEND on the couch and heads for the door He trips on
a few obstacles on his way there
She takes a hit off her pipe
He looks through the peephole
TOMMY
Shit

HALLWAY

RITCHIE
Open the door Tommy
APARTMENT
GIRLFRIEND
(exhaling)
Who is it baby

Tommy motions to her to keep quiet

HALLWAY
RITCHIE
Open up or it’s coming down
APARTMENT
GIRLFRIEND
(whispering)

Who the fuck is it
Tommy puts his finger to his lips to shut her up

TOMMY
(to the door)
Okay Okay Hold on

He points to the coffee table It’s covered in dirty
dishes beer bottles napkins She tries to figure out
what he’s pointing at and then realizes it’s the knife
resting on the half-eaten pizza

She rushes the knife over to him and disappears into the
bedroom

Tommy holds the knife behind his sweaty back He turns the
deadbolt

Ritchie walks in and takes in the scene

RITCHIE
Where’s the girl

GIRLFRIEND (0S)
I’m calling the fucking cops

Ritchie throws Tommy a heavy look
TOMMY
Get out here baby

She emerges from the bedroom tweaking and shaking

RITCHIE
Do you know why I’m here

They decide to try their luck

TOMMY
No

Ritchie takes a deep breath and looks them both over

HE RAMS HIS HEAD INTO TOMMY’S NOSE and sends him crashing
to the floor like a sack of shit

The knife flies across the room The girl rushes to it She
picks it up and points it at Ritchie

Tommy thrashes around on the floor clutching his bleeding
face

RITCHIE
(to Tommy)

Where is it

GIRLFRIEND
Leave us alone

Ritchie makes his way to the girl

The tip of the blade scrapes the lapels of his leather
jacket He studies her ragged features

Tears run down her cheeks
IN A FLASH his hand sweeps in and grabs her wrist

She puts up a pretty good fight before letting the knife
drop He kicks it away She’s really shaking now

RITCHIE
Sit down

She drops into the couch defeated

He notices some cash on the table He grabs it
He makes his way back to Tommy

Blood pours from Tommy’s nose He tries to wipe it from his
mouth and eyes but it’s everywhere

Ritchie looks through Tommy’s pockets but comes up short
He gives the girl a look before turning Tommy over onto his
belly

Ritchie drops his knee onto the back of Tommy’s neck and
pins him to the floor

RITCHIE
I’m not asking again Tommy

With one hand on Tommy’s wrist the other grabs hold of his
elbow Ritchie puts on the pressure

TOMMY
The bowl It’s in the fucking
bowl

Ritchie looks up at the girl She jumps to her feet and
scurries to the bathroom

Ritchie watches her as she lifts the lid off the tank and
pulls out a baggy with little vials in it

She hurries back and tosses it at him

RITCHIE
Is that all of it

Tommy is face down in a puddle of blood and spit

TOMMY
Yeah That’s all of it Now get
off me

Ritchie looks up at the girl She stands in anticipation
He looks back down at the mess on the floor and without
further hesitation HE PULLS TOMMY’S ELBOW BACK WITH A
VIOLENT JERK and dislocates the guy’s shoulder

Tommy screams and flops around on the floor His arm
dangles from its socket His girlfriend rushes to him in

horror as he thrashes hysterically

Ritchie picks up the baggy and walks out

INT CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

Ritchie enters The clerk greets him with no expression
Ritchie grabs the teddy bear from the display slaps the
money he swiped on the counter and splits

EXT RITCHIE’S APARTMENT BUILDINGSIDEWALK - NIGHT

The street is packed with crumbling buildings and parked
cars POLICE SIRENS fade in the distance

Ritchie stands in the cool night He takes smoke from his
cigarette deep into his lungs

Approaching headlights blast his features

A car stops in front of him

He flicks his cigarette into the darkness

The window rolls down to reveal

NIKKI JERGENS late 20’s a little rough around the edges
but hot as hell Her smile shines through her long dark
bangs

INT NIKKI’S CAR

Ritchie drops into the passenger seat

Nikki reaches up and turns on the light He reaches up and
turns it off

He fingers his inside pocket and produces the baggy with
the vials He hands it off to her and she slaps a small
stack of bills into his waiting hand

Nikki unscrews one of the vials and spills a little bit of
its contents onto her wrist She snorts it back fast and
hard while Ritchie counts his money

NIKKI
Shit

She shuts her eyes tight and rubs her nose

RITCHIE
Take it easy

He gets back out into the cool night

NIKKI
What are you doing for lunch

He continues on his way She watches him for a beat before
taking another hit of the white powder

INT RITCHIE’S APARTMENT BUILDINGHALLWAY - NIGHT

Ritchie notices someone standing by his door

MIKE MOONY early 60’s decked out in a stained wife-beater
and shorts greets Ritchie with a fake smile

RITCHIE
Mike

MIKE
You’re a hard guy to catch Your
schedule’s all over the place

Ritchie unlocks the door

Mike loses the smile and gets in closer

MIKE
Three months you owe me
Ritchie I need at least one

or you’re out on your ass
Ritchie stares him down Mike backs away
He reaches into his pocket and pulls out his new wad He
takes the top twenty from the bundle and slaps the rest

into Mike’s sweaty palm

Mike smiles at the size of it Giant yellow teeth take up
most of his face

MIKE
Was that so hard

Ritchie leaves him in the hall

INT RITCHIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ritchie tosses his keys onto the short kitchen counter by
the door

A lamp lights up the place The teddy bear sits up against
a pillow on the folded out couch

A few frames on a nearby table show PICTURES OF HIM AND
THAT BEAUTIFUL BLONDE FROZEN IN GOOD TIMES

He throws his jacket across the room It lands on an
already full chair next to a WOODEN CRIB

He drops onto the bed picks up the bear and gives it a
little squeeze

INT RITCHIE’S CAR - DAY - TRAVELING

Ritchie drives in silence Large expensive houses pass him
by

EXT BOBBY GOLDEN’S HOUSE - DAY

Ritchie pulls up to the sprawling estate

He’s already smoking as he gets out of his car

CHUCK a mountain of black muscle greets him at the front
door

CHUCK
Man put that out

Ritchie takes one last drag and flicks it away

CHUCK
Nigga did I tell you to toss
that shit onto my boy’s lawn

Ritchie thinks about it
He reluctantly makes his way across the lawn

He reaches down picks up the butt and holds it up to
satisfy Chuck

CHUCK

Kleenex and put it in your
pocket

Ritchie enters the house
CHUCK
I better not find it floating in
one of the toilets again

EXT BOBBY GOLDEN’S HOUSEPOOLSIDE

Ritchie steps through the patio doors and into a backyard
oasis He shoves the cigarette butt into a nearby plant

A MAN is doing laps in the pool

TALIA early 20’s brown and glistening barely covered in
a white bikini is laying flat on her belly taking in the
sun

Her mirrored sunglasses catch his reflection as he
approaches

He waves his hand in front of her face to no reaction
He gives her the finger

TALIA
(smiles)
That’s not nice

RITCHIE
What lap is he on

TALIA
I stopped counting

Ritchie takes a seat on the deck chair beside her

TALIA
Can you put some lotion on my
back

RITCHIE
I don’t want to get my hands
dirty

TALIA

That’s too bad

BOBBY GOLDEN pulls himself out of the pool He’s pushing
50 but not going quietly His fat gold chain glows against
his dark skin He pulls on a robe

He joins them with a huge smile

BOBBY
Ritchie

Ritchie stands up and goes in for the wet hug

BOBBY

He tosses it to Ritchie

BOBBY

Ritchie examines the box A buxom beauty graces the cover -
giant tits pushing out of a prison jumpsuit - “The Hard

INT DINER - DAY
The place tries hard to look like an old-fashioned diner
but in the bright daylight it just looks old A few
customers are enjoying their lunches as Ritchie walks in

He eyes the booths and spots Nikki

He joins her

A car SCREECHES across the lot and brakes hard into a spot

GWEN DUROVA

Ritchie watches her Her movements are quick and erratic

late 20’s platinum blonde and leggy
out of the driver’s side and rushes into the diner

her

Nikki grabs her hands

NIKKI

Gwen throws her a shaky nod
NIKKI

but looks more and more out of place

RITCHIE
I can’t help her

NIKKI

RITCHIE

poor bastard in cold blood

NIKKI

NIKKI
Some accountant or something

NIKKI
Okay

She throws open the door and jumps out

RITCHIE
Walk away from this Nikki It’s

Calm her down We’1ll find
another way

Her smile slowly creeps back

NIKKI
I’1l see what she says

He watches her She makes her way inside and back to the
booth

Gwen listens to every word Nikki’s lips stop moving

Gwen mouths something to her Nikki turns to the window and
slowly shakes her head

RITCHIE
Shit

He starts the car up fast and peels out even faster

back to Trent

RITCHIE
I’m leaving here with a fistful
of your money or a fistful of
your teeth I’1l give you a
minute to decide which one you’d
like to part with today

Trent’s face goes cold
He casually reaches into his drawer He pulls out a gun
He lays it on the desk

TRENT
You know what that is It’s
goodbye

The two men are in a standoff

Ritchie glances between the piece on the desk and Trent’s
smug face

A VIOLENT KICK TO THE DESK sends the whole fucking thing
flying into Trent’s ribs He’s thrown backwards onto the
floor

Ritchie leaps over the desk and lands hard on top of him
Trent gasps for air under the weight

His collar disappears into Ritchie’s clenching fists as
he’s lifted off the floor Trent tries to bat Ritchie’s
hands away but they don’t budge His shirt starts to choke
him out

PETE (0S)
Let him go

Ritchie loosens his grip Trent drops to the floor

PETE SOMMERSED early 50’s a gorilla dressed like a man
hogs the doorway

Ritchie gets to his feet Trent crawls away

RITCHIE

Trent makes it to the couch Pete crosses the scene
TRENT
I think the fucker broke a rib

Pete picks up Trent’s gun from the floor and examines it

RITCHIE
It’s a prop

detective badge hangs off his belt

PETE
This one isn’t

Ritchie

RITCHIE

Pete finds that funny

PETE
Debt You’re never done owing

A BUZZING comes from Ritchie’s jacket He pulls his phone
out just enough “Nikki cell” flashes on the screen He
quickly presses a button and silences it

RITCHIE

the tussle

TRENT
It’s in whatever’s left of my
desk

Pete struggles with the drawer He opens it and pulls out a
fat envelope He tosses it to Ritchie

PETE

Nikki sits beside her on the couch Her arm is stretched
across her lap her hand buried between Gwen’s legs

Gwen’s panties are stretched across her thighs Her skirt
conceals what’s happening underneath

Gwen leans back exhausted

Nikki wipes her hand on the couch and takes care of a line
of cocaine waiting for her on the glass coffee table

The living room is gigantic Paintings sculptures very
classy

Nikki looks over at Gwen and sees that she’s sobbing

of shoeboxes She grabs the one she wants

She approaches Nikki Their noses are red their eyes
watery and alive

Gwen hands her the box Nikki holds it as Gwen lifts the
lid She reaches in and pulls out a revolver

GWEN
Look It’s all here See

Nikki’s eyes try to focus

NIKKI
Holy shit

She knocks the box away and places the gun in Nikki’s still
outstretched hands She forces Nikki’s fingers around the
cold metal Gwen gets in real close

Nikki struggles with the situation She says nothing She
sees the desperation in Gwen’s eyes Her hands are closed
firmly on top of hers Her toes touch the duffel bag as
Gwen pulls in closer

NIKKI

across the room Her body drops to the floor in a second

revolver her eyes wide open

in the curtains

the duffel bag She slides it over to Ritchie

He freezes He crouches down and unzips it He pulls it
open to reveal a shit load of cash

There’s a lot more than fifty
grand in there

pocket He reaches in and pulls out his phone His eyes
widen as he looks at the caller ID “Nikki cell” flashes on
the screen

RITCHIE
Where’s your phone

Nikki rushes to her feet She throws open her jacket
Nothing She empties out her purse No phone She joins
Ritchie and looks down at the flashing screen

Who would do such a thing

PETE
If there is a “who” I’1l find

between Ritchie’s fingers as he stands by

He watches Nikki make neat little stacks of hundreds on the
living room floor One last bill is placed on one last
pile

RITCHIE
So

NIKKI
Two-fifty even

RITCHIE

(to himself)

Two-fifty

NIKKI

Blood

The machine BEEPS the coffee’s ready He turns to the
waiting mugs

She makes her way to him He keeps his eyes on the gun
She sets it down on the counter

NIKKI
I was gonna do it Ritchie I
was gonna blow him away for
her for that pile of paper
over there

Her gaze drifts towards the little money village on the
living room floor

He reaches out slowly and takes the gun He flicks the
safety on and slides it away from her

NIKKI
Why can’t we just run

RITCHIE
Do you know who this guy is

NIKKI
Some dirty cop

RITCHIE
That’s a fucking understatement

She gets back to the stacks He sips and watches her as she
gets on the floor

RITCHIE
Do you remember the guy I used
to run with Sammy “Two Balls”
Nikki runs her

NIKKI
Yeah

RITCHIE
Do you know what happened to
him

NIKKI
He was shot Drug deal gone
sideways right

RITCHIE
This “dirty cop” He busted
Sammy one day with half a key in
his pants but instead of
booking him he tried to make a
deal Sammy didn’t make deals
with cops

hands through the stacks

NIKKI
So he shot him

RITCHIE
No He wanted to make an example
out of him He had a dozen

dealers just like Sammy in his
pocket Not to mention cookers
junkies gangbangers psychos
and half of the downtown police
department He had a reputation
to protect

The cash covers the floor now

RITCHIE
He makes a call one day and
sends Sammy a message that not
only makes it to his ear but
right through his fucking skull

NIKKI
Where were you

Ritchie struggles with the answer

RITCHIE
I delivered it

NIKKI
(looks up)
No shit
RITCHIE

He caught me with blood on my
hands about a month earlier
Figured we can “help each other
out”

NIKKI
How much blood

RITCHIE
Enough to put me away for a long
time

NIKKI

So let’s make a deal then
Either that or we kill him

RITCHIE
I thought of that Dirty or not
though he’s still a cop That’s
a hard kill

handfuls of money from the floor She watches him

NIKKI
How many people have you killed

RITCHIE
What

NIKKI
He found you with blood on your
hands Counting Sammy that’s at
least two right
Sl

RITCHIE
I wouldn’t say they were people
Ten years ago you catch me with
a smoking gun I surrender no
problem What did I know But
after five years inside your
perspective changes a bit You
tend not to wanna go for the
repeat After that the choice
between smoking some lowlife and
doing hard time again isn’t a
choice at all

NIKKI
I’ve never killed anyone before

RITCHIE
It was an accident Don’t
torture yourself

NIKKI
What am I supposed to do

He avoids the question Continues to fill the bag

NIKKI
Do you believe in God Ritchie

RITCHIE
(filling the bag)
What’s the difference

NIKKI
It changes things

RITCHIE
Oh yeah

NIIKI
Yeah We’re either a bunch of
meat and bones or there’s a
soul swimming around in here
somewhere

His eyes go to the teddy bear on the kitchen counter
NIKKI
If he’s just make-believe we
have nothing to worry about but
if he’s out there we’re in
deep shit

He’s done filling the bag

RITCHIE
I wouldn’t worry too much about
God
NIKKI
Why not
RITCHIE
Look around he ain’t here

There’s a KNOCK at the door They look at each other

NIKKI
Maybe that’s him

Ritchie goes to answer it

THE DOOR IS KICKED IN smashing him over the face He’s
sent flying across the room

Nikki jumps to her feet

Franky and Rocco enter the apartment followed by Mike He
Manages to get the rattled door closed behind him She
grabs the duffel bag

NIKKI
What do you retards want

Mike paces behind his two large friends Ritchie tries to
catch his breath

MIKE
My sister has a boy with Down
Syndrome Great kid That term
cuts like a knife every time I
hear it

Mike looks around

MIKE
We’re gonna take all that dough
I saw you rolling around in

Mike sizes her up

MIKE
And while we’re at it I think

Franky licks his lips Nikki reaches into the bag

MIKE
I think I’1l have Franky knock
your teeth out first though

Ritchie spits out some blood

RITCHIE
Take your boys and go Mike
That’s all the warning you’re
gonna get

MIKE
(laughing)
Are you serious

Ritchie stumbles to his feet

MIKE
I’m not giving you a warning
Ritchie I’m making you a
promise - a promise that these
men will do terrible things to
you and your girl tonight if you
don’t step aside

Ritchie’s shoulders and neck let out a couple of awful
cracks as he straightens out

He looks over at Nikki She has her hand deeper in the bag
Their eyes meet

RITCHIE
(to Mike)
This isn’t a fair fight

Nikki’s hand is elbow deep in the duffel bag

RITCHIE
You should go get a couple more
guys
Everyone is frozen
Mike laughs
MIKE

Fuck him up boys

Franky winds up a powerful right that slices through the
air Ritchie ducks out of the way and lands a knee hard
into his ribs His elbow follows fast and shatters Franky’s
jaw

Franky’s body slumps to the carpet revealing Rocco coming
right for them

He lunges at Ritchie and is stopped in his tracks by a big
boot to the balls A ferocious right to Rocco’s face sends

blood and spit flying onto Mike’s wife-beater

He’s knocked out instantly and crashes to the floor at
Mike’s feet

A yellow smile appears on Mike’s sweaty face

how to do it properly

Above his head is a shelf labeled “CLEAN” It’s covered in
folded hospital gowns He puts one on over his clothes

He follows the nurse to a lone incubator near the back
window

The nurse steps aside with a smile and reveals a tiny body
inside - blindfolded attached to a mess of wires and
tubes little chest breathing heavily

It’s alright

Ritchie pulls the teddy bear out and rests it on the
plastic box

NURSE
Take your time

He examines the helpless little guy in the box

He comes around to her side She stares out the windshield

He looks around The street lamps sparkle in the wet
pavement

He lights a cigarette takes a deep drag and drops his head
in defeat

He knocks on her window
She rolls it down her eyes still focused on the street

There was a girl Things got
serious but then quickly turned
to shit so she bailed Showed
up six months later with a sob
story and a baby-bump

She finally turns to face him

RITCHIE
A blast from her past saw her
crossing the street one day and
decided to run her over with his

A car speeds by and interrupts him

RITCHIE
They managed to save the kid
but he won’t wake up They

tell me I’m wasting my time and
money - that I should pull the
plug and move on His
heartbeat’s stronger than mine
and they’re telling me to shut
it down like it’s nothing

NIKKI
What are you holding on to That
kid doesn’t belong here
RITCHIE
Like you said we’re more than
just meat right

He flicks his cigarette into the street

He walks away

following

Pete sits in Trent’s chair with Nikki’s phone in his hands
He looks through its contents

Trent is occupied with Heather on the couch He whispers
bullshit into her ear and she fakes a few giggles She’s

practically bursting out of a skin-tight dress

Ritchie and Nikki walk through the door Pete stands up

this phone do not do you
justice

He reaches out his hand

Her eyes go to Ritchie Pete takes back his meaty paw
They sit down He continues browsing through her phone

PETE
There are a lot of pictures in
here Some of them I have to
confess I already jerked-off
to but a few others I’m just
not that into

He flips the cell over so they can see a picture of a
bloodied Gwen on the screen He shuffles blindly to more
shots of her from different angles

Nikki’s face goes white

PETE (0S)
I’m no Ansel Adams but --

RITCHIE
What do you want Pete

He puts the phone down

PETE

I live in the shade Ritchie as
you know I pull the strings on
dozens of puppet shows but that
doesn’t mean I’m not a serious
businessman This studio
is one of the good ones We make
quality movies here

TRENT
(interrupting)

PETE
Films The talent as you can
see is top notch

Ritchie looks over at Heather

PETE
Cash and pussy go in and out of
here like fucking clockwork
Most of it lands right into our
laps too but a lot of it
doesn’t quite make the trip

He leans in closer

PETE
(To Nikki)
Can you give us a minute honey
Maybe ten

Nikki looks around

NIKKI
Where do you want me to go

PETE
Trent Why don’t you give this
young lady the tour

Trent drops Heather in a flash and gets to his feet

TRENT
Of course

He straightens his tie and pats down his hair as he struts
to the desk He gives her his hand

NIKKI
(to Pete)
I don’t want the tour I wanna
know what I need to do to get
out of this shit

PETE
(deadpan)

You need to take the tour

Nikki looks at Ritchie He nods

NIKKI
Whatever

She walks out Trent follows
Pete turns around to Heather who is still on the couch

PETE
You too sweetheart

Heather jumps up and jiggles all the way out the door Pete
gets back to business

PETE

In order for this machine to
keep working we have to deal
with certain silent partners
backers that provide various
necessary services that keep the
whole thing moving smoothly
These guys they partnered up
with a local financier and made
him their official talent scout
The guy’s a fucking scumbag

RITCHIE
That’s funny

PETE
He takes all the best girls and
leaves us with scraps So
instead of getting a decent
stable set up we’re left
scrounging the bottom of the
pile every time Make-up and
lighting can only do so much

RITCHIE
Seems like a no-brainer Your
reach should go way past this
type of shit

PETE
Believe it or not it doesn’t

He leans back again hesitating for once

PETE
The backers are in the Russian
mob
Ritchie’s face goes cold
PETE

And like I said they’re head-
over-heels for this jerk-off so
he’s not budging

RITCHIE
Russians

PETE
I don’t want this to go down
like a regular hit I need it to
be done different

RITCHIE
Different How long is it gonna
take for the Russians to find
out who fucked up their new BFF

Ritchie pulls out his pack of smokes and lights up

PETE
This morning I show up and
there you are like a fucking
sign so I asked You said
“no” Now you’re here

He holds up the phone

PETE
And here So I’m asking
again Same deal as last time

Asking huh

Ritchie lets out a cloud from his lungs

him

and panting like a wild animal

For the first time a smile appears on Ritchie’s face His
strides get more confident as he heads back to the nursery

Suddenly A LOUD VOICE BLARES OVER THE PA SYSTEM

Code Pink Code Pink

Ritchie’s smile is history

Nurses and orderlies rush past him down the hall They
burst through the nursery’s entrance

A BEAUTIFUL ANGELIC VOICE pierces through the chaos and
drowns out all the sound - A CHOIR SINGER belts out a
haunting hymn as Ritchie approaches the nursery’s open
doorway

The medical staff struggles to resuscitate his boy

THE VOICE HITS ITS HIGHEST NOTE as the heart monitor flat-
lines

All emotion drains out of Ritchie’s face

A CHOIR is in the middle of a practice

The angelic voice continues to engulf all the world’s
sound It belongs to A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL at the front of
the group

A few parishioners are spread out in the pews

Ritchie sits way in the back row His trademark frown
planted firmly back on his face his hand on the duffel bag

beside him

He’s motionless lost in thought watching but not
focused

A priest emerges from a confessional and greets one of the
parishioners

The girl’s voice fights to get into Ritchie’s heart but
suddenly gives up Silence Ritchie snaps out of his

trance

He looks down at the bag and slowly takes away his hand

He gets up

The priest spots him

Ritchie walks out The duffel stays behind The priest
approaches

EXT DOWNTOWN CHURCHSTEPS

Ritchie stands in the cool morning air He lights a
cigarette and takes the smoke deep into his lungs

POLICE SIRENS in the distance CAR HORNS and the YELLS of
drivers in the throws of road-rage mix with jumbled MUSIC
and a ton of INDISCERNIBLE CITY NOISE

Ritchie takes it all in The chaos speaks to him
RITCHIE
(sotto)
Shit

He flicks his cigarette away

INT DOWNTOWN CHURCH

The priest has the duffel open His eyes wide at the sight
of the cash inside

PRIEST
Praise the lord

A hand reaches in and quickly cuts his moment short

The priest jumps back as Ritchie takes the bag He even
fights to let go for a second joy replaced with shock

RITCHIE
Sorry father Forgot my bag

Ritchie exits and leaves the priest standing there
speechless

EXT RITCHIE’S CAR
Ritchie tosses the bag into his car before dropping into
the drivers seat He starts it up fast and peels out even

faster

He disappears into the chaos
