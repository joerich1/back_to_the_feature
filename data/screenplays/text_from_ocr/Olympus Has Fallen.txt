Meet MIKE BANNING Good-looking 30s build of a former
college athlete Wearing the unmistakable shades and coiled
earpiece of the United States Secret Service

The other Sno-Cats pull up under Banning’s watchful gaze

under her knit cap
BANNING

Connor face nearly blue bravely shakes his head no

Banning reaches out tweaks the visor of the boy’s helmet
Connor beams back hero-worship personified

TRUMBULL
(to Asher only half-
joking)
Can’t be any colder than the
reception your foreign policy
initiative’s gettin’ on the Hill

MAGGIE
It’s the will of the people Marty
That’s what matters --

ASHER

BANNING

He casts a sideways look at Trumbull Maggie laughs

MAGGIE
Dodged like a true politician --
(she puts her helmet back
on)
Well I don’t know about the rest

And in the dimness below

stares up at him hair streaming behind her Floating away
into the frozen depths

Banning struggles down to her Face contorted in pain

He’s out of air

He keeps diving A superhuman effort His hand reaches
out and
GRABS MAGGIE’S ARM

Banning pulls her toward the surface Dim light flickering
through the frozen ice above

He reaches for his shoulder holster and

DRAWS HIS SIG SAUER P229
Banning aims the gun straight up

What is he doing --

BLAM BLAM BLAM
ON THE LAKE
Gun blasts blow a GAPING HOLE in the frozen ice

Banning BURSTS from below Roma and O’Neil race up Pull
Maggie from the frigid water

They lay her on the ice Eyes rolled back unmoving O’Neil
desperately administers CPR

Asher drops to his knees Nearly delirious with disbelief
and fear O’Neil frantically tries to revive her

Banning can only stare trembling in the bitter cold

Presses a button on the key which causes it to VIBRATE for a
