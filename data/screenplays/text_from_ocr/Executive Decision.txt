14 EXT HOTEL COURTYARD (NICOSIA CYPRUS) - LATE AFTERNOON 14

FROM the sun we SLOWLY TILT DOWN INTO the courtyard the
MOVE ENDING as an explosion of white doves fluttering
into the air revealing a Muslim wedding party the
guests gathered around the bride and groom both early
20s The attendants are all well-dressed affluent
Arabs most in western attire

SUBTITLES NICOSIA CYPRUS

Cautiously the bride looks up toward a balcony Where
four men strategically positioned watch the proceedings
below The men all Arabs in casual western attire are
focused not on the wedding party but the balconies and
windows around them Deep in the shadows a fifth man
wearing dark glasses is barely visible

15 EXT BALCONY - LATE AFTERNOON 15

The fifth man emerges removing his dark glasses the
terrorist ABD SAUD JAFFA a name synonymous with death
of medium height late 50s he imparts an instant chill-
ing presence skin soft and paunchy dark circles of
flesh beneath his eyes -- heartless cold as ice be-
speaking evil and treachery As we study his face the
following SUBTITLES APPEAR

Abd Saud Jaffa once the most
notorious and feared terrorist in
the world now a desperate hunted
man his sanctuaries nearly
exhausted betrayed by even his own
people

15

Beside him is his chief of staff ALI NAGI HASSAN early
30s a complex highly-intelligent man responsible for
Jaffas security and middle man to outside organizations
A man of considerable power but exercised only on behalf
and at the behest of Jaffa -- an man who never dictates
policy only carrying it out At the moment he is
extremely anxious at this careless exposure of a man
carrying death warrants even from his own people Ali
glances at his watch

ALI HASSAN
(subtitles)
Jaffa we must go We have stayed
too long There are many on this
island who would betray you

Jaffa turns holding up his hand in a gesture of
restraint He focuses on his beautiful daughter below
radiant in this moment He motions to her indicating an
adjoining courtyard below She excuses herself from the
party Jaffa turning to descend a staircase Ali is
upset by this recklessness but dogged in his determina-
tion to maintain security He turns to one of the
guards

ALI HASSAN
(subtitles)
Check the street then bring up
the cars

EXT COURTYARD - DAY 16

Elegant a stone fountain as the centerpiece Jaffa ex-
tends his hands to his daughter who complies obediently
she too in awe of this powerful dangerous man a man she
has rarely seen Jaffa embraces her and then presses
something into her hand a small gilded box He speaks
softly to her

Suddenly Ali is there He nods differentially to the
daughter and then whispers anxiously to Jaffa

ALI HASSAN
(subtitles)
The plane cannot wait any longer
We must go please

Jaffa bids a final farewell to his daughter and then
turns nodding quickly to Ali

The double makes momentary eye contact with Jaffa and
Ali Jaffa nods his approval The man puts on dark
glasses and the decoy team heads rapidly down the hall

EXT NICOSIA HOTEL - LATE AFTERNOON 17

Now parked in the curved driveway is a Fiat sedan a
driver behind the wheel

Another car is parked in front of the Fiat its driver
unloading baggage for an Orthodox Greek priest who stands
waiting on the sidewalk eyes half-closed feeling the
heat of the sun on his upturned face

From the hotel lobby two of Jaffas guards emerge one
standing lookout the other walking quickly to the Fiat
Looking cautiously about he leans into the driver giving
instructions The driver starts the car but before he
can back up a taxi whips in behind trapping it between
the two cars

Three men obviously drunk stumble from the cab and
head for the lobby arm-in-arm talking loudly in German

The terrorist beside the Fiat moves towards the cab
shouting at the driver to back up The taxi driver
emerges shouting back at the terrorist They meet at
the rear of the car arguing Suddenly the taxi driver
reaches to his back whipping free a silenced 22 Beretta
automatic In a flash the gun is under the chin of the
bodyguard a soft THUMP as the GUN is FIRED

The driver lays the dead bodyguard in the street swing-
ing out and around the car leveling FIRING TWICE the
driver in the Fiat slumping down in the seat

At the same moment the three drunken men reach the lobby
doors one of them pulling a silenced pistol pressing it
into the lookouts stomach FIRING As he sits the dead
man into the base of a potted tree the other two push
through the doors

INT LOBBY - DAY 18

As Jaffa and the remaining guard descend the stairs a
BUSINESSMAN seated at a couch folds a paper and picking
up a briefcase follows in behind them

The two boisterous drunks spill through the doors but as
they approach Jaffa and his bodyguard pull their pistols
as the Businessman moves in from behind shoving a pistol
into the bodyguards back a quick spin another soft
THUMP and the bodyguard drops to the floor

As the stunned patrons and employees look on Jaffa is
moved quickly toward the doors the Businessman speaking
into a lapel mike on his suit

AGENT (BUSINESSMAN)
(in English)
We have number one Move
( )

The three men push Jaffa out the door and down the
stairs

EXT HOTEL - DAY 19

A late-model MERCEDES SQUEALS INTO VIEW the back door
flying open as more agents leap out Jaffa is shoved
into the back seat

Just then Jaffas backup car pulls around the corner and
into the driveway The three terrorists inside realize
what is happening the doors fling open their weapons
drawn

At this moment the Greek priest who has been backing
away in mock horror at the kidnapping clears a MACH TEN
MACHINE GUN from his robes his driver pulling a similar
weapon from the trunk The two OPEN FIRE the terrorists
in the backup car disappearing in a hail of EXPLODING
GLASS and ruptured metal The priest and driver jump
into their car pulling out

As the MERCEDES PEELS OUT behind the priests car the
businessman leaps into the taxi hiking out the window

and over the roof FIRING several rounds into the tires
and radiator of the Fiat with a SILENCED PISTOL A second
later one of the priests suitcases on the sidewalk
EXPLODES a dense cloud of CS gas enveloping the area
providing cover

INT HOTEL - UPPER BALCONY - DAY 20

Ali Hassan hearing the faint but distinctive SILENCED
SHOTS rushes from the room a machine pistol in his
hand Seeing the abduction below he leaps from the
balcony onto the roof running across the tiles towards
the street

He sights in on the Businessman hiked out over the cab
but stops short seeing the silhouette of Jaffa framed
in the back seat too dangerous a shot for a machine gun
Unwilling to risk hitting him Ali throws out his arms
screaming a cry of defiance and revenge his eyes wild
with anger and hatred

As the car whips its way through the narrow streets we
hear the following VOICE OVER as we view the series of
news reports of terrorist activities including the bomb-
ing of a disco aircraft wreckage bombing of a military
hospital etc

molded and painted section of plaster revealing the
slides of two automatic pistols He then removes two
camera pistol grips pulling each away from its unit

ist storms into the galley slamming Judy across the
chest knocking her unconscious against the bulkhead

her head striking the counter with a sickening THUD as

trays

He nods As she turns back to her work the Terrorist
pulls from his pocket a small wedge of plastic explo-

sive with a fuse attached Pressing the plastic into

the seam by the door latch and pulling the igniter he
calmly steps back revealing his handgun

A sharp EXPLOSION blasts the door free from the lock

As the startled passengers watch in shock the Terrorist
rushes inside brutally pistol-whipping the flight
engineer as he stands then pressing the muzzle into

the pilots neck

ting behind the sailor

Behind him there is a CRASH Ali spins raising his
weapon stopping as he sees an attendant NANCY backing
into the partition holding her hands over her face her
eyes wide with fear and horror Ali studies her calmly
appraisinlgy and then dismissing her hands the weapon to
Kahlil the photojournalist As if his point has been
made Ali walks swiftly down the aisle not bothering to
look at another passenger

Somewhere in the main cabin a hand gripping a 357
Magnum partially removed from a belt holster hesitates
before returning the revolver Carefully the mans

hand unsnaps the holster sliding it and the gun down

to his feet where it is secreted in a dress boot pants
leg covering it Next his Federal ID wallet is slipped
between the seats

A wave of fear rolls through the passengers as they con-
front the horrible reality -- hijacked In a SERIES OF

Nancy into the station shoving them roughly into their
jump seats As Fran sits she looks up seeing the
passenger manifest hanging from the wall Her eyes go
to a name Edward Strickler 13-B United States Fed-
eral Air Marshal

As the terrorist turns his back she pulls the manifest
from the clipboard slipping it into a trash receptacle
She looks up just as Ali steps into the space He
removes his suit coat hanging it over some work aprons
on the bulkhead Lifting the intercom handset from the
wall he speaks calmly in perfect English

The Maitre d offended at this incursion follows after
him

MAITRE D
(indignant)
Excuse me sir but may I help you

The man reaches the center of the restaurant

MAITRE D
Do you have a reservation

The man turns the Maitre d staring into the glazed eyes
of death In that frozen moment the Maitre d notices
the man is sweating heavily his breathing shallow

The man slowly opens his coat revealing a canvas vest to
which are taped a dozen blocks of plastic explosive
fused and wired together in series He holds out his
arm revealing a detonator switch crudely taped to his
palm two wires running up his sleeve

A frozen moment of hesitation and then the man lifting

possibly calling for some
extraordinary measures Thats
why youre here

Travis looks around at the sober faces staring at him
He seems to be the center of attention -- as if hes
the last to be brought in on something He turns
back to Kaplan

KAPLAN

The immediate situation is this
The Prime Minister is demanding
Jaffas release or hell take
action on his own Were going
to comply to gain some time at
least

(to Sarlow)
General Sarlow

GENERAL SARLOW

A number of Arab factions are
willing to attempt negotiations
with Jaffas group but unless
the highjackers elect to make
contact our options are
severely limited

(looks at Grant)
Im going to ask Captain Grant to
continue Hes the best expert
we have on Arab terrorists and
hes been on the highjacking since
we first learned of it

Grant addresses the group but focuses on Travis again
as if this is for his benefit Grant refers to a

series of

documents taken from his briefcase

GRANT
Based upon a voice print Im
certain Al Iqab is Ali Hassan
Jaffas second in command For
such a high-ranking member to
actually be in charge is highly
unusual

He pauses Travis cautiously acknowledging

TRAVIS
Yes highly unusual 50

GRANT
Then Im sure you would also agree
Colonel that taking hostages to
spring Jaffa makes sense but not
coming here They can secure his
release and never leave Europe

Again Travis stares coolly at Grant

TRAVIS
Obviously Hassan is up to something

GRANT

Jaffa knew his effectiveness as a
terrorist was over and was in the
process of portraying himself a
moderate another Arafat But Ali
has always represented the hard
line fundamental position

(beat)
Rather then take a Mossad bullet in
the head he would rather go out
striking a blow at the Great Satan
The Sword of Gods Will

(beat)
His nom de guerre Al Iqab is
deeply rooted in Arabic culture
associated with suicidal vengeance
It means The Punishment

TRAVIS
So whats the punch line

Grant refers to an open folder before him

GRANT
Less than a week ago a small
Russian army convoy was ambushed
outside of Ashkhabad near the
Iranian border Ten men were
killed a truck hijacked

He places several satellite photographs on the table

showing the burned wreckage of several Jeeps and soldiers
lying on the road

GRANT
Recent intelligence gives us strong
reason to believe Jaffas group
was responsible
(beat)
The cargo of that truck consisted
of 42 canisters of DZ-5 being
relocated to a secret storage
facility
( ) 50
Travis stiffens slightly at the mention of the word

GRANT
DZ-5 is the latest generation of a
biogenic nerve toxin far more
lethal than any chemical weapon
weve ever seen

He places several photographs on the table showing Middle
Eastern tribesmen and soldiers lying in contorted and
misshapen heaps one photograph showing a Kurdish tribes-
woman clutching a baby their faces frozen masks of
agony gasping for their last breath of life

TRAVIS
(sober )
Im aware of its capabilities
Captain

Grant stops his briefing finished for the moment
He looks to Director Nelson the DCI who picks up
a computer printout

DCI

A cross-check of the passenger
and cargo manifests Colonel
indicates a shipment of ‘art
objects leaded pottery 250
kilos in weight on board
Flight 343

(beat)
The point of origin final
destination and the person assigned
to that shipment are all non-
existent

Kaplan now resumes but Travis clearly understands
the situation Grant carefully studying his reaction

KAPLAN
We have to consider Colonel
Travis the strong possibility that
gaining the release of Jaffa is
only the first phase of a larger
plan

TRAVIS
(grave)
A major strike against the US

Again Grant speaks up referring to his notes He is
obviously well prepared for this briefing

thru 50

GRANT
Assuming only 10 canisters
airburst over Washington we
could expect between 50000 to
100000 deaths Anything inside
a hundred miles of the coastline
would be disastrous

A frozen moment and then Kaplan looks directly at

Travis

KAPLAN
(gravely)
Meaning Colonel Travis if this
scenario is true the President
would have no other choice but to
order the plane destroyed

TRAVIS
(confused)
Yes sir no other choice But Im
at a loss Mr Kaplan If this
is all true where does my team fit
in

Kaplan glances at Grant then to the DCI

KAPLAN
Because weve been told we may
have another option Colonel
Which does concern you
(to Nelson)
Lets get on with it gentlemen

Nelson nods to one of his aides who leaves the room

OMITTED

DCI
Its a wild card Colonel but
under the circumstances its all
weve got Youve already met I
think Peter Cahill an
aeronautical engineer at DARPA a
pioneer in stealth technology

thru

INT OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY 54

CLOSE ON a video screen where a computerized blueprint is
displayed a drawing of a double-walled ovoid cylinder
at the top of which is an inner and outer o-ring device
a series of circular sucker-like cups attached to a
collection of pneumatic pumps

The image changes an engineers drawing showing the
cylinder similar to a submarines conning tower
attached to the top of a radically designed executive-
style jet with stealth characteristics featuring
swept-back wings and a horizontal rather than vertical
tail

Another drawing shows the cylinder telescoped upward
several times its original size the delivery plane now
positioned beneath and mated with an aircraft many times
its size a giant XB-70 bomber

Suddenly Travis gets the picture understanding where he
fits into the loop

TRAVIS
Jesus H Christ

All eyes are on Travis

TRAVIS

Excuse me Mr Kaplan but I see
where youre going with this My
team is thoroughly versed in
carrying out assaults on hijacked
aircraft But on the ground not
five miles above the earth

(beat)
I informed Mr Cahill two years
ago that we had little use for
this aircraft in Special Ops
This thing was designed to
transfer flight crews to and from
strategic bombers requiring
special adaptation to the aircraft

(looks at Cahill)
Its application with a civilian
aircraft was dismissed as posing
too great a risk to the
passengers A hijacked aircraft
eventually has to land somehwere
where we can deal with it

Travis realizes the irony of his last statement even
before Kaplan speaks up

KAPLAN

This does appear to be the
exception to the rule

(beat)
We said this was a wild card
Colonel But if your team can
board that airplane determine if
there is a bomb and take control
of the situation we at least have
a fighting chance Otherwise
four hundred and six passengers
will have to be sacrificed

(sober intense)
The President does not want to
shoot down that plane Colonel
but he will He cannot risk
50000 American lives

(beat)
In his words this is a Hail Mary
pass He has no other options

Kaplan continues to look at Travis

TRAVIS
How much time

Grant speaks up

GRANT
You have to be airborne within the
hour

Travis thinks a moment and then nods the soldiers

acceptance of duty He looks at Cahill

TRAVIS
One question You have enough
confidence in this gadget to stake
your life on it under these

circumstances

CAHILL
Its been modified the pumps
much stronger Even without the

mating collar there is an
appropriate hatch on the 747 and
the wide surface area of the
aircraft should be sufficient for
a link-up

(beat)
Id have to say I have extreme
confidence in its application
even under the less than optimum
circumstances

54A 54

TRAVIS
Well good Because I want you to
go along I dont want anything
left to chance

Cahill is stunned He starts to speak but a withering
look from the DCI shuts him up Cahill looks sick
Kaplan speaks up dealing his last card

KAPLAN
I think one addition to the team
is called for Colonel An expert
in Arabic dialects someone who
has made a careful study of Alis
life who knows how he thinks how
he operates

Travis turns and looks at Grant their eyes locking
This was unanticipated by Grant and his face shows it
The Major-General Traviss boss speaks up

MAJOR-GENERAL
I see absolutely no need for
Captain Grants involvement in the
actual operation He can
accomplish an advisory role right
from here in Operations

KAPLAN
On the contrary General I think
his actual presence could prove
crucial Captain Grant might be
able to forecast something Ali is
going to do before he does it

MAJOR-GENERAL
Mr Kaplan its going to be
difficult enough for the Colonel
and his men
Travis speaks out
TRAVIS
Excuse me General I11 take
him He could prove useful
He fixes Grant with a look that says Okay lets see
how you handle the real thing
EXT AIRFORCE BASE - OPEN JEEP - DAWN 54A

Moving swiftly across the flight line passing hangars
and military aircraft

54A

Traviss Special Forces driver is at the wheel Travis
in the front seat Grant in the rear Grant windblown
and chilled seems uncomfortable and nervous a marked
change from his confident bearing at the Pentagon
Travis turns in his seat

TRAVIS
Curious why I didnt vote against
your coming Captain

Grant is curious but remains silent

TRAVIS
Because this whole operation was
your idea wasnt it Your little
brainstorm

The look on Grants face says it all

GRANT
Thats what I get paid for
Colonel

TRAVIS

And my boys get paid for putting
it on the line Im not faulting
your ideas Captain Like Kaplan
said under the circumstances its
a brilliant plan And crazy
enough that it just might work

(beat)
Except we know we shouldnt be
doing it in the first place dont
we

GRANT
(uncomfortable)
Im not sure I follow you sir

TRAVIS
Then Ill enlighten you Where
you intel boys fucked up was
cooking up this hare-brained
scheme to put Jaffa on trial in
the first place

GRANT
Youre mistaken Colonel We had
nothing to do with Jaffas
abduction

54A 540

TRAVIS
Oh horse shit I know a hell of
a lot more about what goes on in
your world than you think It was
a CIA op an executive decision
from the beginning We both play
for the same team Captain The
only difference is you dont have
to pull the trigger

GRANT
I had no involvement with that
operation Colonel

(beat)

But I agree with it in principle
Jafa is an international criminal
and had to be brought to justice
Men like that have to know theyre
not beyond the reach of the law

TRAVIS
Law The only law animals like
Jaffa and Ali understand comes
from the end of a gun
(beat)
You should have killed them all
when you had the chance

Grant reflects on this

GRANT
Well thats all a moot point
isnt it No matter what Jaffa
is home free

A cold look from Travis

TRAVIS
Dont count on it Captain

The Jeep pulls to a halt beside a massive hangar just as
a CH-46 HELICOPTER ROARS INTO VIEW over the top quickly
settling to the tarmac Travis and Grant turning to avoid
the prop wash

Emerging from the helicopter are seven men wearing watch
caps dark green pullovers black cargo-pocketed pants
and light weight crepe-soled boots Quickly they unload
dark duffel bags and ABS plastic suitcases

Travis swings from the Jeep leaving Grant behind making
his way to the team They cluster momentarily Travis
warmly greeting them

54A 540

Grant sees a very close-knit highly motivated and
bonded team but he sees as well the fear in their eyes
the adrenaline rush and as they glance towards him the
automatic distrust of outsiders

TRAVIS
(shouting)
Outstanding gentlemen Any
problems

One of the men BAKER good-natured wide beaming face
speaks up

BAKER
(shouting)
Almost missed Cappy Caught him
in his driveway pole in his hand
headed for the Keys

Travis looks across at CAPPY 48 black lean chiseled
intelligent features wearing in contrast to the others a
black insulated jumpsuit covered with dozens of pockets
and pouches On his head is a floppy fatigue hat several
trout flies in the brim

CAPPY
(shouting)
Damn near made it too

Several of the men look up seeing Grant as he
approaches Travis turns looking at Grant

TRAVIS
Boys this is Captain Grant ISA
Hes along in case we get into any
serious trouble Lets go Well
brief in flight

The men pick up their gear walking towards the hangar
Another of the men a wiry intense Chicano nicknamed
RAT for his expertise in surreptitious entry looks
around him searching for something

RAT
Colonel I dont see the support

TRAVIS
Not this time Rat Were

The huge doors begin to part

INT HANGAR (AIR FORCE BASE) - DAY 55

As the DOORS RUMBLE open the men walk forward casting
long backlit shadows before them as they step through the
hangar doors

They stop staring at something inside the cavernous hangar

BAKER
What the hell is that

CHARLIE
(pilots drawl)
Well it aint made the cover of
Popular Mechanics

REVERSE ANGLE 55A

we see a hawk-like aircraft of black anodized titanium
so rakish and streamlined it looks almost in flight just
sitting on the ground A flight crew finishing last
minute services and checks on the high-tech bird remove
their service equipment the pilots entering the craft

As the team approaches the plane Cahill appears from
inside He calls out to Travis gesturing towards the men

CAHILL
(shouting)
Too much weight Never designed for
this many -- never get off the ground

(beat)
And were running late For every
minute were here we have to make
up ten in the air Got to go

Travis turns to the men pointing to the equipment

TRAVIS
(shouting)
Cut it down Close-quarter
weapons bomb kit detection and
surveillance gear and the sleep
agent Dump the rest Lets go

Immediately the team begins digging through the equip-
ment taking only the essential items leaving the rest
on the hangar floor As Travis and Grant stand next to
each other Traviss Driver appears

DRIVER
Sir I have your call to SAS

Where in the dim light of the cold cell Jaffa sits on
his bunk dressed in gray overalls Suddenly the heavy
steel door swings open and several American MPs enter
pulling Jaffa to his feet putting him in handcuffs As
the startled Jaffa is led from his cell he sees an
American diplomat staring at him coldly from the
hallway As hes ushered down the hall Jaffa realizes
something significant has taken place

EXT ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE (NEAR LONDON) - DAY 58

A convoy of US and British military vehicles flies
past on a country highway the access roads blocked by
military police A sign reading LONDON 150km is
seen in the fg

In the third vehicle from the lead Jaffa sits in an
armored Range Rover surrounded by soldiers the diplo-
mat seated beside him

INT DELIVERY PLANE —- DAY 59

We PULL BACK to reveal the interior spartan but func-
tional Fold-down jump seats accommodate the team the
rear of the jet devoted to racks of miniaturized elec-
tronic and navigational gear The predominant feature
of the jet however is the dome-like appendage swelling
from the ceiling near the cockpit A pressurized hatch
is located in the center of the dome surrounded by a
series of gauges levers and switches

The ship is intermittently buffeted by turbulence
obviously not the best of flying conditions The men
are intense and highly focused as they listen to
Travis briefing of the bizarre mission they are about
to undertake Grant is obviously the outsider sitting
near the rear of the aircraft

59

TRAVIS
The stakes are high on this one
gentlemen the most important
mission weve ever been handed
This assault is untested and
carries more than the usual element
of chance but under the
circumstances its the only chance
those people on board have

A quick look to Grant then to Cahill

TRAVIS
Otherwise its a standard
suppression op just as if we had
boarded on the ground
(beat)
All right lets go through it
Baker

Baker turns to a video screen part of a portable high-
tech communication and tracking system He plots a
simulated course showing an intercept point of the 747
and the delivery plane over the Atlantic

BAKER

The 747s transponder and radar
is off but the E2 now has a fix
on them Our intercept should be
about here roughly an hour out of
London

(beat)
That gives us four hours on board
before she reaches the hundred
mile limit

TRAVIS
Give me that schematic

Baker snaps an exploded-view cell showing the 747 in
intricate detail into a light box The team studies
the glowing back-lit schematic

TRAVIS
Grant youre up after Baker find
a hole and sit tight while Baker
sets up the intercom link with the
Pentagon Sleep-agent is next
Rat five bottles on the port
manifold Charlie five on
starboard

Grants voice breaks in drawing several annoyed looks
from the men

CATMAN 59

GRANT
Excuse me Colonel Youre
using sodium chloral-hydrate

TRAVIS
(surprised)
Youve done your homework Any
problems with that

GRANT
In the tests of SCH Ive been
briefed on the effects on most
subjects was a gradual drowsiness
for about thirty seconds before
unconsciousness

TRAVIS
(curious )
Correct Whats your point

GRANT
Thirty seconds may be too long
Ali is highly intelligent acts
instinctually by nature suspicious
of everything The slightest
indication his mission has been
comprised could result ina
disastrous reaction on his part

Travis considers this

TRAVIS
Good point Baker

BAKER
I can increase the saturation
Itll put ‘em out instantly but
its pretty risky We could lose
someone before we cycle the gas
out

Travis looks at Grant

TRAVIS
Increase it Well take the chance
Catman you ready to fly it

smooth confident a pilots manual for a 747
open on his lap looks up 59

CATMAN
Once we clear the flight crew from
the cockpit no problem Should
be on auto pilot but even if it
isnt plane pretty well flies
itself

TRAVIS
Once weve got control Rat you
and Cappy start the sweep through
the forward baggage compartment
If we find a bomb we divert
Baker

CATMAN
(checking his map)
SAC base at McNeil Greenland
is our best bet

RAT
And if this bitch has a short fuse

Cappy resolved opens a folding three-sectioned soft
case containing a fantastic array of miniature bomb tools
He looks up

CAPPY
Well then I guess your asses are
all mine

A sober moment passes through the group

TRAVIS
All right Thats it See to

Grant looks over at Cahill busily at work on a small
calculator-like device

Travis near the cockpit is busily typing on a satellite
transceiver unit a high-tech computer phone unit housed
inside a black aluminum case He enters a command and a
small plastic strip a magnetic code key emerges from a
slot He closes the case motioning for Grant

TRAVIS
Youll run the intel-board mikes
microwave scanners and video
probes Things run to plan
youre just along for the ride

He gives Grant the mag-key matter of factly

TRAVIS
Hang on to this Access key for a
scrambled transmission Im
expecting Little arrangement with
Cousin Reggie in England Youll
need this to patch me through
Code name is Executive Decision

Grant nods putting the code-key deep inside his shirt
pocket Travis looks at him studying him He grins

TRAVIS

By the way good call on the sleep
agent

(beat)
Youre the expert on Ali Tell me
aside from freeing Jaffa and
killing a lot of innocent Americans
what does he hope to gain from all
this

GRANT
If the attack on Washington were
successful sometime in the
aftermath with Americans at the
peak of their outrage no doubt
certain undeniable information
would be leaked to the West

TRAVIS
Leaked 59

GRANT
By Ali Set up before his suicide
Information implicating the country
who supplied Ali the nerve gas the
bomb the diplomatic support needed
to get the highjackers on board
So damning so

TRAVIS
That the US would be forced to
retaliate

GRANT

In Alis mind hopefully so swiftly
and devastatingly maybe even
nuclear that a Pan-Arabic war
would result the focus at the only
plausible target in the region
Israel

TRAVIS
And restoring Jaffa as a leading
power in the region as well Very
clever

GRANT
Inspiration born of desperation

TRAVIS
Sounds familiar doesnt it

They look at each other a new level of respect for their
situation passing between them

EXT DAY 60
The huge plane moves majestically onward on its course
across the Atlantic

INT 747 CABIN AREA - DAY 61
Silent as a tomb Terrorists armed with automatic

weapons are stationed at various locations on the plane
All of the window shades have been pulled down

A terrorist armed with an automatic weapon pistol and
grenade moves slowly down the long corridor his eyes
glaring at the passengers who sit terrified unable to

move or speak

61

He passes the mid-cabin area where Ali Hassan and two
others have set up a monitoring station adapted to the
planes gutted telephone system consisting of a SHORT-
WAVE RADIO over which can be heard a NEWS BROADCAST
and alongside it a military field radio

As the guard nears the front of the plane he walks
past a terrorist dragging the two murdered passengers
now covered in blood-stained blankets into one of the
forward bathrooms

We FOCUS ON the PARENTS of Karen and DAVID whispering
to each other in urgent voices

WIFE
I want them here with us

HUSBAND
No Theyre insane Theyve
already killed two people Were
going to sit here

WIFE
And do what

The terrorist guard passes by them then past Karen and
David As he does Karen looks across at the two Greek
boys silent terrified the priest beside them deep in
prayer eyes closed prayer beads moving through his
fingers One of the boys notices her staring back at
her with frightened eyes Suddenly on impulse Karen
stands moving into the aisle Her brother reacts
startled

DAVID
(under his breath)
Karen What are you doing Get
back here

But Karen stands in the aisle holding out to the Greek
boy a Nintendo game the boy remaining frozen staring
at her

Two rows back Karens mother looks up seeing Karen in
the aisle starts to rise when her husbands hand comes
down firmly on her arm

HUSBAND
(stern whisper)
No Dont move

Slowly they lean out trying to get Karens attention
without alerting the guard 61

As Karen holds out the game the Greek boy reaches out

to accept it A gun barrel flashes INTO VIEW the game
snatched from her hand Terrified faces freeze in place
priest children parents passengers as the terrorist
guard stares at the game Angrily he shoves Karen aside
shouting at her in Arabic As Karen begins to cry her
father unable to restrain himself lunges from his chair

FATHER
You son of a

The terrorist spins slamming the butt of his rifle into
the fathers chest driving him back into his seat
Instantly the barrel of the rifle is pressed hard into
his windpipe cutting off his air the father beginning
to choke His wife reaches out desperately pleading

WIFE
Please youre choking him
Please stop it

But the terrorist presses harder an angry sneer across
his face a very ugly situation about to get worse
Suddenly a hand reaches out grasping the gun barrel
Startled the terrorist looks up into Alis face Ali
pulls the gun away carefully backing the guard into the
aisle speaking softly to him in Arabic The terrorist
settles but glares back in anger at the father

Ali kneels to the floor picking up the game He
examines it and then hands it to the Greek boy

He helps Karen into her seat speaking to her in English

ALI
You must stay in your seat

He gently roughs her hair looking up into the frozen
faces of her parents and then into the faces of a

dozen other passengers all staring at him humbled with
fear As Ali looks from face to face he sees perhaps
for the first time the people the human souls who are
destined to die with him in his desperate statement to
the West He grows agitated and then speaks out almost
as a parent to a child explaining why the child must be
punished

ALT
I am not your enemy
(beat)
You have been betrayed by your own
leaders The supporters and

instigators of the Zionist occupation
of my homeland

ALI (CONTD)
(beat)
I am but an instrument of God a
messenger of his will In my hand
he has placed the Sword of Islam
and commanded me

He stares into the frozen faces paralyzed in fear
He relaxes smiles slightly

ALT
But you have nothing to fear Gods
mercy is bestowed upon the innocent
and the righteous

With a last look he turns and moves down the aisle

INT FORWARD GALLEY AREA - DAY 62

Fran Nancy and two other attendants sit in their jump
seats Fran warily eyes the terrorist as he passes by
the others averting him altogether Fran turns to Nancy
sitting next to her obviously still deeply shaken by the
murders she witnessed earlier

FRAN
(whispering)
Judys been down there for four
hours They wouldnt have left
her there alone Somethings
wrong

NANCY
(whispering terrified)
Oh God Fran be quiet Theyre
crazy

Sensing someones presence Nancy looks up the words
freezing in her throat as she looks into Alis face

ALI HASSAN
You will bring food for my men
Now

Nancy frozen with panic closes her eyes unable to
move or speak Ali leans in closer

ALT
I said bring food for my men

But then Ali looks up seeing the empty clipboard that
once held the passenger manifest

62

He removes the clipboard studying it Frans eyes
momentarily going to the trash bin where she hid the
manifest

ALT
(to Nancy)
The passenger manifest Where is
it

Startled Nancy looks up She has no idea where it is
Ali leans in closer his face inches from Nancy now
trembling in fear

ALI
(menacing)
I will not ask you again Where
is the manifest

Frans voince breaks the tension

FRAN (0S)
I destroyed it

Ali stands back scrutinizing Fran

ALT
(bemused )
Destroyed How

FRAN
The toilet

ALT
I see And why

Fran hesitates a moment

FRAN
To protect the passengers

ALT
(smiles)
To protect the Jews

He moves closer scrutinizing her his eyes deeply
penetrating hers

ALI
(quietly)
Or someone else

Fran is terrified out of her wits but holds her ground
Slowly Ali backs away eyes still probing her for the
slightest betrayal 62

ALT
Brave but a very stupid foolish
thing to do
(stares at her)
And totally unnecessary

He replaces the clipboard He gestures to Fran

ALT
You will bring food for my men

FRAN
(calmly)
What about the passengers Theyve
had nothing to eat or drink

ALI HASSAN

(smiles)
No food only drink

(beat)
And they may use the rear bathrooms
accompanied by a guard Any
suspicious movement they will be
shot

(beat)
See I am a generous man You are
free to move about the cabin But
no more mistakes Understood

FRAN
(softly)
Yes Thank you Ill have to use
the elevator

Carefully she turns and opens the elevator door As she
steps inside Ali stops her motioning for one of the
terrorist guards to accompany her

ALI
No more mistakes

INT 747 LOWER GALLEY - DAY 63

The elevator door opens and Fran emerges followed by
the guard Immediately her eyes go to the limp form
of Judy lying against the food carts She starts to
move to her side but the guard stops her with the
barrel of his weapon Slowly she pushes it aside

FRAN
(quietly weeping)
Do what you want Im going to
cover her body

63

She turns away from him taking a blanket from an
overhead storage compartment She kneels a last look at
her friend before covering the body As she stands and
turns toward the food carts we see that her eyes filled
with tears also blaze with anger and hatred

INT DELIVERY PLANE —- DAY 64

Rat attaches a pressure valve to a small stainless steel
cylinder labeled GAS AGENT SODIUM CHLORAL-HYDRATE
He re-locks the valve replacing the cylinder into a
circular foam-filled nylon carrying case

Beside him Charlie opens an aluminum case marked with
a wide red stripe Enmeshed in foam is an array of
highly specialized weapons a four-shot high-powered
taser unit equipped with Teflon barbs lethal-looking
hand shotguns mounted on heavy pistol grips a short-
barreled impact cannon with several rubber-tipped shells

Cahill studying the team turns to Travis eyeing the
-22 Beretta automatic strapped to his chest

CAHILL
Why all the guns

TRAVIS
Hope for the best plan for the
worst Cahill

RAT
Dont sweat it theyre all
high-impact close-quarter
weapons

A warning light flashes on announced by a BUZZER The
pilots voice is heard

PILOT (V0O)

The men quickly stow their equipment putting on their
closed-circuit communications units consisting of
headsets and microphones Cahill nervously motions to
Travis and Grant to approach the cockpit

CAHILL
Once the tunnel is pressurized
Ill open the hatch to the 747
When youre inside Ill go back
up and lock it

64 64

Travis interrupts

TRAVIS
As soon as the hatch to the 747 is
open an alarm will activate in the
cockpit We have to lock off that
switch within seconds or run the
risk of being discovered Just
explain the procedure to Baker

CAHILL
(adamant )

You dont understand Opening the
final hatch is complicated every
phase critical I cant just tell
someone how to do it Unless I

can ascertain that the seal is at
the proper vacuum you may not have
any mission left to accomplish

Travis considers this Grant carefully studying him

TRAVIS
Okay Cahill You make your
inspection and open the hatches
But Baker is going to be right
there behind you As soon as the
747 is open you haul ass inside
so Baker can lock off that switch

CAHILL
But

TRAVIS
Then when were on board you can
climb back down and close the
hatch

Cahill is obviously not pleased with the idea of going on
board the 747 even for a few minutes but Travis has the
final word

CAHILL

(hesitant)
All right but while the pressure
locks are open both planes are
vulnerable to explosive
decompression Move fast This
was designed to be carried out
with both planes on automatic

delivery plane approaches from the rear

The CO-PILOT pulls down a transparent screen covering
the mid-section of the windshield He activates an
infra-red viewing field revealing the wind-foil patterns
flowing over the wings and along the body of the 747
leaving streaming contrails in its wake the engines
glowing red-black

CAHILL
An infra-red imaging device The
air flow of heated molecular
particles surrounding the plane

Suddenly the plane pitches and rocks encountering a
pattern of turbulence as they enter the wake of the 747
Moments later as if through parting clouds we see a
channel appear a clear spot underneath the belly of the
plane

CAHILL
There the sweet-spot A valley
of dead air like the eye of a
hurricane

They stare in awe as the tiny plane is slowly engulfed

by the huge mass of the 747 above it

The Terrorist hesitates staring at the pilot

INT COCKPIT - DELIVERY PLANE - DAY 70

Recovering from the turbulent air the PILOT begins yet
another approach The delivery plane eases toward the
belly of the 757 filling the windshield Suddenly the
747 drops the Pilot jerking hard on the yoke darting
the agile craft away from the plunging mass above them

PILOT
May have enough fuel for one more
pass We should break off find
the tanker and refuel Your call
Colonel but make it quick

Travis looks back at Baker who consults his tac-board
He shakes his head no Travis turns back to the Pilot

Why are we not climbing

He listens his face incensed at what he hears He slams
down the phone moving towards the front passengers
reacting with new alarm to the heavy buffeting the plane
is receiving at times

INT CABIN AREA - DELIVERY PLANE - DAY 78

Cahill quickly reads a series of gauges on the tower
indicating pressure lock at 5000 HG IN A HISS of AIR
as he throws a switch pressurizing the tunnel

CAHILL
Primary tunnel is pressurized and
stable Im going up

Travis motions to Baker who moves up behind Cahill
Baker holding a stainless steel clip in his hand

TRAVIS
(to Cahill)
As soon as that final hatch is
open get the hell out of the way

Cahill nods then cautiously releases the locking device
on the hatch He pushes it upward securing it exposing
the interior of the tunnel

INT DOCKING TUNNEL - DAY 79

Cahill climbs up the interior ladder At the top of the
tunnel is a second pressure hatch isolating the outside
collar and the skin of the 747 This section as well as
the hatch is made of clear plastic enabling Cahill to
physically examine the suction pumps outside

Cahill studies a series of pressure and vacuum gauges and
then using a flashlight inspects the suction pumps
verifying that there is a complete seal with the skin of
the 747

Just below him Baker clings to the ladder poised ready
to move

CAHILL
(tense)
Seal looks good Im equalizing
the outer chamber

Carefully he opens a bleed valve a HISS of AIR as the
final link is pressurized Cahill studies the gauges
consulting his watch Taking a deep breath he gently
opens the final hatch swinging it down into the chamber

CAHILL
Im opening the hatch

He opens the hatch revealing the belly of the 747 and
the avionics hatch surrounded by the heavy neoprene
vacuum-collar Cahill releases the locking device on
the 747 hatch lowering it into the tunnel Quickly
urged by Baker he scrambles up the ladder and inside
the 747 as Baker follows quickly placing the steel clip
over a switch closing it

But as Travis pulls the lower hatched closed the delivery
plane pulls free from the 747

Theres only one thing we can do
Take over the plane let them know
were in command and then land it
some place safe As planned

Let the Captain here have a
listen Could be a dozen of them
we dont know

RAT
Well worry about that after we
take the plane We cant spare
the time to look for it

GRANT
I dont think you can afford not
to

RAT

(irritated)
Lets get one thing straight
Captain Youre still along as
an advisor Stick with the
interpreting When I need your
opinion youll know it

GRANT
Its more complicated than chain
of command Finding that bomb
is just as important maybe more
than taking over this plane
Think about it

From his stretcher Cappy calls out

CAPPY

Hes right Got to know if
theres a bomb

(beat)
Could be a pressure switch timer
Try to land the plane change
altitude anything could set it

We ARRIVE at a container opened up like a soup can
baggage strewn everywhere Overhead lights illuminate
the open container as if it were the crater at Tycho in

thing in the container with his detector

CHARLIE
Almost missed it Reading was
less than one part in two million

Inside we see a dismantled wooden packing crate revealing
a three-tiered object at the bottom of which are two

rows of double-ended bottles two feet long six inches

in diameter stacked two deep a total of 12 bottles

The surface of the bottles is a shiny metallic material
like mirrored sunglasses Strapped to the canisters

with stainless steel bands is a black metal box two

feet high

RAT
Whatever it is its sittin on
enough Semtex to fuck up your
whole day

Using a hand-powered drill Rat carefully drills a tiny
hole into the case He attaches a fiber-optic probe
peering through the eyepiece He looks up

most probably Jean-Paul Demou
Thats a recent photograph Hes
French nuclear engineer once
assigned to a reactor plant in

Baker attaches a second eyepiece to the unit holding
one to Cappys eye as he squeezes the trigger Grant
observes the interior along with Cappy

CAPPYS POV - INT BOMB

In the eerie illumination of the probe is revealed a
forest of printed circuit boards and in one section a
rotating laser-disc-like mechanism connected through a
series of relays and wires to a thick floor of dark
orange material at the base of the computer sitting
directly atop the nerve gas

be running a dozen programs
Cappy now sees the guts of the bomb the lens moving
around showing the relays and probes pressed into the
plastic explosive at the base

removed the eyepiece exposing the tiny viewscreen inside

attached to the probe above

RAT
Ran the cable down the back side
of the elevator shaft Theyll
never see it

Baker takes the cable twisting the wires into those
leading from the camera He switches on the camera

On the tiny view screen of the camera we see the wide
angle black and white image of the main cable Random
static crosses the picture

Baker hands Grant a switch wired into the electrical
system of the plane

that a light on the telephone is flashing a code A
moment later Fran notices the light but stares at it
unmoving

Fran staring at the flashing light She looks around
seeing one of the Terrorist Guards standing nearby She
looks at the flashing light and then picks up the
phone

Disbelieving she turns eyes searching focusing on the
tiny probe barely visible in the bulkhead

GRANT

in direct control of it We have
to find him and we need your help
Youre looking for someone with
an electronic device a radio

Suddenly the phone is ripped from her hand Ali roughly
spinning her around

Ali places the phone to his ear and listens The line is
dead
FRAN
I thought the phone rang Im

sorry Its just habit
He stares at her and then hangs up the phone

Ali leaves Fran is overwhelmed by this new development
Suddenly she remembers the Air Marshal She looks back
down the aisle making eye contact with him She turns
back horrified She has to warn him but how

She looks around her focusing on a rack of magazines
We HOLD ON Frans face

magazines and turns towards them A moments hesitation
and then she looks up directly into the lens a look of
strength and determination on her face she nods Grant
turns to Baker

She reaches his seat casually handing him a magazine
What the quard cant see is her expression as she taps the
cover of the magazine The Marshal looks down seeing

A Newsweek a cover shot of a group of US soldiers in
camouflage weapons the banner-line reading HOW MUCH
LONGER

The Marshal looks up Fran looking hard at the picture
and then mouthing the words Theyre here

She moves on leaving the Marshal to stare at the picture
in bewilderment Theyre here

Fran continues to search for some sign of suspicious
behavior an electronic device something There seems
to be nothing but row upon row of frightened innocent-
looking passengers

INT FORWARD BAGGAGE COMPARTMENT - CLOSEUP - DAY 178
view of the bomb FOCUSES on a wiring harness of varying
colors The tiny pinpoint beam of a laser appears on

one of the wires

178

CAPPY
Low-power number one Just touch
the wire for a heartbeat

In Cahills hand is a laser-knife the size of a fountain
pen a wire leading to a power box on the floor beside
him Cahill touches the trigger and the beam changes
intensity the wire suddenly vaporizing leaving the bare
wire underneath exposed

CAPPY
Thats good Now clip in

Cahill wipes the sweat from his brow his shirt soaked in
perspiration At his side is a small black box taken
from the bomb kit At one end of the box are a series

of ports for electrical connections Several wires lead
from the ports to the bomb clipped in to wires in
various components

CAHILL
Here goes

With trembling hands he attaches another wire to a relay
in the bomb plugging the other end into the black box

CAPPY

Outstanding Youve got the major
sensors by-passed Mr X will
still think the bombs intact

(beat)
Kick the power up to three and cut
the wires to that first relay
Thats a load-fluctuator a fail-
safe against an electromagnetic
burst

Cahill turns up the power and begins to move the laser-
knife towards the bomb But his hand begins to tremble
uncontrollably He stops

CAHILL
(verge of panic
anger)
I cant do it My hands shaking
too much I cant breathe

CAPPY
Settle down Cahill Youre doing
fine You know anything about
fishing 178
CAHILL

No I hate fish Hate the

CAPPY

Doesnt matter Shut the fuck up

Close your eyes

Youre sitting at your desk
its in the middle of a pine
forest Wind cool and light the
sun shining down through the
trees Youre beside a stream
water rollin over the rocks into
the most beautiful pool of deep
green water youve ever seen

Cahills breathing slows his face beginning to relax
Cappy closes his eyes

CAPPY

walk to the pool your fly rod in
your hand royal coachman tied on
your cant miss fly At the back
of that pool is Bad Leroy Brown
fifteen pound German trout just
startin to rise from beneath a

to do is pull back float your

Leroys nose

Cahill opens his eyes His hand has stopped shaking He
moves forward cutting through the wires with the laser

He turns looking at Cappys face reflected in the
mirror Cappy nods closing his eyes in relief

strolling close behind

seen earlier The Woman is perspiring and seems short of
breath

WOMAN
Miss may I have some water I
have to take my medication
Diabetes

The Woman holds out a prescription pill vial

FRAN
(distracted)
Of course Ill get you some

water
The Woman fumbles with the vial her hands trembling

WOMAN
These things are always so hard
to open

The vial slips from her hands falling to the floor

FRAN
Ill get it

Fran kneels to the floor to help The Guard moves in
prodding her with his weapon

FRAN
(calmly)
Its all right Im just getting
her pills

Fran kneels searching the floor for the vial finding it
next to the Womans feet She is about to rise when her
eyes freeze on the underseat storage space of the window
seat where the Laptop Computer seen earlier sits
nearly obscured from view

Fran stares at the computer slowly looking up into the
alarmed eyes of the dark-complected man at the window

The Guard pulls Fran to her feet examining the pill vial
before giving it to the Woman

FRAN
Ill be right back with your
water

The man at the window follows their movement and then
carefully removes the computer hiding it between his
body and the window bulkhead

work of the bomb

Knowing how this fucker thinks I
expect hes got a surprise for us
Check under the panel with your

connecting the two panels a trip-
wire maybe

Holding the panel steady Cahill lowers his head using
the light on his head gear to scan between the two levels
the second level consisting of a series of relays and a
softball-sized stainless steel sphere He scans the area
seeing a hair-fine wire attached to the top panel and
below to a micro-switch

Youre right Theres a wire
hooked to a switch

Cahill unfolds a small tripod supporting a shaft with a
suction cup at one end He places the tripod over the

CAPPY
Now back off just a hair Just
enough to see if its friendly

Cahill swallows hard takes a deep breath and turns the
reverse-screw mechanism at the top of the tripod lifting
the cover a fraction of an inch He stops using a tiny
penlight and a dentists mirror to examine the edges and
the back side of the plate

Cant see anything

Okay back it off a little more

Cahill slowly removes the cover revealing the interior
of the hollow sphere at the bottom of which is a tiny
brass armature situated above a steel contact point
similar to that in an automobile distributor

CAPPY
Dont touch anything Let me see
those points

Cahill adjusts the mirror holding a magnifying glass
over the sphere focusing it for Cappy

CAPPY
Looks clear Dont think Mr X
expected us to get this far But
you need something thin and non-
metallic to slip between those
points

Cahill searches through the kit but cant find anything
plastic He reaches into his pocket pulling out a
handful of cocktail napkins paper etc He finds a
plastic coffee straw Slitting the straw with a knife he
holds it out ready to insert it between the points

Cahill turns back to the sphere with the plastic strip
taking a deep breath But suddenly he stops Cahill
looks up at Cappy in the mirror

if he did expect us to get this
far Why quit now

The door opens and the Terrorist emerges Seeing Fran
sitting across from him he raises his weapon to fire

A voice from behind calls out

Startled the Terrorist turns facing Grant aiming a 22
silenced pistol at him The Terrorist starts to move and
Grant FIRES TWICE two tiny red holes appearing in the
Terrorists head He falls to the floor in a heap Grant
is stunned momentarily overcome by what he has just done
Fran stares back at him realizing this is not a cold-
blooded killer He looks at her as if asking for help

and then kneels stripping the Terrorist of his clothes
He looks at Fran

GRANT
The man in 148 were going to
stop him

FRAN

What do you want me to do

He stares at her fear in his eyes
GRANT

Help me get close enough to kill

ing the 747s position relative to the US coast-line
the F-14s tracking the jet and a flashing fail-safe
line indicating that the 747 has already crossed the
point where it was determined it must be destroyed The
elapsed time clock indicates six minutes remaining on the
additional ten minutes

Theyll be starting their descent
in about ten minutes

DCI

At thirty-five thousand feet our
loses would be minimal Every
thousand feet of descent the
death toll from fallout will
increase dramatically

I pray youve made the right
decision

Kaplan continues to stare at the situation map

As he does we PAN DOWN TO the table to the open folder

We SLOWLY PUSH IN ON a photograph of a man early fifties

Grant emerges from the elevator pushing Fran as if she
were his prisoner Holding the automatic weapon in his
left hand as a shield across his face we see that in
his right hand he is holding the 22 Beretta flat
against her back

GRANT
(whisper)
Just keep walking Eyes straight
ahead When I push you hit the
floor and stay down

Fran moves forward her face frozen with fear They
enter the aisle moving towards the man at the window
his head barely visible some ten rows away On the

other side of the cabin the Terrorist Guard sees them
but as he can only view Grant from the rear he continues
on his patrol

Grant focuses his attention on the man now seven rows
away But he fails to see the Terrorist on patrol in

paralyzed face of the man in 148-B Grants finger
touches the trigger and then stops

Grant stares at the man seeing him for the first time
focusing on his eyes the trembling lip and the unmistak-
able fear and utter confusion of an innocent man

Grant spins back to the aisle meeting Frans stunned
expression

GRANT
Its not him

Grant reaches across the seats grabbing the computer
yanking it towards him As he does the computer smashes
into the seat back the battery pack splitting open a
flood of glittering diamonds cascading over Grants leg

EXPLODING into the headrest Grant plants his foot on
an armrest and in a wild crawling scramble across the

On the floor the sleeper with trembling hands flips
open the lid to a six-inch square calculator-like device
