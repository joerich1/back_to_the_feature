theater work in San Francisco and San Diego
for as long as youve been doing stag
and hardcore Jack
JACK
I know youre history Floyd
COLONEL
No ones doubting your history
or your credentials Floyd
FLOYD
Then why the resistance I mean
This industry is going to be turned
upside down soon enough --
JACK
Then why help it
FLOYD
Why not be prepared The money comes
from the Colonel the talent comes from
you Jack Ive got a connection to the
equipment and the mail order distribution
not to mention those kids I got out there
who are hot-fuck-action to the max
This is the future Video tape tells the truth

JACK
I have a stable of actors and actresses
Theyre professionals Theyre not
a bunch of fucking amateurs Theyre
proven box office and they get people
in theaters (where films should be seen)
and they know how to fuck well --
FLOYD
Thats right Jack and by that
same token youre the one with the
power here The video revolution
is upon us -- and our role is critical
We have an obligation to use our resources
and talent to help make it fly --
JACK

You come in here at my party tell me about

this and that -- tell me about the future
tell me about -- video and amateurs and
all that -- well lemme tell you something now

I will not shoot films on video and no
I will not loan out my actors who are
under contract to me Period
FLOYD
Wait a minute Jack Im not a complicated man
I like cinema In particular I like to
see fucking on film I dont want to win

an Oscar and I dont want to re-invent the
wheel -- I enjoy simple pleasures like butter
in my ass and lollipops in my mouth
Thats me -- call me crazy call me a pervert
but this is something I enjoy One other
small thing I want to do in this life is make
a dollar and a cent in this business -- Im not
trying to hurt you Im trying to help you stay
one step ahead of the game --
JACK
Were repeating ourselves now Floyd
COLONEL
Jack I think this is about cost and future --
JACK
The future is as bright as we make it --
it shouldnt be sacrificed for a few dollars
that can be saved shooting on video tape --
if it looks like shit and sounds like shit
it probably is shit --
FLOYD
I think youre one gin past this conversation --
JACK
No no Im crystal clear here
COLONEL
Jack please understand that this is
not an argument this is a fact of --

JACK
What
COLONEL
This is not an argument but a --
JACK
What are you saying
COLONEL
What do you mean Jack cmon --
JACK
Are you telling me that youre
working with this shit
COLONEL
I think that there is a serious case
to be made for the price and the gamble
on the whole idea of a home video market --
Jack Two three years from now everyones
gonna be able to walk into their local
supermarket and buy or rent a videocassette --
JACK
True film fans wont watch that shit

It doesnt look good and more importantly
it doesnt make sex look sexy
COLONEL
It doesnt have to look good Jack
Film is just too damn expensive

The theaters are already planning

converting to video projectors
