Good thing about getting old is not to be surprised often
Sophisticated curse youve got havent you

Its gonna be really hard to dispel it

Fire is talking
And you cant tell it to other people

You are Howl

No Im an evil spirit Calucifer

Then Calucifer Can you dispel the curse on me

Yeah Thats pretty easy Ill dispel the curse on you right away if you
let me be free

That means I make a deal with an evil doesnt it Are you sure that you can
keep such a promise like this

You see Im an evil I never keep promises
Find someone else then

Are you gonna abandon such a pity evil like me with no mercy Ive been
bound by Howls magic

So I have no freedom Look at this castle I am the one who is running this
castle See

Please stay with me Sophie

Do you want to drink milk

Witch in Waste Land is looking for this castle

Really I saw her follower at the harbor

Im actually a coward

These interiors are all amulets Ive been scared every second
Why on earth have you been targeted by Witch in Waste Land
She was totally evil-minded

Im the one who had contact with her because I found her interesting
And then I ran away

And this time I was summoned by the king

Also Jenkins and Pen dragon were

How many names do you have Howl

Several names enough to live my life of freedom I see
You have no choice but to obey the kings order
Look
I had to have a contract with the king when I entered the school of magic
So Howl why dont you go and see the king then
Say to him I dont want to help you with this stupid war

Sophie you can say it easily because you dont know what kind of people they
are

Hes the king isnt he Hes supposed to care about his people isnt he
Thats right Sophie you can go to see the king What do you mean
You go as Pen dragons mom

And say My son is coward and useless

If you say so Madam Saliman might give up

Madam Saliman

After all your work to clean my cloths

Do you still wear that hat

Im off See you guys later

See you later

Good luck Sophie Itll protects you from Witch in Waste Land
Youre gonna be fine Im coming with you by transforming into something
Good luck

I doubt if its gonna work

Hes supposed to protect me I hope that crow isnt him

I think Howl transformed into something identical

I hope hes not that one

Still long way to go to get to the palace

Howl are you Howl

You are mean You didnt need to become an OLD dog

You dont know how stressful and tiring it is to be an OLD lady

Hello again Arent you the shop keeper of the hat shop
Isnt she Witch in Waste Land
Thank you for handing the letter to Howl
How is he doing

He was trembling in fear Im working for him as a cleaning lady by the
way

Its good for you
But why do you need to go to the palace

Im asking the government for job Im fed up with being Howls cleaning
lady

How about you What are you doing here

Im going to see the king

it finally seems that Saliman that idiot cant do it without me anymore
Im not interested in that topic But dispel this curse you put on me

Unfortunately no I can spell the curse on but I cant dispel it
Farewell

Ciao

Wait you cant go Wait

I would have gone up to her and hit her if you hadnt been like that
Whats going on What happened to you guys

Madam magic is forbidden from here on

You can only walk

Is that you Saliman Do you want ME to go up stairs on foot
Im catching up You can t stare at her like that

Oh my I hate this Why are you so heavy

Hey You Why dont you wait for me

What do you want Did you remember how to dispel my curse

I said I forgot I cant dispel

Youd better study hard

I dont understand Why is she still that vital

Let me have a small break
Hey you Youd better give up today Its impossible for you to climb all
the way to the top

Since I was kicked out of the palace
years ago

I had been waiting for this chance

Do whatever you want then unfortunately I cant be kind to you to take your
hand

Come on Howl

How cold-hearted are you Ill turn you into even OLDER women next time
Come on Hurry Quick quick

Hello Madam This way please

But I think you should help that lady down there first

We are not allowed to take anyones hand Im afraid Madam
How cruel Didnt the king summon us to the palace

Hey you Keep up You can do it

Youre nearly there

Dont you have more stamina

Shut up

You look terribly and older in such a short period

Mrs Pen dragon and Witch in Waste Land

Are you OK You wanted to come here didnt you

Mrs Pen dragon and Witch in Waste Land

Pen dragon Ive heard of that name before

Of course you do This is the name of the hat shop I was working for
I doubt it

Wait here please

Howl come over here

Come this way please Madam

You are Howls mother

My name is Pen dragon your highness
Youre tired arent you You may sit there

Thank you

How do you do My name is Saliman a royal sorcerer
Ah your highness That dog is

This dog His name is Hean my lovely

I asked him to guide you all the way here

So you want to say Howl is not coming is he

Howl my son is such a coward and a incapable wizard
Your highness I dont think he can help the king

Im disappointed Oh

Howl was my last apprentice

He used to be incredibly talented

I even thought about giving him my position soon

I was so pleased of it

however his heart was stolen by evil and then he left right after
He began to use magic for his own purpose

Howls mother Yes

He is too dangerous hes got too much power but he doesnt have enough
strength in is heart to control it

Im afraid hes going to be like Witch in Waste Land if you dont do
anything for him

Bring her here

Hey you Are you OK

Shes all right I brought her back to her real age
She has no magic power anymore

She also used to be very talented in magic

Since she made deals with evils gradually her body and soul had been eaten
up

Now the kingdom is not going to allow those back-alley wizards and witches
to live unchecked
Im going to tell him how to end his deal with evils

if you bring him here and he promises hell be devoted to the king
If he doesnt come Ill take away all his power

Like that poor lady

Your highness

Now I see why Howl didnt want to come here

Somethings wrong here

You let old ladies like us climb up such a long stair without any help even
though you summoned us

And you led us to a strange room like that Its like a trap
Howl has no heart

You are right in a way that hes coward and selfish and sometimes I cant
see what hes thinking

But he is honest He just wants to live with freedom Hes not coming
Hes not going to be evil

And he can handle his relationship by himself

I believe so

Howls mother you are in love with him arent you
Howl Howls coming

I want to eat his heart I want it

You why dont you just give up Howls not coming
Yes he is

I found his weak point

Your Majesty You should still stay in bed Saliman
Do you feel better

I feel well today Your Majesty I got bored with meetings so I took a walk
in the sky for a while

Good for you Your Majesty Who are those ladies
She is mother of the wizard Howl

Im glad to see youI pretty appreciate Salimans effort but I dont think I
will use magic in battle
In fact enemys bombs never reach this palace because of Salimans magic
power

Instead they do it to surrounding towns Im afraid

Thats the way it is Dont you think Saliman

Absolutely You are very philosophical today Your Majesty
There you are Saliman

Finally were getting into the final battle

We must beat them completely in this Saliman this time you made such a
brilliant double Ill come back with good news

Im looking forward to hearing it Your Majesty

All generals are ready Yes

Its been a while Howl

Im so glad to see you again Master

I knew it was you

I didnt break the promise

Thats because

I dont want to fight against you Master

Im going home with my mother

I wont let you go

Dont look at the ground She is extremely powerful
Show your mother your real identity

Howl no

Hang on tight

Sophie move to the front

After all you brought everybody with you didnt you
doggy

You are on Salimans side arent you

I want you to get you off somewhere You cant fly can you

Sophie you drive
Are you kidding Thats insane
They are catching up Already

Ill take care of them Sophie you keep flying to the castle in Waste Land
OK

Are you serious Ive never even driven a car

Did you forget you are wearing the ring It will guide you to the castle
Call Calucifer in your hand

Call Calucifer

It worked

Head to the direction the light is pointing at Thats it I suppose youll
get there by the evening

I think I didnt need to go to the palace because you came after all
I did because you were there Sophie

I couldnt have been there if I had been without you

You saved me

It was really close I tell you

Dont release the wheel suddenly

You drive very well No way

Wow you threw them away a bit

Ill make them blind for five seconds so that you can go further
Howl

No thanks

Thanks It was really an exciting moment

Howl believes he escaped successfully but he didnt

He has a very young mother doesnt he by the way

Dont expect me to be friendly with you

Besides I still dont trust you You know that

The castle is there Its welcoming us

Over here Sophie

Marker I have a little problem Where is the brake
Sophie

Doggy

Im successfully home Marker

Are you OK Sophie

Im was very worried about you
Thank you for catching us

Thats no good You did too much

Was it Howl Did he come back

Howl

Howl Are you OK Howl

You got injured didnt you does it hurt
Dont come

I came to help you I want to set you free from the curse put on you

You should dispel your own curse first And why do you try to do this for
monster like me

Because Im in love with you
Its too late

Howl

Howl did come back didnt he

Sophie I want to set the curse between Howl and me free Dont you still
know the secret between us yet

Our time is ticking to the end

Howl is turning into a demon isnt he

Is that right

I cant tell you the truth - Because Im an evil You know that

Listen Calucifer Saliman told me Howl gave you something very important
for him

What and where is it
I cant speak about the secret of the contract

Or Ill give you water
Didnt you hear If I die Howl dies too

Good morning turnip head Are you allright

Good thing about being old is to have fewer things to lose
