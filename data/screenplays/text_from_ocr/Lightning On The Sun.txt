EXT TRIBECA STREET - NIGHT

The CAMERA pans up the elegant facade of a pre-war building
to the fifth floor at the top The huge street-side windows
are completely fogged up

SUPER NEW YORK 1992 ELECTION NIGHT
INT LOFT - NIGHT

The cavernous loft is wall to wall with prototypical Gen-
Xers Everyones eyes are glued to a color TV thats been set
up on a battered Pool table The air’ is thick with tension
and pot smoke

ANGLE ON TV screen PETER JENNINGS looks into the camera

PETER JENNINGS
With more than a third of the vote
counted ABC news is now
projecting that William Jefferson
Clinton has been elected the 42nd
president of the United States

The loft explodes into a jubilant and clamorous celebration

ANGLE ON JULIE late-twenties a dazzling beauty ina
brazen red dress

She deftly fends off a schlubby guy trying to land a victory
kiss She notices a lone male figure still standing directly
in front of the TV

ANGLE ON ASHER late-twenties An innocent and open
expression on his boyishly handsome face Hes mesmerized by
an image on the screen

ANGLE ON A 16 year-old Bill Clinton wearing his Scout
uniform shakes hands with President Kennedy

The network cuts away to a crowd of boomers getting down to
Fleetwood Mac Asher snaps out of his reverie He glances
about the party unconsciously mouthing the words to Dont
Stop Hes struck dumb mid-chorus

ANGLE ON Julie unabashedly scrutinizing him from across
the loft ‘

She smiles at him She knows his secret

The next instant she vanishes back into the frenzied
celebration

ANGLE ON Asher The boy is smitten

LATER ON
The place is stupid with rich-kid dilettantes and poseurs
expounding on art and politics The old-fashioned radiators
are going full bore creating a sauna effect Everyone is
sweating No one cares

ANGLE ON PETER late twenties the overbearing host of the
party holding court behind his deejay station He slings his
arm around Asher toasts him with a bottle of Jim Beam

PETER PRIVELEGE
(pronounced lisp)
Tve seen the devil of violence
and the devil of Fuck

Peter cues a record

PETER PRIVELEGE
To the heart of darkness To Asher

“HOLIDAY IN CAMBODIA blares over the speakers

Everyones about to drink up when Julie appears at the
groups periphery

She lifts her plastic wine glass to Asher He raises his
cocktail

ASHER
Cheers

JULIE
Cheers Big ears

Peter notes their little exchange He scurries out from
behind the turntables and whisks Julie away

ANGLE ON a row of five paintings hanging on the scuffed
wall Theyre tracings of headstones colored in red

The cage door to the industrial elevator opens and more
revelers come pouring in to the packed loft

INT BATHROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

A cramped lavatory The walls are papered with aluminum foil
Discarded cocktails line the sink An ADDLED CHICK appraises
herself in the mirror Satisfied she exits

Asher enters Someone squeezes in behind him latching the
door shut Asher spins around to protest and comes face to
exquisite-face with Julie They stand there wordlessly for a
charged moment barely a tongues length apart

A wicked grin curls Julies red lips Just as Asher leans
toward her the door bursts open and the former occupant
barges in -- directly between them
ADDLED CHICK
I lost my lude Quaalude where are
you

She drops to her knees and starts frantically searching
around on the the floor

JULIE
Find me

She promptly exits Asher awkwardly attempts to step over the
Addled Chick He fails and comes crashing down in a-heap He
pulls himself up by the sink and scrambles out the door

INT LOFT - CONTINUOUS

The first chords of David Bowies ASHES TO ASHES sound

ANGLE ON a determined Asher as he fights his way through
the crowd searching for Julie

ANGLE ON Peter He has a bitter-shit look on his face as
he observes Asher

INT PETERS BEDROOM - LATE

Peters bedroom has been designated the coat depository A
mountain of trendy outerwear has been piled up on the bed

Asher enters Theres no sign of Julie He checks the closet
Hes about to leave when he hears a muffled giggle He walks
over to the bed and gently tugs one of the coats off The
giggling grows’ louder

INT LOFT - INTERCUT

Peter walks from painting to painting gashing each with a
stiletto

INT BEDROOM - LATE
The room is wrecked Coats scattered everywhere

In the course of a raucous and passionate romp Asher and
Julie have landed on the floor beside the bed

ASHER
Whats your name

She manages to roll him over so that shes on top

ASHER
Tell me your name

He traces her lips with his fingers
JULIE
Julie

FADE TO BLACK
ASHES TO ASHES peters out
SUPER There were so many things he would never be now
EXT NATIONAL MUSEUM GARDEN - LATE AFTERNOON
SUPER THE PRESENT CAMBODIA 1997

A lush garden courtyard surrounding the majestic rust-colored
pavilion that serves as the National Museum Theres a murky
dreamlike quality to it all as the tropical flower colors
bleed into one another We can make out a blurry figure
sweeping the pathways

The figure comes into focus with each stroke of the broom and
we see that its a beautiful Khmer woman She wears a tight
baby-blue dress with a slit in the back and white buttons
down the front that accentuate her bosom

ASHER (0S)
Fuck

ANGLE ON Her twin reflections in the binocular lenses
EXT ASHERS APARTMENT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Asher jerks the binoculars down and wipes the perspiration
from his eyes Five hard years have drained the boyishness
from his face He sits rigid on a rickety metal chair

Asher plucks a roach from a club ashtray on the balconys
rail and fumblingly tries to fire up with his Zippo He
fails hurls the lighter against the wall and stalks into the
apartment

He re-emerges moments later with a steaming cold bottle of
Stolis and a cafeteria milk glass He plops back down into
his chair pours himself a precise measure of vodka and
resumes his vigil

ANGLE ON the gardenAbsolute serenity untilFrom under
the pavilions roof a great squealing cloud comes pouring out
like black ink Bats

ASHER
(smiling)
Cheers big ears

He drains the vodka and pours himself another which he gulps
down like water He pops the roach into his mouth and lights
up as he goes back inside
INT ASHERS APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
We follow Asher through his one-room hovel of a flat

The floor is littered with piles of dirty clothes
overflowing ashtrays and empty bottles The bookshelves are
crammed with paperbacks and stacks of newspapers

Asher pulls on a pair of jeans He strips off his clammy
t-shirt and replaces it with a gray button-down

He crosses over to the kitchen area and opens the freezer He
retrieves a plastic hotel bucket digs into the brownish ice
and pulls out a sandwich bag containing a thick wad of
American bills

He pulls a worn leather satchel out from underneath the bed
places it on the mattress He unfurls the roll of bills and
with great precision tucks them under the satchels liner
He shoves a Paris Review and some dirty clothes inside and
rebuckles it

He slings the satchel over his shoulder and exits

ANGLE ON a crate beside the bed serving as a night stand
Propped up against a four-headed Buddha statue is an old
photograph of Julie

EXT STREET - LATE AFTERNOON

Asher pushes his Honda Dream motorcycle out of the garage A
group of street kids descend upon him

CHILDREN
Asher Asher

One kid tries to scramble on board for a ride Asher gently
detaches him as he rolls away kick-starting the bike as he
goes The kids chase after him down the street

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - LATER THAT EVENING

An official-looking police roadblock has been thrown up under
the guise of checking papers

Asher looks around wildly for a turn-off but a truck has
boxed him in on the right Hes funneled inevitably towards
the flashing red lights

Theres one car ahead It passes through Ashers up He
withdraws an ID card from his wallet

ASHER
Here you go sir

One COP checks the ID while the other blinds Asher with a
flashlight
ANGLE ON an old photo of Ashers smiling face on a United
Nations ID

Cop 1 shows it to Cop 2 whos shining the flashlight in
Ashers face He looks at Asher and shakes his head

Cop 1 directs Asher toward the fat SUPERIOR sitting on a
lawn chair off to the side of the road block Asher switches
off his bike and dismounts

ASHER
(mutters)
Theres always a fat man

Cop 1 hands Ashers card to the superior who glances at the
card and hands it back

ASHER
Thank you sir

Asher starts back toward his motorcycle The superior says
something in Khmer which prompts Cop 2 to step in front of
Asher Asher turns back to the superior

ASHER
Sir

The superior indicates Ashers satchel Asher slips off the
shoulder strap and coolly tosses it over The superior
rummages through it

Asher pulls out a pack of Marlboros while he waits and offers
smokes all around The cops accept

ANGLE ON A PROSTITUTE with her john in tow has hipped
her way to the head of the line She makes a lewd overture
towards Asher -- which he playfully acknowledges for the
cops amusement

The superior satisfied theres nothing of value in the bag
abruptly two-hand heaves it back toward Asher--who in the
midst of his mock-flirtation doesnt see the bag flying
towards him

ANGLE ON the satchel as it hits the road The seams on the
bottom bust open and the meticulously stashed green bills
tumble out onto the pavement

Asher stares at the bag in dumbfounded disbelief

ASHER
Fuck

CUT TO
INT POCHENTONG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY
SUPER THREE MONTHS EARLIER

ANGLE ON VIBOL THOM a diminutive bejeweled Cambodian
gangster with alligator loafers Hes unleashing a barrage of
spit-drenched Khmer into the face of a high-ranking ROYAL AIR
CAMBODIA official

VIBOL THOM
(subtitled)
My luggage didnt make the flight
If I owned this airline I would
have one employee shot in the head
each hour until my bag arrived

Vibol Thom is flanked by his lickspittle RIGHT HAND MAN
RHM attempts to cajole his boss and defuse the situation

Thoms fury appears to have subsided He abruptly steps away
from the quivering airline official who exhales in relief
Its short-lived relief however as Thom grabs a pistol from
his goons holster and spins back around to BITCH SLAP the
official with it

ANGLE ON a travel-weary HARRISON REESE mid-thirties Hes
clad in khakis a sweat-stained button-down shirt and in
spite of the heat a blue blazer He has a pink Financial
Times rolled up under one arm

Hes been pulled aside by the Cambodian Customs officials
They have no interest in his luggage his Nikon camera or
numerous recording devices Instead theyre fascinated by his
over-sized Yonex tennis racquet

He turns to the sound of someone ranting in Khmer just in
time to have Vibol Thom knock into him hard The pink
newspaper flies from Reeses grasp

ANGLE ON the paper as it lands and is immediately trampled
by RHM scurrying after his boss

Thom marches upstream against the flow of travelers as the
armed airport security guards make no move to stop him

EXT POCHENTONG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - CONTINUOUS

Thom strides out onto the tarmac where a ROYAL AIR CAMBODIA
plane sits

A pleading RHM makes the fatal mistake of tugging on one
of Thoms silk sleeves Thom whirls around on him with the
raised gun A cowering RHM holds up his hands to shield
himself BANG

ANGLE ON three fingers of RHMs left hand being blown
off
A shocked RHM crumples to his knees Thom marches under
the wing takes careful aim and empties an entire clip into
the tire

The tire abruptly gives way and the wing drops cracking Thom
on the head Furious he hurls his empty pistol at the plane
and stalks away

A shiny black Land Cruiser drives onto the tarmac and whisks
Thom and his freshly maimed henchman away

ANGLE ON Two frightened flight attendants peek out the
door of the lopsided plane The final shot of this impromptu
Keystone Cops homage

INT POCHENTONG INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - MOMENTS LATER

ANGLE ON Reese with a sheepish expression on his face
has not advanced an inch since we left him

The customs officers have gone from examining his racquet
with awe to practicing the finer points of their ground
strokes

ANGLE ON a sign WELCOME TO CAMBODIA MR REESE

Its being held aloft by PIN a Khmer teenager in a black
Metallica t-shirt and camouflage military pants He stands by
the airports long entrance-way with the other drivers
waiting for their passengers to emerge from customs

CUT TO
INT ASPARA - NIGHT

The dimly lit lounge of the massage parlor has a seedy Third
World Vegas feel to it

ANGLE ON Asher his battered face revealing that he did
not part easily with his money

He cases the joint from his spot next to the front door His
eyes adjust to the artificial light and he spies

ANGLE ON a mangled left hand delicately placing a lit
Benson and Hedges between the smirking lips of Vibol Thoms
mouth

PULL BACK to reveal the gangster buried in a leatherette
love seat with RHM hovering just behind him Two armed
goons lounge expansively on an adjacent couch

Across a checkerboard from Thom sits the Asparas owner MR
HAWK a portly man with an affable Buhdda-like face He
studies the board nervously pretending to be completely
befuddled by Thoms strategic genius
Asher looks away before the gangsters spot him He makes his
way across the bar then stops directly in front of the
camera He considers for a moment

ASHER
(muffled)
Thirty-four

No response Asher leans forward and knocks on the Plexiglas
wall that separates him from the camera

ASHER
Thirty-four Youre my lucky
number tonight You have to be
ANGLE ON The numbered ladies of the establishment

huddled together in a Plexiglas box Number thirty-four looks
up and smiles

keyboard

ASHER (0S)
I dont know how she found me

ANGLE ON The screen His e-mail page ASHERUNORG comes
up The cursor scrolls down numerous debt notices It comes
to an abrupt halt on an e-mail from JULIE G-Spot

ASHER (0S)

ANGLE ON The black computer screen as Julies simple
message flickers on SAVE ME ASHER We glimpse Julies
ghostly reflection in the screen
The soft sound of Asher moaning

INT ASPARA MASSAGE ROOM - NIGHT

ANGLE ON Asher lying on his back as if in the midst of a
painful dream His eyes pop open wide with a grunt

Number Thirty-Four stands over him in the cramped windowless
room vigorously working him to climax with her hand
LVUe

INT ASPARA - LATER THAT NIGHT

Mr Hawk sits behind the bar concentrating on the checker
board He plays both sides with a deftness and skill he
didnt dare reveal in Vibol Thoms presence Someone casts a
shadow over the board Mr Hawk looks up

MR HAWK
(cheerily)
Mr Asher You look lost

Mr Hawk gets Asher an Angkor beer then disappears behind the
bar He reemerges moments later with the money and counts out
three stacks He wraps them neatly in a Cambodian newspaper
then secures them with rubber bands and places them in a
white plastic LUCKY MARKET bag

MR HAWK

ASHER
Too steep How about ten a month
MR HAWK
Ten percent a week Now you must

ASHER

ASHER

BRIT-ARISTO VOICE (05S)
I like Vietnamese pussy

MR HAWK
This is the world

Asher smiles and flips back the last of his beer

ANGLE ON GERALD COATS (aka LORD YUM-YUM) a dissolute Brit
aristo with a jaundiced pallor and an expensive suit Hes
perched in a chair studying the girls inside the cage as if
they were items on a dessert menu

GERALD COATS
I fancy the taste of it
Salty like the Delta from which it
sprang

MR HAWK
(calls over)
New sisters from Samlot Mr
Coats The youngest -- two
soldiers past her virginity --
still a lullaby

Gerald Coats sucks on his index finger then taps on the
Plexiglas to get the youngest girls attention She smiles at
him lasciviously We see Asher passing in the background

GERALD COATS
Virginity Mr Hawk is overrated

ASHER

just an elaborate way of dropping

ASHER
Of what

JULIE
New York Because you dont have
the balls to hack it here

ASHER

Asher kicks a nearby headstone in frustration slabs come
flying off

It falls apart as soon as he withdraws his hands Julie
cracks up

ASHER
Fuck Peter Privilege and fuck his
theories Why does he call you

ASHER

Sorry

He replaces the gun on the pillow Kmao flicks open a
switchblade and cuts open one end of a bamboo shaft He
slowly plunges the blade into its contents

Kmao withdraws the knife and hands it over to Asher He works
a bit of powder off the tip of the blade and snorts it

No burn baby

He snorts through his other nostril Nothing Kmao clicks his
tongue and brings Asher a bowl

lights it Asher gently pulls on the opium pipe keeps it
going at a consistent sustainable pace He has it this time

ANGLE ON the red ball as it begins to shrink and finally

A hand suddenly reaches around Julie and grabs her breast as
if testing the ripeness of a fruit

volatile energy of a meth-head and the lean hardness of an
ex-con

WEATHERLY

Glen locks eyes with Weatherly staring him down

DRUNK GERMAN

The German reaches for Julie but is thwarted as she fills his
groping paw with a ready cocktail

She peels Glens hand off her breast plucks bills from the
Germans tab pile and heads for the cash register at the
other end of the bar

GLEN
Why would you come here if youre
a faggot

WEATHERLY

Glen breaks the standoff with a jagged twitch of a grin and
goes off after Julie

He comes up behind her at the register as she organizes her
receipts and money

GLEN
My supply is fucked I have
nothing to sell Airport John
that California assholehas
disappeared

He nuzzles the back of her neck and gropes her body as he
hisses into her ear

GLEN
Youre smart You know a market of
need is a sellers market We can
all make a lot of money here Julie

She tolerates his invasiveness with the detached and
patronizing manner of an adult coping with a brat-child

GLEN
Now where the fuck is your boy

JULIE
My boys at the source So
therell be more where this came
from

GLEN
This hasnt come yet

JULIE

The expression on the girls face
He took shot after shot of this

air He triumphantly holds a shiny quarter aloft Julie
applauds as Asher swims toward her edge

Asher climbs out and dries himself beside Julie The
missionary flops into the water and begins breast stroking

as he reaches the edge of the plateau and disappears down
into the mist of the mountain side

explodes like a balloon filled with blood He crumples to the
ground

herself down the road as fast as she can

Bickering ensues amongst the guards as Mao Cap proclaims his
innocence Scarface abruptly ends the argument with a bullet

down the road

liquid kaleidoscope as Julie slips and slides down the path

EXT MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

The path converges into the old road a rutted mishmash of
pavement and dusty earth The sun beats directly down on
Julie her face red her lips dry and chapped

Her jog has slowed to a fast hobbling walk She comes around
a snaking corner

ANGLE ON the shirtless sunburnt missionary curled up in
a heap on the road ahead of her He sobs into his hands He
looks up at Julie as she passes without acknowledging him
bLue

EXT FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD - DAY

In the distance Julie can make out the shimmering of light
reflecting off camera lenses

which hangs horizontally across the road A pair of
disinterested Cambodian soldiers patrol the inside of the
barricade

Julie picks up her pace breaking into a gleeful schoolgirl
skip as she draws closer

ANGLE ON The frenzied press jockeying for position at the
barricade The soldiers attempt to keep them at bay blowing
their whistles and shouting in Khmer

ANGLE ON Julie It occurs to her that something is amiss
as she draws closer No one is running out to meet her She
comes to a halt

front of the throng He sees something in the distance

missionary - finish line kick in gear - lumbers past her We
hear the click of a landmine followed by an earth-shattering
explosion

ANGLE ON the blue sky filling the screen Peaceful
silence Just blue

CRANE UP to reveal that were actually looking into
Ashers lifeless eye A puddle of blood haloes around his
head The camera rises to reveal the two fresh graves lying
empty We pull higher and higher above to a birds-eye view
Then we plummet earthward toward the church the graves and
finally into the blue of Ashers eye
