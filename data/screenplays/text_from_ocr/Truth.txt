THE MAN IN PROFILE Seated in a chair on the wings of a
stage Silhouetted by a spotlight From ONSTAGE

poor speller Thats why the Houston
Chronicle put him on the radio instead

was their news director

Chuckles from the crowd Our man withdraws a NOTEPAD from
his pocket Jotting something down His speech maybe

On stage Andrew Heyward - President of CBS News (50s
mustached) addresses the crowd a sea of tuxedos and gowns

ANDREW HEYWARD (CONTD)
To call his beginnings humble would
be generous A graduate of that
most notable of journalism schools
The Sam Houston State Teachers
College in 1959 he took his first
job in the burgeoning medium of
television A year later when a
hurricane hit Galveston he convinced
his cameraman to shoot the radar
screen showing Americans for the
first time how a storm worked He
was the first journalist to report
that John F Kennedy had been shot
He described the Zapruder film in
detail to a nation that was not
allowed to see it He became the
White House Correspondent at 33 years
of age and the Chief London
Correspondent a year later He helped
bring the horrors of the Vietnam War
into American living rooms for the
first time

ANDREW HEYWARD (CONTD)
At a Broadcaster Convention in 1974

to appear but not take questions

JOSH
MARY

Old Texas Pol

MARY (CONTD)
Barnes says when he was Speaker of
the Texas House in 68 Sid Adger
this big oilman comes into his office
and asks for help getting young George
Bush into the National Guard as a
pilot Poppy Bush at this point is
a Congressman and Barnes figures he
can use all the connections he can
get so he says he called General
Rose who runs the Texas Air National
Guard and gets Bush a slot

JOSH
Barnes told you this

MARY
Completely off the record but hes
been dining out on the story for
years Then I talk to Buck Staudt
who was Bushs squadron commander
He starts screaming at me about how
Barnes is full of shit because
everybody knows that hes the one
who pulled the strings to get Bush
into the Guard not Barnes

Josh laughs

MARY (CONTD)
Politics in Texas Its the
intergalactic capital of shit happens
Anyway while Bush is in the Guard
he meets a guy named James Bath and
they become running buddies After
they get out Bath with no resume
to speak of becomes chief financial
representative for the Bin Laden
Familys interests in Texas Bush
starts up Arbusto and Bath writes
him a 50000 check

Laden money

INT CBS NEWS -- DALLAS BUREAU CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

A series of MILITARY FILES spread out across the table
Lucy Scott and Roger Charles working as Smith and Mary enter
The former Marine raises an eyebrow at the newcomer

COLONEL CHARLES
Oh good You brought me a hippie

MARY
This is Mike Smith he worked this
with me in 2000 He has no social
graces whatsoever

SMITH
Its true

COLONEL CHARLES
Your Arbusto tip is for shit Bin
Laden money never got near Bush

SMITH
So what am I doing here

MARY
We found something else Bushs
time in the Guard There are some

gaps

COLONEL CHARLES
You are looking at George W Bushs
entire Texas Air National Guard file

SMITH
You mean whats left of it right
(realizing)
Youre doing a paper trail

The Colonel picks up a file

COLONEL CHARLES
What we have starts here - May 1968
bloodiest month of the conflict
Bush is accepted to the Texas Air
National Guard for flight training

MARY
If you believe Ben Barnes he got
Bush onto the waiting list

COLONEL CHARLES
If there even was a waiting list
Some people say yes some people say
no That one General

He snaps his fingers trying to remember

SMITH
Belisario Flores

Colonel Charles looks at Smith - not bad

COLONEL CHARLES
Former head of the Texas Guard he
said there was a waiting list over
a hundred people on it

LUCY
So Bush jumped the list

COLONEL CHARLES
We have no document showing any kind
of waiting list

SMITH
Bush says he got in so quickly because
they were specifically looking for
pilots which is bullshit with so
many pilots rotating back from
Vietnam And thats another thing -
training a National Guard pilot from
start to finish was a huge rarity

LUCY
Why

COLONEL CHARLES
Because its not cost effective
Lot of National Guard jocks are former
Air Force pilots who want to maintain
their flight rating

SMITH
Why spend a million bucks training a
new pilot when you can just admit a
(MORE )
SMITH (CONTD)
guy the Air Force already taught how
to fly The only thing that makes
Bush an attractive candidate for the
Guard is who hes connected to

COLONEL CHARLES
Either way hes in Signed on for
a six year commitment Does his
pilot training at Moody and is then
assigned to the 111th Fighter
Intercept Squadron in Houston
Records show he does really well
here high marks in every rating
period until the spring of 1972
Then nothing No flights no
appearing for duty Until August 1
when he is suspended in writing for
missing a routine physical

MARY
So how does someone go from being a
top-notch pilot to not even taking
your physical

COLONEL CHARLES
Not only that but he requests and
is granted a reassignment to Alabama
to work on a friends Senate campaign

LUCY
Wait - he disobeys an order and then
they let him transfer

COLONEL CHARLES
It gets better From May 1972 to
May 1973 his record shows no points
registered Points are like hours
on a time card in the Guard It
basically means he didnt show up
The Alabama commander has no
recollection of him No eyewitness
has ever placed him on base and no
paperwork exists to prove he was
ever there

Lucy looks from one of them to the other

A beat

LUCY
Youre telling me the President of
the United States may have gone AWOL
from the military for over a year

COLONEL CHARLES
We have no proof of that

LUCY
What does the White House say

SMITH
That Bush served honorably and that
military records go missing all the
time

COLONEL CHARLES

By the way military records do not
go missing all the time Theyre
the military Theyre good at shit

(looking at file)
Bush is not heard from in the records
again until July 1973 when he shows
up for drills And in September
1973 he requests and is granted an
early discharge to attend Harvard
Business School

LUCY
He asks to quit nine months early
and they let him

SMITH
And he resigned his commission in
74 which is very weird Youre
commissioned for life right Why
resign it It makes no sense

Mary looks around the room

MARY
So what are the questions were
looking to answer

SMITH
One - did Bush go into the Guard to
avoid going to Vietnam

LUCY
Not to be cynical but who didnt
try to get into the Guard to avoid
Nam back then

COLONEL CHARLES
Me

The military man says it without blinking

A beat

MARY
Bushs trainer in the 147th said he
wanted to go to Vietnam

COLONEL CHARLES
(holds up a paper)
This is the only document in the
official record that deals with it
On the question of desiring overseas
transfer Bush checked No

MARY
Bushs trainer says that must have
been a mistake

SMITH
Cause thats a question you get
wrong

MARY

Two - why did he skip the physical

SMITH
He didnt have a drug problem he
just liked the way it smelled

Lucy laughs

MARY
And Three - if someone did pull
strings for him who And how the
hell do we get them to go on the
record

cups of coffee in front of both of them

JIM MOORE
Colonel Burkett is nuts
MARY
Oh good
JIM MOORE

But hes also on the level

MARY
Youre sure

JIM MOORE
Hes a whistle-blower
(MORE )

JIM MOORE (CONTD)
And whistle-blowers are consistently
unbalanced angry grudge-holders
Thats what makes them want to blow
their whistles in the first place

(leaning forward)

He claims he was there for the
scrubbing

MARY
The scrubbing

JIM MOORE
Of Bushs Guard file 1997 Burkett
George Conn a couple other people
say that a bunch of Bushies went
down to the Guard Headquarters in
Austin and made certain unfavorable
parts of his file disappear Youve
seen the official record right
Holes in it big enough to drive a
truck through

MARY
So you believe him

JIM MOORE
Enough to devote a hundred and twenty
pages in my new book to him

He takes a sip of his coffee

JIM MOORE (CONTD)
Youre going to want to be careful
with this The administration doesnt
take kindly to this type of reporting

MARY
I didnt exactly make friends with
them on Abu Ghraib-

JIM MOORE
This is different Youre talking
about screwing with the man himself

MARY
The President

JIM MOORE
After I did my first book on Bush
My name mysteriously popped up on
the terrorist no-fly list Now I
cant hop a puddle jumper without a
strip search They dont forget

INT MARYS HOUSE -- FRONT HALL -- DAY
Mary coming home hears SMITHS VOICE coming from the kitchen

SMITH (0OS)
-Then you gotta know about the
1996 Telcom Act

INT MARYS KITCHEN -- DAY
Smith sits across from Robert who is interviewing him

SMITH
See the rules were no company could
own more than one TV station radio
station or newspaper in the same
market - so no one could have a
monopoly on the flow of information
But the 96 Act eliminated the cross
ownership ban and now TV News is
controlled by only five corporations -
GE Disney Time Warner NewsCorp
and Viacom - which owns CBS And
all of these mega-corporations rely
on what

Robert just stares at him

ROBERT
Im seven

SMITH
On corporate tax breaks and favorable
government legislation That means
the government controls the financial
well-being of the very institutions
that are supposed to report on them
At best its collusion Can you
still report the news Sure As
long as it doesnt get in the way of
the golden rule - thou shalt always
protect the company
MARY
Ever think maybe youre just paranoid

Smith turns to see her standing there

Silence

SMITH
Once But I dismissed it as paranoia
(rising)
We have a problem Burketts talking
to other outlets New York Times
Vanity Fair-

MARY
You gotta get him to meet with us
and bring the documents

SMITH
He does that he loses all his
bargaining power He wants money

MARY
We dont do that

SMITH
Hes worried hes going to have to
relocate after this Hes worried
this will put him in danger Shit
hes worried his phone is tapped

MARY
Arent you

SMITH
Mary if these really are missing
pieces of a sitting Presidents
military record we are talking about
the Holy Grail of documents If we
wont pay someone else will

The clock ticks Mary slowly

MARY
Tell Burkett we dont believe him

SMITH
But we do believe him

MARY
Tell him if he wants to keep us on
the hook hes going to have to show
us something to prove his story
Smith stares at her
MARY (CONTD)
You get me in a room with those
documents and I will close him
EXT WHATABURGER -- DAY

MARY

Whataburger rendezvous with a man
who wants to bring down the President
of the United States and we dont
even know what he looks like

A RAPPING on Marys window and she turns to see a very TAN
OLDER WOMAN standing there Behind her is a taller gaunt
older man COLONEL BILL BURKETT Looks around suspicious

BURKETT
Yall stay in the car In case
someone listened to our calls were
gonna go to a secondary location

Mary gives Smith a look as Burkett heads back to his car
INT INDIAN SAMS -- DAY

The foursome occupy a BOOTH Colorful kids placemats in
front of them A birthday party in the background Nicki
helps Burkett take sucks off an oxygen mask as a WAITRESS
delivers four huge sodas to the table When shes gone--

BURKETT
I saw it with my own eyes They put
the parts of Bushs file they didnt
like in a wastebasket

MARY
And do you have these documents

NICKI
Bill tried to talk about this in
2000 and someone ran us off the road
one night

BURKETT
I aint scared of them-

NICKI
Well I am I am scared

She takes a deep gulp of iced tea Nerves shot
BURKETT
Lets say I have the documents

Why

should we show em to you Why not

one of the newspapers-—

MARY

Because nobody reads newspapers

Burkett blinks

BURKETT

One of the other networks then-

MARY
I dont know if youve noticed

but

not many people actually do what we

do anymore
(pause)

Were 60 Minutes Were the gold

standard And we can help you

Look you come on camera and well-

NICKI

No No cameras Our name stays out

of this

(to Burkett)
They will destroy us for this
you understand

She looks at her husband pleading Mary

MARY
Nicki listen I know what it

Dont

stares at her

s

like to be bullied To feel like
theyre too strong that youre small
and powerless But you are not

And doing this will show them that

(pause)

I promise We will protect you

A beat Nicki and Burkett exchange a gla
has shifted at the table And then very
pulls out a photocopied piece of paper
111th Fighter Interceptor Squadron

And the date

O01 August 1972

nce Like a weight
slowly Burkett
The top reads

Marys eyes flit over different words and phrases -

1st Lt Bush be suspended from flight status due to failure
to perform to USAFTexANG standards

No attempt to meet his training certification or flight
Physical

-Desire to transfer out of state including assignment to
non-flying billets

Mary looks up at Burkett

MARY (CONTD)
This is signed by Jerry Killian

Burkett hands them a second document

BURKETT
This too First one says Bush made
no attempt to meet his training
certification - thats a big
difference than just missing his
physical Second one refers to his
pilot position as critical

SMITH
Bush said he stopped flying because
he was no longer needed as a pilot

BURKETT
This document would prove that
statement untrue

MARY
Can you think of anyone who would
want to fool you with these Like a
political dirty trick

Burkett blinks The thought never occurred to him
BURKETT
I cant believe someone would hate

me that much

SMITH
Do you have the originals

BURKETT
No I was only given copies And
dont ask me where Im not telling
you anything else You get some
experts of your own to look at them

Mary nods as Smith signals for the check

MARY
We will

DAN
Is there any doubt in your mind that
these memos are genuine

STRONG
Well they are compatible with the
way business was done at that time
They are compatible with the man
that I remember Jerry Killian being

Off to the side Mary Lucy and Smith stand watching

DAN
What do you think Colonel Killian
was trying to do with these memos

STRONG
I think he was trying to get a duty
performed and I think he was trying
to protect himself because of the
political environment in which he
found himself

DAN
Political considerations were a major
force in the Guard

STRONG
It verged on outright corruption the
favors that were done the power
that was traded

(MORE )

STRONG (CONTD)
From a moral and ethical standpoint
it was unconscionable

Colonel Charles looks over to Mary dozing a few seats away

COLONEL CHARLES
You know why Mary didnt get this
story done in 2000 dont you

Lucy shakes her head

COLONEL CHARLES (CONTD)

Her mother died Right in the middle
of it So this story never got
finished and the election happened
An election decided by 537 votes

(pause)
Sometimes I think if Marys mom hadnt
died that summer theres a good
chance Al Gore would be President
right now

LUCY
What about her father

COLONEL CHARLES
Marys father is a drunken piece of
shit who hated himself so much that
he beat his daughters The more
outspoken they were the harder he
hit them How do you think she fared

Lucy looks at Marys sleeping form
LUCY

Shed get beat up for asking
questions

Ive been doing some internet

MARY
Have you found anything wrong with

MARY
Do they appear forged in any way

EMILY WILL
Without the originals to ink test-

MARY
Let me worry about the investigational
side of the story

EMILY WILL
I always work the whole thing

Establishing exact chain of custody

determining authenticity

MARCEL MATLEY
I would say based on our available
handwriting evidence yes this is
the same person

(MORE )

MARCEL MATLEY (CONTD)
Now this signature on the June 24th
document shows some conspicuous
differences but it also shows what
I call inconspicuous similarities to
Colonel Killians handwriting

DAN
Why might differences like that exist

MARCEL MATLEY
The content of the memo is highly
stressful Killian telling a higher
up that he cannot rate Bush during
his absence This is enough to
explain differences in the penstrokes

Dan just stares at him

DAN
Would you give us a moment

He turns and walks over to where Mary stands

DAN (CONTD)
Its like listening to someone
describing paint dry-

MARY
He said it though It was in there
somewhere Can you get the bite

Dan nods and walks back to Matley

DAN
Are you saying that if I present
these to the American public and
say to the best of our knowledge
these documents were all signed by
the same man I am going to be on

MARY
Super Pro-Bush so theyd never go

maybe determining life or death

BETSY
Mary whats going on These blogs
are saying the memos can be recreated
exactly in Microsoft Word

Mary blinks

MARY
Whos saying this

BETSY
A conservative website
(MORE )

BETSY (CONTD)
(reading a printout)
Every one of these memos to file is
in a proportionally spaced font
probably Palatino or Times New Roman

As she continues reading Mary swivels back to her computer
opens MS Word grabs a memo and begins to RETYPE IT

BETSY (CONTD)
In 1972 typewriters used monospaced
fonts The use of proportionally
spaced fonts did not come into common
use until the introduction of personal
computers They were not widespread
until the mid to late 90s Before
then you needed typesetting
equipment and that wasnt used for
personal memos to file I am saying
these documents are forgeries run
through a copier for 15 generations
to make them look old

She stops as Mary holds a copy of the memo up to the screen
Staring at them both They look nearly IDENTICAL

BETSY (CONTD)
Mary what the hell is going on

Mary stares at the screen She has no idea

They say it didnt exist on
typewriters in the 1970s

LUCY
One of our examiners raised that
concern as well

Mary shoots her a glance

MARY

they did have them and she deferred
to him

SCHWARTZ
They will kill us on that They
will kill us on that alone

I dont understand what do they
want

MARY

They want us to say were wrong
Because if were wrong all the
questions we asked about the

We have Bob Strong who worked at
Guard headquarters and says the memos
are written in the vernacular of the
Guard at the time And we have Bobby

In fact other Bush military records
already released by the White House

yes this is the same person

You tell ‘em that Dan

I did not sir

It says a highly placed CBS source
referred to me as your trump card-

General that was not me and it was
not Dan-

Because Im not Ive seen all the
coverage and I have to say I think
the memos are fakes

You- Excuse me

Dan looks over at Mary - what the hell

GENERAL HODGES (0S)
I do not believe Jerry Killian wrote
those memos

Mary is frantically going through her notebook

MARY
Sir when we spoke on September 6th-
Im sorry Im just going through my
notes- when we spoke you said the
content of the memos was familiar to
you is that correct

GENERAL HODGES (0S)
Yes

MARY
And that they reflected Colonel
Killians mindset at the time

GENERAL HODGES (0S)
They do But I hadnt physically
seen them-

MARY
What physically about the memos makes
you now doubt their authenticity

GENERAL HODGES (0S)
Jerrys family says he didnt write
them

Mary looks like shes about to pop a blood vessel Dan tries
a different tack

DAN
General the thrust of our story was
about what happened with the
Presidents guard service Now if
as you say Colonel Killian really
felt this way and the things described
in the memos - pressure from higher
up to get him in and then to give
him breaks is true we would like to
talk to you about that

Im just telling you I now believe
the memos are forgeries-

presented regarding President Bush
accurate

specific room so I did This Ramirez
woman told me she was supposed to be
a go-between a person to deliver a
package of documents to me

Betsy scribbles furiously to get this all down

I was supposed to copy the documents
inside and then burn the originals

of where they come from you see

Of course

So she says When are you gonna be

BURKETT
Okay

BURKETT
They didnt want me to say how I got

Betsy begins writing something on a card

BURKETT
Yes

She hands the card to Mary - So thats why you lied you us
Mary looks at her Betsy nods urging go on

BURKETT (CONTD)
Your producer was pushing me to find
out where I got the memos from

Mary hands Dan the card who scans it

DAN
So thats why you lied to us

BURKETT
Yes And I know it caused some
problems

He reaches for the water again Dan pauses as he takes a
several gulps from it Betsy is writing another card

Why didnt you tell us the truth when you gave us the memos

Mary raises an eyebrow at her Betsy gives her another go
on look Mary hands the card to Dan while Burkett breathes
Dan looks at Mary Not pleased but hell do it

DAN
(to Burkett gently)
Whenever youre ready

Burkett nods Finishes with the water Nicki takes it from
him not pleased with how this is going

DAN (CONTD)
You say you knew this would cause
problems

BURKETT
I know it did I didnt know it would

DAN
So again why didnt you just tell
us the truth when you gave us the
memos

An exhale from Nicki on the sidelines Not happy with this

BURKETT
I was trying to protect people Dan
People who were trying to tell the
truth about what happened back then

Betsy writing again - So you decided to lie about where the
documents came from Mary shakes her head Not doing it

DAN
And you believe these documents are
telling the truth

BURKETT

Betsy hands it to Dan herself Dan looks at it Frowns

camera You made him say again and
again that he lied and it still

You want to wrap it all up in a neat
package and say Its all Bill

And Im going to apologize for the
story on air

MARY
Andrew asked you to apologize

Dan looks up at her

DAN
He did not ask

MARY
Its surrender

DAN
Since Burkett changed his story
Andrew says CBS will no longer risk
its reputation on this

MARY
He knew Even before we went down
there He just wanted Burkett on
tape

DAN
I need you to do me a favor I need
you to stop worrying about me

INT MARYS OFFICE -- EVENING

Mary sits on her couch Josh across from her ON TV - The
feed from the EVENING NEWSCAST downstairs

DAN
Last week amid increasing questions
about the authenticity of documents
used in support of a 60 Minutes
Wednesday story about President Bushs
time in the Texas Air National Guard
CBS News vowed to re-examine the
documents in question and their
source vigorously And we promised
that we would let the American Public
know whatever the outcome-

Mary clicks off her TV Cant watch anymore She looks at
Josh Then

MARY
Im sorry this was your first story
here

JOSH

Im thinking next week we should
just have Dan shoot the President
Would cause much less drama

Mary laughs Josh smiles A nice moment Broken by Betsy
coming through the door a strange look on her face

BETSY
Mary USA Today wants to know if
you put Burkett in touch with the
Kerry campaign in exchange for
documents

MARY
I know what this is about Josh
remember when I told you Burkett
wanted to give the Kerry campaign
advice on the swift boat stuff

Josh just stares at her

MARY (CONTD)
I wanted to do a bullshit check on
Burkett after he said hed talked to
(MORE )
MARY (CONTD)

Howard Dean You said I could contact
the Kerry people to check and then
Burkett wanted me to give them his
phone number and you said I could
so I did

(pause)
Do you remember any of this

JOSH
(softly)
I must not have made myself clear
You must have misunderstood what I
said you could do

Mary looks at him stricken

BETSY
Jesus Christ What else is going to
fucking happen here Unbelievable

exit TVs on the wall play the CBS EVENING NEWS Dans
voice echoing all around her

DAN (0S)
After extensive additional interviews
I no longer have the confidence in
these documents that would allow us
to continue vouching for them
journalistically I find we have
been misled on the key question of
how our source for the documents
came into possession of these papers
That combined with some of the
questions that have been raised in
public and in the press leads me to

(MORE )

DAN (0S) (CONTD)
a point where if I knew then what I
know now I would not have gone ahead
with the story as it was aired and
I certainly would not have used the
documents in question

She pushes out through the doors into the night

Colonel Charles flips the page

Second campaign was run by Karl Rove
But the crown jewel of his resume is
serving as US Attorney General
from 1988 to 1991 under former
President George HW Bush

panel worked for Bushs father

Silence

MARY
Jesus Who goes in first

SMITH
Dan then me then Lucy the Colonel
then you Youre the grand finale

SMITH

Do you even understand whats
happening right now

JOSH

I understand that youre leaving

SMITH
Right now Viacom is lobbying a
Republican controlled Congress for
deregulation and tax breaks that
would save the company hundreds of
millions of dollars - and we just
aired a report that could cost
Republicans the Presidency

JOSH
(into the phone)
Security to the 9th floor now please

SMITH

You dont think Viacom needs the
Administration on their side You
dont think theyre desperate to
make it up to them right now Make
up for CBS running stories on Abu
Ghraib and the President and Vietnam
and all the shit that isnt part of
their regularly scheduled programming
Everyone wants this to disappear

(disgusted)
Theres a fucking election at stake
Were supposed to question everything
and you wont even question this

Peoples heads poke out of their offices at the yelling

JOSH
Are you done

SMITH
You know when the FCC repealed cross
ownership laws a single company was
allowed to own forty-five percent of
the National Market Share Forty-
five percent People fucking flipped
They actually wrote their congressmen
So in the 2003 Appropriations Bill
Congress overturned it Hooray for
democracy right

A crowd has now gathered around this ranting former employee

SMITH (CONTD)
Except the President wouldnt sign
it Bush threatened to veto the
entire bill unless a compromise was
found at thirty-nine percent and
why Because at that exact
percentage both Viacom and Newscorp
wouldnt have to sell off any
stations The President of the United
States was ready to take down the
entire federal budget so that Viacom
wouldnt lose money

JOSH
Youre right Were all evil and
youre the plucky misunderstood hero
It wasnt that you guys fucked up a

feminism

Like each word is a slap

be the producer of the show She

INT BLACK ROCK -- CONFERENCE ROOM -- AFTERNOON
Missal slides a stack of papers across the table

MIKE MISSAL
Id like to talk a little about
language

MARY
Absolutely

MIKE MISSAL
These are the printouts of emails
sent back and forth by your group
during the investigation

Hibey pages through them

MIKE MISSAL (CONTD)
In this one to Mike Smith what did
the two of you mean when you discussed
a piece of tasty brisket

MARY
That referred to a piece of
information Mike uncovered working
on a documentary for the Germans

MIKE MISSAL
A piece of information against the
President

MARY
I think specifically it referred to
Bush losing his nerve while flying
MIKE MISSAL
Which was not mentioned in the report
you aired on 60 Minutes

MARY
I didnt think we had it nailed down

MIKE MISSAL
So is it accurate to say that you
were looking for anything negative
about the President

Hibey looks over to Mary Careful here

MARY
I would say its accurate that we
were looking for any information
about his time in the Air National
Guard that had not yet come to light

MIKE MISSAL
And thats why its tasty Not
because it reflected poorly on the
President

MARY
It was tasty because it had the
potential to be newsworthy Mike
and I are friends we use a shorthand
Sarcasm jokes

LARRY LANPHER
Is that common in your industry

MARY
I suppose

LARRY LANPHER
When dealing with matters as serious
as this its common to make jokes

MARY
I can assure you we take our work
very seriously

MIKE MISSAL
I also wanted to ask you about this
email from Roger Charles where he
says he feels better about the
(MORE )
MIKE MISSAL (CONTD)
documents because of their formatting
Colonel Charles originally thought
the documents were fake

Mary blinks

MARY
I dont believe so

MIKE MISSAL
Then why would he say here that he
feels better

MARY
Because it seemed that what our source
was telling us was true

LARRY LANPHER
I have to disagree Even the subject
line of the email is I feel better
with three exclamation points It
seems that Colonel Charles initially
had doubts

MARY
You would have to ask Colonel Charles

Hibey nods Good answer But Mary continues

MARY (CONTD)
But also Id say he was coming from
a place of not being sure whether
the memos were real or not and then
becoming confident that they were

LARRY LANPHER
Really
(smiles )
Youll forgive me for saying but
your testimony so far doesnt bear
that out

HIBEY
(sensing danger)
This isnt testimony remember
LARRY LANPHER
If it was impossible to authenticate
the memos doesnt it stand to reason
that you initially assumed that the
memos were real rather than the other
way around

MARY
I wouldnt say that

LARRY LANPHER
Well what would you say

Mary stares at him

On Hibey

LARRY LANPHER (CONTD)
It seems to me you assumed these
memos were real from the outset and
you looked to make sure that nothing
disproved that Essentially you
took the position that the President
was guilty until proven innocent

Shit

MARY
We took several steps to vet these
memos

LARRY LANPHER
Such as
Theres only two signatures and two
sets of initials - hardly enough
comparison for a handwriting match
You said yourself no ink or carbon
tests could be performed in fact
two of the four analysts you hired
have said they had strong reservations
about the memos authenticity

MARY
Much of the formatting and terminology
used is consistent with the period-

LARRY LANPHER
Thats debatable-
MARY
(insisting)
Is consistent with the period as is
the content of the memos which was
verified by several different sources
who knew Colonel Killian-

LARRY LANPHER
Then what about this
(reading a memo)
OETR Is this one of the
terminologies that was consistent
with the period

MARY
I believe so

LARRY LANPHER
Whats it stand for

MARY
Officer Effectiveness Training
Report

LARRY LANPHER
Actually the correct acronym is

OER - Officer Effectiveness
Report No T
(pause)

Isnt it true Mary that the phrase
Officer Effectiveness Training
Report doesnt actually appear
anywhere on any official documents
That this phrase is something you
created to explain this incorrect
abbreviation in your memos

Hibey stares at Mary stricken Checkmate

MARY
Thats not true

LARRY LANPHER
It isnt

MARY
I wouldnt do something like that

LARRY LANPHER

PRESIDENT BUSH
I told you that the other day and
you probably thought I was just
seeking votes But now that you
voted I really meant it

LAUGHTER from the press corps

PRESIDENT BUSH (CONTD)
I appreciate the hard work of the
press corps We all put in long
hours and youre away from your
families for a long period of time
But the country is better off when
we have a vigorous and free press
covering our elections Without
over-pandering Ill answer a few
questions Hunt

Over more laughter reporter TERENCE HUNT speaks

TERENCE HUNT
Mr President thank you As you
look at your second term how much
is the war in Iraq going to cost
Do you intend to send more troops
or bring troops home And in the
Middle East more broadly do you
agree with Tony Blair that
revitalizing the Middle East peace
process is the single most pressing
political issue facing the world

PRESIDENT BUSH
Now that Ive got the will of the
people at my back Im going to start
enforcing the one-question rule
That was three questions

More laughter They love this guy The phone rings and
Mary mutes the TV to answer it

MARY
Im working on a chardonnay Xanax
cocktail if it makes you feel any
better How are you

EXT DANS APARTMENT -- BALCONY -- NIGHT

Dan takes a swallow of scotch and steps out to the
INTERCUT

DAN
Did you know that 60 Minutes was the
first news program to ever make money
Before that all news divisions
operated at a financial loss

He looks out at the city

DAN (CONTD)
When the government gave networks
the airwaves it was with the
stipulation that they would be used
in some capacity for the public good
And that was the news They made
their money elsewhere on the schedule
But reporting the news was a duty
A public trust

Mary doesnt say anything

DAN (CONTD)
When Hewitt started 60 Minutes in
1968 it built to enormous ratings
It was wonderful People were really
watching news Caring And we
figured out a way to give it to them

balcony
DAN (CONTD)
(sips)
I was there Mary I was there the
day they figured out news could make
money

The traffic below him is honking He doesnt seem to notice

DAN (CONTD)

After a while it dawned on them how
come the Evening News isnt a profit
center too Why arent the morning
shows earning more If you interview
Survivor contestants instead of
survivors of genocide your ad rates
go up Pretty soon we wont even
run down our own stories cause its
too expensive Well just pay someone
else to do it then read them on the
air for show

(pause)
It was a public trust once I swear
to you it was

Very softly Mary asks him again

MARY
How are you doing Dan

Dan drains the rest of the scotch and examines his glass

DAN
Im stepping down as anchor

In her kitchen Mary stands very still

MARY
When

DAN
After Inauguration

MARY
Oh Dan

DAN
You didnt cause this Mary

MARY
Youre a shitty liar you know that
(MORE )
MARY (CONTD)
(tears in her eyes)
Why didnt you ask me Everyone
else asked after the shit hit the
fan why didnt you

DAN
Ask you what

MARY
Why didnt you ask me if the documents
were real

DAN
Because I knew I didnt need to

Mary is silent
DAN (CONTD)
When you go back in there you hold
your head up understand

Mary smiles through the tears

INT BLACK ROCK -- SIDE ROOM -- AFTERNOON

Thunder and lightning outside Late in the day Dinner
break Mary watches Panel members through the open door

HIBEY
Youre doing great Another half
hour and were done

Mary nods her mind anywhere but here Like shes deciding
something Doodling absently on a legal pad FEA Hibey
looks at the letters on the page

HIBEY (CONTD)
What does that mean

She looks up at him
MARY
Fuck em all

INT BLACK ROCK -- CONFERENCE ROOM -- AFTERNOON

Mary and Hibey sit across from the panel One more time
Rain streaks the windows Things are wrapping up

MIKE MISSAL
--Well Im glad we have
clarification on that

HIBEY
Good If theres nothing else

Missal and the others move to rise Mary keeps her seat

MARY
Arent you going to ask about my
politics

Missal blinks Hibey shoots her a warning look

LARRY LANPHER
Excuse me

MARY
Youve asked other people what I
believe Arent you going to ask
me

HIBEY
(hissing to Mary)
What are you doing

The journalist LOU BOCCARDI finally speaks
LOU BOCCARDI
Well wouldnt you say most people
you work with think youre a liberal
MARY
Do you mean Am I now or have I
ever been a liberal

A number of the panel shifts in their seats uncomfortably

LARRY LANPHER
Its a legitimate question
A beat

Lanphers breathing hard

MARY
Is it

MIKE MISSAL
You brought it up

MARY
No you did when you asked all my co-
workers So Ill tell you I dont
believe in labels I think most
people have a mixture of views-

LARRY LANPHER
Thats not what were talking about

MARY
Then what are you talking about
Larry

LARRY LANPHER
Were talking about you bringing
your politics into your reporting

MARY
I did nothing of the kind

LARRY LANPHER

Really Nothing Is that why when
Barnes said he got Bush into the
Guard you believed him without
question That when Bill Burkett
an outspoken Bush critic and admitted
liar brought you memos you assumed
their authenticity and didnt bother
to source them That when not one
but two of your four document
examiners expressed doubts the memos
were real you pushed them aside and
rushed the story on air And why
you personally contacted John Kerrys
campaign on behalf of a man who had
dedicated himself to smearing the
President

(staring at her)
Tell me Mary where exactly does
politics not enter into any of this
Or are you just that bad at your
job

The others stare at him
Silence

MARY
Do you know what it would take to
fake these memos

HIBEY
Mary-

MARY

No this is important It would
require the forger to have an in
depth knowledge of the 1971 Air Force
manual including rules regulations
and abbreviations He would have to
know Bushs official record backwards
and forwards to make sure that none
of these memos conflicted with it
He would have to know all the players
in the Texas Air National Guard at
the time - not just their names but
their attitudes and opinions including
how they related to one another He
would have to know that Colonel
Killian kept personal memos for
himself like this in the first place
He would have to know how Killian
felt at the time particularly about
his superiors and then first
Lieutenant Bush He would have to
know or learn all of this in order
to fool us as you assume he did

(leaning forward)
Now Do you really think a man who
takes that kind of time and precision
then goes and types these up on
Microsoft Word

The men stare at her Nobody has a response to

that Thunder in the distance

MARY (CONTD)
Our story was about whether Bush
fulfilled his service But nobody
wants to talk about that They want
to talk about fonts and forgery and
conspiracy theories Because thats
what people do if they dont like a
story these days They point and
scream

(MORE )
MARY (CONTD)

They question your politics your
objectivity - hell your basic
humanity - and then they hope to God
the truth gets lost in the scrum

(shaking her head)
And when its finally over theyve
kicked and shouted so loud we dont
even remember what the point was

Rain continues to fall And then from the back of the room

DICK THORNBURGH
But you didnt prove it

They all turn to him The old man finally speaks

DICK THORNBURGH (CONTD)
You didnt prove Ben Barnes got the
President into the Guard You didnt
prove the memos are real The burden
of proof is on you

MARY
By that standard the Times would
never have run the Pentagon Papers
the Post would never have listened
to Deep Throat-

DICK THORNBURGH
Ben Barnes is hardly Deep Throat-

MARY
Ben Barnes has confessed to abusing
his power to keep some of the richest
and most privileged sons of Texas
from getting their asses blown up in
Vietnam

DICK THORNBURGH
Ms Mapes dont you think that its
possible just possible that some
of those fine young men got into the
National Guard on their own merit

Mary blinks A beat And then she answers truthfully

MARY
No sir No I do not

Thornburgh nods A beat Hes heard what he came to hear
EXT BLACK ROCK -- EVENING

The rain has grown to a downpour Mary and Hibey step out
the door Pausing at the edge of the deluge

HIBEY
Had to do it didnt you

MARY

am what I am

HIBEY
I wouldve gone with To thine own
self be true but Popeye works
(pause)
Theyll have their findings in a few
weeks I11 call you when I hear

off down the street

September 11th To our soldiers
sailors airmen and Marines in
dangerous places To those who have
endured the tsunami and to all who
have suffered natural disasters and
who must find the will to rebuild

lot it is to struggle in financial
hardship or in failing health to my
fellow journalists in places where
reporting the truth means risking
all and to each of you

Courage

Mary takes a breath Tears in her eyes

For the CBS Evening News Dan Rather
reporting Goodnight
The screen fades to black

IN THE STUDIO

Dan rises to thunderous applause Smiling at the people
there A little teary eyed himself Champagne is popped

Among those clapping Heyward Dan catches his eye Heyward
smiles Dan turns away from him and begins a conversation
Heywards smile falters just a bit But he keeps applauding

Dan turns and walks away from camera Leaving us Leaving
the stage

As he goes these words appear

The Independent Panel Report found no political bias in the
reporting of the Guard Story Josh Howard Mary Murphy and
Betsy West were asked to resign

Mary Mapes was fired

10 days later President George W Bush was inaugurated for
a Second Term

These words fade Replaced by

Dan Rather left CBS and sued claiming the network caved to
political pressure to placate the White House The suit was
dismissed by the New York Court of Appeals

As commercials and coming up next ads play on the
television Mary stares at the image Then slowly picks up

the remote and clicks it off Silence save for crickets

Mary takes another tissue and blows her nose Laughing at
the amount of tears Looks to her husband

MARY
You want to take a walk

Wrolstad grins and bounds to his feet He takes her hand
and leads her out the door And we get the feeling that
maybe just maybe theyll be okay

We hold on the door and slowly pan back to the television
Sitting there mercifully silent

As we PUSH IN these words appear on screen

Following Mary Mapes firing CBS News won a Peabody Award
for her story on Abu Ghraib

It is considered one of the most important pieces of
journalism of the decade

Mary Mapes has not worked in television news since 2004
