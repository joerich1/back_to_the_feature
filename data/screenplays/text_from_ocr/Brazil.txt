EXT CITYSCAPE - SUNSET

A beautiful golden sun is setting The sky is on fire The
CAMERA starts to move downwards A large neon sign rises
into shot It rests on top of a skyscraper and fills the
frame The building is neither past nor future in design
but a bit of both

Slowly we pan downwards revealing the city that spreads
below A glittering conglomeration of elevated transport
tubes smaller square buildings which are merely huge
with here and there the comparatively minuscule relics
of previous ages of architecture pavement level awnings
suggesting restaurants and shops Transparent tubes carry
whizzing transport cages past us an elevated highway
carrying traffic composed primarily of large transport
lorries passes through frame As we descend the sunlight
is blocked out and street lights and neon signs take over as
illumination Eventually we reach the upper levels of a
plush shopping precinct

INT SHOPPING PRECINCT - NIGHT

Xmas decorations are everywhere PEOPLE are busy buying
ogling discussing choosing wisely from the goodies on
display SHOPPERS are going by laden with superbly packaged
goods the shop windows are full of elaborately boxed

and be-ribboned who-knows-what In one window is a bank of
TV sets on the great majority of the screens is the face
of Mr Helpmann the Deputy Minister of Information He is
being interviewed No-one bothers to listen to Helpmann

INTERVIEWER
Deputy minister what do you believe
is behind this recent increase in
terrorist bombings

HELPMANN
Bad sportsmanship A ruthless
minority of people seems to have
forgotten certain good old fashioned
virtues They just cant stand
seeing the other fellow win If
these people would just play the
game instead of standing on the
touch line heckling

INTERVIEWER
In fact killing people

HELPMANN
In fact killing people theyd
get a lot more out of life

We PULL AWAY from the shop to concentrate on the shoppers
Helpmanns voice carries over the rest of the scene

INTERVIEWER
Mr Helpmann what would you say
to those critics who maintain that
the Ministry Of Information has

become too large and unwieldy
HELPMANN
David in a free society

information is the name of the
game You cant win the game if
youre a man short

Fur bedecked shoppers pass in front of what appears to be
banks of snow but as we pan along with them the snow
turns out to be fire-fighting foam It oozes out of a shop
front that is a charred twisted mass of metal frames
WORKMEN are busily sealing the opening with plywood sheets
SHOPPERS pay no attention to this Xmas carols are being
played by a Salvation Army style band calling themselves
Consumers For Christ Santa Clauss grotto is busy all is
well with the world

INTERVIEWER
And the cost of it all Deputy
Minister Seven percent of the
gross national produce

HELPMANN
I understand this concern on behalf
of the tax-payers People want
value for money and a cost-effective
service

INT OFFICE - NIGHT
CUT TO TV screen with Helpmann still talking

HELPMANN
That is why we always insist on
the principle of Information
Retrieval Charges These terrorists
are not pulling their weight and
its absolutely right and fair
that those found guilty should pay
for their periods of detention and
the Information Retrieval Procedures
used in their interrogation

PULL BACK to reveal a rather clinical office The TV rests
on a desk A WHITE COATED TECHNICIAN is sorting out his in-
tray Several Christmas cards are amongst he paperwork He
comes upon a Christmassy package which he rips open to
discover a shiny metal executive toy

CUT TO
THE BEETLE
Droning up near the ceiling
The Technician is disturbed by the buzz of the BEETLE as
it whirrs around the fluorescent light He rolls up some
paper and forms and gets up to swat the insect
INT OFFICE - NIGHT
The Technician gets up and balances a chair on top of his
desk He climbs up onto it attempting to swat the Beetle

still buzzing about the room just out of reach Beneath
him an automatic type-writing machine rattles away compiling
a typed list of names under the heading Information
Retrieval Subjects For Detention and Interview The machine
is being fed from a spool of paper which is being
rhythmically chopped by an automatic guillotine which neatly
leaves each name on a separate sheet with the title above
each name each sheet following its predecessor into a
holding basket In CLOSEUP we see the names on the sheets

of paper building up in the holding basket TONSTED

Simon TOPPER Martin F TROLLOPE Benjamin G TURB
William K TURNER John D Every name begins with T
INTERVIEWER

Do you think that the government
is winning the battle against
terrorists

HELPMANN
On yes Our morale is much higher
than theirs were fielding all
their strokes running a lot of
them out and pretty consistently
knocking them for six Id say
theyre nearly out of the game

The Technician is tottering on one leg on the chair on the
desk as he strains to swat the Beetle Swish swash oops
WHAP Gottcha

INTERVIEWER
But the bombing campaign is now in
its thirteenth year

HELPMANN
Beginners luck

The Beetles career comes to a halt squashed flat on

the brilliantly clean ceiling or has it As the
Technician clambers down from the rickety heights the
Beetles carcass comes unstuck from the ceiling and drops
silently into the typewriting machine which hiccoughs
hesitates and then types the letter B and hesitates and
then continues so that the next name is Buttle Archibald
The Technician fails to notice this and the machine
continues smoothly TUTWOOD Thomas T TUZCZLOW Peter

INTERVIEWER
Thank you very much Deputy
Minister

HELPMANN
Thank you David and a very
merry Christmas to you all

EXT HOUSING TOWERS - NIGHT

ZOOMING past foreground outdoor Xmas decorations we TIGHTEN
in on one of several massive residential tower blocks that
loom over what appears to be a poorer part of the city
INT BUTTLE FLAT - NIGHT

Helpmann and Interviewer are on the TV the end credits
rolling over them to the beat of a Mozart theme tune
PULLING BACK we reveal that the TV is in a conventional
sitting room conventionally decorated for Christmas out
the room is oddly encumbered by huge metal conduits that
snake unpleasantly across and through the walls Smaller
conduits radiate from the main one connecting the various
services that Central Services (the name emblazoned on the
metal) supply to this household A conventionally poor but
proud family occupies the room MRS BUTTLE is reading
Dickens Christmas Carol to GIRL BUTTLE who is about six
BOY BUTTLE plays quietly with a toy machine gun and some
action men dressed in security gear MR BUTTLE is putting
the final touches to a neatly wrapped Christmas present
which looks identical to the executive toy we have just
seen in he Technicians office

Faintly from outside comes a burst of laughter A tilt of
the CAMERA indicates that the laughter is coming from the
floor above

INT JILLS FLAT - NIGHT

The flat is very bare and basic The laughter is coming
from a cheap portable television showing Sgt Bilko From
BILKOS POV we look through an open door of a bathroom
straight at a mirror propped up by the bath to enable the
person in the bath to watch the TV The person in the bath
is JILL LAYTON washing the grime off herself while she
watches Bilko in the mirror From her POV in the mirror
the TV screen is suddenly obscured by part of the body of
a MAN in uniform

JILL
(scared)
Whos there

INT BUTTLES FLAT - NIGHT

The Buttle Family as before Mrs Buttle is closing the
book

MRS BUTTLE
There thats enough for tonight
He wont come Xmas Eve if you dont
get plenty of sleep

GIRL BUTTLE
Father Christmas cant come if we
havent got a chimney

MRS BUTTLE
Youll see
The Girl exchanges goodnight kisses with her parents and
leaves the room

GIRL BUTTLE
How will he get down from upstairs

BOY BUTTLE
Its a secret

We follow Girl Buttle out of the sitting room into
INT HALLWAY AND CHILDRENS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Girl Buttle enters her bedroom There is little or no light
there and she sees a bulky figure apparently lowering
himself into the room from the direction of the ceiling

GIRL BUTTLE
(unalarmed)
Youve come

As she moves the light from the hallway shows us the figure
of what looks like a commando on a night raid slowly
sliding down a pole in he middle of the room The pole at
the top end disappears through a hole in the ceiling Things
become immediately clearer

INT BUTTLE SITTING-ROOM - NIGHT

Crash Its a raid Battle-dressed SECURITY TROOPS smash
trough the door Another one swings from a rope kicks in
the window from the outside and enters that way Most
alarmingly of all a shower of plaster comes down from the
ceiling in which a fairly neat round hole appears and
through the hole comes a firemans pole down which slide
TWO MORE SECURITY TROOPS The whole thing is short brutal
and violent

Buttle is grabbed violently and stuffed into a baglike
canvas device that covers him from head to waist A metal
clamp goes round his neck a metal bar slides up the back
of the bag His hands are handcuffed to the metal bar In
seconds he has become a canvas parcel Meanwhile Girl
Buttle has been carried out of her bedroom and dumped into
the lap of her screaming mother Boy Buttle has his toy
machine gun knocked out of his hands by a Trooper who we
see is identical in dress to the action men Boy Buttle has
been playing with He rushes to his mother as guns are
viciously trained on them Troops are kicking open the
doors of other rooms and generally doing a good job An
OFFICIAL wearing plain clothes now enters from the front
door and during the turmoil is reading aloud from an
official document It goes something like this

OFFICIAL

most of which is part of the

audible wall paper while the chaos reigns As the front

door slams behind the captive relative peace returns

by Mrs

(he turns to leave
along with troopers)

Jills shocked face appears looking down through the hole
in the ceiling The faces of the workmen BILL and CHARLIE
also appear above and behind her

JILL
Mrs Buttle are you alright

The helmeted Security Troops in Buttles flat drop to
defensive positions and swing their machine guns up towards
the hole in the ceiling All three faces retreat

INT JILLS FLAT - NIGHT

CHARLIE
(starting back from
the hole with Bill
and Jill)
Eh Eh Eh Were Department of
Works Department of Works up here
Careful with those bloody things

Jill Charlie and Bill are hustled aside by a SECURITY MAN
who clears the firemans pole from the hole We can see
the Troops in the room below leaving A SECOND SECURITY
MAN has untied a rope hanging out of the open window He
coils the rope up neatly and the two Security Men leave
the flat

BILL
(to Jill as they
watch this highly
efficient operation)
Dont take any notice love its

animals Best in the world though
JILL

BILL

JILL

Buttles harmless

BILL

So saying he drops the manhole cover which is faced with
same material as the floor over the hole in the floor To
his surprise it drops neatly through the floor into the
flat below

CHARLIE
Bloody typical theyve gone back
to metric without telling us

INT BUTTLES FLAT - NIGHT

Mrs Buttle stands stunned in the middle of her decimated
flat The kids wail Slowly Mrs Buttle collapses slumping
to the floor with the receipt in her hand we tighten into
CLOSEUP of Receipt

JILL (0OS)
Mrs Buttle Mrs Buttle

INT RECORD CLERKS POOL - DAY

We come in on a CLOSE-UP of a pink version of the RECEIPT
being stamped and impaled on desk spike as we PULL OUT to
reveal an infinite expanse of regularly arranged metal
desks each desk with a built-in TV console and each
(except one) occupied by a CLERK Every desk is snowed
under with pieces of paper much like the receipts seen in
the previous scene More pacers are delivered to each desk
intermittently by way of pneumatic tube OFFICE BOYS bustle
about with even more paperwork From the back of the room
we get a view of the screens which show graphs tabulations
figures All of this activity is supervised from an
elevated walkway by MR KURTZMAN Satisfied that all is
well with his clerks he turns and walks towards his glass
enclosed private office at the top of the room his name

lettered on the opaque glass door Mr Kurtzman goes through
this door and as he closes it behind him all activity in
the Clerks pool ceases each Clerk adjusts his TV screen
with the flick of a switch and all the screens change to
something which looks very like The Good The Bad And The
Ugly

INT MR KURTZMANS OFFICE - DAY

Mr Kurtzman also has a TV console He sits behind his
desk reaches for his In-tray and without looking at the
console he turns his screen on He looks through a number
of files in his In-tray He is surprised to hear a VOICE
say Turn around real slow amigo Mr Kurtzman turns
around real slow his expression relaxes he thumps his TV
console with a large fist and the screen obediently flicks
to a display of figures He picks up a file which we see

as marked Buttle Archibald He opens the file and starts
punching the keyboard of the console The TV starts bleeping
in an alarmed way Mr Kurtzman is puzzled He punches

more figures The screen starts to flash Error error
error Mr Kurtzman sighs with frustration He presses an
intercom

MR KURTZMAN
(into intercom)
Mr Lowry will you step in here
please

He returns his attention puzzled to the file Nobody comes
into the office Mr Kurtzman gets up and walks over to

his door and opens it Beyond the door the room full of
CLERKS is obediently concentrating on the bleeping and
whirring consoles From Mr Kurtzmans POV we see that in
the centre of the room is an unoccupied desk

MR KURTZMAN
Does anyone know where Lowry is

Nobody knows Mr Kurtzman closes his door again A moment
later it seems to him and to us that he has heard the
crash of six guns blazing away at each other He re-opens
the door The only sound again He goes back to his desk

He punches a few keys The machine starts emitting even

more alarming beeps then horse whinnies then Admit youre
whupped you drygulching scum Kurtzman explodes with
anger and presses the intercom again

MR KURTZMAN
(shouting into
intercom)
Where the hell is Sam Lowry

EXT SKY - DAY

CUT TO brilliantly clear sky From on high an odd bird-
like figure swoops down on the CAMERA As it comes closer
we can see that it is in fact a MAN wearing strange wood
and metal bird wings In the bright sunshine their flapping
movements create a brilliant flashing effect Along with
the wings SAM LOWRY (for this is he) wears an outfit that
combines the best of Flash Gordon and a WWI fighter pilot
He sweeps past the CAMERA and then banking rises BACK
INTO SHOT IN MEDIUM CLOSEUP An ethereal voice can be heard
calling Sam Sam Sam He hovers looking beyond the
CAMERA to something wonderful CUT TO face of stunningly
beautiful GIRL she is the idealised twin of Jill Layton
Her long hair swirls across her face partially obscuring

it and making her appear slightly mysterious The CAMERA
PULLS AWAY from her as soft billowing material sinuously
undulates about her It rises and falls like waves carried
on the wind As the CAMERA GLIDES BACK through this sea of
gossamer we can see that the Girl is being held aloft by
and in it A vast landscape stretches below her The sun
frames her in the sky She and Sam are engaged in a
beautiful sensual aerial ballet

Romantic music fills the soundtrack

Sam swoops up and away The Girl floats in the distance as
Sam rises in the foreground She beckons to him Sam begins
to flap back towards her But then the dreamy quality of
this scene is interrupted by threatening rumble Sam looks
down

The ground far below him suddenly erupts as a massive
monolithic stone skyscraper bursts through the surface and
soars upwards with a mighty rush

CUT TO THE GIRL IN LONG SHOT The monolith rises up into
FRAME partially cutting her off from view

Before Sam can do anything another stone skyscraper breaks
through the ground and rushes upwards Then another and
another There is nothing Sam can do The Girl is being

cut of from him by these gigantic faceless structures And
then she is finally lost from view somewhere in the depths
of this strange stone metropolis Sam lies closer The
stone skyscrapers appear to be solid No windows No doors
Nothing whatsoever to interfere with their clean harsh
rectilinear design As he flies among these towering blocks
he sees no sign of the Girl only sheer walls rising high
above him Below him the walls plummet vertiginously into
the darkish streets No sound but the creaking flapping of
his wings can he heard in this dead place Coming round a
corner he sees something in the distance far below hima
dark procession is wending its way through the narrow
passages away from him

CUT TO
LOW ANGLE SHOT

Of the procession making its way past the CAMERA Black-
robed and cowled the sinister figures look like heavily
armed monks These are the FORCES OF DARKNESS Together

they are straining at several heavy hawsers that rise in
long arcs up to a huge metal cage floating above and behind
the procession Binding the cage are metal straps to which
ropes are attached Inside is the Girl still enveloped in
gossamer which billows as if there were a breeze in constant
attendance

CUT TO
SAM
As he dives out of shot

CUT TO
THE FORCES OF DARKNESS

Suddenly stopping in their tracks Theyve seen something

CUT TO
THEIR POV
There at the end of the passage between two stone
skyscrapers stands Sam barring the way

CUT TO

SWORDS BEING UNSHEATHED

Cowls being thrown back Underneath are rotting broken
dolls faces All the faces are the same except for the
manner in which they have decayed They smile slobbering
sickeningly Suddenly the robed bodies change shape some
rising up to become long others expanding sideways to
become bulbous others shrinking From the folds of cloth
come evil weapons The Forces are massed ready to charge
CUT TO LONG SHOT of Sam He removes his arms from his wings
and folds the wings behind him He is ready

CUT TO
THE FORCES
Nothing moves except for the
constant dribble from their cracked

mouths
CUT BACK TO SAM

Stillness The tension is unbearable Suddenly Sam unleashes
a terrifying scream and charges the fearsome horde Unarmed

CUT TO

THE FORCES
Thundering down to Sam Weapons
flailing madly

Sam skillfully dodges the swordthrust of the leading field
and karate chops him senseless at the same time catching
his sword as he falls Spinning around he parries a
spearthrust and skewers a third attacker Slash Hack
Stab He lays waste to the Forces Nothing can stop this
boy The pile of black-robed bodies grows with each swing
of Sams sword Wham Bam Smash Sam carves his way through
the mob with nary a scratch And then suddenly they are
all dead but a heap of blackness to commemorate Sams
prowess The Girl is beaming as Sam makes his way toward
the hawsers holding the cage But then a noise behind him
makes him turn There behind him the pile of black shapes
begin to rise The ropes become a mass of flapping black
cloth This evil churning cloud coalesces and lifts off

the ground The horrible flapping apparition emits a
terrifying maniacal laughter as it flies away Sam is about
to rush after it to halt its escape but is stopped by the
sound of a telephone ringing He looks around confused

INT SAMS BEDROOM - MORNING

TIGHT SHOT of telephone The ringing continues A hand
grapples with the receiver Sam is in bed in a darkened
room Sleepily he drags receiver to his ear

SAM
Hello What what Oh Mr
Kurtzman Youre up late Oh
is it

There is an electronic box of tricks by his bed
incorporating an alarm Sam thumps it The alarm goes off
This sets of a series of other things The window shutters
roll up letting in the morning light Both taps turn on in
the bathroom

SAM
(into phone)
The electronics here are up the
spout Yours too sir Dont worry
sir Ill be there

Sam puts down the phone and gets into his suit which is
moving towards him Noticing one of his film posters is
loose he pushes the pin in firmly

In the kitchen a coffee maker starts up In the sitting
room the television switches on Back in the bedroom a
cupboard door springs open and a rack slides out with Sams
clothes neatly hanging ready to be put on Sam comes out

of the bathroom having turned off the bath taps and starts
to get dressed In the kitchen the coffee- maker has
finished making s small pot of coffee Sam pours a quick
cup and is gone at the door Throughout all this we have
had a chance to get a glimpse of Sams flat It is
functional soulless and though neat has not been
assembled with a loving hand Most of the furnishings are
built in The walls are divided into two-foot square metal
panels painted a non-committal colour Certain of the wall
panels have Central Services logos on them with the
admonition Do not obstruct or remove below Sam has
livened his bedroom up with large and colorful film posters
The sitting room sports several framed pictures of wide
beautiful vistas

INT MINISTRY OF INFORMATION LOBBY - DAY

e lobby is a vast impressive space containing reception
esks fountains statues etc Prominent are the security
easures which include automatic mobile cameras video

SAM
You sound worried

JACK
Me if Im worried about anyone

Sam You were the brightest of us

As they have been talking a nearby bank of closed circuit
TV screens has been displaying shots of people entering

the lobby As each one enters the CAMERA ZOOMS IN TIGHT on
their faces for a frozen CLOSEUP Jill has just entered

and the CAMERA ZOOMS IN and freezes on her face Sam happens
to glance up at this moment He is startled the over-
exposed TV image is the face of the GIRL FROM THE DREAM

The face is only there a few seconds before being replaced
by another picture Sam looks about to see where the Girl
is but Jill in overalls has her back to him as she stands
in the queue for the Information desk and so there is no-
one even vaguely reminiscent of the Dream Girl Sam decides
he must have imagined it Over this Jack has been talking

JACK
Whats the matter

SAM
Sorry Nothing
(snapping out of it)
See you Im going to be late

JACK
(looking at his
watch)
You are late
SAM
Even later
JACK

to get noticed

SAM
Yes I know fantastic marvellous
wonderful remember me to Alison

JACK

SAM

Really God how time flies

As Sam heads off to the lift he passes a group of MEN
standing around a temporary TV monitor Several of them
are dressed in white lab coats They are being explained
the benefits of a new surveillance system by a salesman
type His assistant is operating the controls On the
monitor we can see Jill standing in the queue for the
Information desk The CAMERA appears to he tracking in on
her

CUT TO
JILL

At top of queue with several forms in her hand A strange
prototype radio controlled camera on a wheeled base is
whirring and clicking as it approaches her Throughout the
next sequence it pokes around Jill in an annoying manner
thrusting itself at her face trying to see what is written
on the forms peering over her shoulder Jill hands a form
to the Information Porter

JILL
I want to report a wrongful arrest

PORTER
(looking at form)
You want Information Adjustments
Different department

JILL
(exasperated but
controlled)
Ive been to Information
Adjustments They sent me here
They told me you had a form I had
to fill in

PORTER

JILL
Yes

PORTER
Is it stamped

JILL
(producing Buttle
receipt)
Stamped

PORTER
(examining receipt)
No theres no stamp on it You
see I cant give you the form
until its stamped

JILL
Where do I get it stamped

PORTER
Information Adjustments

The radio-controlled camera noses right up to Jills face
as she turns She swats the annoying thing with her stack
of forms as she storms off The camera overbalances and
crashes into the desk sparking and spluttering
CUTTING BACK TO THE GROUP AROUND THE MONITOR

We see a deeply hurt SALESMAN and several sceptical white-
coated TECHNICIANS

INT MR KURTZMANS OFFICE - DAY

Sam is busily working at the console unraveling a problem
while Kurtzman looks on anxiously and ineffectually

KURTZMAN

INT DOCTORS OFFICE DAY

CUT TO AN OLD WOMANS FACE

Reflected in triplicate in
of MANs hands have a grip
them out several inches on

a three-panelled mirror A pair
on her flabby cheeks pulling
either side of her face When I

say several inches thats just what I mean Not only are
her jowls being stretched like silly putty but they are
also being wrapped around to the back of her neck to
demonstrate how tight and smooth her face can be made by
DOCTOR who is prattling on over this freak show

DOCTOR
Now when you come in tomorrow
Mrs Lowry well make a little

tuck here and there
CUT TO

WIDE SHOT OF DOCTORS SURGERY
It looks a bit like a cross between an operating theatre
and a boudoir The cold steel glass and plastic surfaces
are badly disguised with pastel coloured chintz and satin
At the dressing table sits the old woman SAMS MOTHER
Behind her stands the Doctor He is much like his surgery
He has tailored his surgical garments like a gigolos
dressing gown It seems that he has done a bit of tuck-
taking on himself There is a certain plastic smoothness
to his skin but all in all he has been fairly successful
Sam is pacing around raving

SAM
(angrily)
I just wish you would stop
interfering mother I dont want
promotion Im happy where I am

MOTHER
No youre not Jack Lint is a lesson
to you he never had your brains
but hes got the ambition You
havent got the ambition but luckily
youve got me And Mr Helpmann
Mr Helpmann was very close

DOCTOR
Now Mrs Lowry dont get upset

Please wait in reception Mr Lowry

MOTHER

Sam groans

DOCTOR

years younger

SAM

DOCTOR
(giving Sam a dirty
look)

the excess fluid from the pouches

MOTHER
Dr Jaffe youre a genius Would
you like to be Surgeon General
Four Star I know everybody

DOCTOR
Well they wont know you when Ive
finished with you

The Doctor reaches into his smock pocket for a coloured
marker He starts colouring up her face with strokes of
different coloured markers

DOCTOR
First we must eliminate the excess
derma so Then the flaccid
tissues under the eyes And now
the forehead Zip I lift the
wrinkles and worry lines right up
into the wi into the hairline
comme ca

Sam looks disgusted

DOCTOR
And now the template There
there there Now a bit of
sticky There we go
(triumphantly)

Already she is twice as beautiful
as she was before voila

The Doctor moves his body aside revealing Mrs Lowrys
face covered with coloured lines and wrapped in cellophane
held in shape by cellotape Sam stares at her

SAM
My God it works

INT POSH RESTAURANT (ENTRANCE) - DAY

The conversation between Sam and his Mother takes place
while they are going through the sort of security checks
familiar at airports They are however just outside the
velvet rope of the posh restaurant

MOTHER

(in full flow)
Mr Helpmann was very close to
your poor father He was very close
to me Still is Hell take you
under his wing at Information
Retrieval Youll like it when you
get there

SAM
Youre not listening mother

A warning buzzer goes off as Mothers handbag goes thru
security check It turns out to have been activated by a
gaily wrapped package A SECURITY GUARD relieves her of it
and unwraps the package which contains the same kind of
executive toy which we have seen twice before
MOTHER
Its a present for my son

She takes the toy back and hands it to Sam

MOTHER
I hope you like it Its very
exclusive

SAM

What is it

MOTHER
Its something for executives

At this point the MAITRED arrives on the scene

MAITRED
Madam Lowry how exquisite to see
you again Merry Christmas

He pulls aside he velvet rope with a grand flourish He
looks disdainfully at Sams unfashionable clerks suite

MOTHER
Hello Spiro Merry Christmas

SPIRO
(blocking Sams way)
Im sorry but

MOTHER
You remember Samuel my son

SPIRO
(suddenly unctious)
Oh but of course

MOTHER
Were meeting Mrs Terrain

SAM
Are we

SPIRO
Ah yes the lady is waiting

Spiro leads the way Sam and his Mother follow across the
restaurant which is much like the Palm Court at the Plaza
New York Trellises marble columns antique mirroring
potted palms combine to impress us with their sophistication
and taste A string quartet can just be made out against

the far wall Except for the unfortunate intrusion of metal
tubing and ducting brutally thrusting across areas of the
ceiling occasionally penetrating right through the middle
of a particularly valuable- looking mirror the general
effect is one of confident wealth and breeding Sam Mother
and Maitred make their way across the room The waltzing
strains of the string quartet accompanying them

CUT TO
GROUP OF TABLES WITH DINERS

At one of them sits a wealthy-looking OLDER WOMAN with a
rather plain-looking DAUGHTER in her 20s The Older Woman
is easily distinguished from the other clientele by a large
bandage that covers a goodish part of her head The two of
them (the Mother and Daughter not the Mother and bandage)
are perusing the menus Sam notes the Daughter unpleased

SAM
Mother I thought we were going to
be able to talk Oh God shes

got whats he name with her
Sam and his Mother arrive at the table

MRS TERRAIN

MOTHER

(to Sam and Mother)
Happy Christmas Sam

She hands Sam a gaily wrapped package which obviously
contains the same executive toy

MOTHER
Sorry were late Shall we order
Get it out of the way What are
you going to have Alma

She starts to hunt through the huge menu the Maitred has
just handed her with full colour photos of the splendid
dishes available

MRS TERRAIN
I cant make up my mind whether to
have a number one or a number two
What do you recommend Spiro

SPIRO
(conspiratorially)
Between you and me Madam today

MRS TERRAIN

SPIRO
(conspiratorially)

Mother I need to

SPIRO
(piqued)
Monsieur Quel numero

SAM
(handing back menu)
I dont know which numero

SPIRO
(writing on pad)
Numero trois

Everyone is a bit embarrassed here Mother gives Sam a
withering look Spiro stalks away

MOTHER
(trying to restart
things)
Alma you wicked thing
(indicating bandages)
youve started your treatment

MRS TERRAIN
You noticed
(enthusiastically)
I must tell you all about it
SAM

(to his mother)
Mother will you listen to At this
moment the food arrives Spiro
elaborately lifts off the silver
covers and with a flourish
distributes the plates of food
Each order looks identical a big
splodge of brown lumpy stuff The
only differences between the lumps
are the Identifying photographs on
sticks stuck in each The beautiful
colour photos match the photos
which were on the menus

SPIRO

(showing off that

he remembers whos

ordered what)
Numero huit braised veal in wine
sauce

of Sams Mother)

MRS TERRAIN

Jaffe and gone to Dr Chapman

SPIRO

of Mrs Terrain)

MOTHER
The acid man

MRS TERRAIN

techniques are revolutionary I
dont go around calling Dr Jaffe
the knife man

SPIRO
Numero une crevettes a la
mayonaaise
(he sets it in front
of Shirley)

MOTHER

sound so

MRS TERRAIN

that hes such an artist To him
cutting is so crude so primitive
SPIRO
Numero trois steak
(he sets this in
front of Sam)
Monsieur Mesdames Bon appetit

ALL BUT SAM
Merci

MRS TERRAIN
Acid on the other hand can be
used for such wonderfully subtle
shading such delicate nuances
just like a Rembrant etching
and its so much quicker Why if
it werent for a teensy-weensy
complication the doctor said it
could have happened to anyone I
would have had these bandages off
yesterday

SHIRLEY
(to Sam after
attracting her
mothers attention
and receiving a
nod)
Salt

They are just about to dip into their respective splodges
when there is a terrific explosion a huge hole is blasted
out of the wall to the kitchen Chaos erupts around the
carnage as WAITERS try putting out the flames with
extinguishers PEOPLE bloody and dying are moaning The
DINERS not actually affected by the blast look up for a
moment and then with a few raised eyebrows go back to
their meals

IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE EXPLOSION

MOTHER
What were we saying

SAM
(picking bomb debris
out of his brown
lump)
This isnt rare

MOTHER
By the way I saw a wonderful idea
for Christmas presents at the
chemists Gift tokens Medical
gift tokens

MRS TERRAIN
Oh that sounds marvellous

MOTHER
Yes theyre good at any doctors
and at many of the major hospitals
and theyre accepted for
gynecological complications
including Caesarian section

Sam in the act of taking in another forkful of his
unappetising meal drops his form in disgust

SAM
Look please Im sorry but
honestly mother this is MOTHER

I quite agree Its impossible

Mother raises her arm to gain the attention of the Maitred
who is frantically trying to deal with the emergency The
activity in the background has increased throughout the
conversation The fire-brigade has arrived with sirens
blaring Ministry TROOPS have charged in and are arresting
WAITERS Stretchers have been bought in for the injured

and these are being rushed past our little groups table
The Maitred comes to the table his DJ now blood-spattered

MAITRED
I am sorry Madam I dont know
what to say this very rarely

happens to us’ Ill do what I can
straight away He hurries away

MRS TERRAIN
Really Sam when are you going to
do something about these terrorists

SAM
What Now Its my lunch hour

MOTHER
Actually Alma thats one of the
little things I was dying to tell
you Sams been promoted to
Information Retrieval

SAM
(angry and surprised)
Mother

MRS TERRAIN
Oh thats wonderful Congratulations
Sam

SHIRLEY
You can show those fucking murderous
bastards a thing or two
MRS TERRAIN
(shocked and
embarrassed)
Shirley

SAM
Stop this
(leaping to his
feet)
Im not being promoted Im not
going to Information Retrieval
(he scrumples
promotion
notification which
he has been holding
and throws it on
the floor)
If I want you to stick your oar
in mother Ill tell you where to
stick it

Everybody is shocked He recovers his composure slightly
Embarrassed he bends and picks up the ball of paper which
he starts smoothing back into Its flat state

SHIRLEY
(back to her
uncertain form)
Pepper

SAM

Look Ive got to get back As Sam
goes Maitred reappears with a
group of WAITERS those remaining
unarrested whom he has organised
to gut up a folding screen around
the table This cuts of the sight
if not the noise of the victims of
the explosion

MOTHER
Sam you havent had dessert

SAM
Im sorry I don t want dessert
I dont want promotion I dont
want anything

MOTHER
Dont be childish Samuel Of course
you want something You must have
hopes wishes dreams

Their voices have been rising towards a shout in order to
rise above the volume of the growing chaos around them
SAM
(shouts loud)
NO NOTHING NOT EVEN DREAMS

EXT BRILLIANT SKY - DAY

Sam as his dream-self rises INTO SHOT his wings straining
as he tows the floating cage imprisoning the girl They

are rising up and away from the monolithic stone skyscrapers
that stretch away below them

SAM
Im taking you to a safe place A
place where they will never be
able to get at us ever

An eyeball is scanning the sky PULLING BACK we see it is
but one of thousands tightly packed side by side forming
a landscape that extends as far as we can see As Sam and
the girl in her cage come into view it becomes apparent
just how big these eyeballs are they are gigantic about
10 feet in diameter All of them follow Sam as he comes to
rest on a platform high atop a column that rises from the
centre of this bizarre place

SAM
Theres no way they can approach
us without being seen Youre safe
here

He anchors the hawser holding the cage and takes off his
wings Just as he starts climbing up to the cage a terrific
cracking noise is heard Sam freezes

A dead straight crack is bisecting the sky from somewhere
beyond the horizon running right up the sky and over the
camera Sam follows it as it continues over the Girl and
down to the opposite horizon Another crackling noise is
heard Another crack appears Then another And another
All these cracks are emanating from a vanishing point over
the horizon Soon the sky is covered with these cracks
from horizon to foreground Then cracks begin appearing at
right angles to them Very quickly the sky is covered with
a mammoth grid Once it is complete another noise is heard
Something like massive blocks of stone sliding against one
another One of the squares formed by the grid pattern
begins to slide upwards as if being pulled out from the
back side of the sky A square hole is left in its place
We can see the sides of the hole as it extends upwards
into blackness As soon as this first block of sky is
withdrawn another begins to slide up and away Sam is
frozen in position as this terrifying spectacle goes on
above him The eyeballs are madly looking this way and
that The grinding noises are deafening as block after
block of sky is removed With each successive loss the
light decreases The Girl is crying out for Sam to save
her Frantically Sam tries to haul the cage down to the

platform but its too late Where the sky was is now pitch
black Only one block of sky remains Slowly that final

bit of sky is pulled up and out of shot Total blackness

A maniacal laughter can be heard A beam of light is
switched on Sam has a searchlight in his hand and is
searching the darkness The laughter continues Suddenly

the beam catches something black and moving its the same
black flapping cloth that appeared at the end of the
previous dream The horrible flapping thing comes thundering
down on Sam He is engulfed in the black awfulness

INT SAMS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Sam is in bed grappling with the bedclothes He is dripping
with sweat and screaming The room is oppressively hot He
gets up and looks at the thermostat It reads 99 He fumbles
with it but to no avail Its stuck

CUT TO
SAM

Coming into the sitting room He rushes over to the window
and tries to open it But it wasnt designed to be opened
Screws hold it firmly shut Sam heads to the kitchen He
finds a knife which he uses to unscrew the window He swings
the window open and takes a deep breath GAG COUGH HACK
A terrible greeny-brown smog pours in through the window
Desperately Sam shuts the window and madly tightens up the
screws Swinging a newspaper he tries clearing a path
through the clouded atmosphere He makes it to the front
door and staggers out into the hall gasping for air CUT
TO telephone being lifted from its cradle Pull back as
Sam with opened telephone directory in front of him dials
He is seated in his kitchen In front of his open
refrigerator The phone rings at the other end

SAM

(into phone)
Hello Central Services Im at
579B Block 19 Northwestern Section
D thats exit 1 on Green Pastures
Highway at the Orange Blossom
Flyover and Ive got trouble with
the air- conditioning

PHONE VOICE
Thank you or calling Central

staff shortage Central Services

recording incident-

SAM
This is an emergency
PHONE VOICE
Thank you for calling Central
Services I am sorry due

SAM
Yes but Ive got to have a heating
engineer

PHONE VOICE
Thank you for calling Cen

Sam slams the phone down
CUT TO
SAM

Sitting in front of the refrigerator The door is open and
he has wedged a chair into the gap in a desperate bid to
keep cool He is nodding off As his head slumps against
one of the shelves a jar of pickled onions falls to the
floor The onions scattering everywhere

EXT DARKNESS - NIGHT

The milky white spheres tumble everywhere But they are

not onions they are the giant eyeballs burtling through
space Sam is clinging desperately to one He grabs the
pupil for a better handhold and it opens like a hatch cover
Sam manages to pull himself inside Once out of the
intergalactic maelstrom Sam turns to survey the cramped
and dark space inside the eyeball It seems to be bisected
by a dividing wall from which a thin sliver of light is
escaping Pushing on the wall in the area of the slit Sam
is able to move a section More light shaftes into the

tiny space from around the edges of what appears to be a
small hatch Sam scrunches down and really puts his shoulder
to the hatch with a metallic rasp it gives way and Sam
crashes through

CUT TO
OTHER SIDE OF OPENING

As Sam topples through He catches himself in the nick of
time as the camera zooms back revealing his close call

with disaster He is high on a vast wall of what looks

like filing cabinets The hatch he came through was the
front of one of the millions of files-drawers composing

this wall As he scrambles back into the opening we can

see that the wall drops away for hundreds of feet disappear
into a steaming mist Other walls of files enclose this

vast space From where Sam is it looks like the view from
the 50th storey of the Time Life building in NYC These
millions of files are being tended by MEN arising themselves
up and down as well as sideways on modern skyscraper
window-cleaners platforms The attendants are seen putting
PEOPLE in different period costumes into drawers Sams
attention is distracted by a sound overhead Looking up he
sees a window washer platform being lowered in his
direction Leaning over the side is a JOLLY GENT who
happens to look like Mr Helpmann (as seen on TV)

GENT
Ah ha there you are Sam

SAM
What How do you know my name

GENT
We know everything here This is
the Storeroom of Knowledge

SAM
(climbing onto the
platform)
Then perhaps you can help me Ive
lost someone who

GENT
(interrupting)
We know that too Youve come to
the right place

The platform carries them along the files

GENT

Oh yes Weve got everything here
Every bit of knowledge wisdom
learning every experience every
thought neatly filed away

SAM
(incredulous)
What You mean youve got

GENT
Well not exactly But if you help
us well help you The Forces Of
Darkness have won the day but
tomorrow is another one

SAM
What do I have to do

GENT
You must save the day

The platform has stopped The Gent pulls out a drawer He
reaches inside

The Gent pulls out a wonderful sword and helmet
GENT
This is the Sword Of Truth and
this the Helmet Of Justice

As Sam begins to strap on the weapon the Gent brings out a
cape

GENT
And this completes the outfit

He puts the cape around Sams shoulders and helps him step
into the drawer A moments hesitation and then Sam outs
the helmet on and lies down in the drawer It fits just
like a coffin As he lies back the Gent pushes the drawer
in

GENT
It wont be pleasant but trust
me

As the drawer is pushed in Sam suffers a sudden bout of
claustrophobia Looking up at the diminishing opening he
is surprised to see not the face of the Jolly Gent but a
terrifying SAMURAI WARRIORS MASKED HELMET Sam struggles
to prevent the drawer being closed

INT SAMS FLAT - NIGHT

Sam is grabbing the walls of the fridge Water from the
defrosted freezer compartment drips on his head He wakes
up Before he can really take in where he is the phone
rings He staggers over to it

SAM
Hello hello

PHONE VOICE
Hello Mr Lowry

SAM

Whos that

(pause)
A sound at the kitchen door turns
Sams head and ours just in time
to half see a quick blurred
movement but then a rapid voice
in his ear-piece brings his head
back

PHONE VOICE
Put the phone down and your hands
up

SAM
(into the phone)
What Who is this
Sam realises that the voice is also in the room behind
him He turns round and sees TUTTLE Tuttle is middle-aged
a short tough figure dressed in dark clothes suggesting a
cross between a cat burglar and a night-raid commando In
one hand he holds a gun pointed at Sam The other hand is
holding a telephone receiver which Tuttle is in the act of
placing in the large capacious bag at his feet Sam puts
down his phone and his hands up

TUTTLE
Nice and easy now Keep your hands
where I can see them

SAM
What is this
(indignantly)
Who the hell are you

Tuttle keeping the gun on Sam goes to different doors
leaning backwards into bedroom bathroom and closet

Tuttle suddenly relaxes and pockets his gun

TUTTLE
Harry Tuttle Heating engineer At
your service

SAM
Tuttle Are you from Central
Services

TUTTLE

Ha
SAM

But I called Central Services
TUTTLE

Theyre a bit overworked these
days Luckily I intercepted your
call

SAM
What

By now both are pouring with sweat Tuttle heads across
the room and swiftly begins to undo a wall panel

SAM
Wait a minute what was that
business with the gun

Tuttle hands Sam the panel and plunges his arm into the
space behind it

TUTTLE
A little precaution sir Ive had
traps set for me before now There
are people in Central Services
whod love to get their hands on
Harry Tuttle

SAM
Are you saying this is illegal

By now Tuttle has managed to pull out some sections of
flexible ducting from the welter of mechanical offal behind
the removed panel It is all very complicated and greasy
and it looks as though there is a lot more where that came
from Tuttle is amazingly neat and deft as he works A

real pro As he works he hums a wee tune yes
BRAZIL
TUTTLE
Well yes and no Officially

only Central Service operatives
are supposed to touch this stuff
Could you hold these

(he hands Sam a

bunch of wires

that he has detached)
but with all the new rules
and regulations unncgh cmon
cmon they cant get decent
staff any more so they tend
to turn a blind eye as long as
Im careful

(he hands Sam a

torch)
Mind you if ever they could
prove Id been working on their
equipment well thats a
different matter up a bit with
the torch sir

SAM
Sorry wouldnt it be easier just
to work for Central Services

TUTTLE
Couldnt stand the pa Ah were
getting warm

SAM
The pace

TUTTLE

The paperwork couldnt stand the
paperwork

(indicating the

torch)
Over to the left please if you
dont mind sir Hold it there
Yes theres more bits of paper in
Central Services than bits of pipe
read this fill in that hand in
the other listen this old system
of yours could be on fire and I
couldnt even turn on the kitchen
tap without filling in a 27B6
Bloody paperwork

SAM
(mildly)
Well I suppose one has to expect a
certain amount

TUTTLE

Why I came into this game for
adventure go anywhere travel light
get in get out wherever theres
trouble a man alone Now theyve
got the whole country sectioned of
and you cant move without a form
Im the last of a breed Ah ha
Found it

(he holds up a small

charred gadget)
Theres your problem

SAM
Can you fix it

TUTTLE
No But I can bypass it with one
of these

He pulls another gadget from his bag

SAM
Fine

The door bell Tuttle grabs for his gun

TUTTLE
Are you expecting anyone

SAM
No Wait here

He goes out closing the immediate door and goes to the

front door which he opens He is confronted by two officious
little men in boiler suits who are standing outside his
door Their names are SPOOR and DOWSER Dowser is Spoors
echo

SAM
Yes

SPOOR
Central Services
DOWSER

SAM
Uh what I

SPOOR

SAM
Look Im sorry about your wasted
journey
Sam tries to close the door but Spoor prevents this

SPOOR
(to Dowser)
I think wed better have a look

DOWSER
- have a look

SAM
No you cant

He is pushed aside Spoor followed by Dowser heads for
the door behind which is Mr Tuttle Sam is paralysed
Spoor approaches the door as if it is dangerous He turns
the handle quietly and gives the door a little nudge The
door begins to swing slowly open Sam suddenly finds
inspiration

SAM
Just a minute

Spoor and Dowser turn round as the door continues to swing
open When the door is open behind their backs Tuttle is
seen holding his pistol in a two-handed grip his knees
slightly bent Tuttle freezes like that pointing his pistol
through the open door

SAM
Have you got a 27B6

Dowser looks very angry Veins stand out on his forehead
and he goes into what looks like some sort of fit Spoor
knocks him to the ground

SPOOR
(to Sam)
Now look what youve done to him

SAM
Have you got one or havent you

SPOOR
Not as such

Dowser moans and begins to get back on his feet

SPOOR
But we can get one
(worried about Dowser)
Its all right Terry its all
right everythings all right

SAM
(ushering them to
the door)
Im sorry but Ima bit of a
stickler for paper work Where
would we be if we didnt follow
the correct procedures

SPOOR
Well be back

DOWSER
Be back

SAM
(closing the door
on them)
Thank you

Sam turns back to Tuttle who is coming forward pocketing
his gun

TUTTLE
Thanks Lowry youre a good man
in a tight corner

Tuttle returns to work fitting in the new by-pass gadget
and tightening the nuts and happily humming BRAZIL

SAM
Listen um I dont want to
get involved in any of this But I
work at the Ministry of Information
and I happen to know that
Information Retrieval have been
looking for an Archibald Tuttle
Heating Engineer You wouldnt by
any chance be

TUTTLE
(pleased)
My friends call me Harry
Information Retrieval eh
Interesting

SAM
What do they want you or

TUTTLE
Time to go

Tuttle finishes the job and throws his tools into the bag

SAM
Thank you very much How much will
it

TUTTLE

On the house You did me a favor
Check the corridor
Sam goes to the front door opens it and looks out

SAM
All clear

Tuttle slips out and heads off down the balcony corridor

SAM
Hey thats a dead end

But Tuttle merely undoes a pre-arranged rope and swings
Tarzan-like off the end of the balcony and across a multi-
story void to a neighboring block Sam is amazed not to
say stunned

INT RECORDS POOL - DAY

Sam is at his desk among all the desks Documents are being
delivered right left and centre through the vacuum tubes
All the CLERKS are busy The screens are devoted to their
proper use All this activity is explained by the fact the
Mr Kurtzmans door is wide open At the next desk is
another Clerk much like Sam his Neighbour

NEIGHBOUR
I think Kurtzman getting is
suspicious

SAM

What have we got on today

NEIGHBOUR
Casablanca

Kurtzman appears in his doorway

KURTZMAN
(calls out)
Mr Lowry Would you step in here
a moment please

We go with Kurtzman as he closes the office door behind
him we are now in

INT KURTZMANS OFFICE - DAY

Kurtzman is pacing anxiously Sam walks into the office
During the brief opening and closing of the door we just
manage to hear the piano player in Casablanca singing
a kiss is just a kiss Kurtzman is too worried to
notice He is holding a piece of paper gingerly as if it
were contagious He waves it frantically as Sam enters

KURTZMAN
(hysterically)
Thank God youre here Were in
terrible trouble Look at this
Look at this

He thrusts the piece of paper at Sam

SAM
(taking the paper)
A cheque
KURTZMAN

The refund for Tuttle

SAM
(startled)
Tuttle
KURTZMAN

I mean Buttle Its been confusion
from the word go Hes been wrongly
charged for Electromemorytherapy

and someone somewhere is trying to
make us carry the can

SAM
Ive never seen a Ministry cheque
before

KURTZMAN

Weve got to get rid of it Theres
been a balls-up somewhere and

when the music stops theyll jump

on whoevers holding the cheque

SAM
Send it to somebody else Send it
to Buttle Its his cheque

KURTZMAN
Ive tried that Population Census
have got him down as dormanted
the Central Collective Storehouse
computer has got him down as
deleted and the Information
Retrieval have got him down as
inoperative Security has him
down as excised Admin have him
down as completed

SAM
Hang on

Sam sits down at the console and punches keys He does
this very efficiently muttering to himself and generally
demonstrating an expertise which obviously leaves Kurtzman
way out of his depth until

SAM
He is dead
KURTZMAN
Dead Oh no Thats terrible Well
never get rid of the damned thing
What are we going to do

SAM
Try next of kin

KURTZMAN
(a revelation)
Next of kin

Sam punches more keys
SAM
There we go Mrs Veronica Buttle
Whats the number on the cheque
KURTZMAN
(reading it)

27156789074328K

Sam has been efficiently punching this in

SAM
Into memory Now Central
Banking Buttle Veronica

Deposit Sam rips off a print out
rapidly stuffs it and the cheque
into a cannister and then into a
vacuum tube A job well done

KURTZMAN
(fervently)
Please dont come back Please
dont come back

Unfortunately Kurtzmans prayers are not answered and the
vacuum tube returns almost immediately Sam opens it up
From the computer screen comes a voice Play it again
Sam Sam and Kurtzman look at the screen We get a quick
glimpse of Humphrey Bogart before the screen reverts to
numbers

SAM
Problem She doesnt have a bank
account
KURTZMAN
(hysterically)

Well thats it I may as well go
and hang myself This sort of thing
couldnt have happened before the
stupid seventh tier reorganization
That was Simmons doing And he and
Jeffries always sit together at
lunch The bastards
(he thumps his hand
hard on the desk

top)
ow

(he picks up the

offending cheque)
Perhaps we can lose it behind
the filing cabinet or destroy
it burn it eat it

Under this tirade Sam has begun to hum BRAZIL not
entirely sure what inspired him

SAM
Youd never get away with it
Besides you cant do that to
somebodys refund Its Christmas
There is one more option

KURTZMAN
(depressed not
really believing
it)
What

SAM
Drive out to Mrs Buttle give her
the cheque tell her to sign her
name on the back cash it at the
corner sweet shop

Kurtzman is dumbfounded by the audacity of this

KURTZMAN
Thats brilliant

Sam takes over In no time at all he has battered away at
the keyboard slammed a cannister into a vacuum tube and
received almost immediately a cannister containing a sheaf
of different coloured papers

SAM
Ill do it for you Authorise the
cheque Whats the address

Kurtzman scribbles it down for him

KURTZMAN
Here What do I do next

SAM
Call the motor pool and authorise
personal transport

KURTZMAN
Of course of course Leave it to
me How do I authorize a cheque

SAM
(separating the and
blue sheets)
Here we are Pink and blue receipts
All youve got to do is sign these
and the back of the cheque

Kurtzman takes out his pen and tries to sign the papers
but his hand is giving him trouble

KURTZMAN
(exhausted after
all the emotion)
Oh God I think Ive broken a bone
What a pathetic thing I am

SAM
(taking the pen
from him)
Here

Sam signs the cheque and receipts A big CLOSEUP shows
that he is scribbling Kurtzmans signature Sam pockets
the papers and the pen

SAM
Thats it

KURTZMAN
You are good to me Sam

SAM
(leaving)
Dont mention it See you later

EXT MOTORWAY TUNNEL - DAY

CUT TO Sam at the wheel of the little car beetling along
in a seemingly endless tube-like tunnel menaced fore and
aft by huge buses lorries and other carriers which
literally lift the little three-wheeler from the road
surface and shake it by the scruff of its tiny neck

CUT TO Sam in interior of the Messerschmidt He is singing
along to an obscure arrangement of BRAZIL

moment which then

fades out)

EXT BUTTLE FLATS - DAY

Beautiful utopian block of high-rise flats gleam in the
sunlight Pulling back we reveal it to be an architects
model in a protective perspex case standing in the centre
of a decorative fountain that has long ceased to work
graffiti and junk are now the only decorations In the
background is the grim reality of the massive housing tower
Sams Messerschmidt is just puling up in the shadow of the
building which is grey decrepid vandalised Huge conduits
pipes and tubing frame the scene Sam gets out of the car
under the cool and none-too-friendly gaze of a few LOCALS
Self-consciously Sam looks around him then at the paper
in his hand A little group of KIDS sit pitching pennies
against a wall Sam goes over to them

SAM
(super polite)
Excuse me Can you tell me

But before he can finish the smallest tiny KID looks up

KID
Eff off

Sam uncomfortably effs off

He is watched at some distance imapassively by the little
Girl Butttle As Sam enters the buildings one of the kids
gets out a can of something and approaches the car Another
is fiddling with a box of matches

INT BUTTLE FLATS - DAY

CUT TO Sam hesitantly walking into the semi-derelict lobby
of the big block of flats Graffiti vandalism are in
evidence everywhere He walks up to the lift Pushes the
button Nothing happens He pushes again This time the
lift door shudders and sparks Sam tries to pull the doors
apart They jam open with a three-inch gap between them
still shuddering and grinding In the sparking light Sam
can make out an interior crammed with garbage junk old
furniture dead cats Yechhhh Resignedly he turns towards
the stairs

INT CORRIDOR - DAY

CUT TO Sam coming breathlessly out of the stairwell On
the wall next to it is the number 37 Walking down the
corridor he looks at the number and starts to knock but
then notices that the door is cracked open Sam tries to
knock on the door but it keeps edging open and he settles
for knocking on the door frame a bit feebly

SAM
Mrs Buttle
(silence)
Uh Mrs Buttle
(silence)

Sam stands not knowing what to do
Sam pushes the door a bit more
open gingerly and puts about 65
per cent of his body into the hall
of the flat CUT TO SAMS POV of
darkish hall Mrs Buttle

INT BUTTLE SITTING ROOM - DAY

CUT TO Sam entering extremely tacky sitting-room shrouded
in half-darkness This is the same flat from which the
FATHER was taken at the beginning of the film the hole is
still in the ceiling Sam becomes aware of a woman sitting
absolutely still at a small table by the only (still broken)
window in the room

SAM
Are you Mrs Buttle

The woman nods very slightly without looking at him

SAM
My name is Lowry Sam Lowry Im
from the Ministry of Information
(no response)
Ive come to give you a cheque

Sam takes the cheque out of his pocket and puts it on the
table to tempt Mrs Buttle into a flicker of interest but
she fails to notice it or him for that matter Sam pushes
the cheque a little way towards Mrs Buttle but she does
not respond

SAM
(indicting cheque)
Its a refund Im afraid there

was a mistake
MRS BUTTLE

Mistake
SAM
(encouraged)
Yes Not my department Im only

records It seems that Mr Buttle
was overcharged by Information
Retrieval I dont think they
usually make mistakes but er
I suppose were all human

Sam looks around and sees the hole in the ceiling

SAM
Oh what happened to the

He gets nothing back

Actually my bringing this here is rather unorthodox
Usually any payments are made through the central
computer but er there were certain difficulties

and rather than cause delay we thought you might appreciate
this now it being Christmas

MRS BUTTLE
My husbands dead isnt he

SAM

Er I assure you Mrs Buttle
the Ministry is always very
scrupulous about following up and
eradicating error If you have any
complaints which youd like to
make Id be more than happy to
send you the appropriate forms

MRS BUTTLE
What have you done with his body

SAM
Um

Mrs Buttle starts to cry

SAM

Look Im very sorry but Im afraid
I dont know anything about it
Im really just delivering the
cheque Er If you wouldnt mind
signing these receipts

(producing blue and

pink receipts)
Ill go and leave you in peace

Sam picks up the cheque and gives it to Mrs Buttle together
with the receipts Mrs Buttle tears them up and throws
them in his face

SAM
Uh

MRS BUTTLE
He hadnt done anything He was
good What have you done with
his body

Sam looks around for an escape and sees a Young Buttle
standing in the doorway The Boy is looking at him with a
blank tearful face Suddenly the Boy launches himself at
Sam with terrible ferocity Sam is knocked against the
wall A mirror falls off the wall and smashes on the floor
The Boy is all over Sam kicking and pulling his hair Mrs
Buttles reaction however is to try and pull the Boy
away from Sam By the time she succeeds Sam is on his
hands and knees in pain The Boy is crying and shouting
and Mrs Buttle is loudly trying to quieten the Boy From
SAMS POV a piece of broken mirror lying on the floor
reflects the hole in the ceiling with Jills head and
shoulders framed in the hole The moment is unreal for Sam
in his dazed condition The vision seems unreal too Jill
is staring at Sam out of the piece of mirror and shes
very much the Girl from his dream now

JILL
Are you alright

SAM
(mumbles)
Its you its you
JILL

Mrs Buttle are you alright

Sam grabs at the image ie at the mirror shifting the
angle so that the vision disappears He looks for the vision
on the floor but cant find it Then he begins to realise
the reality of what he has seen He stands up dazed and
battered Mrs Buttle has been looking up at the ceiling
Sam looks up at the ceiling but there is now only the empty
space of the hole

SAM
Wait Stop Come back

Mrs Buttle is shouting Sam rushes out of the flat
INT BUTTLES CORRIDOR - DAY
Sam looks both ways and heads for the stairs

INT BUTTLES STAIRCASE - DAY
Sam runs up the stairs to the floor above and finds himself
in

EXT SIMILAR CORRIDOR - DAY

He runs along the corridor but has omitted to count the
doors downstairs and now doesnt know which door to knock
at He hesitates He rings the bell on what he hopes is
the right door The bell doesnt work He bangs on the
door The door opens a crack A malevolent eye looks at
him

SAM
Girl fair hair

The door shuts firmly Sam rushes to the next door
INT JILLS FLAT - DAY

Sam bursts into Jills flat He sees the hole in the floor
The place looks derelict He hears an explosion and looks
out of a window to see his car in flames Jill is apparently
retreating from it across the forecourt She is carrying a
suitcase and bundles

INT STAIRCASE - DAY
Sam rushes down the stairs
EXT BLOCK OF FLATS - DAY

Sam charges out into the open air Jill has disappeared
The Messerchmidt however is in flames Sam doesnt know
which way to turn Spotting an old mattress lying by the
building he grabs it and throws it over the car in an
attempt to smother the flames The group of CHILDREN watch
him silently Suddenly with a great roar Jills lorry
comes round the corner at speed Sam sees that Jill is at
the wheel Sam runs after the lorry

SAM
(shouting)
Wait It was nothing to do with
me

The lorry roars away Sam dashes back to his smoldering
three-wheeler He flings himself into it and starts it up
He also roars away except that he doesnt move all
three wheels have been removed He turns round in despair
and sees the group of children regarding him
expressionlessly

They include the little Girl Buttle
Defeated he slumps down against his charred vehicle A

shadow passes across his face Looking up he sees Girl
Buttle standing over him

SAM
Go away

GIRL BUTTLE
Her name is Jill

SAM
What Jill Jill who Jill who

GIRL BUTTLE
Layton

SAM
Jill Layton
(getting up)
Youre a very good little girl
What are you doing here

GIRL BUTTLE
Im waiting for my daddy

SAM
(uncomprehending)
He will be pleased when he comes
home

Girl Buttle doesnt answer and Sam starts to walk away
After a few yards the thought strikes him he turns back

to look at the little Girl Buttle who stands alone patiently
in the vandalised wilderness

INT RECORD CLERKS POOL - DAY

It is the end of the work day The Clerks are busily getting
their coats and leaving the office As the last one goes

Mr Kurtzman comes out of his private office with his hat
and coat on He turns out the office light He sees Sam
isolated in the empty room still working at his computer
console Totally absorbed in what he is doing

KURTZMAN
Oh Sam Ive had the transport
pool onto me You dont know

anything about a personnel
transporter gone missing do you

Sam doesnt seem to hear him On the computer screen is a
front and side view picture of Jill Her name and code
number is at the top of the screen Sam is punching up

personal dossier information like age height weight
colour of hair colour of eyes distinguishing marks
etc
SAM
(preoccupied)

A personnel transporter Theyve
got it wrong I had a personal
transporter Ill do the paperwork
tomorrow Sam punches up a few more
categories for Jills dossier

KURTZMAN
Is it all right about Mrs Buttles
cheque

SAM

I delivered it

KURTZMAN
Can I forget it

SAM
Yes

Sam punches a few more buttons on the computer

KURTZMAN
What a relief
(on reflection)
I shall probably have nightmares

At this point the word Classified superimposes itself
over most of the screen and IRQ3 starts agitating at
the bottom

SAM
Damn Blast

KURTZMAN
Whats the matter

SAM
You dont happen to know how I can
get around an IRQ3 do you

KURTZMAN
All information on 3rd Level
Suspects is classified

SAM
I know that

KURTZMAN
All enquiries to Information
Retrieval Which is hopeless of
course They never tell you
anything But come the time they
want something from us

Throughout this verbal wallpaper Sam has been punching
keys cancelling the CLASSIFIED overprint He then punches
in the code for a hard-copy print-out Jills two-view
computer portrait rolls out as Sam ponders his options
SAM
(cutting off Kurtzman)
Ive go to accept that promotion
to get behind this havent I

KURTZMAN

Yes

(realising what

hes suggesting)
NO You cant Youve only just
turned it down

(thinking Sam is

joking)

SAM
I never signed the form

KURTZMAN
I did it for you

SAM
What Shit

KURTZMAN
Its what you wanted isnt it

SAM
Yes No I dont know

Kurtzman picks up Jills print-out and glances at it He
grimaces and drops it back on the desk with a shudder

KURTZMAN
Come on before they turn the lights
out

Sam nods He turns off the machine He stands up and follows
Kurtzman towards the door The door is some distance away
and before they get there all the lights go out Kurtzman
bumps into a desk and curses

INT TRANSPORT CAGE - EVENING

Packed tightly between other passengers Sam is busy drawing
long flowing hair with a pencil on the computer print-out
of Jill turning her into the Dream Girl The transport

cage rattles through its elevated tube towards a tower
block

INT SAMS CORRIDOR - EVENING

The transport cage arrives at the platform forming the end
of Sams corridor Passengers disembark and head for various
doors along the corridor Sam almost fails to get off in
time so concentrated on Jills picture is he Looking as

if hes trying to make up his mind about something he heads
for his own front door
INT SAMS FLAT - EVENING

Sam enters The place is in a state of turmoil Servicing
panels are off the walls Conduit ducting pipes unknown
mechanical horrors spew from the wall as if the place was
disemboweled Spoor stands in the middle of it all trying
to direct two other WORKMEN who are poring over wiring
plans which seem to make little sense to them Dowser is
not visible but there is a great deal of clunking and
banging going on somewhere behind the wall

SAM
What the How did you

SPOOR
Emergency procedures

DOWSER (0OS)
(muffled)
ergency procedures

SAM
(angrily)
I havent got an emergency Get
out of here

For reply Spoor whips a small tape-recorder out of his bag
and plays back Sams original phone call to Central
Services claiming an emergency Spoor shuts off his
machine puts back into his bag and comes out with what
looks like a quite thin phone hook with carbon paper between
each page Spoor indicates the bottom of page l

SPOOR
Sign here please

SAM
What is it

SPOOR
(surprised)
Its a 27B6 what did you think
it was

Sam takes out Kurtzmans old-fashioned fountain pen from
his pocket signs where indicated Spoor registers that
Sams signature has hardly penetrated through he first
carbon let alone the other 43

SPOOR
(sourly)
Havent you got a ballpoint

Sam resignedly starts signing all the other pages one by
one Spoor realises that Dowsers echo has gone missing
SPOOR
Now wheres he got to
(shouts)
Dowser

Dowser bursts through a panel in the wall This is the
panel which Tuttle had removed and replaced A few of the
flats intestines have come out with Dowser Dowser has
made a find Tuttles spare part

SPOOR
What have you got there

DOWSER
(highly excited)
Got there

Dowser points to Tuttles spare part which is hanging out

of the wall attached to rubber tube Spoor examines this
closely Sam watches alarmed The two men go into a mumbling
huddle

SPOOR

Mumble mumble mumble Tuttle
DOWSER

Mumble Tuttle
SPOOR

Tuttle mumble

(to Sam)
Youve had that scab Tuttle here

DOWSER

SAM

SPOOR

DOWSER

SAM
I fixed it myself

SPOOR
Oh yeh Whered you get this from

(he holds up Tuttles
spare part)

DOWSER
Yer nostril

SPOOR
Central Services dont take kindly
to sabotage

DOWSER
Sabotage

Spoor and Dowser and the other workmen gather up their
tools put them in the bag grab everything else that
belongs to them and are leaving Spoor grabs the form-book
out of Sams hands rips out the last page thrusts that
page at Sam shoves the book into his bag The workmen
begin leaving the flat

SAM
Hang on Wait a minute You cant
just go and leave it like this

SPOOR
(mock innocent)
Why not All youve got to do is
blow yer nose and fix it havent
you

DOWSER
vent you

SPOOR
(leaving)
Youre putting your talents to
very odd use Mr Lowry yes odd
use to pit wits against Central
Services

DOWSER
sod you stupid twit

They go slamming the door behind hem leaving Sam in the
ruins of his flat

Sam stands in the maimed sitting-room Wall panels are

off Tubes ducting wires etc spill out into the room

like greasy intestines Sam more or less collapses onto a
couch He stares at the ceiling The room is gently
hiccoughing and belching around him He stares at the print-
out of Jills face Slowly it dissolves into the Dream

Girl

EXT CONDUIT FOREST - NIGHT

Dream Girls face fills screen The camera pulls back to
reveal that she is separated from us by a tangled forest
of conduitducting-like vines Sam is struggling through
the vines which grab at him entwine and entangle him
Finally bursting free he reaches out for the Girl hovering
before him But as he embraces her she dissolves in smoke
and he plummet into a void beneath his feet

EXT CLOUDS - NIGHT

CUT TO Sam plummeting down through dense clouds his cape
twisting around him Somehow he manages to wrestle it clear
of his body Gripping the corners he whips the cape up and
over his head The wind catches it and fills it out until
it acts as a parachute slowing Sams descent Suddenly the
clouds thin out and Sam can see below him

EXT STRANGE LANDSCAPE ANTI - DAY

Sam is heading down towards a barren landscape Strange
mounds dot the barrenness they ooze smoke and the
occasional flame Near one of the mounds are two long lines
of shrouded FIGURES being forced into two giant cages
suspended beneath two great misshapen balloons The black-
robed Forces of Darkness (FOD) surround the PRISONERS
relentlessly herding them towards the cages The entire
scene is strangely coloured by unearthly light The sky is
blood red and where the sun should be is a black disc Sam
descends on his cape-parachute

CUT TO PRISONERS in their grey shrouds shuffling towards
the jaws of the brutal cages They are defeated destroyed
without hope The FOD prod and whip them forward One of
the FOD raises his spear to force a stumbling PRISONER to
his feet but stops with the spear raised above his head
He has seen something Other FODS turn to see what it is
CUT TO

Sam landing on the beach a short distance away The
prisoners stop and look up We see their faces clearly for
the first time One of them is Mrs Buttle Others are
people Sam saw in the flats and the kids Sam recognises
them He is slightly taken aback A look of determination
crosses his face He draws the sword Everyone is frozen

in place Sam starts forward But he is stopped by a violent
tremor as the earth begins to tremble and shake Everyone
looks terrified With a mighty roar a crack opens up in

the ground between Sam and the others Brilliant rays of
light shaft upwards from the opening And then with a
maniacal shriek the large black flapping thing shoots out
of the crevasse and streaks high into the sky Sam hesitates
and turns to look down into the light There under several
meters of the earths crust are fluffy white clouds darting
about in a beautiful blue sky Sam is delighted but as he
looks up he is frozen in his tracks by an enormous FIGURE
that straddles the crevasse This terrifying Creature stands
over 12 feet high He is encased in a frightening concoction
of ancient Japanese armour which seems on closer examination
to he made of computer parts His face is hidden behind a
horrific steel mask It is the Giant Samurai Warrior that
was pushing the drawer closed in the Storeroom of Knowledge
In his hand is an evil-looking spear Sam is unsure which
way to turn The grey Prisoners are being loaded into the
cages with more speed He turns to face the Giant Warrior
As Sam steps forward the Giant stands ominously still
Then very slowly he raises his spear in an almost religious
gesture POOF He vanishes As he does the light from the
day is cut off Looking down Sam sees that he crevasse
has vanished as well Maniacal laughter from the flapping
black thing makes Sam look up to see the ballooned cage
packed with grey Prisoners rise up from the ground and
begin to float away escorted by the Black flapping Thing
Sam rushes after it grabbing one of the trailing ropes
But as he is hoisted into the air it is severed by the
FODS He tumbles to the ground Looking around he sees
that for some reason the second ballooned cage is still
tethered nearby Sam rushes over to it and begins chopping
the tethers away The cage bobbles ungainlily as Sam cuts
the last restraining rope Grabbing hold he is pulled
upwards but before he can reach the cage something clutches
his leg halting his progress As he struggles his other
leg is caught He is being pulled back by two giant hands
Looking down he can see that from the top of one of the
smoking mounds a head an

d two giant arms protrude The face looks like Mr Kurtzman
Sam desperately clings on to the rope as he struggles with
the restraining hands

MR KURTZMAN OF THE MOUND
Dont go Its a trap Shes not
what she seems

Sam kicks and strains but the hands hold firm
INT SAMS FLAT - NIGHT

Sam wakes up His feet are entangled in some wiring and
ducting He is still in his devastated sitting room As he
untangles himself the door bell rings It takes a moment
for Sam to recognise it as the door bell Annoyed and still
disturbed by the dream he gets up and goes to the door He
opens it In bursts a GIRL dressed in a silly bell-boy
costume with lots of glitter net stockings and big-bowed
tap dancing shoes She launches into a terrible song and
dance routine

GIRL

(singing)
Mrs Ida Lowry requests the pleasure
of your companyyyy at her apartment
tonight from eight thirtyyyy
midnight to celebrate the completion
of her recent cosmetic surgeryyyy
The guest of honour will be Mr
Conrad Helpmann Dep Under Minister
of State for Public Information

Sam and the Girl stand looking at each other uneasily for
a moment

SAM
Er Thanks

GIRL
Its reply paid

SAM
Oh

Thank you very much mother but

GIRL
You dont have to sing it

SAM
Oh right

The Girl begins to dance again but this time in a rather
strange strangled fashion

SAM
(he looks at his
watch)
Arent you a bit late the party
started half an hour ago

GIRL
Yes I know Its the backlog
everybody complains Was it all
right otherwise

SAM
Yes it was very nice thank

GIRL
Do you mind if I use your bathroom

INT MOTHER S CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Sam rings the doorbell to his mothers flat He is wearing
an unstylish tuxedo and bow tie obviously his only dress
outfit The door is opened by a LIVERIED FLUNKY whos about
to speak when an attractive 40-year old womans face appears
over his shoulder and addresses Sam over the threshold

WOMAN
Sam Im so glad you came Do come
in

INT MOTHERS FLAT - NIGHT
Sam steps inside where the flunky proceeds to search him
The place is full of sleek people smartly but less formally
dresses than Sam It is an elegant baroque room lavishly
appointed but still violated by the ubiquitous Central
Service ducts that thrust through antique tapestries and
gilt mirrors with little regard for aesthetics or the
interior decorators feelings

SAM
(bewildered)
Mother Is that you

MOTHER

(taking his arm

looking slightly

askance at his

clothes)
Of course Isnt it wonderful The
bandages came of this afternoon
Come and join the fun Everybodys
here

SAM
Is Mr Helpmann here

MOTHER
Yes he is he wants to talk to
you

SAM

I want to talk to him

Sam pushes away the Flunky who is by now passing a metal
detector over him

MOTHER
It seems youre the first person
ever to turn down a promotion He
thinks you should see a doctor

SAM
Actually Ive decided

DR JAFFE hoves into view

MOTHER
Oh Louis You know Sam

Dr Jaffe is no longer suave He has been transformed by
drink and success Mostly by drink

DR JAFFE
(as high as a kite)
Can you believe it Just me and
my little knife Snip snip slice
slice Can you believe it
SAM
(repelled)
Congratulations

DR JAFFE
And this is just the beginning

SAM
Really

DR JAFFE
Chirst yes youve seen her with
her clothes off Faces are a doddle

MOTHER
(primly)

A handsome young piece of BEEFCAKE delivers a drink to
Mother

BEEFCAKE
Ive been looking everywhere for

The beefcake takes Mother away

DR JAFFE
Ah dear boy And what do you
think of your mother now

VOICE
(off camera)
It will never last

Sam and Dr Jaffe turn to see who is speaking It is DR
CHAPMAN a tall pipe-smoking professional-looking gent

DR JAFFE
(a trifle haughtily)
Excuse me Dr Chapman did you say
something

DR CHAPMAN
That technique Ive tried it A
nice effect But highly unstable
In six months shell look like
Grandma Moses

Sam wishing to escape from this bitchery turns away but
suddenly freezes the reflection in the large wall mirror
next to him is not that of the party guests but of the
grey Prisoners in his dream they are massed in the room
looking pleadingly towards him
DR JAFFE
(unsuave again)
Now see here Chapman At least
mine dont look like theyve been
mugged

Through the grey Prisoners pushes Mrs Terrain

MRS TERRAIN
(calls)
Sam

Sam turns around to see her pushing through the party
guests

Mrs Terrain is limping and is even more heavily swathed
in bandages than the last time

Dr Chapman hastily moves away as Mrs Terrain comes up
She claims Sam taking his arm

SAM
(looking at her
worriedly)
Whatever happened to you

MRS TERRAIN
There was a slight complication
Dr Chapman says it often happens
with a delicate skin like mine
Nothing to worry about Hes
promised me Ill have these bandages
off ina

SAM
(trying to disengage)
Actually theres someone I want
to meet

MRS TERRAIN
(roguishly)
I know I know

She drags Sam through the party and we arrive at her
daughter SHIRLEY who is of course a wallflower

MRS TERRAIN
Here we are Im going to leave
you two lovebirds in peace

SAM
I uh

But he is alone with Shirley standing at the entrance to
his Mothers embarrassingly rampant boudoir style bedroom
In amongst the diaphanous curtains enclosing the bed Mother
is playing hide and seek with a YOUNG STUD

SAM
Can I get you a drink Shirley

Shirley looks at him terrified

SAM
Look Shirley your mother
and my mother they seem to have
got the idea I mean Im terribly

flattered of course but um the
thing is I dont want you to be
under any false

SHIRLEY
(struggling into
speech shyly)
Its its all right I

This isnt what Sam expected He smiles weakly at her

VOICE

distinguished OLD MAN moving in their direction He is in
a wheelchair

HELPMANN

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Its the sort of bathroom you would expect of Mother an
adjunct to her boudoir The pink or purple lavatory is in
the process of flushing while Sam holds Mr Helpmann
vertical grasping him under the armpits while Mr Helpmann
is zipping his fly

HELPMANN
Thanks very much Sam

SAM
Thats all right Mr Helpmann
Glad to help

He is lowering Helpmann into the wheelchair

HELPMANN
If I can help you

SAM
(broaching the
subject)

In maneuvering Helpmann Sam clumsily knocks over one of
the pretty pots which fussily decorate Mothers bathroom
shelf A thin layer of powder is spread over the wash-stand

SAM

HELPMANN

Your father and I were very close
Of course Jeremiah was senior to
me but we were close friends

With his finger Helpmann is tracing letters in the powdered
surface

HELPMANN

the powder

HELPMANN

SAM

Helpmann puts out his hand Sam takes it

HELPMANN
Welcome to Information Retrieval

Helpmann blows away the spilled powder and EREIAMJH with
it

INT INFORMATION RETRIEVAL LOBBY - DAY

CUT TO WIDE SHOT of massive imposing lobby much like the
Records lobby but this one is very austere No crowds No
statues No decoration Not even the ever-present security
checks Impressive And a bit unnerving Framed in the
doorway is a lone TINY FIGURE CUT TO CLOSEUP Its Sam
He hesitates and then enters

CUT TO

VIDEO SCREEN

The video camera follows Sam across the lobby til he stops
in tight profile at Reception Desk We tilt up revealing
Sam standing facing us just beyond the monitor which is on
the desk

SAM
(diffidently to the
porter)
My name is Sam Lowry I have to
report to Mr Warren

PORTER
(looking down his
nose at Sams
unsleek clerks
suit and then
handing him an

ID badge)

Reaching into his
pocket)

SAM
(nonplussed)

PORTER
No you couldnt sir This is
Information Retrieval
(indicating to the
right)
the lifts arrived sir

INT 30TH FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY

Sam steps out of the liftThe lift doors close Sam looks
up and down the corridor hearing nothing Silence Then

he and we begin to hear a sound It is a curious whirring
murmuring tummeling sound and it seems to be growing
closer Suddenly a scrum of PEOPLE swings into view around
a corner at the far end of the rather long corridor At

the centre of the scrum is a TALL MAN with a magisterial
expression and an air of eternal bustle This is MR WARREN
He is surrounded by the EXPEDITERS who are competing for
his attention with bits of paper and bits of sentences

Mr Warren is snapping out decisions Satisfied Expediters
drop out of the scrum at intervals disappearing one at a
time through one of the many doors which line both sides

of the corridorThe scrum doesnt get any smaller because
new Expediters dart out of other doors and join the milling
MOB The whole circus is coming by Sam at the rate of knots
The sound it makes breaks down into something like this

EXPEDITER 1
(waving pager)
Mr Warren this order

EXPEDITER 2

(waving same)
Mr Warren

EXPEDITER 3

(ditto)
About this invoice Victims
list

WARREN

(dealing on all

sides)
Yes No send that back

of course not yes no maybe

CUT TO Sam watching this caravanserai with awe as it starts
pass him

EXPEDITER 4

EXPEDITER 5
Mr Warren EX27 has 15 suspects
still outstanding

EXPEDITER 6
a decision Mr Warren

WARREN
» cancel that okay put
half as terrorists the rest as
victims yes yes no

definitely no

Sam doesnt have the nerve to jump into this The scrum
sweeps by and fades away along the corridor and finally
disappearing around the corner at the other end Sam
follows Silence has descended again

INT CORRIDOR - DAY

Sam gets to the corner of the corridor and finds a similar
corridor at right angles He hesitates and continues Then
he starts to hear the sound again It is coming up from
behind Mr Warren has circumnavigated the building The
same sort of business is being enacted at the same pace
As the scrum reaches Sam he gathers his nerve and jumps
right in beside Warren and keeps going

SAM
(in a hurry)
Im Lowry Mr Warren Sam Lowry

WARREN

(putting arm around

Sam)
Ah Lowry yes

(still dealing with

Expediters)

upgraded and

Warren suddenly pivots around swinging Sam 240 degrees in
the direction they came from plus a bit

WARREN

Ah here we are
(they are standing
facing a door one
of the hundreds of
identical doors
lining these
corridors)

What do you think

The door says OFFICER DZ015

Sam has no idea what he ought to say

WARREN
(solemnly)
Your very own number on your
very own door and behind that

door

(he turns the knob

and opens the door)
your very own office
Congratulations DZ015 welcome
to the team

Warren whirls off in a flurry of paperwork and Expediters
leaving Sam standing dumfounded at the entrance to his
office
CUT TO
SAMS POV OF THE OFFICE

It is about four feet wide A small blacked-out window
high on the far wall is bisected by what looks like a
recently constructed side wall The room is bare except
for a chair and a desk which is also bisected by the new
wall Pneumatic tubes hang from the ceiling Sam slowly
enters the room

INT SAMS OFFICE - DAY

Sam looks lost disoriented He doesnt know where to
begin because theres nothing to begin with He squeezes
in behind his desk and for want of anything else to do
starts arranging his in and out baskets There in his
in basket is one of the ubiquitous executive toys gaily
wrapped with a card from Helpmann Merry Xmas and Welcome
Sam cant quite believe He returns to lining up his
pencils placing a couple of bocks (phone books) against
the wall on the left extreme of his desk Sam turns his
attention away from the books when suddenly they both fall
over with a plop Puzzled he stands the books up again
turns his eyes away and plop Same result Intrigued a
bit exasperated Sam carefully and before his very eyes
the desk begins to disappear into the wall and plop
the books topple over Puzzled Sam grabs hold of the desk
and begins to try to pull it back through the wall The
desk moves back an inch or so but then stops somehow
held stubbornly Sam grits his teeth reallllly pulls
grimacing a bit but the desk wont budge Intrigued Sam
gets up goes around his desk and heads for the door

INT CORRIDOR - DAY

CUT TO Sam coming out of his office turning right and
walking to the next door the nameplate of which reads

OFFICER DV048
As is his custom Sam opens the door without knocking
INT LIMES OFFICE - DAY

CUT TO SAMS POV Here is an office much like his Its
the other half of his room bisected by the partition wall
The other half of his desk is occupied by a slimy looking
round-headed little JUNIOR EXECUTIVE wholly occupied with
trying to drag a bit more of the desk into his office He
is unaware of Sam

SAM
Hello
Lime startled lets go of his desk and vents his irritation
on Sam whom he mistakes for someone else

LIME
No you cant have any more chairs
Theres only one left in here now
and I need that to sit on
(realizing his
mistake)
Oh er sorry Who are you

SAM
Sam Lowry

LIME

(becoming unctuous)
Ah yes youre the new boy from
next door ha ha

(he advances toward

Sam with hand out

to shake shaking

hands)
My names Lime Harvey Lime Welcome

SAM
Ah

around)
Would you mind if I borrowed your
computer console

LIME

SAM
Yes
LIME
(after a moments
consideration)

(indicates computer

console)
Sam hesitates but sees that theres
no other way

SAM
(taking print-out

on Jill from his

pocket)
Alright Theres someone I want to
check out A woman called Gillian
Layton

LIME
(leering)
A woman eh I see

SAM
(trying to ignore
this)
I know her age and distinguishing
marks But I need an address or a
place of work or something

LIME
(continuing to leer)
This is your dream girl is it

SAM
(taken aback)
What
(recovering)
Look let me use the console for a
few minutes

LIME

(trying to be jocular)
You must be joking

(entirely

unconvincing)
When theres a woman involved
theres no stopping me Now let
me have that sheet

He takes Jills print-out sheet from Sam and begins to
punch the keys laboriously with one finger Nothing happens

LIME
Sod it its broken

SAM
You havent switched it on

LIME
Oh yes Look youre putting me
off standing there Go back to
your office and Ill give you a
knock when Ive finished

Sam hesitates but goes

LIME

her
Sam exits
INT SAMS OFFICE - DAY

Sam is sitting in his office listening to the protracted
one finger exercise which is going on next door He stares
dumbly at the shining absolutely useless executive toy

EXT ICY SEA ANTI - DAY

The CAMERA skims along over an icy sea This is SAMS POV
as he wings his way over the water with his new gleaming
wings In the distance rises a strange massive ship

As he gets closer we can see that the snip is listing
heavily to one side In fact it is barely afloat Closer
still it becomes apparent that the ship is made of stone
Dark evil grey blocks of granite form not only the hull
but the super-structures and smokestacks It looks like a
massive medieval fortress gone to sea The screen is
engulfed in stone The CAMERA heads up the side of the
ship Higher and higher we climb past course after course
of mammoth stones Reaching the first deck we continue
upwards There appears to be no entrance Sam is looking
frustrated and angry But then he spots an opening A few
stones have come loose one of them juts out forming a
ledge As the cage passes Sam jumps and managed to gain a
foothold on the outcropping Squeezing thru the gap in the
rocks he makes his way thru a dark passage Emerging from
the opening he finds himself teetering over an enormous
abyss formed by the outer hull and the inner stone core of
the ship Great stone ribs curve downwards thru the darkness
broken only by narrow shafts of brilliant light streaming
from occasional cracks and fissures in the stone core For
a brief moment Sam gets a glimpse of blue sky thru one of
the openings but his attention is distracted by a distant
moan Huddled far below him at the bottom of the dark abyss
are hundreds of grey shrouded Prisoners Their moan blends
with the creaks and groans of the stones as the ship slowly
wallows back and forth Suddenly a great boom resounds
throughout the ship Sam is unsure where it comes from

And then another boom reverberates about him He has to
steady himself as the ship quivers from the noise Another
book He clutches at the wall

INT SAMS OFFICE - DAY

Sams head is leaning against the wall of his office The
boom repeats LIME is knocking on the other side Sam leaps
up As he leaves his office he looks back to see the desk
creep through to Limes office a little bit more

INT LIMES OFFICE - DAY

Sam enters Lime is standing proudly holding out a sheet
of paper

LIME
Computers are my forte

SAM

(reading)
Gillian Layton age twenty three
eyes blue hair black weight
one hundred and twenty-one pounds
distinguishing marks blemish on
right shoulder scar on left elbow
He stops having come to the end
He looks at the other side of the
paper but theres nothing there
Is this all you got

LIME
Its a start isnt it

SAM
(disbelieving)
But I already knew this

LIME
Best to take it slowly where some
women are concerned

Sam sits on Limes chair and deftly punches the computer
keys

LIME
Hey thats my desk

SAM

(working quickly)
Gillian Layton Suspect S5173

with Sam)

you want the lift

The cavalcade is passing the lifts Sam backs away into

the open lift The cavalcade passes on out of sight The
lift contains a CHARLADY with a bucket and mop She remains
in the lift as Sam joins her

INT THE LIFT - DAY

Sam presses the button for the 50th floor The lift doors
close on him and the Charlady From somewhere far away
there is the groaning shriek of a man in pain Sam glances
around the lift There appears to be an air conditioning
vent in the ceiling

Sam glances enquiringly at the Charlady who merely smiles
at him Another scream is heard

SAM
Whats that

The Charlady smiles again

SAM
Doesnt that disturb you

The Charlady fiddles with something in her ears and pulls
out a pair of wax earplugs

CHARLADY
Beg your pardon

The lift arrives
INT 50TH FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY

The lift arrives Sam steps out The Charlady remains in
the lift The doors close Sam heads down surgically clean
white-tiled corridor

Passing a white-coated TECHNICIAN monitoring what appears
to be electric meters Sam comes to a door with 5001 Above
the door a red light is glowing Sam knocks The red light
goes out and a green light comes on Sam enters

INT ROOM 500L - DAY

Inside there is a connecting door to he next door room but
the only person in the immediate room is a pleasant-looking
FEMALE TYPIST wearing headphones chewing gum and typing
with great facility Sam approaches the Typist who busily
typing twinkles a greeting (mimed) and silently mouths

the words

TYPIST

It wont be long now

(she carries on

typing)
Sam nods and stands quietly by
her He can hear tiny sounds coming
through her headphones He looks
down at the piece of paper in the
typewriter He reacts a bit
strangely perhaps even winces We
see he close up of the words being
struck crisply on paper

ON TYPEWRITER

AHHHH Oh God No dont UHH
please I STOP I cant
stand AIIEEEE
TYPIST
(quietly still
typing)

Can I help you

She is looking at Sam helpfully holding one of the
earphones away from her ear From this earphone we can
just hear quietly

EARPHONE
Oooooooh aaaaaahhh please
arrrrrghhhh no please Oh
God No No stop I dont know
SAM

Im looking for Officer 412L

The Typist nods smiling She puts back the earphone and
carries on typing

TYPIST
Im sure he wont be long now

She types a little more but suddenly stops

TYPIST
I thought so

She takes off the earphones and takes the paper and
carbonums out of her typewriter and starts collating all
the different copies

Through the frosted glass door leading into the next area
Sam can see a FIGURE come through a double door and turn
left making a silly hi sign to the Typist as he exits
from sight She is charmed Almost immediately after them
a white-coated TECHNICIAN exits but to the left

TYPIST
You can go in now

INT JACKS OFFICE - DAY

Sam goes through the glass door and is about to push open
the double doors in front of him He is halted by a noise
from the Typist she indicates that he is to go to the
left He does so and enters an office An antique desk
with a large collection of executive toys and other
tastefully reassuring furniture fill the room which is a
rather oddly shaped distorted as it by the curved wall
of the much larger room that Sam was stopped from entering
Nevertheless the feel of the room is confidently successful
A buzzing noise draws Sams attention to the wash basin in
the far corner The Information Retrieval Technician is
standing by a sink massing his temples with old-fashioned
scalp vibrators His back to us

SAM
Excuse me Are you office 412L

The Technician makes no sign of having heard this He
continues vibrating his temples

SAM
(a bit louder)
Er excuse me

Getting no response Sam walks over to the Technician As

he passes the desk he notices a strange mask lying face
down on the desk top It seems strangely familiar but as
it is a negative concave image Sam isnt sure He continues
over to the Technician

SAM
(louder)
Excuse me

He touches the Technician on the shoulder who jumps with
a start He spins around and turns out to be none other
than Jack Lint He is amazed to see Sam

SAM
(surprised)
Jack

JACK
(recovering slightly)
SAM What a surprise

SAM
(even more surprised)

Are you officer 412L

Jack looks confused He pauses and then removes ear plugs

JACK
(shaking Sams hand)
Sorry about that Mr Helpmann
told me you were coming aboard
congratulations
SAM

Thanks Are you officer 412L

JACK
For my sins Are you settling in
alright

SAM
Yes thanks

JACK
Terrific Im really glad you

have any time right now Ive got a
queue of customers to deal with
er why dont we have a drink

tonight
SAM
(diffidently)
Ah
JACK
What
SAM

I dont want to take up your time
now but I was hoping you could
give me some information on
somebody Its a security level
three matter and Information
Retrieval records says to refer to
you

JACK

OK Come back this afternoon about
four oclock If you give me the
number of the case Ill have the
dossier here waiting

(he pulls card from

his pocket pushes

it towards Sam)
My tailor well worth the
investment

SAM
(taking print-out
sheets from his
pocket)
Ive got numbers all over these
Im not sure which is the one you
want

JACK
(looking at the
print-out picture
of Jill over Sams
shoulder)
Layton Oh shit

SAM
What is it

JACK
You clever bastard I might have
guessed You only moved in today
and youre already hot on the bloody
trail

SAM
Am I

JACK
Please Sam were going to have
to be open to each other on this
one If you make a reputation with
this case itll be at my expense

SAM
How do you mean

JACK
How much do you know

SAM
Not much

JACK
Enough though eh

SAM
(getting sucked
into this exchange)
Not really no

Jack goes over to the sink and turns on the taps full blast
splashing the water noisily into the basin

JACK
OK OK Lets not fence around
This is the situation Some idiot
somewhere in the building some
insect confused two of our clients
B58732 and T47215

SAM
B58732 thats A Buttle isnt
it

JACK
Christ You do know it all

SAM
No no I dont Im just beginning
Honestly Sorry carry on

JACK
Well your A Buttle has been
confused with T47215 an A Tuttle
I mean its a joke Somebody should
be shot for that So B58732 was
pulled in by mistake

SAM
You got the wrong man

JACK
(a little heated)

I did not get the wrong man I got
the right man The wrong man was
delivered to me as the right man
I accepted him on trust as the
right man Was I wrong Anyway to
add to the confusion he died on
us Which had he been the right
man he wouldnt have done

SAM
You killed him

JACK

(annoyed)
Sam there are very rigid parameters
laid down to avoid that event but
Buttles heart condition did not
appear on Tuttles file Dont
think Im dismissing this business
Sam Ive lost a weeks sleep over
it already

SAM
Im sure you have

JACK
There are some real bastards in
this department who dont mind
breaking a few eggs to make an
omelette but thank God there are
the new boys like me who want to
maintain decent civilized standards
of terrorist eradication Weve

got the upper hand for the moment
but theyre waiting for us to slip
up and a little slip- up like

this is just the chance theyre
looking for

SAM
So how

JACK
What Ive got to do now is pick up
Tuttle interrogate him at the
same voltage as Buttle to the
same meter reading to the last
penny and juggle the books in
electrical banking

SAM
What has Tuttle done

JACK
We suspect him of freelance
subversion

SAM
(dumbly)
Hes a freelance subversive

JACK
Hes a compulsive heating engineer
A maverick ex-Central Service repair
man with a grudge against society
Now fortunately were nearly out
of the wood I think At least we
will be when I get this Layton
woman under arrest

Jack turns off taps and goes behind screen
SAM
(agitated)
Whats she done
JACK
You didnt know as much about this
business as you pretended to did

you

SAM

JACK
Very smart

SAM
Er but I wouldve found out
anyway

JACK

Yes Im impressed

SAM
(playing the game)
Tell me about Layton

JACK
She witnessed the Tuttle arrest
the Buttle arrest and since then
shes been making wild allegations
obviously trying to exploit the
situation shes working for
somebody and shes not working
for us

SAM
A terrorist

Jack comes from behind the screen with a look confirming
just what Sam fears and hands him a suit

SAM
Ah thanks

Sam begins to put the suit on

SAM
(hesitantly)
But surely I mean perhaps she
just happened to live above the
Buttles and

JACK
(picking up
photograph of wife
and kids from his
desk)
Look after that suit eh Barbara
chose it for me

SAM
Right Er youre not going to
keep calling her Barbara are you

JACK
Barbaras a perfectly good name
isnt it

SAM
(preferring to let
his drop)
Look about the Layton woman maybe
shes just trying to help the Buttle
family

JACK
Why

SAM
Why Hell not for any reason

JACK
(baffled)
I dont follow you

SAM
Out of kindness

JACK
(utterly baffled)
Kindness Whats the purpose behind
this line of enquiry

SAM
(deciding to abandon
this line of country)
So what are you going to do about
her

JACK
Get her out of circulation Ive
put her on the detention list

SAM
(thinking fast)
You mean youre going to invite
her in so that she can spill the
beans inside the department

JACK
(taken aback)
Well I Good point What do you
suggest
SAM

Let me try to get to her Ill
deactivate her

JACK
What does that mean I dont want
to be involved in anything
unsavoury

SAM
Trust me You do trust me dont
you
JACK
Of course We went to school
together Youre my oldest friend

SAM
And youre mine

JACK
Youre the only person I can trust

SAM
Then wed better keep this business
just between the two of us

JACK
Right Just between as and the
Security Forces

SAM
They werent at school with us

JACK
But Ive already put her on the
search and detain list

SAM
Take her off the list

JACK
Theres no procedure for that until
shes been arrested

SAM
Say it was a mistake

JACK
We dont make mistakes

SAM
Well Id better get out there and
try to get to her before security
does Let me borrow her dossier
for a while

JACK
Er alright For Christs sake
dont lose it Here youd better
sign for it

Jack presents Sam with something to sign He then gives
him the dossier

SAM
Thanks Jack Ill be in touch

JACK
Do you know what youre doing
SAM
(about to say no
then pauses)

Trust me
JACK
(admiring Sams new
look)
Sam were proud to have you at

executive package)

INT CORRIDOR - DAY

Sam steps out of Room 5001 newly suited with old suit

over arm TWO GUARDS are guiding a BAGGEE down the corridor
ahead of him Suddenly the Baggee breaks away from his
Guards and begins to cannonball down the corridor directly
at Sam Sam is flattened against the wall as the Baggee
rockets by

CUT TO GUARDS strolling past Sam

CUT TO BAGGEE running full tilt to the end of the corridor
smashing into the wall bouncing back getting up (now
cross-ways in the corridor) bouncing off that wall then
the wall behind him then

INT LIFT - DAY

Slightly unnerved Sam gets in the lift pushes the button
for his floor the 30th and immediately begins perusing
Jills dossier The lift descends But unnoticed by Sam
continued past his floor without stopping It stops at the
Lobby Mezzanine Sam looks up and realizes he is on the
wrong floor Angrily he pushes the correct floor number

but before the doors close he hears an angry womans voice
echoing through the massive lobby He looks in the direction
of the porters desk There stands Jill arguing with the
PORTER

JILL
But youve stamped this form before
Why wont you stamp it now

PORTER
Youve just said yourself Miss
weve already stamped it Why should
we stamp it twice

Sam is frozen He cant believe what he sees The lift

doors close Sam is too slow to stop them Madly he pushes
the buttons to no effect The lift descends (At this

point we had better describe the lift It is a cross between
the old metal grille lifts with accordion grille doors and
the super-sleek modern lifts that rise and fall in glass
tubes so that one can have panoramic views of dramatic
architectural spaces such as the lobbies of the Ministry)

Sam can see Jill and if Jill were to look up she could see
Sam descending He is shouting and rattling the bars of
the lift cage but no sound escapes to catch her attention
Sam sinks below the floor of the lobby desperately trying
to stop the demon lift From his POV we see Jill
disappearing from view still arguing with the Porter

INT BASEMENT - DAY

The lift comes to rest Sam is still trying to get it to
respond and return him to the lobby TWO TECHNICIANS are
waiting as the doors open From Sams POV he sees them

hang a sign on the door and walk away He bangs the buttons
for another moment with no result He looks out of the

lift and is able to read the sign LIFT OUT OF ORDER
Frantically he looks around for another lift All the others
are on distant floors then he spots one off to one side
its doors standing open Rushing over to it he leaps inside
and reaches to push the floor number but there are no
numbers on the buttons only letters Before he can sort
this out a voice shouts at him

VOICE
Hey you get out of there

A GUARD approaches looking tough and mean

GUARD
What do you think youre doing
thats the Deputy Ministers lift

SAM
Sorry Im in a hurry

GUARD
Hold on sonny lets see your
ID

Sam fumbles through his pockets desperate to get back to

the lobby before Jill leaves He has forgotten he is wearing
his new ID badge The Guard cant see it because Jills
dossier is covering it

SAM
Shit its here somewhere My
names Lowry Sam Lowry
Expediting cant this wait

GUARD
No sir
(getting out book
of forms)
Im going to have to file a report
Sam

on this Now what date is it

gives up trying to find his ID card

(frantic)

He runs off dropping suit towards some stairs he has
spotted

GUARD

He starts to run after Sam TWO OTHER GUARDS also give

chase

pounds of high explosive And if

Jill thumps the desk with her fist
INT BASEMENT - DAY

The Guard throws the alarm switch
INT LOBBY - DAY

Alarm bells start ringing and from secret doors heavily
armed GUARDS leap out their guns trained on Jill as she
appears to be the only person around

GUARD
(shouting)
DROP IT

Jill has only the form in her hand which she dutifully
drops She is terrified by the suddenness and size of the
response to her hitting the desk The Guards close in

Sam rushes out of the door leading to the stairs He cant
believe the sight that greets him He responds
instinctively

SAM
STOP Let her go

He rushes over to the Porters desk just as the Guards
behind him come through the door He doesnt have a clue
what he is going to do but as he reaches the group of
Guards they snap attention Confused he looks around and
then realizes his ID badge is on his lapel and the Guards
are responding as trained The Guards chasing him screech

to a halt when they see the others snapping to attention
Everyone looks confused embarrassed hesitant to make the
next move Sam breaks the silence

SAM
Well done uh excellent work
quick thinking Ill take charge
of her now

Realising he has Jills dossier he shows it to everyone
her print-out pictures are on the front page Its a
classified matter Ill include your fine handling of
the situation in my report

Sam is suddenly aware he is still holding the executive
toy present he hands it to the Porter

SAM
(grabbing Jill)
Come with me please

He hustles her towards the door
EXT INFORMATION RETRIEVAL BUILDING - DAY

Sam marches Jill out of the main door and down the front
steps of the Information Retrieval building As he struggles
with her some of the papers in the dossier slip out
unbeknownst to Sam and leave a trail of litter behind them

JILL
Who are you Let go

SAM
Dont look back Act naturally

JILL
How can I act naturally when youve
trying to break my arm

CUT TO THE POV of the Ministry of Information front door
Guards They are looking down the steps at the retreating
backs of Sam and Jill who are jostling each other The
Guards see Jill elbow Sam in the ribs

SAM
(wincing)
Ow That hurt

JILL
Good

VOICE FROM BEHIND
STOP Come back here

SAM
Oh God no

He turns around knowing that the game is up But instead
of one of the Guards shouting its an OLD LADY angrily
glaring at him and pointing to a Keep your city tidy
sign above a litter bin

OLD LADY
(screaming)

Cant you read english You
illiterate foreign pig You come
here from your own filthy country
and think you can mess our streets
up You should be fried alive you
dirty verminous etc etc

Sam sees the trail of dossier litter blowing about the
pavement He lets go of Jill for a moment to grab at the
papers The Lady continues screaming at him her little
Pekinese dog (who incidentally wears a plaster over his
bum hole) yaps at his ankles ripping Sams new trousers
Sam is torn between trying to regain the pages of the
dossier and following Jill who has disappeared round the
corner He gives up retrieving the paper and rushes after
Jill

CUTTING BACK to the two Guards who have been observing
all this bizarre activity we see one of them reading one
of the pieces of paper

OTHER GUARD
Hey you shouldnt be reading that
its classified

EXT JUST AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

Jill is behind the steering wheel of her lorry which is
just starting to move off Sam frantically runs towards
the lorry leaps on the running board and pulls himself up

into the cab

INT LORRY CAB - DAY

SAM
(climbing in)
Well done thats it Lets go

Vrmmm Vrmmm

Sam looks up and down his side of the street anxiously
before realizing that Jill has switched off the engine and
is sitting glaring at him They are stopped right in front
of the Ministry building

SAM
(frantic)
What are you doing For Christs
sake Get moving

JILL
Who are you

Desperately Sam pulls roller blind down over window

SAM
(hurriedly)
Sam Lowry Hello This sounds
insane I know but Ive been
dreaming about you Even before I
Saw you you were in my dreams

Weird isnt it I mean I dont

Still Jill does nothing Sam pulls down roller blind over
window

SAM
(desperate)
Bloody hell Do as I say

JILL
(hard icy cool)
No
SAM
(beginning to lose
his bottle)

Jill continues to sit glaring

Sam delves into his pockets and drags out a handful of

ID cards and papers most of which fall onto the floor
He then remembers that the badge hes looking for is pinned
to his jacket He thrusts it forward at Jill

SAM

(beside himself

with panic)
Alright Alright Alright Im

Where are you taking me

EXT TRAVELLING LORRY - DAY

WE PULL BACK and lift off to see that the beautiful
countryside through which weve been travelling is in fact
a solid wall of giant bill-boards advertising all sorts
of wonders like pine scented lavatory paper sea spray
flavored cigarettes you name it These advertisements
form an unbroken corridor down which the road travels
From a birds eye POV we see that the land behind the
hoardings is blasted and blighted with garbage etc

EXT POWER PLANT - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)

The power plant is an extensive brutal Dantes Inferno
of a landscape made mainly of steel towers chimneys
huge pipes buildings which look like bomb shelters It
is still daylight but the whole scene is murky and
forbidding because of the swirling steam and smoke In the
murk can be seen sinister-looking FIGURES in protective
clothing and hard hats
This is the world which is now entered by Jills lorry
The lorry halts at a despatching hut near the crane and
Jill jumps down from the cab Sam stays inside looking
around Something catches his eye

CUT TO
FACADE OF HOUSE

Window boxes with flowers and shrubbery surrounded by a
white picket fence provide domestic charm however in the
doorway stands a MAN with protective clothing and something
like a gas-mask over his face He is waving to someone
Slowly the house rises out of frame

In a WIDER SHOT we can see the house is suspended from and
a giant crane that swings it through the air air filled
with stead smoke evil-smelling fumes It is lowered onto
the back of a lorry and we can see that the house is one
of many prefabricated houses used in the construction of
the power plant

INT LORRY CAB - DAY

Sam watches Jill walk away from the lorry and enter the
despatchers hut He looks around uneasily and then he
start examining the inside of the lorry and opens a
compartment which seems to be full of maps rags etc He
gets grease on sleeve of his suit In the space behind the
seats he finds the pieces of luggage which Jill had carried
away from the flat He starts to examine this cautiously
and is startled by the sudden opening of the cab door

JILL
Dont act guilty Act like me Im
just getting on with my job Or
are you just getting on with yours

Jill gets into the cab and closes the door and drives to a
forward looking position

SAM
Whats going on here

JILL
What does it look like Im
collecting empties

The lorry stops and Jill gets out From Sams POV the
house suspended from the crane starts moving through the
sky towards the lorry He glances back to see Jill slip a
package out from behind the seat She glances
surreptitiously over her shoulder and slipping the parcel
inside her jacket she walks away

EXT LORRY - LATE AFTERNOON
Sam climbs down from the cab trying to keep an eye on Jill
He ends up standing next to a rusty Kodak Photospot
standard The picture on it though faded by pollution is
of the beautiful valley that has now been replaced by the
murk and mess of the power plant Jill has made her way
over to a rather SHADOWY FIGURE lurking around the corner
of one of the metal structures They appear to be exchanging
parcels Sam is worried by this suspicious behaviour
reinforced as it is by a Ministry poster on the side of
the building that illustrates almost identically the
action we have just seen along with the warning MIND
THAT PARCEL EAGLE EYES CAN SAVE A LIFE

CUT TO the house being lowered and secured onto the lorry
INT LORRY CAB - LATE AFTERNOON

Jill is starting up the lorry Sam is glancing over her
shoulder at the suspicious parcel which is tucked behind
her They move off The last view of the power plant is of
a group of MEN all in protective clothing and masks happily
playing a game of volleyball

INT TRAVELLING LORRY - LATER AFTERNOON

SAM
OK Whats in the parcel

JILL
What parcel

Sam nods knowingly in the direction of the parcel

JILL
I dont know Christmas present

Sam picks it up

SAM
Its heavy

JILL
A heavy Christmas present

He glances at her suspiciously

JILL
Open it if you dont trust me

Sam hesitates and puts the parcel down

SAM
Id rather trust you

Jill gives him a quizzical look and smiles slightly in
spite of herself She turns away so that he wont notice
INT TRAVELLING LORRY IN CITY TRAFFIC - DUSK

Sam is at

JILL
What are you doing in Information
Retrieval

SAM
Looking for you

JILL
No really

SAM
Really

JILL

I mean it doesnt suit you

(looking at his
jacket)

JILL
Who is this war against Sam

SAM
Well terrorists of course

JILL
How many terrorists have you met
Actual terrorists

SAM
Actual terrorists Well its
only my first day

Jill bursts out laughing Sam joins in They are both
laughing hysterically as they approach the Central Supplies
depot

EXT CENTRAL SUPPLIES - DUSK

The impression is that the place could be an abandoned
airfield out to the use of a vast open air warehouse whose
contents is arranged in a grid pattern of streets all
the streets being lined by stacks piles ranks jumbles
of goods and objects which seem at first to be arbitrarily
grouped some of them (like the stacks of prefabricated
houses) standing in the open others protected under simple
areas of roofing Each group of Assorted Supplies lies
inside the squares of the grid of streets The streets are
eerily lit by lights just being switched on and each square
is also lit by harsh localized lighting The effect is a
nightmarish gigantic Aladdins cave of black shadows and
garishly lit mountains of stuff

INT LORRY - DUSK
Jills lorry starts down one of the streets

JILL
(as they pass a
clock in Cs)
Look at that right on time

SAM
What I thought you were free to
come and go as you please

JILL
Well almost unfortunately I do
have to punch in by 500 every
day

SAM

(slightly surprised)
Every day Turn around

JILL
What

SAM
Theyll be there waiting

JILL
Who will

SAM
Security

JILL

Youre joking

SAM
No Please Theyre going to arrest
you

JILL

I thought you arrested me

SAM
Yes but this is real Now
stop
(he grabs for the
emergency brake)

JILL
(pushing his hand
away)
Cut it out Sam

SAM
(grabbing at the
steering wheel)
Will you please turn back

JILL
(shoving him back)
Get away
SAM

(lunging for the
steering wheel)

Turn
JILL
(unable to control
him)
Stop it damn you

Sam throws the lorry into a gut-sucking skid
EXT CENTRAL SUPPLIES - DUSK

The lorry skids around a corner and roars down a side
of containers

street
INT LORRY - DUSK
Sam and Jill are fighting for control of the lorry

JILL
Youre mad Youre out of your
mind

At that moment the air is split apart by the wail of sirens
Sam and Jill look back

EXT CENTRAL SUPPLIES - DUSK

From inside two strategically placed wooden containers
stacked amongst the piles of containers marked AUTOMOBILES
burst forth two Security vehicles Wood flying lights
flashing wheels smoking they squeal away in pursuit

INT LORRY - DUSK

SAM
I was right Step on it

JILL
Let go Weve got to stop

SAM
Now youre the one thats out of
your mind

JILL
Sam we cant outrace them Youll
kill us

They struggle for control of the lorry
EXT CENTRAL SUPPLIES - DUSK

The lorry rumbles down the street of containers lurching
from side to side as the battle in the cab wages back and
forth Containers are smashed open and their contents spill
out only to be further damaged as the pursuing Security
vehicles crash through them The lorry escapes from the
streets of containers and cannons through the main gate

and out on to the streets of the city

INT LORRY CAB - DUSK

Sam and Jill are still struggling violently for control of
the lorry Sam is terribly inexpert as a driver but he
behaves like someone possessed Through the rear view
mirrors he can see the Security vehicles catching up with
them He starts fumbling with he multiple gear levers

JILL
Dont touch those
EXT DOMESTIC STREETS - DUSK

The lorry roars down a street of terraced houses and then
screeches around a corner

INT LORRY - DUSK

Sam pushes Jills hand back and grabs for the lever that

he thinks is overdrive But rather than gaining speed there
is a terrible lurch as the house and trailer disconnect
from the cab

EXT DOMESTIC STREET - DUSK

The house slides off the trailer which is skidding sideways
and crunches to the ground just as the Security vehicles
round the corner

INT SECURITY VEHICLE - DUSK

From behind the DRIVER we can see that the house has settled
across the roadway at right-angle to the other houses
making it appear to be a normal dead end street So shocked
is the Driver that he fails to stop in time and KABLOW

the car smashes into the house

EXT DOMESTIC STREET - DUSK
Hot on the heels of the lst car the 2nd vehicle skids and
then smashes into the house which collapses and then

explodes in flames

INT JILLS LORRY - DUSK

Sam sits paralysed with shock The lorry has come to a
halt Jill is desperately trying to get him to move

JILL
Come on lets go Lets get out
of here

SAM

Oh God What have we done

JILL
We Dont blame me

SAM
It wasnt supposed to happen like
this

JILL

(looking behind)
Shit The house is on fire

SAM
And your children all gone

JILL
What

SAM
Lady bird lady bird fly away
home your house is on fire and
your children all gone Do you
think anyones hurt

JILL
Yes
(tapping him on the
forehead)
Come out I know youre in there

EXT DOMESTIC STREET - DUSK

A Security vehicle in full banshee howl roars through the
streets We roar along with it as it rounds a corner and
skids to a halt at a safe but striking distance from Jills
lorry Heavily armed SECURITY POLICE pour out and take up
firing positions behind parked cars or whatever other cover
is available Searchlights are played on the lorry The
OFFICER IN CHARGE appears with a loud-hailer

OFFICER IN CHARGE
Come out we know youre in there
You cannot possibly escape Throw
your weapons from your vehicle and
come out slowly with your hands on
your heads Obey my instructions
and no harm will come to you But
if you force us to shoot well
shoot to kill

During the above speech a SMALL BOY on a tricycle roars
around a corner behind the Security Police He rides into

a gap between them rolls his tricycle over and takes
cover behind it He points his toy rifle at Jills lorry
and takes shot In reaction to the noise made by the kids
rifle the Officer In Charge dives for cover and the Security
Troops open fire and pepper Jills lorry cab with holes A
few of the Security Troops then rush forward and fling

open the cab door The cab is empty The Officer In Charge
gets to his feet and looks about His uniform is covered
with dust oil and shit from the street He just misses
seeing the back of the Boy as he disappears round the corner
on his tricycle

INT LINGERIE DEPARTMENT SHOPPING CENTER - DAY

To the lush sound of musak we glide through the glittering
sensuous supportive world of ladies undergarments As we
slip past girdles bras panti-hose for a variety of exotic
occasions we come upon Sam and Jill pushing a shopping
trolley In the trolley is the suspicious parcel which
Jill was given at the power plant

SAM
This is a hell of a time to buy a
nightie

JILL

Are you still following me

SAM

Please Jill I love you
JILL

Go away
SAM

There are plenty of other safe
places Why dont we go back to my
flat

JILL
Leave me alone

SAM
Youve got to trust me It sounds
silly but I know we were meant to
meet

JILL
You mean you were meant to hijack
my truck make me crash it and
have every security man in town
looking for me

SAM
I was just trying to help I decided
to trust you Maybe I was wrong
Whose side are you on really Who
are your friends Who was the man
who gave you the parcel Whats
in it Its the only thing you
saved from the lorry It must he
something very special

JILL
I saved you from the lorry and
youre not very special

SAM
Its a bomb isnt it

JILL
(exasperated)

Oh Jesus

Sam grabs the parcel from the trolley and tries to start
tearing it open

SAM
Im going to open it

JILL
(grabbing parcel
and trying to take
it from him)
No youre not

They start an ugly little struggle for the parcel Sams
suit gets slightly ripped Their tug-of-war is interrupted
by a voice off camera

VOICE
SAM

Sam turns to see Mrs Terrain and Shirley a short distance
away Mrs Terrain is heavily bandaged and sitting ina
wheelchair which Shirley is pushing

MRS TERRAIN
Its me and Shirley

From the Terrains POV Sam looks as if he is wrestling

with a dummy or with himself if he is beside a full length
mirror The mirror or something obscures Jill Mrs Terrain
and Shirley exchange puzzled looks and proceed toward Sam

SAM

Ah hello Mrs Terrain Sam
lets go of the parcel and pushes
Jill away She moves off

(after Jill for

Mrs Terrains

benefit)
I think thatll hold it

(to Shirley)
Hello Shirley Just helping someone
tie up a Christmas present How
are you

MRS TERRAIN
My complication had a complication
but Dr Chapman says Ill soon be
up and bouncing about like a young
gazelle Are you buying a Christmas
present for your mother

SAM
(trying to keep an
eye on Jill who is
disappearing from
sight)
Er yes
MRS TERRAIN
Shirley and I come here regularly
I love romantic lingerie

She unwraps a set of red and black fur trimmed things
with strategic holes in them

MRS TERRAIN
(coyly)
Picture me in these

At this moment there is an almighty explosion from the far
corner of the store It is the corner that we last saw
Jill moving towards Sam races towards the smoke dust
covering his suit He finds bras knickers broken shop
dummies bleeding CUSTOMERS and SHOP ASSISTANTS all over
the place On the edge of this devastated area he sees
Jill struggling out from under a pile of negligees and
plaster dust He rushes over to her

SAM
(frantic)
Are you alright

JILL
Yes

SAM

(anxiety giving way

to anger)
You dont deserve to be You should
be dead or maimed like them
How could you

(indicating the

wounded)
What a bloody stupid thing I
should have made you open it in
the lorry

She has dug the parcel out of the debris and has ripped it
open Under the brown paper are a dozen brightly coloured
Christmas packages yes you guessed it executive toys
She throws the parcel and its contents hard into Sams
chest He topples back-wards tangling himself up with the
severed limbs of a shop dummy

JILL
Theres your bomb Our annual bribes
for official ass-holes like you

Sam sits in the debris ashamed and relieved Liquor oozes
from the broken bottle all over Sams suit He is ata
loss for words

Jills attention is attracted by moans coming from the
badly hurt BOMB VICTIMS She goes to help them
JILL
(to Sam)
Come on make yourself useful
there are people hurt

Jill goes around trying to make the injured comfortable
Sam follows her He takes off his jacket with his
Information Retrieval badge on the lapel and uses it to
make a pillow for one of these victims By now sirens are
wailing water sprinklers are functioning and there is
general pandemonium SECURITY GUARDS run into the area and
begin arresting everyone including the dead and injured
ONE OF THE GUARDS tries to drag off the WOMAN whom Jill is
attending

JILL
Hey stop shes hurt

The Guard gives Jill a thump in the side of the face with
his gloved hand Sam sees red

SAM
DONT TOUCH HER

The Guard looks up and as he does so he is transformed
into the Giant Warrior from Sams dream He towers over
the wounded the dying and the debris of the blasted
lingerie department Sam grabs for a weapon and comes up
with one of the arms (now detached) of the shop dummy It
makes a passable club

JILL
SAM dont

The two combatants square off looking for an opening
a chink in the others defences at which point Sam is
flattened from behind by a TROOPERS gun butt

INT STONE SHIPANTI - DAY

Sam is falling down the inner wall of the stone ship He
tumbles end over end unable to stop his crashing descent
With a thud he hits the bottom Stunned bruised and
battered he tries to get up Standing over him are the
grey Prisoners They press forward

SAM
(feebly)

Where is she Is she here

The grey Prisoners dissolve into what looks like several
BAGGEES

INT BLACK MARIA - EVENING

The Baggees hang from a track on the ceiling of the Black
Maria Sam is lying on the floor covered by his jacket
with his badge prominently displayed He is dazed and
mumbling the only Baggee in the wagon apart from TWO
GUARDS who have removed their helmets and are relaxing
while travelling back to base

GUARD A
(scratching his
head)
These helmets dont half make your
scalp itch

GUARD B

Ooh dont mention it

(beginning to scratch

his head)
And they make you sweat Half the
time I cant see where Im going
theres a great Niagara of
perspiration coming down

GUARD A
Im lucky Ive got thick eyebrows
That keeps it up and channels it
out to my ears

SAM STIRS AND GROANS

GUARD B
Whos he

GUARD A
Someone from Information Retrieval
theyre always hanging about in
lingerie

Sam is coming to his senses He takes in the situation
sees all the BAGGEES and staggers to his knees

SAM
Jill Jill Are you there

He begins rummaging through the Baggees One of which is
dressed as FATHER CHRISTMAS Sam opens the face vent of
the Baggees hoods A pair of strange eyes look out

GUARD A
Excuse me sir thats government
property

SAM

Is here a girl here Tall fair
hair blue eyes

GUARD A
Dunno sir They check all that at
the depot
Sam continues fumbling about the Baggees

GUARD 3
(pulling Sam back)
We cant allow you to do that sir

SAM
(shaking Guard off)
Ive got to find her Jill Jill

GUARD A
You can always fill in an
application form if youre a
relative sir Please stop sir

Sam takes no notice

SAM

Guard A hits Sam knocking him out again

GUARD A
Sorry about that sir Regulations

office in no time

INT SAMS OFFICE - EVENING

Sam recovers consciousness to find himself sitting at his
desk in his office He is bruised and battered and has a
black eye His suit is torn and bloody Mr Warren is
gripping him by the throat and giving him a lecture Behind
Warren crowding the doorway are the PEOPLE who circulate
around him and are the cast of the Warren high energy
circus Lime is with them

WARREN
This is a black eye for the
department Lowry And I dont

care how you behaved when you were
at Records Information Retrieval
is an executive branch Were proud
of our reputation and we protect
it

One of his Accolytes thrusts a paper into his hand he
glances at it

He slams the form down onto the desk which is covered with
other forms

And what the hell is this mess An empty desk is an
efficient desk

He has picked up some of the forms
WARREN
Good God queries from Security
searches from Central Banking about
a cheque clarification notices
from Accounting concerning
unreturned receipts another demand
from the Motor Pool

SAM
Mr Warren I have to find out
about

WARREN

Shut up I dont know whats going
on here Lowry but dont think
you can intimidate us with your
friends and relatives in high
places Now shape up

He dumps the papers and folders onto Sams desk and storms
off with his ENTOURAGE leaving a gleeful Lime in the
doorway

SAM
(grabbing Lime as
he starts to slip
away)
Lime I need to use your computer

LIME

Sorry a bit busy at the moment

(he indicates Sams

smothered desk)
You seem to have quite a lot to do
yourself

(he disappears into

his office)

INT30TH FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY

Sam rushes out of his office after Lime But Lime has
locked his door Sam bangs on the door

SAM
Shit

INT SAMS OFFICE - DAY

Sam storms back into his office Reaching a peak of
frustration he stuffs all his paperwork into the pneumatic
tube and sends it off into oblivion Within seconds it
returns Sam sends it off a second time It doesnt return
a second time periodically something passes through the
tubes causing them to move Sams pneumatic tubes continue
to pulsate pressure building up At this point Sams desk
begins as before to creep through the wall He grabs it
violently He pulls it There is a scream from the other
side of the wall Sam smiles The pneumatic tubes give a
final convulsion and then there appears to be a muffled
explosion outside Sams office door It shakes the whole
building Sam goes to his door and opens it

INT SAMS CORRIDOR - CONTINUATION

Every door in the corridor has been opened by the occupants
of the room All the occupants stick their heads into the
corridor all gazing with Sam at the variously coloured
blizzard of paper which has errupted through the whole
length of the corridor ceiling from which protrudes the
intestines of the pneumatic system

INT JACKS OFFICE CORRIDOR and INFORMATION - EVENING

It is the end of the working day Jack is leaving for home
He is putting on his executive-styled bullet-proof vest

and packing his Secret Connection briefcase As the scene

dishevelled and causing acute sartorial embarrassment to
Jack to is trying to distance himself from him

SAM
Come off it Jack Of course you

EXT MINISTRY OF INFORMATION RETRIEVAL - NIGHT

Sam is leaving the Ministry of Information Retrieval The
lights in the foyer are blazing behind him the street
lamps are lit He is exhausted and depressed and anxious
about the safety and whereabouts of Jill He begins to
retrace their first journey together down the Ministry
front steps and around the corner to where Jills truck
was parked

EXT JUST AROUND THE CORNER - NIGHT

Sam stands in the passageway where Jills lorry was first
parked The only hint of its once-upon-a-time presence is

a small splodge of oil by the kerb Sam stands lost and
beaten under a street light He slumps down to the pavement
unsure his next move The street light is reflected in the
pool of oil As he stares at the reflected light it expands
and becomes a patch of blue cloud-filled sky Sam turns to
look at the actual street light It has become a crack of
blazing light coming thru the inner wall of the great stone
ship

INT STONE SHIPANTI - DAY

DREAM GIRLS VOICE
Im here Sam Dont give up

Sam is pushing through the grey Prisoners The light from
the crack shafts across the space in which they find
themselves imprisoned striking the opposite wall There
in the bright pool of light are Sams wings beautiful
shimmering silver But nailed to a large stone cruciform
like a crucified eagle Sam rushes towards them and begins
to pull them loose But before he can a great cracking
noise reverberates through the ship and a black shadow
falls across Sam and the wings Looking round he sees the
inner wall has split open to the level of the floor but
blocking the opening is the Giant Samurai Warrior Sam
draws his sword and rushes toward the Giant The Giant
stands ominously still Then very slowly he raises his
spear in front of himself in an almost religious gesture
Poof He vanishes Sam is confused Suddenly a Prisoner
outs a warning and Sam spins round just in time to avoid
slash of the spear by the gigantic Warrior who is now
tanding directly behind him Sam parries a couple more
rusts of the spear and then strikes with his sword At
in air The Giant has vanished again Sam cant figure
t out But he hears something whoosh and instinctively
odges as the Giant who is once again behind him brings

e spear crashing down Again Sam manages a few parries

e is forced backwards He trips and falls to the ground
e spear goes into the ground

a

Het Oorettnoa

Before the Giant can wrench the spear loose Sam slashes
at him with his sword But again the Giant disappears Sam
spins around The Giant is a short distance from him Sam
rushes him Again he vanishes This time he reappears next
to the spear and tries to free it But Sam attacks again
and the Giant is forced to do his vanishing act before he
can recover the spear Sam is becoming exasperated with
his behaviour and as the Giant reappears he shouts at him
to hold still at the same time throwing his sword at the
big fellow The sword pins the Giants foot to the ground
before he can disappear Instead of blood pouring from the
wound fire issues forth Sam takes advantage of the
situation and manages to wrench the spear from the ground
The Giant is unable to escape as Sam charges but manages
to dodge a bit However the spear catches his arm and opens
a gash Again fire pours out As the big guy tries to stop

the fire Sam charges again This time he succeeds in
striking dead centre The Giant gasps as fire gushes from
his chest He staggers and crashes to the ground The wounds
continue to bleed fire

Sam gets his breath back and approaches the fallen Warrior
Reaching down he removed the Giants mask Fire rushes
forth from all the facial orifices But the thing that
makes him catch his breath is the face itself Its his
Sams While he stares in amazement the fire begins to
melt the face In a moment it is unrecognizable Sam stands
there stunned Somewhere in the distance a bell tolls

EXT JUST AROUND THE CORNER - NIGHT

Sams face is reflected in the puddle of oil He is staring
wide-eyed A church bell tolls in the distance Sam is
definitely spooked He scrambles to his feet Hes got to
get out of here He heads off down the passageway but is
brought quickly to a halt There in the shadows is SOMEONE
smoking a cigarette He hesitates and reverses direction
but before he manages 2 paces a familiar voice comes from
behind him

JILL
Youre late

Sam spins around Stepping out from the shadows is Jill
cigarette in her mouth

SAM
(stunned)
Jill What are you do I mean
how did you Are you alright
JILL
Yes
SAM

What happened to you after

JILL
Your face are you hurt

SAM
No No Im fine I was worried
sick about you I thought

A patrol car approaches Quickly Sam grabs Jill and goes
into a kiss to explain their presence The car hesitates
for a moment and drives on

JILL
(through kiss)
Theyre gone

SAM
(through kiss)
Are you sure

JILL
(through kiss)
Yes

They resume passionate kiss After a moment

SAM
(urgently)
Cmon weve got to get you off
the streets

They head off clutching one another
INT SAMS CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The Elysian Fields train arrives clattering Sam and Jill
are the only passengers to emerge They cant keep their
hands off one another This is young love at its freshest
and most exciting Sam looks up and down the platform
cautiously but there is no-one in sight as the train
clatters off again into the darkness Sam and Jill approach
Sams front door He puts a key in the door and tries to
open the door but has some difficulty Something creaks

He gives the door a heavy shove and the door opens anda
shower of white powdery ice falls on his head

INT SAMS FLAT - NIGHT

Sam enters followed by Jill His breath immediately starts
come out of his mouth like clouds of steam The flat looks
as though it has been disembowelled and then deep frozen
Icicles are hanging down from everywhere The flat looks
like a scrap dump Every wall has spilled out its disgusting
steel and rubber entrails filling most of the available
space and making progress through the flat difficult Half

a dozen MEN are at work They are impossible to identify
because they wear arctic clothing and look more like
spacemen Their voices however belong to Spoor and Dowser

SAM
For Gods sake whats happened

SPOOR
Thermostats gone And then some

DOWSER
And then some

SAM
What have you done to my flat

SPOOR

Spoor offers a clipboard and pencil He bangs the clipboard
against the furniture to knock the ice off it

SAM
What is it

SPOOR

DOWSER

JILL
(to Dowser)

Sam grabs the clipboard and smashes it over Spoors head
The board is so cold that it snaps in two The paper on it
also snaps in two

INT SAMS CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Sam pulls Jill out into the corridor

JILL
Dont you like parties

As Sam and Jill begin to move down the corridor they see a
cigarette glow brightly in a dark recess

JILL
(seeing cigarette
light)

TUTTLE

INT MOTHERS CORRIDOR - NIGHT
A venerable Porter carrying a single key on a large ring

is preceding Sam and Jill along the corridor which we have
seen before The Porters name is MATTHEWS

INT INFORMATION RETRIEVAL FOYER - NIGHT

Sam arrives at the Ministry of Information Retrieval
reception Its late GROUPS OF CLEANERS are operating
cleaning machinery Sam approaches the Desk Porter who is
playing with the executive toy Sam gave him

SAM
Excuse me Dawson can you put me
through to Mr Helpmanns office

PORTER
Im afraid I cant sir You have
to go through the proper channels

SAM
And you cant tell me what the
proper channels are because thats
classified information

PORTER
Im glad to see the Ministrys
continuing its tradition of
recruiting the brightest and best
sir

SAM
Thank you Dawson

Sam crosses the foyer checks to see that Dawson is no
longer watching him engrossed as he is with the executive
toy and slips past the lift which at that moment
disgorges a leg-bandaged be-crutched Lime who hobbles
across the lobby without seeing Sam who slips down the
stairs which he knows lead to Helpmanns private lift

INT BASEMENT - NIGHT

Sam creeps along the corridor to the lift door avoiding a
GROUP OF SECURITY MEN who are singing carols in close
harmony ONE GUARD is conducting and giving instruction
They are all incredibly big and brutal looking

CHOIR MASTER
(stopping them)
No no no Arthur youre going
flat on that G Its your breathing
Take a breath on the end of the
previous line after Noel Right
one two three

The CHOIR begins singing again Sam reaches the lift and
looks at the small panel of letters set into the wall

CLOSEUP of Sams face concentrating He hears we hear a
reprise of Mr Helpmann talking to Sam in Mothers bathroom

HELPMANN (VO)
Of course Jeremiah was senior to
me but we were close friends and
I keep his name alive at the office
every day Its as though hes
there speaking to me Here I am
JH

Sam is already typing the letters EREIAMJH into the
keyboard The lift judders and star s to ascend

INT MR HELPMANNS OFFICE - NIGHT

Sam steps out of lift into an ante-room No-one is there
Tentatively he knocks on the connecting door into the
office No reply He slowly opens door

SAM
Mr Helpmann Are you there Hello

The office is empty Sam looks around not sure what he
wants to do He notices his Mothers picture on Helpmanns
desk He is just about to leave when his eye is caught by
an elaborate computer console in a side room It
occasionally chatters away Paper print-outs fill a large
bin Hesitantly Sam approaches it Looking around to make
sure the room is still empty he punches the On key and the
machine lights up

He cautiously pushes a couple more keys The teleprinter
machines have paused but one starts chattering now He

looks at the one which is busy A CLOSEUP shows us the
message coming through TOTAL TOTAL TOTAL CAR 15 REQUEST
FEEDBACK STATUS ON SUBJECT BENJAMIN GEORGE TROLLOPE VAGRANT
DETAINED TERRORISTSUSPECTASSOCIATE This is followed by

a code number The teleprinter falls silent

Sam returns to the keyboard and switches it off He turns
to leave The teleprinter starts chattering again Sam
stops and goes back to it and looks at the page again A
CLOSEUP shows us UPDATE SUBJECT TROLLOPE DECEASED CAUSE
OF DEATH GUNSHOT RESISTING ARREST PLEASE DELETE FROM
SPECIAL CATEGORY The computer spool revolves back and
forth for two or three seconds and then stops Sam ponders
this for a moment and then heads back to the keyboard and
swtiches on the machine He has he answer

INT MOTHERS FLAT - NIGHT

Sam enters the flat Jill is nowhere to be seen The lights
are out but from the partially opened bedroom door beams

a shaft of bright light Music pours forth it is
BRAZIL
SAM
(cautiously)
Jill

Getting no answer he goes to the door and peers through
There is Jill but transformed She is wearing one of Sams
Mothers wigs which billows in the air blown by a fan She
is also wearing a diaphanous nightdress borrowed from the
extensive wardrobe and is dancing slowly She looks like
the Dream Girl Sam stands open-mouthed Jill notices him
and smiles

JILL
What do you think is it me

SAM
(still stunned)
You dont exist any more Ive
killed you Jill Layton is dead

He holds out a print-out She reads it and slowly looks
up

JILL
Care for a bit of necrophilia
They rush together
INT STONE SHIPANTI - DAY

The screen is filled with brilliant white clouds rushing
about a beautiful blue sky They course this way and that
Pulling back we reveal that this patch of sky is inside a
mammoth glass-like cube held aloft by four stone columns
The absolutely amazing scale of this cube is revealed as
Sam sweeps up into shot his wings gleaming in the light
He is a tiny speck but overjoyed he has found the day
far below him the grey Prisoners gather beaming with
happiness Diving back to the ground Sam unsheaths his
sword and holding it aloft rushes to the base of one of
the great columns The Forces of Darkness who have been
lurking in the shadows slink back Sam with one mighty
swing strikes the column the noise reverberates as cracks
begin to race up and through the column It is
disintegrating As it crumbles the mammoth cube begins to
topple Everyone steps back Down it plummets And smashes
into a million pieces The bright blue sky escapes in all
directions The grey Prisoners iron collars and chains
fall from their necks as they stand surrounded by a
beautiful blue sky They look up to the sun Sam is
exultant

INT MOTHERS BEDROOM - DAWN

Pull back from the sun through a window The light falls
on Sams smiling sleeping face Showly he wakes He little
by little remembers where he is and reaches over for Jill
She isnt there Sam panics

JILL
Merry Xmas

She is sitting at the foot of the bed grinning at him She
crawls over to him they start to embrace

SAM
Everything is going to be all right

But crash Its a raid Like a giant drill a whirling
cylinder has plunged through the ornate moulded ceiling of
Mothers bedroom and we now see what made the neat hole
in the Buttle ceiling CUTS show doors being burst open
by SECURITY TROOPS Jill and Sam are frozen in panic
Security Troops are sliding down a firemans pole from
the hole in the ceiling

SAM
(shouts)
Shes dead Check the list

But it is Sam they have come for He is being dragged out
of the bed

with him)

A canvas bag is plunged over his head All goes black

A shot rings out Jill screams It echoes through the

blackness

INT PROCESSING AREA - DAY

In absolute inky darkness Sam and the CAMERA move through
space and time marked only by voices and sounds encountered
on the way This sound-sequence fades in and out a few
times indicating that the journey is longer than the real-
time period of the blacked-out sequence We hear

Footsteps of Sam and GUARDS
Distant howl of pain
Muzak
Iron gate
Footsteps again
Lift doors opening and closing
Muzak
Typing pool
FEMALE VOICE
a wonderful gift I changed it at
the chemist for some antibiotics
and bathroom scales and theres
enough left on the voucher for a
tonsilectomy if I want to treat
myself
Office door opens and closes
GUARDS VOICE

Christmas Parcel for you sir
sign here please

What looks like a rectangular hatch in the blackness opens
It is the eyeslit on the front of Sams bag being opened

by a SECURITY GUARD
The Security Guard peers in for a moment and then steps
back to reveal two SMART OFFICIALS sitting at a desk They
are looking up at Samus

OFFICIAL A

the following Passing confidential

to disrupt the Ministry of

Ministry time and paper

OFFICIAL B
We would advise you that a plea of
guilty will save you and the tax
payer money and will always be
looked upon more favourably than a
plea of not guilty All you are
requested to do at this stage is
to sign this form

Official B waves a sheet of paper We hear Sams voice

SAM
Wheres Jill

OFFICIAL A
Not interested

SAM
What have you done with Jill
OFFICIAL A
Right Next

The Security Guard appears briefly and zips up the hood
again plunging us back into darkness We get more muffled
shouts heavy breathing and subterranean son et lumiere

Another Security Guard opens the flap on Sams hood We
see another TWO OFFICIALS

SAM
(more hysterical)
Wheres Jill Whats happened to
Jill

OFFICIAL C
93HKS608 youve got quite a
list of misdemeanours here havent
you All this is going to take
time and money and Im afraid
according to your bank statement
and credit rating here youre
likely to be in deep financial
trouble by the end of it Now
either you plead guilty to say
seven or eight of these charges
whichll bring the costs down to
within your reach or you can borrow
a sum to be negotiated from us
at very competitive rates We can
offer you something at say eleven
and a half per cent over thirty
years But you will have to buy
insurance to qualify for his scheme

OFFICIAL D
All you have to do is to agree to
sign the appropriate boxes on these
forms Yes or no

SAM
Im not guilty Not guilty you
stupid bastar

The Guard closes the flap Once again darkness and
confusion until another SECURITY GUARD opens the flap
again to reveal another TWO OFFICIALS

OFFICIAL E

(examining forms)
Now since youve elected to plead
not guilty on all these charges
youd be well advised to take some
sort of insurance cover Preferably
comprehensive or if youd prefer
something more specific say
against electrical charges over
£7000 And for food and
accommodation costs of say £80000
Detention can be a very expensive
business

OFFICIAL F

Now before we bore you with the
small print perhaps youd like to
tell us whether youd like to sign
this insurance acceptance form or
not Think carefully before you
decide Thinking ahead in financial
matters is always the wise course

The flap is closed and opened again very quickly NEW
OFFICIALS are revealed This process repeats again and
again getting faster and faster The Officials faces
seem to become a changing blur Their voices overlap in a
growing cacophony The desk and the other items in the
room remain static To add to this disturbing effect the
Forces of Darkness begin to gather in the room behind the
Officials As they increase in number they begin to press
forward unseen by the Officials Soon they fill the view
through the flap

OFFICIAL
Were here to save you and the tax
payer money Would you like to
pay the premium for a single room
with a shower and a soft bed For
a small charge we can keep visits
from friends and relatives down to
to a minimum Plead guilty its
easier quicker and cheaper for
everyone Were doing a survey
Aimed at providing a better service
Do you think the present system is
A efficient B inefficient As
a taxpayer are you A impressed
B unimpressed

INT STONE SHIP - TIMELESS

CUT TO Sam struggling with the Forces of Darkness He is
overwhelmed by the black hordes They fill the screen Sam
disappears under their onslaught A pause Then Sam is
raised spread-eagled above the black sea of the Forces
Strong hands hold him The maniacal laughter starts up
Sam is turned in its direction

CUT TO a shot over the top of the mass of robed FIGURES
Rising from the ruins of the stone columns the black cloth
thing flaps menacingly towards camera We can see the
towering filing cabinet skyscrapers of the Storeroom of
Knowledge in the background

Sam looks terrified As the thing hovers above Sam in all
its huge twisting awfulness it slowly begine to unfold
like some deadly flower blooming in stop motion

Sam freezes as the interior becomes invisible There in
the billowing blackness is the Girl She is beckoning

GIRL
Sam

But the VOICE is no longer the mysterious feminine voice
of before it is the voice of the maniacal laughter

Sam struggles with the restraining hands He twists and
turns but to no avail From the darkness above him descends
the Jolly Gent looking just like Mr Helpmann) on his window
washers platform However he is now dressed as Father
Christmas

GENT
Sam what are we going to do with
you

GIRL

Ha ha ha ha ha
INT CELL DAY NIGHT

The filing cabinets of the Storeroom of Knowledge dissolve
squares of padding that form the walls of a cell The
laughter echoes round the cell Sam sees that Mr Helpmann
in his wheelchair is watching him He is dressed as Father
Christmas They are alone in the cell Sam scrunches up
into the corner

HELPMANN
Sam what are we going to do with
you Can you hear me Sam

SAM
(in a hoarse urgent
whisper)
Wheres Jill What have you done
to her Where is she

HELPMANN
Gillian Layton

SAM
Yes youve got to get me out of
here Ive got to find her

HELPMANN
I understand Sam I know exactly
how you feel So I brought you a
bottle of barley water

Helpmann holds up a bottle of barley water
SAM
(desperately)
Help me

HELPMANN
I assure you Sam Im doing
everything within my power But
the rules of the game are laid
down and we all have to play by
them even me

SAM
This is all a mistake Dont you

HELPMANN

bit of an own goal but

SAM

HELPMANN
Sam if youve been going out there
and playing a straight bat all
the way down the line youve got
absolutely nothing to worry about

SAM
Please Ive got to find Jill

HELPMANN
Sam I think I ought to tell you
Im afraid shes upped stumps and
retired to the pavilion

Sam looks blank
Thrown in the towel
SAM
(takes a moment to
work this out)
Dead
Helpmann nods
HELPMANN
Yes its all a bit confusing but
it seems she was killed resisting

arrest

SAM
(relieved)
No no I did that

Helpmann looks surprised Sam shuts up

HELPMANN
The odd thing is it appears to
have happened twice a bit of a

disputed call Im afraid
Sam has gone catatonic

HELPMANN

(starting to go)
So there you are All I can say
is dont fall at the last fence
The finishing posts in sight See
you in the paddock Good luck
Keep your eye on the ball Got to
go Cant keep the orphans
waiting

Helpmann goes A GUARD helps him out and then returns with
ANOTHER to help put the restraining bag over Sam

GUARD
Dont fight it son confess
quickly Before they get into

the expensive procedures If you
hold out too long you could
jeopardise your credit rating

The bag blacks everything out

INT INFORMATION RETRIEVAL ROOM - NIGHT

e bag comes off Sam finds himself strapped into an
nformation Retrieval chair The CAMERA tracks back

T

I

frighteningly fast revealing that he chair stands in an
unbelievably vast room The walls curve up and out of sight

The floor doesnt seem to be a floor at all strange light
undulates beneath The whole effect is one of total
disorientation and overwhelming size Sam is desperately
trying to take it in Next to the chair is a porcelain

tray of evil and frighteningly ambiguous instruments
Worrysome electrical connections and meters are near at
hand As the Guards leave Sam to take up their positions
near the distant door they hand over documents to the white-
coated INFORMATION RETRIEVAL OFFICER

GUARD
11AFT607 sir

They all sign the document which the IR Officer retains
after giving carbon copies to the Guards The Guards then
proceed to the door and take up positions on either side
of it The IR Officer heads toward Sam We can now see

he wears a mask It is the face of the Forces of Darkness
A smiling baby doll face Sam sits mesmerized watching
him approach Within fifteen or twenty yards of Sam the
IR Officer comes to an abrupt halt He seems to sway
After a moment he turns slightly hesitantly giving the
impression that he may return to the door He looks at the
Guards pauses straightens himself up takes a deep breath
and continues again towards Sam rather more briskly than
before Sam watches terrified and fascinated The IR
Officer goes to the table which is covered with evil-looking
surgical-type instruments he blunders clumsily into it
knocking a couple of them onto the floor He picks then up
quickly and replaces them

SAM
Jack

The IR Officer reacts to this as if hes been hit in the
solar plexus and he tries to disguise it by simulating a
coughing fit He then picks up a nasty looking implement
and advances on Sam

SAM
Jack Jack

JACK
(hysterically from
behind mask)

Shut up

SAM
Jack Im innocent Help me

JACK
Bastard

SAM
This is all a mistake Jack please

take that mask off

Jack is very close to Sam he is shaking He lifts up his
mask to reveal sweaty face contorted with fear and anger

JACK
You stupid bastard

SAM
What

JACK
How could you do this to me

SAM
Help me Jack Im frightened

JACK
How do you think I feel You shit

SAM
Jack

JACK
(pulling down mask)
Shut up This is a professional
relationship

Jack comes at Sam with the horrifying implement

SAM
JACK You cant No dont

Sams eyes widen in terror From his POV we look up at

Jack approaching The ceiling above and behind Jack is
suddenly and loudly penetrated by the Ceiling Hole Machine
and in an instant without benefit of firemans pole the
commando-like figure of Mr Tuttle gun in hand leaps
through the hole Tuttle is immediately followed by similar
looking MEN with balaclavas guerilla-type clothing and
very efficient guns Jack is cut down So are the TWO GUARDS
who have opened the door from the corridor and are shooting
into the room

Tuttle raps out into a walkie-talkie

TUTTLE
Detonate

From somewhere near at hand there is a large explosion
which rocks the room Tuttle is already unstrapping Sam

TUTTLE
Lets go

INT CORRIDORS - NIGHT

CUT TO RESCUERS with Sam in the middle fighting their
way in the terrific battle with GUARDS until they get to
a door leading to the stairs

INT ENDLESS STAIRWAYS - NIGHT

CUT TO RESCUERS their members thinning and Sam fighting
down flight after flight of stairs with lots of neat-oh
violence and blood and gunshots and falling and bleeding
and

INT INFORMATION RETRIEVAL LOBBY - NIGHT

CUT TO THE RESCUERS fighting their way to the entrance
Another group of RESCUERS at the door are providing cover
fire The Porter sits behind his desk watching the battle
on his bank of monitors
2ND GROUP
Quick Weve only got thirty seconds
to get clear

Tuttle tosses Sam a dark overcoat to cover his light grey
detainee outfit Together the TWO GROUPS burst out through
the door into the large empty forecourt

EXT FORECOURT - NIGHT
The forecourt is suddenly illuminated by huge arc lights

Machine gun installations open fire The rescuers are
totally exposed

ey are cut down left and right Desperately they battle
eir way across the open space Time running out Sam
nowing the way leads Tuttle towards a shielded spot
ill they make it As the last rescuer is cut down Sam and
uttle dive for cover KOWBLAMMPOW A massive explosion
en another And another SECURITY TROOPS caught
nprotected are decimated Sam looks up Christ The
uilding is being blown to bits Certain windows are lit
ey spell out MERRY XMAS With a final massive
haemorrhage the building erupts in a geyser of masonry
steel paper and dozens of TV consoles and visual aid
apparatus including in large chunks Mr Helpmanns
masterpiece But also tons and tons of paper

HOUeHHSAaH

Every file in the building has burst its seams and ejected
its load skywards The night sky is full of white
rectangular wisps Ashlike they flutter down over the city
Sam looks around and cant see Tuttle anywhere He shouts
for him But the remaining Troops have spotted Sam and Sam
runs

EXT CITY PASSAGES - NIGHT
Sam runs madly through paper-littered passages
EXT SHOPPING PRECINCT - NIGHT

Eluding his pursuers Sam dives into a crowded garishly
lit shopping centre Once among the protective company of
he mindlessly shopping MOB Sam slows down and proceeds
casually The SHOPPERS go about their programmed business
paying no attention to the paperwork swirling about them
Searching the crowd Sam spots Tuttle making his way towards
him Tuttle is having a bit of trouble walking against the
steadily increasing wind As he proceeds across an open

area a blown piece of paper catches on his foot He tries
shaking it off

It remains firmly stuck While he is struggling with the
piece of paper another larger piece catches his other

leg He begins to lose his temper trying to dislodge the
flying debris Another hits him and twists around his arm
Still more paper blows against him He is having difficulty
staying upright Twisting this way and that he tries to
free himself but more and more paper covers him He is
practically obscured from view Sam cant believe what he
is seeing Shoppers continue about their business
apparently unaware of TuttleS terrible plight Apart from
ONE SHOPPER who loses control of her shopping trolley and
watches it career down the steps of the shopping precinct
By now Tuttle is totally encased in this cocoon of litter
He is now just a ball of paper writhing about on the ground
Sam has to do something He rushes out from his hiding
place and tries to pull the litter off Tuttle The pieces
come loose with surprising ease The wind carries them
away as Sam frantically tears at the pile But there is no
sign of Tuttle Nothing The last few pieces of paper
flutter away leaving Sam standing there with a couple of
posters in his hands He realises that he is suddenly very
visible All the shopping bustle has stopped They are all
staring at him Sam spots TROOPS shouldering their way
towards him He turns tail and dashes off

INT MOTHERS FLAT - NIGHT

The drawing room door burst open as Sam dashes in Sam
goes straight through and into the bedroom The room is
empty of all terrestrial human life forms A hollow wind
blows the curtains

INT MOTHERS BEDROOM - NIGHT

The room is in chaos (and there is a hole in the ceiling)
Sam turns and sees a silhouette in the doorway He rushes
forwards

INT MOTHERS FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

But its Matthews the porter who is at the door watching
Sam running towards him

MATTHEWS
(piously)
A sad loss Your mother was with
her at the end The doctor said
there was no pain

Sam grabs Matthews round the neck and shakes him

SAM
Where is she

EXT A CORNER - NIGHT

Sam comes running around corner He is suddenly bathed in

a strange blue light He halts and looks up There opposite
him is a large blue neon cross above the entrance to a
chapel of dully modernistic design Holy music from an
electric organ can be heard Sam rushes up the stops and
through the door
INT CHAPEL OF OUR LADY OF THE CHECK-OUT COUNTER - NIGHT

CUT TO Sam slipping into the chapel (in tight spot) and
suddenly being confronted by Spiro the MaitreD

SPIRO
Ah yes Mr Lowry Its so good
you could make it Right this way

Sam dumbfounded follows

CUT TO Sam being lead into the middle of the cold modern
chapel which possibly for the occasion has been tarted
up with some red velvet curtains that help make it a bit
theatrical A large flower-smothered coffin rests on some
sort of raised stand in front of the altar a VICAR stands
in the pulpit and a fair sprinkling of PEOPLE sit in
stepped seats on three sides of the room

The coffin is closed but a length of bandage has escaped
the lid Standing amidst the floral tributes is a large
rather idealized colour portrait of Mrs Terrain looking
not so much young as beautiful Among the mourners are

Drs Jaffe and Chapman and others in their operating gowns

To enlarge on the scene we see Shirley T snuffling in her
hanky and a few others chatting amongst themselves the
Vicar standing in his pulpit waiting to get on with it
etc CUT TO Sam trying to take all this in stopping in
the middle of the room Dont forget Dr Chapman sobbing

SPIRO
(stopping and looking
back at Sam)
Mrs Lowry Mrs Lowry is

In the background the Vicar begins speaking and we hear
his voice throughout the following action CUT TO SAMS
POV

VICAR

(in background)
At these times of giving and
receiving lets remember the
greatest gift of all not a gift
to be spurned not a gift to be
opened and carelessly set on one
side not a gift to be taken back
and changed but the gift of eternal
life Mrs Terrain has just received
that most wonderful of all gifts
She came to us physically new she
goes hence from us not so physically
new But the spirit never grows
old And in the domain of the
Eternal Giver Mrs Terrain shall
dwell in bountiful joy forever

past Spiro to a section in the bleachers directly across
from the coffin and the Vicar where a WOMAN (her back to

well-dressed YOUNG MEN

SFX TERRIFIC CRASH
CUT TO entrance to Chapel as a squad of TROOPS come crashing

in PEOPLE begin to scatter screaming The Troops spot
Sam who dashes away from his Mother and heads for a door
behind the altar In his panic he crashes against the coffin
which topples over spilling its contents a hundredweight
of offal Sam covers his mouth and dashes through the door

EXT MAZE-LIKE DARK PASSAGES - NIGHT

CUT TO Sam really dashing madly tripping over things
hurting himself getting up running He is in a maze of
machinery Every way he turns his path seems blocked by
either Troops or Figures from his dreams The walls of the
maze become more simplified as he goes deeper into it
More rectangular higher We see a top shot of the maze
with Sam separate from the pursuing Forces but they are
closing in on him from all sides The maze extends as far
as we can see Sam turns left and right through it always
there is a chance of turnings Until he rounds a corner
and for the first time there is nowhere to go The maze
leads straight ahead to a dead end At the end of the maze
is a great pile of detritus from the consumer society
Televisions washing machines hair dryers junk Sam can
do nothing but try to dig through this pile

Maybe he can defend himself with something here He
scrabbles away Looking back he sees the massed Agents
Troops Forces of Darkness heading toward him No escape
He digs harder faster Junk flies everywhere He actually
reaches the end wall Back to it he turns to face the

foe But as he moves against the wall his hand touches
something A door knob He turns Its a door The knob
turns easily The door swings open Sam dives through it

INT HABITATION UNIT - NIGHT

Sam finds himself in a strange little house empty of
furniture except a few fitted cupboards and a fitted bed
frame He tries to lock the door behind him but there is

no key He puts his weight against the door to keep it
shut From outside there is the general noise of pursuit
but this fades and resolves itself into a fairly quiet
uniform engine-sound Sam lets go of the door carefully

He looks around but there is only one window and it is
shuttered He carefully opens the door a crack and he sees-

SAMS POV
A rapidly receding street
EXT CITY - NIGHT

Jills truck with the house on its back is driving
dangerously through he streets It lurches round the corner

INT HABITATION UNIT - NIGHT
The lurch throws Sam to one side He picks himself up

and fighting the centrifugal force works his way to the
shuttered window which is at the front end of the house
in the wall opposite the door Sam undoes the shutters and
finds himself looking at the rear window of Jills cab He
sees the back of the DRIVERs head The Driver is wearing
Jills cap He sees the back of the Drivers cab He bangs
on the glass of the cab The Driver raises her head so
that the face is visible to Sam in the driving mirror He
sees that it is Jill in a flat cap She smiles at him
Sam sobs with relief and love

EXT THE ROAD - NIGHT

The lorry travelling slowly now approaches then breasts
the rise beyond which lies looking more than ever
JILLS VALLEY We ZOOM towards it through a MIX

INT TRAVELLING LORRY - NIGHT

Through the windscreen we see the dawn coming up ahead
The reverse shot shows us Jill driving and Sam next to

her They glance at each other

EXT SMALL ROAD - EARLY MORNING

The lorry travelling slowly now approaches and then
breasts the rise beyond which lies A STUNNINGLY BEAUTIFUL
UNTOUCHED VALLEY We ZOOM towards it through a MIX

EXT BEAUTIFUL VALLEY - DAY

Half hidden in the heart of the valley is the truck with

the house on its back Creepers and wild roses have grown

up over the truck and some of the house A curl of smoke
rises from a makeshift chimney which has been attached to
one of the walls A small piece of ground around the truck
has been cleared and made into a pretty garden with a
vegetable plat There is also a pretty cow and some
chickens Jill appears locking like Crusoe carrying a basket
of eggs

INT HOUSE - MORNING

Sam is in the bed just waking up He opens his eyes
locking calm Off screen we hear the door opening

JILL
(off screen)
Morning Sleep well

Sam nods his head slightly on the pillow
SAM
(quietly)
I dont dream anymore

(he embraces her)

EXT HOUSE AND GARDEN - MORNING
A high shot Everything in the garden is definitely lovely
The music tells us The music swells and the camera slowly
pulls back and back Its a happy ending And then in
the foreground TWO HUGE HEADS appear looking straight at
the camera It is Mr Helpmann and Jack They both shake
their heads

MR HELPMANN
Hes got away from us Jack

CUT TO
INT INFORMATION RETRIEVAL ROOM - DAY

Sam is sitting in the IR chair He is strapped in His
eyes are open but miles away His face is wreathed in a
benign and very happy smile

JACK
Im afraid youre right Mr
Helpmann Hes gone

A WIDE SHOT Of the room shows us Helpmann and Lint turn
away and leave Sam is left alone He is humming The
CAMERA PULLS BACK AND BACK The Information Retrieval room
with Sam in it floats away into the most beautiful glorious
sky ever

Sams humming into a full orchestra and we hear

Brazil where hearts were entertained in June We stood
beneath an amber moon And softly murmured Some day soon
We kissed and clung together Then tomorrow was another
day The morning found me miles away With still a million
things to say Now when twilight beams the sky above
Recalling thrills of our love Theres one thing Im certain
of Return I will To old Brazil
