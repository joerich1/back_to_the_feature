BONNIE and CLYDE

David Newman and Robert Benton

FADE IN
INT BEDROOM CLOSE-UP OF BONNIE PARKER DAY

Blonde somewhat fragile intelligent in expression She is
putting on make-up with intense concentration and
appreciation applying lipstick and eye make-up As the
camera slowly pulls back from the closeup we see that we
have been looking into a mirror She is standing before the
full-length mirror in her bedroom doing her make-up She
overdoes it in the style of the time rosebud mouth and so
forth As the film progresses her make-up will be refined
until at the end there is none

The camera pulls back and continues to move very slowly
throughout the first part of this scene As the camera
continues to move away we see by degrees that BONNIE is
naked Her nudity is never blatantly revealed to the
audience but implied That is she should be covered in
various ways from the cameras POV but the audience must
be aware of her exposure to CLYDE later in the scene This
is the only time in the film that she will ever be this
exposed in all senses of the word to the audience Her
attitude and appraisal of herself here are touched with
narcissism

The bedroom itself is a second-story bedroom in a lower-
class frame house in West Dallas Texas The neighborhood
is low income Though the room reveals its shabby
surroundings it also reveals an attempt by BONNIE to fix it
up Small and corny objets dart are all over the tops of
the bureaus vanity tables etc (Little glass figurines and
porcelain statuettes and the like)

BONNIE finishes admiring herself She walks from the mirror
and moves slowly across the room the camera moving with
her until she reaches the screened window on the opposite
wall The shade is up There are no curtains She looks
out the window looking down and the camera looks down with
her

EXT BEDROOM BONNIES POV DAY
Over her shoulder we see the driveway leading to the garage
connected to the house There is an old car parked in the
driveway its windows open We see a man walking up the
driveway somewhat furtively He is a rather dapper fellow
dressed in a dark suit with a vest a white collar anda
straw boater It is CLYDE BARROW Obviously he is about
to steal the car He looks it over checking around him to
make sure no passers-by are coming He peers inside the
front window to see if the keys are in the ignition He
studies the dashboard BONNIE continues watching silently
Finally she calls out

BONNIE
Hey boy What you doin with my
mamas car

EXT DRIVEWAY DAY

CLYDE startled jumps and looks to see who has caught him
Obviously frightened he looks up and his face freezes at
what he sees

EXT WINDOW CLYDES POV DAY

We now see what he is looking at at the open window
revealed from the waist up is the naked BONNIE She looks
down an impudent half-smile on her face She doesnt move
or make any attempt to cover herself

EXT CLOSE-UP OF CLYDE - DAY -

-- whose face changes from astonishment to an answering
smile of impudence (Seeing what he has he realizes that
this girl is clearly not going to scream for the police
Already they are in a little game instigated by BONNIE
sizing each other up competing in a kind of playful
arrogance Before they speak they have become
coconspirators)

Close-up of BONNIE still smiling Finally she speaks

BONNIE
Wait there

INT BEDROOM DAY
Running from the window she flings open a closet and grabs

a dress and shoes She slips on the shoes and flings the
dress on running out the door as she does The camera
tracks with her moving as fast As she runs down the
stairs she buttons up the dress

EXT DRIVEWAY DAY

She flies out the door slamming it behind her runs off the
porch (all this has been one continuous movement since she
left the window in great haste) and continues quickly into
the driveway Four feet away from CLYDE she stops on a
dime They stand there looking at each other smiling the
same challenge For a few seconds no one speaks then

BONNIE
(putting her on)
Aint you ashamed Tryin to steal
an old ladys automobile

CLYDE
(with the same put-on)
I been thinkin about buyin me one

BONNIE
Bull You aint got money for
dinner let alone buy no car

CLYDE
(still the battle of
wits going on)
Now I got enough money for cokes
and since it dont look like youre
gonna invite me inside--

BONNIE
Youd steal the dining room table
if I did

CLYDE

(he moves from his spot)
Come to town with me then Howd
that be

BONNIE
(starting to walk
onto the sidewalk)
Goin to work anyway

EXT STREET MOVING SHOT DAY

The camera tracks It is a hot Texas afternoon all white
light and glare As they walk the block to town in this
scene their manner of mutual impudence is still pervading

CLYDE
Goin to work huh What do you do

BONNIE
None of your business

CLYDE
(pretending to give
it serious thought)
I bet youre amovie star

(thinks)
NoA lady mechanicNoA
maid--
BONNIE

(really offended by that)
What do you think I am

CLYDE
(right on the nose)
A waitress

BONNIE

(slightly startled by

his accuracy anxious

to get back now that

he is temporarily

one-up)
What line of work are you in When
youre not stealin cars

CLYDE
(mysteriously)
I tell you Im lookin for suitable
employment right at the moment

BONNIE
What did you do before

CLYDE
(coolly knowing its effect)
I was in State Prison

BONNIE
State Prison
(she shows her surprise)
CLYDE
Yeah

BONNIE
(herself again)
Guess some little old lady wasnt
so nice

CLYDE
(tough)
It was armed robbery

BONNIE
(sarcastically)
My my the things that turn up in
the driveway these days

They reach the corner and turn They are on
EXT MAIN STREET DAY

--a small-town street of barber shops cafes groceries etc
At the moment it is deserted They continue walking down
the empty street CLYDE looks the place over Tracking

CLYDE
What do yall do for a good time
around here listen to the grass
grow

BONNIE
Guess you had a lot more fun up at
State Prison huh

CLYDE laughs enjoying her repartee They continue walking
At a hydrant CLYDE stops

CLYDE
(showing off but seriously)
See this foot
(pointing at his

right foot)
I chopped two toes off of it With
an axe
BONNIE

(shocked)
What Why

CLYDE
To get off the damn work detail
thats why
(stopping)
Want to see

BONNIE
(a lady of some sensitivity)
No
(turning a cute)
I surely dont intend to stand here
and look at your dirty feet in the
middle of Main Street

They continue walking in silence past a few stores each
planning what next to say

BONNIE
Boy did you really do that

CLYDE
Yeah

BONNIE
You must be crazy

DISSOLVE TO

EXT GAS STATION DAY

Gas station up the block BONNIE and CLYDE are seen leaning
against the soft drink chest their profiles silhouetted by
the bright sun They are drinking cokes As they begin to
talk the camera moves in closer to them CLYDE takes off
his hat and rubs the cold coke bottle across his forehead
BONNIE watches him

BONNIE
Whats it like

CLYDE
Prison

BONNIE
(very interested)
No armed robbery
CLYDE
(he thinks it a silly question)
ItsI dont knowit isnt like
anything

BONNIE
(thinking shes heard
proof that hes a liar)
Hah I knew you never robbed bo
place you faker

CLYDE
(challenged)
Oh yeah
(studies her then
makes up his mind to
show her)

Close-up Gun Day He reaches in his jacket and pulls
out a gun The camera moves to a closeup of the gun
glinting in the sunlight

EXT STREET DAY

The camera pulls back to show BONNIE looking at it with
fascination The weapon has an immediate effect on her
She touches it in a manner almost sexual full of repressed
excitement

BONNIE
(goading him on)
Yeah well you got one all right I
guessbut you wouldnt have the
gumption to use it

CLYDE
(picking up the
challenge proving himself)
You just keep your eyes open

EXT LITTLE GROCERY STORE ACROSS THE STREET DAY
The camera remains just behind BONNIEs shoulder so that
throughout the following scene we have BONNIE in the picture

looking at what we look at

CLYDE goes into the little store We remain outside with
BONNIE watching For a minute nothing happens We can
barely see what is going on in the store Then CLYDE comes
out walking slowly In one hand he holds the gun in the
other a fistful of money He gets halfway to BONNIE and
smiles broadly at her a smile of charm and personality

She smiles back The moment is intense as if a spark has
jumped from one to the other Their relationship which
began the minute BONNIE spotted him in the driveway has now
really begun CLYDE has shown his stuff and BONNIE is
turned on

Suddenly the old man who runs the grocery store comes
running out into the street completely dumbfounded He
stands there and says nothing yet his mouth moves in silent
protest CLYDE points the gun above him and fires It is
the first loud noise in the film thus far and it should be a
shock The old man terrified runs back into the store as
fast as he can CLYDE quickly grabs BONNIEs hand The
camera swings with them as they turn and begin to run down
the street A few yards and the stores disappear entirely
The landscape turns into that arid flat and unrelieved
western plain that begins where the town ends

EXT STORE AT THE EDGE OF TOWN DAY

A car is parked at the back of the store As soon as they
reach it CLYDE motions and BONNIE gets in CLYDE runs to
the front lifts up the hood and crosses the wires to make
it start As he stands back BONNIE calls to him

BONNIE
Hey whats your name anyway

CLYDE
(he slams the hood)
Clyde Barrow

He runs over to the door opens it shoves her over and
starts up the engine The entire sequence is played at an
incredible rapid pace

BONNIE
(loud to make
herself heard over
the gunning motor)
Hi Im Bonnie Parker Please to
meet you

EXT ROAD DAY
VROOM The car zooms off down the road doing 90 The fast
country breakdown music starts up on the sound track going
just as fast as the car

EXT CAR DAY

The car still speeding further down the road We zoom
down and look in the rear window CLYDE is driving we see
from behind BONNIE is all over him biting his ear
ruffling his hair running her hands all over him--in short
making passionate love to him while he drives The thrill
of the robbery and the escape has turned her on sexually

EXT CAR ANOTHER ANGLE DAY

The camera pulls back and above the car The car starts to
go crazy in a comical fashion manifesting to the audience
just what is happening to the driver controlling it The
car swerves all over the road The car comes to a sudden
halt The car starts again It swerves this time almost
right off the road before it straightens out It jumps and
jerks Another car comes down the road the other way and
CLYDEs car swerves so much as to make the other guy drive
right off the road into the dirt It is almost Mack Sennett
stuff but not quite that much

INT CAR BONNIE AND CLYDE DAY

BONNIE grabs the wheel and turns it sharply

EXT CAR DAY

It hairpins off the road onto a shoulder beneath some trees
INT CAR BONNIE AND CLYDE DAY

--still settling to a stop BONNIE and CLYDE appear to be
necking heavily now punctuated by BONNIEs squeals of
passion as she squirms and hops about like a flea trying to
get to CLYDE The floor gear-shift is keeping their bodies
apart however In exasperation BONNIE takes the gear
shift and shoves it forward out of their way She plunges
onto CLYDE burying him from view

BONNIE
(kissing biting)
»You ready

CLYDE
(muffled laughing)
Hey wait

BONNIE
(giggling herself)
Arent you ready Well get ready

BONNIE has obviously touched him With savage coquetry she
tears into her clothes and his

BONNIE
(muffled)
Cmon honey cmon boylets
golets
CLYDE
(muffled)

Heyhey wait a minutequit
that now cut it out

(sharply)
I said cut it out

He shoves her rudely away slamming her into the far car
door Suddenly it looks as if theyve been fighting Both
unbuttoned and unglued they stare silently at one another
breathing heavily CLYDE gets out of the car clearly
shaken Despite the fact that he may have encountered this
situation many times before its one that no twenty-one-
year-old boy in 1932 is sophisticated enough to dismiss
easily with bravado

BONNIE remains seated in the car She seems terribly
vulnerable She fumbles about for a cigarette too confused
to figure out what didnt happen CLYDE turns back and
reaches through the car window from the drivers side
lighting it for her BONNIE casts CLYDE a fishy stare then
accepts the light

CLYDE
(trying to be casual
even insouciant)
Look I dont do that Its not
that I cant--
(his voice cracks
the match burns his
fingers and he bangs
his head onto roof of
car and he goes
right on)
--its just that I dont see no
percentage in it
(MORE )

CLYDE (CONTD)
I mean theres nothin wrong with
me I dont like boys

BONNIE doesnt know what she thinks and CLYDE is trying to
gauge her reaction--whether she feels rejected or repelled
In fact its both--along with a little latent fascination

BONNIE
(finally spitting
out smoke)
Boyboyboy

CLYDE
(a little annoyed)
Boy what
BONNIE

Your advertising is dandy Folksd
just never guess you dont have a
thing to sell

(a little afraid)
You better take me home now

CLYDE
(getting back into car)
Wait

BONNIE
Dont touch me

She gets out of car leaving CLYDE draped across the front
seat reaching after her

CLYDE
(almost shouting)
If all you wants stud service
then get on back to West Dallas and
stay there the rest of your life

This stops her Now CLYDE pours it on with an almost
maniacal exuberance that becomes more controlled as he gets
control of BONNIE

CLYDE
But youre worth moren that a lot
more and you know it and thats
why you come along with me You
could find a lover boy on every
corner in town and it doesnt make
a damn to them whether youre
waiting on tables or picking
cotton so long as you cooperate
But it does make a damn to me

BONNIE
(turning intrigued)
Why

CLYDE
Why Because youre different
Youre like me and you want
different things

BONNIE is hooked now

CLYDE

(continuing)
You and me travelin together we
could cut clean acrost this state
and Kansas too and maybe dip into
Oklahoma and Missouri or whatnot
and catch ourselves highpockets and
a highheeled ol time We can be
somethin we could never be alone
Ill show youwhen we walk into
the Adolphus Hotel in San Antone
you wearin a silk dress theyll
be waitin on you and believe me
sugar theyre gonna know your last
name

He stops having begun to woo her to something more intense
than a casual physical coupling

BONNIE
Whend you figure that all out

CLYDE
First time I saw you

BONNIE
How come

CLYDE
(intensely with real honesty)
Cause you may be the best damn

girl in Texas

BONNIE

INT ROADSIDE CAFE BONNIE AND CLYDE DAY

BONNIE and CLYDE seated in booth now CU CLYDE The sound
track bridges the scene the question that BONNIE has just
asked is now suddenly rebutted by CLYDE as he points a
finger at her

CLYDE
(not answering her
preferring to lead
the conversation)
Ill tell you about you

He loves doing this and he does it well The more he
envisions BONNIEs life the more instinctively accurate he
becomes She grows more and more fascinated like a child
watching a mind reader

CLYDE

LesseeYou were born somewheres
around East Texasgot a big old
family rightYou went to
school of course but you didnt
take to it much cause you was a
lot smarter than everybody else

get away from thisAnd now you
know

BONNIE is half-mesmerized by his talk A waitress comes
with their food A cheap gaudy dame she has spit curls on
each temple in the style of the times CLYDE looks at her
and at BONNIE who also wears spit curls As soon as the
waitress leaves

CLYDE
(pointing at her hair)
Change that I dont like it

Without a word of protest BONNIE immediately reaches in her
bag and takes out a mirror She holds it up and with the
other hand brushes back her spit curls into her hair She
never again wears them When she has pushed them back she
looks at CLYDE for his approval He nods his okay She
smiles puts back her mirror and begins to eat her food
Shes ravenously hungry and eats with total concentration on
her plate CLYDE doesnt touch his food just watches
BONNIE eat for a minute

CLYDE
God youre a knockout

EXT ROADSIDE CAFE DAY FOR DUSK

CLYDE and BONNIE emerge from the cafe into the early evening
They move toward the car they have stolen Just beyond sits
a newer model car BONNIE is surprised to see CLYDE head
toward the newer car

BONNIE
Hey that aint ours

CLYDE
Sure it is

BONNIE
But we came in this one

CLYDE
Dont mean we have to go home in it

She walks amazed around the new car and gets in beside him
He turns the key and they pull away from the cafe

disappear

BONNIE

And modest
CLYDE
Come on Got you all set up over

Wider angle They move around to the side of the building
where CLYDE points to a tire hanging by a rope from a tree
He means that to be BONNIEs target He hands her a gun

CLYDE
Set her spinnin’

BONNIE fires She misses

CLYDE
Again Come down slow with it

BONNIE fires again and hits the tire She smiles and blows
the smoke from the barrel in pride and self-mockery

CLYDE
Aint you something I tell you

Wesson itll be easier in your
hand Now try it again once

BONNIE sights As she is about to fire a man appears
around the corner of the building A FARMER She fires and
hits the tire

FARMER

CLYDE whirls at the sound He grabs gun from BONNIE because
his is empty He aims at FARMER

FARMER
(frightened)
No sirno sir You all go right
ahead
CLYDE watches him warily
FARMER
(continuing)

Used to be my place Not any more
Bank took it

CLYDE and BONNIE start to move toward the farmer All three
move around to the front of the building At a distance we

see an Okie car loaded with belongings A WOMAN with a BABY
in arms sits in front A smaller BOY stands outside the car

FARMER
Yessir moved us off Now it
belongs to them
(He points at the
foreclosure sign)

BONNIE
Well thats a pitiful shame

CLYDE shakes his head sympathetically He loads the empty
gun

FARMER
(bitterly)
Youre damned right mam

He looks up to see an OLD NEGRO who has come from a distance
shack and now stands near CLYDEs car

FARMER
(nodding toward Negro)
Me and him put in the years here
Yessir So you all go right ahead
We just come by for a last look

He stands a moment looking at the house and then turns
around toward his family in the car CLYDE and BONNIE look
after him CLYDE spins and fires three fast shots into the
fore-closure sign The FARMER stops and turns looking at
CLYDE CLYDE offers the gun to the farmer He looks at it
then accepts it He slowly takes aim at the sign and fires
It pleases him He looks at CLYDE and BONNIE who smile

FARMER
You all mind

BONNIE and CLYDE are puzzled

FARMER
Hey Davis Come on over here

The NEGRO moves toward them Now BONNIE understands She
takes the second gun from CLYDE and hands it to DAVIS

DAVIS looks from BONNIE to the FARMER and toward the house
The FARMER fires again This time at a window He nods to
DAVIS DAVIS slowly raises the gun and fires at another
window It shatters and they cant keep from laughing The
FARMER returns the gun as does DAVIS

The CLERK gets the order and puts it in a bag He rings
open the cash register preparatory to asking CLYDE for the
money CLYDE pulls his gun

CLYDE
This is a stickup Ill take all
the money in that drawer now

He reaches over the counter into the cash drawer and grabs
the bills He smiles Suddenly looming beside CLYDE is the
BUTCHER brandishing a meat cleaver Camera looks up at
this formidable sight as the cleaver comes crashing down
missing CLYDE and sticking in the wooden counter He grabs
CLYDE around the chest in a bear hug and actually lifts him
off the ground The struggle is in silence CLYDE is
terrified fighting wildly to get free The gun in CLYDEs
hand is pinned because the man has CLYDEs arm pinned to
his thigh CLYDE tries to raise the barrel at an upward
angle to shoot finally he is able to do so He fires The
bullet enters the BUTCHERs stomach The BUTCHER screams
but reacts like a wounded animal more furious than ever

He still holds CLYDE in a fierce hug staggering around the
store knocking into shelves and spilling cans CLYDE is
hysterical with fear He shoots the BUTCHER again The
BUTCHER falls to his knees but still he doesnt release
CLYDE In a panic CLYDE drags the man to the door trying
to get out

terrified CLYDE drags him out on the street The BUTCHER

The car is speeding down an open road Suddenly it begins
to buck and cough There is something wrong with the motor

CLOSE SHOT CW MOSS EXT FILLING STATION

His cherubic cheeks are puffed up as he blows into the fuel
lines of CLYDEs car There is a distinctly flat sound

Reaction CLYDE and BONNIE CLYDE stands by the hood
BONNIE remains seated in the car CLYDE is covered with
sweat and grease--clearly he has gotten in his licks on the
engine without success Neither he nor BONNIE seems
impressed by the noise CW is making

Another angle CW--as he screws back the fuel line and
moves between BONNIE and CLYDE to the ignition turning the
engine over It purrs beautifully CLYDE is astonished

CW walks away from the car Camera remains where it was
We see him walk inside the gas station office open the cash
drawer close it and come out He emerges with a fistful of
money He walks over to BONNIEs window sticks his hand
inside and drops the money on her lap We see the bills
flutter down Not a word is spoken BONNIE moves over into
the middle CW opens the door and gets in behind the
wheel For a moment we see them all sitting there each
smiling their little smile CLYDE starts to hum a hillbilly
tune quietly The sound track picks it up (banjo and
violin etc) and as the music swells they drive off down
the road

INT HOSPITAL ROOM DAY

A small room with a bed On it covered by a sheet which
humps like a mountain over his enormous stomach is the
BUTCHER His head is propped up on a pillow and he sips a
liquid through a bent glass straw Camera is on the left
side of the head of the bed seeing the BUTCHER in a three-
quarter profile On the opposite side of the bed stands a
uniformed patrolman who is in the act of flashing mug-shot
photos for the BUTCHER to identify his assailant The
lawman holds a stack of them in front of them swiftly
changing the cards like a grade-school teacher with her
flash cards At each picture the BUTCHER grunts negatively
and goes on sipping from his glass straw One picture two
three go by The fourth picture is a mug shot of CLYDE
Again the BUTCHER grunts no without hesitation As the
next picture comes into view we

comes from CW BONNIE drops back on her pillow We cut
close on CLYDE He is awake

INT CAFE DAY

BONNIE CLYDE and CW seated in a booth in a cafe The
Waitress brings the food and serves everybody We see CW
With great concentration as he does everything by relating
to the immediate action he happens to be involved with he
takes the sugar shaker and begins methodically sprinkling
sugar over all his food He sugars the meat the beans and
the beets BONNIE and CLYDE watch this performance with
first amazement and second disgust They cant believe
what they see

BONNIE
(incredulously)

(beginning to eat it)
Why not

BONNIE
Its just disgusting thats why

cW
(chewing)

BONNIE
Butbut it makes everything sweet

CW

With a resigned expression BONNIE turns away and begins to

eat Suddenly a look of consternation crosses CWs face
cW
Damn No mayonnaise

He gets up and goes down to the counter on the other end of
the restaurant out of our vision apparently planning to
put mayonnaise over the sugar The minute he is out of
earshot BONNIE gets CLYDEs attention

BONNIE
Clyde why does he have to stay in
the same room as us

CLYDE seems not to have heard the question He takes up the
sugar shaker and spreads a thin field of sugar on the dark
table surface He will sketch his plan in the sugar

CLYDE

a smile

CLYDE

her face)

This time everyone in the bank hears it The people gasp
and pull back CLYDE slowly edges toward the door and prods
BONNIE forward She carries a paper sack CLYDE motions
her to go from cage to cage and get all of the money

BONNIE begins doing so while CLYDE keeps his gun trained on
everybody We see BONNIE get the money from the first
teller the second teller then

EXT SMALL TOWN STREET DAY

Close-up CW Day--who suddenly looks delighted to see a
parking space

He has to go through the business of backing up cutting the
wheel and all of it The scene is one of pure pandemonium
and chaos

INT CAR

CLYDE
Come on Get it out

EXT CAR DAY

A policeman arrives and begins firing at car CW gets the
car halfway out of the spot scraping fenders in the process
and the car is almost out when suddenly a face looms up at
the window--a dignified white-haired celluloid-collared
man obviously a bank official who has leaped onto the
running board His screaming can barely by distinguished
from all the noise

Stop
CLYDE fires through the window

Close-up (special effects) The face of the man explodes in
blood Then he drops out of sight

EXT CAR DAY

The car shoots off down the road doing ninety Police are
firing at the escaping car BONNIE and CLYDE are shooting
out the back window CW is almost having a nervous
breakdown at the wheel

EXT STREET A MOVIE HOUSE DAY

A police car that had been chasing CLYDE and BONNIEs car
comes down the street It is obvious that the cops have
lost them They are searching the street for a sign of
CLYDEs car They pass a movie house whose marquee reads
GOLDDIGGERS OF 1933 They slow for a moment decide that
is not a probable place to look They drive off
INT MOVIE HOUSE WIDE ACROSS AUDIENCE AT SCREEN

The opening musical sequence of Golddiggers is on the
screen Ginger Rogers sings Were In The Money Among
the audience we cannot make out our three people It is a
small audience and thinly dispersed

ight shot at audience Camera pans the audience while on

he track we hear the music of the song First of our group
ho becomes visible is CW He is staring at the screen and
ating bites from a candy bar in each hand Camera pans
urther and we see that CLYDE is in the row behind CW and
few seats to one side CLYDE is nervous and keeps watching
he entrance doors He is in a rage He shifts in his seat

temo e ate”

CLYDE
Boy you gotta be poor in the head
You Count of you I killed a
man Murderyou too

Shot from behind CLYDE Shooting toward screen

CLYDE
(continuing)
Dumb ass stupid

CW turns to CLYDE and nods agreement This infuriates
CLYDE even more He slaps the back of CWs head

CLYDE
Ever do a dumb thing like that
again Ill kill you boy

Angle at BONNIE She has been watching the movie is now
disturbed by the noise She turns back to CLYDE from her
seat on the aisle

BONNIE
Ssshh If you boys want to talk
why dont you go outside

She smiles at her joke and turns back to the screen to the
movie which she is obviously enjoying enormously

INT CHEAP MOTEL BATHROOM CLOSE-UP BONNIE DAY

On the right of the screen fg BONNIE stands at the sink
fixing her make-up in the mirror The make-up has become
more conservative On the left further back is a bathtub
and in it sits CW His head and knees peek over the gray
soapy water He is engaged with his usual single-minded
concentration in washing himself carefully scrubbing his
arms not a thought in his head BONNIE finishes her make-
up and regards herself quizzically tilting her head to loo
at herself at different angles She is smoking a cigarette
and really studying herself

BONNIE
What do you think of me CW

cW
Uhwell youre just fine I
guess Uh well course youre a
real good shotanduhwell
sometimes you look pretty as a
painting

Camera stays with BONNIE during all this watching her look
at herself as she listens to CWs evaluation She has a
narcissistic concern at the moment and as she hears him
enumerate her values she thinks about each in turn and
decides yes thats true

cW
Hey uh Bonniecould you get me
that washrag there

Responding automatically BONNIE turns and walks to a towel
rack pulls the washcloth off and starts toward CW when
suddenly she stops with a smile on her face and a sudden
motion Teasingly she holds the washcloth out at arms
length

BONNIE
(coyly)
Whynt you come get it

cW
(not even realizing
whats on her mind)
Huh

BONNIE
(wiggling the
washcloth like a
bull-fighters cape)
Whynt you come get it CW

k

Suddenly CW looks mortally embarrassed as he realizes what
that would entail

cW
Aw Bonnie come on gimme it

BONNIE tries another tack She begins sauntering over
slowly teasingly still holding out the treasured washcloth

BONNIE
(pertly)
All right Ill bring it myself

As she moves closer to the tub CW realizes that she will
be able to peer down into the tub and see him and he
frantically reaches up with one hand and yanks the washcloth
into the tub causing a great splash BONNIE somewhat the
victim of the splash jumps back and away Recovering her
composure she looks at CW who is slunk down in the tub
like a gross September Morn She has tried him and he has
failed she realizes now that he was no choice for her no
real man even if he might perform sexually He is a lump
This irritates her his very presence is demeaning to
herself and CLYDE

BONNIE
(irritated with
herself for even
thinking of such a thing)
You simpleton what would you do if
we just pulled out some night while
you was asleep

cW
(trying to give the
right answer but
obviously faking it)
Oh I wouldnt know what to do
But you wouldnt do that You
couldnt now

BONNIE realizes with some weariness the inevitable truth
of what hes said thus resigned she says patronizingly

BONNIE
Thats right CW Well always be
around to take care of you

Pointedly she throws her cigarette in his bath-water
Sssssssssss She turns and leaves the bathroom slamming
the door behind her
INT BEDROOM

Camera goes with her into the connecting bedroom CLYDE is
sitting on the edge of the bed cleaning the guns and oiling
them He is quiet and preoccupied and takes no note of

BONNIEs present condition The moment she enters he looks

up

CLYDE
(quietly)

Bonnie I want to talk to you Sit

down

BONNIE sits a little taken off balance by his serious

manner But she listens quietly

CLYDE
(continuing)

This afternoon we killed a man and
we were seen Now nobody knows who
you are yet but theyre going to
be after me and anybody whos
runnin with me Now thats murder
now and its gonna get rough

(BONNIE nods CLYDE
continues speaking

carefully and gently)
Look I cant get out but right
now you still can You say the
word and Ill put you on the bus to

go back to your Mother
mean a lot to me honey

Cause you
and I

aint going to make you run with me
So if you want you say the word

BONNIE moved by his offer has tears in her eyes

CLYDE
(as he pauses)

Why We aint gonna have a minutes

peace

BONNIE doesnt like him in this mood
out of it

BONNIE
Oh pshaw

CLYDE

She tries to josh him
(trying to make her
see the seriousness
of it)

Bonnie we could get killed

BONNIE
(death has no reality
for her)
Whod wanna kill a sweet young
thing like me

CLYDE
(amused in spite of himself)
I aint no sweet young thing

BONNIE
Oh Clyde I cant picture you with
a halo and if you went to the
other place youd rob the Devil
blind so hed kick you right back
to me

Close-up CLYDE--touched deeply realizes that this was a
lovely thing to say to him

INT MOTEL BEDROOM

They kiss They are near the bed on which are some guns
that CLYDE has been cleaning The kiss moves toward real
love making They are on the bed and push the guns aside
Some fall to the floor CLYDE breaks the embrace after it
has reached a high pitch He moves away from the bed toward
the window BONNIE follows him and embraces him from the
rear They are miserable BONNIE frees him and returns to
the bed She falls on it face down A gun presses into her
face CLYDE sits in the window the light silhouettes him
He turns his face toward the glass and rests his head on the
window pane BONNIE turns to him from bed She smiles a
comforting smile at him She rolls over onto her back The
gun is now under her head and moves it She sits up and
gestures to CLYDE He remains at the window She stares at
him She looks toward the bathroom She looks back at
CLYDE She is moved and pained for him She touches her
cheek with the gun and waits for him to be able to look at
her Finally he does Her look eases him and he almost
smiles

INT BUCKS CAR DAY
Shot of little fuzzy doll tied by a white shoestring to the
rear-view mirror of a car The car is moving the doll is
bouncing up and down In the front seat are BUCK and

BLANCHE BARROW BUCK is a jovial simple big-hearted man

A little chubby given to raucous jokes knee-slapping and
broad reactions He is in many ways the emotional opposite
of his brother It doesnt take much to make him happy
BLANCHE his wife is the direct opposite of BONNIE

She is a housefrau no more and no less not terribly

bright not very ambitious cuddly simpering madly in love
with BUCK and desirous of keeping their lives on the straight
and narrow As the scene begins we hear and then see BUCK
driving singing The Great Speckled Bird BLANCHE is
sitting next to him looking at a movie magazine appearing
fairly miserable

BUCK

(singing)
What a beautiful thought I am
thinking

bird

BLANCHE

is overjoyed to see his brother BUCK jumps out of the car
equally delighted They hug each other

CLYDE
(hugging him)
Buck

BUCK
Clyde You son of a bitch

They laugh happily and begin sparring with each other

faking punches and blocking punches--an old childhood ritual
There is a great feeling of warmth between the two brothers
CLYDE is more outgoing than we have ever seen him before

CLYDE
Hows ma Hows sister
BUCK
Just fine just fine Send their

CLYDE

Clyde who loves

Bucks jokes)

her face obscured by the glint of sun on the windshield
Slowly she gets out of the car still carrying the movie
magazine

BLANCHE
(suspiciously quite
the grand lady)

Howdy-do

CLYDE
(shaking her hand)

BUCK beams with pleasure thinking they must like each other
BONNIE comes out of the cabin standing on the steps The

and CW comes out dressed in his long underwear BLANCHE
can hardly stand it

CLYDE
Everybody this is CW Moss
CW my brother Buck and his wife
Blanche

cW
(friendly)
Heighdy yall

He pumps BUCKs hand vigorously and then goes to BLANCHE
With his characteristic one-track intensity he decides to
act just as friendly as he can with BLANCHE ignoring the
fact that hes standing there in his underwear BLANCHE
however is not ignoring it

CW
Well how do Mrs Barrow Or can I
call you Blanch I sure am pleased
to meet you
(shaking her hand

Blanche is slowly

going crazy with mortification)
Did you have a hard time findin us
here in this neck of the woods
Well you sure picked a good day

Shes my favorite picture star

BLANCHE is starting to edge over to BUCK in sheer panic at
this strange young man in his BVDs but CW takes no
notice of it

BLANCHE finally grabs BUCKs arm BONNIE watches it all
smirking

BUCK
Hey lemme get the Kodak

BUCK goes to his car and gets a folding Brownie camera

CLYDE
(lighting up a cigar)
Hey CW go put your pants on

cabin BUCK pushes BLANCHE and CLYDE together posing them
for a picture

BONNIE

brother

BLANCHE

(getting kittenish
and overdoing it)
Buck Dont take my picture now

BUCK
Oh honey now you look real fine
BONNIE watches BLANCHEs behavior with hardly-veiled disgust
BUCK snaps the picture as BLANCHE is just about to move out
of it

BLANCHE
(with unbecoming
girlish outrage)
Did you take my picture Oh Buck
I declare--

BUCK laughs and goes to BONNIE takes her by the arm and
moves her next to CLYDE and BLANCHE He lines them up
steps back and takes their picture CLYDE is the only one
smiling

CLYDE
(pulling out his gun
and posing like a
movie tough)
Hey Buck get one of this

missus

He puts his arm around BLANCHE CLYDE takes the picture

the bedroom A little puzzled CLYDE follows

INT BEDROOM

BONNIE closes the door and immediately begins fussing with
CLYDEs hair doing a scathing imitation of BLANCHE Though
her miming expresses her irritation at being closeted with
the Barrow menage it is also a peach doing an imitation of
a lemon--and it is disarmingly sensual Indeed the mimicry
allows BONNIE to be physically freer with CLYDE and allows
CLYDE to respond without anxiety without self-consciousness
We should have the distinct--if momentary--feeling that
CLYDE could suddenly make it with BONNIE

BONNIE

(doing an unmerciful imitation)
Oh Daddy you shore need a haircut
You look just like a little old
hillbilly boy I do declare

(she has her other

hand toying with the

buttons on his shirt

her hand slipping

under fluttering

across his bare chest)
Oh mercy me oh my stars

CLYDE laughs and BONNIE tugs at the shirt--she kneels on
the bed over CLYDE who quite easily drapes across it

BONNIE
(a little louder)
Oh Daddy Yore such a slowpoke

Shes letting her hair fall loose its golden ends brushing
up and down CLYDEs body

CLYDE
(amused but cautionary)
Hush up a little Theyre in the
next room

BONNIE
(a mock-pout but
with an edge to it)
Shoot theres always somebody in
this room the next room and ever
other kind of room

CLYDE has his arm around BONNIE and shes almost draped
across him--but in the direction of the length of the bed
so their bodies almost form a crooked cross She digs an
elbow into his stomach

CLYDE
Oofnow that aint no nice way
to talk about my brother

BONNIE
(imitating Blanche
again with baby talk)
I aint talking about your brother

Suddenly BONNIE straightens up to a kneeling position again
and cocks her head When she speaks now it is with a simple
plaintiveness

BONNIE

Honey do you ever just want to be
alone with Me

(sensing Clydes

sensitivity to the

sexual implication)
I dont just mean like thatI
mean do you ever have the notion of
us bein out together and alone
like at some fancy ball or I
dont know where we walk in all
dressed and they announce us and
its fancy and in public but were
alone somehow Were separate from
everybody else and they know it

CLYDE looks up to BONNIE affectionately He runs his hand
carelessly down her body

CLYDE
I always feel like were separate
from everybody else

BONNIE
(its terribly
important to her)
Do you baby

Suddenly there is a ring at the door BONNIE and CLYDE
freeze

INT LIVING ROOM

BONNIE and CLYDE run out into the living room camera going
with them

BONNIE
(to all)
Quiet Ill get it

BONNIE goes down the stairs and reaches the front door

BONNIE
Who is it

VOICE
Groceries Mam

EXT GARAGE APARTMENT

She opens the door A young man is there with the two big
sacks of groceries

BONNIE
How much

YOUNG MAN
Six dollars and forty-three cents

BONNIE pays him and goes to take the bags from him

YOUNG MAN
Here Mam them bags is heavy
Let me carry em up for you

BONNIE
(curtly)
No thanks Ill take ‘em

She takes the heavy bags and hefts them up and turns and
walks up the stairs They are obviously very heavy for her
Closeup the delivery boys face looking puzzled at this
behavior BONNIE reaches the top steps and voices are heard

BUCKS VOICE
What was it

CLYDES VOICE
Quiet Open the door

BONNIE
Cmon cmon

Close-up The DELIVERY BOY A look of suspicion comes
across his face
DISSOLVE TO
INT GARAGE APARTMENT
Close-up of BONNIE--seated in the living room

BONNIE

(reading from a pad

in a recital voice)
Its called The Ballad of Suicide
Sal

(she pauses for

effect then begins)
We each of us have a good alibi
For being down here in the joint
But few of them really are justified
If you get right down to the point
Youve heard of a womans glory
Being spent on a downright cur

BUCKS VOICE (0S)
You write that all by yourself

BONNIE
You want to hear this or not

As she reads the camera pans around the room picking out
everyones reaction CLYDE is looking and listening
seriously BUCK is grinning CW is blank BLANCHE is in
the kitchen cooking

BONNIE
Still you cant always judge the
story
As true being told by her
Now Sal was a gal of rare beauty
Though her features were coarse and
tough--

BUCK
Yeah I knew her She was cockeyed
and had a hare-lip and no teeth

BONNIE flashes him a look that could kill He shuts up fast
She continues

BONNIE
Now Sal was a gal of rare
beauty
Though her features were coarse and
tough

She never once faltered from duty
To play on the up and up

Still listening CLYDE gets up from his chair and walks
slowly past the living room windows The camera angled
slightly above him sees down the street We see two police
cars quietly pulling up One of them parks sideways in the
driveway to block escape from the garage the other stays on
the street CLYDE turns and looks out the window

BONNIE

(oS as we see out

the window)
Sal told me this tale on the
evening
Before she was turned out free
And Ill do my best to relate it
Just as she told it to me--

CLYDE
(seeing it)
Its the law

As soon as CLYDE calls out BLANCHE drops the frying pan on
the floor and begins screaming Camera cuts back to the
living room Everyone else leaps into action Guns begin
blazing from everywhere we rarely see who is shooting at
whom

EXT GARAGE APARTMENT DAY

The police down the stairs into the garage--we follow them
with a hand-held camera tracking rapidly

EXT STREET DAY

BLANCHE however in utter panic just runs right out the
front door and begins running down the quiet residential
street going nowhere anywhere

EXT GARAGE APARTMENT DAY

BUCK crouching shooting with one hand gets the garage
door open A policeman fires BUCK fires back and the cop
falls dead in the street BUCK firing dashes to the
police car blocking their escape and releases the hand brake
CLYDE BONNIE and CW leap into their car gun the motor
still shooting madly Two more police fall dead or wounded
One policeman is hurled through a fence by the blast of a
sawed-off shotgun BUCK jumps into the car with the others
They now begin to bump the police car with their car The
police car picks up speed as they push it and it tears into
the street right at the group of firing police The gangs
car turns into the street toward the running BLANCHE

BONNIE and CLYDE are in front BUCK and CW in the back
seat firing back at police The car pulls alongside the
wildly running BLANCHE the back door is flung open and in
almost the style of a cartoon two hands reach out and lift
her off her feet and pull her into the car They speed away

CUT TO
INT CAR DAY

The inside of the car still speeding BLANCHE is hysterical
CW is still firing out the window The pursuing police
cars driver is shot and the car crashes into a tree The
gang is not being pursued now but CLYDE is driving at 90
BLANCHE is moaning and crying BONNIE in front turns
around furiously

BONNIE
Dammit you almost got us killed

BLANCHE
(crying)
What did I do wrong I spose
youd be happier if I got shot

BONNIE
(at her bitchiest)
Yeah it would of saved us all a
lot of trouble

BLANCHE
Buck dont let that woman talk to
me like that

BUCK
(caught in the middle
of a bad situation
knowing Blanche is
wrong but trying to
soothe her)
You shouldnt have done it Blanche
(quietly cont)
It was a dumb thing to do

BLANCHE
(switching tactics)
Please Buck I didnt marry you to
see you shot up Please lets go
Lets get out of here and leave
Make him stop the car and let us out

BUCK
(still quietly)
Cant I killed aman Were in
this now

BLANCHE
(loud and shrill)
Please Please

BONNIE
(exploding)
Shut up Just shut up your big
mouth At least do that will ya
just shut up

CLYDE
Cut it out Bonnie

BONNIE is affronted BLANCHE continues sobbing

BONNIE
(curtly)
Stop the car I want to talk to you

Without a word CLYDE stops the car

EXT ROADSIDE DAY

BONNIE and CLYDE get out and walk fifteen feet away from the

car

Both are irritated and touchy

CLYDE
(coldly)
What is it
BONNIE

Get rid of her

CLYDE
Cant do that Shes Bucks wife

Camera follows them
BONNIE
(snapping her words)
Get rid of both of them then

CLYDE
Why Whats the matter with you
anyway

BONNIE
Shes whats the matter with me a
damn stupid back country hick
without a brain in her head
(contemptuously)
She aint nothin but prunes and
proverbs

CLYDE
(really pissed-off at Bonnie)
What makes you any better What
makes you so damn special Youre
just a West Dallas waitress who
spent half your time pickin up
truck drivers

BONNIE

(raising her voice)
You talk to me like that Big
Clyde Barrow just the same as your
brother an ignorant uneducated
hillbilly

(with deadly archness)
Only special thing about you is
your peculiar ideas about
lovemakin--which is no love makin
at all

This hits home with BONNIE He has said the unforgivable

CLYDE stiffens The two of them stand silent and tense
almost quivering with anger They have stripped each other

raw CLYDE turns and looks back at the car

Everyone is

waiting watching them He breathes a deep sigh like a man

counting to 10 to hold his temper

CLYDE
Look Bonnie--

He cant finish
Close BONNIE She drops her head into her hand for a
moment comes up a little more relaxed She looks at CLYDE
and her eyes reflect the realization of the pain she has
inflicted on him She softens

BONNIE
ClydehoneyI didnt mean all
that honey Blame it on all that
shootin I just felt so badsure
enoughClyde

CLYDE
OkayOkay honlets get
movin

He turns and begins walking back to the car BONNIE walks
alongside him On the few steps back she regains all her
dignity and acts aloof from the others waiting for her She
reaches the car CLYDE opens her door for her and she gets
in like a great lady He walks around to his side gets in
and they drive off

WIDE SHOT EXT CAR DAY

A very wide shot We see CLYDEs car driving along a wooded
road For a moment that is all we see then we should
become aware that far in the distance another car is
following CLYDEs

Close Rural mail box On the opposite side of the road
CLYDEs car swings across the road and CLYDE who is driving
snatches a newspaper which protrudes from the box and hands
it into the car They drive out of the shot Camera holds
and soon the following car enters the shot The man driving
is a Texas ranger He drives slowly He drives out of the
shot

INT CLYDES CAR
BUCK is reading from the paper

BUCK
(jubilantly)
Hey yall listen to this here
Law enforcement officers throughout
the Southwest are frankly amazed at
the way in which will-of-the-wisp
bandit Clyde Barrow and his yellow-
haired companion Bonnie Parker
continue to elude their would-be
captors Since engaging the police
in a gun battle on the streets of
Joplin Missouri and slaying three
of their number

BLANCHE
Oh Lord

We notice CLYDE is wincing

BUCK
the Barrow gang has been reported
as far West as White City New
Mexico and as far north as Chicago
They have been credited with
robbing the Mesquite Bank in the
aforementioned White City the JJ
Landry Oil Refinery in Arp Texas
the Sanger City National Bank in
Denton Texas on three different
occasions In addition to these
robberies the fast travelling
Barrows have been rumored to have
had a hand in the robbing of two
Piggly Wiggly stores in Texas and
one AandP store in Missouri though
Chief Percy Hammond who first
identified Clyde Barrows brother
Buck as a member of the gang
expressed some doubt that these
last robberies were committed by
the Barrow Gang alone

BONNIE
Go on

cW
(finally)
Clyde we aint goin to see a
restroom for another thirty miles
Why dont you just stop here

CLYDE looks relieved

EXT WOODED AREA DAY

He pulls the car to a stop gets out and goes off into the
woods We watch him vanish behind the trees
INT CAR
BUCK still scanning the newspaper

BUCK

(with a laugh)
Hey now heres something Listen
here Lone Cop Arrests Two Officers
In Hunt For Barrow Police Officer
Howard Andersons heart turned
faster than his motorcycle when he
forced to the side of the road a
roaring black V-8 sedan in which
were three men and a blondheaded
woman yesterday afternoon

Everybody laughs As BUCK continues to read his voice
remaining on the soundtrack

EXT CAR

The camera goes outside the car and pulls back way back to
reveal a police car quietly driving up behind the car The
car stops a good distance away and one man gets out the
only occupant of the car He is tall dressed in the
uniform of the Texas Ranger He draws his gun and slowly
approaches the car from the rear On the soundtrack BUCKs
voice continues as we see all this taking place

BUCK

When he saw several machine guns in
the car he was certain hed caught
Clyde Barrow Bonnie Parker and
maybe Buck Barrow and the third
unidentified member of the gang
It took a lot of telephoning and
explaining to convince the
motorcycle cop that his captives
were two highway patrolmen and a
blonde-haired stenographer from the
Highway Patrol-- Haw Haw

(everybody busts up

with laughter)

In the meantime on screen the lawman is slowly approaching
the back of the car Suddenly cut to shot of CLYDE coming
out of the woods behind the lawman His gun is tucked in
his pants In a second he sees what is happening

BUCKs voice is continuing

BUCK
Anderson was held up as an example
for every other Texas peace officer
today That was a mighty brave
thing explained Highway Patrol
Chief LC Winston

CLYDE whips out his gun The following scene is played
exactly like a classic fast-draw in an heroic Western

CLYDE
Sheriff

BRYCE spins around Both men fire instanteously but CLYDE
has the draw on him and the aim The gun goes flying from
the SHERIFFs hand A really razzle-dazzle display of
grandstand marksmanship from Clyde

Immediately the gang leaps from the car and surrounds the
man guns drawn

cW
Boy What a shot Clyde

BUCK
Sweet Jesus I never seen shootin
like that

The gang grabs the man and takes his handcuffs from his belt
CLYDE makes him lean on the cars hood arms extended legs
spread while he frisks him In general everyone is
excited over the capture BONNIE takes the sheriffs gun
and delicately places it on the radiator grill like an

object dart

CLYDE
(examining the mans
wallet really surprised)
Well now getta load of this I
want yall to know we are in the
custody of Capn Frank Bryce and
Frank here is a Texas Ranger

Rev angle across hood--so BRYCEs face not visible to
CLYDE or anyone else behind him is in foreground His
gnarled powerful hands tremble slightly on the hood as tho
they might crinkle the metal like so much tissue paper His
eyes stare toward camera relentlessly unblinking but
without passion They are sharks eyes They have witnessed
much carnage devoured it and are still wide open for more

cW
Sure nough Clyde

BUCK
Say there peacemaker I believe
you got your spurs all tangled up
Youre in Missouri you know that

CLYDE has been going thru the mans credentials Not so
pleasantly

CLYDE
You didnt know you was in Missouri

cW
Hes lost this here Texas Ranger

CLYDE claps BRYCEs hands behind his back handcuffs him
spins him around

CLYDE

(a little pissed)
--he aint lostthem banks are
offerin extra reward money fer us
and Frank figured on easy pickins
didnt you

(he suddenly knocks

Bryces hat off)
Didnt you

BRYCE flinches involuntarily BUCK suddenly grows wary at
CLYDEs mood CLYDE leans into BRYCE looking up

CLYDE
--Now you aint hardly doin your
job Texas Ranger You oughta be
home lookin after the rights of
poor folks not out chasin after us

He suddenly hefts BRYCEs huge bulk onto the fender

BUCK
(trying to be casual)
Easy there Clyde Why take is so
personal
CLYDE
(to Bryce)
Reglar laws is one thing But
this here bounty hunting we got to
discourage that

BLANCHE looks very uncomfortable She starts to say
something but BUCK intervenes

BUCK
Like how Clyde--

A tense moment CLYDE cant think of anything right away

cW
(trying to be helpful)
Shoot him

BONNIE shoots CW an angry glance--its just what the gang
doesnt want

cCW
(trying again)
hang him

Reaction--BONNIE carefully gauging the moment to intervene

BONNIE
(suddenly)
--uh-uh Take his picture

CLYDEs not sure hes heard right Neither is CW

cW
Take his picture

BONNIE

(pointedly ignoring

CW brightly)
Then well let the newspapers have
it--sos everyone can see Captain
Frank Bryce of the Texas Rangers
with the Barrow gang--

(moving demurely to Bryce)
--and all bein just as friendly as
pie

BUCK

(grasping
possibilities immediately)
yeah yeah

BONNIE

(continuing right on

coyly picking up

Bryces gun from grill)
--why we bout the friendliest
folks in the world Texas Ranger
waves his big ol gun at us and we
just welcome him like hes one of
our own

CLYDE
(grinning widely)
Buck get the Kodak

BUCK
(relieved and excited)
Hot dog

CLYDE
(to Bryce)
Were mighty proud to have a Texas
Ranger in the family

BRYCE is obviously not pleased with this turn of events

Following dialogue is overlapped ad-libbed etc
of mounting glee at the kind of vengeance they are going to

exact

New angle

shot with CLYDE

A sense

BUCK is fiddling with the camera setting up the

bg to CLYDEs speech below it

BUCK
keep him set on the hood
theremore to the sun like
thatyeahwhen all his ranger
friends see thisI bet hes gonna
wish he was dead

CLYDE
(to Bryce)
»see what come o your

BUCKs following speech should be heard

(giggling)

--dont make sense do it

BUCK
Cmon now Clyde you and Bonnie
first Move into him right close
right friendly

CLYDE
All righty
(to Bryce whose
hands are tied
hemmed in by them both)
Dont move now hear

CLYDE grandly puts an arm on BRYCEs shoulder BONNIE
looking up admiringly from the other side BUCK takes the
picture BONNIE immediately hops onto the hood next to
BRYCE

BONNIE
Hows this Captain Bryce and new
found friend

She coyly loosens his tie tousles his hair and plants a
big kiss on him while still ogling camera

CLYDE
yeah yeahquick Buck get
it

BUCK
Im gettin it Im gettin it

Quite suddenly BRYCE whose simmering intensity we should be
more sensitive to than the gang is spits on Bonnie BONNIE
half-screams in disgust but CLYDE is on top of BRYCE in a
flash half-strangling on his own fury He pulls BRYCE off
the fender by the handcuffs spinning him around crazily
like a lasso BRYCE is literally ricocheted off the car by
the force and with CLYDE hanging on by the cuffs plummets
down the embankment to the sandy beach below both men
falling spinning BRYCE rises shakily He tries to walk
away CLYDE grabs him again by the handcuffs and hurls him
out into the water BRYCE smacks into a tree stump poking
out of the shallows and goes down CLYDE is on top of him
Meanwhile BUCK has rushed down into the water tries to
pull CLYDE off BRYCE

BUCK
(frantic)
I got the picture I got the
picture

CLYDE
(oblivious)
Lemme be lemme be

BRYCE reaches the surface and CLYDE tries to throw him into
deeper water He hitches BRYCE over a moldy skiff knocking
aside one of the oars BUCK upends BRYCE into the skiff and
kicks it spinning CLYDE picks up an oar and hurls it like
a boomerang ass over end at the skiff It kicks up a spray

BUCK
(holding tightly to
Clyde yelling)
I got the PICTURE

Reaction CLYDE waist deep breathing heavily

CLYDE
-All right all right
(to Bryce yelling)
WE GOT YOUHEAR REMEMBER
YOU YOUR FACEWE GOT ITWE
GOT YOUWE GOT YOUWE GOT YOU

BRYCE battered and handcuffed stares back with mindless
malice from the lazily spinning skiff to the hysterical
spectre of CLYDE screaming his madness across the water

DISSOLVE

INT BANK

Inside the bank In contrast to the previous inept bank
robbery scene this one goes admirably well the gang
performing slickly and without a hitch As they enter

dripping wet CLYDE makes a general announcement to everyone
to the bank

CLYDE
This is the Barrow gang
(the people turn and freeze)
Everybody just take it easy and
nobody will get hurt

CLYDE covers the door BONNIE and BUCK go to the tellers
cages and get money BUCK goes inside emptying out the
cash drawers Cut to BONNIE filling the sack

Cut to a close-up of a burglar alarm button Slowly a hand
crawls up the wall and a finger slowly moves to push the
button When the finger is about one inch away suddenly a
gun appears in the frame and gently taps the hand away The
camera pulls back to reveal BUCK smiling at a lady teller

BUCK
Dont do nothin silly now

Cut to CLYDE standing near the door training his guns on
the entire bank A farmer stands a few feet away some
bills clutched in his hand

CLYDE
That your money or the banks

FARMER
Mine

CLYDE
Keep it then

Across the floor the bank guard in the corner takes
advantage of CLYDEs distraction to go for his gun CLYDE
spots it and fires a shot that just knocks the bank guards
hat off without harming him

CLYDE
(to the guard who
has practically
frozen in fear)
Next time Ill aim a little lower

They finish robbing the bank They start to exit Near the
door stands a guard with his hands raised He wears sun
glasses of the period As they leave BUCK snatches the sun
glasses from the guards head

BUCK
Get a good look at us Were the
Barrow boys

distance

VELMA
What if they have guns Eugene

EUGENE
(realizing the
possibility he
suddenly stops being

mad and turns chicken)
Wed better get the police and let
them handle this

VELMA
Right

EUGENE
Turn around and lets get back to
town Well go get the sheriff

They are by now on a narrow dirt road and the WOMAN has to
execute a U-turn It takes her about seven cuts to turn the
car around in the narrow space They start back to town

CUT TO
INT BONNIE AND CLYDES CAR
BUCK looks out the rear window

BUCK
They stopped chasin us They
turned around

Close-up CLYDE grinning mischievously

CLYDE
Lets take em

BUCK and CW laugh appreciatively at the reversal CLYDE
turns the car around He performs the U-turn in the same
narrow space in one swift smooth beautiful turn

CUT TO
INT THE OTHER CAR

VELMA looks in the rear view mirror and sees that now she is
being chased

VELMA
Oh my Lord theyre comin after us

EUGENE
(in a panic)
Step on it Velma step on it
Close-up Accelerator VELMA jams it down to the floor
The car speeds

EXT ROAD THE CHASE DAY

BONNIE and CLYDEs car gaining on them gaining on them
gaining on them and finally overtaking them coming up and
ahead forcing them to the side of the road

Med shot The MAN and WOMANs car Terrified they roll
up their windows lock their doors and huddle together

EXT ROAD

The Barrow gang piles out of their car and walks over
having a merry time They surround the car and press their
faces against the window flattening their features making
menacing gestures at the shaking pair inside We see this
from the point of view of the MAN and WOMAN inside the car
CLYDE pulls out a gun makes as if to shoot but he is
kidding They all laugh uproariously especially BUCK who
is delighted with CLYDEs prank All of this we see in
pantomime from inside the trapped car

EXT CAR

CLYDE
Cmon get out Get out of there
I said

They come out hands held high shaking with fear They
have practically turned to jelly

CLYDE
(ordering them into
the other car)
Get in here

INT OTHER CAR DAY

They get in and the gang gets in Seven people are now
jammed inside CLYDE drives BONNIE next to him CW next
to her In back BLANCHE then EUGENE with VELMA (of
necessity) sitting on his lap and then BUCK As will be
seen the reason the Barrows have kidnapped the couple is
simply that they wanted company Living as they do seeing
only each other day after day they long for diversion and
new faces So the atmosphere in the car will shortly change
to one of friendliness and jollity and it will get
progressively more so in the series of cuts which advance
the time As the car starts up at the beginning however
the MAN and WOMAN are terrified

BUCK
Whats your name

EUGENE
(hesitantly)
Im Eugene Grizzard

VELMA
Im Velma Davis

BUCK
(just as friendly as
he can be)
Well howdy Were the Barrow gang
That there is Clyde drivin and Im
Buck

The MAN and WOMAN almost faint from fear clutch at each
other The gang all laugh at this VELMA and EUGENE begin
to realize that they are not going to get hurt and that the
Barrows are friendly to them

BONNIE
Look dont be scared folks It
aint like you was the law Youre
just folks like us

EUGENE
(agreeing over-enthusiastically)
Yeah yeah thats the truth

CLYDE
I expect you been readin about us

The MAN and the WOMAN answer simultaneously with what they
think is the right thing to say under the circumstances

EUGENE
Yes

VELMA
No

They glare at each other
EUGENE
(meaningfully)
Yes Velma we have too

BONNIE
(laughing at the contretemps)

Well you two must be in love I bet

EUGENE and VELMA blush get shy for a second BONNIE smiles

BUCK
(gleefully clapping
his hands)
Well when you gonna marry the

girl boy
Everyone chuckles heartily
CUT TO

INT CAR LATER

--still driving same positions but some time has elapsed
The atmosphere is now completely convivial and the captives
are enjoying their new friends As the scene starts BUCK
is finishing his joke

BONNIE
So then she drinks her milk down
again every drop And she looks

over at her son and says Son
whatever you do dont sell that
cow

The couple laughs with great amusement but everyone else in
the car doesnt laugh--this is the tenth time theyve heard
the joke

cut To
INT OF CAR

--getting on toward evening All are thoroughly relaxes and
chatting

BONNIE
(to Velma)
How old are you honey
VELMA
Thirty-three

A sudden look of surprise registers on EUGENEs face
INT OF CAR NIGHT

It is now night Everyone inside the car is eating
Apparently they stopped somewhere along the way for food

In the crowded interior it is like a party--food is being
passed back and forth laughter and gaiety increasing
warmth between the couple and the Barrows The car has
become a little society on wheels dashing through the black
night down the highway Inside there is a small world of
happiness and fun

BUCK is unpacking the food and passing sandwiches and drinks
around the car

VELMA
Now I ordered some French fries
didnt I

BUCK

(passing her some)
Yeah here you go

CLYDE
Take it easy on those French fries
Velma Aint that right Eugene

EUGENE
(studying his hamburger)
This isnt mine I ordered mine
well done Whos got the other
hamburger

Close-up CW who has already taken a bite of the other one

cW
Oh is this supposed to be yours

He extends the bitten burger out to EUGENE
Full shot

EUGENE
Thats okay forget it
CLYDE laughs at this

BUCK
(chewing)
Haw I sure am havin a good time
How bout you folks Aint you

CLYDE
(laughing)

That idea strikes everyone as being very amusing

EUGENE
(laughing)
Ha Wouldnt they be surprised
back home to hear that

VELMA
Yeah What would Martha and Bill
say if they heard that
(she roars with laughter)
(MORE )

VELMA (CONTD)

EUGENE
Lordy Theyd throw a fit
(roars with laughter)

BONNIE
(laughing)
What do you do anyway

EUGENE
(as his laugh begins
to fade)

Im an undertaker

Suddenly everyone freezes A shudder as if the cold hand
of death had suddenly touched the occupants of the car The
atmosphere changes to cold deadly fearful silence in
exactly one second It is a premonition of death for the
Barrows and they react accordingly BONNIE especially
Close-up BONNIE

BONNIE
(tautly in a flat voice)
Get them out of here

EXT ROAD NIGHT

The car brakes to a sudden stop The rear down is opened
the MAN and WOMAN flung out into the darkness The car
drives off into the lonely night

From this point on the audience should realize that death
is inevitable for the Barrow gang that it follows them
always that it waits anywhere It is no longer a question
of whether death will come but when it will

EXT WOODS MORNING

Moving with CLYDE he tears through the brush snagging his
clothes calling BONNIEs name CLYDEs search is so
desperate here that for a moment we might think he is
fleeing from something rather than looking for something

In a moment he emerges onto the road The car with CW
driving and BUCK and BLANCHE beside him is patrolling
slowly up ahead of him

CLYDE spots it and runs toward it Hold on this angle until
he catches up with it and leaps onto the running board

Moving shot Car Morning CLYDE now on the running
board his head poked into the car his face apple red and
sweating

CLYDE
(breathing heavily)
see anythin Buck

BUCK is shocked at his brothers desperation but makes no
overt comment on it

BUCK
--not yet boy

CLYDE

(with an edge of
paranoia as if the
three of them might

be withholding

something from him)
--and nobody saw her leave or
heard anythin

(almost a threat)

EXT CAR MOVING SHOT DAY

CLYDE gets the point For the very first time we see CLYDe
the leader helpless as he hangs onto the running board

CLYDE
(lamely)
Well where do you think she
couldve goneBuckBuck

BUCK
(amazed and a little frightened)
Jesus I dont know

CLYDE looks helplessly at his brother then drops off the
running board and continues on foot running along scanning
the fields--the car keeping up beside him as he runs and we
truck before both car and CLYDE

Angle on car through windshield Reaction shot Day BUCK
turning to BLANCHE shrugging his shoulders speechless

Reverse angle through the windshield Day--at CLYDE who
has suddenly seen something begins gesticulating wildly
almost--from cars POV a little comically

CLYDE
There There There

He starts running off into a cornfield

Another angle--picking up CLYDE as he kicks his way into the
cornfield knees pumping high knocking down the stalks He
stops and picks up the stocking he had spotted takes it and
moves on

Still another angle as CLYDE has picked up a freshly beaten
trail through the cornfield He picks up one of BONNIEs
scarves now As he runs on he clears a knoll and BONNIE
her yellow hair unmistakable even at this distance comes
into view Shes far off in the cornfield stalking off
looking neither to right nor left carrying a brown paper
sack that has split from which she has occasionally lost
clothing CLYDE screams BONNIE She apparently doesnt
hear

Angle on cornfield Day As CLYDE gets closer BONNIE
herself suddenly breaks into flight the paper bag splitting
completely the remaining clothes spilling out There is a
real chase where they each try to get the advantage CLYDE
is so exhausted from his run that he has real trouble
cornering her as they maneuver up and down the rows of corn
Finally CLYDE catches up

Extreme close-up BONNIE and CLYDE Day As they tumble
into the stalks of corn mowing them down

BONNIE
Leave me alone Leave me alone

CLYDE

(holding her kissing

her frantically)
Heyhey hey baby hey Bonnie
hey baby

(calming her down)
Hey hey nowjust where did
you think you were goin

BONNIE doesnt answer

Up angle POV CLYDE As hes momentarily distracted by
BUCKs laughter as hes in the cornfield picking up BONNIEs
clothing CLYDE waves an impatient its all-right-wave He
turns back to BONNIE who he still holds tightly

CLYDE
(still frantic)
--Huh Bonnie Where Where

BONNIE
I dont know Youre hurting me I
was just scared is alland my
mamas been on my mind and shes
gettin so old

BONNIE hesitates beginning to feel a little foolish now
CLYDE

Boy dont ever leave without
sayin somethin You really

BONNIE
But I mean it though I want to
see my mama Please Clyde

Two shot BONNIE and CLYDE Day

kissing her)

EXT SIDE OF A ROAD VERY LONG SHOT DAY

--of three or four cars parked on the side of a road in
Texas A light rain is falling There are a lot of people
gathered around but the sound is an indistinct mixture of
talk laughter etc

There follows a quick montage of cuts which isolate specific
moments in the family reunion thereby implying the entire
tone of the proceedings The sense of family pervades

Montage BONNIE and MOTHER BONNIEs mother an old woman
grabs her and hugs her and cries

Montage BONNIE CLYDE MAN A man an uncle perhaps
stands with BONNIE and CLYDE arms around them both hugging
them to his sides tightly

Montage BONNIE and sister BONNIEs sister hands them a
scrapbook of clippings

SISTER
Here you are we been cuttin and
pastin everything we could find
about you in the papers

CLYDE BONNIE BUCK and BLANCHE all look at the scrapbook
We see a page of it showing newspaper articles with the
photographs the gang took back at the motel

BUCK
Hey look heres that one I took of
you Clyde That came out just fine
Montage BONNIE CLYDE MAN BONNIE and CLYDE are posing
for a comic snapshot A silly looking male relative is
posing pointing a gun at them They have their hands in
the air and are grinning broadly (The effect should be
funny and simultaneously frightening)

Montage BUCK SMALL BOY BUCK is sitting with a little
four-year-old on his knee bouncing him up and down and
singing Both are having a fine time

BUCK
(singing)
Oh Horsey keep your tail up keep
yer tail up keep yer tail up Oh
Horsey keep yer tail up Why dont
you make it rise

Montage--CW A hand off camera thrusts a sandwich at CW
He opens the bread to see whats inside it then eats it

Montage--BONNIE and SISTER BONNIE sits stock-still while her
sister gives her a permanent in the back seat of a car He
sister pauses setting down the curling iron She strokes
BONNIEs yellow head with her hand as though she were a
wild animal that had paused long enough to be petted

BONNIE turns to see her sisters expression They embrace

Montage--Family picnic--Favoring CLYDE MOTHER and BONNIE
CLYDE in his best theatrical manner has been playing host
in the sand pile perhaps using some sort of towel across
the arm or around the middle The party is beginning to
break up now as used paper plates and crumpled napkins are
blowing across the sand and the group is finishing up on
Eskimo pie

BONNIES UNCLE
(rising)

CLYDE
(right back)
I dont know what yall got in

her MOTHER who having been hefted to her feet by BONNIEs
sister has turned to CLYDE who gives her a big boyish hug

MOTHER

BONNIE
(to Clyde)

CLYDE

(ignoring Bonnie as

does Mother

ebulliently even joshing)
Now Mrs Parker dont yall

Thats the law talking there They
want us to look big sos theyll
look big when they catch us

He knows hes stumbled onto the wrong thing but he bounces
right along--its his style

CLYDE
--and they cant do that Why Im

the stuff they said we did wed be
millionaires wouldnt we old

(MORE )

CLYDE (CONTD)

(he turns to Bonnie

who continues to

stare at her Mother)
And I wouldnt risk Bonnie here
just to make money uncertain as
times are Why one time I knowed
of a job where we could of make
2000 easy but I saw the law
outside and I said to myself why
Bonnie could get hurt here Sol
just drove right on and let that
money lay

He waits for a response as does BONNIE BONNIEs MOTHER
smiles a little abstractedly

MOTHER
-Maybe you know the way with her
then Im just an old woman and I
dont know nothin

She trails off looking nowhere in particular CLYDE takes
her reaction to mean that hes overwhelming her with his
confidence and continues to pour it on

CLYDE
Well be quittin this just as soon
as the hard times is over Mother
Parker I can tell you that Why
me and Bonnie were just talkin the
other day and we talked about when
wed settle down and get us a home
and Bonnie said I couldnt bear
to live mornn three miles from my
precious mother Now howd you
like that Mother Parker

BONNIEs MOTHER has undergone a funny sort of transformation
during CLYDEs speech--as if something had suddenly come
into focus before the old womans eyes

MOTHER

Dont believe I would I surely
dont

(to Bonnie)
You try to live three miles from me
and you wont live long honey

(to Clyde)
Youd best keep runnin and you
know it Clyde Barrow
(matter of fact)

She hugs BONNIE who can barely respond We move in fora

come by to squeeze kiss and hug her with a chirpy little
chorus of Bye Bonnie Bye Bonnie bye bye bye

identical garages an entirely symmetrical structure

nails in a corner of the room The odds are CLYDE on a

in the only stuffed chair in the room Their os
raucousness is clearly shattering to BONNIE who at a key
moment in the scene ends up spearing her cuticle with a
file spurting a little board and a lot of temper

Other angle CLYDE--BUCK--BLANCHE--CW Day A naked
lightbulb (the lampshade has been removed) glares down on
CWs chest--where a pair of bluebirds have been tattooed
with a rocco flourish BUCK and BLANCHE are vastly amused--

animal submitting to inspection)

She picks up the first three objects she can find on the
dresser and hurls them--an ashtray a Gideon Bible anda
flower pot--at the little group The pot goes shattering
into the wall Everyone ducks

I hate you all

CLYDE

BONNIE

She turns away from him wilts onto the bed

BONNIE
(eyes brimming)
Oh baby Ive got the blues so
bad

CLYDE moves behind her begins to massage her back There
is something very delicate about the way he touches her it
suggests CLYDEs sensitivity to her mood rather than any
degree of physical intimacy

CLYDE
Bonnieis it your mama what
your mama said

BONNIE
What mamashes just an old
woman nowI have no mama

BONNIE rolls over on her back stares up at CLYDE tears
splaying across her face from the move

BONNIE
(quietly)
So funnyI thought when we
first went out we were really
goin somewherebut this is it--
were just goin huh

She has addressed this last directly to CLYDE but there is
nothing rhetorical about it--it is a real question CLYDE
doesnt answer for a moment Then

CLYDE
Do you care about where were goin

BONNIE clearly finds this hard to say

BONNIE
Not as long as you care about me

CLYDE
(quite simply)
Why I love you sugar

Its the first time hes said it to her and BONNIE is
overwhelmed She wraps her arms around CLYDEs middle and
snuggles into him like a child Neither we nor CLYDE can
see BONNIEs face now and her voice is muffled by his chest

INT PLATTE CITY MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

On CWs moonlit chest and face tattooed bluebirds heaving
and occasionally snoring in the night Behind him the room
is dimly lit by flickering candles that are placed out of
sight on the floor The shapes in the room--the bed is
gutted and only the box mattress remains--dresser lamp
shades etc are grotesque in the flickering light Os
sounds of BONNIE and CLYDE BONNIE giggling and CLYDE
whispering something we cant quite hear

Move across the room toward the gutted bed Move giggling
from the floor beneath the box mattress--for a moment it
should appear as if something perversely sexual may be going
on between BONNIE and CLYDE

BONNIES VOICE
Ready

CLYDES VOICE
(a little embarrassed)
Aw Bonnie--

BONNIES VOICE
(coaxing)
Cmon

CLYDEs arm wielding a Tommy gun clears the bed With the
muzzle CLYDE knocks the swivel mirror on the dresser
overhead bringing BONNIE and CLYDE into view

Closer angle mirror--BONNIE and CLYDE Night BONNIE lies
stiff as a statue on the white mattress impeccably dressed
for her funeral Candelabras made of empty beer bottles lie
at her head and feet BONNIEs hands and face are powdered
and painted a waxen white She wears a garish silk bow in
her hair which it for this occasion curled like a little
girls

CLYDE sits up beer bottle in one hand Tommy gun in the
other derby hat cocked--and just a little unsure of the
whole thing He takes a swig--BONNIE stops him trying
terribly hard not to change her position

BONNIE
Lie down now honey

CLYDE
Ive done enough

Angle on mirror--BONNIE and CLYDE Night

BONNIE
(with patience to a child)
You have to lie downits the
only way we can tell what well
look kike together

She giggles again more than a little gassed herself CLYDE

clamps a big cigar between his teeth and abruptly lies down
beside her CLYDE is both amused and annoyed

CLYDE
(staring up at
himself talking with
cigar clenched
between his teeth)
Whatta you think

BONNIE
(it suddenly strikes her)
Thats not the right tie

CLYDE
What

BONNIE
(rising weaving a little)
You cant wear polka-dots on an
occasion like this

CLYDE
Well what--

BONNIE
Stripes Dont go away now

She weaves her way over to the dresser takes a swig from a
bottle there herself checks her makeup and returns with
the tie Holding against his chest to try it out she almost
falls into him CLYDE steadies her

BONNIE
Perfect

She tries to tie it for him and clearly has trouble with
the knot

CLYDE
OK ok If were gonna do this
at least I can tie it myself Lie
down before you fall down

INT MOTEL BEDROOM--BONNIE AND CLYDE NIGHT

She does with some play-acting exaggerated obeisance to
CLYDEs command--reaching up at the last moment like a
zombie and snatching an artificial flower from BLANCHEs hat
which still lies on the dresser CLYDE lies down now They
look into the mirror again

CLYDE
(grudgingly)
Better
BONNIE
Much

This tickles CLYDE despite himself and he laughs--BONNIE
begins to sing to him--performing for both CLYDe and her own
image in the mirror--like some hoydenish vaudevillian

During the course of the song she will rise and take CLYDE
with her who finally joins in when they tip-toe over and
begin to serenade CW

BONNIE and CLYDE
(to the lugubrious
strains of the Death March)
Did you ever think when a hearse
went by
That somebody you or I may die
Theyll wrap you up in a big white
sheet

and bury you down just about six
feet

The worms crawl in the worms crawl
out

The worms play penuckle on your
snout

Your eyes fall in your teeth fall
out

Your face turns green and the pus
runs out

During this last they have been hovering over CWs
twitching face like a couple of tipsy ghouls whisper-
singing into his ears CW finally blinks doesnt even
bother to look at them

cW
Im gonna die if I dont get some
sleep Quit singing that

Reaction--BONNIE and CLYDE Night They smile go back and

lie down Looking at their images

BONNIE
All right shut your eyes now

CLYDE
(playing along with her)
No you first

BONNIE
One for the money

CLYDE

As they approach four we should feel that somehow when they
shut their eyes they really will die They shut them on
GO and screen goes black

EXT PLATTE CITY MOTEL NIGHT

Ranged across the lawn are six police cars loaded with
peace officers Four men come out and guns drawn walk
cautiously over to the room on the right--BUCK and BLANCHEs

INT PLATTE CITY MOTEL BUCKS CABIN NIGHT

There is a knock on the door They sit bolt upright in bed
Before BUCK can say anything BLANCHE puts her hand over his
mouth to shut him up

BLANCHE
(calling out)
The men are on the other side

EXT PLATTE CITY MOTEL NIGHT

The four lawmen among them the DEPUTY from the cafe edge
their way across the lawn past the first garage past the
second Before they reach the door of BONNIE and CLYDEs
cabin the window smashes and there are blasts of gunfire
One cop is hit and falls the others run back to the cars
for cover BONNIE and CW are at the window firing
steadily

CLYDE--running into the garage to get the car They must
escape All they can do is escape and all they have is
that one car in the closed garage

Outside Two of the lawmen fall to the ground shot As

the remaining two run back for cover we see a blinding

light rolling up in a space between the six cars It is an
armored truck with mounted guns and and spotlight advancing
toward the cabin

Inside the armored truck Two men in the seat Sounds of
gunshots coming from everywhere piercing light From
inside the truck we suddenly see the windshield shattered
from bullets fired by BONNIE and CW The driver is hit

and he slumps over the wheel His body hits the horn which
starts blasting and continues throughout the battle The
other man quickly ducks under the dashboard for protection

Inside the garage CLYDE standing by the car He holds the
Browning Automatic The garage door is shaking from the
impact of bullets shattering His gun already firing
(automatic clip) before he gets there CLYDE in a crouch
runs to the garage door flings it up and runs back inside
the car Now the door is open and he can get the car out

One hand on the wheel one hand shooting he rolls the car
out onto the driveway The battle is raging from all sides

EXT STREET

The car stops CLYDE keeps shooting The door of the cabin
flies open and BONNIE and CW come charging out guns
blazing away CW fires the Thompson sub-machine gun
BONNIE fires two pistols with automatic clips They run in
a crouch tryingto get inside the car in front of their door
They make it

Camera pans across the motel to the other door It opens
BUCK and BLANCHE come out holding a double bed mattress in
front of them for protection This makes their running
awkward--the mattress is heavy BLANCHE carries the front
end BUCK the back with one hand the other firing his gun
They get halfway to the car and then BUCK is hit shot in
the head He falls to the ground BLANCHE and the mattress
fall too since she has lost balance Both are under the
mattress

CLYDE dashes out of the car and drags BUCK into the back
seat BLANCHE follows hysterical All guns on all sides
are still firing They fling themselves into the car and
from a standing start the car starts out at 60 mph down the
driveway One of the lawmen stands blocking the way with a
double-barrele rifle but the car keeps coming about to run
him down He jumps out of the way and fires at the side
The glass cracks and we see BLANCHE fling a hand to her
face which is bloody A piece of glass has lodged in her
eye We hear her scream The horn is still blasting

INT THE CAR SWERVING MADLY
CLYDE manages to keep it on the road They drive away
EXT STREET

The police run back to their cars to give chase calling out
to each other unable to believe that the gang could possibly
have gotten away

INT CAR NIGHT

as it is speeding down the highway Crazy mad hillbilly
music on the soundtrack Packed inside this car right now

is more sheer human misery and horror than could be believed
It is hell in there hell and suffering and pain The car

is a complete mess CW is sobbing Everyone is hysterical
BLANCHE is shrieking with pain and concern for BUCK BUCK

is alternating between groaning and passing out completely
BONNIE is yelling at everybody to shut up

Only CLYDE driving with both hands clenched on the wheel
is silent The car is doing 90

EXT SUBURBAN STREET NIGHT

The car from the outside a half hour later They have
eluded the police They are barreling down the road at top
speed on a nice suburban street with proper homes It is
the middle of the night utter silence CLYDE stops the
car points to ca car in a driveway--it is a beautiful
shiny new and expensive automobile CW runs out runs up
the driveway peers inside gets in quietly backs it down
the driveway and pulls behind the gangs bullet-riddled
getaway car Suddenly they both zoom off down the road
together

INT OF THE NEW CAR NIGHT

CW driving alone He is crying mumbling wiping his eyes
and nose with one hand while he controls the wheel with the
other

EXT RING OF FIRS NIGHT

A wide field in the country This is Dexter Iowa It is
quiet We see in a long shot that takes in everything
that this is a meadow surrounded by a ring of trees a dense
forest that circles them The meadow however is large

The two cars drive into the middle of the field headlights
on They stop and the Barrow gang gets out They are in
horrible shape--we can finally have a look at them Half-
dressed in their pajamas bloody dirty in tatters Those
that can stagger out do so others are carried A far shot
of all this

Closer shot Moving closer to them we see CLYDE and CW
lay BUCK down on the ground CLYDE begins to administer to
his wounds as best he can mostly just wiping him off BUCK
is semi-conscious All are in a semi-daze BLANCHE falls
to her knees still clutching her eyes She is totally
hysterical

BLANCHE
Oh God please help us Dear
Father in Heaven get us out of
this and Buck will never do another
bad thing in his life
(she continues
moaning praying sobbing)

BONNIE walks over to the group looking at BUCK CW goes
over to her Two shot--BONNIE and CW

cW
He aint got a chance Half his
head blown off

Camera pulls back to take in BLANCHE

BLANCHE
My eyes
(she SCREAMS)
God I think Im blind
(in the headlights)
light hurts so bad

BONNIE walks over to the car and comes back with the
sunglasses BUCK had given BLANCHE Moving her out of the
glare she helps BLANCHE put them on BONNIE now has an arm
around BLANCHE and BLANCHE shivers into BONNIE gracefully
BONNIE is a little repelled by BLANCHE but comforts her out
of genuine feeling for her

BLANCHE
(clinging)
Please please get us to a doctor
Tell Clyde to get us to a doctor
Well die here

BONNIE
(helping with glasses)
--here hon

BONNIE looks silently up to CLYDE CLYDE is looking dumbly
down at his mangled brother

BLANCHE
(going on)
Clyde Clyde please get us to a
doctor

Though BLANCHE cannot see it CLYDE has knelt down to the
side of BUCK taking BUCKs hand and with his other hand has
begun smoothing BUCKs hair back away from the wound
BLANCHE
Hes your brother

BONNIE
(gently knowing
CLYDE will not and
cannot answer BLANCHE)
Buck cant be moved now hon

BLANCHEs answer to this is hysterical sobbing burying
herself into BONNIE mumbling half-coherent muffled prayers
between the sobs

With BUCK and CLYDE

BUCK
(weakly)
ClydeClyde

CLYDE
Right here boy

BUCK
I believe I lost my shoesmaybe
the dog hid em
(he lapses into
unconsciousness again)

CLYDE has begun to cry a little continues to smooth back
BUCKs hair with ritualistic regularity

Wide angle Night Camera pulls away way back to wide
shot of the entire field showing the group in the center of
the darkness lit by the headlights

Match dissolve into early dawn camera still on the wide
shot The field is lighter though the trees still loom
blackly around it The two cars one almost a shattered
wreck the other bright and shiny and new are parked in the
center The sky is light but the trees cast a dark shadow
on the field The gang is just sitting around BLANCHE
weeping next to BUCK CW sitting on the running board of a
car staring BONNIE standing and smoking CLYDE still
with BUCK

All is quiet
EXT WOODS DAY

From the edge of the woods a man in a white shirt emerges
from behind a tree The camera swings abruptly to get him
He calls out to the gang

MAN
Surrender

It is a total surprise BONNIE CLYDE and CW all grab
their guns and fire several shots they are not firing the
big guns now but the pistols The man lingers there for a
moment--he looks strange white luminous like an
apparition--and then he vanishes into the woods Silence
long enough to make you think it was perhaps an illusion

Then there is a volley of gunfire--a noise so large as to be
almost an impossible sound--coming from the woods all
around everywhere

A ring of little white puffs of smoke emerge from the woods
from every tree a puff of smoke The camera pans ina
circle Behind every tree is a man with a gun There are
at least 150 people out there--peace officers farmers with
hunting rifles kids with squirrel guns everyone who wanted
to come along and catch BONNIE and CLYDE Their number is
so large because this time they want no possibility of the
gang making what seemed by them supernatural escapes

From this point on the sound of guns is unnaturally muffled
on the sound track We hardly hear them at allit is like
a dream

Without a word all of the gang including the half-dead BUCK
making his final effort scramble for the nearest car They
run throughout this battle crouched like animals--their
only thought to get away to escape To fight it out would
be ludicrous

From the moment the Barrows start in motion there is
shooting again from the edge of the woods We see them
scrambling towards the car in an extreme long shot
surrounded by the ring of smoke

CUT TO
INT OF THE CAR

All of them inside CLYDE is at the wheel
cut To
EXT CAR

Med Long shot of the car moving The sound track goes to
complete silence We see the car looking for an avenue of
escape It veers towards a tree a man steps out from
behind the tree and fires the car jerks and veers toward
another tree again a man steps out and fires and so on
The car performs its eccentric dance all in utter silence
(no sound of the motor nothing) The film should have the
feeling of slow motion as the car swerves and loops along
the edge of the woods Not once do any of the Barrows fire
back Another man steps out and aims

INT CAR

Close-up CLYDE At the wheel-shot in the arm He grabs
his arm in pain loses control of the wheel

EXT CAR

--out of control (still silent) It smashes into a tree
stump The picture stops freezes for three beats We hold
the image of the moment of crash with pieces of metal
crumpling and flying into the air suspended there by the
stop-film

cut To
INT CAR

Sound partly up again but never at its realistic volume
From inside the smashed car we peer out the window across
the field and see the other car The thought strikes the
audience at the same time it strikes the gang--they must get
to that car

Med shot of the second car sitting in the field shining
in the sun The lawmen also realize what must be done--cut
off this escape Though BONNIE CLYDE and the others are
heading toward it they suddenly train all their fire on the
car rather than the gang

The car fills the frame of the screen Bullets begin to hit
it It starts to quiver under the impact For the next
minute we see the car die in front of our eyes We see the
beautiful machine fall to pieces--windows smash tires torn
apart body riddled The death of the car is as painful to
watch as the willful death of a human being The execution
is paced deliberately to show the ritualistic tempo of the
destruction

EXT WOODS

The camera pulls back way back and slightly above everything
to reveal the entire field On the left of the screen
BONNIE CLYDE and CW are scrambling toward the edge of the
woods In the center BUCK and BLANCHE have taken cover
behind a fallen log In the foreground police begin to
emerge from the woods The camera zooms rapidly in with

them toward BUCK BLANCHE is screaming

BLANCHE
Dont kill him Dont kill him
Hes dying

BUCK is making a last feeble attempt The zoom continues
past BUCK until it comes tight on his hand a lawmans foot
steps on his hand BUCK falls over He dies BLANCHE
screams

BLANCHE
Dont die Daddy Dont die

She goes berserk Five men one hardly a teen-ager grab
her and hold her as she writhes and cries She is still
wearing the sunglasses

CUT TO
EXT WOODS AND STREAM BONNIE CLYDE AND CW DAY

They have reached the edge of the woods Camera tracks with
them as they run From all around come the sounds of the
posse The three get in through the pines and come finally
to a deep stream They jump in and start across running
awkwardly in chest-deep water They are half way across
when the police appear on the bank behind them shooting

Close-up BONNIE Day--as she is struggling through the
water A bullet hits her in the shoulder We must see this
bullet clearly we must see it go in her flesh so that we
can feel it
Tight close-up of BONNIEs face as she screams It is the
first time she has been hurt and the scream is pure animal
pain She cries out

EXT STREAM AND CORNFIELD DAY

CLYDE who has almost reached the other side comes back and
gets her He drags her out of the water and into a cornfield
that starts growing on the opposite bank CW helping He
half-carries half-runs with her into the cornfield as the
field gets deeper and thicker

They stop for a second

CLYDE
(panting to Bonnie)
Sawsaw a farmup aheadgotta
geta Car

He starts to give over the wounded BONNIE to CW

BONNIE
Baby no

But CLYDE has not heard this last Working on pure
adrenaline now he struggles onward Camera tilts up
slightly so we can see CLYDE as he essays his way toward a
farmhouse with a car in the distance After a few moments
he disappears and we can hear only the cracking of the
stalks as that sound too diminishes

Full shot Cornfield Day Silence

Close CW and BONNIE Obviously some time later They
both lie prostrate in the field listening CW licks his
lips

cW
Maybe--

BONNIE
Shhh

They wait for another long moment picking up only the
tiniest sounds

BONNIE
(finally)
Oh no
cW
(nervously)
What What

BONNIE
(as though it were
the most logical
thing in the world)
I cant die without Clyde I just
cant

CW looks at her as if shes gone crazy After another
moment the corn begins to tremble and we hear the os
sound of an approaching car

With CW Day--tentatively lifting his head up to clear the
corn stalks With him we see the car looming larger

bearing down on us splitting the corn stalks The car
finally comes to a stop a few feet in front of CW BONNIE
is on her feet and CLYDE tumbles out of the car practically
before its stopped sweeping BONNIE into him For a moment
both are in their knees a few feet from the running board of
the car simply holding onto each other and not moving

cW
(tugging at both of
them frantically)
Cmon Cmon Cmon
ABRUPT CUT
INT CAR ABOUT A HALF HOUR LATER DAY

They have gotten away but are still escaping CW is
driving He is bare-chested CLYDE is beside him in front
his arm bleeding He falls in and out of consciousness
BONNIE is stretched out in back

Her shoulder has been bandaged with CWs shirt She is
unconscious

INT CAR LATE DAY
CLYDE comes half-awake and looks over at CW

CLYDE
Head out CW
cW
(determinedly)
Im goin home to my daddys farm

DISSOLVE TO
EXT ROAD WITH CAMPSITE THE SAME EVENING

CW is driving down the road hell for leather Nearing a
campsite where there are about six Okie cars and pick-up
trucks all loaded down with a number of poor families
seated around a campfire cooking CW jams on the brakes
He gets out looking totally exhausted

Reaction shot The faces of the Okies looking at this
sudden presence in their midst

Back to CW

cCW
(about to drop)
Can yall spare me a little water

EXT CAMPSITE FULL SHOT

One man the leader of the group dips a cup of water and
approaches CW suspiciously He comes close enough to make
CW reach out for the water but withholds it from him

MAN
Who are you boy

cW
Names Moss

This seems to be enough for the man who gives him the water
As CW gulps it down the man begins to circle the car
peering into it suspiciously Suddenly he starts and his
eyes open wide

MAN
(in really hushed and
reverent tones)
Its Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow

He stands there struck dumb staring Those of the others

who have heard him begin to come over Without a word they
move quietly to the car and stare in
INT CAR

BONNIE is out in the back seat CLYDE is semi-conscious in
the front seat He looks up through half-closed eyes

EXT CAR

We see a woman pour a bowl of soup at the campfire and bring
it to CW He accepts it

A man rolls a cigarette and lights it Then very gingerly
as if afraid to really touch him he reaches through the
window and places it in CLYDEs lips It hangs there CLYDE
unable to drag on it or remove it

Children peer through the back window

CW finishes his cup of soup He hands it and the cup of
water back to a woman in the crowd

Quietly moving together the Okies step back CW walks
to the drivers seat gets in and shuts the door He starts
up the car

The people push a bit closer for a last look CLYDE unable
to do more nods his head in a barely perceptive gesture by
way of saying thank you t ot the people The cigarette is
still dangling from his lips

The car moves off A YOUNG BOY pulls on his FATHERs shirt

BOY
Who was they Pa

MAN
That was Bonnie and Clyde the bank
robbers

A woman nearby smiles sweetly
DISSOLVE TO
EXT MOSS FARM MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

The car pulls up outside the slightly ramshackle farm of
MALCOLM MOSS CWs father in Arcadia Louisiana It
sits for a moment in the dark Then CW honks the horn
A few seconds pass and the porch light comes on OLD MAN
MOSS comes out in his pajamas and peers into the darkness
He is a fat man with gray hair

MALCOLM
Whos there

cW
(calling back)
Daddy

MALCOLM
Whos there Who is it

cW
Its CW Its Clarence

MALCOLM
Clarence

He runs down the steps down the path to his son They
greet each other hugging for a second looking each other
over

MALCOLM
God its good to see you boy

He holds CW at arms length to study him and suddenly he
scowls at something he sees by the light of the porch

MALCOLM
Whats that on your chest

cW

(puzzled)
Huh

(realizing what he means)
Its a tattooIm in trouble
Ill tell you about it later My
friends are hurt Help me get em

MALCOLM goes to car and looks inside for a moment He walks
back to CW

MALCOLM
Jesus what happened to them You

cCW
Yeah Thats Clyde Barrow and
Bonnie Parker
(reaction from Malcolm)
We been shot Help me get em
inside We gotta help em

They go to the car and drag the unconscious BONNIE out and
begin carrying her up to the house

MALCOLM
Whyd you get yourself marked up
A tattoo What in hell made you do
a damn fool thing like that

They reach the house

cW
Cmon Pa open the door

INT SHERIFFS OFFICE IN DEXTER DAY

Although the scene begins with a full-screen close-up of a
newspaper clipping with a photo it is just a blurry-gray
crowded scene of BLANCHEs capture Really impossible to
make anybody out in the crowd Camera stays on photo as we
hear voice over of two men talking a sheriff and his deputy

BILLY
I was in the bunch that took er
See here Can you make me out
Here I am see here right behind
Joe Boyd here

PETE
Sure enough Billy is that your
head there

Camera pulls away BILLY a young deputy--cold intense
humorless and square carefully folds up the clipping and
puts it in his wallet

BILLY
Still cant figure how we let them
other two get away

PETE
(an older more
genial type)
Yeah seems as how nobody can get
em somehow

BILLY
(sullen)
Yeahwell maybe this boyll be
the one to do it this Hamer guy
Boy if he cant do it Sheriff
aint nobody but the whole US
Army can do it

PETE

(with a new note of

enthusiasm gets up

and walks to the

window--turning to Billy)
You hear he quit the Rangers on
account of Texas got that woman
governor Said he wouldnt work
under no woman

BILLY
(respectfully)
Yeah thats somethin all right
Say how many they say he shot
anyway in his day

PETE
Sixty-five they say

BILLY
Son of a sea-cook

The door opens We see full shot and then fast close-up
FRANK HAMER It should be a complete shock to the audience--
this is the man kidnapped by the gang earlier and partially
destroyed by BONNIE

HAMER is dressed in his Ranger outfit and hat and again he
has that quality of sinister frenzy beneath his calm manner
His attitude toward these lawmen is sheer condescension
friendly only out of convention really superior and
contemptuous of lesser workers in his field

HAMER
(with politeness
arising from condescension)
Excuse me am I in the right place
Is this Sheriff Smoot

PETE and BILLY jump up from the chairs and walk over to
HAMER hands extended They are quite impressed by meeting
in the flesh
PETE
(mispronouncing his name)
Frank Hammer I sure am pleased to
meet you
(shakes his hand)

HAMER

EXT MOSS FARM CLOSE SHOT NEWSPAPER DAY

A coil of rope snaps into and through the paper splitting
it and revealing CWs startled face CLYDE strides the
porch angrily snapping the rope

BONNIE and MALCOLM are seated along with CW Through

BONNIE has her arm supported by a sling and CLYDE has his
shoulder bandagedm it is evident by CLYDEs heady indignation
and BONNIEs attentiveness that both are well on the way to
recovery

CLYDE

(still snapping rope)
FLED What do they mean fled
How in the nama God could I leave
my brother to die when he was
already dead when I left him
(livid)
He was shot in too many pieces to
pick off the ground Fledwhat
do they know the papers or the
police

Suddenly he moves upon MALCOLM with enormous intent as if
by pounding the point home to the one relative stranger
among them he will justify it all MALCOLM momentarily
flinches then listens with intense deference

CLYDE
Why while we were all lyin around
here near dead they had us
holdin up the Grand Prairie
National Bank They hung that one
on us just for luck guess

CLYDE shakes his head still thinking this over Abruptly
to BONNIE with deadly seriousness
CLYDE
Tell you what Soons we get well
were gonna take that bank

He breaks into a wicked grin but then reels catching
himself on the porch railing Hes obviously dizzy from
exertion and anger BONNIE starts--then sees CLYDE is in
control

CLYDE
(remarking on his own dizziness)
Whoooococo0o boy
(kneeling to Bonnie)

on CW displaying an entirely different demeanor from the

one he presented outside

MALCOLM

which flutters
through CWs open shirt)

INT HOSPITAL MED SHOT OF THE ROOM

Seated in a soft chair looking directly at us is BLANCHE
BARROW Her eyes are completely covered with a white
bandage She wears a hospital gown The room is white and
bright

Med shot HAMER in the doorway The nurse leaves He
reaches in his pocket and pulls out a white handkerchief
He puts it over his mouth to disguise his voice afraid she
will remember it from the kidnap Quietly almost on
tiptoes HAMER walks over to BLANCHE He gets inches away
from her face She still doesnt know he is there

HAMER
(quietly but
suddenly his voice
muffled by the handkerchief)
Blanche Barrow

She starts to her feet then adjusts to his presence She
is a bit panicked BLANCHE is now a defeated human being
Her voice and manner bespeak great weariness sorrow and
still a touch of her old high-strung hysteria But most of
that is gone now like everything else that was really vital
in her life

BLANCHE
What What Who is it

HAMER
(in a monotone a
relentless questioner)
You know your husbands dead

BLANCHE

warming up to the

to talk and talk for

the sake of airing

her troubles)

creep into her voice

as she relives it all)

FADE OUT

FADE IN
EXT CAR ON THE MOSS FARM A DIRT PATH NEAR THE BARN DAY

It is pouring rain middle of the afternoon BONNIE and
CLYDE are inside the car sitting They have lived so much
in cars that they tend to still spend much of their time in
it rather than in a room There they are themselves

INT CAR

BONNIE is in the back seat her legs wrapped in a plaid
blanket writing poetry She looks like Elizabeth Barrett
Browning With one essential difference--her arm is ina
sling and she is wearing bandages on the shoulder CLYDE is
in the front seat reading a newspaper He is also partially
bandaged On the dashboard is a box of ginger-snaps which

he eats while he reads They look domestic

CLYDE
Want a ginger-snap Bonnie

BONNIE

(busy absorbed)
No hum-umm

(then she realizes

his nice gesture and

smiles warmly at him)
But thanks anyway Clyde

(she takes it all in

her situation and

looks content and cozy)
Its real nice here just the two
of us like this

CLYDE
(more interested in

his paper)
Uh-huh

(something in the

paper catches his interest)
Look here honey remember this

He holds up the paper there is one of the photos from the
motel the one showing BONNIE smoking She looks up at it
with mild interest

BONNIE
Yeah at the motel

CLYDE
(studying the picture)
You sure dont resemble that no more

Close-up BONNIE She doesnt She has become totally
fragile the essence of herself She is writing on a pad

CLYDE and BONNIE

CLYDE
What you writin this time

BONNIE
(intensely)
Im writing a poem about us Im
writing our story

CLYDE
(this appeals to his ego)
Oh are you Lets hear it If
its good Ill mail it in to the
Law and itll be printed in all the
papers again

BONNIE
Just let me finish this line

She does so CLYDE munches a cookie

BONNIE
(continuing)
Okay here it is

Close-up BONNIE--as she reads intensely At the beginning
of this montage the camera remains on her face Behind her
we see the rain on the window

BONNIE
(reading)
The Story of Bonnie and Clyde

Youve heard the story of Jesse
James-—

Of how he lived and died

If youre still in need

Of something to read

Heres the story of Bonnie and
Clyde

Now Bonnie and Clyde are the Barrow
Gang

Im sure you all have read

How they rob and steal

And those who squeal

Are usually found dying or dead

They call them cold-hearted killers
They say they are heartless and
mean

But I say this with pride

That I once knew Clyde

When he was honest and upright and
clean

But the laws fooled around
Kept taking him down

And locking him in a cell
Till he said to me

Ill never be free

So Ill meet a few of them in
hell

The road was so dimly lighted

There were no highway signs to

guide

But they made up their minds

If all roads were blind

They wouldnt give up till they died
CUT TO

INT POLICE STATION DAY

The manuscript is lying on the police blotter HAMER picks
it up and continues reading it

Close-up of a newspaper page
way down the length of one column

HAMER
The road gets dimmer and dimmer
Sometimes you can hardly see
But its fight man to man
And do all you can
For they know they can never be
free

From heartbreak some people have
suffered

From weariness some people have
died

But take it all in all

Our troubles are small

Till we get like Bonnie and Clyde

BONNIEs voice picks up the recitation

INT CAR

The day is sunny and we see it through the car window

continues reading but now she reads it directly from

newspaper

BONNIES VOICE (0S)

If a policeman is killed in Dallas

And they have no clue or guide
If they cant find a fiend

They just wipe their slate clean
And hang it on Bonnie and Clyde

CLOSE-UP OF BONNIE DAY

BONNIE
f they try to act like citizens
And rent them a nice little flat
About the third night
Theyre invited to fight
By a sub-guns rat-tat-tat

Some day theyll go down together
Theyll bury them side by side

To few itll be grief--

o the law a relief--

show that it is a different day different clothes and the
bandages are gone As she stops she has an expectant and
somewhat self-satisfied look

Close-up of CLYDE His eyes are wide his mouth open his
face shows surprise and delight and he is on the verge of a
giant laugh

CLYDE
(in gleeful wonder)
Damn Thats me

A great laugh comes bursting from him Camera widens to
take in BONNIE She is both startled and delighted by his
response

CLYDE
(continuing)
In that poem

all starting to come

realization that he
has made it that he

legend that he is an
important figure)

He kisses her She kisses back They are chuckling
giggling They grow more ardent they pull back and laugh
again They begin to make love

EXT ARCADIA STREET ICE CREAM PARLOR DAY

Bright afternoon Camera across the street from an ice
cream parlor Sign about it EVAS HAND-PACKED ICE CREAM
A large plate glass window fronts the store and through it
we can see the people inside seated at tables and booths
Prominent in our vision is MALCOLM MOSS seated facing
camera He is seated across from another man but we see
him from the back

MALCOLM is obviously doing a lot of talking and then some
hard listening gesticulating and looking disturbed After
a bit of this he rises from the table and begins walking
toward the door The other man rises and turns We now see
that it is FRANK HAMER

MALCOLM and HAMER come out onto the sidewalk squinting in
the sunlight MALCOLM mimes some social pleasantries by way
of saying goodbye but HAMERs face shows no emotion of
recognition of the gesture He turns and walks away
walking out of the frame

MALCOLM stands where he is in front of the ice cream parlor
By the expression on his face we can see that he is rather
disturbed by what he has heard and that he is still grappling
with the problem

DISSOLVE TO

BONNIE and CLYDE They lie where they were with one
difference--they are now wrapped in the blanket CLYDEs
pants are wadded up and tangled with his shoes at the base
of the blanket

CLYDE
(chuckling apparently
quite pleased)
Damndamndamn

He casts a sidelong glance to BONNIE wanting some sort of
overt reaction from her Shes just smiling slightly
CLYDEs underlying anxiety begins to surface

CLYDE
(not looking at her)
Hey listen Bonnie how do you feel

BONNIE
(watching him
steadily her slight
smile growing)
Fine
CLYDE

I mean you feel like youre sposed
to feel after youve uh

CLYDE
(doesnt know what
the fuck to say
desperately wants her approval)

Reason I ask is I uh Well I
figger its a good idea to ask I

the way

Hey

CLYDE looks at her for the first time

BONNIE
(stopping him with
great warmth)

You done just perfect

He can see she means it Now his buoyancy utterly

unchained breaks

through

CLYDE

I did didnt I I mean I did I
really did I did it I did I

mean

this was my first time and it

was just like rollin off a log

when

it comes right down to it it

was easy I mean I didnt even have
to try

Lovingly laughing altogether overwhelmed with himself
CLYDE pulls BONNIE into him He kisses her wants to make
love again but then pulls back and keeps chattering at
sixty miles a minute Hes waited twenty-three years to

talk about this

and hes got the perfect audience

DISSOLVE TO

INT KITCHEN MOSS FARM TWILIGHT

After dinner There are four empty plates

but only CW

tremendously relieved

and MALCOLM in the kitchen CW is scraping the bottom of
a wilted EVAS HAND-PACKED ICE CREAM carton MALCOLM
studies his sons quiet intensity in this direction fora
moment then moves very close whispers when he speaks

MALCOLM
(whispering)
Boy they expect you to go downtown
with em tomorrow

cW
(out loud licking
his ice cream)
Who

MALCOLM

(raising his own

voice infuriated by

his sons obtuseness)
Bonnie and Clyde

(he slaps the carton

out of CWs hands

whispering again)
Bonnie and Clyde

cW
Sure I always go with them

MALCOLM thinks hard about this

MALCOLM
better go then you better go
better go
(forcing CW to sit
at table)

--but when they get back in the car
to come on home dont get in with
them

cW
(genuinely puzzled)
Why Daddy

MALCOLM
You just listen to your Pa fer once
Caint you do that Im yore
Daddy Im your kin not Clyde

cW
(still confused)
Well what should I tell ‘em TI

cant get back in the car with you

MALCOLM is ready to kill--his sons obtuseness and his fear
of CLYDE is whipping him into a quiet frenzy

MALCOLM
(squeezing CWs arm)
No you tell them nothin hear
(hesitates then)
I made a deal and got you off with
a coupla years

cW
(a piercing treble)
Made a deal with who Daddy

MALCOLM hauls off and whacks CW across the top of his head
with the flat of his hand then momentarily holds his hand
over CWs mouth

MALCOLM
(we can see his own fear)
the law Just dont get back in
that car
(eyeball to eyeball)
And whatever you do dont let onto
them hear

CW suddenly smiles as if he knew something

cW
(expletive)
Whew You think them laws are
gonna catch Bonnie and Clyde in town

CW returns to the ice cream carton--MALCOLM lets him
figuring he better find out what he can

MALCOLM
What do you think Clarence

cW
(matter of fact)
They aint gonna catch em Dont
matter whether I let on or not

MALCOLM
(playing along)
Mebbe Just you be offn the
streets of that town when they go
to get in their car

cW
(looking directly at Malcolm)
Nobody catches Clyde Clydes got
a sense dont you know that Daddy
Nobody catches Clyde

MALCOLM knows better but for just a moment he stares at his
son fearing that maybe CW for all his limitations has a
sense about CLYDEs sense CW has finished with the
carton and crumples it licking the last remnants of cream
off his fingers

INT BEDROOM MOSS FARM NIGHT

BONNIE and CLYDEs bedroom the middle of that night Both
are wide awake lying on opposite sides of the double bed
Both are staring into the night disquiet

CLYDE
(suddenly)
Bonnie Bonnie will you marry me

There is a silent gasp from BONNIE a barely perceptible
stiffening Then she talks in a voice falsely formal still
staring up at the ceiling

BONNIE
How could I do that Clyde You
know its impossible Wed have to
go to a Justice of the Peace and
the Justice of the Peace is a
lawman We couldnt even take out
a license

CLYDE
(with a chuckle)
Hey now you sound like you been
givin it some thought on your own

BONNIE
(with a grim irony
her voice getting
more and more emotional)
Oh no I never gave it thought I
havent thought about it at least
ten times a day I havent thought
about it every minute of my life
since I met you
(suddenly her voice
cracks into tears)

She flings herself violently across the bed and buries
herself into CLYDEs chest her knees drawn up her head
tucked down into him her body shaking with sobs

CLYDE
(a bit startled by
this attempting to
hold her awkwardly
and placate her He
puts his arm around her)
Bonnieare you crying honey

BONNIE nods yes and slowly gets control over her tears

BONNIE
(her face still
buried in CLYDEs
chest she whispers)
Clyde why do you want to marry me

CLYDE thinks a minute and then grins

CLYDE
(in an attempt to be humorous)
To make an honest woman out of you

BONNIE is silent

BONNIE

(finally in a voice

charged with

anticipation and dream)
Clydewhat would you do what
would you do it some miracle
happened and we could walk out
tomorrow morning and start all over
again clean with no record with
nobody after us

CLYDE thinks about it a minute

CLYDE
WellI guess Id do it all
different First off I wouldnt
live in the same state where we
pull our jobs Wed live in one
state and stay clean there and
when we wanted to take a bank wed
go to another stateand

Suddenly he realizes that he has said the worst thing he
could have that it was not the answer BONNIE wanted to hear
He looks down at her his voice anxious

CLYDE
(continuing)
Bonnie
She is silent
CLYDE

Hey Bonnie
But she does not answer
EXT ROADSIDE EARLY MORNING

We see MALCOLM jacking up the back wheel of his pickup truck
which is parked on the side of the road in a wooded area

cut To

EXT ARCADIA STREET MID-MORNING

A street in Arcadia The car is parked BONNIE and CLYDE
walks toward the car carrying big bags of groceries and
supplies and put them inside

CLYDE
(looking around)
What happened to CW

BONNIE
He stopped off in that hardware
store to get light bulbs for his
daddy
CLYDE opens the door of the drivers seat and sits down

INT CAR ARCADIA STREET DAY

CLYDE
Boy my feet are sweatin
He takes off his shoes

BONNIE
(kidding around)
You plannin to drive with your
shoes off

CLYDE

He reaches in his shirt pocket and takes out his sunglasses
As he goes to put them on one of the lenses falls out

CLYDE
Damn
He puts them on
BONNIE
(laughing)
You gonna wear ‘em
CLYDE

Sure drive with one eye shut

BONNIE gets in the car rummages around in one of the bags
and pulls out something wrapped in tissue paper She
unwraps it and puts it up on the dashboard displaying it
It is a little porcelain shepherdess holding a crook in her
hand worth about thirty cents

BONNIE
(admiring it)
Isnt that the prettiest thing hon
Just look here you can see every
little fingernail on her hands

She shows him

CLYDE
It is a pretty thing honey

CLYDE turns on the radio and gets some hillbilly music
They are singing Little Church in the Valley He beats
time on the steering wheel getting a little impatient
BONNIE puts her shepherdess away and begins looking in the
grocery sack
BONNIE
We got any peaches I sure could
go for a peach right now

She burrows in the bag and comes out with a peach She
takes a big bite The juice drips down the side of her
mouth She looks beautiful

CLYDE
(he stops drumming
his fingers suddenly
has an idea)
Whynt we do it tomorrow

BONNIE
Do what

CLYDE
Tomorrows Sunday aint it We
could drive all night and be on
that golf course tomorrow morning

BONNIE
You sure you feel up to it

CLYDE

(enthused)
Yeah why not

(now feeling anxious

and excited he is

impatient to move)
Where is that boy Hes gone too
long

BONNIE
(humming to the radio)
Hell be here
(holding the peach to him)
You take a bite hon

CLYDE

(getting worried)
No its takin too long What if

BONNIE
Nothin happened

CLYDE
(more urgently)
Go take a look see whats keepin

Not too delighted with the chore BONNIE goes off We
remain with CLYDE getting anxious The music plays on

BONNIE comes back hurriedly now anxious herself

BONNIE
He aint there

CLYDE jumps into action slams his door

CLYDE
Cmon lets go

BONNIE gets in They drive off
INT STORE CLOSE-UP CW DAY

--hiding inside a store peering out through a curtained
window at them driving away His expression is disturbed
his face half in shadow

EXT ROAD DAY

BONNIE and CLYDEs car coming down the road Camera sees
from CLYDEs POV MALCOLM standing in the road waving
him down The pickup truck its back jacked up is parked
beside him on a shoulder of the road

INT CAR DAY

BONNIE
Whats wrong

CLYDE
I dont know

EXT ROAD

CLYDE reaches the spot pulls off the road and stops the car
He gets out Camera pulls back CLYDE talks to the old

man BONNIE stays in the car Cut to a shut down the trench
of the law tense

Suddenly a truck loaded with chickens comes riding down the
road from the opposite direction HAMER sees it from a long
way away and realizes that he cannot afford to let anything
pass between him and his quarry He decides the time is now
He leaps up from the trench and yells at CLYDE

HAMER
Barrow

The OLD MAN dives under his truck to hide The shooting
starts

We see the chicken truck Two men in the front seat They
see ahead of them an incredible shooting match and in
terror they jam on the brakes and leap out of the truck
They run as fast as they can into the meadow away from the
trouble

The gun fight takes just seconds during which law fires
eight-seven shots at BONNIE and CLYDE giving them absolutely
no chance The sound is rapid deafening

At no point in the gun fight do we see BONNIE and CLYDE in
motion We see instead two still photographs cut into the
sequence one of Clyde half out of the car taking careful
dead aim with his gun just as he did in the teaching scene
one of BONNIE in terror a pack of cigarettes in her hand
clutched tight looking as fragile and beautiful as she can
be

The noise stops at once Utter silence It has been a
massacre BONNIE and CLYDE never had a chance to return the
gunfire We see the car a complete shambles We never see
BONNIE and CLYDE dead though for a moment we discern their
bodies slumped in the car

The camera pulls above the car until it is on a level with
the opposite side of the road Then slowly the six lawmen
stand up in the trench On the faces of the five deputies
horror and shock at what they have just done HAMER
however registers no emotion His face is a blank He
lights a cigarette Slowly slowly the five men begin to
edge closer to the car to see the result Music the wild
country breakdown music begins on the sound track

Before they reach the car the camera swings away from them
past them and zooms out and above into the meadow where the
two truck drivers are standing--tiny distant figures

The truck drivers begin to walk toward the camera coming
back to the road to see what happened They get closer and
closer to the camera until they have reached a middle
distance and as they continue to walk at us it is--

THE END

CUT TO BLACK
