MONTAGE INT VICTORIA’S DRESSING ROOM BUCKINGHAM DAY 1
Female fingers are fastening hooks tightening laces

We are behind a young woman who raises her arms in slow motion to
allow her maid Watson to dress her

VICTORIA (V0)
I do not now remember when I first knew I
was different

MONTAGE EXT KENSINGTON GARDENS DAY FLASHBACK 1A

A little girl’s feet walk on a gravel path beside a woman’s heavy
skirts From behind the child holds the hand of a governess A
couple passes They see her and stop The man bows removing his
top hat The woman curtseys We see the young face accepting this
deference from strangers

VICTORIA (VO)

Or rather that my life belonged to others

besides myself
MONTAGE EXT ENTRANCE COURT BUCKINGHAM PALACE DAY 1B
A young man’s face is in motionless profile We pull focus to
reveal a whole line of Cold Stream guards all completely still
all looking straight ahead
MONTAGE INT VICTORIA’S DRESSING ROOM BUCKINGHAM DAY 1c
The red Robe of State is laid out on a chair A dog has curled up
on the velvet train Watson waves it away with a tiny shoe
MONTAGE EXT ENTRANCE COURT BUCKINGHAM PALACE DAY ID
The door of a gilded carriage is opened and gloved hands unroll its
steps down towards the ground A man’s stockinged leg and buckled
shoe appear to stabilize them A small silk-encased foot is placed
on the bottom step
MONTAGE INT DUCHESS’S DRAWING ROOM KENSINGTON PALACE DAY 1E

VICTORIA (VO)
T must have been about eleven or
thereabouts when they left a book open on
the nursery table

The finger moves across to the childless Duke of York “died 1803”
Next King William IV and his two dead daughters On to the dead
Duke of Kent his widow and finally his daughter Victoria “born
1819”

VICTORIA (VO)
The first four sons of King George III
could boast only one living child And
that was me

The tiny finger hesitates poised over the name

VICTORIA (VO)
And so I learned that I was nearer to the
Crown than I had thought

A young girl with ringlets and a simple dress is looking at the
book Shadowy figures hover behind A governess in black a woman
in brilliant colours with an elaborate hair style and a sharply
dressed man They study the child’s reaction She runs away

VICTORIA (VO)
And I knew then why I must trace a path
ordained by others

silhouette is in the doorway She turns her back on her mother

28th June 1838

Blurred faces watch as a young woman processes down the aisle They
crane forward to catch a glimpse In the high stands some faces
come into focus

VICTORIA (VO)
From my past

The governess Lehzen in a modest box of the Queen’s friends
glows with pride

VICTORIA (VO)
My present

Wellington looks on from among the dukes Peel is with the
politicians The Duchess of Sutherland hovers behind the Throne
among the ladies

VICTORIA (V0)
And my future

Among the visiting princes all resplendent stands a youthful and
wonderfully handsome Albert

VICTORIA (VO)
In truth I was glad to have them near me
at that all-changing moment

A young girl’s forehead is anointed with oil A hand fastens an
elaborate buckle The folds of a heavy fur-trimmed golden robe
are being arranged around the central figure A man’s hand lays the
golden Sceptre with its Cross in her right hand

VICTORIA (V0)
For even with the knowledge

The same hand brings the Rod of Equity and lays it in the same
young woman’s left hand

VICTORIA (V0)
That I was heiress to the Throne

The older male hands now take hold of the ermine rim of the new
crown we have seen being created

VICTORIA (VO)
Before that day of days I can’t pretend

Our view is loosening We are behind the great Gothic chair The
bare-headed Archbishop approaches

( )
The Young Victoria PINK REVISIONS andth Aug 2007 page4 li

He lifts the Crown and with a clearly enunciated prayer he sets it
down on the head of the chair’s occupant It fits perfectly

VICTORIA (V0)
I understood the phrase’s full
significance

We cut to a spectacular wide shot The whole of Westminster Abbey
is laid out before us in dazzling magnificence with gallery after
gallery tier upon tier packed with Government Court and
Aristocracy all standing all exultant The banks of peers
gorgeous in red velvet and ermine put on their own coronets while
the peeresses in separate stands reach up to place their coronets
among their head-dresses of feathers and diamonds Their long
white gloves raised in unison backed by the colours of the
costumes make their arms seem like a thousand swans in flight

The whole effect is more thrilling more exciting more glamorous
than can almost be imagined

At last and for the first time we see the face of the new Queen
of England She is eighteen soft innocent and almost childlike a
poignant contrast to the glittering diadem on her head proclaiming
centuries of tradition The title appears

The Young Victoria

As it disappears Victoria turns her head to look at someone A
smiling Melbourne is in the viscounts’ stand The premier mouths
“Perfect” As serious as the new Queen tries to be she can’t
refrain from the faintest trace of a smile Now we pull focus In
the background in a gallery defined as Royal by the coats of arms
upon it we see a handsome middle aged woman deeply moved by the
events she witnesses This is the Duchess of Kent As we close in
on her and see the very real emotion in her eyes a new voice is
heard

DUCHESS OF KENT (VO)
You are sure That we’re doing the right
thing
INT VICTORIA’S BEDROOM KENSINGTON PALACE NIGHT 2

We pull back from the same face and find that the Duchess
herself is speaking

DUCHESS OF KENT

Perhaps we should leave itMaybe tomorrow
she’ll be less tired

No longer in her Coronation robes she looks like a pretty painted
doll her hair dressed in the exuberant extravagant fashion of the
1830s A title appears

One year earlier

CONROY
Weve waited long enough For the last
time you will sign this order

Sir John Conroy the Duchess’s Controller handsome vain and
arrogant throws a cold look at the Duchess Striding past a
canopied four poster he comes to a smaller bed where Victoria
lies flushed with fever barely awake He puts in front of her a
paper on a board and with it a pen

VICTORIA
I will not sign it

CONROY
I say you will

He pushes the pen into her hand holding it over the paper

VICTORIA
And I say I will not

With a supreme effort she pulls her hand free and flings the pen
to the floor pushing paper and board after it as she collapses
onto the pillows His anger bursts as he pounces on it with a roar
lifting his hand to strike her -

LEHZEN
Sir John

Baroness Lehzen Victoria’s governess stands immobile in the
doorway She is a dour figure next to the weak bird of paradise
that is Victoria’s mother

DUCHESS OF KENT
Ah Baroness Sir John was just

She tails away How can she justify the scene

LEHZEN
It’s time for the Princess’s medicine

DUCHESS OF KENT
Of course Shall I

LEHZEN
Ill do it

fhe Young Victoria PINK REVISIONS 8th Aug 2007 page6 2

She remains stock still in possession of the room For a moment
the others stare at her Then the Duchess weakens

DUCHESS OF KENT
Well if youre sure good night mein
Liebling

VICTORIA
Good night Mama

As she speaks Victoria eyes her mother coldly Pointing up the
irony of this relationship is a nearby portrait of the Duchess with
her baby daughter Things have clearly changed The Duchess glances
nervously at Conroy and after a moment of angry indecision he
picks up the discarded pen and the paper The Duchess leaves She
passes Lehzen who sinks low into a court curtsey Standing she
turns her face away as Conroy marches out

EXT THE GARDENS OF LAEKEN PALACE BELGIUM DAY 3
The Royal Palace Brussels

In a sumptuous setting two men walk together one proud and
splendid King Leopold of the Belgians the other wizened and
dressed in black Baron Stockmar They are trailed by equerries

LEOPOLD
My sister says she won’t sign the order for
a Regency

Stockmar is not surprised Leopold waits for an explanation

STOCKMAR
Why would she sign it The Princess is
nearly eighteen Why would she sign away
her own powers

LEOPOLD
Because she’s an ignorant baby Because she
needs guidance and time to prepare for her
role as Queen And until she’s ready my
sister will take her place as Regent

The last is added lamely which Stockmar almost reprimands
STOCKMAR
Sir John Conroy would be Regent
Unfortunately the Duchess is controlled by
her Controller

This may be true but Leopold is exploding with frustration

The Young Victoria PINK REVISIONS 8th Aug 2007

LEOPOLD
Nevertheless I will not be cheated of all
Tve worked for because of a stubborn
child

Stockmar gives him a second to simmer down

STOCKMAR
Conroy has over-played his hand The
Princess detests him And the Duchess has
also forfeited her daughter’s good will

LEOPOLD
According to your spy Does Victoria know
her governess is writing to you

STOCKMAR
Baroness Lehzen has a wide correspondence

LEOPOLD
So What are you suggesting

STOCKMAR
When the Princess succeeds to the Throne
she’ll turn away from anyone who’s helped
her enemies It may be in Your Majesty’s
interest to consider abandoning Conroy and
your sister before it’s too late and
instead support the future Queen

Leopold looks at him Reluctantly he gives a slight nod

STOCKMAR
Of course the Duchess won’t like it

LEOPOLD
Baron I was born the younger son of a
penniless duke Now I am King of the
Belgians Such journeys are not managed
without hard decisions Besides the cast
of our play is not yet complete And who
controls a young girl most

A light dawns in Stockmar’s eyes

Two young men are practising archery The elder turns and waves
Baron Stockmar is on his way to join them He bows

STOCKMAR
Prince Ernest Good day to you

ERNEST
Baron When did you arrive My uncle is
well I hope

STOCKMAR

The King is very well But busy
ERNEST

What brings you here Business of his
STOCKMAR

His and Prince Albert’s

Ernest looks at his brother who releases an arrow which thuds into
the target This is His Serene Highness Prince Albert of Saxe-
Coburg-Gotha and he is as handsome as the dawn

INT STATRCASE HALL KENSINGTON PALACE LONDON DAY 6
Victoria and Lehzen are on the landing The governess holds out her
hand and with a slight sigh the girl takes it They descend

together to where a footman waits in the hall below

VICTORIA
Where is the Duchess

FOOTMAN
In the drawing room Your Royal Highness

Victoria goes towards a door followed by her spaniel Dash The
footman glances after her

LEHZEN
Keep your eyes to yourself

Naturally she is quite different with the servants

INT DUCHESS’S DRAWING ROOM KENSINGTON PALACE DAY 7

The Duchess Conroy and another woman Lady Flora Hastings are
poring over a map on the central table

The Young Victoria PINK REVISIONS 8th Aug 2007

CONROY
Well spend two nights at Norris Castle
one for the local gentry one for the town
officials then sail up the coast -

He looks up Victoria has entered the room with her dog Dash goes
immediately to Conroy At least the dog likes him Victoria
curtseys to her mother

DUCHESS OF KENT
How did you come downstairs

VICTORIA
I walked

DUCHESS OF KENT
Not alone

VICTORIA
No Not alone Lehzen was with me

DUCHESS OF KENT
And she held your hand

VICTORIA
She did Though why she still has to -

CONROY
She has to because not everyone in England
wishes you well

Victoria rolls her eyes If only Conroy wouldn’t stroke Dash

VICTORIA

I hope we’re not planning another journey
LADY FLORA

Sir John says -
VICTORIA

Thank you Lady Flora but I was asking my

mother
Oh So these two are enemies Conroy takes over
CONROY
As much as possible we want the people to
know their new Queen
VICTORIA

But why can’t we wait ‘til I am Queen His
Majesty clearly said -

At this Lady Flora smirks at Conroy Victoria notices

CONROY
The King is jealous of your popularity and
that’s why he doesn’t approve of your
travels It’s no reason to give them up

VICTORIA
On the contrary it’s a very good reason I
do not wish to annoy my uncle

CONROY
The King is old
VICTORIA
He may be old Sir John but he’s not dead

yet

Sir John eyes Victoria coldly

8 INT KINGS PRIVATE ROOMS WINDSOR CASTLE DAY 8

The white head of King William IV is shaking with anger as he
shouts at his Prime Minister This is Lord Melbourne a handsome
witty beguiling man in middle age Queen Adelaide is with them

KING WILLIAM
Is there no limit to this woman’s
disobedience

MELBOURNE
The Duchess wants the Princess to know more
of the country

KING WILLIAM
The Duchess wants the country to know more
of the Princess

MELBOURNE
Is it such a bad thing Sir

KING WILLIAM
To make her familiar you mean A popular
girl who supports your ministry You would
defend it

QUEEN ADELAIDE
I don’t think Lord Melbourne -

The Young Victoria PINK REVISIONS 8th Aug 2007 page1l
8 8

KING WILLIAM
You see how Conroy presents her The young
liberal in contrast to the old
conservative She is change and the thrill
of the new but I am stuck in-the mud of
history She is hope and the future while
I am despair and the past She is life
Lord Melbourne and I am death

He storms away for a moment The Queen catches Melbourne’s eye and
shakes her head gently She stands and walks over

QUEEN ADELAIDE
There’s nothing to be gained by shouting at
the Prime Minister

KING WILLIAM
Nonsense I feel much better

QUEEN ADELAIDE
And none of it is Victoria’s fault

KING WILLIAM
Maybe not But she and her mother are tools
in the hands of a man who knows how to use
them Mark my words The reign of King
Conroy is coming

QUEEN ADELAIDE
My poor sister in law What is the hold
that wicked man has over her

The question is rhetorical but the two men catch each other’s eye
and say nothing

MELBOURNE

What about her uncle in Brussels Could he
help

KING WILLIAM
King Leopold is as slippery as a barrel
full of eels If he did dislodge Conroy
itd only be to tighten his own grip on the
girl

He sighs and shakes his head Melbourne is very smooth
MELBOURNE
King Leopold overestimates her power As a

constitutional Monarch she cannot pass
laws to help or hinder him

( )

The Young victoria PINK REVISIONS 8th Aug 2007 page 12 8

KING WILLIAM
No We can’t make laws But we can
influence the men who do That’s what he’s
after And so are you Don’t tell me you’re
not

MELBOURNE
It is a Prime Minister’s duty to keép the
Monarch informed of Parliament’s
intentions

The sleekness with which he says this reveals his plans

KING WILLIAM
Lord in your mercy get me past May That
way she’ll be of age and we’ll have killed
off the Regency at least

MELBOURNE
And what of the proposed journey Might
there not be some benefit in showing her to
the people Before Conroy has a chance to
usurp her place

The King hesitates Melbourne has a good point As usual

KING WILLIAM
Oh very well Let England get a sight of
her future Queen But I’1l have no
broadsides No cannons and guns in salute
I’m still the monarch here

His face is as red as his hair is white

EXT THE ENGLISH COAST DAY 9
A fusillade of cannon blasts into the air smoke pouring from their
mouths On a raised and decorated platform with the sparkling sea
behind Victoria receives the Freedom of a seaside town from a

local Mayor A modest crowd watches them The Mayor bows and
retreats and Victoria steps back to where her mother Conroy

Flora and Lehzen are waiting

CONROY
Curtsey to them

VICTORIA
I have already curtsied

CONROY
Then curtsey again

The Young Victoria PINK REVISIONS 8th Aug 2007

With a smile she gives a slight curtsey andis cheered

VICTORIA
That’s enough

CONROY
I will decide when it’s enough

But Victoria ignores him looking around

DUCHESS OF KENT
Victoria Will you listen to Sir John

VICTORIA
Mama I’m not running for election I will
be Queen not Prime Minister

With a last nod she turns and starts to descend the steps on the
way to a waiting carriage The others follow but at the base of

the steps Conroy catches at Lehzen’s arm

CONROY
I warn you If you’re her friend don’t set
her against me

The Baroness does not answer but just looks at him

CONROY
You want to keep her for yourself but she needs
me If she tries to walk alone shell stumble
in a month and fall within a year For her own
sake don’t encourage her rebellion

LEHZEN
I hope I encourage the Princess in all
things Sir John
She nods towards the crowd behind them
LEHZEN

Like it or not they’re cheering her you
know Not you

She descends the last step towards the carriage and Victoria

INT ALBERT’S ROOM ROSENAU CASTLE COBURG GERMANY DAY 10

Close on a map of Europe Stockmar is putting Albert through his
paces Relentlessly

STOCKMAR
Your uncle’s throne is six years old and
born of Civil War He only took the Crown
of Belgium because England pledged her
support If he’s to survive he must have
English force at his disposal

Stockmar throws an engraving of Princess Victoria on the map

STOCKMAR (VO)
Favourite novels

Albert takes a moment to switch his focus to the girl

ALBERT
Err (He starts to answer in German)
STOCKMAR
English Always English
Albert nods This is a tough discipline but he will accept it
ALBERT
She hasn’t read many novels They were
forbidden until last year
STOCKMAR
But she did like
ALBERT
The Bride of Lammermoor
STOCKMAR
By
ALBERT

Sir Walter Scott

STOCKMAR
Other recreations

ALBERT
Drawing The famous dolls of course
Piano Music generally Though it’s hard
to believe she knows so little Schubert

The Young Victoria PINK REVISIONS 8th Aug 2007

STOCKMAR
Never mind Schubert She likes modern
composers Is she permitted the theatre

ALBERT
Only the opera and ballet

STOCKMAR
Where she admires

ALBERT
The soprano Giulia Grisi and the dancer
Maria Taglioni

STOCKMAR
And among the men

ALBERT
Her teacher the Bass Baritone Luigi
Lablache She calls him “Le Papa de Tous”

STOCKMAR
Why

ALBERT
Lablache says that Mozart is the father of
all music’ The phrase has become her
nickname for him

Stockmar is almost impressed He nods

STOCKMAR
Which opera does she like best

ALBERT
Norma

Stockmar strikes the table sharply with impatience

Albert sighs with resignation and resumes his studies as a song

STOCKMAR
I Puritani Her favourite opera is
Bellini’s Puritani How many times

three gaolers the Duchess Conroy and Lady Flora A half secret
glance passes between Conroy and Flora but Victoria’s mother is

more interested in the audience In crowded boxes on the same tier

Lady Flora walks on Then she stops

LADY FLORA
Don’t be too smug He could save her froma
lot of grief if she’d let him

LEHZEN
This is getting cold

LADY FLORA
You’re no better In fact you’re worse You
covet the same thing but at least he admits
it

LEHZEN
Please don’t judge me by your own

standards Lady Flora Or by those of Sir
John Conroy

The words disgust her Lady Flora shakes her head

she’s queen it’ll taste much sweeter

INT VICTORIA’S BEDROOM KENSINGTON PALACE NIGHT 14

On the last note of Bellini’s opera a simple Dutch doll in a young
girl’s hand fills the screen Victoria is having fun with her
doll pretending to sing The music ends Victoria is on her cot
Nearby the huge bed of her mother has been turned down for the
night The doll is replaced among other similar dolls all
gorgeously arrayed on a table by her bed

LEHZEN (0S)
Miss Agatha won’t stand up straight

Victoria looks up Lehzen stands motionless in the doorway The
candle on her tray and an oil lamp on a table throw odd shadows on
her face and round the cluttered room

VICTORIA
Then she must go to the back as a
punishment

Lehzen walks into the room exchanging a smile with Victoria She
pours the milk and hands it to the Princess The girl smiles her
thanks and sips it for a moment

LEHZEN
I met Lady Flora in the gallery

VICTORIA
Lying in wait no doubt

LEHZEN
She’s getting worse So is Sir John

Lehzen tidies the bed clothes briskly

VICTORIA
Of course In a few months I’1l be
eighteen If I don’t go mad first All I
ever seem to do is change my clothes and
pray for freedom

She glances at the double portrait on the wall of herself as a
baby with the Duchess She turns away to avoid looking at it

LEHZEN
It’s only until your birthday And don’t
forget who championed you from the start

They are interrupted by the arrival of the Duchess and her maid
She stops at the sight of Lehzen

LEHZEN
I’ll say good night Ma’am

She curtsies and leaves The Duchess eyes her daughter

DUCHESS OF KENT
You two are so close Anyone would think
you were plotting treason Don’t fuss me

She snaps at her maid who unfastens the glittering outer layer
Here is the deconstruction of a Royal icon The truth behind the
image She entered as Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Kent in
silk lace and diamonds her hair dressed with feathers and pearls
We will leave her as a middle-aged woman ready for bed As she
talks the skirt comes away then the embroidered bodice leaving
corsets and layer upon layer of petticoats She puts on a gown to
sit at the dressing table while the maid dismantles the high-piled
hair removing the false switches brushing it out

DUCHESS OF KENT
You still don’t look well Maybe we should
go away for August

VICTORIA
No Mama

DUCHESS OF KENT
What do you mean no

VICTORIA
We missed the Queen’s birthday We will not
miss the King’s We have accepted We’re
going

DUCHESS OF KENT
Really Victoria don’t issue orders to me
Im not a servant

VICTORIA
Youve already disobeyed about the extra
rooms That’s enough

DUCHESS OF KENT
Dont be absurd Are we to live like
rabbits crammed in a hutch Of course I
“disobeyed”

VICTORIA

We do live in a palace Mama We’re a lot
better off than most people

The Young Victoria PINK REVISIONS 8th Aug 2007 page19 14

DUCHESS OF KENT
We live in an apartment in a palace which
is far too small for our needs The rooms I
took were empty Keeping us out of them
was almost immoral As Sir John says -

But at the mention of Conroy’s name Victoria lies back

DUCHESS OF KENT
My dearest child Sir John only wants the
best for you I wish youd believe that

VICTORIA
I’m sure you do

The Duchess gives a sharp look but glancing at the maid she does
not reply studying her face in the mirror

DUCHESS OF KENT
I’ve invited the Coburg brothers to come
and stay You ought to know them better

VICTORIA
Why

DUCHESS OF KENT
Well because you should Your Uncle
Leopold thinks -

VICTORIA
I knew he’d have a part in it

DUCHESS OF KENT
Really Victoria there’s no pleasing you
You complain you’ve no friends but when I
find you some companions of a suitable
rank you look as if I’d forced you to take
medicine

Victoria just stares at her for a moment
VICTORIA
Mama why do you treat me like a simpleton
Is it my fault Was I unusually stupid as a
child

There is a quality in her that almost frightens the mother She
stares back then takes it out on the luckless maid

Conroy and Lady Flora hover at the rear Ernest walks with the

Duchess She ignores him looking ahead at Victoria who is with
Albert The Duchess glimpsed behind the young couple throughout
the scene conveys a powerful sense of Victoria’s incarceration

ALBERT
Of the modern composers I suppose Vincenzo
Bellini is my favourite

VICTORIA
What a coincidence So is mine Which of
his operas do you enjoy most No wait let
me guess I Puritani

ALBERT
As a matter of fact yes
VICTORIA
I used to like it too But now I prefer

Norma

out She takes a ball from her pocket and throws it

Albert picks up the ball dancing along beside the dog teasing it
with the ball just out of reach But when he looks at Victoria she
is not laughing just watching He gives the ball back to Victoria

She continues for a few paces Albert doesn’t know what to say
next Then suddenly he decides to speak from his heart

ALBERT
And Schubert I like Schubert I think
perhaps you don’t but I do

She looks at him She understands that this is true and not
prompted She decides to reward him for his honesty

VICTORIA
I don’t mind Schubert

Albert hesitates He is pleased but he has surprised himself

ALBERT
Good

He is very vulnerable In fact he has scored a point which we
know But he doesn’t After a second Victoria smiles

Albert and Victoria play chess again watched by the others who sit
round the room It is Albert’s turn He studies the board She
studies him Conroy notices but she gives him a cold look when
their eyes meet then lowers her voice

VICTORIA
Do you ever feel like a chess piece
yourself In a game being played against
your will

ALBERT
Do you

VICTORIA
Constantly I see them leaning in and
moving me round the board

ALBERT
The Duchess and Sir John

VICTORIA

sure half the politicians are ready to
seize hold of my skirts and drag me this
way and that from square to square

Then you had better master the rules of the
game Until you play it better than they
can

Perhaps to her surprise she likes this and smiles at him
VICTORIA
You don’t recommend I find a husband to
play it for me
ALBERT
I should find one to play it with you not
for you
She nods But the urge to tease is never far away
VICTORIA
Why don’t we ring for some music and then
we could dance
We can read panic in Albert’s eyes Victoria enjoys it
VICTORIA
I’ve lately discovered the Waltz and I am
quite in love with it
Albert looks to the Duchess They have been caught out

ALBERT
Waltzing is not really my forte

VICTORIA
Oh dear What a shame

Victoria gives Albert a provocative glance In spite of herself
she does like him She lowers her voice

Only that I understand more than you think
Of what your life is

I know She died

ALBERT
No That is she did die Eventually But
she was sent away long before that

This does interest her Much more than she expected

ALBERT
There was some difficulty It was all
hushed up and no one talks of it now But I
know what it is to live alone in your head
To smile when people are guessing your
thoughts and never to give a clue of your
real feelings

She appreciates his honesty This is also her experience
VICTORIA
Then youre right We do understand each

other Did Uncle Leopold ask you to tell me
that

He said I was never to mention it

VICTORIA
How little he knows me

She turns towards the stairs holding out her hand and he takes it
as he summons his courage to speak

ALBERT
May I write to you

She looks at him and without a word starts upstairs He climbs with
her waiting for her to speak But the answer when it comes is
only a smile It is more than enough On the landing they stop
She looks at her hand waiting for him to release it He does
after kissing it in homage Then she walks off down the passage
stopping once to look back The fact is he’s perfect

Lehzen is waiting as Victoria walks in a little out of breath
with a smile on her face She signs to her maid Watson to undress
her as quickly as possible

WATSON
I expect youll miss the Princes when
they’re gone Ma’am

LEHZEN
Dont be impertinent

Victoria winks at Watson as she is released from her stays

VICTORIA
The untold luxury of being able to breathe
again

Watson gathers up the discarded clothes and leaves

LEHZEN

come this far to walk straight into another

Victoria takes a deep breath then dressed in a shift and holding
an imaginary partner she starts to waltz What does she dream of
as she whirls round Whatever it is she’s more aware of what goes
on than Lehzen credits

Conservative Opposition is their pet hero
and Napoleon’s conqueror the grand old

No The next Tory Prime Minister will be
Sir Robert Peel

His voice is exactly in sync with the Lord Chamberlain’s

A stiff and formal man enters the room He advances towards Their
Majesties and bows then joins Wellington We hear

Which side does Victoria favour

STOCKMAR (VO)
The Whigs She is a liberal Or so she
thinks Above all she favours Lord
Melbourne And Melbourne will take full

advantage of it

Beyond Wellington and Peel we glimpse the couple enter They join
Melbourne on the other side of the room Wellington is gossiping

with Peel

would you give her Prime Minister

The company breaks apart to make a channel for the women Across

VICTORIA
Good evening George

Its clear from her brisk nod that she isn’t interested
KING WILLIAM
How can my little niece and nephew have
grown up when I wasn’t looking
Victoria slips her arm through her uncle’s
VICTORIA
Whereas you are quite unchanged and as
handsome as ever
He laughs and draws her aside from the crowd
KING WILLIAM
If I put my head close to yours and speak
softly they’1l suspect us of hatching a
plot

As he talks he does exactly this The company is subdued by their
curiosity Victoria plays along —

VICTORIA
And if I look a little surprised as I
listen they’11 know it

This she does with her hand at her mouth The company is almost
falling forward in their efforts to hear He laughs

KING WILLIAM
Ah my dear I wish we saw more of you But
then nor you nor I are to blame for that

He gives a cold stare at the Duchess but she looks away
Further down the room Wellington and Peel whisper softly
WELLINGTON

What do you make of the Conroy business
The Princess hates him No doubt about it

They look at the Duchess who is talking to the King

PEEL
I suppose they’re lovers

WELLINGTON
I suppose the girl thinks they are which
is more to the point

Across the room the King’s voice is suddenly raised

KING WILLIAM
Madam the plain fact is you have stolen
seventeen rooms

The Duchess is uncomfortable with the sensation created

DUCHESS OF KENT
One cannot “steal” a room Sir The rooms
are where you left them But now they are
used where before they were empty

KING WILLIAM
I-see So I have no say in my own palaces
Why not move in here and bring your Irish
tinker with you The Queen and I will be
happy enough in the lodge

This is very rude indeed The Duchess is icy in her reply
DUCHESS OF KENT
So would I Sir If I thought the people
there would be polite to me
The Queen steps forward to head off further trouble

QUEEN ADELAIDE

The Queen holds her husband’s arm and the procession forms

milestone Maam I hope it means well see
more of you at Court

They glance across at the stony face of her mother

VICTORIA
I hope so too Lord Melbourne

MELBOURNE
You know that if you should ever need an
ally you have one in me

VICTORIA
A Prime Minister has more important calls
upon his time

MELBOURNE
Not at all I knew the late Duke of Kent
well Naturally I take an interest in his
daughter

VICTORIA
You knew my father

This is a direct route to her heart As he planned

MELBOURNE
Is it difficult to speak of him

VICTORIA
No I love to hear from someone who knew
him For I never did you see

MELBOURNE
He was a great gentleman Of that you may
be sure

VICTORIA
Indeed I am

MELBOURNE

He was excellent company like his brother
the Regent But not so extravagant And he
was as kind as his brother the King

They both look over to where the red-faced white-haired King is
gabbling dementedly to his neighbour

Wellington and Duchess of Sutherland

Your leader is hard at work Duchess See
him hover with his net to catch the pretty
butterfly

DUCHESS OF SUTHERLAND
And when your party is back in power Duke
will you not do the same

WELLINGTON
Not nearly as well as Melbourne
Unfortunately I have no small talk and
Peel has no manners

Which makes her laugh

WELLINGTON
And I’d have a hard time praising her
father The most brutal officer I ever
encountered

He stops The King drunk and scarlet in the face has risen to his
feet He signs for them to remain seated The music stops

KING WILLIAM
First I thank you for your good wishes on
my birthday

This is conventional enough But his mood is darkening

KING WILLIAM
It has been a long life and an interesting
one and I shall be content with only a
short while more Just enough to dispense
with any thought of a Regency so I may
pass the Royal authority directly to that
young lady -

His voice is growing angrier as he points at Victoria

And not to the hands of a person now near
me who is surrounded by evil advisers and
who cannot act with propriety in the
station in which she’s been placed

Suddenly the company sees that he is punishing his sister-in-law
The Duchess tenses He is very angry now

KING WILLIAM
-I have been insulted - grossly and
continually insulted She has kept her
daughter my brother’s child from my
Court But from now I’d have her know that
I am King And I will not be flouted or
disobeyed by her or by that jackanapes she
keeps about her

He is shouting at the Duchess who blushes with rage It is too
much She stands flinging her napkin down knocking glasses over
with a crash and storms out sending her chair flying There is
total pin-dropping silence in that vast chamber Servants and
guests alike are frozen Victoria blushes trembling on the brink
of tears Wellington whispers to his other neighbour

take you from those whose sole aim is to
protect you

to a chair struggling to control his anger

unprepared for the task that awaits you

VICTORIA
And if I am whose fault is that

Conroy sits then jumps up at once He snatches one of Victoria’s
dolls and throws it to one side losing what patience he had He
walks back shouting in her face

CONROY
Youre too young You’ve no experience
You’re a china doll walking over a
precipice

VICTORIA
Then I must smash For it’s too late to
mend my ways now So if you’ll excuse me

CONROY
But I will not excuse you

Seizing her arm he flings her back roughly into the chair For
Victoria this is a savage shock The other women are stunned The
dog snarls The Duchess attempts to intervene

DUCHESS OF KENT
Surely we don’t need -

But he silences her bending over the shrinking girl

CONROY
Now here’s what you will do First you’ll
refuse the money and demand instead that it
be given to your mother Next you will
appoint me your private secretary from

regent with the Duchess until your twenty
fifth birthday Neither she nor I will
accept less

through the shadows across the floor She stops The archbishop

kneels Then the tall statesman drops to one knee Reaching out he

takes her hand and kisses it

LORD CHAMBERLAIN
Long live the Queen

It is both moving and awe-inspiring as the Courtier and the Prince

of the Church bow in deference to this tiny figure in a simple
nightdress with her shimmering hair

INT HALL KENSINGTON PALACE DAWN

Victoria comes out The Duchess and the others hover Already it is

clear that Victoria’s manner has changed

if I’m not ready to receive him

LEHZEN
Of course Your Roy -—

She stops

She goes down into a deep curtsey as Victoria walks by After a
moment so does her mother and finally Lady Flora sinks to the
floor Victoria walks to the stairs The Duchess stands

green baize They are in mourning and they stand as the small
figure enters goes to the throne bows and sits On their feet
throughout the men tower over her She’s nervous but also
dignified as she reaches for her speech placed nearby coughing
gently to clear her throat

VICTORIA
It is with a sense of reverence and honour
that I address you my Privy Councillors
as your Sovereign and Queen I mourn
sincerely the death of my dear uncle the
King but I know I may count on you to
serve me as loyally as you served him

She clears her throat again The men’s eyes are brimming

VICTORIA
I am young but I am willing to learn and I
mean to devote my life to the service of my
country and my people I look for your help
in this I know I shall not be
disappointed Thank you

She finishes and holds out her hand to the nearest man who
understanding what is required sinks to one knee

MELBOURNE
A welcome change after all those fat old
men

What about Leopold’s candidate

VICTORIA
That’s just it There’s nothing wrong with
Albert Nothing at all
Her mind wanders slightly then returns to make the point

Cant I be my own mistress for a while
Haven’t I earned it And dear Lord M’s so
very kind I couldn’t have a better tutor

QUEEN ADELAIDE
You may dream of independence but you won’t
get it From now on everyone will push and
pull you for their own advantage Melbourne
more than the rest Just remember you’re a
queen he’s a politician And politicians
whatever their creed always resent a
monarchy They pass through You stay So
just keep “dear Lord M” in his proper
sphere

Something in this troubles Victoria which Queen Adelaide notices

VICTORIA
He’s already chosen the new Household

QUEEN ADELAIDE
What You mean your ladies-in-waiting Did
you ask him to

Victoria clearly feels she’s on weakening ground

VICTORIA
I couldn’t do it I don’t know anyone I’ve
been living at the bottom of a well

QUEEN ADELAIDE
I warn you the public wont stand for a
liberal Court when they elect a
conservative government

VICTORIA
It’s not my business to pander to Tory
sensibilities

QUEEN ADELAIDE
But it is your business to make the system
work

Victoria looks at her aunt sharply Adelaide cools down

wives of his supporters there’1ll be

They start to walk away from camera down the passage together

Have I ever thanked you properly for
accepting the post I’m afraid it will
involve a good deal of inconvenience

DUCHESS OF SUTHERLAND
To be Mistress of the Robes is a great
honour Ma’am I’m only anxious to be
worthy of it

Victoria laughs But something is troubling her

VICTORIA
About my ladies-in-waiting

MELBOURNE
I’ll bring the list later today Maam
They’ve all accepted

Oh The Queen is slightly wrong-footed

VICTORIA
Only my aunt advised me not to be too
partisan in my choice

She laughs gently as if this is a joke He is very smooth

MELBOURNE
With respect Maam I think I understand
these things as well as the Queen Dowager

VICTORIA
T know that of course

MELBOURNE
And we want friends around us as we begin
our labours surely We mustn’t find Sir
John Conroy sneaking back to the table

VICTORIA
No Not if we have to line up every friend
we both possess in triple ranks

She is distracted and Melbourne moves matters briskly along

MELBOURNE
It’s very cold Why haven’t they lit the
fire

VICTORIA

It seems fires are laid by the Lord
Steward’s department but lit by the Lord
Chamberlain’s No one knows which footmen
should do it It’s not very sensible

MELBOURNE
Well if it’s the way things are done I
should leave it alone

Victoria is troubled by this

VICTORIA
But we must improve where we can If I’ve
discovered anything from touring England
it’s the suffering that needs my help

MELBOURNE
Never do good Your Majesty It always
leads to scrapes

VICTORIA
Really Lord Melbourne That’s not what is
preached from the pulpit

MELBOURNE

One hears such extraordinary things
As she laughs again there is a noise outside the door

MELBOURNE
Not in the least The Duchess is a
difficult woman

VICTORIA
Stubborn self-centred and always right

MELBOURNE
My mother was the same But at least she
was intelligent

Which elicits a guilty smile She glances despairingly at the
letters covering her writing table

VICTORIA
Youd think Mama was at the North Pole from
the number of letters she writes Before I
can answer one she sends four more

Melbourne notices a blue letter under the desk He retrieves it
studying the writing which is different from the rest

VICTORIA
I’ve made no promise to him

Victoria is actually embarrassed Her tone is defensive

VICTORIA
But sometimes I feel quite alone in the
world

MELBOURNE

You do please her Sir but perhaps it is
time to remind her why You will attend

MELBOURNE
Queen Elizabeth never married and it didn’t
spoil things for her

She looks at him but says nothing They stroll to where the
Coronation Chair stands She touches it silently

MELBOURNE
Youre familiar with the Coronation Chair
and the ancient Stone of Scone

VICTORIA
Familiar yes but quite in awe

She steps forward to touch the carvings to be alone with this seat
of her ancestors then turns back to Melbourne

The Young Victoria PINK REVISIONS 8th Aug 2007 page59
74 74

VICTORIA
Im terribly afraid of disappointing On
the day I so want to do it perfectly

MELBOURNE
The prison of monarchy Ma’am is that
everything you do must be perfect

Which is true enough to make her solemn He reassures her

MELBOURNE
Just be yourself Your instincts are always
to your credit

Comforted she looks round and catches sight of some rough-looking
workmen who have gathered to see her

MELBOURNE
They are preparing the Abbey for the
ceremony I’m told they asked permission
for a glimpse of Your Majesty

She smiles and waves They are shabby and poor but they smile
back calling God’s blessings on her head Visibly touched she
turns to Melbourne

VICTORIA
I do want to help them whatever you say
And not just the labouring poor but the
lost the hungry the homeless Whose
business is it to see to their welfare

MELBOURNE
These things are best left to develop
naturally Interfere and you overturn the
cart

VICTORIA
Prince Albert doesn’t agree He’s made a
study of the working man’s conditions and
he’s full to the brim with ideas for their
improvement

MELBOURNE
Indeed Maam How inspiring He sounds
ready to take control at the first
opportunity

He makes no further comment but his words sink in

He stares at her not giving a reaction

INT WESTMINSTER ABBEY DAY 76

The ceremony we witnessed at the start is almost over Victoria is
crowned Queen But this time it is from Albert’s point of view He
sees a man sleeping the Coronation ring forced on the wrong

finger a peer taking a sandwich from a page who’d hidden it
underneath the coronet he’s holding and a lord falling down the
stairs before the Throne This is quite different from Melbournes
vision Albert watches as the Prime Minister catches the Queen’s

eye and mouths “Perfect” Albert takes in Victoria’s delighted

smile and ponders what he is up against Bells are ringing as
Zadok The Priest reaches its climax

INT DUCHESS’S DRAWING ROOM DAY BUCKINGHAM PALACE DAY 77

is empty For the first time since the King’s death Victoria wears
colours and the effect is enchanting She is surrounded by visiting
princes Melbourne hovers watched by Albert from the edge of the
crowd The Lord Chamberlain bows

LORD CHAMBERLAIN
If Your Majesty would open the ball

Victoria looks at the men around her Who will have the honour Two
or three look hopeful So does Melbourne Then she spots someone
We stay on her face as she seems to be pulled magically to the
middle of the dance floor by a man She whispers

VICTORIA
Are you sure this is wise

Finally we see that it is Albert as handsome as always He takes
her hand and waist The music starts and he steps off firmly
taking the lead They spin smoothly round They’re so good
together nobody wants to join them and spoil it

VICTORIA
Youve paid attention to your teachers

surround them as they all waltz in harmony Then the music stops

ALBERT
Not stronger than you look to me

She quite likes this answer He never diminishes her

Only ‘til Friday Then home via Brussels
Uncle Leopold must first have his report

They share a smile at this as a quadrille starts to play

VICTORIA
Oh dear A quadrille with the Prince of
Prussia next My poor little toes I feel
sorry for them already

A tall man his chest covered in medals arrives to claim her with
a click of his heels and a bow Reluctantly Albert lets go As he
walks back across the floor he feels Melbourne’s eyes on him
These two are aware they are rivals for the Queen

PEEL
With sorrow I must inform the House that I
have been unable to persuade the Queen that
her ladies should not solely adhere to the
views of my political opponents I have
therefore informed Her Majesty that I am
not qualified to form a Government if I do
not enjoy her confidence

house and looks at the Speaker

SPEAKER
Sir Francis Baring

Mr Speaker are we to understand that the
mighty Sir Robert Peel has been frightened
off by a few frilly petticoats

This provokes laughter from his own side Peel rises again

Mr Speaker what frightens me is to see
the Crown used as a shuttlecock in the game

young for the position you occupy And we
were both right in part But not entirely

VICTORIA
Recent events would seem to bear out your
verdict anyway

You have been foolish Your devotion to
Lord Melbourne and your anger at your
mother both corrupted your judgement But
you have also shown the world your

holds a newspaper They fold it when they see him

ALBERT
Something amusing

LEHZEN
Nothing Your Royal Highness

But the Prince holds out his hand for the paper A cartoon shows
Albert counting scrubbing brushes “One brush per housemaid Any
more and Parliament will be told” He hands it back

LEHZEN
People always hate change

ALBERT
Thats true Baroness but mercifully few
of them hate it as much as you do

He goes followed by the cold and jealous eyes of Lehzen

INT VICTORIAS BEDROOM BUCKINGHAM PALACE NIGHT 134

Alberts face is as still as stone So is Victoria’s The tension

ALBERT

She nods and in a wider shot Albert walks forward and kneels
Pulling her to him he kisses her stomach

Victoria laughs as Adelaide hugs her warmly Seeing this the

Duchess rushes forward overwhelmed with delight
DUCHESS OF KENT
Mein liebling Youll say at once if
there’s anything you need
She tries to hold Victoria who pulls back slightly

VICTORIA
Heavens Don’t crush me Mama

The Duchess flattened retreats from the group looking round for
her reticule Albert comes over to her

ALBERT
Youre not going already

DUCHESS OF KENT
I can never leave too early for my
daughter Anyway I’ve a lot on my mind

ALBERT
Something I could help with

DUCHESS OF KENT
Just boring things

ALBERT
Boring things are what sons—in-law are for

But she kisses him and goes Melbourne has been listening
MELBOURNE

ALBERT
Lord Melbourne forgive me but you seem to
have confused me with a member of your
club I am not your drinking companion or
your whist partner I am the husband of
your Sovereign As such I will make my own
decisions and I neither seek nor invite
your advice Good evening

Albert walks off leaving Melbourne speechless

Open ledgers dense with figures fill the screen

CONROY (V0O)
I cannot believe I’m being subjected to
this interrogation

Albert sits at a table piled high with account books watched by a
furious Conroy and the Duchess

ALBERT
You’re not being subjected to anything Sir
John You have been in charge of the
Duchess’s finances for many years Indeed
you have made public statements testifying
to their health

CONROY
I have

DUCHESS OF KENT
And I am so grateful

She glances at her implacable son-in-law She regrets this now and
she would beg for mercy but Conroy spurns her glances Perhaps
because he has nothing more to lose

ALBERT
All I am asking is that you will be so good
as to tell us exactly where the money has
gone

Conroy’s flushed furious face tells us precisely where the money
has gone But the tragedy here belongs to the Duchess who
struggles to prevent her tears from flowing She has lost her
daughter’s love And all on account of this worthless man

CONROY

As a point of curiosity would you ever

have accepted my help If I had managed

things differently

VICTORIA
Not if my life should depend on it

Victorias face and voice could both be carved from stone

VICTORIA
Goodbye Sir John

CONROY
Goodbye Your Majesty

Albert decides to throw some oil onto these troubled waters

ALBERT
And when he does there’1l be no repeat of
the old problem Some of your ladies have
already agreed to resign Sir Robert will

Victoria looks at him and then glances at the Duchess who nods as
if even she were in on this decision Victoria is silent and smiles
pleasantly Peel smiles back

The Queen is incandescent with anger

VICTORIA
How dare you speak in that way to me before

ALBERT
I did no such thing

VICTORIA
Oh no Youve sorted this You’ve sorted
that You and Sir Robert You and the Duke

Would it were so simple Then we might
avoid more scandals of your making

VICTORIA
Have you lost your mind

But now he is getting angry And his anger matches hers

ALBERT
Do you wonder at it Less than three years
on the Throne and you and your precious
Melbourne have pushed the Monarchy to the
brink of an abyss

VICTORIA
What is my Prime Minister to you I’ve told
you before and I tell you again You are my
husband here and that is all

ALBERT
It’s quite enough believe me

VICTORIA
I will not have my role usurped I wear the
Crown and if there are mistakes they will
be my mistakes And no one else will make
them No one Not even you

He starts to answer Then he stops

ALBERT
I’m leaving Before you excite yourself and
harm the child

VICTORIA
If I do it will be your fault Just like
the baby Which by the way I did not
want And you will go when I dismiss you

He is shocked by her cruelty He walks towards the door
ALBERT
We’ll talk tomorrow when you are calmer
and feeling more grown up

She stops querying him with a look

MELBOURNE
Even a politician can be honest sometimes

She nods taking his arm as they begin to walk

MELBOURNE
The years spent in Your Majesty’s company
won’t be repeated They’ve meant a good
deal to me More perhaps than anything else
in my long career My guidance may not
always have been faultless and I am sorry
for it But I speak now as a true friend

VICTORIA
I know

MELBOURNE
The Prince is a good man A better man than
any of us knew

Victoria is surprised at this which he sees

MELBOURNE
He does not think as well of me but my
vanity is not the issue here He is able
and clever And faithful Let him share
your work Take him into your confidence

You know King Leopold plans to use him to
influence our policy
