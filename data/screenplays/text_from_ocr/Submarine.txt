CAPTION PROLOGUE

INT OLIVER’S BEDROOM- DAY

OLIVER lying in bed He gets up looks in the mirror
takes down a dictionary from his shelf looks up a word
ticks it off puts on a record and opens the curtains

OLIVER (VO)
Most people think of themselves as
individuals That there is no-one
on the planet like them This
thought motivates them to get out
of bed and eat and walk around like
nothing’s wrong My name is Oliver
Tate

We cut outside and slowly zoom back to show the town in
which he lives A caption A Winter in Wales a little

while ago’ Note we also do this in static non-zoomed

shots

lives Titles We end on a shot of a school

SMUTS CHIPS (cocky smirking) MARK PRITCHARD and finally
to JORDANA BEVAN (bored casually flaming the underside of

her desk with a lighter) OLIVER TATE watches her

MR DAVEY
What kind of young person am I
That’s the challenge We talk
about challenges don’t we Well
that’s the challenge I’m giving
you this term A gauntlet so to
speak But this gauntlet is also
an opportunity An invitation if
you will to self-discovery What
do I mean by self-discovery Mark

MR DAVEY
Self-discovery Who am I What a
question - let’s look at thatetc

OLIVER (VO)
I find that the only way to get
through life is to picture myself
in an entirely disconnected
reality - I often imagine how
people would react to my death

EXT SCHOOL - DAY 6

Six or so girls including Abby and Jordana are draped
over one another by a tree crying Blinking through the

glowing like Obi-Wan in STAR WARS He has a serene look
to him The GIRLS look perplexed

OLIVER
Don’t ask how Just know that I
am now more powerful than ever

The girls look back in awe

OLIVER (CONTD)
Lets get off

We CUT BACK to the CLASSROOM A

OLIVER allows himself a small smile He is staring at the
back of JORDANA’S NECK She looks round OLIVER awkwardly
looks away MR DAVEY is wrapping things up MARK
PRITCHARD passes OLIVER a note He indicates that it’s
from JORDANA OLIVER opens it It says ‘If you’ve opened
this note you’re a cock-riding twat’ He tries to pass it

CHIPS and KEIRON start to tease ZOE an OVERWEIGHT GIRL But mainly he sees how JORDANA is laughing and
delighting in the teasing
SUBMARINE 23rd NOVEMBER 2009 RED 4A

OLIVER (VO)
Lately I’ve become interested in
the theory of cognitive
dissonance

We see an appropriate encyclopedia entry

OLIVER (VO) (CONTD)
This holds that contradictory-

We TRACK into a TV - on it is a professor on an OU-TYPE
TV show he has an accent of some kind Perhaps German

SUBMARINE 23rd NOVEMBER 2009 RED 5

PROFESSOR
- contradictory thoughts or
beliefs serve as a driving force
that compel the human mind to
acquire or invent new thoughts or
beliefs so as to minimise the
amount of dissonance between such
cognitions or thoughts

We CUT TO a chart drawn by OLIVER STICK MEN Cc

OLIVER (VO)
It’s all about balance While I
essentially disapprove of
bullying I’m also cognisant of
the value of appearing to fit in
And further my need to socially
advance myself in school-

We see this on a NEW CHART A STICK FIGURE of OLIVER Cc
separated from a group by a hurdle titled ‘WILLINGNESS TO
BULLY’

OLIVER (VO) (CONTD)
- conflicts with being able to
show basic humanity to others So
I must invent a new thought
Perhaps Zoe’s so fat that she
doesn’t have real feelings

This logic is backed up by further line drawings We CUT c
to CHIPS running off with ZOE’S BAG WE SEE OLIVER DECIDE
TO FOLLOW

EXT WOODS NEAR SCHOOL - LATE AFTERNOON 9

OLIVER is running with ZOE’S BAG He lobs it over to
JORDANA who throws it to CHIPS CHIPS does some good
verbal taunts and ducks and dives Note we also do a
version where we start with Chips ZOE follows lamely
protesting

ZOE
Stop it Please

OLIVER (VO)
Chips is an outstanding bully He
once made our religious education
teacher cry using only blu tack

INT CLASSROOM - DAY 10

The RELIGIOUS EDUCATION TEACHER MISS DUTTON walks in
She has a distinctive mole on her chin She looks up at
the class Everyone has blu tac moles on their chins She
starts to cry and runs out of the room

CHIPS
What did I tell you I fucking
told you

EXT WOODS - CONTINUOUS

ZOE gathers her belongings up and clutches them to her
chest

CHIPS
That’s it Fat almost there

They reach a small stagnant pond They form a circle round
and chuck the bag between them over the pond

ZOE
Give it back

--

She manages to grab the bag from OLIVER there’s a
scuffle a shove and she starts to fall

The image freezes as ZOE teeters on one leg her hand
outstretched towards the pencil case We see close frozen
shots of everyone

OLIVER (VO)
I don’t know which one of us put
a hand to Zoe’s back For a
moment I imagine that she might
just balance there a fat
ballerina on one leg but her
foot slips from under her and she
belly-flops into the shallow
gloop

The image unfreezes and we see Zoe pushed into the shallow
gloop Her ruler pens and pencils float on the thick
algae She writhes around and we close in on OLIVERS
FACE

OLIVER (VO) (CONTD)
We all feel proud as Zoe begins
to sob shirt splattered green
stationery slowly sinking we
know that this would be one of
those vivid memories from youth
that Mr Davey told us about in
this morning’s lesson

The kids run away OLIVER stays there frozen He looks
between the fleeing bullies and the victim eyes wide his
face scrolling through various emotions

In many ways I prefer my own
company It gives me time to
think

We see OLIVER sitting in an unusual place perhaps a tree A
reading

Also - in a bath tub by the industrial estate Walking AA
along bouncing a tennis ball

OLIVER (VO) (CONTD)
I suppose it’s a bit of an
affectation but I often read the
dictionary My word for today is
flaigitious which means
‘wickedly shameful’

We see an insert B
Other times I’1l go to the beach
and stare at the sea as though
I’m in a documentary about a
prominent thinker who’s struggled
with unspeakable loss

He walks to the beach He looks up at the sky

OLIVER (VO) (CONTD)
But recently I’ve been getting
the feeling that I’m not quite

the levers of a life-sized Oliver-
shaped shell I’ve just turned
fifteen but I have the fearful
face of a forty year old

I was on Open University once -

OLIVER
Shall I show them the tape Dad

JILL
Stay at the table please Ol

him to a psychiatrist But he
said we couldn’t afford it

Good humoured dinner party laughter

19 INT OFFICE - DAY 19
JILL is in a boring meeting

OLIVER (VO)
My mum’s lucky because her mental
health problems can be mistaken
for charm and sociability
Perhaps her job’s to blame She
works for the council’s legal
services department One of the
rules in her office is that if
it is your birthday you are held
responsible for bringing your own
cake to work

We see a brief insert of JILL guiltily producing a cake at
work

20 EXT SEA - LLOYD IN A ROW BOATINT MUSEUM 20

OLIVER (V0O)
My Dad divides his time between
the museum and isolated lakes
finding fish that only he and
maybe four other professors in
the world would even know about
Adults are full of secrets

21 INT OLIVER’S HOUSE HIS PARENT’S BEDROOM- DAY 21

We cut to a shot of LLOYD lying in bed He wears a
TATTY OLD DRESSING GOWN and is sipping from a mug

OLIVER (VO)
For some time I wondered why dad
would stay in bed for days at a
time drinking endless amounts of
hot lemon using the same mug
over and over and never washing
it But then one day I solved
that mystery

A We cut to the BATHROOM OLIVER sees a bottle of anti- A

quizzical look with JILL

OLIVER (VO) (CONTD)
I’ve been monitoring their
intimacy via the dimmer switch in
their bedroom I know when
they’ve been at it because the
next morning the dial will be set
to half way

He writes his findings in his book We see a graph with
‘dimmer switch position’ on one axis and ‘likelihood of
parents’ divorce’ on another

OLIVER (CONTD)
I’ve seen their dry pursed
kisses grow ever more bloodless

We see a series of unaffectionate kisses between them

INT OLIVER’S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

OLIVER takes out some paper from a drawer He feeds it
into a typewriter and starts to type

OLIVER (VO)
Zoe Preece hasn’t been in school
the past few days so I’ve written
a pamphlet giving her a few
pointers on how to break out of
the victim cycle

We see close INSERTS of the following snippets “Weirdly
you’re not that fat You’re fat in the mind” “Maintain a
facade of complete indifference” “Transform any facet of
your personality to fit in” “You are who you pretend to
be” “If you must study do so in private” “Don’t cry to
the dinner ladies” Some are in italics some are
underlined some are in capitals

OLIVER (VO) (CONT’D)
I’ve also given her two examples
to inspire her

We cut to RHYDIAN BIRD He is in the playground and has
pulled his pants down to fart He is surrounded by
clapping pupils chanting ‘Rhydian Rhydian including
OLIVER CHIPS and KEIRON As many of our featured kids as
possible’

SUBMARINE 23rd NOVEMBER 2009 RED 19

OLIVER (V0) (CONTD)
Firstly Rhydian Bird He once
pulled his trousers down in the
playground to fart and followed
through coiling a unhealthy turd
onto the tarmac But instead of
looking embarrassed he screamed
with laughter and pointed Nobody
can tease him about it because he
is so proud I remember watching
him with renewed respect

We see OLIVER’S AWED REACTION WE cut to CHIPS

OLIVER (VO) (CONTD)
Secondly Chips He wasn’t even
considered that hard until Keiron
King famously stabbed him in the
back with my compass

We see this

He said nothing showed no
discomfort as his shirt blossomed
with blood poppies His stoicism
reminded me of the brave men who
died in the first world war
Every year on that day I holda
minute’s silence in his honour

OLIVER gathers up several A4 pages signs ‘Good luck Best
wishes for a persecution-free future Oliver Tate’ at the
bottom and puts them in a brown manila envelope He then
searches in his drawer for something It’s a ‘50p off’
voucher for a Burger Chain He pops it in

OLIVER (CONTD)
I’m not quite sure that I’ve
found my special skill yet I’ve
tried smoking a pipe flipping
coins listening exclusively to
French crooners I even had a
brief hat phase but nothing
stuck

WE SEE BRIEF INSERTS OLIVER behind the bike sheds with a
pipe
flipping a coin under a street lamp
putting on a Serge Gainsbourg record

Graham talks about how he was depressed after Heatseekers He
describes what Heatseekers was

He talks about how the gift is a burden and how people
thought he was mad - how he went to every eye doctor in the
country But he does see colours

You will not see colours but the principles may help your
lives - that’s all I’m not a magic man I’m not a shaman

Graham more often Then he’1ll start
giving her deep tissue massages

treated as suspicious

How deep is the ocean

LLOYD
At it’s deepest point 7 miles
but on average 6 miles is a good
rule of thumb But no fish could
live down there there’s of
course no light and the
pressure’s to great Any human
who was at that level would die

thoughts you must feel
OLIVER looks out of the window at the ape like faces of
his classmates Mr Davey’s voice fades out
INT SCHOOL CORRIDOR- DAY 166
Oliver has to walk along a corridor of howling kids He
glances as JORDANA as he rushes to his next class head
down
EXT SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - LATER 167
OLIVER is getting ribbed by everyone

CHIPS
Oh Jordana save me
SUBMARINE 23rd NOVEMBER 2009 RED 97

OLIVER
Fuck off Chips

He launches at him and knocks him to the ground

CHIPS
What the fuck’s wrong with you

OLIVER walks off

CHIPS (CONTD)
Let me know if you need a hand
killing yourself I’m sure your
parents would understand

JORDANA watches She and OLIVER share a look She is
standing next to her boyfriend OLIVER walks up to her

OLIVER
I’m sorry I didn’t come to the
hospital I thought my parents
were going to split up and I
didn’t want to look weak or for
things to change My mum gave a
handjob to a mystic and also I
was worried about the charter
Our charter and rule 3 in
particular but I was wrong I
think I was maybe frightened I
made a mistake It was wrong I’m
full of regret

This is the moment where you
leave him and come with me

JORDANA
Is it
SUBMARINE 23rd NOVEMBER 2009 RED 98
OLIVER
Yes Are you coming

JORDANA
No

OLIVER nods then runs off like a small boy
He runs across the school playing fields
He runs down a street outside

He runs down to the beach up the wall looking out and stays
there

EXT BEACH - AFTERNOON 170

OLIVER stands looking out He has been crying His eye is
caught by a figure quite a way off engaged in a tug of
war with a large GREYHOUND carrying a plastic bag of dog
poo He walks towards the figure and as it becomes more
distinct he half-runs He gets closer The figure turns
round It’s JORDANA

OLIVER
It is you I thought it might
not be but it is I thought
this’d be like the bit in the
film where the protagonist - Why
have you got a dog I thought you
were allergic to dogs

JORDANNA
Oliver -

OLIVER
Where’s your boyfriend

JORDANA
He’s not my boyfriend maybe

She tries to light her cigarette It’s windy and the
matches keep blowing out OLIVER takes out her RED LIGHTER
and helps They huddle together trying to block out the
wind They’re closer than JORDANA would like He looks at
her hands as she tries to cup the round the lighter

OLIVER
Your skin’s looking bad
(beat)
Your skin’s looking terrible It’s
probably the dog

JORDANA
I don’t care about my fucking skin
OLIVER
Why on earth did you get a new
dog
JORDANNA

Because I like dogs Okay
She throws the bag of dog poo at him

JORDANA
Why are you such a total dick

OLIVER
I’m not sure

I was crying earlier Look My
eyes are probably red

JORDANA
They look normal

OLIVER
Oh Maybe my eyes don’t go red
when I cry

JORDANA
You could have told me about your
parents

OLIVER
I know I should’ve

JORDANA
Youre not the only person in the
world

OLIVER
Do you think we can work things
out

JORDANA

I don’t really like you anymore
OLIVER

I don’t really like me either But

I think I have certain qualities

They look at one another She smiles

Ask me how deep the ocean is
SUBMARINE 23rd NOVEMBER 2009 RED 100
JORDANA
How deep is the ocean

OLIVER
I know the answer

JORDANA
How deep is it

OLIVER
I’m not going to say

JORDANA
I’m broken hearted

OLIVER
The ocean is six miles deep

The tide comes in and wets their feet They both stay
there

THE END
