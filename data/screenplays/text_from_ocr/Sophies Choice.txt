EXT AUSCHWITZ-BIRKENAU CONCENTRATION CAMP - NIGHT

TITLE MARCH 12TH 1943
It’s raining

A mass of JEWS stand alongside a train the sliding doors of
its freight cars still open from a recent arrival

They huddle together for warmth as NAZI OFFICERS methodically
separate them for selection Amongst the Jews is SOPHIE
ZAWISTOWSKI (early 20s) a young Polish mother of two

Sophie’s son JAN stands by her side clutching her
dress she holds her CRYING daughter EVA in her arms

An SS OFFICER approaches and stares at Sophie for a beat he
then looks back and forth between the children As he does
Eva continues to CRY

SS OFFICER
(in German)
You may keep one of your children

Beat as Sophie looks back confused Eva’s CRYING becoming
almost manic Then--

SOPHIE
I beg your pardon

SS OFFICER
You may keep one of your children
The other one must--

SOPHIE
(handing him Eva)
Here
Beat as the SS Officer stands surprised by her quick choice
SS OFFICER
(taking Eva)
Oh Youre youre sure
SOPHIE
(matter-of-factly)
Yep You can have that one

Eva’s CRIES turn into SCREAMS as she’s carried away

Jan stares up at his mother in wide-eyed fear
SOPHIE (CONTD)
(to Jan)
Come on I have to find a bathroom
Sophie walks off dragging Jan behind her

He looks back over his shoulder as if calling for help

THE END
