EXT SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAWN

It’s dawn somewhere in America The first hint of
sunrise glows on the horizon barely illuminating the
otherwise dark suburban street

Red taillights appear as a garage door opens a few houses
down the road An SUV pulls out onto the street

EXT SHOPPING DISTRICT - DAWN

The roads are still empty as the sky turns a lighter
shade of violet The SUV passes local malls and
businesses making its way to the interstate

EXT INTERSTATE - DOWNTOWN - SUNRISE

Office lights flicker in the distance as the SUV makes
its way out of the city Sunlight breaks over the
horizon reflecting off buildings’ glass facades

EXT INTERSTATE - COUNTRY - MORNING

Later the sun casts an even heat over farmlands The
SUV speeds through the country on a journey that seems to
take several hours

Eventually the flat farmlands give way to foothills
Miles ahead the hills compound themselves into massive
mountains The SUV disappears into the rising landscape

CUT TO BLACK

EXT EMMANUEL EPISCOPAL CHURCH - MORNING

The modest red brick Gothic revival church sits on the
corner of a small town street Behind it built much
later are the church offices and meeting halls

A piano plays inside the church It’s a familiar melody
just unsure of itself “Hey diddle diddle the cat and
the fiddle the cow jumped over the moon”

An old beat up Subaru parks out front JUDY (30s
nervous but well meaning) exits her car grabs groceries
from the back seat and hurries toward the church

INT EMMANUEL EPISCOPAL CHURCH - NAVE - MORNING 6

A YOUNG STUDENT struggles to read sheet music as his
PIANO TEACHER guides him through the notes They play at
an upright piano at the foot of the altar

Judy enters at the other end of the nave She waves to
the teacher as she takes a seat in the back pew dropping
her groceries down beside her

After praying she makes a quick sign of the cross
Collecting her things she waves goodbye to the teacher
and makes her way down a set of stairs and into

INT EMMANUEL EPISCOPAL CHURCH - BASEMENT - MORNING 7

The church basement It’s a large but cluttered space
The walls are covered with community flyers and religious
plaques

In an open kitchen ANTHONY (a peculiar young man in his

Judy drops her things on a table as she rushes across the
room and up a small flight of stairs into

He was a good athlete wasn’t he

JAY

He was he was loved sports I
mean he had lots of interests
but yes he was a very good
athlete

(then)
He actually didn’t want to play
catcher but then loved the gear
SO

Jay laughs then stops uncomfortable sharing

JAY (CONTD)
(back to Gail)
Do we have one of all of us

GAIL

(her mood is
darkening)

Of course Lots

( )

28 28

She sorts through her collection

JAY
Okay
(to the others)
We had to print some out Don’t
have many real photographs

LINDA
Yes

JAY
It’s nice to hold them you know

He lazily motions swiping a phone

LINDA
It is

Gail slides a photo across the table

GAIL
This was us

JAY
Oh that’s

GAIL

The last Christmas

JAY
Yeah okay

Richard and Linda look at the photo

JAY (CONTD)
Wed dress up Cheesy right

That’s what we’d say Instead of
“cheese” “Cheesy” Kids
thought these were you know
silly

Linda cries She isn’t consoled It’s as if they all
expected this

LINDA
I’m sorry

RICHARD
Don’t be

( ) 28
JAY
Yeah
GAIL
(taking the photo
back)

JAY

Maybe we should

LINDA
No I’m sorry

RICHARD
It’s fine Linda

LINDA

No I wanted to share too
RICHARD

Okay
LINDA

I wanted to share ours but

JAY
It’s hard

LINDA
It is

JAY

(beat aside to Gail)
How are you doing

(off her silence)
Maybe later

Gail doesn’t look well She gets up from the table The
others react but she only grabs the tissue box from the
book shelf and gives it to Linda

LINDA
Thank you
(wiping then)
If I could just show you

RICHARD
We don’t have to

LINDA

( )

RICHARD
Maybe it wasn’t a good idea

LINDA
No I want to
(to the Perry’s)
I brought something It was
easier to Not a photo if
Is that okay

JAY
Yeah sure you said Right

LINDA
Gail
(she nods)
Okay

Linda pulls out a mason jar filled with colored paper cut
outs like little origami animals

LINDA (CONTD)
So this is

JAY
Oh wow

LINDA
Yes Something he used to carry
around all the time

RICHARD
Couple of years

LINDA
When he was in fourth and fifth
grade

RICHARD
Younger than that

JAY
Okay What am I looking at

LINDA
Well he used to love collecting
snails

JAY
Really

LINDA
And he would

( ) 28

RICHARD
All kinds of things bugs
spiders things outside

LINDA
Yes that’s true he loved
collecting things outside
(taking over)
But snails

RICHARD
Yes

LINDA
He was just really fascinated by
snails And he’d collect them in
this jar and carry them around
wherever he went To school even
which caused problems

RICHARD
The teachers didn’t want there
was a rule

LINDA
You weren’t supposed to have
animals in class but they weren’t
really

JAY
(helping)
Sure yeah

LINDA
And kids thought it was weird
but

RICHARD
It was a little

LINDA
He just loved them But yes
kids thought it was
(conceding)
And they were messy

RICHARD
Stephen would his brother
would torment them various

ways

( ) 28

LINDA
There were problems with keeping
them this way and he would get so

upset When snails break
it’s

(brightening)
So one day He showed up with
this

She holds the jar up proudly for the Perry’s to see

displaying

the objects inside more clearly

RICHARD
Paper snails

LINDA
(a rare laugh)
Paper snails yes And some
leaves and a flower And I think
that’s a rock It’s a garden
For the snails And he said
“This way they won’t die”

And I think it’s we thought
it was so clever
JAY
That is yeah
LINDA
Or sweet
JAY

(smiles tightly
shaking his head)
God

LINDA
I thought it was
(then)
Well at the time I had some
concerns

GAIL
You did

LINDA
Not like only about his
sensitivity Really I was just
happy for him to

RICHARD

Find a solution He was always
determined to find a solution

( )

28 28

LINDA
Yes I was happy that he was

They fall silent for a beat staring at the jar Linda
a little ashamed puts it away

LINDA (CONTD)
Well thank you

JAY
No thank you for sharing
LINDA
I wanted to show you something

She looks to Richard for support He nods

LINDA (CONTD)
(changing the

subject)
So your daughter She’s doing
well
GAIL

She’s doing well Yes

JAY
Yeah she’s going to be fine
She’s so much more social

We miss her now She’s going out
too much

LINDA

JAY
Well I don’t know

GAIL

(definitive)

She’s dating

JAY

Okay

She’s really been herself again

( )

Rev mmddyy (Pink) 36

LINDA
Good

GAIL
She’s made a lot of progress

LINDA
That’s wonderful

RICHARD
(beat to Gail)
You mentioned to Linda you had
made some progress yourself
(to Linda)
In your letters A therapist

LINDA
Oh that’s right I’m sorry I
told him
RICHARD
(reassuring)

She just mentioned

LINDA
You said youve found someone
who’s been

GAIL
Yes she’s been very helpful
That’s right

LINDA
That’s good
GAIL
Yes She was is a big reason
we’re here
JAY
I see her as well
LINDA
Oh
GAIL

To meet This way Or to talk

LINDA
Okay You both see her

JAY
Well we

( )

28 28

Jay and Gail look at one another unsure of how much to
divulge and not in total agreement about it either

GAIL
We do

JAY
Yes um we’ve it doesn’t
matter Yeah she really
encouraged us to just express
ourselves not interrogate
(as if instructed)
We don’t want to interrogate

Richard and Linda nod but know this is impossible

JAY (CONTD)
“Curious but not defensive”

GAIL
(to Jay)
“Vindictive”
JAY
What
GAIL

She said “vindictive”

JAY
I thought “defensive”

GAIL
quietly explaining)
No If we are vindictive then

JAY
remembering)
Oh right
shrugs)
Sorry
then)

It doesn’t matter we aren’t here
to attack We’ve promised that
But we’ve meant everything
correcting himself)

I mean weve felt everything
weve said We can’t apologize
for our feelings

RICHARD
Thank you for your honesty

( )

Rev mmddyy (Blue) 38

GAIL
We want to listen and we want
to heal
RICHARD

(a short pause)
Of course

LINDA
(to Gail)
You know your letters while
they’ve been very difficult for

all of us I’m sure they’ve meant
so much to me Even the hard
ones I really appreciate
them

RICHARD

(off their silence)
We can tell you’ve done a lot of
work Continue to

(then)
And I don’t mean what you’ve done
publicly But it is admirable
How you put yourself out there
Weve actually Linda and I have
followed your work over the years

LINDA
Everyones

RICHARD
Yes everyone’s but

JAY
Oh well I don’t know Thank
you I don’t get pleasure from

it
RICHARD
It can be defeating That kind of
activism
JAY
Yeah it can but I don’t even

like that word I’ma I
wouldnt know what else to do

RICHARD
Your persistence is admirable

Gail gives Jay a pointed look He feels it

( )

Rev mmddyy (Pink) 39
28 JAY
Thank you but I’m not sure that’s
what we need to talk about today

Richard notices but continues anyway

RICHARD
I don’t think it’s not relevant
You don’t think as a country
we’re meeting our obligations

JAY
Well that was I was quoting
Obama but no I don’t I think
were killing each other We are

RICHARD
(beat)
I don’t disagree There’s just so
many factors

JAY
Okay

RICHARD
It’s hard to know

JAY
And I’m not saying it’s one or the
other see that’s
(looks to Gail)
Sorry

GAIL
Go ahead

JAY
I’m sorry
(to Richard and

Linda)
I promised I wouldn’t talk about
this today
RICHARD

We don’t have to

LINDA

JAY
(beat can’t help it)
I’m not saying it’s one or the
other
(MORE )

( )

Rev mmddyy (Blue) 40

JAY (CONTD)

That’s their defense it’s a

fallacy It’s a distraction

“Don’t look over here by guns

it’s over there my mental health”

As if we can’t address both It’s

insulting

RICHARD
Well exactly yes we can but if
your child

(regretting the word)
If your child wanted to hurt
himself would you only remove the
dangerous items in your home No
Youd want to help him Youd
want to know why he was upset and
youd want to change that

JAY
Are the dangerous items things
nobody needs

RICHARD
I guess my point is I worry that
certain legislation is its own
distraction

JAY
It’s fetishistic at this point
In today’s world It’s a fetish

GAIL
Okay Jay

JAY
Alright sorry I’m done That’s
it I’m done

LINDA
It’s alright I think we need to
be able to listen to each other
We don’t seem to anymore do we

(then)
I wish we were having more of a
conversation
JAY
Yeah well
LINDA

Or at least I’m sorry we might
be able to hear who is asking for
help

( )

be

e

Rev mmddyy (Pink)

JAY
Not everyone knows how to ask for
help Or wants to

LINDA
That’s true But you know
there’s a crisis center not far
from here I’ve thought about
volunteering and when you walk
in anyone you’re asked to check
in Anxiety fear sadness and
they do this every day I
thought how could you not be
honest

JAY
I can’t imagine giving a kida
chart every day

RICHARD
What about mental health
examinations alongside yearly
physicals You see your health
physician why not see a mental
health expert as well

JAY
Mandatory brain scans

RICHARD
Why not Most people in this
country can’t distinguish mental
health from mental illness

JAY

Who’s paying for all this

(then)
Sorry Look I agree we need to
change how it’s monitored We’ve
politicized threats so much we
don’t have resources where we need
them

GAIL
(sotto)
Why are we talking about this

JAY
Sorry

( )

e ee e HH

Rev mmddyy (Blue) 42

GAIL
Why are we talking about this I
didn’t come here to listen to

this
JAY
Okay I’m sorry
RICHARD
I didn’t mean to offend

(then)
I think we find through blame our
means to change and I want to
question that I want to look at
everything Because I blame
myself but I can’t change that

The Perry’s react to this seeming admission

GAIL
What do you mean When you say
that What do you mean

RICHARD
That I can’t change what I’ve
done

GAIL

So you blame yourself
(no response)
I’m asking You blame yourself

JAY
Hey

GAIL
(trying restraint)
No I want to know I don’t want
to talk about fucking politics
I want to know

JAY
(control)
I know but we don’t want to
interrogate right

GAIL
I can imagine it’s so hard to live
with his actions

RICHARD
It is

( ) 28

GAIL
But our loss
(control)
Please tell me what you mean by
that

RICHARD
I think all of us would give our
lives to prevent another tragedy
like it I would

LINDA
I would too

GAIL
Yes

JAY

(keeping the peace)
We all would Gladly

GAIL
But when you talk about blame on
your part I’d like to know what
youre referring to

RICHARD
There’s nothing that wasn’t
covered in the depositions

GAIL
But I want to hear it now We
never filed against you we never
took part in that

JAY
Maybe a better way so as not to
interrogate we can learn by what
we remember Right

GAIL
Fine Tell me what you
remember Tell me about your
son
LINDA
What would you like to know
GAIL
Everything I want to know

everything

( )
28 RICHARD
Why
GAIL
Why Why do I want to know about
your son Because he killed mine

This stops the

four of them cold

LINDA
(beat kindly)
How far back would you like to go

GAIL
Wherever you need

LINDA
(mother to mother)

Because

I can tell you

everything but there’s still so
much no one will ever know

Gail understanding nods

LINDA

And there’s so
ever know

much no one will

(she thinks)

He was shy Al
baby
never worried
one else did
didn’t play wel

We watched him

Even as a
But I
I saw things no

lways

that he was mean he just

didn’t seem to
(then br
Once he was a

would only want to be outside

But he was shy He
ll with others Not
know how to
ighter)
little older he

He

loved the outdoors

GAIL
I know this
JAY
Gail
GAIL
No I know that He was shy he

loved animals

everything

I read

( ) 28
LINDA
I don’t know what you want me to
say
GAIL

What did worry you You said you
never worried but what scared
you

LINDA
My son didn’t scare me as a child
(then)
The photographs I have The ones
we don’t want to look at They’re
of a boy That’s all youll see

GAIL
I don’t need to see him Okay

JAY
(to Gail quiet)
That’s not why we

GAIL
(to Jay)
I don’t need to see him

Jay nods choosing solidarity

GAIL (CONT’D)
(back to Linda)
What changed I want to know
When he’s thirteen he starts going
online or he starts that gaming
profile the account

RICHARD
They were not violent games
then

GAIL

I know but that was

LINDA
They were fantasy games role
play

GAIL

(let’s not go there)
I know But it was the same
account he used later so
(recovering)
I’m asking what changed
(MORE )

( )

Rev mmddyy (Blue)

GAIL (CONTD)
There’s this boy who plays
outside who supposedly loves
nature but now he’s indoors all
day online What changed

Linda and Richard share a look

LINDA

That’s very hard to answer
GAIL

Please try
RICHARD

There isn’t just one thing

GAIL
Then tell me more than one

JAY
Gail please Let’s not do it
this way

Gail looks at her husband then down She takes a deep

breath

GAIL
I’m sorry You’re right We’re
not interrogating

LINDA
What are you doing I say that as
compassionately as I can What
are we doing You say you want to
heal We all do Is this how

Gail stares at Linda unsure Jay tries to help her

JAY
We want to know why how this
happened Right I mean I

Jay chooses his words carefully

JAY
We want to hear that We need
your help with that

LINDA
I’m willing to help
(waits then)
We moved You asked what changed
We moved

( ) 28

RICHARD
(this is sensitive)
We did but we can’t be certain
which changes affected him most

LINDA
The new school or environment
was hard for him

RICHARD

Hayden He didn’t have close
friends growing up as I’m sure
you know but by middle school
that mattered more and it affected
him

(then)
A lot of things changed around
that age I had a new job
Stephen was applying for colleges
so we were looking at tuition
costs private schools We
moved

LINDA
Our older house had more space

RICHARD
(clarifying)
Outdoors Where we moved to was
actually a bigger home

LINDA
(a point of
contention)
Yes that’s true but where we
were had a great back yard

RICHARD
The new neighborhood was very nice
it was just more suburban

LINDA
Plots There wasn’t the
freedom he loved

RICHARD
(to Linda)
But it was nice

LINDA
It was Richard

( ) 28

RICHARD
The new school was hard for him
Seventh grade in particular
bullying

LINDA
It was very bad

RICHARD

Yes And the boys were a few
years apart so that Stephen who
was really thriving in high
school well he didn’t have a lot
to give Hayden at that time
unfortunately

(then)
Sometimes I wish they had been
closer closer in age so they
could have shared friends

(a loaded past)
We didn’t plan to or expect to
have another

LINDA
(painful past)
We thought we might be too old

but we weren’t

(beat)
He was lonely and I think missed
his how things were That’s

when he started spending more time
on the computer

(sincere)
But the games we thought were
creative we encouraged them at
first They let him make choices
or he got to be whatever he
wanted to be And we could hear
him playing with others He’d
laugh that made me

(then)
And he did well in school which
was confusing or misleading

RICHARD
He always had very good grades
He was very smart

GAIL
(without thinking)
I know
(catching herself)
I’m sorry I just

( ) 28

RICHARD
That’s fine
(then)
We had nothing to do with
publishing his grades or scores
Any of that

JAY
We know you didn’t speak

RICHARD
(hearing resentment)
I was only saying

LINDA
We mistakenly thought his grades
were a sign that things were okay

RICHARD
That’s not all

LINDA
We did Richard We thought
that’s what mattered

RICHARD
(beat a defense)
He wasn’t fitting in That hurt
But the grades made us look past
some of it

JAY
Did the school say anything

RICHARD
This was middle school not

JAY
I know I know but

LINDA

(some bitterness)
The school couldn’t be bothered
He was quiet with good grades so
he didn’t require attention

(something she can’t

let go of)
There was a math teacher though in
eighth grade

RICHARD
Linda

( ) 28

LINDA

No Hayden loved him And I
don’t know what their connection
was or why it was so great but
he made Hayden feel confident
when he didn’t I wish I would
have

(a missed

opportunity)
When he was really struggling
later on I tried to see if he
could talk to him But he’d
left for another school and I
didn’t I gave up trying to
reach him

(catching herself)
I’m sorry

GAIL
That’s okay

RICHARD

(trying to sum up)
He was teased because he had other
interests and I think that made
him embarrassed to have those
interests I think he saw being
different as a deficit He did
But we didn’t know or realize it
until he showed signs of

depression
GAIL
He didn’t strike you as sad
before
LINDA
He was quiet but no
GAIL
Violent
RICHARD

No Not then When we grew
concerned we got help

GAIL
When was that

RICHARD
(not defensive)
His medical history was made
public

( )

Rev mmddyy (Salmon) 51

GAIL
But was there something
specifically

RICHARD
No it was his unwillingness to do
things Once Stephen left for
college he became angry with our
attention for him

JAY
Why What would be wrong with
that

LINDA

I think he resented our concern
He wouldn’t even let us touch him

GAIL
And that’s when you got help

LINDA
Eventually He didn’t want to

RICHARD
He never did But we finally
forced him to see someone

LINDA
I felt like we had no choice but
he would beg to stop He pleaded
with us to let him be normal Or
that he didn’t need it anymore or
that the sessions made him feel

not
GAIL
What
LINDA
That they made him feel “not
human”
GAIL

He said that

The Perry’s process this

JAY
So what did the therapist say I
mean to you

( )

mmddyy (White) 52

RICHARD
He needs to stop isolating it’s
reinforcing his negative
expectations All the time online
isn’t enhancing his relationships
it’s making him lonelier

GAIL
So you stopped Or you let him
stop going

RICHARD
For a while Then things would
get worse or something would
happen

JAY
Like the pipe bomb

RICHARD
And wed go through it again
Yes That certainly had
consequences

JAY
Consequences Jesus

RICHARD
At the time it did He was
arrested

JAY
There was no consequence

LINDA
I know how that sounds But we
were devastated And we tried
everything But was the doctor
good Would they get the
prescriptions right Or take
insurance And of course we’d
pay anything but it was expensive

(pleading)

I’m just saying this was the
reality of how it was how
defeating and even with all the
professional advice it was really
just us facing these choices
alone But we did try over and
over You can see

( )

Rev mmddyy (Blue) 53

RICHARD
(letting her rest)
It’s true There is no new
information regarding his medical
or criminal records You have
access to everything

GAIL
Why didn’t you say anything to the
school This was high school now
right

Richard and Linda look at one another This was critical
to the lawsuits

RICHARD
We didn’t have to

LINDA
He had just started there We
didn’t want it to reflect badly on

him

GAIL
God

LINDA
I’m sorry

RICHARD

As long as he completed his
program his record

JAY
Jesus Christ That program was a
joke

RICHARD

They missed things We all did

LINDA
But he was lying

GAIL
Did you know that

LINDA
I suspected he was holding things
back But I never could have
believed

( ) 28

RICHARD
(protecting Linda)
I understand not speaking publicly
made us look like we had secrets

GAIL
It’s not secrets that I have
doubts about or facts it’s
knowing A parent’s intuition
(at a loss)
It’s your child You feel it It
should hurt you

LINDA
It did And we got him help

RICHARD

Everything that happened
afterwards the lawsuits the
media the hate that flooded into
our lives never once did we
feel ready or prepared for any of
it We just tried our best to
survive In fact many days
dying ourselves seemed a better
alternative

(to Gail)
Why not speak Because I don’t
have an answer Why not help
prevent this from happening again
Because I don’t know how

JAY
But you must have thought about

RICHARD
Every interaction I ever had with
him Yes Just understand
that until the civil statutes ran
out we were rarely given
permission to speak Even our
apologies had to be worded Linda
couldn’t join a mother’s support
group because they worried she’d
put the other women at risk

GAIL
At risk

RICHARD
Of being deposed

( )

Rev mmddyy (Blue)

GAIL
I didn’t know that

They fall silent seeming to reach a dead end

JAY
(remaining hopeful)
Well look I think much of what

happened in the aftermath was
wrong We know now how many
mistakes were made even from the
beginning just institutionally
Were all victims It’s why we
never filed suit Why we were
happy to sign waivers for today
We

(plainly)
We didn’t want anything

GAIL
(also plainly)
We wanted Evan back

JAY
Yes And that was impossible
And from what we could gather you
didn’t have answers like you say
but

RICHARD
In hindsight we would have done
things differently The
authorities would have too
(flat)
There was negligence That was
the basis of all the settlements

JAY
But this is what I want to know
What do you regret Where is your
regret

RICHARD
(confused of course)
I regret everything The worst
imaginable outcome happened Any
change I might have made could
have resulted in a different
outcome I regret everything

JAY
(beat)
How can you be so matter of fact

( )

Rev mmddyy (Blue)

RICHARD
How else can I be

JAY

No no the way you the way you
can speak about it We decided
against litigation but it doesn’t
mean we didn’t or we don’t

(giving up)
Want to see you punished I’m
sorry but want to see you hurt
Want to see

RICHARD
Like everyone else

JAY
Yes like everyone else
RICHARD
Like you
JAY

Yes Like me Like us Like my
daughter who doesn’t sleep

RICHARD
(waits)
Of course we hurt

JAY
Transparency I think that is
what we want I think we are owed
that Today

RICHARD
Then please ask what you need but
that is exactly what you’ve been
given

Jay pushes forward despite the feeling of going in

circles

JAY
Alright He made a pipe bomb a
pipe bomb and was arrested He
had probation or the program

LINDA
I was scared

Jay stops in his tracks

( )

mmddyy (White) 57

GAIL
What

LINDA
Richard we were scared I was
scared

GAIL
You were

LINDA
I was

RICHARD

I know Linda I

(trying transparency)
He told us before he had
contemplated suicide but only on
this test did he mention thoughts
of homicide We were scared but
I was trying to see the best
possible outcome

LINDA
We should have done something
then We should have

RICHARD
Now Of course now But what
And I couldn’t accept he would
throw away his future because of a
homemade bomb Linda please

GAIL
When did or where did this
interest in bombs come from
Weren’t you surprised or

LINDA
Yes

RICHARD
We don’t know Anywhere And yes
we were surprised Shocked

LINDA
He said he read it online He
said he was bored

RICHARD

He said it was just something to
do

( ) 28
LINDA
“T’m not the only one”
GAIL
What
RICHARD
Yes That’s what he said And

once he made it he figured he’d
set it off He went back to the
woods

LINDA
Where we used to live

RICHARD

No one was around He wasn’t
trying to hurt anyone

(catching himself)
Or he didn’t we believed we
hoped it was what he said it was

(before they can ask)
Later on when we found more plans
in his room he said there was good
money in artillery engineering
Working in the defense department
That was his excuse

JAY
How could you believe that

RICHARD
We knew nothing about it

JAY
But after everything else How
could you believe that

RICHARD
Because I wanted to Because I
I had to But I know now it was
just a way of making us think he
had bigger plans
(catching again
defeated)
Other plans I’m sorry I
thought he wanted to do something
with his life Something that
he was good at or made him happy
Because otherwise he seemed to
have stopped caring
(vulnerable)
(MORE )

( )

Rev mmddyy (Goldenrod) 59

RICHARD (CONTD)
We tell our kids they can be
anything right We teach them
that because we believe it I
did He told me things I
thought he confided in me I know
now some of what he said was
purposefully deceitful To keep
me away

LINDA
(to rescue Richard)
We really thought he was turning

things around We had plans for
the summer college
(then)

We were told
(choosing her words)
Once someone decides their fate
they do find some happiness
They can even appear euphoric
The last few months we were happy

GAIL
(beat disbelief)
He checked off homicidal thoughts

RICHARD

His therapist said it’s normal
GAIL

Normal
RICHARD

For a young man to be angry

GAIL
Why have the question if you
choose to ignore it

LINDA
I’m sorry

GAIL
(beat)
What about the anger Your
neighbor called the police

RICHARD
They called us Not the police
About a year before It was a bad
night
(then)
We would try to calm him down

Rev mmddyy (Goldenrod)

RICHARD (CONTD)
Minimize whatever it was that was
bothering him I understand now
that may have only intensified his
feelings

LINDA
He could be frightening

Linda conspicuously has little to say

RICHARD
He would get frustrated Easily
Frustrated with things he couldn’t
figure out It would

LINDA
Embarrass him

RICHARD

Yes And it was always hard for
him to ask for help but
eventually he just stopped asking
entirely

(painful)
Maybe my expectations were too
high I’d let it go thinking not
to bother him but then I’d be

(then)
I’ve done my accounting There is
no criticism I haven’t already
heard or placed upon myself

(to Jay)
We are not “impassive” as you
said

JAY
Ive taken that back
RICHARD
“Indifferent”
JAY

It was because you wouldn’t speak
You never really spoke out

RICHARD
We released a statement

JAY
Not that That was nothing Why
couldn’t you say more

( )

Rev mmddyy (Goldenrod) 61

RICHARD
We weren’t allowed to

JAY
No it’s been years

RICHARD
When we asked for privacy we were
accused of hiding something

JAY
No you could have said

LINDA
What could we say Please tell
me What What should I say
JAY
The signs
LINDA

But we didn’t know

JAY
After everything You couldn’t
have been surprised

LINDA
(pleading)
But we were We didn’t know what
had happened I still don’t I

just came home from work and the
phone rang

JAY
What

LINDA
(still with urgency)
A friend of his called the house
asking if he was there I said
“Aren’t you both at school” I
didn’t

JAY
Wait

LINDA
He said Hayden hadn’t been there
all day and that “something

happened” “Something’s
happening” I

I had no idea Even after turning

on the television seeing the

school from above what he could

be talking about I didn’t

We really didn’t know

Linda falters unable to shake the trauma
JAY

(can’t resist)
This was Alex The friend who

called
RICHARD
(Linda can’t answer)
Yes
JAY
Who knew
RICHARD

No He suspected

JAY
They were his father’s guns
RICHARD
He didn’t know Hayden had taken
them
JAY

He asked you to look for them If
you can ask then you must have
thought before

RICHARD

He asked because it had happened
He was there None of us knew
yet

JAY
But he asked you to check his
room right Or the closet

LINDA
Yes It was Alex He said he
wasn’t answering his phone and
that he hadn’t seen him “Can you
check” Yes

(then)

But I didn’t understand what I was
even looking for I thought he
would tell me but

( )

Rev mmddyy (Goldenrod) 63

LINDA (CONTD)
he just kept crying and saying he
was sorry I thought he did
something

GAIL
We all did

RICHARD
We never knew Alex’s family had
guns or that Hayden had used
them We learned all of this

after
GAIL

Where were you When
RICHARD

I was working I I have

events out of order apparently I
can’t remember all of it
(then)
A friend colleague had called me
out of my office the television
was on Everyone was watching
(to Linda)
You called me

LINDA
Yes

RICHARD
Once I was driving Id run to
my car and

JAY

Wait I’m sorry but

Jay stops story time showing some frustration

JAY
Why are you
(to all of them)
Why I don’t need to hear this
I don’t want to

LINDA
I’m sorry

JAY
No I I believe you I believe
you didn’t know I don’t want to
hear this I want to know why you
didn’t do something

(MORE )

( )

Rev mmddyy (Blue)

JAY (CONTD)
And why you never said anything
Jesus JI want to know why you
didn’t stop him

GAIL
I want to
JAY

What
GAIL

I want to hear

JAY
But I just

GAIL
I know But I want to hear

Gail looks at Richard and Linda asking them to continue
They look at one another finding their place

The Perry’

LINDA
I called you

RICHARD
Yes But It was hard for us
to speak

LINDA

I couldn’t I tried

RICHARD
Yes I could tell So I feared
the worst But
(still amazed)

I hadnt
(to Linda)
You said “He was never here”
LINDA
(haunting)
His room It was His bed was

made And there was this
notebook On his pillow Id
never seen it before but it was
worn and marked I was so
scared It must have been there
all day All night

s sicken hearing this

( ) 28

RICHARD
I didn’t know what she had seen
yet I was just trying to get
home But at some point I
thought “Why am I going home I
need to get to the school”
(recovers)
But then I got a call from my
sister She kept telling me to
“pull over” I said I would not
“IT will not stop driving” And
then we were both crying
(beat)
So I just I don’t remember I
pulled onto our street I guess
that’s where I wanted to go But
I was too late

LINDA
(surreal)
There were hundreds So sudden
All in black Helicopters

RICHARD
I couldn’t get near the driveway
I just left the car I still
don’t know who moved it back
They kept us apart They made me
wait outside While they searched
the house

LINDA

They put me in the backyard I
kept saying it was a mistake that
it was

(it’s own story)

There was a young policeman
Watching me To make sure I
didn’t I learned this later hurt
myself I finally asked him
“Is my son dead” He said not
unkindly “Yes But that’s all I
can tell you” As if

Anything else mattered This drops like a heavy stone
into all their hearts Linda cries softly

RICHARD
It was wrong what they did
Keeping us apart It was wrong

LINDA
It’s okay Richard

( )

Rev mmddyy (Goldenrod) 66

RICHARD
No They didn’t have to I
kept asking demanding to see my
wife
(to Linda)
I begged Linda

Something irreparable happened during that separation

LINDA
That wasn’t our fault
RICHARD
It was wrong
LINDA
(for his sake)
It was
(then)
Many times I wished he had killed
me too but He loved us He

told us He said he was sorry for
what we would go through

RICHARD
(clarifying)
In the notebook

Jay and Gail are appalled

JAY
He destroyed your lives All of
our lives

LINDA

He did But the love we had it
was real The truth is we
believed we were good parents
And in this awful confusing way
we still do

(off Gail’s look)
Isn’t it worse that I thought I
was a good mother I loved my
children Other parents I
wasn’t so different What did I
do so differently It’s very hard
to trust anything anymore I
raised a murderer

(beat)
And sometimes I don’t know if I’m
still grieving or if I ever really
have His service was in secret

(MORE )

( )

For the Perry’s this is a devastating thought

shakes his

The others

Rev mmddyy (Blue)

LINDA (CONTD)

No local church would memorialize
him

(humiliating)
Richard had to beg To bury his
son And when we found a
place I was so ashamed their
kindness

(then)
You’re supposed to tell happy
stories we hid So many
friends didn’t know what to say
didn’t come

RICHARD
(sees it differently)
We had our closest relatives with
us Good friends

LINDA

I remember checking the clock We
were so overwhelmed with blame
Our financial situation was
impossible

(making her point)
Grief felt like something out
of reach

(to Jay sadly)
I didn’t stop him because I didn’t
know And I didn’t speak because
I didn’t know how And I’m sorry
but I never thought I had enough
good to say

(then)
I want answers I do I have to
reconcile his actions with the
child I loved and raised But
there may be none And maybe
we’re the last people to ask

head remembering something

JAY
“We know the hate”

Jay

look at him He stands and walks towards the
table with food and drinks

JAY (CONTD)
Joy Murphy’s parents would say
that Their church Remember

(MORE)

( )

e

JAY (CONTD)
We need not know why the hate for
we know the hate” Or something
like that So stupid

He grabs a water bottle opens it and drinks

JAY (CONTD)
These are for us right

LINDA
I’m sure it’s okay

JAY

(re bottle)
Anyone want a

(nothing)
No

(drinking more)
But that whole church movement
afterwards It made me so angry
What The Devil So meaningless
And leave it to the Catholic
church to have the most bankrupt
reaction of all

(looking up)
Sorry

LINDA
This is an Episcopalian church

JAY
Oh right well Christian or
sorry I’m not religious

He finishes his water bottle and looks for the trash

JAY (CONTD)
They recycle

GAIL
Just leave it
JAY
Alright
(then)

But they found acceptance first
you know Or at least
understood it for what it might
always be But for the rest of
us who need reason what was he

( )

Jay crosse
standing

Rev mmddyy (Buff) 69

RICHARD
(looking back to Jay)
We knew he was troubled just not
how capable

JAY

What about the diagnoses Early
on At fifteen antisocial
personality disorder

RICHARD

We were told he exhibited signs of
antisocial and bipolar personality
disorder but nothing that would
suggest

s back to his side of the table but stays

JAY
No no no I’m not trying to I
believe you didn’t I’m just
I’m asking because a psychiatrist
told us afterwards that he never
would have shared his real
problems Or that he couldn’t
That

LINDA
We thought he might with his
friends We asked him to

RICHARD
He finally started making friends
again in high school He found a
good group

JAY
I’m sorry a good group Alex
showed him the guns

RICHARD
Hayden stole them His friends
had nothing to do with it

JAY
I’m just saying it’s hard to hear
you call them “a good group”
These were the kids going to gun
ranges playing Call of Duty all
day and night right Isn’t that
where that started

( )

Rev mmddyy (Buff) 70

RICHARD
It’s a video game

JAY
It’s simulation And the visits
to the shooting range How many

RICHARD
Only two

JAY
That we know about it And you
don’t even need to go with those
games now

RICHARD
If you’d allow me to finish
Addressing your point I was
saying by the end of his life
despite whatever was going on
inside he seemed popular for
him in his circle

Jay sits back down to focus his thoughts for them

JAY
Okay but what I’m talking about
is different

RICHARD
And I’m saying we couldn’t see how
isolated he was because he was
popular or not That’s not the
right word I know but we
couldn’t really know the level of
intimacy in his social life
From where he had been we were
just happy to see him have a
social life

JAY
Okay so that isolation

GAIL
But he was bullied in high school

LINDA
Not by his friends

GAIL
But still They told the police
how often he talked about killing
certain students

( ) 28

LINDA
He said they all talked that way
His group of friends experienced a
lot of bullying

JAY

And that’s fine now I don’t
care I’m sorry if I could
just get this out That
isolation even around friends
that detachment is sometimes
indicative of a lack of feeling
Or empathy Add to that the
thousands of hours online
Without any real human contact

(off their looks)
This is just how the psychiatrist
explained it

RICHARD
We understand the psychology

JAY
Okay I’m just Look what I
learned is there are studies
based on f£MRI’s brain scans
They say they can see the
responses or lack of response in
the brain That there are
actually less connections less
matter in the prefrontal cortex
and amygdala

GAIL
Jay
JAY
No wait please Have you

heard of mirror neurons

GAIL
Jesus Jay were qualified

JAY
I know I’m not an expert I’m just
trying to
(to Richard and
Linda)
I thought this was helpful The
basic idea I mean you brought
up brain scans Mental health
evaluations
(MORE )

( ) 28
JAY (CONTD)
If we could have seen or been
able to predict something
Because in these tests the
doctors they’1ll see

RICHARD
I know They show certain words
or pictures that should generate a
response some emotion or feeling
but they don’t

JAY
Right The people diagnosed with
psychopathy

RICHARD
My son was empathetic He felt a
great deal

JAY
But I’m just saying I’m saying
this to help you That it might
be helpful

RICHARD

My son was not a psychopath He
was in terrible pain

JAY
But maybe not treatable Because
did anything ever work How many
different medications Drugs If
it’s the actual structure of the
brain I mean that it is not just
pathological it’s physical

RICHARD
I understand what you want to say

JAY
So that it wasn’t just high
school or middle school it was

his him
LINDA
Do you remember Evan as a baby
GAIL
(beat am I
offended )

Of course

( )
Rev mmddyy (Blue) 73
28 LINDA

I remember I feel Hayden as my
baby every day His
helplessness his crying then his
smile

(then)
I don’t believe in what you’re
saying

Jay audibly scoffs at Linda’s sanctimony

GAIL
(gently)
Then Linda Something must have
happened
RICHARD

There was no abuse

GAIL
(she’s wanted to ask)
Not just abuse

RICHARD
Neglect We were there As much
as we could be

GAIL
And we can’t always be I know
but we have to correct their
course when we do have them

RICHARD
So we failed I failed I know
that I tried everything to
correct it And I would have
given anything to be there with
him

GAIL
But you were

RICHARD
If I could have known

JAY
Maybe no one could get through to
him That he wasn’t capable

RICHARD

( )

Rev mmddyy (Blue)

JAY
“Possible schizoaffective
disorder bipolar disorder
depression mania ADHD”

RICHARD
None of which are psychopathy
You don’t know what you’re talking
about

JAY
Take those medical records with
the criminal report I mean we
finally have the full report of
what happened Don’t you have to
weigh the evidence the facts of
what he did against the
relationship or history you had
with him

LINDA
He became them he wasn’t always
them

JAY
We can trace how far back he
planned this We can trace his
footsteps for Christ’s sake

RICHARD
I don’t believe the timeline
definitively proves anything about
his mental state

JAY
How can you say that

LINDA
We’re not denying what he did or
who he became

JAY
But I can’t help but hear you
blame a not abnormal childhood

RICHARD
He’s my son I can’t remove my
feelings from our history or his
records

( )

Rev mmddyy (Blue) 75

JAY
I’m not asking for that but what
he did his capacity for murder
was potentially there long before
anyone could have known

RICHARD
You think you can attach one word
to something in order to
understand it To make you feel
safe Well I won’t say it I
dont believe it It’s not
simple It’s everything you
cannot see and it left him
helpless He was helpless

GAIL
But it’s our job to help That’s
our job At some point it doesn’t
matter whether or not you see the
signs it’s still our obligation

RICHARD
I said I failed

JAY
And what I’m saying is that maybe
you had very little choice The
report speaks for itself

LINDA
He was gone by then he was

JAY
I mean the deliberate choices
RICHARD
He did not target
JAY GAIL
What How can you say Why does that matter
that
RICHARD
He would have said so
JAY GAIL
No he murdered people Or why is one better
JAY

What do you mean he didn’t target

LINDA
I don’t believe he looked for any
one person

( )

Rev mmddyy (Blue) 76

JAY GAIL

Jesus Christ Wait it doesn’t matter

RICHARD
He’d never met any of them

JAY
It was his school They were his
students

RICHARD

He’d never been in that classroom
before

JAY
He wanted to kill them

RICHARD
Those students they weren’t his
grade Evan

JAY
Don’t

RICHARD
I’m just saying

JAY
(quietly)
No no just don’t

RICHARD
He didn’t know them

JAY
He wanted them to suffer
GAIL
Jay
RICHARD
But not
JAY

(reeling on Richard)
What Not intentionally What
were you going to say

RICHARD

He didn’t seek out to make any one
individual suffer

mmddyy (White) 77

JAY
But my son did Evan suffered
So much And he let him
RICHARD
I’m sorry Both of you
JAY
No
RICHARD
I know what happened
JAY GAIL
No you don’t Wait
RICHARD

He did the most awful thing I’ve
ever known but I know the
report

JAY
(erupting)
No you don’t You don’t know how
my son died

Jay slams his fist down on the table

JAY (CONTD)
He entered Evan’s classroom at
129 PM He threw a bomb in the
center of the desks and stayed
there shooting for a half a
minute He could have killed
everyone in that time He chose
not to He watched them They
saw his face They saw the way
he looked He knew Evan was
still alive He knew exactly who
was hurt and who wasn’t when he
left
RICHARD GAIL

We could never see into the Please
classroom

JAY
No He suffered The first
gunshots happened at 129 When
the attack began He left them
bleeding dying Six minutes
Six minutes later He comes back
Your son To retrace his steps

135 He came back to finish

And Evan was there The last

neck his artery

He was trying to get out the
blood trails showed he was
trying to

Evan was still alive

RICHARD

JAY
No you don’t You don’t know I

NoHow he died

Jay is finished He wipes away a tear incensed by its
timing and slumps back into his seat Gail steps away
from the table needing to be alone She sits in an
armchair by the window They all need some time

It doesn’t matter

and goes to get a water bottle for himself

He takes small sips He sits down on a bench in the
corner of the room

RICHARD

(still defending but

for himself)
No I’ve heard all the
theories Was he a terrorist
Was he a white nationalist He
didn’t target any race He threw
pipe bombs into classrooms he’d
never stepped foot into before
He wanted to hurt the world And
he did

(then)
We went to the school Did you
know that That was supposed to
be for the victims’s families
Hayden would not be counted as a
victim but we fought for that
And we saw We saw the damage
The windows the black stains
We saw his hate

LINDA
The lines

RICHARD
What he did
(to Linda softly)
What

LINDA
The lines Or tape The outlines
of the children And Mr Moore

Gail winces at the memory

I didn’t know you were allowed in

LINDA
It was kept secret They didn’t
want

RICHARD

More outrage

(solemn)
The world mourned ten We mourned
eleven There were no memorials
for eleven no concerts reading
eleven names And I understood
that but I wasn’t going to be
excluded from that too

(making his case)
The damage though how much He
was in pain It was the pain that
brought him there

(then)
I didn’t want another child But
once he was born I loved

Hayden so much He was my best
friend We had so much fun
But maybe he should never have
been born

LINDA

No

(pushing it away)
Maybe we should never have gone to
the school I just remember this
terrible feeling of awe Just
awe for what my boy had done And
then this long skinny frame
outlined on the carpet All
alone

(strange)
I knew it was him Not because of
where it was or I just knew it
was him

JAY
I recognized Evan too Just
like Not because of the lines
but the number The number
markers For the report

Rev mmddyy (Salmon)

LINDA
Yes

JAY
He was number one He was the
first they found I guess But he
was he was my he was
mine

Sorry That was hard

Linda nods sadly finding comfort in their shared pain

LINDA
It was But you know and please
forgive me it made me feel like
the rest of you

Gail reacts in the corner with a soft cry Jay looks at

his wife then to Linda

JAY
Some parent I can’t remember who
said early on in a mean way
meant to be mean that you were
“the loneliest people in the
world” As if that was justice
As if

LINDA
Well we were

RICHARD
We still receive mail At least I
do Some hateful some
sympathetic most just strange

LINDA
Yes I never understood it’s
purpose
(beat)

It only reminded me of what he
did when I just wanted to heal
or restore my memory of who he
was

(then)
And that’s what I have to do you
understand You said he destroyed
our lives Yes he did But
while I know the world would have
been better without him

I’m sorry I know that’s

No

Linda stands sensing Gail’s pain and moves towards her

They look at Gail

LINDA

I shouldn’t have said that I
just I thought I had to

believe my son’s life had no value

because of what he did before he
died I don’t have to believe

that Do I
(to both of them)

Or is that hard for you to hear

JAY
I guess Yes it is

GAIL

But I
won’t tell you how to keep your

you to feel that way

No No that’s not it

Hey

No please

Linda takes Gail’s chair and brings it over to sit by
her The two woman face one another near the window

LINDA
What did you promise him
GAIL
I I promised him that his life

would mean something That it
wouldn’t be in vain That because
of him all of them there would
be change

She looks at Jay broken crying

GAIL (CONTD)
But nothing has changed Nothing
The only difference is that
they’re gone And that’s all I
hear Still I hear all those
parents The last of us left in
that fire house The loneliest
people in the world Asking
“What do you mean ‘They’re gone’
Gone where Where have they
gone”

(lost)

So you talk about value Their
lives having value That’s all
that I want I just want it to
mean something I want it to
change

LINDA
Why does it have to

LINDA

Tell me a story about Evan

Sixth grade I don’t know He’s
young It’s fall He’s playing
football with his friends They
would play in the park by our

GAIL (CONTD)
That’s how you spot the best
players on the team they have the
grass and stains on their
jerseys” I said he was so
funny I said “Shouldn’t the good
players not be tackled and fall on
the ground so much” “No mom
the best players are the
dirtiest” Okay He was like that
about everything He’d have these
strong opinions didn’t matter if
he knew anything about what he was
talking about

through tears Richard joins the others with
box

GAIL
So of course it’s five or
almost five and he’s not back yet
And I’m all ready to just go down
there and grab him Drag him
back When Sophie comes in the
door She followed Evan
everywhere back then She loved
watching the boys play and goof
around So she bursts in the
house and says “Oh my gosh mom
look at Evan” I come around the
corner and he is like head to
toe covered in mud

JAY
It was absurd

GAIL
It was He must have tried to
like cover himself like a mud
bath It didn’t really make any
sense even So I lost it
“Evan what did you do”

JAY
He was totally unfazed

GAIL
Yeah right He played it cool
He said “Mom I told you The

best players” you know I was
so mad And then I was
laughing

(back to sadness but
it’s different)

GAIL (CONTD)
And then hugging him And the
dirt the grass that smell Wet
leaves The child on him I
could feel so much life We let
him go to dinner that way

JAY
(come on)
He washed his face

GAIL
Yeah but he was so proud

LINDA
(beat)
That’s what his life meant Let
him rest Evan doesn’t have to
change the world

GAIL
But I still miss him

LINDA
Do you remember what you wrote me

GAIL
Oh God I wrote you way too much

LINDA
(laughs)
You wrote me that you wanted me
“to know your son Know his
name”

But this breaks through Gail looks at Linda amazed

LINDA (CONTD)
beat to Jay)
Do you have a story

JAY
shaking his head)
Oh God All of them but
to Gail)

Gail has gone somewhere else

GAIL
(scared)
Jay

( )

Rev mmddyy (Blue)

JAY
Yeah

GAIL
I think I need to

JAY

GAIL
I think I’m ready

JAY
(beat understanding)
Okay
GAIL
(to Richard and
Linda)
I need to tell you I wanted so
badly for you to be an example
or punished I came here hoping
for that
(to Linda
vulnerable)
But something’s died in all of

us All of us And I’m so scared
that what I wanted or what I
need isn’t what I thought

LINDA
What did you think

GAIL
That if I forgave you I’d lose
him

LINDA
No

GAIL
Yes But maybe I just
needed to be with you because I

know I forgive you

Linda cries

GAIL
(letting go)
I have I forgive you
(pushing through)
And I want you to know
(not turning back)
(MORE )

Rev mmddyy (Blue)

GAIL (CONTD)

I want you to know That I also
forgive Hayden For what he did
For taking my baby’s life Because
I know in my heart he was lost
And because

(to Jay)
I can’t live this way anymore

JAY
Sweetheart

GAIL
(shaking her head)
I can’t We can’t

JAY
Hey

GAIL
No We don’t sleep We don’t
breathe We don’t see each other
anymore We don’t And I want us
to again

JAY
Okay
GAIL
I want us to
He nods crying
GAIL

Okay Because I can’t hold on
to this It’s not him It’s

not it’s this just terrible
pain from wishing for a different
past And I can’t let it control

my life Because if I do I’m
afraid I really won’t ever see
Evan again And I know I know
I will be with him again I will
feel him against me if I can
forgive and if I can love
again And so I do I do

Empty of tears she breathes

The four of them fall into a deep exhausted silence

After a while Linda offers a way out

( )

Rev mmddyy (Pink) 91

LINDA
Maybe this is right
(sheepishly)
A moment of silence Maybe this
the way to say goodbye

JAY
Sure That’s I like that
Should we

LINDA
Youre fine

They attempt eye contact like a clumsy toast and then
go quiet Heads bow slightly and they do their best to
say goodbye - say a prayer

Richard breaks first raising his head with a confident
exhale The others eventually come up for air

RICHARD
Well Thank you again I hope
we were able to help

A formality has returned

JAY
Yeah is that it

Jay surprising himself doesn’t want to leave

GAIL
I think so
(then)
I’m exhausted

JAY
(looking for help)
Okay well if we feel like I

Judy’s voice joins in having been included in the search

Jay returns handing Linda and Gail each a water bottle

He stays standing awkwardly Linda looks for an exit

on the wall

She closes the door behind her

Linda steps towards Gail

He was sixteen He’d had such a

But I couldn’t just let him fall
apart

to talk but he wouldn’t talk
Finally I went to his room He
was on the computer I yelled at
him “You have to start working

( ) 30
LINDA (CONTD)

If you can’t be happy at least
you can do well” But he screamed
at me “I don’t want to be happy
I don’t want to do well” “Why”
I cried “Why” Then we were
screaming at each other We were
both so hurt And scared I know
it It happened so fast but he
said “Get out before I hit you
Get out before I beat the shit out
of you I swear to god” He was
terrifying

(ashamed)
I went to my room and I locked the
door

(her burden her

wisdom)
Gail I wish I had let him I
wish I had said “Okay Hit me
You hit me sweetheart Hit me as
long as youll ever need”
Because then I would have know
him I would have known who he
really was

Gail doesn’t know what to say at first

GAIL
It’s okay You can have me

into his eyes She smiles at him She embraces him
