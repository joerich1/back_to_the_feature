INT MINIVAN — DAY

Open hard on the passenger seat of a speeding minivan where
a MALE TEENAGER is slumped against his blood-stained window
He’s dead and a distinctly female voice is screaming in
recognition of this horror

Pull out to reveal that this voice belongs to the minivan’s
driver the late teen’s MOTHER who’s presumably racing to a
hospital

MOTHER
Why Why is this happening

Pull out even more to reveal two more DEAD BOYS in the back
seats of the vehicle More subtle this time They’re
slumped over their PSPs We can’t see their faces

MOTHER
Just hold on I’m going to get you
help I’m--

The mother is cut off mid-sentence by EXPLODING GLASS as her
windshield ruptures on impact with another vehicle

EXT NEW JERSEY INTERSECTION - CONTINUING
Cut outside as a SPEEDING FIRE TRUCK runs a red light and
easily KNOCKS ASIDE the minivan that dared cross its path
INT FIRE TRUCK - CONTINUING
Behind the wheel a rock-hard FEMALE FIREFIGHTER shakes her
head at the smaller vehicle that stupidly ignored her blaring
sirens
FEMALE FIREFIGHTER

Fuckin’ women drivers
EXT NEW JERSEY STREET - CONTINUING
Outside the street is LITTERED with crashed cars most of
which contain the CORPSES of recently deceased male drivers
A few small FIRES dot the landscape This looks more like

Fallujah than Jersey

The fire truck reluctantly slows to a halt as it confronts a
JERSEY CITY POLICE CAR parked in the middle of the road
Outside the squaddie a Hispanic FEMALE POLICE OFFICER is
cradling the lifeless body of her MALE PARTNER whose face is
smeared with fresh blood

The female firefighter hops out of her vehicle to assist her
sister-in-arms

FEMALE FIREFIGHTER

Marianella

POLICEWOMAN
They’re dead Nat The whole
precinct

FEMALE FIREFIGHTER
I know I’m the only one left from
Ladder Ten It’s it’s gotta be
Al Qaeda Smallpox or something

POLICEWOMAN
Then why are we okay Why aren’t
we--

The female officer is interrupted by the sudden arrival of an
AMBULANCE which screeches to a halt inches from the two
other emergency vehicles A FEMALE EMT hops out and sprints
over to the other uniformed women

FEMALE EMT
What the hell is happening
Dispatch says I’m the only bus
responding to calls

FEMALE FIREFIGHTER
Is your dispatcher a woman

Suddenly a WAILING SOUND is heard like a distant wounded
animal

FEMALE EMT
What difference does that make

The sound grows louder
POLICEWOMAN
Is your dispatcher a fucking

woman

FEMALE EMT
Yuh--yes Yes Why

The women raise their voices to compete with the alien sound
which is even louder now
POLICEWOMAN
It’s the men All of the men are--

Pull out as the sound reveals itself to be a BOEING 747
It’s falling out of the goddamn sky

A split-second before the plummeting aircraft crashes into
this unlucky trio we SMASH CUT to

Did you know Elvis had a twin
brother

INT OFFICE - MORNING

Inside a tastefully decorated office we learn that the voice
behind this non sequitur belongs to YORICK BROWN an oddly
attractive 20-something white guy who looks all wrong in a
tie He’s wearing one anyway Yorick’s staring right at us
as he nervously rambles

YORICK
It’s true Jesse Garon Presley He
was an identical twin stillborn
a few minutes before Gladys gave
birth to the King They buried him
in a shoebox How insane is that I
mean what if Jesse had lived and
Elvis had died Or vice versa It’s
destiny right Why does fate
choose one man over another and all
that

Cut across the desk to the unimpressed FEMALE EXECUTIVE who’s
apparently been interviewing Yorick

FEMALE EXECUTIVE
And that’s why we should hire you
to be an assistant editor

YORICK
I’m just saying I’m more Elvis
than Jesse Plus I’m a ninja with
the grammar Ma’am

The woman looks over Yorick’s resume
FEMALE EXECUTIVE
You haven’t worked since you
graduated more than two years ago

YORICK
No I’ve uh sorta been doing the
Kerouac thing Minus the road
trip Or traveling Or leaving my
apartment at all really I’ve
been thinking Mostly thinking

FEMALE EXECUTIVE
Mr Brown

YORICK
Yorick Please Mr Brown is my
father My grandfather actually
Professor Brown is my old man He--

FEMALE EXECUTIVE
Yorick Ill be honest With your
lack of publishing experience I
never even would have given you an
interview if Congresswoman Brown
hadn’t asked me personally

YORICK
My my mom called you

FEMALE EXECUTIVE
I’m sorry son You’re a good kid
but you’re still a kid
Push in on Yorick not quite ready to give up

AGENT 355 (VO)
The President is a bitch

INT DOLL FACTORY - MORNING

It’s after hours inside a dimly lit DOLL FACTORY that’s
cluttered with unassembled plastic body parts of girls’ toys
Standing under a naked bulb in this warehouse-sized room is
AGENT 355 a late-twenties African-American woman who could
kill you with a single dreadlock

AGENT 355
If you want him dead I’m your man

Pull out as we reveal that Agent 355 is speaking with two
men a seated RUSSIAN BUSINESSMAN and the nervous ASSISTANT
standing behind him

BUSINESSMAN
And yet you’re not I am paying
for an assassin not a--

ASSISTANT
The woman comes very highly
recommended sir She took down
the head of Roberto Oil In
Venezuela

355 smiles

AGENT 355
Haven’t you heard We’re the
deadlier of the species If Mother
Russia could hold onto her brides
better maybe you wouldn’t have to
outsource all your dirty work

The frowning Russian businessman just stares at 355 but
his grimace eventually gives way to a smile

BUSINESSMAN
You remind me of my first wife

AGENT 355
Messy divorce

BUSINESSMAN
I cut her face off and had it
stretched into a lampshade

AGENT 355
(ignoring this)
Give me the first ten million now
and POTUS will be dead before he
leaves his stupid ranch

The businessman motions to his assistant who brings 355 a
SUITCASE Just as he’s about to hand over this case 355
GRABS the assistant’s wrist and TWISTS it behind his back
With her free hand 355 pulls out a GLOCK which she presses
to her startled hostage’s head
AGENT 355
Federal agent You’re both under
arrest

BUSINESSMAN

Which federal agency

AGENT 355
Youre not really in a position to
be asking questions fuckface

The businessman calmly raises a finger and GUNSHOTS ring out
as the hostage’s chest suddenly EXPLODES The dead assistant
slumps to the ground as SEVERAL HEAVILY ARMED RUSSIAN
BRUISERS step out of the shadows behind their boss

BUSINESSMAN
Hurt her as much as you want but I
get to finish it

355’s eyes narrow as she uses her free hand to pull out a
BALLISTIC BATON which she EXTENDS with a satisfying THINK

The first of the six thugs RUNS at 355 and she promptly
SHOOTS him in the chest knocking him to the ground

The next uses his muscular forearm to CHOP the Glock out of
355’s hand but she SWINGS her metal baton right into one of
his eye sockets

As this blinded man screams in pain two more charge at 355
She GRABS the first by his thick neck and SNAPS it by using
his skull as a fulcrum to SWING around and KICK his partner
in the face with devastating force

355 continues to throw punches and break bones until she’s
eventually overpowered by Russian muscle As the men wrestle
her to the ground 355 looks up to see the businessman
holding one of his goons’ machine guns

BUSINESSMAN
I’m going to enjoy reading by the
light of your face

And with that he SMASHES her in the skull with the butt of
the weapon knocking her unconscious

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

A dejected Yorick shambles towards his rundown brownstone in

Queens as an AIRPLANE roars directly overhead He lives
right next door to LaGuardia Airport What a nightmare

INT APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUING

As Yorick forces open the sticky front door he’s greeted by
his very PREGNANT NEIGHBOR who’s retrieving her mail

NEIGHBOR
Howd it go Yorick

YORICK
Better than the last three

NEIGHBOR
Well you’ll get it next time

Yorick looks at her belly

YORICK
You know yet or you want it to be a
surprise

NEIGHBOR

Oh we just found out Little boy

YORICK
Seriously Congrats that’s so--

The two are immediately interrupted by their TRANSVESTITE
LANDLORD a man trying (unconvincingly) to pass as a woman
She angrily slings open the door to hisher ground floor
apartment

TRANSVESTITE LANDLORD
Something in your apartment smells
like shit

YORICK
Oh Yeah Sorry I I think I
burnt popcorn last--

TRANSVESTITE LANDLORD
It’s literally shit Yorick The
lease says no animals

Yorick quickly gathers his bills and trudges up the stairs

YORICK
(under his breath)
No it says no cats or dogs

Yorick pushes into his dark pad a hilariously tiny studio
apartment decorated with posters of HOUDINI and other
assorted nerdery
YORICK
Ampersand Amp Where are you
buddy Your questionable hygiene
has run its course little man
Time for--

Yorick who screams like a girl

This question belongs to COLONEL ALTER TSE’ELON a thirty-

holding a large MACHINE GUN and smoking casually as are her

SOLDIERS several of whom also happen to be female

Pull out to reveal that Alter is addressing an AMERICAN
TELEVISION REPORTER and his CAMERAMAN

REPORTER
We’re Americans

ALTER
I never would have guessed

ALTER is joined by her second-in-command an attractive young
Israeli female soldier named RACHEL

RACHEL
They’re doing a piece on female
combat soldiers Alter

ALTER
They’re not doing anything until
our patrol is finished

Suddenly GUNSHOTS ring out The reporter and his cameraman
flinch but the Israeli soldiers just casually toss their
cigarettes aside

REPORTER
Are are they shooting at us um
Alter
ALTER
My name is Colonel Tse’elon and
you will address me as such Come
my team and I will get you to
safety

The reporter subtly signals for his cameraman to keep
filming as Alter escorts the crew double-time through the
dark streets

REPORTER
So how did you--

ALTER
Twenty-one months of military
service is compulsory for all
Israeli women

REPORTER
Yeah but this is sort of a new
phenomenon right Women on the
front lines

ALTER
My grandmother crossed into enemy
territory during our War of
Independence and her grandmother
was part of the all-female
Battalion of Death during the
Russian Revolution

Alter stops and turns to speak directly into the
videographer’s camera

ALTER
Defending our territory at any cost
is in women’s blood as the new
crop of girls strapping on bomb
belts for Islamic Jihad will be
happy to--

Without warning a nearby car EXPLODES in a deafening burst
of sound and fury KNOCKING everyone to the ground

INT YORICK’S APARTMENT - MORNING

Matching this flash a frightened Yorick flips on his LIGHT
SWITCH illuminating an unexpected vision standing before
him a 20-something blonde bombshell named BETH DEVILLE much
too beautiful for a geek like Yorick or is she Beth’s
wearing a TRENCHCOAT that’s closed tight over her thin body
YORICK
Beth

BETH
Hey handsome

YORICK
I thought you weren’t coming over
for another--

She kisses him

BETH
You talk too much

Yorick smiles as he looks down at her coat

YORICK
What’s with the trench You’re
flying to sunny Los Angeles not
old-timey London

BETH
I’m insulted This is what I wore
to our first date remember
Midnight screening of Miller’s
Crossing at the Angelika You said
I looked like a degenerate flasher

YORICK
That wasn’t our date You were
still seeing my troglodyte of a
roommate

BETH
So you were seeing Libby

YORICK
You guys set me up with her And
she covered her eyes every time
someone in the movie got shot

BETH
Well my date kept falling asleep

YORICK

(pulling Beth close)
But right after the Danny Boy
scene when Leo blew that guy’s
brains out and stole his tommy gun
you turned to me and whispered
“That was the coolest motherfucking
thing I’ve ever seen”

He kisses her

YORICK
And that’s when I knew you were the
only degenerate flasher I would
ever love

BETH
And that’s when I knew I needed a
better wardrobe

Beth undoes her trenchcoat revealing skimpy LINGERIE
underneath Yorick is predictably awestruck

YORICK
Wow I mean that is--

BETH
Shh It’s a going-away present

YORICK
But I’m not the one leaving
town unless those pharmaceutical
nerds want you so bad they’ve
thrown in an extra ticket

Beth sighs They’ve obviously had this conversation before
BETH
My internship’s only for three
months Yorick
YORICK
Sure until you discover the cure

for cancer and they offer you--

Fed up Beth PUSHES Yorick to the floor and climbs on top of
him

BETH
Do you have protection

Yorick fumbles for a nearby box He tips it over and out
spills DUCT TAPE a GASMASK and various CANNED GOODS

YORICK
Do you have anthrax

Beth kisses him

BETH
It’s fine

She starts grinding against him

YORICK
Are are you sure that’s safe

BETH
Yeah I’m on the shot

Yorick kisses her back but stops abruptly

YORICK
Wait what shot

Beth smiles

BETH
The one I invented

What the hell are you talking
about

INT CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

Standing outside of a large convention center ballroom is
VICTORIA a conservatively dressed redhead in her late
thirties She’s arguing with a REGISTRATION OFFICIAL while
dozens of MALE GRANDMASTERS play chess behind him

VICTORIA
I registered months ago

REGISTRATION OFFICIAL
I’m sorry Mrs--

VICTORIA
It’s Ms If they didn’t put it
under my last name try Victoria

REGISTRATION OFFICIAL

VICTORIA

Two MEN IN BLUE BLAZERS rush over to remove Victoria

VICTORIA
I’m a grandmaster I could beat
any man in that room

The security officers GRAB Victoria but she shakes them off
and steps away from the registration table On her way out
of the center she looks back and threatens

VICTORIA
There’s a reason the queen is the
most powerful piece you know

INT YORICK’S APARTMENT - DAY

Back in his pad a post-coital Yorick is in bed now lying
next to a disrobed Beth

YORICK
Was that okay

Beth smiles as she runs her fingers over his chest

BETH
Which part of “faster harder
again” confused you

YORICK
No I mean about me finishing um
inside you

Beth rolls over a little hurt

BETH
Yorick this is what got me my
stupid scholarship

(MORE)

BETH (contd)
The hormones I synthesized are just
as effective as the pill

YORICK
Then why not just take that

BETH
Because if it weren’t for
researches being brave enough to
test shit on themselves wed still
have malaria and anemia and a
million other diseases

YORICK
You don’t have a disease Beth
(a nervous beat)
Do you

Beth stands covering herself in a blanket

BETH
Baby you have no idea what it’s
like to bleed for days on end But
the science exists for women to
permanently suppress ovulation to
get rid of the monthly visitor
forever

YORICK
I thought you were the one girl who
didn’t mind the sight of blood

BETH
(a little melancholy)
Yeah well people change I
guess

YORICK
As long as you’re sure it you
know works

INT LABORATORY - MORNING

Inside a hi-tech facility a RAT hisses in pain as it’s
injected with a long syringe

Pull out to reveal that we’re in a laboratory FILLED with
CAGED LAB ANIMALS (mice baboons etc) The scientist
behind this experiment is DR ALLISON MANN a stoic Chinese-
American woman in her early thirties

DR MANN
Easy girl It only hurts the
first time

VISITOR (0S)
Yeah I’ve used that line a few
times myself

Mann turns to see her VISITOR an intimidating man wearing
the kind of standard-issue black suit that suggests you’re
about to be killed or audited or both

DR MANN
Then here’s a new one for you “No
means no” I’ve told you a hundred

times I’m not interested in
helping you

VISITOR
Dr Mann China is dangerously
close to becoming a peer competitor
to the United States and unless we
can slow the growth of its
strategic arsenal--

DR MANN
Why are you people coming to me
Im Chinese

VISITOR
No youre Chinese-American and if
you had any love for your heritage
or the family you left behind Dr
Ming you wouldn’t have taken your
new name from a faux-Oriental movie
theater in LA

DR MANN
(coldly)
I was eighteen when I did that

VISITOR
Doctor your country needs you

DR MANN
I’m interested in creating life
not destroying it

VISITOR
Yeah but your work isn’t cheap is
it It’d be a shame if your
funding suddenly expired

Mann stops what she’s doing

DR MANN
Are you threatening me

VISITOR
Look Allison we’re not interested
in hurting anyone Were just
looking for ways to alter the
geopolitical landscape if and when
push comes to shove with the
People’s Republic

DR MANN
Whatever along with being junk
science your plan is a grotesque
violation of the natural order

VISITOR
And animal cloning isn’t

DR MANN
Every twin on the planet is a
“clone” There’s a precedent
What you’re suggesting is
impossible

The Visitor tosses a classified file folder onto Mann’s desk
Its labelled “SETTING SON PRIMATE RESEARCH PROPOSAL”

VISITOR
Well see

DR MANN
What is this

VISITOR
The first step Call me if you
want to be there for the second

Before exiting the lab the Visitor taps on one of the
sleeping baboon’s glass prisons causing the frothing animal
to SPRING to life

INT YORICK’S APARTMENT - DAY

capuchin HELPER MONKEY off of her shoulder

BETH

with his finger)
You know that curly symbol for
“and” like in Turner and Hooch or--

As the diaper-clad monkey BITES Beth’s finger Yorick reaches
out to take the animal

YORICK
I’m so sorry He’s supposed to be
a helper monkey

BETH
Please don’t tell me you’ve gotten
that lazy

YORICK

It’s not for me I volunteered to
train this feces-slinging bastard
to help quadriplegics with their
daily chores and shit I wanted to
have him ready before you left but
he got stuck in customs after some
kind of paperwork screw-up so--

BETH
Yorick you couldn’t keep sea
monkeys alive Why would you do
that

Beth walks into the tiny bathroom to wash her wound closing
the door behind her and leaving Yorick alone with his pet

YORICK
I don’t know I guess I just
wanted to use my abundant free time
to help people I mean you and
the rest of my globetrotting pals
are off saving the world or
whatever and I haven’t done a
goddamn thing for anyone

BETH (0S)
Yorick look Before I go
there’s there’s something I need
to tell you

Yorick pulls a tiny BOX out of a nearby drawer and looks
down at the little cube thoughtfully

YORICK
Wait me first I’ve been meaning
to say this for a long time

He opens the box revealing a modest ENGAGEMENT RING As he
speaks Beth runs the water in the bathroom just barely
drowning out his quiet voice

YORICK
Beth you’re brilliant and sexy and
you know the names of all six and
half of the Three Stooges I
didn’t even know they made women
like you I want to spend--

Yorick nervously SHUTS the little ring box as Beth steps out
of the bathroom now wearing conservative attire

BETH
I should really go baby

Before Yorick can protest she kisses him deeply

BETH

I’1l1 call you every day okay
YORICK

Wait um can I at least carry your

bags

Beth reaches out to pet Ampersand with her newly bandaged
finger

BETH
You should probably stay here and
take care of Chim Chim huh
Besides it’s not like I have very
far to walk

On cue the windows in Yorick’s apartment begin to RATTLE as
a passenger jet THUNDERS directly overhead

A dejected Yorick watches Beth leave as Ampersand picks
something out of his hair

old woman wearing the odd combination of fashionably tight
attire and heavy-duty work gloves

SUPERMODEL
Oh my god Lady are you okay
YORICK
(muffled by gasmask)
I I’m fine
SUPERMODEL
You sure What’s wrong with your
voice
YORICK
Just got the wind knocked out of
me
SUPERMODEL

I am so sorry I just started
driving this thing and I still
suck at braking Doesn’t exactly
handle like my old Miata you know
I should probably

The Supermodel walks around to the back of her garbage truck
and reacts with disappointment

SUPERMODEL
Aw shit

YORICK
What

SUPERMODEL

They fell out

Cut to the back of the truck where several BADLY DECOMPOSED
MALE CORPSES have fallen out of the vehicle

YORICK
Oh Christ They’re they’re
all

SUPERMODEL

Yep all mine But if you gimme a
quick hand with these dudes I
might consider sharing the profits

YORICK
This this is your job

SUPERMODEL
I know right It’s been more than
a month and there are still a ton
of single dudes rotting in their
apartments

She starts dragging one of the lighter corpses

SUPERMODEL
Everyone’s worried about diseases
and shit so the CDC pays me a can
of food for every corpse I bring
in Only work I could find
Fucked up huh

Yorick picks up his ANIMAL CARRIER and looks inside to make
sure its occupant is still safe A little MONKEY’S PAW
reaches out before Yorick pushes it back in

SUPERMODEL
I used to have a modeling contract
with Wilhelmina and now I’ma
goddamn garbage girl Worst part
is I spent three grand on my boobs
two days before the Plague hit
Fat lot of good our tits do us now

YORICK
What do you do with these bodies

SUPERMODEL
I take ‘em over to RFK No one’s
using the stadium anymore so they
turned it into one of those
whatchamacallits Crematoriums

Yorick tries not to puke

SUPERMODEL
You all right Take a few deep
breaths You don’t have to wear
that mask anymore you know If
whatever wiped them out could’ve
hurt us we’d be dead already

The masked figure turns and walks away from the confused
model leaving her alone with her work

YORICK
Yeah well better safe than sorry
EXT LARGE HOUSE - NIGHT
Later that evening the masked figure arrives at an expensive
home completely unlit thanks to the lack of electricity
INT LARGE HOUSE - CONTINUING

Yorick pushes his way inside the dark foyer He finally
takes off his mask revealing a few days worth of stubble

YORICK
Hello Is anybody--

Without warning a figure steps out of the shadows and CLOCKS
Yorick in the head with a heavy MAG FLASHLIGHT

YORICK
Ow Son of a bitch

Yorick rubs his head as he turns to see the woman we’1ll soon
learn is his MOTHER Congresswoman Jennifer Brown

YORICK
Literally I guess

The woman turns on the flashlight to get a better look at the
young man she just struck

CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
Yorick Is is that you

YORICK
Hi mom

The congresswoman DROPS her flashlight and EMBRACES her son

CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
I prayed every second Yorick I
prayed every second for you but I
never thought--

YORICK
I’m sorry It took me weeks just
to get out of New York

Yorick’s mother begins to WEEP tears of joy She hugs him
again stroking his hair so hard she’s almost pulling it out

CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
Tell me this is real Please I
can’t live through another goddamn
dream like this Yorick I can’t--

YORICK
It’s real I checked on all my
friends David and Jeff and Dan
and Jay and--

CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
And are you

YORICK
The only one I think so Unless
dad I mean is daddy still

Congresswoman Brown wipes away her tears and gives her son a
look that clearly says “No”

YORICK
Damn Goddamn it GODDAMN IT

Yorick PUNCHES a wall as hard as he can

He collapses to the floor taking a seat next to his pet
carrier Yorick dries his eyes with the back of a sleeve

YORICK
I I thought maybe it was
hereditary I thought whatever
kept me alive might have--

Suddenly the door to the pet carrier SPRINGS open and
Ampersand comes SCURRYING out Yorick’s mom reacts the same
way everybody does to this animal

CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
Jesus What the hell is that

YORICK
His name’s Ampersand I’m training
him to be a helper monkey I was

anyway

CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
Him But the NSA says every male
mammal--

YORICK
I don’t know but whatever kept me
alive must have also shielded this

guy

CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
Or maybe that animal is carrying
something that shielded you from
whatever killed all the other men

YORICK
Huh Guess I hadn’t considered
that

Yorick’s mom subtly shakes her head She loves this kid but
he clearly hasn’t thought through his situation

YORICK
Whatever I’m all alone

CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
(squeezing his hand)
We don’t know that honey boy
Have you talked with Beth

YORICK
No she was in a plane when
everything went down and and

there are pieces of 747s strewn
everywhere I mean what
percentage of pilots were women
Four Five

CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
Yorick There’s something you
should hear
INT STUDY - NIGHT

Cut inside the study of the late Professor Brown where

Yorick’s mom is playing a message from the family answering

machine

Ampersand is sitting on Yorick’s shoulder

FROM MACHINE
You have one saved message

YORICK
Wait your phone still works

CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
If there’s an operator on duty
Now quiet My generator doesn’t
have much juice left

FROM MACHINE
Mrs Brown I’m I’m sorry to
bother you

YORICK
(relieved)
Beth

FROM MACHINE
I I don’t know what’s going on
back on the East Coast but I just
lived through an emergency landing
and I’m on my way to LA I can’t
get a hold of your son but if he’s
still if he’s still around I’m
sure he’ll come to you first
Please tell him -beep-

Congresswoman Brown turns off the machine

YORICK
I’m going to her

CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
Don’t be absurd Yorick

YORICK
She needs me

CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
And we’1l find someone to bring her
to you but you’re potentially this
country’s--this world’s--most
valuable resource

(MORE )
CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN (contd)
The rest of the government has to
know about you so we can decide
what to do next

YORICK
What rest of the government mom
I mean who’s even in charge here

CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
President Rice

YORICK
(Were fucked”)
Condi

CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
I don’t want to hear any of that
misogynist bullshit from you kid
Other countries didn’t collapse
under Thatcher or Indira or or
Mier and we’re going to hold it
together too

YORICK
Yeah but what about Congress
Aren’t like 90 of you dead
You’re the one who always
complained that fucking Burundi had
more female politicians than us

CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
And you might be able to help us
change that

YORICK
How by locking me in the Oval
Office so I can be aa stud for
however many women you want me to
inseminate

CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
I have no intention of whoring out
my own son Yorick But you need
to be somewhere safe

Yorick’s mom gently pushes her son (and his animal) outside

the study

Before closing the door

CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
Now go upstairs get some sleep
Well figure out the rest of this
in the morning

she tries to reassure Yorick

CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
Everything’s going to be all right
kid I love you

Alone now Yorick turns to look at his empty house

INT YORICK’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - NIGHT

Upstairs Yorick carries his monkey into his boyhood room
which is lit only by what moonlight streams inside

Yorick notices a few boxes labelled “NYU” leftover memories
from his last year at college He opens one of these
cardboard containers and pulls out an UNFRAMED PHOTOGRAPH
It’s a picture of him with Beth at a college Halloween party
Yorick is wearing a STRAITJACKET and Beth is dressed in the
top hat and fishnet stockings of a MAGICIAN’S ASSISTANT

Beth is holding up bunny ears behind the laughing Yorick

He flips the picture over and scribbled on the back is a
hand-written note from Beth that reads “YORICK BROWN BETH
DEVILLE DRUNKEN MAGIC FOREVER”

Yorick smiles but his happiness fades as he thinks of how
far away his best friend is He clutches the photo against
his chest falls back into his old bed and closes his eyes

INT YORICK’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Smash cut to a few hours later for this image of a sleeping
Yorick as his eyes suddenly SPRING OPEN We can hear people
ARGUING off-screen

A nervous Yorick quietly opens his bedroom door to look down
at the verbal fight transpiring in the foyer just below

INT FOYER - CONTINUING

Downstairs Yorick’s mother is yelling at TWO ATHLETIC-
LOOKING FEMALE SECRET SERVICE AGENTS

CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
This wasnt part of our deal You
told me you were just going to
escort him to the White House

SECRET SERVICE AGENT 1
I’m sorry ma’am There just
aren’t enough Secret Service agents
left to guarantee his safety there

CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
Then where are you taking him

SECRET SERVICE AGENT 2
To a classified location

CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN
Like fuck you are This is my
child I’m not going to let you
kidnap him

SECRET SERVICE AGENT 1
Ma’am please lower your voice
This is above all our heads so

Just then the Secret Service agent looks upstairs and
catches a glimpse of Yorick in his bedroom doorway He
immediately SLAMS the door shut

SECRET SERVICE AGENT 2
(to her partner)
Take him

INT YORICK’S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - CONTINUING

Panicking Yorick THROWS on his backpack and STUFFS Ampersand
inside his carrier His mom’s voice can be heard off-screen
as can the heavy footsteps of the rapidly approaching agents

CONGRESSWOMAN BROWN (0S)
Yorick I’m sorry I’m so sorry

Yorick starts to climb out his second-story window but
before he does he reaches back and grabs the photo of BETH

The two Secret Service agents soon KICK OPEN his flimsily
locked door but Yorick has already disappeared

EXT BACKYARD - CONTINUING

DROPPING to a concrete patio Yorick (still carrying
Ampersand’s case) LANDS awkwardly and stumbles to his feet

He races for the side of his house where he finds a large
shape covered by a white sheet Yorick yanks it off
revealing an old HARLEY MOTORCYCLE Frantically he starts
tipping over lawn equipment and nearby bags of plant food
looking for its KEYS

YORICK
(quietly)
Come on dad a little help here

Finally Yorick cracks open a can of paint grabs the hidden
treasure inside and JAMS the key into the bike’s ignition
It roars to life just as the two SS agents storm outside

The women GRAB for Yorick (who’s riding the bike while
carrying Amp’s case on his lap) but he deftly out-maneuvers
them and RACES out into the night

EXT STREETS OF WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT

Later that evening Yorick (again wearing his hood and
gasmask) WEAVES through the cluttered DC intersections on
his father’s old motorcycle Ampersand’s carrier is now tied
onto the back of the bike

Confident that he’s no longer being followed he stops at a
makeshift roadblock to catch his breath and find his
bearings

Suddenly Yorick hears the sound of SINGING He turns to see
a FUNERAL PROCESSION hundreds of women marching down the
street carrying candles flowers and mementos of their fallen
brothers husbands and sons

In the middle of the crowd Yorick spots someone else wearing
a GASMASK Could this be another male in disguise Yorick
slows his bike next to this masked figure

YORICK
Excuse me You’re not a are you
a

The figure pulls off the mask revealing a weathered forty-
something rocker chick This is HEATHER

HEATHER
I know you sweetie

YORICK
Oh I I saw the mask and I
thought maybe you were I thought
maybe you were someone I knew

HEATHER
Sorry just got so used to wearing
this thing it’s kinda become my
security blanket I’m Heather by
the by

She holds out her hand for Yorick to shake

YORICK
I’m Beth Where are you guys
headed

HEATHER

Oh they turned one of the
monuments into a kinda memorial for
all the men

YORICK
Which monument

HEATHER
Guess

Heather points up at the nearby WASHINGTON MONUMENT looking
particularly phallic in the moonlight

YORICK
(under his breath)
Always about size with you ladies
isn’t it

Just then Yorick hears the rumble of MORE motorcycles as he
turns to see a gang of several DAUGHTERS OF THE AMAZON circle
this ad hoc shrine to men

These post-apocalyptic survivalists have RIFLES and other
weapons slung over their backs and numerous MEN’S NECKTIES
attached to their belts like freshly shorn scalps Two of
these women are wearing full-face HELMETS

YORICK
The hell

HEATHER
Daughters of the Amazon

YORICK
I’ve only heard rumors They’re
like roving packs of pissed-off
lesbians right

HEATHER
They’re not gay they’re crazy
Been burning down all the sperm
banks

YORICK
Why

HEATHER
Who knows Some girls will do any
stupid shit to get into a gang
long as it means food and
protection

Push in on the bikers as one of the helmeted women (the
apparent leader) removes her helmet to address the crowd of
mourners It’s the female chess grandmaster VICTORIA

VICTORIA
Sisters why do you continue to
worship at the altar of the
patriarchy The gendercide is
cause for celebration It rid the
planet of rapists and dictators and
serial killers The Y chromosome
was an genetic aberration one that
the planet rightly expunged

As the largely frightened crowd scatters Victoria spots the
disguised Yorick in the background She turns to two of her
underlings THERESA (a young woman with a completely shaved
head) and CATHERINE (the other helmeted Amazon)

VICTORIA
Theresa Catherine a pound of
Godiva to whoever brings me that
woman’s bike

While the rest of the Daughters of the Amazon begin attaching
some kind of ELECTRONIC DEVICE to the base of the Washington
Monument Catherine and Theresa hop on their bikes and speed
towards Yorick

YORICK
Oh Oh crap

Yorick squeezes the throttle and his bike JUMPS to life He
squeals past a bewildered Heather with the two Amazons in
hot pursuit Zooming down a side street and away from the
crowds Yorick does his best to out-race his two pursuers
but Theresa (the bald one) pulls out a handgun and FIRES at
Yorick’s back tire causing his bike to LOSE CONTROL and
SPARK to a painful halt on its chromed side

Ampersand WHINES from inside his carrier as Yorick pulls
himself out from under the bike

YORICK
(groggy to Ampersand)
Well how do you think I feel

Yorick looks up to see the two Daughters of the Amazon
standing over him Theresa has her gun trained on his face

THERESA
Ill take the mask too whore

YORICK
I’m sorry I I can’t

The helmeted rider begs Yorick to be sensible

CATHERINE
Just do what she says lady

Reluctantly Yorick peels off the gasmask and the two women
react with appropriate shock and awe to his stubbled face

THERESA
You’re you’re

Yorick stands and puts on his best female impersonator voice

YORICK
(terrible female
impersonation)
It’s just glandular okay

THERESA
You have an Adams apple

Theresa steps forward and puts a HAND down the front of
Yorick’s PANTS

YORICK
Hey What are you--
THERESA
He’s a man but just barely

Yorick pulls away offended

YORICK
What are you going to do rape me

THERESA
Don’t flatter yourself I’m taking
you to my boss

CATHERINE (0S)
No You’re not

Theresa turns to see Catherines gun in her face

THERESA
Jesus Catherine we can split the
fucking chocolate

“Catherine” finally removes her helmet revealing that she’s
actually AGENT 355

AGENT 355
My name’s not Catherine

THERESA
What are you talking about I’ve
been bunking with you for a week
You’ re-—

Without hesitating 355 PISTOL-WHIPS Theresa instantly
knocking the girl out Yorick FLINCHES in fear as 355 aims
the gun at him but she instead fires at the front tire of
Theresa’s BIKE before jumping back on her own motorcycle

AGENT 355
(to Yorick)
Hop on
YORICK

Like hell Warrior Princess

AGENT 355
I’m not an Amazon I’m an agent of
the Culper Ring

Yorick picks up his carrier to make sure that Ampersand is
safe

YORICK
The what

AGENT 355
Forget it We should go before the
fireworks begin

YORICK
What fireworks

Suddenly a deafening EXPLOSION is heard and Yorick turns
just in time to watch the Washington Monument TOPPLE on its
side felled like a marbled redwood

As the dust from the demolition spreads their way Yorick
matter-of-factly climbs onto 355’s bike

YORICK
Right And away we go
INT TEL AVIV COMMAND CENTER - MORNING

Cut to an Israeli war room where countless YOUNG FEMALE
CADETS man phone banks and computer screens Rachel is
looking up at a BIG MAP of the Middle East with her

commander Alter This display shows heavy TROOP MOVEMENTS

out of Israel and into Lebanon Syria and Egypt

Suddenly a young girl wearing headphones
her listening station

RACHEL
When does it end

ALTER
When our people are safe

RACHEL
Our people are safe Alter
thanks to you But we no longer
have their support The women want
security not world domination

ALTER
Security must be earned Rachel

RACHEL
It was already given to us when the
boys died Israel has more combat-
ready soldiers than any nation on
the planet now and you know it
You have every teenage girl in Tel
Aviv eavesdropping on 192 badly
fractured governments and unless
the three girls on board that
Australian submarine decide to
invade the Mediterranean there are
no more threats to us We’re--

RADIO GIRL
Lieutenant-General Tse’elon I
have something

Alter gives Rachel a knowing look

ALTER
(to the Radio Girl)
On speaker soldier

calls Alter over to

Over the tinny speaker the voice of one of the female SECRET
SERVICE AGENTS is heard

FROM SPEAKER
I have not been drinking Madame
President Congresswoman Brown’s
son is alive and now he’s
somewhere out there We--

RACHEL
Another delusional crackpot

ALTER
Perhaps but all it would take is
our enemies finding a single boy
for them to resurrect their entire
armies

RACHEL
What You’re not seriously
considering wasting resources on
some wild goose chase are you

Alter shoots Rachel daggers before pulling the young woman
aside to quietly lecture her

ALTER
You’re welcome to question me
Colonel but never in front of my
troops I’m your friend but I’m
also your superior

RACHEL
You may have asked for this career
Lieutenant-General but I’m just a
lowly film student serving her time
in your “stop gap”

ALTER
So what you want to make bullshit
romantic comedies to sedate the
helpless widows
Rachel looks up at the big map with a hint of sadness

ALTER
Or do you want to save the world
EXT INTERSTATE - NIGHT

The motorcycle that 355 and Yorick are riding slows to a halt
next to a pickup truck The two dismount

AGENT 355
You ever siphoned before

YORICK
Kind of a personal question don’t
you think Mind if I ask your name
before I start spilling my sexual
history

355 pulls out a small length of rubber hose and goes to work
transferring fuel from the truck to her motorcycle

AGENT 355
You can call me 355

YORICK
“Three Fifty-five” What is that
some kind of double-oh-seven thing

AGENT 355
It’s classified

Hearing that word again Yorick suddenly grows nervous
YORICK

You’re not part of the Secret
Service are you

AGENT 355
We’re a hell of a lot more secret
than that

YORICK

What does that mean

AGENT 355
I told you I’m not allowed to

355 stops herself

AGENT 355
Fuck it What’s the point right
My bosses are all dead

Yorick actually looks a little relieved to hear this

YORICK
Oh that’s cool I mean it’s not
cool but I was worried you were--

AGENT 355
355 was the codename assigned to
this country’s first female spy
She was part of General
Washington’s Culper Ring during the
Revolutionary War

YORICK
So you’re what one of those re-
enactors

AGENT 355
You wouldnt have learned this in
AP History but Washington never
disbanded the Culper Ring For
more than 200 years we’ve been
secretly working to protect the men
and women of this country

Yorick looks at a CORPSE inside one of the nearby vehicles

YORICK
Youre doing a bang-up job

355 spits out gasoline

AGENT 355
What’s your story
YORICK
So far A pretty crappy mystery
AGENT 355
So you have no clue why you’re the
last guy
YORICK

Your guess is as lame as mine I’m
Yorick by the way

355 just shoots him a look “You thought my name was weird”

YORICK
My dad teaches taught drama I
guess he thought naming his kid
after an obscure Shakespeare
character would help him get
tenure

The Culper Ring agent finishes putting away her siphoning
gear

AGENT 355
Well it’s a good thing I found you
when I did You wouldn’t survive
another month out there on your
own The Amazon movement is
growing and those women would love
nothing more than killing someone
like you

YORICK
Why I mean I can see locking me
up but if those violent femmes
offed the last man wouldn’t they
sort of be insuring the death of
the fairer sex too

AGENT 355
I infiltrated their organization to
find out if they had anything to do
with whatever caused the global
Manslaughter They’re smart enough
to exploit it but I don’t think
they started it Unfortunately for
you they do have a plan to keep
humanity going

355 jumps back on the refueled bike

AGENT 355
And it’s strictly no boys allowed

INT GEORGETOWN LECTURE HALL - NIGHT

Having finished their work at the Washington Monument the

Daughters of the Amazon have returned to this brightly lit
peaceful lecture hall where they’re passing out free Power
Bars to the starving women funneling through the doors

On stage Victoria is addressing these new recruits while
standing next to a large projected image of a human EGG

VICTORIA
Parthenogenesis the development of
an embryo without fertilization by
amale It’s every woman’s dream
The joy of creation without having
to endure the most painful part of
childbirth marriage

A few of the hardcores laugh at this as Victoria changes the
slide to an image of DR MANN

VICTORIA
It’s no longer science fiction
thanks to the pioneering work of
this woman bioengineer Dr Allison
Mann By injecting a single cell
into one egg she could help us
give birth to our own twins

(MORE)

VICTORIA (contd)
Can you imagine a society of
daughters brought into this world
without the poisonous seed of man
We find this woman and the battle
of the sexes is won

THERESA (0S)
Victoria

Victoria looks out to see Theresa her bald follower The
girl KNEELS as she enters the room

VICTORIA
Off your knees Theresa You know
were all equals here

Dutifully Theresa rises

VICTORIA
What happened out there Are you
all right

THERESA
You have to put out a dragnet
Victoria I saw one I I sawa

Close on Victoria suspicious but not disbelieving

EXT BALTIMORE SHIPPING YARDS - DAWN

Early the next morning 355 walks her empty motorcycle along
a dirt road A gasmask-clad Yorick is strolling beside her
with Ampersand on his shoulder

YORICK
So you’re going to Frisco to find
this doctor before Mad Maxine does

AGENT 355
That’s the plan Hopefully Dr
Mann will be able to tell us why
you and your animal survived too

Yorick grows nervous

YORICK
Um actually I kinda have a prior
engagement So to speak
Ampersand and I are headed to Los
Angeles to find Beth

AGENT 355
Who the hell is that

YORICK
A woman I trust more than my own
mother These days anyway

AGENT 355
Yorick you have a responsibility
We can look for your girlfriend
after we see if there’s anything
you can do for the human race

YORICK
I appreciate the offer Three but
I’m not looking for a chaperone I
handled myself just fine out there
before you came into the--

AGENT 355
Quiet

Ampersand loudly EEKS as 355 points at a grizzly sight up

ahead THREE SNARLING WOLVES gnawing on the REMAINS of a male

corpse

As the growling animals approach them a frightened Yorick

casually STEPS BEHIND 355

wolves with a WARNING SHOT fired above their heads

A grateful Yorick suddenly looks a little more amenable to
the idea of a travelling partner

YORICK
Okay let’s say I did opt to come
with you How are you getting to
Cali

AGENT 355
First I have to sell our bike
The Plague hit at rush hour out
west so the highways will be too
congested with dead guys even for
a motorcycle

YORICK
But commercial aircraft have all
gone the way of boy bands How are
we getting cross country

AGENT 355
The old-fashioned way

She quickly dispatches the killer

355 and Yorick finally reach a TRAIN YARD where hundreds of
American women are lined up like REFUGEES vying for a spot
on board an impossibly long DIESEL TRAIN

AGENT 355
Girls have been trading tampons and
vibrator batteries for seats in
first class but these wheels
should buy us some room in cargo

The masked Yorick stares at this overgrown train set unable
to hide his boyish enthusiasm

YORICK
Cool

Push into the bustling crowd where a FEMALE SCOUT clearly
dressed in the garb of the Amazons subtly watches Yorick and
355’s every move

EXT DIESEL TRAIN - NIGHT

Later that evening the packed DIESEL TRAIN chugs out of
Maryland The landscape is peppered with LARGE PIECES OF
WRECKAGE from the various passenger jets that crashed in the
minutes following the Plague

INT FREIGHT CAR - CONTINUING

Push inside a freight car which is filled with boxes of
CARGO but only two passengers 355 and an unmasked Yorick
The duo is quietly eating out of cans Yorick is feeding
most of his share to Ampersand

YORICK
I’ve eaten so many canned peaches
over the last few months I think I
shat a cobbler last night

Disgusted 355 sets down her food
Yorick checks out the car’s sparse interior
YORICK
So we’re gonna have to sleep in
this thing huh Hobo-tastic
AGENT 355

Sorry I couldn’t get us booked in
the Four Seasons
YORICK
You know I actually stayed there
one night After the Plague right
before I left to find my mom
Slept in the presidential suite

AGENT 355
Why

YORICK
Because I could I guess It was
mostly sad though The whole place
was packed with homeless women and
they didn’t exactly seem
distraught about the turn of
events you know Made me wonder
if this whole thing happened for a
reason “And the meek shall
inherit the earth” and all that

355 glares at him half-joking

AGENT 355
Who’re you calling meek

Ignoring this Yorick stands and looks out the car’s open
door at the unlit scenery passing by

YORICK
Man I have no idea where we’re at
now All these towns look the same
in the dark Is it that hard for
you ladies to turn some lights on

AGENT 355
Electricity doesn’t come through
the sockets magically Yorick It
takes a lot of manpower human-
power to operate all of the plants
and substations Energy was a male-
dominated industry but other
Culper Ring agents are out there
trying to fill the void

YORICK
So you weren’t you the only girl in
your club

AGENT 355

Men held administrative positions
but the Culpers’ undercover agents
were all women

YORICK
Why go the Charlie’s Angels route

355 stands to stretch her legs

AGENT 355
Because men can think with their
brains or with their penises but
not with both We have better
relationships with our bodies
makes us stronger in the field

YORICK
Sure as long as that field doesn’t
contain Mike Tyson

AGENT 355
Were not always as physically
powerful but there’s a reason the
best rock climbers are women
Weve got you beat in flexibility
agility problem-solving

YORICK
Yeah yeah I’ve seen this sitcom
You’re all great we suck at
everything

AGENT 355
Not everything You ever been to a
nursing home Notice how it’s
ninety percent old women Same
with suicide We might attempt it
more but you guys usually succeed

YORICK
So what you’re saying the one
thing men are better at than
women is dying
355 looks out at the darkness
AGENT 355
Youre ahead of us so far

social security number and three
posts to his old blog He’s a
Zilch Alter If Yorick’s really
the last God didn’t exactly leave
us a Moses did he

ALTER
The fact that you still believe in
a higher power after all this is
charming

Rachel listens to something coming over her headphones

RACHEL
Scuttlebutt on the ground is that a
young man was recently spotted in
DC But unsubstantiated male
sightings are more common than
corpses these days so I continue
to question the wisdom of all this

ALTER
My gut says Yorick is alive
Rachel
RACHEL
Let’s say he is And let’s say we
abduct the Americans’ only son
You realize they’1l go to war to
get him back

ALTER
We should be so lucky

RACHEL
What does that mean

ALTER
You saw what happened at the Temple
Mount a few months ago didn’t you
Between our own people The
rioting The fistfights

RACHEL
Yeah well the ultra-orthodox
women interpret the men’s death a
little differently than the rest of
us

ALTER
The fighting didn’t begin in
earnest until the Israeli Defense
Forces sedated our Arab
neighbors As soon as we removed
all of Israel’s external threats
the internal conflict that’s been
simmering for years finally came to
a boil

The helicopter BANKS into the sun

ALTER
The same will happen to our friends
in the States soon enough Without
an outside “evil” for its citizens
to hate poor will turn against
rich white against black

RACHEL
What are you suggesting that the
only way to protect peace in our
time is to invent a war What the
hell kind of plan is that

Alter smiles a little Mona Lisa grin

ALTER
A very old very reliable one

INT FREIGHT CAR —- MORNING

Open tight on a sleeping Yorick who’s JOLTED awake as the
stopped train begins to MOVE

He bolts upright and is relieved to see 355 sitting across
from him with Ampersand on her shoulder Strangely enough
the Culper Ring agent is KNITTING

YORICK
What are you working on Rifle
cozy

AGENT 355

Just keeping my hands busy
The train quickly picks up full speed

YORICK
How long were we stopped

AGENT 355
Few hours Crew had to remove a
herd of dead cows from the tracks

YORICK
Bulls

AGENT 355
Sorry

YORICK

All cows are females Any dead
cattle were probably bulls

355 scrunches up her nose as she points at Yorick’s shirt

AGENT 355
Yeah well speaking of rotting
livestock

Yorick sniffs at himself

YORICK
Whoof Sorry I haven’t changed
my shirt since I got to Washington

AGENT 355
You want to borrow one of mine
Say what you will about the
Daughters of the Amazon but their
laundry skills are phenomenal

355 takes a fresh dress shirt out of her bag

YORICK
Third time you’ve saved my life
Three-fiddy

Yorick pulls off his dirty T-shirt and 355 can’t help but
check out his body Surprisingly the seemingly scrawny
young man actually has a pretty good build 355 quickly
looks away as Yorick starts putting on the new shirt

YORICK
Am I having a stroke or are these
buttons suddenly on the wrong side

AGENT 355
It’s a woman’s shirt Yorick Deal
with it

YORICK
Since when are your buttons on the
left

AGENT 355

Since buttons were invented Guys
used to carry swords so the left
side of his jacket had to close
over the right So he could draw
without his blade getting caught in
something

Yorick continues to stupidly fumble with his buttons and 355
comes over to help him

AGENT 355
Ladies had servants who did their
dressing for them so putting
buttons on the left made it easier
for them

YORICK
That was then huh

The two look into each other’s eyes for a moment They’re
only inches apart here

Suddenly Ampersand (sitting on a crate in the background)
interrupts this near-romantic moment with his SCREECHING

YORICK
Settle Amp What’s got you so

355’s ears perk up too Her expression is grave

AGENT 355
You hear that

YORICK
What is it

AGENT 355
The sound of a hundred women’s
cycles syncing up

EXT DIESEL TRAIN - CONTINUING

Outside the train is now being pursued by DOZENS OF
MOTORCYCLES being ridden by the heavily armed DAUGHTERS OF
THE AMAZON Victoria is in the pole position as her troops
begin to LEAP off of their bikes and BOARD the moving
freighter’s caboose like a modern-day Great Train Robbery

INT CABOOSE - CONTINUING

As Victoria and her followers climb inside this rear car’s
female PASSENGERS scream and clutch their possessions

VICTORIA
We mean you no harm sisters
Were simply here to liberate you
from the last of your oppressors

INT FREIGHT CAR - CONTINUING

355 is looking out her freight car’s open side door as the
last of the Amazons board the rear of the train She pulls
her head back inside and slides the door closed behind her

YORICK
How bad

355 pulls a SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN out of her bag and hands it to
Yorick

AGENT 355
Depends how many of these crates
have ammo in them

YORICK
We’re not going to fight them
Three

AGENT 355
No I’m gonna hold them for as long
as I can while you make a break for
the conductor Tell her to
disconnect the engine from the rest
of the cars She gives you any
trouble put that scatter gun to
her head

YORICK
But you said it yourself I can’t
make it to California on my own I
need you out there

Push in on 355 as she checks the clip of her HANDGUN

AGENT 355
This isn’t a democracy remember
Consider it payback for all the
years women weren’t allowed to
vote

YORICK (0S)
Yeah well I’m big into suffrage

355 turns to see that Yorick is aiming his shotgun at her
head

YORICK
Here’s the new plan

EXT DIESEL TRAIN - CONTINUING

The Daughters of the Amazon are making their way between cars
of the moving train Theresa (the bald Amazon) takes point
and KICKS open the small door at the rear of Yorick and 355’s
car Her fellow Amazons follow her inside but there’s
nothing here but big boxes of freight Yorick and 355 are
nowhere to be seen

The women make their way through the car quickly with
Victoria taking up the rear As her followers exit Vic
stops dead in her tracks She looks down and sees a FRESH
SLICE of canned peach on the floor of this car

She pulls out her own 357 MAGNUM and looks around finally
noticing a CRATE that’s been recently opened one large
enough for two people to hide inside of

Victoria aims her gun at this box as she quickly PRIES open
its side

Out come tumbling a dozen CANS OF PEACHES followed by a
dozen HUNGRY RATS They scurry across Victoria’s feet

VICTORIA
AHHH

Embarrassed by her less-than-brave reaction Victoria looks
around to make sure none of her women heard it Finally she
holsters her weapon and prepares to exit the car

But just then over the rumble of the tracks Victoria hears
an unfamiliar sound She looks around for its source before
finally staring up at the CEILING of the car

EXT FREIGHT CAR ROOF - CONTINUING

Cut onto this car’s ROOF where 355 and Yorick are hiding
Yorick is frantically trying to shut up Ampersand who’s
SCREECHING his little head off here

AGENT 355
Exactly who is that thing supposed
to be helping

Yorick stuffs the monkey into his backpack

YORICK
It’s not my fault He’s fucking
learning disabled or something

VICTORIA (0OS)
Men never were very good teachers

355 and Yorick spin around to see Victoria standing behind
them on this moving train A trigger-happy Yorick attempts
to load a shell into his sawed-off shotgun by FLIPPING it by
its handle Terminator 2-style but sadly as he spins it
the weapon goes FLYING out of his hand and pinwheeling over
the side of the train

YORICK
(to himself)
Son of a

355 is about to draw her weapon when Victoria warns
VICTORIA
I don’t have to kill you both you

know

355 keeps her handgun at her side but chivalrously steps IN
FRONT of a clearly grateful Yorick

AGENT 355
Yeah You do

VICTORIA
Theresa tells me you’re not who you
said you were “Catherine” That’s

fine We’re all welcome to remake
ourselves in this brave new world
But don’t tell me that you didn’t
believe what I had to say

355 listens silently

VICTORIA
I looked into your eyes I saw the
way men have hurt you It’s time
to stop protecting our abusers like
helpless battered wives We have

to step aside and let evolution
take its course

Slowly reluctantly 355 steps aside leaving Yorick exposed
not to mention confused

YORICK

Uh
Victoria again aims her gun at Yorick

VICTORIA
Thank you sister You’ll be able
to tell your granddaughters that
you were there to witness the fall
of man

AGENT 355
Truer words

All of a sudden 355 GRABS Yorick and YANKS him over the side
of the moving train with her

Pull way out as the train barrels across a LARGE BRIDGE
355 and Yorick are just tiny figures here FALLING a hundred
feet before finally SPLASHING into a river far below

Victoria watches in disbelief as Theresa and a few of her
fellow Amazons join their leader atop the train

THERESA
Victoria are you

VICTORIA
I’m I’m fine

THERESA
And the man

VICTORIA
(flatly)
History

EXT WOODED AREA - MAGIC HOUR

Cut to later that early evening as SONIA an attractive 19-
year-old vixen with tattoos and piercings carries two
buckets of water along the bank of a river

Sonia stops in her tracks when she sees AMPERSAND sitting on
top of a backpack that’s washed up against a stone She
approaches the little capuchin monkey slowly careful not to
frighten it

SONIA
Where’d you come from little guy
Guess they musta opened up the Zoos
like they opened up our

Sonia DROPS her two pails as she notices something else
that’s washed ashore It’s YORICK waterlogged and
unconscious but alive

SONIA
Thank you Jesus
INT BEDROOM - EVENING

Were looking through Yorick’s POV As he opens his eyes
a blurry figure looming over him slowly takes shape

YORICK (0S)
Beth

Rack focus to reveal that this is actually Sonia

SONIA
Who’s Beth

YORICK
Bah

Yorick sits up to find that he’s in Sonia’s messy bedroom
lying in her bed His clothes are dry now

YORICK
What is this
Ampersand

She holds

SONIA
Take it easy

YORICK
Who are you

SONIA
My name’s Sonia I I found you
With your pet

eeks over on Sonia’s dresser

SONIA
Where did you come from Yorick

YORICK
How the hell do you know my name

up Yorick’s wallet
SONIA
Your library card I didn’t even

know people still carried--

YORICK
Oh my God 355 Is she

SONIA
You mean her

Sonia points across the hall through the open door to
another bedroom where Agent 355 is sleeping peacefully

SONIA
She’s fine Bit of a bump to the
head but she should be all right
What happened Yorick I just
found you out there like Thomas
Newton or something

Yorick’s confused

SONIA
The Man Who Fell to Earth

YORICK
Seriously You a fan of the book
or the movie

SONIA
Both I guess Mostly Bowie to be
honest

Yorick’s almost starting to fall for this girl when he
notices Ampersand playing with his RING BOX

Feeling guilty Yorick gets up to SNATCH it away

YORICK
That’s that’s cool

SONIA
Anyway we figure you must be some
kind of genetic anomaly like those
prostitutes in Africa that are
immune to HIV

YORICK

Huh I hadnt

(backing up)
Wait what do you mean “we”

Sonia walks over to the window of this second-story bedroom

SONIA
Yorick this is a town of sixty-
seven gossiping women Did you
really think I could keep something
like you a secret

Yorick joins her at the window and looks out to see all SIXTY-
SEVEN WOMEN a collection of various ages and races (but no
children) gathered below They’re looking up at him
expectantly

Yorick sighs

INT BLACK HAWK HELICOPTER - EVENING

Back inside the passenger hold of Alter’s helicopter she and
Rachel speak to each other over their headsets

RACHEL
We might have a hit Alter Sixty
clicks due south Girls in the
listening stations back home are
reporting a lot of chatter about a
twenty-something male washing
ashore in a little town called
Marrisville

ALTER
Good work We’ll pay a visit right
after we refuel

RACHEL
Actually we should probably send
as many choppers as we can now

ALTER
Why You honestly think some
undersexed American will be ina
hurry to leave an entire village of
lonely women

RACHEL
That’s not my concern Lieutenant-
General I’m worried about who
these women happen to be

EXT SONIA’S HOME -- EVENING
Back at Sonia’s place Yorick’s new friend escorts him
outside She introduces him to the town which stares at
this last man with a mixture of disbelief and mistrust
SONIA
Marrisville this is Yorick
Yorick this is Marrisville

Yorick waves shyly

NINA a middle-aged Hispanic woman gives Yorick the once-
over

NINA

You really the last
YORICK

I I don’t know I think so
NINA

Hn
Sonia leads Yorick through the crowd of gawkers

YORICK
Is it just me or are there no kids
in this town

SONIA
Um I guess I’m the youngest one
yeah Come on you want to help me
in the hydroponic greenhouse

YORICK
You have food Fresh food
SONIA
Sure Why so surprised

YORICK
It’s just almost every post-Plague
town I’ve been to has looked like
the third act of a Godzilla movie

Yorick looks up at the town’s working street lamps

YORICK
But you guys still have a perfect
little utopia

SONIA
I don’t know about that But we
did vote to slaughter one of the
lambs for you tonight And don’t
feel guilty Lydia wants us to get
rid of them anyway before the damn
flies eat them alive

YORICK
Lydia

Suddenly an elderly white woman steps out of the crowd
This is LYDIA

LYDIA
Hard to believe that helpless
little women can get by without
your kind huh

YORICK
I I didn’t mean any disrespect

LYDIA
Weve all had plenty of experience
making do without any men around

Nina steps forward to try to silence Lydia but the old
lady’s on a roll

NINA
Lydia

LYDIA
Back in ‘42 the only fellas left
in this country were the goddamn 4F-
ers tryin’ to get into our
overalls Girls weren’t part of
the workforce we were the
workforce

(MORE )

LYDIA (contd)
If none of our boys had come home
alive we coulda run this place
just fine on our own better
even

YORICK
Back up you said you all had
experience living without men
How I mean most of you are a
little too young to have been doing
the Rosie the Riveter thing right

SONIA
Maybe Lydia can explain herself
after we fix you some supper

Sonia starts to pull Yorick away but Nina calls after him

NINA
Kid The black girl up there she
your wife

YORICK
No I mean she’s just a a
friend But Three’s good people
She’s kind of a government agent
But on the downlow you know

As Sonia and Yorick walk away Nina and Lydia exchange
nervous glances

EXT GREENHOUSE - NIGHT

Cut to a few minutes later for this establishing shot of an
impressive greenhouse Its windows are fogged with
condensation so we can’t quite see inside

INT GREENHOUSE - CONTINUING

Sonia and Yorick enter the well-lit facility which is filled
with fresh flowers and vegetables They’re alone now

YORICK
So you and your neighbors all seem
pretty close-knit Do you mind
can I ask are you all not that I
care but

SONIA
Some are but it’d take a hell of a
lot more than all the men dying to
make me suddenly eat pussy

YORICK
Well you don’t beat around the
bush As it were

SONIA
No I don’t

Suddenly Sonia PULLS Yorick close and KISSES him deeply
Yorick pushes her away but only eventually

YORICK
Sonia

SONIA
What Oh my God Are are you
gay

YORICK

What No No not at all

SONIA
Oh ‘Cause talk about irony

YORICK
It’s just there’s someone else

SONIA
But you said your bodyguard--

Yorick pulls out his PHOTO of Beth which he hands over to
Sonia

YORICK
No my fiancee’s name is Beth
We’re on our way to find her
She’s she’s in Los Angeles

SONIA
It must be hard

Sonia sets aside the photo and presses herself against
Yorick

YORICK
It is

But Yorick gently pulls away from her

YORICK
Look I’m flattered but for some
retarded reason I was picked to
survive all this so I’m trying not
to take advantage of the situation

SONIA
You’re not taking advantage of
anything Yorick

YORICK
But I would be Beth Beth was
my first you know She was the
only woman alive who wanted me back
when I was an unemployed loser If
nothing else I owe her a little
loyalty

Sonia steps forward and runs her fingers through Yorick’s
hair

SONIA
I’m sure lots of girls wanted you
back then They just didn’t know
how to tell you

Again she kisses him Harder this time The two fall
backwards onto one of the greenhouse tables Sonia is on top
of Yorick who’s clearly wrestling with more than just his
conscience

YORICK
Please You you have to get
off

SONIA
(smiling)
I’m trying

She kisses him again

YORICK
Beth--

SONIA
--will never know Besides this
isn’t about her It’s about you
helping the planet and the only
way you can do that is by sowing
your seed right

YORICK
I love her

SONIA
You think JFK didn’t love Jackie
You think MLK didn’t love Coretta
(MORE)

SONIA (contd)
Great men fuck around on their
wives Yorick and whether you like
it or not you’re the greatest man
alive now

Sonia writes against Yorick who’s really struggling to be
good

YORICK
Please

ANOTHER VOICE (0S)
Yorick

Sonia and Yorick look up to see a relatively recuperated
AGENT 355 standing in the doorway of this greenhouse
Ampersand is on her shoulder

AGENT 355
You all right

Sonia and Yorick quickly pull themselves apart like two
teens caught making out at Lovers Leap

YORICK
It’s cool We’re we’re done
here
SONIA
(to Yorick)
I’m so sorry I I don’t know

what came over me I--

AGENT 355
Yorick may I borrow you for a
second

EXT GREENHOUSE - CONTINUING

355 drags the embarrassed last man outside As Yorick
finishes buckling his pants Amp jumps onto his shoulder

YORICK
Look whatever you saw in there

AGENT 355
I don’t care We have to get out
of here

YORICK
Right now I mean this town is a
wonderland We should at least
stock up on provisions and--

AGENT 355
These people aren’t what you think
Yorick They’re--

NINA (0S)
That’s far enough

Cut over to Nina Lydia and several of the other residents of

Marrisville They all have HUNTING RIFLES trained on Yorick
and 355

NINA
Im afraid we can’t let some spy
rat us out to the feds

355 shoots Yorick a dirty look
AGENT 355

Does the secret in secret agent
mean anything to you

YORICK
What is this Some kind of
militia

AGENT 355

There’s a womens penitentiary
about a mile up the road Yorick

YORICK
You mean they’re they’re
convicts

SONIA (0S)
Escaped convicts technically

Yorick turns just as Sonia walks out of the greenhouse

SONIA
When all the men died the warden
decided to turn us loose instead

of letting us starve to death in
our cells

The other women close in on Yorick and 355

NINA
The guards lived in the houses
were in now They took off weeks
ago Guess they couldn’t stand
staying where their kin passed

SONIA
None of us wanted to get out like
this but it happened The other
inmates and I all get along pretty
well and we’ve been taking care of
ourselves for years already so
this community just kinda fell
into place

YORICK

What did you do Murder someone
SONIA

Robbed a bank For a guy Long

story
Lydia aims her rifle at Yorick

LYDIA
If you’re looking for a killer you
got one I shot my bastard of a
husband in ‘59 and I don’t regret
it for a goddamn second

Sonia walks over to Lydia and pushes her rifle down

SONIA
(to Yorick and 355)
Please We just want to live in
peace

AGENT 355
(to the women)
This isn’t my jurisdiction and we
have no intention of telling anyone
about your situation

NINA
Why should we believe some spook

355 starts to lose her cool so it’s Yorick’s turn to play
peacemaker

AGENT 355
For your sake I hope you’re
talking about my occupation and not
my race

YORICK
Look let’s all just pretend
tonight never happened okay 355
and I have bigger things to worry
about so we’re just gonna--

Suddenly Yorick is illuminated from directly overhead by a
burningly bright SPOTLIGHT He looks up half-expecting to
see a mother ship here to take him home

A WHIRLWIND kicks up dirt and leaves as three BLACK HAWK
HELICOPTERS descend into view

NINA
It’s a setup

AGENT 355
No I have nothing to do with this

Like the word of God a familiar voice booms from the heavens
over one of the chopper’s loudspeakers It’s Alter

FROM HELICOPTER
Women of Marrisville this is not
your fight Hand over the boy and
no one will be harmed

As the helicopters circle to land in a nearby field a
baffled Yorick turns to 355

YORICK
Why does everyone keep calling me
boy Im a college graduate

Nina again swings her rifle in 355’s direction

NINA
Whatever we’re not fighting an
army They can take you both for
all I care

YORICK
What the hell does the Israeli
military want with me

AGENT 355

If it was anything good they
probably only would have brought
one gunship

(to the women)
Please If you hand Yorick over to
another country you people will
never know another peaceful day

NINA
If we don’t we’ll never know
another day period

Sonia suddenly steps in front of Yorick and 355

SONIA
Run They’re probably landing by
the orchard so you’ve still got a
few minutes Take Lewis to
Montecito No street lamps there
so you’ll have some cover for a
getaway

LYDIA
You lost your head girl

Sonia looks at Yorick with sad eyes

SONIA
We still owe a debt to society and
without someone like him there
might not be another one

355 nods gratefully before dragging Yorick away from the
scene As he’s being pulled away Yorick calls after Sonia

YORICK
Wait Sonia Come come with
us

Sonia just watches with regret as the man who fell to Earth
disappears into the darkness

SONIA
Good-bye Yorick

EXT SUBURBAN STREETS - NIGHT

355 and Yorick run through the unlit outskirts of this
neighborhood A winded Yorick is falling out of his Chuck
Taylors

AGENT 355
Keep up goddammit

YORICK
(breathless)
Totally not running shoes

As the two round the corner they run smack into another
Black Hawk helicopter this one parked in the middle of the
street

Three female IDF SOLDIERS all drop their cigarettes and
raise their machine guns as they spot Yorick and his
bodyguard

AGENT 355
Four gunships

The youngest Israeli soldier looks for guidance from her
older superiors

YOUNG SOLDIER
(in Hebrew)
What what do we do

OLDER SOLDIER

(in Hebrew)
We take the male alive but kill
anyone who--

That’s all 355 needs to hear as she raises her weapon and
FIRES it at the two older soldiers killing them both
instantly

Yorick screams in fear and revulsion

355 aims her Glock at the youngest soldier (she’s frozen in
terror) and squeezes the trigger Nothing The gun’s empty

With trembling hands the young soldier aims her SIDEARM at

YOUNG SOLDIER
(in Hebrew)
Fuh--freeze

355 instead TOSSES her own weapon aside and CHARGES directly
at the young female soldier

The soldier fires wildly as the screaming Culper Ring agent
rushes her 355 eventually TACKLES the soldier knocking her
to the ground The two wrestle over the Israeli’s firearm
as the young soldier struggles with what few English phrases
she remembers

AGENT 355
Let go of the gun Please

YOUNG SOLDIER
Lo Bevakasha

AGENT 355
You don’t have to die

YOUNG SOLDIER
Take take me to my hotel How
much does this cost please Where
is the library Which train--

BANG
Push in close on the two women as one of them is SHOT

AGENT 355
(under her breath)
Stupid

355 stands as the young soldier rattles her last breath

The Culper Ring agent looks over at Yorick who promptly
VOMITS all over his own shoes

AGENT 355
Come on

YORICK
Why why did you

AGENT 355
Me or them Let’s go

YORICK
They were girls If you’re such a
fucking markswoman couldn’t you
have just wounded them or--

AGENT 355
This isn’t a comic book Yorick
They knew what they were doing when
they filled their hands and so did
I Now get in the chopper

YORICK
Now we’re stealing helicopters
No I I don’t want anything more
to do with this

AGENT 355
If you had listened to me on the
train we wouldn’t be in this
situation Now do as I fucking
say

YORICK
Go on without me Three I’m tired
of people dying I’m I’m just
gonna surrender

355 aims her weapon at Yorick

AGENT 355
That stopped being your decision
the second other countries got
involved

Ampersand barks in protest but Yorick hangs his head He’s
done fighting

In the distance a faraway gun battle can be heard

EXT GREENHOUSE - NIGHT

Sonia and her fellow inmates are waging an epic battle
against the incoming army but they’re clearly no match for
the Israelis’ numbers

As more and more of them take fire the surviving townswomen
eventually lay down their arms and hold up their hands in
surrender Sonia screams in defiance

SONIA
Keep fighting We can take them

As the shooting dies down Alter steps out from behind her
troops’ frontline

ALTER
Thank you for your attention The
good news is that I have no
interest in taking prisoners so
you don’t need to fear another
incarceration

Alter pulls out her sidearm and AIMS it at Nina’s head

ALTER
The bad news is that I have no
objection to field executions

The rest of the townswomen start to rush to Nina’s defense
but the overpowering IDF soldiers back them off

ALTER
Tell me where you’re hiding Yorick
Brown or I start putting bullets in
brainpans

Sonia drops her rifle and calls out

SONIA
Don’t He he ran away

Alter cocks her gun

ALTER
Nonsense I stationed roadblocks at
every possible exit He--

After consulting with a young female soldier carrying a RADIO
PACK Rachel steps forward to whisper something to Alter

RACHEL
Alter North Team is dead One of
our snipers saw their chopper being
stolen She thinks she caught a
glimpse of a black woman behind the
controls

Alter looks at Rachel in stunned silence for a moment

ALTER
(to her troops)
Kill them all

Sonia charges forward and all of the IDF Soldiers promptly
aim their rifles at her

SONIA
Wait I I can tell you where he
went He has a girlfriend In
LA Beth something

Careful not to make anyone think she’s reaching for a gun
Sonia slowly pulls out the PHOTO that Yorick left behind

Alter stares at the picture of this once-happy couple with
interest

EXT AMERICAN AIRSPACE - DAWN

Several hours later 355’s stolen Black Hawk soars just above
the treetops of Middle America

INT STOLEN BLACK HAWK - CONTINUING

Cut inside the hi-tech vehicle’s cockpit where 355 is
flying Yorick is in the passenger seat with Ampersand on
his lap

AGENT 355
Yorick I’m I’m sorry about back
there okay I never should have
pointed a gun at you

YORICK
Yeah well guess I opened that
door

A nervous Yorick just silently stares out the window as their
craft barely skims the foliage

YORICK
I can’t believe you really know how
to fly this thing

AGENT 355
I told you the Culper Ring trained
me well

YORICK

How do you study espionage
exactly Is there some kind of
correspondence school

AGENT 355
The Ring recruited me out of a
foster care facility when I was
thirteen after I put two redneck
teenagers in the hospital for
calling me names

YORICK
Foster care

AGENT 355
My parents were killed I was six

Yorick suddenly looks guilty

YORICK
Sorry

AGENT 355
Don’t be You weren’t driving the
truck that night

YORICK
You know before all this I
honestly wasn’t sure if your whole
undercover sister spiel was legit
or if you were you know insane

AGENT 355
Yorick a mentally ill person
wouldn’t be able to fly a medium-
lift assault helicopter below radar
at 250 miles per--

Suddenly the chopper DIPS uncomfortably as one of its
extended range fuel tanks accidentally CLIPS a high branch

AGENT 355
Oops

A frightened Yorick looks down at his diaper-clad monkey who
yelps

YORICK
(quietly to Amp)
Yeah I’m gonna need a diaper
change too buddy

355 activates a few controls on her dash

AGENT 355
If you want to help check that
navigation computer and make sure
were on target for San Fran

YORICK
We’re still headed to this Attack
of the Clones doctor

AGENT 355

A few refuelings aside we should
be able to fly a straight shot to
her lab It’s more important than
ever that we find out why you’re
still alive

YORICK

Yeah but what if Victoria and her
goons get to Mann’s joint first
We lost some time in Marrisville

AGENT 355
Don’t worry the trains are about
as dependable as they were in pre-
Mussolini Italy remember We’11
beat her by days

EXT RAILROAD CROSSING - MORNING

Smash cut to this close-up of a DEAD MALE COWBOY slumped
over the wheel of his pick-up Pull out to reveal that this
unlucky corpse’s truck is parked directly in the middle of
RAILROAD TRACKS

BAM The vehicle is OBLITERATED when a familiar DIESEL TRAIN
plows right through it

INT DIESEL TRAIN ENGINE - CONTINUING

Inside the train’s engine Victoria is reading to Theresa
(the bald Amazon) while an overweight FEMALE CONDUCTOR
reluctantly works the train’s throttle

VICTORIA
“With no aspect of society being at
all relevant to women there
remains to civic-minded females
only to overthrow the government
and destroy the male sex” Those
are the opening words of the SCUM
Manifesto the seminal work of our
dear sister Valerie Solanas a
prophet and a--

CONDUCTOR
Um ma’am

Theresa immediately whips out a CROWBAR which she uses to
threaten the conductor

THERESA
“Maam” is short for madam the
mistress who manages a man’s
household or the whore who enslaves
other women Which one are you
saying Victoria is

VICTORIA
Let her speak Theresa

CONDUCTOR
I don’t mean to start trouble m
Victoria but I’m gonna have to
stop at the next station to pick up
medical supplies for California

VICTORIA
That can wait sister

CONDUCTOR
Begging your pardon but it can’t
If you care about women so much
there are girls with diabetes and
whatnot suffering as we speak
Seeing how the shipping lanes died
with all the sailor boys the only
way anyone’s gettin’ insulin is--

Victoria puts a hand on the frightened woman’s back

VICTORIA
Nothing is more resilient or
resourceful than womankind I’m
confident our sisters will make do

EXT LA TRIAGE CENTER - EVENING

Cut to later that night where HUNDREDS OF WOMEN are gathered
outside a makeshift triage center in downtown Los Angeles
All of these Angelenos are helping one another there are no
pockets of violence It’s a welcome bit of peace

INT LA TRIAGE CENTER - CONTINUING

Push inside where Yorick’s long lost girlfriend BETH DEVILLE
is sitting at a round table leading a diverse group of
FEMALE COMMUNITY LEADERS in a meeting She turns her
attention to a young Asian woman named CHLOE

BETH
All right so Fara is taking care
of Meals on Wheels outside the
valley Chloe what’s our postal
situation

CHLOE
A step above Pony Express but a
far cry from UPS Still not bad
considering the only thing mailmen
are carrying these days is disease

BETH
Speaking of which how are we on
antibiotics Nora

Beth turns to NORA a sixty-something pharmacist

NORA
Unless you’re in the market for six
crates of Viagra Im dangerously
low on every drug in the--

Suddenly the sound of HELICOPTERS is heard outside The
women all race to a nearby window where they see Black Hawks
approaching Chloe and Nora are immediately excited

CHLOE
Is that military Oh God are
they finally dropping supplies

NORA
Behold the angels storm the gates
of hell

Push in on Beth the only one who looks nervous

EXT LAS VEGAS - EVENING

On cue jump to Las Vegas as its entire gaudy skyline BURNS
in a spectacular inferno

EXT LAS VEGAS’S MCCARRAN AIRPORT - CONTINUING

Cut over to the airport across the highway where Yorick and
355 calmly watch this conflagration Their grounded
helicopter is REFUELING next to a tanker truck at the Vegas
airport Ampersand is playing on the hose connected to the
Black Hawk

YORICK
This is men’s fault too right
Because we taught our daughters to
be showgirls instead of firemen

AGENT 355
Firefighters
Yorick is fed up
YORICK

You know I’m not the He-Man Woman-
Hater you think I am I didn’t
roadie for Lilith Fair or anything
but I’m down with the cause I
rarely make sexist jokes always
hold doors open for ladies

Suddenly 355 gets into a SPARRING position

YORICK
I mean I never hold doors open

AGENT 355
I’m not always going to be around
to protect you Yorick But the
SUV of the sky here needs
another ten to finish gassing up
so I figured I might as well teach
you a little self-defense

Yorick waves her off

YORICK
I’ve gotten myself out of plenty of
scrapes before thanks

AGENT 355
In what Double Dragon

YORICK
Double Dragon What are you
forty

355 playfully flicks him the finger

YORICK
Like many a high school nerd I
survived bullies in the tried and
true fashion of fighting like a
girl

AGENT 355
Which means what exactly

YORICK
Scratching eyes pulling hair
kicking balls Not that the last
one is so applicable anymore

AGENT 355
Why not just go to the gym

YORICK
What’s the point You know what
the strongest muscle in the human
body is

AGENT 355
The heart

YORICK
No it’s not the heart you sappy
fuck It’s your jaw muscle Even
a scrawny dude like me has five
hundred pounds of bite strength

AGENT 355
Great that’1l come in handy when
youre fighting food

As the helicopter continues to refuel the two sit down on
its edge and watch the fires continue to rage in the
distance

Ampersand scampers over to sit on Yorick’s lap

YORICK
Hey before all this did you you
know Have somebody

AGENT 355
Not for a while My relationships
always ended bad

YORICK
Because of your job

355 takes a deep breath

AGENT 355
Because men are all cheating
bastards
YORICK
Oh Hey look what happened with
Sonia
She softens a bit
AGENT 355

Relax You’ve got to be the only
guy on the planet who’d end up in
this position and not try to bang
everything that moves

YORICK
Yeah well I scored someone way
above my pay grade

A wave of sadness suddenly washes over Yorick 355
recognizes it and reaches out to touch his shoulder

AGENT 355
Beth is still out there Yorick
You’11 find her soon and she’1l be
fine

YORICK
How do you know

AGENT 355
I don’t I’m just saying whatever
shit will get you to stop moping

A smiling Yorick sets Ampersand down and stands into sparring
position

YORICK
Okay show me what you got killer

355 rises to meet him

AGENT 355
Your funeral

The two playfully throw punches while black smoke continues
to billow into the Vegas sky

EXT CALIFORNIA TRAIN STATION -- EVENING

Later that night Victoria and her fellow Daughters of the
Amazon exit their train Theresa looks concerned

THERESA
Last stop Victoria and Dr Mann’s
laboratory is gonna take at least
another ten hours to reach on foot

VICTORIA
Why the hell would we travel on
foot Theresa

THERESA
Well bikes are pretty much
nonexistent after we lost ours
boarding this thing and the
highways are too clogged with
makeshift hearses for us to all
pile into a Greyhound or whatever

Walking along the tracks Victoria approaches a LIVESTOCK
CAR

VICTORIA
Do you know what the Girl Scout
motto is

Victoria stops in front of a car filled with a dozen young
female HORSES

VICTORIA
Same as the Boy Scouts’
EXT DR MANN’S LABORATORY - NIGHT

Hours later 355’s helicopter LANDS in the empty parking lot
just outside of Mann’s modest laboratory in San Francisco

Push in on the craft as Yorick (with Ampersand on his
shoulder) exits the helicopter with Agent 355 They inspect
the darkened lab

YORICK
Abandoned

AGENT 355
Maybe I’11 look around You and
your animal stay here

YORICK
And let you inspect the mad
scientist’s haunted laboratory all
by yourself If you insist

Ampersand chirps as 355 walks into the black building

INT DR MANN’S LABORATORY -- CONTINUING

355 steps inside the eerily quiet building and draws her
sidearm just in case

AGENT 355
Hello

Just then she hears something SNAP behind a door to her
left

Slowly 355 turns its knob and pushes her way inside A
small GENERATOR is whirring away quietly as it powers
numerous COMPUTER TERMINALS ELECTRON MICROSCOPES etc

AGENT 355
Dr Mann Dr Allison M--

Suddenly a figure steps out from behind the door and presses
a HYPODERMIC NEEDLE millimeters away from a frozen 355’s
neck

It’s DR MANN

DR MANN
There are enough sedatives in this
syringe to put a woman twice your
size to sleep for a month

AGENT 355
I’m not here to hurt you Doctor

DR MANN
The Black Hawk you parked in the
handicap spot suggests otherwise

AGENT 355
I’m here to protect you I’m Agent
355 I--

A terrified Mann immediately BACKS AWAY from her hostage

DR MANN
You work for the Culper Ring

With lightning speed 355 reaches up and GRABS Mann’s wrist
snatching the hypodermic away from her

AGENT 355
How the hell do you know about the
Culpers

Dr Mann takes a seat in one of her lab chairs exhausted

DR MANN
You’re the people responsible for
all this

AGENT 355
(a beat)
What

DR MANN
“Project Setting Son” or whatever
you monsters called it

A disbelieving 355 aims her Glock at the doctor

AGENT 355
What are you talking about

DR MANN

Please if you’re going to kill me
just do it but spare me the
feigned ignorance

AGENT 355

Doctor look at me I have no idea
what this is all about I’m here
to protect you from from people
who want to use you

DR MANN
Like your superiors did

AGENT 355
Which superiors

DR MANN
Youre serious The Culper men
honestly kept their foot soldiers
in the dark about their real plans

355 lowers her gun and sits down across from Mann ready to
listen

DR MANN
Your “ring” was terrified of the
possibility of our country
eventually having to fight a ground
war with the Chinese military So
a man named 1033 (Ten-thirty-
three”) apparently began
considering the possibility of a
preemptive biological strike

AGENT 355
How how do you know all this

DR MANN
Because Ten told me He came here
once a week offered me millions in
exchange for helping to make his
sick vision a reality

AGENT 355
His vision

DR MANN
Discretely releasing a chemical
agent into Beijing’s air supply
one that wouldn’t harm civilians
but would prevent its women from
conceiving male children His hope
was that it could be used to
effectively cripple China’s
economic and military capabilities
within a generation

AGENT 355
Someone from the Culper Ring did
this That’s that’s impossible
DR MANN

If only I refused to have
anything to do with Ten’s tests
but he and his team proceeded to
the experimental stage without me

AGENT 355
What happened
DR MANN
What always happens when man tries
to fuck with Mother Nature

Dr Mann stands and looks out her window at nothing in
particular

DR MANN
I knew the second I read their
preliminary research that the
environmental impact of even an
isolated test would be severe
but I had no idea it would be this

AGENT 355
But how did it spread so quickly

DR MANN
Morphogenetic fields Trade winds
Migrating flocks Your guess is as
good as mine All I know is that
there doesn’t seem to be one corner
of the globe that wasn’t affected

AGENT 355
Can it be reversed

DR MANN
I can’t raise the dead Agent

AGENT 355
But can you bring mankind back to
the planet

DR MANN
The Plague destroyed every last
sperm fetus and fully developed
mammal with a Y chromosome And
whatever was released into the
atmosphere is still there Ive
attempted to make new XY rats by
using the cells of dead subjects
but they all end up suffering the
same fate as their late brethren
I’m afraid a living male will never
again set foot on this planet

YORICK (0S)
Then this is one small step for
man

355 and Dr Mann turn to see YORICK walk inside the room
Ampersand is on his shoulder as always

YORICK
Etcetera etcetera

Mann’s jaw goes slack

DR MANN
Oh oh my God

YORICK
I get that a lot

Much to Yorick’s surprise the doctor rushes over to inspect
Ampersand

DR MANN
The size of those canines Is this
monkey a male

YORICK
Uh yeah Actually I’m also--

DR MANN
Obviously I could understand one
of you being some kind of mutation
but how did you both survive

YORICK
Doc the last time I delved into
science on my own it involved a
baking soda volcano nearly blowing
off one of my testicles I was
kinda hoping you had some answers

DR MANN
Where did you find this creature

Mann takes Ampersand from Yorick but the animal LEAPS out of
her hands and starts playing with one of the nearby TEST
TUBES

YORICK
Online at this volunteer group’s
website But maybe Ampersand I
don’t know escaped from some Area
51 research facility first He
certainly seems at home here

Mann inspects Ampersand’s fur

DR MANN
He’s not tagged with any lab
markings I’11 need to take a
blood sample From both of you

355 is lost in her own world still processing her group’s
unforgivable betrayal

AGENT 355
I I dedicated my life to those
men

YORICK

I’m sorry Three but we gotta save
the existential crises for later
right

(to Mann)
Do whatever you need to get
started Doc but there’s a crazy
train blowing into town with your
name on it so we should really be
out of here by morning

Mann ominously pulls on a single RUBBER GLOVE

DR MANN
We’ll leave when I’m good and
ready Last man or not it’s going
to take more than the apocalypse
for me to start taking orders from
my patients

EXT LA TRIAGE CENTER - NIGHT

Back in Los Angeles Beth leads the other local women
outside as the Black Hawks make a dramatic landing

ALTER steps out of the first chopper and immediately
approaches Beth

ALTER
Beth Deville Your reputation
precedes you

BETH
Youre not Americans are you Who
the hell are you peop--

Before Beth can say another word someone comes up behind her
and places an ETHER-SOAKED RAG over her mouth As she slips
into unconsciousness Beth falls back into the arms of
RACHEL Alter’s second-in-command

Beth’s friends scream in horror and race to help their
colleague but the Israeli soldiers back them away with their
machine guns while Rachel and Alter carry the sleeping Beth
into their copter
RACHEL
What now We just take up position
here and wait for the boy to come
to us

ALTER
No young Mr Brown and his mystery
associate have already killed three
of our soldiers and stolen one of
our ships He’s obviously not a
threat to be taken lightly We
need a more fortified staging area
if we’re going to take him alive

Rachel considers this

RACHEL
Have you seen Citizen Kane

Alter just stares at her blankly

INT DR MANN’S LABORATORY - NIGHT

Open on an image of Y-SHAPED PROTEINS as seen through
incredibly powerful microscope

DR MANN (0S)
It’s about sex

Pull out as Mann looks up from her work

DR MANN
Like everything it’s about sex

355 and Yorick are confused

YORICK
Uh

DR MANN
A foreign agent was introduced into
your animal’s bloodstream and his
immune system produced unique
antibodies to fight it Somehow
these antibodies had the added side
effect of masking him from the
effects of the Plague

AGENT 355
Howd this “foreign agent” end up
inside a monkey

an

DR MANN
It appears to travel through the
body much like syphilis or
hepatitis so my guess is that it
was sexually transmitted

YORICK
But how did it get inside me

355 and Dr Mann just stare at Yorick and Ampersand

YORICK
Okay that’s just sick I did not
blow my monkey

DR MANN
Well did it ever bite you deeply
enough to draw blood

YORICK
No the only person he ever bit
was

The truth slowly dawns on Yorick

YORICK
Beth JI fucked Beth

355 and Dr Mann just look at each other

YORICK
Look I had sex with my girlfriend
and Ampersand bit her Whatever
mojo saved the two of us must have
come from Beth

AGENT 355
How’s that possible How is she
connected with the Culper Ring

DR MANN
She’s not I don’t think this
antidote was created deliberately
It’s another moldy Petri dish that
turns out to be penicillin

YORICK
Beth isn’t mildew she’s a genius

DR MANN
I don’t care about her mind I care
about her body What made her
special

(MORE )

DR MANN (contd)
Was she ever diagnosed with a rare
blood disorder Polycythemia vera
or Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura
or--

YORICK
Her shot Beth’s been testing some
kind of of injectable
contraceptive on herself

DR MANN
Then she might be the greatest
failure in the history of
science because her “birth
control” could very well be the key
to repopulating the entire planet

As this slowly sinks in a vindicated Yorick celebrates

YORICK
I knew it I knew we should have
been looking for Beth all along

AGENT 355
Doctor can you replicate the
antibodies inside Yorick and
Ampersand

DR MANN
Maybe but I need to know exactly
what triggered their creation
before I can retro-engineer an
inoculation

AGENT 355
Then we have to get to Los Angeles
fast before Beth--

Suddenly a SQUAWKING is heard coming from outside Mann’s
laboratory window 355 draws her weapon

DR MANN
The hell is that

YORICK
Sounds like it’s coming from our
copter

EXT DR MANN’S LABORATORY - CONTINUING

355 warily escorts her companions outside as Yorick notes a
flashing light on the helicopter’s cockpit

YORICK
We have a radio

AGENT 355
Don’t touch it Yorick Just--

FROM RADIO
I repeat this message is for
Yorick Brown You have until
midnight to surrender yourself to
us at the Hearst Castle in San
Simeon If you don’t we will be
forced to terminate your loved one

The blood drains out of Yorick’s face as his GIRLFRIEND’S
VOICE comes over the speaker

FROM RADIO
You people are insane My
boyfriend is dead Yorick is dead

Change angles so that we’re now looking at Yorick through the
familiar POV of a pair of BINOCULARS

EXT SAN FRANCISCO HILLTOP - NIGHT

Reverse angles to reveal that these field glasses belong to
Victoria who’s standing at the top of a nearby San Francisco
hill in front of her assembled troops most of whom are now
mounted on HORSEBACK

Victoria lowers the binoculars to speak with Theresa her
bald-headed second-in-command

VICTORIA
I don’t suppose that’s his clone

THERESA
Where the hell did they get a
helicopter

VICTORIA
I have no idea but we’re not
letting him steal the good doctor
for himself Bring me Sam

THERESA
Are you sure

Victoria just glares at Theresa who quickly summons TWO
AMAZON RECRUITS carrying a LONG CRATE

THERESA
Sorry just thought we were saving
her to use on Mount Rushmore

Victoria opens this box

VICTORIA
The best laid plans of mice and
men

revealing that “Sam” is actually a SURFACE TO AIR MISSILE
LAUNCHER

EXT DR MANN’S LABORATORY - NIGHT

Cut back to Yorick and the others outside the helicopter
still debating what to do about Beth

DR MANN
We have to tell these people what
they have This Beth girl is the
Holy Grail

AGENT 355

Somehow I don’t think that’s going
to make the Israelis more likely to
part with her

YORICK
Then I have to give myself up

AGENT 355
No If they take you it’s going
to destabilize the entire world

YORICK

Like it’s not destabilized already
What difference is one less guy
gonna make to the--

Just then Yorick and the others are violently THROWN to the
ground as the entire tail section of the Black Hawk EXPLODES
after being struck by a SAM missile

355 groggily gets to her feet and looks up to see a STAMPEDE
of mounted Amazons charging down a hill in the background

AGENT 355
Jesus Christ

YORICK
What

355 yells at a temporarily deafened Yorick who’s holding his
terrified pet monkey

AGENT 355
We have to get out of here

YORICK
WHAT

An impatient 355 helps a disoriented Dr Mann to her feet

AGENT 355
Do you have a car

DR MANN
(sheepishly)
Sort of
AGENT 355
What does that mean
EXT REAR ALLEY - CONTINUING

Open tight on a “Y” logo and pull out to reveal that it’s
attached to the front of a 1990 YUGO CONVERTIBLE

Yorick and his companions race for this tiny vehicle which
is parked in the narrow alleyway behind Mann’s lab

YORICK
A Yugo

DR MANN
Hey don’t blame me for this
country’s pathetic funding of the
sciences
355 throws her duffel bag into the passenger seat
AGENT 355
Mann you drive Yorick get in
the back and keep your head down
355 pulls out a PUMP-ACTION MOSSBERG
AGENT 355
I got shotgun
EXT SAN FRANCISCO HILLTOP - CONTINUING

Outside the alley the car soon SCREECHES around the corner

The vehicle dodges several larger cars still parked in the
middle of the street (leftover victims of the Plague) as
Mann and Co are immediately confronted by the oncoming posse
of horse-riding Daughters of the Amazons

DR MANN
Are you kidding me

The car’s hood is soon PEPPERED with shots fired from the
rifle-toting Amazons 355 leans out of the convertible and
RETURNS FIRE

DR MANN
Don’t shoot the horses

AGENT 355
Don’t you experiment on animals for
a living

DR MANN
You kill a horse I’1l drive us
into a lamppost

355 shakes her head as she SHOOTS another girl careful not
to hit any of the mares

The Yugo FLIES past Victoria who circles around to GIVE
CHASE to the slow-moving car

VICTORIA
We want the doctor alive Save
your bullets for the boy

Inside the car Yorick sticks his head up from the back seat

YORICK
What’s this thing’s top speed
eleven

DR MANN

It’s a goddamn obstacle course
I’m doing my best

355 turns around and angrily PUSHES Yorick back down as she
FIRES a shot over his head

AGENT 355
Do better If we can’t shake them
by San Simeon well have two sides
going to war over Yorick

Suddenly realizing what she’s just said 355 lowers her gaze
to look down at Yorick whose expression is equally knowing

EXT HEARST CASTLE - NIGHT

Welcome to this ridiculously palatial estate overlooking the
Pacific Ocean a shrine to man’s self-indulgence

Alter’s troops are at the ready outside guns drawn in front
of their two parked helicopters while the third chopper
circles directly above this modern-day Xanadu

INT HEARST’S PRIVATE SUITE - CONTINUING

Inside Mr Hearst’s private suite a room filled with an
obscene amount of MIRRORS Beth is TIED to an ornately carved
chair She screams against her gag and the muffled cries
for help echo throughout this massive room

EXT SUITE BALCONY - CONTINUING

Just outside Beth’s makeshift prison Alter and Rachel are
surveying troop movements from the castle’s GRAND BALCONY

RACHEL
Yorick’s not coming for her Alter
He could have any woman he wanted

ALTER
So could Menelaus and he still
launched a thousand ships to
retrieve Helen of Troy Trust me
there’s only one thing a man wants

Alter points at an APPROACHING VEHICLE kicking up dust in the
distance

ALTER
The woman he can’t have
INT YUGO - NIGHT

Cut inside this approaching vehicle as a nervous Mann
chauffeurs 355 and Yorick towards certain doom

DR MANN
How sure are you about this plan

Yorick and 355 speak over each other

YORICK AGENT 355
Forty percent Ten percent

Dr Mann just sighs as Yorick reaches back to pull up the
vehicle’s CONVERTIBLE TOP

YORICK
That’s a combined fifty percent
baby Even odds we live through
this

EXT HEARST CASTLE - CONTINUING

The car SKIDS to an impressive halt and the female IDF
Soldiers cautiously approach it

EXT SUITE BALCONY - CONTINUING

Rachel inspects the car through BINOCULARS as Alter gives
orders over a BULLHORN

RACHEL
He’s not alone Looks like at
least two others in there but
snipers won’t be able to get a
clear shot at them while the top is
up A Trojan Horse

ALTER
(through bullhorn)
Hold your fire until the target is
out of the vehicle Approach with
caution and--

RACHEL
Ah Alter

An annoyed Alter lowers her megaphone

ALTER
What now

RACHEL
Forget the horse they brought
the fucking cavalry

EXT HEARST CASTLE - CONTINUING

Cut back outside as VICTORIA leads her mounted troops
thundering up the castle’s main driveway

Theresa looks up to see the Israelis’ helicopter and rides
up alongside her leader

THERESA
Victoria what is this

VICTORIA
Endgame

Victoria and her heavily armed troops come to a stop on one
side of the parked Yugo as the confused IDF troops square
off against them on the other side

INT YUGO - CONTINUING

Back inside the vehicle the trio nervously watches this
showdown

DR MANN
We’re dead

AGENT 355
No the Amazons won’t risk hurting
you and the Israelis want Yorick
alive They’re not going to be
shooting at us

YORICK
Yeah haven’t you ever seen two
girls go at it over a guy Doc
After the first slap they forget
he ever existed

EXT HEARST CASTLE - CONTINUING

As Victoria’s followers keep their weapons trained on the
opposing army the Amazon leader addresses the Israelis

VICTORIA
Sisters your animal instincts tell
you to shelter this boy but ask
yourselves are you animals or are
you women Why give your lives to
defend some testosterone-drunk
predator

EXT SUITE BALCONY - CONTINUING

Alter and Rachel are still on their high-ground perch
overlooking this face-off

ALTER
They’re not with the boy they’re

Alter picks up a small handheld radio

ALTER
Air team take them out

Cut to the Israelis’ one airborne helicopter as it circles
above the mounted Daughters of the Amazon and UNLEASHES a
thousand rounds of ammunition

EXT HEARST CASTLE - CONTINUING

As her mounted warriors take heavy fire Victoria barks out
orders

VICTORIA
Kill them all let the Goddess sort
them out

Theresa again produces the SAM Launcher which she FIRES
at the helicopter above Its main rotor EXPLODES and the
helpless craft spirals towards oblivion ultimately CRASHING
on top of several IDF ground troops

The Amazons cheer but the surviving Israelis quickly resume
their firefight

INT YUGO - CONTINUING

With the two armies otherwise occupied 355 gathers her
weapons and reaches for the passenger-side door

AGENT 355
All right I’m gonna make a break
around back and try to find Beth
As long as these assholes don’t run
out of bullets you two should be
safe in here

EXT HEARST CASTLE - CONTINUING

Yorick calls after her but 355 is already gone As she
dodges the crossfire 355 DIVES for a row of hedges on the
sidelines of this battle

INT YUGO - CONTINUING

Back inside the tiny car Ampersand LEAPS out of Yorick’s
arms and goes running out the car’s window after 355

YORICK
Goddammit Ampersand Get back--

Yorick starts to open his door but quickly closes it as a
HAIL OF GUNFIRE kicks up dirt just outside the car

EXT CASTLE GARDEN - CONTINUING

At the rear of the sprawling estate 355 carefully lurks
around a maze of crumbling old marble columns She
accidentally brushes past a loose fragment of one of these
pillars which falls to the ground with a not insignificant
CHUNK

Nearby the TWO LONE IDF GIRLS entrusted with guarding
this rear entrance turn their machine guns in the direction
of this sound An outgunned 355 steadies her SILENCED PISTOL
and takes a breath preparing to confront these women

Just then a SCREECHING is heard and the two soldiers pivot
to see Ampersand hissing at them from another column in the
background

Before this bizarre sight has time to sink in with the two
soldiers 355 takes advantage of the distraction to SHOOT the
women dead 355 looks at the capuchin monkey with a hint of
gratitude

Unfortunately Ampersand proves to be just as useless as
ever as his noises apparently attracted the attention of a
THIRD GUARD one who promptly SHOOTS 355

The bullet enters high in her left collarbone just above her
heart with enough force to KNOCK 355 backwards Before she
falls 355 squeezes off a single round HITTING her attacker
square in the eye

COLLAPSING to the ground 355 fights to maintain
consciousness but her eyes start to roll back into her head

Ampersand watches all this with seeming indifference

EXT HEARST CASTLE - CONTINUING

Back at the main battlezone Victoria again rallies her
followers

VICTORIA
Hold your ground sisters Give me
cover while I retrieve our savior

Still on horseback Victoria’s mare GALLOPS into the fray
The Amazon dismounts when she reaches Yorick’s vehicle

She promptly RIPS OPEN the Yugo’s driver-side door

VICTORIA
Dr Mann I presume

Victoria starts PULLING Mann out of the car but Yorick is
holding onto the doctor’s feet

VICTORIA
Don’t struggle you belong with me

DR MANN
(struggling)
I only date sane chicks

Mann pulls out the same HYPODERMIC she threatened 355 with
and PLUNGES it into Victoria’s arm The Amazon leader looks
at this needle with confusion before finally COLLAPSING
while Yorick PULLS Mann back inside the car
EXT SUITE BALCONY - CONTINUING
Back on the balcony Rachel watches the battle with disgust

RACHEL
By the time we kill the last of
these maniacs they’ll have wiped
out half our platoon We have to
stop this

Cut over to Alter as she opens a crate of GAS GRENADES

ALTER
I concur

RACHEL
Fentanyl No the gas is too
unpredictable When the Russians
used it on those Chechen women--

ALTER
Yorick’s a virile young man It
won’t kill him

RACHEL
But if the wind carries a strong
enough concentration our girls’
way they could be paralyzed or
worse We have to call them back
first

ALTER
Retreat And risk letting those
savages escape with our prize

Push in on Alter as she begins loading a grenade into a
large RIOT GUN

ALTER
I’m afraid that’s not an option

Cut back to Rachel as she reluctantly DRAWS her sidearm and
aims it at her superior

RACHEL
Put it down Lieutenant-General

Alter slowly lowers the riot gun
ALTER

You remember the punishment for
treason I trust
RACHEL
I should have done this back in Tel
Aviv You’re a disgrace to our
country and our--

With a flick of the wrist Alter produces a DAGGER WITH A
PEARL HANDLE She steps forward and quickly PLUNGES it into
Rachel’s heart

She stares into the girl’s eyes as Rachel’s pupils become
still and black

ALTER
I forgive you

As Rachel’s lifeless body crumbles to the balcony floor
Alter picks up her riot gun and LAUNCHES several grenades
down at the ongoing battle below

Push past Alter into a close-up of Beth still hostage in the
room behind her The gagged girl has been watching this
entire act of barbarism Her eyes flash both fear and rage

EXT HEARST CASTLE - CONTINUING

As the fentanyl gas grenades IMPACT against the battlefield
IDF soldiers immediately drop their weapons and KEEL OVER

The Amazons soon follow suit as their horses struggle to
stay upright before finally COLLAPSING pinning the equally
unconscious female warriors under their heavy bodies

INT YUGO - CONTINUING

Inside the vehicle Mann watches this shocking display of
chemical warfare with terror

A panicking Yorick fumbles for the little car’s buttons

YORICK
The windows

But a frantic Mann quickly opens her door and starts to climb
outside

DR MANN
No the vents will let it all in
anyway We have to get outside
Get low Get
Push in on an instantly unconscious Mann as she promptly
falls FACE FIRST onto the hard earth

INT HEARST’S PRIVATE SUITE - CONTINUING

Beth shudders as someone PULLS OFF her cloth gag She looks
up to see Alter standing over her

ALTER
It’s over now

Beth promptly SPITS in Alter’s face

BETH
Youre a fucking Nazi

After a nerve-wracking beat Alter just calmly wipes her face
with Beth’s gag

ALTER
If you want to live to see your
boyfriend Id advise against
comparing me to the scum that
slaughtered my grandfather

BETH
If the jackboot fits

ALTER
Your hatred is unjustified
EXT HEARST CASTLE - CONTINUING

Alter’s words continue over images of the gas cloud swirling
around the still bodies on the battlefield below

ALTER (VO)
--your true love is only sleeping

Push in on Yorick’s body He’s lying down on his stomach
just outside of the car

ALTER (VO)
Dreaming of you no doubt

But suddenly Yorick’s body begins to MOVE Track over to
his face which we can now see is wearing the familiar GAS
MASK Yorick’s been carrying with him since New York
ALTER (VO)
The boy will be fine in a few
hours

The gasmask-clad Yorick looks around to make sure that no one
is watching before he reaches for one of the fallen Amazons
REVOLVERS He picks it up and triumphantly RISES

ALTER (VO)
And he’1l wake in a much safer
world

Walking into the noxious fog that still lingers over the
grounds Yorick DISAPPEARS

INT HEARST’S PRIVATE SUITE - CONTINUING
Smash cut back to a disbelieving Beth

BETH
What the fuck are you

Alter turns her back on the girl and starts to walk out of
the room

ALTER
Alter Tse’elon

Beth calls after her

BETH
Isn’t that a guy’s name

Alter stops in her tracks She turns to look back at Beth

ALTER
Don’t tell me Yorick found himself
a nice Jewish girl But only half
no Your mother must have found
herself a nice Aryan to settle down
with

BETH
Alter It means “old one” right

Alter approaches her

ALTER
A stupid tradition Two of my
siblings died at birth so when my
parents had me they decided never
to speak my real name aloud
(MORE )

ALTER (contd)
The nickname is meant to deceive
the Angel of Death so that he’1l
never be able to find me

Beth just sneers

BETH
Today’s the day he catches up with
you

A sinisterly smiling Alter gets close to the girl’s face

ALTER
Really Have you guessed my true
name

ANOTHER VOICE (0S)
Yeah It starts with ”“C” and
rhymes with “cunt”

Cut over to the gun-wielding YORICK as he dramatically rips
off his gasmask with his free hand

BETH
YORICK

He confidently aims his weapon at Alter but she immediately
steps behind the still-bound Beth and presses her pearl-
handled DAGGER against the stunned girl’s throat

ALTER
Drop it before I open her

Yorick looks at the revolver in his trembling hand There
are only TWO BULLETS in its chambers What if he misses
Reluctantly Yorick lowers the weapon

YORICK
I’m sorry Beth

BETH
Yorick it’s fine Go get out of
here

YORICK

No not just about this I’m
I’m sorry about before I lied to
you

Beth is confused but Alter’s just impatient

BETH
What
ALTER
This is not fucking couples
therapy

YORICK
I told you I got Ampersand because
I wanted to help people but
really I just wanted to impress
you

BETH
Yorick leave

YORICK
I love you Beth but everything
Ive ever done I’ve done for
myself I don’t know why fate
chose a selfish bastard like me
but she made a huge mistake

ALTER
If you want to help your girl why
the hell are you still talking

YORICK
Because men are only better than
women at one thing

Alter can’t resist

Suddenly Yorick SPINS his revolver’s open wheel before

slamming it shut and PRESSING THE GUN TO HIS OWN TEMPLE

He closes his eyes and plays his first round of Russian

Roulette

CLICK

ALTER
And what might that be

YORICK
This

ALTER
What the fuck are you doing

YORICK
I’m useless to you dead right
Let her go or I punch my own
ticket
ALTER
Youre lying That gun’s even not
loaded You’d never--

Yorick interrupts her by FIRING a shot into the marble floor
Beth and Alter flinch in shock as Yorick again SPINS the
wheel and takes aim at his own skull

YORICK
All it takes is one right

Push in close on the gun as we see the one remaining bullet
start to move into position behind the revolver’s slowly
descending hammer

ALTER
NO

Just as Yorick’s about to squeeze the trigger Alter THROWS
her pearl-handled dagger at his WRIST

As the dagger EMBEDS itself just below Yorick’s hand the
last man DROPS his weapon before it discharges

Alter RUNS for the fallen weapon but Yorick KICKS it away
before she can get her hands on it

As Alter cautiously approaches him Yorick YANKS the dagger
out of his wrist He’s trying to look like a badass as he
wields the blade but the pain is unbearable

YORICK
AHH Holy shit did that hurt

As Yorick continues to brandish the dagger Alter suddenly
CHARGES at him

ALTER
Youve never even met pain

Alter KICKS the knife out of Yorick’s hand before ferociously
HEAD-BUTTING him between the eyes

As a stunned Yorick falls backwards Alter calmly picks up
her dagger tucks it into her belt and heads for the
revolver But just as she’s about to reach this gun Yorick
catches a second wind and DIVES for it The two violently
WRESTLE over the weapon until a SHOT finally rings out

Yorick smiles This is just like what happened with 355 and
the Israeli soldier back in Marrisville right
Wrong A horrified Alter looks down to see the smoking
weapon in her hand and a smoldering hole in Yoricks
shirt just to the left of his belly button

Yorick slumps to the ground and Beth is too shocked to
scream

BETH
(under her breath)
No

A worried Alter stumbles back to Beth The solider DRAWS her
blood-stained dagger Beth flinches but Alter just SLICES
her free of her restraints She points at the fallen Yorick

ALTER
FIX HIM

BETH
I’m I’m not a medic I’m just
a

A furious Alter glares at the girl

BETH
I’1l need your knife

More glaring

BETH
To cut his clothes

Alter reluctantly flips the pearl-handled blade around and
hands it to Beth but not before she AIMS Yorick’s sidearm at
her and takes a defensive position near the room’s one
doorway

ALTER
Don’t fuck up

Beth runs over to Yorick quickly kneeling at his side She
brushes his hair affectionately before she tears into his
shirt with her knife

BETH
(smiling playfully
sarcastic)
My knight in shining armor

YORICK
Right more like your damsel in
distress
As Beth goes to work Yorick whispers to her

YORICK
Listen to me Don’t worry about
Alter That gun is empty now
You have to let me die

BETH
Don’t talk like that

YORICK
The world’s safer without me
Just--

Alter angrily aims her gun at the young lovers

ALTER
STOP FUCKING TALKING One more
word out of either of you and

Just then Alter notices something in one of the

MIRRORS

suite’s many

A figure has silently entered the room behind her

It’s Agent 355 badly wounded but alive

Just as 355 is about to put a silenced bullet in Alter’s
head the Israeli general spins around and KNOCKS the gun out
of her hand

AGENT 355
AHN

Yorick is both excited and frightened to see his friend

YORICK
Three

Alter then KICKS 355 in the stomach sending the secret agent

flying out of the room

Alter runs out after her

Back in the suite Beth is more confused than ever

BETH
Who the hell is that

YORICK

(groggy)
It’s a long

And with that Yorick slips into unconsciousness
INT NORTH WING - CONTINUING

In the opulent north wing just outside this suite Alter
continues to battle Agent 355

355 flicks open her BATON which she SMASHES against Alter’s
right hand causing her to drop her gun Alter then ROUND-
HOUSES the baton away from 355

It’s strictly hand-to-hand and woman-to-woman from here until
the end 355 taunts Alter as she deftly uses her one good
arm to violently SPAR with her opponent

ALTER
Youre the one who killed my girls
Back in Marrisville

AGENT 355
If anyone got them killed it’s

you

Alter charges forward and digs her THUMB into 355’s bullet
wound

AGENT 355
NAHH

355 tries to PUNCH Alter in the kidneys but the Lieutenant-
General dodges the attack and uses 355’s momentum against
her THROWING her over a nearby railing

355 lands on her back with a sickening THUD

Alter looks down at her and without pity proceeds to VAULT
over the railing and POUNCE on 355’s one good arm SNAPPING
it loudly

355 screams as Alter uses that same broken right arm to
painfully DRAG the Culper Ring agent back up the stairs At
the landing Alter then climbs ON TOP of the pained woman

ALTER
Who Who do you work for

355 says nothing so Alter PUNCHES her in the face as hard as
she can Through bloody teeth 355 spits out

AGENT 355
The the Culper Ring

Alter smiles
ALTER
Youre joking I thought your
little sewing circle was just a
myth the drill instructors used to
scare us at boot camp They told
us you were the best of the best

Alter PUNCHES 355 again

ALTER
Tell me what number did your
keepers give you Maybe I’1ll get
it tattooed on my ass

A winded 355 struggles to whisper something inaudible

ALTER
Speak up girl

Alter leans in close as 355 echoes Yorick’s earlier words to
her

AGENT 355
(whispering)
You know what the strongest muscle
is

Before Alter can answer 355 SNAPS her jaws around Alter’s
throat and BITES DOWN as hard as she can

Alter howls a hideous gurgling scream as 355 TEARS OFF a
healthy chunk of her neck

Stumbling away from her defenseless opponent Alter presses a
palm against her own neck to try to stem the horrible tide
pouring out of her opened jugular

With her free hand Alter reaches down to pick up the GUN 355
knocked away earlier She raises her shaky hand to fire a
fatal round down into her opponent’s face

355 squeezes her eyes shut bracing herself for impact
when she hears an unfamiliar SHUNK noise

The Culper Ring agent opens her eyes just in time to watch
Alter fall forward DEAD Sticking out of her back is the
pearl-handled dagger

355 looks up to see a trembling BETH standing over the
deceased soldier

BETH
Are are you all right
Struggling to stay conscious 355 asks

AGENT 355
Yorick Is Yorick

But before she can finish her thought 355’s eyes fall shut

Blackness

WHITE TEXT ON BLACK BACKGROUND

TOMBSTONE ARIZONA TWO WEEKS LATER

INT DR MANN’S NEW LABORATORY - MORNING

Gradually this blackness gives way to the sight of a BLURRY
FIGURE looming overhead

YORICK (0S)
Beth

As the figure racks into focus it turns out that it really
is Beth We’re again seeing the world through Yorick’s
POV

YORICK (0S)
Beth I I had this fucked-up
dream that--

BETH
Doctor He’s awake

Similar framing from Yorick’s bed-ridden point of view but
now Dr Mann appears in frame with Ampersand on her
shoulder

YORICK (0S)
Damn

DR MANN
Nice to see you too dick

Pull out to reveal that we’re inside of Dr Mann’s glistening
new futuristic laboratory where Yorick has apparently been
recuperating

YORICK
How long

DR MANN
A while And then some
YORICK
Are you guys

Mann puts a hand on Beth’s back

DR MANN
Were fine

YORICK
And 355

Low angle on the doorway to this room as a figure carrying a
CANE steps inside

AGENT 355 (0S)
Never better

Change angles to reveal Agent 355 her face badly bruised and
her right arm in a cast She looks like SHIT

Yorick tries to mask his revulsion

YORICK
Let me guess walked into a door

355 holds up her cane

AGENT 355
Don’t cry for me gimp This is
for you Figure you’1ll need it
until your “strength” comes back

She gives the hand-carved walking stick to Yorick who sits
up a bit in his hospital bed

YORICK
Does it have a sword in it

355 just squints at him

YORICK
Somebody gimme the post-game Is
that Israeli woman

AGENT 355
No longer active duty And we had
her troops deported with a little
help from your mother

YORICK
You called my mom
BETH
She’s the one who told us about
this safe house She doesn’t want
the rest of the government knowing
where you are until she’s sure they
can be trusted

YORICK
And the Amazons

DR MANN
Somewhere safe where they can all
be deprogrammed

INT MARRISVILLE PENITENTIARY - AFTERNOON
Open tight on Victoria

VICTORIA
Man can imprison our bodies but he
cannot enslave our minds

Pull out to reveal that Victoria is wearing an ORANGE
JUMPSUIT and she’s addressing a crowd of her FELLOW INMATES
inside of the women’s penitentiary back in Marrisville The
other prisoners cheer with each of Victoria’s declarations

VICTORIA
We are the chosen few who recognize
that the Plague was our
emancipation but we can’t stop
until all our sisters are freed
from the yoke of the past

As the women continue to applaud pan over to SONIA the girl
who tried to seduce Yorick She’s dressed in the uniform of

a PRISON GUARD and as she listens to Victoria speak she
slowly begins to CLAP

INT DR MANN’S NEW LABORATORY - MORNING

Cut back to Yorick exactly where we left him

YORICK
Well at least there’s that

Pull out as Yorick asks a favor from 355 and Mann
YORICK

Hey Doc Three you mind if I have
a moment

Mann looks at Beth for approval and Beth nods The doctor
escorts 355 outside

Yorick reaches for his nearby bag

YORICK
Beth there’s something I need to
ask you

BETH

You’re looking for this right
Beth pulls out Yorick’s RING BOX from her pocket

He just stares at it

YORICK
Oh
BETH
There’s something I have to say
first
YORICK
(nervously)
Okay
BETH

Yorick back in New York what I
was trying to tell you before I
left I I wanted you to know
that I thought we should break up

A beat

YORICK
What

BETH
I’m sorry I was too scared to say
anything I I didn’t want to
hurt you

YORICK
But

BETH
We were going in different
directions Yorick You recognized
it too

Beth hands him the ring She’s starting to cry
BETH
That’s why you tried so hard to
hang on to me because you knew the
world was pulling us apart

YORICK
That was a different world Beth

BETH
Maybe but it would be selfish
and and dishonest to say yes to
the last man when I would have said
no to the man

Now Yorick is tearing up too

YORICK
But I’ve changed since then

BETH
And so have I Look I I don’t
believe in coincidence There’s a
reason my formula worked the way it
did and I have an obligation to
stay here with Dr Mann and help
her find new ways of applying it

Beth lovingly touches Yorick

BETH
And it’s no coincidence that
destiny picked you There’s a
reason you’re still alive and it
wasn’t to save me

YORICK
Then why Why am I here

Beth wipes away Yorick’s tears and kisses him one last time

BETH
Alas poor Yorick that’s the
question that separates the men
from the boys

EXT DR MANN’S NEW LABORATORY - MORNING

Cut outside what appears to be an ordinary FARM somewhere in
the United States as a hi-tech hatch OPENS IN THE EARTH
355 and Dr Mann walk out of it

AGENT 355
You sure you guys will be all right
here on your own

DR MANN
Yeah Yorick’s mother said this old
shelter was designed to house
Congress for fifty years in case
the Y2K bug plunged the country
into chaos Thank Christ for
misplaced paranoia

355 walks over to the parked Yugo and throws her bag in the
passenger seat

AGENT 355
Well I appreciate the parting
gift

DR MANN

Where are you off to 355

AGENT 355
If what you say about the Culper
Ring is true then they might be
responsible for more atrocities
than just this I’m going to find
out what they were and try to make
up for as many as I can

DR MANN
You don’t have to pay for the sins
of the father you know

AGENT 355
All you have to do in life is die
right

DR MANN

I guess ‘cause I’m sure as shit
not filing taxes anymore

The two shake hands before Mann returns to her new home

As 355 finishes loading her stuff into the car the sound of
the hatch re-opening is heard off-screen 355 turns to see
Yorick (cane in hand) with Ampersand on his shoulder

YORICK
What does the hard-as-nails secret
agent suck at good-byes
AGENT 355
Just figured you had more important
things to do down there

YORICK
Actually the doc says she’s gotten
everything important from Amp and
me already She took all the semen
samples she needs while I was out
Not sure I want to know how she
took them but--

AGENT 355
I hope Beth let you down easy

He stares at 355 in disbelief

YORICK
You you knew she was gonna dump
me

AGENT 355

From pretty much the moment you
told me about her yeah

Yorick just kicks at the dirt a bit

YORICK
Why is women’s intuition only right
when it’s too late to do anything
about it

AGENT 355
It’s never too late Yorick I’m
sure you two will work it out

YORICK
Actually I told her I’m leaving

355 stops what she’s doing

AGENT 355
And going where

YORICK
I was kinda hoping to hitch a ride
with you

AGENT 355
Yorick
YORICK
Just hear me out I know you
ladies have the world under
control Beth was telling me the
water’s back on in most cities and
the nuclear power plants are
cooling down and all that but
maybe there’s something out there
that someone still needs a man for

AGENT 355

Like what

YORICK
(a beat)
Opening jars

AGENT 355
Yorick youre safest here

YORICK
You sure about that What if
other villainesses find out
about this place Burn it to the
ground God forbid It’s not smart
to keep all our sperm in one
basket

AGENT 355
(a little disgusted)
You have a way with words

YORICK
Does that mean I can tag along

A long beat

AGENT 355
Why not

As Ampersand scampers into the Yugo’s back seat Yorick
climbs in shotgun 355 takes the wheel

AGENT 355
Buckle up I don’t need the last
man on earth flying through my
windshield

YORICK
Not the last man Three

Yorick pulls out a CD from his bag which he throws in the
car’s sound system
YORICK
Just the only one for now

Jay-Zs “99 Problems” comes to life over the speakers

Agent 355 reaches for the volume and with a little half-
smile turns it up

Were looking at the car from above now as it peels away
from the hidden shelter eventually slowing to stop at a fork
in a clearly Y-SHAPED ROAD

We pull out farther faster and faster high into the AIR
past the CLOUDS past the UPPER ATMOSPHERE until we’re once
again in SPACE taking in the serene blue planet looking
much like it did in the moments before the Plague

But this time a LARGE OBJECT suddenly floats into frame

INT INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION - NOW

Push in through one of the space station’s tiny windows to
reveal a FEMALE ASTRONAUT the one we heard come over the
NASA Ground Control speaker during the opening Plague
montage

This woman’s checking a complicated control panel

FEMALE ASTRONAUT
That’s it The Elektron’s gone
from working intermittently to
belching hydrogen into the cabin
Even the HAM radio’s dead

ANOTHER VOICE (0S)
Then the decision’s been made for
us

Finally cut over to two MALE ASTRONAUTS a bearded RUSSIAN
COSMONAUT and the handsome AFRICAN-AMERICAN TEAM LEADER
hovering in the weightless environment across from their
female colleague
