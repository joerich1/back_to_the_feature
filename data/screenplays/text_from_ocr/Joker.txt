JOKER

an origin

written by

Todd Phillips and Scott Silver

13 April 2018
This story takes place in its own universe It has no
connection to any of the DC films that have come before it

We see it as a classic Warner Bros movie Gritty intimate
and oddly funny the characters live in the real world and
the stakes are personal

Although it is never mentioned in the film this story takes
place in the past

Lets call it 1981

Its a troubled time The crime rate in Gotham is at record
highs A garbage strike has crippled the city for the past
six weeks And the divide between the haves and the have-
nots is palpable Dreams are beyond reach slipping into
delusions

TPSS
OVER BLACK
HEAR LAUGHTER
The sound of a man totally cracking up

FADE IN

INT DEPT OF HEALTH OFFICE - MORNING 1

CLOSE ON JOKER (30s) tears in his eyes from laughing so
hard Hes trying to get it under control His greasy black
hair is matted down Hes wearing an old faded red hooded
zip-up sweatshirt a threadbare gray scarf thin from years
of use hangs loosely around his neck

WE NOTICE TWO FADED OLD SCARS cut at the corners of his
mouth Almost forming a smile

Hes sitting across from an overworked SOCIAL WORKER (50s)
African American Her office is cramped and run-down in a
cramped and run-down building Stacks of folders piled high
in front of her

She just sits behind her desk waiting for his laughing fit
to end shes been through this before Finally it subsides

Joker takes a deep breath pauses to see if its over
Beat

JOKER
--is it just me or is it getting
crazier out there

Despite the laughter theres real pain in his eyes
Something broken in him Looks like he hasnt slept in days

SOCIAL WORKER

Its certainly tense People are
upset theyre struggling Looking
for work The garbage strike seems
like its been going on forever
These are tough times

(then)
How bout you Hows the job Still
enjoying it

JOKER
Yeah I mean its different each
day so I really like that I dont
think I could ever work in an
office Behind a desk

(MORE )
JOKER (CONTD)
(beat)
No offense

She smiles Writes something down Looks at the clock shes
running late for her next appointment

SOCIAL WORKER
Have you been keeping up with your
journal

JOKER
Everyday

SOCIAL WORKER
Great Did you bring it with you

Beat

JOKER
(dodging the subject)
Im sorry Did I bring what

SOCIAL WORKER
(impatient she doesnt
have time for this)
Arthur last time I asked you to
bring your journal with you For
these appointments Do you have it

JOKER
Yes maam

Beat

SOCIAL WORKER
Can I see it

He reluctantly reaches into his bag Pulls out a weathered
notebook Slides it across to her--

JOKER
Ive been using it as a journal
but also a joke diary Funny
thoughts or or observations-- Did
I tell you Im pursuing a career in
stand-up comedy

Shes half-listening as she flips through his journal

SOCIAL WORKER
No You didnt

JOKER
I think I did
She doesnt respond keeps flipping through his journal--

SOCIAL WORKER
Oh yeah Because of what your
mother said-- about your purpose
To bring laughter and joy to the
world right

JOKER
Right

ANGLE ON JOURNAL pages and pages of notes all in neat
angry-looking handwriting Also cut out photos from hardcore
pornographic magazines and some crude handmade drawings

A flash of anger crosses Jokers face We see him picking at
his right eyebrow almost obsessively Trying to stay calm
His eyebrow is actually half-gone Something he does a lot

JOKER
I didnt realize you wanted to read
it

The social worker gives him a look then reads something in
the pages that gives her pause

SOCIAL WORKER
(reading out loud)
I just hope my death makes more
sense than my life

She looks up at Joker He just stares back Lets it hang out
there for a beat

Then he laughs a little even though he doesnt think its
funny--

JOKER
Yeah I mean thats just--

SOCIAL WORKER
Does my reading it upset you

He leans in
JOKER
No I just-- some of its
personal You know
SOCIAL WORKER
I understand I just want to make

sure youre keeping up with it

She slides his journal back to him He holds it in his lap
SOCIAL WORKER
What about your mom Hows she
feeling

JOKER
She has good days But mostly bad
Its been a big help having me
there She really needs me

SOCIAL WORKER
Seems like shes been sick a lot
since you got home

JOKER
(nods )
Yeah its good Im there When I
was in the hospital after my last
episode-- she was having trouble
getting over there to visit

She looks back up at the clock she needs to get to her next
appointment

SOCIAL WORKER
All right So Ill see you again
two weeks from today

He nods But keeps sitting there for a moment
She stands up trying to signal its time for him to leave--

SOCIAL WORKER
Is there something else I can help
you with Arthur My next
appointment is waiting

He just keeps sitting there

JOKER
Yeah I was wondering if you could
ask the doctor to increase the
dosage on my medications Nothing
seems to make a difference

SOCIAL WORKER
(looking over his record)
Do you know which ones youd like
increased

Shakes his head no

SOCIAL WORKER
Have you been sleeping
JOKER
(lying)
Some

She glances at his file again
SOCIAL WORKER
Arthur youre on seven different
medications Surely they must be
doing something

He finally stands up Zips up his faded red sweatshirt

Looks at her--

JOKER
I just dont wanna feel so bad
anymore

TITLE
JOKER
EXT GOTHAM SQUARE MIDTOWN - KENNYS MUSIC SHOP - DAY 2

GOTHAM SQUARE IS CLOGGED WITH TRAFFIC Non-stop honking
horns pedestrians crowding the sidewalk Huge billboards
giant movie marquees garbage bags piled high everywhere
Underneath it all we hear a TINKLING PIANO playing something
bouncy and fast-paced

FROM ACROSS THE BUSY CITY STREET we see Joker Hes dressed
as a sad-faced HOBO CLOWN This is his job

Dressed in tattered clothes dark five oclock shadow painted
on his face big bulbous red nose his mouths outlined in
white turned down at the corners

Hes holding up a sign in front of Kennys Music Shop that
reads EVERYTHING MUST GO A banner above the store reads
GOING OUT OF BUSINESS Behind him an OLD MAN plays a piano
on the street Both of them there to draw attention to the
big sale going on in the store

Jokers doing a little Charlie Chaplin like waddle to the
music Most people walk right past ignoring him A few bump
into him by mistake

JOKER SEES A GROUP OF FIVE BOYS no more than 15-years-old
walking toward him He moves out of their way They crack up
laughing when they see him Start making fun of him

Joker ignores them tries to do his job the best he can while
maintaining some dignity Keeps dancing and holding up the
sign

One of the kids knocks the sign out of Jokers hands--

KID 1
Suck my dick clown

The kids laugh Joker doesnt say anything Just bends over
to pick up the sign--

Another kid kicks him in the ass--

KID 2
Whoops

Joker falls face first onto the sidewalk Oddly the old man
playing the piano picks up the pace of the music--

The kids crack up One of the boys grabs Jokers sign and
takes off running across the street--

The other kids follow weaving through traffic-—-

Joker gets up and gives chase He needs his sign back

He almost gets hit by a taxi spinning out of the way just in
time-- Spinning right into another taxi that stops just short
of hitting him

Joker keeps running through traffic People stare A clown
barreling down the street has got to be a joke--

EXT CORNER SIDE STREET - GOTHAM SQUARE - CONTINUOUS 3
The five boys are booking it down the crowded street laughing
and whooping it up At the last second they take a sharp

right turn down a cross street-—-

Joker almost overshoots the corner slip-sliding in his big
red shoes--

He rights himself and heads down after them--
Sees them running up ahead--

WHAP Out of nowhere Joker gets hit in the face
He falls to the ground

One of the kids was hiding between parked cars and hit Joker
with the EVERYTHING MUST GO sign splintering it in two--
The other kids turn back and walk up to Joker down on the
ground

Joker reaches out still trying to save the sign--

THE KIDS START KICKING AND BEATING THE SHIT out of Joker
Its brutal and vicious Nobody on the street stops to help

CLOSE ON JOKERS HOBO CLOWN FACE down on the ground Sweat
running down his face smearing his make-up He doesnt even
look like hes in pain He just takes the beating

That stupid frown painted on his face

INT CITY BUS (PULLING OUT) - HEADING DOWNTOWN - DUSK 4

Joker makes his way toward the back of the crowded bus now
walking with a slight limp but keeping his head held high

His make-ups washed off costume and props all shoved into a
big shopping bag slung over his shoulder Some white grease-
paint still smudged on the sides of his face

He finds an empty seat in the back of the bus Sees a sad-

eyed FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL face puffy from crying sitting on
her knees looking back at him Her mothers facing forward
but even from behind you can tell shes angry

Joker sees the sad-eyed girl staring straight back at him He
doesnt know where to look feeling self-conscious and small
He gets back into character smiling like a clown and covers
his face with his hands-- Starts playing the peek-a-boo game
with her

The girl stares back at him for a moment then giggles-—-

WOMAN ON BUS
(turns back to Joker
already annoyed)
Can you please stop bothering my
kid

JOKER
I wasnt bothering her I was--

WOMAN ON BUS
(interrupts)
Just stop

AND SUDDENLY JOKER STARTS TO LAUGH LOUD He covers his mouth
trying to hide it-- Shakes his head laughter pausing for a
moment but then it comes on stronger His eyes are sad It
actually looks like the laughter causes him pain
People on the bus are staring The girl looks like shes
going to cry again

WOMAN ON BUS
You think thats funny

Joker shakes his head no but he cant stop laughing He
reaches in his pocket and pulls out a small card Hands it to
the woman

CLOSE ON THE CARD it reads Forgive my laughter I have a
condition (more on back)

She turns the card over and there is a bunch of information
in small writing--

Its a medical condition causing sudden frequent uncontrollable laughter that
doesn’t match how you feel It can happen in people with a brain injury or certain

neurological conditions

She doesnt read it (but if you freeze frame the movie you
could) She just shakes her head annoyed and throws the card
on the ground

Joker laughs harder Tears running down his face

Not wanting to attract any more attention to himself he
pulls up his red hood and uses his threadbare scarf to cover
his mouth trying to muffle the laughter

He looks out at the city passing him by

EXT LOWER EAST SIDE STREETS - GOTHAM - EVENING 5
The bus pulls away sun almost gone

Joker heads slowly down the litter-covered streets Garbage
is piled along the sidewalks the air thick with smog creates
a haze over everything

The streets are crowded with the poor the elderly and
disenfranchised Women with children in busted strollers
Homeless people sleeping on subway grates Stray dogs His is
one of the few white faces

Joker makes his way into a run-down drug store behind him
two drunks fight on the corner beating the shit out of each
other Joker and nobody else for that matter pays them any
attention

No one here gives a shit
INT LOBBY APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING 6

A shabby lobby in a building that was once probably pretty
nice but now its a dump

(prescription) bag in his hand

The mailbox is empty

INT ELEVATOR APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 7

Joker steps onto the wheezing elevator harsh fluorescent
lights graffiti on the walls As the door closes he hears--

SOPHIE (0S)

door-- Hes a romantic at heart Ding

And SOPHIE DUMOND (late 20s) tired eyes hands filled with
grocery bags steps onto the elevator with GIGI her 5-year-
old daughter

SOPHIE
Thank you
(realizing)
Of course it’s you-- everyone else
in this building is just so fucking
rude

Joker nods thanks Holds his breath hoping he doesnt
start to laugh

Floors dinging as the elevator rises

Joker sees GiGi licking the dirty smudged elevator handrail
behind her mom

SOPHIE

He takes a deep breath hes uncomfortable talking to her
holds up the white prescription bag

JOKER
Its day to day I’m doing
everything I can to get her back on
her feet
(re pharmacy bag)
Picked up her medicine Gonna make
her some dinner

SOPHIE
(smiles being polite)
She’s lucky she has you--

Joker smiles thanks cant help but glance at GiGi licking
the rail

Sophie finally notices She wants to grab her but cant with
her hands full Tries to kick her away--

SOPHIE
Jesus Don’t do that GiGi How
many times have I told you that
(to Joker)
This building is so awful isn’t
it

Joker just nods he doesnt know what to say but clearly
wants to continue this conversation with Sophie

The doors open They all step off
SOPHIE
Okay Well tell your mom I said
hello

And Sophie and GiGi walk down the hall-- the opposite way of
Joker He just stands there for a beat Heart beating fast

JOKER
(calls out after her)
Hey Sophie--

She turns around

JOKER

She smiles as in yeah that’s what I said

INT MOMS APARTMENT FRONT DOOR - EVENING 8

and swoons Hears a deep purring sound He looks down and

Then--

calls out)

Joker any attention

Joker pauses half-finished and stares at himself for a beat
He starts to examine the two small scars on the corners of
his mouth we really notice how they form a smile Joker
hooks the corners of his mouth down with his index fingers
turning his smile into a frown--

He lets go and his smile returns

Does it again up and down up and down his face a living
comedytragedy mask

And then he pulls his fingers wider stretching his smile
into a grotesque parody pulling his mouth so wide tears come
to his eyes--

AND WE HEAR JOKER SINGING If Youre Happy and You Know It

face still painted his bag on the seat next to him along
with his wig

Theres only one other person on the subway car a YOUNG
WOMAN (30s) sitting at the far end-- reading a book

The train comes to a stop and THREE WALL STREET GUYS enter
They are being loud and obnoxious clearly drunk One of them
is eating some french fries out of a greasy McDonalds bag
He flops down on the bench across from the girl and checks
her out The other two guys start getting into it with each
other--

WALL STREET 1
--Im telling you she wanted my
number We should have just stayed

The train starts moving again
WALL STREET 2

Youre dreaming man She wasnt
interested-- at all

WALL STREET 1

we were dancing She was in love
bro

He starts dancing a bit with himself mimicking what he
remembers Wall Street 2 takes a swig from the brown bag he
is carrying

WALL STREET 2
She couldnt wait to get away from
you

Joker is watching them closely impressed by their confidence
and easy-going camaraderie

WALL STREET 1
(to the third guy)
Ryan am I crazy Tell him what you
saw

But the third Wall Street guy isnt paying his friends any
attention He has his eyes set on the young woman sitting
across from him reading her book

WALL STREET 3
(to the girl)
Hey You want some french fries

He holds out his McDonalds bag and shakes it to get her
attention The other two share a look Joker watches from his
seat

WALL STREET 3
Hello Im talking to you You want
some fries

She looks up and shakes her head polite smile

YOUNG WOMAN
No thank you

The other two guys crack up at this apparent blow-off The
third Wall Street guy shakes his head embarrassed and
starts softly flinging fries at the young woman

WALL STREET 3
You sure Theyre really good

She just buries her face deeper in her book--

WALL STREET 2
Dont ignore him Hes being nice
to you

One of the french fries lands in her hair She looks down
toward Joker looking to see if hes going to do something or
say something--

Joker just sits there nervous Not sure what to do or even
if he wants to do anything at all

AND HE JUST BURSTS OUT LAUGHING He covers his mouth with his
hand as they continue to harass the woman

They all look over-- What the fuck is this clown laughing at

WALL STREET 1
Something funny asshole

With their attention diverted the young woman rushes out
through the door between subway cars glancing back at Joker
before she goes--

WALL STREET 3
(shouts after her)
BITCH

Joker laughs even harder through his hand The Wall Street
guys turn to him sitting by himself at the end of the car--

Joker sees them staring Looks down at the ground hand still
covering his mouth face turning red Subway swaying lights
flickering on and off

Beat

One of the guys heads down the car toward Joker starts
singing Send in the Clowns as he approaches--

WALL STREET 1
(singing)
Isnt it rich

The others crack up and follow after him The guy plops down
next to Joker puts his arm around his shoulder as he sings--

JOKER
(shakes his head stifling
the laughter)

(continues singing to him)
Isnt it bliss
Dont you approve
One who keeps tearing around
One who cant move

Joker starts to get up-- The lead guy pulls him back down

WALL STREET 1
Where are the clowns
There ought to be clowns

As he finishes the song Jokers laughing fit is coming to an
end One of the other guys sits down on the other side of
him Hes now sandwiched in between them--

WALL STREET 2
So tell us buddy Whats so

JOKER

Joker reaches into his bag to get one of his Forgive my
laughter cards the third guy sees him reaching and tries to
grab the bag from him---

Joker pulls on it--

JOKER

The guy rips the bag from his hand--
WALL STREET 3

Joker gets up from between them to go grab his bag back The
two guys are cracking up

WALL STREET 3

Joker reaches out to grab the bag--

And the guy tosses it over his head to one of his friends
Keeping it away from Joker

Three guys in suits tossing a bag around playing monkey in
the middle with a clown THE LIGHTS ON THE TRAIN SEEM TO
GLOW BRIGHTER AND WE HEAR the drum roll opening to BOBBY
SHORT singing Send in the Clowns Live at the Café Carlyle

Joker keeps trying to catch his bag until suddenly--

WHAP Out of nowhere one of the guys punches him hard in the
face

Joker goes down as if in slow motion Blood coming from his
nose He tries to get up but his feet slip from under him
and he falls back down--

WALL STREET 1
Stay down you freak

And the third Wall Street guy starts kicking him--

The others join in Surrounding Joker on the ground kicking
him deliberately sadistically and the music swells--

BLAM

SUDDENLY THE LIGHTS GO BACK DIM and one of the guys stops
kicking and falls back dead Blood splattering on the subway
wall behind him--

And we HEAR Bobby Short sing out picking up from where the
Wall Street Guy left off--

ee

BOBBY SHORT (SINGING)
Just when Id stopped opening doors
Finally knowin the one that I
wanted was yours

BLAM BLAM Wall Street 2 goes down--

Revealing Joker on the ground opening his eyes to see what
he did smoking gun in his hand--

BOBBY SHORT (SINGING)
Making my entrance again with my
usual flair
Sure of my lines
No one is there

The third guy takes off running for the doors that separate
the cars

Joker starts after him but then stops turns back to grab
his bag and his wig his hands shaking from the adrenaline

The train is coming to a stop
BOBBY SHORT (SINGING)
Dont you love farce

My fault I fear

Joker picks up his bag between the two dead bodies blood
everywhere

The subway doors wheeze open and Joker steps halfway off the
train waiting to see if the third Wall Street guy gets off
in the car ahead of him Joker sees him run off--

EXT SUBWAY PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS 38

The platform is empty the Wall Street guy is running toward
the stairs--

Joker nods not hating the idea

JOKER

A small smirk registers on Jokers face when photos of the
THREE WALL STREET GUYS come up on the screen

THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV)
And while I didnt know them
personally like all Wayne
employees past and present they
were family

Jokers mom perks up at that--

GOOD MORNING HOST (ON TV)
There now seems to be a groundswell
of anti-rich sentiment in the city
Its almost as if our less
fortunate residents have taken the
side of the killer

THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV)
Yes and its a shame Its one of
the reasons Im considering a run
for mayor Gotham has lost its way

GOOD MORNING HOST (ON TV)
Are you announcing your candidacy

THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV)
(smiles)
No comment

We hear his mother gasp excited

GOOD MORNING HOST (ON TV)
What about the eyewitness report of
the suspect being a man in clown
make-up or a clown mask-- Care to
comment on that

Joker leans in intrigued The camera zooms in closer to
Thomas Wayne on the screen

THOMAS WAYNE (ON TV)
It makes total sense to me What
kind of coward would do something
that cold-blooded Someone who
hides behind a mask Someone whos
envious of those more fortunate
than themselves yet too scared to
show their own face

(to camera)

And until that jealousy ends those
of us whove made a good life for
ourselves will always look at those

who havent as nothing but clowns

Joker walking along an intimidating wrought iron fence
surrounding the estate like prison bars the brown paper
shopping bag stuffed under his arm The big house set up a
small hill evergreens dot the lush grounds As he walks
around looking for the front entrance Joker catches a
glimpse of an innocent looking EIGHT-YEAR-OLD BOY tracking
him from behind the trees hiding as he follows

Joker stops
He sees the boy stop behind a tree

Joker continues walking until he gets to the front gate He
digs into his bag and pulls out the magic wand--

He holds it up for the boy to see

The boy steps out from behind a tree to get a closer look
Joker puts the brown bag down on the ground looks over the
wand pretending like hes trying to figure out what it does

He waves the wand over the front gate lock to try and see
if it will open-- It doesnt

The little boy walks down toward the fence face like an
angel

Joker waits until he gets closer and then reaches his hand
through the fence and hands the kid his magic wand so he can
try and figure out what it does--

The boy takes the wand and it goes limp in his hand before he
can wave it-- He laughs surprised He hands it back to
Joker

The boys sees Jokers face up close staring at his scarred
smile--

Joker straightens the wand back out and reaches in through
the fence again so the kid can give it another try

AND AGAIN THE MAGIC WAND DROOPS IN THE BOYS HAND He laughs
and gives it back to Joker--

Joker examines the wand as if its broken stiffens it one
last time crouches down lower and

Ta-da A bouquet of flowers bursts out the end of the wand--
Joker smiles and hands him the wand bouquet of flowers--

The little boy takes the flowers Keeps staring at Joker at
the scars around his mouth

Now he reaches his hand out through the fence and touches
Jokers face tracing his finger around the edges of Jokers
mouth over his scarred smile--

Joker closes his eyes -- embarrassed -- but it feels good to
him nobody ever touches him besides his mother

He starts to smile when a mans voice shatters the moment--

ALFRED (0S)
(shouting slight English
accent)

The little boy pulls his hand back Turns and runs away--

Joker looks up and sees a balding tired-looking ALFRED

EXT ARKHAM STATE HOSPITAL - MORNING 76

A GRAY BEHEMOTH STATE HOSPITAL looming over the city block
Metal screens cover steel-framed windows Joker crosses the
street toward the building eyes weary he hasnt slept in

HE SEES TWO GOTHAM CITY COPS AND A PARAMEDIC rolling a gurney
into the entrance a naked sunburned man screaming his
head off is handcuffed to the stretcher underneath a white
sheet Joker follows them inside

INT ARKHAM STATE HOSPITAL - ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE - MORNING

Joker sits waiting in a cramped office looking out a
plexiglass window that overlooks the crowded hallway--

A constant din of people moving about talking and shouting
Patients handcuffed to the armrests of their wheelchairs
lying on stretchers heads covered with pillowcase turbans or
forearms to block out the harsh fluorescent lights

His gaze is interrupted by a CLERK (40s) ID clipped to his
shirt whos lugging an old heavy file storage box

He drops the box down on his messy desk with a thud

CLERK
Sorry for the wait All our records
that are 10 years or older are
stored in the basement Youre

to do some serious digging

Joker nods thanks

CLERK

The clerk opens the file box Starts digging though it Joker
stares out the plexiglass window that faces the hallway--

JOKER

He pulls out an old file bulging with yellowing records
Moves the box to the floor and sits down at his desk

JOKER

himself to hear)

The guy opens the file Yellowing pages of her records--

CLERK

(nods skim-reading)

The clerk stops reading out loud eyes going wide as he skims
further ahead Joker just looks at the guy waiting to see

The clerk puts the file down on his desk--
CLERK

Joker just sits there thinking it all over for a moment
Then snatches the file off the clerks desk--
The clerk grabs it as well
They play tug-of-war with the file its awkward and goes on

way too long Finally Joker shoves the guy hard and pulls
the file away--

He takes off running out of the office with it The clerk
watches for a beat but does nothing

he can react The sound is sickening Garys screaming in the
background--

Randall blindly fights back screaming in pain flailing his
arms his own blood blinding him--

Joker grabs Randall by the head -- all of his pent up rage
and frustration pouring out of him -- AND SLAMS HIS HEAD
AGAINST THE WALL

AGAIN And AGAIN And AGAIN

Joker lets go of Randalls head and Randall drops to the
ground Joker leans back against the wall out of breath
kind of slides down the wall to the floor--

Sees Gary huddled in the corner trembling with fear--

moment breathing heavy wipes Randalls blood off his face--

Joker turns sees Gary at the front door He points up high
to the chain-lock He cant reach it

Joker just shakes his head to himself and gets up to unlock

down the hall toward the drab dressing rooms with his old-
school producer GENE UFLAND (60s) whos holding the shows
rundown rolled up in his hand

GENE UFLAND

the protestor footage of the City Hall rally clashes with
police

Hes cleaned himself up as best he could white grease-
paint smeared more evenly over his face green dyed hair
slicked back in place Red lips redone

Murray and his producer Gene open the dressing room door
without knocking--

handcuffed in the back of the squad car moving slowly through

the rioting sirens wailing red lights flashing blood still
splattered on his face

one hand free handcuffs dangling from his other hand Hear
sirens in the distance--

JOKER LEANS BACK AGAINST THE CAR his face bloody his body
broken from the crash Sitting there amongst the wreckage

room Joker imagined his mother was in some 30 years ago The
room and the doctor also look vaguely similar to the social
worker and her office in the opening scene

The doctor just sits there waiting for him to stop laughing
A weathered notebook is on the table in front of him
Finally Joker stops himself

HOSPITAL DOCTOR
Whats so funny

He takes a deep breath his eyes are glazed over His voice
is scratchy like he doesnt use it much
