of innumerable birds TWEETING TWITTERING CAWING as Melanie
and Mrs MacGruder go to the counter at the far end There

is a circular cage in the center of the room and the walls
are lined with wire-mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so
that the effect is one of being surrounded by birds contained
birds to be sure The birds are quite beautiful mostly exotic
birds small splashes of color behind the wire-mesh cages
larger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets

in the bigger cages As they walk

BARKING again as the front door opens Melanie looks up

her and unknown to her he turns for a second look -- and

Annie rises to greet her As Melanie ENTERS THE SHOT

ANNIE
Hi
(seeing her face)

(touching her head)
No its not the cut thats bothering

ANNIE
(concerned)

A quilt

As Annie gets the brandy

MELANIE
No thank you
(pause)

ANNIE

(she smiles)

MED SHOT - MELANIE sitting tucking her legs up under her
She is disturbed by her conversation with Mitch and in fact
by the way this entire trip has worked out Annie brings her
the glass of brandy and she takes it gratefully

MELANIE
Thank you

ANNIE
(sitting opposite her)
It gets a little chilly here at night
sometimes Especially if youre over
near the bay

Melanie nods and sips at the brandy There is a long pause

ANNIE
Well howd your evening go

Melanie shrugs

ANNIE
Did you meet Lydia

Melanie nods

ANNIE
Or would you rather I changed the
subject

MELANIE
(with a tired smile)
I think so

ANNIE
(nodding)
How do you like our little hamlet

MELANIE
I despise it
ANNIE
(laughing)

Well I dont suppose it offers much
to the casual visitor Unless youre
thrilled by a collection of shacks
on a hillside It takes a while to
get used to

MELANIE
Where are you from originally Annie

ANNIE
San Francisco

MELANIE
Howd you happen to come here

ANNIE
Oh someone invited me up for the
weekend a long time ago

There is an awkward pause Annie shrugs

ANNIE
Look I see no reason for being coy
about this It was Mitch Brenner

Melanie nods

ANNIE
I guess you knew that anyway

MELANIE
I suspected as much

ANNIE
You neednt worry Its over and
done with A long time ago

MELANIE
Annie -- theres nothing between
Mitch and me

ANNIE

Isnt there

(she shrugs)
Maybe there isnt Maybe theres
never anything between Mitch and any
girl

MELANIE
What do you mean

ANNIE

I think Ill have some of that too

(she pours brandy

drinks sighs)
I was seeing quite a lot of him in
San Francisco you know

(she smiles weakly)
And then one weekend he asked me
up to meet Lydia

MELANIE
When was this

ANNIE
Four years ago Of course that was
shortly after his father died Things
may be different now

MELANIE
Different
ANNIE
With Lydia
(pause)

Did she seem a trifle distant

MELANIE
(smiling)
A trifle

ANNIE
Then maybe it isnt different at
all You know her attitude nearly
drove me crazy I simply couldnt
understand it

ANNIE
When I got back to San Francisco I
spent days trying to figure out just
what Id done to displease her

MELANIE
And what had you done

ANNIE

Nothing I simply existed So what
was the answer A jealous woman
right A clinging possessive mother

(she shakes her head)
Wrong With all due respect to
Oedipus I dont think that was the
case at all

MELANIE
Then what was it

ANNIE
Lydia liked me you see That was
the strange part of it In fact now
that Im no longer a threat were
very good friends

MELANIE
Then why did she object to you

ANNIE
Because she was afraid

MELANIE
Afraid youd take Mitch

ANNIE
Afraid Id give Mitch

MELANIE
I dont understand

ANNIE
Afraid of any woman whod give Mitch
the only thing Lydia can give him --
love

MELANIE
Annie that adds up to a jealous
possessive woman

ANNIE
No I dont think so Shes not afraid
of losing her son you see Shes

only afraid of being abandoned

MELANIE
Someone ought to tell her shed be
gaining a daughter

ANNIE
She already has a daughter

MELANIE
What about Mitch Didnt he have
anything to say about this

ANNIE
(apologetically)
I can understand his position He
went through a lot with Lydia after
his father died He didnt want to
risk going through it all over again

MELANIE
I see

ANNIE
So it ended Not immediately of
course I went back to San Francisco
and I still saw Mitch every now and
then but we both knew it was
finished

MELANIE
Then what are you doing here in Bodega
Bay

ANNIE
You get straight to the point dont
you

MELANIE
m sorry Forgive me

ANNIE

No thats all right I dont mind
came up here for two reasons To
begin with I was bored with my job
in San Francisco I was teaching at
a private school there well you
now you probably went to one
yourself

MELANIE
did

ANNIE
Then you know Little girls in brown
beanies Deadly Here I have a life
ll go into that classroom on Monday
morning and Ill look out at twenty-
five upturned little faces and each
of them will be saying Yes please
give me what you have

(pause)
And Ill give them what I have I
havent got very much but Ill give
them every ounce of it To me thats
very important It makes me want to
stay alive for a long long time

(she sighs)
Thats the first reason

fq

MELANIE
And the second

ANNIE
(simply)
I wanted to be near Mitch
(pause)
It was over and I knew it but I
wanted to be near him anyway

(she smiles)
You see I still like him a hell of
a lot Thats rare I think I dont
want to lose his friendship ever

There is a moment of silence Into the silence the TELEPHONE
shrills Annie hesitates a moment and then goes to answer
it

ANNIE

Melanie rises and goes to the phone The CAMERA FOLLOWS Annie
to the wing chair in the foreground and stays on her
throughout following recording her reactions as Melanie
talks to Mitch in the background

Annie is not devastated by this call and yet there is a
wistfulness to her expression as she realizes she may finally
and irrevocably be losing Mitch to another girl

MELANIE

(at phone coolly)

MITCH
It smelled of the fire

MELANIE
(nodding)
Its hard to believe anything at all
happened yesterday isnt it Its
so beautiful and still now
(pause then sagely)
I think Ive got it all figured out
by the way

MITCH
Really Tell me about it

MELANIE
(secretively)
Its an uprising

MITCH
Of birds

MELANIE
Certainly of birds

Mitch grins

MELANIE
It all started several months ago
with a peasant sparrow up in the
hills a malcontent He went around
telling all the other sparrows that
human beings werent fit to rule
this planet preaching wherever anyone
would listen

MITCH
Growing a beard

MELANIE
(delighted)
Yes of course he had to have a
beard Birds of the world unite
he kept saying over and over

MITCH
So they united

MELANIE
Not at first Oh yes a few sparrows
out for kicks

MITCH
Well theyll go along with anything

MELANIE
Sure But eventually even the more
serious-minded birds began to listen
Why should humans rule they asked
themselves
MITCH
Hear

MELANIE
Why should we submit ourselves to
their domination

MITCH
Hear hear

MELANIE
And all the while that sparrow was
getting in his little messages
Birds of the world unite

MITCH
Take wing
MELANIE
You have nothing to lose but your

feathers

They both burst out laughing then fall into silence then
laugh again and finally are silent The garden is deathly
still

MITCH
(attempting to be
serious)
What it was probably

MELANIE
Mmm

MITCH
Theyre probably hungry thats all
This was a bad summer They eat
berries and and nuts you know
and the hills are all burned out so
theyre probably searching for food
wherever they can get it

MELANIE
With my little sparrow leading team

She laughs and Mitch joins her but it is hollow this time
Like children who have told themselves a too realistic horror
story they are becoming a little frightened

MITCH
Its so damn quiet out there
MELANIE
It was like that yesterday

MITCH
What do you mean

MELANIE
After the gulls attacked

MITCH
I hadnt thought of that
(pause)
And then the swifts came

MELANIE

theyre waiting or resting
Or

(trying to make it

light again)
No theyre having a meeting Melanie
Your sparrow is standing on a soap
box and

His voice trails His face becomes serious too Again the
garden is silent

INT THE TIDES - FULL SHOT

It is lunchtime and there is a busy bustle to the place as
DEKE CARTER officiates behind the bar and HELEN CARTER his
wife rushes back and forth between diners at the tables A
DRUNK sits at the bar old grizzled the weary wisdom of
booze in him In one of the booths sits SEBASTIAN SHOLES in
his shirt sleeves eating a hurried lunch quickly and
efficiently A WOMAN and TWO CHILDREN are seated at another
table about to order A party of noisy SALESMAN is laughing
and clowning around throughout following at a table in the
rear The phone from behind the bar has been placed on the
counter and Melanie is speaking into it while Deke listens
Over her head the television set is blasting with its
perennial Western the gun shots punctuating her conversation

MELANIE

Daddy there were hundreds of them
No Im not hysterical Im trying
to tell you this as calmly as I know
how All right Daddy Yes Daddy

(she takes a deep

breath)
Just now Not fifteen minutes
ago

The door to the Tides opens and MRS BUNDY sixtyish wearing
walking shoes and a tweed suit a very masculine-looking
woman with short clipped white hair comes in passes through
foreground goes to bar her attention slowly caught by what
Melanie is saying

MELANIE
At the school No I dont Just a
minute
(to Deke)

DEKE
Just the Bodega Bay School
(to Mrs Bundy)
Help you Mrs Bundy

MRS BUNDY

As Deke opens cash register

MELANIE
The Bodega Bay School
(to Deke)
Could you turn that down please

Deke gives Mrs Bundy her change turns off television

MELANIE
I dont know how many children
Thirty or forty Yes

Mrs Bundy goes to cigarette machine pauses to listen to
Melanie

MELANIE
No the birds didnt attack until
the children were outside the school
Crows I think I dont know Daddy
Is there a difference between crows
and blackbirds

MRS BUNDY
(turning from machine)
There is very definitely a difference
Miss

MELANIE

Theyre different Daddy

(to Mrs Bundy)

Thank you

(into phone)

I think these were crows Yes

hundreds of them Yes they attacked

the children attacked them
(exasperated)

Daddy a little girl was sent to the

hospital in Santa Rosa Well all

(pause)

No I cant come home now I just

(pause)

I dont know when I simply cant

She hangs up Mrs Bundy is at her elbow

MRS BUNDY

species The crow is brachyrhynchos
The blackbird is cyanocephalus

MELANIE
Thank you
(to Deke)
Do you know Dan Fawcetts number

DEKE
In the book right here Miss

As Melanie looks it up

DEKE
(to Mrs Bundy)
I dont see what difference it makes
Mrs Bundy crows or blackbirds If
they attacked the school thats
pretty serious

MRS BUNDY
(with a superior smile)
I hardly think either species would
have the intelligence to launch a
massed attack Their brain pans arent
large enough for such

MELANIE
(dialing)
I just came from the school madam
I dont know about their brain pans
but

MRS BUNDY
Birds are not aggressive creatures
Miss They bring beauty to the world
It is mankind rather who

Thus saith the Lord God to the

LITTLE GIRL

HELEN

LITTLE BOY

BACK TO SCENE

SAMS VOICE
(leaving table coming

to bar)
A whole flock of gulls nearby capsized
one of my boats Practically tore

of the skippers arm

HELEN
(coming back)
Youre scaring the kids Keep it
low

DEKE
Youre scaring me too Are you trying
to say all these
(he shakes his head)
That sounds impossible Sebastian

SHOLES
Im only telling you what happened
to my boat

MRS BUNDY

The gulls were after your fish Mr
Sholes Really lets be logical
about this

MELANIE
What were the crows after at the
school

MRS BUNDY
What do you think they were after
Miss

MELANIE
Daniels I think they were after the
children

MRS BUNDY

For what purpose

MELANIE

To
(she hesitates)
To kill them

There is a long silence

MRS BUNDY
Why

Another silence

MELANIE
I dont know why

MRS BUNDY
I thought not Birds have been on
this planet since archaeopteryx
Miss Daniels a hundred and twenty
million years ago

A TRAVELING SALESMAN ENTERS goes to bar listens

MRS BUNDY
Doesnt it seem odd that theyd wait
all that time to start a a war

against humanity

MELANIE
No one called it a war

SALESMAN
Scotch light on the water

MRS BUNDY
You and Mr Sholes seem to be implying
as much

HELEN
Are you finished here Sebastian

SHOLES
Let me have some apple pie Helen
(to Mrs Bundy)
Who said anything about war All I
said was that some gulls

HELEN
(yelling to kitchen)
One apple pie You want more coffee

SHOLES
No came down on one of my boats
They could have been after the fish
just as you said

SALESMAN
Your captain should have shot at
them

SHOLES
What

SALESMAN
Gulls are scavengers anyway Most
birds are If you ask me we should
wipe them all out World would be
better off without them

MRS BUNDY
(outraged)
Birds
SALESMAN

Yeah birds All they do is make a
mess of everything Who needs them

MRS BUNDY
We need them

SALESMAN
Not if theyre starting a war

MRS BUNDY
They are incapable of organized
warfare
MELANIE
Have you ever seen a jay protecting
a nest

MRS BUNDY
I have seen jays doing everything it
is conceivable for jays to do
Ornithology happens to be my
avocation Miss Daniels Youre
talking about preservation of the
species a hen protecting her young
Theres a vast difference between

MELANIE
Maybe theyre all protecting the
species Maybe theyre tired of being
shot at and roasted in ovens and

MRS BUNDY
Are you discussing gamebirds now
All birds are not gamebirds you
know

MELANIE
I dont know anything about birds
except that theyre attacking this
town

SALESMAN
Then fight back Get yourselves guns
and wipe them off the face of the
earth

MRS BUNDY
That would hardly be possible

DEKE
Why not Mrs Bundy

MRS BUNDY
Because there are 8650 species of
birds in the world today Mr Carter
Its estimated that five billion
seven hundred and fifty million birds
live in the United States alone The
five continents of the world

SALESMAN
(muttering)
Kill them all Get rid of them
Messy animals
MRS BUNDY
probably contain more than a
hundred billion birds

DRUNK
Its the end of the world

DEKE
Well we seem to have more than our
share of them right now Mrs Bundy
Maybe this young ladys right Maybe
theyve all gone crazy

HELEN

SHOLES

(he begins eating)

HELEN
Where are the Bloody Marys Deke

DEKE
Coming
HELEN
(angrily)
Are we running a business here -- or

a bird sanctuary

SHOLES
(beginning to change
his mind)
Actually those gulls must have been
after the fish

MRS BUNDY
Of course

SHOLES
Makes a lot more sense than well
an attack

MRS BUNDY
Of course it does If we believe
that birds are attacking why why

next well believe that grasshoppers
and cockroaches are capable of

DRUNK
Cockroaches Urghh
CLOSE SHOT - WOMAN
getting more and more anxious

WOMAN
Hurry children Finish your lunch

BOY

SHOLES
Maybe were all getting a little

MELANIE
This isnt a few birds I keep telling
you that These are gulls and swifts
and crows and

MRS BUNDY
And what Vultures Hawks Eagles

MELANIE
Maybe Is it impossible

MRS BUNDY
Yes I have never known birds of
different species to flock together
The very concept is unimaginable
(laughing)

Why if that happened we wouldnt
have a chance How could we possible
hope to fight them

SHOLES
We couldnt Youre right Mrs
Bundy

SALESMAN

They made some mess too smashing

below her At this particular moment a car has pulled up
has come to a stop and a man emerges He is in the act of
lighting his dead cigar but his attention is drawn to the
happenings around the gas station With this half-drawn
attention he strikes the match and holds it to the cigar

town rushing around the car park and the streets across the
highway endeavoring to put out the two fires We see
automobiles coming to a stop on Highway One and the oil
smoke beginning to rise from the burning gas station and the
parked cars Some men have managed to start a fire hose and
have trained it on the burning cars Suddenly but slowly the
foreground in the sky just below the CAMERA begins to fill
with wheeling gulls The whole picture below becomes
obliterated by the foreground birds who now begin to swoop
down on the town

recoils from this water attack Through the streaming window
she sees the fire volunteers rushing away for cover To the
left we see a horse with its head covered with gulls its
palomino-colored body covered with crows It is bucking and
leaping and kicking its van to pieces

At this moment the scene is obliterated by the appearance of
a man groping his way closely past the phone booth windows
His face is poring with blood his head and shoulders are
covered with attacking birds He disappears from sight
Melanie now almost in a faint opens her eyes to see Tides
Town Through the booth window she sees Mitch and Deke Carter
the owner of the Tides coming down toward the CAMERA and
waving the birds away from them with flailing arms

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
opens the booth doors and starts out with a cry of

recognition but she has barely stepped out when more gulls
crash around the booth causing her to go back

building adjacent to the flaming and smoking gas station

smoking building

looking across in horror

For a moment there is no sign of anyone about then suddenly

INT THE TIDES

There must be at least twenty people all looking toward the
windows It is as though they are hiding from a storm The
CAMERA is high enough to see Melanie and Mitch COME IN very
hurriedly close the door We see the gulls wheeling outside
There is a kind of stunned silence among the people We can
hear the sound of the screaming gulls outside Suddenly a
womans voice SCREAMS out

WOMAN
Why are they doing it Why are they
doing it

Some of the heads of the group turn
CLOSE SHOT

It is the woman who had the two children screaming at Mrs
Bundy who is seated in a booth table staring numb and
helpless Mrs Bundy turns and looks at her and mutters some
words

MRS BUNDY
((Mrs Bundy offers a
weak explanation of
why the birds could
have gone berserk
like this This
information should
be obtained from Dr
Stager)

Melanie follows his look At this moment there is a loud
CRASH OF GLASS They turn their heads suddenly

MED SHOT - FROM MITCHS AND MELANIES VIEWPOINT

And past the heads of the other people who have also turned
we see one of the back windows of the Tides Restaurant has
gone and gulls are coming in Two or three of the men who
are on the edge of the crowd turn and go back toward the
window beating them out They succeed in doing this

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

They turn from the gulls in the restaurant to look to the

and covers her as if he is tucking a blanket around her to
keep her warm He turns away then

is looking out over the bay when he comes to her This is
not the Melanie we saw at the beginning of the picture Her
hair is disarrayed and her face and clothing are streaked
with soot But beyond a surface physical appearance there
is a weary wisdom in her eyes and a strength to her as she
stands looking toward the distant smoldering town

MELANIE
The town looks clear

MITCH
The bay doesnt

MELANIE
How long have they been gathering

MITCH

The past fifteen minutes

Lydia is hovering near the radio Cathy is sitting ona

the radio as Mitch and Melanie join them

LYDIA
I cant get any of the local stations
I think this is San Francisco

ANNOUNCER
would include formulation of a
central financing committee to handle
credit and to allocate responsibility
for the various facets of the project
A vote on the motion is expected
early tomorrow morning

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
listening

ANNOUNCER

Continuing with the local news police
are still investigating the series
of valuable jade burglaries in the
Chinatown area The round-up of known
criminals has not as yet produced a
suspect but Commissioner Nelson
said today he was certain the
burglaries were quote linked and the
work of the team of professionals
unquote

(pause)
In Bodega Bay early this morning a
large flock of crows attacked a group
of children who were leaving the
school during a fire drill One little
girl was seriously injured and taken
to the hospital in Santa Rosa but
the majority of children reached
safety in the town

(pause)
On the national scene today the
opening of the new session of Congress
was marked by a State of the Union
address that

MITCH
Is that all

ANNOUNCER (0S)
drew a standing ovation for the
President The Chief Executive in
discussing our relation to Europe
and the rest of the world community
said These various elements of our
foreign policy lead as I have said
to a single goal --

MITCH
(sighing)
Were going to need more wood for
the fire We cant let it go out

ANNOUNCER

(continuing as drone

in background)
The goal of a peaceful world of free
and independent states This is our
guide for the present and our vision
for the future -- a free community
of nations independent but
interdependent uniting north and
south east and west in one great
family of man outgrowing and
transcending the hates and fears
that rend our age We will not reach
that goal today or tomorrow We may
not reach it in our lifetime But
the quest is the great adventure of
our century We sometimes chafe at
the burdens of our obligations the
complexity of our decisions the
agony of our choices but there is
no comfort or security for us in
evasion no solution in abdication
no relief in irresponsibility

(pause)
In assuming the tasks of the
Presidency I said that few
generations in all history had
been granted the role of being the
great defender of freedom in its
hour of maximum danger This is our
good fortune and I welcome it now
as I did when I first took office
(pause)
For it is the fate of this generation --
Of you in the Congress and of me as
President -- to live with a struggle
we did not start in a world we did -
not make But the pressures of life
are not always distributed by choice
And while no nation has ever faced
such a challenge no nation has ever
been ready to seize the burden and
the glory of

LYDIA
What happens when we run out of wood

Music begins to play The music is sweet with violins and
long piano arpeggios almost too much to bear against the
tension being played in front of it

MITCH

and the outside of the house begins building almost like
muffled drumbeats THUD THUD with an irregularity of rhythm
Interspersed like the counterpoint in an alien orchestration
is the FLUTTER of wings And then like another section
entering we begin to hear the SCRATCHING and CLAWING at the
roof

She shakes her head

MITCH

a small childs confused but defiant Holding her close
Mitch laughs and she laughs with him Exhausted they stand

night sort of way And suddenly The lights go out

lying on the sidewalk clutching a television set in his
arms

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

strained looking at the road ahead
LONG SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD

a clear sky a bird-free stretch
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

MITCH
(almost as a prayer)
Here we go
(he rams down on the
accelerator)

FULL SHOT - THE CAR - EXTERIOR
as Mitch rams the accelerator to the floor and it zooms ahead
in a burst of speed

FULL SHOT - THOUSANDS OF BIRDS
taking wing

MED SHOT - MORE BIRDS

taking wing

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
screaming

MELANIE
Mitch

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
wrenching at the wheel as the car turns a bend
FULL SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD

through the windshield as a flock of birds take wing
immediately ahead

CLOSE SHOT - THE WINDSHIELD
from the inside as birds flutter against it
CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF OF THE CAR

from the inside as a beak slashes it letting in a thin
line of light

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
wrenching at the wheel again another bend
HELICOPTER SHOT - THE CAR

navigating the sharp bends in the road as birds streak at it
in straight lines

TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE

in the back seat as several slashes appear in the roof over
their heads letting in more light

CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF
More slashes more light in scattered beams
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

her fear growing as the scattered light beams bring back the
memory of the attic room and her flashlight battle with the
owl

CLOSE SHOT - THE ROOF

more slashes building the beak thrusts combining with the
incoming beams of light in a weirdly horrifying way

CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

LYDIA
(almost a prayer)
Dear God dear God please
please what have we done Please
(and then in anger at
the roof and the
birds)
Cant they leave us alone
(shrieking it)
LEAVE US ALONE

MED SHOT - THE CAR INTERIOR all the passengers as the roof
suddenly rips back

FULL SHOT - BIRDS

from inside the car hovering over it the moment the roof
tears back

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

This is too much for her She screams at sight of the birds
and then turns her face into Lydias shoulder

TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE

as Lydia recognizes Melanies need She puts her arm around
Melanies shoulder and gently soothingly holds her close

FULL SHOT - THE CAR
racing along as the birds hover over it
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH

his face screwed in anguish tears rolling down his cheeks
as he grips the wheel and hits the gas pedal
FULL SHOT - THE OPEN CAR

streaming canvas ribbons behind it It turns another bend in
the road

FULL SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - (THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD)

It is arrow-straight no curves

FULL SHOT - THE CAR

in a burst of speed as it hits the straightaway It begins
to outdistance the birds The gap widens A flock of birds
attacks it from the side of the road but it speeds into
them and through them The gap grows wider and wider They
are well ahead of the birds now

CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA

LYDIA
Were losing them

CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
only a nod his face streaming tears
LONG SHOT - THE CAR (BIRDS POV)

as they fall way behind now the car moving swiftly into the
distance

TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MELANIE

on the back seat Melanie begins sobbing in a sudden release
of tension Lydia in compassion and tenderly cradles
Melanies head on her shoulder Melanie her eyes glistening
looks ahead through the windshield

FULL SHOT - THE CAR INTERIOR

all their faces visible

CATHY
Mitch Do do you think theyll
be all right In the trunk Can they
breath
MITCH
(with the faintest
smile)

I think theyll be all right honey
There is hope on their faces as the car streaks into the

wind Not a wild exuberance but a relaxation of tension

They stare ahead through the windshield and then they squint
their eyes against the sudden sunrise ahead and Mitch reaches
up to turn down the sun visor

MITCH
It looks it looks clear up ahead

FULL SHOT - THE CAR
moving AWAY FROM THE CAMERA FAST into magnificent sunrise
over the crest of the hills Further and further into the

distance it goes

FADE OUT

THE END
