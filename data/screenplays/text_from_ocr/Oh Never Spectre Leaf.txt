Wake up dingleberry

TICK TOCK TICK TOCK

RASPY VOICE (VO)
Hey Gigantic bag of doorknobs
WAKE UP

FADE IN
INT TUCKER HOUSE — BEDROOM - MORNING
Blue eyes snap open wide

A body tumbles from the top level of a bunk bed and hits
the carpeted floor with a THUNK

A grandfather CLOCK CHIMES in the far corner of a room
obviously inhabited by a teenage boy

A GROAN sounds from the floor

HOLDEN TUCKER all disheveled brown hair and skinny
arms and legs sits up and gingerly rubs his head

His eyes dart around the room falling on a large glass
aquarium containing a large branch and a sleeping iguana
WYCLEF

HOLDEN
And a good morning to you Wyclef
Did you just call me a bag of
doorknobs

Wyclef snoozes on with nary a response Holden clamors to
his feet and grabs a pair of glasses sitting on a dresser

HOLDEN
Yeah that’s what I thought You
just keep on sleeping and I’1l1
keep on pretending I’m hearing
things
Holden snags a shirt from a pile of discarded clothes and
puts it on followed by his glasses

CAROL (0OS)
Holden Let’s go breakfast is
ready

HOLDEN

Be right there mom
INT TUCKER HOUSE — KITCHEN — DAY

Holden sits at a table backpack beside him shoveling eggs
into his mouth

Across the room at the sink Holden’s mom CAROL (early
40s) rinses dishes and puts them in the dishwasher

CAROL
Did you finish your homework

HOLDEN
But of course madame

CAROL
Even your Calculus

HOLDEN
Well no I just figured I’d throw
a five-spot at Hoyt Tidwell in
homeroom and let him crank it out
He’s quite the brain

Carol shoots him a scowl

HOLDEN
Kidding mom kidding

CAROL
Not funny mister At least not
until I’ve had coffee

Holden BURPS

CAROL
Holden I mean it
HOLDEN
What Better the attic than the
basement right

CAROL
Just finish your breakfast So
help me if you miss the bus one
more ti—

RING-RING RING-RING The phone on the wall goes off Carol
dries her hands and scoops it up

CAROL
Hello
(beat hushed)
It’s not Friday why the hell are
you calling here

Carol’s face goes white and she leaves the room
Holden doesn’t really pay attention as he finishes up his
breakfast He takes the empty plate to the sink rinses it
off and crams it in the dishwasher
He picks up his backpack and slides it on
HOLDEN
Alright mom I’m outta here like

Britney Spears I’1ll catch you

He trails off as he turns and sees his mom holding the
phone limply in her hand

HOLDEN
Mom

CAROL
Your grandma Helen died

INT AIRPORT — JETWAY — DAY

Holden walks down the corridor pulling a small suitcase
behind him head hung low

He pauses at the end of the hall by the airplane entrance
behind boarding PASSENGERS
He SIGHS
INT FLIGHT 815 — DAY

Holden trudges down the aisle checks his ticket and stops
at the appropriate row He stuffs his suitcase into the
overhead compartment and has a seat beside an elderly
gentleman MORTIMER GALE (70s) who snottily INHALES and
GULPS down a loogie

Holden grimaces and fastens his seatbelt

MORTIMER
First time flying sonny

HOLDEN
Huh Oh No No it’s not

MORTIMER
How about by yourself Is it your
first time for that

HOLDEN
Sorta My pet iguana is in the
cargo thingee if that counts

MORTIMER
It doesn’t Where’s your mommy

HOLDEN
She’s not flying out until
tomorrow My grandma on my dad’s
side she died This morning

MORTIMER
I wish I’d died this morning I
rolled down here in a goddamn
wheel chair The big-tittied
stewardess and the copilot had to
carry me on I got a woody the
size of a Louisville Slugger too
and I don’t even have my Viagra
and then I

The old man rambles on as Holden pulls out an MP3 player
jams the earphones into his ear and flips on a song
More passengers file onto the plane

Holden closes his eyes

EXT AIRPORT — RUNWAY — DAY

Flight 815 RUMBLES down the tarmac and takes to the air
INT FLIGHT 815 — DAY

A STEWARDESS blonde and pretty pushes a beverage
cart down the aisle and stops beside a snoozing Holden and
a lip-licking Mortimer

STEWARDESS
Can I get you something to drink
today sir

MORTIMER
Do you have breast milk

STEWARDESS
I beg your pardon sir

MORTIMER
You have the best milk I’1l1 have
one of those Skim would be
peachy

The stewardess lightly taps Holden on the shoulder He
opens his eyes

STEWARDESS
Sorry to wake you sir but would
you like something to drink

HOLDEN
Sure yeah I’1ll take a double
scotch on the rocks with a twist

STEWARDESS
May I see your ID then please
sir

HOLDEN

Better make that a Coke
The stewardess divvies out the beverages and moves along

Holden surveys his surroundings Across the aisle a MAN
wearing pink bunny ears makes faces to the seemingly empty
seat beside him

MAN
A-bwah-bwah-bwah-hooky-dooky-doo

In front of him a shrewish-looking WOMAN spins around to
the man

WOMAN
Do you mind not kicking my seat
idiot

MAN

The Harvey Rabbit is sorry miss
The lady rolls her eyes and turns back around with a huff

RASPY VOICE (0S)
What the hell lady Because I’m
short I can’t get a tall glass
Quit treating me like a Smurf

Holden jumps at the outburst his knees whacking his seat-
tray and spilling his soda all over his lap

HOLDEN
Shit crap shit

MORTIMER
Watch your goddamn language
sonny I’m a Mormon

Holden tries to mop up the mess with a shirtsleeve to no
avail He unfastens his seatbelt

As he steps into the aisle a jolt of TURBULENCE gives the
plane a good shake causing a few surprised YELPS
throughout the cabin

The ‘FASTEN SEATBELT’ notice DINGS on

Holden reaches and enters the bathroom at the rear of the
plane
INT FLIGHT 815 — BATHROOM — DAY

Holden closes the door behind him pulls off a wad of
toilet paper and dabs at the puddle of soda on his pants

He flips the water on and another rough burst of
TURBULENCE flings him to one side of the cramped space

HOLDEN
Son of an asshole

A KNOCK sounds at the door

STEWARDESS (0S)
Excuse me sir I’1ll have to ask
you to return to your seat The
Captain has turned the ‘fasten
seatbelt’ sign on

HOLDEN
Yeah okay right after my package
is done drying I’1l be-rrhhkk

Another BUMP this one enough to CRACK his HEAD against the
mirror and plop him down on the toilet

STEWARDESS (0S)

I beg your pardon sir I must

insist that you—
WUMPWUMPWUMP This time the turbulence doesn’t let up
And it’s followed by a bellowing WHINE of TEARING METAL
Then a ROAR of WIND explodes causing Holden to press his
hands to his ears as his eyes threaten to bug out of his
face
He struggles to the door fingers grasping the latch
He pulls it open

INT FLIGHT 815 — FUSELAGE — SAME

Seats and passengers hurtle like confetti into dark gray
clouds amidst swirling rain and various plane parts
SCREAMS and THUNDER fill the air

An errant burst of wind slams the DOOR against Holden’s
skull with a THUNK He falls back into the

BATHROOM

He trips and for good measure WHACKS his head on the sink
The world goes black before his eyes

LATER

Holden’s eyes snap open darting back and forth

He reaches up and grabs the sink pulling himself to his
feet

All is very very quiet
Holden rubs his eyes and stares at the golf-ball-sized knot
on his forehead in the mirror his fingers gingerly probing

the welt

Then he stops eyes slowly circling the odd lighting of the
bathroom

His eyes drift upward

And stop on the full moon peering through the very large
hole in the bathroom ceiling

HOLDEN
Oh holy Voltron shit

Hands shaking he gathers himself and opens the bathroom
door

EXT PET CEMETERY — NIGHT

The ragged tail section of the plane is all that seems to
remain of Flight 815

Holden’s breath catches in his throat as he peers from the
wreckage and takes in his surroundings
Headstones crypts and underbrush stretch for acres
surrounded by a towering iron fence and stone gargoyles

In the distance thick forests and jagged mountains loom
over the night

Holden steps over the edge of the wreckage and hops to the
ground

He lands on a ragged checkered picnic blanket complete
with a basket and a half dozen mason jars containing some
kind of purple liquid

Brow furrowed he snags up one of the jars and twists off
the lid He takes a WHIFF

Immediately his eyes stream tears and his eyebrows light
on FIRE He drops the glass with a YOWL as he smacks
himself in the face

HOLDEN
Ow ow ow What the hell dude

KUH-KLICK The sound of a shotgun being cocked stops Holden
mid-eyebrow-slap

DINK (0S)
Do you have any idea what you just
did numbnuts

Holden slowly turns to the familiar-sounding raspy voice to
see a four-and-a-half-foot tall dwarf DINK LEDBETTER
(30s) standing before him all muttonchops goatee and
weird hat Oh and a sawed-off shotgun

DINK
Well Do you

HOLDEN
Uhdo I what

Dink points to the wreckage

And the pair of thigh-high black boots attached to legs
sticking out from underneath it
DINK

I was on a date jackass And I

was a half
away from

-jar of fullmoonshine
cramming my funstuff in

her shitbox

Holden looks utterly at a loss

HOLDEN

A date Say what Isn’t
thisisn’t this a graveyard or

something

DINK

So It’s a foolproof lay genius

Hooch and
to broads

dead pets do funky shit
lemme tell you And you

just crashed your ride into my
surefire pussy Are you getting

the bigass

picture now

HOLDEN

I don’twhere the hell am I Am

I dead

DINK

You should be for fucking up a
man’s happy ending You’re lucky I
don’t pump a round of—

AWOOOOO000 A HOWL and a
night

Dink whirls to the sound

close one at that shatters the

shotgun raised and ready

HOLDEN

What was that

Be quiet

Holden

What

DINK
assclown

HOLDEN

DINK

HOLDEN
Holden my name is Holden I’m
from Wichita Kansas and my name
is Holden Tucker

DINK
Well excuse the hell outta me
Hold and Fuck her Now shut up

A low GROWL sounds from behind a crypt and a huge shadow
detaches itself from the night

A monstrous Siamese werewolf shambles into the moonlight
grafted together at the hip and standing upright on four
legs its dual faces a mishmash of fangs black fur and
blunted feral ferocity MERCUTIO and PIPPI HEMINGWAY

Dink SIGHS and props the shotgun on his shoulder

DINK
Mercutio Pippi Looking into
afterlife accommodations are we

MERCUTIO
Shut thine whiskeyhole wee
scalawag Thou art not our concern
this eve

DINK
Yeah You think you can take a
dump near my picnic and get away
with it

Mercutio clears his throat and looks at the ground
MERCUTIO
Ahem I have engaged in no such
foul action I must say
Dink takes a big SNIFF and grins
DINK

I wasn’t talking to you fuzzy
nuts It smells like chick shit

PIPPI
Oh cram it up your tailpipe you
fidget We’ll shit on your picnic
any damn time we please Now move

DINK
And why would I wanna do that

PIPPI
The Nocturnal Wench Everlasting
wants the boy And then we will be
on our merry way and you can go
back to punching your clown or
whatever it is you do out here

Dink thinks about it

DINK
Nope can’t do it Not ‘til I get
through with him first See the
kid mucked up any shot I had at
bumping gruesomes tonightthat
is unless I wanna dabble in
necrophiliahmmm

The twins bristle fur standing on end

MERCUTIO
Anger us not dwarf lest ye desire
reaping the dire consequences

In an instant Dink whips another sawed-off shotgun from a
holster strapped to his back He CLICKS the hammers back on
the dual firearms

DINK
I’m afraid that’s gonna be a two-
way street Fido and Fluffy

Holden cowering behind a grave pokes his head out
HOLDEN

Umany chance I get a say in any
of this
DINK
Shut up Holden Fucker I already
hate your guts Don’t make me
paint a headstone with ‘em too

Distant HOWLS fill the night Mercutio and Pippi grin a
leer of daggered fangs

EXT THE DEVIL’S HAIRPEICE — NIGHT

The scampering paws and claws of dozens of charging
WEREWOLVES kick up dust dead grass and rubble on a stretch
of crimson prairie

Behind the incessant HOWLING the ROAR of an engine sounds

A stark white Ford Bronco tears across the ground driven
by DEATH a tall skeletal figure wrapped in a black cowl

The Bronco pulls a black RV shaped like a miniature castle
INT HELLENA’S RV (MOVING) — NIGHT

A single throne sits in front of a wall of jagged crystal
orbs each showing a different area of the surrounding land
like some sort of magical video surveillance system

HELLENA the Nocturnal Wench Everlasting a collection of
emerald robes and exotically nasty and ageless features
sits in the throne filing her nails with a shard of bone

The RV bucks and shakes over the ground causing Hellena to
mess up a nail She taps an eyeball button on the arm of
the chair

HELLENA
Death do you mind I know we are
trying to keep pace with the
Hemingway twins but if I keep
breaking nails how am I going to
claw anybody’s eyes out For the
love of newt eye keep it steady

DEATH
(over intercom)
Yes dark lady as you desire
(beat MORE)

DEATH (CONT’D)
Stupid old dingbat I should give
her a River Styx enema and see how
she likes it when the waters of
Hades scald the hemorrhoids from
her big fat—

HELLENA
Death

DEATH
Huh Yes dark lady

HELLENA
I can still hear you

Beat

DEATH
Sorry sorry dark lady I
accidentally left my
antidepressants in my coffin
Mucho apologies won’t happen
again et cetera

Hellena jabs at the eye and it blinks shut cutting off the
intercom

HELLENA
I swear if he weren’t already
dead I’d slit his pasty throat
She gets back to filing her nails

EXT PET CEMETERY — NIGHT

The HOWLS grow closer Dink slowly backs up as the Siamese
werewolves GROWL and step closer

KABLAM KABLAM Dink fires both shotguns bullets searing
the night Mercutio and Pippi dive aside as two HEADSTONES
EXPLODE into shrapnel

Dink runs pushing Holden along as he does

DINK
C’mon numbnuts Time to bid this
place a fond farewell

Holden dashes through the maze of crypts and headstones
the SNARLING of werewolves close at his heels

BLAM BLAM Dink spins and fires shots into the air
bullets whizzing mere inches by the Hemingway twins

Holden SQUEAKS at the noise heart pounding in his ears

HOLDEN
Holy shitballs I think I just
pissed my pants You mind telling
me where we’re going for the love
of poontang

Dink responds by raising a shotgun and firing into the
ground several yards in front of them CHINK A manhole
cover careens from the ground leaving a round opening
before them

Dink shoves Holden into the hole immediately leaping in
behind him just as Mercutio and Pippi’s SNAPPING JAWS graze
the space above them

INT MORLOCK SEWER — NIGHT

SPLASH SPLASH Holden and Dink plummet into two feet of
putrid slimy water SNARLS and GROWLS sound from above

Dink slogs hurriedly down the corridor

DINK
Ugh it smells like eight miles of
unwiped ass in here

Holden steadies himself against the wall

HOLDEN
Hey Where are you going

DINK
Use your noggin thundertard
There’s about 900 more stampeding
(MORE )

DINK (CONT’D)
werewolves behind the Hemingway
twins And I’m betting they can
fit through the manhole You wanna
stay there and swap spit with ‘em

Holden considers this and quickly follows Dink’s lead as he
takes a right down another pipeline

SECONDARY PIPELINE

The water ends and the duo steps onto a stretching length
of cracked stone and iron Small flickering torches light
the corridor

Holden quite wet and short of breath taps Dink on the
shoulder Dink whirls around shoving the barrel of one of
his shotguns under Holden’s chin Gulp

HOLDEN
Ah heh sorry there little guy I
just—

DINK

Little guy Little Listen
dipshit even though I ain’t the
tallest drink of water in Spectre
Leaf I’m hung like a jury you
dig

HOLDEN
Riiiight Again sorry I wasn’t
thinking But look you mind
telling me what a Spectre Leaf is

Dink lowers the shotgun

DINK
You really ain’t from around here
huh Spectre Leaf is where I live
and where you’re stuck And it’s
called that because you can visit
but don’t ever ‘spect to leave

Dink GUFFAWS like an idiot
Dink’s fist to

dropping him to his knees

Dink scans the

HOLDEN
Yeah Right Ha Ha Ha Look
what do you mean I’m stuck here I
don’t even know where the hell
‘here’ is and I don’t want—

DINK
(finger to lips)
SHHHH
HOLDEN
Huh You freaking ‘shhhh’ I want
to know what hapOOOMPH

Holden’s solar plexus shuts him right up

darkness SNIFFING the air He stops weapon

trained on a section of the ceiling

DINK
Hey assbag You best come down
before I start playing shotgun
pifiata

Right on cue SHYLOCK THE MORLOCK a slimy skinny lizard-
like creature with droopy ears a long tail and a drooling

problem drops

Holden regains

from the ceiling

SHYLOCK
Sssorry my vertically-challenged
compatriot Me thoughts you were
sssomebody else Me heards the
sssandals approaching ssso me
hides

his feet clutching his stomach

HOLDEN
Owww what the hell did you hit me
for And what the shit is that
thing

Dink ignores him

DINK
What sandals Morlock And if
youre fucking with me be warned
I’ve got two guns and two very
blue balls

SHYLOCK
No no sssmall one He-who-
mussst-not-—be-mentioned me hears
him Me ssswears it

DINK
Bullshit You heard us You heard
me and the retarded kid here

A small CHITTER sounds in the darkness

HOLDEN
What was that

MORLOCK
Nothings that was nothings at
all Me bowels is acting up me
eats too many sssalamanders at
sssupper

Dink gestures to a torch on the wall and nods to Holden

Dink cocks his

DINK
Grab that and hold it up

HOLDEN
I’m dreaming That’s the only
logical explanation And I’m not
doing shit until I wake up because
this dream sucks balls

shotgun

DINK
It’s gonna be a living nightmare
if you don’t get to skippin’
capice

Holden immediately snags the torch from its post
HOLDEN
Sounds fantastic

The CHITTER sounds again

DINK
Hold it higher

Holden obliges sticking the torch higher up in the air
coating the ceiling in light

Without warning a rather large iguana leaps from the
shadows and lands on Holden who SCREAMS like a teakettle
and drops the torch to the ground with a CLATTER

HOLDEN
Get it off me get it off me get
it
(then realizing)
Wyclef Is that you What the
hell

The iguana responds by unfurling a set of leathery wings
and belching out a small burst of fire

That catches what remains of Holden’s eyebrows on fire
again

Holden scrambles to his feet YELPING in pain as he beats
his face with his hands

WHUNK Shylock tackles him with a HISS and leans over him
cascading drool from his maw extinguishing the fire

SHYLOCK
Ssstupid boy sssteals me dinner
Me will eats ssstupid boy
inssstead
FLIP FLOP FLIP FLOP
Everybody freezes

FLIP FLOP

SHYLOCK
Oh fucks me

In a flash the creature disappears down the hallway in a

skitter of clawed limbs
FLIP FLOP Dink jerks Holden to his feet
FLIP FLOP The sound grows steadily closer

HOLDEN
What’s that noise

DINK
I don’t think you wanna stick
around to find out Let’s go

Dink takes off down the corridor Wyclef spreads his wings

and takes flight after him
FLIP FLOP
BUDDY NINJA (0S)
The masses are meat Meat is
murder Murder is mayhem And
mayhem ishappiness

Holden seems to find the desire to haul ass

INT MORLOCK SEWER - SIDE PIPELINE — NIGHT

Shylock scampers down a narrow corridor tongue hanging

out spittle flying
FLIP FLOP The sound is close
The creature picks up its scramble
FLIP FLOP Very close
SHYLOCK
Me doesn’t dessserves this no me
doesn’t Me just wanted sssupper

and the ssstupid boy came an-
hhhrrrkkk

Shylock tumbles to a stop in a tangle of claws and tail He

collects itself from the floor and stops cold

Directly in front of it sits a pair of worn thong sandals

Flip-flops to be exact
The Morlock’s eyes swell to saucers

THWACK And dilate to black orbs behind a splatter of blood
as his head rolls down the corridor

BUDDY NINJA (0S)
Ah happiness indeed

A bloody silver-plated samurai sword zips into a sheath

A pair of feet with black nail polish belonging to BUDDY
NINJA slides into the sandals and disappears into the
shadows

FLIP FLOP
EXT HIGHWAY TO HELL — MANHOLE — NIGHT

KABLAM A SHOTGUN BLAST rips a metal cover from its
moorings

Dink steps from the hole followed by Holden and Wyclef
onto a wide road constructed from a mishmash of red and
black cobblestones Palm trees with blazing fire for leaves
light the night

Dink holsters his shotguns on his back and walks off down
the highway

HOLDEN
Yo dude wait up

Dink stops and glowers

DINK
You know you’ve already been more
trouble than a case of the clap
I’m tired I’m pissed and I need
to go home and rub one out So
please oh please tell me what I
can do for you now

Wyclef CHITTERS and perches on Holden’s shoulder

HOLDEN
I uh II just wanted to say
thank you I don’t even know your
name and you’ve saved me like a
time or ten already Plus I’m
having a really really crummy
day So you know thanks and all

Dink fishes through his pockets and pulls out a cigar He
strides over and grabs Wyclef’s tail snatching him from
his roost

HOLDEN
Hey

Dink gives Wyclef a squeeze causing fire to belch from his
mouth and lights the cigar He lets Wyclef go who in turn
snaps at him before hopping back on Holden’s shoulder

DINK
The name’s Dink And you’re a
gigantic pain in my scrotum

HOLDEN
I’m Holden Holden Tu—

DINK
Yeah yeah Hold and Fuck her and

HOLDEN

What were we running from down
there

Dink snorts and continues walking down the road
DINK
Same thing I’m walking away from

Holden trots after him
Dink whirls on

HOLDEN
Hang on a sec Where are you
going What am I supposed to do

DINK
I dunno go find a spoon and eat a
bigass bowl of ‘Not My Damn
Problem’

HOLDEN
But I need to wake up

Holden

DINK

Listen shortbus you wanna keep

Land knock yourself out But for
the love of sweet trim quit
bitching to me about it

(sighs)
Look I’1l take you as far as the
Orphanage on one condition no
more asstard questions

HOLDEN
Word you got it no sweat
(beat)
What’s the Orphanage

EXT THE ORPHANAGE — NIGHT

A dilapidated three-story house constructed of worn wood
and stone stands atop a lone hill several hundred yards
away from the Highway its windows filled with dim light

Dink trudges up the hill Holden follows Wyclef on his
shoulder with a large piece of black tape slapped across

his mouth

They step onto a large rickety PORCH that GROANS all to
lifelike as they walk across it to a huge wooden door

Dink pushes it

open

DINK
Ah it’s good to be home

INT THE ORPHANAGE — FOYER — NIGHT

Dink walks down the dimly lit hallway between rows of
candles with Holden and Wyclef in tow

HOLDEN
(through tape)
Hmmppphhrmmmphrrrk

DINK
That sounded like another
question I’m seriously
considering yanking your tongue
out and shoving it up your—

ELEMENO PEE (0S)
Dink Ledbetter you mind your
manners

ELEMENO PEE (60s) a plump woman clad in a bright blue
muumuu and equally blue cape stands at the far end of the
hall holding a kerosene lamp and a cane

DINK
What I was going to say
‘turdcutter’

Elemeno strides past him to Holden examining his face She
yanks the tape from his mouth

HOLDEN
OW Shit lady

WHACK She smacks Holden in the face

HOLDEN
OW What the hell

ELEMENO PEE
You mind your tongue young man
There is no cursing in my home

Holden points at Dink a look of disbelief on his face
HOLDEN

Then how does he even complete a
sentence
DINK
Sign language What’s for
breakfast

ELEMENO PEE
Don’t be rude Dink If you’re
going to bring over new
houseguests pray tell introduce
them

DINK
Sure thing but I gotta take a
wicked deuce first Stay clear of
the crapper

He waddles away GRUNTING with each step

Holden points to Wyclef as he extends his hand

HOLDEN
This is my iguana Wyclef Who I’m
thinking of calling Maxi now that
he has wings And I’m Holden
Tucker From Wichita

Elemeno ignores the hand and hugs him

Holden wiggles

ELEMENO PEE
Oh my that’s in Kansas My name
is Elemeno Pee and that is just
splendid news

out of her grasp

HOLDEN
Waitasec you know about Kansas
So this isn’t real right This
place I mean I’m going to wake
up in a loony bin strapped to a
gurney with my skull hacked open
or something aren’t I

ELEMENO PEE
I am afraid Spectre Leaf is as
real as Ragnarok and you are stuck
right smack in the middle of it

HOLDEN
Shit

Elemeno shakes a finger at him her eyes flashing a sudden
bright crimson

ELEMENO PEE
I will wash your mouth out with
kerosene and a flamethrower if any
more sewage seeps out of it do
you understand

HOLDEN
(gulps)
Y-yes ma’am

ELEMENO PEE
I’m very pleased to see you didn’t
suffer any brain damage from your
plane crash then Now I imagine
you must be quite hungry Come
with me

Elemeno shuffles off down the hall

Holden’s brow scrunches and his eyes narrow Did she just
say ‘plane crash’

INT THE ORPHANAGE — KITCHEN — NIGHT

Steam rises from a variety of bowls and serving dishes on a
long wooden table flanked by a dozen stools on either side

Elemeno ambles into the room cane working to support her
followed by Holden and Wyclef

Dink sits at the head of the table a bare plate in front
of him twiddling his thumbs

HOLDEN
I thought you had toyou know
take a number two

DINK
The hammer has already been
dropped in record-setting time It
(MORE )

DINK (CONTD)
blew out of me like a coffee
monsoon

ELEMENO PEE
Don’t be a Nasty Nelson Dink

DINK
What He asked I told Now can I
get some rubba-dub-grub or what

ELEMENO PEE
Indeed we all may Have a seat
Holden Anywhere is fine

Holden sits in a stool a respectable distance away from
Dink as Elemeno busies herself preparing plates She sets
one in front of Dink one in front of Holden and one on
the floor for Wyclef Everybody digs in

ELEMENO PEE
So Holden do you have a
sweetheart

HOLDEN
(mouth full)
Huh No Not hardly

DINK
Neither do I thanks to you

ELEMENO PEE
(ignoring Dink)
Well why not You are quite the
handsome young gentleman

DINK
Are you serious The kid looks
like he did a hundred-dash in a
ninety-yard gym

HOLDEN
Thanks I also got turned down for
prom by three different girls last
week I didn’t even ask two of
them
Dink reaches for a second helping of mashed potatoes

Elemeno whacks

ELEMENO PEE
I’m certain you’ll find a nice
young lady when the time is right
Holden Good things come to those
who wait

DINK
Ha That philosophy and those
coke-bottles he’s wearing should
get his skin wagon to tuna town by
the turn of the ow

Dink’s hand with a wooden spoon

DINK
Sheesh ma what’d I do I didn’t
even cuss

ELEMENO PEE
Don’t think I don’t understand
your disgusting euphemisms young
man You be polite to our guests

Dink grumbles between forkfuls of his meal

HOLDEN
Hold on you’re his mom

ELEMENO PEE
I’m mother to many here at the
Orphanage twenty-three boys and
girls to be exact They are all
snug in their beds at the moment
but Dink was the first child I
ever took in when he was all of
about two

HOLDEN
Two years old or two feet tall

THWAP A gob of mashed potatoes hits Holden in the side of

the head
ELEMENO PEE
I can’t say you didn’t deserve
that one Dink may be short in
stature but he has enormous heart

Holden wipes potatoes from his face

HOLDEN
And insulting vocabulary

ELEMENO PEE
It’s all part of his spunk Now
let’s all of us finish up We have
a big day in store for tomorrow

HOLDEN
Does it involve getting me back
home

Elemeno rises and smiles

ELEMENO PEE
I believe it does indeed Holden

INT THE ORPHANAGE — LARGE CLOSET — NIGHT

Lantern light fills a small room littered with hanging
clothes and a hammock stretched from wall to wall

Elemeno Holden and Wyclef enter

ELEMENO PEE
Here is where you shall sleep for
the eve

Holden plops down in the hammock and flips right out with
THUNK He staggers to his feet and this time carefully
eases back into it Wyclef curls up on his chest

HOLDEN
Thanks
(then drowsy)
Tell me something Miss Pee How
did you know I was in a plane
crash

ELEMENO PEE
A fortuitous guess One that will
make more sense tomorrow I assure
you Here you may rest and be safe
from all worries and danger

HOLDEN
Danger What danger

Elemeno extinguishes the lantern bathing the room in
darkness

ELEMENO PEE
Hellena the Nocturnal Wench
Everlasting seeks you with fierce
voraciousness I fear she suspects
you are as important to Spectre
Leaf as we do

A light SNORE escapes Holden’s lips

ELEMENO PEE
Good night young Holden Tucker
May your dreams haunt you not

She closes the door
EXT HIGHWAY TO HELL — REST AREA — NIGHT

The white Bronco with Hellena’s RV in tow and stampeding
werewolves veer into a gravel parking lot littered with
covered wagons rusted campers and multiple outhouses

The engine shuts off and Death steps from the vehicle
taking note of several gawking ONLOOKERS that regard him
and the werewolves with various SCREAMS and arm flailing

Death CLAPS his skeletal hands THUNDER ROARS at their
impact and LIGHTNING STREAKS from the sky incinerating
everyone in its path into piles of ash

The drawbridge-like door at the rear of the RV HISSES and
opens in a GRINDING of GEARS and CHAINS

Hellena gathers her robes and steps from the miniature
castle on wheels
HELLENA
Curse you Death It smells like
sulfur and burnt condor feathers
out here Could you not have used
something more refined like
Bubonic Plague or mad cow

DEATH
Sorry dark lady I left my Manual
of Proper Decimation back with my
antidepressants

Hellena pulls out a spyglass and stares off into the night

SPYGLASS

In the distance the Orphanage stands under the light of

the full moon

REST AREA

Hellena returns the spyglass into the folds of her robes

HELLENA
Mercutio Pippi Heel

The Siamese werewolves shamble forward from the lupine

pack

MERCUTIO
You bellowed milady

HELLENA
Indeed I did How far away are
they

Dual NOSES SNIFF the air Pippi pokes a clawed paw down the
Highway to Hell

PIPPI
Eleven-point-two fathoms thataway
surrounded by a meadow of
nightshade that smells like old
sunshine and retch
HELLENA
Damn it to Hades Why do they have
to be in the blasted Orphanage

MERCUTIO
Methinks thou doth protest too
much milady

HELLENA
Oh thou doth doth thou Keep
your tongue behind your fangs
Mercutio When I want your
opinion I’ll throw a bone across
the yard and you can bury it

Hellena paces wringing her hands together causing a faint
green glow to burn forth

HELLENA
The Orphanage is protected by
Selfless Do-Gooder Magic much
like the Humane Society and Dunkin
Donuts

PIPPI
Uhwhat exactly does that mean

HELLENA
Silence As long as they remain
within the Orphanage my black
arts are not able to smite them
like roaches under a boot heel
This is highly irritating

Then her eyes light up and she SNAPS her fingers sending
an errant burst of green fire into a random werewolf who
YELPS and runs around HOWLING

WEREWOLF
Stop drop and roll Stop drop
and roll

HELLENA

Death Fetch my staff And
Mercutio Pippi Have all your
kindred raid the outhouses
MERCUTIO
Disgusting-task-demanded-by-insane
harlet sayeth what

CRACK Another streak of FIRE zings the twins’ butts

HELLENA
Make haste with the waste hounds

The werewolves and Death scatter
INT THE ORPHANAGE — LARGE CLOSET — NIGHT

Holden and Wyclef SNORE from their hammock as the DOOR
CREAKS open

A short shadowed figure steps into the room Hands reach
out

And grasp the edge of the hammock and give it a jerk

Holden hits the floor with a THUNK and he’s awake in an
instant

HOLDEN
Whozzat What the I don’t have
morning wood Ow

Dink stands over him grinning ear to ear

DINK
Wake up you bag of doorknobs
Time to rise and shine much like
my pecker in a porno

Holden struggles to his feet

HOLDEN
Has anyone ever commended you on
what a giant King Kong asshole you
are

ELEMENO PEE (0S)
Mind that language boys

DINKHOLDEN
Yes ma‘am

Ww
Ww
Holden yawns as he gathers up Wyclef and sets him on his
shoulder

HOLDEN
Is the sun even out yet

Dink snorts and shakes his head

DINK
Boy you’re about as smart as a
jar of pubic hair aintcha Dodger
is gonna just love you

HOLDEN
Who the hell is Dodger

Dink exits the room
DINK (0S)

You’re gonna find out when you get

your rear in gear So come on
INT THE ORPHANAGE — KITCHEN — NIGHT
Moonlight and a gentle breeze seep through the curtains of
an open window Elemeno Pee sits in a rocking chair in the
corner of the room knitting

Dink BELCHES as he and Holden shuffle into the room

ELEMENO PEE
Dink must you be so crass

DINK
What Better the attic than the
basement

HOLDEN

Hey That’s one of my lines

DINK
Hmm I must’ve lost the copyright
notice in the mail along with my
subscription to Like-I-Give-A-Crap
Monthly

Holden throws his hands up as Elemeno rises from her seat
HOLDEN
So I don’t mean to be rude but
what’s the deal here When do I go
home I mean I appreciate the
hospitality and all but my
grandma just died my mom’s gotta
be worried sick and I have a hot
date with Katie Supik on Friday

Dink crosses his arms and stares at Holden

HOLDEN
My grandma just died my mom’s
gotta be worried sick and I don’t
want to miss Battlestar Galactaca
on Friday Happy now

Elemeno ambles across the room and gives Holden a hug

ELEMENO PEE
Patience my dear boy patience
The Artful Draft Dodger shall
answer all of your concerns in due
time

HOLDEN
Say what

Elemeno pulls open a huge refrigerator door

ELEMENO PEE
This way Holden It’s due time

Holden scrunches his face and frowns

HOLDEN
In the refrigerator

ELEMENO PEE
There is no refrigerator

Holden walks up to the appliance and stares inside Instead
of food and condiments a single fireman’s pole runs from
the top and disappears into yawning blackness

HOLDEN
UhI don’t know about this
DINK
Oh quit being a pussy

Suddenly Holden lurches into the fridge due to a running
shove from the dwarf

INT KITCHEN - REFRIGERATOR — NIGHT

Holden’s limbs flail about his hands and legs scrambling
for a hold on the pole

He zips down the pole and into the darkness with a ZING
INT THE ORPHANAGE — ART GALLERY — NIGHT

Holden drops into a room filled with various paintings
feet smacking the floor

He removes his glasses wipes them off and replaces them
squinting at the paintings

He pauses on one in particular a six-foot tall canvas
leaning against a wall with a lifelike picture of a man
dressed in a pink bunny suit with floppy ears on it

As he steps closer to the painting the rabbit-man HARVEY
leaps out at him

HARVEY
Boogity boogity boobies

Holden SHRIEKS in surprise trips over his feet mid-
backpedal and goes down in a heap

HOLDEN
Don’t eat me

HARVEY
The Harvey cannot eat you The
Harvey eats carrots because he’s a
bunny And he said ‘boobies’ It’s
a hilarious word

Holden regains his feet brushing himself off
HOLDEN
Why’d you jump out at me like
that I’m pretty sure I pissed my
pants a little Again

HARVEY
I’m The Harvey Hey and you’re
the boy in the picture

HOLDEN
What are you talking about

DODGER (0S)

(English accent)
Welcome to my gallery young
friend

Holden whips around to the speaker a man THE ARTFUL DRAFT
DODGER (40s) clad in a loud Hawaiian shirt knickers and
sandals with bright yellow socks

DODGER
Sorry if Harvey here gave you a
fright he means you no harm

HARVEY
The Harvey is useless as boobies
on a breakfast sandwich Oh-oh he
said ‘boobies’ again Boo Bees

Harvey skips through the labyrinth of paintings singing
gibberish as he does

Dodger grins after him

DODGER

He may be a few sandwiches short
of a picnic but he’s a bloody fine
lad Harvey is

(extends hand)
I’m Dodger also known as The
Artful Draft Dodger if you want to
be excruciatingly formal about
introductions

Holden shakes his hand
Dodger walks
from Holden

HOLDEN
Why do they call you that You
know besides to be excruciatingly
formal

DODGER
Well why do you think

HOLDEN
Umbecause you dodge army drafts
in a fancy way

DODGER
(chuckles)
That’s not a shabby guess Holden
Tucker But no it’s due to my
knack for painting and eluding
buying rounds of pints for me
mates at the pubs

HOLDEN
I really wanna know how the hell
everybody seem to know my name
around this place

over to an easel with a canvas facing away

DODGER
Because Holden

He turns the picture around Holden’s eyes widen

And his face mirrors the exact expression as the painting

of him shows

DODGER
I’ve been expecting you

HOLDEN
What the shit dude Howhow’d
you get that

DODGER
Not get dear boy but paint as in
I painted it It’s a gift
He gestures to another collection of paintings of Dink on
the toilet taking a bath and giving someone the finger

DODGER
And a bit of a curse as you can
see Unfortunately I can’t
control theinspiration to the
best of my liking

He points to another series of paintings arranged side by
side

PAINTINGS

Holden emerging from the plane’s tail section
Dink and Holden running through the sewers
Holden and Wyclef sleeping in the hammock

Hellena Death and the werewolves extinguishing torches

The inside of a tavern save for a lone man behind the bar

A creepy-looking amusement park with a hideous ghoul at its

entrance

A pair of flip-flops and a bloodied samurai sword
Three large golden skeleton keys

HOLDEN
At the risk of repeating myself
for like the 800° time in the past
two days What the hell
Dodger paces the paintings
DODGER

I see the future my dear lad And
then I paint it

HOLDEN
Wellholy ‘Heroes’ ripoff
Batman

DODGER

Every painting in here at some
time or another has come true
This collection you see here I
painted these two days ago And I
believe they and you are quite
important for the future of
Spectre Leaf

HOLDEN
You know I gotta tell you Mr
Dodger the only important thing
to me right now is getting home to
my family I’m supposed to be with
dad and everyone else by the time
the sun comes up

Dodger pulls aside a painting of a pitch-black sky save for
a full moon

DODGER
Do you know what this is

Holden stares at the picture

HOLDEN
Is this a trick question

DODGER
More importantly do you know what
it is not

HOLDEN
Um something making a lick of
sense

Dodger retrieves another painting this one of a blazing
yellow sun and slams it down in front of Holden

DODGER
Spectre Leaf has not seen the
light of day in three-dozen years
(MORE )

DODGER (CONT’D)
thanks to the bloody Nocturnal
Wench Everlasting I painted that
particular piece this morning
shortly after you arrived in
succession with the lot of these
others I believe they all lead to
this the sun returning to warm
our faces to nourish our trees
to heal our souls to—

HOLDEN
Okay okay I get the pic Maya
Angelou Sheesh You think I’m
some sort of piece to the puzzle
got it But riddle me this Will
it get me home again

EXT HIGHWAY TO HELL — NIGHT

Mercutio and Pippi slink underneath the rows of fiery palm

trees followed by their pack of werewolves pulling a large

covered wagon They stop their tongues hanging out as they
pant and slobber

The white Bronco and RV pull up behind them and rumbles to
a halt Death and Hellena exit the vehicle

Hellena strides up to the Hemingway twins clutching a
gnarled green staff

HELLENA
Well What are you two waiting
for the midday sun This attack
requires precision and complete
darkness Get this litter to work

MERCUTIO
Surely you jest milady The
stench is most pungent and foul
andwell ‘tis really most
repugnant

PIPPI
I’m with him It smells like a big
bag of ass

Hellena whirls to Death

HELLENA
Death Please remind them of my
policy regarding disobedience and
insubordination while I meditate
for my spells

She storms off

DEATH
Disobedience results in death At
the hands ofmyself Who is me
and he is I Who is Death
Andlook I’m really no good at
this intimidation thing but let’s
just say if you don’t get to work
there will be a scythe involved
with some sort of spaying and
neutering comprende

MERCUTIO
Sayeth no more harbinger of vile
castration

PIPPI
Yeah everybody get moving and

sling some butt mud

The werewolves grumble and growl and shred the burlap
cover from over the wagon

A huge steaming pile of outhouse remnants from the Rest
Area sits in the bed

The werewolves bury their paws in the putrid mess and heave
gobs of it at the flaming palm trees

EXT THE ORPHANAGE — FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

Dink paces the porch as he puffs on a cigar and swigs
fullmoonshine from a mason jar

He squints out at the Highway to Hell

One by one fiery palm trees wink from view
DINK
Oh great just take a big shit all
up in my hat why dontcha

INT THE ORPHANAGE — GALLERY — NIGHT

The Artful Draft Dodger paces finally stopping in front of
the one with the three golden skeleton keys

DODGER
These keys Holden these keys are
the key

HOLDEN

Say what gutterslut

DODGER
These keys are the essence of
Spectre Leaf I believe they will
be found in concurrence with three
challenges that shall unlock the
door to success for a brave and
noble adventurer’s journey

HOLDEN
Journey Journey to where

Dodger points to the painting of the old man seated ina
monstrous wheelchair

DODGER
To find this elderly chap

HOLDEN
The guy that looks like
Methuselah’s uncle

DODGER
I believe he is Mortimer Gale and
the Caretaker of Pandora’s Hope
Chest an artifact that
disappeared many years ago before
the Wench Everlasting bathed the
world in darkness
HOLDEN
What makes you think that geezer
has it

Dodger reaches into a jacket pocket and pulls out a folded
piece of parchment

DODGER
Because I have a map that states
Mortimer and the Chest are indeed
in the same location

HOLDEN
And you’re just now getting around
to looking for him How long has
it been dark here again

DODGER
Easy there lad Painting the
future isn’t an exact science it
takes a bit of working out and
filling in blanks And that takes
time But I believe that this
chest holds the answer to making
our grass grow once more anda
lift home for you

A THUNK of boots landing on the floor sounds from the room
and Dink steps from behind a row of paintings

DINK
Sorry to bust up the circle jerk
but we’ve got a rather large
donkey punch of a problem

INT THE ORPHANAGE — LIVING ROOM — NIGHT
Elemeno Pee Dodger Dink Holden and Wyclef peer through
the curtains of the front window at a dark stretch of the

Highway to Hell

DODGER
This changes nothing

Elemeno twists

DINK
(chuckles)
Are you kidding me I’d say the
kid better caulk up his cornhole
because Hellena’s out there with a
ten-foot strap-on and is rarin’ to
st-OW OW OW OW Sorry sorry sorry

Dink’s ear with a vise-like grip

ELEMENO PEE
Oh my dear tart-mouthed son
Holden won’t have to worry about
walking into a trap

She releases the lobe which Dink rubs gingerly

Elemeno merely

Dink whirls to

DINK
Why’s that Did you bring Rube
Goldberg back from the dead

smiles

DINK
(realizing)
No Oh no Not a chance There’1l
be ski lifts in hell before that
I ain’t going with him

ELEMENO PEE
Oh but you are my dear

DINK
Oh c’mon ma That sucks buffalo
scro—

ELEMENO PEE
Think of it as punishment for
disobeying my rules regarding
profanity Again

DODGER
Youll be taking Harvey with you
as well

Dodger furiously shaking his head

DINK
Oh no Uh-uh I could cuss nonstop
from here ‘til Armageddon and not
deserve that

DODGER
I believe we need a brief word in
private

Elemeno and Dodger each snatch Dink by the collar and drag
him from the room

INT THE ORPHANAGE — GARAGE — NIGHT

Dink stands beside a large motorcycle flanked by twin
sidecars with Gatlin guns mounted on them as he straps on a
bright red crash helmet

Harvey skips in circles around Holden pink ears flopping
as he claps his hands

HARVEY
We’re going for a bike ride were
going for a bike ride Dink rhymes
with stink who can’t get it up for
pink and we’re going for a bike
ride

Dink spits on the ground

DINK

For the record I want everybody
within shouting distance to know
that THIS SUCKS ASS

(off Elemeno’s glare)
Oh stow it ma There’s nothing
else you can do short of
sodomizing me with the business
end of a rusty chainsaw that could
make this any worse

Dodger grins as he pats Dink on the head
DODGER

There there old chap If this
wasn’t of the utmost importance
DINK
Yeah yeah I know I got the
message Coincidentally here’s a
message for you and it concerns
crumpets and cramming them into
your pisshole

Dink flips Dodger the bird as Elemeno pulls Holden to the
side dodging the still-prancing Harvey

ELEMENO PEE
I want you to know we appreciate
you undertaking this task It
means a great deal to all of us

HOLDEN
WellI mean thanks and all but
I’m only going because I want to
go home All that matters right
now is my mom not having a nervous
breakdown because I’m gone and me
saying goodbye to my grandma No
offense or anything

Elemeno hugs Holden and musses his hair

ELEMENO PEE
Such a good boy

Dodger holds Harvey’s hand and leads him to one of the
sidecars

DODGER
Right then Harvey Hop on in
there’s a good bloke

Harvey plops into the sidecar and grabs the Gatlin gun
swiveling it around at the rest of the group Everybody
GASPS and ducks
Harvey grins ear to ear
HARVEY
Sheesh peeps The Harvey is

eccentric not a dummy

Dink climbs onto the motorcycle

DINK
Right and I can leap tall
buildings
(to Holden)
Well Waddaya waiting for an
invitation Get in

Holden climbs into the other sidecar Wyclef on his
shoulder and slides behind the Gatlin gun

Dodger clears his throat

DODGER
Well my friends the hour is upon
us The hour in which we change
the fate of all within our land
The hour in which we—

THHHHPPPPPTTT Harvey blows a loud raspberry
Dink kickstarts the motorcycle REVVING the ENGINE

DINK
What he said you long-winded
queef Now can the chatter and
let’s rock this bitch

Holden examines a magazine of silver bullets

HOLDEN
Uh guys What are these for

EXT HIGHWAY TO HELL — NIGHT

Hellena paces between a line of werewolves with Death and
the Hemingway twins her fingers clenched over her nose

HELLENA
What the devil are they waiting
for Do they not realize how much
waiting vexes me Not to mention
it reeks of a stable out here

DEATH
Perhaps they found alternate
passage dark lady

HELLENA
Poppycock This is the only route
that leads to the town of
Tavernacle which is where

FLIP FLOP

Everybody falls silent
FLIP FLOP FLIP FLOP
Mercutio sniffs the air

MERCUTIO
Alas something is rotten in
Denmark A foul stench hath
tainted the air

HELLENA
Of course it has you furry twit
There’s a hundred pounds of singed
bowel filth portioned about the
trees

PIPPI
Nope it’s not that It smells
like feet and Morlock blood

FLIP FLOP VROOOOOOM The ROAR of a MOTORCYLE tears
through the night

A single blinding headlight cuts through the dark causing
the werewolves to YELP from the intensity

Dink wearing goggles and his crash helmet YELLS like a
banshee

DINK
Let ‘er rip boys

BLAMBLAMBLAMBLAMBLAM BULLETS SCREAM into the night from
Harvey’s sidecar Gatlin gun

Werewolves YELP and HOWL and scramble as silver shreds
their fur and skin

Hellena charges forward wicked green light flaring up from
her staff

HELLENA
Hold your ground you miserable
fleabags There’s only two-and-a-
half of them

The werewolves pay her no mind scattering like leaves ina
wind

HELLENA
Death Destroy all that flee

Death claps his hands together THUNDER BELLOWS and
LIGHTNING CRACKS the sky

GREEN FIRE LANCES from Hellena’s staff toward the charging
motorcycle just as a sudden torrential RAIN PUMMELS the
highway causing Hellena to slip

HELLENA
Damn you Death

The green fire whizzes at Dink’s head glancing and melting
part of his helmet

DINK
Oh you dirty sack of whore

Holden hugs the sidecar for dear life as Harvey continues
to carve filets out of the disoriented werewolves with an
onslaught of silver bullets

SHOULDER OF HIGHWAY

A lone werewolf stops and licks a bleeding wound on its
leg

FLIP FLOP
Its ears perk up Its eyes wander to the ground
And fix on a pair of worn and empty flip-flops

BUDDY NINJA (0OS)
Good-bye meat

ZING A flash of silver

BUDDY NINJA (0S)
Hello happiness

And its head tumbles onto the highway

Followed by a healthy portion of torso Then a paw And a
lower jaw The butchered werewolves pile up like pancakes

HIGHWAY
Dink’s motorcycle speeds into a fallen werewolf using it
as a ramp and zooms into the air over and past Hellena

Green fire knifes by them igniting the night in fireworks

The motorcycle hits the ground running accelerating past
the melee with a SQUEAL of RUBBER

LIGHTNING SIZZLES into another group of werewolves leaving
a huge pile of scorched fur and flames

HELLENA
Death Cease fire

Another barrage of ELECTRICITY CRACKLES forth Rain streams
down the Wench Everlasting’s face as she surveys a pile of
decapitated and dismembered werewolves
HELLENA
Death damn you Stop before I

make you wish you were deader

In the distance the rumble of Dink’s motorcycle fades into
silence

FLIP FLOP

Hellena turns to the sound

There is nothing to see

EXT THE ORPHANAGE — FRONT PORCH — NIGHT

Dodger and Elemeno peer through spyglasses at the commotion
along the highway
ELEMENO PEE
Oh my that was close I do hope
they’re in good health

DODGER
Fear not my dear Elemeno Pee
Though they face grave danger and
peril

He lowers his spyglass and places his hand on Elemeno’s
shoulder

DODGER
You’ve molded Dink and Harvey into
fine men in their own right They
will they must pull through for
you and for all of us

Elemeno sighs and pats Dodger’s hand

ELEMENO PEE
I pray you’re right Dodger I
pray you’re right

EXT HIGHWAY TO HELL — FORK — NIGHT

The rows of flaming palm trees come to an abrupt halt at a
Y-intersection

Dink’s motorcycle tears up the black and red cobblestone
and SCREECHES to a halt at the fork in the road

Dink hops from the seat unbuckling his charred and half-
melted crash helmet

DINK
Oh my cock and balls was that
intense

He actually high-fives Harvey

DINK
Nice shooting For a guy that
can’t wipe his ass without
coaching that wasn’t half bad

He turns to Holden who climbs from his sidecar and scowls
as he folds his arms

HOLDEN
What No low-fives for me

DINK
Exactly how many rounds did you
manage to squeeze off back there
Oswald

HOLDEN
Do I look like Rambo to you I’m
not going to shoot anybody

DINK
Do you have any idea what those
things were back there

HOLDEN
I’m going to go with ‘Werewolves’
for five-hundred Alex Duh

DINK
Well smartass the only way to
get rid of werewolves before they
get rid of you is to SHOOT THEM
WITH SILVER FUCKING BULLETS

HOLDEN
I’m only 17 I’m in freaking high
school I don’t kill things that
shouldn’t exist

DINK
Then allow me to be the first in
line to tell you to grow up

HARVEY
Yeah grow the poop up Smartbutt

The Harvey needs to go number one

Harvey hops off to a patch of trees

DINK
I gotta piss like a three-dick dog
myself Then I gotta figure out
which forking road to take
Dink stomps off after Harvey

Holden glances up at Wyclef on his shoulder

HOLDEN
I can’t wait to get us home

Wyclef belches out a small burst of flame as Holden wanders
off to a patch of thicket

PATCH OF THICKET
Holden unzips his pants and takes a leak

Holden stops peeing turning to the sound

HOLDEN
Excuse me

He zips his pants back up and wanders toward the sound

HOLDEN

Sun Light

EXT SMALL CLEARING — NIGHT
Holden walks into an area of dried grass and dead branches

To the side of the area a cyborg PERSEPHONE 815 looking
a lot like the stewardess from Flight 815 is crouched on
her hands and knees She has a rubbery look about her as
if her skin isn’t quite real and one side of her face
droops and sags
HOLDEN
Hello Diddid you say
something

The non-droopy side of Persephone’s mouth moves slightly

PERSEPHONE 815
Sun Light

HOLDEN
Dink Harvey Get over here

A moment later Dink and Harvey crash through the
underbrush into the clearing

HARVEY
Here he comes to save the day

DINK
What the fuck are you hollering
about now
(then )
Oh Hey there Nice set of funbags
you got there sugar

HOLDEN
She keeps saying sunlight

Harvey skips over to her and places a couple of fingers on
her neck checking her pulse

DINK
What are you doing you retarded
pink pervert I saw her first

HARVEY
Ha The Harvey knew it She’s a
cyborg No place for Dinky to put
his winky Her battery’s dead and
she needs a jump

DINK
I’1l say she does And she’s

already in the right position

Holden groans

LATER

Dink stands in front of the idling motorcycle now parked in
the clearing holding jumper cables attached to its

battery

Dink laughs as

HOLDEN
What are you going to do with
those

DINK

She’s a cyborg dipshit Part
robot part person and generally
solar-powered So with there being
a big fat lack of sunshine
staying charged is a real pain in
the twat for them

(to Harvey )
All right Flopsy lift her shirt

HOLDEN
Whoa whoa hold on a sec You’re
gonna lift up her shirt I mean
don’t get me wrong she’s really
really pretty but isn’t that
like I don’t know date rape

Harvey grabs hold of Persephone’s shirt

DINK
I like the way you think kid And
what’s the matter Dontcha wanna
get a peak at her blouse bunnies

HARVEY
Haha Boo Bees

Harvey lifts the shirt revealing one black battery and one

red battery in place of breasts Dink attaches the cables

Holden grasps the gas and gives it a twist REVVING the

MOTOR

DINK
Give the bike some juice
Then Persephone’s eyes blaze electric blue and she jumps
into a standing position arms snapping upward catching
Dink and Harvey in the chest and sending them flailing
across the clearing

DINK
Turn it off Turn it off

Holden kills the engine as Persephone rips the jumper
cables from her torso the droop in her face now gone

PERSEPHONE 815
Charge complete Persephone 815
thanks you for your assistance

Dink and Harvey stagger over trying to shake out the
cobwebs

DINK
You gotta funny way of showing
thanks stovetop

PERSEPHONE 815
Many apologies Dink Ledbetter

DINK
How do you know my name

PERSEPHONE 815
I have been programmed with
detailed files of those deemed a
threat by the Nocturnal Wench
Everlasting

Twin shotguns appear in Dink’s hands cocked and ready

DINK
Come again

PERSEPHONE 815
I have been programmed with
detailed files of tho—

DINK
Oh for fuck’s sake I got that
Lucy Literal I meant am I still
‘deemed’ threatening

PERSEPHONE 815
Those files are no longer protocol
as my model of cybernetic upgrade
was discontinued years ago by the
Nocturnal Wench Everlasting

Dink relaxes and replaces his shotguns in their holsters
Holden points at Harvey

HOLDEN
Do you know his name

PERSEPHONE 815
The faux-rabbit’s name is Harvey

HOLDEN
What No last name

DINK
His name’s always been just Harvey
as long as I’ve known him

HARVEY
The Harvey is just Harvey Just
like Dink rhymes with stink

HOLDEN
Oh I get it Kinda like Madonna
Or Prince

DINK
Or Pussy

(then to Persephone)
Well glad I could help you out

make like my meat and beat it

PERSEPHONE 815

Persephone smiles all perfect pearly whites ZINK Her
teeth slide up into her gums
Dink’s mouth hits the ground

DINK
If I were back to normal my
funparts would be stricken with
rigor mortis right about now

HOLDEN
Back to normal Huh What’s that
supposed to mean

Dink clears his throat and climbs onto the motorcycle

DINK
Nothing We need to get outta here
before Hellena picks up our trail
so get your asses in the seats
Persephone You can ride
reacharound

EXT THE WHISKEY RIVER — NIGHT

Bourbon-colored WATER RUSHES in foaming rapids alongside a
dirt road

Dink’s motorcycle pulls up to a halt alongside the
riverbed Dink climbs off and fishes out the parchment map
from the folds of his vest

HOLDEN
Why are we stopping And why
didn’t we stay on the Highway to
Hell

DINK

Because assface you stay on the
Highway to Hell and where do you
think you eventually end up You
wanna go there I’d rather wait
til my bucket drops in and enjoy
the ride Now shut it so I can
figure out where we are

Harvey makes RAT-A-TAT-TAT sounds as he pretends to fire
the Gatlin gun

HARVEY
Yep Just like shooting salmon in
a large round container It smells
like Dink’s breath out here

HOLDEN
Yeah it does Or my uncle Lloyd at
Christmas

PERSEPHONE 815
My calculations indicate that the
river is made of 956 percent
Irish whiskey hence the
overpowering stench of wallowing
sorrow and holidays

Dink peruses the map After a moment he whips out a
spyglass and peers through it into the distance

He hands the spyglass to Persephone who passes it to
Holden

PERSEPHONE 815
I have binocular vision
capabilities Spyglasses are
obsolete

Holden peers into the miniature telescope
SPYGLASS

A few miles away a collection of buildings and streets
sits sandwiched between the river and a towering mountain

WHISKEY RIVER
Holden returns the spyglass

DINK
(shaking head)
Well this certainly bites my
swollen left ball According to
the map somewhere in that
stinking shithole of a town is
where our first key is
HARVEY
Oh boy the Harvey can go shopping
for socks Time willing of
course

HOLDEN
What’s the big deal Looks
deserted to me
Dink snorts and climbs back on the motorcycle
DINK
Right Deserted Let’s hope you’re

right for once

He wrenches the throttle and the group speeds off down the
road until they are a dot on the horizon

FLIP FLOP FLIP FLOP
Sandaled feet with black nail polish step into view

The silver blade of a samurai sword dips down to the road

pulling up a collection of dirt and dripped oil on its tip

The tip rises past a thick moustache to a nostril SNIFF
The dirt and oil disappear

Moonlight falls over the full figure of BUDDY NINJA (30s)
a tall powerfully built man complete with his flip-flops
a kilt sunglasses a greasy mullet and a sleeveless T-
shirt reading ‘WILL KILL FOR CEREAL’ across it

He adjusts a bandolier of silver shuriken slung across his
chest as the samurai sword zips into a scabbard strapped
across his back

FLIP FLOP FLIP FLOP He strides down the road flip-
flops kicking up dirt and pebbles

EXT TOWN OF TAVERNACLE — NIGHT
Holden Dink and Persephone stand at the outskirts of a

dilapidated collection of run-down buildings cracked
sidewalks and rusted overturned jalopies

Harvey does cartwheels in front of a worn wooden sign
reads WELCOME TO TAVERNACLE COME DRINK YOURSELF TO DEATH
POPULATION HELL YEAH

Holden glances up as Wyclef flies around above the group
CHITTERING and belching fire

HOLDEN
I wonder what his problem is

PERSEPHONE 815
He doesn’t like it here He says
it reeks of keg stands and
domestic violence

Holden shoots Persephone an arched eyebrow

HOLDEN
Detailed files

PERSEPHONE 815
That is affirmative Holden

Dink peruses the map

DINK
According to this piece of shit
we go straight down Bourbon Street
until we run intothe key I
guess

He crams the map into a pocket and walks back to the
motorcycle

DINK
Everybody get on so we can get
this over with

PERSEPHONE 815
That is not a wise idea

DINK
Neither is telling me it’s nota
wise idea
PERSEPHONE 815
I am detecting multiple lifeforms
scattered throughout the district
The town is inhabited

DINK
No shit gobble-my-crank-Shaft
That’s why I wanna blow right
through ThisSucksAssville before
we run into any welcome wagons

HOLDEN
Yeah but if we speed through we
might miss something

HARVEY
The Harvey still needs socks Oh
and bologna

Dink throws up his hands

DINK
Fine Whatever But I’m not
pushing the damn bike

Persephone grasps the handlebars and pushes it onto the
road

PERSEPHONE 815
The weight and mass of the vehicle
are of no consequence to me Let
us proceed

The group enters the town
LATER

The group is midway through town guided only by moonlight
and blue headlights shining from Persephone’s eyes

DINK
Boy I sure am glad we decided to
walk the whole livelong way Just
a fanfuckingtastic idea

SHRILL VOICE (0S)
(distant)
Woooo000000000

Everybody stops and looks around

HOLDEN
Um anybody else hear that

HARVEY
It sounds like fun

SHRILL VOICE (0S)
(closer)
Wooooo0o000

The group whirls around to the noise Persephone taps the
side of her head Her eyebeams intensify searching

And fall on a charging RAGING ALCOHOLIC a man covered with
assorted sores and boils sporting a hardhat equipped with
two bottles of whiskey and straws attached to his throat
He wears a T-shirt reading DRINK LIKE A CHAMPION TONIGHT

RAGING ALCOHOLIC
WOOOOO0O00000000000

He runs right at Harvey who leaps over him kicking him in
the ass as he does The Alcoholic goes tumbling head over
feet into a gutter whacking his head and SHATTERING the
BOTTLES on his hardhat

He bursts into tears

RAGING ALCOHOLIC

(slurring)
You sonsabitch I’m gonna kicks
your ash

The man burps and passes out his head striking the curb
and popping several boils in a burst of pus and goo

HOLDEN
(laughing)
Wow Now that sure was scary Go
back to Animal House you stupid
loser
CROWD (0S)
W0000000000000000

A huge stampeding CROWD of Raging Alcoholics storm down
the street various undead men and women of all states of
extreme inebriation all carrying liquor or beer
paraphernalia of some sort

DINK
Fuck me Raging Alcoholics

Rager 1 charges Persephone

RAGER 1
Hey candytits I lost my phone
number can I have yours

Persephone punches him in the face launching him some
twenty yards backward into the charging crowd like an
airborne bowling ball and scatters them across the street

Dink whips out his shotguns and races down the street

DINK
This way jackholes

The others don’t need a second invitation and race after
him

A female Rager careens in from the side pulling her shirt
up and flashing as she races toward Holden

FEMALE RAGER
Gimme some beads baaaaaaby

Holden slows just a bit Persephone scoops him up and
throws him over her shoulder and speeds away

PERSEPHONE 815
Perhaps she should buy you dinner
before allowing you on second
base

Another crowd tramples in from the northeast hooting and
yelling

RAGER 2
I am tore up from the floor up
wooooo

Dink raises a shotgun aims and FIRES

KABLAM An abandoned JALOPY EXPLODES into a huge ball of
flame enveloping the nearest herd of Raging Alcoholics and
sending them cartwheeling all over the place

Another female Rager clutching a bottle of booze and her
face covered in rotting skin sprints in a zigzag from an
alley and leaps onto Harvey’s back

FEMALE RAGER 2
Are your parents retarded Because
I think you’re special

Harvey twirls around in a circle trying to shake off his
inebriated passenger

HARVEY
(yelling)
Who’s got two thumbs and doesn’t
want your phone number Who’s got
two thumbs and doesn’t want your
phone number This guy This guy

Holden dashes over and snatches the bottle of rum from the
Rager’s grasp He upturns the bottle into his mouth as he
pulls Wyclef from his shoulder
More Ragers rush to the melee YIPPING and WHOOPING
RANDOM RAGER

You’re just a hammer and some duct

tape away from being a sure thing
Holden gives Wyclef a squeeze Fire belches from his maw
And Holden spews with all his might
Alcohol IGNITES into a huge stream of FLAME that hammers

into Harvey’s tagalong and BLASTS into the frenzied mob of
alcohol-soaked Ragers
KAABLAAAM They EXPLODE into a FIREBALL of booze and
blistered body parts as the concussive wave bowls Holden
and the rest of the gang twenty feet to the end of the
street straight into a pub

INT THE WAYWARD SUN — NIGHT

Holden tumbles into a dimly-lit pub along with the
remainder of the party in a mishmash of limbs and groans

DINK
Get your fuzzy pink ass outta my
face Harvey

HARVEY
The Harvey can’t He is stuck ina
position that would make Gumby
scream

HOLDEN
Aw Dink you’re crotch smells like
rotten milk

DINK
So did the last piece of tang I
tapped Let’s just say she had a
lot in common with hockey players
when it came to showering habits

Persephone untangles herself from the mess and bolts the
front door shut as everybody untangles themselves

Fists and bottles HAMMER at the thick oak from outside

HOLDEN
What are we going to do now It’s
like shopping the day after
Thanksgiving out there

DINK
Shut up and let me think for a
sec

Dink pops more silver shells into his shotguns

HARVEY
Uh oh

HOLDEN
What I hope it’s not about socks
Or bologna

Harvey points to the far end of the room as Persephone
steps in line beside them

PERSEPHONE 815
It appears we are not alone

INT HELLENA’S RV — NIGHT

Hellena sits in her throne observing the wall of crystal
orbs showing various angles of WOO-HOOING Raging Alcoholics
chasing the RV and throwing various objects at it

Hellena presses the eyeball intercom

HELLENA
Oh Death

INT DEATHS PALE HORSE (MOVING) — NIGHT

Death’s crimson eyes stare from his shadowy cowl as BOTTLES
SHATTER against the vehicle and mashed drunken drooling
faces press against the windows

HELLENA
(over intercom)
Death you worm-ridden cadaver
answer me

A bony finger jabs at the intercom button

DEATH
Driving is a little stressful at
the moment dark lady Perhaps a
more opportune time could be
suggested

HELLENA
I don’t give a flying monkey crap
Get us out of here this instant

DEATH
What about the werewolves Can’t
they do something besides
disregard their own feces or
sniffing their behinds for once

HELLENA
I’ve already sent them the long
way round so shut your maggot-hole
and do as I command If we don’t
catch that little brat soon I’m
going to see to it that—

Death grumbles flips off the speaker and throws the truck
into ‘Park’

EXT TOWN OF TAVERNACLE — NIGHT — SAME

The driver-side door of the Bronco swings open and Death
climbs out He swings a skeletal arm at an unruly crowd of
Ragers and they fall over dead

His arms spin about in circles and he SNAPS his FINGERS

A gargantuan sign appears over a large building across the
street ELECTRICITY CRACKLING in bright blue streaks across
its face

Until it reconfigures into ‘LAST CALL FOR ALCOHOL’ in
blinking letters

WAILS of dismay bellow out from the Ragers and they bolt
toward the building in unison

Death raises his arms over his head hands clenched in a
sign of victory

DEATH
And the crowd applauds Death with
enthusiastic fervor for once again
proving his brilliant innovation
in a dire situa—

THWACK THUNK

Death’s gaze wanders down to the street where his now
dismembered arms hands still clasped together twitch and
jump

FLIP FLOP FLIP FLOP

Death stands stock still head hung low merely staring at
his amputated writhing limbs

INT THE WAYWARD SUN — NIGHT

BARTENDER IKE (50s) oily-looking with narrow shoulders and
an impressive beer-gut steps out from behind a mahogany
bar a cricket bat clutched in his hands

Two CYCLOPS bouncers flank him giant and rippling with
muscle each armed with a set of barstools

Holden and the others glance at each other in a rather
nervous fashion

DINK
I wonder if those Cyclops’ one-
eyed trouser snakes only have one
eye Or do you think that they
have two to make up for—

PERSEPONE 815
I believe silence would be golden
at the present time Dink

Holden takes a tentative step forward

HOLDEN
Uh sorry to barge in like this on
you and your nice establishment
sir and uhsirs We were just
you know leaving and all

Ike pounds the cricket bat into a meaty hand

BARTENDER IKE
Leaving Well I’m afraid you
can’t leave junior See the
Raging Alcoholics will rip the lot
(MORE )

BARTENDER IKE (CONT’D)
of you to highball shreds and use
you for chasers if you venture
back outside Besides

Ike fishes into his apron and pulls out a large golden
skeleton key

BARTENDER IKE
I the world famous bartender Ike
have something that belongs to
you

INT DEATHS PALE HORSE — NIGHT
An armless Death sits in the passenger seat of the cab

Hellena sits beside him clutching the steering wheel and
working the gas and brakes looking less than pleased

HELLENA
How How Death How the blazes do
you get your arms chopped off
You’re a chauffeur

DEATH
I beg your pardon dark lady but
I resent that I have commandeered
a pristine gondola through the
black waters of the River Styx for
the past two millennia

HELLENA
‘Commandeered’ my sorcerous ass
You were a river guide ina
tourist trap for fifty cents a
trip I hired you as my driver
damnit

Death gestures to the passenger window with his head

DEATH
Take a left here dark lady And I
cannot help it if my extremities
were severed it was most
unexpected Oh and I’‘1l1 be

DEATH (CONT’D)
meeting with the Gravedancer’s
Union to discuss my Workers’ Comp
upon our return FYI

EXT DEATH’S PALE HORSE - NIGHT

The passenger door flails open followed by a BURST of
GREEN FIRE and Death catapulting from the vehicle onto the
street

A horde of YOWLING RAGERS immediately sets upon him and
before long Death crowd surfs across Bourbon Street as the
Bronco ROARS away

INT THE WAYWARD SUN — NIGHT

Holden a look of confusion on his face exchanges glances
with Dink

HOLDEN
Come again

Ike motions to the two one-eyed bouncers and they retreat
to the sides of the bar

BARTENDER IKE
This key has been locked behind my
bar for nearly forty years I was
instructed to give it to the next
minor that tried to come into my
pub and proved himself worthy And
since you look about five years
short of a six-pack I’d say I’ve
found the winner winner TV
dinner

Holden shrugs and reaches for the key

HOLDEN
Well that was easy

Ike snatches the key back
BARTENDER IKE
You forgot about the ‘proved
himself worthy’ portion of the
story junior I’m afraid there’s
a little taproom challenge for you
to get through first

HOLDEN
Is it by chance anything involving
the use of an X-Box 360

HARVEY
The Harvey hopes it’s a madcap
game of Go Fish

Ike regards Harvey with a frown

BARTENDER IKE
Is he retarded or something

HARVEY
The Harvey is eccentric chubby
innkeeper And smart as a whip
(cracks imaginary whip)
WOO-PSSSSH Rawhide

Dink pushes past Harvey

DINK
So what’s the damn challenge I
wanna get outta this gin joint and
pronto

Ike walks to a set of double-doors at the far side of the
room and pulls them open

IKE
Follow me all of you

INT THE WAYWARD SUN — PRIVATE ROOM — NIGHT

Ike walks into the back room followed by Holden Wyclef
Dink Persephone and Harvey Mirrors with odd beer logos
adorn all free space A long lavender curtain covers the
farthest wall

An enormous beast of a man KEG HELLWIG all legs stomach
chest and bushy mohawk sits in the center of the room at a
table dwarfed by his massive frame He CHOMPS on an entire

side of beef snapping through meat and bones with ease

He sees Ike and rips out a BURP with the force of a wind
tunnel

KEG
What are you disturbing my din-din
for Ike I’m hungry as a starvin’
mastodon in heat and don’t take
kind to interruptions

BARTENDER IKE
Folks meet The Wayard Sun’s Keg
Hellwig champion drinker of the
town of Tavernacle He is also
your challenge this evening

DINK
Please tell me the challenge is
hula-hooping or fitting into a
single-digit dress size

BARTENDER IKE
To gain possession of the golden
key you must best Keg ina
contest of alcohol consumption

Holden busts out LAUGHING

HOLDEN
A drinking contest I’m not even
old enough to vote And the only
thing I’ve ever even drunk is
Boone’s Farm mixed with Koolaid

PERSEPHONE 815
Then your probability of success
based on estimated weight and
alcohol tolerance is eight-point-—
seven million to one I don’t like
your chances
HARVEY
The Harvey doesn’t dig them
either

Holden throws his hands up in defeat

HOLDEN
What the hell kind of challenge is
this Why don’t you ask me to see
who can fill up a lunchbox with
their own crap first which I never
tried to do in ninth grade

IKE
Now easy there junior I didn’t
say you had to outdrink him
You’re still a minor and I don’t
want to lose my liquor license
You may choose one of your party
in your stead Oh except for the
cyborg

HOLDEN
Why not

PERSEPHONE 815
My circuits detect alcohol as a
waste product and instantly filter
it from my system thereby giving
me an unfair advantage

HOLDEN
Oh Right I wasn’t going to pick
her anyway

He smiles as his eyes fall on Dink

LATER

Dink stands in his chair at the table across from Keg
man surrounded by overturned shot glasses and bottles of

liquor as the rest of the group watches

each

Keg picks up a shot a whacks it back them SMASHES the GLASS

on the table

Keg speaks in a series of incoherent hiccups garbled slurs
and grunts

KEG
(subtitled)
So who’s the hot piece of cyborg
ass

Dink’s lingual skills aren’t much better

DINK
(subtitled)
That’s Persephone She wants some
of the Dink Dong in her exit door

Keg slings back another shot

KEG
Bullshit She does not

Dink does the same

DINK
No honestly it’s true She wants
to nibble on my dick like a rat
does cheese

KEG
(another shot)
Whatever short-pour You wouldn’t
know what to do with it if you got
near it Besides why would she
want a spark plug when she can get
the whole engine from me

Dink does another shot Then BAWLS like a baby

DINK
Oh you’re right it’s true I
can’t even get my goodies up to
show her a Dink-tacular time
between the sheets I havent been
able to pitch a tent in six years
My balls throb constantly

Everybody looks at each other in utter confusion over the
indecipherable conversation Holden whispers something in
Persephone’s ear She shrugs and whispers something back in
his

Keg holds up a shot glass and giggles drool cascading down
his chin

KEG
Then here’s to me being the first
give her an oil check with my
foot-long pechhhhrrrraaaallllffff

Keg launches groceries all over the table then passes out
face-first into the table SNAPPING it in half He CRACKS
his FOREHEAD off the floor with a bounce and doesn’t move

Dink throws back one last shot unzips his pants and pees
everywhere

DINK
I win Bitches

Ike carefully walks over and raises Dink’s non-aiming hand

BARTENDER IKE
The dwarf is victorious Most
impressive I daresay

DINK
(barely decipherable)
Fuck you you tubby-titted spooge
rag That’s my name in piss on
your floor I wish it was in
Persephone’s handwriting

He stumbles out of the chair stream of urine still going
and falls on the floor as he GUFFAWS

FRONT ROOM

WUMP Something big and heavy RATTLES the DOORS of the
front room

Ike peeks his head out of the private room and motions to
the two Cyclops bouncers They rush over and brace
themselves against the doors

PRIVATE ROOM

Ike hurries back to Holden and places the golden skeleton
key in his hand

BARTENDER IKE
You best hurry junior

PERSEPHONE 815
What is Holden supposed to unlock
with that

HOLDEN
Yeah what she said

Ike strides over to the far wall and yanks down the
curtain revealing an iron door with a large keyhole in its
center

BARTENDER IKE
Pretty self-explanatory no

HOLDEN
What’s behind the door

BARTENDER IKE
I’m guessing an exit

HOLDEN
What you never opened it

BARTENDER IKE
Alas the key only works for the
one who may wield it

Dink struggles up from the floor staggers a few feet then
falls back on his back

DINK
I need my goddamn motorcycle I
can’t walk

FRONT ROOM
KERAAAASH The front WINDOW SHATTERS in a hurricane of

glass as Dink’s motorcycle careens into the bar and skids
across the floor into the

PRIVATE ROOM

It spins to a halt in a heap of twisted charred metal
beside Dink

DINK
I need a new goddamn motorcycle I
still can’t walk
WHOOPING and crazy YELLING sound from the
FRONT ROOM
Ragers pour in through the busted front window as the
Cyclops bouncers scatter them like leaves in the wind with
powerful swings from their barstools
PRIVATE ROOM
Holden runs to the iron door followed by a hopping Harvey
Persephone scoops up Dink and throws him over her shoulder
PERSEPHONE 815
We should vacate the premises

immediately

HOLDEN
I couldn’t agree more

Holden jams the key into the lock and turns it The DOOR
GROANS open on rusted hinges The ROAR of RUSHING WATER
fills the room

Holden holds the door open and waves everybody through

HOLDEN
Come on let’s go

EXT WHISKEY RIVER — BALANCE BRIDGE — NIGHT
A small ledge juts out over the churning rapids of the
river below A narrow beam no more then four inches wide

stretches across fifty yards of angry water

Persephone sprints out Dink on her shoulder and wastes no
time crossing the river on the beam with her precise steps

Harvey leaps out and cartwheels onto the length of wood
bunny hopping across the water with no problem

Holden dashes out last and stops just short of the beam
nearly going over the edge of the ledge

HOLDEN
Holy Thundercat balls

Holden gulps and looks back over his shoulder to where
scores of Raging Alcoholics have swarmed into the back
room

And are coming right for him

HOLDEN
Fuck I wish I hadn’t flunked gym

He takes a deep breath and places one foot in front of the
other steadily making his way over the swirling waters

He makes it about fifteen yards before the Ragers figure
out how to exit the building and come after him

RAGERS
WOOOOOO0O000000 WEEEEEEEE

They careen onto the balance beam making it a scant few
feet before slipping and tripping into the river below like
drunk lemmings

Holden risks a quick look over his shoulder and sees what’s
happening

HOLDEN
Ha Quit drinking you assholes and
maybe you’ll pass a sobriety test
or twoWHOOOOAAAA-SHIT

He loses his footing and lurches from the beam limbs
flailing Wyclef SCREECHES and tries to secure his collar

to no avail as Holden falls

And abruptly stops He opens his eyes and looks up

Persephone clutches him by the ankle and pulls him up to
safety She slings him over her shoulder and sprints back
to the far side

INT THE WAYWARD SUN — BAR — NIGHT

Ike raises his head from a hiding place behind the bar All
is quiet save for the two Cyclops bouncers standing near
the door breathing heavily

Ike walks out from behind the bar and approaches the
bouncers holding his cricket bat behind his back

BARTENDER IKE
Are all those crazy shitfaced
bastards gone

CYCLOPS 1
(subtitled)
Yes they’re all freaking gone
You said nothing about having to
fight the whole damn city at one
time when we applied here

CYCLOPS 2
(subtitled)
I want my fucking break And a
raise

WAK WAK Two swift swings from Ike SPLINTERS the BAT and
drops the creatures into an unconscious heap

BARTENDER IKE
Sorry about that lads but I’ve
waited too long for this and I’m
not about to let a wet-behind-the-
ears tossed salad get what should
be mine

Ike snatches a rucksack and an overcoat from a nearby peg
on the wall and strides back to the

PRIVATE ROOM

He rushes to the still-open iron door putting on the coat
and backpack

Suddenly he trips and goes down in a heap He struggles to

his knees eyes darting searching for the culprit
responsible for his spill

Then his eyes stop

On the pair of empty flip-flops sitting by the doorway

EXT WHISKEY RIVER — THE OTHER SIDE — NIGHT

Persephone crosses the balance beam Holden slung over
shoulder and steps onto the bank opposite the town of
Tavernacle She sets him down next to a passed-out and
SNORING like a gutted wild yak Dink

Harvey lies on his back scissoring his arms and legs
making dirt angels in thedirt

her

In the distance a foreboding forest stands its swaying

LIMBS WHISPERING in the night

A lone water pump stands in the clearing where the party

regroups

HOLDEN
Holy sea donkey ass that was
close I thought I was dead

Holden throws his arms around Persphone and kisses her
cheek

Mid-kiss he seems to remember how pretty Persephone is and

turns bright red tucking his hands in his pockets

HOLDEN
Uh sorry I just you know had to
then I uh sorry Sorry

Persephone actually smiles and returns the favor

PERSEPHONE
I hope you won’t mind if I’m short
on apologies

HARVEY
Get a room why dontcha The
Harvey does not want cooties
HOLDEN
(mumbling)
Oh shut up Harvey just
jealous

Persephone walks over to the unconscious Dink and reaches
into his vest and retrieves unfolds and peruses his map

Holden stoops over the dwarf and grabs a boot

HOLDEN
(to Harvey )
Can you give me a hand with him
Let’s get him under the pump and
hose him down wake him up and
whatnot

Harvey hops over and grabs the other boot The two of them
drag him across the ground and drop him under the nozzle of
the water pump

PERSEPHONE 815
This is somewhat confusing

HOLDEN
What’s that

PERSEPHONE 815
According to this map we are
right on top of the next key

HOLDEN
Well where do we go to get it

A BRANCH SNAPS behind them Mercutio and Pippi step from
the darkness followed by a score of slobbering werewolves

MERCUTIO
Thou shalt not be going anywhere
to retrieve anything vile wretch
Stayeth thine course or be
smitten

PIPPI
You know sometimes I wanna just
kick you in the nads
MERCUTIO
Pray tell why mine kindred

DINK (0S)
Because

The group turns to Dink who staggers to his feet

DINK
You babble like a constipated
Shakespeare without the pizzazz
furdick

Mercutio bares his fangs and SNARLS

PIPPI
Don’t talk to my brother that way
you stacked up pieces of goat
crap I can’t wait to rip the
flesh from your face and snack on
your heart

In a flash Dink’s shotguns are out cocked and aimed

DINK
I’m thinking that’s gonna be a
tough one to pull off

MERCUTIO
(sneering)
And what dost thou plan to do
about it

DINK
Why telleth thou to go fucketh
thyself

KABLAM KABLAM Twin BLASTS from the SHOTGUNS decimates
Mercutio and Pippi’s heads into bloody messes of skull and
pulp that SPLATTER the remaining wolves The headless body
sloughs to the ground

Beat

The twenty other werewolves HOWL and charge as one

HARVEY
Oh me oh my

Harvey backpedals and his rear strikes the handle on the
water pump

And opens a hidden trapdoor CLICK Dink Harvey
Persephone Holden and Wyclef disappear into the ground

INT ARCANE ARCADE — CHUTE FIRST — NIGHT

Everybody YELLS and SCREAMS in unison as they rocket down a
twisting and winding tunnel coated with black goo

INT ARCANE ARCADE — HALL OF BALLS — NIGHT

The group flies out of the chute into a dimly lit corridor
filled with various shapes and sizes of strange mushy
balls and dip underneath the bobbing grossness

Harvey pops up into view first face cover in black slime
and two small purple orbs attached to his chin followed by

Persephone and Holden

Wyclef glides about the hall then suddenly takes a dive
into the spherical mess and yanks up a SPUTTERING Dink

Dink catches his breath and catches sight of Harvey and
LAUGHS

HOLDEN
What’s so damn funny

DINK
He looks like a blowjob

Harvey swipes at his chin knocking the balls away
HARVEY
The Harvey does not appreciate the
ribbing Also it reeks of sweat
and funk in here

GROWLS and SNARLS sound from the shoot

PERSEPHONE

We must flee this corridor The
werewolves are immediately behind
us

DINK
Wow you don’t state the constant
obvious in the least whatsoever

Everybody hurriedly slogs through the pile of mishmash
globes holding their noses until they reach a single open
window its end

The GROWLS and SNARLS are ever closer

Wyclef flies right on through Persephone boosts Dink
Holden and Harvey through then pulls herself up and in

INT ARCANE ARCADE — WHACK-ATTACK ROOM — NIGHT

The group pick themselves up all covered in black muck and
disgusting slime

A huge wall-to-wall trampoline stretches out in front of
them A dozen wide holes stand in a row on the ceiling

HARVEY
The Harvey needs a bath
(sniffs)
He also recommends one for
everybody else

RRROOOOWWWRR A werewolf’s head crams into the window JAWS
SNAPPING and saliva flying as it tries to squeeze through

Dink nonchalantly points a sawed-off shotgun over his
shoulder KABLAM The creature’s head EXPLODES in a mess of
gore and brain

HOLDEN
Wow That wasnasty Does
anybody have a clue where we are

A voice deep booming and gravelly echoes from the
ceiling holes throughout the room

WELCOME TO THE ARCANE ARCADE ALL
PLAYERS MUST EVADE MJOLNIR HAMMER
OF ETERNAL NAPTITUDE TO ESCAPE
THANK YE FOR PLAYING

WAM A massive object strikes one of the holes on the
topside of the ceiling momentarily blacking it out and
raining dust and bits of stone into the room

WAM The same thing happens to another hole several spaces
down

HOLDEN
That sounds kinda not good

WAM Another one

DINK
By chance does anybody know how to
teleport

WAM Persephone shines her blue eye-lights over the walls

PERSEPHONE 815
There appear to be no other exits
save the openings in the ceiling

WAM Every time a different hole blacks out as if covered
by a massive lid

THOR THE TINY (0S)
YE WILL ALL BE SMITED LIKE FLIES
TO A SWATTER SO SAYETH THOR THE
TINY UNTO THEE

DINK
Sheesh I thought I just killed
Mercutio

WAM Harvey hops onto the trampoline catching a ton of
air

HOLDEN
Harvey what are you doing

HARVEY
The Harvey has this all figured
out He insists you not get your
panties in a wad

Then just like that Harvey hops way up and out of one of
the nada-skylights

WAM He reappears dropping in through a different hole a
large grin plastered on his face A few bounces and he
vaults out again

DINK
What the hell is that gimp doing

WAM Harvey drops back in and hops back to the side with
the rest of the group

HARVEY
The Harvey thinks that was most
exhilarating Oh and there is a
very very enormous giant with a
hammer up there Very dangerous

PERSEPHONE 815
And a high probability of being
flattened to death

HOLDEN
Detailed files

PERSEPHONE 815
Common sense

HARVEY
The Harvey says there’s nothing to
fear He has figured out the
pattern

And without waiting for the okay Harvey snatches up Dink
and leaps back onto the trampoline

DINK
What the shit you stupid mother—

The duo disappears through the ceiling

A moment later Harvey reappears and grabs Persephone

Then finally Holden and Wyclef leap into the air with
Harvey and zips up into the stone just as werewolves
squeeze through the window

INT ARCANE ARCADE — THOR’S LAIR — NIGHT

Harvey clutching Holden and his iguana spirals high into
a sprawling cave

Right past the gargantuan iron hammer held by a blonde
bearded giant THOR THE TINY some 30-feet tall with
redwood legs and oak arms

WAM The HAMMER POUNDS the floor with bone-crushing force
and a YELP as it catches a stray werewolf flying into the
room WAM YELP Then another And another

Harvey lands on a ridge above Thor’s head and sets Holden
down next to Persephone and Dink

DINK
Who knew the pink-assed imbecile
would turn out to be an idiot

savant

HARVEY
The Harvey is also an excellent
driver

Holden walks over to a thick metal door on the ridge and
gives it a tug Nothing doing

PERSEPHONE 815
I have already attempted to pass
the obstruction to no avail

HOLDEN
Then how do we get out of here

WAM YELP SNARL
THOR THE TINY

ATTEMPT AT PASSAGE IS FUTILE UNDER
THOR THE TINY’S MIGHTY HAMMER

PERSEPHONE 815
It is inconsequential at the
moment how we escape What is of
consequence is the giant’s left
ear

Holden glances down through the mane of blonde hair

HOLDEN
What do you mean his left
(squints )
Oh shit a brick It’s the second
key As an earring How George
Michael of him

DINK
Nothing gets by you Nancy Drew

HOLDEN
Well then smartass how are we
going to get it

WAM Then barely discernible between hammer-whacks and
wolf-squealing FLIP FLOP FLIP FLOP

Out of nowhere Buddy Ninja vaults into the air all kilt
mullet and samurai sword hacking werewolves into pieces as
he somersaults and spins

He disappears back into the floor

And leaps back up hurling a barrage of silver shuriken
into Thor’s forehead

Thor ROARS in pain
THOR THE TINY
YE AND YOUR HILLBILLY HAIRCUT

SHALL PAY

Thor swings his hammer through the air missing Buddy by
scant inches

HOLDEN
Oh

DINK
Fuckballs

The group dives aside as Thor’s hammer WHOOSHES over them
and ricochets off the iron door for another swipe at the
twirling Buddy Ninja

On his next pass Buddy whizzes by Thor’s ear and at his
apex throws something at Holden

BUDDY NINJA
Catch

The golden key hits Holden in the hands and ricochets right
off of them and tumbles down into the cave

In a flash Wyclef zips from his shoulder and dives
snagging the key from the SNAPPING JAWS of a bouncing
werewolf as shuriken impale its throat before Thor’s hammer
whacks it across the cavern like a furry baseball

Wyclef swoops up onto Holden’s shoulder and drops the key
into his hand

HOLDEN
Attaboy Wyclef

Wyclef belches fire in response as the mayhem in the cave
ensues at a breakneck pace

DINK
What are we waiting for I’m
thinking a combination of ‘Dodge’
and ‘get the fuck out of’ isa
damn skippy idea

Holden glances out at Thor the werewolves and the diving
and dodging Buddy Ninja

HOLDEN
But what about him He’ll get
killed out there

DINK
And he deserves it
Buddy this time running along the cave wall seeming to
defy gravity turns to Holden

BUDDY NINJA
Leave this place jackals This is
my meat my murder my mayhem My
happiness

The samurai sword flashes more shuriken fly
Holden relents and jams the key into the door’s keyhole
EXT CAVERN — NIGHT

In front of the cavern mouth swirling snow and wind RIP
across a vast frozen lake as Holden and crew shiver and
take in the scenery

Low indiscernible but angry-sounding WHISPERS resonate
from behind the flurries and gusts

HOLDEN
I sure am glad I don’t have any
gloves Or testicles anymore for
that matter

DINK
Id say not a lot has changed
since you got here

PERSEPHONE 815
(off map)
According to the map we are
entering the Winter of Discontent
which we must traverse to reach
the final key

HOLDEN
Couldn’t be Summer of Lovin’ or
Spring Fling or something happy
for a change could it This
sucks

Harvey flops on his back and makes snow angels

DINK
Why don’t you quit acting like a
Corky and get the hell up

HARVEY
The Harvey thinks Dink’s always
angry because Dink’s equipment is
on the fritz

DINK
Hey shut up That’s none of your
goddamn business

Holden laughs maniacally

HOLDEN
Yeah whatever Kenny Can’t-Get-It-
Up You’re always bragging about
partying with the ladies when you
can’t even raise your roof

DINK
Who the hell told you that

HOLDEN
Persephone translated for me back
in the bar when you were moaning
about it to that Keg dude like a
little girl with cramps

DINK
And what do you know about cramps
The closest you’ve ever come to
getting ass is pin-the-tail-on-
the-donkOOOMPH

Holden kicks Dink right in the ding-ding lifting him clear
off the ground and dropping him into the fetal position

DINK
(gasping)
Going To Kill YOU

PERSEPHONE 815
Boys we need to relax This is
the weather affecting you try to

PERSEPHONE 815 (CONT’D)
clear your thoughts of irrational
anger

DINK
Lick my dingleberry ass Susie
Sellout What the hell’s the
weather got to do with the price
of pussy in Amsterdam

Persephone snatches Dink up by the collar

PERSEPHONE 815
I wonder The Winter of
Discontent Sometimes your skills
involving applied logic are quite
impressive

She twirls around in a blur holding Dink like a discus
and flings him onto the frozen lake He hits the ice as if
shot out of a cannon and blasts across the ice spinning
and cursing as he goes

HARVEY
Now that looks like funexcept
for the ice cold behind

Persephone grabs Harvey and slings him out after Dink
HOLDEN
Don’t think about touching me you

spit-swapping earthquake-whore

Persephone pays him no mind and tosses him across the lake
as well Wyclef clinging to his shoulder for dear life

INT THOR THE TINY’S LAIR — NIGHT

Green FIRE ERUPTS through the holes in the cavern floor as
Hellena levitates into the room

A wave of her staff and the fire dissipates She gives the
room a once-over

Thor the Tiny sits in a far corner of the cave staring in
a huge mirror a goofy grin plastered on his face which is
riddled with dozens of shuriken

THOR THE TINY
I AM DEVASTATINGLY HANDSOME THIS
NEW FACIAL JEWELRY IS MOST
FETCHING DAMSELS SHALL BE WOOED
INTO MY QUARTERS WITH EASE

Hellena scowls off all of the smooshed werewolf corpses
strewn about the cavern

HELLENA
You look like you’ve been struck
in the face with a tackle box you
overgrown lummox

Thor pays her no mind as he continues ogling his
reflection

HELLENA
Death Hurry it up

BOING Death bounces into the room his armless person
landing beside Hellena before drunkenly staggering face-
first into a column of stone

He wobbles away from the pillar

DEATH
Oh so you want a piece of me
huh You know I can kill you with
a snap of my fingers

He glances down at his limp and empty sleeves

DEATH
Aw H-E-double-hockey-sticks
(beat)
Does this place have karaoke

HELLENA
Damn you you inebriated buffoon
At least tell me that the serial
killer is dead

Death squeezes eyes shut BELCHES out a swarm of LOCUSTS
and shakes his head

DEATH
(hiccups )
Nope I’m afraid he’s still alive
and killing

Hellena strides across the cavern

HELLENA
So be it

EXT CARNIVORIUM EMPORIUM - ENTRANCE — NIGHT

Crumbled remnants of bone litter the ground in front of a
towering rusted iron gate where the snow and wind cease as
if held off by an invisible wall

In archaic lettering atop the gate CARNIVORIUM EMPORIUM

Dink slides off the ice and tumbles head over heels through
the scattered bone

He regains his feet and brushes himself off

DINK
I swear I’m gonna kickstart that
girl’s trunk into next FUCK

Dink collapses back to the ground as Harvey rams into him

HARVEY
Whoa Nellie The Harvey’s buttocks
are number than your sexual
conquests

DINK
Why don’t you wear your ass for a

hat ‘til next Easter

Dink tries to get up one more time and is abruptly reseated
as Holden bowls over him

DINK
GODDAMNIT

Persephone zips in right behind Holden
PERSEPHONE 815
Well Now that we’re out of the
storm animosity should return to
a normal level

DINK
Piss off you lawnmower in woman’s
clothing

HOLDEN

Hey I gotta question before we go
into this

(off sign)
Emporium of whatever Who the hell
was the mullet-dude in the kilt
back in that whack-a-mole cave

Dink Harvey and Persephone exchange uneasy glances

PERSEPHONE 815
That was Buddy Ninja alleged mass
murderer of Spectre Leaf

Harvey snorts

HARVEY
The Harvey thinks that would be
the same as saying Dink allegedly
suffers from impotence

Dink WHACKS Harvey in the back of the knee with his
shotgun buckling his leg

DINK
Jeff Gilooly ain’t got shit on me

Harvey rolls to his feet and rabbit punches Dink in the
kidney

DINK
Oof Son of a bitch

HOLDEN
So he’s dangerous

PERSEPHONE 815
I daresay he is rumored to be Why
do you ask

FLIP FLOP FLIP FLOP

HOLDEN
Because he’s right behind you

Persephone and everybody else follows Holden’s gaze

Sure enough Buddy Ninja stands just in front of the
invisible barrier keeping the Winter of Discontent at bay
blood-soaked samurai sword in hand

The GROAN of the rusty gate opening sounds behind
everybody

NIGHT MAYOR
Fear him not lady and gentlemen
He means you no harm

All eyes fall on a whip-thin wisp of a bespectacled man
THE NIGHT MAYOR (50s) standing in front of the
Carnivorium’s entrance He also wields a 50 caliber
machine gun and criss-crossed bandoliers of silver bullets

HOLDEN
Is that because you’re going to
blow us all away with that Jesse
Ventura Predator gun first

NIGHT MAYOR
Nay Holden Tucker It is because
he works for me He’s beenwell
protecting you

Dink whips his shotguns out

DINK
Bullshit The urban legend on this
dress-wearing fashion fuck-up goes
back some twenty years And who
the fuck are you

NIGHT MAYOR
I am the Night Mayor of Spectre
Leaf And surely you do not put
much stock in the local sewing
circle around here concerning back
alley myths do you

PERSEPHONE 815
Are you implying he is not a mass
murderer

NIGHT MAYOR

He’s more of a blade for hire
Assassination is his art The
underbelly of Spectre Leaf is his
canvas Regardless he is under my
employ and will harm you not

(beat)
But if you’1ll come with me I can
show you the way to the last
golden key before the Wench
Everlasting shows

The Night Mayor wheels around and strides through the gate

The group glances between him and the rather ominous-—
looking Buddy

They opt for the gate
INT CARNIVORIUM EMPORIUM — TICKET BOOTH — NIGHT

Balls of spiderwebs tumble through the dusty streets past
rows of decrepit buildings and cracked sidewalks

The Night Mayor stops in front of a row of metal
turnstiles Buddy Ninja flip-flops his way to the front of
the group standing beside the Mayor sunglasses glinting
darkly

NIGHT MAYOR
So before we enter the

Carnivorium we need to

He trails off as multiple hands shoot up in the air

NIGHT MAYOR
Uhare there questions

DINK
What do you think Mayor McCheese
Why the thunderfuck should we go
anywhere with you

NIGHT MAYOR
Because we all seek to achieve the
same goal finding the Caretaker
and securing Pandora’s Hope Chest

HOLDEN
I hate to ask the obvious but why
haven’t you done this already
Especially since you’re like the
Mayor of Night or whatever

NIGHT MAYOR
Have you not been paying attention
on your journey Mr Tucker Only
you may secure and use each of the
keys Should anyone else attempt
they would perish in a rather
painful manner

PERSEPHONE 815
Then where is the key located

The Night Mayor offers a wry grin and makes a sweeping
motion to the buildings behind the turnstiles

NIGHT MAYOR
The Carnivorium is our oyster The
key is our pearl

HOLDEN
What’s in the Chest

NIGHT MAYOR
It’s all in the name Mr Tucker
Hope Hope for all of Spectre
Leaf How it shall transpire I
know not But I believe in hope
for hope is the strongest magic in
this world and all worlds

HANDS CLAP from behind everybody

They whirl to see Hellena and a dozen werewolves standing
at the gated entrance

HELLENA (0S)
That was so heartfelt it nearly
brought tears to my eyes

Death shambles up behind her with a set of huge furry bear
arms and paws sticking out of the sleeves of his robes

HELLENA
(hissing)
Where the blazes have you been

DEATH
(hiccups )
What I killed a bear I’m
practicing the Second Amendment

The Night Mayor raises his machine gun

NIGHT MAYOR
Are you prepared Buddy

BUDDY NINJA
The masses are meat Meat is
murder Murder is mayhem And
mayhem is happiness

HELLENA
Then allow me to rain on your
parade

Her staff blazes alight with blinding green fire

NIGHT MAYOR
RUN

He squeezes the trigger of his machine gun and a barrage of
SILVER SCREAMS through the night at the werewolves slicing
through several of them in a maelstrom of bullets spraying
blood and flying fur

Holden Dink Persephone and Harvey scatter and bust
through the turnstiles

Buddy Ninja backflips onto a nearby building as GREEN FIRE
LANCES from Hellena’s staff obliterating a ticket booth
into rubble

Death CLAPS and CROAKING FROGS rain down from the sky He
looks sheepishly at his furry new limbs

DEATH
Crap these things still aren’t
broken in

The Night Mayor turns his assault on Hellena who throws up
a translucent magical shield that sends the bullets
ricocheting all over the place

HELLENA
You ungrateful lout I placed you
in a position of power to oversee
Spectre Leaf as your own And this
is how you repay my kindness

NIGHT MAYOR
What can I say I have a vacation
house at the beach and no means
for a tan

Hellena SCREAMS and hurls a volley of fire at him The
Night Mayor ducks and rolls again showering the area with
gunfire

EXT CARNIVORIUM STREET — NIGHT

Holden and crew dash down an empty street and take a hard
left into a huge stadium

INT MIDWAY OF MACABRE — NIGHT

The group rushes into a yawning misted arena from a dark
corridor coming to a halt in the middle of the stadium
while staring up at the rows and rows of empty seats

HOLDEN
Why the hell did we run in here
for
DINK
You were in the lead you
chickenshit yellow crayon

PERSEPHONE
Quiet there’s somebody here

A STONE DOOR SLAMS shut behind them sealing off the
corridor into the arena

A single SPOTLIGHT CLICKS on slicing through the misty air
to illuminate a hunched figure in the center of the ring

A horrific face rises into the light all jagged fangs
blackened scales and blood-red eyes GUILDERFANG the ghoul
licks his peeling lips with a long serpentine tongue

GUILDERFANG
Welcome Welcome to my parlor

HARVEY
Oh the Harvey knows this Said
the spider to the fly Said the
spider to the—

DINK
Fuck Harvey can it will ya

Guilderfang stands erect all ten-feet high of him black
dribble sliding down his chin

GUILDERFANG
Welcome Welcome to the deadliest
show on earth here under the
bigtop of Guilderfang courtesy of
the Midway of the Macabre as we
host the timeand fight of your
life

Unseen gears GRIND and a metal DOOR SQUEALS open at the far
end of the arena as black lights flicker on coating the
ring in a funky fluorescent glow

MURMURING and garbled CHATTER sound from all around

And then the CARNIES enter stage left

Several JUGGLERS ride in on unicycles twirling and
catching several flaming bowling pins

A juggernaut of a STRONGMAN bursting with bulging muscle
GRINDS a CINDERBLOCK between his hands

A BEARDED LADY dances into the midway a brace of throwing
knives strapped to her torso

GYMNASTS missing large portions of flesh somersault across
the ground and leap high into the air grabbing hold of
swinging trapezes

An obnoxious BEEP-BEEP sounds and a tiny yellow car ZOOMS
into the middle of the arena SCREECHING to a halt A door
opens and a CLOWN armed with a flaming pie steps out
Followed by another And another And another And so forth
until an army of clowns congests the entire area

Dink pulls out his shotguns He hands one to Holden

DINK
Time to rethink that whole ‘I
don’t kill things I don’t believe
in’ crock of shit eh

Holden cocks the weapon

HOLDEN
You bet your sweet ass it is

Persephone taps her wrist a few times and her hand
TRANSFORMS into a rather large contraption that looks like
a Gatlin gun crossed with a flamethrower and a tazer

HOLDEN
What about Harvey

Harvey chuckles grabs the zipper at the front of his bunny
suit and pulls it down stepping out of his costume

Underneath he is armed to the teeth with knives grenades
and 9mm Berettas

DINK
Oh you nuclear asshole And
you’re just now bringing this to
the table

HARVEY
The Harvey doesn’t believe in
violence Like you don’t believe
in erections

DINK
Touche

The crowd of CARNIES surrounds the foursome And Wyclef

DINK
Well hello all you pieces of
shit Time to meet the fan

KABLAM A SHOTGUN BLAST separates a juggler from his
unicycle in a mess of gore His innards and bowling pins
fly through the air and catch several carnies on FIRE

SCREAMS and SHOUTS rattle the midways foundation as the
Carnies attack

EXT SCARY-GO-ROUND — NIGHT

The Night Mayor squeezes MACHINE GUN FIRE over his shoulder
as he runs toward a five-story merry-go-round filled with
impaled MONSTROSITIES that MEWL and SNARL as they run
around in a circle

He leaps up and grabs the bottom rungs of a ladder yanking
himself above GNASHING werewolf FANGS that just barely miss
him

He scrambles up the ladder to the top of the building
As his hand reaches the top of the ride a black HEEL SLAMS
into it impaling it to the building He cringes in agony

his eyes slipping upward to the culprit

Hellena stands above him staff flaring before her her
teeth and eyes glinting in the moonlight

HELLENA
Going somewhere Mayor The night
is still so young

EXT ROOFTOP — NIGHT

Buddy Ninja removes his flip-flops and creeps across the
rooftop adjacent to where Hellena looms over the Night
Mayor He removes two shuriken from his bandolier

A CLAP of THUNDER booms forth and LIGHTNING SIZZLES the
tile mere feet from him searing a hole in the roof

Death steps into view all robes cowl and bear claws

DEATH
Damnit If this infernal alcohol
buzz would wear off you’d be
deader than Dante right now

ZING Buddy unsheathes his samurai sword

BUDDY NINJA
I fear not the stare of the great
abyss known as Death even from
Death himself

DEATH
Stare into the abyss long enough
and the abyss stares back at you
That means I can end your life
with a staring contest

SIKT SIKT The two shuriken bury themselves into Death’s
fiery red pupils rupturing something as PUS and ocular GOO

POPS out his skull

BUDDY NINJA
Not anymore

INT MIDWAY OF MACABRE — NIGHT
Sheer mayhem infests every inch of the stadium

Dink and Holden BLAST various attacking clowns with their
shotguns as they dodge EXPLODING PIES

Persephone’s weapon-hand sprays FLAMES into the horde
rendering mass portions to ash

Harvey hacks through the competition with spinning knives
like a lumberjack on crystal meth

Even Wyclef zooms about diving and clawing and blowing
fire in the faces of adversity

Then Guilderfang leaps to the center of the fray knocking
a row of pie-hurling clowns out of the way right in front
of Holden who loses his footing and goes down

The monstrous ghoul snatches up a stray clown and cleaves
the head off with a snap of his jaws He chews for a
moment

Then spits the clown’s head out It rolls to a top by
Holden’s feet

GUILDERFANG
That tasted funny

EXT SCARY-GO-ROUND — NIGHT

Hellena grinds her heel further into the Night Mayor’s
hand He YELPS in response

HELLENA
I gave you everything you
ungracious waste of oxygen And I
don’t take kindly to slaps in the
face metaphoric or otherwise

The Night Mayor slowly slides his machine gun up toward the
Wench Everlasting

NIGHT MAYOR
Well perhaps you could explain
the error of my ways to me so that
I may repent and make it up to
you

HELLENA
Simple I spare you the long-
winded diatribe while you attempt
(MORE )

HELLENA (0S)
to shoot me with your firearm and
instead sodomize you to death with
it

With a wave of her hand the machine gun RIPS from the
Mayor his hand and arm still attached to it It drops out
of sight

WUNK Blood pours from the Night Mayor’s mouth Followed by
the barrel of a machine gun

He tumbles from the ledge to the ground below with a SPLAT
No sooner than he does a bear arm lands at Hellena’s feet
Followed by another Then a rotted skull with two throwing
stars buried in it Finally a bloody robe floats down and
curls up on the roof
Hellena furtively glances around
Nobody is there
A BURST of green FIRE and she disappears
INT MIDWAY OF MACABRE — NIGHT
Guilderfang towers over Holden drool cascading like a
waterfall over his chin a clawed hand reaching out to
gather him

HOLDEN

(squeaks )
Help

KABLAM A SHOWER of black BLOOD and some choice other gunk
splatters Holden from head to toe as a look of confusion

passes over his mangled features

Guilderfang bends over and examines the sizable hole where
his stomach and intestines used to be

And sees Dink at the other end of it cigar in mouth and
shotgun in hand

DINK
Ain’t indigestion a mother fucker

Guilderfang falls forward directly onto Holden but
instead of squishing him Holden stands right through the
gaping hole in his torso coming out the other end covered
in even more slime and grossness

Holden blinks And exhales

HOLDEN
Thanks I think

DINK
You’re welcome

HOLDEN
And that’s it

DINK
You’re welcome you ass-lipped
pussy fart

HOLDEN
Now that’s more like it

A monstrous BOOM of THUNDER shakes the midway followed by
an EXPLOSION of emerald ENERGY that RIPS the entire ROOF
from the building

Hellena hovers over the commotion robes billowing in the
gusting wind

Carnies scatter and Holden fires his shotgun into their
midst as he rushes to join Dink Harvey and Persephone by a
blocked-off tunnel entrance

HOLDEN
Wow That is one pissed off
looking witch

PERSEPHONE 815
I suggest vacating the premises

DINK
Novel idea stovetop Except for
you know the how the fuck are we
gonna do that part
BUDDY NINJA (0OS)
Cast your gaze skyward meat

Everybody looks up to see Buddy standing atop the tunnel
samurai sword drawn He points up to a length of rope
leading to the ceiling

BUDDY NINJA
I shall release the anchor-line
and open the tunnel door

A freaky ACROBAT whizzes by on a trapeze

HARVEY
The Harvey wants to know why
you’re still helping us

BUDDY NINJA
Simple

Buddy sizes up the acrobat entering his downswing and
smiles as Hellena aims bursts of fire at him

BUDDY NINJA
The voices in my head dictated I
do so

And with a wink he leaps from the tunnel cleaves the
swinging acrobat in two and rides the trapeze to the
ceiling severing the length of rope

STONE RUMBLES and the tunnel door grinds open immediately

followed by a deafening WHOOSHING Carnies Holden and

everybody else are sucked from their feet and sent hurtling

into the exit corridor as if stuck in a wind tunnel
INT TUNNEL — NIGHT

Holden and crew hurtle down the corridor like skydivers

sucked into a giant vacuum cleaner They HOLLER and YELL as

their hair flies wildly and their faces squish back

HOLDEN
Damnit

PERSEPHONE 815
What is it

HOLDEN
I pissed my pants Again I also
may have crapped a little

INT BASEMENT OF MIRRORS — NIGHT

Mirrors of all makes of shapes and sizes cram a warehouse-
sized room

Holden and crew spin into the room and slam to the floor
with collective THUNKS followed by two fanged clowns and a
bearded lady

Dink jumps to his feet and pumps a SHOTGUN BLAST into the
nearest clown Harvey does some break dance move into a leg
choke and SNAPS the other clown’s NECK

The bearded lady holds up her hands

BEARDED LADY
You wouldn’t hurt a lady now
would you

RIIIIIP Persephone tears the beard from the lady’s face
along with the lower part of her jaw She sloughs to the
floor quite dead

HOLDEN
Wow Remind me to never piss any
of you off

Dink pulls a steel jar of fullmoonshine from his coat and
takes a swig

DINK
I’ve been pissed off at you since

I met you commander cockblock

THUNK THUNK THUNK THUNK THUNK A dozen more Carnies
land in the room all armed all looking mighty ticked off

GUNFIRE ERUPTS and mayhem ensues

Holden backs up eyes darting over the Carnies and the
distorted reflections in the mirrors

They stop on a small mirror at the far side of the room

The one showing his mother face buried in her hands
apparently crying

HOLDEN
Mom

He runs over to the mirror his face a mask of concern

HOLDEN
Mom are you all right Please
don’t cry I’m sorry I’m not home
Ill be there soon I swear

He places his hand on the mirror his fingers tracing over
two keyholes

He furrows his brow and retrieves the two golden keys from
his person He slides them into the keyholes and gives them
a turn

Suddenly he falls forward and through the mirror as if
it’s not even there

EXT HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL — DAY

Holden tumbles through a waterfall onto a stretch of a
crisp green meadow filled with colorful flowers and winces
under the sudden brightness of a midday sun hand shielding
his eyes

MORTIMER (0S)
Top o’ the morning sonny

Holden jumps at the voice and turns to see Mortimer Gale
from Flight 815 seated beside a bubbling spring in an
industrial-sized wheelchair complete with a rollbar and
monster truck tires

HOLDEN
What thehey I know you You
sat next to me on the plane

MORTIMER
I can see your mother didn’t raise
a dummy
HOLDEN
Where am I Where are my friends

MORTIMER
Welcome to Hope Springs Eternal
Your friends will be along
shortly I’m sure

Mortimer pushes a joystick on the armrest and his
wheelchair rumbles forward

HOLDEN
Are you the Caretaker

MORTIMER
Caretaker of what

HOLDEN
Um Pandora’s Hope Chest

Mortimer cackles

MORTIMER
Let me guess Dodger told you that
right after he skipped out on a
bar tab

HOLDEN
Dodger said you could help me er
us Hey how come the sun is out
here and nowhere else

MORTIMER
Because you’re in Hope Springs
Eternal also known as the inside
of Pandora’s Hope Chest It’s
quite the lovely metaphor don’t
you think

Before Holden can respond the sky darkens blotting out

the sun and flowers wilt as shadows stretch over
everything

MORTIMER
You might want to get behind me
sonny She’s coming

Mortimer flicks a switch on his wheelchair and it
transforms into a huge robotic exoskeleton complete with
machine guns rocket launchers and the like

Holden slides behind Mortimer as the WATERFALL SHATTERS
apart as if made of glass Dink Persephone and Harvey
hurtle across the meadow all of them unconscious and
their hands and feet bound by shackles of green energy

Hellena strides across the wilted flowers after them staff
crackling with magic

HELLENA
Hello Mortimer you decrepit old
prune I want that last key and I
want it now before I destroy each
and everybody within my sight
starting with the boy cowering
behind you

MORTIMER
Ah Hellena you lock me away for
all these years and now you want
me to help you Your sense of
entitlement never ceases to
befuddle

Mortimer unleashes a frenzied VOLLEY of machine GUN FIRE

Hellena counters with a BLAST of MAGIC and the two engage
in battle as Holden slips away to his friends ducking
under spraying magic and bullets

He bends over Harvey and removes one of his many knives
from a sheath He takes a hack at the magic shackles and
blasts a good twenty feet backward through the air for his
efforts

HOLDEN
Oooocooow

Suddenly Buddy Ninja drops silently in front of him

BUDDY NINJA
You must destroy the Wench
Everlasting to release your
(MORE )

BUDDY NINJA (CONT’D)
friends and be free of Spectre
Leaf

Holden staggers to his feet

HOLDEN
I kinda thought killing was your
brand of waffle

BUDDY NINJA
Indeed I know no other happiness
But I need your help

HOLDEN
Let’s hear it

LATER

Hellena smacks Mortimer with a nasty barrage of fire
sending the robotic exoskeleton and old man tumbling across
the meadow

HELLENA
You should surrender the key
Mortimer Gale I take no pleasure
smiting the crap out of a dried-
up dusty old man Well maybe I
take a little pleasure

MORTIMER
Kiss my wrinkled ass

Hellena deflects a blast of gunfire

HOLDEN (0S)
Excuse me

Hellena turns to see Holden holding a mason jar of
fullmoonshine cribbed from Dink

HOLDEN
But I have delivery for the
world’s biggest bitch

He hurls the mason jar above Hellena’s head Just when it
looks like it’s an overthrow two shuriken from Buddy
SHATTER the JAR dumping its contents all over Hellena’s
face burning it with a harsh SIZZLE on contact

Hellena SCREAMS hands brushing at the potent concoction

She glares at Holden her face badly scarred and gross
looking Magic gathers around her staff

HELLENA
You’re going to pay for that you
sniveling pain in the nether-area

HOLDEN
Yeah but I’m not the one who
looks they just got hit with a hot
bag of nickels

Hellena screeches and flings fire at Holden who rolls just
as Buddy lands behind her

SIKT The Wench’s eyes grow large as she looks down to see
the business end of a samurai sword protruding from her
gut

She whirls and snatches Buddy up by the throat magic
coursing from her hands into him

But only for an instant as a BURST of FIRE from Mortimer’s
flamethrower on his exoskeleton ignites the fullmoonshine
all over Hellena’s person

She and Buddy EXPLODE in a maelstrom of FLAME and MAGIC

Body parts tattered clothing and mechanical parts rain
from the sky onto a grimacing Holden

Mortimer walks over on his robotic legs

MORTIMER
Good job sonny I haven’t seen a
firework display like that since
the war

HOLDEN
Butbut you just blew up Buddy
MORTIMER
Oh relax He was an android
created by the Night Mayor His
vitals are saved on a hard drive
and can be downloaded into another
vessel neato mosquito

Dink Harvey and Persephone join Holden

PERSEPHONE 815
Judging by the mass amount of body
parts and a quick DNA scan I
assume the Nocturnal Wench
Everlasting has been vanquished

HOLDEN
Yeah Something like that

DINK
You just got rid of the biggest
piece of broken glass toilet paper
in Spectre Leaf and you look like
somebody just cornholed your
iguana What’s the matter

MORTIMER
Holden now has an important
decision to make

Mortimer presses a few buttons on his wheelchair A door
appears out of thin air The last golden key hangs
suspended beside it

MORTIMER
Pandora’s Hope Chest rewards those
who selflessly gives to those who
need them to those who hope
Behind that door is what you hope
for most

HOLDEN
What if what I hope isn’t what
everybody else hopes

MORTIMER
Then so be it The Chest will look
deep into your heart and follow
its true desire Simple as that

Holden turns to his companions

But they’re gone As is Mortimer Holden stands alone in
the moonlight in front of the door

MORTIMER (VO)
Now is not the time for goodbyes
sonny Now is the time for
greetings so greet your choice
with open arms

Holden nods and plucks the key from the air He takes a
deep breath and inserts it into the lock turning it

He steps through the door into blackness
INT FLIGHT 815 — BATHROOM — DAY
Darkness

STEWARDESS (VO)
Sir Sir are you okay

RASPY VOICE (VO)
Wake up dingleberry

ENGLISH ACCENT (VO)
I believe the lad’s cracked his
bloody noggin on the sink

Holden’s eyes snap open and look directly into the pretty
face of the stewardess who looks a lot like Persephone

They dart to the raspy-voiced dwarf who looks a lot like
Dink Then to the English accented fellow who favors the
Artful Draft Dodger

HOLDEN
What the What happened Are we
alive

STEWARDESS
Quite alive sir Let us help you

up
The English guy and stewardess lift Holden to his feet

ENGLISH ACCENT
How’s the head mate

HOLDEN
Isis the sun out

INT FLIGHT 815 — HOLDEN’S SEAT - DAY

Holden sits in his seat looking around the fuselage at all

of the faces that look like who he met in Spectre Leaf

Dink Persephone Dodger Elemeno Pee Harvey wearing pink

bunny ears who Holden now sees is amusing a small child

Strangely the woman that had her chair jostled is no
longer in her seat

A finger taps him on the shoulder
Holden turns to see Mortimer

MORTIMER
You made the right choice sonny

HOLDEN
Huh What

Mortimer gestures out the window

MORTIMER
Just look

Holden looks through the window
WINDOW

Sunlight shines over a clear blue sky

Directly on a lone building that could be the Orphanage

rushing river A town that could be Tavernacle A huge
lake What looks to be a carnival

Holden looks at Mortimer eyes wide

MORTIMER
Your mother will be happy to see
you And Spectre Leaf owes you a
great debt

HOLDEN
Are youare you really him Did
all of that that I think happened
really happen

Mortimer smiles

MORTIMER
I just hope the plane doesn’t
crash again

A JOLT of TURBULENCE rattles the plane A grinning Dink
leans over the seats his face smack in Holden’s

DINK
At least not until you get a fresh
change of pants you piss-stained
assmonkey

Persephone and Harvey both turn and wink at Holden
FADE OUT

DINK (VO)
Oh and lemme tell you Hold and
Fuck her thanks to you and the
Hope Chest I got a hard-on that
could harpoon a wildebeest So
tell your ma I said ‘hello’ And
oh never ‘spect to leave

HEE
