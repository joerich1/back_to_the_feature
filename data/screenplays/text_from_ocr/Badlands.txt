A strange animal not a deer or a horse but like them moves
languidly through the thick of the forest Holly puts down
her binoculars amazed

of the doves and the hum of
dragonflies in the air made it always
seem lonesome and like everybodys
dead and gone

Kit sits in the crows nest at the top of the treehouse
browsing through a copy of National Geographic amused by
what he sees looking around to find somebody he can share
it with

was like the spirits were whispering
about all the little things that
bothered em

TIGHT ON SLIDES

With each of her thoughts a slide appears a canal in Brazil

a camel boy in front of the Great Pyramid some cows standing
in a fjord with a steamship in the distance a mother with

her child a woman playing the piano as another woman looks
on a family on a lawn a soldier in a wheatfield whispering
something into his girlfriends ear

EXT RVER

Kit is fishing with his crude net He stops briefly to watch
a truck passing down the highway In the distance then goes
back to work

This stretch of river seems dangerously close to civilization

HOLLY (VO)
For days afterward lived in dread
At times wished could fall asleep
and be taken off to some magical
land but this never happened

Kit frustrated draws his pistol from his back pocket and

looks around for the fish that has been eluding him He does
not see as we do a MAN watching him from across the river
He fires at the fish misses it and fires again The Man

DISSOLVE TO
SERIES OF ANGLES TREEHOUSE

Holly is off somewhere in the forest putting on lipstick

Kit sits on watch in the crows nest a pair of binoculars

close at hand On sound over the music we hear voices
whispering to them Kit sees a movement in the brush A moment
later a figure appears a hunter carrying a gun Kit shouts

a code word to Holly She takes off running as Kit clambers
down the planks of the treehouse and collects his shotgun

He tells her to hide runs through the woods and dives ina

hole under a cover of leaves She jumps behind a log

Several shots of the still forest follow then the hunters
appear a shoulder here pant leg there The music ends as
one of them cocks his gun They pass right over the hole
where Kit is hiding Kit rises up slowly gives them a
gentlemanly word of warning then shoots all three in the
back He checks to see if anybody else is with them then
calls weakly out to Holly

see if theyve left anything behind then jumps down He

flips over the wicker hemisphere that covers their rooster
The rooster walks off free He surveys the woods then looks
back at Holly who returns his look and gets in the car

HOLLY (VO)
Kit felt bad about shooting those
men in the backs but he said theyd
come in like that and they wouldve
played it as down and dirty as they
could and besides hed overheard
them whispering about how they were
only interested in the reward money
With lawmen it wouldve been
different They were out there to
get a job done and they deserved a
fair chance But not a bounty hunter

a streamliner roars overhead When it has passed Holly
rushes up the grade to watch it disappear into the distance
Kit watches from the opposite end of the trestle

and looks through it then turns to find the Attendant staring

at him As he gets to his feet he nods at the trash can

book in the car and roars out of the station The police car
goes into a bootleggers turn and takes off after him

Kit heads down the highway After a while he turns off onto

a dirt road The police keep up with him He flips on the

radio and fires back at them The dust is so heavy that they
have a hard time just keeping track of him He checks his

own appearance and general demeanor in the rear view mirror
then swerves off the road onto the prairie The police manage
to keep up Together they roar through a herd of cows and
barb wire fence The police car slams into Kit trying to

slow him down Kit slams back into the police car They return
to the road Kit makes a ninety-degree turn but the police

car loses traction and rolls onto its side then back onto

four wheels again stalled Kit sees that he has lost them

He checks himself out in the mirror again puts on the rich
mans hat and skids to a stop The police car gets back
underway During these last few moments Holly is heard on

up on the hood We see how far behind the police are He
checks his pulse and jumps back down He scurries around
collecting rocks from the shoulder as the police approach
from the distance He makes a stack of the rocks to mark the
site of his capture for posterity finishing just as the

police car skids to a stop Kit throws up his hands and walks
forward to meet them Their guns are drawn
