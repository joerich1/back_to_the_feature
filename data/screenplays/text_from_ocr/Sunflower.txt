fills the screen

JOHN (VO)
Picasso said “Every act of
creation is first an act of
destruction”

FADE IN

INT COLLEGE CLASSROOM - DAY

The blinds are shut The projector light baths JOHN HENRY in
an unnatural glow He’s 43 Very put together Amiable

JOHN
He was speaking of the duality of
art

A SUITED MAN watches from the back doorway His eyes intense
Not at all interested in the lecture

JOHN
-how artist must mold the chaos
to give way to order Picasso
understood you couldn’t have one
without the other

He shuts off the projector The remaining light slices
through the blinds He moves between the desks of STUDENTS

JOHN
The final question I’1l pose before
you all run off into the summer sun
and forget everything I’ve taught
you this semester is if God
created the world from chaos in
Genesis does that make every
artist God

STUDENT
Only if they complete their
masterpiece in six days

John laughs with his students as the bell RINGS He turns
back for the front as the students disperse The suited man
flips on the lights Makes his way to John

SUITED MAN
Excuse me Professor Do you have a
moment

He pulls a PICTURE from his suit jacket pocket
SUPERTITLE DAY 172

INT JOHN’S HOME - EVE’S BEDROOM - DAY

A SKINNY WOMAN sits on the window ledge a copy of “ROBINSON
CRUSOE” open in her lap She uses a dull pencil to make a
single mark in the book

This is EVE 24 Her face is gaunt a little too skinny
which highlights the severeness of her beauty She wears a
blank expression Her eyes out the barred window

Three storeys below a field of GIANT YELLOW SUNFLOWERS
stretches toward the horizon It’s too bright Too sunny
Nothing like the girl sitting in the window

EXT BACK ROAD

A barbwire fence next to a 15 foot irrigation DITCH lines
one side of this empty road A CHEVY TRUCK flies down it
CLASSICAL MUSIC comes from

INSIDE

John whistles along in perfect pitch Taps the wheel keeping
time The empty fields roll past out the windows

INT JOHN’S HOME - EVE’S BEDROOM

Eve’s still at the window still staring out She turns her
head slightly anticipating the SOFT CLICK by the door
EXT BACK ROAD

John’s Chevy drives through the gate of the SUNFLOWER FARM

EXT BARN

JP -- 28 Skinny trailer trash -- huffs as he lifts a bag of
fertilizer carries it over and drops it next to the stacked
piles in front of the MASSIVE WOODEN BARN

RICK (0S)
Come on you gotta do it like I
told you Stacks of four lined up

Rick -- 40 A fat trucker -- wipes his brow with a towel
JP
What’s it matter

RICK
That’s how he wants it so that’s
how we do it

Rick picks up a bag Plops it down on a pile

JP
What kind of asshole cares about
how you stack shit

RICK
(correcting )
Fertilizer

JP gives him a whatever shrug Plops down on one of the
stacks Eyes the

THREE STORY VICTORIAN-ERA FARM HOUSE

20 feet away It’s freshly painted Pristine If you could
see into the rain gutters they’d be spotless A 30 foot
clearing leads from the house the sunflower fields 3 dogs
BARK in the fenced in kennel on the other side

John’s Chevy roars around from the front of the house Pulls
to a stop in front of JP cutting off his view of the house

RICK
Hey John

JOHN
Rick

John eyes JP as he climbs from the truck
RICK
This here’s JP He’s working with

me now

John nods Inspects their set up of the fertilizer

INT BARN

John slides open the massive doors Rick and JP carry three
sacks in JP’s eyes widen as his eyes fall on all the
EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT sitting around

A 15 drawer toolbox sits in one corner A car covered by a
tarp in another A crop dusting tractor on monster truck
wheels is parked next to it Rick WHISTLES in appreciation
RICK
When’d you get that

JOHN
A couple of weeks ago Helps when
you’re working all by yourself

JP turns in a circle looking like a kid in a candy store
His brow already scrunched up in scheming lines

RICK
How fast that thing go

JOHN
55 miles an hour

Rick WHISTLES again

INT JOHN HENRY’S HOME - KITCHEN

Eve chops something at the counter Her back to us She
finishes Dumps the cut veggies into a pot on the stove She
grabs a dish towel and wipes her hands turning to the window
over the sink

John emerges from the barn with Rick and JP in tow A slight
smile finds its way to Eve’s lips Loveor maybe a
mischievous inside joke Hard to tell

EXT BARN
John closes the driver side door to Rick’s van Smiles
JOHN

I’1ll have that check for you next

week
Rick nods starts his van up JP eyes the house again
There’s just something about it
INT KITCHEN
Eve stares into the refrigerator Pulls out a plastic bowl of
saran-wrapped salad The door slides closed as she goes to
the trash can in the corner
She stares into the garbage bag Considers Is she really

going to do this She glances behind her at the corner
ceiling like someone’s perched up there watching
After another thought beat she turns back to the trash
Dumps the salad in Bowl and all

EXT BACK PORCH

The screen door slams behind John as he crosses the closed in
back porch He unclips the MASSIVE KEY ring clipped to his
belt Shuffles through it There’s four locks on the back
door but he quickly finds the keys that belong to them

INT BACK HALLWAY

John reaches a security key pad by the door at the end of the
thin hallway He punches in a code Goes into the

DINING ROOM

where Eve is setting the table with plastic utensils She
glances up Smiles He smiles back Walks over to the cabinet
in the corner Uses his key ring to unlock it Turns on a
little CLASSICAL DINNER MUSIC

Eve’s setting out the utensils perfectly She adjusts the
bowl of dinner rolls slightly so it’s in line with the
sunflowers in the glass vase in front of it John comes up
behind her kisses her on the cheek

JOHN
How is my Sunflower

EVE
Good

He adjusts the rolls just another inch Now it’s perfect He
notices her PINK TOENAILS in her flip flops

JOHN
I like that color on you

EVE
I’m glad you picked it out for me
It’s perfect

He sits at the head of the table She opens the casserole
dish in front of her A perfectly cooked ROAST John’s face
drops slightly She clocks the reaction Pleased

JOHN
Roast is for Sundays

Eve sits and unfolds her napkin in her lap
EVE
I thought we could break the
routine this week

A tense beat Obviously Eve thought wrongbut John smiles
through the annoyance Scoots his chair back

JOHN
Excuse me

He goes to the door Pushes the security code in Eve strains
to see where his finger lands He disappears behind the door

UNDER THE TABLE Eve’s pink polished feet slip out of her
flip flops and into the sneakers next to them

The door lock CLICKS John enters with a MEDIUM SIZED KNIFE

JOHN
Did you do any reading today

He cuts into the roast slicing with exact precision

EVE
Almost finished Robinson Crusoe

JOHN
One of my favorites

Another pleasant smile from Eve John’s eyes drift over the
table A pitcher of lemonade Mashed potatoes Rolls --

JOHN
There’s a salad with this meal

EVE
Oh Sorry I must have missed it

She gives him an apologetic smile and goes into the
KITCHEN

where her smile drops She crosses to the stove quickly
Grabs the pot It’s filled with water and the chopped
veggies COMPLETELY UNCOOKED

She dumps them in the sink Glances into the dining room on
her way to the refrigerator John’s still slicing Good

She opens the refrigerator and bends to lace up her sneakers
We get a full view of the inside now -- it’s nothing but
PLASTIC CONTAINERS They’re all labeled with date cooked and
date for consumption
Eve pulls her laces tight -- takes a deep breath building up
her courage and --

EVE
(calling out)
I don’t see the salad
IN THE DINING ROOM John slices into the roast Hard

JOHN
Are you sure

EVE (0S)
Maybe you forgot it

His face clouds He stabs the knife into the roast and goes
into the

KITCHEN
Eve’s ass hangs out the refrigerator door

JOHN
Let me see

He pulls the door back and --
BAM

She UPPER CUTS HIM WITH THE POT He stumbles back Stunned
She SLAMS him in the face two more times He topples back
into the trash can the salad spilling across the floor

JOHN
Don’t

She slams him across the face again He falls over to the
side Spits out blood She goes for the key ring clipped to
his pants He flips LIGHTNING FAST -- YANKS her arm and --
SNAP 20 or so keys FLY EVERYWHERE

EVE
Shit
She brings the pan around -- it’s a weak swing -- he grabs
her arm -- brings his foot up and -- SMASHES her in the

stomach with his steel-toed work boot

She reels back into the refrigerator He springs to his feet
Advances with fire in his eyes She lashes her foot out --
CONNECTS WITH HIS CROTCH His hands go to it on instinct She
brings her leg up again -- kicks him square in the chest
He drops She gets to her feet and with two hands on the
handle brings the pan down Not once but twice He’s down
for the count She scrambles to pick up keys

JOHN HENRY
Eve

He reaches out for her fighting to get to his feet She
grabs up as many keys as she dares to and runs into the

DINING ROOM
slamming the kitchen door behind her She takes a beat What
the fuck is she doing again Her eyes lock on the knife She

drops the pan and pulls it from the roast

JOHN (0S)
Eve

She moves for the other door Pushes in the code It’s wrong

JOHN (0S)
EVE

She tries to concentrate Gets the code wrong again

EVE
Shit
She smashes the buttons in CLICK John CRASHES through the
kitchen door as she RIPS the keypad from the wall -- throws
open the door and -- slips through as he lunges --

BACK HALLWAY

John SLAMS against the other side She runs for the back
door Jams the first key in

IN THE DINING ROOM John RAPS on the door Tries the code in
the broken key pad No luck He smashes it with his fist
Rips it the rest of the way off the wall

AT THE BACK DOOR Eve has two locks unlocked She’s getting
down to her last few keys What if she didn’t pick up the
right ones

BACK IN THE DINING ROOM one last bang on the door then John
stops Takes a deep breath No need to get the blood pressure
up He stalks over to the cabinet in the corner

He feels around the top Smiles when his hand lands on a
SYRINGE filled with yellow liquid

AT THE BACK DOOR Eve’s got three locks opened She has two
keys left She tries one Doesn’t work

EVE
Pleaseplease

She sticks the last one in Hesitates Turnsclick

EXT JOHN HENRY’S HOME - NIGHT

Eve tares across the back porch through the screen door and
down the stairs The FLOODLIGHTS on the house click on
illuminating Eve running for her life and --

JOHN BARRELING AROUND THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE like the maniac
we’ll soon come to know him as Eve doesn’t even see him
It’s not until he’s right behind her that she senses him
turns slightly and --

BAM

He LINEBACKER TACKLES her to the dirt Rolls on top For a
second she just lies splayed out John catches his breath

JOHN
I can’tlet you go Eve

She struggles now KICKING SLAPPING BITING

EVE
FUCK YOU

John holds her down Occasionally gets a hit in They roll
over Eve gets her arm out and -- with a ROAR -- she stabs
him with the KNIFE

He freezes Surprised to find a blade in his side She crawls
from under him Steps back

EVE
Fuck You

A LAUGH escapes his throat It’s the amused laugh of a child
enjoying his favorite game

JOHN HENRY
I win

She gives him a wild stare What the -- He lifts his other
hand to show her the EMPTY SYRINGE Oh fuck She backs away
shaking her head in complete disbelief

JOHN HENRY
You know I hate myself when you
make me do this

EXT SUNFLOWER FIELD
Eve thrashes through the flowers as tall as her

EVE
SOMEBODY HELP SOMEBODY HELP ME

She knows it’s pointless She knows she’s doomed The syringe
was empty but she can’t give up She can’tnot even as she
slows to a jogthen a walkthen a stagger

Her arms dangle listlessly at her sides She stops Sways
back and forth Turns back to the house and -- DROPS She
lays face first on the ground Paralyzed

John staggers through her destroyed sunflower path clutching
his bleeding stomach He falls to his knees next to her With
some effort he turns her over Her body just flops around

JOHN
I understand why you have to do
this I do

He caresses her cheek staring at her with the eyes of
someone deeply in love Her eyes flicker back and forth the
only thing on her body she can still move

JOHN
--and I hope you understand why I
have to do this

He SLUGS her Her head rocks to the side then back He
winces at the pain that movement caused him the anger
bubbling back to the surface He slugs her AGAIN
JOHN HENRY
You can’t feel any of this now
Eve But it’s going to hurt later

The sunflowers dance in the night breeze as he walks away

EXT 24 HOUR DINER - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

GRACE smokes against the wall in her waitress uniform We
only see her profile but she’s pretty Innocent pretty

She takes a deep drag Really blows the smoke back out her
nose like it could take all her problems with it

The back door slams open She quickly snubs out her
cigarette Turns It’s just BETH her overweight coworker

GRACE
Jesus Beth I thought you were
Ronnie

Beth pulls a pack of cigarettes

BETH
Sorry

She lights one Offers to Grace She waves it off

GRACE
I should get back in He catches me
taking another break

BETH
Yeah he wanted me to talk to you

GRACE
About what

BETH
Your face That asshole actually
told me to give you some make up
advice

Grace turns away Ashamed Now we see the BRUISING around her
eye and jaw She’s done a terrible job of covering it

GRACE
It looks worse than it really is

Beth sighs Shakes her head she’s heard all the excuses
BETH
You should probably stay at my
place tonight Let Bobby cool off

Grace gives Beth a half smile

EXT DINER PARKING LOT - STALKER’S POV

Were staring out the window of a truck parked in front of
the diner Wall to wall windows and florescent lighting
exposes everything inside like a diorama

Grace takes plates to a table Laughs at something one of the
customers says Turns back for the counter

MUSIC escapes the radio The stalker turns it down Starts to
whistle Something classical In perfect pitch as he watches
Grace count receipts at the register now

A CAR DOOR SLAMS across the parking lot The whistling peters
off as the suited man crosses the parking lot for the diner

INT DINER

Beth pulls her apron off as the suited man sits at the
counter He smiles over at Grace then turns to Beth

SUITED MAN
Can I get a coffee to go

BETH
Sorry honey but we’re off Wait
for Meg to come over

He watches Beth walk off with an incredulous look

GRACE
I’ll get it for you

SUITED MAN
Thanks I appreciate that

She sets about pouring his coffee He tries not to eye her
bruised face

GRACE
There you go

They lock eyes The sympathy floods out of his For a moment
Grace is caught in it

BETH (0S)
Grace will you hurry up

Beth waits one foot already out the door

EXT DINER
Beth notices a TRAILER TRASH TRUCKER strutting towards them

BETH
Shit Bobby

Grace glances up Oh shit is right Bobby smiles He looks
like trouble Sexy trouble if we didn’t already know better

BOBBY
Hey baby I came to give you a ride
home

He looks to Beth Back to Grace Daring her to say different
She’s clamming up so

BETH
She’s staying with me tonight
honey We’re going to have us a
little sleepover

Behind them the suited man exits the diner with his coffee

BOBBY
Oh yeah You guys going stuff your
faces with ice cream while bitching
about your men Well hell you
don’t have a man Beth and it’s
probably cause you should be
staying away from the ice cream

He steps between them as she blinks back her hurt The suited
man watches the scene brewing from his car door

GRACE
Bobby I just thought you might
need some time to yourself --

BOBBY
I already apologized for earlier
baby You trying to punish me I
know you’re not trying to make me
mad on purpose are you

GRACE
NoBeth just thought --

Bobby grabs her arm Pulls her toward the car

BOBBY
Beth should mind her own damn
business

SUITED MAN (0S)
Is there a problem here

Bobby stops The suited man’s a few feet away His car door
left open behind him

BOBBY
Were fine man

SUITED MAN
(to Grace )
You okay

Bobby pushes Grace behind him Advances on the suited man

BOBBY
Why can’t anybody mind their own
fucking business

The suited man pushes back his jacket his hand instinctively
going to the GUN holstered at his side Grace jumps at the
sight of it She grabs Bobby’s arm holding him back

GRACE
Bobbycome on lets just go home
Take me home okay

EXT DINER PARKING LOT - STALKER’S POV

Grace and Bobby cross the parking lot For a second Grace
looks into this truck Locks eyes with us but it’s only the
fleeting look of embarrassment She climbs into Bobbys car
The stalker starts up his truck

EXT SUNFLOWER FIELD - NIGHT

Eve twitches slightly getting some feeling back It takes
all her effort to slide her arm from her stomach to her side
She closes her eyes Spent

When she opens them again John’s there She actually looks
relieved He takes her into his arms

INT JOHN’S BATHROOM

John sits shirtless on the closed toilet seat Eve’s on her

knees before him Bandages his stab wound She’s still caked
in dirt and blood Moves slow still getting used to having

feeling back

JOHN
I think she’s ready

Eve smooths the tape over John’s side

EVE
Did she tell you that

JOHN
She said it with her eyes

He lifts Eve’s chin bringing her eyes to his

JOHN
Just like you did Just like you
do Am I wrong

EVE
No

He holds her stare for a moment then leans down and kisses
her She lets him He pulls back only slightly

JOHN
Yet you keep trying to escape

She doesn’t respond to that He drops her chin Goes to
leave but pauses in the doorway

JOHN
This was the first time you’ve
tried to hurt me

She can hear the disappointment He leaves She gets up and
goes over to the plastic bathroom mirror Stares at her cut
up and bruised reflection It’s a sad sight

INT GRACE’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Grace stares at her own reflection and it’s an equally sad
sight Only difference is her bruises are fading

BOBBY (0S)
I can’t sleep with that light on
baby Come to bed

INT JOHN’S BEDROOM
Eve comes out of the bathroom cleaned up and ready for bed
John’s already tucked under the covers She climbs in

pointedly ignoring the cup of milk on her night stand

JOHN
We can always do it the hard way

She grudgingly picks up the cup Drinks She pulls it from
her lips but --

JOHN
All of it

She hesitates then brings it back to her lips John smiles
as the last of it disappears She puts the cup back on the
night stand He turns off the lamp Pulls her close

JOHN
You’1l feel better tomorrow

INT JOHN’S BEDROOM - DAY

Eve hits the floor HARD wrapped in a ball of covers Shes
ash white Sweating The room SPINS PULSATES Goes IN AND
OUT OF FOCUS

She clutches the night stand Tries to pull herself to her
feet KNOCKS the milk glass away --

EVE
Damnit

She stumbles into the BATHROOM and sticks her finger down her
throat A second later she HEAVES VIOLENTLY into the toilet

INT DINER

Grace wipes the counter down Beth rings up a ticket at the
register Grace stops Preoccupied with something heavy

GRACE
I’m leaving Bobby

Beth looks at Grace Is she serious

GRACE
I packed my bags They’re in the
car I think I’m going to go stay
with my sister It’1ll be tight with
the kids but it’1ll only be for a
little while

BETH
It’s about time

Grace nods They share a smile Beth gives her a reassuring
arm squeeze before moving off Grace turns to the suited man
settling in at the counter

GRACE
What can I get you

SUITED MAN
Just another coffee please

His eyes follow her as she fixes it

SUITED MAN
I wanted to apologize for butting
into your business last night --

Grace glances self-consciously at the other costumers He
leans forward trying to be private now

SUITED MAN
I have this annoying habit of
sticking my nose where it doesn’t
belong

He holds out a card She reluctantly takes it

GRACE
Patrick O’Leary Private Detective
What are you doing in nowhere
North Dakota

O’ LEARY
I’m actually trying to track down
this girl

He pulls the picture from his jacket pocket Hands it to her
IT’S A PICTURE OF EVE A happier full-bodied Eve

GRACE
Is she missing

O’ LEARY
Missing might be too strong of a
word for this case Her parents are
paying a small fortune for me to
track her down Probably just a
spoiled rich girl who forgets to
call while blowing the trust fund

Grace hands the photo back

GRACE
If she’s rich why is she anywhere
near here

O’ LEARY
Don’t know She enrolled in some
classes at the local college She’s
probably halfway to Europe by now

Grace nods politely Another customer over sharing She
writes out O’leary’s tab Puts it down in front of him He
touches her hand lightly

O’ LEARY
I’m sorry I know it’s not my
place but you shouldn’t let him
hit you

They lock eyes He’s so sincere

INT LIVING ROOM - EVENING

John reclines in his La-Z-Boy Watches VIDEO CAMERA FOOTAGE
of Eve in the kitchen She walks to the trash can Considers
for a moment Turns LOOKS RIGHT AT THE CAMERA then tosses

John smirks Amused His watch BEEPS He shuts off the TV

EJECT He takes the tape over to a cabinet Unlocks it
HUNDREDS of tapes all labeled are stacked neatly inside

INT JOHN’S BATHROOM
Eve has her head on the toilet seat Eyes closed John bends
down next to her Taps the syringe in his hand Eve opens her

eyes Weakly shakes her head

EVE
No more drugs

John ignores her Plunges the syringe into her arm

INT BARN

John pulls the tarp away revealing an old station wagon

EXT BACK OF DINER - NIGHT

There’s only one little 60 watt bulb bathing the back of the
diner in a yellow glow Grace pulls her keys as she comes out
the back door Heads for BOBBY’S CAR and gets in

She considers her bags in the backseat then pulls her cell
from her purse Dials It rings twice

BOBBY’S VOICE
Hey baby You on your way home

Is she She looks off Hesitates then
GRACE

(Goodbye )
I love you
BOBBY ’S VOICE
I love you too baby I know it’s

get better You know that right

Grace catches her own eyes in the rearview mirror
emotion bubbling up

GRACE
I know

BOBBY ’S VOICE
Good Now get your ass home I been
missing you all day
A smile escapes her
BOBBY ’S VOICE
Hey are you going to bring some
leftovers back

She glances back at her bags Conflicted

BOBBY’S VOICE

She sighs

GRACE
What do you want

EXT BACK OF DINER

Grace climbs from the car Turns -- JOHN IS THERE
Right in her face And all this happens FAST --

JOHN
Please I need your help My
sistermy sister’s in the car

He points Grace looks but he’s speaking too fast

GRACE

JOHN

GRACE
I’m sorry --

Fights the

Frantic

JOHN

Grace is already halfway across the back lot being herded by
John He’s not giving her a chance to think

GRACE
I can call --

She turns He spins her back toward the station wagon

JOHN
I just don’t want to leave her
alone Please You have to help us
It’s my sister

The light doesn’t reach this far out but Grace can vaguely
see the FIGURE in the backseat of the station wagon now

GRACE
Oh my god what happened

JOHN
I don’t know we were driving and
she -- she just got sick

He pops open the passenger side door

JOHN
I’m just going to go inside and

Grace leans around the seat eyes widening as she sees a
drugged out Eve slumped across the backseat

GRACE
Are you okay

BAM

John whacks Grace across the back of the head with a blunt
object She slumps into the front seat Out cold John whacks
her two more times just for good measure

He pulls back -- slides the rest of Grace’s body in -- and
slams the door Eve diverts her eyes not wanting to look at
Grace bleeding from the gash on the back of her head

Bobby’s car STARTS UP somewhere out in the lot Eve moves a
shaky hand toward the door handle It’s taking everything in
her to focus enough for this simple movement She wraps her
fingers around it Pulls It’s locked of course

She slides her hand up the door towards the lock but she’s
fading She fights it Tries to stay conscious but --

FADE OUT
STROBE LIGHT FLASHES as John WHISTLES

The station wagon pulls into the barn He carries Eve back
into the house Puts her in bed Kisses her good night

He carries Grace over one shoulder down the road between the
sunflower field He cuts into the field navigating two rows
He lays her gently out on the ground Kicks around until his
foot catches on a LATCH

He pulls the door open leading down into his UNDERGROUND WORK
LAB He carries Grace down the steps disappearing into the
darkness then -- he emerges back into the light for a split
second an eerie smile on his face and slams the doors shut

BLACKOUT
Out of the darkness a thin whisper

JOHN HENRY (VO)
If you’re good Ill let you come
into the house

Silence then --

A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM that kicks off a series of rapid fire
images An ADD’S FRENZIED DRUG INDUCED HAZE -- all the
terrible things that happen in John’s dirty chaotic little
work lab

Grace is face down on a stained mattress Naked Each limb
stretched out and chained to the posts of the brass bed
She’s gagged Tears streaming from her eyes

John presses PLAY on a old tape player RANDOM NOISE fills
the room It’s the opposite of the classical music he loves

John stands in front of a wooden cabinet filled with various
sharp instruments Needles Shears Hunting knives He
chooses a tiny needle

EXT SUNFLOWER FIELD - NIGHT

The sunflowers sway to the non-beat of the random noise
leaking up and out

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Eve bolts upright Her hands clutching her chest Her eyes
wildly scan the room Where is she -- What day is it --

She’s hyperventilating A PANIC ATTACK in full swing There’s
a CREAK in the hallway Another Someone’s coming

She slides down in bed Pulls the covers up The door lock
CLICKS She tries to control her breathing Tries to swallow
the panic

The door swings open John is backlit by the hallway light
His clothes are covered in dirt and blood Sweat glistens on
his forehead He breathes heavy and satisfied

He takes a step into the room the wooden floor boards
CREAKING under his weight Eve shuts her eyes -- please God
let him think she’s asleep

He still has one hand on the doorknob reconsideringthen --
he turns Closes the door behind him Eve opens her eyes Her
heartbeat has slowed to almost normal againalmost

SUPERTITLE DAY 178

INT BEDROOM - DAY

Eve comes from the bathroom wrapped in a towel She sees the
YELLOW FLOWER DRESS laid out on the bed

INT DINING ROOM

John sets food out looks up to see Eve in the doorway
wearing the yellow dress

EVE
I love it Thank you

He doesn’t react Sits That unnerves her slightly but she
brushes it off Sits across from him

EVE
Where did you get --

JOHN
It wasn’t for you

Eves fork stops halfway to her mouth

JOHN
I’ve decided to bring Grace into
the house You’1l need to help her
get cleaned up

Eve sits back Stunned

JOHN
-e-and tell her the rules

INT BATHROOM

Grace huddles in the bathtub Dirty Bruised Damaged She
rocks back and forth Mumbles to herself Lost Eve considers
her from the doorway Why did he bring her into the house

After a beat she goes over to the tub Grace just mumbles
and rocks Rocks and mumbles Eve turns on the faucet and
reaches for the soap

INT KITCHEN

Grace sits at the two seater table An untouched sandwich on
a plate in front of her Eve washes dishes at the sink

EVE
So we don’t actually do anything
Not really There’s a lot of
specific shit to remember he likes
his house in order but as long as
you do it right it’s not so bad

She turns Grace stares out the kitchen window Eve frowns

EVE
You can’t escape

Grace flinches slightly Like that’s the first thing she’s
registered in a long time

EVE
Trust me I’ve tried There’s
automatic locks on all the inner
doors The front door Bolted shut
It doesn’t even open I learned
that the first time I tried to
escape

Grace swallows hard

EVE
And there’s a lock you need a
security code for on the back door
courtesy of my last attempt
There’s bars on all the bullet
proof glass windows and cameras
everywhere

Eve’s getting off on intimidating Grace

EVE
John carries drugs and a set of
handcuffs on him at all times And
he won’t even hesitate to use
them

She trails off talking more to herself then Grace now

EVE
He’s smart He’s thought of
everything There’s no way out

She stares out the window with Grace Lost in the idea of
being free then her face hardens She reaches over and pulls
the curtains closed

EVE
Did you hear me There’s no way
out So stop daydreaming and pay
attention to what’s going to keep
you alive

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Dinner Grace stares at her full plate Eve TALKS to John as
she eats John’s eyes are on Grace He picks up the bowl of
dinner rolls

JOHN
Grace would you like a dinner
roll

Eve stops talking a little irritated with being interrupted
Grace doesn’t look up from her plate John waits

EVE
I’1l1 take one

John GRABS HER HAND IN MID-AIR stopping her fingers inches
from the rolls Grace’s eyes snap up full of fear

JOHN
I asked Grace

Eve bites the inside of her cheek as John SQUEEZES her wrist
She cuts her eyes at Grace Say SOMETHING Grace opens her
mouth Shuts it again then finally

GRACE
Nothank you

John releases Eve’s wrist Her arm drops to the table

JOHN
Would you like a roll Eve

She doesn’t move He sets one on her plate She’1ll have one
rather she wants to or not now

INT LIVING ROOM

Grace sits on the sofa Stares at the painting above the
mantle A FEW PIANO KEYS are played There’s a flash of life
in her eyes -- it’s a tune she recognizes The KEYS are
played again but slightly different

EVE (0S)
Like that

JOHN (0S)
No Listen

John and Eve share the piano bench on the other side of the
room Grace turns her head slightly Listens to the NOTES
played again perfectly

EVE
Isn’t that what I just played

John sighs Eve’s a terrible student He looks to Grace She
turns her eyes back to the painting

INT BEDROOM

Grace lies on the right side of the bed Eyes on the ceiling
The bathroom light clicks off Eve crawls into her side of

the bed She turns away from Grace then

EVE
It’s my fault

A beat Another If Grace heard her she makes no sign

INT BEDROOM - MORNING
BANG BANG BANG
Grace SLAMS HER PALM against the side window
GRACE

HELP ME PLEASE UP HERE LOOK UP

HERE WE NEED HELP
Eve bolts up in bed It takes her a moment to focus on Grace
beating the bulletproof glass with everything she’s got
YELLING at the top of her lungs Eve covers her ears

EVE
Stop Hey They can’t hear you

Grace screams LOUDER Hits the glass HARDER

EXT BARN

JP lifts a bag on top of a stack Leans back stretches
ANGLE ON the window to Eve and Grace’s room Not a peep It’s
tinted You’d have no idea there’s a kidnapped girl flipping
out behind it

INT BEDROOM

Grace YELLS and HITS the window between sobs now

EVE
Seriously

Eve throws the covers back Stalks over and -- GRABS Grace
by the arm Spins her to face her YELLS right in her face

EVE
Shut up They can’t hear you

Grace breaks down into deep sobs now Sinks to the floor
EVE
(a half apology )
The windows are soundproof
INT BEDROOM - LATER
Eve comes out of the bathroom wrapped in a towel walks over

to the dresser Grace watches her from the window ledge Her
eyes tear free now

GRACE
Last night

Eve startles a little at the sound of Grace’s voice

GRACE
-when you said it was your fault
What did you mean

A beat Eve had forgotten she said that or wishes Grace had

EVE
Every time I try to escape he
takes another girl

GRACE
How many

EVE
Since I’ve been here Three

Grace sucks in a deep breath Eve turns to her

EVE
But none them came into the house
You’re the first

Grace doesn’t know how to process that information -- what it
means to be the first Then another thought clouds her mind
something more disturbing

GRACE
If they don’t come in the house
where do they go

Eve gives her a look She already knows the answer to that

GRACE
How could he have taken five girls
and no one’s noticed

EVE
Nine Three since I’ve been here
but there’s been others

Eve crosses to the bookcase Pulls the copy of “Robinson
Crusoe” Tosses it to Grace

EVE
Look in the front

IN THE FRONT under the title are the scribbled names of
FIVE GIRLS with dash marks next to them The first girl’s
name has the second most marks the most being next to EVE

GRACE
Megan

Eve drops her towel Changes in front of Grace without even a
second thought

EVE
I guess she’s the first Or just
the first to start marking --

GRACE
Oh my God

Grace has turned the page Sees that Eve’s marks continue
almost HALFWAY DOWN IT

GRACE
is this really how long you’ve
been here

EVE
Almost six months

Eve sees the horrified expression on Grace’s face

EVE
Don’t worry I doubt you’ll be here
that long

Was that supposed to be comforting Eve glances at the wall
clock Moves toward the door Reaches out for the doorknob
just as the lock clicks open Grace just watches her leave

EVE (0S)
Let’s go There’s chores to do

INT LIVING ROOM

Eve vigorously wipes down the table with Windex Grace uses
the duster to dust the mantle She wiggles one of the picture
frames It’s screwed down All of them are

She reaches up to dust the painting Notices a spiral scar on
her arm She rubs it

GRACE
(to herself )
I can’t tell the difference

EVE
Between what

Grace turns Watches Eve rub the chairs down with Pine She
moves quickly An expert at this cleaning routine

GRACE
The scars he gave me and the ones
Bobby did

Eve continues to clean not interested in chatting

GRACE
Bobby’s my boyfriend Was my
boyfriend He hit me

EVE
I know

How could she know that

EVE
John told me

Oh Grace fidgets Suddenly embarrassed

GRACE
I was going to leave him the night
I was kidnapped But then I
couldn’t If I hadn’t gotten back
out of the car to get Bobby some
leftovers

EVE
Youd still be kidnapped John’s
been watching you for a while It
was only a matter of time

Grace sits at the table Considers that simple truth Eve
glances over at her Annoyed Why isn’t she cleaning

GRACE
Why me Why you We’re-- we seem so
different

Eve takes the duster from her hand Clearly she’1l have to do
the cleaning herself

EVE
Look if I’ve learned anything in
six months with a psycho it’s not
to try to understand him

JOHN (0S)
Understand who

John’s in the doorway Wipes his brow He’s dirty from
farming Grace’s eyes go to the floor She tightens up
Scared Eve doesn’t miss a beat
EVE
Chekov Everything he writes is
just a Russian mess
John smiles
JOHN
Youre always trying to get a rise
out of me

EVE
Always

Grace’s eyes flick to Eve How can she be flirting with him

INT DINER
Beth’s at the counter Bobby’s on the other side Pissed

BOBBY
Where is she

She moves down the counter with a plate of eggs He follows

BOBBY
Just tell me where the fuck she is

She sets the plate down Moves back the other way

BOBBY
I just wanna talk to her

BETH
Yeah Sure

She moves around the counter Bobby follows bumping into
things not used to navigating the tables like Beth

BOBBY
She stole my fucking car I just
want my car back

Beth scoffs Yeah right He leans in close now
BOBBY

If I have to find her myself it’s
gonna be worse for her

BETH
I can’t help you Bobby I really
don’t know where she is
With that she turns for her tables Bobby seethes

BOBBY
Cunt

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT
Dishes fill the sink Eve washes Grace dries

JOHN (0S)
Grace

She almost drops the dish in her hands
JOHN
-will you join me in the living
room please

She throws an unsure look at Eve She ignores her

JOHN
Grace

GRACE
Ye-- Yes

He holds the door open for her She knocks into the side
trying to stay as far from him as possible

Eve washes and dries now Moments later PIANO NOTES drift
under the closed door Eve stops Listens The same NOTES are
played again just as perfect as the first time Grace is a
better student than her

She smiles Then a terrible thought flashes through her mind
Grace is a better student than her

SUPERTITLE DAY 183

INT KITCHEN - DAY

A tupperware container hits the floor Spaghetti splashes
everywhere Eve’s hands slap against the tile as she falls to
her knees sucking in air

She brings her head down against the floor Tries to will the
room to stop spinning Grace bends down next to her

GRACE
What’s wrong

Eve tries to speak Can’t

GRACE
Should I get John

Eve shakes her head Grace’s eyes search the kitchen What
can she do She’s starting to panic too

GRACE
I don’t know what to do I’m-- I’m
just going to get John

Grace stands Eve grabs her arm Drags her back to the
ground No John

GRACE
Okayyou need to -- to breathe

Eve cuts her a look That’s obvious Grace gets up and moves
behind her She wraps her arms around Eve pressing her chest
into Eve’s back Eve fights her for a second --

GRACE
Hold still It’s a breathing thing
I learned

Grace exaggerates her breathing Two in one breath out

GRACE
It works Just focus on my
breathing

Eve gives in They breathe together in silence as they sync
up Another beat of normal breathing and Grace sits back

EVE
I have these panic attacks
sometimes I think it’s a side
effect of all the drugs

Grace nods Waits This is the moment for a ‘thank you’ from
Eve but instead

EVE
Where did you learn that

Grace’s face clouds

GRACE
A Lamaz class

That surprises Eve Grace notices the spilled spaghetti

GRACE
He’s going to kill us if he sees
this mess

They look at each other Grace face pales

EVE
Probably

She laughs out of the absurdity Grace smiles but her fear
keeps the laughter down

EXT BACK PORCH - EVENING

Eve sits sideways on the porch swing Tries to sew a button
on one of John’s shirts He sits next to her gently swinging
the swing snapping one of the handcuffs around then pushing
it through when it catches Eve pokes her finger

EVE
Ow

John stares out his forehead wrinkled by thought

JOHN
I shouldn’t have planted them

She can’t re-loop the thread and it’s frustrating

EVE
(half-listening )
Huh

JOHN
The new seeds I planted last week
Maybe they’re more hassle than
they’re worth

EVE
Maybebut what can you do about
it now

JOHN

Over saturate The seeds won’t be
able to take all the moisture

Eve’s eyes drift to John now She can hear the slight
maniacal glee in his voice A killer talking about killing

JOHN
Flowers wouldn’t be able to grow
They’d be dead in the ground

Are they really talking about flowers Eve looks through the
window behind them Where’s Grace She glances at the
handcuff spinning in his hands

EVE
That sounds like a lot of trouble
JOHN
It’s easywouldn’t be any trouble
at all
EVE
Then do it

She’s back to attempted threading says this casually

EVE
Or you could just let them grow
out see if it’s really too much to
handle You can always cut them
down later

John stops with the handcuffs considers that

EVE
I can’t sew this I tried but --

JOHN
Leave it I’ll take care of it

Eve sits back It worries her that he’s still considering
EVE
You know maybe Grace could do it
INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Grace brushes her teeth at the sink Eve soaks in a bubble
bath in the tub behind her

EVE
Do you know how to sew

GRACE
(mouth full of
toothpaste )
Yes Why

EVE
Just wondering

Water splashes over the sides as she reaches for the soap on
the tub rim It slips from her grip

EVE
Damn

It slides across the wet floor and into the wall by the sink

EVE
Grab that for me

Grace spits reaches for the soap She notices the water
stained wallpaper It’s curling back on itself at the sink
edge She pulls it back slightly

EVE
Grace

Grace lifts the wallpaper back more Underneath it there’s
what looks like a mouse hole The wood around it is molded
and soggy She presses against it It bends easily

EVE
Take your time really

GRACE
(whispering )
I think I found something There’s
a hole here

Grace pushes the wood harder It breaks away Eve stands
behind her dripping suds

GRACE
(whispering )
Look The wood it’s weakened here
The overflow from the tub must have
done it

Grace pulls back more of the wallpaper The water erosion
goes about a foot off the floor

GRACE
(still whispering )
See

EVE
Why are you whispering

GRACE
Cause of the cameras

Eve glances back at the camera in the corner above the door

EVE
They don’t have sound

Grace breaks away more of the wood Gets down on her stomach
and peeks her head into the

VENT SHAFT

Wires and air ducts run up and down this 3 foot space that
spans the entire LENGTH OF THE HOUSE

EVE (0S)
I saw him watching the tapes once --

GRACE
Oh my godit’s a way out

EVE (0S)
What

Grace pulls her head back out Eve has stepped out of the
tub Covers herself with a towel

GRACE
It’s a vent For the heat

Eve pulls Grace out of the way Sticks her head in

GRACE
Where do you think it leads

EVE
Down

Eve pulls her head out nowhere near as excited as Grace

GRACE
It could be a way out

EVE
Doubtful All you’re reading from
this is “way out” and you should
be focusing on the “could be” It’s
a vent shaft going down the middle
of the house It’s only going to
lead to more locked rooms

Grace’s face drops all the little hope she had gone

GRACE
So what do we do

EVE
Cover it back up and forget about
it
Eve throws open the door to JOHN There’s a flash of surprise
in Eve’s face but she hides it quickly Grace moves away
from the wall bumping into the tub John looks between the
two for a second Did he hear them
JOHN
(to Eve)
I thought you’d be ready for bed

EVE
I just have to put on my pajamas

She slides past him

JOHN
Goodnight Grace

GRACE
Goodnight

She says it to the wet floor

SUPERTITLE DAY 183

INT DINING ROOM

Chores Grace has become a well oiled machine just like Eve
They move around in a odd ballet of cleaning

GRACE
What were you like Before John
kidnapped you

EVE
Does it matter

They both hesitate That came off harsher than intended

EVE
The same A bitch

Grace smiles

GRACE
What else Tell me more

EVE
Bored Spoon fed life by my
parents

(MORE )

EVE (CONTD)
I just wanted to get so far away
from their little predictable world

GRACE
They were looking for you

EVE
Who

GRACE
Your parents

That stops Eve cold

EVE
My parents were here

GRACE
No But a detective was He was
showing your picture around He
thought you were gone by now
though In Europe or something

Eve considers that for a second Goes back to cleaning Grace
sighs she wanted more of a reaction than that

GRACE
I don’t think there’s anyone
looking for me Not even Bobby

EVE
How long were you guys together

GRACE
Three years

Eve’s asking questions more out of boredom than curiosity

EVE
Was he hitting you from the
beginning

GRACE
Yes
(then )
When I found out I was pregnant I
didn’t even tell him cause I was
going to leave

Eve continues to clean which makes it easier for Grace to
continue It’s like she’s just talking to herself

GRACE
Every day I kept saying to myself
tomorrow I’1l do it Tomorrow Then
one night I told my friend Beth I
was pregnant and she wanted to
take me out to celebrate I forgot
to call I was just so excited to
finally tell someone it just
slipped my mind

Eve’s stopped cleaning She watches the emotion bubble up in
Grace with mixed feelings A little bit of sympathy and a lot
of discomfort

GRACE
He was mad of course I tried to
protect my stomach I tried to tell
him but he just kept hitting me
Over and over again and

Grace chokes up

EVE
You had a miscarriage

It wasn’t a question Eve’s just finishing the part Grace
can’t bring herself to say

EVE
And you still didn’t leave him
after that

Grace quickly wipes at the tears on her cheeks

GRACE
You must think I’m pathetic Youd
never let something like that
happen to you

EVE
Excuse me What do you think this
is that’s going on here

GRACE
With Bobby I wasn’t kidnapped

EVE
Fine You’re right But you act
like there’s some magic potion
that’s going to make you stronger
There isn’t Take some
responsibility and decide to stop
playing the victim

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Grace plays the piano Eve reads John smokes his cigar
Grace FUMBLES A FEW NOTES She goes to start back up but --

JOHN
That was an amateur mistake Grace
You need to pay more attention to
the page

Eve glances at John Gauging his anger She’s always watching
him like he’s a ticking time bomb

GRACE
Sorry

JOHN
Start again from the beginning of
the stanza

Grace flips the page back Starts up again -- messes up --
keeps going -- messes up again Stops She holds her hands
up They’re shaking

GRACE
I’m sorry

John gets up from his chair She can feel him getting closer
She doesn’t meet his eyes She can’t

JOHN
I know you wouldn’t ruin a
beautiful piece of music on
purpose would you

And for some reason that little accusation sparks something
in Grace It’s Bobby all over again Her face hardens

GRACE
Never

Eve heard the contempt in Grace’s voice John’s eyes narrow

JOHN
From the beginning then

She flips the page back PLAYS He studies her His eyes
trying to figure out what’s different all of a sudden
There’s a sort of defiance in Grace’s body language now

Her hands move over the keys quickly Efficiently She knows
how to play this piece and -- she HITS THE WRONG NOTE She
stops THAT she did on purpose

She turns her eyes up to his A beat He reaches down and
gently takes her right hand in his

JOHN
Sometimes it’s the easiest keys
that are the hardest to remember
You use this --

Grace CRIES OUT as John BREAKS HER FINGER

JOHN
-- finger to hit the C note

He caresses her broken finger She fights the pain surging
through her entire arm He casually locks eyes with Eve She
goes back to her book She’s staying out of this He lets go
of Grace’s hand It drops back onto the keys

JOHN
Start from the beginning again

Grace flips to the first page PLAYS And it hurts That C
note is common And every time she hits it the anger builds
and just as she gets in a rhythm she messes up again

GRACE
Sorry my finger slipped

Eve smirks behind her book John SMASHES the wooden key cover
down HARD Grace cries out Tears fall She can’t hold them
back He opens the cover and SLAMS IT DOWN AGAIN

GRACE
Please

He stops Triumphant That’s what he wanted to hear

JOHN
Try again And please take your
time I really hope that you
succeed this time

Red lines slash across Grace’s hands They tremble
sporadically She places them on the keys The fear in her
eyes Here goes

Eve slides in next to her Moves Grace’s right hand off the
keys Flips to the first page Settles in

EVE
Ready

A moment passes between them It’s them against John Grace
nods They PLAY No mistakes

INT BATHROOM
Grace sits on the rim of the tub Eve bandages her hands

GRACE
I gave in

EVE
I’m surprised you didn’t sooner

Grace smiles Proud of herself

GRACE
Did you see his face

EVE
Yeah I saw his face and you’re
lucky this is all he did to you
Messing with crazy is a very fine
line You have to pick and choose
your battles

Grace sighs There’s the reality

GRACE
I don’t know if I can play his
game I don’t know how you do it

EVE
It’s better than the alternative
Than out in that field

They sit together in silence Not looking at each other They
both know the horror of being out in the field

EVE
Sometimes I wonder who’s luckier
Us or the girls who never make it
into the house

Their eyes meet Neither of them really wanting to know the
answer to that
INT DINER - DAY

OLeary sits at the counter a file open before him There’s
that photo of Eve His eyes drift around the diner

BETH (0S)
What can I get you

She’s preoccupied with finding space to write on her pad

O’ LEARY
Grace working today

BETH
She doesn’t work here anymore

O’ LEARY
Did something happen to her

Beth reacts to the concern in his voice looks up from her
pad Slowly recognizes him

BETH
She left town Went to stay with
relatives I think she said

OLeary smiles Nods knowingly Beth notices the file

BETH
What’s all this

O’ LEARY
A case I’m working

Beth picks up Eve’s picture

O’ LEARY
You wouldn’t happened to have seen
that girl would you

A glimmer of recognition passes over Beth’s face

BETH
No Well she kinda looks familiar

O’ LEARY
She was here

BETH
Yeah well she didn’t come in She
was waiting in I guess her
boyfriend’s truck

Beth puts the photo back Not thinking much of it
BETH
I was getting off my shift and
walked past It was dark though I
could just be making it up

O’ LEARY
You know the name of the boyfriend

Beth is back to flipping through her pad
BETH
Nope

He’s come in a few times

He

brought in some sunflowers for us

once

He runs a farm like that

somewhere around here

How vague but it’s enough to
head into overdrive

SUPERTITLE DAY

kick the wheels in O’Leary’s

INT BEDROOM - DAY

Eve wakes
empty room

EVE
Grace

She looks at the clock Moves

Empty She turns back into the room
over to the window Squints She can

something that surprises her

EXT SUNFLOWER FIELD

The sky is full of clouds It’

Looks down at the book in

her lap Around the

to the doorway of the bathroom
Where is Grace She goes

barely make out

s the perfect day for a walk

John TALKS and Grace listens intently as they move through

the sea of yellow

JOHN

The simplicity of the flower has
always fascinated me

They emerge onto the road cutting through the field Grace
falls out of step with John Her eyes drift down the road

John bends at the edge of the
through his fingers He’s not
all She could make a run for
field thinking about it

JOHN
Grace

She snaps out of it
GRACE
Sorry there’s just

them it’s amazing

He studies her for a moment

second field Runs some dirt
paying attention to Grace at
it She looks back down the

so many of

JOHN
Do you miss him

GRACE
Who

JOHN
Bobby

That catches her by surprise

GRACE
No

She can see that wasn’t the best answer covers quickly

GRACE
Maybe Only sometimes

John nods That’s what he expected Grace is looking at him
the same way Eve does A meteorologist trying to map a storm

JOHN
I remember how every morning you
would stare into your bedroom
closet for a moment I always
wondered what was in there What
was the first thing that called to
you when you opened your eyes

Grace looks away then back

JOHN
You don’t have to tell me if you
don’t want to

Grace milks the dramatic pause

GRACE
Two black suitcases We kept them
in the corner of the closet

JOHN
I saw what he did to you It’s
important to me that you know what
you had with Bobby is nothing like
what we share

GRACE
I know With him it was

She looks away It’s hard for her to talk about this John
steps forward and places a comforting arm on her shoulder

GRACE
What you’ve given me is simple and
beautiful Just like what you said
about the sunflowers With Bobby it
never was

She smiles up at him He leans down and she closes her eyes
as they share a gentle kiss He wraps his arms around her

JOHN
I’m glad you understand

Grace opens her eyes They’re hollow Empty Bored But she
continues to hug him tight And the Oscar goes to

INT JOHN’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

John lounges in the tub Puffs on his cigar as Eve runs a
sponge over him

JOHN
What do you think of Grace

Eve takes a moment choosing her words wisely then

EVE
She’sdifferent

JOHN
From you yes In fact you two are
so different that you might just be
opposite sides of the same coin

Eve scoffs John locks serious eyes with her

JOHN
It’s true Now I see that I could
never have hoped to fully
appreciate either of you without
the other It’s the differences
that help me to better understand
both of you

EVE
But you already understand
everything about me

JOHN
I thought I did then it became
painfully obvious that I don’t

His hand goes to his side To his healed stab wound

EVE
Is that why you brought her into
the house

They stare at each other for a moment

JOHN
You Grace and Imaybe it’s
enough Now maybe you don’t have to
feel like you need to escape

He brushes a string of hair from her face

JOHN
or maybe now I just won’t chase
you

He holds her stare long enough to sear that point home then
he climbs from the tub and leaves

INT DINING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY

Grace and Eve set the table Eve sets out a glass It’s not
quite perfect Grace moves it slightly Eve tries not to let
it annoy her The back door opens They look up as John
enters with some sunflowers They both give him a smile

John walks around the table Eve waits Expecting the kiss
He passes her Goes to Grace Sticks a flower in her hair

JOHN
For my Sunflower

Eve flinches at the nickname Her nickname John puts the
rest of the flowers in the vase Leaves Grace touches the
flower Almost smiles Almost And that scares her

EVE
It’s weird right How for a split
second you can forget all the
terrible things he’s done to you
He almost seems normal

Grace looks away Ashamed she could feel that Eve doesn’t
really want to say it but

EVE
It happens to me too

GRACE
So I’m not crazy

EVE
No When it last for more than a
second then you should be worried

Eve leaves Grace to mull that over Should she be worried
INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Eve lies in bed all alone JOHN’S GRUNTS drift up from the
room below She listens Her jaw clenches

SUPERTITLE DAY 195

INT BEDROOM - DAY

Grace slams her book shut Impulsively gets up from the
window ledge with a frustrated groan

GRACE
I can’t read this stupid book
anymore

Eve reads on the bed

EVE
(not looking up from her
pages)
So pick another one

GRACE
I’m sick of reading I hate
reading God

She HURLS the book across the room It slams into the camera
in the corner It falls off the wall Hangs by its cord
Grace’s anger is cut off She didn’t mean to do that
EVE
That was stupid You’1l pay for
that later

Grace sneers at her the anger coming back

GRACE
Maybe

Eve goes back to her book Brushing Grace off

GRACE
How can you stand to be in this
house all the time

EVE
Because freaking out isn’t going to
do anything but give you and me a
headache The door unlocks in 20
minutes --

GRACE
Like being trapped downstairs is
any better

EVE
You know what I miss Catatonic
Grace

That stung Grace stews Her eyes drift to the bathroom An
idea hits her like a freight train

GRACE
I’m going into the hole

She moves for the bathroom

EVE
Don’t be stupid It’s not going to
lead outside

GRACE
I don’t care I have to get out of
this room

Eve scrambles up now Blocks the bathroom door

EVE

Will you calm down for a second and
think How are you going to get
back

Grace turns Pulls the bedsheet off the bed

GRACE
I‘1ll rip the bedsheet Use it as a
rope

EVE

Are you kidding me Come back from
fairy-tale town that’s not going
to work

Grace tries to get past Eve steps in her way again

GRACE
Move

EVE
Obviously you’ve made the mistake
of thinking you’re safe because
you’ve been in the house for a
couple of weeks and you’ve fucked
him a couple of times --

GRACE
Are you jealous

EVE
I’m trying to save your life Do
you really think after you try to
escape he’s going to bring you
back Why would he when he has me

GRACE
Because if you were enough I
wouldn’t even be in this house

Grace has just put a spotlight on the elephant in the room
and it STAMPEDES right over Eve An excruciatingly long beat
ensues then --

DING DONG It was faint They both stop breathing

DING DONG Holy shit They weren’t imagining it The bedsheet
floats to the ground forgotten as they rush to the window
They can just make out the REAR OF A CAR PARKED OUT FRONT

EVE
Someone’s here

She sees the car She hears the DOORBELL But she still can’t
believe it

EVE
No one ever comes here

GRACE
We have to signal them somehow Let
them know we’re trapped in here

EVE
How They can’t see or hear us from
up here

Grace makes a beeline for the bathroom

GRACE
The vent Wherever it leads could
be close enough to the door to get
their attention

EVE
Grace

Grace grabs up the bedsheet and shoves it at Eve
GRACE
Rip the sheet and tie it while I
climb down
They move into the BATHROOM Grace pushes the wallpaper back
EVE
Grace No Let’s just wait Our
door opens in five minutes then
well be downstairs --

Grace sits on the floor Slides her legs through the hole

GRACE
But no where near the front door

She turns over on her stomach Scoots in further

GRACE
and whoever it is could be gone
by then

EVE

Gracewait this is a bad --

She slides all the way in Out of view now
EVE

She SCREAMS releases her hands on instinct --

INT BASEMENT

Grace stands in the middle of the dark basement lit by the
glow of the of the TV screens There’s 15 MINI TV’S each
displaying a different room of the house all sitting on top

of their own VCR’s

She notices a monitor to the right Nothing but snow She
REWINDS a bit PLAY

It’s from their bedroom Eve reads on the bed Grace
impulsively gets up from the window ledge hurls the book a
beat later The camera goes out Snow She hits REWIND Then
RECORD Destroying the evidence

EXT BARN

O’Leary walks toward the barn The dogs BARK

O’ LEARY

IN THE BASEMENT Grace holds her breath Listens

O’LEARY (0S)

She moves to the water heater in the corner Wedges behind
it There’s a tiny window It’s barred up She stands on her
tippy toes She can just make out O’Leary from the waist
down She BANGS on the window Yells
GRACE
Down here Can you hear me Help
I’m down here

A PAIR OF COWBOY BOOTS step in front of the window Grace
stops immediately She knows those boots

BACK OUTSIDE OLeary cups his hands over his mouth yells

O’ LEARY
Hello Anybody

JOHN HENRY (0S)
Youre trespassing

OLeary whirls his hand going to his gun but it stops when
his eyes land on the 20 gauge shotgun in John’s hands

INT BASEMENT

Grace backs away from the window She heard John’s voice The
panic is in her entire body She turns for the vent shaft

EXT BARN
O’Leary puts his hands up slowly

O’ LEARY
Now hold on a second
(recognizing )
Professor Patrick O’Leary I

weeks ago

John doesn’t lower the gun

JOHN
What are you doing here

OLeary points to the house keeps his hands in the air

O’ LEARY
Do you live here

JOHN
For sixteen years You haven’t
answered my question

O’ LEARY
It’s kinda hard with a gun in my
face

INT VENT SHAFT

Grace is trying to climb back up herself SCREAMING out for
Eve in the process Eve pops back through the hole

EVE
You have to hurry

GRACE
Help me

Eve disappears A beat then -- the bed sheet rope is thrown
through the hole It stops well above Grace’s reach

EVE
Take the sheet

GRACE
I can’t reach it

EXT BARN
John’s lowered the gun now

O’ LEARY
No one answered Thought someone
might be out working in the fields

JOHN
Fair enough but you still haven’t
told me why you were ringing my
doorbell

O’Leary straightens up at John’s tone

O’ LEARY
I was following a leadabout Eve
Michaels

John doesn’t react at all

O’ LEARY
Your student Somebody told me they
might have seen her with you at a
diner near here

JOHN
No that was my wife
O’ LEARY
Your wife
JOHN

Yes married for 10 years

INT VENT SHAFT

Grace hasn’t progressed much She can’t pull up her own body
weight She’s still four beams from reaching the bedsheet

EVE
Grace come on We should be
downstairs by now

GRACE
I’m trying

EXT BARN
O’Leary turns in a small circle

O’ LEARY
This is a beautiful spread you got
here It’s just you and your wife

JOHN HENRY
Yes she has leukemia

OLeary stops accessing the area Locks eyes with John

O’ LEARY
I’m sorry to hear that

John’s face is washed in sadness

JOHN
I try to get her out as much as
possible but she says people look
at her like she’s sick So we keep
to ourselves and sunflowers
Sometimes I work all day don’t
have time to cook so we get take
out from the diner She always
waits in the car

OLeary nods believing every word kind of

INT VENT SHAFT

Grace slips a little Gains her bearings again She’s two
beams from the bed sheet rope now

INT BATHROOM
Eve opens the cabinet under the sink and wedges the bedsheet

in it She goes into the BEDROOM and over to the window John
and O’Leary are still talking Thank god

EXT BARN

O’Leary moves back for the front

O’ LEARY
Well I’m sorry to have bothered
you

JOHN

You said someone saw her In my
truck huh

O’ LEARY
Thought they did that’s all I’m
just grasping at straws coming up
with nothing

JOHN
Usually a man keeps coming up with
nothing he learns to move on

OLeary hesitates for a moment Was that a threat

INT VENT SHAFT

Grace stretches her hand up tries to grab the bed sheet
pokes her head back through

EVE
Hurry He’s coming in

GRACE
I’m trying Help me

Grace drags herself up to the next beam Eve watches her
sees Graces strength is waning

EVE
(under her breath )
I have to get downstairs

Graces eyes snap to Eve She sees it

GRACE
Eve no you have to help me

EVE
He’s coming We won’t make it

Grace reaches up Grabs the bedsheet

Eve

She

GRACE
Yes we will Just pull and I’1l
climb

Eve’s face has hardened

GRACE
EvenoEvedon’t leave me

EVE
I have to check I have to see
where he is

Her head disappears

GRACE
No Eve Come back

INT BEDROOM

Eve crosses to the window The back of O’Leary’s car pulls
off She scans the area No John She backpedals from the
window She looks between the bathroom and the door
Considering Help Grace or save herself

INT VENT SHAFT
Grace stares up waits for Eve to pop her head back in and --

GRACE
(sheer panic )
Eve EVE

She pulls on the sheet It doesn’t hold It floats down the
vent shaft She’s on her own And that knowledge comes first
as SHOCK then HORROR then ANGER She swallows back the
betrayal and CLIMBS

OUTSIDE John casually walks over to the dog pen with his
shotgun He sticks his hand through the fence Pets his dogs
for a second then turns for the house

IN THE VENT SHAFT Grace grits her teeth against the strain
of pulling herself up She gets up to the next ledge Takes a
small break to catch her breath She looks up There’s the
hole She can make it

AT THE BACK PORCH John crosses to the door Flips the keypad
cover up Punches in the code The door clicks open

IN THE VENT SHAFT Grace’s hand grips the beam right below
the hole

IN THE BACK HALLWAY John stops at the keypad

IN THE BATHROOM Grace’s arm comes through the hole and
clutches desperately at the bathroom tile trying to grab
some kind of leverage

INT DINING ROOM

John comes through the door Eve’s setting the table Nothing
out of the ordinary She looks up a flash of panic in her

eyes John has a SHOTGUN

JOHN
I just brought it in to clean it

He comes over and gives her a kiss

EVE
I wasn’t worried

JOHN
I know you weren’t

He goes to the cabinet Unlocks it Places the gun inside

GRACE
Where’s Grace

Eve freezes The moment she’s been dreading

JOHN
Eve

EVE
She’s --

GRACE (0S)
Right here

Grace stands in the doorway A salad bowl in her hands She
doesn’t look at the shocked look on Eve’s face her eyes are
on John He walks over to her

JOHN
We set the table before we bring
out the food

GRACE
I know I’m sorry I try to time it
just right but Eve was going a
little slower than usual today

Now she turns her eyes to Eve Daring her to challenge that
statement Eve wants to but keeps her mouth shut

JOHN
You’ve got some dirt on your face

He gently wipes it away If Grace could shoot fire from her
eyes Eve would be toast

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Grace and Eve lie as far apart as possible in the bed Turned
away from each other There’s a palpable tension in the
moonlit room

EVE
If he came in and neither of us
were downstairs he would have come
looking and we’d be caught

GRACE
Thank God you left me

A pain of guilt runs through Eve but --

EVE
I told you not to go into the wall

Grace’s jaw sets She tightens her grip on the covers

INT DINER —- DAY

JP hunches over a table in the back conspiring with someone
across from him

JP
We park around back stupid mutts
will never even know we’re there
Stuff he’s got in that barn We’1l
get at least 3000 for Maybe more

JP waits for a reaction from his friend It comes slow

JPS FRIEND (0S)
I don’t know man

JP
What the fuck is your problem I’m
talkin’ easy money I know you need
the cash Grace left your ass high
and dry --

REVERSE ANGLE
Bobby is JP’s friend and he’s livid
BOBBY
Shut the fuck up You don’t know
what you’re talking about
Bobby’s eyes drift to Beth taking an order He frowns up
JP
Look the only thing standing
between us and payday is a single

bolt padlock You in or not

SUPERTITLE DAY 200

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

It’s a silent dinner Eve studies John’s morose expression
eating as an after thought Grace’s eyes flick between them
John doesn’t look at either Grace clears her throat

GRACE
How’s the attic cleaning going

John forks peas into his mouth A beat then

EVE
John is something wrong

JOHN
Who broke the camera

He doesn’t look up from his plate The color drains from
Grace Eve smiles slightly Grace plays it remarkably cool

GRACE
What camera

John scoots back Stands

JOHN
I want to know who broke it

Grace sits up straighter Eve pushes away from the table
slightly She wants to tell Grace pleads to Eve with her
eyes not to

JOHN
Now

John SLAMS his fist on the table Plastic rattles Eve and
Grace flinch Eve opens her mouth but --

GRACE
It was me I did it

John doesn’t react Grace looks to Eve unsure of how that
went over Eve has no clue Grace turns back to John

GRACE
I’m sorry I didn’t mean --

He BACK HANDS her She topples back in the chair It was so
sudden and violent that no one moves for a second

JOHN
If it was an accident you wouldn’t
have kept it a secret from me

Grace cowers on the floor He advances Eve stands

EVE
John

He grabs Grace by the arms YANKS her to her feet She throws
her hands up to shield herself

GRACE
Please

Eve scans the room quickly What could be a weapon John
pulls his arm back to get a full swing but --

GRACE
Eve did it

He hesitates Eve’s eyes snap right back to Grace

EVE
What

GRACE
She threw a book at it

Eve’s mouth drops

EVE
You threw the book

John’s eyes narrow on Grace

GRACE
I said I did it because I knew
you’d get mad I didn’t want you to

hurt her

And Grace does what she does best She looks innocent John’s

rage falters a bit He looks to Eve

EVE
John she’s lying Why would I
break it Why now

GRACE
She’s trying to escape again

And those were the magic words John lets go of Grace
completely turns to Eve across the table

EVE
No

GRACE
She found a hole in the bathroom
wall

Eve points the finger at Grace Takes a step towards her

EVE
She found the hole

GRACE
She’s been in the heating vent In
the basement

JOHN
You’ve been in the basement

Eve steps towards him almost pleading

EVE

No
(to Grace )
Why are you lying

Grace ignores her Continues to pump John full of hot air

GRACE
She told me she was going to break
the camera and then erase the tape
so you wouldn’t know

EVE
Erase I don’t even know --

GRACE
She’s been down there more than
once Trying to find a way out
Messing with your stuff

Grace is pushing all the right buttons John’s quiet rage is
about to spill over

EVE
Shut up

GRACE
All she talks about is how she’s
going to really get away this time

EVE
Shut up

GRACE
I was going to tell you I should
have told you

EVE
SHUT UP

SLAP Grace’s head rocks to the side and back Eve slapped
her that HARD John grabs Eve THROWS her back into the wall
Grace allows a tiny smile She’s not in trouble anymore

EVE
No John she’s lying

He drags her to her feet Pulls her towards the door

EVE
What are you doing

JOHN
You’ve disrespected my house Eve
You’re going outside

She struggles now She CAN’T go back outside

EVE
No Listen to me No

Grace watches Eve KICK and SCREAM Attempt to put her body
weight against the door so he can’t open it And it slowly
dawns on her what she’s done What winning this little
competition between her and Eve really means

GRACE
(oh god)
John

He throws open the door Drags Eve through it Grace moves
after them stretches out a hand

GRACE
John wait Stop

He SLAMS the door in her face

EXT BACK PORCH

Eve’s ass bumps down the steps as John drags her She has one
hand on his hand gripping her hair The other one thrashes
out at him --

EVE
Listen to me She’s lying

-- it’s useless She can’t get her feet back under her She’s
at an odd twisted angle and too close to John to get enough
momentum to hit him

JOHN
Stop it Eve You knew this day was
coming

EVE
Fuck you

She DRAGS HER NAILS SAVAGELY across his arm He drops her

with a curse She scrambles to get to her feet He wraps his
arms around her from behind -- they come up together and --
they both STOP DEAD their eyes staring across the clearing

REVERSE ANGLE

JP and Bobby shuffle out the barn carrying an expensive and
heavy piece of equipment They keep to the shadows -- moving
quickly then -- Bobby stops cold JP turns to see why --

A frozen forever moment JP and Bobby stare John and Eve
stare It’s the quiet before the storm Eve reacts first

EVE
Help me

Bobby drops his end of the equipment RUNS JP’s only a step

behind John whirls -- lifts Eve and carries her quickly over
to the dog pen Four presses of his finger on the electronic

lock and -- three RAVENOUS DOGS tear across the clearing

EXT BACK OF BARN

JP rounds the barn at full speed Slips in the dirt Bobby
slams into the front of the truck parked 10 feet away He
clambers around to the passenger side Yanks the handle but --

BOBBY
You locked it

JP gets to the driver’s door Digs for his keys Bobby slams
his palms against his window

BOBBY
YOU LOCKED IT

123 dogs barrel around the barn BARKING Killer eyes
on them JP fumbles with the keys his eyes darting from them
to the dogs

JP
Shit Shit Shit

The dogs are getting too close Fuck this He TAKES OFF for
the sunflower field Bobby watches him go

BOBBY
JP JP

He runs after him the dogs on his heels now

EXT JOHN’S HOME

John throws Eve against the GIANT TRACTOR parked on the side
of the barn

EVE
John

He handcuffs her to it Moves off

EVE
John wait
EXT SUNFLOWER FIELD
JP and Bobby run -- pushing -- pushing -- pushing -- on a mad

sprint through the sunflowers spurred on by the sound of the
dogs SNAPPING at their heels

EXT BARN

Eve yanks her arm with abandon once twice harder
Desperate attempts to wrench her hand free The SPOTLIGHTS on
top of John’s truck wash over her It spits dirt into her
face as it powers down the road between the fields

EXT SUNFLOWER FIELD

Eye level with the still sunflowers Just FAINT at first but
growing LOUDER we hear the POUNDING FOOTSTEPS of JP

He rips through the flowers Some break some just bend
others sway back into place in his wake only to be pushed
aside again as BOBBY plows through them

He stumbles a bit and it’s enough A dog LEAPS onto his
back bringing him down instantly The other two dogs are on
top of him at once BITING SPITTING and CLAWING at him

JP doesn’t even turn back at Bobby’s SCREAMS

INT DINING ROOM

Grace sits alone at the table Utterly devastated Still
caught in the horror of what she just did She looks around
at the remains of the interrupted meal Starts to clear the
table in a daze

EXT SUNFLOWER FIELD

The dogs have backed off slightly Bobby is a mess of
shredded skin and blood muttering in pain on the ground

John pushes through the flowers shotgun at his side Bobby
holds up a weak hand tries to say something but spits up
nothing but blood

John raises the shotgun Hesitates For a moment he doesn’t
believe his eyes Is that --

JOHN
Bobby

There’s a flash of acknowledgement in Bobby’s face John
considers for a moment Lowers his gun He pulls a yellow
filled syringe from his pocket

EXT BARN

Eve slumps against the tractor Defeated A wave of emotion
threatens to take her but she swallows it back

JP stumbles out of the edge of the sunflower field He’s
staggering back towards his truck Eve jumps up

EVE
Hey Over here Hey

He turns to her still half moving away sees she’s
handcuffed to the tractor

EVE
You have to help me

He looks back towards the field How close is John

EVE
Please He’s going to kill me

JP slows and against his better judgement he runs toward
Eve The relief floods her face She actually smiles

JP
What the fuck is going on here

EVE
He kidnapped me

She pulls at the handcuffs

EVE
We have to get these off

JP pulls frantically at the cuffs Eve bites back the pain
She can’t take it anymore

EVE
Stop That’s not working

He starts to backpedal

JP
You’re stuck

Eve grabs his arm She’s not going to let him get away
EVE

You have to get something to break
the chain

JP
What --

EVE
In the barn Cutters or something
Hurry

JP has a post traumatic beat How did he get in this
situation Eve lets go of his arm pushes him away

EVE
Go Before he comes back

JP does as she says and that’s when he sees the FLOODLIGHTS
of John’s truck floating back towards them He stops cold He
turns back Locks apologetic eyes with her

EVE
Noyou can’t leave me

JP
I‘1l call the police
EVE
No --
He turns and runs
EVE

NO DON’T LEAVE ME

She tries to grab him but the cuffs snag her back He
disappears around the barn

John’s Chevy blasts off the road between the sunflower
fields U-turns and comes to a swerving stop John throws
open his door Stands on the ledge reaches up and moves the
floodlights around Using them to search the fields

JOHN
(yelling )
Where are you

Eve slowly turns to look at John then back the way JP went
She could keep her mouth shut let JP get away maybe he’1l
call for help maybe she’1ll still be alive but that’s one
too many maybe’s for her --

EVE
He went that way

She points with her non-cuffed hand

EVE
Around the barn He’s around the
barn

John hops back in the truck Whips it around Eve drops her
head Disgusted with herself

INT JP’S TRUCK

JP jams the keys into the ignition Turns them as he looks up
through the windshield -- John’s Chevy FISHTAILS around the
barn slowing slightly as it regains traction

JP
Shit

He throws the truck in reverse Hits the gas The tires spin
and the truck lurches back just as John’s Chevy comes nose to
nose with it

EXT BACK OF BARN

There’s a narrow strip of a dirt road that leads out JP’s
truck picks up speed fast bumps over the uneven ground
John’s Chevy’s rides the front bumper

INT JP’S TRUCK

JP looks back -- narrowly misses a GIANT POT HOLE -- looks
forward sees -- John’s SHOTGUN poking out the window aiming
right for him

JP
Shit

He ducks turning the wheel as he goes -- his truck cuts
quickly off the dirt path John’s Chevy swerves madly to the
side -- NARROWLY MISSES clipping the front bumper

JP sits back up now -- has a brief second of relief turns to
see where he’s going --

BAM
His truck bed accordions in on itself as it SLAMS INTO A

TREE The window above the seats spider cracks as JP SMASHES
INTO IT FACE FIRST

EXT DIRT ROAD

John’s Chevy door pops open He gets out bringing his shot
gun with him He casually walks the few feet it takes to get
to JP’s truck Pops open the driver’s side door

JP falls out barely conscious Blood covers his entire face
He’s missing his front teeth John watches him squirm on the
ground for a second raises his shotgun and --

EXT BARN

KLACK Eve flinches as the SHOT RINGS OUT more blood
technically on her hands in her quest to survive

INT DINING ROOM

Grace stares into the empty dining room She’s cleared
everything off the table She still can’t believe Eve’s gone
A beat Another Then she clicks off the light

EXT BARN

John’s Chevy pulls to a stop in front of Eve He gets out
She doesn’t say anything He unlocks the handcuffs

JOHN
Thank you For not letting him get
away

Eve breaths a sigh of relief Rubs her sore wrist

EVE
I did it for us

John smiles Kisses her softly as he takes her hand

JOHN
Come on
Eve lets him lead her until -- she realizes they’re heading
AWAY FROM THE HOUSE
EVE

Wait Where are we going
John tightens his grip on her hand
EVE

John I thought -- I told you where
he was

JOHN
And I appreciate thatbut it
doesn’t change anything

Eve’s face drops She tries to resist walking with him -- he
YANKS her around -- grabs a fist full of her hair with the
other hand and -- continues to drag her SCREAMING out to the

sunflower field just like before

INT BEDROOM

Grace lies awake in bed facing away from the door There’s a
CREAK in the hallway Another Someone’s coming

The door swings open John is backlit by the hallway light
She turns over looks at him expectantly

EXT JOHN’S HOME

Grace wraps her arms around herself shivering in the night
breeze John leads her towards the barn She glances down the
path to the sunflower field with trepidation

GRACE
Where’s Eve

John doesn’t answer and she doesn’t dare ask again He
slides open the barn door Waits for her to go inside she
steps in reluctantly --

INT BARN

-- and her eyes go wide as they fall on BOBBY STRUNG UP
Hanging on a long chain going up to the rafters his toes
barely scraping the ground

His clothes are ripped into shreds exposing the bite marks
everywhere His head hangs down his chin to his chest

GRACE
Bobby

She can barely push his name out past her shock She goes to
him Gently lifts his head His eyes are glazed over vacant
at first then they focus on her He screams but with the
drugs it only comes out as a GUTTURAL MOAN

GRACE
Oh god

Bobby continues his ragged moans

JOHN (0S)
He can’t feel anything

Grace whirls around and steps away from Bobby His head sags
to the side resting on his arm John just stands in the
doorway completely calm

JOHN
Phenprobamate It’s an anaesthesia
It completely paralyzes you

John steps into the barn Pulls the door closed behind him

JOHN
Bobby and one of his friends were
trying to steal from me

Grace looks to Bobby Is that true All he can do is plead
with his eyes scream his muted screams

JOHN
My dogs got to him first I
apologize that you have to see him
this way

Grace doesn’t shy away as John comes up and takes her hands
Bobby stops screaming shocked by this display of intimacy

GRACE
What are you going to do to him

JOHN
I’m going to kill him

A surge of emotion hits Grace She looks away Tries to bite
it back John pulls her chin back to him

JOHN
You loved him It was difficult
but you did And you might think
that makes you weak but it’s just
the opposite Grace It’s much
harder to love someone through the
bad

They lock eyes now

JOHN
That’s what makes you special

He moves over to the tool cabinet in the corner Unlocks a
drawer Grace glances back at Bobby His eyes have turned
into cold hatred

JOHN (0S)
Here Grace

John holds a MEDIUM SIZED HUNTING KNIFE Grace looks from the
knife to Bobby’s wide eyed stare realizes

GRACE
No

JOHN
Yes You want to Take it

Bobby’s eyes go wider as Grace tentatively reaches for the
knife Wraps her hand around the handle She just holds it
for a second feeling the weight of it

JOHN
It‘ll help you to let go of it

She turns towards Bobby raising the knife He starts his
muffled screams again Struggles to move John comes behind
Grace Close Whispers in her ear almost

JOHN
He used you to feel strong and he
deserves just as much pain as he
gave you Everything I have tried
to teach you you understand
That’s why I’m sharing this with
you It’ll change everything

John’s been slowly moving Grace toward Bobby She’s within
striking distance now Tears roll down Bobby’s cheeks

JOHN
Trust me

There’s an intensity building in Grace She wants to God
does she want to but --

GRACE
I can’t

She backs right into John Let’s the knife fall from her
hand And then it hits her in a wave of nausea -- she really
did want to do it She bends and THROWS UP

John stares down at her Disappointed Then he picks up the
knife and steps around her He dusts off the handle his eyes
falling on Bobby What’s the best way to cut him

SUPERTITLE DAY 203

INT DINING ROOM - DAY

Breakfast John reads the newspaper Grace pushes the food
around on her plate She’s got no appetite left John checks
his watch Stands

JOHN
After your morning chores can you
draw a bath for me please

GRACE
Yes

JOHN
In your bathroom

Grace’s head snaps up What Why

JOHN
I’m bringing Eve back into the
house

Grace drops her fork Shocked

JOHN
--you should help her get cleaned

up

INT BATHROOM

The wall hole has been snuggly boarded up with a steel plate
Eve sits deathly still in the half-filled tub She’s covered
in cuts bruises and dirt

Grace stands right outside the doorway Doesn’t dare go any
further in than that An ugly silence fills the gap Eve
reaches forward Picks up the soap Slowly begins to wash the
blood and dirt away

INT BEDROOM

Eve sits in the window Updates her notches from the time she
was gone Grace sits on the bed Not reading her book but
watching Eve Someone has to break the silence She closes
her book gets off the bed

GRACE
Eve listen --

BAM Grace staggers back What the fuck just happened EVE
THREW “ROBINSON CRUSOE” IN HER FACE She jumps up now --
SLAMS against Grace pushing her back into the bookcase

EVE
YOU FUCKING LIAR

Books fall as Eve slams Grace again

EVE
I’M GOING TO KILL YOU

Eve’s had days to build up this rage Grace tries to fight
back tries to spit out a response but she’s being
suffocated by Eve’s fury

EVE
BITCH I’LL KILL YoU

They spin around Fall onto the bed Eve gets on top Wraps
her hands around Grace’s neck and SQUEEZES

EVE
I‘1l kill you
Grace flings her arm out -- hits the book she was reading
She gets a grip on it and -- SLAMS it across Eve’s face Eve

falls over to the side Grace coughs up a lung pushes away
and stumbles into the BATHROOM

Eve slams against the other side of the door Grace grabs the
doorknob Struggles to keep the door closed as Eve struggles
just as hard to get in

GRACE
Eve Stop Stop Please I’m sorry
I’m so sorry Just listen to me
Why are we fighting Why are we
doing this to each other

Eve’s rage is exhausting her and Grace’s words seep in
through the cracks

GRACE
It’s supposed to be us against him

Eve beats the last of it out on the door Slumps down against
it breathing hard She’s just exhausted She leans her head
against the door frame

ON THE OTHER SIDE Grace is still braced for an attack After
a second of nothing she slumps to the ground too

GRACE
(beyond relieved )
It’s supposed to be us against him
A beat Both girls catch their breath
EVE
He’s going to kill both of us both
It’s just a matter of time

Grace opens the door wider so that she can see Eve

GRACE
Our only chance is if we escape

EVE
I’ve tried

GRACE
Not with me

begins plays throughout the following scenes

decisive stop They have a plan

SUPERTITLE DAY 216

INT BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Grace and Eve in bed Neither of them attempt sleep They
stare up at the ceiling in silence then

GRACE
When he took you out to the
sunflower field I thought for sure
he was going to kill you

EVE
He was

Grace turns on her side so she can see Eve

GRACE
How did you change his mind

EVE
I did something I’ve never done for
him before I begged and pleaded I
cried I became you

Grace’s face bunches up That stung There’s a long deep
pause Eve takes a deep breath and

EVE

By the third time I tried to
escape I knew he needed the girls
in the sunflower field or else he
couldn’t keep a girl in the house
Trying to escape gave him the
excuse he needed I gave him an
excuse even though I knew it would
cost another girl her life

(then )
I don’t want to die

Grace turns back on her back

GRACE
What happens after we escape

And that just hangs in the air

EXT SUNFLOWER FIELD - EVENING

sunflower fields ablaze

It’s buckling One more heave and it gives

He staggers into the bedroom No Eve No Grace He stalks
over to the bathroom Pushes the door open and sees

THE WALL HOLE

Freshly made Smaller than the one Grace found John’s face
distorts in pure rage They’ve been planning this

He turns back into the bedroom Goes to the bed Flips the

mattress completely off He picks up the shot gun taped to
the bed frame

BACK IN THE VENT SHAFT Grace struggles Eve tries to pull
her up but it’s taking all her strength to keep Grace from
dropping completely

BLAM That one was thisclose to Eve’s face She falls back
and they TUMBLE together down the heating vent

Grace hits the bottom hard Eve lands right on top of her
Knocking the wind out of her Eve doesn’t give her a chance
to get her breath back She kicks out the vent and moves
into the BASEMENT

She scans the room as Grace sucks in air

GRACE
Whatare we going todo now

Eve moves over to the monitors Scans them There She finds
John He’s coming down the stairs to the second landing

EVE
He’s coming for us

She points at the monitor Grace follows John as he flips
from the different cameras making his way to them

GRACE
What are we going to do

Eve’s eyes search the half lit basement

GRACE
Eve what are we going --

EVE
Shut up and let me think

Grace shuts up Eve’s eyes lock on a box by the water heater

Over there

She drags Grace with her Grace’s eyes stay on John jumping
across monitors Eve throws open the box Red wires Blue

LIGHT’S CUT OFF throughout the house in a domino effect

ON THE STAIRS John curses Someone is really going to pay
for this

EXT JOHN’S HOME

CLICK The lock on the dog pen The door drifts open a crack

INT BASEMENT

BLACK OUT A slither of light comes from the window behind
the water heater The shear panic is in Grace’s voice

GRACE
What are you doing I can’t see
where he is

EVE
It’s easier to hide in the dark

There’s a familiar CLICK by the door Eve sucks in a deep
breath Grips Grace’s arm Grace heard it too

GRACE

They run blind across the basement Scramble up the stairs

EXT JOHN’S HOME

The BACK UP GENERATOR near the dog pen HUMS to life

They stumble back down the stairs

INT BACK HALLWAY

John stops halfway down the hallway at the basement door He
pushes the code in Opens it slowly

INT BASEMENT

raises the gun as he takes one cautious step in He can
barely see anything The light from the TV’s help but not
much He takes another step down and now we see

GRACE AND EVE

under the stairs They hold their breaths Watch as John
takes another step Another He lets go of the door moving
more confidently down the stairs now

Eve quietly slides the broom in her hand up Catches the door
before it has a chance to close She nods to Grace Grace
reaches out through the stairs -- she really doesn’t want to
be the one to do this but -- she GRABS John’s leg

He’s taken by surprise trips up and TOPPLES the rest of the
way down the stairs The shot gun skids across the floor

EVE
Go

They come out from under the stairs John’s dazed doesn’t
try to chase them They slam the door behind them as John
shakily gets to his feet
IN THE DINING ROOM Eve and Grace run through the darkness

INT HALLWAY
Eve pulls Grace down the hallway

GRACE
How will we get to the attic We
can’t go in the walls again

Eve shushes her as they disappear out of frame

A beat later John crashes onto the landing at the far hall
He flashes the light around Walks slowly down the hallway
Stops Listens Puts his ear to the wall Are they in there

He moves to the door on the right Pushes the key code in It
pops open It’s a storage closet He makes sure to keep a
look out as he pulls a long thin wire rod from it

He closes the door with his foot Lifts the rod up and uses
it to catch on the latch to the door of the attic He pulls
it down the steps leading to the attic coming with it

INT ATTIC
Junk is strewn here and there It looks like someone was

trying to organize it all John’s head pokes up through the
floor Scans the room A NOISE echoes from down the hall

INT HALLWAY

John slides back down the stairs Pushes them back up his
eyes on the hallway in front of him The noise came from Eve
and Grace’s room He cautiously makes his way towards it

The door is cracked He pushes it open with his gun ready to
fire and --

GRACE AND EVE COME OUT OF THE DARKNESS behind him They both
use two hands to shove him into the room Grace pulls the
door closed

BLAM He shoots out a section of the door Grace stares at
the hole at how only a few more inches to the left and he
would have put a hole right through her

Eve pulls her over to the rod Uses it to drag the stairs
down as John continues to BLAST through the door

INT ATTIC

Eve helps Grace up They move to the window with the AC unit
and PUSH -- the AC topples end over end down the slopped
shingles and over the side

Grace stares after it with trepidation Eve’s already
climbing out the window

IN THE HALLWAY John breaks through the rest of the door

EXT ROOF

Eve and Grace slide down the roof to the edge Stare over
There’s a GIANT TREE on this side of the house Other than
that it’s three very long stories to the ground

EVE
Ready

She throws her legs over the side

No I can’t do this Maybe we can
climb from the edge

EVE
No We have to jump It’s the
quickest way

GRACE
Well never make --

Her attention snaps to the window There’s John looking
furious Eve capitalizes on the distraction -- JUMPS --
taking Grace with her
They fall through the air Grace just a bit behind Eve
SCREAMING her head off Eve SLAMS into a tree limb Hangs
Grace passes her and YANKS her down with her They crash
the ground with BONE SHATTERING IMPACT

John stalks back toward the attic stairs

EXT JOHN’S HOME

Eve drags herself to a sitting position and it’s painful
takes her a moment to realize Grace isn’t moving

EVE
Come on Grace you gotta wake up

She lightly slaps Grace on the face

EVE

Eve looks around They’re wasting valuable time Grace sti

EVE

INT JOHN’S HOME

John stalks through the house Reloads Livid

EXT JOHN’S HOME

Eve basically carries Grace around the side The flood lights
snap on ILLUMINATING TWO ATTACK DOGS across the clearing Eve
and Grace freeze

GRACE
Oh fuck

The dogs haven’t noticed them yet They’re busy hunting
something near the barn

EVE
We’re going to have to make a run
for the truck

Eve looks across the clearing to the truck Judges

EVE

And we’re going to have to go fast
GRACE

Okay
EVE

Ready

Grace nods even though the answer is no

EVE
On three 1 2

A BARK from behind them They spin around to see the THIRD
DOG He’s already back on his hind legs ready to attack

EVE
RUN

They tear off and it’s like the dog understood the word too
because he springs off at the same time BARKING which
alerts the other dogs to the chase

It’s clear the dogs are going to meet with Eve and Grace
before Eve and Grace meet with the Chevy The dog behind them
leaps and SINKS HIS TEETH into Eve’s wrist

She SCREAMS OUT in pain as she’s yanked to the side She
trips over Grace’s legs and they both go down Grace quickly
gets to her feet The other two dogs are in hot pursuit

The dog has his teeth deep in Eve’s wrist shaking it back
and forth like a chew toy The keys fly from Eve’s hand

EVE
Get him off me

Grace reacts on instinct Her leg shoots out -- slams into
the dogs nose Jackpot It’s whirls away with a whimper

Eve crawls back on her ass Grace pulls her up And they’re
running again The other two dogs right behind them

They slam into the truck breaking momentum and wrench the
door open Grace goes first drags Eve in after her Eve
pulls the door closed as the dogs LEAP against it Grace
slides right over to the driver seat

GRACE
Give me the keys

A desperate hollow laugh escapes from Eve

GRACE
Eve

EVE
I dropped them

GRACE
What

Eve holds up her bloodied hand Laughs again

EVE
I dropped them

Grace leans over Eve and stares out the window past the
jumping snarling dogs at the keys on the ground

GRACE
How could you drop them

EVE
I think the dog had something to do
with it

Grace shoots her a wild stare How can she be laughing right
now Eve’s losing it that’s how

The front windshield SHATTERS Eve and Grace duck Once the
glass stops flying they look up to see

JOHN

coming down the porch steps Shotgun smoking They duck again
as he FIRES

GRACE

We can’t stay here
EXT JOHN’S HOME
John snaps open the shotgun Loads two more shells The
driver side door of his Chevy pops open Grace and Eve make a
run for the barn The dogs run around the Chevy after them
John snaps the shotgun closed Eve and Grace make it to barn
door Slide it open slightly John aims FIRES The buckshot
smashes into the thick wood of the barn door as it
INT BARN
-Slides closed Grace and Eve pull the beam lock down They
back away Wait for something to happen The dogs just BARK

on the other side They wait for another beat then

GRACE
He knows he can’t get in

She allows a little smile

EVE
And that we can’t get out

that goes right back into a frown They just can’t catch a
break And in this semi-still moment it’s catching up to her
A quick sob escapes

EVE
Grace

She turns away bites her lip

EVE
Grace

GRACE
I’m okay okay

Eve grabs her chest with her handcuffed arm pulling Grace
back around and now she sees Eve’s in PANIC ATTACK MODE Her
chest heaves up and down erratically She shuts her eyes

GRACE
NoEve you can’t do this now
Please

OUTSIDE John pulls a gasoline can from the truck bed
INSIDE Grace holds Eve at arm’s distance
GRACE
You have to breath okay Cause if
you don’t We’re going to die so I

need you to control this

OUTSIDE John douses the front of the barn with gasoline
Tosses the can Pulls out his matchbook Strikes a match

INSIDE Grace and Eve hunch down doing Lamaz breathing now
Two in and one out Two in and one out It’s not helping
Grace shakes Eve by the shoulders

GRACE
Come on focus on your breathing

Two in and -- she caught a whiff of the SMOKE She rises her
eyes widening

GRACE
Get up

Eve continues to hyperventilate Grace pulls her up

GRACE
Get up The barn is on fire

She moves to the door Grabs the steel beam lock Pulls back
with a hiss She holds her burnt hand

OUTSIDE John stands in front of the burning barn

JOHN
Come out

INSIDE Grace startles at his voice Eve is only focused on
her panic attack She curls up moves to sit down again

JOHN (0S)
There’s only one way out You wait
too long and you’1ll be coming out
as ashes

The anger overtakes Grace she screams

GRACE
YOULL DESTROY YOUR BARN

No answer Grace screams out in frustration She’s had enough
of this Enough She scans the barn Locks on the toolbox

She stalks over to it dragging Eve behind her PULLS at the
drawers They’re all locked She pushes the entire toolbox
over It hits the ground a drawer or two POPPING OPEN

Graces face says it all Finally some luck She bends and
digs quickly through the tools Black smoke fills the barn
now She coughs chokes a little digs deep in the drawer
and comes back out with a BAND SAW

OUTSIDE the flames almost cover the entire front of the
barn John waits He could wait all day for killing

INSIDE Grace knocks the shit off the table in the corner and
stretches the handcuff chain out

GRACE
Hold it tight

Eve holds on to her chest with one hand watches Grace and
her newfound determination as she goes to work on the chain

GRACE
Okay Eve by the time these
handcuffs come off you’ve gotta be
breathing again because we’re
going to have to make a run for it
And if you can’t I will leave your
ass behind

Grace pauses Locks eyes with Eve She serious She gets back
to sawing Fueled by a familiar anger Eve attempts to fight
the panic attack now

OUTSIDE John picks up his keys One of the dogs trots up He
pets it Lets it lick his hand his eyes on the flames

BACK INSIDE the chain finally BREAKS Grace immediately
covers her mouth from the smoke

GRACE
You okay

Eve nods Her breathing has returned to normal as much as it
can in the haze of smoke at least Grace turns

GRACE
There’s probably something else you
can use for a weapon in here --

Eve grabs her arm Grace turns back What

EVE
Thanks

The word sounds weird on Eve’s tongue but she means it A
BEAM near the front of the barn buckles COLLAPSES That
brings the reality back in They’re in a burning barn They
move for the toolbox Dig through it

GRACE
We could use the saw to cut a hole
in the back

Eve notices something out of the corner of her eye

GRACE
If we’re lucky he’1ll still think --

EVE
I have an idea

Her eyes are on the giant tractor in the corner

OUTSIDE flames engulf the entire front of the barn John
looks on with a quiet reverence He’s sacrificing everything
inside including his girls

There’s a slight REVVING from inside He raises his shotgun
Cocks his head He knows that noise but can’t quit place it
Suddenly his eyes go wide realizing a second too late as --

THE TRACTOR BURSTS THROUGH THE WALL OF FLAMES
He dives out of the way as the tractor plows by with Eve at

the wheel and Grace riding shotgun John’s on his feet ina
flash Takes off for his truck

EXT SUNFLOWER FIELD

The tractor shoots down the road between the sunflower
fields John wasn’t lying about how fast it could go But
it’s still just a tractor and John’s truck is gaining fast

GRACE
Faster

Eve’s got her foot all the way down on the gas

EVE
I can’t

BLAM Sparks fly as the buckshot hits the back of the
tractor John’s got his shotgun pointed out the non-existent
windshield Grace screams Eve swerves the tractor back and
forth trying to be a hard target

BLAM More sparks More screaming Eve cuts into the field
John fishtails across the dirt as he follows Sunflowers are
ruined as the tractor bulldozes over them

GRACE
He’s still coming

Eve glances back

GRACE
Eve

EVE
I heard you

GRACE
Do something

John’s almost on top of themand -- Eve BRAKES

John’s Chevy SMASHES into the back of the tractor at 50 mph
Eve and Grace are rocked forward then back Eve cradles her
neck Grace looks back John’s slumped over in the front
seat She allows a small breath of hope in

GRACE
Is he dead --

John sits back Blood pouring from his nose Locks deadly
eyes with her

GRACE
Gogo

Eve hits the gas The tires spin for a second then the
tractor lurches off

INT JOHNS CHEVY

John reaches for the keys in the ignition Turns them The

engine SPUTTERS Dies He slams the steering wheel with a
curse Turns the keys again

EXT SUNFLOWER FIELD

through the sunflowers heading for the edge of the field

EVE
Is he back there

GRACE
No Keep going he’s not following

They break out of the sunflower field

EVE
Oh fuck

She sees the massive ditch coming up before the road She
hits the brakes but the tractor doesn’t slow down

ON THE BACK OF THE TRACTOR the brake line is torn to pieces

GRACE
What are you doing Stop

EVE
I’m trying to

But she can’t They SCREAM as the tractor runs the ditch
down Grace BAILS at the last second as the tractor goes
right over the edge and CRASHES

then steels herself as John’s Chevy pulls up

Adrenaline and fear drives Grace heaving stumbling running
down the deserted road

INT JOHN’S UNDERGROUND WORK LAB

Eve tumbles down the stairs Head first Then feet first
Lands on her stomach sliding across the wet floor John

bounds down the doors shutting behind him BLACK OUT

JOHN
I gave you so many chances

Eve scrambles to her feet in the darkness John MOVES AROUND

JOHN
-and you ruined everything

EVE
Am I supposed to apologize

Her eyes search Where is he Where the fuck is he Click
The work lamp dangles from the cord illuminates --

BAM

She falls back onto the bed from the blow Scrambles across
it John grabs an ankle Drags her back She lashes out with
her free foot Catches him in the shoulder Ear Mouth

He drags her right off the bed She hits the dirt hard He
picks her up and slams her back on the bed Reaches for the
chains She lashes out with her hands legs just trying to
make some significant damage and --

Catches him in the CROTCH She’s able to get a hand up --
RAKES him across the face with her nails He falls over onto
the bed a hand protecting his face and crotch

Eve grabs one of the chains It CLINKS around the brass bed
coming free as she wraps it around John’s neck and PULLS He
rears back his hands immediately going to the rusted chain
digging into his neck

Eve jumps on his back to stay with him She pulls as hard as
she can Twists the chain around tighter in her hands

EVE
DIE

And she means it She twists and turns with him riding him
like a mechanical bull

He reels back FAST SLAMS HER AGAINST the wooden cabinet in
the corner It shatters Eve is stunned She drops to the
ground among the shit that falls from the cabinet

EXT ROAD

Grace slows now First to a jog then stops completely She
breathes heavily stares out at the dark empty road

stretching out before herthen --

Something changes in her The fear is gone She turns around

INT JOHN’S UNDERGROUND WORK LAB

John drags Eve up Slugs her twice in the face Then two hard
ones to the gut Eve doubles over He grabs her by the hair
Snaps her head back so she can see him

JOHN
After everything I gave you this
is what you do to me

She SPITS in his face He SMASHES HIS FOREHEAD against hers
Drags her around and THROWS her across the table in the
corner like a pro-wrestler only this shit is REAL

She slides across the top of the table and to the ground on
the other side like a rag doll She turns over on her
stomach Holy fuck did that hurt John moves to the shattered
cabinet Digs through it

JOHN
Youve outstayed your welcome Eve

He pulls out a hunting knife Turns back for her

From where Eve is on the floor she can see a SYRINGE under
the table She reaches out for it John grabs her legs drags
her back Flips her pulls her up and --

She STABS HIM IN THE NECK WITH THE SYRINGE Grinds the
plunger down He pushes her back She staggers into the far
wall as he rips the syringe from his neck He stares at it in
disbelief Eve smiles through the pain

EVE
I win

And the fury comes back to John now He advances She grabs a
thick piece of the broken cabinet Swings when he’s in
striking distance He takes the blow Slashes with the knife

She dodges Swings again John clocks her with a right She
slams the wood into his side They’re playing for keeps now

Eve manages to hit John’s hand He drops the knife but
continues to come at her with his fist Another beat of ASS
KICKING on both sides then the drugs start to kick in Eve
doesn’t let up

Wood splinters FLY as she continues to beat John until it’s
absolutely clear that he’s on the ground paralyzed She
staggers to a stop Stares down at him taking deep breaths
Deep relieved breaths And she LAUGHS

EVE
Don’t worryyou won’t feel any of
this later You’1ll be dead

She raises the piece of wood high This is the end -- she
GASPSher eyes go wide Her face distorts in pain followed
by confusion She brings the wood down turns to see first

EVE
Grace

then the HUNTING KNIFE in her hand then the blood on it
HER BLOOD And because none of these things are making sense
to Eve Grace offers

GRACE
I can’t go back

Eve just stares into Grace’s apologetic eyes

GRACE
He saved meI can’t go back to
being that weak girl

She steps forward PLUNGING the knife into Eve’s gut The
wood drops from Eve’s hand Grace takes her in a half
embrace Tears welling up in her eyes

GRACE
I just can’t

Eve coughs up blood Grace holds on for another beat her
eyes drifting down to John paralyzed on the ground There’s a
bit of fire in his eyes no doubt put there by Grace coming
to his rescue

She lets go of Eve now goes to him Eve collapses to the
floor Dead Grace takes John’s head into her hands

GRACE
Are you okay

She gently brushes his hair to the side

GRACE
I’m actually surprised to see you
too

(MORE )

GRACE (CONTD)
I thought youd be half way to
Europe chasing that rich girl by
now

O’ LEARY
I probably should be but

GRACE
But what

O’ LEARY
Someone might have seen the girl
with one of her college professors
and when I went by his sunflower
farm to ask some questions there
was just something --

GRACE
Are you talking about John

O’ LEARY
Yes Do you know him

Grace looks off like she knows something but doesn’t know
if she should say it

O’ LEARY
Grace what is it

GRACE
I think there’s something you
should see

EXT ROAD

O’Leary’s car pulls up behind the station wagon parked a
little ways from the gate to the fields They get out

O’ LEARY
What are we doing here

GRACE
One of Bobby’s friends used to
deliver fertilizer to John I
overheard him telling Bobby one
time that he saw John taking a girl
down into this cellar in the middle
of the sunflower fields

O’Leary’s shocked but he’s definitely believing the story

GRACE
I didn’t think anything of it
because all of Bobby’s friends are
liars but when you said you
suspected John

O’Leary’s eyes are already assessing the fields

GRACE
What if that girl is out there
right now Somewhere in the ground

Grace sounds absolutely petrified O’Leary turns back places
a comforting hand on her arm

O’ LEARY
I want you to stay here

GRACE
What are you going to do

O’ LEARY
I’m just going to look around I’11
be back in ten minutes okay

Grace nods unsure O’leary gives her a reassuring smile She
gives a half smile back She watches him move off with dread

He pulls his gun as he moves through the gate and ducks
quickly into the field The dread immediately leaves Grace
She smiles Looks up and down the road Yep they’re alone

INT SUNFLOWER FIELD

OLeary searches the field gun at the ready He moves
quickly scans scans and sees -- THE LATCH in the ground
He wraps his hand around it Does and sweep of the
surrounding area first then pulls the door open

INT JOHN’S UNDERGROUND WORK LAB
He takes one step at a time Gun raised It’s dark down here
but there’s a little light He stops at the bottom of the

stairs Raises his gun higher

O’ LEARY
Hello

He moves in further Tries to see with his eyes He’s only
getting glimpses of things and it’s making him more nervous

He comes to one of the hanging work lamps Reaches up and
clicks it on Now he sees JOHN CHAINED FACE DOWN on the bed
He’s dirty and bloodied Naked Unconscious There’s a LOW
GROAN across the room

RICK is strung up against the far wall His eyes flick back
and forth He’s paralyzed O’Leary can’t even really process
any of this because --

BAM

He’s hit over the back of the head He drops to his knees
His gun slides away He’s HIT again goes down completely
now He turns over Dazed Stares up at Grace and her BAT

GRACE
Eve’s dead I’m sorry about that

His eyes go wide as she raises the bat

GRACE
I really am

and brings it down
BLACK OUT
Out of the darknessa quiet whisper
GRACE (VO)

If you’re good Ill let you come
into the house

THE END
