FBI Agent SCOTT GARRIOLA a bear of a man enters the room
and moves with purpose to Deputy Sullivan

DEPUTY SULLIVAN

notified him it had been broken into

Agent Garriola likes that idea Deputy Sullivan goes taking
all others with him Joshs mind trying to process it all

CONNOLLY
Back in the neighborhood Ive been
making the rounds catching up with
old friends

Billy and Connolly locked into each other now

CONNOLLY (CONTD)

Connolly slides his phone number across the table Billy
doesnt take it

BILLY
Theres a natural order to things

Ive got to watch out for him Its
unnatural but I feel its necessary
Id like you to help me John Could
you help me do that Can you help me

Today we honor St Patrick for driving
the snakes from Ireland That Im

more impressive Saint Patrick fought
off the British and Romans Brutal
profiteers who regarded the Emerald
Isle as a place for loot and
decadence He feared nothing not
even death so complete was his faith
in his mission

Billy takes the mic out of the stand paces the stage

easily won for whats just

Cheers from the crowd

Today a new fight So a working man
can expect to live in a decent home

Constant cheers build to a steady ROAR

BILLY (CONTD)
We fight so our children and children
for generations to come can share
the Boston we hold so dearly in our
hearts We have an obligation to
those who fought before us an
obligation to Bostonians who can not
fight for themselves And perhaps
most importantly an obligation to
