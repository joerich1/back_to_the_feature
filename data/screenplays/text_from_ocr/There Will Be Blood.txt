ANGLE BEHIND THE MAN WITH THE PICK

DANIEL C PLAINVIEW (late 30’s here) is with pick and ax
in the middle of the day in 110 degree heat in New Mexico
searching for SILVER

He has a shaft about fifteen feet deep at this point
Nearby is a MULE and a CART He digs and digs and digs

The MULE is pulling a cart filled with his prospector’s
supplies He walks beside across the very rough desert
terrain HOLD

His MULE has dropped dead in the heat It is out like a light
turned over on it’s side the CART has fallen over with it

He walks over inspects wipes his sweat off takes a break for

CU DANIEL He sees something in the earth here

HIS POV — IN THE ROCK The clear tracing glistening vein of a
SLIVER ORE CHAMBER

HOLD ON HIS FACE AND THE CAMERA EXAMINES CLOSELY THESE MINERALS
IN THE ROCK PLAY OUT FULL

OUTSIDE THE SHAFT LATER
He unleashes the dead mule from the CART and begins to LOAD IN
MASSIVE CHUNKS OF ROCK LEADED WITH SILVER ORE INTO THE CART

He catches his breath He wipes his face and he goes back into
the SHAFT — but as he starts back down — somewhere between
passing out and tripping -- he plunges — loosing all his
balance twists around and HEADS FEET FIRST STRAIGHT DOWN THE
SHAFT WITH NO HOLD — AND LANDS AT THE BOTTOM —

BOTH HIS ANKLES SNAP TOWARDS EACH OTHER
HOLD He passes out

CU DANIEL
maybe a few moments later and he has come tohe looks up to the
top of SHAFT and sees the light —

Soover the course of however long it takes he pulls himself up
and out of the MINE SHAFT

ANGLE MOUTH OF THE SHAFT
he arrives at the openingHe puts himself on his back and
restsHOLD

As he opens his eyes he notices that the CART — from the weight
of SILVER ORE - it has tipped forwardand in doing so has
dropped his CANTEEN OF WATER that had been strapped safely to
the cart —

water dribbles out in a pool of mud where the canteen sits

OLD BABY Ailman’s son (HW)

They are again with pick and ax digging a well

They have a rope to a Horse and have connected the rope to
a pulley to raise and lower buckets into and out of the muck

They shovel the muddy dirt into buckets load the contents onto
a cart which they take by a MULE to another area and dump

This crew of men has erected a very CRUDE TWENTY FOOT TALL
DERRICK They have fashioned a drill by attaching a cross
shaped bit to a three inch rod They’ve got a pump driven
by horsepower

DANIEL operates the drill that’s essentially a 20ft eucalyptus
tree The large apparatus drives deep into the ground — the
first hit is very successful

He brings the drill back up for a second attempt

WIDE ANGLE
DANIEL drives the 300 pound apparatus down — it breaks loose
from his hands -- SLIPS COMPLETELY FROM HIS GRASP — AND PLUMMETS

CU DANIEL CALDECOT PLAINVIEW (DC PLAINVIEW) — 1908

A few (six) years later He is dressed well now slight show
of some wealth overcoat haircut clean shaven etc We see
nothing but him as he speaks

DANIEL
Ladies and Gentlemen I’ve traveled
over half our state to get here this
evening I couldn’t get away sooner because
my new well was coming in at Coyote Hills and
I had to see about it That well is now
flowing at two thousand barrels and it’s
paying me an income of five thousand dollars
a week I have two others drilling and I have
sixteen producing at Antelope
So — Ladies and Gentlemen — if I say I’m an
oil man you will agree

(beat )
You have a great chance here — but bear in
mind you can loose it all if you’re not
careful Out of all men that beg for a chance
to drill your lots maybe one in twenty will be
oil men the rest will be speculators — men
trying to get between you and the oil men — to
get some of the money that ought by rights come
to you Even if you find one that has money
and means to drill he’ll maybe know nothing
about drilling and he’ll have to hire out the
job on contract — and then you’re depending on
a contractor that’s tryin’ to rush the job
through — so he can get another contract just
as quick as he can This is way that this
works

An OC VOICE INTERRUPTS LOUDLY Daniel holds his composure

OC MALE VOICE
WHAT IS YOUR OFFER WERE WASTING TIME

DANIEL
I do my own drilling and the men that work
for me work for me and they are men I know
I make it my business to be there and see to
their work I don’t lose my tools in the hole
and spend months fishing for them I don’t
botch the cementing off and let water in the
hole and ruin the whole lease

REVEAL AT THAT MOMENT young HW (age 7) He is standing behind
Daniel and looking at the group OC Daniel and HW

DANIEL
I’m fixed like no other
company in this field and that’s
because my Coyote Hills well has just
come in — I have a string of tools
all ready to put to workI can load a rig
onto trucks and have them here in a week
I have business connections so I can get
the lumber for the derrick — such things go
by friendship in a rush like this
And this is why I can guarantee to start
drilling and put up the cash to back my word
I assure you whatever the others promise
to do when it comes to the showdown they
wont be there

REVERSE THE ROOM THAT MOMENT

About TEN FAMILIES have packed themselves into a very small
BUNGALOW HOME in Signal Hill near Long Beach Calif They are
a hungry group

MAN
THAT’S FINE THAT’S JUST FINE BUT HOW
DO YOU PROPOSE TO SPLIT UP THE LOTS

WOMAN
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING MR PLAINVIEW

MARRIED MAN
WE DON’T HAVE TIME FOR THIS IF YOU
CANT TELL US HOW YOU PLAN TO PAY
EACH AND EVERY PERSON THAT IS
IN THIS ROOM
ANOTHER MAN
LET HIM FINISH LET HIM FINISH

MAN
IF SOMEONE HAS A MARKED BOUNDARY AND
A SMALL LOT THAT INFRINGES —

ANOTHER MAN
LET HIM FINISH

MAN
INFRINGING ON MY LOT AND TAKING MY MONEY

ANOTHER MAN
LET HIM FINISH Please Mr Plainview --

DANIEL
It’s not up to me to say how you’re going
to divide the royalty But let me say this
whatever you give up so you can get together —
it will be smart compared to what you may loose
by delay The crooks and the gamblers are near
and the wolf is scratching the door
Ladies and Gentlemen take it from
me aS an oil man — humbly — there aren’t going
to be many gushers here at Signal Hill
A field plays out very quick In two or three
years these wells will be dry — even this
discovery well that’s gushing down the road and
has everyone so crazy So my suggestion with
respect is take a smaller share of royalty
and we will see that it’s a small
share of a bigger royalty That
ladies and gentleman is what I had to say

HOLD ON THE ROOM Everyone has taken this in then THE ROOM
ERUPTS AS EACH FAMILY SCREAMS AND YELLS AND UNLEASHES THEIR
WRATH AT EACH OTHER ABOUT HOW THEIR LOTS SHOULD BE DIVIDED AND
ROYALTIES SHARED AND MEASURMENTS OF “SMALL LOTS” “BIG LOTS”
“LITTLE BIG LOTS” “LITTLE SMALL LOTS” WOMEN SCREAM “WE SHOULD
JUST GO WITH A FAMILY OPERATION IT’S MORE IMPORTANT” A MAN
SCREAMS “BULL”

We witness human dignity go completely out the window

Daniel stands slowly turns and walks out the door without even
being noticed HW walks out behind Daniel

CUT TO

EXT SIGNAL HILL — THAT MOMENT

CAMERA leads DANIEL and HW out of the bungalow and onto the
street they are followed out of the house by a small man named
PRESCOTT (50s) pleading his case —

PRESCOTT

DANIEL
I don’t need the lease thank you

PRESCOTT
But no no we need you wed like
for you to begin —

DANIEL
There’s too much confusion Thank
you for your time

PRESCOTT
No confusion let us just please come
back and we can all settle this —

DANIEL
I wouldn’t take the lease if you gave
it to me as a gift

INT BANKSIDE HOME -— NIGHT

DANIEL is now sitting with a nice mild mannered man JIM
BANKSIDE (50s) his WIFE sits with him and their TWO SONS aged 10
and 12 HW sits beside Daniel and a bit behind

DANIEL
Mr Bankside I’m not going to waste
your time and Id like it if you didn’t
waste mine If you want to sign with
me we can have a well drilling within
ten days Your lot is further North from
the discovery well up here so it means we
will probably have to dig deeper If theres
as much oil up here as I think there is it
will be harder to reach but once we find it
we can take it right out But we have to
act quickly because very soon these grounds
will dry up I need you to know what you
want to do Because of the distance
from the discovery well Ill pay you a smaller
royalty than you’d get down there — but I’1ll
give you a thousand dollar bonus on your lot

BANKSIDE
what royalty

DANIEL
A sixth — now that’s standard
And a guarantee to start
drilling within ten days — which isn’t

in the usual way and on top of that you can
have five percent from me And that’1l
be what makes you a man You seem aware enough

said to me once (mimics voice)
“But I Don’t Believe In Atonement
Through Blood It Doesn’t Come Up
To My Ideas Of What Is Right”
I SAID “TO HELL WITH YOUR IDEAS OF
WHAT IS RIGHT DO YOU THINK GOD IS COMING

Joe Ghunda was a deeply faithful
man and I was hoping you might
speak at his burial

ELI
«Daniel This accident could have
been avoided It’s terrible to think
of that drilling well working
away up there unblessed —

DANIEL
Yes it could have These men work
in twelve hour shifts and they need
their rest If they don’t have it they
make stupid mistakes

ELI
I’ve seen some of the men drinking
alcohol — do you think that has something
to do with it

BEAT

DANIEL
We need these men rested to bring
this well in — some of them can’t
get it if they’re coming here for
your gospel — and then the well can’t
produce and blow gold all over the place

ELI
«I wish Id had more time with
Joe Ghundamore could have been done

DANIEL
Wed be honored to have you speak at
his burial tomorrow We can do it at
noon if that’s alright with you

ELI
That would be fine

DANIEL

Holy Spirit that we’d be needing more room

some of this misfortune might pass

Silence

joined Eli down at the Church of
The Third Revelation — I know you
haven’t had the time — but I know
that to lead a full life — you must make
the time I know that if Eli were allowed
to perform a blessing on this well
that it would bear fruit and you
wouldn’t have to go fishingbut you need
to not be a backslider Daniel
you’re on a very bad path

DANIEL
am I

you don’t like the way I raise my
children and guide my family — but

It’s the truth - you’re not my son
and you never have beenyou’re an orphan

I should have known that under this all
these past years youve been building your
hate for me piece by pieceand I don’t
even know who you arebecause you have none
of me in youYoure Someone Else’s

William Bandy is one of the
finest members we have in the Church
of the Third Revelation

good charismatic ability and he is
headed for wonderful things
He is eager to come to Hollywood
to be in movies He is very good looking
And I do think he will have success
