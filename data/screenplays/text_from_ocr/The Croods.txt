FADE IN

A cave painting of the Dreamworks logo Push past the
moon to the sun Bright Beautiful The sun DISSOLVES
TO

Cave paintings of a family of cavemen -- we will come to
know them as The Croods

EEP (VO)
With every sun comes a new day A new
beginning A hope that things will be
better today than they were yesterday

The Croods scurry out of their cave like mice looking for
food Scared Fast

The Croods are chased by beasts across the desert They
escape from creatures up trees They hide behind rocks

EEP (VO)
But not for me My names Eep This is
my family the Croods If you werent
clued in already by the animal skins and
sloping foreheads - were cavemen Most
days we spend in our cave in the dark
Night after night day after day Yep
Home sweet home When we did go out we
struggled to find food in a harsh and
hostile world And I struggled to
survive my family
The Croods are chased by beasts across the desert They
escape from creatures up trees They hide behind rocks

EEP (VO)
We were the last ones around There used
to be neighbors The Gorts smashed by a
mammoth The Horks swallowed by a sand
snake The Erfs mosquito bite Throgs
common cold And the Croods Thats
us The Croods made it

Grug protects his family from a GIANT BEAR OWL

EEP (VO)
Because of my Dad He was strong and
he followed the rules

A shadow falls across their feet and Grug ushers his
family home

EEP (VO)
the ones painted on the cave walls
Anything new is bad curiosity is bad
going out at night is bad Basically
anything fun is bad Welcome to my
world

They all run back into the cave where Grug slams the rock
door closed

SLOWLY LIGHT ON CAVE PAINTINGS COMES UP AGAIN But this
time the light casts an ominous tone

EEP (VO)
But this is a story about how all that
changed in an instant

RAPID SHOTS OF THE GREAT SPLIT CUTTING THROUGH THE LAND
HEADED TOWARDS CROOD VALLEY

SHOTS OF CATACLYSM CUT FASTER AND FASTER UNTIL

EEP (VO)
Because what we didnt know was that our
world was about to come to an end And
there were no rules on our cave walls to
prepare us for that

CAVEMAN HANDS PRESS against the rock wall They PUSH A
BLINDING LIGHT FLOODS the screen

SEQ 100 - MEET THE CROODS

A HUGE CAVEMAN GRUG RUSHES forward screaming
growling and throwing handfuls of dirt in a THREAT
DISPLAY He BLINKS in the bright morning light He
LIFTS and HURLS a large boulder

GRUG
Raaaaar groooo0000cc0owwwll ERF ERF
Glaaaaaabbbb11111111thhhh

As suddenly as he began Grug stops Panting he waits
for the echoes of his outburst to fade

Grug TURNS to the cave entrance he prepares to BELLOW a
signal but before any sound escapes his lips--

A CAVE GIRL EEP bursts from the cave

GRUG (CONTD)
Youre supposed to wait for my signal
Eep Eep

Eep scares a pack of nearby Liyotes away They pounce on
Grug briefly before scampering off Eep spreads out on
an overhanging rock She BASKS IN THE SUN

EEP
Weve been in that cave forever

GRUG
Three days is not forever

EEP
It is with this family

GRUG
Eep would you come down here Youre
being so dramatic

A LITTLE GIRL SANDY charges out next Her display is
more terrier-like

GRUG (CONTD)
No no no Sandy come back here
Remember the signal Good girls wait for
the signal

A CAVE WOMAN UGGA scrambles out next She is mostly
focused on catching Sandy giving only cursory effort to
her display

GRUG (CONTD)
Ugga

UGGA
As soon as I get Sandy Ill go back in
and you can give the signal

GRUG
No I mean youre already out now

THUNK (0S)
I am waiting for the signal dad

We HEAR the voice of Grugs nine-year-old son from inside
the cave THUNK is eager to please his dad and emulates
his every move

GRUG

Never mind Thunk Just come out

THUNK
(not so fast)
Uhh but if you dont give the signal
how do I know youre my dad

GRUG
The signal isnt so you know its me
its so you know I wasnt eaten by an
animal

Beat
THUNK

Then why is the signal an animal noise
I mean doesnt that just confuse things

Grug sighs
THUNK (CONTD)
I dont know Im still waiting for the
signal

GRUG
Sigh Hoo hooooco Hoo hooooo
Thunk comes out growling and barrels into Grug Thunk

picks up a boulder and throws it It ricochets off the

cliff wall and careens into Grug Grug gets plowed over
by the boulder

UGGA

Mom were ready to leave
(BEAT)

Mom

Grug sits up and smiles
GRAN
Still alive

Grugs face drops

GRUG
Its still early

GRAN
And youre still fat

GRUG
Breakfast formation

The Croods form up in a flying wedge with Grug in the
lead

GRUG (CONTD)
I want to see some real caveman action
out there We do this fast We do this
loud we do this as a family and never
not be afraid Go

THUNK
YAY BREAKFAST

COMPRESSED TIME - The Croods RUN out of Crood canyon
across the wide expanses of desert

SEQ 150 - SMASH and GRAB
EXT MOUTH OF CROOD CANYON - MORNING

Grug and the Croods come to a stop at the HUNTING
GROUNDS They are spent from a fifteen-mile run
THUNK
(HUFFING)
Yeah breakfast

We see a nest with a huge unguarded blue egg The Croods
take shelter behind a rock Grug PEERS over the top

GRUG
Whos up

Eeps hand SHOOTS up Thunk is less than enthusiastic

GRUG (CONTD)
Well flip for it

Grug LIFTS Gran on his hand and FLIPS her up in the air

GRUG (CONTD)
Call her in the air

EEP
Heads

Gran FACE-PLANTS her head buried in the sand Only her
tail is showing

GRUG
Tails Thunks in

GRUG (CONTD)

Positions

The family fades back and splits up They get into
fightingrunning position

GRUG (CONTD)
Ok Thunk Go Come on Thunk

Thunk BREAKS COVER He dashes into the open SNATCHES
the egg

GRUG (CONTD)
Hah Way to go Take it to the cave

Thunk PASSES Grug and makes a bee-line for Crood Canyon
A Gerf bird smashes Thunk and steals the egg back

GRUG (CONTD)
Oooh

GRUG (CONTD)
Release the baby

Eep and Sandy MOVE IN on the bird Sandy NIPS at its
heels while UGGA CLIMBS up onto its head She PULLS the
egg from its beak

Down range TRIP GERBILS SURFACE They STRETCH their
shared tail across the Ramus path like an arresting
cable on a carrier

Ugga RISES to THROW the egg to Grug - the gerbils WRAP
their tail around the Ramu like a bola The Ramu GOES
DOWN hard Ugga and the egg ROLL forward The Trip
Gerbils SNATCH up the egg and make off with it

UGGA
Get um Mom Do it for the Croods

Grans cane HOOKS the gerbils in the middle of their tail
and WHIPS them up and over her shoulder

ON GRAN

DRIBBLING the egg down-range with her cane like a hockey
player LIYOTES POP UP from behind hoodoos They SWARM
in behind her

The Liyotes TRIP Gran They steal the egg and HIT THE
GAS They are INCREDIBLY FAST

GRAN

Old lady down Eep avenge me

ON EEP

Crouched in the shade of a scrubby bush like a runner on
the blocks - she has the Liyotes in her sights Eep
LAUNCHES

Eep runs after the Liyote with the egg cutting him off
in his tracks he slams into a cactus launching the egg
into the air Eep leaps into the air taking back the egg

EEP
Thanks

A bunch of Jackrobats see Eep and swarm around her She
loses her footing and throws the egg to Grug

GRUG
Eep

EEP
Heads Up

Grug catches the egg and runs by the entrance of a small
cave Thunk following close behind accidentally trips
over the tail of a sleeping Bear Owl knocking Grug to the
ground and fumbling the egg once again

Thunk catches the egg just as the Girelephant bears down
on him from behind and lifts him onto one of its tusks

The family members meet up as they begin their long run

back to the cave

An entire swarm of animals chase the Croods as they head
back to their cave

The Bear Owl is awakened and goes after everyone on the
chase

Grug protecting his family from the BearOwl tosses each
family member onto the Girelephants back

Grug dodges the BearOwls attack and uses him as a
launching pad to get himself safely on the Girelephant

Thunk is happy to see Dad is safe

THUNK
Oh hey Dad can we eat now

GRUG
Just wait till we get home Eep put on
the brakes

The entrance to Crood canyon appears on the horizon

Eep hangs off the edge of one of its tusks as Grug takes
over the other Together they dig their heels into the
ground slowing down the Girelephant

The Bearowl continues the chase The Croods maneuver the
Girelephant to fend off the Bearowl

GRUG (CONTD)
Eep
The Girelephant moving way too fast readies for the
crash The Girelephant crashes into the entrance of the
canyon sending the Croods flying in They all tumble
Grug makes an extraordinary football catch He holds
tight to the meal as he slams into a rock Grug holds up
the egg

GRUG (CONTD)
Whos hungry

THUNK
Alright Good one dad

GRUG
Here you go Thunk Drink up

Grug tosses the egg to Thunk Thunk fumbles it and it
cracks open

THUNK
Sorry dad

UGGA
Looks like fast food tonight

The family passes the leaky egg around quickly each
Crood gets a taste Thunk is the last Crood to get a
mouthful he hands it over to Grug-- the egg is empty

GRUG
Thats alright I ate last week

A SHADOW TOUCHES Grugs feet He looks up - the sun is
setting behind the canyon wall He HOLDS UP his hand to
gauge how much daylight is left

GRAN
Two knuckle warning

UGGA
Come on Croods Go go go

Crood cave She RAISES HER HAND to â€˜catch a few more
moments of sun

EEP

GRUG
How can she not like the cave Its so
cozy

UGGA

Grug is finished with his bath

GRUG (CONTD)
(LOSING PATIENCE)
Eep Eep

Eep begins to climb down the wall outside when she hears
a sound in the distance Curious she begins to climb
even higher Grug leaves the cave searching for her

GRUG (CONTD)
Come on I gotta close the cave

ON GRUG exiting the cave Grug sees that Eep is at the
very top

GRUG (CONTD)
Eep

Eep continues to climb
EEP

Okay okay

GRUG
Come on

Behind Grug the Bear Owl appears up the canyon It
SPOTS Grug and the open cave and RACES to attack Grug
sees the BearOwl in full attack mode

GRUG (CONTD)
EEP COME DOWN

Grug throws a rock which momentarily stuns the creature
allowing Eep to JUMP DOWN and DART into the cave Grug
barely gets the cave closed in time

SEQ 210 - BEDTIME STORY

The Bear Owl PUSHES his paw through the narrow opening
and FEELS around for the Croods The Croods are like
mice in this world

GRUG
That was too close

EEP
I was watching I was fine

GRUG
What were you doing up there Eep

EEP

GRUG

Nothing

GRUG
Well then why did you go up there

EEP

(ANNOYED)
I dont know

GRUG
Why dont you know Stop looking for
things Fear keeps us alive Eep Never
not be afraid

Eep climbs up on a ledge and curls up in the corner where
a tiny spot of light seeps in

EEP
(TO HERSELF)
Whats the point of all this

GRUG
Hmmm What was that

EEP
(a little louder)
I mean why are we here
doing this for

CROODS
GROAN

GRUG

Grug brightens

GRUG

(BRIGHTENING)
Thats a good idea How about a story

THUNK

Oh yeah tell us a story

The Croods minus Eep gather in a semi-circle on the
ground Grug retrieves Sandy and her Krispy Bear from
the bone-crib

GRUG
Ok Can I borrow that Thank you Eep
Your old favorite

EEP
I havent played with that thing in
years

GRUG
Tonight well hear the story of Krispy
Bear

Grug sits and waits a beat for Eep to join but she stays
put

As Grug talks he gestures at a rough sketch on the wall
of the cave

GRUG (CONTD)
A long time ago this little bear was
alive She was alive because she
listened to her father and lived her life
in routine and darkness and terror So
she was happy But Krispy had one
terrible problem She was filled with
curiosity
UGGA
Grug

Ugga covers Sandys ears

GRUG
Yes And one day while she was ina
tree the curious little bear wanted to
climb to the top

THUNK
Wha

GRUG
And no sooner than she climbed to the
top she saw something new and died

Grug SWATS the painting

THUNK
Just like that

GRUG
Yes Her last moments of terror still
frozen on her face

Grug holds out Krispy Bear The family is terrified

GRAN
Oh same ending as everyday

THUNK

(FREAKED OUT)
I get it dad I get it I will never
do anything new or different

GRUG
Good man Thunk

Pan across the walls to reveal they are covered with
stories all seemingly with the same ending
UGGA
Alright everyone sharpen your teeth and
lets pile up

All their worst fears confirmed the Croods snuggle into
one big heap warm and comfy Grug casts a glance to

Eeps ledge She doesnt budge

FADE TO BLACK
SEQ 500 - FOLLOW THE LIGHT

INT CROOD CAVE - NIGHT

The Croods sleep peacefully in their pile Except Eep
who tosses restlessly on her LEDGE Outside we hear the
ROARS and HOWLS of prehistoric creatures fighting

But then SILENCE

And then cutting through the primordial night is a
MUSICAL SOUND Unsettling Unearthly Eep creeps

around her sleeping family and cautiously approaches the
door to peer outside when suddenly--

WHOOSH A bright light blazes through the gaps around
the boulder door bathing Eep in an OTHER-WORLDLY GLOW
She chases the flash of light around the cave trying to
catch it in her hands

Eep presses her face against the cold boulder trying to
get a look at what is outside but she cant get more
than a blurred glimpse of the canyon beyond - and the
disappearing light

Desperate to see more Eep braces her back against the
cave and PUSHES the plug rock with her legs Slowly she
shifts the rock careful not to wake her father It takes
all of her strength but she manages to move it just
enough for her to BARELY SQUEEZE out

EXT CROOD CANYON - CONTINUOUS

Eep stands outside at night for the first time ever Her
heart races The hot night wind blows against her face
and through her hair The forbidden sensation is
exhilarating

The canyon beyond is quickly swallowing the light - it
will be gone in another few seconds With one of her
hands pressed tightly to the cave â€˜door she steels
herself

Eep LETS GO and DASHES after the light SCRAMBLING
through the SANDSTONE NARROWS bounding from side to
side As she disappears into the darkness of the canyon

EXT CANYON

The light ahead is growing brighter Eep is closing on
it In her excitement she missteps and SNAPS a stick
underfoot

It was barely audible Eep instinctively FREEZES

A huge SHADOW of a TUSKED CREATURE is cast on the wall
above her Eep throws a rock at the shadow

She POWERS STRAIGHT UP the stone wall with unexpected
speed

The Creature RUNS Eep tops the wall and

EXT ROCK ARCH - NIGHT

Eep steps into a small clearing Stuck in the ground is
a TORCH As far as Eep knows this is the thing she was
following Eep crouches down and cautiously approaches

REVERSE ANGLE - Eep can feel the heat from the fire on
the palms of her hands and her face TENSE EXCITING

But camouflaged against the rock wall behind her
something MOVES A WARTHOG CREATURE stands upright and
creeps up behind her

Eep reaches out to TOUCH the flame The torch blows away
from her The wind has changed direction The breeze at
her back Eep smells the Creature behind her On her
face awe turns to determination as she wheels and grabs
the creature She THROWS and FLIPS it over her shoulder
It hits the torch knocking it to the ground Eep jumps
back GRABBING a good-sized rock - shes poised to bash
the Creatures brains in

CREATURE
Nuh Nuh

The Creature defensively raises its arms hands in front
of its face

Eep throws a tantrum of epic proportion She SLAMS a
rock on the ground It SHATTERS to dust

Then a small amount of sand falls from up above A crack
starts to splinter under their feet

EEP (CONTD)
He said this would happen

Then BOOM The ground starts to SHAKE

Get to the cave GO

The Croods RACE through the CANYON NARROWS fighting
their way through falling boulders and shifting ground
heading towards the safety of their cave

The Croods see the cave entrance The canyon walls above
their home start to crack Grug sees that the falling
rock will crush the cave

GRUG (CONTD)
Look out Stop

Grug leaps and tackles his family protecting them from
the mass of rocks crashing down

The top of the canyon collapses and the Croods cave is
destroyed Everything is engulfed by dust The earth
settles

DISSOLVE TO
SEQ 710 - CROSSING OVER

The dust clears a bit - the Croods are in a tight ball
covered by Grug Grug stands all Croods were sheltered
and safe under his mighty arms

GRUG (CONTD)
Is everyone okay

UGGA

Yes Grug the cave its gone

Grug looks back to Crood cave It is gone

GRUG
No

Grug searches the rubble for any sign that the cave might
still be there He finds one handprint split in two
He carefully fits them back together Emotional he
lowers his head

As Eep steps forward a shaft of light filtering through
the dusty veil from the wreckage crosses her face--

As the dust descends Eep sees A NEW WORLD beyond

EEP
You really need to see this

The dumbfounded Croods stare in awe at the beautiful
world

The Croods look out at the new world

EEP (CONTD)
We should go there

GRUG
No No one is going anywhere

Grug pulls Eep back from the precipice

GRUG (CONTD)
What else did that boy say

WHOOSH Suddenly bursting from the New World is a giant
flying creature - a TURTLE DOVE

The Croods reel back as it sails overhead They turn to
watch the Turtle Dove as it flies away

They hear a familiar menacing growl Its the BEAR OWL
It roars and charges toward the Croods

Grug instinctively GRABS a giant boulder and rolls it in
front of his family

The Bear Owl runs and swats the massive boulder away like
a ball of yarn

But the Croods are not behind it They are running

It looks at the Croods with delight Suddenly the
shadow of the setting sky passes over the Macawnivore
It freaks out and retreats into the forest

THUNK
Hah Its scared of the dark wait

And for good reason because as the SHADOW from the
setting sun falls across the Croods

Suddenly thousands of PIRANHA OWLS BURST from the
grasses around the Croods and form a huge undulating
cloud above them Its a beautiful sight

The cloud of Piranha Owls then SETTLE on a massive LAND
WHALE

Moments later they fly back into the air - the whale is
SKELETONIZED It CRUMPLES to the ground

Eep breaks a horn from the skull and BLOWS on it loud and
long

ON GUY hearing the horn He is happy to hear the sound
knowing its Eep calling him

Then as Guy begins walking towards the sound Guy notices
the circling birds in the sky Alarmed he DASHES off

Guy appears at the treeline He spots Eep standing alone
in the clearing He sees the birds heading towards her
He runs and leaps off a ROCK OUTCROPPING jumping right
over the CROODS who are huddled near the ROCK

Guy lands and in one fluid motion knocking the horn out
of Eeps hand to stop the noise then STRIKES a spark with
two STONES The birds close in blotting out the
remaining light All goes BLACK

Then a tiny leaf of flame FLUTTERS to life before Guy
He THROWS two more handfuls of grass on it and it FLARES
UP The light SPLITS the onrushing red tide of birds

like a knife For a few moments the Croods are inside a
TORNADO of the tiny monsters The mass PASSES

Grug SLAPS at one last smoldering bird FLUTTERING past

Grug TURNS to see Guy HOLDING his daughter Grugs
expression DARKENS He SNARLS

you could fall

Grug cringes and bellows with every step Guy still
locked inside the log hops away as fast as he can Grug
leaps out and grabs the log only to loosen it as Guy
jumps to a coral patch below

GUY

Guy now free runs and hides behind a giant shell He
looks back at the Croods as they try in vain to cross the
field and feels pity for Eep

THUNK
Ow Jumping doesnt help I mean just
briefly but it doesnt get better Ow
Do not walk on your hands the hands do

Guy looks back at the stranded Croods Then he looks
again to the tall mountain Belt sees that Guy is having
a hard time leaving the Croods He needs to make a
choice Belt makes it for him

The Croods run slowly at first then faster And
faster The shoes make the difference

ON THE CROODS

Grug encounters a bunch of Punch Monkeys again He
readies himself for a fight

Guy hands out bananas
Grug throws his banana to the ground only to slip on it
ON THE CROODS

Grug sees the Macawnivore down below in the crevasse
waiting for his Croods dinner

Grug sees Guy making something out of sticks

Traveling by stilts over a crevasse
The family hobbles across a canyon on their stilts Guy
helps Eep from falling

EEP
So Howd the tiger fly
GUY
He jumped on the sun and rode it to

tomorrow
Grug doesnt like seeing his daughter so close to Guy

GRUG
No no no
The family moves across Grug is the last to follow

Grug spies Chunky the Death Cat below him Grug WHACKS
Chunky in the face with a stilt

Chunky ponders the strange sticks Grug is perched on
then WHACKS a chunk out of them Grug DROPS down by a
yard or so Panicking Grug RACES across the chasm
losing stilt height with every SWIPE of Chunkys paw
Grug doesnt make it across - SNARLING and BITING sounds
emanate from the canyon

GRUG (CONTD)
Ooowwwww

The Croods stand at the top of a cliff

Grug tries to maneuver his way down the cliff by clinging
to the side

Guy and the other Croods sit on a giant leaves sledding
down the side of the canyon past Grug

They pass Grug up as he continues to make his way down by
tiptoeing Grug stumbles and falls down the slope

THUNK
Hi dad Bye dad

BOOM A FLASH POPS against the Croods SWING THE CAMERA
AROUND to reveal A HUGE STORM hanging like a purple

curtain before them The Croods stop dead

The rain line BEARS DOWN on them
Grug tries to PUNCH the drops
ON EEP AND GUY

GUY
Youve seen rain before right

EEP
We dont get out much

Guy opens an Umbrella to cover himself from the rain
Belt pulls Eep under the umbrella to be close to Guy

BELT
Hmmmmm
Belt makes an Origami boat He and Sandy sail across the
rain puddles

Grug seeing Guy and Eep snuggling under the umbrella
grabs the umbrella away from Guy Grug gets hit by
lightning

The rest of the Croods open their umbrellas to take cover
as they enjoy the RAIN

ON THE CROODS UNDULATING REFLECTION

The Croods stand on a tiny island in a shallow ocean -
Eep is pointing at her own reflection

GRUG
(FRUSTRATED)
Eep looks dangerous

EEP

Oh dad you say that about everything
Eep goes to jump in the water Guy STOPS her

GUY
Careful

EEP
Oh really Okay

Guy CANNONBALLS Then SURFACES

Eep tentatively HOPS in Guy STEADIES her Then shows
her how to move her arms in a swimming motion
Guy SUPPORTS Eep by holding one hand under her tummy
She begins to SWIM

Gran and Ugga SMILE mischievously - a positive vibe is
building

The Croods ALL JUMP at once

Grug is left alone Belt uses Grugs arm as a diving
platform Gran Sandy and Belt are doing synchronized
swimming Then Grug sees Eep and Guy SURFACE - Eep is on
Guys shoulders This is too much for Grug

GRUG
Augh No no no Not cool Not cool
Not cool

Grug DIVES IN to put a stop to any potential shenanigans

Grugs huge tidal wave SWAMPS Guy and Eep Grug SINKS to
the bottom

ON GRUG laying on the bottom His family SWIMS above him
on the tails of Fishcats confident and free and buoyant

A lone bubble escapes Grugs nose like oil oozing from a
sunken wreck Hes feeling mighty extraneous

Grug sees the Macawnivore swimming towards him Grug
swims for his life Ends in a big splash

EXT TUFA MAZE - AFTERNOON

The Croods stand motionless before an open plain deeply
sculpted with meandering grooves which form a massive
MAZE

Guy is handing out SHELLS to the Croods

GUY
Here you go one for you and this ones
for you

THUNK

Grug is annoyed by everyone blowing their shells

GRUG
Okay Okay Thats enough I dont see
why the kids need their own shells

GUY
So if anyone gets in trouble we can call
the others

GRUG

Wait-- youre saying we should split up

GUY
We can try more paths at once Its the

GRUG
No no no no no Its my job to keep you
safe Im still in charge and we are not

(seeing Eep and Guy together)
Except for you two And thats final

Grug SITS down like a silverback gorilla

Just then A HUGE RUMBLE The EARTH STARTS TO SHAKE
VIOLENTLY The Croods and Guy are KNOCKED DOWN into the
Maze each â€˜falling into a separate entrance

They disappear into the rift like a penny dropped down a
drain

As Grug and Guy slide passed each other Frustrated Grug
tries to punch Guy

GUY
Oh hello

INSIDE THE MAZE
The SHAKING COMES TO A STOP Everyone (now separated)
gathers themselves

ON GRUG-- finding himself alone

GRUG

Thunk PICKS UP his shell and tentatively makes his way
alone into his branch of the maze

ON EEP (OR GUY)-- in another part of the maze She puts
her hand on the giant wall to her LEFT

PULL BACK and see that they are actually in parallel
â€œchannels but with the huge wall between them

ON Gran and Ugga - encountering carnivorous flowers
ON Thunk - encountering a croco-pup

ON Eep - finding a flower dropped on her path

ON Grug - reaching a fork

Ugga and Gran don flowery camouflage

Thunk THROWS his shell at the Crocopup MISSES To his
surprise the Crocopup returns the shell

Thunk plays fetch with this portly beast which shows him
the way through the maze

Eep PICKS UP the flower puts it in her hair then finds
a more flowers dropped on her path She playfully begins
hunting for Guy

Guy and Belt are secretly and playfully tossing flowers
in Eeps path

Grug POPS out of a passageway - hes back where he began
He chooses another tunnel

Ugga and Gran pass unharmed through the flower grove -
the colors and smells are overpoweringly vibrant

Eep surprises Guy and Belt in their hideaway as the two
of them continue to throw flowers over the edge and onto
Eeps path

EEP
You dropped these

Guy slips and falls onto a huge lilypad He smiles up at
Eep

They share a moment before Eep shyly vanishes again

Grug finds himself back at the entrance of the maze He
grumbles and enters a different tunnel

ON THE MAZE EXIT -

Guy appears at the exit and puts his hand up to the
setting sun that kisses the top of the mountain Guy is
amazed that he and Eep are both doing the same thing He
is smitten Guy goes over to Eep

Guy takes her hand
GUY
Come with me

Eep and Guy turn to each other just as Thunk emerges and
tosses a rock for the Croco-Pup to fetch

bringing Grug and Guy along with it
Grug and Guy hang on to the bones of the puppet frame

ethereal image created by a perfect alignment of sun
clouds and mountain From the Croods POV it looks as if
they can cross a solid bridge of clouds and climb onto a
waiting sun

There it is The sun We can do it We
can ride it to Tomorrow

Tremors violently SHAKE the ground

When the rift OPENS in front of them the hot gasses and
blasts of hot ash BURST the clouds from beneath The
debris shades the sun revealing a very Earthly landscape
beyond

From the Croods perspective Tomorrow vanished before
their eyes

A SHOCKWAVE knocks a large chunk of rock off the edge the
Croods are standing on blowing them backwards

I

need to fix everything and I dont have
time

GRUG
I can fix it

Grug embraces Eep

EEP
This works good What do you call it

GRUG
I was thinking of calling it a Hug
(clears his throat)
(MORE)

GRUG (CONTD)
Because it rhymes with Grug But you can
change it if you want

EEP
No I like a Hug

A BEAT

GRUG
I love you

Eep takes in the full effect of her dads words

EEP
I

The ground begins to shake and break apart around them

EEP (CONTD)
Dad Im scared

GRUG
Never be afraid

The gap grows wider Grug lifts Eep and makes the
greatest throw of his life

The tumult parts briefly Grug can see his entire family
safe on the other side He waves a last goodbye To his
surprise a shaft of sunlight has settled on his open
hand

GUY
There I see him

The family waves to Grug to let him know they are okay

SEQ 2750 - FAMILY PORTRAIT

EXT CLIFFSIDE

Grug is startled by another earthquake The ground is
ripping itself apart as meteors begin to fall around him
Grug dodges falling debris and lighting and manages to

crawl into a nearby cave-- a familiar place for him

INT CAVE

Grug grabs two pieces of flint and starts clicking them
together just as Guy did earlier They ignite Grug
has created his very first fire

GRUG
(PLEASED)
Hey I did it

Another earthquake shakes the cavern Grug moves over to
a wall and uses some nearby mud to paint a portrait of
his family He paints each member individually and then
looks longingly at the family he will never see again

The torch begins to go out Grug blows on it and is
startled by the massive Macawnivore beast growling at
him

GRUG (CONTD)
Ahhhh Back Stay back Stay back

The Macawnivore blows out the torch Another meteor hits
the cave with a loud boom The Macawnivore stops growling
and starts blowing on the torch along with Grug It is
just as frightened as Grug Grug reaches out and pets

the now gentle carnivorous beast

INT CAVE

Grug and the Macawnivore huddle together in a prehistoric
armistice When suddenly Grug hears the dim tone of
Eeps shell signal He rushes to the entrance to the
cave He surveys the raging CATACLYSM outside the cave

as the world is being torn asunder
He hears the SHELL ALARM blow TWO MORE TIMES His family
is in trouble

GRUG
Theyre in trouble Hang on Im
coming
The scale of his problem sinks in
GRUG (CONTD)
How do I get across Gotta think What
would Guy do What would Guy do
Something occurs to Grug

GRUG (CONTD)
What would I do

He absent-mindedly hands the torch to the Macawnivore

GRUG (CONTD)
Hold this

Grug CLOSES HIS EYES and CONCENTRATES
The ember of a thought FLICKERS TO LIFE in Grugs brain

GRUG (CONTD)

I have an IDEA
MACAWNIVORE
Erm
CUT TO

SEQ 2975 - GRUG CROSSES THE DIVIDE

EXT FIELD

Grug uses a log to wipe tar all over a giant rib cage
Grug runs out of the cave and into a nearby field and
startles a pack of nesting PIRANHA OWLS He turns back
to the Macawnivore

The meat-eating birds begin to chase Grug

GRUG
Run
Grug leaps onto the Macawnivores back as the birds move
in closer The ground begins to break up violently as
lakes empty themselves and entire forests turn sideways

The Macawnivore rushes into a giant rib cage that Grug
has coated with tar The Piranha Owls hit the rib cage
and stick to it As they fight to free themselves the
rib cage lifts off the ground Grug takes a giant tree
branch ignites it and uses it as a rudder scaring the
Piranha Owls and prompting them to fly in one coherent
direction

GRUG (CONTD)
Yes

As the cage flies above the fiery landscape Grug sees
Douglas sitting forlornly with the shell still in his
mouth

GRUG (CONTD)
Douglas

Grug doesnt even debate it he runs back for the little
monstrosity

GRUG (CONTD)
Hey I know that guy

Grug JUMPS out of the cage and rushes over to grab the
gerbils Then Grug notices a familiar Liyote hiding
under a nearby rock He GRABS the Liyote Grug sees the
TRIP-GERBILS stranded as well Grug TWIRLS the Trip-
Gerbils around his neck like a scarf

GRUG (CONTD)
Get up

A ROAR BUILDS behind Grug - the pyroclastic flow is
SPEEDING closer

Grug CATCHES UP to the lumbering blimp-cage He PUSHES
it to go faster

GRUG (CONTD)
Hold on

The pyroclastic cloud BLASTS up the narrow passage
Finally with Grugs strength the cage CLEARS the edge
of the cliff
The CLOUD HITS them all SWALLOWING the Cage like a
speck

SEQ 3500 - EPILOGUE

RUSHING TOWARD A SHORELINE covered in dense palms gentle
waves lapping at the sand

On Eep fixing her hair We PULL OUT to see the whole
family preparing for a family photo

my family The Croods If you werent

the face leaving the first family photo

hostile But now we know the Croods will
make it

drink to Gran PULL OUT to reveal she is in a sled
hitched to a team of Liyotes The liyotes are tending to
her Gran sips her drink

EEP (CONTD)
Because we changed the rules The ones
that kept us in the dark

On Ugga sharpening a spear The Macawnivore comes in to
frame with Grug riding on top Ugga tosses him the spear
Eep flips from out of the trees She blows her horn to
call Guy and the BearOwl for a ride

EEP (CONTD)
And because of my dad who taught us that
anyone can change

The Macawnivore LEAPS through the trees onto a broad
beautiful beach with Grug and Ugga atop

GRUG
Release the baby

EEP
Well sort of

Thunk breaks through the trees riding a LANDWHALE Sandy
and Belt are riding the Crocopup Eep and Guy are riding
the BearOwl
