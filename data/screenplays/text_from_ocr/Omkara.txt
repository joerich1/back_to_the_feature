1 EXT ARID COUNTRYSIDE —- DAY
FADE IN

A dusty road stretching till the horizon in an arid landscape
There is a breeze in the late afternoon air and dust floats just
above the ground creating a kind of a blurry mirage We hear a
man’s voice on the soundtrack

There’s a thin line separating a moron from a fucking
idiot on one end of the line lies the moron and on
the other the fucking idiot snap the line and you

don’t know who’s who therein lies the million dollar
question my pretty polly

Two men squatting ona small hillock One of them-LANGDA
(so-called because of his gait owing to a congenital defect) Tyagi
—wears a pair of tattered jeans and covers his torso with a shawl
while the other —RAJJU Tiwari —is dressed in a groom’s outfit
right from the golden mojris to the golden prince suit almost
camouflaged in the surroundings His face is covered with the
flowers of the ‘sebra’ he wears on his head and he holds a sword

in his hand

A bus is parked by a tea stall down on the road A banner hung
on the decorated bus reads ‘Rajan weds Dolly’ A group of
baraatis strolls around the tea stall having tea and biscuits en-
route to the wedding

LANGDA removes the flowers covering RAJU’s face

shoulder He aims the shotgun at the bus

LANGDA

He shoots at the rear tyre of the bus and it punctures with
the impact of the shot The baraatis scamper in terror while
LANGDA calmly bursts all the tyres of the bus one by one
Meanwhile Rajju has jumped on the moped He scoots off on
the dusty road

LANGDA
(To the baraatis)

ITT STAT Oy TTT
The baraat doesn’t go any further the party’s over folks

A few members of the baraat take out pistols and force the others
into the bus

LANGDA
(To the henchmen)

Grab everybody’s phones

One of his men walks around with a gunnysack and the baraatis
drop their cellphones in it LANGDA seems satisfied with the
proceedings and turns around to look at RAJJU He has covered
little distance struggling with the moped The moped leaves a
trail of dust behind

LANGDA braces himself for the match point He takes his two-

what sounds like a posse of vehicles screeching to a halt outside
the hostel KESU and others react to the sound but LANGDA is
undisturbed KESU stops his men from drawing their weapons
and turns casually to LANGDA

KESU
Go baby

A group of men pours out of the cars and storms into the hostel
campus Guns drawn LANGDA on the other hand surveys his
target a la Shane Warne limps a step and throws the marble
Bull’s eye He jumps gleefully and utters a victorious cry He
then bends down and collects his marbles putting them inside a
netted bag tied to his trousers

As the marbles settle down on the ground the door of the hostel
opens up and a man walks out This is OMKARA ‘OMI Shukla

He walks up to RAGHUNATH calmly as all eyes watch him
He looks straight into RAGHUNATH’s eyes for a moment and

picks up the bucket and helps putting it on her head

straight on CAPTAAN’s temple He collapses in OMI’s arms
CAPTAAN’s men are rooted to their spot seeing their leader
dead OMI takes out a 100-rupee note from CAPT AAN’s wallet
and walks to KICHLU He puts the money in his pocket

of AgraThat night when the husband reached home
earlier than usual he found his wife in the throes of
passion with his own brother the vicious duo of the
brother and wife went on to commit cold-blooded
murder of the hapless husband that very night these
are some of the dire consequences that illicit relations
end up in Awake if you wish to sleep in peace

LANGDA is moved by the show’s content while OMI watches
nonchalantly As the host utters the last line power goes off
The room is in darkness but for the faint source coming from
somewhere in the street

Glad the lights went out it’s much better sitting here
in the dark The poor devout husband turned out to

be early on both counts reaching home as well as
heaven A treacherous wife is more fatal than a snake
bite brother I think the dead husband is better off up

there in heaven Imagine the plight of the mistrusting
one who continues to live under the same roof he
loves his wife so much he will lay down his life for her
and doubt her so that he will gouge her eyes out at the
slightest chance ok forget the husband-wife duo
spare a thought for the other man the bastard lover
who wrecks marriages Thieves steal money in order
to get rich but these fuckers they steal your lifelong
honour and leave you shattered to bits At times I feel
like bursting my eyes out so that I never ever have to
go through this hell myself

As LANGDA finishes his tirade his cellphone rings he takes the
call his eyes light up

until BILLO looks at them The song stops abruptly and she
rushes out KICHLU is at first unaware why BILLO stopped but

KICHLU is out of breath but continues to make a run for his

acorner and reaches the last alley from where he can see a busy
street which can be a life saver As he comes to the end of the
alley a car screeches to a grinding halt right in front of him
blocking the path to the main street KESU gets off KICHLU
grunts in frustration and takes out his pistol aiming straight at
KESU Before he can fire a shot though he collapses on his knees
OMI has shot him KICHLU turns to look at his nemesis OMI
shoots him this time right in his heart KICHLU slumps on the
ground very dead KESU looks at OMI OMI hasn’t brought
his pistol down yet He aims straight at him KESU sees pure
hatred in OMI’s eyes for him It looks as if OMI will shoot him
down any moment KESU is stunned He has no idea why OMI
detests him so His eyes show a hint of teardrop OMI’s gaze is
fixed unrelenting LANGDA limps up from behind and surveys
the scene He grabs OMI by his arm and brings the pistol down
He pulls OMI to make a getaway Panting he calls out to KESU

he reaches the edge of the bed grabs KESU by the collar and
violently throws him off the bed DOLLY turns to look at him
She rubs her eyes as if she has just woken up OMI looks at her
and turns back to look at KESU but there is no KESU it is just

INDORE SINGH’s bodyguards are taken by surprise and offer
little resistance to OMI who kills all of them within a minute
He looks inside the compartment for INDORE SINGH

LANGDA joins OMI in the search They search through the

lavatories and under the berths but there is no sign of their target
OMI comes to the door and looks out

INDORE SINGH dressed in pyjama and vest runs towards the
engine of the train Being overweight he can only run so hard
and it takes OMI little effort to catch up with him They are on
the tracks right in front of the train

The engine light illuminates the tracks INDORE SINGH’s face
contorts with terror upon seeing OMI He forgets to take his
pistol out OMI walks up to him and puts the gun on his mouth
Blood streams out of the back of his neck and OMI shoots

LANGDA limps up to the spot and is rather thrilled to see the
job done He walks up to the corpse and spits on it

her body by a group of unmarried girls to preserve her beauty

women apply the ‘ubtan’ on her hands and legs Gradually the
sound of the women fades out to be replaced by the shriek of an
eagle Only DOLLY seems to have taken note of this though
Her smile leaves her and she looks around to detect the source of
the disturbing sound She looks up and sees an eagle flying right
above the mandap The eagle hovers around the mandap and
circles for a few moments DOLLY looks at the bird her eyes
wide open It seems as if the eagle is also staring down at her The
women are yet oblivious though The eagle drops something it
had clutched in its claws and flies away The ‘thing’ falls straight
into the large bowl that had the turmeric being applied to her
It splashes and sinks under The women scream and shout and
get away from the spot Only DOLLY stays rooted to her seat
Her eyes are open wide and she looks terrified The turmeric has
splashed on her face The ‘thing’ comes up in the bowl It is a
