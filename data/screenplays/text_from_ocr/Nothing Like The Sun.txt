It was out of town far away And
very small Not as wonderful as
yours here

Alice is all smiles charms Lillian sees this looks around
the table with quiet disbelief

MS JOHNSON
What was their faith

Alice ignores her has a drink wipes her mouth

MS JOHNSON
Can you tell us more about their
faith

Well our faith was that we
never talk about our faith openly
nor do we ask others about theirs

My daughter and I have a church we
go to downtown

I wouldve preferred my son had a
wife from my own church But even
the Lord cant stop true love Yes

In ours we marry when the Holy
Spirit calls us to seek Him out

our church with their marriages and
families They confess to her first

Alice turns to Lillian goes quiet Ms Johnson continues

MS JOHNSON
Were having an outreach ministry
later downtown if youd like to
join us for that

ALICE
Thank you maam for your kind
offer But according to my faith
a woman finds the Lord by being at
home first - and through housework -
and then she considers things like
church and marriage later

Lillian suddenly speaks up

LILLIAN
May I ask something

ALICE
Yes Lillian

LILLIAN
What does your faith say about
wearing perfume to Service

ALICE

LILLIAN
In my church perfume means a
strange and powerful temptation is
nearby and is being used to deceive
others Was there anything like
that at yours

ALICE
No there wasnt

Shes not sure what to say next so she gets up from the
table collects the dishes quickly ends this conversation

can say to them what you say to me

Alice collects herself calms her nerves glances at Annabel
whos still despondent Lillian looks ready for something

ALICE
You have such a beautiful home I
love housekeeping Ive always
wanted to house keep for a man who
does good work himself

Alice pushes forward struggles to stay composed

ALICE
Your ad called for three days a
week at a modest pay Ill offer
full-time work thats seven days
for the same wage with room and
board

VEALE
Youre asking for a room instead

ALICE
No no Im not asking Im giving
in exchange for any other service
you may need

Alice lets her offer sink in urges Annabel to agree But
Annabel gets anxious troubled by something all night

ANNABEL
(to Alice)
Excuse me may I ask something --

ALICE
Well try it a month first on your
terms and if it proves successful --

Annabel repeatedly turns to Lillian for confirmation

ANNABEL
There was a woman we came across
recently downtown with the same
perfume you were wearing And she
was soliciting money from men on
the streets Do you know something
about this

ALICE
- Something about what

ANNABEL
About this other work I heard you
did -

ALICE
There are plenty of other women you
couldve come across with a similar
perfume
(to Veale)
Now lets discuss these terms --

ANNABEL
I was helping Ms Johnsons church
pass out their newsletters with our
ad --

VEALE
Is this true

Everyone skips a beat unsure if they heard correctly Alice
is taken back being found out down-plays it

ALICE
A room and board are very expensive
to come by --

ANNABEL
But thats not allowed

ALICE
-- Even more expensive without a
home or family to go to Imagine if
that were your situation

VEALE
No Theres no room for that here

ALICE
Thats all finished for good now
Its just the good Lords company
from now on No more of those men

Alice sweetly smiles to Annabel who weakens her stance

ANNABEL
Lillian if she needs our help we
should try

VEALE
Annabel will you excuse yourself
and go wash up --

ANNABEL
(pleading)
Shes blessed us with this meal

Annabels plea cascades to her father who reconsiders this a
bit more Alice rides on this pushes it along

ALICE
Yes Sister I have Thank you Now

days a week to begin with --

LILLIAN
No

ALICE

it for less Cook all this like I
have

LILLIAN

ALICE

days a week --

LILLIAN
The work offer was for three

ALICE
Im offering you more six days a
week for room and board only An
honest womans work for an honest
stay is my offer to you now

Alice reaches for Veales hand Lillian reaches for Annabels
hand pulls her back

LILLIAN
Why do you really want this work
with our family

Alice brushes Lillian aside brings Annabel back again

ALICE
For Gods forgiveness through His
work Amen Now of course with

have been

Blue Revision 35

Ive searched for a home and a family

Oh God Whats that for

JOSEPH
Its testing for sexual or venereal
diseases Anything irregular

ALICE
Sexual diseases How irregular

JOSEPH
Well do your regular checkup after
but we need a blood sample first

Joseph brings the syringe closer She backs away

VEALE
This is for your good and ours
Healing is central to our faith

ALICE
Yes But my new faith teaches that
a woman never allow her body to men
not her husband Even if they are
so decent and faithful --

VEALE
This will be important for your
husband as well when you marry
She reluctantly extends her arm He starts the blood draw

HENNING
Ten milliliters Not too quickly

Henning collects the blood work as Veale comforts her

VEALE
The Lords blessed us with you
here
(to Joseph)

We have a few others to finish
before everyone gathers Can you
finish on your own

JOSEPH
Yes sir I think so

They leave Joseph pours her another cup of tonic bandages
her arm then puts a stethoscope to her chest Shes too
distracted from the tonics effects to notice

ALICE
Ughhhgh That stuffs not normal

JOSEPH
Its Fathers brand of tonic that
improves blood circulation It was
his work as St Josephs missionary
doctor before his injury Ill
have this over with quickly

ALICE
Youre doing a nice job Your
father ought to be proud

He moves in closer slips the stethoscope over her breasts
JOSEPH
You smell very nice today Did
you wear that scent for the work
you did before you came here

ALICE
Its my natural scent

She notices him caressing her breasts with the stethoscope

JOSEPH

What did you charge for it
ALICE

Depends
JOSEPH

What did it depend on

ALICE
What I offered - what their wives
didnt offer at home

He stares at her chest entranced circles the same spot She
sees this smiles it off gives him the benefit of the doubt

ALICE
Something wrong with them

JOSEPH
No no Yours are a very good and
healthy pair God bless them

ALICE
Better than your wifes
JOSEPH
Yes -- No no They are both very

equal Very well Just a moment
longer Itd help better if
youd remove your blouse --

She HOLDS a deranged look on him - then lunges forward
wrestles him to the ground

ALICE
Arent you the faithful doctor and
husband Splash your tonic in your
wifes mouth see how she likes it

JOSEPH
Wait let us - let us discuss this

She doesnt give him an inch holds him down

ANNABEL
Elle says most of the senior girls

How many times did you pass by that
address I gave you

ANNABEL
Twice on the way back I think
they were out for the day I know
if my family could forgive the work
you did so could yours

Alice considers something speaks up

ALICE
How much do you know about your
brothers marriage

ANNABEL
What do you mean
ALICE
His wifes never around him much
Not even in the same bed

ANNABEL
Lillian says her faiths better if
she had her own bed again now that
theyve been married a while

ALICE
Thats not normal for a husband and
wife

ANNABEL

She attends our Service sometimes
for his sake and even invites me to
stay over when her mothers away

ALICE
-»- So what are you asking

that could - a pill - something
quicker to take care of this How
could we do that

extractives and liquorice We
prescribe it to anemic patients to
increase the blood count and cleanse
the kidneys Theres sarsaparilla
added to help with the taste

Its very strong She forces it down nearly spits it out

bleeding regular again Sexual
deviation affects those areas

carbohydrates Try a lean protein
diet red meat beets dark greens

during menstruation - sos
insomnia These should help

be home with your family
