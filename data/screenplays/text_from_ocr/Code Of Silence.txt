ENGINEER He controls the machine with a pistol-grip
device
that looks like a small TV camera

After the gyros are locked any
movement of the hand controller is
duplicated by the Prowler
He turns his hand to the right and the Prowler 50
yards
away sweeps its turret to the right aiming the twin

calibre machineguns at the politicians They move
aside
ENGINEER
This simple control system means
that even semi-skilled employees can
operate the unit with a minimum of
training As they say Even a child
can operate it

interrupts

to try and elude Prowler we can
