My old school was better

No Nooooo Mom the flowers are drying out

Its because youve been holding them the whole time

When we get home just put them in some water They should be fine

The first bouquet of flowers Ive ever gotten Its too bad they were a
going-away gift

Hmmm You got a flower on your last birthday
Just one and I wouldnt exactly call that a bouquet

Here your card fell out Ill open the window so please just sit still
Well be very busy today

SPIRITED AWAY -- THE MYSTERIOUS DISSAPEARANCE OF SEN AND CHIHIRO
What Did I take a wrong turn

Thats weird

Look I think its over there

Huh

The blue house on the corner

Were one road down

Can we get to our house this way

No way We always get lost like this

Just a little while longer ok

Rock temples Theyre the Gods houses

Dad are you sure you know the way

Leave it to me

Chihiro sit down

Honey stop fooling around

A tunnel

the tunnel

Haku what about you Haku

Ill have to talk to Yobaba and quit working with her
Ill be okay and Ill get my real name back
Ill be back in the other world

Will we meet again

Yes hopefully -- Hopefully -- Hopefully
Now go on Dont look back

Chihiro

What are you doing Come on

Mom Dad

Dont just go running off like that

Lets go

Mom Is anything wrong

Huh The moving van has already arrived
Chihiro come on

Watch your step

Chihiro dont cling to me like that Its hard to walk
Heres the exit Huh

What

Dang the inside of the car is filled with dust
A prank

Maybe

Thats why I said not to go

Alright alright its okay

Chihiro were going

Chihiro hurry up

Itsumo Nando Demo Always Time after Time
Lyrics by Wakako KAKU Sung by Yumi KIMURA

Its calling somewhere deep in my heart
I want to have an exciting dream always

There are countless sorrows
But I will surely see you beyond them

Every time one makes a mistake
One just knows the blue of the blue sky

It looks that the path continues to no end
But these arms can hold the light

My silent heart in the time of farewell
The body that becomes zero listens carefully

The mystery of being alive the mystery of going to die
Its the same with flowers winds and towns

Its calling somewhere deep in my heart
Lets make a dream always and time after time

Rather than count the number of sorrows
Lets sing softly with the same lips

In the closing memories
I always hear the whisper that I do not want to forget

Even on a shattered mirror
A new landscape can be reflected
The morning of the beginning the quiet window
Fill up the body that becomes zero
I no longer look for it over the sea

The shining thing has been here always
I have found it in myself

THE END
