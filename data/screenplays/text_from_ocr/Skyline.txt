INT GUEST BEDROOM - PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT

A COUPLE sleeps on a king size bed The valley in the
thousand count sheets between them is noticeably wide

A strange LIGHT streaks through the closed blinds of the
floor-to-ceiling WINDOWS lining the wall beside the bed

Shadows dance over their faces
She stirs Her name is ELAINE 20s a natural beauty

ELAINE
How’s it morning already

JARROD rolls over 20s thin and darkly handsome The clock
reads 350 AM He throws a pillow over his head

JARROD
It’s not It’s jet lag

Elaine puts her hand on her stomach Feeling nauseous

She stumbles across the plush shag carpet towards the
bathroom Opens the glass door The wrong way at first

CUT TO
FLUSH She exits the bathroom looking worse for the wear
Looks back towards the bed The LIGHT outside seems to have
grown even brighter
She slowly opens the bedroom door peeking out in the
LIVING ROOM
It’s even brighter in here And way more expensively
decorated Remnants of last night’s party lie strewn across
the granite counter tops not to mention RYAN and DENISE
sleeping on the shag and L shaped leather sofa respectively

Shaking her head Elaine closes the bedroom door

As she moves onto the bed the LIGHT outside goes nuclear
hot like someone just switched on the mid day SUN

ELAINE
Jarrod

JARROD
Morning sickness again

ELAINE
No look
Then the building starts SHAKING

He rubs the hangover out of his eyes to see the lights coming
from behind the blinds That is weird He gets up moving
towards the windows

Raising his hand he begins to open the blinds when-

WOMANS VOICE (0S)
Ryan oh my God

Her shout comes from the LIVING ROOM

WOMANS VOICE (0S) (CONT’D)
What are you-

WHOMP WHOMP Her voice is drowned out by an odd FREQUENCY
Jarrod looks to the now intensely frightened Elaine

JARROD
Stay here

ELAINE
What’s going on

JARROD
I don’t know-

WOMANS VOICE (0S)
RYAN

He motions for Elaine to stay put as he hustles into the

INT LIVING ROOM - PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

The room is bathed in an EERIE BRIGHT LIGHT Jarrod has to
shield his eyes just to see

DENISE is crouched on the sofa pure fear on her face

JARROD
What’s wrong

DENISE
He’s gone

Turning to his left Jarrod peers through the open BALCONY
DOOR at the strangely beautiful light shining from outside

Jarrod’s HANDS fall to his side VEINS BULGING outwards His
knuckles go white His pupils as big as quarters and black as
night

WHOMP WHOMP The FREQUENCY drowns out everything filling
Jarrods head with a mesmerizing rhythm pushing him forward
as the LIGHT FLARES OVER HIM

FADE TO

TITLE 15 HOURS EARLIER

The frequency gives way to the sound of AIRPLANE ENGINES
The WHITE HOT LIGHT fades revealing JARROD’S FACE

Eyes closed Hair flapping in the wind Smiling

He leans his head back inside the BACK WINDOW of

INT ROLLS ROYCE PHANTOM - DAY
CLASSIC ROCK plays on the radio He rolls up the window

JARROD
It’s beautiful huh

Beside him sits ELAINE She stares out her window watching
strip malls and power lines streak by

ELAINE
(playful)
Oh yeah Breathtaking

He leans over and looks out her window TACO BELL KFC CHECK
CASHING etc

JARROD
Okay I’ll admit I was expecting
more palm trees

ELAINE
The Phantom certainly fits the part

They laugh Look around the car
JARROD
Well Terry said he’d roll out the
red carpet but this is insane
She looks at the TWO TELEVISIONS on the seat backs
ELAINE

I know I’m afraid to touch
anything

Jarrod stretches his arm across the seat Pulls her in close

JARROD
I’m not

Gently caresses her cheek

ELAINE
If you break it you buy it

She playfully pushes him off But he leans in and kisses her
tenderly

extends the handle He hands Jarrod a tattered duffel bag

Jarrod grabs his wallet chained to his pants Thumbs through
three crumpled twenties a five and lots of singles

JARROD
Oh okay Thanks

Jarrod rolls Elaine’s bag to the FRONT DOOR

Jarrod starts shaking his head

TERRY (CONTD)
No to hell with that I need you

JARROD
What for I don’t know anything
about effects man

TERRY

But you have the eye You know it
Just apply it to something slightly
different Computer’s just a tool
Like a paintbrush

(He takes a sip)
Just that my brushes cost 200 grand
each

Terry smirks But Jarrod still isn’t sure

JARROD
I don’t know I just never saw
myself out here

TERRY
Come on man It’s time to step up
(he takes another sip)
Look There are other artists

trust This whole town is full of
flakes What I need is a brother

SMOKE wafts through the air Jarrod hands the butt to Ryan
There’s a handful of other SMOKERS on the patio with them

Through the patio glass door Elaine blows off the Douche and
storms into the guest bedroom slamming the door behind her

RYAN
That can’t be good

Jarrod sighs and heads back inside Ryan smiles when

A strange blue LIGHT FLASHES across the sky Ryan spins
around staring out at the city with a puzzled look

He turns to a SMOKING MODEL

(Off her vacant look)

It was the same color as your eyes

ELAINE
And what about me Jarrod My

ON THE NEIGHBORING BUILDING

Other PEOPLE stand in the same hypnotized state staring with
blackened pupils at

Hovering twenty feet in the air above Lincoln Blvd It pulses
with energy flowing out from its center Beautiful
Tempting Beckoning everyone near like a lucent SIREN

OBJECTS FLYING UPWARDS THROUGH THE AIR
Suddenly the lights die down The tremors stop
Everything goes quiet

No one knows what to say
CANDICE (0S)
(Annoyed)

Candice walks out to see

Terry lying over Jarrod His veins bulging covered in sweat
breathing like he just ran a marathon

CANDICE (CONT’D)
(Shocked)
Oh my God what’s wrong with him

Elaine pushes Terry out of the way jumping to Jarrod’s aid
His eyes are squeezed shut jaw clenched

ELAINE
It’s okay I’m right here

He finally eases up looking back like he’s blind

ELAINE (CONT’D)
Jarrod Baby can you see me

He shakes his head everything is a blur Still trying to
catch his breath

ELAINE

Then explain what happened to him
Jarrod looks up still disoriented

TERRY

Jarrod stands up gathering his thoughts He speaks softly in
a measured and haunted tone

JARROD
It was like I was flying Towards
this shimmering light But I’d
never seen the color before
He looks away from Elaine’s gaze

JARROD (CONTD)
It was beautiful

ROAR An ungodly growl ECHOES from the base of the building
Everyone is shocked Standing still for a moment

What in the hell was that

Terry walks to the windows Looks through a crack in the
blinds Can’t see anything Turns to the TELESCOPE

Telescope’s LIVE FEED onto the Big Screen

Elaine moves behind Jarrod puts an arm on his shoulder He
looks into her eyes nodding He mans the Telescope

making it hard to see anyone or anything outside

Everyone watches in rapt silence not sure what to expect

TELESCOPE POV SMOKE PLUMES on the horizon Eerily calm
There are several ABANDONED CARS in the middle of the Lincoln
Blvd Then A HULKING SHADOW tears through the intersection
Jarrod pulls away

TERRY (CONTD)

JARROD
There’s something down there On
the street

Terry shakes his head Still skeptical he gets behind the
telescope panning around

TERRY
I don’t see anything

group of RESIDENTS point and look off in the other direction

TERRY (CONTD)
Wait there’s people

Go to the roof

His words hang there for a moment Jarrod looks down
No one likes the idea especially Denise

EXT HELIPAD STAIRWELL - DAWN

Terry and Jarrod slowly moving up the last steps

On the neighboring building’s ROOFTOP they can see FIVE
RESIDENTS staring off at the city in the distance
EXT HELIPAD - DAWN

They reach the helipad Following the neighbors’ gazes to
see

The HAZE is clearing offering a sprawling view of the
skyline stretching out before them

With mouths agape they see some forty blocks away

TINY SPECKS RISE UP into the air - spiralling upwards into
the CLOUDS above

Then breaking forth from the cloud cover half the distance
away they see

A SHIP MASSIVE OTHERWORLDLY A NIGHTMARE

TERRY
What The Fuck

A quarter mile wide Like a single cell organism on an epic
scale It hovers in the air with pure unadulterated menace

Beyond that even more SHIPS become visible DOZENS of them
loom over the entire city

WHOMP WHOMP The FREQUENCY sounds From the bottom of the
nearest SHIP the INCANDESCENT SPHERE lowers softly drifting
towards the ground before emitting the SIREN LIGHT

Jarrod shields his eyes

JARROD
Don’t look at it man

Terry ignores him staring out at the horrible spectacle

JARROD (CONTD)
Damn it Terry

TERRY
That shit’s over a mile away

Jarrod unblocks his eyes to see Terry’s right He looks out
at the ship

Suddenly they see a SWARM rising through the air Jarrod
raises the camera to his eyes Zooms in Focuses

IT’S PEOPLE

Everyone in a three block radius of the SIREN is sucked into
the ship by a vacuum force

TERRY (CONTD)
That what I think it is

JARROD
My God

They stand there is stunned silence watching the human
population being vacuumed off the face of the Earth

When it’s done a HAZE of DEBRIS fills the air under the SHIP

Jarrod scans the ship with the ZOOM lens clicking away
Stops Sees something Lowers the lens

JARROD (CONTD)
Oh shit

TERRY
What

Jarrod begins backing away

JARROD
Run

TERRY
What

JARROD

Jarrod and Terry tear ass across the Helipad
In the SKY ABOVE

DOZENS of DRAGON-LIKE SHIPS around the size of fighter jets
begin launching off the MOTHERSHIP They are the HYDRA

One HYDRA heads directly towards them

try to pull it open No dice

Jarrod tears at the handle But it doesn’t budge

JARROD
Damn it

The HYDRA ship rounds the building it’s surface is a
horrific meld of living tissue and metallic structuring It
makes quick work of the NEIGHBORS of the adjacent rooftop
BOOM Terry shoots the lock again Still won’t open

A bright SIREN SPOTLIGHT hits them They shield their eyes as
the HYDRA lowers down towards their roof

In a last gasp they both pull frantically at the door
Giving it all they got Nothing Jarrod sinks to the ground

Terry and Jarrod share a look Preparing for the end
CREAK The door swings opens ELAINE stands before them

She looks into the SPOTLIGHT of the oncoming HYDRA Veins

door shut behind them

ELAINE
My head feels like it’s on fire

JARROD

I know It’ll pass I promise

She grabs hold of her stomach Jarrod looks down and places
his hand over hers Her eyes widen as she stares at his ARM

ELAINE
You looked again

Jarrod sees the VEINS on his arms are BULGING as well

ELAINE (CONT’D)
But how

Jarrod doesn’t know what to say

womb Almost instantly it SCREAMS violently lashing back to
life Limbs cracking into place as it begins REBUILDING

At the top of the stairs The coast is clear

Frozen in terror they slowly look to the right

In the rear plaza of the adjacent REGATTA BUILDING
A massive figure lurks behind the trees

It stops moving And turns slowly towards the group
THE TANKER TOWERS OVER THEM glaring menacingly

A long terrifying pause as they stare each other down

The Tanker gallops onto to the pool deck his claw splashing

the water
The Wife looks back Terrified Oliver yanks her arm

Come on

The Tanker spots the Wife Extends its CLAW

THE TENDRILS launch ensnaring her

She screams as the TENDRILS RIP her back through the air

Her body SMASHES through the GLASS fence surrounding the

eight feet below the pool area

The BACK DOORWAY is up ahead Almost there

The two muscle the bookshelf to the FRONT DOOR A barricade

OLIVER
Better than nothing right

JARROD
If you say so

Oliver roughly grabs Jarrod by his shirt Pure conviction in
his eyes

OLIVER
(Harshly)
What are you doing Huh Like it or
not this is happening
(looks to the girls)
You got to be strong
Jarrod straightens his spine Finally able to stare back

Oliver nods But never breaks eye contact

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Jarrod and Oliver walk back towards the couch

OLIVER
Is everybody alright

The weeping Candice looks at him like he’s an idiot

OLIVER (CONT’D)
Are you hurt

She finally shakes her head
Oliver looks to Elaine

ELAINE
I’m okay

Jarrod sits next to her taking her hand Tries to be stoic

Oliver sits across from them Takes off his uniform jacket
His dress shirt opens A GOLD CROSS dangles from his neck

ELAINE (CONT’D)
Thanks again You really saved our
asses

Jarrod nods in approval

Candice dries her tears Choking back sobs
CANDICE
Yeah thanks thank you

Oliver doesn’t respond Just locks eyes with her in an
intense gaze that she slowly shrinks away from

JARROD
What now

OLIVER
(Sighing)

We stay here Safest place I can

think of

JARROD
And

OLIVER
And We wait

JARROD
For what

OLIVER

For help We stay quiet keep
watch and pray someone comes

Jarrod looks to Elaine

ELAINE

He’s right Somebody has to This

can’t go on forever right

They sit in silence Not wanting to contemplate the answer

Candice lights a cigarette She blows the smoke forward

Tears still are running down her face

Elaine is disgusted She gets up Heads for the Guest

bedroom

OLIVER

Sweetie it’s best if we stay

together

ELAINE
I can’t- the smoke-

CANDICE

Given the circumstances I think a
smoke is more than reasonable

ELAINE
I never said-

CANDICE
From the moment you stepped foot in
here you’ve been a total drag-

ELAINE
And youve been a total bitch

Jarrod puts his arm around Elaine

JARROD
Baby it’s okay

CANDICE
Why don’t you leave then

JARROD
Stop it Candice

CANDICE
What’s wrong with you people

ELAINE
I’m pregnant alright

Candice exhales Realization hitting her

ELAINE (CONT’D)

Between all of the stress
and I just thought smoke is the
last thing

JARROD
I know It’s okay

ELAINE
I never even got to tell my mom

Oliver watches them intently Visibly moved A puff of smoke
passes his face He turns to see Candice taking another drag

OLIVER
Put out the cigarette

Rattled Candice stamps her smoke out in a decorative bowl
OLIVER (CONTD)
(To Elaine)
You okay dear
Elaine slowly nods
OLIVER (CONTD)

Come on Boss Let the girls sleep
Well keep watch

JARROD
Both of us
OLIVER
If they try that light stuff we
got each other’s back
JARROD
(to Elaine)
Try to get some rest Ill be right
over there
Elaine nods Lays down Jarrod kisses her softly
He walks to the telescope with Oliver
ELAINE
(To herself)
I fucking hate LA

Elaine looks across the couch to a tear stained Candice
Elaine sighs and takes a blanket over to her

CANDICE
I’m sorry I didn’t know-

ELAINE
It’s okay I didn’t really either

They share a smile Then lie down on opposite ends of the
couch

FADE OUT

INT LOUNGE AREA - NIGHT
They sit in darkness Not wanting to attract attention
Oliver scans with the telescope

Jarrod is behind him leaning on the fire place wall He’s
penciling on a SKETCH PAD in his lap

They speak in hushed voices

OLIVER
It’s quiet now

Oliver is still glued to the telescope

OLIVER (CONT’D)
Maybe the worst is over

TELESCOPE POV Nothing stirs on the streets Faint glows are
hidden by the clouds in the distance

JARROD
Maybe not

He turns the pad looking at it from another angle It’s a
surreal picture of the SIREN LIGHT Haunting Beautiful

JARROD (CONTD)
What do you think those things are

OLIVER
I don’t know Does it even matter

JARROD
Probably not
(sighs )
It doesn’t even seem real

OLIVER
Well it is real

Oliver turns to Jarrod sizing him up

OLIVER (CONTD)
And you better man up

(he looks to Elaine)
For her

(he looks to Jarrod)
For your baby

Jarrod stops drawing looks up

JARROD
We don’t even know if you know-

OLIVER
What are you blind She’s decided

Jarrod glances over towards Elaine’s sleeping figure

OLIVER (CONTD)

(Motions to the window)
All this makes it even more
important Not gonna be many of us
left

The words just hang there for a moment Too true
OLIVER (CONT’D)

That’s the problem with kids
like you

JARROD

You don’t know me
OLIVER

You got everything and you just

want to throw it all away

(looks at Jarrod)
Too selfish to grow up
Jarrod almost says something but stops Lets it sink in

Then goes back to drawing Head down

JARROD
What about you You got kids

Oliver doesn’t answer for a moment A change comes over him
OLIVER
(Pained)
I did Wife too
His looks down to the RING on his left hand

OLIVER (CONT’D)
My world ended a long time ago

Jarrod stops sketching Starting to understand Oliver

JARROD
I I’m sorry

Oliver turns back to the telescope Resuming his duty

Candice emerges from the kitchen handing them each an
ESPRESSO

JARROD

lost on him

OLIVER

He watches Candice walk over to the

Elaine stares at her for a moment

CANDICE (CONTD)
Just kidding

They share a laugh

ELAINE
God forbid you ever get knocked up

CANDICE

She takes a sip Slowly realizing she probably never will

INT MASTER BEDROOM - DAY
Jarrod stands in the doorway

Over Terry’s bed is a PAINTING of an angelic face on a black
background Jarrod stares at it Tears welling in his eyes

Candice enters behind him They exchange a look

JARROD
This was the first one I ever sold

Jarrod smiles
JARROD (CONT’D)
It was supposed to be a gift but he
insisted on paying for it

Candice nods knowingly Puts her hand on his shoulder

CANDICE
It was his favorite you know

Jarrod chokes up a little Looks her in the eyes
CANDICE (CONTD)
Terry could be such an asshole But
I loved him Everyone did
They stand there for a moment Looking at Jarrod’s painting

WHOMP WHOMP

They turn ducking down as a HYDRA whooshes past the
building

Holding their breath Watching intently And then
The HYDRA moves on The sound of the FREQUENCY fades away

Bored Tired The fight literally draining from their bodies

INT LIVING ROOMLOUNGE AREA - NIGHT
Elaine and Candice are splayed across the couch

Jarrod lays across two chairs Oliver sleeps on a seat before
the Telescope

It’s completely silent Almost peaceful Then

A FAINT BOOM is heard in the distance

The building RATTLES a bit

They wake with a start

Jarrod and Oliver look around listening
MORE EXPLOSIONS sound off in the night

JARROD
Take a look

Oliver puts his eye to the telescope

OLIVER
I don’t see anything

Jarrod picks up the remote to turn on the TV
Elaine sits up from the couch

ELAINE
What are you doing

JARROD
I want to see what’s out there

Oliver looks up

OLIVER
No It’s too bright Can’t risk it

Jarrod looks to Oliver then Elaine Puts down the remote
Satisfied Oliver returns his eye to the Telescope

TELESCOPE POV Only FIRE and SMOKE followed by bursts of
light on the horizon

OLIVER (CONT’D)
There

ELAINE
What’s happening

OLIVER
Somebodys fighting back

They all listen to the combat
The EXPLOSIONS die down The sound of one side losing Badly
Jarrod looks at Elaine Concern growing on his face

A few last BOOMS are extinguished giving way to

Silence

FADE TO

Frustrated he looks into the mirror Stubble over grown
Bags under his eyes His stare grows focused Determined

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Everyone assumes their positions Oliver at the telescope
Candice on the couch Elaine by the fireplace

Only Jarrod paces back and forth

OLIVER
Why don’t you take a seat Relax

Jarrod shakes his head Oliver sighs

OLIVER (CONTD)
Alright I’1ll bite What’s your
plan Boss I know you’re dying to
tell me

JARROD
I don’t have a plan-

OLIVER
Really Nothing you want to say

Jarrod looks over at Candice and Elaine

JARROD
Look We’re on a marina for
Christ’s sake

OLIVER
I’ve noticed

JARROD
So there are hundreds of boats just
across the street
OLIVER
Remind me how that worked out last
time

JARROD

We go on foot Quietly

OLIVER
And search every boat until we find
a key That’s great plan Jarrod

Elaine stands up Not liking where this is going

ELAINE
I can’t believe youd even suggest
this after what happened

JARROD
You make it sound like it was my
fault

It hangs in the air Maybe it was

ELAINE
I was practically begging But you
wouldn’t listen to me

JARROD
And you think Terry would have
listened to me

Candice looks at him with hurt eyes Elaine backs

OLIVER
Alright Let’s say you make it out
the building Across to the Marina
Down to the dock We find a boat
and everything Then what

JARROD
Then we get the hell out of Dodge

OLIVER
To where Catalina Down the coast

JARROD
Anywhere is better than here

OLIVER
How do you know We’re here and
were still alive

off

JARROD
I guess I have faith Oliver
Thought you might understand that
Whether it’s intended as a mock Oliver takes it as such

OLIVER
Listen to me you little punk-

VRRROOSH A sonic boom echoes from outside
The sound of something FLYING OVERHEAD And fast

ELAINE
What was that

Oliver hustles to the TELESCOPE He pans across the sky
struggling to find the source of the sound

Jarrod picks up the remote Looks at Elaine She doesn’t
protest this time He turns on the TV Everyone watches the
telescope feed on the screen to see

MILITARY PREDATOR DRONES

OLIVER
Hallelujah

A whole squadron of PREDATORS flying over the city towards
the MOTHERSHIP

WHOMP WHOMP The Frequency sounds

The PREDATORS are quickly inundated with SIREN LIGHTS but
they just keep coming

ELAINE
The light it’s not stopping
them

OLIVER

They’re unmanned

CANDICE
It’s about time

Oliver pans the telescope over
Everyone GASPS
HUNDREDS OF HYDRA ships swarm blotting out the sky

JARROD
Oh shit

It’s not a dogfight It’s a massacre The HYDRA don’t shoot
any projectiles They KAMIKAZE into each Predator Drone

EXPLOSIONS scatter across the sky One by one the Predators
are dive bombed by the Hydra

OLIVER
No no no

Oliver whips the telescope back and forth following the
action with a growing sense of horror His hopes and prayers
unraveling before his very eyes

He centers on the SOLE REMAINING PREDATOR as it weaves
through an endless sea of Hydra ships

Everyone holds their breath
Bobbing Weaving

OLIVER (CONT’D)
Come on come on

But it can only last for so long A wave of Hydra engulf him
The Predator cheats death for a second longer Launches a
MISSILE before

BOOM The Predator explodes in a burst of black smoke

Oliver struggles with the focus trying to follow the Missile
as it HITS THE MOTHERSHIP over DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES

FLASH Everything blows out to WHITE
The TV DIES THE POWER GOES OUT Nuclear EMP
Oliver looks away stunned Dives to the floor

OLIVER (CONT’D)
Everybody down

The HEAT WAVE rips across the city

The building SHAKES VIOLENTLY

ONE of the WINDOW BLINDS FALLS to the floor exposing them
for the first time

Everyone else ducks down The howling wind is deafening
Jarrod and Elaine make eye contact expecting the worst

Then the shaking stops

Jarrod rushes to the exposed window

ELAINE
Jarrod

He stops short looks back at her Slowly peers around to see
the MUSHROOM CLOUD over DOWNTOWN The Westchester BLUFFS
shielded them from the brunt of the blast

JARROD
Oh my God

The MOTHERSHIP spiral through the air across the entire
skyline before CRASHING into Culver City 4 miles away

Oliver scans the wreckage with the telescope

OLIVER
It It worked

He turns to Elaine She hugs Oliver Jarrod takes note
Elaine looks for herself Sure enough the Ship is down

ELAINE
I don’t believe it

Turns to Jarrod and Candice

ELAINE (CONT’D)

Tears of joy well up in Candice’s eyes She shakes her head

CANDICE

Jarrod steps between Oliver and Elaine

JARROD
You mind

OLIVER
By all means Boss

Oliver moves out of the way

Jarrod looks through the Telescope

Oliver and Elaine exchange hopeful looks
ELAINE

Do you think there’s more where
those guys came from

For a long beat Jarrod pans across the wreckage

OLIVER
Sure Now they know what to do

Jarrod stops on the downed ship Adjust the focus Sighs

OLIVER (CONT’D)
Shouldn’t be long before help-

Jarrod pulls his head away A look of deep loss on his face

ELAINE
Are you alright

Jarrod just shakes his head

A concerned Oliver bends over to peer through the scope
TELESCOPE POV The MOTHERSHIP is strewn across the hills
with HUNDREDS OF TANKERS HYDRAS and DRONES spilling from
its fractured HULL

ELAINE (CONTD)
What what is it

Jarrod looks at her

JARROD
They’re not dead

TELESCOPE POV HUNDREDS OF THEM move in a murderous WAVE of
destruction down the hill SWARMING across the city right
towards them

JARROD (CONTD)
Just really really pissed off

TELESCOPE POV Oliver pans back to the crashed ship to see
SOMETHING rising from the wreckage

OLIVER
Something’s happening

TELESCOPE POV A darker mysterious LIGHT pulses above the
ship A strange energy fills the air The ship’s DEBRIS
suddenly RISES UP spinning around the SIREN in a zero
gravity centrifugal vortex as

THE SHIP BEGINS TO REBUILD ITSELF

Oliver takes a deep labored breath Like the hope is sucked
out of him Doesn’t know what to say Then

OLIVER (CONT’D)
We We have to block the window

But Jarrod can see the resurgent ship through the window
clear as day Elaine looks back at Jarrod Fear in her eyes

OLIVER (CONTD)

Elaine nods Jarrod turns to her
JARROD
So now he gets to decide We have

no water no power—

ELAINE
But you saw what’s out there-

JARROD
Yeah and I’d rather make a run for
it than stay in a twenty story
target Between those things and
the radiation we are dead up here

Elaine looks to Oliver then back to Jarrod Uncertainty on
her face

ELAINE
I don’t-

A RUMBLING SOUND reverberates from outside the windows
Everyone stops in their tracks The sound grows louder

Jarrod moves towards the windows Follows the sound into the

crack in the blinds he sees

A BLACK HAWK HELICOPTER

coast is clear

Elaine Oliver and Candice enter the room

On the REGATTA ROOF

THREE SOLDIERS with thermal goggles and gas masks armed to
the teeth emerge from the CHOPPER

Jarrod goes to open the MASTER PATIO DOOR Oliver grabs the
handle

OLIVER
What the hell do you think you’re

JARROD

We got to let ‘em know we’re here
OLIVER
Youll let everything know We
can’t attract any attention
Jarrod looks to Elaine uncertainly on her face
JARROD
Youve been saying to wait for
help Well help is here-
He tries to push past Oliver but he won’t budge
OLIVER
Does that look like a rescue
chopper to you Don’t you get it
This is a war

They stare each other down

CANDICE (0S)
Where are they going

They turn to look across as the Chopper RISES UP taking
flight Jarrod watches in vain before spotting

The THREE SOLDIERS quickly and efficiently move across the
rooftop into spotting positions

JARROD
Theyll be back for them Come on

Oliver steps towards Jarrod

OLIVER

You can’t make that choice
JARROD

The BLANKET BLIND falls from the window

Outside they see the still REBUILDING MOTHERSHIP is now

Oliver looks to the exposed window pissed off then back to
Jarrod

OLIVER

She pulls her arm away Holds her stomach

ELAINE
How can you be so sure

JARROD

Jarrod goes to grab Elaine’s arm again

ELAINE
Stop

Oliver steps in between them

OLIVER
You heard the lady

Jarrod looks to Oliver in disbelief Turns to Elaine

OLIVER (CONT’D)
She’s not going anywhere

JARROD
That’s not up to you

He pushes past Oliver towards Elaine Oliver pushes back

ELAINE
Stop it both of you

OLIVER
I’m not gonna let you put her in
danger Not in her condition

Oliver BACKHANDS him across the face
Jarrod touches his lip Reaches for Elaine again

his face

Jarrod falls to the ground Oliver turns his back

OLIVER
Stay down Boss

Jarrod groans Doubled over in pain He pulls himself up
Elaine rushes to him but Oliver holds her back with his arm

ELAINE
Get off of me

Elaine beats her hands against his back

OLIVER
I’m sorry but it’s for the best

Jarrod wipes his bloodied face Stands up unbalanced

JARROD
Let her go

Oliver puts Elaine down Raises his arms Ready to brawl

OLIVER
You just don’t get it do you

Jarrod stares Oliver down

JARROD
You can hit me all you want

Looks into Elaine’s eyes

JARROD (CONTD)
But I’m not giving up on my family

Jarrod lowers his fists extending his arm out to Elaine

A long pause as Jarrod stares into Elaine’s eyes

She looks back seeing the boy she loves become a man
In spite of all apprehension she takes his hand

ELAINE
I am with you

He caresses her cheek They embrace and kiss
Oliver hangs his head
Jarrod stares back at Oliver
CANDICE
(to Oliver)

You’re just gonna let them leave

Jarrod and Elaine run for the door Jarrod tosses the
bookshelf out of the way He swings the door open

Looks back to Oliver one last time
OLIVER
They are making a choice
(he nods to Jarrod)

Gotta respect that
The doors shuts
Oliver walks to the exposed window
The almost complete MOTHERSHIP begins to rise upwards as the
plethora of CREATURES continue tearing across the city ina

Elaine nods Looks like she’s going to lose it He gently
holds her face in his hands

Jarrods eyes scan the neighboring rooftop to see A SOLDIER
with an RPG on his shoulder

JARROD

The Soldier spins weapon trained on Jarrod

RPG SOLDIER
Don’t move

The other TWO SOLDIERS emerge from their positions each
armed with Barrett Light 50 SNIPER RIFLES

They share a look Then slowly rise up

On the Regatta Roof the RPG SOLDIER meets their gaze

FLYING towards them from across the Marina

Elaine allows herself to smile Jarrod holds her tight

The chopper BLADES WHIRL loudly as it angles between the two
buildings heading towards the COVE’s helipad

SNNRRT Long and sinewy TENDRILS wrap around the Black Hawk

A TANKER crests the roof of the Regatta with its outstretched
TENDRIL CLAW holding the BLACK HAWK in mid air

SNIPER FIRE rips into the Tanker as the SOLDIERS unload on
it
BOOM The RPG SOLDIER fires at the TANKER knocking it to the

edge of the roof It teeters there for a long tense moment

The TANKER GROWLS Grabbing the RPG SOLDIER with its other
claw before FALLING OFF the roof and RIPPING the Black Hawk
down with it

Jarrod and Elaine hustle towards the ROOF DOOR when

BOOM BOOM They look out to see an AIRCRAFT CARRIER on the
COAST LINE Navy warships are fighting the Hydra

The entire skyline is filled with the unfolding battle
Our last stand

But they don’t have time to watch

Elaine opens the roof door to see

THE SAVAGE DRONE from the garage - a long SCAR across its
body - moving right for them

Elaine turns and slams the door but its TENDRIL slips through
the open crack wrapping around her waist

SIREN LIGHT seeps through the bullet holes as Jarrod and
Elaine push back against the door

Jarrod slams the AXE down chopping the TENDRIL off

The Drone HOWLS
Elaine throws the severed tendril to the ground

JARROD
This way

They turn and run back through the ventilation system
The DRONE SMASHES through the doorway

Its bleeding stump flails out slithering over the SEVERED
TENDRIL With a grotesque crunch the tendril REATTACHES

Jarrod points to the Window Washer SCAFFOLDING held down by
cinder blocks

JARROD
Come on it’s the only way down

Oh my God

The dying DRONE whips its TENDRIL knocking her back

It pounces on top of her It’s PUPAS SAC opening trying to
swallow her inside

The still entranced Jarrod trembles Rises to his feet
Overcoming everything he pushes forward The sight of his
woman in danger sending him to another place

JARROD
GET OFF HER

Jarrod tackles the Drone off of Elaine pinning it to the
ground The Drone bores into Jarrod’s flesh but there’s no
stopping him

Jarrod stares right into the SIREN LIGHT Using the strength
against it He TEARS at the DRONE’S FACE ripping away its
eyes BRUTALLY BREAKING it’s face apart with his bare hands
SMASHING DOWN Again and again

Till there’s nothing but oil and goo beneath him

CUT TO

INT KITCHEN LIVING ROOM - SUNSET

The TANKER reaches through the windows shaking everything

Oliver crawls across the floor Reaches for the LIGHTER The
CUTLERY BLOCK falls to the ground carving knives nearly
slicing off his fingers He pulls back his hand Close call

SNAP The Tanker’s TENDRIL wraps around his ankle pulling
him across the floor

Oliver is yanked through the living room all the way against
the shattered windows

At the last second 50 CAL FIRE rips into the Tanker’s back
from the TWO SNIPERS on the Regatta Roof

EXT PENTHOUSE - SUNSET

The Tanker turns to look at the SNIPERS with FURIOUS EYES
SNNNRT Its TENDRILS WHIP across to the Regatta Roof -
debraining the FIRST SNIPER - then whipping the remains into
the SECOND sending him FLYING off the roof

His SCREAMS drown out as he falls to the city below

INT KITCHEN LIVING ROOM - SUNSET

Oliver stretches to grip a CARVING KNIFE Stabs it through
the TANKER’S TENDRIL It HISSES

Oliver turns and runs back through the living room The
TANKER thrusts its arm after him

THE CLAW stabs through Oliver’s TORSO pinning him down
With his last gasp Oliver reaches out and grabs the LIGHTER
Looks up at the ugly motherfucker

OLIVER
Vaya con Dios you son of a bitch-

SPARK BOOM The entire penthouse EXPLODES

EXT PENTHOUSE - SUNSET

The Tanker HOWLS Engulfed in a burst of FLAMES

EXT ROOFTOP - SUNSET

Jarrod and Elaine are knocked back by the EXPLOSION right
beneath them The building rumbles and shakes

They hold on to each other tightly watching helplessly as
the SCAFFOLDING FALLS OVER the edge

JARROD
No

Jarrod lunges forward Elaine grabs him Holds him in her
arms Cuts all over his body He struggles to catch his
breath coming down from the rage of the entrancement
Jarrod looks down at his leg He’s bleeding pretty badly
CRUNCH The CLAW of the BURNT TANKER grips the roof’s edge

ELAINE
Get up

She drags Jarrod to his feet

The BURNT TANKER crests onto the roof Charred flesh Angry
as hell

They run up the stairs to the

HELIPAD

Running across to the opposite end Jarrod collapses Face
white as a sheet

The BURNT TANKER bears down on them
WHOMP WHOMP The Frequency sounds from above
Elaine looks up to see THE MOTHERSHIP IS OVERHEAD

A SQUADRON of FIGHTER JETS move towards it But they too are
kamikazed by the Hydra - exploding in the sky above them

SHRAPNEL RAINS DOWN ONTO THE HELIPAD
Now it’s Elaine’s turn to shield Jarrod
As the BURNT TANKER goes in for the kill

SMASH A DOWNED FIGHTER JET CRASHES right into the TANKER -
knocking it off the roof plummeting to the cul de sac below

Elaine opens her eyes Surprised to still be alive
She holds Jarrod in her arms Life draining from his body

JARROD
Please Elaine you have to go

ELAINE
I’m not going anywhere without you
They embrace Sharing a tender moment

HOWL Another TANKER crawls up the Regatta building to the
south And another TANKER on the building to the north

OFF THE COAST The AIRCRAFT CARRIER sinks into the Pacific
All the Fighter Jets are down

Our last stand has failed
There is no escape
Elaine and Jarrod hold each other tight

The incandescent SIREN SPHERE gently falls from the
MOTHERSHIPS belly descending towards them

Time stands still for a moment

Its harrowing And beautiful

They stare into each others eyes

A lifetime passing between them as they kiss

Then they look up into the SIREN

The trance overcomes them Veins protruding across their
bodies

But they don’t let go of each other

WHOOSH Theyre pulled up together through the air
Spiralling upwards over the building and the howling Tankers
Over the decimated city of Los Angeles

Up into the clouds as the SIREN light flares out the lens

FADE TO
TITLE DAY FOUR
EXT DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - SUNRISE

The sun rises over the rooftops as a DRONE scurries past Not
a single person in sight

EXT MANHATTAN - DAY

A TANKER is perched atop the Empire State Building
overlooking the desolate city below

EXT PARIS - DAY

The Eiffel Tower looms above empty streets eclipsed by a
HYDRA flying upwards across the sky

EXT AGRA INDIA - DAY

A vast shadow drifts over the Taj Mahal

Tilting up to the MOTHERSHIPS now slowly moving on like
stuffed predators slithering away until their next meal
EXT TOKYO - SUNSET

The once humming metropolis is now completely barren Not a
creature stirring

Human beings have been wiped off the face of the Earth
FADE TO BLACK
Then

SCANNER POV like 4D ultrasound meets x-ray vision looking
down on some kind of strange CONVEYOR BELT

HUMAN BODY after BODY passes through the scanner head first
An assembly line

We can see right through their skin scanning over the brain
then the organs muscles etc They look like nothing more
than animals

A familiar looking WOMAN passes through the scan It passes
over her stomach to focus on a SECOND HEART BEAT

She’s pregnant
The conveyor belt STOPS
Strange noises echo through the chamber Shadows engulf her

CUT TO

CLOSE UP

Of ELAINE’S EYES as they flutter open She squints still
reeling from the effects of the siren light

Laying on her back she tries to sit up But she can’t move a
muscle

Her eyes begin to focus on the strange biomechanical
environment Everything pulses with energy like the entire
ship is alive

She recoils at the sight of

HUNDREDS OF HEADLESS HUMAN BODIES The wounds cauterized

Then a DOME HEADED BEING sits before her A horrifying mix
of metal and musculature that we haven’t seen before

A surgical INCISION cut through the center of its cranium
Its large oval eyes are shut tightly

Beside it TENDRILS reach into a viscous TROUGH to retrieve a
HUMAN BRAIN with spinal nerve endings still attached

The human nervous system is slowly inserted inside the
BEING’S CRANIUM The TENDRIL seals the wound instantly

The Being stirs Looks up opening its large humanoid EYES
It tilts its head considering her for moment

The BEING turns and bounds across the chamber murdering TWO
DRONES in its path

It turns and stares at Elaine She gasps in horror Her eyes
widening in fear as the BEING LOOMS over her

With two slashes she’s freed from her constraints

She looks up staring into its EYES

The BEING bends down Reaches out to gently caress her cheek
ELAINE

(Whispers )
Jarrod
