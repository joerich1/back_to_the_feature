INT DARK PASSAGE
A dark cramped filthy place

SHAFTS OF LIGHT slice in from unseen cracks and crevices
giving us glimpses of a YOUNG MAN crawling in the dirt

CURT 19 He’s normally considered handsome but right now
he’s covered in sweat and grime

He stops for a moment Something is silhouetted nearby in the
dark

He clicks on a FLASHLIGHT and finds what he’s been seeking --
A LEAKY PIPE

He uses a wrench on the pipe’s VALVE SEAL It won’t budge

A RAT sits nearby staring at him
CURT
Well don’t just sit there Give me
a hand with this

The rat runs off Curt manages to tighten the seal and the
leaking stops

Then the old cast iron seal CRACKS APART Water gushes out

CURT
Shit

He starts shimmying backwards out of the CRAWLSPACE

EXT OLD RURAL HOUSE - OWATONNA MINNESOTA - DAY

Curt emerges from underneath a HOUSE His Boss ED (50s) sits
on the bumper of the PLUMBING TRUCK waiting for him

ED
Lemme guess you cracked it
(Curt nods)
Don’t sweat it

Ed looks through the parts on the truck for another seal

ED
You mind going back under there

CURT
Fine Not like you’re going to fit
anyway
Ed laughs a little and nods

ED
Better hurry up if you’re gonna go
see what’s-her-name

CURT
(sarcastic)
Wow She’s back in town tonight I
had no idea

ED
Only one thing I ever learned about
women - Never wait to tell them how

you feel

CURT
Oh I don’t know What’s a few more
years

Curt gets ready to crawl back under the house Rubs his sore
hands

CURT
You ever wish you’d become
something else Like an accountant

ED
Let me tell you something An
accountant can get rich but they
can also get fired There’1ll always
be work for a plumber

He finds the replacement seal
ED
Then again my wife left me for an
accountant so what the hell do I
know

As Ed talks Curt stares at Ed’s HANDS --

Callused and gnarled from thirty years of manual labor

EXT RURAL HOUSE OWATONNA MINNESOTA - NIGHT

Cars are parked all over the lawn of the HOUSE and a PARTY is
raging inside The high proportion of PICKUP TRUCKS gives
some indication of what kind of town this is

Another pickup arrives but this one has a utility body on it
Writing on the side reads “SUNRISE PLUMBING” CURT drives
INT CURT’S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Curt checks his hair in the rearview mirror About to get out
of the truck when he notices he still has GREASE STAINS on
his hands Frustrated he grabs some DE-GREASER from the
glove compartment It doesn’t do much good

He gives up and gets out of the truck

INT RURAL HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

The PARTY is in full swing All the local kids are back from
college and a few of the girls from the nearby high school
are hoping they’1l fit in with this older crowd

The center of attention in this room is a GIRL in an Ohio
State T-shirt She’s standing on the couch and yelling along
to a song with a bottle of beer as a microphone

This is LYNN She’s 19 athletic and beautiful And it hasn’t
gone unnoticed by the guys in the room One of them gets up
on the couch and tries to grind with her but she uses a
strong stiff-arm to keep him at a distance

To all the guys’ disappointment she JUMPS down off the couch
when she sees --

LYNN
CURT

She runs over to Curt who just walked in the door and gives
him a huge HUG Even wraps her legs around him for good
measure

CURT
Welcome home

LYNN
You’re late

CURT
You’re drunk

LYNN
Jealous

Everyone seems to know Curt and wants to say hello as he
tries to walk into the party It isn’t easy with Lynn WRAPPED
around him

CURT
You can let go now
Smiling she jumps down But then goes behind him and jumps
on his back for a PIGGYBACK RIDE

CURT
Where’s Jeff

LYNN
Let’s try the kitchen

He walks toward the kitchen CARRYING her on his back He
looks around at the size of the party People seem to be
drinking and mingling in every room of the house Most are
wearing shirts emblazoned with the names of Colleges

CURT
Kinda funny that everybody’s ina
rush to get back to little old
Owatonna

LYNN
That’s cause you’re here You’re
the only good thing about this
trailer park Shangri-La

CURT
Says the girl who grew up ina
trailer

LYNN
(playful)
Shhhhh

INT RURAL HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

JEFF 19 wears the same OHIO STATE T-SHIRT as Lynn He’s been
drinking and he’s standing near the KEG arguing with a few
other guys

JEFF
Four bucks each for the keg I want
to see you guys put in

The THREE GUYS he’s talking to don’t seem to be in a generous
mood All three of them have the same BAD HAIRCUT Maybe
that’s why they have a chip on their shoulder

DAVE stands nearby getting nervous
DAVE

Dude it’s my place and I said it’s
cool
JEFF
I don’t give a shit if this is your
place Dave These pussy cheeseheads
can pay for their beer

One of the three CHEESEHEADS gets in Jeffs face

CHEESEHEAD 1
What are you gonna do about it

JEFF
Really want to find out

DAVE
If you guys start any shit I’m
calling the cops

JEFF
Quit being a fag Dave

CHEESEHEAD 1
Yeah

JEFF
You calling my friend a fag

CURT
Jeff

CURT ENTERS and steps between them all Lynn is still on his
back She JUMPS down Jeff gives Curt a big hug

JEFF
Hey You made it

With the situation diffused the Cheeseheads all grab a beer
and leave the room

CURT
Making friends as usual huh

JEFF
Bunch of Wisconsin assholes weren’t
putting in for beer

CURT
Yeah And since when do you get in
fights

JEFF

There’s a lot of shit you don’t
know about me these days

Curt just LAUGHS at his drunk friend trying to be tough
CURT
Well try to chill out beer
muscles I still have to live in
this town remember

Lynn jumps on Jeffs back now and grabs his cup of beer

LYNN
Less thinkee more drinkee

JEFF
(to Curt)
Do you remember her weighing this
much
LYNN

(threatening with cup)
I’1l pour this on your head

CURT
She will too

Jeff nods Starts playfully carrying her around the room

INT LIVING ROOM - SOON AFTER

Curt and Jeff are sitting on the couch Jeff is noticeably
drunker Lynn is sprawled out on the couch next to them
Mostly passed out

JEFF
This place is stupid I mean don’t
get me wrong you’re cool But this
town sucks No offense You’re my
best friend I’m glad you’re here
But this place is ass But not
you Listen

CURT
Hold that rambling thought I gotta

take a leak Just keep an eye on
Lynn

STAIRS - LATER

Curt is coming out of the BATHROOM at the top of the stairs

Suddenly a COMMOTION down in the kitchen gets his attention
All of the people at the party start SHOUTING

Jeff and Cheesehead 1 spill out from the KITCHEN - there’s
some PUSHING and YELLING going on Curt shakes his head
CURT
(mostly to himself)
Jeff don’t do it -

Too late Jeff takes a SWING and BEDLAM ERUPTS Party-goers
all swarm around the FIGHT Curt stays put Until he sees --

THE OTHER TWO CHEESEHEADS

They’re coming up behind Jeff One of them has a BOTTLE in
his hand ready to swing it

CURT
Shit

Curt makes a split-second decision and LEAPS off the upstairs
railing - The two Cheeseheads crumple to the floor as Curt
LANDS on top of them

One Cheesehead WRESTLES with Curt as the third one is
deciding whether to help gang up on Curt or Jeff

The BRAWL is in full swing as Lynn sits up on the couch and
looks around She sobers up instantly and jumps into the
fray

The third Cheesehead has ganged up on Jeff until Lynn comes
up behind gets him in a HEADLOCK Curt manages to pick up the
guy he’s wrestling with and SLAM him into the wall

The guy Lynn’s pounding on throws her off She grabs a
CHAIR

LYNN
Hey

She hurls the chair at one of the Cheeseheads and he ducks
It brushes by his head and SMASHES a large PICTURE WINDOW
Everyone stops for a moment when they hear the SHATTERING
GLASS And that’s not all --

Curt sees it first RED AND BLUE LIGHTS outside the window
He pulls Jeff toward the kitchen

CHEESEHEAD 1
The cops are here

All the kids SCATTER around the house The underage ones drop
whatever beverage happens to be in their hands

Lynn goes to follow Curt and Jeff OUTSIDE --
EXT RURAL HOUSE - BACKYARD - SECONDS LATER

Curt and Jeff are running through the DARK BACKYARD Lynn
comes out behind them and quickly catches up

CURT
(to Jeff)
Nice work

JEFF
Go for the trees

They rush into the WOODED AREA behind the house Jeff gives
Lynn a boost up a TREE Curt climbs another one They seem
very adept at this
Jeff settles into the higher branches Shouts over to Curt
JEFF
Hey I forgot to ask Are we all

set for Saturday

Curt is busy nursing a BLOODY LIP He looks over at Jeff -

‘Are you serious’ Then he just laughs --
CURT
Yeah
LYNN
(whisper )

Guys Shut up
They can see a few COPS coming out from the back of the house
with FLASHLIGHTS They shine their beams around in the woods
for a while and then give up

Jeff gives a thumbs up to Curt who just shakes his head

FADE TO

EXT RURAL HIGHWAY - MORNING

Curt’s PICKUP TRUCK comes into view on a quiet stretch of
highway A CANOE is strapped on the back

INT CURT’S PICKUP - RURAL HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

Curt drives as Lynn sleeps in the passenger seat Jeff leans
in from the back

JEFF
You been getting any climbing in
CURT
Not really I’m a working man these
days You

JEFF
There’s a climbing wall at the gym
Got in there a lot

CURT
Not the same as the real thing

JEFF
Well we’ll see who’s first to the
top when we get there huh

LYNN

(sleepy)
Yeah It’1ll be me

Curt smiles at her

JEFF
Did Lynn tell you about her last
meet

Curt shakes his head

JEFF
I was there Got to see her set the
school record in the two hundred
meters

CURT
That’s awesome Did you tell
everyone you knew her back when she
was just some girl who smoked pot
in your garage

Lynn punches him in the arm
CURT
Hey Driver’s off limits You know

that

Lynn reaches back and punches Jeff in the arm instead Really
hard

JEFF
Ow

They’re passing through rolling FARM FIELDS Curt’s looking
for something off to the side of the road Sees it --

CURT
Hey guys look Remember
Jeff sees what he’s pointing at

JEFF
Uh huh

He doesn’t seem too enthusiastic as Curt slows down and pulls
over

LYNN
(perking up)
Hey Is that why we drove this way

CURT
Well yeah It’s tradition right

JEFF
When we were twelve

CURT
Puuussssy

JEFF
Okay Let’s do it

EXT HILLTOP FARM - CONTINUOUS

The three friends are trekking up the mild slope toward an
OLD BARN Lynn stops puts her hands on her hips

LYNN
Race you to the top

Jeff and Curt share a look

CURT
So we’re going to race an All
American track star uphill

JEFF
In these shoes

Jeff points to his hiking boots Lynn looks disappointed that
she won’t get to show off Suddenly Curt points over her
shoulder

CURT
Shit the truck’s on fire

Lynn turns around to look at the road and the two boys take
off By the time she turns back they have a good head start

Curt and Jeff smile at each other as they give it the best
they’ve got but Lynn’s GAINING fast

AT THE BARN

Lynn touches the side of the barn first laughing Curt and
Jeff have given up and are WALKING the last few yards

JEFF
(out of breath)
We were better off the blocks
though

LYNN
Yeah real mature And I was All
State not All American

CURT

You’1l always be All American with
us baby

INT OLD BARN - SOON AFTER

The remnants of the past year’s HAY fill this section of the
barn It’s not full but it’s still a big enough pile for --

A HAY DIVE

Curt leaps from the LOFT and lands on his back in the hay
mound some twenty feet below

CURT
Sweet

He rolls himself out of the hay just in time to avoid Jeff
JUMPING DOWN on top of him Jeff laughs

JEFF
Shit I don’t remember it being
that high

CURT

That’s because you never jumped off
it You always chickened out

JEFF
That’s not true Why would you say
that

CURT

Look out

Lynn is ready for her jump They clear the way as she does a
BACKFLIP into the pile

Buried somewhere down in the hay she thrusts her FIST up in
triumph

INT CURT’S CAR - LATER

They’re all LAUGHING and brushing hay off themselves Curt
drives with Jeff riding shotgun Lynn is in the back seat
trying to shake the itchy hay remnants from the inside of her
shirt

LYNN
Screw it

She WHIPS HER SHIRT OFF and shakes it out the window sitting
there in nothing but her bra Curt sneaks a look back via the
rear view mirror Jeff is eyeing her in the side mirror

Then of course the two guys catch each other looking
Nobody says anything and they put their eyes back on the
road But the ride has gotten a little quieter

EXT PARK ENTRY POINT - DAY

Curt’s truck comes to a halt at a large PARKING AREA and the
three friends climb out and stretch

JEFF
God it feels good to be back here

CURT
I can’t tell you the last time I
had time off

LYNN

I know After last week’s exams I
really need this

(beat)
Okay who’s ready to haul this
goddamn canoe overland for a mile
and then paddle for two days then
climb a hundred footer

Everybody smiles and raises their hands

LYNN
Well shit then let’s get relaxing

She swings her heavy BACKPACK on and starts to untie the
CANOE Curt goes around to the back of the truck to get his
gear While he’s out of earshot --

LYNN
(hushed to Jeff)
You didn’t tell him yet did you

JEFF
Right moment never came up Why
don’t we just wait until the trip’s
over

LYNN
I’1l do it

JEFF
No no I’ll do it Later though
(off Lynn’s look)
I promise

EXT BOUNDARY WATERS CANOE AREA (BWCA) - RAGING RIVER - DAY

The BOUNDARY WATERS is a million acre national park filled
with lakes forests and rivers

One of those RIVERS comes around a bend here breaking into
white foam along the high ROCK WALLS that form the banks

SHOUTING can be heard in the distance getting louder

The THREE FRIENDS come into view as their CANOE hurtles
around the corner

CURT
Brace

They stick their PADDLES into the water like three rudders
expertly steering through the RAPIDS and barely keeping their
canoe upright

Soaking wet they safely make it through the bend and emerge
into some calmer water

LYNN
Hell yeah

JEFF
Get ready

They steel themselves for a series of MINI WATERFALLS coming
up --

JEFF
Powerstroke

All of them paddle like mad leaping the canoe over the small
drop-offs It’s the most fun they’ve had in years

DISSOLVE TO

EXT PICTURESQUE LAKE - DAY

A LAKE as clear and blue as the sky above it Nothing out
here but the sound of BIRDS and INSECTS And the occasional
paddle

Curt Lynn and Jeff are in the canoe making their way across
the lake Curt is at the back He has a FISHING LINE trailing
into the water behind them that he checks on as he paddles

He sees a nasty knot in the fishing line and pulls a shiny
SWISS ARMY KNIFE out of his pocket

LYNN
Hey nice knife Did you get that
for the trip

CURT
Yup Even has a fish scaler on it

LYNN
Awesome

Curt smiles Lynn sets her paddle down

LYNN
Think maybe you’re ready to switch
spots with me

CURT
I don’t know Think you remember
how to fish

LYNN
Oh it’1ll come back to me
CURT
The exercise will do you some good

too
Lynn flexes her MUSCLES for Curt Impressive
CURT

Hey Jeff is that what all the Ohio
girls look like

JEFF
Depends on how many beers I’ve had

Lynn gives him a little KICK

CURT
Dude tell me the truth Are you
getting laid out there

Lynn shoots Jeff a look He turns back to Curt and just gives
a little shrug and a smile

CURT
That’s my boy I told you it’d be
like that College is totally
different Hey you ever get in
over your head out there let me
know I’1l come to town if there’s
a dangerous mission Don’t want my
wingman flying solo

Lynn leans forward and WHISPERS something into Jeffs ear
They keep paddling down the river

Curt squints up at the SUN burning down on them

CURT
It’s pretty hot back here Jeff You
mind paddling a little faster so we
can get a breeze going

Jeff leans back and WHISPERS something to Lynn She nods

CURT
What is this some kind of
conspiracy

They both turn toward him and smile - and then unleash their
paddles SPLASHING him with water over and over He
retaliates but he’s outmatched

EXT FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT

Sitting around a CAMPFIRE the three friends have finished
cooking and eating a FISH Jeff picks the last bit off the
bones

JEFF
How come everything cooked in the
woods just tastes better

CURT
Lynn remember the first time we
brought you out here

LYNN
Uh huh I remember drinking a whole
two liter of Coke by myself and
eating two boxes of Girl Scout
cookies

JEFF
And then you puked

LYNN
(laughing)
All over my Wonder Woman sleeping
bag

They’re all laughing now

LYNN
You guys all my parents let me
have at home was healthy stuff It
was like a junk food paradise out
here

CURT
And you started crying when my Dad
said he would take you home

LYNN
I was having fun I was okay once I
stopped throwing up At least I
didn’t pee on anybody

Lynn and Curt both give Jeff a look Lynn turns to Curt --

LYNN
How does that one go again

JEFF

C’mon You know it by heart by now

LYNN
I wanna hear it again

Curt happily goes into dramatic storyteller mode

CURT
It was a dark night in the woods
Jeff was tanked

JEFF
Strawberry wine coolers

CURT
I was going to leave that part out
For your dignity Anyway Lazy
ass keeps getting up to piss but
doesnt want to stagger to the
trees Just zips the tent open and
pees out

Jeff shrugs Lynn gives him a thumbs up and a wink

CURT
But later in a sleepy drunken
haze he doesnt realize he has
stepped OUTSIDE the tent he
turns sticks his schnutz INTO his
own tent and takes the worlds
longest whizz

Lynn bursts out laughing Like hearing it for the first time
The others join in

JEFF
(to Curt)
Not sure what youre laughing
about youre the one who got
pissed on

They all LAUGH harder Curt looks at the frying pan
CURT
Well guess what It’s your turn for

dish duty

JEFF
No I did the cooking

Jeff looks at Lynn

JEFF
I think it’s your turn

LYNN
No I think it’s your turn

Jeff gives her a look that says ‘come on you know’

LYNN
I’1l do it

Lynn collects the dishes and walks down to the LAKE As soon
as she’s out of earshot --

JEFF
So there’s something I wanted to
tell you

CURT
How long have you guys been hooking
up

Jeff laughs nervously

JEFF
How’d you know that

CURT
Dude I’m your best friend I’m her
best friend You think I couldn’t
tell Why’d you keep it a secret

JEFF
I wasn’t sure how to tell you I
mean you know

CURT
What

JEFF
It’s always been the three of us
Just all friends

CURT
But it’s different now You guys
are off in Ohio and Look I’m
happy for you Better you than some
frat guy

Lynn is walking back to camp from the lake carrying a pan of
water She sees Curt and Jeff look up at her

LYNN
What

CURT
Jeff told me

LYNN
Oh And

CURT
And it’s no big deal I mean if
he’s impotent why should it be a
secret

LYNN
Uh huh Right

Lynn sits down Jeff wraps his arms around her keeping her
warm

JEFF
I would have told you sooner but I
didn’t want this trip to be weird
We wanted it to be like when we
were kids

CURT
It is It’s all good It’s not like
you guys are gonna be banging in
the canoe or anything

JEFF
I hadn’t thought of that

LYNN
Yeah the canoe That’s hot

Curt smiles Lynn and Jeff are relieved that the whole issue
is out in the open

CURT
Yeah yeah just keep it down I’ve
gotta get some sleep
Looks at the TWO TENTS
CURT

I guess this means I can have a
tent all to myself Fun fun

INT LYNN’S AND JEFF’S TENT - NIGHT

Lynn wraps her arms around Jeff and gives him a kiss

LYNN
Hey

JEFF
Hey

He kisses her back

INT CURT’S TENT - SAME TIME

Curt can hear Lynn and Jeff talking He pulls out a SWISS
ARMY KNIFE Only this one is brand new still sealed in
plastic And it has LYNN’S INITIALS engraved on it

He looks at it for a moment then throws it back into his
pack

INT LYNN AND JEFF’S TENT - CONTINUOUS

Jeff is trying to get Lynn in the mood but she pulls back a
bit Looks in the direction of the other tent Jeff gets it

JEFF
We can be quiet

She doesn’t move Jeff tries to kiss her

LYNN
Not tonight It’s too weird

Jeff’s turn to look in the direction of Curt’s tent

JEFF
I kinda feel bad for Curt

LYNN
Why He’s making good money He’s
got a brand new truck

JEFF
Yeah but it’s in Owatonna Ten
years from now when we’re both
making over six figures he’s going
to be in the same place making
about what he makes now and still
trying to pay it all off

LYNN
Minnesota’s not the worst place in
the world Maybe he’s happy with
his life here

INT CURT’S TENT - NIGHT
Curt’s laying on his back listening to the VOICES from the

other tent He pulls his sleeping bag over his head and
tries to go to sleep

LYNN (0S)
(to Jeff)
Good night baby

EXT PLACID POND - AFTERNOON

The raging Moose River rapids eventually settle and split
into many calmer waterways One of them ends in this TRANQUIL
POND

Lynn stands near the shore up to her waist in the water
Curt and Jeff are out in the pond backstroking away from
her

JEFF
Say when

LYNN
Are you going to the canoe and back
or just to the canoe

Both of the boys are TREADING WATER NOW out in the middle of
the pond

CURT
Canoe and back

Jeff rolls his eyes and smiles as he gives Curt the finger

LYNN
Okay first one back here to touch
my hand wins Go

Curt and Jeff SWIM AWAY from her as fast as they can

Curt is swimming hard and his face is too intense for just a
friendly race But Jeff has fallen far enough behind that he
can’t see it

Their race takes them around a bend in the shore and out of
sight She hears Jeff yelling --

JEFF (0S)
And I’m gonna touch more than your
hand Lynny

Lynn laughs and SWIMS out a bit into the water to watch the
race but they’ve gone past where she can see She goes back
closer to shore to wait

She floats on her back and takes a moment to soak in the
morning sun It’s shaping up to be a perfect day

A WATER BUG skims along the surface Lynn follows it with her
eyes and suddenly sees --

A TWENTY DOLLAR BILL It bobs in the water impaled on a
small branch

She snatches it up and looks around Where could this
possibly have come from She swims out a little to see if the
guys are on their way back But there’s no sign of them

EXT CAMPSITE - NEAR PLACID POND - MOMENTS LATER

Lynn bounds into camp with a big smile on her face Curt and
Jeff are standing there still soaking wet from their swim

LYNN

You guys pussied out and stopped at
the canoe huh Too bad There was a
prize waiting for you

(holds up the twenty)
Check it out It was just floating
in the water Twenty bucks Right
back there

They just stare at her blankly

LYNN
Guys C’mon How cool is that

She’s puzzled by their reaction until she looks down at
their feet --

NINE WET DUFFEL BAGS sit there freshly pulled from the
water A few of them are zipped open Inside --

CASH Millions

Lynn just stares Shock She doesn’t even notice as her
precious TWENTY DOLLAR BILL slips out of her fingers and
flutters to the ground

TIME LAPSE

The three friends now sit in a circle All the BAGS have been
opened and the PILES OF MONEY are being counted

They regularly look over their shoulders for signs of other
campers Lynn is counting stacks She puts the last WAD on
the pile

LYNN
I get the same Five hundred
thousand in each bag That’s -

CURT
Four and a half million Split
three ways would be -

JEFF AND LYNN
(in unison)
One and a half million each

CURT
Yeah

They all sit quietly imagining life as a millionaire Until --

CURT
If we kept it

Silence All wondering how realistic a proposition it is

JEFF
Wait Let’s talk about the risks
here We all know the upside
What’s the downside

LYNN
You mean like if it’s drug money or
Russian Mafia money or something
And the bad guys come after us

CURT
It might not even be real What if
it’s counterfeit

Jeff pulls out his WALLET and removes a TWENTY He compares
it to one of the bills

LYNN
Does it look real

JEFF
I think so It has those little
fibers and everything It’s hard to
tell though It’s one of those old
style twenties

A light goes on in Curt’s eyes He starts flitting through

one of the packs of bills He examines the PAPER BAND around
it that says ‘BEP’

Meanwhile Lynn takes a closer look at the bills

LYNN
It’s got to be real And they’re
not in sequence either You know
The serial numbers

JEFF
What if it’s from a bank robbery
and it’s all marked

CURT
This isn’t from a bank It’s froma
lot of banks B-E-P I used to see
that when my Mom worked at First
Savings

LYNN
Well what is it What’s B-E-P

CURT
Bureau of Engraving and Printing

LYNN
Its from the US Mint

CURT
No The Mint only makes coins B-E-
P makes the money Did you notice
that they’re ALL old twenties

Jeff nods He gets it
JEFF

Shit yeah The banks gradually take
the old money out of circulation --

CURT
And send it back to the B-E-P to be
destroyed

LYNN

Well you know what they say - “One
man’s trash is another man’s
treasure”

They all just stand there Staring at the money The sun has
started to drop low in the sky

JEFF
So guys what are we doing

No one answers They look at all the CASH Mesmerized
Finally Curt snaps out of it

CURT
Whatever we’re going to do we’re
not going to leave it here And we
can’t take it up the climb with us
so that means we’re heading back
Right

JEFF
It’s a three day trek back out from
here I guess we’ll have time to
figure it out

Lynn hoists one of the DUFFEL BAGS over her shoulder

LYNN
Well we wanted a trip to remember

The three start to BREAK CAMP

EXT PLACID POND - NIGHTFALL

The last remnants of light are fading behind the mountains as
Curt throws the last of the NINE BAGS of money into the
CANOE They cover the bottom

Jeff looks at his HEAVY BACKPACK - no more room on the
bottom He slings it on and steps into the canoe

Lynn gingerly sets herself down among the money as Curt grabs
a paddle and pushes off from shore

JEFF
It’s going to look weird Canoeing
at night

CURT

Better than waiting here for the
guys that stole it to come looking

LYNN
If it’s even stolen Maybe they
were transporting it and it got
dropped or something

CURT
The US Government wouldn’t use
duffel bags It’s stolen

Lynn shrugs That’s probably true They PADDLE UPSTREAM
toward the fork that will join them with a larger artery
Paddling while wearing their backpacks is uncomfortable

JEFF
Might as well be canoeing all
night It’s not like we would have
gotten any sleep
EXT MEANDERING RIVER - DAYBREAK

The MORNING SUN rises over the tree line
have been paddling all night but they’re

well Lynn pats the bags of money

The three friends
holding up pretty

LYNN
Maybe I’1l1 take an extra long
vacation this Summer

JEFF
You know where we should go
Eastern Europe Someplace like
Croatia Right on the
Mediterranean great weather

LYNN
And Id bet they’d take American
cash too No questions asked

JEFF
Shit yeah We could buy cars there
property whatever

LYNN
And I sure as hell wouldn’t have to
worry about how to pay for grad
school

JEFF
What are you talking about You’re
a star athlete You’ll get a free
ride for grad school too

LYNN
Free ride my ass Do you know how
many hours I train every day and
have to keep up my classes

JEFF
Well if you’d start taking some
passfails like I told you to it
would get easier

Lynn just gives him a LOOK

JEFF
Hey it doesn’t matter now anyway
We’re rich right

CURT
Hold on We haven’t made a decision
yet I don’t know that we should
keep this

JEFF
Who says you get to decide that
You want to just pass up millions
of dollars without at least
thinking about what it would mean
for your life

CURT
Wait What if we only skimmed a
hundred grand out of each bag We
could just put the bags back where
they were Even if they got found
it would take a while for anybody
to figure out they’re a little
short

JEFF
(does the math)
What so we take three hundred
thousand dollars each And leave
the rest

CURT
We spend more than that and we’re
bound to get caught anyway I tell
you what it’d be enough for me to
set up my own business Free and
clear

LYNN
Or you could pay for college You
know Curt Ohio State’s always got
room for somebody paying full
tuition

Jeff glances back at Curt He sees Curt STOP PADDLING for a
moment Maybe the college idea has gotten some traction

With mixed emotions Jeff focuses on paddling again

JEFF
That doesn’t make sense We’re
taking a big risk either way If
I’m taking a chance like this it’s
to be a millionaire not to keep a
few hundred grand

The others give this some thought

LYNN
He’s right It’s all or nothing

Curt doesn’t argue They might be right Lynn and Jeff look
at him Which is it going to be

CURT
Wait

Curt holds up his hand He POINTS They can see a BUILDING
silhouetted on the shore ahead --

A RANGER STATION

Just a small hut raised up on pylons near the edge of the
water

LYNN
Is there somebody there

JEFF
I can’t tell that might be the
ranger there over by the water

LYNN
Yeah he’s there I just saw him
move I think he’s looking at us

As they float closer they can all see him He seems to be
looking in their direction as they approach

Lynn and Jeff look at the DUFFEL BAGS and then at CURT

No one speaks as they move toward the station Lynn shifts

her weight and the bags of money RUSTLE beneath her Maybe

she’s trying to remind them Maybe she just wanted to touch
the millions one last time

The sound gets Curt’s attention Scenarios swirl in his mind
as he eyes the RANGER clearly visible now in his green
uniform They’re already within shouting distance Paddling
CLOSER

Jeff licks his lips anxious Stares hard at Curt’s back
trying to suss out what’s in his heart

JEFF
(whispering)
Curt
CURT
(shouts to shore)
Hey there

Jeff and Lynn are nervous Lynn GRABS Curt’s leg

RANGER
How’s it going

JEFF
Fine thanks

Jeff paddles just a bit faster eager to keep moving But
Curt paddles backwards a bit slowing them down

RANGER
Saw that you’re coming from Moose
River Have you been on shore at
all

Everyone STOPS PADDLING No one answers Finally CURT speaks
up

CURT
Just one night upriver there and
some portages

RANGER
Did you happen to see anybody that
might look like a poacher We had a
report of somebody finding a bear
trap

CURT
No nothing like that

There is a pregnant pause it almost seems as if Curt is
about to say more Jeff grips his paddle tightly

CURT
Well have a good one

Curt gives a friendly WAVE as they all paddle on out to more
open water

The Ranger nods then turns away He doesn’t bother to give
them a second glance as they slip downriver into the
distance

EXT PORTAGE NEAR RAPIDS - DAY

A series of vicious RAPIDS make this section of the Boundary
Waters impassable by boat Curt Jeff and Lynn are WALKING
their canoe over a nearby PORTAGE (a piece of land that
bridges two bodies of water or bypasses rapids)

LYNN
Okay Break

They set the CANOE down and drop to the ground throwing
their packs aside Leaning up against the canoe the three of
them look inside it

All those BAGS of money

CURT
So I’m assuming you guys aren’t
into just skimming a little off the
top huh

Jeff and Lynn shake their heads

CURT
(starts to smile)
Well then I guess we’re all
millionaires

Jeff and Lynn look at each other We ARE keeping all of it

JEFF
Hell yeah

Curt and Jeff touch fists Lynn throws her head back and
smiles

LYNN
Whoever said money can’t buy
happiness was an asshole I am so
fucking happy right now

Jeff puts his arm around her She pulls Curt in for a GROUP
HUG as they all start to laugh

PORTAGE NEAR RAPIDS - LATER

The three friends are still lying back against the canoe
basking in their newfound wealth

CURT
Maybe after we get back from Europe
I should think about joining you
guys at Ohio State Be nice to have
a degree under my belt when I start
my own business

He gives a good natured punch to Jeff who doesn’t look too
excited about the idea of Curt joining them at College

Curt starts to get up and puts his knee down onto the wet
ground - It sinks in five inches of mud

CURT
(looking at his pants)
Goddamnit I just bought these at
R-E-I Hundred bucks

They realize the irony Jeff bursts out laughing

JEFF

Ill buy you another pair buddy
CURT

Yeah Okay I’1ll get you a new

shirt

With that Curt hurls a handful of MUD right onto Jeffs
shirt Jeff gives a wicked smile and there is a pregnant
pause as he prepares his counter attack

LYNN
Guys

Both of them turn and throw mud at Lynn

LYNN
Shit I knew it

She takes cover behind the canoe and grabs some mud for
herself A big HANDFUL Staying out of sight she yells --

LYNN
Hey Curt

CURT
(holding his next clump to
throw)
Yeah

She pops up from behind the canoe and NAILS him in the head
with a huge heap of mud

LYNN
I’1l buy you a day at the salon

Jeff can’t believe what just happened to Curt He laughs and
throws mud at Lynn to keep her on the defensive It doesn’t
take long before they’re all COVERED

EXT PORTAGE NEAR RAPIDS - LATER

The three friends are busy at the edge of the water trying
to get all the MUD off They’re all smiling as they move back
to the CANOE

They get ready to lift with Jeff holding the back And
then it happens Jeff loses his grip for just a moment

The canoe DROPS and one of the duffel bags tips out rolling
toward the WATER

JEFF
Shit

The bag slides right by Lynn’s feet She stands there staring
at it - STUNNED as it slides into the current

CURT
Lynn

When she finally makes a move for it it’s too far out in the
water

Jeff and Curt quickly throw down the canoe as they watch the
black bag being whipped away from them by the rushing water

JEFF
No no no no

The bag hits a rock and for a moment it looks like it will
stick there All three watch it speechless Curt starts to
take one hesitant step into the water

Then the bag DETACHES and continues down the rapids

JEFF
Shit

It pauses on its journey and swirls in one particular spot
before getting SUCKED BELOW

Jeff grabs a length of ROPE from the canoe ready to go after
it
CURT
Jeff wait

JEFF
That’s five hundred grand in there

Curt looks at the spot where the money got sucked under He
takes off his jacket --

CURT
(to Jeff)
I should go

Jeff doesn’t argue Curt ties the rope around his waist and
WADES IN as the others hold the line

He doesn’t get more than a few steps into the rapids before
he’s KNOCKED off his feet

LYNN
Curt

He goes under but quickly surfaces Manages to pull himself
along grabbing the slippery rocks and fighting the current
He DIVES into the spot where they last saw the bag

Tense moments go by as he doesn’t come up MORE time passes
Lynn and Jeff are getting concerned

LYNN
Pull the rope

JEFF
Not yet

They watch the spot where Curt went under Lynn’s getting
more nervous

LYNN
No Jeff pull him up Pull him up
now

Jeff nods They pull HARD on the rope and Curt comes to the
surface COUGHING and SPUTTERING

LYNN
Curt You all right

Curt WAVES at them but is too out of breath to say anything
They pull on the rope to keep him from washing downstream
Finally he makes it to shore

Catching his breath --

CURT
It’s gone guys It’s not there
anymore

JEFF

We gotta go downstream See if it
washed up somewhere

CURT
Forget it Around that bend these
rapids go to class four then it’s
open water all the way to Lake
Superior It’s gone dude It’s
gone

Jeff just stares down at the water

JEFF
I didn’t do it on purpose

LYNN
Five hundred thousand Just
washed away

JEFF
(looks up)
Could you just shut up

Lynn looks at Jeff as if she’s about to hit him Instead
she marches over to the canoe Starts PULLING OUT all the
bags

Curt and Jeff share a look Jeff helps Curt on his feet and
they join Lynn at the canoe

JEFF
Lynn I’m sorry okay

Lynn is dumping her camping gear from her backpack into the
canoe

CURT
What are you doing

LYNN
I’m making room

Curt and Jeff don’t get it at first Then Lynn empties three
duffel bags of cash into HER backpack

JEFF
Come on Lynn This is ridiculous

CURT
Maybe we should split it up you
know not keep all our eggs in one
basket

Lynn slings her backpack on

JEFF
What Are you saying we’re
splitting it up now We all carry
our own shares from now on

Curt shrugs his shoulders Jeff sighs grabs his backpack

JEFF
So how do we divide it up then Two
bags each and split the third three
ways

LYNN
As far as I’m concerned I didn’t
drop the bag so I still have three

JEFF
What That’s bullshit We didn’t
decide to divide it up until just
now It was everybody’s money We
should each lose a third of what
was in the bag

LYNN
We knew it was a million and a half
a piece You’re the one who screwed
up

JEFF
Is that right Like when you just
stood there like a statue and it
went right by your feet All you
had to do was put your foot on it
and everything would have been just
fine

Lynn gives him a look

JEFF
Or what about the fact that Curt
here couldn’t get it out of the
water Doesn’t that figure in

CURT
Hey wait a minute

JEFF
Fuck you Curt You and your “class
four all the way to Lake Superior”
bullshit It’s not too late we can
go after it

Curt does a slow burn Grabs JEFF’S BACKPACK from the canoe
and tosses it to him

CURT
You want to try for it Go ahead
it’s your money

Curt grabs HIS backpack empties it into the canoe and jams
his money inside

Jeff looks at the two bags left and then at where the rapids
disappear around the bend Contemplates going it alone

But ultimately he too empties his backpack out into the
canoe

EXT LONG MISTY LAKE - LATER

They’ve crossed the portage to a calmer body of water A low
MIST lays near the surface The canoe is in the water and
they’re getting in

The duffel bags are in the bottom of the canoe but now
they’re filled with camping gear

Jeff takes the middle of the canoe with Curt and Lynn
paddling at the ends He’s quiet

EXT LONG MISTY LAKE - SOME TIME LATER

The rolling mist on the surface has grown into a hanging FOG
Visibility is low They stay close to shore to keep their
bearings

Stroke after stroke they paddle forward with no horizon in
sight They watch the fog open in front of them and close
behind as if moving through an INFINITE VOID

Curt’s eyes lock on to SOMETHING on the shore Something that
has just appeared in the mist It’s a MAN watching them

Lynn and Jeff see him too --

He’s big with a military haircut and a demeanor to match

Half of his face is scraped and swollen from some recent
trauma One of his EYES is half filled with blood

The three all stop paddling for a moment unnerved by the
sight of him The lake noises around them seem to stop as
they catch his gaze Like they’re floating through some kind
of NIGHTMARE

Then Curt starts them up again and they paddle away

The man’s name is MILLER He watches the canoe fade into
grey then continues in the opposite direction

He doesn’t hear the WHISPERS somewhere off in the fog --
CURT (0S)

(hushed)
Did you see that guy

JEFF (0S)
Yeah Let’s hurry up and get the
hell out of here

EXT SLOW PART OF THE RIVER - LATER IN THE DAY
Not much of a current here Curt and Jeff are paddling hard

JEFF
You think that bag has stopped
moving by now

The others don’t answer

JEFF
Way I figure it it either got
caught in the rapids and sank or
it’ll settle out in drop in the
bottom of a lake

Lynn looks back at Curt - “Is he still thinking of going
after it”

JEFF
Either way nobody else is going to
get it Hey I’m a millionaire I
can deal with losing some money I
just wouldn’t want somebody else to
have it

Jeffs SMILE is a welcome break in the tension

CURT
Yeah because they didn’t earn it

JEFF
(laughing)
That’s right I worked my whole
life for this million

LYNN
Doing what exactly

JEFF
Putting out good karma That’s hard
work

Lynn turns around smiling glad that he’s not still bitter

She looks at their surroundings now that the fog has lifted

LYNN
You know there might be a faster
way home We could double back and
cut overland to the Kawishiwi
river

JEFF
And how does the canoe get there

CURT
You mean haul it up the side of the
cliff with us

Lynn nods Jeff looks at Curt

JEFF
We did it back in the scouts when
we were in St Croix

CURT
We had about fifteen of us then

JEFF
Fifteen little shits We’re grown
men now That’s gotta even it out
right

Curt whips out a pair of BINOCULARS from his pack He studies
a nearby CLIFF Hands his binoculars to Lynn

CURT
What do you think You want to try
it

EXT SHOAL CLIFF - LATE AFTERNOON

A WALL OF ROCK looms straight up from the riverbed some fifty
feet Lynn stands on a small shoal of gravel at the bottom a
ROPE in her hand

The rope leads all the way up the cliff to Curt and Jeff
standing among the grass and trees at the top Floating in
the space between is their CANOE

Curt and Jeff are raising it up the side with their two ropes as
Lynn tries to guide it with her rope from the bottom It’s slow
going as it frequently gets snagged on rocky outcroppings

THE CANOE
Its FRONT TIE OFF POINT smacks against the rocks repeatedly

A stress CRACK has formed and it’s widening An overhang
SNAGS the body of the canoe

Below Lynn positions herself underneath and whips her rope
away from the cliff trying to clear the obstacle

LYNN
Pull now

Up the cliff Curt has his rope wrapped around a small tree
using it as a makeshift pulley He gives it a good YANK --

And the tie off point BREAKS LOOSE

The canoe suddenly swings down and DROPS The force of the
drop pulls out the slipknot on Jeffs side --

The canoe hurtles down toward Lynn smacking against the
rocks and spinning as it goes Panicked Lynn throws herself
against the cliff wall and covers her head

The canoe just barely passes over her SMASHING on the nearby
ROCKS of the shoal Lynn takes a breath and uncovers her
head

LYNN
Shit

JEFF
What happened

LYNN
What does it look like

She steps over to the canoe Large GASHES have opened in the
fiberglass skin

LYNN
We’re screwed

Up above Curt and Jeff can see it They shake their heads in
dismay
EXT PLACID POND - DAYBREAK

Miller is standing at the spot where the pond goes around a
bend This is where the three friends found the money

He knows that if his bags did float down this way they would
have stopped here He quickly finds --
EXT CAMPSITE - NEAR PLACID POND - SOON AFTER

Miller is holding the single TWENTY DOLLAR BILL that Lynn
dropped earlier He examines the ground

He can see that someone camped here recently A canoe was
dragged here into the water

In his mind he flashes back to

EXT LONG MISTY LAKE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Moving through the fog are CURT JEFF AND LYNN in the canoe
They spot Miller staring at them and stop paddling

Jeffs eyes flit down at something in the bottom of the
canoe Then they all start paddling again fading into
grey

END FLASHBACK

EXT CAMPSITE - NEAR PLACID POND

Miller swears under his breath and moves off quickly from the
campsite He’s on the hunt now

EXT PINE GROVE - NIGHT

Lynn and Jeff are setting up camp by FLASHLIGHT Jeff unpacks
their tents as Lynn starts digging a FIRE PIT Curt is
absent

LYNN
You sure we should light a fire
Maybe we don’t want to call
attention to ourselves

JEFF
If somebody’s looking for us
they’1l find our camp either way
At least this way we won’t look
like we have something to hide

LYNN
I just want to get home I kinda
feel like we should just keep
moving

JEFF
We can’t take any more risks We
have to be patient and do this
right Stick together Just think
about all the money we’1ll have when
it’s over

Lynn looks over at their BAGS

JEFF
I can actually pay off my student
loans without using my elaborate
plan to fake my own death

LYNN
(looking at their gear)
You know we have to carry all this
crap now

Jeff puts his arm around her

JEFF
I can carry some of your gear if
you need me to

LYNN
Curt was saying we should drop
everything and just bring a couple
of emergency blankets and whatever
food we can put in our pockets

Jeff stops hugging her goes back to setting up camp
JEFF
Yeah he’s probably right Always

knew what to do in a crisis

Stops working on the camp and turns back to look at her

JEFF
You really think he’d be happy in
Ohio

LYNN

I don’t like him living hundreds of
miles away I thought you said it
sucked here

JEFF
Well yeah for us But it’s
different for him He’s got a
career going here

LYNN
He’s your best friend Don’t you
want us all to hang out more

JEFF
Maybe it would be awkward for him
now Because of us

LYNN
That’s stupid We’re all still
friends That’s the best part about
this whole thing we all get to be
rich and we all get to share the
secret I mean if I had found the
money on my own you guys are the
ones I’d want to share it with

Jeff narrows his eyes at her
JEFF
But not the money I dropped in the

water right

LYNN
I thought you were over that

CURT (0S)
Well that sucks

Curt appears holding a small TROUT at the end of a fishing
line

CURT
Pike bit off two of my hooks and
all I got was this guy

Curt throws the little fish down in a frying pan He gets the
sense that maybe he interrupted something with Lynn and Jeff

CURT
I’m gonna go get some firewood

LYNN
(breaking away from Jeff)
I’1l come with you

EXT FOREST NEAR THE PINE GROVE - SOON AFTER

Curt and Lynn are gathering dry wood for the fire They pass
an old DEAD TREE with a PROTRUDING STUB of a branch

CURT
What does that look like to you

From where they’re standing it looks a lot like a man with an
erect penis Lynn smiles and BREAKS OFF the stub

CURT
Damn That’s just wrong

They laugh It feels good to break the tension

EXT PINE GROVE - SAME TIME

Jeff is making sure the backpacks are disguised under a
foliage-covered TARP He hears Lynn’s LAUGHTER from somewhere
off in the woods He can hear CURT talking too

Though he can’t quite make out what’s being said it sure
SOUNDS like his best friend and his girlfriend are having a
good time

He opens CURT’S BACKPACK and stares at the money inside He
flips through one of the banded packs of bills

Notices something A PHOTO is tucked into the front pocket of
Curt’s backpack

Pulls it out A snapshot of the three of them standing
together smiling Happier times

Feeling a twinge of guilt he starts to put the photo back

Then he sees that its CREASED on one side A heavy crease
from the photo being folded over countless times --

Folded so that it TAKES JEFF OUT of the picture and becomes a
photo of just Curt and Lynn

EXT FOREST NEAR PINE GROVE - CONTINUOUS

Lynn and Curt have gathered up most of the BRANCHES they
need Curt sits down on an OUTCROPPING of rock Lynn joins
him happy to set down her load of wood for a moment

CURT
I was thinking about what
happened with the bag Jeff lost
Maybe we can split things up a
little more evenly

LYNN
Maybe But I don’t mind making him
sweat about it a little longer He
can be a real dick sometimes

CURT
Yeah

LYNN
You know how he is He thinks
everything needs to be done his
way thinks he knows how everybody
else should be living their life
Curt shakes his head

LYNN (cont’d)
It’s like I have to listen to two
coaches my track coach and my
‘life coach’ That’s what he calls
himself Well no relationship is
perfect

He nods Lynn stands up Looks away from him

LYNN
What about you Are you seeing
anybody You never tell me about
your personal life anymore

He doesn’t answer

LYNN
Curt The other day I was
looking for another can of sterno
in your bag I wasn’t trying to
snoop around but I found that
Swiss Army knife you got for me
With my initials

CURT
(hesitant)
Um yeah the thing about that -

LYNN
That was really sweet of you

CURT
Kind of seems like a stupid idea
given the current circumstances

LYNN
No No it wasn’t

CURT
It’s cool Lynn I get it We both
know what it was like to grow up
the way we did A guy like Jeff
he can offer a life that’s more
secure

LYNN
That’s what you think That I’m
some kind of gold digger

CURT
Maybe that came out wrong Look I
just was wondering what happened
(MORE)

CURT (contd)
How you guys ended up together
And why you didn’t want to tell me

LYNN
Because it’s not that big a deal
We’re not getting married or
anything This thing with me and
Jeff It doesn’t have to change
anything

She steps toward him reaching out her hands --

CURT
It already has

Curt gets up and gathers his pile of wood and walks BACK TO
CAMP Lynn is starting tear up

LYNN
Curt

He doesn’t turn around Disappears into the woods

Lynn starts to CRY Then stops herself Looks in the
direction he went --

LYNN
You could have called You could
have come to visit me

She wipes her eyes

LYNN
Fucking men

EXT PINE GROVE - NIGHT

Sparks from the FIRE float up into the night Curt watches
them as they fade out below a canopy of pine branches and
stars Lynn and Jeff sit across the fire from him No one
speaks

Lynn stares at Curt for a moment and then reaches into her
bag

LYNN
I was saving this for the top of
our climb but I think we could use
it right now
(no response)
I know I could

She pulls out a JOINT and holds it in the fire to light it
Takes a big drag on it and holds it Offers it to Jeff

JEFF
Is that a good idea I mean don’t
they give you guys drug tests

LYNN
Not until September It’1ll be out
of my system by then

He takes the joint from her She waves for Curt to come
closer He hesitates then sits down next to her She passes
the joint over to him

CURT
No that’s cool I

LYNN
C’mon We need to chill out if
we’re gonna get through this

Curt nods and inhales As he exhales Lynn leans in close and
sucks in his smoke almost KISSING him Jeff stares at them
He puts his hand on her shoulder and turns her toward him
Breathes in her exhale

Curt lays against on his backpack and watches the STARS
twinkle as the pot starts to take effect

SOME TIME LATER

Curt’s eyes are a little red He takes one more hit and
passes the joint back to Lynn He’s still looking up at the
night sky Realizes Lynn hasn’t taken the joint out of his
hand He looks over and sees her making out with Jeff

He watches them with groggy eyes Lynn turns as if she
sensed him watching She passes the joint to Jeff and sidles
over to Curt

With her back turned to Jeff she takes Curt’s hand - and
puts his finger in her mouth He’s not sure how to react She
smiles at him and pulls away turning back to make out with
Jeff some more

Curt closes his eyes

SOME TIME LATER - VIEW FROM THE TREES ABOVE

SOMEONE is up in the trees staring down at --

CURT Sleeping by the dwindling fire

Curt WAKES UP Sees that Jeff and Lynn aren’t next to him
anymore A thick MIST hangs in the night air
He hears NOISES coming from their tent
It’s the sound of Lynn and Jeff having sex Curt rolls over
pulling a sleeping bag over his head - trying not to listen
INT LYNN AND JEFF’S TENT - CONTINUOUS
Jeff and Lynn are going at it in their tent As it starts to
get noisier she puts a pillow over her mouth to cover the

sound

Jeff stares outside in the direction of Curt and tears the
pillow away letting her CRIES echo around the campsite

FADE TO

EXT PINE GROVE - BEFORE DAWN

It’s still a few hours before sunrise The mist has lifted
and a few stars are visible in the dark PRE-DAWN SKY

Lynn gets out of her tent Starts unzipping her pants
heading for the trees to pee Something makes her look up --

She SCREAMS

The twisted DEAD FACE of the Old Fisherman stares down at
her His body lies across the tree branches above

INT TENT - CONTINUOUS

Jeff awakes to the sound of Lynn SCREAMING He scrambles out
of the tent

OUTSIDE

Curt is awake now too He and Jeff follow Lynn’s gaze up into
the trees

The WIDE-EYED CORPSE of an old man stares down at them

Then they see two more MANGLED BODIES All of them wearing
hunting gear soaked through blood from countless stab
wounds

All three of the hunter’s bodies are draped through the
branches in the trees above limbs dangling like grisly
marionettes

Lynn grabs onto Jeff still screaming Curt scrambles for a
FLASHLIGHT and flips it on

Light does not help the situation They can see the blood
soaked bodies more clearly now

Curt casts the light into the WOODS around them looking for
more danger Jeff is trying to gather up their gear

Lynn pulls on Curt now trying to get him to run --

LYNN
C’mon

JEFF
What the fuck happened to them

CURT
We gotta move

Jeff gives up on the tents and sweeps up the BACKPACKS full
of money Lynn helps him as Curt slings on their bag of
CLIMBING GEAR

EXT CRAGGY HILLSIDE - MORNING

The SUN has risen and Curt Lynn and Jeff are RUNNING with
their backpacks up a rough ROCKY INCLINE

JEFF

We left all our food back there
CURT

A couple of days without food won’t

kill us

Curt regrets saying “kill us” as soon as it slips out

LYNN
Whoever murdered them it has to
have something to do with the
money

JEFF

But what kind of sick fuck would
leave them like that

CURT
Somebody who didn’t want them found
right away but didn’t want to take
the time to bury them

They all double their efforts hauling their gear as fast as
they can

As they clear the incline - Curt points at their destination
An imposing CLIFF in the distance

In their immediate future however is a large OUTCROPPING of
rock that cuts across their path

Lynn reaches it first and grabs the top Her pack weighs her

down and she’s having trouble pulling herself up Jeff comes

up behind her and puts his hands on her butt Helps shove her
up high enough

Jeff joins her at the top of the rock Pulls her close for a
second and WHISPERS something reassuring in her ear She
nods Holds his hand as they move forward

Curt watches the little scene jealousy welling up inside
Jeff is smiling He happens to look back as he scales the
boulder and sees Curt’s withering GAZE

EXT BOTTOM OF CLIFF - DAY

The hot sun beats down on the three as they reach the bottom
of the HIGH CLIFF They’re sweaty and exhausted If this
cliff looked imposing from a distance up close it’s
positively menacing

CURT
We should tie off the bags and pull
them up after

Jeff nods They all get their climbing gear ready Curt puts
on his HARNESS

CURT
I’1l go up first and set the line

Jeff watches as Curt moves up closer to the cliff slinging a
ROPE over his shoulder

JEFF
Why should you go first

Curt gives him a look

JEFF (cont’d)
You think you’re the best climber

Jeff walks to the base of the cliff ready to start He
glares at Curt as if to say “Let’s see you prove it” Curt is
not about to back down He takes a position a few yards away

LYNN
Jesus Christ You two need to grow
up

CURT

(locking eyes with Jeff)
Let’s do it Say the word

JEFF
Go for it

Jeff grabs the wall and starts CLIMBING So does Curt
Despite what she said earlier Lynn watches with interest

Up on the CLIFF Curt and Jeff are both skilled at this and
they make good progress Frequently they look over at one
another hoping to take the lead

But Jeffs obviously been practicing He’s going to be the
first to the TOP

Curt is scrambling to close the distance - then his hand
SLIPS A few pieces of loose rock fall away as he barely gets
another hand hold

He settles himself down and starts climbing more safely
Jeff looks down triumphant He has won the race and is the
first to reach the SUMMIT Stops gloating long enough to
lower a long ROPE for Lynn to tie the bags off on

Curt is getting close to the top Lynn is beginning her
climb Jeff stands at the summit monitoring her progress

JEFF

You’re extending too much
LYNN

(barely audible below)

Uh huh
Jeff watches some more shaking his head
JEFF
Move to your right there are some

easier holds there

Lynn is frustrated but doesn’t say anything She reaches for
a hold but misses and DROPS down a foot

JEFF
Whoa C’mon Lynn focus

CURT
Why don’t you let her do something
for herself for once You’re not
her coach

Jeff glares at Curt

JEFF
Why don’t you mind your own
business

Curt looks down at Lynn but if he was expecting any backup
he won’t get it

She stares up at him angry that he sold her out It’s
obvious to Jeff now that Lynn was talking to Curt behind his
back

Curt has a few difficult yards left before he reaches the
summit

Lynn isn’t in the mood to climb any more and lets Jeff
basically pull her up

AT THE TOP

Curt is at the summit Jeff stands over him and offers him
his hand When Curt takes it --

JEFF
You know what Curt Stay the hell
away from my girlfriend

Curt angrily lets go of Jeff’s hand Gets up over the edge by
himself as Jeff continues to help Lynn climb up

She arrives on the scene to find the two GLARING at each
other They only break their gaze when it’s time to bring the
backpacks up to the top

No one speaks as they sling their backpacks on and get ready
to move out Lynn marches on ahead of both of them wanting
no part of this

FADE TO

EXT SHOAL CLIFF - NIGHT

Miller is standing over the BUSTED CANOE looking up the
cliff He’s been running all night and looks exhausted He
pulls out a bottle of AMPHETAMINES and takes one

Shaking off his fatigue he sizes up the cliff and makes
ready to climb up in the pitch black

A low RUMBLE of thunder is audible in the distance

EXT ROCKY FOREST CAMPSITE - LATE NIGHT

A flash of LIGHTNING arcs through the night sky illuminating
CURT’S FACE for a brief second

He’s awake huddled in a lean-to of pine branches He turns
on his side trying to get comfortable Without a tent or a
sleeping bag it’s not easy

He peeks out to where the backpacks have been stashed
Against a tree covered with brush

RAIN starts to fall The forest comes alive with NOISES as
the heavy drops hit the foliage The shower soon escalates
into a torrential DOWNPOUR

Curt pulls the hood of his jacket over his head The rain is
coming down so hard he can barely see the backpacks anymore

As another FLASH runs across the sky he sees --
JEFF

By the backpacks He grabs one of them looks around
suspiciously and then walks back to the PINE LEAN-TO where
he and Lynn are sheltered

Curt watches him carefully Then he too gets out of his
cover and walks over to --

THE BACKPACKS

Curt kneels down Grabs his pack and looks over toward Jeff
and Lynn’s lean-to Lynn is stirring underneath her cover
but Jeffs gone

Curt spins around - and there’s JEFF right behind him Curt
is startled but quickly composes himself Stands up throws
his backpack on and marches back to his lean-to

Curt lays down huddling with his pack Looks over to the
other lean-to

And there’s Jeff sitting beside Lynn both of them staring
at Curt She has pulled in her backpack as well Jeff
WHISPERS something in Lynn’s ear as she pulls her backpack
closer

Another FLASH blinds Curt for a moment and when he can see
again both of them are laying down shielding themselves from
the rain and trying to sleep

EXT ROCKY HILLSIDE - RAINY MORNING

It’s POURING The three companions trudge along hungry and
soaking wet Feeling the weight of their bags with every
step

No one speaks They stare straight ahead Any fun they were
having on this trip and any excitement about finding the
money seem to have washed away a long time ago

Curt is a few steps back as Lynn and Jeff walk together ahead
of him He looks over his shoulder when he hears a low rumble
of THUNDER There is a flash of LIGHTNING And maybe
something else

A MAN Just for a second It looked like someone
silhouetted against the sky

There it is again Someone is definitely moving among the
trees far up the slope

CURT
Guys look You see that

Jeff and Lynn squint into the rain Jeff sees it too

JEFF
Yeah Somebody’s walking down this
way

LYNN

He’s not walking He’s running

They all instantly have the same realization - HE’S COMING
FOR HIS MONEY

CURT
Shit C’mon

Curt leads them now as they move as quick as they can to get
away from --

EXT UP THE HILLSIDE - SAME TIME

The MAN running toward the three shapes in the distance --

MILLER

Soaking wet and determined His one blood-filled eye makes
his gaze seem that much more intense

EXT ROCKY RAVINE - MINUTES LATER

Lynn keeps looking behind them for Miller as Jeff ties a ROPE
to their backpacks Curt gives Jeff a hand --

They quickly lower the bags down a STEEP RAVINE Lynn has a
climbing rope ready

Each one loops the rope around themselves and they hop over
the edge RAPPELLING down one by one they reach the bottom
of the ravine safely It’s quite a ride but they’re in no
mood to enjoy it

Jeff looks at their ROPE now tied off at the top of the
ravine

JEFF
We just left him a way down

Curt looks up the rope Then he takes off his pack and hands
it to Jeff

CURT
You guys go ahead I’1l1 catch up

LYNN
What are you

CURT
Just go

Lynn and Jeff grab their packs and tear off in the direction
of a nearby stream

WITH CURT

He’s CLIMBING back up the rope When he gets halfway up the
ravine he grabs onto the rocks and CUTS the rope He keeps
an eye out for any sign of Miller as he FREE CLIMBS back down
as fast as he can

When he’s close enough to the bottom he JUMPS the rest of
the way to the ground - then takes off RUNNING
EXT JAGGED RAPIDS - MOMENTS LATER

Curt catches up to the others They’ve stopped at a STREAM
blocking their path

The water has risen here swollen by the torrential rain The
babbling brook has turned into a RAGING RAPID

JAGGED STONES jut out from the water Trying to get across
looks like suicide Jeff looks at Curt --

JEFF
You think it’s his money You think
he’s coming after us

Curt is looking behind them Watching for --
MILLER

He appears at the edge of the cliff Backs away from it then
takes a running start

Miller LEAPS off the edge of the cliff barely reaching the
top of a tall TREE that stands twenty feet away

He half climbs half crashes down through the tree toward the
ground

CURT
(pointing)
Yeah he’s coming after us all
right

The three of them run along the edge of the water until they
see it --

A LOG BRIDGE

A tree has recently fallen across the water It shifts
slightly in the rapids Jeff is the first one to the LOG
BRIDGE He scrambles onto it but the way it’s moving makes
him hesitate

LYNN
Jeff
CURT
(fierce)
Move

Jeff starts making his way across Lynn is behind him
practically pushing him to the other side

Curt is the last one to go across and the tree DRIFTS
SUDDENLY from a big rush of water Jeff and Lynn try to
steady it but they can’t hold back the momentum of the
swollen stream

Curt is near the end of the tree trunk as it starts to ROLL --

He SLIPS OFF hitting the surging water a few feet from
shore

Jeff dives forward and GRABS his hand With Lynn’s help he
manages to pull Curt to safety

All three are now on the other side as MILLER comes into
view He stares intently at them as he nears the water They
get a good look at his face realizing that they’ve seen it
before - the nightmare from the fog

Curt throws himself against the tree bridge

CURT
Push

The others join and manage to DISLODGE the fallen tree from
the rocks It turns perpendicular to the stream and WASHES
AWAY trapping Miller on the other side

MILLER
(intense)
Just drop the money

Curt fingers the strap of his bag Suddenly Lynn runs off
into the trees

CURT
Wait

Curt and Jeff have no choice but to follow her Miller grits
his teeth as they disappear into the woods

And there he stands in the rain Out in the middle of a
million acres of wilderness and without his money Hell no
He’s not giving up now

He studies the RAPIDS A man would be crazy to try and get
across

He runs upstream a short way until he finds the spot that
looks the least deadly - And THROWS HIMSELF IN
EXT PINE FOREST - SAME TIME

Curt and Jeff catch up to Lynn who’s RUNNING through the
forest

JEFF
Lynn Wait

She slows down a little Perhaps to let them catch up
perhaps just from exhaustion
CURT
This is crazy Let’s just give him
the money It’s not worth it

LYNN
If we give him the money hell kill
us anyway

CURT
You saw that guy You really think
were gonna get away from him

LYNN
Maybe he won’t be able to cross the
rapids

JEFF
Maybe Did you see him do his
Superman routine off the cliff

LYNN
We can’t just give him our money

CURT
(interrupting)
Lynn It’s not our money

LYNN
It’s not his either

Curt grabs her by her shoulders

CURT
It’s not about the money It’s
about our lives

Lynn is shaking Tears welling up in her eyes

CURT (cont’d)
You put us all in jeopardy We
could have ended it Got away
clean We still have lives to go
back to

LYNN
I don’t
(off their looks)
I lost my scholarship

Jeff is shocked

JEFF
What

Lynn bursts into tears

LYNN
I lost it I don’t have it anymore

JEFF
What did you do

Lynn doesn’t answer Jeffs not willing to let up

JEFF (cont’d)
What did you do You failed a drug
test didn’t you They got you for
smoking pot I told you youd get
caught and you went and did it
anyway

LYNN
Fuck you Jeff I didn’t smoke any
pot all year

JEFF
Well then -

LYNN
HGH okay That’s what I took
Because if I so much as lose a
tenth of a second I don’t just lose
a race I lose my scholarship I
lose my whole life

JEFF
And it happened anyway

LYNN
And that’s why I’m keeping this
money

CURT

It doesn’t matter

JEFF
What do you mean it doesn-

CURT
Because she’s right This guy’s
going to kill us no matter what we
do So we either stick together and
escape from this place or we’re
dead

They both look at Curt and they know he’s right Lynn nods
she’s ready to get moving again They start through the
WOODS

CURT
We have to assume he’1ll find a way
across the water You can run Lynn
If you get out ahead of us don’t
look back Well find you

JEFF
(re their surroundings)
I recognize this

CURT
And if it comes down to it you’d
better be ready to drop that
backpack No matter what you’re
thinking right now it’s not worth
dying for

Jeff comes to a halt

JEFF
Guys wait I’ve been here before

They stop and look - He’s pointing at a MOUNTAIN a few miles
away

JEFF (contd)
You see that notch in the mountain
If you go to ground level straight
below it there’s a hidden cave It
cuts right through the side of the
mountain If we go through and he
has to go around we’d get a day’s
jump on him

EXT PINE TRAIL - LATER

Jeff leads them toward the MOUNTAIN Curt walks to the rear
occasionally looking back They’re all nervous

Jeff moves some brush aside carefully holds it until the
others pass and then lets it swing back slowly They’re
trying to be as silent as they can
Curt looks back one more time --
CURT
(hushed)
Shit

They all stop Curt whips out and adjusts a pair of
BINOCULARS

CURT’S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS

He’s looking at a few bushes shaking up on a crest Then more
movement farther down And then filling his whole field of
view --

MILLER Heading straight for them soaked and bloody clothes
torn up from --

CURT
He got through the rapids

LYNN
Shit
CURT
(harsh whisper)
Go Gol

They all run for the mountain It’s still a ways off

JEFF
How close is he

CURT
Just go go

They grip the straps on their backpacks and run as fast as
they can no longer concerned about making noise Lynn takes
the lead

The terrain is rough here HILLS and DITCHES make running
with the heavy packs even more difficult Lynn is showing her
athleticism and really starts to put some space between
herself and the guys

As they traverse pine groves and gullies they lose sight of
her

LYNN

She’s obviously done some cross country running in addition
to track And if her coaches could see her they’d be
impressed She seems to move effortlessly through the trees

Finally she looks back There’s no one there She can HEAR
Curt and Jeff running somewhere off behind her At least she
assumes it’s still Curt and Jeff She’s not going to wait
around to find out

She looks through the trees at the NOTCH in the mountain and
keeps going Occasionally looking back for signs of the
others as she runs And that’s why she doesn’t see --

A STEEP RAVINE

Lynn turns and looks a second too late she SLIPS down the
edge of the RAVINE her heavy pack makes her tumble down the
side even faster

EXT STEEP RAVINE - CONTINUOUS

Fifty feet down a STEEP SLOPE Lynn rolls over the rocks and
brush finally coming to a halt against an outcropping of

stone at the bottom

She isn’t moving

EXT PINE TRAIL - MOMENTS LATER
If Lynn could see up the ravine she would see Curt and Jeff

skirt the top of it as they run oblivious to her fall They
bypass the ravine and keep on course for the mountain

EXT CAVE ENTRANCE - SOON AFTER

Curt and Jeff have reached the foot of this small mountain
The sprint with heavy packs has taken a toll

CURT
(out of breath)
Where’s Lynn

Jeff is too winded to speak He hunches over trying to catch
his breath Points to a cluster of BUSHES --

JEFF
Maybe she went inside

He pulls the bushes aside and reveals the entrance to a CAVE
Curt peers inside

CURT
(loud whisper)
Lynn

They take a few steps inside shining FLASHLIGHTS

EXT STEEP RAVINE - SAME TIME

Lynn still lies in a heap at the bottom of the slope Far
above her --

MILLER peers over the edge He sees her and starts to CLIMB
DOWN

Descending he grabs on to some saplings avoiding the kind
of tumble that Lynn took
LYNN

Opens her eyes groggy HEARS something above Turns over and
sees --

MILLER - only a few yards away
She rises to her feet adrenaline kicking in - and tears off

into the woods Branches whip against her face as she RUNS
WILDLY

BEHIND HER
Miller let’s himself slide down the rest of the way He lands

on his feet and gives chase immediately From behind his back
he unsheathes his LARGE KNIFE

EXT CAVE ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Curt and Jeff are behind the bushes that conceal the cave
opening Curt scans with the binoculars

CURT
I’m going out there to look

JEFF
Wait Don’t If he sees us come out
of here If we reveal the

entrance to him she won’t have any
place to hide Give her a chance
Wait another minute

Curt bites his lip and keeps a lookout with the binoculars

EXT PINE TRAIL -— CONTINUOUS

Lynn is no longer running like a champion She’s running for
her life The fall down the ravine didn’t help matters
Tired hungry and panicked she struggles to run with the
heavy backpack on

Miller is GETTING CLOSER He has his big knife at the ready --
AND THROWS IT
It skims a tree trunk right next to Lynn’s head She hears

the CLANG as it takes a chunk out of bark and falls into the
brush

The SOUND is like a starter pistol for her Her speed seems
to double desperation and fear driving her legs harder than
she ever thought possible

Miller runs past where his knife glanced off the tree He
hesitates but it’s LOST somewhere in the brush No time to
look for it He continues the pursuit angrier than ever

But up ahead Lynn is starting to pull away from him His
eyes widen a bit He wasn’t expecting that

EXT CAVE ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Curt and Jeff nervously scan the surrounding WOODS Curt has
the binoculars

CURT
I see her She’s running this way
and he’s right behind her

Jeff pulls the binoculars away and looks for himself

JEFF
She’s looking around

Then it sinks in --

CURT
She can’t see the cave

Curt isn’t sure what to do He doesn’t have much time to
decide

CURT
I have to get her in here

JEFF
What What are you doing

Curt slips out of the cave carefully stepping on patches of
rock so that he doesn’t leave any footprints He hides in
some nearby BUSHES

Jeff desperately tries to find Lynn again with the
binoculars

JEFFS POV

Lynn is a good distance ahead of Miller running up sharp
INCLINES and weaving in and out of thick GROVES OF TIMBER

Suddenly Miller takes a nasty FALL --

EXT PINE PATH - CONTINUOUS

Miller tumbles on the ground does a quick roll and springs
back up ready to continue his chase But something’s not
right He’s LIMPING

He swears at himself under his breath and starts to run
again using sheer willpower to overcome the pain

EXT NEARBY CAVE ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Lynn reaches the area of the cave looking around
desperately She has to stifle a scream when CURT suddenly
pops his head out -

CURT
(hissing)
Lynn Step on the rocks
She follows his instructions leaving no tracks as she makes

her way inside the BUSHES He grabs her and practically
TACKLES her to the ground pulling her out of view

INT JUST INSIDE THE CAVE - SAME TIME
Jeff peers out at --

MILLER

He’s coming closer Sweaty Angry He’s slowing to a jog now
looking around trying to figure out where she went

Jeff also sees --
CURT AND LYNN

They’re LYING DOWN behind some nearby bushes If Miller gets
a little closer he’1ll spot them for sure

Jeff swallows hard He pulls a JACKKNIFE out of his pocket
and clicks open the blade Then he looks out at Miller

He’s big and menacing with ferocity in his eyes as he hunts
for Lynn Jeff closes his eyes and PUTS AWAY his little
knife

He slumps to the floor of the cave and starts to cry He
happens to look over at Curt’s bag and sees a glint of
something It’s the SWISS ARMY KNIFE with Lynn’s monogram on
it

The crying doesn’t stop But his expression changes as he
stares at the MONOGRAM and the wheels of his mind start to
turn

OUTSIDE

Miller whips out a MAP Studies it and then hurries past
Curt and Lynn tracking her likely path AROUND THE MOUNTAIN

Curt breathes a sigh of relief as he and Lynn get up and join
Jeff in the blackness of the CAVE

INT CAVE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

Jeff jumps back as Curt and Lynn come in But then sees who
it is

JEFF
Jesus You made it

Jeff wipes his eyes eager to conceal the fact that he’d been
crying Curt doesn’t notice that Lynn’s MONOGRAMMED KNIFE is
no longer among his things as he gathers up his bag

Jeff quickly motions for them to follow him --
FARTHER IN

Water runs down the cold sandstone walls The SOUND of
DRIPPING WATER on rock is everywhere

Safely away from the opening they click on their FLASHLIGHTS
to illuminate their path as Jeff leads the way

LYNN
(to Jeff)
You sure about this

JEFF
Positive My cousin and I went
through it twice

Jeff moves off ahead All light from the entrance fades away
behind them Lynn brings up the rear frequently shining her
light behind them to check for Miller

INT HIGH CORRIDOR - LATER
The three are making their way through a v-shaped corridor of

wet rock Their small flashlights don’t reach very far into
the blackness

Suddenly Jeff stops Curt stumbles into him --

JEFF
Whoa

Jeffs flashlight tumbles into a BLACK HOLE beneath his feet
He gingerly takes a step back

CURT
Don’t move Lynn

LYNN
What’s up

Curt and Jeff back up a little Curt shines his flashlight on
the floor - they’ve come to the edge of a VOID

JEFF
There used to be a rope bridge
here I guess it’s gone

Curt gives him a look - ‘no shit’ They shine their lights
ahead but can’t see the other side of the chasm nor can
they see the bottom

LYNN
Now what

JEFF
We’re screwed Without a rope
across I don’t

CURT
One of us will have to take a rope
across Free climb along this wall
here How far is it to the other
side

Jeff stands up but as he takes a step toward the edge he
halts He’s still shaken up from nearly falling to his death
in the dark

JEFF
I don’t remember

CURT
Jeff How far is it

JEFF
(snapping out of it)
A hundred feet Give or take

Curt nods Looks at Jeff leaning weakly against the wall
Turns to Lynn

CURT
Put a rope around my waist I’ll
tie it off once I get to the other
side

Lynn is looking at the WET WALL near them shining the
flashlight to look for hand holds Not many She looks at
Jeff He winces Starts to slump down to the floor again
Shame welling up inside of him

He sees Lynn start to tie a rope around Curt

JEFF
No I should go

They look over at him He stands up with new determination
He takes Lynn’s flashlight

JEFF
I can do it

OVER THE PIT - SOON AFTER

Jeff is spread eagle against the wall of the cavern Inching
his way across

He relies on the others to shine some light ahead of him
aware that just below his feet unseen is a DEADLY VOID

Sweat from his forehead drips down like the rivulets of
water coming down the cave wall - making every new HAND HOLD
a deadly gamble

When it seems like he’s been climbing forever --

JEFF
I should be almost there

He has gone into almost complete blackness now their
flashlights can’t illuminate any farther from the edge
behind Jeff reaches out his left hand - and it SLIPS

The shift in weight causes his whole body to come off the
wall Lynn hears it and SCREAMS

But they hear a quick GRUNT from Jeff He was over to the
other side A faint point of LIGHT appears from Jeff turning
on the flashlight in the dark up ahead

JEFF
(shouting back)
I went past it by about ten feet I
can see where to tie the rope off

Jeff starts to anchor one of the climbing ropes He pauses

hearing Curt and Lynn TALKING somewhere off in the dark It

even sounds like they might be laughing He can’t quite make
out what’s being said

He shines the flashlight in their direction but the light
doesn’t reach The conversation stops

JEFF
(yelling to them)
Hey guys We should test the rope
Why don’t you put the bags across
first

INT THE FIRST SIDE OF THE PIT - LATER

Curt stands at the edge of the pit The money has already
gone across to the other side Lynn is currently fading from
view as she shimmies across the rope

Curt watches the rope vibrate until it stops Indicating that
she reached the other side

LYNN (0S)
(shouting)
Okay your turn

OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE
Lynn is watching the ROPE shake a little as Curt starts

coming across to join them Jeff is pulling something out of
his backpack

JEFF
Maybe now you want to tell me about
this

LYNN

What are you

Jeff waves the MONOGRAMMED SWISS ARMY KNIFE in her face And
then THROWS it down into the abyss

LYNN
What the hell are you doing

JEFF
I was going to ask you that

LYNN
Is this some kind of a joke

JEFF
Does it look like I’m joking

CURT

Is making his journey across Arm over arm into the
blackness He can’t see anything as he hangs under the rope
He hears Lynn and Jeff though ARGUING in hushed tones

Now it’s his turn to be paranoid He stops moving on the rope
for a second and the voices cease Then he catches a snippet
of something Lynn saying something to Jeff He can’t hear
what it was but she sounded angry

It’s hard to make out because of the ECHOES in the cave But
he HEARS --

LYNN
--- Don’t Just don’t

Curt starts shimmying down the rope as fast as he can
ON THE FAR SIDE

The argument seems to have ended Lynn is sitting down
against the cave wall getting the bags of money ready to
move again She isn’t paying attention to Jeff Maybe she
should be --

Jeff is squatting near the rope He watches it twitch as Curt
makes his crossing Jeff has his JACKKNIFE out and he lowers
it menacingly toward the rope as he glares out at Curt -
unseen in the dark

He looks over at Lynn and the money then the rope Still
thinking

WITH CURT

He can see their FLASHLIGHTS now JEFF is standing at the
edge of the pit staring down at him

CURT
Guys What’s going on

Curt’s eyes go wide as he sees that Jeff has a KNIFE in his
hand

But when Curt reaches the end Jeff steps aside and Lynn helps
him to his feet Curt keeps his eyes on the POCKETKNIFE

And watches as Jeff uses it to cut the ropes across the
chasm Curt doesn’t let the others see his big sigh of
relief

JEFF
If he does manage to follow us in
here Id like to see him try to
get across

They throw their gear on and get moving again Curt coils up
a length of rope and puts it over his shoulder

CURT
One rope left
(he turns to Lynn)
What was going on with -

JEFF
Just stay out of it
(walks ahead)
It shouldn’t be too much farther
now

EXT FOOTHILLS OF THE MOUNTAIN - DAY

Miller is trudging through the rain and mud making his way
around the mountain

He limps along with a makeshift SPLINT on his BAD LEG Still
moving quickly

With shaking hands he pulls out the bottle of PILLS and
takes the last couple of amphetamines

INT UNDERGROUND RESERVOIR - SOME TIME LATER

The largest CHAMBER in the cave There is light here From
the ceiling high above their heads a few small openings let
in shafts of SUNLIGHT from the surface

They also are letting in a DELUGE of rainwater Jeff is the
first one to enter

JEFF
Shit

Curt and Lynn are right behind him They see what he’s
looking at Sunlight reflecting off a huge POOL OF WATER The
chamber is mostly FLOODED

LYNN
Let me guess -

JEFF
Yeah The exit’s down there

LYNN
Maybe we should go back

CURT
We can’t go back

LYNN
(to Jeff)
I can’t believe you led us in here
CURT
And he’s going to get us out too

Right

He puts a reassuring hand on Jeffs shoulder Jeff tries to
muster his courage He takes his pack off Gets ready to jump
in the water

JEFF
(gives a nod to Curt)
Be right back

He takes a deep breath and DIVES down flashlight in his
teeth Curt and Lynn watch as the light fades out under the
dark water

It’s a tense wait before Jeff finally splashes back to the
surface

JEFF
I found the exit tunnel It slants
upwards so it’s only partly
flooded But it’s going to be a
tight fit

Curt looks up at the water still POURING into the cave
CURT
Well it’s only going to get worse
Wed better hurry
UNDERGROUND RESERVOIR - SOON AFTER

Within a few minutes they have their gear tied off to the
rope Jeff DIVES first taking the end of the rope with him

MOVING UNDERWATER
The FLASHLIGHT barely lights a few feet ahead in the murky

water The exit is a nearly invisible opening far below the
surface Jeff CRAWLS IN

BACK ABOVE

Curt puts his hand on the rope leading underwater takes a
deep breath and SUBMERGES

UNDERWATER

Curt slides his hand on the rope until it leads him to the
EXIT His eyes go wide - This is going to be even tighter
than he expected

INT CAVE EXIT SHAFT - CONTINUOUS

Curt is crawling up a forty-five degree inclined TUNNEL If
it weren’t claustrophobic enough it’s also completely filled
with water

He moves frantically upward almost out of air Finally his
head breaks the surface of the water and he sucks in a big
breath Jeff calls from somewhere up ahead --

JEFF (0S)
You out

CURT
Yeah

JEFF (0S)
We should get some light farther
up
(beat)
God Oh God

CURT
What is it

JEFF (0S)
It’s tighter up here It’s getting
smaller

Curt notices it too He’s completely out of the water now
but the tunnel seems to be getting NARROWER as he crawls
higher It’s a claustrophobic’s ultimate nightmare

CURT
Just relax You’ve gone out this
way before

JEFF (0S)
(barely audible)
Uh huh

Curt tried to sound reassuring but as he feels the WALLS
close in he’s close to losing it himself

Farther up SUNLIGHT from outside starts to creep in It’s
reassuring at first but it also reveals just how tight
things are going to get

CURT
Oh God

He closes his eyes and presses on He’s flat on his stomach
now wriggling his way forward The rope he’s following is
twitching now It might be Lynn coming up from below

He can see Jeff’s feet up ahead

CURT
Jeff
No answer
CURT
Jeff
JEFF
- Yeah

Curt breathes a sigh of relief At least he’s not
unconscious or worse

CURT
Are you stuck

Curt can almost touch Jeff’s feet now His BREATHING starts
to get panicked again If Jeff is stuck they’re all dead

CURT
Jeff can you hear me

JEFF
- Yeah

CURT
Listen I’m going to push on your
feet and then I want you to crawl
forward okay

JEFF
- Yeah

Curt puts his hands out and pushes against the bottoms of
Jeffs FEET He starts to move forward He wasn’t stuck just
having a panic attack

Curt mumbles a silent prayer to himself as the two of them
continue forward

EXT CAVE EXIT - DAY

From a concealed crevice on the side of a wall of stone two
HANDS EMERGE into daylight Jeff pulls himself out into the
sun He’s pale and shaking

He flops to the ground as Curt’s head appears from out of the
shaft Curt breathes open air glad to be alive As he pulls
himself out he realizes --

CURT
Lynn

He sticks his head into the tunnel and yells --

CURT
Lynn

From somewhere far below he hears her GASP for air

CURT
Lynn Are you okay

A few GROANS are all he hears in response
DOWN IN THE TUNNEL
Lynn is just barely above the surface of the water She
stares up at the LIGHT at the end of the tunnel far away
Her LEFT ARM is folded under her body awkwardly
LYNN
I’m stuck My arm’s stuck I can’t
move
OUTSIDE THE TUNNEL
Curt and Jeff are listening with horror
CURT
(yelling inside)

Hang on to the rope

Curt HEAVES on the rope to try and pull her out but it
doesn’t budge

LYNN (0S)
It’s not working Help me

CURT
(to Jeff)
We have to get her out of there

Jeff is sitting on the ground shivering He looks up at
Curt

JEFF
I can’t go back in

Then from down in the tunnel the situation gets worse --

LYNN (0S)
The water’s rising Help me

JEFF
Oh God Oh God She’s gonna die

Curt starts tying a rope around his ankle

JEFF
I’m sorry I’m sorry

Curt grabs Jeff by the shoulders

CURT
No You got us through the cave
You did it It’s almost over But
not yet You have to help me now

Jeff looks up at him

CURT
When I tell you to I need you to
pull Can you do that

Jeff nods Curt takes a deep breath and starts climbing BACK
IN the tunnel

DOWN IN THE TUNNEL

Lynn’s head and shoulders are above water but the level is
RISING Suddenly the light shining down from above her is
OBSTRUCTED She freaks out and starts SCREAMING

CURT (0S)
Lynn it’s me I’m coming down to
get you

Lynn stops screaming The fact that the tunnel got darker
because Curt is coming to save her calms her down a bit

LYNN
I screwed myself Curt I came in
wrong and my arm is underneath me

CURT (0S)
(getting closer)
Can you back up a little and get
unstuck

The water is up to Lynn’s NECK now She shakes her head
starting to sob

LYNN
I’1l1 drown

Curt can see her now lit by the flashlight He sees the
water RISING

LYNN
Don’t let me drown

CURT
Listen to me I want you reach out
your free hand

She does He’s inching closer The water is close to her
mouth

LYNN
Hurry

CURT
I’m coming But you’re going to
have to hold your breath in a
second okay If you go underwater
don’t panic I’m going to pull you
out

She nods Starting to hyperventilate a little The water is
up to her mouth as she tries to take a deep breath She
COUGHS and sputters it out

Focusing she closes her mouth and takes a deep breath
through her nose just before the water covers that too

Curt finally reaches her outstretched hand Lynn’s whole head
is UNDERWATER

He grabs her HAND and she grips him as tight as she can her
arm shaking

CURT
Pull Jeff

Nothing

CURT
PULL

Just as Curt is about to scream again he feels the rope go
taut Jeff starts pulling them out Then --

Curt’s shoulder SNAGS on a jagged edge of rock It TEARS
through his skin as Jeff pulls harder

Lynn’s head is still under water

CURT
(wincing with pain)
Keep pulling

Curt manages to hold on to Lynn despite the pain Her head
finally EMERGES from the water

She can breathe again

CURT
I’ve got her Keep pulling

EXT CAVE EXIT - SOON AFTER

Curt collapses out of the end of the tunnel Both he and Jeff
help pull Lynn to safety She HUGS Curt crying

CURT
You’re okay now

Lynn doesn’t want to let go She CLINGS to Curt crying as he
grabs the rope and starts pulling their bags up out of the
tunnel

JEFF
I’m sorry Lynn I couldn’t do it I
couldn’t go back in I tried I
just

She’s not even looking at him He sits on the ground and
stares off into space

JEFF
(to himself)
I couldn’t save you I’m always
useless

EXT FOREST TRAIL - DAY
It’s RAINING but not as bad as before It doesn’t matter

much since they’re all SOAKED from diving through the
underwater cave

Curt has his shirt off Lynn has their meager FIRST-AID KIT
open trying to do something to help his SHOULDER WOUND She
has a bandage on it and starts wrapping tape around his arm

LYNN
Does that hurt

CURT
Only when you touch it

Jeff looks on He sees the way she’s looking at Curt The way
she’s touching his hand As Jeff stands over them a shiver
runs through him Maybe it’s from the cold rain More likely
it’s something else

Curt stands up and checks his WATCH
CURT

If we can keep moving I don’t think
there’s any way he can catch up

LYNN
We should be out of here by
tomorrow

JEFF

So I guess he’s out of the picture
Nothing else to worry about Just
us and our money One big happy
family

Curt ignores him and starts them moving again

EXT HIGH TRAIL - DAY

The rain has finally STOPPED The three companions are making
their way up a hill It’s slow going

Finally as they reach the top Jeff drops down and FLOPS
onto his back

CURT
What is it

JEFF
I need to rest

Lynn sets down beside him

CURT
We should try to keep going

Lynn looks up at him It’s not just the physical exhaustion
Mentally they’ve been through the ringer She shakes her
head

Curt’s too restless to sit down with them He looks farther
up the TRAIL --

CURT
I’m going to head up a little and
get a look around Make sure he’s
not coming up behind us somehow

JEFF
And we’re going to sit here and
wait until you get back

CURT
Yeah

JEFF
Why don’t you leave your backpack
then You’1l move faster without
it

CURT
You think it’s all about the money

JEFF
Prove me wrong

He throws his BACKPACK down in front of Jeff

CURT
Here’s how much I still care about
this damn money

JEFF
Bullshit You want it more than any
of us Cause you need it more than
any of us And if that had been
your five hundred grand that had
fallen in the river you would have
gotten it

Curt starts walking up the path

CURT
You know what dick You want that
five hundred Go ahead and take it
out of my bag while I’m up there
looking out for our asses

LYNN
Curt Wait
Curt shakes his head and walks up toward the RIDGE Lynn
turns to Jeff

LYNN
You’re being an asshole

JEFF
You can’t see through this You
don’t see what he’s trying to do

LYNN
What could he possibly be trying to
do

Jeff gestures to Lynn and himself

JEFF
This He’s trying to turn us
against each other

LYNN
Shut up I’m done I don’t want to
hear about any more of your ideas
or your plans or your delusions

JEFF
And don’t think I haven’t seen
what’s going on between you two
The way you’ve been looking at each
other

LYNN
He pulled me out of the cave Not
you He did

JEFF
Because you were blocking the
money Are you really that blind
If we couldn’t get you out of there
he wouldn’t be able to pull out his
money Don’t you see that

LYNN
And then he just leaves it here and
walks off

JEFF

Open your eyes It’s because he’s
trying to turn you against me

LYNN
No Jeff you’re doing a good job of
that all by yourself

She walks away and sits down against a nearby TREE

JEFF
How long did I have Lynn I mean
if we hadn’t found the money How
long was it going to be before you
told me you were moving back home
to be with Curt

She doesn’t look at him

JEFF
It’s nice to have one on deck huh
You lose your scholarship and all
of a sudden Owatonna’s not such a
bad place to be right Might as
well line up the next guy too
Especially when it can be a guy
youve already had

LYNN
What the hell are you talking
about

Jeff walks over to Curt’s backpack and zips it open Lynn
stays over by the tree refusing to look at him

He transfers FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND from Curt’s pack into his

JEFF
I’m talking about the fact that you
guys hooked up that night after the
junior prom

LYNN
What Where the hell’s that coming
from

JEFF
You gonna tell me something didn’t
happen

Lynn turns and gives him the finger Jeff shakes his head and
makes ready to leave

JEFF
Yeah well that’s it then You
two have fun

She hears him STOMP OFF into the woods but doesn’t turn to
watch him go

EXT HIGH RIDGE - SOON AFTER

Curt is lying prone on top of a RIDGE scanning below with
his BINOCULARS

CURT’S POV

Sweeping over seemingly endless patches of green Tracing
along TRAILS for signs of movement Something grabs his
attention - A SHAKING BUSH

Curt tries to focus on the MOTION Something moving through
the brush - Is it Miller

EXT RIDGE TRAIL - LATER

Jeffs face is still red with anger as he marches through the
wilderness He looks back once as if to check for Lynn
following behind She’s not

Keeps going forward until he hears --

A NOISE UP AHEAD

He stops Was it just his feet on the leaves that made that
sound or was it someone else He holds his breath listening
for the slightest

There it is again

FOOTSTEPS

SOMEONE is coming through the woods and heading his way He
starts breathing fast

He unslings his BACKPACK Sets it down out in the open Moves
behind a nearby TREE Footsteps getting closer now He picks
up a gnarled BRANCH Eyes trained on his backpack Using it
as bait

He’s starting to freak out now trying his best to
hyperventilate silently as the sound of movement is almost
right on top of him

Whoever it is they haven’t reached his backpack yet but
they seem to be heading right for it

Out of the corner of his eye SOMEONE emerges - and Jeff
pounces He swings the GNARLED BRANCH down on --

CURT

Who ROLLS AWAY from the attack shocked

CURT
Jesus

Jeff raises the branch again ready to bring it down on
Curt’s head Curt lunges for Jeffs knees and TACKLES him to
the ground

CURT
What the hell are you doing

Jeffs head hits the ground hard He’s dazed as he looks up
at Curt

JEFF
I thought you were the guy

Jeffs head lolls from side to side He’s looking at Curt
strangely It’s hard to tell what he might do next Curt
pulls the BRANCH out of his hands

CURT
Bullshit You saw it was me

Jeff looks up at Curt menacing him with the branch and
shakes his head Curt’s not sure what to make of it all He
steps back from Jeff a little

Jeff struggles to his feet Curt could take an easy shot
right now if he wanted to But instead he FLINGS the
makeshift club into the trees

CURT
What are you doing out this way
Where’s Lynn

JEFF
You guys are all teamed up now huh

CURT
What You’re nuts

JEFF
Am I You wanted her your whole
life And you couldn’t handle the
fact that she chose me

Jeff sees that he’s gotten to Curt a little Keeps going

JEFF
It was real easy back in high
school when I was just your wingman
huh Well you know what

(MORE)

JEFF (contd)
I’m the one that got out of
Owatanna I’m the one who’s got a
life and I’m the one that’s fucking
Lynn

Curt’s getting angry

CURT
You don’t love her do you You just
needed to finally be better than me
at something Didn’t you Jeff

Suddenly Jeff winds up and PUNCHES Curt right in the face
Curt staggers about to retaliate

But he stops himself Jeff has his fists up ready to go Red
and shaking

CURT (cont’d)
Is this what we’re gonna do now Is
this it Fuck this It’s stupid
Were all out here in this shit
together

JEFF
No

Jeff grabs his BACKPACK and puts it on

JEFF
Not anymore You guys wanted to
divide it all up Well fine Done
deal I’m taking my share

He starts walking away

CURT
Hey Just use your head for a
second We all still need to stick
together

JEFF
Why So you can keep pretending
that none of us have changed since
we were kids Like you’ve been
doing on this whole bullshit
camping trip

Curt just stands there staring as Jeff walks off into the
woods

EXT HIGH TRAIL - SOON AFTER

Curt RUNS back to where the others had been But there’s no
sign of Lynn or her gear He sees a note SCRAWLED in the
dirt

“C - LOOKING FOR YOU - L”

He sees that his BACKPACK full of money is still there
tucked out of sight in the bushes His eyes flit in every
direction not sure whether to go off looking for her or to
stay put hoping she’1ll return

Just then he hears a VOICE from somewhere in the distance A
voice that makes his blood run cold It’s MILLER

MILLER (0S)
I know can hear me out there The
game’s over You’re going to bring
me the rest of my money The ranger
cabin a mile North in one hour Or
I kill your friend

Curt is stunned Even more so when he hears the bushes RUSTLE
nearby and someone steps into the clearing with him --

LYNN
He runs up to her --

CURT
Thank God I thought -

They hear a horrible YELL from off in the woods It’s JEFF

EXT SOMEWHERE IN THE WOODS - CONTINUOUS

Miller stands over Jeff as he CRIES OUT in pain one more
time Miller’s twisting his arm behind his back

Satisfied that he’s got their attention he ties a GAG around
Jeffs mouth and knocks him to the ground Quickly BINDS his
hands

MILLER
(yelling into the woods)
You hear that

Miller starts to shove Jeff through the woods

EXT HIGH TRAIL - DAY

Curt and Lynn stand there stunned listening to Miller’s
demands --

MILLER (0S)
(faint)
One hour

Curt snaps out of it He takes a few steps up the PATH only
to stop when he realizes Lynn isn’t moving

CURT
Cmon

LYNN
What are we doing

CURT
What the hell do you think we’re
doing

But Lynn just SITS there pensive

LYNN
You said it yourself If he gets
the money he’s just going to kill
us anyway

CURT
We don’t know that

LYNN
He walked out on us Jeff took some
of your money and he walked out on
us

CURT
I don’t care We’re not going to
let him die

Lynn wrestles with what to do

LYNN
If it was you out there right now
what do you think he would say Do
you think he’d risk his life and
his money for you

Curt doesn’t answer The truth is he’s not sure He looks
out into the woods then back at Lynn

CURT
All I need to know is that I’m
gonna it for him

Curt heads for the RANGER CABIN Lynn hesitates for a moment
then follows

EXT FARTHER ALONG IN THE WOODS - LATER

Curt and Lynn are walking side by side now She pulls
something out of her pocket It’s Jeffs JACKKNIFE

CURT
Where’d you get that

LYNN
He was starting to freak me out so
I grabbed it out of his bag

CURT
Let’s hope you don’t need it

EXT RANGER CABIN AREA - DAY

The lonely RANGER CABIN stands on pylons twenty feet in the
air A ladder leading up provides the only way in or out

This small green house on its lofty perch provides an early
warning station for forest fires a platform for viewing
nature’s majesty and a beacon of hope to those that have lost
their way in the wilderness But not today

INT RANGER CABIN - DAY

Jeff slowly regains consciousness Tries to move But his
hands and feet are BOUND behind him The gag over his mouth
MUFFLES his screams

He rolls on the floor wrestling with the ropes but to no
avail Looks around the cabin The ranger’s RADIO has been
SMASHED No help there

A FIRST AID BOX is screwed to the wall He rolls over closer
to it then kicks at it The box stays screwed to the wall
but the lid swings open A few MEDICAL SUPPLIES fall out but
there’s something else still in the box

AN EMERGENCY SIGNAL FLARE

He kicks at it trying to knock it loose

EXT RANGER CABIN AREA - SAME TIME

A tall BUSHY PINE stands near the cabin’s pylons It would
take some very close scrutiny for anyone to notice Miller
standing within its branches

He’s motionless Calm His eyes are scanning the woods all
around from his perch ten feet in the air His eyes stop
searching Staring straight at --

CURT AND LYNN
Approaching cautiously on the TRAIL that leads to the cabin

CURT
(yelling)
We brought the money

Miller doesn’t respond He waits as they keep cautiously
walking toward the cabin

He has a HATCHET in his hand Curt and Lynn are going to be
right under him soon

INT RANGER CABIN - SAME TIME

Jeff lies on the floor exhausted from trying to kick the
SIGNAL FLARE He closes his eyes prepping for one more
effort

He contorts his body swings his legs up to the wall and
finally kicks the flare free He scrambles to it and GRABS it
with his bound hands

He grips the flare in his hands and puts the hanging string
under his chin Aiming it at the open window he manages to
PULL the string --

The flare GOES OFF It shoots toward the window - but hits
the sill Jeff ducks as the bright burning signal RICOCHETS
around the cabin

It comes to rest on a pile of BLANKETS in the corner They
begin to SMOLDER

Jeff rolls over to try and put the flare out but by the time
he gets close the blankets have ignited into a small
FIREBALL He rolls back away The flames are SPREADING to the
wall

Scraping his face along the floor he finally manages to
dislodge the gag - and YELLS

EXT RANGER CABIN AREA - CONTINUOUS

Curt and Lynn are startled by Jeffs voice YELLING from the
cabin SMOKE is rolling out of the window

They RUN in his direction And they’re about to pass under
the tree where MILLER stands waiting

INT RANGER CABIN - CONTINUOUS

SMOKE is filling the cabin and the FLAMES are spreading Jeff
rolls to the opposite side of the room to try and get away
He bumps the door of a UTILITY CLOSET and sees that it’s
ajar

He kicks it OPEN and the body of a DEAD RANGER falls on top
of him

Wide eyed he rolls out from under it Breathes in more smoke
and starts COUGHING Looks over the body There is a HATCHET
SHEATH on his belt but it’s EMPTY

Desperate he looks at his own bound hands and feet and then
at the FLAMES across the room

EXT RANGER CABIN AREA - SAME TIME

Miller DROPS down from the tree - and knocks Lynn to the
ground Raises his HATCHET Lynn manages to swing her arm up
to protect herself

Miller’s hatchet comes down on Lynn’s ARM cutting deep and
BREAKING the bone

He raises his HATCHET again Curt swings one of the heavy
backpacks and KNOCKS Miller off of Lynn just before the
hatchet strikes

INT RANGER CABIN

Jeff has his bound feet over the flames BURNING himself
free He SCREAMS as the heat blisters his skin When he can’t
take it a second longer he pulls his legs away from the
fire

Tries to break loose Not quite It’s going to take another
try

Smoke brings tears to his eyes He happens to squint over at
the RANGER’S BODY Sees something --

The ranger’s pant leg is lifted up a bit revealing a
previously unseen ANKLE HOLSTER And in it - A GUN

EXT RANGER CABIN AREA

Miller scrambles to his feet after being knocked down by
Curt Lynn is MOANING on the ground holding her bloody
SHATTERED ARM

Curt squares off with Miller enraged He has his SWISS ARMY
KNIFE OUT Miller smiles flipping the HATCHET around

Curt runs straight at him Miller winds back and THROWS the
hatchet --

At the same time Curt swings his backpack around in front of
him The hatchet plants deep into the wads of money

Miller SCREAMS in agony - Lynn has just sunk Jeffs JACKKNIFE
into the back of his one good leg

Curt plows him over Miller and Curt roll onto the ground
Curt loses his Swiss Army knife somewhere in the mud as they
wrestle Both of them claw for the HATCHET

Curt rolls on top causing the jackknife in the back of
Miller’s leg to BURY itself deeper He HOWLS with pain and
rage

Curt gets hold of the hatchet But Miller rips it away
Swings it --

Hits Curt with the dull side BREAKING HIS NOSE and knocking
him a few feet back

Miller winds up with the hatchet ready to throw it at Curt
lying on the ground --

But he’s hit in the head by a ROCK thrown by Lynn It only
seems to make him more angry He turns on her

BEHIND MILLER

Curt is getting up He’s feeling around for something in his
pockets Has it --

Curt pulls out a tangle of FISHING LINE
Lynn is rolling on the ground the pain from her arm becoming

unbearable Just as Miller is about to reach her Curt whips
the fishing line around his neck STRANGLING him

Miller swings his elbows back into Curt but he just absorbs
the pain and pulls the line TIGHTER

The lines cut deep into Miller’s throat He drops to his
knees Behind him Curt pulls as hard as he can and the
fishing lines SLICE into his HANDS

Miller reaches back and manages to pull the JACKKNIFE out of
his leg Tries to stab it into Curt behind him - hits nothing
but air

With a last desperate effort Miller snakes the knife up to
fishing lines around his neck --

SNAP He cuts the lines and breaks FREE just before he would
have strangled to death

Curt falls back and Miller rolls onto the ground struggling
for breath and holding his bloody throat

Curt tries to get upright but he’s completely spent - blood
runs from his HANDS and his NOSE as he fights to stay
conscious

Miller staggers over to Curt on his two bad legs and raises
the KNIFE about to plunge it into Curt’s heart

That’s when he sees JEFF - Aiming the GUN

Miller THROWS THE KNIFE at him at the very instant that the
GUN GOES OFF

Miller falls over SHOT in the stomach But the knife has
found its target It’s BURIED IN JEFF’S NECK and he collapses
to the ground

CURT
Jeff

No answer from his friend Jeff is DEAD

Miller is CRAWLING now with whatever strength he has left
Crawling menacingly toward Curt

Lynn throws herself onto Miller’s back flattening him into
the wet earth With her one good arm she grabs him by the
hair and holds his head down

He swats at her trying to shake her off but she slams her
knee into his back and throws the weight of her upper body
against the back of his head

Lynn screams like an animal as she DROWNS Miller in two
inches of MUD

It’s the last thing Curt sees before he finally PASSES OUT

FADE TO

EXT RANGER CABIN AREA - DUSK

Curt comes to and finds himself seated against the TRUNK of
a tree The remains of the cabin are smoldering in the
background

Lynn has propped up ALL THE BACKPACKS of money in front of
him sitting next to them The RANGER’S GUN is sitting on
top

The SPLINT that Miller had on his leg is now wrapped around
her BANDAGED ARM

LYNN
Hey

CURT
Hey

Curt looks around The burned CORPSE of the ranger can be
seen over by the cabin MILLER’S BODY lies not far away as
does JEFF Curt stares at his friend’s lifeless body
transfixed

Lynn moves closer to Curt He turns away from Jeff and locks
eyes with her

LYNN
There’s a small boat by the cabin
with an outboard motor We’1l take
it to Canada

CURT
We can’t do that

LYNN
(not listening)
I figure once we get to Canada we
can just lay low for a little
while Then when we’re ready we
could drive to Mexico

Curt puts his hand up to push her away but stops when he
sees that both his HANDS are wrapped with cloth Stained
through with blood

LYNN
Your hands were pretty bad But I
took care of them It’s over now
She looks over at the BURNED CABIN

LYNN
Think someone will see the smoke

CURT
It’ll be dark soon

Curt stares at Jeff again

CURT
We shouldn’t leave him out like
that We should bury him

LYNN
Look at us That’s not going to
happen

Curt looks at his HANDS and at her BROKEN ARM

CURT
Let’s at least cover him with a
sheet or something

Lynn nods but doesn’t move

LYNN
I need to rest a little more

Curt nods

LYNN
Maybe the Caribbean Think about
it We could get a boat and just
sail off together

CURT
Lynn we’re not going anywhere
Jeffs dead This has gone too far
It’s over

Lynn is taken aback
LYNN
Weve gone too far to not keep the
money now
Curt shakes his head
CURT

No It was one thing when we were
all going to get away clean

LYNN
You and I can still get away

CURT
That’s not the life I want

Lynn is quiet for a moment as this sinks in

She looks at the MONEY At JEFF At the BOAT that could carry
them to Canada

Curt musters what strength he has left and gets to his feet
Takes off his JACKET Staggers over to Jeff

Jeffs EYES are open Curt reaches down to close them but
they won’t close He puts the jacket down covering up the
body He’s crying

He goes back and sits down Looks over at the body one more
time Somehow seeing his feet sticking out from under a
jacket makes it look even worse

Lynn is lying next to her backpack She may be asleep
already Curt looks at where the ranger’s gun had been
sitting on top of the bags It’s NOT THERE anymore

CURT
Lynn

LYNN
(sleepy)
When the sun comes up we should
take the boat and turn the money in
at the next ranger station It’1l
be faster than walking

Curt looks at her suspiciously He makes his way over to
where she is and lies down nearby

But he snakes his arm through one of the BACKPACK STRAPS as
he lies down Covers himself with a blanket If anyone tries
to move his bag he’1ll know He peers out at Lynn with half
closed lids as he pretends to sleep

EXT RANGER CABIN AREA - LATE NIGHT

Lynn startles awake and opens her eyes Quickly turns over to
check on --

CURT He’s still lying there with his eyes closed Slowly
carefully Lynn starts to get up She’s holding the GUN
Tears are welling up in her eyes

FADE TO

EXT RANGER CABIN AREA - MORNING

Curt wakes up from a deep sleep to feel the sensation of a
GUN being PRESSED AGAINST HIS TEMPLE

MARSHAL
Easy now son Let go of the gun

Curt is looking up at a US MARSHAL The Marshal has a gun
to Curt’s head

A couple of PARK RANGERS stand nearby with shotguns One of
them is the RANGER that they passed on the river two days
ago

Curt looks over into his own hand and sees the REVOLVER that
Lynn planted there He winces Lets the gun DROP His other

hand is still intertwined with the strap from his backpack

only the pack is not there It’s been CUT LOOSE

The Marshal slaps CUFFS on him as the rangers keep him
covered Curt looks around for Lynn She’s gone So are all
the BACKPACKS

MARSHAL
Where’s the money

CURT
This isn’t what it looks like

MARSHAL
Looks to me like double homicide
Probably triple once we find where
you hid the girl Where is she

Curt looks down to where the CANOE used to be
CURT
Youll get her Something’s bound
to turn up
EXT SAGANAGA LAKE - NEAR ONTARIO - MORNING
In the middle of the LARGE LAKE is a small green BOAT LYNN

motors across the huge expanse of water approaching the fAR
SHORE A beautiful morning and not another craft in sight

She looks up at the LOONS flying overhead and almost smiles

EXT CANADIAN SHORE - SOON AFTER

A canoe rental area with a small SHACK and rows upon rows of
CANOES stacked up on the shore A sign reads ‘JACK’S CANOE
RENTALS’

Lynn beaches the boat Hops out and starts STRUGGLING to pull
it ashore with her one good arm

IN THE ADJACENT PARKING LOT

The door opens from one of the only cars and a man steps out
It’s a Canadian MOUNTIE

He walks over to where Lynn is struggling with the boat
She’s startled to see him

MOUNTIE
Let me help you with that miss

His gives her a reassuring smile and helps her DRAG the boat
onto shore Takes a closer look at it

MOUNTIE
This belongs to a ranger

LYNN
I couldn’t find him and I needed
medical attention
(shows her arm)
It’s broken

The Mountie looks at her injuries and nods A MAN has emerged
from the canoe rental hut wondering what’s going on The
Mountie calls over to him --

MOUNTIE
Hey Jack Can you take care of this
boat for me I’m going to drive her
to the hospital

JACK nods and grabs the boat The Mountie reaches to pick up
one of the three BACKPACKS from the boat

LYNN
Ill get it

She slings one backpack on and grabs for the other two

MOUNTIE
Don’t be ridiculous I’ve got it

He hoists up two backpacks Feels the WEIGHT Starts walking
he back to the car

MOUNTIE
(laughing)
Not exactly travelling light are
you
LYNN

I don’t think I need a hospital I
have some family nearby One of
them’s a doctor

JACK (0S)
Hey

MOUNTIE
(not hearing the yell)
You sure

Lynn nods

JACK (0S)
You need to take a look over here

The Mountie turns around Sees --

Jack has pulled the boat farther ashore revealing a ROPE
tied to the stern At the end of that floats a BODY wrapped
in Lynn’s sleeping bag

It’s the CORPSE OF THE PARK RANGER from the cabin

The Mountie’s face turns cold and he draws a GUN on Lynn She
closes her eyes as the ramifications sink in

FADE TO

EXT PORTAGE NEAR RAPIDS - DAY

Curt has returned to the place where Jeff lost his bag of
money

Some time has passed His HANDS have healed

Curt eyes a spot in the RAPIDS He pulls out a rope and
tethers himself to a tree onshore WADES out into the water

EXT PORTAGE NEAR RAPIDS - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Curt Lynn and Jeff are getting ready to lift the canoe with
the bags of money inside Jeff shares a playful look with
Lynn

Curt catches it

Images flash through his mind --

Jeff and Lynn getting into their tent together at night
Jeff holding her next to the fire

Jeff shaking Curt’s hand just before he left for college

As the three of them lift the canoe Curt bumps it Jeffs way
on purpose causing him to drop it

Causing the bag of money to roll out into the rapids

UNDER THE WATER - MOMENTS LATER

Curt finds the BAG under the rapids but doesn’t bring it to
the surface He TIES THE STRAP around the branch of a

submerged tree and piles rocks on top of it

END FLASHBACK
EXT PORTAGE NEAR RAPIDS - DAY

Curt emerges from the rapids with JEFF’S BAG of half a
million dollars and begins to pull himself toward shore

FADE OUT
