MARTY
Its all right I think They still
there
The two cavaliers turn their heads and look off-screen
the direction of the three girls Apparently the girls

still there Marty and Angie relinquish their lounging
positions against the wall and slouch along past the

stags with a show of determined unconcern They edge
the crush of people on the non-dancing margin of the
floor and slowly push their way toward the

THREE GIRLS

Marty and Angie come in and start to approach the three
The girls stiffen and

aware of the boys presence

chatter comes to a halt Angie advances to one of the

MARTY
Sure

He turns and heads sluggishly in the direction of the
line

THE STAG LINE

A TRAVEL SHOT follows Marty as he moves past the line
stags all of whom are watching him CAMERA HOLDS as he
his old niche by the wall leans there A moment later
glances guardedly down to where the short girl and her
are

MARTYS POV The Short Girl is approached by a

young BOY who asks her to dance She smiles excuses

to her friend and follows the boy out onto the dance

Marty stares at the Short Girl He shrugs hes used to

kind of thing then turns his attention bleakly back to
watching

THE DANCE FLOOR

The band starts up again and the MUSIC blares Its a
Hop number Couples swirl past the MUSIC comes up BIG

Marty leans against the wall smoking and watching the
swirl past Dr Keegans VOICE is heard

five dollar bill The Stag detaches himself from the
and a little ill-at-ease follows the Doctor
Marty stands against the wall watching the Doctor and

Stag who come in and move past him Concerned and

Marty stares after them then moves out of his leaning
position following in their general direction

Marty moves through the crush of young men and women in
area around the dance floor

ALCOVE NEAR ARCHWAY

As Marty reaches the alcove that separates the dance
proper from the lounge he pauses and looks off toward
booths

LOUNGE

Clara sits about halfway down the length of the booths
Keegan and the Stag stand over her talking to her She
looking up at them her hands nervously gripping a Coca
glass Dr Keegan is obviously introducing the Stag to

the Stag leave the booth and start back toward the

ARCHWAY
From where Marty stands he can watch Clara as well as
Keegan and the Stag The Doctor and the Stag start past
and he catches their conversation
DR KEEGAN
in that case as long as shes

STAG
Look Mac you paid me the five bucks

They move past and away and Marty stares after them
he turns his attention toward Clara off-screen
Clara is sitting as she was gripping and ungripping

an
anxious smile on his face
THOMAS

They sit opposite each other in the booth Each has a
coffee Marty is still talking but now he is
telling a story so funny that he can hardly get the
out The hilarity has communicated itself to Clara Her
are burning with suppressed laughter Every now and
has to gasp to control the bubbly giggling inside of
MARTY
so Im inna kneeling position
and if you ever try shooting a BAR
inna kneeling position you know
what I mean I cant holda steady
position Im wavering back and
forth
He has to interrupt the narrative to control a seizure

MARTY

giggle

himself again)
SO just then I hear five shots go
off from the guy next to me

Its too much for him He lets out a sudden guffaw and
instantly smothers it under shaking shoulders Clara

her face in her hands and giggles desperately Some of
other people turn to look at them

MARTY
So my target goes down and a minute
later the flag comes up I got five
bulls-eyes This cross-eyed guy next
to me he shot five bulls-eyes into
my target

He stares at the girl spent from laughter

So then Mr Gazzara -- he was a
frienda my father -- he offered me

this job in his butcher shop and
everybody pleaded with me to take

it So thats what happened I didnt
wanna be a butcher

CLARA
Theres nothing wrong with being a
butcher

MARTY

Well I wouldnt call it an elegant
profession Its in a lower social
scale People look down on butchers

CLARA
I dont

Marty looks quickly up at her then back down

MARTY
Well the point is Mr Gazzara wantsa
sell his shop now because he and
his wife are lonely and they wanna
move out to California in Los Angeles
and live near their married daughter
Because shes always writing them to
come out there So its a nice little
shop I handle his books for him so
I know he has a thirty-five percent
markup which is not unreasonable
and he takes home net maybe a hundred
hundred and fifty bucks a week The
point is of course you gotta worry
about the supermarkets Theres two
inna neighborhood now and theres

an AandP coming in at least thats

the rumor Of course mosta his trade
is strictly Italian but the younger
Italian girls they get married and
they dont stick to the old Italian
dishes so much I mean you gotta
take that into account too

CLARA
Its my feeling that you really want
to buy this shop Marty

MARTY
Thats true I do But Im gonna
have to take outta loan inna bank
eight thousand dollars Thats a big
note to carry because I have to
give Mr Gazzara a mortgage and
what I have to weigh is will it pay
off in the end more than I can make
onna salary

Clara looks down at her fingers her face alive and
sensitive

She carefully assembles her words in her mind Then she
looks

at the squat butcher across the table from her

CLARA
Marty I know you for three hours
but I know youre a good butcher
Youre an intelligent sensitive
decent man I have a feeling about
you like sometimes a kid comes in to
see me for one reason or another
And some of these kids Marty in my
classes they have so much warmth in
them so much capacity And thats
the feeling I get about you

Marty shuts his eyes then opens them quickly bows his
head

CLARA
If you were one of my students I
would say Go ahead and buy the
butcher shop Youre a good butcher

Clara pauses

MARTY
(not quite trusting

the timbre of his

voice)
Well theres a lotta things I could
do with this shop I could organize
my own supermarket Get a buncha
neighborhood merchants together
Thats what a lotta them are doing

He looks up at her now

MARTY
Wadda you think

CLARA
I think anything you want to do
youll do well

Tears begin to flood his eyes again He quickly looks
away
He licks his lips

MARTY
(still looking down)
Im Catholic Are you Catholic

Clara looks down at her hands

CLARA
(also in a low voice)
Yes I am

Marty looks up at her

MARTY
I only got about three bucks on me
now but I just live about eight
blocks from here on the other side
of Webster Avenue Why dont we walk
back to my house Ill run in pick
up some dough and lets step out

CLARA

luncheonette

reaches the Grand Concourse Here he pauses a moment a
at a loss for what direction to take -- then remembers
needs the uptown bus

He moves across the wide street to get to the other

the boulevard Again he seems to lose track of which
direction is homeward

He walks uptown a ways with a strange jerky stride

every once in a while to see whether theres a bus

Suddenly Marty breaks into a dog-trot then drops back
the stiff stride as he approaches

CHURCH
A HIGH WIDE ANGLE SHOT of the church establishes that
of Sunday morning between the nine and ten oclock
People flock around the doors of the church
INSIDE THE CHURCH
The parishioners are making their ways to the door A
silent penitents still kneel here and there in the long
rows of pews The large almost empty church is filled
with organ MUSIC
Both Marty and his mother seem a little depressed as
stand at the doorway just inside the church as the
oclock mass people flow out and the first of the ten
mass people file in
MRS PILLETTI
That was a nice girl last night
Marty
(Marty nods)
She wasnt a very good-looking girl

It is

not an expression he would normally associate with an
evening

with Clara

MARTY

ANGIE
Oh I couldnt eat nothing My mother
just stuffed me right up to the jaws
This doesnt prevent him from filching a second piece
of
rissole

JOE
What I like about Mickey Spillane is
he knows how to handle women In one
book he picks up a tomato who gets
hit with a car and she throws a
pass at him And then he meets two
beautiful twins and they throw passes
at him And then he meets some
beautiful society leader and she
throws a pass at him and
