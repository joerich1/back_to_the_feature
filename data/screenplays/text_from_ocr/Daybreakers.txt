INT TEENAGE GIRL’S BEDROOM — DAWN 2

A heavy shutter blocks the morning light from entering the
bedroom

A young girl LISA sits at her dresser writing a letter
her face masked by long black hair Lisa’s clothes look out
of place too sophisticated for an 8 year old

Photographs of family and friends overlap each other
completely covering the dresser mirror

Lisa finishes her letterplaces it in an envelope and sits
it on her neatly made bed The envelope reads Mom and Dad

garden However there are modifications the few windows

underground sidewalks

Lisa sits cross-legged on the front lawn

The morning sun rises behind the trees inching its way
towards Lisa

BOOM - She bursts into flames Piercing screams echo through
the suburban street as Lisa’s body burns in the morning sun
The flames pulsate like the rhythm of a heart beat

A fire alarm is activated Three heavy duty sprinkler heads
come out of the grass around Lisa’s burning body the water
spray perfectly synchronized

The fire is out The sprinklers retract The alarm bells
stop

EXT WILSON AND SONS ELECTRONICS - NIGHT 12
Rain falls in front of the shop This is a second rate
electronics store in a run-down urban street a stark
contrast to the glossy commercial

We travel to another TV displaying a news story

EXT FOREST FIRES - NIGHT 13

ON TV - Forest fires ravage bush lands as a JOURNALIST talks
over the images

JOURNALIST (V0)
»«ten years after the 2009
outbreak vampiric wildlife
wandering into sunlight has grown
to become the number one cause of
forest fires throughout the nation
The total wildlife feeding ban has
not deterred

We then travel to another TV displaying a political debate

INT DEBATE NEWSROOM - CONTINUOUS 14

A split screen image of two well-dressed politicians in a
heated discussion plays out on a national news station

SENATOR WES TURNER (60’s) a distinguished African American
gentleman debates with SENATOR ROGER WESTLAKE (50’s)

A NEWS ANCHOR mediates
They are all vampires

SENATOR WESTLAKE
You cannot overturn a Supreme Court
ruling Humans were offered a
chance to assimilate but refused
Therefore they are enemies of the
state and will be captured and
farmed for blood supply

SENATOR TURNER
It’s a disgrace that we have
reduced human beings to mere
vessels for blood supply We
should be focussing on finding a
blood substitute

SENATOR WESTLAKE
(overpowering)

»we always come back to the
elusive magic potion solution
Where is it We need to be
realistic The continuation of
HUMAN blood farming is the only
answer

SENATOR TURNER
And then what Exterminating a
species for our short term gain is
ludicrous

EXT WILSON AND SONS ELECTRONICS - CONTINUOUS 15

We pull back from the TV to reveal a HOMELESS MAN watching the debate from the sidewalk He is a vampire His
features are more bat-like than other vampires we’ve
encountered so far His hands are mutated like half formed
wings his nose is squashed and ears point at the tips

A sign hangs around his neck ‘STARVING NEED BLOOD’
The Homeless Man sings with a crackly drunken slur

HOMELESS MAN
Oh death oh death how can it be
That I must come and go with thee
Oh death oh death how can it be
I’m unprepared for eternity

A MIDDLE AGED COUPLE dressed in business attire stroll past
the seemingly harmless Homeless Man

Then suddenly the Homeless Man lashes out at them with his
mutated wing

BIG JUMPS

The couple recoil narrowly avoiding his attack

The Homeless Man shrieks The sound is similar to that of a
common bat but the tone is lower and far more ferocious

Suddenly a metal clamp snaps around the Homeless Man’s neck
The clamp is attached to a large pole held firmly by a well
groomed VAMPIRE POLICE OFFICER (30’s) His PARTNER (30‘s)
stands behind him night stick at the ready

The Middle Aged Couple retreat to the other end of the
street The Homeless Man raises his wingready to strike

The Vampire Police Officer presses a switch at the end of the
pole An electric charge surges through the Homeless Man
making him drop to the ground

A CADILLAC with sun-blocking shades lowered for night
driving cruises past

EXT SUBWAY STATION PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 16

The rain stops The Cadillac parks in one of the last
remaining spots outside the busy train station

ANGLE ON - THE DRIVER’S reflection in the side door
mirrorjust a suit with no head or hands

ANGLE FROM - the vehicle’‘s mirror over to EDWARD DALTON sitting behind the wheel Ed is also a vampire

He rubs his tired yellow eyes and scratches his scruffy black
hair Ed’s suit although expensive looks slept in

Ed steps out of his car and glances across the street ata
bus shelter

Waiting at the shelter are TWENTY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS all
physically between the ages of six to nine They goof around
like all teenagers dolaughing talking and smoking

The yellow bus arrives with the branding “North Park High
School” written on its side

INT SUBWAY STATION PLATFORM - LATER 17
A dingy Subway Station

FIFTY VAMPIRE BUSINESS MEN AND WOMEN wait patiently for their
train to arrive Ed stands among the masses

The men and women occupy themselves with night to night
things like reading the paper talking on their cell phones
and getting in a quick cup of blood before work

A long line has formed at the platform’s Starbucks An
assortment of coffees is available all mixed with varying
amounts of human blood

A muted TV displays a news report A VAMPIRE ANCHORWOMAN speaks with confidence as a graphic to the side of her
reads Blood Shortage Cripples Third World

A massive billboard almost covers the entire train station
wall The artwork is the classic ‘I want you for the US
Army’ poster except Uncle Sam’s face is that of a vampire
Underneath the image a slogan reads ‘Capture Make a
Difference’ A corporate logo sits at the bottom of the
billboard BromleyMarks Pharmaceuticals

The lights flicker as a train charges past The brief
moments of darkness are highlighted by the reflective glint
of the vampire commuter’s eyes

We move away from the billboard and travel underneath the
subway platform

The strobing light of the passing train illuminates the
tunnel giving us glimpses of TWO DEFORMED VAMPIRES hanging
upside down between the concrete pylons

These are SUBSIDER’S (50s) foul looking blood deprived
vampires with thin bony bat-like features The glint in
their eyes is similar to that of the commuters

They are in the middle of a fight The brawl is violent and
fast they claw and bite each other like rabid dogs

The metallic grind of the stopping train echoes into

EXT BROMLEYMARKS PHARMACEUTICALS - LATER 18
»ethe roar of bustling city traffic

Beyond the vehicle headlights is the massive structure that
is the BromleyMarks Pharmaceuticals building Ed walks
towards the entrance

INT BROMLEYMARKS SECURITY LOG-IN - CONTINUOUS 19

The small room is simple and clean This is the check point
between the building’s entrance and the main security desk

The device displays Ed’s clearance details BromleyMarks

back wall behind the security deskhe eyeballs Ed

Ed turns left down the corridor out of view of the onlookers

He waits for an elevator BINGit arrives

INT BROMLEYMARKS PHARMACEUTICALS CELLS - CONTINUOUS 21

The elevator opens to reveal TWO HUNDRED HUMANS hanging in a
giant blood farm Their drugged bodies hang like meat in a
cold room Steel collars are secured to their necks to
facilitate regular blood extraction They are alive but
only just

The farm can house over ONE THOUSAND HUMANS there are many
empty slots

Ed walks past the cells with his head facing the ground he
can’t bring himself to look at the humans

Ed enters the lab the door closes swiftly behind him

INT ELECTRON MICROSCOPE - NIGHT 22

Pressed onto a glass plate are dozens of magnified blood
cells

INT BROMLEYMARKS HEMATOLOGY LAB - CONTINUOUS 23

Ed now dressed in a white lab coat lifts his head from the
eye piece of his electron microscope

The spacious lab is a hive of activity VAMPIRE SCIENTISTS
conduct their research using the latest technology developed
for blood testing

A YOUNG VAMPIRE IN A WHITE LAB COAT approaches Ed and
taps him on the shoulderhe has been summoned

INT BROMLEY’S OFFICE - LATER 24
The opulent dimly lit office overlooks a bustling city

Ed sits at one of two chairs in front of a large oak table
He holds a wine glass full of blood

CHARLES BROMLEY a distinguished well dressed well
groomed CEO stands with his back to Ed staring out his
window

BROMLEY
Edward I understand your concerns
(pause)
(MORE )
BROMLEY (contd)
Did I ever tell you about my
daughter Alison

Ed shakes his head

ED
No Mr Bromley

BROMLEY
In early 2008 I was diagnosed with
Sarcoma The shock of finding out
I had cancer was one thing but
having to tell my daughtershe
was devastated I prayed for a
miracle butwas realistic Then
the world changed My prayers were
answered when the plague hit
Immortality gave me my cure

Ed stares at the dark red liquid in his full wine glass He
hasn’t had a drop

BROMLEY (CONT’‘D)

My daughter and I now had all the
time in the world But she saw the
evolution as a disease more
destructive than any cancer She
refused to turn I was a monster
to her She ran like s0 many did
I haven’t seen her for nearly ten
years I can only assume the worst

Bromley turns around and faces Ed

BROMLEY (CONT’D)
We are blessed Edward you have to
stare death in the face to truly
understand that

ED
We‘re not ready Mr Bromley It’s
too soon

Bromley gestures towards Ed’s full wine glass
BROMLEY
I’ve noticed that you haven’t been
drinking your daily blood rations
You pity the humans don’t you

Ed avoids answering

BROMLEY (CONT’D)
These are desperate times We must
commence testing the blood
substitute It’s the only way we
can help the human race I’m
counting on you Edward

Every part of Ed’s demeanor says ‘This is a terrible idea’

however he sits in silence

CHRISTOPHER

ex-wife wasn’t around

Christopher grins Ed doesn’t laugh

We are in the middle of an operation
Ed heads up the team along with Christopher

TWO NURSES assist the doctors in the procedure They’re all
dressed in grey operating garmentsno need for masks

The room is equipped with the latest medical technologies
designed for the vampire race

An eclectic group of vampires stands on an observation deck
twelve feet above the operating floor

soldier NICHOLAS WALKER (60’s) the company’s financial
advisor ADMINISTRATORS (40’s) COMMISSIONERS (50’s-60’s)
SCIENTISTS (30’s-50’s) and of course Charles Bromley

A VAMPIRE SUBJECT lays comfortably on an operating table His
dog tags haircut and formal responses to questions reveal
his military background

ED
How do you feel

VAMPIRE SUBJECT
No change sir

Ed injects the remaining serum into his patient’s arm The
Vampire Subject flinches slightly but remains calm

ED
Now private you may sense a slight
rise in temperature as the Polyheme
enters your body that’s expected

VAMPIRE SUBJECT
Yes sir

Christopher observes the Vampire Subject’s body temperature
on a monitor it elevates from sixty to sixty two

Ed appears mildly concerned as he glances up at the prying
eyes of the Administrators above him

The Vampire Subject’s temperature suddenly rises another four
degrees

CHRISTOPHER
Six degree increase

Ed remains calm as he comforts the patient

ED
Slightly more accelerated than
anticipated but ok

Bromley claws at the balcony railing as he leans over for a
better view

Christopher glances back over at the monitor and notices
another two degree increase He turns to Ed they both stare
at each other unsure of the stability of their experiment

The Vampire Subject’s body temperature levels out

CHRISTOPHER
Sixty eight degrees and holding

The Administrators collectively lean over the balcony for a
closer look

Nurse 2 leans over the Vampire Subject lightly dabbing his
forehead with a damp cloth

ED
How do you feel son

VAMPIRE SUBJECT
I feel fine si

Suddenly the Vampire Subject coughs up white bile all over
Nurse 2

She screams in shock

His body breaks out into smouldering boils expanding like a
balloon

Ed holds the Vampire Subject down as he flails around in
agony The Nurses attempt to hold his spasming feet down on
the table Ed turns to Christopher for assistance

ED
Chris we need 50ccs of Epimone

Christopher races over to a steel tray he grabs a syringe
and a vial Shaking he begins to fill the syringe with a
light yellow liquid

The Vampire Subject’s body returns to normal all the boils
disappear He turns and glances over at Ed calmly

VAMPIRE SUBJECT
Owe

cluttered at one end of a long oval shaped conference desk
while Ed and Christopher sit at the other The two have
showered and redressed Ed looks rundownbroken

WALKER
All material presented in this
meeting is classified
Commissioner

The COMMISSIONER OF THE FDA stands up behind Bromley
and clicks a button on his remote control

The lights dim

A black and white image of a PRISON INMATE VAMPIRE weathered but healthy projects onto the back wall His
melancholy blood shot eyes stare blankly ahead Text beneath
the image reads “ WEEKS OF BLOOD DEPRIVATION - INMATE
4075B”

COMMISSIONER

Death-Row Inmate 4075B was selected
for an eight week study on the
effects of blood deprivation

ED

What

Ed is disgusted by the inhumanity of the study

The Commissioner flicks through four images over two week
intervals By the final image “8 WEEKS OF BLOOD DEPRIVATION
— INMATE 4075B” the once healthy vampire is gone To Ed’s
horror what remains is a skeletal bat-like creature shaking
(this renders the image slightly out of focus)

COMMISSIONER (CONT’D)
A complete lack of human blood over
this period of time resulted ina
massive deterioration of the
frontal lobe Mental functions
such as logic emotion most parts
of speech all terminated much
faster than you and your team had

originally speculated Doctor
Dalton

Ed and Christopher are shocked by the figure

COMMISSIONER (CONT’D)
Our latest statistics show that
only five percent of the human
population remain ‘This’ is
starting to become a real problem

General Williams disagrees with the Commissioner

GENERAL WILLIAMS
Five percent The FDA can’t be
certain of that We continue to

find human camps all over the
world

ED

We’re talking about the extinction
of the human race

COMMISSIONER
We’re talking about only having
enough blood to sustain our
population for another six months

General Williams is in complete denial

GENERAL WILLIAMS
Six monthsnonsense

WALKER
If a blood substitute is not found
immediately this

Walker points to the projected image of the blood deprived
inmate

Ed’s Cadillac cruises down the wet suburban street passing by
a sign that reads “BromleyMarks Estate” The neighborhood
echoes an upper class suburbthe double story houses the

FRANKIE
We’re all animals we feed off
blood Most of us have learned to
accept it

ED
A blood substitute means the end of
human hunting

FRANKIE
Fake blood I like fake tits but
sometimes I gotta have the real
thing It doesn’t mean the end of
shit

Ed starts to pour the blood out into the sink

Enraged Frankie grabs hold of the bottle violently knocking
Ed to the ground

Frankie looks at the now half empty bottle

With blistering rage Frankie hurls it against the laundry
entrance wall The bottle shatters blood sprays everywhere

Terrified Ed watches on in disbelief
Frankie wants to say something he can’t find any words the

best thing he can do is leave Frankie heads for the laundry
door

Suddenly out of the darkness of the laundry a SUBSIDER
tears into the room

SHIT Tt scares the heil out of them
Frankie stumbles backwards Ed jumps to his feet

The thin pale bat-like creature licks the blood soaked wall
like a thirsty wolf

Frankie is quick to react grabbing a mop from next to the
fridge and swinging it at the creatureWHACK

Splinters fly as the mop breaks over the Subsider’s head

The Subsider roars in pain The creature shatters a cabinet
as it expands its large deformed wings

The beast swoops at Frankie throwing him over the kitchen
tablethese creatures are strong

Ed grabs a chair blocking the Subsider’s advances

Ed continues to push the creature away with his chair The
Subsider leapsspinning upside down and sinking his clawed
feet firmly into the ceiling

Frankie staggers back to his feet he reaches for the knife
rack drawing a large butcher’s bladenow he has the correct
weapon

Frankie slices into the Subsiders stomachhis winghis
chestFrankie’s blows are fast and accurate

The creature falls from the ceilingdropping to its knees

swift motion slices the Subsiders head clean off

AUDREY
You read the papers

How are you feeling Edward The
attack this morning must have been
very traumatic

ED
I’m fine

BROMLEY
I understand your brother was quite
effective in deterring the
intruder Perhaps I can pull some
stringshave him assigned to our
Special Operations Unit here

ED
You don’t need to do that sir

Ed’s response is abrupt

BROMLEY
These attacks on everyday citizens
are a cause for great concern All
the more reason for us to find a
substitute as soon as possible
wouldn’t you say

ED
Finding a substitute sirthis
will mean freedom for all humans
around the world correct

BROMLEY
It’s important that we allow the
human race time to repopulate

ED
With all due respect that’s not
what I asked

Bromley deceptively smiles

BROMLEY
The majority of the population will
be content with a blood substitute
yesbut there will always be
those who are willing to pay top
dollar for the ‘real thing’

Ed can’t believe it ‘How could he not have seen this
coming’

BROMLEY (CONT’D)

parks directly opposite the ‘67 Mustang - Where is the

driver

Ed cautiously climbs out of the Cadillac He squints the
sunlight blinds him

Ed lights a cigarette

From behind the tree trunk a STRANGER’S VOICE casually
speaks

STRANGER (0S)
Trees are the oldest living things
on earth did you know that Yeah
I read that somewhere They say
some of em’ are over four thousand
years old

The Stranger emerges from behind the trunk He looks
up at the enormous branches

The glare of the burning hot sun makes it difficult for Ed to
get a look at his face however he does notice the rifle
draped over the man’s shoulder

STRANGER (CONT’D)
Someday though she’ll dieand so
will you Maybe you wont die of
old age like her But the thing
you’re still holding on to that
last breath of humanity it’1ll
vanish as soon as the blood does

Who are you

STRANGER
You’re running out of time Dalton

Ed continues to smoke

ED
I don’t know what you’re talking
about What do you want

The same thing you do a future

The Stranger moves towards Ed

STRANGER (CONT’D)
I was like you once

The Stranger folds down the collar of his jacket revealing
two bite marks on his neck

STRANGER (CONT’D)
But not no more

The Stranger steps into a small pocket of light that
penetrates the tree’s dense branches For the first time we
can clearly see his scarred face Second and third degree
burns cover most of his exposed body

He takes a deep breath embracing the sunlight

Audrey checks the tree line all clearshe checks behind
her towards Ed everything looks fineshe spins back to

the tree line - from out of nowhere a MAN IN A SUN PROTECTIVE
SUIT stands in front of her

The suit masks the man’s face

He quickly smashes his hand against her mouth muffling her
screams

Ed takes another drag of his cigarette

ED
Who are you

ELVIS offers his hand for Ed to shake

Ed stares at Elvis as he sings - who the hell is this guy
ELVIS (CONT’D)
Girl girl girl

Elvis shifts out of the sunlight grabs hold of Ed’s hand

and places it on his heart
Ed’s stunned

HUMMER heading towards them at breakneck speed Ed turns to
look

ED

FRANKIE

ED

No

Audrey sees an opportunitywith all her strength she
shoves Frankie towards a patch of sunlight

He writhes in agony as trickles of light singe his face

Frankie spins back around only to receive a fist to the face
from Elvis

Frankie topples to the ground dropping his weapon

Audrey swiftly kicks Frankie’s gun and sun protective helmet
into the sunlight

Elvis then steps in front of Ed aiming his weapon at the
Hummer

Laying on the surgical bed is an EMACIATED MALE HUMAN His lifeless body completely drained of blood Tubes connect
to his arms and feet His eyes open locked in place

The gurney rattles down the hallway as Bromley approaches the
entrance door to the blood farm

He stares through the door’s large window The bleak by-

seems unimpressed The human numbers in the farm have
started to dwindle (only ONE HUNDRED left) many of the blood
extraction slots are empty

me it was like a bolt of
lightening to my heart I could
feel it starting to beat again

I’ve never heard of a depolarized
heart responding to defibrillation

focuses

A defibrillator those electric
shock things that’s what it felt

Not really

Audrey walks in and joins the conversation
AUDREY
It’s the fermentation tank for that

Audrey points to Turner’s wine

SENATOR TURNER
Not a bad drop

ED
Fermentation that means it has to
be air tight right

AUDREY
That’s right

Ed notices a rectangular box mounted on the roof of the vat

He points directly at it

ED
And what’s that

AUDREY
An extraction fan It sucks out
the air to stop the wine from
oxidizing

Ed taps on the vat again

You said the second you were struck

electric-choker around its neck

Two of the soldiers are sliced in half as the creature lashes
out in self-defense Another soldier is quick to retaliate

but not with a weapon WITH HIS TEETH sinking them into the

creature’s deformed flesh

Frankie quickly takes aim firing his tranq gun twice Both
darts hit the beasts chest The Subsider drops hard

»ethe sound of rattling chains

In an undercover parking garage THIRTY MILITARY PERSONNEL
aim their weapons at FIFTY SUBSIDERS the creatures are
locked together in a chain gang They roar and lash out at
the officers Their attacks are held back with flaming
torches

The officers including Williams look famished their eyes
dark and deep set more Subsider than “healthy” vampire The
atmosphere is more like that of an out of control football
game than a military operation

Frankie locks the last Subsider in place

Without warning a Subsider lashes out at Frankie ripping
flesh from his shoulder Frankie swiftly pounds the creature
to the ground with the butt of his weapon

Frankie notices something familiar the “Flower of Life”
tattoo on the creature’s upper armit’s Alison

Frankie steps away Officers force Alison back on her feet

The chain gang is linked to a Military Hummer that drags the
Subsiders up the exit ramp towards daylight

EXT DENSE FOREST - DAY 175

A thick lush forest completely surrounds a narrow dirt
track

Elvis’ Firebird turns a corner the dirt path just wide
enough for the muscle car

In the distance towards the end of the path a haze of black
smoke drifts between the redwoods

Elvis Ed and Audrey instantly appear worried

The smoke becomes thicker as the car approaches The vehicle
reaches a clearing in front of a large log cabin

Pools of smoldering ashed bodies lay scattered across the
tangled grass This is the aftermath of a recent violent
battle

Alarmed the group warily exit the Firebird they carry
crossbows Elvis leads

They cautiously approach the cabin Elvis slowly opens the
door

INT CABIN - CONTINUOUS 176
SHOCK

Scattered across the cabin’s oak floor are the mauled bloody
bodies of the Stone’s Point humans

Many of their bodies have been drained of blood sucked dry
to the bone Terrified expressions frozen on their faces

The site of her massacred friends is unbearable for Audrey
she quickly turns away Ed grabs hold of her

Elvis is shocked speechless The site is horrific he
stumbles about to collapse He braces himself against the
door

Ed holds Audrey tight doing his best to keep it together
Then as he peers around the room he notices the decapitated
head of Senator Turner

EXT DENSE FOREST - DAY 177

The surrounding beauty of the lush forest is a sharp contrast
to the horror the group has just seen

Ed stares at the sun as it flickers through the swaying
Redwood branches

disinterested in her condition his focus is on the blood
dripping over the couch He needs to feed badly

Bromley strides towards a safe near the far wall

would discover a stable substitute

wrong
