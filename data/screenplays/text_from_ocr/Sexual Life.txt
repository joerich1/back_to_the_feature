EXT CITY SKYLINE - DAY

From an AERIAL VIEW we see the outline of a city Any
do Mirrored high rises Sprawling apartment

lot of people live herewhoever they are

As we move closer we discover that this is not a real
all but a scale model of one

Everything is in miniature -- the buildings parks and
GLIDING over this tabletop metropolis we find that
the buildings have roofs allowing us to peak inside

VARIOUS CLOSE ANGLES
We FLOAT through miniature coffee shops offices and

where toy figures are arranged in tableau of everyday

A man dines alone A woman walks her dog Two kiss on
One waits for a bus

Over this we HEAR Marianne Faithfuls smoky-voiced
standard When Were Alone

Just picture a penthouse Way up in the sky With hinges

For stars to go by A sweet slice of heaven For just
propriety There

When were

miniature

slender girl
place

Lorna

occupant

cat food

I When were alone
From all of society Well stay aloof And live in
on the roof Two heavenly hermits Well be in true
alone
As the song ends we find a miniature girl who lies on a
bed

A living room Lorna sits on the couch browsing the

wedding photos
She has a quizzical look as if the photos were of

some incomprehensible

alien culture The apartment is cluttered but not
dirty The

decor suggests an occupant of modest means and bohemian
taste
The occupant is TODD who ENTERS counting a wad of
money Late

He sets the money in front of Lorna

TODD
Seventy-five right For the half-hour

LORNA

TODD
And typically the size of the tip is

LORNA
Yeah Ive heard

TODD
And I like your name Lorna Like the cookie

LORNA

She laughs at him But its not unkind

LORNA (CONTD) (contd)

PHIL
Theres no comparison Here Ill do the math for you

Phil pulls a calculator out of his camera bag
PHIL (CONTD) (contd)

(punching in numbers)

A video rents for 265 Thats a two-day rental

That means
you can get off at least a couple times before its

due 125

I can

get off ninety-four times for the same amount you paid
to get

off once Now tell me who gets the better deal

Youre right I cant argue with that

The front pews are packed all eyes focussed on the
wedding party
at the altar Jerry and Rosalie face the priest who

blesses
the ring

The wedding ring is a powerful symbol It is a circle
with
no beginning and no end It is also the circle that
encloses

your love for each other--

TERRI

LORNA
Shhh

Jerry and Rosalie turn to face each other

PRIEST
Do you Rosalie take this man to have and to hold in
sickness
and in health till death do you part

ROSALIE

PRIEST
And do you Jerry take this woman to have and to
hold in sickness

Lorna studies Jerrys face for any sign any hint of

his real
feelings
JERRY
