SCHMIDT
Mangoing back to high school
What do you think Pretty nuts huh

JENKO
Honestly at first I was thinking
it would suck real hard But then I
was like it won’t

SCHMIDT
That’s very insightful But what do
you have to be worried about When
we were in high school you played
three sports you were invited to
all the parties you had sex with
basically every girl I dreamed of
even speaking to I mean this
should be pretty fucking easy for
you I’m the one who should be
freaked out about it

e Fe He FH FH
21 JUMP STREET PINK PRODUCTION DRAFT 5411

JENKO
Dude you should not be freaked
out You should be so pumped about
this

SCHMIDT
Why should I be pumped

JENKO
Remember Back to the Future II
When Biff had the almanac He knew
all the sports scores because he
had been to the future and he got
super rich and rode a floating
skateboard and got with Marty’s mom
and everybody loved him

SCHMIDT
That is an interesting takeaway
from that film

JENKO
You have the almanac You know how
high school works You don’t have
to worry about that shit anymore

SCHMIDT
I guess We didn’t reallyget
along that well in high school You
don’t you don’t think that’11l
happen again do you

Schmidt tosses him a few from his pocket Jenko opens a
bottle of PEACH SCHNAPPS and pours some out Then he opens
Lisa’s CAMERA and rips out the batteries and drops them in
the Schnapps bottle

JENKO
Lithium batteries react with
potassium nitrate It makes a
covalent bond

BLAMBLAMBLAMBLAM Domingo keeps firing at their car Jenko
opens the shells and pours GUNPOWDER into the Schnapps

JENKO (CONT’D)
That’s when two atoms share
electrons Each needs what the
other’s got and they join forces
It makes them stick together And
another thing about a covalent
bond It’s got a shitload of

energy
SCHMIDT
Youre saying we got a covalent
bond
JENKO

What No We’re not atoms dude

Jenko HURLS the SCHNAPPSATOV COCKTAIL into Domingo’s sunroof
SLOW MOTION TRIUMPHANT MUSIC and NOTHING

JENKO (CONTD)
Man It’s supposed to make this
whole big--
BOOOOOM An enormous fireball EXPLODES the limo The other

limos crash into a pipe and fire hydrant and skid out in the

bleeding from a hit to his shooting arm

MR WALTERS
