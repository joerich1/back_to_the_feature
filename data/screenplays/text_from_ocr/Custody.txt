Huh

PROSECUTOR
Your children Mr Stevens You do
realize you have children dont
you

RICK
Yes but

PROSECUTOR
But nothing Mr Stevens either you
have children or you dont

RICK
I do

PROSECUTOR
So you accept responsibility for
bringing young life into the world

RICK
I guess

PROSECUTOR
Theres no guessing Mr Stevens
either youre responsible for
siring offspring or you arent

RICK
I am but Im not sure it was
responsible

PROSECUTOR

A crime of passion Mr Stevens
How convenient
(A beat)
And you accept the consequences of
said actions

PROSECUTOR
Time is not an option Mr Stevens
Time --- is not --- an option

sad resignation crosses Ricks face

PROSECUTOR
You dont deny being married to Ms
Stevens nor do you deny the act of
procreation You seem to understand
that your actions bear consequence
You seem to understand that with
parenthood came responsibility

(MOR E)

PRO SECUT OR (contd)
It seems to me as it should to
anyone with the capacity for simple
deduction that you Mr Stevens
did willingly and knowingly enter
into the commitments of parenthood
fully aware of the potential
pratfalls Did you not

RICK
Yes yes I did

PROSECUTOR

Its time to pay the piper Mr
Stevens

(To the Judge)
It is the recommendation of the
State that Richard C Stevens been
sentenced to the fullest capacity
allowed by law

RICK
What about Cindy

responsibilities to the children

The Prosecutor moves to Rick and whispers in his ear

PROSECUTOR

She cut a deal Rick You were the

one we wanted You were the one we

got She took the plea Sure it

costs her financially But what is

freedom worth
A CLAMOR begins to rise from the crowd as they talk among
themselves The RAP of the gavel

JUDGE
I see no reason to extend this any
further Mr Stevens you have been
found competent by the State and by
this Court You are completely
cognizant of your surroundings and
you leave me no choice This court
finds you guilty as charged

RICK
Guilty of what

JUDGE
You are hereby remanded to custody
of your children for no less than a
lifetime This Court is adjourned

dumbfounded A BAILIFF approaches Rick and begins to lead

off stage Rick scuffles and struggles The Judge stands and
