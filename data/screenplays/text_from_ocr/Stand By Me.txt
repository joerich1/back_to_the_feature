NARRATOR (V0)
We all understood what Vern meant
right away

DISSOLVE TO

-EXT ‘TESSIO HOUSE - EARLIER THAT MORNING EST 5

The front porch runs the length of the house -
probably forty feet longand seven feet wide As the
Narrator talks we MOVE TOWARD a small door in the
lattice-work skirt that fences the underside of the
porch

NARRATOR (V0)
When Vern was eight he buried a
- quart jar of pennies under his
PEE perch He drew a treasure map so
he could find them again A week
later his mom cleaned gut his room
and threw away his map ‘

OUR VIEW ARRIVES at the small doorway and we
CU a
Ty TO u
UNDER THE PORCH

The ground looks like a prairie dog city with its
little holes and mounds of earth Halfway toward the
other end the twelve-year-old Vern is digging obses-
sively with a short handle hoe

NARRATOR (V0)
Vern had been trying to find those
pennies for four years Four
years man You didnt know
whether to laugh or cry

The SCREEN DOOR SLAMS open above him and Vern freezes
in midstroke TWO PAIRS OF FOOTSTEPS cross the porch
Carefully Vern moves his eyeballs to look through a
crack in the boards Its his brother BILLY and his
juvenile delinquent friend CHARLIE HOGAN -- both
sixteen

CHARLIE
(in a trembling
ery-baby voice)
Jesus Christ Billy we gotta do
something

BILLY

CHARLIE
But we saw him
BILLY
So Its nuthin to us The
kids dead so its nuthin to hin
neither Who gives a shit if they”

-girls didnt see hin

’ CHARLIE
But it was that kid they been
talking about on the radio

Verns head snaps around and he tries to get a look at
them through the lattice work

CHARLIE
(continuing)
Brocker Brower Flowers whatever
his name is Train must have hit
hin

BILLY
So

( )

NARRATOR (V0)
We had all followed the Ray Brower
story closely because he was a kid
our age Three days before hed
gone out to pick blueberries and
nobodyd seen him since

Billy lights a cigarette and flicks the match into the
gravel driveway Vern doesnt want to miss any of this
and begins to creep a little closer to the steps

CHARLIE
I think we should tell the cops

BILLY
You dontgo squawking to the cops
after you boosted a car Theyd
want to know how we got way the -
hell out on the Back Harlow Road
They know we aint got no car
Its better if we just keep our
mouths shut Then they cant
touch us

CHARLIE
We could make a nonnamus call

BILLY
They trace those calls stupid I
seen it on Highway Patrol and
Dragnet

CHARLIE
Yeah right I wish wed never
boosted that goddamned Dodge If
Aced been with us we could have
told the cops we was in his car

comes to a dead end by the Royal
River The train tracks are right

CHRIS
If theyd known you were under
there they would have killed you

Everybody nods in agreement Then the idea begins to
take hold

GORDIE
(musing)
Could he have gotten all the way
from Chamerlain to Harlow Thats
twenty or thirty miles

CHRIS
I think so He musta started
walking on the train tracks and
followed them the whole way

On the other side he almost lands on Teddy who is
doubled over and laughing like crazy At the same
instance Chopper hits the chain-link fence behind hin
and lets out a HOWL of mangled pain and disappointment

Gordie turns around holding one skinned kmee to get a

fence He is going about thirty miles an hour when he
hits it The whole FENCE makes a low MUSICAL SOUND

DISSOLVE TO

EXT RAILROAD TRESTLE - DAY 45

The rails run across a ridiculously narrow platform of
four-by-sixes supported by long frail-lLooking wooden
posts and crisscrossing beams Its sichty teet above
the water and 150 yards long ‘There is no more than
eighteen inches between thetrack andthe edge of the
trestle And there is no railing The thought of
crossing it on foot is terrifying And thats just
what is going through the boys minds as they look at
it from the solid ground at one end

An edgy silence falls over the boys as they think ahout
it Then Chris looks at Gordie with a crooked smile

CHRIS

What do you think Gordo
GORDIE

Danger is my middle name
TEDDY

Too cool
CHRIS

You wet- end Lachance Come on

They file out onto the trestle single file Teddy

first then Chris then Vern Gordie lets them go

S then kneeIs down and takes one of the steel rails

— firmly in his hand Its silent He steps onto the

ol trestle He watches his feet as he goes and between
the ties he can see the embankment drop away beneath
him and the rushing RIVER come INTO VIEW -

Teddy whos further out starts humming “circus” music
as he tightrope walks on one of the rails eighteen
inches from a fifty-foot drop

CHRIS
(continuing)
Goddamnit man get back in the
middle

With a pleased cackle Teddy steps down off the rail --
only to begin walking backwards down the middle of the
‘tracks

TEDDY
I could do this in my sleep

Suddenly Teddys right foot slips Stunned shock
registers on the others boys faces as they watch him
teeter on one foot then fall into the abyss between
two ties Chris lunges forward Desperately Teddy
twists himself in mid-air and at the last instant
manages to get both arms over the tie in front of
him His feet kick wildly looking for some support 45

Theres nothing below him but a fifty-foot drop to the
rocks of the river As Teddy struggles Chris quickly
steps around behind him stretches out on the ties
reaches down grabs the back of Teddys pants and
pulls him up

TEDDY
(continuing rising
to his feet with
Chris)
I wasnt gonna fall

CHRIS
Just stop screwing around okay 11

They look at each other Teddy Looks away first Then

Chris steps aside and lets Teddy go ahead He watches

him for a moment Subdued Teddy is walking more
carefully now Chris follows him With a small moan
in his throat Vern bends over puts his hand on the
ties and half-walks half-crawls forward Cautiously
Gordie brings up the rear

And with the crossties passing under them the boys
each in his own way work their way across the
trestle Gordie and Vern drop back because theyre
slower

From time to time they look up to see Chris and Teddy
surging further and further ahead Sweat runs in
rivulets off the boys bodies and their breathing comes
strained and harsh Chris and Teddy pass the midway
point

Verns hands come INTO VIEW Beneath the ties we can
see the river rushing fifty feet below them As the
rest of the him comes ‘INTO VIEW we see that his
crabbing motion down the tracks is working the comb out
of his shirt pocket He throws ‘his right hand up to
stop it this only succeeds in knocking it completely
out of his pocket It hits one of the ties Vern

stretches for it but it trickles off his fingers and
£alls fails Zalis into the river below

VERN
I lest the comp

GORDIE
Forget it Vern

S5A

s
Up ahead Chris stops and turns around to check on
Gordie and Vern They seem to be fine and he continues
on his way

Vern and Gordie pass the midway point Theres no
turning back now Slowly we become aware of the
NOISES around them -- the hot HUM OF A LOCUST the sigh
of the WIND the RACKET OF A BLUEJAY the TUMBLE OF THE
WATER below get bright and clear

( ) 45

Gordie lifts a hand to wipe the sweat off his face
That motion throws him off-balance He teeters toward
the edge then stumbles three ties forward before he
can catch himself Breathing hard he stops Sucking
deep breaths of air he composes himself He tries a
step then another and another then stops again His
head comes up His eyes widen

NARRATOR (V0)
Ive written books about people
who can read minds and precognit
the future But the closest I
ever came to that feeling myself
was that day on the trestle

As the Narrator talks we realize that a NEW NOISE has
entered our consciousness its a DISTANT LOW
RUMBLE Gordies head swivels as if testing the wind
then he forces himself to bend and make a fist around
the rail on his left It vibrates and THRUMS in his
hand His mouth opens but no sound comes out

In SUPER SLOW MOTION Gordie tries to rise It seems
to take him forever straining and straining upward
Finally he breaks into a BARE FRAME

GORDIE
(screams )
Train

The other boys heads snap around checking Gordie to
see if its a joke That question is answered
immediately by the engine of a freight that hurtles
INTO VIEW around a corner on the Castle Rock side of
the trestle

VERN
Aww shitl

Chris and Teddy take off Behind Vern Gordie breaks
into a clumsy shambling run Vern increasesthe speed
of his monkey walk But its not fast enough He
‘looks over his shoulder The train is getting closer
to the trestle

VERN
(continuing)
Awwww shit
He straightens up and ‘begins his own shuffling run

GORDIE ’
Go Vern Gol

( ) 45

Vern is holding his own when his left foot almost slips
into the yaw beneath him He flails his arms stumbles
again and falls full length on the tracks

GORDIE
(screams )
Vernl

Vern curls himself into a ball and begins to shake in
terror

GORDIE
(continuing)
Come on Verni Lets gol

Vern just looks at him Gordie checks on the train
its getting bigger

GORDIE
(continuing)
Goddamnit lets golll

He pulls vern up and pushes him forward

GORDIE
(continuing)
Goddamnit lets go

VERN
Iocantl Ill fallili

Gordie pushes him forward Instinctively Vern swings
out a foot it finds a tie his other follows it finds
atie again and again until hes running

GORDIE
(thumping Vern on
the back
Run you ‘pussy Runi
VERN

Awwwww shit
Gordie looks ahead to check on how far he has to go and
sees Chris and Teddy step off the ties onto the
embankment

GORDIE

Hanging onto their bedrolls Vern and Gordie run
Their muscles clench and loosen clench and loosen

Vern almost misses a crosstie lunges forward his arms
out Gordie whacks him on the back to keep him going

GORDIE

The trestle begins to shake under their feet --

“over his shoulder He and Vern are about to die

With a-superhuman effort Gordie grabs Vern and throws
both of them off the tracks toward the embankment
METAL SQUALLING AGAINST METAL the freight strobes

by Vern and Gordie land in the dust and cinders and
bury their faces in the hot earth The train passes

seated next to it reading his Vampire comic while be-
hind him the morning is pushing the night out of the
sky He is in no hurry to awaken the other boys sleep-
ing around the dead fire below him

A SLIGHT NOISE to his right causes him to look in that
direction‘andhe finds himself staring into the dark
dusty black eyes of a young deer She looks serenely
at him her head slightly lowered in curiosity - What

-she sees is a mesmerized kid with his hair in a sleep-

scarecrow of whirls and many-tined cowlicks wearing

Jeans with cufts and a brown khaki Shirt with the el-

They look at each other for a long time then with an
insouciant flip of her white bobtail she turns and
walks off to the other side of the tracks Gordies
eyes follow her She finds some grass and begins to
crop Not daring to breathe Gordie continues to watch
her Then the rail starts to THRUM under the gun and
hes suddenly afraid for her

VERN

They wave toVern over their shoulders as he walks away
from them In waving back he stumbles ever so slight-
ly on the curb Embarrassed he pretends it didnt
happen and without looking at them again continues on
his way An awkward silence settles on Chris Gordie
and Teddy

TEDDY

CHRIS
No way

TEDDY

And he continues down the street After several steps
we hears

TEDDY
(continuing singing)

Have gun will travel reads the
card of a man

A knight without armor in a savage
land

His fast gun for hire heeds the
calling wind

A soldier of fortune is the man
called Palladin

Chris and Gordie watch Teddy go then turn and walk off
in the opposite direction

NARRATOR (V0O)
As time went on we saw less and
less of Teddy and Vern until
eventually they became just two
more faces in the halls It
happens sometimes Friends can
come in and out of your life like
busboys in a restaurant
