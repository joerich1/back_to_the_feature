INT MRS BRUCES LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Decorated in Carol Brady chic When its not gaudy
and loud its blander than toast Colors like lime

and sunshine orange should be reserved for popsicles

MRS BRUCE late 30s enters looking exhausted She
a glass of wine in one hand and a book in the other

Bombecks The Grass Is Always Greener Over The Septic

HUMMING Weve Only Just Begun Mrs Bruce crouches
her wildly-ancient entertainment center complete with
She flips the first record forward on her Ronco Record
Album after album flaps forward Olivia Newton-John
Diamond the Osmond Brothers She stops on the

and sighs at the serene cover art Just what the doctor
ordered

Placing the vinyl on the turntable she CLICKS the

her wine opens the book and awaits the mellow tones of

Spindly

Suddenly her eardrums are hammered by machine gun
Caustic ROCK N ROLL assaults her senses She jumps
her wine all over herself This isnt the Carpenters
ITS KISS

Racing to the entertainment center she turns the
control knob so violently it comes off in her hand
music is even louder now

Flustered by the awful noise she tries lifting the
Its stuck She screams and covers her ears This is
Running to the rear of the huge console she stretches
reach the plug but cant Fingertips millimeters away
As the cacophony POUNDS she shakes the entire stereo
all her frantic might

SCREEEEEECH The needle scrapes across the vinyl with a
shrill finally coming to a stop Whew silence

Then POP the dustcover opens unceremoniously Shaken

grabs the record with trembling hands and reads the

KISS - LOVE GUN SIDE TWO

INT LEXS BASEMENTBEDROOM - NIGHT

An inner-sanctum of KISS devotion Faux-wood paneling
plastered with countless KISS posters pictures fold-
The ceiling is wallpapered with more KISS posters KISS
magazines records comic books clutter the shag-

floor Fast food wrappers heap over the KISS garbage

The four high schoolers rock their hearts out as they
a familiar tune offensively off-key
BOYS SINGING
IT wanna rock n roll all night and
party every day
They stink but they sure are trying hard Meet the

Mystery Concert tee-shirts holey jeans total burn-

HAWK a scraggily-haired disenchanted youth strains
vocal chords on the microphone as he SCRATCHES at his

TRIP STRUMS lead guitar like hes hammering nails All
Trip is slightly out of his mind But is it the

or just his chemistry He always wears a knit cap

JAM a sensitive kid (but no wuss) BASHES on his drums
a madman making the bass drum pulsate like a spastic
The big drum bears the word Mystery painted on its
with a lightning S just like the KISS logo

They bring the classic tune to a shrieking conclusion

thrust their hands over their heads in the KISS symbol
Hawk screams into the mike at their imaginary audience

HAWK
Thank you Cleveland Youre a great
crowd But after three and a half
hours of kick-ass rock and seven
encores on top of that Im sorry to
say that this time we really gotta
get back to our hotel rooms and fuck
some groupies

Behind him Trip grabs Lexs bass and swings it by the
at an amp pretending to bash it over and over again
quickly yanks it away from him

LEX

Jam emerges from behind the pile of drums smiling

anxiously

They sit for an uncomfortably long time until Mrs
pulls a cigarette and lighter out of her purse

MRS BRUCE
I made an appointment with Father
Phillip McNulty at St Bernards

will register you on the spot

JAM
You mean youre sending me to b-

youre no longer content merely
hearing their awful songs or looking
at photos of their horrific faces
Now you want to see the devil in the
flesh You want to reach out and
touch pure evil and in Detroit no
less

She flicks the lighter not yet lighting the cigarette

JAM
Mom three of those tickets dont
even belong to me Theyre for the
guys

Mrs Bruce holds the tickets over the lighters flame

MRS BRUCE
And if the guys have parents who
truly love them they will elevate
me to sainthood for getting rid of

Mrs Bruce lights her smoke with the flaming tickets
then

drops them in the ashtray where they burn for a cruel

eternity Jam stares semi-catatonic through his moms
sour

expression

MRS BRUCE

arm

Mr J stops when he sees the stain starting to spread

TRIP

We now see Trip is squeezing the pump from before He
holds

it behind him feeding water into the tube running down
the

back of his pants

The stain travels fast hitting Trips knee in a
nanosecond

In a state of shock Mr J slowly opens a long
forgotten

drawer on his desk finding a cobweb and dust-covered
pad of

bathroom passes He tears one off and dust flies
everywhere

He holds the pass out to Trip like it was a cross he
was
holding before an advancing vampire

They start stomping on the packets squirting Elviss
and torso with tomato-based condiment causing him to
a scream that lasts the rest of the scene Ketchup
across his body in SUPER SLOW MOTION A shot hits him
mouth and he COUGHS it back out in mid-scream

The boys stomp relentlessly mercilessly blasting
nemesis with hideous cafeteria red as Elvis throws his
back body quaking at every splat Its kind of like
scene in The Godfather where Sonny gets it

Beaten and spent his scream now dried up to a hoarse
Elvis slips on some ketchup at his feet He hits the
with a THUD right in the goop He lays there letting

wall

The name plate on his desk reads FR PHILIP McNULTY

FATHER MCNULTY
Before enrolling you Jeremiah let
me just say it would be greatly
appreciated if your career at St
Bernards was an uneventful one
Some students believe they can get
expelled through disobedience and
recklessness What they dont
understand is even after Gods
vengeance is meted out He forgives
That His devastating anger is followed
by His nurturing compassion In a
nutshell St Bernards may punish
you even for the slightest digression
but will never cast you out even
for the largest So here you are
Jeremiah here to stay

Father McNulty sticks the pencil into an electric
pencil

sharpener and it makes the same NOISE a DENTISTS DRILL
does
when burrowing into a molar Jam shudders

The Father removes the pencil and blows the shavings

away
from the needle-sharp tip

labelled
Donations While he looks for cash Hawk gives Jam a
discreet kick in the shin Jam looks up and recognizes
Hawk

He then looks out the window seeing Trip Lex and the
Volvo
below

For the first time we see what Jam looks like with a

big
fat shit-eating grin on his face
HAWK

If he offers you a slice youre not

Father McNulty swivels back around with a ten
FATHER MCNULTY
Heres ten and Im donating your tip

Hawk takes the ten tips the brim of the baseball cap
and
leaves giving Jam a cautious wink as he goes
FATHER MCNULTY
And not a moment too soon Im
famished I hope you brought a lunch
for yourself
JAM
No but Im not hungry anyway
Father McNulty raises his eyebrows then opens the
pizza
box
FATHER MCNULTY
Well It finally speaks Theres one
barrier weve broken through
Father McNulty smiles taking a big bite Jam smiles
for an
entirely different reason The priest mumbles with a
mouthful

FATHER MCNULTY
You know your coming here reminds
me of a gospel called The Prodigal
Son
Jam grins a bit feigning interest

FATHER MCNULTY
There was once a farmer who had two
sons Both grew up on the farm
helping their father until
(suddenly alarmed)
GYYAACK

Father McNulty GAGS sticking his pizza-covered tongue

out
He pours himself a glass of wine and sucks it down

the
story Its not every day you see a holy man tripping
on
shrooms
FATHER MCNULTY
(in mid-guffaw)
So then the younger one says But
dad Ive been helping you on the
farm my entire life
(belly laugh)
You never once slaughtered the fatted
calf for me And then
(more belly laughter)
Forgive me Jeremiah its just
that Ive been telling this gospel
for years and I just now realized
its the work of some comedy
mastermind The Prodigal Son is a
barrel of fucking monkeys
Father McNulty belly laughs so hard this time he
slides off
his chair hitting his chin on the edge of his desk He
is in
pain only momentarily then laughs again this time at
his
own pratfall He hoists himself back into his chair
Hawk Trip and Lex suddenly barge into the office

mess aint cleaned off my car

HAWK
It could bake on

Kenny looks at Bobby and they exchange moronic grins

KENNY

Youre a smart little homo arent
you hippie girl But while astounded
at your nimble friggin insight I
still detect an issue hanging fire
namely where does a sharp-witted
faggot like yourself get off doing
such a dopey thing like that there

Hawk figured out that any answer he gives will be

incorrect
and has decided to wait till Kennys done
KENNY
No really Im perplexed I mean
could you have done stupider if you
were born without a FUCKIN HEAD
CHRISTINE
(using oh to mean
enough)
Oh With the language
KENNY
Shut-up Christine

Kennys tempers rising faster than the price of
Hawk on the other hand is cooler than an Otter Pop

KENNY

Oh youre dumb all right you hairy
ass punk But please allow me to
clean the friggin windshield I
insist

And with that Kenny grabs himself a fistful of Hawks
hair and pulls him over to the Trans Am He wipes the
off with Hawks hair tugging Hawks head up and down
and forth Hawk GRUNTS with each wipe but doesnt give
the satisfaction of hearing him scream

Trip Lex and Jam watch helplessly trapped under
dull-witted but equally threatening gaze

Kenny gets the last of the big chunks off his

looks at his handiwork

KENNY
There Nice and clean

He throws Hawk to the ground and smiles at Bobby Then
suddenly hears the KISS tune coming from the Volvo Uh-
KENNY
Oh no no no Its the fag band
Kenny clenches his jaws and walks up to the Volvo

in the drivers door Suddenly Jam grabs his wrist
JAM
Whoa This is about pizza Lets
leave KISS out of it Please

KENNY
A bunch of guys who make bad music
dress like freaks and wear more
make-up than all my sisters combined
These assholes must be stopped

Kenny pushes Jam away

CHRISTINE
Thats it Kenny Im leaving

Christine gets out of the car and starts walking down

the
highway exiting the scene

Kenny meanwhile has his arm in the Volvo
KENNY
Kool and the Gang now theres real

Kenny takes the 8-track from the car
KENNY
But this is crap
He flings it into the highway where it is summarily
smashed
to bits under the wheels of a passing semi
FOLLOW a chunk of cartridge and a strand of mangled
tape
streaming from it as it sails back toward the side of
the

road landing at Jams feet
TILT UP to Jams face He raises his eyes and turns to
the

CAMERA a single tear rolling down his cheek just like
the

Indian in that Keep America Beautiful litter ad

Hawk rises and Kenny comes face-to-face with him

KENNY
So All that having been said and
done I believe we are ready for the
final topic of discussion Namely
Have you learned your lesson yet
puke

Hawk pulls a cigarette from his pocket and lights it
He
blows some smoke in Kennys face

HAWK

Well lets recap shall we You
slapped all of us yelled at me

haircut then yes Id say we
learned it

KENNY

Excuse me Im a little deef-a-

HAWK
Okay Ahem You Are A Dick With

eyes glaze over

HAWK
Its not huh Well then tell me

Hawk reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out his

empty can of Hawaiian Punch holding it discreetly at

side

HAWK
what exactly did my mother say
last night

Kenny draws a blank not being prepared for this one

HAWK
You heard me prick What did my
mother say last night

Kenny chuckles and looks at Bobby They have a good

laugh the homos got balls Then Kenny turns back to

KENNY
Okay fagmo Ill tell you what
your mother said last night
(beat)
She said that I was the fuck of her
life

Hawk is a little mad now He tosses his cigarette to

ground and squashes it like a bug under his sneaker

HAWK
(very Clint Eastwood)
How would you like a nice Hawaiian
Punch

KENNY

Quick as a shot Hawk SLAMS the bottom of the can into

DISSOLVE TO

spews from its tab hole like blood as Kenny falls

from the impact He hits his head on the ground

Taking this as a cue Trip whips out his wallet ona
chain Lex rips off his KISS belt And Jam yanks
drumsticks

As if choreographed Trip swoops the wallet at Bobbys
snagging him around the ankles tightly with the chain
THWAMS Bobby in the face with his big KISS belt buckle
a reversed red KISS logo branded in his forehead
Trip yanks the chain pulling Bobby off his feet When
hits the ground Jams right there DRUMMING his balls
Bobby shrieks

Meanwhile Hawk advances on Kenny who tries to get the
off his face but its stuck on looking like a pigs
with fruit punch for snot

Hawk raises both his hands in Kennys face then

the final insult Hawk messes Kennys hair Kenny

a scream that comes from the bottom of his vanity
Hawk grabs Kenny by the ears and brings the guidos

swiftly against his kneecap Kenny falls to the ground
unconscious on top of Bobby Their heads collide

Bobby out cold

Terrified Barbara leaps from the Trans Am and is

LEX
Not so fast stella

MOMENTS LATER
Kenny Bobby and Barbara are now tied to the guardrail

with
Jams white corduroy pants geeky belt and plaid
shirt
Kenny and Bobby rest their unconscious heads on each of
Barbaras shoulders
Hawk Trip Lex and Jam look down at the two guidos
and the
stella snickering
BARBARA
When they wake up theyre gonna
come looking for you jerks You best
hope they dont find you cause if
they do theyre gonna kick your
asses
Hawk grabs a cinderblock off the side of the road
walking

up to the Trans Am

HAWK
Right stella and well deserve it
But lets really make it worth their
while

Hawk puts the rock on the Trans Ams accelerator
letting the
engine WHINE in protest (Again we are cautious not to

show
the guidos faces)
HAWK
By the way when Kenny wakes up could
you give him a message for me Tell
him quote Kool and the gang bite
my bag motherfucker unquote
He throws the Trans Am into drive
All who are conscience listen to the brief SCREECH
then
watch the Trans Am as it barrels without a driver into
the
woods skirting the highway
It races into ditches bounces off trees and SPLASHES
through

ponds all Smokey and the Bandit-like
tumbles

way

has
Stanley

their

baggie of

few

The disco-mobile ramps off the edge of an embankment
down a steep rocky incline breaking apart along the
and finally BOOM It explodes on final impact

The boys all look at each other and shrug Hawk walks

to the Volvo and gets in Trip Lex and Jam follow

pile in as well Lex shouts back to Barbara

LEX

Oh thanks for letting us draw from

your ample make-up supply You must

have the entire Revlon factory in

your purse
ANGLE ON KENNY BOBBY AND BARBARA
We now see them from the front Lo-and-behold Kenny
been made-up like Gene Simmons Bobby like Paul
Whoever finds them is gonna get the wrong idea about

musical taste and kick their asses all over again

BARBARA
Very funny I hope you choke

STELLA ON BOARD
INT VOLVO - DAY
Hawk starts the engine and takes off Trip pulls a
weed and some rolling papers out

JAM
Hey look its that girl

Jam points out at the road ahead to Christine Shes a
hundred feet away walking sadly in the breakdown lane

TRIP
Thats no girl Thats a stella

JAM
Stella or no stella we should pull
over and help her out
HAWK
Oh no Jam Im not falling for that
twice

JAM
Well couldnt you slow down so I
can at least state my case Hawk If
you dont like it you can speed up
and Ill never mention it again

Hawk slows down turning into the breakdown lane
travelling

about two miles per hour Christine doesnt notice as
they

edge closer to her

LEX
What is it with you Jam You got a
thing for that thing

JAM
Shes a teenage girl walking on the
side of the highway They make very
scary movies that start out like
that

HAWK
Well they may not make movies about
four dudes going to a KISS concert
But if they ever did the four dudes
most certainly would not stop and
pick up a stranded disco bunny

Pause

TRIP
Unless there was gonna be a scene
where the disco bunny blows the four
dudes on the way to the show

INT VOLVO - DAY

Christine sits between Jam and Lex in the back SNAPPING
gum

Jam and Lex stare at her like cats looking at a fish
bowl

Hawk looks in the rearview mirror at Christine checking

herself in a compact She swathes on some 7-Up
flavored

Bonnie Bell lip gloss
Trip meanwhile twirls the joint hes just finished

rolling
in his mouth sealing it He winks at her disgustingly
CHRISTINE
Oh great I just hitched a ride
with a bunch of potheads Im
hooking up with some people at this
funky place in downtown Detroit called
Disco Inferno Mind droppin me there
TRIP
(smirks)
Whats it worth to you
CHRISTINE
(grossed out)
What the hell is that supposed to
mean
JAM
It doesnt mean anything Dont pay
attention to him
HAWK
(rolls his eyes)
Disco Inferno Discos infernal
morelike
Trying to be suave Lex moves in close putting the
make on

her

LEX
Your clothes may say disco but your
eyes say rock n roll baby

CHRISTINE
Well your tee-shirt may say rock
n roll but your breath says
pepperoni baby

She pushes him away Jam laughs

TRIP
(frustrated)
So are you like gonna polish our
nobs or what

CHRISTINE
(thoroughly offended)
What Thats disgusting

JAM
Trip Thats so fuckin rude man

TRIP
Oh quit bein the wussy sensitive
guy to impress her Jam Shes
obviously not gonna put out Shes a
fuckin tease

CHRISTINE
Tease What the hell did I do to
tease you mongoloids

TRIP
You got in the car didnt you

CHRISTINE
Oh God how calculating of me to
lead you all on like that after you
offered me a ride in the middle of
nowhere

TRIP
Whatever stella

Trip lights the joint and takes a lungful of pot He

passes
it to Lex and the joint begins to make its rounds with
the
exception of Christine The car starts to fill with
smoke

CHRISTINE
The names Christine not stella
And theres no need to be such pigs
just cause I prefer Donna Summer or
KC and the Sunshine Boys or the
Village People over KISS

HAWK
(with disdain)
The Village People Theyre fags
Youre a fag hag

JAM
Come on Hawk

CHRISTINE
I can take care of myself but thanks
anyway germ
JAM
Jam

CHRISTINE

Whatever

(to Hawk)
Okay Joe Burnout lets get one
thing straight here As far as Im
concerned good tunes is good tunes
be it disco or rock or polka or
whatever have you regardless of the
category True if I had to choose
Id pick the category labelled disco
because I happen to enjoy dancing
Disco is just easier to dance to

HAWK
You call that John TravoltaDenny
Terio shit dancing I wouldnt dance
like that in private if you paid me

TRIP
Disco blows dogs for quarters

Christine processes this remark

CHRISTINE
Now theres an intelligently biting
remark wrought with wit and irony

Trip looks confused then smiles thinking she paid him
compliment

HAWK
Hey if you dont like that one
maybe youll think its funny when
we throw your ass out the goddamn
car

CHRISTINE
Yeah why dont you put your money
where your mouth is

HAWK
Why dont you kiss my hairy crack

CHRISTINE
Why dont you bend over youre
looking right at it
All Christine included pause to think about what that
comment was supposed to mean Lex takes a hit off the

joint
LEX
(holding in smoke)
That last remark fell about 30 yards
away from making any sense whatsoever
Hawk and Trip immediately bust into the giggles and it
doesnt
take long for Lex and Jam to follow suit
CHRISTINE
(realization)
Hey youre right Bend over youre
looking right at it
(starts to laugh)
Whats that supposed to mean anyway
Christine succumbs to the contagious giggle epidemic
and the
whole car gets a great laugh for a while
They finally calm down again and wipe tears from their
eyes
Lex still has the joint now as Christine looks at it
CHRISTINE
Man this is some kickass shit
(beat)
Gimme a hit off that jay will ya
Lex smiles despite himself and holds the weed out to
her as

CROWD of KISS fans continually meander by
On their way to the car they suddenly hear a WOMANS

VOICE
bellowing through a megaphone from somewhere down the
street
After a moment they see the voices source
A GROUP OF WOMEN has congregated about forty feet ahead
and
their LEADER her back toward the boys yells to the
group
through her bullhorn Flying above them all is a large
banner
reading MATMOK Mothers Against The Music Of KISS

Look around you tonight

mothers

Look at all the young faces They
smile and laugh but their eyes have
lost all hope Not one among them
appears to possess the love and fear
of God This satanic group KISS

has stolen their souls

The leaders gaze finally falls upon Jam He lets out a

Yes the leader is Mrs Bruce So this was her church

She freezes when she sees her son

her jaw slackens

Jam looks stunned beyond comprehension

JAM
Oh dear Lord

Mrs Bruce quickly hands the megaphone to another

member who picks up where Mrs Bruce left off

Jam looks around for someplace to run and hide but
late Mrs Bruce slices through the crowd of KISS fans
and

grabs Jam by the ear He yelps

MRS BRUCE
I dont know how you got here tonight
and I dont want to know either All
I know is youre going to pay dearly
for this one young man

EXT ST SEBASTIANS CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

He looks around catching the eye of a pretty CASHIER

a rocker wearing a Who tee-shirt a mood ring and
little too much make-up She smiles at him Trip

smile with a feeble wave Her mood ring turns from blue
pink

Concentrating on the layout of the store Trip peers
way to the back to a darkened corner where he spies
LITTLE KID wearing a KISS tee-shirt playing a KISS
machine

Trip smiles The eagle has spotted a fuzzy little
moves in for the kill walking past a crowd of kids at
magazine rack past the Hostess aisle past the dairy
and into the darkened corner

He stands behind the little kid relishing this moment
kid is actually pretty good We also see now the little
has his face painted like Ace Frehley

TRIP

Suddenly distracted the kid loses the ball
LITTLE KID

Trip clamps a hand over the little kids mouth
TRIP
Okay booger your KISS ticket or

The little kid says something but Trips hand muffles
words

TRIP
Hunh

The kid says what he said before but it is utterly
incomprehensible once again thanks to Trips hand

TRIP
(looking at his hand)
Oh Okay But scream and youll

The little kid taps his finger on his chin and the

from JEOPARDY begins While the kid thinks Trip

nervously up at Chongo and his buds Chongo reaches
denim vest pocket and we hear a CRINKLING NOISE He
back up with two walnuts putting them between his
forearm

Trip watches in horror as Chongo makes a muscle and the
walnuts are shelled between two walls of iron-hard

CREEEAAAACK Chongo eats the walnuts shells and all

scaffolding wait their turn to be carried into the

Jam sits in the front pew head buried in his hands as
Bruce and the priest talk on the alter
Beth moves quietly in the back unseen and unheard She
overwhelmed by the architecture the detail on the

The priest catches a glimpse of Beth meandering in the

MRS BRUCE

Jam kneels on the board and a mere two feet behind him
sits on a bench shrouded in darkness Her posture is
someone with a crate of nitroglycerine on her lap
We hear the SHUFFLING noise of the priest getting into
own compartment next door A moment later the small
level door SLIDES open The priests face is barely
on the other side of the thick screen but hes there
JAM
Forgive me Father for I have sinned
This is my first confession in

PRIEST
Prepare to receive the Act of Penance
How many sins have you committed
since your last confession
JAM
Just one Father but boy was it a

INT ITS RAINING MEN STRIP JOINT - NIGHT
Hawks at a bar stool gulping sloppily and woozily from
rocks glass Four more empty rocks glasses sit in front
him He stares at the sexy woman who smiles back
him kisses from the other side of the bar
The EMCEE enters the stage
EMCEE
(into microphone)

Okay ladies hang onto your hormones

Here comes our next amateur Lets

have a big hand for Hawk

The beginning of a rockin KISS tune comes over the

Dicky approaches Hawk
EMCEE
Youre up Hawk

Hawk wakes up fast Theres nothing more sobering than
having
to undress in public

HAWK
Oh Dicky I c-c-cant

BARTENDER
Youre not gonna chicken out on me
now are you Weve got your KISS
song playing and everything

HAWK
I-I c-cant

BARTENDER

(leans in close)
Look people undress in public
because A theyre exhibitionists
B theyre nutcases or C they need
the money I can tell youre not A
and I hope to hell youre not B So
my suggestion is think about why
youre a C and let your body party
shake your groove thing boogie oogie
oogie till you just cant boogie no
more

Hawk thinks about it then downs the rest of his drink
He

grimaces at its taste then opens his eyes with new
resolve

HAWK
Youre right Dicky I gotta do it
for KISS Gotta put a bag over its
head and
(hiccup)
Do it for KISS

Hawk swivels his bar stool to the right and gets off

forgetting to stand when his feet hit the floor He
proceeds

to fall flat on his face Dicky looks down concerned
but

Hawk stands with a little difficulty and heads for the
stage

Hawk looks nervously at the carnivorous faces leering

package first his ass after What the hell is he

Hawk reluctantly climbs onto the stage and the gals
CLAPPING to the song He faces them and starts gyrating

drunken hips at them feeling no confidence whatsoever
until

The CHEERS start to ECHO and the pulsing lights begin
hurt his eyes Hawk watches the world proceed to spin
than the disco ball above his head

He stops gyrating and clutches his stomach BELCHING

Hawk spots an almost-empty beer pitcher one of the
IN-SLOW-MOTION women holds above her head He runs up
edge of the stage grabs the pitcher and PUKES

The cheering and music come to a grinding halt You can
a pin drop as Hawk yacks his guts out into the beer

It goes on for an excruciatingly long time then

stops

Hawk looks up at the hundreds of astonished eyes

him He wipes his mouth then a look of ease washes
face

HAWK
Wow I feel a hundred times better

He hands the vomit-filled pitcher back to the shocked

He segues into a Mick Jagger rooster strut and the

Then Hawk goes for the gold Yes he does the Fonzie

The women are now overcome by sheer animal lust Hawks

PRIEST

Thats it
JAM

Yeah
PRIEST

Well this is a unique confession to
say the least son And not exactly
the most interesting one Ive ever
heard either You sure you dont

want to talk about oh carnal
knowledge with a neighborhood girl

or impure thoughts about the new
student teacher maybe or how about
finding a box of magazines under

your dads bed

JAM
No

PRIEST
Well then I suggest you have a seat
on the bench behind you and think of
something a little juicier to confess
than losing KISS tickets I realize
this is Detroit but I personally
find what that rock and roll band
is all about to be boring as

bulge He cant believe what hes seeing He climbs off
and sits next to her
JAM

intense Forgive me

JAM

They kiss sweat and PANT heavily

Suddenly the sliding door to the priests booth opens

Trip leafs through a KISS comic not really paying
attention
to it Directly behind him is the register and the
CASHIER
He starts hearing voices in his head We see SUPERS of
his

friends faces hovering around him

LEXS VOICE
I cant believe youre even thinking

plays with her mood ring He gives her the eye then
to his comic

JAMS VOICE

And what about that girl Trip Shell

get away with it shell be scarred

for life When are you gonna realize

tender

TRIP
(to the other voices)
Alright everybody SHUT UP

Trip snaps out of it All the shoppers and cashier are
starring at him He COUGHS loudly clearing his throat

cover his outburst The shoppers go back to shopping
A MAN WITH A LONG COAT enters the store looks around
takes a spot alongside Trip and opens a Mad Magazine
TRIP
(whispering to himself)

Okay bro You gonna have to do this

sometime Might as well be now
Trip puts a hand in his pocket and takes one last look
Stretch Armstrong before stuffing the action figure

so it looks like hes got a gun He takes three deep

and discreetly pulls his knit cap down over his eyes
revealing it actually as a semi-ski mask that covers

half of his face
Just then the man with the coat puts the magazine back

pulls something over his own head
Trip whirls around pointing Stretch-in-his-pocket at

the

cashier

Just as the man in the coat now masked with a
stocking

pulls the biggest shotgun ever made from under his
coat

pointing it at the cashier as well The cashier
shrieks So
does Trip

MAN WITH COAT

Evening honey Yknow what I am
what this is and what you have to
do so do it quick

(to shoppers Trip

included)
The rest of you kindly introduce
yourselves to the floor and kiss it

His thunder now stolen Trip drops to the floor along

with
everyone else The air is very tense The cashier
starts
SOBBING keeping her hands in the air
MAN WITH COAT
(to cashier)
Do or die bitch Next time I let
the barrels do the talking
CASHIER
P-p-please mister Im just a high
school kid
Man with the coat COCKS the chamber and the cashier
immediately opens the register drawer and starts

CRASHING BACKSTAGE

INT COBO HALLBACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Your wildest fantasy of a rock shows backstage area

true The place is packed with beautiful people

clad BABES everywhere

Lots of booze Lots of fun

CAMERA TILTS UP above
along an exposed duct

Looking straight down
disbelief

Slick RECORD BIZ-TYPES Lots of

Its backstage at a KISS

the partying hordes to find Lex

amid the pipes sprinklers and

on everybody

Lex is in awe and
This is real This is not a dream
This is real Ive pierced the inner
circle

He takes the opportunity to peer down some BIG BUSTED

GIRLS

cleavage Then his eye spots something else He GASPS
A

door On it a star Written on the star the word
KISS

LEX
Oh God theyre in there

A big-haired HIPSTER in mirrored sunglasses KNOCKS on
the

dressing room door It opens but Lex cant see inside
The

hipster stands in the doorway talking to whoever is
there

Lex cranes his neck to see around the door jamb
Desperate

for a glimpse of his idols he leans out too far

Suddenly the entire duct collapses Breaking loose of
the

ceiling Lex hurls to the floor clutching the duct
Backstage

goers leap for cover as SMASH he hits the ground in
a

shower of plaster and dust

The hipster protectively pulls the dressing room door
shut

as two SECURITY MEN jump in front of it

Instantly huge burly hands come down on Lexs
shoulders

Before he can react a slew of OFFICERS have him off
his

feet and carry him away a stunned expression frozen to
his

face

EXT ALLEY BEHIND COBO HALL - NIGHT

Lex is thrown into a heaping garbage dumpster by the
scruff

of his neck The security officers laugh and pat
themselves

on the back as they hurry back in
jumps
biggest

bared and

PITBULL

from

like

the
mutts

snaps

Lex peeks out the lid The alley is dark and spooky He
out of the trash and comes face to face with the
GERMAN SHEPHERD that has ever lived Its teeth are

its black wolf-like body is coiled ready to spring
GRRRRRRR

Lex jumps backward hitting the dumpster A GROWLING
walks out from the shadows and joins the Shepherd
LEX
(petrified)
Dogs Why did it have to be dogs

Then a GROWLING DOBERMAN with a spiked collar emerges

the darkness on the other side of the alley its solid
muscular form making the brick building nearby look

jello
Lex starts SLAPPING himself on the face
LEX
Wake up Lex Wake up man This
parts gotta be a nightmare
No luck He stops when several other DOGS emerge from
shadows and gather behind the first three These new
immediately join in the GROWLING chorale The Shepherd
at Lex
LEX
(to the heavens)
God if you ever get me outta this

I swear I will never masturbate again

The pack BARKS even louder
LEX
(to heaven again)

I REALLY MEAN IT THIS TIME

whisper

BETH

Meanwhile an unnoticed dog at the rear of the pack a

a twig in a flood and over the shoulders of those in

landing on his stomach between Paul and Gene Just

Peters drum solo is about to start
Gene Paul and Ace silence their instruments Peter
his drumstick into the air intending to catch it when

comes down But the sight of Jam landing on the stage
distracts him

All is mute as Peter misses the drumstick It hits the
edge of one of the drums

Thinking fast Jam grabs one of his drumsticks out of
sock and tosses it to Peter It tumbles through the air
SLOW MOTION with a LOW WHOOPING HELICOPTER SOUND We
the word Mystery clearly as it twirls

Instantly its caught in Peter Crisss hand and he

it down on his drum not missing a beat The song

with all its fury as Peters drum kit ascends on a

Jam scrambles from the stage and leaps back into the
barely missing the claws of some security guards

The four friends pound on each other with unbridled
