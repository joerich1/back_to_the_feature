INT HOTEL ROOM SKY RISE -- CONTINUOUS

A WOMAN mid 20’s enters the room revealing a breath-taking
view of Toronto -- specifically the CN Tower -- the world’s
tallest free-standing structure

When she enters the bedroom suite she starts feeling dizzy
nauseous and begins losing her balance The room becomes
blurry and she kneels to the ground holding her stomach

She writhes on the floor for a moment COUGHING before
crawling towards the phone

As she slides against the side of the bed reaching for the
phone someone’s hand GRABS her wrist and gently pulls it
away

Two MEN IN GAS-MASKS stand over her One of them VICTOR
KOZLOW 30’s kneels over her as she GASPS for air His
comrade BECKER 30’s searches through her suitcase

Kozlow holds up a small plastic gas-mask and places it over
her nose and mouth She begins breathing much easier

Kozlow calmly SPEAKS with a Ukrainian accent

KOZLOW
Where is the Locust

The woman’s breaths turn into a slight LAUGH Finally

WOMAN
Beyond your reach
KOZLOW
So you do know where the Locust

is
The woman nods

KOZLOW (CONTD)
Then where is he

WOMAN
(smiles )
Beyond your reach

Kozlow removes the mask causing the Woman to GASP for air
again He watches her as she begins to tremble

KOZLOW
Your room is poisoned with Chlorine
gas

(MORE)
KOZLOW (CONTD)
What you’re feeling right now is
your nervous system deteriorating
If you answer my question
correctly you can keep the mask
If not I will keep the mask Do
you understand

The woman nods again
Kozlow places the mask back on her face

KOZLOW (CONTD)
Now I’1ll ask you one more time

WOMAN
And in that one time youll get
the same answer
The woman RIPS the mask off and tosses it under the bed

KOZLOW
Stupid girl

She SPITS on Kozlow who SLAPS her back
BECKER
(in Ukrainian)
I found it
Becker finds a gray folder in her suitcase and brings it
over to Kozlow Kozlow opens the folder and scans the
content Valuable information is inside

Meanwhile the Toronto POLICE arrive down below -- SIRENS
blaring

BECKER (CONTD)
(in Ukrainian)
Let’s go Come on

Kozlow looks back at the woman as she slowly dies in front
of him

BECKER (CONTD)
There’s no time

Kozlow stares at the woman as tears stream down her face
Finally she takes her last breath

Kozlow checks her pulse -- she’s dead

Kozlow rises grabs the gray folder and exits the room with
Becker They both turn to SLOW MOTION as the opening riff of

“American Woman” begins

CLOSE UP The Woman’s face eyes open dead to the world
When the song KICKS in --
BLACKOUT

CREDITS BEGIN

INT CAR -- NIGHT

“American Woman” continues on the radio as three TEENAGERS
drive down the highway GILLY 18 (male) longish hair
drives while JAKE 17 heavy set sits in the passenger seat

NATHAN HARPER 18 tee-shirt-and-jeans type sits in the back
seat looking out the window

Jake and Gilly are LAUGHING as they pass a joint around the
car When they offer it to Nathan he passes

Gilly SINGS along with the song while Nathan and Jake LAUGH
at him

They pass a road sign which reads Bridgewater Virginia

Nathan Gilly and Jake squeeze through the CROWD looking for
the kitchen

GILLY

Gilly approaches two JOCKS 18 with their football jackets
on

JOCK 1

Gilly takes out two fake Virginia IDs with both of the
jocks’ pictures on them
Jock 2 grabs his ID and looks it over -- he’s impressed

JOCK 2

GILLY
Fifty each

The Jocks shell out the cash and hand it over

GILLY (CONTD)
Welcome to your twenties

Suddenly Nathan accidentally BUMPS into KAREN LOWELL 18
gorgeous brunette They look at each other as she tries to
get by him

NATHAN
(awkwardly )
Hi

Karens boyfriend BILLY WILKINSON 19 slightly pushes
Nathan out of the way so he and Karen can get by

Karen LAUGHS a little at Nathan and then disappears into the
CROWD with Billy

GILLY

They tap and drink

NATHAN

GILLY AND JAKE

They tap and drink

EXT FRONT LAWN -- MORNING

Nathan lies face down on the front lawn passed out holding
a plastic cup with beer

A teenage GIRL walks by Nathan with a garbage bag and takes
the cup out of his hand She lightly KICKS him to wake him

up

Nathan slowly raises his head with a line of drool coming
out He squints up at the girl in the sunlight

GIRL
Wake up whoever you are my
parents are gonna be here in an
hour You gotta get out of here

As she walks away Nathan looks around He has no idea where
he is

NATHAN
Shit

CREDITS END

INT NATHAN’S CAR -- LATE MORNING

Nathan’s dad KEVIN HARPER 40’s drives the car while
Nathan sits in the passenger seat

KEVIN
Nathan under the description for
‘dad does it say he has to pick
up his drunken son from random
people’s front lawns as a general
rule Because this is the third
time this year

NATHAN
Please don’t tell mom

KEVIN
Mom already knows

Nathan hangs his head down
NATHAN

It’s not my fault they keep leaving
me on the front lawn
KEVIN
It’s your fault you keep trusting
them to bring you home

NATHAN
Yeah I guess

KEVIN
They’re having a laugh at your
expense Which is all fine and
good But trust needs to be
earned

NATHAN
Like I trust you’1l tell mom I
wasn’t drinking

Kevin LAUGHS

KEVIN
Not gonna happen You’re on your
own kiddo

NATHAN
Don’t you have any power in our
household

KEVIN
(beat)
Nope

Nathan looks at his father in discouragement

NATHAN (VO)
Do you know these people who live
in your house and cook your
dinners and fold your underwear
Because I sure don’t

INT DR BENNETT’S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

Dr Bennett 50 glasses sits across from Nathan listening
to him explain his plight

NATHAN
They look like you they talk like
you but they’re not really on
your team you know It’s like
it’s you against them

DR BENNETT
I think everyone feels that way
growing up

NATHAN
Does everyone go to a shrink
DR BENNETT
Not everyone has insomnia or
anxiety attacks at your age
Sometimes it just helps to talk
about it

NATHAN
What else is there to talk about
It’s all been said before

DR BENNETT
The nightmare The recurring one
You said there was something
different about it this time

NATHAN
There was

Dr Bennett presses “record” on a mini-CD player placed on
the coffee table

NATHAN (CONTD)
It’s the same as always A woman
standing in the shadows is singing
me a lullaby While she’s singing
it to me a single tear drops from
her eyes and falls onto my arm
And then she backs away from me
and disappears Leaving me alone
in the dark

DR BENNETT
So what’s the difference between
this nightmare and the rest

NATHAN
The difference is it wasn’t a
nightmare

DR BENNETT
Because it didn’t scare you

NATHAN
Because I wasn’t asleep It’s just
something that popped into my head
the other day like a memory

DR BENNETT
Well maybe you just remember
dreaming it

NATHAN
Or maybe it was never a dream
Because there isn’t a day that goes
by when I don’t wake up and check
my arm for that teardrop
INT NATHAN’S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
Nathan listens to loud PUNK MUSIC while doing his homework

His mother MARA HARPER 40’s enters the room She turns off
his iPod stereo and sits on his bed

Nathan looks at her

NATHAN
Sorry

MARA
It’s not the drinking that bothers
me I was a teenager once too I
absolutely get it But it’s
becoming too much of a regular

thing
NATHAN

So you’re not grounding me
MARA

You’re grounded for the weekend
NATHAN

How about just until tomorrow
MARA

No way
NATHAN

Saturday
MARA

Nope
NATHAN

roof so you don’t have to yell at
dad to do it anymore

MARA

Mara gets up to leave

NATHAN
(smiles )
I love you mom

MARA
Uh huh Try to get some sleep
tonight for once
INT SCHOOL HALLWAY -- MORNING

Nathan and Gilly open their prospective lockers As Nathan
takes out his books he notices Gilly’s locker is filled with
an array of pictures of rifles and automatic weapons

NATHAN
What the hell is that

GILLY
The Maritime kidnapper Another
kid disappeared just two towns
over I’m thinking about getting
some protection

NATHAN
The Maritime kidnapper abducts
kindergartners and infants You
might be just a little outside his
demographic

GILLY
You can never be too sure
(motioning to a particular
firearm)
Check this out -- M82 automatic
sniper rifle Shoots a ten round
clip in under a minute My dad has
this exact gun up in his den You
could wipe out an entire
neighborhood with it

NATHAN
I think maybe you have a problem

Nathan diverts his attention to Karen Lowell standing across
the hallway She’s CONVERSING with her CHEERLEADER FRIENDS
at her locker

Gilly notices Nathan staring at her

GILLY
She’s your next door neighbor now
dude

NATHAN

Yup three weeks Hasn’t said “hi”
to me once

GILLY
Man Id be checking out her
bedroom window constantly

NATHAN
That’s what scares me about you

INT CLASSROOM -- DAY

MR MILES 50s glasses dry humor is in session with 30
High School STUDENTS

Nathan Gilly Jake and Karen are all in attendance as Mr
Miles SPEAKS

MR MILES
Well I’m sure you’ve all heard
about the Maritime kidnapper He
struck again last night Fifth
child in less than three months

Mr Miles removes a Playboy magazine from inside Jake’s open
textbook

MR MILES (CONTD)
I’m considering having you all
write an essay on him if you don’t
get your grades up soon

Mr Miles SLAPS a ruler on a SLEEPING STUDENT’S desk
awakening him

MR MILES (CONTD)
You may think this class is a
bullshit elective people but it
goes on your report card all the
same All I’m asking for is to
raise you average class grade above
a ‘C’ In case you don’t
remember a ‘C’ is a fairly low
shitty grade It shouldn’t be too
hard to rise above it

SNORING can be heard from the back of the room
MR MILES (CONTD)
Somehow I’m sure you’re gonna
screw this up

Nathan also starts dozing off

DREAM SEQUENCE

INT DARK BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Nathan lies in bed while a SHADOWED WOMAN sits next to him
As the rain outside POUNDS against the window the woman
SINGS to Nathan in a kind but eerie way

SHADOWED WOMAN
(echo-y)
Que Sera Sera
Whatever will be will be
The futures not ours to see
Que Sera Sera
What will be will be

Nathan reaches out to touch her face but his hand goes right
through her Shes a ghost

END OF DREAM

Nathan wakes up in a sweat

He looks disheveled -- wipes his eyes He cracks open a
prescription bottle and swallows a couple pills

A car can be heard PULLING up next door

Nathan goes to the window and sees Karen Lowell getting out
of the car and ARGUING with her boyfriend BILLY in the
driveway

Eventually Billy DRIVES off in a huff

EXT ROOF -- LATE MORNING

Nathan adjusts some new shingles on the roof with his iPod

The sun shines bright and the roof tar is sticky

Karen grabs her iPhone and aims it at Nathan -- hits RECORD

EXT ROOF -- SIMULTANEOUS

NATHAN
(chanting)
“Or just another country
Another council tenancy”

Nathan loves the song -- gets more into it

NATHAN (CONTD)
(chanting)
“And I wanna be anarchy And I
wanna be anarchy”

Finally he turns his head towards Karen’s house

NATHAN’S POV Karen and her friends LAUGHING at him
Nathan doesn’t really mind -- half smiles back at Karen
Suddenly a shingle SLIPS from underneath his foot and he
loses his grasp ripping off two more shingles He SLIDES
down the roof and FLIPS over the side of the house barely
catching the gutter

Dangling from the gutter Nathan desperately tries to reach
for the roof’s edge but the gutter BENDS back and SNAPS in

half causing Nathan to FALL twenty feet into the bushes
BAM

INT KAREN’S BEDROOM -- SIMULTANEOUS

Karen and her friends are LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY They can
barely catch their breath

girlfriends LAUGHING next door He lifts up his iPod -- it’s
broken

NATHAN

As Nathan walks through the hallway towards his locker he
notices other STUDENTS looking at him weird -- WHISPERING
GIGGLING and parting ways as he walks by

When he reaches his locker Gilly is grabbing his textbooks
from the adjacent locker Gilly also looks at Nathan
strangely

NATHAN
What’s going on
GILLY

GILLY

Dude You’re a YouTube sensation

INT COMPUTER ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Nathan enters the Tech room -- some FRESHMEN are watching a

LAUGHING when they notice him standing right behind them

They back off so he can watch the video

the bushes

Nathan quickly grabs the mouse and scrolls the page

Nathan SLAMS the mouse on the desk and storms out of the
room

INT GYMNASIUM -- DAY

Nathan barges into a packed gym class walking directly
towards Karen Lowell who’s GIGGLING with her five
GIRLFRIENDS

The whole CLASS parts like the Red Sea when Nathan approaches
Karen Everyone turns silent as he looks straight at Karen
dead in the eyes

NATHAN
Must be nice to be the toast of the
day but I guess that’s nothing new
for you You’re a popular girl
and you play the role well
Complete with the obedient cronies
and the college boyfriend But in
the end it’s just a role

KAREN
You don’t know anything about me

NATHAN
Seventh grade Science class We
were lab partners You told me you
wanted to be an archeologist You
were cool What ever happened to
that girl Traded it in for a pair
of pom-poms

KAREN
I take it you can’t take a joke

NATHAN
I may have looked like an idiot
falling into those bushes but at
least I know who I am

KAREN
Really Is that what your
therapist tells you

SNICKERING can be heard as Nathan tries to stay calm

NATHAN
I guess it’s hard to keep secrets
in a small town But I won’t be

here for long How ‘bout you
Community College Summer job at
the Gap I’1l be sure to drop by
in three years when they promote
you to Manager

KAREN
Who cares if you leave this town
or not It’s not like anyone would
remember you anyway

Nathan’s genuinely hurt by this comment Karen immediately
regrets saying it

Nathan looks around -- EVERYONE staring at him A profound
feeling of alienation sets in

Finally he walks away leaving the room in stunned silence
INT CLASSROOM -- DAY

Mr Miles WRITES a large ‘D’ on the chalkboard under

average class grade

Nathan looks out the window as Mr

Karen looks sullen

Miles SPEAKS

The bell RINGS

MR MILES
Your mission should you choose to
accept it is to write a four page
essay on the subject of missing
children Percentage of
disappearance rate how often
they’re found under what
circumstances Etc Etc

The room GROANS ERNESTO 17 raises his hand

MR MILES (CONT’D)

ERNESTO
(smiles )
What if we choose not to accept it

MR MILES

mi amigo On the semester And
remember people Wikipedia is not
your friend I want the cold hard
facts on this one And I want them
by Friday

The room GROANS more

MR MILES (CONTD)
I know I know Your lives are
destroyed forever But to lessen
the workload I’m going to let each
of you partner up with someone on
this one and then you can share
the responsibility as well as the
grade Fair enough

MR MILES (CONTD)
I also want one page dedicated to a
specific incident of a missing
child in the United States within
the past thirty years NOT the
Maritime kidnapper

(beat)
(MORE)

Everyone starts to gather their textbooks

MR MILES (CONTD)
If anyone wants to donate an apple
or a candy bar to me you may do so
at this time

EXT HALLWAY KAREN’S LOCKER -- MOMENTS LATER

Karen

while her GIRLFRIENDS JABBER

GIRLFRIEND 1

The other girls LAUGH and COMMENT as Karen looks across the
hall at Nathan He looks lonely as he gathers his things

Karen ignores her friends’ snobby BANTER and walks towards

Nathan

INT HALLWAY NATHAN’S LOCKER -- CONTINUOUS

Nathan switches out his text books while Karen cautiously
approaches him He ignores her presence

KAREN
So wanna be my partner

NATHAN
Id rather be castrated

KAREN
Look I’m sorry okay I shouldn’t
have put it up It was funny and
now it’s not funny

NATHAN
I’m sure this is some ploy to get
me to do your homework for you

KAREN
I’m not vindictive I already feel
bad enough about this whole thing
as it is

NATHAN
I’m late for class

Nathan CLOSES his locker

KAREN

Suddenly the door bell RINGS Nathan looks out his window --
Karen is at his front door Nathan’s Halo character BLOWS up
from a bomb because of Nathan’s lack of attention

Nathan watches his mother let Karen into the house

NATHAN (CONTD)
Holy shit

He quickly grabs his clothes off the floor and shoves them
into his hamper He slides a bunch of stuff under his bed
and glances at himself in the mirror -- fixes his hair

As Karen KNOCKS outside his door he dives back into his
seat

NATHAN (CONTD)
Come in

Karen enters the room and looks around She sees the walls
lined with books movies and computer software An entire
area of the room is filled with board games chess sets and
computer games

KAREN
You like games huh

NATHAN
Not the kind of games you play

Karen SHUTS the door behind her -- walks right up to Nathan

KAREN

(stern)
Now you listen to me I screwed
up okay But I’m not going to sit
back and watch you mope and groan
and give me dirty looks for the
rest of the summer Maybe a lot of
things you said about me were true
I don’t know who I want to be just
yet But while I’m figuring that
out I’d very much like for us to
be friends And if you keep
rejecting my peaceful gestures
Ill kick the ever-loving shit out
of you Capiche

Nathan slowly nods shocked

KAREN (CONTD)
(putting out her hand)
Partners

Nathan shakes her hand
KAREN (CONTD)
Good Glad we cleared that up
Now where do we start
INT NATHAN’S BEDROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT
Nathan and Karen are doing research on their separate

laptops Karen cross-checks a fact with a book called
“America’s Missing”

KAREN
Listen to this Over twenty three
hundred Americans are reported
missing every day And even though
most of them voluntarily return
home there are still over one
hundred thousand active missing
person cases today One hundred
thousand sick

Nathan surfs through some pictures of missing people on the
web
NATHAN
What’s even more sick is some of
these sites want me to pay money to
browse their missing persons
archives

KAREN
That’s fucked up

Karen gets up to watch Nathan find a back door into the
website

NATHAN
Twenty bucks to access Montana’s
missing persons database no
wonder nobody gets found

Suddenly he breaks through their security

NATHAN (CONTD)
Bingo

A long list of names quickly scrolls across his computer
screen The information seems endless

KAREN
Whoa

NATHAN
Wow Height weight age favorite

KAREN
Well Nathan Harper you have a few
tricks up your sleeve huh

NATHAN
(browsing the pages)

Karen grabs her laptop and books and heads for the door

NATHAN (CONTD)
Listen um I’m sorry about

didn’t mean it I was just angry

KAREN

Nathan cracks a smile

KAREN (CONT’D)

Karen leaves
MOMENT LATER

Nathan looks out the window at Karen returning to her house

INT CAFETERIA -- DAY

Karen walks with her GIRLFRIENDS on the lunch line When she
pays for her meal she sees Nathan sitting by himself at one
of the tables

STUDENTS won’t go near him after his YouTube notoriety

Karen looks over at the table she usually sits at -- JOCKS
and EMO KIDS Finally

KAREN
It’s my fault he’s sitting by
himself

GIRLFRIEND 1

GIRLFRIEND 2
The psycho
NATHAN’S TABLE -- MOMENTS LATER

Karen sits down across from Nathan -- starts eating her food
like it’s no big deal

Nathan looks around at people in the cafeteria Everyones
looking at them -- some overtly and some just glancing

Nathan turns back to Karen impressed They smile at each
other as if they have an inside joke
INT NATHAN’S BEDROOM -- DUSK

Karen works at Nathan’s desktop while Nathan lies on his
bed researching some books

KAREN

Nathan smiles -- there’s a strong resemblance but not
identical
NATHAN
I guess I’m a fugitive from
justice
Karen CLICKS on the childhood photo -- a young boy three

years old white Caucasian wearing a yellow-and-blue striped
shirt

KAREN
Oh it’s definitely not you This
kid’s too cute

Nathan takes pause at the young boy’s photo He smiles along
with the joke but this boy seems eerily familiar

NATHAN
I used to have a shirt just like
that

Karen’s cell phone BEEPS

KAREN
Shit it’s my mom They’re leaving
town for a few days I get the
house to myself I gotta go see
them off You coming over later

NATHAN
Yeah I’1l be over there in an
hour cool

KAREN
Awesome

Karen runs out of the room

As Nathan closes the door he looks at the small boy pictured
on his screen It’s almost like the boy is looking back at
him He sits at his desktop and grabs the mouse -- reads
the page

The boy’s name is Steven Spade

He stares at the image for a moment before zooming in on it

SCREEN CLOSE UP The boy has a small scar on the left side
of his chin

Nathan has the identical scar on his chin -- he rubs his
finger over it

He CLICKS back to the mock-up of what the young boy would
look like now As the picture loads in Nathan sees his
reflection in the computer screen side by side with the mock-
up it’s a very close resemblance

Nathan rolls back from the computer in his chair Spooked

INT ATTIC -- MOMENTS LATER
Nathan digs through an old chest in the attic

He rummages through the old toys and school drawings as his
parents are PULLING into the driveway down below

He looks out the window at them as they get out of their car
and take some groceries from the trunk

He continues digging through the chest until he gets to some
of his old clothes

At the very bottom of the pile tucked in the deepest
darkest corner of the chest is a striped yellow and blue
shirt He slowly unfolds it -- it’s exactly like the shirt
in the picture

He hears his parents GETTING IN downstairs and rushes out of
the attic

INT NATHAN’S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Nathan hears his parents turn on the TV downstairs while he
sits at this computer trying to obtain more information

Name Steven Spade

Parents Martin and Lorna Spade

He PRINTS the picture of the boy and the mock-up

INT STAIRWELL -- MOMENTS LATER

Nathan descends the stairs quietly He peers into the
Living Room -- his parents are watching reality television

He opens the front door slowly and sneaks out

INT NATHAN’S CAR -- NIGHT

Nathan gets in his car and STARTS the engine He places the
printout of the young child on the passenger seat

A TAP at the window STARTLES him It’s his mother
He quickly turns the printout over

Mara looks at the sheet of paper and then back at Nathan

MARA
No ‘hello mom’

NATHAN
Sorry I uh was just going to go
to the library for this school
project

MARA
What’s the project
NATHAN
It’s a project on websites
Building your own website
Nathan tries to gage his mother’s reaction
Mara nods and smiles
MARA
Well don’t stay out too late
okay Love you

Mara goes to kiss Nathan on the forehead but he balks --
subtly pulls away

MARA (CONTD)
You all right

Nathan nods and backs out of the driveway

As he drives away Mara just watches him until he disappears
down the street

INT BASEMENT DEN -- DAY

In a dimly lit basement with books and computer software
lining the walls an OLDER MAN 60 TYPES on his computer

We never see his face

ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN A profile page on Nathan Harper --
including his high school picture school grades medical

reports etc

The Older Man has photos on his desk of Nathan’s parents Dr
Bennett Gilly -- everyone he has contact with

The room is filled with technical equipment tracking
software high-tech phone-tapping gadgets etc
INT PUBLIC LIBRARY -- NIGHT

Nathan scans through microfilm of New York newspapers from
the early nineties He finally reaches December 1994

- He searches ‘The Record’ -- nothing
- He searches ‘The Orange County Patriot’ -- nothing
- He searches ‘The Times Herald Record’ -- nothing

His cell phone VIBRATES It’s a text from Karen

Nathan immediately CALLS her back It RINGS for a while
before she picks up

KAREN (VO)

is me

INT KAREN’S BEDROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT

Karen sits at her laptop reading the web page while Nathan
paces around behind her

KAREN

NATHAN
You never met him Listen I don’t
know who you are or what this is
all about But you better start
answering some of my questions or
I’m jumping out of this car
Starting with who are my real
parents

BOUNTY HUNTER
Yesterday you were a normal kid
thinking about college and pussy
and all that other bullshit
Today you’re a wanted man By
tomorrow morning there’1l be an
entire country hunting you down
So you better forget about who
your parents are and start
worrying about who you are

A BEEPING HORN and bright headlights come out of nowhere
The large SUV RAMS into their truck and starts PUSHING them
across the highway They try to get out of the vehicle but
are wedged inside

EXT TRUCK HIGHWAY -- CONTINUOUS

Three MEN get out of the SUV with automatic weapons and
start SHOOTING into the water

Nathan feels his head as bullets BOUNCE off the windshield --
it must be bullet proof He looks over at the Bounty Hunter
who isn’t moving

NATHAN
(shaking him)
Hey HEY

Nathan tries to pry the Bounty Hunter from his seatbelt but
notices a large gash on the side of his head He’s dead

Bullets continue to RICOCHET off the car as the water FILLS
the vehicle

Nathan grabs the tickets and pulls the door handle -- it’s
JAMMED He struggles to open it but the door is crushed
shut He quickly climbs over the Bounty Hunter to go out
his door

EXT TRUCK -- CONTINUOUS

Nathan KICKS open the door and DIVES into the river as
bullets WHIZ past him through the water

The river flows rapidly and Nathan floats away from the
bridge quickly He sees the MEN crossing the bridge with
bright flashlights trying to spot him He puts his head
underwater and glides downstream

His tickets get lost in the water

EXT RIVER BANK -- NIGHT

Nathan washes up on a rocky shore He’s exhausted and in
pain He crawls over some rocks and finally passes out

Wesley shakes hands with Jack

WESLEY
Pleased to meet you Mr Shapiro

Jack nods while looking at the blackened structure
WESLEY (CONTD)
Now ah whatever you find in there

Jack quietly enters the house carrying his investigative
materials

A DEPUTY approaches Wesley with his CB

Nathan sleeps on the rocks as the sun rises
DREAM SEQUENCE

BLACKNESS

An echo-y rendition of ‘Que Sera Sera PLAYS way off in the
distance

The Shadowed Woman appears out of the dark Her face is just
barely in the darkness while her she holds up young Nathan
and SPINS him around

Its a joyous surreal moment as LAUGHING can be heard His
laughing -- the laughing of a small child

When her face comes into the light shes a skeleton
END OF DREAM

Nathan wakes up from the nightmare His blood is dried and
his lips are chapped He’s cold

He slowly gets up and heads into the woods

Nathan wearing dark sunglasses sift through the aisles
looking for certain survival items He grabs a backpack
electric buzzer cheap binoculars and some carving knives

MOMENTS LATER

Gilly lifts up a blanket on the back seat An assortment of
handguns are hidden underneath

NATHAN
You know how I feel about guns

GILLY
Well if you don’t turn yourself
in and there are people trying to
kill you I’m gonna have to
insist you take one of those bad
boys for protection

NATHAN

NATHAN

Karen takes out a First Aid Kit and grabs some cotton balls
and begins dabbing some of Nathan’s facial scars

Nathan nods He backs off

TRAIN HALLWAY

The Stranger BUMPS into a CAR ATTENDANT

They lean in

CAR ATTENDANT

of paper which he pick-pocketed -- a list of all the
passengers

The Stranger scans the list -- no listing for ‘Harper’

Nathan nods wiping his eyes

NATHAN
Be careful

thinks of something

NATHAN
Okay

Karen leaves

Karen is on line at the buffet She LOPS on potatoes and
green beans and chicken -- enough to feed an army

The Stranger gets on line next to her -- smiles at her

STRANGER
Hi

KAREN
Hi

STRANGER
Lot of food there You must be
hungry

Karen smiles and nods grabbing a couple of rolls She hands
her food ticket to the BUFFET LADY at the end of the long
table

The Buffet Lady looks at the amount of food on her plate

Karen not wanting to cause a scene hands over Nathan’s
ticket as well

The Stranger sees the second ticket -- he knows she’s not
alone

Karen leaves the food car

The Stranger puts down his food and follows her

SLEEPING CAR HALLWAY

Karen walks down the hallway balancing the food with her
hands

Without Karen noticing the Stranger comes up behind her
Another PASSENGER walks by passing both of them When the
Passenger is gone the Stranger puts his hand over Karens
mouth

The food FALLS to the ground -- plate SHATTERS

The Stranger PUNCHES Karen twice in the face knocking her
out He quickly keys into his room and HAULS her inside

He comes back out to clean up the mess when a STEWARD
happens to walk by

STEWARD
Oh did you drop it

STRANGER
(kindly)
Yeah sorry

STEWARD

The Stranger enters his room -- SHUTS the door

ROOM 13
The Stranger drags Karen further inside his room -- her face
bloody her body limp He leans over her takes out a gun
and jams the silencer deep in to her mouth
He checks her pockets for her room key -- finds it Room 42
STRANGER
Do you understand the importance of
telling the truth Karen
Karen barely conscious nods
STRANGER (CONTD)
Is there a secret knock or
password I should know about
before entering the room
Karen slowly shakes her head ‘no’ tears forming in her eyes

The Stranger looks deep into her eyes -- she’s lying

STRANGER (CONTD)
Such a shame

He takes out a cigar cutter with his other hand and places
her left index finger inside the cutter

He applies pressure with the cutter clamping down on her
finger but not all the way

Karen emits MUFFLED SCREAMS of agony
STRANGER (CONTD)
Is there a secret knock or
password I should know about
before entering the room
Karen slowly nods

STRANGER (CONTD)
And what is it

He takes the gun out of her mouth for her to speak
KAREN

(shortness of breath)
Two knocks

STRANGER
Two knocks then enter
Karen nods CRYING
The Stranger looks deep into her eyes -- it’s the truth
He slowly takes her finger out of the cutter -- smiles
STRANGER (CONTD)
If I go there and youve lied to
me
He SNAPS the cutter SNAP SNAP SNAP
STRANGER (CONTD)
One by one
ROOM 42
Nathan peaks through the half-open blinds watching the world
go by He looks over at Karen’s coat -- a small bottle of
PepperBall Pepper Spray sticks out of her inside pocket

Nathan smiles and picks it up

The label reads Warning Severe Irritant

He puts the bottle down and checks his watch -- it’s taking
Karen a while to come back

SLEEPING CAR HALLWAY

The Stranger enters the hallway as another FEMALE PASSENGER
walks by The Stranger smiles kindly at the Passenger but
as soon as she disappears around the corner his smile
disappears as well

He approaches Room 42 -- KNOCKS twice before KEYING into the
room

ROOM 42

The Stranger enters gun in hand -- no sign of Nathan

The Stranger quietly moves towards the bathroom and KICKS
open the door -- no Nathan

He looks up at the closed upper compartment -- aims his gun
at it He reaches for the handle slowly then PULLS it
down

No Nathan

DINING CAR

Nathan is scanning the dining car wondering where Karen
could be He doesn’t see her and heads back towards his
room

ROOM 42

When Nathan reaches his room he gets out his keys to open
the door but notices something odd next to the doorknob

Blood Just a small speck of blood above the doorknob
He HEARS someone in the room and quickly steps to the side
The Stranger exits the room looking in the other direction

Nathan quickly sneaks inside the room and SHUTS the door
but the Stranger CATCHES it before it’s completely closed
Nathan PUNCHES his fingers and tries to JAM them by SLAMMING
closed the door

But the Stranger is stronger than Nathan and PUSHES back
open the door GRABBING Nathan by the neck

They struggle against each other until Nathan momentarily
gets the upper hand He holds his arm around the Strangers
neck as tight as he can

The Stranger arms wailing around SHOOTS his gun three
times BLASTING the window into pieces

The WIND BLOWS hard from outside as the Stranger manages to
get free from Nathan’s grip and grabs Nathan’s neck in
return Their STRUGGLE reaches the newly destroyed window
as the Stranger leans Nathan onto shards of glass while
grasping his neck

The Stranger takes out a tranquilizer gun and presses it
against Nathan’s neck

But Nathan grabs Karen’s Pepper Spray and SQUIRTS it in the
Stranger’s face

As the Stranger GROANS in pain Nathan grabs his tranquilizer
gun and INJECTS it twice into the Stranger’s adam’s apple
causing his eyes to BUG OUT in agony

Nathan holds the gun on his neck as the Stranger eventually
collapses on top of him

Nathan rolls the Stranger off of him and quickly checks his
pockets -- Ukrainian passport Russian memos and photographs
of Nathan from newspaper clippings He takes all of it

He looks for the Stranger’s key -- finds it -- room 13

As Nathan lifts the Stranger up he wakes up He starts
GRABBING for Nathan’s neck again YELLING something in
UKRAINIAN

Nathan flops him on to the ledge of the window -- pushing him
off the train He watches the Stranger land on the parallel
tracks SNAPPING his neck

But he also sees a YOUNG BOY in the next car leaning out

the window witnessing the whole thing The boy looks
directly at Nathan -- oops

SLEEPING CAR HALLWAY

Nathan exits his room with his backpack and Karen’s things
On his way down the hallway the train comes to a SCREECHING
HALT

Nathan falls backwards along with a couple other PASSENGERS
but quickly gets up and runs down the hallway

NEXT CAR
Nathan reaches Room 13 and gets out the Stranger’s key

Sounds of COMMOTION can be heard in the distance as people
are realizing that a man was thrown off the train

ROOM 13

Nathan enters Room 13 and sees Karen beaten bloodied
passed out and tied to the radiator

Worried for her life Nathan leans over her and checks her
pulse

NATHAN
(whispers )
Karen Karen
She’s conscious but very weak

NATHAN (CONTD)
Say something

KAREN
(barely audible)
Something
Nathan helps her up

NATHAN
Stay with me Stay with me

The train comes to a final JOLT as the TRAIN WORKERS
investigate the situation somewhere outside
Nathan is on borrowed time -- he needs to think fast

NATHAN (CONTD)
Can you walk if I help you

Karen nods

IN BETWEEN CARS

Nathan pulls the ‘emergency’ latch on the exit door and gets
off the train holding Karen as a crutch

The ALARM RINGS

EXT TRAIN -- CONTINUOUS

Nathan helps Karen off the train He sees WORKERS and
CONDUCTORS way off in the distance at the end of the train
surrounding the Stranger’s body

He ducks into the woods with Karen before anyone can see
them

INT NATHAN’S HOUSE -- DAY

Jack Shapiro and his partner MARCUS LANG 30s Nigerian
tall and slender quietly chip away at evidence within the

house

Marcus removes a piece of molding on the ceiling as Jack
gets up on a step ladder to review what’s behind it

Jack reaches inside and grabs a tiny plastic ball with
wires attached to it He dusts off some ash revealing a
tiny glass lens on one side

Jack and Marcus look at each other in confirmation

INT WESLEY’S OFFICE -- DAY

Wesley Jack Marcus and Fletcher are present All are
seated

Jack lights up a cigarette admiring a knitted quilt hanging
on Wesley’s wall

JACK
Love the quilt
WESLEY
Thank you My wife made it

Marcus dumps five of the plastic balls on the desk

WESLEY (CONTD)
What the hell are these

JACK
Pinhole cameras Found them in
five different rooms of the house
including Nathan Harper’s bedroom

Wesley picks one up and examines it

Marcus dumps more objects on the desk as they discuss

WESLEY
Well what the hell does that mean
Voyeurism

JACK
They look like surveillance
cameras monitored from a remote
location not within the house
The snipped wires suggest
communication was cut off some time
ago Whether his parents knew
about them or not is anyone’s
guess

Wesley turns his attention to another pile of wires
gadgetry

WESLEY
And this

JACK
RDX plastic explosive The
Russians used these to blow out
foxholes in Afghanistan in the
80’s This is the skunk that wiped
out the house and you can’t find
it at the local candy store

Wesley points at a melted gun next to the bomb

JACK (CONTD)
That’s a Stetchkin APS pistol
Also made in Russia Ukraine
specifically Custom made to fit an
M4 silencer Again these toys
cannot be bought in America

WESLEY
Youre saying

and

JACK
I’m saying when Forensics checks
the unidentified victim’s teeth
it’s possible they won’t find a
match in the United States My
recommendation for what it’s
worth is to contact the FBI

WESLEY
Let’s see what Forensics says
Until then I’d appreciate it if we
kept this information in this room

Jack and Marcus get up to leave

JACK
Not a problem But think of it
this way If this kid has even a
shred of innocence then you’d
better find him before the
Russians do

WESLEY
We’ve got over seventy men out
there looking for him

Jack opens the door to exit One last thought
JACK
Personally Id be most worried
about the cameras

WESLEY
Why’s that

JACK
Because there’s always someone
behind them Someone who knows
more than you

that’s what’s important We’re
going to figure this thing out

Nathan nods not believing her Finally

NATHAN
There are two men outside waiting
for us

KAREN

Are you sure

Nathan nods as Karen gets up and tries the window It
BUDGES a little

KAREN (CONT’D)
Then we have to get out of here

NATHAN
(sarcastic)
Maybe we should walk up to them and
ask them what they want

Karen opens the window all the way

KAREN
Not an option

NATHAN
What if there is no Paul Rasmus
And even if there is what’s he
going to do for me I’m a dead
man

KAREN
Nathan if you lose it then I’m
going to lose it
Karen grabs Nathan and forces him up
KAREN (CONTD)

walkie-talkies landlines foreign devices etc

NATHAN
Home She won’t be safe there

Maybe you didn’t get the memo but
there are people trying to kill us
BOYER
Were not so sure they’re trying to
kill you
NATHAN
(amused)
Really Because I’ve been shot at

stabbed bombed and nearly
strangled to death in the past
twenty four hours I don’t think
these people are trying to be my
friends

BOYER
Yet you’re still alive

Boyer tosses a folder in front of Nathan

NATHAN
What’s this

BOYER
It’s a comprehensive list of every
enemy you have dead or alive

Nathan opens the folder revealing photographs of Alek Nevin
Gregory Hill the Stranger Victor Kozlow and other files of
people Nathan’s never seen before It contains their
aliases height weight age affiliations and last known
points and places of interest

NATHAN
This is a joke right I don’t
even know these people

BOYER
But they know you And more
importantly they know your father
Nathan looks up from the folder

NATHAN
My father

The Van STOPS The back doors open revealing a runway of a
private airport

EXT PRIVATE AIRPORT -- CONTINUOUS

Boyer Nathan and a dozen AGENTS walk across a long runway
to get to a large private plane

BOYER
Your father is a Black Ops agent
named Martin Spade Nicknamed ‘the
Locust’ He’s a deep clandestine
operative who’s been working in
the field for over twenty five
years Because of the nature of
his work he has a long list of
enemies

NATHAN
So now they’re my enemies

BOYER
No one at the CIA even knows what
he looks like any more except for
me If any of the people in that
folder get a hold of you they
could use you to lure Martin out
And if they lure him out it could
put the United States at risk You
are clearly worth more alive then
dead

NATHAN
Well that’s a relief I feel so
much more comfortable now

BOYER
You should under our protective
custody

NATHAN

Where was your protective custody
when my house blew up

BOYER
Surveillance was pulled three years
ago at your parents request

NATHAN
Why

BOYER
Because they wanted you to live a
normal life

(MORE )

BOYER (CONTD)
I agreed to pull the plug as long
as a third party kept a watchful
eye over you That was Dr
Barrett

Boyer stops at the steps leading to the plane -- looks at
Nathan

BOYER (CONT’D)
They loved you Nathan They took
the opportunity to bring you up
and seized it with everything they
had to offer I’m truly sorry
that all this has happened But
were going to get through this
thing all right I need you to
trust me

NATHAN
Trust needs to be earned You’re
not anywhere near that

INT WESTERN UNION -- EARLY EVENING

Wesley is at the cash window waiting for the female EMPLOYEE
to find him on her computer Finally

EMPLOYEE

dollar fee sir

WESLEY
(smiles )

EXT WESTERN UNION -- MOMENTS LATER

Wesley gets on a pay phone and DIALS a number he has written
on a piece of paper A STRANGE VOICE answers

STRANGE VOICE

Yes

WESLEY
Hey I ah received your kind
donation

No response Awkward silence

WESLEY (CONT’D)

information they give me if you
want—

STRANGE VOICE
We won’t be needing you any more

CLICK

CUT TO

INT HOUSE -- SIMULTANEOUS

The MAN with the strange voice hangs up the cell phone
It’s Victor Kozlow He’s fifteen years older from when we
last saw him (at the beginning of the script) He’s sitting
on a couch looking out a bay window

He places the cell phone inside a leather case with twenty
other cell phones -- ZIPS it up He picks up a pair of
binoculars and looks out the window

KOZLOW’S POV Nathan’s burnt down house

Just as we realize Kozlow’s location we see a DEAD NEIGHBOR
lying on the carpet His throat’s been slit

Becker (also fifteen years older) stands over the Dead Man
wiping the blood off his knife
INT PRIVATE PLANE -- NIGHT

Frank Boyer and TOM SHEALY 50’s sit across from Nathan at
the back of the plane Tom is another agent

BOYER
Nathan this is Tom Shealy He’ll
be helping us over the next few
hours

SHEALY
Hello Nathan

Tom Shealy extends his hand but Nathan ignores it He keeps
his sights on Boyer

NATHAN
Helping us with what

Boyer nods for Tom to explain

SHEALY
When you were three years old a
former Ukrainian KGB Operative
named Victor Kozlow tracked down
and killed one of our agents
During the siege he found a folder
containing sensitive information
about Martin’s life including
pictures of you and the fact that
you existed

Shealy hands Nathan the file on Kozlow along with the
photograph of Nathan from when he was younger

NATHAN
And where was my mother during all
this

BOYER

Your mother was the agent that
Kozlow killed I’m sorry

Boyer hands Nathan a photograph of his real mother (The
woman from the beginning of the script) She’s smiling
holding a young Nathan in her arms

BOYER (CONT’D)
Her name was Lorna Gibbons

Nathan is immediately affected by the image Things start
coming back to him

FLASH

The woman in Nathans dreams comes out of the shadows it’s
the woman in this picture She finally has a face

BACK TO
Boyer

BOYER (CONT’D)
Sometimes photos of you would
appear on the web We take them
down track them Dead end

NATHAN
So why don’t you guys go out there
and get this asshole

Boyer and Shealy look at each other

SHEALY
Because he disappeared a few years
ago He was the top assassin in
the Ukraine with an allied Soviet
network Untouchable

(MORE )

SHEALY (CONTD)
On CIA’s most wanted list Then
one day poof gone
Disappeared

BOYER
An apparent retirement

SHEALY
Of which he’s been brought out of
Our Special Activities Division is
up in arms about it to say the
least

Nathan looks back at the picture of his mother

NATHAN
I want to meet my father
BOYER
(to Shealy)

Tom can we have a minute
Tom obliges -- walks up front

BOYER (CONTD)
I’m afraid that’s impossible

NATHAN
Why

BOYER
The reason you were hidden away in
the first place was to protect your
father from being compromised by
any threats on his loved ones He
has no friends no family and
therefore no distractions

NATHAN
But he does have a family He has
a son

BOYER

Not that he knows of
Nathan is stunned

NATHAN
What are you talking about

BOYER
The day you were born your father
was half way across the world He
was completely unaware of your
mother’s pregnancy

NATHAN
That’s impossible I met a man who
said he was hired by my father to
find me

This is news to Boyer

BOYER
Who What man What was his name

NATHAN
He didn’t tell me his name

BOYER
Well what did he look like When
was this

Nathan stands up angry

NATHAN
You gave me away to strangers

BOYER
Tell me who this man was

NATHAN
You pulled the surveillance Left
me for dead

Boyer stands up too

BOYER

I gave you a name and a life And
when your mother died I appointed
you a new set of parents a new
home and an unblemished existence
I know every grade you ever
received every girl you ever
kissed and every nightmare that
haunts you in your sleep

(beat)
I know everything there is to know
about you Nathan so please give
me the courtesy of sitting back
down while we sort this situation
out

Nathan sits back down

INT HOUSE -- NIGHT

Kozlow and Becker sit in the same house as before in the
dark They sit in silence

Finally a car PULLS up across the street It parks in the
driveway next to Nathan’s house -- Karen’s house

Two CIA AGENTS get out of the car followed by Karen
Kozlow and Becker look at each other This is who they’ve
been waiting for

EXT AIRFIELD -- LATER THAT NIGHT

The private plane LANDS on an airstrip

INT PRIVATE PLANE -- NIGHT

While Boyer isn’t paying attention Nathan looks through some
of the notes that he found on the Stranger Most of them are
written in Ukrainian Some key words are in English

As he scans through some of the notes one passage pops out
at him

An American phone number is listed

Nathan looks over at a bulky aircraft phone right next to the
bathroom He looks over at Boyer who is on his laptop

NATHAN
I’m going to the bathroom

Boyer nods barely paying attention

Nathan gets up to use the bathroom but picks up the aircraft
phone instead DIALS the Stranger’s listed number

Once the phone starts RINGING he hears another cell phone
RINGING at the front of the plane

Its Tom Shealys cell phone
Shealy picks up

SHEALY
Hello

Shealy’s voice ECHOES inside Nathan’s phone

SHEALY (CONTD)
Hello Hello

Nathan looks up at Tom Shealy He turns pale -- HANGS up the
phone quickly He thinks for a second

Finally he picks the phone back up and stretches its cord
across the aisle hooking it into the back leg of a seat

Boyer looks at his watch -- looks out the window at the
runway

He checks to see if Nathan is back in his seat -- not yet
Suddenly he hears the ALARM go off at the back of the plane
Boyer gets up and runs to the back but trips over the phone
cord on his way Agent 1 follows Boyer to the back door to

see what’s going on

BOYER’S POV The Emergency Exit has been opened with the
raft laid out

Nathan is gone

EXT PRIVATE AIRPORT RUNWAY -- DAWN

Nathan runs for his life across the runway as the sun rises
The nearest building in the small barren airport is a one-
story Control Tower He sees a Control Tower in the
distance and heads for it

INT PRIVATE AIRPLANE -- SIMULTANEOUS

Boyer gets out his cell

BOYER
He’s escaped

But as soon as Boyer turns around he realizes Tom Shealy is
holding a gun on him Boyer is shocked

BOYER (CONTD)
What is this

TOM SHEALY
It’s nothing personal Frank All
Kozlow wants is the kid He has no
intention of harming anyone
AGENT 1 comes from behind Boyer and handcuffs him

BOYER
Why Tom Why

TOM SHEALY
You know why Frank
INT CONTROL TOWER -- SIMULTANEOUS
As soon as Nathan enters the tower he sees two AIR TRAFFIC
CONTROLLERS standing inside When they turn around he

realizes they’re not Air Traffic Controllers at all

It’s Victor Kozlow and his partner Becker

KOZLOW
Hello young man

With nowhere to run Nathan slowly walks backwards out of the
Tower back on to the runway

KOZLOW (CONTD)
There’s nowhere to go my friend
EXT RUNWAY -- CONTINUOUS

Nathan sees Boyer being held by Agent 1 and Tom Shealy
waiting for him outside

Nathan is trapped as Becker comes from behind him and puts
a strangle hold on him

Kozlow slowly exits the Tower and takes a good look at
Boyer

KOZLOW
You’re not aging well Frank Been
under some stress

Boyer looks at Shealy in disbelief Then to Kozlow
BOYER
Take me for god’s sake I’m
Martin’s only contact
Kozlow LAUGHS
KOZLOW
It runs a lot deeper than that
Frank Doesn’t it
Nathan tries to get free but Becker tightens his hold
KOZLOW (CONTD)

Tell Nathan the truth about
Martin Spade

BOYER
He’s an emissary for the United
States of-

KOZLOW

He broke the fourth Geneva
convention Frank Killed
civilians women children

BOYER
It was an accident and you know
it

KOZLOW
Tell Nathan the name of the child
Martin murdered years ago

BOYER
I was an accident-

KOZLOW
Tell him the name of the child

Agent 1 pushes the gun up against Boyer’s neck Finally

BOYER

Kozlow Peter Kozlow
KOZLOW

My son On his eleventh

birthday

Nathan realizes the kind of danger he’s in But he’s
helpless

TOM SHEALY

(to Boyer)

(softly)
How many people have to die for us
to save this one kid Frank All
we have to do is give him the kid
and he goes away It’s for the
best

BOYER
All those years Tom All those
years we were friends

TOM SHEALY
It’s just a simple trade Frank
No more no less

Tom places a chloroform rag in Boyer’s mouth causing him to
be sedated

Becker injects a syringe into Nathan’s neck causing him to
pass out as well

BLACKOUT

INT ROOM 231 -- DAY

Nathan slowly wakes up tied to a chair inside a hotel room
He has a rag in his mouth causing him to BREATHE loudly
through his nose He drearily looks around and sees that
Victor Kozlow is sitting across from him and Karen is tied
up in a chair next to him -- rag in mouth as well

Kozlow motions for Becker to take the rag out of Nathan’s
mouth
Nathan stares at Kozlow intently while Becker takes it out

Kozlow smiles

KOZLOW
At last we meet
NATHAN
Why is she here
KOZLOW
Because she means something to you
NATHAN
Let her go I don’t care what you
do to me just let her go
KOZLOW
Thank you for further proving my

point

Nathan looks around the room He sees the Canadian National
Tower (CN Tower) outside the large window It’s a beautiful
structure with a big gorgeous blue sky surrounding it

Something about this room is familiar

KOZLOW (CONTD)
Astonishing view isn’t it I
thought it would be serendipitous
to bring you here before we take
you back to Odessa

NATHAN
I don’t get it

KOZLOW
This is the room where your mother
took her last breath

Nathan immediately knows he’s right His anger begins to
swell inside him

NATHAN
You killed her

KOZLOW
That’s not true Nathan I had no
intention of killing your mother

NATHAN
Bullshit

KOZLOW
Well you should know better than
anyone you were in the room when

it happened

Nathan takes pause

NATHAN
What are you talking about

KOZLOW
You don’t remember do you

QUICK FLASHBACK

- The CN Tower

- The Suitcase on the bed
BACK TO

Kozlow

KOZLOW (CONTD)

It’s a funny thing the human mind
I’ve outsmarted some of the world’s
finest leaders Covered my tracks
meticulously systematically and
with great caution over the years
I take great pride in my attention
to detail But in this hotel room
I made one tiny colossal
mistake

(beat)
I forgot to check under the bed

NATHAN
(thinking)
The bed

QUICK FLASHBACK

Nathans mother Lorna years earlier is GASPING for air
while Kozlow kneels over her

KOZLOW (0S)
-What youre feeling right now
is your nervous system
deteriorating If you answer my
question correctly you can keep
the mask If not I will keep the
mask Do you understand

As Nathans mother nods we see

NATHAN three years old hiding under the bed GASPING for
air witnessing the whole thing

Kozlow places the mask back on Lorna

KOZLOW (0S) (CONTD)
Now Ill ask you one more time

WOMAN
And in that one time youll get
the same answer
Lorna RIPS the mask off and tosses it under the bed
--to young Nathan who immediately puts it on
BACK TO
Kozlow
KOZLOW
I’m not a monster Nathan It’s
not my style to kill a lowly CIA
analyst But she sacrificed her
life so that you could live
yours
QUICK FLASHBACK

Nathan under the bed with the mask on watches his mother
take her last breath Hes terrified

He watches Kozlow and Beckers feet as they exit the room
The sirens from below get LOUDER He looks at his mother
shes gone
BACK TO
Kozlow
KOZLOW (CONTD)
I left the room with a gray folder
when I could’ve had the crown
jewel
Kozlow throws up his arms
KOZLOW (CONTD)

C’est la vie Better late than
never

EXT CN TOWER STEEPLE -- SIMULTANEOUS

Amidst the big beautiful sky we see the end of a sniper
rifle peek out behind the tip of the Tower

SCOPE POV The hotel room -- with Nathan Karen Kozlow
Becker Tom Shealy and Agent 1 1500 yards away

Kozlow is obscured by Nathan and Karen

INT ROOM 231 -- SIMULTANEOUS
Kozlow adjusts his seat to be closer to Nathan

KOZLOW
Martin at his core is an evil
soul Nathan He has no moral
code Well I’m going to take a
page from his notebook I’m going
to let it be known that I have
Martin Spade’s son And when he
comes to get you which I know he
will he’s going to find you cut
up in to a thousand pieces
starting with your ears

Kozlow touches Nathan’s ear
Nathan pulls away

KOZLOW (CONTD)
Then your eyes

Suddenly three bullets PEARCE through the window HITTING
Agent 1 in the head and chest He drops to the floor
instantaneously

Everyone else spreads in different directions -- hiding
behind walls Kozlow Becker and Tom Shealy get out their
guns

Silence as a pool of blood develops under Agent 1’s head

Nathan and Karen are right in the middle of the room in full
view Karen is CRYING

Everyone looks out the window to see where the bullets came
from

As Tom peeks out from behind the wall he gets SHOT through
his right eye Blood SPLATTERS as he drops to the ground
with a THUD

KOZLOW (CONTD)
(in Ukrainian)
Where is he

Becker takes a small mirror to get a look out the window
The reflection shows a MAN IN BLACK way off in the distance
on the top of the CN Tower

The mirror gets SHOT and SHATTERS into a hundred fragments

Nathan sees Karen crying -- tries to pull free from the rope
It dawns on him

NATHAN
(whispers )
Were out in the open but he’s
not shooting at us

Karen nods in confirmation
Becker loads a semi-automatic
KOZLOW
(in Ukrainian)
He’s on the top of the CN Tower
yes
Becker nods
NATHAN
(under his breath)
CN Tower

Suddenly two bullets PEARCE though the rope that ties Nathan
to the chair Two more PEARCE through Karen’s rope

Before Kozlow realizes they’re free

NATHAN (CONTD)

(to Karen)
RUN

Nathan and Karen run out the door as Kozlow SHOOTS at them
Becker takes his semi-automatic and aims it at the ceiling
He FIRES off a round causing the ceiling to obstruct the
SNIPER’S view and the SPRINKLERS and ALARM to go off
INT HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS
Nathan and Karen run down the hallway as Becker exits the
room chasing them SHOOTING
EXT HOTEL ROOM -- MOMENT LATER

Nathan and Karen run out of the lobby into the streets
toward the CN Tower

Becker chases them through the streets SHOOTING his guns
causing cars to CRASH and people to SCREAM and hide in every
direction

INT CN TOWER LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS

Nathan and Karen enter the CN Tower lobby -- Nathan JAMS a
chair inside the revolving door

SECURITY GUARD
Hey Hold it right there-

The glass gets SHOT out by Becker causing TOURISTS to run
and SCREAM and scatter in every direction BAM BAM BAM

Nathan and Karen run to one of the elevators as SECURITY
GUARDS get wiped out one by one by Becker

Nathan JABS away at the elevator buttons hoping the doors
will close before Becker gets to them

Becker runs towards the elevator SHOOTING at the back wall
Finally when the doors slowly close Becker’s hand reaches
in between the doors

Karen takes the emergency phone and HAMMERS at his fingers
until he lets go -- the doors close

INT ELEVATOR -- CONTINUOUS

The elevator has a glass floor panel As the elevator rises
Becker SHOOTS out the glass causing Nathan and Karen to have
to cling tight to the side wall

“What a Difference a Day Makes” plays over the elevator
speakers as Karen and Nathan wait to get to the top

NATHAN
(calmly)
Youve got to get everyone into the
stairwell

Karen nods Finally

KAREN
Is that the best you’ve got

NATHAN
(beat)
Yup
INT SPACE DECK -- CONTINUOUS
BING
The elevator doors open to the higher Sky Pod an observation

deck over 1400 feet above the ground The view is
breathtaking -- overseeing 70 miles of land city and ocean

TOURISTS are everywhere and Becker is most assuredly on the
next elevator to arrive

Nathan runs to a TICKET TAKER

NATHAN
Youve got to stop the elevator

TICKET TAKER
Okay just calm down-

NATHAN
Youve got to stop the elevator

Karen runs to random PEOPLE URGING them to get off the deck
immediately

Two GUARDS notice Nathan and Karen causing panic

GUARD 1
Hey Where are your tickets

NATHAN
There’s no time Everyone has to
evacuate the deck
Guard 2 takes out a tazer and aims it at Nathan
GUARD 2
I’m going to ask you to step back
sir
The next elevator arrives
DING
Nathan gets behind the Guard

The elevator opens revealing Becker with his Semi-automatic
He starts SHOOTING up the place -- beginning with the Guards

Nathan shields himself with the Guard as TOURISTS and
PATRONS SCREAM and run for their lives

Becker has gone completely mad BLOWING out half the windows
as people duck for cover A harsh WIND comes in from the
outside SUCKING some people over the ledge

Nathan pulls the gun from the dead Guard’s holster but
Becker runs at him strong

Nathan starts running towards the ledge as Becker SHOOTS at
him Nathan slips and falls over the edge catching the
floor railing His gun slides over to Karen

Nathan dangles off the side of the Space Deck watching
another FEMALE TOURIST lose her grasp and fall to her death

The plunge to death is so far below that her SCREAMS fade
into silence

Nathan tries to maintain a grip as Becker slowly walks to
the edge and stands over him

Becker slowly GRINDS his shoe into Nathan’s right hand
causing it to let go He starts grinding on Nathan’s other
hand

Nathan winces in agony as he prepares to let go and fall
1400 feet

Suddenly two SHOTS hit Becker in the back He slowly
falls towards Nathan passing over him and plunging to his
death

NATHAN’S POV A hand with a black glove extends over the
ledge

Nathan grabs the hand as the SNIPER dressed head to toe in
black helps him up to safety

When Nathan fully stands up he looks eye-to-eye at the
Sniper whose face is obscured by a black mask

Is this his father

They look at each other for a moment before the Sniper opens
his mouth to say something

SNIPER
December 18th 1994 Your mother
was going to meet me here at the
tower to introduce me to you
Long pause Finally

SNIPER (CONTD)
But she never showed up

Suddenly the Sniper gets SHOT in the side of his neck And
then SHOT in the ribs causing him to fall off the ledge

NATHAN
NOOOOOO

The Sniper barely CATCHES the floor railing He dangles off
the ledge wounded

Kozlow holding the smoking gun takes aim at Nathan

But Kozlow gets SHOT in the chest before he can pull off
another shot

REVEAL Karen holding the Guard’s gun trembling

Nathan grabs another gun off the floor and SHOOTS Kozlow
multiple times making sure he’s dead for good

Kozlow drops his gun and falls to the ground COUGHING up
blood

As Nathan gets closer to him he realizes Kozlow has a bullet-
proof jacket on He’s alive but in bad shape

Nathan holds his sights on Kozlow

KOZLOW
Do it aim the gun at my head and
pull the trigger Do what father
knows best

Karen walks to the ledge where the Sniper fell
Nathan looks at her -- she shakes her head ‘he’s gone’
KOZLOW (CONTD)
Now the CIA is your father

New life new name new home
(looks at Karen)

New girl You’1ll be owned by
them forever
Nathan takes aim at Kozlow’s head -- the anger swelling

inside him

KOZLOW (CONTD)
(coughs more blood)

Please Nathan put me out of my
misery Let me be with my
son

Nathan takes pause This statement has a profound impact on
him He begins lowering his weapon He looks at the
elevators -- two of them will arrive in less than a minute

Nathan grabs a Guards’ handcuffs and puts them on Kozlow

KAREN
What are you doing

NATHAN
I need to be on my own

KAREN
What do you mean

Nathan finishes putting on the handcuffs
NATHAN

He’s right I need to find myself
before they define who I am

KAREN
But you don’t have any money any-

NATHAN
I’ll get by Find my way

The elevators are about to open

NATHAN (CONTD)
I just want you to know that

They look at each other as Nathan tries to find the words
Finally Karen KISSES him -- a sweet kiss cut off short by

DING

The elevator opens and numerous TORONTO POLICE OFFICERS and
OFFICIALS storm out on to the deck

But only Karen is in their sights when they arrive
TORONTO POLICE
(to Karen)

Put your hands up

The POLICE gather other TOURISTS and VICTIMS who were taking
cover

- They arrest Kozlow

- They escort Karen off the floor

EXT CN TOWER -- MOMENTS LATER

SLOW MOTION As the TOURISTS and PATRONS are led out of the
building

Nathan is among them blending right in hanging his head
low so as not to be noticed amidst the chaos When he gets
out in a courtyard to safety he looks up at the tall tower
One last look and then disappears into an alleyway

INT CIA HEADQUARTERS CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

This just came in for you

Wesley opens the note as Fletcher leaves

It reads Love the quilt Isn’t it a little crooked

esley looks up at his wife’s quilt hanging up on the wall
ts definitely a little off kilter

He

He gets up and walks over to it But just before he adjusts
it he notices a tiny hole punctured in the middle He takes
the quilt off the wall to see what’s behind it

It’s a small spy camera looking right at him

Wesley grabs the camera and immediately RIPS it off the
attached wires

EXT DEPUTY’S OFFICE -- LATER

No response

Wesley nods for a DEPUTY to slide a key card to unlock the
door Once the door UNLOCKS they BARGE into the room with
their weapons out but no one is inside

They see multiple running television monitors with
surveillance video -- every room of the Precinct was being
watched

There is wiretap equipment placed on the bed with memo notes
attached reading Upstairs bedroom kitchen Living room

Wesley looks closer at one of the surveillance monitors

WESLEY (CONTD)

Fletcher realizes the memo notes are for Wesley

FLETCHER

Wesley starts to realize he’s in a world of shit

A DVD Player rests on a table top A small memo note reads
Play me

Wesley presses PLAY

Footage appears on the screen of Jack Shapiro when he was in
Wesleys office the day before It starts from when Jack and
Marcus are on their way out the door

JACK
(on TV)
Personally Id be most worried
about the cameras

WESLEY
(on TV)
Why’s that
JACK
(on TV)
Because there’s always someone
behind them Someone who knows

more than you
The screen goes to black

Wesley GULPS as Fletcher receives a note from a fellow
OFFICER

FLETCHER
Sir the Marshal’s office claims
they never heard of a ‘Jack

Suddenly a gun is aimed at Wesley Three FBI AGENTS are
in the room

Boyer stares at the red phone It RINGS again He slowly
closes his cell phone and walks over to the red phone

Picks it up

CUT TO

INT NICE BATHROOM -- NIGHT
Jack Shapiro on a headset with his shirt off is calml
stitching up a wound in his neck -- the wound he got saving
Nathan’s life
Hes Martin Spade
INTERCUT BoyerMartin conversation

MARTIN

I found him Frank You did a good
job hiding him But I found him

BOYER
He’s umm perfectly safe now
Martin

MARTIN

That’s not what I hear

BOYER
Youre supposed to be off the grid
right now The fact that you’re
making this call tells me your
letting personal feelings
compromise the job at hand

MARTIN
I’m in the field where I belong
And youre sitting behind a desk
where you belong

Martin puts on a tuxedo shirt and starts buttoning it up He
hides his stitches with the shirt collar

BOYER
Still the nature of this call
puts into question your ability to
perform your job If I find out
that you make contact with Nathan
again I’1ll be forced to recommend
pulling you out of the field
indefinitely

MARTIN
Save the empty threats Frank

BOYER
They’re the only threats I’ve got

MARTIN
Fair enough I promise to hold up
my end of the bargain as long as
you hold up yours

BOYER
Well do everything in our power to
find him and protect him Martin
You have my word

Martin puts on a bow tie

MARTIN
Good Because if I find out his
life’s in danger again Or if
anything should happen to him You
wont be sitting behind a desk
anymore Frank You’1l be lying in
an open casket

Martin HANGS up
STAY WITH MARTIN
Martin adjusts his bow tie and puts on a sharp tuxedo

jacket He grabs a tiny handgun off the sink and places it
in his inside pocket

He exits the bathroom into

INT LARGE BALLROOM -- NIGHT

Sweeping MUSIC fills the air It’s the “BLUE DENUBE WALTZ”
by Strauss

Hundreds of GUESTS in tuxedos and evening gowns are dancing
CHATTING eating and drinking

A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN approaches Martin She reaches her hand
out for a dance

BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
Are you ready darling

MARTIN
Of course my dear

They immediately sweep into the dance floor dancing to the
MUSIC Martin is an excellent dancer and he has this woman
in the palm of his hand

EXT LONE CABIN -- LATE AFTERNOON

An open desert landscape with WIND blowing hard in all
directions

As tumbleweeds FLOAT by an old run down cabin stands
alone The chimes on the porch JINGLE in the wind Old

Buddha sculptures and African art decorate the cabin The
outside walls are filled with Aboriginal face masks and
Indian feathers

Nathan stands a few yards from the cabin looking at it

FADE IN TITLE CARD FIFTEEN MILES OUTSIDE MODESTO

EXT PORCH -- MOMENTS LATER

Nathan approaches the front door and KNOCKS

After a moment a MAN opens the door

Its Marcus Lang (Jack Shapiros arson partner from earlier)
He looks at Nathan for a moment but doesn’t speak

Finally

NATHAN
Are you Paul Rasmus

Marcus nods

NATHAN (CONTD)
Do you know who I am

RASMUS
(British accent)
No

NATHAN
You were supposed to meet me a
couple day ago On an overnight
train from Virginia

RASMUS
I’m sorry I think you have me
mixed up with someone else

Rasmus tries to shut the door
Nathan holds it open

NATHAN
Well is there another Paul Rasmus
in Modesto It’s important

RASMUS
I really couldn’t tell you I
don’t know

Nathan looks defeated -- out of options

NATHAN
I’m looking for information
about my father If you know
anything-

RASMUS
I’m sorry I wish I could help

Rasmus tries shutting the door again
Nathan holds it open again
NATHAN
(desperate)
Please
As Nathan holds the door he sees Rasmus’s WIFE and three
CHILDREN inside sitting at the dinner table They look back
at him wondering what’s going on

Nathan has clearly interrupted a family supper He feels bad
-- lets go of the door

NATHAN (CONTD)
I’m sorry to have bothered you

Nathan walks away towards the road

INT RASMUS’S KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER
Rasmus sits down at the table to continue eating his dinner

WIFE
Who was that hun

RASMUS
Someone with the wrong address

Rasmus’s wife nods and starts making funny faces at their
SON 6 who returns the gesture They’re the cutest family
in the world

CLOSE ON Rasmus looking at his beautiful family --
conflicted

EXT BUS STOP -- DUSK

Nathan waits by himself at a lonely bus stop in the middle
of the desert The wind still BLOWS heavily as Nathan

watches the sun go down Where to go from here

He takes out the picture of his mother that Boyer gave him
He feels more lost and lonely than ever

In the distance an old Volkswagon beetle comes into view
driving towards the Stop The beetle PULLS up in front of
Nathan

It’s Rasmus He doesn’t look at Nathan -- looks straight
ahead thinking The ENGINE stays on

Nathan gets up and approaches the passenger side window
After a long moment Rasmus turns and looks at him

RASMUS
Get in

BLACKOUT

THE END
