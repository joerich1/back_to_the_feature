EXT SUBURBAN STREET “THE CLIFF” COMMUNITY - DAY

A street like any other in outer soon to be over-developed suburbia Where
mixed use community developments pop up endlessly each further away than
the last and that include their Central Workplace in the center of the
neighborhood community around it The entire grounds are gated in It’s a new
way of living yet oddly familiar Mailboxes in front of both humble McHouses
and fancier McMansions Dogs barking in yards cars people on the sidewalk
and frozen apple pie

TOE JACKSON

(voice-over)
Welcome to THE CLIFF What developers call
“The Future of Yesterday” Which is today Or
tomorrow too Anyway it’s where live It’s
your ordinary mixed use community guess
dogs cars people neighborhoods All
surrounding BLACK BOX INDUSTRIES
INCORPORATED or “Black Inc” for short
They’re the guys that make the Black Box
thingy that’s been sweeping the nation for the
past decade

We see a giant BUILDING in the Black Box shape Like the Glass Apple Store
in New York City only this is the size of four square blocks It sits in the middle
of the community looming large over the neighborhoods around it

INFOMERCIAL MONTAGE INSERT for the BLACK BOX

GOOFY HOST
I’ve got a garage full of gadgets Oscar Why
do need this one What does it do

BRITISH HOST
No Mike The question is “What DOESNT it
do”

Rapid-fire images accompany the laundry list of features on the Black Box The
device itself is a well its a black box of varying sizes depending on the
model It’s like a Rubik’s Cube in that it can be reconfigured into different
elegant but angular shapes to conform to it’s current use

BRITISH HOST (CONT’D)
Its a multimedia player A can opener A dog
groomer A hair restorer Its a shredder A
humidifer Its a “clapper” A PDA

BRITISH HOST (CONTD)
It calls the ambulance if you fall in your

bathroom and can’t get up It removes rust
paint blood and pet odors And that’s not all

EXT BLACK INC LOADING DOCK - DAY

The delivery truck pulls up to the loading dock and is loaded up with boxes of
the BLACK BOX

TOE JACKSON
(v0)
The whole operation is right here Hundreds
and hundreds of employees

INT BLACK INC ASSEMBLY LINE

Black Boxes run down an assembly line belt as workers in black lab coats and
safety goggles monitor their manufacture We follow a BLACK BOX as it goes
down the assembly line which dissolves into--

INT BLACK INC COMPUTER LABS

The image of a BLACK BOX rotates in 3-d on a computer monitor Men and
women at banks of computers working

TOE JACKSON
(v0)
Development to manufacturing to shipping
One centralized location

A woman in her mid-30s (JANE JACKSON) talks to another employee and
nods at the image on the computer screen

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)
(v0)
This is where my parents work

INT BLACK INC BOARDROOM

A bunch of suits sit at a huge black conference table A man in his mid-30s
(BOB JACKSON) stands at the head of the table A giant screen behind him
projects sales and growth figures for the company
sShorts- 012908 draft - 3

TOE JACKSON

(v0)
Around here its where everyone’s parents
work Our neighborhoods surround Black Box
industries All employees live on premises
So as you can imagine there’s always
something going on in our little community
but these past few days took the cake

Suddenly a huge chunk of the Black Box building explodes from it and lands in
the neighborhood street Something big hit the building from behind We can
almost see it

The people in the street all back up turning to face some other giant
“something” that is upon them They almost trip over a giant CRATER in the
middle of the street

Millions of DUNG BEETLES swarm out Then

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)
(voice-over)
No no no Wait Is that how it went It’s all so
fuzzy Lemme see Go back a bit

Dung Beetles swarm in fast-rewind back into the hole This time a tiny
SPACESHIP emerges from the hole followed by countless others They zoom
toward the camera then freeze-frame

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)
(voice-over)
Yeah don’t think that was it either If start
with something know happened itll trigger
my memory and Ill get the story right Let’s go
back a ways

The picture then rewinds rapidly through the entire movie

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)
(narrating)
Wait
(rewinding stops)
Go forward a bit Let me actually start HERE
(picture freezes)
by telling you about the CLEANEST KID in
the world A kid everyone calls NOSE
sShorts- 012908 draft - 4

Disembodied head of the kid pops up as if out of a TOASTER with a WET
SNEEZY sound His name appears beneath his big air-filled noggin

“Nose” Noseworthy in BIG BAD BOOGER

(MUSIC COMES UP “BLINDED ME WITH SCIENCE” by Thomas Dolby)

EXT NOSE’S HOUSE - DAY

Nose’s house sits at the end of a street away from the others As Toe narrates
we see images that illustrate his words

TOE JACKSON
(v0)
A few years ago Nose and were in the same
elementary school together We were best
friends

Photos of NOSE and TOE where Nose is PICKING HIS NOSE

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)
(vo)
His father Dr Noseworthy was a really
important scientist for Black Inc But one day
while studying dirt and germs and basically
getting too close to his research his father
just flipped

We see DR NOSEWORTHY 30’s go SAUCER-WIDE EYED looking under a
super duper micro-scope We see him obsessively scrubbing his hands
Washing everything he touches

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)
(vo)
He was suddenly afraid of everything E-coli
Avian flu Staph infections Germs Smog
Basically the world

DR NOSEWORTHY takes Nose from school puts him in the (now plastic
covered) backseat of the car and takes off They go into the house and shut the
door

It dissolves to the Nose house with a clear ANTI CONTAMINATION BUBBLE
around it
sShorts- 012908 draft - 5

EXT NOSE’S HOUSE - (PRESENT) DAY

TOE JACKSON
(v0)
Dr Noseworthy threatened to quit his job at
Black Inc unless he was allowed to set up
his own lab in his house don’t think the
boss Mr Black liked that at all Mr Carbon
Black owner of Black Inc

We see a shot of a disapproving MR BLACK 40’s up in the Black Inc top floor
window looking down disapprovingly on the bag covered house below He
turns and walks away from the window

CLOSE-UP of computer monitor showing a detailed blueprint for some kind of
invention on it Keyboard clicks then file CLOSED with TOP SECRET window

across it

TOE JACKSON (CONT’D)
(v0)
No one knows what Dr Noseworthy’s working
on now Not even Nose knows And if Nose
knows no one knows what Nose knows
cause not even HE’S around Nose was
locked up that day and never came out again

Shot of NOSE in a room alone surrounded by monitors that show the world
outside

Shot of an attractive high school age girl wearing glasses short bob cut with
perfectly glued curls by her ears walking to the house This is STACEY
JACKSON NOSE’S TUTOR

She stops as she notices a shiny Rainbow Colored ROCK on the ground
picks it up and pockets it before going inside

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)
(v0)
So Nose got homeschooled And everyday the
tutor came she had to be decontaminated in
the decontamination chamber before starting
Nose’s lessons know because she’s my
sister STACEY
shorts- 012908 draft - 6

INT DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER

White walls very 2001 an oval shaped closet-sized room is lined up in the
foyer just after you enter the front door Think “next stage” of airport security

TUTOR enters and the door SHUSHES SHUT behind her As Toe describes
the process it happens to Stacey

TOE JACKSON
(v0)
First she’d get the ion blast Then the delta
and gamma blasts Then she’d get the zap of
quick-freeze to kill any bugs that might be on
her even the tiny little mites that live on her
eyelashes

ZOOM IN to see the tiny little mites that live on her eyelashes They give a HIGH-
PITCHED SCREAM then FREEZE flake off and die as they fall to the ground
and are sucked up by the vacuum vent

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)
Id like to say it’s just my sister that needs this
kind of high-density deep cleaning but truth is
- EVERYONE has mini mites living in their
eyelashes It’s true Look it up

INT DAD’S LAB

A sealed white room Dad sits on a stool his arms tucked inside gloves fitted
into a box with three-inch glass around it Protective goggles shield his eyes
He’s holding something gingerly with the protective gloves inside the glass
box Below it is a dark metal square

NOSE
Dad

DR NOSEWORTHY
Aaaah

Noseworthy drops the vial onto the square It smashes into a smoky inky
mess

DR NOSEWORTHY (CONTD)
Didnt tell you not to sneak up on me in
here

DR NOSE takes a hit from an asthma inhaler
sShorts- 012908 draft - 7

DR NOSEWORTHY (CONTD)
Don’t break --

Nose knocks over a beaker It shatters on the floor

DR NOSEWORTHY (CONT’D)
-- anything

NOSE
Sorry My tutor’s here was looking for your
scientific calculator mine’s broken

Dr Noseworthy hits a switch and the lights go out He hits a button on his
protective goggles and can see Nose in glowing blacklight Another button
magnifies his view

DR NOSEWORTHY
Have you been keeping yourself clean

NOSE
Of course

DR NOSEWORTHY
If only you could see what see

He turns the lights back on and starts to clean up the mess in the glass box

DR NOSEWORTHY (CONT’D)

Please don’t interrupt me anymore today The
cell regulator still isn’t working and I’ve got to
adjust the chromosomal relay tried
recalibrating the mitochondrial synthesizer but
can’t get it to work in an extracellular
environment On top of it all had a bad night
A very very bad night

Nose holds up a shredded Bio Suit(will see reason later in movie) Dr
Noseworthy finishes cleaning up the mess inside the glass case He turns
around just in time to see Nose pick his nose

DR NOSEWORTHY (CONTD)
What do you think you’re doing

NOSE
(finger up his nose)
Huh
sShorts- 012908 draft - 8

DR NOSEWORTHY
How many times have told you not to pick
your nose It’s completely unsanitary

Nose flicks the booger away and it falls on his dad’s experiment pad Dad
doesn’t see and closes the glass case

NOSE
Uh dad

DR NOSEWORTHY
If you got a nose full of boogers you go to the
bathroom and clean it out with the
ANTISEPTIC WIPES

NOSE
Sorry Dad But

DR NOSEWORTHY

No BUTS When your BUTT’s full of doo you
don’t use your fingers to clean it out and eat it
do you No You go to the toilet and use the
antiseptic wipes The same should go for
your nose Boogers are like fecal matter It’s
waste Your body is trying to push it all the way
up and out

(does pushing up gesture)
but POP YOU put it right back into your mouth
and into your system and it has to start all
over again

NOSE
I’m sorry

Dr Noseworthy collapses into his stool

DR NOSEWORTHY
Go wash your hands with antibacterial soap
And then wipe them with the

NOSE
Sanitary wipes

DR NOSEWORTHY
(exasperated)
Yes The wipes I’m going to get some sleep
shorts- 012908 draft - 9

Noseworthy exits Nose looks at the booger now locked in the case shrugs
and leaves

INT KITCHEN TABLE

NOSE sits at the kitchen table Stacey steps out of the decontamination
chamber with her previously coiffed curls now in tangles sets down her
satchel and they begin their lesson

Stacey gives up trying to make a cellphone call and pulls her satchel up to the
desk A RAINBOW ROCK slides out

STACEY
can’t get a signal in here

NOSE
Yeah It’s all my dad’s equipment Interferes
with the microwaves or something What’s
this

STACEY
Pretty rock I’ve seen it before but how did it
end up outside your house

NOSE
You found it outside then it’s technically mine

STACEY
Well sure guess it’s been decontaminated

She hands Nose the rock He wipes it down It shines Bright

NOSE
(holds it to the lamp)
Whats it like out there today

Nose is mesmerized by the Rock

STACEY
Don’t you look out the window

NOSE

really show the sky
shorts- 012908 draft - 10

STACEY
You know you could go outside sometime It
wouldn’t kill you to get some fresh air

NOSE
That’s where you’re wrong So-called “fresh
air’ is loaded with all kinds of pollutants On
top of that you’ve got Ozone Watch and UV
rays and pollen and cedar and ragweed and --
I’m just not ready for that Its what Dad says
anyway

A door slams elsewhere in the house She flinches

STACEY
What’s up with your Dad

NOSE
He’s just stressed Something about the
mitochondrial relay

Nose holds the stone in his hands

NOSE (CONT’D)
just wish that his invention worked the way
it’s Supposed to
(the rock GLINTS)
He’d be less agitated

STACEY

STACEY

Maybe youll get lucky and he’ll go away Then

INT LAB
GIANT BOOGER oozes until it fills the glass case and shatters it The Booger
slides off the table like a HUGE SLUG growing bigger
INT DR NOSEWORTHY’S BEDROOM
Dr Noseworthy is lying in bed a sleepmask over his eyes He JOLTS when he
hears the crash lifts one side of the mask to reveal one wide eye
INT KITCHEN TABLE
Nose and STACEY hear the sound

STACEY
What was that

NOSE
Probably just Dad breaking things in his lab
again Ill go check on it

EXT FRONT DOOR

LOOGIE pushes Toe up the trellis to the second floor balcony Toe tries the
door on the balcony with his cast-bound arms It’s locked

LOOGIE
What are you doing He said he didn’t have it
shorts- 012908 draft - 13

TOE JACKSON
He was lying

LOOGIE
How could you tell

TOE JACKSON
His lips were moving

Toe uses his cast to BREAK the windowpane and unlock the door

LOOGIE
Are you crazy

TOE JACKSON
We HAVE to get that rock back before Nose
says the wrong thing and gets into trouble
Plus we get the rock back we can make
everything right again
INT DR NOSEWORTHY’S BEDROOM
Noseworthy rises from bed again ripping off the mask and flinging it aside

He spots a security monitor and sees LOOGIE and Toe breaking into the
house

DR NOSE
No no NO They’re contaminating my house

He rushes back and grabs a whole BOX full of Sanitary Wipes

INT LAB

BOOGERMONSTER is now man-size and slides across the floor leaving a
SLIME TRAIL in its wake

Nose opens the lab door and sees it He looks from the booger creature to the
lab device and realizes what has happened

NOSE
Oh no
shorts- 012908 draft - 14

INT HALLWAY

Dr Noseworthy comes down one end of the hall -- and LOOGIE and Toe down
the other They converge at the door of the LAB

DR NOSE
What are contaminators doing in my house
(recognizing Toe)
You YOU gave me this headache You and
that ROCK Both of you wipe yourselves down
quickly

He slaps giant wipes on their heads sliming them STACEY appears

STACEY
Toby You’re not supposed to be in here You
want me to lose my job

DR NOSEWORTHY
You know this hooligan

STACEY
He’s my brother

LOOGIE
(to Stacey)
Hi I’m Loogie

Nose comes rushing out of the lab rock in hand He slams the door shut

DR NOSEWORTHY
How did you get that ROCK

TOE JACKSON
need the rock back Nose

NOSE
Remember when you guys told me not to eat
my boogers

TOE JACKSONDADLOOGIE
A million times

NOSE
Well now my booger is trying to eat ME

Off blank expressions
shorts- 012908 draft - 15

DR NOSEWORTHY
Oh no I’ve transferred my totally rational
phobia of unclean things into you son

NOSE
I’m serious My own BOOGER is trying to eat
ME

TOE JACKSON

Give me the rock
Loogie tackles Nose and the rock goes flying
In slo-mo--

The LAB DOOR bursts open and the BOOGERMONSTER appears -- its
GAPING HOWLING MOUTH OPEN -- and the RAINBOW ROCK gets SUCKED
INSIDE IT

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)
Oh NO

Dr Noseworthy’s eyes go wide

DR NOSE
told you not to pick your nose Now look
what you’ve done

Noseworthy activates a second Plexiglas door that separates them from the
Boogermonster It splats against the Plexiglas and slides its body around
making gross sounds and faces

NOSE
How could it get that big

DR NOSE
It must have triggered the chromosomal relay
on the cell regulator But that means

NOSE
Your invention works My wish came true

Loogie and Toe exchange looks The BOOGERMONSTER howls

DR NOSEWORTHY
Nonsense The relay must have reset itself
and began spontaneous replication
(MORE)
shorts- 012908 draft - 16

DR NOSEWORTHY (CONTD)
But even that has its limits unless the

organism restores its primary genetic
material

NOSE
Meaning

DR NOSEWORTHY
It has to keep feeding to stay intact

LOOGIE
Well since humans eat boogers I’d guess
that booger wants to eat humans

STACEY
That is the stupidest logic I’ve ever heard

The Plexiglas begins to crack--

STACEY (CONT’D)
But it’s making a lot of sense

The Boogermonster crashes through this barrier

DR NOSEWORTHY
The decontamination chamber

They race toward it -- the BOOGERMONSTER surprisingly fleet-footed following
them quickly behind

TOE JACKSON
Not without the rock

LOOGIE
Forget it we’ve lost this round

LOOGIE has to push and pull Toe along Toe drawn to the rock hidden inside
the BOOGERMONSTER

DR NOSEWORTHY
Get them through Ill be right back with my
cellular devoluminizer

NOSE
But youll have to go through that thing

DR NOSEWORTHY
Not through Over
shorts- 012908 draft - 17

Noseworthy lowers his goggles and trudges deliberately toward the booger
monster

INT DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER
STACEY reaches it first

NOSE
One at a time One at a time

STACEY steps inside It almost shushes shut behind her but LOOGIE dives in
with her and holds her hand They’re zapped together and are squirted out the
other side

LOOGIE
(to STACEY)
Hello again

Nose rolls his eyes

INT HALLWAY

Noseworthy eyes the configuration of items along the hallway -- light fixtures
doorknobs wall hangings -- and mumbles his calculations As he nears the
Boogermonster he springs into action climbing the walls using those
footholds and catapulting himself over the Boogermonster He lands safely on
the other side with a smile and heads into his lab

At the entrance to the decontamination chamber Nose grabs Toe

NOSE
Youre next

Toe tries to put up a fight

TOE JACKSON
Wait need that rock

Toe swings Nose into the decontamination chamber door denting it Now it
wont close

NOSE
No Are you crazy It’s just a rock Ill order you
one online
(0s)

That’s how we get everything around here

shorts- 012908 draft - 18
NOSE (CONTD)
Food supplies It all comes to the door We
never even have to step OUTSIDE

Toe jams his hand inside the Creature’s belly but is grabbed by the monster
who then carries him up to his mouth

STACEY and Loogie are trapped on the other side of the Decontaminator
Nose tries to figure out what to do The monster is in front of him He thinks
thinks thinks

NOSE (CONTD)
Think think think

EUREKA Nose shoves his finger into his nose DRAMATICALLY and pulls out a
fresh booger

He WAVES it in front of the approaching BOOGERMONSTER

NOSE (CONT’D)
Wait If you eat my friend

(BoogerMonster stops)

NOSE (CONTD)
Ill Eat YOURS

The boogermonster’s one good eye goes wide

He drops Toe instantly who falls on his butt

Toe joins him as they back into the decontaminator

Nose flicks the booger and goes inside

The Booger catches his lil’ friend and rocks him back and forth like a baby

NOSE (CONTD)
That’s weird

Decontaminator door shuts and cycle begins They come out the other side
Decontaminator door shushes shut behind them

LOOGIE
Okay NOW let’s get out of here

They start to run but STACEY Toe and LOOGIE see Nose is too scared to go
outside
shorts- 012908 draft - 19

TOE JACKSON
What are you waiting for

NOSE
haven’t been outside in years I’m not ready

Booger monster ROARS and smashes the decontaminator getting him that
much closer to Nose

TOELOOGIESTACEY
NOSE

NOSE
(frantic)
know know But still don’t think I’m ready

Tough decision for him Contamination outside contamination inside

EXT NOSE’S HOUSE
They blast out the front door a terrified Nose LEADING THE WAY

HIGH VIEW shot as the kids run away from house There are no other houses
built immediately around it just dirt patches

They all trip and fall in mud Nose goes flying face first in it He lifts up into a
standing position can’t believe he’s muddy He can’t move he’s so
flabbergasted

The door explodes BOOGERMONSTER exits and goes for Nose

Nose shuts his eyes as the BOOGERMONSTER zeroes in on him Dr
NOSEWORTHY appears at the front door with his DEVOLUMINIZER in hand
He ZAPS the Boogermonster with a beam that sucks it up like snot through a
straw into a thick glass JAR at the end The RAINBOW ROCK isn’t sucked
through but lands with a plop on the ground bouncing towards Toe

Nose opens his eyes

TOE JACKSON
Are you okay

LOOGIE
You did it on your own

Dad walks up with the shrunken booger monster inside the tank Roaring
shorts- 012908 draft - 20
DR NOSEWORTHY
This will make a fine specimen
Toe grabs the rock

TOE JACKSON
Good seeing you Nose Gotta go

Loogie and Toe run off
STACEY

Maybe we should talk about a raise

INT NOSEWORTHY HOUSE

Nose goes on about his adventure and how great it was that he was able to
run outside on his own and that he really was ready all while dad cleans him
off with the antiseptic wipes

DR NOSEWORTHY
hope you learned your lesson though
know go on about hygiene and cleanliness
but do it for a reason Don’t ever ever ever
EVER -

Nose had stopped talking He’s making a strange tight face Almost breaking a
sweat

DR NOSEWORTHY (CONT’D)
Whats the matter Say something

Nose squeezes out a tiny fart sound He’s mortified

The fart is suddenly a giant FOUL green GAS monster ROARING at them
THEIR HAIR STANDS ON END

CUT TO BLACK We hear the Devoluminizer

TOE JACKSON

(vo)
Sorry got ahead of myself again
know that was a little out there but it’s ALL
TRUE Every single bit of it You don’t believe
me Maybe should go back when first
came into possession of the rainbow colored
rock

Toe checks himself in the mirror He raises his arms in a stretch and we see
he has NO CASTS ON

TOE JACKSON
(v0)
Since didn’t explain before my name is
Toby Toby Jackson wanted to give you an
idea of how start every morning Maintaining
a mouth like this is no small task

He opens his mouth to reveal braces rubberbands wires etc

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)
First use a special toothbrush between the
wires and my gums to loosen any food
particles that may have lodged in my braces
(MORE)

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)
Then start on the outside of my upper teeth

positioning the bristles at a 45 degree angle
brushing toward the gum in a circular motion
like this do the inside and the tops the same
way then repeat the whole process for the
lower set Rinse Spit Wash my toothbrush
Mirror check

Camera starts to pan away

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)
No no Not done yet Now floss and use a
special pick to get under the brackets Rinse
Spit Mirror check

Camera starts to pan away again

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)
Nope Still more Next use a water squirter
that helps remove food particles that the

EXT FRONT OF SCHOOL - DAY

Wild ZOOM into a GANG OF KIDS
shorts- 012908 draft - 23

GANG
TOE

They bound into action grab Toe and drag him across the school grounds
Their leader is a grubby-looking punk named COLE BLACK

TOE JACKSON

(v0)
Somehow got the nickname “Toe” guess
because “Toby” was too long and
complicated for these geniuses That grubby-
looking punk is Cole Black Not to be
judgemental just so you know who the bad
guys are

The drag-out ends with the COLE AND THE GANG dropping him
unceremoniously head-first into a trash can

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)
(V0)
You’re probably thinking “This has got to be
the worst kid in the whole school” Well you
havent met his sister HELVETICA BLACK

Camera pans over as HELVETICA steps up smiles revealing a MOUTHFUL
OF BRACES

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)
(v0)
The leader of the pack (And coincidentally the
only one in the school with braces worse than
mine)

Hi Miles

A COOL BLACK FISH swims into view seeming to wink at TOE

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)
(v0)
Miles Davis My main fish And sadly about
the only friend have in this whole rotten
school Don’t get me wrong It’s a really good
school It’s just the people in it that suck

LOOGIE
In olden times they burned scientists at the
stake and called them witches Because the
townspeople didn’t understand science and
they thought it was magic Like using a magic
rock to make wishes come true

TEACHER
Loogie
LOOGIE
Yeah
TEACHER
You didn’t do the assignment did you
LOOGIE
did But a crocodile ate my homework

Really

Class laughs

WASPS

HELVETICA
Scientists who study wasps have long
observed aggressive behavior in stronger
females toward the weaker males of the
colony including threats of stinging and
mauling

She produces a trashcan

HELVETICA (CONTD)
But recently they’ve discovered that some
females will force a male headfirst into an
empty cell in the nest a behavior known as
“male-stuffing” I’d like to demonstrate this
phenomenon with this trashcan and a

TOE JACKSON
(v0)
I’ve heard all about how when youre older
nobody really cares that you were picked on
as a kid that basically one day all the stuff
that’s so important now wont matter a single
bit

Toe drops his leftovers into the trash and sucks the last bit of chocolate milk
from a straw with that last-bit-of-chocolate-milk sound Cole and the Gang rush
Toe and dump him headfirst into the trashcan then snicker and walk away
Toe’s feet stick out of the trashcan helplessly Helvetica saunters by

Consider it a bonus dump

between houses towards a neighborhood park

serpentines into a trench and out the other end

One of Cole’s THUGS runs out of rocks and picks up THE RAINBOW ROCK
He’s about to throw it but he stops in mid-throw and stares strangely at the
rock

Toe scrambles up a tree Cole reaches to pick up a rock but a SCORPION is
on top of it arching its stinger Cole recoils

COLE
(searching)
Give me a rock Give me a rock

Cole grabs the RAINBOW ROCK out of THUG’s hand and lobs it at Toe It
bounces off Toe’s head as Toe is KNOCKED OUT COLD He goes sideways
stuck between the branches

INT SCHOOL HALLWAY

Toe is slightly levitated again allowing him to zig-zag effortlessly among the
throng of kids in the hallway Papers fly as he whizzes through the crowd The
bell rings and the kids all head toward the classrooms

Toe reaches the door to the classroom and looks around to see he’s in the
clear He’s about to enter when Helvetica steps in front of him

HELVETICA
You missed our little appointment Care to re-
schedule

TOE JACKSON

Youll have to talk to my secretary Not to

INT SCIENCE LAB CLASSROOM

Toe walks past the aquarium toward his seat makes sure no one’s looking
then talks into his jacket lapel

TOE JACKSON
There’s a candy bar in my front pocket and my
Black Box is in music mode in case you get
hungry or bored

He turns to see HELVETICA looking at him

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)

HELVETICA
Then who The voices in your head

TEACHER
Were going to continue with our experiments
with combustible liquids so everyone needs
to take their seats and be sure to wear eye
protection
shorts- 012908 draft - 37

INT POCKETS

Aliens flick on their lights They find candy bars The Black Box re-configures so
the speakers pop out Eat and jam Party time

INT SCIENCE LAB
Toe trying to keep his jacket on Helvetica eyes him suspiciously

TEACHER
Now that you’ve isolated the agents for the
experiment you can make a hypothesis as to
the outcome

The aliens are dancing in his clothes Toe tries to sit still but he can’t Inside
his clothes the aliens turn up the iPod louder -- loud enough for others to hear
the music

TEACHER (CONT’D)
Toby can you stifle your inner High School
Musical long enough to observe this chemical
reaction

He sticks his hand into his pocket to retrieve the Black Box but the aliens wont
let it go He finally jerks it free but smashes it into Helvetica’s face

HELVETICA
Ow

TOE JACKSON
Oops

TEACHER

If you’re not going to pay attention to the
experiment at least you can make yourself
useful and feed the fish

HELVETICA
Ill do it

Helvetica walks over to the aquarium

The aliens climb out of Toe’s pockets and hunt for the iPod Toe doesn’t notice
his eyes are fixed on Helvetica

She scoops “Miles Davis” the fish out of the aquarium and holds him up
between her fingers The whole class is watching HER and not TEACHER
shorts- 012908 draft - 38

LOOGIE doesn’t notice as the spaceships start beaming candy bars out of his
pocket (well find out why he has so many candy bars later)

TEACHER
Now to get back to our experiment Once we
introduce the catalyst--

TOE JACKSON
Dont do it

TEACHER
Oh Toby’s correct You must be certain to add
the proper amount of catalyst in this case
one drop

Toe shakes his head slowly “no” Helvetica shrugs then DROPS THE FISH
INTO HER MOUTH AND SWALLOWS

TOE JACKSON
That’s it

He throws his jacket open with a big flourish

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)
Say hello to my little friends

Nothing happens Toe starts checking his pockets for the aliens but they’re
gone

TEACHER
Uh Toby think you need to go to the
Principal’s office Possibly the school
psychologist

Toe TACKLES Helvetica around the midsection and she OOFS the fish out of
her mouth -- it sails into the air and SLAPS the TEACHER who squeezes a
stream of the chemical from the dropper into the beaker The experiment goes
KABLOOEY as they both go FLYING OUT the open WINDOW -- the spaceship
catches the fish and lands it safely back in the aquarium

Explosion FRIGHTENS the spaceships -- they rear back and begin zooming
around the room zapping things

TEACHER (CONT’D)
That wasn’t supposed to happen

Kids duck for cover The spaceships zap everything trying to find a way out
shorts- 012908 draft - 39
They knock over things as they go sending the teacher and other school props
flying
The classmates are actually enjoying the mayhem

The spaceships zoom out the window

EXT OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL - DAY

at a table in the cafeteria A sign on the table reads “DETENTION ZONE” They
have to sit alone with each other Their food trays are in front of them but
they’re in stare-down mode Loogie sits across from them

Toe reaches for a roll with his bandaged hands and tries to bring it to his
mouth It falls in the soup splashing him

HELVETICA
Ha-ha

TOE JACKSON
Well let’s see you do it

Helvetica kicks off her shoes and her feet appear over the table like an extra
pair of hands amazing control and poise Her toes wiggle

Her foot lifts the spoon while the other one grabs the roll and she scoops soup
to her mouth and takes a bite of the roll She drops the spoon with the right foot
and grabs her cup and takes a sip of the drink

She then grabs the butter knife cuts a slab of butter and spreads it on the roll
in her other foot She holds the roll out to him Toe refuses LOOGIE swoops in
and takes it smiles and eats it

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)
(v0)
So we werent exactly friends but at least we
were no longer enemies And where did my
other friends go couldn’t say But had a

They look at each other trying to figure out if it worked

VOICE
It is I

They turn to look to see where it was coming from They look at their little 2 year
old sister standing nearby

LOOGIE
Did you just say something

VOICE
My modes of transference are beyond yours
now don’t need words to communicate Only
thoughts You are hearing me with your
MINDS

Their jaws literally DROP to the ground As the jaws clang to the ground a
gumball bounces out of Loogie’s

He hands the rock to Laser

LOOGIE
Youre right
EXT BACKYARD - DAY
They walk outside
LOOGIE

am completely heartbroken
Laser closes his eyes to make a wish and a CATAPULT APPEARS
Loogie reluctantly places the rock in the catapult as Laser starts setting it up

LOOGIE (CONT’D)
Just think of all the things we could do

LASER
Too risky

LOOGIE
We could-

LASER

Too dangerous

LOOGIE
How about-

LASER
Too ridiculous

He’s ready to launch A beat

LASER (CONTD)
Although We could take care of that world
peace problem

LOOGIE
Now youre talking

They reach for the rock and the catapult fires off They turn stunned looks on
their faces Baby sister is there with the switch

BABY
My calculations show You would have
figured out a way to screw it up

She nods and walks off

LOOGIE
Who Us

They turn and see the rock fly at least several blocks away over houses and
several neighborhoods

TOE JACKSON

(v0)
So maybe baby was smart to get rid of it But

it didn’t really matter Because the rock
keptcoming back You should see how it
changed things for my mom and dad Boy did
it ever

The movie suddenly fast forwards through episode 2 and stops

Disembodied heads of adults pop up as if out of a TOASTER with cellphone

Closer to what

We pan over the long mirror and realize they are in the same room not 5 feet
from each other

MOM JACKSON
Look at us We’re in the same ROOM and
were still texting each other What happened
to two people talking

He finally looks up at her reflection in the mirror and sees her making eye
contact

JACKSON
We live in a fast-moving world and these
gadgets made by the company we work for by
the way keep us connected

MOM JACKSON
But we’re disconnected Don’t you see

JACKSON

MOM JACKSON

that way

She picks up the purse on the ground looks around She peers closer to the
place where MOMDAD lie hidden

Mom and Dad have their hands over each others mouths shushing each

TOE drives up on his bicycle and hops off behind her startling her

She wheels around and whacks him with the PURSE

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)

Cole bounds in and tackles Toe dumping Toe into the kitchen trashcan

COLE

HELVETICA

Cole instantly morphs into a tiny Dung Beetle and scurries across the kitchen
floor All the servers and kitchen workers try to stomp on him as he zigzag to
avoid their feet

COLE
(in tiny bug voice)
Help meeeee

HELVETICA
Wow

Helvetica stunned Gets whacked byToe (who still has the Trashcan on his

MomDad quickly scan the trays looking for the stone bumping into other odd
costumes

They are trying to walk through the crowd and get in step with each other
shorts- 012908 draft - 69

MOM JACKSON
(low to Dad)
So far so good Nobody’s really noticed us
Try and stay in step

JACKSON
Let’s just find the rock and change ourselves
so can seal the deal

Some people talk business Mom notices how even though people are talking
they’re secretly carrying on text conversations behind their backs or just out of
eyesight

MOM JACKSON
Look at that Half communication with each
other at best It’s not natural

JACKSON
You and me stuck together like Chang and
Eng THAT’S not natural

INT KITCHEN

Helvetica stands by the refrigerator whispering to Dung Beetle Cole as servers
pass He’s hiding behind the fridge squealing

HELVETICA
I’m gonna change you back Just stay here so

Toe yanks Helvetica’s ponytail

TOE JACKSON
Give me that rock back

HELVETICA
My brothers a bug

TOE JACKSON

We go together Like Siamese twins

INT PARTY
The door opens to Mr Noseworthy in full germ free biohazard suit

BLACK
Mr Noseworthy welcome And in a full anti-
germ body suit same as every year How
consistent Come in you’re late That’s also
consistent

We follow the tray with the rock as it goes to Noseworthy Mr Noseworthy
reaches past the rock for an hors d’oeuvre and tries to bring it to his mouth but
the biohazard costume blocks his face

Music plays Toe and Helvetica dance with their locked casts to get across the
party but they’re tracking servers and their trays

HELVETICA
First thing we do is wish off these casts My
arms are scratchy bloated masses of scabby
flesh

TOE JACKSON
Not while there’s food near please

At the opposite end of the room MomDad are doing the same thing but much
clumsier

DAD JACKSON
Will you let me lead

MOM JACKSON
I’m trying to but you’ve got two left feet

BLACK
need everyone’s attention

All the partygoers look to Black who stands above them all on a dais

BLACK (CONT’D)
VERSION X OF THE BLACK BOX -- is delayed
indefinitely
(crowd reacts)
No no
(MORE)
shorts- 012908 draft - 71

BLACK (CONT’D)
made a promise to myself and more

importantly to the world that would never
release an upgrade that wasn’t worthy of the
Black mantle Version X has simply failed to
meet our highest standards of “wow” So
come to you with this message Do whatever
it takes Industrial espionage Fine Traffic in
trade secrets Perfect Murder Well only you
know what you must do

Mom and Dad nervously scratch and adjust their tie etc with each other’s
hands They’re not quite in sync

BLACK (CONT’D)
Whoever comes to me with the magic
solution can have just about any position he
wants at Black Inc Maybe even mine
(laughs)
No but you get the idea That’s how important
itis

Mom and Dad BOTH put their hands up

JACKSON

MOM JACKSON
My hand is up for a reason

JACKSON
You didn’t tell me you were going for the
same promotion

MOM JACKSON
Yes did emailed you or texted you
Possibly both

BLACK
Well TWO entries from the same household
Now that’s the competitive go for the throat
spirit I’m talking about

Toe and Helvetica and MomDad spot the server with the rock on his tray
walking toward Black

HELVETICA
Over there
shorts- 012908 draft - 72

BLACK
(taking the rock off tray)
One for all and all for ME mean us

Everyone claps MomDad watching Black closely ToeHelvetica too

BLACK (CONT’D)
wish each and every one of you had that “GO
FOR THE THROAT” spirit

Giant BLAST of GLOW sweeps over the entire ROOM

EVERYONE in the PARTY turns to the person next to him and STARTS
CHOKING THEM Black can’t believe his eyes

Noseworthy’s eyes go WIDE behind the biohazard mask as someone
RUSHES him and tackles him to the ground

ONLY HELVETICATOE cant do it -- because they can’t REACH EACH
OTHER’S NECKS

BLACK (CONT’D)
What’s happening What are you doing Have
you all gone mad

People are fighting each other mayhem has broken out

Tiny DUNG COLE steps out from under the kitchen door to see the mayhem
and scurries through their feet

MomDad come stumbling through the partygoers like a mad beast They try to
avoid the mad grabs of the others

MOM JACKSON
Remember our yoga
(calling out yoga positions)
Eagle pose Cobra pose Locust pose Half-
tortoise

MomDad do the positions quick-like and knock people out of their way

Black lets the rock drop from his hand -- and MomDad and HelveticaToe run
for it -- both meeting in the middle

TOE JACKSON
Mom Dad Mom Dad

Helvetica forces Toe down and they snag the rock
shorts- 012908 draft - 73

BOTH
Give us the rock

BLACK
Jackson Do you know what’s happening

JACKSON
Mr Black think I’ve found the solution to your
little upgrade problem

HELVETICA
I’ve got the rock now Dad We can have
anything we want Just wish for it

BLACK
This is all your doing isn’t it We’re here to
talk about a box A BLACK box Not a round
colorful rock This BOX needs to be able to do
everything This is the last straw Helvetica
Go to your ROOM

HELVETICA
wish you would JUST LISTEN TO ME for a
CHANGE

Black’s ears start to GROW-- his expression changes Helvetica’s the boss

TOE JACKSON
Helvetica Don’t

HELVETICA
wish these casts were off

Both Helvetica’s and Toe’s casts disappear

HELVETICA (CONTD)
No not his just mine

Toe’s reappear

TOE JACKSON
You’re mad right now and your wishes are
coming out of your anger

HELVETICA
wish for a rocket bike

A rocket bike appears She hops on revs up
shorts- 012908 draft - 74

TOE JACKSON
know what it’s like to think no one’s your
friend Helvetica I’m your friend

She shuts her eyes then opens them SMILES WIDE -- NO BRACES

HELVETICA
See ya stooges

She revs up and barrels out the front door narrowly missing tiny Dung Beetle
Cole

Mom and Dad run after her and they get on Toe’s bike

DAD JACKSON
Are you crazy

MOM JACKSON
want that rock Now PEDAL

The MAYHEM of the MOB spills out into the front yard Helvetica looks back at
the mob She immediately crashes and flies RIGHT INTO A TRASHCAN
Upended

TOE JACKSON
Will you look at that

The rock goes rolling down the street

MOM JACKSON
Faster

DAD JACKSON
(struggling uphill)
can’t

MOM JACKSON
(pedaling)
wished us to be closer but it’s the same
problem Were close physically but we’re
disconnected Not in sync

(A pratfall to illustrate the point follows)

The rock rolls past MomDad on the bike They start to go backwards downhill
shorts- 012908 draft - 75

EXT OUTSIDE BLACK’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Toe sees the rock rolling downhill Gaining speed Starts to run toward it

MomDad hit the curb backwards and go flying into the front lawn towards the
house

The rock breaks through the huge front window making a tiny hole A beat later
the ENTIRE WINDOW breaks open as the bike and everyone else comes
pouring in

Toe raises the rock high

TOE JACKSON
wish you were all back to normal

MOMDAD become two separate people with a loud sound like velcro
separating

People who were fighting shake the mess from their clothes and shake hands
reluctantly

Noseworthy bio-suit in tatters stumbles through the house

NOSEWORTHY
Contaminators All of you

Toe runs to the front door and opens it

Helvetica is there covered in trash looking worse for wear She lunges for the
rock but Toe maneuvers away

Toe runs out the window but she still grabs for him so he spins like a discus
thrower and flings the rock far away

INT HOUSE

Mr Black realizes his ears are back to normal He makes his way quickly
through the recovering crowd pushing aside the now-normal COLE and
heads to the window for the rock

BLACK
Well someone obviously spiked the Kool-Aid
You will remember none of this tomorrow

EXT HOUSE

Loogie leaps up and grabs it out of her hand and runs

BLACK
Get it Helvetica DO WHATEVER IT TAKES

HELVETICA
thought you told me not to bully

BLACK
Its not bullying if you WIN Now DO IT

She scowls at him for this goes against her antagonistic nature towards him
She also hates being told what to do

Helvetica turns back and leaps on them all tackling them to the ground
She squeezes the rock and it glows

Cut to the rock rolling out of the “pile up”

Nose grabs it and runs with it

They all chase Nose

MOM JACKSON
Where could he be

JACKSON
Well find him And well find that rock

MOM JACKSON
You want the rock after what happened to us

Just imagine what the company could do with
something like that--

Mom gives him a look like he’s suddenly drunk with power

JACKSON (CONTD)
Exactly So that’s why we have to destroy it

She smiles a proud smile at him

INT BLINKERS HOUSE

The BLINKERS sit in the front room still in their STARE-DOWN
Laser runs past them followed by kids and adults

Laser holds the rock high up above the other’s heads

LASER
wish had really long arms

They leap and jump flailing and grasping but Laser’s hands stretch to the
ceiling

Close on his hand as he mysteriously loses grip and the rock floats away
He and everyone else stare at it in wonder as it goes

LOOGIE
Somebody must’ve wished themselves
invisible

Just then Helvetica appears She has the Rock

She crawls back down to the floor (she was sticking to the ceiling like a spider)
and runs

They chase after her

She turns a corner and is gone

The others keep running
Close on a TOASTER sitting on the floor near a wall
All the children’s feet run past

The Toaster opens it’s “EYES” to see them all leave It’s Helvetica The toaster
smiles

LOOGIE (CONT’D)
Nope

He’s right there behind another section of the wall

Close on her shocked face as he depresses the toaster button forcing the
rainbow rock to pop out of the toaster slot

He catches it and runs as the others chase him in the other direction

Now a bouncing toaster Helvetica follows as best as she can making quite a
racket as she hops

EXT OUTSIDE

Loogie runs out of the house with the rock Surprised to see all the adults have
gathered there to see what the hell’s going on Toe’s parents Mr Noseworthy
all the employees

LOOGIE
I’ve got it

He slips and the rock goes rolling down the sidewalk
MR Black steps up and scoops up the rock

BLACK
Curb-side delivery That’s what call great
customer service NOW EVERYONE LISTEN
TO ME

Everyone stops Except Helvetica who’s still a toaster and hopping around
Someone steps on her cord to stop her and silence her

BLACK (CONT’D)
guess have to wish YOU back to normal

She CHANGES back to normal

BLACK (CONT’D)
said LISTEN UP everyone

Mom and Dad Jackson step up looking at each other nervously So do the
other gathering adults

BLACK (CONT’D)
YOURE ALL FIRED

Gasps As Black speaks his “wishes” come true

BLACK (CONT’D)
Because you see This little doo dad is the
ULTIMATE Black Box The only update well
EVER need Late last night it occurred to me
could fire you all and completely automate my
factory using this lovely little talisman No
pesky workman’s comp claims No
redecorating the break room Then thought
WAIT Why even automate the factory to make
little black boxes to sell at a profit when can
just forget the business altogether and simply
wish for a MOUNTAIN of MONEY

HE CLIMBS TO THE TOP OF THE MONEY platform that’s now under him and
that keeps rising till he’s several stories tall equal to the ROOF of the BLACK
INC BUILDING

EMPLOYEE

(yelling up)
What about profit sharing

BLACK
Let me think about it Hmm No Because you
see BLACK becomes COLORFUL
SQUARE becomes ROUND and YOU
become OBSOLETE While hold the KEY TO
THE WORLD

Helvetica and Toe exchange a look Toe just shakes his head
HELVETICA
(yelling up)
Come on Dad you MUST be joking

She winks at Toe
shorts- 012908 draft - 84

BLACK
OH my girl wish were

THE MONEY disappears and he starts to fall but manages to hang onto the
edge of the Black Inc roof

The rock rolls along the ledge All eyes on it Black edges closer to it Makes a
grab for it but misses it as it falls down into SECURITY GUY’s hand

BLACK (CONT’D)
Excellent Now wish me down safely

SECURITY GUY
You fired us remember

BLACK
I’m re-hiring you At double your salary Now
will you get me down from here

SECURITY GUY
don’t need your money Mr Black I’ve got the
rock My turn

Security Guy holds up the rock

DAD JACKSON
Dont do it

TOE JACKSON
(to kids)
We gotta ruin their wishes If the adults get
hold of that rock theyll wreck this place for
sure

LOOGIE
Right

SECURITY GUY
wish was an --

NOSE
(grabs security guy’s hand)
Oscar Meyer Weiner

Loogie let’s go just before the Rock GLOWS bright The security guy turns into
a big hot dog FRANK bouncing in the street The rock bounces

Helvetica and Cole dive for the rock at the same time -- both hands grab it
shorts- 012908 draft - 85

COLE

You already had a turn
HELVETICA

I’m taking another one
COLE

I’m sick and tired of taking orders from you
HELVETICA

You want to go head-to-head with me
COLE

Anytime

Helvetica holds it up

HELVETICA

wish were a giant WASP -- ten stories tall
With an army of GIANT ALIEN INSECTS at my
command

Since she has no hands the rock FALLS to the ground As she speaks her
body transforms and contorts into the giant WASP and the army mobilizes
behind her

HELVETICA (CONT’D)
(as giant wasp)
Insect Army -- ATTACK

The ALIEN INSECT ARMY swoops down on everyone People scramble
Cole takes the rock

COLE
wish was a GIANT DUNG BEETLE with a
GIANT DUNG BEETLE ARMY

It happens Cole contorts into a GIANT BEETLE with an ARMY OF BEETLES
behind him

The rock falls from his grasp and Laser catches it

LASER
wish for a giant flyswatter

A HUGE FLYSWATTER falls on top of him He struggles to get out from under it
Loogie heaves but it won’t budge
shorts- 012908 draft - 86
LASER (CONT’D)
Forget me Get the ROCK

The WASPS and SCORPIONS TEAR UP THE STREET They crush cars
houses in their wake

The NEIGHBORHOOD people scurry away
TOE JACKSON
(watching all the neighbors run)
There goes the neighborhood
INT HOUSE
The BLINKER kids are staring each other down by the front window
BLINKER 2 blinks Astonished at what’s outside

BLINKER 1
YOU BLINKED

BLINKER 2 mouthing silent words of awe
BLINKER 1 (CONT’D)
35 hours 15 minutes and 20 seconds and
YOU blinked YOU LOSE LOSER

We see creatures walking by as Blinker 1 gloats

EXT BLACK INC BUILDING
Black hanging from the roof WASPS fly by menacing him
Suddenly sees a GIANT TEENAGER watching the mayhem next to him

BLACK
You Come here Help me down

Big teen hoists Black down

BLACK (CONT’D)
Careful

Stacey runs out into the crowd Sees the big teen

STACEY
John

BOYFRIEND
You wished would grow up guess did
Stacey faints
Rock keeps rolling and rolling and rolling --
Right into Loogie’s and Toe’s hands

TOE JACKSON
We need backup

LOOGIE
wish for my Crocodile army

TOE JACKSON
wish for my alien friends

THE CROCODILES step out of the bushes The adults can’t believe their eyes
Mom Jackson spots Loogie’s BABY SISTER stepping into the mayhem

MOM JACKSON
Bob There’s a baby out there

A SWARM of tiny Spaceships flood from behind TOE causing even more
mayhem

Tiny ALIEN SPACESHIPS appear -- they beam onto the rock and lift it up again --
CROC KING swipes at them but the ROCK levitates away --
Into baby’s hands Her lips don’t move as she “speaks”
BABY SISTER
(v0)
Stop

Everything freezes

BABY
(v0)
You’ve made the ANIMATOR angry

TOE JACKSON
The what
shorts- 012908 draft - 88

BABY
(v0)
The Animator has given life to your petty
desires
LUG

Uh excuse me but why are any of you
listening to her She’s a BABY

LOOGIE
But it TOLD us it was a WISHING ROCK

BABY
And look at how you’ve used it How you’ve
squandered it In your greedy hands it could
mean the end of the world even the end of the
universe

LOOGIE
She’s right

LUG
Is it wrong to want to smack a baby

BABY waves a hand and an ALIEN SPACESHIP smacks LUG

LUG (CONTD)
Ow

Baby holds a hand to her face

LOOGIE
What’s wrong

BABY
The animator grows weary It cannot sustain
the strain on its powers

Baby drops the ROCK It spins like a gyroscope

LOOGIE
Whats it doing

TOE JACKSON
Its making it’s own wish

The ROCK starts to grow -- larger and larger and larger -- spitting out sparks

as it spins
shorts- 012908 draft - 89

Everything around them starts to UNFREEZE -- the battling armies of insects --
the CROC KING and his ARMY -- the battling parents --

A GIANT STORM CLOUD BREWS in the sky swirling lightning flashing
threatening to pour down on them all

The ROCK starts to change color One by one the bands of the rainbow fade
into grey and finally BLACK

Helvetica and Cole no longer giant insects fall to the ground

BABY
We have to get rid of it or it will destroy us all

JACKSON
How

DR NOSEWORTHY
I’ve got it Something I’ve been working on to
increase black box battery life

MR BLACK
Really

DR NOSEWORTHY
Germs that actually harness our energies to
power the Black Box It’s in the testing phase

He opens his coat and inside are WHITE JARS He opens them

ALL
Germs

DR NOSEWORTHY
Dip in Don’t worry they’re sanitized

They pass them around Noseworthy dips first Slimey wormy things

TOE JACKSON
don’t get it

DR NOSEWORTHY
They collect and magnify the energy from the
mitochondria in every cell in your body This
will eventually allow us to -
shorts- 012908 draft - 90

BLACK
Spare us the science lesson Noseworthy
what do we do

DR NOSEWORTHY
Hold hands

ALL
EWwww

DR NOSEWORTHY
Our own combined energy can get rid of the
Rock but we have to all stand together

They do

DR NOSEWORTHY (CONTD)
(to himself)
and hope didn’t accidently bring the jars of
snot

A power comes from them as they all hold hands They are fighting back
against the rock with their own inner energies

BABY
We know we have disrespected you leave
us now and we shall pick up the pieces
learning from our mistakes

Huge EXPLOSION Everything spinning around in a whirlpool -- all the
creatures and wishes-gone-bad sucked into the vortex all disappearing into
nothingness

BOOM

A quick FLASH OF TORRENTIAL RAINFALL on them They are drenched As
quickly as it came it went

The ROCK EXPLODES and is gone
A NEW RAINBOW appears in the distance

LOOGIE
A new rainbow Where is the end of it
shorts- 012908 draft - 91

TOE JACKSON
Far away guess for someone else to have a
chance Maybe theyll be a little smarter about
it

EXT STREETS - DAY

People pick up the pieces of their neighborhood and all can be whispering to
themselves and each other all the things they could have wished for things
that are good that they didnt think about all the missed opportunities

Camera tracks from person to person as they pick up their mess and dust off
their clothes

LASER
told you we should have wished for world
peace this never would have happened

TOE JACKSON
Maybe we’re supposed to figure it out
ourselves Anything else would be wishful
thinking

Stacey and her boyfriend in tattered HULK clothes walk arm in arm Exhausted
We see others reunite

Toe and Helvetica approach each other A TRASHCAN is rolling down the
street and stops between them hitting the curb and rolling top side up

TOE JACKSON (CONT’D)
Don’t even think about it

HELVETICA
That’s not what had in mind

Helvetica extends a hand
Toe takes it They shake
Mom and Dad walk up

MOM JACKSON
Is this your special friend

HELVETICA
(nods)
Im Helvetica
shorts- 012908 draft - 92

MOM
Nice to meet you

TOE JACKSON
(leaning over)
So we’re friends

HELVETICA
Let’s settle for “no longer enemies”

TOE JACKSON
Well it’s a good start

Camera pulls back on the scene fading into shots of the various players as
Toe describes them

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)
(v0)
So that’s pretty much how that week went
made some new friends Loogie and his
brothers got the adventure of their young lives
My parents are together For the first time
really or at least that’s how they put it

Shot of Mom and Dad doing yoga together beachside

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)
Nose and his Dad teamed up and continued
working on experiments in personal hygiene

Shot of Nose and Dr Noseworthy smiling as camera flashes and their picture
appears in the local paper

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)
My dad didn’t make partner but he and Mr
Black became friends Not best friends but
good friends seeing as how they might get to
be family someday

HELVETICA
Hold on never agreed to that

TOE JACKSON
You will

A shot of the black box
shorts- 012908 draft - 93

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)
The black box was never perfected In fact Mr
Black initiated a top-to-bottom redesign He
thought he should do something to change
the world for the better So he went GREEN

Recycling logo appears on the “black box” now GREEN

TOE JACKSON (CONTD)
But it could never do what the rainbow rock
could do And even if it could would we really
want it Sometimes wishing does make it
so SO be sure you’re wishing for something
worth wishing for

LOOGIE
wished we were in a Hollywood movie

HELVETICA
Yeah like that’s gonna happen

Loogie turns to face the camera Smiles BIG
CUT TO BLACK
THE END
