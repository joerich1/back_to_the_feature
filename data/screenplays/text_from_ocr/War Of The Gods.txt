Out of every HUNDRED men in battle there are TEN that
should not be there

Another EIGHTY are nothing more than targets

Only NINE are real fighters and we are lucky to have
them for they the battle make

But ONE ONE is a WARRIOR And it is he who brings the
others home

Heraclitus 2000 BC
SUPER GREEK DARK AGES 1900 BC
FADE UP
EXT MOUNTAINSIDE - EVENING
Clouds fill the sky as the wind howls and the heavens rumble
NARRATOR (VO)
Men tell tales of heroism For pride
for history’s sake They tell them to
glorify their own deeds

CUT TO

A YOUNG BOY’S blistered feet drudging up the mountain side
moving away from the sea battered coast

NARRATOR (CONT’D) (VO)
But this is no such story For there is
no hubris here

The boy’s woolen chlamys is sullen and torn it barely covers
his chest as it WHIPS in the wind

NARRATOR (CONT’D) (VO)
For this is the tale of the great hero
Theseus

The young boyTHESEUS continues up the mountain dragging his
empty fishing net behind him as

EXT MOUNTAIN PLATEAU - CONT

SOPHIA his mother wiry and austere spots him from atop
the plateau

The site of her beleaguered son pains her but she does her
all to hide it when suddenly a RUSTLING startles her

She spins around peering into the growing darkness But the
setting sun is of no use to her as the mountain peaks cast
down shadows

SOPHTA
Is someone there

No reply only more RUSTLING and the faint sound of WHISPERS

SOPHIA (CONTD)
Show yourself

Sophia reaches down picks up a STRIGIL a sharp husking
tool when just then

» a stone STRIKES her in the head She crumbles to the
ground as three TEENAGE VILLAGERS emerge from the weeds
wielding leather SLINGS
TEEN LEADER
Be gone whore

Sophia cowers back struggling to regain her balance

TEEN LEADER (CONT’D)
And take your bastard son with you

They HURL more stones and surround her when suddenly -- a
FISHING NET ensnares them The teens turn and see Theseus
charging towards them

One teen quickly frees himself takes aim and fires but
Theseus is a step ahead of him

he avoids the strike dives forward rolls and rises to
his feet -- CRACKING him across the face

Despite being younger Theseus fights with a ferocity the
teens cannot match He wrestles the leader to the ground and
grabs hold of the STRIGIL about to cut him down when --

SOPHTA
Theseus no

A blood-lust fills his eyes -- but he heeds his mother and
lets the teen go

NARRATOR (VO)
So was life for young Theseus for he
grew up an outcast along the frozen coast
of Northern Greece

The teens race off all the while cursing Theseus

NARRATOR (VO) (CONTD)
Many accused his mother of being a harlot
and a gypsy She was to blame when they
failed to pull fish from the sea She
was to blame when there was a drought
It was always her fault

INT HOVEL - CONT

Theseus enters followed by Sophia She moves to him but he
walks past her head hung low his blood still boiling

THESEUS
Why must we stay here

SOPHIA
Please honor my judgement

THESEUS
We should move on

SOPHIA
No
THESEUS
Why What purpose does it serve

Sophia sighs deeply thinking
SOPHIA
(pause)
Can you keep a secret

He doesn’t respond

SOPHIA (CONT’D)
Answer me

He begrudgingly nods
SOPHIA (CONTD)
You don’t understand this is something
you must guard with your life It must
be more precious to you than the air that
you breathe

THESEUS
What is it mother

SOPHTA
Follow me

EXT MOUNTAIN - EVENING

Sophia leads Theseus high up the mountain to a great boulder

SOPHTA
Take note of this stone and remember it
well

THESEUS

I don’t understand

SOPHIA
Try moving it

He just looks at her

SOPHIA (CONTD)
One day you’ll be able to And when that
day comes you can leave this village and
join your father

THESEUS
My father What are you talking about

SOPHIA
You are no bastard Theseus Your father
is a great man but he has an evil cousin
a very powerful lord with fifty sons
They are waiting for your father to die
so they can divide his land

(MORE )
SOPHIA (CONTD)
If they knew he had a son to inherit it
they would kill you This is the reason
we travel from town to town never taking
root This is why we live like gypsies

Theseus eyes her taken aback not knowing what to think

SOPHIA (CONT’D)
I swear to you it’s true

THESEUS
Then what is my father’s name

SOPHIA
I promised him I wouldn’t reveal his name
until you were strong enough to move this
stone and fight your enemies And to
that promise I am beholden

Theseus turns to the stone He places his hands on it and
pushes with all his might It doesn’t budge

SOPHIA (CONT’D)
Don’t worry one day you’1l1 move it and
your life will change forever

ON THESEUS as he eyes the stone

NARRATOR (VO)
Theseus didn’t know what to make of his
mother’s story When he was younger she
would tell him wild tales of the Fall
harvest to raise his spirits and help him
endure his hunger And while this felt
like one of those tall tales Theseus
couldn’t help but find some strange
comfort in it especially during the long
hard years that lied ahead

CROSS FADE TO
EXT OCEAN - DAY
Theseus now sixteen powers through chest high water
dragging his seining net Waves POUND him relentlessly but

he fights his way to shore where

- he quickly scours through his catch Disappointment fills
his face

EXT HOVEL - DAY

Sophia picks olives but the branches have wilted She does
her all to remain strong as

INT HOVEL - NIGHT

she makes a thin paste from the few olives she has culled
together She offers it to Theseus
THESEUS
No I’m fine You eat
SOPHIA
Well share it
THESEUS
If we do we’ll both be hungry
SOPHIA
Theseus --
THESEUS

No it’s better that one of us be

satisfied than the both of us be left

wanting I’m going to check on my traps
Suddenly a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM startles them
EXT HOVEL - CONT

Theseus quickly emerges carrying a small torch He sees a
buzz of activity in the village as Sophia joins him

SOPHIA
What’s going on

Torches move about and SHOUTING can be heard as the sound of
a terrible commotion nears

THESEUS
Go back inside

The noise grows louder it’s a dreadful combination of
trampling hooves iron pings and heavy breathing

Theseus pushes his mother inside and draws his dagger as

a huge shimmering mass charges towards him Theseus
throws down his torch and takes refuge in the darkness

REVEAL in the orange hue of the torchlight a GREEK HOPLITE
warrior encased in heavy brass armor atop a noble steed

Theseus emerges taken back He has never seen workings of
metal like this

HOPLITE ARCHON
You need not fear me I am an archon to
the Great King Petros I am in pursuit
of a demon

THESEUS
Demon

HOPLITE ARCHON
Yes Have you seen anything pass
THESEUS
No

HOPLITE ARCHON
Take shelter then and be at the ready
For these beasts know no mercy

The Hoplite blares out a SIGNAL with his horn as he charges
off In the distance Theseus hears the SOUND returned as

- the hoplites’ SIGNALS rain out like a chorus
SOPHIA
(from the door)
Come inside Theseus You heard what --
Suddenly a SNAP rings out followed by MUFFLED SCREAMS
Theseus’ hairs go on end as he turns towards one of his
traps

SOPHIA (CONTD)
Leave it be

Theseus thinks to himself

SOPHIA (CONTD)
Theseus please Let the hoplites --

But Theseus races off before she can stop him

EXT MOUNTAIN SIDE - CONT

Theseus approaches a pitfall trap eyeing the dugout trench
as something stirs below

He cautiously raises his torch to get a better look To his
surprise he sees

An OLD MAN ensnared at the bottom

THESEUS
Old fool what are you doing out here

OLD MAN
Please help me my leg is trapped

Theseus shakes his head in disbelief as he jumps down to
help

INT HOVEL - LATER

Sophia uses spider webs like sutures crisscrossing them over
the OLD MAN’s abrasions

OLD MAN
Thank you my lady
THESEUS
You could have gotten yourself killed out
there Why were you wandering about

OLD MAN
It is my nature I am a wanderer

The Old Man tests his leg as Sophia finishes

OLD MAN (CONTD)
Well done I am in your debt

He moves to exit

SOPHIA
You mustn’t go out there A demon is
about

THESEUS

Mother please such talk is forged by
superstition and fear Just as they call
us omens of misfortune so do they call
another a demon

OLD MAN

So you don’t believe in such things
THESEUS

Not at all
OLD MAN

Do you even know where demons come from
Theseus shakes his head ‘no’

OLD MAN (CONTD)
So you’ve never heard the story of the
gods

THESEUS
The gods The gods are dead Those are
fool-hearted tales for fool-hearted
people I only know that which is real
I put my faith in the secret of steel

OLD MAN
Oh I see

Theseus draws his dagger wielding it expertly

OLD MAN (CONT’D)
Well my young friend today fortune
smiles upon you I ama tinker a
wandering worker of metal I know this
secret and can forge you a sword if you
so desire it
THESEUS
I do

OLD MAN
Then it is done I will commission you
such a weapon All I ask in return is
that you feed and house me while I labor
for you

Theseus and his mother share a quick look

THESEUS
(hesitant)
We can house you but the whole
countryside starves We have little food
to offer

OLD MAN

That you offer it is enough It is
settled I will make you a sword one
that I know you will put to good use
But I must say you are wrong to dismiss
the divine young one

EXT OUTSKIRTS OF THE PLATEAU VILLAGE - LATER

A HOPLITE joins KING PETROS a broad shouldered nobleman who
takes note of some BLOOD splatter along a limestone till

HOPLITE
My King the miller says his daughter is
missing

KING PETROS
Rally the others but do it quietly

The hoplite races off as King Petros urges his horse onward
following the blood trail as

EXT VILLAGE FOUNTAIN - NIGHT

Theseus approaches and dunks his bucket into the basin
He notices the water is dark with blood A chill shoots down
his spine as

- he sees a BODY bob up and down in the far end of the
pool He jumps in and rushes over to help when

he sees entrails scattered about in the faint moonlight
He stops and takes in the gruesome scene when

from the corner of his eye he catches the water’s waves
rippling past him -- something is behind him

He SPINS around and sees -- a DEMON -- an Ore like creature --
LEAP OUT AT HIM -- KNOCKING HIM back PLUNGING him into the
water about to kill him when

- the Demon let’s out a guttural cry as KING PETROS drives
his spear into its side --

-- using it like a jousting lance lifting the beast off its
feet driving it out of the basin and onto the ground --

-- when suddenly the demon SNAPS the spear in half and yanks
King Petros off his horse

- sending him crashing downwards King Petros quickly
rises to his feet draws his two swords and goes on the
attack SWINGING with precision --

-- driving one sword after the other into the demon’s upper
torso Venomous black blood spews out as the demon crumbles
to a knee

The King moves to finish him when --

-- the Demon rises in a fit of rage and SMASHES him sending
him hard up against a wall

King Petros tries to get his bearings as the beast charges
in He rips a torch off the wall just as the Demon leaps
onto him -- thrusting it into its face

The demon SHRIEKS wildly stumbles back and races away

King Petros slowly rises to his feet and turns to Theseus
who looks at him in awe

KING PETROS
Are you injured

Theseus shakes his head ‘no’ as several HOPLITES join the
King

KING PETROS (CONTD)
Don’t let him escape (to Theseus) Go
home and stay inside
EXT PLATEAU - CONT

The hoplites chase after the demon but it’s too fast for
them It rounds a corner and disappears

INT HOVEL
Theseus enters rattled

SOPHIA
What happened Are you alright

THESEUS
I’m fine it was nothing

He moves past her and takes a seat on his bed his heart
still racing as

EXT MOUNTAIN SIDE

- the hoplites track the beast’s path to a clearing They
spread out and an eerie quiet sets in when

they find a MAN bloody and wounded slumped up against a
tree

King Petros joins them and takes note of the man’s injuries
they mirror the wounds he inflected on the demon

KING PETROS
Arrest this man

EXT HOVEL - MORNING

Theseus exits as a BELL TOLLS He notices a CROWD gathering
at the village square and races over

EXT VILLAGE SQUARE - CONT

Theseus weaves through the CROWD as a column of hoplites make
their way to a platform where King Petros awaits

In their custody is the MAN they captured the night before
His mouth is bound and he is restrained by heavy chains

KING PETROS
(to the man)
There are demons amongst us and you
stand accused

King Petros pulls a white-hot brand out of a fire
KING PETROS (CONTD)
Let this test of fire reveal your true
nature

The man cowers back as the hoplites pull the chains taut
forcing him to his knees

KING PETROS (CONT’D)
May the gods have mercy

King Petros drives the brand into the mans shoulder The
smell of burning flesh permeates through the crowd as Theseus
looks on

Only the mans MUFFLED CRIES can be heard when suddenly --

-- a terrible SHRIEK erupts from inside him as his gag tears
free

MAN

The pigment of his skin quickly darkens as his back arches
violently and he struggles to stand upright

The hoplites do all they can to restrain him pulling hard on
the chains as the man transforms into --

-- a DEMON

The crowd cowers back with horror as THESEUS stands there
frozen with disbelief

KING PETROS
You spill innocent blood and have no
regard for human life You and your cult
have forsaken man

DEMON
No it is you that has forsaken man for
it is clear that you can be conquered
You will die soon my lord and your
kingdom shall fall

King Petros’ face hardens as he raises his sword

KING PETROS
Let this be an example then

The King STRIKES the demon with his sword gashing open its
neck before finishing him with a backhanded blow

A shocked silence blankets the crowd as Theseus looks on

KING PETROS (CONT’D)

(to the crowd)
I know there are others amongst you demon
in nature who spy upon us Go back to
Arachne go and stand witness to what
youve seen here today For the people
of this realm will fight And for the
wrong you have brought upon us we will
avenge

The CROWD lets out a CHEER
EXT HOVEL - LATER

Theseus approaches the Old Man as he works away on his anvil

THESEUS

You said you know of demons
OLD MAN

I do
THESEUS

How does such a thing exist in a man
How is it possible

The Old Man studies Theseus

OLD MAN
To understand demons you must go back to
the beginning You must know of the
gods

NARRATOR (VO)

And so the old man began to tell Theseus
a tale that had long been forgotten He
told him how the world was born and
how

The Old Man animatedly tells his tale

OLD MAN
in the beginning a ray of light tore
through the chaos and Gods the masters
of light and Titans the family of
darkness were born

WHITE FLASH TO
EXT VIRGIN LANDSCAPE - DAY
Lush green fields with snow capped mountains
OLD MAN (VO)

And the physical world as we know it was

formed Yet this infant realm was

different for it was pure vacant of

ambiguity There was simply good
HERMES the messenger of the gods an eight foot tall
physical specimen races across a field leaving a violent
wake in his path

OLD MAN (VO) (CONTD)
- and evil

Hermes peers down at the TITANS’ dark realm

OLD MAN (VO) (CONTD)
Soon this contrast became conflict
Conflict became war

The Titan HYPERION a dark rendition of Hermes draws from
his quiver and lets loose a volley of arrows

OLD MAN (VO) (CONT’D)
The never-ending struggle had begun

Hermes grins as he eludes each ARROW and in a flash moves
even faster -- BLURRING past the other projectiles

CUT TO

THESEUS listening to the OLD MAN’s story unsure what to make
of it

OLD MAN (CONTD)
For the Titans whose only pursuit were
to devour kill and breed could not help
but attack the Gods

CUT TO

TEASING SHOTS A PHALANX of TITANS led by their king
IAPETUS weave through darkened woods towards Mt Olympus

OLD MAN (VO) (CONT’D)

In turn the gods felt compelled to
vanquish the Titans for they despised
their evil nature

EXT BATTLEFIELD - NEAR MT OLYMPUS

ZEUS leader of the gods hurls BOLTS casting Titans back as
Iapetus charges at him when suddenly --

-- MEDUSA emerges from the phalanx of Titans eyes
shimmering casting GODS to stone

ARIES charges towards her FIRING ARROWS three at a time
STRIKING her across the face blinding her one eye as

the Titan giant CRYPTOS SLAMS down his mallet sending
forward a great fissure causing a land slip along Mt
Olympus

ROCKS rain down but the goddess ATHENA raises her hand stops
them in mid air and slings them at the Titans

CUT TO
The OLD MAN as sincerity fills his eyes
OLD MAN
And soon the earth trembled as the blood
of these so-called “Immortals” spilled
and those incapable of death succumbed to
it
CUT TO

EXT BATTLEFIELD - DAWN

The field runs with blood as a great fog blankets the
battleground

OLD MAN (VO)
Both Gods and Titans fell alike

Slowly reveal various GODS and TITANS frozen in contorted
death poses as the fog slowly dissipates

OLD MAN (VO) (CONT’D)
Still neither side would relent and the
two factions battled on endlessly
incapable of conquering the other

EXT TITAN ENCAMPMENT - A MISTY MOON LIT NIGHT

OLD MAN (VO)
Until one day

The CYCLOPS and the HUNDRED-HANDED ONE stand guard when
SUDDENLY an eagle swoops down and takes refuge nearby

OLD MAN (VO) (CONT’D)
Zeus convinced two of the Titans to
abandon the ranks of darkness and take up
arms with the Gods

In SILHOUETTE the eagle morphs into Zeus The Cyclops and
Hundred-Handed One raise their weapons to STRIKE

-- but Zeus persuades them not to

OLD MAN (VO) (CONT’D)
And with this reason and compromise were
introduced into the world

The Titans lower their weapons and take heed
EXT BATTLEFIELD —- DAY

TEASING SHOTS ZEUS leads the gods’ charge as the Hundred
Handed One launches a volley of spears that rain down on the
Titans

OLD MAN (VO)
Slowly both the war and world began to
change

Enduring heavy casualties the Titans break rank and flee

OLD MAN (VO) (CONT’D)
For the Gods finally defeated the Titans
And those Titans not killed twelve in
total were gathered and exiled to Mount
Tartaros

EXT MT TARTAROS - DAY
A mountain second to only Mt Olympus
OLD MAN (VO)

- where they were imprisoned in a great
hall deep beneath the ground
INT HALL

The twelve Titans clamor against the closing doors but to no

avail as darkness engulfs them
OLD MAN (VO)
And there the Hundred-handed One stood
guard sworn to never let this evil loose
upon the world again
EXT HOVEL

THESEUS
But what of the demons

OLD MAN
Patience my young friend One event
begets another

The Old Man draws a time line across the ground

OLD MAN (CONTD)
Here is the dawn of time

He makes a mark at the beginning

OLD MAN (CONTD)
And here (pointing further down) the war
of the gods It was after this great war
that the gods created “humans” beings
they hoped would be noble virtuous and
pure

EXT ANCIENT GREECE - DAY
PEOPLE move about a thriving city state
OLD MAN (VO)
For three hundred years peace and
tranquility reigned and man lived free
from hardship or disease However as
the ages passed
EXT HOVEL
The Old Man’s wiry finger runs along the time line
OLD MAN
the lingering shadow of darkness that
spawned the Titans began to slowly
reemerge
INT CAVE - DUSK

Mist slowly rolls out as the sun sets

OLD MAN (VO)
- it began poisoning mankind
whispering in its ear twisting the
truth

A MAN stops in his tracks when he comes across the body of a
dead Titan miraculously well preserved

OLD MAN (VO) (CONT’D)
For men were simple creatures easily
swayed and misguided

INT HOVEL
The Old Man talks with disdain

OLD MAN
Soon many men found themselves adrift
And as their malcontent grew they became
bitter and ungodly

EXT VALLEY - DUSK

A group of SAVAGE MEN ambush a TRAVELER stabbing him
repeatedly

OLD MAN (VO)
They ceased to pay tribute to the gods
and heed their tales Some even began to
pledge their allegiance to the Titans

INT CAVE (FROM BEFORE)

The savage men in SILHOUETTE perform an unholy ceremony
around the fallen Titan

OLD MAN (VO)
The most twisted and demented of these
men began to eat of the few remaining
Titans left on Earth And through this
black communion a new family of darkness
arose

A MAN breaks from the ceremony and comes under a shaft of
moonlight He is no longer aman

OLD MAN (VO) (CONTD)
They became demons evil and wicked
creatures that could disguise themselves
like men but were in fact furious
monsters hidden beneath a human veneer

EXT HOVEL

Theseus looks on intrigued

OLD MAN
And so the peaceful dawn of mankind
ended

He points down to the time line

OLD MAN (CONTD)
And that is where we find ourselves
today Fighting an evil with ancient
roots One that many don’t believe
exists But like you when they see a
demon they begin to believe

THESEUS
I’m not sure what to believe

OLD MAN
Last night you called me an old fool
well what are you Nothing more than a
young fool too blind to see that which
is right in front of you

Just then a HORN blares out in the distance
EXT VILLAGE SQUARE - CONT

King Petros and the hoplites form a line of bronze and ride
out of town as VILLAGERS pour out from their homes

KING PETROS
(calling out)
You have all bared witness to an evil
whose numbers grow with each passing day
Let there be no doubt this threat is
real and it must be met But our realm
is vast and the enemy swift

The line’s pace is slow and deliberate as a hoplite BLOWS his
horn again

KING PETROS (CONTD)
I ask all men capable of bearing arms to
campaign with us We will house you
feed you train you All that is
required is the courage to come forward
Now who’s with us Who will help us
track down these fowl beasts

Some begin to heed the King’s call and come forward

KING PETROS (CONTD)
Come take up a weapon and join the line

The hoplites let out a CHEER as each new man falls in
Several more men come forward as the line of bronze grows

longer

He turns to his mother

KING PETROS (CONTD)
And what of the rest of you Who else
will fight to protect the women and
children of this land Who else has
the mettle to stand with us

EXT HOVEL - CONT

HOPLITE ARCHON
How ‘bout it boy are you with us

Theseus looks up at the Hoplite

SOPHIA (0S)
Theseus no

eyes sends a chill down her spine

Theseus decidingly moves past her and into the hovel

THESEUS
pause)
I wish to fight I have toiled here long
enough I’m sorry Mother

INT HOVEL - CONT

where he gathers a few necessities for the long march

ahead

SOPHIA
You mustn’t go Please Theseus It will
be your death

That stops him in his tracks

THESEUS
There is very little I have chosen in
this life But my fate will be my own

SOPHIA
Do you not recall that which I have told
you Your enemies are --

THESEUS
Stop Stop with your tales of
nonsense My enemies are here Mother
And I am tired of being looked down upon
and scoffed at I know in my soul I am
meant to do this

The look of determination in his

Theseus looks at King Petros with deep seated admiration as
the procession approaches

SOPHIA
And I know in mine you are not

Theseus looks at her the scars on her face cut deeply in his
psyche

NARRATOR (VO)
In that moment Theseus realized if he
were to join this crusade his mother
would become vulnerable The village
zealots still cursed her name in the
night and talked of punishing her for her
“ungodly” ways It was only Theseus’
presence that kept them at bay

EXT HOVEL
The hoplite archon approaches the Old Man

HOPLITE ARCHON
What about you friend We could use a
tinker such as you Why not put your
skills to the test and stand with us

OLD MAN
I can only join you if the young master
does For my skills are betrothed to him
for the time being

Just then Theseus emerges from the hovel

THESEUS
(to the hoplite)
I’m sorry I cannot join you

King Petros shoots a look back at them as Theseus bows his
head in shame

OLD MAN
Well it looks like there will be no call
to adventure for us Honor the gods and
fight bravely my friend

HOPLITE ARCHON
Old fool you align yourself with a
coward

The hoplite spurs his horse and charges off as a look of
disgust grows on Theseus’ face

OLD MAN
You have the will to fight yet you stay
Why

THESEUS

What’s it to you old man

Theseus takes off

EXT MOUNTAIN SIDE

- he scales the sharp incline as anger fuels him onwards
EXT MOUNTAIN PEAK - CONT

Theseus pulls himself up where he spots the long bronze
line marching off in the distance their armor glittering in

the setting sun

THESEUS
One day

Just then he notices a RIDER on a BLACK MARE peering down at
the procession

EXT RIDGE
The Rider spurs his horse it rears up and takes off as
EXT VALLEY

» some gravel falls from the ridge King Petros looks up
catching a glimpse of the rider

KING PETROS
Euripides Solon (gesturing) A spy
Follow me

The king EURIPIDES and SOLON take off on their horses
racing up the ridge

EXT RIDGE

The rider spots them and picks up his pace They give chase
as

the rider surges ahead and rounds a bend momentarily
putting himself out of the King’s eye-line

- where he quickly draws his crossbow turns and takes

aim -- FIRING just as King Petros rounds the bend -- turning
right into the oncoming ARROW --

-- he tries to dodge it -- but can’t -- it grazes up against
his shoulder -- tearing flesh -- WHIZZING past him and into
Solon’s chest --

-- casting him off his horse and to his death as he tumbles
down the jagged mountainside

The king hardly has time to react as the rider’s crossbow
rotates and FIRES again --

KING PETROS
Watch out

-- the King and Euripides duck down as -- another ARROW
BLISTERS past them just missing

The rider quickly moves towards an opening in the ridge To
the left lies a steep cliff to the right a forest

KING PETROS (CONTD)
We have to cut him off

The rider starts to bend for the forest but King Petros
quickly draws a crossbow of his own and FIRES --

-- forcing the rider to jerk his mare left -- barely eluding
the ARROW as the King and Euripides fan out and try and
outflank him

- each time the rider bends right King Petros and Euripides
force him left -- towards the cliff

KING PETROS (CONT’D)
He’s ours

The ground in front of them begins to run out as they rapidly
approach the edge

EURIPIDES
My king

KING PETROS
Stay with me

A sly grin crosses the rider’s face as he forces his mare to
LEAP OFF the CLIFF --

-- King Petros pulls HARD on his bridle doing all he can to
stop as does Euripides

The rider sails downwards to his impending doom when
suddenly

- WINGS tucked beneath the horse’s blanket emerge and the
mare shakes off its helmet -- REVEALING it’s not a mare at
all It’s a CHIMERA a winged half-breed

King Petros jumps off his horse long bow in tow taking aim

KING PETROS (CONTD)
Zeus guide my hand

He pulls hard letting loose an ARROW that goes hurtling
through the air

CUT TO

THE RIDER as --

-- the ARROW STRIKES him in the BACK and PIERCES THROUGH HIS
CHEST He slumps over in agony but manages to hold on as the
chimera flies off into the horizon

EXT CAVES OF ARACHNE

The chimera swoops across a barren swamp towards the
caves

EXT CAVE - CONT

landing at the mouth of an entrance as the Rider clings
to life

INT CAVE - CONT

The half-breed weaves through a labyrinth of tunnels until it
reaches a large cavern deep within the cave where

INT CAVERN

the DEMON LORD the man who found the first dead Titan
holds court He is a formidable figure cloaked in dark
armor his BREAST PLATE emblazoned with the mark of the beast
-- ABBADON

RIDER (0S)

(gasping)
My Lord

He hobbles over

RIDER (CONT’D)
King Petros has ordered a decree He
comes for us

The rider collapses to the ground as life leaves him

DEMON LORD
So it begins (to his minions) The
spilling of blood suits us Let King
Petros rise up against us it only
further distracts them from our true
purpose

The Demon Lord calls forward several demons so that they may
hear his council

NARRATOR (VO)
While most men had forsaken the gods and
ceased to recount their tales the demons
instead held true to them

The Demon Lord speaks to his quorum

NARRATOR (CONT’D) (VO)
They had not forgotten the tale of the
twelve titans imprisoned deep beneath the
ground at Mt Tartaros In fact they
knew the legend to be true and in some
sense this was their secret

Two demons break from the quorum and return with a CHEST

NARRATOR (CONTD) (VO)
For it was this knowledge that brought
them comfort in the cold hard years they
idled in the darkness growing in number
and resolve

As the Demon Lord opens the chest a fluorescent glow emanates
out

DEMON LORD
Behold the shards of Iyisis have been
found

The Demon Lord pulls several crystals from the chest and
raises them above his head

DEMON LORD (CONTD)
Bring forth the prisoners

Several hoplites sans their armor are brought forward in
chains and arranged in a single file line

DEMON LORD (CONTD)
Give them back their false courage

The men struggle against their captors as their armor is
clamped into place

DEMON LORD (CONT’D)
And give them their shields as well

The Demon Lord picks up a bow and loads a shard into it

DEMON LORD (CONT’D)
Behold the reward of our labors here
within the caves

The hoplites stand at the ready not knowing what to expect
as

the Demon Lord pulls back on the bow’s chord letting
loose HURTLING the SHARD forward --

-- it PIERCES THROUGH the first HOPLITE’S CAST IRON SHIELD
BRASS CHEST PLATE and BODY with such ease the MAN has a HOLE
in his BACK before he even feels the pain

The same goes for the OTHERS as the SHARD RIPS THROUGH ALL of
THEM and imbeds itself deep within the wall behind them

The hoplites stand there stunned as

the METALLIC PANGS that RANG OUT with each PIERCED SHIELD
ECHO through the cave It’s an eerie moment

» the MEN crumble to the ground one after another as the
HOLES in their CHESTS spew blood and take hold

The demons let out a ROAR

DEMON LORD (CONTD)
(re shards)
We have discovered half the puzzle we
seek Let us find the great bow of
Cronos and complete our task

The demons let out another ROAR

DEMON LORD (CONTD)
Let it be known some of those amongst
the humans must stay behind and die at
the hands of King Petros Let him
believe his crusade is succeeding while
we bide our time and prepare for war

EXT HOVEL - EVENING

Theseus tired and haggard from a long day dejectedly throws
down his nets as the Old Man approaches

OLD MAN
Don’t be daunted my young friend Your
suffering is a gift

THESEUS
A gift

OLD MAN
Yes you should honor the gods for it

THESEUS
I’ve had enough of this “gift” Let the
gods be generous and honor someone else

OLD MAN
Ha How little you know When I look at
you I see taut iron steel I see the
will to fight It is suffering that has
forged that strength in you

THESEUS
And yet I remain here

OLD MAN
Patience my young friend One event
begets another

The Old Man moves to his flume

OLD MAN (CONT’D)
I’ve worked the secret of steal for you

He draws the sword he’s fashioned for Theseus

OLD MAN (CONTD)
I can teach you how to use it if you so
desire

THESEUS
(pause)
Why do you help me

OLD MAN
Young fool don’t ruin a perfectly good
deed by asking Just accept what I
offer

Theseus nods slowly and takes up the sword as
EXT FIELD

King Petros atop his horse charges after a DEMON
DRIVING a lance into its side The beast struggles against

him as

several hoplites storm in further IMPALING the beast
with spears killing it

KING PETROS
We must hurry there will be others
nearby

The column charges ahead As the dust settles and the men
ride off REVEAL

DEMONS emerging from the tall weeds One of the Demons
uses hand signals signing orders to the others They slowly
sink back down and take off as

EXT MOUNTAIN

the Old Man rounds a bend casting his shadow across a
wall of rocks Slowly the shadow begins to transform --

-- as the Old Man becomes a eight foot tall physical
specimen for he is ZEUS disguised

ARIES (0S)
You betray your own bidding oh king of
kings

Surprised Zeus turns to ARIES the GOD OF WAR who emerges
from the forest Their bodies are scarred from battle their
faces hardened by the never ending struggle

ZEUS
Don’t be coy with me Aries

ARIES
I thought we were not to intervene Or
does that not apply to you

ZEUS
I simply said we cannot fight for them
And that I have not done

ARIES
Oh I see I’11 make that distinction
clear to the others

ZEUS
You’11 do no such thing

ARIES
Then allow me to help you

ZEUS
No if man is meant to inherit the earth
they must do so on their own accord

ARIES
Then why do you come to this one’s aide

ZEUS

Because soon the demons will attack and
mankind will need brave men like Theseus
to lead them

EXT CAVES OF ARACHNE - EVENING

The demons from the FIELD cloaked in shadows make their way
to a large cavern where

INT CAVERN - SAME TIME

more and more demons emerge amassing in number as DEMON
BLACKSMITHS distribute armor and weapons They all make
their way to

INT DEMON LORD’S CAVERN
the Demon Lord who addresses them in mass

DEMON LORD
The day we reveal our true strength
approaches my brothers For as our
gathering hastens so does the dawn of our
time Soon all of Greece will tremble
before us

EXT HOVEL

Theseus works up a sweat tracking the Old Man’s blade as he
parryies his strikes

OLD MAN
Never forget what is most important in
battle

The Old Man points to Theseus’s head

OLD MAN (CONTD)
Speed strength numbers can all be
overcome with clear thought and decisive
action Raise your sword I will come
at you with the high guard

They resume their training as the Old Man attacks

NARRATOR (VO)
And so Theseus endured as a terrible fate
befell the rest of Greece

EXT CAVES
The demons CHARGE out a stampeding tidal wave of death

NARRATOR (VO)
For the war of the demons had begun
Like a sheer force of nature they
overwhelmed almost all in their path

EXT THESSALONIKI - DAY

The Demon Lord leads his WAR MACHINE against the WHITE TOWER
of Thessaloniki quickly overtaking the GARRISON of MEN there

NARRATOR (VO)
One by one the city states of Greece
fell

A LONE MESSENGER escapes the siege and races off on his
horse

INT HALL - MT TARTAROS
bringing word to King Petros and his court

MESSENGER
My lord they are pouring out from Asia
Minor across Thrace Up and down the
rivers they come

KING PETROS
How many

MESSENGER
They are at least ten thousand strong my
lord

HOPLITE ARCHON
Ten thousand

The messenger nods as the news weighs heavily on the court
KING PETROS
(to the hoplite archon)
Make haste and spread the word of this
The King dawns his helmet and takes up a sword
KING PETROS (CONTD)
And gather the hoplites For tonight
we ride for war
NARRATOR (VO)
And while this struggle raged Theseus’
village in the far corner of Greece went
untouched until one day
EXT COASTAL RIDGE - MORNING
Theseus now a young man gathers his nets He has grown
into a physical specimen with chiseled features and a body
of wrought iron steel

He hears a RUMBLE in the distance looks up and sees a dust
cloud envelop the village as DEMONS on horseback swarm in

He quickly tosses down his nets and takes off

EXT TRAIL - CONT

Theseus races towards the village as

INT VILLAGE

The Demon Lord leads the charge cutting down MEN and

WOMAN alike The air quickly fills with SHOUTS AGONY and
the SHRILL of CARNAGE

Few MEN fight back as the VILLAGERS flee and run for their
lives

EXT HOVEL

Sophia looks out her window sees the CHAOS and rushes out
as

EXT TRAIL VILLAGE

Theseus sprints into the heart of the bloodbath moving
towards his hovel frantically looking for his mother as

EXT TROTH

- Sophia moves to a wounded BOY leaning up against the
troth VILLAGERS race past them driven by self
preservation unwilling to help

but Sophia grabs hold of the boy and pulls him towards
her hovel as

EXT VILLAGE

a DEMON on horseback charges at Theseus about to strike
when --

-- Theseus rips a spear out of a DEAD VILLAGER rolls forward
and takes the horses legs out -- sending the demon crashing
to the ground

EXT HOVEL

Sophia tends to the boy’s wounds as

the Demon Lord kills at will He spots her and raises
his sword

EXT TROTH

- Theseus’s eyes widen with horror as he sees the Demon
Lord cut down his mother as he races past her

THESEUS
NO

EXT HOVEL

Theseus hurries to his mother’s side and grabs hold of her
She looks up at him as life begins to leave her

THESEUS
No please no

She summons all the strength she has left

SOPHIA
Remember the stone my son

And with that she dies Theseus pulls her in tight
embracing her slowly his grief becomes overrun with anger

INT HOVEL - CONT

Theseus enters grabs his sword from beneath a goat skin and
exits

CUT TO
THESEUS
CHARGING right into the teeth of the demon attack fighting

with a burning vengeance swinging his sword with deadly
accuracy

It’s a sight to behold Demon after demon falls prey to his
deft skill and lethal blade as he searches for the Demon
Lord

When suddenly we pull back faster and faster higher and
higher clouds blur past as we move into the point of view
of

EXT MT OLYMPUS

ZEUS who stands atop a stone colonnade looking down at
the world below along with Aries and HELIOS

Behind them is an Acropolis of stone sitting high atop the
mountain just above the skyline

HELIOS
Who is he

ZEUS
(proudly )
That’s Theseus

Even though the gods are a great distance away they can see
him clearly

HELIOS
He was trained well

ARIES
Yes seemingly by one who knows the ways
of old

Zeus glares at him

ARIES (CONT’D)
You should allow us to stand shoulder to
shoulder with men like this so that we
may rid the world of demons

HELIOS
Man has forsaken us Aries Why should we
go to their aide

ARIES
Because they are merely men they cannot
fight an army of demons

ZEUS
You’re wrong Aries Man can endure all
manners of hardship And they will prove
themselves in this struggle

EXT VILLAGE

The Demon Lord takes note of Theseus’s valiant effort and
charges towards him weaving through the chaos

Theseus spots him from the corner of his eye but acts as if
he doesn’t as the Demon Lord raises his sword about to
strike when --

-- Theseus drops down avoids the blow and SLASHES the Demon
Lord’s leg as he races past him

THESEUS
Stand and fight me coward

Furious the Demon Lord begins to circle Theseus when
suddenly --

-- an ARROW RIPS into Theseus’s thigh The Demon Lord waves
his men off He wants to fight Theseus alone

He dismounts and moves towards him as Theseus rips the arrow
from his leg He hobbles a bit as he squares off against the
Demon Lord who

- attacks unleashing several strikes all deftly blocked
by Theseus but

- it’s clear that the Demon Lord is incredibly powerful as
the blows’ impact ripple through Theseus like a shockwave

Theseus tries to counter but the Demon Lord matches him blow
for blow The exertion of battle and the Demon Lord’s mighty
counter strikes begin to take their toll on Theseus

He feints high and swings low but his injured leg slows him
The Demon Lord takes advantage --

-- BLOCKS the strike and cuts Theseus with three precise
STRIKES across the chest arm and leg

Theseus falls to a knee raises his sword but the Demon Lord
knocks it out of his hands and kicks him hard in the ribs

EXT MT OLYMPUS
Aries goads Zeus as they look on

ARIES
It appears his master failed him

Zeus is furious as
EXT VILLAGE

Theseus coughs up blood and the Demon Lord picks up his
sword

DEMON LORD
Where did you get this blade

Theseus doesn’t answer The Demon Lord SMASHES him across
the face

DEMON LORD (CONTD)
Maybe you didn’t hear me

Theseus remains defiant and doesn’t respond as the Demon Lord
kicks him again before handing the sword to his LIEUTENANT

DEMON LORD (CONTD)
Finish him

The Lieutenant raises the sword about to behead Theseus
when --

-- a bolt of lightening CRACKS through the sky striking the
Lieutenant in the head splitting his skull killing him
instantly

The demons are taken aback as the Demon Lord looks up to the
heavens

DEMON LORD (CONTD)

(pause)
Fate doesn’t smile upon you It worsens
You will instead die slowly in the
galleys Take him away

EXT VILLAGE PATH

Demons clamp shackles onto Theseus and attach him to a long
LINE of MEN they’ve captured

Theseus can hardly stand as he is WHIPPED into motion by a
DEMON He blearily turns back taking one last look at where
his mother fell

EXT MOUNTAIN - DAY

The DEMONS lead Theseus and the men onto a jagged mountain
trail and

EXT DUSTY PLAIN

s across a sun scorched plain where they deny him water
Theseus trudges along barely able to stand from dehydration
yet somehow finds the strength to go on

EXT RIVER BANK —- DAY

Theseus and the men are led onto a demon warship

INT DEMON WARSHIP - CONT

» and down into the galley where two banks of OARSMEN line
the walls Theseus looks on with disdain as they chain him
to an oar

DEMON
Row well and live

Next to Theseus are two men STELLIOS who bares the mark of
a thief and MEGALLOS a big brute of a man who is mute

STELLIOS
(to Demon)
May I use the chamber pot

The DEMON unlocks Stellios and shoves him along He stumbles
forward bumping into another DEMON

STELLIOS (CONTD)
My apologies great sir

Stellios scurries off pocketing the key he just lifted from
the demon as Theseus takes note of his thievery

DEMON COMMANDER
New men know that you only live to serve
this ship Any insolence will be
punishable by death

MEN too ill to go on are pulled from their rows and run
through with swords

DEMON COMMANDER (CONT’D)
As you can see it isn’t wise to test our
mettle

Theseus looks on as Stellios returns to their row

THESEUS
(discretely)
I saw what you did

Stellios gives him a hard look

STELLIOS
Excuse me

THESEUS
If you mean to escape --

STELLIOS
(cutting him off)
Listen friend unless you want your
throat slit I suggest you hold your
tongue

Stellios sallies forth a shiv
THESEUS
It’s only a matter of time before they
discover it’s missing

STELLIOS
Well that’s not your problem now is it

THESEUS
Unchain me and I’1l make it mine

The thief studies Theseus not sure what to make of him

THESEUS (CONTD)
I can create a diversion for you a
ruckus beyond your wildest imagination
For I do not care if I live or die I
only endure so that I may spill the blood
of demons once more

STELLIOS
I don’t doubt you my friend But I
cannot risk the company of a madman

Megallos gestures to Stellios

STELLIOS (CONTD)
I know what I’m doing

Megallos gestures again It’s clear they have a shorthand

STELLIOS (CONTD)
Don’t worry that big oaf (re Demon)
wont realize it’s missing until he
changes guard

Theseus eyes the demon Stellios pickpocketed as he goes to
remove a SICKLY OARSMAN

THESEUS
I think you’re mistaken

Stellios watches the DEMON as he realizes his key is missing

STELLIOS
Damn it

Other DEMONS join him and they begin to look about

DEMON COMMANDER
All of you on your feet

The MEN all stand in attention
DEMON COMMANDER (CONT’D)
A key is missing One of you maggots
must know where it is Speak up or I
will kill you one by one
He waits for a response but no one steps forward suddenly --

-- the Demon Commander SLICES the throat of a MAN standing
next to him He CRUMBLES to the floor spewing blood

DEMON COMMANDER (CONTD)
I told you not to test me

He makes his way up and down the aisle stopping in front of
Megallos about to make him the next victim

Stellios can’t believe it The Demon Commander raises
his sword about to STRIKE when -- Stellios finally steps
forward

DEMON COMMANDER (CONT’D)
Do you have the key

The Demon Commander rips him from his row

STELLIOS
No but I know who does

He throws him to the ground and begins to kick him

DEMON COMMANDER
Speak Or it will be your neck

STELLIOS
It was him

He points to the first man who was cut down

STELLIOS (CONTD)
Ill show you

Stellios pulls on his chain moving to the dead man and with
a slight of hand “removes” the key from the man’s pocket

DEMON COMMANDER
Give it here

The Demon Commander rips the key from his hand and whips
Stellios back to his seat

INT GALLEYS - LATER
Stellios is furious as he tugs at his oar

STELLIOS
(to Megallos)
Of all the men he could have chosen it
had to be you I should’ve let him slit
your fat throat

THESEUS
You did the right thing

STELLIOS
Doing what’s right is of no concern to
me

Stellios refers to Theseus by his oar number

STELLIOS (CONT’D)
Forty-one

THESEUS
My name is Theseus

STELLIOS
Your name doesn’t matter here We’re all
dead men
Megallos gestures to Stellios
STELLIOS (CONTD)
Stop with your gesturing I’m not
talking to you Teach Forty One your
tongue I’ve had enough
EXT RIVER BANK - DIFFERENT DAY

DEMONS disembark the warship like wild marauders and attack a
village scouring through it setting it ablaze

INT GALLEY - SAME TIME
Theseus sees the plumes of smoke rise up through a porthole

THESEUS
Why do they attack these river villages

Stellios isn’t in the mood for conversation so Megallos tries
to explain

THESEUS (CONT’D)
I don’t follow

Megallos tries another gesture

THESEUS (CONTD)
Searching they’re searching for
something

Megallos nods and gestures as if he’s firing a bow

THESEUS (CONT’D)
A bow They’re searching for a bow

Stellios lets out a sigh

STELLIOS
You two are gonna drive me mad The
searching for the bow of Cronos alright
(to Megallos) There I said it for you

THESEUS
The bow of Cronos

STELLIOS
Yeah it’s a legend A myth A fool’s
tale from the third procreation of man

THESEUS
These demons are no fools

Megallos nods in agreement

THESEUS (CONTD)
Why do they seek it

STELLIOS
(reluctant)
They say it is a weapon of great power a
weapon forged by the gods

Theseus looks at him piqued

STELLIOS (CONTD)
This fool (gesturing to Megallos) told me
the story he believes in such things
That’s why the demons cut out his tongue
They didn’t want him speaking their
stories

Theseus turns to Megallos who nods “It’s true”

The thief

THESEUS

Tell me this story
STELLIOS

Itll cost you a day’s ration
THESEUS

I will give you three if I feel it’s

merited

is taken aback

STELLIOS

Your hate for the demons runs deep
THESEUS

Just tell me the story thief
STELLIOS

Fair enough the old ones say the bow

was a gift from the god Helios They say
he gave it to the great King Argos so
that he could rid the world of the evil
of his time But the ancient king
realized that the bow was too powerful a
weapon for any one man to wield So
before he died he hid the bow by a river
unable to return it to the gods
themselves

THESEUS
And now the demons wish to retrieve it

STELLIOS
Yes it’s coveted by their leader

THESEUS
(pause)
Is he the one whose armor bears the mark
of Abbadon

STELLIOS
You’ve crossed paths with him havent
you

THESEUS
Crossed paths and swords

STELLIOS
And you still live That speaks well for
you

THESEUS
And worse for him For I will have my
vengeance I swear it

and an amphora filled with oil

INT GALLEY - SAME TIME

Theseus eyes the amphora as Stellios discretely unlocks their
chains and they quickly spring into action

Megallos throws a demon into a half nelson covering his
mouth as Stellios stabs him with his shiv

Theseus grabs the demon’s sword as the remaining three demons
charge in With unleashed fury he cuts down the first
demon then the second

The third thinks better of it spins back around and goes to
sound the alarm when --

-- Stellios CRACKS a whip wrapping it around the demon’s
neck as it reaches for the alarm bell its hand inches
closer as it pulls Stellios forward when suddenly --

-- the demon stops in his tracks as Megallos grabs hold of
the whip and yanks it hard sending the demon crashing to the
floor where -- Theseus finishes him

Stellios shoots a look up to the deck The demons above are
still oblivious as they continue loading the ship

A chorus of WHISPERS rain out from the men as Theseus tosses
out the keys

Free yourselves

To his surprise they don’t budge as they look at him wide-
eyed with fear

They will kill all of you

undoes his chains and frees three of his fellow countrymen

lights it ablaze

Agreed

The men form a tight fist-like circle as the demons charge
in but Theseus and his men are a sight to behold

-- sails down the side of the mountain gaining speed -- the
rocks behind him blur by as --

-- he BURSTS into the sea -- CUTTING through the water
SLAMMING his fist against the sea floor

RIPPLES scatter out as the tremendous impact transfers to the

Poseidon quickly rises to his feet and SLAPS his hands
together sending --

frantically

into the sea

EXT SEA

Theseus and the men struggle to keep their heads above water
when the Demon Commander spots Theseus as he crests atop a
wave He lunges for him

- but Theseus takes hold of the demon and plunges him
underwater It flails about but Theseus holds fast as the
demon becomes listless and sinks to his doom

Theseus takes hold of Megallos and powers towards the shore

He’s a friend

Theseus turns to the Old Man

OLD MAN
You must go to the stone Theseus

THESEUS
(taken aback)
The stone What do you know of the
stone

The Old Man doesn’t answer him

OLD MAN
Go there and fulfil your destiny

STELLIOS
If we knew our destiny old man we
wouldn’t be stranded here

Theseus gestures to the thief to keep quiet as Heron and
Megallos join them

THESEUS
Stop being coy with me Old Man Explain
yourself

OLD MAN

The time has come for you to know the
name of your father

THESEUS
What do you know of my father

OLD MAN
I know he is a brave King but without
the bow of Cronos he stands no chance
against the demons You must find it and
place it in his hands

STELLIOS
You’re insane Old Man

OLD MAN
Why such trepidation Stellios

The thief is taken aback

44

STELLIOS
How do you know my name

OLD MAN
I know it as I know you bare the mark of
a thief unjustly It was your father

that stole the fatted calf yet you stood
in his place knowing that as a boy they
would show you leniency And so you
began down a troubled path eventually
becoming that which you were accused of

For the first time the veil of cynicism that cloaks the thief
seems undone

OLD MAN (CONTD)
Stand with Theseus help him on this
journey and regain your honor (to
Theseus) You must not fail The Demon
Lord marches for Mt Tartaros

THESEUS
I know I will meet him there and strike
him down

OLD MAN

No you must find the bow first seek the
oracle of Delphi

THESEUS
I don’t understand

OLD MAN
You will Remember one event begets
another my friend Search out the
Oracle

THESEUS
But how will I know who to trust There
are three women who stand before the
alter safeguarding her identity

OLD MAN
Fear not the fates will guide you
But you must make haste you have only
ten days If the resistance at Mt
Tartaros is vanquished the whole of
Greece will be defeated

The Old Man begins to walk away

THESEUS
Old Man don’t go

The Old Man moves behind an enormous deadfall Theseus
chases after him rounding the bend but to his surprise he’s
gone

BEAT
Theseus stands there as the other men look on agape

HERON
It’s a message from the gods

STELLIOS
Nonsense he’s a crazy old sage nothing
more

THESEUS

Youre wrong Stellios That old man is
far from crazy It was he who taught me
the secret of steel

They are all taken aback having seen Theseus’ swordsmanship

THESEUS (CONTD)
(pause)
I will go to the stone and seek the bow
And by the gods I will have my
vengeance Who’s with me

Megallos steps forward and nods

THESEUS (CONTD)
Thank you my friend What about you
Heron Will you and your men join us

The three Cretans all share a look

HERON
We cannot return home for we broke the
law of our people when we were captured
There can only be victory or death for
Cretans We are with you Theseus

CRETAN
For glory and for Greece

All eyes turn to Stellios

THESEUS
How ‘bout it Stellios

STELLIOS

(pause)
The march to Delphi is a perilous one
And now that vast waves of demon patrols
scour the countryside it only worsens
Even if you succeed in slipping past the
demons you still have to cross the great
gorge where many are killed

THESEUS
Tell me something Stellios do you want
to live forever
STELLIOS

No but I will not cast away my life with
careless indifference

THESEUS

Then what of the Old Man’s talk of your
father Is it true

The thief doesn’

t answer

THESEUS (CONTD)

Come to the stone with us You have
nothing to lose and everything to gain

Stellios considers it as he turns to Megallos who gestures
to him “Come on let’s do this”

STELLIOS

Alright (re Megallos) But only
because he talked me into it

INT FOREST

The Old Man rounds a bend and transforms into him

ARIES (0S)

How long will we continue with this
charade

Aries pushes past the thicket and approaches Zeus

ZEUS

I will not let this one be denied his

path

He has the will to fight and the

courage to lead

ARIES

But one man is not enough to turn the

tide

oh King of Kings

ZEUS

We shall see Man has surprised us
before I pray they will tempt the fates
once more and prove you wrong

EXT MOUNTAIN SIDE - DAY

Theseus and the

men move up the mountain

HERON

Do you have a family Stellios

No
mad

STELLIOS
I had a woman once but she drove me
All she did was talk

THESEUS
(to Heron)
And he is a man of few words

Megallos grins
EXT STONE - MOUNTAIN - CONT

The men arrive at the great stone Theseus’ mother brought him
to

Theseus eyes it for a moment before pressing up against it
pushing with all his might Slowly the stone TOPPLES
over

- REVEALING an UNDERGROUND CAVERN

Theseus is taken aback as he enters with the men Armaments
line the walls anything and everything a warrior would
desire

Suddenly Theseus stops in his tracks when he notices a great
sword and a stack of gold coins

He moves to the sword and examines its emblem

STELLIOS
(in awe)
That’s the emblem of the great King
Petros the king who makes the war on
the demons He is the one the Old Man
spoke of

Theseus is flooded with a variety of emotions as he holds the
sword in his hands

NARRATOR (VO)

It was in this moment that Theseus’ heart
became full For as he stood there his
soul ached at the thought of his mother
She was no harlot Yet she endured that
derision for him She sacrificed the
whole of her being so that he could stand
there and behold this sword

HERON
I say to you truly you are a prince

Heron kneels down in front of Theseus as do the others

THESEUS

Rise to your feet men There are no
princes or kings here Fate has
brought us together and now duty beckons
us We must find the bow and defeat the
demons Help yourselves to these
armaments for we will show the world
what the valor of man can bring forth

EXT DEMON ENCAMPMENT - DAY

A HERALD brings word to the Demon Lord who unrolls a
parchment and grins

DEMON LORD
Tell our warships to make for the port of
Mt Tartaros Tell them we will meet
them there in one week’s time where we
will be the hammer to their anvil Now

go

The herald takes off as the Demon Lord clasps a small idol
and a murmur of a DARK WHISPER can be heard in the wind

EXT ARMORY - MT TARTAROS

Hoplites prepare for war distributing weapons to young men
and frightened boys

HOPLITE ARCHON
Have heart men we have no choice but to
stand strong
EXT VILLAGE SQUARE - A WAR TORN MARKET - THESEUS and STELLIOS

Theseus quickly buys horses for the men when Stellios notices
several haggard VILLAGERS eyeing him

STELLIOS
(pause)
Theseus we should hurry
With his back to Stellios

THESEUS
One moment we’re almost done here

The haggard men begin to converge around Stellios he draws
his sword when --

-- a BRUTE OF A MAN SMASHES him from behind sending him hard
to the ground

BRUTISH MAN
I thought that was you

The Man moves to strike Stellios with his sword when
suddenly --

-- Theseus CRACKS him in the ribs with the side of his sword
PUSHING him aside stepping between them

THESEUS
The next one will be with the sharp of
the blade

The Man eyes Theseus as the haggard men surround them

BRUTISH MAN
Step aside I have a blood feud with
this one

THESEUS
What has he done

BRUTISH MAN
He robbed my brother and then cut him
down

Theseus turns to Stellios

STELLIOS
He’s lying I did no such thing

Rage shoots through the man -- he moves to strike Stellios
but Theseus blocks it and with a quick twist of his wrist --

-- expertly brings his sword to the man’s throat spurring
the haggard men to draw their swords

THESEUS
This man rides with me His word is
bond

Just then Megallos and the Cretans storm in

HERON
Drop your weapons or we will end you

The Brutish Man knows they’re out matched as he eyes Stellios
furiously

BRUTISH MAN
May your soul scorch for all eternity

STELLIOS
And may yours know better than to cross
my path again

The Man spits on the ground in front of him before taking off
with his men

Stellios is furious but does his all to conceal it as

a RIDER atop a black steed discretely eyes the emblem
on Theseus’s sword before racing away

EXT MT TARTOROS - DAY
The Rider charges towards the great acropolis entrenched on

top of the mountain sneaking past the demon encampments that
lay siege to the city

EXT BEHIND THE WALLS OF MT TARTOROS

The Rider weaves through the inner ward the fear is palpable
as the impending doom of the demons looms

NARRATOR (VO)
While most men’s hearts grew heavy Lord
Thanos was untroubled For he was
indifferent towards mankind and its
suffering

INT MT TARTOROS COUNCIL CHAMBERS

LORD THANOS who looks vaguely familiar is surrounded by his
many sons as King Petros holds court

KING PETROS
This is where we’ll make our stand

Lord Thanos makes note of the King’s war plan as the Rider
enters

LORD THANOS
My king I fear that isn’t prudent Let
us not be betrayed by false courage
Think of the women and children of this
land To stay here is certain death We
must flee and take refuge in the
mountains

King Petros angrily shoots a look at him
RIDER
(sotto to Lord Thanos)
My Lord I have pressing word

LORD THANOS
Please excuse us

The two discretely move to a room where
INT ROOM - CONT

Lord Thanos closes the door behind him

THANOS
What is it

RIDER
I just bore witness to a man who bears
the sword of King Petros He was of

the appropriate age

THANOS
(pause)
Send word to the Demon Lord let him know
I seek his council

The Rider nods and takes off

NARRATOR (VO)
For Lord Thanos unbeknownst to even his
sons had made the enemy of man an ally
so that he could finally sit on the
throne he long desired

EXT FOREST - DAY

Theseus and his men race out of the forest and approach the
great gorge

STELLIOS
Delphi lies on the other side

HERON
How are we to cross

Suddenly CRIES for help startle them The men draw their
swords and spur their horses onward

EXT GORGE OF DELPHI - CONT

The horses rustle about as the GIANT bends down two great

trees and ties a MAN’S legs to them

HERON
What in the name of

The man begs for his life as the Giant prepares to release

the trees and rip the man apart when --

THESEUS
Stop don’t kill that man

n

The Giant peers down at Theseus as he comes forward

GIANT
Who are you

THESEUS
I am Theseus son of King Petros

GIANT
Theseus son of King Petros move along

Stellios cautiously joins Theseus

STELLIOS
(sotto to Theseus)
He’s right Let’s move on

THESEUS
What has this man done to deserve this

GIANT
He has answered my riddle wrong so he
must pay with his life

THESEUS
Ask me your riddle and if I answer it
correctly spare him and allow us to
cross

The Giant mulls it over for a moment

GIANT
Okay but know this if you answer
incorrectly all of you shall pay with
your lives

STELLIOS
Youre mad I agree to no such wager

Theseus shoots Stellios a look and after a long moment the
thief begrudgingly concedes

THESEUS
We agree to your terms now ask me your
riddle

The men all look on with bated breath as the Giant asks

GIANT
What can run but never walks has a mouth
but never talks has a head but never
weeps has a bed but never sleeps

Theseus thinks struggling with the riddle fear begins
to grow on the men’s faces Stellios slowly reaches for his
sword when --

THESEUS
A river A river runs but never walks
has a mouth but never talks has a head
but never weeps has a bed but never
sleeps

BEAT

GIANT
You are correct young sir

The giant frees the man he was about to kill and lifts a
great log placing it across the gorge

GIANT (CONTD)

When you are ready to return blow the
horn on the other side and I will make
the bridge anew
EXT TREE GORGE

Theseus and his men quickly tie up their horses as the man

they rescued approaches them

MANNIKOS
I wanted to thank you for saving my life
But I must warn you you should not
venture to Delphi The city has been
sacked

THESEUS
Sacked How is that possible

NIKOS
The demons rode in on winged beasts and
rained down death from above They could
not be stopped

THESEUS
What of the oracle Does she still live

That gives Nikos pause

NIKOS
The oracle

THESEUS
Yes we seek her council

STELLIOS
One moment Theseus What business do
you have here friend

The man’s brow furrows with despair

NIKOS
I too was hoping to seek the Oracle

STELLIOS
For what purpose

NIKOS
(pause)
By telling you this I risk much

STELLIOS
By not telling you risk more

NIKOS
Of the three women who stand before the
altar I know which one is the true
Oracle

The men are taken aback

THESEUS
How do you know

NIKOS
Because she is my sister The demons
have taken her captive and are holding
her in the mountain fortress I gathered
a regiment of men in hopes of rescuing
her But the road here from Patras is a
treacherous one I’m the only survivor

The men all share a look as the Old Man’s prophecy comes to
pass

THESEUS
Well we must go save her then It
seems like fate has smiled down upon us
both today my friend

EXT GREAT LOG - CONT

Theseus and his men quickly pull themselves up and make their
way across the great gorge trying not to look down at the
bottomless abyss as

EXT GORGE PLAIN - CONT

they jump off the log and quickly make their way across a
great plain Off in the distance they can see

the city of Delphi as a wind whips past them bringing
with it the smell of death and destruction

EXT DELPHI

Stellios walks next to Theseus out of earshot from the
others as they weave through the carnage of the sacked city

STELLIOS
Theseus there’s something I must tell
you something I couldn’t bring myself to
say before

Theseus turns to him
STELLIOS (CONTD)
The man that confronted us He wasn’t
lying I killed his brother

Theseus is slightly taken aback

STELLIOS (CONTD)
I regret it dearly but I cannot undue
it I thought you should know

Theseus nods when

NIKOS (0S)
There

Nikos points to a fortress that looms over the city from high
atop a mountain The men look up daunted by the towering
hike that lies ahead when suddenly --

-- a SHRIEK overhead startles them They quickly take cover
as a DEMON on a CHIMERA soars up to the mountain fortress

HERON
Do you think we were spotted

Theseus shakes his head ‘no’

THESEUS
But let’s move quickly

They hurriedly make their way up the great mountain
EXT APEX MOUNTAIN FORTRESS - CONT

- and quickly take cover as they eye the fortress entrance

STELLIOS
Remove your armor

HERON
Why

STELLIOS

Because we need to move with the stealth
of a shadow

He shows them the rustling sound the body armor makes when he
moves ever so slightly

HERON
Truly you are a thief

EXT FORTRESS ENTRANCE - CONT

Theseus and the men slip past DEMON CENTURIES and make their
way inside

INT CORRIDOR

- where they discretely check the various bastilles as
DEMONS lurk about

NIKOS
(hushed tone)
She must be in the dungeon down below
The GRUMBLING of DEMONS gives them pause

THESEUS
Alright let’s go but be ready

They move forward when suddenly --

-- STYMPHALIN BIRDS EXPLODE into the corridor -- WHIPPING
past them -- A FLUTTERING STREAM OF BLACKNESS

The Cretans are taken aback as they all quickly press up
against the walls

STELLIOS
Stymphalin birds murderous fiends that
heed the will of the demons Thank the

gods they don’t have our scent

They wait for the corridor to clear before quickly making
their way down a flight of stairs to

THE DUNGEON

They slowly round a corner and see two DEMONS standing guard
They spring into action quickly cutting them down

INT DUNGEON
before entering and spotting a WOMAN shackled in chains

NIKOS
That’s her

Theseus races over to the Oracle taken aback by her beauty

ORACLE
I knew you would come

He looks at her curiously

ORACLE (CONTD)
You gave me hope when I had none

He quickly frees her from her chains when just then --

-- DEMONS storm in Stellios launches a volley at them --
ARROWS ZIP through the air finding their marks as

Theseus grabs hold of the Oracle and quickly rejoins the
men

THESEUS
Move

They charge forward right into the DEMON THRONG carving a
path through the FORAY and up the stairs

INT CORRIDOR

Suddenly they see a horde of DEMONS quickly making their way
towards them

The men all look to Theseus

THESEUS
Do as she says Go

The men follow the Oracle as she leads them down a

PASSAGEWAY

they race along passing through two great doors when Theseus
stops turns back goes to slam the doors shut when --

-- a pursuing demon SLAMS up against them pushing Theseus
back The men rush over to help Theseus as MORE DEMONS pile
up against the doors forcing them ajar

Stellios quickly takes aim careful not to hit the men

-- ARROWS ZIP through the crack of the doors STRIKING a
DEMON between the eyes ANOTHER in the chest tipping the
scales in the men’s favor allowing them --

-- to SLAM the doors shut and slide the CRASH BAR into place

sprint after them but to no avail

suddenly his face deadens as

Theseus’s chariot fishtails around a turn careening near the
edge The Oracle holds him tightly as she looks down the
jagged mountainside

ON STELLIOS

he races along the narrow path when suddenly --

-- a DEMON on a CHIMERA swoops down at him He quickly
ducks barely avoiding the winged half-breeds strike as --

side of the mountain

ON THESEUS

he sees the Cretan tumble to his death as the Chimera Rider
soars up and banks around

The men continue to race down the side of the mountain as the
demon charioteers move within striking distance

Theseus hands the reins to the Oracle turns back and
LAUNCHES a volley of ARROWS at the DEMON CHARIOTEER leading

the forehead jerking his head back hurtling him off the
chariot SMACK into --

control and FLIPS his chariot setting off --

DEMON CHARIOTEER SMASHING into ANOTHER while OTHERS CAREEN
off the PILE UP TOPPLING OFF the MOUNTAINSIDE

ON THESEUS

he quickly takes back the reins and charges ahead when he
sees

THE CHIMERA RIDER glide up alongside the men draw his
crossbow and FIRE --

-- an ARROW PANGS against Stellios’s shield as he deflects it
at the last moment

STELLIOS
Fowl bastard

ANOTHER ARROW grazes MEGALLOS -- tearing his shoulder He
loses control of his CHARIOT as --

-- it CAREENS against the MOUNTAIN and RICOCHETS off
lurching in front of STELLIOS who almost SLAMS into it

Whoa

THESEUS quickly draws his bow and fires ARROWS at the CHIMERA
RIDER driving him away as

MEGALLOS and STELLIOS somehow manage to steady their
steeds and avoid disaster

The road widens again as the men race down a steep
straightaway going faster and faster bolting into

the Chimera Rider looms overhead as the men charge
forward and the gorge comes into view

he can almost hear the Demon Charioteers RUMBLE behind him as
he races towards the gorge

ON STELLIOS
he whips his reins when suddenly --

-- the chimera swoops down again about to strike Heron but
this time the THIEF is ready for him --

-- he CRACKS his WHIP WRAPS it round the chimera’s front leg
and yanks with all his might wrenching the chimera down as --

-- Megallos quickly pulls up next to it and STRIKES the
winged half-breed with a mighty blow It topples to the
ground and CRUSHES the RIDER as it WHIPS into a TRUNDLE --
BARRELLING towards --

-- THESEUS and THE ORACLE

THESEUS
Hold on

Theseus’s chariot hits the chimera in full stride the impact
knocks the Oracle off her feet as --

-- the chariot goes up and over the winged creature --

-- flinging the Oracle backwards She reels off the chariot
but Theseus quickly snatches her and pulls her back in

She looks at him appreciatively as
EXT PLAIN GORGE

they make their way to the gorge and fishtail to a stop
Theseus grabs the HORN and blows it

It ECHOES through the great gorge and sure enough goads the
Giant forth

Everyone looks on with bated breath as the Giant lumbers over
to the great log while the RUMBLING behind them grows LOUDER
and LOUDER Stellios can’t believe it

STELLIOS
Come on Come on

EXT GORGE

The Giant lifts the great log and swings it towards the gorge
as the demon charioteers move in faster and faster

Stellios draws his bow and fires ARROWS at the demons as the
log drops down with a great THUD

him back as they all manage to make their way through the
chaos and crash to the ground

To their surprise the Giant bends down picks up the log and
begins to lift it as they take refuge underneath a ledge

The Demons’ eyes go wide with fear as the Giant raises the

log Many lose their footing and fall into the bottomless
abyss while others hang on for dear life as

the Giant shakes the log sending the last remaining

Ah damn it

Stellios pulls away
STELLIOS (CONTD)
How the hell do you do it

HERON
(grinning)
You just have to convince yourself it
doesn’t hurt

ON THESEUS

He notices the Oracle sitting in a clearing nearby looking

out at nothing when Nikos approaches

NIKOS
Tread lightly for she’s been through a
terrible ordeal The demons tortured
her but she refused to succumb to their

will
Theseus nods as Heron moves to Nikos
HERON
How ‘bout it friend that’s quite a cut
you have there
NIKOS
Where I come from we suture our wounds
we don’t brand yourselves like cattle

Heron steps forward

crashes to the ground

Theseus makes his way over to the Oracle He’s not sure what

to say when

There’s no need to thank me

Yes there is such bravery always merits
gratitude

Theseus looks at her piqued as he wonders
ORACLE (CONTD)
You need not worry I’m fine

He’s taken aback

THESEUS
Can you read a man’s thoughts

ORACLE
Not all of them just the ones I’m
afforded

THESEUS
And which are those

ORACLE
The ones the fates decide to give me
And that same providence behoves me to
tell you this You must go to
Monovoshia There you will find the bow
hidden by a river

Theseus is taken aback

She turns

ORACLE (CONT’D)
What gives you pause

THESEUS
Monovoshia is a three day journey from
here If you are mistaken there will be
no recourse

ORACLE
Fear not Theseus I am sure For long
ago the order of oracles was entrusted
with this secret sworn to protect it
until the day came when man would need
the bow once more

and looks at him

ORACLE (CONT’D)
Only then was it meant to be revealed to
the man it was destined for

THESEUS
(pause)
What makes you think I’m that man

She smiles at him confidently

ORACLE
Well aren’t you

THESEUS
All I know is that I seek vengeance
against the demons

She looks at him slightly taken aback -- that was not the
response she expected

thicket

NIKOS
I am here Theseus

THESEUS
You said you were from Patras Is that
not the closest port

NIKOS
It is

Theseus nods as he sees the Oracle approach

THESEUS
Gather ‘round men (to Oracle) They’re
all yours

ORACLE

Before you all forge ahead know this
In order for you to succeed in this
quest to find the bow and win this war
all of you but one must die

They’re all taken aback

ORACLE (CONTD)
Only with this sacrifice can you succeed

THESEUS
Are you sure
ORACLE
Yes Are not two of the seven that set
out on this journey already dead

They don’t have to answer as they think of the dead Cretans

ORACLE (CONT’D)
Four more must fall

STELLIOS
Do you know which one of us will live

ORACLE

No But know this

if at any point you

decide to turn back your fates will be

recast and you will be spared

Her words hang heavily

in the air

THESEUS
I don’t believe one’s fate can be cast
A man’s life is what he makes it But
there are greater forces at work here
That I cannot deny

Theseus shoots them all a look

THESEUS (CONTD)
But there are worse fates than death
We mustn’t shy away from this my friends
For this struggle is greater than all of

us

It is not hate that drives me

Then what is it Vengeance

THESEUS
It’s more than just vengeance

He looks at her for a moment

THESEUS (CONTD)
A sage old man once told me that if you
were to die bravely in this world Hades
would award you the Elysian Fields a
vast paradise for the blessed dead When
I was young I didn’t believe in such
things but life has shown me the truth of
this old man’s wisdom

She looks at him curiously

THESEUS (CONTD)
I only pray that with all the world’s
evil gathered against us I too can die
bravely so that I may see my mother once
more and thank her for her great
sacrifice And if the fates allow me
to strike down my enemies as I make my
way to this end so be it

Theseus cuts through the foliage slowly revealing an
emblem etched in stone Megallos gestures to Stellios

the brick before taking out his dagger and prying it loose

discovering an inscription on the back of the brick

Stand ready at the golden hour and look
upon the gods’ great flower there you
must go for it leads to the mighty bow
They are all taken aback as they mull over the riddle

ORACLE
The god’s great flower is the carnation

Theseus looks up at the sun as it nears the horizon

THESEUS
And the golden hour approaches

EXT MOUNTAIN TOP - MONOVOSHIA

They scour the landscape for the flower but to no avail

They begin to lose heart as the sun sets and a golden light
fills the sky when suddenly --

EXT RIVER

-- a fierce low tide rapidly draws the waters of the river
out to sea leaving the riverbed dry

BACK ON MEN

They look down in awe as a SHEPHERD crosses the riverbed
weaving past several waterholes

THESEUS
(pause)
Look there
Theseus points to a waterhole

THESEUS (CONTD)
What does that look like

They all eye it for a moment

ORACLE
It’s shaped like the gods’ flower

THESEUS
Hidden out in the open

EXT RIVERBED

Theseus kneels down next to the waterhole and cups some water
with his hand bringing it to his mouth

THESEUS
This water is not from the sea

Theseus unstraps his cuirass
THESEUS (CONTD)
It’s probably a fresh water spring from

one of the mountains nearby

HERON
Can we swim it or do we die trying

THESEUS
No need for all of us to risk our lives
Ill go it alone
The Oracle steps forward

ORACLE
Id like to come with you

THESEUS
No stay here

Concern fills her face

ORACLE
Then take this

She ties her dagger around his waist

ORACLE (CONTD)
And be careful

THESEUS
Don’t worry I’ve come too far to die
here
INT WATER SPRING

Theseus PLUNGES through the surface and pulls himself along
with powerful stokes as

the spring narrows and the light behind him fades He
moves along deeper and deeper into

the darkness that lies ahead doing his all to stay calm
as he feels his way along the walls of the narrow downward
arching spring

His face begins to turn blue as he forges ahead only now
reaching the lowest point of the spring

He quickly pushes off the nadir and ascends rapidly making
his way up the other half of the arching spring

- oxygen all but gone now as he moves faster and faster
light barely visible above as --

-- he bursts through the surface gasping for air right in
the middle of an

UNDERGROUND LAKE DEEP WITHIN THE MOUNTAIN

Theseus fills his burning lungs as he slowly makes his way to
the shore rising out of the water when

a FERAL GROWL makes his hairs go on end He slowly turns
towards a dark tunnel as

beastly eyes come into view sizing him up Theseus
draws his sword just as the CAVERN BEAST leaps out at him --

-- closing the ground between them in an instant attacking
Theseus with a tenacity unlike any he’s ever come across

Theseus wields his sword expertly deflecting the onslaught
as best he can when --

-- the cavern beast connects with a BLOW sending him hard to
the ground

The beast storms in as Theseus rises to his feet dodges the
beast’s charge and goes on the attack SWINGING with
precision --

-- But the beast doesn’t relent as it charges in again --

-- Theseus side-steps it and is about to strike when he
loses his footing on the slick algae that blankets the cavern
floor CRASHING down hard as --

-- the beast pounces on him knocking the sword from his hand
and striking him across the chest

Blood spews as Theseus tries to get his bearings when
suddenly --

-- the beast goes for the kill striking out at his jugular
just as --

-- Theseus rips the dagger from his waist and slams it in the
underside of the beast’s jaw pushing it through its head and
out its skull

The cavern beast topples over and dies as Theseus slowly
rises eyeing the Oracle’s dagger

EXT RIVERBED

The Oracle and men wait impatiently when they notice the
water flowing back into the riverbed as the tide rises

STELLIOS
Damn it Heron come on we have to go
in after him
Heron doesn’t budge as Stellios quickly unstraps his cuirass

STELLIOS (CONTD)
What’s a matter

HERON
I cant do it
STELLIOS
Why not
HERON
I just can’t
STELLIOS
Heron --
HERON
No I cannot bare narrow passages I’m
SOrry

Stellios begins to laugh

STELLIOS
Narrow passages We’ll drown before your
fear does us in Come on
Heron begrudgingly unstraps his cuirass as
INT UNDERGROUND LAKE

Theseus hurriedly scours the cavern and there in the
dark depths he finds the Great bow of Cronos

He picks it up and sees it is truly a work of the gods for a
stream of lightening forms a cord and BUZZES with
electricity

THESEUS
By the gods

He pulls on the “cord” and a bolt of lightening forms

He lets loose HURTLING the BOLT forward It STRIKES a wall
SCORCHING the STONE EXPLODING into a mushroom cloud of
sparks illuminating the entire cavern

EXT RIVERBED

Stellios prepares to dive into the waterhole as the tide
rises faster and faster around them when just then --

-- Theseus emerges triumphantly with the bow

STELLIOS
Is that it

Theseus nods Relief crosses their faces as the Oracle eyes
Theseus’ wound

THESEUS
(off look)
I’m fine

They quickly move to flee when --

-- DEMONS pour out from the forest tens hundreds an
entire LEGION

The men form a defensive circle swords poised when --

-- they see the great power of the bow as Theseus unleashes a
BOLT -- striking a DEMON PHALANX hurtling a row of demons
back with a single BLAST

STELLIOS
By the gods

FEAR spreads through the demon rank and file as a volley of
BOLTS SLAM into them -- charring them alive as the tide
RUMBLES in behind them

Theseus continues to FIRE AWAY when suddenly --

-- a vast torrent rushes in like water released from a dam
The deluge SLAMS into the DEMONS and MEN sweeping them away

INT DELUGE - CONT

Theseus is throw into a swirl tumbling head over heels --
SLAMMING up against a rock The bow slips out of his hand

EXT RIVER BANK - A LITTLE LATER

Theseus washes ashore and slowly comes to awoken by the BUZZ
of the bow He looks up and sees

a DEMON aiming it at him

DEMON
You wield the power of the gods but you
are not a god You are only a man

The Oracle who has washed up nearby with the others cries
out as the Demon pulls back the cord about to strike Theseus
dead when suddenly --

-- the demon is SMASHED by the great HAMMER of ARIES the God
of War

The DEMONS cower back as ARIES an EIGHT FOOT TALL WARRIOR
swings his hammer casting demons through the air

The men look on with disbelief as Aries bends down picks up
the bow and TOSSES it to Theseus

ARIES
(to the stunned men)
MOVE

Together they plow down demons as Theseus fires the bow and
Aries continues to dispatches demons

Megallos gestures to the thief

STELLIOS
Yes I believe you now

The Oracle and others race behind Aries and Theseus as they
quickly escape into the forest

INT FOREST - CONT

They make their way to a clearing where Athena waits with
ETRUSCAN HORSES

ARIES

(to Theseus )
Hurry

(MORE)

ARIES (CONTD)
You must get the bow to your father
The great battle of this time begins

They quickly move to the horses as Athena whispers in the
lead horse’s ear

ATHENA
(to Theseus )
These horses will make the three day
journey in half the time You need not
give them rest They will ride to their
death

THESEUS
We are indebted to you

ATHENA
And we to you Gods’ speed Theseus

He nods as they quickly ride off
EXT MT TARTAROS - DAY

LEGIONS of DEMONS position GREAT SIEGE TOWERS and CATAPULTS
as the demon warships ready themselves along the shore

EXT PASTURE - ON HORSEBACK - MOVING

Beads of sweat form on Theseus’s face as his wound becomes
infected but he fights through the pain as he leads the
men past war torn hills

EXT HINTERLAND - ON HORSEBACK - MOVING - NEXT DAY

The Oracle takes note as Theseus’s infection worsens he
struggles to keep his eyes open as he burns with fever

ORACLE
We need to stop

THESEUS
No we must push on

EXT RIDGE - EVENING

Finally Theseus pulls his horse to a halt as a vast demon
encampment comes into view in the valley below

STELLIOS
(taken aback)
They must be ten thousand strong

THESEUS
We can’t risk crossing now We must wait
for the cover of night

The men wearily dismount as the Oracle approaches Theseus

ORACLE
I must tend to your wound

He looks at her for a moment

ORACLE (CONTD)
I wasn’t asking

EXT FIELD - A LITTLE LATER

Theseus leans up against a tree as the Oracle approaches with
a kylix filled with herbs

ORACLE
Here drink this it’ll help ease your
affliction

He can’t help but be taken by her as she tends to his wound
She looks up at him and he turns away

- But it’s no use she knows how he feels She smiles
graciously

ON THE MEN
They make preparations for a quick rest

NIKOS
I don’t sleep much I’11 stand guard

The men nod appreciatively as Stellios moves towards Theseus
He can’t help but eye the bow

Theseus feels his stare He exchanges a look with the thief
and pulls the bow in tight

ON MEGALLOS
he prays spurring on Heron to do the same

HERON
Ancestors have mercy upon me and bring
me your solace and wisdom for I seek
your guidance Help me honor you as I
try to live with the grace youve
bestowed upon me

ON THESEUS AND THE ORACLE
She continues mending his wound

THESEUS
So how does one become an oracle

ORACLE
You don’t become an oracle you’re born
that way whether you like it or not

THESEUS
You say it as if it’s a curse

ORACLE
It’s a curse and a blessing

THESEUS
All gifts are

He sees pain in her eyes as she turns away from him He gets
up and moves closer to her

THESEUS (CONTD)
What is it
ORACLE
(pause)
Of all the visions I’ve had this one is
the most difficult to bear

Theseus follows her eye-line and sees Nikos standing
guard a little ways off

THESEUS
I can’t imagine what it must feel like to
know that your brother may die
She turns to him

ORACLE
It wasn’t my brother I was thinking of

Theseus looks at her for a moment before he moves in and
kisses her

EXT FOREST - NEAR MT OLYMPUS

Aries and Athena race back when suddenly they come upon
Helios and DIONYSUS

HELIOS
This time you’ve gone too far

Aries looks away with disdain as he pushes past them

DIONYSUS
You were wrong to intervene so boldly
Aries

ARIES

Were we Do you have the gift of

foresight (to Helios) Do you
ZEUS (0S)

No But you betrayed my bidding

nonetheless

They all turn to Zeus who emerges from the forest

ARIES
You most of all should agree

ZEUS
We cannot fight for them

ATHENA
But an evil looms my lord something far
greater than the whisper that leads the
demons I know not what it is but I can
sense it

ZEUS

(pause)
I know what you speak of I feel it too
It is the lingering shadow of the Titans
Iapetus their leader calls out to them
from his prison But we need not fear
for behind the great doors he shall
remain (pause) And if the courage of man
fails if the freedom we’ve given them
goes astray we’ll wash them all from the
face of the Earth

EXT RIDGE - LATER

Nikos stands silent only the murmur of the wind can be
heard as he eyes everyone making sure they’re asleep

He deftly moves to Theseus and pulls the bow from his arms
Sheer thrill fills him as he slips away when suddenly --

-- a WHIP CRACKS His eyes widen with fear as the whip rips
the bow from his hand

STELLIOS
Going somewhere with that friend

Nikos seethes with anger as Stellios flips himself the bow

STELLIOS (CONT’D)
As fate would have it I don’t sleep much
either

From the corner of his eye Nikos sees the others come to

NIKOS
Help Theseus

THESEUS
What’s going on

NIKOS
He tried to steal the bow
STELLIOS
I did no such thing He’s the one who
tried to steal it

The others join them and take in the scene

NIKOS
Don’t listen to him Theseus he’s a liar
and a thief

STELLIOS
Watch your tongue or I will end you

They are at a standstill as Theseus eyes both of them

THESEUS
Give me the bow Stellios

Stellios looks at him with disbelief

STELLIOS
Do you not trust me After all we’ve
been through

THESEUS
I do but give it to me

NIKOS
I’m telling you he tried to steal it

Stellios shoots Nikos a look

STELLIOS
I should kill you

He raise the bow and takes aim

THESEUS
Stellios no

An uneasy pause as Stellios lowers the bow

STELLIOS
Something just occurred to me It’s been
troubling me for some time now

They all eye him carefully

STELLIOS (CONTD)

How was it that the demons were upon us
so quickly after we discovered the bow
It was almost as if they were waiting for
us

(beat)
Maybe they were maybe someone led them
to us But who We all hate the demons
Weve all felt the crack of their whip
All of us except him
Stellios gestures to Nikos as the others turn to him
STELLIOS (CONTD)
Ever notice how our friend here always
trails behind Maybe he’s signaling to
them or marking our path
NIKOS
I’ve done no such thing He’s just
trying to save himself
Theseus begins to stare at Nikos
STELLIOS
Am I Then answer me this friend do
you bear the mark of fire
He doesn’t have to answer

STELLIOS (CONTD)
I think he’s one of them

Stellios hands the bow to Theseus
THESEUS
(pause)
There’s only one way to find out

Megallos moves to grab Nikos as he cowers back

NIKOS
He’s lying You mustn’t believe him

Theseus lowers his sword into the fire
NIKOS (CONTD)
Please Theseus You’re making a big
mistake Despina
Theseus turns to the Oracle who stands there torn
THESEUS
I’m sorry (to Nikos) Let this test of
fire reveal your true nature

The Oracle grimaces as Nikos cowers back

THESEUS (CONT’D)
May the gods have mercy

Theseus moves to press the sword onto Niko’s shoulder

his back violently hurtling Megallos through the air

DEMON lashing out at them with fury

when --

-- a terrible SHRIEK erupts from inside Nikos as he arches

The men scramble to restrain him as he transforms into a

Theseus goes to strike when --

-- a DAGGER WHIZZES past him in a VIOLENT TWIRL - STRIKING

Theseus turns to see who cast the death blow and finds the
Oracle standing there breathing heavily keeping emotions
bay

ORACLE
He’s no longer my brother

She turns and walks away
EXT RIDGE - MOMENTS LATER

Theseus approaches the Oracle Without looking at him

ORACLE
I knew it in my heart I did But for
the death of me I did not want to believe
it

He was lost to you long before this

The oracle and the men are quickly surrounded

THESEUS
My name is Theseus

He draws his sword SPURRING the Hoplites into action they
thrust their spears towards them when

- the Hoplite leader gets a better look at Theseus’ sword

HOPLITE LEADER
Stand down men stand down

Recognition quickly crosses the hoplites’ faces as Theseus
holds the sword aloft

HOPLITE LEADER (CONT’D)
How did you come to possess the sword of
Mt Tartaros

THESEUS
It was given to me by my father I am
the son of King Petros

HOPLITE LEADER
Blasphemy The King has no son Arrest

The hoplites bring their spears to the men’s throats
THESEUS
Easy (to Hoplite Leader) All I ask is
that you bring me before the King

The hoplites are all taken aback

KING PETROS
I often prayed that the gods would look
over you fearing I had failed you with
my judgement But now you have returned
to take up your rightful place And you
return not just a man but as a great
hero

Theseus appreciatively places the bow in his father’s hands

KING PETROS (CONTD)
(looking at it in awe then)
You have become more than I could ever
hope my son And what of your mother

THESEUS
(pause)
She fell at the hands of the Demon Lord

The two men stand there solemnly for a moment
KING PETROS

Let us pay tribute to her Let us avenge
her sacrifice

To the MEN manning the WALLS

cloaked in a disguise of poverty has

The King is hesitant

Theseus nods uneasily and rushes over to his father as

into the courtyard

EXT WALLS - CONT

The King and Theseus quickly make their way up a ladder

ON LORD THANOS

He shoots a look to the tower where the Dark Figure stands
ON DARK FIGURE

He lays a piece of King Petros’ chainmail on an AVIARY
before undoing its latch unleashing a flock of STYMPHALIN

The ravenous black FOWLS swoop down towards King Petros as he
ascends the ladder ATTACKING him with wicked ferocity

THESEUS
Father

Theseus tries to fend off the clawing creatures when

« amongst the chaos one of Lord Thanos’ SONS SLAMS an
oxcart into the ladder --

-- TOPPLING IT OVER hurtling the King and Theseus downwards
where they CRASH with a THUD

King Petros blearily looks up as Lord Thanos rips the bow
from his hand and takes off

KING PETROS
NO

Just then the Dark Figure SWOOPS down on a CHIMERA and grabs
hold of Lord Thanos WHISKING him into the air

Stop him

King Petros and Theseus rush up the wall as PANIC shoots
through the city

HOPLITE ARCHON
My lord we must flee We cannot hold
the city

The King eyes the VILLAGERS as they race about with fear

KING PETROS
Take the women and children to the rear
sanctuary and start evacuating the city
Well hold them as long as we can

The hoplite archon nods and rushes off

THESEUS
Father it is true we cannot defeat the
demons with the strength of arms Not in
a full fledged battle not against an
advance like this But there is a great
equalizer in this struggle

KING PETROS
What are you suggesting

THESEUS
We attack We charge out and try and
take back the bow

Just then another EXPLOSION goes off as a TOWER along the
walls crumbles raining down mortar and stone

THESEUS (CONT’D)
The longer we wait the more the power of
the bow will weaken our defenses

The King thinks solemnly

THESEUS (CONTD)
If we lead our forces into the heart of
the demon line I will cut down the one
wielding the bow

KING PETROS
And with it we beat back the others

THESEUS
Exactly They will never expect such an
attack

KING PETROS
(pause)
We have no choice Gather the hoplites
Gather them and all the others willing to
charge

Theseus nods and takes off as

the Demon Lord focuses the thrust of his attack on the

impregnable defenses

Theseus takes his place alongside his father who addresses
the men one last time as the demon war machine closes in

KING PETROS
Tonight we charge across open terrain
into the jaws of Death into the mouth of
Hell Many of us will fall Many of
us will not live through the night
And for such bravery the entire world
gives thanks For our charge will go
down in the annals of time as the charge
that righted man’s path It will be
the sacrifice that turns the tide of our
time And our valor will be legend for
we shall pass through the jaws of death
and escape the mouth of hell

The men let out a CHEER as they are emboldened by the King

KING PETROS (CONTD)

The men of old used to cry out “Aera” as
they charged into battle For so badly
did they wish to meet their enemies they
would call out to the gods to raise the
winds and carry them forward Tonight we
invoke that same spirit Tonight I say
“Rerall”

Aerall

The men raise their swords as King Petros leads them past the
great walls

THESEUS STELLIOS
Aera Aera

ON THE DEMON LORD
He is momentarily taken back as

the KING and THESEUS valiantly charge forward leading
the men onwards before

HE begins to let loose from the bow

ON THE CHARGING MEN

BOLTS CRASH into them throwing them about killing them in
scores but King Petros urges them onwards

KING PETROS (CONT’D)
Come on men Forward

MORE and MORE MEN meet their end but THESEUS charges ahead
SMASHING into the demon line as he CUTS down demons all the
while eyeing

the DEMON LORD who fires relentlessly killing with
ease but this act of attrition begins to take hold as the
men surge forward

THESEUS
Come on men Aera

The Demon Lord eyes the surge uneasily and begins to fire on
his own rank and file as they tangle with Theseus and the
others

The CARNAGE MOUNTS but KING PETROS and THESEUS continue to
fight their way forward sheer will driving them as they cut
down demon after demon when --

-- the Demon Lord fires a BOLT inadvertently clearing a
path Theseus and the King take advantage and charge into
it

in an instant they can see the Demon Lord launching
volleys as they charge ahead

KING PETROS
Aera

The path begins to collapse in on them as
TIME SLOWS

and KING PETROS moves to SLING his sword at the Demon Lord
when the Demon Lord spots him takes aim and FIRES

Theseus eyes go wide as he tries to push his father out of
the way -- but to no avail

They sail through the air and crash to the ground

The MEN eye their fallen leaders with grave concern Slowly
the MOMENTUM of the charge begins to shift as men begin to
lose their mettle

They start to fall back as the DEATH TOLL mounts and the
sheer number of demons overwhelm them

ON THESEUS as he comes to He turns and looks for his
father who lies on the ground nearby

He rushes to his side and takes in the carnage

THESEUS (CONT’D)
Father

Life begins to leave the king as he takes hold of Theseus’
hand

KING PETROS
Theseus

He fights through the pain struggling
KING PETROS (CONTD)
(pause)
Fight until the last gasp my son
Theseus is still for a moment as the king dies

BEAT

He rises to his feet his bloodlust growing as he scours the
battlefield for the Demon Lord

EXT WALLS

A BOLT SMASHES the great wall as the Demon Lord leads his
forces into

EXT COURTYARD

-- the INNER WARD of the courtyard

EXT WALLS

Theseus spots him and gives chase fighting his way towards
him

EXT COURTYARD - SAME TIME
- but to his surprise the Demon Lord doesn’t attack the
Acropolis instead he turns the bow towards the mountain
FIRING relentlessly breaking through to a cavern

CUT TO
MOUNT OLYMPUS

The gods who watch from atop their stone colonnade stand at
attention

ARIES
The Titans

No

Concern crosses their faces

Fear not even with the bow the demons
will not be able to get past the hundred
handed beast
Aries looks at Zeus unsure and takes up his hammer as

the Demon Lord and his minions charge ahead where they
discover --

-- THE HUNDRED HANDED BEAST breathing heavy ever ready at
his post

EXT COURTYARD - SAME TIME

Stellios and Heron fall back and try to form a new line as
the DEMONS swarm into the courtyard

STELLIOS
Rally

HERON
Come on men Stand and fight

Stellios spots Theseus cutting down demons racing into the
cavern as

INT CAVERN

the Demon Lord fires BOLTS at the Hundred Handed Beast --
-- but the Hundred Handed Beast deflects the BLASTS with the
many shields he wields and SMASHES the demons that charge at
him
EXT CAVERN

Stellios rallies the men as they assemble around him

STELLIOS
Hold the line

He then quickly gestures to Heron Megallos and a platoon of
HOPLITES

STELLIOS (CONTD)
Follow me

They race towards the cavern crossing paths with a group of
demons carrying a CHEST

The men battle bravely cutting the demons down sending the
CHEST CRASHING to the ground

ON CHEST

It swings open and a fluorescent glow emanates out as the
SHARDS of IYISIS spill onto the ground

CUT TO
MT OLYMPUS

For the first time FEAR crosses the gods faces as they eye
the shards HERMES immediately races off in a BLUR as the

others follow suit racing towards
EXT CAVERN

- the mouth of the cavern where the Demons overwhelm
Stellios and the others and quickly regather the shards

INT CAVERN
Theseus fights his way forward when he sees the demons race

past him closely guarding the shards rushing them to the
Demon Lord as

EXT PLAINS OF MT TARTAROS

HERMES the swiftest of the gods races towards the
cavern

The Hundred Handed Beast continues to pummel his attackers

the Demon Lord loads a shard into the bow and FIRES --
HURTLING the SHARD forward --

STRIKING him in the chest

The beast’s terrible cries echo through the cavern as the
Demon Lord FIRES more and more shards at him
EXT CAVERN

Alarm crosses Hermes face as he races inside wielding two
swords

wounded
Hermes blows past Theseus closing in on the Demon Lord --

-- but the Demon Lord spots him and begins to FIRE finding
the range -- STRIKING Hermes in the NECK with a shard

The Messenger of the Gods CRASHES to the ground as Stellios
and the others join Theseus all looking on

And for the first time man sees a god die

And just then the other OLYMPIANS arrive but they’re too
late the Demon Lord turns and takes aim at the lock on the
great doors -- STRIKING it

Everyone looks on with bated breath as the doors swing open
and

IAPETUS the Titan leader a dark formidable figure
steps out

DEMON LORD
(kneels)
My Lord I come at your bidding

Iapetus nods and looks at the gods at the far end of the
cavern

TAPETUS
Kill them

The TITANS come storming out filled with five hundred years
of anger and rage

From her one good eye MEDUSA shoots a glare at a column of
HOPLITES near Theseus Her eye shimmers turning the men to
stone as --

-- the MINOTAUR races past her SMASHING through them
SHATTERING them to DUST as Theseus dives out of the way

ON ZEUS

he slings a BOLT STRIKING the Minotaur in the chest
hurtling him back as --

Come on men

Theseus urges them into battle as Iapetus slings BLASTS of
ENERGY hurtling back Poseidon and Helios

Iapetus when --

-- the Demon Lord takes aim and strikes Zeus with a SHARD
PIERCING his shoulder sending him backwards

ON THESEUS

THESEUS (CONTD)
We must kill him

Theseus and the men charge towards the Demon Lord cutting
down demons when -- in a FLASH -- Hyperion SLASHES Theseus as
he races past him

Theseus recoils in pain as Hyperion ZIPS around sword
poised moving for the death blow when --

-- Athena holds up a hand concentrating FREEZING HYPERION
IN MID STRIDE He futilely kicks and squirms when --

-- Aries SLAMS him with his hammer sending him flying across
the hall SMACK into a pillar

ON THESEUS

He gathers himself and charges towards the Demon Lord who
sees him and takes aim FIRING -- but Theseus dives forward
avoids the strike and CUTS the Demon Lord casting the bow
from his hands

DEMONS rush to pick it up when --

-- APOLLO CUTS them down with a WAVE of ARROWS as he rushes
towards the bow LAUNCHING three ARROWS at a time when --

-- Cryptos SMASHES him with his mallet hurtling backwards as
the bow skitters across the floor amongst the chaos

ON ATHENA
Her eyes widen as a dagger pierces her side

ARIES
NO

DRAKAS a female Titan grins as she hurls another dagger at
Athena

But Helios catches sight of the twirling blade and
quickly incinerates it with a STREAM of FIRE saving Athena
before

- casting a STREAM at Drakas who falls rearward avoiding
the strike

ON ARIES

he races towards Athena when Atlas cuts him off The two
WARRIORS square off exchanging blows as

Theseus kicks the Demon Lord backwards and CUTS him with
his sword

Suddenly the Titan FOMORIAN draws a deep breath and SCREAMS
but it’s not an ordinary scream -- it’s an EAR PIERCING SONIC
SWELL

MAN and GOD alike cover their ears in pain as the Titans
unaffected take advantage

The Demon Lord STABS Theseus in the leg as Atlas SMASHES
Aries with a hammer strike and Iapetus PUMMELS Zeus with a
blow

-- but Theseus digs deeps and SLASHES the Demon Lord
knocking him back before summoning all his strength
hurling his sword at Fomorian --

-- it SAILS through the air and STRIKES the TITAN in the
MOUTH IMPALING him

SILENCE RINGS out but the damage has been done The Titans
press on Cryptos SMASHES Aries and Medusa turns Apollo and
Dionysus to stone as

- Iapetus takes aim at Zeus Each raises their hand and
FIRES Their beams collide pushing them back

they slide across the floor each straining to hold back
the other’s beam

STELLIOS
Theseus The bow

Theseus turns and sees the bow on the ground near him when

- the energy of the two clashing beams mix until they
EXPLODE in a BLAST of WHITE LIGHT --

-- knocking EVERYONE to the ground as the EXPLOSION shakes
the hall like an EARTHQUAKE CRACKING the WALLS

PILLARS CRASH DOWN SPLASHING LARGE PLUMES of DUST into the
AIR It’s absolute MAYHEM as the cavern begins to IMPLODE

Theseus scours the hall for the bow only to see the Demon
Lord scoop it up

ON ZEUS

he takes in the scene HERMES lies dead Dionysus and Apollo
are frozen in stone while the other gods stagger from their
wounds He has no choice

ZEUS
Fall back to Olympus

They all flee as CRUMBLED MASONRY rains down

NARRATOR (VO)
And so the war of the gods was renewed

EXT MT TARTOROS

Zeus hurls lighting BLASTING a path through the legions of
demons that surround Mt Tartaros

NARRATOR (VO)
For men many of whom dismissed the tales
of old

ON THESEUS STELLIOS and HERON as they race along in Zeus’
wake

NARRATOR (VO (CONT’D)
lacked the providence to see this
end While others

ON MEGALLOS and the ORACLE as they run out behind them
NARRATOR (VO) (CONTD)
- didn’t do enough to spread the wisdom
they knew to be true But perhaps the
gravest judgement fell upon the gods

ON ARIES carrying a bloody ATHENA as HELIOS casts fire in
front of them

NARRATOR (VO) (CONTD)
For they too had once conspired with
others to win victory in this struggle
but never did they imagine that this evil
would arise anew

ON ZEUS as a troubled look on his brow worsens
NARRATOR (VO) (CONT’D)
For those who champion the cause of good
rarely foresee the depths of evil’s
wickedness and resolve
EXT MT OLYMPUS - LATER

The gods haggardly race up to the stone colonnade where Aries
lays down Athena She gasps for air struggling to breathe

ZEUS
She is passing into shadow let her go

Aries can’t believe it as life begins to leave her Their
eyes meet if only for a moment and then she’s gone

ARIES
pause
We should have done more We should
have intervened sooner Zeus You are to
blame

Rage fills Aries as he yells

ARIES (CONTD)
Your misprision has allowed the Titans to
be unleashed

ZEUS
I’ve made mistakes Aries That I do not
deny But I swore to give man free will
To give them the chance to choose their
own path If that is my greatest sin
then I have but one regret

Zeus looks at the remaining gods all bloodied from battle
ZEUS (CONTD)

How could I have not foreseen this
treachery
EXT BASE OF MT OLYMPUS

Streams of human REFUGEES make their way up the various hills
and into the caves

NARRATOR (VO)

And while the gods took refuge atop Mt
Olympus the remnants of mankind sought
sanctuary in the hills nearby

ON STELLIOS atop a horse as he approaches Theseus and the
others

STELLIOS
They’re all overcome by fear They’re
breaking for the hills they cannot be
rallied

Theseus takes in the scene all around him is a VISTA of
DEFEAT If only for a moment he despairs as the Oracle
approaches

ORACLE
You must remain steadfast for it is your
bravery the men look to for strength

THESEUS
My bravery got my father and countless
others killed

ORACLE
If not for you even more would have
fallen

THESEUS
What do you want from me I’m just a
man

ORACLE
A brave man is always more than just a
man Honor your father and go about
his bidding

Fight until the last gasp
He looks at her taken aback

HERON
Theseus

Stellios rushes over

HERON (CONTD)
The Demons and Titans march for Olympus

Theseus stands in attention
ZEUS (0OS)
They are coming for us

Zeus and Helios emerge from the darkness

ZEUS (CONTD)
You must gather what you can and leave
this place We shall charge out and meet
the Titans in battle one last time
To our doom we charge But we charge
nonetheless

Theseus thinks for a moment

THESEUS
No this is our struggle as much as it
is yours Why should we abandon you to
fight alone

ZEUS
Because the tide has turned and a truly
dark age approaches Some vestige of
good must live on to rise up anew

THESEUS
Then let others do so

He slowly regains heart

THESEUS (CONTD)
For to see right and not to do it is
cowardice (to all those around) And I
see no cowards here do you

Stellios steps forward

STELLIOS
No

HERON
Nor I

Other men begin to gather around

THESEUS
An old man once told me about the never
ending struggle I didn’t know it then
but truer words have never been spoken
For this conflict is everlasting fought
on every stage imaginable It is good
versus evil God against Titan man
versus man In the end all you can do is
choose with whom you shall stand

More and more men take heed
THESEUS (CONTD)
A terrible swell grows inside me and
urges me forward I cannot help but heed
it All of you know what I speak of
For the same righteousness pumps in your
chest Listen to it Take heart and let
it lead you Let us make our stand
against this evil Let us fight for the
good of the world What do you say men
Do we run in fear or do we stand with the
gods and die like men

The crowd lets out a cheer as Zeus looks on

ZEUS
If that is the will of free men so be
it Come join us atop Olympus as we

prepare for battle

The men take up their weapons and follow the gods when the
Oracle takes Theseus aside

ORACLE
Theseus I want you to have this

She hands him a small parchment He reads what is written on
it and is moved

ORACLE (CONTD)
Carry it with you

He nods and then lifts King Petros’s pendant from his neck
placing it around hers before leaning down and kissing her

EXT MT OLYMPUS - LATER

The Gods and the men watch the demons and Titans amass below
as Theseus joins them

THESEUS
Zeus may I have your council

With your blessing I would like to try

something

The Demon Lord recognizes Theseus as he walks over to him
bow of Cronos in tow
DEMON LORD
I should have killed you a long time ago

THESEUS
You don’t have the mettle to kill me

DEMON LORD
Such insolence It’s because of you I
stand here now

Theseus looks at him curiously as the Demon Lord transforms
into Lord Thanos Theseus is taken aback

LORD THANOS
But now I will have more than just a
kingship

He aims the bow at Theseus

LORD THANOS (CONTD)
I will savor your death

Theseus prepares for the death blow when suddenly --

out of Poseidon’s reach but it’s a trap

in front of her unwittingly shielding her from the blow as
it SLAMS them hard to the ground

Stellios quickly goes to fire again when Medusa glares up at
him eye shimmering

NO

But it’s too late Stellios turns to stone and the bow of
Cronos with him

-- in a flash Hyperion rushes at them SMASHING into the
chest scattering the shards about as

- Iapetus rallies the remaining Titans having weathered
the onslaught

EXT MOUNTAINSIDE - SAME TIME
Grave concern crosses the Oracle’s face as she looks on

In battle there are often men that should
not be there

jaws of war’s cruelty
More and more men fall dead as the enemy surges ahead

NARRATOR (VO)

But one out of the many thousands is a

warrior and it is in him the true valor

of mankind lives
ON THESEUS

NARRATOR (VO) (CONTD)
For it is he who brings the others home

He realizes he must act quickly when just then --

HERON (0S)
Medusa

Heron catches a glimpse of her as she approaches The men
quickly move behind a boulder as

Theseus uses the inside of his shield as a mirror eyeing
her His mind races when he notices a crevice in the valley
floor nearby

ON MEDUSA

she slithers forward amongst demons as

-- Theseus jumps out from behind the boulder and rolls into
the shallow crevice undetected amongst the chaos a bow in
tow

He eyes Medusa’s reflection in a shield Megallos holds as he
pans with her from behind the boulder

She moves towards the crevice as Theseus waits anxiously when
suddenly --

-- Megallos’s shield crashes to the ground as a horde of
demons attack him and Heron

ON THESEUS

he loses sight of Medusa but does his all to remain calm as
he hears the rattle of her tail

She casts her shadow on him as she stops sensing looking
all around not realizing Theseus

- eyes her from below holding his breath as he pulls
back the bowstring when suddenly --

-- she looks down at him but the arrow strikes her in the
chin JERKING her HEAD UP as her EYE SHIMMERS WILDLY --

-- he quickly rises to his feet and strikes her with his
sword slicing her head off as she thrashes about

Medusa’s wail echoes through the valley drawing the
attention of

Hyperion who races towards Theseus swords drawn
blurring past demons

Heron spots him closing in

HERON (CONTD)
Theseus watch out

Theseus spins around sees Hyperion cut down Heron and
realizes he has an instant to react --

-- he lifts Medusa’s head holding it out in front of him

Horror crosses Hyperion’s face as Medusa’s eye shimmers
turning him to stone just before --

-- Theseus rolls out of the way as Hyperion CRASHES against
the valley floor CRUMBLING to PIECES

Theseus rises and looks over to Heron as Megallos quickly
kneels down next to him

ON HERON AND MEGALLOS
HERON (CONTD)
Now there are but two

Life begins to leave him
HERON (CONTD)
If you are the one tell my family I love
them tell them our tale

Megallos nods before he turns to Theseus and shakes his head
gravely

Anger shoots through Theseus as he turns to the demon army
with the head of Medusa and in an instant

becomes the most feared of all -- a warrior with the
power of a Titan

He flashes Medusa’s head casting a legion of demons to
stone Fear quickly ripples through their rank and file when
suddenly --

-- Iapetus hurls a BLAST casting Medusa’s head from
Theseus’s hand sending it off the ridge and into the ocean

Zeus quickly responds striking Iapetus with a BOLT wounding
him as Atlas charges at Theseus

Theseus snatches a spear from a fallen demon and thrusts it
at the charging Titan but --

-- Atlas cuts the spear shaft in two and slashes Theseus
across the chest as he tries to dive out of the way

Aries charges towards Atlas as he strikes Theseus again with
a vicious blow and moves in for the kill

But Theseus feints being severely wounded and quickly --

-- rips a sword from the ground and rolls forward striking
the Titan just below the knee --

-- sending Atlas toppling to the ground where Aries finishes
him with a SMASHING blow

Theseus slowly rises

ATRES
Well done

Theseus nods before turning to the remaining men
THESEUS

Come on men Today we show the world

what the valor of men can bring forth

Do honor to our fallen brothers

He leads the charge WAR CRIES ring out as the men plunge
into the heart of what’s left of the demon war machine

THESEUS (CONTD)

Theseus spots the Demon Lord and battles his way towards him
with renewed strength

They square off exchanging blows but Theseus’s will is
unyielding

He unleashes a flurry of strikes cutting the Demon Lord
repeatedly overwhelming him making him suffer for all he’s
done

before finally plunging his sword into the Demon Lord’s
chest killing him with one final twist of the wrist

Theseus stands over him for a moment breathing heavily as
Megallos joins him

They exchange a nod death is certain for one of them

THESEUS (CONTD)
Come on men

They surge ahead as blood seeps from Theseus’s many wounds

He staggers moving painfully forward sheer will driving him
as

Zeus and Aries battle with Iapetus and the few remaining
Titans

Theseus’s drops to a knee but Megallos lifts him

Theseus can barely stand He looks around unseeingly Blood
oozing from his wounds but he forges onwards as

the men form lines on both sides of him awed by his
courage

CUT TO

a tear streaks down her face as she looks on
BACK TO THESEUS

filling the men with a sense of inevitability as they
charge ahead and break the back of Demon Army HURTLING them
into the few remaining Titans

For in the end Theseus’ valor saved not
only man but god alike

ON ZEUS
He is astounded by Theseus’s bravery He hurriedly rushes to

his side as he crashes down to the ground struggling for
breath

Fear not my friend you have earned the
Elysian Fields a thousands times over

A look of calm slowly crosses Theseus’ face He glimpses at
the Oracle’s parchment as life begins to leave him

ON THE ORACLE

ORACLE (VO)
To live in the hearts and minds of those
we leave behind is not to die

ON THESEUS
