MANHATTAN GHOST STORY

INT TRAIN - Day

Rattling train making time through New England countryside from
somewhere a disembodied voice

AARON (V0)
The first thing I remember Is
the train ride

SEE him now carrying his bags AARON CRAY mid-thirties
unassuming smile Passing each full compartment seeing the array
of commuter travelera Until the voice of his memory recalis

AARON (V0)
I remember seeing the woman

and compartment with one seat empty Next to a middle-aged WOMAN
conservatively dressed

AARON (V0)
eand suddenly thinking for
reasons I couldn’t nameI don’t
want to sit with her

Watch nim peering through the glass She suddenly stares STRAIGHT
UP at him An expectant look on her refined features

AARON (V0)
I was ashamed to think such
a thing So of course I sat

And Aaron pushes through the door He smiles at the woman who
continues to stare at him unsmiling somehow eager He lifts his
bags te the overhead rack And when he takes his seat he looks up
into her intense unsettling gaze

WOMAN
Hellc I’m Madeline

More than abrupt An energy to it that really takes him back
Naturally shy Aaron manages a friendly smile

AARON
I’m Aaron Cray It’s nice to
meet you

She doubts that Studies him appraisingly

MADELINE
---you’re going to a new job
In the City A book you’re
weiting

Aaron is stunned He glances across at their companions A
watery-eyed PRIEST fixed on his paperback An anorexic teenage

Aaron To the darker side of
Auman nature

He ioesn’ now ynat to do Glances nelplessly back at the priest
who is turning a 3ingle page Dack and forth slightly unnerving
lixe a deractive loop of videotape The girl horribly thin
CRACKS her yum more loudly than social convention permits

MADELINE
They don’ care Aaron They
never do

When he turns back the ‘oman nas leaned perceptibly nearer

MADELINE
I think you’ve locked your heart
away BO you won’t be hurt ever
again Of course that’s pathetic

Albeit sweet

Silanca

AARON
Is going now

But as he ises to reach ‘or his bags
MADELINE
Your another is dead isn’t
she She committed suicide

He 3tops

MADELINE
She wrote a little note that
said ‘This isn’t what I wanted
Frank This isn’t it at all’
And then she shot herself in the head

And as further explanation

MADELINE
That was a disturbingly masculine
act Most women slit their wrists
(beat)
Frank was your father He’s dead
too

Aaron is reeling now Eyes searching her proper features

AARON
Who are you

MADELINE
You are going remember You
don’t want to sit here I make
you nervous

AARON
That’s not the word

MADELINE
I made my husband so nervous
he left me for another man for
Christ’s sake

And in the midst of his confusion he feels her anguish Straight
to her eyes

AARON (softly)
I’m sorry

She looks at him As if deciding
MADELINE
You know Aaron I believe
you are

Aaron pulls his bag down from the rack so awkward that he nearly
clobbers the anorexic girl who never even notices

MADELINE
Nice reading you mind Aaron
See you again

Aaron nods One quick glance at the others who are completely
oblivious and he stumbles from the compartment

HOLD on Madeline Watching him go

EXT CENTRAL PARK - DAY

Aaron cutting through Cantral Park with his bags two careras
around hig neck still clearly disturbed by his encounter

AARON (V0)
This guy I knew Paul DeGraff
said I could crash at his place
during ny shoot Sort of surprising
actually We hadn’t seen each other
in awhile

Blustery April sorning wind whipping at him

AARON (V0)
We grew up together but Paul
went on to great success He
was in Paris on some big deal
so his place would be

His stride slows Over there by the pond Two POLICEMEN in heavy
winter coats look down at

-and LITTLE GIRL laid out at the edge of the water Golden curls
small angelic face eyes shut So beautiful and still Incong-
ruously she wears a white snowsuit She is drenched Passersby
are passing by but -

Aaron being Aaron is stopped by the sight Always hesitant to
come forward his first instincts are to reach slowly for his
camera Focusing on the child through his lens now the shield
which keeps him safe as compassionate observer

AARON
Is sheis she all right

hoping against hope but knowing the answer CLICKING off a
shot moving laterally to another angle not coming closer The
short policeman has a puffy red face Shrugs

POLICEMAN
She fell through the ice
Musta been that sudden freeze

Freeze Aaron looks out over the wind-rippled pond Looks again
at the policemen bundled up for below zero This doesn’t compute

POLICEMAN
--musta been that sudden freeze

AARON
Theres no freeze there couldnt
have been a

(beat)
-»where’s her parents

POLICEMAN
They never showed up
-5-
Hesitantiy Aaron comes forward at last kneels by the child so
peaceful in death Touches her with genuine sorrow His eyes

singer and then he looks up The busy crowd bustling by Hes
angry that

AARON
look at this Not one of
them even notices

POLICEMAN
New York

And Aaron shivers at that thought A last look at the child and
he rises slowly So helpless nothing he can say or do And as he
eads off

POLICEMAN (0S)
» musta been that sudden freeze

EXT CENTRAL PARK WEST - DAY

Aaron heading up the avenue eyes lost in disturbed thought As
oblivious to the passersby as they are to him Until

SMALL VOICE (0S)
Hey Mister wanna puppy Only
two bucks

And he turns The BOY is about seven poorly dressed A nervous
smile and a cardboard box with six tiny puppies scarcely more than
newborns With him his sister NATASHA not quite four Rich
blonde curls huge dark eyes she’s lapping at a big waffle cone

BOY
Hey Mister wanna puppy Only
two bucks

And Aaron puts his heavy thoughts aside He smiles at these
children On an impulse nods sure He lifts the smallest puppy
in his hands a smoky gray furball

AARON
Well this is the best one
I‘d pay five for hin

And pulls a five dollar bill out of his pocket Puts it in the
cardboard box But the boy just stares up

BOY
Hey Mister wanna puppy Only
two bucks

A little disconcerting Aaron looks to the five dollars in the
box To the puppy in his hands

AARON
Uh sure This one okay
-6-
But the boy says nothing Shivers in the wind Natasha keeps

-apping at her waffle cone Big eyes staring A trickle of fudge
running over her hand

AARON
Kinda cold for you guys to be
out huh How about if I walk
you home

BOY
Tan’t Our momma’s there she’s
always there She sent us out
to sell these Unfinished business

Something in that last makes Aarcn pause Stare at these sweet
children

AARON
Okay guys Just don’t stay too
long huh

No answer He tousles Nastasha’s head affectionately Heads off
with his puppy

The children watch him go And when he is too far away to hear

BOY (calls out)
Hey Mister wanna puppy
Only two bucks

EXT WEST EIGHTIES - DAY

Aaron coming down a West Eighties street hands in his pockets
eyes wandering disoriented

AARON (V0)
I mean New York is always
weird but

Stops This is the building Checks the number against a slip of
paper Looks across to the puppy rambling way up the street full
of spirits It stops to look back stare quizzically at us So
Aaron

- WHISTLES sharply The puppy DARTS back Straight past Aaron
up the steps and as someone exits DASHES inside Gone

INT HALLWAY - DAY

The smoky gray puppy sits at the door to 4B his engine running
Aaron checks the number against the slip Looks down to a potted
plant near the door

AARON (V0)
The more I thought of it the
more puzzling it was that Paul
had offered me his place

Rummaging around the base of the plant now Finding the key
AARON (V0)
We had never been close He
was sort of a difficult guy

Opens the door The puppy CHARGES in Aaron follows

AARON (V0)
The first thing I noticed was
the smell

Moving through the spacious expensively decorated apartzent As
if he’s following a scent

AARON (V0)
--vaguely pleasant A smell of
damp sweet wood

Hearing a cheerful YIP into the kitchen where hestops cold
Puppy sits at the feet of a breathtaking YOUNG WOMAN Flowing
auburn hair dark eyes Tight faded jeans cut-off top She 3it3
casually at a round table dealing solitaire with slender singers
Not looking up

YOUNG WOMAN
So what’s his name

Aaron is slightly dumbstruck

AARON
The dog

She keeps playing red seven on the black eight Wriggles ner nose
at the next card She seems to have forgotten hin

AARON
He’s the Silver Bullet Cos
he won’t slow me down
She glances at the puppy Just wagging its tail staring up at Jer
AARON
Two little kids were selling
them they were so sweet but
really strange
But she’s not listening Eyes locked to the dog

YOUNG WOMAN
Hey Bullet want a kiss

SNAPS her fingers and the Bullet LEAPS to her lap She xisses iis
gwouth straightforwardly Looks up

YOUNG WOMAN
Now what’s your name

Direct open stare She is so beautiful
“8

AARON
I’m uhAaron Cray Im4and
photographer

YOUNG WOMAN
this explains the cameras
What explains you

No smile Wo attitude Just confident and straight as hell

AARON
Paul gave me the key

YOUNG WOMAN
He’s never nentioned you

Awkward On the defensive

AARON
Well weve known each other
all our livesthrough school
andwe haven’t always gotten
along I suppose

YOUNG WOMAN
-and why is that

The dark eyes probing reading Looking for something

YOUNG WOMAN
«youre notassertive enough
for his taste

Sounds like an attack

AARON
---yen he thinks I’m a wimp

Edge to that Suddenly Aaron doesn’t seem lixe a wimp at all

YOUNG WOMAN
and what do you think

AARON
---that he’s sort of an arrogant
dickhead With some charm as a
saver

Aaron looks pretty pissed off She doesn’t care

YOUNG WOMAN
Imean What do you think about

you Are you a wimp
He’s been holding his bags Drops then now with a THUD
AARON

«Bust be taking this kinda
shit from a perfect stranger
-9-
And her eyas cloud with feeling Her voica softens to a wisp

YOUNG WOMAN
Net perfect Aaron Not perfect
at all

and goes back to her solitaire hand He’s sorry he was angry

AARON
I’m sorry I didn’t mean to get
into an argument and

She doesn’t look up

AARON
And I’m sorry I barged in on you
Paul didn’t tell me someone was
living h

YOUNG WOMAN
on I’m not There’s no one
living here

Now she looks up The smile is playful even enticing

YOUNG WOMAN
I’m Julianne Potter I used
to be Paul’s girlfriend

AARON
He’s never mentioned you

She never looks up

JULIANNE
Then again you don’t see hin
all that much

Red seven on black eight Wriggles her nose at the next card

JULIANNE
Youve got a key I’ve got a
picture on the mantle two roons
back with Paul’s arm around ay
black evening dress Now we both
need an apartnent

And turns straight to his eyes

JULIANNE
We could share it

He just stands there She studies that

JULIANNE
Not a flattering response

She twists around in the chair throwing out one izpossibly long
leg Her body is amazing
-10-
JULIANNE

De you find me unattractive
AARON

You mean am I gay or blind
No

She liked that First trace of a ile Even at one-tenth
it’s electric Power

JULIANNE
Are you shy Aaron

AARON
A little But I live with it

Somehow she liked that even nore

JULIANNE
So why won’t you live with me

Is she teasing She must be But it’s all very light and
charming

AARON
You’re Julianne Potter You
used to be Paul’s girlfriend

An And her smile fades When she turns away we see an orange on
her table Anda knife She picks them up

JULIANNE
Maybe this would be just the
thing To improve Paul’s image
of you

Starts to peel the orange which is blood red inside
AARON
--4f he’s that twisted why do
you see him
Every slow move she makes is effortlessly sensual
JULIANNE
then again We both need a
place Badly
(turns)
You like blood oranges Aaron
And reaches out a red succulent section He stares at it
AARON
Funny thing is I’m crazy about
them They’re just hard to find

She’s still holding it Dark eyes watching him
JULIANNE
Well Are you going to come
and get it

But he doesn’t move 50 she stands walks boldly to him Lifts
the orange to her own lips And around the mouthful

JULIANNE
No sweat Aaron The place
ds yours

And walks out He stares at the expty doorway for a full beat

AARON (V0)
Just like that She was gone

Byes flicking to the empty table

AARON (V0)
»even her cards

His eyes iinger there

AARON (V0)
I didn’t want to like her

Then come up To the eager puppy

AARON (V0)
And it bothered me that I was

Close-cropped hair soft pale eyes A hard intellectual’s mouth

SERENA

architecture and the angles just

She stops He’s staring out at the city in fading light

SERENA
Am I keeping you up

He blinks His boyish saile
-1l2-
AARON
I’m sorry I’ve had a confusing
day

She’s not at all charmed In fact wary

SERENA
Look you should have been
here four days ago

He‘’s sorry But not anxious which is the effect she wanted

SERENA
--because if your heart isn’t
in this book I can just go
farther down ay list

He looks at her openly

AARON
Whatever you think best

She would have preferred a little groveling

SERENA
I’m not sure I like your
attitude

AARON
I’m getting a lot of that today
Should I try groveling

She thinks that over

SERENA
Sure

INT PUBLISHER’S CORRIDOR - LATER

Aaron down the hall his portfolio under his arm Into an empty
elevator He presses LOBBY And hears

MANS VOICE (0S)
Hold that please

The doors have begun to close so Aaron reaches out quickly to
press DOOR OPEN And it does Sut nobody gets in S80 he lets go
of the button And just as the doors begin to close

MANS VOICE (0S)
Hold that please

and Aaron STABS OUT Hits the button But no one comes So he
sticks his head out looks down the hall

-at the far far end of the corridor a receptionist chats on her
phone No one in between So Aaron looks in the other direction
to find
e-i2g-
and8 Biddle-aged MAN in 4 slightly threadbare serge suit He is
unnaturally still Almost frozen in mid-stride One finger
pointing vaguely in our direction fyes locked ahead

AARON
Excuse me sir Did you call
the elevator

But the man says nothing

AARON
Sir Are you all right

Only the eyes move straight to Aaron No sound and Aaron steps
back into the elevator visibly confused As the doors close

MANS VOICE (0S)
Hold that please

And as he rides down alone

AARON (mutters to himself)
Mimes They’1l work anywhere

INT APARTMENT - NIGHT

Photo of Julianne black evening dress tropical drink Hazy smile
of a light high The guy with his arm around her must be PAUL
DeGRAFF Shorter than she is wiry with dark good looks An
intensity to him that jumps off the print Wheels within wheels
PULL BACK to

Aaron wearing only boxer shorts studying the photo Sets it
back on the mantle positioning it just so The way it was Back
through the apartment to the kitchen The Bullet is lapping water
from a cut-crystal bowl Newspaper covers the floor

AARON
If you need anything at all
Keep it to yourself

The Bullet doesn’t object Aaron strokes him goodnight But as he
turns to go

A silhouette fills the doorway
AARON (V0)
--it was as if she’d been there
all the while And I’d somehow
uissed her

She steps through the door A neutral yet somehow tander stare

JULIANNE
Hello Aaron I came to visit

She walks to him slowly
JULIANNE
I‘ve been thinking about you

All day

She comes very close Reaches a slender hand and places her

fingertips

--gently On his chest

- JULIANNE (softly)
Were you thinking About me

And he steps back Just an inch But it’s enough

JULIANNE
You’re worried about Paul

Is that it

JULIANNE
That ended Such a long time ago

And veryvery

He’s staring in her eyes

badly

JULIANNE
I thought you liked me too I
thought I saw that

AARON
I’m sorry it’s
Xnow you

justI don’t

That brings a silence She raises a hand to touch him but she’s

afraid to And seeing this
AARON

(so awkward)

Thisthis isn’t how I work inside
I’m an old-fashioned guy

And her smile fades

JULIANNE
You don’t have to be shy

But watching his face

JULIANNE
« maybe you do

Somehow the shyness only seems to make her like hin nore

JULIANNE
Do you want me to go away

That was vulnerable and real

It strikes him to the heart to have

hurt her so She sees that too Touches his hair
JULIANNE
May I sleep on your sofa
Auron Please

He touches her arm Staring at the black eyes Nods sure And
holding the eye contact

a slowly backs away Smiles at him Sadness and simplicity
nee

JULIANNE
-good-night Aaron

And she leaves HOLD on him Staring after her

INT BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

Aaron sleeping Fitful PUSH IN closer on

AARON’S DREAMan eight-year-old BOY Aaron as a child creeping
down a darkened stairwell Dead of night Something in his hand
He flicks it ON a flashlight the beam lighting his way around a
corner and into

the darkened living room The sharp beam finds a CHRISTMAS
TREE its glass balls quivering just slightly beneath the tinsel
as if the tree or the room were breathing And beneath the-tree
a careful stack of wrapped GIFTS As little Aaron approaches
the beam lovingly traces the outline of his packages One is
Clearly a standing bicycle One round a ball or a globe he
kneels to touch it and

€ soft noise from behind makes hin

STARTLE WHIRL around as we CUT

BACK TOadult Aaron WAKING UP suddenly Eyes wide fearful
Holding himself still now Very still

Except for the breathing

INT BEDROOM - LATER

Aaron lying in darkness Eyes wide and staring They glance at
the clock for the millionth time It says 317 Slowly now he
climbs from his bed Down the hall to the doorway of

the large living room There in a far corner she is curled in
a ball on the sofa A blanket clutched around her Sleeping with
the peace of angels And Aaron’s arzs absently hug hinself as
-he stands and watches She’s still there

INT BEDROOM - DAWN

Aaron in bed Stirring Waking And with his first thought he
rises Pulling on a robe down the hallway

the sofa is empty And in that moment so is he
-16-
AARON
Julianne

Too loud A shade of panic in that When no sound comes back the
sense of loss washes through him Bone deep The feeling of
missing something that has long been a part of him He sinks now
to sit on his heels head down trying to fight back the wave as

JULIANNE (0S singing)
Where are you going
My little one little one

And a slow smile spreads across his face and his spirit

JULIANNE (08 singing)
Where are you going
My baby my own

Sweet lullaby from some distant room Pure innocent voice

JULIANNE (0S singing)
Turn around and you’re two
Turn around and you’re four
Turn around and you’re a young girl
Going out of the door

He breathes his feeling for her Deep and deeper and when no
more song comes he goes to find her °

Bathroom first But she’s not there Everything neat not a
trace Down the hall to the den already turned into Aaron’s dark
room No one

AARON
Hullio

calling to the air Back to the living room Empty Silent
The fear begins to creep up through him as he backs into the
hailway to see

the kitchen door open His shoulders relax Strides toward it
a little too quick for casual Calls out

AARON
How’s the Bullet doin’ You
find his food in th

as he enters to find the Bullet asleep And very such alone
On the table a solitaire hand laid out Next card to be played
a red seven As he fingers the card

-a soft CLICK Distant From the front door maybe He
FREEZES Calls out

AARON
That you

There is nothing He drops the card HOLD on it as we HEAR his
slow footsteps retreat
EXT FIFTH AVENUE - DAY

Rich hard-locking woman through the window of PAO Schwartz Her
laser eye assessing a huge Gund stuffed platypus as if it were an
emerald brooch cCLICK-CLICK CLICK-CLICK PULL BACK to see our

view has been through Aaron’s shutter As he readies another shot
he hears a YIPPING Turns to see

-the Bullet has discovered a subject of his own

shuffling toward us absently murmuring to himself He is
young not yet twenty with shoulder length hair and a flowing
moustache from the Sixties Even the stub of a Prank Zappa goatee
He wears a faded blue uniform jacket from Sgt Pepper

Aaron readies his Nikon as our anachronistic hippie keeps heading
straight for us Close enough now to see the t-shirt beneath his
open uniform jacket WAR IS NOT HEALTHY FOR CHILDREN AND OTHER
LIVING THINGS

Close enough to see fire in the young eyes that suddenly look
straight up to us As we pull the camera up we see him through
the shutter now but he THRUSTS out his hand biocking our view
The Nikon comes down

HIPPIE
What is that man What the
HELL is that

AARON
It’s just a camera I’11 pay
you for a picture one picture

Aaron’s easy smile The boy screws his face into paranoia

HIPPIE
Why

AARON
Well I’m a photographer

HIPPIE
For which side man

Aaron doesn’t quite know about that But his hesitation makes the
boy more than angry A crazed glint in

HIPPIE
FOR WHICH SIDE MAN FOR
WHICH SIDE

As if Aaron were deaf As he looks around the passersby must be
deaf too No one gives this a flicker of attention New York
shit When Aaron looks back the boy is right in his face Byes
glowing
719-

-BLOOD ORANGES tumble out Four five dozen asy At his feet
the note He bends slowly to read

AARON (V0)
what else are you crazy
about‘

And smiles From his soul Then looks around the room There
on the table

-the solitaire hand still laid out He wanders over Touches
the empty chair The cards Everything makes him think of her
increases the longing As he stares down at the hand

-the red seven sits waiting His fingers lift the card Gently
lay it on the black eight When he looks up Bullet is there And
from the look on his face

AARON
--I know I wiss her too

EXT FIFTH AVENUE - DAY

Back on Fifth Avenue walking his photo beat looking for subjects
Aaron suddenly jog-steps to one side We look down to see he had
almost stepped on

-a snail The tiny creature is doggedly crossing the pavement
miraculously still intact despite the passersby Aaron crouches
low his bedy now something of a shield and gently lifts the snail
in his hand Watches it for a beat

AARON (V0)
I don’t know why I did it

Crosses the sidewalk Sinks down beside the curb
AARON (V0)
I’ve never been a fanatic on
reverence for life

carefully releases the snail into the gutter As he watches it
inch off a HAND reaches slowly from behind him and

TOUCHES his hair he FREAKS WHIRLS his face inches from a
murmured
JULIANNE
God I missed you
-a6 if surprised by how very much She sinks down so close to
h

JULIANNE
Do you hate ne

The question seens desperately straight He stares at her sweet
face
-20-
AARON
»why would I do that
JULIANNE
Because of the way I an

AARON
I don’t know the way you am

He smiles It makes her less apprehensive

AARON
and if it’s different from this
I don’t want to

Her fingertips touch his face She stares so intently Slips her
hand into his

JULIANNE
Let’s take a walk

She rises gently tugging him up A held look and they start up
the avenue hand-in-hand We PULL BACK to a LONG ANGLE the couple
heading toward us As they come FOCUS ON

and8 MAN who stands watching them from behind Wiry and dark and
small He is PAUL DeGRAFF Staring at our couple with an inten-
sity we can feel from here Foot traffic flows around him and a
BIG GUY

BUMPS into him from behind Paul WHEELS a hair-trigger temper
The big guy just leoks down unimpressed Paul steps closer and

-8ays something One single word And the big guy begins to
« TWITCH His shoulders first his neck his head As Paul
watches the big guy’s bedy begins to VIBRATE SAVAGELY the
gyrations increasing more and more horrific his entire being
CONVULSING now in escalating SPASMS only

-no one seems to notice Except Paul He smiles slightly at the
grotesque agony thrusts his hands in his pockets and

--heads toward us Up the block
INT KITCHEN - NIGHT
Smoke billowing As it clears two faces look down at us
Julianne nearly in tears Murmurs
JULIANNE
This is so very disappointing

PULL BACK to see they are staring into a large slow-cook pot which
has somehow boiled over

AARON
What waid8 it
w2-
She stares down with such sadness
JULIANNE
It was veal curry creole TI

snuck in this aorning and fixed
it all upaust be Paul’s stove

Her little shrug

JULIANNE
I did sowant to impress you

He strokes her hair tenderly Whispers

AARON
Hey black eyes I’m impressed

She’s still gazing down at her creole

JULIANNE
I mean favorably

AARON
I’m past favorably closing
in on stupetied

Julianne is disconsolate He PLUNGES his hand into the pot and
stuffs hot food into his mouth Rolling his eyes in a mixture of
pain and simulated ecstasy Mmmm-good She is not reassured

JULIANNE
I’ll do it right tomorrow

She lifts the pot dumping the entire contents in the sink
JULIANNE
Just give me a minute I’11
pake you a five-spice omelette

AARON
There’s no eggs

She’s running water Stuffing veal and rice down the disposal
JULIANNE
There’s everything I told you
I snuck in

So he goes to the fridge Opens to find it indeed crammed with
everything Including

AARON
What’s this package with the
ribbon

She keeps cleaning the pot Never looks around
w22-

JULIANNE
A present Of course You sean
you didn’t get me one

And sensing his instant guilt

JULIANNE
That’s a joke Aaron

She turns now He seems so touched staring at the package

JULIANNE
---open it it’s just a couple
of books

So he does Slowly

JULIANNE
I wanted to see if we read
the same things

When he looks at the titles A small astonished smile A quiet
INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

They are sprawled in front of a softiy burning fireplace She wears
a man’s robe Could be Paul’s She’s teaching him the Japanese
game of ‘Go’ and we see countless white and gray stones spread
across the game board Looks complex He makes a nove and

looks up to her for approval A solemn shake of her head He
tries again Looks up like a little kid She takes his stone and
makes the move for him somewhere else

AARON
Why do they call this game
‘Go’ when I never get to

JULIANNE
‘Go’ is five in Japanese

No smile with
JULIANNE
When lovers play there’s a
tradition The winner chooses
the first five ways theyll make
love that night
This is not coming to him as entirely bad news

AARON
You made that up

JULIANNE

Shes just moving the stones When she looks up he is there
w25°

AARON
Why You expect to win

So close Her face twitches spasms into an enigmatic GRIN that
flickers and is gone He moves even closer murmurs

AARON
That grin what is that You
do it sonetines

She smiles lightly Her eyes flash with what could be taken for
mischief

JULIANNE
I have to grin sometimes
I’m falling apart
And before he can think or respond she moves to him Kisses hin
once beautifully perfectly His arms slide around her Ghyly
tentatively But it is Julianne who pulls back
He doesn’t understand Whispers only

AARON
- what

She takes a breath Shivers slightly

JULIANNE
I got scared

Scared

JULIANNE
Scared you’ll disappear

So fragile with that He has to stroke her And he smiles
Everything is all right

INT LIVING ROOM - LATER

She lies curled on the sofa in her blanket He kneels by her
pillow tucking her in for the night

AARON

on forever

in this light ‘They do look just as he says
JULIANNE
Did you ever call another woman
that
He’s about to deny it When he stops himself Has to smile
AARON
¥’know I think I did And
the strangest thing is I can’t
remember who
She doesn’t seem angry Only interested
JULIANNE
And did you love her very
very much
His smile slowly fades She reads his eyes

JULIANNE
You did

Reaches one long arm around his neck Whispers

JULIANNE
-then it’s all right

She kisses hin

JULIANNE
Good-night

INT LIVING ROOM - DAWN

CLOSE on Bullet who sits attentively in early morning light
Staring at the empty sofa perfectly made HEAR footfalls

AARON (0S)
--anyone for breakfast

sounded hopeful Maybe hoping against his fear When he
appears in the doorway he stares at the sofa Crestfallen but
down deep not surprised Bullet whimpers Aaron looks down

AARON
Okay breakfast for two

Back they go Down the hall to the kitchen whereAaron stops
The slowecook pot is simmering Taped neatly to it a note Aaron
staring from across the room
7250

AARON (V0)
It said ‘I’m not fit company
today at this and think of ne’

HOLD on his eyes

AARON (V0)
And then it said ‘You’1ll see ze
again When I’m presentable’

Watch him wonder About that word
EXT LEXINGTON AVENUE - DAY

Aaron working Stalking the city with a studiedly casual eye we
follow his VIEW now people on the street lingering on anyone who
is alone until our PAN moves across

-and8 gaunt FACE staring straight at us The anorexic girl Aaron
once saw on the train At her side her three equally thin con-
panions all trying to hail a taxi Without a word now the others
turn to watch Aaron too He is standing just staring back at
their expressionless eyes as

-8 cab pulls up behind them The door swings open But the
girls don’t notice The DRIVER a large Slavic man of perhaps
aixty calls out -

DRIVER
I don’t got til doomsday here
And there ain’t nobody else gonna
pick you up

They don’t seem to have heard But they must have for after a
frozen moment they turn Slowly stiffly they get into the cab
As it pulls away we HOLD on Aaron Watching them go

EXT CENTRAL PARK - DAY

Aaron working Central Park People wandering aimlessly going
anywhere briskly eating worrying gazing from benches He lowers
his camera from one subject and turns to notice

-the two POLICEMEN he once saw here As before they are bundled
in their warmest coats Even nore incongruous on this sunny spring
afternoon Their shoulders are hunched against some imagined cold
as they eat hot chestnuts from a paper cone

AARON (V0)
«oethe amazing part was No one
else was even noticing Mew York

He brings his camera up to capture the moment when a sudden
impulse makes him turn slowlyto the pond And there Far on
the other side

---a little girl Just like the one who drowned White snowsuit
perfect blonde curls She is wading out into the pond the water
nearly at her waist He is frozen watching her
-26-

AARON
LITTLE GIRL Go BACK TO
THE SHORE

She can’t hear him She is giggling wading deeper little hands
above her head The tite of her life

AARON
LITTLE GIRL GO BACK THAT‘S
DANGEROUS

And she looks up From across the pond directly to us Somehow
her little voice floats crystal clear across the water

LITTLE GIRL
--it’s okay I can do it now
Keeps wading deeper Aaren turns in panic toward the cops but

-they are gone He WHIRLS back to the pond and somehow the
little girl

stands safely on shore Gazing down at the ripples in the
water From here it seems that

AARON (V0)
-her snowsuit looked completely
dry Although I knew that was
impossible
The girl takes a step toward the pond and Aaron
-BOLTS after her

AARON
WAIT STAY THERE

Running RUNNING and from nowhere

and HAND GRABS Aaron’s camera STRAP TEARING it VICIOUSLY around
FLINGING Aaron to the GROUND Dazed he lurches to lock back to
the pond

but the girl has gone

WILLIE (0S)
What the HELL is that man

Aaron turns back to see him wild glint in the hollow young eyes
Unafraid Aaron slowly climbs to his feet looks evenly at the
young hippie

AARON
It’s a camera Willie I’m taking
pictures

WILLIE
Why
e272

-the same paranoid expression as before Zxactly the same
Aaron squints back into the trees But no sign of the little girl
rd

AARON
We’ve been through this Willie
I’m a photographer

WILLIE
Which fucking gide man You
qotta make a choice You
gotta COMMIT

The boy so agitated Is he scared or angry Gently now

AARON
Which side You’re talking
about the war son

As before the quiet voice softens Willie’s face His zotor slows

WILLIE
Yessir

AARON
There are no sides anynore
The war is over

The reaction is instantaneous Shock fear

WILLIE
There’s always war wan
theres

AARON
- Willie Vietnam ended when you
were about three years old The
only war since then was Iraq
which lasted four days

Willie is freaking Aaron only wants to calm nin

AARON
The Russians are crumbling
there’s no more enenies Willie
there’s not gonna be any more
wars to protest

But Willie GRASPS Aaron’s shirt and somehow LIFTS him from the
ground

WILLIE
FUCKING LYING SACKA SHIT

and FLINGS Aaron like a rag doll through ten feet of air to
CRASH against a tree ‘Crumpled on the grass Aaron blinks up

Willie stares across the distance Somehow the boy’s face is
compassionate now almost tander As if it is Aaron who has the
-28-

problem One that Willie can’t help him with The boy sadiy
shakes his head and walks off

INT APARTMENT - pUSK

Aaron letting himself in He stops inside the door Afraid to
call out Afraid not to Down the hall glancing into each exzpty
room And when he reaches the kitchen

- Julianne sits playing solitaire She is dressed quite
conservatively tonight a noticeable change Without looking up

JULIANNE
Youre late I was worried

AARON
You can’t believe what I saw in
the park There’s these ¢copg
dressed for winter and this
little girl sheshe

How to explain this
AARON
Two days ago she was deadthen

she’s in the water then she’s on
the shore but she’s dry

Stops Realizing

AARON

I’m babbling like an idiot huh
JULIANNE

Poor baby

And with that voice That smile He gets a little lost in her
JULIANNE
Are we having a breakdown
Or are we just in New York
He smiles He has to
JULIANNE
I was worried that you veren’t
coming back to ne
Dark eyes probing
JULIANNE
Did you have thoughts like
that Aaron Even a few
He shakes his head Not a one
AARON

So how are we tonight Are
you presentable
-29-
JULIANNE
That’s for you to judge
AARON

You look normal Which means
amazing

JULIANNE
Looks are deceiving

AARON
I’m starting to notice that
a lot

That freezes her Just a little

JULIANNE
What’s that mean

AARON
What I said before this is the
weirdest three days of my life

Crazy psychics oddball hippies
that little girl

AARON
And you Don’t you think
you’re a little mysterious
Her eyes are glistening She looks almost frightened

JULIANNE
Tell ne you won’t leave ne

AARON
Only you get to leave huh

JULIANNE
--does that sound so unfair

Hearing those words so earnestly said he has to smile No he
shakes his head I guess not

AARON
What do you see in ne

She looks so fragile so serious

JULIANNE
A sweetness of spirit
She says this from her heart It means the world to her

AARON
You don’t know that
JULIANNE
The hell I don’t

Draws a narrow ragged breath

JULIANNE
Aaron will you come with ze
to meet By parants

AARON
That sounded like you mean
right now

JULIANNE

Why do you think I’m dressed
like my Aunt Sophie

He has to grin at that Softly

AARON

I was starting to wonder

EXT BRONX - DUSK

Aaron and Julianne walking a bombed-out street
buildings are abandoned some of them only shells

around in complete confusion

AARON

I guess you’re sure they

live here

SULIANNE
-no Aaron it’s an elaborate

hoax

She seems a little annoyed But mostly edgy

JULIANNE
800n my confederates will
appear and steal your watch

AARON

Do you blame me for

JULIANNE
--not trusting me No
neighborhood used to be much
nicer believe ne

He does

JULIANNE
Please don’t
wention Paul His very name

And by the way
freaks then out

She seems a little upset hersel

Most of the
He‘’s looking

-i0-
-3l-
AARON
Any particular reason

vaywalking now No aatter the only cars around are junk heaps

JULIANNE
He’s an arrogant dickhead
with some charm a8 a saver

AARON
A rumor

JULIANNE
Turns out he was a big
disappointment

Yeh well

AARON
I can’t understand what you saw
in that guy in the first pl

JULIANNE
-he’s a type you know Charming
intelligent worldly Smart enough
to hide how self-centered and con-
trolling he is

Right up the steps Of a long-abandoned brownstone

JULIANNE
Until he can’t hide it Anymore

The door has been boarded up but the ancient nails are rusty and
she RIPS it open Strides into the darkened lobby like she does it
every day He has to hustle to catch up

AARON
What’s going on talk to ne
JULIANNE
I take it your parents aren’t
eccentric
AARON

Actually they’re dead
Heading to a stairwell Pitch black above then

JULIANNE
There you go nobody’s perfect

He grabs her arm and she WHIRLS on hin

SULIANNE
You think this is easy
And everything stops
e32-
JULIANNE
However strange this is for you
my parents are very dear to ne
They are precious and wonderful
educated and refined She’s a
mathematician and he’s a full
professor of modern European
history

Her eyes seem hurt angry But she winds her fingers through his

JULIANNE
And you need to meet then
Because I care for you

And Aaron feels lost guilt-stricken He wouldn’t have hurt her
for the world

JULIANNE
Now it’s only eight flights up
in the dark Hang on tight and
be a good sport

And she YANKS him up the stairs
INT ZIGHTH FLOOR - NIGHT

As they come to the landing Aaron finds the eighth floor is dimly
lit by two fixtures with low-wattage bulbs She clutches his hand
tightly Leads him to 806 knocks sharply loudly Then waits
licking her lips in nervous expectation Staring at the numerals
on the door until

It opens A handsome WOMAN stands there Elegant bones a snile
that lights the way her daughter’s can

JULIANNE
Mother this is my Aaron

The woman extends her hand

MOTHER
I’m Lorraine Aaron And this
is Thomas

She steps aside revealing a cozy apartment clean and bright Her
HUSBAND rises from his high-backed chair His double-breasted suit
is buttoned his silk tie immaculate He winks at Aaron waves a
greeting And as Aaron moves past Lorraine into the room

mother and daughter exchange an unseen look Sharp raw alpost
desperate on Lorraine’s side Julianne’s eyes lower She follows
Aaron in

INT PARENTS’ APARTMENT - LATER

Tea and crumb cake Held on laps in a parlor of print sofas Our
view CIRCLES as they chat OS
-33-
AARON (V0)
She was right They were refined
educated And despite a certain
stiffness easy to be with

Lorraine pours another cup for Aaron

THOMAS
Tell me Aaron why do you
take photographs
Lorraine shoots a disapproving look Her genial mate is a sometine
embarrassment

THOMAS
Is it to immortalize the past
Or stave off the future

A little twinkle with that
AARON
Actually I think it’s a

desperate attempt to cling
to the present

THOMAS
ah the present And what
ds that

LORRAINE

«-please regress to your
obsession with baseball dearest
I‘d rather Aaron found you boring
than odd

Thomas has other ideas

THOMAS
You know you haven’t said a
word yet Aaron About the
neighborhood

JULIANNE
Look at the time My God
we must be going

But she’s smiling As if she has real affection for this old man

THOMAS
Actually we never lived
here Only just moved into
the Brownstone

AARON
The Brownstone
v4
THOMAS
That’s what they call the
puilding It seemed the
logical choice for us

Seeing Aaron’s confusion

LORRAINE
our plane was forced down near
Chicago People were killed
That kind of thingmakes one
reassess

And smiles and sips her tea
LORRAINE
Who knows how long well be
here

a private glance toward her daughter Julianne is looking away
But we know she’s heard

INT PAUL’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Key turns in the door It opens Julianne leading Aaron into the
darkened apartment Her back still to him as

AARON
Now can we talk

And she turns Her body is just against him When he sees her
eyes all thoughts leave him Because this is the moment

Re leans to kiss her mouth and she answers with a sudden
HUNGER Violent rhythmic and yet surpassingly warm Slowly now
she draws him

down to the floor kissing his mouth his face his hair His
foot reaches to SLAM the door closed behind them Right there at
the threshold they wind their limbs around each other

There to stay awhile

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

A large upturned sombrero Our angle SHIFTS to reveal the Bullet
sleeping neatly curled up in the crown PAN to Aaron sitting in
bed His eyes are locked in the dizzying whirlpool of his
thoughts until

Julianne enters she wears a flannel nightgown buttoned to the
throat More beautiful than ever As she crawls up onto the bed

JULIANNE
That smile What is it
In his pain and love he locks at her Softly
AARON
I have to grin sometimes
I’m coming apart

She touches his hair

AARON
Since the morning before I met
you The train ride I’ve
been losing sy mind

She doesn’t protest Just the picture of compassion

listen

AARON
Thingsprobably very explainable
thingsseem like a series of
nightmares

He shrugs Confused that

AARON
---Omly I’m not scared I should
bebut it’s likethe logic of
a drean

JULIANNE

everyone but you

Yen like that Just like that

JULIANNE

INT CHILDHOOD HOME - NIGHT

Once more Aaron’s DREAM He is eight years old clicking ON his
flashlight as he creeps down Christmas morning Around the
corner into

-the living room The tree The presents Closer closer the
flashlight beam playing across the surface of the packages The
child’s face ravenous to devour every detail every nuance of shape
and bulk The bicycle the round package kneel to touch it as
the sound makes hin

WHIRL startled to see

framed in the doorway a WOMAN Her slender body wrapped in a
flannel robe There is a steaming cup in her hand Her face even
in this light is lovely And as she smiles

INT BEDROOM - MORNING

Aaaron wakes with a GASP his bedy JOLTING halfway off the
pillow FREEZING to see

Julianne Just opening the curtains

JULIANNE
Bad dream baby

Soft words She’s dressed in a crisp suit It is businesslike and
sexy When he doesn’t answer

JULIANNE
Tell ne

But he’s just frozen Immobile

JULIANNE
Tell me please

Gently coaxing

JULIANNE
Tell me what scared you it‘1l
do you good

Walking toward him now

JULIANNE
Believe ne I know

His lips are parted But no sound comes
JULIANNE
Say it

Sharp startling For some reason he cannot name taars stand in
his eyes She is there now just above him

JULIANNE
It’s all right Another tine

That was scothing She stares down sorry that she tried to
startle the secret from hin

JULIANNE
My grandma used to say If
you tell your nightmare before
breakfast

(smiles)
-it won’t come back

But he can’t tell her She sees that now And sc
JULIANNE
Breakfast’s on the table I
hope you like it I worked hard
Something in her eyes has him very alert She noves to the door

AARON
You‘re going out

JULIANNE
Away For awhile

The words a stake through his soul

JULIANNE
I love you Aaron

Her eyes mean this And more
JULIANNE
I’ve never said that to
another Ban
A shrug Of helplessness

JULIANNE
I never will

And gone Heels on the hardwood Taking her away Somewhere far
off a door opens Closes He is alone

INT KITCHEN - MORNING

Breakfast on the table counters everywhere It looks like
breakfast for ten Waffles sausage fruit eggs

AARON (V0)
It was the most beautiful
breakfast of course I
couldn’t touch a bite

Keep PANNING the spreadbacon French toast different eggs acre
fruit fresh baked muffins and croissants three xinds of juice

AARON (V0)
I thought well I11 always
leave it there Sort of a
shrine

coffee enough for a week With coffee cake beside it

AARON (V0)
Then I realized that was
excessive

PULL BACX to see him focusing his Nikon

AARON (V0)
I’d just snap off eight nine
rolls Hang the blow-ups on
my wall

He begins CLICK-CLICK CLICK-CLICK circling the table The phone
RINGS He doesn’t seem to hear it Zooming in for a close-up on
the eggs benedict choosing a better angle but it keeps RINGING
So he punches the speaker button goes back to work

AARON
Yah Paul DeGraff’s residence

VOICE (0S)
-«-not recently

And Aaron stops The man’s voice sounds a little like

AARON
- Paul

PAUL (0S)
How’s it goin’ pal

The voice tries to sound easy but there’s an underlying tension
Aaron doesn’t notice

AARON
How’s Paris

PAUL Oh it’s a heck of a town

Aaron close on a bow of blood oranges which have been peeled and
sectioned Fach segment laid out in a delicate arrangement
740-

AARON

AARON

Almost a chuckle with

HOLD on Aaron And hold And hold
EXT STREET - DAY

VIEW from above as Aaron comes hurriedly DOWN the steps of his
building fights through the cross-flow of pedestrians looking
wildly to

HAIL a cab and as it SWERVES to the curb across the street
Aaron PLUNGES into traffic but is stopped by the HONKING
unyielding flow which blocks his view of

the passenger exiting the far side of our cab It is PAUL
still holding an open cellular phone as he

-bDlends into the street crowd Watches unseen as Aaron jumps
into the cab speeds off And Paul stares after hin

-snaps his phone SHUT Small world
EXT CEMETERY - NIGHT

Taxi rolls up to an old cemetery and Aaron is out the door before
the cab fully stops Thrusts some bills through the cabbie’s
window

AARON
Wait okay I’11 be back

Crosses under a street lamp and onto a small cemetery Ancient
headstones spreading trees Patches in utter darkness others lit
in varying degrees of shadow by the surrounding street lights
Aaron passes between two stately headstones with dates in the
1780’s And is gone in darkness
o43-
ANGLEa row with small plaques instead of headstones The graves
lie beneath a line of slender trees which filter and partially
block the ambient light Aaron walking head down seening
scarcey to look at the dimly illuminated names untilne stops
Beside our tree stares down with empty eyes

AARON (V0)
I knew of course there would
be an explanation

He clears his throat His hands absently rub each other

AARON (VO)
Twin sisters Or something less
exotic Maybe the photo was
doctored or switched or

VIEW of the engraving JULIANNE POTTER 1966-1998 And CLOSE now
on Aaron’s face

AARON (V0)
--something else

He looks up at the night sky Mind racing behind his eyes
struggling against the overload

AARON (V0)
No problem Just go find out

And then down to the gravestone The name Of the woman he loves
Ye touches the stone with such feeling

AARON
whoever was here poor woman
IT saw she could use some flowers

EXT CEMETERY - NIGHT
Aaron climbing back into the waiting cab He shuts the door
Stares at the hands in his lap dazed confused trying to hold
himself together The cabbie says nothing
AARON

Back to my place West eighty-

first just off the park
And the driver turns all the way around sixty and brawny Slavic
features He is the SAME DRIVER who once picked up our anorexic
girls Stares intensely strangely But Aaron doesn’t notice
His only thought

AARON (V0)
She’s out there I’1l1l find her

And the cabbie has turned around They drive off As they do
a WINO watches them drive away From his POV
The drivers seat Looks empty

Stepped at a light on Park Avenue

DRIVER
Personally I never listen

Green light the driver eases off down the avenue

DRIVER
« pretty ones they’re the worst
Tossing their hair moving their
bodies just a little just right

The cab starts to pick up speed

DRIVER

SAILING through a RED LIGHT we see the OLD WOMAN on the traffic
island hesitarcly step

AARON
WATCH IT

-DIRECTLY in our path and we CRACK INTO her with our left bumper
sending her SPINNING sideways arms wide a look of tremendous
surprise and fear on her face somehow keeping her balance in the
spin like a crazy endless dance

AARON
Christ you hit that woman
you could have killed her

PETERSAK
-wouldn’t be the first
time Mac

Aaron can only blink at that All sound fades now all sight
becomes a blur Only Petersak’s gentle smile and even voice

PETERSAK
wouldn’t be the first
time Mac

And he wheels smoothly around a corner He’s driving slowly now
perfectly cruising to a stop beside a fashionable apartment
building Central Park is half a block away

PETERSAK
Someone inside You wanna
talk to

A meaningful look Like he knows what he’s talking about His
shoulders tremble in a gentle spasm

PETERSAK
Wanna talk to

EXT APARTMENT - NIGHT

Aaron waiting at a door Tighter than ever As it opens his
breath catches slightly before he sees

GERALD Six years old and angel-blond Pale eyes groomed
hair a perfect little outfit And a cat’s SCRATCH across his
face red and terribly angry Gerald’s eyes are frozen in
apprehension And in spite of his own confusion and despair Aaron
sinks to the floor to be Gerald’s size Smiles

AARON
Hi

‘ GERALD

And seeing Aaron’s gentleness the child relaxes A little
“46-

AARON
Do you know Matthew the

The boy SPASMS once As if a shiver runs through hin
AARON

And the bey grins back Aaron takes his hand

AARON
Matthew talks like that

GERALD
They all do

And tugs Aaron after him Down a hall with gilt paper past
victorian rooms to the parlor Someone is waiting sipping wine
the middle-aged psychic from the train Aaron stunned to see her

MADELINE
Hello Aaron I see you’ve

Gerald leads him to a chair Aaron sits slowly his shock becoming
a realization Maybe she can help Cautiously

AARON
He’s a good-looking guy How
long has he had that scratch

MADELINE
Leng enough

Her child goes to her We see the affection between then
AARON
It looks infected You should
take him to a doctor
MADELINE
Oh I did But not in tine

A terrible sadness in that despite her brave smile Aaron’s heart
goes out to her But he has his own agenda

AARON
PleaseI need some answars I

The desperation brings her eyes up

AARON
I think maybe I’m going crazy

She stares back with quiet compassion ‘Then

MADELINE
Have you encountered certain
people who aredisturbingly
odd I mean recently I
mean other than me

The smile is rueful

MADELINE
For I assure you Aaron If

Her small sigh
MADELINE
which distinguishes ze From
the rest of then
My God of course Of course

MADELINE
Scary isn’t it

de can only blink at such a question

AARON
Nah

His mind racing new tumbling

MADELINE
My Sight began when I was five
on a beach But I can only see
a few of them So compared to

Compared to you Watching that sink in She reaches now to
stroke her child

MADELINE

Helps

MADELINE

His shock confusion

AARON
-’‘less’ dead Like it’s a
matter of decree

MADELINE
Yes The degree of attachment
To lite

She watches him struggle

AARON
Attachment Whatwhat is

Reflecting on the frony

MADELINE
That’s apparently the best
It seems to make them last the

AARON
Last Don’t they last How
long can they last

MADELINE
Look I don’t have all the
answers I’m not even dead
And I’m not sure how much they
understand themsel

AARON
--just tell me okay

That was a little sharp

AARON
I’m sorry it’s justtell ze

She wants to She‘’1ll try

MADELINE
After you ‘die’ whatever that
Beans you continue to be present
in this world But the
and the strength of that presence

Gerald has appeared very silently suddenly at Aaron’s side He
carries an armful of stuff But Aaron’s eyes are locked to

MADELINE
---depends not on which attachment
you choose but how strongly you
hold it how desperately you cling
to this world

Gerald kneels at Aaron’s side starts to lay his things out with
little-boy carebaseball glove bat Red Sox cap
MADELINE
The most strongly attached are
so present they have been known
to become visible touchable to
the living

Touchable A sadly murmured

AARON

The loss washing over him She sees it all
MADELINE

The newly dead if they haven’t
learned the rules might visit

in that moment that they suddenly
appear ‘

Gerald sets out a precious box filled with baseball cards He

tugs at Aaron looking up so hopefully

MADELINE
Of course the loved one how
shall I put it

Aaron sorting through the boy’s cards as Gerald watches trembling

slightly

AARON
frTeaks out

MADELINE
--xactly And when the dead
see the terror disorientation
denialthey never do it again

Aaron pulls out a card Nods impressed He and
look A bond that makes Gerald almost glow His

MADELINE
Apparently the most strongly
attached can last quite awhile
Others are gone in a day or so

And his eyes come up fast A day or so
AARON
How do Ihow do you keep them
from going away
Compassion in her eyes Has to tell hin
MADELINE

You can’t Aaron Eventually
they all detach And go away

Gerald share a
twitching stops

nike hearing his own death sentance And just above a whisper

AARON
Go where

MADELINE
They don’t know It’s like
dying is to us the next stage
ef the process

Shaking his head

AARON
Why can’t they just stay

MADELINE
»they can’t hold the attachment
forever Fear frustration
knowing it can’t lastit gets
to them

Gerald tugging at Aaron’s sleeve He’s got the little bat

MADELINE
finally they can’t hang on
Or they just let go

eyes lecked to hers Then he looks down at the boy

MADELINE
Gerald for example is dead
eight months

Gerald takes a batter’s stance For his picture

MADELINE
And for all the things he can
no longer do

Aaron fixing the boy’s stance now Feet apart more aggressive
twist to the torso

MADELINE
he can still love ne

Such tenderness in that Aaron has to stop for a flicker gather
himself Somehow keeps his smile there for this child

MADELINE
S0 we cling to that

Aaron slaps the Red Scx cap on Gerald’s head Fits it just right
Slides the boy’s grip now down the end of the bat Muraurs

AARON
Better for stroking the
long ball

GERALD

The boy neds seriously Aaron’s eyes glisten but he blinks that
away Looks dewn into the boy’s eager face Whispers

AARON
«ewe’ll take ‘em downtown kid

So Gerald digs in Killer stance And Aaron pulls out his Minox
crouches CLICK-CLICK CLICK-CLICK Gerald SWINGS from his heels
Holds the pose eyes looking hopefully CLICK-CLICK Aaron sends
a thumbs up And turns at last

AARON
Do you know Julianne Potter

She wishes she did

MADELINE
I assume she’s dead

AARON
I assume she’s dead

She sees how much this means Gently
MADELINE
The dead are not my crowd Aaren

Hear him CHARGING from room to room doors opening BANGING shut

AARON Black Eyes please

TEARING up the hall to APPEAR in our doorway Breathing hard
Aaron and Bullet exchange dead-on stares

AARON
Okay Where do I look

EXT BRONX - NIGHT

Aaron RUNNING up a bombed-out street oblivious to homeboy eyes he
POUNDS the pitted pavement dodging trash flying UP the steps of
the Brownstone It is boarded up exactly as before With all his
strength he TEARS it open the door CRASHING from its rusted
hinges and he

-BOLTS into the darkened lobby Pinda the staircase In
blackness HEAR him race upward three stairs at a tine

INT EIGHTH FLOOR - NIGHT

The two dim bulbs The silent hallway More than creepy Along
the corridor chest heaving frow the climb Room 806 He knocks
And the door just swings slowly open

-- there is NOTHING No light no furniture no printed wallpaper
Only the dust of a room abandoned for twenty years Aaron can’t
believe it He squints at the number on the door 806 Back in
at the desolate room There is no answer

INT STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Aaron’s silhouette trudging slowly down the ancient staircase
turning the corner of another landing andstopping This hallway
has no bulbs But is illuminated by a brilliant LIGHT pouring from
the doorway of a far room Aaron squinting at it deciding And
then

-nhe heads toward the light Closer closer Eyes wondering what
this could possibly be There now The door to 431 Aaron draws
a breath steps INTO the blinding light to see

- room flooded by DAYLIGHT It seems like the parlor of a
rustic farmhouse Crude furniture some well-preserved antiques
A spinning wheel At the far end of the roon

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Aaron coming out of Willie’s room into the hallway Quietly
closing the door behind him he heads toward the staircase and

stops A new door is open Just a crack A shard of brilliant
LIGHT glares from within room 409 Aaron staring at the door

This wasn’t open when he came A fear he can’t quite identify
flickers across his face

and then He OPENS the door stepping THROUGH it to

the erest of a SNOW-PATCHED HILL It’s astonishing Above his
a crystal sky A chill wind blows He looks below him now

and field of WINTER TREES naked delicate exquisite And dotted
all along the snow-patched ground

GRAVESTONES Aaron’s ayes light with obvious recognition and
wonder This can’t be true His feet carry him down now into the
cemetery as

CRACK ‘The noise makes him TURN There in a cluster of naked
trees
-56-
an open GRAVE The aound of earth waiting A simple wooden
CASKET stands on the catafalque waiting for gravediggers to cone

and lower the coffin to its rest Aaron stares nearly overcone
with emotion he

goes TOWARD it now stumbling a little closer closer until

---he could reach out and touch it And in a heartbeat his hand
ss reaching reachingand stopping Just short of the casket an
inch away He trembles And

- backs away One etep Two A last look turning

-heading back through the trees our view following his path
toward the doorway to room 409 which appears as a black
rectangular HOLE set against the winter landscape and as he
qoes

our angle ROTATES Past the silent casket in a slow PAN to
sea

--there crouched behind a tree Paul Flint-hard eyes A
satisfaction so profound in its cruelty it admits only the
slightest wisp of a twisted smile

EXT AARON’S BUILDING - NIGHT

Aaron getting out of his cab in the rain Byes dazed lost not
even noticing that he’s getting soaked As he zeaches the steps to
his buildingthere is Bullet Staring back in the rain Aaron
just blinks

AARON
I leave the door open

Bullet doesn’t answer He stands up Walks slowly off kind of
looking back at us Aaron starts after him but as he glances
across the streethe stops cold Nearing the corner moving
quickly through the flow of pedestrians is

AARON
PAUL PAUL

But the words are lost in rain and distance and street noise Paul
turns the corner and Aaron BOLTS after him INTO the street
DODGING a skidding Mercedes to the other side around the corner
and

nothing Look in all directions Gone And back at Aaron’s
building the Bullet stands locking in the other direction down
the block to

and figure in a raincoat standing by a stone stairwell Too far
away to distinguish The Bullet looks somentarily back toward
Aaron Starts trotting up the block
“57 -
IXT STONE STAIRWELL - NIGHT

face Wraps her coat to protect him from the rain Murnurs

JULIANNE
» -how’s our friend huh you

She takes a better look now running slender fingers through his

a HAND reaches from behind TOUCHES her hair and she SCREAMS
WHIRLS to see Aaron down on the pavement with her Very close

He stares at her Ina way he never has before So loving so
intense It frightens her And seeing this

Re reaches his arms around her
Holds her so tight So dear
Kisses her head Then pulls away But only inches
AARON
I have a secret But I’n
afraid to tall you
Her eyes searching his face Why
AARON
Because Im scared That when
you learn the truth about me

His hands find her rain-soaked hair Move it tanderly back behind
her shoulders

AARON
-you won’t love me anymore
58-

She doesn’t understand So he comes even closer Their iips now
oniy inches apart Murpurs

floods down over his face

JULIANNE (05S)
Youre very quiet

PULL BACK to see he lies in a tub His head tilted back on the
vim Julianne kneels over him from just behind the tub Wearing
enly one of his dress shirts She’s bathing him with a sponge

JULIANNE
fou’re angry I didn’t teli you

And without turning

AARON

He doesn’t look angry Only tense worried

JULIANNE
Howd you find out

He closes his eyes

AARON
Paul called from Paris He
told me he killed you

JULIANNE
And what else

Said lightly But her eyes are not light at all

AARON
God there’s more

Instead of an answer she squeezes sponge water over his face He
grins now and licks some up She kisses his head

AARON
How come some of the people I
meet are so different fron
each other
JULIANNE
You zean from ne

He does

AARCN

JULIANNE
»- unraveled

AARON
That’s the word huh

SULIANNE
That’s what we do We unravel

She strokes his face His eyes are closed but we can see her love
for him And how auch it hurts her

JULIANNE
The zore we detach the wore
we twitch and spasm anda
lot of gruesome stuff at the end

She said that soft enough But it brings his eyes to her sorry
he’s asked She just goes on about her work soaping his
shoulders his chest

JULIANNE
You’ve seen the repeating Words
actions Whole littleepisodes
sometimes

Rinsing nim with care

JULIANNE
Were trying to hang on then
Desperate Clinging to our most
important thing or most familiar
Whatever attaches us or

(beat)
Who the hell dees your hair

She‘s picking at it Repelled
AARON
Youve seen dead men with
better haircuts

JULIANNE
Dead dogs Yours included

On her feet Going to the medicine chest
ARRON

eeall I meant vas Some of
them seen so normal
JULIANNE
deing dead ig normal Aaron

At the cabinet rummaging through

JULIANNE
In fact if you define normal
as something that applies to
everyone

Finds two scissors

JULIANNE
-getting dead is the only
normal thing there is

One is big and straight ‘The small one is curved HOLD on her as
she’s choosing

AARON (0S)
The thing is you expect the
dead to all be the same So
the variety is a little dazzling

The big one she decides

AARON (0S)
You’ve got these poor souls
who seem like mechanical dolls
all the way up to

He stops And quietly

JULIANNE
you can say it Aaron All
the way up to me

Staring at the scissors Staring hard
JULIANNE
I’m what we call high-
functioning

A sticky white substance trickles from a corner of her mouth She
licks at it

JULIANNE
But we can turn sour real
fast
Her finger absently flicks the last of the white away She heads
back with her scissors
AARON
What would do that

No snile in his voice now Very straight question She kneels
down behind his
JULIANNE
Sadness detaches us And
ionelinessregret

Shes plucking his hair Sizing up the job
JULIANNE
Fear is the worst That’s
what gets us in the end

AARON
What can help

“S1l-

He’s trying to see her But she holds his head still from behind

JULIANNE
Love and anger

Love and anger

JULIANNE
They are completely equal Any
passion makes us pore present

She snips at a lock of hair Still tentative

AARON
Are you ever present enough
for people to

JULIANNE
-8ee me Let’s put it
this way

Snips again A little bolder

JULIANNE
If we made love in Macy’s window
you’d look pretty silly for awhile
And in the right moment

(snip)
80 would I

She’s cutting away now fast Fearlessly
AARON
Isn’t all this hair gonna
screw up the drain
The clippings drift onto the water in a fine sprinkle

AARON
Then again It’s Paul’s drain

JULIANNE
-80 Now we’re even

He chuckles Looks back up into her smile His hands reach and
GRASP her suddenly PLIP her SCREAMING over his head and CRASH into

scapy water Silent for an instant while she’s under

Then
-SUrlaces SHRIEKING louder than ever SWINGING wildly at
with her eyes closed he’s reaching in TICKLING her withou
until she dissolves in laughter and he

-holds her tight Wipes the hair and wet from her face w
strong hands And when the dark eyes open

JULIANNE
How the hell Are you ever
gonna live without me

They both know the answer No way at all
AARON
How can I imagine something
A billion years from now

And just above a whisper

AARON
Listen up Here’s the rules

He smiles With all the confidence he can pretend

NT BEDROOM LATE NIGHT

Bed aoonlight She’s curled so comfortably against his chest
her eyes closed His are alert trying to figure

AARON
So what makes live people see you
is it always the 8

she never opens hers

JULIANNE
-you know what time it is

drowsy dreamy But it just reminds him of another question

AARON
-do you really sleep

JULIANNE
Only when you stop talking
it’s four o’clock

AARON
Okay it’s my first day
nave a couple of questions

She xisses jis chest But her eyes stay closed
JULIANNE
When you hit three thousand
you have to shut up
All right He‘il be selective

AARON
How close am 1

JULIANNE
That’s it

And she rolls into a ball at his side Nesties into him like she’s
hibernating for the winter But he’s thinking now The one thing
he’s been holding back

AARON
I went to your folks’ apartzent
looking for you
That opens her eyes

JULIANNE
Really

A little stiff with that He doesn’t notice Too absorbed with
his recollection of the Brownstone Says only

AARON

I love the way you are with
then So close
64-

But there’s something more benind his eyes She’s watching this

closely almost knowingly

JULIANNE
What What is it

That was very soft He shakes his head nothing

Back to

JULIANNE
Well my folks and I We aren’t

Close at all

JULIANNE
The night I brought you over
The first time Id seen then
In sixteen years

Sixteen years She watches his astonishment

JULIANNE
I ran away at fourteen They
loved me all right They
just didn’t love each other

Anger and sadness And nore hurt than she can count up

JULIANNE
After all those years They
flew out to stay with ne and
this guy I was living with

Can you believe

JULIANNE
-and the plane crashed
That’s how they died
She tries a shrug The ironies of fate Then

JULIANNE
So You had a good visit

Shes watching his tension rise once more
AARON
They were out More than out
there wasnothing there The
room was

He stops Troubled confused

JULIANNE
They carry it with thes
She didn’t expect he’d get that

gqguardedly

She lets it go
- -—- -

Silence

More silence

55-
JULIANNE
It’s a room that helps then
attach That was their parlor
in Madison Wisconsin Where
I grew up

AARON
But I could see it I sat on
the couch

JULIANNE
The strength of their attachment
Bakes the room present At least
in the Brownstone that’s why a
ict of them live there

JULIANNE
In the talkthe Brownstone
igs ‘easy to furnish’

JULIANNE
it’s an empty vessel Been
abandoned so long Nothing to
anterfere with what they bring
to it

dis eyes are strange now Intent staring

Pauses

Sure he nods

JULIANNE
So they bring their past
They call it ‘decorating’

JULIANNE
-you okay

I’m fine

JULIANNE
It can be any size Sometines
it’s an exteriora mountain
anything It ali fits in the
room because it’s inside then

AARON
IT saw I saw a horse ranchand

She watches his struggle Once more her gaze seens somehow

knowing

JULIANNE
-and what baby

But as auch as he wants to he can’t tell her about the graveyard
“66-
AARON
and it was amazing Sky
rolling hills horses
And then
AARON
Just being in that building

Could it make youimagine
someplace As if you were there

She pauses thinking ‘Then shrugs

JULIANNE
I don’t know maybe

Watching him Sends a sweet suile
JULIANNE
You checking out Is this

He closes his eyes
AARON
It is the coolest Thing
Ever
End of discussion He rolls over as if to sleep HOLD on her
Still watching
INT CHILDHOOD HOME - NIGHT
Aaron’s dream The little boy crouched by his presents The
mother standing in the doorway Steaming cup Lovely smile A
frozen moment and
-she comes toward him Slowly almost carefully As if there is
thought in every step Just as she reaches him she flicks on a
three-way lamp To the dimmest setting

MOTHER
Just want to see your face

The voice is soft and lovely as the smile But there is the
slightest catch in it She crouches down

AARON
Do I have to go back to bed

MOTHER
You have to drink your chocolate

And she hands his the cup Se grins

AARON
Why

MOTHER
Because © made it

Sits beside him Hands him the drink He just holds it staring
at her

AARON
Iwas dreaming of ay nother

And Julianne nods Supportive interestad But not pushing it

AARON
The last time I saw her

Just the way he says that The hurt for him comes straight to her
eyes

AARON
It was Christmas I got up in

He has to shrug So he won’t cry

AARON
In the norning we opened my

When I went out to play she
shot herself

He can’t understand Can’t understand at all

AARON

She nods maybe But it’s not what she’s thinking Asks
JULIANNE
Did you see anybody Anyone

He shakes his head No he didn’t She seems to toss it off just
wondering that’s all
JULIANNE
Will you talk to me About
Christuas
That brings him right to the edge She reaches fast for his hand

Winds her fingers tight They sit like that Locked in each
others eyes

SULIANNE
You thought it was your fault

Very very zoft

JULIANNE
Your love Wasn’t good enough
to save her

He’s choking back the feeling now Because she’s right

churning it lumbers along toward us And when it passes we

Zlat gray PISTOL Munching walking he checks the clip fits
a silencer onto the muzzle Raises it

Julianne thirty feet ahead Paul releases the safety with a CLICK
and the gun

-Swerves to the left as something distracts Paul’s attention
Pedestrians everywhere but no cone seens to notice still walking

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The Bulist lies in a corner Pensive staring intently at
Julianne She is alone kneeling by a crackling Zire Her bedy is
frozen in the pose of someone dealing cards But there are no
cards to be seen Her eyes stare blankly into the flames In
Aaron’s absence her fear has overcome her

The puppy whimpers it is a sight unnerving even to him But
Julianne does not stir He rises now and trots over Gazes up at
her But she does not breathe And from somewhere

the front door OPENS Clicks shut Julianne blinks and as she
does a card is in her hand Red seven She looks down cards are
now spread before her Plays on the black eight And as Aaron
enters carrying an armload of fast food sacks she vwriggles her
nose at the next card

AARON
Hungry

JULIANNE
how long were you gone

der voice a little shaky His concern immediate

AARON
You okay

He’s xneeling with her setting down the food

JULIANNE
-you don’t have to always
ask that

Her voice is soft She puts up the best smile she can

JULIANNE
I’m not made of glass I’
just dead

He’s looking in her eyes Murmurs

AARON
You‘re frightened huh

Tne dark eyes move across his face

JULIANNE
It goes together a little
(beat)
Leving you And being afraid
of when I lese you

Her little shrug What can I do He wants so much to touch her
comfort her Sut her cues are telling him to play this down So
he glances to the Bullet
AARON
-and what about you I left
you behind to cheer her up

JULIANNE
Well he reads to me But
its always Stephen King

She’s poking around in the fast food

JULIANNE
This one’s ready it’s coming
right through the sack

As she pulls stuff out
AARON
We got Mexican chinese
Italian and burgers

Smile becomes the GRIN the eerie rictus of a corpse her whole

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Julianne SOLTING into the bathroom whirling back LOCKING the
door turning in blind panic to the mirror There is an instant of
stark realization This is it Her body

SPASMS in a JOLT a single electric SHOCK and eyes wild she
LUNGES for the sink but FREEZES in mid-motion A grotesque
mannequin The horror holds Holds Her eyes £111 with panic
and suddenly her frame

TWITCHES she tries to scream but her mouth LOCKS OPEN her
limps her torso now JERKING in short repetitive BURSTS toward the
sink and back and toward it and back a short-circuited wind-up
doll and though her dark eyes are streaming tears

throaty LAUGH begins within her rich and full and even sexy
Her head shakes no no no and with everything in her she LURCHES
GRASPS the rim of the sink in a death grip as from behind her

--POUNDING on the door Aaron’s voice SHOUTING calling to her
and still the unbidden laughter pours from her like eerie music
and her body VIBRATES as if it were an air hammer as if it would
shatter or fly apart and the sink

«eRIPS LOOSE from the wall her slender frame ARCS poised
frighteningly for a single CONVULSION her hands FLY to cover her
nouth staring at her reflection in horror and

from one nostril a milky white substance trickles down across
her hands as the door CRASHES OPEN Aaron’s reflection appears
behind hers and she
-76-
- WHIRLS to him terrified But in the silence whole once nore
Her fingers wipe the milky white from her face

AARON
What sg that stuff

He Looks more frightened than she is She sniffles seiles
somehow

JULIANNE
I don’t know Aaron We
don’t come with a manual

She tries to brush past him to the doorway but he grabe hold of
her and she

flinches from his touch ‘The first time that’s ever happened
And it stops them both His hands come away Her eyes would
rather anything in this world than to have hurt him They flutter
down She Clears her throat

JULIANNE
I justI just need some air

And in the silence

AARON

She turns away heads down the hall He follows She opens the
closet pulls out her jacket

JULIANNE

She slips it on heading for the door The Bullet comes running

Back on Fifth Avenue just as weve seen him before Znd of day
now and he stumbles absently through the crowds

AARON (V0)
I ran all night all day hid
in alleys Where do you go to
hide from a ghost

Staggering on looking in all directions at once

AARON (V0)
I don’t know why I wound up here

And that very thought makas him slow Realize

AARON (V0)
»-sure Ido This was where she
found me last time

and jog-steps to one side We look down to see he had almost
stepped ona smail The tiny creature doggedly crossing the
pavenent Aaron stares at it for a beat Then crouches low his
body something of a shield and gently lifts the snail in his hand
Watches it move

AARON (V0)
I don’t know why I did it

Crosses the sidewalk Sinks down beside the curb
AARON (V0)
I’ve never been a fanatic on
reverence for life

Carefully releases the snail into the gutter As he watches it
inch off his gaze drifts way down the block To where a lumbering
84-

STREETSWEEPER chugs itS way toward us Aaron stares as if sensing
something Mesmer‘zed as the streetsweeper unaccountanly

--pulle straight up ONTO the sidewalk strange It sits there
now rumbiing slightly almost as if breathing And as Aaron
watches the thing

-BURSTS toward us the huge vehicle EXPLODING up the sidewalk
like a demented dragster and people SCREAM DIVE for cover HURL
themselves into the street raw chaos Aaron staring transfixed as
the ROCKETING vehicle is ON him at two hundred miles an hour
and

In the silence a whispered

And down from the cabclimbs Paul DeGraff Slow He’s eating a
big pink cotton candy with deliberate relish Never even looks at
Aaron Like talking to himself
PAUL
The downside of a really great
close call It’s only fun once
Stops for a big lick at the cotton candy

PAUL
Second time You go for it

And then he looks up Straight at Aaron’s eyes
PAUL
Haven’t eaten this shit since
I’m nine

Plucks off a pink patch of sugar Stuffs his zouth Smiles as he
delivers an enigmatic reminder

PAUL

Walk away slow
And as Aaron watches His eyes flickerand flicker again

occurred

MADELINE

She sees how deeply this affects him OSecides to confess

INT WILLIE’S ROOM - NIGHT

The door to 431 stands ajar Light pouring from the hallway into
the darkened abandoned room Filth and neglect and emptiness
everywhere Aaron sits on the floor Scrap of paper Stub of
pencil And as he writes

he hears something A sound Or was it cChillingly quiet row
His eyes flicker And we CUT To

THE MOSAICthe leaves the lamp the woman’s leg Her arm
reaching as the man STEPS across our view We move to see the sard
in her fingers The solitaire hand on the grass And as she plays
her card we now SEE

the man’s HAND RISING into frame Held loosely easily
-104-
-a flat gray PISTOL and we SNAP

BACK co the abandoned room Aaron still as death paper and pencil
forgotten in hig hands And

CRASH Par below main door A frozen moment A jubilant
warbling

AARON
No one on board huh
Only us

JULIANNE

We bring the place The people
Belong to themselves

And he smiles
AARON
Well then We need to elect

The gentle seas rock the room just a little She smiles back

JULIANNE

His snile fades But his eyes stay right with her

AARON
You thought you’d be married

Just above a whisper

AARON
And so you will

She doesn’t understand He turns from her now opens the bar’s
refrigerator Pulls out a beer POPS the top TEARING OFF the
ring He holds it up to her eyes

AARON
By the authority vested in ne
as Captain of this vessel

She looks as if she might cry He gives her a very goofy face
What’s up She giggles sniffles

Stares into her eyes

AARON
Do you Juliannetake Aaron

JULIANNE
tnhis is very unorthodox

AARON
to cherish and protect Ain
in sickness and health To
comfort and encourage him To
forgive him and to give hin
strength when his is gone

Her smile is gone now This has become very serous

AARON
to be part of hiz the best

AARON
Me too I now pronounce us
husband and wife I may kiss
the bride

And slowly he does The one perfect kiss of his life as it
continues his body moves against the woman in his arms and they
are dancing A dreany murmur

JULIANNE
How come no band

They are one bedy now swaying spinning so slowly effortlessly
together He brings his lips to her ear

AARON (singing)
My ship has sails that are
trimmed with silk

Soft thin voice With the dreams of childhood

AARON (singing)
Its decks are made of gold

She holds him forever tight now

AARON (singing)
And of jam and spice
There’s a paradise in the

DARKNESS The room the world plunged into black as Julianne
GASPS still clinging to each other as the ship’s INTERCOM clicks
en Loud Static precedes the rather bored routine voice

PAUL (0S)
---aahh this is the Captain
Like to welcome you all aboard
our aaahhJudgement Day Cruise
one of our least aaahhpopular
holiday excursions

Aaron has her hand now tugging her swiftly through the darkened
ballroom A neon green EXIT

PAUL (0S)
-weve planned our usual
grab bag of surprises

Through the exit into a nearly pitch-black corridor Along the
wall now feeling their way

PAUL --80 just relax kids and
remember to aaahh

-- Aaron at a small doorway He steps through pulling her along
with him

PAUL have fun
-109-
-CLICKS off Simultaneously a green light BLINKS oN in what
they can now see is the ship’s elevator As he turns to her the
doors SLAM SHUT On the panel the button marked G glows green and
bright A frozen instant and the elevator LURCHES into motion
Going up slowly

PAUL (0S)
You’re heading for the galley
kids

Aarons hand stabs the STOP button but the elevator keeps moving

PAUL (03S)
Don’t come too quick I’m
still selecting sy cleaver

SLAM all the buttons now Useless Still rising Aaron WHIRLS
from the buttons eyes and hands searching the walls roof as if
for some hidden panel trap door Julianne near-hysterical
POUNDING the buttons with her fists turns with helpless eyes
as

the car CLANGS to a stop The deck indicator glows G for
galley Their eyes riveted to the door she begins to TWITCH
and his arm slides protectively around her He shivers slightly
himsel’ as we HEAR the door OPEN and together

«they stare in AWE At what we cannot see Until

the first SNOWFLAKES drift into the tiny compartment and we
SNAP TO REVERSE ANGLE

---deep SNOWY WooDS in first light Exquisite dreamlike Flakes
drifting to cover endless trees in their soft blanket And as we
step out hesitantly

-0ur feet CRUNCH deep into snow Through the woods now Aaron
and Julianne holding hands looking around in equal wonder at the
sight of it flakes settling gently on their clothes and hair
Julianne tasting it on her fingers

AARON
Where is this From your
childhood

JULIANNE
I’ve never seen it before or
anything like it

And they look at each other How is that possible Is this a
dream

AARON
Maybe Paul can’t find it

She looks away searching the trees the snow-covered ground as
they go Instinctively huddling closer to him and suddenly
w1ld-

-he stops A huge oak covered with new snow He is looking up
Jp to the tall branches a child’s treenouse Aaron blinks at it
Then turns slowly ag in q dream

t2 a very particular view There in distance between the
trees behind the snow A farmhouse He stares stares and
reaches Toe To the trunk of the huge oak Wiping away the snow
to reveal

--a HEART carved into the bark Freshly cut by the look of it
Two sets of initials mc we A lovers arrow as Julianne

SCREAMS Aaron WHIPPING around to see

-PAUL coming at them through the trees a gigantic CLEAVER in his
bands a frozen instant and Aaron

stalks straight TOWARD Paul

JULIANNE (0S)
AARON NOOOOCO

-and FLINGS his arms WIDE to accept the blow And for the first
time ever

Paul stops Uncertain Cleaver drawn back poised

JULIANNE (05S)
NO PLEEEEASE

Dead at Paul’s eyes a quiet

AARON
Go ahead Pal

Paul conflicted Confusion crazy rage maybe even a little fear

AARON (V0)
The tree made ne realize Only
one person could have redecorated
us to this place

-and Paul SWINGS in blind FURY the CLEAVER SLASHING STRAIGHT
THROUGH Aaron’s body

AARON (V0)
« Ce

Which rewains upright

AARON (V0)
I guess sy first reaction
was relief

Where the cleaver passed through him only a faint silver GLOW
which SHIMMERS and fades

AARON (V0)
Then I felt a little foolish
not to have realized
His hand touches where the nertal wound should be

AARUN (V0)
--Id been dead all along

Paul has backed away stumblirg to his knees in the snow
powerless Aaron turns

--Julianne is frozen watchful But not at all surprised As he
goes to her he sees the distant farshouse through snow and trees
Hears a murmured

JULIANNE (0S)
-«-mOrry Christzas

He looks to the dark eyes

AARON
My father He carved those
initials

JULIANNE

- because he loved her
Yes he did She has to tell him

JULIANNE
See love can’t do everything

Takes nis hands in hers

JULIANNE
It was never supposed to

Her bittersweet smile The look holds And he smiles ack

JULIANNE
Are your folks in that house

They are
AARON
It’s early I think they’re
still sleeping In each other’s
arus

She reaches both hands Touches his dear face

JULIANNE
Well Well let them sleep
Aaron blinks And when his eyes open we are in
EXT CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT
Warm summer’s night A small floedlit clearing Everyones

position resains precisely the same Julianne touching ais face

He’s looking around at the vast skyline Paul crouched in
lamplight staring back with neutral but interested eyes

JULIANNE
Can you remember now

He’s trying With everything in hin
SULIANNE
I was waiting at the edge of
the park For the man I loved
And on his look
JULIANNE
That means you doofus
was waiting for you

SEE it now the FLASHBACK of her story She reads on a bench
beneath a lignt

AARON (0S)
For me

JULIANNE (0S)
Sure I’d left Paul six aonths
before
From out of the shadows behind her a SILHOUETTE appears
JULIANNE (0S)
And then I’d come to you We
were together all that time
The silhouette is Paul And his pistol

JULIANNE (0S)
You were the love of sy life

Paul puts the pistol into her neck as she STARTLES

AARON But Paul was a jealous guy

Her eyes look up Into that crazy overbroad grin
eild-

JULIANNE (05S)
He took me way into the park
that night

SEE them how in this very clearing Julianne terrified kneeling
before Paul’s pistol

JULIANNE (0S
He gave me a pack of cards

At gunpoint Julianne opens the deck deals out the hand

JULIANNE There had been same gang aurders
in the park The victims were
found with a solitaire hand

And slowly tears streaming she begins to play the cards
JULIANNE (0S)
Crips and Bloods topping each
other Depending on whether
the last card
Red seven On the black eight

JULIANNE (0S)
-was red or black

Paul’s pistol RISES now into frame Aimed at her
SULIANNE (0S)
So when he killed me the
police would think
And she stops at the next card Her nose wriggles sensing

“JULIANNE (0S)
And then you found ne

EXT §OODS NIGHT

de have seen these yvoods this huge oak before 3ut only in snow
The snow of Christmas Tonight moonlight blankets all as winter
had once long ago And we HEAR

the CAR pull up See the two figures get out walk hand-in-
nand To the oak

The carved initials are faded smooth But despite the years in
the noonlignt we see them The heart The arrow

The proof That love once lived here
AARON
I’a glad we came If only
for this
His fingers touch the wood she murmurs
JULIANNE
You can’t give up We drove all
this way
She nestles into him His eyes stay on the carving
JULIANNE
Mine stayed for me Waiting To
set things right

He nods absently Yes they did

and family at a Christmas table It is heaped with food shining
with candles We see the tree the presents wrapped with love
where they have always been

And as our family eats as they talk in excited bursts as the men
watch the women vith such pride

-We pull AWAY slowly from this room out through the window The
farmhouse is lit now from within ‘The woods from above As the
peace the rightness the eternal nature of it all settles on us
