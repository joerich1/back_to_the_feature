March 16

A vast and sparkling starfield A pinpoint of LIGHT

appears and starts moving toward the camera

a small

and distant cylindrical object tumbling end over end

but we cant determine exactly what it is yet

undulating sea of wheat We become aware
are two HEADS sticking out of the stalks of
men are standing and looking up at the

move towards them we begin to hear their
conversationand we can see that the two men are

CHEKOV
(points to sky)
There he is -- there to the
South
SCOTTY

(peers upward)
What are ye blind Thats a
bird
are up at the sky

(VEX-I)

The cylinder tumbling through space is now closer and

we can now see that it is a BOTTLE of some sort
is tumbling directly toward the camera

EXT WHEATFIELD- DAY

and it
As before Chekov and Scotty staring at the sky

SCOTTY
(concerned)
Repelling the Crystalline
Trench rafting down lava
flows orbital skydiving its

like the man is running a bloody
decathlon across the galaxy

Suddenly we hear a double SONIC BOOM

CHEKOV
(re sound)
That should be him now I think
hes just crossed the sound
barrier

They shield their eyes against the sun and look up

EXT SPACE (VFX-I)

The bottle gets CLOSER

EXT WHEATFIELD - DAY

A man in a high-tech body harness and parachute LANDS
in the wheat flat on his back His body-suit is
charred scorched wisps of smoke still curling off of
it There are small thrusters attached to his backpack
and boots Scotty and Chekov move to him The man
removes his helmet Revealing that it is KIRK He
smiles broadly like a child who has just come off a
roller-coaster

KIRK
Right on target I jump out over
the Arabian Peninsula and I end

up here right on the dime
Kirk gets to his feet

CHEKOV
Actually Captain your precise
target area was thirty-five
meters
(points)
That way

KIRK
Thanks for pointing that out

Kirk starts to pull off his suit reacts to a sudden
pain in his back

KIRK
Oh

SCOTTY
Ive warned ye about that back of
yours You should have a doctor
take a look at it

Kirk waves him away and continues to remove his
harness

EXT SPACE (VFX-I)

The tumbling bottle rushes past and we can now see
that it is a CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE - Dom Perignon 2265
Follow the bottle as it tumbles through space

EXT WHEATFIELD - DAY

Kirk Scotty and Chekov as before

KIRK
Tomorrow I want to make a tri-
elliptical jump Thats where you
jump out over Northern China and
make three complete orbits before
you start re-entry

CHEKOV
Captain Perhaps you have
forgotten that tomorrow is the
christening ceremony

This strikes a nerve with Kirk -- we see a flash of
hesitation and irritation cross his face

KIRK
Im not going
(beat)
Scotty help me with this chute

SCOTTY
What do you mean youre not
going We promised

KIRK
When I retired I swore Id never
set foot on a starship again and
I meant it

EXT SPACE (VFX-I)

The champagne bottle SMASHES onto the bow of a
Federation starship(Excelsior class) sitting in its
dock in orbit around Earth

EXT SPACE (VFX-I)

FOLLOW the shards of glass from the bottle as they
spread over the shiprevealing the name on the hull
USS ENTERPRISE NCC-1701-B

ANGLE ON SPACEDOCK WINDOW

A large picture window overlooking the starship in its
berth The window is filled with people in Starfleet
uniforms applauding the christening of the ship (but
we hear nothing)

INT SPACEDOCK OBSERVATION ROOM (VFX-I)

The people are still applauding and we can see that
they are looking out over the ship in its berth

EXT SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B IN SPACEDOCK (VFX-I)

The great ship sits in spacedock

INT ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE

CLOSE ON A SET OF TURBOLIFT DOORS as they slide open to
reveal Kirk Scotty and Chekov A bright light shines
into their faces and they react MOVE TO REVEAL -

that the bright light is coming from a futuristic
CAMERA with a small bank of lights attached to it The
camera is a holographic recorder with two lenses and is
worn on an operators head There are four JOURNALISTS
clustered in front of the Turbolift -- one associated
with the camera the others using PADDS to make
notations

Also clustered around the door are the BRIDGE CREW of
the Enterprise-B Everyone is APPLAUDING as Kirk and
the others blink under the bright lights and ENTER the
Bridge

JOURNALISTS
(overlapping)
Captain Kirk how does it feel
to be back on the Enterprise

Bridge Captain can I have a
Minute Captain Scott do you
have any comment on Commander
Chekov etc

CAPTAIN JOHN HARRIMAN pushes through the crowd

HARRIMAN
Excuse me excuse methere will
be plenty of time for questions

later

The journalists edge away and the cameraman moves to
get a good angle

HARRIMAN
(continuing to all)
Im Captain John Harriman Id
like to welcome you all aboard

KIRK
Its our pleasure

Harriman is young confident eager -- this is his
first command and he takes it very seriously

HARRIMAN

I just want you to know how
excited we all are to have a group
of living legends with us on our
maiden voyage

(beat)
I remember reading about your
missions when I was in grade
school

The original Enterprise officers all stop and give him
a look Harriman looks a little embarrassed -- he
didnt mean to insult them But Kirk gives him a
little smile lets it roll off

KIRK

Well may we have a look around
HARRIMAN

Please please

Chekov sees someone in the background calls out to
her

CHEKOV
Demora

Chekov moves off
JOURNALIST
(breezy)
So Captain this is the first
Starship Enterprise in thirty
years without James T Kirk in
command How do you feel about
that

The Journalist has unknowingly touched a nerve Kirks
eyes flash for a moment -- the longer hes on this
Bridge the more he realizes he doesnt feel good about
it at all He tries to shrug it off with a smile

KIRK
Just fine Im glad to be here to
send her on her way

He tries to move away from the Journalist who dogs
him

JOURNALIST
What have you been doing since you
retired

KIRK
Ive been keeping busy

At this point Chekov approaches with a young (mid-
twenties) attractive Asian female Ensign named DEMORA

CHEKOV
(to Kirk)
Excuse me Captain Id like you
to meet the Helmsman of the
Enterprise-B Ensign Demora Sulu --
Captain James Kirk

DEMORA
Its a pleasure to meet you sir
My fathers told me some
interesting stories about you

Kirk is shocked For a long moment he stares at her
in amazement

KIRK
Your father Hikaru Sulu is your
father

DEMORA
Yes sir

CHEKOV

You met her once before but she
was
Chekov holds out his hand and indicates a very

height

KIRK
But that wasnt so long ago it
couldnt have been more than

CHEKOV
Twelve years sir

KIRK
Yes well congratulations
Ensign It wouldnt be the
Enterprise without a Sulu at the
helm

DEMORA
Thank you sir
(to Chekov)
Let me show you the new inertial
guidance system

short

Demora and Chekov move off and Kirk looks after them

for a long beat

from shock to sadness Something is clearly
bothering him

Scotty moves over to Kirk with a smile on his

But Kirks mind is still on Demora

she moves

Kirk nods

SCOTTY
(to Kirk)
Damn fine ship if you ask me

to the Helmsmans position

KIRK
You know Scotty it amazes me

SCOTTY
And what would that be sir

KIRK
Sulu When did he find the time
for a family

SCOTTY
Its like you always said -- if
somethings important enough you
make the time

absently Scotty realizes something

SCOTTY
So thats why youve been
running around the galaxy like an
eighteen-year-old Finding

The expression on his face changes

face

He watches her as

retirement a little lonely are we
Kirk gives him a look

KIRK
With that kind of tact Im glad
youre an engineer and not a
psychiatrist

Harriman interrupts

HARRIMAN
Excuse me gentlemen if youll
take your seats

KIRK
Oh of course

NEW ANGLE

Revealing that three CHAIRS have been neatly arranged
to one side

Scotty Kirk and Chekov all take their seats The
Journalists take positions on the opposite side of the
Bridge Harriman moves to the command chair and the
rest of the Bridge crew go to their stations

HARRIMAN

(to all)
Prepare to leave spacedock Aft
thrusters ahead one quarter port
and starboard at station keeping

(beat)
Captain Kirk Id be honored if
you would give the order to get

underway
KIRK
No no Thank you
HARRIMAN

Please I insist

All eyes on Kirk -- he has little choice He stands
uncomfortably There is a moment of anticipation

KIRK
(to all)
Take us out

Everyone breaks into APPLAUSE Kirk sits down in
acute embarrassment and annoyance

CHEKOV
(sotto)
TO

Very good sir
SCOTTY

(sotto)
Brought a tear to my eye

EXT SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)

The great ship majestically LEAVES the dock and heads

out into open space passing DIRECTLY OVERHEAD

INT ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE

A short time later Harriman turns to his guests

HARRIMAN

Well weve just cleared the
asteroid belt Our course will
take us out beyond Pluto and then
back to spacedock Just a quick
run around the block

(beat)
If we have time well conduct a
few tests of the warp --

Suddenly the communications console starts to BEEP
The COM OFFICER hits a few commands in response

COM OFFICER
(to Harriman)
Were picking up a distress call
Captain

This grabs everyones attention

HARRIMAN
On speakers

We hear the voice of a crewmember who sounds panicked

and urgent

COM VOICE
(fritzed)
This is the transport ship Lakul
Were caught in some kind of
energy distortion We cant break
free need immediate help
It tearing us --

The voice is drowned out by STATIC The SCIENCE
OFFICER checks something on his console The
Journalist with the Holo-camera turns on his light

and

Cur

pans it around to capture the action

SCIENCE OFFICER
The Lakul is one of two ships
transporting El-Aurian refugees to
Earth

Harriman blinks a couple of times surprised at this
unexpected turn of events Kirk watches him intently
Harriman clears his throat then turns to Demora

HARRIMAN
Can you locate them

DEMORA

The ships are bearing at three one
zero mark two one five Distance
Three light years

HARRIMAN

Signal the closest starship
Were in no condition to mount a
rescue We dont even have a
full crew aboard

The NAVIGATOR checks his console

NAVIGATOR
Were the only one in range sir

The Holo-camera light is shined on Harriman as he
shifts in his seat hesitant to take the plunge Kirk
is drumming his fingers impatiently on his leg
Finally Harriman takes a breath and straightens his
jacket a bit

HARRIMAN
Well then I guess its up to
us
(to Demora)
Helm lay in an intercept course
and engage at maximum warp

Kirk fidgets in his chair itching to get in on the
action - his instincts taking over Scotty shoots him
a side-long glance
SCOTTY
Is there something wrong with your
chair Captain

Kirk gives him a look

EXT SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)

The ship snaps into warp
14 INT ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE

A few minutes later Demora is watching her console

DEMORA
Were within visual range of the
energy distortion Captain

HARRIMAN
On screen

15 INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I)

Which now shows a HUGE RIBBON OF CRACKLING ENERGY
directly ahead of the Enterprise-B

Everyone reacts to the bizarre sight

CHEKOV
What the hell is that

DEMORA
(off console)
Ive found the transport ships

15A INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I)
15A

The Viewscreen now shows TWO TRANSPORT SHIPS trapped
like insects in the violent torrent of energy The
ships are being buffeted and thrown about by large
TENDRILS of CRACKLING ENERGY

DEMORA
(contd)
Their hulls are starting to buckle
under the stress -- they wont

survive much longer

The ship suddenly SHAKES The Navigator works his
console

NAVIGATOR
Were encountering severe
gravimetric distortions from the
energy ribbon

HARRIMAN
Well have to keep our distance
we dont want to get pulled in
too

Harriman frowns at the screen trying to figure out
what to do Kirk can barely contain himself -- to him
the answer is obvious He blurts out the answer --

KIRK
Tractor beam

Scotty quickly elbows him in the side -- this isnt
Kirks ship Kirk shuts up Harriman glances at Kirk

HARRIMAN
We dont have a tractor beam

KIRK
You left spacedock without a
tractor beam

HARRIMAN
It wont be installed until
Tuesday
(beat)
Ensign Sulu try generating a
subspace field around the ships
That might break them free

DEMORA
Aye sir

When Kirk hears this order he shakes his head slightly
and mouths the word no under his breath He knows
that wont work

DEMORA
(continuing shakes her
head)
Theres too much quantum
interference Captain

Harriman frowns again trying to come up with another
solution but it isnt easy -- its his first day in
command his ship is under-manned and ill-prepared

Its a nightmare come true Kirk is itching to get in

On this his fingers digging into the arms of his chair --
but he restrains himself

HARRIMAN
What about venting plasma from
the warp nacelles That might
disrupt the ribbons hold on the

ships

NAVIGATOR
Aye sir releasing drive
plasma

A tense beat Harriman glances over at the

journalists then glances over at Kirk Kirk gives him
a pained smile trying to be encouraging even though he
knows this is not the right course of action
15B
15B

NAVIGATOR

(continuing)
Its not having any effect sir
I think --
DEMORA

Sir The starboard vessels hull
is collapsing --

INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (VFX-I)

Suddenly the right-hand ship on the screen is engulfed
by a fiery TENDRIL of energy and it EXPLODES The
other ship continues to be thrown about and buffeted
Everyone reacts with shock on the Bridge

CHEKOV
How many people were aboard
that ship

DEMORA

Two hundred sixty-five

Harriman pales at the sight seems shell-shocked by
the destruction of the ship Hes overwhelmed now at
a genuine loss as to what to do next

DEMORA
(urgent)
The Lakuls hull integrity is down
to twelve percent sir

Harriman looks over at Kirk who has remained quiet
during this entire sequence only through great effort
and out of deference to the young Captain This is a
delicate moment -- Harriman doesnt want to look
incapable but at the same time he needs help

HARRIMAN
Captain Kirk I would appreciate
any suggestions you might have

Kirk is out of his chair like a cork out of a bottle
He moves down to stand next to Harriman

KIRK
(sotto)
First -- move us within
transporter range and beam those
people to the Enterprise

Harriman looks at him with surprise

HARRIMAN
What about the gravimetric
TO

distortions Theyll tear us
apart

KIRK
(gently)
Risk is part of the game if you
want to sit in that chair

Kirk gives him a supportive look Harriman buckles
down and grimly looks at the image on the screen

HARRIMAN
Helm close to within transporter
range

Kirk glances at the Cameraman whos still shining the
light on them all

KIRK
And second -- turn that damned
thing off

The cameraman turns OFF the light

Cur

EXT SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)

The ship edges in yet closer to the crackling ribbon
The tendrils from the ribbon lash out at the ship just
missing it

INT ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE

As before

DEMORA
Were within range sir

HARRIMAN
(to lieutenant)
Beam them directly to Sickbay

CHEKOV
(concerned)
How bigs your medical staff

HARRIMAN
(embarrassed)
The medical staff doesnt
arrive until Tuesday

Chekov turns to the two journalists
CHEKOV
You and you Youve just become
nurses Lets go

Chekov and the journalists EXIT to the turbolift

DEMORA
Main Engineering reports
fluctuations in the warp plasma
relays

SCOTTY

By-pass the relays and go to

auxiliary systems

The LIEUTENANT is having problems at the aft console

LIEUTENANT

Sir Im having trouble locking

onto them They appear to be

in some sort of temporal flux

Kirk turns to Scotty

KIRK
Scotty

Scotty quickly moves to look at the Transporter

console
SCOTTY
What the hell
Kirk moves to him
SCOTTY
Their life signs are are

phasing in and out of our
space-time continuum

KIRK
Phasing To where

Scotty begins to work

NAVIGATOR
Sir Their hulls collapsing

18 EXT SPACE- THE LAKUL (VFX-I)

The ship is destroyed by an energy tendril

19 INT ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE

All eyes on Scotty

SCOTTY

I got forty-seven of them
(beat grim)

» out of one hundred fifty

Suddenly the ship is rocked violently KLAXONS and
alarms start to wail and the lights FLICKER on and off
BULKHEAD EXPLODES sending metal fragments screaming
across the Bridge and KILLING the Navigator Scotty
quickly takes over the dead mans console

KIRK
Report

DEMORA
Were caught in a gravimetric
field emanating from the trailing
edge of the ribbon

HARRIMAN
All engines full reverse

EXT SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B and RIBBON (VFX-I)

The ship is turning sideways into the WAKE of the
ribbon but cannot break away It is clearly being
pulled along out of control Tendrils leap up from the
ribbon lashing against the ship

INT ENTERPRISE-B- SICKBAY

The room is filled with the SURVIVORS of the Lakul
They are all members of the EL-AURIAAN race -- humanoid
and dressed in distinctive clothing The survivors are
in various states of shock Many sit on the floor
staring into middle distance some lie on tables
unconscious others are mumbling incoherently to
themselves Chekov and the Journalists are moving from
person to person trying to get control of the

situation as the ship is ROCKED and FLUNG about

Chekov has a tricorder

SURVIVORS
(incoherent overlapping)
The colors are touching me Im
caught in the glass Help me
I can see the seconds Over
here etc
CHEKOV

It will be all right Were going
to take care of you

He looks at the tricorder

CHEKOV
(off tricorder)
Only minor injuries so far
(beat)
But it looks like theyre all
suffering from some kind of
neural shock

One Journalist moves past a man sitting on a bio-bed
with a dazed look on his face He has a nasty-looking
wound on one side of his face (We will later learn
that this man is named DOCTOR SORAN)

The journalist is about to turn away when suddenly
Soran GRABS him roughly -- clearly a man of great
Strength -- and pulls him close Sorans eyes are
suddenly wild crazed

SORAN
Whywhy
JOURNALIST
Its all right youre safe

youre on the Enterprise

SORAN
No I have to go I have to
get back You dont understand

Let me go

Soran begins to attack the journalist but before he
can do any real damage Chekov injects Soran with a
hypospray and Soran falls unconscious

JOURNALIST
What was he talking about

Suddenly a WOMAN with her back toward us stumbles
nearby Chekov quickly grabs her arm and catches her
before she falls

CHEKOV
Easy there

The woman turns around and we see her face for the
first time -- its GUINAN She seems dazed and
confused Chekov smiles at her warmly
CHEKOV
Its going to be okay Here just
lie down

As he guides Guinan onto a table

INT ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE (VFX-I)
Energy ribbon on viewscreen

DEMORA
Inertial dampers failing

SCOTTY
Engines not responding

Harriman is gripping the arms of his chair with one
hand His face pales

HARRIMAN
(quiet)
I didnt expect to die my first
day on the job

Kirk tries to buck up the young captain

KIRK
(sotto)
The first thing you learn as
Captain is how to cheat death
(beat then louder)
Scotty

SCOTTY
(outraged)
Theres just no way to disrupt a
gravimetric field of this
magnitude

DEMORA
Hull integrity failing

Kirk looks at Scotty expectantly for a moment

SCOTTY
(continuing)
But I do have a theory

KIRK
I thought you might

SCOTTY
An anti-matter discharge directly
ahead it might disrupt the
field long enough for us to break
away

KIRK
A photon torpedo

SCOTTY
Aye

KIRK
(quickly to Demora)
Load torpedo bays prepare to fire
on my command

Demora turns to him

DEMORA
Captain we dont have any
torpedoes

Kirk glances at Harriman

KIRK
Dont tell me Tuesday

Harriman nods a little embarrassed The SHAKING gets
worse

SCOTTY
Captain it may be possible to
simulate a torpedo blast using a
resonance burst from the main
deflector dish

KIRK
(onto the idea)
Where are the deflector relays

DEMORA
Deck fifteen section twenty-one
alpha
HARRIMAN
(to Kirk)

Ill go You have the Bridge

Harriman heads for the turbolift and there is a moment
as Kirk is sorely tempted to take command of the ship
and sit in the Captains chair one more time But he
pulls himself back before Harriman can exit

KIRK
No a Captains place is on the
Bridge of his ship

(beat)
Ill take care of it

Harriman nods in acknowledgement Kirk heads for the
turbolift

KIRK
(on the move to Scotty)
Keep her together until I get
back

SCOTTY
(matter of fact)

I always do
Kirk smiles as the turbolift doors slide shut

INT ENTERPRISE-B - CORRIDOR

Kirk running down the corridor opens a door

INT ENTERPRISE-B - DEFLECTOR ROOM (CONTINUOUS)

A small control room with a few consoles Kirk rushes
in and rips off one of the large wall panels He
quickly begins to re-route cabling and circuitry

INT ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE

As before The ship is SHAKING badly
DEMORA
Forty-five seconds to structural
collapse

Scotty is working the consoles frantically

SCOTTY

longer I can hold her together

Kirk finishes working and slams the wall panel closed

KIRK
Thats it Go

INT ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE

As before

HARRIMAN
(to Demora)
Activate main deflector

Demora works the console

EXT SPACE- ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)

A large BURST OF ENERGY leaps out of the main deflector

dish and EXPLODES in front of the ship There is an
immediate reaction within the Energy Ribbon which

roils and fluctuates in response

INT ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE

As before

SCOTTY
Were breaking free

EXT SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)

The ship now begins to turn away from the

ribbon But just as its turning one final TENDRIL of

crackling

energy suddenly leaps out and hits the ship

OMITTED

INT ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE

The ship is ROCKED so hard that everyone is knocked off

their feet Gradually the SHAKING STOPS
scrambles back into position

DEMORA
Were clear

Everyone reacts with relief

HARRIMAN
(excited to com)
You did it Kirk
(to Demora)
Damage report Ensign

DEMORA
(off console)
Theres some buckling on the
starboard nacelle
(reacts)
Weve also got a hull breach in
the Engineering section

Demora

Still no response Scottys face falls

SCOTTY
(continuing to Demora)
Have Chekov meet me on deck

Harriman very concerned gets up and follows Scotty
They EXIT to the Turbolift

INT ENTERPRISE-B - CORRIDOR

Scotty and Harriman head down the Corridor They round
a bend and then stop short They react to
something ahead of them

NEW ANGLE (VFX-P)

Revealing that the corridor ahead of them is GONE A
jagged hole has been ripped in the ship and OPEN SPACE
can be seen beyond the twisted metal

A FORCEFIELD flickers on and off holding the vacuum of
space at bay

Scotty and Harriman look at the awesome sight for a
moment Chekov comes running up the Corridor behind

them He stops and reacts

CHEKOV

My God
(beat)
Was anyone in there

A long silent beat as Scotty looks out into space

SCOTTY
Aye

EXT SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B (VFX-I)

A huge chunk has been ripped out of the Engineering
section looking like an open wound Scotty Chekov
and Harriman can be seen standing inside the small
Corridor looking out into space

INT ENTERPRISE-B- BRIDGE

A short time later Scotty Harriman and Chekov are
listening to Demora who is working the Helm console

DEMORA
Ive checked the entire ship and
the surrounding space theres
no sign of him

A silent moment Chekov looks to Scotty hoping to
hear some sort of miracle Scotty takes a moment

looks at the empty command chair Then he shakes his
head A long beat as everyone is forced to accept this
terrible truth

SCOTTY
(quiet)

Just a quick run around the
block

CHEKOV
I never thought it would end like
this

SCOTTY

All things must end Mr Chekov
Harriman finally breaks the stillness of the Bridge

HARRIMAN
Lets go home

Harriman steps down to the Captains chair and takes
command of his ship

Scotty and Chekov exchange a final look Off the
reactions of these two friends whove just lost someone
very dear to them both

FADE TO BLACK
SUPER SEVENTY-EIGHT YEARS LATER

CLOSE ON A HALYARD

as a FLAG is quickly hoisted to the top of a mast The
flag reaches the top and is then caught by the wind --
the blue and white banner of the United Federation of
Planets waves in the breeze

MOVE TO REVEAL THE LOCATION

EXT SAILING VESSEL - DAY

A nineteenth-century three-masted sailing vessel (about
the size of a frigate) is hove-to and sitting in the

water gently rocking Across the stern of the ship we
can see the name ENTERPRISE picked out in gold letters

ON THE MAIN DECK

Where PICARD and RIKER are standing before the
assembled crew of the ship Everyone is dressed in
full-dress naval uniforms of the period complete with
cocked hats epaulettes etc The crew is standing at
attention the wind whistles through the rigging
the timbers creak

Picard grimly looks over his crew then finally he
nods to Riker

RIKER
Bring out the prisoner

A drummer begins a long DRUM ROLL

ON A HATCH

as WORF is brought on deck by TROI and GEORDI Worf is
shackled by hand and leg irons Troi and Geordi hold
him by either arm and shove him toward the Captain
The drum roll STOPS Picard moves to Worf and peers at
him closely
PICARD
Mister Worf I always knew this
day would come Are you prepared
to face the charges

Worf doesnt answer and Troi jabs him in the side

TROI
Answer him

WORF
I am prepared

Picard looks to Riker who then pulls out a large
rolled piece of parchment He opens the scroll and
begins to read from it In the bg Geordi removes
Worfs shackles

RIKER
We the officers and crew of the
USS Enterprise being of sound
mind and judgment hereby make
the following charges against
Lieutenant Worf One That he did
knowingly and willfully perform
above and beyond the call of duty
on countless occasions Two
That he has been a good and solid
officer on this ship for one score
less twelve years And Three
Most seriously that he has
earned the respect and admiration
of the entire crew

Riker puts away the scroll

PICARD
There can be only one punishment
for such crimes
(beat)
I hereby promote you to the rank
of Lieutenant Commander with all
the rights and privileges thereto
And may God have mercy on your
soul

Everyone ROARS in APPROVAL Picard smiles at Worf and
shakes his hand

PICARD
(contd)
Congratulations Commander

WORF
(smiles)
Thank you sir
Picard continues to smile at him for a momentthen
Riker steps in

RIKER
Extend the plank

Worfs face registers surprise as everyone GRABS HIM
and hauls him toward the side where a long plank is
being pushed out over the water

CREWMEMBERS
Into the sea with him feed him
to the sharks walk the

plank etc
Picard gives Riker a questioning look

PICARD
Dont you think youre taking this
a little too far Number One

RIKER
When we went to ancient Rome for
Deannas promotion we threw her
to the lions remember

Picard shrugs it off its not exactly his cup of
tea but hell go along with it

Worf is hustled to the rail where BEVERLY is waiting
patiently by the plank holding a long PIKE Worf is
put on the plank and Crusher prods him with the pike
until Worf is nearly at the end

Worf finally stops and turns around

WORF
(a shout)
WAIT

Everyone falls silent a moment Worf looks over
the side at the water below

WORF
(a little embarrassed)
I cant swim

LA FORGE
(calmly to Worf)
The Holodeck safety program is
engaged The computer wont let
you drown

BEVERLY
But the sharks are quite
convincing

Beverly prods him with the pike and Worf FALLS INTO THE
SEA with a huge SPLASH Everyone LAUGHS and CHEERS
Reveal DATA who is standing near the side rail
looking a little confused at the reaction

DATA
(to Beverly)
Doctor I must confess I am

lights dim damage everywhere Only a few minutes have
passed since they were attacked Riker Worf Beverly
and two SECURITY GUARDS MATERIALIZE Theyre all back
in uniform holding phasers and palm beacons Worf has
a tricorder and Beverly has a medical kit The room is
cramped there are fallen bulk-heads and blown-out
consoles The debris makes it difficult to get a clear
view of the room

WORF
These blast patterns are
consistent with type-three
disruptors

RIKER
Well that narrows it to Klingon
Breen or Romulan

Beverly follows her tricorder readings
BEVERLY
Im picking up life signs about

twenty meters ahead

That rules out Klingons

Riker gives him a look

WORF
They would not have left anyone
alive

They pick their way carefully through the carnage of
the stationand come to the body of a Starfleet
Science Officer He has taken a disruptor blast to the
back and there is a nasty-looking scorch mark on his
uniform Beverly immediately takes some devices out of
her medical kit and begins to treat him

RIKER

Worf youre with me Paskall
you and Mendez search the upper
deck

The Security Guards climb a nearby ladder while Riker
and Worf head down a dimly-lit corridor Riker stops
at two bodies in the hall checks them over -- but
theyre dead There is a sudden banging from the far
corner of the room Worf and Riker quickly move to a
collapsed bulkhead

WORF
Under here

They both grab hold of a large metal plate pull it
aside and begin to dig through the debris Finally a
HAND can be seen grasping about from within the pile of
rubble Riker and Worf work faster Worf grabs the
mans hand

WORF
Its all right do not struggle

Worf holds the mans hand as Riker shoves away a final
console We reveal the head and torso of Doctor Soran
one of the survivors from the Lakul (and last seen

in Sickbay aboard the Enterprise-B) Soran has not aged
at all over the years but he does have a permanent

scar on his face from the earlier wound He blinks a
few times seems a little dazed

Data is sitting in a chair petting SPOT THE CAT
Geordi is standing next to him

DATA
Is she still angry

GEORDI
No but Id stay out of Sickbay
for a while if I were you I
still dont know why you dropped
her in the water

DATA
I was attempting to get in the
spirit of things I thought it
would be humorous

Data frowns troubled by this recent experience He
puts Spot down and moves to a bulkhead He activates

a control panel and a small compartment slides OPEN
revealing a small COMPUTER CHIP which is suspended in
a glass and metal framework Data looks at the chip
for a beat and Geordi moves to him in concern

GEORDI
Data youre not thinking about
using that thing are you

DATA
It has occurred to me on several
occasions But I believe this may
be the appropriate time

GEORDI
Wait a minute I thought youve
always been afraid it would
overload your neural net

DATA
That is true However I believe
my growth as an artificia
life form has reached an impasse
For thirty-four years I have
endeavored to become more human -
to grow beyond my origina
programming And yet I am still
unable to grasp such a simple
concept as humor

(re chip)

This emotion chip is the only

answer

Geordi considers a moment looks at the chip
and reluctantly has to agree

GEORDI
All right

Data sits down and La Forge moves to stand behind him

GEORDI
But at the first sign of trouble
Im going to deactivate it

Agreed

Geordi works on Datas head for a moment and then
OPENS a panel on Datas head revealing the blinking
circuitry within

INT READY ROOM

Riker is standing next to Picard who has his back turned
and is staring out the window Picard seems distracted
during the scene his mind clearly elsewhere as Riker
finishes his report

RIKER
We found two dead Romulans aboard
the station Were analyzing
their equipment to see if we can
determine what ship they came
from

Picard nods absently
PICARD

Theres still no indication of why
they attacked the station

RIKER
We think they were looking for
something -- they practically tore

the place apart

PICARD
Hmm
(beat)
Inform Starfleet Command This
could indicate a new Romulan
threat in this sector
TO

RIKER
You want me to contact Starfleet

PICARD
Is there a problem

RIKER
No sir

PICARD
Thank you Number One

Picard keeps his back turned looking out the window
Riker hesitates awkward

RIKER

There is something else Captain
One of the scientists a Doctor
Soran has insisted on speaking
with you

(beat)
I told him you were busy sir but
he said it was absolutely
imperative that he speak with you
right away

PICARD
Understood That will be all

RIKER
Sir is there anything wrong

PICARD
No Thank you

A beat then Riker turns and EXITS Off Picards
unreadable face

The room is bustling with patrons and activity Data
ENTERS with an odd look on his facehis body

language subtly altered He is looking at the world
through new eyes Geordi is following him closely
watching his every move They move to the bar Guinan
comes over -- she has not aged at all since the
Enterprise-B She sets down an exotic-looking container
full of dark liquid

GUINAN
You two just volunteered to be my
first victims
(re liquid)
This is a new concoction I
picked up on Forcas Three Trust me
youre going to love it

She pours two glasses of the liquid Data takes one
and sniffs it then takes a drink Geordi watches him
closely Data frowns

GEORDI
Well

DATA
I believe the beverage has
provoked an emotional response

GEORDI
Really What do you feel

DATA
I am uncertain I have had little
experience with emotions I am
unable to articulate the
sensation

GUINAN
Emotions

GEORDI

Ill explain later

Data finishes the drink concentrates tries to make
sense of the rush of feelings His expression is one
of disgust

GUINAN

I dont think he likes it

In the bg we see Picard ENTER Ten Forward

FOLLOW PICARD

as he walks through Ten Forward and heads toward a
table by the windows Soran is sitting at the table
staring out at the stars lost in thought His
observatory uniform is distinctive and sets him apart
from everyone else in the room Picard walks up to the
table

PICARD
Doctor Soran

SORAN
Yes yes Captain -- thank you for
coming

The men shake hands and Picard sits down Soran is an
imposing physical presence but at the moment he seems
very much the eccentric scientists consumed with his
work Picard waves away a waiter

PICARD
Nothing for me
(brusque to Soran)
I understand theres something
urgent you need to discuss with
me

SORAN
Yes I need to return to the
observatory immediately I must
continue a critical experiment I
was running on the Amargosa star

Picards reaction is a little impatient -- this doesnt
sound that imperative to him

PICARD
Doctor were still conducting
an investigation into the attack
Once weve completed our work
well be happy to allow you and
your fellow scientists back aboard
the observatory Until then --

SORAN
The timing is very important on my
experiment -- if it is not

completed within the next twelve
hours years of research will be

lost

PICARD
Were doing the best we can Now
if youll excuse me

Picard moves to stand but Soran reaches out and gently
but firmly grabs him by the arm The unexpected
physical contact and the change of intensity in Sorans
face stops Picard in his tracks

SORAN

(cryptically)
They say time is the fire in
which we burn and right now
Captain my time is running out

(beat)
We leave so many things unfinished
in our lives -- Im sure you can
understand

For some reason Sorans words have struck a deep chord
within Picard

He looks away from Sorans compelling gaze and thinks
for a long moment When he finally speaks his voice
is barely above a whisper

PICARD
Ill see what I can do

Picard walks away without a word before Soran can
thank him Soran looks after him with relief then
pulls out an ANTIQUE POCKET WATCH and opens it He
looks at the watch for a long moment then snaps it
closed and head for the opposite exit from the one
Picard took FOLLOW Soran across Ten Forwarduntil
he suddenly stops in shock at something he sees

SORANS POV

of Guinan who is now back at the bar

RESUME SORAN

A dark look crosses his face -- he is disturbed by the
sight of Guinan He quickly turns and EXITS

ON GUINAN

she begins to sense something as though someone is
watching her She turns looks in the direction where
Soran was just standing but theres no one there now
She shakes off the feeling and goes back to work

A short time later A Romulan tricorder is connected
to some diagnostic equipment near a console Worf is

talking to Riker

Worf activates a MONITOR which shows a complex diagram

of sensor information

The station is still a wreck Geordi

WORF
One of the dead Romulans had a
tricorder We analyzed its sensor
logs and found they were scanning
for signature particles of a
compound called trilithium

RIKER
Trilithium

WORF
An experimental compound the
Romulans have been working on In
theory a trilithium-based
explosive would be thousands of
times more powerful than an
anti-matter weapon But they never
found a way to stabilize it

RIKER
Why were they looking for it ona
Federation observatory It doesnt
make any sense

Riker considers

RIKER
(contd)

Have Geordi and Data go over with
the next Away Team tell them to
scan the observatory for
trilithium

WORF

Data giggles louder

DATA
(laughing to himself
I get it I get it

Data laughs again
DATA
When you said to Commander

Riker

(imitating Geordis voice)
The clown can stay but the
Ferengi in the gorilla suit has to

Geordi looks blankly at him for a moment

GEORDI

During the Farpoint mission We
were on the Bridge and you told a
joke That was the punch line

It was very funny

GEORDI
Thanks

Geordi indicates a corridor They EXIT in that
direction

INT OBSERVATORY CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

A short corridor connecting the Ops Center with other

compartments Geordi suddenly stops in front of what
appears to be a standard bulkhead

GEORDI
Wait a minute theres a hidden
doorway here I can see the
joint of the metal with my VISOR

Geordi runs his finger in a vertical line along what
appears to be a smooth bulkhead

DATA
(off tricorder)
There appears to be a dampening
field in operation I cannot scan
beyond the bulkhead

Geordi puts his tricorder away and begins looking for
a way to open the door

GEORDI
I dont see a control panelor
an access port

DATA
(off tricorder)
It appears to be a magnetically
sealed

Data steps forward and OPENS a small panel on wrist
and makes a quick adjustment to the circuitry within

DATA
I believe I can reverse the
polarity by attenuating my axial
servo

Data completes his adjustment and then moves his wrist
over the door panel

DATA
(joking)
Open sesame

There is a HUMMING sound followed by a loud CLICK The
door slides open

personality

Geordi reacts to the bad pun with a grimace They EXIT
to

INT OBSERVATORY PROBE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
A small room with several probes stacked in holding
racks Geordi and Data scan

GEORDI
Im still not picking up anything
Someone went to a lot of trouble
to shield this room

They put their tricorders away and begin looking around
the room Data continues to snicker and giggle as he
tries not to laugh at jokes his mind conjures up
Geordi begins inspecting the probes finally stops

at one probe which has SEVERAL ODD DEVICES attached to
the side

GEORDI
Data take a look at this
(Data comes over)
You ever seen a solar probe with
this kind of configuration

Data uses the tricorder as if it were a puppet as he
opens and closes it like a mouth

DATA
(making tricorder talk)
No Geordi I have not It is
most unusual

Data giggles and Geordi reacts with the irritation of
someone listening to a very bad comedian

GEORDI
Just help me get this panel open

Data helps Geordi as they try to open a panel on the
casing of the probe They open the panel and Geordi
looks insidehe reacts to something

GEORDI
Whoa my VISORS picking up
something in the theta bandit
could be a trilithium signature

Data suddenly start LAUGHING Geordi turns in
irritation

myself I think something is

wrong

begins to JERK and SHAKE and goes into a bizarre
emotional seizure A rush of EMOTIONS race across
his face anger passion shock a kaleidoscopic
blur of reactions contort his features Then it stops
and he FALLS to the ground
GEORDI

Geordi rushes to him Data has a look of surprise on
his face as he blinks a few times He sits up

overloaded my positronic relays

standing in the room Geordi didnt hear him come in

GEORDI
Oh Doctor yeah as a matter
of fact there is Theres a
damping field in here blocking

Over the above dialogue Soran glances over at the
solar probe Geordi was inspecting He notes the opened
panel and a disturbed look crosses his face

Soran looks back at Geordi

SORAN

Soran moves toward them and then without warning he
punches Geordi in the face KNOCKING the VISOR across

unresolved conflicts between you

What I cant get out of my mind is
the image of Rene -- my nephew

I just cant believe hes gone
He trails off
TROI

Its only natural to feela
heightened sense of tragedy when
a child dies

(sensing more)
But it goes deeper than that
doesnt it I can sense that Rene
meant a great deal to you

PICARD
In a way he was as close as I
ever came to having a child of my
own

Troi eyes an open photo album on the table

She reaches

over and flips through the pages for a moment There

are many photos inside from many periods

in time

including one of Picards brother standing next to his

young son This is the Picard family album

TROI
Your family history is very
important to you isnt it

PICARD

(nods)
Ever since I was a little boy I
remember hearing about the family
line The Picards that fought at
Trafalgar the Picards that
settled the first Martian colony
When my brother married and had a
son

Picard hesitates -- this is difficult for him

TROI
You felt it was no longer your
responsibility to carry on the
family line

PICARD
(nods)
My brother had shouldered that
burden allowing me to pursue my

own selfish needs

TROI
Theres nothing selfish about
pursuing your own life your own

SORAN

I have the weapon Lursa And if

you I advise you to be a little
more careful in the future

BEtor grabs Soran and holds a wicked-looking knife to
his throat

BETOR
Perhaps we are tired of waiting

Soran is unfazed by this threat

SORAN
Without my research the

It looks like a power surge fused
the emotional chip into his neural

WORF

a grim look on his face

Will that be a danger to him

I dont think so The chip still
seems to be working Id feel
better if I could take a closer
look but I cant remove it
without completely dismantling his

Looks like youre stuck with
emotions for a while How do you
feel

I am quite preoccupied with
concern about Geordi

RIKER
We all are Data But were going
to get him back

DATA
I hope so sir

Datas expression is still one of concern Beverly
pulls Riker aside

BEVERLY
Wil I checked into Doctor Sorans
background

Beverly activates the wall monitor and a picture of
Doctor Soran along with some biographical information
appears

BEVERLY
Hes an El-Aurian over three
hundred years old He lost his
entire family when the Borg
destroyed his world Soran
escaped with a handful of other
refugees aboard a ship called the
Lakul The ship was destroyed by
some kind of energy ribbon but
Soran and forty-six others were
rescued by the Enterprise-B

RIKER

That was the mission where James
Kirk was killed

on board

heard in a long time

MOVE TO REVEAL Guinans Quarters which are unlike any
of the others on the Enterprise None of the standard
furniture consoles or decoration are present The
floor is made of tile not carpet the walls are
draped in exotic fabric The lighting is moody and
subdued

Picard is standing before Guinan who is sitting cross-—
legged on the floor They talk to each other with an
easy familiarity two old friends who know each

other well

PICARD
Do you remember him

GUINAN
Oh yes I remember everyone who
was on the Lakul every face
even the ones who didnt make
it

Guinan stands and begins to move about the room
shes clearly troubled by the memories She hesitates
looks off into the middle-distance for a few moments
Picard moves to her

PICARD
Guinan Its important that you
tell me what you know We think
Sorans developed a weapon a
terrible weapon It might give
him enough power to --

GUINAN
Soran doesnt care about power or
weapons All he cares about is
getting back to the Nexus

PICARD
Whats the Nexus

Guinan moves to a table and begins to shift around some

exotic-looking alien artifacts distracting
herself this is difficult for her to discuss
GUINAN
Its a place Ive tried very hard
to forget

She makes the decision to plunge ahead

GUINAN
That ribbon isnt just some random
energy phenomenon traveling
through space its a doorway
It leads to another place the
Nexus It doesnt exist in our
Universe and it doesnt play by
the same rules either

PICARD
What happened to you

GUINAN

I cant remember very much what
it looked like or how long I was
there but I do remember how it
felt

She turns to him and her face is filled with some kind
of awe at the memory

GUINAN
It was like being inside joy
As if joy was a real thing that I
could wrap around myself Ive
never been so content

A long beat as Picard absorbs her words

PICARD
But then you were beamed away

Guinan shows a rare burst of anger

GUINAN
I was pulled away I didnt want
to leave none of us did I felt
like Id left a part of myself
behind All I could think about
was getting back I didnt care
what I had to do

Guinan moves to a window and looks out at the stars

GUINAN
TO

It took a long time but
eventually I learned to live with
it And I began to realize that
my experience in the Nexus had
changed me

(beat)
I knew things about people
about eventsabout time

PICARD
Your sixth sense Ive always
wondered where it came from

(beat)
And what about Soran

GUINAN
Soran may still be obsessed with
getting back And if he is hell
do anything to find that doorway
again

PICARD
But why destroy a star
(beat)
Thank you Guinan

He heads for the door

GUINAN
Let someone else do it Jean-Luc

Picard stops looks at her

GUINAN
Let them send another starship
Dont get near the ribbon If you
go into that Nexus youre not
going to care about Soran or the
Enterprise or me All youre
going to care about is how it
feels to be there

seated behind a table holding the VISOR A PADD and
Sorans pocket watch sit on the table Geordi is
sitting in a chair across from him -- his shirt has
been removed He looks very tense

SORAN

A remarkable piece of equipment
but a little inelegant wouldnt
you say

Have you ever considered a
prosthesis that would make you
look a little more normal

GEORDI
Whats normal

SORAN
Normal is what everyone else is
and what you are not

GEORDI
What do you want

Soran takes a moment

SORAN

As you may or may not be aware I
am an El-Aurian Some people call
us a race of listeners We
listen

(beat)
Right now Mr La Forge you
have my undivided attention I
want to listen to everything you
know about trilithium and me

Geordi thinks

GEORDI
Trilithium is an experimental
compound developed by the
Romulans I think its a
derivative of --

Soran picks up the PADD from the desk and activates it
Suddenly something small with sharp edges can be
seen MOVING just underneath Geordis skin near his
chest Geordi moves his hand to the spot but then the
protrusion is suddenly gone

SORAN
I dont want a science lecture
You were on that observatory
looking for trilithium why
GEORDI
I was ordered to by the Captain

On the PADD in Sorans hand we can now see an interior
graphic of Geordis body sitting in the chair The
graphic is interactive moving as Geordi moves

A BLINKING DOT represents the movement of the probe
inside his body Right now the dot is in the middle

of his chest

SORAN

Lets try to move beyond the usual
prisoner-interrogator banter
shall we You have information
and I need it

(beat)
Did the Captain explain his orders
to you Did he say why you were
searching for trilithium

GEORDI
No
SORAN
What about Guinan What has

she told you about me

GEORDI
Guinan I dont know what youre
talking about

On the PADD we now see the dot has moved to a position
next to Geordis heart Soran looks up at Geordi

SORAN
My instincts tell me youre lying
And I know that cant be easy for
you
(off PADD)
I can see you have a good heart

Soran taps a control on the PADD Suddenly Geordi
grabs his chest in pain Soran watches Geordi for a
few seconds then taps the PADD again Geordi gasps
and starts to breathe

SORAN

Oh I forgot to tell you While
you were unconscious I injected
a nano-probe into your
bloodstream Its been navigating
your cardiovascular system and
right now Ive attached it to your
left ventricle

(smiles)
A little trick I picked up
from the Borg
TO

GEORDI

(gasping)
Yeah theyre full of great
ideas
SORAN

I just stopped your heart for five
seconds It felt like an

eternity didnt it Did you know
that you can stop the human heart
for up to ten minutes before the
onset of brain damage

GEORDI
No I didnt know that

SORAN
We learn something new about
ourselves every day

(beat)

Now Maybe I didnt make myself
clear It is very important that
you tell me exactly what Captain
Picard knows

GEORDI
I told you everything you might
as well just kill me right now

Sorans features soften as he smiles slightly For a
moment he looks genuinely compassionate -- and its
a disturbing contrast to his usual dark intensity

SORAN
Im not a killer Mr La Forge

Lets try thirty seconds

Soran taps a control on the PADD Geordi gasps and
strains against an unimaginable pain

Soran picks up his pocket watch and opens the cover
sits back in his chair watching the seconds tick

computers which handle the enormous task of tracking
the ships position in space

The monitors around the room display various diagrams
of the ENERGY RIBBON (as seen in the beginning of the
film)

Data is sitting at a computer console which has a great
deal of complex information on the screen Picard is
standing next to him Throughout the following Data
seems distracted and preoccupied

According to our information the
ribbon is a conflux of temporal
energy which travels through our
galaxy every thirty-nine point one
years

When is it expected back

Data doesnt answer right away

Sorry Captain The Ribbon has
already entered the galaxy It
will pass through this sector in

Picard moves about the room hes frustrated
tired but determined to find out whats going on
PICARD
Guinan said Soran was trying to
get back to the ribbon if

thats true then there must be
some connection with the Amargosa
star

The stars destruction has had
numerous astro-physical effects
within this sector However none
of them appear to have a
connection to the energy ribbon

which has been altered or
changed no matter how
insignificant

feelings of remorse and regret
concerning my actions on the
observatory

PICARD

What do you mean

DATA
I wanted to save Geordi I
tried but I experienced
something I did not expect
(beat)
I believe it was fear

Picard regards him sympathetically

PICARD
Fear is a very difficult emotion
to overcome Its something we
all have to learn to deal with

DATA
But I did not deal with it sir
I let it prevent me from helping
my friend
(beat)
Does that make me a coward

PICARD
No And what you must try to
avoid is becoming consumed by
another emotion which I believe
youre beginning to experience

guilt

feeling

Bozeman was forced to make a
course correction a research
project on Gorik Four was
halted due to increased neutrino
particles ambient magnetic
fields have decreased by --

PICARD
Wait The Bozeman why did it
change course

DATA
(matter of fact)

The destruction of the Amargosa
star has altered the gravitational
forces throughout the sector Any
ship passing through this region
will have to make a minor course
correction

Data hesitates still obsessed with his own emotional
turmoil Picard finally has to lay down the law
PICARD

(firm)
Data I have nothing but sympathy
for what youre going through
But right now I need your full
attention on the task at hand
If you cant provide it then Ill
have to relieve you of duty until
Doctor Crusher can remove this
emotion chip of yours Im sorry
but you leave me no other choice

This snaps Data back he considers this for a long
moment then looks determined

DATA

I do not wish to remove the chip
sir Although these emotions are
proving difficult to deal with
I cannot imagine going back to a
life without them I have taken
an important step toward becoming
truly human If I were to turn
back now

But why Why try to alter its
path why not simply fly into it

Data thinks for a moment

Our records show that every ship
which has approached the ribbon
has either been destroyed or
severely damaged

insight

Picard continues to walk around the perimeter of the

GNARLED ROOT from a large nearby tree The root is
poking out of the ground leaving a small arch through
which daylight can be seen Picards mind begins
racing he glances at Soran and then picks up a
pebble and while keeping his eye on the root he tosses
the pebble into the air where it HITS the forcefield

-- The forcefield FLASHES on briefly and Picard can see
that the bottom border of the field follows the contour
of the root But it does not extend underneath the

SORAN
Careful Captain Thats a fifty
gigawatt forcefield I wouldnt
want to see you get hurt

Thank you

As the room comes into focus The first thing we see
is an enormous gaily decorated CHRISTMAS TREE
sparkling with hundreds of lights

REVEAL THE ROOM

A 24th-century FRENCH LIVING ROOM It is beautifully
decorated with lights ornaments holly brightly
wrapped presents are clustered beneath the Christmas
tree There are FIVE CHILDREN standing and sitting in
the room all looking at Picard with bright smiling
faces waiting for him to say something

Picard stares at the scene for a moment unsure how to
react Then we hear the womans voice again and we
move to reveal an attractive WOMAN in her forties
standing next to Picard

WOMAN
Go on say something Theyre
waiting
Picard is stunned
PICARD
I dont know what to say

One of the children a young GIRL speaks up

GIRL
Say Merry Christmas Papa

PICARD
(in a daze)
Merry Christmas

The children break out into applause The woman kisses
him on the cheek then steers him to a large
overstuffed chair Picard sits down and the

children starts handing out presents with much laughter
and chatting

CHILDREN
This ones for you wheres
mine I hope this is the book

I asked for take this one to
Papa

As the activity swirls around him Picard begins to
feel an immense sense of satisfaction and happiness
Its like a drug -- an overwhelming feeling of joy and
contentment fills Picard Its a wondrous experience
He settles back in the chair and a smile spreads across
his face For reasons he cannot name and does not even
want to understand at the moment he is very very
happy

GIRL
(to Picard)
Isnt the tree beautiful Papa

Picard answers as if it were the most natural thing in
the world

PICARD
Oh yes yes its astonishingly
beautiful All of it

All of the children now crowd around the chair with a
single large gift and hand it to Picard One of the
younger boys speaks up

YOUNG BOY
This is from all of us

PICARD
Thank you I cant imagine what
it is

Picard tears open the box and pulls out a 19th century
SEXTANT - an old-fashioned nautical navigational
instrument Its a beautiful piece with polished and
gleaming brass

YOUNG BOY

Its a sack-tent

Picard eyes it with delight

PICARD
You mean a sextant And its a
handsome one at that from about

eighteen twenty Id say
Wherever did you find it

GIRL

Oh a secret well that makes

it a doubly special gift Thank

you thank you all

The children react with pleasure They cluster around
him showering him with hugs and kisses

CHILDREN

You Father etc

Picard is covered in a blanket of love and affection
The children pull back and return to their own
presents There is a swirl of activity and commotion
as a warm and heartfelt Christmas morning is played
out

WOMAN

Ill go get dinner ready
theyll be starving in a minute

Picard nods as the woman EXITS the room He looks
around the scene utterly happy utterly content

The children continue to chatter and laugh among
themselves as Picards eye falls on the glorious
Christmas tree He cant help but smile as he looks
over the ornaments and decorations

PICARDS POV

of the sparkling lights and ornaments -- a swirl of
color and light

PICARD

His eye is caught by something in particular on the
tree He leans forward slightly and stares at it

PICARDS POV (VFX-P)

His eye has been caught by an ORNAMENT near the

top of the tree It is a large and beautiful glass
ball with a tiny LIGHT at the center in the shape of a
star As Picard watches the star suddenly GOES OUT
and it radiates a SHIMMERING LIGHT EFFECT that expands
outward into the glass sphere

Its a startling and beautiful ornament whose effect is
reminiscent of the star going out as seen earlier in the
movie But this is just coincidence this is the way

the ornament was designed and its simply one of many
ornaments on the tree
159 PICARD

reacts The image of the ornament has touched a nerve
within him somewhere It has reminded him of something
hed nearly forgotten - a discordant note in an
otherwise wondrous and magical scene He frowns the
reverie momentarily disrupted But he tries to push it
aside not wanting the spell to be broken He stands
and turns away from the tree and looks out a nearby
window -- its snowing and the beautiful image of snow
soothes him for a moment Then he reacts to something

160 PICARDS POV (VFX-P)

reflected on the pane of glass is the image of the
ornament -- its still blinking Picard now realizes
that this image is not going to go away he cant
hide from it

PICARD
No this isnt right this
cant be real

GUINANS VOICE
Its as real as you want it to be

Picard turns to see

161 GUINAN (VFX-P)

standing before him She is wearing the same outfit
seen in the beginning of the movie on the Enterprise-B
As they talk the children and the woman continue to
move about their business as if Picard and Guinan
arent there

Picard is stunned

Picard looks around

PICARD
This is the Nexus

GUINAN

to be
PICARD
But I never had a wife children

Picard tries to make sense of it- he focuses on
Guinan

(off his puzzled look
Think of me as an echo of the

Guinan smiles at him

BOYS VOICE

Picard glances over at the boy who is building a play
castle out of the 24th-century equivalent of Lego
For a moment Picard is tempted to drift back to the
warm embrace of the fantasy

PICARD
(to boy)
In a few minutes

Picard looks around at the children the lure to stay
here becoming more powerful

PICARD
(continuing awed to
Guinan)
These are my children my

Yeah Theyre great arent they
You can go back and see them
born go forward and see your
grandchildren time has no
meaning here

WOMANS VOICE
Dinners ready Lets go

Theres a general rush toward the adjacent dining room
The youngest boy looks at Picard goes over to him and
takes his hand

BOY
Papa are you coming

Picard looks down into the face of his child His

heart swells the temptation to stay here and live this
out is profound Almost in a trance he takes a few

steps with the child toward the dining room His eye

is caught again by the unusual ornament on the tree for a
moment torn between the two images and then in

one of the most difficult moments of his life he bends
down to the child

PICARD
Go on go on without me

The boy looks at him quizzically for a moment then
obeys his father and dashes off toward the dining room
to join the others Picard straightens up and tries to
steel his voice

PICARD
Guinan can I leave the Nexus

GUINAN
Why would you want to leave

PICARD
(insistent)
Can I
GUINAN
Yes where would you go

PICARD
I dont understand

GUINAN
I told you time has no meaning
here If you leave you can go
anywhere any time

Picard realizes the opportunity before him

PICARD
I know exactly where I want to
go and when Back to that

mountaintop on Veridian Three
before Soran put out the star I
have to stop him

GUINAN
What makes you think things will
be any different this time

PICARD
Youre right Ill need help

Guinan will you come back with
me Together we could --

GUINAN
I cant leave Im already there
remember

Picard looks crestfallen for a moment Guinan gives
him an enigmatic smile

GUINAN
I know just the guy

Suddenly theres the cry of a HAWK from offscreen
Picard turns at the sound --

162 EXT KIRKS HOME - DAY

Picard finds himself standing outside a rustic but
Architecturally striking house with spectacular views
in the Canadian Rockies A hawk is circling overhead
making the crying sound that Picard heard The air is
cold frigid -- Picard can see his breath Picard is
just starting to adjust to this sudden change in
location when he hears the sound of wood being CHOPPED
from around the corner of the house Picard moves to
look around the corner and sees -

James T Kirk Hes still in his uniform and looks

exactly as he did the last time we saw him aboard the
Enterprise-B at the beginning of the film He is
vigorously chopping wood with an axe Hes enjoying
himself lost in the sheer pleasure of the manual
labor Hes never felt this good in his life Theres
no trace of back pain or any other ailment Picard
recognizes the famous Captain - as would any 24
Century Starfleet officer

PICARD
James Kirk

Kirk pauses looks up at the strange man before him
His expression is wondrous almost child-like Like in
Picards Christmas sequence Kirk is immersed in the
sensual feeling of the Nexus Its like a dream thats
over-powered him

KIRK
Beautiful day isnt it

PICARD
Yes yes it is

Kirk points to a nearby log on the woodpile

KIRK
Do you mind

It takes Picard a beat before he realizes that Kirk
wants him to put the log on the chopping block for him

PICARD
Oh

Picard places the log on the block and Kirk gives it a
vigorous chop with the axe

PICARD
Captain do you realize what --

But Kirk interrupts as he sees something oc

KIRK
Wait a second I think
somethings burning

Picard follows his look to see SMOKE billowing out of
one of the windows of the house Kirk rushes into the
house and Picard follows

INT KIRKS HOME- KITCHEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Kirk rushes in The kitchens decor is 19th century

with a few 23rd Century touches -- copper pans and an
antique stove mixed comfortably with computer consoles
and Starfleet paraphernalia Picard hesitates in the
doorway -- a little unsure about rushing into some
strangers house

Kirk yanks a burning frying pan of food off the stove
Its very hot -- he quickly sets it down near the sink
waves the smoke away with his hand

KIRK
Looks like someone was cooking
eggs
(to Picard)
Come on in its all right This
is my house -- or at least it used
to be I sold it years ago

Picard comes in and tries to orient Kirk to whats
going on

PICARD
Im Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the
starship Enterprise

Before Kirk can react to this remark an antique CLOCK
on a shelf CHIMES as it strikes the hour Kirk moves

to the shelf and looks at the clock in surprise and
wonder -- he is entranced by this experience beginning
to connect with things and memories from his past

KIRK
This clock I gave this clock to
Bones

PICARD

(pressing on)
Im from what you would consider
the future the twenty-fourth
century

Kirk hears what Picard is saying but like Picard in

his fantasy he is more interested in the sights and
sounds around him A dog barks from oc They both

look as a large black dog bounds into the room and greets
Kirk with enthusiasm

KIRK
(affectionately)
Jake Jake you miserable old
Mutt How can you be here

(to Picard)
Hes been dead seven years

Kirk is still looking around the kitchen when suddenly we
hear a WOMANS VOICE from somewhere upstairs that

stops Kirk in his tracks As she speaks we can see

the shock on Kirks face
ANTONIAS VOICE
Come on Jim Im starving How
long are you going to be rattling
around that kitchen

A beat
KIRK
(amazed)

Thats Antonia

Kirk looks at the food on the stove Hes beginning to
realize something

KIRK
Wait a minute
Kirk glances at Picard
KIRK
The future what are you
talking about This is the

past

Kirk moves to a drawer and opens it Inside is a
HORSESHOE with a tiny red bow tied to it This
confirms things for Kirk He picks up the horseshoe

KIRK
This is nine years ago the day
I told her I was going back to

Starfleet

Kirk is swept up in the moment overwhelmed by
memories sensations feelings He goes back to the
frying pan and looks at the contents with a sudden
burst of recognition

KIRK
These were Ktarian eggs -- her
favoriteI was cooking them to
soften the blow
(re horseshoe)
And I gave her this

Picard steps in

PICARD
I know how real this must seem to
you but its not This isnt
Really your house Weve both
been caught up in some sort of
temporal nexus

But Kirks mind is clearly elsewhere hes being
swept away by the emotion of the moment realizing the
opportunity he suddenly has
KIRK
Dill weed

Kirk indicates a shelf as if asking Picard to go to
it

KIRK
Theres a bottle of dill weed on
the second shelf to the left
right behind the nutmeg

Kirk moves to the stove and tosses out the ruined eggs
He cracks open two new eggs on the skillet and begins
preparing a breakfast Picard waits for a moment then
goes to the shelf grabs the dill weed and hands it

to Kirk

PICARD
How long have you been here

Kirk takes the bottle and uses it to season the eggs

KIRK
I dont know I was on the
Enterprise-B in the deflector
control room keep stirring

these will you

Kirk moves to a cabinet and begins putting plates on a
breakfast tray Picard is getting a little impatient
but stirs the eggs anyway

KIRK
(continuing)
The bulkhead in front of me
Disappeared then I was out

there chopping wood
(back to stove)

Thanks
Kirk takes the pan of eggs back from Picard

PICARD
History records that you died
saving the Enterprise-B from an
energy ribbon eighty years ago

But Picards words mean almost nothing to Kirk He is
Thoroughly enjoying himself and Picard is almost a
distraction Kirk begins serving the eggs onto the
plates and grabs a small vase of flowers to put on the
tray

KIRK
(amused)
So youre telling me this is the
twenty-fourth century and Im
dead

PICARD
Not exactly As I said this is
some kind of

KIRK
Temporal nexus yeah I heard you
(frowns at tray)
Somethings missing

Then he remembers and turns to look at a nearby toaster --
as if on cue two slices of toast pop out Kirk grins

and puts the toast on the plates Kirk picks up the

tray and heads for the door

PICARD
Captain I need your help I want
you to leave the Nexus with me

Kirk goes out of the kitchen and Picard follows

164 INT KIRKS HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Kirk and Picard both on the move Kirk heading for a
staircase

PICARD
We have to go back to a planet
called Veridian III and stop a
man from destroying a star There
are millions of lives at stake

Kirk tries to keep it light hoping this man will go
away

KIRK
You said history considers me
dead Who am I to argue with
history

PICARD
Youre a Starfleet Officer and you
have a duty to --

KIRK

(hard)
I dont need to be lectured by
you I was out saving the galaxy
when your grandfather was still in
diapers And frankly I think the
galaxy owes me one

(beat)
I was like you once so worried
about duty and obligations that I

couldnt see anything past this
uniform And in the end what did
it get me Nothing Not this
time

Kirk brushes past Picard and stops at the foot of the
stairs

KIRK
(looking up the stairs)
Im going to walk up these stairs
march into that bedroom and tell
Antonia that I want to marry her

Kirk begins to climb the stairs

KIRK
This time things are going to be
different

He goes through a bedroom door and closes it behind
him Picard glances around the room in frustration
then gets a determined look on his face and marches up
the stairs after Kirk grasps the doorknob opens it
and steps through the door into

INT BARN - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Picard suddenly finds himself standing in the doorway
of a wooden barn Straw on the floor farm
implements on the walls sunlight streaming in
through the slats There are stalls in the barn with
a few horses visible

Kirk is standing a short distance away -- he looks
surprised as well and he is no longer holding the
tray of food

PICARD
(re barn)
This doesnt look like your

bedroom

Kirk looks around for a moment the pieces starting to
fall into place He smiles with a growing
realization

KIRK

No no its not Its better
PICARD

Better
KIRK

This is my uncles barn in Iowa
TO

He points to a horse with a saddle on it

KIRK
(re horse)
I took that horse out for a ride
seven years ago on a spring
day

Kirk moves to the barn door and opens it revealing a
beautiful spring day

KIRK
Just like this If Im right
this is the day I met Antonia

He turns to Picard

KIRK
This Nexus of yours is very
clever I can start all over
again -- do things right from day
one

Kirk grabs the horse swings up onto the saddle and
rides out of the barn filled with excitement Picard
watches him for a moment then looks at one of the
other horses in the barn he makes a decision and
then moves toward a saddle hanging on the wall

CUT
EXT COUNTRYSIDE - DAY (VFX-P)
Kirk is riding his horse hard over the countryside --
and across a stream through a thicket of trees and

finally out onto a rolling plain There is a large
RAVINE up ahead Kirk sees it and smiles tightly He
spurs his horse faster toward the ravine The horse
is tearing along comes up to the edge of the
precipice and makes a daring leap to the other side

Horse and rider land together and Kirk spurs the horse
on But as he rides we begin to see a change come
over him -- a look of doubt crosses his face
Somethings not right He slows the horse to a trot
and then to a complete stop He sits there for a
moment and frowns turns and looks back at the

ravine which is now a fair distance away Something
about that jump is nagging at him

He turns his horse around and then digs in his heels
The horse breaks into a gallop racing back toward the

ravine

Kirk grips the reins tight in his hands and then the
horse makes the LEAP across yet again

This time when Kirk lands he brings his horse to an
immediate stop We can see on his face that something
is very wrong He turns and stares at the ravine with
a mixture of shock and sadness on his face

In the distance Picard can be seen approaching on a
horse of his own He stops next to Kirk There is a

long quiet moment as the two men sit there side by

side Kirk is introspective as he sorts through his

feelings

KIRK

(re ravine)
I must have made this jump fifty
times and every time it scared
the hell out of me But not this
time

(beat)
Because its not real

A quiet beat Kirk turns and looks toward a particular
hill in the distance shading his eyes against the
bright sun Picard follows his gaze and we can now see
the distant figure of a WOMAN walking her horse

PICARD
(re woman)
Antonia
KIRK
(nods)
Shes not real either is she
Nothing here is nothing here
matters
All euphoria is now gone from Kirk -- Its a moment of

self-revelation He glances around

KIRK
Its kinda like orbital
skydiving Exciting for a few
minutes but in the end you

havent really done anything
you havent made a difference

Kirk takes a beat then looks at Picard And in a way
hes truly seeing him for the first time

KIRK
Captain of the Enterprise huh

PICARD
Thats right

KIRK
Close to retirement

PICARD
I hadnt planned on it

There is a passion and a fervor in Kirk that we havent
seen until now

The two captains face each other for a moment

KIRK
Well let me tell you something -
dont Dont let them promote

you dont let them transfer

you dont let anything take you

off the Bridge of that ship
(beat)

Because while youre there you
can make a difference

Picard

hears what Kirk is saying but also knows thats not the
whole story Picard gives him a direct look and there

is something in Picards eyes -- a glint of resolve and
determination

A long

PICARD
You dont need to be on the Bridge
of a starship Come with me
Help me stop Soran
(beat)
Make a difference again

silent beat as Kirk considers Picard And

unexpectedly a smile spreads across his face

KIRK
How can I argue with the Captain
of the Enterprise

(a beat)
What was the name of that
Planet Veridian III
PICARD

Thats right

KIRK
I take it the odds are against us
and the situation is grim

PICARD
You could say that

KIRK
(musing)
Of course if Spock were here
hed say I was being an
irrational illogical human for
wanting to go on a mission like

slowly
that

And for the first time we can see the twinkle in his
eye that tells us Jim Kirk is back

KIRK
Sounds like fun

The two men turn and walk away from Antoniaand as
they walk a ROAR OF COLOR AND SOUND WASHES OUT THE
SCREEN as seen before

FADE TO RED
FADE IN

167 EXT MOUNTAINTOP - DAY (VFX-P)

Soran is standing in front of the forcefield facing
Picard

SORAN
Now if youll excuse me Captain
I have an appointment with
Eternity and I dont want to be
late

We realize we are watching the same events play out
again

Soran turns and begins to climb up the scaffolding
toward the top of the rock face Picard drops to the
ground on his back and begins to wriggle underneath
the forcefield Picard accidentally TOUCHES the
field

turns at the sound of the field sees Picard and then
draws his weapon Soran quickly FIRES at Picard

167B THE GROUND (VFX-P)
167B

is BLASTED APART creating a cloud of dirt and debris
obscuring Picard and the whole area momentarily

-- Soran jumps down one level his disruptor still in his
hand ready just in case Picard somehow survived

Soran peers through the cloud of dust and debris

-- The dust CLEARS but Picard is gone along with
several feet of the ground where he was crawling

Soran glances up at the sky and sees the ENERGY RIBBON
then begins to climb the scaffolding Suddenly a BOOT
kicks him in the head

REVEAL KIRK

who is attacking Soran in Picards place The two men
begin to fight

NEW ANGLE (VFX-P)

as Picard rushes to the probe launcher and steps up

onto the control platform and desperately begins trying

to shut down the launcher

The following happens very quickly

-- Kirk fights with Soran hand-to-hand brutal

-- Picard works the control panel trying to make sense
of it all It wont respond The control panel is
bizarre and confusing -- many different screens and
alien graphics The alien countdown graphics continues

to race by

THE SKY (VFX-I)

the distant energy ribbon can be seen getting closer

THE MOUNTAINTOP

Soran tries to pull his disruptor but Kirk knocks it
to the ground Theres a struggle for the weapon

-- Picard looks helplessly at the control panel
Nothing he does has any effect He keeps hitting
buttonslooking for other control panels anything
to affect the launcher

ANGLE (VFX-P)

Suddenly Picard touches one particular control and the

screen CHANGES to an image of the Veridian SUN held in

the center of the alien CROSS-HAIR

PICARD (VFX-P)

begins working the control panel desperate he
looks at the screen hits a control Suddenly the
probe CLOAKS Picard reacts at his mistake Picard is
left standing on an invisible platform three feet in
the air -- a bizarre sight Picard isnt sure what to
do -- he can feel the console but he cant see any of
the controls

-- Kirk punches Soran and sends him flying backward
Soran lands heavily on the ground unconscious Kirk
stands over him breathing heavily He holds his back

in pain -- that old back pain from the beginning of the
movie
PICARD
(desperate)
Kirk -- theres a control PADD in

his right pocket

169E KIRK (VFX-P)

169E
sees Picard standing in mid-air and then reaches down
pulls the control PADD out of Sorans pocket He
begins working it
170 CLOSE ON SORAN

His eyes open he sees what Kirk is doing looks
around quickly sees the disruptor lying a few feet
away just beyond his reach

Decloaks Picard goes back to working on the controls
171A KIRK (VFX-P)
171A
he smiles
KIRK
The twenty-fourth century isnt so
tough
Without warning Kirk is BLASTED forward shot from
behind Reveal Soran on the ground with the disruptor
in his hand He gets up whirls around points the
weapon at Picard
172 MOUNTAINTOP - WIDE

The probe is suddenly LAUNCHED in a roar of flame
Soran freezes His eyes follow the probe as it arcs
into the sky The two men watch the probe as it heads

toward the sun

THE PROBE (VFX-I)

makes a sweeping turn to the right and arcs back down
toward the planet Soran watches in horror as the
probe crashes harmlessly into the distant jungle We
hear a muffled explosion

SORAN (VFX-I)

cant believe his dreams have been shattered He looks
into the sky and sees the distant ribbon streaking
overhead The disruptor falls from his hand as he
rushes to the top of the scaffolding

PICARD

moves to Kirk checks his pulse The Captains eyes
flutter -- hes still holding on but hes badly
wounded

SORAN (VFX-I)

is standing on the rock ledge He reaches up toward
the sky as if trying to grab the Ribbon with his bare
handsbut the ribbon passes by and disappears

SORAN
No

His look of shock turns to fury and madness He turns
to Picard

SORAN
you

NEW ANGLE (VFX-P)

He jumps down a few levels and then DIVES off the
scaffolding at Picard But Picard is quicker He
GRABS the disruptor and FIRES -- the BLAST CATCHES
SORAN IN MID-AIR

Soran drops to the ground a short distance away Dead
The pocket watch has been shattered

PICARD

turns back to Kirk cradles the dying mans head in his
lap Kirks eyes flick open and he takes a ragged

breath

KIRK
Nice shot

Kirk coughs His eyes flutter Hes fading fast

PICARD
Ill find a way to contact the
Enterprise Youre going to be
all right

KIRK
Did we do it Did we make a
Difference

PICARD
Yes
(beat)
Thank you

KIRK
Least I could dofor a Captain
of the Enterprise

Kirk coughs again

PICARD
Try to hang on

Kirk looks up at the sky the sunlight is warm on his
face A quiet moment then with a last smile on his

face

KIRK
It was fun

Kirk dies

Hold te scene for a long moment the two men in the
quiet clearing

DISSOLVE TO

EXT MOUNTAINTOP - SUNSET

Close on Picards hand

as he places a stone on a large pile of other stones
MOVE TO REVEAL that Picard is placing the final few
rocks on Kirks grave

He reaches into a pocket and pulls out Kirks command
insignia pin He carefully places it on the grave
and stands there silently for a few moments
A distant WHINE of engines can be heard Picard looks
up into the sky

177 PICARDS POV (VFX-I)

An Enterprise SHUTTLECRAFT is flying through the sky
toward the mountaintop

178 EXT MOUNTAINTOP - SUNSET

The shuttle has just landed and the door OPENS as
Picard enters the clearing Worf Geordi and ND
security guards jump out to meet him

WORF
Captain are you all right

PICARD
Yes

LA FORGE
What about Doctor Soran

PICARD
You neednt worry about the Doctor
anymore

Picard moves toward the shuttle then stops as he
notices that the shuttle is damaged Picard turns and
notices for the first time that La Forge has a bandage on
his face and Worfs uniform is torn

PICARD
Was there a problem with the
Klingons

Worf and La Forge exchange a look

GEORDI
You could say that

Data and Troi are looking through rubble in a different

section of the ship with tricorders Troi reacts to

Cur

Cur

something on the tricorder

TROI
Over here Data I think Ive
found something

Data moves to her with a hopeful and excited look

TROI
(off tricorder)
One life sign very faint

Data hands his tricorder to Troi and then begins to
pull debris aside with android strength

ANGLE ON DEBRIS

As Data pulls aside a large piece of plating revealing
Spot the Cat sitting in the wreckage She looks at
Data and gives a plaintive meow

DATA
(relieved)
Spot

He picks up the cat and holds it close stroking its
fur The cat purrs happily

DATA
I am very happy to find you Spot

Troi smiles

TROI
Another family reunited

Data turns revealing that there are tears in his eyes
Troi is surprised and touched at the sight

TROI
Data are you all right

DATA
I am not sure Counselor I am
happy to see Spot and yet I am

crying My emotional program must
be malfunctioning again

Picard and Riker are sifting through the rubble of what
once was the Ready Room looking for something

Riker sees something in the rubble

RIKER
Is this it

Riker holds up the family photo album seen earlier

PICARD
(relieved)
Yes Number One Thank you

He takes the album brushes off the dust and flips
through the pages for a moment Riker looks around the
wrecked room

RIKER
Im going to miss this ship She
went before her time

Picard has been rejuvenated by his experience given
a new perspective on the issues of life and death

PICARD
Its not how many years youve
ived Wil but how youve lived

them

(beat)

Someone once told me that time is
a predator that stalks us all our
ives But maybe time is also a
companion who goes with us on

our journey and reminds us to
cherish the moments of our

ives because they will never
come again
(beat)

We are after all only mortal
A quiet moment Riker finally smiles
RIKER
Speak for yourself sir I kinda

planned on living forever

Picard smiles back at him and the two men EXIT to

INT MAIN BRIDGE - DAY (VFX-P)

Riker and Picard ENTER from the Ready Room They look
around the wrecked Bridge for a moment Riker glances
at the captains chair

RIKER
I always thought Id have a crack
at this chair one day

PICARD
You may still somehow I doubt
this will be the last ship to
carry the name Enterprise

A beat then Picard hits his combadge

PICARD
