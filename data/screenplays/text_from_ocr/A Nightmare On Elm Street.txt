pressed into place (We are TOO TIGHT to see the object being
constructed)

CLOSEUP - KRISTEN PARKER

Kristen is strikingly pretty despite the dark tired circles
under her eyes Shes exhausted but desperately trying to stay
awake She wears pajamas and robe

Her head nods her eyelids close She snaps herself awake
CLOSEUP - THE RADIO

She turns the VOLUME UP EVEN LOUDER

CLOSEUP - THE CLOCK

it down with a swig of Diet Coke
CLOSEUP - PAPER MACHE

Another piece is applied

CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

Nodding off again She rouses herself angrily

WIDER ANGLE

The bedroom door opens and her mother enters ELAINE PARKER

displays her assets She snaps the radio off

KRISTEN

ELAINE
Thats right I dont

The door closes shutting Kristen into darkness She lies in bed
blinking back angry tears She turns on her side her gaze
falling on

THE PAPER MACHE OBJECT

It is a miniature house glowing weirdly in th moonlight A crude
homemade replica of the Elm Street House

CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

Staring at the tiny house hearing her mothers FAINT LAUGHTER
downstairs

Kristen begins to nod off though shes fighting it

A breeze starts up rustling her hair Leaves fall across her
pillow and face Her mothers LAUGHTER FADES OUT replaced by teh
EERIE GIGGLING of small children She awakes with a start

CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS BACK CRANING UP TO REVEAL

Kristens bed sits in the middle of the dark deserted street in
front of the Elm Street House

Small CHILDREN are playing on the lawn The boys are dressed in
suits the girls in party dresses They are jumping rope and
chanting a singsong
CHILDREN

One two Freddys coming for you

three four better lock your door

five six grab your crucifix
KRISTEN

gets out of bed and approaches the children transfixed

except for one eerily pretty LITTLE GIRL sitting on her red
tricycle near the front door hair billowing in the breezes as she
stares at Kristen

LITTLE GIRL
Hello Whats your name

KRISTEN
Kristen Whats yours

The Little Girl giggles and smiles shyly but doesnt answer

KRISTEN (cont)
What is this place

The wind kicks up MOANING We hear the SOUND OF WIND CHIMES
THE WIND CHIME

Tinkling in the wind The chimes are long razors

KRISTEN

reacts

ANOTHER ANGLE

The front door of the house CREAKS open behind the Little Girl
Darkness within

LITTLE GIRL
(sadly)

I have to go now Bye

RINGING the bell on the handlebar she pedals her tricycle through
the door and is swallowed by the darkness inside

KRISTEN
Wait Dont go in there

Too late Kristen stands alone Fighting her fear she
approaches the house

INT ELM STREET HOUSE - NIGHT

Kristen enters The place is barren empty Broken windows
flaking paint rotted walls Leaves skitter across teh floor

KRISTEN
Little girl

THE CHILDREN

They sense her presence and turn their vacant staring eyes toward
her They scatter vanishing into the shadows

She hears the JINGLING of the tricycle bell and the GIGGLING of
the Little Girl ECHOING FAINTLY from deep inside the house Then
silence again Kristen tries to follow the sounds

ANOTHER ANGLE

Kristen comes around a corner just in time to see

HER POV

A quick glimpse of the Little Girl vanishing around the corner at
the far end of a long twisted corridor The walls are streaked
with rustor perhaps dried blood

KRISTEN

She keeps following Being led

ANOTHER ANGLE

Kristen comes around a corner and finds herself facing a heavy
steel door that is just closing wiht a SOLID METALLIC CLANG The

riveted metal seems out of place in the rotted wood house

Kristen goes to the door and pulls it slowly open A stairway
leading down into darkness

STAIRWAY
Kristen carefully makes her way down the metal steps
INT BOILER ROOM

Kristen fearfully enters Freddys decrepit lair Ancient rusted
boilers stand cold and silent in the shadows

The SOFT JINGLE of the tricycle draws Kristens attention
ANOTHER ANGLE

The Little Girl pedals out of the darkness and comes to a stop
before Kristen

LITTLE GIRL
This is where he takes us

There is a SCREECH OF METAL Kristen whirls and sees

A BOILER

The rusted furnace door is swinging open metal grating on metal
Inside the charred bones of children lie in heaps of cold ash A
tricycle lies in the carnage identical to the Little Girls --
only charred

KRISTEN

Horrified Suddenly a METAL DOOR SLAMS LOUDLY in the darkness
THUDDING FOOTSTEPS approach BOOMING CLOSER
THE LITTLE GIRL
looks up at Kristen with sad eyes
LITTLE GIRL
(eerily calm)
Freddys home

THE BOILER FURNACE

Now alive with ROARING FLAMES The tricycles paint bubbles and
scorches in the intense heat

KRISTEN

scoops the Little Girl into her arms and runs in blind terror
She glances back over her shoulder to see

FREDDY

looming from the row of boilers an indistinct silhouette in the
hellish smoke and flames His maniacal LAUGHTER ECHOES through
the chamber

KRISTEN

ducks through a doorway into another room still carrying the
Little Girl

INT ROOM

A hundred teenage bodies hang from teh ceiling strung up in the
darkness like butchered meat

KRISTEN

gazes in horror She looks down at the Little Girl cradled in her

arms -- she is now a horribly charred brittle corpse Suddenly
her tiny mouth bursts open emitting a ghastly ear-splitting
SCREAM

SHOCK CUT TO
CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

As she sits bolt upright in bed panting in terror face bathed in
sweat She looks around recognizing her own room

She gets out of bed and walks unsteadily to the bathroom
INT - BATHROOM
She clicks on the light and looks at her reflection in the mirror

Still trembling she runs water in the sink and splashes her face
trying to calm down
The water becomes too hot Steam rises

She tries to turn the water off but the pressure increases

She fiddles with the handle confused

As she turns it the four-pronged handle suddenly springs to life

leering from the mirror laughing The claw hand rises up into

CLOSEUP - KRISTEN

SCREAMING as the blades slash downward

CLOSEUP - FREDDY

Grinning as a spray of blood hits the mirror

THE BATHROOM DOOR
bursts open revealing Kristens mother

REVERSE ANGLE - THE BATHROOM

She SCREAMS

No steam The mirror and sink are normalexcept for the thin

streaks of spattered blood

Kristen turns to her mother slowly waking from her dream
holds a bloody razor in her hand Her wrist is slashed

EXT WESTIN HILLS PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY

Isolated and somewhat gothic its an enormous multi-winged
structure built by the Catholic Church in the 1920s A belltower
is centerpiece to several rambling wings Originally an insane
asylum it is now a modernized state-run facility An iron fence
surrounds the sprawling grounds

INT HOSPITAL - ADOLESCENT WING - DAY

DOLLYING with MAX the burly black Chief Orderly as he makes his
morning rounds He wheels a rolling cart containing a variety of
medications down the hall A NEWSCASTERS VOICE comes from the
small portable radio dangling from the cart

NEWSCASTER
In local nows two more teenage deaths
have occurred -- both suicides County

health officials are at a loss to explain
this alarming trend --

Grimacing Max switches to a music station as DOCTOR NEIL GOLDMAN
(early 30s) bright and intense falls in step

NEIL
(absorbed in a clipboard
of patients charts)
Nothing like a little cheery news to start
the day

MAX
Say listen Doc I got a new theory about
all these suicides

NEIL
Dont hold back on us Max We need all
the help we can get

MAX
Fucked up chromosomes man Think about
it Their parents all dropped acid in
the Sixties

NEIL
It beats Dr Simms theory She thinks
its nothing but sex drugs and rock
and roll

MAX
Shit thats what keeps people alive

Max exits frame Neil continues on JENNIFER a girl of 14
approaches
NEIL
Good morning Jennifer

JENNIFER
Morning Doctor Goldman
NEIL
Hows your hand
She extends her hand for inspection -- it is scarred with

cigarette burns She points to three different welts

JENNIFER
Menthol regular ultra-light

NEIL
Theyre healing up nicely

JENNIFER

priveleges back

NEIL
Dont hold your breath

Jennifer shrugs It was worth a try She moves on

TARYN a 17 year old blonde approaches She appears exhausted
dark tired circles under her eyes

NEIL
Hi Taryn You dont look so hot kid

Been getting any sleep

She ignores him Neil watches her float past then jots a note on
his clipboard

NEIL (cont)
Didnt think so

ANOTHER ANGLE

Neil comes to the Quiet Room and peers through the small mesh-grid
window

NEILS POV - (QUIET ROOM)

KINCAID an enormous and powerful-looking 17 year old with a
shaved head is huddled in the corner of the white padded room
gazing at nothing

NEIL - (HALLWAY)

makes a notation on his clipboard DOCTOR ELIZABETH SIMMS the
hospital superior appears at his elbow
SIMMS
How is he

NEIL
Cooling down

SIMMS
If he continues having these outbursts

NEIL
Dont worry it wont come to that

They exit frome CAMERA PUSHES UP to teh mesh-grid window of the
Quiet Room for a shot of Kincaid

CLOSEUP - KINCAID - (QUIET ROOM)
He stares into space singing softly under his breath

KINCAID
I aint gonna dream no more no more

gonna dream no more

DOLLYING WITH NEIL AND SIMMS - (HALLWAY)
NEIL
I read the report on our new staff
member
SIMMS

What did you think

NEIL
Frankly I dont understand why some
grad school superstar is being treated
like a seasoned pro

SIMMS
Shes been doing ground-breaking
research on pattern nightmares

NEIL
Elizabeth we dont need any outside

want some hot-shot taking chances
with them just so she can get published

Simms is about to say more but is interrupted by

They hurry down the hall

Kristens mother near hysteria is loudly berating a NURSE

ELAINE
Dont give me that shit Shes just
trying to get attention thats all
Im not playing her little game any-
more

Neil and Simms rush past into the examination room
INT EXAMINATION ROOM

Neil and Simms burst into a chaotic struggle Kristen is going
berserk fighting the STAFF as they try to restrain her and
wrestle her onto a gurney -- the gurney goes crashing into the
wall A frantic NURSE addresses Neil

NURSE
Suicide attempt They just brought her
in from County General

NEIL

NURSE
Kristen Parker She was fine until we
tried to sedate her

Her face contorted with terror Kristen kicks and bites and
scratches as ORDERLIES try to pin her

ORDERLY
Watch it She tore her stiches out

NEIL
Kristen we want to help you

ANOTHER ANGLE

Max enters and takes immediate control he shoves everybody out
of the way spins Kristen effortlessly around and pins her arms
firmly from behind She tries to struggle but hes too strong
She weakens

MAX
(compassionate)
Calm down baby sister thats enough
nonsense for now

Neil takes a hypo from the nurse and approaches Kristen slowly

NEIL
Kristen Im Doctor Goldman Im not
going to hurt you Im just going to
give you something to help you sleep
CUT TO

KRISTEN goes berserk again and kicks Neil in the stomach Max is
thrown off balance and crashes into a rolling cart -- medical
instruments shower to the floor

Kristen grabs a pair of wicked-looking surgical scissors She
slashes at maxs hand drawing blood

NEIL
Back off Max

Kristen huddles into a corner ready to skewer anybody who gets
close A tense stand-off

NEIL (cont)
Kristen put the scissors down No-
bodys gonna hurt you

But the girl makes no move to drop her guard She starts rocking
back and forth coming apart at the seams moaning a little song

KRISTEN
Five six grab your crucifix

She cant seem to find the words in her confused mind

NANCY (0OS)
Never sleep again

beauty and great inner strength her hair still bears the white

streak She speaks as if coming out of a trance

NANCY
Who taught you that rhyme

KRISTEN

Her eyes are locked with Nancys

The staff members part before her as she walks to Kristen She
takes the scissors from Kristens hand Kristen falls into

IN TIGHT on her face We hear the DISTANT GHOSTLY JINGLING of a
tricycle bell Her eyes slowly open

Kristen watches terrified as a tricycle rolls into the room by
itself leaving bloody tire tracks The same tricycle that
belonged to the Little Girl

The door swings open Kristen emerges from a solid wall of water
and steps into the room She is magically dry

REVERSE ANGLE

It is the Elm Street living room foreboding and nearly barren of
furniture

A large lump forms under the rug at the far end of the room and
undulates toward her sinuously A long tubular shape

Kristen backs away

The shape circles her aimlessly then slithers up the wall -- a
huge writhing entity traveling within the wall surface

The shape arcs back down toward the carpet and disappears below
the floorline

Kristen turns about apprehensively searching for the mysterious
entity Beat

Suddenly the creatures erupts through the floor directly beneath
her in a shower of wood splinters engulfing her legs as it
rockets straight up It slams back down like a whale surfacing
Kristen locked firmly in its jaws

THE CREATURE

encrusted with mucous and slime Its slavering jaws dislocate
like a snakes the skin stretching grotesquely as it begins to

Your dreams

TARYN
(softly)
Hey everybody has bad dreams

PHILLIP
Can I interject something here Just
to save us all some time

NEIL
Go ahead Phillip
PHILLIP
(to Nancy)

According to our kind hosts our dreams
are a group psychosis Sort of a mellow
mass hysteria The fact that we all
dreamt about this guy before we ever

met doesnt seem to impress anybody

The kids murmur in agreement

PHILLIP (cont)
So we go in circles making minimal
progress with maximum effort

SIMMS
And you wont make any progress until
you can recognize your dreams for what
they are

NANCY
And what are they

SIMMS
The by-product of guilt Psychological
scars steaming from moral conflicts and
overt sexuality

KINCAID
Great Now its my dick thats killing
me

KRISTEN

Tell them Nancy Tell them whats
really going on

NEIL
(surprised)
Yes tell us Nancy
NANCY

All I can say is this isnt something
thats just going to disappear youre
all going to have to face it Fight it
And if youre willing to work together
wiling to stand up to your deepest
fearsI think we can beat it

PANNING THE KIDS

Their expressions reflect a quiet mix of hope and fear They are
impressed -- all except Kincaid

KINCAID
My deepest fear is listening to any more
of this rah-rah bullshit

Marcie pushes Joey gently back on the bed and crawls on top of him

Marcie kisses his mouth her tongue probing deeply

Too deeply Joey gags and draws back -- but Marcies tongue grows
supernaturally long and burrows deeper into his mouth

Choking he grabs the writhing tongue and tries to pull it out of
his mouth

CLOSEUP - MARCI

The tail end of her tongue leaps out of her mouth with a life of
its own

back twining around the bedpost like a bullwhip

swarming in its dessicated flesh

Taryn nimbly dodges and whirls producing two large gravity
knives She click-clacks them open twirling them expertly

TARYN
Okay asshole Lets dance

Freddy gives her an evil smile and squares off against her
They circle each otehr slowlythen Freddy lashes out
Taryn ducks and cuts deeply across Freddys ribs

Freddy SCREAMS with anger and swipes twice more ripping deep
gouges in Taryns shoulder

Taryn draws back keeping her guard up She feints then strikes
out slashing Freddy again

This time Freddy draws back
FREDDY
Tarynwhy should we fight You and
I are old friends

Taryn stands poised ready for anything

CLOSEUP - FREDDY

FREDDY
(grinning)
Lets get high
He raises his hands into frame -- his fingerhave all turned into

oversized hypodermic neeles their needle-sharp tips glittering in
the darkness

TARYN

Revolted by teh weird display She looks down feeling something
strange

CLOSEUP - TARYNS ARMS

Her needle track scars are expanding and contracting like tiny
sucking mouthshungry

WIDER

The instant her guard is down Freddy lunges at her and buries
both sets of hypodermic fingers into her arms pinning her to the
wall Taryn SCREAMS

CLOSEUP - HYPO FINGERS

As their inner plunges depress Taryns biceps swell grotesquely
veins bulging impossibly

TARYN
We can actually see the high-pressure fluid travel upward as her
veins and body balloon racing from her arms -- her neck swells --

temples expand -- eyeballs bulge --

Then the top of her head literally exploded
CLOSEUP - FREDDY

FREDDY

CUT TO
INT ELM STREET BASEMENT - NIGHT
MOVING WITH Will -- he holds a torch high in one hand a saber in

the other He looks like a thin pirate out of a Dungeons and
Dragons game

WILL
(calling out)
Hello You guys where are you

He heas a SOUND somewhere in the darkness ahead He
pausesnothing Suddenly theres a SOUND OF SCREECHING METAL
and a strange object comes racing out of the darkness at him He
lunges out of the way

THE OBJECT

screeches to a halt and wheels about Its an oversiezed
nightmarish version of Wills wheelchair -- made of rusty twisted
metal and bristling with spikes and hooks To sit in it would be

agonizing death

FREDDY (0OS)
You look tired Will Have a seat

REVERSE ANGLE

Will whirls about to see Freddy leaning nonchalantly against a

pillar
WILL
(shaken)
No thanks Im fine just the way I am
FREDDY
For now But when you wake up
(singing)
youre back in the saddle again
Will is visibly upset by this -- and reacts too slowly as the

wheelchair bears down on him again
WILL
is sideswiped and knocked to the ground his leg bleeding

THE CHAIR
spins around preparing for another run
FREDDY

FREDDY

him as crackling electricity plays across his fingertips just
like the illustration on the Dungeonmaster game card

Green lightning explodes from his fingertips and shatters the
wheelchair into fragments

FREDDY
reacts in surprise
WILL
looks up at Freddy grinning with his newfound power The dancing
lights emanating from his fingers cast a weird glow across his
face
WILL
In the name of Elric Prince of Elves --
demon begone

WIDER

Will rushes at Freddy shooting wizards fire The crackling
green energy engulfs Freddy completely --

-- but Freddy grabs Will by the front of his shirt and lifts him
off the ground

CLOSER

Freddy snarls into Wills face as the living energy twines around
him

FREDDY
Sorry kid I dont believe in fairy
tales
Freddy buries his claws in Wills chest -- the blades points jut

out of Wills back as his death cry ECHOES down teh halls

She turns a corner and sees Nancy at the end of a hallway

KRISTEN (cont)

They rush toward each other -- but stop as they hear a strange
CRUNCHING SOUND

KRISTEN
Whats that
NANCY
I dont know
The SOUND comes again -- a horrible CRACKING AND SNAPPING The

wall begins to spiderweb with cracks as it bulges outward
Something big seems to be trying to press through to cut them off
from each other Nancy and Kristen back away warily

Suddenly there is an EXPLOSION of wood and plaster -- and Kincaid
steps through

KINCAID
(grinning)
Yo I thought I heard voices

Nancy and Kristen yell with delight Kristen throws her arms
around him

KRISTEN
Kincaid I could kiss you

KINCAID

Kristen is taken aback for a moment -- then gives him a chaste but
sincere kiss on the mouth He grins

KINCAID

Suddenly the lights around them flinker and dim They hear a
DEEP REVERBERATING GROAN OF METAL All look over the railing

OVER THE SHOULDER

as they peer downward Where before there was nothing there are
now two huge rusty boiler room doors slowly swinging open like
the entrance to Hell Orange light flickers from below

KINCAID

Still finishing his prior statement

KINCAID

before the immense gate Within lies flickering darkness and
twisting steps leading down

NANCY

Kristen nods

KINCAID

They descend

INT BOILER ROOM - ENTRANCE

Nancy Kristen and Kincaid cautiously come down the winding
stairs and pass under an arch way made of twisted scorched
tricycles and shattered dolls

They exchange worried looks then step through

MASTER

A surrealistic boiler room air red with heat and haze

Freddy sits on a throne made of childrens skulls and bones

Joey is nearby suspended over the pit of flames like a weird
altar

Welcome to Freddy Hell

FREDDY
FREDDY
(low gutteral chuckle)
Look Joeyall the little piggies have
come home
JOEY

He turns his terrified pleading eyes toward his friends His
skin is hot and blistered The tongues that lash his hands and
feet to the four posts are writhing slowly licking his ankles and
wrists He opens his mouth in a mute silent scream
NANCY KRISTEN KINCAID
KRISTEN
(softly)

Nancy steps forward

NANCY
Let him go

THE THRONE
Freddy sweeps his hands the obedient servant

FREDDY
Your wish is my command
He makes a gesture
JOEY

The tonguecreature securing his left wrist unravels -- he drops
precariously The other tongues begin to loosen their hold

NANCY

lunges to the edge of the pit reaching for Joey
FREDDY

laughs maniacally

THE PIT

The last tongues give way and Joey drops --

-- just as Nancy snatches his wrist and hangs on Kincaid grabs
Nancy by the belt and hauls them both back out

KRISTEN

With a cry she runs and does a double flip over the burning
pit -- right at Freddy

THE THRONE

Kristen snap-kicks right into Freddys face toppling him and the
throne backwards

KINCAID

strains as he rips a six-foot section of pipe from the wall and
races toward the throne

NANCY

helps Joey to his feet just as a tonguecreature flies out of the
darkness and whips around her neck strangling her

FREDDY

rises from the rubble of his throne and lashes at Kristen She
flips over his head -- but Freddy backhands her sending her
spinning across the room

NANCY

Clutching one end of the writhing tongue she forces it to the
ground She grabs a furnace poker and skewers the creature It

instantly unravels from her neck

THE FALLEN THRONE
As Freddy prepares to slash Kristen Kincaid races in swinging
his pipe in a wide arc It smashes across Freddys back driving
him to his knees

Kincaid raises the pipe for a second blow but Freddy leaps up
with a ROAR and grabs Kincaid hauling him high over his head

Nancy rushes in just as Freddys arms are extended and plunges the
poker into his heart

Everyone freezes
FREDDY

looks down at the poker with an exaggerated gasp -- then flashes a
grin at Nancy

NANCY

reacts in horror

FREDDY

releases Kincaids feet and holds him dangling by the throat
With his free hand he pulls the poker slowly from his chest He
looks at the tip -- it glistens with dark rancid gore He licks
it like an ice cream cone

NANCY AND KRISTEN

Kristen rises using Nancy for support

KRISTEN
Nancy

NANCY
Hes too strong He was never this
strong

FREDDY
whirls to her Kincaid still choking in his upraised fist

INT BOILER ROOM - NIGHT

that somebodys disturved his bones His fear is slowly replaced

by an evil cunning grin

He vanishes -- Kincaid finds himself struggling and choking in
mid-air He drops to the ground gasping for breath

EXT AUTO GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

Thompson crawls from the shallow grave and throws the shovel
aside

THOMPSON
What the hell good is this supposed to
do

Ignoring him Neil picks up the tire iron and holds it up

NEIL

He jams the tire iron into the ground at the foot of the grave
It looks like a cross

THOMPSON
(hears something)
What was that

NEIL

Listen

Neil now hears the FAINT SOUND OF ROCK MUSIC on the night breeze

Sympathy for the Devil

INT WRECKED CHEVY
We can see Neil and Thompson through the cracked windshield of the
rusted-out Chevy The radio suddenly lights up blaring another
rock song

More MUSIC comes from all around them blasting from teh radios of
long-dead autos a cacophony of rock songs from the 50s and 60s
We hear the HOWLING of Wolfman Jack

Broken headlights sputter to life A windshield wiper near
Thompson slaps madly back and forth across shattered glass Horns
honk An exposed fan blade WHIRRS like a buzzsaw
NEIL AND THOMPSON
THOMPSON
(hoarse whisper)

The whole place is coming to life

Both men turn to look at the burlap sack There is a slight
stirring from within

Neil hurries over and grabs the sack to throw it into the grave
THE SACK

Suddenly a skeletal hand wearing finger-razors tears through the
rotted burlap and latches onto Neils wrist
The sack rips wide open as Freddys charred bones leap into
life -- a hideous shambling skeleton SCREAMING with unearthly
rage

THOMPSON

Frozen to the spot Cant believe his eyes

NEIL

falls back scrambling away as Freddys blades slash the air
inches in front of his face

WIDER

Suddenly Jesse the junkyard dog hurtles out of the darkness onto
the hellish things back biting and snapping

The skeleton pulls the dog from its back slashes its throat in
one quick motion and tosses the carcass aside

THOMPSON
Something snaps in him as he glares at the skeleton

THOMPSON
Its really you

It turns and grins hideously at Thompson
THOMPSON

off his feet

It hurls Thompson through the air with incredible force
THE CADILLAC

Thompson slams into it impaled on the tail fin He looks down at
the metal point jutting from his chestand dies

NEIL

grabs the shovel and swings it -- the skeleton ducks and slashes
Neils ribs ripping his shirt wide open
CUT TO

As Neil doubles over the skeleton rips the shovel from his hands
and smashes it solidly against his head Before Neil can crumple
the creature straightens him up with a second vicious blow -- we
hear BONE CRACK Neil falls back into the grave

The skeleton shrieks with unholy laughter and begins to shovel the
loose dirt onto Neil

It tosses the shovel aside raises its arms into the air with a
victorious HOWL -- and collapses into a pile of bones
