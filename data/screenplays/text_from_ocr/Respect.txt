much more

records on the wall

There can sometimes be a lack of
effortlessness of the kind you find in
a Lena Horne or Dorothy Dandridge but
what Aretha lacks in formal education
she has more than made up for in
experience

Aretha walks around the office and looks at all the gold
records and artists photos on the wall She’s impressed and
badly wants that success and validation

She has performed before every type of
crowd imaginable from small churches

That demon is back

(to Hammond)
Ree has a tendency to indulge in
her pain

ARETHA
Can we talk about this somewhere
else

cL

(to Hammond)
John it’s important that you
understand that her behavior is not a
reflection of her upbringing or her
race

HAMMOND
I worked with Bessie Smith and Billie
Holiday Aretha is a saint in
comparison

cL
She wasn’t raised in whorehouses
like them She was raised ina
proper home with every convenience
and luxury But still there was
this darkness that would descend on
her I called it the demon She
locks herself away won’t speak
eat or move She just wallows
in whatever imaginary pain

Aretha in anger knocks down music stand then immediately
regrets it CL and Hammond are taken aback They’ve never
seen such emotion from her

CL (CONTD)
You told me before we came out here
you had it under control

ARETHA
(barely above a whisper)

having hits This is why you don’t
have hits Acting like a trifling
nigg

forget about this and

wrote a good song for Aretha “I
Never Loved a Man”

JERRY
I’ve got the perfect place for you

this little studio in Alabama
TED

Aretha has only recorded in New

York

JERRY

Which is part of the problem It’s
overproduced too polished These

boys down there

TED
Boys

JERRY

Don’t be offended I call them boys
because they’re young like Areth
Miss Franklin not because they’re
Negroes But they’re the best
musicians I have ever worked with
in my life They know how to riff
and play off each other They don’t
need to read charts They just feel

it out

INT FAME STUDIO LIVE ROOM - LATER - DAY

The liquor bottle’s on the table Everyone listens to the
demo recording of “I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)”
sung by the songwriter a black male It is a slow mediocre
blues record nothing at all like the iconic version It’s
obvious Rick and the Musicians which in addition to Jack
includes ROGER HAWKINS (Drums) TOMMY COGBILL JIMMY JOHNSON
(Guitar) CHARLIE CHALMERS (tenor sax) JOE ARNOLD (sax) and
DAVID HOOD (trombone) hate it

RICK
Who’s this singing
TED
The songwriter

The Musicians laugh

JIMMY
He sings like a writer

ROGER
Rick you want drums on this or you
just want to keep it boring

RICK
I don’t know Roger You know any
good drummers around here

ROGER
I don’tactually

JIMMY
(resong)
Just slow A little slow

The Musicians nod in agreement

JERRY
Come on guys Hang with me It’s a
good song

It is what it is

The demo ends Aretha sits down at the piano

JERRY
Let’s see what we can make of it

the shuffle or straighten it out

SPOONER
Let’s straighten it out

Straighten her out

Chips plays a riff

CHIPS
Put some fatback on it

A King Curtis deal

Jimmy plays a riff

That’s groovy man

Roger twirls his sticks is about to hit the drums when
Aretha plays a B7 chord on the piano that draws everyone’s
attention Rick Ted Tom and Jerry go into the Control
Booth

CHIPS
Alright Let’s go with that

Chips answers with a soulful guitar riff Aretha plays a
gospel version of the song Roger joins in with a backbeat
and soon all the players settle into a tempo Aretha sings
an inspired version of the song that is clearly better than
the demo Jerry interrupts

JERRY

They exchange glances

Aretha continues to play oblivious to everyone else Spooner
watches her closely

JACK
Well my horn arrangement is
killer Y’all let me know when
youre ready for it

TOMMY
You think you gonna save the song
Jack

JACK

As I have on many an occasion
Aretha starts humming along with the tune she’s playing

Spooner plays what Aretha is humming on his Wulitzer and we
hear one of the most famous song intros in recorded music
The Band and Aretha look at each other They know this is
what the song was missing

CHIPS
Spooner’s got it Spooner’s got it

Spooner continues to play his riff while Tommy supports him
with a simple pulsing baseline Roger finds his groove on the
drums While the rhythm section settles on a beat Jack
finishes his chart and silently shows the horn players their
cues Aretha eyes each musician and nods approval She looks
last at Jack who smiles as she begins to sing

ARETHA
Youre a no good heart breaker
Youre a liar and youre a cheat
And I dont know why
I let you do these things to me
My friends keep telling me
That you aint no good
But oh they dont know
That Id leave you if I could

Jacks eyes are locked on Aretha as he cues the horn section
to enter at the B section The saxes and trumpet provide the
perfect counterpoint as the vocal continues Ted watches all
of this with jealousy and admiration

ARETHA (CONTD)
I guess Im uptight
And Im stuck like glue
Cause I aint never
I aint never I aint never no
no (loved a man)
(The way that I I love you)

The song bleeds seamlessly into the next scene where

gospel
JACK

And sex Baby that’s some of the
best singing and playing I ever
heard

Jack puts his arm around Aretha Aretha still thinking about
the song is not paying attention and her arms remain limply
at her side Jack does not remove his arm from around Aretha
until she turns to Jerry shaking his arm loose

ARETHA
I want to overdub some backup
vocals on the chorus

JERRY
