falling in love with isn’t in his grade It’s BELLA the

wearing white sunglasses and blushing like crazy

- A fun nerdy group of seven is at the Airbrush Station Mr
Airbrush writes “Scintillating Seven” on a hat The friends
crack up They think it’s the funniest thing ever

- All the kids watch a montage video of the Bat Mitzvah girl
growing up with all her friends Andrew is looking around He
discreetly stands up and goes to the hallway

- Andrew sees Bella on the phone and hides behind a column so
she won’t see him Bella is really sad She wipes tears and
talks quietly After hanging up she gets back into work mode
and walks back to the party Andrew goes unseen

Back to the opening slow motion shot He fell in love because
she was sad “Orchard” reshapes into “Cha Cha Slide” and
were in real time again WIDE of Bella leading the dance

her big smile

Youre very sweet She won’t dance
it’s okay

Domino looks at Lola in the distance So does Andrew Lola is
working on her Rubik’s cube while her peers are slow dancing

DOMINO (CONTD)
Lola’s autistic That’s why she’s
working on her cube at the Bat
Mitzvah party Not because the
party is game themed

ANDREW
Is that hard

DOMINO
Sure Yeah Not because of her

Domino looks around the party eyes welling Andrew gets it

ANDREW
I’m sorry Sometimes I think I
might be a little autistic

DOMINO
You do

ANDREW
- Well no-

Domino smiles big then laughs Andrew smiles

ANDREW (CONT’D) DOMINO
That wasn’t real-- --I don’t (thinks he’s a cutie)
know-I do think I can get her --You were just trying to
on the dance floor though connect--

DOMINO (CONT’D)
Id give you a thousand dollars

ANDREW

DOMINO
No I’ll just give it to you

ANDREW
Well that’s no fun How about I bet
you 300 dollars she dances with me

DOMINO
I give you 300 if you win and you
give me 100 if I win so it’s fair

ANDREW
How is that fair

DOMINO
‘Cause I know my daughter and I
know your chances are slim to none

ANDREW
Okay but I know myself

DOMINO
Okay let’s bet 20 instead of 300

ANDREW
20 Do you think I’m 20

DOMINO
I don’t know how old you are

ANDREW
I’m not 20 Let’s keep it even at
300 And get me a drink please so I
can celebrate my winnings

Andrew walks over to Lola We stay with Domino as she
watches From a distance we see Andrew talking and Lola not
making eye contact It’s not going well Then Andrew pulls up
a chair next to her and says something that makes Lola smile
Domino is intrigued Then Lola puts her headphones on and
stands up and walks to the dance floor with Andrew Domino is
shocked Andrew twirls Lola around as Domino’s heart races
for her kid

Lola pushes her headphones to her ears All the kids who were
just slow dancing are now thrilled about “Crank That” and are
also still on the high of slow dancing It’s rowdy Lola is
looking like she might dip Domino has walked over

DOMINO
That was some of the best twirling
I’ve ever seen

LOLA

I think I will go sit back down
DOMINO

You sure
LOLA

I do not know how to “crank that”

ANDREW DOMINO

LOLA

Lola is pacing a few steps off the dance floor (here”)
She’s not just pacing though She’s also grooving

Like she’s dancing every once in a while with just her arms
Then with just her legs Like it’s clear she still wants to
dance

DOMINO
Are you still grooving

Andrew starts grooving subtly too with Lola Then Domino
starts It’s hella cute Their own version of “crankin that”

ANDREW
It really is so cool you collect
potato mashers Is there a reason
you like them or like collecting
them Or do you have any favorite
facts about potato mashers

LOLA
Well the first potato masher was a
rock followed by a hand-shaped
masher made of wood With the
machine age the wood masher
evolved into a machine-turned
wooden mallet

(MORE )

LOLA (CONT’D)
In the late 1800s two masher types
of the modern design emerged The
most popular has an S wound wire
that is flat at the bottom or
sometimes a round or square wire
grid that is flat at the bottom
Because of the room between there
is never the worry of over-mashing
the potatoes The other type of
masher has a round disc with holes
drilled into it but it can over
mash the potatoes That is all I
want to talk about I want to fall
asleep now

ANDREW
Okay You brushed your teeth and
fed Jerry right

LOLA
Yes of course

ANDREW
Sorry mom isn’t here to scratch
your back Do you want me to read
you a story while you fall asleep
Or like sleep on the ground

do not mean to be brutal

kick your ass

can’t remember what better feels
like sometimes And then you do
things that you think will make you
feel better but they dont They
make it worse And the things that
Im really scared of doing are
probably the things that will help
me the most but I just cant do
them

Andrew takes this is in and tries to connect After a beat
he’s thinking of his mom

ANDREW
My mom is bipolar so when I was a
kid she was really depressed
sometimes and um one time I asked
her what it was like and she said
for some people it feels like it
might be easier to just be sad
She tries though

DOMINO
Everybody tries

ANDREW
I understand that depression is
really good at making your brain
think things that aren’t true So
like- I don’t know-I just wish you
and my mom would listen to other
people not your brain And not just
other people but like good people

Domino smiles at him Andrew is really in love and wants to
be with her forever

ANDREW (CONT’D)
Do you know what you look like

No and I don’t want to Everything

thinking I want to go to college
and Chicago has more options I
have this feeling like my real life
is happening there

ANDREW
You should definitely go to school

DOMINO
I knew you were gonna say that

ANDREW
You should go here though so I can
babysit every time you have to do
school when Lola’s at home

DOMINO
I had a dream that I was working on
the common app for college But
Lola was there and I couldn’t
focus And you came in and asked if
I was ready to turn the app in And
I started freaking out because I
hadn’t even started And then you
told me there’s plenty of time And
I had side-swept bangs an-

-Domino’s eyes well up
ANDREW
Did the side-swept bangs look awful
is that why your eyes are welling-
-Domino laughs and says “yeah” She gathers herself

Lola’s dad for a few years

ANDREW
No
DOMINO

He left

(beat)
I want to thank you for being so
kind to Lola I hold on tight to
the fact that Lola is closest to
me But one day god willing I’m not
gonna be around for her You remind-

(-tearing up)

You remind me how easy it is to

make Lola feel good and safe I
don’t need to guard her so much

ANDREW
Yeah I bet it’s scary thinking
about who would take care of her if
youre not there But David is the
best and he’s gonna be her friend
forever Also I’m only ten years
older than her and eat well And
for Lola when I’m 50 I’1l marry a
girl who’s awesome and way younger
than me and she’1ll hang with Lola

DOMINO
For Lola you’ll marry a babe who’s
way younger than you

ANDREW
I didn’t say babe- you assumed that-

-Domino laughs Then there’s a long beat

DOMINO
I want you to be in Lola’s life
but I don’t think I want you to
babysit anymore

things you aren’t saying to me And
there’s things I’m not saying to
you
(MORE)

ANDREW (CONTD)
But like with you I can’t tell
whether you’re holding back a
desire to be distant or to be
close For me it’s holding back a
desire to be close

thought about this So much

someone and learn to trust that
they’1l love you

night so I didn’t have a chance to
think over everything I wanted to
tell you

(beat)
It’s not hard for me to commit just
because I’ve been left before

ANDREW
You realized it’s hard because
youre deeply in love with me

DOMINO
(smiling)
Yeah But that’s not what I was
gonna say What I was gonna say-

um-
(-already fighting tears)
It’s hard to accept the fact
that I’ll have lived a whole life-

ANDREW
Where you’re never not settled

DOMINO
Yeah Right before I leave earth
Ill have always been bogged down

This is sad but it’s okay She isn’t sitting in the sadness
What she’s getting at is actually about Andrew

DOMINO (CONTD)
I have so much to figure out And
I wish that Lola could’ve been born
after- But she wasn’t She came
when I had acne and I was a mess
and then my life was being defined
by her stages Then Joseph came
along And I’m thankful But the
rest of my life is gonna be defined
by them But for you- Your
life is being defined by only you
right now How scary but how
awesome that you have the
opportunity to figure stuff out
before other people get involved

Tears are coming down Andrew’s face
ANDREW
I think you’re really great And

I’m sorry that- I’m sorry

DOMINO
It’s okay Thanks
