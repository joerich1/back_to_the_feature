FUZZIES

Second Draft

FADE IN

Deep in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado a beautiful wintery
landscape Pine trees are everywhere with branches that
hang heavy with deep powdered snow

We PAN across the lovely mountain vista and finally SETTLE
on a LONG SHOT of a little town that lies right in the

middle of the Rockies A TITLE reads ’MALA VISTA l Arde
COLORADO - RECENTLY’

EXT MALA VISTA - DAY

Mala Vista is an extremely quaint and charming mountain
town so quaint and charming that it almost makes you want
to vomit Small wooden buildings line a single unpaved
road A few happy TOWNSPEOPLE walk hither and thither - and
even some lovely Christmas decorations add to the merry
ambiance

Suddenly the peaceful scene is interrupted by a child’s
loud voice OFF CAMERA that is singing a bizarre song

CHILD’S VOICE (0S)
(Singing)
Bacon and Cheese and Carrots and
Peas And Carrots and Peas and
Bacon and Cheese

The Camera MOVES as if looking for the source of the voice

WHIP PAN TO

EXT FOREST TRAIL - MALA VISTA

JOE MITCHELL a VERY strange looking nine year-old boy with
thick glasses is walking down a crude path heading into Mala
Vista from a large group of trees The way he walks and

talks it is immediately apparent that he has a mental
disability

Little Joe is wearing a wooden chest plate to act as a crude
piece of armor an old cooking pot on his head as a helmet
and absolutely nothing else Luckily his chest plate hangs
low enough to cover his privates but it seems the kid must
be FREEZING in the snowy surroundings But instead of
looking cold Joe proudly swings a wooden sword in his hand
back and forth as he continues his powerful song

JOE
(Singing)
Fight the Blue Horned Fuzzies
Fight with all your heart
(MORE)

JOE (cont’d)
Bacon and cheese and carrots and
Peas And Cheese and Bacon and
Carrots

Joe passes one of the quaint Mala Vista homes A WOMAN has
just pulled her car into the driveway of the house and is
emerging with a bag of groceries under her arm

JOE
Hello Mrs Bacon and Cheese

WOMAN
(rolling her eyes)
Hello Joe

JOE
I been fighting Blue Horned Fuzzies
in the woods behind your house

WOMAN
That’s nice Joe

JOE
Peas and carrots

WOMAN
Go away Joe

JOE
(dappily)
Okay
The woman sighs and shakes her head as Joe prances on down
the road
EXT PORCH OF A HOUSE - MALA VISTA
From a rocking chair on his wooden porch a middle-aged
rugged looking man VANCE watches as Joe marches by still
singing his fighting song
VANCE
Hey put some clothes o yyou crazy
kid If your mom catche ou naked
again shell whip your butt

JOE
Hellq pir Peas and grapes

Joe does some flips that resemble cartwheels down the road

“VANCE
Damn that kid’s nuttier than
zucchini bread

Another man PAP very old and VERY senile is playing
checkers with himself

PAP
Hah

VANCE
I say the kid’s nuttier than
zucchini bread

PAP
Aw to hell with you

EXT SNOW BANK - CONTINUOUS

Three ten year old boys wearing thick winter clothing sit
in a snowbank talking and making snowballs as if in an
assembly line GREG the freckle-faced leader gathers the
snow loosely packs it and hands it to ERIC a short but
stocky boy who packs the snow tighter and hands it to
MORGAN the fat and stupid kid who finishes the snowballs
off by putting a rock in the middle

GREG
Aw you don’t know what you’re
talking about

ERIC
No YOU don’t know what youre
talking about You’re totally

wrong

GREG
Look my dad could kick your dad’s
ass

ERIC

Dude my dad has a chainsaw He

bought it on Saturday and it’s THIS

BIG

Eric holds his small arms apart as wide as they will go

GREG
That’1ll do him a lot of good when
my dad uses his forty-four

The fat kid tries to join the debate

MORGAN
My dad has a machete’

GREG and ERIC
Shut up Morgan

GREG

My dad has a- HEY Here he comes

The boys quickly gather all their snowballs and stand up
each with about seven snowballs in their arms

From around the corner little Joe emerges He has stopped

singing and is now just swinging his wooden sword about and
shouting at nothing

JOE
Take THAT you BAD OLD FUZZIES And
THAT And THAT

GREG
(Calling out)
Hey Joe

Joe stops and looks up through his thick glasses at the
boys

GREG
You want us to huck these snow
balls at you

JOE
Sure okay

ERIC
Ask us NICE Handi-boy

JOE

Please throw snowballs at me

The boys launch snowballs at Joe Joe just lets the
snowballs hit him and smiles

ERIC
There you go you dumbass retard

JOE
Bacon cheese and gravy

One snowball hits Joe square in the head knocks his glasses

off and sends him to the ground The mean boys run over and
stand over Joe menacingly

MORGAN

GREG

‘Have you been fighting Blue Horned
Furries Freak-o -

JO

GREG

JOE

Greg angrily nails Joe with another snowball right between
the eyes Joe jumps up and starts to run away

GREG
Were not done with you yet freak

Get over here
hes

The boys chase after Joe As-Funs but tie laughing
insanely

JOE
They’re in hot pursuit

EXT MALA VISTA - TOWN SQUARE - DAY

A group of Mala Vista TOWNSPEOPLE are busy decorating the
charming little town square with more Christmas garnishes
Some people are putting up lights others are decorating a
large Christmas tree with ornaments Two TOWNSMEN are
putting up a banner that reads ‘Mala Vista’s 25th Annual
Christmas Pageant December 22-25°

With a legal pad and pen in her hands MS SCHWEINBERG walks
through the decorations She is a miserable miserable
miserable woman who is fat unattractive mean and oh so
miserable When she looks up at the banner a disgusted look
crosses her miserable face

MS SCHWEINBERG
THAT’S NOT WHERE THE BANNER GOES

The two men putting up the banner stop and look down at Ms
Schweinberg

MS SCHWEINBERG
The banner goes at the FRONT of the
road so tourists can see it when
they drive by How are any tourists
going to see it back there

MAN
But we ALWAYS put it back here

MS SCHWEINBERG
Well you didn’t ALWAYS have ME
around to tell you otherwise My
God how did you people manage all
these years without me

The men start taking the banner back down again Schweinberg
walks over to where two WOMEN are decorating the Christmas
tree

MS SCHWEINBERG
NO NO NO You put all the red
ornaments on the top That’1ll look
ridiculous

The two woman sigh Ms Schweinberg calms down and tries
another approach

MS SCHWEINBERG
Look I was designated to be in
charge of this years pageant
because of my many years of
experience in the Theater I know
that I’m new here but you have to
trust my ideas With me here this
Christmas pageant will be the most
refined classy and -

Panting and wheezing naked Joe comes bursting past Ms
Schweinberg yelling as he goes

JOE
BACON AND GRAPES

Joe runs circles around the Christmas tree flinging his

sword around in all directions Ms Schweinberg’s eyes pop
her face contorts with anger

MS SCHWEINBERG
You are NOT to run around and play
here young man Do I have to drag
you home to your mother AGAIN

JOE
I’m a goat named April BAAAAA

2
Joe starts slamming his head into a lamp-pole like a goat

JOE
A-A-April BA-A-A-A

The townspeople all look at Joe and shake their heads Some
sigh some roll their eyes but all seem to have seen Joe do

this on many occasions Ms Schweinberg turns to another
RESIDENT WOMAN

MS SCHWEINBERG
Honestly I don’t know WHY his
mother lets himrun around like
this

WOMAN
Well his mother hasn’t been well

MS - SCHWEINBERG
I can see why

JOE
I’LL GET THEM DUKE BOYS

Joe whinnies once more like a goat and charges the Christmas
tree headfirst

WOMAN
Look out

The tree falls with a loud CRASH The tree ornaments smash
against the ground The townspeople all look in shock at
their once beautiful now befallen piece of art

JOE “4S
roud of himself) me
Ai-Y

A lone ornament spins on the ground at Schweinberg’s
feet Joe quickly runs over and stomps’it dead

MS SCHWEINBERG
WHY YOU LITTLE- THAT DOES IT

Ms Schweinberg grabs Joe by the arm and angrily leads him
away

MS SCHWEINBERG
Were going to see your mother

JOE
MOMMY YEA

As he’s being dragged away Joe turns around and yells at
the Christmas tree he’s just defeated

JOE

wooden house Immediately”Schweinberg starts banging on the
door

No answer Joe picks his nose and pulls out a booger He
smiles and proudly shows it to Ms Schweinberg

JOE

Schweinberg gives a disgusted look then knocks harder On

her final knock the door swings open on its own
Schweinberg peeks her head in

MS SCHWEINBERG

disrupting the town again

JOE

Ms Schweinberg pulls Joe inside the house

MS SCHWEINBERG

JOE
(To his finger)

INT JOE’S HOUSE

Ms Schweinberg leads Joe through the kitchen looking for
his mother

MS SCHWEINBERG
Ms Mitchell This is really
becoming a problem-

Ms Schweinberg looks down at the floor -- what she sees
makes her gasp She puts one hand to her mouth

MS SCHWEINBERG
Ms Mitchell

Ms Schweinberg leans down the camera TILTS down with her
to reveal a womans body lying motionless on the floor

MS SCHWEINBERG
Oh my Goodness

JOE
What’chya doing on the floor mom

EXT JOE’S HOUSE - (SPECIAL EFFECT) - DUSK

The camera LIFTS from the small mountain home up over the
trees past the highest peaks and quickly makes its way
down the mountains through the foothills and settles on a’

large thriving city A TITLE reads ‘Denver - that very
night’

EXT CITY STREET - LOWER DOWNTOWN - DENVER - NIGHT

This is the happening part of town Several clubs line the
street There is some snow on the ground but not near as
much as there was up in Mala Vista

There is a small bar on the corner with some activity

INT SMALL STAGE - NIGHT

The face of DAVE GOODMAN a handsome 26 year old slacker
fills the frame He lifts a microphone to his mouth and
begins to sing poorly

DAVE
(Singing)
I want to be forrrrr-ever young I
want to be FORevvvver young

PULL BACK to reveal that Dave is in a Karaoke bar singing
the crappy hit song ‘Forever Young’ along with words that
are printed on a screen Daves twenty-something friends

KURT LYNN and ANN are sitting at a nearby table drinking
and shouting

KURT
STOP YOURE KILLING US
Lynn and Ann laugh

DAVE
Just let me stayyyyy This
special way Forever YOUNGGG

The song ends Dave takes a bow and a few BAR PATRONS
applaud

DAVE
Thank you ladies and gentlemen

Dave goes back to his table and joins his friends He grabs
a yard of beer and chugs half of it quickly
KURT
Dude Dave that was some
horrendous singing there

DAVE
Why thank you Kurt

The voice of the drunken female KJ (Karaoke Jockie)
blares over the microphone

KJ

(Drunk)
Okay that was Dave singing ‘Forever
Young’ Don’t we ALL want to be

Dave and Kurt cheer Ann and Lynn roll their eyes

KJ
Now let’s get KURT up here to do
‘Sister Christian’

DAVE
(jumping up)
Dude I gotta check my messages and
see if I have any work tomorrow

Dave and Kurt get up together but Kurt heads for the tiny
stage and Dave heads for the phone

BACK OF THE BAR - CONTINUOUS

At the pay phone Dave plugs up one ear with his finger to
muffle out the HORRIBLE SINGING emerging from Kurt in the
background and dials in a ridiculous amount of numbers

EXT DENVER - ESTABLISHING - MORNING

The Denver skyline looms majestically in front of the snowy

Rocky Mountains The sun is rising telling us that
has passed

INT DENVER HOSPITAL - MORNING

A sad shot of little Joe sitting motionless in the

a day

waiting

room He is holding a small wooden box as if it were his
most prized possession Nearby a young sweet NURSE and an
odd lady by the name of SOCIAL WORKER PAM are having a quiet

conversation

NURSE
I don’t know what to do with him I

think he’s too slow to understand
whats happened

SOCIAL WORKER PAM
Well we have to try and explain it
to him as delicately as possible
Just try to get on his level

The Nurse walks over to Joe and kneels down with a big

smile

NURSE
Hello there young man What have
you got there

Joe looks down at his little wooden box

JOE
My Poofies
NURSE
Oh can I see
Joe holds the box away
JOE
Nobody touches my poofies
NURSE
Okay I won’t touch your poofies

JOE
I have to get back to Mala Vista
and fight the Blue Horned Fuzzies

NURSE
Oh Uh are those you’ re
imaginary friends

JOE
Fuck no Id NEVER befriend a
fuzzy
The nurse looks to Social Worker Pam for help but Social
Worker Pam just shrugs and smiles

NURSE
Well why don’t you tell me about
them Are they Oh Are they
bears

JOE
-’ Fuzzies are smarter than bears

NURSE
Oh Fuzzies are smart huh

JOE
Except for Buckie

NURSE
Buckie

-t

JOE
The one with the two BIG front
teeth He looks like this-

Joe sticks his two front teeth out like a beaver

JOE
He’s the dumb one But he’s the one
you gotta keep your eye on

NURSE
You have such a neat imagination
Joe And that’s very special

JOE
I’m a goat named April BAAAA

Joe smacks his head against the wall HARD Some plaster
falls off Joe cringes his eyebrows and looks around

JOE
Where’s my mommy

The nurse takes in a DEEP breath and puts her hand on Joe’s
shoulder

NURSE
Joe Your mommy is in a very
special place She’s looking over

us right now
The nurse looks up to heaven with a smile Joe looks up too
JOE
Shes upstairs

NURSE
No no She’s further away than
that Somewhere she can rest for
a long time

JOE
She‘s in the bathroom

NURSE
No

The nurse bites her nail and then comes up with a better
one

3

NURSE
Shes in a place where it’s very
colorful and everybody is happy
and they sing and dance all the
time

JOE
Shes in Oklahoma

NURSE
No dammit she’s DEAD

The Nurse stops herself but it’s too late Social Worker
Pam almost screams

NURSE
Oh I’m sorry I’m sorry

Joe goes into a small fit Making loud goat noises and
banging his head repeatedly into the wall

JOE
BAAAAAAAAAA

The nurse sighs and walks back over to Social Worker Pam

SOCIAL WORKER PAM
Well that didn’t go very well

NURSE
Im sorry I just panicked

SOCIAL WORKER PAM
I don’t know what to do I can’t
locate any other family and the
father hasn’t called back

NURSE
This ‘father’ sounds like some kind
of deadbeat It just makes me sick
how some fathers can abandon their
- children

SOCIAL WORKER PAM
Don‘t worry he’ll show up I bet
his conscience is getting the
better of him RIGHT NOW

SMASH CUT TO
EXT LOVELAND SKI SLOPE - NEAR DENVER - DAY

Dave gives a loud happy ‘YAHOO’ as he skis through fresh
powder moguls Kurt is skiing next to him Loud THRASH MUSIC
plays as the two expert skiers race down the slope

Dave takes a jump does a flip in the air and lands
perfectly Kurt tries to do the same thing but misses the

landing and falls violently on his ass Dave laughs and skis
up to him

DAVE
Dude you okay

KURT
That was a hell of a move Dave

Dave helps Kurt up The two brush themselves off and then
stare out at the beautiful snow covered peaks

DAVE
I didn’t win the Oberwitz ski
challenge for nothing

KURT
Yeah too bad you lost the trophy
Kurt adjusts his bindings and then gets ready to go again
KURT
Alright ace let‘s go I swear I’m

gonna beat you down this mountain-

Kurt stops when he notices that Dave isn’t listening He’s

just staring off into the mountains with an extremely blank
face

KURT
Dave

Dave’s heavy in thought

KURT
Dave

DAVE
Huh (Snapping out)
iT

KURT
Woa dude you were on like planet
Zandor or something

DAVE

you you gotta party while you can

DAVE
Damn right

KURT
Did you talk to that Social Worker
that called you

DAVE
Nah I don’t want to deal with any
of that crap They probably just
want to give me counseling to deal
with her death or something

’ KURT
Dude aren’t you forgetting
something
DAVE
What
KURT

That MAYBE she left you some cool
stuff I mean she moved up into the
mountains and all maybe she left
some killer mountain home to you

DAVE
Oh come on I havent even talked

KURT

INT SOCIAL WORKERS OFFICE - DENVER HOSPITAL - DAY

Dave walks into a brightly lit office filled with happy
pictures and comfy furniture Social Worker Pam sits at her
desk with her hands folded

SOCIAL WORKER PAM
Hello Mr Goodman it’s SO nice of
you to FINALLY stop by I’m the
social worker in charge of your

case
DAVE
Hey
(Then Confused)

Social Worker Pam flips through some Papers

SOCIAL WORKER PAM
Now as you probably know Carrie
Mitchell has passed away due to
unforseen complications with
stomach cancer You were her
boyfriend I understand

This sort of makes Dave laugh

DAVE
Well a LONG time ago yes

Social Worker Pam flips through some papers Dave tries to
peer over to them to see if there are any great prizes he’s

inherited Pam turns the papers over and gives Dave a dirty
look

SOCIAL WORKER PAM
Per her instructions in the will I
am supposed to turn over her
residence in Mala Vista to you

Daves eyes light up

DAVE
Really Woa Kurt was right

SOCIAL WORKER PAM
You are also to take immediate
- custody of Joe
Dave is still smiling - but he seems a bit perplexed
DAVE
Joe What’s Joe Is that like her
dog or something

Now the Social Worker is really pissed off

SOCIAL WORKER PAM
MR GOODMAN YOU HAVE GOT A LOT OF

DAVE
(Absolutely freaking out)’
Woa woa woa - Woa- woa

Dave tries to catch a breath

DAVE
Look lady Carrie Mitchell got
Pregnant when we were dating but
she didn’t keep it

SOCIAL WORKER PAM
Are you actually trying to tell me
that you had NO IDEA this child
existed

DAVE
It CAN’T be mine - There’s been
some kind of mistake

The Social Worker takes a deep breath and shuffles her
papers

SOCIAL WORKER PAM
Maybe youd better start from the
beginning Mr Goodman

Dave sits back down

DAVE
We were only seventeen In high
school Wed only been going out

DAVE

mess that poor kid up so bad He
would be way better off if we could
find a REAL family to adopt him

Why I thought there were huge
waiting lists of people who wanted
to adopt

SOCIAL WORKER PAM

Dave watches with dumbfounded fascination as his son does
some silly makeshift martial arts moves Suddenly a cold
wind makes Dave shiver Dave looks over and sees that a

window has completely blown in - a small pile of snow lies

on the carpeting below it Joe also notices the broken
window and gasps-

JOE
Fuzzies I better get going

Joe gets up and dashes off to his room

DAVE
What Get going where

But Joe doesn’t answer Dave sighs and tries to cover up the
broken window so that more cold air can’t get in He takes
the wooden coffee table off the floor and leans it up
against the’ window

DAVE
I need a hammer
calling to Joe)
Do you know the neighbors across
the street Joe

With incredible energy Joe jumps out of his room wearing
wooden armor and a metal pot on his head and nothing else

JOE
Du-du DAAAA Fuzzy fighting Time

Joe shakes his little body in a bizarre dance
DAVE
Oh boy

MS SCHWEINBERG
Nothing Charley here has been a
resident for-
Joe bursts onto the scene looking like Pippi Longstockings
and ranting as usual
JOE
THERE’S SHUFFLEBOARD ON THE ALOHA

When Joe sees the men from the paper he starts to yodel
horribly while dancing a bizarre little dance

2

PRESS PERSON

JOE

JOE
If Fuzzies could have it their way

upside-down from trees Right

MS SCHWEINBERG
Okay Joe that’s enough-

JOE
If Fuzzies could have it their way

shoulders and twist your heads off

and dance again The Press People are visibly disturbed

MS SCHWEINBERG

INT JOE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Joe walks into his house and sets down his sword Dave is
pouring himself a Guinness The house is already a mess

runs towards Joe apparently hungry Joe bends down to pet
the cat

JOE
DUCK Quack quack

DAVE
(Horrified)

JOE
Blue Horned Fuzzies

Dave walks over to Joe and kneels down He tries to pull out
the rubber bands
JOE
EEEEEOOWWW
Dave gets the rubber bands out and tosses them on the floor

DAVE
There

Joe smiles up at Dave Dave just looks around with a ‘what
do we do now’ look on his face

Joe responds with a sigh and a ‘I don’t know YOURE
supposed to think of something’ look Dave bites his lip
Joe makes a small goat noise The two just stand there
ridiculously for a LONG period of time with nothing to say
Finally Dave tries to break the ice

DAVE

So

Joe puckers his lips
JOE

-- So
DAVE

Uh How was your day

JOE

DAVE

JOE
Good

Another long uncomfortable pause

DAVE
Uhh Whats new

JOE

A final long uncomfortable pause

DAVE
Howre ya feeling

JOE
Good

DAVE
Good

(Giving up)

Lets see what’s on TV

JOE

GRAPES
INT LIVING ROOM - JOE’S HOUSE
Dave and Joe sit on a couch watching some horrible sitcom
and eating potato chips They are both entranced Suddenly
Joe’s stomach growls

JOE
What’s for dinner

Dave looks puzzled

DAVE
Dinner Oh You want dinner
JOE
I want beef and gravy And carrots
and peas
Dave looks worried
DAVE
Uh I can’t make anything I

always eat Taco Bell or KFC

JOE
What’s that

Dave looks out the window and realizes that there are no
fast food restraunts within miles of Mala Vista

DAVE
Oh BOY are we in trouble

Suddenly a loud horrible MOAN bellows through the house
The house rocks and creaks hauntingly Then there is a loud

SNAP and the power cuts out then comes back on - Followed
by another MOAN - Or was it a growl

DAVE
What was that

Dave jumps up and looks out the window Joe stands next to
him looking out at the fresh fallen snow But there is
nothing to see Joe squats down below the window

JOE
You better get down Dave
DAVE
What
JOE

You better get down Dave

DAVE
Why

CRASH The window explodes open Glass and snow blow in
violently and Dave quickly takes cover on the floor The
HOWL of the blizzard echoes through the house

DAVE
HOLY SHIT

Snow begins to pile up on the floor Dave protects himself
then realizes his error and tries to protect Joe as more
snow swirls around the living room like a small tornado

As quickly as it started the blizzard stops -- the moaning
wind TRAILS OFF leaving Dave and Joe in extreme silence
Dave looks around as sees that the only real damage is the
broken window and a heap of snow on the floor

DAVE
Wow

Joe stands up and sticks his head out the broken window

JOE
WERE NOT SCARED OF YOU FUZZIES

2

Dave looks at Joe incredulous Suddenly a KNOCKING at the
door makes Dave jump again Dave nervously goes to the door

but opens it only to find Ms Schweinberg in her scowling
misery

DAVE
Oh hello

MS SCHWEINBERG
My name is MS Schweinberg I need
to talk to you about your son Joe

Daves eyes light up he’s thirking perhaps he finally has a
taker

DAVE
Yeah

MS SCHWEINBERG
Mr Goodman I have five children
Five nice NORMAL children 1
spent a lot of pain and a lot of
money to make sure they’re well
educated and well mannered I even
moved up here in the mountains to
get them away from all the bad
stuff in the city

DAVE
That sounds good

Dave waits for Schweinberg to ask if she can adopt Joe

MS SCHWEINBERG
To be frank Mr Goodman I don’t
like the thought of a crazy child
near my normal children I try to
keep them away from him but it’s
very hard in a small town like
this

Daves smile drops
DAVE

Oh So you don’t WANT him
then

MS SCHWEINBERG
Want who Joe Of course I don’t
want him

DAVE
Oh Crap

Just then

Joe

MS SCHWEINBERG
That child is dangerous to himself
and to my little ones I thought
that when his mother passed
on that it would be the end
but then you showed up and the
problem is still here

DAVE
Yeah well I didn’t exactly have a
choice

MS SCHWEINBERG
Mr Goodman your child belongs in
a home for mentally challenged
kids The only homes like that are
down in Denver

DAVE
You mean an institution I don’t
think I could do that

MS SCHWEINBERG
Sure you can They could take
better care of him there

DAVE
Look Joe’s a little strange but he
doesn’t need to be put in a padded
cell

runs by carrying his little wooden box
JOE

MY POOFIES MY POOFIES HOORAY FOR
MY POOFIES

Joe prances away Dave clicks his tongue

MS SCHWEINBERG
You know why he’s so strange don’t
you

DAVE
Yeah I know When he was four he
tripped down a flight of stairs and
smashed his head through a TV set
that was playing ‘Dukes of Hazard’

MS SCHWEINBERG
Where did you hear that nonsense

DAVE
(gesturing to Vance and
Pap’s house)
From those old dudes over there

MS SCHWEINBERG
Those old geezers are almost as
crazy as your son

DAVE
Then it’s not true

MS SCHWEINBERG
NO
(Pause)
It was Knight Rider That show with
the talking car THAT’s what was
on

DAVE
Oh

MS SCHWEINBERG
Look kid I can assure you that
I‘m NOT the only person in Mala
Vista who feels this way To be
honest the whole community is
distraught about him

DAVE
Believe me I wish I could help
you but-

MS SCHWEINBERG
You know he killed his mother

DAVE
What

MS SCHWEINBERG
Yes I’m afraid it’s what’s bound
to happen when a child like that is
allowed to run free He’s alittle
monster and he has to be stopped
before-

DAVE
I think you better leave now

MS SCHWEINBERG
(Yelling)
Mr Goodman I moved up here for
some peace and quiet-

Dave walks into his house and slams the door Ms
Schweinberg fumes with anger

Everyone is seated in fold-up chairs and eating snacks Ms

Schweinberg is at the head of her living room standing
behind a card table

MS SCHWEINBERG
Well I think most of you are aware
as to what this meeting is about

The townspeople nod comically in unison

MS SCHWEINBERG
Our lives have ALL been made
extremely difficult with this
insane child running around and I
think we’re fed up

A few MURMURS run through the crowd Everyone seems to
agree Finally a TOWNSPERSON stands up -

He keeps running naked through my
backyard with that wooden sword

Another TOWNSPERSON stands
TOWNSPERSON 2
He’s still swimming in my septic
tank on Sundays

MR MORGAN
He knocks over everything
pretending to fight those blue
thingies

MS SCHWEINBERG
Well Im glad you all agree with
me because Sheriff Pinkerton is
here FINALLY to listen to our
woes Sherrif

A very unenthusiastic SHERIFF PINKERTON stands up and
immediately has to hold his hands up to hush the plethora of
random SHOUTS and COMPLAINTS that emerge from the
Townspeople The Sheriff is an Overweight man who never has
to deal with much more than hunting violations

SHERIFF PINKERTON
Now now people I know the
Mitchell boy is a problem Lord
knows I’‘VE had to deal with him
SEVERAL times over the years
ever since he put his head through
that television set that was
Playing ‘The Love Boat’

The townspeople look at each other confused

MR MORGAN
No no Sheriff It was ‘Fantasy

PAP

Naw it was ‘Dukes of Hazard’

The townspeople ERUPT into argument about which show it was
AD LIBBING names

MS SCHWEINBERG
It was Knight Rider

VANCE

Finally Sheriff Pinkerton puts his hands up to quiet the
crowd

EXT RECEPTION ROOM - SECONDS LATER

Dave walks out of the Social Worker Pam’s office and into
the reception room

Cc

ay

He lays his head against the door and breathes deeply to try
and forget the images he just saw

A small IMAGE of Ms Schweinberg appears repeating the
words she said to Dave before

MS SCHWEINBERG
The child belongs in an

institution Nobody else can take
care of him the right way

The image FADES AWAY and Dave is left to ponder

FADE OUT

INT JOE’S HOUSE - MALA VISTA - LATER THAT DAY

Dave is sitting on the couch solemnly watching the alpine
ski finals on television and drinking a twelve pack of beer
that he picked up in Denver Dave sighs and pouts as the
racers on TV have fun in the snow

Suddenly A loud THUMP sounds from outside Dave looks

around but then just eats some potato chips and goes back
to his show

DAVE
(To the Television)
Look out for the ice dumbass

Another loud THUMP this time causing the house to shake

ever so slightly Dave gets up and walks curiously to the
front door i

EXT HOUSE - DAY

Outside Dave looks around to see where the thump came from
He sees nothing

Suddenly Joe appears in the background He is sliding down
a monkey slide A rope from the top of a tall tree down to

the side of the house with bicycle handle bars to hold
onto

Joe SLAMS into the side of the house with a dull but loud
THUMP then falls violently to the ground

Dave spins around in time to see Joe dizzily pick himself up
off the ground shake the stars out of his head and then
climb back up to the top of the slide

co
fhe

Dave watches as Joe gets to the top of the tree puts the
bicycle bars on the rope slides down and smashes again into
the’ side of the house with another loud THUMP and again
falls to the ground this time with a painful moan

Joe gets up to repeat the process yet again but Dave grabs
him

DAVE
Woa woa doesn’t that hurt

Joe thinks a moment

JOE
Only the end part

Dave surveys the monkey slide

DAVE
You know if you put that end up
higher and gave it some more slack
you wouldn’t crash into the house

Joe just looks confused

DAVE
C’mon I’1l show you

FADE TO

EXT ROOFTOP - JOE’S HOUSE

Dave hammers the end of the rope up on the roof Joe is at
his side handing him nails

FADE TO

EXT TREE - JOE’S HOUSE

Now Dave is up in the tall tree with Joe Joe helps as Dave
unwraps the rope form the tree then wraps-it again with
more slack For the first time Dave appears to be having
some fun

DAVE

See Now THAT’S a monkey slide
JOE

CHEESE AND BACON
DAVE

Give her a try

Ov
w

Joe puts the handle bars on the rope Some EXCITED MUSIC
begins as Joe steps off from the tree AND - -

-- Smashes into the house just as hard if not harder than
before and falls FURTHER to the ground with a huge crash
Daves smile drops Joe picks himself up shakes his head
and tries not to pass out Dave looks concerned

DAVE
OH SHIT ARE YOU OKAY

JOE
Yeah
(Smiling)
Yeah That’s WAY better

Dave laughs Joe throws the handle bars up to him

JOE
You try now Dave Bacon

Dave catches the handle bars and looks at them with a boyish
grin Should I

With a small giggle Dave sets the handle bars on the rope
and slides down with a fun ery And -- smashes into the side

of the house and falls to the ground with a horrible thud
Joe laughs

DAVE
Wow

Dave gets up off the ground and limps back towards the tree

JOE
Peas and carrots

DAVE
Bacon and Cheese

Dave and Joe run back to the tree for another ride

EXT VANCE AND PAP’S PORCH - DAY

Vance and Pap watch expressionless as Dave and Joe
repeatedly smash their bodies into the side of their house
and yell out food names

VANCE
Boy you’d almost think they were
related

PAP
Aw to hell with you §
EXT JOES HOUSE - DAY

Joe is lying on the ground Dave crashes into the house and
falls next to him They both laugh

JOE
Good one Uncle Dave

Dave stops laughing and looks closely at Joe’s face For a
moment he is entranced Dave seems to suddenly be filled
with wonder Perhaps wonder that this little person he is
looking at is his son

Joe looks at the snow around him and starts to play with it
Dave smiles and just watches his son for a moment As Joe

starts eating the snow Dave seems to want to say something
Finally

DAVE
Joe

JOE

(Mouth full of snow)

Mph

DAVE
I’m not your Uncle

JOE
Mph

DAVE
I’m your

Dave takes another gulp of air and tries again
DAVE
Well you see when I was
seventeen

But Dave realizes there is no way he can explain himself He
slumps back with all the magic of the moment gone

DAVE
I’m just a loser that’s all

JOE
Oh-oh It’s almost four thirty

Joe jumps up and heads into the house Dave sighs deeply

Suddenly the three mean boys jump into frame

GREG
Hey look It’s Retardo Montalban
JOE

JOE
Right

Apparently for the first time Eric notices the box hanging
from Joes shoulder

ERIC

JOE

Greg snaps his gum and glances at Eric

MORGAN
Are those like Twinkies or

GREG

Joe wraps his arms around the box

JOE

Joe quickly starts to walk away Greg Eric and Morgan are
shocked at Joe’s insolence

GREG
Hey

Joe walks faster The boys run up to him Now Joe runs but ©
the three boys are already on him Eric trips him and Joe

falls to the ground Greg jumps on top of Joe and wrestles
the wooden box free

JOE
No

Greg stands up with the box in his hands and examines it He
tries to open it but it won’t open

ERIC
How do you open this stupid thing

Joe jumps up and tries to grab the box but Greg holds it up
high over his head - out of Joe’s reach Joe again tries to
jump for it but Greg throws it to Bric

Now Eric examines the box and Joe runs to him

ERIC
Whats inside

JOE
PLEASE gimme my Poofies
Finally Eric gives up and throws the box on the ground Joe
makes a dash for it but Greg grabs him from behind and
keeps him from grabbing the box

GREG
We gotta bust it open

MORGAN
Yeah

Eric grabs a large tree branch and holds it up over his
head about to break the box apart

JOE
NO

GREG
Thats right freak-o wWe’s gonna
break your Poofies

The boys break out in laughter Eric brings the branch down-
But Joe breaks free To Gregs amazement Joe spins around

does a sloppy but still impressive back flip and kicks Greg

in the mouth Greg flies to the ground with a hard thud

Eric stares in absolute shock as Joe jumps HIGH in the air
and lands in front of him

JOE
BACON AND CHEESE

ERIC

AAAGH

Joe does a little spinning kick and sends Eric reeling
backwards Before Eric can hit the ground however Joe
punches him in the chest and chops him in the jaw Eric
finally falls with a brutal crunch

Now its Morgan’s turn Morgan is absolutely terrified

MORGAN
H-Hey Take it easy retard - I
mean - Joe

Joe lunges at Morgan Morgan tries to dodge but Joe is
incredibly quick He sweeps Morgan’s back leg and doubles
back to kick him in the back of the head

Morgan yelps and runs away as fast as his fat little body
will carry him

Joe brings his arms up in his best impersonation of Jackie
Chan

JOE
Cheese and grapes and ham an
grapes

Greg ominously gets up and wipes some blood from his nose
He charges at Joe’s back -

-but Joe sees him coming and does a quick spinning back kick
into Greg’s balls Greg gropes at the air and slowly falls
to his knees Greg holds himself up off the ground with his
arm and looks up at Joe

JOE
Don’t Touch My POOFIES

Joe sweeps Greg’s arm and Greg crashes to the ground The

nothing happened

Poor kid
SOCIAL WORKER PAM
(Sarcastically)

Joe clings to the side of the car vance looks too see if
anybody is watching him and then gives Joe a little kick to
force him in the car

SOCIAL WORKER PAM
You still don’t get it

Dave looks confused

SOCIAL WORKER PAM
Knowing where your child is and
cooking meals and all that isn’t
what makes somebody a good parent
It’s something else

DAVE
Yeah well whatever it is I sure

SOCIAL WORKER PAM
Tt‘s too bad you think that way

Social Worker Pam walks over to her car and gets in the

driver’s seat The Nurse from earlier sits in the Passenger

The townspeople look at each other

(Under her breath)
Goooooococed riddance

MR MORGAN

quiet in this town

The townspeople concur and then start to walk away The

As Dave drives hurriedly down the mountain he rolls a
cigarette Dave looks out at a sign that he’s passing

INT DAVE’S CRAPPY TRUCK
Dave rolls his eyes and lights his cigarette

DAVE
Man What a week

Dave tries to forget everything by snapping on the radio
But the SONG that plays is ‘Like Father Like Son’

DAVE
Oh brother-

Dave flips the dial to another station -- which is playing
‘Cat’s In The Cradle’ Dave rolls his eyes

DAVE
Gimme a break

Dave searches through all the stations but EVERY SINGLE
STATION is playing a song which has to do with abandonment
andor Father-Son love Dave can’t believe it Finally Dave
stops on a station playing an UPBEAT SONG in which the
lyrics go - ‘You had a son but you abandoned him and now
his mother’s dead and youre abandoning him again - you’re a
shmuck yeah yeah yeah’

DAVE
Woa

INT SOCIAL WORKER PAM’S CAR - SAME TIME

the sun sets in the background The camera PANS over to the
forest area where Joe used to go to fight

FADE TO
EXT FOREST CLEARING - AFTERNOON

The area where Joe used to fight is quiet and still
A few small snowflakes drift down from the sky

Suddenly a large fur covered foot emerges from the trees
It holds there Then an entire furry leg emerges Camera
BOOMS UP to reveal a huge eight foot tall fuzzy creature
with two very large front teeth It has big round eyes and
two bluish Elk-like horns

The creature looks around Cautiously It appears fearful
that something might come kick its ass at any moment (a
little retarded boy for instance) But it slowly starts to
realize that there is nothing in the woods but it It takes
a step further towards the town then another step
Gaining confidence as it goes

winter fog blows over the town

INT MS SCHWEINBERG’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Ms Schweinberg sits in her big fat chair eating Crunch and
Munch and watching sitcoms Her miserable face is lit only
by the bluish light coming from the television The VOICES
from the television sound like ‘Seinfeld’

SEINFELD

would I stick a cat up my butt

The laugh track LAUGHS Ms Schweinberg laughs

SEINFELD
Why would I do it That could be a
CATastrophe

The laugh track LAUGHS Ms Schweinberg laughs

The laugh track LAUGHS Ms Schweinberg laughs But
Suddenly there is a very loud and jolting BOOM
MS Schweinberg looks around Was it a small earthquake

Greg appears from his room His arm is ina cast his eye is
still black and blue but he looks okay

GREG
What was that ma

MS SCHWEINBERG
You get back to bed It wasn’t
anything

But again the jolt rocks the house Now Greg looks extremely
nervous It seems someone is KNOCKING HEAVILY at the door
Frightened but annoyed Ms Schweinberg gets up and walks to
the door The heavy POUNDING continues

MS SCHWEINBERG
Just a minute Im coming I’m
come-

In mid knock Ms Schweinberg opens the door What she sees

causes all the blood to run out of her face and her jaw to
drop open

Greg tries to see past his frozen mother

GREG
(Scared)
Who is it ma

Ms Schweinberg stares at the thing on her doorstep We
don’t see it but we hear a strange low PURRINGCLICKING
sound Ms -Schweinberg stares blankly as her mind races to
comprehend She is in deep shock

On the doorstep dark in shadow is the eight foot tall fat
furry creature with shining eyes and a HUGE mouth Its two
front teeth are very large Its pupils dilate and the
creature stretches its smile even wider across it’s sinister
face making it look somewhat like a gigantic Cheshire Cat
Schweinberg tries to calm herself She swallows hard and
brings her head up to look unconvincingly powerful She
tries to be her normal bitchy self

So

MS SCHWEINBERG
Well What do YOU wanr-

KWWWWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA triririys Suddenly the
large gray creature breathes in and with a horrible cry
blows air and snow through the house knocking over
everything like a mighty typhoon blizzard As the
incredible amount of air rushes out the beast’s mouth it
actually appears to be having a good time
KWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Ms Schweinberg snaps out of her bitchiness and screams
loudly Greg screams along with her His scream her scream
and the roar of the creature race through the night air as
the creature’s amazing breath blows snow in all directions

with an eerie blue light Social Worker Pam looks around
confused about where this is lighting change is coming from

JOE
When PEOPLE moved up in mountains

BACON and GRAPES But instead of
going away Fuzzies Stayed and
watched and waited

The other children start to grow frightened Their eyes are
wide their mouths open Social Worker Pam realizes that Joe
is scaring the hell out of the other kids

SOCIAL WORKER PAM
oKay Joe I think that’s enough

JOE
They hibernate all summer long
building up their strength so they
can make the winters terrible for
people They blow the air with
their big fuzzy mouths And make
the snow crash into windows

The kids are petrified One LITTLE BOY wets his pants

SOCIAL WORKER PAM

The lights g6 off and lightning strikes The kids all SCREAM
with horror and run into each other and into the walls

Just as quickly the lights come back on The children are
all scared absolutely shitless

Several Mala Vista townsfolk including vance Pap and
Sheriff Pinkerton trot down the snow covered street in
their pajamas

VANCE
What’s goin’ on Sheriff

SHERIFF PINKERTON
Hell if I know

A loud CRASHING sounds through the hills

VANCE
Sounds like it’s coming from Ms
Schweinberg’s house

The people all run quickly towards the Schweinberg
residence

INT MS SCHWEINBERG’S HOUSE - NIGHT

CLOSE UP on Ms Schweinberg’s hand which is holding a
doorknob and shaking violently

PULL BACK to reveal that the door knob isn’t attached to
anything The door has been blown down along with most of
the windows of the house Ms Schweinberg is in shock
standing with the doorknob in her trembling hand and her
hair blown back ridiculously The creature is gone Sheriff
Pinkerton and the rest of the townsfolk run up to Ms
Schweinberg looking around in amazement at the devastation

SHERIFF PINKERTON

A loud ROAR bellows nearby Everybody turns towards the
horrible sound extremely frightened

INT DAVE’S CRAPPY APARTMENT - DENVER - NIGHT

A dark room There is CLICK CLACK of a door being unlocked
The door swings open and the lights are turned on revealing
Dave’s crappy Denver apartment It looks just like youd
think it would Clothes strewn about ski posters
everywhere Dave appears to be a bit intoxicated at this
late hour He throws a big brown box from the Mala Vista

house on the floor and plops down on a bean bag chair next
to it

Dave sighs and belches then fumbles at his answering
machine until it goes off BEEP

MACHINE

Dave Goodman I STRONGLY suggest

that you call American Express in

regards to your delinquent-
Dave grabs the answering machine tears it out from the wall
and throws it out his fourth story window CRASH Dave
looks over at the brown cardboard box He opens it and
takes out a picture

ANGLE - PICTURE

It’s of Joe when he was a couple years younger He is with
his mother Carrie who sits happily ona park swing while
Joe tries to eat the wood

INT DAVE’S CRAPPY APARTMENT - RESUME

Dave smiles at the picture and has a quick flashback-

EXT JOE’S HOUSE - DAY - FLASHBACK

The residents try the dance move again

A large pickup drives up Mr Morgan

of the truck

MS SCHWEINBERG
Do you people even know which way

Vance and Pap get out

They are all three wearing camouflaged
hunting gear and carrying large rifles

MS SCHWEINBERG
Did you find it yet

VANCE
Naw we ain’t seen it Did you say

MS SCHWEINBERG

VANCE

Maybe you scared the bear away Ms

Schweinberg god knows you scare
the hell out of me

MS SCHWEINBERG
How DARE you

WHAM A huge jolting sound causes everybody to look on

stage where the same lar

ge fuzzy creature has just dropped

down It raises its huge head and grins while making its
terrifying purrclick sounds

A few townspeople SCREAM others just stand wide-eyed in

disbelief

Ms Schweinberg nervously backs in to the Sheriff

MS SCHWEINBERG
(Terrified)
Th-that’s it

SHERIFF PINKERTON
(In shock)

Weirdest looking bear I ever saw

MS SCHWEINBERG
Don’t just stand there Shoot it

Vance Sheriff Pinkerton and Morgan raise their guns and
fire But the Fuzzy creature is INCREDIBLY fast - it jumps
out of the bullets way like an amazingly agile cat

VANCE
Holy crow you see that bastard
jump

The Fuzzy creature jumps back down and approaches the
townspeople stalkingly

MR MORGAN
Well there’s only one of it and
ten of us - let’s surround it

But just then two other Fuzzy creatures jump next to the
first one They are equally big but a little different in
shading They also don’t have the same two buck teeth that
the first one has The three fuzzies let out a horrible
moan that sounds like the end of the world

MS SCHWEINBERG
(Knowing what’s coming)
Oh no

Like a tornado the snow all around picks up and blows

through the town square The townspeople run screaming in
all directions

Within seconds the quaint town square is obliterated

INT CHILDREN’S MENTAL HOUSE - JOE’S ROOM - DENVER - DAY

Social Worker Pam is helping Joe unpack his belongings from

large cardboard boxes Joe is frantically going through the

Joe looks at the Social Worker like she’s insane
JOE

pulling at the locked door
JOE

THAT’S BETTER ‘CAUSE IT’S
CORN-NUTTIER

SOCIAL WORKER PAM
I didn’t think so

EXT MALA VISTA - TOWN SQUARE - AFTERNOON

The center of Mala Vista looks like a war zone An OLD war
zone since the heaps of snow and broken glass make it
appear as if nobody has lived in Mala Vista for years

Greg Eric and

Morgan still a bit bruised from their run in

with Joe days ago sadly sit in the snow looking out over
their wrecked town

GREG
Man This sucks We can’t even
play anywhere

ERIC

My dad says he’s thinking about
moving away to the city or
something

MORGAN
My dad says we’re gonna move away
to California

GREG
I don’t want to move This is so
lame I like it here

ERIC
If only we could fight like Joe we
could just take ‘em out like-

Greg jumps up with a start

GREG
Oh my God

os

ERIC
What

GREG

That’s it -- Joe What did Joe
always say he was going off to
fight Blue horned furries

MORGAN
Fuzzies

GREG
I could SWEAR the thing I saw the
other night had blue horns

ERIC
Right And it showed up right after
Joe left

GREG
Gentlemen We have got to get Joe
back

EXT TOWN SQUARE - JUST A FEW YARDS OFF - CONTINUOUS

The townspeople all stare at their wrecked town with heavy
hearts

VANCE
What do you think Sheriff

SHERIFF PINKERTON
I think these bears are slowly but
systematically goingto destroy our
town

MS SCHWEINBERG
Well thanks for the news bulletin
Ted Koppel What are you gonna DO
about it

The townspeople break out into AD LIB SHOUTS
MR -MORGAN
Yeah We need to call the FBI and
the CIA and the YMCA and the-
VANCE
Dammit Morgan YMCA ain’t gonna do
nothing

In the background though it must be VERY clear to see --
Greg Eric and Morgan hop into the back of a commercial
truck which then revs up and heads down the road Of
course nobody in the town sees any of this

SHERIFF PINKERTON
Oh sure we could get help maybe
they’d even bring a swat team Be
all over the papers and even in
nation wide television But when
all was said and done you think
wed EVER see our tourists up for
the Christmas Festival

The townsfolk think Even Ms Schweinberg can’t argue with
that
PAP
HEY YOU DUMB SONS A BITCHES

Everybody turns around and looks at Pap who is sitting on

his porch in the distance playing checkers with himself as
usual

PAP
They ain’t bears They’re Blue
Horned Fuzzies
Silence Finally Ms Schweinberg lets out a cynical

laugh

MS SCHWEINBERG
Would somebody PLEASE take him out
to pasture

Sheriff Pinkerton and Vance exchange glances It appears

they both have thought about these things being Joe’s blue
horned Fuzzies before

Everyone starts to move but come to an abrupt halt when
they hear a familiar sound AWOOOOC000000000000

The wind pitks up and some snow starts to slowly blow
around

MR MORGAN
Uh-oh

WOMAN
Look

Not one not three but TEN tall furry creatures emerge from
a dense fog of snow

2

VANCE
Holy crow there’s a whole flock of
‘em

The ten creatures are walking on all fours but quickly
stand on their hind legs and let out a new but equally
horrific cry At the sound of this yet another fuzzy this
one gray and even bigger than any of the others jumps into
the middle of the group

It appears that the gray is the leader It looks to the
fuzzy with the buck teeth and grins Buckie grins back

The fuzzies all charge the townspeople who are frozen in
panic The large Gray takes a YOUNG MALE TOWNSPERSON in its
immense claws and examines its body The townsperson just
kicks and writhes and screams in terror

The Gray jumps incredibly to the top of the highest tree and
hangs the poor man upside-down from the branches

Now the townspeople are REALLY scared as a couple more
fuzzies follow suit with the Gray by scooping up two other
townspeople - and putting them up in the tall trees as well

Everybody scatters and tries to take cover as the Fuzzies
all breath in deeply -- and then let out their immense

breath in all directions causing an absolute MONSTER of a
blizzard

A Ford pickup gets picked up in the incredible winds and
tossed into a heap of snow like a toy Sheriff Pinkerton
takes cover behind the truck where Vance is already
ducking As the raging storm continues Sheriff tries to
talk to Vance

SHERIFF PINKERTON
YOU KNOW SOMETHING VANCE

Excited Dave runs upstairs but Joe dashes to his room

INT JOE’S ROOM - DUSK

Rockyish music begins as Joe pulls the little wooden
breastplate over his chest He ties the strings securely
Joe puts on his helmet and takes the wooden sword in his
hand He holds the sword up over his head and looks
majestic

JOE

marches onward He passes a large tree where a TOWNSPERSON
is hanging helplessly upside down

ANGLE - TREE

The guy hanging upside notices Joe and suddenly his eyes
light up

TOWNSPERSON

EXT VANCE’S PORCH - DUSK

Pap watches as Dave bursts from his house and heads down the
road after Joe wearing all his ridiculous ski apparel

DAVE

PAP

related

EXT TOWN CENTER - DUSK

In the town square twelve of the large furry monsters are
busy tearing up the town

Three Fuzzies are eating plaster off the walls of a blown
down building

Two others are blowing snow through the few remaining
windows

Buckie is having fun jumping up and down on the destroyed
stage and the large Gray is holding three townspeople at
bay pinned up against a store front A few residents are
hanging upside-down from trees one of whom is Ms

Schweinberg
It’s a regular Fuzzy party

JOE
Hello there Fuzzies Having a good
time are we

All action comes to an abrupt halt The Fuzzies stop what
theyre doing and look over to see little Joe standing
proudly in his battle gear

The fuzzies all look absolutely petrified

JOE
You’ve been VERY BAD FUZZIES And
I‘d say youre all in a HEAP a
trouble

Two of the smaller fuzzies dash off into the trees scared
for their lives But the big gray turns its look of terror

into one of anger and then lets out a ery With that three
of the larger Fuzzies charge Joe

EXT MALA VISTA HOME - DUSK

Dave walks by the same house from the very first scene The
woman is peering out her door

DAVE

Dave pulls down his ski mask to show his face

DAVE
It’s Dave Goodman have you seen my
son
WOMAN
Who’s your son
DAVE
JOE JOE IS MY SON Have you seen

WOMAN

Ohh Yes he’s fighting the blue
horned fuzzies

DAVE
(Sarcastically)
Oh gee thanks a lot

Dave rolls his eyes and walks on

DAVE
Jesus this whole TOWN’S gone nuts

EXT TOWN CENTER - DUSK

The first fuzzy comes at Joe but Joe stands where he is
Just before the creature reaches him Joe ducks under it

then stands up and buries his wooden sword into the fuzzy’s
leg

The beast howls with pain The two other fuzzies approach
Joe but Joe sidesteps and knocks both of them to the ground
with sequential blows to the bottox Joe looks like an
expert fencer and martial artist as he systematically puts
the fuzzies to the ground The townspeople watch on in awe

It seems that Joe will have no trouble with the fuzzies but

just then the large Gray holds up his head and lets out a
terrible cry

Within seconds the ground starts to shake

EXT MALA VISTA - DUSK

Dave is still wandering around looking for his son when he
hears several very strange HOWLS in the far off distance

DAVE
(To himself)
What the hell is that

Dave cocks his head back and heads toward the odd noises
and feels a rumbling in the ground

EXT MALA VISTA - DAY
Greg and Eric stand behind Joe who looks a bit concerned

GREG
Oh my God

ANGLE - WOODS

From the nearby trees an absolute HORDE of Blue Horned
Fuzzies stream into the town

Theres at least fifty of them maybe more
TOWN SQUARE - RESUME

The blue horned Fuzzies line up behind the gray leader

ERIC
Look at all of ‘em

JOE
Bacon and grapes We’ve got a big

problem

The Fuzzies menacingly approach Joe and the boys It appears’
that all is lost

When suddenly a loud collective SHOUT is heard Joe turns
around to see - All the children from the mental Ward
running up over the hill Triumphant MUSIC swells up as they
charge like a refined army and line up behind Joe

The Fuzzies are scared once again

JOE
BEEF AND GRAVY

CHILDREN
BEEF AND GRAVY

Joe charges at the Fuzzies with the army of handicapped
children faithfully behind him The two forces meet - a
Clashing of children and Fuzzies Townspeople watch in awe
as Joe brilliantly leads the attack Joe himself takes out
four fuzzies with whacks to the knees

ANGLE - VANCE SHERIFF PINKERTON AND MR MORGAN
Who are watching the incredible battle from nearby

SHERIFF PINKERTON

Suddenly a car pulls up and Social Worker Pam steps out

SOCIAL WORKER PAM
What the hell is going on here
Why did you bring these children-

A fuzzy runs through frame chased by a child Social worker
Pam drops her jaw then looks behind her to see the Fuzzies
all being chased away by the children

2
Social Worker Pam is absolutely in shock

SOCIAL WORKER PAM
Oh boy I’m going to have to
rethink my perception of reality
again

A fuzzy runs right in front of Pam with a small boy on its
back

SOCIAL WORKER PAM
Okay So monsters are real
Okay That’s fine

Joe nails Buckie in the knees with his wooden sword Buckie

howls and runs back up into the woods along with the rest of
his kind

JOE

Joe stops and catches his breath Satisfied he puts his
little sword back in its sleeve and smiles as old spaghetti
western music kicks in

JOE

The townspeople rejoice They converge on Joe immediately

and start patting him on the back ruffling his hair and AD
LIBBING compliments

the odd looking ski man from the photo stands before him
Joes eyes grow wide

like long lost family Dave pulls the mask down and Joe sees
that it is Dave underneath

distance The other townspeople hug both Dave an Joe Dave
