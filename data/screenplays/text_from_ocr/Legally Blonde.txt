INT DELTA GAMMA HOUSE - DAY

HEAD OVER HEELS by the Go-Gos plays as we wind through a
flock of abstract silky golden strands -- PULLING BACK to
discover that the strands are hair on a BLONDE GIRLs head
But not just any blonde girl a girl in Delta Gamma the
blondest most beautiful sorority at USC

We PULL BACK further to see that shes signing a handmade
card She holds it up OVER HER SHOULDER we see hearts
and glitter surrounding and Good Luck Tonight and Elle
and Warner forever

She carries the card out of her room and we FOLLOW HER across
the hall into the room of --

THREE BLONDE CHEERLEADERS who stop practicing their pom-pom
routine to sign the card As they finish we follow the Card
Girl out and into the room of --

A BLONDE GIRL IN A TANK TOP and shorts working out ona
Stairmaster as General Hospital plays on a tiny TV She
signs the card while continuing to exercise We move on to
the room of--

A BLONDE GIRL MAKING OUT WITH HER BOYFRIEND who stops long
enough to sign the card as her boyfriend nibbles on her
neck She hands the card back and we head into the room of --

A BLONDE PARTY GIRL who pours a pink frozen margarita into a
glass from the blender then passes it down to ANOTHER BLONDE
GIRL assembly-line style The card goes one way being
signed as the drinks go the other

Once the card arrives back in the Card Girls hands we
follow her out of the room and down the hall until she
reaches the very last and biggest door --

She puts a kiss mark on the card then kneels down and slides
the card under the door

INT ELLES DELTA GAMMA ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

The CARD slides into the pink room hitting the feet of
UNDERDOG a tiny chihuahua who picks it up in his mouth
and trots it over to a pair of perfectly pedicured feet in
strappy sandals

An equally perfectly manicured hand with a Sisters Forever
charm bracelet dangling from the wrist scoops up Underdog

As he rises we RISE WITH HIM passing toned waxed tanned
legs in pink Prada pedal pushers and a pair of perky boobs
encased in a spaghetti-strap top -- until we finally reveal a
magnificent head of long blonde hair and a sweet beautiful
face This is ELLE WOODS 21 the Goddess Queen of Delta
Gamma She talks on a pink fuzzy phone

ELLE

(into the phone)
I love you too
Behind her a Go USC banner is pinned to the pink wall A
stack of Cosmopolitans and Glamours teeters on the
dresser The closet overflows with trendy designer clothes
in a predominance of pink

ELLE (CONTD)

(continuing into phone)
Ill see you tonight
She hangs up and lets out a squeal of joy kissing Underdogs
head and taking the card out of his mouth She reads it
touched

ELLE (CONTD)

(continuing)
Elle and Warner forever Aww
Underdog yips

MARGOT

ELLE (0S)

ELLE a vision of fluffy blondeness runs down the stairs
toward Serena and Margot holding the card

ELLE (CONTD)

But I m not positive its gonna happen
tonight --

SERENA

Helloohe just had lunch with his
grandmother You know he got The Rock

MARGOT

The three girls jump up and down squealing and hugging
ELLE

As they head toward the door Elle spots AMY a shy girl ina
Delta Gamma Pledge sweatshirt standing alone
ELLE (CONTD)

ELLE

(teasing)

INT SUNSET PLAZA BOUTIQUE - DAY

Serena and Margot watch as Elle stands in front of a mirror
trying on a Herve Leger white mini-dress Sexy and ultra-
tight

ELLE

Too demure

MARGOT

I think you should go with red Its the
color of confidence

ELLE

Well I dont want to look like I know
whats coming

SERENA

I dont understand why youre completely
disregarding your signature color
She holds up a tiny pink slipdress

ELLE

Hes proposing I cant look like I

would on any date This is the date The
night Ill always remember I want to
look special Bridal but not like I
suspect anything

ACROSS THE STORE

A SALESWOMAN looks at her cohort

SALESWOMAN
(sotto)
There s nothing I love more than a dumb
blonde with daddys plastic

She grabs a dress off the Clearance Sale rack ripping off
the HALF PRICE TAG

ON ELLE AND THE GIRLS

SERENA
I cant wait to see you wearing The Rock

Elle looks at them suddenly concerned

ELLE
Wh at if -- you know -- its not the
night
MARGOT

Why else would he be taking you to The
Ivy Youve been dating for a year --
its not like hes trying to impress you

SERENA

Elle youve heard the man pass gas in
his sleep That practically means youre
pre-engaged
on
The Saleswoman approaches with the dress kiss-assy smile on
her face

SALESWOMAN
Did you see this one We just got it in
yesterday
Elle fingers the dress then the new price tag looking back
at the saleswoman excited
ELLE
Is this a low-viscosity rayon
SALESWOMAN
Uh yes -- of course
ELLE
With half-loop top-stitching on the hem

SALESWOMAN

(smiling a lie)
Absolutely Its one of a kind

CO NT I NUED (2 )

“ Elle hands the dress back to her no longer pretending to be

excited

ELLE

Its impossible to use a half-loop
topstitch on low-viscosity rayon It
would snag the fabric And you didnt
just get this in because I remember it
from the June Vogue a year ago so if
youre trying to sell it to me at full
price you picked the wrong girl

The saleswoman slinks off embarrassed

MARGOT

(to the saleswoman)
Nice try

Elle shakes her head and turns back to the girls as she slips

on her Manolo Blahnik sandals doing one last mirror check
smoothing down her golden mane

ELLE

How can it be the right thing if were

WARNER

I have to think about my future And what
people expect from me

ELLE

So youre breaking up with me because

youre afraid your family wont like me
(through her tears)

Everybody likes me

WARNER

East coast people are different
ELLE

Just because I m not a Vanderbilt all of

Vanderb ilt --

WARNER

that enough He looks away

WARNER

I m sorry
She gets out of the car and drags herself up the stairs to

Professor Stromwell is in front of the class
PROFESSOR STROMWELL

So youve filed a claim Now what
She looks over to see Elle sitting there typing on her
laptop

PROFESSOR STROMWELL (CONTD)

(continuing)
Ms Woods

ELLE

Dont you also need to have evidence

PROFESSOR STROMWELL

Meaning
Everyone now stares at Elle

ELLE

Meaning you need -- reasonable belief
that your claim would have like
evidentiary support

Stromwell is somewhat impressed but doesnt show it

PROFESSOR STROMWELL

And what kind of evidentiary support does

this case require Lets ask Mr

Harriman who clearly believes that I

might be hungry
She looks up at Arrogant Aaron in the back row Who
unknowingly has Eat Me written on his forehead He looks

back at her confused as the students around him snicker

EXT BEAUTY OASIS - NIGHT

A Closed sign is on the door

THROUGH THE WINDOW we see Elle and Paulette sitting in the
empty salon laughing and clinking cans of Pabst Blue Ribbon
as they toast Elles small victory We PULL BACK leaving
them laughing as the MONTAGE ENDS

INT CRIMINAL LAW CLASS - DAY

THE STATE V LATIMER is written on the board A pony-
tailed less made-up Elle takes notes on her lap-top as
Warner makes an argument

WARNER

According to Swinney v Neubert Swinney
who was also a private sperm donor was
allowed visitation rights as long as he
came to terms with the hours set forth by
the parents So if were sticking to
past precedent Mr Latimer wasnt

st al ki ng -- he was clearly within his
rights to ask for visitation

PROFESSOR DONQVAN

But Swinney was a one-time sperm donor
and in our case the defendant was a
habitual sperm donor who also happens to
be harassing the parents in his quest for
visitation

73
WARNER
But without this mans sperm --the
child in question would not exist
He grins and looks around as the class murmurs their
agreement
PROFESSOR DONOVAN
Now youre thinking like a lawyer
EMMETT enters from the back holding a file He stands
there
quietly watching
Elle tentatively raises her hand
PROFESSOR DONOVAN (CONTD)
Ms Woods
Sarah looks at Claire
SARAH
(sotto)
The idiot speaks
ELLE
Although Mr Huntington makes an
excellent point I have to wonder if the
defendant kept a thorough record of each
sperm emission made throughout his life
The class titters Elle grows annoyed

PROFESSOR DONOVAN

(bemused)
Why do you ask

Elles hesitancy is replaced by conviction
ELLE

Well unless the defendant attempted to
contact every single one-night- stand to
determine if a child resulted in those
unions -- then he has no parental claim
whatsoever over this child Why this

s perm Why now

Emmetts mouth twitches into a smile

73 ELLE (CONTD)
(continuing)
For that matter all masturbatory
emissions where his sperm was clearly not

seeking an egg could be termed reckless
abandonment

Warners mouth hangs open As does Sarahs and the rest of
the class Donovan smiles

PROFESSOR DONOVAN
I believe youve just won your case

Elle grins
74 INT DONOVANS CLASS - LATER

As the students file out Elle passes Donovan

Youre going to trust the word of a woman
who named her child after a condiment
Shes ly-ing

EMMETT
And you know this for a fact

ELLE

Did you see the icky black color of her
hair

EMMETT
So
ELLE

I never trust a woman whos not blonde
Except for my friend Serena but thats
only because shes a blonde at heart
Thats the whole reason I m starting the
Blonde Legal Defense Fund

He looks at her and laughs

EMMETT

The what

ELLE

Blondes are discriminated against
worldwide Brookes a blonde and people
are saying shes sleeping with the cheesy
pool boy and shooting her husband If

she was a mousy brunette it would be
Oh the poor widow

EMMETT

Youre serious
Shes fired up now

ELLE

You should see the way I m treated in
class Im a complete source of mockery
This is why the Blonde Legal Defense Fund
is needed

He goes along with it won over by her enthusiasm

EMMETT
Okay how would it work

99 E LLE

It would be a full-service law firm by
and for blondes providing positive
blonde role models and community outreach
in high blonde areas I mean think

about it -- name one blonde intellectual
role model

EMMETT

-- I cant
ELLE

That is a direct result of anti- blonde

discrimination
EMMETT

Wait -- Hilary Clinton
ELLE

If she were a true blonde she wouldve

left the cheating bastard Blondes dont

let their husbands get fellated by

brunettes and live to tell about it
Emmett frowns

EMMETT
In that case maybe Heyworth got ---
fellated --by a brunette and Brooke
caught him

ELLE

Exactly how much gorilla sex do you think
a sixty-year-old man can take

EMMETT

Thats not really a topic that keeps me
up at night -- but maybe it should
Elle digs in her purse

ELLE
Speaking of that --- I bought you some
seaweed cream while we were at the spa

JUDGE
Ms Woods begin your questioning

9182000 Revision (Pink)

ELLE

First your Honor I d like to point out

that not only is there no proof in this

case but theres a complete lack of mens

rea which by definition tells us that

there is no crime without a vicious will
The DA rolls her eyes as do the lawyers present

JUDGE

I am aware of the meaning of mens rea
What I am unaware of is why youre giving
me a vocabulary lesson instead of
questioning your witness

Flustered Elle turns to Chutney

ELLE

Okay -- Ms Windham when you uh arrived
back at the house Was your father there

CHUTNEY

Not that I saw But like I said I went
straight upstairs to take a shower

ELLE
And when you came downstairs what happened

CHUTNEY

I saw Brooke standing over his body
drenched in his blood

ELLE
But Mrs Windham didnt have a gun
CHUTNEY

No shed stashed it by then
Brooke rolls her eyes

EMMETT

Honor Speculation

that she was in the shower
People start to murmur Donovan snickers Sarah looks

I have a point I promise
JUDGE
Then make it

Elle looks at Chutney

ELLE

Chutney why is it that Tracy Marcinkos
curls were ruined when she got hosed
down

CHUTNEY

Because they got wet

ELLE

Thats right Because isnt the first
cardinal rule of perm maintenance that
you are forbidden to wet your hair for at
least twenty-four hours after getting a
perm at the risk of de-activating the
ammonium thiglycolate

giving
Chutney pales

CHUTNEY
Yes --
Elle continues
ELLE
And wouldnt someone whos had -- thirty
perms -- throughout her lifetime be

well aware of this rule

Chutney doesnt answer She just glares at Brooke

ELLE (CONTD)

(continuing)
And if you in fact

were not washing
your hair

as I suspect you were not
since your curls are still intact

wouldnt you have heard the gunshot

Chutney continues to glare

ELLE (CONTD)

(continuing)

And if you in fact heard the gunshot
then Brooke Windham wouldnt have had
time to hide the gun before you got
downstairs Which would mean that you
wouldve had to have found Mrs Windham
with a gun in her hand to make your story
sound plausible Isnt that right
CHUTNEY
Shes younger than I am Did she tell
you that How would you feel if your
father married someone younger than you
ELLE
You however had time to hide the gun
didnt you Chutney After you shot your
father

Brooke looks at Chutney in horror realizing

CHUTNEY
I didnt mean to shoot him --

(to Brooke)
