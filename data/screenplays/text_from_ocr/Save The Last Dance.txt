explanatory The theme

The Judges exchange a look New MUSIC CUES UP Some
driving CLASSICAL NUMBER Sara tries to elevate her
body above the music but shes nervous unsure on her
feet She keeps glancing in the back of the auditorium
for Glynn Searching for her port in the storm
Wondering where her mother is and knowing how badly shes

faces This is a near out-of-body experience for her
She walks like a well-rehearsed soldier in a stiff
straight line to the schools entrance Its clogged
with students Inside the doorway two security guards
flank a metal detector When its Saras turn to pass
through one of the guards grabs her backpack and
wordlessly begins searching it He hands it back to her
on the other side of the detector where Sara stands
obtusely and mutely amazed

INT HALLWAY - MORNING

Clutching new textbooks Sara starts down the hallway
Shes hoping nothing in her face reveals the rising panic
in her heart Shes surrounded Alone Every inch of

her feels afraid

SARAS POV

as she MOVES FORWARD A crush of KIDS -- mostly black
with a sprinkling of white and Latino faces thrown in
Kids like her Only they dont dress like her They
dress like commercials for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin
Klein And they definitely dont sound like her

on other conversations Its not just the words Its
how they say them Loud Matter-of-fact Cool A

cooler cool Like they breathe static electricity

Thats it The entire student body is energized Saras
thoughts are jolted by two black girls squeezing by One
clips Saras elbow as she passes knocking it against a
locker They keep going as if they dont see her No

one seems to see her Welcome to mass avoidance at
Patterson High

AT SARAS LOCKER - LATER

Saras back is to a black girl striding purposefully

Shes eager to make a friend One friend But
Chenilles gone

ANOTHER CORRIDOR

Sara memorizes the schedule of classes in her hand She
passes a clutch of students who surround a kid in the
middle like a horseshoe Sara gets a fleeting glimpse of
him

SARAS POV - PATRICK REYNOLDS

Eye candy Tall Dark Heartbreakingly handsome If
Patterson were a monarchy Patrick would be king He
sure holds court like one turning on his dazzling smile
and abundant charm for the crowd One gets the sense
that the All-American Home Boy is almost as enraptured
with himself as the sycophants around him

INT JURASINSKIS CLASSROOM - MORNING

Everyone looks at her The way kids look at new kids

SARA
Its a non-fiction novel The

A small murmur goes up Over this the voice of a
dissenter

PATRICK (0S)
White folks back then felt safe
Capote scared em He took hard
core crime out the ghetto and
dropped it in Americas back yard
Thats what makes the book
special

Sara cranes to see him God Its pretty-boy Hes

Scrubbing away whats churned up inside The dervish
ends in her room where she finishes unpacking

stares at the shoes until her eyes blur Then she
snatches them up and entombs them deep inside her closet

at one of several formulas (C2H602) on the blackboard
Sara just looks at him

MR HILL

at the blackboard She has no idea -- and no intention
of admitting it

PATRICK
(very casually)
Thats too big

She glints at him grits through her teeth

SARA
I know its too big

She puts the beaker down Picks up a vial Flips
through her textbook Her eyes shift from it to the
blackboard trying to make a connection She settles on
one Picks up a vial of powder Patrick grabs her hand
leans over and whispers

PATRICK
I wouldnt do that if I were you

SARA
(yanks her hand back)
Who died and made you teacher

Patrick pulls back looks at her He cant believe she
dissed him A small smile forms on his face Sara turns
away from it goes back to her vials Patrick slides to
the farthest end of the table Watches her consternation
with bemusement

PATRICK
Know the difference between ethyl
glycol and methyl acetate Both
got three elements two parts the
same Its that first part C2

versus C3 C3 could blow a vial
right out a persons hand

Sara thinks hes messing with her But then the contents
of the beaker begin to ominously bubble Panicked she
drops the vial into their sink It instantly goes up in
smoke Some of the liquid splashes on Saras lab coat
Patrick grabs a wet towel quickly wipes it off The
class stops cold Hill rushes up to them Once hes

sure Saras fine he looks sternly at Patrick

MR HILL
What happened Everybody back in
your seats
Patrick stares at Sara Her face is red Shes biting
her lip
PATRICK
I misread the component
MR HILL
(even more angry now)
You You misread a component
Dont give me that Patrick You

to say something but the words wont come out Hill
regards her wearily then walks off pushing the curious
class back to their stations Sara looks at Patrick

robustly singing the refrain to the song Theres a
party on the floor FAVOR Sara and Patrick facing each
other Hes moving already She starts to dance
stiffly tentatively Patrick smiles at her Shakes his

music

PATRICK
Now move your hips Not so fast

The musics beginning to feel good to Sara Patrick lets
go of her hands Starts to dance Sara watches him
intensely her body follows his stiffly Patricks a
good teacher He leads without leaving her Whenever

she misses a complicated move he smoothly segues into

another less-complicated one

80

Sara begins to pick-up on Patricks rhythm Her eyes
never wander from his And then she starts to feel
something else They both do A rising beat A
quickening heart And not from the dancing She smiles
bashfully at him Patrick suddenly grabs her around the
waist pulls her to him in a sexy spoon dance All Sara
can do is try to keep up and hang on

dazzled by what she sees which is --

PATRICK

pummeling his dealer into cowering submission Only then
does he look over at Malakai who eyes engorged with
rage is standing over his opponent kicking and stomping
him with no signs of letting up Patrick can see
Malakais too far gone for talk He rushes him from
behind nearly lifts Malakai off his feet to swing him
away from the dealers writhing body on the floor

Sits across from Sara and Patrick who have moved even
closer to each other Patricks arm is around Saras
shoulder He whispers something in Saras ear She
laughs and looks up to see the white woman staring at
them with a muted but obvious repugnance Watching the
woman from the corner of her eye Sara drapes her arms
around Patricks neck nuzzles at his ear Patricks
eyes widen Sara playing this for all its worth folds
one of her legs between his and whispers

SARA
We have an audience Work with

Stravinskys Scenes De Ballet as choreographed by
Christopher Wheeldon Theyre both enraptured But
while Patrick keeps sneaking excited glimpses of Sara
her eyes remain fixed on the dancers the dance She is
utterly totally engaged and amazed The yearning that
never really left her returns to tug at her heart and
project her soul onto the stage

121 EXT STREET (SOMEWHERE IN BALTIMORE) - NIGHT

Post-ballet Sara and Patrick walk Shes quiet
introspective Patricks at a loss He cant decipher
her mood and which is more hes disappointed by it

PATRICK
I thought you would like it

SARA
I did

PATRICK
You aint actin like you did

She looks over at him tries to smile

SARA
Im sorry
They come to a small secluded bridge Sara sits down on
the edge of it Patrick follows suit A long moment
SARA

I dont want you to think I didnt
have a good time tonight Patrick
I did But ballet isnt a part of
my life anymore

PATRICK
Why not What happened You just
woke up one day and decided to
waste your talent

SARA
(without rancor)
How do you know I have talent
Because I did some stupid leg
trick

PATRICK
I saw the look on your face when
you did it Sara The same look I
saw tonight Goofy happy So if
youre gonna tell me somethin
about not dancing at least tell
me somethin real

A long difficult moment wherein Sara attempts to find
the words face the pain that comes with them Finally
she looks at him

SARA
Maybe I dont want it to be real

She stares out at the water the moon reflected off of
it Its hard to reconcile that beauty and the turmoil
shes feeling But she goes on

SARA
What I want is to wake up and see
my mom For things to go back to
the way they were When they made
sense When my life made sense
(because)
And its all my fault She got
scraped off the highway for me
for my fucking audition She was
rushing It was raining It was
raining
(a torrent)
But she promised to be there
I made her promise And then I
didnt wait for her I should
have but they called my name and I
didnt say anything I just went
out and danced I was mad I
needed her and she wasnt there

She buries her face in her hands breaking down racked
with tears and guilt Patrick puts his arms around her

SARA
(inconsolable)
She was dying while I was dancing
and I was mad at her and Im
sorry Im sorry

PATRICK
Its not your fault it rained or
she died Or that you danced
Thats what you were there for
Your mom wouldve expected you to
do what you did
Sara choking on tears regards him forlornly

SARA
Thats what makes it so bad She
always did what was right for me
I wanted to be a prima ballerina
-- had to be Even if it took
most of our money all of her
spare time I didnt care It
was my stupid dream and it killed
her All she wanted was for it to
come true

121 121

PATRICK
You still got whatever you had
when your mom was alive Sara
She wouldnt want you to give up

Sara swipes at her face looks up at him still crying

SARA
I know but she I just dont
think I can do it without her

PATRICK
(holding her)
Do you want to do it Sara I
mean you Do you want Juilliard

SARA

SARA

A rhetorical question under the circumstances Patrick
regards her tenderly moves her hair from her eyes
Stares deeply into them Sara smiles wanly certain she
looks like shit But it doesnt matter The moment has
named itself And so with more certainty than passion
they kiss

freeway waiting to be seen The noise level is at a

peak when Chenille and Sara walk in Chenilles carrying
a fussy Christopher his diaper bag and her backpack
Sara wanting to be helpful reaches for Christopher

SARA
Want me to take him

Chenille shakes her head Walks to reception to sign
herself in Sara takes in the faces of girls younger

than herself the grime and gloom of the room Its
incomprehensible that this is a place where sick children
are brought to get well Chenille finishes at the desk
Returns to Sara They cross to a corner of the clinic
where they sit -- on the floor Chenille indicates the
receptionist bitterly

CHENILLE
That wench You gotta stand over

her to make sure she puts your
name on the damn list Triflin
bitch

starts to wail and flail Chenille cant placate him
One of his kicks connects with Chenilles open backpack
sends books and papers flying Sara can see the veins
stand up on Chenilles neck

SARA
Ill get em

She does Chenilles finally got control of Christopher
but hes still crying Chenille slips off his dirty
diaper When Sara hands her a clean one Chenille
regards her strangely as if just remembering that shes
there

Probably thinks its all Patricks

fault
SARA

No I explained about Nikki
CHENILLE

None of its on you

SARA
She started it Chenille She
wanted to start it I told you
what she said

Chenille flashes a look finishes up with Christopher
She picks him up puts a bottle in his mouth Cradles
him

CHENILLE
Maybe she didnt have no business
gettin in your face But she had
a reason to say what she said
A reason Sara studies her trying to fathom the remark

SARA
So you agree with her You think
I dont belong with Patrick

CHENILLE
What I think dont matter But
you and him act like it dont
bother people that youre
together Like it dont hurt
people to see

SARA

Snookies voice weakly creaks out Hes trying to rise
to the occasion

SNOOKIE

But Malakai and Patrick stay where they stand Too close
for comfort Both in the danger zone Malakai regards
Patrick with a combination of cruel anger and deep
genuine hurt

MALAKAT

PATRICK
Cause you wrong Malakai

MALAKAT
No You wrong You BEEN wrong
You aint worth shit no more
(venomously)
Get out my face and take that ho

Patrick bucks up Sara walks over to him gently
clutches his sleeve Its no easier to turn away from
Malakai than it is to walk away from a lifetime of
friendship But Patrick does With Sara holding onto
his arm at his side he turns and walks away

EXT STREET - SARA AND PATRICK - NIGHT

Sara looks at him Now shes getting mad

SARA
Youre never gonna run your own
life as long as you keep running
back to Malakai every time he
fucks up or fucks you over

Shes crossed the line But Patrick responds so
deliberately so calmly prosaic that she doesnt
immediately realize it

PATRICK
First of all Malakai aint never
fucked me over Second of all

dont know shit about none of it
So dont come off to me like you

Sara turns her back on him and Patrick walks away

between Patrick and Sara shes as smug and overbearing
as ever

TONI
Lovers quarrel Youre better

Sara stares at her uncomprehending at first She
resists the urge to slap the smile off Tonis face She
gets in it instead

SARA
Toni listen carefully Youre a
simple bitch and you dont have
any friends black or white
because nobody likes a fucking
asshole

She storms off leaving Toni for once speechless

parents who are clearly stricken Arvels father

stoic holds his wifes hand Arvels mother kneads a
Kleenex her face etched with tears Patrick hugs her
Stands up to see Malakai frozen in the doorway put off
by the palpable grief Patrick crosses over to him

They retreat quietly into the corridor their concern for
Arvel a shaky ground for conciliation

MALAKAT
Why his moms cryin like that
Arvels gonna make it right
That whats his nurse said She
told me herself Your friends

gonna make it Did that bitch
lie to me Talk to me Patrick
Is he gone

Patrick steers Malakai away from the waiting room backs
him against a wall and in a gentle but firm way holds
him there

PATRICK
They just got bad news man They
dont need to hear it again
(trying to be
strong faltering)
Arvels fightin’ Hes gonna pull
through Thing is when he does

they dont think he aint
shit Arvel aint gonna walk
again

In that moment whatevers left of Malakais soul
crumbles He looks at Patrick with aggrieved disbelief
and then a building anger A stronger man would probably
cry

Patrick eases his grip Malakai straightens his body
cocks his head slightly Studies Patrick in this
crooked derisive way

MALAKAT
I got a good reason now man
