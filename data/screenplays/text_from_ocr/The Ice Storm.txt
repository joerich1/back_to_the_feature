EXT TRAIN - DARKNESS BEFORE DAWN

Suburban Connecticut outside of New York City 1973 The
still after a terrible storm Trees dripping their branches
torn the air warming just before the break of a new day The
train lies dark and motionless a few flashing yellow
emergency lights up front as a work crew removes debris from
the track

INT TRAIN PRE-DAWN
Various passengers huddled uncomfortably cold asleep

On Paul Hood 15-and-a-half stoner-preppie look hunched up
in his seat under the faint emergency exit light He reads
his Fantastic Four comic book by the pale light of the
emergency exit sign

Suddenly the lights begin to flicker on and the hum of the
trains engines returns

The conductor enters the car blasting forth in his classic
nasal voice

CONDUCTOR
Good morning ladies and gentlemen --

He sounds like a baseball announcer

PASSENGERS
(mumbling ad lib)
What ladies

CONDUCTOR
-- this train originating at New
Yorks Grand Central Station is
back in service - next stop will be
New Canaan Connecticut New
Canaan Connecticut next stop

He moves on to the next car
The train begins to move

Paul rubs his elbow against the window and looks out into the
still-dark early morning

He looks back down at his comic book
On the comic book Reed Richards (also known as Stretch) has
zapped his young son with a cosmic ray gun to neutralize the
destructive energy that Annihilus has implanted in him

The Thing Medusa Flame and Richards wife Sue Storm look
on stunned
â€œTHEN YOUVE TURNED HIM INTO A

VEGETABLE YOUR OWN SON DONT
YOU SEE SUE HE WAS TOO
POWERFUL IF HIS ENERGY HAD

TO BUILD HE WOULD HAVE
DESTROYED THE WORLD

Paul looks up again thinking

PAUL (VO)
In issue number 141 of The
Fantastic Four published in
November 1973 Reed Richards has to
use his anti-matter weapon on his
own son who Annihilus has turned
into a human atom bomb His son is
the result of Richards coupling
with the earthling Sue Storm and
the problem is that the cosmic rays
that infused Richards and the rest
of the Fantastic Four on their
aborted moon mission have made
young Franklin a volatile mixture
of matter and anti-matter

EXT TRAIN BRIDGE PRE-DAWN

The train moves slowly through a suburban semi-forested
landscape

PAUL (VO)
And thats what it is to come from
a family if you analyze it
closely Each of them is negative
matter for the other ones And
thats what dying is -- dying is
when your family which is in fact
your personal negative matter from
which you emerge -- its when the
family takes you back thus hurling
you back into negative space

INT TRAIN CONTD

On Paul as the sun breaks over the horizon His face glows
warmly in the yellow light He looks down idly at the comic
book

PAUL (VO)
So its a paradox -- the closer
youre drawn back in the further
into the void youre thrown
EXT CONRAIL STATION EARLY MORNING
The train slowly pulls in

The train doors open and Paul weary from the long night
emerges He sees his family gathered at the other end of the
platform -- Ben 40 a bit worse for wear but still retaining
traces of his boyish looks Elena 37 distant and elegant
even in her oversized sweater and Wendy 14 a sullen
suburban Lolita

He pauses regarding them

They stand silent even dignified awaiting him
EXT ST PETERS SCHOOL MORNING

To establish A typical New England prep school
INT PAUL AND FRANCISS DORM ROOM MORNING

Cramped a mess but quaint Paul shares the room with
Francis Davenport IV a dissolute smart-ass son of money

Pauls alarm clock rings He slams his hand down on it and
jumps out of bed fully clothed in his rumpled preppie
uniform of frayed khakis loose tie shirt with one tail
untucked in etc Across the room Francis beckons from his
desk as he finishes loading up a four-foot-high bong

FRANCIS
Arise and shine young Hood

PAUL
I hope you changed the water in
that bong from last night

FRANCIS
(finishing a hit)
The water as you call it is a
special mixture of amaretto and
BenandBen blended for just the exact
chemical interaction with the last
of our precious Thai stick

Paul reluctantly walks over and takes a hit He coughs
spewing uninhaled smoke

FRANCIS (CONTD)
Waste not Master Hood -- that was
20 for the bag

PAUL
(gathering books papers
almost talking to
himself)
Man Francis you are one drug
addled elitist freak and when the
revolution comes I do not want to
be lined up with you and shot
cause youre fucking ripe for
political reeducation you know
like in the fields

FRANCIS
Paul cancel your mental
appointments baby What are you
like still stoned from last night

PAUL
(spraying some chloroform
mouth spray)
I gotta get to English class

INT ST PETERS CLASSROOM DAY
An English class in progress

Paul Hood sits blankly hardly listening until he hears the
teacher call out

TEACHER
Libbets

LIBBETS
What Dostoyevsky is saying here is
that to be a Christian is to
choose because you have to choose
of your own choice but since you
cant choose to be good because
that would be too rational you have
to choose to be bad -- its
existential

TEACHER
Thank you Libbets thats a very
compelling summary but --

Paul looks at her smitten Marge Pauls friend notices his
look

INT ST PETERS HALLWAY DAY
As class lets out Paul accosts Libbets
PAUL
Um Libbets Hey Dostoyevsky Im
also really a fan and what you
were saying you know have you

ever read The Idiot

LIBBETS
The Idiot

PAUL
If you liked Notes from
Underground youll love The Idiot

LIBBETS
(turning to go)
Great thanks for the tip

PAUL
(after her)
The Idiot

INT ST PETERS HALLWAY DAY
Paul walks with Marge

PAUL
Im in love with Libbets Casey

MARGE
Yeah well youve been in love
with like every other girl here I
was wondering when youd get around
to Libbets

PAUL
Its beyond mere physical
attraction

MARGE
Thats good because I dont think
Libbets is capable of the sex act

PAUL
Truly Do speak

MARGE
My diagnosis is messed in the head
A poor little rich girl -- I mean

check out the jeans and fur look
And lend your ears to this
brutality Like her mom and step
dad and her step-sisters are going
to Switzerland to ski over
Thanksgiving break -- and like they
didnt invite her

PAUL
How do you know this shit

MARGE
They did it last year too Its
like traditional or something
Theyve got this humongoid Park Ave
apartment and she just holes up

INT

Paul

there with a wad of cash
(beat)
Arent the hugely wealthy sad

PAUL
(pause)
You think Francis is going to beat
me to the punch here

MARGE
Since he sleeps with every girl you
ever show an interest in why dont
you just keep your Libbets thing a
secret from him

PAUL
Good thinking Marge

SCHOOL PARTY NIGHT

Francis and friends enter the dark crowded room

Various kids are awkwardly dancing to some progressive fm
style undanceable rock (Jethro Tull etc) Francis hands Paul
the tail end of a joint but Paul waves it away

PAUL
No more man Im about to drop as
it is

FRANCIS
See ya

PAUL

Where you going

FRANCIS
Paul let me enlighten you about
something
You and I exist on two opposite
sides of a great existential
divide that being your pathetic
virginity on the one hand and my
astonishing number of sexual
conquests on the other Im off to
get laid See you

PAUL
Flame on asshole

FRANCIS
And remember with your erogenous
zones lubricated as such with the
mighty herb do not attempt
terrestrial contact with members of
the opposite sex -- because you
drone on like a motherfucker when
youre stoned
He waves his fingers toward Pauls eyes in the classic
stoned gesture then wanders off

Paul looks on at the gathering Marge waves to him from the
dance floor

LATER
INT SCHOOL PARTY CONTD

Paul wanders stoned through the party He sees Libbets from
across the room She seems to be surrounded by friends

INT PARTY CONTD

Paul has cornered Libbets and is talking over the music
There are just a few people left most of them making out
with each other

PAUL

(stoned)
-- because Ive been reading
Kerouac and Ginsberg and those guys
were creating beat culture and
traveling and sleeping wherever
and of course with all kinds of
people but when you read carefully
the various contemporary accounts
of their lives and uh these guys
didnt bathe much I mean they were
really filthy with like genital
crabs lice exceptionally strong
body odor

Libbets smiles through her yawn
EXT SCHOOL BENCH NIGHT

Paul sits alone on the bench freezing cold eating a donut
Some kids from across the lawn yell good-night to him

INT DORM ROOM EVENING

Paul is at his desk Francis enters wrapped in a towel
fresh from the shower

PAUL
How can you do that man

FRANCIS
Do what

PAUL
Sleep all day I mean look its
already getting dark outside and
youre just getting up
FRANCIS
(beat)
Um Libbets Casey

PAUL
What

FRANCIS
Aha I could sense the vibe

PAUL
What do you mean

FRANCIS
Am I right or am I right

PAUL
Shit Youre not planning --

FRANCIS

My man I speak to you solely as a
comrade in arms offering
unconditional aid Ive been giving
this one a lot of thought and I
believe that the two of you
together might just reach that
higher ground that --

A knock at the door

STUDENT (OS)
Hood telephone

Paul rolls off his bed opens the door

PAUL
Dont mess with Libbets I mean it

INT DORM HALLWAY NIGHT
Paul walks to the pay phone at the end of the hall

PAUL
Hello

INTERCUT - HOOD HOUSEHOLD NIGHT

Its a modern (shag carpet geometric-patterned wallpaper
etc) suburban house

Ben Hood talks on the phone a drink in his hand

BEN
Paul

In the background we can see Wendy watching Richard Nixon

on
TV

PAUL
Hi dad

BEN
Hey guy Things ok up there You
all right

PAUL

Im fine dad

BEN
Well good Just confirming Youll
be on the 350 Wednesday afternoon

PAUL
Well dad actually I thought Id
take the morning train on

Thanksgiving -- got a lot of
studying papers you know lab
experiments --

BEN

Lab experiments Right smart guy --
Paul you know your mothers gonna
be disappointed not to see more of
you -- In fact let me make this
more than a simple request guy I
think you should

IN THE BACKGROUND

NIXON

(on TV from San Clemente

press conference)
Well with regard to the questions
as to why Americans feel we were
wrong to make the tapes that is
not particularly surprising I
think that most Americans do not
like the idea of taping
conversations and frankly it is
not something that particularly
appeals to me

BEN
Hold on for a second
(turning)
Wendy you want-to say hi to your
brother

She frowns

BEN (CONTD)
Come on
She gets up sullenly and goes to the phone

WENDY
Charles

PAUL
Charles Have you been keeping out
of my shit Have you refrained from
entering the sacred precincts of my
room

WENDY
I have not touched your sh--
(looks at father)
Stuff You watching this

PAUL
Watching what

WENDY
Nixon doofus Its incredible He
should be shot

BEN
(overhearing)
Hey thats the president of the
goddam United States youre talking
about Wendy

From the kitchen Elena overhears Shes dressed to go out
but in the process of making a Kraft macaroni and cheese
dinner for Wendy

WENDY

Hes a liar

(still talking more to her

father than into the

phone)
Dean told him on March 21st about
Kalmback and Hunt all about the
payoffs to the Watergate burglars
so you tell me where the so-called
Dean Report is but you cant
because it doesnt exist because
he lied about Haldeman and
Erlichman and the April 17 tape
thats why Liar

Ben retreats going to the wet bar to pour another drink

BEN
(muttering)
OK OK the defense rests
(to Elena in the kitchen)
Want another

ELENA (0S)
No thank you We should be off

BEN
Gotcha

He puts the bottle back down without pouring
INTERCUT BACK TO PAUL

PAUL
(on the phone)
Hey Charles Charles calm down --
I wasnt in on it

Elena putting on her coat comes into the den and gives
Wendy a kiss on the forehead as Wendy mumbles her good-byes
to Paul on the phone

ELENA
Dinners on the counter Well be
at the Williamss -- you know the
number
(takes the phone from
Wendy)

Paul Hi Is there anything youll
want any particular kind of food
or snack or anything we can stock
up on Youre all right OK
See you next week I love you

Back to Nixon on the TV

NIXON
We must recognize that one excess
begets another and that the
extremes of violence in the 1960s
contributed to the extremes of
Watergate

On Wendy as she regards the TV hearing her parents
farewells as they leave through the front door

EXT WILLIAMS HOUSE NIGHT

A large New England Colonial with a few modern additions and
touches We hear the sound of dinner chatter

INT WILLIAMS DINING ROOM NIGHT

The kitchen door swings open into the dining room and Mikey
and Sandy Williams emerge each holding platters of food
Mikey 15-and-a-half lost in space and Sandy 14 a sullen
and barely pubescent boy each have towels draped over their
forearms -- they are the evenings waiters

They move unsteadily to the table at which sit their parents
Janey (38 a hard-edged sharp-witted beauty) and Jim (43
large and a bit goofy a genius inventor) together with
their guests Ben and Elena Hood and neighbors Dorothy and
Ted Franklin

We jump cut through the evenings conversations seen mostly
from the furtive POVs of the boys

BEN
His brother came back --

DOROTHY
From where

BEN
Vietnam

DOROTHY
Oh Are we going to talk about
this about

ELENA
You should hear Its very sad he
was --

JUMP CUT

Janey is whispering something into Mikeys ear who returns
to the kitchen

JIM
It was a benefit for the ACLU or
something and Harry Reems himself
was there --

DOROTHY
The man with the -- from Deep
Throat

JIM
The very one -- something about a

first amendment defense fund --
well I believe in it --

DOROTHY
Ted took me to see it

JANEY
Ted how romantic

DOROTHY
I have to say the movie didnt do
much for me But being in that
theater surrounded by all those
horny young college boys and
perverts there was something in
the air that --
JUMP CUT
The boys are pouring wine

JIM
-- pulls right up to the pump
jumps out like theres no gas
shortage oblivious and by this
point everybody in lines piling
out of their cars ready to kill the
guy when they notice its that
Reverend Edwards --

BEN
The Unitarian The new one

JIM
Yeah -- claims he pulled off Creek
Road and didnt notice the line
going back Mill Street for half a
mile

BEN
Hes either got his head in the
clouds or up his --

DOROTHY
I hear hes slept with half the
women in his congregation --

TED
Lucky bastard

As this is said Mikey accidentally spills some wine on Ben

BEN
Hell -- I mean no problemo there
Mikey Here I --

Janey leans over with her napkin and attempts a cursory wipe
of Bens pants Is there a just barely noticeable frisson
between Ben and Janey as she removes the napkin If there is
Elena doesnt -- or pretends not to -- notice

CUT TO

The boys now in pajamas (Sandys with padded feet Mikeys a
combination of t-shirt and pj bottoms) are bringing out
coffee and dessert The adults eye Mikeys handling of the
coffee pot with some nervousness

DOROTHY
(unconvincing)
So fascinating Do you get free
tickets to the movies that kind of
thing
BEN
No my job is just to analyze the
entertainment stocks and advise our
institutional investors on where to
put their money Its --

ELENA
Dont be so modest Ben Its a job
that requires a certain prescience
with regards to entertainment
trends You were the first to
predict that Billy Jack would be a
hit --

BEN
(with a bit too much
conviction)
And as usual no one believed me

Silence

CUT TO
The dinner party has moved to the living room for after
dinner drinks Elena remains behind to help Janey pick up the

table She stacks a plate on top of another

JANEY
Please dont

ELENA
Its not a bother

JANEY
I insist
(beat)
Dont touch them

Elena realizes that theres an edge to Janeys voice

ELENA
Oh

JANEY
(realizing shes gone too
far)
Its really quite all right

ELENA
Of course

INT WILLIAMS LIVING ROOM NIGHT

The party progresses Mikey and Sandy are lying on their
stomachs at the top of the stairs out of sight

DOROTHY
And to think -- they met at a key
party of all things

ELENA
A key party

DOROTHY
You know its a California thing
That scuzzy husband of hers dragged
her kicking and screaming to one
when they were out in LA you
know the men put their car keys in
a bowl and then at the end of the
evening the women line up and fish
them out and go home with whoevers
keys theyve got Anyhow thats how
she met this Rod person or whatever
his name is and hes left his wife
and shes packing for California
Irwin is devastated Its so
ironic

JANEY
Ironic

DOROTHY
(caught out)
Well um yes Ironic His name is
Rod

INT WILLIAMS FRONT HALLWAY NIGHT

The guests are leaving The men shake hands the women kiss

and the men and women awkwardly peck each others

ELENA
Thank you Janey

DOROTHY
It was lovely

Hey Jim next time youve got to
fill me in on whatever it is youre
up to these days

JIM
Will do

INT STAIRWAY NIGHT

cheeks

At the top of the stairs a rather dejected Sandy and Mikey
finish spying on the leave-takings below Mikey nudges Sandy

and they silently head back the upstairs hall

INT MIKES ROOM NIGHT
They enter Mikes room -- the door has a nuclear waste
positively no admittance sign on it

As Mikey reaches his bed he doubles over groaning and
starts to make retching noises He then throws himself onto
the bed his head leaning over the far side

Sandy walks over and sees a pile of vomit next to the bed
Taken aback for a moment he then reaches forward and picks
it up -- its fake plastic vomit He throws it on top of
Mikes back but Mikey doesnt take notice

SANDY
Stupid
(pause looking sullenly
at Mikes back)
Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend

MIKEY
(not looking up but
alarmed)
Who said so

SANDY
No one

MIKEY
I dont have a girlfriend

Mikey returns to his reading -- a copy of The Sensuous Woman
obviously well pawed over He absentmindedly picks his nose
As he flips the pages a beautiful almost electrical HUMMING
SOUND begins to fill his ears He frowns and pauses to listen
to it

Sandy who has picked up a balsa wood miniature plane
obviously doesnt hear it

Mikey focuses on the plane as Sandy waves it through the air
Perhaps the hum is the sound of its engines as it soars
through the sky

INT WENDYS BEDROOM NIGHT
There is a large poster of a cartoon version of Richard Nixon

Tricky Dick -- on her wall Wendy is on the phone to her
friend Beth

WENDY
-- he knows that when the March
24th tape -- you know with Dean

where Dean tells him that theres a
cancer growing on the presidency --

She pauses as Beth asks a question

WENDY (CONTD)
Who No way Hes like a big
infected whitehead wearing jeans I
wouldnt --

She hears the downstairs door open
WENDY (CONTD)
(whispering)
-- shit its my parents
She turns her light out
INT HOOD UPSTAIRS HALLWAY NIGHT
Ben and Elena walking past Wendys room to their bedroom
BEN
Youd think shed learn how to cook
a chicken eh My drumstick was

still frozen when you cut inside

whatever that disease -- and Jim
how that guy ever became a
millionaire --

He pauses before a hall table and with his eyes traces the
telephone cord under Wendys room

BEN (CONTD)
Hmm I knew shed still be up
Watch this --

But Elena simply continues into the master bedroom

He starts to pull gently on the cord And continues pulling
No response for a few seconds Then

BEN

Wendy opens the door to her room

sent you to one of those Southern
military academies a long time ago
Now get to bed
She slams the door

He opens it

INT WENDYS BEDROOM NIGHT
Ben enters the room angry

BEN
Hey

Wendy jumps into bed and under the covers pulling them up
over her head He stands over her looking down at the
crumpled pile of sheet and blanket

BEN (CONTD)
(softening)
Hey kiddo Sleep well huh

He places his hand where her cheek should be and caresses
the sheet

WENDY
(without pulling the sheet
down but nicely)
Good-night dad

BEN
Good night kiddo

Ben turns to the door where he sees a silent Elena standing
in her nightgown a slight smile on her face

INT HOOD BEDROOM NIGHT

Elena is sitting cross-legged eyes closed on her side of
the bed We hear the toilet flush from the master bath and
see Ben emerge in his boxers He pauses in front of the bed
looking at Elena

ELENA
(without opening her eyes)
Youre staring at me

BEN
I wasnt star--

ELENA
Ive been thinking Ben about
Wendy I was going to ask if shed
come with me sometime to meet Dr
Woolens

BEN
That shrink -- the one you always
wanted me to see I thought you

ELENA
I did but -- somebody should
probably see her talk to her
You think shes ok

BEN
Why shouldnt she be

Elena just gives him a look more sad than angry

Silence

BEN (CONTD)
(pause)
Then again why should she be I
mean with us with our

ELENA
So maybe youll come too

BEN
Oh not again Elena If weve got

ELENA

INT SHACKLEY AND SCHWIMMER CONFERENCE ROOM DAY

Ben seated is finishing a brief presentation to a small
group of men which includes George Clair mid-thirties
unctuously handsome

BEN

But what exactly is stagflation
this mixture of inflation and
stagnation and how should we in
the securities industry understand
and accommodate it Well -- and I
hope Im not out of bounds here -
think of the money supply as a
large male organ continuously
inflating and yet the societal
vaginal cavity simply wants more
As the vicious circle of higher
returns without real satisfaction
continues the money-organ may seem
to be in demand but in fact even
the most inflated capital is
unwanted This is why I suggest
that while we engage this mawing
abyss for the highest returns we
at the same time fantasize so to
speak of the safe harbor of
capital appreciation

The aging boss nods agreement
SHACKLEY
(more or less mumbling)
Brilliant brilliant
George Clair just grins

INT BEN HOODS OFFICE DAY

Ben is gathering papers readying to leave He looks up to
see George Clair in his doorway

GEORGE
Hey there Benjie youre becoming
quite the in-house philosopher
When do you have time to think up
all that stuff -- Shackley sure
eats it up

INTERCUT HALL IN FRONT OF BEN HOODS OFFICE

As we see that Clair is deftly fondling Hoods attractive
secretary as she is seated in the cubicle beside the door to
his office She looks up coyly at Clair hidden for the
moment from Bens view

Ben comes out of his office pulling his coat on Clair and
the secretary pull back but its clear that Ben has some
sense of whats transpiring between them

BEN
George Im just trying to get a
global view of things -- cant just

look at the small picture
Theres an obvious rivalry between the two of them

GEORGE
And speaking of which you have
those market share charts Mr
Shackley was asking about

BEN
Gotcha George not a problem
Tomorrow Hey you want to start
covering the old filmed
entertainment sector yourself

GEORGE
Ben you know thats your territory
- and I wouldnt dream to trespass
- youre the expert Hey how do
you think Paramounts gonna do with
that Blatty novel whats it
called The Exorcist

BEN
Overpriced bomb cost over 6
million -- no stars and no ones

into the horror genre these days
anyway Im advising the company
recommend reducing positions there
Its disaster films that are gonna
stay at the top

EXT NEW CANAAN HIGH SCHOOL FIELD DAY

A cool gray afternoon A group of boys are playing flag
football on the field while two groups of girls are gathered
underneath the bleachers at either end warily smoking
clgarettes

Wendy Beth and a couple of other girls are gathered in one
group

BETH
(referring to one of the
girls gathered in the
other group)
She said you licked Dave Brewsters
weenie in the third floor bathroom

WENDY
Shes a liar I wouldnt touch Dave
Brewsters dick if you paid me
Its probably crawling with vd
after he put it in her which he
did

The conversation peters out at this point as the two groups
of girls give each other the hairy eyeball from afar

Wendy looks through from beneath the bleacher seats onto the
field where the boys are playing

A group of boys break from a huddle Mikey among them

The quarterback takes the hike and Mikey runs out for a pass
As he runs his breathing increases in volume filling his
e
b

ars and transforming into the humming sound hed heard

The quarterback spots him and throws a long one

He runs in an oblivion of beautiful white sound

The ball drops next to him as he continues in a world of his
own to run

Suddenly the humming ends and he stops and turns around to
see all the other kids just standing there looking at him
One of them makes a pot-smoking gesture as if thats the
explanation

MIKEY
(as he returns to the
group ball in hand)
Did anybody hear that

The other kids snicker Wendy looks on and catches Mikeys
eye for a fleeting moment

WENDY
I gotta go

She takes hold of her bicycle and pushes off
INT COFFEE SHOP DAY

Elena and Philip are seated at a booth

Its been a tremendously
transformative year -- maybe a

little controversial of course but
were breaking down the old
Unitarian barriers --

ELENA
I suppose my reluctance was the
group aspect of it -- Ive never

been much of a joiner although I
still consider myself a somewhat
religious person --

PHILIP
Well I of course flatter myself
that our church is not exactly what
most people would call organized
religion -- at times its the
disorganization thats liberating --
and of course Ive begun to
minister much more in what one
might call therapeutic
environments in small groups and
one on one couples --

Elena looks outside the window and sees Wendy speed past on
her bicycle

ELENA
(cutting him off)
My daughter I havent been on a
bike for years
(still not really looking

at him)
When was the last time you rode a
bike
PHILIP

(a bit taken aback by the
abrupt topic change)
They say you never forget
ELENA
(jarred back to his
presence)

Forget what

PHILIP
Forget how to ride a bike

Silence
ELENA
No of course you dont youre
right

INT FIVE AND DIME STORE DAY

Wendy moves with a certain amount of stealth through the
aisles arriving at the candy selection

She looks around

She takes a package of twinkies and slips them into the
oversized pockets of her painters pants

She turns around and her breath goes out of her -- an OLD
WOMAN has been watching her shoplift The woman looks sadly
at her but says nothing Wendy slowly walks past her and out
the back door of the store The woman looks on

EXT FIVE AND DIME STORE DAY

As she walks her bike onto the sidewalk Wendy comes across
Sandy

SANDY

fall day

EXT SILVER MEADOWS PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE DAY

booth

Once a bit past the gate she gets off her bike and walks it
into a grove of trees near the front drive

EXT SILVER MEADOWS DAY

Mikey is waiting amid the trees next to his bike as Wendy
arrives

EXT SILVER MEADOWS SWIMMING POOL DAY

The wind is picking up and the light is fading Mikey and
Wendy climb the fence around the pool which is empty and
half-covered in dead leaves and twigs

They climb down into the concrete recess and walk into the
deep end leaning against the far wall of the pool

They each matter-of-factly take their gum out and put it
behind their ears

They begin not so much to kiss as to place their tongues in
each others mouths

We see them from high above the pool as the dead leaves
swirl lightly around them Mikey groping under Wendys
poncho

EXT WILLIAMS HOUSE DAY
To establish
INT WILLIAMS GUEST ROOM DAY

A couple are in the final throes of lovemaking We see Janey
Williamss face more or less enjoying the proceedings The
man gives a final heave and groan and rolls off to reveal
himself to be -- Ben Hood

JUMP CUT TO
Janey smokes a cigarette Ben is babbling

BEN
We were golfing and you know
golfing to me is something Im
supposed to enjoy and I was on the
goddam golf team in college so
its something one would assume I
do well -- I used to do well -- but
basically these days golfing for me
is like hoeing or plowing

Janey smiles briefly at this

BEN (CONTD)
Its like farming I am basically
chewing up large tracts of
expensively landscaped scenery with
overpriced sticks and George Clair
has obviously in the mere two
years since he joined the firm he
has obviously been taking secret
lessons with a golf pro and I
assume the entirety of his
disposable income has been devoted
to humiliating me on the golf
course And the guy talks -
incessantly -- throughout the
entirety of the miserable 18 holes
- on topics that are the supposed
domain of my department --

JANEY
Ben--
BEN
Yeah
JANEY
(gently)

Youre boring me I have a husband
I dont particularly feel the need
for another

BEN
You have a point there Thats a
very good point Were having an
affair Right An explicitly sexual
relationship Your needs My needs
Youre absolutely right

You should probably get dressed

The boys will be home soon

Gotcha

She wraps a blanket around herself and gets up

Mikey Williams

WENDY

ELENA
Well you looked very -- free --

Wendy continues setting the table

ELENA (CONTD)
Weightless almost -- as if I were
seeing my own memories of being a
girl There was something internal
about it

WENDY
Mom Are you ok

ELENA
Wendy of course Im sorry You
must think Im ripe to be checked
into Silver Meadows

WENDY
Youre not a psycho

ELENA
The people at Silver Meadows arent
psychos

WENDY

I know Theyre rich drug addicts
and celebrities When I saw James
Taylor there and --

ELENA
Weve been through this Wendy
James Taylor was actually at that
clinic up near Boston

WENDY
Well I saw what I saw and if you
dont want to believe me --

ELENA
Oh Wendy
Wendy frowns

WENDY
They need the money for my band
uniform at school

ELENA
I thought you quit the band - I
never hear you practice anymore

WENDY
I dont really need to practice I

I thought maybe Id stay in

ELENA
Well Im sure your father and I
would love to hear what youre
playing these days Maybe after
dinner

INT HOOD LIVING ROOM NIGHT
Ben and Elena take their seats on the sofa Wendy stands
before them holding an enormous trombone with a music stand

and sheet music in front of her

She puffs a series of seemingly disconnected notes in waltz
time

When shes done she looks up from the sheet music to her
parents

They applaud
BEN
Cant wait to see how it fits in
with all the other instruments
Elena gives him a look

INT HOOD KITCHEN NIGHT

ELENA

He walks uncertainly from the room Does she suspect

INT MIKES ROOM NIGHT

Mikey is painfully at work writing an English essay Sandy
comes to the door with a geometry textbook

SANDY
Mikey
MIKEY
Yeah
SANDY
Geometry
MIKEY

Sure anything but this English
Sandy puts the open textbook in front of him

SANDY

Why are you so good at math but not
in English

MIKEY
Im not good at math Just
geometry
He looks at the book

MIKEY (CONTD)

(drawing out his examples

on a piece of paper)
Its like you know when they say
two squared And you think it
means 2 times 2 equals 4 But
really they really mean a square A
square with a side of two And the
area of the square is four Like
every time you use the word like
squared or cubed its really
space its not numbers its
space
And its perfect space but only in
your head because you cant draw a
perfect square like in the
material world but in your mind
you can have perfect space

(pause)
You know

As Mikey goes on we see his geometric doodles and hear
faintly the HUMMING SOUND under his voice

SANDY
Yeah But I just need some help
with my homework

A knock at the door Jim stands in the doorway with a
suitcase in his hand

JIM
Hey guys Im back

MIKEY
(honestly confused)
You were gone

Sandy looks at Mikey as if pondering a lost cause

JIM

(a look of

disappointment)
Yeah Mikey Yep I was in Houston
working on some great new ideas
about silicon which comes from
sand very conductive How you guys
doing Hows school

Mikeys still flustered

MIKEY
Uh I dunno OK I guess
JIM
Hmm Alright

He walks off

SANDY
You really didnt notice Man hes
been gone for three days

INT WILLIAMS BEDROOM NIGHT

Janey is reading still dressed on the bed She nods to Jim
as he enters with his suitcase

JANEY
Good trip

He nods and puts his suitcase down then sits heavily on the
side of the bed

JIM
(as he sits)
You bet

It turns out its a water bed and his weight creates a wave
that nearly pushes Janey off her edge of the bed

JANEY
Jesus Jim

JIM
(jumping up which only
creates another wave)
Sorry honey Hell weve got to
trade this thing in for a normal
bed

JANEY
Just be careful

JIM
(as he begins to unpack)
You notice anything with Mikey
lately The kid seemed a little out
of it tonight eh

JANEY
Tonight Jim hes been out of it
since he was born
JIM
Hell I guess he takes after me
huh
He laughs to himself

She gives him a look
INT COFFEE SHOP DAY
Elena and Philip Edwards are having coffee again

PHILIP
In many ways the church-bound
tradition of the father son and
holy ghost is simply a version of
the parent-child-adult triad within
us all Its a primitive set of
symbols for our inner psychology

ELENA
Youre saying that Christ is the
child and --

PHILIP
-- And God the angry parent and
the Spirit the hope of an
integrated adult self

ELENA
All well and good -- But tell me
again what is it exactly that you
believe in

PHILIP
You ask what the point is

ELENA
Thats right

PHILIP
Self-realization Ministering to
help people reach their fullest
potential Would you believe me if
I told you I want you to see
yourself reach your fullest
potential and self-realization

ELENA
I would say it sounds like youre
trying to get me into bed

PHILIP
If thats a potential you see
yourself fulfilling I mean
(flustered)

My I sound a bit --

ELENA
Im sorry That was stupid of me I
didnt mean to be so rude

PHILIP
You werent You actually for some
reason you have the effect on me
of making me feel just a tiny bit
ashamed of myself

ELENA
But not too ashamed

PHILIP
(smiling)
Now you are being rude

ELENA
And youre still trying to get me
into bed

PHILIP
Ouch

Just then Dorothy Franklin passes by their table a smirk
firmly implanted on her face

DOROTHY
Hello you two Am I barging in on
some kind of religious study group
Elena you look marvelous Will I
see you and Ben at the Halfords

ELENA
I suppose well make an appearance

DOROTHY
And Reverend Edwards Did you make
the list

PHILIP
(laughing)
I believe so Mrs Franklin

DOROTHY
With the two of you there it will
be positively a revival Im off

She scurries out of the coffee shop

PHILIP
Im afraid shes something of a
gossip isnt she

ELENA

(gathering her things to

go)
Im afraid people around here
provide her with quite a bit to
gossip about

(getting up)
Take care
PHILIP
That I will indeed

INT CLASSROOM DAY
Mikey is reading his English paper before the class

MIKEY
Because of molecules we are
connected to the outside world from
our bodies Like when you smell
things because when you smell a
smell its not really a smell its
a part of the object that has come
off of it -- molecules So when you
smell something bad its like ina
way youre eating it This is why
you should not really smell things
in the same way that you dont eat
everything in the world around you
- because as a smell it gets
inside of you So the next time you
go into the bathroom after someone
else has been there remember what
kinds of molecules you are in fact
eating

An embarrassed silence
INT SCHOOL MUSIC ROOM DAY

Band practice The New Canaan High School band is doing a
wind version of a popular rock tune

bottoms incongruously blowing away on her trombone -- this
being her one stab at extracurricular activities

In the flute section directly behind her is Sandy piping
away on a tiny piccolo He sits on a riser slightly elevated

above her

He directs downward at Wendy a protracted regard a look of
intense concentration on his face

SANDYS POV
Wendys backside her pants pushed outward in the back
affording Sandy a libido-charged view of the top of her bum

crack

Push in on a close-up of this cherished abstract landscape
then back to Sandys furrowed face

in her pocket

We see her reflection in the security mirror above the aisle
as she quickly exits the store

The middle-aged lady behind the counter watches her leave
EXT FIVE AND DIME DAY
In a wide shot from across the street we see Elena leave

the store followed by the shopkeeper who runs behind her and
taps her on the shoulder They converse for a minute and
Elena is accompanied back into the store

Through the store windows we see her take the lipstick out of
her purse Shes obviously distraught -- offering to pay
talking quickly etc The shopkeeper is holding a telephone
not yet decided on whether to call her in

PAUL (VO)
To find yourself in the Negative
Zone as the Fantastic Four often
do means that all everyday
assumptions are inverted -- even
the invisible girl herself becomes
visible and so she loses the last
semblance of her power

to steady himself

PAUL

About

Well the whole gamut Facts of

because I tell you theres things
happening that youre probably old
enough well

(pause)
For example on the self-abuse
front -- now this is important -
its not advisable to do it in the
shower -- it wastes water and
electricity and because we all
expect you to be doing it there in
any case -- and um not onto the
linen and not on your sisters
underwear or any clothing belonging
to your mother --

He pauses to gauge the effect of his monologue on his son
then continues

PAUL

She sits next to him he kisses the back of her neck
BEN

BEN (CONTD)

(thinking aloud)
Maybe its all for the better you

Yesterday at dinner well she

JANEY
(almost ironic)

vantage point from which to observe
her

BEN

lot lately and -- No thats not
it I guess weve just been on the
verge of saying something whatever
it is just saying something to
each other On the verge

Janey gets up

JANEY

Benjamin looks at her quizzically

BEN
Huh

JANEY
Birth control

BEN
Right Gotcha
She leaves the room

He leans back onto the bed Sits back up Takes a sip of
vodka Puts the glass down Takes his socks off Hes now in
just his jockey shorts and shirt

Faintly he hears a door close The front door

He takes another sip

He hears another sound

BEN (CONTD)
Janey

Nothing
He goes to the door and carefully opens it
BEN (CONTD)
(quietly)

Janey

He hears quite audibly a car door open close Janeys car

He runs to a front window just in time to catch a glimpse of
her driving off

BEN (CONTD)

INT GUEST ROOM LATER

Benjamin sits on the guest bed still in his underwear
drinking from the bottle

He gets up and starts to wander around the house still
holding the bottle

INT MASTER BEDROOM CONTD

Benjamin saunters through He presses on the king-sized bed --
it undulates

BEN

He wiggles comically making more waves
JUMP CUT
Ben idly goes through Janeys drawers

INT WILLIAMS MASTER BATHROOM CONTD
He rifles through the bathroom cabinet checking out the
medicines

INT WILLIAMS BEDROOM CONTD

He notices a garter belt hanging from the walk-in closet
door He picks it up and twirls it

INT MIKEYS ROOM CONTD
Benjamin walks in an obvious look of distaste

He sorts through a few of Mikes things -- monster eyes that
glow in the dark The Sensuous Woman etc

He twirls the garter belt absentmindedly then tosses it into
the back of Mikes closet

INT GUEST ROOM CONTD

He finishes putting his clothes back on As he reaches for
the door he hears voices and quickly steps back in again

Teenage voices Mikey and Wendy
MIKEY (0S)
See no ones here Maybe you want

WENDY (OS)
Maybe we can just watch some TV

MIKEY (0OS)

WENDY

MIKEY
Why did you -- with Sandy

WENDY
I dont know

MIKEY
You like him He worships you
But Wendy doesnt seem to hear -- shes drawn to an object
lying next to a bean bag chair off to one side

WENDY
Hey whats this

With a look of utter fascination she picks up a Nixon mask
looking at it as though it were an archeological find

WENDY (CONTD)
Wow

MIKEY
Wendy

She puts the mask on

WENDY
(from behind the mask)
I wont take my pants off But Ill
touch it Thats as far as it goes

Mikey looks totally confused
Remaining fully clothed Wendy loosens Mikes belt showing
no excitement from behind her mask and lets him climb on top

of her for a dry hump

Just then a shaft of light hits them from the top of the
stairs -- Ben towers above them looking down

Mikey flips over immediately and pulls his clothes together
grabbing a TV Guide as Wendy stands up the mask still on

As Ben descends Mikey still stuffing his shirt-tail into his
pants pretends to flip through the TV Guide

MIKEY
(muttering)

When worlds collide

WENDY
Huh

MIKEY

Ben arrives folds his arms
BEN

puddle

BEN (CONTD)
Your toes cold

WENDY

intimacy

chatting up an attractive younger woman

GORMAN

Ben feels a wave of distaste at the joke

He looks across the room as Maria and her son Neil (stringy
hair acne tie-dyed turtleneck patched jeans) are engaging
Janey and Philip Edwards in conversation

INT LIBBETS APARTMENT NIGHT

Paul Francis and Libbets sit on the floor listening to the

at his feet facing up to him

(consciousness fading
fast)
Hah hah youre funny A bath Like

Her head bobs and weaves her eyes close and suddenly her
head falls forward with a whoosh toward the couch -- smack
dab between Pauls legs

She begins to snore instantly her open mouth nuzzling into
his crotch

Paul doesnt move doesnt even breathe Then slowly he
leans his back into the couch without shifting the rest of
his body

He looks as though he has simultaneously won the lottery and
received a lobotomy

INT HALFORDS NIGHT
The crowds a bit thinner than before

As Dot Halford begins calling out for everyones attention a
few couples make their last-minute way to the door

DOT
OK everyone We have a little

She scoops up the bowl and places it on a high end table
which has been put in the middle of the room

Paul hangs up the phone and looks down at Libbets
Libbets Allman Brothers tape has run out The machine makes
a repeated clicking sound as the take up real continues to
circle The only other sound is the noise of the wind and
rain lashing against the apartments windows

collective sigh of relief goes up from behind him Ben looks
on momentarily triumphant
Elena smiles to herself

Elena steps forward Benjamin is obviously agitated

Close on Janeys hands selecting -- away from Bens equine
key ring
She lifts up another key ring -- Neil Conrad the teenager

She hands the self-important-looking Neil his keys and they
turn to go

Jim Williams smiles mysteriously to himself

Ben suddenly lurches forward semi-drunkenly trying to
separate Neil from Janey

THE GROUP

He backs off ashamed and taking a step backwards trips
over the coffee table
Mark Boland helps lift him up

BEN

She takes the bowl and dips her hand in Two sets are left
One her own she avoids She takes out Jims keys and walks
across the room handing them to him

JIM
Thanks but -- oh I dont think

discouraging evening
ELENA
You couldnt have hoped for much
better when you came up the walk

JIM
Somehow it was different in my
imagination when I thought about

They sit down on the sofa

They both

JIM
You want coffee or something

ELENA
Well maybe they have one of those
filter jobs in the kitchen --

JIM
Look Elena the fact that were
neighbors you know close
friends well it sort of makes this
a little strange dont you think

ELENA
My husband is probably passed out
in the bathroom or at least he
wishes he were Ive been married
to him for 17 years and I dont
have any intention of going in
there to get him so what Im
proposing is that since your wife
has gone off with a boy and since
you are standing here alone Im
proposing that you and I do what

ELENA
Okay Shall we clean up around here

JIM
Nah that wasnt in the contract

seeping from underneath the bathroom door She hears the
sound of running water from inside

Then she goes into a sideroom and joins Jim They pick up
their coats

Covering their faces they jog to his car an oversized
Cadillac A thick glaze of ice forms on his windshield

INT JIMS CADILLAC NIGHT

thing for a while

He turns on the ignition and the vents start to blow cold
air at them

He leans over and kisses her

ELENA
Do these seats go back

That starts it He jumps at her unbuckling her and unzipping
himself

They tangle uncomfortably for a few seconds And then
comically hes in her

With a groan its over in a flash
Jim pulls himself off readjusting his pants

JIM
That was awful really awful Im
so sorry Elena

Elena has somehow worked herself into the cavity of the glove
compartment and is trying to figure out how to extricate
herself

JIM
Things are really rotten at home
You wouldnt believe how rotten
Janeys sick Shes unstable I
guess its not the right time to
tell you but thats it -- its

EXT WILLIAMS HOUSE NIGHT

Wendy walks up the drive in the rain pauses then goes to
the front door and knocks lightly The door swings ajar She
pushes on it and lets herself in

INT WILLIAMS HOUSE NIGHT

WENDY
Anyone home Hello

Wendy wanders into the living room then climbs the steps
The sound of the wind and the darkness begin to scare her

She goes into Mikeys room -- its even more of a disaster
zone than usual

She sees on the wall his dark-light poster of the 12 (sexual)
positions of the zodiac

She notices the black garter belt on the floor and picks it
up absentmindedly swinging it in her hand as she walks out
of the room

She walks back down the stairs and into the kitchen leaving
the garter belt on the counter

She opens the refrigerator grabs a jar of peanut butter and
scoops some up in her finger As she puts her finger in her
mouth --

SANDY
Wendy

She gives out a little yelp
WENDY

Sandy you scared the shit out of

Silence

JIM

They pause for a moment

The street lamp above them sizzles but stays on

They start to walk
INT LIBBETS APARTMENT NIGHT

Paul and Libbets still frozen in the same position Finally
Paul gently pushes Libbets head back

It slides off his leg and as Paul lurches forward in a
failed attempt to grab it Libbets flops backwards her head
hitting the carpet with a dull but decidedly loud thump

PAUL
Oh shit

Paul gets up looks down at her
She snores
He runs over to a side table and sees the clock 1110

PAUL (CONTD)
Oh shit oh shit

He grabs his comic books and runs for the door
INT TAXI NIGHT

INT SANDYS ROOM NIGHT

Sandy and Wendy are sitting on the floor He grabs his GI
Joe

SANDY
Check this out Hes supposed to

like malfunctioned
He pulls the dog tag on the doll and GI Joe emits a
plastic macho voice

GI JOE
Mayday Mayday Get this message

SANDY
Same thing Again and again

Wendy takes the doll and yanks the cord
GI JOE

Mayday Mayday Get this message

SANDY

blackout Do you have candles in
your house
I know where the candles are and I
have my own flashlight Over there

exit is on this floor

During the course of his monologue as Wendy looks on Sandy
calmly ties a noose for his doll

SANDY
This knots called a bowline

He puts the noose over the dolls head as Wendy holds him

GI JOE
Mayday Mayday

SANDY
Lets hang him

Sandy drapes the noose over the edge of a dresser drawer
GI Joe dangles They both look at him in silence

The silence continues

WENDY
Hes dead

SANDY
If it wasnt raining we could take
him outside and blow him up

WENDY
He wouldnt blow up Hed just get
all mangled or twisted
She takes him down and lays him flat on the bed And then
begins to remove his clothes

Sandy looks on desirous

WENDY
Well
(noticing his lack of
anatomy)
It looks like someone got to his
private parts before us

SANDY
Communist Viet Cong

WENDY
They left it in the jungle

They speak with high seriousness

Wendy slides up on the bed where Sandy sits a pillow on his
lap and one by one with exaggerated slowness she removes
her snowboots as if they were stiletto heels

WENDY
Can I get into your bed
(pause)
With you

Sandy begins to shake

SANDY
We -- we have to go to the guest
room We cant stay in here What
if Mikey My parents

WENDY
Dont worry about them Theyre at
that party getting drunk and
falling all over each other and
making jokes about McGovern and

Sandy begins to cry

SANDY

She takes his hand and they walk out of the room and down
the hall into the guest room

INT GUEST ROOM NIGHT

Wendy and Sandy enter She sees the vodka bottle on the
dresser

WENDY
Want a drink

SANDY
Vodka

WENDY
You never tasted the stuff

She fills the glass to the brim and hands the bottle to
Sandy

They clink and each toss back a sip -- Wendy almost the
entire glass

Sandy coughs and gags but swallows

WENDY
Try again
He does
SANDY
It feels warm
WENDY
One more shot
SANDY
Okay
They drink
WENDY

Under the covers
Under they go and soon every layer of clothing emerges
WENDY
(feeling her way)
Get em off

Sandy begins to laugh and soon Wendy joins him

They roll around on top of each other for a while

WENDY
Have you ever had a nocturnal
emission

SANDY
Huh

WENDY

Thats the name for when you wake
up and find this little pool of
sticky stuff like after a sexy
dream
Sandy shakes his head
WENDY
They didnt tell you this stuff
yet What planet do you live on

Sandy doesnt answer but climbs back on top of her and
kisses her neck

SANDY
I love you

WENDY
Thats nice Are you drunk

SANDY
I dont know How do I know

WENDY

around when you lie down

Sandy rolls off her and lies on his back

Mikey walks along the edge of the empty pool in the rain He
climbs up on the diving board and bounces lightly on it but
then gets off and stands looking down at the pool again
EXT SILVER MEADOW NIGHT

Mikey walks across the field

EXT STREET NIGHT

The storm has let up Mikey walks along With a running
start he slides on the ice down a hill

He walks back up and slides again hollering with joy He is
an image of a tiny yet absolute and positive freedom

The streetlights sputter on then off
INT WILLIAMS GUEST ROOM NIGHT
Sandy and Wendy lie asleep

EXT STREET NIGHT
A power line is down It hisses and HUMS -- a humming very
much like the humming Mikey has been hearing earlier

The humming takes on the same transcendent tonality to which
Mikey has become so accustomed at such moments

Mikey sits down on a metal street guardrail to ponder the
sound and the snaking coil of electricity

A strange look of almost religious wonder overcomes his face
as the power line connects to the guardrail

MIKEY
Oh shit

Glued by an electrical pulse to the rail he shakes as the
current flows through him

After a minute his body slumps and slides down the road
INT TRAIN NIGHT

As Paul sits reading on he moving train the lights inside
begin to sputter and the train begins to slow After a few
moments the train grinds to a halt and Paul and his few
fellow late night passengers are left in near total dark
with only the light of an emergency exit sign above Pauls
head to light the scene

The train is eerily silent

JIM
Phones out I hope the pipes --
He walks into the kitchen The pipes have begun to burst
Theres a water leak running down the walls forming a puddle
on the floor
Elena has walked into the kitchen behind him She leans
against the counter picking up the garter belt without
thinking for a second then putting it back down

JIM

Oh well Why dont you put on some

dry socks -- and weve got some

rain boots in the guest closet back

INT WILLIAMS GUEST ROOM CONTD

She stands before the bed and gazes down on them

They look almost angelic

Wendy sensing her presence in the room opens her eyes
slowly coming out of sleep

Elena walks out of the room back to the kitchen

Wendy gets out of bed quietly leaving Sandy sleeping
peacefully

She looks at him lovingly and tucks the blanket back up
around him

and sees something He puts on his brakes
EXT STREET DAWN

Ben gets out of the car and stands on the top of an icy
embankment In a clump of bushes is the orange glow of a
parka

He walks hesitantly toward it Mikes body lies face down in
the wet ice

Ben leans down and turns the body over then stands back in
amazement and saddened shock

He stands there for a moment then picks Mikes body up
carrying him over the hill and onto the street We see now
that he is parked just a short block from the Williamss
house

He bypasses his car and walks directly down the street toward
the house The effort is obviously enormous He falls from
time to time then gets back up

INT TRAIN PRE-DAWN
Various passengers asleep

Paul hunched up in his seat under the faint emergency exit
light cold He reads his comic book by the light of the
emergency exit

DONT YOU SEE SUE HE WAS TOO

POWERFUL IF HIS ENERGY HAD

DESTROYED THE WORLD

trains engines returns

The conductor enters the car blasting forth in his classic
nasal train conductor voice

CONDUCTOR
Good morning ladies and gentlemen --

On Paul squinting in the harsh light

The train moves slowly through a suburban semi-forested
landscape On the street below the bridge an emergency

They stand there looking down at Mikey
Behind Elena and Wendy Jim appears

He pushes softly by them toward the body of his son

BEN
Jim -- he was just up -- in Silver
Lane -- I think maybe -- a power

line --
Jim picks up his son
He carries him silently into the house

Sandy now standing inside the foyer pushes himself back
against the wall as they pass without expression

After a moment from outside the Hoods can hear Jims
wailing

BEN
Do you think Maybe we should call
someone --

ELENA
The phones out

BEN (CONTD)

She turns back up the front steps and gently goes in --
INT WILLIAMS LIVING ROOM CONTD

on the living room floor Jim is hugging Mikes body his
shoulders shaking uncontrollably sobbing

Wendy walks and stands next to Sandy who is filled
momentarily with a brief inexplicable rush of anger toward
her -- but she takes him and gives him an awkward childlike
hug then turns and runs out the door joining Ben and Elena
on the driveway Sandy watches her go his face wet with
tears
