Weir opens his eyes waking from dream Sweat beads his
ascetic etched face Many years a scientist
He turns on the bedside lamp revealing a couples apartment
Decorated by a woman but Weir is alone unless you count
photographs His nightstand looks like a shrine to a beautiful
woman

Weir reaches to the stand Picks up
RECENT UNFRAMED PHOTO

The woman appears thin and haggard and wears a small brave
smile

Weir lies back on the bed Looks at the photo Presses it to
his forehead and closes his eyes Trying to be with her
just one more time
WEIR
(whisper)
I miss you

sits behind his desk a gruff career officer and a good man

Weir enters escorted by Hollis adjutant LYLE

WEIR
You wanted to see me Admiral

HOLLIS
I apologize for the short notice
Bill but weve had something come
up that requires your immediate
attention Lyle

INT HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM

Lyle activates a holographic display of the solar system A
box magnifies the eighth planet Neptune revealing a flashing
red dot in its orbit

INT DAYLIGHT OFFICE

LYLE
At oh-three-hundred this morning
TDRSS picked up an automated
navigation beacon broadcasting at
two minute intervals in Neptune orbit

Lyle hands Weir a stack of hardcopy data Weir reads the
data with growing excitement

WEIR
Incredible These are the same
coordinates before the ship
disappeared this this happened
This isnt some kind of hoax

HOLLIS
I wouldnt bring you here on a hoax
Houston confirms the telemetry and
ID codes

WEIR
(excited)
Its the Event Horizon Shes come
back

Hollis answers drily

HOLLIS
That ship was lost in deep space
seven years ago If the Titanic sailed
into New York harbor Id find it
more plausible
(beat)
Houston wants Aerospace to send out
a search and rescue team investigate
the source of the transmission If
it really is the Event Horizon
theyll attempt a salvage
(beat)
We need you to prepare a detailed
briefing on the ships systems for
the salvage crew

WEIR
A written briefing cant possibly
anticipate the variables on a mission
like this I have to go with them

Lyle looks at Weir stunned by the request

LYLE
Dr Weir you have no experience
with salvage procedures

WEIR
I designed the ships propulsion
system I am the only person capable
of evaluating the performance of the
gravity drive You cant send a Search
and Rescue team out there alone and
expect them to succeed That would
be like like sending an auto-
mechanic to work on the shuttle

LYLE
I can understand your desire to redeem
your reputation Dr Weir but it
doesnt factor into this

WEIR
This is not about my reputation
This is not about me at all
(beat passionate)
The Event Horizon was created for
one reason to go faster than light
Imagine mankind exploring new solar
systems colonizing new worlds Seven
years ago we didnt just lose the
ship and the crew We lost the dream
(beat quiet and
relentless)
I have to go

HOLLIS
Its not that simple
(off of Weirs

expression)
Lyle play the recording for Dr
Weir
LYLE

Navigation Control tried to hail the
vessel This was the only response

Lyle presses a button on Hollis desk An unholy GARBLE rips
from office speakers STATIC and NOISE and INHUMAN VOICES
Alone each sound would raise the hair on your neck Together
they are unbearable

The sound mercifully cuts off to STATIC Lyle stops the tape
Weir sits there stunned

LYLE

Since the initial transmission
theres been no further contact
Just the beacon every two minutes

WEIR
The crew Could they still be alive

LYLE
The ship had life support systems
for eighteen months Theyre been
gone seven years

WEIR
Someone sent that message Admiral
you have to put me on that ship

Hollis stares at Weir judging the man with his eyes

HOLLIS
Its against my better judgement
but Ill run this by the Man
downstairs Youll know my decision
by the end of the day

WEIR
Thank you
HOLLIS
Dont thank me Bill Im not doing
you any favors

Weir leaves The door closes behind him

LYLE
Youre not seriously considering
sending him

HOLLIS
You dont just dismiss Bill Weir
The man held Oppenheimers chair at
Princeton If the Event Horizon had
worked he would have gone down in
history as the greatest mind in
physics since Einstein

LYLE
The official inquiry blamed Weirs
design for the ships loss

HOLLIS

hat doesnt mean a damn thing They
ere looking for a scapegoat and

eir fit the bill But hes not
esponsible for what happened to the
hip

OKBSfH

LYLE
Does he know that

HOLLIS
Whats on your mind

LYLE
He doesnt belong on this mission
Responsible or not he blames himself
Hes too close to it
(beat)
And then theres his wife

HOLLIS
Its been two years since she died
Hes over it

were pulled off a well deserved leave
to be sent out to the middle of
nowhere and no ones even told us
why

WEIR
Ive been authorized to brief you
and the crew once we reach Neptune

MILLER
Until then do what youre told and
stay out of my way

Weir nods moves to an empty couch bearing his name written
on a piece of tape Peters watches him

First time in a grav couch

WEIR
Yes

She checks Weirs couch helps him climb in Weir keeps one
eye on Miller

And this is mission specialist Dr
William Weir We all know where were
going Dr Weir is going to tell us
why

Miller and the crew look at Weir waiting Weir clears his
throat

WEIR
What I am about to tell you is
considered code-black by the NSA

The crew look at each other they havent heard that ina
mission briefing before

JUSTIN
That means top-secret Cooper

COOPER
I heard it

WEIR
The USAC intercepted a radio
transmission from a decaying orbit
around Neptune The source has been
identified as the Event Horizon

STUNNED SILENCE Then everyone talks at once
STARCK
Thats impossible She was lost with

all hands what seven

JUSTIN
Seven years ago the reactor blew

PETERS
How can we salvage

SMITH
Let the dead rest man

COOPER
cancel our leave and send us out

on some bullshit mission

MILLER
EVERYBODY SHUT UP Let the man speak
In the quiet that follows

WEIR

What was made public about the Event
Horizon that she was a deep space
research vessel that its reactor
went critical that the ship blew
up None of that is true

(beat)
The Event Horizon was the culmination
of a secret government project to
create a spacecraft capable of faster-
than-light flight

The crew stares at Weir he has just dropped another bomb on
them

SMITH
You cant do that

STARCK
The law of relativity prohibits faster-
than-light travel

WEIR
Relativity yes We cant break the
law of relativity but we can go
around it The ship doesnt really
move faster than the speed of light
it creates a dimensional gateway
that allows the ship to
instantaneously jump from one point
in the universe to another light
years away

STARCK
How

WEIR

Well in laymans terms you use a
rotating magnetic field to focus a
narrow beam of gravitons these in
turn fold space-time consistent with
Weyl tensor dynamics until the space-
time curvature becomes infinitely
large and you have a singularity

COOPER
Laymens terms

Weir thinks of another way to explain it He rips a pin-up
from Smiths locker

SMITH
Hey
WEIR

Say this paper represents space-time
and you want to get from point A
here

(marks it on the photo

with a pen)
to point B here

(marks point B)
Now whats the shortest distance
between two points

The crew stares at him Starck decides to play

STARCK
A straight line

WEIR
Wrong The shortest distance between
two points

Weir folds the paper lining up point A over point B
THRUSTING his pen through both skewering the pin-up

WEIR

is zero Thats what the
singularity does it folds space so
that point A and point B coexist in
the same space and time After the
ship passes through this gateway
space returns to normal

(hands the ruined pin-

up back to Smith)
Its called a gravity drive

JUSTIN
How do you know all this

WEIR
I built it

Even Cooper is impressed

COOPER
I can see why they sent you along

JUSTIN
So if the ship didnt blow up what
happened

WEIR

It was the ships maiden voyage to
test the drive The Event Horizon
moved to safe distance using ion
thrusters They received the go-ahead
to activate the gravity drive

(beat)

then
And the ship vanished from all our
scopes No radar contact no enhanced
optical no radio contact of any
kind They disappeared without a
trace

(beat)
Until now

MILLER
Where has it been for the last seven
years

WEIR

Thats what were here to find out

from the bridges speakers STATIC and NOISE and underneath
all INHUMAN VOICES

The crew listen look at one another The recording ends
abruptly

SMITH
What the hell is that

PETERS
It doesnt sound like anything human

WEIR
Houston has passed the recording
through several filters and isolated
what appears to be a human voice

He activates a different file The resulting WAIL is more
human but no less terrifying a cry of despair The last
message from a drowning man

SMITH
Jesus
MILLER
What is that

DJ
It sounds like Latin

COOPER
Latin Who the fuck speaks Latin

STARCK
No one Its a dead language

DJ
Mostly dead

MILLER
What does it say

WEIR
NSA encryption specialists have
deciphered some of the message

Weir plays the HELLISH INCANTATION for a third time

WEIR
There liberatis me They
havent been able to translate the
rest its too distorted

DJ
Liberatis me Save me

COOPER
From what

MILLER
(to Weir)
Youre convinced the crew could still
be alive After seven years

WEIR
The Event Horizon only had life
support for eighteen months It seems
impossible but in light of the
transmission I have to think that
someone has managed to endure until
now

Affirmative The hulls intact
but theres no gravity and the thermal
units are off line Im showing deep
cold The crew couldnt survive unless
they were in stasis

STARCK
Theres not enough radiation to throw
off the scan Im picking up trace
life forms but I cant get a lock
on the location

WEIR
Could it be the crew If they were
in suspended animation wouldnt
that effect the scan

STARCK
If they were in stasis Id get a
location but these readings theyre
all over the ship It doesnt make
any sense

Cooper backs out allowing the inner airlock door to shut
ECHOING through the ship

INT LEWIS AND CLARK - UMBILICUS
Miller Peters and Justin float down the brightly lit
umbilicus into the Event Horizon all in EVA suits Justins
safety line trails out behind him
The OUTER AIRLOCK DOOR of the Event Horizon waits for them
INT LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE
Weir has taken over Justins station He watches the POV
monitors like a kid watching Christmas Smith and Starck
keep tabs over his shoulder
WEIR
Youve reached the outer airlock
door

INT LEWIS AND CLARK - UMBILICUS

Peters attaches a thumper -- a device using sound waves to
measure pressure -- to the inner airlock door

PETERS
Weve got pressure

MILLER
Clear and open on my mark Three
two one mark

Peters inserts a zero-G drill into the panel beside the door
The door slowly opens

CUT TO
INT EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

The immense corridor stretches away into darkness in both
directions Distantly spaced windows manifest as remote pools
of blue light amidst endless black adding to the vast sense
of scale

The light from their dual spotlights on the teams helmets
reflects off tiny ice crystals of frozen atmosphere They
are ants in a tomb built for giants

PETERS
Jesus its huge

MILLER
Ice crystals everywhere This place
is a deep freeze

WEIR (OS)

Youre in the central corridor It
connects the personnel areas to

Not a chance sir

INT EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

The group separates Justin kicks off from the wall shoots
down the corridor at immense speed

INT EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS

Miller and Peters move in the opposite direction They use
magnetic plates on their boots and gloves to cling to the
walls as they slowly make their way down the dark shaft
Their journey seems endless The darkness almost seems a
living thing as it surrounds them
INT EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS

Miller spots something at a coupling where two sections of
the corridor join

MILLER
Dr Weir whats this

Miller indicates a box nestled against the coupling The
universal symbol for explosives is on the cover

PETERS
(ahead at the next
coupling)
Heres another one Theyre all over
the place
WEIR (OS)
(radio)

Theyre explosive charges

MILLER
I can see that whatre they for

INT LEWIS AND CLARK - BRIDGE

WEIR
In an emergency the charges detonate
in series destroying the central
section and separating the personnel
areas from the rest of the ship
That way if the gravity drive
malfunctions the crew could use the
foredecks as a lifeboat

INT EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS
Peters and Miller keep moving

PETERS
That means they didnt abandon ship

MILLER
So where are they Starck any luck

with the bio-scan

Its possible that a burst of gravity
waves escaped from the Core
distorting space-time They could be
what hit the Lewis and Clark

COOPER
You been out there a long time Trying
to break my record

SMITH
Id rather spend the next twelve
hours Outside than another five
minutes in this can This ship is
bad It watches you

COOPER
What

SMITH
You heard me This ship its crazy
trying to go fastern light thats

Starck programs the sensor workstation She glances over at

Weir sitting at a computer terminal his face rapt as data
flashes by His lips move muttering to himself
STARCK
Why Dr Weir I think youre in love

WEIR
Hmmm Claire used to tell me I loved
the Event Horizon more than I loved
her I told her that wasnt true I
just knew the Event Horizon better
thats all

STARCK
Claire is your wife

WEIR
Yes

STARCK
It must be hard being so far away
from her

WEIR
Yes I miss her She died Two years
now

STARCK

Im sorry
Weir keeps his attention focused on the screen
WEIR
These things happen
(reacting to something
on the screen)
Wait a minute thats not right
He fingers fly across the keyboard double-checking the data

Miller leans over Weirs shoulder

MILLER
You have something Dr Weir

WEIR
The date

MILLER
What about it

WEIR
The Event Horizons computer thinks
its 2034

MILLER
Its 2041

WEIR

Exactly The ships internal clock
is off by seven years

STARCK
Maybe a power interruption crashed
the system

WEIR

No theres no evidence of a surge
or spike of any kind Its as if

time just stopped for seven years
MILLER

Explanation
WEIR

Intense gravitational fields effect
the passage of time its possible
(beat)
Black holes make sense on paper
its all math you see but as to
what really happened

followed by an inhuman HOWL of FEEDBACK like screaming

Obscured by static the image is blurred beyond comprehension

MILLER
What the hell is that Dr Weir

WEIR
I dont know

PETERS
I can run the image through a series

MILLER
Do it

Suddenly the lights fade out Dim emergency lighting snaps

PETERS
Whats happening

DJ
A power drain --

MILLER
We barely have enough power for life
support as it is if we cant stop
the drain were not gonna make it

The magnetic fields are holding
Maybe a short in the fail-safe
circuit Ill check it out

Miller assists Weir in removing bolts from an access panel
The panel falls away revealing a cramped duct leading into
the ships circuitry

Weir climbs into the duct Miller hands him a flashlight and
a toolkit

MILLER
We dont get the power back our

There you are

He uses a screwdriver to open up the module Reveals a series
of circuit boards One SPARKS Weir plucks the damaged chips
and starts running a by-pass

His flashlight flickers He bangs it against the duct wall
It grows dimmer Goes out

WEIR
Um Captain Miller I uh I seem to
have a problem with my light
A single DRIP of water in the darkness

Millers voice trails off as he looks towards the Core A
red glow reflects across his eyes He takes a few steps away

from the reactor He stares

at the BURNING MAN standing before the Core The deep
ROAR of its conflagration fills the containment

It slowly turns and raises its arm and points at Miller in
accusation

bulkhead leaving the wall blackened and burned with his
passing

Goddammit DJ it was not a
hallucination I saw a man he was
on fire And then he disappeared

STARCK
Maybe one of the original crew

MILLER
No It was someone else

STARCK
Who

MILLER
(ignoring the question)
Dr Weir you were right there you
must have heard something seen
something

WEIR
No I saw nothing

PETERS
I did

All heads turn to her

PETERS
About an hour ago In medical I saw
my son He was lying on one of the
examination tables and his legs
were
(she trails off)

WEIR
Isnt it possible that you were
traumatized by finding the body on
the bridge

PETERS
Ive seen bodies before This is
different

She falls silent unwilling to say more

MILLER
Peters is right Its like something
reaching into your mind Seeing your
thoughts and making them real Smith
did you or Cooper experience anything
unusual

Smith leaning against the doorway

SMITH
I didnt see anything and I dont
have to see anything This ship is
fucked

WEIR
Thank you for that scientific
analysis Mister Smith

SMITH
(exploding)
Hey You dont need to be a scientist
figure it out

MILLER
Smith

Weirs face is stone

SMITH
you break all the laws of physics
you think there wont be a price
You already killed the first crew

MILLER
Thats enough

DJ lays one hand on Smiths shoulder to calm him

Smith reacts violently turning on DJ shoving him back DJ
uses Smiths momentum to spin the pilot into the wall He
presses his scalpel just below Smiths ear

MILLER
DJ

DJ freezes The scalpel falls from his hands He releases
Smith

DJ
Im sorry I I dont know why I
did that
WEIR

Smith goes for Weir

SMITH
Hes fucking lying you know
something

Miller heads him off grabs him

MILLER
Thats it thats enough for one
day Smith I need you back on the

using your head you make a mistake
out there none of are getting home
you understand

Smith calms

SMITH
Sir

MILLER
Get outside go back to work Ill
join you shortly

Smith leaves

MILLER
Were a long way from home and were
in a bad place Lets not make it
worse If anyone has any constructive
suggestions now is the time

WEIR
I think I can stabilize the fields
around the singularity that should
prevent another power drain

MILLER
Do it

DJ
To conserve our oxygen we should
severely restrict our activity Anyone
who can should get some sleep

MILLER
I dont need sleep DJ I need
answers

Miller exits Starck follows

What is it Starck

STARCK
I ran the bio-scan with the DNARNA
filter The results were bio-readings
of indeterminate origin

MILLER

(simultaneous)
bio-readings of indeterminate
origin dont you have anything

useful to tell me

STARCK
Ive got a theory

Miller stops

MILLER
Go ahead

STARCK
There was a another surge in the bio-
readings right before you you saw

what you saw We picked up a similar
readings right before the Clarke was
damaged What if there were a
connection between the two The
gravity waves the hallucination
all part of an defensive reaction
like an immune system

MILLER
I dont need to hear this

She rushes to follow

Miller and Starck enter the Airlock Bay

STARCK
Youve got to listen

MILLER
To what What are you saying This
ship is alive
STARCK
I didnt say that I said the bio-
readings correspond to what happened
to you the ship is reacting to us

MILLER
Were hanging on by our fingernails
and youre giving me bullshit
stories

She grabs him by the arm

STARCK
Its not bullshit its the only
conclusion the data supports

MILLER
Starck do you know how crazy that
sounds Its impossible

STARCK
I know that

Beat Miller allows himself to relax

MILLER
If you knew it was impossible then
whyd you waste my time

STARCK
I thought you wanted an answer And
thats the only one I have

Miller pulls an EVA suit from the wall starts putting it
on

MILLER
What I want is to survive the next
ten hours

STARCK

his arm in a wrist-lock He turns on her his face furious

from Decatur Georgia He got caught
when the pressure doors sealed one
closed on his arm Severed it at the
wrist The pain of that must have
been He passed out and

Miller trails off DJ waits patiently Finally

I I tried to go back for him to
save him but I couldnt get to him
in time The fire Have you ever
seen fire in zero-gravity Its like
a liquid it slides over everything
It was like a wave breaking over
him a wave of fire And then he was
gone

It knows our secrets It knows what
were afraid of

His hand closes on the scrubber and he swings it across Weirs
head Weir reels back stunned

Miller gets to his feet

MILLER
You cant have them

He hits Weir again HARD Blood gushes from Weirs skull
filling the runes on his face

Weir staggers Miller attacks Again and again and again

This time Weir is ready He catches the scrubber and tears
it from Millers grasp SMASHES Miller to the floor with a
single blow Miller GROANS

WEIR

older I watched the Beginning and I
will see the End I am the dark behind
the stars I am the dark inside you

Miller gets to all fours trying to get up

MILLER

Weir kicks Miller savagely Miller slides through the coolant
comes to rest beneath a walkway He attempts to rise
collapses back into the sludge

Weir slowly stalks towards him

WEIR
There is no Devil There is no God
There is only NOTHING

MILLER
Youre lying

WEIR
Im not asking you to believe me
Youll see for yourself and so
will your crew Youre all coming
with me

MILLER
Starck Cooper

Weirs grotesque face is inches from his He reaches down
and pulls Miller from the dripping ooze

WEIR

fist

triumph)

EXT EVENT HORIZON - MODEL

A small silent EXPLOSION blossoms in the aft section of the
ship

INT EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - NO AIRLOCKS
-followed frames later by a sequence of DETONATIONS that
rip the Main Access Corridor apart and propel the foredecks
away from the containment section

INT EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR (ROLLOVER SET)

The EXPLOSION knocks Starck and Cooper down They hold on
tightly as

EXT NEPTUNE - MODEL

Waves of distortion ripple over the Event Horizons
containment section
A dark sphere of energy spreads out from the containment as
the gateway opens A BLACK HOLE

The black hole begins to shrink imploding As it collapses
it sucks Neptunes blue clouds with it creating a TITANIC
WHIRLPOOL with the black hole at its center

The SHRIEKING winds carry the foredecks back towards the
whirlpool towards the black hole

INT EVENT HORIZON - CORRIDOR (ROLLOVER SET)

Cooper and Starck slide across the floor as the deck tips at
a terrific angle

EXT NEPTUNE - MODEL
The foredecks teeter on the edge of oblivion

The black hole collapses utterly vanishing to a point An
enormous SHOCKWAVE rips out from the point of implosion

The foredecks ride the wave away from the implosion and out
of Neptunes atmosphere to safety

The VIBRATIONS subside Cooper and Starck stagger to their
feet Look out the window
