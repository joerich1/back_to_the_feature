AcT 1

SEQ 100 - PRELOGUE

EXT DYSTOPIC KUMANDRA - DAY

A LONE RIDER on a LARGE WHEEL tears through a harsh-looking
landscape

She passes by stone statues and ruins overgrown with vines
and plants

Whatever this place is it’s not okay

RAYA (VO)
I know what you’re thinking A lone
rider a dystopian world a land
that’s gone to waste - how did this
world get so broken Well that all
began 500 years ago

The camera pulls high into the air showing an aerial shot of
Kumandra

SEQ 110 - PROLOGUE

MONTAGE

Stylistically the following sequence is performed using
Southeast Asian-inspired puppetry

It begins with shots of the land its people and the lush
river that connects them all

RAYA (VO)
Kumandra This is what we used to
be when our land was whole and we
lived harmoniously alongside
dragons - magical creatures who
brought us water and rain and
peace

DRAGONS leap out of the river like dolphins

RAYA (VO)
It was paradise

A beautiful shot of Kumandran people and dragons living
harmoniously
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 2

RAYA (VO)
But then the druun came - a
mindless plague that spread like
wildfire - multiplying as they
consumed life and turned everyone
they touched into stone

The smoke-like DRUUN turns someone into stone by floating
over them As it does the Druun multiplies into two

A war between the Druun and the Dragons ensue
RAYA (VO)
The dragons fought for us the best
they could but it wasn’t enough

Druun turn dragons and people into stone by the dozens

Amid the chaos we find SISU a majestic blue Dragon who
climbs to the highest point in Kumandra

RAYA (VO)
That’s when the mighty Sisudatu
the last dragon concentrated all
her magic into a gem and

She centers all her magic and -

RAYA (VO)
-- blasted the druun away

A MAGICAL EXPLOSION WIPES AWAY THE DRUUN and returns everyone
back to normal

RAYA (VO)
Everyone that was turned to stone
came back except the dragons

We see a stone dragon graveyard

RAYA (VO)
All that was left of Sisu was her
gem

Where Sisu stood there’s now a glowing Dragon Gem

RAYA (VO)
It should have been this big
inspirational moment where humanity
united over her sacrifice but
instead - people being people -
they all fought to possess the last
remnant of dragon magic
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 3

We see the map of Kumandra split up

RAYA (VO)
Borders were drawn Kumandra
divided We all became enemies And
the gem had to be hidden

We see a palace erected around the gem

RAYA (VO)
But that’s not how the world broke
That didn’t truly happen until 500
years later when I came into the
story

SEQ 120 - YOUNG RAYA

INT DARK ROOM - NIGHT

DRIVING DRUM MUSIC takes us through QUICK FLASHES of

- a WEAPONS closet being opened

- gloved hands reaching for fighting sticks

- a mask being tied on

REVEAL A young warrior headed out into the night But then
is stopped when she passes a METAL CUFF Is it a weapon A
piece of armor

Nope it’s a cute HAIR TIE

LIGHTNING FLASHES casting light on our warrior revealing
it’s YOUNG RAYA

TITLE CARD RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON

EXT HEART PALACE GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS
Raya runs over the rooftops leaping from one building to the

next She does it with stealth athleticism and most
importantly STYLE

INT DRAGON TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS

She sneaks into the tunnel hallways of the ancient Dragon
Temple Her hands glide over ornate wall carvings of Dragons
then abruptly pauses Something’s not right There’s a
strange GROOVE in it
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 4

Raya discovers a loose stone on the pathway she compresses
it - suddenly a NET swoops down - but Raya avoids it with
ease

YOUNG RAYA
(humored)
Looks like someone’s trying to be
clever

She reaches into her satchel and pulls out what looks like a
SMALL ARMORED BALL She taps on it

The ball opens revealing THE CUTEST FURRY FACE YOU HAVE EVER
SEEN This is TUK-TUK half pill-bug half puppy

YOUNG RAYA (CONTD)
Alright Tuk-Tuk let’s show ’em
what clever really looks like

TUK-TUK turns back into a ball and rolls down the chamber
hallway triggering BOOBY TRAPS swinging nets spring up
designed to trap intruders But Tuk-Tuk rolls under the nets
unscathed

Tuk-Tuk unfurls and walks down the hallway but gets
distracted by a passing BUG

YOUNG RAYA (CONTD)
Tuk-Tuk Come on Focus

Tuk-Tuk obliges and stays on task

YOUNG RAYA (CONTD)
Thank you

Raya crawls safely under the nets behind Tuk-Tuk
YOUNG RAYA (CONTD)
Hey bud That was awesome Gimme

some shell

Tuk-Tuk tries to high-five her but ends up rolling over onto
his back

YOUNG RAYA (CONTD)
(flips Tuk-Tuk back over)
I gotcha

Raya comes to a large circular door and unlocks it

SEQ 123 - RITE OF PASSAGE
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 5

INT CHAMBER OF THE DRAGON GEM - CONTINUOUS

Raya takes off her shoes and leaves them at the doorway as
she steps into the inner chamber of the temple

GLOWING FLOWERS light the way as underfoot a stream of
water flows AGAINST GRAVITY up some steps Raya looks around
sensing the MAGIC of the place She steps into the open room
to see

THE DRAGON GEM

It floats above a small pond in the middle of the room It’s
a multi-faceted glowing orb emanating a MAGIC ENERGY that’s
reflected in the glowing flowers and otherworldly light
around it Stepping stones lead across the pond towards the
Gem

Young Raya heads for the Gem then pauses -

YOUNG RAYA
(realizes)
Wait a second this feels too

easy

She turns to see A GOLDEN MASKED WARRIOR standing between her
and the Gem

YOUNG RAYA (CONTD)
(humored)
Chief Benja Look I know it’s your
job to try and stop me but you
wont

BENJA
Don’t mistake spirit for skill
young one I promise you will not
set foot on the Dragon Gem’s inner
circle Not even a toe

YOUNG RAYA
You might want to take out that
blade You’re gonna need it

BENJA
Not today

The Masked Warrior detaches his sword from his belt but
doesn’t remove it from its sheathe

Raya attacks THEY FIGHT - it’s fun athletic

Theyre both highly skilled but Benja is clearly the
superior fighter He disarms her Raya and puts her on point
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 6

With the tip of his sheathed sword inches away from her face
he then

BENJA (CONTD)
BOOP

- “boops” her on the nose with it
He removes his mask revealing BENJA Raya’s father

BENJA (CONTD)
Like I said not one foot on the
inner circle You lost Raya

YOUNG RAYA
(smug)
Did I

The Masked Warrior looks down to see that Raya has her toe
touching the Gem’s inner circle platform

BENJA
(with seeming pride)
Raya
(but in reality)
- I probably should have said two
feet

YOUNG RAYA
Hey Don’t beat yourself up too
much Chief Benja You gave it your
best

BENJA
I won’t And it’s either father or
ba to you
(smiles)
You did good dewdrop
(with great affection)
You passed the test

He gestures for her to step onto the Gem’s circle Raya takes
a breath and does - it’s a moment she’s been working towards
her whole life

Raya is transfixed by the Gem’s brilliance Her cockiness
falls away as she’s caught up in its magic

YOUNG RAYA
Wow The spirit of Sisu

Benja smiles - he’s been waiting for this moment his whole
life too
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 7

He approaches the Gem and kneels Raya follows suit She
looks entranced at the GLOWING WATER DROPLETS spiraling
around and above the Gem

BENJA
For generations our family has
sworn to protect the gem Today
you will join that legacy

Raya’s bows as Benja scoops up water with his hands and pours
it on her It’s a sacred intimate ceremony

As the water trickles down her face to Raya’s amazement the
droplets start to GLOW and float all around her joining the
droplets encircling the Gem

BENJA (CONTD)
Raya Princess of Heart my
daughter You are now a Guardian of
the Dragon Gem

Benja looks at his daughter with pride as Raya accepts this
new responsibility He puts an arm around her as she leans

her head on his shoulder This is everything she’s ever
wanted

SEQ 126 - DAD’S WISDOM

EXT HEART PALACE - DAY
A MONTAGE of life in Heart

Cranes elegantly glide above Heart’s temple Small
fantastical critters scurry across branches A hand
delicately places flowers into a spirit house

Life here is peaceful and good

INT PALACE HALLWAY - DAY

Benja and Raya walk down the palace hallways Raya walks a
few steps ahead of him throwing strikes and kicks swept up
in an imaginary fight

BENJA
Well someone’s excited

YOUNG RAYA
Anyone hoping to steal the dragon
gem now has to face the fury of the
TWO baddest blades in all the
lands
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 8

BENJA
(confidentially)
I’m glad you feel prepared
dewdrop because I have something
important to tell you - the other
lands they’re on their way here
as we speak

YOUNG RAYA
They are

Benja nods

YOUNG RAYA (CONTD)
Okay OKAY we can do this I’m
ready I know exactly how we’1ll
stop them

BENJA
(unconvinced)
Really Tell me what you know about
the other lands

IMAGES SLAM ONTO SCREEN

Zoom into the desert region of Kumandra and a TAIL MERCENARY
sharpening a sharp blade

YOUNG RAYA (VO)
First Tail A sweltering desert
with sneaky mercenaries who fight
dirty

The Tail Mercenary slashes at camera

Zoom into the port-city of Kumandra and a Talon Merchant
juggling fruit

YOUNG RAYA (VO)
Second Talon A floating market
famous for fast deals and fighters
with even faster hands

A TALON MERCHANT tosses the fruit and slices them in the air
with a pair of knives

On the snow-covered mountains of Spine we see an army of
LARGE BARBARIANS

YOUNG RAYA (VO)
Third Spine A frigid bamboo
forest guarded by exceptionally
large warriors and their giant
axes
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim

A shot of the WARRIORS OF FANG
YOUNG RAYA (VO)
Fourth Fang our fiercest enemy A
nation protected by angry
assassins and their even angrier
cats
Reveal the angry cat in one of their arms

CATS (VOICED BY RAYA)
Hisss

The cat swipes at camera as

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Back to reality Tuk-Tuk hisses like the cat to compliment

Raya’s story as
Raya and Benja enter the kitchen
YOUNG RAYA
Okay so we’re gonna need
crossbows And catapults Ooo what
about flaming catapults

Benja walks over to a soup pot

BENJA
(adds ingredients)
Or how about - Shrimp paste from

Tail lemongrass from Talon Bamboo
shoots from Spine chilis from
Fang and palm sugar from Heart

YOUNG RAYA
(confused)
Well poison them

BENJA
No we’re not going poison them and
we’re not going to fight them
We’re going to share a meal with
them

YOUNG RAYA
Wait what

BENJA
I invited them

Benja hands her a bowl of soup
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 10

YOUNG RAYA
But they’re our enemies

BENJA
They’re only our enemies because
they think the dragon gem magically
brings us prosperity

YOUNG RAYA
That’s ridiculous It doesn’t do
that

BENJA

They assume it does just like we
assume things about them

(offers a bowl of soup)

Raya there’s a reason why each
land is named after a part of the
dragon We were once unified
harmoniously as one Kumandra

YOUNG RAYA
That’s ancient history ba

BENJA
But it doesn’t have to be Listen
if we don’t stop and learn to trust
one another again it’s only a
matter of time before we tear each
other apart This isn’t the world I
want you to live in

Raya nods
BENJA (CONTD)
I believe that we can be Kumandra

again But someone has to take the
first step Trust me

SEQ 130 - BUILDING BRIDGES

EXT BRIDGE - NEW DAY

Raya and Benja stare at an armada of different clans We see
the flags and unamused faces of the five different nations

YOUNG RAYA
(whispers )
Thing’s look a little tense ba
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 11

BENJA
Don’t worry I’m gonna open with a
joke

YOUNG RAYA

Please don’t

BENJA
I’m kidding I’m kidding

Benja steps forward

BENJA (CONTD)
People of Tail Talon Spine and
Fang welcome to Heart For far too
long we have been enemies But
today is a new day Today we can
be Kumandra once more

Benja gestures inviting them to cross the bridge but no one
moves

TAIL CHIEF
(extra-paranoid)
Nice speech Chief Benja but why’d
you really bring us here Are you
gonna rob us

DANG HAI (CHIEF OF TALON)
(slightly drunk)
Why would he need to rob us The
land of Heart already has
everything

SPINE CHIEF
It’s easy to pontificate on
Kumandra when you hold the
mightiest weapon in all the lands

BENJA
The gem’s not a weapon it’s a
sacred relic

Raya looks around and sees all the angry voices shouting from
the crowds

Her eyes catch NAMAARI’s (also 12 the only other kid in this
army of angry adults)

They share a smile as all the adults argue away

Raya makes a decision and steps forward gives a respectful
bow before speaking
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 12

YOUNG RAYA
I have something to say

The crowds hushes

YOUNG RAYA (CONTD)
Who’s hungry

No one in the crowd responds except for one hand raises a
LANKY SPINE WARRIOR from the congregation of Spine His
fellow warriors eye-shame him into lowering it

Namaari giggles at him She looks up at her mother VIRANA
(Queen of Fang) asking for permission to approach

VIRANA
(whispers )
Go ahead It’s alright

Namaari walks to Raya

YOUNG NAMAARI
I’m Namaari Of Fang

YOUNG RAYA
Hi Namaari I’m Raya

Raya notices Namaari’s necklace

YOUNG RAYA (CONTD)
Is that Sisu
(embarrassed)
Sorry I might be a little bit of a
dragon nerd

YOUNG NAMAARI
Hey I’m the one wearing the Sisu
fan-necklace

The girls are clearly cut from the same cloth Raya invites
Namaari into the palace

YOUNG RAYA
Come on Have you eaten yet

The two girls follow each other over the bridge into the
palace as Benja smiles proud of his daughter

The sight of these two girls connecting lowers everyone’s
defenses and the rest of the clans too cross the bridge

SEQ 132 - DRAGON NERDS

RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 13

INT PALACE - NIGHT

The interior of the palace It’s crowded No one’s talking
Everyone’s giving each other some major side-eye

Focus shifts to Young Raya and Namaari who are hanging out at
the edge of the room Tuk Tuk reaches to nibble at a skewer
of food just as Raya picks it up

YOUNG RAYA
(mid-laugh)
Seriously Your mom actually said
that Awkward

Namaari laughs in acknowledgment

YOUNG RAYA (CONTD)
Okay next question - hand-to-hand
or swords

YOUNG NAMAARTI
(duh)
Blades all day

YOUNG RAYA
Right

Kumandran fist-bump

YOUNG NAMAARTI
Okay dressy or casual

YOUNG RAYA
Only a monster would choose to wear
this outfit on the regular

Raya looks around for inspiration for her next question she
sees their food

YOUNG RAYA (CONTD)
Rice or stew

Namaari however goes silent

YOUNG RAYA (CONTD)
I didn’t think that’d stump you

YOUNG NAMAARI
This is actually one of the first
times I’ve had rice in a while

YOUNG RAYA
Really
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 14

YOUNG NAMAARI
Fang may look nice on the outside
but we have some pretty big holes
on the inside

YOUNG RAYA
Oh

YOUNG NAMAARI
Sorry didn’t mean to bring it
down So where were we We both
have single parents who are
terrible at telling jokes we’re
both warrior-women who despise
uncomfortable formal wear -

YOUNG RAYA
- AND we’re both Sisu super fans

YOUNG NAMAARI
(hushed)
You know Fang legend says she’s
still out there

YOUNG RAYA
Sisu You’re kidding right

YOUNG NAMAARI
Wanna see something

Young Namaari looks around No one is paying attention to
them She pulls out a scroll She handles it gently with
reverence

YOUNG RAYA
(in awe)
Are you supposed to have that

YOUNG NAMAARI
(duh)
No

Namaari opens the scroll revealing an intricate design of
Sisu and the Druun

YOUNG NAMAARI (CONTD)
According to this after the Mighty
Sisu blasted away all the druun
she fell into the water and floated
downstream Legends say she’s now
sleeping at the river’s end

Tuk Tuk crawls onto the scroll and looks at the design with
the girls
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 15

YOUNG RAYA
But which river There’s like
hundreds

YOUNG NAMAART
I don’t know But if we could find
it could you imagine A dragon
back in the world Things could be
so much better

YOUNG RAYA
(looks at her dad)
Yeah maybe we really could be
Kumandra again

Namaari makes a decision She takes off her necklace and
hands it to Raya

YOUNG NAMAART
Here

YOUNG RAYA
Whoa Really

YOUNG NAMAARI
From one dragon nerd to another

Raya looks at the pendant and back at Namaari gets an idea
YOUNG RAYA
Hey Come with me dep la I wanna
show you something
The girls stand to leave Tuk-Tuk takes a bite of food then
follows Raya

SEQ 150 - BETRAYED

INT DRAGON TEMPLE - NIGHT
Young Raya and Namaari enter the inner chamber
Tuk-Tuk waits by the entrance watching them
YOUNG NAMAARTI
(sees the gem in awe)

The spirit of Sisu I can feel it

Raya smiles happy she has a pal to share this with
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 16

YOUNG RAYA
It’s the last bit of dragon magic
left in the whole world
YOUNG NAMAARTI
I see why Heart guards it so
closely Thank you dep la Youve
been very helpful
Namaari suddenly strikes Raya sending her to the ground
She looks on in shock at Namaari
YOUNG NAMAARI (CONTD)
In a different world maybe we
coulda been friends But I have to
do what’s right for Fang

Namaari goes for the Gem but Raya leaps in front of her
They start fighting

Seeing that Raya’s in trouble Tuk-Tuk rolls in to help

He bumps into Namaari’s ankle but she scoots him away Tuk-
Tuk shakes it off angry

This distracts Namaari just long enough for Raya to strike
knocking her to the ground

However Namaari isn’t worried at all Instead she smiles and
shoots a firework up through the temple opening
INT PALACE - DAY
Benja is speaking to VIRANA the Fang Queen
BENJA
Chief Virana I’m so glad Fang
accepted our invitation

The firework explodes in the night sky Everyone looks up

The congregation of Fang immediately begins moving out
towards the Gem temple

Benja looks back to the Fang Queen to discover she’s gone

INT DRAGON TEMPLE - NIGHT

As Namaari and Raya continue to fight
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 17

YOUNG RAYA
There is no way youre taking
Sisu’s Gem
Namaari steps away from Raya towards the chamber doors

YOUNG NAMAART
Sorry It’s Fang’s now

Suddenly the room fills up with Fang soldiers

Raya steps back she’s the only thing between Fang and the
gem

Tuk-Tuk climbs up on Raya’s shoulder frightened
Raya bravely squares up against the Fang forces until -

SWOOSH Benja repels into the room from above and quickly
dispatches a dozen different adversaries His sword turns

into acool grappling whip which he uses to drive everyone
back
BENJA

You will not set foot on the Dragon
Gem’s inner circle

A giant smile crosses Raya’s face Her dad is indeed the
baddest blade in all of Kumandra

But then

FEMALE SPINE WARRIOR (0S)
What’s going on

SPINE CHIEF (0S)
What is this

The other armies from Tail Talon and Spine begin to shuffle
into the room

Suddenly they all stop and see the gem for the first time
They’re in awe

FEMALE SPINE WARRIOR
Fang’s making a play for the Gem

SPINE CHIEF
No Spine should have the gem

TAIL CHIEF
Not if we get to it first

Everyone pulls out their weapons
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 18

This is going to be a blood bath

Benja sees Raya in the reflection of his sword as she raises
her fists to help defend the Gem He makes a decision

BENJA
Listen to me

Everyone has their weapons raised -
BENJA (CONTD)

We have a choice We can tear each
other apart or we can come
together and build a better world
It’s not too late I still believe
we can be Kumandra again

Benja sheathes his sword

Did it work

Suddenly an arrow strikes Benja in the leg As he sinks
everyone rushes in

YOUNG RAYA
Ba

Raya runs to Benja’s side as
Hands grabs onto the gem it gets tossed around until -

KRSHH The Gem crashes to the ground breaking into five

pieces

But before anyone can react - BOOM

The ground shakes the water in the chamber recedes the
floor opens up

From the broken Earth A DRUUN emerges

BENJA
Druun

The ARCHER shoots an arrow at the creature but it goes right
through the Druun leaving him unscathed The Druun
immediately turns the archer to stone then duplicates

The Druun turns toward Benja and Raya Benja quickly rushes
to grab one of the gem pieces and holds it up repelling
the Druun back momentarily

There’s a mad scramble as the other four gem pieces get
snatched up
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 19

YOUNG RAYA
No

Raya grabs her father pulling him out of the fray

YOUNG RAYA (CONTD)
(runs up)
Ba Come on We have to go

A Druun pursues after them but touches water and recoils

BENJA
(realizing)
They’re repelled by water
(to everyone)
Hurry Get to the river

SEQ 160 - BROKEN HEART

EXT HEART BRIDGE - DAY

Heart is plunged into chaos with people fleeing Raya escapes
with Benja and Tuk-Tuk over the bridge But it’s slow going --
Benja is badly hurt and they’re constantly shoved aside by
others trying to save themselves

Benja’s leg gives out from under him and he falls
YOUNG RAYA
Ba Get up Come on Please we

He looks ahead the distance is too far for him to go
The bridge SHAKES again Benja sees a Druun approaching
YOUNG RAYA (CONTD)

Benja hands Raya the gem He pulls her in close then kisses
her on the forehead

BENJA (CONTD)

YOUNG RAYA

Benja pushes Raya off the bridge into the water just as

YOUNG RAYA (CONTD)

As the current carries her away Raya watches her father’s
unmoving silhouette on the bridge

Tuk-Tuk turns back to the cliffside
RAYA (CONTD)
Good boy You’re so easily

Just then a DRUUN attacks
Raya and Tuk-Tuk fall back Raya scrambles for her satchel

Just as the Druun closes in Raya pulls out her gem shard and
holds it up scaring the Druun off

She turns around to find Tuk-Tuk immobile on his back
looking at her helplessly

follow but can’t fit into the opening

TUK-TUK

on the ground

The trickle leads her to a sheer wall of loose rock and
debris where the water-stream disappears into a hole
underneath it

There’s no way for Raya to get to the other side

Raya rummages around her satchel pulls out a bowl She
places it on the ground and fills it with rice

She holds the dragon pendant in her hands

She takes a deep breath
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 23

RAYA (CONTD)
(deep breath)
Okay Here goes everything

Raya raises a vial of water to her head and bows She pours
the water over the pendant in the bowl

RAYA (CONTD)
(chants with reverence)
Suva de dra sim
Mandra de dra lim
Bavaa de dra Tomben

She pours the last of the water from the bottle and raises
the bottle to her head again

Raya sits in anticipated silence but nothing seems to
happen

However unbeknownst to her the stream behind her begins to
flow backwards Water droplets rise out of the stream and
swirl in the air

Tuk-Tuk sees this from the outside entrance as he drinks
from a puddle Tuk-Tuk starts “barking” to get Raya’s
attention

RAYA (
(to Tuk Tuk)
I know buddy I

CONTD)
haven’t forgot -

Raya now sees the floating water droplets which now are
coming together to magically form SISU

SISU
(inside a dust cloud)
Where am I Pengu Amba Pranee
Are ya here

Seeing Sisu’s silhouette Raya bows
RAYA
(bowing)
Oh Mighty Sisu -

SISU

Sisu turns her mighty tail swings out and clobbers the
bowing Raya

Sisu steps out of the dust-cloud We finally see her in her
mighty glory
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 24

SISU (CONTD)
Hello Hello

under her perhaps tangled up in her own cape

SISU

RAYA

SISU
Also you broke the gem

RAYA
I still have a big chunk of it
though
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 26

SISU
Is that supposed to make me feel
better If you lost a puppy and I
said “Well we still have a big
chunk of it” would that make you
feel better

RAYA
Can’t you just make another one

SISU
No I can’t just make another one

RAYA
But you’re a dragon

SISU
I’m gonna be real with you
alright I’m not like the best
dragon You know

RAYA
But you saved the world

SISU
I did do that That’s true But
have you ever done like a group
project but there’s like that one
kid who didn’t pitch in as much but
still ended up with the same grade
Yeah I wasn’t the one who
actually made the gem I just
turned it in

Sisu picks up the gem shard and immediately starts glowing

RAYA
Whoa you’re glowing

SISU
Oh thank you I use aloe and river
slime to maintain my--

RAYA
No no-- look

Sisu looks at herself
SISU

magic

RAYA

RAYA
(processing)
Wait wait you touched this gem
piece and it gave you powers You
know what this means right

SISU

the gem’s magic And that means you
can still use it to save the world

Once the dust settles a single Serlot returns into frame A
hand reaches down to pick up a shiny object in the sand -
Raya’s hairpin
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 28

REVEAL Teenage NAMAARI (taller stronger angrier) She is
with four other Fang Soldiers

WAHN
Princess Namaari the Tail-lands
are infested with Druun Benja’s
daughter is as good as stone out
here Retrieving some useless
dragon scroll isn’t worth the risk

Namaari drops Wahn with a leg sweep
NAMAART
Anyone else want to question why
were out here

Assembled group is speechless

The Serlot army charges forward following Tuk-Tuk’s tracks
to the wrecked ship

It looks like Raya is gonna get caught however

In the background the silhouette of Raya and Sisu ride away
on Tuk-Tuk in the distance

Okay so here’s the sitch -

Raya’s stands in front of an impressive structure that’s now
the Tail Chief’s home

CU on Sisu’s face

SISU
Wow so many questions First one -
Why am I wearing this

Pull back to reveal Sisu dressed exactly like Raya

RAYA
Well we don’t want to attract
attention

Raya and Sisu look up at the old Tail Ruins

SISU
(looks at the hat)
Oh you definitely chose the right
hat for that
(walks forward)
So what makes you think the Tail
Chiefs here

Sisu hits a trip wire a spiky tree-trunk falls in her
direction

Raya dives pushes Sisu out of the way as the tree trunk
crashes down where she once stood

RAYA
Because this place didn’t just
boobytrap itself
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 30

INT THE TAIL DRAGON TEMPLE - DAY
Raya and Sisu carefully work their way through the temple

SISU
This doesn’t make sense None of
this would stop a druun

RAYA
It’s not to stop druun It’s to
stop people

SISU
Hm

They look down hallway and see an intricate array of trip-
lines Raya carefully works her way through it

She looks back at Sisu who quickly and smoothly flies through
the obstacle course without any problem Sisu shoots Raya a
smile

Raya’s blown away by what she’s just seen

SISU (CONTD)
What Why are you looking at me
like that

RAYA
Uh nothing Just not used to
seeing dragons

SISU
Impressed huh Wait till you see
my backstroke I’m wicked when I
hit that liquid I got water-skills
that kill I slaughter when I hit
the water I’m like really good
at swimming Through rhyme I was
trying to make that I was a
really good swimmer I’m a good
swimmer Is basically what I’m
saying

RAYA
Okay we need to keep going

Raya and Sisu round another dark corner
SISU

(loudly scaring Raya)
Oh no
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 31

RAYA
(concerned)
What What is it

SISU
We forgot to bring a gift for the
Tail Chief

RAYA
I’m sorry a gift

SISU
Yeah A gift says “you can trust
me can I trust you”
A bug falls on Sisu’s nose
SISU (CONTD)
Aw hey there little fella
Oh this beetle’s got a booty

RAYA
Careful It’s a Toot N Boom

SISU
Why is it called a--

Bug farts
Raya tackles Sisu as it explodes

SISU (CONTD)
Got it Noted Makes sense

Raya looks up and sees a hallway full of bugs
SISU (CONTD)
You have to admit though these bug

booties are kinda cute

They inch their way through

INT TAIL RUINS INMOST CHAMBER - MOMENTS LATER

Raya and Sisu enter a chamber There they find a floating
platform with a hollowed out tree at the center Inside it is
a skeleton holding a gem shard

RAYA
Id say we found the Tail Chief

SISU
What happened to her
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 32

RAYA
From the looks of it she was
hoarding the gem and became a
victim of her own traps

SISU
Well you got to admire her
commitment

They look at the missing bridge

RAYA
Okay hold on

Sisu grabs Raya’s shoulders

Raya uses her sword to swing them over to the other side but
suddenly they stop mid-swing They both look back and they
see that’s Sisu’s hind-legs haven’t left the ledge

SISU
Oh we were doing a jumpy thing So
sorry My bad I get it now I’m
with it

Sisu jumps and propels them to the other side
They land on the other side
Sisu reaches for the gem

RAYA
Sisu Don’t

Raya points out the trip wire that runs from the skeleton to
several pit-doors on the ceiling

Raya examines the booby-trap and does an “Indiana Jones”
style switch off to get the gem without triggering the traps
It’s tense

RAYA (CONTD)
Phew
(hands Sisu the gem)
Two down three to go

The gem lands in Sisu’s hand and suddenly - poof - she’s a
person

SISU-HUMAN
I just shape-changed Into people

RAYA
Dragons can do that
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 33

SISU-HUMAN
This was my sister Pranee’s thing

Sisu marches around weirdly

SISU-HUMAN (CONTD)
(plays around)

Look at my people arms and my
people face Look at how close my
butt is to my head Now that you
don’t have to hide me getting the
rest of the gems is gonna be a
breeze

RAYA
Yeah well this one was easy but
the rest of them are being held by
a bunch of no-good binturis

NAMAARI (0S)
Binturi That’s not a very nice way
to describe an old friend

Raya looks over to the entrance way and finds Namaari and her
soldiers standing there

RAYA
Namaari

NAMAART
What’s dripping dep la Oh I see
you finally made a new friend And
here I was worried you were gonna
end up becoming a cat lady Like

Namaari’s Serlots (Felines of Unusual Size) stroll into the

chamber
SISU-HUMAN
Something tells me you’re not
besties
NAMAARTI
Stealing dragon gem pieces are we
Why
RAYA

What can I say Bling is my thing
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 34

NAMAARTI
I gotta admit Raya - until a few
months ago I thought you were
stone but then someone stole
Fang’s dragon scroll -

RAYA
Oh is that why you’re chasing me
And here I thought it was because
you missed me

Raya throws back Namaari her dragon scroll Namaari catches
it face still looks severe

NAMAARTI
(picks it up)
Are you really looking for Sisu
What are you Twelve

RAYA
I actually was looking for Sisu
Ooh and guess what I found her
Sisu looks at Raya are you serious

Namaari can’t hide the fact that she’s moved Really

RAYA (CONTD)
Say hi Sisu

SISU-HUMAN
HI It’s very nice to meet you And
I love your hair - and your
cats’ hair

NAMAARTI
(unamused)
Take them
Namaari’s people raise their crossbows
Raya quickly reacts kicks the trip wire Traps go off The
room begins to fill with sand A ton of it dumps directly on
Namaari and her feline army

Raya scoops up Sisu and swings her over to the other side

RAYA
Run

Sisu tries to run but with four legs

RAYA (CONTD)
Not like that Two legs
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 35
SISU-HUMAN

SISU-HUMAN
Who was that girl

RAYA

backstabbing binturi that broke the
world

Sisu looks back
SISU-HUMAN
Wow those cats are really fast

Raya looks back and sees that Namaari and her soldiers are
all now chasing them with their Serlots
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 36

Raya looks ahead and notices a boat docked in a port An idea
crosses her mind

RAYA
What do cats and Druun have in
common

SISU-HUMAN
(guessing)
Um they have no souls

RAYA
(correction)
AND they both hate water

SISU-HUMAN

They leap into the water

Frustrated at being outmaneuvered Namaari reroutes her
soldiers in pursuit

Lock” over there What are you

Boun bangs on the pots and pans to make a beat

Raya awkwardly dances to cover her talking to Sisu off the
side of the ship

RAYA

over a dragon gem Can you imagine
what they’d do over an actual
dragon Look we need you to make
this all work

RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 4l

SISU-HUMAN
(loudly)
Why would he poison us

BOUN
(offended)

RAYA
First to get my jade purse

Tuk-Tuk

BOUN

(clearly unnerved)
This is why I never leave the boat

Raya clocks Boun’s words He might be verbose but he’s just
a kid

RAYA
You’re a smart kid

BOUN
What are druun anyways

SISU-HUMAN
A plague born from human discord
they’ve always been here - waiting
for a moment of weakness to attack
They’re like the opposite of
dragons instead of bringing water
and life to the world they’re like
a relentless fire that consumes
everything in its wake until
there’s nothing left except ash and
stone

BOUN
They took my family

Sisu takes flowers walks to the edge of the boat and drops
petals into the river

SISU-HUMAN
They took mine too

Boun joins Sisu takes some flowers and does the same

Raya clocks Boun’s sadness She walks over joins and casts
one single flower into the river for her dad

It’s a solemn yet unifying moment

Protected from Druun by a WALL on one end and water on the
other - Talon is one of the very few towns left in the land
It has the looks of a Southeast Asian Night Market and the
energy of New York’s night life if Manhattan existed on
sampan boats that is

Sisu admires the bright lights

SISU-HUMAN
Wow What a smart way to druun-
proof your house - build right on

Raya’s eyes are focused on the top of the Talon Chief’s home
Her ears however hear a BABY CRY

The LITTLEST ONGI however hangs back and “poses as a stone

DANG HU
Mm-hmm I’1l take you there

SISU-HUMAN
SEE That’s what I’ve been trying
to tell my girl Raya But she’s all
like - “You can’t trust people
Don’t talk to anyone I only eat
terrible foods I dried myself”

Two large HENCHMEN join Sisu and Dang-Hu as they walk

She gives them big smiles but they don’t react to her at
all
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 51

From the looks exchanged between Dang Hu and her “sons” we
sense that she’s more Mob Boss than Sweet Old Mother

The Henchmen nod and lower a draw-bridge for Sisu and Dang Hu
to cross

They cross the bridge and
DANG HU
Come dear Chief Dang Hai is just
outside the city beyond the gates
- they continue on through some gates
SISU-HUMAN

Away from the water huh Wow He
really likes living on the edge

EXT TALON JUNGLE - NIGHT

Dang Hu leads Sisu out of the gates into the jungle It’s
creepy quiet

Sisu is relieved to see someone else out there -
SISU-HUMAN
Hi there Dang Hai I’m Sisu and
I’ve come here to offer you some -
- but is shocked to see it’s a Stone Person

The rattle of druun

Sisu looks and finds a Druun emerge from the woods it
approaches Sisu - but a “glow” pushes it away

Dang Hu stands by the doors with her two large bodyguards

DANG HU
Now you’re going to tell me where
I can find those other dragon gem
pieces Or

Dang Hu reveals she’s hold a dragon gem piece of her own
DANG HU (CONTD)
I’1l have to leave you outside with

that thing Take your pick

The Druun paces back and forth looking for a way past Dang
Hu
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 52
Dang Hu steps backward into the city walls not giving Sisu a
moment to react

SISU-HUMAN
But I trusted you

DANG HU
Big mistake

Dang Hu steps behind the gates
DANG HU (CONTD)
You better talk fast It looks
hungry

More druun begin to emerge from the woods

SISU-HUMAN
No no no

Mob Boss lowers the gem and the Druun rushes towards Sisu as -

Raya and Tuk-Tuk blast through the city gates and grab-up
Sisu -

SISU-HUMAN (CONTD)
RAYA

DANG HU
Stop her

RAYA
Sisu I told you to stay on the
boat

SISU-HUMAN
Sorry

As they sweep past Dang Hu Raya swipes the gem from Dang Hu
hands and gives it to Sisu

RAYA
Hold onto this for me will ya

Raya barrels towards them A giant blast of FOG covers the
area scaring away the druun

Raya clears out Door closes

SISU-HUMAN

was really going to hurt me

RAYA
Well I’m sorry Sisu that’s what

As Sisu sits Noi approaches her She super adorable
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim

SISU-HUMAN

INT FANG THRONE ROOM - DAY
Virana speaks to FANG OFFICERS over a map of Kumandra

GENERAL ATITAYA
Chief Virana we’re running out of
room We need to expand to the
mainland

VIRANA
And how do you propose we handle
the druun General Atitaya Without
proper protection it would be a
death sentence for our people

Namaari enters the palace

RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim

NAMAARTI
I might have a solution for that
mother

VIRANA

(genuinely happy)
My little morning mist it’s good
to see you home

NAMAART

gem pieces

VIRANA
What

Virana reacts looks at her gem on a staff

NAMAART
Id like to take the royal army and
intercept her in Spine

VIRANA
Well if she’s going into Spine I
doubt there will be much left of
her to intercept

NAMAART
She’s more capable than you
realize We have to stop her

Virana hears the anger in her daughter

VIRANA
Walk with me

Virana leads Namaari to the balcony

VIRANA (CONTD)

Look around

(points to Fang)
We made all this by making smart
decisions not emotional ones We
are safe Our canal protects us
from those monsters I don’t think
it’s wise to risk yourself when you
don’t have to

NAMAART
But you heard the General - we’re
running out of space we need to
expand If we had all the gem
pieces we could do that safely
You’re right

(MORE )
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 56

NAMAARI (CONTD)
This isn’t an emotional decision
it’s the only decision we can make
to secure Fang’s future

Virana thinks it over

VIRANA
Namaari you’re truly growing into
the leader I raised you to be
(to the General)
General Atitadya ready the royal
army for my daughter’s command

NAMAART
Thank you Mother I won’t let you
down

RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 58

RAYA
Literally thousands of people
turned to stone would argue
otherwise

SISU-HUMAN
That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t
try

RAYA
And I did And you know what
happened I got kicked in the back
by someone who gave me a “gift” -
Look around We’re a world of
orphans because people couldn’t
stop fighting over a gem Wanna
know why other dragons didn’t come
back Because people don’t deserve
them

SISU-HUMAN
But you can change that

RAYA
I am done trying Kumandra is a
fairy tale The only thing
important to me now is bringing my
ba back

The ship comes to a stop

Clouds part revealing the imposing structure of Spine
Suddenly - Splash - Sisu pops out of the ship storms up the

wrong

RAYA

How By getting squashed by a bunch
of Spine rage-heads

SISU-HUMAN
No By proving to you that if you
want to get someone’s trust you
have to give a little trust first

Sisu walks right up to the Spine village doors and starts
knocking

RAYA

Suddenly a burlap sack swoops from above and traps Raya and
Sisu inside

In hindsight maybe I was a little
hasty But who’s hungry No

Interesting choice of digs
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 60

Suddenly the doors of the cabin open

The silhouette of a large barbarian (TONG) stands there axe
in hand

Tong slams his axe into the wall

TONG
You two must be dung of brain to
think you could steal Spine’s
dragon gem

He slams his axe into some wood

RAYA
Gem Who said anything about gems
We have no interest in gems

Tong drops Raya’s satchel full of gems in it

RAYA (CONTD)
Okay yeah I can see how that
makes me look like a liar

SISU-HUMAN
Actually I think it was the lying
that made you look like a liar

Tong starts maniacally laughing

SISU-HUMAN (CONTD)

TONG
Your fear is like a delectable
nectar feeding the tum tum of my
soul It’s good It tastes like
mango

The giant gates of Spine open
All the Fang Soldiers lower their arrows as
Raya alone armed with only her sword walks out

Hey there princess undercut fancy

My sword here says we’re not

All the Fang soldiers raise their weapons

They start to advance Did Raya’s bluff not work
Namaari’s hand finally signals her men to stop
NAMAARTI
Stand down This shouldn’t take
long

Raya smiles She got she wanted

The two women go at it It’s a martial arts fantasia as our
Luke Skywalker battles with our movie’s Darth Vader

With everyone watching the fight Raya is able to clock Tong
Sisu and the kids start to escape

Raya goes back to the fight and disarms Namaari

RAYA
Didja need that dep la

Namaari kicks Raya’s sword out of her hands

NAMAART
Nah

This is an evenly matched fight
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 65

RAYA
Looks like somebodys been taking
classes

Raya charges and throws her signature move (a 540 kick)
but Namaari catches it in mid-air

Namaari smirks and lets loose a flurry of blows She finally
lands a hit

NAMAARTI
Why are you stealing gem pieces

Raya clocks Tong and the gang escaping from the cabin
RAYA
Oh I’m just trying to get a
matching set
Namaari knocks Raya down again
RAYA (CONTD)
(through gritted teeth)
You didn’t happen to bring Fang’s
gem did you

Smack Raya goes down again

Tong and company escape during the fight but Sisu stops and
looks back She sees Raya on the ground losing the fight

RAYA (CONTD)
No Never mind Ill just swing by
and grab it later

That’s enough - Namaari reels back for the final blow

NAMAARTI
Oh I’m going to enjoy this

But she is interrupted by a blast of FOG

Sisu - in dragon form - scares away the other Fang soldiers
She gets in Namaari’s face and roars

Tong Boun the Baby and Ongis run up and also see the
dragon It stops them in their tracks in awe

Raya gets up and runs to them

RAYA
(approaches the team)
Yep She’s a dragon Let’s go Come
on

Raya ushers them along as they continue to look back in
shock

All of the Fang soldiers are reeling
But Namaari doesn’t flinch staring in wonder at Sisu
Sisu locks eyes with Namaari it rattles her

But then just as fast as she arrived Sisu turns and
disappears into the safety of the forest

the others) are gathered right there - in the spot that will
one day become the dragon gem chamber
They’ve been cornered Druun are all swirling around them

All the other dragons had been

turned to stone We were drowning

in a sea of Druun

Sisu sees an opening

CU on Pengu
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 74

SISU (VO)
But my oldest brother Pengu
refused to accept defeat This is
where wed make our last stand
united

Pengudatu uses his powers to conjure a sphere of water

SISU (VO)
So one by one they combined all
their magic creating the dragon
gem

Each of the dragons concentrate and place their magic into
the gem making it stronger

With the last power added the water-sphere solidifies into a
gem

The four dragons with their hands on the gem turn and look
at Sisu

SISU (VO)
I don’t know why they chose me It
could have been any of us All I
know is I trusted them and they
trusted me And so

The four dragons hand Sisu the gem
They immediately get turned to stone by druun
Sisu stares at the gem takes a calming breath
And on an exhale
Boom
BACK TO THE PRESENT
SISU
When they put their faith in me it
empowered me beyond anything I
could imagine The same can happen
with Namaari
RAYA
I really wish I could believe that
I once thought that we could be

friends

SISU
After all this maybe you can be
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 75

first step even before you’re
ready Trust me

the other lands blame us for what’s
happened

NAMAARI
But we never meant for anyone to
get hurt

VIRANA
Yes but if we had the dragon and
the gem pieces we would be
forgiven We could save the world
But more importantly our people
would remain safe

NAMAARTI
Raya isn’t just going to give Sisu
to us

We’re not going to give her a
choice

A Fang Guard keeps watch as

From behind a wall the eyes of Noi and the Ongis appear
They give each other a look Ready Let’s go

One Ongi ties up the Guard’s legs as another silently climbs
onto his shoulder and - THWAP - judo-chops him on the neck
dropping him

They infiltrate the palace and shuffle down the dark hallways
in military-like fashion

Suddenly Noi holds up her little fist - stop She clocks a
plate of food in the palace kitchen and signals to it The
Ongis quietly retrieve the food

They continue onward shoving the food in their mouths along
the way

Namaari sits at the edge of her bed the dragon scroll open
in her lap

pendant

Tong and Boun argue over a simmering pot which gets Raya’s
attention

Boun gives Raya a bowl of soup

BOUN
I know what you mean I have this
really obnoxious sister who always
tussles my hair I can’t wait to
see her the most

He hands Tong a bowl

TONG
After we win the day I look
forward to filling my eyeball with
the joy-tastic image of my village
full again

Noi on Tong’s shoulder babbles - touches his face

TONG (CONTD)
And you will be reunited with your
family Noi

RAYA
Um what did you just call her

TONG
Noi It’s her name It’s written on
her collar Have none of you ever
checked

Everyone is guilty
TONG (CONTD)
And they think of me as the

ruffian

A firework goes off in the distance and breaks the moment

SISU

RAYA

confirm Namaari’s actually on our
side promise me youll stay

NAMAART

I don’t have any other choice
Raya puts her hand on her sword on guard

RAYA (CONTD)
No

The river begins to roil and then

Rapidly magically the water disappears all around them as
Raya backs away from everyone

BOUN

A heavy emotionally-filled hip-hop beat thumps away as Raya
walks towards the Nation of Fang

CU on her glistening sword blade in one hand In the other
Her shard glowsprotects her as Druun run amok all around

For the first time in this film she truly is “The
Gunslinger”

Raya continues on and walks through the open gates of Fang as
people flee from inside

attacking everyone

But from Raya’s POV they’re all a blur She’s focused on

Boun Tong Noi the Ongis and Tuk-Tuk enter Fang Each
using their gem shards to repel the Druun

It’s complete chaos The Druun have amassed and are swooping
around the city like an unrelenting whirlwind The glow of
the team’s shards barely breaks through the swirling dark
clouds of demon spirits

Boun spots Raya

BOUN
Raya

Raya doesn’t hear him as she is completely engulfed in her
battle with Namaari

TONG
She cannot see us Raya’s blinded
by her own rage

Boun sees people trying to escape the city but it’s chaos

BOUN
(looks at his gem piece)
The gem’s powers are fading All
these people are druun-food if we
don’t get them out

They all nod It’s time to be the heroes they never asked to
be

Boun and Tuk-Tuk help a pair of kids hiding behind debris

BOUN (CONTD)
Come on Trust me it’s gonna be
okay

The kids climb onto Tuk-Tuk and Boun races them out of there

Get to the water Keep going Keep
going

SEQ 460 - RAYA VS NAMAARI

INT FANG CITY - THRONE ROOM —- CONTINUOUS

Raya and Namaari continue to clash It’s an epic sword-fight
(Think the best fights in Star Wars but with steel)

Like their last fight Namaari once again gets the upper
hand But this time instead of backing down

Raya smacks Namaari’s swords out of her hands
Raya kicks her to the ground

As Namaari falls the dragon pendant slides out Namaari
scrambles to grab it She holds onto it

Raya raises her blade

NAMAART
I never meant for any of this to
happen

RAYA
Liar

NAMAART

I don’t care if you believe me
Sisu did But you didn’t trust her
That’s why we’re here

Raya hesitates
NAMAARI (CONTD)
Do whatever you want but you’re as
much to blame for Sisu’s death as I
am

Raya looks at the reflection of her eyes in her raised blade

Namaari closes her eyes
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 88

Raya looks back at her own reflection in her sword and
notices the rage in her eyes

Her ears catch the sound of her friends helping people amid
the destruction She looks outside and sees

BOUN
Tong there’s still people back
there Hurry we’re running out of
time

TONG
Got it Everyone out Come with me

Focus on Namaari
She looks over to where Raya once stood and discovers
Raya’s gone

SEQ 465 - TEAMWORK

EXT FANG CITY - MOMENTS LATER

The camera swoops around Raya as she joins Boun Tong Noi
and the Ongis in their efforts to help people evacuate the
city

It’s a heroic sight of epic proportions (Think Marvel
Studios’ Avengers)

Tuk-Tuk rolls by with a bunch of kids on his back
RAYA
(commands to Tuk-Tuk)
Okay Tuk These are the last of
them Go We’re right behind you
Suddenly

A druun steps in between Tuk-Tuk and the exit

RAYA (CONTD)
Tuk-Tuk

The kids and Tuk-Tuk are in jeopardy until

Namaari leaps in front of the Druun and scares it away with
her own dragon gem shard

NAMAARTI
(to Tuk Tuk)
What are you waiting for Go
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 89

Tuk-Tuk rolls away

Namaari and Raya share a look

But then -

Another earthquake hits Stones fall and crash
All exits are blocked

BOUN
Raya

TONG
(sees Namaari rage-filled
eyes)
It’s the one who slayed Sisu

Another quake

The team falls into rubble

SEQ 470 - WE ARE KUMANDRA

The light in the dragon gem piece begins to fade even more
As Raya comes to

BOUN (0S)
(faint far away)
Raya Raya

Raya sees her team they’re completely engulfed by druun
Their gems are holding them off but the druun continue to
advance as the gem’s powers fade

BOUN (CONTD)
The gem’s magic is almost gone

TONG
They aren’t backing off

BOUN
They’re everywhere

Raya’s eyes catch something shiny on the ground it’s the
dragon pendent

She picks it up triggering a memory
FLASHBACK She’s momentarily transported back to the Heart

temple where the druun once swirled around Sisu and her
siblings She hears Sisu’s faint voice from the past
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 90

SISU (VO)
I don’t know why they chose me It
could have been any one of us All
I know is I trusted them and they
trusted me And so

BACK TO REALITY
That’s it

RAYA
Everyone give me your gems We can
still put it together it can still
work

BOUN
Sisu’s gone Raya We don’t have
her magic

RAYA
It’s not about her magic It’s
about trust

NAMAART
WHAT

RAYA
That’s why it worked That’s why we
can do it too By doing the one
thing Sisu wanted us to do — what
my Ba wanted us to do — to finally
trust each other and fix this But
we have to come together Please

Raya looks to her friends -

TONG
After what she’s done -

BOUN
We’ll never trust her

Noi hisses

Raya looks at her divided team and understands what she must
do

RAYA
Then let me take the first step

Raya hands Namaari her gem piece

BOUN
Raya no
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 91

Raya steps away and is immediately turned to stone
The group is in shock Did that just really happen

Namaari stares at the gem piece in her hands She looks up
and sees Boun his eyes locked onto Raya and his friends

Moved by what he just saw he knows what he has to do He
hands his gem to Namaari as well and then goes to Raya
taking her hand and being turned to stone as well

Namaari’s shook But to add to her confusion Noi and Tong
follow suit They give up their gem pieces to her and moments
later they too are turned to stone along with the Ongis

Pan over to Namaari She has all the gems She’s in shock
She looks up and sees an exit

She has a choice

Namaari starts to flee but stops and looks at Raya’s stone
face

It’s too much she can’t keep going

Namaari returns and hurriedly assembles the gem pieces as the
pulsing light within them continues to DIM

They stick together but the pulsing light within is growing
FAINTER

Namaari places her hand on Raya’s stone shoulder as a Druun
washes over her turning her into stone

On the GEM THE LIGHT GOES OUT Was Namaari too late

SEQ 480 - REBIRTH

For a moment it looks like the Druun have completely won the
day They multiply wreak havoc

Then something happens

INSIDE THE GEM - a TINY PULSE OF LIGHT RETURNS

The light gets bigger and bigger until

BOOM

A blast of light suddenly explodes (just like in the

prologue) destroying all the Druun The light pulses out
through the lands
RAYA AND THE LAST DRAGON - Q Nguyen and A Lim 92
The land is finally free of the monsters but all the
statues remain until that is -

Clouds roll in illuminated by gentle thunder And then a
droplet of glowing rain falls

And then another
And another
Droplets hit the statues of Raya Boun Tong Noi the Ongis
and Namaari As they do the stone coating on their skin
melts away
THEY COME BACK TO LIFE
BOUN
(in disbelief)

It worked It worked It --

Boun trips looks at his feet which are still turning back to
normal

Noi and the Ongis jump happily on Tong

Finally Raya looks over to find Namaari’s hand touching
her shoulder Raya’s trust in her indeed transformed her

Raya touches Namaari’s hand they acknowledge something new

has been born between them

But then

Over the horizon right above newly returned waterfalls an
amazing sight emerges -

All of the DRAGONS gallop through the air towards them

Raya and gang stand in awe as the dragons swirl over
Kumandran River

As they do droplets start to rise

Under the surface of the water a glow
It gets brighter and brighter until -
SPLASH SISU rockets up into the air

She reacts with joy and surprise as she sees the other
dragons now there

Sisu steps aside to reveal Boun Tong Noi the Ongis and
Namaari standing side-by-side

Behind them hundreds of citizens from all over Kumandra are
lined up

Benja is overwhelmed he can’t believe his eyes
RAYA

Ba welcome to Kumandra

As the crowd moves in to cross the bridge Benja looks at
Raya - this is more than anything he could have dreamed of

As Benja and Raya walk into Heart with the crowd he puts an
arm around her and she leans her head on his shoulder

Sisu flies through the air one last time past Raya who
smiles at her from below (End on Sisu)
