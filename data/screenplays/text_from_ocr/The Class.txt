INT CAFE - DAY
The first morning of the new school year

In a Paris café leaning on the bar FRANCOIS 35 or so
peacefully sips coffee In the background we can vaguely
make out a conversation about the results of the
presidential election Frangois looks at his watch and
seems to take a deep breath as if stepping onto a stage

EXT STREET - DAY

Frangois comes out of the café Across the street we
discover a large building whose slightly outdated fagade
is not particularly welcoming He walks over to the
imposing entrance that bears the shield of the City of
Paris in wrought iron and beneath which we read “JAURES
MIDDLE SCHOOL” On the opposite sidewalk coming from the
other end of the street a small group of teachers
hurries towards the entrance Frangois hears them joking

VINCENT
He’s a really great guy not the back-
slapping type but

Frangois greets them in passing

INT CORRIDORS - SCHOOL - DAY

We discover the school’s deserted corridors Through the
doorway of a classroom Frangois sees a few cleaners who
in a very calm atmosphere clean the tables and line them
up neatly wash the windows A short distance further on
a man in overalls applies one last coat of paint to an
administrative notice board

INT MEETING ROOM - DAY

Around the principal in the meeting room the teachers
old or new introduce themselves briefly as in a casting
session

HERVE

colleagues The students can be tough but

OLIVIER

courage

FRANCOIS

everybody

Then the principal hands out the timetables eliciting a
few sighs of satisfaction or disappointment

INT STAFF ROOM - DAY

In the staff room a new arrival listens to the succinct
comments of an older member of staff OLIVIER on the
different students in a second-year class as he runs
through a list

OLIVIER
Nice nice not nice not nice at all
Hes nice not nice watch him not nice
at all nice not nice shes not nice at
all

INT CLASS - DAY

The children noisily enter the glass as Frangois looks
on The students take their places in general confusion
the girls on one side the boys on the other They show
each other their new gear pencil cases brand-name
exercise books Frangois clearly used to this kind of
agitation raises his voice

FRANCOIS
All right all right all right Hey
hey hey Calm down now Stop stirring
things up there and remove your hood
please You two back there theres a
place here One of you comes up front

Things start to calm down

FRANCOIS
Right lets get one thing clear from the
word go Hey I want to get this clear
from the start We waste five minutes
lining up outside five coming up five
settling down fifteen minutes out of an
hour Do you realize what fifteen lost
minutes means With twenty-five hours a
week and thirty weeks in the year we
lose thousands of minutes In other
schools they do a full hour Imagine how
far ahead they get in a year Figure it
out
KHOUMBA a girl with long hair in the style of Diana
Ross speaks up without raising her hand first

KHOUMBA
We never do an hour
FRANCOIS
Put your hand up to speak What is it
KHOUMBA
We never do an hour You always say that
FRANCOIS
What do you mean “we never do an hour”
KHOUMBA
Teachers say we do an hours class but we
never do
FRANCOIS
Yes
KHOUMBA

We never do an hours class We start at
830 and finish at 925 That doesnt
make an hour

FRANCOIS
All right its fifty-five minutes
Thanks thats an important point

KHOUMBA
But we never do an hour Stop saying
other schools do an hour They dont
either

FRANCOIS
All right all Im saying is that we
waste time Like right now To start
with take out a sheet of paper fold it
in two so that it can stand on the edge
of your desk clearly and using block
capitals write your full name on it

While BOUBACAR sluggishly obeys WEY in the front row
translates the instructions into Chinese for his neighbor
and shows her how to do it A few rows behind them
ESMERALDA Khoumba’s friend and neighbor butts in

ESMERALDA
Why do we have to write our names

FRANCOIS
So I can get to know who you are
ESMERALDA
But you know us

LOUISE
We had you last year

FRANCOIS

Esmeralda I dont know if youve
noticed but half of the kids here are
new So it can help Be happy This way
people will know your name

ESMERALDA
Im not doing it

FRANCOIS
Cut it out

ESMERALDA

I wont if you dont

FRANCOIS
Ah you have a point For those of you
who dont know me Im Mr Marin

ESMERALDA

Ms Marin
BOUBACAR

Hey are you a marine
SOULEYMANE

He wiped you out that’s wicked
FRANCOIS

Very funny
BOUBACAR

He didn’t wipe you out he busted you

FRANCOIS

Come on it shouldnt take so long You
should be a lot quicker Five minutes to
write a name Thats ridiculous

INT STAFF ROOM - DAY

SOPHIE in passing offers a biscuit to RACHEL and
Frangois who is sitting nearby

SOPHIE
A biscuit for the first day
FRANCOIS
Im okay thanks

ANNE
I wouldn’t mind one

SOPHIE
Rachel a biscuit will buck you up

RACHEL
Thanks

INT CLASS - DAY

On the board Frangois writes the words that the students

haven’t understood in the text that they are studying

slightly affected student raises his hand

FRANCOIS

All right Witty Thats a word well
try to explain later Are there any other

words in the text that you dont
understand Burak

BURAK
The word condescension

Frangois notes the word on the board just under other
more or less complicated words He turns to the class

FRANCOIS

The word condescension yes thats a
complicated word Do you have any idea
Burak what that might mean Any idea at

all

BURAK
A vague idea but Im not sure

FRANCOIS

Youre not sure All right well talk

about that later then Yes Damien

DAMIEN
Argentite

FRANCOIS
Argentite What does that mean

DAMIEN
Its people who live in Argentina

A
FRANCOIS
Right exactly the inhabitants of
Argentina

ESMERALDA
Wow what a moron Wicked

FRANCOIS
Argentites and Argentitesses No of
course not Damien who lives in
Argentina

DAMIEN
The Argentites

FRANCOIS
No you know thats not right you watch
soccer on TV Argentinas players are
called

DAMIEN
Footballers

SOULEYMANE
Oh what a big kid

A discreet-looking student raises her hand

FRANCOIS
Lets move on Any other difficult words
in this text Henriette Is there
anything that you didnt understand I
imagine there is

HENRIETTE
“Henceforth”

FRANCOIS
Henceforth Thanks for the prompt
Samantha All right I think that will
do Lets take a look at these words All
right Austrian Wey was the one who
picked the word Austrian Yes
Esmeralda

ESMERALDA
I mean we all know what Austrian is
People from Austria

FRANCOIS
Okay but Wey doesnt know and well
Austrian isnt really
ESMERALDA
Maybe but hes the only one everyone
else knows

FRANCOIS
Okay we get the message You didnt know
misleading so youre not really in any
position to talk about all that We agree
on that

ESMERALDA
Yes but everyone knows what Austrian
means Its easy

FRANCOIS
Look here nobodys perfect Besides
Austrian is not a very important word
It refers to someone from the land of
Austria which is a pretty tiny country
We can live without the word For
example can anyone name a famous
Austrian

Not one hand is raised

BOUBACAR
Mozart “Wolfang” Amadeus Mozart

FRANCOIS
What do you call him

BOUBACAR
“Wolfang” Amadeus Mozart

FRANCOIS
He could have been Wolfang maybe if he
were English not Austrian Mozart was
Austrian yes but do you know any other
famous Austrians So basically Austria
could vanish from the map and no one
would notice But seriously its a
country south of Germany So check a map
Wey Youll see where it is Souleymane
can you note the words too like everyone
else

Frangois’ blatant insincerity inspires a few collusive
smiles in the class Wey is delighted to have understood
that his teacher is joking

SOULEYMANE
I forgot my things
FRANCOIS
And no one can lend you some paper so you
can do it

SOULEYMANE
No it’s okay Ill do it at home

FRANCOIS
Youll do it at home Sure you will
Thats your approach Not a stroke of
work in class and everything done at
home

SOULEYMANE
Im serious Don’t worry it’1ll be okay
it’1l be okay Thanks

Souleymane convinced that he has had the last word
seems fairly pleased with himself Frangois turns to the
list of words on the board again

FRANCOIS
All right lets move on to succulent
Succulent is a word that well try to
guess the meaning of Whats in
succulent Suck

BOUBACAR
Suck off

ESMERALDA
Jerk

FRANCOIS

Very funny Boubacar Very witty indeed

SOULEYMANE
He should be sent out for that sir

FRANCOIS
Ill give you a sentence with
succulent Bill enjoys a succulent
cheeseburger

On either side of the word on the board he writes a
sentence “Bill enjoys a succulent cheeseburger” And he
underlines the word “succulent” A voice speaks out
behind him

CHERIF
Cheeseburgers are crap they stink

FRANCOIS
Who said that
RABAH
Cheeseburgers are the best

CHERIF
I said it Why a cheeseburger

FRANCOIS
Well since you say they stink that
means you think cheeseburgers arent
succulent

CHERIF
I don’t care but cheeseburgers are crap

FRANCOIS
All right but what I mean is what I
just said about cheeseburgers should have
made the penny drop

Those who know become more and more impatient

ANGELICA
Sir sir what does that mean

FRANCOIS
What does what mean

ANGELICA
The penny thing

FRANCOIS
To make the penny drop That should
make the penny drop No one knows the
expression

STUDENT (0S)
A clue

FRANCOIS
Thats it If the penny drops it means
youre given a clue When I say if Cherif
thinks cheeseburgers stink it means he
doesnt think theyre succulent that
should help you see what succulent

means
KHOUMBA
Whats with the Bills
FRANCOIS
What bills
KHOUMBA

Not bills the name Bill

ESMERALDA
Bill and Ben

KHOUMBA
You always use weird names Why don’t you
use

FRANCOIS

Its not a weird name A recent US
President was called Bill remember

KHOUMBA
Why dont you use Aissata or Rachid or
Ahmed or
ESMERALDA
You always use whitey names It’s wicked
FRANCOIS
What names
ESMERALDA
Honky names
FRANCOIS

Whats a honky

ESMERALDA
Honkies Frenchies frogs

Frangois seems a little put out as if he had been trying
to avoid this kind of discussion

FRANCOIS
Youre not French Esmeralda
ESMERALDA
No Im not French
FRANCOIS
Really I didnt know
ESMERALDA
Well I am French but I’m not proud of
it
FRANCOIS

Fine Im not either actually

ESMERALDA
Wiped him out

FRANCOIS
Neither am I in fact I’m not proud to
be French either

KHOUMBA
Why do you use these names then

FRANCOIS
Khoumba if I start choosing names to
suit your different ethnic origins itll
never end

KHOUMBA and ESMERALDA
But change them a bit

STUDENT (0S)

KHOUMBA and ESMERALDA

FRANCOIS
So what do you suggest

KHOUMBA and ESMERALDA
Er Aissata

STUDENT (0S)
Mamadou Bintou

KHOUMBA and ESMERALDA
Fatou No Aissata Aissata

STAFF ROOM - DAY

In the depths of his locker Frangois finds a mandarin
orange that seems to have been there for some time

Frédéric comes to sit down next to Frangois a coffee in

FREDERIC
Excuse me Do you have class 43 in
French

FRANCOIS

Yes Im the class supervisor too

FREDERIC
Do you already know what book youll be
reading

FRANCOIS
No I havent decided yet

FREDERIC
Because in history Ill be starting with
the Ancien Régime If you want to link
into that what kind of books are there

FRANCOIS
Well theres the Enlightenment but
that’s tough for them in their year

FREDERIC

How about Voltaire Is he tough
FRANCOIS

Well hes not easy
FREDERIC

I dont know Candide is an easy read
FRANCOIS

Not in their year
FREDERIC

“Zadig”
FRANCOIS

Yes maybe but it’d be tough

INT CLASS - DAY

Frangois has bags under his eyes and seems to be having a
bad day Behind him on the board a verb is conjugated
in the imperfect tense The verb endings have been
underlined

The whole class silent works on an exercise Frangois
seems to be miles away His weary gaze sweeps over the
class All of a sudden he speaks

FRANCOIS
Okay in 20 seconds we correct it

BOUBACAR
No sir please We havent finished

With some sweeping gestures DALLA asks Rabah in the
opposite row for the time Rabah starts to reply with
equally exaggerated gestures Frangois seems to snap out
of his daze and answers curtly

FRANCOIS
We cant spend two hours on the
imperfect Dalla you can ask me for the
time if you want

With an involuntary wink she signals to NASSIM whose pen
has leaked over his jacket Frangois on discovering the
scene raises his eyes to the heavens in exasperation

NASSIM
Sir this crap pen keeps leaking Its
getting on my nerves

FRANCOIS
Who has a handkerchief for

Rabah takes a tissue out of his pocket and stands to take
it to Nassim

RABAH
Me

FRANCOIS
Rabah Rabah Ask before you stand okay

Rabah sits back down

RABAH
May I

In passing Rabah trips over his neighbors bag and stops
himself from falling by grabbing Juliette’s shoulder
sprawling over her exaggeratedly She pushes him away
roughly

FRANCOIS
Yes Gently okay

BOUBACAR
The perv He touched her tits The perv

FRANCOIS
Come on just give him the handkerchief
Boubacar spare us your comments

SOULEYMANE (0S)
Goddam pedophile You big kid

ESMERALDA
Sir sir

FRANCOIS
Okay okay Quiet
SOULEYMANE (0S)
You ain’t got a chick or what You need
to press up against chicks Rabah

FRANCOIS
Hey take it easy

Only Esmeralda doesn’t burst out laughing She seems

bothered by something As she thinks she ends up asking

her question

FRANCOIS
(to Esmeralda)
Yes

ESMERALDA
Sir why do they say the imperfect
indicative

SOULEYMANE (0S)
If you want chicks let me know I’11l
give you contacts

Frangois seems happy that Esmeralda is so motivated
speaks to her with gentleness

FRANCOIS
Quiet Souleymane All right Esmeralda
why the indicative

She raises her eyes to the heavens

ESMERALDA
Youre pushing it If I knew I wouldnt
ask

FRANCOIS

I can imagine How about the others Does
anyone know why we specify the imperfect
indicative Why not just the imperfect

Nassim

NASSIM
Do you mind if I go wash my hands
because

FRANCOIS

Go on wash them and get it over with

STUDENT (0S)
He’s gonna visit the corridors

FRANCOIS
Make it quick
STUDENT (0S)
He’ll be back in a week I’m going with
him

FRANCOIS
All right enough If we talk
specifically about the imperfect
indicative that means its different
than another imperfect Which imperfect
is that Agam

AGAM answers calmly

AGAM
The imperfect subjunctive

FRANCOIS
Exactly The imperfect subjunctive Can
anyone give me an example of the
imperfect subjunctive I dont believe
it Khoumba go on

KHOUMBA
Hold on I may be wrong

Frangois gives her an encouraging smile

FRANCOIS
Yes I think so too
KHOUMBA
I were
FRANCOIS
I were Of course from the verb to
werr
KHOUMBA
No I were I don’t know
ESMERALDA
I wuz
KHOUMBA
No I were you were you were they
were
FRANCOIS

All right Thats not bad but you use it
wrongly You vaguely recall the imperfect
subjunctive Imagine I say He insists
that I be - lets say - in shape What
is be in that example Eva
EVA
The present subjunctive

FRANCOIS
Very good For the imperfect subjunctive
we follow the sequence of tenses and use
a past He insisted

BOUBACAR

He insisted he insisted that I be
FRANCOIS

He insisted that I Khoumba
KHOUMBA

Were
FRANCOIS

Were yes
ESMERALDA

You really think Ill tell my mom He
insisted that I wered been in shape
And that shell understand

FRANCOIS
Not I wered been Learn to use it
before you start complaining

ESMERALDA
He insisted that I wered been in shape

FRANCOIS
That I were in shape Use the sequence
of tenses

ESMERALDA
But no one says that in real life its
true its true

KHOUMBA
I was right I were

FRANCOIS
All right will you let me answer the
question that you asked me If you care

ESMERALDA
Yes you may
FRANCOIS
The first thing I notice is before
mastering something the imperfect
subjunctive youre already telling me
its no use Start by mastering it then
you can call its use into question

ESMERALDA

Sir why are you criticizing us
FRANCOIS

What
ANGELICA

Theyre right its not the way people
talk now thats the way they talked in
the old days Even my gran didnt say
that

BOUBACAR
Or your great granddad Its from the
Middle Ages

FRANCOIS
No it’s not from the Middle Ages and for
starters

BOUBACAR
It is

ESMERALDA
Of course it is

KHOUMBA
Its bourgeois

ANGELICA
Tell me when was the last time you heard
someone talk like that When was the last
time you heard someone talk like that

FRANCOIS
Yesterday with friends we used the
imperfect subjunctive
(he is briefly interrupted by
jeers)
All right all right Can I reply

BOUBACAR
Yep

FRANCOIS
Im ready to talk this over but calmly
All right its true not everyone talks
that way In fact people who do are
pretty rare Ill grant you that Id
even say only snobs use the imperfect
subjunctive

ANGELICA
Whats a snob

FRANCOIS
Snobs are slightly affected slightly
precious people who tend to put on airs

He makes an precious gesture with his wrist A student’s
voice rises up from the back of the class convinced that
he has found the answer

BOUBACAR
Homosexuals

This remark makes Frangois smile

FRANCOIS
No not homosexuals You can be affected
and refined without being homosexual
Boubacar In any case what I see is that
this register may seem formal and a bit
affected and even bourgeois But the
important fact is these different
registers exist as I keep telling you
and as I shall carry on telling you I
think You need to be able to use them
all familiar current formal oral and
written Move between them and use them
all Yes Lucie

LUCIE
How do we know whats for written and
whats for oral

FRANCOIS
Why is a word more for one register than
the other Normally thats something
that you pick up as you go along You
need to use intuition

DAMIEN
What’s intuition

FRANCOIS
Intuition is when you cant use thinking
When you cant really Its not knowing
but more like sensing something Thats
it Intuition is when you sense things

DAMIEN
What if you dont sense them

FRANCOIS
If you dont sense them well You gain
intuition by using the language Thats
when you learn to distinguish almost
automatically between oral and written

styles
BOUBACAR

Sir Souleymane wants to say something
SOULEYMANE

Shut your mouth Shut it
FRANCOIS

What does Souleymane want to say
BOUBACAR

But please okay say it
FRANCOIS

What is it What Calm down
BOUBACAR

If he says it youll tell
FRANCOIS

Cut it out No fighting
SOULEYMANE

Ill whop you
BOUBACAR

Go ahead bro just quit playing the

tough guy

Frangois is surprised to see Souleymane who has been
talking with his neighbor for the last few minutes with
his hand raised

FRANCOIS
Souleymane whats wrong

SOULEYMANE
I’11 whop you one

FRANCOIS
Boubacar turn round Boubacar turn
round What is it Souleymane

SOULEYMANE
Nothing

Boubacar who seems to know what his friend’s question
is takes over from him

BOUBACAR
Say it bro
FRANCOIS
Apparently something is up
BOUBACAR
Dont send him to the principal if he
says it
SOULEYMANE

If I tell you Im good for Guantanamo

Frangois takes an obvious pleasure in pushing Souleymane
who himself is having fun upping the stakes

FRANCOIS
No no

STUDENTS
(as one)
Guantanamo Guantanamo Guantanamo

SOULEYMANE
Forget it Ill be tased

FRANCOIS

No you wont be tased as you put it
SOULEYMANE

No no no
FRANCOIS

What is it You have a question
SOULEYMANE

Yep
FRANCOIS

So ask it
SOULEYMANE

Its too wicked Its too wicked

FRANCOIS
No it’s not too wicked

SOULEYMANE
But its the pits for you

FRANCOIS
Look now weve come to this just ask
it

SOULEYMANE
I have your word

FRANCOIS
Hurry it up

SOULEYMANE

I dont know This is what I heard okay
I didnt say it but I heard People say
you like men I didnt say it

FRANCOIS
Who says that
SOULEYMANE
Well just people see
FRANCOIS
Really
SOULEYMANE
They say Mr Marin likes men and all
that

Different reactions in the class We hear laughter and
cries of surprise Frangois smiles as if he had been
expecting this question sooner or later

FRANCOIS

Okay So others say that not you
SOULEYMANE

No
FRANCOIS

No you’re not interested
Souleymane squirms on his chair smiling awkwardly

SOULEYMANE
No I don’t give a damn

FRANCOIS
So why ask the question then

SOULEYMANE
It’s for the others Im a spokesman
FRANCOIS
But the question doesn’t interest you at
all
SOULEYMANE
I dont give a damn If you like men
fine
FRANCOIS
Exactly

Unwilling to back down now that he has come this far and
perhaps basking in the prestige that he is acquiring with
the rest of the class Souleymane insists

SOULEYMANE
So is it true or not

FRANCOIS
So you are asking me

SOULEYMANE
Homosexual isnt an insult sir It isn’t
an insult

FRANCOIS
You say it isnt but it seems to be a
problem for you You find it odd men
liking other men

SOULEYMANE
Maybe it is I dont know But is it true
or not
FRANCOIS
No its not Feel better now
SOULEYMANE
Yeah Sure
FRANCOIS
Sorry to disappoint you That’s how it

is
Souleymane simply pouts dubiously

ESMERALDA

INT CLASS - DAY

Justine comes up to the board looking a little worried
Her classmates stare at her as if she were climbing the
gallows She hesitates for a second but then picks up the
chalk and takes the plunge She starts declining a verb
making a mess of it then hurriedly erases the word that
she has just written The suspense is perceptible
Justine ends up turning to Frangois

ANGELICA
Hold on that’s not it

KHOUMBA
She screwed up there She thinks its a
regular verb

ANGELICA

FRANCOIS

(to the rest of the class)
Thats enough now

ESMERALDA
What’s up sir

FRANCOIS

RABAH

FRANCOIS
What Im seeing here is that you cant
focus for more than 20 seconds like 3-
year-olds People aged 13 14 or 15 like
youre supposed to be If I ask a
question they should answer fast and
then we waste no more time

KHOUMBA
Your kidding around goes too far

FRANCOIS
Not at all I don’t think I go too far

KHOUMBA
Everyone thinks you go too far Sorry

INT CLASS - DAY

It’s cold outside The students in their winter
clothing seem very excitable On their desks we see
“The Diary of Anne Frank” Some of them read the first
few pages of it amid the general hubbub

FRANCOIS
One extract isnt a lot to read for
today No one did it Were wasting a
crazy amount of time here Okay lets
read it or reread it then Who wants to
read Great Excellent work atmosphere
today Khoumba go on

KHOUMBA
I’m not reading
FRANCOIS
What do you mean you’re not reading
KHOUMBA
I don’t want to read
FRANCOIS
So the class revolves around your desires
now
KHOUMBA

I dont want to read

FRANCOIS
I don’t care if you don’t want to read

Khoumba’s sole reply is a sneering sound that immediately
annoys Frangois He addresses the other twenty-four
students as witnesses

FRANCOIS
What did Khoumba just do Wey
WEY
Sneer
FRANCOIS
No I meant her attitude What did she
show
They all think hard
BOUBACAR

Insolence

FRANCOIS
Yes thats right youre an expert

KHOUMBA
Youre standing there all angrulo with
me What is this

FRANCOIS
Im not thats not true And try saying
it in French What am I

KHOUMBA
Angrulo

FRANCOIS
Say it in everyday French please

KHOUMBA
You’re wired at me

FRANCOIS
Thats normal French

KHOUMBA
Youve got it in for me

Frangois is clearly spoiling for a fight and doesn’t want
to leave it at this

FRANCOIS
Not at all I just want you to read And
I think I have the right to ask you to
read dont I

KHOUMBA
No

FRANCOIS
You dont think so

KHOUMBA
No No one has read it and youre picking
on me What is this

FRANCOIS
Not at all I’m not picking on you I
want to work and Ive chosen you

KHOUMBA
Yeah sure give me a break

FRANCOIS
And I have the right to as your French
teacher
KHOUMBA
Just drop it I said Drop it

FRANCOIS
Shut up now We’re listening

KHOUMBA

Yeah sure No way I’m not reading You
tell me to shut up then to read What is
this

FRANCOIS

KHOUMBA
Make your mind up Think it through

Frangois has heard enough

FRANCOIS
All right you can come see me after
class and well talk it over It wont be
fun

KHOUMBA

FRANCOIS
You wont say that later All right
Esmeralda are you on strike too or can
you read for us

ESMERALDA
Its her life I don’t give a damn
FRANCOIS
Very good In that case will you read
for us
ESMERALDA

Id be delighted to

FRANCOIS
All right Esmeralda were listening

While Esmeralda reads the extract the other students
listen more or less attentively Khoumba on the other
hand seems as furious as before

ESMERALDA
Dear Kitty Im known as a bundle of
contradictions As Ive told you several
times my soul is split in two

(MORE)

ESMERALDA (CONTD)
On one side my exuberant cheerfulness
my mocking approach to everything my joy
in life and my ability to take things
lightly By that I mean not seeing any
wrong in flirting giving a kiss
embracing someone or telling a tasteless
joke That side lies in wait pushing
back the other side which is more
beautiful purer and deeper The truth is
that no one knows Annes better side and
thats why most people cant stand me I
can be an amusing clown for an afternoon
but then everyone has had enough of me
So the nice Anne has never once been seen
in company But in her loneliness she
always triumphs My best to you Anne
Frank Annes diary ends here

FRANCOIS
Anne Franks diary ends here Why
Because the police turned up at the rooms
where Anne Franks family was hiding and
deported them all Anne Frank died
shortly after Thats what I asked
earlier and what weve talked about
several times already When I read this
I learn about Anne Frank because she
talks about herself and so I get to know
her When I ask you to write your own
self-portraits Ill expect the same In
other words to learn things through your
feelings You can also talk about facts
that will allow me to know you better
Yes Lucie

LUCIE
What we write wont be as gripping as as
what Anne Frank wrote Our lives arent
as gripping

FRANCOIS
All right Juliette

JULIETTE
Well someone aged 70 could talk about
their life but we have nothing to tell
at 13

FRANCOIS
I dont know at 14 15 or even 13
youve had experiences
JULIETTE
Less than a man or a woman aged 70
Theyve lived a lot more theyre nearly
through

STUDENT (0OS)
They have more to pass on

FRANCOIS
Its funny Basically you dont think
your lives are interesting

ANGELICA
I dont know sir What do we do We just
come to school go home eat and sleep

FRANCOIS
Really You come to school eat sleep
Fine Okay so the bare facts of your
life are dull But what you feel
Angelica thats whats interesting

ANGELICA
But thats my business

FRANCOIS
Yes maybe but Im interested

ANGELICA
Yes but you’re different

FRANCOIS
Why am I different I perfectly normal

ANGELICA
Because youre a teacher thats why

FRANCOIS
But this isnt the teacher talking

ESMERALDA
Its your job

FRANCOIS
You could say its the human being

ANGELICA
Okay but well I think youre only
saying that to get us to talk and stuff
but its not true

FRANCOIS
Really What isnt true

ANGELICA
The fact that youre interested in
knowing all that

FRANCOIS
So you think Im lying that Im not
interested in you at all and that Im
pushing at this to convince you its
interesting

ANGELICA
No its not that but its not as
interesting as you say

FRANCOIS
Maybe I am exaggerating a little Its
only natural since you dont agree with
me But deep down Im totally sincere
Why is it such a problem for you to talk
about your lives Boubacar

BOUBACAR
Well theres stuff Theres private
stuff

FRANCOIS
Yes of course What could be hard to say
about your private lives Burak

BURAK
Well we may be ashamed to say certain
things

FRANCOIS
Yes it has to do with shame There are
things you find it hard to say and even
harder to write maybe

BURAK
Well yes

FRANCOIS
And in your life your personal life
when were you ashamed

BOUBACAR
You can be ashamed of a pals mom

FRANCOIS
Ashamed of a pals mom Why Because you
find her ugly

BOUBACAR
No its not that For instance Rabahs
mom She offered me lunch at his place
but I refused because I was ashamed

FRANCOIS
You were ashamed to eat with Rabahs
mother

BOUBACAR
Yeah
FRANCOIS
Because you think she’s unworthy of you
BOUBACAR
No
FRANCOIS
I dont understand Tell me why
Boubacar
BOUBACAR

Im ashamed to eat in front of her
because I respect her

FRANCOIS
So you never eat in front of people you
respect

BOUBACAR
No its not that I mean shes not my
girlfriend

FRANCOIS
So you can only eat in front of your
girlfriend Tell me why Boubacar Im
interested

BOUBACAR
I cant explain it In any case Im
ashamed I always hang out with Rabah so
I respect his mom I dont eat in front
of her thats all

FRANCOIS
So well know now that if Boubacar eats
in front of us it means he doesnt
respect us

BOUBACAR
No its not that You cant understand
You cant understand
FRANCOIS
I cant understand Im not smart enough

BOUBACAR
No its not that You just cant
understand

FRANCOIS
Rabah

RABAH
The other week I was at a party with
nothing but Camemberters

FRANCOIS
Nothing but Camemberters

RABAH

RABAH
Someone who stinks of cheese

FRANCOIS
So you went to a party where everyone
stank of cheese

RABAH
They were all in suits and ties I was in
my baggies and got these weird looks

FRANCOIS
And you were ashamed

RABAH

FRANCOIS
Basically they were embarrassed in front
of you and so you felt embarrassed in
front of them

RABAH
No they werent embarrassed They looked
at me like I was an ET

FRANCOIS

BOUBACAR (0S)

photo on it someday Is it normal to
refuse to read when a teacher asks you
to Is that normal

KHOUMBA

screws up doesnt mean I can turn a blind
eye to this Does it

KHOUMBA
Okay

FRANCOIS

Hurry Im listening

KHOUMBA
I apologize for being insolent May I go
now please Thank you

ESMERALDA
You joker

FRANCOIS
Cut it out

Khoumba has spoken mechanically with a total lack of
conviction

Frangois ends up handing her report book back She takes
it and skips over to the door Just as she is about to
vanish off along the corridor she turns to Frangois and
exclaims

KHOUMBA
I didnt mean it
ESMERALDA
You wiped him out big time Way too

wicked

Frangois leaps up from his desk but it’s too late The
girl has already vanished off along the corridor to the
giggles of her friends Frangois kicks a chair in
annoyance

INT MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

It’s night time We are in the meeting room The tables
have been set out in a U-shape Five or six teachers a
member of the school’s administration parents’
representatives two students (a boy and a girl from year
four) are present

PRINCIPAL
Two weeks ago at the last meeting the
teachers suggested introducing a penalty
point system for the students based on
the driving license system If students
broke a rule they would lose points As
its the teachers idea Ill let them
speak

STEPHANE
Since last September weve noticed an
increase in problems within the school
Punishment has no effect on the students
So we had the idea of a penalty system
The students would have for example six
points each and depending on the
misdeed theyd lose one or two points

PARENTS’ REP 1
And when they run out of points

STEPHANE
When they get down to zero they go
before the disciplinary committee

PARENTS’ REP 2
As a parents representative this is
typical of the schools bad habits
(MORE)
PARENTS’ REP 2 (CONTD)
You always condemn the students but never
praise them

SOPHIE
But they earn praise on their own They
do it with their grades by moving up a
class and we do it in staff meetings by
encouraging them to work if their grades
are below average Then theres the honor
roll the congratulations That all
counts

BURAK’S MOTHER
In your system you take away points for
misdeeds but why not go further and give
points to those who do good things

SOPHIE
Like gold stars

JULIE
Im all for praising the students but if
students collect points and end up with
34 points say that leaves room for all
kinds of trouble we cant control

FREDERIC
Without going as far as these imaginary
34 points six points to start with means
they can cause trouble without
punishment Im sorry but losing a point
or two isnt a real punishment It can
create a dangerous sense of impunity For
me the ideas totally wrong-headed

PRINCIPAL
In that case we could find a punishment
where the students lose all their points
in one go But why bother with the points
in that case

SOPHIE
That’s the whole problem

PRINCIPAL
It’s not simple

FRANCOIS

You know what you call a sense of
impunity gives us room to maneuver When
youre dealing with punishments that are
cut and dried you cant adapt them to
each case

FREDERIC
No I dont agree The rules apply in the
same way to all the students They break
them theyre punished If not why
bother with rules

FRANCOIS
Maybe but dealing with extremely strict
rules creates the greatest tension Take
cell phones for instance We agreed on a
rule that cell phones were not allowed in
class Well sorry but I break that rule
because I realized it wasnt a problem
for me Theres room to maneuver to be
tolerant

FREDERIC
Sure thats the reign of the arbitrary

FARIDA
No the law and the spirit of the law

PRINCIPAL
Now then I know we could talk all night
but thats not possible We have other
topics to tackle In particular one
vital issue a very sensitive one
concerning the coffee machine that the
teachers have asked to talk about

SOPHIE
Its a sensitive issue all right
Everyone agrees theres a real problem
with the coffee machine this year The
price of a coffee has gone up from 40
centimes to 50 centimes That may seem
petty but since we drink several coffees
a day at 8 at 10 or at 4 in the
afternoon it works out at a lot So
weve clubbed together to buy a coffee
maker That way we can drink as much
coffee as we want without having to

count

PRINCIPAL
Monsieur Pierre will be delighted to
reply

Monsieur Pierre the bursar starts speaking shyly All
the same we can tell that nothing will stop him

MONSIEUR PIERRE
Yes First of all Id like to remind you
that this machine was installed in 2001
to replace a machine that needed the
intervention of an outside company for
restocking repairs etc It was very
expensive and not at all profitable We
switched to the new machine which isnt
profitable yet

SOPHIE
Im sorry to hear that

Used to the bursar’s endless speeches the people present
exchange embarrassed looks that Monsieur Pierre his eyes
glued to his notes haughtily ignores

MONSIEUR PIERRE
And so we increased the price of coffee
by ten centimes to fifty centimes There
The thing has to be economically viable

SOPHIE
Isn’t anyone shocked by this

PRINCIPAL
Its clear and logical to me

INT MEETING ROOM and CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Gathered around a meager buffet all the people attending
the meeting sip champagne Frangois quickly slips out to
smoke a cigarette in the yard

INT CORRIDOR - NIGHT

We find Frangois alone walking down a long dark
corridor as the sounds of the small party fade

INT STAFF ROOM - NIGHT

He pushes open the door of the staff room Two CLEANING
WOMEN who were chatting peacefully pick up their gear and
apologize Frangois tells them that they can stay but
the two women have already slipped out into the corridor
Frangois opens his locker and pulls out a pile of papers
on which the mandarin orange is balanced Frangois puts
the fruit back in the depths of the locker and
automatically sniffs the first sheet before reading it
It’s the work that he gave Khoumba as punishment

We can just make out the title written in block
capitals “RESPECT”

KHOUMBA (VO)
Respect Adolescents learn to respect
their teachers little by little because
of their threats or the fear of having
problems For starters I respect you and
respect must be mutual For instance I
dont say youre hysterical so why do
you say I am Ive always respected you
so I dont understand why I have to write
this In any case I know you have it in
for me but I dont know why I have
decided to sit at the back of the class
from now on to avoid any other conflicts
unless you come looking for them I admit
I can be insolent but only if Im
provoked I wont look at you again so
you cant say my look is insolent In
theory in a French class you talk about
French not your grandma your sister or
girls periods And so from now on I
wont speak to you again Signed Khoumba

INT CLASS - DAY

Khoumba’s voice continues over this next scene While
Frangois is at his desk the students work on their self-
portraits with more or less care Some have “The Diary of
Anne Frank” open on their desks Others daydream or chat
in low voices On the blackboard we can read “I work on
my self-portrait” Frangois goes from table to table
advising the different students

FRANCOIS
Why are you hiding it like that Whats
wrong

RABAH

Its a secret

FRANCOIS
A secret It wont stay a secret for
long Esmeralda why have you changed
places

ESMERALDA
No reason I just wanted to

FRANCOIS
Is there a problem
ESMERALDA
No not at all No problem I just wanted
a change of scene

He turns to Khoumba who immediately looks away

FRANCOIS
Okay thats enough Lets get to work

BOUBACAR
No sir please Please sir

FRANCOIS
Youre just copying what you did at home
Youve had plenty of time

BOUBACAR
That’s right that’s right but sir we
have to do it neatly here Please

FRANCOIS

youngest My hobby is playing video
games at least 4 hours a day I find it

expressing myself that others dont
understand me Thats why I dont
communicate much I hardly ever go out
Nothing much interests me outside The
environment doesnt suit me here since
Im allergic but I dont know what

ESMERALDA
Allergic to yourself thats why they

students)

FRANCOIS
It looks a lot like your writing though
RABAH
My writing No way
FRANCOIS
It does But theres no shame in liking
cleavage
RABAH

Is this my writing

Frangois looks around the class His gaze settles on
Souleymane

FRANCOIS
Its not a sin Souleymane stop rocking
and read your self-portrait Im curious
to hear it

The adolescent sprawled on his chair sits up straight
taking his time

SOULEYMANE
Huh
FRANCOIS
No not huh
SOULEYMANE

FRANCOIS
But I’m sure you did I saw you writing
earlier
SOULEYMANE
No I wrote nothing
FRANCOIS
You did
SOULEYMANE

Nothing
FRANCOIS
We’re listening

SOULEYMANE
Im Souleymane I have nothing to say
about me because no one knows me but me

After a moment’s silence Frangois says ironically

FRANCOIS
(calming the jeers of the
other students)
Okay okay enough Thats good A bit
long maybe How come you cant make the
effort that the others did

SOULEYMANE
I dont like talking about myself thats
all

FRANCOIS

How come the others make the effort and
you dont

SOULEYMANE
Well if they do thats their problem I
dont talk about my life okay

FRANCOIS
Really

This leads to a little laughter Esmeralda can’t stop
herself from making fun of Souleymane

ESMERALDA
Its not that he doesnt want to he just
cant write thats all

SOULEYMANE
Whats up you cop You want to be a cop
and you’re talking to me Goddam cop

ESMERALDA
I can live with it

FRANCOIS
All right that’s enough

SOULEYMANE
Get lost cop Arrest guys instead of

ESMERALDA
Chill French guy

SOULEYMANE
Your breath stinks

ESMERALDA
Chill okay

SOULEYMANE

FRANCOIS
Souleymane Souleymane theres no need
to be offensive

SOULEYMANE
I can lend you a toothbrush if you want

FRANCOIS
Okay cut it out Souleymane youre a
lot better at oral insults youre great
at that but when it comes to writing
nobodys home

ESMERALDA
He cant even write his name

Souleymane’s sole reply is to point to a tattoo in Arabic
that he has on his neck

SOULEYMANE
Zip it What does this say
ESMERALDA
Go on then the same old shit with your

Koran
Souleymane becomes indignant

SOULEYMANE
Shut your mouth Whats wrong with the
Koran Ill spare you my shit when you

ESMERALDA
Go on piss us off that’s from the
Koran

FRANCOIS

Hey calm down

SOULEYMANE
It’s the Koran so shut your mouth

ESMERALDA

SOULEYMANE
I’m not making it up

Frangois comes over and tries to see the tatoo

FRANCOIS
Whats that tattoo Souleymane Why are
you showing it to us

ESMERALDA
He says its from the Koran but that’s
not for sure

SOULEYMANE
Shut your mouth

FRANCOIS
Hey hey What is it What is that
tattoo Why are you showing it to us

SOULEYMANE
It’s nothing it’s nothing

Boubacar comes to his rescue

BOUBACAR
It means shut your mouth shut your
mouth

SOULEYMANE
You shut your mouth That’s not what it
means

FRANGOIS
So give us the right translation Go on
tell us

SOULEYMANE

I dont want to tell you

FRANCOIS
You show it in my class so youre going
to tell us what it means

Souleymane hesitates for a second

SOULEYMANE
It says here right here If your words
are less important than silence keep
quiet

BOUBACAR
That’s what I said

SOULEYMANE
No that’s not what you said
BOUBACAR
Hey Rabah isn’t that what I said
SOULEYMANE
No it’s not what you said
FRANCOIS
Why isnt it the same thing that Boubacar
said
SOULEYMANE

I dont know Its different I think it
sounds better

FRANCOIS
Yes its better put Souleymane if only
you could write as interesting things on
paper as on your arm that would be
great

SOULEYMANE
Yeah yeah I think so too

FRANCOIS

That proves you can do it Right after
these first few self-portraits Id like
you to rewrite them and polish them
making sure you answer the questions that
we listed at the start of class what I
like and dont like my qualities and
flaws who Id like to be

INT CLASS - DAY

As the other students leave the classroom Frangois
signals to Carl to wait The boy looks a little worried

FRANCOIS
Welcome

CARL
Thank you

Now that the other students have left Frangois adopts a
more confidential tone

FRANCOIS
I dont know if you know but Im Mr
Marin your French teacher and your class
supervisor So if theres a problem you
talk to me about it I know who you are
I mean I know why youre here The
principal told me but that doesnt

that we Were on self-portraits to be
handed in next Monday Maybe you could do

Carl looks awkward
CARL

CARL
Goodbye
FRANCOIS

Goodbye You know what a self-portrait
is that’s not a problem

CARL
Yes

FRANCOIS

CARL

INT CLASS - NIGHT

One evening after the day’s classes Frangois sitting at

his desk sees the students’ parents one by one

We see a series of portraits of the students’ parents
Some defend their offspring tooth and nail others demand
greater severity with their children and others still
seem totally indifferent to what Frangois has to say

WEY’S PARENTS seem to be concentrating hard and hanging
on Frangois’ every word but the looks on their faces show

that they don’t understand

FRANCOIS
Good evening Pleased to meet you

WEY’S FATHER
Good evening

FRANCOIS

Sit down please Thank you for coming

know it isnt easy Well were very
pleased with Wey Very pleased indeed
(MORE)

I
FRANGOIS (CONTD)
All the teachers at the staff meeting
said so Hes kind hes pleasant Its
good to have him in class And its
showing in his grades We have the usual
good grades in mathematics Hes doing
well there 1320 In French we have a 9
here

WEY’S FATHER
Not a lot

Meanwhile Wey’s mother looks on a big smile on her
face She clearly doesn’t understand what is being said
but has a vague impression that Frangois is speaking
favorably about her son

FRANCOIS
Well he doesnt speak French very well
yet but thats only normal He talks a
lot He tells me about a lot of things
He talks about his computer Hes into
that

WEY’S FATHER
Yes yes always too late

FRANCOIS
You think he works too late

WEY’S FATHER
Yes too late not sleep good After
school not good Eyes get sick after

FRANCOIS
Yes his eyes In any case he may spend
a lot of time on the computer but things
are fine at school for now

WEY’S FATHER
Yes thank you

FRANCOIS
He works well and he doesnt seem tired

WEY’S FATHER
Thank you

Nassim comes next with his FATHER

NASSIM’S FATHER
Nassim Id like him to do He can go
far He has all he needs At his age I
wasnt that lucky Im right behind him
Anything he needs I get him no problem
(MORE)

NASSIM’S FATHER (CONTD)
But he has to do right Its true things
are good at home with him but Id like
him to keep on studying and go far Me
and his mother wed like to be proud of
him Thats what we ask of him

FRANCOIS
I think we all agree on what we need to
do Its crazy how alike you are

NASSIM
Were lookers in the family only
natural

FRANCOIS

Yes youre right
The next parent is ARTHURS MOTHER

ARTHURS MOTHER
So an adolescent who talks with his
family who has good grades who has
friends even if hes a bit of a loner
hes an outcast Hes a boy who talks
with adults who exchanges with them
Maybe he doesnt with you but that means
hes just a teenager trying to define
himself thats all I was useless at
school for years I rejected the idea of
making us fit in with the system Do his
black clothes bother you The way he
looks I dont get it

Then comes Burak’s mother (seen at a meeting earlier)
with her son

BURAK’S MOTHER
Id like him to go to the best to Henri

IV

FRANCOIS
Henri IV Why do you want him to go
there

BURAK’S MOTHER
Because

BURAK
Standards again Henri IV is all she
thinks about

BURAK’S MOTHER
Because they have very high standards A
mother always wants the best for her son

BURAK
Yeah my mothers scared Ill feel lost
in high school because the others went to
fancy private schools and Dolto High
isnt as demanding so

BURAK’S MOTHER
Its a pity that the teachers well
maybe not the teachers I dont want to
accuse anyone but the school

FRANCOIS
Go on accuse us Its always a pleasure

BURAK’S MOTHER
Why dont you try to push the better
students a little harder say They get
bogged down by other students who arent
as good

BURAK
My mom makes stuff up Dolto High isnt
useless She thinks private schools

BURAK’S MOTHER
I didnt say useless I said average I
didnt call it useless

This stream of parents ends with Souleymane’s mother
accompanied by her older son aged 17 or so He is the
one who speaks since his mother doesn’t understand a word
of French

FRANCOIS

We talked about Souleymane a great deal

at the staff meeting Many teachers have
complained about his attitude which is

very negative

Souleymane’s brother immediately becomes heated

SOULEYMANE’S BROTHER
Oh yeah

FRANCOIS

Many complain that he comes without his
things When he comes that is as hes
often absent Hes often late too

SOULEYMANE’S BROTHER
Oh yeah

FRANCOIS
In any case I think you know that
Another conversation in Malian
angry as before starts talking curtly to her son
Frangois looks at them in surprise

SOULEYMANE’S BROTHER
No we didnt know Souleymane tells us
he works hard

A brief conversation with his mother in Malian
Souleymane’s brother becomes annoyed as he translates for
his mother who also starts to get angry

FRANCOIS
Can you translate for me

SOULEYMANE’S BROTHER
She she doesn’t believe it

FRANCOIS
There have been notes in his report book
since September three months now Notes
about the problems he was having

SOULEYMANE’S BROTHER
She signs them without knowing because
she cant read see

FRANCOIS
What about you Do you read the notes
too

SOULEYMANE’S BROTHER
Yes but Im just his brother You see

FRANCOIS
Okay but you knew there was a problem

SOULEYMANE’S BROTHER
No I didnt know Whenever I ask he
says things are fine

FRANCOIS
Do you see him work at home

SOULEYMANE’S BROTHER
He stays in his room so

FRANCOIS
I see

SOULEYMANE’S BROTHER
She says she doesnt understand the notes
in the report book

Souleymane’s mother as

FRANCOIS
Yes I realize that In any case you
know the situation now Im telling you
officially theres a problem You need
to talk to him

SOULEYMANE’S BROTHER
Yes Ill talk to him about it Ill talk
to him about it

FRANCOIS
Well just having a Maybe a conversation
with his father could help too it would
be interesting

SOULEYMANE’S BROTHER
Yes yes Ill see Ill talk to my
father and see what we can do tonight

FRANCOIS
Okay were not settling scores We just
want to improve things

He stands to say goodbye shaking hands with Souleymane’s
mother then with his brother

SOULEYMANE’S BROTHER
Goodbye

FRANCOIS
Goodbye

Another conversation in Malian Souleymane’s mother has
already turned to leave

INT COMPUTER ROOM - DAY

The students wait in the corridor outside the computer
room Souleymane is showing the others some photos on his
cell phone We see views of his apartment and of him
clowning around with his friends His classmates are
impressed by the quality of the photos but start laughing
when they see a photo of Souleymane’s mother
particularly tense and glum in front of the camera

BOUBACAR
Is that your mom

SOULEYMANE
You bet

STUDENT

Shit she’s an ugly old crow

SOULEYMANE
Shut your mouth your mas ugly and so
are you

BOUBACAR

She sulking or what

SOULEYMANE
No she just hates photos Me and my bro
had pissed her off

Frangois comes up discreetly behind them and listens in
on the conversation

FRANCOIS
Lets get started

Boubacar who has noticed Frangois calls out to him
BOUBACAR
Hey sir look Souleymane has brought

photos for his portrait

A little embarrassed Souleymane looks away

SOULEYMANE
Cut it out my photos are crap they
suck

FRANCOIS

Thats good Its a great idea

SOULEYMANE
Get lost you Get your own cell

Frangois opens the door and the students rush over to the
computers

FRANCOIS
Painters do self-portraits Photographers

SOULEYMANE

Yes but too bad Im no painter

FRANCOIS
I know that All right let’s get
started Caps off please Hello

EVA
I spend all my free time playing the
guitar

They are all busy typing up their self-portraits
Souleymane has taken out a cable and crouching under the
table is looking for a free USB connector Frangois is a
little worried

FRANCOIS
If youre typing hurry and finish to let
the others type up their self-portraits
Souleymane dont blow the place up

SOULEYMANE
No no not right away
FRANCOIS
You know what you’re doing
SOULEYMANE
Yeah yeah
FRANCOIS

Well since youre a computer genius you
can put it all back after

SOULEYMANE
Dont worry
FRANCOIS
Im counting on you Everything okay
Carl
CARL
Yes sir

In another corner of the room Carl is typing something
up He doesn’t pay any attention to his classmates who
treat him just as indifferently Frangois comes up behind
him and tries to read over his shoulder Carl immediately
turns his screen away

FRANCOIS
I’m not allowed to see it
CARL
No not yet
ESMERALDA
Sir
FRANCOIS
Yes
ESMERALDA

How do you spell Lafayette

FRANCOIS
How do you mean

ESMERALDA
Like Galeries Lafayette

FRANCOIS
Why are you mentioning that

ESMERALDA
I go there often so I want to add it

FRANCOIS
Thats weird I mean its four metro
stops from here You never usually leave
the neighborhood thats a huge leap in
one go

Khoumba gets annoyed

KHOUMBA
Hey were not hicks
ESMERALDA

FRANCOIS
Really You go into the center of Paris
ESMERALDA
You bet
KHOUMBA

I go everywhere The lst the 5th the
20th the 12th the 19th

FRANCOIS
Really Why do you go to the 5th

KHOUMBA
In the 5th I go to see pals in high
school Near Luxembourg

FRANCOIS
I see You go to the Luxembourg Gardens

KHOUMBA
No not the gardens I said Luxembourg

FRANCOIS
You go to the country called Luxembourg

KHOUMBA
No the Luxembourg metro station
Frangois tries to changed the subject

FRANCOIS

All right So you do get out and about

(a beat)

I see you two have made up That’s good
KHOUMBA

Thats our business
ESMERALDA

And not yours
KHOUMBA

So how do you spell Lafayette
FRANCOIS

Lafayette is L-A-F-A-Y-E-T-T-E With a

capital

All of a sudden things start stirring in Souleymane’s
corner Souleymane has uploaded his photos and more or
less added them to his layout

BOUBACAR

Yeah theyre much better now
SOULEYMANE

Much better
BOUBACAR

She looks good
Frangois comes over and looks at the screen

FRANCOIS
Yes that is a good photo

Souleymane turns to the screen as if to check on what
Frangois is saying

SOULEYMANE
Yeah

FRANCOIS
And now you could add a legend

SOULEYMANE
A legend Meaning

BOUBACAR
Like a story or a tale
FRANCOIS
No not that kind of legend A caption
under the photo like in newspapers

SOULEYMANE

You mean like in Le Parisien
FRANCOIS

Yes like in Le Parisien
SOULEYMANE

Oh right
FRANCOIS

What kind of legend could you put here
Who is this woman

SOULEYMANE
My old woman

FRANCOIS
Meaning

SOULEYMANE
My mother

FRANCOIS

Well you could say shes your mother
Then you could explain why shes making
this gesture of pushing away the
photographer

BOUBACAR
Him and his brother had just pissed her
off

SOULEYMANE
Im not gonna write that

FRANCOIS
So why is she making that gesture

SOULEYMANE
She hates photos

FRANCOIS
So write that My mother hates having
her photo taken Thats a legend see

SOULEYMANE
Yeah yeah

FRANCOIS
Then do that with all the photos and
youre set

SOULEYMANE
Yeah

FRANCOIS
Printed it all out

SOULEYMANE
Yeah yeah I’m all set

FRANCOIS
Great This is perfect

Souleymane’s photos emerge from the printer perfectly
laid out and captioned Frangois goes to pin them to the
wall as Souleymane watches suddenly intimidated

SOULEYMANE
What are you doing now sir

FRANCOIS

As you can see Im putting the photos up
to get a global view The others read out
their self-portraits so youre going to
put yours on show

Souleymane looks more like an intimidated child than
ever

SOULEYMANE

My photos suck you know that
FRANCOIS

Not at all theyre very good
SOULEYMANE

Sure
FRANCOIS

And when a student does good work I let
the whole class see it

SOULEYMANE
Youre just doing this to wind me up

FRANCOIS
No I wind you up if I feel you can do
better This is good

SOULEYMANE
Thats bullshit

FRANGOIS
If youve finished come and take a look
at Souleymanes masterpiece Slowly
Well straighten them after

Souleymane surprised at seeing his “work” on show like
this has the impression that he is naked in front of the
whole class The other students come over (only Carl
continues to work on his text) They all make
enthusiastic comments that Souleymane responds to with a
great deal of false modesty We can tell that he is both
flattered and worried about revealing so much As we hear
the students’ comments the camera shows us Souleymane’s
photos in close-up the members of his family views of
his neighborhood he has often photographed himself too
occasionally in everyday situations but also at times
from a more narcissistic angle with close-ups on his
tattoos

INT STAFF ROOM - DAY

In the staff room Sophie discreetly takes a bottle of
champagne out of her bag and pops it into the small
fridge under the coffee machine Behind her the
conversations are interrupted by the arrival of Julie
the year supervisor who addresses the whole staff

JULIE
Hello I have something to say Could you
listen to me please Rachel I have
something to say The mother of Wey a
student in 43 has been arrested She
was in France illegally She has been
picked up shes in a holding center and
may be tried next week She could be
deported back to China I thought you
should know as its important

CECILE
Thats crazy the familys been here 3
years now

JULIE
Yes I know but thats how it goes wrong
place wrong time The police turn up and
she gets taken in

FREDERIC
What about the father

JULIE
The father doesnt have papers either but
theyre not bothering him for some
reason So what I wanted to suggest to
start with as lawyers cost a lot we
could do a collection and maybe even go
to court to try to have some influence on
the verdict

Julie puts an envelope down on the main table so that
everyone can add his or her contribution Sophie
standing near the fridge looks awkward

FRANCOIS
Will Wey have to leave too

JULIE
Not for now but you never know

A moment’s silence Sophie decides to take the plunge
She takes the bottle out of the fridge

SOPHIE
Well I feel kind of pathetic after that
I had something to tell you but this
isnt a good time

ANNE
Youve said too much now

SOPHIE
Im pregnant

VINCENT
Yeah That calls for a celebration

FREDERIC
Congratulations

The news is greeted with enthusiastic exclamations
Someone takes the bottle from Sophie someone else hands
out plastic cups while Sophie clearly touched by their
reaction sits down as if she were about to give birth
Rachel hands her a glass of champagne

RACHEL
How far gone
SOPHIE
Two months Ill only have a drop Just a

drop
Vincent opens the bottle messily

TEACHER (0S)
Bravo Vincent

SOPHIE
Hes an expert
VINCENT
I didnt do it on purpose Who shook the
bottle
ANNE
Here Sophie
SOPHIE
Thank you
FRANCOIS
Any ideas about names yet If its a boy

SOPHIE
If its a boy Id like to call him
Enguerran
VINCENT
Enguerran
SOPHIE

Yes

TEACHER (0S)
Seriously

FRANCOIS
It’s good to give him a handicap in life
I mean he’ll have plenty of other

advantages

SOPHIE
Thanks a lot I hope not You all have a
glass

VINCENT

Just a second

TEACHERS
Cheers

They all raise their glasses In the midst of this
agitation Sophie looks absent for a second Then she too
raises her glass to make a toast

SOPHIE
Right I have two wishes I have two
wishes My first wish is that Weys mom
can stay in France And my second wish is
that my child will be as intelligent as
Wey Cheers everybody

EXT YARD — DAY

We see a soccer match in the schoolyard Carl seems to
have found his place among his classmates In fact he is
very sure of himself as he plays monopolizing the ball
with a great deal of ease

Souleymane tackles him and make him fall

SOULEYMANE
(to Wey)
Jackie Chan Go for it
(turning to look at Carl)
I didnt do nothing I didnt do nothing
He just fell He came at me I never
touched him

PLAYERS (0S)
Hand Hand Thanks Play Souleymane

SOULEYMANE
Fucking go for it

A few minutes later Carl dodges a tackle by Souleymane
and scores

CARL
What do you say now Mali man

SOULEYMANE
Whats up you Caribbean shit
Motherfucker Let go of me Ill waste
the fucker Caribbean fag Let go of me
Shut your mouth Go blow Thierry Henri
faggot

INT CLASS - DAY

As the class settles down Frangois explains the rules of
the game to them

FRANCOIS
Stand there Talk loud enough for them to
hear and try to convince them Go ahead

Nassim is the first to react He seems genuinely
impatient to express himself He harangues the class with
a hint of provocation in his voice directed at
Souleymane

NASSIM
The Africa Cup of Nations will be
starting soon Im glad Moroccos
playing Its the best team in the world
in my opinion The sick thing is that my
pals the Malians arent playing Its
tough for them They werent good enough
to qualify Morocco would have let them
play on a friendly basis but 4-0 really
hurts

As he speaks Souleymane simply nods his head as if to
say “Go right ahead”

FRANCOIS
What do you mean 4-0

NASSIM
Last time Mali played Morocco they
wasted them 4-0 But the weird thing is
when Mali doesnt play its like all the
Africans here arent African With each
cup they all go crazy but when Mali
doesnt play they keep a low profile
Weird
FRANCOIS
So whether Mali plays in the Africa Cup
of Nations or not the Africans in this
class feel more or less African Okay
Thank you Nassim I get the feeling your
words are directed at your neighbor
Souleymane

SOULEYMANE
Morocco jerks not even on my radar

FRANCOIS
Arthur is next I see you have your
notes just like a politician

ARTHUR
Exactly

FRANCOIS
Well that’s good Speak up Arthur

ESMERALDA
You want a slap

FRANCOIS
Esmeralda let him speak before you judge
him

ARTHUR
I want to defend the way I look because a
lot of people say it sucks

STUDENT (0S)
Right on dude

ARTHUR
I dont dis your clothes so you dont
dis mine Clothes are freedom of speech
I dress how I want you dress how you
want I say nothing to you you say
nothing to me I dress like this to be
different and not follow the others like
sheep

STUDENT (0S)
Youre the sheep here

ARTHUR
I feel better being myself and not being
like others I also think if there were
22 Goths in this class and one guy like
you youd keep quiet then

FRANCOIS
Arthur I think theres a contradiction
in what you say You want to be you But
are those clothes you Those clothes are
worn by a huge number of people

ARTHUR
Most people who wear them are gloomy
inside so were all kind of alike

FRANCOIS
Youre all alike youre all gloomy so
thats not you

ARTHUR
No by being different

FRANCOIS
Youre different and the same Thank you
for taking a stand and being brave enough
to do so
(a beat)
Boubacar go on

ESMERALDA
Boubacar my pal

FRANCOIS
Quiet Listen to him

BOUBACAR
Ive come up to reply to Nassim He says
that since Mali isnt in the Africa Cup
of Nations black Africans have no team
to support But hes forgetting one
country Ivory Coast With an ace player
Didier Drogba Yeah Didier Drogba
Didier Drogba beats any Moroccan He
plays for Chelsea What Moroccan plays in
England Theyre not up to it Im
through

FRANCOIS

Thanks Boubacar I think that
rectification was indeed indispensable
Who wants to speak now Carl go on

CARL
Actually Id like to say theyre
starting to piss us off with this Africa
Cup At break youre there pissing us
off with your cup It hasnt even started
yet

BOUBACAR
Carl Ill be polite with you Sorry to
interrupt but tell me whats your
national team

CARL

ESMERALDA

CARL

BOUBACAR
Why dont you say youre French in that
case Why do you say youre Caribbean

CARL
We are French What’s your problem

BOUBACAR
Why don’t you say

CARL
Our Caribbean islands are French

BOUBACAR
Why dont you ever say youre French
instead of saying your Caribbean

CARL
It’s the same thing

BOUBACAR
No I don’t think so

CARL
Look at the players we have Thierry
Henri Wiltord Abidal Thuram Just look
at them

SOULEYMANE
Where does Diarra play

CARL
Diarra wont ever play in Mali bro hes
not crazy enough

SOULEYMANE
Shut your mouth pal Im telling you Im

FRANCOIS

shot Shut your goddam mouth

FRANCOIS

match Its a debate Souleymane watch

SOULEYMANE

ESMERALDA

Souleymane’s sole reply is to give her the finger

Esmeralda

SOULEYMANE

FRANCOIS
You just cant talk normally can you
Nobody else moves

SOULEYMANE
You calling me an ape Fuck you man

IE STAIRS and YARD - DAY

They slowly come down the stairs Frangois is seething
The teenager drags his feet forcing his teacher to come
back up a few steps from time to time The scene
resembles a silent duel

The crossing of the yard is just as laborious

FRANCOIS
Hurry it up Move it

The teenager stubbornly continues to advance at his own
pace

SOULEYMANE
Hey get your hands off me

FRANCOIS
Arent you sick of assing around

These words have echoed around the yard Frangois then
notices that the other students are pressing to the
windows of the classroom watching them and laughing

Souleymane has noticed them too and stops to do up his
shoelaces just to show off Frangois tries to recover
his calm but we can tell that he is still on edge He
waits patiently for Souleymane After taking his time
doing his laces Souleymane sets off towards the
principals office again

INT PRINCIPALS OFFICE - DAY

Outside the principal

s office they look each other up

and down one last time then Frangois knocks on the door
The principal tells them to come in

Hello

PRINCIPAL

FRANCOIS

Sorry to bother you I have a

troublemake
class

r whos been disrespectful in

Souleymane sits down almost instinctively opposite the

principals desk

PRINCIPAL

I didnt ask you to sit down Souleymane

FRANCOIS

I have to get back to my class sorry

I’1l see to

PRINCIPAL
this

Frangois leaves the room

PRINCIPAL

Sit down now All right Im listening
Will you tell me what happened You think
its normal that a teacher should have to

leave his c
principals

The teenager seems de

INT CLASS MEETING -

Around a table set ou

lass to bring you to the
office

termined to remain silent

DAY

t in a U-shape the class meeting

brings together all the teachers that work with the

class members of the

school’s administration and a

parents representative As for the students they are
represented by Esmeralda and Louise who keep chattering
together in low voices

PRINCIPAL

Results too uneven Too much talking in
class Now lets move on to Louise
present here today
VINCENT
The biggest disaster in the whole class
What can we do with you No good work

PRINCIPAL
Always good Id say

SOPHIE
Excellent and its a joy having a student
like her We have to say so when it
happens

PRINCIPAL
So shall we offer this young lady a
commendation

OLIVIER
Im sorry but I dont totally agree with
you Shes relatively well-placed in the
class from a numerical angle But a
commendation Theres room for progress
huge room for progress and I dont think
her general attitude really merits a
commendation

FRANCOIS

Thats the problem with commendations
Are they purely numerical and
mathematical or are they also to do with
her attitude and behavior as top of the
class

VINCENT
Hold on that means to get a
commendation you have to be an excellent
student and at the same time be a class
leader No

PRINCIPAL
Please please

FRANCOIS
A commendation carries a certain weight

PRINCIPAL
So a commendation this term Louise is
intelligent and will realize she can do
better to satisfy you Now Chérif Our
friend Chérif

HERVE
I have a problem with Chérif Hes a kid
with abilities he could do well

(MORE)

HERVé (CONTD)
I could easily give him 1720 but he
spends so much time talking and
disturbing the class his average grade
is poor And thats a pity

VINCENT
His behaviors irregular He can be a
disaster and you cant do a thing with
him or he can be really good

PRINCIPAL
So what do we put for Chérif A warning
about his work or his behavior

SOPHIE
For me behavior not work

RACHEL
In my class its more his work

PRINCIPAL
Its more like a work problem looking at
his grades Mathematics 6 French 8
History and geography 9 English 95

ESMERALDA
(hurrying out splitting her
sides)
Excuse me

PRINCIPAL
Science 12 Music 11

FRANCOIS
His grades are pretty low but I have the
impression that its more a behavior
problem Why dont we put that for now
and say he can work harder

PRINCIPAL
So Ill put Chérif can succeed as long
as his attitude changes in relation to
his work Lets move on to Souleymane

ANNE
Souleymane Someone else can start

Knowing smiles around the room

PRINCIPAL
What do we say

SOPHIE
Nothing good

PRINCIPAL
What else

FRANCOIS
I think we already discussed him in the
first term We said it all He has huge
weaknesses notably in written French I
dont think theres anything particularly
new this term

Esmeralda comes back in having calmed down

PRINCIPAL
Feeling better Esmeralda

ESMERALDA
Yes

PRINCIPAL

I didnt know being class rep was such
fun We were talking about Souleymane

OLIVIER
In relation to what Frangois just said
he forgot his things most of the time
this term and I have to admit didnt do
much

FREDERIC
But its not just that its way beyond
that Hes more and more unruly He
prevents the others from working

Esmeralda butts in raising her hand to speak

ESMERALDA
May I say something

PRINCIPAL
Yes Esmeralda if you put the biscuits
away Remember you arent allowed to eat
in a classroom

ESMERALDA
Well his overall grade has gone from
675 to 725 So

PRINCIPAL
Yes but were not discussing his grades
but his behavior for now

VINCENT
I have the impression we need to consider
disciplinary action His attitudes

wrong
ANNE
Its simple Every other class I throw
him out
PATRICK

I dont even throw him out anymore Hes
only too happy when I do so it makes no
sense

FRANCOIS
I dont think disciplinary action will
help because things will get really bad
then

FREDERIC
Theyre already really bad Its gone too
far Its like hes mad at the others for
being normal students

PRINCIPAL
Ill remind you Mr Marin you brought
him to me only yesterday

FRANCOIS
Yes but it was this years first
incident He was disrespectful so I had
to set a limit I did what I did but I
dont think it will go any further than
that Since the start of the year I
dont have any real complaints apart
from yesterday

FREDERIC
But our job isnt to make sure students
sit quietly at the back and dont cause
any trouble We have to bring these kids
out

Esmeralda and Louise are amused by this lively discussion
between two of their teachers The principal looks as if
he wants to take things in hand

FRANCOIS
I wont do that with threats or
punishment Id rather stress his good
work because some things interest him He
can come out with some pretty good stuff

FREDERIC
Simply because he does something positive
now and then we let him sink and wallow
in his hole and we do nothing You just
want to buy social harmony

PRINCIPAL
That said what do we say What do we do
A warning

FRANCOIS
I dont think a warnings what he needs
Maybe we should say Souleymane has
reached his limit because hes limited
scholastically

ESMERALDA (0S)
Shit that’s tough He shouldn’t say a
thing like that

Esmeralda and Louise pretend to be shocked by Frangois’
words but burst out laughing

PRINCIPAL
Okay thats all well and good but Im
dim and have a line to fill What do we
put

Frédéric and Frangois remain silent

INT CLASS - DAY

FRANCOIS
Three rhymes three rhymes per verse
What do you call that Verses of three
lines Wey

WEY
A tercet

FRANCOIS
A tercet very good And if there were
four rhymes Wey what would it be

WEY
A quatrain

FRANCOIS
A quatrain its easy From “quatre”
four Tercet three rhymes Quatrain
four How many syllables per line Can
you tell me that Khoumba

KHOUMBA
I know there are ten
FRANCOIS
You know there are ten
KHOUMBA
Want me to show you
FRANCOIS
Yes
KHOUMBA

“Noir dans la neig-e et dans la brum-e”
That makes ten

FRANCOIS
If you say “Noir dans la neig-e et dans
la brum-e” you have two extra syllables
by counting the mute Es Dont count
them theyre mute “Noir dans la neige
et dans la brume” that makes eight If
we count precisely underlining each

syllable we have ils 6-coutent - Ill
come back to that one - two
octosyllables

In the middle of the lesson Rabah suddenly speaks out to
talk about the previous day’s class meeting

RABAH
Sir there’s a problem

FRANCOIS
wand one four-syllable line What is it

RABAH
1147 that makes 115

FRANCOIS
Is 1147 the number of syllables here

RABAH
Rounded up I mean No it’s my grade
It’s down

FRANCOIS
Can you tell me what that has to do with
poetry

RABAH

They lowered my grade 1147 is 115

FRANCOIS
Who gave you your grade You shouldnt
have it yet not until you get your
reports

RABAH
Esmeralda told me

FRANCOIS
Ah So the class reps did do something
after all they passed on the grades

LOUISE
Are you kidding I took a load of notes

FRANCOIS
I got the impression you werent really
following the meeting

Louise brandishes a book full of notes

LOUISE
Hey I wrote all this

FRANCOIS
Louise Im delighted Youve done a good
job passing on information Lets get
back to this poem The rule is to count
in front of a consonant and not in front
of a

The two girls look at each other outraged
As Frangois finishes writing a poem on the board

Souleymane who doesn’t want to leave things at this
butts in

SOULEYMANE

Sir sir I have a question
FRANCOIS

What
SOULEYMANE

I heard you really wiped me out at the
meeting yesterday

FRANCOIS
Another remark about poetry I see

SOULEYMANE
No Im not talking about poetry

FRANCOIS
Yes I know youre not talking about
poetry What do you mean wiped you
out

SOULEYMANE
I dunno You wiped me out

FRANCOIS
Some people not me said if you carry on
like this Some teachers said if you
carry on like this youll be in trouble
not wiped out

SOULEYMANE
Yeah but thats revenge I dont get it
Why do all the teachers go for revenge

FRANCOIS
What do you mean What does it have to do
with revenge

SOULEYMANE
If you say stuff about me getting in
trouble and all thats revenge right

FRANCOIS

Revenge has nothing to do with it
SOULEYMANE

What do you mean it’s not revenge
FRANCOIS

Not at all
SOULEYMANE

It is it’s revenge

FRANCOIS
Were not on the streets here Its a
warning Our goal isnt revenge its
discipline Get the difference

SOULEYMANE
I dont get it

FRANCOIS
When a judge sends someone to jail he
doesnt do it to get revenge Its to
help society run smoothly

SOULEYMANE
I call it revenge you just want to get
revenge Youre riffed with me

FRANCOIS
Are you out of your mind You think all I
care about is revenge I wake up and say
Ill get Souleymane today

Esmeralda reacts immediately

ESMERALDA
You say you have other things to do but
you insulted him yesterday anyhow He
really laid into you

FRANCOIS
No I didn’t absolutely not

ESMERALDA
What was it he said Louise

Louise checks her notes and turns to Souleymane

LOUISE
He said you were limited I underlined
it I was so shocked

Souleymane is slightly dazed by this remark He seems
humiliated that such words should have emerged before the
whole class

SOULEYMANE
I’m what I’m limited

Frangois startled that Souleymane’s feelings may have
been hurt focuses his anger on the two girls

FRANCOIS
Brilliant brilliant Esmeralda and
Louise whats your role as class reps
exactly You represent the students to
help this class work or you stir up
trouble between me and the students What
do you do exactly

LOUISE
We just do our job that’s all

ESMERALDA
Wicked We report on the meeting

FRANCOIS
Yes of course I didnt realize When I
saw you sniggering at the meeting like
that I felt bad you see I felt bad for
you

(MORE)
FRANGOIS (CONTD)
It wasnt the place or time to do that
It didnt look very serious quite
frankly okay

ESMERALDA
Yeah well nobody minded in any case
FRANCOIS
Oh yes they did
ESMERALDA
Only you
FRANCOIS

No no Esmeralda it bothered me and I
think I can say it bothered the others
too

ESMERALDA
No no it only bothered you

FRANCOIS
Sorry but laughing like that in the
middle of a class meeting made you look
like two skanks

LOUISE
What

Reactions from the class

ESMERALDA
Have you just lost it

STUDENT (0S)

That’s bad
LOUISE
Sir you cant dump on your students
FRANCOIS
The word is insult
ESMERALDA
Have you lost it insulting on us as
skanks
FRANCOIS

No no you say dump on or insult
Its either one or the other okay

ESMERALDA
Yeah keep on talking

FRANCOIS

In fact I never said you were skanks I
said that at one point in the meeting you
acted like skanks Understand

CARL
Hey sir dont try to con us you said
skanks Thats too easy

FRANCOIS

No no Im not trying to con you I
just explaining the difference You
understand what I mean

m

CARL
No no I don’t understand

Souleymane who has been seething since the start of the
discussion suddenly explodes

SOULEYMANE
Sir you dont talk to girls like that
What are you thinking of

FRANCOIS

Hey youre going to tell us how to talk
to girls the way you talk to others You
always insult everybody

SOULEYMANE
He wants revenge The old teach is no use
now he wants revenge on the girls

FRANCOIS
No way The noble knight riding to the
girls’ rescue wont wash Souleymane

SOULEYMANE
You dont talk to me man You dont talk
to me like that wacko

FRANCOIS
I told you before show some respect for
your teachers

SOULEYMANE
I will if I want

FRANCOIS
I told you youre heading for trouble
unless you show some respect

SOULEYMANE
Think youre tough

FRANCOIS
It’s not about toughness it’s about
discipline and respect

SOULEYMANE
Ill take you anytime man

Souleymane starts putting his things away to avoid
looking Frangois in the eye

KHOUMBA
Hey cut it out stop playing the big
shot Calm down Stop playing the big
shot

SOULEYMANE
Stay outta this

BOUBACAR
Souleymane cut it out bro

Fearing that a fight is about to break out Frangois
hurries over

SOULEYMANE
Hey dont touch me

FRANCOIS
Youre crazy You cant just walk out of
my class Are you nuts

Souleymane stands kicking over his chair that crashes to
the floor and walks over to the door As he passes Carl
roughly grabs his arm

CARL
Calm down calm down
SOULEYMANE
Let go of me
FRANCOIS

Stop it now Enough Where are you going

SOULEYMANE
I said let go of me fucker

FRANCOIS
Pathetic

To break free of Carl’s grip Souleymane tries to hit him
with his bag He miscalculates and strikes Khoumba’s
head She screams as she lifts her hand to her eyebrow
that starts bleeding

KHOUMBA
Fuck

Souleymane goes out as Khoumba’s blood forms a puddle on
the floor at her feet

INT STAFF ROOM - DAY

Close-up on a sheet of paper on which Frangois starts
writing “Incident report April 11 2008” Frangois is
alone in a corner of the deserted staff room He writes
few words then breaks off reads what he has just
written and puts his pen down

INT PRINCIPALS OFFICE - DAY

The principal reads the report attentively as Francois
watches in concern When he finishes reading the
principal remains silent for a second

PRINCIPAL
So what do we do I think we need to
convene the disciplinary committee dont
we This is starting to add up It begins
with disrespect then the fight with a
student injured and finally he leaves
the class without permission

FRANCOIS
Yes but there was only one incident and
it all spread out from there One thing
led to another a chain reaction

The principal stands and concludes

PRINCIPAL

Well what I can do is take a protective
measure since this is so serious by
suspending Souleymane for 48 hours
Thatll give us a little time to reach a
decision Shall we do that However I
need to see you tomorrow Could you come
to my office That would be better

FRANCOIS
Goodbye

PRINCIPAL
Goodbye

Frangois leaves the room

a

INT CORRIDOR and STAIRS - DAY

At the door of the office Julie the year supervisor is
waiting for him

JULIE
Frangois I need a word with you Theres
a rumor going around

They continue their conversation as they head along the
corridor to the yard

FRANCOIS
A rumor

JULIE
Yes Some students came to see me and
told me you insulted them in class

FRANCOIS
Who told you that Louise and Esmeralda
was it

JULIE

They told me you called them skanks and
that led to the incident with Souleymane

FRANCOIS
And you go right ahead and believe them

JULIE
Yes well no Thats why I needed to see
you You didnt mention it in your
incident report so yes I wanted to
know

FRANCOIS
I didnt mention it because I didnt
mention it What can I say

JULIE
Did you do it or not
FRANCOIS
What
JULIE
Did you
(she greets someone who
passes)

Did you call them skanks

FRANCOIS
Yes but Souleymanes another matter

JULIE
I know it had nothing to do with him But
words getting around People are
talking I wanted to let you know

FRANCOIS
Well thanks for letting me know

Frangois has spoken absently because out of the window
he has just spotted Esmeralda in the yard

EXT YARD

— DAY

Frangois hurries across the yard towards Esmeralda as if
he were ready for a fight

FRANCOIS
Hey you two You complained about me to
the year supervisor Thanks a lot

They step away from the other students Esmeralda caught

off guard

stammers a little

ESMERALDA
You’re welcome

FRANCOIS
You could have talked to me about it
couldn’t you

Louise comes over to her friend and joins the
conversation

LOUISE
When a teacher complains about us he
sees the year supervisor we can do the
same thing right

FRANCOIS
No it doesnt work both ways

He has raised his voice A group has formed around them
We notice that Khoumba has a dressing over her eyebrow

LOUISE
Of course it’s the same Of course it is

FRANCOIS
Absolutely not What were you after by
doing this

ESMERALDA
We wanted to see you punished like us

FRANCOIS
To see me punished
ESMERALDA
Yes
FRANCOIS
Youre going to get me punished
ESMERALDA
Yes you insulted us you get punished
FRANCOIS
And where will that get you me being
punished
ESMERALDA
At least Ill have spoken out
FRANCOIS
Great thats a lot of use
ESMERALDA
I mean do you even know what skank
means
FRANCOIS

Thats not the problem because I never
called you skanks

ESMERALDA
Yes you did you called us skanks For
me skank means prostitute

FRANCOIS
Not at all

ESMERALDA
It does

FRANCOIS

For me it doesnt mean that Its
nothing important at all just a girl
laughing stupidly It’s no worse than
that

Esmeralda turns to the circle of girls around her

ESMERALDA
Hey skank means prostitute right

GIRLS
You bet

KHOUMBA
Will Souleymane get expelled

Frangois is caught off his guard

FRANCOIS
Of course not but

KHOUMBA
Will he get a disciplinary hearing

FRANCOIS
We dont know yet Its a possibility
Stop yelling before anythings decided

KHOUMBA
Its all settled anyway We know that

FRANCOIS
It isn’t Why do you say that

KHOUMBA
Because It’s always the same

ESMERALDA
Is always the same

FRANCOIS
You know youre in no position to talk
Youre the one who got hurt during the
incident

KHOUMBA
So He didnt mean it There was a metal
thing in his bag

FRANCOIS
Whatever happened he blew a fuse and
thats bad
Carl butts in
CARL

Sir anyone can blow a fuse

FRANCOIS
Yes they can but they can calm down
after too

CARL
That’s not so sure

FRANCOIS
You calmed down right
CARL

FRANCOIS
Youre a lot calmer since you got here

CARL
No I haven’t calmed down You don’t know
me better than I know myself

FRANCOIS
All the teachers say your attitude is
perfect now So dont try to pretend
otherwise

CARL
So what’s the idea You think youve
tamed me

FRANCOIS
No it doesnt mean weve tamed you But
being sent here by a disciplinary
committee helped you understand things
see

CARL
It didnt help me I dont understand
your shit

FRANCOIS
In making that decision about you maybe
your old teachers wanted to help you and
well do the same for Souleymane

CARL
Sorry but I say teachers who expel
students are fuckers

ESMERALDA
Right on

FRANCOIS
Bravo you want to repeat that

CARL
Yeah they’re fuckers

FRANCOIS
This is incredible Everyone goes wild
over some word I said You say fucker and
I shouldnt react

CARL
I don’t give a damn they’re fuckers

FRANCOIS
Cut it out

ESMERALDA
Hey You say skanks we say fucker You
may not like it but its the same Its
the same

FRANCOIS
First of all the two words are nothing
alike And if you cant understand that a
teacher can say certain things that
students cant say well Well never get
anywhere

KHOUMBA
We’re not allowed to say nothing We’re
not allowed to say nothing

FRANCOIS
Rubbish You keep talking all the time
You never stop speaking

CARL
Whenever we talk you yell What is this

FRANCOIS
Enough

Frangois at a loose end leaves the group

INT HALLWAY - CANTEEN - DAY

As he enters the canteen hallway Khoumba catches up with
him She is alone and looks worried

KHOUMBA
Sir Sir
FRANCOIS
What
KHOUMBA
Tell me will Souleymane get a hearing or
not

Frangois surprised by the emotion in Khoumba’s voice
turns to look at her

FRANCOIS
Give it a rest You sound like you want
him to It fires you up

KHOUMBA
Do you know whatll happen if hes
expelled

FRANCOIS

Hell change schools

KHOUMBA
No he wont change schools

FRANCOIS
He will its automatic Its obligatory
That goes for Souleymane too

KHOUMBA
Do you know his father

FRANCOIS
Ive seen him once or twice

KHOUMBA
No you don’t know him If Souleymane is
expelled his dadll send him back to
their village

FRANCOIS
Dont get overdramatic

KHOUMBA
Hell go back to Mali

FRANCOIS
I think we all need to keep our heads
here Its okay dont worry

He walks away

INT CANTEEN - DAY

Frangois comes into the deserted canteen There are trays
on the tables the leftovers of lunch He sits down in a
corner He looks a little lost

We find him a little later smoking a cigarette as two
WOMEN clear the trays away at the other end of the room
putting them on a trolley On reaching him one of them
points to Frangois’ cigarette

CLEANING WOMAN
You cant smoke here sir

FRANCOIS
Yes I know but since I was alone

CLEANING WOMAN
The rules hold for everyone

Frangois puts out his cigarette in a dirty plate The
woman takes the tray glaring at him

INT STAFF ROOM - DAY

Frangois is with the other teachers talking about
Souleymane Frédéric speaks up

FREDERIC
Okay you went too far with those girls
But we all screw up It doesnt excuse
what Souleymane did

RACHEL

Listen Frangois hes right I saw
Khoumba Her face was all bloody What he
did is unacceptable

SOPHIE
That’s for sure

FRANCOIS

Thats another thing her bloody face
His bag hit her by accident A split
eyebrow bleeds a lot Thats all

SOPHIE
You can’t ignore it

HERVE
Come on Frangois dont take it to
heart Youve seen how they talk to us

FRANCOIS
Hows that relevant Souleymane is going
to get a disciplinary hearing and hell
be expelled

SOPHIE
Thats kind of logical

FRANCOIS
So lets talk about that How many
hearings were there last year Twelve at
least

RACHEL
Not that many

SOPHIE
Yes he could be right

FRANCOIS
I know Im on the committee so I saw
them all An average of two a month
twelve in all with an expulsion each
time

HERVE
Come on the hearing is where we talk
things over Okay so twelve students
were expelled but maybe there was no
other solution

RACHEL
Twelve out of twelve means there wasnt
much of a discussion unfortunately

FREDERIC
But twelve out of twelve just means when
a student has a hearing its too late

SOPHIE
Or that it was justified

FRANCOIS
Okay things happen that lead to a
hearing But then what happens What do
we expect from a hearing

PATRICK
There are all the prior stages You know
that Frangois The pre-disciplinary
committees we inform the parents the
students are warned

RACHEL
Not in this case

SOPHIE
We’ve no time to

ANNE
It’s pretty rare

FRANCOIS
Its rare because we know we have this
ultimate punishment that allows us to
ignore the prior steps And even if we
did use them the simple fact of
expelling a student I dont know its a
disavowal of everything we have tried

HERVE
Okay but at the same time its
Souleymanes chance to justify himself

SOPHIE
Sure Students at hearings dont speak
Theyre scared Theyre paralyzed

Frangois then decides to use what Khoumba told him

FRANCOIS
Exactly Let me sum this up Hell get a
disciplinary hearing hell be expelled
and maybe even sent back to Mali

ANNE
Youre being overdramatic

FRANCOIS
No Im not Students who know him better
than any of us here who know his father
say that he is likely to send him back to
Mali after this

PATRICK
Some kids are threatened with boarding
school but it never happens

ANNE
It can happen

FREDERIC
Come on a lot of parents spend their
time threatening their kids with that
But you cant take it into account

FRANCOIS
Even if there’s just a slight risk that a
hearing could lead to him being sent
back I dont think I can take that risk
Thats all

SOPHIE
Its like when you hesitate over
punishing a kid because when he goes
home once that door closes hell get a
beating from his parents Weve all seen
that But we still have to punish them
when they go too far Whatever the
consequences which dont concern you
FRANCOIS
So I ignore that I know punishment can
have such a consequence but I turn a
blind eye I dont want to know is that
it

SOPHIE
No but I understand

HERVE
Hold on a second You cant take it into
account in every case or you wont get
anywhere The violence him being sent
back True you have to consider it but
after a while

SOPHIE
No more Christmas presents It happens
yes

FREDERIC

Afterwards its a question of principle
We each have a role to play We cant
substitute ourselves for the parents

FRANCOIS
Sorry but if I rewind the movie its a
weird chain of events It starts with
reprimands when Souleymane starts
screwing up forgets his things or talks
back We punish him Again and again
until a disciplinary hearing leading to
who knows what Little by little
everything gets out of hand

FREDERIC
Sure if you look at it that way its
really shocking But once again the
school wont be expelling Souleymane
Hes been gone for a while

INT CORRIDOR - DAY

Frangois leaves the staff room He walks along the
corridor thinking

EXT YARD — DAY

The students start to form into their classes as they
continue to horse about in the yard

INT PRINCIPALS OFFICE - DAY

Frangois knocks on the door and comes in The principal
doesn’t seem to be very surprised to see him

PRINCIPAL
Frangois I didnt expect you so soon
Have you reached a decision

FRANCOIS
Well I dont think I really have much
choice

He sits down a little heavily on the chair facing the
principal He doesnt say a word The principal goes on
in a kindly voice

PRINCIPAL
By the way Julie told me you had a
heated exchange with two girls in your

class

FRANCOIS
Yes the two class reps but it happened
first so

PRINCIPAL

You apparently called them skanks

FRANCOIS
Lets say that yes

PRINCIPAL
Well that complicates things but the
problem remains Id like you to mention
it in your report I dont want it used
against us at the disciplinary hearing
Dont bother hiding it just write it
down

FRANCOIS
I understand

PRINCIPAL
Ill let you go back over this before we
launch the procedure

FRANCOIS
So I I just need to add the

PRINCIPAL
Yes yes but without going into detail
Does that suit you

Frangois shows no reaction

FRANCOIS
Okay

INT STAFF ROOM - DAY

Frangois alone in the staff room again rewrites his
incident report

INT MEETING ROOM - DAY

The tables have been set out in a U-shape in the meeting
room The people come in

PARENTS’ REPS
Hello Hello sir

PRINCIPAL
Please sit down

Souleymane and his mother sit on one side with the two
student representatives The teaching staff sits on
another side and the parents’ representatives on the
third side of the U

Frangois remains silent and tries in vain to catch
Souleymane’s eye The boy stubborn stares at the
principal who leads the debate sitting between Julie
the class supervisor and the bursar Monsieur Pierre

PRINCIPAL
(to Julie)
Can you take the minutes

We fast-forward to the heart of the meeting as the
principal reads from Frangois’ report

PRINCIPAL
Carl tried to reason with him and stop
him Souleymane broke free swinging his
bag that hit Khoumba in the face Then he
left insulting everyone and slamming the
door I didnt go after him because I
needed to help Khoumba whose eyebrow was
bleeding Those are the facts that led
to todays hearing Madame it doesnt
mean Souleymane is a bad boy Thats not
what were saying

(MORE)
PRINCIPAL (CONTD)

But sometimes a student in a class
through voluntary or involuntary
behavior can create an atmosphere that
prevents the class from working and
getting ahead

(Souleymane translates)
Do you understand what were saying

FREDERIC
If I may say something its true that
there had been a number of signs that
should have warned us We could have
reacted sooner But now we have to deal
with an incident that is fairly violent
and thats simply unacceptable Id like
to know if you realize that Souleymane

SOPHIE
You see were not saying youre
deliberately violent The problem is you
cant control what you say and what you
do

PRINCIPAL
Souleymane wed like to hear you Youre
here to express your point of view Go
ahead

SOULEYMANE
I dont give a damn Ive got nothing to
say Do whatever you want to do

His mother says something in Malian She seems to be
telling him off for his aggressive reaction to the
teachers’ accusations

PRINCIPAL
Excuse me

Souleymane’s mother continues to speak in Malian

SOPHIE
Can you translate

SOULEYMANE
She says Im a good boy I do my
homework I help my brothers and sisters
with their work when I can I always wash
the dishes and help her when I can

PRINCIPAL
Madam we dont doubt that Souleymane is
a good son Thats not the problem Id
like to get back to his school record

PARENTS’ REP 1
Excuse me but could we focus on the
facts here Firstly Id like to say that
were surprised to see the teacher
involved in the incident on this
committee We find that highly irregular

BURAK’S MOTHER

(another parents’ rep

Its true Its odd to be both judge and
litigant

PRINCIPAL
First of all Mr Marin was elected to
the administrative board as the teachers
representative Moreover I think that
the incident that occurred in Mr Marins
class doesnt involve the teacher
directly

PARENTS’ REP 1
Im sorry but you mention some harsh
words spoken by the teacher Apparently
if I understand rightly you used the
word skanks to describe the class reps
And thats a problem

FRANCOIS

I did say that but it wasnt something
that concerned Souleymane I think he
used the excuse of a rather heated
exchange with those two students to
express the bad mood he was in that day

PARENTS’ REP 1
He tried to defend them So I feel that
its relevant

Frangois awkward prefers not to reply while Frédéric
annoyed answers for him

FREDERIC
Im sorry but absolutely nothing
justifies being disrespectful to a
teacher insulting everyone and leaving a
class without permission

PRINCIPAL
Souleymane do you have anything to say

SOULEYMANE
I dont know What can I say

SOULEYMANE’S MOTHER
Sir madame

She then continues in Malian

SOPHIE
Souleymane

PRINCIPAL
What did your mother say

SOULEYMANE
The same thing as before

His mother says something else in Malian

PRINCIPAL
Yes Souleymane

SOULEYMANE
She apologizes on my behalf

INT CORRIDOR - DAY

Souleymane and his mother sit down on a bench in the
corridor They don’t speak or even look at each other

INT MEETING ROOM - DAY

In the meeting room the vote is under way Everyone
taking part in the meeting drops a small piece of paper
into a box that is passed around Everyone is silent

INT CORRIDOR and MEETING ROOM - DAY

The year supervisor comes to fetch Souleymane and his
mother who are still in the same position

JULIE
You can come back in now

They stand and follow her into the room As soon as they
sit down the principal starts speaking

PRINCIPAL
Madame the committee has conferred and
has decided to expel Souleymane from the
school for good You will receive the
ruling by registered mail and have eight
days to appeal We shall do our best to
find Souleymane another school

Souleymane translates for his mother who stands and picks
up her bag

SOULEYMANE’S MOTHER
Goodbye sir madame

Souleymane too stands and goes out with looking back as
the principal continues to address him

PRINCIPAL
Souleymane come to see me before the end
of the week please

EXT YARD — DAY

Souleymane and his mother cross the yard to the exit
From the window Frangois watches them go

INT CLASS - DAY

For the students’ final class the atmosphere is relaxed
We can sense that the tension of the year has eased The
students are like actors after a show

Frangois invites the students to weigh up the past year
what they have learned what they particularly liked

LOUISE
Mathematical proportionality

FRANCOIS
This year you learned mathematical
proportionality All right

BURAK
I liked science

FRANCOIS
What you learned not what you liked If
you liked it you learned So what did
you learn in science

BURAK
All about volcanoes earthquakes plates
Convergence and divergence movement of
the Earths plates It was fascinating

FRANCOIS
It interested you

BURAK
Yeah
FRANCOIS
Thats good

BOUBACAR
Well in mathematics trigonometry
Pythagoras theorem Thalés theorem

FRANCOIS
Ill stop you there You cant sit there
and brag you learned Pythagoras theorem
Recite it for us

ESMERALDA

This remark elicits laughter from the students who were
starting to get bored with this discussion about

Socrates

There’s an air of reconciliation in the air

The ringing of the bell creates a mood of general
euphoria that Frangois calms down

FRANCOIS
Wait a second Before you leave here are
your self-portraits One by one When you
have yours you can go Each one of you
in turn

As an end-of-year gift he hands out the book of self-
portraits that he has had bound The students are over
the moon as they look for their own texts A moment of
intense pride Khoumba leafs through the pages of
Souleymane’s photos in silence

KHOUMBA

dares to approach her teacher

plenty of time to think about your
future Vocational school isnt an

absolute certainty It all depends on how

With what she hopes is a discreet gesture she dries her

tears

She goes out leaving Frangois alone and a little sad

HENRIETTE
But I dont want to

EXT YARD — DAY

In the yard we find the students teachers and members
of the administrative staff caught up in a soccer match
The adolescents are virtually hysterical at the idea of
tackling their teachers

CROWD
(shouting during the game)
Go All together All together
INT CLASS - DAY

The final shot shows the empty classroom then fades to
black
