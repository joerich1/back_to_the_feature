Written by

Noah Baumbach

INT TRAIN CAR - DAY

A cashier hands a boy 13 his change across a counter The
boy stuffs the coins in his pocket He lifts the cardboard
tray with two hot dogs a bag of chips and two Cokes This
is Claude

We follow him He carefully carries the meal down the aisle
balances it in one hand as he opens the door

The train noise blares as he traverses the area between cars

He enters the new car repeating the balancing act He waits
while a man shoves his back-pack onto the metal rack above

the seats Claude hurries a bit more now his concentration
alternating between the food and the path

He sits next to a brunette woman He hands her a hot dog

CLAUDE
Here

Hes met by a severe and pinched face The eyes have black
circles -- there is a scar above her lip Claude instantly
blushes and mumbles

CLAUDE
Sorry

He gets up and hurries a few seats further He slides next
to a pretty brunette woman late 30s with straight shoulder
length hair Her name is Margot

MARGOT
That was quick

CLAUDE
I sat next to the wrong person
MARGOT
Really Where

She stretches up and peers over the seats He grabs her
shirt
CLAUDE
Please dont look Shell see you
MARGOT

Careful with my blouse

Cut TO

Margot is sleeping her head against the window Claude
listens to his iPod He takes out the earphones gets up
and walks to the front of the car Opens the door and goes
between cars

The train roars and screeches Claude screams He stops
looks around He screams again

Cut TO

Claude and his mother gaze out the dirt streaked window at a
river An old castle-like structure emerges from the water

Houses are run-down In the distance theres a power plant
Electrical lines crisscross the sky Claude puts his finger
against the glass and traces the wires

CLAUDE
Will the wedding be crowded

MARGOT
I dont know I think she doesnt
know anyone anymore

CLAUDE
How long has she known Malcolm

MARGOT
Only a year

CLAUDE
Is that short

MARGOT
(pointedly)
Would you marry someone youd only
known a year
CLAUDE
Im not going to ever get married
MARGOT
I cant say I have a lot of hope
for the whole thing
CLAUDE
Why are we going then

MARGOT
Were supporting her

CLAUDE
I thought she wasnt speaking to
you
MARGOT
NonoI wasnt speaking to her

but Im over it
EXT FERRY DOCK - DAY

A ferry is docked Cars pull up onto the boat Margot runs
clutching a suitcase holding down a floppy wine colored sun
hat Claude hurries alongside her a bag slung over his
shoulder

EXT FERRY - DAY

The rumbling and sputtering of the boat People get out of
their cars and stretch their legs

Claude leans against the rail and lets the spray hit his
face Margots cell vibrates The caller ID HOME She
stuffs the phone in her pocket

MARGOT
Why arent you wearing your new
shades

CLAUDE
I dont think I need them right
now

MARGOT

You begged for those glasses

CLAUDE
I know butI will wear them I
just feel like people might think
its weird that a kid is wearing
dark shades
MARGOT
Thats ridiculous
Claude reluctantly takes out a pair of thin wrap-around punk
sunglasses and puts them on He looks around self-
consciously
MARGOT
You look very cool
He takes them off

CLAUDE
I dont need them right now

CUT TO
Margot and Claude wait The ferry has emptied out

CLAUDE
Do they know were here

A maroon Volvo station wagon peels around a bend and stops
across the road Two eyes peer out from just below the
backseat window A man 40 in dumpy cargo shorts rolls down
the window He has a small moustache -- hes harried and
sweaty This is Malcolm He points at Margot and Claude

MALCOLM
Are you

INT VOLVO - DAY

Malcolm drives He smokes with the window open Margot is

in the passenger seat In the back Claude and the girl
Ingrid sit shyly their hair blows turbulently in the wind
Ingrid 11 wears shorts sandals and a batik shirt with a
panda on it

MALCOLM
Paul apologizes for not coming
shes still getting the house
ready

MARGOT
Im sorry it was such short notice

MALCOLM
I dont care Pauls frantic but
I dont give a shit Oh and
Ingrid wants me to tell you that

INGRID
(embarrassed)

Malcolm holds up his wrist and shows a knit blue and orange
bracelet

MALCOLM

INGRID
Theyre not Knicks colors

CLAUDE
They might come later

MARGOT
Joshs spring break is next week
Jim teaches through Friday and then
they open the house in Vermont on
the weekend

MALCOLM
(bluntly)
It means a lot to Pauline that
youre here
Margot nods awkwardly -- she blushes
MARGOT
Oh Good
A car suddenly pulls out of a driveway but nowhere near
their car Malcolm swerves anyway

MALCOLM
Holy Jesus Watch it dicksack
Ingrid giggles Margot clutches the handle above the door
MALCOLM
If youre wondering about the
moustache --
MARGOT

No I wasnt

MALCOLM
I had a full beard for a while and
then when I shaved it I left this
part for last you know to see how

it looked and Its meant to be
funny
Margot nods politely The sound of tires on gravel

8 EXT HOUSE - DAY

The trunk slams shut The Volvo is parked in a driveway
alongside a grey Colonial house that sits above the water
They lift bags An old mutt ambles toward them

Pauline emerges from the house Shes pretty like her
sister late 30s She walks briskly toward them Margot
smiles and opens her arms but Pauline passes her and dips
down to embrace Claude She kisses him on the lips

PAULINE
Youre so handsome

Now she hugs Margot They both tear up Claude beams

PAULINE
I never thought Id get you here

A loud thud They all turn toward the property fence A

large pile of dead flowers and rotting plants has been dumped
into their yard Theres whispering and movement through
brush on the other side Margot looks at Pauline with
concern
PAULINE
Youre arriving in the midst of a
drama Ingrid make sure Wizard is
inside
Malcolm trudges over to the trash cans
INGRID
Its the Voglers

PAULINE
The neighbors want us to cut down
our tree

She indicates a large oak that extends up and into the
adjoining property

MARGOT
No thats our tree

INGRID
They think its sick and rotting
their property

PAULINE
Were having the ceremony under it

MARGOT
You took the swing down

MALCOLM
Pauline thinks this is their way of
trying to be friends I think they
resent us because were

He searches for the word but cant come up with anything
He says wearily

MALCOLM
I dont know what we are

Malcolm strums his guitar and smokes Pauline sits at his
feet with Ingrid and Claude The kids look at a record
sleeve Margot is curled up on the sofa writing in a little
brown notebook She wears oval tortoise-shell glasses

MARGOT
I cant believe youve still got
all of our old records
Ingrid pulls an album toward her Her eyes widen at the
scary image on the cover She quickly turns it over and
hands it to her mother

INGRID
Mom can you hide this please

Pauline puts the record sleeve on top of a shelf

PAULINE
(for Margots benefit)
Malcolm played with Ric Ocasek

disappointment So ultimately Id

PAULINE
Claude ignore him

Pauline sneaks a look at Margot who is watching Malcolm with
an expression of either contempt or confusion Pauline grows
uncomfortable She says to Claude

Tears stream

Malcolm Pauline Margot Claude and Ingrid sit with a

homosexual couple Alan 40s and Toby 30s

Mick Mars

MARGOT
Toby I think you need to have
Bruce diagnosed

TOBY
Margot I dont want to have this
conversation with you

We follow the kids inside We hear in the background

MARGOT
Its vital If you keep telling
him hes like everyone else hell
wonder why he isnt Hes
suffering

TOBY
Hes tested very well He does Bs
in school
Claude stops -- his mother and Toby are arguing out the
window Her eyes meet his for a second -- they make no
connection -- she goes back to Toby
MARGOT

But thats how autism works One
part of the brain can work fine
while the other is damaged

ALAN
We had him diagnosed Margot
Nothing was found wrong

MARGOT
Did you really though

TOBY
ImIm not going to have this
conversation Im sorry

Silence

I know it must be so difficult for
you but I think you have to --

Claude sleeps in bed Margot gently touches his face

whispers
MARGOT
Are you asleep

CLAUDE
(softly)
Yes

Yes

I just talked to your dad

Claudes eyes remained closed but he smiles
MARGOT

thoughtfully

She
MARGOT

charming I always get compliments
about you

smears some eye make-up off of her face

MARGOT
Are you having fun Is it nice to
see Pauline

(opens his eyes)
Yeah I really like her

MARGOT
Yeah She is crazy though
CLAUDE
In what way
MARGOT

Shes really berserk Maybe its
hormones You dont notice
anything different about Pauline

CLAUDE
No
MARGOT
Shes pregnant -- she told me But
shes keeping it a secret -- I mean

from Malcolm and even Ingrid
Which I think is unforgiveable
Now shell have to marry him
Whats she planning -- to get
married and not drink champagne
Then shell just be lying I guess
shes afraid shell miscarry She
probably will I think on some
level shes ambivalent about the
marriage and thats why shes not
telling him

Are you stoned Mom

MARGOT
Maybe a little

CLAUDE

I dont like it
16 INT MALCOLM AND PAULINES ROOM - NIGHT

Water runs from the bathroom Malcolm cradles a glass of
whiskey and stands nude in front of a full length mirror

MALCOLM
(shakes his head)
My scrotum is longer than my penis

He turns around and looks at his ass Pauline walks out of
the bathroom She wears mens pajamas the top open

MALCOLM
Its sweet how Claude looks up to
me
He waits for a reaction and gets none

MALCOLM
Margot doesnt seem as crazy as you
made her out to be

PAULINE
What she did to Toby and Alan
tonight didnt seem crazy enough
for you

MALCOLM
I guess that seemed pretty crazy

PAULINE

(immediately defensive)
Well she cares deeply

MALCOLM
Yeah shes really worried about
Bruce

PAULINE

This has nothing to do with Bruce
She thinks everyone is autistic

Malcolm is about to speak but instead he halts paralyzed

Nothing you keep changing your
position -- Im just trying to

figure out if I should agree with
you or not

PAULINE

to masturbate The bed creaks Finally she flips over and

EXT HOUSE - DAY 18

A croquet game in progress Pauline and Malcolm play Margot
and Claude Ingrid lies in the grass singing to herself
The dog next to her Malcolm concentrates -- he carefully
lines up his shot Finally he swings --

The ball misses the wicket He shakes with frustration

MALCOLM
Fuck it

Claude looks through a slit in the wooden fence and into the
neighbors yard A naked man 40s crouches Arms extend
from below and pull him downward His ass pokes up over the
weeds

MARGOT
Honey youre up

Claude shakes out of his reverie He walks briskly up to his
ball and smacks it It bullets forward and lands just short
of Paulines ball

MARGOT
Claude dont just whack it Think
about it before you hit

CLAUDE
Sorry

Pauline knocks her ball into Claudes She holds her ball
down with her foot and prepares to swing
MALCOLM
Paul what are you doing
PAULINE
m sending Claudes ball into the
bushes
MALCOLM
Take the extra hit

PAULINE
dont want to do that

MALCOLM
Its the smarter play
She whacks -- Claudes ball travels about two feet
PAULINE
Shit
MALCOLM
Pauline See I knew you
couldnt Your feet are too
small
Margot steps up to take her turn She regards the house
MARGOT

You took the awnings down

Claude looks back into the adjacent yard Flashes of skin A
breast Pubic hair Claude crouches to see more clearly --
the bodies disappear from sight

Malcolm draws a deep breath and takes a few practice strokes
He swings -- his ball rockets past Margots rolls up over a
ridge and onto the cement drive It quickly sails down into
the road and bounces into a ditch

Malcolm shakes furiously He lifts his mallet turns toward
the house rethinks momentarily and hurls it up over the
incline and down to the water Pauline puts her hands on her
hips

PAULINE
Well done

MALCOLM
Fuck you

Malcolm hesitates then tramps down the stairs to the beach
Claude watches the pink of flesh moving up and down

MARGOT
Honey youre up
He approaches his ball and smacks it toward the double
wickets

MARGOT
Youre going the wrong way
CLAUDE
Oh

He blushes and laughs Pauline laughs Margot shakes her
head
MARGOT
So stupid
CLAUDE

Mom Im sorry Jesus
Margot places her mallet down and starts toward the house

CLAUDE
Were in the middle of it

MARGOT
This is why I hate games I hate

what it does to me

Pauline cackles loudly Margot turns around and stares at

her Malcolm calls from the stairs

MALCOLM (0S)
Wait were not finished

EXT PATIO - DAY

The five eat a salad nicoise lunch

MARGOT
Malcolm do you notice how Pauline
sometimes cant make eye-contact

How her gaze hovers just above your
head

MALCOLM
Yeah I kind of know what you mean

MARGOT
I always think I have something in
my hair Its not necessarily bad
Paul Its just something you do

Pauline looks mildly horrified She suddenly turns to
Claude
PAULINE
Claude have you ever seen your
mother climb a tree

CLAUDE
No

MARGOT
We dont have much opportunity in
Manhattan
PAULINE

As kids Margot climbed everything
She could even climb that tree

She points at the tall oak that stretches over the fence into
the neighbors property

CLAUDE
Can you do it mom

MARGOT
Maybe later

CLAUDE
No now

INGRID
Do it now Margot

PAULINE
Show him Margot

CUT TO 20
Margot strides toward the tree The group follows behind

She grabs hold of a branch and lifts herself

Claude grins impressed

With brisk dexterity Margot scales the tree

Claude Pauline Malcolm and Ingrid watch with glee from
below

PAULINE

I told you
Margot reaches a perch near the top and looks down at the
gang They wave She waves back
The sun is hot She sweats flushed She takes a deep
breath and relaxes against the bark Trees for miles The
neighbors house is faded and grey In the far distance
toxic white smoke comes out into the sky

An earwig walks across her arm She flicks it off slips for
a moment and catches herself Her breathing grows more

rapid

A bug buzzes around her head She swats at it

Her family has stopped watching Claude and Malcolm throw a
baseball Paulines gone back inside Ingrid clears the
table

MARGOT
(under her breath)
Shit
She wipes her face her shirt is almost entirely soaked The

buzzing continues

Close on Margots ear A small black gnat lands on the lip
of the lobe It hesitates and darts inside the hole

Margot gasps She jams her pinky in her ear
Pauline comes back out with an ice tea

CLAUDE
Whats she doing now

PAULINE
(dryly)
Shes stuck

cut To

A young volunteer fireman climbs a long ladder up the side of
the tree and toward Margot He reaches out his hand to her

MARGOT
(annoyed)
I got it

She slowly lowers herself

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY
Pauline is laughing recounting the story Claude and Ingrid

PAULINE

MARGOT

out of it

CLAUDE

girl whines and lags behind

WOMAN
She knew what she was doing
She starts suddenly toward Margot
WOMAN

Do you understand

Margot backs up quickly The woman stops about ten feet

away

WOMAN
Stay out of it bitch

The woman turns back around She lifts the girl into her
arms and they trudge over the incline and out of sight

INGRID
That was the Voglers

PAULINE

An old orange BMW idles at the end of the driveway Pauline

at Chase

The front door of the Voglers opens and a boy 14 pees from
the entrance-way into the plants in the yard

INGRID

CLAUDE
No Theyre middle class

The boy finishes and violently hurls a toy car at the fence

BOY

the door
INGRID

PAULINE
Youre competitive with everyone
It doesnt matter if they even do
the same thing as you
(to Claude)
Hes competitive with Bono

MALCOLM
Its true I dont subscribe to
the credo that theres enough room
for everyone to be successful I
think there are only a few spots
available and people like Dick
Koosman and Bono are taking them
up

Pauline looks at Malcolms drawing
a man fucking a woman in the ass

Its a graphic image of

floats on a raft and cheers Claude runs along the pool-
side

DICK

DICK

Pauline hits the far wall with her palm and flips around

Margot stops short and follows her sister Theyre neck and

neck Their arms cut in and out of the water

DICK

CLAUDE
No
Pauline lands -- touches the wall first Margot a close
second
CLAUDE

Pauline wins

Pauline beams Margot immediately drifts to the ladder
Shes panting heavily

CLAUDE
Mom cheated You didnt touch the
wall

MARGOT
I did so It doesnt matter I

lost anyway

PAULINE
It was close

Pauline floats on her back exhausted

Ingrid swims beneath Claude -- long strands of hair stream up
from beneath the surface

Margot gets out of the water and Dick wraps her in a towel
For a moment its an embrace Margot looks quickly over at
Claude --

His foot slips

He topples in
Water roars around him

He opens his mouth Bubbles spurt out

He drifts down

Lying next to the drain is a field mouse Its eyes are
white

Splash Hands wrap around him
He goes up

The sounds of wind and blurry voices now clearer
Pauline brings Claude to the surface and pushes him to the
ladder She helps him climb out Ingrid and Maisy are
grinning Their expressions slowly shift as they see
Claudes face
Claude is sobbing
PAULINE
Its okay
Margot immediately wrenches Claude from Paulines grasp She

looks shocked and angry

MARGOT
I got him

She leads her son behind the bushes out of everyones sight

MARGOT
Its okay my baby

She gently lets him down His sneakers squeak and slosh
Claude soaking wet and ashamed looks at his mother She
breaks into laughter Claude wipes the water and tears from

his eyes
CLAUDE
Im sorry I laughed about the tree

EXT FOREST - LATE DAY

Margot walks the path alone She hugs herself as a light
breeze kicks up Her footsteps echo in the trees

The little pink sneaker still lies in the dirt

She crouches down and takes it

CUT TO 32
CLOSE A note is being written

and if you are acting with any sort of abuse toward your
child I will call the police

The word any is then underlined twice The page is torn
from her little brown book

EXT VOGLER HOUSE - EVENING

Margots fist is raised about to knock on the front door
She stops herself She puts the note on the Welcome mat and
holds it in place with the childs shoe She wanders around
to the back of the house She looks into a lighted window

Its a white tiled bathroom

A wet brown animal body covered in clear plastic is balanced
on the sink Mr Vogler tears into the plastic The carcass
is butterflied open exposing the innards and ribs

Mrs Vogler runs the tub She pours salt from a box in the
water The man slides his hand in her waist-band She rubs
against him

Margot chews her cuticle

The man saws the legs His arm jerks back and forth
straining to cut through the bone Sweat pours down his
temples

Margot raises her hand to her face and presses against the
window She peers through her fingers The blade pierces
the bone with a violent release and the hoof falls to the
floor

Margot moves to another window The pigs face now looks at
her

Blood drips and leaks into the crevices of the tile The
woman brandishes a syringe filled with an orange liquid

Suddenly a face appears in the glass Margot leaps back
Its a thin boy He says something The family turns to the
window The father flicks off the bathroom light

From inside Margot illuminates like an apparition

Margot scampers into the trees She pushes through branches
her shirt tears She runs

34 INT CLAUDES GUEST ROOM - EVENING 34
Claude sits on the bed The record sleeve from Blondies
Parallel Lines rests in his lap He reads the lyrics to
the song Sunday Girl He depresses the red record button
on an old portable tape recorder He sings a cappella and
full voice passionately as sweetly as he can

Maisy appears in the doorway and watches Claude turns mid-
lyric He jumps startled

MAISY
Singing

Fumbling Claude shuts off the tape recorder

CLAUDE
Hm A bit

She drifts into the room and hovers closely above Claude who
remains on the bed

Margot passes by in the hallway disheveled from her escape
She watches Maisy takes the lyric sleeve from Claudes
hands Her T-shirt hangs above her waist showing her smooth
stomach

MAISY
Can I make a suggestion

CLAUDE
Uh huh

MAISY

The three kids lie in the grass and watch through the slats
in the fence The Vogler family eats at an outdoor table A
pig turns on a spit over a smoky barbecue Mrs Vogler says

Maisy climbs over Claude to see better He feels her breasts
press against his back Suddenly he swats crazily at his
ear Ingrid is poking him with a blade of grass

INT VOLVO - NIGHT 38

Malcolm drives quickly with Pauline next to him Hes
smoking with the window open Dick and Margot in the
backseat

PAULINE
Margot used to never speak I
remember when we went on a double
date in high school that kid Ron
asked you if English was your first
language
MARGOT
Its true I used to think I might
have some kind of brain defect
PAULINE
You thought you were aphasic
MARGOT
Im still not sure
PAULINE
Oh Jesus Margot
MARGOT
Its very possible Paul

PAULINE
I justyour diagnoses sometimes
irk the hell out of me
Malcolm lights another cigarette -- the car jerks sideways

MARGOT
Malcolm can you slow down

MALCOLM

DICK
I can drive if you like

MALCOLM
No you got dinner the drivings
on me

DICK

Well Ill let you pay your half if
youll slow down

MALCOLM
Well neither Pauline or I ordered
dessert

PAULINE
Malcolm let it go
(taunting)
Margot would insist on driving if
she knew how

MARGOT
(to Dick)
My license elapsed But I know
how
MALCOLM
Its probably for the best I have
this theory I think historically
women have been held back in so
many ways that when they get power
like they do behind the wheel they
cant help but abuse it Its akin
to Hannah Arendts Eichmann theory
about prison guards and prisoners
switching rolls

DICK
Thats a charming philosophy

MARGOT
Yeah Tell that one a lot

MALCOLM
This isnt a blanket thing I
mean women can be great drivers
too

He takes a long satisfied drag on his cigarette

PAULINE
Said the man with the moustache
that he thinks hes wearing in
quotes

MARGOT
Its meant to be funny

MALCOLM
(to Pauline re Margot)
Are you doing this for her benefit
or mine

Malcolm pumps the brake

MALCOLM
What the fuck

PAULINE
What

MALCOLM
(momentarily sober)
No there they go Okay Its
fine I thought I had no brakes
for a minute

Malcolm pitches his cigarette out the window -- it flies
through Margots window and lands on her lap
MARGOT
Malcolm
Dick grabs the lit butt and chucks it in the road
MALCOLM
(turning around)
What

The car swerves again -- everyone jumps
MARGOT
Watch it

MALCOLM
Its fine Margot

PAULINE
(to Malcolm)
Youre just so incompetent

MALCOLM
(exploding)
Why dont you fucking drive
yourselves home

Malcolm screeches the vehicle over to the shoulder They
jolt to a stop

PAULINE
(quietly furious)
Oh God

Pauline opens the door and staggers toward the brush She
leans against a tree and looks like she might vomit Malcolm
watches in the rearview mirror

MARGOT
You should go after her

Malcolm sighs heavily and gets out of the car Margot and
Dick watch out the back window Pauline sees Malcolm coming
and bolts into the woods Malcolm charges after her

DICK
Come back with me tonight

MARGOT

DICK

Claude lies in bed with Ingrid He chews off a piece of his
pinky fingernail He hesitates and places it on an end-
table

INGRID
Why are you putting that there

CLAUDE
I just want to keep it

INGRID
I left a piece of skin in a movie
theater once so it could watch
movies all its life

CLAUDE
I dont know if its the same
thing

INGRID

Are you obsessed with Maisy

CLAUDE
No

INGRID

You have a moustache

CLAUDE
My mom bleaches it

INGRID

Claude hears footsteps creak downstairs He goes to the door
and peers out Pauline and Malcolm a little disheveled and
dirty climb the stairs Neither speaks Malcolm goes into
the hall bathroom Pauline into their room Running water
groans through the old pipes

INGRID
Where are you going I thought we

his moustache -- the electric razor whirring

41 INT MARGOTS ROOM - CONTINUOUS 41
Claude enters Its empty Her brown notebook rests on the
bedside table He hesitates then opens it

Its packed with writing -- a nearly indecipherable cursive

in black ink The name Claude can be made out on the page

Claude takes the book and climbs up into bed He nestles
against the pillow and squints to read the writing

MARGOT (0S)
What are you doing

Claude startles Margot stands in the doorway with a glass
of water

CLAUDE
I didnt think you came home

MARGOT
Where would I be

Claude slides down to the floor He hesitates
CLAUDE
Can I sleep in here
MARGOT
No honey
CLAUDE

We can put a pillow between us

MARGOT
Okay Just for tonight

Claude takes a long pillow and places it like a barrier in
the bed We stay on him as he waits Finally Margot climbs
into the covers in a nightgown

MARGOT
When you were a baby I wouldnt let
anyone else hold you I think that
may have been a mistake

42 EXT HOUSE - MORNING 42

Malcolm his moustache gone a cigarette dangling from his
mouth hammers in a stake at the base of a collapsed white
tent A workman holds a pole steadily

Pauline sets up chairs around a series of tables Ingrid
idles a few feet away Theyre in the midst of talking

INGRID
Why was it a secret

PAULINE
Because I didnt want to get you
excited before it was real Its
not really a baby yet In two more
weeks we can celebrate together

INGRID
Why did you tell Margot
PAULINE
Because shes my sister and I trust
her How do you feel about it

INGRID

Pauline touches Ingrids hair gently

INGRID

She runs toward the house Pauline marches toward Malcolm
PAULINE

Margot told Claude something I
expressly told her in confidence
And he told Ingrid

position Its so fucking
infuriating

MALCOLM
Well its that thing where--

PAULINE

MALCOLM
Okay

PAULINE
Why do I have to be so careful
around her but everyone is allowed

MALCOLM
I dont know if --

PAULINE
Malcolm what did I just say
(sighs)
You know I just want you to take
my side I dont need you to make
it better

Malcolm puts his hand awkwardly on her shoulder

PAULINE

Ingrids really upset about it

Ingrid hurries through the sparkly dewy grass Pauline hugs
her and they spin
CUT TO 43
Margot watches from the upstairs window The mother and
daughter walk arm in arm down what will be the aisle
Finally Margot turns away -- shes in Pauline and Malcolms

of Pauline posing in the bedroom A photograph of Margot and
Pauline in their teens on Halloween dressed as Pat Benatar
and Patty Smyth respectively

Margot grins

Another photo of Margot Pauline and an obese woman -- Becky -
- in their 20s

Margots expression saddens She opens another drawer
Polaroids of Pauline and Malcolm in different sexual poses

She flips through these and drops them on the bureau
Amidst the underwear and socks she finds pill containers
She squints to read the labels She opens one and shakes out
a few blue pills into her palm She swallows one and puts
the rest in her pocket

More drawers open Self-help books incense pamphlets on
Buddhism A stack of pornographic DVDs

CLAUDE (0S)
Hey
Margot starts and shoves the drawer shut
MARGOT

46 EXT FIELD - DAY 46
Pauline and Malcolm open the gate to the Voglers property

tree we should let them know that
there will be people and music on
Saturday and it will be louder than
usual

PAULINE
And that they can come for a glass
of champagne But you tell them
I think they respond to you better

They approach the Voglers sun-worn and paint chipped house

Well I am ultimately one of them
You shouldntve made me shave the
stache

PAULINE
(laughs)
Yeah right

MALCOLM
Oh hey Ingrid is asking me if I

might be caught in there

PAULINE
We were wondering if you and your
wife -- Im sorry I forgot her name

-- would like to come over for

VOGLER
You should ask her She makes the
plans Im going to go in now

inside The screen door bangs
MALCOLM

I felt like you didnt give me a
chance to say what I wanted to say

Pauline hits him in the chest and starts to walk away
Malcolm comes after her his rage growing

MALCOLM
I want to punch that guy in the
nose

PAULINE

Youve never hit anyone

MALCOLM

I have too

PAULINE
Who
MALCOLM
Lots of -- You dont know them

Theyre not around because Ive
punched them

A smile breaks across Paulines face Malcolm seethes

MALCOLM
Dont laugh Pauline Its not
funny Ill fucking punch your
sister

Malcolm clenches his fists He points at Voglers place
MALCOLM
The threat is not out there Its
in our house Its sleeping in my
studio I mean I wouldnt
actually hit her but I feelI
feel like doing it Shes such a
fucking idiot

PAULINE
Shes not an idiot You might not
like her --

MALCOLM
She is She is an idiot Youre
an idiot

PAULINE
Jesus

MALCOLM
Youre both fucking morons Im so

You dont give me any credit

PAULINE
What is wrong

MALCOLM
I dont know I have the emotional
version of whatever bad feng shui
would be I dont know You tell
me you understand this shit
PAULINE
Did you drink your teas

MALCOLM
Yeah I drank my fucking teas
Dont judge me now Really I
think when you look back at this
youre going to see Im not acting
like a crazy person That this is
the right reaction In proportion
with what is going on This is
right

Malcolm looks around furiously The only thing available to
him is a leafy stalk He pulls on it but it wont uproot
He tears the leaves off in a rage

PAULINE
You have the most oddly self-
conscious form of rage Ive ever --

MALCOLM
I hate you
Exhausted he approaches her He says still with anger
MALCOLM

Lets make love

47 CUT TO 47

Pauline walks back to the house buttoning her dress She
looks up suddenly and stops A man watches her from the lawn
He holds a bouquet of flowers Pauline runs to him

PAULINE

They embrace Her hand cups the back of his neck
CLAUDE (0S)
Dad

Claude runs from the house
48 EXT PATIO - LATE DAY 48

Pauline Malcolm Margot Jim Claude and Ingrid eat fish
stew and peasant bread Jims flowers sit in a vase He
wears a tan knit bracelet that Ingrid made
JIM

It was a difficult decision because
Claude has so many friends at
school now but it is expensive and
Bronx Science is a great public
school

CLAUDE

I didnt get into Stuyvesant

MARGOT
Hes not a good test taker

MALCOLM
I went to Stuy

MARGOT
(caught off-guard)
Really
MALCOLM
Really
CLAUDE

Id rather stay at Packer but its
so expensive

Malcolm lifts up a bottle of Jameson from the floor near his
chair and pours himself another stiff drink

JIM
Josh is a great test taker but
Claude thinks more abstractly
Hes more creative Right

CLAUDE
I guess so

Jim smiles warmly at his son

JIM
I saw the one armed man who really
has two arms at the bodega

CLAUDE
Did you give him confusing change

JIM
I did I tripped him up with some
nickels And a Canadian quarter

MALCOLM
You know what I tried the other
day Sitting down to pee Have
you done this Jim

JIM
Nono

MALCOLM
did it as a lark As a joke
really I was going to call
Pauline in and say guess what Im
doing here

PAULINE
m sorry I didnt get to have that
experience

MALCOLM
was thinking you know my dad
used to say Why stand when you
can sit And this is a really
good example of that I mean it
took me so long to try because I
was embarrassed

(to the sisters)
You guys do it all the time
MARGOT

I never sit down in a public place
I squat and hover

Ingrid goes wide eyed for a moment

MALCOLM
Anyway I recommend it At least
to try it

PAULINE

Jim Im sorry about the room

Its usually Malcolms storage room
so its kind of make-shift right
now

JIM
Its fine

Margot stares at Jim
JIM
Margot open your gift

An unopened present in blue tissue paper sits beside Margots
plate

MARGOT
I get self-conscious opening
presents in front of people This
weekend is about Pauline

PAULINE
Ohpoo Open it Margot

Margot slowly unties the white ribbon and peels away the
tape Pauline groans

PAULINE
Come on get to it

Margot takes out a pair of furry slippers

MALCOLM
Those look warm
JIM
I remember last year in Vermont you
said your feet were freezing
Her eyes find Claude who watches his parents carefully She
leans across the table to Jim and they kiss chastely and
briskly on the lips

MARGOT
Thank you

49 INT JIMS CAR - NIGHT 49
Jim drives with Margot in the passenger seat

MARGOT
I already have slippers

JIM
Well thats okay Two sets are

MARGOT

that I already have
JIM

MARGOT
It makes me feel like you dont
know me

She jams her pinky into her ear trying to get at the bug

JIM
Whats wrong with your ear

MARGOT
I asked you not to come I was so

clear and you did it anyway so
blithely

JIM
We need time alone to sort this
out You cant just run away --

MARGOT
Okay so were here Im giving
you this time

JIM

(trying a joke)
Well now youre putting too much
pressure on me

Jim smiles crookedly at her She half-smiles back He takes
a moment preparing to speak Then
JIM

What is that
His headlights catch a woman cowering at the roadside They
pass

MARGOT
Keep driving
Jim slowly pulls over to the shoulder
MARGOT
Nonono Jim no
JIM
Let me just
Jim gets out of the car A sobbing woman crouches cradling

a bloody dog

WOMAN
Please help me

Jim comes toward her

WOMAN

car Please help me

Margot opens her door and steps out
MARGOT
(warily)
Jim

Jim kneels down by the whining pit bull The woman screams

WOMAN
Help me

MARGOT
Careful he might bite you

Jim suddenly lifts up the twitching animal

Margot stubs out the joint on the car roof Jim suddenly
removes his sweater and puts it around her shoulders He
fishes into his pants pocket for his keys Tears start down
Margots cheeks

JIM
Whats wrong

MARGOT
I dont know
(pause)
Before you gave me your sweater I
think I didnt realize I was cold

Margot leans in to him her forehead presses against his
cheek After a moment he puts his arms around her

MARGOT
(quietly)
ake me home and go away

52 INT EXT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Margot smokes by the open door She drinks a glass of white

neither of them

PAULINE
I know Were at the age where

if a guy wants to fuck us its
very tempting

MARGOT
What are you saying

PAULINE
Im saying if you get your sense
of self from being fuckable and
that starts to wane -- its very
hard I almost had an affair too
But you know you dont have to do
it You can I dont know get a
manicure or something

Margot grows furious She turns to hide her face

PAULINE
You know I tell people youre my
closest friend I really miss you

MARGOT
(barely)

PAULINE
But I cant help feeling that you
really came to my wedding because I
live a mile away from the guy

indicates to Margot that she has something in her nostril

A smashing sound Margot steps outside Two hooded figures
turn over a recycling can glass smashes on the ground
Garbage is strewn across the driveway

MARGOT (0S)

Pauline remains seated at the table stunned Margot comes

Voglers son approaches shirtless in swimming trunks
Ingrids attention goes to him

CLAUDE

Ingrid slows lifts her leg and removes a sandal The boy is
behind them Claude yanks Ingrids arm and she topples over

INGRID
Oww

Claude leans down to help her The boy leaps on Claude
They both crash to the ground and roll through the grass

CLAUDE
Get him off me Ingrid

Ingrid hesitates then runs toward the house

Claude wrestles with the boy The boy growls He grabs hold

INT BOOKSTORE - DAY

A placard reads A Conversation with Margot Zeller and Dick
Koosman People mull about with drinks Pauline and Claude
admire the display of Margots books

PAULINE

You really want to know Ill tell
you She wrote a story about Lenny
and me

(flips through pages)
Yeah its in here I mean we were
talking almost every day at this
point and there was no warning
Maybe a couple of remarks that
shed used some things of ours
Then The New Yorker comes -- we
have a subscription -- and theres
the story and Its things we
said and did -- stuff I told her in
confidence

(MORE )

PAULINE (CONTD)
I think it helped end our marriage
I read it and thought She hates
me

CLAUDE
She doesnt hate you

Pauline stares at a blown up author photo of her sister

PAULINE
You think Margot tried to murder
me when we were girls She put me
on a baking sheet sprinkled me
with paprika and put me in the
oven

CUT TO
The crowd files in Margot and Dick stand in a corner

MARGOT
Jim was here

Dick flips through some notes

DICK
s Jim still writing

MARGOT
(nods)
told him to go to Vermont without
me

DICK
d love to see him tell a linear
story for a change Jim never
wanted to make it easy for the
reader did he The nicest man
ve ever met but he cant play
the game

MARGOT
m not joining him Im going to
stay here and thenwell see

(pause)

The guys pointing at us

cut To 58

Margot and Dick sit on stools holding microphones in front of
rows of fold-out chairs Only a few empty seats remain
Pauline and Claude sit in the back

DICK
Im very interested in your story
Middle Children

Some people applaud but it trickles off before it gets
started

DICK
The father is a loathsome character
yet we also feel a strange sympathy
for him

MARGOT
Yeah well I was very interested in
exploring a father-daughter
relationship While he clings
desperately to her suffocates her
really he also silently resents
the responsibility of parenthood

DICK
Theres this sexualized push-pull
with Daphne which I find --

MARGOT
He craves isolation really I
always thought of him as someone
who so over identifies with
everyone around him that he begins
to lose all sense of himself

DICK
You make his only recourse to
abandon his family including his
beloved daughter

MARGOT
Right thats true Thats true
DICK
I write historical fiction so I
dont have to answer to this but I
wonder for someone who writes so
nakedly about family how
autobiographical is this portrait

Margot rests her lips on the tip of the microphone

MARGOT
My father was a loving person He
had his days of course buthe
was devoted to us as children I
wouldnt have written this portrait
were it true

Pauline nods slightly

DICK
But Im interested in how the
father could be in fact a portrait
of you
Margot stares dumbstruck

MARGOT
UmmI dont Why do you assume
its based on We all take from

life I had to have our
refrigerator repaired the other day
at our apartment in Manhattan I
was alone with a guy think he
was Puerto Rican sent over
byWhirlpool I think it is who
made our fridge Although he said
he worked for an independent
organization who Whirlpool
subcontracts I think he was
retarded There was an anger in

him and suddenly I became afraid
for my life I called Jim at NYU

I asked him to come home

Margot stops Her face is awash in sweat

Pauline takes Claudes hand and presses it to her chest

eyes widen fixed on his mother

MARGOT
t might be Frigidaire Im
sorry I dont Im not sure
what Im I think I need to take
a moment

Margot sits on the back stairs drinking a glass of wine with

around the lawn She watches Malcolm prepare to take the

Margot tosses the remainder of her drink into the weeds

MARGOT
Pauline told me shes very
disappointed in you

CLAUDE
Why

MARGOT
She thinks you laze about the
house Ingrid is always offering
to help clean or cook She made
bracelets for all the guests Even
Malcolm puts up the tent You just
wait until everyone else does it
for you

CLAUDE
Thats not true

MARGOT
It is true Youre never helpful
I wish I had taught you better

Manners

CLAUDE
I can try to make popovers If I
can remember how

MARGOT
Dont bother

She looks at him with grave disappointment

CLAUDE
Why are you looking at me like
that

MARGOT
I just see how much youve changed
Your body language You used to be
rounder and more graceful Youre
so stiff now So blase

CLAUDE
What do you mean

MARGOT
(retreating)
I cant explain it

Margot shakes her head Shes suddenly distraught

MARGOT

Claude looks devastated He starts toward the beach
Margots eyes well up -- she says trying to make things
better

MARGOT
Youre still handsome

Pauline marches toward Malcolm Malcolm wears the safety
goggles and revs the chainsaw

PAULINE
Are you able to do this yourself
MALCOLM
Pauline do you want me to cut it
down or not
PAULINE
Watch the tent
The jagged blades pierce the trunk Pauline crunches her
face Malcolm stops suddenly
He walks around the tree and inspects the bark
MALCOLM
(indicating his fleece)
I liked how it looked on Vogler

Pauline starts to say something -- stops Then

PAULINE

I think its over between Dick and

Margot He was so cruel to her

today And poor Claude had to

watch it all She should just get

out of the marriage and then she

can fuck whoever she wants you

know Its cowardly And Dick

Koosman What a choice I

meanyou know
MALCOLM

I agree I hate the idea of Dick

fucking Margot
PAULINE

What does that mean You want to

fuck Margot
MALCOLM

Pauline thats not what I said
PAULINE

I know you have a crush on her you

already told me that

Malcolm reddens and starts the chainsaw again They yell

over the noise

MALCOLM
I didnt say that I said I
thought she was attractive after
you grilled me She has no
interest in me anyway Not that it
would matter if she did
PAULINE
Have you ever done anything like

that
MALCOLM

PAULINE

Malcolm shuts the motor

MALCOLM

PAULINE
Right just a regular friendship
between you and a twenty year old
girl

MALCOLM

Pauline looks at him long and hard Malcolm takes off his
goggles
PAULINE

Malcolm and Pauline continue to stare at one another He
guns the chainsaw Tears spill suddenly from his eyes
Pauline startles He flicks the switch off

We made out I made out with her
I dont know why I dont even
like her Its been a heady time

Pauline rushes at the tree -- she smacks her hands on the
trunk and throws all her weight behind one great shove It

doesnt budge In frustration and rage she runs

of Paulines bathroom

Oh

Maisy comes

out

Pauline nods strangely She goes to the window Her dove
grey wedding dress hangs on the back of the door

MAISY
I love your wedding dress Its so
unconventional and great
Pauline nods Her eye catches the Polaroids of her and
Malcolm nude which lie on top of the bureau Maisy looks at
the pictures too
Maisy shifts uneasily and leaves the room Pauline follows
Maisy walks down the hallway aware that Pauline is right
behind her
MAISY
Is everything okay

PAULINE

(pause)
Nothing

Maisy stops at the landing Claude sits at the bottom of the
staircase playing with a string

MAISY
Claude do you want to play
croquet

CLAUDE
Okay

Pauline raises her leg -- her foot hovers at Maisys lower
back She hesitates Claude reacts with horror Maisy
turns around to see Pauline with her foot in the air like
shes doing karate Paulines eyes dart around aimlessly

Maisy stares confused Pauline slowly lowers her leg
Something dawns on Maisy She races down the stairs

EXT HOUSE - DAY
The deafening shriek of the blade as it cuts into the tree
Malcolm is soaked in sweat Ingrid watches from a few feet

away

In the distance -- Dicks orange BMW grinds into the
driveway Maisy hurries toward him

Ingrid says buried in the noise

INGRID
Theres Dick

Malcolm sees Dick He pushes the blade harder into the wood

INGRID
Is it almost ready
MALCOLM
(distracted)
Almost
Maisy is talking to her father Dick spots Malcolm He
immediately starts toward him Malcolm hesitates Cold fear
creeps up his neck

Dick speeds up
Malcolm backs up slowly -- drops the chainsaw -- and bolts
toward the water Ingrid watches confused

Dick takes off after him Malcolm stumbles down the long
wooden stairs to the beach

Malcolm runs wobbily -- he pants already out of breath
Sweat pours down his face and body

Dicks gait is swift -- his arms stiff bent at the elbow
His jeans make a swish swish He takes the stairs two at a
time

Malcolm grasps the railing moving as fast as he can
sideways trying not to fall He reaches the beach his feet
sinking in the sand He trips and topples forward

He looks up -- Dick lunges

Dick pounds Malcolms head and face Malcolm throws his arms
up and tries to block the punches

MALCOLM
I didnt do anything I didnt do
anything

DICK

Fucking sleazebag
Dick gets up He kicks Malcolm hard

DICK
I dont ever want to see you again
Malcolm balls himself up against a rock

MALCOLM
Fuck off dickhead

He cries

Dick marches forward and kicks Malcolm again hard

Dick lights a brown cigarette and walks away

MALCOLM
Ow

screams

MALCOLM
Fucking dickbag

Malcolm

Shes lying

He touches his face and sees the blood on his fingers

MALCOLM
(choking on tears)
Oh man

Theres a rustling noise in the wind Malcolm looks -- a mud-
and sea-coated Wizard watches him with a panting smile

PAULINE
(suddenly)
Ingrid

EXT FIELD - CONTINUOUS 68

fq

The purple of Ingrids batik shirt shines in the grass
beneath the tree

The trunk -- a gash at its base -- teeters
Pauline takes off into the field

ngrid sings to herself and traces the branches in the air
with her finger

Pauline sprints --

PAULINE
Ingrid

Ingrid says to no one in particular

INGRID
What

Paulines breaths are rapid jagged
Ingrid stands

A wind whips up The tree sways

Pauline thrusts her arms out seizes Ingrid and hurls herself
away from the tree

INGRID
Ow

Ingrid sobs as they run Pauline looks back The tree is
still standing They embrace a few feet out of its range

INGRID
It wasnt going to fall
PAULINE
Im sorry
Malcolm trudges up the stairs Hes bloody and tattered
Wizard trots behind him
INGRID

Wizard
She hugs the dog and holds him by the collar The three of
them stand a few feet apart

Theres a horrible creak -- and suddenly --

-- crack --
Malcolm pulls both girls toward him --
The tree topples -- the thick trunk rips through the wedding

tent and crashes through tables and chairs and the fence --
-- onto the Voglers property
INT VOLVO - DAY 69

The speedometer needle wavers around 30 Margot clutches the
steering wheel Claude looks morose Pauline and Ingrid sit
stonily in the back seat The Volvo jerks into the oncoming
lane and back Margot draws a deep breath

CLAUDE
I thought you couldnt drive

MARGOT
(irritated)
I can drive Why does everyone say
that I used to drive

They inch up a small hill A car cascades down past them
The Volvo shakes Pauline suddenly snaps out of her daze

PAULINE
We have to call people and cancel

INGRID
What happened Can I still sing

Margot rolls down the window

MARGOT
(to Claude)
You do smell

CLAUDE
Well Im not wearing any
deodorant
They reach the top of the hill over the crest and descend
The vehicle picks up speed Margot presses down on the
brake

MARGOT
Shit
CLAUDE
What

MARGOT

I dont think
(she pumps again)
No We dont have brakes

PAULINE
(resigned)

The brakes are bad thats right

CLAUDE
What does that mean

MARGOT
What do you think it means

CLAUDE
I mean what can we do

The car coasts faster down the hill

CLAUDE
Mom

Margot places her arm stiffly across Claudes front

Pauline wraps her body around her daughter

Margot swerves into the shoulder -- she makes a sharp turn
into the forest and crashes through the bramble and muck

The car slows until it comes to a sudden stop at the base of
a tree

cut To 70

Margot and Claude Pauline and Ingrid trudge through the bony
white trees of the forest -- their bags weigh them down

Theyre all covered in sweat and theres dirt caked on their
feet and ankles

MARGOT
I ruined these shoes
Paulines face screws up Shes suddenly in pain She races
behind a tree Margot follows
INGRID

Mom are you okay
PAULINE (0S)
Dont look

Margot stops

PAULINE (0S)
Shit

INGRID
Mom what happened

PAULINE (0S)
Nothing

Margot steps to see around the trunk The kids follow
behind Pauline removes her panties from under her skirt
She tosses them in the brush

PAULINE
Fuck
Margot turns to the kids Ingrid hides a smile
CLAUDE

Did she poop in her pants

MARGOT
It happens to everyone Not just
babies Itll happen to you too
someday

EXT FERRY - DAY 71

Margot and Claude sit streaked with mud and perspiration
Margot drinks a beer Claude a Coke Margot pops a blue pill
in her mouth and swallows Ingrid swings on the rail

Pauline hangs up a cell phone and hands it back to her
sister She takes the beer and swigs

PAULINE
I left mom and Becky a message

MARGOT
I dont think mom knows how to work
the machine
Margot puts her pinky in her ear

MARGOT
I can hear it flapping

PAULINE
You should take care of that It
can hatch eggs

Claude turns his head In the Chevy next to them sits Mrs
Vogler and the Vogler boy She sings along to the radio
She runs her hand through her sons hair gently He nestles
into her shoulder

EXT SEASIDE TOWN STREET - EVENING 72
The four of them get out of a taxi A small peeling hotel
INT HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 73

A dark tight space with a faded and dirty green wall-to-wall
carpet Pauline combs Ingrids hair on one of the two double
beds Ingrid practices her wedding song Claude sits on the
other bed and looks into the open bathroom door Margot
stands with her back to him She talks on her cell phone in
a whisper She hangs up Claude walks inside The sink
drips

MARGOT
Sweety theres a bus that leaves
to Vermont from town tomorrow

and hes going to pick you up

CLAUDE
Arent you coming

MARGOT
No
CLAUDE
Why not
MARGOT

I have to help out Paul and Ingrid

Claude tugs gently on his yellow bracelet

CLAUDE
I dont want to go tomorrow
The distant bong of a low drum and beneath that -- chanting

Claude follows Margot to the window Ingrid and Pauline are
already looking out

Clumps of demonstrators march in the street Some people
hold up signs with slogans -- NO MORE -- BRING BACK -- the
rest is obscured from the window Some marchers are dressed
in black hoods with white face paint and carry cardboard
coffins

PAULINE
Theres Malcolm

Pauline points to a guy in a vest As he turns around we see
it isnt him Pauline withdraws suddenly on the verge of
tears

PAULINE
I cant live in that house alone

MARGOT
Youre going to be fine

PAULINE
Maybemaybe I could get a place
in Brooklyn -- Williamsburg or
something People are living there
right

MARGOT
You dont want to live there Its
all young people

PAULINE
But what do you think of that idea
MARGOT
Maybe Lets see You know if you

PAULINE
(through tears)
Youre already trying to pass me
off on mom

MARGOT
Dont say that Come on youll
come home with us

PAULINE
You dont even know where youre
going to live You might have to
move in with mom too

Margot tightens

PAULINE
What Oh
(mouthing a whisper)
Didnt you tell him

Margot looks at her son who continues to watch out the
window

cut To 74

Pauline emerges from behind the armoire doors wearing a long
nightshirt that reads I Spent The Night With Arsenio Hall
She enters the bathroom She mutters to herself

PAULINE
What have I done What have I
done

Margot jimmies up the stiff window to let in some air A few
stragglers still march in the street Trash and pieces of
signage line the gutter Margot turns into the room She
puts her hand to her cheek and strokes her smooth skin She
watches her son who removes his jeans for bed

CLAUDE
What

MARGOT
Nothing Just then I felt so much
love for you
75 CUT TO 75

Pauline tucks in Ingrid who lies next to Claude Margot sits
on the other bed scribbling in her brown notebook Pauline
marches around and across to the other side of the room She
snatches the book out of Margots hands

MARGOT
Hey
PAULINE
You cannot write about this You

MARGOT
I wasnt writing about you
PAULINE

You already took a part of my life

goes for Ingrid and Malcolm and
Wizard We all own our own rights

MARGOT

Pauline glances at the book
PAULINE
If I could read your handwriting

ever see a story that involves a
hotel room or any of this shit I
will fucking take your bowels out
Pauline thrusts the book back at Margot --

INT BARRESTAURANT - MORNING 76

Cheap plastic tables A small karaoke stage in front
Margot Claude Pauline and Ingrid sit at the bar Margot
drinks her wine with ice She wears Jims sweater The kids
have Cokes The remains of ketchup-soaked french fries in a
plastic red basket lie between them

A man with a mullet climbs up on the karaoke stage The
music begins The man sways and sings On and On by Stephen
Bishop He croons sweetly and beautifully Claudes eyes
moisten Margot swallows a blue pill and chases it with the
wine She takes her sons hand and whispers
MARGOT

Margot quickly turns to her sister

MARGOT
No Dont Im telling you

Pauline walks over to a pay phone
CUT TO

Pauline holds the receiver to her ear She stares at a
drawing of a monster fucking a woman on the wall above the
pay phone Malcolm is crying

MALCOLMS VOICE
The tent looks so lonely
PAULINE
It has no one to get married in it

78 EXT HOUSE - INTERCUT
Malcolm sits in the grass the tree and wreckage behind him

MALCOLM

PAULINE

At the bar Margot watches her sister carefully She absent-
mindedly picks through her red knit bracelet and drops it
onto the floor
Ingrid slides something small and grey across the bar to

Claude

INGRID
You left it in my room
Its a piece of fingernail He hesitates then puts it in his

pocket

At the phone Pauline rests her head against the wall
Malcolm is bawling on the other end

PAULINE

Malcolm clutches Wizard and sputters

MALCOLM
I ate some of the cake I dont

MALCOLM

Malcolm says something incomprehensible
PAULINE
I cant understand you honey
Margot finishes her glass of wine her eyes still on her
sister
INGRID
Theres gramma and Aunt Becky
Margot startles and looks out the window Across the street
is an older woman 70s and a large woman mid 30s eating
ice cream cones and looking in a boarded-up shop window

PAULINE
They didnt get my message

Pauline now stands above them

MARGOT

A huge parking lot A bus in the distance Claude tries to

keep pace with his mother

CLAUDE

Pauline has transferred all her

An unfamiliar sound comes out of Margot The sadness is

unexpected -- she sobs uncontrollably She tries to speak
MARGOT

CLAUDE
But was there anything real

No How many times do I have to

She watches a man sustain a long embrace with another man
Margot closes her eyes She breathes deeply
MARGOT
You used to need me to watch you

CLAUDE

MARGOT

(vaguely)
When you first started to play with
friends you wouldnt do it unless

would go out the back door I
dont know where I would go Our
yard didnt lead anywhere anyway

She takes off her sweater and reveals an old faded yellow T-
shirt She isnt wearing a bra Claude says suddenly

CLAUDE
I masturbated last night While
everyone was asleep I went into the
bathroom and did it

MARGOT
You dont have to tell me sweety

The bus driver slams the luggage compartment closed

Margot ties her sweater around her waist and takes Claudes
hand They approach the bus Claudes body tenses

CLAUDE

CLAUDE

She hugs him He clutches her
CLAUDE

The world feels strange to me right
now

Margot nods sympathetically She kisses his lips and
releases him He reaches into his bag and shyly puts on his
wrap-around punk sunglasses Margot makes a face

CLAUDE

MARGOT
They make your face look too wide

Claude removes them and puts them back in the bag

CLAUDE

She backs away --

CLAUDE

MARGOT
(hesitates)

Claude doesnt move Margot points at the bus and mouths

Go

She turns in the other direction Claude frustrated

and anxious approaches the vehicle

INT BUS - CONTINUOUS 81

Claude hurries toward the back and finds a window seat He
puts his bag next to him and looks out the dirty glass

Claudes POV Margot her back to him puts her finger in her
ear and shakes her head

The sweater around her waist loosens and drifts to the
pavement She starts walking

The bus hisses and lurches forward Claude strains to see
Margot looks back
The bus groans as it picks up speed Margot sprints

MARGOT
Wait

Shes runs full speed waving her arms wildly

MARGOT
Wait Wait

She pants breathless
The bus brakes

She passes Claudes window We stay on Claude He waits
Finally she appears next to him covered in sweat and
panting She kisses him on the head The bus starts moving

MARGOT
(almost euphoric)
Did you see me running out there

CLAUDE
Yeah
Margot cranes her neck to see outside

MARGOT
Good That was a lot of running
Im out of breath
Claude turns away from his mother and looks out the window

CUT TO BLACK
