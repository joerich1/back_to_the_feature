1 EXT DESERT LANDSCAPE (UTAH) - DAY

Jagged mountains defy a dark foreboding sky We hear
PLODDING HOOVES CREAKING LEATHER A lone wanderer
appears Wearing a long coat and a battered hat he
carries a bolt-action carbine His name forgotten
history remembers him simply as THE POSTMAN

His laden pack mule BILL BRAYS as they pass a battered
sign The Great Salt Lake Marina They start down a
slope and begin to cross a

DRY LAKE BED

A bizarre wind-swept sight Dozens of boats resting lee-
to on the dry cracked earth Its like God pulled the
plug Rusty mooring chains snake their way around house
boats ski boats and a cabin cruiser or two

WOMAN (V0O)
The last of the great cities died
when my father was a child
Another victim of yet another war
The plagues followed And the
terrors The living hid

themselves away in tiny hamlets in
hopes of surviving whatever new
madness conspired to rob them of
the little that remained The
Earth itself had fallen prey to
chaos For three years a dirty
snow fell that even summer could
not erase The ocean was barren
Poisoned Near death

As The Postman continues to cross the CAMERA PULLS BACK
Hes soon lost in the massive vista

WOMAN (V0O)
Sixteen long years passed before
the great lungs started working
again My father said it was as
if the ocean breathed a great sigh
of relief

A RUMBLE of THUNDER RAIN begins to fall The earth just

sucks it up at first but its coming hard Rivulets run
Puddles form We begin to get the feeling that soon these
boats will be tugging at the mooring chains once again

TRACK a rivulet as it runs filling up a depression in the
sand And then running to fill another in a series of
depressions They make a pattern we recognize as --

MANS FOOTPRINTS

These tracks may already be days old as they fill with
rain water Then the sound of light padded FOOTFALLS
A LION ENTERS FRAME Lean hungry and dangerous the big
cat has been tracking this man He lets out a low
disappointed GROWL The rain has foiled his dinner

plans -- for now

EXT HIGHWAY ON-RAMP (UTAH) - DAY

A bullet-ridden sign reads US 84 North The Postman
leads Bill down a barren 4-lane Weeds poke up through
the asphalt The rusting hulk of a car rests in the
median covered in a tangle of purple wisteria The
Postman plucks a flower He sticks it into a buttonhole
and continues

BILL BRAYS woefully In answer

THE POSTMAN
I dont know And if you ask me
again Im going to slug you

They near a sign Thank You For Visiting Utah The
Postman waves shouts to the sign as he passes it

THE POSTMAN
Its been fun hasnt it kids
(to the sign)
Youre welcome

EXT LANE (IDAHO) - BILLBOARD - DAY

Bill tugs up weeds as The Postman is climbing up a ladder
on a highway that razor cuts the plains to the horizon

Above The Postman sands atop a billboard catwalk He
references a tattered road atlas scans the horizon
through binoculars with one broken lens He pauses at a
Union 76 ball just visible above the tree line

EXT HIGHWAY TRAVEL STOP (IDAHO) - DAY

A 76 Station and the remains of a Howard Johnsons
Alert carbine in hand The Postman leads in the mule
Rusting cars sag on flattened tires Theres a stripped
fire engine its cracked hoses leading to the HoJo
foundation which bristles with burned timbers

Bill stops to drink out of a stream The Postman swats at
him with his hat

THE POSTMAN
Damnit Bill you know I need to
check it first

Bill hangs his head The Postman digs through his pack
He removes an old Tupperware container and replaces its
contents -- a tiny sheaf of litmus papers and several
small bottles -- with stream water He adds a few drops
from each bottle Swirls it around Then dips a tiny
strip of paper into the water The paper turns a vivid
purple The Postman is dubious

THE POSTMAN
Better than turpentine
(touches some
to his lips)
Tastes about the same Your call
Bill

Bill drinks

THE POSTMAN
You aint picky Bill I like
that about you

The Postman takes his carbine and a burlap sack and
crosses to the 76 Station An old extension ladder on the
ground The pole holding up the 76 ball has a 30-degree
bend in it like someone once tried to pull it over
Beyond the 76 ball the sun sets -- but we here in the
20th Century have never seen such a wild riot of color
before

The Postman tries the station door Locked Smiling
ironically he steps in through the blown-out window

INT 76 STATION - OFFICE - DAY

A shambles The Postman kicks around the table He finds
a few beat-up CDs flips through them Reads the label

THE POSTMAN
Running on Empty Tell me about
it

Tossing it he turns stops There resting on a pile of
trash is a bashed-in portable TV The Postman smiles

THE POSTMAN
Hey Bill We got TV 147
channels Everything from Jesus
to Jeopardy

He steps over switches on the set Nothing happens but
The Postman pretends just the same He mimics static
then

THE POSTMAN
Like sands through the hour-
glass so are the days of our
lives

(switching channels)
Michael Shields come on down
youre the next contestant
onThe Price is Right

(switching again)
Ill take Domestic Nuclear
Disasters for two hundred
thousand Alex

The Postman stops suddenly Click

THE POSTMAN
We interrupt our regularly
scheduled program to bring you the
Second Civil War Well shit

The Postman stares at the blank screen a moment Theres
a sudden panicked RUSTLING from behind the service
managers desk The Postman wheels around raises the
carbine

THE POSTMAN
I dont want any trouble I bet
you dont either Lets just
call it a draw okay

Sudden MOVEMENT The Postman shouts in surprise as a Doe
dashes out from behind the desk Scared it bounds back
and forth between the walls Then freezes in the corner
The Postman sighs in relief lowers the carbine

THE POSTMAN
Look out Bill

The doe bolts for the window and runs right into Bill
Bill has a conniption fit

Investigating further The Postman spots a cigarette
machine The front glass is smashed and all the slots are
empty But he looks down to the lock at the bottom Its
intact He pulls a crowbar from the sack crouches by the
machine and digs the pry into a seam and pulls

The panel bursts open to reveal four half-open cartons of
cigarettes He doesnt believe it for a second Then

THE POSTMAN
Im rich

EXT 76 STATION - NIGHT

Embers of a campfire glow The Postman is asleep the
carbine in reach

BILL BRAYS and nervously stamps his hooves The Postman
reaches for the carbine only to find the barrel of a
shotgun pointed in his face

Three BANDITS Hard-eyed and ugly One barely 20 is
mostly just ugly The Postman looks down the barrels of a
shotgun a rifle and a revolver The LEAD BANDIT kicks
the carbine out of reach

THE POSTMAN
Im just passing through I dont
mean anyone any harm
(re stream)
Waters good

The Lead Bandit pokes at The Postmans shoulder with the
muzzle of his rifle The Postman knows why

THE POSTMAN
Im not a Holnist

The Lead Bandit pokes again Harder The Postman opens
his shirt reveals his bare left shoulder

THE POSTMAN
Okay

They just stare at him none saying a word Creepy
THE POSTMAN
Im headed for a town called St
Rose Somewhere west of Portland

THE POSTMAN
Sure Theres the ladder
BANDIT 20

The Lead Bandit is about to smack Bandit 20 again -- then

he sees the logic out of it The Postman shakes his head
but isnt that convincing

LEAD BANDIT
You go up and get it

cut To

EXT 76 BALL - DAWN

The ladder set against the bent pole Prodded by a
shotgun The Postman climbs disappears through the hole
and into the tilting 76 ball

INT 76 BALL - DAWN

Full of The Postmans earthly possessions Trick is how
to save them and his life at the same time He spies an
old wrench remnant of an attempt to remove the rusty
bolts holding the ball in place An idea begins to take
shape

LEAD BANDIT (0S)
Just you start tossing those
cigarettes down
BANDITS
Theres no answer The Bandits eye each other nervously

BANDIT 20
Maybe he fell asleep

76 BALL

The Postman grabs the wrench starts working one of the
last two rusted bolts As it starts to give

THE POSTMAN
Its going to take a second I
got my stuff bolted in

BANDITS
The Lead Bandit takes a cautious step back
LEAD BANDIT
Put some buckshot through it

Martin Just to hurry him up

HULKING BANDIT
I only got three shells left

LEAD BANDIT
So use his gun

The Hulking Bandit picks up the carbine and aims CLICK
It isnt loaded The Hulking Bandit tosses the gun aside
pulls a knife from his boot Grimly he begins to climb
76 BALL

Cramped The Postmans busy at the base of the ball
trying to unscrew the last remaining bolt It wont
budge

LADDER

The Hulking Bandit has only a few more rungs to go
76 BALL

No good Times up The Postman starts rocking the pole
LADDER
The Hulking Bandit has reached the opening -- feels the

rocking motion Hangs on
( )

76 BALL
Knife in hand the Hulking Bandit looks inside At that
instant The Postman rocks the pole one more time The
rusty bolt is not enough to keep the balls full weight in
place It pops The ball is frozen for an instant before
going with the poles tilt
LADDER
The 76 ball drops off the pole rolling over the Hulking
Bandits back and down the ladders incline The other
Bandits dive clear as the 76 ball hurtles past

THE POSTMAN

whips head over heels as the ball speeds away

FIELD

The 76 ball launches off a dirt berm but soon comes to a
stop as it slams into an old utility pole and bursts
apart Fighting the vertigo The Postman staggers to his
feet

THE POSTMAN
Bill

Bill bolts from the station as the Lead Bandit raises the
RIFLE and FIRES at The Postman

Losing balance The Postman lands on his butt just before
a bullet splinters the utility pole above his head
Wobbly he tries to gather his packs The Bandits charge
quickly closing the ground but Bill is there first

Holding as much as he can The Postman heaves himself over
Bills back As the mule gallops away the Lead Bandit
aims the rifle Hes got The Postman in his sights

Hes about to fire when -- Bandit 20 stands up INTO the
SHOT Hes got a fistful of cigarettes in each hand and
hes laughing like a hyena

BANDIT 20
Were rich

EXT OVERLOOK HILL (IDAHO) - DAY

The Postman sits on a rock holding Bills halter so the
mule must face him They are in the midst of an argument

THE POSTMAN
Its true we havent done this in
a while but its like riding a
bicycle Now open your mouth

The Postman pries his mouth open Taking a toothbrush he
tends to Bills teeth then gives him an appraising look
BILL BRAYS

THE POSTMAN

I know the rule Its my rule
Avoid civilization at all costs
But we gotta eat dont we

(as BILL BRAYS again)
What are you so worried about
Bill All you gotta do is stand
there Im the one with all the
lines

The Postman leads the mule down the hill toward the town
far below Making his case all the while -- even as BILL
BRAYS in protest

EXT VILLAGE SQUARE (IDAHO) - DAY

A patch of mud In the center of the square fifty
townspeople stand before a plank stage where The Postman
wraps up a performance of MacBeth He plays it with a

mis-remembered gusto the people enjoy Children

especially are enamored A heavily-muscled man WOODY
lingers on the fringe of the crowd -- watching The Postman
with inscrutable intensity

THE POSTMAN
They said Fear not MacBeth
til Birnam Wood comes to
Dunsinane

He looks off stage for someone but no one appears

THE POSTMAN
I said Birnam Wood comes to
Dunsinane

Bill trots on-stage Covered with twigs BILL is Birnam
Wood He BRAYS lustily The audience laughs in delight
The children clap Only Woody seems unaffected

10
The Postman grabs two wooden swords -- he knows its going

well

THE POSTMAN
Arm arm yourselves If the
witchs words are true therell
be no running or hiding here

Shaking off the twigs Bill takes one of the swords in his
mouth The two of them dash back and forth pretending to
fight off an imaginary attack Finally The Postman looks
out at the audience remembers the words the best he can

THE POSTMAN

Tomorrow and tomorrow and the
day after that Out brief candle
Lifes but a walking shadow a
poor player that struts his hour
upon the stage and is heard no
more Its a tale told by a
moron Full of sound and fury
signifying nothing

(waves sword)
But blow wind Come wrack At
least well die with the harness
off our back

The audience erupts in applause But Woody stands still
as stone The Postman takes a bow Even Bill does a
cross-legged dip Knowing when to quit he steps off the
stage to many hearty handshakes

Woody watches his every move MRS THOMPSON one of the
towns leaders steps up Shes accompanied by crotchety
old CURMUDGEON LARRY

MRS THOMPSON
The children have never heard
Shakespeare before

THE POSTMAN
(grinning)
They still havent

The Curmudgeon is still clapping

THE POSTMAN
Thanks Youre very nice

CURMUDGEON LARRY
Im clapping because you stink THE POSTMAN
I dont think you understand how
it works

CURMUDGEON LARRY
When I was young I tried to be an
actor I was awful But now I
wont die thinking I was the worst
one

THE POSTMAN
Im glad I could help

MRS THOMPSON
Larry stop it
(to The Postman)
You were very good

THE POSTMAN

Good enough to get something to
eat

Before she can answer a SENTRY cries

SENTRY
Holnists Holnists are coming

All eyes look down the road leading into town A raiding
party of Holnist Cavalry are on their way in Mrs
Thompson sees The Postmans concern

MRS THOMPSON
Its okay We give them food and
supplies All the towns do

MAN 1
They hardly kill anyone lately
Just take a woman sometimes

THE POSTMAN
Well Id just as soon not give
them anything of mine Lets find
the back door Bill

The Postman gathers his stuff slings packs onto Bill
The forty Holnists in orange and black uniforms ride in
Theyre armed with mostly pistols and rifles Some carry
bows knives spear guns and swords On their bare
shoulders branded into the flesh -- the number 8 10
Out front always leading by example is GENERAL
BETHLEHEM Tough smart merciless with style Commander

of the United Clans of Holn Nothing escapes his eye

A little behind him is the mysteriously silent Colonel
Getty second in command

The Postman finished packing begins to move from
building to building -- careful not to attract any
attention

BETHLEHEM (0S)
What are you doing there
The Postman freezes turns is relieved to find
Bethlehems not talking to him at all The General looks
down from his horse at children playing an impromptu game
of Birnam Wood

The children stop stare at their feet Bethlehem affects
a kindly smile to accompany his gentler tone

BETHLEHEM
I said what are you doing

Meantime The Postman continues his surreptitious escape
The MAYOR hurries forward to greet Bethlehem

MAYOR
Its just a game General
Bethlehem Something they saw in
a play No harm in it

BETHLEHEM
A play
(to kids)
Show me Its all right
children show me

One BRAVE BOY finds his voice barely

BRAVE BOY
Arm arm yourselves No running
from the witches

BETHLEHEM
(surprised)
Shakespeare is it Well Im
sorry I missed it

10 MAYOR
You should know sir we havent
nearly stocked the game we thought
we would

BETHLEHEM
Really But you had time for a
play
Head down The Postman makes for the back way But its
guarded by three daunting Holnist soldiers No getting by
them The Postman does a quick 180 goes back the way he
came

Bethlehem looks at the frightened townsfolk

BETHLEHEM

Im taking three conscripts from
each town They will have the
honor of serving in the Holnist
Army until such time as I see fit

(to Mayor)
Three men You suppose you could
do that

The Mayor nods in acquiescence Bethlehem looks to a
Holnist officer The officer IDAHO steps up and
addresses the town

IDAHO
All men between 15 and 50 and of
suitable ethnic foundation are
required to show themselves now

The Holnist soldiers fan out prodding any likely or
unwilling candidates forward

The Postman is now walking behind Bethlehem Some of the
Townspeople cast him a furtive glance as he makes his way
toward the open courtyard and ultimately the gate out of
town

Three conscripts are hustled before Bethlehem He looks
over the first -- Woody Smells him Not much of a
decision here

BETHLEHEM
Acceptable
IDAHO
Sir
BETHLEHEM

Acceptable Captain

10 The second -- a thin teenager Bethlehem feels his arm
turns his head from side to side

BETHLEHEM
Youll need to put some meat on
but I like an impressionable mind
Acceptable

The third -- an innocuous man Or so we think Bethlehem
stares hard at his olive skin traces a finger over the
bump on the mans nose

BETHLEHEM
Mongoloid Unacceptable

Soldiers shove the man back into the crowd The Brave Boy
that was playing Birnam Wood allows himself a tiny smile
when he sees that The Postman might make it

BETHLEHEM
I want pure blood Someone
like

Bethlehem notes the Boy turns to see the object of his
attention and spots The Postman leaving out the front
gate

BETHLEHEM
That man

Idaho and another soldier are on it The Postman tries to
back away as the two dismount and come toward him

THE POSTMAN
You dont understand

But Idaho and the soldier arent programmed for
explanations -- they grab him

IDAHO
You were required to show
yourself

THE POSTMAN
But Im not with these people
Im just passing through I --

Idaho silences him with a rifle butt to the head
Everything falls OUT OF FOCUS

IDAHO (0S)

Take the mule
DISSOLVE TO

EXT HOLNIST TRAINING CAMP (WESTERN IDAHO) - DAY 11

Spread out in the valley is General Bethlehems Holnist
Expeditionary Force A five hundred-man army enjoying all
the comforts a bivouac can offer

19 head-shaved CONSCRIPTS including Woody and The
Postman are held in a cramped barbed wired pen They
watch as three more are shoved inside One of them is
Bandit 20 He and The Postman come face to face
recognize each other

BANDIT 20
Hi
THE POSTMAN
(astonished)
Hi

The Postman steps toward him Bandit 20 backs off
quickly

BANDIT 20
Well I mean we know each
other kind of

THE POSTMAN
Kind of

BANDIT 20
(looking around)
Wow

THE POSTMAN
So what did you guys do with my
cigarettes

BANDIT 20
We traded them for a woman

THE POSTMAN
Wonderful What happened to your
partners

BANDIT 20
They traded me to the Holnists

GUARD (0S)
Ten hut

General Bethlehem approaches on horseback Colonel Getty
follows behind Bethlehem looks his new recruits over
Dismounting he enters the pen and walks among them

BETHLEHEM
Welcome gentlemen to your new
life You have been born again as
soldiers in the army of the United
Clans of Holn The strong have
been sapped by the whimpering
propaganda of the weak Men
strong men have been denied their
destiny You men have been saved
from that fate Redemption is
within your grasp

He starts down the line looking the men over He stops
in front of a GANGLY RECRUIT The Postman is alongside

BETHLEHEM
You What did you do before you
were given this opportunity

GANGLY RECRUIT
I had a shovel I digged holes

Bethlehem regards him benevolently

BETHLEHEM
You digged holes Well now
youre going to fill them
(turns to Postman)
And you

THE POSTMAN
Me

BETHLEHEM
Is there any question in anyones
mind that I was talking to you
Yes you You look like a

dangerous man Are you

THE POSTMAN
Im just a performer
Shakespeare Stuff like that

BETHLEHEM
Shakespeare

THE POSTMAN
He was a writer He --

BETHLEHEM
I know who Shakespeare was Cry
Havoc and let slip the dogs of
war

Bethlehem says the lines boldly encourages his men to

clap for him

He looks at The Postman expectantly

Finally
THE POSTMAN
I um you want a line
Bethlehem nods The Postman thinks a moment

THE POSTMAN
To be or not to be That is the
question

Bethlehem looks at his men as if to say Is this all this
guys got Bethlehem eyes The Postman he wants a

contest

The Holnists
guy

BETHLEHEM
We few we happy few we band of
brothers

clap they know their General can best this

THE POSTMAN
(gaining confidence)
Now is the winter of our
discontent made glorious summer by

this son of York
Bethlehem claps The Postman on the back

BETHLEHEM
Youre pretty good Youre also a
fighter I see it in your eyes

The Postman doesnt answer Hesitant he doesnt want to
get into any more trouble than hes already in

BETHLEHEM
Dont you agree Come on a mans
got to speak his mind

Bethlehem sounds sincere He seems like a good guy

THE POSTMAN
I dont mean any disrespect sir
but youd be better off just
letting me go A fighter is about
the last thing I am The Postman doubles over as Bethlehem hooks a fist into
his gut Bethlehem clubs him in the head dropping him to
his knees then digs a boot into his side The Postman
goes down

BETHLEHEM
Dont you think I should be the
judge of that soldier

The Postman gasps to catch his breath

BETHLEHEM
Get up I said get up

The Postman staggers to his feet Blood trickles from his
nose as he stares across at Bethlehem

BETHLEHEM
Put up your fists

THE POSTMAN
Youd win

Bethlehem looks to Getty CLICK Getty shoves a PISTOL
is into The Postmans ear The Postman reluctantly raises
his fists Bethlehem gives him a satisfied nod

BETHLEHEM
Now fight

The Postman takes a tentative step forward Bethlehem
drives him back with a flurry of blows The Postman is
dazed nearly out on his feet Bethlehem holds him up

BETHLEHEM
Youre right Youre not a
fighter But you will be Im
giving you a chance at a life that
means something A life worth
living

That said Bethlehem delivers one last blow to The
Postmans face Everything goes BLACK

EXT HOLNIST TRAINING CAMP (WESTERN IDAHO) - DAWN

A brutal REVEILLE BLASTS the sleeping conscripts awake

IDAHO (0S)
Lets move it Everybody up and
at em

12

The Postman comes to He licks his dry blood-caked lips
A sudden movement startles him -- its Woody shoving him
a battered cup of water Its like hes been keeping
watch The Postman is surprised a little suspicious and
very grateful as he gulps the water down

THE POSTMAN
Thanks Did I win

Woody shakes his head no

THE POSTMAN
I tried to tell him

WOODY
Say it again

THE POSTMAN
Say what

WOODY
The words you said in town About
the wind blowing And the rest
Say it again

THE POSTMAN
Blow wind Come wrack At
least well die with the harness
off our back

WOODY
Whats it mean

THE POSTMAN
Live free or die

Woody and The Postman scramble to fall-to with the other
conscripts Idaho surveys the ranks

IDAHO
All right girls Were gonna
run Twenty miles With packs
You got three hours Everybody
makes it Or nobody eats

EXT TRAINING CAMP - MESS LINE - CLOSE ON MEAT - DAY 13
A COOK dumps a scoop of gristly gray meat into each mess
pail as the conscripts wait in line They fall to
ravenously too hungry to taste how bad it is Idaho
supervises

IDAHO
Eat up You got meat tonight

The line has almost passed Just The Postman left and
Bandit 20 bringing up the rear Idaho looks at The
Postman addresses the COOK
IDAHO
Why dont you tell Shakespeare
what kind of meat that is

COOK
Mule

Probably Bill -- and The Postman knows it He stares in
revulsion at the putrid meat ladled into his pail

IDAHO
A godawful animal The sterile
offspring of a horse and a donkey
Can you imagine that Theres no
room in this new world fora
bastard like that

Bandit 20 holds out his pail But the cook wont fill
it

IDAHO
Uh uh
(loudly for all)
Any man last in line aint hungry
enough You show up last you
dont eat

Bandit 20 steps away in disbelief Not knowing what else
to do he sits down beside The Postman the only man with
food who isnt eating

BANDIT 20
Ill die before Im last in line
again

THE POSTMAN
Thats what theyre hoping for

He holds his pail out to Bandit 20

BANDIT 20
Serious This isnt bad

Lost in despair The Postman stares out at the skewed
palette

THE POSTMAN
These were supposed to be the best
years of my life

EXT TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY 14

The conscripts stand at attention under the guard of Idaho
and two other soldiers To their right is a dead oak
tree Behind them three rows of folding chairs

Two figures approach Bethlehem and Getty Getty carries
a sheathed sword Bethlehem surveys the troops -- taking
no more notice of The Postman than anyone else

BETHLEHEM

The laws of eight gentlemen
That is the legacy handed down to
us by Nathan Holn

At the mention of this name the RECRUITS shout as one

RECRUITS
God rest his soul

THE POSTMAN
(low)
May he burn in hell

Getty looks over at him He heard him The Postman
swallows hard Getty stares hard Then he turns away
Hes not going to bust him on it

BETHLEHEM
These are the laws that we live
by The eight is our symbol
Each man will bear it with pride

Bethlehem nods at Idaho who pushes up his own sleeve to
reveal the branded 8

BETHLEHEM
Only then will you be part of the
clan Sit down gentlemen

The men move to sit in one of the three rows Only then
does it become apparent that there are 18 men and only 17
chairs One SLOW RECRUIT is left standing It doesnt
take him long to realize that hes in trouble

BETHLEHEM
Law One You will obey orders
without question
(to Slow Recruit)
I told you to sit

SLOW RECRUIT
(scared)
There werent enough chairs

BETHLEHEM
I didnt specify chairs You
couldve sat down on the ground
The Slow Recruit moves to do so
BETHLEHEM
You disobeyed a direct order You

broke Law One
Idaho and another soldier step up beside the Slow Recruit

BETHLEHEM
Law Two Punishment shall be
swift

They hustle the Recruit to the tree Idaho unslings a
coil of rope throws it over a tree limb They quickly
slip a loop over the Slow Recruits ankles and haul him
upside down into the air

BETHLEHEM
Law Three Mercy is for the weak
Four Terror will defeat reason
Five Your allegiance is to the
clan Six Justice can be
dictated Law Seven Any
clansman may challenge for
leadership of the clan Does any
man here wish to challenge me

There are no takers

BETHLEHEM
On your feet

The conscripts stand like jackknives snapping open
Without a word without a look -- Bethlehem reaches out

and draws a sword from a sheath that Getty holds
Bethlehem steps to the Slow Recruit -- who slowly twists
around
BETHLEHEM
Law Eight There is only one
penalty Death

Bethlehem raises the sword

SLOW RECRUIT
Please Im begging you

THE POSTMAN
As the sword finds its mark Bethlehem looks at him but
addresses all
BETHLEHEM
You will get out of this army what
you put into it Work and youll
be fed Fight and youll be
respected Die and youll be
remembered Its up to you
Bethlehem turns and walks away Getty following behind
The Postman watches as they go Idaho steps up to him

IDAHO
You thinking of challenging for
leadership of the clan

THE POSTMAN
No sir Im a follower not a
leader

IDAHO
You see Colonel Getty Always
following the General Hes the
only man who ever challenged
Fight lasted six seconds but the
General didnt kill him He cut
off his tongue and he cut off his
balls and old Gettys been
following him like a dog ever
since

The Postman looks back to see Bethlehem and Getty
disappear into the gloom Idaho grins likes how this
affects a new man

The Postman moves on Idaho stops Woody as he passes

IDAHO
The General dont see it but I
say you got some nigger in you

Woody clenches his jaw but wisely doesnt answer

EXT PLAINS - DAY

Rain as the army moves Boots suck at the mud War
wagons heave out of ruts A monster gun is mounted on an
old John Deere semi pulled by a team of ten horses The
conscripts fill the middle ranks each bearing a heavy
pack

Marching beside Woody The Postman stares blankly ahead
The cry to halt The conscripts unsling their packs
catch their breath Idaho pulls The Postman out of line

IDAHO
The General would like a word with
you Shakespeare

INT GENERAL BETHLEHEMS TENT - DAY

Bethlehem stands before a painters easel palette in
hand Hes got a mirror set up so he can see his
reflection Hes doing a self-portrait in the tradition
of the great Dutch Masters -- but its a dismal failure

He continues painting even as Idaho leads The Postman in
Idaho salutes steps back For a moment The Postman
doesnt quite know what to do

BETHLEHEM
(re the book and
binoculars on the

Theyre yours A solitary man
arent you Binoculars To watch
life from a distance And
Shakespeare To read about it
instead of living it

Bethlehem wants an answer The Postman clears his throat

THE POSTMAN
No offense General but you seem
to have read some Shakespeare
yourself

BETHLEHEM

If he wishes to rise above mere
thuggery a military commandeer
must be classically educated
Philosophy history Even a sense
of the dramatic

(a beat)
Do you know what I did before the
war Do you think I was in the
army I sold copying machines I
was a salesman The talent to
lead men and devise and execute a
battle plan were locked away
inside me

16 16

He picks up Finding A Way to Win by Nathan Holn A 20-
year-old self-help book

BETHLEHEM
If Nathan Holn hadnt come along
Id still be selling copying
machines Can you imagine the
wasted life Can you imagine the
magnitude of it But war War
gives men like me a chance

He turns to a dog-eared page in the book

BETHLEHEM
Here The prize is often left
unclaimed Have the courage to

grasp it For fortune always
favors the bold
(moved)
It always inspires me
(beat)
I have a design for the future A
master plan Ill need able
officers to carry it out You
have the intelligence If your
heart matches youll go far
(a beat)
Well talk more in the weeks to
come Dismissed

The Postman leaves Idaho stands at the ready

BETHLEHEM
Issue the binoculars to a scout

IDAHO
And the book sir

BETHLEHEM
Burn it

Idaho leaves Bethlehem goes back to his painting He
considers himself in the mirror After a long stare-down
he shouts

BETHLEHEM

wo carbine-toting soldiers stand alertly at guard by a
hicket across the river A rotten wood and rope bridge
pans the space between the ridges

daho rides to the conscripts

IDAHO
One of you dogs has earned himself
a treat Over there

Those men hunted themselves a lion

Anyhow they shot him and he
crawled into that thicket A

Idahos about to hand The Postman a carbine when --

BETHLEHEM (0S)
I dont think so Captain

Bethlehem nods to Getty Getty takes a hunting knife from
a belt-sheath and tosses it blade first into the ground
between The Postmans feet

BETHLEHEM
Come out alive and you got
yourself a lion steak

Hefting the knife The Postman stares at the west ridge
IDAHO
(winks)
Maybe youll find your St Rose up
there
The Postman looks to Bandit 20 who stares back defiantly
IDAHO
What are you waiting for

Christmas

Bandit 20 cant contain his giggling so Idaho backhands
the sound out of him -- then looks back to The Postman

Grim The Postman starts forward looks from the rotten
bridge to the water and back again as he moves

All eyes on him as he starts across

EXT BRIDGE - DAY 20
The Postman steps lightly Far below the river rages A

knotty plank starts to crack underfoot Scooting off it
he takes a last look around Continues across to

EXT WEST RIDGE - DAY 21

The soldiers greet him -- unholy smiles on their ugly
mugs They point him ahead prod him forward toward a
trail of wet blood which leads deeper into the thicket

Stooping The Postman enters The soldiers split off and
track along with him on either side of the thicket

EXT THICKET - DAY

Thorns catch and tear at his clothes as The Postman pushes
his way through He freezes Ahead sprawled and
twisted the mauled bloody corpse of a Holnist soldier

SOLDIER (0S)
Why are you stopping

THE POSTMAN
I found him

SOLDIER (0S)
He alive

Clearly he is not

THE POSTMAN
Yeah

SOLDIER (0S)
Bring him out

The Postman heaves the corpse onto his back Rising
steadying himself he looks back over his shoulders at a
GUTTURAL GROWL He hurries forward

ARMY

Everyone stares across the river straining to see as The
Postman emerges with the corpse on his back

ON BRIDGE

The Postman starts across hampered by his burden He
pauses at his feet the cracked knotty plank

IDAHO
(across river)

Hurry up You still got a lion to
bag

The Postman decides deliberately steps on the PLANK
CRACK The Postman and the corpse drop thirty feet down
disappear in the river below

The corpse surfaces first floats in the water

Then The Postman Farther down the river Swimming
downstream with powerful strokes Between his efforts and
the current hes being quickly swept away from the
Holnists

As Bethlehems eyes narrow in fury

22

A RIFLE BARKS a SHELL BACK after The Postman but he
disappears around a bend in the river

Bethlehem signals to two soldiers They start running
along the east ridge toward the riverbend

Two more start across the bridge to the west -- moving
with military precision

Bethlehem wheels toward the conscripts points out Woody

BETHLEHEM
In the water Come back without
him and you and another man will
die in his place

Woody dives in the water Bethlehem looks to Idaho who
dives in as well Conscripts buzz with nervous
excitement

CONSCRIPTS
Go Go

BANDIT 20
(caught up)
Ill get him sir

He takes off running across the bridge

EXT RIVER - DAY 23

A fallen tree spans the river As The Postman is swept
beneath he reaches up and catches hold Pulling himself
out of the water he scrambles for the west shore He
disappears into the woods as two soldiers appear

They catch hold of the tree look to the west banking see

footprints in the mud where The Postman pulled himself
out They start after him

EXT CLEARING - WOODS - DAY 24

Clothes in tatters his lungs ready to burst The Postman
stops He takes cover as the two soldiers run past

Breathing hard The Postman steps out starts across the
clearing Hes halfway when Bandit 20 steps out from the
trees They look at each other for a moment
THE POSTMAN
Just let me go I dont want to
be part of your army
( )

24

Bandit 20 hesitates for a moment then breaks into a
grin

BANDIT 20
My army I like the sound of
that

The Postman gestures with his knife

THE POSTMAN

Dont --
BANDIT 20
I got him Over --
The Postman lunges digs into Bandit 20s gut He blinks

in surprise then sags to the ground

The Postman takes a step back A shadow falls over him
Its Woody Staring down at The Postman They can hear
others approaching from the river
WOODY
They sent me to kill you

THE POSTMAN
Come with me

At that moment Idaho and the second soldier come into the
clearing Idaho grins relaxes his grip on his gun when
he sees the mismatch between Woody and The Postman

IDAHO
Good boy Get him

WOODY
Its you or me

THE POSTMAN
I know

IDAHO
Finish it

Woody circles The Postman until hes facing Idaho and the
soldier Woody takes a long look at The Postman smiles

WOODY
No harness on my back

As The Postman realizes what hes doing Woody flips his
knife through the air and into the soldiers throat

24 24

As Woody rushes him Idaho raises his GUN
Idaho pumps TWO ROUNDS into Woody but the big man keeps
coming The THIRD ROUND finds his heart puts Woody down
Dead But not before he lands on top of Idaho
As Idaho struggles to get out from under Woodys massive

frame The Postman heads for the trees

Covered in Woodys blood Idaho FIRES a ROUND as The
Postman disappears into the woods Idaho starts after
him

IDAHO

Tracking He sees a dribble of fresh blood He touches
it with his fingers and smiles

He cocks his head at MOVEMENT to his left Smiling
hefting his pistol Idaho moves in More SHUFFLING Just
ahead Hes got him now

IDAHO
You want your St Rose

Theres a RUSTLE of BRUSH just before a ROAR splits the
air Idaho doesnt even have time to scream as the LION
pounces down on top of him

EXT CLIFF - DAY 25

The Postman lungs heaving stops his climb long enough to
take stock of the Army waiting on the distant river edge

Strength ebbing he heaves himself up and continues
climbing

DISSOLVE TO

EXT WOODS (EASTERN OREGON) - NIGHT 26
A chilling RAIN drills down washing across an old forest
road Covered with undergrowth and dotted with saplings
nothings been down here in years
Blue-lipped and shivering his clothes torn and soaked
The Postman trudges along He tries to rub some warmth
back into his numbed limbs but a coughing spell wracks
his body

He trudges forward shoes heavy with freezing mud Hes
made his escape but he wont last the night if he doesnt

find some shelter

An unnatural shape ahead just off the road Square He
cautiously pulls back a few branches

An old rusted Jeep with faded US government markings
Its hood buried under the dirt of an old mud slide The
Postman stoops to look through the passenger side window
comes face-to-face with death A skeleton sits inside
the skull grinning against the glass facing The Postman

But The Postman doesnt jump back He just stares The
two heads meet halfway as The Postmans face is reflected
on the glass superimposed over the skull

A hypothermic shiver wracks his body The Postman tries
the door but it wont budge The other side of the Jeep
is buried But seeing that the windshield is partly
smashed he clears away the debris peels back the spider-
webbed safety glass and climbs inside

JEEP

Pulling the glass back down he looks almost shyly at the
skeleton like two kids about to park for the first
time

THE POSTMAN
Hey How ya doin

The back of the Jeep is filled with bags marked US Mail
The Postman picks up a hat off the console Oddly
respectful he runs a finger along the band over the
Horse and Rider emblem

The Postman reaches touches the embroidered American flag
patch on the skeletons jacket shoulder Another shiver

A moment later The Postman is pulling the nice dry jacket
off the skeleton and shoving his own arms inside

A sloshing sound He pats down the jacket Finds a
liquor He gives the skeleton a you shouldnt have
look But the cap wont budge He twists pries bangs
the neck of the steering wheel At last it gives He
takes a long hard swallow The warming fire streams down
his throat

The Postman grabs a random letter reads it aloud THE POSTMAN
Jerry Ball Pine View

He starts to open it looks at the skeleton and shrugs

THE POSTMAN
So arrest me
(reading)
Heres a piece of good news
Jerrys decided to go to school to
get his contractors license

Tossing it aside he takes a drink opens another The
words are in crayon -- a childs scrawl

THE POSTMAN
(smiles to skeleton)
Little Jimmy wants his grandpa to
know he lost a tooth

The Postman turns the envelope over in his palm A tiny
tooth falls out The Postman considers it This suddenly
isnt so amusing He puts it back in the envelope

Shoving mail sacks aside he climbs in the back

Burrowing in he pulls the sacks back covering himself
with a blanket of mail Getting warmer already he

regards the skeleton a beat as the RAIN DRUMS ON the ROOF

EXT JEEP - DAY

Wearing the blue uniform The Postman looks down at the
fresh grave realizes a eulogy is in order He takes off
the hat holds it over his chest for a heartfelt moment of
silence

THE POSTMAN
Thanks for being there for me
(raising the flask)
Heres to you I consider my
taxes very well spent

He swallows the last few drops then sets the flask down
as a headstone What now

THE POSTMAN
All dressed up Nowhere to go

EXT RURAL HIGHWAY (SOMEWHERE IN OREGON) - DAY

His hair growing back nicely The Postman has reached the
proverbial fork in the road He considers his two
options Pine View -- 32 miles Or Ridgemont -- 220
miles He looks the two roads over thinks

THE POSTMAN
Well thats easy

The townspeople welcome him with cheers The Postman
raises a silencing hand As they quiet

Yes there is If there are dogs

them while Im here

Only The Postman laughs No one else reacts Briscoe

watches dubiously from the wall as the people surround The
Postman and sweep him through the gates and into town

One couple watches The Postman closely as he makes his way
into town She is ABBY -- a sweet-faced pretty woman

Her husband MICHAEL is a decent-looking sort tall and
strong

THE POSTMAN
The important thing to remember
about cars is you cant eat ‘em

Ahead people are gathered inside an old Fosters Freeze

INT FOSTERS FREEZE (PINE VIEW) - NIGHT

The townspeople fill the booths line the walls They
talk excitedly amongst themselves break into spontaneous
applause as Ford and The Postman enter

The Postman is surprised uncomfortable at this display
But then he sees that a banquet has been laid out on the
counter The centerpiece is a huge vat of steaming stew

The PEOPLE clear a path for him

MAN 1

A clamor of Holnist questions

ELLEN

After a moment Briscoe leaves

INT FOSTERS FREEZE - LATER 36

A band plays an odd array of instruments Theres
dancing The Postman sits behind four empty bowls
People watch him eat like it was a religious experience
He pushes back the fifth bowl

THE POSTMAN
Never thought Id hear myself say

Hes cut off by the sight of a silent little boy The
kids looking up staring intently at something

THE POSTMAN

(re the cap)
This

The boy nods The Postman shakes his head and smiles to

himself He takes off the cap sets it on the kids head

THE POSTMAN
Almost fits

The boys eyes go wide with wonder His stocks gone up
1000 Before he can rush off to impress his friends
ELLEN -- his mother -- steps over and gently chides him

ELLEN
Thats not a toy honey Thats

The boy carefully removes the cap hands it back to The
Postman Ellen smiles gratefully and gently guides her
son away

The Postman shrugs turns to find Abby the pretty woman
we saw at the Pine View gates She smiles at The Postman

ABBY
Would you like to dance

THE POSTMAN

Stunned The Postman stops dancing Abby takes this

moment to grab Michael

THE POSTMAN
(to himself)
Its got to be the uniform

Abby takes Michaels arm introduces him proudly

ABBY

Michael smiles shakes hands with a grave-diggers grip
The Postman doesnt know what to think

ABBY

The Postman just stares at them Abby looks to Michael
ABBY
He hasnt said no 36
MICHAEL
(undaunted)
What do you say mister Youd be

doing us a favor

THE POSTMAN
Ill have to think about it

The Postman excuses himself with a nod and turns away
shaking his head at the strangeness of this new world

But no rest for the wicked as soon as hes free from Abby

and Michael

hes running smack into another group of

well-wishing TOWNIES Mrs March is among them Shes
holding an envelope

TOWNIE 1
Mrs March wants to give you
something

(to Mrs March)
Hes right here Irene

MRS MARCH

The Postman swallows hard looks from the envelope to the
faces around him to Mrs March She looks blindly back
How can he lie to her

THE POSTMAN
Look Mrs March you should know

that

MRS MARCH

THE POSTMAN

But she stops him grabs for his hand

MRS MARCH

Her hand leaves his and she disappears into the crowd
Shes left him with her letter and no choice at all

THE POSTMAN
I got to get out of here

EXT PINE VIEW - NIGHT 37

The Postman moves through town The streets are deserted
Hes got his pack on his mailbag He passes a 7-11
converted to a blacksmith shop Theres a horse tethered
to the railing in front of it He grins maybe hes going
to make it out of here after all As he starts to move
toward the horse

OLD MAN (0S)
Its right around the corner

An OLD MAN sits on his porch across the street

THE POSTMAN
(freezes startled)
What is

OLD MAN
What youre looking for

The Old Man winks knowingly then heads inside As The
Postman turns the corner he finds himself in front of the
post office An old brick building Chiseled in the
granite facing UNITED STATES POST OFFICE EST 1884

INT POST OFFICE (PINE VIEW) - NIGHT 38

Long ago stripped it still has a proud official almost
holy feel The Postman wanders in stops to read the
credo calligraphied on the wall Neither snow nor
rain He turns at a SOUND Ford is here leaning
against a wall

FORD
I knew youd come here

THE POSTMAN
You did huh

Ford nods A sage sixteen-year-old

FORD
How do you get to be a postman

THE POSTMAN

THE POSTMAN

FORD

Ford raises his right hand palm out ready to take the
oath It takes The Postman a moment to realize

THE POSTMAN
The organizations kinda shaky
It might not last

FORD

THE POSTMAN
Youd meet a lot of people who
dont believe in you

FORD
Ill set them straight

THE POSTMAN
Its a lonely job

FORD

This response strikes a chord The Postman sees how badly
Ford wants something to hold onto He sees himself

THE POSTMAN
So have I Ford So have I

The Postman looks up at the creed on the wall Finally THE POSTMAN
What the hell Repeat after me

POSTMAN FORD
(repeating)
Neither snow nor rain nor heat

of their appointed rounds

BRISCOE

These people dont need dreams
Mr Postman They need something

(as The Postman

doesnt answer)
Didnt think so All you cost us

dont ever want to see you again

Briscoe exits leaves The Postman alone in the post

knocking over a stack of letters that have been shoved
under the door He gathers them up flips through them
Theyre written on scraps the backs of pictures on
handkerchiefs and homemade paper They arent old

Theyre brand new Shaking his head he closes the door

The Postman has no sooner done so when theres a KNOCK on
the window He looks over at a woman She shrugs

smiles holds up a letter The Postman sighs hes
trapped in here

Abby laughs The Postman is charmed

ABBY
Youre funny Hardly anyones

THE POSTMAN
I guess no one feels much like
laughing

The two of them just look at each other a moment Abby
fingers the ribbon in her hair

ABBY
Have you decided yet

THE POSTMAN
Oh well Ive been thinking about

A beat Abby lets her shift drop to the floor then
slides under the sheets alongside him

THE POSTMAN
Sure Why not

They lie there awkwardly for a moment He looks at her

THE POSTMAN

You dont even know my name

ABBY

Theyve been waiting for him starving for him

Ford steps up hands him another fresh packet of letters
The Postman sees that Ford hangs on to four or five

THE POSTMAN
What about those

FORD

The Postman scans the crowd Looking for Abby maybe
THE POSTMAN
(absently)

uncomfortably The Postman looks out at the crowd They
crave hope He should probably just keep his mouth shut

THE POSTMAN
Times seem hard right now But
you have to believe its getting
better Birds are migrating
again The rains are back

The people consider him and then each other By God they
do feel hopeful Suddenly Ellen her little boy by her
side begins to sing Its weak at first but one-by-one
the others join in Soon the whole town is singing

ELLEN and TOWN

The guilt is overwhelming He digs his heels into the

horses flanks and rides out of town

The Postman continues Caught in an inner turmoil
Briscoe reaches into his pocket and pulls out a letter
He turns it over in his hands looks off at The Postman

BRISCOE

Briscoe urges his horse forward catches up He hands The
Postman the letter then rides back for town The Postman
watches Briscoe The people lining the wall And he
realizes just what effect hes had Theres nothing to
do but shrug his shoulders and ride Strains of
AMERICA still ECHO hauntingly OVER

sacred
(to horse)
All in all not a bad gig huh

The HORSE SNORTS Smiling The Postman shoves the

envelope into his bag As he does he finds something
else The red ribbon He runs it through his fingers
thinks wistfully of Abby Then like a knight of old
representing a ladys honor he ties it to his mailbag and
rides on

first-rate piece of ass

Michael overhears He looks over as Bethlehems men nod
in agreement Michael sees that theyre talking about
Abby

BETHLEHEM
Tell the Sheriff I want to be
introduced She does not belong

Excuse me

BETHLEHEM

married woman

BETHLEHEM

the bride on the wedding night

MICHAEL
Me and Abby have been married for

Horrified The Postman steps forward but rifles are on
him All he can do is watch The Mayor is the first to
go down

BETHLEHEM

Bethlehem turns his attention to the battle A CAPTAIN
steps forward with gun raised

CAPTAIN
(by rote)
In accordance with law eight and
by the authority of Emergency
Order 46 you are hereby --

A CRACK of RIFLE FIRE The Captains forehead explodes
and he falls to the ground

Shocked Bethlehem whirls for the source of the GUNFIRE
Abby FIRING from a position behind a supply wagon

But even as Bethlehem turns an ARROW SINGS in and lodges
in his arm Fired from a pocket of sentries up on the

palisade Bethlehem bellows in outrage and pain

The Postman takes advantage of the moment of chaos to grab
the fallen Captains gun

He pulls a Holnist rider from his horse and swings into
the saddle The unhorsed rider goes for his gun But
once more SHOTS RING OUT and he goes down

Bethlehem ducks as another BULLET ZINGS close Too close

BETHLEHEM
Get her

Two soldiers move forward

Suddenly The Postmans HORSE comes THUNDERING -- trampling
the Holnist nearest him

The other Holnist hears looks back sees The Postman
coming and takes aim just as The Postman brings his gun to
bear

The Holnist FIRES first We dont see the hit Just
watch as The Postman FIRES an answering ROUND The
Holnist goes down

The Postman reins up alongside the wagon Grunting with
pain he reaches down takes Abbys arm and swings her up
behind him Then digs his heels in for all hes worth

More Holnists come on the run They FIRE The HORSE
SNORTS in pain Hes hit But The Postman urges him on
heading into the woods

Bethlehem snaps off the arrow shaft and shouts

BETHLEHEM

shot in the belly

The horse is failing Near death

We hear the sound of PURSUING CAVALRY Abby urges the
horse off the road When the thicket grows too dense
Abby jumps down She catches The Postman as he slides
off easing him to the ground

THE POSTMAN
(disoriented)
Abby

Abby shushes him She pulls on the horses bridle to
force him farther along But its no good the wounded

horse goes down on its knees

And five RIDERS THUNDER past Fooled All but the SIXTH

In the deep bg flames lick at the billowing black
smoke The town is burning

his rifle from the saddle boot and starts into the

beside him rifle in hand The Sixth Soldier appears

He hesitates at first Then dismounts and moves toward
her Abby cocks the rifle

used it by now

Moving closer still he doesnt see the BRANCH pulled back
in The Postmans hand until it SNAPS hard into his face

He stumbles back

ABBY
Youre right

Abby dashes out rifle in hand She swings for the
bleachers The butt catches the side of the Sixth

pilfers through the Soldiers gear She takes everything
of value a knife bullets a canteen His eyes flutter

The action presses his Adams apple against the blade

catches his right wrist as he attempts to salute So
Chubby salutes with the left hand instead As they line

up

THE POSTMAN
Just stay safe and remember The

The sun just peeks up over the horizon At that signal
the carriers thunder off the ground trembling under them
The look on their faces The glory of it all Theyre
alive The Postman hesitates watches after them a

moment

sent Bethlehem the bodies

THE POSTMAN
Why

FORD
Because Bethlehem has to know that
were not going to stop THE POSTMAN
God damn you Ford Those people
down there are dying because of
us Because of what we did

FORD
Bullshit Theyre dying because
of Bethlehem Theyre dying
because this is a shitty world
And if were ever going to change
it then somebody might have to
die If I could make it be me
down there I would But I cant

disband the Postal Service of the
restored United States You are
to burn your uniforms and The
Postman is to return to
Minneapolis at once Thank you
and that is all

A hushed silence The Postman walks away The carriers

Ford catches up with The Postman He stares at The

Postman The Postman stares back

THE POSTMAN

down as The Postman and Abby trudge along

Up ahead a rail-road tunnel promises shelter from the

storm

THE POSTMAN
(re the tunnel)
We can rest in there

Abby is quick to agree

Out of the corner of his eye The Postman catches a blur

of movement

He turns his head quickly but hes barely in time to see
a wooden basket attached to one of the high wires swing

from a distant tower Theres a

sentry inside it

The basketed sentry whistles away at 40 mph heading

straight for an adjacent tower
hes lost from view

In a matter of seconds

BC MAYOR

THE POSTMAN
Thanks Shes not my wife

The exchange cuts Abby like a knife She gets up and
leaves The Mayor keeps his council -- not sure what to
make of this arrangement

THE POSTMAN

lights

BC MAYOR

THE POSTMAN

BC MAYOR
Why dont you take the night to
think Decide if thats what you
really want

152 EXT BRIDGE - NIGHT

Fog obscures the east end A sentry squints at the
MUFFLED CLOP of HOOVES The mist parts to reveal seventy
yards away three Holnist scouts on horseback

Emissaries from hell

As the sentry blows a whistle

BRIDGE

As word spreads folks move down the bridge for a look
Eating their bread The Postman Abby and the carriers
join them

( )

152

EAST END
The Mayor stands across from the lead scout -- conferring

Finally the Mayor points him back the way he came The
lead scout doesnt budge spots The Postman in the crowd

He and The Postman seem to stare at each other forever
Then with a flick of the reins hes gone The other two
follow Swallowed up by the misty evening gloom The
Postmans head swims dizzily Its not over

The Mayor returns to dozens of nervous questions

BC MAYOR
Theyre looking for The Postman

BC MAN
No such thing anymore

BC MAYOR
Man on the horse says there is
Says he thinks hes here Says
hes coming back with friends

A little BOY steps forward sings out

BC BOY
Whats a postman

A silent moment Its been so long no ones sure how to
answer The Postman looks down at the ground The
carriers exchange deflated looks Then

ABBY
(stepping forward)
You never heard of a postman

He shakes his head no Seems a shame As The Postman
looks over at Abby she takes a page from his book

ABBY
There used to be a postman for
every street in America They
wore uniforms And hats Like
this one

She goes to The Postmans gear returns with his postal
cap Sets it on the boys head

BC BOY
Wow ABBY

My postman knew the name of every
kid on my street He knew our
birthdays Hed even find the
baseballs youd hit down the
street I can still see the smile
on his face The tip of his cap

-- when he had a letter in his bag
with my name on it Mine always
came just after school You could
set your watch by him Unless you
were waiting on something special
-- like a present from somewhere
far away or a letter from your
sweetheart Then it seemed like
hed never come I used to think
they could make time stand still

Several other listeners nod -- theyre completely with
her

ABBY

I dont think we ever really
understood what they meant to us
until they were gone Getting a
letter made you feel like you were
part of something bigger than
yourself No place was ever too
far away for the postman So
nobody ever had to be alone The
postman was someone you could
count on Things just made more
sense when they were around

(beat)
Thats the kind of world we used
to have A world a lot of us took
for granted And now weve got
this one And it makes me
wonder -- what kind of world do I
want my child to live in I want
my child to live in a world where
hopes and dreams arent just lies
you tell yourself to get through
another day I want my child and
I want my friends -- I want all of
us to live in a world where you
still get your mail

Its a moment before anyone speaks
BC MAYOR
(to The Postman)

Are you The Postman The Postman takes the cap off the little boys head
touches the emblem and answers

THE POSTMAN

Yes

BC MAYOR

THE POSTMAN

sudden Im not wearing the right
clothes

And as he puts on his cap he accepts the mantle as well

EXT BRIDGE - CLOSE ON PINE BOX - MORNING

steady it and bring it gently to the ground Its one of
many

The Postman and Abby gasp as the Mayor opens the lid to
reveal 20 well-oiled rifles and 15 pistols with ammo
The Postman blinks over at the Mayor

BC MAYOR
Fact that we dont allow em

THE POSTMAN
Im sorry Ive brought this on

BC MAYOR
No need to be sorry Long as we

PONYTAIL (0S)

The Postman looks over to see Ponytail Drew and Chubby

ride up Like him they are back in uniform

THE POSTMAN
The order was to burn all
uniforms

The carriers look away -- sheepish

153

THE POSTMAN
You know what to do then

PONYTAIL

a difference

CHUBBY SENTRY

ABBY
This is hard for me
(beat)
Michael was the best man I ever

the words)
I dont know why Ive been so

THE POSTMAN
Abby do you think a lie can

ABBY (CONTD)

feel like he was part of the
world You give out hope like it
was candy in your pocket

He starts to speak She stops him taking his hand

ABBY
When you come back well be
waiting here for you So you can
take us to St Rose

The Postman lets go of her hand and starts for the basket

The Mayor gestures to the line of towers extending into
the distance

BC MAYOR
Theres three good-sized towns up
that way Enough folks to be a
big help to you If you can
convince them to come

As The Postman steps into the basket he makes the mistake
of looking over the edge Its a long long way down

BC MAYOR
A lot higher than it looks huh

The Postman looks at the contraption with more than a
little trepidation The Mayor grins

BC MAYOR
Dont tell anybody but I like to
ride the damn thing just for the
hell of it Being a city official
has its perks

He winks and as he reaches for the release pin The
Postmans hand meets his there

BC MAYOR
Trust me man Thisll get you
there a lot faster

How do I stop --

But its too late The Mayor releases the pin BC MAYOR

He steps away to get a better vantage point of the
approaching army He reaches out -- Getty hands him a
pair of binoculars

BETHLEHEM

(donning a pair of

leather gloves)
Only thing worse than a coward is
one who cant count Lieutenant
do yourself a favor Die well in
this battle In my army a
deserters life is a brief and
unpleasant one

Bethlehem watches The Postman through the binoculars -- a
hint of a smile on his face

BETHLEHEM
(to himself)
At last someone with courage
enough to bring the fight to me

A Holnist soldier stands by with Bethlehems horse The
General mounts -- the model of military calm and
precision Getty reins up beside him

THE POSTMAN
Youre no fucking general Youre
a copying machine salesman
Youre not even a good painter

BETHLEHEM

fight

THE POSTMAN
Wouldnt it be great if wars could
be fought just by the assholes who
started them We could settle
this thing right here You and

me

BETHLEHEM
Unfortunately it doesnt work
that way

THE POSTMAN
It does in your army

The Postman kicks his horse up into a gallop and rides up
the Holnist line No one least of all Bethlehem is sure
whats going on

THE POSTMAN
I invoke law seven of the Laws of

leadership of the clan

BETHLEHEM
What

The Postman wheels his horse around

THE POSTMAN
I challenge you

Bethlehem is caught completely by surprise but recovers

BETHLEHEM
Youre not a Holnist Youre not
a member of the clan You dont
have the right

The Postman rolls up his sleeve He rides the Holnist
lines displaying his brand for all to see The Holnists
murmur amongst themselves

THE POSTMAN
I have every right I invoke law

seven
Bethlehem cant believe his eyes

THE POSTMAN
I challenge for leadership of the
clan

The seed of doubt is planted Is Bethlehem violating one

of the Laws of Eight The men look at one another Gibbs

looks to Getty Bethlehem looks from The Postmans tattoo
to his face

BETHLEHEM
Where do I know you from

THE POSTMAN
Cry Havoc And let slip the dogs
of war Remember that

BETHLEHEM
Shakespeare The one who didnt
want to fight

THE POSTMAN
I shouldve found a way to kill
you then But you seemed so
strong

BETHLEHEM
Law seven it is
(to all)
This war is settled here As The Postman nods in agreement
They take their positions -- and without a word -- they

kick their horses into a charge Coming straight for each
other like medieval jousters

Bethlehem reaches for his sword But before it clears the
scabbard The Postman lunges

The horses collide Bethlehem and The Postman hit the
ground hard

Holnists and Carriers alike begin to move forward for a
better look

The fight is fierce Bloody The Postman and Bethlehem
are at each other like coiled snakes

Its more of a fight than any of the Holnists --

especially Getty -- expected The spectators pull in
tighter

Both combatants have taken a beating -- and still they
fight on -- trading bloody raw-knuckled punches

One of Bethlehems connects The Postman loses his
footing hits the ground -- knocking his head on a rock
with a resounding CRACK Dazed hes slow to rise

Its just the moment Bethlehem needs he straddles the
fallen Postman reaches for his knife with one hand --
grabs The Postmans throat with the other

BETHLEHEM
I study people I know your
problem Do you know why you
cant fight

The Postman cant answer

BETHLEHEM
You have nothing to fight for
You dont care about anything
You dont value anything You
dont believe in anything Thats
what makes me better

The Postman grabs Bethlehems knife-hand -- using all his
remaining strength to keep him at bay

THE POSTMAN
(barely audible)
I believe in the United States
Postal Service The Postman lets go of Bethlehems hands grabs his belt
and pulls him over As they roll to their feet The
Postman club-fists Bethlehem on the side of the head

THE POSTMAN
Neither snow

(wham )
Nor rain

(wham )
Nor heat

(wham )
Nor gloom of night

(wham )
Will stay this courier from the
swift completion of his appointed
rounds

Bethlehem reels stumbling back The Postman pounces on
top of him begins to strangle him Bethlehem tries to
pry the fingers from his throat but cant Hes going to
die

The Postman is urged on By both sides Holnists
Carriers Ford Even Holnist Luke He looks up at the
faces -- and finally lets Bethlehem go The General gasps
for breath

As Ponytail and Chubby move forward to untie Ford The
Postman looks to both sides

THE POSTMAN
It doesnt have to be this way
We dont have to kill each other
We can live together We can --

Ford takes Chubbys pistol sets it against the side of
Bethlehems head

FORD
Law three Mercy is for the weak

THE POSTMAN
Ford dont

Bethlehem shakes his head -- doesnt want him to either
FORD
Law eight There is only one
penalty and that penalty is death

Fords going to shoot

165 THE POSTMAN
He isnt worth it Im the head
of the clan now There are going
to be new laws
(to all)
Law one No more killing
Theres going to be peace

The Postman looks at carriers and Holnists alike

THE POSTMAN
Who else Who else has a law

WOMAN
Everyone has to learn how to read

THE POSTMAN
Thats law two Who else

CARRIER 1
Three Liberty and justice for
all
LUKE
Four No more tattoos
CARRIER 2
Law five Give peace a chance

HOLNIST SOLDIER 2
Law six Mercy is its okay

CARRIER 3

The Postman nods solemnly looks to Ford
THE POSTMAN
How about it Ford Lincoln
Mercury You give us law eight

Ford grits his teeth

THE POSTMAN
(close -- for Ford)

Be a leader Ford

FORD
Law eight

Ford FIRES Bethlehem flinches then sags as he realizes
Ford has fired into the ground FORD
Live and let live

The Postman smiles in relief as Ford lowers the revolver
and starts to hand the weapon over

Forgotten for an instant Bethlehem makes a last wild
lunge grabs Fords gun

As Bethlehem aims at The Postman a SHOT rings out Hit
in the chest Bethlehem blinks in amazement before he
falls to the ground dying Getty has shot him

BETHLEHEM
Would I had bestowed that time in
the tongues that I have in
fencing dancing and bear-baiting
Oh had I but followed the arts

He dies

THE POSTMAN
Grow like savages -- as soldiers
will -- that nothing do but
mediate on blood

Getty throws his rifle on the ground Other weapons are
laid down The war at long last is over

THE POSTMAN
Somebody take a letter

CHUBBY
Huh

THE POSTMAN
A letter

DISSOLVE TO

INT ABBYS PLACE (BRIDGE CITY) - DAY

Abby in bed holding her new baby in her arms Shes
reading a letter What she reads makes her smile She
puts the letter down and cuddles her baby

ABBY
Your daddy wrote to tell you that
hell be here as soon as he can
And that he loves you very much

Abby looks up to see The Postman standing at her door
She looks at him smiling with tears in her eyes

THE POSTMAN
Mails slow Ill have to see
about that

Abby smiles down at the child in her arms

ABBY
Your daughter Her name is Hope

The Postman takes the tiny child in his arms

WOMAN (VO)
And so my father returned home
after the Holnists were
defeated

EXT ST ROSE - DAY

A beach town No wall no sentries just cottages lining
a dozen sand-swept streets A crowd has gathered to hear
The Postmans daughter HOPE mid-thirties speak Beside
her a bearded 52-year-old Ford in his postmasters
uniform They stand before a large tarp-draped statue
HOPE
But he never did see St Rose
There was too much to be done
Hed made a promise and in keeping
it -- he traded one dream for
another With no regrets And
so in honor of my father

She unveils the statue weve seen this before Its The
Postman on his horse low-slung in the saddle leaning

down to pluck the letter from the Little Boys hand

Theres an OLDER MAN in the audience who seems especially
moved by the statue Theres a younger man beside him

OLDER MAN
That was me

As St Rose applauds

FADE OUT

THE END
