OVER BLACK 1
We HEAR the opening strains of a lush classic orchestral theme
AS WE FADE IN

Slowly SPIRALLING DOWNWARD towards an ancient embossed STORY BOOK
its cover boasting the TITLE of the story we’re about to tell

“ENCHANTED”
The story book opens with a sudden SNAP catching us off guard as
we realize it’s a POP-UP BOOK an ornately detailed paper castle

springing into view A sonorous NARRATOR says the words

NARRATOR (VO)
Once upon a time

As we slowly DOLLY towards this modest cardboard castle it
DISSOLVES with disarming vividness into a breathtakingly lush

EXT ANIMATED KINGDOM - DAY 2

ANIMATED WORLD Soaring waterfalls circle the castle the water
feeding the hungry vegetation that climbs up towards its spires

NARRATOR (VO)
In an enchanted kingdom known as Andalasia
there ruled an evil queen named Narissa

We MOVE further up the castle

NARRATOR (VO) (contd)
Selfish and vain her greatest fear was
that one day she’d be forced to hand her
crown over to her step-son Prince Edward

Past the lush greenery and ancient stones to

ROYAL GUARD (0S)
Come back here you little thief

EXT A CASTLE SPIRE - CONTINUOUS 3

Chased by a ROYAL GUARD a determined chipmunk PIP LEAPS out of
a window holding a gold HAIR BRUSH letting out a sudden SQUEAK

As he’s suddenly caught in MID-AIR by the Guard’s beefy hand
GUARD

Gotcha That’s the last knickknack you’1l
ever walk out with
Pip looks up at him fearless his defiant voice more Brooklyn
mobster than cute chipmunk

PIP
Ah kiss my acorns you dumb palooka

GUARD
Who you calling dumb You’re the one who
finally got caught

PIP
Stuff it meathooks You couldn’t catch a
cold in January
The guard SQUEEZES harder smiling sadistically
GUARD
You got a big mouth for a little guy Im

gonna enjoy teaching you a lesson Pip

PIP
Me first fat boy

RAKING the HAIR out of the brush Pip stuffs it in his cheeks

PIP (cont’d)
Always use your head

»-and HURLS the brush at the Guard’s HEAD with a BONK

GUARD
Ow You little vermin

Pip JUMPS from his grip the GUARD LUNGING in vain as Pip LEAPS on
a nearby branch and into the forest yelling with his mouth full

PIP
See ya next time Charlie Kisses to the
missus
EXT THE FOREST - CONTINUOUS 4

We ZOOM with Pip through the woods the chipmunk moving so fast we
soon lose him completely Trying to catch up we come to

EXT A FOREST CLEARING — CONTINUOUS 5

The branches PARTING to reveal a quaint TREE HOUSE with painted
shutters and flower boxes We DISSOLVE INTO
INT THE TREE HOUSE -— CONTINUOUS 6

A line of friendly forest animals SKUNK RABBIT FAWN POSSUM and
BLUEBIRDS pass found forest items nuts and pine cones and twigs
up to a beautiful young maiden propped on a stool Giselle

Gentle and sweet with sparkling eyes and long blonde hair Giselle
carefully GLUES the objects to a life-sized ‘prince’ statue Pip
suddenly appears pushing his way to the front of the line

PIP
Okay okay Step aside you slobs Coming
through here Special delivery
(making his way up to Giselle)
Giselle honey You ain’t gonna believe
this Sometimes I even amaze myself

GISELLE
(hopefully)
Pip You‘ve been to the castle again

Pip reaches in his mouth and COUGHS up the hairball presenting it
to her like it’s gold Giselle marvels at in thrilled disbelief

GISELLE (cont’d)
Oh my goodness Could this be
Is it really

PIP
The genuine article Straight from da
royal brush

A delighted Giselle takes the bit of hair as if it’s pure gold

GISELLE
Oh Pip However did you

PIP
(a hush and a cautious hand)
Better maybe you don’t know honey

GISELLE
The pine needles would have been just fine
but this iswonderful

PIP
Hey Giselle For you Anything You’re
family And family takes care of family

Giselle gives Pip an appreciative kiss on the head as she tugs on
the ‘prince’ hair SNAPPING it into a perfect CURL she attaches
the hair to the statue’s forehead smiling
GISELLE
There we go Perfect

Her eyes suddenly wide in alarm as she realizes

GISELLE (cont’d)
Oh my goodness

PIP
What What’s the problem

GISELLE
He hasn’t any lips

Pip quickly SNAPS at the other animals to come up with some ideas

SKUNK
(handing her an acorn)
What about this

GISELLE
Too small

RABBIT
(passing up a pine cone)
How about this

GISELLE
Too big

FAWN
Does he have to have lips

GISELLE
Of course What kind of prince would he be
without lips

PIP
Hungry

GISELLE
I meant a prince needs lips for the most
important thing a prince can do
(almost solemnly)
True love’s kiss

BLUEBIRDS (IN UNISON)
Are you going to kiss the prince

GISELLE
Me
(coyly)
Don’t be silly Prince Edward and I
(MORE )
GISELLE (contd)
(a yearning SIGH)
It’s almost too much to hope for I
couldn’t even begin to dream of it

WE PULL OUT WIDE to reveal that Giselle has indeed imagined it

Her entire room is a testament to a teen-girl obsession with him
‘prince’ needlepoints heart-filled doodles along with a lot of
Pip’s ‘found’ prince objects hats boots and chunks of armor

GISELLE (cont’d)
(smiling wistfully)
Then again you have to dream about
something

SONG 1 — TRUE LOVES KISS 7

Searching around her room for a suitable pair of ‘lips’ Giselle
begins to sing about all the things she dreams and hopes for in
her life falling in love with the prince marrying living in the
castle happily ever after (in whatever specifics and sequence that
best serve the story and song)

Finding only an old sock a dissatisfied Giselle SWINGS open her
front door

EXT THE TREE HOUSE — CONTINUOUS 8

Still singing she wanders into the meadow that surrounds her tree
house the animals in tow as she continues singing

Twirling through the glen Giselle picks up ‘found’ objects in
search of her ‘statue’ princes ‘lips’ (leaves caterpillars a
flower) perhaps comically “trying them on for size” as she
sings to see if theyll work for Edward

All of Giselle’s specific hopes and dreams ultimately embodied
(and validated) in the cohesive romantic theme that threads
throughout our storyTRUE LOVES KISS

As the musicchorussinging continues we hear

A NEARBY CHORUS OF ROYAL TRUMPETS 9
Giselle’s eyes light up

GISELLE
Do you hear that It’s him

Before anyone can even notice Giselle has already dashed into the
woods Pip takes off after her admonishing the other animals

PIP
You heard her Hurry it up ya mokes

EXT ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - A MOMENT LATER 10

A giant UGLY TROLL suddenly LANDS on the ground with a CRASH hog-
tied from feet to head Riding the reigns on its lassoed head
like a chariot is a handsome dashing young man PRINCE EDWARD

ROYAL TRUMPETERS flank the troll blasting a triumphant herald as
a smiling Edward tosses his hair posing like a big game hunter

A stubby Igor-like man RUNS up to join him Edward’s snivelling
obsequious squire NATHANIEL A grand show of proclaiming

NATHANIEL
All hail Prince Edward of Andalasia

The trumpets echo their praise as Nathaniel fawns over the prince

NATHANIEL (contd)
That’s ten trolls this month That’s a new
record Your stepmother the queen will be
so pleased Deliriously happy

PRINCE EDWARD
I suppose she will be It was a grand
hunt A triumph as always and yet
(sighing he leans thoughtfully on the troll’s nose)
Sometimes I long for a grander prize

Turning away an annoyed Nathaniel rolls his eyes mocking the
prince as he mouths along to the Prince’s now familiar lament

PRINCE EDWARD (cont‘d)
A beautiful young maiden My heart’s one
desire My one and only

Nathaniel quickly turning back in a display of fawning devotion

NATHANIEL
Yes Some gorgeous little thing’s waiting
on you in the hinterlands I’m sure And
well find her Don’t worry No matter
how impossibly far away she might be

As if on cue we suddenly HEAR Giselle singing very nearby

GISELLE (0S)
“True love’s kiss”

PRINCE EDWARD
(cupping his hand to hear)
What a glorious sound Do you hear that
Nathaniel

NATHANIEL
(suddenly pale with alarm)
Me No All I hear is silence Dead
silence Like a tomb

Edward leaps onto his pure white steed

PRINCE EDWARD
I must find the maiden that belongs to that
sweet voice Ride Destiny

Edward dives into the forest in search of this enchanting girl A
look of sheer panic crosses Nathaniel’s face

NATHANIEL
Oh no This is not happening

Suddenly he hears an oafish melancholy voice echoing the song

TROLL
“Twoooluvvvvv’skissss”

Nathaniel looks down to see the bound troll singing to himself
Inspired he turns to the troll nodding towards Giselle’s voice

NATHANIEL
Do you hear that you hideous thing

Glancing around Nathaniel surreptitiously YANKS on the slip knot
that keeps the troll hog tied

NATHANIEL (contd)
She’s waiting for you Lovely and soft
Yours for the taking

As the bindings COLLAPSE around him the troll stares cluelessly

NATHANIEL (cont‘d)
Well
(off the troll’s indifferent BELCH)
Go get her

TROLL
(sniffing at the air)
Girl smell pretty

Finally getting it the troll stands and the ropes fall off
Nathaniel watches him run away filled with anxious anticipation

EXT THE FOREST -—- MOMENTS LATER 11

Still singing Giselle runs through the woods Pip and the animals
in tow as she leaps with a natural agility onto a tall tree

EXT THE FOREST — CONTINUOUS 12

The prince rides quickly through the woods We HEAR a LOUD
THUMPING in time to Giselle’s song The STOMPING of large feet

As the troll suddenly overtakes the prince still singing

TROLL
Twooooluvvvvv’skissss

Edward looks up to see the troll’s large ASS overhead the
oblivious troll straddling him with his legs as he passes

EXT THE TOP OF THE TREE — CONTINUOUS 13

Still humming her song Pip and Giselle climb higher and higher
the ground receding below as she stretches to glimpse the Prince

PIP
Can you see him yet

GISELLE

I’m trying Maybe if I just climb a little

higher
Pip watches concerned as she climbs higher unaware that below
EXT THE BOTTOM OF THE TREE - CONTINUOUS 14
The troll eyes Giselle hungrily as he SCRAMBLES up towards her
EXT THE FOREST - CONTINUOUS 15
Edward rides to the rescue leaping over STREAMS and RAVINES

EXT THE TREE - CONTINUOUS 16

Suddenly hearing an unsettling SNORTING sound behind her Giselle
turns back shocked to see the troll reaching out for her feet

DOWN BELOW a galloping Prince Edward swiftly draws his sword

Giselle SQUEAKS with alarm as Pip fearlessly LEAPS onto the troll
futilely pounding his tiny fists against the troll’s thick head

PIP
You are messing with the wrong chipmunk
chump Back off before I hurt you
As the troll gets closer Giselle scrambles up even higher

Just as the evil troll stretches out a MASSIVE HAND to grab her
A spinning princely sword LANDS with a THWACK in a tree branch
PINNING the troll’s SLEEVE preventing him from reaching Giselle

The sword also CRACKS the limb that Giselle is standing on and she
SLIPS backwards barely CATCHING onto another branch

Where she finds herself face-to-face with the angry snorting
troll Horrified Giselle starts to LOSE HER HOLD on the branch

FIVE fingers FOUR fingers THREE fingers TWO

GISELLE
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhht

Giselle PLUMMETS past the troll We FOLLOW her as she FALLS
uncontrollably FAST through the branches towards earth Giselle
GASPS in terror convinced of her doom when suddenly

She LANDS in the ARMS OF THE PRINCE

GISELLE (cont’d)
Oh my gosh

Catching her breath Giselle looks in his eyes and he in hers
There’s an instant electric connection between them

GISELLE (contd)
It’s you

PRINCE EDWARD
I certainly hope so

The moment is interrupted by leaves falling on them Giselle and
Edward follow the source of the leaves up to see

The troll BENDING down into frame Still holding onto the top
branch his weight has BENT the entire tree downward Pip is
still perched on top of his head as the troll leers at Giselle

TROLL
Girl yummy

Giselle and Edward recoil as Pip nimbly HOPS off of the troll
The troll’s eyes go wide as he slowly realizes it was Pip’s tiny
bit of weight helping to hold him down Before he can react

BOINNNGGG

The tree BENDS violently back sending the howling troll FLYING
like a catapult into the next kingdom

SONG 1 — REPRISEDUET 17

Giselle swoons as Edward smiles his feelings coming out in song
How after a life time of searching he’s finally found his love
How he can’t wait for the two of them to be married with a grand
wedding at the castle and to have their love forever sealed by the
ultimate act and symbol of devotion

Their faces inches away as Edward sings “TRUE LOVES KISS

Giselle closes her eyes and puckers her lips the Prince moving
his face even closer to hers as suddenly

Prince Edward PULLS BACK startled by a troubling realization

GISELLE
What What is it darling

PRINCE EDWARD
You never told me your name

GISELLE
Giselle

PRINCE EDWARD
Giselle

They both smile as their faces come together to sing in harmony
about finding each other finding lovea sudden chaste shyness
coming over them both as they sing the words but refrain from the
actual deed TRUE LOVES KISS

This romantic tableau starts to SHIMMER as we REVEAL we’re
watching it from inside

INT THE QUEEN’S SORCERY ROOM —- CONTINUOUS 18

Where beautiful QUEEN NARISSA stands arms raised high ina
sorceresss pose angrily conjuring the romantic tableau of Prince
Edward and Giselle together in her MAGIC FOUNTAIN a “crystal
ball” that allows her to ‘see’ beyond the castle walls

SONG 1 -

Queen Narissa in a disturbing ending sings one sinister dark
line or couplet to this otherwise happy song vowing that their
happy ending their TRUE LOVES KISS will never come to pass

Incensed by what she sees Narissa SPLASHES the water the happy
image of Edward and Giselle DISAPPEARING in the angry ripples
Narissa lets out a furious blood curdling SCREAM

19 INT THE QUEEN’S THRONE ROOM - A LITTLE LATER 19

Cape flying an angry Narissa storms down a curving stairway past a
cowering Nathaniel who stares clearly in awe of her icy beauty

QUEEN NARISSA
This is all your fault

NATHANIEL
Yes Forgive me my queen My empress My
beautiful goddess

QUEEN NARISSA
Oh stop would you You disgust me

NATHANIEL
I disgust myself But I can’t help it You
know I only want what’s best for you for
(hesitantly reaching)
uUS

QUEEN NARISSA
(coyly hiding her contempt)
Us

NATHANIEL
(nervously stammering)
I was just wondering for a fleeting moment if
maybe there wasn’t a good side to all this
Fate pointing us in a new direction

QUEEN NARISSA
My stepson will be king The only
direction I‘ll be headed is out the door

NATHANIEL
But we’‘ll have more time together
Wouldn’t that be grand After all there’s
not much to being Queen Mother

Narissa’s eyes light with fury fuming at the mere mention

QUEEN NARISSA
Don’t say that Don’t ever say that
(almost nauseous)
Yeech Even the sound of it sickens me

Nathaniel steps forward eager to correct himself

NATHANIEL
Im sorry That was wrong Terribly
wrong Of course you’ll always be queen

-e-in the process stepping on Narissa’s long cape

NATHANIEL (contd)
No matter how smitten your stepson is

QUEEN NARISSA
Then he needs to be un-smitten

Narissa angrily storms away the stuck cape starting to FALL

QUEEN NARISSA (contd)
Her little backwoods backside will never
touch my throne I promise you

Suddenly leaving her naked back EXPOSED Her eyes widen at the
sudden chill Nathaniel’s eyes go even wider hungrily eying her

As she suddenly SPINS around catching him mid-peek Nathaniel
shoots his fingers up as if averting his gaze but it’s too late

She stares a hole in him as his fingers fall utterly busted

NATHANIEL
Your majestyI

QUEEN NARISSA
(a lethally sensuous stare)
That’s quite alright Nathaniel

Grabbing her cape he hurries to return it to her shoulders She
purrs with a feigned helplessness that belies her sickened sneer

QUEEN NARISSA (contd)
I can count on you can’t I

NATHANIEL
(staring achingly at her nearness)
Whatever you require No matter how evil
how wicked how deliciously despicable

Her repulsion becomes a coy smile as she turns to him Placing
her slender fingers on his cheek Nathaniel positively swoons

QUEEN NARISSA
Sweet boy Perhaps I’m overreacting
(a wicked grin)
If they really want a nice wedding ball
maybe we should give it to them

Narissa’s words are cut short by the sudden arrival of the Prince

EDWARD
Mother I have the most amazing news

Narissa does an immediate 180 her visage now the picture of
maternal kindness as she gives Edward a motherly embrace

QUEEN NARISSA
Darling I’ve heard She’s lovely And
don’t worry Mummy will take care of
everything
(a wicked smile)
It’ll be a day she never forgets

EXT THE CASTLE —- MORNING 20

ROYAL FOOTMEN stand at the landing of the castles main marble
staircase Festive ballroom MUSIC plays as a dainty gold carriage
pulls up and Nathaniel opens the door

Giselle emerges looking radiant in a lavish WEDDING GOWN A
sparkling bell-shaped skirt tapers to her puffy white sleeves

NATHANIEL
Oh Miss You look ravishing

GISELLE
Why thank you

Giselle starts her ascent up the stairs Nathaniel behind her as
Pip jumps out calling to her

PIP
Honey wait up We ain’t done with ya yet

An endless stream of animal friends skunks bunnies and deer
emerge from the impossibly small carriage following Giselle up
the stairs as they put the finishing touches on her ensemble

Bunnies wrap a bow around her waist as bluebirds float a pretty
tiara into her hair The mice set her glass slippers to step in

As Nathaniel leads an excited Giselle into the castle he makes a
point of SLAMMING the door on PIP and the rest of the animals

PIP (cont‘d)
What do we look like garbage Now who’s
gonna be on the bride’s side

EXT THE CASTLE -— CONTINUOUS 21
A slighted Pip scurries to the top of the castle moving along the

roof of the castle looking down through the windows and atriums
below as Nathaniel escorts Giselle towards the royal ballroom

22 EXT THE CASTLE COURTYARD -— MOMENTS LATER 22

Nathaniel leads Giselle through the courtyard She’s suddenly
taken aback to see a toothless OLD HAG step in her path

OLD HAG
Hello my dear Quite the day for you

GISELLE
It is Thank you

OLD HAG
Old granny has a wedding gift for you
love Lookee yonder

The hag points to a glimmering golden WISHING WELL

GISELLE
(fascinated)
Oh my
OLD HAG

‘Tis a wishing well dear You’ve only to
make a wish and your heart’s desire will
come true

An excited Giselle turns hesitantly to Nathaniel

NATHANIEL
That would be fine But quickly

The hag leads Giselle into the magical light of the well

OLD HAG
Just look into the well close your eyes
and make your wish
(as Giselle peers down into the deep dark well)
That’s right Lean in closer Are you
wishing for something

GISELLE
Yes I am
(closing her eyes as she smiles and whispers)
And they both lived happily ever af

Before Giselle can finish her wish the hag PUSHES HER IN
Giselle FALLS SCREAMING until her voice FADES AWAY

But we never HEAR her land

EXT A TREE OVERLOOKING THE COURTYARD — CONTINUOUS 23

Having witnessed this terrible treachery Pip’s eyes go wide in
shock Frightened he’ll be discovered he runs into the forest

EXT THE COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS 24

Turning away the Old Hag laughs wickedly Her face suddenly
MELTS and SHIFTS as she TRANSFORMS back into Queen Narissa
Nathaniel emerges from the shadows peering down into the well

NATHANIEL
Where did you send her my queen

QUEEN NARISSA
Ive sent her far far away
(smiling at her own wickedness)
To a place where there are no “happily ever
afters”

Nathaniel SHUDDERS as Narissa laughs a gleeful diabolical CACKLE
INT A VORTEX - CONTINUOUS 25

The queen’s evil laugh ECHOES with a nightmarish reverberance

As Giselle helplessly TWIRLS and TUMBLES through a swirling VORTEX
of shimmering cosmic energy A blizzard of twinkling magical
DUST attaches to her skin as she falls

Running her hands over her arms as she falls Giselle is startled
to see a strange TRANSFORMATION taking place the sparkling dust
changing her from an animated girl into a REAL WOMAN

Looking up Giselle glimpses the dust converging to form a DANCING
COUPLE gliding and spinning like a vision from a wonderful dream

Just as her metamorphosis is complete Giselle’s journey comes to
an abrupt end as she suddenly lands with a none too gentle

INT A VERY DARK SPACE - LIVE ACTION - CONTINUOUS 26
THUMP

She takes a deep frightened breath All is quiet save for the
distant echo of dripping water

Slowly lifting her head from her hands Giselle looks around for
some sense of where she could possibly be All she sees next to
her are FIVE SMALL HOLES

Out of which shoot five dusty SHAFTS OF LIGHT Confused Giselle
studies this strange sight

GISELLE
Oh my

Anxious to escape this dark scary place Giselle slowly crawls
over and peers through one of the holes

EXT A CITY STREET NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 27

A REVERSE CLOSE-UP on Giselle’s EYE BLINKING UP at us through the
hole

SLOWLY PULLING BACK Giselle curiously pokes her fingers out of
the other four holes as we start to realize

She’s looking UP AT US through a MANHOLE COVER We continue
PULLING BACK Giselle emitting a dainty GRUNT of exertion

As she manages to PUSH the cover up and SLIDE it to the side

Giselle slowly tentatively raises her head from the darkness
filled with a nervous apprehension

Giselle lets out a GASP of absolute and utter amazement as she
cranes her head in a slow twirling circle to see

A dramatic forced perspective of TIMES SQUARE in the very heart of
NEW YORK CITY An overwhelming vista of skyscrapers giant TVs
theme stores theatres and throngs of strangely dressed people
Her ears are assaulted by a deafening cacophony of honking
traffic yelling pedestrians and thumping music

Her eyes wide as saucers Giselle’s at a mind-numbing loss She
has no frame of reference for this place

GISELLE
Oh my goodness

Slowly hesitantly Giselle lifts herself out of the manhole
cover Her progress is almost immediately impeded by her wide
hoop skirt WEDGING in the hole Giselle pushes harder the skirt
SQUEEZING out like a mushroom cloud until it SNAPS back into its
original shape

No sooner does Giselle slowly rise to her feet when
HHHHHHOOOQOOOQOOQOQOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNKKKKKKEEREKRK ES

She’s startled by a chorus of CAR HORNS as four separate vehicles
SCREECH on their brakes to avoid hitting her

Their efforts resulting in a deafening CRASH

A shocked Giselle looking around to see she’s standing in the
center of the four wedged vehicles amazingly untouched

As the DRIVERS exit their cars in a flurry of muffled obscenities
a frightened GISELLE throws her arms up in alarm daintily picking
up her skirt

And SCURRYING away from the crash site onto the crowded sidewalk
EXT THE SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS 28

Falling into the throngs of hurrying PEDESTRIANS a confused
Giselle suddenly finds herself twisted around in the flow of
strangely dressed people Quickly stumbling backwards Giselle
shouts out to them a panicked inquiry

GISELLE
Hello Excuse me Pardon me I wonder if
one of you kind people might direct me to
the castle

As the jaded New Yorkers march indifferently around her Giselle
tries to explain further

GISELLE (cont’d)
I’m supposed to be at the ball to wed my
one true love Prince Edward
(off their non-response)
Please If you could just point me towards
the castle

Giselle doesn’t notice as she BUMPS into someone

MAN (0S)
Hey Watch it

Looking down Giselle notices next to her way down
A VERY SHORT MAN IN A BUSINESS SUIT

The man scowls up at Giselle his angry expression triggering a
hint of recognition in Giselle Could it possibly be

GISELLE
Grumpy

The little man’s scowl turns to fury as he pushes past Giselle
Startled Giselle steps backwards directly into

A human wall of oncoming FOOT TRAFFIC Before she can get her
bearings Giselle is PRESSED by the crowd of determined commuters

DOWN THE SUBWAY STAIRWAY
Disappearing from view as she calls out in a small anxious voice

GISELLE (cont’d)
Edward

EXT ANOTHER SUBWAY ENTRANCE - LATER 29

Located in a desolate seedy part of town Black storm clouds
loom over the dark skyline

We see a hesitant head pop up out of the subway entrance as a
frazzled and tousled Giselle slowly emerges from the subway Her
initially hopeful expression turns to disappointment as she
realizes she’s still nowhere near the castle

EXT A NEW YORK STREET - A FEW MOMENTS LATER 30

Giselle wanders down this dirty street of strewn garbage money
exchanges and pawn shops Her stacked-up hair is developing a
Pisa-like lean and her white dress is looking increasingly dirty

More discouraged then ever Giselle walks past PROFESSIONAL LADIES
working the street in short skirts and halter tops Her attempts
at a friendly smile are met with icy competitive glares

Until finally Giselle arrives at a derelict OLD MAN slumped over
on a stoop Weary and discouraged she offers a pleading smile

GISELLE
Hello old man May I sit with you

The old man stares Giselle taking this as invitation to sit down
for a much needed rest She lets out a long SIGH

GISELLE (cont’d)

(a wistful lament)
Im so tired and scared and hungry
I’ve never been this far from home and I’m
not at all sure where Im at

(turning to the old man)
If someone were to show me just a small bit
of kindness a friendly hello or even a
smile I think that would lift my spirits
so much

The old man suddenly opens his mouth in a wide decayed and near
toothless grin Giselle politely tries to hide her revulsion

GISELLE (cont’d)
(a forced smile)
Mywhat a lovely smile you have

Still smiling the old man reaches out and GRABS the diamond tiara
from her hair Giselle gives a shocked INHALE as he RUNS AWAY

GISELLE (cont’d)
Oh my gosh

As her pile-up hair COLLAPSES like a condemned building Giselle
quickly stands and chases after him

GISELLE (cont’d)
Come back Please

But her long blinding hair almost causes her to trip as she comes
to a frustrated stop

GISELLE (cont’d)
(shouting after him)
You‘re not very kind you know that

As suddenly it begins to RAIN

Giselle STUMBLES down the street trying to avoid the down pour
and failing miserably

EXT A CHINA TOWN MARTIAL ARTS STUDIOS - LATER 31

The Youth Kung Fu Class lets out as ROBERT McKENZIE shields his 6
year-old daughter MORGAN from the rain with an umbrella

A handsome man in his late 20searly 30s Robert’s thoughtful
expression matches his serious business suit though a softer side
of him reveals itself when he smiles down at Morgan

Dressed in a little martial arts uniform Morgan’s bright pretty
and growing up faster then perhaps even she would like

Hailing a passing cab Robert quickly opens the door for Morgan
INT THE TAXI - CONTINUOUS 32
They both buckle up as Robert closes the taxi door
ROBERT
(to the driver)

26 West 77th Street please

The cab takes off and Robert excitedly hands a gift wrapped
package to Morgan

MORGAN
(eyeing it suspiciously)
What‘s this

ROBERT
Just a present

MORGAN
What for

ROBERT
No reason

Morgan looks suspiciously at the present and back up at her dad

MORGAN
What’s the news

ROBERT
News

MORGAN
Whenever you have something to tell me you
always get me a present

ROBERT
(dismissively)
Oh that’s not true

MORGAN
(a quiet litany)
When the divorce went through you bought me
an iguana When I had to change schools
you got me an iPod

ROBERT
(eager to segue)
Why don’t you just open it

Morgan TEARS at the store-wrapped gift to reveal a very somber
looking BOOK She tries to conceal her clear disappointment

MORGAN
What is it

ROBERT
(enthused)
It’s the Famous Women Biography series
All about smart pioneering women who’ve
made important contributions in the 20th
Century

Morgan manages a look of gratitude at this achingly boring gift

MORGAN
Great

ROBERT
See this pull-out sheet here
(pointing in the book)

You can fill in your own time line to test
your knowledge of how much you retained

from your reading

MORGAN
Thank you

ROBERT

I thought it’d be interesting Real
stories about real people Exciting

MORGAN
(looking up unconvinced)
So there’s no news

Robert looks at her a guilty expression as he quietly admits

ROBERT
Wellthere is a little news

EXT A NEW YORK STREET - CONTINUOUS

As the taxi turns a corner the rain still coming down hard
HEAR the sound of Robert’s Blackberry RINGING

INT THE TAXI - CONTINUOUS
Robert looks down at the Blackberry message

ROBERT
It’s Nancy I’‘11 call her back

MORGAN

CLICKING it off

(looking up suddenly realizing)
Youre going to ask her to marry you

aren’t you

Robert shrugs self-consciously taken aback by her insight

ROBERT
Wellyeah

MORGAN
I knew it

ROBERT

Well we’ve dated for two years She and I
have talked about it This would be a good
time She’ll be through with Fashion Week

Youll be out of school
(MORE)

ROBERT (contd)
I think it’ll be great for all of us
(wondering what Morgan’s thinking)
You like her right

MORGAN
(noncommittal)
She’s good

ROBERT
She is isn’t she She’s a lot of fun
(off Morgan’s serious expression)
Look I don’t want you to worry It’s not
like she’s going to try and be your mother

MORGAN
I know Stepmother

ROBERT
A nice stepmother She even wants to take
you to school tomorrow Have you guys
share some “grown-up girl” bonding time

MORGAN
I’m only six

ROBERT
(a thoughtful smile)
We all grow up sometime sweetie
EXT ANOTHER NEW YORK STREET - A LITTLE LATER 35
The rain’s still pouring as Giselle staggers along Hungry
distraught and soaked to the skin she’s in a near delirious state
of exhaustion

Just as she’s about to collapse where she stands Giselle looks up
and sees what in her fevered mind appears to be her salvation

A 3-D BILLBOARD OF A LARGE CASTLE

It is in fact the “DISNEYLAND CASTLE” a fairy tale banner
beckoning Giselle with the prescient slogan “COME HOME”

Giselle smiles at this beautiful mirage like a thirsty person
discovering an oasis in the desert She can almost hear a
heavenly choir singing an ethereal chorus of celebration

Quickening her step Giselle finds the renewed energy to almost
run as she hurries towards the billboard

Running to an adjacent tree Giselle starts climbing to reach the
billboard moving with the same agility we saw in Andalasia

WHILE DOWN THE STREET

A TAXI approaches Robert and Morgan are inside
INT THE TAXI - CONTINUOUS 36

Robert reads excerpts from Morgan’s new Famous Women Biography
Series Morgan tries not to roll her eyes at this serious tome

ROBERT
“So even though she died an excruciatingly
painful death of radiation poisoning Madam
Curie made great scientific strides that we
benefit from to this day”

Morgan looks up at him troubled

MORGAN
She died

ROBERT
Well yes But it was in the name of
science

Morgan nods politely thoroughly unconvinced As the taxi stops
at a light Morgan’s eyes drift out her window

ROBERT (cont’d)
(to the TAXI DRIVER)
We’‘re up here on the right

--where she sees a strange woman in a white dress climbing onto
the Disneyland Castle Billboard

MORGAN
Daddy
ROBERT
(taking out his wallet)
Huh
MORGAN

Why’s there a lady out there

ROBERT
(sorting through his bills)
Where
MORGAN

There’s a princess on the castle billboard

ROBERT
(shaking his head not looking up)
Honey

MORGAN
Yes

ROBERT
(firmly)
You know we‘ve talked about all this
There’s no such thing as princesses and
enchanted kingdoms and glass slippers that
don’t fit anyone okay That’s all just
made up stuff You understand that right

MORGAN
(solemnly)
Right
ROBERT
Good
MORGAN

But she’s still there

ROBERT
Where

Finally looking up himself Robert sees the crazy girl slipping
along the billboard only barely managing to maintain her balance

ROBERT (cont’d)
What in the

Morgan suddenly opens her door and runs out to see Giselle A
panicked Robert tosses the cash to the Taxi Driver and follows
taking Morgan’s hand as he quickly leads her across the street

EXT THE BILLBOARD - CONTINUOUS 37
Giselle teeters precariously as her princess slippers slide on the
wet metal of the narrow billboard catwalk Giselle pulls
violently on the castle’s door handles but they refuse to open
As Robert and Morgan appear beneath her under the billboard
ROBERT
(shouting up at Giselle)

Hey you Miss

MORGAN
Hey

A confused Giselle follows the voices in the rain down to the
pavement where she sees Robert and Morgan frantically waving

GISELLE
(a weak smile)
Oh Hello

Giselle’s foot slides again and she tumbles back her body caught
in that terrible tipping point between recovery and disaster

ROBERT
Uh-oh

MORGAN
Daddy

Giselle FALLS OFF THE CATWALK barely managing to GRAB the edge of
the ‘doorknob’ with one hand Robert and Morgan watch
breathlessly as a dangling Giselle slowly starts to lose her grip
FIVE fingers FOUR fingers THREE fingers TWO
GISELLE
(falling off)
MORGAN
Catch her Daddy
Caught completely off guard Robert RUNS forward

ROBERT
Oh no Wait

Quickly curling his arms in something approximating a ‘catching’
position

CRASH
She SLAMS into his arms with a velocity that’s unfortunately all
too consistent with the real world laws of physics Unprepared
Robert’s arms COLLAPSE in a distinctly un-prince-like manner
jamming his thumb as Giselle lands butt-first on the wet pavement
GISELLE
(groaning)
Owwwwwwitt

Robert hops in a pained circle holding onto his jammed thumb

ROBERT
Damnit That hurts

Morgan runs over to Giselle helping her up

MORGAN
Are you okay

GISELLE
Im fine

Robert still grimacing with intense pain from his thumb

ROBERT
Oh good I’m glad you’re okay

Rubbing her bruised backside Giselle smiles gratefully thrilled
that someone’s actually talking to her Robert notices her grin

ROBERT (contd)
Why are you smiling like that

GISELLE
You’re both so kind I’ve been wandering
so far and long today I’m afraid nobodys
been very nice

ROBERT
Yeah wellwelcome to New York
GISELLE
(thrilled to be welcomed)

Thank you
Robert looks at her suspiciously Morgan looks at her and smiles
38 INT ROBERT’S HALLWAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER 38

The elevator doors OPEN and everyone emerges into the hallway
Robert leads the way as Morgan glances back amazed by Giselle’s
ball dress A soaking wet Giselle trails behind thrilled to
share her grand adventure with a pair of “friendly ears”

GISELLE
--and then the old hag said I should look
in the well and wish for my heart’s desire
but I must have looked in so far that I
fell Down and down and down And then I
climbed out of the round hole and here I
am

Robert nods curiously trying to reconcile this strange tale
Meanwhile Morgan can’t take her eyes off Giselle

ROBERT (CONT’D)
Thats some story

GISELLE
(almost apologetic)
Its not a very nice one

MORGAN
I liked it

Giselle looks at Morgan and smiles

GISELLE

Im certain Edward’s already searching for
me No doubt by morning he’1ll come and
rescue me from this strange land and take
me home

(suddenly concerned)
If I could just find a place to rest my
head for the night

Robert’s defenses go up

ROBERT
What sort of place

GISELLE
Oh I don’t know Maybe a nearby meadow or
a hollow tree

ROBERT
A “hollow tree”

GISELLE
(smiling)
Or a house full of dwarfs

MORGAN
(helpfully)
I bet they’d let you sleep with them

Robert tries to ignore Morgan’s comment eying Giselle warily

ROBERT
All I can really do is let you in for a few
minutes if you want to dry off use the
phone
(putting the key in the lock)
We have our own bedtime to stick to

Robert looks back at her incredulously as he opens the door
leading Morgan inside Giselle follows behind when suddenly

INT ROBERT’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 39

ZZZZZTTTTIL¢

--she GRINDS to a halt her giant hoop skirt WEDGED in the door
Giselle pushes hard against it to try and SQUISH her way through

ROBERT
(surveying her ‘situation’ )
What’s with the dress

GISELLE
(proudly explaining as she THRUSTS forward)
I gathered all the berries for the dye out
in the meadow and I crushed them with a
mortar and I made the sparkles out of tiny
bits of polished rocks

Morgan helps out grabbing Giselle’s hands and PULLING

MORGAN
You made it all by yourself

Robert grabs her hands as well helping PULL as

GISELLE
Wellnot all of it The mice and rabbits
did help with the sewing

MORGAN
They’re good

--Giselle finally POPS THROUGH Robert CLOSES the door and
Giselle steps forward suddenly LUNGING BACK as we see

GISELLE (CONT’D)
Oh my

Her ridiculously long hair is TRAPPED in the front door She TUGS
like a trapped animal trying to chew off its own leg until

Robert OPENS the door and Giselle ROLLS backward into their
apartment a sweet smile as she daintily pulls her wet skirt down
from over her head Robert checks his watch troubled

ROBERT
So did you want to give someone a call

GISELLE
(smiling at this absurdity)
I doubt anyone would hear me from here

ROBERT
(pulling his phone book out of the end table)
Why don’t we see about getting you a car

Standing Giselle warms herself as she wanders to the couch

MORGAN
Couldn’t she sleep here Daddy

-FLOPPING down into the cushions with her wet hair and dress

ROBERT
Um No That’s a big ‘no’

Giselle stretches like a cat yawning with utter exhaustion As
Robert searches for the number Morgan leans in and whispers

MORGAN
Are you really a princess

GISELLE
(softly)
Not yetalmost

Giselle lays her head down on the edge of the couch In the very
next moment she’s sound asleep breathing deeply

MORGAN
(amazed)
Wow She is out

Robert glances up from the yellow pages aghast

ROBERT
Oh no This is not acceptable

Morgan looks up with pleading eyes

MORGAN
You’re not really gonna make her go are
you Daddy

ROBERT
(turning to Morgan)
Go to bed you

MORGAN
(studying Giselle as she sleeps)
I think she might be a real princess

ROBERT
Okay Morgan Remember our talk

MORGAN
But Daddy

ROBERT
A big funny dress does not make her a
princess

(MORE)

ROBERT (contd)
She’s obviously running away from some
bizarre traumatizing wedding fiasco
including all these strange claims of
royalty And real or not all that makes
her is a seriously confused woman who’s
somehow been dumped in our laps She needs
our sympathy more than our fascination

MORGAN
So are we gonna be sympathetic and let her
stay
ROBERT
(a little annoyed)
Bedtime

Morgan gives Robert a hug as he watches her paddle back to her
room The moment her door CLOSES Robert dials the phone

DISPATCHER (0S)
Mid-town Car

ROBERT (CONTD)
(into the phone)
Hi I need a car at 26 West 77th Street

DISPATCHER (0S)
Can you hold please

Sighing Robert’s gaze turns to his front window the heavy rain
PELTING unrelentingly against the glass He tries to resist an
overwhelming feeling of ‘sympathy’

As his eyes turn back to Giselle sleeping

With her lovely face and perfect skin bathed in the gentle glow of
the dimmed track lighting she’s absolutely beautiful

And though he’d never admit it to himself let alone out loud
She does look like a princess

Robert waits on the phone Despite his better judgement he just
can’t bring himself to send her back out into the night

DISPATCHER (0S) (cont‘d)
Hello sir Destination please

But Robert doesn’t answer his eyes still on Giselle as he quietly
clicks off the phone

INT MORGAN’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 40

Robert peeps in her door whispering in a clandestine hush

ROBERT
Morgan
MORGAN
(sleepily in her bed)
Huh
ROBERT

Lock your door

MORGAN
why

ROBERT

(a loud whisper)
Just do it

DISSOLVE TO
EXT TIMES SQUARE - MORNING 41

We‘re back at the same manhole where Giselle emerged a trio of
SEWER WORKERS replacing the cover We HEAR a sudden HISSING as

SWOOSH

Prince Edward SHOOTS out of the hole the force of gravity landing
him on the street in a dashing swashbuckling pose

ZZZZZZZZZ22Z22TTT 2

Before the workers can even figure out where he came from Edward’s
sword is already pressed against the terrified SUPERVISOR‘S neck

PRINCE EDWARD
(a quiet urgency)
Who are you Are you in league with the
wicked old hag who sent my poor Giselle to
this foul place

SWOOSH

Pip suddenly FLIES out of the manhole and Edward PLUCKS him in mid-
air like he’s stopping a fast ball turning to him

PRINCE EDWARD (contd)
Is this man party to this evil plot
chipmunk

Pip tries to answer when he suddenly discovers an unpleasant
reality about this world

E CAN’‘T SPEAK HERE Instead he’s reduced to clutching at his
throat gasping and chirping incapable of forming a single word

PRINCE EDWARD (cont’d)
(an understanding smile)
Poor chipmunk Speechless in my presence
(turning intensely back to the Supervisor)
What say you sir Don’t try my patience

SUPERVISOR
(frightened gasping)
I don’t even know who you’re looking for

PRINCE EDWARD
(his voice suddenly softening)
I search for a beautiful young woman her
hair like spun gold her skin like
alabaster Pleasing of form and lovely of
spirit I long to find her more then life
itself

SUPERVISOR
(his eye still on Edward’s sword)
I’d like to find one of those too

PRINCE EDWARD
(a royal command)
Then keep a wary eye out peasant
Turning towards the street Prince Edward energetically LEAPS onto
a TAXI Pip joining him as they stomp across the stalled cars like
stepping stones oblivious to the angry pissed-off DRIVERS
INT ROBERT’S LIVING ROOM - MORNING 42

Giselle wakes with a demure sleepy stretch on the couch Slowly
batting her eyes awake she looks around the room to realize

The home of her newfound friends is an untidy mess (the sloth of a
busy single parent) Dirty clothes are strewn about magazines
litter the floor and the sink is full of dirty dishes

Slowly standing Giselle puts her hands to her waist as she gives
a disapproving “Tsk Tsk”

GISELLE
This just won’t do

EXT ROBERT’S WINDOW - A MOMENT LATER 43

Craning out the window Giselle sings out in a clear voice

GISELLE
Ha-ha-ha-haaaaaaa

EXT VARIOUS SHOTS AT STREET LEVEL - CONTINUOUS 44

Giselle’s pretty voice echoes downward as the animals of the city
hear her siren call

This being New York however cuddly bunnies and cute fawns are in
short supply Instead the city’s natural inhabitants respond
RATS emerge up the subway stairs PIGEONS take leave of the statue
they’re defecating on all hurrying towards Roberts apartment

INT ROBERT’S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 45

The vermin stream en masse into the apartment via the WINDOW and
HEATING VENTS COCKROACHES scurry out of the SINK Giselle’s eyes
go wide as she takes in these “alternate species” of ‘friends’
but appreciating their help she manages a grateful smile

GISELLE
Well it’s always nice to make new friends
(clapping her hands together CLAP CLAP CLAP)
Alright everyone Let’s tidy things up

INT ROBERT’S LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER 46

An upbeat “Whistle While You Work” sort of tune plays Giselle
singing and supervising as the rats lick the dirty dishes clean
the cockroaches take out the trash bags en masse and the pigeons
flap their wings to ‘herd’ the “dust bunnies” out the window
INT ROBERT’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 47

Asleep in bed Robert has a half smile on his face as he dreams
that he hears a lovely young woman SINGING

Opening his eyes he remembers he’s not dreaming Sitting up
Robert springs out of bed

INT THE HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER 48

The ‘pretty’ singing continues as Robert emerges from his bedroom
pulling on his robe as he walks down the hallway Morgan comes
out of her room a moment later

INT ROBERT’S LIVING ROOM —- CONTINUOUS 49

Robert’s eyes go wide in shock as he steps from the hallway to
see

Their entire apartment is filled with VERMIN Pink tailed sewer
rats armies of cockroaches flea-ridden pigeons Before he even
notices they’re all engaged in ‘chores’

A horrified disgusted Robert charges into the room SWATTING and
SWEARING at these invading hordes

ROBERT
What in the Get the hell out of here

As Morgan walks out a moment later she SCREAMS in terror
INT ROBERT’S FRONT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 50
As Robert SWEEPS the vermin towards the front door he yells

ROBERT
Morgan quick Open it

A creeped-out Morgan swings the door open as Robert sends them all
fleeing As Morgan SLAMS the door shut they HEAR the sound of
happy SINGING and running water coming from the bathroom
ROBERT (cont’d)
(to Morgan eyeing the bathroom)
Wait here
Robert hesitantly follows the singing to the open bathroom door
INT THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 51

Robert cautiously peers in the open door just as Giselle steps out
of the shower his eyes wide as he realizes she’s completely

SWOOOSH

A pair of PIGEONS grab a towel and quickly wrap it around Giselle

ROBERT
(quickly shielding his gaze)
Oh my Excuse me I
GISELLE

(smiling unaffected)
Good morning Robert Did you have nice
dreams

ROBERT
No

INT THE FRONT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

GISELLE
(shaking out her massive mane like a dog)
This room is magic Where does the water
come from

ROBERT
Umfrom the pipes

GISELLE
(looking up through her parted hair)
Where do the pipes get it

ROBERT
I don’t know Fromwherever the pipes
get it

GISELLE
It is magic

The front door BUZZES and Morgan opens it to see Roberts

girlfriend NANCY DUBOIS

is sexy

smart and dressed even smarter She’s also busy

Blackberry glued to her ear as she smiles at Morgan

Nancy lets herself in

NANCY
Hey ‘girlfriend’
(into her Blackberry)
No May That isn’t gonna work

MORGAN
(woodenly)
Hi Ms Dubois

NANCY
(cradling the Blackberry)
Honey how many times have I told you
Call me Nancy

MORGAN
Yes Ms Dubois

NANCY
Just find out what time they can meet
(covering the Blackberry to Morgan)
Listen I’m running a little late So

minute half-hour okay

almost immediately

An attractive professional woman Nancy

her

a suspicious expression as she notices

NANCY (cont‘d)
It’s so neat in here You guys get a maid

MORGAN
(hesitantly)
Umno Not exactly
Hearing voices in the rest of the apartment Nancy keeps walking

INT THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 53

A smiling Giselle OPENS the bathroom door squeezing past Robert
as he squeezes in checking to make sure nothing’s flooded

As one last Pigeon FLIES up at him like a flushed grouse

ROBERT
Aaaaaaaahhhhh

A startled Robert falls BACKWARDS right on top of Giselle the two
of them falling limbs akimbo right out into

INT THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 54
Robert falling first and Giselle a moment later right on top of
him her towel only barely on at this point They stare at each

other a moment both gulping hard at this unsettling intimacy

NANCY (0S)
What the hell is going on here

They both look up to see Nancy standing over them Robert LEAPS
from the floor thrusting Giselle into a standing position

ROBERT
(stunned)
Nancy
NANCY

Who is this

GISELLE
(smiling sweetly as she adjusts her towel)
Hello I’m Giselle I was on my way to
the castle to get married and

NANCY
(turning to Robert)
She’s married

ROBERT
No She’s not Not yet

NANCY
(to Robert incensed)
What do you mean ‘yet’

ROBERT
Nancy She was lost I was helping her

NANCY
With what Finding the shower

GISELLE
(smiling)
That shower is wonderful You should try
it Nancy

NANCY
Oh I’m sure it is

ROBERT
Nancy calm down Let’s talk at least

But Nancy is beside herself her sense of betrayal pouring out

NANCY
About what Robert How I never took a
shower here How you never had me over
because Morgan was here “I have
les” you said “I have to move
slowly” I thought “I’m so lucky Hes
sensitive”
(eyeing Giselle)
I didn’t realize you were worried about
crowd control

ROBERT
(quietly)
We could talk later

NANCY
(turning to go)
Don’t bet on it

ROBERT
But what about taking Morgan to school
Grown-up girl bonding time

NANCY
(looking at Giselle)
So you can have some grown-up girl bonding
time I don’t think so

As her anger reaches its zenith fever pitch Nancy’s Blackberry
RINGS Angrily turning it off she storms out in a furious huff
hurrying past Morgan Robert runs after Nancy out the door

EXT ROBERT’‘S APARTMENT BUILDING - A MOMENT LATER 55
Robert runs onto the sidewalk

ROBERT
Nancy wait

Just as Nancy slams the door on the cab and it pulls away A
deflated Robert watches her go before storming back inside

INT ROBERT’S APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER 56

An extremely irate Robert is KNOCKING impatiently on his own
bedroom door as Giselle brightly answers

GISELLE (0S)
Hello

ROBERT
Okay you know what You gotta go Now
I don’t know what your deal is If you’re
waiting on Prince Charming or

GISELLE (0S)
Prince Edward

ROBERT
Whatever I can’t have you here alright
(softening despite himself)
So I’‘ll get you to the bus depot train
station airport wherever and then that
is it I can’t get involved after that

As Giselle emerges from the bedroom wearing a blindingly bright
aqua-green PEASANT FROCK

ROBERT (cont’d)
Where’d you get that

GISELLE
I made it
(smiling)
Do you like it

Robert’s eyes go to the CURTAINS in his living room still hanging
even though the various sections of a DRESS PATTERN have been
neatly cut out of them He shakes his head incredulous

GISELLE (cont’d)
(off his reaction)
You’‘re unhappy

ROBERT
You made a dress out of my curtains

GISELLE
You are unhappy

Robert looks at her His short fuse is down to a mere nub

ROBERT
I‘m not ‘unhappy’ I’m angry

GISELLE
Angry

ROBERT
Yeah It’s an unpleasant emotion You‘’ve
heard of it

GISELLE
Ive heard of it but

ROBERT
(letting her have it)
Look you have created a completely
unnecessary problem with Nancy that I now
have to resolve The fact is I was just
getting ready to take a very serious step
forward with her A proposal actually

At the mention of a ‘proposal’ Giselle gives an excited INHALE
ROBERT (cont’d)

»-but now she has it in her mind that you
and I well

GISELLE
(horrified)
Kissed
ROBERT

Something like that

GISELLE
(suddenly inspired)
Why don’t you sing to her Maybe that
would reassure her of your affections

ROBERT
‘Sing’ to her

GISELLE

(effusively)
You could rush to her side and take her in
your arms Pour your heart out ina
beautiful ballad Then shell know for

(feeling his stare)
Why are you looking at me

ROBERT

I dont know Its like you escaped from a
Hallmark card or something

Little Mermaid backpack

He runs into his room to get dressed Morgan whispers to Giselle

MORGAN

Don‘t worry Daddy’s a little cranky but
he’s smart I’m sure he’ll help you get
back to your Prince

Giselle smiles

giving Morgan a warm hug she’s happy to return

EXT TIMES SQUARE - LATER 57

Just as the crew sets the manhole cover back they HEAR a loud

BONK The sound of flesh against cast iron as a man SCREAMS

Startled the workers reticently lift the cover to see a man
dressed like a Renaissance Fair escapee Nathaniel

SUPERVISOR

(peeking into the hole)
You looking for a beautiful girl too

-e-as he climbs

out of the hole fussily dusting off his garments

NATHANIEL

Im looking for a prince

SUPERVISOR
(curiously looking over Nathaniel)
Right

You’‘ve met your match foul bellowing
beast

They turn towards the sound of Edward’s booming voice
EXT THE BUS - CONTINUOUS 58

Approaching POLICE SIRENS wail as Edward violently PLUNGES his
sword into the roof of a crosstown BUS

INT THE BUS -— CONTINUOUS 59

Edwards BLADE juts through barely missing the panicked
COMMUTERS The blade starts to pull back PEELING open the top of
the bus until it SKEWERS an OLD LADY’s bag of birdfeed Tearing
back the sheet metal Edward and Pip peek inside looking around

Seeing no sign of Giselle Edward instead boldly proclaims

PRINCE EDWARD
The beast is dead I set you all free

EXT THE BUS - CONTINUOUS 60

Edwards startled to see Nathaniel has climbed up next to him He
smiles warmly at his trusted valet

PRINCE EDWARD
Loyal Nathaniel Always looking over my
shoulder aren’t you

DOWN THE STREET SQUAD CARS turn the corner and COPS start exiting
their cars Nathaniel senses trouble

NATHANIEL
(a devilish smile)
Oh if you only knew
(noticing the police exiting their vehicles)
Perhaps we should search elsewhere for your
lovely bride

PRINCE EDWARD
(considering it)
Perhaps

Withdrawing his sword an agreeable Edward JUMPS down with
Nathaniel from the bus Pip scurrying along with them

As the COPS shout for them to ‘STOP’ they break into a run The
three of them quickly disappear into the nearest alley

EXT TAYLOR WHITE and ASSOCIATES - A LITTLE LATER 61

Giselle at his side Robert runs up to the front doors but as
they AUTOMATICALLY OPEN Giselle steps back startled

As Robert turns back wondering what she’s waiting for Grabbing
her hand he quickly tugs her through the doors to the elevators

EXT TAYLOR WHITE and ASSOCIATES RECEPTION - MOMENTS LATER 62

Robert hurries into his office Giselle in tow His cherubic
secretary SANDY looks up as Robert approaches in a state of panic

ROBERT
Please don’t tell me Mrs Schumer’s already
here
SUSAN
Mrs Schumer’s already here
ROBERT
(nervously)
Oh no
SUSAN
Along with Mr Schumer and his lawyer
ROBERT
Oh no
(panicked)

How long have they been waiting

SUSAN
Do you really want to know

ROBERT
(anxiously)
No Listen I need you to deal with
something for me
(whispering towards Giselle)
This girl

Seeking to quench her thirst Giselle picks up a COFFEE MUG
glancing right past the alien looking Sparkletts dispenser

SUSAN
Who is she

ROBERT
I have no idea

Susan follows Robert’s stare to Giselle who’s smiling at a
different source of bubbly fresh spring water the OFFICE
AQUARIUM She happily SCOOPS her cup full and takes a yummy sip

ROBERT (cont‘d)
Im pretty sure she’s from out of town

SUSAN
Well what did you want me to

ROBERT
I don’t know Justfind out where she’s
from and get her there And make it cheap
Im probably going to end up paying for it
(suddenly remembering)
Oh and if Nancy calls let me know I have
to talk with her

Susan’s eyes go from Robert to Giselle and back again

SUSAN
I bet

ROBERT
(to Giselle)
‘Kay Giselle I have a critically
important meeting here Susan’s gonna help
you get home

GISELLE
(her mouth full)
Mmm-—hmmm
ROBERT

Just please try and keep things low key

Giselle nods agreeably waiting until Robert turns to politely
SPIT out a tropical fish she accidentally drank back into her cup

We slowly WIDEN to INCLUDE the aquarium just over her shoulder
Giselle completely unaware as next to her an eerie glowing WATER
IMAGE of Queen Narissa’s FACE suddenly forms inside the aquarium
glowering at her with absolute hatred

A REVERSE ANGLE

OVER Narissa’s shoulder as she looks at Giselle fish swimming
nervously past Narissa’s face as she TURNS BACK towards us

QUEEN NARISSA
(nodding towards Giselle)
Now you know where she is

We PULL OUT TO REVEAL we’re watching the Queen from inside
INT A BURGER KING REST ROOM - CONTINUOUS 63

-the clairvoyant waters of a men’s room TOILET The stall is
dark save for the sickly green light from the toilet reflecting on
Nathaniel’s face as he stares adoringly at his mistress

QUEEN NARISSA
(speaking up from the water)
I don’t want the prince coming anywhere
near her do you hear me

NATHANIEL
Don’t worry my queen He’s clueless He
doesn’t possess your amazing powers of
sorcery and clairvoyance Your
extraordinary gift for precognition

QUEEN NARISSA
Would you stop with the boot licking you
toady All I want to hear from your
snivelling lips is that dear sweet Giselle
is dead

On which note Nathaniel HEARS a churning GLUG GLUG GLUG
THREE putrid boil-covered red APPLES suddenly POPPING UP

NATHANIEL
(inspired despite his revulsion)
Poison apples How lusciously perverse

The pulsing noxious apples circle the queen’s smiling face her
voice low and evil and wicked

QUEEN NARISSA

It won’t be difficult Just one bite
That’s all it takes One small bite to
drag her down into a deep and troubled
sleep And when the hands of the clock
strike twelve the claws of death will
clutch at her heart

(a sadistic smile)
And that precious little pretender to my
throne will be gone

NATHANIEL
But your most serene highness How will a
wretched servant like me ever get her
to

Nathaniel squeamishly reaches in to grab the apples

QUEEN NARISSA
(dripping contempt)
Oh stop whining and figure it out you
dullard I just want it done

Fighting his gag reflex as he wipes them off Nathaniel laments
his plight as he gazes adoringly at Narissa’s lingering visage

NATHANIEL
My God why do you have to be so beautiful

Narissa’s face disappears leaving only the reflection in the
water of a shocked chipmunk eavesdropping from atop the stall

NATHANIEL (cont’d)
You

Nathaniel LEAPS at Pip who deftly JUMPS out of reach Nathaniel
chases after him

INT BURGER KING’S DINING AREA - CONTINUOUS 64

Sitting at a table Edward takes his first curious bite of a
french fry as the washroom door suddenly BURSTS open Pip pops
out and races to Edward A frantic Nathaniel follows a moment
later imploring the prince

NATHANIEL
Please don’t listen to this insane little
vermin He’s obviously ate some bad nuts
We should put him down for his own good

PRINCE EDWARD
Nathaniel please Let him talk

NATHANIEL
But sire

PRINCE EDWARD
(silencing him with his hand)
Go ahead Pip What is it you want to say

Reduced to ‘acting’ his message Pip points to Nathaniel doing a
perfect impression of him smiling and scheming with the apple

PRINCE EDWARD (cont’‘d)
Nathaniel’s glad to have me near

Pip shakes his head frustrated He “switches roles” to ‘Giselle’
choking dying a tragic death from the poison

PRINCE EDWARD (cont’d)
You feel you’d die without me here
(Pip vamps the prince ‘heroically’ rescuing Giselle)
You think me brave and cavalier

Pip fumes at the Prince’s complete misunderstanding clinching his
little fists The prince looks down at Pip gently chiding him

PRINCE EDWARD (cont’d)
All of that might be well and true Pip
But we really have more important things to
worry about right now

The prince walks away as a relieved Nathaniel smiles giving Pip a
condescending head pat Pip SCREECHES angrily

Another text message apology

MAY
How many does that make

NANCY
Im not sure exactly
(quietly trying to stay strong)
Im pretty sure not enough

MAY
So what are you saying You’re never going
to forgive him

Nancy picks up a blouse deftly inspecting the seams as she talks

NANCY
Im sure I willat some point I mean
it‘s not like I’m one of those women who
sit around their entire lives waiting for
some perfect Prince in shining armor to
take me off to his castle in the Hamptons
I got over that fantasy a long time ago

AT

Biting her lip Nancy suddenly RIPS the blouse in half a calming
breath as she apologetically hands it back to the poor SEAMSTRESS

NANCY (cont’d)
With Robert and I it’s real you know I
can count on him At least I thought I
could

MAY
(eyeing her knowingly)
You wanna know what I think

NANCY
Is that a multiple choice question

MAY
I think you’re a hopeless romantic who’s
discovered romance is hopeless

NANCY
(not wanting to engage this theory)
You can’t find anything else to do

INT TAYLOR WHITE and ASSOCIATES RECEPTION - LATER 66

Robert emerges from his office with KATHERINE SCHUMER her ex-to-
be quirkily handsome 40ish STEPHEN SCHUMER and his older attorney
HENRY Robert smiles pleased by the results of their meeting

ROBERT
Well I think this went well I always
say there’s no reason not to be
reasonable

HENRY
Great I think we might actually be in the
neighborhood of a settlement

Robert notices Susan frantically waving him over to her desk

ROBERT
One second folks
(leaning over to Susan)
What What is it

SUSAN
(nodding towards Giselle a nervous whisper)
She has no driver’s license No passport
I can’t even find this place she’s talking
about

ROBERT
What place

SUSAN
Andalasia I’ve called every travel agent
Every air line I don’t know if it’s a
country A city

ROBERT
(weakly)
«eea State

Robert and Susan look over to Giselle a dreamy smile on her face
as she dances in happy circles to the easy listening station

SUSAN
More like a state of mind
(leaning in under her breath)
She told me it’s just beyond the “Meadows
of Joy” and “The Valley of the Pixies”
(nervously eyeing Giselle)
I mean what’s that all about

Across the room Giselle’s twirls land her next to Mrs Schumer
She touches her short styled hair with unabashed admiration

GISELLE
Oh my goodness Your hair is lovely
You’re beautiful

KATHERINE
(taken aback flattered)
Oh Well thank you

GISELLE
The man who holds your heart is a lucky
fellow indeed

KATHERINE
(eyeing her ex-to-be)
Try telling him that
GISELLE
(brightly)
Oh I’m sure he already knows

Talking to Henry Stephen’s still close enough to OVERHEAR them

STEPHEN
Excuse me

Giselle breaks into a smile at ‘meeting’ Stephen

GISELLE
Oh are you him You must be so happy The
way her eyes sparkle No wonder you’re in
love

STEPHEN
(confused looking around the room)
Is this a joke

GISELLE
I would never joke about love You make
such a handsome couple

Giselle takes hold of each of their hands Stephen and Katherine
sharing an awkward glance before quickly pulling them away A
horrified Robert quickly moves between them to intervene

ROBERT
(a polite hiss)
Giselle Please

Stephen and Katherine watch in confusion as Robert explains

ROBERT (cont‘d)
It’s not like that alright
(quietly)
Theyre not together anymore

GISELLE
(mystified)
I don’t understand

ROBERT
They’re getting a divorce
(off Giselle’s confusion)
They’re separating from one another

GISELLE
(troubled)
Separating For how long

ROBERT
(quietly)
Forever

GISELLE
(aghast)
You mean forever and ever

Giselle’s lower lip starts to tremble as she contemplates the
awfulness of this notion Shameless tears start to roll

STEPHEN
(to Giselle incredulous)
Are you crying
(turning to Robert)
Is she actually ‘crying’

Giselle SINKS in a sad little heap and indeed starts to cry She
looks up at them apologetic

GISELLE
(sniffling)
Im sorry I can’t help it That’s so
sad

Despite her cool facade Katherine also starts to get upset doing
her damndest not to give Stephen the satisfaction of seeing it

KATHERINE
(to Robert angrily)
What kind of place are you running here
This is so unprofessional

Katherine turns towards the door before she loses it completely
ROBERT
(taking a step after her)
Katherine wait

Robert’s older boss CARL walks in totally unaware of this mess

CARL
Good morning Katherine How are you

»as Katherine hurries past him Henry angrily turns to Robert
and Carl as Stephen fights back his own emotions beside him

HENRY
If you guys are trying to manipulate us
you can throw this whole deal out

The two of them quickly walk out A very displeased Carl takes
Robert aside as Giselle waves goodbye to the Schumers

CARL
What was that all about Who’s she

ROBERT
She’s a friend An acquaintance I

CARL
You know Robert we pride ourselves on the
clients severing their personal bonds ina
calm polite manner And when I walk in
here and see people getting emotional

ROBERT
I‘m gonna fix this Carl I swear to you

Robert stares unnerved into Carl’s stern expression the
consequences of his failure etched in his boss’s unyielding gaze

INT TAYLOR WHITE and ASSOCIATES RECEPTION - MOMENTS LATER 67

Robert tugs Giselle by the arm out of the reception area towards
the elevators Just out of earshot he furiously lays into her

ROBERT
(pressing the elevator button)
What is wrong with you

GISELLE
Me

ROBERT
This whole Kumbaya Up With People Good
Morning Mary Sunshine Happy Talk routine
of yours Those people are in real pain
They have major issues And you come along
and talk to them like that

GISELLE
(still upset)
Well no wonder they’re in pain Separated
forever Married one day and the next day
they’re not What kind of awful place is
this

The elevator opens and Robert practically PULLS Giselle in
ROBERT
(pushing the down button)
It’s called ‘reality’

GISELLE
I think I’d rather be in Andalasia

ROBERT
I think I’d like that too

The elevator doors close on Robert’s extremely unhappy expression

EXT CENTRAL PARK - LATER 68

Three heads slowly rise over the wall surrounding the park
Edward Nathaniel and Pip all searching for some sign of Giselle
Spying Robert’s office Nathaniel whispers deviously to Edward

NATHANIEL
I wonder if we might cover more ground
separately Me by myself and you with
(a sneering nod to Pip)

As Nathaniel engages the prince Pip suddenly notices

PRINCE EDWARD
An excellent plan Nathaniel

-ACROSS THE STREET An upset Robert leads Giselle from his
office to the park Pip SQUEAKS loudly and Nathaniel notices too

PRINCE EDWARD (cont‘d)
Which way do you propose we

Nathaniel SNATCHES Pip up in his fist before he can alert the
prince quickly pointing over Edward’s shoulder at a passing GIRL

NATHANIEL
Look Do you see her Over there

PRINCE EDWARD
Giselle Where

NATHANIEL
(practically pushing the prince)
Hurry Run to her Not a moment to lose

The prince takes off in the opposite direction As Pip CHIRPS
muffled cries of protest Nathaniel ducks behind the wall

EXT CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS 69
As Robert angrily leads Giselle by the arm into the park
ROBERT
--l mean I tried to do the right thing
here To be nice
GISELLE
(as he pulls her along)

Youve been very nice

Nathaniel PEEKS through the bushes We stay on Robert and
Giselle

ROBERT
And I’ve been severely punished for it
Between jamming my thumb which really
hurts a house full of rats My girlfriend
thinkingwhatever And now I almost get
fired I just

His patience is exhausted as he suddenly reaches for his wallet

GISELLE
What

ROBERT
I can’t help you anymore Giselle
(handing her some money)
Justtake this Call up your prince
Have him pick you up bring his horse
whatever ‘cause I honestly don’t think I
can handle this

GISELLE
(feeling badly)
Robert
ROBERT

Just go Please
Robert takes a deep breath and starts to turn

GISELLE
I’m so sorry Robert

He turns back to her despite himself Giselle looks at him with
total contrition her voice soft her words simple and heartfelt

GISELLE (cont’d)
You‘ve been a kind friend to me when I had
none I‘d never want to make you unhappy
or cause you trouble So I’‘ll go now I
wish you every happiness

Giselle forces a brave smile as she turns away a swoosh of her
dress as she lightly steps into the park

Feeling terrible already a guilty Robert tries to walk back to
his office but stops looking over his shoulder

As Giselle saunters down the park path Robert stares curiously
as she stops to have a friendly talk with an old bag lady Almost
immediately Giselle starts to hand her money over to the woman

Robert rolls his eyes in frustration running out after her

BA

EXT THE BAG LADY’S BENCH - MOMENTS LATER 70

Robert hurries up to Giselle and the old bag lady surrounding by
a flock of hungry pigeons that she’s been feeding

ROBERT
Giselle what are you doing

Giselle turns to him thrilled that they’re ‘reunited’
GISELLE
Robert This is Emma She says she saw

Edward

Looking closer we realize she’s the same bag lady FROM THE BUS

EMMA
He was on a bus this morning He tried to
kill me

ROBERT

(a patronizing nod)
Really That’s great Thank you

Taking Giselle by the arm Robert immediately leads Giselle away
leaning in with a chastising whisper

ROBERT (contd)
What are you thinking You can’t just give
people money

GISELLE
You gave me money
(off Robert’s frustrated expression)
Besides she was so nice and so helpful
about Edward

ROBERT
She didn’t see Edward I promise

Robert shakes his head at her inexplicably bothered by the
unrelenting certainty of her convictions

ROBERT (cont’d)
Jeez what is it with you and this ‘prince’
of yours

GISELLE
What about him

ROBERT
I mean what are you telling me He’s a
‘real’ prince You’ve been like
‘betrothed’ since childhood

GISELLE
Edward and I No
(brightly)
But we fell in love the moment we met

ROBERT
Of course That’s beautiful
(turning to her)
And how long have you two been together

GISELLE
Oh about a day

Robert and Giselle walk onto one of the park’s FOOT PATHS
ROBERT

You mean it feels like a day Because
you’re so in love

GISELLE

No It’s been a day
ROBERT

You’re kidding me A day One day
GISELLE

Tomorrow it will be two days
ROBERT

Youre joking
GISELLE

Im not
ROBERT

Yes you are

GISELLE
But Im not

ROBERT
(incredulous)
Youre getting married to someone after one
day Because you fell in ‘love with him

GISELLE
Yes

71 EXT CENTRAL PARK - THE MALL - A LITTLE LATER 71

Robert and Giselle finish off hot dogs at a hot dog stand Giselle
daintily gorging on this culinary delight as Robert inquires

ROBERT
How can you talk about loving some guy you
dont even know

GISELLE
I know whats in his heart

ROBERT
Oh Right Of course
(watching as she devours the last of her hot dog)
You really like the hot dog huh Good
sauerkraut

GISELLE
Very yummy

Nodding Robert takes their wrappers and tosses them in the trash
Giselle studies Robert curiously as they continue their walk

GISELLE (cont’d)
And what about you How long have you
known your Nancy

ROBERT
Five years

GISELLE
And you haven’t proposed

ROBERT
Wellno I

GISELLE
No wonder she’s angry

Suddenly a tempting caramel covered APPLE appears in frame in
front of Giselle’s face

VENDOR (0S)
Care for a succulently sweet Caramel Apple

Robert and Giselle stop walking following the apple to REVEAL

Nathaniel in a shabby but convincing ethnic disguise standing at
a CONCESSIONS CART (a konked-out VENDOR lies hidden at his feet)

NATHANIEL (CONT’D)
(an oily smile)
No charge for the lovely lady with the long
locks

We HEAR a loud RIP in Nathaniel’s clothing Nathaniel’s eyes wide
as Pip appears eyeing the lethal fruit in Nathaniel’s hand

Pip LEAPS out to grab the apple Spying the chipmunk Nathaniel
SWATS him to the pavement before Giselle ever realizes he’s there

GISELLE
(taking the apple)
Well thank you kind sir

AS UNDER THE CART Pip takes a vicious bite of Nathaniel’s ankle

NATHANIEL
(forcing a smile through excruciating pain)
My pleasure Miss

Robert and Giselle continue along while behind them Nathaniel
STUFFS Pip in the glass popcorn maker Pip POUNDS his fists
SHAKING the entire cart Nathaniel eyes Robert and Giselle

ROBERT
I’m just saying normal people spend time
getting to know each other before they get
married They date

GISELLE
Date

ROBERT
Yeah you know A date You go out
Dinner Bowling A movie Talk

Giselle brings the apple to her mouth readying to take a bite

ROBERT (cont’d)
You know that apple’s pure poison don’t
you
(off Giselle’s startled expression)
All the preservatives in that caramel could
kill you

Giselle pulls the apple down eyeing Robert curiously

GISELLE
What kind of things do you talk about

ROBERT
About each other About yourself What
you like What you don’t like Your job
Your interests

GISELLE
(shaking her head)
You have such strange ideas about love

Giselle brings the poison caramel apple to her mouth again

ROBERT
Oh Maybe I should do it your way Meet
Have lunch Get married

She brings the apple down again just before biting

GISELLE
You forgot about “happily ever after”

ROBERT
Newsflash No relationship ends in
“happily ever after”

Giselle looks up at this ridiculous statement

GISELLE
Of course they do

EXT CENTRAL PARK - THE NAUMBURG BANDSHELL - CONTINUOUS 72

Full of STREET VENDORS OFFICE WORKERS eating lunch MOTHERS with
KIDS and STROLLERS and miscellaneous VISITORS

ROBERT
(coming to a stop)
Believe me They don’t Most marriages
are considered a success if they manage to
not end period Forget about happiness

GISELLE
How can anybody forget about happiness

ROBERT
(quietly)
It happens

Giselle stares at Robert as if she can’t quite believe what she’s
hearing She can’t

GISELLE
But you and Nancy You two will live
happily ever after You know that right

ROBERT
Look I don’t know if we’‘ll make it through
today let alone a whole lifetime

Giselle shakes her head unwilling to accept this grim scenario

ROBERT (cont‘d)
That’s what I’m trying to tell you
Giselle It’s complicated

GISELLE
Oh but it’s not

ROBERT
Oh but it is

GISELLE
(frustrated)
Only because you make it that way

Giselle pauses her emotions suddenly rising inside her flowing
out of her in an unself-conscious a cappella

GISELLE (cont’d)
(singing)
“Tf you always want to be in love forever
or maybe forever and a day”

ROBERT
(taken aback)
What are you doing

GISELLE
“Just listen to the words I give you”

All around them PEOPLE start to look up smiling at her singing

GISELLE (cont‘d)
“And then do every little thing I say”

ROBERT
(self-conscious at their stares)
Hey don’t sing okay

But Giselle KEEPS singing her voice stronger and more certain
In the grand tradition of “Under the Sea” or “Be My Guest” her
song is upbeat euphoric and more then slightly irresistible

GISELLE
“Let me give my heart to you She needs to
know those words are true”

A nearby Caribbean STEEL BAND starts to pick up on her infectious
melody Giselle’s smile invites them to play along

“So send her flowers for no reason

Please don’t do this
Plucking and sorting and arranging until in mere moments

Giselle emerges with a beautiful bouquet pretty and simple and
She lets out a WHISTLE and two DOVES fly down

GISELLE (cont’d)
(giving the birds instructions)
Could you take these to Nancy please
ROBERT
Are you crazy They don’t know where she
is They’re birds
Robert runs after Giselle trying to reign her in but he’s
as the DOVES fly the bouquet away

distracted incredulous

ROBERT (cont‘d)
Hey how’d you get them to

Robert runs right into a group of ROLLERBLADERS as they join
Giselle in an improvised carefree dance

GISELLE
“You you take my heart away”

Little KIDS and MOMS with strollers start to dance and sway along

GISELLE (cont’d)
“She needs to hear that every day”

All the while the poison apple’s been unknowingly tossed around
by the dancing people like a game of kick the can Nathaniel
scrambles on his knees through the tangle of legs to find it

EXT AN ARCH IN THE PARK -— CONTINUOUS 73

Prince Edward is conscientiously scouring the park when he HEARS
Giselle’s voice He curiously CUPS his hand to his ear

GISELLE (0S)
(her voice echoing)
“You take my heart away”

PRINCE EDWARD
My lovely Giselle

Nodding to the music he takes a moment to pick up the melody a
quick study as he sings his own a capella lyrics

PRINCE EDWARD (contd)
(singing)
“As you do mine my love”
Edward deftly leaps from the ARCH landing in front of a tunnel

A pack of RACING BICYCLISTS KNOCK the prince straight on his royal
ass leaving him a twisted mess legs akimbo moaning in pain

RENAISSANCE BALL CHRYSLER BUILDING BALLROOM FRIDAY 8pm

GISELLE (CONT’D)
“So take her dancing in the moonlight
twirl her well past midnight”

Excited Giselle pulls the poster down and hands it to Robert

GISELLE (cont’d)
“When her heart beats close to hers she’1l
know your love’s for sure”

Robert follows after her skeptically studying the poster

ROBERT
A Renaissance ball

Giselle approaches an ELDERLY MAN thrilled to be swept up in her
song as the two of them twirl the old man spinning her away

GISELLE
(as the old man ‘dips’ her)
Sounds wonderful doesn’t it

ROBERT
I don’t dance

The ROLLERBLADERS lift Robert by the arms and twirl him around
He smiles in spite of his every effort not to

GISELLE
If you don’t dance there’s only one thing
left you can do
(a sober look)
You’ll have to go all the way with her

ROBERT
Excuse me

Giselle leans in close singing to him with an unnerving intimacy

GISELLE
“When she starts to feel uncertain that
your love is hit and miss remember
nothing’s greater then the strength of
true love’s kiss”

ROBERT
True love’s kiss

GISELLE
(almost a whisper)
There’s nothing more powerful in the world

Breaking apart Giselle stands and twirls arms outstretched

GISELLE (cont’d)
“Let me give my heart to you”

Giving a ballerina’s KICK Giselle unknowingly SENDS the poison
apple into a nearby pond Nathaniel DIVES in the water after it

As we see an OVERHEAD BUSBY BERKELEY VIEW of the plaza

GISELLE (cont’d)
“She needs to know those words are true”

As Giselle sings her heart out a flock of snow white PIGEONS
swoop down swirling in joyfully fluid circles around her

GISELLE (cont’d)
“When she feels that love is here to stay”

The SQUIRRELS and RABBITS fancy sweatered DOGS out on their
walks all perk at the sound of her song The HORSES in the
hansom cabs sway their heads like so many equine Rockettes

GISELLE (cont’d)
“Then happy ever after”

Robert stares at her at all this crazy joyous pandemonium

GISELLE (cont’d)
“Will be every single day”

There can be no doubt that Giselles singing is profoundly
saccharine ridiculously sweet and despite Roberts conscious
efforts not to succumb completely enchanting

CLOSE ON ROBERT’S BLACKBERRY

As it starts to RING he CLICKS it on surprised to find it’s

I love the flowers

Robert’s eyes go wide in shock They actually got there Giselle
smiles pleased She didn’t expect anything less

EXT THE POND - MOMENTS LATER 75
A sizzling NOXIOUS GREEN SMOKE appears in the water as a gasping
Nathaniel surfaces holding the tiny shriveled poison apple A

moment later a school of DEAD FISH rise up around him

Nathaniel looks out into the square Robert and Giselle are gone

76 INT NANCY’S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER 76

Robert stares dumbfounded at Giselle’s flower arrangement the two
‘delivery’ doves COOING sweet

ROBERT
(still incredulous)
So you really like them

NANCY

I loved them Usually you just send me
those e-mail cards with the digital
flowers

(breathing in the flowers)
But these

(holding up a pair of gilded ‘ball’ tickets)
And the ball

ROBERT
We don’t have to go I just thought

NANCY
Are you kidding me This is so romantic
So spontaneous I can’t wait

ROBERT
(pleasantly surprised)
Good Wellthat’s good
(apologetic)
Listen as far as the mix-up with
Giselle

Nancy puts up a hand waving his apology away
NANCY
If you say nothing happened then nothing
happened I trust you
ROBERT
(slowly standing)
So tomorrow night then
NANCY

This is so unlike you
Nancy throws her arms around Robert catching him off guard

‘crown’ Underneath the sign says “LUXURY FIT FOR A KING”

MOTEL CLERK (0S)
It’s eighty-three fifty a night

78 INT THE ROYAL INN OFFICE -— CONTINUOUS 78

The glassy-eyed CLERK stares at these two grown men dressed in
lace britches and gold lame

MOTEL CLERK
Unless you want it bythe hour

NATHANIEL

My prince will definitely need the entire
night

MOTEL CLERK
(withholding comment)
Right Cash or major credit card

Nathaniel squints not sure what he’s talking about
A MOMENT LATER

Edward SPLAYS an array of precious GEMS from his satchel their
collective worth easily ten times more then the entire motel

The Motel Clerk’s eyes go wide at this small king’s ransom
79 INT A MOTEL ROOM - A LITTLE LATER 79

A disgusting motel room Musty carpets bad art and a locked
phone His leg badly injured from his ‘accident’ Edward lies on
the bed hopelessly fumbling with a roll of QUARTERS as he tries
to figure out how to make the bed’s MAGIC FINGERS work

As Nathaniel curiously studies the bolted-down TV FLIPPING
through the channels ESPN CNN TELEMUNDO

NATHANIEL
Perhaps it’s a magic glass box filled with
wisdom Maybe if you watch it long enough
it will tell you where Giselle is

The prince finally gets a quarter in the Magic Fingers The bed
starts to shake violently

PRINCE EDWARD
(startled his voice WARBLING from the bed)
Do you really think so

Pip ROLLS his eyes Even he can tell how ridiculous this is

NATHANIEL
Oh I’m almost certain If I were you I
wouldn’t move from that spot

As the prince leans in even closer determined not to miss a word
from the magic box

Pip JUMPS up on the bed warning Edward with an impression of
Nathaniel running out with another poison apple

PRINCE EDWARD

(looking up from the TV)
Nathaniel likes the way I leap

(Pip imitates a somnolent unconscious Giselle)
I‘m handsome even when I sleep

(as Pip grits his teeth in frustration)
Pip if you don’t mind I need to pay
attention to the magic box

Pip’s eyes go wide as he’s suddenly SWOOPED up by Nathaniel

NATHANIEL
Cute little chipmunk So tired Maybe
youd like to snuggle in a nice little nook
for the night

Nathaniel glances back at the distracted prince as he carries a
terrified Pip towards the hotel closet

INSIDE THE CLOSET - A FEW MOMENTS LATER 80

We see Pip HANGING between the metal clip of a WOODEN PANTS HANGER
as if he’s in a stockade a DO NOT DISTURB sign over his head

NATHANIEL (0S)
I think I need some fresh air my lord

Pip watches wide-eyed through the open crack in the closet door as
Nathaniel sneaks out of the room

Wiggling his feet Pip SWINGS the entire hanger in a 360 degree
gymnastic SPIN over the closet rod FLYING down onto the floor
Scurrying like a hanger ‘muppet’ past the bed to the window he
HOPS hanger-and-all up to the motel window ledge

EXT THE ROYAL INN - MOMENTS LATER 81
Pip watches Nathaniel hurry out towards the parking lot

Panicked Pip USES the hanger to WEDGE the sliding window open
The hanger finally SNAPS off and Pip scrambles after Nathaniel

EXT MANHATTAN - LATER 82
The stars are shining on a warm picture perfect New York night
INT ITALIAN FAMILY RESTAURANT DINING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

Replete with red leather booths and chianti bottle candles The
walls boast a corny cardboard diorama of Ancient Rome Morgans
at the waitress stand helping the old Italian MAMA fold napkins
This is clearly a family place she and Robert come to a lot

At a nearby table Giselle struggles to eat pizza ‘daintily’ and
fails Robert smiling at her attempt Giselle follows his gaze as
he turns to watch Morgan She smiles appreciatively

GISELLE
She’s such a wonderful girl So sweet and
kind and gentle

ROBERT
Yeah She’s great

Giselle stares at Robert something clearly weighing on her mind

ROBERT (contd)
(off her curious look)
What

GISELLE
I’m afraid to ask you

ROBERT
You want to know about her mom

GISELLE
How’d you know

ROBERT
It’s what everybody wants to know

GISELLE
Where is she

ROBERT
(a rueful smile)
Now that’s a depressing story I don’t
even like hearing that one

GISELLE
Im sorry I shouldn’t ask

ROBERT

No It’s okay If you want the very Grimm
Brothers version

(bittersweet)
Once upon a time we had a mother and a
wife But after a whileI don’t
knowshe wanted a different life

(suddenly self-conscious as he realizes)
Oh no That rhymes

(a half-smile at her)
You’‘re a dangerous influence

Robert quietly continues his story as Giselle listens

ROBERT (cont’d)
What can I tell you Two people in law
school Young Idealistic Romantic
(thoughtfully)
Baby comes Bills Fights Exhaustion
(a rueful smile)
I guess she was expecting your version of
“happily ever after”

Giselle finds herself unable to smile back For the first time
ever she’s experiencing a very fragile very human pain up
closeclose enough to touch Her voice is heavy with sympathy

GISELLE
I’m so sorry for you both

ROBERT

Thanks I’m a big boy

(nodding towards Morgan)
It’s her I worry about

(thoughtfully)
That’s why I try to keep her away from all
these fairy tale stories you know
Unrealistic expectations ridiculous
wishes I figure if she never gets her
hopes up too high she’1ll never have too
far to fall

GISELLE
That’s sad

ROBERT
That’s life

GISELLE
But dreams do come true Maybe something
wonderful could happen

Robert looks at her caving in to her indefatigable optimism

ROBERT
I forgot who I’m talking to

GISELLE
I hope you don’t forget
(smiling her voice soft)
I like talking to you

Giselle suddenly realizes that her words or rather the tone of
them reveal more than she was aware of herself

Robert senses it as well He smiles back both of them momentary
prisoners to an awkward silence that’s suddenly broken by

WAITER (0S)
(a bad Italian accent)
Fora the nice lady From a secret admirer

They both look up to see a WAITER Nathaniel in yet another
hapless disguise that nonetheless manages to fool both Robert and
Giselle He’s holding a cool green cocktail in a martini glass
ROBERT
(glancing around)
Secret admirer

GISELLE
Oh really What is it

Nathaniel sets the drink down in front of her a toxic steam
rising almost imperceptibly from the sliced green apple inside

NATHANIEL
An apple martini Miss

GISELLE
Pretty It looks yummy

Robert smiles offering up a cautionary warning

ROBERT
Careful Those things are lethal

Giselle looks up at Robert Nathaniel fights an annoyed sneer

ROBERT (cont’d)
They have a way of sneaking up on you

GISELLE
Ill just take a sip

NATHANIEL
A sip is all it takes

Nathaniel watches breathlessly a mix of anticipation and dread

As Giselle brings the icy deadly drink up to her mouth Her lips
are just about to make contact with the glass when suddenly

A small furry animal suddenly LEAPS out of nowhere onto the
checkered table clothPIP

Everyone watching in shock as Pip KNOCKS the lethal libation out
of Giselle’s hand with a Ninja-like sweep of his tail Sending it
CRASHING to the floor the glass smashing into pieces

Nathaniel fumes with fury at seeing his plot foiled
As Pip LEAPS up onto Giselle and plants a happy kiss on her

GISELLE
Pip You‘’re here

Robert’s aghast to see this vermin at his table

ROBERT
What the

Pip turns towards Robert baring his teeth in an animal HISS at
this intruder to Giselle’s affections Meanwhile Morgan has
wandered back to the table suddenly wondering as she sees Pip

MORGAN
Daddy why is Giselle talking to a

Robert pulls Morgan back

ROBERT
Don’t touch it Morgan They’re loaded
with disease

Morgan and Robert watch cluelessly as Giselle tries to talk with
the chirping nonverbal Pip but all he can do is squeak

GISELLE
I don’t understand what you’re saying

Reverting to pantomime Pip pushes his hair back into a “Prince
Edward” pompadour striking a heroic ‘Prince’ pose

GISELLE (CONTD) (cont‘d)
What The prince Here
(smiling)
That‘s wonderful

WHAAAAMMMMMM

Nathaniel suddenly SMASHES a BROOM down on the table almost
crushing Pip and igniting the broom on the table candle Giselle
Robert and Morgan leap back startled

NATHANIEL
(yelling out to the restaurant)
So sorry There’s a rat in here

The PATRONS and WAITERS react with horror at this news a
commotion breaking out as Nathaniel looks at the table to see

Pip has vanished Frantically waving his broom to extinguish it
he ENDS up fanning it into a burning torch Spotting Pip smirking
at him Nathaniel runs after him

SMASHING every checkered table Pip hops on and igniting them with
his broom torch until soon half the restaurant’s on fire

As the patrons flee in panic Robert quickly picks up Morgan
Turning to see Giselle still looking for Pip he hands Morgan to
the Italian Mama on her way out running back for Giselle

As Pip runs through people’s legs trying to escape Nathaniel
also crawling through people’s legs As Pip LEAPS into a
surprised Giselle’s arms Nathaniel swipes at them with his broom

Robert LEAPING into the fray to wrestle the burning broom away
Jumping on Nathaniel Pip POUNDS away on Nathaniel’s head (just
like the troll earlier) but Nathaniel manages to break free As
the plastic GRAPES and IVY ignite

Robert drags an unwilling Giselle out the door leaving Pip not
only frustrated that he couldn’t connect with her but alone with
the still vengeance-crazed Nathaniel literally hot on his tail
EXT THE ITALIAN RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS 84
Robert and Giselle hurry outside Fire trucks pulling up and
crowds gathering as Morgan runs up to greet them Giselle stares
into the burning restaurant worried and wondering about Pip

A moment later a NEWS VAN pulls up

INT THE ITALIAN RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS 85

The fire has spread to the cardboard mural of Rome THE BASILICA
THE COLOSSEUM and THE PANTHEON all in flames

An angry Nathaniel appears against the backdrop of the burning
empire Scanning the room he sees Pip TRAPPED at the last table

SMASH Nathaniel’s burning broom almost lands on top of him

Pip JUMPS to the floor as Nathaniel chases the chipmunk into a
corner raising his burning torch to finally smother his little
foe Just as Pip is waiting to be ‘extinguished’

Nathaniel’s KNOCKED OVER by the high pressure BLAST of a FIRE HOSE
from the Firemen entering the building Laid down FLAT on his
face from the hose Nathaniel rolls over unsettled to feel his
mouth filled with some unknown substance

His gag reflex pushes him to spit out the offending matter Pip

As a disgusted Pip tries to wipe off the saliva he looks up to
see Nathaniel TRAPPING him from above with an upside-down glass

INT THE ROYAL INN MOTEL - CONTINUOUS 86
Prince Edward is still channel surfing for some word of Giselle

PARTY LINE GIRL
(on the TV)
Hey there all you single guys Hot local
women in your area are waiting to meet you
on the Party Phone Line

Edward flips the channel coming to a NEWS BREAK in progress

TV REPORTER
Apparently an altercation with a rodent led
to this four alarm fire

He spots Giselle Standing behind yellow tape she mouths the
words ‘Pip’ as she scans the street Robert appears behind her
Morgan beside him as he leads Giselle into his apartment building

Horrified the prince leaps with his sword to his feet at the
sight of his damsel in distress suddenly GASPING with pain from
his injuries

PRINCE EDWARD
Giselle What villainry is this
(falling to his knees he clutches the TV)
Magic box I beg you Tell me where she is
that I might affect her rescue

TV REPORTER

Columbus

PRINCE EDWARD
(gratefully embracing the TV)
Thank you
(LEAPING to his feet sword raised)
77th and Columbus

As Edward LIMPS from the room we STAY ON THE TV Nathaniel
emerges from the crowd looking for Giselle holding a wiggling TO
GO BOX with Pip trapped inside as he walks past the TV Reporter

NATHANIEL
(shouting into the to go box at Pip)
Silence you hairy little toad

TV REPORTER
(looking up annoyed)
Excuse me

87 INT ROBERT’S APARTMENT - LATER 87

Giselle sits on Morgan’s bed with her talking her spirits
clearly buoyed by the knowledge that Edward’s coming for her

GISELLE
Were you scared back there

MORGAN
A little Do you think Pip will be okay

GISELLE

Oh I wouldn’t worry about Pip He’s very
brave I remember one time that poor wolf

was being chased by Little Red Riding Hood
in his grandmother’s house And she had an
axe

(off Morgan’s wide-eyed reaction)
If Pip hadn’t been walking past to help

MORGAN
(confused)
I don’t remember that version

GISELLE
(holding her tongue)
That’s because Red tells it a little
differently

PULLING BACK we REVEAL Robert at the door listening to this
strange tale and smiling in spite of it

88 EXT THE ITALIAN RESTAURANT - LATER 88

The last of the fire trucks roar away leaving the burned-out
bistro surrounded by yellow tape Edward steps into frame

Surveying these surroundings he counts the doors from the
restaurant setting off towards Robert’s Apartment

EXT ROBERT‘S APARTMENT - LATER 89
Robert’s DOOR MAN stands at the front desk as we PULL OUT beyond
the open FRONT DOOR to see Edward pressed stealthily against the
building sword at the ready on a mission of daring as

RING The Doorman picks up the phone setting it down a moment
later as he walks into the back room

Edward seizing on this moment to sneak inside and up the stairs

INT ROBERT’S APARTMENT BUILDING FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - LATER

Edward stares at a row of identical doors that seems to stretch to
infinity He tentatively KNOCKS on the first door

As a middle-age FLOOZY answers drink in hand a cigarette voice

FLOOZY
Where’s my pizza doll

Edwards eyes go wide as WE CUT TO a few more ‘MYSTERY’ DOORS
- An OLD ASIAN MAN his Siamese cat HISSING at Edward

- A FAT MAN in leather his initial scowl turning to a smile
INT ROBERT’S LIVING ROOM - LATER 91

Unable to sleep Giselle is curiously making her way through

Morgan’s “Famous Women Biography Series” book utterly fascinated
by the lives of these accomplished women Giselle turns to see a
boxer clad Robert emerging from the shower his hair still wet

ROBERT
Listen Giselle That was a nice story
About your chipmunk friend and all but

GISELLE
Umyes

ROBERT
I know what it’s like when someone
disappoints you It’s tempting to want to
see things how you wish they were instead
of how they are

GISELLE
I don’t ‘wish’ that he’s coming Robert
He is

ROBERT

Right Because the chipmunk told you

GISELLE
That’s right Pip said that actually he

ROBERT
(putting up a hand)
Listen Giselle I don’t know if you’re
being funny or ironic but chipmunks can’t
talk

GISELLE
(thoughtfully)
Apparently not here

ROBERT
(gently)

Soin lieu of taking advice from a forest
rodent I just wanted to tell you If it
did turn out you decided to stay in New
York I could help you If you needed to
talk to an immigration lawyer or get a
job find a place I’d like to help

But Robert’s generous offer only leaves Giselle more confused

GISELLE
That’s very kind Robert but Edward is
coming for me

While Robert’s increasingly troubled by her refusal to face facts

ROBERT
Yeah but if he doesn’t

Giselle’s confusion turns to actual annoyance at his ‘rude’ tone

GISELLE
Why do you keep saying that

ROBERT
Because I deal with this stuff every day
Usually when a relationship has ‘issues’
from the get-go things don’t get much
better

GISELLE
He is coming

ROBERT
Giselle I don’t think so I

GISELLE
Yes

ROBERT
Id have to disagree No

Until quite unexpectedly Giselle suddenly explodes

GISELLE
Is that the only word you know ‘No’

ROBERT
(caught off guard by her outburst)
No
(catching himself)
I-I meanno

GISELLE
(a full blown tirade clinching her fists)
No No No Over and over again Every
word you say Robert sometimes you just
make me so

ROBERT
Make you sowhat

Giselle suddenly pauses wondering what exactly she is feeling
Her face fills with a sudden epiphany as the word comes out

GISELLE
‘Angry’
(slowly turning to Robert amazed)
I think I’m ‘angry’

ROBERT
(confused)
Really

Giselle nods her breathing suddenly ragged as this inexplicable
‘feeling’ her face flush with excitement

GISELLE
Yes I feel very
(struggling to find the words)
UmVery

ROBERT
(stepping forward)
Are you okay

Concerned Robert lightly touches Giselle’s shoulder and Giselle
inhales sharply glancing at his hand and back again

GISELLE
Oh yes
(suddenly noticing his well built chest)
I’m fine

ROBERT
You sure

GISELLE
Uh-huh
(trying not to stare staring anyway)
Fit as a fiddle

ROBERT
Okay ‘Night

Robert turns and walks back to his room Giselle helplessly taking
in the view from the other side flustered as she swallows hard

Bright light floods the hallway as an exhausted Edward drags
himself down the hall ringing the last bell on the last door

Morgan opens the door and goes wide-eyed

PRINCE EDWARD

Giselle stands at the counter her eyes wide as the toast suddenly
POPS UP from the toaster like a jack-in-the-box

GISELLE

MORGAN (0S)
Daddy Someone’s here

Robert looks up from the scrambled eggs he’s making at the stove”

ROBERT
Who is it

They hear a boisterous royal male voice from the front hall

PRINCE EDWARD (0S)
It is I Prince Edward of Andalasia

Robert slowly turns around This can’t be real

PRINCE EDWARD (contd)
Come to seek my lovely bride the fair

Giselle
ROBERT
(quietly)
Oh my
GISELLE

(looking up at Robert)
He’s here

ROBERT
Apparently

Giselle anxiously leaps up a bundle of nerves

GISELLE
Oh my Oh my goodness How do I look
ROBERT
(candidly)

Slightly stunned

GISELLE
I meant how do I look

ROBERT
(taking a longer look)
You lookbeautiful

Staring wistfully at her Robert realizes his remark was much more
honest then he intended Giselle realizes it as well Before
either has a chance to respond

PRINCE EDWARD
Giselle

Giselle and Robert walk from the kitchenette into the LIVING ROOM
just as Morgan escorts Prince Edward in Edward beams as he
finally sees the object of his quest Giselle beams back

GISELLE
Edward

Stepping towards each other the prince lifts Giselle high in the
air in an exuberantly romantic TWIRL His feelings swell until
suddenly he breaks into a heartfelt a cappella

PRINCE EDWARD (CONT’D)
(singing)
“Tt seems like forever we’ve been apart”

ROBERT
(looking to Giselle)
He sings too

Edward’s sword KNOCKS several knickknacks off the coffee table
Robert quickly picks them up and places them back on the table

ROBERT (cont’d)
No problem Nothing broken

PRINCE EDWARD
“But now here you are close to my”

As Prince Edward SWINGS Giselle back around counter-clockwise
KNOCKING them off all over again

ROBERT
(cutting him off as he CATCHES them)
--heart Right Could you please be
careful

Suddenly taking note of Robert Edward angrily draws his sword and
brandishes it at Robert who steps back slightly terrified

PRINCE EDWARD
You You’re the one who’s been holding my
Giselle captive
(taking out his sword)
Do you have any last words before I
dispatch you

ROBERT
What the hell

PRINCE EDWARD
Strange words

Giselle quickly steps in front of Robert blocking the sword

GISELLE
No it’s alright Edward
(taking Morgan’s hand as well)
These are my friends

PRINCE EDWARD
Oh
(resheathing his sword he continues singing)
“Take my hand and show me your smile we’ll
be home in a very short while”

But as Edward keeps singing Giselle’s looks at him inexplicably
distracted

PRINCE EDWARD (cont’d)
“And all in the kingdom will sing along as
we share in our joyous wedding”

The prince suddenly stops mid-lyric staring at Giselle confused

GISELLE
What’s wrong

PRINCE EDWARD
(troubled)
You’re not singing

Giselle’s suddenly self-conscious as she realizes

GISELLE
Oh I’m not
(apologetic)
I’m sorry I was just thinking

PRINCE EDWARD
Thinking

GISELLE
(a little nervously)
Before we leave there was just one thing I
was hoping to do It’s a strange exotic
custom they partake of here

PRINCE EDWARD
Name it my love and it is done

GISELLE
I want to go on a date

PRINCE EDWARD
(clueless)
A date

Giselle hesitates as she nervously explains

GISELLE

Umyes

(a wary glance at Robert)
You know We could go out to dinner Talk
about ourselves What we like What we
dont like Interests

(an uncertain smile)
A date

EXT ROBERT’S BUILDING - A LITTLE LATER 96

Prince Edward stands at the street striking a self-aggrandizing
‘prince’ poses as he impatiently waits for

Giselle standing at the front stoop with Robert and Morgan this
sudden and unexpected goodbye having caught them all off guard

GISELLE

And remember Any time you’d like to visit
Andalasia

ROBERT
(trying to sound positive)
Sure Maybe if you ever come to town we
could all go out for dinner

GISELLE
That would be lovely

But their hopefulness sounds a bit forced a sense in their voices
that neither believes this

ROBERT
We’‘ll all see each other soon It’s not

like we’‘re talking about you know
forever

GISELLE
(an unconvincing smile)
-eand ever

ROBERT
Soumgood luck on your date

GISELLE
And you with Nancy

Giselle kneels next to Morgan taking her small face in her hands

GISELLE (cont’d)
It’s been wonderful spending time with you
Morgan I

Giselle’s words are suddenly cut short as Morgan wraps her arms
tightly around Giselle’s neck squeezing her tight

Giselle tightly hugs Morgan back as Robert watches their
embrace

Edward gently taps Giselle’s shoulder Giselle gives a last brave
backward wave as Edward leads her away with a parting salvo

PRINCE EDWARD
Thank you for taking care of her peasants

MORGAN
(an aside to Robert)
Peasants

ROBERT
(quietly)
He meant it in a nice wayI think

Walking to the curb Edward and Giselle are nearly knocked over by
a large JUG OF WATER carried by a SPARKLETTS DELIVERY GUY each
dodging the other As the Delivery guy passes them we see

Narissa’s angry FACE suddenly appears in the bottom of the
container glaring at Edward and Giselle

INT AN UPSCALE MANHATTAN BAR - MOMENTS LATER 97

A terrified Nathaniel stares down into his large Martini as a
fuming Queen Narissa GLARES up from between the olives

NATHANIEL
I don’t know how they found each other my
sweet goddess I know how much her
untimely death would have cheered you up
and I was trying so hard Perhaps if you
could see your way to giving me one more
chance

QUEEN NARISSA
Another chance There’s only one apple
left you spineless slug You’re out of
chances

Nathaniel nervously CLAMPS down on his WIGGLING to-go box Pip
The BARTENDER nervously eyes the drunk talking to his drink

NATHANIEL
Your majesty You don’t mean

QUEEN NARISSA
Im coming there
(screaming out in anger)
I‘LL KILL THAT LITTLE WRETCH MYSELF

CRACKKK

Nathaniel’s martini glass suddenly EXPLODES from Narissa’s VOICE
Followed a moment later by

The late afternoon sun hangs high over the library as we MOVE DOWN
to the sidewalk Edward and Giselle walking into view

Wearing a green foam Statue of Liberty crown an unkempt exhausted
Edward clutches the hard won trophies of their all-day ‘date’ a
Central Park Zoo balloon and a cardboard model of the Empire State
Building listening cluelessly as Giselle chatters away

GISELLE
--l want to stay busy after the wedding
Of course there’s the ceremonial duties
which I’m quite happy to do But with all
my spare time I thought I could do other
things Maybe some volunteer work

PRINCE EDWARD
(confused)
What about our happily ever after

GISELLE
Oh I’m very excited about that I was
thinking more about the day after happily
ever after”
(suddenly brightening as she spots)
Oh look Hot dogs

Giselle hurries to the stand as a tired Edward follows after a
lost expression as Giselle orders in some odd foreign language

GISELLE (cont’d)

I need two dogs Kraut Mustard The
works And a couple of root beers to wash
‘em down

(turning to Edward still talking)
I thought we could do a soup kitchen for
the peasants Or maybe even a small
business I mean besides the butcher the
baker and the candlestick maker theres
really nothing in the way of shopping

Edward smiles patiently not understanding a word she’s saying

As a small family of stubby Midwestern TOURISTS suddenly approach
HARRY KLEEBERG of Canton Ohio with his wife DORIS and two kids
sullen pre-teen LEN and his asthmatic little sister DIEDRA

HARRY KLEEBERG
Hey you guys look great Can we get a
picture with you

Before they can answer Giselle and Edward are jostled into a
group pose by the Kleeburgs Giselle’s taken aback as she looks
into their eyes feeling them staring back as if she and Edward
are some sort of curiosity for their passing entertainment

DORIS KLEEBURG
(squeezing between Giselle and Edward)
Well aren’t you two the cutest couple

PRINCE EDWARD
(pleased)
Thank you We’re to be wed tomorrow
Mrs Kleeberg brays with nasally delight to her daughter

DORIS KLEEBURG

Did you hear that Diedra The prince and

princess are going to fairyland to get

married

Giselle looks at Doris not at all liking the way that sounds

HARRY KLEEBERG
Say cheese sandwich

The camera captures Giselle’s forced smile the mocking nature of
this moment clearly not lost on her

99 INT ROBERT’S OFFICE - LATER 99

A stunned Robert sits across from Katherine and Stephen watching
disturbed as they hold hands and trade loving glances

STEPHEN
I was thinking about what that girl said
About Katherine’s eyes’ sparkling You
know that’s the first thing I noticed when
we met

(turning adoringly to Katherine)

I mean look at her It’s true They
really do sparkle

KATHERINE
(a blushing smile)
Stephen

They share a spontaneously loving kiss Robert framed between them
as he shakes his head in disbelief his voice grave with concern

ROBERT
Look I have to say as your attorney
Katherine and Stephen I’m sure Henry will
back me up you’re both acting very
impetuously here This sounds like a
purely emotional reaction

STEPHEN
I know Isn’‘t it wonderful
ROBERT
(insistently)

I mean you shouldn’t let a chance meeting
with one admittedly somewhat charming but
very headstrong and definitely misguided
girl cause you to alter the course of your
entire life

KATHERINE
Maybe it wasn’t a ‘chance’ Maybe it was
no accident we met her

ROBERT
(shaking his head resistant to this idea)
Im sorry I find that very hard to
believe

STEPHEN
Maybe you need to try harder

ROBERT
Look you guys had problems
(lifting up a heavy file)
I have hundreds of pages of depositions
here

KATHERINE
Everyone has problems Everyone has bad
times Do we sacrifice all of the good
times because of it

Robert stares at a loss no longer certain of this question

ROBERT
You’‘re not making me feel like a very good
divorce attorney

KATHERINE
Maybe you’re not

100 EXT NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY - LATER 100

Giselle and Edward are perched upon the library lions finishing
their hot dogs There’s an awkward ‘first date’ silence between
them the kind that suggests there isn’t going to be a ‘second’
Giselle tries her best to keep the conversation going

GISELLE
Did you like your hot dog

PRINCE EDWARD
Oh Yes Very good’dog’

GISELLE
And the “sour” kraut

PRINCE EDWARD
Quite excellent

Regally stuffing the last bit of bun in his mouth Edward grandly
announces

PRINCE EDWARD (cont’d)
Well that was a splendid ‘date’
(chivalrously extending his arm)
Shall we go

GISELLE
Where

PRINCE EDWARD
Back to Andalasia To be married and live
together happily ever after forever and
ever

Giselle’s face tightens at the mention of ‘forever’ She
unconsciously hears herself suddenly stalling for time

GISELLE
Well we don’t have to go right away

PRINCE EDWARD
How long do these ‘dates’ usually last

GISELLE

(vamping)
As long as you want them to They can just
keep going and going if you keep thinking
of things to do There’s all sorts of
activities

(an enthusiastic litany)
We could go bowling Or to a movie

(suddenly remembering)
There’s even this ball

PRINCE EDWARD
(something he actually recognizes)
A ball

GISELLE
You’d like that Dancing Music

PRINCE EDWARD
Well I suppose but

GISELLE
Wonderful We have to go

Edward sighs this ‘date’ business starting to wear on him

PRINCE EDWARD
And then home to Andalasia

GISELLE
Of course

The moment it’s over

Standing Giselle enthusiastically squeezes Edward’s hands
climbing down from the library lions as they continue to talk

GISELLE (cont’d)
Oh I have so much to do to get ready I
have to figure out what to wearmy hair

PRINCE EDWARD
And what shall I do

GISELLE
(politely looking him over)
There’s something really magical here I
think you should probably try

PRINCE EDWARD
What is it

GISELLE
A ‘shower’

101 INT MORGAN‘S BEDROOM - LATER 101

Morgan stands alone in her bedroom staring at her full length
mirror a wistful expression on her face as we realize

She’s dressed in a ‘princess’ outfit not dissimilar to Giselle’s
wedding gown Spying something in the corner of the mirror
Morgan looks closer suddenly delighted to see

The reflection of Giselle standing in the room with her Morgan
turns and runs to her the both of them embracing

MORGAN
Giselle You’re back

Giselle kneels down frantically before Morgan

GISELLE
I need your help I’m going to the ball
and I’m not sure what to do or what I
should wear and I don’t even know where to
find a fairy godmother at this late hour

Giselle sits patiently at the make-up counter Morgan sharing her
prepubescent pearls of wisdom with Giselle as she slathers a
frighteningly thick layer of make-up on her

MORGAN
You don’t want to wear too much make-up
‘cause otherwise boys get the wrong idea
and you know how they are They’re only
after one thing

GISELLE

What is it

MORGAN
I’m not sure
(almost embarrassed to admit it)
Nobody will tell me

you You were such a big help

MORGAN
(flattered)

Really

GISELLE
Really

MORGAN
Thanks

GISELLE

You’re welcome

Morgan returns to her magazine turning back to Giselle a moment
later as she asks in an uncertain whisper

MORGAN
So is this what it’s like

GISELLE
What sweetie

Morgan hesitates softly answering

MORGAN
Going shopping with your mother

GISELLE
I don’t know I never went shopping with
my mother

MORGAN
Me either

There’s a long silent beat between them Giselle smiles

GISELLE
But I like it

Giselle wraps her arm around Morgan an encouraging hug

GISELLE
Just think Soon you’ll have a new mother

MORGAN
You mean stepmother

You know Edward’s got a stepmother I’ve
never met her but I hear she’s just

The ballroom’s been lavishly converted into a 16th Century Palace

An ORCHESTRA plays courtly minuets while Accountants Lawyers
Doctors and other sundry white collar executives masquerade as

As a splintered IMAGE slowly appears in the waters spray
A sweeping TILT DOWN from the top of the Chrysler building to the
front doors as Giselle and Prince Edward (now cleaned up and
sparkling) walk into the lobby
A smile of absolute evil spreads across the queen’s face
Her delight suddenly interrupted by Nathaniel’s anxious voice
NATHANIEL
When you have a chance I really need to
speak to you about our relationship

Narissa’s eyes go wide in indignant outrage at this presumption

Throwing her black hood over her head she turns backwards both
Nathaniel and Pip reacting with mute horror at what they see

INT THE CHRYSLER BALLROOM - A LITTLE LATER 114

NANCY
So Anything specific you want to talk
about

I guess I’ve been mulling the two of us
over These last few days especially
94

Robert’s suddenly CUT OFF by an audible GASP of wonder from the
crowd Robert and Nancy turn to the source of this amazement

AT THE TOP OF THE GRAND STAIR CASE

Stands a young woman the princely gentlemen next to her helping
her off with coat to reveal

GISELLE
Utterly resplendent in a stunning modern dress

Elegant svelte and strikingly sexy her hair now short and
styled the height of sophistication

She’s even wearing a fabulous pair of clear GLASS designer heels

Giselle looks around suddenly conscious of the fact that she’s
the only modern woman in a room full of fairy tale characters
Glancing down at her ensemble she takes a breath and bravely
takes her first step down the stairs

And while every eye in the room is on Giselle her eyes can’t help
but fall on

Robert staring back at her helplessly overwhelmed
NANCY
(off Robert’s stare)
What is she doing here

ROBERT
I have no idea

Robert looks at Nancy and then Giselle not at all sure himself

Edward follows a step behind as Giselle floats like a vision down
the stairs

Robert stepping forward to greet her at the landing each sharing
a poorly concealed delight at seeing the other

ROBERT (cont’d)
Im a little surprised to see you

GISELLE
Im surprised too You told me you
couldn’t dance

ROBERT
I said I didn’t I never said I can’t

Standing behind Giselle Edward takes in Giselle’s inexplicable
‘rapport’ with this peasant He conspicuously clears his throat

GISELLE
Oh excuse me This is Edward
(by now a tad self-conscious)
He’‘s myprince

Robert extends his hand in cordial greeting

ROBERT
We met earlier You pulled a sword on me
(turning to Nancy)
This is Nancy She’s my

Change of partners for our next dance
please

Unflinchingly polite Edward gives Nancy a courtly bow and extends
his hand

PRINCE EDWARD
May I have the pleasure

Leaving Nancy little choice but to accept the two of them dancing
away Nancy craning her head back at Robert

As Robert and Giselle are left standing alone

Staring in each others eyes as Robert offers his hand Giselle
gives a slight curtsy as she takes it

The two of them slipping into the flow of the other dancers on the
floor Thrown together in this intimate embrace Giselle self-
consciously admits

GISELLE
I feel so foolish Dressed like this

Robert looks at her the words pouring out of him

ROBERT
You look beautiful

GISELLE

(shyly)
Thank you

ROBERT
(a little shy too)
How’s your date

GISELLE
I’m sorry

ROBERT
Your date With the prince

GISELLE
(suddenly remembering)
Oh It’s goingsplendidly

ROBERT
That’s good I’m glad

GISELLE
I’m glad too And you and Nancy
Congratulations are in order

ROBERT
(weakly)
Well practically I guess I have you to
thank for bringing us back together
GISELLE
(a brave smile)
Wellcongratulations

Their eyes locked on one another Robert and Giselle slowly dance
out into the center of the ballroom

The rest of the room FALLING away as we stay on this beautiful
couple

“Beauty and the Beast” “Cinderella” “The King and I” all the
greatest romantic dancing moments in the history of great romantic
dance moments suddenly finding their successor in these two

The music SWELLING to a lush crescendo which culminates in

A sparkling shower of golden GLITTER falling from the ceiling
Raining gentle clouds of magic dust on the dancing couples below

WHILE ACROSS THE ROOM 115

Nancy dances with Prince Edward each casting jealous glances over
at Robert and Giselle

NANCY
So you two are like an item

PRINCE EDWARD
Giselle is the love of my life my
intended my heart’s true desire

NANCY
Wow

PRINCE EDWARD
Is something wrong

NANCY
Just the way you said that So
straightforward and unself-conscious Not
a hint of irony
(smiling)
It’s veryromantic

PRINCE EDWARD
Well thank you

Both of them suddenly looking up in surprise to see
ROBERT AND GISELLE GLIDING PAST THEM 116

Her emotions swelling Giselle presses her head to Roberts
shoulder He holds her tight as she speaks in a breathless voice

GISELLE
You really are a lovely dancer

ROBERT
It was your suggestion

GISELLE
I guess it was

We CUT between their expressions of unspoken yearning They’ve
never been this close to one another and yet at the same time
never further apart

Suddenly leaning in Robert speaks to Giselle in the only way he
possibly can in this stolen moment

He sings

A soft sweet almost awkward half-whisper following along with
the SINGER in the band A declaration of profound affection
safely hidden in the words of this sweet melody

Giselle closes her eyes feeling a rush of inner delight Opening
them again she smiles at Robert their faces now close enough to
kiss

The moment shattered as Giselle feels a TAP on her shoulder She
turns to see Nancy behind her nodding towards Robert

NANCY
You don’t mind do you

GISELLE
(stepping back)
Oh no Not at all
Giselle’s face fills with surprise at their sudden separation

Robert offering a sad parting glance as Nancy twirls him away

Leaving Giselle standing by herself at the grand staircase
looking as alone as when she first arrived in New York

Gone is the happy girl from the Fairy Tale In her place is a
grown-up ‘woman’ her heart half-lost to a new world she knows
holds no place for her As she fights her welling tears

A light rain starts to fall outside mirroring Giselle’s mood

PRINCE EDWARD (0S)
Are you ready to go home now

Giselle turns to Edward who casts a jealous glance at Robert
GISELLE
(quietly resigned)
Yes Edward Finally I am
Taking Giselle’s hand Edward escorts her
UP THE BALLROOM’S GRAND STAIRCASE 117

Gently lifting Giselle’s chin as they climb

PRINCE EDWARD
Youre crying

Stealing a backwards glance down at Robert and Nancy Giselle
forces a smile telling the first lie in her life

GISELLE
Only with happiness

Edward’s pleased to hear this as they arrive at
INT THE UPPER LEVEL OF THE BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS 118

He sets her by one of the upstairs pillars reassuring her

PRINCE EDWARD
Ill get your wrap We can finally leave
this madness behind

Edward hurries away leaving a forlorn Giselle alone half of her
in the light the other half in the darkness of the alcove

The thunder of the approaching storm echoes in the distance the
increasingly heavy rain pounding against the windows behind her

Feeling an inexplicable chill Giselle suddenly turns startled to
see

The dark SILHOUETTE of a female figure standing by the pillars
Giselle watches unnerved as the woman steps forward slowly taking
off her hood to reveal

It’s the OLD HAG

More hideous then ever in this ‘live’ incarnation Her pale skin
glows with a sickly corpse-like pallor She smiles at Giselle

OLD HAG
Hello my dear

GISELLE
You

OLD HAG

I’m so glad to see you child I’ve been
so worried Such a terrible accident
you’re coming to this place

The hag’s eyes move knowingly past Giselle to Robert and Nancy
dancing in the ballroom below Somehow Giselle knows this woman
sees right through her deepest feelings lay bare before her

OLD HAG (cont’d)

(her voice soft with empathy)
So much sadness here So much pain To
never be with the one you love doomed to
spend eternity with another

(a toothless yet eerily tender smile)
It doesn’t have to be like that I can
help you forget all this hurt make all the
bad memories disappear

The old hag reaches into her robes and presents a perfect glossy
SHINY RED APPLE Giselle stares at it ripe and red and luscious

OLD HAG (cont‘d)
One bite my love and all this will go
away New York your time here

(MORE)

OLD HAG (cont’d)

You won’t remember anything Just sweet

dreams and happy endings But you must

hurry The magic won’t work unless you

take a bite before the clock strikes

twelve
Giselle looks at the apple so easy so tempting Tortured and
torn she turns her gaze down to the dance floor just in time to
see
Nancy lean in and kiss Robert
The most powerful force on earth
Giselle exhales all her hopes and dreams pouring out of her like
a last breath She closes her eyes in torment and lifts the apple
to her lips
CLOSE ON THE OLD HAG
A THUNDERBOLT CRASHES as the hag lets out a peeling CACKLE of
wicked TRIUMPH Her evil eyes follow Giselle as she FALLS to the
floor We HEAR the THUMP of a body and see
GISELLE’S HAND 119
Landing on the floor The bitten apple ROLLS from her fingers
DOWN THE GRAND STAIRCASE
INT THE BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS 120

ACROSS THE DANCE FLOOR past oblivious guests through the feet of
dancing partners until it comes to rest next to a man’s foot

Roberts

He picks up the apple confused suddenly hearing a vicious LAUGH
Following the sound Robert looks up startled to see

ON THE UPPER BALCONY
An old hag throwing Giselle over her shoulder and hurrying away
BACK ON THE DANCE FLOOR

A shocked Robert doesn’t hesitate leaving Nancy in his wake as he
pushes into the throng of gawking guests towards the stairs

A confused Nancy wading into the crowds after him
INT THE UPPER LEVEL OF THE BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS 121

Giselle on her shoulder the hag PUSHES her way through the crowd

OLD HAG
Out of my way

The hag rushes with Giselle into an OPEN BALLROOM ELEVATOR
INT THE BALLROOM ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 122

The OLD HAG quickly presses the DOWN BUTTON as the elevator doors
begin to CLOSE We HEAR her supremely self-pleased LAUGHTER

As the Hag’s cowl FALLS to REVEAL that she is once again Queen
Narissa giddily triumphant at the success of her evil plan

But just as the elevator doors are almost closed
SLASSSSHHHH

A SWORD BLADE rips through the crack in the doors

Narissa looks down in shock and surprise

As the sword WEDGES the doors back OPEN She looks up to see
Prince Edward staring at her his eyes wide in shock

PRINCE EDWARD
Mother

Narissa looks back startled to have been found out A fuming
fury starts to overtake the prince as he begins to realize

PRINCE EDWARD (cont’d)
You did this

QUEEN NARISSA
Edward No

Wedging the elevator doors open with his feet a seething Edward
directs at the point of his blade OUT of the elevator

INT THE UPPER LEVEL OF THE BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS 123

Still carrying Giselle Narissa backpedals as Prince Edward BACKS
her up towards the ballroom

QUEEN NARISSA
You don’t understand I was only trying to
help her

As they arrive at the balcony’s edge Narissa makes a show of
gently setting Giselle down

PRINCE EDWARD
You evil wretch

QUEEN NARISSA
(indignantly)
Don’t take that tone with me young man
Im your mother

PRINCE EDWARD
Stepmother

Unconvinced Edward presses his blade to her neck Her guilt
exposed Narissa HISSES indignantly

QUEEN NARISSA
You fool Who else was going to save you
from your lack of judgement

INT THE BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS 124

All of the crowd below now turned to watch this unfolding ‘drama’
on the UPPER LEVEL with rapt attention

INT THE BALLROOM CATWALK - CONTINUOUS 125

Seeing this unfolding ‘theatre’ the LIGHTING GUYS shift their
spotlights from the ‘band’ up to the “damsel in distress”

INT THE UPPER LEVEL OF THE BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS 126

Robert finally makes his way to the top of the stairs Nancy at
his heels as he rushes to Giselle Kneeling down he urgently
feels her pulse

ROBERT
Oh no
(looking up at Nancy)
Call 911

Nancy quickly reaches for her Blackberry dialing
NANCY
(into the phone)

Hello We have a young woman here

QUEEN NARISSA
You‘ll never save her now

Staring at Giselle’s fallen form Edward turns angrily to Narissa
PRINCE EDWARD

I am the future King Your wickedness will
not stand
QUEEN NARISSA
(aghast at this challenge to her)
How dare you speak to me like that

The Queen raises her arms high in a sorceresss arc to cast a
spell on Edward but he grabs her and locks them around her back
She SQUEALS in pain

NANCY
(urgently to Robert)
They’re asking what’s wrong

ROBERT
I’m not sure
(looking at the apple realizing)
I think it’s some kind of poison

127 DONNNNGGGG 127
We HEAR the low RUMBLE of a CHURCH BELL in the distance We CUT
between this tense tableau and grand old CLOCKS around the city
sounding out the TWELVE CHIMES before the STROKE OF MIDNIGHT
Narissa laughs wickedly
QUEEN NARISSA (CONT’D)
There’s nothing you can do When the clock
strikes twelve she’ll be dead

Edward angrily covers Narissa’s mouth with his hand leaving her
gasping with muffled indignation

PRINCE EDWARD
Youre finished Narissa You will never
return to the throne

128 DONNNNGGGG 128

Robert presses his hand against Giselle’s skin Cold to the
touch her pallor is turning a deadly white

ROBERT
We’re losing her She’s fading

129 DONNNNGGGG 129
PRINCE EDWARD

(panicked)
Weve got to help her What can we do
130 DONNNNGGGG 130

Robert looks into Giselle’s face his intense feelings for her
reflected in his own

ROBERT
I don’t know I

PRINCE EDWARD
(pleading)
No Giselle My love
131 DONNNNGGGG 131

As the bells chime a quiet epiphany overtakes Robert Suddenly
he remembers The one thing that Giselle told him and him alone

132 DONNNNGGGG 132
Their panicked silence broken as Robert quietly says the words
ROBERT
True love’s kiss
(playing it back in his mind)

There’s nothing more powerful in the

world
The prince looks over at Robert quickly nodding

PRINCE EDWARD
Yes Of course I knew that

The Prince quickly steps towards Giselle

Leaving Narissa to quietly step back

As Edward gently kisses Giselle waiting for her to wake
133 DONNNNGGGG 133

Nothing Giselle doesn’t move

Everyone waits expectantly on Giselle’s reaction Edward
frantically kisses her again

Still nothing
134 DONNNNGGGG 134
PRINCE EDWARD

(frantic)
It’s not working

Robert puts his head to her chest desperately listening

ROBERT
It has to work There’s no other answer

DONNNNGGGG 135

Edward stares at Giselle knowing she’s dying desperate to save
her A transformation moves like a wave across his face his
vanity suddenly dissolving to reveal a far more nobler man within
An idea forms as Edward turns his gaze from Giselle to Robert

PRINCE EDWARD
Unless

ROBERT
Unless what

And now it’s Edward’s turn to have an epiphany chivalrously
thinking only of Giselle’s survival as the possibility occurs

PRINCE EDWARD
I’m not the one

Edward stares intently at Robert his meaning immediately clear to
him

ROBERT
No That’s not possible
(fighting him)
It couldn’t be me

DONNNNGGGG TEN STROKES 136

PRINCE EDWARD
Don’t you see It has to be

ROBERT
Are you crazy I just met her a few days
ago She and lI

NANCY (0S)
Kiss her Robert

Robert turns surprised to hear Nancy echoing Edward She looks
at him pleading with a soft urgency

NANCY (cont’d)
You may be her only hope

Robert slowly looks at Giselle Taking in her angelic face all
his doubts seem to come into doubt

137 DONNNNGGGG ONLY ONE STROKE LEFT 137

Robert hesitantly leans forward Summoning all the long dormant
faith and hope and love inside him

He tenderly gently presses his lips to Giselle’s
138 DONNNNGGGG THE STROKE OF MIDNIGHT 138

As almost instantly the flush of life rushes back to her cheeks
Suddenly Giselle starts to blink

Until she slowly opens her eyes

Looking up adoringly into the face of the one man who adores her
more than any other Her one true love She slowly smiles

GISELLE
I knew it was you

139 INT THE BALLROOM —- CONTINUOUS 139

The GUESTS break into unanimous APPLAUSE at this fabulous piece of
“Party Theatre”

AN OLDER WOMAN
(clapping and smiling)
Marvelous What did you think
AN OLDER MAN
(also clapping)
Wonderful Much better than last year’s
show

Robert and Giselle’s sweet moment of reunion is cut short as the
entire room is plunged into darkness

141 INT THE BALLROOM CATWALK - CONTINUOUS 141
The spotlights EXPLODE into sparks as the LIGHTING GUYS jump away
142 INT ANOTHER ALCOVE - CONTINUOUS 142

In the shadow of the BURNED OUT ELECTRICAL PANEL we see Narissa’s
slender HAND pull away from the object of its destruction

The hand suddenly starting to grotesquely ELONGATE and CURL

INT THE UPPER LEVEL OF THE BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS 143

Narissa’s disembodied VOICE bitter and defeated suddenly starts
to RICOCHET around the room in the blackness

QUEEN NARISSA (0S)
I have nothing now girly

We FOLLOW her voice as it moves throughout the crowd

QUEEN NARISSA (0S) (cont’d)
And it’s all because of you

The unsettling effect of her vitriolic words playing on the
anxious faces of the guests their initial nervous giggles that
this might be “part of the show” soon devolving into quiet panic

QUEEN NARISSA (0S) (cont’d)
Did you really believe

Narissa’s voice starts to change and bend growing deeper and
darker an unseen metamorphosis taking place

QUEEN NARISSA (0S) (cont’d)
That I was going to idly sit by
The crowd GASPS as they sense something moving and forming beneath
their feet We catch shadowy GLIMPSES of something sinister
slithering in the darknessscales and claws and teethmore
frightening for what they suggest than what they show

QUEEN NARISSA (0S) (cont’d)
And endure this humiliation

Narissa’s bitter diatribe builds to a frightening crescendo as she
screams out in a low almost animalistic voice

QUEEN NARISSA (0S) (cont‘d)
Someone has to suffer the consequences

Her threatening words punctuated by a deafening CRASH of THUNDER
A series of violent LIGHTNING FLASHES reveal

A large lean muscular reptilian NARISSA BEAST looming menacing
directly over Robert and Giselle

Narissas inner ugliness and evil now externalized
A slithering tail leads to a sinewy scaled body and clawed talon-

like HANDS only a trace of Narissa’s beautiful face now visible
in her rapacious animal visage

The guests SCREAM in collective horror as the Narissa Beast SCOOPS
up Robert in its claws and LEAPS down into

INT THE BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS 144
Its tail SMASHING the fountains on either side of the staircase
the panicked crowd parting as the beast runs through the lightning
flashes with its prey SCREECHING its way across the ballroom
INT A TAXI - CONTINUOUS 145
The RAIN is POURING DOWN HARD onto the pavement
Nathaniel’s parked next to the Chrysler Building Pip repeatedly
BANGS his hamster ball against the car door to escape and help
Giselle as Nathaniel conducts a thoughtful “self-help” inventory
NATHANIEL

I mean I’m a person too I have feelings

I deserve better then this
CRRRRRASSSSSHHHH
EXT THE TAXI - CONTINUOUS 146
Nathaniel steps out of the taxi following this jarring sound
upward to see the TAIL END of the huge Narissa beast BURSTING out
OVER THE SIDE of the Chrysler Building crown huge CHARDS of glass
FALLING down towards the street

NATHANIEL
(horrified)

What’s she done now

EXT THE CHRYSLER BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 147

Nathaniel runs from the taxi towards the Chrysler Building Pip
immediately starts ‘pushing’ his hamster wheel out of the car

INT THE BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS 148

As the ballroom SAFETY LIGHTS illuminate to a dim glow

The guests stare in horror at the GAPING HOLE left in the building
by the escaping beast the howling WIND and RAIN blowing past the
band stand now a smashed up stage of broken chairs and abandoned
instruments left from the beast’s rampage out of the building

As most of the panicked guests hurry towards the stairs

INT THE UPPER LEVEL OF THE BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS 149

Giselle looks out over all this devastation in utter shock

Mere moments ago she had her happy ending Now she only has a
very bad beginning her true love suddenly stolen from her

Prince Edward steps gallantly forward grandly announcing
PRINCE EDWARD
The beast must be stopped and the young man
rescued Fear not Giselle I will devise
a plan and

SWOOOSH

Edward looks down to see Giselle has impatiently GRABBED his sword
and is sliding down the staircase banister past the fleeing crowd

INT THE BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS 150
Leaping OVER a smashed fountain until she lands in a run (losing a
glass shoes in the process) bounding in giant steps towards the
gaping hole

INT THE CHRYSLER BUILDING LOBBY - CONTINUOUS 151

Nathaniel RUNS hellbent into an open elevator Pip rolling his
Hamster Ball enters the elevator a moment after him

INT THE UPPER LEVEL OF THE BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS 152

Struggling to chase after Giselle Edward is held back by the
throngs of party guests pressing against him trying to get out

PRINCE EDWARD
Excuse me Pardon me Excuse me

Despite Edward’s polite entreaties he’s knocked to the floor by
the crowd Nancy tries to help him up before he’s trampled

EXT THE CHRYSLER BUILDING CROWN - CONTINUOUS 153
As the wind and rain and thunder HOWL high above the city

The Narissa Beast rapidly climbs the side of the slippery
stainless steel holding onto Robert as he pleads for his release

ROBERT
(gasping with fear at the 77 stories below)
What are you doing Are you crazy

NARISSA BEAST
No Vengeful Spiteful Vindictive
Never ‘crazy’

GISELLE (0S)
Hold on Robert

The Narissa Beast turns back shocked to see Giselle is actually
FOLLOWING along below with her sword Roberts just as surprised

ROBERT
Giselle

Fiercely determined Giselle GRABS at the small antennae jutting
out of the building to try and keep up She SHOUTS over the rain

GISELLE
You’‘re going to be okay Robert

NARISSA BEAST
My my Quite the brave display
(pulling Robert up even higher she yells down)
Unfortunately you’ve been reading the wrong
story This one ends with a rather
pronounced ‘SPLAT’

Narissa effortlessly LEAPS with an animal agility up another tier
of the crown Determined not to lose her man

GISELLE
No

Giselle KICKS off her remaining heel watching horrified as it
soundlessly drops 77 stories below

Turning back to her task she uses the climbing skills we first
saw in the forest to scurry up after them

Down below at street level we catch dizzying glimpses of arriving
paramedics and emergency vehicles their sirens blaring

EXT THE CHRYSLER BUILDING CROWN BALCONY - CONTINUOUS 154

A crowd of curious guests has moved out of the ballroom onto the
balcony to witness this bizarre unworldly spectacle

Edward and Nancy emerge as well looking up at Giselle Robert and
the beast Pinned in by the crowd they’re helpless to help

EXT THE CHRYSLER BUILDING CROWN - CONTINUOUS 155

The Narissa beast’s claw-like hand REACHES the spire a terrified
Robert hanging precariously in the other

EXT THE BASE OF THE CROWN - CONTINUOUS 156

The unrelenting wind and rain making her footing even more
slippery Giselle grittily keeps climbing with her sword up
towards them

EXT THE CHRYSLER BUILDING CROWN BALCONY - CONTINUOUS 157

Nathaniel emerges to join Edward and Nancy among the crowd of
helpless spectators He looks up in horror as the Narissa Beast
cruelly dangles Robert from the spire A moment later

Pip ROLLS between Nathaniel’s legs POUNDING at the plastic
Hamster ball desperate to get out and help Nathaniel picks up
the ball knowingly shaking his head at his tiny foe

NATHANIEL
You just can’t wait to get out can you
Cause trouble for the queen just like you
did for me

Pip nods a frantic ‘yes’ Nathaniel takes one last pointed look
up at the Narissa beast before suddenly OPENING the plastic ball

NATHANIEL (cont’d)
Well get to it

Nathaniel and Pip share a smile of mutual purpose as Pip nimbly
scrambles over the heads of the party guests onto the building

EXT THE CHRYSLER BUILDING CROWN - CONTINUOUS 158

Hanging by one claw from the spire swinging Robert with the
other Narissa taunts Giselle still fighting to reach them

NARISSA BEAST
Do you really think you’re any match for
me You and your quaint romantic notions
“Happily ever after” “True love’s kiss”
Youre nothing but a silly naive girl

Finally catching her footing Giselle stands shouting up to her

GISELLE
Let him go He means nothing to you

NARISSA BEAST
No but he means everything to you

Giselle’s suddenly caught off guard as Pip surreptitiously runs
past her to ‘help’ He scurries up the crown sneaking to the
spire behind the oblivious still-taunting Narissa Beast

EXT THE CHRYSLER BUILDING SPIRE - CONTINUOUS 159

The Narissa Beast laughs at Giselle’s ‘show’ of bravery Leaning
in even closer she continues to scathingly mock her

NARISSA BEAST
You took away my happy ending little girl
I‘1l be damned if you see one day of yours

EXT THE BASE OF THE CROWN - CONTINUOUS 160

Fiercely gritting her teeth Giselle fights her own uncertainties
as she raises the sword aiming it towards the beast

EXT THE CHRYSLER BUILDING SPIRE - CONTINUOUS 161
As Pip JUMPS from the spire onto the Narissa beast’s head (exactly
like our opening animation sequence) angrily pounding his little

fists into her scaly skull

The miniscule addition of Pip’s tiny body mass adding just enough
extra weight to Narissa’s bulk

To suddenly cause the spire to BEND forward

Caught off guard the beast suddenly loses its equilibrium its
panicked SCRAMBLE to regain its hold causing the beast to lose its
balance altogether

The spire BENDING forward even MORE

As the beast starts to SLIP OFF IT

EXT THE BASE OF THE CROWN - CONTINUOUS 162

Summoning all her courage and strength Giselle suddenly HURLS the
sword with all her might

EXT THE CHRYSLER BUILDING SPIRE - CONTINUOUS 163
The sword BYPASSING the Narissa beast just as it LOSES its grip
Instead PINNING Robert’s sleeve to the spire

As the Narissa beast FALLS off the spire HOWLING in panic as it
RUSHES past Giselle

EXT THE CHRYSLER BUILDING GARGOYLE - CONTINUOUS 164
THUMMMPP

The beast just barely LANDS on one of the building’s EAGLE
GARGOYLES The onlookers on the adjacent balcony GASP

As Pip quickly LEAPS off the beast’s head

Landing safely in a surprised Nathaniel’s arms at the edge of the
balcony Finally embracing their ‘relationship’ Nathaniel holds
Pip tight as they turn back along with Edward and Nancy to see
The Narissa beast grappling to hold on to the gargoyle

EXT THE CHRYSLER BUILDING CROWN - CONTINUOUS 165
Giselle’s eyes go wide in shock as she realizes

EXT THE CHRYSLER BUILDING GARGOYLE - CONTINUOUS 166

The frightened beast has REVERTED to the now all-too human Queen
Desperately clinging to the wet metal she struggles to hold on

Narissa glances imploringly up at Nathaniel begging for sympathy
with her eyes Nathaniel stares back helpless to help Suddenly
losing her grip Queen Narissa SLIPS OFF completely

PLUNGING screaming to her death

EXT THE CHRYSLER BUILDING SPIRE - CONTINUOUS 167

As Robert’s sleeve suddenly RIPS away from the sword he
frantically GRABS hold of the slippery spire with his hand

GISELLE
(panicked)
Hold on Robert

His face filled with panic as his hand starts to slip on the slick
spire FIVE fingers FOUR fingers THREE fingers TWO

ROBERT

(falling backward)
Robert TUMBLES through the dark night hands and legs FLAILING in
an uncontrolled FREE FALL over the side of the steel crown
As Robert FALLS in black space by now too scared to scream
Suddenly in the limbo of the dark night
Two strong yet FEMININE ARMS appear
CATCHING Robert with a fierce determination and PULLING HIM BACK

As we quickly DOLLY OUT to REVEAL
Giselle holding on tight to Robert as she FALLS BACK ONTO the
slippery CURVE she’s precariously balanced on

The two of them suddenly SLIDING down and OFF the curve

LANDING on a LOWER LEVEL where Giselle quickly braces her feet
against the tiny antennae to stop their fall

Robert looks at her with undisguised joy and amazement She gives
him a self-satisfied smile

GISELLE
Is this a big habit with you Falling off
stuff

Robert turns to Giselle his face filled with adoration

ROBERT

Giselle’s LOST GLASS SHOE Reaching down she picks it up the
irony of the “lone slipper” not lost on her Tears start to fall
as Nancy SINKS like a fairy tale heroine and starts to cry

PRINCE EDWARD (0S)
Why the tears beautiful lady

Nancy looks up from her tears to see Prince Edward standing above
her offering a chivalrous handkerchief She sniffles gratefully
as they start to talk their sadness quickly turning to smiles

NANCY
(holding up Giselle’s ‘shoe’)
I think Giselle forgot her shoe

Looking into each others eyes Edward and Nancy suddenly share the
same unspoken thought Without saying a word Edward takes off
one of Nancy’s own dress shoes and hesitantly slips on Giselle’s

Giselle appears in the doorway smiling Pip at her side

MORGAN
So did everyone live happily ever after

ROBERT
Well today was very happy As far as
tomorrow With a little bit of effort

Robert and Morgan look up at her happy to see her As Giselle
walks in and takes a seat with Robert on Morgan’s bed

WE DOLLY BACK OUT OF MORGAN’S WINDOW TO ROBERT’S BUILDING

As we see Pip follow Giselle in and hop on Morgan’s bed

GISELLE
Anything’s possible

The three of them laughing as we DOLLY BACK EVEN FURTHER
TILTING UP to the stars over Manhattan

The disparate constellations suddenly twisting and converging
coming together like so much magic dust to form a dancing COUPLE
gliding and spinning like a vision from a wonderful dream

FADE OUT

THE END
