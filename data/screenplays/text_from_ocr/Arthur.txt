EXT MANHATTAN - NIGHT

A HOMELESS MAN who from his tatty suit may have been a top
broker this time last year is picking through a bin in
Manhattans deserted night-time financial district

The street starts to vibrate A TERRIFYING GROWL approaches
A huge black shape smashes into view - THE DARK KNIGHTS
BATMOBILE Our audience wonder if theyve wandered into the
wrong movie The Homeless Man dives for cover

BAM The Batmobile smashes into a row of parked cars

We hear manic laughing from inside the car which screeches
and careers violently into a sign reading “WALL STREET

Sirens herald THREE POLICE CARS in hot pursuit
The Batmobile roars up Wall Street bashing against the New
York Stock Exchange thumping up and down the Federal Halls

steps and finally smashing at high speed into the rear end

the famous Charging Bull statue Two enormous bronze
testicles thud onto the Batmobiles bonnet and roll away

The cop cars screech up surrounding the Batmobile TWO
COPS and A ROOKIE surround it weapons drawn
A HELICOPTER appears blazing the Batmobile in white light

ROOKIE COP
Cooool

An older Cop flashes the rookie a dirty look then points a
FLASHLIGHT into a tiny window THE BATMAN - actually drunken
English socialite ARTHUR BACH TEMPLEMEAD in a costume -
lowers the window and offers a handshake
Batman

giggles

ARTHUR
Evening Constable

and inspired by the machine age
of the 1920s this magnificent

said The time has come to set
aside childish things

ARTHUR
Cant Hobson set them aside for me

VIVIENNE
Susan is a splendid girl Her feet
are on the ground shes of fine
stock

ARTHUR

(GETS UP)
Oh Thats what this is all about
Im not marrying Susan I dont
love her

VIVIENNE
And You think I spent my marriage
to your father skipping through
meadows

ARTHUR
Not after you ran him over in the
Bentley no Susans boring Shes
not funny

VIVIENNE
Ditto your father The aristocracy
doesnt marry for ‘fun Arthur
Its about stability Continuity

ARTHUR
and sinking your fangs into
Susans fathers bank account

VIVIENNE
The Johnson familys considerable
equity in a stormy financial period
is merely a side issue Burt is a
pillar of the community
ARTHUR
His baby formula was taken off the
market in six African countries

VIVIENNE
A completely innocent error in
places where theres precious
little for children to live for
anyway The families all got gift
baskets as compensation That
little bump in the road aside Burt
is a devout Christian

ARTHUR
Yes because theyre never insane
And where did he get Jesus

VIVIENNE

(GETTING EXASPERATED)
Burt paid his debt to society years
ago

ARTHUR
He strangled a fireman Who
strangles a fireman

VIVIENNE
Arthur

ARTHUR
Im sorry Vivienne Ive met
someone else very lovely who as
far as I know isnt related to
anyone who would kill an unsung
hero in cold blood

VIVIENNE
Un-meet her Arthur youre the end
of our line We need an heir

ARTHUR
I nearly gave you an heir

VIVIENNE
Oh give me strength A Bach-
Templemead having a child by a lap
dancer called “Mystery

ARTHUR
That was just her stage name To
give her more mystery when
shewaved her fanny around Her
real name waswhat was it again

VIVIENNE
Susan is 33 this year Her egg
inventory has dropped by 23 since
you met her You risk having no
sons or worse some pea-brained
hunchback who hugs everyone

ARTHUR
Great I like hugs And some of
them are really good at math
(heading to the door)
You know the “Frog and Toad books

VIVIENNE
No

ARTHUR
Of course you dont Hobson read
them to me while you were off
riding horses over stripey poles
Theyre about fun and friendship
not how many unspasticated tadpoles
I can squirt up a rich girl

VIVIENNE
Your father would turn in his grave

to hear this nonsense

ARTHUR
That I wont follow in his
footsteps and marry a woman I hate
I think he might climb out of the
grave and dance on it

VIVIENNE
Suit yourself

Vivienne holds up the document she was notating earlier

VIVIENNE (CONTD)
My will which I have updated to
designate Grant in reception as the
sole beneficiary

ARTHUR
You wouldnt Youre my

VIVIENNE

INT BURTS STUDY - DAY - LATER

Arthur and the butler enter the large paneled study

BUTLER
Would you care for anything while
you wait

ARTHUR
A trampoline and a selection of
woodland creatures if thats not
too much trouble

The butler leaves Arthur gazes around the room which is
filled with antique Christian iconography The ceiling fan

in the shape of a cross A large scary Jesus statue palms
outstretched stares at him from beside a fish tank
He sees a cocktail cabinet

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Ah

(TO JESUS)
Shhhhh

He opens the cabinet Nothing but bottles of water

ARTHUR (CONTD)

Bollocks

(TO JESUS)
Sorry Actually you couldnt
umyou know

(points to the water)
turn this into a nice 1990
Romanee Conti could you

He sips the water as if its wine Lifts it to Jesus

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Cheers ears

He checks out a huge very old rusty sword on the wall
Beneath it is a small information plaque

ARTHUR (CONTD)
“Genuine Sword of the First
Crusade Excavated Germany 1972

He looks around then reaches up and takes it off Its VERY
heavy and clanks to the ground slamming his foot

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Jesus Fucking Christ

(TO JESUS)
Sorry Its not like you shouted
“Arthur Fucking Bach when they
pinned you up Sorry Sore subject

Arthur lifts the sword again brandishing and twirling it
making the noise of a Star Wars light sabre

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Feel the force Luke

He swings it in a full arcCLUNK

Arthur has decapitated Jesus Wheres the head The door
opens BURT JOHNSON a large imposing man with a tiny
crucifix around his neck fills the doorway

BURT
Arthur

ARTHUR
I er had a bit of food stuck in
my teeth and couldnt find a
toothpick

Burt unperturbed takes the sword from Arthur

BURT

Heck this sword went through three
crusades Beheaded 1000 moslems
Nothing you can do to harm it

Burt walks straight past headless Jesus to the water
cabinet
Arthur looks around desperately for the head

ARTHUR
You dont um have anything
stronger do you

BURT
Sparkling

Arthur laughs nervously But Burts not joking

BURT (CONTD)
“The drunkard and the glutton shalt
come to poverty and drowsiness
shalt clothe a man with rags

ARTHUR
Surely a glass of sherry at
Christmas

Burt clinks glasses with him

BURT
Peace be with you

ARTHUR
And also with me

He sees Jesuss head Its sitting on top of one of the
blades of the ceiling fan
BURT
Arthur Can I be honest with you

ARTHUR
Youre the real Slim Shady I knew
it

BURT

My faith teaches me to hate the
sin not the sinner But with you
I struggle with that belief

Burt turns away to get a glass of water

ARTHUR
You could switch to Judaism
(glances up at the fan)
Bit warm in here Do you mind if I
put the fan on

Arthur turns the fan on a low setting It rotates slowly
the

head going around with it Burt turns away to pour more

water Arthur grabs the moment to speed up the fan again

until its going fast enough and Jesuss head falls off

Arthur catches it Arthur gets behind Burt out of sight

temporarily

BURT
Anyway Arthur However I feel
about you my daughter loves you

ARTHUR
Yes its a problem isnt it

Arthur reaches out and unseen by Burt he reaches out of
shot and puts the head back on Jesuss body

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Lets knock our heads together and
find a way to stop her loving

meGot it Well tell her Im on
the sex offenders registerNo I
am and she knows

(BEAT)

Joke sorry Ah Well say Im gay
I did once dabble actually so I
can tell a plausible story
BURT
You made love to a guy

ARTHUR
One Moslem doesnt make a mosque
Burt

BURT

You made love to a Moslem

ARTHUR
No sir it was Prince Alois of
Lichtenstein and he made love to
me The fact that it took three
bottles of poppers and a Jacuzzi
full of Krug to loosen me up
confirmed my heterosexuality

Arthur notices that Jesuss head is on backwards
Burt picks up a Bible from his desk and quotes from memory

BURT
“If there is a man who lies with a
male they shall surely be put to
death

ARTHUR
Crikey Couldnt there just be some
kind of on-the-spot fine

Burt really hammers the table this time
BURT

You will stop this talk and marry -

my - fucking

Jesuss head falls off Arthur peers around Its nowhere

ARTHUR
Oh bollocks

Both Arthur and Burt see Jesuss head at the bottom of the
fish tank It floats back up to the top

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Its a miracle He is risen

But SUSAN Burts beautiful daughter enters with her best
friend Erica - who Arthur met whilst at the restaurant the
other night

ARTHUR (CONTD)
Hi Susan Erica

Burt looks from Jesuss head to the sword figuring it out

SUSAN
Sorry to make you wait Arthur I
was talking to your mother I hear
you have something to ask me

Arthur feels Burts smiling face - and hating eyes - on him

ARTHUR
Shall we go

INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A VERY PRECISE FRENCH WAITER performs the specials menu with
ludicrous elan Susan is rapt taking it all very seriously

WAITER (0S)

the chef has bathed the bass in
a parceline of Chilean fennel and
finished him with a little gift of
kobe beef Also I have a
progressive tasting of Kumamoto
oysters en gelee which evolve on
the palate from light and
refreshing to complex and spicy A
short story with a twist at the
end Le fin

Susan chuckles approvingly knowingly the twit She coos
with delight and claps in appreciation

ARTHUR
Do you have something with less
words please The chef doesnt have
to re-cook it just scrape off the
nouns and trim out all that
gibberish in the middle

SUSAN
Hes just joshing Dominic Ill do

the skate in wood ear mushroom

WAITER
Excellent decision Sir

ARTHUR
A bowl of champagne and a spoon

The waiter leaves despising Arthur

SUSAN
Arthur did you really have to be
so icky to Dominic

ARTHUR
Im sorry I just cant handle the
whole specials act Its not a
Shakespearean soliloquy its some
heated up dead things that arent
on the main menu

A WINE WAITER slams a bowl and spoon next to Arthur He
pours
in champagne

SUSAN
You know I was grumbling to your
mother about how things are with us
sometimes How Im sure youre
trying to drive me away

Arthur slurps his champagne

ARTHUR
Um hm

SUSAN
But she was explaining that
relationships are like property
purchases invest only in high-end
stock avoid anyone up-and-
coming then hold onto the
property through thick and thin to
deliver maximum return Isnt that
darling

ARTHUR
Is it possible to buy the house but
then rent it out Sorry joke Im
not suggesting pimping you

Arthur sees a very frail rich old woman dripping in
diamonds passing by on her walking frame
ARTHUR (CONTD)
Look You after our first child is
born

SUSAN
Arthur Why cant you learn to
laugh at genuinely amusing things

ARTHUR
Such as

SUSAN
YouTube clips of babies giggling
Dane Cook

ARTHUR

me whatever you think

ARTHUR
We dont have the same sense of
humour We dont like the same
films food music You like

SUSAN
Dont they say opposites attract

ARTHUR
That depends on the opposites
Racists and the Nation of Islam

other Susan youre beautiful
Youre bright Youre fucking
loaded Is there really no one else
who could make you happy

SUSAN
No

ARTHUR

SUSAN

Well I had a thing at college
That was serious for a while But

She stops herself

ARTHUR
Daddy what Prayed to Jesus for it
not to work out then shot the
bloke behind a meat truck Because
Jesus would consider that cheating

Susan places her hand on Arthurs

SUSAN
Ask me Arthur

Arthur takes Susans hand

ARTHUR
Susan Youre the only womanat

A waiter tops up Susans wine Arthur now very drunk holds
out his champagne bowl to be refilled

SUSAN
Youre not happy Arthur Nobody
who drinks like you can be happy

ARTHUR
How do you know What if the
drunker I get the better it is for
me Not everyone who drinks is a
poet Susan Some of us drink

The waiter arrives with Susans fish and Arthurs drink

SUSAN
A real woman could stop you from

SUSAN
Ask me Arthur

Arthur sinks to his knees Susan waitsand waits Arthur

diamond - pushed onto the end of her thumb

She tries to pull her blindfold off

ARTHUR
(LAUGHING)

Arthur removes her blindfold Shes stunned to find herself

on a huge blanket under a tree in a clearing lit by numerous

candles Before them is spread the most amazing picnic of
all

time Flowers are everywhere A log fire burns in a grate

Soft music plays

ARTHUR (CONTD)
You said you wanted a picnic

He pours them glasses of 1928 Krug

NAOMI
Arthur I dont know what to say

(LOOKING AROUND)
Who did all this

ARTHUR
The picnic fairies Who liaised
with the flower fairies the candle
fairies the log fire fairies the
hidden sound system fairies

He lifts a silver platter lid to reveal a vast pizza

ARTHUR (CONTD)
and the pizza fairies

A crack of a twig from somewhere

NAOMI
Did you take account of the heroin
fairies who hang here at night

But theres nobody there A cool breeze blows Naomi
shivers
Arthur uses a remote to turn the log fire flames up

ARTHUR
Its nice to keep it simple like

restaurants All that embarrassing
crap with the specials

NAOMI
Are you kidding Where I normally
eat the specials the one that
comes with a free toy
Arthur lifts a grill lid to turn over succulent steaks

NAOMI (CONTD)
Youre rich rich arent you

ARTHUR
I get by

NAOMI
“It doesnt remotely matter how
much or what you spend it on rich

Arthur shrugs and swigs champagne pouring more

NAOMI (CONTD)
Craziest thing you ever bought

ARTHUR
I once inadvertently financed a
terrorist cell who said they needed
£100000 to open a falafel stall

She laughs She stops laughing

NAOMI
Oh my G-d youre serious

ARTHUR
Whats the craziest thing you ever
told a tour party

NAOMI
I once said the Manhattan we were
in was actually a movie set built
for “Youve got Mail but that
after the film wrapped everyone
moved to the set because there was
less crime

A sudden very loud very out-of-date ring tone Naomi takes
out a huge ancient Motorola phone

NAOMI (CONTD)
Yes dad Theres a small Tiffany
butter knife about two inches from
his hand but it might take him
eight months to dismember me with
it

(PHONE BLEEPS)

grass covered platform with a tree planted in it - which is
being lifted off the ground by a crane

NAOMI

seconds of screaming and falling
with a truffle in my mouth

ARTHUR
So anyway The tours

fill-in until Im drowned in a
tsunami of apologies from everyone
who failed to recognise my writing

Naomi finds the truffle station and hits the panic button
Down in a Crane Cab an alarm goes off The driver starts to

pay to be my friends have gone the
fog parts and theres a hole so
big you could pour all the
champagne in the world into it and
never fill it up But Ive got so
much potential a good heart Im a
good person even if Ive
completely wasted my short
precious life because I somehow
convinced myself that happiness is
a Komodo dragon a case of booze
and the memory of having once
stripped naked to Beethoven for a
coachload of German tourists who I
met outside the Rainforest Cafe

Shes done An awkward silence
