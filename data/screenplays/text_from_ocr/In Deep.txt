INSERT 1992 JUNE
INT WATERLAND EMPLOYEE LOUNGE — DAY

A small office with bamboo floors and a Tiki vibe at
WATERLAND your basic tier-2 waterslide park

Outside tweenagers belly-flop off the WATER PISTOL a
slide that cruelly shoots kids off a 20-foot drop

Inside MR CORTEZ (40s) Waterland owner and manager sits
on a folding chair dressed in Hawaiian shirt and neatly
pressed khaki pants Patient

Across from him KEVIN and CALVIN seemingly fresh out of
college Dressed in their best salesmen power suits

Kevin leans forward in his chair mid sales-pitch
vibrating like a divining rod Calvin his level-headed
sidekick

KEVIN
I’m going to ask you a question and
I’d like you to be totally honest with
me Honesty is the foundation of
everything we do isn’t that right
Calvin

CALVIN
That’s right Kevin

KEVIN
Mr Cortez my question for you is
this do you hate your business

Mr Cortez bristles at the suggestion

MR CORTEZ
Excuse me

Quickly Kevin jumps in

KEVIN
I’m not judging you either way Maybe
this place is a tax write-off for you
or you’re one of those people who hate

money
CALVIN

My brother-in-law is like that
MR CORTEZ

I’ve put every cent I have into this
waterslide park It’s my life
Calvin and Kevin exchange a glance Confused

CALVIN
Huh

KEVIN
That is surprising to hear

Now Mr Cortez is really getting worked up He’s on the
hook

MR CORTEZ
What exactly do you find so surprising
about that

KEVIN
It just doesn’t feel like you care
about your business what with the way
you’ve been neglecting newspaper
advertising all these years

This is the pitch Calvin slaps a copy of the SENTINEL a
local community newspaper down on the table

KEVIN (CONT )
I give you the power of the printed
word The most awesome power in the
world Not including nuclear

CALVIN
Studies show a moderate investment in
newspaper advertising can positively
impact ROI in less than three years

KEVIN
My gut says you double your sales in
six weeks Seven tops

Mr Cortez is tempted but he’s not taking the bait Yet

MR CORTEZ
I don’t know Radio has always been
good to us

KEVIN
Sure I love radio You know who else
loves radio 1950 You gotta get with
the times It’s not about FM Today
it’s all about discmans and hammer
pants and local newspaper

MR CORTEZ
Isn’t newspaper older than radio

CALVIN
Exactly That’s how you know it’s a
quality product Because it lasts
Mr Cortez thinks about this Gazing out the window where a
team of LIFEGUARDS carries a CRYING KID out of the water

MR CORTEZ
We do need to get some more people in
here A better crowd

KEVIN
Then you just answered your own
question

MR CORTEZ

What question

KEVIN
Where do I sign

Calvin hands a contract and a pen to Mr Cortez He
considers this

MR CORTEZ
Oh what the hell Gotta try something

He signs Kevin nods to Calvin Coffee is for closers

INT SENTINEL NEWSROOM — DAY

The heart of the newsroom buzzing with life The foyer by
the reception desk is done in expensive marble Seven
clocks on the wall set to the time zones in major cities
across the world click mercilessly forward

Kevin and Calvin enter like heroes returning from battle

KEVIN
Guess who just landed the Waterland
account

This gets the attention of the whole room Fellow Ad Reps
looking on jealously A LESSER SALES REP dressed in
parachute pants dumbfounded

LESSER SALES REP
I thought they always put their budget
into radio

KEVIN
Looks like I just made radio my bitch
‘cause we signed them to a 52 insertion
contract

Calvin holds up the Contract as evidence

CALVIN
Sorry Marconi
(off the blank reaction)
Marconi He invented the radio
MR O’CONNOR
Now that is how you get it done

From the corner office MR O’CONNOR owner of the
Sentinel An old-school newspaper man 50s Cigar chomped
between his teeth

Kevin and Calvin in awe of this man Almost like kids in
his presence which is formidable

KEVIN
Thank you Mr O’Connor

CALVIN
(trailing off nervous)
Thank you Mr Con ner

Mr O’Connor smiles Throws an arm around each of them

MR O’CONNOR
Walk with me

INT MR O’CONNOR’S OFFICE — DAY

Framed issues of the Sentinel going back almost a hundred
years Pictures of past owners of the Sentinel Mr
O’Connor’s father and grandfather

Mr O’Connor pours three glasses of Scotch from a tumbler

MR O’CONNOR
You know my grandfather started this
paper He was a tough man but he loved
this place Taught me to love it too
Scotch

He offers them their glasses

CALVIN
It’s 1030 in the morning

MR O’CONNOR
It’s the newspaper business boys Don’t
forget it

He hands them their drinks They sip dubious

KEVIN
Mmmm Very—

CAVLIN
Scotchy

MR O’CONNOR
I like you guys You don’t back down
You have that killer instinct
KEVIN
My parents made me compete relentlessly
for their love and approval Made me
the man I am today

At this MELINDA walks in Mr O’Connor’s daughter
Serious Studious She’s reviewing a ledger

MELINDA
The numbers don’t match daddy

MR O’CONNOR
What’s that

MELINDA
The withdrawals don’t match the
deposits Are you accruing your travel
expenses

MR O’CONNOR
You’ve met my daughter Melinda She got
all her mother’s brains thank God

Melinda looks up at Kevin and Calvin Actually focused on
Calvin A school girl crush Maybe

MELINDA
Hi Calvin

CALVIN
Hello Melinda

Mr O’Connor takes the ledger from Melinda

MR O’CONNOR
Let the grown-ups worry about this
stuff Why don’t you go play

MELINDA
But the numbers don’t match

MR O’CONNOR
Honey when the product is strong the
numbers will always take care of
themselves Boys—

He hands them each an envelope They look inside Two BONUS
CHECKS

CALVIN
What’s this

MR O’CONNOR
This is numbers taking care of
themselves Don’t spend it all in one
place

Mr O’Connor lights up his cigar Kevin and Calvin step out
of the office into the
SENTINEL NEWSROOM

looking at their checks 50000 each

KEVIN
Did we just become big time

CALVIN
I think maybe we did

A GOLD MERCEDES 1992 300-CLASS COVERTABLE

With Kevin at the wheel Calvin shotgun applying liberal
amounts of sunscreen to his nose and neck MC Hammer
blaring from the tapedeck Life is amazing

KEVIN
Will the good times ever end

CALVIN
I mean insofar as the Universe is
finite and will eventually burn out
then yes

KEVIN
It’s a rhetorical question Calvin And
the answer is no They will never end

INSERT PRESENT DAY ALSO JUNE
EXT MR OCONNORS BACK YARD — DAY

Sentinel employees taking in a beautiful day of sun and
pool at the annual summer BBQ hosted by Mr O’Connor It
looks like the good times have indeed never ended

Kevin and Calvin older now but their outlook on life
unchanged They walk through the BBQ chatting with co-
workers Big men on campus Kevin in shorts and flip-flops
Calvin still dressed for work suit and everything

By the BBQ Pit BOB (40s) Normal guy Unassuming He flips
burgers

KEVIN
Looking good Bob

As they keep walking they spot Ezra (30ish) sporting
designer sunglasses and a polo shirt

CALVIN
Hey Ezra
EZRA
What’s up guys

CALVIN
You get the new circulation numbers
yet

EZRA

Yup Circ up 384

CALVIN
That can’t possibly be true

Ezra shrugs Unconcerned

KEVIN
It’s a party Calvin Relax

Moving to the SWIMMING POOL where Jimmy (late 20s) lanky
tinkers with a REMOTE CONTROLLED BOAT

JIMMY
Check it I converted this baby to
diesel Totally tricked it out

KEVIN
Nice Jimmy

CALVIN
Is that safe

JIMMY
Not even a little

He sets the boat into the water and fires it up It powers
through the water ramming into a water raft on top of
which STORM the intern bakes in the sun

The boat rams the raft several times until Storm not
amused picks up the boat and flips it over

It slowly sinks

JIMMY
Oh come on

Storm goes back to her lounging

Kevin and Calvin keep walking through the crowd spotting
CLIFF (late 30s) all alone on a bench He’s pudgy
Socially off

KEVIN
Cliff you get in on any of that
avocado dip

CLIFF
No way I’m completely off vegetables
CALVIN
I think avocado is a fruit

CLIFF
I’m off fruit too My spiritual advisor
has me on this all meat diet It’s
called the Tiger Diet You basically
just eat what a tiger eats It’s been a
game changer for me

Before they can respond Mr O’Connor swings his arms
around Kevin and Calvin’s shoulders He too has aged but
he hasn’t lost his edge Cigar bit between his teeth

MR O’CONNOR
Having a good time boys
KEVIN
I’m having a fantastic time

MR O’CONNOR
Howd that meeting with the Fish
Emporium go

CALVIN
Not so great They pulled their
business

KEVIN

Short-sighted jerks

MR O’CONNOR
My grandfather used to always say there
are two things you have to remember in
life One the battle you lose today
you win tomorrow

KEVIN
Deep

CALVIN
What was two

MR O’CONNOR
Never let a hard one go to waste

MELINDA
That’s gross Dad

Melinda no longer a girl Now a woman in her early 30s
Attractive in the same way some librarians are attractive
By the book She plucks her dad’s cigar out of his lips
Tosses it away

KEVIN
Hello Mrs O’Connor
MELINDA
Okay first of all I’m not married

KEVIN
Ms O’Connor

MELINDA
Second you guys have known me since I
was a kid Melinda Please

CALVIN
Hi Melinda

MELINDA
Hello Calvin You’re very dressed up

CALVIN
Thank you

Melinda smiles at Calvin Still a flash of that schoolgirl
crush

MR O’CONNOR
Someday when I’m gone this young lady
is gonna be running the show

MELINDA
Someday I’ve been balancing the books
since I was 12

MR O’CONNOR
You and your books Why don’t you make
your father really proud and relax a
little Enjoy life

He gives her arm a squeeze then walks off Calvin smiles
at Melinda Trying to make idle chit-chat

CALVIN
Good party

KEVIN
Great party

MELINDA
Guys I don’t want to spoil a good
time but we are in trouble

KEVIN
We’re out of Diet Coke I knew we
should have doubled up on diet

CALVIN
That’s my fault

MELINDA
Not the party the paper Readership is
way down we’re losing accounts left
MELINDA (CONT )
and right It’s bad

KEVIN
Thank God for the Collectible Coin
account That’s really the gift that
keeps on giving

Melinda watching her father hand an EMPLOYEE one of his
famous “bonus” envelopes It pains her to see this

MELINDA
He’s too generous We’re losing money
and he keeps giving raises and bonuses
and commemorative watches

Kevin looks down at his own Commemorative Timex A
beautiful piece He hides it behind his back

MELINDA (CONT )
Meanwhile he’s taking on more and more
debt We don’t get some more revenue in
quickly I don’t know what will happen

Calvin and Kevin exchange a look They know what they must
do

KEVIN
Sounds like it’s time to pay Waterland
a visit Get them to up their contract

MELINDA
You think you can

CALVIN
They just got bought out by Blackpoint
so all new ownership

MELINDA
Blackpoint The chemical weapons
company

CALVIN

Chemical weapons feminine hygiene
products and amusement parks It’s a
diversified portfolio

Melinda runs the numbers through her head Wheels churning

MELINDA
If you really could get them to double
their business next year that might
buy us some time It’s a long shot but
at this point it might be the only
shot we’ve got
KEVIN
Only shots are the only shots we take

This doesn’t make much sense but sounds badass enough
Kevin and Calvin fist bump About to save the day

THE GOLD MERCEDES

No longer new Missing a hubcap MC Hammer still pumping
from the tape deck Kevin and Calvin cruising Ready for
action

INT WATERLAND EMPLOYEE LOUNGE — DAY

Kevin and Calvin ready to pitch

KEVIN

Kevin pulls out a copy of the newspaper Slaps it on Chaz’s
desk Chaz studies it Not impressed
CHAZ
Oh

KEVIN
Future of your business right here

CHAZ
The future Isn’t newspaper a media
dinosaur

KEVIN
If by dinosaur you mean amazingly cool
and loved by kids everywhere then yes

CALVIN
Readership has taken a slight dip but—

KEVIN
Think about Jurassic Park That had
dinosaurs and it was a great movie
Check that great movies because they
were all kind-of amazing

CHAZ
Look guys I don’t do sales pitches
You can’t sell bullshit to a bull if
you know what I mean Two weeks ago I
was in charge of lawn maintenance Then
Blackpoint bought this placed fired
everyone above me suddenly I’m running
the show

CALVIN
Wow

CHAZ
Wow is right I’m living the American
dream here

KEVIN
As a new manager first thing you need
to know is that the key to success is
black and white

Kevin gestures to the paper again Chaz ain’t having

CHAZ
I might not have an NBA in Business
but I do know one thing You want to
make money you have to take money

CALVIN
I’m not familiar with that expression

CHAZ
That’s why I’ve taken all our
advertising money and put it into this

it
Chaz reaches behind him and pulls out a POSTER BOARD A
Schematic of Waterland but now with a GIANT LUXURY TOWER
at the center Like a Vegas hotel

CALVIN
What is this

CHAZ
Casino luxury towers We were doing
some renovations and dug up a bunch of
Indian bones and shit Gonna try and
make this place a legit reservation
Get some blackjack Pai Gow Slides and
slots Pretty badass huh

KEVIN
So what exactly does this mean for your
newspaper advertising

CHAZ
It means fuck newspaper advertising
We’re taking this park to the next
level 20 bitches No offense

KEVIN
With all due respect an effort like
this will need significant marketing
support I’d say at minimum 104 pages

CALVIN
As a trained newspaper marketing
technician I have to concur

KEVIN
So Chaz how many pages can we put you
down for today 100 104 Give me a
number

CHAZ
I’1ll give you a number Same number as
the number of girls in my high school I
didn’t sleep with

KEVIN
104

CHAZ
Zero Now if you’l1l excuse me some
ass-wipe took a dump in the Lazy River
again Don’t walk on the grass on the

KEVIN
What the hell just happened
INT MR O’CONNOR’S OFFICE — DAY

crawling back

MELINDA
We don’t have a few months

Melinda hands Kevin and Calvin a piece of paper from the
bank FINAL NOTICE Mr O’Connor staring at the framed
photos on the wall Lost

CALVIN
What does this mean

MR O’CONNOR
It means the Sentinel is no longer a
family owned paper It belongs to the
bank Or will Soon

KEVIN
Will this affect our jobs in any way

MELINDA
Affect our jobs Kevin unless we come
up with an extra 500000 to pay off
our debts in the next two weeks the
Sentinel is finished

Kevin looks to Calvin Helpless

CALVIN
I have 724 in savings

MELINDA
That’s sweet Calvin but it’s not your
fault It’s over

KEVIN
It can’t be over Mr O’Connor this
paper is your life It’s our life

Mr O’Connor sighs Looking at a picture of himself as a
young man hoisting up a copy of the Sentinel
MR O’CONNOR

My first job was at this paper I was
eight Paper route I used to wake up
at 330 in the morning Lug that bag of
papers around God it must have weighed
100 pounds I remember getting that
first paycheck It was I don’t know
five bucks It could have been a
million That’s what it felt like
Newspaper this Newspaper it means
something to me I can’t be the only
one

(considering this)
Maybe I am the only one I don’t know
I guess I am It was a good run

And with that it’s over

INT SENTINEL OFFICES - DAY

Through the double glass doors they watch Mr O’Connor
sitting in his empty office Staring Melinda is there
trying to talk to him but he is a broken man

Jimmy approaches Watching the same scene

JIMMY
Think he’s gonna be okay

CALVIN
Doesn’t look like it

JIMMY
Do you know what the policy is on these
USB drives Can we keep them or what

Kevin and Calvin glare at him

JIMMY (CONT )
Too soon You’re right I’1l just—

He looks to the handful of USB drives he’s holding Puts a
few in his pocket

Melinda leaving her dad heads over to Kevin and Calvin

CALVIN
Are you okay
She smiles Putting on a brave face Hands them each a
stack of papers

MELINDA

Unemployment forms Be sure you fill
these out

She leaves them their forms Calvin immediately sets to
work on his Kevin can’t bare it He’s taking in the sight

CLIFF on the verge of tears packing up a series of action
figures into a box

BOB and EZRA taping up boxes of their stuff
STORM sniffing white out

It’s too much Kevin takes his UNEMPLOYMENT FORM Rips it
in half Tosses it in the trash

CALVIN
I think we’re supposed to fill those
out

KEVIN

A check from the government isn’t going
to solve our problems

CALVIN
You get more than one check

KEVIN
It’s like the saying goes “Give a man
a fish sure that’s great” If you
like fish But what if you don’t
Calvin What if you don’t

CALVIN
I like fish

KEVIN
We’re not giving up on this place
We’re going to save the Sentinel
CALVIN
We are

Jimmy comes back

JIMMY
Hey just asked Melinda and she said
the USB drives are fair game So good
news on the USB front

Kevin and Calvin ignore him Focused
INT BURGER JOINT — DAY

Kevin and Calvin munching on burgers and fries Kevin
scribbles on the back of a napkin

KEVIN

We need 500K in two weeks Simple as
that Options

CALVIN
Car wash Bake sale Cake walk

KEVIN
We need to think bigger Bolder

CALVIN
My nephew invented an App that
projects in real time how likely you
are to get attacked by bees Made some
good money

KEVIN
Too wonky We need something simple

Kevin frowns Looks to a copy of the Sentinel on the table
between them Flips it open to the center spread which is
a FULL COLOR WATERLAND AD

CAPTION 4™ OF JULY WATERLAND BONANZA
Calvin notes the ad as well

CALVIN
Great ad unit Center spread Full
color Premium positioning I guess
that’s the last one they’1ll ever run

Kevin thinks about this some more

KEVIN
What about this

CALVIN
The 4° of July Waterland Bonanza I
mean sure it’s fun but what about

parking

KEVIN
How many people show up to this every
year

CAVLIN

Tons Waterland makes 70 of their
annual profit on the 4‘ alone They
probably get close to 20000 people
KEVIN
20000 people 35 a head That’s a lot
of money

CALVIN
So what

They both look out the window On the horizon WATERLAND
towering over the landscape

KEVIN
So this is our answer
(looks to Calvin who still
doesn’t get it)

We’re going to pull off the greatest
heist in the history of human history
(pause for dramatic effect)

We’re going to rob Waterland

EXT BENCH OUTSIDE WATERLAND — DAY

Kevin and Calvin on a bench just outside the Waterland
entrance Watching as customers pour in and out

KEVIN
It’s a cash business From the front
gate to the concession stands to towel
rentals It’s perfect

CALVIN
We’re not thieves
KEVIN
It’s hardly theft when the security is

so lax

They note Chaz outside the front entrance patting down a
group of 13-year-old punks

CALVIN
It actually seems kind-of hardcore for
a waterslide park I mean did you
notice Chaz had a taser

KEVIN
But does he know how to use it

CALVIN
Why Waterland

KEVIN
Poetic justice They took down the
paper we take them down Plus it’s a
victimless crime Places like this are
always insured
CAVLIN
So we’re robbing from the insurance
company

KEVIN

No because the insurance company has
insurance too It’s an endless cycle
Like one of those Ponzi schemes But a
good one where everyone gets paid

CAVLIN
I don’t think it works that way

Kevin shrugs Stands up ready to move on

KEVIN
Come one Let’s talk to the Man

INT MR O’CONNOR’S BACKYARD — DAY

Mr O’Connor sitting poolside He looks worse for wear
Kevin and Calvin opposite him Mr O’Connor holds an unlit
cigar in one hand lollypop in the other

MR O’CONNOR
Melinda says I should have one of these
(lollypop) every time I want one of
these (cigar)

CALVIN
How’s that working

He puts both in his mouth Lights the cigar

MR O’CONNOR
Fantastic

KEVIN
So what do you think About the plan

MR O’CONNOR
What do I think What do you think I
think I think you’re two very nice
boys who have completely lost your
minds Stealing from a waterslide park
Since when are you two thieves

KEVIN
We’re in sales It’s close

MR O’CONNOR
Not close enough Robbing from a
company owned by Blackpoint You have
no idea You ever heard of Brody
Broyles

CALVIN
No

CUT TO BRODY BROYLES

A fascist looking guy in his mid 40s Military crew cut
Pummeling a HEAVY BAG at the gym Emotionless

MR O’CONNOR
He’s Blackpoint’s head of security A
real stand up guy Dick Cheney thinks
he’s an asshole Once he caught an
employee stealing office supplies know
what he did

CALVIN
Fired him

MR O’CONNOR
Poisoned him Not enough to kill him
just enough to make him shit blood for
a year

Kevin frowns Stirs his drink a bit

KEVIN
Well we can’t just let the paper die
Forget about us what about the
community Where will they read about
city council meetings and zoning
ordinances and the daily jumble Are we
even thinking about the daily jumble

MR O’CONNOR
I appreciate the passion But I’m smart
enough to know when the game is up And
trust me it is up You’re still young
Move on and let an old man rest

CALVIN
But—

MR O’CONNOR
I don’t want to hear another word about
it

He stubs out his cigar and tosses the lollypop Kevin and
Calvin take this as their cue They start to head out

MR OCONNOR (CONT )
One more thing

KEVINCALVIN
Yes
MR O’CONNOR
You keep Melinda out of this nonsense
She has enough to worry about I don’t
need her worrying about you two going
to jail as well

They look through the window where Melinda looks back at

them Deeply concerned Calvin smiles at her She tries to

smile back but can’t

nowhere a YELLOW CAR cuts violently through the pack
Reckless

Several cars spin out as the Yellow Car breaks free
crossing the finish line first

In the Yellow Car a woman with a yellow racing helmet
tinted visor It’s STORM who we have already met briefly

She pulls off the helmet and a cloud of smoke pours out A
joint between her teeth She exhales another stream of
smoke from her nose giggling

CALVIN (VO)
You think she’d be interested

As Storm steps out of the car with her official RACER TOWN
USA uniform on she looks back at the damage she’s done
Mostly tweens and young teens in wrecked cars watching
her

Behind the wreckage Racer Town USA managers irate
Running after Storm

Bob Early 40s Perfectly normal He’s holding court with
some co-workers telling a story they’re all laughing at

KEVIN (VO)
He’s just a really cool guy I think
he’d be fun to have around

CALVIN (V0O)
He is pretty cool

INT LAVA ROOM — NIGHT

Kevin nursing a beer Calvin nursing a Diet Coke It’s been
a long ass day

CALVIN
So that’s it

KEVIN
That should be it

CALVIN
You really think this could work

Kevin sets down his beer

KEVIN
You remember when we were meeting with
Pedro’s Pizza and they were talking
about walking away from their franchise
position in the Friday Entertainment
section

CALVIN
Yes

KEVIN
And you remember what I said to them

CALVIN
You said “Does this look like the kind
of guy who’s going to lose the Pedro’s
Pizza account” and then you dropped
your pants and showed them your penis

KEVIN
And you remember what they did

CALVIN
They started screaming One of them
started to cry Then they called the
police and had us banned from all

CALVIN (CONT )
Pedro’s Pizza locations Plus we lost
the account

Kevin nods This is exactly as he remembers it

KEVIN
Exactly Point being whatever happens
there’s no way I’m going to do that
again

Calvin stabs the ice in his soda with his straw Not
exactly sure what Kevin’s anecdote has to do with anything

CALVIN
I’m sorry does that mean you do think
this will work or it won’t work or

Kevin deliberately doesn’t answer Finishes his drink

KEVIN
Come on let’s get the gang together

INT KEVINS RUMPUS ROOM — NIGHT

A room adorned with pinball machines and a pool table now
serving as a table with plates of taquitos and other
munchies on it

The WHOLE GANG mingles Snacking on appetizers Not quite
sure what they’re doing here

Cliff sits in the corner alone Jimmy and Ezra load up on
taquitos Bob chats amiably with Storm

Kevin steps to the front of the room with Calvin
Addressing the group

KEVIN
Thank you all for coming I’m sure
you’re wondering why you’re here

JIMMY
Wait are these taquitos not free
CALVIN
No they are All you can eat
JIMMY
Thank God Don’t fuck with me like that
Kevin
KEVIN

I know everyone’s time is valuable so
Ill be brief we’re going to save the
Sentinel
No one is sure what to make of this

EZRA
Aren’t we a little late for that

KEVIN
We need 500000 to pay off Mr
O’Connor’s debt and buy the Sentinel
back from the bank

CALVIN
And we need it in the next 14 days
That’s how long we have until the bank
officially liquidates the paper

KEVIN
We plan on getting that money With
your help

CALVIN
Any questions

The group looks around Too many questions to even
articulate

BOB
I’m sorry you plan on coming up with
500000

CALVIN
In 14 days yes

EZRA
What are you gonna do rob a bank

KEVIN
We were thinking of a waterslide park

CALVIN
This waterslide park

Calvin hands out PROMOTIONAL BROACHURES to Waterland

JIMMY
Waterland I had my fifth grade
birthday there

KEVIN
A lot’s changed since 5‘ grade
Waterland’s now a subsidy of one of the
most vicious chemical weaponsfeminine
hygiene corporations in America And
their short-sighted advertising
decisions have cost all of us our jobs

CALVIN
And our paper
Storm for the first time engaged rolling up a joint

STORM
You know who we should rob The
politicians They have all the money
and the politics Gotta take it back
Fight the power You know

BOB
Guys I love the Sentinel Worked there
for 35 years But what the hell do you
know about robbing a waterslide park

KEVIN
I know this much We don’t do this
these commemorative watches are the
only thing we’1ll have to remember the
Sentinel by

Kevin holds out his commemorative watch
Cliff raises his hand

CLIFF
This may be a little off-topic but if
we accompany you on this quest will
there be free t-shirts

CALVIN
Huh

CLIFF
You know like team shirts Uniforms I
guess Because I know for some people
that could be a real motivating factor

KEVIN
I know we’re asking a lot If you don’t
feel this is for you understood Good
look with your job search

CALVIN
I heard the Smoke N Go is hiring
KEVIN
Part time
STORM
Do they drug test
CALVIN
They sure do
STORM

Fuck it I’m in

Storm comes up Stands beside Kevin and Calvin
Ezra and Jimmy exchange a look Then both come up Cliff
follows

CLIFF
I’ve never really considered myself a
violent person I abhor violence of
most kinds Like a Quaker or a Pilgrim
But Mr O’Connor is a great man
Possibly the greatest man our
generation has seen since John Adams
And for him I am willing to do
whatever is necessary Whether that
means stealing or killing or raping—

CALVIN
To clarify we won’t be killing or
raping anyone

KEVIN
Intentionally

All eyes on Bob the last man holding out He shrugs

BOB
Ill be honest this sounds like a
terrible idea On the other hand I’ve
got a month until my Nova Scocia
Schmooze Cruise So I guess what I’m
saying is what the hell

They’re all in

KEVIN
We start tomorrow 8 am sharp Someone
bring bagels

INT STUDY — DAY

Kevin’s study A simple room Oak desk A globe On top of
the desk an unfolded map of Waterland The kind you get
when at the entrance of the park Some bagels and lox set
up on paper plates

The whole gang huddles around

KEVIN
Boys and girls welcome to Waterland

CALVIN
43 miles of logistics hell Over 23
slides ranging from the Pipsqueak
Plunge to the Waterboarder

KEVIN
It literally recreates the sensation of
being waterboarded
Calvin circles part of the map with a yellow highlighter

CALVIN
This is what we have to navigate
through

EZRA

So what’s the plan Smash’n Grab
Pudding in the Rice Bowl Four Beavers
and a Badger

JIMMY
What the hell are you talking about

EZRA
What you’ve never robbed a waterslide
park before

CALVIN
Main safe is right here inside the Tiki
Lounge Bottom floor That’s what weve
got to hit

STORM
Break in after hours and crack the safe
open with liquid nitrogen Easy

Storm lights up her joint Mission accomplished

The group

KEVIN
Three letters for you ADT It’s only
the best security system you can buy
from a door-to-door salesman It can’t
be beat Unless you’re like you know
a professional

CAVLIN

Luckily it’s only active at night
BOB

KEVIN

We need to hit them in the middle of
the day

CALVIN
Not just any day 4° of July Busiest
waterslide day of the year

(explaining to the group)
That’s Steve The guy who sold me
these Good guy

KEVIN
Let’s be clear on one thing this will
be the most dangerous thing we’ve ever

done
CALVIN
If anyone wants to back out last
chance
No one moves
KEVIN

In that case let’s get to work

EXT WATERLAND SLIDE AREA — DAY

Kids running shoving tripping over each other to get in
line at one of several waterslides

KEVIN (VO)
Step one We’ll need to get a handle on
the day-to-day operations To know
every single detail of how this place
works Storm Cliff I want you to make
Waterland your second home

In the Lazy River floating on inner tubes Storm and
Cliff Storm in a bikini Cliff in a speedo with zink oxide
camo-style over his face A waterproof backpack
He pulls a small digital camera out of his backpack to

the 12-14 year old girls in the river This has many
parents nearby concerned

KEVIN (VO)
Next there’s tech—

INT STUDY — DAY

up just now Check out the comments

Jimmy highlights one from a poster named POOPER4LIFE

JIMMY
Hardly The page already has 56 friends

BOB
They order 25 gallons a day from Joes
Deliveries come Monday Wednesday and
Friday They’re funneled into a central
filtering system in the morning and at
night Lifeguards test for chlorination
and PH balance every hour on the hour

Kevin and Calvin exchange a look The info is detailed but
somehow not what they were expecting

KEVIN
Huh

CALVIN
Great work Bob it’s just uh—

KEVIN
Well we should have been more clear in
what we were looking for specifically

CALVIN
The thing is—

KEVIN
What we really want to know is this
would it be possible for someone maybe

you to sneak inside the park by hiding
in a vat of chlorine

They look to Bob Expectantly

BOB
Uh no That would not be possible
KEVIN
Shoot
CALVIN
I told you
KEVIN
Yeah

Kevin looks at his notepad and starts scribbling out
something Adjusting the “plan”

BOB
That wasn’t a major part of the plan
was it
Kevin and Calvin exchange a look

CALVIN
Um

KEVIN
Not major major

Kevin scribbles out more and more from his note pad Calvin
helps him out

CALVIN
Youll have to change that And that
Plus the second thing

KEVIN
It’s fine Totally cool

Kevin rips up his entire notepad and tosses it away
Smiling Bob less confident than ever in this plan

INT TIKI HUT EMPLOYEE LOUNGE — DAY

animals have sex Animal style

STORM

CLIFF
That’s absurd

STORM
You have so never been laid

Cliff almost falls off his inner tube

CLIFF
He wasn’t really specific though on
what that means You know “Life”

CALVIN

in the park without alerting security
That’s not good
KEVIN
Let’s not get lost in the numbers Stay

The car jerks to a stop Kevin and Calvin whiplashed

STORM
Woah That was awesome

We pull back to see the car has traveled about halfway down
the block away from Waterland

A trail of serpentine skid marks reveal the unnecessarily
indirect route they took to travel that block

Pretty good for my first time driving a
real car huh

She pulls out a joint and lights up Kevin and Calvin a
little worried

around and you you know shoot at
them Like a trout farm but with
animals

Calvin fidgeting uncomfortable

MELINDA
Oh

Jimmy’s voice over Calvin’s WALKIE-TALKIE cuts in

530 Like clockwork
CALVIN

Three days in a row now That’s a
pattern Other than the one day when it
came at 330

KEVIN
67 of the time it’s like clockwork
Plan is coming together

Calvin is about to respond when something distracts him
And Kevin

An absolutely STUNNING drop-dead GORGEOUS woman in a
Waterland Polo unbuttoned at the neck just enough to flash
some cleavage This is SOPHIA Late 20’s A knockout
She walks toward them running her hand up and down the
long hard shaft of a PLUNGER Approaches a DORKY LIFEGUARD
(GABE) standing nearby

SOPHIA
Gabe someone dropped a deuce in the
woman’s shower Again It’s a clogger

GABE
I’m on it

He runs off Sophia sighs then notes Kevin and Calvin
staring at her In their suits they look totally out of
place

SOPHIA
Aren’t you guys a little old to be
hanging out at a waterslide park

You’re never too old for waterslides
You work here

SOPHIA

Kevin sensing an opportunity

CALVIN
Unfortunately we have plans tonight

Grey’s Anatomy

KEVIN
Drinks sound good

SOPHIA

KEVIN
And I get off all the time

Kevin walks off confident Calvin shrugs an apology

EXT WATERLAND PARKING LOT — NIGHT

The place is starting to clear out Kevin scoping things
with the binoculars

CALVIN
I don’t think this is a good idea

KEVIN
It’s a fantastic idea We have an
inside source now

CALVIN
Don’t we want to keep a low profile

KEVIN
It’s a three-step process Charm her
Get information on the inner-workings
of the park Sleep with her

CALVIN
Third step seems a little unnecessary

KEVIN
It’s vitally necessary

INT LAVA LOUNGE — NIGHT

The kind of bar with bright blue drinks named after Sex in
the City characters Kevin Calvin and Sophia crowded
around a small table

KEVIN
So it’s not just about length it’s
also about girth That’s important to
remember

SOPHIA
Wow You sure know a lot about
newspaper ads

KEVIN
The stories I could tell you

Calvin clearly uncomfortable checking his watch
CALVIN
Well it’s getting late We should
probably—

KEVIN

So what’s it like working at
Waterland Is it fun Is security
really tight or not so tight

SOPHIA
God I do not want to talk about work
I want to have fun Right Calvin You
like fun I bet

CALVIN
Huh

She puts a cherry from her drink between her lips Works
the stem into a knot using her tongue Oozing sex appeal

KEVIN
What about finances Does everyone have
access to the books or only a few
people or—

Suddenly Sophia ducks her head down Ignoring Kevin
completely Worried about something else

SOPHIA
Shit My husband

CALVIN

Calvin looks up to spot Chaz heading to the table

CALVIN
Chaz is your husband

You know these fuckers

SOPHIA
We just met

CHAZ
Guess you guys have a lot of time to
drink now huh Cashing in those
unemployment checks

KEVIN
Right

He greets Sophia by groping her Boob Sophia accepts this
greeting with the kind of wariness women with jackass
husbands endure

SOPHIA
I need another drink

CHAZ
And you want me to buy it for you I
bet Figures You guys are lucky women
don’t go for unemployed losers This
shit is expensive

Chaz heads over to the bar

SOPHIA
He is such an asshole So jealous and
overprotective

CALVIN
We should probably leave

At the bar Chaz stares down both Kevin and Calvin Fierce

KEVIN
Yeah It is Grey’s Anatomy night

SOPHIA
No it’s fine Look Calvin if you
want you can fuck me in the bathroom

hate to label it

CHAZ

Sophia runs her foot up and down his thigh under the table
Chaz working on his second drink

SOPHIA
Looks like the ladies’ room is free

turn away from Sophia

CALVIN

INT LAVA SHACK SPORTS BAR — NIGHT

TVs playing European soccer along the walls At a round
table with several empty pitchers the whole gang
recounting the turn of events

KEVIN
It’s definitely a setback

BOB
Seems like more than a setback We’re
not talking about robbing from a
waterslide park anymore we’re talking
about going up against Blackpoint
security not to mention the FBI CIA—

CLIFF
EPA I wouldn’t be surprised if they
got involved Global warming It’s the
real deal

STORM
Why don’t we rob something else Like a
bowling alley Or Jack-in-the-Box That
place is so good

BOB
Or maybe we should do the sensible
thing and call this off

KEVIN
Since when has the newspaper business
ever been about the sensible thing

JIMMY
We’re not in the newspaper business
anymore

KEVIN

And if we don’t pull this job off we
never will be Okay maybe they know
were coming now All the more reason
to come hard As long as we’re being
safe no reason to prematurely pull
out But if you guys want to get off
and quit door is that way

No one moves but doubt is growing

EZRA
What do you think Calvin

All eyes on Calvin He knows the sensible thing is to back
off but he can’t bring himself to say it

They’1l be looking for terrorists not
thieves I say we stay the course

This is the reassurance the team needed

simplicity
Ezra squinting at the board Looking at his notes

EZRA

neutralize the entire security crew as
explained in steps 222-229

SOPHIA
(slurring)
Monkey I like you monkey

CALVIN
How are we going to do that She’s
drugged out of her mind

KEVIN

people under the influence of
barbiturates are more likely to tell
the truth

SOPHIA
You’re a hot monkey

CALVIN
I can’t believe you First you get me
involved with theft now kidnapping
Where does it end

CALVIN
Wait I am that guy This is just a
routine accidental kidnapping It’s
easily explained

MELINDA
Don’t call me again

She drives away Kevin peeks his head out of the U-Haul

KEVIN

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Sophia sitting behind a desk at an OFFICE AT WATERLAND
though things look different The office is clean and
professional Sophia dressed conservatively

SOPHIA
When I divorced my husband took over
this waterslide park bought it from
Blackpoint and converted it into
luxury condos for singles people told
me I was crazy

Through the WINDOW we see the Waterslide park now filled
with hip loft condo buildings

CALVIN
Crazy Who would say that

KEVIN
Hip urban living and waterslides The
perfect combo What’s crazy is no one
thought of this earlier

SOPHIA
Now you want me to advertise on your
little website My question is this

with e-mail blast and behavioral re-

targeting—

SOPHIA

Kevin and Calvin exchange a look Hesitate for a moment
then begin STRIPPING OFF THEIR SHIRTS
She looks at Kevin and Calvin Objectifying them with her
eyes Runs her fingers across Calvin’s pecs

Uncomfortable Calvin slides a piece of paper across the
table to her

CALVIN
Contracts

She considers this Considers them Finally she signs

SOPHIA

She stands up and leaves Kevin and Calvin look at each
other
