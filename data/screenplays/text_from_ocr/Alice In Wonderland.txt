FADE IN
EXT LONDON - 1855 - NIGHT 1

Warm light shines from the study of the gracious Kingsley
home A man silhouetted in the window speaks with ardor

INT THE STUDY - NIGHT - CONT 2

CHARLES KINGSLEY has just described his new venture to his
friends including LORD ASCOT

LORD ASCOT
Charles you have finally lost your
senses

A COLLEAGUE
This venture is impossible

CHARLES KINGSLEY
For some Gentlemen the only way to
achieve the impossible is to believe
it is possible

A COLLEAGUE
That kind of thinking could ruin you

CHARLES KINGSLEY
I’m willing to take that chance
Imagine trading posts in Rangoon
Bangkok Jakarta

He stops His nine year-old daughter ALICE stands at the
door in her nightgown clearly frightened He goes to her

CHARLES KINGSLEY (CONT’D)
The nightmare again

She nods He takes her hand and turns to his guests

CHARLES KINGSLEY (CONT’D)
I won’t be long

INT YOUNG ALICE’S BEDROOM - LATER 3
He sits on her bed listening with utmost seriousness
ALICE
I’m falling down a dark hole then I

see strange creatures

CHARLES KINGSLEY
What kind of creatures

ALICE
Well there’s a dodo bird a rabbit in
a waistcoat a smiling cat

CHARLES KINGSLEY
I didn’t know cats could smile

ALICE
Neither did I Oh and there’s a blue
caterpillar

CHARLES KINGSLEY
Blue caterpillar Hmm

ALICE
Do you think I’ve gone round the bend

He feels her forehead as if for a fever

CHARLES KINGSLEY
I’m afraid so You’re mad Bonkers
Off your head But I’1l tell you a
secretall the best people are

She smiles and leans against him
CHARLES KINGSLEY (CONT’D)

It’s only a dream Alice Nothing can

harm you there But if you get too

frightened you can always wake up

Like this
He pinches her She screams and pinches him back

CUT TO

EXT THE OUTSKIRTS OF LONDON - TEN YEARS LATER 4

A horse-drawn carriage careens down the road at a full
gallop

INT THE CARRIAGE - DAY - CONT 5

ALICE KINGSLEY is on the verge of womanhood beautiful but
slightly off-kilter She sees the world with different eyes
than other people her age Presently she’s tired and grumpy
as her mother fusses with her wild mane of blonde hair

ALICE

Must we go I doubt they’1ll notice if
we never arrive

HELEN KINGSLEY
They will notice

She re-ties her waist sash feeling for her corset

HELEN KINGSLEY (CONT’D)
Where’s your corset

She pulls back her dress to see bare legs

HELEN KINGSLEY (CONT’D)
And no stockings

ALICE
I’m against them

HELEN KINGSLEY
But you’re not properly dressed

ALICE
Who’s to say what is proper What if
it was agreed that “proper” was
wearing a codfish on your head Would
you wear it

HELEN KINGSLEY
Alice

ALICE
To me a corset is like a codfish

HELEN KINGSLEY
Please Not today

Frustrated Alice looks out the window and mutters

ALICE
Father would have laughed

She sees the hurt on her mother’s face and instantly regrets
her words

ALICE (CONTD)
I’m sorry I’m tired I didn’t sleep
well last night

Her mother pats her hand in a forgiving gesture

HELEN KINGSLEY
Did you have bad dreams again

(CONTTNURFD )
102808 Blue Revised Pages 4

ALICE
Only one It’s always the same ever
since I can remember Do you think
that’s normal Don’t most people have
different dreams

Alice’s mother removes her own jewelry and puts it on her

HELEN KINGSLEY
I don’t know There You’re
beautiful Now can you manage a
smile

EXT THE ASCOT ESTATE - THE GARDENS - DAY

The garden party is in full swing Everyone has turned out
in their summer finery Guests play croquet on the great

lawn Skiffs drift lazily on a meandering river

Alice approaches LORD and LADY ASCOT with a fixed unnatural

smile Lord Ascot is a stately aristocratic man
Ascot is red-faced with annoyance

LADY ASCOT
At last We thought you’d never
arrive Alice Hamish is waiting to
dance with you Go

She pushes Alice off and turns on Helen

LADY ASCOT (CONTD)
You do realize it’s well past four
Now everything will have to be rushed
through

HELEN KINGSLEY
I am sorry We

LADY ASCOT
Never mind

She rushes off
LORD ASCOT
Forgive my wife She’s been planning

this affair for the last twenty years

HELEN KINGSLEY
If only Charles were here

Lady

LORD ASCOT
My condolences madame I think of
your husband often He was truly a
man of vision

HELEN KINGSLEY
Thank you

LORD ASCOT
I hope you don’t think I have taken
advantage of your misfortune

HELEN KINGSLEY
Of course not I’m pleased that
youve purchased the company

LORD ASCOT
I was a fool for not investing in his
mad venture when I had the chance
She smiles

HELEN KINGSLEY
Charles thought so too

EXT THE GARDEN - A QUADRILLE 7

Alice does a line dance with HAMISH who takes after his
mother refined and immaculate with aristocratic arrogance

ALICE
Hamish do you ever tire of the
Quadrille

HAMISH
On the contrary I find it
invigorating

He struts like a peacock Alice laughs

HAMISH (CONT’D)
Do I amuse you

ALICE
No I had a sudden vision of all the
ladies in top hats and the men wearing
bonnets

He doesn’t even crack a smile

(CONTTNURFD )
102808 Blue Revised Pages 6

HAMISH
It would be best to keep your visions
to yourself When in doubt remain
silent

Alice’s smile fades Without her father she feels there’s
no one like her in the whole world They dance on Alice

sees a flock of geese overhead Distracted she bumps into
the dancers in front of them

HAMISH (CONTD)
Pardon us Miss Kingsley is
distracted today
(to Alice)
Where is your head

ALICE
I was wondering what it would be like
to fly

HAMISH

Why would you waste your time thinking
about such an impossible thing

ALICE
Why wouldn’t I My father said he
sometimes believed in six impossible
things before breakfast

She laughs at the memory Hamish looks pained He sees his
mother nearby She waves him on impatiently

HAMISH
Meet me under the gazebo in precisely
ten minutes

He goes off Suddenly two giggling girls appear in front of
Alice It’s the Chattaways

FAITH
We have a secret to tell you

ALICE
If you’re telling me then it’s not
much of a secret

FIONA
Perhaps we shouldnt

FAITH
We decided we should

FIONA
If we tell her she won’t be
surprised
FAITH

Will you be surprised

ALICE
Not if you tell me But now you’ve
brought it up you have to

FAITH
No we don’t

FIONA
In fact we wont

ALICE
I wonder if your mother knows that you
two swim naked in the Havershim’s

pond
FAITH
You wouldn’t
ALICE
Oh but I would There’s your mother

now
Alice starts to walk toward her Fiona blurts out

FIONA
Hamish is going to ask for your hand

Alice stops dead Her sister MARGARET suddenly pulls her

away
MARGARET
Youve ruined the surprise
(to Alice)

I could strangle them Everyone went
to so much effort to keep the secret

ALICE
Does everyone know

MARGARET
It’s why they’ve all come This is
your engagement party Hamish will ask
you under the gazebo When you say
“yes”

(CONTTNURFD )

102808 Blue Revised Pages 8 7
ALICE
But I don’t know if I want to marry
him
MARGARET
Who then You won’t do better than a
Lord

She looks at Hamish who blows his nose studies the contents
of his kerchief then folds it and puts it in his pocket

MARGARET
Youll soon be twenty Alice That
pretty face won’t last forever You
don’t want to end up like Aunt
Imogene

They look at their middle-aged AUNT IMOGENE with over-rouged
cheeks and a yellowing white dress that’s too young for her

MARGARET
And you don’t want to be a burden on
mother do you

ALICE
No

MARGARET
So you will marry Hamish You will be
as happy as I am with Lowell and your
life will be perfect It’s already
decided

Lady Ascot’s face suddenly looms in hers
LADY ASCOT

Alice dear shall we take a leisurely

stroll through the garden Just you

and me
She jerks her away quickly
EXT THE ROSE GARDENS 8
Lady Ascot steers her through the gardens at a fast clip

LADY ASCOT
Do you know what I’ve always dreaded

ALICE
The decline of the aristocracy

LADY ASCOT

Ugly grandchildren But you’re so
lovely You’re bound to produce
little

(she gasps)
Imbeciles The gardeners planted
white roses when I specifically asked
for red

ALICE
You could always paint the roses red

Lady Ascot looks at her strangely

LADY ASCOT
What an odd thing to say Come along

She hurries her along the path Alice hears a jingling sound
LADY ASCOT
You should know that my son has

extremely delicate digestion

Alice sees SOMETHING LARGE AND WHITE dart past

ALICE
Did you see that

LADY ASCOT
See what

ALICE

It was a rabbit I think

LADY ASCOT
Nasty things I do enjoy setting the
dogs on them Don’t dawdle

She rushes Alice toward the gazebo Alice looks for the
rabbit

LADY ASCOT (CONTD)
If you serve Hamish the wrong foods
he could get a blockage

And there it is a LARGE WHITE RABBIT in a waistcoat
standing on its hind legs and staring directly at Alice She
blinks The White Rabbit darts behind a tree

ALICE
Did you see it that time

(CONTTNURFD )
102808 Blue Revised Pages 10

LADY ASCOT

ALICE
The rabbit
LADY ASCOT

Don’t shout Pay attention Hamish
said you were easily distracted What
was I saying

ALICE
Hamish has a blockage I couldn’t be
more interested but you’1ll have to
excuse me

Alice dives into the wooded area off the path and stands for
a moment mind reeling A hand lands on her shoulder She
jumps

ALICE
Aunt Imogene I think I’m going mad
I keep seeing a rabbit in a waistcoat

IMOGENE
How very strange What kind of
waistcoat

ALICE

Brocade I think What does it
matter It’s a rabbit in a waistcoat

IMOGENE
I can’t be bothered with your fancy
rabbit now I’m waiting for my
fiance

ALICE
You have a fiance

The White Rabbit darts by

ALICE (CONTD)

IMOGENE
He’s a prince But alas he cannot
marry me unless he renounces his
throne Isn’t it tragic

ALICE

She backs away and runs into her sister’s husband LOWELL
kissing a strange woman The woman runs off

ALICE
Lowell

LOWELL
Alice We wereHattie is an old
friend

ALICE

I can see you’re very close
Lowell is bright red and highly flustered

LOWELL
You won’t mention this to your sister
will you

ALICE
I don’t know I’m confused I need
time to think

LOWELL
Think of Margaret She would never
trust me again You don’t want to
ruin her marriage do you

ALICE
Me I’m not the one

Suddenly Hamish is there annoyed

HAMISH
There you are I told you meet me
under the gazebo

EXT THE GARDEN - GAZEBO - DAY 9

He pulls her under the gazebo The shadows of the pillars
fall on her like prison bars She glances at a string
quartet discreetly positioned in the shadows bows poised
Hamish drops to his knee Alice notices an artist
immortalizing the moment

HAMISH (CONTD)

HAMISH
What is it
ALICE
You have a caterpillar on your

shoulder
He frantically brushes at his shoulder

ALICE (CONTD)
Don’t hurt it

Alice lets the CATERPILLAR crawl onto her finger then places
it gently onto a tree branch

HAMISH
You’11 want to wash that finger

He sees his mother motioning to him from below Everyone is
watching He blurts out

HAMISH (CONT’D)
Alice Kingsley will you be my wife

The question hangs in the air Unsure of herself unsure of
her future unsure of her own sanity in that moment Alice
stammers
ALICE

II-well everyone expects me

toand you’re a Lordand my face

She sees the WHITE RABBIT leaning against a pillar glaring
at her with undisguised impatience

ALICE (CONTD)
-need a moment

She turns and runs
EXT THE MEADOW - DAY - CONT 10
She follows the White Rabbit across a meadow

ALICE
Wait

She loses sight of him She peeks over the hedgerow No
rabbit Stumped she looks around

(CONTTNURFD )

102808 Blue Revised Pages 13

A white paw reaches up and grasps her by the ankle With a
quick jerk it pulls her down into the rabbit hole She
screams

DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE 11

and keeps screaming as she tumbles head over heels down
the hole She frantically grabs at the walls which are hung
with paintings ancient maps cracked mirrors demonic masks
etc She pulls out books jam jars a crystal ball a badger
claw a monkey’s hand and a human skull in her frantic effort
to stop herself And down she falls It begins to grow dark
as the day passes into night And still she falls Finally
after what seems like hours

INT THE ROUND HALL - DAY 12
WHAM She hits bottom smacking her head on a wooden floor

ALICE
Ah

Wind knocked out she gasps for air then she sits up
rubbing the bump on her forehead She’s in a round hall with
many doors She gets up and tries a door It’s locked She
tries another one and another She knocks

ALICE (CONTD)
Hello Hello Anyone there

No answer She moves around the hall Every door locked
She sees a three-legged glass table with a small key sitting
on top She picks up the key and tries it in a door It’s
too small for the lock

She tries it in a few doors too small She comes upon a
curtain and pulls it aside to reveal a little door about two
feet high

She tries the key in the door It fits She opens the
little door and bends down to look through to the other side

THROUGH THE SMALL DOOR

She sees a garden with a fountain She tries to fit through
the door but her shoulders get stuck She pulls back
Stumped she goes back to the table and replaces the key
But now there’s a bottle on the table She looks for the
person who put it there

ALICE (CONTD)
Is someone here

(CONTTNURFD )

102808 Blue Revised Pages 14
12

She looks at a label “DRINK ME” She sniffs the contents
recoils then shrugs

ALICE (CONTD)
It’s only a dream

She takes a drink shudders gags and coughs from the taste
In a moment she notices that the table is getting larger

ALICE (CONTD)
That’s curious

Alice SHRINKS to two feet high
HER POV

The doors loom above her She takes a step and trips on her
now-oversized clothes Dragging them behind she tries to
open the door But it’s still locked She groans as she
realizes what she’s done She goes back to the glass table
where she can see the gold key sitting on top

CUT TO

INT THE ROUND HALL - CONT 14
Alice attempts to climb the table leg but gets tangled in

her too-big clothes and slides off She notices a little box
under the table She looks around for the unseen person

ALICE
If this is some sort of prank I am
not amused

She opens the box It’s a cake with “EAT ME” written out in

ornate icing She considers looks up at the key high above
on the table

(CONTTNURFD )

She takes a tiny taste of the cake She takes another bite
WHOOSH She shoots upward rapidly Her clothes fit again
but she keeps growing Buttons pop seams are strained and
her skirt gets shorter The ceiling gets closerher head
grazes it She stops Relieved she bends down and picks up
the gold key Crouching she goes to the little door and
fits the key in the lock

lock opens it and steps through

EXT A GARDEN IN UNDERLAND — DAY 17

wrong Alice Wait this is my dream
I’m going to wake up now and you’1l
all disappear

She closes her eyes and pinches herself She opens them
again The animals are still there

ALICE (CONTD)
That’s curious

She pinches herself again The animals just look at her

ALICE (CONTD)
Pinching usually does the trick

The Dormouse pulls a long sharp hat pin from her scabbard

(CONTTNURFD )

102808 Blue Revised Pages 21 22

THE DORMOUSE
I could stick you if that would help

ALICE
It might actually Thank you

THE DORMOUSE
My pleasure

She stabs her in the ankle with relish Alice yelps But
instead of a small sound a THUNDEROUS ROAR is heard and the
BANDERSNATCH smashes through a high wall

TWEEDLEDEE
Bandersnatch

It has a huge furry body with the head of a rabid bulldog
Drool oozes from his squashed muzzle His fur is caked with
blood and filth His teeth are shark like and broken
stained with blood A foul stench emanates from him

Everyone scatters But they’re intercepted by RED KNIGHTS
wearing the RED QUEEN’S CREST a heart in flames The
Knights capture the fleeing animals A PIG and a FLAMINGO are
caught and thrown into a caged wagon The Dodo gets away A
Knight grabs the White Rabbit by his leg lifting him up

WHITE RABBIT
Unhand me I do not enjoy being

He’s tossed into the caged wagon with the others

The Dormouse groans She leaps onto the Bandersnatch pulls
herself up hand-over-hand to its shoulder and drives her
hatpin into its eye It bellows She tries to pull the
hatpin out but the whole eye pops out Bandersnatch howls
and whips around raking Alice’s arm with its long claws She
runs

EXT THE MUSHROOM FOREST - ON THE ORACULUM 24

A large HAND with RED BIRTHMARK reaches down and picks up the
abandoned Oraculum The grim KNAVE OF HEARTS ILOSOVIC
STAYNE has a flaming red birth mark which covers half his
face and hands He looks through the scroll and sees
something that alarms him He tucks it into his saddle bag
and rides away

EXT THE CROSSLING - DAY 25

Alice runs down the path but it diverges in two directions
A road sign points south to “SNUD” and east to “QUEAST”

TWEEDLEDUM
This way East to Queast

TWEEDLEDEE
No south to Snud

He pulls her one way Tweedledee pulls her the other There’s
an ear-slitting SCREECH The enormous JUBJUB BIRD lands in
front of them It’s part monkey-eating eagle and part
ostrich It makes a “JUB’JUB” sound as it snatches the
Tweedles in its claws and takes flight

EXT FLYING WITH THE JUBJUB BIRD 26

The JubJub flies over the barren red earth of Crims with the
Tweedles in its claws toward Salazen Grum and the castle of
the Red Queen on the shore of the Crimsen sea Her flag with
the Heart in Flames flies atop the spires

She walks the row studying the face of each frog At the
end she whirls to leer into the face of one terrified frog

RED QUEEN

She wipes a telltale bit of jam from the side of its mouth
She holds her finger up and sniffs the juice

RED QUEEN
Squimberry juice

FOOTFROG 3
I was so hungry

RED QUEEN
OFF WITH HIS HEAD

Red Knights converge on the guilty Frog
FOOTFROG 3
No Please I have little ones to
look after
The Knights drag him out The Queen turns to the Fish Butler
RED QUEEN
Go to his house and collect the little
ones I love tadpoles on toast points
almost as much as I love caviar

The Fish butler suppresses his revulsion and anger

KNAVE OF HEARTS

The Queen’s face lights up to see him She turns flirty

them The Queens horse rears The Hatter grabs the reins
and leads her to safety He looks back White Rabbit helps
others escape The March Hare looks up shocked into
paralysis The Cheshire Cat hovers near to the Hightopp clan
who stand together to protect the children But as the
Jabberwocky descends upon them the Cat disappears

The Knave picks up the fallen Sword He lifts it
victoriously and the Jabberwocky retreats

A moment later the Hatter returns to the scene face filled
with shock and horror at the place where his clan took their
stand The earth still smolders Only one burned and trampled
Hat remains He tosses his own hat away picks up the burned
one brushes the soot off and places it firmly on his head

Her NOSE falls off and lands on the Queen’s shoulder The
Hatter picks it up curiously

MAD HATTER
It smells like you’ve dropped
something

The woman feels for her nose which is still there but normal
sized She gasps grabs the fake and turns away quickly

The Hatter’s eyes narrow suspiciously He can see straps
above BIG BELLY MAN’S pants which hold his protruding belly
in place The woman turns back with her long nose

notices a large key on a chain hung around his neck The key
to the lock She reaches for it The Bandersnatch sniffs
her arm and the wound he inflicted She winces but will not
be deterred She pulls the key off

The Bandersnatch gently licks the wound His tongue is
soothing She sighs and allows him to lick the wound clean
She looks at it Miraculously the infection is gone and the
swelling is down She moves it around No pain The
Bandersnatch looks at her one eye askew

ALICE
I suppose you think this makes us even
now
Alice fits the key into the lock on the chest and opens it

Everyone has gathered just outside the castle walls They
wait nervously for Alice to make her decision

The Bandersnatch lopes out a White Knight astride him her
blonde hair hangs down the back of the shining armour She
holds the Vorpal sword high A rousing cheer rises up But
the cheer fades as they feel a shadow pass overhead

WHITE RABBIT

Red and White shall send forth their
champions to do battle on their

WHITE QUEEN
Oh ‘Racie

The Red Queen’s eyes soften to hear her childhood nick-name

WHITE QUEEN
We don’t have to fight

The Red Queen’s eyes narrow suspiciously
RED QUEEN

and I’11 melt like Mums and Daddy did

WHITE QUEEN

RED QUEEN
It’s my crown I’m the eldest
JABBERWOCKY

Behind her a dark form rises The March Hare twitches
uncontrollably

MARCH HARE

Jabberwocky’s vast wingspan darkens the clearing It swings
its reptilian head whips its pronged tail extends one
deadly claw and adjusts it’s vest

Alice can barely contain her fear

ALICE
“Sometimes I believe as many as six
impossible things before breakfast”

The right answer She smiles

Alice steps boldly into the clearing

She looks up at the huge terrifying creature The
Jabberwocky roars Alice whispers to herself her voice
trembling

ALICE
Six impossible things Count them
Alice One There’s a potion that
can make you shrink Two And a cake
that can make you grow

She draws the Vorpal Sword The Jabberwocky lowers its huge
head and hisses

JABBERWOCKY
So my old foe we meet on the
battlefield once again

Alice is shocked She hadn’t thought that it could talk

ALICE
We have never met

JABBERWOCKY
Not you insignificant bearer My
ancient enemy the Vorpal one

He strikes out suddenly with his spiked tongue Alice lifts
the Sword to defend herself and the Sword slices off the
Jabberwocky’s tongue It falls to the ground wriggling in
the dirt The Jabberwocky can only make a burbling sound

ALICE
That’s enough chatter

The Jabberwocky whips its pronged tail and knocks her to the
ground She lays for a moment catching her breath and
continuing her six impossible things

ALICE (CONTD)
Three Animals can talk

The Jabberwocky drives its spike tail down to stab her She
barely rolls out of its way in time

She pulls herself to her feet

ALICE (CONTD)
Cats can disappear

MAD HATTER

She ducks in time to avoid the creature’s snapping jaws

ALICE
Five There is a place called
Wonderland

It swipes at her with long curved claws She deflects them

ALICE (CONTD)
Six

She stands still for a moment then slowly lifts her head
All fear is gone There is nothing but fierce intention and
bloodlust in her eye

ALICE (CONTD)
And I can slay the Jabberwocky

She swings the Sword and attacks with fury The Jabberwocky
is surprised by her fierceness They do battle

gets slammed by a Red Knight Then he goes crazy throwing
things like a wild man

ON ALICE AND THE JABBERWOCKY 101

Alice leaps onto the Jabberwocky pulling herself up his
scales He twists and snaps trying to shake her off The
Vorpal Sword practically pulls itself out of her hand in its
relentless pursuit of the creature’s head Alice makes her
way to the Jabberwocky’s vest where she clings trying to
slash its neck with the sword

The vest buttons strain with Alice’s weight They
snaponetwothreeonly one left holding the vest on
by a thread Alice can barely hold onto the slashing Sword
Just as the last button gives way she propels herself into
the air

Alice imperiously

floats over to the White Queen where it gently lowers to her
head The Cheshire Cat materializes next to her

WHITE QUEEN

against Underland are worthy of death
But that is against my vows
Therefore you are banished to the
Outlands No one is to show you any
kindness or ever speak a word to you

The Hatter pulls Alice into the dance It’s a wild wacky
joyous dance and when it’s donehe kisses her at last
Chess puts a comforting arm around a disappointed Mallymkun
The White Queen leans down to the still bleeding
Jabberwocky’s neck to catch a drop of its blood into a vial

WHITE QUEEN
And blood of the Jabberwocky You have
our everlasting gratitude And for
your efforts on our behalf
The Queen hands the vial to her

must do
She drinks the potion

HAMISH
Alice

LORD ASCOT
Good Lord Are you all right

Her mother goes to her

HELEN KINGSLEY
What happened to you

ALICE
I fell down a hole and hit my head

LADY ASCOT
You look a frightful mess

Alice turns to Hamish Her adventure although unremembered
has given Alice unwavering confidence and self-awareness

ALICE

I’m sorry Hamish I can’t marry you
You’re not the right man for me And

digestion

She lifts her skirt revealing her bare legs and does a brisk
Futterwacken to the shock of some and delight of others

Why not go all the way to China It’s
vast the culture is rich and we have

LORD ASCOT

perhaps you would consider an
apprenticeship with the company
