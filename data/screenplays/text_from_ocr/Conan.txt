OVER BLACK

In the darkness we hear the solitary sound of a
HEARTBEAT resounding like a drum

NARRATOR (VO)

In between the years when the oceans
drank Atlantis and the rise of the Sons
of Aryas there was an age undreamed of
when shining kingdoms lay spread across
the world like blue mantles under the
stars Hither came Conan the Cimmerian
a thief a slayer a king born of battle

We begin to hear the muffled sounds of CLANGING swords
the guttural CRIES of combat

UNBORN BABY

Eyes closed floating at peace within the womb Suddenly
the tranquility is pierced by a flash of steel as a
sword pierces the womb its tip not an inch from the
baby’s head

As the sword is ripped out we travel with it into the
DIN of BATTLE

EXT CIMMERIA -—- MUDDY FIELD - DAY

The bloody sword rests in the hand of an AESIR WARRIOR
his own armor also streaked with crimson

Behind him a battle rages between dark-haired warriors in
pelts CIMMERIANS and blonde-haired raiders in gleaming
armor AESIR On the ground before the Aesir a
profoundly pregnant woman bleeds

ISLENE

Wild-maned and wildeyed she glares up at her enemy with
total hatred The Aesir LAUGHS

AESIR
Now now little whore Did I get you or
your little one

Lightning-fast Islene produces a short sword from
beneath her cloak and drives it into the Aesir’s groin
piercing between armored plates
ISLENE
I’d ask you the same

She leans in on the sword driving it further into the

Aesir until blood pours out his mouth and he falls dead

Islene buckling in pain places her hand upon her
swollen belly

ISLENE (CONTD)

(to her unborn child)
You cannot die before you’ve known life
You will have a name when you fall my
love

CORIN

Wielding a magnificent broadsword runes etched into its

polished surface he cuts a bloody path through his
enemies his eyes never leaving Islene

Two AESIR hurtle towards Corin battle axes at the ready

Rather than retreat Corin rushes to meet them cutting
through the first and grabbing the man’s axe which he
hurtles at the second Aesir striking him in the chest
Plumes of blood splatter as the dead Aesir drop

Corin looks over at Islene just as she slashes the
jugular of another Aesir She catches Corin’s eye and
offers the hint of a smile

But Corin doesn’t smile back-his eyes are fixed on the
forest behind her From the misty woods out rushes a

SECOND WAVE OF AESIR Islene falling right in theix path

CORIN
Islene Move

As Corin and his fellow Cimmerians race towards her
Islene turns to see

A TRIO OF WAR JAVELINS

Are through the air toward her thrown by the Aesir on
the wood’s edge

ISLENE
Spins her body away from the javelins to protect her

unborn child Her back is pin-cushioned by the javelin
shafts
CORIN (CONT’D)
Islene

As Corin races to her several of the other Cimmerians
crash into the oncoming Aesir stemming the tide

Corin along with another Cimmerian CONNOR pull Islene
away in a red trail of blood

PINE TREE
Corin rests his wife’s body against a lone tree

CORIN (CONT’D)
Well have you home in the blink of an
eye

ISLENE
No Your son will not wait

CORIN
He’1ll wait if I tell him to wait Ill
not lose you

ISLENE
How could you I will wait for you my
beloved

CORIN
No

ISLENE

Cut now husband I bear a proud heir to
your line

Corin’s eyes tear up as he rips off Islene’s cloak and
tunic then pulls out a dagger Islene steels herself
Shes silent as Corin cuts through his wifes skin then
REACHES INTO HER BELLY pulling out a bloody BABY BOY

ISLENE

The baby now cradled in her arms she shares one kiss
with her child its first taste not of mother’s milk but
of her blood

ISLENE (CONTD)
(fading)
Conan His--nameisConan

CONAN
The boy’s eyes are as deep and blue as the Eastern Sea
He is CONAN

TITLE CARD CONAN

CUT TO

EXT CIMMERIAN FOREST -— DAY

THREE CIMMERIAN BOYS run through the forest chased by a
half dozen

PICTISH SAVAGES

Swarthy and covered with war paint the Picts are armed
with dual hand axes the rotting heads of their enemies
slung at their waist

Suddenly thin trees spring up into the sky as SNARE
TRAPS grab all but one of the Picts by a leg pulling
them upside down and skyward

The boldest boy stops first to examine the struggling
Picts His BLUE EYES give him away CONAN has grown

But the one free Pict keeps coming and he HURLS ONE OF
HIS AXES at Conan Conan drops and rolls out of the way
but the axe keeps going splitting one of the Cimmerian
boy’s skull in two

The other Cimmerian boy is horrified as the Pict lets out
a guttural ROAR He backs away

Conan stands his ground staring at the dead boy

BOY
Conan We must get the warriors

But Conan simply pulls the axe from his fallen friend’s
skull He turns to face the Pict each combatant now
armed with a single hand axe
The Pict LAUGHS and CHARGES CONAN

CUT TO
CORIN
Arrives soon after with other CIMMERIAN WARRIORS Corin
stares at the Picts They are massacred Each of them

hacked and bloody ending with the Pict who charged
Conan
Conan steps forward his body covered in Pict blood

CORIN
What have you done boy

Conan nods toward the dead boy

CONAN
I followed our law

CORIN
You are not yet a warrior What do you
know of our law

CONAN
They killed one I killed five

CUT TO

INT CIMMERIAN FORGE - DAY

Conan now twelve works the bellows stoking the fire as
sparks flit about like angry fireflies Corin brings him
two lumps of raw ore

CORIN
Conan Which makes the best sword

Conan takes the two lumps testing them He hands his
father back one

CORIN (CONTD)
The stronger ore eh

He reaches into a barrel and draws out a simple sword

CORIN (CONT’D)
This was made of such an ore Strike the
anvil with it

Conan looks confused but he follows his father’s order
He strikes the anvil with the sword It SHATTERS in his
hands

CORIN (CONTD)
The strongest blade isn’t made of the
hardest steel boy The hardest ore is
Crom’s will strong and unyielding But
the softer ore is Crom’s cunning
flexible and lasting Too much of Crom’s
will and the sword will not last the
battle

(MORE )
CORIN (CONTD)
Too much of Crom’s cunning and it will
not deliver the deep cut necessary for
victory

CONAN
How do the two combine

CUT TO

Sparks fly as Corin pounds on the glowing edge of the
sword with hammer Corin nods at Conan who sprinkles the
glowing blade with ash

CORIN (V0)

A sword must be tempered its soul forged
through both fire and ice Through its
suffering it gains strength Will and
cunning become as one

Steam rises as Corin lowers the blade into a freezing
cooling vat only to place it right back into the flames

CUT TO

Corin fashions the blade’s hilt engraving the guard and
pommel It is a work of art and he hands it to Conan

CORIN (CONT’D)
A true sword is purpose It will not
break It will not fail It survives
Now--what have you learned

CONAN
How to forge a sword worthy of a warrior

Corin’s disappointment shows He takes the sword from
Conan’s hands

CORIN
This one is not ready yet

STONE CHAMBER
Below the forge lies a coffin-sized rectangular pit
several swords thrust into its stone walls to cool the

metal

Corin thrusts the stunning sword into the stone and
closes the wooden roof of the chamber with a slam

Blood rushes to Conan’s face but he says nothing
INT CIMMERIAN FORGE DAY

Conan pounds steel upon the anvil sparks flying around
him He pretends not to notice as his father enters

CORIN
The council has ruled I go south to
trade for grain at the border Connor and
Slaine join me

At first Conan holds his tongue angrily pounding the
steel But Conan strikes the steel with such force it
CRACKS splintering the blade

CORIN (CONT’D)
What have you done boy

CONAN
Nothing

CORIN
What did you say

CONAN
I do nothing Other sons have made the
journey to Brigantium I would go as
well

CORIN
Brigantium is like any other city Foul
smelling and rife with treachery Did we
not need grain no Cimmerian would set
foot there

CONAN
I would I would see the world outside
these mountains Every city would I
explore every sea would I bathe in

Corin bristles at his son’s insolence

CORIN
You are not ready That’s the end of it

Corin steps out of the hut back into the cold air

LATER

Conan lies awake in bed facing the wall He hears the
door open the wind whistling in the sound of his
father’s footsteps Conan doesn’t move feigning sleep
CU - BROADSWORD

A sword is laid to rest by Conan’s bed the same one we
saw forged earlier A moment later the wind signals
Corin’s exit again

Conan turns grasping the blade a grin crossing his
face

EXT CIMMERIA - DUSK

Corin and Conan guide a horsehitched wagon covered in
hides slowly riding down out of the snowy mountains the
giant peaks receding in the distance Two other warriors
CONNOR and SLAINE ride alongside them

EXT VALLEY - NIGHT

The Cimmerians rest their horses at an overlook the
twinkling lights of a small town BRIGANTIUM lying
below

CORIN
We make our trade and we leave Keep your
eyes at each other’s backs

INT BRIGANTIUM - NIGHT

It’s night but trading towns such as Brigantium never
sleep The street is filled with MERCHANTS haggling their
wares while TOWNSPEOPLE walk to and fro

Conan is transfixed by the barrage of sights and sounds
CORIN
We need to find the merchant Stay close

Understand Conan

Conan nods but his eyes never leave the sights around
him He begins to drift from his father’s side

A SHEMISH TRADER haggles in his staccato language to a
red-haired heavily armored VANIR

A grungy BEGGAR gets pushed aside by four SLAVES
carrying a curtained carriage on their shoulders Conan
gets a quick view of a wealthy AQUILONIAN DAME inside the
carriage her arms covered in jewels
The wealthy Dame notices Conan looking and hides her
necklace from sight

A nearby BAR door swings open a DRUNKEN CUSTOMER is
thrown out into the street right in front of Conan

VOICE Welcome Northerner Allow me to show you
some Aquilonian hospitality

A slender hand finds its way to Conan’s shoulder Conan
turns to find a beautiful COURTESAN his eyes falling to
her ample bosom

For her part her eyes fall upon the beautiful pelts
across his shoulder With a grin Conan allows her to
pull him inside the bar

INT BAR — NIGHT

A lively bar with various denizens of the town Conan
quickly finds a flagon of ale shoved into his hands as a
group of MERCENARIES sing the chorus of their fighting
hymn

The Courtesan whispers into Conan’s ears then leads him
up a flight of stairs to the second floor

As they walk up the steps a pair of THIEVES watch them
go nodding to the Courtesan

EXT BRIGANTIUM - NIGHT

Beside the gate Corin hands a GRAIN MERCHANT some gold
as the other Cimmerians finish loading a wagon with sacks
of wheat Corin looks anxious

CONNOR
Were ready

CORIN
Good We’ve been here too long already
(looking around annoyed)
Where’s Conan

Corin takes one look at the forest beyond and walks back
into the market

INT BAR — SECOND FLOOR ROOM — NIGHT

The Courtesan sprawls herself over a silk canopied bed
her veils shifting to reveal the soft white curves of her
body

COURTESAN
Your eyes look thirsty Northerner

She takes off her shirt revealing a perfect pair of
rounded breasts

COURTESAN (CONT’D)
How many of those pelts would you part
with to taste some of this

Conan’s eyes never leave her body

CONAN
I cannot They’re not mine to give

THIEF 1
That’s right boy They’re ours now

Conan turns to see the two thieves standing in the
doorway He’s confused

CONAN
You must be mistaken These are my
father’s

THIEF 1
Don’t say I didn’t give you a chance
boy

The Thief pulls a KNIFE and lunges for Conan Conan ducks
beneath the strike grabbing the thief’s arm and tossing
him clear over his head

The thief’s skull splinters one of the bedposts and
smashes into the floor

The second thief charges Conan from behind Conan grabs
the broken bedframe and swings it behind him like a bat

SLAM The thief takes the blow to the head and his
momentum sends him crashing through the window and
falling screaming to the street below

The Courtesan is shocked and terrified backing up on the
bed away from Conan Conan just drops the bedpost and
returns to gazing at her
CONAN
Continue

COURTESAN
I didn’t--I don’t know those men

It’s obvious from his expression the thought never
occurred to Conan

CONAN
Why would you

CORIN (0S)
Conan

EXT MARKET -— MORNING

Corin angrily pulls Conan down the street away from a

crowd that has gathered around the thief who fell out the

window

CORIN
Bringing you was a mistake

CONAN
She was just showing me “Aquilonian
hospitality”

CORIN
She was robbing you They judged you
simple barbarian Let them The rope that
binds men together runs thin in the
civilized world

CONAN
Civilized

CORIN
It means that one’s words need not meet
their actions
(intensely)
But inside even a liar knows what he
truly is Look in their eyes boy Their
lips may lie but their eyes never will

Corin spots the other Cimmerians and the wagon up ahead

by the gate He calms feeling the air of the forest

ahead

CORIN (CONTD)
No harm was done We head home

But in the shadows of a nearby alley watches UKAFA a
huge warrior with ebony skin marked with countless
ritualistic scars He nods to another warrior the
stocky bearded LUCIUS and they head off

INT LIBRARY - DAY

An ELDERLY SCRIBE shakes with fear staring up at a
silhouetted figure On a table before him lie hundreds of
ancient scrolls white paper flecked red with blood

The blood comes from a PILE OF BODIES dead SCRIBES who
lie nearby

ELDERLY SCRIBE
I do not understand Why do you wish to
learn of the Cimmerians

The silhouetted man leans down toward the scribe his
face catching the light He is KHALAR SINGH a fearsome
warlord with deeply tanned features and haunted eyes He
is an imposing man with the bearing somewhere between a
king and a general

KHALAR SINGH
I am looking for someone A single heir
from a bloodline hidden for age after
age

ELDERLY SCRIBE
Yes but Cimmeria There has never been
royalty amongst barbarians To think
there could be is madness-

KHALAR SINGH
Madness Now you speak of something I
know of Would like to see its face

Khalar pulls out an ornate carved box

KHALAR SINGH (CONT’D)
I was once a captain in the proud army
of Turan On the king’s command I chased
brigands into the mountains a desperate
place with a thousand caves for them to
hide in But I was very good at my job
and I soon found the cave in which they
hid Or so I thought

Khalar opens the box revealing a strange BLACK WORM its
slimy surface seems to glow fluorescent

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)
Instead we found these After the fifth
time they set upon us inhabiting our
bodies and minds the last of my men drew
their swords across their own throats
But not I I saw visions not meant for
man and I alone was strong enough to
survive Because my mind was now set on
the future A future in which I could be
king of all Hyboria

ELDERLY SCRIBE
You’re mad
(to Khalar’s men)
How can you follow him He’s mad

KHALAR SINGH
They follow me because they share my
vision Now let me share it with you

Khalar brings the puts the squirming worm into his hand
and strides over towards the fearful scribe who is then
held fast by REMO a thick-necked soldier wearing light
cavalry armor

ELDERLY SCRIBE
Wait I do not know where the Cimmerians
make their home None have ever seen what
you seek I can only tell you what I
know Cimmeria is death

KHALAR SINGH
No I am

Khalar places the worm on the scribe’s chest The Scribe
SCREAMS IN PAIN AS THE WORM BURROWS INTO HIS SKIN
EXPLORING HIS TORSO AND THEN FINALLY INVADING HIS HEAD

HIS EYES TURN AS BLACK AS NIGHT AND THE SCREAMING STOPS

EXT LIBRARY — DAY

Khalar walks out into an alleyway outside the library
looking displeased He’s met by Ukafa who comes striding
up with Lucius

KHALAR SINGH
Only good news Ukafa

UKAFA
The best my lord Cimmerians

KHALAR SINGH
Here

UKAPA
They just rode out bearing wheat

Khalar’s adept mind quickly surmises the situation
KHALAR SINGH
The long winter must have depleted their
food stores Their misfortune dispels
ours

He stares off into the shadows of the alleyway

KHALAR SINGH (CONT’D)
Track them

We think he is speaking to no one But suddenly--

THE SHADOWS MOVE

SHADOW SCOUTS

Harkening from the deepest jungles of Kush the
tribesmen’s shifting skin serves as camouflage
seamlessly blending them into any background Only their
EYES betray their position almond spheres that appear to
float bodiless

The four SHADOW SCOUTS depart barely detectable as they
disappear down the alleyway

CUT TO

EXT MOUNTAIN PASS -— DAY

The Cimmerians pull the wagon laden with wheat through
the heavily forested pass

Conan stops a moment turning to look behind

CORIN
Conan pull

Conan throws his shoulder into the effort but behind
them unseen shadows shift and move

CUT TO

EXT CIMMERIAN VILLAGE — DAY

The entire Cimmerian village helps unload the precious
bales of wheat Conan and his father share a rare smile
content with their successful journey

Corin looks up and suddenly his expression changes
Corin’s face grows cold his hand falling to his sword

Conan turns to see a LONE HORSEMAN in silhouette atop
the ridge behind them The horse is black as night and
covered in battle armor

The Cimmerian warriors instinctively shift into defensive
positions as the horseman slowly guides his horse down
the snow-covered hill

Corin turns to his son

CORIN
Protect the wheat Pull the wagon to the
far side of the village

CONAN
Its but one man father

Corin glares at his son and Conan pulls the wagon away
As the rider nears we finally see his face It is Khalar
Singh

KHALAR SINGH
So this what a legendary Cimmerian
village looks like I must confess I
expected more Then again they also said
you could never be tracked

Not one of the Cimmerians respond

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)
Who speaks for you Cimmerians

CORIN
Each man is free here We have no ruler

KHALAR SINGH

Then I address each free man I am here
out of respect One warrior to another I
have heard tales of the fierce Cimmerian
heart of your barbarism and your
courage I wish you no more harm than is
necessary And so I ask you to grant me
that which I came for without bloodshed

CORIN
Any who tread in this valley ask for but
one thing a swift end

A CHEER goes up among the Cimmerians

CORIN (CONT’D)
Is that what you came for noble

KHALAR SINGH
No I came for your women

The barbarians LAUGH This guy is unbelievable Khalar
Singh doesn’t crack a smile Dead serious

Conan stares at the stranger from behind the wagon
curious and wary

KHALAR SINGH (CONT’D)
One from each bloodline The rest may
stay with you It may seem harsh but I
assure you it is as merciful as this day
will ever be

Corin steps forward raising his sword at Khalar Singh

CORIN
Keep your mercy outlander It falls on
deaf ears

The Cimmerians laugh So does Khalar Singh supremely
unconcerned He pulls out a RAM’S HORN its blasts
echoing in the valley

And in response KHALAR’S LEGION appears TWO HUNDRED
WARRIORS from every far-flung corner of the world ring
the ridges surrounding the village on all sides

KHALAR SINGH
Yours is not the first tribe of warriors
I’ve faced The strong who survived
joined my ranks Reconsider my offer
Cimmerian You are outnumbered

Corin WHISTLES From every hut WOLVES appear sharp
teeth bared There appears to be a wolf for each of the
fifty Cimmerian warriors

CORIN
We will take our chances

Khalar SHOUTS and spurs his horse onward right at Connor
and Slaine who stand closest to the opposing General
The two barbarians rush to meet him head on

Khalar parries both their attacks with his dual blades
then spears both of them through the throat Khalar then
LIFTS BOTH MEN OFF THE GROUND throwing them aside like
rag dolls Even the stoic Cimmerians are cowed by the
display of superhuman power

Khalar’s men shout a BATTLE CRY and charge down the steep
hills The two forces COLLIDE in a tangle of steel and
flesh bare-chested Cimmerians against armored soldiers

The Wolves add to the havoc launching themselves at the
invaders and knocking them down for the Cimmerians to
finish off

Corin proves the most lethal of the Cimmerians felling
Khalar’s warriors with single swipes of his great blade

Little by little the fearsome warriors of Khalar Singh
fall to the frenzied Cimmerians and their wolves

Until Khalar Singh blows upon the horn again
ATOP THE RIDGE

BLACK ROBED PRIESTS begin to CHANT They raise burning
BRAZIERS leaking a soft grey smoke that changes to a
thick and dark black

THE VILLAGE

The wolves are the first to react prostrating themselves
to the earth tails ducked between their legs They begin
to howl a haunting CATERWAUL that turns into YELPS OF
PAIN as they begin to change--

Their bodies begin to morph nature twisted by the
ancient magic The skin beneath their fur bubbles like a
cauldron their bones splinter crack and reform
Finally the fur tears open a demonic beast forcing its
way out from inside the dogs

THE JACKAL BEASTS

Each of the half dozen were-creatures is a monstrosity
black fur punctuated by rows of pointed exposed bone
down the ridge of their hulking backs Their squat faces
are dominated by enormous jaws lined with razor sharp
incisors Their blood red eyes reveal the madness of
eternal pain

THE CIMMERIANS

The Jackal Beasts quickly turn upon the Cimmerians One
of the Jackals leaps onto its prey jaws ripping into
exposed flesh tearing the face right off a Cimmerian

Another Cimmerian manages to get his entire sword into
the chest of a leaping Jackal but the beast simply keeps
coming its jaws bearing down upon the warrior’s jugular
Blood erupts as the Jackal rips off the Cimmerian’s head
then tears into the headless torso devouring the raw
flesh

Against the inhuman furor of the arcane beasts even the
Cimmerians prove no match The tide of the battle shifts

CORIN

Corin spies Khalar Singh across the fray slicing
through the weakened Cimmerians Corin rushes Khalar but
the horseman has the advantage

Khalar quickly parries the initial attack and counters
with his second blade Corin dodges the swing but Khalar
Singh uses his warhorse to bear down upon Corin Corin
stumbles back

Khalar presses his advantage Corin parries three swift
sword blows in a row but the fourth slashes deeply
across his chest and he drops to the muddy ground
Khalar Singh raises his sword for the coup de grace
CONAN

Conan appears sword in hand YELLING in fear and rage
He dives underneath Khalar’s horse thrusting his sword

into its belly

The warhorse collapses taking Khalar Singh down with it
Khalar Singh is pinned

KHALAR SINGH
Kill them all Take the women

Conan eyes filled with fury heads towards Khalar

CORIN
Conan Hold

But Conan only has eyes for his prey Corin pulls his son
down just as a Jackal Beast leaps at him With a sweep of
his blade Corin lops the head off the beast

Corin though mortally injured then pulls a reluctant
Conan from the battle back towards their hut

Conan stares at his father who bleeds profusely

CONAN
Let me go father We must fight

But when Corin looks around it’s clear the Cimmerians
have lost Only a handful still fight on to the end

CORIN
(struggling)
Since before you were born--your mother
knew a great destiny awaited you I held
you back from that---for too long You
wanted to be a warrior of the tribe
Conan--now you must be its last

CONAN
Father I am not afraid to die

CORIN
Good Make your death have purpose

Corin surprises Conan clubbing him across the head with
the butt of his knife

FADE TO BLACK

INT STONE CHAMBER -— DAY

Conan comes to in the icy cold of the stone chamber
beneath his father’s forge There is nothing but silence
all around

Conan tries to push the wooden enclosure above him aside
but a pile of swords lie atop it He heaves away and
manages to escape the tiny cold coffin

EXT CIMMERIAN VILLAGE DAY

Conan exits his father’s forge only to see the entire
village burning The bodies of everyone he has ever known

litter the landscape Nothing stirs

Conan falls to the icy ground tears falling from his
eyes

CORIN

Corin’s dead body lies propped up by three spears his
own sword thrust deep into his chest

CONAN

Stares at his father Jaws clenched Conan pulls the
sword out of his father’s body

cuUT TO
A PYRE

A pile of Cimmerian bodies lies atop the pyre Conan
carefully lowers Corin into the pyre as well

CONAN
I swear to you all However long it
takes I will be your vengeance

Conan lights the pyre the flames quickly engulfing the
bodies

DISSOLVE TO

INT BAR - MESSANTIA — NIGHT

A raucous bar on the Argossean waterfront looking over a
port lined with Shemish galleys and junks from Kush

The bar is filled with the hearty sailors and merchants
of those ships and those who desire to part them from
their hard-earned money Zamoran thieves Hyborean
mercenaries and Brythunian whores

A pair of CITY GUARDS short swords sheathed at their
sides enter the bar and are immediately summoned over by
the harried BARKEEP

BARKEEP
He’s over there towards the back

CITY GUARD 1
What’s this one done

BARKEEP
What’s he done What hasn’t he done
He’s bedded six of my whores and finished
off three casks of mead-and he hasn’t
‘paid so much as a silver piece for it
And when I tried to collect he broke my
man’s arm

Six men hold down a HULKING MAN as another bartender
SNAPS his ham-hock of an arm until it faces back in the
right direction

CITY GUARD 2
Sounds like a real problem Too bad we
have other places to be right now

The Barkeep shakes his head knowing the routine He
slips a pair of silver pieces into the soldier’s hand

BARKEEP
Just get that behemoth out of here

The two City Guards make their way to the back of the
bar His back to them the drunken man theyre after has
himself propped up between a pair of voluptuous topless
WHORES

As the soldiers arrive the man throws his tankard of ale
at the Barkeep who’s now back behind the bar

DRUNKEN MAN
Piss-water You’1l serve my friends and I
your best barman or youll taste my
steel

CITY GUARD 1
Time to leave northerner

The Drunken Man turns as the City Guard puts a hand on
his shoulder

CONAN

The gangly fifteen year old boy has grown into a
powerfully built man broad-shouldered with sun browned
skin lined with battle scars Only the piercing blue eyes
and square cut black mane remain from the boy we last
saw

Conan stands to his full height looming over the smaller
City Guards who instinctively take a step back

CONAN
No my small friends It’s time to die
Now-——
Conan HICCUPS barely able to stand

CONAN (CONT’D)
Who’s--first

His eyes roll up in his head as he collapses to the
ground

CUT TO

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Conan unconscious is being dragged down the street by
the two City Guards

CITY GUARD 1
(struggling)
By the gods he’s as heavy as a horse

CITY GUARD 2
Even a dead horse smells better than
this

EXT PRISON TOWER - NIGHT

A portcullis raises to give the City Guards dragging
Conan passage inside

INT PRISON - NIGHT

The two City Guards drag Conan into the town’s prison
where a LIEUTENANT sits eating his dinner

The Lieutenant doesn’t even bother to look up from his
meal

LIEUTENANT
What’s the charge

CITY GUARD 2
Public drunkenness Another damn hill ape
who can’t handle his liquor

LIEUTENANT
Is that so boy How do you plead

Conan yawns in response One of the City Guards slaps
Conan hard across the face Conan slowly opens his
eyes

CONAN
Where’s the Captain of the Guard

LIEUTENANT
In the cells interrogating a prisoner
And youll get the same if you don’t
answer Youre accused of public
drunkenness How do you plead

Suddenly Conan shifts upright looking way more sober
than he did a moment ago

CONAN
Haven’t had a drop all night

The guards holding Conan up by his arms suddenly find
those arms wrapped around their heads Twist twist
SNAP SNAP He breaks both their necks in an instant

The Lieutenant is horrified He goes for his sword Conan
bats it out of his hand slamming the Lieutenant’s head
against the back wall

CONAN (CONT’D)
The key to the cells

LIEUTENANT
I don’t have it There’s a guard inside
the door Only he can open it
Conan picks up the Lieutenant’s sword
LIEUTENANT (CONTD)
You can’t kill me He’1ll only open the
door for me

A FLASH OF STEEL as Conan delivers a blow

CUT TO

INT CELLS - NIGHT

A GUARD sits on a stool next to a heavy metal door
Behind him the CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD beats a chained
prisoner to a pulpy mess

There’s a KNOCK at the door

GUARD 1
What is it

MUFFLED VOICE (0S)
Need to see the Captain

The Guard exhales frustrated He stands up getting his
keys out He stops Opens the small EYEHOLE to see into
the other room

The Lieutenant stares back at him

GUARD 1
Fine fine

He opens the door--

Only to see Conan standing there holding the decapitated
head of the Lieutenant

The shocked Guard goes for his sword Conan swings the
Lieutenant’s head smashing it into the Guard’s jaw and
putting him down for the count

That’s when the Captain of the Guard turns around And WE
RECOGNIZE HIM He’s LUCIUS and he was one of Khalar
Singh’s soldiers

LUCIUS
Men

From around a corner come five more Guards drawing their
weapons Lucius draws his as well

LUCIUS (CONT’D)
Youve made a huge mistake ape The exit
is the other way

CONAN
I came for you Lucius

Lucius nods to the guards who advance on Conan

LUCIUS
You talk as though you know me ape

CONAN
I do And I am no ape I am Cimmerian

As recognition crosses Lucius’ face Conan springs into
action He KICKS the table at the men sending the knives -
and other torture implements flying right into the first
guard

The second guard tries leaping over the falling table
Conan just grabs him in midair and throws him even faster
into the iron bands of the prisoner cells

Lucius lunges at Conan Conan steps in on him grabbing
his sword hand In a show of strength he twists Lucius’
own sword until points down at the floor then THRUSTS IT
THROUGH LUCIUS’ FOOT AND DEEP INTO THE WOOD FLOOR BELOW

Lucius BELLOWS in pain pinned to the spot

The next three Guards rush forward forcing Conan to deal
with three weapons attacks at once

The first to strike swings a mace and chain that wraps
around Conan’s sword and he tries to yank it free from
Conan’s grip Instead Conan pulls him in a wide circle
sending him flying into a wall-mounted torch The guard
burns like dry kindling

The second to strike hits Conan on his sword hand
carving a deep gash and causing him to drop his sword

Conan turns to face him eyes filled with rage The
guard’s face goes pale Conan head butts him with all his
might and the guard goes down bleeding from mouth nose
and ears

However the last Guard is upon Conan before he can
react The powerful soldier uses the shaft of his poleax
to lift Conan off his feet and back against the far wall
pinned by the neck

Conan struggles to breathe the polearm shaft driving his
throat into the wall The thickness of the Cimmerian’s
neck gives him time to reach into his bracer pulling out
a hidden knife which he buries into the Guardsman’s eye

cuUT TO

Lucius SCREAMS in pain as Conan pours water on the
burning guard and lifts the table back onto its legs
Then he pulls the sword out of the floor a thick plume
of blood rising out of Lucius’ now liberated foot

Conan takes Lucius’ face and smashes it against the
table Lucius looks aghast as Conan takes his injured
hand and places it over the torch flame searing the
wound closed The Cimmerian never even bats an eye

LUCIUS
Who are you What do you want

CONAN
You know who I am

Conan unfurls a piece of parchment beside Lucius’ face

PARCHMENT

The weathered parchment has crude drawings of FACES
several of them with red ”“X” marks through them Conan
points to one of the drawings very clearly the image of
Lucius

CONAN (CONT’D)
Tell me where to find the others and
I‘ll make your death a quick one

LUCIUS
That You think that is me You’re
wrong

Conan lifts the sword bracing Lucius’ head for the blow

LUCIUS (CONT’D)

Wait Wait

(Conan pauses)
I can tell you where the rest are There
are four faces unmarked Me Khalar
Singh The tall dark one is Ukafa Khalar
Singh’s most trusted The one with the
scar is Remo He commands Khalar Singh’s
cavalry If I tell you where to find
them would you agree not to kill me

CONAN
Why would I do that

LUCIUS
Because Khalar Singh can only be found by
those he wishes to find him You could
waste ten more years searching only to
lose his trail

Conan thinks about it

CONAN
You have my word You tell me where I
will find Khalar Singh and I will not
kill you

Conan lets Lucius go He hobbles to his chair

LUCIUS
He is far from this place Past the
Mountains of Fire on the edge of the Red
Waste in a land called Khoraja

CONAN
Convenient that you would send me to the
far side of the world

LUCIUS
Its no mistake you find me this far from
Khalar He has gone mad His obsession
with the dark arts is a curse and
Khoraja is home to the cursed I swear to
you I have no reason to lie I will
thank you to kill him Perhaps then my
nightmares will cease

In a flash Conan grabs Lucius’ head again yanking it
back exposing his throat

LUCIUS (CONTD)
You gave your word

Conan rips a SMALL KEY from a large keyring He drops it
in Lucius’ throat The big man chokes instantly A second
later Conan pours ale from a flagon down his throat as
well

Lucius swallows the key gasping for breath as Conan
releases him

LUCIUS (CONT’D)
What are you doing

CONAN
Toasting to our deal

Conan grabs the large prison keys and heads over to the
prison cells opening them Several PRISONERS amble out
a haggard and angry looking bunch

CONAN (CONTD)
Go You are free

HUGE PRISONER
What of our chains

Conan hands the PRISONER the fallen Guardsmen’s sword

CONAN
The key to your chains sits in the
Captain’s gut Happy hunting

The Huge Prisoner grins with malice As the Prisoners
close in on the terrified Lucius Conan heads for the
door

LUCIUS
Barbarian I had your word You said you
would spare my life

CONAN
No I said I wouldn’t kill you

We hear Lucius SCREAMS OF PAIN as Conan walks out into
the night crossing Lucius’ face off his list of targets

Staring up at him the drawn face of Khalar Singh

EXT DESERT SANDSTORM — DAY

KHALAR SINGH looks older Worn He squints as he stares
into a raging sandstorm The sand is blood red The wind
howls in his ears There is something else in the wind
It sounds like frightened whispers

UKAFA trudges through the deep sand to reach him The
sandstorm is so blinding we don’t see him until he is
less than five feet away

UKAFA
Khalar Singh we’ve lost half our cavalry
legion We must turn back

KHALAR SINGH
We press on

UKAFA
My Lord we’ve been deceived There is
nothing here

KHALAR SINGH
You see only with your eyes We follow no
rumor this time No fable After scouring
all of Hyboria the Heir is here before
me

He looks in Ukafa’s doubt-filled eyes then pushes him
back to the sand and trudges forth disappearing into the
storm

Ukafa finally steps forward into a sandstorm that only
seems to get more violent--

UNTIL SUDDENLY THE STORM STOPS

EXT OASIS - CONTINUOUS

An incredible sight The desert drops nearly a hundred
feet into a protected rock oasis replete with deep blue
pools of water amongst a monastery and several thatched-
roof adobe houses

And moving between the pools are MEN and WOMEN going
about their simple chores They wear long flowing robes
and turbans the men’s red and the women’s white

The air and sand are perfectly still within the perimeter
of the oasis But beyond it the sandstorm rages all
around sand hurled violently hundreds of feet into the
air swirling around the oasis as though it were the eye
of some mystical hurricane protected by an unseen force

KHALAR SINGH
Gather the troops Then search for
tunnels On all sides

UKAFA
It will be done Khalar Singh

KHALAR SINGH
Ukafa The women wear white None must
escape None Spread the word

EXT OASIS -— DUSK

Two MALE MONKS draw water from a pool Nearby a FEMALE
MONK chops vegetables for the night’s meal

One of the monks drops his bucket in the calm water But
then in the pool’s reflection he sees EYES SHIMMERING
over his shoulder

The monk quickly reaches for his blade but the
shimmering SHADOW SCOUT moves first slicing BOTH MONKS’
THROATS BEFORE EITHER CAN UTTER A SOUND

Another SHADOW SCOUT quickly grabs the female monk its
inky black hand covering her mouth--

But she also holds a knife and in an instant stabs
blindly at her assailant The Scout SHRIEKS as she
connects his skin reverting to its natural aboriginal
color as he falls dead

It gives her just a moment to react She SCREAMS

FEMALE MONK
Invaders

From the storm above we hear an inhuman BELLOW
WAR MAMMOTHS

A dozen of the towering beasts bellow as they emerge from
the storm racing down the sandy hills from all
directions Their tusks are pierced with iron chains with
spiked balls at their end The mammoths swing their
tusks pulverizing the first wave of monks who meet the
attack

Carriages are affixed to the mammoths’ lumbering backs
on which KUSH SPEARMEN rain down javelins upon the
oasis’s defenders

Armed MONKS come streaming out of the buildings joining
the fray

However there’s a WHOOSHING sound overhead as FLAMING
ARROWS race out of the storm falling on the thatched
roofs and many of the monks below

Every structure begins to burn One of the huts even
EXPLODES

INT MONASTERY - CELL DAY

Perfect blue eyes fly open TAMARA awakens from a
bad dream She listens but hears nothing but her own
ragged breathing

INT MONASTERY - MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS

Seated at a table at the far end of the hall is FASSIR the elder monk and scholar of the monastery Tamara
hurries to him

TAMARA
Passir someone comes

The two monks with Fassir JASIM and SIMURA exchange glances “Not again” glances

FASSIR
Another dream my dear

TAMARA
Yes--no--I do not know but it feels
different than the others

FASSIR
Tamara you know what to do I have
taught you countless times You must turn
away from such visions By embracing them
you only give them power

TAMARA
But he was so real And he was coming for
me
An eyebrow raises
FASSIR
For you
TAMARA

With a legion of soldiers They called
him--Khalar

Suddenly the monastery’s BELL RINGS OUT It’s followed
by sounds of commotion outside then the EXPLOSION

A younger monk BAEL races in

BAEL
An army attacks from all sides at once

FASSIR
(dazed)
He has finally found us

TAMARA
So they are more than dreams Who is this
Khalar Why does he want me

FASSIR
I’m sorry child We kept so much from
you thinking it would save you--

AN EXPLOSION RIPS APART THE FAR WALL OF THE MONASTERY
Black smoke pours in

FASSIR (CONTD)
Simura Jasim get her away She must not
be captured

Tamara is confused and scared as Simura and Jasim grab
her and hurry her out of the monastery

As the two men lead Tamara away Fassir turns to Bael

FASSIR (CONT’D)
Burn ali the scrolls Bael Nothing must
fall into Khalar’s hands

Bael bows

BAEL
At the cost of my life teacher it will
be done

EXT OASTS CONTINUOUS

The lopsided battle has made its way to the front of the
monastery The massive war mammoths corral the remaining
monks mostly women before the three story building

ARMED HORSEMEN

Hyrkanian horsemen led by Remo race past the mammoths
They target the women in the white robes lashing out
with whips that entangle and bind them but do not kill

The monks fight with ferocity and their own mix of
martial arts and swordplay but their forces quickly
become overwhelmed by their attackers’ larger numbers

But the monks buy enough time for Tamara to be led to a
spare horse trailed by Fassir and guarded by Simura and
Jasim

On the run Tamara takes in the battle with horror
watching as her people are cut down

TAMARA
Wait--we can’t just leave them

Simura and Jasim push Tamara towards her horse when
suddenly a flaming hut nearby EXPLODES raining fire
between them and Fassir The battle quickly surrounds
Fassir

TAMARA (CONT’D)
Not Fassir

Simura and Jasim leap upon their horses pulling Tamara’s
along beside them

SIMURA
There’s no time We must go

As they ride off Tamara looks back at Fassir who
reaches out to her

FASSIR
Tamara

But it’s too late as the riders disappear through the
smoke of the battle

INT NORTH TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

A stone and sand tunnel wide and smooth that extends
beneath the desert itself A massive WAR MAMMOTH blocks
the entrance Kush Spearmen atop its back

Tamara and her warriors gallop towards it Simura and
Jasim taking the lead The fearless monkwarriors evade
the enemy spears riding right up to the mammoth’s head

They rear back on their horses reigns and as the raised
horses’ hooves near the mammoth’s head the great beast
bellows and rears back

The spearmen topple off the mammoth’s back and Tamara and
her two warriors gallop past them into the tunnel

EXT OASIS - CONTINUOUS

Khalar atop his horse at the lip of the oasis spots
Tamara and her two warriors far off escaping out the
north tunnel

TAMARA

Stops her horse just before the maelstrom still inside

the safe haven of the oasis She looks up and locks eyes
with Khalar An anger rises within her a stark contrast
from the innocent young monk she seems to be

TAMARA
(to the distant Khalar)
You will pay
cU — TAMARA’S EYES

A ringing SOUND is heard and the air around Tamara seems
to SHIMMER as if a wave of heat blew past through

KHALAR SINGH

Suddenly Khalar’s horse gets spooked and REARS Khalar
is shocked unprepared and he falls over backwards--

RIGHT TOWARD HIS OWN SWORD WHICH HAS FALLEN AND IS
JUTTING OUT OF THE SAND At the last moment Khalar
twists his body out of the way and the sword simply
scratches his neck

He stares in shock and awe at
TAMARA

She blinks snapping out of her trance as Simura grabs
her arm

SIMURA
Come He’‘ll send his best trackers Jasim
and I will draw them off
KHALAR SINGH

The general can only watch as Tamara and the others
disappear into the raging storm He wipes the blood from
his neck shaking off the strange experience

Khalar motions to Remo who immediately rides up

KHALAR SINGH
Remo Find her

Remo uses hand motions to gather his cavalry around him
They SHOUT as they kick their horses into a gallop

CUT TO

EXT VILLAGE - KHORAJA - DAY

Conan walks into a small village in peril CAVALRYMEN put
huts to the torch and drag peasants into the street to be
slaughtered

PEASANT FATHER
I’ve seen no girl None On the life of
my family I swear it

The cavalryman cuts him down with one blow of his sword
Then he moves to the next peasant lying in the mud

Conan never pauses He simply continues walking right
through the center of the mayhem

CAVALRYMAN
You

Conan keeps walking until the cavalryman puts his horse
in front of Conan’s path Only Conan’s eyes rise to meet
the man

CAVALRYMAN (CONT’D)
We seek a girl with dark hair wearing
monk’s robes Have you seen such a girl

CONAN
No

The cavalryman stares at Conan a long moment deciding
whether to press the question He makes a smart choice
and backs his horse out of Conan’s path

Conan continues on oblivious to the screams and cries of
the villagers

CAVALRYMAN
(to the other cavalry)
They’ve seen nothing here Leave the rest
and report back to Remo

At the word “Remo” Conan’s feet stop walking Slowly
casually he draws his sword He keeps his back to the
cavalry

CONAN
Are you Remo’s men

The cavalrymen stop taking note of Conan standing still

CAVALRYMAN
What concern is it of yours

Conan smiles inhaling deeply When he exhales his eyes
are full of battle fury

CUT TO

EXT FIELD ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

A cavalry encampment Circular white tents with horses
tied up at every tree We hear LAUGHING from one tent
then Remo comes falling out of it

REMO
A hellion to be sure No wonder she was
so hard to capture

SOLDIER 1
Sir Khalar Singh’s orders--

REMO
Khalar Singh wants her unharmed What I
wish for her could hardly be called harm

Just then EIGHT HORSEMEN approach slowly two abreast
We recognize them as the soldiers we just saw at the
village

REMO (CONTD)
What were you doing for so long I found
the girl in half the time it took you to
come back empty handed We were going to
send out a search--party

Suddenly the Remo notices something is not right
The first two horsemen are tied onto their saddles and
they sit upright because swords are driven into their

backs to keep them so

REMO (CONT’D)
Demons of Set

Remo and the Soldier check all the horses Each rider is
the same-

EXCEPT FOR THE LAST The ropes fall away from his body as
CONAN DRIVES HIS SWORD THROUGH THE SOLDIER

Remo only catches a flash of a fist before we

CUT TO BLACK

INT TENT -— DAY

Conan pulls back the flap of Remo’s tent revealing
TAMARA lying bound to one of the tent’s support poles

Tamara’s eyes go wide in fear as Conan pulls out his
dagger--but he only slices off her gag expertly not so
much as nicking her skin

CONAN
Who are you

TAMARA
I am nobody

Conan simply smirks knowing Tamara is lying He cuts the
bonds tying her to the pole and pulls her out of the
tent

EXT TENT — DAY
The camp outside bears the evidence of a one-sided
battle the dead bodies of the cavalrymen lying sprawled
in every direction Remo’s beaten body lies lashed to a
nearby tree
Tamara takes in the gruesome sight shocked
CONAN
Nobody Quite a lot of men sent to

capture nobody wouldn’t you say

Tamara recoils from Conan terrified of the man who has
single-handedly wrought such brutality

CONAN (CONTD)
Why does Khalar Singh want you

TAMARA
I don’t know

Conan looks at Tamara but her face only shows confusion
Conan cuts the bonds at her wrists

CONAN
Then let’s hope it’s for your cooking
EXT CAMPFIRE - NIGHT

Tamara struggles to manage a cooking pot over the blaze
Conan relaxes nearby sharpening the blade of his dagger

Tamara steals glances at an unconscious Remo who
occasionally GROANS in pain

TAMARA
You killed all the rest Why do you keep
that one alive

CONAN
I enjoy a little music with my meal

Tamara isn’t amused by Conan’s reply

TAMARA
I never knew men could be so cruel Now I
wonder if the world is filled with
animals such as you

CONAN
You speak of animals as if they were less
than men But animals don’t stab their
brothers in the back or steal their
mother’s only possession And they never

lie
TAMARA

I haven’t lied to you Not once
CONAN

Very well Give me your name
TAMARA

T am Tamara Amelia Karushan And you
CONAN

I am Conan
TAMARA

Conan That’s it

CONAN
What more names do I need

Conan pulls out jerky and gnaws on it He offers none to
Tamara

CONAN (CONTD)
There is only one truth I need from you
Tamara Amelia Karushan Whatever reason
Khalar Singh wants you is it enough for
him to come in person to collect you

Tamara eventually nods
CONAN (CONT’D)
Good Because by the smell of that stew
it’s not for your cooking
Conan hands Tamara the jerky and marches off into the
darkness

EXT FORTRESS - ESTABLISHING

The stone fortress of Khalar Singh looms darkly over the
city of Khor Kalba

INT FORTRESS - DUNGEON - CIRCULAR CHAMBER - NIGHT

A perfect circle carved into black rock Sixty feet in
diameter the walls rise even farther up

And upon the walls a spiderwork of iron chains
suspending PRISONERS by stretched and distended limbs
faces wracked in agony

The higher prisoners are unrecognizable but lining the
lower walls we find the FEMALE MONKS from the oasis
Their faces are filled with agony and terror as though
unspeakable things have already been done to them

THE JAILER

A mountain of flesh seven feet tall and almost four
hundred pounds his oversized body is crisscrossed with
heavy links of chain that CLATTER as he walks

The Jailer unchains one of the female monks from the
lower wall lowering her body like a doll in his huge
hands He carries her over to

THE WELL

In the center of the circular floor is what appears to be
a deep well surrounded by black robed CHANTING priests

KHALAR SINGH

The warlord observes the proceedings alongside Ukafa
Khalar Singh’s face is grim and drawn

The Monk fights the Jailer as best she can but she is no
more than a gnat fighting against his gargantuan form

The Jailer lifts her over to the well and THROWS HER IN
She falls six feet and lands--
ON A HUGE WRITHING PILE OF THE BLACK WORMS

Khalar Singh nods to the HEAD PRIEST The priests’
CHANTING rises in tone and volume

HEAD PRIEST
Dark Ones of Acheron seers of the
blackest arts judge the one laid before
you

The Monk SCREAMS as the writhing worms suddenly attack
THEY BURROW INTO HER SKIN RACING UP HER LEGS AND ARMS
EXPLORING HER TORSO AND THEN FINALLY INVADING HER HEAD

Hundreds of worms enter and leave her each one causing
excruciating pain

And suddenly her eyes open wide staring up at Khalar
Singh The eyes of a possessed woman

When she opens her mouth to speak worms pour from it
and the voice that issues forth is that of a thousand
demonic voices

POSSESSED MONK
This one is a vessel of Acheronian blood
(more worms infest her)
But the Heir to the Royal Line she is
NOT

KHALAR SINGH
Can you use the blood

POSSESSED MONK
The blood is potent for many things What
is your desire

KHALAR SINGH
I desire the power of Acheron itself To
fell cities with a wave of my hand To
command the armies of the possessed To
feel the power of the dark gods
themselves coursing through my veins

POSSESSED MONK
Only the sacrifice of the Queen can grant
you your desire

Instantly the worms leave her body And when they leave
no holes remain in her skin No evidence of what happened
to her besides the look in her eyes The same look as
the others

The Jailer reaches down and plucks her out of the well

Khalar Singh storms out Ukafa following him

INT GRAND HALL - NIGHT

Khalar Singh climbs out of the dungeon into a long
columned hall of the fortress proper Ukafa has to hurry
to match his stride

URKAFA
My Lord--

KHALAR SINGH
None of them None The one that escaped
is the Heir I knew it from the start

UKAFA
You are closer than ever before Khalar
Singh Your kingdom is within your grasp

Khalar rubs at tired eyes exhaustion overcoming rage

KHALAR SINGH
Teasing They taunt me with my failure

Ukafa looks confused

UKAFA

Khalar Singh changes the subject

KHALAR SINGH

twice as many men searching for her
Every field hill and mountain

AERIAL SHOT - POV - SOARING

Across steep valleys and up jagged peaks we race into
steep and unforgiving mountains Cresting over a set of
peaks a gorge is revealed below and beneath it--

EXT ACHERON - NIGHT —- MOVING

A city carved out of the purple granite of a mountainous
gorge Hundred-foot towers rise up their pinnacles
crafted to depict ANGRY GOD-LIKE FACES

We GLIDE DOWN past thin mists of swirling smoke towards
the growing sounds of SCREAMING and WAILING

The streets of Acheron are lined with thousands of
SLAVES young and old chained together toiling under
the lash of their cruel masters the

ACHERONIANS

Their armor crafted from the bones of their defeated
enemies rises to a mask which cover much of their
features Only the red irises of their eyes peer through

The slaves hobble down the main boulevard their naked
feet splashing in streams of BLOOD which flow from the

ACHERONIAN PYRAMID

Up ahead looms a colossal pyramid and as we grow closer
the grotesque surface becomes clearer one hewn from
cracked bone and empty sockets

The three hundred foot high edifice is made ENTIRELY OF

THOUSANDS OF HUMAN SKULLS Many of the skulls still drip
with blood pouring down from the pyramid’s crest where
stands

A STONE ALTAR

Images of snakes gorging themselves on hapless victims
are carved in bas relief into the altar’s surface

Upon the blood soaked altar lies tied a STRUGGLING NAKED
WOMAN bound by her hands her terrified features
partially covered by a woven blindfold

Several ROBED PRIESTS stand beside her CHANTING One of
them hands an ORNATE DAGGER made entirely of a carved red
gemstone to the HEAD PRIESTESS

The Head Priestess approaches the altar the light from
the torches illuminating her face

IT IS TAMARA Her eyes seem lost far away She reaches
down towards the bound woman pulling off the sacrificial
blindfold revealing her face

SHE HAS TAMARA’S FACE AS WELL

THE DAGGER

The ruby hilt GLEAMS as it is thrust down into its
victim’s chest SCREAM

cur TO

EXT ROCK OUTCROPPING NIGHT

Tamara leaps up SCREAMING herself Her face is covered
in sweat her eyes as terrified as the victim from her
dream

Tamara tries to wipe her head but her hands and feet are
tied She looks around but Conan isn’t there--nor is
Remo

Below in the distance the fortress of Khalar Singh is
perched atop a sheer cliff overlooking the city of Khor
Kalba Not far off is an open field just beyond the
fortress’s defenses

EXT OPEN FIELD - NIGHT

MUFFLED SCREAMS We pull out of Remo’s wide mouth
stuffed with cloth trying to bellow in uncontrollable
agony

A hand comes in and pulls out the cloth It’s Conan

REMO
Please Mercy

CONAN
I could It would be an easy thing to
show mercy But what would it profit me

Remo cannot move his head but he turns his eyes toward
the sound

REMO
Where am I Why can I not move

We PULL OUT revealing that Remo is strapped to a
CATAPULT Conan is finishing the job of lashing Remo to a
large boulder

CONAN
Your back is broken You will never move
again At least not without some
assistance

REMO
Wait Wait

Conan pauses

REMO (CONT’D)
You don’t need to do this You said you
seek profit Have you heard the name of
Khalar Singh You have that which he
craves You have the girl right Khalar
will give you whatever you want for her
And more

CONAN
Why would he Who is she

Remo pauses not wanting to answer Conan cranks back the
catapult’s arm

REMO
Wait She’s the one Hes been searching
all of Hyboria for her for over twenty
years She is a queen

CONAN
(realizing)
Twenty years

REMO
In her lies a great power One Khalar
Singh would pay dearly for

Conan’s expression darkens

CONAN
So I should ransom her to your master
Not exactly loyal Remo--but still a
good idea

Conan pulls out a sheet of handwritten paper places it
on Remo’s chest and then THRUSTS A DAGGER through it
into the soldier’s chest
CONAN (CONTD)

Youll help me deliver it
EXT OUTER WALL - KHOR KALBA — NIGHT
Ukafa inspects Khor Kalba’s outermost defense walls He
eyes the SOLDIERS at attention Just then a SHADOW
passes over him He hears SCREAMING
CRASH A BOULDER smashes through the wall pulverizing
the column Ukafa just passed Half of the wall collapses

in with it creating a large cloud of dust and debris

As the dust settles Ukafa finds an impact crater in the
far wall where the BOULDER settled

And he sees Remo tied to it

CUT TO

KHALAR

Now stands over the impact crater left by Remo’s earthly
plunge

KHALAR SINGH
Is that Remo

UKAFA
It is

A fury rises in Khalar Singh And then he notices the
note stuffed in the uniform He pulls it out

It is covered with blood but still readable

KHALAR SINGH
A ransom demand for the girl For me to
deliver in person

UKAFA
Ill go--and come back with their heads

KHALAR SINGH
No I’ll not risk losing her again Fetch
me triple the ransom Be ready to ride at
dawn But once the deal is made be ready
to strike

EXT ROCK OUTCROPPING - NIGHT

Conan returns from the nearby hills carrying a pair of
rabbits he’s hunted and skinned

He looks around surprised not to find Tamara He hears a
yelp from nearby and walks to a dirt path beyond the
clearing

TAMARA

She’s tied up and gagged and she’s wormed her way this
far muddying and scraping herself all along the way She
lets out a frustrated grunt as Conan simply picks her
back up and carries her back to the outcropping

He pulls the gag from her mouth and drops a skinned
rabbit at her feet

CONAN
Here Eat
Tamara squirms away from the carcass disgusted

TAMARA
Does it bother you blood on your hands

Conan tears into his rabbit chewing on the raw meat

CONAN
At least the only blood on these hands I
claimed with my own sword

TAMARA
What do you mean

CONAN
How much spilled blood bears your name

TAMARA
Me Unlike you I never took a life

Conan confronts her enraged

CONAN
You lie You are the very reason my
people are dead

TAMARA
It’s you who spreads lies I never met
your people

CONAN
Why should royalty ever meet the people
they are responsible for killing

TAMARA
Royalty You think me royalty

CONAN
I know you are

Conan simply returns to eating his food Tamara quiets

confused

TAMARA
Will you do me one favor someday

Conan angrily LAUGHS

CONAN
Me A favor for you I must hear it

TAMARA
Tell me Tell me who I am

Now is Conan’s turn to be confused He stares her in the
eye He does not see what he expects It troubles him

CONAN
I see you are not hungry

Conan puts her gag back in her mouth roughly Tamara
sits in silence very slowly rubbing her ropes on a sharp
stone in her lap

DISSOLVE TO

EXT BOULDER FIELD — DAY

As the sun rises Khalar Singh guides his horse through a
wide field of ten foot high boulders

Khalar Singh halts at a clearing in the center of the
boulder field

KHALAR SINGH
(yelling)
I have come as you asked and I have
tripled your ransom as a sign of good
faith Show me your captive

CAMERA FLIES UP and over the crests of several boulders
finding Conan close by hiding behind one of the great
stones Tamara is tied up on the ground nearby

TAMARA
I beg you Don’t do this

CONAN
Be still

KHALAR SINGH
Khalar eyes the boulder field uncomfortable with
obstructions to his view He looks back at Ukafa on the

hillside behind him

KHALAR SINGH
Be at the ready

Khalar spurs his horse forward
TAMARA’S BACK

Tamara continues to scrape away at her bonds the rope
now clearly frayed
TAMARA
I’ve seen what this man can do He will
never let you take the ransom and live

Conan begins to hear the sound of Khalar’s horse
approaching

CONAN
Still your tongue The only reason I
wrote a ransom note is that few respond
to an invitation to their own death

Tamara is surprised but before she can respond Conan
steps out from behind the boulder

KHALAR SINGH AND CONAN

The two great warriors take in each other from fifty
feet

Khalar reaches into his saddle and pulls out a canvas
bag He opens the sack revealing a treasure in gold
coins

KHALAR SINGH
There’s the gold Tell your men to bring
out the girl

CONAN
There are no others

Khalar Singh looks at Conan curiously

KHALAR SINGH
Then youll be rich indeed Where is the

girl

CONAN
She lives Come closer and see for
yourself

As Khalar cautiously rides closer then STOPS

KHALAR SINGH
Show me the girl now

Conan turns back to behind the boulder
BUT TAMARA IS GONE ALL THAT’S LEFT IS THE TORN ROPE

CONAN POV

Time slows his heart THUNDERS His leg muscles flex
launching him toward Khalar Singh

Khalar Singh’s eyes go wide not expecting this He
shifts on his horse slowly retreating

In one fluid motion Conan leaps into the air Khalar’s
brow furrows confused The man’s farthest leap is not
half the distance between them

But before Conan falls back to earth his foot finds the
side of a boulder and he pushes off it carrying him
sideways but also higher His foot hits another boulder
sending him back towards Khalar Singh and even higher
now his momentum sending him soaring right for Khalar
Singh’s head

Khalar Singh can barely draw his sword before Conan’s
reaches him Khalar’s blade deflects Conan’s but not
entirely Conan’s sword GRAZES HIS EAR DRAWING BLOOD
Khalar’s second sword cuts into Conan’s arm as he falls
past him He kicks his horse into a gallop and reaches
for his war horn

KHALAR SINGH (CONT’D)
I’1l have your head boy

Conan leaps to his feet and gives chase as Khalar Singh
blows upon the WAR HORN

And in the distance a hundred figures in silhouette
appear on a high ridge
EXT HIGH RIDGE — DAY

The line of figures turns out to be ARCHERS standing
atop the ridge

ARCHERS OF THE BLACK RIVER

Dark skinned with pale yellow eyes the archers are clad
in leather brigandines and menpo headgear As they reach
for their bows we see the archers have FOUR ARMS Each
archer holds two bows at the ready

At their feet are CLAY POTS

Each of them in perfect sync draws two arrows and jabs
it into the pot

IN THE POT

Black and gold scorpions writhe about Two are impaled
their black blood coating the arrowheads

The archers lift their arrows and draw their bows Aimed
into the sky they release at the same moment

EXT BOULDER FIELD - CONTINUOUS

Conan stares up at the sky as it darkens filled with
black arrows

Conan’s eyes go wide and he turns running away from
Khalar Singh

ARROWS

A CLOUD of arrows descends upon Conan He dives beneath
one of the boulders for cover Arrows rain down upon the
rock PINGING off However one of the arrows Manages to
catch Conan in the back of the leg

Conan grimaces and stumbles He pulls out the arrow
revealing the impaled scorpion on the shaft When he
looks up again the archers unleash another volley

Conan brings his sword up at the last possible second
swinging wild and cutting the arrows right out of the
air

Conan turns and runs RIGHT INTO TAMARA He instinctively
grabs her

TAMARA
Let me go

CONAN
Youve cost me my vengeance today But
perhaps I’ll still have it tomorrow

TAMARA
And I wouldn’t stop you But I don’t
believe Khalar is interested in your deal
anymore

Tamara points up as the sky fills with another barrage of
arrows Conan sees the sky darkening with them

CONAN
Crom

TAMARA
I saw a way out Trust me Just let me
go

Conan considers it then lets her go as arrows start
raining down around them

KHALAR SINGH
Khalar Singh rides up onto the ridge

KHALAR SINGH
Report The girl

ARCHER
She’s with the brigand They‘re out of
range but he was struck by arrow fire

Khalar smiles

KHALAR SINGH
Then they won’t get far

CONAN AND TAMARA

Tamara sees an open field of tall grass ahead of them
Conan stumbles and falls to his knees

CONAN’S POV His vision blurs and shifts

TAMARA
What is it

Conan touches at the arrow wound on his calf

CONAN
Poison

Tamara’s eyes race from the freedom of the open field
back to the reeling Conan Decision time

TAMARA
Lean on me

Tamara does her best to hold up the massive warrior as
they head for the high grass

EXT HIGH RIDGE - CONTINUOUS

Khalar Singh watches his prey disappear into the grass

KHALAR SINGH
Ukafa

Ukafa appears beside him

UKAFA
Yes my Lord

KHALAR SINGH
Send the dogs after the warrior And the
infantry after the girl The entire
legion

Ukafa turns to face his DOG HANDLER The Handler holds
the chains to five huge BLACK DOGS their haunches
covered in armor faces fierce and angry

The Dog Handler sets them loose They tear off after
Conan

And behind them comes an entire legion of the battle-—
hardened TROOPS clad in black armor following them into
the grassy field

EXT GRASS PLAIN - DAY

The dogs race into the tall grass demons possessed And
just a bit behind them the legion advances The soldiers
fan out and slow down carefully searching each inch of
grass They make sure nothing gets past them

CONAN
Deep in the grass Conan falls to the ground His eyes

are wild and his entire body is covered in sweat Tamara
looks over his wound

TAMARA
Banded scorpion venom
CONAN
Is that all
TAMARA

I am shocked you’ve lasted this long

And then they hear the HOWLS of the advancing dogs

TAMARA (CONTD)
What was that

CONAN
Get behind me

Conan struggles to stand He falls back to one knee

TAMARA
Perhaps you’d do better to get behind me

CONAN
Why do you stay when you could run

TAMARA
Do you really wish me to think about that
at this moment

Tamara takes Conan’s sword By the way she holds it it’s
clearly the first time she’s brandished steel

BLACK DOGS

Through the grass bound two more of the beasts their
jowls glistening with saliva They rush at Tamara at the
same moment

CU - TAMARA’S EYES

Her eyes are fearful focused Again we hear a strange
chiming sound the air grows thick

BLACK DOGS

They launch forward ready to strike AND THEN THEY STOP
They GROWL whining as if faced with a chasm they cannot
cross Frustrated they TURN ON EACH OTHER ripping at
their flesh their battle taking them far from Tamara

CONAN
By Crom--what sorcery have you

Tamara is clearly as shocked as Conan

MORE BLACK DOGS

However Tamara doesn’t notice two more the beasts racing
up behind her They’re about to strike when Conan
appears smashing one of the dog’s heads right into the

head of the other They fall unconscious

But that pretty much uses up what energy Conan had in
store He looks ready to collapse

YELLS in the distance The grass moves in every
direction

TAMARA
We have to run Conan

CONAN
We run now we die

But Conan doesn’t get up Instead he looks down at the
unconscious animals an idea forming

CONAN (CONTD)
What is on the other side of this grass

TAMARA
Open ground Nowhere to hide

CONAN
It will be enough

TAMARA
Enough for what

CUT TO

MINI-MONTAGE

Grass is gathered up in bundles tied together like
torches

-- A blade strikes flint creating a shower of sparks
- The eyes of the unconscious beast flicker open Eyes
of fear

EXT GRASS PLAIN - DAY

The dogs HOWL as they leap to their feet Tied to their
tails are burning bundles of grass on fire

They run from the flames that nip at their fur But all
they do is fan the flames and spread it through the
tall dry grass

In moments the entire grass field smokes

THE LEGION

Swords out they advance methodically searching for
Conan and Tamara

They stop when they hear the howling They raise their
swords only to see their own dogs run right past them
Then they see the fire

SOLDIER
Retreat

But it is too late AN INFERNO ERUPTS ALL AROUND THEM

EXT RIDGE - DAY

Khalar Singh’s face darkens as he sees the fields ablaze
and he hears the screams of his men

KHALAR SINGH
Spread men from this place to the four
pointsof the compass Nothing leaves
this valley alive until she is found

EXT EDGE OF THE GRASS PLAIN - DAY

Tamara carrying Conan emerges from the blazing grass
the sound of SCREAMS echoing in the distance

FADE TO BLACK

INT CORINS FORGE - NIGHT

The sparks of the forge rise into the night like stars
shooting in the opposite direction

CORIN
More wood boy We must test the steel
with our fire

Conan a young boy again kneels beside the woodpile
pulling out logs--

But when he hands them to his father he notices his
father is covered with sword wounds cut and bleeding

CORIN (CONTD)
What are you waiting for The fire is
dying

Conan turns back to the wood pile Instead of wood the
pile is full of the bodies of those he recently killed
Lucius Remo the cavalry guards etc

The young Conan struggles to push the first body onto the
roaring forge

But when he turns to get the next---
TAMARA stands there a look of sadness on her face

CONAN
Father I am sorry--

CORIN
You have not begun to repay your debt
boy Feed the fire

CONAN
I do not wish to

Corin looks at his son with sadness in his eyes
CORIN
Through suffering we gain strength boy
And you have not begun to suffer yet

CUT TO

INT GUEST ROOM - NIGHT
Conan rises with a start

CONAN
Father

The room is dark as the windows are covered with thick
draperies Conan lies on a straw bed with white sheets
soaked through with his sweat He looks to his wounds
all bandaged

He rises--a bit too fast because he falls back to his
bed

SIMURA
Take your time warrior Youve been
through a lot

Sitting in the corner is Simura one of the monks from
the oasis

Conan ignores his advice and forces himself to stand

CONAN
Sword

Simura’s eyes flicker over to the other corner where his
sword and clothes lie

Conan snaps up his sword with one hand as his other
clotheslines Simura knocking him to the floor

In an instant Conan’s sword is to his throat

CONAN (CONTD)
Where am I Where is Khalar Singh

Simura is amused

SIMURA
She said you were single-minded--and fast-
- but I had no idea Khalar Singh is back
in his fortress at Khor Kalba along with
dozens of our people as his captives We
are Tamara’s people

CONAN
Why should I believe you

SIMURA
You are free to believe what you wish As
you are free to stay or leave

Conan releases Simura He walks out the door

EXT TURANIAN GALLEY —- NIGHT

Conan steps out onto the deck of a sixty-foot ship
traveling quickly down a wide and powerful river

Conan is shocked He had no idea he was on a ship Simura
comes up behind him

SIMURA
Of course leaving may require a bit of
patience

The dual-masted DHOW is manned by two dozen PIRATES hard-
looking sailors tanned bronze from years on Vilayet Sea

Their leader CAPTAIN ARTUS sports a beard that nearly
covers his face leaving only squinty eyes to take in the
barbarian

CONAN
Pirates
SIMURA
The Red Brotherhood Their prices are
rightly extortion but this was the best
way to slip Khalar Singh’s noose

CONAN
You are fools to trust them

SIMURA
Perhaps we were fools to help a stranger
like yourself Tamara dragged you a
league to save your life

Conan accepts the truth with a nod
CONAN

And now you expect my help with your
cause

Simura glances around gauging their privacy
SIMURA
No Conan Tomorrow when we dock I
expect you to walk away It is best--for
both our concerns

Conan is surprised by the answer

CONAN
Where is she

Simura nods to the fore of the ship Tamara stands alone
her eyes fixed upon the waves that lap against the hull

SIMURA
Tamara has only now learned of her true
heritage A heavy burden for one so
young

Conan starts towards her but Simura stops him
SIMURA (CONT’D)

She is with her people now Best that you
finish your business here and return to

yours

CONAN
My people are no more Khalar Singh saw
to that

cuT TO

EXT BORDER TOWN - NIGHT

A line of a dozen VILLAGERS are forcibly lined up in
front of Khalar Singh In the background other of
Khalar’s SOLDIERS stand ready to burn the village’s huts

Ukafa reports back to his glowering general

UKAFA
My Lord the villagers all say they’ve
seen no sign of the girl or the
Northerner But there is one thing

Ukafa pulls out a piece of parchment

UKAFA (CONTD)
This was found back at boulder field It
appears the Northerner dropped it

Ukafa hands it over Khalar’s face goes ashen

KHALAR SINGH
Bring me the Traitor

CUT TO

THE TRAITOR

A man in robes is led past the shackled villagers by a
pair of soldiers We recognize the scarlet color of the
robes—-it’s the same as then men in Tamara’s tribe

Khalar Singh his back to us doesn’t turn as Traitor
arrives He simply holds up the parchment

IT’S CONAN’S PARCHMENT EVERY FACE CROSSED OUT SAVE UKAFA
AND KHALAR

KHALAR SINGH

For twenty years I have searched for a
woman who I have now seen with my own
eyes For nearly as long a Cimmerian it
seems has searched to kill me That
their paths have now become one can be no
coincidence traitor If you aren’t even
worthy of the trust of your own people
how can I trust I’m not being deceived

BAEL (0S)
I am but a simple servant
As Khalar turns to face the Traitor we see it is BAEL
Fassir’s right hand

BAEL (CONTD)
You were shown the way to the monastery
This man is a demon of your own creation

Khalar throws the parchment into a nearby fire

KHALAR SINGH
I have room for no more demons I saw his
eyes and in them no fear

BAEL
You worry about the wrong eyes It is the
girl you must come to fear now

KHALAR SINGH
What Why

BAEL
Now that she has fled from the monastery
her true nature will begin to show
itself The powers you seek to take will
only become stronger in her She could
use them against us

Khalar’s anger begins to bubble over

KHALAR SINGH
Us They will be used against me No
That is not to be my destiny Tell me how
to find her

Bael smiles

BAEL
It has already been done She and the few
of my people that remain free are being
aided by pirates

Khalar is clearly relieved

KHALAR SINGH
Your service to me will reap rewards once
the power of Acheron is mine

BAEL
(smiling)
T am but a simple servant
Khalar gets atop his horse ready to ride off Ukafa
approaches him again He motions to the chained
villagers

UKAFA
What of the them

KHALAR SINGH
Kill them all

Even the brutal Ukafa looks surprised

UKAFA
My Lord The sea is the other direction
these people knew nothing of our quarry

KHALAR SINGH
Also burn the town We can show no
weakness I am too close now to afford a
stumble

Khalar Singh gets on his horse

KHALAR SINGH (CONT’D)
Send word when it is done I return to
Khor Kalba

EXT TURANIAN GALLEY - NIGHT

The sails of the ship lie furled a dead calm leaving the

surface of the water as smooth as glass

Conan sits atop the deck of the galley the panoply of
stars cascading above him He drinks from a flask of
mead

TAMARA (0S)
Do you hate me

Conan turns as Tamara walks up Tamara looks different in

evening light her eyes seem older her demeanor more
woman-like sexier

CONAN
Hate

TAMARA
Were it not for me your people would
live It is as you said If I lay claim
to the blood on my hands then I should
drown in it

CONAN
That claim is Khalar Singh’s alone My
debt is with him

TAMARA
Perhaps But if this is how it feels to
be royalty it’s a curse

Tamara starts off

CONAN
Tamara
(she stops)
I spared your life You spared mine
There is no debt owed

TAMARA

It is as you say Though I have many more
debts still unpaid Even now my people
suffer at Khalar’s hands I must find a
way to free them though Simura and the
others only desire that I be hidden away
once more But I will fight alone if I
must

Conan doesn’t answer and she starts off again Conan
frowns It still doesn’t sit well with him

CONAN

I called you a liar
TAMARA
What
CONAN

I called you a liar when you were
truthful in your dealings with me To my
people that would be a grave insult

She sees he is still troubled She returns to sit beside
him He swigs deeply from his mead

TAMARA
Do you think--I could try some of that
I’m curious of its taste

CONAN
You’ve never tasted mead

Tamara shrugs embarrassed Conan hands her flask She
takes a deep swallow some spilling out over her cheeks
But she doesn’t cough and smiles brightly afterwards

TAMARA
I envy you Conan Drinking deeply of
life Next to you I feel I have not lived
at all

CONAN
I know the rich juices of red meat and
stinging wine on my palate a woman’s hot
embrace the mad exultation of battle
But until my peoples’ debt is paid they
are fleeting joys I drink deeply but
the thirst remains It is not a life to
envy

Tamara drinks as watches Conan intently catching a
glimpse of the keen mind beneath his rough exterior

TAMARA
Once you’ve killed Khalar and claimed
your vengeance then what You will be
free from your ghosts What of your
future Conan
Conan pauses the question hanging in the air
CONAN

I have no future It died with my people
as I should have

EXT TURANIAN GALLEY - MORNING
Tamara wakens with a start She’s alone on the deck
which lies deserted She hears a THUMPING sound followed
by ANOTHER and walks towards the side of the deck
Tamara looks overboard to the water below
TAMARA’S POV
THE RIVER IS FILLED WITH BODIES Bloated and burned they
float in blood red water as flies buzz around them One
of them hits the hull of the boat THUMP
Tamara SCREAMS

CUT TO
BACK TO SCENE

Tamara WAKES still screaming her face drenched in
sweat She finds herself held fast in Conan’s broad arms

CONAN
Easy Youre safe

Tamara calms realizing it was just a dream But though
she doesn’t struggle she looks at Conan with unease

TAMARA
No were not

She pushes away running inside the cabin As Conan’s
eyes follow her they spot Simura watching him closely

Simura approaches

SIMURA
It is just beginning

CONAN
What is

SIMURA

Her--condition Surely you must realize
there is sorcery within her

CONAN
I only know she has been lied to and
seeks answers

SIMURA
Answers will do her no good What do you
know of Acheron

CONAN
A ancient myth A fairy tale told to
frighten Aquilonian children

SIMURA
Acheron is ancient but it is no myth It
was the darkest hour of man an empire
that swallowed all of Hyboria dedicated
to dark gods powerful magics and blood
sacrifices without end It was a painful
history few would choose to remember

CONAN
Yet you have

SIMURA
Because we must They are our ancestors

Simura produces an ORNATE DAGGER made entirely of a
carved red gemstone We recognize it from Tamara’s dream
SIMURA (CONTD)
The history of our people is etched in
blood The dark magic of Acheron required
the blood of innocents Countless lives
were taken to fuel their power They
claimed everything they saw until
finally one of their own sought to stop
this evil It was the Queen herself She
held a power greater than all the others
save her husband the king

Simura hands Conan the dagger

SIMURA (CONTD)
So with this very dagger she killed him
Then she turned her dark magic upon her
own people Never has the world seen such
fury such destruction The great cities
of Acheron burned in flames that raged
for a hundred years until the mountains
around them collapsed burying all
beneath the earth There they lay their
secrets hidden for all time

Conan looks more closely at the dagger its ruby seems
filled with a liquid one that undulates as if alive

SIMURA (CONTD)

That is why Khalar Singh seeks Tamara
Because the power of her ancestor the
Queen still lies in Tamara’s blood If
he were to sacrifice her--it would become
his

CONAN
Why not have her use this power against
him If it is as you say she could
easily lay waste to his army

SIMURA
Tamara’s power has been kept a mystery to
her for her own good The dark magic of
Acheron is pure evil it bends all to its
will even the Queen Once sparked the
evil would consume her and all around
her This cannot be at any cost

Conan’s eyebrows raise
CONAN

And how would you prevent it How could
you protect her from herself

SIMURA
We will do what we must--

SENTRY SHIP APPROACHING

Conan and Simura turn to the river ahead Through a thick
morning fog a dark shadow pierces the veil

A WARSHIP OF KHORAJA

A black-sailed warship dual banks of oars heaving down
and up knifes its way through the water towards the
galley

SENTRY (0S) (CONT’D)
WARSHIP

PIRATE GALLEY

Conan races to the bow of the galley to get a better
look

On the deck of the warship armored WARRIORS and a
contingent of the four-armed ARCHERS stand ready to board
their prey

Conan’s eyes alight with fury

CONAN
Good I was growing weary with boredom

MONTAGE

The pirates and monks prepare for battle weapons are
handed out sails are trimmed

The MONKS assemble around Conan near the bow

CONAN (CONT’D)
They cannot board and defend at the same
time so that is the moment to strike
Shortsword and axe are better than
broadswords

JASIM
You know of what you speak

CONAN
I am not new to the ways of piracy which
is why I never trusted our benefactors

CAPTAIN ARTUS (0S)
Wise words my friend

Conan turns to see Tamara being held by Captain Artus
the pirate’s dagger held fast to her neck

CAPTAIN ARTUS (CONT’D)
It would seem Khalar Singh offers a true
king’s ransom for our cargo Men take
them

The forty pirates step across the deck closing on Conan
and the dozen monks

The warship nears now only a hundred yards away
Conan just laughs stepping towards Artus

CONAN
You picked the wrong shield Captain

CAPTAIN ARTUS
Keep your distance Cimmerian

CONAN
Khalar Singh wants her alive Do you know
what would happen if she dies in your
charge

The Captain looks at Tamara and lowers the blade at her
neck

Lightning fast Conan grabs Jasim’s short sword and hurls
it like a dagger It passes right through Artus’ throat
nailing him to the mast

Conan quickly grabs Tamara and throws her into the cabin
away from pirates

BATTLE

The enraged pirates ROAR and charge Conan and the others
Conan lodges a battle axe in a pirate’s skull even as he
spins to slice through a pair of pirates’ chests with his
broadsword

simura and Jasim display the Order’s unique style of
fighting combining slashing scimitars with the lithe
footwork of kung fu Covering each other’s backs the two
men cut down a half dozen pirates in a matter of seconds

But the battle belongs to Conan Enraged he barely
notices as a pirate slashes his arm drawing blood

Conan hacks and whirls like a madman his battle rage
instilling fear and awe in the bewildered pirates

Conan feels someone behind him and he turns to strike--
only to have his blade parried by Jasim

JASIM
Perhaps we were wrong about you
Cimmerian One who fights with such heart
must believe in something

The two men share a satisfied grin--until an ARROW FLIES
THROUGH THE AIR LODGING ITSELF IN JASIM’S BACK The
warrior goes down Conan looks up seeing

THE WARSHIP

The ship draws close putting Conan and the others in
danger of the archers’ fire

PIRATE GALLEY

Although he sees Simura and the others barely holding
their own Conan turns his back on them and runs towards
the rear deck of the ship The wounded Jasim spots him

JASIM (CONT’D)
He’s fleeing The barbarian looks to
save his own skin

CONAN
Conan smashes his way through a group of pirates
bullying his way to the steering wheel slashing ropes

and lowering sails as he goes

He reaches the wheel where the PILOT stands Conan snaps
the Pilot’s neck and grabs hold of the wheel

Conan uses all his strength to spin the giant wheel of
the ship turning the galley DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF
THE WARSHIP

WARSHIP

The SHIP CAPTAIN of the warship stares intently as the
pirate galley moves closer He BARKS out an order and the
warship tacks slightly to starboard

But as he tacks SO DOES THE PIRATE GALLEY

SHIP CAPTAIN
Madness

CONAN

Behind the wheel grinning as the two ships speed towards
collision

WARSHIP

The Ship Captain furiously barks commands but he can’t
stop his ship from colliding into with the pirate galley

SHIP CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
Collision

TAMARA

She steps out from the cabin into the thick of the
battle She spots a DARKNESS creeping over her It’s the
shadow of the warship’s mast as the two boats bear down
upon each other

SMASH

The impact crumples both ships rending their decks and
sending bodies flying in every direction The barrels of
pitch spill sending liquid flame across the pirate deck
The flames quickly spreads to the warship as well

SIMURA
Simura struggles to his feet spotting Tamara amidships

SIMURA
Tamara Look out

Tamara turns as the huge main mast of the warship cracks
and snaps crushing men beneath its weight crumpling the
deck--and its about to crush Tamara when it STOPS IN
MIDATR

THE MAST

The fifty foot long mast hovers aflame suspended
ominously high above the deck of the ship

TAMARA

Her eyes are wild focused on the mast We hear the
HUMMING sound of her power crackling through the air

SIMURA

His face is aghast as he gapes at the floating mast

SIMURA (CONT’D)
We have already failed

Simura picks up a fallen spear lifting and hurling it--
AT TAMARA

TAMARA - SLOW MOTION

Tamara can only watch the airborne weapon as it bears
down on her But at the last second CONAN DIVES INTO
HER PUSHING HER OUT OF THE SPEARS PATH

The flaming mast DROPS AS WELL crashing through the deck
of the ship sending flame and debris skyward

Conan pulls Tamara over the gunwales and into the water

Just then the ships’ hulls SNAP sending debris and man

down together into the deep water All that’s left behind
is a POOL OF FIRE from the flaming pitch

CONAN AND TAMARA

Conan swims for shore pulling Tamara behind him

EXT SHORELINE — DAY

Conan pulls himself and a soggy Tamara out of the water
Tamara struggles to keep her emotions in check

TAMARA
What is happening with me That mast——-was
it my doing I don’t understand My head--
it pounds so

Conan doesn’t answer he just pulls off his jerkin
revealing a torso rippling with muscles

TAMARA (CONTD)
And Simura Ive known him all my life
He--he tried to kill me

CONAN
People try to kill me every day You will
grow used to it

Tamara is incredulous as Conan spots a nearby fishing
leanto
INT FISHING LEAN TO DAY

Conan enters the small enclosure wringing the water
the jerkin He inspects a pair of barrels nearby

CONAN
This is good luck This food should be
enough to keep you for a few days

TAMARA
Me Where are you going

CONAN
To Khor Kalba and Khalar Singh

TAMARA
As am I I must save my people

CONAN
Was it not your people who just tried to
take your life

TAMARA
He was confused He believed me to be the
enemy

CONAN

That much is true But Simura knew his
target all too well

TAMARA
None of it changes that my people rest in
Khalar’s hands and need my help
(beat)
Please Conan I can’t hide as others die
in my name Not again

Conan nods understanding her plight all to well
CONAN
I will get you into the fortress Beyond
that I have my purpose and you yours
Tamara nods strengthened by his words
TAMARA
Where are we headed Khalar’s army must

be headed this way

CONAN
Come We climb

from

Tamara looks at the landscape before her Plains to the
left a valley to the right mountains dead ahead

TAMARA
Climb

CONAN
We go where an army cannot

EXT KHALAR SINGH’S FORTRESS - DAY

Establishing shot of the dark fortress gleaming in the
light of dawn

INT THRONE ROOM - DAY
Bael enters the room Khalar sitting upon the throne

KHALAR SINGH
She has evaded me again Rumors soar
through the men A pirate who survived
spoke of a ship’s mast held aloft by a
force of magic

BAEL
Then our time is short We must find her
now

KHALAR SINGH
Which is why I called for you The
Cimmerian proves himself a demon after
all Perhaps we need a demon to fight a
demon

Bael looks away uneasy with Khalar’s suggestion

BAEL
There must be another way And without
something of his a demon could no sooner
find him than you can

Khalar Singh draws his sword There on the blade dried
blood

KHALAR SINGH
I glanced his arm when he attacked me in
the boulder field

BAEL
Do you know what you are asking The gods
of Acheron bear a heavy price

KHALAR SINGH
I know all to well

BAEL
But are you truly prepared to suffer the
consequences

Khalar’s patience runs out and his drawn sword flies to
Bael’s neck

KHALAR SINGH
That you even ask betrays your weakness
Victory is reserved for those willing to
pay its price Begin the ritual

CUT TO

EXT MOUNTAIN - LATE DAY

Conan and Tamara come across a clearing in the thick
forest At one end stands a lone hut

INT HUNTING HUT - LATE DAY

Conan kicks in the door revealing a simple one room hut
A small stove worn straw bed and some hunting

implements all covered in a thin layer of dust

CONAN
We spend the night here

Conan turns to head out

TAMARA
Where are you going

CONAN
To find food I’1l be back before dark

Conan leaves but Tamara follows him soon after

EXT FOREST — LATE DAY

Tamara watches Conan from a distance He silently stalks
prey with nothing more than a knife

A STAG

Its ears listen intently aware Suddenly it bolts

CONAN

Is just as quick racing through the forest on a
intercepting course with the great beast He leaps over a
fallen log throwing his dagger with a sweep of his arm

The Stag goes down the blade through its jugular Conan
walks up to the struggling beast showing no satisfaction
as he mercifully SNAPS its neck

INT HUNTING HUT - NIGHT

The great haunches of the beast roast over the fire
Conan turns the meat

Behind him Tamara approaches She has cleaned herself
up and she looks stunning in light of the fire

TAMARA
I’ve noticed you have kept your distance
since what happened on the sea What T
did Are you afraid of me now

Conan LAUGHS

CONAN
Deeply afraid

Tamara doesn’t laugh along

TAMARA
I am afraid I feel myself changing and
it frightens me I don’t know what the
gods want of me

CONAN
To damnation with the gods We make our
own destiny and when we see it we grab
hold without hesitation

TAMARA
But to never hesitate--how is it even
possible

CONAN

You must know beyond all doubt what it is
you want and let nothing stand in your
way

TAMARA
I don’t know if I can

CONAN
Back in the field when the poison took
hold of me You saved me without
hesitation You have more strength in you
than you realize

Tamara smiles her eyes sparkling in the fire’s glow
TAMARA
Perhaps it is you who inspires that So
be it Tonight I grab hold of that which

I want

Tamara stands taking off her dress revealing a full
voluptuous body

Conan drinks her in with his eyes

TAMARA (CONT’D)
Do you hesitate Cimmerian

Conan lashes out pulling her to him roughly

INT FORTRESS - DARK CHAMBER — INTERCUT

Khalar Singh stands in the center of a circle lit by
black candles emitting blue flame He scrapes the dried
blood from his sword into a large bowl

Black-robed priests CHANT outside the circle Bael stands
nearby reading from an ancient scroll

BAEL
Xaren before you stands a supplicant
the blood of his enemy for you to taste

LOVE SCENE

Conan lies atop Tamara by the fire their sinewy limbs
intertwined fingers locked together He thrusts into
her causing her face to contort in pleasure and pain

DARK CHAMBER

Khalar Singh’s face contorts as blue flame engulfs him
wracking his body in pain

BAEL (CONT’D)
Xaren take the supplicant’s life force
Feed and grow strong

LOVE SCENE

The fire grows brighter as Tamara rolls on top
undulating as their pace quickens

DARK CHAMBER

Khalar Singh lies prostrate on the ground his body
quaking as the flames leave him forming into a creature
humanoid and pitch black nearly invisible here

It reaches a hand out and lifts the bowl The dried
blood inside instantly turns to liquid BOILING It lifts
the bowl and drinks the blood

BAEL (CONTD)
Xaren seek out the blood Draw him near
Offer him that which he seeks and in his
moment of triumph--destroy him
XARENKHALAR
(a thousand deep voices)
YES
The bowl clatters to the ground Khalar has disappeared
LOVE SCENE

Tamara rolls off Conan clinging to his broad neck They
look at each other and for a moment they are at peace

DISSOLVE TO

EXT CIMMERIA - DAY

Conan as a man comes striding up to Corin’s dead body
pierced by the triangle of spears

As he goes to pull the blade out of his father’s chest
Corin’s EYES OPEN

CORIN
Vengeance

INT HUNTING HUT - NIGHT

Conan wakes up with a start Tamara rests peacefully
beside him Conan looks out the open window of the hut
where the sound of heavy RAINFALL patters the forest
floor

EXT HUNTING HUT - NIGHT

Conan steps out of the hut The clearing before him is
soaked through with water transforming it into a sea of
mud Theres a powerful FLASH of LIGHTNING momentarily
blinding Conan When he can see again-

There’s a man standing at the other end of the clearing
KHALAR SINGH

Only now the general looks quite different His face is
purplish veins crisscrossing underneath his opaque skin
When his eyes open we see no irises instead his pupils
appear entirely black A viscous black ink leaks from the
side of his mouth staining his teeth ebony

KHALAR SINGH
Cimmerian

Conan’s rage is stoked white hot in but a moment Without
bothering to find a weapon he steps out into the
clearing

KHALAR SINGH (CONT’D)
I remember you now You killed my horse
But somehow you were nowhere to be seen
when I ran your father through I didn’t
know they bred cowards in Cimmeria

Conan rushes at Khalar throwing his full weight behind a
uppercut to Khalar’s chin But Khalar seems barely fazed
by the blow and strikes back sending Conan flying into
the mud

CONAN

The Cimmerians struggles to his feet his head still
reeling from the blow

KHALAR SINGH (CONT’D)
Such a waste I could use a warrior such
as you Give me the girl and I’ll spare
your life

Conan leaps upon Khalar like a tiger hands wrapped
around Khalar’s throat Conan manages to pull Khalar to
his knees but Khalar simply grins back at Conan

KHALAR SINGH (CONTD)
You wish to honor your people As a
captain in my legion you’d help conquer
the world All of Cimmeria could be
yours

Conan reaches into his bracer and pulls out his hidden
dagger He thrusts into Khalar’s heart--but Khalar simply
pulls it out and slashes Conan deeply across the chest
Conan falls again to the mud Khalar reaches down and
lifts him by his throat into the air as if Conan weighed
no more than a feather
KHALAR SINGH (CONT’D)

Might is no match for magic barbarian I

learned that lesson long ago now it is

your turn
Conan’s eyes flutter as he struggles for air

TAMARA (0S)
Put him down

TAMARA
She stands at the other edge of the clearing her half
naked body drenched by the rain Her voice seems

different heavy with an ancient resonance

TAMARA (CONTD)
I said--PUT HIM DOWN

CONAN

Drops to the ground clasping at his neck gasping for
breath

KHALAR SINGH

Tamara suddenly appears before him transported across
the clearing in the blink of an eye

THE CLEARING

For a moment everything seems to freeze in time The
raindrops the wind even sound comes to a halt

TAMARA (CONT’D)
You seek me out Here I am

Tamara places her hand upon Khalar’s chest and the
warlord buckles to his knees

Tamara’s face twists in rage her visage almost
unrecognizable from the person we’ve come to know

KHALAR SINGH

His body WRACKS with pain convulsing The earth beneath
him opens up drawing him down into the muddy floor

Khalar YELLS as he disappears beneath the mud

KHALAR’ SINGH
I welcome the pain You cannot break that
which is already broken We will be
together soon my Queen Soon

There’s a FLASH OF LIGHTNING momentarily blinding sight
When the flash subsides Conan rises from the pool of
mud

He spots Tamara barely conscious nearby

TAMARA
Conan Is that you Or have I lost
myself

CONAN

No I will not let that be your destiny

Conan carefully lifts her in his arms carrying her back
towards the hut

INT KHALAR’S FORTRESS - BED CHAMBERS - MORNING

Ukafa comes into the darkened room pulling aside the
heavy window tapestries allowing sunlight to stream into
the room

The light reveals Khalar crouched seating in the corner
of the room his face still hidden in shadow

UKAFA
My Lord scouts have picked up their
trail They crossed the mountains headed
right for Khor Kalba

Khalar steps out of the light revealing a visage damaged
from last night’s events Khalar’s face looks ashen
broken blood vessels splotch his face his eyes still
appear discolored with a hint of green

Even the hearty Ukafa is taken aback by the change

KHALAR SINGH
Get me the traitor Now

Ukafa hesitates

KHALAR SINGH (CONT’D)
Do itt

EXT MOUNTAIN RIDGE DAY

Conan powers his way to the top of a high mountain ridge
spotting down in the vista below

KHOR KALBA

Conan spots a long CARAVAN of packed camels working their
way towards town driven by DESERT TRADERS from Shem

EXT KHOR KHALBA - ENTRANCE — DAY

The caravan rides up to the entrance to the city guarded
by Khalar’s troops Blended in amongst the others Conan
and Tamara now wear the elaborate head scarves and
clothes of Shemish traders obscuring all but their eyes

Conan tugs on the rope for the camel to move faster The
Camel BRAYS and rears Conan yanks harder and the camel
flies forward its eyes wide

Conan meets its eye

CONAN
Do not test me beast

TAMARA
Is there not a living thing you can be at
peace with

They ride into the city past the troops

EXT KHOR KHALBA CITY - ENTRANCE DAY

Conan and Tamara walk through the town’s teeming market
which ends at the sheer cliff wall at the bottom of the
mesa

There is a WOODEN PLATFORM that is lowered by a massive
winch unloading a cavalry regiment and then raising back
up to the fortress above

CONAN
The platform is the only way into
Khalar’s fortress I’m sure it is heavily
guarded at all times day and night

TAMARA
So we must try to scale the cliff

CONAN
And dodge arrows as we do so

Conan motions up to the winch Standing beside it are a
half dozen of the four-armed ARCHERS

CONAN (CONTD)
During the day we’d easily be spotted on
the climb And it would be useless to
even attempt at night No Crom’s
strength does us little good here We
must rely on his cunning

INT KHOR KHALBA MARKET - AFTERNOON

Conan walks up to a street VENDOR purchasing some kind
of grilled serpent on a stick Tamara is speechless as he
goes to another vendor and buys a loaf of brad

TAMARA
This This is your plan Eating

CONAN
Why not Better to die on a full stomach

Conan’s coin purse slips from his grasp a handful of
gold coins spilling on the dirt floor Several eyes on
the street take careful note as Conan scoops them up

TAMARA
I can’t believe I shared my bed with a
oeaf such as you

And as they argue a hand reaches behind Conan snatching
the coin purse from his belt

CONAN
(quietly)
Did he take it

TAMARA
(quietly)
Yes Now give me some of that bread

EXT KHOR KHALBA - ALLEY

A THIEF carrying Conan’s purse scurries down a dark
alley Stopping at a black door he looks left and right
making sure no one is around to witness

Then he knocks at the door Five knocks Pause Three
knocks Pause Two knocks

And a second later Conan drops from above knocking him
out with a single punch and throwing his body aside--

Just as the door opens another THIEF stands on the other
side eyeing Conan up

THIEF
I’d know if my eyes had seen you before
I think you have found the wrong door

CONAN
You’re wrong I seek a door without a
lock

A glimmer of recognition in the Thief’‘s eye The code

THIEF
There is always a lock

CONAN
Then there is always a way for a thief
in need

THIEF
So you know the words of the Thieves’
Guild What’s your business

CONAN
That’s for your Guildmaster only

INT THIEVES’ GUILD HALL -— NIGHT

A rundown hall built beneath the city Wooden supports
hold up the buildings of the entire city block overhead

And within the hall a gathering of THIEVES and ROGUES
They’re a flinty collection many of them missing fingers
or even hands evidence of Khalar’s cruel justice

They eat and drink sharing tales and tips their
cautious eyes following the Cimmerian outsider

Conan is led to the head table where the elderly
GUILDMASTER sits flanked by lithe tattooed WOMEN The
Guildmaster bears the wounds of his trade his arms are
lined with lash marks his nose crushed from soldiers’

fists

THIEF
Guildmaster a brother from afar in need
of counsel

The Guildmaster takes in Conan as he puffs from a hashish

pipe

GUILDMASTER
He looks too big to be a thief What is
it we can do for a fellow craftsman
travelling here

CONAN
I want your help to kill Khalar Singh

The Guildmaster CHOKES spitting smoke and spit He
stares at Conan realizing he’s serious And then he
LAUGHS A deep booming laugh

GUILDMASTER
I’m afraid we have no madhouse friend
and so I can be of no assistance--

CONAN
I just need a way into the fortress
Surely the guild knows of one

GUILDMASTER
Why would we want to assist you

CONAN
I have seen Guild halls from Nemedia to
Kush and back again Yours is the
poorest Your thieves are thin and
scared

GUILDMASTER
You think insulting us will get you what
you want

CONAN
T think that a truth so plain cannot ba
an insult A city like this should be
yours for the taking Your mead glasses
should be full your coffers overflowing
with gold and jewels

(MORE )

CONAN (CONTD)
And here I offer to take Khalar’s boot
from your neck for nothing How can you
not accept

Many in the hall respond to Conan’s words with approval
and even the wary Guildmaster’s eyes sparkle But old
habits die hard and the aged thief is still cautious

GUILDMASTER
Even if we did know of a way into the
fortress it would be folly to share it
with you Were you to be captured you
would bring all manner of hells upon us

CONAN
I will not be taken alive Either I will
kill Khalar Singh or I will die in the
attempt

The Guildmaster chews his lip thinking

GUILDMASTER
Are you really that good

SMASH With lightning speed Conan’s sword flashes and
the table before the Guildmaster is split in two

The tip of Conan’s sword hovers just an inch from the
Guildmaster’s face

CONAN
I am Cimmerian It is enough

cuUT TO

INT GUILD HALL -— BACK ROOM - NIGHT

The room is filled with huge WINE CASKS The Guildmaster
and his two women lead Conan in

GUILDMASTER
Each night provisions are brought to the
Fortress Three casks of wine Ten crates
of meat and other food Tonight this
cask will be switched for one of the
others

The women press on a hidden part of the cask and it
SPLITS OPEN revealing a hidden chamber inside

CONAN
How will you switch the casks

GUILDMASTER
Leave that to us Do we have a deal

CONAN
We do There is one I must bring with me

The Guildmaster nods and Tamara is escorted in

GUILDMASTER
We found her spying on the entrance you
used

Conan laughs

CUT TO

EXT PROVISIONS WAGONS NIGHT

A long line of wagons carrying casks and foodstuffs wind
their way through a city bazaar flanked on all sides by
Khalar’s soldiers

We spot familiar faces in the bazaar crowd thieves from
the guild hall They exchange nods as the wagons near

Suddenly a FIGHT breaks out between several thieves The
fight instantly spills over to the caravan and the
soldiers leap into the fray throwing the thieves clear
of the wagons

Above and unseen two thieves swing the large cask onto
the wagon containing the others They untie it and in
seconds tie another cask to their rope

THIEF
Luck to you brother

They swing back into the bazaar but as they push off
they accidently make a slight crack in the cask beneath
them

A SLOW DRIP OF WINE falls to the wagon

The soldiers repel the brawlers and the wagons continue
on their way

INT CASK - NIGHT

Conan and Tamara sit in the darkness Conan finds

Tamara’s hand reaching out for his own He clasps it
tightly

EXT BASE OF THE CLIFF NIGHT

The wagon is unloaded onto to the platform along with
some of the SOLDIERS One of soldiers yells up to the top
of the cliff

SOLDIER
All set Raise the platform

The platform slowly rises

EXT THE WINCH - NIGHT

A massive winch that controls the platform thirty feet
in diameter is manned by twelve of the largest men you
will ever see Overseeing them is a LIEUTENANT

The men work as one pushing the massive wheel that
raises the foot-thick ropes suspending the platform
EXT THE WINCH — NIGHT

The huge men struggle and strain as they move the giant
wheel hauling the huge cargo skyward

EXT THE PLATFORM - NIGHT

As the platform rises the soldiers relax

And then one of the soldiers spots something dripping
Wine from the cracked cask

SOLDIER 1
Sergeant

The SERGEANT comes over and sees it too

SERGEANT
Seal it
(to the soldiers)
Check the other casks for leaks

The soldiers fan out searching the casks looking for
leaks-—

But one starts tapping on them making sure they are
full Tap-tap Tap-tap TAP-—TAP

The soldier freezes noticing the hollow sound He stares
at the cask long and hard

The Sergeant notices his behavior He comes up but the
soldier puts his hand in the air He points at the
suspect cask and silently draws his sword

The soldiers surround the cask and do the same The
Sergeant gets their eyes and silently counts down with
his fingers

THREE The soldiers raise their swords advancing close
enough to strike

TWO The soldier who discovered the suspect cask lines
his sword up with a crack running the length of the cask
drawing back to strike

ONE THE SIDE OF THE CASK EXPLODES OUTWARDS AS CONAN’S
SWORD SHATTERS THE WOOD AND JABS RIGHT THROUGH THE NECK
OF THE FIRST SOLDIER

Conan kicks the casks sending a thousand pounds rolling
down on the soldiers’ heads Most of the soldiers are
knocked clear off the platform in one move

THE WINCH - INTERCUT

Tamara looks up but the soldiers manning the winch
haven’t noticed them yet

THE PLATFORM — INTERCUT

Conan drops his sword and grabs the remaining two by
their collars and flings them over his shoulder They
clear the edge of the platform by five feet SCREAMING as
they fall to their death

THE WINCH - INTERCUT

The Lieutenant hears the screams and glances down only
to see his fellow soldiers dead and dying

LIEUTENANT
(to the winch haulers)
Stop the winch
CONAN

Glares up at the Lieutenant as the platform stops moving
halfway between the ground and the fortress

LIEUTENANT (CONT’D)
Archers

TAMARA

Looks around There’s no way down and a long climb up
the ropes to get up

TAMARA
Climb the ropes

CONAN
Certain death from the archers

And on cue the ARCHERS arrive The same four-armed
archers we saw earlier They draw their bows and unleash
a hail of death

Conan pulls Tamara to him and swings his sword overhead
knocking the arrows out of the sky

The archers just notch another volley

CONAN (CONTD)
Under the wagons go

Tamara and Conan run diving under the wagons as another
volley of arrows imbed themselves in the platform

TAMARA
What now

Conan looks around the platform which now sways on the
support rope Conan leaves her running to the far end of
the platform

The Archers are waiting They open fire Conan dives and
runs right back to the wagons

TAMARA (CONT’D)
What are you doing

CONAN
Building speed

Conan rushes out again Arrows fly towards him but miss
then he runs back under the wagon

Tamara sees what is happening As the platform’s arc
increases it draws closer to the bottom edges of the
fortress

TAMARA
You really think we can reach it

ABOVE

The archers clear away as CAULDRONS OF BURNING OIL are
heaved to the edge of the winch platform The soldiers
manning them calculate their timing then release the
burning oil

BELOW

Conan and Tamara run unimpeded forcing the momentum of
the platform as fast as they can

Suddenly their efforts are brightly lit Conan looks up

CONAN
Cover

He grabs Tamara and leaps for the wagons They make it
under just as a wave of burning oil splashes over most of
the platform

In moments nearly everything is aflame

Conan readies himself for another run Tamara grabs him

TAMARA
You can’t Its death

CONAN
It’s death to stay here The ropes

Tamara turns to see one of the ropes has already burned
through several strands The platform is now suspended by
a single strand itself on fire

CONAN (CONT’D)
Come We are leaving

Tamara rushes into the flames with him They run to the
far side of the platform only to see it collapse beneath
their feet and fall

They pull themselves up and race to the other side as the
platform races down the arc and up the other side

SNAP The rope gives way

CONAN (CONTD)
Jump

Tamara and Conan reach the far end of the platform and
use its momentum to be launched into the air They fly up
towards the bottom of the fortress where it is fused
with the rock of the cliff

Conan jams his hand into the only handhold he can see
smashing the rock as he does so

His other hand lashes out and catches Tamara as she
starts to fall

And beneath them the platform disintegrates and plummets
to earth in a fireball

EXT WINCH NIGHT

The soldiers watch the fiery platform drop with
satisfaction

INT DUNGEON - NIGHT

Carved out of solid black rock both sides of the broad
corridor are occasionally punctuated by thick steel
doors leading to prison cells

As Conan and Tamara emerge from a storm drain pushing
their way to the floor of the hallway The heavy darkness
presses in on Conan’s torch like a sentient animate
thing

The floor of the corridor is lined with DEAD BODIES in
varying states of decay There are buckets filled with
entrails and feces upended Tamara put her hand over her
mouth

TAMARA
This prison reeks of the dead

CONAN
I imagine they are the fortunate ones
here

Conan continues down the hallway He and Tamara begin to
hear the sound of JANGLING CHAINS

Just ahead the corridors opens out into

INT DUNGEON - CIRCULAR CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

The same chamber we saw before with the well full of
black worms in the middle and the prisoners suspended on
the walls above in a web of chains

Conan lifts the torch higher struggling to make out
their faces Most are too weak to even cry out those
that do have voices HOARSE from dehydration

Tamara spots two faces she recognizes two girls ILIRA
and ZARA

TAMARA
Tlira Zara

There’s a loud BOOM as an iron door nearby opens and
CLOSES Conan grabs Tamara and they slide back into the
darkened corridor

Stepping into the chamber comes striding
THE JAILER

Standing nearly seven feet tall thick chains crisscross
the full course of his heavyset ebony body Flies swarm
over his filthy form but he pays them little heed

THE JAILER
Greetings my lovelies

He passes right by the spot where Conan and Tamara hide
They sneak past him down the hall he came from

Conan can see stairs leading up

CONAN
(whispering)
I promised you entry here Khalar Singh
awaits my blade

Tamara stares at him then the Jailer She can only nod
in resignation Conan starts for the stairs-—-

THE JAILER
(to the prisoners)
My sweet reeds Are you prepared to play
for your master

The Jailer takes two of the chains from his body and
attaches them to the web of chains lining the walls

Using the full strength of his enormous frame he PULLS
ON THE CHAINS stretching the limbs of the prisoners

The Prisoners GROAN and HOWL in pain as their bodies are
pulled taut The Jailer grins BELLOWING in laughter

THE JAILER (CONT’D)
Howl Cry Moan What instrument could
ever match the Jailer’s chorus

Conan freezes hearing the suffering

The Jailer pulls even harder the cries of the prisoners
rising to a crescendo

TAMARA

Shakes in hatred and fear She lifts her sword trembling
as she does so and prepares to strike-

Until a hand comes in and lowers her sword for her
CONAN

Rage is in his eyes as well He holds up a hand to
Tamara Wait here

Conan loudly unsheathes his sword stepping into the
light

THE JAILER (CONT’D)
Who dares

Conan menacingly drags the tip of his sword on the stone
floor his eyes filled with rage

CONAN
I’ll show you a new tune dog Come

The Jailer unhooks his chains from the ones on the walls
and with surprising speed he spins and HURLS them across
the room at Conan

CONAN’S POV SLOW MOTION

Conan sees the chains as they unfurl like the scales of a
serpent rolling end over end towards him

CONAN

Ducks underneath the chains time speeding back up as he
leaps towards the Jailer Conan slashes the behemoth
directly in his gut but SPARKS FLY as the thick chains
covering the Jailer’s body deflect the strike

THE JAILER
You’1l soon be singing in my chorus
warrior And she’ll be singing as well
in my bedchamber

Tamara wants to join the battle but Conan waves her off
He circles The Jailer eyes probing for a weak point in
his armor of chains

Conan lunges slicing horizontally cutting between two
of the great links of chain covering the Jailer‘’s body
The Jailer HOWLS in pain but also manages to swing one
of his chains around Conan’s sword wrist

The Jailer YANKS BACK and Conan’s sword goes flying from
his hand It lands far across the room

THE JAILER (CONT’D)
Try and pray to your gods boy But soon
you realize they’ve deserted you here

The Jailer wraps one of his chains around a SPIKED BALL
on the floor The ball is massive and made of solid
metal but the Jailer easily lifts it swinging it like a
ball and chain mace

The air around the spinning spiked ball WHISTLES as it
picks up momentum Conan dives around the Jailer’s first
strike the metal ball CRUSHING THE WALL behind him

Again the Jailer swings the ball around his body and
this time Conan isn’t quick enough Even though he’s just
grazed by the ball the impact sends him careening into
the stone wall

A moment later the Jailer is before him swinging down
for the kill Conan rolls out of the way but the Jailer
reaches down with his free hand wrapping his meaty
fingers around Conan’s neck

The Jailer LIFTS Conan into the air throttling him
Conan’s feet dangle his hands struggling to loose the
Jailer’s grip The world around Conan begins to swim as
he begins to pass out

THE JAILER (CONT’D)
I’‘ll give you this you’ve been a
challenge warrior Now let death’s sweet
embrace take you away from your struggle

Conan responds by swinging his legs shoving off the
Jailer’s massive belly and then swinging like a pendulum
until his legs wrap around the Jailer’s neck

The two powerful men throttle each other but The Jailer
gives up first taking his hands from around Conan’s neck
to try and pull Conan’s clenched legs from around his
neck

Conan uses the opportunity to swing up and behind the
Jailer ending up on the man’s back Conan grabs hold of
the heavy links of chain and pulls back with all his
strength

The chains wrap around the Jailer’s neck choking him
Try as he might the huge man can’t get Conan off his
back nor can he stop the chains from cutting off his
air

Conan unwraps the chains when he body goes limp letting
it fall into the well in the center of the room The
Jailer’s eyes flutter open as the worms begin burrowing
into his skin

And now it is his turn to SCREAM

Tamara and Conan work together to pull the female monks
down from the chains Quietly they cry as Tamara hugs
each and every one of them

TAMARA
Sssh No crying We will find a way and
leave this place

Tamara sees torchlight flickering from a cell nearby She
heads that direction

INT DARKENED CELL - NIGHT

As the steel door open rats scurry in the windowless
cell A single torch flickers by the cell’s iron gate

A MAN is there kneeling on the floor face down A robe
hangs off his shoulders in tatters

TAMARA
Fassir

The man looks up It’s FASSIR though a pale imitation
of the man we met earlier

FASSIR
(straining to see)
Tamara Is that you
Tamara runs to Fassir helping to bring him to his

Her eyes are filled with tears of joy
TAMARA
Tt’s me It’s Tamara I’ve come to get
you out of here

FASSIR

Foolish child You’re more valuable than

these old bones

TAMARA
If you were trapped beyond the gates of
hell I’d find you

feet

Tamara helps Fassir towards the door But when she turns
to head back down the hallway they came they see Conan

standing at the foot of the stairway leading up

CONAN
Use the chains to get out They will be
long enough to make it down the cliff
face

TAMARA
And the archers

Conan tighten the cords on his bracers
CONAN
You’1l be the least of their problems
soon enough
Fassir squints to make out Conan’s form
FASSIR
You are the Cimmerian I’ve heard them
speak of you Khalar knows you are
coming
Tamara takes a step towards Conan
TAMARA
Come with us now We’ll get Khalar
together another day

CONAN
My ghosts die tonight

With one last look Conan is gone

INT DUNGEON - CIRCULAR CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

Tamara walks back into the chamber where the female
monks have released the last of their brethren and are
helping the weakened women to their feet

TAMARA
Gather the chains sisters Freedom is at
hand

But when the monks look back at Tamara they recoil in
HORROR

TAMARA (CONTD)
What--what’s wrong

SUDDENLY THE CHAINS SPRING TO LIFE SLAMMING THE WOMEN
BACK AGAINST THE WALL AND ENSNARING THEM

Only then Tamara realizes they weren’t looking at her
but behind her AT FASSIR

FASSIR

Tamara turns to see Fassir menacingly grinning as he
chants under his breath He now appears fully healthy
the illusion of his illness dispelled

TAMARA (CONT’D)
Fassir--no Not you--

The chains race for Tamara engulfing her

EXT FORTRESS - NIGHT

A SENTRY stands guard beside a courtyard wall The
shadowy form of Conan silently leaps down beside the
Sentry

There’s barely a sound as Conan slices his throat and in
one swift move relieves the falling Sentry of his cape
and helmet

INT FORTRESS - HALLWAY NIGHT

A pair of torches hang beside the entrance to Khalar’s
throne room

Conan walks up to the doorway at the last moment
unsheathing his sword and SLICING the air across the
doorway

A pair of SHADOW SCOUTS unseen by us materialize as
they fall dead on either side of the doorway

INT FORTRESS - THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

The throne room is empty scattered light barely
illuminating the expansive chamber

Khalar Singh sits on his throne his thoughts seemingly
elsewhere

Khalar looks up just as Conan slips out of the shadows
sword in his hand

KHALAR SINGH
Wait--

Conan thrusts the blade deep into Khalar’s chest The
stricken man looks at Conan with a sad almost bewildered
look then slumps over

Conan stands over his dead enemy rare emotions swirling
across his face

BAEL Almost too easy wasn’t it

BAEL

Stands on the balcony of the upper gallery directly
above Conan

BAEL (CONT’D)
Fassir told you Khalar was waiting
Perhaps you should have listened Now
look what you’ve done

Conan looks down at the body slumped on the throne IT NO
LONGER LOOKS ANYTHING LIKE KHALAR

A DEAD GIRL

Conan looks closer at dead body It’s a woman with long
dark hair obscuring her face hair just like--

CONAN
Tamara

Conan lifts up the dead woman’s head her hair slowly
parting to revealZARA one of Tamara’s friends last
seen in the prison

CONAN (CONT‘D)
Where is she

BAEL
Tamara is headed home Khalar Singh takes
her to the lost city of Acheron

CONAN
You lie

UKAFA He does not

Conan turns to see Ukafa standing in throne room on his
level armed with his war spear Ukafa’s frightening
sharpened teeth shine as he smiles

UKAFA (CONTD)
They are being lowered on a new platform
as we speak If you hurry you might
catch them
(smiles)
All you need to do is get past me

Conan responds by lunging forward swinging his sword in
a broad arc Ukafa is just as quick stepping back and
allowing his spear to block the swing

Ukafa whirls the war spear in great circles forcing
Conan to parry stepping back beyond the spear’s reach

The two powerful warriors trade blows back and forth
neither able to gain the advantage

Ukafa tries to spear Conan through the chest and Conan
decides to drop his sword grabbing the spear as it
passes by him

Conan then pulls on the spear throwing Ukafa off his
balance towards Conan Conan then kicks the warrior in
the chest hurtling Ukafa backwards

Now Conan turns the spear on its master Ukafa unarmed
is forced to backpedal as Conan thrusts the spear at him
A pair of close misses leaves Ukafa with gashes on his
chest and arm

Another kick to the chest sends Ukafa flying out the
chamber

EXT CLOISTER NIGHT

Ukafa tumbles to the stone floor Conan leaps out
readying the spear to finish the job

Several SOLDIERS appear ready to aid Ukafa He waves
them off

UKAFA
He’s mine We are each the last of our
people Cimmerian Yours dies tonight

Conan circles the unarmed Ukafa waving the tribesman’s
spear like a serpent’s tongue preparing to strike

Conan lunges but Ukafa is too quick Ukafa grabs the
spear and rolls back throwing Conan headfirst into the
air

Conan CRASHES onto a wooden grate in the cloister floor
Ukafa thrusts at him again Conan grabs the spear
pulling Ukafa down onto the grate as well

The weight of the two men breaks the grate and they
plummet into the darkness below

INT SEWER - NIGHT

Conan and Ukafa impact the soft surface below splattered
with a red liquid

As Conan struggles to stand he can see he’s nearly
covered in blood but not his own He’s landed upon a
PILE OF BODIES blood clotting their monks robes

It’s the dead forms of Tamara’s people every one of them
massacred and thrown here to rot

UKAFA
Worry not barbarian Your body won’t be
left to rot down here My people feast on
the flesh of great warriors absorbing
their spirit

Again we see a flash of Ukafa’s filed down teeth Ukafa
lunges for Conan with the spear but Conan dives out of
the way and the spear lodges itself deep into a monk’s
corpse

Before Ukafa can pull it out Conan kicks him in the
chest

Ukafa falls backwards upon a pile of dead bodies blood
SQUIRTING up as his heavy frame crushes corpses beneath
him

The battle goes to hand-to-hand It’s primal each of
them covered in blood Ukafa resorts to using his teeth
to bite into Conan’s shoulder

Conan YELLS IN PAIN He HEAD BUTTS Ukafa smashing the
side of his head in and knocking him back

The stunned Ukafa falls to his knees and one of the
monks REACHES OUT FOR HIM They’re NOT ALL DEAD

Conan takes advantage of Ukafa’s surprise to grab the
spear He charges Ukafa just as Ukafa finds Conan’s
sword raising it to receive the charge

Frenzy fills both warriors’ eyes as they collide

CUT TO

INT FORTRESS - LIBRARY - NIGHT

Bael hurries collecting some last scrolls and placing
them into his travelling bag He hears a footsteps
outside his door

BAEL
Who’s there

SMASH The door splinters inward revealing Conan still
very much alive Bael soon finds Conan’s sword at his
throat

CONAN
Where is this place Acheron

BAEL
In the mountains not far from here But
you’ll never get out of the fortress
alive

CONAN
I will Because you will help me

EXT FORTRESS - GATE - NIGHT

Bael rolls a BARREL slowly towards the soldiers gathered
around the platform and winch He’s got a rope tied
around his waist (with the rest of it trailing behind
him) and his eyes betray the total terror he feels

When he gets close--

SOLDIER 1
What do you have there

BAEL
Mead

SOLDIER 1
Then what are you waiting for bring it
here

The soldiers help Bael pull it over to the platform and
one pierces the top of it with his sword

A strange look crosses the soldier’s face

SOLDIER 1 (CONT’D)
Why do you have that rope around you

SOLDIER 2
This isn’t mead It smells like--oil

Bael’s eyes go wide as the soldiers draw their swords

Over his head a TORCH flies landing right on the open
oil barrel

FOOOMP The oil barrel explodes sending flames in every
direction

Before the flames reach Bael the rope around his waist
draws tight pulling him twenty feet backwards and
nearly breaking his back in the process

Conan steps forward surveying the burning soldiers and
watching as the platform plummets to the ground--for the
second time today

CONAN
Come We are leaving

The few remaining soldiers race to face Conan His face
stays impassive as he cuts them down before they even get
within arms’ reach

He heads to the

WINCH

Conan grabs the burning end of the rope putting the
flames out and tying the rope around Bael to it

CONAN (CONTD)
Come little monk Time to leave

BAEL
How You’ve destroyed the--

Conan pushes him off the edge of the fortress jumping
with him

The winch unwinds quickly as Conan and Bael fall

EXT MIDAIR

Bael SCREAMS as they plummet towards the ground below
Conan pays him no mind

WINCH

When the winch reaches the end of the rope it jerks to a
halt

EXT KHOR KALBA BASE OF THE CLIFF - NIGHT

Conan and Bael suddenly jerk to a halt just a few feet
above the ground Bael gets the wind knocked out of him
but Conan simply lets go of the rope and lands on his
feet

He cuts Bael down and drags him off

EXT MOUNTAINOUS PATH JUST BEFORE DAWN

Khalar Singh’s retinue slows to a crawl as they enter
deep stone canyons Cliffs rise on all sides as do
natural stone pillars It is an eerie place a low fog
rolling over everything

Khalar Singh stops The caravan behind him does as well

KHALAR SINGH
Bring me the girl

Soldiers unlock the carriage and drag Tamara to Khalar
Singh Tamara seems unusually subdued almost docile
Fassir exits the carriage as well

KHALAR SINGH (CONT’D)
Not much fight in her

FASSIR
The black lotus does its work well She
is aware of what is happening but only
as an observer to her own fate Why have
we stopped

KHALAR SINGH
I am glad to see you don’t know
everything Fassir We are at the great
city of Acheron

Fassir looks around at the rock and dirt canyons There’s
nothing here

FASSIR
This place is empty

KHALAR SINGH
Empty You see only with your eyes

Khalar Singh simply smiles and in a flash draws his
sword and delivers a CUT to Tamara’s hand

A SINGLE DROP OF HER BLOOD FALLS--—

AND THE FOG COMES ALIVE SWIRLING AROUND THE SINGLE DROP
OF BLOOD AND RACING OVER THE CLIFFS REVEALING-—

EXT ACHERON - DAWN

The topology is the same but where we saw cliffs we now
see huge walls where there were hills now ziggurats
And where there were stone pillars now are two hundred
foot tall purple marble statues to malevolent and
forgotten gods

And with the swirling fog come VOICES-gutteral angry
insistent They speak in tongues both foreign and
familiar

Khalar Singh’s men are more than a little unnerved by
what they see Only Fassir shares his grin

FASSIR
The voices of Acheron They call out for
her blood

Khalar nods to the men holding Tamara

KHALAR SINGH
They’ve waited long enough for their
vengeance Prepare her in the Great
Temple

Khalar’s men take Tamara forward down what has now
become blood red boulevards leading towards a massive
ziggurat of skulls in the center of the city

Everywhere Tamara goes TORCHES IGNITE burning with an
eerie spectral blue flame

KHALAR SINGH (CONT’D)
I want a legion in every direction
Nothing enters or leaves until the
sacrifice is complete

The army COMMANDERS nod and head off to arrange their
troops

EXT MOUNTAIN PASS - DAWN

Conan forces Bael along the thin mountain pass Conan
spots the FLICKERING of the blue light from the torches

CONAN
What is that

BAEL
Acheron
(smiles)
You are too late Northerner The ghosts
of Acheron have awoken You cannot stop
it now

CONAN
My sword says otherwise

BAEL
The Queen has brought the power of
Acheron back to its home Khalar Singh
will claim it as his own

CONAN
Not if I kill him first

BAEL
Then the power will remain inside the
Queen Either way it will birth a new
Acheron

Conan frustrated grabs Bael pinning the smaller man by
his throat Bael necks looks ready to snap

CONAN
There must be another way

BAEL
There is---one
(Conan eases off)
You could kill her

Conan lets Bael go Bael glares at him

BAEL (CONTD)
What does your sword say about that

INT GREAT TEMPLE RITUAL BATH - LATER

A torch lined crypt dominated by a serpentine sunken
pool Several of Khalar’s PRIESTS stand there softly

chanting incantations A large contingent of SOLDIERS

examine the strange and eerie space

FASSIR
For the purification we must bathe her
in the pool

SOLDIER
But the pool is empty

FASSIR
No longer

Suddenly the priests strike as one curved black daggers
jabbing into the necks of the flatfooted soldiers They
lay their bodies down as their lifeblood pours into the
bath slowly filling it

Tamara watches her eyes rolled towards the back of her
head She struggles to move away as Fassir releases a
clasp and her robe falls from her body leaving her
naked

FASSIR (CONTD)
Time to enter the pool my dear Purify
yourself in the blood of the fallen

Fassir lifts Tamara taking her into the blood pool
TAMARA

(trying to speak)
Wh--why

FASSIR
I am dying I knew only one power in the
world that could save me You But since
I raised you from a child I also knew
you would be unwilling to sacrifice
others to unleash that power So I turned
to Khalar Singh I could have taken your
power for myself--but even my hypocrisy
has its bounds

TAMARA
You betrayed your people

Fassir lowers Tamara’s body into the pool of blood
cradling her upon the surface as if she were a baby

FASSIR
This is our true home These are our
people Those nightmares you had so
often They were your true nature
calling you back here What you call
betrayal I call reunion

Tamara can only watch in horror as Fassir sinks her into
the pool the red tide enveloping her features as if she
were drowning in blood

EXT ACHERON - LATER

Conan looks down upon the expansive city from the same
cliff-side vantage as Khalar Singh once did Bael gapes
at the massive towers in the canyon below

BAEL
At last Acheron has returned

CONAN
Get a closer look

Conan pushes Bael over the cliff Bael SCREAMS as he
plummets
EXT ACHERON - BOULEVARD -— CONTINUOUS

A large contingent of Khalar Singh’s troops rush off in
the direction of the scream

CONAN

Sweat pours off his face as he strains

THE SOLDIERS
find the body of Bael at the base of the cliff
CONAN

YELLS as his muscles reach the breaking point but they
begin to move Conan pushes a HUGE BOULDER off its perch
rolling it towards the cliff

THE SOLDIERS

Look above searching for the source of the yelling when
a massive boulder blots out the light

SLAM It lands like an artillery shell killing ten of
the soldiers at impact and the splintering shower of
rocks shooting forth and slaying the rest

EXT PYRAMID - DAWN

The massive pyramid of skulls is lit from the interior by
torchlight Soft beams of light flicker out from the
hollow sockets of the Acheronian victims

KHALAR SINGH

The warlord stands at the top of the great pyramid The
top is separated into two parts on one end a massive
golden throne on the other a sacrificial altar

Khalar Singh sits on the throne holding open the box
with the single BLACK WORM The worm squirms its
intensity noticeably greater

KHALAR SINGH
You’ve led me here Now we finish this
together

Khalar places the worm against his arm It BURROWS IN
moving beneath his flesh towards his head Khalar’s eyes
widen in pain but he bears his burden silently

KHALAR’S EYES

The white orbs slowly change to black as if ink were
dropped into pool of water His voice stammers a bit
eracked with suffering

KHALAR SINGH (CONT’D)
Begin the incantations Take the girl to
the altar
EXT ACHERON BOULEVARD - DAWN

More soldiers find the dead ones and the destruction of
the boulder

SOLDIER 1
By the gods

CONAN (0S)
No By me

The soldiers spin a moment too late Conan emerges from
behind the boulder and swings wide his blade neatly
drawing across the throats of all four soldiers dropping
them instantly

Conan steps out into the wider boulevard

The pyramid looms in the distance fifty of Khalar’s
SOLDIERS standing between him and it

CONAN (CONT’D)
Fifty between me and my prize So be it

BATTLE MONTAGE

- The PIKEMEN rush Conan in a phalanx only to see Conan
roll under their long weapons and cut through the poles
with one sweep of his sword A second swing cuts them
down

- The SWORD AND SHIELD units approach as an armored wall
Conan rushes the lead shield leaping into the air and
drop-kicking him back twenty feet When Conan lands he’s
behind them They try to strike and shift their shields
but they are too late

- The DUAL SWORDSMEN give Conan more trouble Whirling
blades in a dizzying attack are parried by Conan but
they do force him back until he sees the pattern in
their motions and lunges forward inside their defenses
stabbing them in their necks

EXT ACHERON - PYRAMID - CONTINUOUS

Tamara dressed in finery fit for an Acheronian princess
is led towards the pyramid of skulls by Fassir and his
priests

As they climb the ghostly spirits of Acheron swirl
around Tamara The CHANTING of the priests suddenly
increases in volume drowning out all other sounds

Purple smoke from the braziers atop the pyramid fills the
air obscuring everything else

FASSIR
This is your destiny Your death will
again give life to the greatest
civilization the world has ever known

Tamara uses every ounce of energy to spit her words at
Khalar

TAMARA
T--will--not--birth--it I--will--burn--
it

FASSIR

How Cimmerian of you

CONAN

- Conan reaches the steps of the massive pyramid He can
see Tamara reaching the top only to be surrounded by the
purple smoke

- But a paix of the BLACK RIVER ARCHERS stand halfway up
They unleash a barrage of arrows in Conan’s direction

- Conan ducks down pulling one of the dead soldier’s
shields up to absorb the arrows As he runs forward a
half dozen arrows bury themselves into the shield A
moment later he tosses the circular shield like a
frisbee

- One of the archers takes the shield to the face and
goes down The other goes to fire when he spots Conan
bearing down upon him teeth bared Conan’s sword lashes
out just as the archer notches his bow---

CUT TO

EXT TOP OF THE PYRAMID CONTINUOUS

The CHANTING is deafening Surrounding the priests’ words
are the echoes of a thousand demons

Khalar Singh stands the worm rippling beneath his skin

KHALAR SINGH
Begin the rite

FASSIR
Chain her to the altar

The priests do as they are told Golden shackles attach
to Tamara’s wrists and ankles The altar she lays on is
made of black obsidian covered in runes and deep
channels for the collection of sacrificial blood

Tamara’s body writhes on the altar her head whipping
from side to side her mind possessed Her eyes go as
black as Khalar Singhs

As she writhes the purple smoke swirls faster and
faster until it is not unlike the sandstorm around the
oasis

FASSIR (CONT’D)
She is transforming

KHALAR SINGH
Then finish it before it is too late

FASSIR

Mighty gods of Acheron for so long have

you slept Accept this sacrifice of your

betrayer and grant us your power
Fassir produces a familiar RUBY DAGGER looking just like
the one Simura had He holds it over Tamara’s bare
stomach
But behind everyone--
CONAN
Steps through the swirling smoke Covered in the blood of
his enemies eyes wild with combat fury he looks like a
demon possessed
And Khalar Singh’s back is to him He raises the sword

Fassir raises the dagger

Conan stands right behind Khalar Singh With the
cacophony of the chanting no one hears him approach

But Conan sees Fassir about to strike Hesitation fills
his face
lll

CONAN
STOP

Everyone turns to see Conan behind Khalar his blade at
his mortal enemy’s neck

Everyone freezes

CONAN (CONT’D)
Release the girl

The priests around Tamara begin to falter in their
chanting

KHALAR SINGH
No Continue the ritual

The priests keep the chanting going Tamara’s head turns
toward Conan and her eyes revert to normal for a moment
as if his face has pulled her from a trance

TAMARA
Conan

KHALAR SINGH
Your blade is at my throat Cimmerian
Isn’t this the moment you’ve waited your
entire life for You would sacrifice
that for her

CONAN
I will not tell you again Release the
girl

KHALAR SINGH
Lower your blade and I will have Fassir
lower his

Warily Conan lowers his sword from Khalar Singh’s
throat When his sword arm passes near Khalar’s hand
KHALAR GRABS HIS ARM-—

AND THE BLACK WORM RACES OUT OF KHALAR’S BODY AND INVADES
CONANS

Conan ROARS in agony as the black worm courses through
his body He falls to the ground his sword clattering
away from him

TAMARA’S

eyes revert to black as her face contorts into a mask of
fury The swirling smoke begins to howl faces of demons
appearing in the maelstrom

Khalar Singh LAUGHS

KHALAR SINGH (CONT’D)

How sad to pursue something with so
singular a purpose only to discover at
the last moment you cannot make the
necessary sacrifice I assure you I will
not make the same mistake

(to Fassir)
Kill her

FASSIR

raises the ruby blade to strike when Tamara’s black eyes
turn on him Fassir shakes standing there frozen

KHALAR SINGH (CONT’D)
Strike Strike you fool

Fassir’s whole body shudders but he does not strike

TAMARA
(in an other-worldly voice)
Traitor

And suddenly Fassir bursts into flames He drops the
blade which clatters to the floor He runs screaming
looking for help Instead he finds the maelstrom of
purple smoke which simply fans his flames until his body
collapses in a burning heap

CONAN’S BODY

contorts in agony as the worm races inside him He stares
down at his hand trying to will it to reach for the
sword but whenever it gets close the worm causes it to
convulse

KHALAR SINGH

Strides over to the ruby blade

TAMARA (CONTD)
Now you burn as well

She stares at Khalar Singh who doesn’t seem the least
bit afraid

KHALAR SINGH
IT have communed with the Dark Ones Your
power has no effect on me While I on
the other hand--

Khalar picks up the ruby blade smiling
CONAN

Sees what is about to happen He grits his teeth even as
he’s wracked with another spasm of agony He stares at
his trembling hand

It obeys him It reaches out and grabs the pommel of his
sword

But he doesn’t try and turn it on Khalar Singh He
doesn’t try to stand

Instead he turns it on himself He waits watching the
evil worm racing beneath his skin and when it crosses
his stomach--

CONAN STABS HIMSELF WITH HIS OWN SWORD
The Worm SHRIEKS A direct hit Conan pulls the blade
out the worm thrashing but impaled on it He smashes it
against the stone floor cutting it in half and killing
it
KHALAR SINGH
Stands before the Altar ruby blade in hand
KHALAR SINGH (CONT’D)

Mighty gods of Acheron for so long have

you slept--
CONAN

Slowly---painfully--he RISES His face is ashen his gut
bleeding profusely but we know that look in his eye
This is far from over

KHALAR SINGH (CONT’D)
Accept this sacrifice of your betrayer
and grant us you power

Khalar Singh strikes with the blade

CLANG Instead of killing Tamara it impacts Conan’s
outstretched sword
With the flick of a wrist Conan disarms Khalar Singh
knocking the blade over by the throne

But it does give Khalar Singh time to draw his Tulwars
CONAN AND KHALAR

The battle is a study in opposites Khalar’s style is
both fluid and studied while Conan is raw power and
natural agility

But Conan is wounded and therefore slower Khalar Singh
slashes him across the chest dropping Conan to one knee

Conan fights back with a two handed blow Khalar Singh’s
tulwars deflect the blow The sword impacts the hard
stone floor-

AND THE SWORD BREAKS

Conan falls to the ground His stomach wound is now
gaping blood pouring onto the stone His eyes lose focus
from the loss of blood

KHALAR SINGH (CONT’D)
And so it ends A warrior once
invincible now beaten A sword once so
strong now broken
(raises his tulwars)
And nothing left but suffering

Conan’s eyes focus His brow furrows Through will alone
his lifts his head to face Khalar Singh

CONAN
It is only by suffering a sword gets its
strength

Khalar Singh strikes Conan lunges with his broken sword
the jagged edge of it piercing right through Khalar
Singhs throat

Khalar Singh sways a moment eyes full of disbelief then
falls to the stone floor

CONAN (CONT’D)
For my father for my people

Conan slices across Khalar’s throat killing him
instantly

CONAN

Rushes to Tamara’s side The powerful wind still swirls
all around them Conan breaks the chains containing
Tamara

AND THE WIND STOPS THE SMOKE DISSIPATES

Conan smiles and stares in--

TAMARA’S EYES They remain JET BLACK Conan turns to see
the city below

ACHERON

A wave of pure flame whisks through the city setting the
fog literally ablaze The souls of Acheron CRY OUT as
they immolate like their bodies did long ago

The entire city ignites the stone itself burning as if
it were tinder Hell on earth

TAMARA

Her small body is the touchstone for all the destruction
pulsating with power Slowly Tamara’s form elevates
rising above the altar

With her jet black eyes she looks down at Conan as if he
were little more than a stranger

Her face buckles as she unleashes another wave of
destruction Giant cracks snake through the stone walls
of the city many of the statues come crumbling down
Along with firepure Armageddon

But with that--we get a glimpse of Tamara in her eyes
struggling to get through

TAMARA
Conan--please--stop me--

Conan picks up a spear but he’s slow to bring it to
bear

TAMARA (CONTD)
No more--blood on my--hands--please--

CONAN
The warrior reaches back and thrusts the spear BOOM

CUT TO

EXT ACHERON DAY
Conan carries Tamara’s limp body as he reaches the cliff

above Acheron Down below the city crumbles both
burning and falling apart with the great quakes

TAMARA

Her eyes flutter her soul close to peace Blood stains
her teeth as she struggles for her last breath

TAMARA
What-—-what will you do now Cimmerian

CONAN
Live

TAMARA
Good Live for us all

Conan gives Tamara one last kiss her blood staining his
lips red as his mother’s did as a child

Conan holds her to his chest as he strides down off the
mountain pass

FADE TO BLACK
