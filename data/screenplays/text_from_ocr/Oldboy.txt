REVEAL

INT THE LADYBUG SHOPPE - NIGHT

A trendy store catering to young girls An attractive
clerk CHLOE closes up flipping the ‘Open’ sign to
‘Closed’

OUTSIDE the sound of a MAN half-humming half-singing
can be heard getting closer A barely recognizable
version of “Climb Every Mountain” from “The Sound of
Music”

MAN (0S)
ford every stream follow every
rainbow till you find your dream

Chloe wipes down the display cases with windex The
singing abruptly stops

KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK Startled Chloe looks over to see
someone banging on the glass A MAN in his twenties
wearing a wrinkled suit This is GUS

CHLOE
Sorry we’re closed

GUS
Wait it’s my daughter’s birthday I
need a gift

Chloe ignores him keeps cleaning Gus digs in his
wallet takes out a photo of a cute BABY pressing it up
against the glass

GUS (CONTD)
Cmon look at that face Who smiles like
that anymore

Chloe looks warming slightly

GUS (CONTD)
I just worked an eighty hour week for
that smile Now I don’t even have a
birthday present
He’s starting to win her over

GUS
Five minutes I promise

She unlocks lets him in BELLS ring on the door

CHLOE
Five minutes

As he enters the store Chloe gets a whiff of alcohol
Gus wanders the aisles swimming in choices He looks
confused and a little tipsy no idea where to even
begin

GUS
What do girls want at this age
CHLOE
How old is she
GUS
One
CHLOE

I see Well for that age

She steps towards him searching the merchandise He lets
her take over relying on her expertise

CHLOE
It’s not so much what she wants but what
shell have to remember

Gus follows closely as she continues the search-

GUS
I tried to come earlier but work was a
killer Closed the biggest account of my
life today Ever heard of the Buick Le

Sabre
CHLOE

GUS

(singing)

“Le Beauty Le Power Le Sabre”

CHLOE

Everyone’s gonna want one

CHLOE

GUS
Slogan song the whole campaign All

bought it in the room In the ROOM

His enthusiasm is infectious Chloe vibes off his
energy

GUS
Greatest day of my life

CHLOE
Wow You should be celebrating

GUS

Iam Everyone’s next door at
Franklin’s

(mood darkens )
But you know my wife She hates the
hours Hates what I do Makes it kinda
hard sometimes keeping the two worlds
separated

His infectious smile has faded and Chloe catches herself
gazing into Gus’s melancholy eyes She blushes once
again before looking off CLEARS her throat-

CHLOE
I think I know just what you want

Chloe walks around to a display case and produces a pair
of delicate ANGEL WINGS Chloe takes off her sweater
reveals her curvaceous body and models the wings for
Gus His face lights up and for a moment it’s as if
these two people were no longer strangers

CHLOE
I knew you’d like them

GUS
How much
(as she looks for the tag)
Never mind I’1l take them

Chloe takes off the wings
GUS
Thank you very much Most people
wouldn’t have opened that door

CHLOE
Sure they would’ve

GUS
Not these days with the ‘Me Generation’
and all You know you can tell more
about a person from how they interact
with total strangers than with their
closest friends Means you have a good
heart That’s rare hold onto it

Chloe blushes barely concealing a flattered smile

He holds her in his gaze and for some reason she can’t
look away unable to move Gus takes a step closer a
confident look on his face She yields to him Is this

a kiss

KNOCK-KNOCK Chloe and Gus look over to see a man and

woman

This is MIKE and GRETCHEN They’re both

stumbling drunk

MIKE
There you are Come on Gretchen found a
girl for you

GRETCHEN
She doesn’t speak a word of English You
can talk about the Buick deal all night

Mike and Gretchen both CRACK UP like it’s The Chappelle

Show

MIKE
(rattling the door)
What are you buying Let me in

GUS

MIKE

Mike and Gretchen disappear CRACKING UP again as they

go

GUS
Sorry they get a little crazy when
they’re drunk
Chloe has cooled noticeably now RINGING up the wings
Gus puts it on his credit card She hands him the bag

CHLOE
I hope your daughter enjoys it

Gus takes the bag looks at Chloe with a serious
expression

GUS

She shakes her head ‘no’ a gracious smile on her lips

CHLOE
Good night

GUS
Night

Gus exits the store Through the window we see him get
tackled by drunken Mike as Gretchen CACKLES like a hyena

Off Chloe shutting down the shop pondering her
decision

CUT TO

EXT CITY STREET —- NIGHT

It has started to RAIN Gus is in a phone booth across

the street from Chloe’s toy store and a bar FRANKLINS
As he talks he watches Mike and Gretchen fooling around
in front of Franklin’s slipping on the wet ground

GUS
(into phone)
You knew what my day was like so what do
you want from me Then don’t wait up

Gus rubs his head trying to mask his guilt

GUS
I know it’s late Justjust put her
on

Across the street Gretchen fights Mike off playfully
Gus adopts a sweet voice when talking to his daughter

GUS
(into phone)
Hi sweetie It’s Daddy Da-Dee
(MORE)
GUS (CONTD)

Happy birthday my angel I bought you
something and I can’t wait to give it to
you Can you wait up for me Hello
Angel

A public BUS stops at a red light blocks Gus’s view of
Mike and Grethcen Gus covers his ear to listen on the
receiver

REVERSE

The light turns GREEN and the Bus pulls away revealing
the phone booth now to be EMPTY Gus is gone without a
trace

CLOSE ON BOOTH the phone hangs limply by its cord

We follow a pristine white ANGEL FEATHER as it flutters
in the air gently falling onto the dirty ground

OFFSCREEN we hear Mike’s bewildered voice-

MIKE (0S)
GUS Where’d you go you fucker

CUT TO

TITLES

OLDBOY

INT HALLWAY

A dark dirty hallway lit by flickering fluorescent
lights We follow a pair of feet - gray dress pants and
black dress shoes - plodding down worn carpeting

In the distance we hear a muffled sound As the feet
nears a door the sound of a man speaking incoherently
becomes clearer

At the bottom of the door is latched opening One of the
feet reaches over and unlatches the opening and Gus’s
head suddenly pops out as if trying to squeeze out

Gus tries to fit one of his hands out desperately
grabbing at the feet who shake him off effortlessly
Gus speaks rambling - shifting from desperation
frustration and anger
GUS
Come talk to me Tell me why I’m here
okay I should know the reason why You
want money Tell me how much

The feet shift A tray of food TAQUITOS is placed on
the floor and the foot slides it towards the opening
Gus pulls it inside but only to clear his view He
sticks his head back out The feet begin to leave and
Gus grabs at them manages to hang on to one foot

GUS (CONTD)
What is this place Just tell me how
long I have to stay in here Just tell me
that huh

The foot shakes him off

GUS (CONTD)
Come here you sonuvabitch I11 fucking
kill you motherfucker

Gus desperate now tries to violently grab at the legs
anger mounting

GUS (CONTD)
I saw your face you chicken shit

The feet easily repel his grappling hands seemingly
toying with him and pushing him back into the opening
Fearing being closed in Gus changes his tune

GUS (CONTD)
I’m sorry I didn’t mean it Just tell
me two weeks Or

The feet manage to push Gus back behind the door and
latches the door shut

GUS (0S) (CONTD)
-a month C’mon you cocksucking piece
of shit

Gus begins to bang from behind the door

GUS (0S) (CONT’D)
Just tell me how long goddammit
INT ROOM —- CONTINUOUS

A small sparse room A bed an open bathroom ugly 70’s
style Southwestern wallpaper dirty brown carpet a big
screen television

A security camera is mounted on the wall encased ina
clear PLASTIC DOME

Gus emaciated unshaved with scraggly hair kneels in
front of the door banging at the door with his food tray
strewn behind him He screams like a madman

GUS
You fucking cunt You think this is
funny I’11 break your skull open and
piss on it

He whirls around and grabs the food tray and bangs it on
the door with all his might

GUS (CONTD)
I’m gonna cut of your balls and shove it
in your eye socket you fuckin’ faggot
You hear me

He keeps beating at the door frantically He gropes the
floor takes the plate and throws it at the door then
returns to banging with his hands
GUS (VO) (CONTD)
If they told me it would be twenty
yearswould it have been any easier to
endure

CUT TO

THE ROOM - MONTHS LATER

Instead of a window there’s a small PROJECTION SCREEN on
the wall displaying a slide show In rapid succession we
see

-Gus on his wedding day

-A relaxing beachscape (like a Corona ad)

-The Advantage Inc Logo
-A Buick ad with a young woman sexy woman next to the
car Below the tag line “This is not your Dad’s
Buick”

GUS (VO)
In advertising they say a picture’s worth
a thousand sales But people only see
what they want to see

-Gus at his college graduation
-Charles Bronson from ‘Death Wish’

GUS (VO)
My slide show reminded me of print ads
the captions missing for me to fill in

-Gus on a highschool tennis team
-A pristine mountain lake

-Group photo with Gus Mike and other colleagues under a
banner reading “Ad Vantage Inc”

-A cobra ready to strike

GUS (VO)
I look around me and it makes me wonder
if this prison is endorsed

Gus ignores the slides kneels on his bed opposite a
mirror unmoving staring at it

CLOSE on mirror Gus smiles maniacally exposing large
white teeth It’s a contorted expression something like
demented glee His hair long and wild falls past his
shoulders His unkempt beard flows from his chin

Suddenly MUSIC is heard An instrumental version of
“Climb Every Mountain” It’s accompanied by a hissing
sound as gas emanates from exposed pipes on the corners

He looks at the projection screen on the wall a photo of
Gus at eighteen standing next to a new car It’s
followed by a slide of a brutal car accident (think “Red
Asphalt”)

GUS (VO)
When they play ‘Climb Every Mountain’
the gas comes When the gas comes I fall
asleep

The lights in the room dim and Gus falls off the bed and
onto the carpet With his face on the carpet he notices
a trail of ants crawling away and into a small crack on
the wall

As Gus lays on the floor sleeping the lights go on and
two MEN enter putting on latex gloves One of the men
takes out leather case and opens it to reveal a hair-
cutting kit He takes out scissors

GUS (VO) (CONTD)
When I wake my hair’s always cut
Shorter than what I’d like They change
my clothes and clean up the place

The other man begins to tidy the room The man takes an
EMPTY GLASS and places it in a plastic zip-loc bag

GUS (VO) (CONTD)
I guess I should be grateful to the
fucking bastards

One of the men injects a syringe into Gus and draws
BLOOD

ROOM - MONTHS LATER

The SLIDE SHOW displays a photo of Gus as a little boy
riding a big wheel It’s closely followed by a National
Geographic shot of a lion taking out a gazelle

Gus wakes up on the small bed blinking up at the slide
show images Gus watches them emotionless His hair is
neatly trimmed face shaved The TV blares in the BG

Suddenly something on the television grabs his
attention He watches a police report

TELEVISION
A shot of a typical suburban home
REPORTER (VO)
Kayla Harris’s body was found stabbed in
the neck late Monday morning
GUS goes over to the TV focusing on the story Behind
him the slide film BREAKS throwing only WHITE LIGHT

against the small screen

TELEVISION

Police comb through the home A body lies underneath a
sheet

REPORTER (VO)
In their suburban home Neighbors are
outraged and the police are requesting
that anyone with further information to
please call the hot-line Her husband
who disappeared a year ago is wanted for
questioning

Gus looks away from the television feeling something on
his forearm

He turns to look at his arm and notices something twitch
under his skin A small bump begins to move Suddenly
it burrows out of his skin It’s an ANT Gus focuses on
the ant as it crawls along his skin

REPORTER (CONT’D)
Blood found at the crime scene and a
glass with fingerprints matched that of
Gus Harris

TELEVISION

They flash a picture of Gus and his wife a honeymoon
picture on the screen trim handsome a far cry from
what he looks like now

Gus looks at the picture and cries hysterically as ants
crawl all over his face

The lights in the room dim and we are swallowed in
darkness

We hear the sound of GLASS BREAKING

INT ROOM - LATER
The lights are on

A mirror in the room shattered Shards lay on the
carpet We see the reflection of someone moving inside
the room which is turned upside down

Gus is dragged by his feet along the carpet We see the
slashes on his wrists A large pool of blood stains the
dirty carpet

INT ROOM - YEARS LATER

The mirror on the wall reflects a deteriorating image of
Gus He’s getting fat and run-down reciting lines of
dialogue as he’s turne away from the big screen TV

GUS
How much for the knife Ah that is
around 8 million dollars Eight million
dollars for a knife That’s
preposterous Any other knife yes but
not this knife It belonged to a king
A king

Gus notices something WHITE scurry across the floor in
his peripheral vision He forces a bite of a taquito
systematically chewing and swallowing it We notice that
the slashes on his wrists have healed He intentionally
drops a crumb on the floor

The little white something scurries again but this time
Gus reaches down and scoops it up

A little WHITE MOUSE It squirms desperately but Gus
isn’t letting it go admiring it for a long beat It’s
been a long time since he’s felt life He relishes it
absorbing it’s warmth listening to it’s heartbeat
making him more alive and more human in turn Suddenly
he stuffs it in his mouth The mouse pushes at his
cheeks making them stretch in unnatural directions

He calmly turns to watch the TELEVISION the mouse still
in his closed mouth We see

Changing technology The clapper Reality television
Violent crime Chia pets Church programming Home
shopping network Gulf war Jesse Ventura running for
Governor Images mapping out the years that pass by

GUS (VO)
The television is my only link to the
outside world A world that’s clean
wholesome Untouched It only lets you
see what it wants you toleaving you to
always want more It makes you wait
again and again but never
satisfiesjust reminds you that life is
only real if you believe it

Gus watches a show edited for television The curse
words are edited out He flips to ‘Three’s Company’
then ‘Beverly Hills 90291’ then ‘Seinfeld’

GUS (VO)
Everything makes sense Everyone’s
beautiful Perfect I can sit around
the coffee shop all day with all my
beautiful friends and my problems will go
away in about half an hour or so

Gus smiles to himself - a plastered hazy smile

GUS (VO)
My teacher church friend and lover

On the television we see a news show An Asian-American
anchorwoman shares the screen with her co-anchor an old
man with white hair Gus kneels in front of the screen
takes the mouse out of his mouth and puts it on his
shoulder

LEE ANN KIM
-and I’m Lee Ann Kim with tonights
headlines

Gus touches the screen with his hand starts to
masturbate His strokes intensify but the image changes
from that of Lee Ann to the older co-anchor He stops
waits patiently When Lee Ann is back on screen he
immediately starts masturbating again The mouse gets up
on its hind legs

LEE ANN KIM
-barricaded for four hours while police
cleared the area

Gus is about to reach climax but the shot changes to a
wide shot to include the older co-anchor Gus moves his
hand to block his sight of the old man He finishes just
in time-

LEE ANN KIM
Back to you Phil

-and slowly lets his hand fall from the screen

FADE TO BLACK

INT ROOM

Gus flips channels It’s not cable so Gus only has a
few stations to choose from As he flips his pet mouse
RALPH runs up his arm Gus opens his mouth and the
mouse runs inside and takes a seat on his tongue He
stops at a new channel one he’s never seen before

A black and white image from a security camera It’s
Gus from the back view sitting watching the television
He closes it and looks over at the security camera behind
him - inside the plastic bubble We see his face on TV
as well He looks back to television and sees his back
It’s disorienting for a second He wants to see his face
on television but can’t He repeats this action a few
more times then settles in watching himself watch the
television

He opens his mouth as Ralph runs out of his mouth onto
the floor

GUS (VO)
Are we being televised

He raises the remote and presses a button FLIP The
screen changes to a baseball game

LATER
Sound of crashing glass
Glass shards lay on the carpet

Again we see Gus passed out on the floor next to a pool
of blood by to the dried blood from his previous
attempt His wrists slashed once again His body lays on
top of plastic as he is being dragged along the carpet

LATER

CLOSE ON a journal on the table There’s a stack of
them there The mouse runs down his arm onto the
journals Gus picks up a pen and taps it on the table
Then puts it down

He stares up at the changing slide show A photo of him
at Halloween in a Freddy Kruger outfit followed by a
news still of starving kids in Africa followed by Gus on
his honeymoon with Kayla followed by a movie still of
Jack Nicholson wielding an axe from ‘The Shining’
followed by Gus in a sharp suit holding a glass of wine
on a balcony And so on

LATER

With his wounds healing Gus sits at the table staring at
the empty pages of the journal

He glances over passed the dried blood on the carpet to
the television and sees the news report about Princess
Diana dying as she was chased by the paparazzi Gus
looks away and back to the journal He picks up Ralph
and puts it in his mouth Ralph runs in and out of his
open mouth as he picks up the pen and begins to write
down names

GUS (VO)
I wrote down all the people whom I fought
with bothered and hurt

Pages and pages of names

GUS (VO) (CONTD)
This was both my prison journal and an
autobiography of my evil deeds

Time passes He finishes one journal writing cover to
cover and starts on another

GUS (V0) (CONTD)
I fooled myself thinking I was getting
somewhere My complacency solidified

INT ROOM

Gus stares at a plate of taquitos

GUS (VO)
God I hate taquitos

Ralph runs up to his plate and starts nibbling on the
taquitos Gus strokes him gently

INT ROOM

Gus’s hair is getting long again He lies on his back
asleep SNORING loudly with his mouth wide open

GUS (VO)
I had slipped into a dream world while
the world around me lived on

Suddenly he stops breathing He starts to choke and
COUGH He grabs at his throat something lodged in
there Then with one violent heave he COUGHS something
out The object THUMPS onto the floor

Gus looks down to see the Ralph stiff from rigormortis
He gently scoops him up tries to revive him

GUS (VO)
I had died And in my death something
was born Something hungry and vital

But as he realizes that Ralph is dead Gus starts to
break down His eyes moisten lips tremble Then SOBS
WAILS It might as well be his mother lying dead before
him

INT HALLWAY
A deep thumping sound echoes down the hallway

GUS (VO)
Something I could no longer control

Sounds like someone’s hammering in one of the rooms

INT ROOM
It’s not hammering

Gus with his shirt off has an intense look on his face
He has drawn a SILHOUETTE of a man on the wall The
plastic bubble serves as the head He punches the bubble
HARD Hard enough to leave bloody marks from his bruised
knuckles He jumps around restless enjoying the
physical activity

GUS (VO)
Who would have done this to me Was it
Mike Harrison Bloom Jon Donson
Terry Eckhouse

Gus reads a litany of names punches harder with every
one

GUS (VO) (CONTD)
Whoever you are I’ve only just started
I’m new and I’m hungry I thirst for
your blood I crave your destruction
Ill rape your women eat your babies
make them bleed thru their eyes The
last thing you’ll see alive is me
laughing

The focus on Gus’s face is intensifies as he hits harder

GUS (VO) (CONTD)
If you think this is your revenge wait
for me I’11 show you what revenge
really means

Gus gives one final punch to the wall CRACK He
screams in pain and folds to the ground holding his
bruised hand

CUT TO

TRANSFORMATION MONTAGE

-Gus does sit-ups gets winded collapses He grabs at
his gut SIGHS

-Close on SILHOUETTE Gus PUNCHES the wall blood
trickling from his knuckles He ignores the pain
stonefaced focusing on the hand-drawn face he’s
scribbled onto the bubble

-Gus does push-ups shirtless His knuckles are scabbed
and cracked He tires quickly but forces himself to do
more

-Gus wolfs down a plate of taquitos tosses the plate at
the door Drops and does push-ups

-Gus dances in front of the silhouette talking shit like
Ali taunts the silhouette Then BAM-BAM-BAM the
punches fly once more

-Climb Every Mountain” plays as Gus punches the
silhouette There are noticeable indentations in the
wall now His hits intensify until he finally CRACKS
plexiglas bubble Gus keeps punching as the gas seeps in
the room a twisted smile on his face He SCREAMS along-

GUS
Climb every mountain search high and
low follow every byway every path you
know Climb every mountain ford every
stream
-until he finally succumbs to the gas falls unconscious
END TRANSFORMATION MONTAGE

CUT TO

INT ROOM

Gus does hundreds of sit-ups Years have passed Gus’s
body has changed Body and mind have hardened He’s
ripped now His knuckles are knobby and calloused

He pops up quickly from his sit-ups and unleashes a
volley of punches at the wall His movements are
economized lethal He has the air and physique of a
trained fighter

He drops quickly and does push-ups then pops back up and
- BAM-BAM-BAM - more lightning fast punches

LATER

He straightens a piece of wire from the journal and
scratches a mark on his skin He stares at the wire as
a thought runs thru his mind

LATER

CLOSE ON GUS’S EYE pressed up against the tinted
plexiglass dome He stares inside at the security

camera trying to find its blind spot

He looks off to the wall with the projection screen and
smiles The image is Mel Gibson from “Mad Max”

Gus LAUGHS at Mel - a crazy detached laugh - before the
slide CHANGES again

-A shot of scrawny teenage Gus wearing a Karate uniform

CUT TO
Gus reaches into his bed and secretly pulls out the wire

CUT TO
Unseen by the camera Gus uses the wire to scrape at the
wall under the projection screen He’s cleared the
wallpaper and drywall and starts to scrape mortar between
exposed bricks

CUT TO

A solid brick wall

Scraping sounds

Suddenly a brick is loosened and light illuminates
through crack The brick is pushed out and we see Gus’s
eyes peering out He smiles at his handiwork

CUT TO

Gus watches a boxing match on television concentrates on
the footwork and punching His eyes dart around
calculating every movement

He gets up mimics the moves of the winning boxer

CUT TO
More bricks are disappear from the wall

CUT TO

We catch glimpses of images and story that spans the time
of Gus’s captivity From new innovations and technology
deaths the Berlin Wall the Israeli Palestinian
conflict the Gulf War court room trials cultural
phenomena idols television milestones game shows
reality television 911 the presidential election the
Russian school attack invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq
North Korea the Indian Ocean tsunami Life and death

CUT TO
Gus pushes his body out of the brick wall only to
encounter another wall of bricks He feels the bricks
but doesn’t get discouraged and starts on the second
wall

CUT TO

EXT SIDE OF BUILDING

It’s raining We see street signs and a glimpse of the
city scape beyond the brick facade of a building

Suddenly a brick pops out and falls to the ground below
Fingers stretch out through the hole feeling the rain
INT ROOM

Gus has broken through the second wall He takes his

hand and licks the traces of water Nothing has tasted
this good

GUS (VO)
I’1l be out in a month Just one more
month Ill be out One month Just one
more month Just one more month

“Climb Every Mountain” comes on and once again gas begins
to fill the room

Gus rushes to cover his wall replacing the bed in its
place Gus flops on top of the bed with a big smile on
his face as he stares at the traces of rain on his hand
The slide show continues in the BG

GUS (VO)
I’1l need money when I get out Should
I rob or steal No I’m just going to
find that motherfucker

Gus looks to the slide show Sly Stallone from “Rocky”
Then a Jamaican waterfall Then a scorpion killing a
frog

GUS (VO)
I should eat something first But what
Anything but fucking taquitos No I’1l
eat when he’s dead I’11 eat over his
rotting body Where am I anyway Sounds
like the city Doesn’t matter where I
am I’11 find him 1’11 know when it’s
him and I’1l rip out his tongue I’11
break his neck and watch him beg for
death

More slides Gus reciving his First Communion in church
Then a horrific snarling werewolf Then a happy face

GUS (VO)
What if I get out and it’s the 52nd
floor Even if I fall and die I’m still
going to find him
He turns his hand and sees the callouses on his knuckles
GUS (VO)
In just one month I’m getting out I’m
getting out
His eyes flutter and he drifts off to sleep

CUT TO

DARKNESS

We hear shuffling and labored breathing which increases
Hands feeling around the space

A lighter is ignited The weak flame illuminates a tight
space that resembles a coffin Gus lies crammed inside
He burns his hand and the light goes out He fires up
the lighter again He whimpers as claustrophobia sets
in Is he being buried alive He struggles banging his
hands on the structure facing him The light goes out
and his hits become stronger and stronger

Wood splinters LIGHT begins to shine through freshly
made cracks Gus breaks out of his confinement
shielding his eyes from the blinding sun

Images BLUR and distort The dawning SUN seems all too
bright like it’s burning his skin

Gus starts to freak out Thoughts rush in and out of his
mind - is he dreaming Eyes closed he thrusts his hands
out groping blindly for the safety of the walls - but
they’ve disappeared

WE PULL OUT to reveal that Gus is not out in a field at
all but actually in a garden situated on top of a roof in
the middle of the city

White birds fly above Gus who sits up He squints pass
the landscape and sees the figure of

A MAN standing on the ledge of the building The figure
backlit with birds flying around him resembles an angel
The figure holds his hands out feeling the slight breeze
around him

Gus feels his body when a LOUD BOOMING SOUND fills the
air He grabs his ears protecting them from the
deafening din

WE PULL OUT FURTHER to reveal that Gus is on top of a
church with its bells ringing Gus screams at the top
of his lungs - sensory overload

GUS
Aaaagh

When the sound ceases Gus moves towards the man
squinting against the light

The man looks at Gus nonchalant savors a cigarette
Gus approaches him carefully reaching out with his hands
like a blind man

Gus reaches the ledge begins to feel the man his dark
suit his skin He reaches over and smells his scent
like a dog Gus takes his free hand and runs it over his
face Slowly his vision returns to him

The man inhales his cigarette deeply

MAN
Would this taste this good if I didn’t
know it was going to be my last

The man takes one deep drag and throws the cigarette over
the building Gus watches it fall to the street below

The man closes his eyes and falls stretches his arms and
freefalls by lying backwards -

He falls a bit then stops

The man opens his eyes and realizes that he’s virtually
suspended in air Gus has the man’s tie in his hands and
keeps him from falling

Gus looks at the resigned man but keeps his grip on the
tie They stand there for a few seconds just looking at
each other precariously near the ledge

GUS (VO)
Maybe this was a test A second chance
to undo what I’ve done Or maybe it’s
fate laughing at me

Gus reaches for the man’s coat takes out a cigarette and
calmly lights it

CUT TO

MOMENTS LATER

Gus and the man sit down by the ledge staring at each
other Gus smokes another cigarette as the man lights
it

MAN
Do you know why you were kept in there
for twenty years

GUS
He’1l tell me when I find him

Gus stares straight ahead emotionless No answer

MAN
But you’re free now

Gus is starting to tire of this
Gus stands up abruptly He’s wasting his time here

MAN
Where you going

Gus walk towards the rooftop door disappears

INT CHURCH STAIRWAY

Gus emerges from a darkened stairwell Ahead of him is a
long corridor peppered with sporadic colored light from
a pair of STAINED GLASS windows At the end of the hall
another MAN walks through some doors The MAN looks back
towards Gus and motions for him to follow him

INT SOUP KITCHEN

Gus passes through double doors into a room filled with
people lining up to be served food The man he’s been
following a VOLUNTEER pushes something at Gus Gus
CLASPS his wrist forcefully looks down to see an empty
tray The volunteer quakes with fear-

VOLUNTEER
It’s OK Take it There’s plenty for
everyone

CUT TO

TABLES

Around the room we focus on faces of HOMELESS PEOPLE
looking up from their meals staring at

Gus shovelling food into his mouth Relishing it like
it’s the best thing he’s ever eaten He could care less
about the eyes focused on him He eats like a madman
eating everything in sight except for TAQUITOS He
carefully avoids these reaching over at other trays and
picks off food

Soon people are moving away protecting their turkey pot
pies frightened by his brutish behavior

He continues to eat sitting alone

EXT CITY STREET —- DAY

Burly volunteers BURST thru the doors make a wide arc on
the street in front of the soup kitchen as Gus exits
food clenched in his fists Several more volunteers exit
behind Gus giving him a wide berth moving cautiously as
though cornering a wild animal

Gus makes a show of intimidating them runs at a
volunteer who cowers in self-defense The volunteers
rush back inside and slam the door shut behind them Gus
LAUGHS taking a huge bite from the food in his fist
stalks down the street

CUT TO
LATER

Gus walks the sidewalks taking in the city People
noises smells He’s on the fringes of a business
district filled with empty rundown buildings and
boarded up shops

EXT BUSINESS PLAZA

He crosses into a busy area Multiple corporations
sharing a common space Gus sees the name ‘AD VANTAGE
INC’ on one of the corporate towers keeps walking

GUS (VO)
I remember this place I used to come
here all the time

Gus stops by a tinted office window notices his
reflection He feels his face now aged

GUS (VO)
Now it’s nothing I recognize

EXT STREET

Gus walks along the streets gazing at the sights of newly
erected buildings He doesn’t see ahead as a bike
messenger steers towards him He dodges the messenger
and inadvertently hits a parked car

The car’s alarms go on making Gus jump back He stares
at the car as it BEEPS

CUT TO

ANOTHER STREET - LATER

Gus runs down the street hitting a row of parked cars and
tripping their alarms Pedestrians scatter out of his
way

He looks back smiling at the chaotic symphony he’s
created like some kind of mad conductor People stare
point

Gus turns the corner feels something hit his leg He
looks to see a white cane and a BLIND MAN groping the
air

BLIND MAN
Excuse me Can you help me cross the
street

Gus pauses for a bit as the Blind Man reaches out for
him He focuses on the Blind Man’s sunglasses Instead
of taking his hand he takes the sunglasses puts them on
and walks away

EXT STREET

Gus sees an entrance to the subway He runs across the
street barely missing oncoming traffic A car swerves
CRASHES into another Another car screeches inches from
hitting him Gus doesn’t even look back before running
down the stairs

INT SUBWAY CAR
It’s rush hour

In the back of a car Gus hangs on to the straps as more
people push their way inside The car moves jerkily
pushing the people from one side to the other

Bodies rub against each other Every touch a sensual
spark

Gus’s hand trembles as he looks on with a maniacal
expression Everywhere he looks - a woman’s hair nape
of the neck curve of a breast an exposed arm It’s
intoxicating It’s everywhere

He’s doing his best to resist but it’s sensory overload
and it looks like he might pass out

A woman catches a glimpse of him with this perverse smile
on his face She grimaces and moves away but not before
her hair brushes against his arm Gus reaches ecstacy

EXT BRIDGE

Gus stands at the bridge still as hours pass by -
traffic flowing behind him He watches the sun sink
Tears well in his eyes

EXT PARK

Gus lays on the grass staring at the stars His eyelids
are heavy and begin to close

GUS (VO)
What if this is a dream What if I wake
up back in the room and all this was just
a dream A hypothesis in my mind

He resistsbut ultimately gives in to sleep

EXT BUSINESS PLAZA -— MORNING

Gus washes himself off using a decorative fountain in
front of AD VANTAGE INC’s offices People in suits
stare at him

An old homeless looking man approaches him Gus looks at
the man unsure if he’s looking at him or not The old
man reaches into his pockets and pulls out a cell phone
in one hand and a taquito in the other Offers both to
Gus

OLD MAN
I don’t know anything

The old man walks away
Gus is about to go after him when the phone rings Gus
stares at the phone for a few beats unsure Finally he

puts it up to his ear

GUS
Who is this

MALE VOICE (VO)
Hows life in a bigger box

Gus looks around frantic

GUS
Show your face Where are you

People around him are startled
MALE VOICE (VO)
Whether it’s a pebble or a grain of sand
in water they both sink alike
(beat)
And eat something will ya You’re skin
and bones
Click The caller is gone

Gus keeps looking around he runs in the direction of the
old man but he’s disappeared

Half-smiling and half-crying he stares at the remains of
the taquito He’s crushed it in anger This is one sick
joke Suddenly a thought hits him

He smells the remains of the taquito in his hand licks
it

GUS (VO)

More cilantro Not enough cilantro
EXT PHONE BOOTH
Gus runs into a phone booth and grabs a phone book He
flips through it and rips out pages
EXT CITY STREETS
Gus double checks the information on the yellow pages and
looks across the street at small restaurant called
BURRITO KING
INT BURRITO KING

Gus stares at the menu He reaches into his pockets No

A CUSTOMER sits with his taquito He eats a couple of
chips then eyes the salsa bar He gets up and leaves his
plate behind

A HAND stealthily grabs the taquito

CUT TO

Gus bites into a taquito He swishes it in his mouth

GUS (VO)
Not crunchy enough

He spits it out and throws the taquito away

EXT SIDEWALK

Gus approaches a Taco stand He spies a small table
where the customers stand to leave When they’re gone
Gus goes to the table and sorts through the leftovers
Bingo A half-eaten taquito

He sniffs it then takes a bite He takes a second moves
the food inside his mouth

GUS (VO)
The seasoningtastes different

He spits it out onto the sidewalk and moves on

EXT ALLEY

We pan from another restaurant to the alleyway beside it
Gus is diving headfirst into a dumpster

He comes up for air with a mouthful of food

GUS (VO)
Too much onions

EXT STREET

Gus walks aimlessly towards another restaurant He
enters without giving a second look to the place

CUT TO

INT TACO JOE’S

Gus walks in and immediately notices the dirty brown
carpet An old taco sauce stain on the floor looks
vaguely like dried blood He smells the air His face
crinkles at a familiar scent Gus covers his nose with
his hand looks around What he sees makes his jaw drop

The same 70s-style wallpaper dirty brown floors even
the plastic bubble in the corner with a surveillance
camera A projection screen displays a slide show of
nature shots It’s all there Everywhere he looks Gus
is reminded of his prison cell The resemblance is
clearly not coincidental

GUS (VO)
The nostalgia is too much I can’t want
it but I do They’ve twisted me into
loving my cell

Gus grows weak slinking to the floor dry-heaving
Patrons look at him strangely while others simply
ignore stepping over him to get in line For Gus it’s
like a twisting inescapable nightmare He crawls for
the exit but each movement is weak and labored Someone
holds the door open for him a YOUNG WOMAN in a Taco
Joes T-shirt

Gus slinks past her and out onto the sidewalk where he
collapses The MANAGER hollers at the Young Woman

MANAGER
Anna Come on we’re busy

She takes one last look at Gus splayed out on the
sidewalk before heading inside The door shuts closed
behind her

EXT TACO JOES
With the sights and sounds blocked out Gus can finally

breathe again He sits up on the concrete facing away
from the restaurant refusing to look

GUS (VO)
I want to burn it to the ground Watch
the people run from it screaming their
flesh on fire But I won’t Not yet

He scrutinizes the street he’s on the neighborhood
every person passing him on the street His mind races
to find another clue another piece of the puzzle

The door opens behind him once more and black Army boots
CLOMP past him arriving at a moped parked on the
sidewalk next to Gus It’s the young woman from a minute
ago Anna She loads several delivery orders into the
basket on the back of the scooter and mounts the little
bike A magnetized placard on the moped announces its
purpose

“Taco Joes Delivery”

Anna REVS the motor and the bike takes off down the
street

In a flash Gus is up on his feet sprinting down the
street after her

CUT TO

EXT CITY STREETS

A steep incline The moped PUTT-PUTTs its way up the
street fighting the pull of gravity

After a long beat Gus runs up the same street
struggling to keep up

ANGLE ON HILLCREST

Gus reaches the top of the hill panting and out of
breath Ahead of him at the bottom of the hill the
moped picks up speed BOTTOMS OUT and keeps on going
down the street

GUS takes a deep breath trudges onward

CUT TO

INT LAWYERS OFFICE

Anna stands at the door while an office CLERK takes the
receipt for a food order looks for a pen

ANNA
Here

She removes a pen from her back pocket and turns around
offers her bare shoulder for him to write on a
mischievous look on her face The Clerk gets an eyeful

ANNA (CONT’‘D)
I’ve got to get a clear copy so don’t
forget to press hard

As he signs the receipt the Clerk’s hand shakes When
he’s done she hands him the bag looks at the tip
amount smiles

Anna looks around pulls out to reveal a small bag of dope
between her fingers

ANNA (CONT’D)
Dessert

The Clerk looks around and fishes for some bills He
hands it to her and quickly pockets the drugs

The Clerk looks past Anna to see
GUS just arriving He looks like he’s about to pass out
from the exertion Yet he scrutinizes the Clerk like a

criminal peeking into the office behind him

Anna just shrugs at the Clerk and leaves

EXT PARKING LOT

Anna gets back on her moped casts a sidelong glance at
Gus who watches her like a hawk

ANNA
What do you want man You’ve been
following me all night

GUS
(out of breath)
An address Somewhere you deliver

ANNA
I don’t have time for this

GUS
Wait

He’s still catching his breath

GUS
They order everyday You’ve delivered
there Just hear me out

ANNA
What’s it worth to you

GUS
I don’t have any money It’s just the
address

She dons her helmet starts up the bike

ANNA
Fuck off

She takes off down the street

INT GAS STATION

GREASE MONKEYS ogle Anna as she approaches with their
food

GREASE MONKEY
Heya sweetness

They line up as she hands out bags Some search through
their food until they find what they real want - dime
bags

The mechanic takes a single dollar bill and tucks it into
her blouse She pretends to be flattered

ANNA
Ooh a whole dollar Are you sure

GREASE MONKEY
Haven’t had a chance to cash my check

ANNA
Guess you’ll just owe me bitch-ass

As she turns around to head back to the moped she sees
Gus watching from the corner

CUT TO

EXT TACO JOES

The sun is setting in the sky as Gus walks towards the
restaurant He looks like hell one of his pant legs is
torn from a nasty fall and he’s bleeding on his shins

He walks up to the moped and feels the engine still
warm

ANNA (0S)
That’s him

Gus looks up to see Anna standing beside the alley with
three burly Grease Monkeys One of them holds a crowbar

ANNA
Meet my friends weirdo

CUT TO

INT ALLEY BEHIND TACO JOE’S
Gus and the Grease Monkeys circle each other

GUS (VO)
All those days boxing a fake opponent
Can years of theory actually work in the
real world For a moment I question if
any of this is real

Finally one steps up and swings the crowbar but Gus
ducks it and belts the guy twice in the ribs Another
one tries to KICK but Gus catches his foot and yanks him
off balance He tumbles to the ground as Gus scrambles
to his feet Gus circles them hands awkwardly at his
sides

The third Grease Monkey attacks Gus punches him in the
mouth Gus starts to bleed and a smile spreads across
his lips - he’s never felt so alive

GUS (VO)
Nothing is more real than blood

Now wide awake Gus puts his dukes up dodges a punch
then another Dances The men LAUGH at him Gus
advances on them goes to work

Anna watches from around the corner as BAM-BAM-BAM
Three men fall to the ground

The Monkeys get up and two of them rush Gus The one
that stays behind unsheathes a KNIFE Sunlight glints
off the blade as he jams it into Gus’ stomach Gus still
tries to fight but he’s losing too much blood

The three attackers SPLIT the scene without a single word
to Anna who stands there horrified It’s a cowardly
victory

She wants to leave but Gus’s quiet GASPS of pain echo
thru the alleyway making her pause

As he collapses onto the dirty ground she walks to him
Gus passes out with Anna standing over him like a priest
at a funeral

CUT TO

INT APARTMENT - NIGHT

Gus’s eyes flutter open and look around Is he back in
the room For a moment it seems so until he focuses and
realizes it’s just a small studio apartment The walls
are decorated with an eclectic mix of found objects
displayed as art The windows are draped with a string
of lights

He realizes that he’s laying on a ratty mattress on the
floor

Gus tries to move but can’t His hand is tied to the
radiator He pulls with the bit of energy he has but
can’t pry himself loose

He shuts his eyes as dizziness overcomes him He looks
over to the kitchen In the dark he sees Anna standing
over the oven stirring something in a small pot She
looks over to him Her mouth moves but Gus can only
catch phrases

ANNA
it’s getting infected

Gus turns his attention to his abdomen and sees a bandage
poorly applied to his side The realization of the wound
makes the pain real for Gus He screams before passing
out

CUT TO

ANOTHER NIGHT

Gus now looking pale and sickly opens his eyes He
sees Anna sitting along a wall reading his journal She
looks up at him an angry look on her face

ANNA
Good you’re alive I thought I was
going to have to stash you in a roll of
old carpet or something

Gus opens his mouth but nothing comes out He blacks
out

CUT TO

LATER

He opens his eyes to see Anna typing on the computer
surfing the internet The glow of the computer screen
illuminates the apartment He looks at the screen as
she scrolls thru photos of MEN They look almost like
mugshots but they aren’t Each photo is accompanied by
an address and a map

LATER
Gus wakes up soaked in sweat It drains his energy just
to turn his head He looks over to see Anna doing a line

of coke in the bathroom

She looks up in the mirror and sees him kicks the door
shut

CUT TO

LATER

The days blur Gus opens his eyes again Anna is going
through his journals Her face is streaked with tears

CUT TO

DAYS LATER

From the look of him Gus’s fever has passed He feels
something that compels his eyes to open slightly She
sees Anna carefully crawling towards him

He closes his eyes pretending to be out

Anna comes close enough to poke at the bandage on his
side His face twinges in pain but his eyes remain
closed Thinking that he’s fast asleep Anna carefully
removes the old bandage and washes his wound with
antiseptic Hearing his heavy breathing she inspects
him curious Her eyes wander down his chest onto his
abdomen Her hand trembles as she touches the skin
around the wound which is beginning to heal nicely

Her touch electrifies Gus The hairs on his body stand
up electrically charged His instincts take over and he
grabs her with his free hand pins her onto the mattress
She fights him but can’t overpower his weight

That’s when he sees the fear in her eyes

His lust quickly turns to guilt and disgust and for a
moment he hesitates This is all the time she needs and
Anna breaks free scampering away She gets to her feet
and grabs a knife SCREAMS at him-

ANNA
Don’t ever touch me I’11 fucking kill
you

She kicks him over and over again mercilessly Gus
takes it so disgusted with himself he can’t even look at
her

She does a line of coke off the computer table and grabs
her keys As she heads out the door she stops under the
light of the hallway to glower once more at Gus-

ANNA
Shoulda let you bleed to death

The door SLAMS shut and her army boots CLOMP down the
hall

Gus sits up He looks over at the computer screen The
same website from before is on her screen

A picture of some grim-faced anonymous man stares back
accompanied by a map and an address

CUT TO

LATER

The clock on the wall reads 3AM Anna comes home
stumbling drunk and crying Gus immediately sits up
watches her as she goes to the closet and unceremoniously
strips to her bra and panties wiping away tears She
clumsily puts on sweats and a T-shirt

GUS
What’s wrong

She ignores him and heads over to the computer table
She does a line of coke before heading towards the
bathroom He pulls at his restraints

GUS
How long you going to keep me here

The bathroom door SLAMS shut Gus is alone again

CUT TO

NEXT MORNING

Gus wakes to Anna WHISTLING as she flips over some bacon
on the griddle She looks over to see Gus

ANNA
Looks like you’re pretty much healed

Gus sits up She grabs a knife

ANNA (CONTD)
Getting pretty strong too

Gus doesn’t answer She walks over and puts a plate of
bacon and eggs on the mattress in front of him He
stares at it

A moment later she returns with a duffel bag drops it on
the ground Inside are Gus’s journals and a change of
clothes She places black pants and a black dress shirt
on the bed

ANNA
That’s the good thing about men when
they leave they leave

She sits down to eat Gus wolfs down the bacon and eggs
ravenous sopping up the remnants with a piece of toast

ANNA
After this you’re free to go

He stops eating looks up at her

GUS
What about the address

ANNA
What address

GUS
I’m not leaving till I get it

She throws her fork at him Then the whole plate of
food

ANNA
The hell you are motherfucker You leave
and you stay the fuck away

As Gus wipes scrambled eggs of his head Anna uncaps a
can of pepper spray Gus watches as she goes over to the
radiator and unties him He rubs his wrists red from
the restraints

ANNA
Get out

She goes over to the phone taking it off the receiver
Gus sits there motionless

ANNA
Get OUT

Gus gets up and walks out the door She looks over at
his journals

EXT ANNA’S APARTMENT BUILDING

Gus exits the building to see one of his journals on the
ground He looks up in time to see another journal

ANNA is at her window chucking all of Gus’ things out
He just watches her calmly until she’s done slamming her
window shut Then he goes about gathering up all his
stuff

EXT RESIDENTIAL HOME

Anna stands at the door of a suburban house as a TEENAGE
GIRL counts quarters from a piggy bank

food and closes the door

Anna SIGHS heads back to her scooter Gus emerges from
behind a tree catching her off guard She tries to get
on her scooter but he takes the key from the ignition

ANNA

She looks at him defiantly

ANNA
Is it true Those things you wrote in

GUS
Yes

ANNA

He looks away takes a step back

ANNA
You’re so consumed by revenge you ignored

steps nearby and takes a seat just staring at the
building entrance Suddenly he begins to WEEP It’s
heartbreaking the culmination of all the loss all the
pain

door still in her work clothes

She looks around for Gus drops her grocery bag into the
small dining table and walks around She looks out the
window but sees nothing Lights a cigarette Out of the
corner of her eye she spies the journals neatly stacked

She then hears the sound of the shower running She goes
up to the bathroom door and touches it slightly smiling
to herself

INT BATHROOM

Gus stands underneath the shower as steam envelopes him
He carefully soaps himself avoiding his wound Layers
of dirt wash away from his body onto the tub and down
the drain He takes out his bandage and cleans his
wound cringing

LATER

Gus stands in front of the bathroom mirror and wipes the
steam off the surface We see Gus’s reflection He
touches his face the deep wrinkles now embedded He
moves to the scraggly beard covering his chin

Gus glances over the bathroom sink He opens a drawer
and carefully inspects it then another In the second
drawer he finds a box of miscellaneous toiletries for
men He picks up a disposable shaver and turns it over
in between his fingers

Gus walks out of the bathroom now cleaned and groomed
His hair still long is now combed through and his beard
has been shaved off He’s cleaned up rather nicely

Anna looks at him taken aback

CUT TO

LATER

Gus sits at the small kitchen table opposite Anna Take
out containers litter the table

They sit there waiting for the other to eat They catch
each others’ eyes but quickly look away

Gus takes his chopsticks and carefully moves his food
with it and takes a small bite consciously controlling
himself

Anna looks on amused Suddenly she takes a huge chunk
of broccoli and shoves it in her mouth Gus watches her
as she puts more in her mouth She begins to laugh
spitting broccoli out breaking the ice Gus looks at
her and smiles He begins to feel more at ease and
begins to dig in

CUT TO

Anna clears her plate as Gus finishes his food

ANNA
Not the best orange chicken in the world
but it’s cheap

Gus finishes chewing tries to come up with conversation

GUS
It was good

Anna takes the plates to the sink nearby and deposits
them

ANNA
Guess anything’s a step up for you

Gus flinches at the statement Anna catches herself

ANNA (CONT’‘D)
I mean in a good way Talk about rock
bottom right From this point forward
nothing can be worse than what you’ve
already been thru You know how many
people wish they could say that That
they moved on

He stares ahead blankly He isn’t moving on from
anything

LATER

Bedtime Gus takes a seat on top of the mattress He
watches Anna on her computer once again scrolling thru
faces of men and maps

GUS
What’s that
ANNA
Found it by accident and now I’m hooked
(beat)

It’s a list of registered sex offenders
You can look up any address in the Unites
States and it’1ll tell you how many of
them are in your area I memorized my
delivery area so I know what houses to
stay away from

Gus nods mildly interested

She clicks off the computer and walks over to him She
turns his wrist over and sees the scars from self
inflicted wounds running her fingers over them She
looks at him curious

ANNA
Does it still hurt

Gus takes her own hand and lifts her sleeve She
protests a bit but he holds her hand in place with some
force

REVEAL She too has scars on her wrists albeit much
older

He touches them the same way she touched his Anna pulls
her hand away places her head on his shoulder He lets

Gus rides on the back of Anna’s scooter as she pilots it
down grimy streets past factories and warehouses An
industrial wasteland that seems worlds away from the
urban sprawl

She finds the address and stops the bike As Gus gets
off the scooter we see that he holds a HAMMER He looks
at the building

It’s a nondescript storage facility called “STOR-4-U”

EXT STOR-4-U

above him glowering
INT STOR-4-U - OFFICE

the entire wall

Each monitor is a window into a different cell similar
to the one inhabited by Gus Various PRISONERS are seen
in utter seclusion

The Office Manager TOPH HARPER is a slick-dressed man
in his late forties He paces the room talking on a
headset

TOPH
(on phone)

Toph has been duct taped so that his mouth is propped
open Gus brings the hammer into his line of sight

GUS

Toph PROTESTS nonsensically tries to talk but his mouth
won’t move Gus puts the claw-end of the hammer into
Toph’s mouth finds a tooth Toph breathes frantically
SCREAMS His tongue touches the cold metal of the hammer
as a trickle of blood falls from his gums

Gus cranks the hammer as though removing a stubborn nail
ANGLE ON KEYBOARD

As Toph WAILS we see a bloody tooth drop to the
keyboard It joins several other bloody teeth

ANGLE ON TOPH

The rag is back in his mouth though now it’s a bright
crimson from soaking up blood

GUS
You feel like talking now

Toph GARGLES in the affirmative his voice broken and
shaky

Gus removes the rag cuts Toph’ mouth free

AB blood types raise your hand

After a few awkward moments someone in the middle raises
his hand Gus pushes Toph toward him

GUS
Hurry up He’s lost a lot already

The man in the middle takes Toph carries him out The
rest of the men glare at Gus who charges into them with
the hammer blazing

The men attack Gus from all sides He’s hit many times
but he never goes down He is a whirling dervish
swinging the hammer with exactitude and ferocity For
every blow that Gus receives he dishes out five Knee
caps elbows jaws - all SHATTER from Gus’ blows

When they gang up on him stomping and kicking him on the
ground Gus fights back smashing toes and shins He
picks men up and topples them over It’s a ballet of
knuckles blood and pain

One by one the men drop like flies He fights his way
through the men all the way down the hall

opens twelve more THUGS cram the elevator ready to
fight

is shocked at what he sees it’s the same suicidal Man he
met on the roof of the building Coincidence

down the courtyard and past the fountain Though Mike

passes within a few feet of Gus he doesn’t see him

mirror behind the bar sips a beer poured from the tap

ANGLE ON MIKE flirting with a couple of WOMEN half his
age They younger women aren’t impressed by Mike but
accept the free drinks When Mike’s back is turned one
of the girls makes a face to her friend

bygone days Then catching his own reflection in the
mirror it all comes back to him He suddenly gets a
look of revulsion storms out

around When it’s clear he’s not going to buy anything-

CLERK

Mike exits the bar drunk SINGING old Billy Joel He
sloppily lights a cigarette when he hears his name
Turns around to see Gus standing there

TOPH (VO)

Anyone anywhere anyhow

Mike stares at Gus for several moments before a look of
recognition comes over him He lunges at his old friend
hugging him Tears gush down his red cheeks A mess

TOPH (VO) (CONTD)
Well make them sufferyou can watch
for a little extra

By contrast Gus’ face is a mask of cold indifference

INT MIKE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A bachelor’s apartment to a fault Mike and Gus sit on
his black leather couch listen to the audio cassette
Mike smokes once again

VOICE (VO)
I want him gone a long time but I don’t
want him crazy Angry desperate
vengeful yes Crazy no

TOPH (VO)
You’re in good hands We have
medication Anti-psychotics Quite
effective in most cases We’ve seen it
work well up to five years No doubt
longer But I guess it all depends on
the duration So how long is he

VOICE (VO)
Twenty years

Long silence

VOICE (VO) (CONTD)
I thought the length was up to me

TOPH (VO)
What did he do

VOICE (VO)
Gus you see he talks too much

CLICK Gus stops the tape He looks up at Mike

GUS
Who hates me this much

Mike thinks about it takes a long drag

MIKE
Whoever he is I hope I don’t know him

Gus stands walks to the window looking out at the city
Mike’s apartment has an impressive view

GUS
Mike Was I a good friend

Mike picks up his glass of whiskey and walks over to Gus

MIKE
Have a drink Gus Like old times

Gus shakes his head Mike walks back to the table sees
the ENVELOPE on the floor opens it Gus looks at the
envelope then over to Mike
MIKE (CONTD)
An invoice
(scanning the page)
Dated a few days ago
CLOSE ON PAPER

“Thank you for your business Final amount due

And an address “1616 Whitley Terrace Unit D”

CUT TO

EXT 1616 WHITLEY TERRACE - NIGHT

Gus stands outside for several moments before entering
the building

INT 1616 WHITLEY TERRACE

Gus takes the stairs two at a time until he’s standing
outside Unit D The door is open a crack Gus pushes it
open He tries the lights but the electricity is out

INT UNIT D

The apartment is barren If anyone lived here before
they’re long gone now Still Gus moves cautiously in
the dark apartment

LIVING ROOM

Gus rounds the corner to see a light on Two men stand
there One is dressed casually a genial smile on his
face This is STEVEN The other is large and muscled
dressed in a suit and tie Steven’s bodyguard LARRY

We recognize Steven as the same man who put him in the
taxi The suicidal man on the roof Gus stops dead in
his tracks

STEVEN
You should’ve stuck around to hear my
story

In a rage Gus charges and SLAMS him against the wall
Larry springs into action bringing a knife against Gus’s
throat

Steven holds his hand up signalling Larry to back off

GUS
Who are you

Steven smiles Gus SHAKES him

GUS (CONTD)
Tell me

STEVEN
(cold as steel with a smile)
Youll have to earn it

His smug reaction confuses Gus a bit but escalates his
rage

GUS
(gritting through his teeth)
I’m gonna fucking rip your heart out

STEVEN
(shrugging)
Then you’ll never know why I locked you
up

Gus’s mind races at the implication of Steven’s words

STEVEN (CONT’D)
Can you really live with that

GUS
Fuck you
STEVEN
You have five days to find out
GUS
FUCK YOU
STEVEN
After that I’1l kill everything you ever
loved

Gus’s hand wraps around Steven’s throat and he begins to
squeeze

Steven SNAPS his fingers and Larry drops a needle on a
turntable A record plays “Climb Every Mountain” Gus
falls to the floor crumbling limply in a heap Steven
steps over him

As Gus writhes on the floor paralyzed by the song
Steven looks outside the wall of glass across to another
building

STEVEN (CONT’D)
Youre really horrible at protecting your
women

Gus eyes struggle to look at Steven

STEVEN (CONT’D)
Like I said be it a pebble or grain of
sand in water they both sink alike
(singing)
Follow every byway every path you know
Climb every mountain

He nods to Larry the bodyguard and they head out

STEVEN (CONT’D)
You have five days

Gus strains to look out the window

He sees straight into Anna’s apartment She walks
towards the door as MEN force their way into the
apartment They grab onto her She struggles as they
violently force themselves upon her

We PAN back towards Gus’s face as he watches on The
rage and pain he feels at what he sees sends tears down
his cheek He can’t turn away forces himself not to
close his eyes and watch the horror unfold

Suddenly the song ends and the needle returns to its
cradle

The effects of the song ends and Gus retains power over
his body and is able to move once again Without missing
a beat Gus rushes out of the apartment

CUT TO

EXT ANNA’S APARTMENT

As Gus approaches the apartment he sees it’s open He
rushes in to find-

INT ANNA’S APARTMENT

The place is in shambles Several THUGS from the Stor-4-
U fight are crowded in waiting for Gus Many of them
wear bandages and walk with limps

ANNA SOBS when Gus enters still tied up Face bloody

A KNIFE is pressed against Gus’ throat and he’s forced
into a seat TOPH pulls up a chair across from him
smiles His front teeth have been replaced by PLATINUM
FILLERS

TOPH
Like ‘em Teeth are replaceable

Toph walks over to Anna
TOPH (CONTD)

I’m going to take something you can’t
replace

Toph runs his hands over her body - a show especially for
Gus who struggles futilely

Two men force Gus to face Toph who walks over towards
them One of his goons hands Gus a serrated hunting
knife which he points at Gus’s heart Slowly her runs
the knife towards Gus’s groin

Gus squirms as the knife brushes his pelvis Toph makes
a lunging motion -

Gus eyes closes as he screams with the hand muffling his
cry -

But nothing happens Gus was toying with him The thugs
LAUGH as Toph leans in close to Gus

TOPH (CONTD)
We always imagine it worse than it really
is
(beat)
Now get ready for the real thing

Toph puts the claw in Gus’ mouth again only this time
finding a tooth

KNOCK-KNOCK

Toph and company stop At the door is Larry Stevens
henchman He holds a briefcase

TOPH (CONTD)
What’s this

Larry FLIPS open the briefcase to reveal row after row of
neatly stacked hundreds Toph smiles that platinum
smile takes the briefcase

TOPH (CONTD)
(to Gus)
Lucky sonuva
(to his men)
Let’s go

They all start to head out but Toph gets a change of
heart Taking a bat from one of his men he rushes back
over to Gus and STRIKES him Then straightening
himself Toph and the thugs head out

GUS
Stay

Toph stops at the door

TOPH
What

Gus weakly crawls on the floor behind him

GUS
Stay and fight

A few of them SNICKER

GUS (CONTD)
I’m gonna cut your hands off

Toph sneers exits the apartment
GUS (CONTD)
You hear me
INT HALLWAY
As Toph and his men exit Gus’s voice echoes behind them-
TOPH
(to his men)

What about my tongue

They all LAUGH continue down the hall

INT ANNA’S APARTMENT

Gus shuts the door He turns his attention to Anna who
quietly whimpers He crawls partway then struggles to
stand Gaining his balance he walks over to her and
undoes the gag in her mouth

With the gag gone she gasps for air sobbing She tries
to scream but her dry throat won’t allow it

Gus works her hands free from the binds First one hand
then the other Exhausted she falls into his arms He
barely has any energy left to catch her She finally
stands on her own and pushes away from him

She looks into his eyes His apologetic Hers seething
with anger

With blinding speed she cocks her hand back and SLAPS
him Hard

He doesn’t react to the slap Her anger mounts and she
slaps him AGAIN

Soon her anger turns to despair and she begins to cry

Gus tries to comfort her trying to wrap his arms around
her She tries to get away from him pushing back but he
overpowers her With closed fists she beats at his
chest but her energy’s waning

ANNA
You did this

She finally falls into his arms sobbing into his chest

Without a word Gus lets Anna take her anger out until
she’s spent

ANNA (CONT’‘D)
Fuck you

With a delicate touch we’ve never seen from Gus he holds
her face into his hands He wipes the smeared mascara
running from her eyes
GUS
(in a whisper)
I won’t let anything happen to you again
She looks up at him

GUS (CONTD)
I promise

Her anger subsides Anna falls into his arms exhausted

CUT TO

LATER

Gus lays on the mattress awake He strokes her hair
Anna is curled up next to him grabbing onto him like a
security blanket sleeping

She stirs in her sleep She gasps and sits up breathing
hard She wakes from a nightmare looks around the room

Gus sits up behind her

GUS
Im right here You were having a
nightmare

She looks over to him touches his face to reassure
herself Satisfied she shifts and lies on his lap He
strokes her hair

GUS (CONTD)
Go back to sleep

Gus keeps stroking her hair to try and soothe her She
pushes his hand away roughly

ANNA
Don’t

Gus puts his hand back on her hair She tries to push
him away again

Gus catches her hands and holds them like a vice Then
he releases them gently and puts his hand back on her
hair and strokes it again

Anna looks away and lies down facing away from him
Tears stream down from her face

ANNA (CONTD)
I can’t make it stop

There’s a brief silence except for Anna’s sniffling She
wipes her eyes

ANNA (CONT’‘D)
I was fourteen My grandpa was a
preacher I was his perfect
granddaughter Always attended Sunday
School at the church

She struggles to continue - she needs to let this out

ANNA (CONT’‘D)
One Sunday after class the teacher asked
me to stay late to help him clean up

She gets choked up in tears

ANNA (CONTD)
His hands were so strong I couldn’t
stop him I tried

Gus closes his eyes pained for her

ANNA (CONTD)
When I told my grandpa he just looked at
me in this way Like I did something
wrong Like it was my fault He said he
would take care of it but he did
nothing

(beat)
(MORE)

ANNA (CONTD)

So every Sunday I had to face this
monster and I couldn’t say a word He’d
just smile and act like nothing happened
Id see him places around town always
with that same sick smile

GUS
Youre safe here

She breaks down sobbing As Gus holds her he can’t see
the concern that slowly washes over her face It’s clear
she doesn’t believe him

CUT TO

MORNING

Gus wakes still in his bloodied clothes He rubs his
eyes and sees that Anna is already gone

LATER

Gus is wiping down her table He gathers some loose
change Everything is in its place and organized After
wiping the table Gus inspects his work

CUT TO

LATER

Gus opens the small refrigerator and peers in He takes
a survey of what’s in there but there’s not much

He closes the door and thinks for a second before walking
back to the table He looks into the bowl and dips his
finger inside pushing the money around counting it in
his head He pauses for a beat and thinks for a second

CUT TO

EXT BODEGA

Gus walks out of the bodega with a bag full of groceries
He pauses outside as he walks by the fresh flower stand
He stares at the flower and at the woman cutting the
stems off the flowers

He reaches into his pocket and counts what money he has
left He looks over the flowers and spots a pretty but
inexpensive bouquet

CUT TO

INT ANNA’S APARTMENT —- EVENING

Gus stares at her small dining table The table is set
for a dinner he’s cooked The flowers have been placed
into a makeshift vase in the middle of the setting

He goes over to a basket near the entry way and grabs
some matchbooks He takes one and lights candles tosses
the matchbooks aside He looks at everything pleased

CUT TO

INT ANNA’S APARTMENT - LATER

The candles have burned down One has blown out
completely

Gus sits in one of the chairs staring at the clock on the
wall Anna’s late Frustrated he walks towards the
window and looks outside

After a few moments he comes back to the table He
notices the blown out candle and goes for the matchbooks
He lights the candle and takes a look at the matchbook
cover It’s a picture of a cue ball with the number 13
On the opposite end the words CLUB 13 He looks over
to the other matchbooks and they are all the same

EXT CLUB THIRTEEN

Gus walks up to small unassuming doors and a large glass
window It’s more a neighborhood bar than an actual
club but it’s got music blasting inside and it’s packed

Gus peers in through the window and sees Anna inside

She has a drink in hand and flirtatiously leans against a
wall as a YOUNG MAN stands over her his hand bracing the
wall The young man leans in and kisses her neck She
turns away sees Gus staring at her through the window
She looks away from Gus and pulls the Young Man closer to
her giving him a deep long kiss

He’s seen enough Gus charges through the doors

INT CLUB THIRTEEN

Gus plows through the mostly young crowd He sticks out
like a sore thumb

He pushes people aside brusquely until he finds Anna in
the back corner with the young man She looks briefly at
Gus then tries to ignore him

Gus moves the Young Man aside and takes Anna by her hand

ANNA
I needed a drink

The Young Man has spilled his drink on himself looks at
Gus perturbed

YOUNG MAN
This guy bothering you

Gus whirls around and looks at the Young Man with an
angry but focused expression

GUS
Leave

He turns from him in condescending fashion trains his
attention back to Anna

GUS (CONT’D)
Let’s go

Anna rips her hand from his

ANNA
I’m not going anywhere Leave me alone

She moves towards the young man and wraps her arm around
him She looks straight into Gus’ eyes and then kisses
the Young Man in front of him her hand trailing down to
his crotch

YOUNG MAN
(shit-eating grin)
I think she likes me

Gus grabs onto Anna once again and drags her with him
She tries to fight but can’t free herself

The Young Man grabs onto Gus’ shoulder and turns him
around

YOUNG MAN (CONTD)
Listen you old fuck

BIG MISTAKE

Without letting go of Anna’s hand Gus swings at the
Young Man CRUNCH Gus connects with the Young Man’s
nose and blood flies everywhere The Young Man staggers
back and falls to the ground

He grabs Anna but she fights him tooth and nail makes
a scene SECURITY shows up A BOUNCER pushes up on Gus
but - BAM - he gets a face full of fist She SCREAMS
Gus drags Anna out almost carrying her out the door

The crowd keeps away from Gus not wanting to receive his

wrath while others go in the aid of the Young Man whose
face is covered in his own blood

EXT CLUB THIRTEEN

Gus carries Anna out the door in a giant bear hug She
kicks and screams

ANNA
Let me go you asshole

Gus puts her down

GUS
Stop screaming

ANNA
Fuck you

GUS

You want to act like a little girl I’m
going to treat you like one

Anna struggles a bit more then realizes it’s no use

ANNA
Youre hurting me

Gus puts her down and but keeps hold of her hand He
walks down the street pulling her behind him

INT ANNA’S APARTMENT

Gus drags Anna inside and pushes her into the apartment
roughly Anna almost falls by the force She comes
inside the apartment and looks around She stares at the
set-up in the dining table Gus stands there embarrassed
by everything She looks over to him

He doesn’t answer

She walks over to the table then suddenly swipes the
setting off with her hand sending dishes to the floor

Gus looks at her stunned and hurt - it’s not the reaction
he was hoping for

ANNA
I didn’t ask for this

She takes a snort of cocaine Gus walks over to her

GUS
How long you been doing that shit

Anna takes a swing at him but he catches her hand

ANNA
Get the fuck out I want you to leave

She tries to push him towards the door

ANNA (CONTD)
Just like everyone else You get your
fix then your gone

She hits him with her fists One lands cutting Gus on
the lip He tries to catch her flailing arms as she
begins to attack Tears are streaming from her face
Gus finally grabs hold of her hands

GUS
That was the past That’s not me

ANNA
It never changes

She struggles again but Gus restrains her In the heat
of the struggle Gus grabs her face and kisses her She
resists For a moment

ANNA (CONT’‘D)
Leave me alone

Then the passion takes over Soon they are grasping at
each others’ bodies Taking off clothes while their lips
devour each other This release is heated and just about
as violent as their struggle

They tumble towards the mattress Their bodies cling to
each other in desperation

Undressed Gus lays on top of Anna kissing her breasts
and moving up her neck until finding her lips

Anna moans in ecstasy She grabs his head forcefully and
feeds him with a kiss

They begin to make love

CLOSE on Annas face - a cross between pain and pleasure
She bites her lip to keep from screaming as Gus enters
her They make passionate love thats mixed with fear
violence and love

TIME CUT

Gus and Anna lie naked in each other’s arms He strokes
her arm gently She closes her eyes Bliss

CUT TO

BATHROOM

Gus and Anna take a bath together take turns soaping
each other up She splashes him LAUGHS

CUT TO

LIVING ROOM

The drone of a hairdryer Anna sits on the floor head
bowed as Gus kneels behind her blow-drying her hair with
one hand brushing it out with the other

Finally he turns the machine off As he continues
brushing she lets off a satisfied sigh

LATER

Anna leans back against Gus Suddenly she looks at him
Her face grows serious Anna gets up goes to the
closet She pulls out a shoebox brings it over to the
bed

GUS
What are you doing
ANNA
Something I should’ve done a long time

ago

She opens the box and we see that it’s filled with
mementos Pictures of old boyfriends love letters
poems

ANNA (CONT’‘D)
I don’t know why I held on to these for
so long

She grabs a pair of scissors starts cutting pictures in
half throws them in the trash

Gus looks at a poem but she snaps it out of his hand
tosses it in the trash

She cuts and cuts and cuts Picture after picture falls
into the trash ex-boyfriend after ex-boyfriend

She takes the whole box and turns it over dumping
everything into the trash A total purging Anna finds
this somewhat exhilarating

Gus looks down at a picture Something about the face
pulls him closer The color begins to drain from his
face

CLOSE ON PHOTO

One that Anna didn’t cut yet A familiar face He has
his arms around Anna their hair mussed

GUS staggers back in shock He looks at Anna as though
she just plunged a knife into his belly

ANNA (CONTD)
What

She goes to him takes a look at the picture Gus can’t
look at her He shoves the picture back

ANNA (CONTD)
(with growing alarm)
That’s Steven We just went on a few
dates

GUS
It’s HIM

ANNA
Who

Anna is starting to panic

ANNA (CONT’‘D)
What do you mean

Now he looks at her full on His gaze overpowering
condemning

GUS
How did you meet

ANNA

BEAT Then the inevitable moment of dread-

GUS
Did you FUCK him

She looks away eyes averted He takes a deep breath

pops open Immediately Evergreen types

“Hello Gus Was she good”
Gus PUNCHES the wall losing his mind

GUS (CONT’D)
He watches my every move

ANNA
I can’t do this right now

Gus stares at the screen name pacing
Another message follows
“You have three days”

Evergreen disappears from her buddy list On screen it
says

“Evergreen has logged off”

Gus paces once again Anna feels terrible starts to
cry

GUS
Can’t fucking believe this

But his words only make it worse She can’t stop now
He grabs her up in a tight embrace almost too tight

Anna sobs into his strong arms She feels both comfort
and uncertainty Security mixed with abject fear

Anna sits with Gus flipping through a yearbook A
LIBRARIAN scrutinizes them

He gets to the ‘R’s But there is no Steven

GUS
No Steven Riordan in any grade

ANNA

just look at the faces

He slides the book aside frustrated He looks out the
window Meanwhile Anna opens the book again flips to
thru the women’s section

GUS (VO)
High school was a prison I left and never
looked back Now I’m forced to look but
I can’t see a thing What crime
committed here could deserve such a
punishment

An envelope falls out Gus picks it up It’s a coupon
for a hair salon called Susan’s Hair Creations He looks
at it for a beat before pocketing it

GUS (CONTD)
That’s the girls’ section

ANNA
I know I saw something

She stops at a name Caroline Riordan

ANNA (CONTD)
Caroline Riordan

The name strikes a chord with Gus His mind races he
looks around as if the walls are closing in on him

ANNA (CONT’‘D)
Do you remember her

He looks out the window to a kiosk in front of the
school A GIRL stands there holding her book bag
waiting to be picked up Gus stares at her something
about the visual brings him back to

A strikingly beautiful girl with long brunette hair and
piercing blue eyes stands by the same kiosk years
earlier This is CAROLINE RIORDAN 17 She looks around
the empty parking lot waiting for someone

YOUNG GUS stands nearby on his bike smoking a cigarette
He looks at his watch then glances up at Caroline She
flashes a quick smile then turns away coyly

Gus stares at her awestruck Slowly he approaches

She senses him coming tries to look busy by looking at
the kiosk full of flyers and announcements

Gus clears his throat She is looking at a flyer
CLOSE ON the flyer - an audition for a play MEDEA

GUS (contd)
You thinking about auditioning

Awkward silence

GUS (CONTD)
You should I bet you’1ll get it

Caroline smiles

CAROLINE
Oh yeah How about you

Gus scoffs

GUS

GUS
Why would I wanna be cool

Caroline looks at the cigarette Gus looks at it too
which he flicks to the floor and stamps with his feet

In the distance a teenager stands looking at them
STEVEN RIORDAN 16 quiet and unassuming with a camera
strapped around his neck

She heads towards her brother Then pauses and turns to
him

Gus drives along the streets towards the quiet town of
Evergreen His mind races

Anna sits next to him staring at the sights outside

ANNA
So what was she like

Gus ponders the question but doesn’t answer

Outside a school bus drives down on the opposite side of
the street Gus looks at it briefly A boy on a bike
follows behind the slow moving bus struggling to keep
up It’s Young Gus Gus looks at Young Gus pedalling
away through his rear view mirror

EXT STREET —- DAY (FLASHBACK)

Young Gus pedals furiously as the school bus makes
several stops Young Gus cuts through a small park area -
a short cut

The bus stops and Caroline gets off the bus She walks
across the street to a PUBLIC BUS stop where she meets up
with her brother Steven

The public bus makes a stop and Caroline and Steven get
off the bus In the distance Young Gus watches from his
bike

Caroline and Steven walk towards their home Steven
reaches for his sister’s hand to hold it Caroline
shakes free from his grasp

Gus watches this interaction That was odd
He starts pedalling slowly making sure he’s undetected

CUT TO

EXT STREET —- DAY (FLASHBACK)

A low income neighborhood The street is lined with
small homes that have not been maintained

Caroline and Steven walk into their house - paint
peeling grass overgrown junk piled everywhere

Young Gus rides his bike up and stand behind a tree
watching the house hoping to get a glimpse of Caroline

Suddenly from inside the house through a window he sees
a figure of an older man their FATHER He looks unkempt
and scraggly his shirt unbuttoned He’s screaming at -

Caroline enters the window fear in her eyes

FATHER
Don’t you walk away from me

Her father grabs her hand and pushes her close to him
She pushes him back struggling to get away He slaps
her hard Caroline manages to get free and runs out of
the house She runs to the side of the house away and
leans up against the wall crying her hand feeling her
stinging face

Steven runs out looking for her He approaches slowly
He goes up to her and hugs her She cries into his
shoulder He holds her face in his hands He leans
infor a kiss He’s about to kiss her on the lips but
she turns the last minute and he gives her a tender kiss
on the cheek

Gus watches on There’s something unnerving about their
interaction - something wrong He feels like he’s
witnessed something taboo presses against a tree to keep
from being seen

EXT DOWNTOWN EVERGREEN —- DAY (PRESENT)

The image of Young Gus appears as a reflection on a store
front window that disappears as Present Day Gus stares at
it He takes out the flyer for the hair salon and walks
down the street filled with quaint stores and boutiques

He looks back towards his car sees Anna sitting there
looking out the window at him

He looks back down the street Across from where he
stands he spots a small hair salon with a sign reading
SUSAN’S HAIR CREATIONS

From a nearby coffee shop SUSAN ANDRUCKI 40s exits
with coffee in her hand She saunters through the shop
looking at her hair through a store window’s reflection
She waves at other store owners and passerby’s before
entering the shop

Gus crosses the street heading for the salon

Susan runs her fingers flirtatiously through his hair
She walks behind him and unbuttons her top button on her
blouse She circles him and leans over letting him get
an eyeful of her full breasts Gus just stares at her
expressionless looks beyond her to the mirror

Gus watches his reflection as he gets groomed looking
better and cleaner

Susan sighs realizing his disinterest

his hands He closes his eyes and lets the memories
take over When he looks at the stage again he sees

Two young boys A young Mike and a young Gus smoke
cigarettes on stage carrying paint and brushes

Its a flashback but the present Gus exists in the same
space

Gus quietly looks on remembering

brushes As Gus works he smokes a lit cigarette half-
dangling out of his mouth

YOUNG MIKE

Mike gives Gus the finger steps back to admire his paint
job Gus flicks his cigarette on the ground stamps it
out with his foot

looks around He makes sure hes alone and pulls out a
joint from his pocket

Gus enters the darkened theater Spotlights are
positioned on stage as a young woman stands there

All he can see is the young and beautiful Caroline
reciting lines

CAROLINE
Come flame by sky Pierce through my
head What do I gain from living any
longer Oh how I hate living I want to
end my life leave it behind and die

She looks straight at him piercing him with her dark
eyes as though looking straight into his soul

He closes his eyes and looks again

The young woman is not Caroline at all just an actress
rehearsing

Gus shakes his head trying to shake the image from his
mind

echoing in the empty theater Gus looks around trying to

spot the source

The lights go out All that remains is the spotlight
focused on the stage

From the darkness a dark figure emerges into the
spotlight Steven stands on stage CLAPPING

STEVEN

Congratulations You made it just in

time
Furious Gus runs up to the stage bum-rushing Steven
He tackles him to the ground and starts pummeling him
mercilessly
Steven doesnt make a move not even to avoid being hit
Gus continues the onslaught of punches to Steves face

Stevens head whips back as he spits out blood

Gus pauses trying to catch his breath He seems animal-
like

Steve looks at him bruised and bloody works a smile on
his lips It looks like he may be enjoying this

Go ahead kill me Then youll miss the
best part

Gus gets up off him Steven smiles through the blood

Gus watches him go cautious Is this a trap

pictures On closer inspection we see that the pictures
are mostly of Caroline Riordan At the center is a large
striking picture of Caroline trying to look happy
Behind her is a blurred picture of a river Gus looks
stares at the haunting picture

Steven gathers himself looking at a mirror wiping the
blood from his face

STEVEN

hes slept with his own daughter

STEVEN

Steven gets up and takes out a gun Gus stares at it
with a look of dread and longing Steven smiles

STEVEN

her gaze to the box

INT PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

Gus gets a look of rage He curls his fingers into fists
as he storms behind Steven That’s when Larry steps in
blocking his path

Gus throws several punches but Larry is a seasoned
fighter They crash into each other like fierce
animals Larry brings Gus to the ground trying to choke
him out But Gus outmaneuvers him and gains leverage

He jabs Larry in the throat wrenches his arm too far to
the left - SNAP Larry isn’t giving up grabs a clump of
Gus’ hair Gus head-butts him causing blood to gush
from Larry’s nose

He leaves Larry on the ground squirming scrambles to pick
up the gun but Steven has it in his hands He points it
at Gus’s head He motions for Gus to get up on his feet

GUS
Please Im begging you Dont show it
to her This is all my fault Dont
punish her

Gus gets up defeatedblubbering

GUS (CONTD)
(beat)
Ill do anything Anything you want

Steven looks away from him and back to the picture

Steven stares into Carolines eyes - a flash of anger
that subsides as quickly as it came

Steven wraps his arm around Gus as they stand side by
side facing opposite directions Steven points the gun
to Gus’s temple One bullet and they both die

STEVEN
The only thing I did wrong was to love
her Gus

Gus opens his eyes stops trembling

STEVEN (CONTD)
We loved each other and we were willing
to live with that fact
(beat)
Now the question is can you

Steven picks up the phone with his free hand and dials
He waits a beat until someone on the other line picks up

STEVEN (CONT’D)
(on the phone)
Let her go

Hearing these words sparks Gus into action He grabs the
gun from Steven - and in the blink of an eye - spins
around and pulls the trigger

The bullet flies through the air and lands in Stevens
head - flies out the other end

For a moment there is nothing bus silence

Gus and Steven stare at each other a moment of unity and
understanding Steven’s face looks serene as if he’s
finally reached some inner peace He falls back dead

Gus stands there with the gun still smoking in his hand

INT ROOM - NIGHT

Toph hears nothing but silence over the phone

He reaches for the gift box hesitates

Then he lifts the cover She takes out the album

Toph gets up off the chair and pulls out a train ticket
from his pocket

here as possible

He throws the ticket on the bed and exits leaving the
door wide open

A small town diner
Anna again working as a waitress takes an order

There’s something different about her She looks older
more mature a bit distant — sadness lingers in her eyes

The BELLS of the door ring signalling a new customer
entering She turns towards the door and sees

Gus who also looks older and a bit worn down They
regard each other for a bit not moving not saying
anything

He looks at her longingly Hes torn by his decision
but knows he can’t stay away
