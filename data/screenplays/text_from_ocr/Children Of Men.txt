INT CAFE -- DAY

Men and women standing looking up Sad and hopeless Their
middle-aged faces bathed in the pale light of the television
they are silently watching

TV VOICE
Baby Diego was killed in a bar fight in
Buenos Aires after refusing to sign an
autograph

A man enters the coffee shop making his way through the
people THEO FARON Detached unkempt scruffy beard
glasses Theo is a veteran of hopelessness He gave up
before the world did

TV VOICE

and Sandra Ricardo a working class
couple from Buenos Aires

Theo wedges his way to the counter He orders

THEO
Coffee Black

Next to him a 50-year-old woman stares up at the TV
cradling a small dog tears rolling down her face Theo
waits glancing at the old plasma TV without much interest

ON TV The face of “Baby” DIEGO the most famous boy in
the world a fair-haired teenager who has never lacked
anything smiling a practiced smile

TV VOICE
Baby Diego struggled his entire life with
the celebrity status thrust upon him by
being the world’s youngest person

ON TV Stock footage of Diego’s life His baby portrait

Different accounts suggest that Diego
spat in the face of a Zed who asked for
an autograph which began the fight that
ended in his death The Zed was lynched
by the angry crowd shortly thereafter

and starts to make his way out Passing through the crowd
Other people crying Two grizzled POLICEMEN sip coffee
watching the news

8 minutes old

Theo leaves the cafe

EXT CAFE -- DAY

Theo walks out with his coffee facing the day People
walking along quietly bundled up Some with dogs It’s
cold It’s wet It’s sad It’s London

SUPER LONDON 2024 AD

A short distance from the cafe Theo sets his coffee cup atop
a post box Slow traffic rolls past Mostly “old” cars ‘08
models some older A couple of ‘18s Motorized rickshaws
scoot around the edges A double decker bus passes with
metal mesh on the windows Bicycles

A billboard showing a stern-faced leader flanked by the
idealized profiles soldiers and policemen “KEEPING ENGLAND
ALIVE” Surveillance cameras on lamp posts and building
sides with tiny disclaimers “For Your Protection”

Theo takes out a flask from his pocket unscrews the top
about to pour it into his coffee when behind him --

KA-BOOM A BOMB EXPLODES inside the cafe blowing out the
windows rocking the ground

Theo reels with the blast knocked off balance

Smoke pours through the shattered facade of the cafe Wails
of PAIN as people stagger out covered in residue holding
their wounds bleeding A woman misSing an arm

Theo regains his balance shell-shocked holding his ears

FADE TO BLACK

( )

TITLE “THE CHILDREN OF MEN”
FADE IN
INT TRAIN - DAY

Through a train window covered by steel mesh a billboard
passing by “GIVE HUMANITY A HAND - GET A FERTILITY TEST”

Theo rubs his ringing ears watching the desolate green
landscape

POCK POCK Projectiles smack against side of the train
the steel mesh protecting the windows Theo looks

A gang is hurling rocks and bottles 20-year-old males some
with painted faces -- these are ZEDS The youngest
generation on earth nothing to lose it all ends with them

After throwing their load the Zeds recede disappearing
behind a billboard “IS YOUR NEIGHBOR A TERRORIST REPORT
ALL SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY”

VOICE
Fucking zeds Hurl a few rocks crawl
back into their cracks

Theo looks back to the train Two middle-aged COPS face him
on the opposite seat commuting home after a long day

COP 1

It’s our fault We indulged the whiney
pricks for too long The last
generation End of the line Big deal

(gestures to Cop 2)
Rick’s boy he’s what 20 He got dealt
the same hand He didn’t quit Good
boy that Scottie Joined the force
what a year ago

COP 2
Uh huh

Cop 2 fumbles with something in his hand a strip of pills

COP 1
Two weeks ago he and some other rookies
walked into a Zed ambush A real zedding
Outnumbered two to one three to one --
hell seven to one When we got there
later the floor was covered with blood
Blood and teeth Zed’s teeth And the
rookiesnot a bloody seratch

(MORE )

CoP 1 (CONTD)
They pummelled the pissant Zeds You
could almost feel sorry for them Those
zeds have numbers but no discipline no
technique And more important no pride

COP 2
Yeh

Cop 2 pops one of the pills into his mouth
cop 1
Pride That’s what set us apart That’s
why England’s still alive Look at the
rest of the world It’s hell out there

Theo looks out the window Graffiti on a wall “LAST PERSON
TO DIE PLEASE TURN OFF THE LIGHTS”

EXT TRAIN STATION -- AFTERNOON

Theo steps off the train Policemen patrol the platform
some with German Shepherds He looks around spotting an
older man across the way He walks toward him

JASPER
Hey amigo

THEO
How’s it going

JASPER
Quite groovy Quite quite groovy

EXT RURAL ROAD -- DUSK

Abandoned fields with ruined farms exhausted barns that look
like scarecrows

A car crosses its headlights cutting through the darkening
blue passing machinery rusting on the fallow land A Volvo
sedan circa 2009 not mint but still reliable

Then they blame Foogies the 5 Fishes or

Right after it went off there were some
wounded crawling out A bloody woman
holding the hind of a dog And the
people on the street walking by

JASPER
What did you do
THEO

be too much grief to bear

Theo smiles The headlights illuminate a wooded area
EXT WOODED ROAD -- DUSK

The Volvo slows down and makes a left turn going off the
road stopping in front the woods

Jasper and Theo get out Jasper walks to the middle of the
empty road looking both ways

JASPER
(starting a joke)
So there’s this supper Scientists and
wise men you know Human Project that
sort of bullocks

THEO
(rolling with it)
Yeah

Assured the coast is clear Jasper walks toward a row of
bushes in front of the trees illuminated by the headlights

JASPER
They’re throwing around theories about
the ultimate question how is it that
human beings haven’t had babies in 18
years

Theo walking with Jasper toward the bushes

JASPER
The biologist blames genetic experiments
that altered DNA The environmentalist
says that pollution and bio-experiments
poisoned the water You know the
typical jada jada

Jasper removes one of the bushes -- it’s not rooted

JASPER
A New Age bloke claims Mama Nature is
merely protecting herself

Theo removes another bush This is a false hedge hiding a
tiny dirt path behind it

JASPER
Then they all look at this English
scientist who hasn’t said a word he
just keeps eating

Jasper stops Theo

JASPER

They ask him “So what do you think
Why don’t people have babies anymore”
The English bloke looks at them he’s
chewing on a wing

(thick English accent)
“IT haven’t a clue” he says “But this
stork is quite lovely isn’t it”

Jasper playfully hits Theo

JASPER
Waaah You get it -- he’s eating a stork

THEO
(smiles)
Stork That’s funny

JASPER
She feels worthless She feels a burden
to me When she’s lucid she remembers
what we used to be

Through the windshield in a clearing in the trees visible
in the last light of day a low-tech jury-rigged eco-house
complete with primitive solar panels and a grass roof

INT JASPER’S HOUSE -- NIGHT

The Stones’ “Ruby Tuesday” plays JANICE sits ina

out
INT JASPER‘S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

the pictures of those starving wretches
in Ethiopia Same thing only blond He
said hed escaped from Bexhill They dug
a tunnel under the fence and came over
200 of them Mostly French Spaniards

(emphasis for Theo)
a few Americans They were crossing
no man’s land Soldiers caught them
Lined them up shot them down 200
hundred refugees Unarmed Bam Just

didn’t make the news

THEO
Not surprising

JASPER
Somehow this bloke escaped got through
no man’s land got over that hill I
gave him some food Amigo he told me
some spooky stories about what’s
happening in Europe Atrocities youd
never believe And the look in his eyes

Jasper eats a spoonful of soup looking at Theo

JASPER
It’s sick What humans can do to each
other

Theo ponders a potato

into bloom Theo and Jasper chill Jasper rolling a joint

JASPER

of your ration

personally In 80 years humanity will
disappear So what Ninety-eight
percent of the species that roamed around
earth have gone extinct

Jasper takes another hit

Theo nods

THEO
The dinosaurs had a pretty good run of
it Now it’s our turn What would we be
so damn special Just because we left
behind a few interesting piles of rocks

And some books Some really awesome
books And those really smashing
symphonies

INT JASPER’S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Janice still staring at the wall Theo comes to her He
takes the hair brush she is holding And begins brushing her
long gray hair

Among the photos on the wall one taken at a demonstration
catches Theo’s attention a younger Janice and Jasper
locking arms with Theo defiant and long-haired and a young
woman with the same attitude Theo carries a 2-year-old boy
in a baby backpack A placard for “Global Democracy” can be
read behind them

INT THEO’S APARTMENT - DAY

Through a window we see identical functional apartment
buildings on a foggy morning Next to the window an old
plasma wide-screen TV displays the time

A digit changes -- 830 The TV turns on

ON TV A woman reads the morning news War torn streets
Militia’s marching Citizens watching fearfully out their
windows A 50-year-old soldier in fatigues and beret a
Dixie flag flying behind gives a speech to a crowd in front
of the ruined facade of Camden Yards

TV VOICE
the American city of Baltimore fell to
the Southern Alliance after months of
furious street battles It is seen as
the biggest setback to the national
government since the invasion of Northern
California by the Oregon Alliance The
national government in DC has steadily
lost popular support since its bombing of
Cincinnati seven years ago in an attempt
to eradicate militia strongholds

Reflected in the window CLICK a light on a side table goes
on A form gets up slowly sitting up on a bed it’s Theo
shaking out the cobwebs his head foggier than London

against a brick wall Police dogs growl and sniff at their

The moment where the past and the future
meet is the tip of both cones

INT LECTURE ROOM -- DAY

Theo somewhat animated draws two “V” cones on a black
board the tips touching each other

THEO

This tip is not only a moment It’s a
perception and there are as many
perceptions as people on this planet

Theo faces the sizeable lecture room three quarters empty

Students stare back at him blankly People in sleeping bags
in back A man snores in the front row his pants wet the

urine dripping to the floor

THEO
Any questions

EXT STREET -- DAY

SIRENS screaming from police cars racing by disappearing
into the distance

Theo walks on the sidewalk A billboard soothing graphics
blue on blue “QUIETUS -- you can find relief”

The sidewalk strewn with trash lethargic breeze A young
couple embracing kissing in the open

Theo walks by leather case over his shoulder He’s holding
a book reading as he walks “Salem’s Lot” by Stephen King

The young couple breaks their embrace They begin to follow
Theo from behind He does not notice reading about a boy
who got himself locked inside a vampire’s room

The couple follows pulling ski masks over their heads

As Theo approaches the corner a van appears on the street
skidding to a stop blocking his path He slows down

A motorcycle comes from behind skidding to a stop blocking
his street side Theo pauses confused --

The ski masked couple upon him he pulling out a burlap sack
she pulling out a pistol

And the van door slides open showing a masked man holding a
semi-automatic gun

Theo reacts backing away --
The woman sticks the gun into his ribs whispering an order

WOMAN
Quiet

The burlap sack comes over Theo’s head She shoves him
through the van door

The motorcycle revs ready to go The man hops on behind

The woman jumps into the van the door slides shut

(

The motorcycle peels off in one direction
The van tears off the other way

Theo reacts taken aback The woman sits down facing him

THEO

from a Chinese fortune cookie

The woman takes the mask off JULIAN TAYLOR is Theo’s age
and although life has taken a harder toll on her she still
radiates the beauty of someone who believes A scar runs
along the side of her face

Theo is stunned He recovers with a smirk

THEO

six years

She smiles

JULIAN
(to the others)
I met Theo when we were 20 during an
anti-globalization demonstration in

while chanting “WTO OUT”

Julian locks eyes with Theo

JULIAN
(chanting)

“WTO OUT WTO OUT” And by time the
police attacked we were making out We
kissed as the tears ran down our faces
from the tear gas We fell in love We
were going to change the world -- our
love was going to change the world You
know the John and Yoko bug

Though Julian addresses the half dozen people in the room

her eyes on Theo They are the only two without hoods He
checks his coat

( )

THEO

JULIAN

JULIAN
We got shy stopped at our underwear

the sculpture And we threw away the
key Full commitment Now were waiting

empty theatre He walks down the aisle He takes a seat

INT QUIETUS AUDITORIUM -- Day

Rolling clouds across a glorious blue sky touched with
colors of a gently fading sun a glimpse of heaven You
almost don’t notice the pixels

Profiles of faces lying down on soft pads staring at the
clouds projected on the ceiling Mostly older men and women
some middle-agers and a few in their youth Soothing music
suffuses the ambience and a gentle female voice

VOICE
Forgiveness Experience forgiveness
Dwell in forgiveness Forgiveness
towards those who purposely caused you
pain Forgiveness Forgiveness towards
those who unwittingly caused you pain
Forgiveness Forgiveness towards
yourself Forgiveness Forgiveness
Dwell in forgiveness

The participants rest on the floor as if entering a gentle
sleep They are dying

It’s peaceful It’s inviting It’s Quietus

Attendants dressed in white gently administer to each
participant Holding them Offering each a cup to drink
from After they have drunk they are laid gently back down
ABOVE - BEHIND THE GLASS

A few dozen people arrayed on the bleacher seats Some are
there to observe loved ones make their final passage Others
are just looking for a warm place to sleep

Theo arrives harried -- he has rushed to get there He
looks around the vast bleacher section and finds

Jasper standing by the glass looking below Theo approaches
JASPER
She left a note I didn’t get here in
time
Theo stands next to him

JASPER
They say it is a peaceful way to go

Though the window they see

BELOW - ON THE MAIN FLOOR

An Attendant approaches Janice Her face is not the blank
mask of before -- her eyes are moist with profound awareness
of the end

The Attendant holds up the cup Janice reaches her hand
towards it shaking The Attendant steadies her hand her
hand around it Janice drinks

VOICE
Gratitude Immerse yourself in
gratitude Gratitude Gratitude for
those who brought you joy Gratitude
Gratitude for those who brought you pain
Gratitude Gratitude for your unique
journey Gratitude Gratitude Dwell
in gratitude

Janice’s grip slips from the cup Her entire body relaxes
The Attendant gently lays her down on the soft pad

ABOVE BEHIND THE GLASS
Jasper and Theo watching

JASPER

We had just moved to Paris We didn’t
have much a mattress a couch We were
doing really bad with dough That day
I got back early from the Sorbonne And
I saw her from the window coming home
carrying flowers There was this curtain
that was our closet and I hid behind it

Through the glass behind them a disturbance An Old Man
resists the cup offered to him knocking it away The lights
on the main floor cut out

JASPER
(continues )
And I watched her She put the flowers
in a drinking glass and she sat on the
sofa looking at them

The lights go up on the main floor everything returned to
its state of peace The Old Man lays completely still

JASPER
(continues )
She was humming that “I love Paris in the
springtime” song Very softly Lost in
her reveries
(MORE )

( )

JASPER (CONTD)
She stayed there just like that
Looking at the flowers For a long time
And you know what she was doing She was
picking her nose She always did that
when she thought nobody was watching her
Did you ever notice

THEO
(lying)

JASPER
That’s what she did She picked her
nose

With her pinky

The Zeds swarm over the man who disappears under their
onslaught A moment later the Zeds retreat back to the
darkness One Zed left behind staggering holding a wound

TV VOICE

by the victim or by one of his own gang

The wounded Zed falls to his knees beside the man who lays
motionless on the sidewalk naked picked clean

The driver is barely holding a dangling body hardly able to
keep the motorcycle upright

The 1st Policeman keeps walking The 2nd Policeman yanks the
Refugee out of his seat dragging by his hair to the front of
the bus pushing him off The Refugee is shoved into the
group of kneeling refugees

In the bus the dog starts barking Theo Miriam and Kee
tense as the dog drags the ist Policeman forward The dog
is in now front of Kee barking at her smelling something it
has never smelled before

The lst Policeman looks at Kee she is breathing hard
clutching the tube of the seat in front of her looking at
the floor in the middle of a contraction

POLICEMAN

Miriam is frozen The dog barking The Policeman yanks Kee
up by her hair twisting her face toward him

at Theo with relief

EXT CHECK POINT - NIGHT

The bus rumbles to life lurching forward heading through a
steel fenced corridor

INT IMMIGRATION CONTROL BUS -- NIGHT

Out the window we see the corridor fenced in steel
reinforced with razor wire hopeless faces looking through
the gaps The BEXHILL FENCE

EXT BEXHILL -- NIGHT

The bus is parked Refugees pile out guard dogs barking at
their heels Theo and Miriam helping Kee down

It’s a chaosof people Guards wield night sticks herding
the group to the final gate

Approaching the threshold Theo sees a sign framing the gate
“ACCEPTANCE IS ENDURANCE”

EXT RUINED SQUARE -- CONTINUOUS

Theo Kee and Miriam emerge from the gate looking around
disoriented lost

This is Bexhill What used to be an industrial port town is
now a sealed-off refugee camp barely lit by occasional
street lamps with uneven current

Kee suddenly stops doubling up -- a new contraction The
flow of refugees keeps pushing behind them pushing them
forward Kee stopping pain --

KEE
BLOODY HELL

Miriam holding Kee for support

MIRIAM
(urgent)
She‘s about to deliver this baby

A man walking past looking at them curiously Pale skin
knit cap hook nose

Theo sees the statue of a soldier

THEO
Wait here

Theo heads to the statue a WWI soldier holding a bayonet
rifle charging The plaque reads “Lost Generation” Theo
walks around the pedestal

YAP YAP A tiny runt dog nips at his heels scaring the
hell out of him

THEO

Theo turns to see a woman MARICHKA Olive skin 40 the
exhausted eyes of someone who accepts the hardship of life as
fate She knows when to duck

EXT RICKSHAW - NIGHT

Theo helps Kee into a motorized rickshaw Miriam already
sitting in back Marichka sits in front wrapped in a old
wool coat the dog on her lap

Miriam looks back anxiously Theo turns and sees the Hook-
Nosed man walking towards them

THEO
You know him

MIRIAM
I might Let’s go
(to Marichka)
Go

Marichka revs the rickshaw into motion Through the back
window the Hook-Nosed man runs after them but he can’t
catch the accelerating rickshaw He recedes behind them
MIRIAM
A few months ago one of the Bexhill
fences was blown up A big group of
Foogies stampeded through the hole

THEO
I saw the news

MIRIAM
The Foogie escape was a only smoke
screen What we were actually doing was
smuggling some of our people inside To
organize cells

THEO
Smoke screen killed lots of Foogies

MIRIAM
I know but it was Luke’s plan He
believed we needed strong cells in
Bexhill He called them missionaries

EXT STREETS OF BEXHILL -- NIGHT

The rickshaw crosses through the dark streets Small jury-
rigged plastic tents around the sidewalks People warming
their hands around scattered piles of burning rubbish --
watching suspiciously at the passing rickshaw

EXT RICKSHAW - DRIVING -- CONTINUOUS

Kee coming out of a painful contraction Theo and Miriam
supporting her on either side Kee looks at Miriam

KEE

EXT ALLEY -- NIGHT

The rickshaw parks in front of a building trash piled around
the street Marichka gets off leading them into a doorway
The sounds of dogs howling and arguing in the night

INT STAIRWAY - BUILDING -- NIGHT
The dog hopping up the stairs Marichka next holding a

butane lantern leading them up the dark stairwell Kee
stops suddenly holding herself against the wall in pain

The contraction passes Kee nods Theo and Miriam help her
up the stairs

INT BARE APARTMENT -- NIGHT

The door opens The little dog scampers inside uses a chair
as a springboard leaps onto the table and through the
broken window yaps his presence to the dogs barking outside

Theo and Miriam help Kee into the room Marichka sets the
butane lamp on the table The room is naked peeling walls
broken window panes a rough mat on the floor Cold enough
to see your breath

Miriam immediately pulls the mat to the center of the room
Kee doubles up with another contraction --

KEE
Fuck all

Marichka trying to explain something they cannot understand
pointing at 2 BUCKETS of water the dog yapping and yapping

MIRIAM
(to Theo)
Make her go

Miriam plucks a shard of glass from the broken window Theo
goes to Marichka turning her toward the door

THEO
Thank you Marichka we appreciate your
help that’1ll be all

Kee holds herself on the table moaning with the pain
Miriam dips the glass shard into the bucket -- breaking a
thin layer of ice covering the water cleaning the shard

Marichka turns pointing at Kee agitated prattling on
Miriam gives Theo the glass shard

MIRIAM
Hold this Get her out

(escorting Marichka out)
She’s fine she’s fine just ate

joining his master Miriam helps Kee down onto the mat

MIRIAM
Were going to lay down now Slowly

Kee kneels onto the mat with Miriam’s help

Marichka Lighting the candle still talking as she starts
down the stairs with Santo Theo closes the door

MIRIAM

Theo looks at her confused

MIRIAM

Theo takes the flask from his pocket

MIRIAM

Theo pours the alcohol on Miriam’s hands Kee moans in pain
MIRIAM
(reassuring Kee -- and herself)

Miriam dipping her hands into the bucket of water
MIRIAM
(to Theo)
Give me your shirt

Theo pulls off his coat unbuttoning his shirt still
pinching the shard of glass He hands Miriam his shirt

MIRIAM
Sterilize your hands And the glass

( )

Theo takes a quick small drink from his flask Then pours
the rest of the alcohol over his hands and the glass shard

Miriam goes to Kee who is laying on the mat clutching

MIRIAM
You’re nearly there

Kee screaming her extraordinary effort tapping the reservoir
of female strength giving her body over to the new life
coming through it to life itself the miracle --

KEE

-- the baby bursts forth a bloody explosion of life

Miriam pulling it free still hooked by the umbilical cord
the placenta spilling out in a final bloody exclamation -

There is a moment a pause Theo holding Kee Both of them
looking to Miriam

For the first time in eighteen years four months two days
sixteen hours and eight minutes a human child has been born
Miriam holds the newborn baby all blue covered in white
specks giving off steam in the cold room

The first morning sun finding its way into the naked room
Kee still sleeping on the mat the baby at her chest Miriam
seated next to Kee asleep

YAP YAP The tiny barking sound is now outside the door
Footsteps following Theo creakily gets to his feet

There’s a PUSH on the door -- but a chair is wedged against

the door the YAPPING growing frantic

Kee and Miriam open their eyes awakening

around Theo’s throat squeezing Theo gasping reaching Syd
strangling him

From the corridor Kee urges Marichka back to help

Syd keeps tightening his grip around Theo’s neck Theo’s
body going slack

Marichka gets closer still pleading

Theo’s hand reaches to the gun on the floor grabbing the
barrel round-housing it -- SMACK -- into Syd’s face Syd
falls backwards stunned

Theo pushes himself to his feet gasping air back into this
lungs Syd recovering moving toward Theo Theo kicks Syd
in the head Syd falls backwards knocked out Theo for
good measure kicks Syd in the gut

Theo grabs Marichka gasping motioning for them to leave
They head down the corridor joining Kee

They reach a door at the end It’s blocked with boxes and
junk Theo and Marichka clearing the debris Theo forcing
the door open just enough space to pass Behind them
LOBBY

Syd groggily crawls to his knees looking for the gun

END OF CORRIDOR

Marichka snakes through the narrow door passage out to a
small alley Santo following It’s Kee’s turn but there’s
not enough space for her to pass with the baby

From the alley Marichka extends her hands

MARICHKA
Baby Marichka

Kee hesitates Theo pulling the door open Behind them
THROUGH THE CORRIDOR

Syd finds the gun

They start making their way slowly down the alley Marichka
holding Kee up Theo is about to follow when he hears

SYD (OFF)
(into radio)
Jerry they got loose go to the back
the alley

Theo realizes Syd is too close They aren’t going to make
it He looks around rooting through the trash desperate
Worthless plastic rotting food a rusted CLOTHES IRON

JERRY (OFF)
(into radio)
I don’t know Syd this is getting bad
I got a 1-24 a gang of frogs in the

Syd’s face appears at the door They look at each other for
an instant Syd furiously forcing his way through --

Theo grabs the clothes iron and swings --
CRANK Into Syd’s face Syd falls back inside the door

Theo stands staring at the door the iron poised ready
But he quickly understands there’s no need to wait

Theo drops the iron and rushes after the women

AT THE END OF THE ALLEY -

Kee leaning against the wall gathering her strength
Marichka peering around the edge of the building

Theo arrives completely winded “La Marseilles” can be
heard chanted by an approaching mob

THEO
You okay

KEE
It hurts I’m hungry

THEO
(to Marichka re Kee)
She needs to eat

Marichka prattles some sort of answer Theo puts his fingers
to his mouth the universal sign of hunger

THEO
Food mange
(points to Kee)
Hungry

Marichka nods getting it pointing Theo and Marichka take
on either side of Kee helping her walk Santo following
They round the corner onto the street Pocked and rubbled
the streets of Bexhill bear scars of previous violence

A mob marches toward them more than 50 a large flag
billows blue white and red

VOICES
Alons enfants de la patrie

Theo and Kee and Marichka passing the mob in the opposite
direction Passionate chanting some wearing masks all
carry guns -- modern semi-automatics a few old Glocks

EXT FORMER BANK -- DAY

This street seems quiet “La Marseilles” now distant
Marichka gestures leading them into a bureaucratic building
covered with graffiti Further down the street on building
tops men with rifles run from roof to roof

INT FORMER BANK -- CONTINUOUS

Theo Kee and the baby Marichka and Santo enter Dozens of

old shoes on the floor neatly paired They hear CHANTING --
rhythmic prayers

( )

It was once a bank but now just the skeleton remains a few
teller counters some bars along the lobby Through them

Men kneel on a carpeted floor bowing toward Mecca in humble
prayer This is a makeshift mosque

They pass by moving to the stairs at the end of the hall
2ND FLOOR CORRIDOR

At the end of the dark corridor Marichka is bent down at a
metal door talking to someone through a low eye-slit A
tiny flashlight shines through the slit into her face A
trembly voice on the other side of the door in Russian

GEORGIAN MAN (OFF)
Nyet

At the stairs foggy light oozes though the filthy windows
Kee rests on Theo discerning Marichka across the dark
corridor now waving for them to come insisting prattling
Theo helps Kee into the dark corridor

GEORGIAN MAN (OFF)
Nyet nyet

As they approach the secure metal door the flashlight from
the eye slit shines in Theo’s face

Marichka grabs Kee’s cloak The light shifts to Kee’s face
as she resists but the cloak opens The light tilts down
shining on the baby eyes closed feeding on Kee’s breast

From the eye-slit the flashlight shaking a gasp
INT GEORGIAN COUPLE’S APARTMENT -- DAY

A pale withered GEORGIAN WOMAN hums a folk song as she
carves the final touches onto an orange that she’s cut into a
swan She presents the swan to Kee who lays in bed eating
some sort of potato stew the baby asleep at her side

KEE
Watch at that

They’re in a simple dwelling that was once a bureaucrat’s
office One table two chairs a gas burner photos a
Chagal reproduction of the cow on the farm And in the
clean big windows a few potted plants green living

KEE
Check it out Theo They love my baby

(

Theo sits at the table eating stew Marichka stands nearby
wolfing hers -- she hasn’t eaten this good in awhile The
ancient dignified GEORGIAN MAN (90’s) sits in a wheelchair
speaking in a trembly voice with thick accent

GEORGIAN MAN
Human Project is real

KEE
Yeh Wise man doctors from todo the
world Living in Iceland Sent a boat
to my baby “The Tomorrow” At the buoy

THEO
We need a boat to meet it Before
sunset

The Georgian Man asks Marichka a question in her language
Marichka answers by rubbing her thumb to her fingers the
universal sign for money

MARICHKA
(mouthful of stew)
“Bunch of money”

GEORGIAN MAN
(in Marichka’s language)
“Yeah yeah yeah”

The Georgian Man wheels himself toward the bookshelf
Marichka looks at Theo rubbing her thumb to her fingers

MARICHKA
“Bunch of money”

The Georgian Man arrives at the bookshelf where pantheon of
busts reside Lenin Freud Einstein Ghandi Trotsky
Zapata and Martin Luther King Jr He selects Lenin

GEORGIAN MAN
(to Theo)
Always money Everything always money

Seeing the owners distracted Marichka nabs a silver spoon
from the table and sneaks it into her shirt An amplified
voice echoes from the street

VOICE (OFF)
A curfew is now in effect

Theo looks

THROUGH THE WINDOW

A caravan of armored personal carriers and tanks move slowly
down the empty streets

VOICE
(over loudspeaker)
Anyone seen on the streets will be
considered hostile and shot England
supports you and provides you shelter
Do not support terrorists

Then the same message translated into French On top of the
building across the street men in masks armed with rifles
run in the opposite direction of the tanks

KEE’S VOICE
Watch at that Watch at Santo and the
pussy

IN THE APARTMENT
RUFF Santo barks HISS The cat arches Kee laughs

KEE
Get it on

The Georgian Man rolls back in his wheelchair to the table
holding the bust of Lenin

GEORGIAN MAN
We hear Human Project no believe
Trick make people hope
(smiles )
But is real

The remains of the smile on the old man’s lips as he looks to
his wife telling her something in Russian Then

GEORGIAN MAN
Human Project

GEORGIAN WOMAN
(smiles )
Human Project
Marichka nods laughs pretending like she understands

MARICHKA
Human Project

The Georgian Man BREAKS Lenin’s bust on the table In the
porcelain shards a roll of money English pounds

EXT FORMER BANK -- DAY

Marichka stands in the middle of the street her senses
alert Sporadic gunfire and shouting in the distance but
the street seems safe She signals and starts trotting

Theo immediately pushes Kee from the bank in the Georgian
Man’s wheelchair Kee has the baby wrapped against her chest
and covered She’s holding the orange cut like a swan

EXT BAY STREET -- DAY

The group in the middle of a street obscured in fog Theo
pushing Kee in the wheelchair trying to keep up with
Marichka’s quick trot Santo tapping along

A RUMBLING in the street Santo stops turns around and
starts barking

The ground begins to shake They all turn the street behind
them shrouded in fog Street poles shaking A mechanical
clacking adds to the rumbling drowning out Santo’s barks
Through the foga silhouette slowly taking formmammoth

THEO
Shit

The silhouette defines itself as the fog gives way

right on them

backing off

Marichka grabs the dog She turns finding her stride
running back towards the others trying to catch up

DOWN BAY STREET
Theo and Kee come against a long metal pole wedged in a

sewer fortified by a big mountain of broken concrete and
debris blocking the street -- a barricade

Theo turns the wheelchair veering off towards
A NARROW ALLEY
As soon as Theo and Kee take refuge --
BASQUE MAN
(in Basque)

“Down Down”
They turn a man with a machine gun is yelling at them They
are surrounded by other men -- some masked all of them armed
-- more guns than the previous mobs
Marichka makes it to the alley chastising Santo --

“Get down”

Marichka sizes the situation and immediately drops to the
ground

the building

From a 5th floor window a Fish fires down on the soldiers
Other Fishes shoot from different windows

EXT BURNED OUT DOUBLE-DECKER

Theo steps off the bus A zone of hell -- armored carriers
and soldiers -- separate him from the apartment block
Bullets flying from all directions

shooting the building to pieces and heads to the far edge of
the square in front of the apartment block making it to

A CONCRETE BARRICADE

Theo shields himself behind it Across

APARTMENT BLOCK PLAZA
The facade of the building falling to pieces Tenants

streaming out the front doors hands in the air screaming
surrender in a dozen languages --

TAT-TAT-TAT-TAT Soldier’s gun fire cuts down the fleeing
tenants A few survivors retreat back into the building

The tank targets its big gun at a 4th floor window where
shots are coming

momentary silence of the aftershock

CONCRETE BARRICADE
Theo sucks a breath gathers his courage makes his break
APARTMENT BLOCK PLAZA

Theo in the open running toward the doorway side-stepping
the bodies of dead soldiers and tenants

The soldiers busy with the windows are slow in clocking
Theo running from the periphery But the doorway is still
distant for Theo and some soldiers aim at him firing away

The bullets ricochetting and whizzing past Theo’s head and
his feet still not close to the doorway

3RD STREET
More soldiers notice Theo shooting at him
APARTMENT BLOCK DOORWAY

Bullets kick up debris around Theo The doorway getting
closer he sidesteps the bodies of soldiers and tenants

5 steps separate him from the jagged hole that is the door
He slips on the blood-slicked cement falling hard bullets
ripping fallen bodies all around some getting more shots

He crawls in panic A final desperate lunge across blood
glass and debris Guardian angels working overtime he
crosses the threshold of the door

INT APARTMENT BLOCK LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS

Theo crawling at top speed across the dark corridor
splattered with rubble and dead bodies bullets echoing and
ricochetting around the walls

And now gunfire coming at him from the inside the hook-nosed
leaves his position storming after Theo

Theo shields himself behind pillar the hook-nosed coming at
him shooting

Bullets from the outside ricochet through the corridor
clipping the hook-nosed man in the head He falls dead

Theo gasps for breath The soldiers’ attack on the doorway
slowly diminishes giving way to gunfire from within

Across the corridor he sees a man and a woman huddle behind
a pillar He slowly gets up Cautiously making his way
through bodies and debris to the stairs

At the foot of the stairs Kee’s discarded wheelchair Theo
starts climbing

INT 2ND FLOOR STAIRCASE

Theo arrives at the landing looking down the hallway A few
tenants huddled in the dim shadows staying low keeping away
from the windows A man cries in agony splashing the puddle
of his own blood But the heavy gunfire comes from upstairs
He continues up

INT 3RD FLOOR STAIRCASE

Theo gets to the floor peering down the hallway Tenants on
the floor covering their heads a few wounded screaming
some bullets make it through the apartment crashing into the
hall walls Theo steps into

3RD FLOOR HALLWAY

He walks through the hallway and looks into an apartment
where a gun is being shot

INT 3RD FLOOR APARTMENT

Three tenants lay dead on the floor At the window Patric
fires down at the soldiers below Immediately he retreats
from the window as bullets from outside rip through the
room rushing toward the door

INT 3RD FLOOR HALLWAY
Theo retreats to the stairway landing hiding as --

Patric storms out of the apartment goes down the hall
disappearing into another apartment A moment Fresh gun
shots are heard Patric runs out soldiers bullets ripping
through the apartment He heads farther down the hallway

PATRIC
(pushing past tenants)
Fuck outta my way fuck outta my way

Patric kicks open the door of another apartment

Theo notices the orange cut like a swan a few steps above
him smashed He continues up the stairs

INT 4TH FLOOR HALLWAY

Theo steps into the corridor A tank mortar has ripped open
a gaping hole in the building People huddle in the hallway
the wounded the terrified the dead

Theo walks through the hallway reaching the mortar hole
Soldiers’ bullets scream through the opening shattering the
wall spewing debris He considers crossing before backing
off returning to the stairs

Then he hears it

A BABY’S CRY A weak wail through the chaos and explosions
Coming from the end of the corridor Separated by the gaping
mortar hole where bullets crash through

Theo edges up to the mortar-ripped hole Sporadic bullets
smashing the wall He sucks a breath And runs It’s only
ten feet but it feels like a mile the shots ringing past
He makes it to the other side He continues down the hall
The baby’s cries louder Tenants huddled in the hallway
peering up warily not quiet believing what they are hearing
Loud cries coming from an apartment Theo steps into

INT 4TH FLOOR APARTMENT

The place has been shredded by bullets glass shattered

everything upended Kee in a corner protecting her baby
girl with her body

( )

Luke lays by the window in a pool of his own blood with his
back toward Kee sniping out the window In his other hand
he shouts instructions on a radio

LURE
»get ready to blow the south gate The
South gate Were coming out

With Luke’s distraction Theo makes it over to Kee The baby
is visible on her chest still crying

THEO
You okay

KEE
Yeh

THEO

How is she

KEE
Pissed off

Theo leans down to Kee helping her up
THEO
(to Kee)
Easy We’re going to make it

Bullets from outside RIDDLE the wall near them Theo covers
Kee with his body The shooting passes

At the window Luke responds shooting rounds outside

Theo and Kee making their way across the ruined room to the
door Theo steps on glass a cracking sound --

Luke turns and sees them He points the gun Theo freezes
LUKE
I carried her out of the wheelchair and
I started crying The baby A girl

THEO
Yeah it’s a girl

LUKE
I forgot what they looked like

THEO
We need to get her out of here

LUKE
No no no You don’t understand Faron
It‘s happening I did what Julian
couldn’t I called for the national
uprising And the people have responded
Not only here All over England I made
it happen They follow me

Theo slowly keeps leading Kee to the doorway wary of Luke
who sites him with his pistol

LURE
Stop Faron This child stays with us
It’s our flag

KEE
Fuck she is

Theo and Kee at the doorway

LUKE
This child is our new beginning

THEO
That she is

BAM Luke shoots Theo recoils hit in the gut knocked
back out the door

TAT-TAT-TAT Glass shatters as guns fire from the outside
ripping Luke to pieces

INT 4TH FLOOR HALLWAY

Theo clears the doorway He’s in momentary shock against
the wall clutching his gut looking at the blood oozing
through his fingers

THEO
Shit

KEE
Fucker shot you

THEO
I’m okay Bullet went through
(gritting through pain)
We gotta move

Theo breathing through the pain holing up Kee walking down
the hall the baby still crying

The bullets intensifying from the outside tearing through
the disintegrating facade smashing into the hall walls --
all that noise numbed by the baby’s cries

People huddled in the corridor looking in disbelief A
woman falls to her knees

WOMAN
(praying)
Dios te salve Maria llena eres de
gracia el senor es contigo bendita
eres entre las mujeres

They get closer to the stairwell Bullets are still flying
but people seem fearless poking their heads from doors
risking their safe spots to get a closer look

The baby’s crying gives an aura of security to Theo and Kee
They are no longer ducking walking straight down the hall

A man breaks into tears An old woman bleeding to death on
the floor reaches her gnarled finger to touch the baby’s
garment She smiles as they pass -- she has heard the song
of an angel

Theo and Kee arrive at the stairs Kee starts to walk down
but Theo stops her

THEO
Come on

KEE
You’re shot

THEO
I can do it

Kee allows Theo to pick her up He grunts with the effort
and begins carrying them down

INT 4TH FLOOR STAIRWELL

The baby’s cry expands through the contained space Theo
carrying Kee down using the wall for support People
huddled on the stairs looking with amazement People
peering down at them from the upper floors

TAT-TAT-TAT A gun battle coming up the stairs toward them

Patric and 2 Fishes are backing up the stairs shooting down
at pursuing soldiers below who answer with a round of fire

Patric hears crying turning pointing his gun at

( )

Theo and Kee no place to hide Patric pointing the gun at
Theos head about to puil the trigger But the baby is
wailing in Kee’s arms Patric looking at the baby in stunned
disbelief Then he lowers his gun He and the Fishes back
away Staring at the baby as Theo and Kee head down

INT 3RD FLOOR STAIRWELL

Gunfire from below forces people against the wall ‘Theo and
Kee continue walking down Heavy footsteps A soldier
surges up the stairs pointing his gun at the newborn girl
who wails away

Theo and Kee walk past him The soldier breathless the cry
conflicting with his adrenaline

SOLDIER
Hold positions and hold fire

Theo continues carrying Kee down People on the stairs
standing up getting a look More soldiers holding their
weapons in silence stilled by the baby’s cry

INT APARTMENT BLOCK LOBBY

The baby cries echo through the lobby now held by the
military Soldiers hold strategic positions watching Theo
and Kee pass glimpsing the child in confusion awe

At the shattered doorway Theo staggers Kee sees his sweat
his pain His shirt is covered in blood

KEE
Put me down

Theo hesitates

KEE
I wanna walk

Theo sets Kee down on her feet Kee walks slowly
resolutely leaning on Theo for support They pass through
the shattered doorway

EXT APARTMENT BLOCK PLAZA

Theo Kee and the baby step into the murky light of the foggy
day An impenetrable line of soldiers positioned in the
plaza face them their weapons pointed ready The heavy
machinery of war silenced by the cries of a baby

Theo and Kee walk forward toward the soldiers

The weapons aimed at them begin to lower An instinctive
shuffle to the side as if commanded by the cry creating a
space for them to pass

Kee carrying her child Theo limping at her side bleeding
as the ocean of soldiers part like the Red Sea allowing them
to pass through The somber faces of the soldiers watching
touched by the baby’s crying

BAM BAM BAM Rifle shots from the 4th floor window shatter
the silence Two soldiers behind Theo are hit

Theo covers Kee as soldiers open fire at the apartment block
From the windows guns fire back

A new battle flares Theo and Kee walk ignored by the
soldiers that surge forward taking new positions

KA-BOOM The tank blasts a massive hole in the 4th floor
CORNER - WHARF and 3RD

Leaving the battle behind Kee and Theo walking down the
street Theo limping badly Marichka surges from the corner
holding Santo greeting them with a bad-toothed smile The
Sewer Rat by her side

EXT WHARF STREET SEWER -- A LITTLE LATER

The Sewer Rat pulling off a sewer lid Theo grunting as he
helps get it off the rest of the way Theo kneeling there
gasping his face drained The baby still crying

INT SEWER

A ceiling lamp illuminates a concrete sewer drain a narrow
channel of foul water running through it Boxes of contraband
stacked to one side alcohol batteries medicine cans of
food electrical wire Marichka giving some bills to the
Sewer Rat

Theo sitting in a BOAT a simple wooden launch with two
paddles moored with a rope to the side He’s in bad shape
He helps Kee accommodate herself in back She’s holding a
candle

Marichka comes to them prattling on Santo on her shoulders
gesturing toward the end of the tunnel where ambient light
filters in

MARICHKA
Go go boat

Theo extends his hand to help Marichka into the Launch

MARICHKA
Marichka no go

Marichka counts off a few bills for herself handing the rest
of the wad to Theo

THEO

Marichka smiles She pushes the launch into motion
Theo starts to row Kee holding the candle she puts the
baby on her breast The baby quiets feeding Glimpses of
graffiti on the walls like cave paintings
Marichka receding in darkness holding Santo waving at them
AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL
A breeze from outside extinguishes the candle Theo rows
toward the light Passing through a metal grate that has
been cut away
EXT SEWER -- DAY
The launch emerges into the fog distant sounds of the riot
filtering through A barbed-wire fence running the length
shoreline separates them from Bexhill

They ride the drainage channel that feeds a short distance
into the sea

EXT THE SEA’S EDGE -- CONTINUOUS

The launch coming out of the channel meeting the sea Theo
rowing in pain The fog obscuring the riot in the city
Dead calm but the tide is on their side

EXT OPEN SEA -- DAY

What lays beyond obscured by milky fog

Theo rowing slowing slightly strength waning The fog has
enveloped the city behind them the riots a distant echo
The world around them has disappeared

Ahead of them the fog gives way opening into sunlight
Revealing the rhythmic flashing of a BUOY

KEE
The buoy Theo the buoy

Theo rows once more groaning with the effort

KEE
What time is it

The launch gains momentum then slows The sun now visible
touching the horizon the day ending

THEO
Late

KEE
They’11l wait

Kee is alert looking around the buoy rocking rhythmically
splashing water Theo stops rowing tears in his eyes

THEO
I am sorry Kee I am so sorry

KEE
We gonna make it

Theo shakes his head eyes wet He knows

THEO
I’m not gonna make it

Kee looks at him

THEO
And Ill never know if you make it

Theo smiles at her

THEO
But I want to believe that you will
KEE
I will
THEO
Promise
KEE

Fuckin’ yeah

THEO
Cheedo

Theo’s coat opens revealing a nasty gut wound —

THEO
You remember those spring days in London
when the sun shines It was one of those
days People taking their shirts off
Some had flowers in their hair Music
was playing It was like a big
celebration And suddenly people were
running in all directions People
falling stepping on each other panic
Julian got carried away swallowed in the
crowd And it came so hard The rubber
bullet Knocked me flat on my back
When I got up I saw the blood And he
wasn’t moving I put my arm around him
to protect him You get it I put my
arm around him to protect him after he
was dead

The boat drifting

KEE

THEO

Huh
KEE

Gonna call her Dylan Girl’s name too

yeh

Theo in pain genuinely smiles
THEO
(to baby)
Hi Dylan
Theo musters all he’s got left reaching the oars back wood
cutting through water grunting his last breath propelling
the launch a little farther
And that’s it

Theo’s body slumps as the launch loses momentum And slows
No direction Drifting Kee’s eyes fill with tears

KEE
(a whisper)
Theo

No response a

The water slaps at the edges of the launch The sun spewing
a final burst of color as it disappears behind the horizon
the day ending

Behind the buoy --

A BOAT Cutting through the water towards them

KEE
Theo “The Tomorrow”

But Theo doesn’t move

The wooden vessel approaching nets and gear -- A FISHING
BOAT The name painted on the stern “THE TOMORROW”

FADE OUT
