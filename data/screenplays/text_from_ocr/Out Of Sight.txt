The financial district Lots of people in suits A shaky

spasmodic ZOOM IN finds

JACK FOLEY -- forty big focused expression -- as he rips a
tie from around his neck and throws it down in the gutter He
starts across the street now peeling off his suitcoat and
dropping that too right there on the asphalt as we then

WHIP PAN OVER TO REVEAL A BANK ACROSS THE STREET
As Foley goes inside we then
CUT TO A PRINTED BROCHURE THAT READS
LOOKING FOR MONEY
YOUVE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE

We then PULL BACK TO REVEAL that were now
INSIDE THE BANK

as Foley stands at a counter holding the above CREDIT APPLICATION
while he studies the bank layout

Foley watches a MAN IN A SUIT carrying an attache-case enter
the bank and move through the gate into the fenced-off business
area at the front An EXECUTIVE rises from his desk shakes
hands with the man and they both sit down

Foley rosses the brochure in the trash then crosses to a teller
window where a nameplate on the counter tells us the young woman
with the pile of dark hair smiling at him is LORETTA

TELLERLORETTA
How can I help you sir

FOLEY
Loretta you see that guy talking to
your manager has his case open

Foley takes out a ZIPPO LIGHTER and casually yet expertly
begins to fiddle with it as the teller looks across the bank

LORETTA
Thats Mr Guindon one of our assistant
managers Our manager is Mr Schoen

but hes not in today

FOLEY
But you see the guy with the attache
case

LORETTA
(looks again)
Yes

FOLEY
Thats my partner He has a gun in
there And if you dont do exactly
what I tell you or you give me any
kind of a problem Ill look over at
my partner and hell shoot your Mr
Guindon between the eyes

Loretta goes stiff swallows stares back at Foley

FOLEY (CONTD)

Now take one of those big envelopes
and put as many hundreds fifties and
twenties as you can pack into it
Nothing with bank straps or rubber
bands I dont want any dye packs I
dont want any bait money Start with
the second drawer and then the one
over there under the computer Come

of the drawer

(as she works)
First time being robbed

(she nods)
Youre doing great Just smile
Loretta so you wont look like youre
being held up

(she smiles awkwardly)
Thats the way youre doing fine

We hear a bit of thunder and Foley cuts a fast look out the
front door When he turns back he sees that Lorettas having
some trouble fitting all the bills into the envelope

FOLEY (CONTD)
Here give me the twenties I1l put
em in my pocket Okay I havent had
to give my partner a sign thats good
Now hes gonna wait thirty seconds
till after Im out the door make sure

and have a nice day

LORETTA

Foley heads for the door He pauses by Mr Guindons desk
looks back at Loretta Foley smiles at her then turns to the

Man sitting with Mr Guindon indicates Loretta

FOLEY
Shes cute isnt she

The man looks across the bank at Loretta

MAN
Uh yeah I guess so

Foley winks at Loretta and walks out
MAN (CONTD)

As Foley comes out he calmly walks to a Honda Civic and gets in

INT CAR - SAME

As Foley tries to start the car No go He tries again
FOLEY

But the car wont start Foley bangs on the wheel

FOLEY (CONTD)

Foley then stiffens as a cop sticks his gun through the open
window into Foleys ear

COP

Foley looks to the passenger window where ANOTER COP smiling
now has his gun pointing at him

SECOND COP
Get outve the car sir

FOLEY
Wanna hear a funny story

SECOND COP
Shut up and get outve the car

And as Foley obliges we then
FADE TO WHITE

We hear a MAN GRUNT Then see Foley in SLOW MOTION as he jumps
through frame now we see a basketball come up in his hand as
we realize hes on his way to the rim when

- ANOTHER GUY rams into him in mid-air knocks him down
EXT PRISON YARD - DAY

A BASKETBALL GAME in progress All of the men Foley included
are dressed in blue coveralls and white T-shirts The game is
rough Hair is pulled Eyes are poked Faces punched

A title reads GLADES CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION BELLE GLADE
FLORIDA

Foley is the oldest player here Hes getting tired starts to
lose his breath He finally walks off the court breathing so
hard he cant even talk He simply motions to SOME YOUNG CONVICT
to come in and take his place

Foley sits down on a bench tries to catch his breath He looks
across the yard to where

A GROUP OF ELDERLY INMATES

sitting around a wooden picnic table are playing cards All of
them are over sixty One of them a one-legged guy on crutches
hops away from the table spits out some tobacco as we
INTERCUT THE OLD TIMERS WITH FOLEY WATCHING THEM

As we see one old guy is making a picture frame out of old Pal
Mal and Lucky Strike packs Another tends to a tomato bush in
a tiny patch of garden near the wall Another one sits nearby
painting a picture of a man and a boy fishing from a rowboat

Foley is about to get up off the bench when something catches
his eye He watches as

TWO LATINO MEN

both little guys jog past the game slow to a walk then stop
and begin stretching out One of them nods to Foley Foley
nods back waits for the Latin guys to walk off then walks
over to a guard PUPKO (PUP) heavy-set dumb as dirt

PUP

Foley keeps his eyes fixed on the basketball game

FOLEY

INT MESS HALL - LUNCH
As Foley takes his tray up the centre aisle he scans the sea
of white T-shirts until he sees the two little Latins sitting
at a table full of other little Latins CHINO -- fifties in
shape -- shovels macaroni in his mouth

Chinos wife LULU nineteen looks up from his own neat tray
of macaroni and jello and watches Foley walk past and sit down
with a bunch of bikers

Foley watches as the guy across from Chino scrapes some macaroni
off his plate and on to Chinos and Chino wolfs that down too

EXT MESS - DAY

Chino steps outside and lights a cigarette He puts an arm
around Lulu starts to walk off

FOLEY (OS)

Chino looks over watches Foley approach lets his arm slip
down so he can hook his thumb into Lulus belt the next
thing to having him on a leash

FOLEY

INT FOLEYS CELL - BELLE GLADE - DAY

Foley comes in ies down on the bunk He looks about the

cell All hes got to show for himself Its now quiet on

the cellblock Foley closes his eyes and we

CUT TO EXT PRISON AUDITORIUM

A few hundred cons scream encouragementinsults as MAURICE
SNOOPY MILLER a lanky scary mean-looking black man in boxing

trunks hits a white guy with a ferocious hook

Title reads LOMPOC FEDERAL PENITENTIARY LOMPOC CALIFORNIA
And then TWO YEARS AGO

AT THE BACK OF THE AUDITORIUM

Foley leans in a doorway watching with BUDDY BRAGG -- black
Foleys age shaved head

The BELL SOUNDS and the white guy staggers to his corner as
does Maurice GLENN MICHAELS -- surfer look dark shades --
counts cash in Maurices corner whispers something into the
fighters ear

BUDDY
Ref dont call it pretty soon Snoopys
gonna send this guy out in a body bag

Foley watches a MAN -- fifties out of place not as hard-looking
as those around him The guy looks nervous can feel the other
cons eyes on him as he tries to find a seat

The BELL SOUNDS and the white boxer staggers to his feet
Maurice steps in and resumes the bloody pummelling Foley turns
and watches the fight now

FOLEY
Anyone ever tell you why they call him
Snoopy

Buddy shakes his head Maurice dances around the other guy
now Teases him

FOLEY (CONTD)
He was Maurice Mad Dog Miller back
when he was pro Now you pet him he
goes down

The white guy throws a tired loping roundhouse that barely
glances off Maurices jaw Sure enough Maurice makes a big

show out of snapping his head back staggering before he finally
goes down

BUDDY
I dont believe it

Foley watches the new inmate as fights erupt all around him
and anxious now he tries to get out of there

EXT PRISON YARD - DAY

Foley and Buddy sit atop a cement picnic table watching as
nearby the winning BOXER -- still wearing last nights
pummelling on his face -- gloats to a group of cons He throws
a fake punch at one of them as he demonstrates his winning
technique

BUDDY
Guys braggin he won a thrown fight
Fuckin pathetic

Foley looks at the other side of the yard where Maurice now
stands at the far side of the yard coldly watching the guy one
hand thrust into his pocket Foley watches as Maurice stops
the NEW INMATE -- the older guy who looked out of place at the
fights -- as he comes out into the yard

FOLEY
Its Richard Ripley

BUDDY
(looking now)
The Wall Street guy Oh yeah I
didnt recognize him without his rug

Foley watches as Maurice talks to the new inmate the guy
nodding acquiescent respectful

FOLEY
Dick the Ripper they called him on
account of all the people he ripped
off

Foley watches as Ripley now makes a note in a BLACK BOOK

BUDDY
Whats he doin here

GLENN (OS)
Three years

They look to where Glenn Michaels the blond guy in dark shades
we saw in Maurices corner works out on the bench press a few
feet away Hes shirtless tan in shape

GLENN
He got three years and fined fifty
million dollars and wrote em a fucking
check Like that fifty mil signed
his name
(struggles with the
bar)
Whoa-- little help here

FOLEY

Who you talkin to Studs Me or
Buddy I cant tell you got those
shades on

GLENN
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy

FOLEY
I guess the bright glare out here made
it hard to see the numbers on the
weights

GLENN
Ill take the shades off Just get
this fuckin thing off me
Foley helps him get the bar up Glenn sits up

BUDDY
How do you know he wrote a check

GLENN
He told me He works the laundry with
me The guy loves to talk

FOLEY
Yeah to the US Attorney I hear he
rolled over on all the snitches he was
doing business with and got em all
brought up

He watches Snoopy talking to Ripley one eye always on the
swaggering boxer across the yard one hand in his pocket

GLENN
Hey anybody that can write a check
for fifty mil he says anything Im
all fucking ears Like the other day
he tells me how hes got all this money
in foreign banks plus around five mil
in uncut diamonds at his house He
said quote Where I can put my hands
on it anytime

BUDDY
Cool Wheres the guy live

Foley watches a few more of Maurices friends surround Ripley
Again Ripley takes out his black book starts nodding making
notations

GLENN
Detroit Snoopy Miller told me uncut
diamonds are as easy to move as cash

FOLEY
Ever seen an uncut diamond Studs
They look like plain old rocks

GLENN
So Whats your point

FOLEY
My point is thats probably what youre
gonna end up with

GLENN
You think hes lying

FOLEY
Use your head The guys got five
million lying around his house you
really think hes gonna tell some
motormouth he just met in prison about
it

A BELL SOUNDS Everyone starts walking for the gate

Foley watches as the Boxer and his crew head for the gate
Maurice still standing there with his hand in his pocket

SLOW MOTION AS the boxer gets to the gate sees Maurice who
moves to him now smiling like hes so glad to see him his
left hand clapping the guy on the back saying something like
congratulations as now his right hand comes out of his pocket
and we see the long metal shiv--

BUDDY
(watching Snoopy)
Here it comes

Maurice wraps his left arm around the boxers shoulder and hugs
him tight for a moment then quickly moves away The Boxer
stands there like a statue doesnt move until hes at last
jostled from behind and his legs fold and he drops to the cement

BUDDY (CONTD)
I guess the Snoop doesnt like to lose
even if its on purpose

We hear a WHISTLE BLOW as a GUARD spots the body And now
everyone moves like hell for the gate except for

Richard Ripley who stands there frozen staring down at the
body

Foley glances back at the approaching guards casually takes
Ripley by the arm as he passes leads him away from there talks
to him as they walk into the block

FOLEY
You dont wanna be standing there the
hacks start asking questions you dont

wanna answer

RIPLEY
Oh uh right thanks

Foley then moves away He sees Maurice looking back at him
giving him a hard stare just before he melts into the crowd

DISSOLVE TO
INT FOLEYS CELL - BELLE GLADE - DAY (NOW)
He lies there another moment when
A PAIROF LEGS swings down over the side from the top bunk

Foleys CELLMATE jumps down walks the three feet or so to the
toilet casually pulls down his pants and starts to go to the
bathroom Foley shakes his head and turns away
EXT STRIP MALL - DAY

As Buddy walks up to a Cadillac Sedan DeVille Concours pulling
a slim-jim from the back of his pants about to jimmy the door
when he sees

A WOMAN -- middle-aged wearing pearls and high heels -- come
out of the Winn Dixie pushing a grocery cart full of groceries

Buddy sticks the jimmy back in his pants waits until the woman
is opening her trunk before coming forward

BUDDY
Here lemme help you with those maam

She doesnt seem too sure about it but lets him load the
groceries in the trunk and take the key out of the lock

WOMAN
I didnt ask for your help so dont
expect a tip

Buddy smiles waves her off
BUDDY

Thats okay matam Ill just take
your car

She stands there stupidly as he gets in and drives off
INT CHAPEL - DUSK

In the midst of a remodel As door opens and Pup comes in
Foley puts a finger to his lips

FOLEY
Theyre right underneath you Pup
They dug a tunnel

Foley watches Pup creep up the aisle towards the front of the
chapel eyes on the floor listening

PUP
I dont hear em Wheres the tunnel
come out

Pup turns his back walks up the aisle and across the front of
the pews to a window

FOLEY
Second fence post from the tower out

there Go on take a look

As Pup stares out the window
PUP
I dont see nothing there

Foley reaches down into a pew wheres stashed a FOUR-FOOT
CRUCIFIX He picks it up starts up the aisle

FOLEY
You will directly Keep watching

INT KAREN SISCOS CAR - DUSK

As the high beams from her car show the prison parking area
then the fence strung with razor wire Karen parks near the
fence lights a cigarette and dials her car phone

KAREN
Hi Karen Sisco again for Ray Nicolet
(beat)
Hes not Could you tell him that
never mind Ill call back

Headlights hit Karens rear-view mirror a car pulling in behind
her The lights go off then come on again She adjusts the
mirror to deflect the glare

INT THE CAR BEHIND HER - DUSK

As Buddy sits watching the cons come in from the athletic field
He sees the mirror flash in the car in front of him as Karen
checks her face out in the rear-view

INT CHAPEL - DUSK

As Foley moves up behind Pup he lets his jacket fall to the floor
holds the crucifix down against his leg

PUP
There some car headlights out there
(then)
Jesus Christ

Now he pulls his radio from his belt says into it

PUP (CONTD)
Man outside the fence By tower six
(responds to radio)
This is Officer Pupko
(then)
Im looking at him for Christs sake

Okay-- now Foley raises the metal cross steps in and lays it
smack against the side of Pups head Drops him clean with one
swing bouncing him off the window frame and down without a
sound coming from him

INT KAREN SISCOS CAR - NIGHT
As Karen grabs the court papers off the seat opens her car
door glances at the fence and pauses as she sees A FIGURE there
crouching down

Karen turns on her headlights No not crouched The guy is
coming out of the ground On this side of the fence

Head and shoulders appear and another guy comes out of the
ground Right in front of her

Karen leans on the horn holds it down and sees the two guys by
the fence -- Chino and Lulu -- look into her headlights poised
there for a moment before taking off into the dark Karen gets
out of the car

INT BUDDYS CAR - SAME

As Buddy watches a spotlight from the tower come on and follow
the two cons as we then hear the sound of RIFLE REPORTS before
the men disappear into the dark

Then Buddy sees Karen in his headlights whistles softly as he
gets a good look at her long legs as she raises the lid to her
trunk

BUDDY
Whats she doing

He watches her duck her head in the trunk and come out with a
holstered pistol

BUDDY (CONTD)
Uh-oh

But then she throws the pistol in the trunk ducks in there
again and comes out this time racking a shotgun

BUDDY (CONTD)
Uh-oh

And now Buddy watches her hurry to the front of her car and
raise the shotgun as we hear A WHISTLE BLOW IN THE COMPOUND
Buddy gets out of the car

EXT PARKING AREA - SAME

As Karen puts the shotgun on two more cons both filthy dirty
standing by the hole they just crawled out of

KAREN
Get your hands in the air

Buddy watches the two cons both Latins make up their minds
start edging away -- shit theyve come this far

They look out at the spotlight sweeping around in the dark
then look the other way along the fence towards the main gate
to see armed hacks coming out on the run and that decides it
for the cons They take off running

Now Buddy watches as Karen puts her pump gun on them but doesnt
fire

The hacks running from the gate with rifles beat her to it
open up all at once and keep firing until the two convicts are
cut down as they run

The hacks glance at Karen but dont bother with her more
interested in the hole the convicts had come out of Now theyre
standing by it peering in edging closer with their weapons
ready then they all step back at once bump into each other
as

A head appears wearing a guards baseball cap the guy now saying
something to the guards his face smeared with muck excited
pointing towards the orange grove

They run off pausing briefly to kick the convicts they shot to
see if theyre alive then keep going

The man in the hole Foley climbs out He takes his time
puts on a show standing with his hands on his hips like an
honest-to-God hack that serious cap down on his eyes

Buddy waves to Foley to come on and Karen turns and puts the
shotgun on Buddy Buddy raises the palm of his hand

BUDDY
Its okay honey were good guys

KAREN
Whatre you doing here

Not so much asking but putting it to him the way cops do when
theyre already pretty sure what youre doing She glances
around to include Foley now coming at her like some creature
out of the swamp giving Buddy time to take her around the neck

She fights him jabs him in the gut with the butt end of the
shotgun before Foley wrenches it from her grip

They drag her to the rear end of her car the trunk lid still

up and crouch there as some hacks come running along the fence
past the dark gun tower and cross the road towards the orange
grove A moment later they hear bursts of gunfire then silence

FOLEY
I bet thats all the hacks they send
out Otherwise nobodys left to mind
the store

BUDDY
Why dont we talk about it later
He turns to see Foley and Karen staring at each other in the
headlights from Buddys car Karen not at all afraid

FOLEY
Why youre just a girl What do you
do for a living you pack a shotgun

KAREN
Im a federal marshal and youre under
arrest both of you guys

Foley keeps staring at her like hes giving the situation serious
thought but what he says is

FOLEY
I bet I smell dont I
(then)
Listen you hop in the trunk and well
get out of here

Karen looks at him then gets up climbs into the trunk Shes
reaching around trying to find her pistol when

Foley gives her a shove and gets in with her wedging her against
the wall of the trunk pressing against her back like theyre
cuddled up in bed

He holds her to him giving her no room to turn and stick the
gun in his face Buddy reaches for the trunk lid and then
everything goes

BLACK

Total darkness not a crack or a pinpoint of light showing
Then we hear the engine come to life the car moving along

FOLEY (VO)

KAREN (VO)

FOLEY (VO)

A BEAM OF LIGHT appears as he finds a flashlight and turns it
on He plays the beam along Karens leg calms down some as he
looks at all of her now and finally says

FOLEY (VO)

KAREN
In my bag in the car

They go over some bumps We hear mens voices from somewhere
far off outside

KAREN (CONTD)

He runs his hand down her thigh looking for her gun but also
just well looking

FOLEY
Theyre off in the cane by now chasing
Cubans I timed it to slip between
the cracks you might say

KAREN
You know this isnt gonna end well

these things never do

FOLEY
Yeah well if it turns out I get shot
like a dog itll be in the street
not off a goddamn fence

KAREN
You must see yourself as some kind of
Clyde Barrow

And for a few moments all we hear is the sound of the car on
the road Then

FOLEY
Oh you mean of Bonnie and Clyde Hm
You ever see pictures of him the way
he wore his hat You could tell he
had that dont-give-a-shit air about
him

KAREN
I dont recall his hat but Ive seen
pictures of him lying dead shot by
Texas Rangers Did you know he didnt
have his shoes on

FOLEY
Is that right

KAREN
They put a hundred and eighty-seven
bullet holes in Clyde Bonnie Parker
and the car they were driving Bonnie
was eating a sandwich

FOLEY
Youre full of interesting facts arent

KAREN
It was May 1934 near Gibsland
Louisiana
EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Quiet Empty A moment later the car flies past

FOLEY
And the guy saying he wasnt gonna

KAREN
Peter Finch

FOLEY

have to

KAREN
Bleeding on a country road

FOLEY
It wasnt pretty after no but if you
were in that car -- eating a sandwich --

you wouldnt have known what hit you
We HEAR FAINT SIRENS OS
INT CAR - SAME TIME

As Buddy sees FLASHING LIGHTS approach from the opposite
direction He stays cool as the green and whites get closer
closer then fly right on past

INT TRUNK - SAME
As the SIRENS SCREAM AT US FOR A MOMENT then FADE

FOLEY
Youre sure easy to talk to I wonder --
say we met under different circumstances
and got to talking say you were ina
bar and I came up to you -- I wonder
what would happen

KAREN
Nothing

FOLEY
I mean if you didnt know who I was

KAREN

Silence Foley tries to get back to where it was working

FOLEY
Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked
Three Days of the Condor

KAREN
With Robert Redford when he was young

FOLEY
Yeah

They lie there a moment think about that as we hear THE CAR
SLOWING DOWN coasting then bumping along the shoulder of the
road to a stop

KAREN
I never thought it made sense though
the way they got together so quick

FOLEY
Really

KAREN
I mean romantically

FOLEY
Uh-huh
(then)
Well but if --

The trunk goes dark again as the cars turned off

BUDDY (OS)
You still alive in there

And the trunk lid raises so that we see Karen and Foley lying
in the back Foley gets out Karen doesnt move

FOLEY (OS)
Where in the hell are we

BUDDY
Thats the turnpike up there Glenns
waiting with the other car

FOLEY
Okay honey come on out of there

Karen pushes off rolls from her right side to her left brings
up her Sig Sauer in both hands to put it on them both standing
in the opening in the dark but right there
KAREN
Get your hands up and turn around
Now

FOLEY
Shit

Foley brings the lid down he and Buddy moving in opposite
directions as she begins firing from the inside

As Buddy and Foley hook up again in front of the car We can
see theyre beneath an overpass Foley stares at the trunk

BUDDY
We may as well leave her were leaving
the car and we gotta leave her some place
anyway whats the difference where

FOLEY
Shes coming with us

Foley walks to the passenger seat reaches in the window

BUDDY
Jesus Christ what were you doing in

FOLEY

Get the shotgun And her purse Id
like to know who she is

Foley takes her wallet looks at her drivers licence photo

BUDDY
I already looked Her name is Karen
Sisco Like the Cisco Kid only spelled
different S-i-s-c-o

A sheriffs green-and-white goes screaming past and they keep
to the narrow space between the car and the concrete abutment
of the overpass When the road quiets down Foley moves to the
trunk and bangs on it once with his fist

FOLEY
Karen Be a good girl now you hear
Now Im gonna open the--

Foley jumps at the sound of a pistol shot

FOLEY (CONTD)
Youre putting holes in your car

He looks up to see Buddy holding her shotgun staring at him
He settles down then

FOLEY (CONTD)
Were not leaving you Im gonna open
the trunk enough for you to throw the
gun out Okay You shoot -- Buddys

So its up to you

Foley puts his hand out and Buddy still looking at him funny
gives him the keys

VOICE
Hey

Coming from somewhere above them

VOICE (CONTD)
Its me Glenn

Foley steps out into the open Buddy close behind him They
look up to see a figure head and shoulders against the evening
sky leaning on the concrete overpass rail We can see his
long blond hair falling beside his face now half-concealed
behind dark sunglasses

GLENN
Hey Jack good to see you man The
fuckre you guys shooting at

Foley looks at Buddy

FOLEY
Do we need him

BUDDY
The green-and-whites saw us One of
‘em starts thinking whats that car

Foley thinks about it then looks up at the overpass again

FOLEY
Oh hey Studs We thought you were

FOLEY
Oh nuthin’

Foley shakes his head then walks back to the Ford and bangs
on the trunk

FOLEY (CONTD)
You coming out
Foley sticks the key in the lock as Buddy steps up to the trunk
and racks the pump on the shotgun Foley leans close to the
metal

FOLEY (CONTD)
You hear that

He turns the key and raises the lid Karen bunched in there
extends her arm her hand holding the Sig Sauer by the barrel

KAREN
You win Jack

Jack Buddy gives him another funny look
EXT TOP OF OVERPASS - NIGHT

As Glenn removes a note stuck in the side window of a stolen
Audi that reads GONE TO GET GAS

FOLEY
Have your clothes cleaned and send me

Glenn looks over as the three of them reach the top of the grade
move through the scrub Glenn leans against the car flashers
blinking

KAREN

GLENN
Jesus whatd you crawl through a
sewer

FOLEY

Take your sunglasses off

GLENN
I see better with them on

FOLEY

Glenn shrugs takes them off and sticks them in his jeans

FOLEY (CONTD)
Wait in the car

Somebody forgot to bring me clean
clothes

BUDDY

KAREN

He doesnt say anything as Glenn takes off the raincoat folds
it up then throws it at Foleys feet

GLENN
Here you are sir

Foley watches as Glenn gets his sunglasses out puts them back
on and takes Karen by the arm

BUDDY
Whats wrong with you

Karen looks over at Foley then ducks her head and gets in the
backseat

FOLEY

Buddy watches Foley struggle with the buttons on the uniform
all of them caked with muck

BUDDY
Youre pulling at it Here

He lays the shotgun in the grass and comes up takes the guard
shirt in his two hands and rips it open popping buttons and
tearing the shirt

FOLEY
I dont know why but every time he
opens his mouth I want to punch him
out

BUDDY
He aint the problem Jack

Foley looks at him

BUDDY (CONTD)
You wanna pull your head outta your
ass and tell me why were bringing her
with us

INT CAR - SAME

As Karen watches Glenn get into the car sees him as the dome

light comes on for a second or two before he closes the door

He half turns laying his arm along the top of the seats runs
his hand through his hair

GLENN
if he thinks he can talk to me like
this Shit I dont even know what I
need them for

Karen leans forward to have a look sees Foley and Buddy against
the dark foliage

GLENN (CONTD)
I got a big score lined up up north
They wouldnt even know about it it
wasnt for me I could do it right
now myself except its so fucking
cold up there in January--

KAREN
Glenn

His head turns so that we can see his designer shades

KAREN (CONTD)
You dont remember me do you

GLENN
(beat)
It couldnt have been out at Glades

KAREN
No thats not what Im thinking

He raises his hand strokes his hair away from his face

GLENN
But youre sure weve met huh

KAREN
Last fall I drove you from the Palm
Beach county jail to the federal
courthouse twice Youre Glenn
Michaels
(then)

I never forget anyone Ive cuffed and
shackled

He doesnt move or say a word staring at her now like hes
been turned to stone

KAREN (CONTD)
Lets think for a minute Glenn see if

He turns away all the way around to look straight ahead

KAREN (CONTD)
Do we have a gun in the car

GLENN
I remember you now Shit

KAREN
Foleys not going to make it And if
he goes down Glenn you go with him

She touches his shoulder and he jumps

KAREN (CONTD)
Look I can understand if you and Foley
are close

GLENN
Were not Im helping him yeah--

KAREN
Wait Have you helped him Glenn At
this point technically I doubt you
could be charged with aiding a fugitive
So you still have a choice You can
help him and risk going down again
get cuffed and shackled hope to God
you pull a reasonable judge not some
hard-on Or if you want to play it
another way

She pauses He turns and looks at her

GLENN
Like how

EXT OVERPASS - SAME
Foley watches a car pass on the highway

BUDDY

Foley doesnt say anything Just takes a deep breath as we
HEAR THE CAR START and they both look over

BUDDY (CONTD)

He wants to get out of here and I dont

blame him
They start towards the car Then stop and watch as it takes
off tires squealing as the rubber hits pavement Their backs
to us they stand there watching the tailights until theyre
out of sight down the turnpike neither of them saying a word
We hear SQUEAKY FOOTSTEPS OVER

THE PRISON LIBRARY

Where Richard Ripley sits at one of the tables reading a big
coffee-table book called THE WARM WORLD OF TROPICAL FISH

Himey bulldozes forward pulling his massive fist back to clock
Foley in the head when

in one swift motion Foley brings his book up in one hand
like hes throwing a pie and drives the hefty repair manual
into Himeys face snapping the big guys head back sending
his feet flying out from under him so that he hits the floor
back-first with a loud thud

Maurice goes for Foley who picks up the chair just as we hear A

Tillman the one you were seeing it

banks You recall that

KAREN
When I was seeing Carl Tillman I didnt
know he robbed banks

BURDON
Yeah but I had enough reason to believe
he did and I told you So you had to
at least suspect him

KAREN
And what happened to Carl

BURDON
The time came you shot him But you
didnt shoot Foley or the guy with
him Theyre unarmed you had a shotgun
and you let them throw you in the trunk
Okay now you got your Sig in your

ADELE
He did I dont remember Did he say
about me In the trunk

KAREN
(beat lies)
He said he wished the two of you could
start over live a normal life

ADELE
Huh Problem is Jacks idea of a
normal life is robbing banks Its
all hes ever done

KAREN
Did you know that when you married
him

ADELE

He said he was a card player I could
live with that I never knew he robbed
banks till he got busted with that car
that caught fire -- if you can imagine
something like that happening comes
out of the bank and the cars on fire
I did go see him in jail to tell him I
was filing for divorce He said
Okay Jacks so easy going

(then)
He was fun but never what youd call
a real husband

Adele looks out the window Karen waits looks to an end table
where she sees a photograph of Jack and Adele on a boat somewhere
ten years back

ADELE (CONTD)
Ill say one thing for Jack he was
never ugly or mean or drank too much
He was very considerate lights on or
off if you know what I mean
KAREN

bank and saw the whole thing Buddy
says Ill take the thousand but were

shit you come in

They musta robbed fifty banks together

KAREN
Till they got busted

ADELE

That wasnt Jacks fault No that
was on account of Buddy for some
reason decided to call his sister and
confess to a job before theyd done it
instead of after She called the FBI
and they both went down ended up at
Lompoc

(then)

She turns back to the snowstorm She sees his reflection turn
and leave A moment later the next one appears at the table

EXECUTIVE GUY 2
I think I know why youre depressed --
if I may offer an observation

She just looks at him So sure of himself

EXECUTIVE GUY 2 (CONTD)

rep and your customer isnt exactly
nocked out by the idea of a young
lady even one as stunning as you
handling the account Am I close

Hi Im Andy

She says nothing to him

ANDY

He gives her a sympathetic expression

ANDY

She stares at the guy until he turns away She sips her drink
stares once more out at the blizzard After a few moments
another dark suit appears reflected in the window

reflection for a moment then slowly turns looks up at JACK
FOLEY now standing there in his new navy blue suit

KAREN

She smiles with him When she lowers her hand to the table
his hand comes down to cover hers She watches his expression
as she brings her hand out slowly his eyes not leaving hers
and lays her hand on his The tips of her fingers brush his
knuckles lightly back and forth

KAREN (CONTD)

you never saw before -- you could be
passing on the street -- you look at
each other and for a few seconds
theres a kind of recognition Like
you both know something But then the
next moment the persons gone and
its too late to do anything about it
but you remember it because it was
right there and you let it go and you
think What if I had stopped and said
something It might happen only a
few times in your life

KAREN

They look at each other a moment then

FOLEY
Why dont we get out of here

They both get up The ad guys at the table watch as she follows

KAREN

for a while

They look at each other a moment

FOLEY (CONTD)

holding a bottle he says is
nitroglycerin He scores some cash
off a teller hes on his way out when
he drops the bottle It shatters on
the tile floor he slips in the stuff
cracks his head and theyve got him
The nitro was canola oil I know more
fucked-up bank robbers than ones that
now what theyre doing I doubt one
in ten can tell a dye pack when he
sees one Most bank robbers are fucking
morons To go to bed with a bank robber
for kinky thrills as you say youd
have to be as dumb as they are I
now youre not dumb so why would I
think that Why would you think I
might think that

She comes over and sits down on the bed

KAREN
