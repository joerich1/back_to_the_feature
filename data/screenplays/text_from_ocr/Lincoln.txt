EXT SPRINGFIELD DAY

LINCOLN is posing for a campaign-trail photograph outside his house He stands with
sleeves rolled up a five-foot straight log in one hand a large axe in the other A
PHOTOGRAPHER is bent over his camera There’s a small CROWD of spectators

GRACE BEDELL (VO)
October 15 1860 Honest Abe Lincoln Dear Sir J am a little girl only
eleven years old but want you should be President of the United States
very much

The flash goes off and the photo is done Applause from the CROWD as LINCOLN smiles
and relaxes Then with one easy movement he lets go the log and while it’s balanced in
the vertical he splits it in two It’s an impresstve show of coordination and strength —
Jrom a six-feet four athletic fifty year-old His lean cleanshaven face is the face of a
man in his prime

INT TOWN HOUSE DAY

GRACE BEDELL a pretty dark-haired eleven year-old sits at a kitchen table reading
dloud a letter she’s just finished writing Next to Grace a small baby sieeps in a rocking-
cradle As GRACE reads she rocks the cradle with her foot In front of Grace on the table
is a presidential campaign picture of Abraham Lincoln Honest Abe the ‘raii-splitter’
candidate To emphasise the point the picture has a decorative border of rail fencing

GRACE BEDELL
hope you won’t think me very bold to write to such a great man as
you are Have you any little girls about as large as I am if so give her my
love and tell her to write to me I have got four brothers and part of them
will vote for you any way and if you will let your whiskers grow I will try
and get the rest of them to vote for you You would look a great deal better
for your face is so thin All the ladies like whiskers and they would tease
their husbands to vote for you and then you would be President

GRACE has stopped rocking the cradle The BABY whimpers The BABY is awake
smiling up at Grace GRACE BEDELL ail love and competence rocks the cradle with
her foot then picks up her pen and writes

GRACE BEDELL (VO)
(proudly) have got a little baby sister she is nine weeks old and is just as
cunning as can be (pause) I must not write any more

INT LINCOLN’S HOUSE NIGHT

LINCOLN is siiting at a small writing-desk answering correspondence a large quantity
of which lies all over the desk It’s late and Lincoin is tired Hes reading a letter with a
soft smile on his clean-shaven face
GRACE BEDELL (VO
Answer this letter right off Goodbye Grace Bedell

EXT SPRINGFIELD STATION DAWN
Three months later A four-car Presidential train decked out in celebratory flags and
inaugural banners waits in the station steam gently hissing in the cold and sleet

INT LINCOLN’S HOUSE DAWN

The first thing we notice — as LINCOLN knots a rope around a wrunk then writes on the
label ‘A Lincoln White House’ — is that he’s grown a beard MARY Lincoln enters a
girlish forty year-old still sleepy in her nightdress but radiant with pride They embrace

INT BARBER SHOP DAY

BILLY THE BARBER a black man has just finished cutting LINCOLN’s hair and beard
BILLY fusses around Lincoln brushing his neck and shoulders then for a moment they
just stand and smile at each other LINCOLN puts out his hand BILLY clasps it with both
hands

INT LAW OFKICE DAY

Two men sit facing each other Abraham LINCOLN and his law parmer of twenty years
Billy HERNDON some years younger than Lincoln and his junior in every sense
Everything’s been said and all that’s left is the parting LINCOLN smiling sadly slowly
gets up from his chair followed by HERNDON wha has tears in his eyes as they shake
hands

EXT OUTSIDE LAW OFFICE DAY

Watched by Billy HERNDON LINCOLN steps out of the office onto the sireet He gives
the sign on the office front - ‘Lincoln and Herndon — Law Practitioners’ - a look of fond
farewell before he’s surrounded by WELL-WISHERS and OFFICE RS

EXT CEMETERY DAY

It’s sleeting heavily now LINCOLN stands in front of a grave his arm round MARY who
is weeping The gravestone reads ‘Edward Todd Lincoln born 1845 died 1850’
LINCOLN moves forward pulls off a glove puts the hand to his lips then places ti on the
headstone The big hand tenses taking a powerful grip on the stone before relaxing and
letting go as he turns and guides MARY away
EXT SPRINGFIELD STATION DAY

A large CROWD has gathered to see their man off to the White House Billy HERNDON
is at the front There’s a brass BAND playing an up-tempo version of ‘When Johnny
Comes Marching Home’ The sleet has turned to rain LINCOLN MARY and their three
sons - TAD 7 WILLIE 10 ROBERT 17 — stand on the platform at the back of the
Presidential car LINCOLN lifis his hand in farewell We rise into the mist and rain as
below us the train begins to pull out

A MONTAGE SEQUENCE

To the sound of the band playing ‘When Johnny Come Marching Home’ the
Presidential train pulls in and out of stations past people gathered in cities villages or
Just alongside the track in the middle of nowhere Farmhands wave in fields children
wave from bridges as the train passes beneath

EXT WESTFIELD STATION DAY
LINCOLN is standing on the rear platform and addressing a CROWD at a station whose
sign reads ‘Westfield’ He’s grown a beard

LINCOLN
Three months ago I received a very pretty letter from a young lady who
lives here advising me to let my whiskers grow Well the letter was
certainly prettier than the result — but 1 wonder is there a Miss Grace
Bedell here

Silence The camera reveals GRACE BEDELL is indeed present — but is too shy to
announce herself Then a sudden cry

BOY
There she is

A BOY sitting on a post points to GRACE BEDELL She’s standing with her FATHER
and MOTHER who holds the five-month old BABY girl in her arms LINCOLN walks
over to GRACE BEDELL and lifts her up in his arms

LINCOLN
What do you think Grace Am improved

GRACE BEDELL just smiles at him for a moment inspecting him in that self-possessed
way of hers

GRACE BEDELL
(decidedly) Ves (her FATHER prompts her and she adds) Mr President
LINCOLN kisses her on both cheeks and lowers her to the floor

LINCOLN
(a hint of sad finality) Goodbye Grace

LINCOLN turns and walks back to the train amidst loud cheers

TITLES END

EXT WASHINGTON DAY

Washington Inauguration Day March 1861 A wide shot shows contstruction of the
Capitol Dome has barely begun Nearby Inauguration guests and officials are taking
their seats on the podium Beyond and below them a crowd is gathered and waiting
Closer shots reveal sharpshooters positioned at various vantage points including the
rim of the nascent Capitol dome soldiers blocking off side roads onto the procession
route soldiers searching people soldiers manning a light artillery battery on Capitol
Hill

LINCOLN (VO)
Fellow citizens of the United States I appear before you to address you
briefly and to take in your presence the oath prescribed by the
Constitution of the United States Apprehension scems to exist among
the people of the Southern States that by the accession of a Republican
Administration their property and their peace and personal security are
to be endangered

EXT CAPITOL WALKWAY DAY

A covered walkway It’s normally open on both sides but has been shuttered by
temporary bullet-proof steel barriers SOLDIERS are posted at intervals along these
shieids

LINCOLN (VO)
I declare that ‘I have no purpose directly or indirectly
to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists

INT CAPITOL WALE WAY DAY

LINCOLN surrounded by a small group of DIGNITARIES with SOLDIERS in front and
behind walks along the sealed walkway in silence LINCOLN’s long easy stride makes
him seem to glide while some of the DIGNITARIES have almost to scurry LINCOLN is
calm and dignified

LINCOLN (VO)
believe I have no lawful right to do so and I have no inclination to do
so’

EXT INAUGURAL PODIUM DAY

Cut to LINCOLN on the podium poised to deliver the two final inspired paragraphs of
his Address Hes surrounded by grave faces His voice is strong but natural without the
cultivated richness of the professional orator It’s a little on the high side but remarkably
clear and carrying resonant with sincerity and conviction

LINCOLN
One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be
extended while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be
extended This is the only substantial dispute

To your hands my dissatisfied fellow countrymen and not in mine is the
momentous issue of civil war The government will not assail you You
can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors You have
no oath registered in Heaven to destroy the government while J shall have
the most solemn one to “preserve protect and defend” it

A long heartfelt pause

I am loth to close We are not enemies but friends We must not be
enennes Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds
of affection The mystic chords of memory stretching from every
battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over
this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the Union when again
touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature

LINCOLN folds his papers amidst silence far and wide

INT LINCOLN’S BEDROOM DAY

The day after the Inauguration and the morning of the first cabinet meeting MARY is
proudly tidying her husband LINCOLN acts patient but he’s enjoying this moment as
much us she She stops wiping and smoothing looks satisfied then looks at his hair and
sighs She picks up a brush He gives a groan of reluctance

LINCOLN
Mother I’m going to be late

MARY
They ll wait Come down

LINCOLN hends all the way down to her and she brushes his hair

La
MARY
Good

LINCOLN grins and kisses her MARY takes hold of his face and looks into his eyes

MARY
When you walk into that room remember every man in it wants your job
Seward and Chase think it’s theirs by right - and that you are a second-rate
compromise candidate who fluked bis way into office and is completely
out of his depth

LINCOEN smiles
LINCOLN

Mother Do you have to sound so convincing

INT WHITE HOUSE DAY
LINCOLN strides down a corridor towards a half-open door

INT HAWS OFFICE DAY
HAY lounges at a desk waiting HAY is an attractive spirited young man in his mid-
twenties — and Lincolns secretary
HAY
Good morning Mr President

LINCOLN grins at him HAY grins back congratulatory delighted

LINCOLN
Alright John Let’s go
ENT WHITEHOUSE HALL DAY

A few hundred OP FICE-SEEKERS PETITIONERS and curious VISITORS mill around
in the main entrance hall

CHASE (VO)
It’s a bear-park down there Me’s told his staffto admit anyone anyone -
who wants to see him

NT CABINET ROOM DAY
Seven men — Lincoln’s cabinet — are seated around a large table waiting
CHASE
And we have one hour The country in crisis and he decides to give his
cabinet one hour So the rest of the day can be passed in conversation with
nonentities

SEWARD - more urbane than Chase less intense smiles

SEWARD
He’s a man of the people Chase Man of the people

CAMERON
And what must hurt is a little more of the common touch from either of
you at the convention - he’d be sitting there right now waiting for one of

you
BATES
That’s assuming either one of them would invite his chief rival into his
cabinet
SEWARD

Oh Pd have chosen Honest Abe for my cabinet You Chase

CHASE remains coldly silent SEWARD smiles to himself

INT WHITE HOUSE DAY

LINCOLN HAY and NICOLAY approach a door LINCOLN pauses before it and raises
his hand to give a polite knock then stops He gives HAY and NICOLAY a little smile
and a gesture which says ‘Of course I’m the President dont have to knock’ He opens
the door

INT CABINET ROOM DAY
Prom Lincoln’s POV seven men get to their feet and look at him

LINCOLN

Morning gentlemen

VARIOUS
Momuing Mr President

LINCOLN

“You know my secretary Mr John Hay

They do LINCOLN and HAY take their seats
LINCOLN
Gentlemen I’m here to listen to anything you want to say

INT WHITEHOUSE DAY

A wide shot of the Hall and the CROWD of petitioners office-seekers and curious
members of the public We go closer and find MARY meandering alone and
unrecognised listening and observing MARY pauses by a group of CRITICAL LADIES

CRITICAL LADY I
Well I know of several finer houses in this town alone

CRITICAL LADY 2
It’s so faded and jaded Looks like a run-down second-rate country hotel

CRITICAL LADY 1
But it’ll took like a palace to the Lincolns They’re Westerners remember
He was born and brought up in a one-room log cabin Can you immagine the
squalor

CRITICAL LADY 3
They will not have an idea about style How could they poor things

MARY doesn’t look offended just thoughtful She moves off

INT CABINET ROOM DAY
Continuation of the cabinet meeting Treasury Secretary Salmon CHASE a leading
Abolitionist is holding forth in typically lofty moral tone

CHASE
The Republican Party we serve was created to oppose the spread of
slavery Now the slave owners’ rebellion makes the outright abolition of
that disgraceful institution a political as well as moral necessity God has
placed in our hands a sacred opportunity and a sacred duty the destruction
of servitude the establishment of liberty and the fulfilment of this
nation’s destiny

They wait for LINCOLN to respond To CHASE’s irritation LINCOLN remains silent
SEWARD steps into the vacuum

SEWARD
I’d like to mention a more mundane matter Mr President Despite the
admirable certainties expressed by the Secretary for the Treasury the fact
remains this administration has no clear staternent of policy Which in the
country means we have no policy I respectfully suggest it’s time we did
(a brief pause) As Secretary of State J believe I can best assist you Mr
President this cabinet and the country by drawing up a statement of
general policy as soon as posible

SEWARD is making an innocuous-sounding but in fact bold play to pick up the reins of
power He looks calmly into LINCOLN’s eyes — which betray a glint of amusement even
appreciation LINCOLN admires the nerve and style of this man

LINCOLN
Thank-you Mr Seward

Is that a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ LINCOLN picks up his glasses and begins to spin them between
thumb and forefinger A strange suspense takes hold as SEWARD and the CABINET wait
for Lincoln to speak again The spin of the spectacles is becoming hypnotic Bang The
moment is shattered by a crash against the door so loud some of the CABINET start in
alarm Then theres laughter and a commotion as the door Jlies open to reveal WILLIE
holding the halter of a GOAT harnessed to a box containing TAD WILLIE immediately
drives the GOAT and TAD into and around the room

WILLIE
Look Pa We made a chariot

LINCOLN bursts into laughter The CABINET is appalled

LINCOLN
Boys Boys John Get these rascals out of here

The BOYS take not a jot of notice A small table and chair 20 flying Chaos reigns Shock
and disapproval on CABINET faces John HAY gets up holds the door open wide and
shouts

HAY
Willie Tad (cracking up) You are not members of this cabinet And
neither is that goat

LINCOLN
Not that he didn’t receive serious consideration

At this HAY cracks up completely LINCOLN too Most of the CABINE are unamused

HAY
Willie Tad Our

WILLIE decides to oblige and the chariot team continues on its way leaving a stunned
cabinet behind it SEWARD looks suspicious as if he’s wondering whether the stunt was
somehow contrived to undermine him and the meeting (Its timing was so perfect) HAY
closes the door and sits down still grinning LINCOLN too

LINCOLN
I’m sorry gentlemen but they’re young Time enough for them to get old
and pokey

CHASE gives Lincoln a look of utter incomprehension Hes at a loss

LINCOLN
Mr Chase Do you know the story about the young man about to go to war
whose sisters were embroidering his belt

CHASE
(irritated) No

LINCOLN
They were embroidering his belt with the words ‘Victory Or Death”
“Victory or Death’’ said the young man ‘Oh no no’ he said ‘don’t put
it quite that strong Put it “Victory Or Get Hurt Pretty Bad”

LINCOLN beams and chuckles SEWARD grins HAY smothers his laughter

LINCOLN
My point Mr Chase is that your tone just now reminded of those sisters 1
see more the young man’s point of view I’m not sure any cause justifies
the destruction of human life In other words Mr Chase I want very much
to avoid a war (pause without bitterness or self-pity) My father instead
of sending me to school would put me to work for neighbouring dirt-
farmers Servitude is not something about which I feel indifference If
slavery is not wrong nothing is wrong But my primary duty be it sacred
or any other kind is nof to abolish slavery My primary duty your
collective task and (looks at Seward) the entire policy of this
administration is to hold this country together To preserve the Union All
else is secondary Because from that preservation all else will flow

LINCOLN gets slowly to his feet It’s over

LINCOLN
Thank-you gentlemen Well meet again in four days When there’ll be
plenty of official business Meanwhile forgive me but have an
appointment

LINCOLN leaves followed by HAY HAY is trying not to grin SEWARD stares after
Lincola for moment then lights a thin cigar He’s thoughiful — and impressed
SEWARD
Not bad - for a boy who had to teach himself to read and write

CHASE
You think a man who can’t control his children can run a country And
handle a crisis of this magnitude

SEWARDs expression is non-commital for a moment

SEWARD
Well Chase

SEWARD takes a puff on his cigar turns and looks at Chase

SEWARD
he certainly handled us

INT WHITEHOUSE NIGHT

MARY sweeps along the corridor leading to Lincoln’s Office Theres a line of OFFICE-
SEEKERS many asleep lined up waiting to see Lincoln Managing the queue is an old

MARY

place fit for the President of the United States A place the people can be
proud of A place which tells them the Administration is strong and well
And knows what itis doing

LINCOLN is being persuaded Above them unseen small pieces of paper are falling
through the air MARY turns to LINCOLN

MARY
I’m so pround of you darling (eyes moving around the hall seeing a

transformed White House) And I’m going to make you proud of me

LINCOLN

Vm already proud of you I always have been

INT WHITE HOUSE DAY

WILLIE and TAD are at lessons with a GOVERNESS TAD is clearly unhappy and
struggling WILLIE finishes writing and puts down his pen He watches TAD struggling
with a look of concern The GOVERNESS picks up Willies book and reads She is
seriously impressed This is a gifted child

GOVERNESS
Oh this is wonderful William Listen to this Thomas —-

WILLIE
No don’t

The GOVERNESS looks at Willie and understands He doesn’t want his cleverness
paraded before his already demoralised brother

GOVERNESS
Alright William You can go Your mother’s waiting Thomas and I will
have to persevere a little longer

As WILLUE begins to leave she turns to Tad and looks down at his dyslexic scrawl with a
despondent sigh

INT WHITE HOUSE DAY
MARY sits next to WILLIE listening to him play the piano He’s good naturally MARY
is pleased He stops playing abruptly

WILLIE
Ma Can I go and get Tad now He’s been in that lesson too long

INT WHITE HOUSE DAY

TAD is manfully but miserably struggling on with a writing exercise The GOVERNESS
not an unkind woman looks on despondently WILLIE enters and without a word walks
over to TAD takes him by the hand and leads him gently out of the room WILLIE
pauses as he’s about to close the door He gives the GOVERNESS a sweetly apologetic
smile The door closes behind them leaving the GQVERNESS looking somewhat helpless
bué understanding

EXT WHITE HOUSE ROOF EARLY EVENING
LINCOLN walks out onto the flat roof carrying three four-foot logs under each arm
Slung over his back is a telescope WILLIE and TAD have built mock fortifications and
gun-emplacements with sandbags along the parapet Theyre happily painting a couple of
logs black to resemble cannons

LINCOLN
Here’s the rest of your artillery boys

LINCOLN puts down the logs His face is very close to Tad’s LINCOLN smiles at him
TAD stops painting only long enough to give the grin of a boy whos having such a good
time he can hardly bear it

TAD
Ankshpa (Thanks Pal)

TAD’s speech is hard to understand It’s immature comes in a rush and is scrambled by
a speech impediment But this only adds charm to his enthusiasm WILLIE gives his
father a glowing smile In this one look we see the maturity of Willie and the depth of his
love for his father LINCOLN raises the telescope to his eye

EXT FORT SUMTER DAY
Seen through a telescope above Fort Sumter a fortress on an island out in the bay
beyond Charleston Harbour flies the Union flag

EXT CHARLESTON HARBOUR DAY

CROWD of civilians starts cheering and throwing hats in the air

INT LINCOLN’S OFKICK DAY

LINCOLN appalled stares at a telegram He looks up at HAY standing nearby having
just handed Lincoln the telegram HAY’s eyes are full of empathy and regret LINCOLN
slumps back in his chair as if suddenly exhausted

EAT FORT SUMTER DAWN
The Confederate flag is raised over the ruins of Fort Sumter

EXT CHARLESTON HARBOUR DAY
Scenes of jubilation amongst the crowds watching the flag go up over the fort
INT LINCOLN’S OFFICE DAY

Crisis atmosphere General SCOTT commander of the US Army - is addressing
LINCOLN and the CABINET He’s a huge 75 year-old fast losing a war against old age
tightly clad in a splendid uniform He looks like something from a bygone age
Nevertheless Scott is an experienced and highly respected commander Hes standing in
front of a large wall-map of the once-United States using a stout walking cane as a
pointer The map picks out the Confederate states the Border States and the Union states
in different colours

SCOTT
The attack on Fort Sumter — an army outpost in a southern harbour - was a
symbolic gesture more an assertion of independence than an act of war
Secession is by definition defensive and isolationist not aggressive Our
response should be to establish a naval bockade of rebel ports take
control of the Mississippi from Cairo to the Gulf of Mexico sealing off
the entire Confederacy politically and economically Then wait For pro-
Union sentiment and good sense in general to force their leaders to
negotiate peace - and re-unification (pause) While we need most
assuredly go to arms - there is no need to go to war This rebellion can be
put down without spilling one drop of Northern blood

SCOTTS final flourish resounds with confidence But LINCOLN’s expression doesn’t
change - he just stares thoughtfully at the map

LINCOLN
General find your analysis and your strategy appealing Very appealing
(brief pause) J have two concerns Effective isolation of a resourceful
people occupying a vast area is difficult to achieve Even if achieved it
could require years of commitment — human and financial - to take effect
(pause) Vm a patient man by nature General But I’m not prepared to wait
years for an uncertain outcome

SEWARD
(searchingly) But are you truly prepared to let slip the dogs of war

LINCOLN looks at Seward for a moment then pauses thoughtfully and smiles

LINCOLN
I remember before the Mexican War broke out there was a lot of
excitement in Springfield Even the old town loafer caught it He said
Damn feel so patriotic’ T asked him what he meant “Well” he said ‘T
feel like I want to kill somebody or steal something

LINCOLN chuckles affectionately at the memory of the old miscreant
CHASE
Can we be clear on your point Mr President

LINCOLN
My point is there’s a great deal of patriotism out there On both sides
(pause) Take a telescope to the roof of this building and you can sce rebel
flags just across the Potomac Only aventy-six miles from here there’s a
Confederate army gathering at Bull Run (pause) General I’m not prepared
to accept a military strategy based on the arrogant assumption that the
other man won’t fight Particularly when he’s just a day’s march down the
road

Demolition complete The GENERAL looks pained and humiliated

LINCOLN
I’ve delayed this too long - because believed it would be inflammatory
I’m going to issue a proclamation instructing the loyal states to start
recruiting urgently I want 75000 men in uniform as soon as possible

INT WHITEHOUSE NIGHT

LINCOLN strides towards the porch of the main entrance A carriage has drawn up
outside There’s distant lightning flickering and thunder rumbling SCOTT ts about to
hobble out to his carriage

LINCOLN
General

SCOTT turns LINCOEN comes up to him close

LINCOLN
’ General I was too hard-pounding in there just now J ask your forgiveness
SCOTT
(touched dismissing it Ohh Sir
LINCOLN

i very much hope you will remain in overall command of the army but I
alse need someone to lead that army in the field

Brief pause

SCOTT
Lee Colonel Robert E Lee
INT LINCOLN’S OFFICE NIGHT

There’s a thunderstorm rumbling outside Lightning flickers at the window LINCOLN is
sitting at his desk Opposite him standing too unhappy to sit is a distinguished-looking
Officer in US Army uniform Colonel Robert EB LEE There’s been a long silence as LEE
agonises

LEE
Mr Lincoln I see secession as anarchy I’d free every slave in the South
for the sake of the Union But lead an army against my own state Against
my home my family my friends I could not do that

Silence The air is full of bitter regret LINCOLN nods — with acceptance and
understanding

LINCOLN
What will you do Colonel

LEE stares at Lincoln for a moment

LEE
Resign my commission Go home
LINCOLN
And
LEE

Stay there Until the country returns to its senses

LINCOLN looks at LEE with sympethy and understanding

INT CABINET ROOM DAY
Close-up of General MCDOWELL

SCOTT (OPF-CAMERA
General McDowell has presented his plan of battle Which 1 filly support

The room contains LINCOLN John HAY the CABINET General SCOTT and
McDOWELL who looks like a younger version of Scott There’s a large detailed hand
drawn map of the Confederate positions at Bull Run hanging over the printed map of
North America The atmosphere in the room is momentous and troubled

SCOTT
At the same time fidly share his reservations The General needs more
time to train and to discipline
Silence

CHASE
The country has been screaming ‘Onward to Richmond’ for weeks now
No administration can risk losing the confidence of the people by
prolonged inaction

SEWARD
No But there’s a quicker way defeat

Stalemate Everyone waits for LINCOLN to speak When he does it’s the lawyer we hear

LINCOLN
(to McDowell) In the Virginia theatre we have 50000 facing 30000
Youre green it’s true but they’re green also you’re all green alike The
argument for action is numerical superiority - an advantage we possess
now but may not possess much tonger That General is why I believe we
should fight them Now

General approval from the CABINET with the exception of SEWARD who looks neutral
Silence from the MILITARY MCDOWELL looks at Scott SCOTT gives him a look which
says ‘Thats an order What can Ido’

INT WHITE HOUSE NIGHT

MARY is in bed asleep There’s a thunderstorm outside She’s woken by a clap of
thunder and is immediately terrified She steadies herself then gets out of bed and
opens the connecting door to Lincolns bedroom His bedside lamp is on but Lincoin’s
bed is empty There’s a book lying on the covers MARY walks over and picks it up Its
‘Elements of Military Art and Science’ by Henry W Halleck A louder clap of thunder
shatters her fragile composure She drops the book on the floor and heads for the main
door

iNT LINCOILN’S GRICE NIGHT

LINCOLN is in his nightshirt studying a map This is a man in a state of debilitating
anxiety MARY enters He looks up and emerging from his absorption hears the storm
for the first time

LINCOLN
Ohh Mother I’m sorry 1 didn’t hear the storm

MARY
Don’t worry It’s an Eastern affair all fuss and feathers

He opens his arms and she goes over to him He Jolds his long arms around her While
remaining nervous about the storm her concern Jor him becomes dominant

MARY
It’s four o’clock in the morming You’re a strong man But you must sleep
or youll become weak And you cannot allow yourself to do that
Because you are the Commander In Chief No-one else And no-one else
can save this courtry

LINCOLN
Please don’t tell me that

MARY
I must Because in times like these there is only ever one

INT WHITEHOUSE NIGHT

The Bad Dream LINCOLN is wandering along endless corridors searching for the
source of a mysterious noise men and women sobbing with grief He passes a number of
doors then stops in front of one The sobbing is coming from the other side He takes hold
of the handle and slowly begins to open the door

GUNNER

Nervous cheers and laughter from the GUN-CREWS The camera pulls back to show the
UNION FORCES advancing towards the Bull Run river and the CONFEDERATE
FORCES on higher ground on the other side

EXT PICNIC HELLSIDE DAY
A group of picnickers is settled down on rugs two foppish BEAUX and two LADIES
The LADIES have opera glasses the BEAUX have telescopes

PICNICKERS ruuning scrambling into buggies and carriages whipping up horses In a
Jew moments it looks from a distance like a mad reckless cross-country race the start
of a landrush We go closer and see carriages crash into one another and overturn as
they converge on the road

EXT BULL RUN DAY
UNION FORCES under fire and in extreme disorder retreat across a ford in the river

But the numbers are such that most of the soldiers are forced into deeper waters where
pressure from soldiers piling in behind creates a desperate struggle to stay upright non-
swimmers thrashing at the margins as they begin to drown The ord itself is becoming
clogged with fallen bodies SOLDIERS turn to extricate fallen friends and comrades but
are driven back General MCDOWELL comes riding along the bank with a couple of
AIDES

McDOWELL
Reform men Reform We must reform and counterattack

Here and there SOLDIERS steady and regroup but ave swept into disarray by the
majority who just keep on going throwing down their weapons as full-scale panic takes
hold SOLDIERS trample over dying and wounded in the river repeatedly forcing them
under until their strength is gone and all they can do is drown Bodies float gently
downstream except when heaved into the air or onto the banks by cannon fire

McDOWELL has reined in motionless siaring at irreversible defeat as soldiers flood
past ignoring him A strange sound rises in the distance its Savage intensity piercing the
noise of batile MecDOWELL looks acrass the river to the brow of the hill opposite as
CONFEDERATES pour over it in a bayonet charge yelling like f The sound rises
and rises MCDOWELL is horrified It’s the first time MCDOWELL has witnessed froOops

INT LINCOLN’S OFFICE NIGHT
LINCOLN is alone expressionless lying on the chaise-longue and staring ot the wall
The door opens and MARY appears She stays in the doorway She doesn’t know what to
say LINCOLN looks at her still expressionless MARY doesnt move just gazes back at
him with a look of pain and pity LINCOLN gives her a sad affectionate smile and lifis a
hand as if to say ‘Don’t worry No use talking to me anyway Forgive me sweetheart
but you go on I need to stay here and think for a while’ MARY closes the door

INT OUTSIDE LINCOLN’S OFFICE NIGHT
MARY stands motionless hand still on the door handle staring at the door struggling
against an overpowering sense of loss and exclusion She turns and walks sadly away

INT SENATE HOUSE NIGHT

The camera moves through the high spaces of the Senate Chamber past coloured
marbles and ceiling paintings glowing in the flickering light As we descend strange
sounds begin to feed in — becoming cries of pain and screams of agony Finally we reach
the floor to see the the Senate Chamber has been transformed into a huge charnel house
of an operating theatre

INT LINCOLN’S OFFICE DAWN

LINCOLN is still on the chaise-longue staring at nothing He hasnt moved all night
Then he gets slowly to his feet and moves to his desk He sits down takes a clean sheet of
paper picks up a pen and writes ‘Memoranda of Military Policy Suggested by the Bull
Run Defeat’ He underscores the heading and continues writing quickly fluently and
effortlessly — it’s all there in his head

INT CORRIDOR MORNING
Still early LINCOLN walks quietly along the corridor holding a few sheets of paper in
his hand He opens a door

INT TAD’S BEDROOM MORNING
TAD’s bed is empty

INT CORRIDOR MORNING
LINCOLN gives a little smile of the empty bed moves on and opens another door

INT WILLIK’S BEDROOM MORNING

TAD and WILLIE ave asleep in Willie’s bed They look angelic and profoundly
peaceful LINCOLN framed in the doorway watches them for a Jew seconds then quietly
closes the door

INT MARY’S BEDROOM MORNING

MARY has fallen asleep fully dressed on the bed LINCOLN enters MARY wakes
LINCOLN still holding his memoranda walks over to her He offers his hand and she
takes it She lies there without moving looking up at him He smiles down at her a sad
but strong encouraging smile

INT HOSPITAL DAY

An OFFICER shows LINCOLN and MARY into a huge public hall that’s now crammed
with beds of all kinds many of them makeshifi containing wounded and dying sodiers
MARY cannot hide her horror She recoils and nearly faints A NURSE takes MARY out
LINCOLN moves forward amidst the beds We see in his face the immense and formative
impact the terrible scene makes on him He seems literally and metaphorically to age
before our eyes

EXT CAMP DAY

LINCOLN flanked by a chastened-looking McDOWELL and a couple of his OFFICERS
rides at walking pace through an army camp its a demoralised disorganised mess
SOLDIERS are sitting or lying around quiet and listless As LINCOLN passes by some
SOLDIERS get to their feet to see whats happening

EXT CAMP DAY

Hundreds of SOLDIERS have gathered together others still moving onto the fringes At
their centre is the tall imposing figure of LINCOLN on horseback Around LINCOLN’s
humane caring presence a mood is taking hold — theyre silent and ashamed waiting for
Lincoln to speak like sinners hoping for absolution As he looks around at their needy
trusting faces LINCOLN is deeply moved

LINCOLN
Gentlemen You do me too much honour

For a moment he’s lost for words A powerfid pulse of empathy and understanding passes
between LINCOLN and the SOLDIERS LINCOLN goes on looking into their faces — as if
he wants to look into the eyes of every man he sent into battle A voice comes out of the
crowd

SOLDIER I
We let you down Abe

LINCOLN shakes his head and murmurs

LINCOLN
NoNo

SOLDIER 2
We ran like jack-rabbits

The briefest of silences

SOLDIER 3
I ran faster than that

A ripple of laughter LINCOLN gives a sudden grin

LINCOLN
I never knew but one man could run like that Jimmy Hanson Friend of
mine back when we were both young men in Illinois Jimmy was sparking
this fine looking girl — with some success But the girl’s father took such a
dislike to Jimray he threatened to shoot him ifhe ever caught him on the
farm again Then one evening Jimmy hears the old man’s gone to the city
and he ventures out to the girl’s house He’s sitting in the parlour with his
arm round the girl’s waist when suddenly he sees the old man coming
round the corner of the house with a shotgun in his hand In two seconds
flat Jimmy’s out the window and travelling along the garden path like
greased lightning - when out in front of him jumps this jack-rabbit In
about two strides Jimmy’s right up behind him Jimmy gives the rabbit a
great kick up in the air and he yells ‘Out of the road gosh dern you and
let somebody ran that knows how”

LINCOEN grins and chuckles as warm appreciative laughter moves through the crowd
gathering strength Then LINCOLN raises his hand in an appeal for silence LINCOLN
pauses The silence is profound

LINCOLN
You are not responsible for what happened yesterday That responsibility
is mine asked too much foo soon Of you and your officers We have
learned a hard lesson and having learned it we can gather strength and we
can go on and win this fight But only if yow’ll stay with me for as long as
it takes If you’ll re-enlist to serve our country throughout the hour of its
greatest need (pause) If you do I promise you J will not spare myself to
give you every possible means of support (pause) So tell me Are we
touether on this

A roar of affirmation He has won them completely Cheer after cheer
INT LINCOILN’S OFFICH DAY

The CABINET plus SCOTT is reading a four-page document Lincolns ‘Memoranda of
Military Policy Suggested by the Buli Run Defeat’ written just a few hours before - in a
collectively awed silence HAY watches them with a degree of satisfaction SEWARD
closes the document purses his lips and looks profoundly mystified

SEWARD
He’s covered everything A total reorganisation of the amy a move
towards a new three-year enlistment policy retraining of officers
dismissal of incompetents a new strategy embracing every theatre of
war on the continent even international relations it’s staggering
No-one I’ve ever known could’ve produced this overnight let alone last
night

CHASE
it was probably done earlier As a contingency

SEWARD
(smiling shaking his head) Chase Chase That’s beneath you
Beneath all of us

LINCOLN enters pale with fatigue LINCOLN lowers himself into a chair and gathers
himself

LINCOLN
EL owe everyone in this room and particularly you General an apology 1
failed to understand that green troops against green isn’t an equal
equation it’s a lottery I was seduced by the easy notion of a single
decisive blow By the idea that the rebels would collapse after a single
defeat But the fact is they were no more going to do that than we are now

Slow reluctant murmurs of agreement Silence

LINCOLN
Has everyone had time to read this

Nods and murmurs of ‘ves’

LINCOLN
Any reactions

SEWARD
Yes

Brief silence as SEWARD returns LINCOLN’s steady vane
Z YB

SEWARD
Hail

SEWARD raises the document in one hand

SEWARD
Hail to the chief

A moment between LINCOLN and SEWARD LINCOLN looks at every face in the room
and senses unity LINCOLN gives a brief humble smile and a barely perceptible nod of
the head

INT TREMONT HALL NIGHT

An Abolitionist rally DOUGLASS is addressing a crowd of black and white
ABOLITIONISTS Banners proclaim ‘No Union With Slavery’ ‘A Fight For The Union
Must Be A Fight For Abolition’ DOUGLASS is very powerful rhetorician with a
masterful range of tone and emotion

DOUGLASS
So now at last Mr Lincoln understands this is a country at war But at war
for what That it seems is something our President has yet to
comprehend This is a war caused by slavery and being fought by our
enemies to preserve slavery And yet this President tells us it has nothing
to do with slavery But this is the man I heard with my own ears in this
very place precisely where I stand before you tonight speak these
wonderful words ‘Let us have faith that right makes might and in that
faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand it’ (pause)
‘Paith’ “Right’ “Dare” Duty’ Oh yes indeed Mr Lincoln Yes
indeed Noble words and a noble sentiment

A group of suspicious-looking men in bulky coats quietly filter in at the back of the hall
unnoticed by most people in the audience (These men will shortly be revealed as anti-
abolitionist THUGS) DOUGLASS sees them however and we see the flicker of
recognition in his eyes before he continues with equal passion

DOUGLASS
So how can thai same man tell us this war is about the survival of
democracy and not about the destruction of slavery About an eternal
Union and nor about the deepest division in our land There can only be
one conclusion our President has no moral certainty and no moral
courage Oh Mr Lincoln when will you understand When will you
comprehend To fight against slave-holders without fighting against
slavery is but a half-hearted business War for the destruction of liberty
must be met with war for the destruction of slavery This is a war for
Abolition

THUG LEADER
(roaring above the general clamour of approval) Bollocks
A shacked silence But DOUGLASS is unjased Hes been expecting this

THUG LEADER
Well fight all right For the Union But not for the nigger

The racist THUGS have taken clubs and bats jrom under their coats Two strong-looking
young black men in the front row either side of the central aisle LEWIS and CHARLES
whom we assume to be Douglasss bodyguards - get to their feet ready to move
DOUGLASS stills them with a gesture

DOUGLASS
This is a private meeting And you are not welcome

THUG LEADER
Oh really Is that right

The THUG LEADER strides up onto the platform brandishing his club DOUGLASS
takes his glasses off and puts ihem in a case The THUG LEADER mounts the platform
grabs hold of Douglasss speech tears it in two and throws the pieces into the air — and
glares coniemptuously and challengingly at Douglass DOUGLASS punches the THUG
LEADER clean off the platform LEWIS and CHARLES surge forward to meet the
RACIST THUGS storming up the aisle The hall erupts into a brawl

INT LINCOLN’S OFFICE NIGHT

That night A clock tells us it’s ten o’clock LINCOLN is reading a newspaper one of
mony piled on his desk The one he’s reading is entitled ‘Douglass Monthly’ HAY comes
in

LINCOLN
You read this

LINCOLN indicates the article

HAY
Yes sir Quite a speech

LINCOLN is suddenly angry — something we see for the first time — with a combination of
personal hurt sheer frustration and above all a fierce intellectual conviction He slams
the paper down on the desk

LINCOLN
Pm surrounded by people who seem to think this war is a damn fine thing
But oven if thai were so - and itis nod - a war with the South cannot be
won without control of the Ohio and the Mississippi And what Chase and

the radical wing of the party and agitators like Frederick Douglass will
not understand - in the ecstasy of their righteousness - is that hey may
demand abolition at the tops of their voices but if J just breathe the word
every one of those Border States could join the Confederacy And if that
happens

LINCOLN’ intensity subsides as he shakes his head hopelessly at the thought

LINCOLN
the bottom is out of the tub

HAY
Never fear Mr President You have God on your side

LINCOLN
John I do hope so (a sudden grin) But I must have Kentucky

EXT BULLSIDE DAY

Several weeks later Two impressive batteries of artillery open up on each side of a wide
hill brow Then between the batteries an immaculate tide of blue infantry crests the hill
and starts moving down the slope in perfect formation Then in a movement of abstract
perfection when seen front distance the solid massed rank of blue infantry begins to split
from front to back into two columns between which comes thundering a large cavalry
formation Cut to

EXT OBSERVATION POST DAY

General George McCLELLAN powerfully-built shortish young strikingly handsome
charismatic — watches the large-scale training manoeuvre He is immaculately dressed
exuding confidence and power He is surrounded by an impressive-looking STAFF Also
present are LINCOLN MARY and Secretary of War Edwin STANTON They are being
studiously ignored by McCLELLAN — who is well pleased with what he sees

McCLELLAN
Excellent Excellent (to his staff) Congratulations gentlemen

the STAFF are thrilled

LINCOLN

Very impressive General

With a deliberate delay which makes it clear he thinks Lincoln is an unnecessary
distraction McCLELLAN turns to LINCOLN

McCLELLAN

(coolly) I’m delighted you think so

McCLELLAN turns back to watch the manoeuvre

EXT ARMY CAMP DAY

An OFFICER escorts LINCOLN MARY and STANTON on horseback through the camp
where we saw Lincoln address the demoralised post-Bull Run troops The camp
previously a shambles is now immaculately organised the SOLDIERS morale high
Lincoln observes the contrast with deep satisfaction

EXT ARMY CAMP DAY
MARY STANTON and some OFFICERS are seated on a low platform before the
TROOPS LINCOLN is addressing them

LINCOLN
cannot recall seeing anything or anyone so quickly and so
dramatically improved as this Amny If I were

LINCOLN pauses as his words are drowned out by a rising commotion coming from the
rear of the TROOPS a commotion quicky resolving into cheering The cheering rises and
inoves forward through the Troops MeCLELLAN appears striding around the far corner
of the front rank The TROOPS cheering and shouting ‘Little Mac’ with somethig close
fo passion are entirely focused on McCLELLAN now as he strides onto the platform

McCLELLAN
My apologies It was a matter of some importance (implying ‘this isn’t’)

LINCOLN waits patiently for the cheering to subside smiling with pleasure at his
General in Chiefs popularity MARY however is furious

INT CARRIAGE DAY
LINCOLN and MARY come away from the Army Camp in closed carriage LINCOLN
erINS

LINCOLN
You don’t like him do you

MARY
No I do not

LINCOLN

Mother George McClellan is recognised as the outstanding soldier of his
generation And he’s certainly the only man J know can lick an entire
army into shape in six weeks

MARY
He’s the only man know can strut sitting down And that six weeks was
three months ago Since then it’s been parades manouevres reviews
When’s he going to do some fighting

LINCOLN looks at her thoughifully

MARY
You know here we are in the White House but more and more I miss the
early days when we were just starting out Because in those days you
valued my opinion Now you don’t even ask for it

LINCOLN gives a her a sad look

LINCOLN
I miss those days too (smiles teasingly) So tell me seriously what is
your considered opinion of George McClellan

MARY gives him a brief intense stare

MARY
i think he’s dangerous And I don’t mean to the Confederacy

EXT BOSTON COMMON BAY

DOUGLASS addresses a crawd outdoors He’s on top form — shifting intriguingly
between passionate outrage and baffled incredulity Hes flanked at a distance by his
sons LEWES and CHARLES who look around warily from time to time ready to defend
their father from attack

DOUGLASS
What on carth is the matter with the American Government and people
Do they really covet the world’s ridicale as well as their own social and
political ruin What are they thinking about or don’t they condescend to
think at all ‘Men Men Send us men’ they scream and yet
steadily and persistently refuse to receive the very class of men which
have a deeper interest in the defeat and humiliation of the rebels than all
others What a spectacle of blind unreasoning prejudice and
pusillanimity is this Why does the Government reject the negro

This continues as VO into

EXT CONTRABAND CAMP DAY

Frederick DOUGLASS is walking through a Contraband Camp - a very overcrowded
refugee camp for slaves who have escaped from the South Wooden huts and tents
comprise the scant accommodation DOUGLASS looks at the JSaces of the MEN he
passes

DOUGLASS (VO)
Is he not a man Can he not wield a sword fire a gon march and obey
orders like any other man Instead of placing the many thousands who had
the courage to escape into the Union in squalid camps or letting our armies
use them as unpaid Jabour — that is as slaves — let us put them in uniform
Let the slaves and free colored people be called into service and formed
into a liberating army to march into the South and raise the banner of
emancipation If persons so humble as we can be allowed to speak to the
President of the United States

LINCOLN (VO)
(picking up from Douglass) We would tell him Men in earnest
don’t fight with one hand when they mi ght fight with two

INT LINCOLN’S OFFICE DAY
LINCOLN holds a newspaper and reads Dougtlass’s speech to SEWARD and HAY

LINCOLN
and a man drowning would not refuse to be saved even by a colored
hand’ (pause) Brilliant No-one could have put it better (deep respect
even incredulity) This man was a slave I’ve bad to worl hard on
occasions but him l can’t imagine how great Azs struggle must have
been

LINCOLN stares at a the newspaper portrait of Douglass We see tt in close-up

INT WHITE HOUSE MAIN IAW DAY

hurrying through the hall with a bundle of different newspapers DOUGLASS senses hig
officiality

approaches

INT WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR DAY

Were looking along a line of OFFICE-SEEKERS and PETITIONERS every one of them
white leading away from Lincolns office door - where the queue is being administrated
by JIMMY an old black member of the White House staff 4 SHARPLY-DRESSED MAN
steps out of Lincoln’s office and closes the door The OFFICE-SEEKERS and
PETITIONERS stare at him the question ‘Well did he give you what you asked for’ in
every eye The SHARPLY-DRESSED MAN strikes a bravura air

SHARPLY-DRESSED MAN
Turned me down Saw straight through me But he was just so
gentlemanly about it

With a smile a flourish of his cane the SHARPLY-DRESSED MAN sets off as HAY
comes walking towards us with DOUGLASS OF FICE-SEEKERS look surprised to see a
black man who judging by his dignified stride alongsidetIAY ts a respected official
visitor The next in the queue a SELF-IMPORTANT MAN hasnt seen them
approaching and steps forward and hands his card to JIMMY with a certain disdain

HAY
Jiramy

JIMMY looks up and sees HAY arrive with DOUGLASS

HAY
Anyone in there

JIMMY returns the card to the Self-lmportant Man with a certain satisfaction

HMMY
No

The SELF-IMPORTANT MAN retreats in a state of shock at being superseded by a black
mon DOUGLASS offers his card and JIMMY takes it
DOUGLASS
Thank-you

without taking his glowing eves off Douglass He doesn’t even glance at the card
before dropping it into the box with dozens of others

JIMMY
Thank-you Mr Douglass

HAY knocks on Lincolns office door and goes in DOUGLASS hesitates staying outside
though the door is open

JIMMY
(quietly urging) Go in

INT LINCOLN’S OFFICE DAY

DOUGLASS enters behind HAY LINCOLN who has seized the moment to go through a
piece of correspondence glances up and seeing only the Jamiliar HAY goes back to the
letter DOUGLASS enters

HAY

LINCOLN immediately gets to his feet smiling broadly

INT WHITE HOUSE CORRIDOR DAY

HIMMY looking at the disgruntled OFFICE-SEEKERS gets up and closes Lincolns
office door with a certain satisfaction He looks down ait the box of cards picks out
Douglasss and places it in his breast pocket — as a souvenir He pais the pocket and sits
down

INT LINCOLN’S OFFICE DAY

Theres a moment as DOUGLASS and LINCOLN take in each other’s powerful
presence Douglass is not as tall as Lincoln but more powerfully built HAY senses his
presence is redundant He turns on his heels and leaves DOUGLASS takes Lincola’s
extended hand saying nothing The handshake is long and slow

LINCOLN
Thank-you for coming

DOUGLASS
It’s an honour
LINCOLN
All mine Mr Douglass All mine ’m very glad to meet you

There is already a sense that these men instinctively like each other

LINCOLN
Sit down

DOUGLASS sits while LINCOLN stays where he is

Brief pause

Silence

LINCOLN
You interest me greatly Mr Douglass I think you are a man of the most
enormous personal achievements

DOUGLASS
Thank-you

LINCOLN
However I believe you regard me with some disappointment

DOUGLASS
Yes sir Ido

LINCOLN
(grinning) Reticence is not normally one of your weaknesses Mr
Douglass

DOUGLASS
Very well You came into office saying you had neither the right nor the
inclination to interfere with slavery Not a good beginning for those of us
who carn see no higher moral purpose in this war than the abolition of
slavery In recent months your entire conduct of the war has been slow and
uncertain - devoid of purpose The navy itis true has done some useful
things But you have an enormous army that does nothing but march and
countermarch along the banks of the Potomac You have a General’ in
Chief who in peace was a declared proslavery pro-Southern Democrat
and who in war behaves as such And you refuse to recruit the very
soldiers who would fight this war out of desire rather than duty as a
righteous war of vengeance to be fought with fire and sword (pause) You
wish me to say more

LINCOLN

That’fl certainly do to be going on with (pause) But first

LINCOLN pulls up a chair and sits down close to Douglass LINCOLN’s eves shine with
an intense curiosity

LINCOLN
Pd like to ask you what is it that drives you

DOUGLASS
The desire to see four million slaves set free

LINCOLN
(with deep respect even envy) Yes (pause) You see what drives me is by
comparison vague even self-centred (intense baring his soul) Ever since
I was a boy I have simply wanted to be remembered Remembered — for
doing something useful for humanity Something good

Well now you have your chance Take it

Mr Douglass I’m by nature a moderate man I’m slow to anger and 1
hope not slow to forgive I have little time for the notion of vengeance
What’s done is done and cannot be undone Certainly not by vengeance
And since seeing the results of one small battle the notion of full-scale
war appails me

DOUGLASS
There is no alternative

LINCOLN looks Douglass in the eve He nods

Silence

LINCOLN
Think you’re right Just that I cannot hurry myself inte the
slaughterhouse

LINCOLN
But now have a question for you If were to offer you a formal
commission to organise the recruitment of black troops would you
accept

DOUGLASS is amazed — and delighted -- by this question

DOUGLASS
When can I start

LINCOLN
When the time is right

DOUGLASS
(disappointed angry) 1 am not a man to be patronised or toyed with

A sudden warm grin from LINCOLN He reaches out and puts a hand on DOUGLASSs
shoulder

LINCOLN
most certainly know that (pause) Mr Douglass m a cautious man —
and youre going to have to be patient with me

The two men look inte each other’s eyes in a frank stare of assessment

stripped of its converings is a carpet Several TRADESMEN are on their knees about to

to witness a glorious transformation as rose-studded brilliant green velvet sweeps across
the floor like an ocean wave strewn with flowers

MARY is the White House Conservatory surrounded by a wonderful variety and
abundance of flowers She’s sad seeming to take consolation in the beauty around her
She cuts a beautiful flower an Iris

Close-up of a vase full of Irises We pull back to see MARY and LINCOLN anxiously
watching a distinguished-looking man DOCTOR ROBERT STONE examine WILLIE
who is semi-delirious with fever

INT CORRIDOR OUTSIDE WILLIE’S ROOM DAY
LINCOLN and MARY listen intently to DOCTOR STONE He addresses himself to Mary
He puts a gentle hand momentarily on her shoulder

DOCTOR STONE
Mrs Lincoln your son is very sick but he’s in no immediate danger
Given his strength and usual good health there is every reason for an early
recovery Every reason

DOCTOR STONE offers LINCOLN his hand in a gesture of sympathy and support They
shake hands briefly DOCTOR STONE leaves Silence Jor a moment or two

MARY
We have to cancel the ball

LINCOLN
Mother Doctor Stone is the best doctor in Washin gton -

MARY
I don’t care what Doctor Stone says I’m his mother and that boy is sick
andi Um frightened couldn’t bear

LINCOLN

LINCOLN moves close and takes her shoulders in his hands

LINCOLN
Mother Eddic was a three year-old child with tuberculosis Willie is a
strong healthy boy with a fever Which will pass (pause) The ball is ten
days away Willie will be on the mend if not recovered And that’ll be
worth a celebration (pause) Youve worked so hard for this — and it Il be
a triumph For you I don’t want you to miss that

MARY looks up at him The look suggests ‘Alright you win But you better be right’

EXT WHITE HOUSE NIGHT

The WHITE HOUSE windows are brilliantly lit in the dark of a February night As we
go closer we see carriages queueing along the drive to the main entrance where people
queue to enter and be announced

INT WHITE HOUSE NIGHT

Everywhere opulence and elegance including striking displays of fresh flowers from the
White House conservatory - as people mingle or wander from room to room admiring
the splendour of the new White House interior Amongst them we pick out the three
CRITICAL WOMEN (whom Mary overheard being condescending in an earlier scene)
Theyre looking around two of them trying their damnedest not to be impressed

CRITICAL WOMAN 1
Well I don’t know which impresses most - the extravagance or the
vulgarity

CRITICAL WOMAN 2
Vulgarity is without question the victor

CRITICAL WOMAN 1
tn what has clearly been an epic contest

CRITICAL WOMAN 3
Well actually Plike it think it’s really rather wonderful

Her two companions look at her in shock then one smiles patronisingly

CRITICAL WOMAN 2
Well I suppose there are certain colours and combinations which are not
entirely offensive

CRITICAL WOMAN 3 looks at her companions as if she’s seeing them for the first time

CRITICAL WOMAN 3
No love it The whole thing It’s just gorgeous

She turns away

CRITICAL WOMAN 1
Jane Where are you going

CRITICAL WOMAN 3
To find Mary Lincoln - and congratulate her

INT WHITE HOUSE NIGHT

We pick out MARY receiving compliments from a GUEST MARY is clearly going
through the motions Shes repeatedly glancing at the stairs and when LINCOLN
looking grave appears at the top of them she becomes totally distracted looking up at
him anxiously

MARY
(to the Guest) That’s very kind Would you forgive me There’s
something I must attend to

MARY moves away heading for the stairs but she’s intercepted by CRITICAL
WOMAN 3

CRITICAL WOMAN 3
Mis Lincoln Mrs Lincoln

MARY pauses

CRITICAL WOMAN 3
Forgive me for breaking in on you for one moment only assure you -
but I just have to say what a magnificent job you have done in this house
Quite magnificent And (risking tone of confidentiality) worth every
penny No matter what anyone says

MARY smiles Shes touched

MARY
Thank-you That’s very kind

Suddenly MARY is trying to hold back tears She briefly touches Critical Woman 3 on the
hand

MARY
Thank-you

Tears well into her eyes as she turns away CRITICAL WOMAN 3 surprised and
concerned watches MARY walk quickly up the stairs We watch her hurry towards
LINCOLN They have a brief but intense exchange — he holds her arm as they talk trying
to give her strength amd reassurance she all anxiety tinged with anger - before MARY
hurries on up the stairs LINCOLN straightens up manufactures a smile and advances
into the party

INT WHITE HOUSE NIGHT
MARY hurries along the corridor She opens the door to Willie’s room

MARY is deeply touched by Willies concern for his brother even approaching extremis

MARY
He doesn’t want to be at some silly party he wants to be with you

WILLIE looks at TAD and puts out his hand TAD holds Willie’s hand TAD has a lost
bewildered look as if sensing his brother is slipping away rom him

INT WHITE HOUSE NIGHT
Downstairs LINCOLN is surrounded by guests whom he is entertaining with an
anecdote

LINCOLN
“ you are the most two-faced individual have ever met’ So I said to
him ‘Now Be reasonable If I had two faces would I be wearing this
one’

Laughter

LINCOLN
Reminds me of the old lady when I was a young man workin gina field
She comes by on her horse then stops looks down at me and says ‘My you
are ugly I think you must be the ugliest young man in the county’ I said
“Well maam I’m sure sorry about it but there’s not a lot lean do about
it’ She said “Well you could’ve stayed home’

More laughter LINCOLN is laughing as loudly as anyone but while he’s laughing hes
glancing up the stairs waiching for Mary

Nothing moves

The NURSE has no answer

INT WELLIE’S ROOM DUSK

MARY is sitting on the bed eyes screwed shut clasping WILLIE’s hand On the other
side of the bed the DOCTOR is rising to his feet having just pronounced Willie dead He
siraighiens and looks at LINCOLN who is standing at the foot of the bed looking at
Willie WILLIE’s corpse is shockingly wasted but the face ig peaceful A few feet from the
bed a NURSE sits in a chair head bowed still The DOCTOR steps close to LINCOLN

DOCTOR
i cannot tell you bow sorry

LINCOLN briefly meets the DOCTOR s eyes and gives a little nod with an expression
which says ‘I know don’t worry know you did your best’

DOCTOR
(to Lincoln but with slight inclination of kis head towards Mary) i shalt
be close by

LINCOLN turns to Willie again as the DOCTOR moves past LINCOLN towards the door
As he does so the NURSE stands and walks with him to the door They leave Now MARY
gives a long ery of agony and utter utter despair - and another and another and
another LINCOLN moves towards her and puts a hand on her shoulder At the touch she
freezes momentarily — before turning away from Willie and clasping him about the waist
with fierce intensity There is nothing pathetic or needy in her action Its ferociously
demanding - and determined to make things otherwise by sheer effort of will

MARY
He’s not dead He’s not dead He’s not dead Look at him Look at him
And tell me know He’s not dead Tell me

LINCOLN holds her genily about the shoulders She looks up at him His eyes move from
hers — all demand and denial - to Willie And now he too begins to sob As MARY
watches him weep she gradually releases her grip Her denial fades to be replaced by
desolation and loneliness She slowly turns to look at Willie but she quickly turns away
again unable to bear the sight and gives a piercing howl of grief

INT HAY’S OFFICE NIGHT

HAY is no longer praying or weeping Hes just sitting back in his chair staring out the
window The door opens LINCOLN enters The two men look at each other LINCOLN is
dazed-looking Uncomprehending HAY’s expression is full of love and pity

LINCOLN
Because when I go home to Springfield ’m taking my boy with me

slowly towards a waiting carriage

surrender’ The camera now reveals the writer a slight intense man with a permanent
undercurrent of anxiety in his eyes Ulysses GRANT (check rank) seated at a table
outside his headquarters tent He folds the paper he’s just written on and turns to a
Confederate MESSENGER

Your commanding officer and I were friends at West Point We fought
together in Mexico (handing over the message) With my compliments

and addicted to whisky

LINCOLN

Really Then I want you to do three things Make him a Major General
Find out what brand of whisky he drinks Send a case to every general we
got (looking up at the wall map) What’s he doing now

STANTON indicates on the map the route of Grant’s march along the Tennessee River
from Donelson

Grant says Confederate forces are concentrating at Corinth near
Memphis He aims to get there as fast as he can and force them into a
decisive engagement At the moment he’s about here

oncoming movement

EXT SBOULOH DAWN

In yet another part of the encampment breakfasting SOLDIERS look up in amazement as

incredulity on his face Then he leaps up from his unfinished breakfast grabs a box and
starts stuffing his pockets with cigars

GRANT (somewhat surprisingly a brilliant horseman possibly the best of all the Civil
War generals) rides a big powerful horse at full tilt across a chaotic battle scene
Occasionally he reigns in disregarding the missiles flying around him to focus on a
particular feature of the bautle

EXT SHERMAN’S HQ DAY
A tent General SHERMAN is outside in a frenzy of activity shouting orders at a group of
OFFICERS while scribbling and handing notes to COURIERS

SHERMAN
Tell Prentiss he must maintain his position At all costs Tell him our

be falling back on his position - and not to you listening fo me son — not
to fire at anything in blue

GRANT rides up gets off his horse handing the reins to a young ORDERLY As SOOH as
SHERMAN sees GRANT he calms profoundly reassured by Grants urbane presence

SHERMAN
Well General This is the devil I’m afraid Beauregard got us on the back
foot

GRANT lights a cigar as he speaks The odd bullet zips by and the roar of battle is close
and loud but an uncanny calm develops around GRANT as he speaks in his matter-of-fact
way

GRANT
That be has But he’s letting his forces get fragmented Which gives us
something to work with What we have to do today is stop them backing
us down to the river That’s all we can do And that’s what we must do

Donelson and Pea Ridge combined

CHASE
Neither the party nor the country has the stomach for slaughter on this
scale

BLAIR
And as for the press (reads from a newspaper) It is little wonder our
valiant troops were taken by surprise It is commonly asserted their
commanding officer had spent the preceding night in an alecholic coma
And when finally aroused General Grant was in no condition to command
an army’

SEWARD
You believe that

BLAIR
Does the public believe if is more to the point

CHASE
For your sake for the sake of the party for the survival of the Union and
the cause of freedom you must relieve General Grant of command
inmediately

into a chair Silence for a few moments

LINCOLN
For God’s sake John ask me what’s the matter
HAY
Whats the matter
LINCOLN

Stanton has just received a message from General McClellan The
General’s scouts and spies tell him he is massively outnumbered This
cannot be the case Where does he get such information He’s demanding
reinforcements of 100000 men before he will advance a yard Tt’s
ouirageous and impossible But the devil is 1 cannoé get rid of him The
army adores this man

LINCOLN shakes his head in disbelief Hes poised between laughter and rage
LINCOLN
think his numbers game is a smokescreen I think his motive for inaction

lies elsewhere What do you think John

HAY

HAY hesitates

(afier a pause togather his thoughts) Lagree about McClellan He’s clearly
looking for reasons not to fight Why J do not understand But I also think

LINCOLN
Go on John

HAY
that there’s a dangerous level of despondency in the public mind On
the one hand it cannot contemplate further losses like Grant’s at Shiloh on
the other it cannot bear that McClellan is so close to Richmond yet
unwilling to make the slightest attempt to take it The two taken together
make a paralysing brew The public could lose all will to fight And if the
Border States see that happening then

LINCOLN nods impressed

INT

LINCOLN

COMMITTEE ROOMHOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES DAY

LINCOLN is addressing several CONGRESSMEN from the Border States

Protest

LINCOLN
Gentlemen let me put it as simply and earnestly as can You must get off
the fence

LINCOLN
Your people cannot go on backing the Union with their heads and the
Confederacy with their hearts

Louder protest

LINCOLN
it’s time your people understood they cannoi remain part of a victorious
Union and hold their slaves Slav ry cannot long survive a Union victory
Nor should it

LINCOLN pauses while the hubbub dies then makes a powerful shift to the conciliatory

LINCOLN

Now gentlemen hear me out Hear me out I am proposing that the federal
government pays Delaware Maryland Kentucky and Missouri five
hundred dollars for each slave in their possession

Total silence naw

LINCOLN
provided your state legislatures enact a system of gradual
emancipation to be complete within twenty years This to give ample time
for your economies to adjust to this profound change If you accept J
believe Congress will ratify this generous proposal for the simple reason
that it will require one-third of the expenditure required to support the war
for one year I urge you by all that is reasonable and all that is just to
accept this proposal

LINCOLN looks around the room But the room is silent and unresponsive Theres a hint
of desperation in LINCOLN’s disappointed eyes Cut to

INT RECEPTION ROOMWHITE HOUSE DAY
the same look of desperation and disappointment in LINCOLN’s eves

sombre sense of occasion amongst the group LINCOLN smiles warmly without quite
effacing his unease

DOUGLASS (FROM ANOTHER ROOM)
The man bas no moral compass He’s a buckster A mere opportunist

ANNA DOUGLASS
Now I wonder who could this be your father’s talking about with such
enthusiasm

DOUGLASS enters eves glued to a newspaper
DOUGLASS

(reading) ‘The President outlined a proposal to establish a colony in
Africa or South America where freed slaves could go on 4 voluntary basis
to live independently and manage their own affairs’ The first time a
black delegation has been asked to set foot in the White House and what
does he want to talk to them about Colonization

CHARLES
(dismissively) That old chestnut never has floated and it never will
LEWIS
So long as it remains voluntary
DOUGLASS
it will Even Lincoln wouldn’t attempt mass deportation
CHARLES
He’s probably only doing it to swing the Border States
MRS DOUGLASS
So what’s wrong
DOUGLASS

What’s wrong
DOUGLASS looks at his wife outraged She looks back defiantly unimpressed

DOUGLASS
(to Lewis and Charies) Finish your breakfast And let’s get to work

‘The nation’s four million slaves are as much the natives of this country as
any of their oppressors And they have most assuredly earned 9 greater
title to citizenship than their rebel owners
INT WHITE HOUSE DAY

LINCOLN is walking through the White House reading a newspaper — Douglass’s
newspaper the ‘Douglass Monthly Special E-dition’ - as he walks We hear what he’s
reading in the powerful rhetoric of Douglasss voice broken by Lincolns pauses to look
up occasionally to see where hes going LINCOLN looks hurt and disapointed

DOUGLASS (VO)
The tone of frankness and benevolence which the President assumed in his
specch to the colored committee is too thin a mask not to be seen through
The genuine spark of humanity is missing in it no sincere wish to improve
the condition of the oppressed has dictated it It expresses merely the
desire to get rid of them and

LINCOLN enters his office

INT LINCOLN’S OFFICE DAY
LINCOLN stands by his desk reading the newspaper to HAY

LINCOLN
‘ its only practical effect will be to furnish a weapon to all the ignorant
and base who will interpret such a rejection by the highest authority-in the
land as license to commit all kinds of violence and outrage on the black
community — on the grounds that if they will not go away voluntarily then
they must be driven away cleansed from the land’

LINCOLN stops reading

LINCOLN
Now that is a profound argument

He drops the newspaper on his desk He looks at HA Y deep in thought for several
moments Then he turns and looks out of the window

INT WHITE HOUSE RECEPTION ROOM DAY

recognise from the earlier scene when Lincoln made his plea for compensated

emancipation waits silently even guiltily

INT LINCOLN’S OFFICE DAY
LINCOLN looks desolately at the delegation of CONGRESSMEN

LINCOLN
Gentlemen I implore you to reconsider I made the proposal of
compensated emancipation for one reason above all Because I believe it
will shorten the war and save many lives The terms are generous In
addition I’ve attempted to promote colonisation — to help assuage your
people’s fears of what might follow emancipation (pause an edge of
bitterness) can do no more

We move through an abundance of cultivated lowers in a large conservatory to discover

MARY dressed in black simply standing and looking around in a vacant way A few
moments later LINCOLN appears at her side Silence Then

MARY
He was the only little boy I ever knew who loved flowers

Silence The look of hopelessness of neediness in LINCOLN’s eyes is so marked it
penetrates even MARY’s preoccupation

EXT ARWEL AFTERNOON

On a covered lower deck some SAILORS are holding a contest of strength who can hold
an axe at arms length the longest A powerful-looking SAILOR is sweuting it out
shaking with the effort axe beginning to waver more and more while a PETTY
OFFICER times him

PETTY OFFICER
Three minutes

The SAILOR keeps it going for another Jew seconds then with a great gasp of relief
lowers the axe

The boat is moored alongside a jetty LINCOLN sits on the rear deck alone serious but
relaxed looking at the evening light on the river and thinking Behind him all along the

banks of ihe river is the Army of the Potomac’s vast encampment A few feet from Lincoln
is a single empty chair

A litile distance beyond Lincoln we see a gang of black LABOURERS slouch
dispiritedly onto a neighbouring jetty The Labourers are accompanied by a bad-
tempered white CORPORAL

CORPORAL
Come on Move yourselves Or get back to your plantations you lazy
bastards

Cui to LINCOLN watching the Corporal and the Labourers Cut back to the
LABOURERS standing before a small cargo boat staring at LINCOLN

CORPORAL
(threateningly) What the hell ’you think

Now the CORPORAL sees Lincoln He too is struck into silence — one which resonates
with resentment This man we guess is not fighting for emancipation The CORPORAL
not knowing what else to do salutes Lincoln LINCOLN nods and fixes the CORPORAL
in a thoughtful stare The CORPORAL is uncertain guilty thinking Lincoln may be about
to say something But it’s not Lincoln who speaks

LABOURER
Marse Lincoln That you

LINCOLN releases the CORPORAL from his powerful gaze and turns to the LAROURER
a strong-looking man who isn’t humbled or over-awed but simply delighted by the fact
that Abraham Lincoln is sitting few yards away from him

LINCOLN
Yes Except Pm not your master Merely your President

A moment between LINCOLN and the LABOURER who knows exactly what Lincoln is
saying The LABOURER ’s eyes glow with appreciation Then the LABOURER suddenly
grins and turns to the other LABOURERS

LABOURER
What you all staring at Let’s give President Lincoln some respect and
some privacy (with a pointedly dismissive look at the Corporal) And lets
gel this boat unloaded

The LABOURER jumps aboard the cargo bout followed hy the other LABOURERS
grinning from ear to ear

EXT JETTY EVENING
McCLELLAN and his two AIDES clatter onto the jetty

EXT ARIEL EVENING

LINCOLN gets to his feet as MCCLELLAN appears flanked by his AIDES Immediately it
can be seen by McCLELLAN’s expression that this is not so much a meeting as a
confrontation The AIDES clearly share that idea They salute coldly LINCOLN smiles

LINCOLN

Welcome aboard General Please sit down

MeCLELLAN sits

LINCOLN

Thope you’re not inconvenienced by the spontaneity of my visit

McCLELLAN

Not at ail

LINCOLN

I simply felt the strong desire to sit down with you and have a discussion
The two of us

LINCOLN glances up at the AIDES who give no sign of taking the hint and return
Lincolns amiable expression with cold arrogance making the point that they take their
hints only from the General McCLELLAN gives a moment or two for the point to sink in

McCLELLAN
Gentlemen If you wouldn’t mind

The two AIDES salute McClellan smartly ignoring Lincoln and go Silence fora
moment or two

LINCOLN
How are the troops General

McCLELLAN
Disappointed They had hoped to be in Richmond by now

LINCOLN
‘The entire country is disappointed on that accent General
McCLELLAN

The country has no right to be disappointed (pause) But those men have
every right to be disappointed in their country
LINCOLN tenses a little This is an extraordinary thing Jor general to say - for ‘their
country’ read ‘their commander-in-chief’

LINCOLN
Tm not sure understand

McCLELLAN
Then with your permission sir I will explain Those men face vastly
superior numbers and equipment And as their commanding officer I
cannot gamble against such odds with their lives and will not until ‘their
country’ provides them with the resources they need (pause) But there is
also another and deeper source of discontent (pause) My men believe
radicals and emancipationists are gaining control of your administration
That the war my men volunteered to fight - the war to defeat a rebellion —
is being turned into a war to deprive the slave owner of his property This
is the heart of their disappointment This the heart of their growing
disaffection I flatter myself their loyalty to me and my power to
command them is undimmed But - I tell you plainly sir - this army will
not fight for the negro

Silence The implicit threat is clear The two men hold each other in an even stare T here
is no possibility of further discussion

INT DINING TENT NIGHT

LINCOLN is dining in some style with McCLELLAN and his resplendant OFFICER
CORPS in a spacious lined and floor-boarded tent There is a sense not only of
McCLELLAN’s hostility but of LINCOLN’s thoughtful detachment from his
surroundings HAY watches Lincoln observing his dignified isolation

EXT HOOLILSIDE NIGHT
LINCOLN and HAY have walked to the top of a hill Beneath them is an extraordinary
sight the lamps and fires of the vasy Army of the Potomac stretching for miles

LINCOLN
John tell me what is that we see below us

HAY
The Grand Army of the Potomac

LINCOLN
No Jobn That is General MeClellan’s personal bodyguard

LINCOLN turns and looks at HAY for a long moment

LINCOLN
All my life Pve believed that given time most people will see what’s right
and act accordingly Which is why I’m a patient and compromising man
But these are uncertain times My son is dead My wife is nearly insane
with grief And that army down there rather than defend the best form of
popular goverment the world has ever seen may choose instead to turn
the United States into a military dictatorship (pause) Uncertain times
John Which is more foolish therefore — to act in haste or to wait for the
right moment (pause) m grateful to McClellan for providing me with
the answer

the boat striking out against the gentle current his body surprisingly elegant and

INT LINCOLN’S OFFICE NIGHT

JIMMY sits at Lincoln’s desk reading with rapt attention Hes holding the Proclamation

INT WHITE HOUSE DAY

LINCOLN strides along a corridor and then up a flight of stairs holding a few sheets of

LINCOLN reads to the CABINET
LINCOLN
all persons held as slaves shall be then and thenceforward forever

free

Everyone in the room looks stunned Then mixed ractions begin to shaw themselves on
the faces af the CABINET The CABINE gather their thoughts First off the mark is
Chase

CHASE
premature Dangerously premature Emancipation as a declared
war-aim is one thing As a great and glorious prize of victory But this
this will create depredation and massacre actoss the Confederacy It
reduces a noble cause to a vicious and contemptible act of spite which

could seriously damage our cause - and bring international support to the
Confederacy

LINCOLN stays silent and shows no reaction

BLAIR
Mr President you have never unlike Mr Chase underestimated the
strength of racist feeling in the North With this measure you’re doing
exactly that Not only could we lose the Border States but we risk a
backlash across the country And for what To announce the freedom of
slaves that are beyond your powers to free Fora Proclamation made on
the grounds of military necessity which will make no difference to a single
slave in the Confederacy while having no effect whatsoever on the
Confederacy’s ability to wage war

LINCOLN shows no reaction Neither Chase nor Blair has said anything which Lincoin
hasnt already considered

SEWARD
(cautiously) 1 approve —

STANTON
So do I

SEWARD

approve In principle But I question the wisdom of its issue at this
juncture In our current situation it could be seen as the last desperate
measure of an exhausted government on the road to defeat (pause) Mr

President I think you should delay Until we have a military victory
SEWARD looks at Lincoln now with powerful empathy
SEWARD

This is too profound a measure for it to be said ‘He only did it because
he was losing the war’

LINCOLNs expression gradually changes now — from imperturbable certain
disappointment and finally to acceptance This is the one objection he hada’t
anticipated And he sees its wisdom unre ervedly

fo deep

He begins to weep

MARY
Ob dearest Dearest Join me Youll see

LINCOLNs grief suddenly becomes intense anger He seizes MARY violently — an
unprecedented act which shocks her to the core and pulls her towards a window

LINCOLN
‘You see that light The one on top of the hill Do you know what that
place is

She’s speechless with shock and fear

LINCOLN
(shouts) Do you know what that place is
MARY
No No
LINCOLN

LINCOLN holds her head to the window virtually shoving her face against it

LINCOLN
Look at it Think about that place Because Mary if you don’t stop all this
if you don’t come back to us — to me and Tad - m aftaid very afraid
that T will put you inside it

LINCOLN is trembling with rage MARY is trembling on the edge of collapse She looks
very frail — she’s been eaten away hy grief - and more vulnerable at this moment than
he’s ever seen her LINCOLN closes his eyes in despair and misery He turns MARY
towards him and folds his arms around her For some moments it looks as if they ‘ve
found each other — then suddenly she pushes away from him and rushes to the door
pausing to give him a look of fear and loathing before she slams if shut He stares at the
door drained of all emotion except a crushing sense of isolation

The light begins to drain from LINCOLN’ eyes

LINCOLN
They say we lost twelve thousand

She looks at him as if there’s something about him she finds deeply puzzling Then her
expression hardens

MARY
Twelve thousand

LINCOLN
MARY
And the Confederates - even more presumably

LINCOLN
(grim humour) Not necessarily Not with our Generals

Silence He goes to her and gently takes her Jace in his hands like something
indescribably fragile

LINCOLN
Mary I should go need to —

LINCOLN goes on holding Mary’s face looking into her eyes which are angry and
challenging LINCOLN looks deeply uncertain He hasn’t been here before and he cant
read the signs

LINCOLN
icare Mary We both do

MARY
No

MARY takes Lincolus’ hands from her face lowering them and releasing them as she
turns away to the window

MARY
This entire country is drowning in blood But all the pain feel is for
Willie No-one else

LINCOLN
Mary I know your nature Your pain is for all of them That’s why it’s so
great
MARY
(sudden intensity) No
MARY turns on him
MARY

You maybe My pain is all for ary son
LINCOLN nods sadly patiently understandingly

MARY
Don’t give me that understanding look Because you don’t Because
there’s a difference between you and me (pause) You know what that is
The real deep-down honest-to-God difference

LA
LINCOLN
No Mother Tell me

MARY
No matter how terrible the loss you always find some great work to bury
it under Some great cause Some great disaster Some great victory

LINCOLN gazes at her struck by the truth of her claim
MARY
The difference is never can There is nothing for me - but to endure

Thats how it is with me (pause) With us

A long painful moment LINCOLN is shocked by Marys anger but more much more
by her sense of isolation

LINCOLN
Have I done so little for you Do you really feel so alone

Their eyes meet and hold

INT LINCOLN’S OFFICE DAY
LINCOLN and DOUGLASS shake hands

LINCOLN
Im glad to see you Mr Douglass I hope you weren’t kept waiting

DOUGLASS
(allows him the slightest smile) No l wasw’t

LINCOLN
Good Now tell me what’s on your mind

LINCOLN smiles and moves away a few paces towards the window DO UGLASS stands
agitated and hesttant for a moment then comes at it head on

DOUGLASS

Do you regard black soldiers in your army as less valuable than white
soldiers

LINCOLN turns to face Douglass

LINCOLN
After their valour at Milliken’s Bend Port Hudson Fort Wagner No
Certainly not
DOUGLASS

Then why don’t they receive equal pay And why do you allow them to be
murdered with impunity when captured There are so many inequalities
but these two will suffice for the moment

LINCOLN
Then I can offer some reassurance A substantial increase in pay will be
announced next weel

DOUGLASS
(barely missing a beat) A ‘substantial increase’ To what Three-quarter
manhood Seven-eighths equality (pause) Mr Lincoln men urged with
all my heart to enlist enlisted in the Massachusetts regiments under the
promise from your War Department of equal pay

LINCOLN
Mr Douglass I can only ask for your patience These things are subject to
law and public opinion Changes in either can only be achieved in the
fullness of time

DOUGLASS
That’s what you said about emancipation But when you found the will
you found the way

LINCOEN barely reacts but his expression intensifies just enough to show he’s struck by
the insight in Douglasss remark He sits down in his desk chair giving the floor to
Douglass LINCOLN is intellectually engaged now in that calin fearless way of his

LINCOLN
That’s true That is very true But if I’d made that proclamation just six
months earlier neither the country nor the army would have stood for if 1
would have been lost

DOUGLASS
You can talk all you wish of political expediency

LINCOLN
Imperatives Mr Douglass fmperatives

DOUGLASS
There are no political imperatives Only moral imperatives What is right
and what is wrong (pause) Mr Lincoln Surely you’re not going to tell me
that political expediency accounts for your silence when prisoners of war
from your army are being murdered

LINCOLN
No

LINCOLN turns to his desk and picks out a document

LINCOLN
This is the draft of a Retaliatory Order Which I will sign as soon as it has
been properly drawn up (he reads) “the law of nations and the usages and
the customs of war permit no distinction as to race in the treatment of
prisoners of war for every soldier of the United States killed in
violation of the laws of war a rebel soldier will be executed and for every
one enslaved a rebel soldier will be placed at hard labour’

LINCOLN drops the document on the desk and looks at Douglass who though he’s had
the wind taken out of his sails shows only relief and approval

DOUGLASS
That sir is well done Very well done

LINCOLN
You think it’s right

DOUGLASS pauses understanding the weight of the question His answer is a
considered one

DOUGLASS
ido

LINCOLN
I think is wrong Show me the rebel who executed the prisoner and 1 will
sign bis death w t But this (picks up the proclamation as if weighing
it) is budiscriminate retaliation Once begun where does it end This is
stepping out on the slope to barbarisrn

LINCOLN puis the document down
p

A pause

DOUGLASS
(impatient challenging) Then why are you going to sign it
LINCOLN
Political expediency

LINCOEN stares at DOUGLASS looking for understanding

LINCOLN
I believe the recruitment of any black troops at all has been a major
achievernent I believe unequal pay was a necessary concession to smooth
the way Right or wrong I can only promise you in time they will receive
equal pay Paid retrospectively from the day they enlisted I may err too
much on the side of caution Mr Douglass am certainly slow But once
embarked on a course J try hard to keep to it

Brief silence

DOUGLASS
Does that include your course towards colonization

Brief silence They both know that was a little below the belt But LINCOLN’s expression
reads ‘Alright Fair enough’

LINCOLN
No I finally saw the limitations even the absurdity of that idea
(pause) God knows I am not a perfect man Mr Douglass

The two men look into each other’s eyes for a long moment
LINCOLN
I will do my best to correct the present injustices suffered by black
soldiers The Union needs them Not only because they fight and die as

well as any other but because it’s essential they have a part in the struggle

DOUGLASS
TL understand that Better than you

LINCOLN realises he’s being patronising gives a Httle smile of ackowledgement and
apology

LINCGLN
Yes Which is why need your support (pause) Aud your friendship

4A long silence Finally decisively

DOUGLASS

Pll give you my support Mr Lincoln Because I’ve witnessed your
humanity your sincerity - and your terrible weariness

DOUGLASS steps closer to LINCOLN and looks into his eyes DOUGLASS radiates an
imposing fierce kindliness

DOUGLASS
But if we’re to win this war you must find the strength - and the will - to
fight it with a passion as a noble cause as an enterprise of moral
grandeur (pause) And 1 will not be your friend until you do

LINCOEN nods his acceptance of this DOUGLASS looks at Lincoin for a moment or
two gives him a respectful nod then turns to leave LINCOLN thinks for a moment then
goes to his desk He begins a letter

EXT PONTOON BRIDGE NIGHT

A bright mooa amidst broken cloud above shifting mist below on the river where
ENGINEERS are working feverishly to build a pontoon bridge Occasionally theres a
distant shot and the whine of a bullet fired more in hope than belief and pretty much
ignored by the ENGINEERS Suddenly they pause and tense as the mist clears and the
moor comes out Immediately accurate rifle fire comes at them rom the town One of the
ENGINEERS at the head of the pontoon is killed instantly and falis into the river
Another is wounded Hes gathered up in the hasty retreat back to the bank and cover
where laid out in a row ore about twenty dead ENGINEERS The ryiving ENGINEERS
stand around in indescribable tension waiting for the moon to di pear and the mist to
reform around the pontoon

superhuman workrate and lack of sleep have been increasingly evident on Lincoin’s face

defensively erect and even arrogant

LINCOLN
General I wanted to add something to my public statements of admiration
and deeply-felt gratitude for your historic victory

MEADE smelling something other than more congratulations makes no response
LINCO

Genoral Meade We lost twenty-three thousand men in that struggle
‘Twenty-three thousand What was their achievernent

MEATIE
To drive the invader from our soil For ever

LINCOLN looks at MEADE for a moment with unspeakable weariness Then he turns to
amap of America

LINCOLN
So Lee and his army are nowhere to be found on this map (pause) When
will the officers of Army of the Potomac understand The whole country
is ‘our soil’ (pause trying but failing to cool down) General those men
died so that men could be free and this great country made whole again

LINCOLN ’s expression sofiens — before the weariness and frustration get the better of
him once again

LINCOLN
Why did you pursue Lee’s army with such lack of purpose Why did you
mot attack before he could cross the Potomac

MEADE
Sir Taking into account all proper caution against counter-attack I
pursued General Lee’s army with vigour

Suddenly LINCOLN flares into anger But this is the anger of a man too exhausted for
rage LINCOLN subsides into coldness — something we have never witnessed in him
before

LINCOLN
‘Vigour’ You know what your pursuit of the Army of Northern Virginia
reminded me of

ADE
No

weariness and sadness) But lam so deeply deeply sick of the waste of so
many men’s lives

theyre hungry skinny but their morale is amazingly high they’re singing The
SOLDIERS respond to Lee in various ways some with just a smile some with a cheer of
Sreeting and exclamations of ‘Gen’ral’ or ‘Fine day Marse Robert Fine day’ Theres
an intimacy about this And there’s an intensity too it’s the passionate semi-mystical
devotion the great general can inspire in his seldiers

LINCOLN is on his feet about to speak He holds a small piece of paper in his hand
which he only glances at from time to time as if he had abandoned the speech in his
hand and decided to speak spontaneously and directly from the heart

LINCOLN
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent
a new nation conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition that
all men are created equal Now we are engaged in a great civil war testing
whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long
endure We are met on a great battlefield of that war We have come to
dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here
gave their lives that that nation might live It is altogether fitting and
proper that we should do this But in a larger sense we can not dedicate —
we can not hallow — this ground The brave men living and dead who
struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or
detract The world will little note nor long remember what we say here
but it can never forget what they did here It is for us the living rather to
be dedicated to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus
far so nobly advanced Jt is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great
task remaining before us — that from these honoured dead we take
increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure
of devotion — that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have
died in vain — that this nation under God shall have a new birth of
freedom — and that government of the people by the people for the
people shall not perish from the earth

As the last five words ring out joy and profound admiration burst through DOUGLASS’s
rapt expression

He reads on finishes folds the newspaper and watks on down the steps radiant with a
joyous certainty

INT WILLARDS HOTEL DAY

In the lobby GRANT stands before a DESK CLERK — who fails to recognise the non-

his worn old uniform is even dirtier than normal )

MANAGER
General Grant my desk clerk has made a quite ridiculous bhinder We

GRANT
That won’t be necessary
MANAGER
But why General Because you are in some way offended
GRANT

No Because your desk clerk doesn’t strike me as the blundering kind
And I suspect that suite will belong by rights to someone else Which
suspicion will make me less comfortable on that bed than on this

GRANT settles back on the bed and smokes

For a moment DOUGLASS stares at LINCOLN

DOUGLASS
You Mr President are a true original You never cease to surprise

those places know nothing of the emancipation Step one is to send in
agents to spread the word

me on this

LINCOLN puts a hand on Douglasss shoulder and leans towards him

LINCOLN

DOUGLASS smiles flattered to be asked yet somehow reluctant to answer seems he
doesnt want to embarrass Lincoln with his disapproval particularly as all around him
are waiting for his answer

DOUGLASS
Sir on this great occasion my opinion is scarcely of importance

LINCOLN looks at Douglass for a moment

LINCOLN
Mr Douglass There is no man in the country whose opinion value more
DOUGLASS knows Lincoln is utterly sincere A long silence between these two
extraordinary men at the centre of the crowd of America in fact a silence which
resonates with mutual recognition and respect

EXT WASHINGTONINAUGURAL PODIUM DAY
the same golden yellow light bathes LINCOLN in an extraordinary radiance as he begins
his Second Inaugural speech

LINCOLN
On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago all thoughts were
directed to an impending civil-war Both parties deprecated war but
one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the
other would accept war rather than let if perish And the war came

EXT RUINS OF RICHMOND DAY
LINCOLN and his COMPANIONS ride slowly into the deserted ruins of Richmond
LINCOLN is appalled by the extent of the devastation

LINCOLN (VO)
Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which
it has already attained Each looked for an easier triumph and a result
less fundamental and astounding

From the shadows emerge EX-SLAVES slowly fearfully barely able to believe that this
unmistakable figure is actually Abraham Lincoln While the rest of his party stay
mounted LINCOEN dismounts and leads his horse amongst the silent EX-SLAVES
reaching out to touch their extended hands

EXT McCLEAN HOUSE DAY
LEE very sombre but splendidly dignified in full dress uniform comes out onto the porch
of a small wood-built house

LINCOLN (VO)
Both read the same Bible and pray to the same God and each invokes his
aid against the other

As LEE walks down the few steps to mount his horse the scruffy figure of GRANT
emerges onto the porch followed by a number of other UNION OFFICERS LEF mounts
Traveller then turas to Grant and raises his hat GRANT raises his in return We pull bak
to show the house is surrounded by a host of Union OF FICERS and SOLDIERS many
deeply moved all of whom are taking off their hats

ROAD FROM MeCLEAN HOUSE DAY
RE vides slowly along a road lined with CONFEDERATE TROOPS boys and old men
amongst them Their condition is shocking — half-starved uniforms virtually in rags but
these are not beaten men Their proud body-language and expressions of bitter
disappointment leave no doubt they would fight on and fight fiercely

LINCOLN (VO
The prayers of both could not be answered that of neither has been
answered fully

LEE cannot bear to look any of them in the eye as they begin to move forward many
sobbing now to stroke Traveller or touch LEE’s boots

LINCOLN (VO)
Fondly do we hope — fervently do we pray —

EXT WASIINGTONAINAUGURAL PODIUM DAY
Were back in the Second Inaugural and the speech

LINCOLN
that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away

LINCOLN pauses before delivering the final paragraph of his speech

LINCOLN
With malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right
as God gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are
in to bind up the nation’s wounds to care for him who shall have borne
the battle and for his widow and his orphan — to do all which may
achieve and cherish a just and a lasting peace among ourselves and with
all nations

A brief silence As we pull away applause not of celebration but of passionate approval
rolls like an ocean beneath us and we see for the first time the newly-completed
Capitol dome gleaming white against black clouds as it grows into the frame to tower
majestically over the multitude of Americans and over Lincoln the small brilliant figure
at their heart
