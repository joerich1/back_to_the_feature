INT PHIL KAUFMANS BEDROOM NIGHT

A phone rings in the dark A little light falls from the
open window illuminating an old bakelite telephone It
sits on a small table alongside a large amount of empty
bottles and a couple of overflowing ashtrays

EXT PHILS TRIKE NIGHT

A three wheeled motorcycle is being driven through the
night at great speed The trike is moving very quickly
its headlights cutting through the darkness its wheels
sending a spray of sand flying towards us as the driver
fights to keep it on the road This is PHIL KAUFMAN and
hes in a hurry

INT JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8 NIGHT

Two figures are struggling on the floor The male is
naked The woman sits astride him her movements urgent
her breath fast They appear to be having sex

EXT TRIKE DAWN
The Trike cuts through the night and we pull back to show
desert more desert and then a giant bright flickering

neon sign Welcome to the Joshua Tree Inn

INT PHIL KAUFMANS BEDROOM NIGHT
That phone - still ringing shrill insistent There is a
bed next to the table It is covered in clothes but there
is also a mans shape which now moves

INT JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8 NIGHT

A little more light and it now appears as if our man and
woman are struggling There is fear on her face

INT PHIL KAUFMANS BEDROOM NIGHT

Still that insistent ringing and the covers suddenly fly
off the bed We see the man from behind as he shakes the
sleep away and looks for the damn phone

INT JOSHUA TREE INN - ROOM 8 NIGHT

The woman is screaming now and banging on the mans chest
with her fists He is motionless underneath her

EXT OUTSIDE JOSHUA TREE INN DAWN

The Trike skids to a halt amid a cloud of dust and the
driver leaps off He runs at the door throwing it open in
one movement disappearing into the room A broken striped
No Entry - Police band flutters to the ground

INT PHIL KAUFMANS BEDROOM NIGHT

The man finally answers the phone At last the ringing
stops
PHIL

She looks carefully at the pyjamas which peek out from
under the shabby overcoat His hair is on end He is
wearing biker boots and is holding an unlit but half-smoked
cigar

NURSE

She turns away

PHIL

Which makes two of us

The nurse turns and marches down the corridor Phil waits
until shes gone and then walks through a door marked
Admittance only to Authorized Hospital Staff

checking signs He pushes open a door marked Pathology

INT HOSPITAL PATHOLOGY LAB MORNING
The room is empty except for a couple of covered bodies on

trolleys Phil checks under the first sheet and recoils
at whatever it is which lies beneath
PHIL
Sheesh

He walks over to the next gurney and lifts the sheet He
stares down at the body visibly moved

PHIL (CONTD)

He stands for a moment gripping the gurney and looking
down at his friend Then he snaps out of it

PHIL (CONTD)

sight
EXT DESERT MORNING
Phils trike accelerates as it approaches a T junction
To

the right the sign points to Joshua Tree Town to the

skids left sending a spray of sand and gravel flying
across the road

NB There will be several shots of Phil driving through
the desert set to music

EXT PHILS STREET DAY

The Trike pulls up outside a rambling old house Two
enormous plaster eagles flank the front door a giant
Harley Davidson sign hangs from the roof and theres a six
foot flashing neon star in the front window Phil gets

out walks up to the door and pulls some keys out of his
pocket

INT PHILS SITTING ROOM DAY

Phil walks into the room and pours himself a drink He
slumps onto the couch takes a sip and closes his eyes We
see movement behind him as an attractive girl slips
through a door and approaches Phil from behind This is
SUSIE and she puts her hands over his eyes

SUSIE
Guess who

PHIL
Martin Luther King

SUSIE
Try again
Susie leans over the back of the chair and gives Phil a
long slow kiss She jumps over the couch and resumes
kissing this time more passionately Phil tries to pull
away with little success

PHIL
This isnt the
best time Baby

Susie continues regardless Phil is now finding it hard to
resist He eventually gives in and they begin to kiss
passionately

INT PHILS KITCHEN DAY

Phil and Susie are sitting at the kitchen table He takes
a drag from her cigarette and passes it back
SUSIE
God damn Im so sorry baby

PHIL

PHIL (CONTD)
How long this time Two weeks

SUSIE

Susie disappears through the door Phils shoulders sag
and he slumps against the wall Then Susie reappears with
a bottle of Jack Daniels and a couple of glasses She
pours out two generous measures and hands one to Phil

SUSIE
Come here

After a moment he gets up and follows her out of the room
INT PHILS SITTING ROOM DAY
Susie guides Phil to a chair and sits him down

PHIL

SUSIE
This is a remembrance

She crosses to a record player and turns it on pausing to
let down the blind on the way back In My Hour of

Darkness(or similar music) fills the room

SERIES OF
SHOTS

GIRL
(Earnestly)
He was so beautiful and he
understood what my heart was
feeling Ill
(MOR E)

CON TINUE D
GIR L (CONTD)
never laugh again My inner joy
has gone It evaporated when
Gram departed

C) MUSIC EXPERT ON CHAT SHOW

EXPERT
He sang country music in a way
that it had never been sung

if you like And it was kinda
catchy At least the young
people seemed to lap it up Its
fair to say that when Gram
Parsons died he died a star

D) PHIL TAKES ANOTHER DRINK HE MAY BE CRYING
E) HIPPIE TO CAM FROM A STREET IN LA

HIPPIE
Its like I cant It was
real kinda I Oh man

F) PHIL SLEEPS AND THE GLASS SLIPS FROM HIS HAND
G) REPORTER TO CAM FROM OUTSIDE JOSHUA TREE HOSPITAL

REPORTER
And another light burns out in
the desert Gram Parsons - the
standard bearer of the new
country music movement - is dead
following an overdose of drugs
While many of Americas young
people are today in mourning
their parents will view this as
another example of how todays
drug culture can so easily claim
a life Well leave you tonight
with the young mans own words
Gram Parsons wrote a song called
In My Hour of Darkness which
contains these words In my hour
of darkness

We are back in Phils sitting room Fade up on the music
to match the reporters words as Grams voice fills the
room (or similar music)

GRAMS VOICE
In my hour of darkness in my
time of need Oh Lord grant me
vision Oh Lord grant me speed
Oh Lord grant me vision Oh Lord
grant me speed

CON TINUE D

Susie tenderly throws a blanket over the sleeping Phil as

dark

INT PHILS SITTING ROOM DAY

Susie walks in with a coffee She sits beside Phil and
strokes his head until he wakes She kisses him and passes
him the cup

PHIL
Hello

SUSIE

Hi
He sits up and stretches She leans over to kiss him then
stands and starts to tidy He watches her She picks up
some clothing from near his chair and moves away He drops
another piece of clothing on the same spot She says
nothing and picks it up He takes a sock off and drops it
It has stopped being a game and started being a statement
She picks the sock up and drops it in his lap He pushes
it back onto the floor She opens her arms and everything
falls to the floor She walks out of the room and into the
kitchen He follows

INT PHILS KITCHEN DAY

Susie leans on the table staring out of the window Phil
walks up behind her

PHIL
When youre here I spend my time
wondering when youre going And
when youre back I wonder where

She turns and walks round to face him

CON TINUE D

SUSIE

shoes twice a week and buys his
ties in bulk because it works out
cheaper that way Ill put you
in touch

SUSIE
I dont mind loving a crazy
bastard Phil But youve got to
be for something and not just
against everything You have to
choose something to represent

PHIL
I represent the combined forces
of charm enchantment and
exuberance

SUSIE
Your job is to arrange other
peoples lives Maybe its time
to put a little thought into your
own

Susie walks out of the room

EXT SUBURBAN STREET DAY

A suburban street of small neat bungalows We move down
the street past house and identical house until we rest
outside another that is identical to the rest The front
door opens and a nondescript man emerges carrying a small
overnight bag He carefully locks the door and walks down
the path to where a cab waits We can clearly see New
Orleans Taxi marked on the door

MAN
Airport please

This is STANLEY PARSONS Grams father

She reads it out

BARBARA (CONTD)
To whom it may concern I would

wish to leave Barbara Mansfield

event of my death Signed
Ingram Cecil Parsons

Phil looks surprised

PHIL
Did he write that with joined up
writing or was it before he knew
how

Barbara gives a wry smile

BARBARA
Still the jester Kaufman and
still very unfunny

PHIL
Thats not a will Barbara and
you know it

BARBARA
Its better than a will

from Gram to leave me all his
assets and belongings And

Barbara pushes past Phil who gives no resistance She
walks straight over to the couch and starts pulling up the
cushions Susie moves to stop her but Phil holds her back
and lets Barbara carry on
INT PHILS LOUNGE DAY

Phil and Susie sit on the sofa an island of calm in a sea
of chaos Around them the floor is covered with papers
clothing empty record covers torn open cushions and
books A broken drawer is propped against the table A
lampshade hangs crazily from its bearings throwing strange
shadows around the room Suddenly Susie gets up and kicks
a cushion across the room

PHIL
Hey well done You found the
only unbroken thing

SUSIE
Why did you let her in

PHIL
Its all part of the grieving
process

SUSIE

INT LARRY OSTERBERGS HOME DAY

A man is sitting cross-legged on the floor A joss stick
burns beside him and sitar music plays in the background
This is LARRY OSTERBERG and he is meditating There is a
loud hammering on the door Larry shows no sign of having
heard anything More hammering at the door but still no
response Then the letter box creaks open and an eye
appears in the slot After a moment the eye disappears
and Phils face appears momentarily at the window The
window seems to be slightly higher than Phil so his face
appears every time he jumps up to peer into the room

PHIL
(OS)
Hello Anyone there
Then Phil is gone Larry expels a big breath The
letterbox creaks opens again and the eye is back

PHIL (CONTD)
(OS)

which he opens

LARRY
The door is unlocked

Phil barrels in and closes the door behind him He turns
to take a look around the room
PHIL

strides down the sidewalk and as a group of schoolchildren
appears around the corner Barbara scatters left and right

CON TINUE D
Then she cuts across the road and a delivery van skids to
a halt inches away horn blaring The driver leans out of
the window furious

DRIVER
Hey lady

Barbara stops and whips round her hair cascading across
her shoulders her blue eyes flashing The man simply
stares at her enchanted by her beauty

BARBARA
Yes

He continues to stare and is only shaken back to his
senses by a burst of abuse from further back in the road

DRIVER
You should be careful

Barbara smiles

INT HEARSE DAY
Larry drives and talks Phil looks tense

LARRY
See the Yin is the negative -
the darkside And the Yang
represents positive - good If
you like the first is earth and
the second heaven

DISSOLVE

INT HEARSE DAY - A LITTLE LATER
Larry still talks Phil now looks bored

LARRY
The Yin Yang symbol is really
evocative about the whole
concept As you travel around
the circle white or black will
increase until the opposite color
is almost gone But never
totally gone right And this
cycle then repeats for the
opposite color

DISSOLVE

INT HEARSE DAY - A LITTLE LATER

Larry still talks glancing across to Phil to make his
point every now and then Phil is tossing a cigarette into
the air and trying to catch it between his teeth

LARRY
What seems like Yin is often
supported by Yang and vice
versa Let me give you an
example To truly know good you
must first know evil and without
good as a comparison nothing can
be evil So by allowing Yin to
flourish you welcome Yan By
letting go of Yin you are
waiting for its return Another
example is

There is a crash and the car slams to a halt Larry is
thrown forward but manages to grab the wheel Phil is not
so lucky and catapults into the dashboard before being
thrown back into his seat the crumpled cigarette still
gripped between his teeth

EXT HIGHWAY DAY

Bernice has driven into a road sign set into a concrete
pillar In fact the sign that Bernice has driven into is
the only thing anywhere near the road for miles in any
direction

INT HEARSE DAY

Phil is dazed He checks his forehead which is bleeding
Then he gazes out at the desolate road and the solitary
buckled sign

PHIL
It would be really nice if we
could get through a couple of

hours without crashing the car

LARRY
I was distracted

Phil looks out of the window at the vast expanse of nothing
but desert

PHIL
Of course you were

CON TINUE D

There is a faint noise Larry hears it first and then Phil
and then as they strain to identify it they see a tiny
dot on the road ahead of them which grows and grows as
they watch it and they peer hard into the wind to identify
it and its a motorcycle cop

PHIL (CONTD)
I dont believe it Middle of
nowhere and quick - stand in
front of the car

EXT HIGHWAY DAY

They jump out of the car and shuffle sideways until they
are standing in front of the actual point of collision
LARRY
What now

PHIL
Pretend were having a
conversation

The buckled sign hangs dangerously above them as they both
grin at the approaching policeman in a friendly manner

LARRY
Okay What about

PHIL
I dont know what about Ever

Yabba yabba yabba every waking
minute Religion your

The cop slows down but drives past Phil waves at

The cop does a

PHIL (CONTD)
Whatever your damn fool religion
is called I think it works

LARRY
Well its more a philosophy
than a religion

U-turn and motors towards them

PHIL
Oh well done Good work

He shoots a vicious look at Larry The cop parks his

and removes his helmet

CON TINUE D

As he opens his mouth to speak a headlight falls off the
car and rolls off the road They all watch it go

The sign gives

MOTORCYCLE COP

PHIL

step out of danger

MOTORCYCLE COP
Oh its going fine thank you
How are things with you

PHIL
Fine fine We just stopped
to take a look at

He waves his arm at the desert

PHIL (CONTD)

got around here

The cop takes his sunglasses off and takes a look around
as if its the first time hes seen it

MOTORCYCLE COP
Well it is mighty nice around
these parts If you like desert

They all look appreciatively at the desert and the cop
glances down at the keys in Larrys hand
MOTORCYCLE COP (CONTD)
(to Larry)
And how are things with you
today sir

Larry looks flustered

LARRY
Ooooh Im well Really well
actually Thank you

The cop doesnt respond just keeps looking at Larry with a
pleasant half-smile on his face

MOTORCYCLE COP
The reason I ask is that you
appear to have driven into one of
our road signs

CON TINUE D Larry turns and appears to see the huge buckled pole for
the first time

LARRY
Oh

MOTORCYCLE COP
Im surprised that you hadnt
noticed earlier as it does
appear to be impeding your
forward progress

Phil starts to laugh
PHIL
Thats a great line

The cop turns to Phil He is still smiling

MOTORCYCLE COP
Thank you

A long pause Then
MOTORCYCLE COP (CONTD)
I wonder if you gentlemen can
help me

PHIL
Anything

MOTORCYCLE COP
Im looking for some fellows who
stole a body back there at the
airport
Larry wobbles with shock

LARRY
A body Stole a body

MOTORCYCLE COP
A body Rather like the one in
the back of your car

LARRY
Thats an empty coffin officer

The cop ignores him Phil lights his cigar

CON TINUE D MOTORCYCLE COP
I know it sounds strange But
these guys - there are two of
them - they stole a body loaded
it into the back of an old yellow
hearse painted with flowers and
theyre supposed to be driving
out this way

Larry thinks hard

LARRY
Hearse Flowers

He looks to Phil for support Phil raises an eyebrow
PHIL
I think hes onto us Larry
Hes just having a little fun at
our expense

The cop is no longer smiling

MOTORCYCLE COP
In the car please

Phil opens the door and empty beer bottles cascade out into
the road They get into the car and the cop cuffs them
together through the steering wheel and takes the car keys
Then he walks back over to his bike and starts to talk into
the radio

INT HEARSE DAY

Phil closes his eyes and shakes his head

PHIL
God damn
LARRY
He said a body He said we stole
a body
Phil opens his eyes
PHIL

He meant a coffin

LARRY

He didnt say coffin He said

They both stare out of the window Phil bangs the
against the wheel

PHIL

They sit glowering out of different windows at different
bits of desert The motorcycle cop can be heard talking
into his radio

LARRY
What are we going to do

PHIL
Time
LARRY
What
PHIL
(bitterly)

Were going to be arrested
thats what were going to do
Then well go to court and then
well go to jail and well do
that for a while

Larry mulls this over

LARRY
What about if I could slip out of
these cuffs

Phil treats the theoretical question with indifference

CON TINUE D PHIL
Yeah that would be great Then
we could suspend you froma
bridge in a straitjacket and set
the rope on fire

LARRY
No really I really can slip
these cuffs

He has Phils attention now

PHIL
Okay Show me
Larry pops his middle finger out of its socket squeezes
his hand and slides it out of the handcuff He hands the
other cuff to Phil who stares at him in astonishment

LARRY
Do you think we should go

PHIL
Yes I think we should go

Larry starts the car He throws it into reverse and the
bumper slowly disengages from the metal signpost Suddenly
the car tears loose and flies backwards smashing into the
cops motorcycle leaving him holding the radio and its
trailing wire Larry slams on the brakes

LARRY
Oh shit

PHIL
Nicely done

He rolls down his window and addresses the cop who is
staring with horror at his ruined motorcycle

PHIL (CONTD)
Well be moving on now that your
sign no longer appears to be
impeding our forward progress

Bernice accelerates away but slowly starts to turn ina
wide ark and circles the smashed bike The cop chases
them

INT HEARSE DAY
Phil screams at Larry

PHIL
What the hell are you doing

CON TINUE D

LARRY
The steering lock is on

PHIL
Well turn it off

LARRY
I cant - hes got the keys
Phil turns to watch the chasing policeman

PHIL

So weve escaped but we can only
drive in a circle

LARRY
Yes

EXT DESERT DAY

They do another circuit The exhausted cop stops
breathing heavily and then watches in astonishment as the
hearse turns and heads back towards him

INT HEARSE DAY

Phil and Larry stare at the policeman out of the window as
the car sweeps past The cop gets his gun out of his
holster and Phil reaches into the glove box and pulls out
the screwdriver He leans across Larry jams it into the
wheel column and snaps the steering lock in two The
hearses direction immediately changes

PHIL
Can we please go

LARRY
Okay

EXT DESERT DAY

The hearse roars away and the cop watches it go

problems with Gram

BARBARA

Gram Phil only ever did the
right thing

BARBARA
In his whole life Phil Kaufman

the right thing to do You can
bet the ranch that wherever he
is hes having some fun

CON TINUE D SUSIE
Maybe thats what I like about
him
BARBARA

Sure it is honey Thats why

SUSIE
Have you any idea what its like
to really love someone

Barbara laughs

BARBARA
You might exclusively love Phil
Kaufman - but unfortunately so
does he Youre just handy to

SUSIE
I dont have to listen to this

Susie leans over grabs the safety brake and pulls it up
hard The car swerves and skids to a stop

SUSIE (CONTD)
Okay you vindictive bitch Im
going with you to Joshua Tree
because my life seems to have
been turned upside down and I
want to know why But you dont

it matter

Susie looks surprised

SUSIE
It might get you further

BARBARA
I do okay Listen I was an
orphan at fourteen and a waitress
at fifteen I do what I do
because it puts food on my table
and because if I dont look after
myself no-one else will

SUSIE
So what do you want from us

BARBARA
I dont want anything from you
It would be a bonus to see
Kaufman crash and burn but I
dont need to be there when it
happens
SUSIE
Why do you hate Phil so much

Barbara lights another cigarette

BARBARA
Gram was the first good guy I
ever hooked up with He wasnt
perfect but it worked between
us We just seemed to fit
together But Gram was already
wild and I made him wilder
Kaufman watched over him like a
hawk and when he felt things
were getting out of control he
turned Gram against me I lost
the only decent thing in my life

SUSIE
Surely Phil was just looking
after Gram

CON TINUE D

BARBARA
Gram was an adult He didnt
need a nursemaid

LARRY
Anything within reason

Phil stares out of the window
PHIL
Thats what I hate about people
like you Everythings within
reason There are always
boundaries provisos You only
operate with a safety net
Larry is confused

LARRY
Tell me something - if it was the
other way round would Gram be
sitting here driving your bones
out into the desert

Phil says nothing

LARRY (CONTD)
Well

PHIL
Youve missed the point See it
doesnt matter what he would do
or what you and your tie-dyed
friends think is the correct way
to behave To me it only
matters what I do Where you
have boundaries and limits and
thresholds - I only have right
and wrong If I make a promise
I keep it - thats right If I
break that promise - thats
wrong

across the head with a bottle of Jack Daniels Phil slumps
back in the seat and Larry dropping the bloodied weapon

STANLEY
Its true that when Gram left

college we drifted apart
(MOR E) STA NLEY (CONTD)
He was a disappointment to me
because he wouldnt use his
brain He had so much to offer
but he let it trickle away

PHIL
No - he gave it his all but ina
way you could never understand
And all he ever wanted from you
was approval He wanted you to
be proud of what he had achieved

STANLEY
kept everything Every record
every article every photo

PHIL

should have told him

STANLEY

right-hand man as well as his

STANLEY
So the guilt isnt all mine

Susie walks over and takes Phils hand Stanley says
nothing for a moment but his eyes fill with tears

She walks over to the phone
BARBARA (CONTD)

him the sooner his soul will be
properly laid to rest

Phil walks over to Barbara picks her up and carries her
into the bathroom

BARBARA (CONTD)
Hey What the hell are you

He emerges and slips the back of a chair under the handle
effectively locking the door

STANLEY
Son you had your chance to look
after Gram and now hes dead

There is a bang from the bathroom and the door shakes

CON TINUE D BARBARA

Bastard
PHIL

I only failed because I couldnt
save him from himself You
failed him all his life You
never believed I never doubted

Stanley pauses

STANLEY
Okay You tell me why I should
let you take my boy

PHIL
I was his road manager and his
friend We loved it out here in
the desert and we made a pact
that whoever died first the
other would come down here and
set them free Gram gave his
word and I gave mine

Stanley thinks about this
STANLEY

Youre a couple of druggies Why

Another bang from the bathroom Stanley turns to Larry

STANLEY

There is a long pause Then

Yes Yes I am

Phil closes his eyes Stanley picks up the receiver and
starts to dial Then Phil jumps up off the bed and walks

Phil shoots Larry a dangerous look

CON TINUE D PHIL
Are we sure that this is helping

Larry ignores him

LARRY
And now Ive stopped I stopped
because it seems that I had
something more important to do

They all look at him He gestures at Phil

LARRY (CONTD)
Hes doing this because he gave
his word Im prepared to do
this now because I think its
right And because I believe
that each body has a soul And
Grams soul doesnt belong ina
family plot surrounded by
strangers It belongs here
where he was happiest

In the silence Susie walks over and grips Phils hand
Then Stanley gets up off the bed

STANLEY
Im going to go say goodbye to my
son

Everyone looks surprised Phil gives Larry a look of
appreciative approval Barbara starts to kick furiously at
the door from inside the bathroom Stanley pauses for a
moment and then walks outside Phil and Larry watch him
go and Susie walks over to kiss Phil
PHIL

SUSIE
Thats for failing to reinforce
my expectations

help Susie sits on a rock and watches

PHIL
You wanna give me a hand here

They walk it away from the car and lay it down As they
lower it the coffin slips out of Phils hands and bangs
down in the sand

PHIL (CONTD)
Sorry Gram

They stand and stare at the casket Susie walks over

the guitar and takes Phils hand

LARRY

PHIL
Now we do it

He gets the gasoline can from the car and stands over the
casket
PHIL (CONTD)

inside

LARRY
Well I dont know Maybe a
little more

Phil pours a little more fuel in He looks over at
Susie

PHIL
Enough

SUSIE
Im not having a conversation
with you about how much gasoline

She backs off
LARRY
I think thatll do it

Phil stops pouring and shakes the can

PHIL
Only a little left
He pours the rest of the can into the casket Susie walks
over to stand next to Phil He looks down at Gram

PHIL (CONTD)
Im sorry I wasnt there for you
when it mattered but I was there

They all stare at the casket Phil wipes a tear away and
tucks a can of beer into the coffin

CON TINUE D PHIL (CONTD)
Thats my last one man

He rests Grams guitar against the casket takes big puffs
on his cigar to get the flame up then tosses it into the
coffin They wait Nothing happens Phil edges nearer

and looks inside Then the coffin explodes into flames
All three of them are thrown backwards by the blast

EXT HIGHWAY NIGHT

The traffic cop is finishing the ticket when there is a
ball of flame in the distance Barbara just scowls

TRAFFIC COP
Jesus What the hells that
BARBARA
Thatll be Gram Parsons on fire

TRAFFIC COP
Get in the car maam Now

EXT DESERT NIGHT

Phil Larry and Susie pick themselves up They stare at
the pyre Phil is close to tears and Susie puts her arm
around him For a moment Phil thinks he sees the flames
morph into the shape of an angel over the burning coffin
The image disappears when Larry speaks

LARRY
Maybe too much fuel

PHIL
Nah I just didnt factor in the
booze inside of him Gram
always

He breaks off as a flashing police light appears in the
darkness followed by a siren

PHIL (CONTD)

Larry and Susie run to the car Phil lingers a moment
looking down at the flames Then he follows the others

observation

TRAFFIC COP

loud noise with a siren

TRAFFIC COP
Do you want to know what I think

to find out

The traffic cop stares into the fire

TRAFFIC COP

Then he glances in the rear view mirror and sees the man
sitting in the casket bay
