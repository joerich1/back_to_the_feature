She hands him a sack lunch and follows as he slouches toward

the door She watches from the curb as he heads toward the

school Some of the teachers lounging outside nod to her as

Walter approaches so she knows theyre aware that hes
there

She waves then hurriedly gets back on the street-car as it
rumbles away

INT PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY
Located on Grand Avenue downtown the huge switchboard room
is a maze of switching stations tangles of wires and heavy
wooden headsetsa roar of buzzers bells circuits opening
and closing and a hundred female operators speaking at
once

Supervisors on skates roll up and down the narrow lanes
created
by the banks of switching stations going from one operator
to another as needed Christine is one of them She turns
at the SOUND of a bell struck twice then rolls down the
lane

toward an OPERATOR frantically waving a pink sheet of paper

EXT PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - LUNCH AREA - DAY

Christine sits alone

eating a bag lunch and reading a thick

telephone company manual Working hard to advance herself

Then a bell rings time to return to work Other employees
gather up their belongings and start inside As Christine

closes the book her bookmark falls out As she picks it up

we see that its a childs drawing her and Walter (with
arrows

indicating who is who) on a green hill under an orange sun

She touches the drawing and smiles as the bell rings again
She grabs her belongs and heads back inside

sidewalk

CHRISTINE

Well the same day you were born

the mail in a box just slightly
bigger than you You know what was
in that box

(he shakes head)
Something called responsibility
Now to some people responsibility
is fun its what you live your
whole life for Other people think
its the scariest thing in the world

WALTER
So he ran away because he was scared
of what was in the box

CHRISTINE
Yup

WALTER

She turns and crouches down in front of him

CHRISTINE

that I would always tell you the
truth that I would treat you like

Captain Jones said something about
a change in height
CHRISTINE

Hes four inches shorter than --

DR TARR

Ah wellhardly a mystery Mrs
Collins Weve known for some time
that trauma can affect the growth
of children Given the stress of
the last four months his spine may
have actually shrunk Its uncommon
but within the realm of possibility

CHRISTINE
What about the circumcision

DR TARR
Very likely his abductor thought it
appropriate After all circumcision
is hygienically sound Must have
been quite traumatic at the time
No wonder hes submerged the memory

CHRISTINE
Look doctor --

DR TARR
As you can see theres a perfectly
sound medical explanation for all
of this But its good for you to
raise these questions You should
be apprised of all changes the lad
went through during his absence

CHRISTINE
Wouldnt I know whether or not he
was my son Im his mother
DR TARR
Which means youre in no position
to be objective You are looking
through the prism of extreme emotion
at a boy who has changed from what
you remember He isnt the same
boy that left here just as a boy
who goes off to war and returns
isnt the same anymore

My mom says were not supposed to
talk to strangers

DR TARR
Good boy Quite right But as you
see Im with the police so its
all right Now Im sure you know
Mrs Collins here and her son
Walter How many of you recognize
this young boy as Walter Collins

He looks from one child to the other They dont reply
Either they dont recognize him or theyre intimidated

DR TARR
Now now no need to be afraid
Surely you knew Walter and played
with him So which of you can
identify Walter for me for his
mother and for the police This
officer would want you to do the
right thing as good young citizens

The kids exchange a glance Its clear they dont recognize
the boy but theyre intimidated by the presence of Tarr and
the police officer A few reluctantly raise their hands
Another of them goes to Walter who is shorter than he is

2ND KID
Walter was as tall as me

DR TARR
Yes precisely He was as tall as
you Now hes not Hes lost a
little height you see Its a
thing called trauma With luck
none of you will ever have to find
out about it yourselves So other
than that do you recognize this as
your friend Walter Collins

course of my examination I found
nothing to dispute the findings by

tell anyone what happened while he
was gone

I would say that the boy has either
been coached or questioned to a
point where he is largely confused
about what happened to him during

CHANGELING A True Story

DR TARR (Contd)
those many months Its possible
that his mental lapse may be the
result of a blow to the head or a
sudden shock which brought about a
possible cranial injury I believe
that this condition will pass soon
Until then I recommend that the
police department continue working
with him exposing him to whatever
elements of his previous life as
may help restore his memory

Good morning My name is Christine

year old son Walter Collins
disappeared A four month
investigation resulted in a boy
being brought to Los Angeles from
De Kalb Illinois They told me
and all of you that this boy was
my son They were wrong

(beat)
The Los Angeles Police Department
made a mistakea terrible mistake
The boy they found is not my son
That is the reason for the supposed
transformation I have letters
from his dentist his teachers and
others confirming that this boy is
not my son The letters are being
reprinted now and I should have
them for you tomorrow

pop dazzling her She composes herself

CHRISTINE

I have given the police department
every opportunity to admit their
mistake and renew the search for my
son Since they have refused to do
so I have no choice but to present
my case before the public I hope
this will persuade the police to
finish the job they started and
bring my son home to me

INT CITY COUNCIL ROOM - DAY

rest of the City Council Christine and the huge audience
looking on

JONES
We then instituted a nationwide
search On July 10 we received a
cable indicating that a boy matching
his description had been found in
De Kalb Illinois Upon questioning
he admitted to being Walter Collins
and we made arrangements to transport
him back to California

HAHN
Where Mrs Collins told you the boy
was not her son

CHANGELING A True Story

JONES
Yes She denied his identity in
spite of all evidence pointing to
the contrary

HAHN
But as subsequent events have
demonstrated she was correct So
what prompted you to send her for
psychological evaluation

JONES
Whether or not this was in fact the
correct boy was not relevant to my
decision Throughout this period
she acted strangely She was often
cool aloof and unemotional
especially when presented with the
boy we located in De Kalb and in
our subsequent conversations It
was because of her disturbing
behavior that I submitted her for
observation to the psychopathic
ward of Los Angeles County General
Hospital

HAHN
Just like that You snap your
fingers and an innocent woman is
thrown into the psycho ward

JONES
She wasnt --

Hahn turns away playing to the council and the audience

HAHN
Every home in this state is in grave
danger when a Police Captain can
take a woman into his office and
five minutes later have her thrown
into the psychopathic ward on his
own authority

The crowd applauds and cheers Joes fights to be heard

(over the crowd)
She wasnt --

HAHN
What was that Captain

JONES
She wasnt thrown She was
escorted

CHANGELING A True Story

Theres laughter from the gallery He doesnt like it

HAHN
Escorted thrown the verb doesnt
matter Captain What does matter
is that her incarceration was ordered
without a warrant

Hahn goes to the exhibit table picks up several papers

HAHN
I am holding a carbon copy of the
affidavit of insanity that was issued
in the case of the State of
California vs Christine Collins
Who signed the affidavit

JONES
I did

HAHN
And what is the date on this
document

JONES

September 12th

HAHN
But Mrs Collins was incarcerated
on September 6th

JONES
The form is backdated

HAHN
Yes so it would appear The bottom
of the page is reserved for recording
where and when the warrant was
served But it has not been filled
in May I assume from this that
the warrant was never served

JONES
Thats correct There was no need
to serve the warrant since she was
at that time already in custody

HAHN
Let me see if I have this straight
A woman was thrown into the
psychopathic ward without a warrant

because no warrant existed and

when it was finally written six

days later there was no need to

sign it or go to a judge because

CHANGELING A True Story

HAHN (Contd)
she was already in the asylum Is
this correct Captain

JONES
Technicallyyes

More murmuring from the crowd

JONES
Extraordinary steps were necessary
because we were dealing with an
extraordinary situation Is it our
fault that we were being deceived
by the boy who claimed to be Walter
Collins No In light of his claims
and her behavior who wouldnt begin
to wonder if there was something
wrong with her

HAHN
Because she questioned you

JONES
Because she wouldnt listen because
she insisted on being obstinate and
taking matters into her own hands
best left to qualified officers
because --

HAHN
Because she was fighting for the
life of her son A boy who may
have still been alive while you
were wasting valuable time denying
you had done anything wrong

This silences both Jones and the crowd You could hear a pin
drop Hahn approaches Jones and now speaks softly

HAHN
And in the end thats what happened
isnt it At some point while all
this was going on Walter Collins
died along with as many as nineteen
other youths on the Northcott Ranch
in Wineville Is that correct

yank the chicken wire and bring
down the corner maybe make enough

but was forced to resign a second time under a cloud of

corruption

justice system in California was revised to prevent women

from being incarcerated or institutionalized for the crime

procedures were set in place to prevent future abuse

In November 1929 Los Angeles Mayor George E Cryer was

out of office after three terms He was later found to have
been the front man for the Crawford Organized Crime

which ran prostitution and gambling rackets throughout
