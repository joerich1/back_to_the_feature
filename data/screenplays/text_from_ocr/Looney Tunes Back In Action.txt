OVER BLACK

We hear “Merrily We Roll Along” a strangely forboding
pipe organ version Then SCREAMS

ANIMATED IN THE STYLE OF “BATMAN BEYOND” 1

A terrified crowd rushes the screen escaping ELMER in
evil clown make-up riding atop a mammoth 19th CENTURY
CIRCUS CALLIOPE Screaming steam shoots from the Calliope
as mechanical arms overturn cars and loot stores

ELMER
(Maniacal Laugh)

A dark figure drops down in its path It’s DAFFY He
faces off against the mechanical monstrosity A steel
claw grabs for him he leaps aside He jumps on the claw

Daffy is hoisted skyward He spies a small open panel on
the calliope It is a maze of wires and circuits In
DAFFYS COMPUTER-LIKE MIND the circuits are analyzed in
3-D and the system’s Achilles Heel is located

A grim Daffy plucks a feather from his chin and directs
the quill precisely into the circuit board

The circuit crackles The calliope shudders and bucks

The calliope explodes into a fireball which Daffy rides
toward camera a la “Mission Impossible”

VOICE (0OS)
Hold on

The cartoon image on screen freezes

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 2

Daffy sits at a large conference table headed by MR

WARNER and MR WARNER’S BROTHER The end of the table is
crammed with identical JUNIOR EXECUTIVES on chairs that
put their heads only halfway above the lip of the table

DAFFY
Wait There’s a love story

MR WARNER

(perplexed)
You killed Elmer

(CONTTNUED )

MR WARNER’S BROTHER
You can’t kill Elmer

DAFFY
He comes back from the dead later
Scar-faced and even more insane
ELMER
I don’t want to play a crazy
clown I’m afraid of clowns

What’s up Doc

BUGS BUNNY

stands at the doorway to the conference room
dramatically backlit

BACK TO SCENE

All the Junior Executives at the table LAUGH
UPROARIOUSLY Daffy looks steamed

ON BUGS

As he strolls to his seat he gestures to executives in

their chairs

BUGS (CONTD)
Colin saw the piece in Variety
Mr Big Shot Hey Kyle Day

Bugs play boxes with an executive affectionately then

turns to another executive very concerned

BUGS (CONTD)
(very sincere)
Ian if your sister needs anymore
bone marrow I’m there

Bugs sits down and turns to Daffy

BUGS (CONTD)
So Daf I was reading this rewrite

ANIMATED IN THE STYLE OF BATMAN BEYOND 3
As the calliope explodes from several angles we PAN DOWN
to street level A manhole cover opens and a particularly

dumb-looking Bugs emerges chomping a carrot

BUGS
Duh what’s up Doc

The carrot is revealed to have a fast-burning fuse It
EXPLODES A charred Bugs looks stupefied Then a huge
flaming chunk of calliope lands on his head

BACK TO SCENE 4

Bugs rises nonchalant readying his exit

BUGS
Fine with me The money all goes
to the wives anyway

DAFFY
(smug victorious)
We’1ll invite you to the premiere

KATE (0S)
Excuse me I’m sorry

This is KATE She speaks quickly confidently as if she
doesn’t need anything or anybody but we all know better

KATE (CONTD)
I don’t think we can have a Bugs
Bunny movie without Bugs Bunny

MR WARNER
A Bugs Bunny movie without Bugs
Bunny Whoever heard of such a
thing

MR WARNER’S BROTHER
I think we just did

Daffy paces down the table acting thoughtful

DAFFY
Oh my heavens no You couldn’t
have a movie without Bugs Bunny
Riots in the streets The fall of
western civilization It’d be like
meatless meat Creme without
brulee

Daffy winds up standing on the table in Kate’s face

DAFFY (CONTD)
(very condescending)
Say if you don’t mind my asking
whose assistant are you

Kate grabs Daffy’s hand and squeezes it His head
expands

As Kate releases Daffy’s hand Daffy’s head deflates to
slightly less than normal accompanied by the HIGH SQUEAK
OF A LEAKING BALLOON

MR WARNER
(enthusiastic)
Kate did “Lethal Weapon Babies”

He points to a poster similar to a “Lethal Weapon”
poster only Danny Glover and Mel Gibson are airbrushed
babies (not cartoons) The catchphrase is “Nap Time’s
Over” The movie is rated PG-17

MR WARNER’S BROTHER
Finally a “Lethal Weapon” I can
take my grandchildren to

MR WARNER
We’ve brought Kate in because we
think she can really add something
to the Loopy Tunes mix

We see Daffy making a quick calculation in his head and
then suddenly turn to Kate sucking up desperately

DAFFY
Fresh perspective just what we
need -- new ideas for a post-Bugs-

Bunny world

Kate pulls out her extremely cool Sprint computerphone
and calls up a bunch of charts and graphs on it

(CONTTNUED ) 4

KATE
Actually our latest research
shows that Bugs Bunny is a core
asset that appeals to male and
female young and old throughout
the known universe

We cut to Bugs He is busily cleaning himself licking
his paw and rubbing it over his face

KATE (CONTD)
while your fanbase is limited
to angry fat guys in basements
And there’s only seven of them

DAFFY
Did you count Ted

KATE
(checking phone)
Yes

Daffy SWALLOWS nervously He turns to the Warner
Brothers pleading

DAFFY
C’mmmmmmon fellas Im thrice the
entertainer the rabbit is

BUGS
casual belch

The room bursts into LAUGHTER

DAFFY
(dryly)
Yes he’s hilarious But
moviegoers these days demand
action

Daffy launches into a kung fu routine

DAFFY (CONTD)
Hah Ho Ah-cha-cha

Daffy executes a flurry of judo-like moves resulting in
his arm being stuck in his ear up to his elbow (his hand
protrudes from the opposite ear) Daffy extracts his hand
and shakes goo off it

DAFFY (CONTD)
Top that rabbit

(CONTTNUED ) 4

Bugs gracefully assumes an elaborate karate pose

BUGS
(perfectly poised)
Kong Que (Kong KYU-yu-ah) “The
Peacock”

He lightly flicks the back of Daffy’s head with his toe
Daffy’s EYES POP OUT and bounce around on the table

VARIOUS EXECUTIVES
Ooh Aah Etc

Daffy blindly swipes at the awkwardly bouncing eyes
(which watch with alarm) Bugs throws some jacks down on
the table and starts picking them up as the eyes bounce
Daffy angrily catches his eyes then shoves the eyes up
close to Bugs’ face They squint

DAFFY
Despicable

KATE
You can’t have his eyeballs
falling out like that It makes
people think of their own eyeballs
falling out

Shoving his eyes back in Daffy takes his stand

DAFFY
Soit has come to this Im afraid
the brothers Warner must choose
between a handsome matinee idol
or

We cut back to Bugs He is offering his finger to an
executive happily The executive tentatively pulls it
Confetti flies out of Bugs’ ears

DAFFY (CONT’D)

low burlesque

Look I don’t think it has to be
one or--

MR WARNER’S BROTHER
Whichever one’s not the duck

Mr Warner reaches down and picks up a cardboard box
containing assorted pictures and stuffed Daffys etc (a
black-and-white picture of Daffy with Nixon six-pound
barbell one of those executive clacky-ball things a
bottle of Chambord)

MR WARNER
Here’s the stuff from your office

Bugs starts casually picking through the stuff Daffy is
stunned Kate appears confused

KATE
(clarifying)
You’re firing Daffy Duck
MR WARNER
Oh no we’re not firing Daffy
Duck
MR WARNER’S BROTHER

KATE
(accepting decision)
Okay

She turns to Daffy businesslike and starts leading him
out

KATE (CONTD)
I’m sorry it had to come to this

Kate starts to lead Daffy out He turns back toward the

Warner Brothers spouting tears even as Kate continues
to move him toward the door

As he’s talking Daffy is looking around with the
magnifying glass He looks towards the audience and we
see his eye in the magnifying glass On the word “lair”
he pulls the magnifying glass away from his face but
there is still an eye in the glass that continues looking
around as he says “Nothing is as it seems”

The cafe is called “PASSE D’ JO” Daffy and Bugs sit at a
table looking impatient

Kate and DJ drop out of the sky and into their chairs
The ropes fall off Kate she casually removes her gag DJ
puts the flowers and chocolates down and begins the scene
grimly as if nothing strange had just happened

DJ
Okay they’ve got the camera
which means they’1ll have the map

KATE
No the great thing is you don’t
have to develop it It’s digital

Mr Smith plugs the phonecamera into the console next to
Mr Chairman who pets a large cow’s liver

MR CHAIRMAN
Friends I reveal to you the
whereabouts of the Blue Monkey

screen shows the picture Kate took before the dais

It shows an exquisite 15th century map of Africa on the
left half On the right half is Daffy staring into the
camera

Mr Chairman angrily throws the remote at the video
screen It makes a breaking sound a little smoke comes
out and it goes up into the ceiling

MR CHAIRMAN (CONT’D)
How can I be expected to run a
multinational evil corporation
with such incompetence

VP NOT KEEP MOUTH SHUT
Is that a rhetorical question

Mr Chairman pushes a button The VP is quickly wrapped
in saran wrap He struggles for a moment and stops

MR CHAIRMAN
We can not allow some boy and girl
and duck and rabbit to thwart our
plan for global domination

DAMIAN (0S)
Wanna bet

Damian is suspended in a harness and covered with
hundreds of electrodes The mad scientist from earlier
operates a small box that appears to allow him to control
the movements of Damian who is moving somewhat like an
ultimate fighter in a video game

Mr Chairman takes the box from the mad scientist

MR CHAIRMAN
A wager

DAMIAN
Five dollars says my son scuttles
your diabolical plan and saves the
world

MR CHAIRMAN
Youre on

Mr Chairman manipulates the knobs on the small box and
Damian starts smacking himself squarely on the face

EXT AFRICAN JUNGLE - DAY 187

DJ in sweat-drenched safari gear stands in a clearing
He points his machete at some dense foliage

DJ
It’s another six-thousand cubits
in the thick direction

Kate Bugs and Daffy are clearly not up for that

DJ (CONTD)
Come on If the bad guys get the
diamond they’1l plunge the earth
into an endless night of evil and
only one of us wants that

Kate shoots him a look

DJ (CONTD)
Not you I meant Daffy

DAFFY
(shrugs)
True It’s basically win-win for
me

In the distance a funnel cloud made of foliage springs
up A DISTANT GNASHING can be heard As our guys watch
trees fall like dominoes Then animals flee toward us as
if a lion were attacking Whatever it is its getting
closer A tree topples directly in front of our people
it trunk is then RAZORED in two by something moving too
fast to make out The tiny tornado stops its the

Yes ma’am

Taz begins to slobber viciously

HIS PANNING POV

Bugs transforms into a delicious roast rabbit

Daffy transforms into a delicious baked ham

DJ transforms into a giant hot dog

Kate transforms into a chocolate eclair

BACK TO SCENE

Drooling Taz approaches affixing a napkin to his neck
DJ gets an idea He pulls the Proboscinator from his
pocket surreptitiously activating He holds the nose

aloft and waves it around (Smell lines radiate)

DJ
Here boy You want a treat boy

Taz zooms up like a dog
DJ (CONTD)
Sit boy Beg Roll over Back
flip

Taz does all these in quick succession

DJ drops the nose into Taz’s mouth Taz gobbles it like a
dog licks his lips then turns back to them

Taz takes two steps forward then looks puzzled Smell
lines radiate from his body As he looks down his body
transforms into a delicious roast

TASMANIAN DEVIL

Taz quickly gobbles himself leaving only his mouth The
mouth hangs in the air for a moment chagrined The mouth
drops to the ground and runs off into the jungle

The vegetation breaks away as DJ chops through it Behind
him the other weakly swing their machetes chopping

BUGS

DAFFY
Sorry old chap

Bugs slaps his tail back on Kate slumps to the ground

KATE
I can’t go any further

DAFFY

And I’m not leaving her here

Suddenly we hear a great CRASHING AND THRASHING
Everyone turns in alarm A HUGE ELEPHANT bursts through
the underbrush It snorts ferociously Our heroes recoil

VOICE (0S)
Bad elephant

It’s TWEETY who swings in a cage on the elephant’s head

The fully loaded elephant trudges past several scenic
vistas

The characters are jarred from their lumbering by a

surrounded by giant stone monkeys

DJ
Looks like this is our stop

They dismount DJ pulls out his wallet

TWEETY
Oh you put your money away

GRANNY

It was our pleasure Enjoy the

rest of your adventure
The elephant turns and exits
DJ puts his arm around Kate and they gaze into a tall
ancient corridor leading up to a stone monkey altar
bathed in blue light
Daffy dashes past them

DAFFY
It’s mine All mine

DJ manages to grab Daffy by the tail feathers He holds
him upside down and shows him

(CONTTNUED )

A DISNEY-STYLE SIGN

Reading GAUNTLET OF DEATH A smaller sign reads You
must be at least this tall to die horribly

They look closer at the walls of the corridor They’re
covered with horrific visages gargoylesand a duck
skull In the distance a volcano RUMBLES Nearby lava
tubes emerge from the ground spouting flames

DAFFY (CONTD)
(still upside down)
You know I hadn’t noticed that

DJ drops Daffy to the ground He picks up a coconut and
throws it in the gauntlet Before it can even land a
primitive trap springs up impaling it Coconut milk
spurts out like blood

BUGS
Well that explains all the
skeletons And most of the
coconuts

DJ dead serious heads toward the gauntlet

KATE
DJ what are you a maniac

DJ
I’m a trained maniac

Proceeding with precision and grace DJ negotiates a
series of traps without activating them including darts
set to cloud the air with needles spikes driven upward
from the grass

DAFFY
(impatient)
For crying out loud time is
moolah Get the lead out

Daffy claps like a baseball coach Kate grabs his hands
and squeezes them hard

DJ treads carefully through some poisonous snakes

DAFFY (CONTD)

(desperate)
C’mon move it My greed needs to
be slaked

(CONTTNUED ) 191

DJ
(very evenly)
Relax This is going to take a few
more hours

DAFFY
A few more hours Forget that
Mister

Daffy marches into the gauntlet He immediately starts
setting off the traps

SUPER ACTION-PACKED SEQUENCE 192

DJ and Daffy proceed through the gauntlet in tandem with
one important difference while DJ artfully and amazingly
dodges each deadly blow Daffy takes the full brunt of
each punishment

DJ deflectscatches dozens of deadly darts Daffy is
multiply pierced

DJ flips over a pit Daffy falls in and crawls out
covered with scorpions

DJ runs up the wall to avoid flames shooting from the
mouths of stone monkey reliefs Daffy staggers out of the
flames a cinder with eyes

DJ leaps backwards as if high jumping between two
slicing scimitars The scimitars slice Daffy into four
pieces each piece is swallowed by a separate snapping
Venus Flytrap A flytrap comes for DJ he punches it and
knocks it unconscious

A few feet ahead Daffy grows out of the ground as a
sheepish Daffy Daisy DJ “picks” Daffy and charges
forward barely missing various arrows boulders etc
EXT MONKEY PEDESTAL AREA - CONTINUOUS 193

Bugs comes up behind Daffy

BUGS
Nobody takes a deadly blow more
hilariously than Daffy Duck

Bugs pats Daffy’s shoulder Daffy’s arm falls off

DJ approaches the blue glow A pedestal Daffy zips in
front of him

DAFFY
Hello wealth and
(voice dropping)
power

Its a small blue monkey-shaped stone on a stone ring
Daffy picks it up

DAFFY (CONTD)
This is the Blue Monkey This
dime store bauble I’ve been
rooked Grifted by the gods

Daffy raises his arms heavenward

DAFFY (CONT’D)
I demand recompense Where’s my
humongous gem

Kate plucks the ring from Daffy’s hand

KATE
Wait a second This is a Tessella

Everyone stares at her

KATE (CONTD)
(explaining)
A mosaic piece identical
interlocking shapes which form a
pattern first used in Ancient
Mesopotamia

(CONTTNUED ) 193

They still stare at her

KATE (CONTD)
See I don’t have an IQ of 106
(points)
Plus I noticed there was a piece
missing from this one

She points to a large tessellation on the wall (or
floor) made of identical monkey shapes and forming one
large monkey shape Kate puts on the ring and inserts the
monkey in an empty space in the center of the mosaic

With an ANCIENT CREAKING SOUND the monkey-shaped mosaic
emerges from the wall Kate is taken aback momentarily
On a hunch she turns her fist The monkey ring turns the
monkey mosaic like a key it rotates clockwise

The ground TREMBLES
Everyone turns in half-horror to see what happens next
In front of them a spectacular achievement in set

direction unfolds The wall behind the pedestal lowers
down forming a bridge across a molten lava moat to

EXT MONKEY ALTAR — CONTINUOUS 194

It’s really something You should see the drawings They
stare in awe Daffy zips past them

Daffy races up the side of altar and runs toward the
Buddha monkey He dives for the diamond

Daffy stops in mid-air inches from the Blue Monkey DJ
is holding Daffy perpendicular by the legs

DI
If you don’t mind

Daffy droops down and DJ drops him As he gets up
DAFFY
Mind I was just poisoned burnt

chopped and eaten for that
diamond Why should I mind

(CONTTNUED )

DJ stands before the diamond solemnly He removes it
from the statue’s hands Its facets are cut in such a way
that the slightly bluish face of a monkey appears in the
center of it DJ holds the diamond aloft

DJ
This is for you Dad

Sunlight hits the diamond It glows Light gathers in the
eyes of the monkey inside and a BLUE BEAM shoots out

DJ is engulfed in a field of blue energy In seconds we
watch as he DE-EVOLVES BEFORE OUR EYES He goes from DJ
to Airheads to George of the Jungle to Encino Man to Cro-
Magnon until finally the beam stops - leaving him a
MONKEY The Monkey gives a SCREECH

DAFFY
Why DJ why Why you Why
wasnt it me Just academic
curiosity you understand
Daffy picks up the diamond again this time backwards He
notices from this side there seems to be a reddish human
face inside

DAFFY (CONT’D)
greedy chuckle

Sunlight hits the diamond sending out a RED BEAM

RED energy engulfs the monkey We watch as DJ RE-EVOLVES
from monkey to caveman until once again he is DJ

Daffy drops the diamond and embraces DJ

DAFFY (CONT’D)
DJ Buddy You’re okay

GRANNY (0S)

A blue light envelopes Damian Drake He quickly devolves
into a monkey A much smaller monkey He escapes his
chains and scampers off EEPING

Mr Smith comes after DJ DJ turns and tosses the diamond

Kate catches the diamond but the sun hits it A blue
