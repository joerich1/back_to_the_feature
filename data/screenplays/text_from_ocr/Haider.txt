It is the mid-1990s and the insurgency in Kashmir is at its
peak The Indian defence establishment is finding it difficult
to penetrate the extremist groups which are supported by
Pakistan and protected by locals To meet this challenge the
Indian intelligence has formed the ‘Ikhwaan-ul-Muslameen’
a counter-insurgent militia comprising of surrendered and
captured militants The Ikhbwaanis play a key role in reducing
militancy in the valley The Indian government has decided
to hold elections within the next six months to show the
world that things are under control in Kashmir

betrayed and murdered his own brother the older king

The song tells of how the new king longed for the queen and
would do anything to have her The old king was considered
a traitor by the feudal lord who conquered their kingdom
His brother was hand-in-glove with the feudal lord therefore
they both conspired to trap the old king and killed him to
ensure that the kingdom and the queen would be the new
king’s forever

place where Ali was firing from As Ali opens the window
the two Ikhwaan soldiers shower bullets Ali screams and
falls back The gravedigger runs to the room to find Ali dead

in a pool of blood The gravedigger holds his dead body and
howls

Haider notices the two soldiers coming closer He quickly
reaches an AK47 but fumbles as he tries to load it The
Ikhwaanis are barely a few feet away from him now only a
wall separates them He struggles barely managing to cock
the weapon and fire rather amateurishly killing one of the
two just as they appear from behind the wall The other
retreats

The grieving gravedigger picks up a grenade runs out of
the house and hurls it onto an Ikhwaan jeep The jeep
explodes Khurram rolls over behind the rock as the bodies
fly apart The gravedigger is showered with bullets by the
other Ikhbwaanis
