Shang One moment you seem to be missing something Chi Fu brings out two

large bronze disks Shang takes out one disk and holds it

high speaking to all the troops This represents discipline Shang hands
the weight to Yao and the weight falls to the ground taking Yaos

arm with it and this represents strength Shang hands the other weight to
Yao making him fall to the ground The troops laugh while

Mulan looks concerned You need both to reach the arrow

from one bow

Tranquil as a forest

The recruits try and fail Mulan gets ready to fire when Mushu sticks a
target on her arrow before she shoots Mulan looks at Mushus in

shock and pauses Shang looks disdainfully at Mulan as she cracks a huge
smile

But on fire within

Shang balances a bucket of water on his head holding a staff The recruits
fire stones at him which Shang deflect with the staff

Once you find your center

You are sure to win

Mulan wobbles with the bucket of water on her head As the recruits throw
stones at her the bucket tips over onto her head

her hand down into the river and retrieves Yaos foot Mushu

comes out of the water with a fish in hand to give to Mulan

Somehow Ill make a man

her back into a tree

right through me

Chien-Po stops as hes hopping across poles protruding from water causing
Shang and the recruits to pile into him

Now I really wish that I

knew how to swim

Shang and Chorus

Cannon fire misses the target in the middle of an open field Ling kicks the
support structure out from Mulans cannon and it begins to fall

Mulan quickly grabs the cannon and it fires high and back towards the camp

Chi Fu points Shangs eyes back to a struggling Mulan who falls to the
ground Cri-Kee and Mushu try to pick her up but hide when Shang

comes up to her Shang picks up her pole with grain puts it on top of his
and returns to the troops Mulan looks rejected

Heed my every order

and you might survive

Shang hand the reigns of Khan to Mulan

Youre unsuited for

the rage of war

So pack up go home

How could I make a man

out of you

Shang and Chorus Mulan takes the weights and tries to climb the pole again
(Be a man)

We must be swift as

the coursing river

Mulan ties the weights together behind the pole and uses the cloth to help
her shimmy up the pole

(Be a man)

With all the force

of a great typhoon

As the sun begins to rise the recruits come out of their tents to cheer on
Mulan
(Be a man)

With all the strength

of a raging fire

As Shang comes out of his tent the arrow he shot up onto the pole comes
down to his feet He looks up and sees Mulan sitting on top of

the pole

In a thundering herd

artistry section where the images are drawn like painted people Ling is
seen looking at a woman and then kissing her

I want her paler than the

moon with eyes that

shine like stars

Yao lifting and lowering a woman over his head then opening his chest to
show a gaping wound that we can see the woman through

My girl will marvel at

my strength adore my

battle scars

Chien-Po Chien-Po and a woman circle around then land on the edge of a large
bowl of rice as a cow pig and chicken fall beside them

I couldnt care less what shell

It all depends on what

she cooks like

Beef pork chicken end painted people section the last image fades into

statues that the troops just passed

Ling with armor full of water to make him look muscular
And Ill bet the ladies love
aman in armor the water leaks out making Ling look like his normal self

Army Chorus Mushu whistles to ladies working in the rice field from out of
the carriage holding cannons Cri-Kee looks shocked The
ladies look and giggle at Mulan who hides her face

Mulan Caught between Yao Ling and Chien-Po who all look up dreamily
waiting for her ideal woman She is forced to speak (sing)

spoken Uh singing How about a girl whos

Who always speaks her mind Mulan shrugs her shoulders

Ling Yao and Chien-Po disdainfully looking disappointed and disgusted
Nah

Ling grabbing Mulans shoulder and leaning on her she takes his hand off
and shakes her head disapprovingly Ling leans against the

carriage of cannons

My manly ways and turns of

phrase are sure to thrill her

Yao hitting Khan so that the carriage runs out from under Ling Ling looks
upset then falls in the mud

He thinks hes such a

lady-killer

Chi Fu

horror on their faces as they look into the valley Chien-Po

Chien-po handing the helmet to Shang the General

Shang takes the helmet and walks to the edge of the hill He draws his
sword and stabs it into the snow upright He kneels down and
places the helmet on top of the sword Mulan approaches him from behind

Mulan softly Im sorry

Shang gets up turns around and puts his hand on Mulans shoulder and he
walks by Shang walks to the center of the troops He grabs his
horse by the saddle takes one quick look of grief then mounts his horse

Shang The Huns are moving quickly Well make better time to the Imperial
City through the Tung Shao Pass Were the only hope for the

cannon blast shoots out of the cart and explodes in the air The

troops look surprised Mulan glances back with a scowl into the hole in the
canopy of the cart to see Mushu with a sorrowful face Mushu

behind

Shang angrily What happened
Mulan stumbling Uhhh--

Shang You just gave away our position Now were--an arrow hits Shang in
the shoulder as he falls to the ground Shang pulls out the
arrow calling out Get out of range

The troops hurriedly run away as many arrows start falling all around them
Mulan pulls Khan by the reins to hurry him up Fire arrows

start hitting the cart with cannons attached to Khan The cart begins to
blaze with fire

Shang Save the cannons

The troops form a human chain and start taking the cannons out of the
burning cart one by one while Mulan steadies Khan to keep him

from bolting Chien-Po grabs many and hauls them on his own The troops
grabas many cannons as they safely can and Mulan cuts Khan

free from the cart She mounts Khan and charges away from the fire The
cart explodes sending Mulan flying off Khan losing her helmet

and sword which land near her Mushu and Cri-Kee sent flying by the blast

They launch a volley at the mountain where the archers are stationed As
the cannon fire explodes Shan-Yus army hides

Shang Fire

(Mulan Ling and Chien-Po launch a second volley at the mountain where the
archers are stationed No more arrows can be seen coming
from the mountain position

Shang Hold the last cannon Yao poised to light his cannon pauses
Shan-Yu and his troops appear at the top of the mountain Prepare
to fight If we die we die with honor

Shan-Yu raises his sword high above his head and charges down the mountain
at Shangs position His falcon flies off his shoulder on
Shan-Yus war cry The Hun army follows

Shang Yao aim the cannon at Shan-Yu

The line of Shangs troops with Mulan at the end draw their swords Mulan
looks down at her sword and sees the reflection of a large snow
embankment hanging to the side of a cliff She rushes forward

Yao being pushed aside by Mulan as she grabs the cannon Hey

Shang Ping come back Ping

Mulan charges forward towards the oncoming horde of the Hun army being led
by Shan-Yu and his falcon Mushu looks over her at the

oncoming horde with worry in his eyes

Shang starting to run after her waving his arms Stop

(Mulan plants the cannon and aims it for the cliff with the snow overhang

Mushu seeing Shan-Yu riding closer to their position All right you might
want to light that right about now Quickly Quickly

Mulan takes out the flint and tries to light the fuse Shan-Yus falcon
swoops buy knocking Mulan down scattering the flint rock

Yao speaking to Ling and Chien-Po Cmon weve gotta help they charge
towards Mulans position

Mulan searches for the flint in the snow in vain She sees Mushu grabs him
and stretches him causing him to light the fuse Mushu lands
on the cannon and the cannon fires off just above the charging Shan-Yu

Mushu tailing off as he rides the cannon toward the snow embankment You
missed him How could you miss He was three feet in
front of you

The cannon lodges in the snow and explodes causing the beginning of a large
avalanche Mulan looks up with an evil grin on her face and

Shan-Yu watches in horror as many of his troops begin to be swallowed up by
the snow

Shan-Yu recollecting himself and focusing in on Mulan Yrrrrrrraah

Shan-Yu swipes at Mulan with his sword hitting her in the right side Mulan
falls back grabbing her right side Shan-Yus horse stumbles

Mulan uses this break to bolt away from the avalanche Shan-Yu gains his
composure and starts to gallop away from the avalanche on his

horse Shang looks with shock as hee sees the avalanche coming toward him
Mulan grabs Shang as she passes by him turning him

around and helping him run away from the avalanche
