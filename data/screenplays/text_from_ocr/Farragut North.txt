isnt the right word It’s more
than that You exude something
You draw people in All the
reporters love you Even the ones
that hate you love you You play
them all like they’re pieces on a
chess board And you make it look
effortless We both know how much
work it takes constantly being on
guard weighing every word so
carefully every move But from
the outside you make it look
easy People are scared of you
because they don’t understand how
you do it and they love you for
it There’s nothing more valuable
in this business -- the ability to
win people’s respect by making
them mistake their fear for love

Stephen is holding the papers from the folder
STEPHEN

So you’re telling me every poll on
the planet is wrong

DUFFY
The slide in your numbers Twenty
percent of your top support is
actually our people We’ve been
telling them to pose as Morris
supporters when the pollsters
call Inflates your lead makes
you feel comfortable makes us
look like the underdog Now we’re
telling them to switch back Day
or two before the 19th we‘ll jump
ahead It‘1ll look like a come-
from-behind victory when in
reality weve been ahead all
along

STEPHEN
There’s no way you could’ve
organized that many people and
kept it secret

DUFFY
That’s just the tip of iceberg
Steve We’ve got mass mailings
and robo-calls going out to your
supporters with wrong caucus
locations On game day I’1l send
vans to your strong areas to cause
traffic jams And for those who
actually make it to the caucus
They‘ll find that a third of your
precinct captains are actually
working for us On top of all
that weve got Thompson in the
bag

STEPHEN
I know for a fact weve got
Thompson

DUFFY
Do you

STEPHEN
Paul met with him today to
finalize it

DUFFY
I know he did But we promised
Thompson Secretary of Labor so
he‘1l do anything we ask -- like
dangle a carrot in front of Pauls
face until we tell him to yank it
away

This is a lot for Stephen to swallow He’s not sure
whether it’s a bluff or could be true

DUFFY

over for weeks Come work for

straight at the top

Steve stands

states shown and a big star indicated where Kirksville’s

Stephen is

peering in through the door to a gymnasium

packed with almost everyone in town At the far end is
Governor Morris delivering his standard stump speech

59

Stephen turns and slowly starts walking up the hallway
We see him stop at a locker He pauses for a moment
then bends over to try the combination It works He
opens the locker and peers inside The shelf full of
books The back of the door is plastered with photos of
a girl -- presumably a cheerleader -- and her friends

As well as the photo of some hunky movie star He gently
shuts the locker

CuT TO

FARTHER DOWN THE HALL 60

Stephen stands in front of a trophy case

THROUGH HIS POV

we SCAN ALONG the various trophies Each has a group
photo of the triumphant team behind it Some are rather
old and are covered in their fair share of dust

We STOP AT one and TIGHTEN It’s a basketball trophy
from over a decade ago We TIGHTEN MORE ON the photo
behind it Among the dozen or so teammates we see
Stephen a fresh and eager 18-year-old Everyone else is
smiling except for Stephen whose intense expression
indicates a boy full of pride and ambition

CLOSEUP OF STEPHENS FACE (THE PRESENT ONE)

It clearly pains him to look at this photo but he can’t
take his eyes off it We sense a vulnerability in him
that we havent seen before

I thought you were dead

Stephen whirls around to see Ida coming down the hall
toward him He goes to meet her so she doesn’t get near
the display case Instantly he switches from nostalgic
wistfulness to sharp-witted charm

If I was gonna die I’d send out a
press release first
Ida smiles

with one of the interns

IDA
No because your ego’s too big
Youd aim higher

STEPHEN
But youve always turned me down

IDA
Because my egos too big

STEPHEN
How could you aim higher than me

IDA
Well youd head straight to the
top of the list if you told me how
Paul’s meeting with Thompson went

STEPHEN
To get you in bed Itd almost be
worth it

IDA

Almost You have no idea

STEPHEN
I‘1l tell you when I can tell you
But I can’t yet

IDA
You promised me the story Don’t
forget that

STEPHEN
Would I lie Come on let’s get
back to the event

As they walk back down the hall --

IDA
That CNN poll doesn’t look good

STEPHEN
We always expected a slide It’s
all part of being the front-
runner In fact I would’ve been
surprised if our numbers hadnt
started to

EXT KIRKSVILLE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 61

The governor is making his way along a rope line shaking
hands kissing babies Stephen’s just two steps behind
him talking to another reporter

STEPHEN
- Slide a bit There‘’s only so
high you can fly before the other
hawks start pecking away at you
So what we’re seeing now is --

MAN (0S)
STEVE

We switch to --

STEPHENS POV

as he looks around to see who yelled out his name in the
sea of faces

WOMAN (0S)
OVER HERE

And he zones in on two faces A middle-aged couple are
making their way to him Theyre dressed plainly heavy
coats and faded jeans like many of the farmers attending
the rally This is GEORGE and FRAN MYERS Stephen’s
parents Steve wants to flee but it’s too late

Theyre standing eye-to-eye now

ANOTHER ANGLE

FRAN
(hugging Steve)
It’s good to see you son

STEPHEN
You too Ma Wasn’t sure if Id
run into you all I know the
Governors not exactly your cup of
tea

FRAN
We came because we thought you
might be here

GEORGE
How long you been in the state

STEPHEN
Couple weeks now

GEORGE
(furrows his brow)
I see
STEPHEN
Yeah Im sorry I havent called
It’s just been -- you know -- so

crazy and everything

FRAN
Well you have time to come over
for some lunch

STEPHEN
I wish I did but we got two more
events today and I gotta head
right back to the office after
SO

FRAN
Well if today’s no good we can
drive into Des Moines sometime
this week go out to a restaurant
or somethin’

GEORGE
Our treat

STEPHEN
That sounds great but this next
week -- it’s gonna be insane and
I‘d hate to have you drive all
that way if I’m gonna be -- I
mean you know -- if I’m gonna be

tied up

This clearly hurts his mother to the core but she bites
her lip and nods We can see George’s eyes filling with

anger

GEORGE
Well we don’t wanna be a nuisance
to ya

STEPHEN
No no no -- it’s not that at
all

FRAN

Why don’t you just call us if your
schedule frees up okay Even to
just talk on the phone

61
STEPHEN
Alright Ma I’11 do that I’11
call you
GEORGE

(all politeness gone)
Weve heard that before

Fran gives George a reproaching glance Stephen decides
to ignore the comment He gives his mom a kiss on the
cheek

STEPHEN
I better get back to the governor

He holds his hand out to his dad

STEPHEN
Pop

They shake hands coldly Then Stephen spins around and
starts making his way back to the Governor

EXT THE SUV - DAY 62

The Governor is ducking into the back seat Stephen gets
some last-minute briefing in He’s agitated

STEPHEN
You keep to Education today
alright That’s the message and
we don’t wanna dilute it

GOV MORRIS
But these folks wanna talk
ethanol

STEPHEN
I know but we have to stay
focused You can talk about
ethanol just don’t dwell on it

GOV MORRIS
Is it okay I’m wearing boxers Or
should I be wearing briefs

STEPHEN
(curt and annoyed)
Can we be serious about this

GOV MORRIS
What‘s up your ass

62

STEPHEN
Nothing I’m sorry I‘1ll see you
in the next town

He shuts the Governors door

INT THE BUS - A LITTLE LATER 63

Stephen is sitting up front staring out the window as
they exit the town He looks grim Ben settles into the
seat next to him He’s holding several sheets of paper

BEN
Hey man

STEPHEN
(without turning)
Piece of shit isn’t it

BEN
What is
STEPHEN
This town
BEN
Seems like all the rest weve been
to
STEPHEN
Exactly

Ben isn’t sure what Steve’s talking about Decides not
topry Lets a moment pass

BEN
Steve

STEPHEN
Yeah

Ben tries to hand him the sheets of paper

BEN
I was wondering if you’d take a
look at this Maybe show it to
Paul when you get the chance
Its uh it’s this thing I
wrote -- a new speech for the
Governor -- and I thought --

Steve continues to stare out the window

63
STEPHEN
Not now Ben
BEN
But I just --
STEPHEN

I said not now

Ben is disappointed But there’s no sense in pushing the
issue He folds the papers and places them in his lap
We switch to --

STEVES POV

as he sees the large “Welcome to Kirksville” sign with
the map of all fifty states and the star marking
Kirksville’s location

CUT BACK TO

HIS FACE

We see the glimmer of an idea

INT HOTEL FORT DES MOINES - BAR - NIGHT 64

Paul and Ray are sitting at the far end of the bar
Stephen enters and approaches looking weary

STEPHEN
Sorry I just got back

PAUL
Take a seat

Stephen does They talk in hushed tones The mood is
conspiratorial

PAUL
Ray

RAY
I was just telling Paul that if
the internals Duffy showed you are
accurate then it’s pretty much
impossible for us to lose the gap
between now and game day My
tracks show --

The Bartender approaches Ray abruptly stops talking

( )
63
64 64

BARTENDER
(to Stephen)
Anything I can get you

STEPHEN
I’m good

BARTENDER
Alright then
The Bartender walks away Ray waits until he’s at the

other end of the bar before he starts up again

RAY
My tracks show the slide
accelerating and wed have to
pick two or three points a day
just to keep things even I don’t
see that happening

PAUL
to Stephen)
Weve exhausted all our oppo

STEPHEN
Pretty much I mean we’ve got
small stuff but nothing that
would knock him down ten points

PAUL
Abrams and Landau wanna throw half
our budget into ad-buys and I’m
not in a position with Gus to
fight them on it That takes the
legs off of our ground game

STEPHEN
Well I put some thought into this
on the ride back and I think I’ve
got a solution

PAUL
Shoot

STEPHEN
We pull out of Iowa all together
Close up shop Concede the state
That way we lower expectations
prime the media for a loss

PAUL

I think I see where youre
goin’

64

STEPHEN
We say were running a fifty-state
race and were not gonna neglect
the other forty-nine just because
Iowa’s caucus comes first Pour
all our money into New Hampshire
and Super Tuesday states We lose
Iowa but we got a fighting chance
in the next two rounds And it’s
the last thing Duffy will be
expecting

PAUL
(to Ray)
What do you think

RAY
Were still polling ahead by close
to double digits in New Hampshire
and over half of the Super Tuesday
states We’ll take a hit in those
numbers when we lose Iowa but we
might be able to sustain a lead

PAUL
I‘d have to go over Gus’ head for
this Straight to the Governor

STEPHEN
I think it’s the only chance we
got

PAUL

Alright I’11 bring it up with
the Governor tomorrow May lose
my fuckin’ job but hey
(raises his Diet
Coke)
You only live once right

He clinks glasses with Ray Despite his weariness
Stephen looks excited for the first time all day The
game is on

STEPHEN’S ROOM - LATER 65

Steve is sound asleep in bed There’s a ferocious
pounding on his door He sits up groggy

STEPHEN
Alright I’m coming

He doesn’t bother to get dressed Heads to the door and
looks through the eyehole We see --

HIS POV

-- bubble-faced version of a very distraught Ben
Steve opens the door

BACK TO SCENE

STEPHEN

Ben waves a small stack of papers

BEN
The press clips just came in
It’s Thompson He’s endorsing
Pullman today

STEPHEN
(wearily)
Alright round everybody up I’1ll

INT HEADQUARTERS - THE PRESS SHOP A HALF-HOUR LATER 66

Everybody is dressed casually THROUGH the window we can

PAUL
You don’t fuckin’ get it man I

bullshit with the Governor You
think he’s gonna give two goddamns
about my advice I’11 be lucky if

STEPHEN
So you’re just gonna throw in the
towel

Paul stops and glares at Steve

Paul rubs

STEPHEN

Paul -- the Governor’1ll listen to
you I mean we were a fuckin’
long shot when we started Nobody
thought we had a chance in hell
But you made us front-runners
Yeah -- some shit is startin’ to
hit the fan but Jesus Christ

his eyes Lets this moment sink in He’s seen

this before -- the unraveling -- and he knows it isn’t

pretty

A vodka tonic would be good right

STEPHEN

Paul digs into his pocket takes out a few bills

STEPHEN

After the avail okay
Then Ida comes up to him

IDA
You fucked me over

STEPHEN
Let’s talk about this outside

CUT TO

INT HOTEL FORT DES MOINES - UPSTAIRS LOBBY
Ida‘s livid Stephen’s trying to prevent a scene

IDA
I told my editor Id get a scoop
about Thompson going with you
guys then he chews me out when
the Pullman endorsement hits the
wires You made me look like an
amateur

STEPHEN
Okay look -

IDA
Did you know about this

STEPHEN
Pauls meeting didn’t go as well
as we thought it would

IDA
So you did know

STEPHEN
My hands were tied Paul didn’t
want me to tell a soul How can I
make it up to you

Ida’s suddenly very cool-headed
IDA
You can tell me about your meeting
with Tom Duffy

Stephens completely taken aback but doesn’t betray it

i

STEPHEN
Who told you that
IDA
A little bird
STEPHEN
I‘m not fucking around here
IDA
Neither am I
STEPHEN

You dont have shit

IDA
This is a story Steve

STEPHEN
One anonymous source
Uncorroborated The Times will
never print it

IDA
I can‘t get it printed in the
Times but there’s always Matt
Drudge or Roll Call

STEPHEN
Is that some sort of threat

IDA
All I’m saying is that you’ve got
a choice You tell me what
happened with Duffy and I bury it
or the story shows up in a blurb
somewhere I just wanna be in the
loop

Stephen laughs But he’s not amused

IDA
Tell me what happened with Duffy

STEPHEN
You’re supposed to be my friend
Ida You’d stab me in the back
like this You’d ruin my
reputation just so you --

IDA
Wait wait wait -- is that what
you thought That we were
friends Let’s get real here
(MORE)

70
IDA (CONTD)
The only reason you ever gave half
a shit about me was because I work
for the Times Not because I was
your friend You give me what I
want I write better stories
Don’t pretend it’s anything more
than that

STEPHEN
You’re not gettin’ shit from me

He starts to walk away She calls out to him

IDA
Do you really want this story
getting out

Stephen stops

STEPHEN
Lower your goddamn voice
(returning)
Do you realize what a story like
this could do to me

IDA
Of course I do Thats why I’m
giving you a choice

STEPHEN
I could get fired

IDA
So it’s not a difficult choice
then is it

Stephens stymied He doesn’t know what to say

IDA
I’ve got to file by four Make up
your mind by then

And she’s off back into the press avail Steve watches
her go then whips out his cell phone and starts darting
down the stairs

misses This doesn’t faze him He keeps on gunning it
Suddenly sees what he’s looking for and screeches to a
halt

EXT SUBURBAN STREET - DAY 76

STEPHEN

MOLLY

All sorts of stuff How dirty

‘S CAR - A LITTLE LATER

Stephen and Molly are parked in a strip mall

MOLLY
You only met with him right

STEPHEN
Thats enough believe me

MOLLY
I don’t see what the big deal is

STEPHEN
It looks like backroom politicking
-- which is what it was I guess
Morris’ Press Secretary meets with
the Pullman’s Campaign Manager
The reporters will have a heydey
We go off message My staff
starts doubting me Morale takes
a nose dive And we can’t afford
that now -- not with all that’s
happening I mean Molly -- this
race -- we’re not gonna win Iowa
Well be lucky if we don’t tank in
New Hampshire too

MOLLY
(dejected)
You really think were gonna lose

STEPHEN
Iowa Yeah Everything Duffy
said seems to be on target

MOLLY
Not just Iowa I mean the
nomination

STEPHEN
I don’t know It doesn’t look
good

cUT TO

78

His cell phone rings He looks at the number

MOLLY
Who is it

STEPHEN
Ida
(glances at his
watch)
It’s filing time

He lets it ring

MOLLY

Steve bites his lip He knows what he’s got to do

STEPHEN
Ill drop you back at the office

And he starts up the engine

INT HOTEL FORT DES MOINES - BAR 79

Paul is sitting in front of a full tumbler of whiskey
staring at it Its barely cocktail hour and there’s
only a few other people in the bar In the bg we can
see Stephen walking through the lobby on his way to the
elevator but he glances to the side and sees Paul
Comes into the bar and takes a seat next to him

STEPHEN
Your phone’s been off I’ve been
looking all over for you

PAUL
I’ve been here

Stephen eyes the drink Paul’s been staring at Paul

keeps gazing down at the tumbler He won’t turn to face
Stephen

79

STEPHEN
You haven’t been

PAUL
No I havent

He slides the drink in front of Steve

STEPHEN
I don’t want it

PAUL
You might

Steves concerned but chalks Paul’s melancholia up to
the rough day the both of them have had

STEPHEN
Things didn’t go well with the
Governor

PAUL

They went fine

STEPHEN
So the 50 state plan is on

PAUL
Not exactly

He pulls a couple folded sheets of paper out of his
jacket hands them to Steve

PAUL
You see this

STEPHEN
What is it

PAUL

Speech Ben wrote

STEPHEN
I think he tried to show it to me
yesterday I didnt have time to
go over it

PAUL
Its good Has just the right
message Perfect for the position
were in right now

Paul’s acting weird Steve knows it’s risky bringing up
bad news when Paul’s in a mood like this but he knows he
doesn’t have a choice

CON

TINUED

STEPHEN
Look Paul -- Ida knows about my
meeting with Duffy I’m not sure
how she found out but she knows
and it’s gonna hit the wires
tomorrow morning So I wanted to
ask your advice I could just
deny the whole thing but if Duffy
admits to it that could look
worse If I say no comment they
wont let up Or I could own up
to it and try to spin it a way
that makes Duffy look bad What
do you think I should do

Paul turns to Steve

PAUL
I leaked it to her
STEPHEN
(floored)
What
PAUL
It was me I leaked it to Ida
STEPHEN
Why would you do that
PAUL
Because it makes it easier to let
you go
STEPHEN

Hold on You’re not fucking
serious

PAUL
You backed me into a corner
Steve I can’t trust you anymore

STEPHEN
Yeah -- I made a stupid mistake
But then I --

PAUL

You didnt make a mistake You
made a choice The other day
when you phoned me in South
Carolina you said ‘I just got the
weirdest call‘ I asked who
and did you tell me No You
didn’t

(MORE )

PAUL (CONTD)
You said ‘Never mind it’s not
important’ Why Why didn’t you
tell me

STEPHEN
I don’t know

PAUL
You know exactly why Because it
made you feel important Because
it made you feel big that Duffy
would want to speak to you You
thought to yourself -- hey maybe
theres something in this for me

STEPHEN
Look Paul --

PAUL
I‘m sorry It’s over

STEPHEN
You can‘t do this

PAUL
It’s already done I spoke to Gus
about it and he spoke to the
Governor They agree it’s the
right thing to do

STEPHEN
I built the press shop from
nothing When we didn’t have a
dime When it was only me and you
and a couple of interns

PAUL
I know

STEPHEN
Then how can you fire me What
about yesterday -- when you said

we were good That it’s been me
and you from the beginning

PAUL
Please don’t make this harder than
it has to be

STEPHEN
Who the fuck is gonna replace me

PAUL
Ben Until we find somebody else

79

STEPHEN
Ben Hes a fuckin’ baby

PAUL
But I trust him

Now Stephen has really lost it The other patrons are
starting to take notice

STEPHEN
So Im your fall-guy Fire me so
its not your own ass out on the
street

PAUL
Im not gonna let your
carelessness jeopardize this
campaign

STEPHEN
Carelessness Is that what you
were thinking about when you bent
Molly over and fucked her in your
office

Paul doesnt respond It’s pointless to go on

STEPHEN
On top of being a washed up drunk
you gotta be fuckin’ letch too

And Steve’s off Paul digs into his pocket places a few
bills on the counter

PAUL
(to the Bartender)
You can take this away Im not
gonna have it

INT STEVE’S CAR - DUSK 80

Thanks for making it Must be a
busy day for you with the whole -

DUFFY
What’s this about Steve

STEPHEN
I know who leaked the story It
was Paul

DUFFY
You told Paul

STEPHEN
The fucker fired me He’s using
me aS a scapegoat

DUFFY
I’m sorry to hear that

STEPHEN
Anyway I put a lot of thought
into it and I’ve decided I wanna
come work for you

DAN

Because now you’re unemployed
STEPHEN

No - I was gonna resign after I

talked to you Paul just beat me
to it

DUFFY
I don’t think that’s the case

STEPHEN
What‘s the difference As long as
I’m on your team

DUFFY
Because now you’re damaged goods
If you had come to me before Paul
fired you that’d be one thing
But now it just looks like we’re
picking up the scraps Puts
Morris in the drivers seat I
can’t have that

STEPHEN
But I’1l give you everything Our
strategy over the next seven
days

DUFFY
I already got that from Thompson

STEPHEN
Its different now We changed
it

DAN
Youd really do that to the
Governor To Paul

STEPHEN
They dropped me like I was
yesterdays news

DUFFY
Revenge makes people
unpredictable Steve I can’t
have somebody like that on my
staff

STEPHEN
This isn’t about revenge It’s
about working for a winner Like

you said
DUFFY
Im sorry I can’t help you
STEPHEN

freezing but he’s too drunk to care In the bg we can
see the Iowa Capitol building bathed in floodlights He
slips on a patch of ice and falls hitting the ground
hard then sliding halfway down the bank As he fumbles
to climb back up we can see his head is bleeding

He touches his head Feels the blood Clumsily bends
down and picks up some snow packs it and presses it to
the cut on his brow

INT STEPHEN’S ROOM 83

Stephen is shirtless in the bathroom looking at his cut
in the mirror It’s not terribly bad and although the

much good There’s a knock He goes to the door Looks
