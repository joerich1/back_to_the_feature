November 22nd

1 EXT GARDENS CASTLE - DAY 1
From high above we see the castle gardens covered in a

of snow We hear the tread of footsteps then see a beautiful
WOMAN in a fur-lined cloak heading towards an unseen object

ERIC (V0)

Once upon a time in deep winter a Queen

was admiring the falling snow when she saw

a rose blooming in defiance of the cold

The rose looks miraculously red Nearby a RAVEN looks on

Queen gazes at the flower then bends down

ERIC (V0)

Reaching for it she pricked her finger and

three drops of blood fell

BOOM -- with the impact of an artillery shell a DROP OF

lands in the snow Followed by ANOTHER And ANOTHER
The Queen startles then calmly touches her stomach
proud

King

WHITE

ERIC (V0)

And because the red seemed so alive against

the white she thought if only I had a

child as white as snow lips as red as

blood hair as black as a ravens wings and

all with the strength of that rose

A beat then we hear the piercing cry of a new-born baby --

2 INT ROYAL BEDROOM - DAY 2

We find ourselves in a crowded chamber full of MIDWIVES and
PHYSICIANS Moving through the chaos we glimpse buckets of
water dirty sponges astrology charts and protection charms

until we see a BABY GIRL in the arms of her happy mother
ERIC (V0O)

Soon after a daughter was born to the

Queen and was named Snow White

With a radiant smile the Queen offers SNOW WHITE to her
father KING MAGNUS The babys CRIES grow louder as the
cradles her gently in his arms turning towards a mirror
ERIC vO

And she was adored throughout the kingdom

as much for her defiant spirit as for her

beauty

3 EXT WOODS NEAR CASTLE - DAY 3

A wounded MAGPIE is twitching in a puddle of water SNOW

aged 7 now steps towards it hesitantly looking concerned

3 3

YOUNG SNOW WHITE
Pick it up William
Her companion William also 7 braces himself reaches

down

then steps back in alarm as the bird starts flapping wildly
He

tries to cover his embarrassment by sounding knowledgeable

YOUNG WILLIAM

Its dying It doesnt want to be touched

Snow White ignores him approaching the bird herself She
kneels

down hesitates then reaches out and strokes the magpie

calming its flapping before she picks it up

High up on a tree ANOTHER MAGPIE looks on

4 EXT SEASIDE VILLAGE CASTLE BRIDGE - DAY 4

SNOW WHITE runs cupping the wounded bird in her hand
William

dashing after her The sun is out and the fields and forests
are

lit up in all their glory The children sprint through a

BEAUTIFUL SEASIDE VILLAGE -- thatched homes with flower
gardens

HAPPY FARMERS and FAIR VILLAGE MAIDENS --

YOUNG SNOW WHITE

Hurry William Hurry

They run down the dunes waves crashing the sand gleaming
in

the sunlight until they see the BEAUTIFUL CASTLE up ahead -

5 EXT CLOISTER GARDENS CASTLE - DAY 5

A single apple tree stands in the middle of the cloisters
It

stands out Snow White and William dash past it into the
castle

7 INT ROYAL BEDROOM - DAY 7

Snow White bursts into her parents chamber The King and
Queen

turn from the window Two PHYSICIANS are in attendance Snow

White is too young and preoccupied to notice but her
mothers

smile is tinged with sadness and her father looks
heartbroken

YOUNG SNOW WHITE
and

smile

father

We found it in the woods
The Queen takes the wounded magpie from Snow White The King
looks on sadly as she pulls a RIBBON from Snow Whites hair

carefully binds the magpies wing William watches from the
doorway noticing how frail the Queen looks
The magpies flapping gradually calms its pain easing

QUEEN
It will heal in time
Snow Whites eyes are fixed on the little bird

7 7

SNOW WHITE
Ill look after it
The King watches Snow White hiding his sorrow behind a

So does the Queen holding back her tears

QUEEN
You possess a rare beauty my love In
here
(She touches Snow whites heart)
Never lose it Hold it dear You will need
its strength to one day become Queen

8 EXT CLOISTER GARDEN CASTLE - DAY 8

Snow White and William with a small toy bow strapped to his
back climb the branches of the apple tree in the cloister
gardens William picks a DISTINCTIVE RED AND WHITE APPLE and
offers it to Snow White

He makes a point of the offer holding it out nodding

Just as she comes to take it he pulls it away and takes a
huge bite himself grinning Snow White shoves him off the
tree and they fall to the ground

And now we PULL BACK to reveal the King and Williams

faceless

KING MAGNUS
My daughter will need your sons friendship
more than ever Duke Hammond As will I
yours

DUKE HAMMOND
We are here to serve you your Majesty
As the King watches his daughter ERICS VOICEOVER resumes

ERIC (V0)

The next winter was the harshest in memory

and Snow Whites mother passed away

Ba EXT GARDENS CASTLE - DAY 8a

The garden is covered in snow but there is no red rose now

Magnus walks with his arm around Snow white heartbroken
A single tear rolls down Snow Whites cheek Palace

and mourners fixed on her face feeling what she feels
aside

ERIC (V0)

A year went by but the King was
inconsolable Taking advantage of his
grief dark forces gathered on the
kingdoms borders

10 EXT FOREST BATTLEFIELD - DAY 10
From above we see horses movie through the forest and enter

clearing At the head is --
King Magnus with Duke Hammond by his side surrounded by a
line of the Kings Army They are frozen as they look at--
Across the battlefield - Horsemen in a line THE RIDERS are
silhouetted on a misty plain -- a VAST SHADOW ARMY of

warriors
King Magnus and the Duke trade a look -
now

until

veil

DUKE HAMMOND
From what hell comes this army

KING MAGNUS
A hell theyll soon revisit
King Magnus SCREAMS A BLOOD CRY kicks his horse and rides
forward with blind courage no longer caring what happens to
him
The two lines of warriors race pell-mell to the center of
the battlefield When they meet --
Hand to hand combat at its most brutal
King Magnus swings his great sword and a SHADOW WARRIOR

SHATTERS LIKE GLASS

All down the line the same is happening - Shadow Warriors
shattering evaporating

Strange

DUKE HAMMOND shatters an opponent as well and as loud and
furious as the battlefield was only moments before it is

that quiet
The King and the Duke watch in amazement as the rest of the
SHADOW ARMY melts away DISSOLVING INTO THE MORNING MIST

all that is left in the field is --

ERIC (V0)

The unholy army was defeated leaving

King Magnus with the spoils of victory

A CAGED PRISON WAGON Odd Not even sure how it got there
King Magnus moves toward it with a little trepidation When
hes close he gets off his horse walks closer and dares to
look inside

10 10
Inside the cage a WOMAN COWERS her face hidden behind a

King Magnus stares at her through the prison bars then with

mighty blow of his sword shatters the lock and enters
the

angel

KING MAGNUS
You are now free You have nothing to fear
from me
Duke Hammond watches from outside the cage a bit wary as

King kneels beside the terrified woman

KING MAGNUS
What is your name my lady
Slowly the woman turns For a moment the King wonders if

his beloved Queen behind the veil Gently he lifts her

Its not his wife but the most beautiful woman hes ever

RAVENNA
My name is Ravenna sire
The King is speechless now gazing upon the face of an

ERIC (V0)

So struck by her beauty was the King that

he forgot for the first time his broken

heart

His gaze is so intense that Ravenna looks down for a moment
When she lifts her head --

YOUNG RAVENNA - her face reflected in a small hand mirror
Ravenna as a child beautiful but poor looks into the
mirror Her MOTHER a gypsy woman in tattered clothes moves

The young Ravenna looks away distracted by SHOUTS and
COMMOTION outside

11 INT PREPARATION CHAMBER CASTLE - DAY 11

CU - RAVENNAS FACE

Present day Still as a statue and even more beautiful as
cheeks are powdered eyebrows plucked and lips painted by
several sets of HANDS Her eyes stare straight ahead
unblinking her mind elsewhere

Attendants are preparing Ravenna for her wedding to the

SNOW WHITE (0S)

Youre so beautiful

Ravenna snaps to and looks into the face of Snow White
reverential standing a few feet away

Ravennas face softens as she looks at the face of Snow
White Ravenna beckons to her with a look and then holds out
her arm - Come

As Snow White steps forward the handmaidens withdraw until
only one is left weaving beautiful flowers in Ravennas
hair

RAVENNA
That is kind child Especially when it is
said that yours is the face of true beauty
in this kingdom
Snow White doesnt quite know how to answer this

RAVENNA
(A warm smile)
Would you like to be dressed up like this
and married one day
Snow White nods

RAVENNA
I hope youll invite me

YOUNG SNOW WHITE
Of course
Snow White smiles enchanted by her new friend

RAVENNA
I know it is difficult child When I
was your age I too lost my mother

SNOW WHITE
You did

RAVENNA

Yes A King tore me from her arms
dressed me in lace and stole my
innocence

Snow Whites smile dies a bit confused

RAVENNA
I can never take your mothers place but
I feel that you and I are bound
(touches her heart)
I feel it here
Snow White mimics touching her own heart and smiles at
Ravenna It should be a touching moment but something in
Snow Whites face - the way her smile lights up the room -
gives Ravenna pause

12 INT CATHEDRAL - DAY 12

Ravenna in a stunning dresswalks down the center aisle

All

the NOBLES in the land are present

Ravenna looks at them on either side of the aisle They are
all

smiling nodding appreciation But they arent really
looking

at Ravenna She follows their gaze to --

Snow White behind holding the folds of silk from the

wedding dress Snow White looks up adoringly at Ravenna

As the bride and groom reach the altar KING MAGNUS turns
and

smiles the happiest man alive

13 INT ROYAL BEDROOM - NIGHT 13
King Magnus lies on the bed drunk - half with wine and half

with lust His eyes fixed on --

Ravenna in a sheer silk nightgown standing near the
fireplace

holding a goblet Staring a seductive hole through him

She starts slowly toward him never taking her eyes off him

He licks his lips - cant wait for her to arrive

KING MAGNUS
(Gazing at her lustfully)
Who are you

RAVENNA
The bane of Kings
When she does arrive she slowly crawls onto the bed rolls
him on his back straddles him and offers the goblet

RAVENNA
Sup my lord
King Magnus drains the goblet tosses it and gropes her

body

13 13
RAVENNA
Now you are mine
Her eyes gleam in the firelight Magnus tries to playfully
wrestle her off but she grabs his hands and holds him down
firmly
RAVENNA
I will destroy you
KING MAGNUS
(LOVING IT)
Indeed you will
She rips open his shirt then bends down and kisses him on
the

lips He cant believe how good she tastes
RAVENNA
As my people were destroyed As my family
was destroyed As I would have been
destroyed
He is slightly confused by this and his face begins to show
discomfort

RAVENNA
But when a woman stays young forever - no
man can resist her - and the world is hers
He suddenly STARTS TO CHOKE his eyes widening in surprise
As he struggles for breath

KING MAGNUS
What

RAVENNA
First I will take your life my lord Then
I will take your throne
She reaches beneath the sheets pulls out an ORNATE DAGGER
and BRINGS IT DOWN THROUGH HIM --
13a EXT OUTSIDE ROYAL BEDROOM 13a

RAVENNA
Mirror mirror on the wall
Who is the fairest of them all

ERIC (V0)

The spell Ravennas mother placed on her
gave her the ability to steal youth and
beauty and indeed all things good for
her own evil purposes But for every
life there must be a death for every
gain loss and under the reign of
Ravenna nature turned on itself and
people turned on each other

And all this time she kept Snow White in

a cell in the north tower

Ravenna in the shadows sits perfectly still Though its
been years she looks the same The object of her gaze is --
Snow White who has changed She is now a woman lying in a
darkened cell Asleep

Around the corner Finn secretly eyes his sister who

notice him

Ravenna just outside the cell doesnt blink entranced by
Snow White Strange

22 EXT WOODS - DAY 22

A chill wind whips through the woods Lying sprawled on the
ground we see a man (ERIC) who looks like hes dead

Its only as we move closer to his rugged face that we see

empty FLAGON OF GROG by his side and realize hes drunk His
eyes flicker as a WOMANS SCREAM cuts through the woods

FLASH TO
THE SPECTRE OF A WOMAN
SARA beautiful in pain A patch of blood blossoms on her

dress Her mouth is open screaming but no sound comes out

BACK TO SCENE - WE HEAR THE SCREAM

Erics eyes flicker and begin to open -- then he hears it
again

hangover then grabs two THROWING HATCHETS and slides them

his harness on his back --

BROCH turns and sees the huntsman with his hatchet raised

BROCH

BROCH
Aye but first youd have to see straight
Broch advances with a grin drawing his own axe Trying to

his vision and steady his aim Eric hurls the hatchet -- and
MISSES the blade sticking in the tree above the frightened
Gretas head --

Broch is on Eric in an instant swinging his huge battle

Eric narrowly avoids the deadly blows his natural skill and
dexterity slowed down by all the ale hes drunk

13A
25 25
Rose looks on terrified as Broch drives Eric towards the

trees He corners him against an oak and swings his axe --

for Eric to duck at the last moment --
The blade buries itself deep in the tree stuck We realize

from Erics dark smile that he lured Broch into the trap He
draws his second hatchet but instead of using the blade

Broch over the head with the handle knocking him out
Rose looks on in admiration as the huntsman goes through

pockets

tosses her over his shoulders

ERIC

nakedness

The General uses a pointer to make his presentation while
another holds a map

beneath the viscous liquid then she rises like a porcelain
statue

while his handsome son LAIN is unmarked They both stare

her defiantly
Ravenna faces the two rebels A SOLDIER steps forward

SOLDIER
My Queen these two were captured leading

Ravenna seems intrigued steps forward eyeing them

RAVENNA

(TO THOMAS)
Obviously a debt owed to your wife
She reaches out and touches Iains strong jaw He struggles
against the Guards that hold him back

RAVENNA
There was a time I would have lost my heart
to a face like yours -- and you would have

no doubt broken mine

In a flash Iain grabs a Guards dagger and rams it into
Ravennas chest She makes a pained face looks down at the
dagger then up to Iain

RAVENNA
You would kill your Queen
She pulls the dagger out - there is nowound no blood - and
drops it on the ground Iain and Thomas are shocked

33 33

RAVENNA
(admiring to Iain)
You have beauty And courage But how
strong is your heart
She smiles almost regrettably then places her hand on his
chest We hear HIS HEART START TO HAMMER -- LOUDER AND

He grimaces in pain as she SQUEEZES -- the hammering filling

ears -- until his heart finally bursts and he drops dead
Thomas falls to his knees in horror trying to revive his

Finn draws his sword to behead him when Ravenna raises her

No Let him return to the Duke and speak of
the generosity of his Queen

With that she sweeps out followed by Finn Its only now
we see the lines on her face Finn takes her by the arm as
falters

FINN
Are you alright
Ravenna pulls her arm away furiously The General and the
others stare alarmed

RAVENNA

(TO ALL)

They quickly exit all save Finn who watches concerned as
Ravenna leans against the wall for support She pulls
herself together looks at Finn

FINN
Magic comes at a lofty price

RAVENNA
And the expense grows

FINN
You look

RAVENNA
old

FINN
Tired

This is about as much as Ravenna can confess Finn watches
as she walks up the stairs to the mirror chamber Then he
turns and CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE A GUARD appears and Finn
nods

Finn with Rose Ravenna almost smiles

Rose holds her gaze defiantly Ravenna walks over admires
her face smiles then takes her by the throat and --
LIFTS HER OFF HER FEET Rose opens her mouth to scream but
instead of sound ENERGY pours out Ravenna opens her mouth
DEVOURING GRETAS YOUTH AND BEAUTY Like a flower blooming
her lines vanish Like a flower wilting Rose AGES until
shes as old as the scullery maids

Two magpies appear in the window She looks at them and

tell her something She moves toward them
They jump back and up to the edge of the roof that is beside
the cell window hovering there
She is confused but notices --
A roofing nail right where the Magpies hover
Snow White reaches a hand out the window and touches the
loose nail Her fingers move it back and forth as it bit by
bit breaks free

all around her then trips over a root landing face first
A patch of LARGE MUSHROOMS that unleash CLOUDS OF POLLEN
coughs trying to fan the pollen away but its too late
hurries on but the hallucinations come thick and fast now -

The trees look almost human hooded figures peering at her
through the haze She sees owls without eyes Black oil

out of tree trunks A hanging vine reaches down and touches

like a hand and now she runs --
More terrors rage at her from the swirling mist She

again and when she looks up vampire bats scream at her from

staring at him accusingly He has no idea who they are or
hes done wrong Finally he comes before the Queen sizing
up like a tavern beauty

cut him to pieces Eric eyes them then looks to her and in
complete honesty --

ERIC
Do me the favor I beg of you

RAVENNA
So you wish to be reunited with your
beloved
Eric reacts instinctively grabbing her by the throat The
courtiers rise to their feet and the guards draw their
swords but Ravenna holds up her hand

ERIC
My wife is none of your concern
Something about her face the fact that she enjoys his hand
on her throat makes Eric queasy He releases his grip
stares right at Ravenna

RAVENNA
My condolences
Ravenna holds his gaze

RAVENNA
You miss her
His eyes say yes he misses her horribly

RAVENNA
What would you give to bring her back
Eric stares at her curiously

RAVENNA
You know of my powers Bring me the girl

difference between gutting a deer and

honest question -

FINN
Theonly difference between you and I is
I-never found a wife to save my soul

ERIC
Too bad Youll need one
He stops his horse and nods

Pay them no mind
One of the Guards leans over a pool of water to drink when

he
sees a GHOSTLY REFLECTION gazing back at him He stares in
surprise leaning closer Suddenly a BARBED TAIL shoots out
of the water -- skewering him -- and drags him into the
depths
The others turn as they hear a scream but theres no sign of
their companion now just the bubbling water
Only Finn looks unconcerned
Eric stops senses something holds up a hand
Then darts ahead leaving them flat-footed Finn makes a
decision to follow and waves for his Guards to go ahead of
him
They reluctantly follow Eric

66 EXT TREES DARK FOREST - DAY 66
Snow White feels like the whole forest is pursuing her
Running
out of breath she hides in some bushes As she stares into
the

mist she sees a sinister figure appear through the haze

Eric stops and looks around sensing his prey is close Snow

White stays low trying to quieten her breathing

Eric studies the forest floor He sees Snow Whites
footprints

then looks up at an area of disturbed undergrowth

Snow White peers through the bushes and sees the huntsmans

boots approaching She looks around for something to defend

herself with when the sound of the footsteps fades She
cant

GRAB HER BY THE FEET AND DRAG HER OUT OF THE BUSHES

She fights to get away but he pins her with a foot reaches
down and turns her over

FINN

many powers she can take life or sustain
it But she cant bring your wife back
from the dead

ERIC

I WANT HER BACK

His face tells us how much Eric wanted needed to believe
The Guards keep inching toward Eric

Eric still with a knife to Snow Whites throat starts
slowly backing up

Finn pulls his own sword and approaches

Four against one As they burst toward him he tosses Snow
White to the ground and in the same motion throws his knife
into the chest of one of the Guards who crumbles

Eric reaches behind grabs both hatchets and faces off with
the others

They all rush at once Eric fights off the guards as he
raises a hatchet throws it --

Right into Finns chest Just like Ravenna no blood no
wound Finn pulls it out laughs and throws it at the
huntsman who ducks as it sticks into a tree

Snow White terrified races off into the forest They
notice her exit but keep fighting

Eric fights on three sides now - holding his own until Finn
manages to plunge a sword in his side

hurt
Finn struggles to his knees shakes his head hallucinating

Bad odds And hes injured Eric decides in an instant

from the tree and runs after Snow White --

Her face draws him back and he begins to walk toward the

Snow White appears behind and sees --
Eric is walking toward a dark area where several sets of
lupine eyes await
But Eric only sees Sara and he continues to move toward her
She opens her arms to him and steps backwards luring him

as a mighty arm sweeps over him darts between the trolls
legs and hacks at its leg with his hatchets

A swinging stone fist catches him and hurls him across the
creek

HEARTY SOULFUL SINGING Seated among the ruins the dwarves
sing a Celtic ballad as old as time GUS playing the fiddle
Coll and Duir sit away from the others gazing out with the
thousand yard stare of hardened war veterans

COLL
That song takes me back to the battle of
Tylweth Gate A small horde versus an army
Pickaxes against swords and spears

DUIR
Them were the days

(BEAT)
What happened to your quailing cough
Coll shakes his head dunno The two of them smile then

join
in the singing A drunken GORT takes a swig of ale and
staggers
over to GUS
GORT
Play louder you whey-face I can still
hear those harpy fairies
He takes another swig and sings at the top of his voice out
of
tune trying to drown out the humming of the unseen fairies
Snow White and the huntsman look on smiling
ERIC
Legend has it dwarves were created to
uncover all the riches hidden on earth Not
just gold and precious stones but the
beauty in peoples hearts
SNOW WHITE
Really
ERIC
Ask me theyve lost the art if they ever
had it When the Queen seized their mines
she stole their treasure but more than that
she stole their pride
And as if to prove it GORT and NION sing and share from a
flask
of rum before they tumble to the ground-near Muir as the
song

ends Eric notices the tumble and chuckles

GORT
What are you pribbling at longshanks

say anything

MUIR
That seats not taken if thats what you
were about to ask
She sits on the log beside him Gort and Nion eye her

SNOW WHITE
Thank you so much sir

MUIR
Its only a log no need to praise me

SNOW WHITE
No For before For defending me

MUIR
Your father was a good man The kingdom
prospered Our people prospered

SNOW WHITE
There were more of you

MUIR
Aye
And that is all Muir will say on the subject Gort fills in

GORT
One day the group you see before you went
down into the mine for a month long
shift Gus was only a boy When we came
back to the surface nothing The land
was black everything everyone dead
gone We searched but
Gort surprises himself by choking up a bit Muir helps out

MUIR
That was the month your father died

SNOW WHITE
Im so sorry

MUIR
As am I princess As am I
GUS walks over to Snow White

GUS
I know Im a bit spongy to look at Miss
but would you care to dance-with a little
un

SNOW WHITE
Id be honored
Snow White gets up and dances with Gus as the song picks up

Nion and Gort watch her dance with Gus Nions not
impressed leans in to Gort

NION
I dont trust her And I dont believe
in her no matter what Muir says
Gort is still melancholy

GORT
Just you and me do you think there
are any of us left Do you think perhaps
they were merely banished

NION
As long as the Queens in charge well
never know

GORT
Well maybe thats the point isnt it
(beat out of the blue)
I feel funny Queer almost

NION
Queer Since when

GORT
Hows your gout
Nion rubs his leg

NION

Gorts look goes from Nion to Snow White

GORT
You dont think it has anything to do
with

The huntsman drains the last few drops of his rum when BEITH
approaches sitting beside him gruffly

BEITH

ERIC

have abandoned her long ago
Beith eyes Eric as he watches Snow White dance

BEITH

Gus and Snow White are still dancing

GUS
(As Snow White treads on his toes)
You dont mind me saying you got two left
feet for a princess

SNOW WHITE
I dont mind at all Gus I havent danced
in a long long while
She feels eyes on her - turns to see the huntsman watching

with a slight smile She smiles back and breaks away

SNOW WHITE
Do you mind Gus

GUS
Not at all
Snow White walks over to the Huntsman holds out her hand

SNOW WHITE
Youve taught me to fight surely I can
teach you to dance

THE NIGHT SHIMMERS WITH FAIRY LIGHT AS THEY OBSERVE HER
Snow White feels the light on her face and to her surprise

sees the two MAGPIES who watched over her at the castle Two
BEAUTIFUL FAIRIES WITH THE DEER EYES slip out of the

bodies beaming at her
As Snow White sits up they direct her to the woods WHERE A
DAZZLING LIGHT SHINES THROUGH A TREE As she walks animals

in alongside her

A little way away Gus snores in his sleep The golden light
crosses his face and he wakes up As he opens his eyes he
stares in wonder then quickly wakes the other dwarves

They all stare in amazement now even the blind MUIR Eric

the last to wake up wondering what the fuss is all about
They rise and follow to --

She stands BENEATH THE GIANT TREE facing a MAJESTIC WHITE

HART
The air around the mystical creature shimmers with a golden

WILLIAM emerges through the trees to see ALDAN aiming his

The arrow narrowly misses Snow White thudding into a tree

grabs her by the hand

This is what happens when dwarves mix
with men We always come out worse We
have big hearts and well fight for any
cause -- but for what For some new Queen
to call us runts and turn us out of our
homes again

GORT
Ive nothing against the girl but Im
not willing to risk my life for her

Up here its as if nothings changed The
world looks beautiful again

Snow White turns surprised by his words

WILLIAM
The people of this kingdom hate Ravenna
with their very fiber

SNOW WHITE
Its strange but I feel only sorrow
for her
William is taken aback by this but pushes on

WILLIAM

will rise up in your name

make light of them

Thats not how I remember it

fighting And
She trails off lost in his gaze He stops leans closer and
isses her gently They stay like that a moment then

pulls away holding something in his hand Snow White smiles
as she sees that its an APPLE

Snow White just like he did when they were children

Eric goes after her now swinging his twin hatchets The
ravens scream and pluck at his eyes but he hacks at them
fiercely William joining in until the shrieking birds
finally take to the sky and vanish on the horizon

Eric and William rush to Snow Whites side now The dwarves
arrive too hurrying through the snow

William cradles Snow White in his arms trying to revive

but its no use Eric stares in dismay as he sees the poison
drain the color from her lips He kneels down and gazes at
her William turns to the dwarves

desperate now irrational --

glistening

William collapses in prayer the light in Snow Whites eyes
almost gone Eric looks over sees Williams grief is as
great as his own and finally stops fighting

Snow White looks up at William as if she wants to say
something then the light in her eyes goes out

She was my wife princess That was your
question that went unanswered Sara was
her name When I came back from the wars
I carried with me the stench of death and
the anger of the lost I wasnt worth
saving But she did so anyway I loved
reaches

her more than anything or anyone And
then I let her out of my sight and she
was gone and I became myself again A

DUKE HAMMOND
My duty is to protect the people who come

Everyone comes out of their tents and stands beneath Snow
White Her heart pounding she makes her way down the
stairs All are riveted by the sight of her as if theyre
looking on an angel or a living miracle

Eric makes his way back into the courtyard and he too is
stunned as he slides in next to the dwarves in the crowd

BEITH
Its a miracle
Duke Hammond embarrassed and still stunned by the sight of
her walks up the stairs to greet her Several Generals
follow him but stay a few steps below them Hammond takes
her by the hands as they speak

DUKE HAMMOND

There will be no battle your highness
The best thing you can do for your people
is stay safe behind these walls

SNOW WHITE

That is all I thought to do when I
escaped But I have come to learn there
is no peace while others suffer Have you
not learned that

DUKE HAMMOND
The Queen cannot be defeated She cannot
be killed And therefore there can be no
victory

Her voice is gentle but full of quiet conviction

Snow White hesitates her heart pounding then replies

SNOW WHITE
I can vanquish her Defeat her I am the
only one She told me so herself

Duke Hammond starts to object but Snow Whites eyes and

her feet lead her down the stairs to her people When she
reaches the last step - now at their level - she speaks

SNOW WHITE
I have been told that I represent you
that it is my place to inspire you That
is wronct I am not a Queen not a
leader not a warrior

Absolute silence in the courtyard as people lords

hang on her every word

SNOW WHITE
