cooking gear Hallie watches him

all charges have been dropped
- and according to one company source
the AMPCO art department is hard
at work designing a new logo

INT A TV STUDIO - HALLIE - ON THE AIR 259

She is at a news desk Her co-anchor is on her right
Two cameras cover the Live broadcast

HALLIE
As to the whereabouts of Rising
Star
(she pauses) -
Nothing further is known

She begins to collect her papers

HALLIE
So ends the bizarre saga of horse-
vacings’ most honored stallion
And the unusual man who set him
free
(then)
Except for a minor postscript

The co-anchor man looks over abruptly The camera man
covering her checks the clock and is puzzled

HALLIE
Mr Steele will be happy to hear
that his name is not as well known
as it was - even a week ago Signs
fade other faces get pasted over

She looks up from her notes and is suddenly speaking as
though directly to Sonny

HALLIE
Youll have your privacy back
Sonny Your self I wish

(she clears her throat)
( )

HALLIE
I wish I were around to see you
smile at not being recognized
I wish I were around just to

make a little trouble

She searches for the right words

HALLIE
Theres no place Ill ever be
that I wont for just one
Moment see with your eyes

The way I saw those beautiful
high places thac canyon without
a name where Rising Stars run-
ming now And and the way you
showed me me

(she pauses)
I envy the people you talked to
this morning somewhere down the
road Where was it Some some
dusty cafe where they serve candle-
lit donuts I I miss you cowboy
and hope to see you again one day
For now forever wherever you
are good luck Sonny I hope this
finds you well

A STRETCH OF HIGHWAY IN THE SOUTHWEST - EARLY EVENING

The highway rolls as far as the eye can see toward
distant hills Its deserted except for Sonny He
moves along the road a duffel bag over his shoulder

The shadows are long indicating nightfall is not far
off

HALLIES VOICE
(continuing)
This is Hallie Martin in New York
saying Goodnight

CAMERA BEGINS A SLOW PULL AWAY UNTIL Sonny is a tiny
speck lost in the rolling countryside
