THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH WAGER

The town of Presbyterian Church was

born in the early 1890s It was never
conceived it just hsppenedJohn Pudgy
McCabe came to Presbyterian Church in 1695
He died there in 1897 and the town died
three years later

FADE IN
1 ESTABLISHING SHOT PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH 1970 DAY
BEGIN TITLES

THE SITE of what was once Presbyterian Church ANGLE FAVORS
the blackened ruins of the edifice from which the primitive
zinc mining mountain town took its name a small at its
best crude church which at some previous point in history
was burned to the ground We see the charred remains An
entire wall is miraculously intact CAMERA RISES to peek
over the top of the well and sees a green mountain vista

es far es the eye cen see CAMERA BEGINS TO PAN AROUND

It is raining and there is en sura of bitter cold CAMERA
continues its PAN Below the church other buildings
crumbled and sagging sre suggested but not identified
There is NO SOUND Presbyterian Church has died end time
hes all but buried it

2 CAMERA RETURNS TO ORIGINAL POSITION

The town is alive - or rather struggling to survive

The church is as it was at a time when it wes under
construction A tiny rude community sprawls slong a
muddy street below the church It is the town of Presby-
terian Church 1895 WE SEE the kneeling figure of a
man dressed against the foul bitter cold sleet The
weather has survived the seventy-five year transition
The man wears e carpenters apron over his hard clothing
He is MISTER ELLIOTT self-proclaimed minister of
Presbyterian Church end in fact the builder of the
church fromwhich the town took it name It is still
raining when Elliott shivering in the cold completes
his silent prayer rises and walks

ANOTHER ANGLE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH

For a closer look Calling Presbyterian Church a community
is giving it all the best of it There are a few ramshackle
wooden structures on stilts but the town consists mostly
of tents and has been hurriedly thrown up along a main
street which is little more than a muddy bog

There are some mine entrances fronting the main street

but they no longer produce ore and have been converted

into primitive dwellings of a sort A crude sign over

the entrance to one of these abandoned mines reads
SHEEHANS SALOON AND HOTEL NO UNESCORTED WHORES ALLOWED

ANOTHER ANGLE SHEEHANS

As PAT SHEEHAN himself moves out of the former mine shaft and
throws a bucket of God-knows-what out onto the muddy street
nearly drenching a couple of CHINAMEN who are Picking their
way from dry spot to dry spot The Chinamen register their
complaints but Sheehan pays no attention -- as though
dumping garbage on Chinamen was a way of life Sheehan is
filthy and unshaven -- a dirty black Irishman with a dirty
black temper to match He turns ‘and re-enters his saloon
Sheehans in fact actually sums up the amount of growth
Presbyterian Church has so far experienced It began within
the mine shaft the next addition had been a wooden room

used as a bar room Additional space for living quarters

has now been provided by a tent off to one side

ANOTHER ANGLE

FAVORING the Chinese as they move along the street toward
the edge of town and the mines in the beg In the bg the
church dominates the landscape its steeple rising perhaps
sixty feet in the air The SOUNDS of Elliotts carpentering
can be heard

EXT MOUNTAIN TRAIL DAY

This is the trail leading to Presbyterian Church We are in
hard-rock mining country A man on horseback leading 8 pack

horse moves slowly up the trail and steps to gaze at the
church steeple —

ANOTHER ANGLE THE MAN

He is JOHN QUINCY McCABE His is not the face of a miner
mor any man used to this wilderness He wears a long heavy
all-purpose coat against the weather A blanket protects

his head against the sleet His face has not been browned
and leathered by the elements and he seems oddly out of
Place in this rough mining country

WHAT McCABE SEES ©
Presbyterian Church

BACK TO McCABE

as he surveys the town his expression hiding and at the
same time reflecting his thoughts about it If he has any
He sighs in a kind of resignation his breath showing in the
cold as he dismcunts

ANOTHER ANGLE McCABE

The rump of the pack animal is in the fg as McCabe moves
in and begins to search for some articles in his pack The
horse chooses this moment to relieve his bowels perhaps as
an opinion of the muddy trail the rank weather and the —
filthy town McCabe removes his coat and takes off the
blanket from around his head We see that beneath them he
wears a frock’ coat ruffled shirt and a fancy embroidered

’ vest with a gold watch chain strung from pocket to pocket

An impressive hand gun a Navy Colt with an enormous barrel
is holstered at his side He has removed his case set of
soliar and cuffs and begins putting them on It is far too
cold for this outfit but it is apparent McCabe wants this
facade He takes his derby from his pack shudders and
pats himself against the bitter cold his breath issuing
virtual billows of steam He mounts puts on the deby

aS a rakish angle and urges his horse to move out securing
his coilar and his cuffs as he moves up the trail toward
Presbyterian Church

ANOTHER ANGLE

A continuation McCabe rides past the church as Fliiott
steps out engaged in some task He tips his hat but
Wlliott ignores him He continues down into town Except
for the inhospitable Elliott the town seems deserted
Though McCabe is miserable and cold he shows an almost
jaunty facade -- the imperturbable gambler in spades

from within the mines and watch him Some are Chinese most
are Occidental but it is hard to tell one from the other
since they are covered with pale gray zinc dust INTERCUT

INT MINE TUNNEL

By the light of several lanterns inside McCabe sees the
brawny back of a miner the zinc dust caked with sweat on
his shirt as he swings a twelveepound sledge Another
miner holds a steel bit against the rough face of the tunnel
The tlow of the Sledge goes slightly off and the bit is
flung to one side

What he SEES es the CAMERA PANS

“Sheehans” can be seen with Pat Sheehan himself standing
on the front porch craning his neck to see what 1s happening
Qp by the tent Apparently he has no custaners or at
least none are visible Sheehan moves off the porch and
heads in the general direction of McCabes

CAMERA LOSES SHEEHAN and precedes him poking around A
converted sheep-wagon is up on stilts now A sign above
the door identifies it as the ELITE BAKERY Jast now

the ovens of the bakery are ont in the ‘open and a MAN can
be SEEN removing hot bread from en oven and moving toward
the wagon As he does SO and WOMAN emerges from the wagon
with white dough in bread pens and places it in the oven

home of the Elite Bakery

The Government Land and Assay Office has become a permanent
structure Next to it Sandy Mac Arthurs Blacksmith

Shop is being built SANDY himself can be SEEN in the
yard He moves around the side of the building and looks
down toward the stream which runs behind His WIFE is doing

awash Sandy takes the opportunity to take a place in line

52 CAMERA MOVES ON TO SEE that a bridge spanning the river is
under construction its builders probably in line with the
others The Cornish Water Wheel is spinning now pumping
water from a flooded mine into the stream

S53 CAMERA MOVES ON TO LOCATE the Chinese section close to the
stream Their area is still very crude yet on one semi-
tent the MASONIC EMBLEM can be distinguished A Chinaman
is hanging a line of clothes to dry while another is busy
shaving the head of a third

su BACK TO SCENE

McCabe turns back away from the window

Sensing trouble the Chinaman in the near bg grabs the
strongbox and moves across the street

INT MeCABES LIVING QUARTERS

The upstairs is not in much better shape than the lower floor

It has been furnished with a bed A few boxes are scattered
around to serve as chairs A crude bench has been set up in

- front of a mirror McCabe wets his razor in a tin basin A

pot-bellied stove is stage center Near it seated on one of
the boxes is Pat Sheehan

McCabe turns and rushes back to the window looking out

McCABES P0OV

Just in time to see Tiny take a roundhouse swing at Kelly and
Ledbetter missing them both The force of his swing propels
him into the tent knocking it down Kelly and Ledbetter
jump on top of Tiny and more of the tent begins to fall
From inside comes the SCREAMS of the whores and the SOUNDS of
at least three angry men whose pleasure has been interrupted

ANOTHER ANGLE THE FIGHT

It catches on like a forest fire and soon the entire line of
men are fighting one another The six occupants of the tent
(three whores and three tricks) are in various stages They
manage to extricate themselves from the collapsed tent and
they too join in the melee

ANOTHER ANGLE McCABE

as he crosses the street He is fully dressed his Navy
Colt strapped to his side at the ready He walks slowly and
Geliberately to the area near the tent and stands quietly
At first his presence is only felt by a few of those nearest

stops totally When it is quiet and all eyes are on hin
McCabe singles out Tiny and directs his words to him hand
poised over the butt of his gun

with steam Soon a CARRIAGE comes into view and moves down
the street TOWARD CAMERA Although we cant as yet distin-
guish them the occupants of the carriage are the FOUR WHORES

It is utter chaos Two Chinese attendants do their best to
keep some kind of order to no avail The dressing room
built to accommodate perhaps a half-dozen men waiting for
baths is crowded beyond belief Half-naked men and stark-
naked men are everywhere Clothing is strewn about -- just
who it belong to s the question Boots pants shirts
coats and all sorts of filthy foul weather gear are passed
back and forth claimed and reclaimed

In the tub area If possible there is even less order here
One man is bathing clothes and all Some are bathing to-
gether in the four tanks The overflow from the dressing
room has pushed half-dressed men still struggling to rid
themselves of their clothes out onto the catwalks between
the tanks Losing his balance one man pitches into a bath
‘already occupied by two others While voices are often
raised in anger the main purpose of this hasnt been for-
gotten and there is no serious fighting Throughout the
scene SOUND of the Chinese attendants chattering OVER

is seated at a faro table a number of books of the ledger
type are open in front of him His movements and gestures
even the way he tosses off an occasional drink indicate that
columns of figures credits and debits are not his long suit
Danny is behind the bar hard pressed to find something to
do and Hey You is standing idly near to him

DANNY
Be all right to close up Mr
McCabe

McCabe looks up from his books surveys the empty saloon

McCABE
Yeah close up for crissakes
Its going to take me all night
to figure where I am at with
these Goddamn books

Danny slips off his apron and moves toward the door

McCABE
Come on over and have a drink

DANNY
If its all the same to you Mr
McCabe I thought Id get myself
a bath

Mrs Miller walks by him into the saloon

CONSTANCE
Why are you always in such a bad
temper

McCabe closes and locks the inside door of the saloon

McCABE
Por one thing it is because ever
since you came here you have cost
me nothing but money -- This shit
must cease Madame I have not
sold a full bottle of whiskey today
and thats a fact

CONSTANCE
Because every man in town was taking
a bath in your bath house or laying
up with a girl in your whorehouse

McCABE
But I have not seen any of that
money Madame and my books show
that what I need most of all right
now is money

She spots the books moves to the table and ssts down the

We missed a lot of bath money
because of the rush but theres
almost three hundred dollars there

McCabe continues to count out loud makes a mistake starts
over with an impatient glance at Mrs Miller She pours
herself a drink then looks at the open books At first it
is cursory then she peruses them with growing interest
which soon turns to amusement

CONSTANCE

How could you tell

McCabe stops counting exasperated

McCABE
How could I tell what

CONSTANCE
You said your books showed you need
money Id like to know how you
figured that because these books
are impossible

McCABE
Ill thank you to keep out of things
you dont understand

CONSTANCE
Were partners I have a right to
see the books

McCABE
We are not partners in my saloon or
my gambling or my opium business

CONSTANCE
Some business -- opium

McCABE
if it had not been for opium Mrs
High-and-Mighty-Miller there would
be no bath house no whorehouse
and more than likely no saloon
You might remember that

McCabes ledger is prompting these questions

McCABE
Madame I can hold my own in any
game of chance with any amount
you can count I can figure odds
and pay-offs before you can blink
and I can tell you how much the
bartenders are stealing by looking
at the empty bottles -- It takes
me a little longer to write it
down formal

CONSTANCE
From now on Ill Relp you with
the books -- If only to protect
my interest

McCABE
I warn you Madame - dont push
me too far

CONSTANCE
Itll take me a day or two to
reconcile these figures but I
can tell already that you have
more money than you think --
More than enough to begin building

Porch of his saloon and watches the action before turning
back inside

assumption

McCABE

THE LAWYER
Wise -- Before I take the ease I
want you to tell me why you want to
fight Dont give me any bullshit
and I wont give you any -- You
wouldntve come here if you didnt
want to fight them

McCABE
T dont know really -- I guess
its my time

bis lips probing testing to see if McCabe is the right man

McCabe shrugs signs the paper hands it back

“ THE LAWYER
(continuing)

All right Trick is to enter every-
thing into sane kind of record Well
take out warrants against the Company
for coercion Well file in district
court and well lose Then we will

appeal and start all over again Think
Im a fool

McCABE
I couldnt make no judgement on that
It does seem like a waste of time

LAWYER
Right Mans a goddamn fool to believe
that justice is the business of the law

LAWYER (Cont )

Law uses rules to make society orderly

comes out of that sometimes it doesnt
Know who the real villain is Not the

somebody to stand up - fight them to
a standstill

changed positions all day The cigar in his mouth has gone
out Danny moves away from the window suddenly looking as
if he is ready to wet his pants

DANNY
Theyre coming

McCabe picks up the shotgun and COCKS it Danny stands
right in the line of fire

McCABE
Move away Danny -- behind the
bar Dont let yourself get
between them and me

DANNY
I dont mind saying Im scared
to death

McCabe doesnt anawer Sitting there with a shotgun pointed
at the door seems enough SOUNDS of boots on the steps
before the batewing doors swing wide open

Doc BUTLER the leader is a big white-haired man of
aixty-plus He has killed many times and enjoyed it His
eyes move very fast and miss nothing Thumbs hooked in his
belt sleeves rolled up revealing enormous arms He is
unarmed

BREED of either Mexican or Indian descent Hes dressed

almost identically to Butler Hes wolf lean dangerous

He too is unarmed He stands just to the left and a pace
behind Butler

Next to him KID stands About eighteen he probably

hasnt killed yet and is looking forward to it His clothes
ie new and clean and he wears two six-guns strapped to his
egs

Patrick Sheehan brings up the rear

‘Butler walks directly toward McCabe Breed at his side Kid

moves to the far end of the bar sweating a lot

hammer of the shotgun Butler stands about six feet from

He was the greatest man alive

McCABE
Bullshit Roundtree was from

McCabe and Butler size each otherup while Kid brings the

dottle and two glasses pouring Breeds drink first When
he pours for Butler the old killer takes the bottle from

him Kid returns to the bar es before

ANOTHER ANGLE

Butler swallows his glass of whiskey all at once pours
another and takes a step nearer McCabe to set the bottle
on the Faro table McCabe brings his shotgun up sharply --
to Butlers further amusement

McCABE
You dont have no notion that the
second drinks on credit do you

BUTLER

Butler seems to really be getting a kick out of McCabe
When he recovers from this latest knee-slapper

BUTLER

McCABE

Danny -- Give Mr Butler one of
my cigars

While Butler turns his back on McCabe and walks toward the
bar he keeps his eyes on him in the mirror McCabes

‘shotgun follows him unerringly Butler takes a cigar and

lights it

teating McCabe and when he tenses Butler pulls the chair

back and ‘sits in it heavily

He blows cigar smoke in the air and begins to recite

BUTLER

They both smile nodding their approval Butler stands up
and leans over the table disregarding the shotgun that has
tracked him

BUTLER

(continuing)
Well I aint like that Pudgy I
like to kill Wolves and buffaloes
and antelopes and Indians and men
You know what I do when Im out
on the prairie and there aint
nothing in sight to kill

McCABE
I wouldnt have no idea

BUTLER
Why I wait until one of them prairie
dogs sticks his head up and then I
splatter that head all over the prairie
I waited a whole afternoon once

(beat)
T wait with him

Butler laughs rewarding Breed with his approval The Kid
is unsure whether to laugh or not

MeCABE
Any of them prairie dogs ever shoot
back

Butler laughs again pours another drink tosses it off and
sets down the glass

BUTLER
We aint paying for these drinks
Pudgy

He moves away again toward the bar past the Kid who steps
out between Sutier and McCabe McCabe moves ouickly away
from the table to an angle where Butler cant escape the
shotguns blast Danny ducks behind the bar Butler sees

McCabe moves his shotgun off the Kid and points it directly

at Butler

McCABE
If this young man hawks up another
Im going to give you a new asshole

Butler thinks about it briefly before he moves over and puts
his arm around the kid

BUTLER
That rifle of mine shoots eight
hundred yards Kid Let McCabe

The two miners have reached a spot just about parallel with

out leaving his companion in the street He hears them
laughing down at Sheehans and realizing that its just a
prank moves to pick up the hats They have fallen near one
another in the street But es the miner reaches to retrieve

bottle in mid-air

Several small boys and a few men are watching from the
livery stable very much impressed with Kid

Now he picks up a can throwing it up in the air drawing
and hitting it as before except that this time his bullet
has sent the can soaring higher In the bg Breed sees

even higher -- only to be topped by Butler who hits the
can squarely with a bullet from his Sharps sending it
higher still And the procedure is repeated

It is still raining McCabe stands at the window looking out
toward hia saloon thoughtfully Hes fully dressed including
slicker and carries his shotgun Behind him Mrs Miller is
asleep on the bed He turns and looks at her for a time
then opens the door and steps out into the rain CAMERA
TRUCKS with McCabe as he moves carefully down the ‘steps
ducking under them when he gets to the bottom and looking
tntently through the rain toward his saloon He stares for
ae time trying to determine if everything is as he had
eft it

232 P0¥ M6CABES

Through the steps CAMERA ts McCabes eyes A light shines
behind the shade in his bedroom Other lights have been lert
burning within the saloon No movement can be seen behind
any of the windows CAMERA searches for signs of ambush and
finds nothing

233 ANGLE McCABE

Moving out and toward the foot bridge its wetness reflecting
the tiny amount of light from the salocn McCabe decides not
to use it and he slides down the side of the muddy ditch
fLllling now from the steady rain and scrambles up the bank
on the other side

ANOTHER ANGLE

McCabe runs silently to the dark wall between the office door
and the stairway leading to his vedroom He stops there and
stares up toward his bedroom door trying to look through it
Finally he moves to the stairway but stops just short of
stepping up to move around on the ground and check the STEP
he had raised the other day It has been depressed The
weight of something has forced it almost back to the steps
original position McCabe moves away back to the steps

between watching the door for McCabes entrance -- and watch-
ing himself in the mirror above the bar OF BREED standing
to one side of the office window shotgun pointed toward the
door OF BUTLER seated on McCabes bed the long Sharps
between his legs its butt resting on the floor

THE DITCH
As McCabe moves away from the saloon the towns main bridge

Out of breath feeling hunted he leans back against the door
listening for the slightest sound of danger Wothing Wow

ANOTHER ANGLE

Elliotts church is nothing more than a shell a facade
There ts no floor no pews no pulpit Absolutely barren
except for aladder The ground has not even been cleared
Stumps and boulders are still there and in one corner a
messy area can be seen where Elliott sleeps McCabe moves
to the ladder and looks up

P0V MoCABESS ©
The ladder leads to the bell tower

BACK TO SCENE

If McCabe has thoughts about Elliotts church they will have
to be examined later He starts to climb the ladder but

finds it impossible to negotiate carrying the cumbersome shot-
gun He leans it against the bottom of the ladder and climbs

BELL TOWER

The highest point in the town of Presbyterian Church From
here McCabe can see the town as he has never before seen it

P0V°McCABES WHAT HE SEES

His saloon and the other buildings along Main Street are
facing him Across from them the abandoned mines the
government building at the far end Sheehans saloon can
be seen across the pond at one end of Main Street Following
along the back street up from Sheehans he sees the livery
stable a few dwellings and shops the rear of Mrs Millers
house separated from McCabes by the ditch The bath
house the mines beyond it and the shacks of the Chinese

“section down the slope There 1s no movement of any kind

Without a word Breed steps to the center of the room and
fires his SHOTGUN into the mirror destroying it Kid
following his lead puts on a brilliant SHOOTING exhibition
using the bottles on the back bar for his targets Butler
sits calmly watching them as they systematically shoot up
and destroy John Q McCabes

EXT BELL TOWER McCABE

Listens stoically as his place is shot to pieces When ths
firing stops McCabe looks down toward his saloon

P0V McCABES

Hes too high up to hear but Butlers gestures make it plain
that they are splitting the town up between them for the
search Butler and Breed leave Kid on Main Street and walk
across the bridge splitting up on the other side of it
Breed will begin his search at Mrs Millers and that whole
street and Butler apparently will begin his in the Chinese
section

Hes looking in the direction of Kid calculating the risks
of getting him first He makes up his mind and steps down
onto the ladder

BOOM SHOT WITH McCABE

as he climbs down the ladder and into the eerie hollowness
of the church itself He reaches the bottom and reaches
around for the shotgun

ANOTHER ANGLE CLOSER

McCabe crouches down feeling the dirt floor to see if it has
fallen He cant find it His face clouds exvression
puzzled He rises CAMERA MOVING WITHHIM As McCabe turns
away from the ladder ANGLE WIDENS TO REVEAL the SHOTGUN
held by someone unseen It is pointed directly into McCabes
face about three inches awey McCabe cannot tear his eyes
from the yawning holes of the double-barrelied shotgun
‘MoCabes life begins to flash in front of him When we can
no longer stand it and the gun is not fired nor a word
spoken McCabe raises his eyes

MoCABE
Give me that shotgun you bible-
back son-of-a-bitch What the hell

258 ANOTHER ANGLE

To see that Elliott is holding the shotgun - and wanting to
pull the trigger He doesnt relinquish it

McCABE
Listen Elliott I need that gun
Those men will kill me if I dont
have that gun I mean it I cant
get close enough to them if I dont
have that gun Godammit what are

Elliott pushes the shotgun closer to McCabe who moves back
against the wall

259 ANGLE ON McCABE
Shotgun barrel in the fg

McCABE

If you pull that trigger its going
to bring this fight right in here

Por crissakes Elliott give me the gun

260 - ANOTHER ANGLE

Elliott pushes the barrel into McCabes face forcing him
toward the door When both men have moved near it Elliott
gestures with the shotgun for McCabe to leave

McCABE
This is the same as klliing me
I cant go up against them without
the gun Its murder Thats a

Bineee

260 (Cont)

The next gesture Elliott makes with the gun is one that con-
vinces McCabe that he better leave while he can Hoe makes

a gesture with his hands as if warding off something turns
and exits quickly

CLOSE ELLIOTT

as he raises his eyes toward heaven with great triumph

EXT CHURCH

McCabe allows himself a moment of great relief but only a
moment His slicker makes too much noise now that the rain
has diminished some He shucks it off moves to the corner
of the church and takes his gun from his holster He looks
at it for a beat the hand gun is all he has

WIDE ANGLE

McCabe peeks around the corner and looks down the street
toward Kid whose back is to McCabe as he stands peering
between two buildings having moved only scant yards from
where we last saw him McCabe carefully sights his Colt in
Kids direction

CLOSER ANGLE McCABE

He would like to put a bullet in the kids back but the
distance is too great He looks 08 ‘toward the corner of
the bridge

WIDE ANGIE

Kid doesnt turn around as McCabe is seen in the far bg
running across the street to gain the cover of the bridge
Kid moves off down the street a few paces

ANGLE McCABE

Again he has sighted Kids back but the few paces he has

moved down the street again increased the distance too much
for a shot

ANGLE McCABE

Realizing that he must again close the distance between them
He looks long at the Kid trying to anticipate his moves

ANGLE KID

His guns are drawn and he nervously cocks and re-cocks them

ANGLE McCABE

It is the SOUND of the guns being cocked that helps McCabe
make up his mind to try and cross behind him

WITH KID

Standing still now watching cocking and re-cocking tensed
to spin around at the slightest sound Behind him McCabe
runs from the cover of the bridge trying to cover the SOUND
of the md sucking at his boots by timing his steps to the
SOUND of the Kids fiddling with his guns When McCabe takes
one too many steps and the SOUND of the md sucking after his
boots is startling Kid hears it He cocks both his guns
but theres a moment when the Kid is afraid to turn around --
and afraid not to

WIDE ANGLE

McCabe has his gun out at arms length in front of him When
he cocks it the SOUND triggers Kid into spinning around

fie his eyes dont find McCabe in the rain before McCabe
fires

ANGLE KID
Hit in the stomach by McCabes bullet He falls backward

peatedly to get back up

slowly toward it

“INT BARBER SHOP McCABE

He has lost an enormous amount of blood It drips steadily
on the floor beneath the barber chair where he is still
seated Outside the day is very gray without suniight and
McCabe can see the fire of Elliotts church reflected in

causes McCabe to spin the chair around

Butler cant see him well enough to fire again and runs off
the bridge toward him

‘ANOTHER ANGLE “

Butler runs to the spot where McCabe pitched into the ditch
Nearing the edge he keeps his rifle ready but looking down
decides it isnt necessary Patrick Sheehan appears on the
bridge in the bg and runs toward the ditch when Butler
sets down the Sharps

as he steps down into the ditch laughing He turns McCabe
over in the ditch so he can reach the pocket where he knows
the money is Butler sees the instrument of his death a
moment before it kills him The sleeve of McCabes right
arm has concealed until now a tiny derringer held in a
device often used by gamblers The bullet from it enters

amile on his face
