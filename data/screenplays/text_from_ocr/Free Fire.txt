EXT BOSTON

We see an aerial shot of Boston The sound of WAAB-FM burbles
over the top We hear about local events rock concerts
films We see a red 75’ Chevy Van stuck in traffic

Title May 13 1978 Boston

EXT STREET ABANDONED FACTORY DAY

A blue 72 Plymouth Fury is parked up by a battered looking
warehouse There are three people inside A woman and a man
in the front a man in the back

After a beat she turns

CHRIS

Frank looks out of the window and pulls a filter-less Camel
from its pack

FRANK
Do you like this place

JUSTINE
Boston

FRANK
America

There’s a pause It’s as if she’s never considered it

JUSTINE
Sure

She isn’t giving anything away from behind her sunglasses
Frank smiles and lights up He wants to go home He watches a
stray dog nosing around in some rubbish

INT RED CHEVY DAY

Inside Stevo 28 Long hair wide ‘Apocalypse Now’
moustache T-shirt jacket and jeans He has a black eye He
talks in a Boston accent Bernie is his heavy lidded side
kick

Bernie is driving Stevo is holding his head in his hands

STEVO
My fucking head

BERNIE
I told you not to mix your
drinks

STEVO
I feel like my brain is trying to
crawl out of my eyes

BERNIE
Every time I tell you

STEVO
Have you got any headache pills

Pause Bernie looks sideways at Stevo
BERNIE
No I’ve got some smack though

Bernie shrugs apologetically A sledgehammer to crack a nut
STEVO
I didn’t think you were doing that
shit anymore
Stevo is mock worried
BERNIE
Just at the weekends It’s for
unwinding I’ve got a very

stressful life

Stevo sits there for five seconds His head pounding like a
bass drum

STEVO
Okay maybe a little

Bernie smirks and hands Stevo a small wrap of heroin

BERNIE
When will we finish today

Stevo carefully opens the wrap

BERNIE (CONT’D)
Careful

STEVO
Hour and a half tops They do the
deal and we help load up the

crates
BERNIE
And there’s guns in the crates
STEVO
Yes guns You don’t get paid 100
for moving cans of beans
BERNIE
I can’t get in any trouble Stevo
I
STEVO

You should have thought about that
before you punched that guy in
Harlequins last night

BERNIE
I was provoked

STEVO
Look in my eyes
BERNIE
I hate it when you do that It
means you are bullshitting me

STEVO
Look in my eyes

Bernie pushes Stevo away

BERNIE
I am driving

Stevo decants a little of the Heroin into a burnt bit of tin
foil

STEVO
I love you man I would never let
anything happen to you

Stevo lights up his zippo under the tin foil
BERNIE
HA HA Now you have totally fucking
cursed me
STEVO
Dont worry man SNIFFFF What
can go wrong

He passes back the wrap

Bernie smiles and Stevo drifts on a warm cloud of morphia

EXT STREET

The van pulls up behind the Plymouth Stevo gets out Frank
has already got out to meet him He walks over to the man and
drags him back to the van We cut in close now and see

FRANK
Where have the fuck have you been

STEVO
I’m sorry Frank

FRANK
If you say traffic I’m going to
punch you in the throat
Stevo looks at Frank
STEVO
There was a density of cars that

slowed my egress

Frank pauses
FRANK
Are you on drugs
STEVO
No
Frank starts again
FRANK

Don’t lie to me you little fuck
Are you high

STEVO
No sir

INT CAR DAY

Chris sees that Justine is watching Frank talking to the
boys

CHRIS
He’s just a bit on edge

JUSTINE
-and he’s meant to be looking
after you

CHRIS
Sure Do you think that’s the
dynamic I’m meant to be making
sure he doesn’t get into trouble
I’m a calming influence

We hear a bump as Frank slams Stevo up against the van

EXT VAN

Frank knocks on the van window It winds down Bernie peeks
out

FRANK
Hey Bernard

BERNIE
Hey Frank

FRANK
Is he on drugs

Bernie thinks for a moment His face a mask of control
BERNIE

Hey I am no rat But he has taken
some medication for a migrane

Frank turns to Stevo and steps up close He looks him in the
eyes

FRANK
I know you don’t really understand
how serious I am What

STEVO
I do Frank

FRANK
--l am talking
What my capacity to hold a grudge
isbecause nothing bad has
happened to you has it

STEVO
No

Stevo is agreeing to agree here Though he does it poorly and
Frank reads him

FRANK
Your Grandmother dieing of cancer
aged 95 does not count

STEVO

You don’t know anything about me
FRANK

Is that supposed to reassure me
STEVO

Well
FRANK

You are made of glass to me Steven

Frank grabs Stevo by the balls His fist crushing them
through the denim

FRANK (CONTD)
Does that focus your mind

STEVO
Fuuuuck

FRANK
I’m holding your brain in my hand
now ain’t I
You ever going to be late for me
again

STEVO
No

Frank looks round and sees Bernie watching him
FRANK
Bernard If you want some just
say I’ll open you up like a tin of
beans

Bernie mulls this for a nano-second

BERNIE
You are good Frank

FRANK
I promised my sister that Id bring
you home in one piece You are not
going to make a cunt of me are you

STEVO
No

Frank lets go of Stevo’s balls and he staggers back Franks’
manner has changed He is matter of fact

FRANK
Why have you got a black eye

STEVO
Walked into a door

Frank doesnt move Stevo becomes uncomfortable

STEVO (CONT’D)
What are you doing Stop that

Frank stares into his soul

INT PLYMOUTH DAY

CHRIS

You ever wonder where the guns go
JUSTINE

No
CHRIS

You are not curious

JUSTINE
What are you doing Trying to rub
my nose in it

CHRIS
I just wonder what you are doing

JUSTINE

woman

CHRIS

Justine smiles

JUSTINE
Oh I see okay
CHRIS

JUSTINE

This The humiliation routine

CHRIS
I don’t follow

JUSTINE
You’re going to tell me all about
the horrors of your life while
trying to get into my underwear
That kind of thing

Chris thinks

CHRIS
Yeah - I usually lead with the
horrors then the looking haunted
then a bit of eye contact

JUSTINE
And this works

CHRIS
Sure

JUSTINE

Show me your haunted
Chris does haunted

JUSTINE (CONTD)

CHRIS
What are you doing later

JUSTINE
Picking up my kid Cooking dinner
Not hanging out with terrorists

CHRIS
I’m not a terrorist

Chris looks sad

JUSTINE
Sorry Stop That’s part of it

Chris drops the sad look and smiles Justine lights a
cigarette

CHRIS
You dangerous are you Mysterious
international gun dealing lady

JUSTINE
Yup

Justine puffs on her cigarette Frank gets into the car
followed by Stevo

Chris looks at Stevo’s black eye Frank looks at Stevo’s eye
in the mirror He purses his lips Chris points at the black
eye using the minimum of effort

CHRIS
Did you win

STEVO
I walked into a door

Chris smiles tightly Stevo is a clown

CHRIS
Where did you get him from Frank

Stevo reacts hurt He shrugs
STEVO
Talk to me if you’re talking about

me

Chris and Frank ignore Stevo

FRANK
My sisters husband She’s got a
bar

CHRIS

You found him in a bar
Chris smiles Stevo frowns

STEVO
Frankie

FRANK
Don’t call me Frankie I hate that

-pauses-—
Or Francis

STEVO
Frank

CHRIS (IN GAELIC)
This guy is an idiot

FRANK (IN GAELIC)
It was short notice

Stevo rolls his eyes at the foreign language He tries to
talk to Justine

STEVO
I’m Stevo What’s your name

FRANK
Don’t talk to her

STEVO
Why not

FRANK
Do you know her

STEVO
No

FRANK

STEVO
Yeah

Justine makes a face ‘thats a suprise’

FRANK
Where is the van from

STEVO
I bought it like you said Bernie

FRANK
Good You did exactly what I said

Stevo is embarrassed by the questioning in front of Justine

STEVO
Come on Frank I’m not totally
stupid

CHRIS

That’s up for debate

FRANK
You got any foundation with you

Justine love
JUSTINE
Sure
Justine pulls out a compact Stevo works out what’s about to
be asked
STEVO
Oh Frank fuckkk
Frank hands it over

FRANK
You put it on boy

STEVO
Jesus Frank

FRANK
Put it on or Ill give you one on
the other side to match

Stevo sadly applies the powder to his eye It helps a bit
Frank looks at him He softens
FRANK (CONTD)
Come here

He grabs the powder and applies the makeup

FRANK (CONTD)
I don’t know what she sees in you

CHRIS
I bet he is dynamite in the sack

Justine looks round She looks at Chris and shakes her head
‘no’
STEVO
You can tell by looking
JUSTINE
It’s my super power

Chris watches Frank apply the make up to Stevo he shakes his
head Stevo notices and pouts

FRANK
Keep your fucking head still

Justine looks up and sees something

JUSTINE
Here he comes

We see a guy shambling out of the shadows He moves towards
the car Good looking longish hair as is the fashion Suede
jacket Blue jeans His name is Ord

Frank slaps Stevo’s cheeks

FRANK
There you go You look great

The man approaches he smiles broadly when he sees Justine He
stops by the Plymouth

ORD
Hey Justine

JUSTINE
Hey Ord

ORD
These your boyfriends

JUSTINE
Yeah

ORD
Hey fellas

Frank is tight lipped We see Ord as Frank sees him Clear
eyed (this is a tell for Frank of exercise and general
dangerousness) He looks military

FRANK
Afternoon You’re late

ORD
I’m sorry Traffic

Frank looks Ord in the eye for a moment

ORD (CONT’D)
I love your accent

FRANK
Do you

ORD
Kerry

FRANK

Holywood

ORD
Hollywood

He smiles Frank gets this reaction a lot Holywood is
between Belfast and Bangor in Ireland Hollywood is in
California

FRANK
The real fucking Holywood

Ords’ smile remains as he looks to the backseat

ORD
And these guys

FRANK
You don’t need to know their names

ORD
I do Frank It’s polite

There’s a moment Ords’ smile never leaves his lips Chris
looks over for the first time He takes his sun glasses off
He reveals cold eyes

CHRIS
Chris

Ord turns to Stevo He looks at the make up covered eye He
registers something is a bit weird here

STEVO
Stevo - and that’s Bernie

Bernie waves from the van

ORD
Okay My names James Ordan You can
call me Ord Okay

FRANK
Please to meet you ‘Ord’ Can we
get on with this please

ORD
Sure Just a few guide-lines for
you all This is obviously a tense
situation I am armed

Ord opens his jacket with a flourish to reveal a holster and
pistol He gestures to it dramatically

ORD (CONT’D)
I am sure that you are too

Frank doesnt give anything away Stevo grins embarrassed at
having his mind read Maybe he is made of glass

ORD (CONTD)
I want to get home tonight Ive
got shit to do I appreciate you
are very serious heavy freedom
fighting mother fuckers Fuck the
Brits Free Ireland I get that
That’s cool This is home of ‘Fuck
the Brits’

Ord looks at Frank and Chris’s faces They look on
impassively at his attempts at levity

Lets just take this calm

Did you all jack off before coming
here

The moment hangs there for a split second

FRANK
What was that

ORD
Did you jack off In the hotel

Ord makes the international gesture for masturbation

FRANK
What the fuck does it have to

ORD
I’m not working with any one who
brought a loaded weapon

There is a moment of silence Frank and Chris smirk

STEVO
I did

Justine smiles

FRANK
Christ Steven

There is a pause Ord has doing his job well The tension is
defused a little

They get out of the car Bernie joins them from the van

They follow Ord towards the warehouse Justine looks around
The buildings are abandoned and nailed shut If you wanted to
run there would be no where to go

Chris is carrying a brief case

Ord looks at Stevo

ORD
Why are you wearing makeup
Before Stevo can say ‘I walked into a door’ Frank interrupts

FRANK
He has a birth mark

Ord doesnt buy this for a second

ORD
O-kay

Chris glances around

CHRIS
Who owns this place

ORD
A friend of a friend There’s a
security guy but he’s not here
today Taking a ‘religious’
holiday

This last bit is an obvious lie Ord smirks at the idea of a
religious holiday

FRANK
What did they used to do here

ORD
Make stuff

Not any more though
Titles roll over the walk
Music Boston plays ‘More than a feeling’
Title Free Fire
In yellow futura extra bold font

Title Adapted from the novel ‘IRON SIGHT’ by Jerome Karim

INT WAREHOUSE CORRIDOR

The group walk inside along dark concrete corridors Frank
looks a little tense He scans around expecting trouble

Ord is not bothered He knows the situation

The rest of the titles play out here Stars Producers
Financiers Writer

INT WAREHOUSE FACTORY

We see the group move through a broken down factory Pigeons
flap about disturbed

Title Directed by Ben Wheatley

A big wide as the group move through a large empty space

INT WAREHOUSE CORRIDOR

They walk through a corridor The door closes behind them and
clicks shut

Ord looks back at it for a split second

INT WAREHOUSE CORRIDOR

They walk along another corridor and then enter out into
another large space

INT WAREHOUSE
The warehouse has hefty concrete pillars dotted around it

The ground is littered with broken bottles Refuse sacks
piles of rubbish bits of abandoned cars broken foundations
of offices and smashed machine tool plinths The foundations
are stubby walls marking out where the offices would have
been in the factory At their highest around two feet
Sometimes lower than a foot

Frank looks around scanning the space

We see far back from the group A POV of another person
behind a pillar watching them

The group move towards the middle of the warehouse There is
a small fold out table

FRANK
Where are we going

Ord turns gesturing to the table

ORD
We are here

Frank looks out to the shadows Chris turns around and looks
about There is a staircase leading off to offices Justine
looks up There are skylights She looks out to the far
pillar She looks nervous

FRANK
Where are your friends

ORD
They can see you

FRANK
If there’s a problem I guarantee
you will be the first to go

ORD
I told you Frank I’ve got things
to do tonight

Chris scans the area It’s quiet Justine looks to Ord

JUSTINE
Okay let’s wrap this up Ord

Ord whistles A metal shutter rolls up at the far end of the
warehouse Two figures enter Martin Kargo and Vernon
Jeffries Martin is thin and wiry Vernon is thick set with a
heavy moustache Vernon is carrying a rifle bag Their
footsteps echo around the space They approach

VERNON
Justine

JUSTINE
Vernon

Vernon unzips the bag and pulls out an AR18 automatic rifle
He puts it on the table Frank watches him carefully The
AR18 looks like a standard machine gun Same characteristics
as an M16 Black and dangerous looking

VERNON
AR18 Factory fresh

Vernon takes out the magazine and puts it on the table He
then pulls back the rack three times and presents it to Frank
so he can see that there are no rounds in the weapon All
this time he has been pointing the weapon at the ground
Vernon lays the now definitely empty weapon on the table

Frank picks it up and weighs it in his hands He passes it to
Chris Chris puts down his briefcase Martin watches this
Frank notices Martin

STEVO
A widow-maker

FRANK
Shut up

STEVO

That’s what

FRANK
Shut up

MARTIN
Hey good to see you My Mothers
people are from Sligo

CHRIS
That’s nice

FRANK
You doing us a Sligo reduction
then

MARTIN
We’re doing our bit I don’t need
to be here at all

Frank sucks his teeth He knows what doing your bit entails
And it’s cost him a lot more than Martin would ever be
prepared to give up

Chris smells the gun He looks down the barrel

CHRIS
You got some rounds

VERNON
Sure

Vernon rolls the bullets along the table top Chris takes the
rounds and pops them in the magazine

ORD
I’m going to slowly take out my
handgun Is that okay Frank
Frank looks at Chris Chris nods Its okay

FRANK
Sure Okay

Ord takes out his pistol and aims it at the ground
MARTIN

This is just a precaution While
the rifle is live

CHRIS
You worked with these guys before
Ord

ORD
Sure

FRANK

It’s okay to fire

VERNON
Fire away No one can hear us

CHRIS
Hey Ord You ever used your
military background to chat up
women

MARTIN
Try not to hit any metalwork I
don’t want to get tagged by a
ricochet

Chris gives him a slow sad look He shoulders the rifle and
takes aim

ORD
Military background

Chris looks over at Justine
CHRIS
Your memories of war the band of
brothers Blah blah
ORD
No Who would want to hear that
shit

The others step away and put their fingers in their ears

CHRIS
You more the silent type Ord

Chris squeezes off a round as Ord is about to answer

CHRIS (CONTD)
Sorry what

Ord goes to talk again

BOOM ORD
I hear its all about eye
contact

CHRIS (CONTD)
I’m sorry - what

ORD
It’s about eye contact And caring
words

Chris looks at Justine who is giggling slightly Chris makes
a ‘maybe he has a point’ face Then pulls the trigger

It makes a huge noise in the space In the distance there is
a thwack as the bullet hits home The ejected cartridge hits
the floor and rolls about

Chris looks back at the others Then to Frank

CHRIS
Good

FRANK
Okay

Chris squeezes of a few more shots Refuse bags pop A locker
falls over There’s a clanging echo in the Warehouse The
echo of the shots dims

Chris then adjusts the Rifle to full auto He lets off a
burst

He then puts on the safety Takes out the magazine and pulls
the rack ejecting a live round He does this twice more and
presents it to Vernon

Vernon nods when he sees it’s safe

Chris puts the rifle back on the table Ord holsters his
pistol Chris takes out a pen and uses it to pick up the
brass He puts them on the table He looks up at the pillar
near the table He walks over to it Ord watches him

FRANK (CONTD)
I thought we had talked about
M16s

MARTIN
We did

FRANK
The Brits wont even use these
things They fail in the mud
Chris runs his hands over the pillar There are pock marks in
it He looks at Ord (What Chris is looking at are fresh
bullet scars This place has recently been used as a firing
range)
VERNON
Well don’t roll about in the mud
INT WAREHOUSE BY THE PILLAR
Ord watches Chris looking at Pillar

ORD
What is the matter

CHRIS
What does that look like to you
INT WAREHOUSE

Frank frowns and starts negotiating Justine watches Chris

FRANK
I’ve got money for M16s

VERNON
Well I’ve got AR-18’s - that’s it

Ord looks at the marks

ORD
Bullet hits

He shrugs Not understanding why it might be relevant

Chris looks out to the edges of the warehouse They would
have come from a ways off Chris looks to Ord then gives up
on his investigation He turns to Vernon

CHRIS
How many
VERNON

CHRIS
They all folding stock
VERNON
Sure
FRANK

Well where are they

MARTIN
Lets see the money chief

Chris pops the case on the table He opens it up Martin goes
into his bag and pulls out a money counter Inside we see a
20 round mag for the AR18 He feeds the money into the
counter Justine looks at the money for a moment

They all stand around and stare as he does it

VERNON
It’s not that we don’t trust you
it’s just easier this way

FRANK
Sure

The money flips through the counter It comes to an end
Martin looks up

MARTIN
40000

CHRIS
What would you do if you won the
lottery

JUSTINE

Id buy a cabin back home

VERNON
What’s the matter with here

JUSTINE
I like it here but it’s just
moving through y’know

VERNON
Not really

FRANK
So you going to do us a reduction
on these non M16’s

VERNON
Ill do them at 10 off

FRANK

VERNON

Chris nods
FRANK
Okay So I take 1200 back
VERNON
Sure I can do you that in ammo if
you want
FRANK

You were going to charge extra on
the ammo

VERNON
It’s specialist You got a press
you can do it in your garage or
what not

Frank shrugs defeated

INT VAN

Inside the van sits Gordon 32 Shoulder length hair Leather
jacket Harry 27 Baby faced Bomber jacket Harry is
picking his knuckles They are grazed from fighting Gordon
watches out of the corner of his eye
HARRY
You got the walky turned on

GORDON
Yeah thanks

HARRY
Weve been here ages Maybe
something has gone wrong

GORDON
Sure They would have squawked The
signal

HARRY
How long have you worked for
Vernon

GORDON

Long enough Your energy is very
jumpy Can you ratchet it down a
couple of notches

HARRY
Sure I’m just ready I guess

GORDON
To load some boxes

HARRY
No just peeeewwwwww ready

Gordon rolls his eyes
GORDON
You need to wash those knuckles or

you will get an infection

HARRY
I was in a fight

The walky squawks

GORDON
That’s the sign

Gordan starts up the van John Denver starts up on the
track

GORDON (CONTD)
You like John Denver

HARRY
Sure

INT WAREHOUSE

In the distance there is the noise of a van starting up The
men stand patiently as it approaches Frank is tense He
looks over to Chris Chris is not scared but looks on
intensely He strokes his jacket where his gun is Frank
looks to Martin The van enters the warehouse

MARTIN
Look if we wanted to rip you off
it would have happened already

Frank looks them up and down for a second He’s like a cat
with a mouse

FRANK
How do you all know each other

MARTIN
Will it make the guns fire any
straighter if you knew

Vernon points at Justine

VERNON
She vouches for us That’s how it
works

Justine smiles Thats right

VERNON (CONTD)
I don’t want to know you Frank
I’ve got enough friends already
You Don’t want to know me She
brings us all together Its safer
that way

Franks face is set He’s smiling but he’s not happy Justine
detects this Martins is resolute in not talking

JUSTINE
My father had a gun shop in Sweden
I’ve known the Corsican since I was
kid They know the Corsican so we
are all friends

FRANK
That’s cozy You always been into
guns Justine

JUSTINE
I grew up with them How about you

FRANK
My Father took me shooting when I
was a boy

(MORE )

FRANK (CONTD)
I’ve always been around them He
was a good shot Later he was in
the Easter uprising It was a good
skill to have

ORD
Story time over

FRANK
What war were you in Ord

ORD
Whatever it was the great Irish
army wasn’t involved

INT WAREHOUSE
The van rolls in It comes to a stop The two men get out

They walk around the back of the truck and start unloading
One of the men looks at Stevo He walks around the van

Martin opens the back door with a key on his key chain The

two men (Gordon and Harry) Start lugging out the boxes They
are about 05 ft by 3ft wooden containers with rope handles
Martin takes the van keys from Harry and pockets them

Soon there is a pile of boxes Gordon and Harry are sweating
slightly Harry is eyeing Stevo

FRANK
Lets have a look then

Vernon takes a crowbar and opens one of the boxes Inside are
three AR18’s in wood chippings Frank smiles He points to a
random box

CHRIS

What’s your daughter called
JUSTINE

Agneth
FRANK

How about that one
Vernon shrugs and opens it Same deal

CHRIS
Just open em all

The boxes are opened up Inside sit the AR18’s Frank purses
his lips Chris leans into Justine Martin watches neutrally

CHRIS (CONTD)
I can’t believe you wont see me
tomorrow

JUSTINE
Do you think I’m stupid
CHRIS
What
JUSTINE
Stop pretending to be interested in
my kid
CHRIS

Just making conversation
Chris looks at the guns Vernon looks over his shoulder

VERNON
They like to run wet Keep it lubed
even when its dirty

He pulls out a can of lube

VERNON (CONTD)
On the house

Chris plays with the folding stock

CHRIS
You got the ammo

VERNON
Sure In the back But not yet

Chris smiles Everyone is cautious

Harry takes another look at Stevo as he passes with a box
Stevo looks at him with vague recognition This look turns to
cold dread over the next few moments Gordon and Harry bring
the last box out and put it down

Round the other side of the van Stevo motions to Bernie

STEVO
Look who it is

Bernie looks back over his shoulder and spots Harry

BERNIE
Oh fuck no Has he made you

STEVO
How could he not

Frank makes an inventory of the contents of the boxes He
counts the contents and Chris has a look at a random sample
They are all the same - this is the real deal All new Harry
is sneaking peaks at Stevo here and there As each box is
signed off it’s resealed and stacked

A two foot high wooden wall is being built out of packing
cases Gordon looks and sees Harry looking agitated
Round the back of the van he talks to Harry

GORDON
What’s the matter with you

HARRY
I don’t know I think I know those
guys

GORDON
Cops

HARRY

No From last night

GORDON
You better get your shit together
because we are in a serious
situation here Just chill out

Around the front of the van the deal is coming to a close

MARTIN
Okay That’s our business almost
done here

CHRIS
You tell the Corsican thanks

MARTIN
Perfecto We will leave and then
you load out Give us 5 minutes
You can drive your vehicle round on
Lassiter

STEVO
Okay Got it

Harry is staring now Staring at Stevo Gordon looks from
Harry to Vernon

GORDON
Harry

HARRY
I know you

STEVO
Me

GORDON

Shut up Harry

VERNON
What’s the problem Gordon

Martin looks at his watch and glances to Justine She takes a
small step back His watch is ticking towards 12

HARRY
Yeah

STEVO
No you don’t

HARRY
Yeah I do

Martin takes a small look to the far pillars

MARTIN
What’s this about Harry

HARRY
This is the guy that hit us last
night at Harlequins Him and his
buddy there

Bernie shifts uncomfortably

There is a pause Frank looks up Chris looks carefully at
Harry

VERNON
Is this true
STEVO
I don’t know what you are talking

about
A moment passes Vernon stares at Stevo

VERNON
You are a terrible liar son

FRANK
Come on now Don’t be calling my
brother in-law a liar

Stevo is starting to sweat He looks to Frank Bernie looks
into the middle distance trying to disappear

FRANK (CONTD)
Tell them Steven

STEVO
I don’t know what he’s talking
about

Harry’s face is red with anger As he says the next few lines
it’s as if he is stepping on an emotional gas peddle He goes
from straight to ENRAGED in eight words

HARRY
Last night there was a fight in
Harlequins Started by this guy and
his friends My cousin Sally
Perigan She was bottled She’s
still in the hospital

Frank grimaces Justine looks to Stevo She’s not happy about
what she is hearing Bernie looks blank Chris looks at Ord
Looks at Ord’s hands Frank talks very slowly and
deliberately

FRANK
We are here for work Not to talk
about the rights or wrongs of
particular bar fights

VERNON
I agree

Harry twitches He is on the rack here He knows this is the
wrong place But his sense of righteousness is eating him
alive

HARRY
Her face is fucked up

Vernon smiles in a fatherly way
VERNON

Well that’s something you will
have to take care of another day

ORD
We can sort this thing out later
Harry
HARRY
He ground the glass into her face
STEVO
I wasn’t there This is bullshit
HARRY
Was he all banged up after last
night
STEVO

I walked into a door I’ve never
been to that bar

Stevo is stepping forward towards Harry Bernie is naturally
moving in Harry is moving forward with Gordon as his wing
man It’s coming together It’s like it wants to happen

STEVO (CONTD)
I didn’t start it You
motherfucker

CHRIS
You need to stop talking now

Stevo punches Harry Harry falls back He scrambles to his
feet and grabs at Stevo The two men fall to floor in a flail
of punches and short screams of exertion

Ord looks over to Chris and shrugs

CHRIS (CONTD)
Christ

Ord and Frank move in and pull the two men apart They grab
them and pries them open

Chris is putting a little distance between himself and the
others Ord and Frank have hold of the flailing men

HARRY
YOU FUCKING SHIT I’LL KILL
YOUFUCKERS LET ME GO LET

ME GO

ORD
I will Harry but you have to
relax

Ord looks to Chris He can see Harry is about to go There is
a moment when the fire could catch again just on the vapors

Harry wipes his face he is so conflicted He’s never backed

down in a fight before

Stevo is released by Frank and is wiping blood from his nose
and gasping for air

Harry looks around at the other men Chris puts out his hand
flat and bends down a bit It’s placatory body language He
is talking slowly The sound has shifted now It feels
muffled Variously the characters are entering into an
endorphin state as their bodies flood with adrenalin

CHRIS
I’m sorry to hear about your
cousin But we are taking these
guns now and leaving

Ord lets go of Harrys’ arm Chris backs away to give himself
a bit of distance He instinctively knows what’s about to go
down

MARTIN
Let’s go Harry

HARRY
Okay that’s okay

Harry goes to walk away He talks quietly Defeated

HARRY (CONT’D)
She was only 17
Stevo watches Harry walk away
STEVO
Then she shouln’t have been out

should she

Chris is watching Harry’s hands He looks over to Martin
Chris’s hand twitches He looks back

Harry twists in Martins’ arms pulling a snub-nosed 38 Ord
sees and pushes forward to get to Harry

ORD
NO

Harry fires at Stevo Time slows

Flare flashes from the muzzle of the snub-nose

Stevo is hit in the shoulder It opens up in an explosion of
material and blood

In one action his hand pulls out his M1911 hand-gun from his
jacket Stevo falls

Frank looks on in low resignation This is his fault for
bringing the idiot along

Justine looks at Ord Can he help stop this
Ord catches Justine’s look It’s out of his hands now

Martin grabs at Harry trying to stop him The men all stare
at each other for a moment

Frank steps backward and gets ready to pull

Chris scans back and forth to see which way this is going to
go

There is a split second where this fight might not escalate
But Chris knows as soon as the first shot is fired the guns
will come out and there’s no other place to go

Bernie looks on frozen to the spot

Gordon takes a step back He looks on blankly

Martin takes a step back He is staring at Stevo falling

Martin bumps into the table The AR18 and a detached magazine
falls off it

Vernon looks at Chris and sees the look He doesnt even
think and goes for his pistol

Ord staggers back looking for cover He shifts his body
weight out of the line of fire of Stevo

Vernon pulls his pistol A Colt Cobra A snub-nosed 38

Chris quick draws his pistol a police 38 He tucks his arm
in so that his hand is in close to his hip (A classic close
combat stance)

Frank pulls his pistol A Browning 9mm automatic

Martin pulls his A 44 Python He cocks it He looks around
for a target

Ord moves backwards towards the AR18 cases
Vernon fumbles with the safety catch on his pistol

Chris has hunckered down to make as small a target as
possible and is trying to get to cover He sees the pillar
out of his periphery vision Tactically he figures there are
too many people to engage He needs to move and shoot to get
to a safe position

Justine pulls her pistol - a 38 police special She nervously
looks around

Bernie is frozen His hands come up slowly He wants no part
in this

Harry fires again The hammer smashing down on a bullets’
percussion cap It fires igniting the gunpowder The pistol
kicks as the bullet exits The cylinder turns and engages
another cartridge

The bullet whistles past Stevo’s head as he falls backwards

Ord pulls out his pistol from a kneeling position A Colt
M1991A1 Compact

Stevo fires his automatic The pistol spits fire The slide
jerks back and a shell casing ejects

The high calibre slug misses Harry and hits Gordon blowing
his ear off His long hair blows in the air at the impact

Gordon grabs the side of his face as blood arcs out of his
head He starts to scream but he is trapped in syrup like in
a dream

Vernon is nervously fiddling with his pistol trying to unlock
the safety while backing away

Bernie is watching events unfold around him He is still
frozen

Ord takes aim on Chris He tracks him in the iron sights of
his automatic It’s hard to hit him as Vernon moves across
his line of sight

Chris fires in twos Double taps TAP TAP He hits Martin at
close range A gob of gore sprouts from Martins’ head

Stevo hits the floor He is still firing A second bullet
chambers

BANG - a spent cartridge spins across space

He totally misses Harry The bullet screams off wide A light
in the ceiling explodes Sparks fly

Martin drops to his knees Blood spits from his head

Ord fires on Chris Misses the first shot and hits him with
the second Winging his arm Ord is concentrated on his iron
sight He tries to control the dump of adrenalin that’s in
his system He starts to experience tunnel vision

INT WAREHOUSE 200 METERS OUT EAST

Jimmy 40 Slim black jacket steps out of the shadows with
his Ml carbine He licks his fingers and wets the iron sight
at the end of his rifle He watches for a moment as shots are
fired in the distance Gunsmoke is gathering in the air He
looks nervous this wasn’t the plan He looks to the far side
of the warehouse and sees a second rifle man Howie

INTWAREHOUSE HOWIES PILLAR 200 METRES OUT WEST

Far away from the action we find Howie 53 Pot bellied

position Is this what they should be doing

We see down his iron sight In the distance we see the gun
battle

INT WAREHOUSE

Vernon fires his pistol at Stevo and the bullet nicks Stevo’s
thigh Blood squirts out He turns and fires behind him

Shell casings ping into the air

Chris fires his 38 hitting Vernon’s arm He staggers back
Half running It’s like he has been punched

Martin fires his pistol involuntarily It kicks back The
ripple going down his arm

The shot ricochets across the floor and whines towards Frank
Frank almost bunny hops to the side in shock
Chris fires his pistol at Harry and hits him in the side

Harrys’ jacket puffs up and explodes with blood The bullet
exits Harry spins Already off balance

Bernie starts to realize what’s happening around him and runs
towards a pillar

Frank fires his pistol at Vernon He fires wide and the round
hits the van It makes a low DUNK noise

Bang
Justine darts right to avoid the gun fire
BANG

Harry falls backwards and fires into the air Another
ricochet pangs off the light fixtures

BANG

Stevo fires his third shot It’s wide and inaccurate

BANG

Gordon drops his pistol and grabs his head Blood squirts out
through his fingers He falls to the side and slides down the

side of the van

Harry collapses into the dust

Gordon clambers too his feet and looks for an exit

INT WAREHOUSE
Vernon dives out of the way Harry tries to shield himself
from the incoming gunfire It’s chaos The initial pistol
shoot-out is superceded by the introduction of much greater
fire power
The Ml Carbine fire continues in bursts of three A shot goes
wide and hits Gordon in the leg He is spun around and
collapses to the ground again

makes eye contact with Ord

Ord looks at him from behind the AR18 boxes They are the

Chris gestures to Ord ‘What the fuck is this’

ORD
THEY ARE NOT WITH US

CHRIS
SOUNDS LIKE A FUCKING GARRAND

CHANK ting

Ord looks around in the boxes He finds Vernons’ bag

Frank fires again at Vernon who is trying to move out of the
way Vernon takes a round in the leg and as he falls he fires
again hitting nothing His jacket rips open and AR18 rounds
tinkle to the ground

Chris tries to take cover from the increasing rifle
crossfire Bullets zing through the air He grabs one of the

AR18 rounds from the floor and picks up the fallen rifle

Vernon grabs at him

VERNON

Chris grabs one of the loose rounds and stabs Vernon in the

Ord pulls out an AR18 from a packing case and slams the
magazine into it He racks it

He takes aim at Howie

in Jimmys’ direction

time to practise

her leg She flinches as it pours on She squirts some
perfume on the wound as well The alcohol works as an
antiseptic

Yeah You think they were with Ord
and Vern

got wind of the deal

Maybe You badly hurt

And wait for them to bring Rick O
Shea and his brothers down here

head Maybe

Let’s have a look at you

Ord looks at Vernon’s leg wound He tidies up the bandage
looks around finds some cardboard He starts to rip it up

likely to kill us than bullets
Pigeon shit Chemicals And you
are going to crawl around in it
with open wounds You need every
bit of help you can get

He ties the cardboard around his legs

he has He frowns He puts his hand in his pocket and finds a
couple of bullets He reloads his gun

aim He has even less chance of hitting him now

with a nervous look over to the South pillar he prepares to

You get away from that

Justine has her 38 in her fist Gordon gets to the pistol
before Justine He grabs at it Justine brings the 38 down
hard on Gordan’s fingers He screams and she hits him again
His fingers are broken His pistol skitters away even
further Justine looks over to it and then back to Gordon
Gordon realizes what she is thinking and jumps forward with
all his might He grabs at her and they grapple on the floor

Justine smacks her 38 into his wounded head His hands creep
over her face trying to smother her She bashes at his head
with the gun like it’s a hammer She reaches out for the
other pistol

Gordon uses his other arm to choke her Justine bites into
his broken fingers He screams Justine spits out a finger
She grabs the pistol and shoots Gordon in the face He falls
back looking shocked Blood runs down his face from a hole
below his eye He breathes heavily as he looks at her She
fires again and kills him

Gordon falls to the ground

rolls himself onto one side and uses the van as a backstop to
slide himself upright He looks around woozily He knows that
he is very vulnerable at this point He also knows he has no
choice This is going to happen He hesitantly reaches up
with his hand It touches the cool metal of the van He
reaches up further and his hand gently touches the door
handle

pocket

He grabs the briefcase with the money and throws it in the

smile He is very weak now

deck jumps into life

which you always used

Put no difference into your tone
Wear no forced air of solemnity or
sorrow

Laugh as we always laughed

Let it be spoken without effect
Without the trace of a shadow on
