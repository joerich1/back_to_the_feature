WE RACE

Across a dusty field of Midwestern grass A storm cloud
curtain overhead A BOY OF 14 RUNS Like his life
depends on it Barefoot Breathless Terrified KRAK

A BOLT OF LIGHTNING BISECTS THE SKY Carrying us to --
ANOTHER NIGHT YEARS LATER

BARRY (VO)
Discharge of 45000 amps travels
the upper atmosphere --

The lightning unfurls at 1400TH SPEED revealing the
subtle spiderweb intricacies of its form

BARRY (VO) (CONTD)
-- a distance of 76 miles in 32
seconds

Too quick to be appreciated by any human EXCEPT ONE
Seen in SILHOUETTE Watching

BARRY (VO) (CONTD)
I move faster Ahead of the
thunder

TIME RESUMES the stroke of the lightning EXPLODES out at
NORMAL SPEED -- KRAKOOM Illuminating the night

EXT CENTRAL SQUARE - NIGHT

The flashing-light heart of Central City A city
fighting for its soul Streets tagged pocked Packed
with PEOPLE A NOISY crush of cars and cabs A
JUMBOTRON short a few broken pixels

The packed bustling impersonality of a metropolis FROZEN
IN TIME Urban hum at a STANDSTILL Time creeps in
ketchup increments An impossibly intricate tableau

BARRY (VO)
Every one of them consumed by the
noise and bustle -- they don’t
know how beautiful the city is
when it stops

CRASH INTO REAL TIME city life entropy taking over as

A RUSH OF WIND blows down the street carrying litter
with it Something MOVING Faster than thought

( )

BARRY (VO) (CONTD)
60 by 40 blocks each 25ths a
mile At any given moment there’s
a thousand places I’m needed

WE SPIN UP -- twisting craning -- to a God’s eye view of
the city -- the gridded pattern of city blocks A BLUR
OF SPEED navigates the city in a spiral

BARRY (VO)

I start at the center and work
outward in concentric circles
Thorough Only way to be sure I
don’t miss anything

A building under construction A GIRDER hanging in mid-
air A dangerous object in freefall Remember it

BARRY
28th floor 300 feet Rate of
descent 32 feet per second
squared 582 seconds to impact
Time I’m needed elsewhere

The CITY CLOCK TOWER’S second hand agonizes forth l

A SERIES OF POPS -- TIME SHIFTING GEARS FAST TO FROZEN --

-- A GUY steps off a curb on his cell oblivious to THE
CAB racing at him A BLAST OF WIND sets him back onto
the curb in time -- cab ROCKETING past --

-- A WOMAN RUNS from an ASSAILANT he’s gaining on her
A BLUR a HINT of AN ARM in motion an unseen FORCE
BODY CHECKING the guy into a wall HARD

-- A DRUG DEALER takes cash from a BUYER opens a heavy
bag -- a FLASH -- rapid FOOTFALLS -- the bag’s now EMPTY

-- The CLOCK TOWER TICKS again 2 THE GIRDER FALLS
further and

BARRY (VO)
Making a failed city safe And no
one even knows I exist

-- A MAN hands a MUGGER his watch The Mugger PULLS che
TRIGGER on his gun anyway -- the HAMMER dropping
FINGER CLICKS it back TIME RAMPS BACK UP and the MUGGER
IS CUFFED gun in an EVIDENCE BAG just out of reach

-- A CIGARETTE ripped from a young KID’S lips --

( )

BARRY (VO)
Living between the ticks of
seconds

-- A CAR CHASE IN PROGRESS TWO GANGBANGERS in an
Escalade FIRE Tec-9’s at the COPS behind them Their

guns DISAPPEAR -- Escalade pulled over -- FLIPPED over --
the ‘bangers handcuffed -- cops wondering how --
BARRY (VO)
That’s me

BACK TO CENTRAL SQUARE FROZEN IN TIME The girder in

suspended animation freefall -- ABOUT TO HIT -- PEOPLE
staring scared -- SHIFT BACK TO REAL TIME as --
A CYCLONE coils beneath it -- countering gravity’s force --
catching it -- laying it to rest safely on the ground
BARRY (VO)
I’m an eyeblink A sunburst

LIGHTNING CRACKS ABOVE Slow Majestic

BARRY (VO)
A flash

Only now do we see THE MAN in the center of it all lit
by the LIGHTNING BARRY ALLEN 28 Eyes alive with an
earnestness and determination only grown in the American
Midwest The only one MOVING FREELY amid the FROZEN

No classic costume yet Street clothes Specialized
BOOTS treaded thick for traction and abuse

BARRY (VO)
Central City’s famous phase
lightning An anomaly that floors
the tourists Ignored by the
locals Except me

Then -- something catches Barry’s eye A BLUE GLOW
lights the city sky More trouble

BARRY (VO)
I see the explosion before I hear
it Blue fire Methane

BOOM The EXPLOSION Barry saw The SOUND finally
arriving But Barrys gone he’s

EXT BURNING BUILDING - 023 SECONDS LATER

Barry looks up firelight reflecting in his face A
derelict building burns Consumed floor by floor

BARRY (VO)
Condemned But in Central City
condemned doesn’t mean empty

Barry shoots inside INTO A MAZE OF FLAMES An
obstacle course of hellfire He dodges them all --
diving running scanning every hall and room --

A SCREAM Calls for help The fire rages the building
coming down with him in it But he follows the cries --
into an apartment bursts past a crumbling door to find --

A DIGITAL PLAYER SPEAKERS THE ROOM IS EMPTY A TRAP

BARRY (VO) (CONT’D)
Someone set this up Set me up

The thought shattered by A WAVE OF FIRE Through it A
glimmer A FACE Watching Waiting as --

THE FLOOR COLLAPSES UNDER BARRY -- feet lacking traction
he FALLS -- into the all-consuming flames and we --

SMASH TO BLACK
TWO WEEKS EARLIER

Barry runs Normal human speed Not yet the Flash
Not even close RAIN pelts him as he huffs for breath
winded A Redweld file for an umbrella He’s tired
Weight of the world on thin shoulders He reaches the
front step of --

EXT LOWER MIDDLE CLASS HOME - NIGHT

He shakes the rain off Clips a CSI BADGE to his off-the-
rack jacket An anxious attempt at looking presentable

BARRY
Norma Ayres

MRS AYRES 50s face aged by grief lasers in on Barry’s
badge She pales

BARRY
I’m sorry I didn’t call first --

MRS AYRES
-- Can I help you Detective

( )

BARRY
Actually I’m not a detective
Forensic scientist Y’know a
CSI Like the guys on TV

Barry offers up a smile he hopes is charming as we

INT MRS AYRES’ HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

MRS AYRES
If this is about Michael that
was seven years ago

Barry nods his understanding laying out the file’s
contents -- crime scene photos coroner’s report etc

BARRY

The police couldn’t identify the
bomber who killed your son because
they couldn’t reconstruct the
bomb

(enthusiasm showing)
See a bomb is like a fingerprint
In Michael’s case the only useful
evidence from the crime scene was
fragments of ceramic But there
are hundreds of thousands of kinds
in the US alone

MRS AYRES
Then I really don’t see what --

BARRY
I identified them They’re
industrial grade Manufactured by
a biotech company named Biolex
They use it in hip prosthetics

MRS AYRES
You found it out of thousands

BARRY

Just have to spend the time
(now the hard part)

Next step is to subpoena Biolex’s
sales records But to do that we
need to first exhume Michael’s
body and remove the ceramic
fragments I need the consent
of a family member

( )

MRS AYRES
Seven years of nothing and now you
come here and all you can tell me
is you-- you want to dig up my
boy Get out of my house

BARRY
I’ll leave the form with you In
case you change your mind
He offers his card She doesn’t take it Silence
SMASH TO
FOOMP The folder lands next to a dozen just like it
More of his theories He SLAMS the TRUNK shut on them

INT BARRY’S CAR - NIGHT

Barry gets in his shitty ‘98 Camry He checks the PHONE
he left in the car -- startled as it RINGS INSTANTLY

CHYRE (ON PHONE)
You think because you don’t answer
I don’t know what you’re doing

The voice belongs to FRED CHYRE Barry’s boss He’d be
a happier man if he retired

CHYRE (ON PHONE)
Ten-fifty-five at the River

Shit Barry starts his car It hums to life then
SPUTTERS OUT Barry tries again Nothing Shit

SMASH TO

BARRY RUNNING Rain-soaked and hauling ass as best he
can His shoes SLAM the pavement SMASHING us back to --

The YOUNG BOY Running in the field YOUNG BARRY Bare

feet kick up dirt Tears streak his face panic grips

his breath LIGHTNING FLASHES again and we are --

EXT TWIN CITIES RIVERBANKS - CRIME SCENE - NIGHT

A wide stretch on the bank of the river that cuts Central

City off from its sister city KEYSTONE Both skylines

dominated by a massive futuristic TOWER Barry runs up
CHYRE

Youre late Again

( )

BARRY
Sorry

CHYRE
We’re on a clock here One of
those freak storm’s is coming
Gonna wash out all the evidence

He looks skyward The City’s “phase lightning” setting
the sky on fire Chyre points ahead --

CHYRE
Jane Doe Slice-n-Dice figures
she’s been in the water three
weeks Washed up from Keystone
(off Barrys look)
The back of her shirt had a dry
cleaning tag Keystone Cleaners

Barry joins the coroner DAISUKE SATO (“Slice-n-Dice” to
his friends) there with DETECTIVE JARED MORILLO (African-
American planning to make Captain)

They examine a WOMAN’S CORPSE Bloated Her face is

DEFORMED

Strange even for a floating body

SATO
Tissue degradation of some kind
Never seen anything like it Even
rubbed out the prints No dental
work either

BARRY
I might be able to do a facial
approximation

MORILLO
If you switch precincts sure
Floater’s from Keystone remember

BARRY
In October the tide goes towards
Keystone She was killed there
no way she’d end up in Central
Not for two months minimum

Morillo turns to Chyre Is he kidding

CHYRE
You just memorized tide tables
(off Barry’s look)
Youre exhausting you know that

INT CENTRAL CITIZEN - BULLPEN - NIGHT

Bullpen of the Twin Cities’ venerable newspaper IRIS
WEST answers her cell If you just fell in love with her
at first sight you’re not the only one INTERCUT

IRIS
Not the best time Barry

BARRY
You need something to get people
to read an actual paper these
days I can give you an hour’s
jump on the local affiliates

IRIS
Yeah that’s not really a concern --

WIDEN TO REVEAL the bullpen is nearly EMPTY The few
people that are there are PACKING UP THEIR DESKS

INT INFANTINO’S DINER - NIGHT

Basic late night crowd Iris is on her second coffee
The whirlwind inverse of considered laconic Barry

IRIS
A newspaper going under In this
golden age of print journalism I
tried to warn them Polite

emails “Maybe we should work on
the online content polish up the
site” “No the Citizen is a

newspaper this is how we’ve been
doing things for 80 years” What
was I thinking Trying to be a
reporter today it’s like saying
you want to be a milkman or fix
record players --

BARRY
Iris slow down --

Not likely Her CELL CHIRPS A TEXT

IRIS
Sports section’s holding a wake at
Broome’s they’re buying shots --
(texts back)
No thank you
(to Barry resuming
the dropped thought)

-- And I was starting to get
assignment work crime reporting
(MORE)

( )

IRIS (CONTD)
The good stuff Remember helping
me pad my résumé We sat right
over there that booth

BARRY IRIS
Do you know what you-- -- The news is like 30
minutes old so no I don’t
know what I’m going to do --

IRIS (CONTD)

And don’t say “It’s just a job
you can find another” There
arent any jobs Half the stories
we ran were about how there aren’t
any jobs

(a beat smiles)
Thanks for coming out Talking me
off the ledge

He smiles he barely said a word

EXT INFANTINO’S DINER - LATER
Iris buttons up At least the rain’s died down

IRIS

Maybe I shouldn’t think of it as
unemployed Maybe it’s more like
a chance to go to the gym I have
to wear a dress for my party I
could have those skinny bitch
clavicles --

(it hits her)
Ugh My party I have to be
unemployed in front of all those
people

(off his look)
My party This Saturday

BARRY
I remember I wouldn’t miss it
I don’t get invited to a lot of
parties
(then)
You’re gonna be all right Iris
You always are

IRIS
Somehow when you say it makes it
feel true

Deep layers of history here And feelings

( )

IRIS
Screw it I’m going to Broome’s
Come with me

BARRY
Gotta get back to the lab

IRIS
And you wonder why you don’t get
invited to parties

And she turns off down the damp street Barry watches
Loses her in the crowd Story of his life

EXT CENTRAL CITY POLICE PRECINCT - NIGHT

NORA ALLEN 40 Warm BARRY 10 ON HIS BED absorbed
in his MATH TEXTBOOK Deep in thought throwing a tennis
ball against the wall Old habit

NORA

wall one day

YOUNG BARRY
Not enough mass Id need to
throw it 500 miles an hour
(off her look)
Sorry Im stuck on a problem

Nora smiles at her son Places a COMIC over his book

NORA
Most kids like comic books more
than textbooks

BARRY
(handing it back)
Read it twice Jay Garrick beats
the Changeling a guy who can turn
into different animals

NORA
Then how about ice cream Lets
take a break

BARRY
After I figure this out

NORA

from a problem to see it more
clearly Lets go

INT CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT (PRESENT)

Barry pulls a carton of ICE CREAM from a freezer

EXT CENTRAL CITY STREET - NIGHT

decades ahead of its time The Tower we glimpsed
earlier THE STAR LABS ACCELERATOR

( )

NORA (PRELAP)
Dr Thawnes towers coming along

INT CAR - AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)

Parked on THAT SAME STREET Back when Central City was
smaller more personal Nora and Young Barry eat ice
cream cones problems forgotten

Out the window is a clear view of the ACCELERATOR TOWER
then just a FRAME in the early stages of construction

YOUNG BARRY
Its not a tower its a particle
accelerator Its going to shoot
a proton faster than light

NORA
Never know what Dr Thawne will
dream up next

YOUNG BARRY
Hes never even been interviewed
They say its because he works
like Edison never even sleeping --

NORA
You could miss a whole life like
that never having friends
never talking to anyone never
asking someone like Iris to the
fall dance

YOUNG BARRY
-- Mom

NORA
Im just saying Everybody needs
time out of the tower Even smart
people Especially smart people
(looks in his eyes)
Dont just think Barry Do
Feel Thats life lived

She rubs his head Barry takes that in Sees the time

EXT BALCONY - BARRY’S APARTMENT - LATER

Barrys halfway through his ice cream summarizing his
analysis into the recorder Exhausted frustrated

BARRY
--Cause of death appears to be
no cause of death Someone should
let her know she’s alive

His eyes get heavy As he drifts to sleep somewhere a
POLICE SIREN SCREAMS AND SUDDENLY IT’S --

Dawn The city is up Barry JOLTS awake the remainder
of his ice cream MELTED on his shirt Shit Barry wipes
the puddle off Then -- stops An epiphany

CLOSE ON THE “MURDER BOARD”

Closed cases in black open in red More red than black
Barry writes a new name under the suspect column “COLD”

BARRY
She was frozen at extreme low
temperatures and when she
melted her cell walls
collapsed Like blueberries
defrosting leaking all over

WIDEN to REVEAL we’re --

INT CSI BULLPEN - DAY
Barry turns to see Chyre walking off Disinterested
BARRY

Last night’s Jane Doe The cause
of death Extreme hypothermia

CHYRE
The river’s freezing this time of
year Did you even sleep

BARRY
Not this cold There’s more -- I
went back through the unsolveds --
there’s an open case where the
victim showed signs of extreme
hypothermia Two murders same
MO that’s the definition of --

Chyre pulls Barry aside Hushed

CHYRE
You do not say the words “serial
murder” Unless you want to make

an already scared city terrified

BARRY
Get me two hours with a mass
spectrometer If I knew the
temperature she was frozen at Id
be able to regenerate her image
which’d give us an ID --

CHYRE
The only thing I understood there
is “mass spectrometer” which we
don’t have --

BARRY CHYRE
-- let me requisition it -- I am not letting you
A serial murder would -- share this crazy theory

with anyone other than me

CHYRE
Your rep’s bad enough as it is --
all your crusades -- Like Michael

Ayres Yeah you think his mother
didn’t call to complain about you

BARRY
I’m just trying to close his case--

( )

CHYRE
You can close a million cases and
shell still be dead

Barry looks down at his files Just can’t give it up

CHYRE
You need to get some sleep and
you need to get laid Do those
two things I’ll buy you a mass
spectrometer myself Go home

Barry relents appreciating that in his own way this is
Chyre still giving a shit

INT BARRY’S APARTMENT - DAY

Barry walks in Chucks his keys Out of gas from an
already shitty day He looks at the unmade bed calling
to him to pass out Instead --

TIME CUT A light SNAPS ON in Barry’s walk-in closet
He grabs an OLD BINDER from a tower of DOZENS of them

BARRY (VO)
Old police trick Hit a roadblock
on your active case go back to
your bottom drawer one

TIME CUT A TV on and ignored in the background Barry
at his desk going through the binders A THOUSAND PAGES
thick The “Allen H” file open next to him Yellowed
newspaper clippings “LOCAL HOMICIDE HUSBAND CHARGED”

BARRYS MOTHER DEAD

Now we see what the binders are for Each labeled
“TCFIS” Twin Cities Fingerprint Index System

BARRY (VO)
Computers couldn’t make a match

He pages through the binders Comparing the prints there
with an official fingerprint record “ten-card”

( )

BARRY (VO)
So they need to be eyeballed

Nope Next Another 10 card No match Next Next

BARRY (VO)
Over 20000 fingerprints on record
per county 3141 counties in the
US 45 seconds to scan each
one equals 896 years Grain
of sand on a beach

(beat)

But I made a promise to someone

He turns a page focused the TV playing behind him

BARRY (VO)
So I clear my head And try to
focus on

Something catches Barry’s attention ON THE TV A NEWS
DEBATE CHYRON “STAR Accelerator Boon or Boondoggle”

TALKING HEAD (ON TV)
--why should the Accelerator pose
any greater danger than the tens
of billions of dollars worth of
equipment they operate without
incident every day

BARRY (VO)
(a grin)
What’s right in front of me

EXT STAR LABS - DAY

Barry turns towards the turret-shaped reception desk

RECEPTIONIST (CONT’D)
I’m sorry but Dr Perez says it’s

Barry steps away then sees THE TOUR GROUP An idea

INT STAR LABS - HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

Barry 3D glasses on walks with the tour The wholesome
TOUR GUIDE walks them past a series of HOLOGRAMS --

TOUR GUIDE
If you’ve ever used the internet
youve used the web-mesh
telegraphy Dr Thawne invented

One of the holograms A kindly MAN IN A WHEELCHAIR
Warm eyes brimming with intelligence EOBARD THAWNE
Then a hologram of the ACCELERATOR

TOUR GUIDE
Albert Einstein said no object can
move faster than light But Dr
Thawne is a smart man too And
his hope is to prove Dr Einstein
was wrong That’s why he built
the STAR Labs Accelerator to
send a particle faster than the
speed of light After 15 years
it’s only weeks from being ready
to experiment

A GRAPHIC shows a PROTON spinning around and around the
Accelerator until it disappears into LIGHT

CHUNKY KID
Will we get to see the mass
spectrometer

( )

TOUR GUIDE
I’m sorry no We won’t be
visiting the third floor

Barry smiles Slips Chunky a twenty as he backs away

INT STAR LABS - SOUTH WING 3RD FLOOR - MOMENTS LATER

Barry at the locked door to the MASS SPECTROMETER LAB
Talking on a SECURITY PHONE --

BARRY
Dr Perez was supposed to get me

Dr Thawne wants to see the
results immediately so --

Barry turns to see an ATTRACTIVE FEMALE EMPLOYEE enter

BARRY VALERIE
Dr Perez Detective

VALERIE
STAR Labs does not participate in
police investigations We
certainly don’t let police break
into our lab to use the equipment

BARRY
I’m a CSI We found a body with a
level of deformity that could only
come from exposure to extreme
cold I need to know exactly how
cold to reconstruct the victim --

VALERIE BARRY
It costs 25000 just to
turn this machine on I’m almost done --

( )

VALERIE (CONTD)
Not “almost” Now get out before
I call your police friends
He shoots her a look Part disappointment part apology
BARRY
This city has the highest unsolved
homicide rate in the country but
why should you care about that
Why should anybody

He leaves She watches him go Can’t help but feel bad

INT BARRY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

KID’S VOICE (0S)
It’s not cool to stare

Barry looks down at a 10-YEAR-OLD BOY forced to dress up

10-YEAR-OLD BOY
She’s getting married You don’t
drool on other guys’ girls

Barry is joinedrescued by MARY the boy’s mom and Iris’
caring maternal OLDER SISTER

MARY

Iris’ party if you behaved

10-YEAR-OLD BOY
I’m behaving --

MARY

BARRY
No

The kid storms off hating Barry Mary chastises --

MARY
Wally West No running --

They look across to Iris With Nathan

MARY
Funny how it all works out We
always thought it’d be you up
there with my sister

BARRY
Ring would be a lot smaller
Police Department doesn’t pay as
much as Newbury Financial

MARY
All those years you lived with my
family after You and Iris were

inseparable She waited for you
that whole time She waited while
you were at school the Academy
then always in your lab You
never stepped up and finally she
moved on

(she faces him)
She waited for you And if you
don’t know it it’s your own
fault

( )

CLINKCLINK A GLASS IS TAPPED All eyes turn to --
NATHAN He speaks with a clipped cadence commensurate
with Iris Someone who can keep up with her His toast

NATHAN
I just wanted to take this moment
to say how lucky I am Lucky
that this gorgeous girl happens to
go to the Twin Cities Museum the
one day a year Newbury Financial
holds its fundraiser Lucky
she’s staring at Degas’ Little
Dancer as I walk by the one
sculpture I can remember a damn
thing about from college

BARRY
Didn’t want to interrupt your
night You look great

IRIS
Thanks for coming It means a
lot None of this would count if
you weren’t here

She kisses him on the cheek Appreciative But it just
plain kills Barry It’s easier to get no kiss at all

BARRY

something else Then she finds a smile Off Barry

INT ALLEN HOME - BARRYS ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Young Barry does his homework Trying to tune out the
din His parents FIGHTING again His father SHOUTING
The fight grows louder joined by A RATTLING

Barry looks over His bedroom window is open banging in
the WIND (just like in his lab) Lightning FLASHES He
moves to the window Outside A LIGHTNING STORM

KRAKKK Barry recoils -- willing a hand forward -- to
shut the window when BARRY IS PULLED FORWARD --
THROUGH THE WINDOW --

Suddenly everything is a BLUR -- a gale wind -- sweeping
Barry up -- ROARING in his ears -- ALMOST SOUNDING LIKE
A VOICE

Young Barrys eyes widen -- did he hear that Confused

he looks around realizing hes suddenly
IN A FIELD

Yes that field The one from our OPENING IMAGE Two
hundred yards from his house No idea how he got here
He scrambles to his bare feet Confused He looks back
to his house -- hears a SCREAM His mother Fear rises

So he RUNS Just like we saw Primal alarms ringing
A silent prayer To run FASTER CRASH CUTTING INTO --

THE HOUSE -- Barry SLAMMING in -- SHOOTING into -- THE
LIVING ROOM -- to find --

HIS MOTHER DEAD ON THE FLOOR -- blood pooled around her
Lying next to the now-familiar KNIFE Young Barry looks
up to see

HIS FATHER HENRY ALLEN Standing over the body Tears
in his disbelieving eyes In shock

HENRY ALLEN

his heart into an extreme

Barry sees Iris but MOVING SLOWLY as if underwater
She’s speaking but her voice is SLOW What is happening

He sees his IV A DROP FROZEN in freefall He gently
TAPS the IV glass His slightest touch causes it to
SHATTER -- GLASS and LIQUID EXPLODING OUT -- THEN
SUDDENLY HANGING IN THE AIR -- STOPPED Frozen around

Everyone turns towards the author of this suggestion

EOBARD THAWNE 40s Philosophical Brilliant The

flanked by a silent TRIO OF MEN IN SUITS

THAWNE
The problem with doctors is they
only process information within

perception

He reaches out A HAND towards the MONITOR CONTROLS His

Or explode That much unstable
energy he should’ve popped like a

You just expended 17000 calories
Unless you want to drink thirty
milkshakes sit still and let your

The Team stands opposite Barry still in his

BARRY
You said youd help me get better
I’m better than I’ve ever been
But the city’s in a panic I have
to get back to work

Barry follows Tak’s eyes turning around to
THAWNE

Before you go I’d like to show
you something

INT STAR LABS - SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT

dress blues

see Thawne

The bowels of the facility The place not on the tour

THAWNE
We’ve much in common you and I
Both of our lives shattered at
fourteen Multiple sclerosis I
wasn’t supposed to live more than
six years Faced with a death
sentence I began working I
wanted to accomplish as much as I
could before my time ran out

BARRY
Then you understand why I have to
go back

THAWNE
Of course Youve lost another

person This time it was
Detective Chyre Before that your
mother to a savage murder-- your
father died in prison for a crime
you believe he was innocent of

He knows It catches Barry off-guard

BARRY
My father was a drunk not a
murderer Something happened that
night Right before she died
Something carried me away from the
house

FLASH Young Barry trying to close his bedroom window
Falling Being CARRIED That VOICE whispering

( )

BARRY
I know what I saw What I heard

FLASH Young Barry in the field Far from his house

THE VOICE
RUN FLASH

Hearing the SCREAM Starting to run

BARRY
The case is still open There was
a print on the weapon that wasn’t
my father’s

THAWNE
I believe you The more time I
spend in quantum physics the
more I learn anything is possible
Just see for yourself

They approach a huge metal door the size of a bank vault

INT STAR LABS - HIGH SECURITY CONTAINMENT - CONTINUOUS

Featureless and metal Empty except for a column of
cylindrical CONTAINERS rising out of the room’s center

THAWNE
This room contains artifacts
recovered from lightning storms
with significant Kanigher particle
discharges over the years

Thawne reaches for a cylinder which opens with a
hermetic hiss of air Hands its contents to Barry

THAWNE
This dollar bill was found in
Central City Park in 1954 After
one such storm Ordinary enough
Washington a pyramid Look
closer Examine

Barry considers Inspects Flips the bill over

BARRY
There’s no “In God we trust”

Thawne grins Opens another canister Pulls out two
METALLIC OBJECTS Gunmetal grey Curved on one side

( )

THAWNE
Spectro-analysis reveals the atoms
of this metal contain an
antiparticle that can’t even be
synthesized without instantly
annihilating itself

(then)

You told me when you were struck
by that bolt you saw things
What if I told you what you saw
was real Glimpses into our past
our future other times as well
another dimension

BARRY
A parallel universe

THAWNE
I believe these storms are where
the wall between our reality and
others is weakest And that
through them here we can cross
over

BARRY
(gets it)
Your Accelerator

THAWNE
I meant to fire a single proton
fast enough to cross through that
wall and into another universe
Now with you instead of sending
a proton I can send a man

Thawne fixes a stare You Barry is speechless

THAWNE

Youre the fastest man alive You
have the time to do anything
Stay with the department-- but
stay here too If you apply your
focus to this you could go places
no man ever dreamed possible

(finally)
Barry What if theres a world
where your mother is still alive

Barry cradles the strange metal Holding the

impossible

EXT STREETS - MORNING

Barry SUPER SPEEDS to work a free bird through an
obstacle course of miserable people stuck in traffic

Like a bike messenger with a jet pack angling between

INSIDE A bus -- a PASSENGER hears a BANG on the roof --
looks out only to see a newspaper eddying in the
contrail of a long gone Barry Allen

IRIS
Three minutes after I realized I

Youre a blogger now
IRIS

If the Citizen was still around
it’d be running a dozen stories
about the monster who murdered
Chyre

BARRY
Youre a blogger now

IRIS
He was my friend too This is
the only thing I can do for him

Iris moves to sit grabbing a chair with a broken wheel

IRIS
So I started digging --

FWOOSH -- Barry swaps the broken chair for another -- a
BLUR that gusts Iris’ hair into her face

BARRY
I had CSU dump the recording of
the killer’s video to my computer--

IRIS

There’s nothing there I already
scrubbed it And his hack into
the jumbotron was clean This guy
does not want to be found

chemicals And what the hell does
he want

You wouldn’t listen

He reaches into his pocket Pulls out A series of BLUE

AMPULES He takes one ROLLS it under his fingers on
the balustrade then lets go Letting it roll over

Down over the Mezzanine -- TO SMASH ON THE MARBLE FLOOR
BELOW In the middle of the commuter crush

BARRY (PRELAP)
There’s got to be a pattern

INT CSI BULLPEN - DAY

BARRY
A consistency to the victimology
And if we can’t trace his signal
what about his equipment You’d
need hardware to freeze a body
that fast but nothing’s been
recovered from the crime scenes

INT CENTRAL STATION - THAT MOMENT
A COMMUTER ON HIS CELL PHONE SLIPS Looks at the floor
COATED IN DARK ICE Odd Someone next to him stops

CHILLED Sees her BREATH in the air

THREE MORE AMPULES DROP FROM ABOVE -- SHATTERING ON THE
FLOOR Nothing but MIST spreading out where they land

They rush to get out of there Cell phone guy getting to

EXT CENTRAL CITY STREETS - 09 SECONDS LATER

Okay Barry Just go Take a
look And do what exactly

A wind tunnel stretches down the main drag of the city
Passing POLICE CARS heading right for -- CENTRAL STATION

INT CENTRAL STATION

The CROWD SCREAMS -- seeing the BLACK ICY WAVE spread up
the crumbling walls reaching the delicate glass ceiling

THE FIRST GLASS PANE SHATTERS -- EXPLODING DOWN -- MORE
FOLLOW -- HUGE KILLER CHUNKS OF GLASS AND IRON RAINING
DOWN ON THE HUNDREDS OF TERRIFIED PEOPLE BELOW WHEN --

TIME SNAPS STILL

The station is a RAINSTORM of BROKEN GLASS showering from
above -- like a million KNIVES HANGING IN THE AIR
ABOUT TO KILL EVERYONE

WHIP PAN -- Barry entering the station -- the only thing
in motion -- moving faster than anyone can see --

BARRY (VO)
Dozens of panes roughly 2200
pounds each Rate of descent 200
feet per second I have time

He runs under tries to move a falling piece of jagged
glass SLICES his hand

BARRY (VO)
Glass moves slow but it’s still
razor sharp Gotta be careful

He skids to a stop The glass shrapnel closer to the
civilians now

BARRY (VO)
Think Too many shards Can’t
move the panes

Eyes widen An epiphany

BARRY (VO)
Move the people

And he’s gone Tearing through the station -- MOVING
EVERYONE TO A CORNER PROTECTED BY THE MEZZANINE OVERHANG

The last person dropped to safety Barry looks across the
ocean of falling glass the pieces of vaulted ceiling
millimeters from SMASHING to see A MAN WITH A SEMI --

SNART Stopped in time Making an escape down one of
the train platform tunnels

( )

BARRY (VO)
It’s him Headed underground
(realizes)
For the trains

Barry begins MOVING THROUGH the falling pieces of glass
as they EXPLODE IN SLO-MO ALL AROUND HIM SPRAYING OUT --
DEADLY GLASS DUST SLICING HIS SKIN -- too much --

Barry huddles for safety as -- TIME RESUMES -- THE REST
OF THE CEILING GLASS BASHES TO THE FLOOR Barry covers
his mouth -- looks -- Snart is GONE

INT TRAIN PLATFORM - 002 SECONDS LATER

Snart moves fast heading for a train getting ready to
depart opposite an empty platform Not fast enough --

He’s WHISKED UP -- turns BARRY’S GOT HIM Snart SMILES
a steely grin Knowing what Barry doesn’t yet

CRACKLE AS A FIELD OF ICE SPREADS WIDE AND DEEP --

A TRAIN WHISTLE signals a train coming

SNART
You can’t save them all

The hell he can’t Barry makes a decision to LET SNART
GO A BURST OF SPEED and Barry is off -- DOWN THE TUNNEL
-- HEADED FOR THE COMING TRAIN

BARRY (VO)
Moving train Moving train How
do you stop a moving train

You don’t Same trick Only

FOR THE CONCRETE WALL

INSIDE THE CAR -- PEOPLE THROWN AT ODD ANGLES -- holding
on for dear life -- which would be very short but for --

BARRY -- TEARING THROUGH TAKING PASSENGERS OFF TO THE

SIDE OF THE TRACKS -- person by person -- dropping them
off safely -- too fast for anyone to know what happened
The train HITS -- the front end SMASHING -- an accordion

wave of violent inertia spreading down the entire length
of the train to destroy EVERYTHING on it

Then Barry sees -- ONE LAST WOMAN still on the train --
on a back car Her life about to be crushed out of her
as the train crushes down further and further

BARRY GOES IN AFTER HER -- GRABBING HER AS THE CAR
CRUMPLES AROUND THEM AND --

MAKING IT OUT THE INSTANT THE ENTIRE THING DISINTEGRATES
BEHIND HIM IN A VIOLENT CRASH SPEWING CHUNKS OF METAL
AND GLASS -- SHRAPNEL BURYING INTO BARRYS SHOULDER

ON THE PLATFORM

Barry gasps for air ignores the pain He still holds
the LAST WOMAN tightly -- who looks up at him shaken

LAST WOMAN
Something blew right through --

BARRY
Yeah Freak storm Must’ve been

Barry’s chest swells exhausted woozy but feeling
good He scans the crowd for Snart -- but SNART IS GONE

LAST WOMAN

Barry feels BLOOD dripping from HIS BACK HES WOUNDED

EXT CENTRAL STATION - MOMENTS LATER

carefully pained She’s over him sterilizing tongs

VALERIE
Hold still I’m pretty sure I’m
gonna make this hurt

She digs it in Barry winces through pain A lot of it

VALERIE
You think that’s bad You should
see what Thawne’d do to you if he
found out his precious specimen
was first responder to a train
derailment

She digs Bone CRUNCHES Barry lets out an Ow
VALERIE
It’s just a lag bolt four inches
into your trapezius
PLINK A METAL BOLT drops into a coffee mug on the

Somehow this bit of surgery is very intimate

No I think you can run faster

I keep asking Nathan when he’s
going to move back to London He
seems committed to Central City

NATHAN
I’m committed to Iris and she’s
committed here

GUEST
She needs a new job Just buy her
a paper in London

Laughter Conversation stops at a KNOCK

Barry at

the door Holding wine Iris is surprised to see him

IRIS
Barry You’re here

BARRY
You always complain I never come
to your monthly dinner parties

IRIS
Because you don’t

BARRY
Guess I made the time

Iris lets him in shocked to hear those words come out of

his mouth

LATER

Mid-meal everyone seated drinking Barry eyes Nathan’s
arm gently rubbing Iris’ back Drinks some more

GUEST
I was in a cab when it happened I
just as easily could have been on
that train

NATHAN
I hope you guys catch him before
anyone else gets hurt Barry

BARRY
We’re working on it

IRIS
People have no idea how bad it
could have been if --

( )

NATHAN
Here she goes again Iris has a
theory

Barry straightens Not liking this

NATHAN
She thinks someone saved those
people Her guardian angel

IRIS
I have proof --

NATHAN
And here I thought we might have a
meal without your laptop

No chance She already has it out and opened to THE
STILL IMAGE THE BLURRED FOOT

GUEST
I see it Is that a foot

IRIS
Exactly A foot

BARRY
That’s proof Of an invisible man
who saves people’s lives --

IRIS
Any crazier than a freak tornado

NATHAN
Come on honey You know it’s a
little out there

IRIS
(to Nathan)
You said earlier you believed me

NATHAN
Because I’m crazy about you I’11
believe anything you say

Barry’s eyes flick to Nathan’s hand around Iris’ waist

BARRY
Let’s play this theory out For
one man --
(sets a salt shaker)
To cover the entire station -- And

save all those people --
(the silverware)
(MORE)

( )

BARRY (CONTD)
He’d need to trace 100 meters
times 300 reducing at a steady
rate as the train closes to
impact all in a space of 10
seconds putting him at a
footspeed in excess of 400
miles per hour Is that
scientifically precedented
Yes actually Every year at
Christmas when Santa Claus gets
presents to every kid in the world
by morning You should definitely
write about this on your blog

Iris goes quiet made to feel stupid

IRIS
It was just a theory

Everyone clocks the tension Especially Nathan

INT FRONT DOOR - LATER

NATHAN
It’s been years Why do you still
try with him

IRIS

died He was the smartest kid in
the world excited about
everything Then life took all
that away I guess I just feel
sorry for him

NATHAN
Are you sure that’s all it is

( )

Iris reads him

IRIS
What do you mean

NATHAN
You’re the only one who can make
me that upset-- and it’s because I
love you

IRIS
(moves to him)
I promise to get pissed at you
more often Nathan he’s just
an old friend That’s it

Someone else with your speed
How’s that even possible

Barry shakes his head No idea

VALERIE
And why engineer a prison break
Why go after you He could’ve
killed you why didn’t he--

BARRY
It doesnt matter It’s over

VALERIE
Because another guy can run fast
Cold was a hell of a lot tougher
and we --

BARRY
We It’s just me out there It’s
just me And I’m saying I’m done

Val looks to the guys -- A little help Tak shrugs
McGee stands -- done here too

MCGEE
You want to stop now Fine I
have better things to do

And he’s gone A beat -- and Tak follows suit Leaving
Barry and Val alone

VALERIE
I thought you never gave up The
whole point of you is you never
give up --

BARRY

It’s not that simple I can’t
keep doing this Val

( )

VALERIE
Why Why this guy We trained
you outfitted you helped you --
we risked everything and we did
it -- I did it -- because I
believe in what you’re doing --

BARRY
He killed my mother if I don’t
stop he’1ll kill --

For the briefest moment Val thinks he might mean her

VALERIE
Iris He’1ll kill Iris

Yes
VALERIE
Youd let this city die just to
save her You must really love
her
He does

VALERIE
Well that’s good It’s good to
care about someone like that

And Val leaves done with Barry Barry watches her go
passing THAWNE An understanding look

THAWNE
It was inevitable People with
gifts like you like me
there’s no peace for us anywhere
except in their expression This
is what I’ve been trying to show
you

(then)

You spent your life running away
from the past It’s time you
found something to run towards
and it’s right here

PRELAP ELECTRICAL SPARKS -- MINIATURE LIGHTNING --

INT ACCELERATOR - DAY
Coming off BARRY as he RUNS Shedding lightning

Shredding around the track Thawne watches from the
platform as Barry PUSHES The world falling away

( )

Reality FRAYS at the seams in front of him giving way
to THE SPEED FORCE

FLASH THE SAME IMAGE OF NORA ALLEN IN HER KITCHEN
BAKING SHES OLDER BUT HAPPY A FACE UNTOUCHED BY
LIFES BRUTALITY

Barry reaches out to her -- THEN SLAMS BACK TO normal
time running out his inertia on the track Exhausted
BARRY

(disappointed)

I didn’t hit lightspeed--

THAWNE
No You didn’t But close

He sees Barry’s disappointment

THAWNE
The Accelerator will push you the
rest of the way propel you even
faster Faster than light
(then)
Relax Go home Sleep Youve
earned it

He claps Barry on the back seeing him off STAY WITH
Thawne focusing on A CONTAINMENT UNIT

Filled to capacity WITH ENERGY ALIVE WITH IT

INT HOSPITAL HALL - DAY
Nathan walks with Iris’ help Weak but getting there

IRIS
Youre pushing it

NATHAN
I’ve spent enough time in a
hospital bed I need practice if
I’m going to make it down the
aisle in a month

IRIS
You’re amazing You were almost
killed because I didn’t want to be
unemployed and you still want to
marry me

NATHAN
Iris please You don’t have
anything to be sorry about

( )

But Nathan can see Iris’ guilt pains her

NATHAN
I need to tell you something And
I’m not sure you’1l still want to
marry me when I’m done
(beat)
The killer wasn’t there for you
He was there for me

Iris stops -- shaken --

She damns

IRIS
But the only connection between
any of them was
(realizing)
Money

NATHAN
The Accelerator is the biggest
engineering project in the history
of the state A lot of moving
parts Some fully transparent and
others less They needed a
black budget A fund to pay
people to make changes to the
Accelerator All work done in
secret

IRIS
What kind of changes

NATHAN
I don’t know But the names and
amounts came directly from STAR
Labs

IRIS
You laundered money to pay people
to do something with the
Accelerator -- and they all ended
up dead

him with a look He bows his head

NATHAN
I was the only person who’d seen
the list and could make the
connection That’s why Cold came
after me I’m sorry If Id told
anyone sooner some of those
people might still be alive

He stops

He sees the look on her face as if he was a stranger

INT STAR LABS - PARTICLE ANALYSIS LAB - NIGHT

Val still stung stops at her workstation SNART’S
DEVICE in pieces on it Her eyes lock on a component
She turns it in her fingers Making a connection

INT BARRY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Iris just reoriented Barry’s world Barry takes it in

BARRY
It doesn’t make sense I thought
Nathan was just a financier

IRIS
Turns out sometimes people in
finance aren’t entirely honest
Who knew

BARRY
But it doesn’t add up You hire
people to modify the Accelerator
in secret then kill them Why

IRIS
There’s only one reason I can
think of

INT ACCELERATOR - NIGHT

Val walks the enormous Accelerator tunnel A glassed
cavern spanning miles nearly complete She examines the
track the SHIELDING

IRIS (VO)
The Accelerator’s been modified to
do something it’s not supposed to

INSIDE An intricate PARTICLE ARRAY MAGNETS holding a
CHARGE IN PLASMA SUSPENSION

IRIS (VO)
Something someone didn’t want
found out

Val continues as if finishing Iris’ thought

VALERIE (PRELAP)
It was very well hidden

INT THAWNE’S OFFICE - NIGHT

ON VAL explaining nervously She holds the swirling
light containment unit full of Kanigher plasma

VALERIE
I found it looking for a link
between Cold and the Accelerator
You said the tech Cold used is
based on the same semiconductor
systems array coolant we designed
for the Accelerator only in
miniature

REVEAL she is speaking to Thawne Thawne is physically
upset by this His hands begin to TREMBLE with the news

VALERIE
Which means there’s a connection
between our work here and all
those murders

THAWNE
A design similarity isn’t enough
to --

VALERIE

I followed the radiation shielding
-- it’s all been retrofitted to
siphon Kanigher particles

Someone -- with a connection to
Cold -- modified the Accelerator
THAWNE

(beat seeing it)
But who -- who would do that

Val sees his tremor Pours him a glass of water fits it
into his hand to help him drink A sad beat

VALERIE
Jerry Hes the Accelerator’s
design lead He built the cooling
system He altered the system to
store the Kanigher particles
generated during Barry’s run It
makes the Accelerator ten times
more powerful but it wasn’t
designed to contain that much
energy If let it reach full
capacity it could initiate a
complete gravitational collapse
A singularity A universe killer

( )

The horrific thought settles Without warning Thawne

unsnaps his chair’s arm restraints -- rubbing his wrists
VALERIE

Are you all right I’11 get help
Val turns -- but stops suddenly -- eyes wide at seeing
THAWNE STANDING IN FRONT OF HER Vibrating impossibly
fast Everything about him darkens

THAWNE
Shame Right in every detail

Without warning a GASH opens on Val’s face

THAWNE
Except it wasn’t Dr McGee

Thawne standing BESIDE her now She gasps Blood seeps
Another SWIPE Another GASH

THAWNE
I was stealing Barry’s speed I
was in particular need of it

Two more SLASHES just like he killed the prison guards

VALERIE
I dont understand

Blood spills from her abdomen Val drops to her knees

THAWNE
Simple dear I want to go home

Another SLASH -- as we SMASH BACK TO

INT BARRY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Barry considers Not sure anymore
IRIS
Barry something is very wrong
with STAR Labs You need to stop
it -- the Flash needs to stop it
BARRY
I can’t I can’t be the Flash
anymore

He looks away Ashamed

( )

BARRY
There’s another man He’s faster
than me And he’1ll hurt you if I
run again

Iris fixes a look Thousands of emotions in her eyes

IRIS
Screw that Central City needs
the Flash The world does I’m
not putting myself before the
world
(touches his face)
Barry Allen taught me that

She looks at him With love He feels her touch on his
cheek loving it Just then -- Barry’s PHONE RINGS He
answers Iris watches as Barry goes white

IRIS

( )

MCGEE
You have to believe me

Barry does Barry knows the sound of an innocent man
Charged Barry moves to Morillo

BARRY
McGee didn’t do this You’ve got
the wrong guy

MORILLO
Her blood’s all over him and I’ve
got a motive She was accusing
him of tampering with the
Accelerator project Dr Thawne
gave a statement himself --

Barry hears that Putting it together Finally seeing
the connection The only possible explanation

BARRY
It was Thawne He’s the only one
who could have done this

Right The guy in the wheelchair
How’d I miss the obvious suspect --

But then -- a BRIGHT EXPLOSION shatters the horizon A

Hello Barry

THAWNE
Youve gotten faster

You were the one You killed
them My mother -- Chyre -- Val --

THAWNE
You’re an understanding fellow
I’m only trying to get home again
After you trapped me here

THE FLASH
I’ve never even met you

THAWNE
Oh we have quite the history you
and I Old friends In another
draft of reality I siphoned your
speed just as I did here I
wasn’t like you I wasn’t picked

EXT ROCKY MOUNTAIN FOOTHILLS - DAY (FLASHBACK)

his metal insignia) trades speed-punches with THE FLASH
But not our Flash His crimson suit brighter metallic

worked miracles I had everything
You tried to stop me

An epic fight And chase So fast reality begins to
unravel around them Energy rippling off of this Flash
like air around a nosecone

UNTIL THEY ENTER THE SPEED FORCE -- TOGETHER

THAWNE (VO)
--you were always so damn fast --
you ripped the wall open and ran
right into the Speed Force with
me drafting in your wake

-- TUMBLING OUT OF THE SPEED FORCE

INT ACCELERATOR - RESUMING

THAWNE
I fell out of the stream and ended
up here My speed draining
bleeding away Stranding me ina
world where you were still a boy
and hadn’t yet inherited speed for
me to steal So I had to wait
prepare I built this Accelerator
so I could make my way home

INT CELL - PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY (FLASHBACK)

tracks A damaged soul looking
for guidance --

INT ACCELERATOR - RESUMING

THAWNE
Something I’m good at getting
people to realize their potential
Like you I needed you to run
so I could steal your speed

The Accelerator hits 80 85 Thawne moves towards
the Track Flash grabs him -- THROWS him back

THAWNE
That’s why I never killed you
Barry I needed you alive I
needed you to keep running So
that I could

Thawne strikes -- Flash ducks it -- faster A better
match this time as they SPEED FIGHT

BARRY
The Accelerator -- it’1ll rip open
a black hole -- it’1ll destroy
everything -- You’d destroy this
world just to get home

No This universe
Thawne looks -- in the center of the Accelerator SNART

HAS IRIS His HYPO GUN pointed at her neck

THE FLASH
If he hurts her

THAWNE
What’s it going to be Save your
Iris or save your world

The Accelerator reaches 95 Nearly there

IRIS
Forget about me Stop him We’re
all dead if you don’t

THAWNE
You won’t stand to watch her die
I know you too well Flash
That’s why I kept her alive

Flash chooses Iris -- racing toward her -- JUST AS SNART
PULLS THE TRIGGER

Flash races to beat the HYPO NEEDLE -- BACKHANDS the hypo
away from Iris -- INTO SNARTS CHEST

Snart feels it in his heart -- sees the COLD SPREAD OUT
Working up his neck to his face Just enough time to
register surprise then ECSTASY

SNART
So warm

The killer falls frozen dead Flash looks --

Thawne is running the track shedding lightning

Flash frees Iris from her restraints as -- Thawne’s run
turns the Accelerator Track into a VORTEX of energy It
CLIMBS rising reaching THE APEX OF THE TOWER

A SWIRLING VORTEX forming MILES ABOVE the Track Reality
BENDING towards its heart Incredible Horrifying

EXT CENTRAL CITY - THAT MOMENT

The energy off the Tower is so bright night turns to

day A WIND builds blowing TOWARDS THE VORTEX First
leaves newspaper

Then a CAR shifts towards it

INT ACCELERATOR - THAT MOMENT

The entire structure trembles with earthquake intensity
The Vortex revolves high above -- RIPPING A HOLE OPEN IN
SPACE

The eye of a hurricane IGNITES REPLACED WITH THE EVENT
HORIZON OF THE BEGINNINGS OF A BLACK HOLE

Carrying Iris Flash fights the Vortex’s insane pull --
RACING them towards the center of the Accelerator TRACK --
the safer eye of the storm

Even here the Vortex’s pull is fierce -- Iris’ feet shoot
out from under her -- sucked up feet first Flash YANKS
open an maintenance shaft access panel in the track
THE FLASH
It’s shielded -- stay here --

He lowers her in About to refasten the hatch when --

IRIS
What about you
THE FLASH
I have to stop it --
IRIS
How How do you unwind a black
hole
THE FLASH

Same way you unwind a tornado

She reaches up pulls his mask off Wanting to look into
his eyes for the last time

THE FLASH
There are a million universes you
know I’ve loved you in every
single one of them

Barry looks to the expanding black hole whirling high
above Makes a decision He puts his mask back on

He takes off Speeding around the Track up the WALLS --
Until he’s racing at the top of the Tower against the
black hole’s spiral just like he unwound the tornado

EXT CENTRAL CITY

Atoms tear off people -- cars -- buildings -- PULLED
towards the Tower -- nuclear blast force

INTEXT ACCELERATOR TOWER - THAT MOMENT

WITH THE FLASH -- RUNNING -- straining -- pushing himself
to the limits of possibility

LIGHTNING flies in his wake -- earth-shattering Pieces
of his suit -- his flesh -- disintegrate off like dust

Hes being pulled bit by bit into the black hole --
even as he runs GLOWING BRIGHTER with each stride

THE BLACK HOLE BEGINS TO DISSIPATE

He’s doing it Moving so fast the laws of relativity
take over -- breaking down his body -- stretching him
thin But still running Fans of the comic know

The Flash doesnt survive moments like these

He pours it on Anything to save the world To save
Iris Everything in his life distilled down to just

whats in front of him -- until --

THE BLACK HOLE EXPLODES WITH RAW ENERGY -- leaving the
world safe again -- PITCHING Flash back --

INTO THE SPEED FORCE --

Disoriented but intact -- in the whirl of light and speed
-- WINDOWS to other worlds blurring by Then up ahead --

Thawne Running toward an opening -- a window to a
FAMILIAR WORLD -- thinking himself home free

Glances back seeing Flash

THAWNE
No

Its on now A footrace through spacetime A chase
without roads or even terrain Two bolts of lightning
racing through infinity

Flash catches Thawne -- TACKLING HIM They tumble --
SPEED FIGHTING -- Flash more than his equal this time --

Thawne spends all his remaining strength on a single
BURST OF BLISTERING SPEED firing himself at Flash -- a
500 MILLION MPH bullet

( )

THE FLASH
You’re done running
FLASH BENDS -- FASTER THAN THAWNE FASTER THAN THOUGHT --
using Thawne’s inertia to send him flying past -- FALLING

INTO THE SPEED FORCE

Thawne fights against it Torn apart molecule by
molecule Consumed by the Speed Force

Until theres nothing left of Eobard Thawne Not even
hate With his final SCREAM THAWNE EXPLODES OUT IN
WHITE LIGHT The wave of energy BLASTS towards Flash

Flash turns to escape He cant Caught in the Speed
Forces wake Powerless against its numinous magnitude

Flashs world turns WHITE UNTIL HE’S LOST IN THE LIGHT
He opens his eyes To find he’s in

SPACE FRAYING IN HIS WAKE THE SOFT FLORESCENCE OF THE
SPEED FORCE BREAKING ALL AROUND HIM LIKE A NEW DAWN THE
DOORWAY TO ENDLESS WORLDS AHEAD OF HIM
THE FLASH (VO)
In the blink of an eye I can
see forever

A BOLT OF LIGHTNING CRASHES AND WE

SMASH TO CREDITS

AFTER CREDITS ROLL

EXT CITY STREETS

The Flash runs -- sees something ahead -- skids into a
hockey stop sending asphalt SPRAYING

But the spray STOPS IN THE AIR -- landing on a GREEN
SURFACE BRILLIANT LIGHT GIVEN SOLID FORM

The light drops The dust settles
GREEN LANTERN floats over the ground arms folded

HAL GREEN LANTERN
Lightspeed Not bad

THE END
