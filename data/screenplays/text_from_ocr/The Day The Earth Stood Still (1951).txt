the Empire -- from all over the world
The Government have not yet issued a
statement but there seems to be no
question that there actually is a

large unidentified object circling

the earth at incredible speed

This announcer keeps talking but his voice fades out and
now we hear the words the American announcer is saying

excitement)

where its from - but we do know
theres something there Its been
tracked around the world by radar
traveling at a rate of four thousand
miles an hour

INT WASHINGTON RADIO STATION

4TH RADIO REPORTER

(with deliberately

controlled calm)

Here in the nations capital there

is anxiety and concern but no outward
sign of panic As a matter of fact
there are signs of normalcy that

seem strangely out of place the
beautiful spring weather the tourist
crowds at the various monuments and
public buildings

EXT LINCOLN MEMORIAL - LONG SHOT (STOCK)

A small crowd of tourists is climbing the steps to the
columned entrance

EXT WASHINGTON MONUMENT - LONG SHOT (STOCk)

shots that we are unconscious of it
EXT JEFFERSON MEMORIAL - LONG SHOT (STOCK)

Crowds are strolling on the Mall and across the well-kept
lawns in front of the Smithsonian Institution with the
leisurely meandering quality that distinguishes sight-seers

MED SHOT

Including several small groups of people moving toward the
Smithsonian Their attention is attracted as the hum off
scene becomes a roar The sound is unearthly in its intensity
and almost unbearable in its swiftly increasing volume The
people stop in their tracks and look up in the sky in terror

MED CLOSE SHOT

Several people on the steps of the Smithsonian have turned
to look There is cold frozen fear in their eyes The awful
sound keeps increasing in volume

sees and hears

LONG SHOT

People scatter madly in all directions as the huge spaceship
comes in for a landing on a smooth grassy area The
tremendous roar of its motors is suddenly cut off and the
great ship settles gently to a perfect landing

MED SHOT - THE SHIP

The gleaming surface of the ship shows no break of any kind --
no windows no ports not even the outline of a hatch It is

a fearsome terrifying object giving no evidence of its

source or its intention

LONG SHOT - (FROM PARALLEL)

Shooting down on a section of lawn showing the varying
reactions of people to the landing Some are still running
madly away others singly and in little groups stand as
though rooted staring at the ship from a respectful distance

As he stares at the ship with fascination and horror Hed
like to run but he cant His mouth twitches and he emits a

nervous little laugh

INT RADIO AND TELEVISION STUDIO - MED SHOT

A nationally known news commentator -- for purposes of this
script lets say Drew Pearson -- is seated before a radio

mike He is also being photographed by TV cameras In a wall
near him is a TV screen which shows what is going out on the
air During the ensuing speech a man comes in a hands him a
sheaf of news bulletins

PEARSON

Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen

this special radio-television

broadcast to give you the latest
information on the landing of the
space ship in Washington

CLOSE SHOT - PEARSON

PEARSON

Government and Defense Department
officials are concerned by reports

of panic in several large Eastern
cities am authorized to assure

you that so far there is no reasonable
cause for alarm The rumors of
invading armies and mass destruction
are based on hysteria and are
absolutely false repeat -- these
rumors are absolutely false

ANOTHER ANGLE

PEARSON
The ship designed for travel outside
the earths atmosphere landed in
Washington today at 347 pm Eastern
Standard Time We still dont know
where it came from but can reveal
that military leaders are considering
two possibilities that it came from
some unfriendly power here on earth --
or that it actually arrived from

another planet

CAMERA PANS to and DOLLIES IN on the TV screen in the wall
On the screen is a shot of the space ship

PEARSONS VOICE

The ship is resting exactly where it
landed two hours ago and there has
been no sign of life from inside it

OUR CAMERAL HOLDS on the TV screen The cuts that follow are

MED SHOT - POLICE CORDON

Cops are holding back a section of a large crowd some
distance away from the ship The people are wide-eyed and

Behind police lines there is a large
crowd of curiosity seekers

SERIES OF INDIVIDUAL CUTS

1 Civilians in the crowd their eyes and nerves taut with
suspense

lips nervously his eyes never leaving the ship

3 A tank commander blinks from the tension of staring at an
unmoving object

4 The last cut is of the ship itself

PEARSONS VOICE

As you can see for yourself the
Army has taken every precaution to
meet whatever the situation may
require Every eye -- every weapon --
is trained on the ship Its been
this way for two hours and the tension--
CLOSE SHOT - PEARSON

as he interrupts himself excitedly his attention riveted on
the TV screen

PEARSON
Just a minute ladies and gentlemen
think see something moving

EXT THE MALL - MED LONG SHOT - DAY

We are at the actual location now not looking at TV We see

the ship surrounded by soldiers two medium tanks two

artillery pieces and a couple of machine guns Some distance

away is a suggestion of the crowd of civilians held back by

police Prominent in the scene are newsreel and television

cameras OUR CAMERA MOVES IN to MED SHOT As it does so we
see a couple of metal objects rising slowly from the top of

the ship One which is an oddly-designed coil of wire slides

up and revolves slowly The other is a section of vented

pipe with a convex cap on it

REVERSE ANGLE

on the soldiers their eyes glued to this first sign of
activity from the ship They shift uneasily gripping their
rifles more firmly

MED SHOT - THE SHIP

After a long tense moment a ramp appears silently out of
the side of the ship and slides down to the ground There is
an audible gasp as a man appears at the top of the ramp He
looks around at the crowd with cool and imperturbable dignity
This is KLAATU He is completely human in appearance The
only unearthly thing about him is his clothing He wears a
tunic that is very good looking but at the same time
thoroughly comfortable and practical On his head is a metal
helmet that obscures most of his face (It would be impossible
to identify him later) The design of this helmet gives the
impression that it is more a formal headdress than for
protection Klaatu is above all an impressive man -- a man

of tremendous dignity and presence He has the tolerant
superiority that comes with absolute knowledge

INDIVIDUAL REACTION CUTS

of soldiers people in the crowd and policemen The newsreel
and TV men are busy at their cameras

MED CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

After an impressive moment he raises his arms in the
universal gesture of neutrality Then he speaks in perfect
English his voice amplified as though through an enunciator

KLAATU
We have come to visit you in peace --
and with good will

Klaatu walks slowly down the ramp toward the soldiers As he
does so he draws from inside his tunic a strange looking
object longish and tubular It might be a a telescope -- or

it might be some strange kind of weapon

MED SHOT

shooting from the side showing Klaatu advancing slowly toward
the line of soldiers He holds out the mysterious object in

front of him in a gesture that is actually one of offering

but could be misinterpreted as menacing There is a growing
uneasy rumble of muttering among the soldiers as Klaatu
advances They are clearly frightened of what he may do
CLOSE SHOT - PLATOON LEADER

A young second lieutenant standing in front of his platoon
As Klaatu advances the lieutenant unslings his carbine

MED SHOT

Klaatu starts toward the platoon leader raising the object

he holds toward the man trying to make clear his intentions
Misinterpreting this as a menacing gesture the platoon leader
raises his carbine to his shoulder

MED CLOSE SHOT

of one of the tank commanders in the turret of his tank He
is watching Klaatu advancing toward the platoon leader and
he has drawn his pistol Convinced that the lieutenant is in
jeopardy the tank commander aims at Klaatu and fires

MED SHOT

as Klaatu falls to the ground wounded The object he was
holding has dropped from his hand and smashed The soldiers
start to gather around Klaatu excitedly when suddenly there
appears in the entrance to the space ship a huge robot There
is a gasp of amazement from the crowd and the solders draw
back at sight of him The robot is ten feet tall is made in

the almost-perfect image of a man He is to be played by an
actor and his flesh appears to be made of a greenish metal
His eyes flash as though lighted internally His perfectly-
fashioned muscular body is covered only with a loincloth
This is GORT

There are cries of amazement as Gort walks slowly ponderously
down the ramp to the ground As he does so the ramp closes
behind him Gorts face is and always remains utterly
expressionless He stops to look at Klaatu lying on the

ground Then he looks around at the soldiers the tanks and
guns All the guns have been traversing to follow him
CLOSE SHOT - GORT

From inside him there comes an ominous crackling sound as
though power were being generated within him His eyes flash
toward the tank from which Klaatu was shot

MED CLOSE SHOT - TANK

There is a great metallic clatter and the Sherman tank is
suddenly reduced to a pile of junk metal its parts completely
disintegrated Only a piece of tank track and twisted gun
barrel emerge from the heap on the ground to identify what
had been there The tanks crew has remained unharmed

CLOSE SHOT - GORT

The crackling sound continues as his eyes start to sweep in
a semicircle taking in all the troops

MED SHOT - THE TROOPS

SHOOTING FROM BEHIND Gort with the back of his head in fg
CAMERA PANS to follow Gorts sweeping gaze In a growing
crash and clatter of metal every weapon in sight is

destroyed The two machine guns are little heaps of junk

The 75s are larger heaps The second tank like the first

is a three-foot pile of scrap Rifles have dropped from the

soldiers hands and lie on the ground as little mounds of

wood and metal None of the men has been harmed but their
faces show the utter terror of what they have experienced

ANOTHER ANGLE - THE TROOPS
as they react to the full shock of what has happened Most

of them stand rooted to the ground Several laugh
hysterically A few break and run wildly
MED SHOT - CROWD OF CIVILIANS

Sudden pandemonium breaks out Utterly terrified by what
they have witnessed the crowd becomes a wild milling
screaming mob concerned only with escape

MED CLOSE SHOT - GORT

He is walking slowly deliberately menacingly toward the
tank commander who fired on Klaatu Standing by the debris
of his tank the man is immobilized with terror The robot
starts to reach out to grab him

CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

lying on the ground He speaks to Gort sharply in a strange
language

KLAATU
Gort Deglet ovrosco

MED CLOSE SHOT - GORT

He pauses obediently in the act of reaching out for the tank
commander Dropping his arms he stands motionless and remains
that way

MED CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

He has raised himself to a sitting position on the ground

his wounded shoulder giving him considerable pain The two
platoon leaders come into scene hesitantly badly shaken by
the awesome demonstration of power they have seen They are
uncertain as to what they should do The platoon leader eyes
the smashed object on the ground curiously and turns
questioningly to Klaatu With great dignity Klaatu picks up

the broken object which we see well for the first time It
is a delicately-made tubular telescope badly smashed On it
are indications of small electronic gadgets

KLAATU

It was a gift For your President
(glances at the broken

object ruefully)

With this he could have studied life
on other planets

Klaatu lets the object drop with a shrug of mild exasperation
The two lieutenants exchange a helpless look of bewilderment
Then Klaatu raises himself to his feet painfully holding

his wounded shoulder As he does so a colonel and a captain
come into scene

COLONEL
(to the lieutenants)
Is he all right

FIRST PLATOON LEADER
Got hit in the shoulder sir

The three junior officers exchange ineffectual glances and
look to the colonel who thinks for a moment before making
his decision

COLONEL

Send for an ambulance Get him to

Walter Reed Hospital right away

CAPTAIN
Yes sir

INT SITTING ROOM - WALTER REED HOSPITAL - NIGHT
There is a door to the corridor and a door to Klaatus room

In the small sitting room talking in tones of hushed concern
is a group of men Theres a Major General a likable man
with a chest full of ribbons There are also a Colonel in
command of the hospital a high-ranking police officer a
couple of medical officers and two civilians The conversation
is interrupted by the entrance from Klaatus room of a Medical
Corps Major followed by an Army Nurse

GENERAL
(to Major)
How is he

MAJOR WHITE

Hes all right General Blood
pressures a little high but it
could be aggravation

GENERAL

(wryly)

Cant blame him always get mad
when somebody shoots me

MAJOR WHITE
He still wants to see the President

COLONEL

(to General)

We informed the White House over an
hour ago

GENERAL

(to Major)

Didnt drop any hints about where
hes from did he

MAJOR WHITE
No sir he didnt
The door to the corridor opens and a worried young Captain
enters

CAPTAIN

Excuse me

(to the Colonel)

What about the reporters Colonel
Theyre swarming all over the lobby

The Colonel turns in deference to the General

GENERAL

(quietly)

Tell them there wont be any statement
tonight

CAPTAIN

Yes sir

(glancing down the

corridor)

Mr Harleys here from the White
House

Harley appears in the doorway a brief case under his arm
Hes a dignified intelligent member of the White House
secretariat He proceeds uninterruptedly into the room
nodding cordially to the General

HARLEY
General --

GENERAL

(indicating Klaatus
room)

Right in there Mr Harley

Harley proceeds in businesslike fashion to the door He knocks
and then enters
INT HOSPITAL ROOM - FULL SHOT

as Harley enters closing the door behind him Klaatu no
longer wears his helmet and we see his face clearly for the
first time Even sitting up in bed with his shoulder strapped
in bandages he is a figure of great authority His face
reflects inner dignity and assurance Harley who is a
hardened diplomatist cant help being impressed by his
present assignment and a little awed by Klaatu Harley
obviously has been sent by the President to find out what he
can Klaatus eyes study him cool penetrating reserved

HARLEY

My name is Harley -- Secretary to
the President

(Klaatu continues to

study him silently)

Ive been told that you speak our

language -- that your name is Mr
Klaatu

KLAATU
(coolly)
Just Klaatu

HARLEY

The President asked me to convey his
deepest apologies for what has
happened We all feel--

KLAATU
(evenly)
Sit down Mr Harley

Somewhat relieved Harley seats himself He speaks with a
half smile hoping to ease the tension
HARLEY

Im sure dont have to point out
that your arrival was something of a
surprise

(getting a little

smile from Klaatu

he is encouraged to

do some fishing)

Had you been traveling long

KLAATU
About five months -- your months

HARLEY
You must have come a long way

KLAATU
About 250 million of your miles

Harley glances at him quickly to be sure hes not joking
Hes not

HARLEY
Naturally were very curious to know
where it is you come from

KLAATU

(easily hes a

diplomat too)

From another planet Lets just say
that were neighbors

Harley reacts as his wildest assumptions are so blandly
corroborated

HARLEY
Its rather difficult for us to think
of another planet as a neighbor

KLAATU

Im afraid in the present situation
youll have to learn to think that
way

HARLEY
(eyebrows raised)
The present situation

KLAATU
mean the reasons for my coming
here

HARLEY

(his eagerness apparent)

Were very curious about that too
Would you care to talk about it

KLAATU

Id be glad to

(noticing that Harley

is settling himself

expectantly)

Not now of course -- with you alone

HARLEY
Perhaps youd rather discuss it
personally with the President--

KLAATU

(somewhat sharply)

This is not a personal matter Mr
Harley It concerns all the people
on your planet

HARLEY
(Startled by the scope
of this statement)
-- Im not sure understand--

KLAATU
want to meet with representatives
from all the nations of the Earth

HARLEY

(shocked and perturbed

by this notion)

Im afraid that would be a little
awkward Its -- its completely
without precedent And there are
practical considerations -- the time
involved -- the enormous distances

KLAATU

(coolly)

traveled 250 million miles What
about your United Nations

HARLEY

(Surprised and a little

puzzled)

You know about the United Nations

KLAATU

Weve been monitoring your radio
broadcasts for a good many years
Thats how we learned your languages
Lately weve been getting your
television also

HARLEY

(wryly)

You must have a rather strange
impression of us
KLAATU

(smiling)

The first two years of television we
were convinced that all you did was
wrestle

Harley smiles Then his mind reverts to the seriousness of
the situation and he speaks gravely

HARLEY

Im sure you recognize from our broad-
casts the evil forces that have
produced the tension in our world
Surely you would agree--

KLAATU

(evenly)

am not concerned Mr Harley with
the internal affairs of your planet

consider that to be your business --
not mine

HARLEY
was only hoping to make you
understand

KLAATU

(sternly impressively)

My mission here is not to solve your
petty squabbles It concerns the
existence of every last creature who
lives on Earth

HARLEY
(uncomfortably)
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
KLAATU

intend to explain To all the
nations -- simultaneously

(his manner precludes
opposition)

How do we proceed Mr Harley

Harley is thoroughly shaken The tremendous force and power
implicit in Klaatuss manner preclude the possibility of
argument

HARLEY

(after a long

thoughtful moment)

We could call a special meeting of
the General Assembly But of course
the UN doesnt represent all of the
nations

KLAATU
Then why not a meeting of all the
Chiefs of State

HARLEY

(helplessly but

patiently)

Believe me you dont understand
They wouldnt sit down at the same
table

Growing a little impatient with such nonsense Klaatu eyes
him evenly speaks with Jovian authority

KLAATU

dont want to resort to threats
Mr Harley simply tell you bluntly
that the future of your planet is at
stake suggest you transmit that
message to the nations of the Earth

The eyes of the two men meet for a long silent moment Then
Harley rises quietly

HARLEY

will make that recommendation to
the President

(he picks up his brief

case and hat)

must tell you in all honesty that
Im extremely dubious about the
results

KLAATU

(with a half-smile)

Apparently Im not as cynical about
Earths people as you are

HARLEY

Ive been dealing in Earths politics

a good deal longer than you have

(he bows)

Goodnight sir

He turns and goes out

CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

He stares after Harley for a moment puzzled by this strange
and apparently unreasoning world he has come to He shakes
his head in thoughtful tolerant bewilderment

Searchlights have lighted up up the eerie shapes of the space
ship and Gort A circle of soldiers guard the area while a
crew of men can be seen working around the ship

MED CLOSE SHOT - AT SHIP

A Master Sergeant of Engineers dressed in fatigues is
inspecting the side of the ship carefully He has an acetylene
torch in his had and a welding helmet over his face The
Major General previously seen in the hospital sitting room
enters and speaks to the Sergeant

GENERAL
Getting any place Sergeant

SERGEANT

(raising his helmet)

No sir

(shaking his head in

annoyance)

Beats me General saw that ramp
come out of the side of the ship --
right here Now cant even find a
crack

A man named Carlson a civilian metallurgical expert comes
into scene The General nods to him

GENERAL
Whats the report Carlson

CARLSON

(discouraged)

Weve tried everything from a
blowtorch to a diamond drill

GENERAL
(nodding toward Gort)
What about him
CARLSON
Hes made out of the same stuff

THREE SHOT GENERAL CARLSON AND SERGEANT

GENERAL
Has he moved

SERGEANT
No sir Not an inch

CARLSON

This is the toughest material ever
saw General For hardness and
strength its out of this world

The two men exchange an uneasy glance then turn to look at
the ship

Two Medical Corps officers a Captain and a Major are
interestedly studying a series of X-ray films

MAJOR

The skeletal structure is completely
normal

Same for the major organs - heart

CAPTAIN

And the lungs are the same as ours
Must mean a similar atmosphere --
similar pressure

(nodding toward

Klaatus room)

How old do you think he is

MAJOR
Oh Id say forty-five

CAPTAIN

(smiling)

He told me this morning when
examined him Hes seventy-eight

MAJOR
dont believe it

CAPTAIN
Their life expectancy is a hundred
and thirty

MAJOR
How does he explain that

CAPTAIN

He says their medicine is that much
more advanced

(the major stares at

him blankly)

He was very nice about it But he
made me feel like a third-class witch
doctor

The door to Klaatus rooms opens and Major White appears
Hes the man who attended Klaatu the day before He closes
the door behind him and stands motionless facing the other
two his face wearing a blank expression

MAJOR WHITE
took a bullet out of that mans
arm yesterday

FIRST MAJOR
What about it

MAJOR WHITE

(utterly bewildered)

just examined the wound and its
all healed

FIRST MAJOR
What does he say about it

MAJOR WHITE

Said he put some salve on it -- some
stuff he had with him

(shows them a small

odd-looking tube in

his hand)

CAPTAIN
What are you going to do with it

MAJOR WHITE

Take it downstairs and have it
analyzed

(on his way to the

door shaking his

head)

Then dont know whether Ill just
get drunk or give up the practice of
medicine
As he starts out the door to the corridor he passes Mr
Harley who is on his way in carrying his ever-present brief
case Harley is accompanied by an enlisted MP

FIRST MAJOR
Afternoon Mr Harley

HARLEY
Afternoon gentlemen

Harley goes to the door of Klaatus room a businesslike
expression on his face He knocks on the door then enters
The MP remains in the sitting room

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - FULL SHOT - DAY

as Harley enters Klaatu is up out of bed walking around in
a Medical Corps robe and pajamas He appears to be completely
recovered

HARLEY

Good afternoon

(surprised not to

find him in bed)

Im glad to see you up and around

KLAATU
Thank you Have you any news

HARLEY

Not very good news Im afraid

(digs into his

briefcase for some

papers)

The President accepted your suggestion
and cabled the invitations for a

meeting last night

(grimly)
Let me read you some of the replies
(he selects a cable

and reads)

The Premier wishes to inform the
Government of the United States that
it will be impossible for him to

attend the meeting suggested by the
President unless the meeting is held
in Moscow

(with a grimly-pointed

glance at Klaatu

Harley reads another

cable)

The suggestion of the President
regarding the possibility of a meeting
in Moscow would be unacceptable to
Her Majestys Government at the
present time Representation could
be sent only if the meeting were
held in Washington

(he looks up at Klaatu

and shrugs)

Well -- there you have it

Harley extends a sheaf of cables for Klaatus inspection

but he ignores them Klaatu has listened to this recital

first incredulously then with mounting indignation Conscious
of his quiet Olympian wrath Harley continues uncomfortably

HARLEY

tried to make you understand The
suspicions -- the jealousies -- the
mistrust--

(uneasily under

Klaatus level gaze)

Surely you realize that my government
has done everything in its power--
KLAATU
Its not your government Im thinking
about Its your world

HARLEY

Now that you understand the situation
more clearly perhaps youd like to
discuss the matter with the President

KLAATU

(sternly)

will not speak to any one nation

or group of nations

(sharply bitterly)

dont intend to add my contribution
to your childish jealousies and
suspicions

HARLEY

Our problems are very complex Mr
Klaatu You mustnt judge us too
harshly

KLAATU
can judge only by what see

HARLEY
Your impatience is quite
understandable

KLAATU

(sharply)

am impatient with stupidity My
people have learned to live without
it

HARLEY
(ruefully)
Im afraid my people havent
(with real sincerity)

Im very sorry -- wish it were
otherwise

Reluctantly Harley has picked up his hat and brief case He
finds Klaatu staring out the window

CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

As he looks out the window thoughtfully What he sees has
given him an idea

MED SHOT - HOSPITAL GROUNDS

shooting down from Klaatus viewpoint at people strolling
about the hospital grounds Most of them are civilian
visitors but there is a sprinkling of nurses and ambulatory
patients

FULL SHOT - HOSPITAL ROOM

As Klaatu turns back to Harley he speaks thoughtfully
incisively

KLAATU

CAMERA is on the back of a man dressed in a business suit
who is walking along the sidewalk of a dimly lighted almost
deserted middle-class street He carries a suitcase and he
glances idly at the drab-looking stone facades of the old
two-story houses As he passes from the open windows of the
houses come the voices of radio announcers We get a sentence
or two from one house and then as the man and our CAMERA
pass on this voice fades and another is picked up We get

the impression that everyone is glued to his radio

RADIO VOICES

(over scene)

--authorities at Walter Reed Hospital
refused to comment on how he managed
to escape or what measures might be
taken to apprehend him

--these fantastic descriptions of the creature are denounced
as rumor by police Chief Walter Baxter He is not eight feet
tall as reported -- nor does he have tentacles in place of
arms--

--theres no denying that there is a monster at large --

that we are dealing with forces beyond our knowledge and
power The public is urged to take ordinary precautions and
to remain calm as we await further developments--

--three separate reports of people who claim to have seen
the space man in the past hour One from Des Moines lowa
one from a village in northern Florida and one from Chicago

As they finish their coffee all except Helen are immersed

in the Sunday papers Helen seems preoccupied with her own
thoughts From a portable radio on the table comes Gabriel
Heaters voice

GABRIEL HEATERS VOICE

--and so this Sunday morning we
ask the question thats been plaguing
the entire nation for two days now
Where is this creature and what is
he up to If he can build a space
ship that can fly to Earth -- anda
robot that can destroy our tanks and
guns -- what other terrors can he
unleash at will Obviously we

must find this monster We must track
him down like a wild animal and
destroy him

It is a full page layout in the style of the American Weekly

all over the world to meet with him in Washington and study

the recently landed Space Ship

CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

His face is thoughtful as he finishes reading This story
seems to impress and interest him Then suddenly he finds
his attention caught at what the Radio Voice is saying

GABRIEL HEATERS VOICE

But where would such a creature hide
himself Would he disappear into the
north woods Or would he slither off
into the sewers of some great city

Klaatu has a reaction of affronted dignity at this monstrously
distasteful idea

GROUP SHOT
AS THE RADIO VOICE CONTINUES

GABRIEL HEATERS VOICE
There is grave danger -- everyone
agrees to that The question is what
can we do to protect ourselves What
measures can we take that will--

During the above Mrs Barley has turned to her husband in
sharp annoyance

MRS BARLEY
George wish youd turn that radio
off Im trying to concentrate

Mr Barley reaches out and snaps off the radio

his paper down)

Why doesnt the Government do
something -- thats what want to
know

MR KRULL

(mildly)

What can they do Theyre only people --
Just like us

MR BARLEY
People my foot Theyre Democrats

MR KRULL

Its enough to give you the shakes
Hes got that robot standing there --
ten-foot tall -- just waiting for

orders to destroy us

HELEN
(thoughtfully)
This space man -- or whatever he is
We automatically assume hes a
menace Maybe he isnt at all

(glaring at her for

this silly notion)

Then whats he hiding for Why doesnt
he come out in the open

MR KRULL

Yeah

(indicating the radio)

Like the fella says Whats he up
to

HELEN
Maybe hes afraid

MRS BARLEY
(with a derisive snort)
Hes afraid

HELEN

After all he was shot the moment he
landed here

(she pauses for a

moment thoughtfully)

was just wondering what would
do

KLAATU

(to Helen helpfully)

Perhaps before deciding on a course
of action youd want to know more
about the people here -- to orient
yourself in a strange environment

MRS BARLEY
(sharply)
Theres nothing strange about
Washington Mr Carpenter

KLAATU

(quietly tongue in

cheek)

A person from another planet might
disagree with you

MRS BARLEY

If you want my opinion he came from
right here on Earth

(with significant

emphasis)

And you know where mean

MR KRULL
They wouldnt come in a space ship
Theyd come in airplanes

MRS BARLEY

(as though with

superior knowledge)

wouldnt be so sure about that

MR BARLEY

(delivering the final

word)

Stands to reason that fella wants
some thing or he wouldnt be here
(facing Klaatu)

That make sense Carpenter

Klaatu pauses for a moment then recites pleasantly

KLAATU

Mrs Crockett enters and speaks to Helen

And outside the Earths atmosphere a
good deal faster

grinning One of them whispers to the other behind the back
of his hand Then the man realizes that Klaatu has stopped
speaking and is looking at him

Pulled out of his reverie Klaatu glances down at Bobby and

comfortably shabby disarray with papers and books everywhere
Theres a battered old desk and a day bed One wall is solid
bookshelves and on the other two are blackboards covered

with a fantastic array of complex equations graphs and
diagrams

equations in a chalky scrawl involving angles of vector
Keplerian ellipses etc The final equations are unsolved
they have no answers after the equals sign Across are
little printed signs tacked to the blackboard reading Dont

and tries to peer in through the curtained doors He absently
tries the doors and finds them locked Then he turns away

with a disappointed but philosophical shrug

Do you realize the Professor has

been working on that problem for

How did you get in here And what do
you want

HILDA

Well hes not here And he wont be
back till this evening

Unruffled Klaatu turns to the desk
and scribbles something on a scratch
pad He tears off the piece of paper
and hands it to Hilda

KLAATU

You might keep this

(with easy assurance)

think the professor will want to
get in touch with me

With a polite nod he goes out the French doors followed by
Bobby Hilda eyes the door for a moment then glances down
at the paper in her hand disturbed and puzzled by this
stranger Her glance wanders to the blackboard and she picks
up an eraser debating whether to erase Klaatus corrections
At that moment the French door opens and Klaatu sticks his
head in Startled Hilda drops the eraser

KLAATU

(pointing to the

blackboard)

wouldnt erase that The Professor
needs it very badly

And he disappears leaving Hilda to glare after him in

impotent rage Deciding that this man is either a crackpot

or a menace she goes to the telephone on the desk and starts
dialing a number

Do you think theyd accept these
CLOSE SHOT - KLAATUS HAND

Sparkling in his palm are eight or ten cut diamonds of various
sizes

TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND BOBBY
The boy is staring at the stones in wide-eyed amazement

BOBBY
Gee -- those look like diamonds

KLAATU

Some places thats what people use
for money Theyre easy to carry --
and they dont wear out

BOBBY

(staring at them

fascinated)

Bet theyre worth about a million
dollars

KLAATU
Would you give me your two dollars
for a couple of them

BOBBY

(with a nervous unsure
smile)

Well sure but--

The boy studies Klaatus face to see if hes kidding
Realizing that hes not Bobbys face takes on a childishly
shrewd expression -- as though he were about to trade a
jackknife for an ocean liner
BOBBY
(slowly)
Okay

The boy takes out two dollar bills and offers them almost
challengingly Klaatu takes the bills and hands Bobby two
good-sized Diamonds They study their new acquisitions with
interest Bobby looks up from his diamonds to steal a guilty
glance at Klaatu

BOBBY
Lets not say anything to my mother
about this Mr Carpenter

KLAATU
(mildly curious)
Why not Bobby

BOBBY

(gravely)

She doesnt like me to steal from
people

EXT BOARDINGHOUSE STREET - MED SHOT - NIGHT

An inexpensive convertible -- a 1948 Ford or Chevrolet --
drives up and stops in front of the house Helen and Tom are
in it

INT CONVERTABLE - TWO SHOT - HELEN AND TOM

You get the feeling that Helen and Ton have spent a very
enjoyable day together and are reluctant to say goodnight
Tom puts his arm around her and kisses her

HELEN
(fondly)
It was a wonderful day

TOM
You still havent answered my
question

HELEN

(warmly sincere)

You know how feel Tom just

TOM

The boss is leaving for Chicago

In the entrance she turns and waves to Tom He waves back
and drives off slowly Helen lets herself in with her key

INT DOWNSTAIRS HALL - BOARDINGHOUSE

The Detective is putting on his hat and preparing to leave

with Klaatu as Helen enters There is a moment of awkwardness
and confusion as she glances puzzled at the Detective

Bobby runs to her and greets her excitedly

BOBBY
Hi Mom

HELEN

Hello darling

(she kisses Bobby

then turns

questioningly to

Klaatu and the

Detective)

Good evening Mr Carpenter
Klaatu is uneasy but tries not to show it as he smiles in
greeting and introduces the Detective

KLAATU
Mrs Benson -- this is Mr Brady

BOBBY
(Impressively)
Mr Bradys a cop

Helen glances quickly at the Detective then at Klaatu
surprised and troubled She turns to Bobby to cover her
confusion

HELEN
(to Bobby)
Did you have a nice day dear

BOBBY

(enthusiastically)

Boy we had a swell time Didnt we
Mr Carpenter

KLAATU
We certainly did

BOBBY

We went to the movies -- and we had
ice cream cones -- and we went to
see Daddy--

HELEN

(moved and grateful

shes uneasy and

concerned as she

turns to Klaatu)

dont know how to thank you
KLAATU
enjoyed every minute of it

DETECTIVE
(with quiet insistence)
We better get goin Mr Carpenter

As Klaatu nods and prepares to follow him Bobby speaks to
Klaatu

BOBBY
Aw gee -- we didnt finish our story

KLAATU
Well finish it tomorrow Goodnight
Bobby

BOBBY
(reluctantly)
Goodnight

Klaatu and the Detective nod to Helen and they go out Helen
watches the door close with real concern wondering why the

police want Klaatu and hoping he hasnt done anything wrong
Still disturbed she turns to lead Bobby upstairs

HELEN
Come on Bobby Time to go to bed

BOBBY

(he followers her

then hesitates)

Mom -- why does Mr Carpenter have
to go down to the police station

HELEN
-- dont know dear Perhaps
theres some mistake
This satisfies him for the moment -- even though it doesnt
satisfy Helen He is climbing the stairs beside her

BOBBY

We sure had fun today We saw the
space ship and we went to see
Professor Barnhardt -- and--

HELEN

(flashing him a
puzzled incredulous
look)

Professor Barnhardt

BOBBY

(almost ignoring the

interruption)

Yeah sure Mom do have to go to
school tomorrow

HELEN
Of course dear

BOBBY
Aw gee Mom -- had plans to play
with Mr Carpenter

DISSOLVE TO
INT POLICE STATION - FULL SHOT - NIGHT

The place is crowded and there is a feeling of feverish but
well-ordered activity Unidentified people who have been
picked up in the search for the space man are being screened
by the police They are all men -- all between forty and

sixty years old -- and they are from all walks of life A

series of desks have been arranged in a row with signs over
them reading IDENTIFICATION At each desk is a team of cops
and before each desk is a line of men waiting to be screened
At the far end of the room Klaatu can be seen at the desk of

a Police Lieutenant with the detective who picked him up

MED CLOSE SHOT

Shooting over the shoulders of two cops at one of the desks

middle-aged vagrant stands before the desk as one of the
cops flips through a card file

FIRST COP

(to the cop beside

him)

BM Alberts -- no prior arrests

SECOND COP

(to the vagrant)

No identification

(the man shakes his
head dully)

The man is taken out of the line as CAMERA MOVES ON to the
next desk with another pair of cops and another line A

rather distinguished-looking business man is placing a sheaf

of identification cards and papers on the desk

BUSINESSMAN
My wife just arrived with my
identification

One of the cops at the desk glances over the papers and nods
to the man

Sometimes a record comes in handy
(and he moves off)

MED CLOSE SHOT - AT LIEUTENANTS DESK

A Detective Lieutenant in plain clothes is questioning Klaatu
who stands beside the Detective who brought him in The
Lieutenant is a rugged but dignified man about fifty
intelligent and businesslike

LIEUTENANT

The Professors secretary says she
found you in Barnhardts room making
marks on his blackboard

KLAATU
was only trying to be helpful He
was having difficulty with a problem

The Lieutenant exchanges a look with the Detective
LIEUTENANT

(sardonically)

Oh see He was having trouble and
you were helping him out

KLAATU
(pleasantly)
Thats right

LIEUTENANT

(quietly sharp and

accusing)

suppose you know that Barnharat
does a lot of secret work for the
Army

KLAATU

In this case the secret wouldnt be

worth much He doesnt know the answer
himself

LIEUTENANT
(growing impatient)
But suppose you know the answer

KLAATU

(with a deprecating

shrug)

Its really quite simple The three-
body problem you know

The lieutenant shifts in his chair annoyed that he has to
deal with this madman He glances at a report on his desk
trying to control his impatience

LIEUTENANT
Your names Carpenter -- that right
(Klaatu nods)

Any identification Mr Carpenter
Drivers license -- social security
number

KLAATU
No -- Im afraid not

LIEUTENANT
Well how do know who you are

KLAATU
(secretly amused)
You dont

The Lieutenant is turning away in exasperation as a uniformed
cop comes into the scene

COP

Excuse me Lieutenant --

(pointing offscene)

The Doc says this man needs treatment
right away

MED SHOT

A man about forty-five bloodied and badly beaten is being
supported and half-carried by two policemen A police doctor

is guiding them to a doorway near which is a sign INFIRMARY
The man is almost unconscious incapable even of holding up
his head

MED CLOSE SHOT - AT LIEUTENANTS DESK

LIEUTENANT
Whats the story

COP
Some fella caught him lookin in a
window and figured he was the space
man The whole neighborhood went
crazy and they ganged up on him
Would have killed him if we hadnt
come along Turns out he was just
a prowler

The Lieutenant grimaces his disgust and impatience with mob
violence

LIEUTENANT
Okay -- book him and get him fixed
up

(the cops nods and

goes and the

Lieutenant growls as

he turns back to

Klaatu and the

Detective)

Looks like everybodys goin nuts

KLAATU

(appalled by what he

has seen and heard)

They would have killed this man

LIEUTENANT

(gruffly)

People get hysterical enough they
do anything

(impatiently)

Look Mr Carpenter -- if you cant
identify yourself got to send you
over to the Army

KLAATU
(pretending impatience
but actually growing
concerned)
How long will that take

LIEUTENANT

They can tell right away Theyve
got a couple of doctors who saw this
man in the hospital

(to the Detective)

Take him over to G2

Really concerned now Klaatu tries to find a way out He
attempts an authoritative air

KLAATU
Its very important Lieutenant
that see Professor Barnhart

DETECTIVE
Come on Mr Carpenter--

Shaking off the Detectives hand Klaatu speaks to the
Lieutenant

KLAATU
May suggest that you call the
Professor

LIEUTENANT

(all patience gone)

Get going will you Brady -- before
get mad

The Detective takes Klaatus arm and leads him toward the
door As they go they pass a Military Police Captain who
makes his way straight to the Lieutenants desk

EXT POLICE STATION - TWO SHOT - KLAATU AND DETECTIVE
as they come out of the station Klaatu hesitates a moment
looks around His face reveals nothing but he seems to be
momentarily considering the idea of making a break The
Detective sensitive to such a possibility hooks his arm

under Klaatus and nods his head toward the sidewalk in silent
command Klaatu allows himself to be led off

MED SHOT

as the Detective leads Klaatu across the sidewalk to the
curb where a police car is standing Parked just behind it
is an Army staff car

Wait a minute Brady--

(indicating orders in

his hand)

The Captain heres got orders from
General Cutler to take this man over

(to Klaatu firmly but
respectfully)

Will you come with me Sir

MED SHOT
as Klaatu gets out of the police car and the Captain escorts
him toward the staff car Passing the Lieutenant Klaatu
speaks with a polite smile a smile that might be one of
mild triumph

KLAATU
Sorry to trouble you Lieutenant

The Lieutenant reacts with impatient exasperation as the
Captain holds the staff car door open for Klaatu who steps
into the Army vehicle as we--

DISSOLVE TO
INT HALLWAY - BARNHARDTS HOUSE - NIGHT

as the MP Captain and Klaatu enter the front door which

is held open for then by Hilda She gestures them toward the
half-open door of Barnhardts study where Barnhardt can be
seen puzzling over the problem on the blackboard The Captain
knocks on the open door to attract his attention and enters

with Klaatu

INT BARNHARDTS STUDY

Barnhardt turns from his deep preoccupation at the blackboard
chalk in hand

MP CAPTAIN
This is the man you wanted to see
Professor

BARNHARDT
(studying Klaatu
curiously)

Thank you Captain

MP CAPTAIN
Ill wait outside

He steps out into the hall closing the door Barnharadt
continues to study Klaatu for a moment then points to the
notations he made on the blackboard There is a controlled
but anxious excitement in Barnhardts attitude

BARNHARDT
You wrote this

KLAATU

(nodding easily)

It was a clumsy way to introduce
myself -- but understand youre a
difficult man to see

(glancing at the

blackboard

reproachfully)

thought youd have the solution by
this time

BARNHARDT
Not yet Thats why wanted to see
you

Klaatu glances at the work Barnhardt has been doing on the
board Then he points to one of the expressions in an
equation

KLAATU

All you have to do now is substitute
this expression--

(pointing to a specific

place)

--at this point

Impressed and interested Barnhardt tugs at his chin as he
studies and weighs the results
BARNHARDT

(slowly thoughtfully)

Yes -- that will reproduce the first-
order terms But what about the effect
of the other terms

KLAATU
Almost negligible With variation
of parameters this is the answer

BARNHARDT
How can you be so sure Have you
tested this theory

KLAATU

(with a slight smile)

find it works well enough to get

me from one planet to another
(Barnhardt stares at

him blankly)

understand youve called a meeting
to study our space ship

BARNHARDT
As though unsure of what hes heard)
Yes -- yes have

KLAATU

My name is Klaatu

(noting that

Barnhardts expression

is changing from

amazement to

incredulity)

spent two days at your Walter Reed
Hospital Room 309 My doctors name
was Major White -- and had a very
attractive nurse called Ruth whos
getting married next Wednesday
(Klaatu waits for

this to sink in

then speaks with

quiet authority)

If you are not interested -- or if

you intend to turn me over to your
Army -- we neednt waste any more
time

Barnhardt hesitates for a long thoughtful moment Then he
goes to the door opens it and speaks to the Captain outside

BARNHARDT

(to the Captain his

voice a little

unsteady)

You can go now Captain Please thank
General Cutler and tell him -- tell

him that know this gentleman

Barnhardt closes the door and turns to find Klaatu watching
him with a faint smile Barnhardt sinks into a chair trying
to adjust his mind

KLAATU

(dryly)
You have faith Professor Barnhardt

BARNHARDT

It isnt faith that makes good
science Mr Klaatu Its curiosity
(unable to conceal

his interest)

Sit down please have several
thousand questions to ask you
KLAATU

(ignoring the

invitation)

would like to explain something of
my mission here

BARNHARDT
That was my first question

KLAATU

(with some bitterness)

It was my intention to discuss this
Officially -- with all the nations

of the Earth -- but was not allowed
the Opportunity have come to
realize since that your mutual fears
and suspicions are merely the normal
reactions of a primitive society
(gathering his thoughts)

We know from scientific observation
that you have discovered a rudimentary
kind of atomic energy We also know
that you are experimenting with
rockets

BARNHARDT
Yes -- that is true

KLAATU

In the hands of a mature civilization
these would not be considered weapons
of aggression But in the hands of

your people--

(he shrugs and shakes

his head)

Weve observed your aggressive
tendencies and we dont trust you

with such power
BARNHARDT

(puzzled)

If you mean that you are afraid of
us--

KLAATU

(with cool impressive

emphasis)

We want to be sure you dont make --
let us say -- an unfortunate mistake
We know the potentiality of these
developments and we are disturbed to
find them in the hands of children
You see weve had atomic energy for
five thousand of your years
(indicating the

telephone)

We discarded instruments like this
many centuries ago

(he paces thoughtfully)

So long as you were limited to
fighting among yourselves -- with
your primitive tanks and planes --

we were unconcerned But soon you
will apply atomic energy to space
ships -- and then you become a threat
to the peace and security of other
planets That of course we cannot
tolerate

BARNHARDT

(thoughtful and

impressed)

These other planets -- do they have
peace and security

KLAATU
We had our atomic wars -- thousands
of years ago

(he smiles wryly)

After that we fought with bows and
arrows Then slowly we learned
that fighting is no solution -- that
aggression leads to chaos

BARNHARDT

(with deep conviction)

We scientists understand this Even
we primitive scientists
(Straightforwardly)

What exactly is the nature of your
mission Mr Klaatu

KLAATU

came here to warn you that by
threatening danger your planet faces
danger -- very grave danger am
prepared however to offer a
solution

BARNHARDT
Would you care to be more specific

KLAATU

(evenly)

What have to say must be said to
all concerned

(with a suggestion of

deference to Barnhardt)

It is too important to be entrusted
to any individual

Barnhardt is forced reluctantly to accept Klaatus refusal
to go any further After a moments thought he speaks
seriously but with a twinkle in his eye
BARNHARDT

gather that your efforts on the
official level were not entirely
successful

KLAATU

(sternly as this

unpleasant episode

is recalled)

come to you as a last resort --
and confess that my patience is
wearing thin

(with Jovian annoyance)

Must take drastic action in order
to get a hearing

BARNHARDT

(uneasily)

What -- what sort of action do you
mean

KLAATU

Violent action -- since that seems
to be the only thing you people
understand

(quietly)

Leveling the island of Manhattan
perhaps -- or dropping the Rock of
Gibraltar into the sea

Barnhardt stands staring at him for a moment passes his
hand across his brow Then as Klaatu watches Barnhardt
paces the floor trying to digest what he has heard After a
moment he turns to Klaatu

BARNHARDT
Would you be willing to meet with
the group of scientists am calling
together Perhaps you could explain
your mission to them and they in
turn could present it to their various
peoples

KLAATU
(quietly evenly)
Thats what came to see you about

Barnhardt flings him a glance then looks momentarily
sheepish But his own eagerness carries him on He paces the
floor thoughtfully

BARNHARDT

It is not enough to have men of
science We scientists are too easily
ignored -- or misunderstood We must
get important men from every field
Educators -- philosophers -- church
leaders -- men of vision and
imagination -- the finest minds in

the world

KLAATU
leave that in your hands

BARNHARDT
Youd have no objection to revealing
yourself at this meeting

KLAATU
No -- not at all

BARNHARDT

What about your personal safety in

the meantime What about the Army --
and the police
KLAATU

My name is Carpenter and Im a very
earthy character living ina
respectable boarding house

BARNHARDT

(smiling but a little

concerned)

Im afraid cant offer you any

real protection have no influence
in cases of inter-planetary
conspiracy

KLAATU
Im sure Ill be quite safe until
the meeting

BARNHARDT

(he suddenly pauses

thoughtfully)

One thing Mr Klaatu Suppose this
group should reject your proposals
What is the alternative

KLAATU

(with a sense of quiet
inescapable power)

Im afraid you have no alternative
In such a case the planet Earth
would have to be--

(he looks for the

right word)

--eliminated

The implications of this statement leave Barnhardt speechless
his keen mind reeling
BARNHARDT
Such power exists

KLAATU
assure you such power exists

Barnhardt stands silent for a moment trying to collect his
shattered thoughts Klaatu watches him as he starts pacing
again

BARNHARDT

The people who came to the meeting
must be made to realize this They
must understand what is at stake
(after a thoughtful

moment he looks up)

You mentioned a demonstration of
force--

KLAATU
Yes

BARNHARDT
Would such a demonstration be
possible before the meeting

KLAATU
Yes -- of course

BARNHARDT

Something that would dramatize for
them and for their people the
seriousness of the situation
Something that would affect the entire
planet

KLAATU
(with a nod)
That can easily be arranged

BARNHARDT

(frightened by his

easy assumption of

infinite power)

wouldnt want you to harm anybody --
or destroy anything

KLAATU

(easily)

Why dont you leave it to me Ill
think of something

BARNHARDT

(with a nervous half-

smile)

Maybe a little demonstration

KLAATU

(thinking about it)

Something dramatic -- but not
destructive

(intellectually amused)

Its quite an interesting problem
(Barnhardt nods vaguely)

Would day after tomorrow be all right
Say about noon

Klaatus bland manner leaves Barnhardt shaken almost wishing
hed never started this business

FADE OUT
INT LIVING ROOM - BOARDINGHOUSE - NIGHT

It is about 330 the following evening Helen is sitting in
a chair leafing through a magazine She is dressed to go
out A corner of the dining room can be seen where Mr and
Mrs Barley are playing cards with Mr Krull Mrs Crockett
the landlady enters from the hall on her way to the dining
room and notices Helen

MRS CROCKETT
Going out dear

HELEN
Yes Im waiting for Tom to pick me
up

MRS CROCKETT

(with a shudder)

Personally wont go out after
dark these days

(with an attempt at

slyness)

But then -- Im not courting am

She turns to go on into the dining room and as she does so
almost bumps into Klaatu who is coming out having been
kibitzing the card game

MRS CROCKETT
(thoroughly startled)
Oh -- Mr Carpenter--

Klaatu steps aside as she hurries nervously into the dining
room He turns puzzled to find Helen watching with a slight
smile

KLAATU

Everyone seems so--
(he shakes his hands
to indicate
nervousness)
HELEN
Jittery is the word

Helen watches him a little uneasy in his presence She is
fond of him and she cant help being curious and concerned
about his brush with the police

KLAATU

(with a contemplative

smile)

Bobbys the only person Know who
isnt -- Jittery

HELEN
He has his homework to keep him
occupied

KLAATU
(fondly sincerely)
Hes a fine boy Mrs Benson

HELEN
Naturally think so

KLAATU

Warm and friendly and intelligent--
(thoughtfully)

You know -- hes the only real friend
Ive made since Ive been here

Helen is deeply moved by Klaatus affection for the boy She
tried to dismiss her curiosity about him but she cant She
decides to face it

HELEN

(hesitantly and with

some difficulty)

Mr Carpenter -- this is none of my
business but -- why did that
detective come here last night

KLAATU

(with easy frankness)

Oh -- they just wanted to ask me a
few questions Bobby and tried to
see Professor Barnhardt in the
afternoon but he wasnt in
Apparently they thought was looking
for secrets of some kind

Helen has reacted in puzzlement at this second mention of
Barnhardt They are interrupted by the ringing of the
doorbell Helen goes to answer it

INT HALLWAY

as Helen opens the front door to admit Tom He appears
impatient anxious to get going

HELEN
Hello--

TOM
You ready

HELEN
will be in just a minute

TOM

(a little annoyed

that she hasnt her

coat on he consults

his watch)

The picture starts at eight-fifty

HELEN
(in explanation)
was talking to Mr Carpenter

TOM

(lightly but with

real sarcasm

underneath)

hope Mr Carpenter wont think Im
intruding

Helen tries to shush him to indicate Klaatu is in the next

room when Klaatu appears in the doorway He must have heard
Toms remark and there is an awkward moment Klaatu is
completely unperturbed but Helen is embarrassed

KLAATU
Excuse me was just going up to my
room

HELEN
(guiltily)
Goodnight Mr Carpenter

Klaatu stops and turns to face them pleasantly

KLAATU
Have a good time -- both of you

He goes on up the stairs Helen steers Tom toward the living
room

HELEN

Why dont you wait in here while
get my things

INT LIVING ROOM

As they enter from the hall Helen turns to Tom reproachfully
HELEN

(quietly)
Oh Tom that was awful

TOM

(momentary apologetic)

Im sorry guess Im just tired of
hearing about Mr Carpenter
(Helen shushes him)

dont like the way hes attached
himself to you and Bobby After all
what do you know about him

This touches on Helens own private doubts and she cannot
answer

HELEN
Ill go get my things

She turns quickly and goes into the hall and hurries up the
stairs Tom looks after her dismissing the matter with a
shake of the head and a philosophical sigh Of such stuff
are women made

INT - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Helen reaches the top of the stairs crosses to her room and
grabs a coat off the bed Shes putting it on as she moves
down the hall to Bobbys room the door of which is open
INT BOBBYS ROOM

Bobby is at a table doing his homework and Klaatu has just
finished explaining an arithmetic problem to him as Helen

enters still putting on her coat

KLAATU
(about to leave)

All you have to remember is first
find the common denominator -- then
subtract

BOBBY
Thanks Mr Carpenter

KLAATU
(to Helen pleasantly)
Ill say goodnight again

Helen is embarrassed She would like to apologize for the
awkwardness downstairs but she doesnt quite know how to go
about it

HELEN

Mr Carpenter I--
(its too complicated
she cant do it)
Goodnight

KLAATU

(with a warm smile of
complete understanding
and appreciation)
Goodnight my dear

He turns and goes out closing the door A little distracted
Helen turns to Bobby

HELEN
Go to bed darling You can finish
that in the morning

BOBBY
Okay
Helen watches as he starts to put away his work She wants
to tell him something but finds it difficult to say

HELEN

(hesitantly almost

guiltily)

Bobby -- think it would be better
if we didnt see quite so much of
Mr Carpenter

BOBBY

(shocked and

bewildered)

Gee why Mom Hes my best friend
And hes awful good in arithmetic

He even helps Professor Barnhardt

HELEN
Did you and Mr Carpenter really go
to see Professor Barnhardt

BOBBY

Sure we did He wasnt there but we

went to see him And Mr Carpenter

showed him how to do his arithmetic

Helen is surprised to get this corroboration for Klaatus
story Sensing his mothers uneasiness the boy looks for
something intriguing -- some deep dark secret

BOBBY

(shrewdly)

Mom -- is there something wrong with
Mr Carpenter

HELEN
What do you mean dear
BOBBY

mean -- on account of that policeman
last night

(his eyes light up

hopefully)

You think hes a bank robber maybe
Or a gangster

HELEN

No dear of course not Hes a very
nice man Just think he might prefer
to be left alone Now you get to bed
and forget about it

(she kisses him)

‘Night darling

With a reassuring smile she starts for the door

BOBBY

Goodnight

(stopping her in the

doorway his

imaginative suspicions

mounting)

Hey Mom -- why would he want to be
alone

Not wanting to go into this any further Helen blows him a
kiss and backs out closing the door Bobby stands thinking
for a moment his mind still speculating on all sorts of
wonderful possibilities Still preoccupied he drifts over

to his bed and sits down to take of his shoes He drops the
first one to the floor and is starting on the other when
there is a light rap on his door The door opens and Klaatu
appears

KLAATU
Bobby -- have you a flashlight
BOBBY

(surprised by his

appearance and his

request)

Yeah -- sure

(he goes to a drawer

and gets a large

hand flashlight)

Its a real Boy Scout flashlight

Bobby hands him the light studying his face with eager
curiosity

BOBBY
What do you want it for Mr
Carpenter

KLAATU

(evasively)

Why -- the light in my room went
out

(cutting off further

questions)

Thank you Bobby Goodnight

Klaatu goes out closing the door behind him Bobby hesitates
a moment puzzled and curious Then he goes over to the door
flips off the lights and slowly noiselessly opens the door

a crack so he can peer out into the hall

MED SHOT
shooting down the hall through the crack in Bobbys door
Klaatus door is ajar and through it the lights in his room

can be seen burning brightly Klaatu goes to his door reaches
in and flips off the lights and closes the door He then
scans the hall in both directions Satisfied he isnt seen

INT BUILDING ENCLOSING SPACE SHIP - MED SHOT - GORT -
NIGHT

In the eerie light of the huge building the great robot

stands encased in a solid block of clear transparent plastic
As CAMERA MOVES IN slowly we hear a low whirring sound as
of power being generated A faint glow visible through the
plastic emanates from Gorts body His eyes which seem to
express rage shifts as though he were straining to break
out As the whirring sound and the glow of Gorts body
increase in intensity the sharp edges at the top of the ice-
like block melt into roundness and the plastic starts to

drip away (About 150 folding chairs are arranged on the
floor near the space ship for the meeting tonight)

EXT BUILDING - MED CLOSE SHOT - TWO SOLDIERS

The whirring sound can be heard faintly from inside The two
soldiers standing guard at the door hear the sound and listen
apprehensively The two men exchange an uneasy glance After
hesitating a moment one of them decides to investigate He
turns and goes inside the door

INT BUILDING - MED CLOSE SHOT - THE SOLDIER

As he stops and looks up at the robot his eyes go wide with
terror

CLOSE SHOT - GORT

Gort is an awesome and terrifying sight His head is free
now and he seems to be straining against the plastic which
is dripping down the sides of the block

CLOSE SHOT - SOLDIER

He glances around nervously to see that his companion has
entered the building and is staring up at the robot bug-
eyed Slowly the second soldier moves up beside the first
Wordlessly they bring their rifles up to the ready and click
them off safety In spite of their terror they advance slowly
toward the robot

CLOSE SHOT - GORT

The whirring sound is ominous and his body glows brightly
And his eyes are fixed on the two advancing figures

MED CLOSE SHOT - TWO SOLDIERS

sound And from his eyes two pencils of light dart out After

Rallying all her courage and determination she forces herself
to step inside

He has seen Helen and his flashing eyes bore into her His
upper body and arms are free now and the plastic is rapidly

melting away

She is held fascinated by the robots staring eyes For
another moment it looks as if she would break and run But
she summons all her courage and moves slowly toward Gort
whose legs are still held captive

MED SHOT - HELEN AND GORT

starts backing away keeping her eyes on him

MED SHOT - HELEN AND GORT

As the great hulking figure approaches Helen cant stand
her ground She turns and runs wildly toward the far end of
the building Gort follows her with unhurried inescapable
strides Unwittingly Helen has run into a corner and the
robot is closing in on her

MED CLOSE SHOT - HELEN
Her eyes go wide with terror as she realizes shes trapped
In a wild effort to run around him she stumbles and falls

to the floor Immobilized with fright she lies breathless
looking up at him Then she gives a piercing scream

TWO SHOT - HELEN AND GORT
as the great robot bends over her menacingly arms
outstretched as though to grab or smash her

CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

All hope gone she is blessed with a moment of lucidity and
she remembers the message Klaatu told her to deliver

HELEN

Gort--

(with desperate clarity)

He pauses as he hears the words His face doesnt change
expression but the words obviously have an effect on him
He hesitates thoughtfully for a moment

Helen watches him in an agony of suspense Then the robot
slowly bends down picks her up in his arms and starts walking
toward the space ship

moves slightly out He mounts the ramp still carrying Helen
and disappears into the ship with her And the ramp closes
silently behind them

INT SMALL CORRIDOR - SPACE SHIP
CAMERA FOLLOWS as Gort carries Helen through the dimly lighted

corridor into the main cabin where he flips a switch that
lights up the cabin The robot proceeds to a small door
leading off the main cabin and disappears with Helen inside
it

INT SMALL CABIN - FULL SHOT

This is revealed as a weirdly equipped laboratory the walls
of which are lined with the most complex array of mechanical
and electronic apparatus Gort sets Helen down on a stool
and indicates for her to stay there Too terrified to move
Helen watches as he busies himself with the apparatus He
starts flipping switches and turning dials As a result

lights begin to flash and theres a strange series of
mechanical noises

CLOSE SHOT - HELEN

Unable to guess the reason for these preparations she is
gripped with a terrible fear

FULL SHOT

Ignoring Helen completely Gort finishes his work Then he
moves to the door and goes out closing the door behind him
Helen rushes to the door and searches frantically for the
knob -- only to find to her terror that there is none
Frenziedly she beats on the solid metal door

determined strides he starts toward the entrance of the

moves to one side of the cabin and flips a switch Suddenly
an entire section of the side wall is made transparent
Through it as through a screen we can see out into the
building Most of the chairs are already occupied and
latecomers are still moving in through the door Facing the

called you from your work and from

who came here in this ship

by what he sees His eyes are on the revered figure of Klaatu
and hes debating what he should do

MED CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU

He is a figure of intense dignity in his impressive otherworld
tunic He stares with even defiance at the armed soldiers

as though holding them off by sheer weight of his personality
He turns to look out at the audience which is held
spellbound Then after a breathless moment he speaks

KLAATU

(straightforwardly

with almost stern

authority)

am leaving soon and you will forgive
me if speak bluntly

(he pauses studying

the faces)

The Universe grows smaller every day --
and the threat of aggression by any
group -- anywhere -- can no longer
be tolerated

MED CLOSE SHOT - IN AUDIENCE

of three of the delegates listening intently (These three
are from Russia India and France)

KLAATUS VOICE

(over scene)

There must be security for all -- or
no one is secure This does not
mean giving up any freedom except
the freedom to act irresponsibly

CLOSE SHOT - A DELEGATE
He is an American

KLAATUS VOICE

(over scene)

Your ancestors knew this when they
made laws to govern themselves --
and hired policemen to enforce them

CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU
KLAATU

We of the other planets have long
accepted this principle We have an
organization for the mutual protection
of all planets -- and for the complete
elimination of aggression A sort of
United Nations on the Planetary
level The test of any such higher
authority of course is the police
force that supports it For our
policemen we created a race of robots--
(indicating Gort)

Their function is to patrol the

planets -- in space ships like this

one -- and preserve the peace In
matters of aggression we have given
them absolute power over us

MED CLOSE SHOT - GORT

emphasizing his great size and inscrutable expression The
normal blinking of his piercing eyes as he gazes imperturbably
at the audience is his only movement

KLAATUS VOICE

(over scene)

At the first sign of violence they
act automatically against the
aggressor And the penalty for
provoking their action is too terrible
to risk

CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU
KLAATU

The result is that we live in peace
without arms or armies secure in
the knowledge that we are free from
aggression and war -- free to pursue
more profitable enterprises

(after a pause)

We do not pretend to have achieved
perfection -- but we do have a system --
and it works

(with straightforward

candor)

came here to give you the facts

It is no concern of ours how you run
your own planet -- but if you threaten
to extend your violence this Earth

of yours will be reduced to a burned-
out cinder

QUICK REACTION CUTS

of four delegates reflecting their stark terror and
bewilderment And a cut of the Colonel and the soldiers
impressed and held by what Klaatu is saying

MED CLOSE SHOT - KLAATU
CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY as he concludes quietly incisively

KLAATU

Your choice is simple Join us and
live in peace Or pursue your present
course -- and face obliteration

We will be waiting for your answer
decision rests with you
