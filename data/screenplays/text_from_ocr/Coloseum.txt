FADE IN
ROCKY LANDSCAPE

Noonday heat shimmers Sun bleaches all color from the scene
We HEAR the slow rhythmic CLANG of iron on stone

SUPER DEIS SOLIS (Sunday)
ANGLE - MAN

Crushes rock with iron shaft MARCUS CALIDIUS REGULUS 32
wears slave’s tunic and shackles Pauses from labor

Wipes sweat from unshaven face Surveys surroundings
WIDER - MARBLE QUARRY

Hundreds of SLAVES stab at an unyielding Earth watched by
GUARDS armed with sword and spear

SUPER QUARRIES AT ALBULAE 80 AD
BACK ON - MARCUS

Notes altercation down the hillside

EXT QUARRY - DAY

Four SLAVES of mixed races surround ELDERLY SLAVE emaciated
and shriveled by forced labor All in shackles

MARCUS’ VOICE (0S)
Citizens

INCLUDE —- MARCUS
Stopped a few metres off five-foot iron pike in hand

MARCUS
What harm has the old man done you

The predatory Slaves do not seem intimidated

SLAVE 1
One less mouth to feed more food
for us

MARCUS

Ah the Imperial Age
He takes a step forward iron shaft in both hands now
MARCUS (CONT’D)

Leave him He can have half my
share
The four Slaves turn to meet Marcus as one Threatening

MARCUS (CONTD)
Wait

(points off)
See that man

ANOTHER ANGLE - GIANT SLAVE

Homunculus from the primaeval forests of Gaul Brain eater
Beyond terror

MARCUS (CONTD)
He receives the other half Small
price to pay for friendship

The slave gang takes pause
EXT QUARRY - LATER

Marcus sits with Elderly Slave in the shade of a rocky ledge
The old man accepts a water skin from his benefactor

ELDERLY SLAVE
The gods will look favorably on
you my son

MARCUS
Marcus Calidius Regulus
(beat)
The gods don’t know me from a clod
of dirt

Elderly Slave drinks greedily water spilling across his
chin

MARCUS (CONTD)
Easy Water’s more precious than
gold in the quarries of Albulae

The ancient savors the wondrous elixir

ELDERLY SLAVE
I was an important man once

MARCUS
You don’t say

ELDERLY SLAVE
Vibius Seius Aculeo Nero’s favored
sail-master

MARCUS
Careful Mention of our former
emperor invites “permanent” rebuke

Elderly Slave grows wistful lost in memory
ELDERLY SLAVE
I can almost hear the rustle of
leaves blowing outside my villa at
Antium

Marcus nods according the old man’s memories their due
MARCUS
(philosophical)

What choice but to play the die we
cast

The Elderly Slave regards Marcus with warm sad eyes
VIBIUS
Marcus Calidius I would like to
repay you for the kindness you’ve
offered me today
Marcus offers only a nice smile in return All ears
EXT QUARRYGARDEN PLOT - DUSK
Behind the guards’ barracks At far end BEE HIVES

Marcus keeps lookout as corrupt GUARD crouches and removes
the prisoner’s shackles

MARCUS
Easiest fifty denarii you ever
made

The Guard stands Hold out his palm Anxious

GUARD
Not until I make it

Marcus grins Turns to nearest BEE HIVE and carefully
extracts a few coins he’d hidden inside it

He drops the coins in the Guard’s palm as a few BEES buzz
harmlessly around their heads

MARCUS
Tell him
(cryptically)
IT let him catch me

The Guard has no idea what Marcus is talking about but is
keen on leaving the scene of his crime

GUARD
Off with you

He turns and quickly leaves in the direction of the barracks
Marcus waits a few moments watching to see the Guard is
gone then extracts more coins from his stash in the hive
Turns to leave

REVERSE ANGLE - SLAVE GANG and GIANT GAUL

Stand in his path

Apparently the gang has realized the Giant Gaul is not in
actuality Marcus’ ally None are happy about the deception

Marcus seems neither surprised or concerned
MARCUS
Citizens one difference now
between you and me

He holds up his shackles

MARCUS (CONTD)
Ability of flight

Marcus kicks the leg out from nearest BEE HIVE sending it
toppling to the rocky ground

Insanely angry BEES swarm as Marcus easily evades attack and
flees the scene

Shackled prisoners suffer much different fate

EXT ROME - DAY

City of gleaming marble Center of the known world
SUPER DEIS LUNAE (Monday)

EXT ROMESTREET - MORNING

Crowded with busy Romans from all walks of life Hustle and
bustle of a thriving metropolis

tunic Confident stride like he owns this city

WIDER
Marcus turns entering through gate of a grand town house
INT TOWN HOUSE - MORNING

Marcus is led by a handsome male SLAVE through the elegant
home of silks and cool shadow to
EXT TOWN HOUSEGARDEN - MORNING

A corpulent GAIUS ACILIUS BARBA 50’s oversees SLAVES
tending to exotic flowers He wears a toga picta dyed solid
purple and embroidered with gold

The older man seems mildly surprised to see Marcus

GAIUS
Marcus Calidius I’d heard you were
dead

MARCUS

My apologies if I disappoint
(re Gaius’ toga)
Were you named emperor in my

absence

GAIUS
Enjoying my retirement many
thanks

Marcus casts a jaundice eye toward the comely MALE SLAVE
replenishing his master’s wine goblet

GAIUS (CONTD)
Don’t judge All of this you see
here I earned --

MARCUS
Stole

GAIUS
-- through dint of my hard labor

MARCUS
You took your cut

GAIUS
(with a shrug)
There are worse scoundrels than I

MARCUS
But few with greater appetites

GAIUS
I am imperious to flattery snipe
(beat)
What do you have for me

MARCUS
And spoil your retirement

GAIUS
(irritably)
Be quick I’m overdue a nap
MARCUS
Nero’s lost treasure trove

GAIUS
Nero’s treasure trove is “lost”
because no one knows where it is

MARCUS
I do

Gaius absorbs the statement Suddenly somber
GAIUS

Marcus Calidius don’t excite with
frivolous claim

MARCUS

I speak the truth
GAIUS

Can it be taken
MARCUS

Anything can be taken
GAIUS

Where
MARCUS

(sly grin)

In due time Gaius Acuilius
GAIUS

How did you come by this secret
MARCUS

Nero’s sail master told me
GAIUS

Not executed along with everyone

else
Marcus shakes his head no

MARCUS
I tracked him from a Tullianum
dungeon to the salt mines of Lake
Tritonis and finally the quarries
at Albulae

GAIUS
Your capture after that adventure
on the Aventine was inauthentic

An arch look from Marcus “Please”

Gaius can’t disguise his admiration Weighs decision
GAIUS (CONTD)
It’s difficult to say yes when I
don’t know what I say yes to

MARCUS
Say “yes” to gold Gaius Acilius A
lot of gold

GAIUS
How many men of your prior league

MARCUS
All of them

GAIUS
Sounds expensive

MARCUS

Ten thousand sestertii will do the
trick

Gaius visibly blanches

GAIUS
An Olympian investment

MARCUS
Considering the reward Not so
much
A moment as Gaius broods
GAIUS
I have all the gold I’1l1 ever need
But to deny our brute of an emperor
what he so fervently desires
(beat)
Id give one hundred thousand
sesterii
Marcus smiles Turns to go as we CUT TO
EXT ROMEMARKET PLACE (LUKUANI) - DAY

Travelers from abroad and provincials mix easily with Roman
citizens

Anything and everything the empire has to offer is for sale
ANGLE - VESTAL VIRGIN

Wearing a narrow headband and veil She is a vision of chaste
beauty and pious regard

Presents a NECKLACE to WEALTHY COUPLE from Cyrenaica
VESTAL VIRGIN
Honored guests the inherent
blessings of the necklace are
undisputed

RICH CYRENAICIAN LADY
(breathless)
Might I hold it

The Vestal Virgin lays the “holy” beads in the wealthy
tourist’s open hands

VESTAL VIRGIN
For the duration of Parentalia it
graced the neck of goddess Vesta
herself

RICH CYRENAICIAN LADY
I feel its divine power husband

RICH CYRENAICIAN GUY
(to Vestal Virgin)
Worn by the temple statue

VESTAL VIRGIN
Placed there by my own hands

MANS VOICE (0S)
Ten denarii

INCLUDE —- MARCUS
Who has approached from the side

MARCUS
Forget ten I’1l give you twenty
(re necklace)
What better way to display one’s
moral purpose

Vestal Virgin anxious to calm her buyers’ jitters shoots
Marcus a look

VESTAL VIRGIN
Transaction of money would only
diminish the presence of our
goddesses’ spirit in the artifact
A lit candle at her altar Or
offering a cup of wine perhaps

MARCUS
A cup of wine
(pointed to Rich Guy)
Money is something even the gods
can appreciate

The Rich Cyrenaician Guy gets the hint
RICH CYRENAICIAN GUY
Forty denarii

MARCUS
(with broad grin)
Victory is yours citizen

The Rich Cyrenaician Guy hastily drops the coins in the
Vestal Virgin’s open palm as we CUT TO

EXT ROMESTREET - MOMENTS LATER

Marcus catches up with the Vestal Virgin just outside the
market

MARCUS
Wait

JULIA NOVELLA 27 stops Flatly

JULIA
I’m with Lucius now

Marcus reacts disheartened

JULIA (CONTD)
I thought you were dead

MARCUS

A common mistake

(re her clothing)
Do you know what they do to Vestals
who break the vow of chastity
Buried alive at Campus Sceleratus
Hate to think what they do when
they catch imposters

JULIA
I don’t get caught unlike some
people I know

MARCUS
Arrest isn’t so bad if you know
how to get away
(beat)
Why this poor temper Forty denarii
is four times your usual take

JULIA
Somehow I’ve managed to survive
without you
(beat)
What do you want Why are you
bothering me

MARCUS
I need a reason to see you again
after two years of forced labor
harsh beatings and enslavement

JULIA
Perhaps you didn’t hear me the
first time I’m with Lucius now

MARCUS
It won’t last I know you better
than you know yourself
(beat)
Lucius too safe a bet for the likes
of you Not enough excitement

JULIA
Exciting enough

She turns to go He calls after her

MARCUS
How many more wooden beads do you
have to sell to provincial rubes
before you can buy your parents
that villa outside Pompeii

Julia stops Faces Marcus again

MARCUS (CONTD)
This one Julia Novella This one
is colossal
(beat)
Convincing the others will not be
difficult believe me

JULIA
Am I the first
MARCUS
Gaius Acilius was first

(beat)
In seven days time you’1l have
enough gold to buy your parents a
hundred villas

Julia says nothing hating herself Marcus takes that as a
“yes”

MARCUS (CONTD)
Good You can help me with Lucius

magnificent racing venue that seats 250000 people

INT CIRCUS MAXIMUS - DAY

Seven CHARIOTS pulled by teams of horses race around the
track cutting in front of opponents so that they CRASH into
the spinae (singular spina)

Marcus and Julia stand at the heightest reaches of the
viewing stands Marcus strains to identify the chariot
drivers

MARCUS
Too far away Which one is he

Julia gives him a flat look
EXT CIRCUS MAXIMUSSTABLES - DAY
A HORSE in its stall seems ready to bolt

LUCIUS ANNEIUS CORVINUS 30s wearing dirty tunic whispers
softly in it’s ear

MAN’S VOICE (0S)
What in Hades do you think you’re
doing

INCLUDE - HORSE TRAINER
50’s rough and with hunched back

LUCIUS
(re horse)
Roar of the crowd makes her
nervous Ulcers too I think

HORSE TRAINER
Babying does them no good
Establish control The sting of a
whip
(beat)
But what’s it to you

The Horse Trainer takes hold of a crude shovel and thrusts it
toward Lucius

HORSE TRAINER (CONT’D)
Your trade is horse shit not
horses

Lucius takes the shovel and starts cleaning out the stall
Horse Trainer watches satisfied then moves on with a grunt

We STAY ON Lucius as he labors the ROAR of the crowd
filtering down from the circuit beyond

As he stands erect to dump a particular noxious load of
manure he stops
ANGLE - MARCUS and JULIA
Stand on the other side of the stall watching him work

MARCUS
I know You heard I was dead

LUCIUS
At this moment I wish you were

Lucius flips the horse-shit into waiting cart

MARCUS
I understand you’ve got to start
somewhere
(re stall)
-but this is ridiculous

Lucius ignores the crack

LUCIUS
(to Julia)
My beauty

JULIA
My heart

LUCIUS
The hours since I saw you last feel
like days

JULIA
Delicious agony

MARCUS
I’m still here you realize

LUCIUS
One wonders why At least I do

MARCUS
(re Julia)
She does not

Lucius looks to Julia

JULIA
Nero’s lost treasure

LUCIUS
What about it

JULIA
Marcus knows where it can be found

MARCUS
(to Lucius)
But you already have an occupation

your lips

(to Marcus and Julia)
And you two Leave this place

MARCUS

(to Trainer re Lucius)
I’ve seen this man out-ride an
entire cohort of Rome’s best
mounted calvary And you give him
shovel

(beat)
Proof the empire is in decline

Lucius tosses the shovel to the Horse Trainer

LUCIUS
It was two cohorts

and follows Julia and Marcus out of there
EXT CIRCUS MAXIMUSROAD - DAY

Marcus Lucius and Julia walk away from the venue toward the
Aventine Patrician class of Roman out in throngs

MARCUS
The wealthy They smell different
(to Lucius)
Well different than you

LUCIUS
Nothing a bath and a found treasure
trove won’t cure

MARCUS

(to Julia)
See what happens when I’m not
around to think for him He
stumbles into an “honest” life

(to Lucius)
We’re born crooks you and I
Useless to pretend otherwise

LUCIUS
Was it horrible Where did your
enslavement take you

MARCUS
Here and there For your next
adventure I can’t recommend Libya

LUCIUS
Your craving for this treasure
borders on obsession friend

MARCUS
I have my reasons
LUCIUS
That’s what concerns me
(beat)
Who is next
MARCUS
All that were once in our league

(beat)
Best if we split up Time is short

Lucius puts a hand on Marcus’ arm stopping him as Julia
continues up the hill We STAY ON Marcus and Lucius

LUCIUS
When we heard you had been arrested
by the Urban Cohort

Marcus holds up a silencing hand

MARCUS
I would’ve done the same

With easy grin Marcus clamps the hand on Lucius’ shoulder

MARCUS (CONTD)
Besides I’1l steal her back

They both turn and continue after Julia

already passed my money to another

SOLDIER
Where did this theft occur

The older man indicates back behind them

OLDER PATRICIAN MAN
Just past the Arch of Augustus
That’s where he bumped into me not

The Older Patrician Man falters not a leg to stand on On-

Of course

Massiva and the Samnite circle one another testing with
feints and exploratory thrusts of their swords

Samnite begins whipping his great sword around and around
faster and faster backing Massiva up as the blade rips the

Massiva armed now only with dagger is up against the wall
Grinning the Samnite raises his sword overhead

Massiva grins right back at him

The smile fades from the Samnite’s face what does Massiva
have to smile about

Massiva reaches down grabs a handful of talc powder off the
floor of the arena and casts it into the Samnites face

The enraged Samnite begins to swing blindly with his sword
Massiva ducks comes up from behind the Samnite and jabs the
man in the back of the neck

No more than a love tap Practically bloodless

in time so as not to get his leg broken

Lucius draws his short sword

Lucius comes after Massiva with the sword Soldiers approach

Massiva takes a SPEAR right out of one of the soldier’s hands

PASSERSBY start to form up around the altercation cheering
the combatants

Massiva takes a swing at Lucius with the spear who ducks
just below its arcone of the soldiers taking the brunt of
a direct hit to the side of his head

Massiva drops the spear turns and starts running

Lucius betrays no reaction Just noting the moment when
Marcus holds up one hand The others quiet down

MARCUS
Today was a good day

This is greeted by more SHOUTING and carrying on

CASTOR
How is your horse doing Lucius
Anneius

LUCIUS

(indicating Massiva)
Ask him how his hand is doing

Massiva turns to Julia andSWINGS the same hard right hand
pulling it just in the last second so that it misses Julia’s
chin and SMACKS into his left palm

Movie punchperfectly timed All LAUGH Marcus holds up his
hand again for quiet

MARCUS
We have much to do still

GAIUS
Because we haven’t actually done
anything yet

This comment is greeted with a CHORUS of BOOS and CATCALLS
Bread is thrown in the mob boss’ direction

Gaius looks to Marcus for assistance

You brought this on yourself

childhood home citizen

That shuts them up Marcus indicates ROUGH TABLE

After my mother was forced to leave
the palace she could only find
work here in this establishment
Where I spent the next ten years of
my life in fact

This is met with brooding silence What child could survive a
place as foul as this
